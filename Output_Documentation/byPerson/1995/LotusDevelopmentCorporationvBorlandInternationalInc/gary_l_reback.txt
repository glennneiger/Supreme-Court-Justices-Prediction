mr.
gary
l.
reback
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
pursuant
to
the
patent
and
the
copyright
clause
of
the
constitution,
congress
enacted
two
regimes
for
the
granting
of
private
monopolies.
one
regime...
under
one
regime,
the
grant
of
private
monopoly
is
done
in
a
wholly
indiscriminate,
uncritical,
unexamined
way,
and
under
the
other
regime,
the
regime
of
patents,
grants
of
private
monopoly
are
made
following
an
exacting
examination
and
the
satisfaction
of
very
high
thresholds.
now,
as
judge
boudin
explained
below,
because
of
the
way
congress
set
up
the
first
regime,
the
regime
of
copyright,
it's
used
for
subject
matter
where
the
damage
to
society
by
a
mistake
in
grant
of
protection
is
not
all
that
great,
where
the
problem
of
overprotection
is
not
something
that
we
should
really
worry
about
because
even
if
we
mistakenly
grant
protection,
the
next
author
can
always
make
a
near
substitute.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
so
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is
that
102(a)
of
the
statute...
the
statute
formerly
read
in
1909,
all
the
writings
of
an
author.
and
that
created
confusion
in
the
case
law,
and
the
language
was
changed
to
make
it
clear
that
not
all
writings
are
copyrightable,
but
rather
that
there
is
a
separate
ambit
for
things
that
we
don't
worry
about
overprotection
and
a
regime
of
patents
in
which
we
do
worry
about
that.
that's
most
directly
set
out
in
102(b).
that's
the
language
that
is
expressly
intended
to
keep
copyright
from
undermining
the
patent
system.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
well,
judge
boudin
had
a
variety
of
things
to
say
in
his
opinion.
but
the
point
that
102(b)
is
intended
to
prevent
overcompensation
to
the
first
author
i
think
comes
through
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
the
statute
doesn't
read
the
idea
of
a
system
is
uncopyrightable.
it
says
a
system
is
uncopyrightable.
it
doesn't
say
the
idea
of
a
method
of
operation
is
uncopyrightable.
it
says
a
method
of
operation
is
uncopyrightable.
if
we
apply
that,
102(b),
to
the
baker
v.
selden
situation,
selden
may
have
had
a
terrific
system,
but
people
had
no
way
to
use
that
system,
or
at
least
to
use
it
efficiently,
until
he
put
some
textual
labels
on
it.
the
same
is
true
of
lotus'
system.
the
only
way
people
can
use
systems
is
through
some
kind
of
textual
label,
and
the
teaching
of
baker
v.
selden
to
us
is
that
the
bare
set
of
words,
through
which
people
use
or
manipulate
or
operate
a
system,
that's
on
the
uncopyrightable
side
of
the
line.
that's
what
102(b)
does.
it
prevents
the
copyright
law
from
undermining
the
ambit
where
we
care
about
overprotection,
where
a
mistake
in
grant
of
overprotection
would
do
real
damage
to
society
because
there's
not
adequacy
of
near
substitutes.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
yes,
we
would
i
think.
but
i
don't
think
this
calls
for...
i
think
the
first
place
to
start--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--i
think
that--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--sure.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
the
labels
that
were
used
in
baker
v.
selden
were
the
labels
of
system
and
method
of
operation.
those
same
labels
are
present
in
102(b).
that
in
our
view
is
the
way
that
this
case
should
be
resolved.
merger
does--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--and
i
would
argue
in
baker
v.
selden,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we
don't
see
the
dichotomy
between
each
of
these
words
and
expression.
as
i
said,
it
doesn't
say
the
idea
of
a
system.
it
says
a
system.
an
expression
is
not
itself
a
defined
term.
sometimes
expression
covers
things
that
are
not
tangible,
like
the
plot
of
a
play.
in
other
situations,
things
that
are
tangible,
like
the
textual
labels
in
baker
v.
selden,
are
uncopyrightable.
the
issue,
the
fundamental
issue,
to
us
of
baker
v.
selden
is
the
distinction
between
the
protection
of
the
utilitarian
and
the
protection
of
these
other
things
which
like
artistic
works
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
overprotection
with
respect
to.
that
was
a
contorted
sentence,
but
i
think
i'm
trying
to
get
that
point--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--and
so
as
there
is
here,
your
honor.
there
is
a
users
manual.
there
is
on-line
help
text.
there
are
long
prompts.
the
issue
is
where
should
the
line
be
drawn.
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
the
district
court
moved
the
line
one
notch
over
from
where
it
had
been
in
baker
v.
selden.
that
movement
had
enormous
ramifications.
all
we've
ever
asked
for
and
all
the
first
circuit
did
was
to
put
the
line
back
where
it
was,
where
it
had
been
100
years.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
my
response
to
that
is
that
this
case
in
many
respects
is
an
easier
case
than
baker
v.
selden
because
in
this
case
you
have
to
use
those
words
to
run
macros.
there
is
that
degree
of
blockage
of
barrier
to
entry
in
this
situation
that
doesn't
exist
elsewhere.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
that's
what--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--the...
i'm
sorry.
the
test
is
the
bare
words
through
which
users
use
or
operate
the
system
is
uncopyrightable.
that
is
the
system
from
the
perspective
of
the
user.
that
would
be
our
description
of
the
test.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
whatever
word...
as
mr.
gutman
said,
you
look
from
the
perspective
of
the
original
developer.
whatever
word
they
choose
to
enable
users
to
operate
the
system,
that
word
is
uncopyrightable--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--if
there
are
5
or
469.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
i
don't
think
you
could
just--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--well,
let
me
respond--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--i'm
saying
the
words
are
inseparable
from
the
system.
but
i
take
your
honor's
point.
the
issue
is
one
of
degree,
as
members
of
this
court
have
pointed
out.
i
can't
use
the
system
efficiently
in
any
respect
by
doing
that
because
it
requires
me
to
use
a
whole
wide
variety
of
keystrokes.
and
if
i
may
make
one
other
point,
your
honor.
with--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--please.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
no,
no.
it
does
not.
and
the
issue
is
where
to
draw
the
line,
and
we
say
you
draw
the
line
between
the
bare
words
that
state
the
system
and
the
users
manual.
the
line
is
someplace
in
there.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
what
they
are
seeking
to
protect
is
the
organization
of
the
words.
the
organization
of
those
words--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
the
bare
set
of
words
through
which
that
organization
is
stated...
in
other
words,
the
bare
set
of
words
through
which
users
can
operate
the
organization
or
manipulate
the
organization...
that's
what
102(b)
puts
off
limits
from
copyright.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
absolutely.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
i
think--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--you
could
use
the
words
in
a
different
context
you
mean,
your
honor--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--well,
the
same
would
be
true--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--the
same
would
be
true
of
the
textual
headings
in
baker
v.
selden.
in
other
words,
baker...
lotus
makes
the
point
that
baker
used
different
words,
but
that
didn't
change
the
copyrightability
of
the
words
that
selden
chose
to
enable
people
to
use
his
system.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
i
see
your
point.
yes,
your
honor.
and
indeed,
it
is
made
all
the
more
acute
by
the
presence
of
macros
because
the
functionality--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--that's
right.
that's
right.
that's
what
makes
it
the
kind
of
situation
that
your
honor
is
describing.
i
did
not
understand
your
honor's
question
and
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
i
did
want
to
point
out--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--in
one
sense,
certainly.
copyright
is
an
economic
calculus,
and
the
issue
is--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--do
we
give
lotus
the
ability
to
put
up
that
barrier
of
entry
or
should
they
have
to
get
a
patent
to
do
that.
that's
our
point.
it's
not
that
they
can't
protect
these
words.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
i'm
sorry,
your...
a
users
manual
would
be
protected
under
the
broad
language
of
102(a).
even--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--the...
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
are...
and
as
your
honor
indicates,
there
are
102(a)
works
here
like
the
users
manual.
they
embody
these
words.
but
i
don't
think
the
words
would
be
102(a)
material,
but
if
they
were,
in
our
view
they'd
be
disqualified
by
102(b).
that's
the
learning
and
that's
where
the
line
is
and
that's
what
the
statute
says.
that...
you
know,
expression
is
not
a
defined
term
in
the
copyright
law
or
in
the
copyright
statute,
and
the
notion
that
it...
that
expression
means
something
textual
is
not
carried
throughout
the
copyright
law.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
the
statute
draws
a
line--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--absolutely,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--well,
the--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--the--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--well,
the
statute
draws
a
line
between
the
computer
program,
which
is
protectable
by
copyright,
and
the
method
of
operating
the
computer
program
which
is
not
protectable
by
copyright.
congress--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--yes.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
an
operating
system
is
a
computer
program.
a
computer
program
is
a
composition.
that
is
copyrightable.
this
is
a
very
important
difference
in
copyright
law.
a
menu
command
hierarchy
is
a
method.
a
computer
program
is
not
a
method.
it's
a
composition.
copyright
protects
compositions.
it's
like
a
method
of
dance
notation,
uncopyrightable,
and
choreography
that
is
copyrightable.
a
method
of
musical
notation
that's
not
copyrightable
and
a
musical
score
that
is
copyrightable.
language
which
is
uncopyrightable,
but
compositions
in
language
that
are
copyrightable.
programs
are
written
in
command
sets
like
the
macro
language.
borland's
program
happens
to
be
written
in
the
method...
the
command
set
called
c,
which
was
created
by
at&t.
copyright
has
always
protected
compositions,
but
has
not
protected
the
underlying
command
sets.
the
reason
the
district
court's
decision
created
such
an
uproar
is
that
it
extended
copyright
from
the
protection
of
compositions
like
the
operating
system
software
to
the
protection
of
methods.
that
has
never
been
done
before.
that
has
all
kinds
of
ramifications
of
the
type
we've
been
discussing
here,
all
untoward
and
should
be,
if
attainable
at
all,
attainable
through
the
patent
law.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
the
method
or
the
system
includes
words,
syntax,
and
grammar,
which
ar
taken
by
someone
who
then,
applying
their
own
sweat,
as
the
user
does
here
with
respect
to
a
macro,
and
their
own
creativity,
creates
a
program.
that's
the
difference
between...
one
should
not
confuse,
we
would
respectfully
submit,
the
syntax
and
grammar
of
the
english
language
with
compositions
written
in
the
english
language.
they're
two
different
things
in
our
view.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
that's
right.
the
first
circuit
views
baker
v.
selden
and
102(b)
as
we
do,
as
creating
a
policy
and
societal
judgment
that
you
need
to
satisfy
the
high
thresholds
of
a
patent
if
you
to...
are
to
control
the
bare
words
through
which
users
manipulate
or
operate
a
system.
that's
where
they
draw
the
line.
that's
where
we
would
draw
the
line
and
that's
where
we
see
the
court
in
baker
v.
selden
drawing
the
line.
the
majority
opinion
in
the
first
circuit,
though,
does
also
refer
to
the
existence
of
macros
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
that
line
is
an
appropriate
societal
line
because
otherwise
people
would
have
to
relearn
a
different
system
for
every
device
that
they
would
operate
and--
mr.
gary

would
agree
with
that.

no.
mr.

we
are
talking

here,

any
objection
to
me
making

making

run

mr.

and
saying
that
in
an

mr.

he
has
great
exception
to
me
allowing
users
to
run
their

on
my

that's
what
he
takes
exception
to.
or
to
use
my
spreadsheet
in
the
way
that
they
have
learned
to
use
spreadsheets.
they've
memorized
keystrokes.
they've
learned
that
system.
he
doesn't
want
them
transporting
that
learning
to
my

he
draws
the
line
between
the
totally
abstract
and
the
first
words
that
are
attached
to
that
abstraction.
we
say
that's
not
where
the
statute
draws
the
line.
it
doesn't
say
idea
of
a
system--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
there
is
no
utility
in
copying
90
percent
of
the
menu
command
hierarchy
because
then
the
investment
of
the
user
in
a
skill
set
or
macros
wouldn't
work.
that's
the
reason
it
is
all
or
nothing,
and
that's
the
reason
that
there
is
the
starkness
in
the
case.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
that's
how
it's
used
in
the
patent
law,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
yes.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
well--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--right.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
i
think
that
the
copyright
law
stops
them,
and
the
principle
is
the
same.
i
mean,
to
tie
in
justice
ginsburg's
question,
all
the
other
circuits
have
also
held
that
when
it's
necessary
for
compatibility,
even
literal
code
may
be
copied.
so,
the
principle
is
one
of
how
much
economic
power
do
you
give
the
person
who
created
the
words.
in
the...
in...
with
respect
to,
say,
artistic
works
or
traditional
works
of
literature,
we
don't
give
the
person
through
copyright
enough
economic
power
to
prevent
the
creation
of
near
substitutes.
and
in
this
case
that's
exactly
the
amount
of
economic
power
that's
being
given.
that's
what
judge
boudin
says.
another
method
of
operation,
another
system,
a
different
set
of
words
is
not
a
near
substitute
to
users
who
have
invested
in
this
set
of
words.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
no,
but
that
would
be
a
good
standard.
[laughter]
but
i
don't
think
that
i
could
phrase
it
any
more
clearly
than
they
do
in
102(b).
since
people
invest
in
methods
of
operation
and
since
there
is
societal
utility
in
having
people
operate
efficient
systems
or
creating
efficient
systems
of
department
stores
or
jet
cockpits,
we're
only
going
to
put
efficient
systems
of
that
type
off
limits
to
competition
so
long
as
you
satisfy
the
high
threshold
of
utility
patent.
you
can
protect
it.
you
can
get
the
right
to
license
it.
you
can
have
all
those
rights,
but
you
must
satisfy
the
higher
threshold.
that
would
be
our
point.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
it
would
take--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--i
wouldn't
say
never,
but
the
barrier
of
entry--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--but
the
record
reflects
that.
that's
because
microsoft
was
able
to
make
a
compatible
product
because
lotus
didn't
sue
them.
lotus
didn't
sue
them.
they
had
the
same
words.
they
were
able
to
establish
compatibility,
and
that
changed
the
overall
concept
of
the
software
industry.
i'd
like
to
make
one
very
important
point
here.
it's
the
point
made
in
fogarty.
there
is
a
constitutional
limitation
here.
there
is
the
constitutional
limitation
of
the
patent
in
the
copyright
clause,
and
the
learning
of
this
court
from
fogarty
is
that
every
interpretation
we
make
of
the
copyright
statute
must
be
an
aid
of
the
public
benefit
requirement
of
the
constitution.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
not
in
this
case.
i
read...
we
read
the
statute
as
saying
that
with
respect
to
the
things
in
102(b),
congress
has
decided
that
the
protection
of
those
things
through
the
regime
of
indiscriminate
grants
of
private
monopoly
puts
too
much
off
limits.
congress
has
made
that
decision.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
if
we
can't
tell
whether
the
extension
of
copyright
in
the
particular
case
is
within
the
congressional
ambit
or
within
the
congressional
purpose
or
not,
we
shouldn't
take
that
step.
we
should
leave
it
to
congress.
i
think
that
that's
the
case
here.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
yes,
absolutely.
i
would
read
that
in--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--in
aiken
and
sony
and
fogarty.
but
i
would
go
so
far,
your...
mr.
chief
justice,
as
to
say
that
in
this
case
congress
has
made
that
decision.
they
made
it
in
102(b).
they
said
that
with
respect
to
the
things
in
102(b)
that
there
is
such
a
risk
of
overprotection,
of
overcompensation
to
the
first
author,
that
even
if
some
other
calculation
could
be
made
of
the
kind
that
justice
ginsburg
is
suggesting,
we
can't
go
that
far.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
oh,
yes,
and
i
would
not
read
that
as
what
he
is
saying,
and
we're
certainly
not
saying
that.
people
routinely
get
patents
over
menu
command
hierarchies.
ibm
has
done
it.
lotus
has
applied
for
it
in
europe.
the
claim
of
the
patent
covers
the
menu
command
hierarchy.
they
can
get
protection.
they
just
want
that
protection
without
going
through
examination,
without
showing
novelty
or
non-obviousness.
they
want
the
same
degree
or
virtually
the
same
degree
of
protection--
mr.
gary
l.
reback
--that's
correct.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
right.
that's
reflective
of
the
fact
that
we
should
not
put
off
limits
to
competition
certain
kinds
of
things
unless
people
satisfy
those
exacting
requirements.
mr.
gary
l.
reback
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
