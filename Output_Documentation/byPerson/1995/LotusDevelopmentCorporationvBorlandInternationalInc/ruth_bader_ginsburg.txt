mr.
gutman,
may
i
ask
you
one
thing
that
i
think
was
very
much
on
judge
boudin's
mind?
you
have
just
explained
that
(b)
doesn't
exempt
wholesale
anything
you
could
call
a
method
of
operation.
sure,
it's
a
method
of
operation
but
it
has
expression,
and
you
have
to
separate
the
expression
out
just
like
you
do
with
an
idea,
with
a
procedure,
anything
else.
they're
all
binary
in
that
respect.
but
judge
boudin
said
the
user
has
put
in
a
lot
of
the
user's
own
sweat
or
whatever
to
develop
something
new,
and
that
something
is
in
the
form
of
all
these
macros.
and
those
macros
were
not
created
by
lotus
1-2-3.
it
was
the
user,
working
with
this
machine,
to
get
up...
to
customize
a
whole
set
of
things
for
the
user's
own
operation.
the
user
can't
extract
that,
the
user's
own
work,
unless
the
user
can
resort
to
the
lotus
commands.
so,
i
noticed
something
in
your
reply
brief.
you
said,
of
course,
for
the
user
this
would
be
a
fair
use.
there
would
be
no
infringement
for
the
user.
so,
can
one
look
at
this
and
say
what
borland
is
doing
is
facilitating
the
user's
fair
use?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
my
question.
is...
can
the
user...
how
can
the
user
with
all
these
macros
make
use
of
them
with
the
borland
spreadsheet?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
something
about
the
key
reader?
do
i...
one
of
the
briefs
suggested
that
just
providing
the
key
reader
wouldn't
be
enough
because
all
you
could
do
with
the
key
reader
was
run
your
macros
as
is,
that
in
order
to
modify
them,
you
would
have
to
have
access
to
all
the
commands.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
computer
languages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
fortran
or
basic?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
reback,
wouldn't
that
change
the
character
and
understanding
of
102(b)?
i
mean,
all
these
categories
come
together
and
the
idea/expression
dichotomy
is
so
basic
to
copyright,
i
thought
it
was
assumed
that
every
one
of
these...
process,
system,
method
of
operation...
that
you
have
to
extract
out
of
them
what
is
the
expression,
the
separable
expression.
and
sometimes
there's
nothing
left
except
stop
and
go
and
sometimes
there's
a
merger,
but
that
you
can't
just
say,
oh,
method
of
operation.
forget
it.
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
expression.
that
seems
to
me
a
wholly
different
way
of
looking
at
102(b)
than
runs
through
all
of
copyright.
there's
always
the
question,
is
there
separable
expression?
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
that
leads
one
way.
but
just
to
say
this
fits
within
the
description
method
of
operation,
period,
we
can
take
it
out
wholesale,
is
something
that
i
have
not
seen
in
anything
other
than
this
first
circuit
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
in
baker
v.
selden,
there
was
something
there
that
was
protected.
there
was
the
book.
there
was
the
explanation
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
circuit
decision
does,
but
i
don't
see
that
in
the
statute,
especially
if
you
read
these
words
to
be
subject
to
the
like
interpretation,
idea/expression,
procedure/expression,
process/expression.
that's
what...
as
far
as
i
know,
the
first
circuit
is
the
only
one
that
has
said
once
you
can
call
it
a
method
of
operation,
it's
out
entirely.
forget
about
anything
else.
it's
a
method
of
operation,
period.
it's
not
copyrightable.
tell
me
about
an
operating
system.
the
basic--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
that
subject
to
copyright?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
take
the
macros
out
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
the
first
circuit
is...
still
comes
out
where
it
is.
it
doesn't
matter.
judge
boudin
focused
on
that
but
the
first
circuit
didn't.
the
first
circuit...
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
if
no
user
ever
made
a
macro.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
added
in
the
macros
to
add
weight
to
a
conclusion
that
they
had
already
reached.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
maybe
that's
why
judge
boudin
said
applying
copyright
law
to
computer
programs
is
like
assembling
a
jigsaw
puzzle
whose
pieces
do
not
quite
fit.
but
still,
to
say
we're
going
to
take
something
like
method
of
operation
and
give
it
a
kind
of
meaning
that
it
doesn't
have
in
other
contexts--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
almost--
--i
think
you
can
in
view
of
what's
happened.
right?
because
lotus
1-2-3
is
no
longer
the
front
runner.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
kind
of
calculation
at
all.
what
i
was
suggesting
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
statute
and
you've
been
featuring
judge
boudin
who
at
the
end
says,
some
solutions,
e.g.,
a
very
short
copyright
period
for
menus.
so,
that
makes
me
wonder
what
is
he
doing.
menus
maybe
are
protected
too
much
and
maybe
they
shouldn't
be
protected
for
as
long.
so,
he's
really
struggling
with
this
idea.
but
the
notion
that
because
there
may
be
too
much
protection,
the
court
should
then
revise
the
statute
is
troubling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
to
get
a
copyright
you
need
minimal
creativity.
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
don't
you
need
a
lot
more
originality
for
a
patent?
novelty.
novelty
for
a
patent.
