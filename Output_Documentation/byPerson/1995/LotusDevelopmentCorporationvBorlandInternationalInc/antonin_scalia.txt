justice
antonin
scalia
good
point.
[laughter]
but
the
contu
report
was
made
to
congress,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
any
word
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
any
word
at
all
to
enable
the
user
to
operate
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
have
an
instruction
manual
that
says
to
do
this
thing,
move
the
cursor
three
spaces
over
to
the
right
and
hit
enter.
you
don't
need
a
word
that
shows
you
on
the
screen
when
you
move
it
three
spaces
over
to
the
right
that
it's
on
file
and
when
you
hit
enter,
you
get
into
file.
you
don't
need
any
words
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
how
can
you
say
that
the
words
are
inseparable
from
the
operation
when
you
don't
even
need
them?
you
could
simply
have
a
written
users
manual.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
a
users
manual
as
far
as
that
goes.
you
can't
use
the
system
without
a
users
manual.
does
that
merge
with
the
system
itself
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reback,
as
i
understand
it,
your
opponent
is
not
insisting
that
you
cease
from
using
the
same...
what
were
you
contrasting
with
composition?
what
is
the
opposite
of
composition?
justice
antonin
scalia
system
or
method.
he's
not
insisting
that
you
abandon
his
system
or
method.
you
can...
you
could
have
the
same
thing
three
times
over
with
the
cursor
to
the
right
and
then
hit
enter,
and
you
can
set
it
up
exactly
the
same
way
so
long
as
you
don't
use
the
same
words
that
he
chose
to
use
in
his
description
of
it
on
the
screen.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
use
the
very
same
program
or
method.
he's
not
stopping
you
from
using
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
just
doesn't
want
you
to
use
the
same
description
of
it
that
he
adopted.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
saying
that
in
an
instruction
manual.
