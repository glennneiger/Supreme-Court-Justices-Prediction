chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
94-2003,
lotus
development
corporation
v.
borland
international.
mr.
gutman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
first
circuit
also
found
it
was
a
method
of
operation
and
therefore
not
patentable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
copyrightable,
yes.
we
had
a
patent
case
before
lunch.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gutman,
a
moment
ago
you
said
something
about
a
finding
of
infringement.
i
just
read
over
your
question
presented.
i
don't
see
that
it
presents
anything
about
any
question
of
infringement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gutman.
mr.
reback,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
congress
was
of
this
view
that
was
expressed
by
judge
boudin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
shows
a
narrowing
certainly,
but
i
would
not
think
just
the
one
citation
you
make
means
that
congress
adopted
the
view
the
judge
boudin
expressed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
exactly
is
the
difference
between
composition
and
method,
as
you
see?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
we
could
throw
out
some
part
of
congress'
act
by
saying
that
it
wasn't
an
aid
of
the
constitutional
grant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that?
some
sort
of
a
tie
counts
for
the
runner
approach?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
do
you
find
that
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reback.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gutman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
94-2003,
lotus
development
corporation
versus
borland
international.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
