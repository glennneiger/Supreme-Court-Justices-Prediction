but
assuming...
i
assume
the
469
words
are
in
english
and
they
each
express
something,
but
i
take
it
that
the
genius
of
what
lotus
did
was
to
work
out
ways
of
organizing
and
presenting
in
a
certain
order
possible
functions
of
a
computer,
possible
functions
of
certain
programs.
let's
put
file
first
and
follow
it
with
edit,
and
that's
a
lot
of
work.
they
did
that.
copyright
doesn't
protect
the
ingenious
system
they
worked
out,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
last
thing
copyright
has
in
mind.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that's
so,
the
question
then
comes
down
to
whether
one
can
easily
or
reasonably
easily
use
their
system,
unless
something
else
protects
it,
without
using
their
words.
and
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
baker
v.
selden,
isn't
that
the
issue
in
the
case,
or
is
it?
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
discuss
in
general
that
kind
of
an
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
the
system
is
calling
up
certain
kinds
of
commands
in
a
certain
order.
you
could
use
a
different
word.
you
don't
have
to
say
file,
but
it's
the
most
natural
word
to
use
or
it
is
a
natural
word
to
use.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
an
argument
about
that.
what
i'm
trying
to
work
out
is...
the
analogy
that
i've
been
using,
which
no
one
likes,
is
i
could
invent
a
system
for
organizing
a
department
store:
first
floor,
women's;
second
floor,
men's;
third
floor,
boys.
within
the
department
store,
floors,
pants
here,
trousers
there,
shirts
there.
within
the
shirts,
dress,
not
dress,
et
cetera.
and
i
could
have
little
signs
over
each
one.
the
genius
is
in
my
system,
not
the
words
on
the
sign,
and
you
have
the
right
under
the
copyright
law
to
tie
up
the
system
by
copyrighting
the
words
gentlemen,
ladies,
and
saying,
oh,
you
could
use
caballeros,
you
could
use
damas,
you
could
use
monsieur.
i
mean,
you
see?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
exactly
the
same
order
and
in
exactly
the
same
format.
i
mean,
the
genius
of
this
was
not
just
that
you
could...
you
had
a
system
of
access.
it
was
which
words
came
first,
what
order
they're
presented
in.
is
that
what
borland
was
able
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
could
that
system
work
in
order
to
attract
to
its
use
those
people
who
had
already
learned
lotus?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
it
the
purpose
of
copyright
law
to
throw
up
that
kind
of
obstacle
to
the
use
not
of
some
expressions,
but
to
the
use
of
a
person
who
invented
a
different
system?
that's
what
i'm
continuously
worried
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
something
in
copyright
law
that
stops
you
from
copying
a
concise
thing.
if
the
only
way
to
practice
mr.
selden's
art
is
to
copy
the
concise
words
at
the
head
of
a
column,
you
can't
do
it.
and
now
you're
going
to
come
back
and
tell
me
but
it
isn't
absolutely
necessary
to
use
those
same
words.
and
then
the
question
is,
how
much
do
we
read
into
that
word
absolute?
i
mean,
if
it's
possible
to
find
another
word
somewhere,
is
that
sufficient?
how...
what's...
that's
what
i'm
struggling
for,
the
test
of
how
far
baker
v.
selden
reaches.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
a
pictorial,
graphic,
or
sculptural
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
it's
not
the
words
in
the
pocket.
it
comes
up
on
a
screen.
it
comes
up
on
a
screen
in
a
certain
order
and
it's
designed
people...
for
people
with
a
mouse
in
fact
as
to
where
physically
they
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
is
the
word
asia
on
a
map
make
the
map
a
literary
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
the
question.
you
have
469
words.
they're
in
a
certain
order.
commands
i
guess.
right.
there
are...
yes,
the
commands.
and
they're
english
words,
and
if
they
were
in
a
book,
i
guess
they'd
certainly
be
copyrightable
and
you'd
give
them
what
feist
calls
thin
protection.
but
they're
not.
they're
on
a
screen.
so,
you
say,
okay,
baker
v.
selden.
it's
like
mr.
selden's
accounting
system.
and
everyone,
even
your
opponents,
agree
that
that
would
be
so
if,
in
order
to
work
the
system
of
organization,
you
had
to
use
these
469
words.
but
they
say
judge
keeton
found
you
don't
have
to
use
these
469
words.
you
could
use
some
other
words,
so
you
don't
have
to
tie
up
that
expression
in
order
to
use
mr.
lotus'
brilliant
system
of
organization.
and
now,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i've
got
that
point,
but
there...
that's
complicated
because
it's
the
success
of
their
system
that
created
that
obstacle.
is
there
any
other
point?
that
is,
is
baker
v.
selden
tied
to
the
words?
you
necessarily
have
to
use
this
expression
to
get
the
accounting
system?
or
do
we
go
beyond
necessarily?
and
there
are
certainly
themes
in
copyright
law
that
suggest
that
you
go
beyond
it
in
order
to
avoid
tying
up
a
utilitarian
idea,
but
what's
the
particular
point?
how
would
you
phrase
the
test
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
if
they
could
get
the
exact
system
and
simply
use
any
one
of
5,000
other
words
to
operate
it
exactly
as
well,
you
could
not
protect
that
expression?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
wait.
it's
not
method
of...
i
have
an
airplane
cockpit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
469
levers
on
it,
and
each
one
i
put
a
label
on.
those
are
words.
okay?
i
have
a
department
store
with
469
departments
organized
in
a
particular
way,
and
each
label
has
a...
each
department
has
a
sign
over
it.
each
of
those
signs
and
each
of
those
labels
has
a
word
in
english.
the
order
in
which
they
are
pasted
up
there
is
terribly
important.
now,
what
is
it
in
the
law
of
copyright
that
stops
me
from
copyrighting
those
469
words
in
the
order
they
are
on
the
labels
in
the
cockpit
or
in
the
departments
of
the
department
store?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
doctrine?
how
do
you
phrase
it
in
english?
i
have
a
strong
instinct
from
reading
your
briefs
i
guess
and
also
the
other
side
disagrees
nonstop
that
there
may
be
such
a
principle.
but
what
is
it
if
there
is
such
a
principle?
i
don't
think
it's
the
word
method
of
operation.
i
don't
think
it's
baker
v.
selden
literally.
i
can
find
theme
after
theme
that
tells
us
that
the
copyright
law
is
not
to
be
used
so
that
one
company
will
monopolize
the
internet
henceforth
into
world
reality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
think
possibly
that
could
be
for
congress.
but...
so,
what...
if
it's
the
copyright
law
that's
supposed
to
prevent
that
from
happening,
how
does
the
copyright
law
stop
them
from
getting
the
copyright
on
the
469
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
music
is
not
a
work
of
commercial
utility.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
isn't?
isn't
there
a
difference
in
copyright
fundamental
between
whether
a
work
is
a
work
of
commercial
utility?
does
your
case
depend
on
that,
there
not
being?
