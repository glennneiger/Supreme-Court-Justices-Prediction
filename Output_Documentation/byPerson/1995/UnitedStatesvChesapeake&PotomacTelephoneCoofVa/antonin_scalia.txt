mr.
wallace,
if
we're
going
to
get
into
history,
wasn't
it
proposed
to
congress
and
rejected
early
in
the
history
of
cable
to
prevent
cable
from
becoming
a
monopoly
by
making
the
cable
owners
common
carriers
only
and
preventing
them
from
programming,
which
would
have
made
cable
much
more
open
to
any
kind
of
programming
not
within
the
control
of
a
single
monopolist?
that
was
rejected,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
cable
monopolies
in
99
percent
of
localities
now,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
government
is
concerned
about
monopoly
power,
having
created
this
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
that
be
cross-subsidized?
can
you
tell
me
that,
mr.
wallace?
give
me
an
example
of
the
cross-subsidy
that
might
occur.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
you
know,
what
costs
would
be
shifted
over
to
the
monopoly
thing
very
readily--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that
the
regulator
wouldn't
be
able
to
spot?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
you've
said
that.
give
me
an
example,
a
real
life...
you
know,
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
this
doesn't
happen
with
the
cable
companies,
who
are
also
rate-regulated?
justice
antonin
scalia
into
programming?
hasn't
the
government
not
only
not
prohibited
them
from
originating
programming,
but
required
them
to
originate
programming?
is
there
no
risk
of
cross-subsidy
there,
and
was
the
government
totally
unconcerned
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
been
very
unconcerned
with
all
sorts
of
risks
in
this
whole
area,
and
suddenly
it's
picked
out
this
one.
i'm
just
telling
you
i
don't
understand
the
argument.
i
don't
understand
how
it's
supposed
to
work.
the
telephone
company
charges
me
or
you
let's
say
$50,
just
like
district
cable,
okay?
now,
if
it
can
in
fact
really
charge
an
additional
$5
on
my
telephone
bill
because
it's
somehow
hidden,
the
regulator
doesn't
understand
that
this
optic
fiber
which
is
necessary
for
the
cablevision
part
isn't
really
necessary
for
the
telephone
part,
but
you
fool
them,
so
they
could
get
$50
from
me
for
the
cable,
and
they
push
$5
on
my
telephone
bill.
my
question
is,
if
they're
so
smart
and
can
do
that
and
fool
everybody,
why
don't
they
do
it,
and
if,
in
fact,
they
do
do
it,
what
is
being
in
the
programming
editing
part
got
to
do
with
it?
professor
owen
says
that,
well,
if
they
go
into
the
programming
editing
part
they'll
have
greater
incentive
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
good
cause
including
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
no
longer
needed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
good
cause,
essentially?
isn't
that
part
of
your
analysis?
you
know,
things
have
changed
so
much
that
this
statute
really
is
not
necessary
any
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
therefore
we
give
you
a
good
cause
exception
to
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
interesting
concept.
does
the
opposite
work?
can
a
statute
that's
unconstitutional
at
the
outset
be
rendered
constitutional
over
time?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
things
change.
i
mean,
if
it's
a
facial
challenge,
as
i
understand
it,
there
has
to
be
no
situation
to
which
it
can
be
applied.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
can
say
there
could
be
a
situation
if,
you
know,
everything
went
back
to
the
way
it
was,
that
would
be
a
situation
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever.
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
why
there's
a
stock
market.
things
go
up
and
things
go
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
well,
i'm
willing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
when
it
was
initially
enacted.
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you're
willing
to
defend
that
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
interesting.
so
things
change,
and
it
becomes
facially
invalid.
what
if
they
change
again,
does
it
become
facially
valid
again,
or
does
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--congress
has
to
repeal
it,
or
it's
sort
of
a...
i
don't
know,
a
time
bomb
there.
you
wait
for
circumstances
to
reawaken
it,
sort
of
like
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
snow
white
statute.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it's
a
spring
in
use.
it's
a
spring
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
if--
--this
would
be
okay,
or
at
least
it
would
be
a
lot
closer
to
okay
if
the
ban
were
just
absolutely
on
telephone
companies
carrying
video
material.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
the
purpose
of
the
content-based
requirement,
or
a
higher
hurdle,
that
we
don't
want
the
government
to
be
imposing
its
biases
against
certain
contents,
against
certain
subject
matters,
upon
the
citizenry,
but
where
the
content-based
nature
is
really
based
upon
reference
to
a
third
party,
like
the
government
says
you
can't
produce
any
programming
that
he
produces,
the
government
doesn't
care
what
he
produces.
the
government
is
not
imposing
its
view
of
subject
matter
desirability.
it's
just
saying,
you
can't
compete
with
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
that
subject-based,
in
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,...
no,
no.
if
you
mentioned
monet,
yes,
but
anything...
monet's
still
alive,
or
it's
picasso
and
he's
still
in
one
of
his
earlier
periods,
so
you
don't
know
what
he's
going
to
turn
out
to
be
like.
you
just
say,
you
can't
paint
anything
that
competes
with
picasso.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
content-based?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
isn't
determining
the
content,
and
it
seems
to
me
here
the
government
is
essentially
saying
in
a
lot
of
words,
don't
compete
with
cable.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
they're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
care.
if
cable
chooses
to
produce
nothing
but
cartoons,
then
presumably
the
only
thing
at&t
would
be
kept
out
of
would
be
cartoons.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
those
who
also
assert
that
the
cable
industry
has
extensive
lobbying
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
he's
saying
that.
you
know,
i
was
worried
about
that,
too,
but
i
asked
the
question
whether
you
could
keep
the
phone
company
out
of
the
business
of
video
programming,
and
he
said
that's
a
totally
different
question.
that's
not
what
you've
done
here
if
you
say
you
have
to
be
a
common
carrier,
and
if
you're
a
common
carrier
you
cannot
do
any
video
programming,
any...
you
know,
you
can't
do
what
cable
does.
if
it
was
structural
like
that,
he
says
that's
a
different
case.
