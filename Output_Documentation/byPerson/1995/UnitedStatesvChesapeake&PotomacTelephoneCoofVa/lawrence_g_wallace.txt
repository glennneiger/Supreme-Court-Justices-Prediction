mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
provision
of
the
1984
cable
act
that
the
court
of
appeals
invalidated
in
this
case,
section
533(b)
of
title
47,
addresses
the
special
capacity
for
anticompetitive
conduct
by
local
telephone
companies
in
providing
cable
television
programming
services.
that
capacity
stems
from
the
telephone
companies'
established
situation
as
regulated
monopolies,
and
it
is
important
to
an
understanding
of
the
premises
on
which
the
commission
and
congress
have
acted
over
the
past
25
years
not
to
elide
too
quickly
over
what
it
has
meant
for
these
companies
to
be
regulated
monopolies.
they
have
in
the
first
place
been
given
exclusive
franchises.
the
virginia
statutory
provision
involved
in
this
case
is
set
forth
in
footnote
17
of
the
district
court's
opinion
on
page
77a
of
our
appendix
to
the
petition,
which
protected
them
against
competition
in
providing
the
telephone
services
regulated
on
the
basis
of
recovery
of
costs
and
return
of
capital
type
of
rate
regulation
still
the
predominant
and
historically
the
only
form
of
rate
regulation
to
which
they've
been
subject
in
providing
telephone
service.
they've
been
granted
rights
of
way
sometimes
with
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain
to
construct
poles
and
conduits
and
their
expenses
in
doing
so
have
been
included
as
part
of
their
rate
base,
so
at
the
advent
of
modern
cable
television,
when
it
was
replacing
the
old
community
antenna
systems,
they
had
not
only
the
capacity
to
provide
wire
service
throughout
the
communities
they
served,
they
had
the
wires
in
place
to
virtually
every
residence
and
a
capacity
through
their
government-sponsored
regulated
monopolies
to
stifle
the
development
of
any
other
competition
in
the
provision
of
cable
television
services.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
any
of
this
was
in
any
way
improper.
obviously,
this
served
an
important
public
interest
on
the
part
of
the
local
governments
in
assuring
that
telephone
service
would
be
available
throughout
their
communities
at
a
reasonable
cost.
but
the
situation
with
which
the
commission
and
congress
have
been
concerned
is
that
not
just
through
their
legitimate
use
of
the
advantage
that
they
had
were
they
in
a
position
to
stifle
the
development
of
others
in
providing
these
services,
but
they
also
would
have
the
capacity
incentive
to
use
unfair
competitive
methods.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
have
been
franchises
granted
to
the
cable
companies.
we're
talking
about
an
historical
evolution
of
a
provision--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
not
only
do
not
deny
it,
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
deny
it,
because
it's
part
of
the
basis
of
the
commission's
third
report
and
order,
which
has
been
issued--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--what
i
have
said
is
more
of
a
historical
nature
in
showing
the
development
of
regulation
in
this
field,
and
why
the
1984
act
with
its
provision
for
good
cause
waivers,
that
was
intended
to
have
flexibility
so
that
the
commission
could
adapt
it
to
changing
situations
in
the
industry
and
changing
technologies,
was
a
legitimate
response
to
the
congressional
concerns,
which
were
to
try
to
nurture
a
multiplicity
of
voices
in
the
provision
of
these
services
and
to
prevent
unfair--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
was
a--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
commission
is
undertaking--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--right
now
to
try
to
do
something
constructive
about
this--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
were...
the
concern
at
the
outset
with
the
1970
commission
study
and
regulations
that
were
then
adopted
by
congress
was
that
the
telephone
companies
were
in
a
position
to
preempt
the
entry
of
any
other
players
into
this
at
all.
they
were
allowed
to
enter
into
this
business
but
not
in
their
own
service
areas
where
they
had
these
artificial
advantages
as
monopolists.
the
whole
idea
was
to
bring
other
players
in,
with
the
telephone
companies
among
those
standing
in
the
wings
as
potential
competitors.
we're
talking
about
a
longer
view
than...
the
idea
was,
the
motivating
animation
of
this
was
that
otherwise
no
one
else
would
ever
get
into
it,
or
there
was
a
great
danger
of
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
like
to
think
of
that
as
a
form
of
more
narrowly
tailoring
the
restraint
to
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
prohibit
the
conduct
where
there
would
be
the
greatest
incentive
as
an
economic
matter
for
the
telephone
companies
to
engage
in
unfair
competitive
practices,
including
discriminatory
self
preference
in
the
use
of
the
essential
facilities
of
the
poles
and
the
conduits
as
well
as
the
cross-subsidization
that
is
so
very--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--difficult
to
detect
and
monitor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they're
not
prohibited
from
being
in
programming
in
the
sense
of
making
a
movie
or
a
series
undertaking
through
investment
or
activities
in
places
where
these
things
are
made
to
make
them
for
marketing
to
others.
what--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's
marketing
programs
the
way
a
cable
television
company
does
that
is
the
prohibition,
putting
together
a
package
of
programs
mostly
prepared
by
others,
and
marketing
them
directly
to
their...
the
customers
in
their
own
service
area
that
is
the
prohibition,
and
that
is
where
the
big
profit
is
to
be
made
in
comparison
with
what
they
would
get
from
enabling
others
to
use
their
wires
to
transport
and
market
their
packages
of
programming.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
would
be
many--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
would
be
many
common
costs
and
cost
allocation
methods,
as
this
court
recognized--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--they
would
share
capital
equipment.
they
would
share
the
fiber
optic
cable
itself,
costs
of
research
and
development,
costs
of
administration
of
their
telephone
network,
including
the
programming
service,
personnel
costs,
costs
of
raising
capital--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--all
of
this
would
have
to
be
allocated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
but
they
are
rate-regulated
under
federal
law
now,
but
they
don't
have
the
problem
of
extending
a
regulated
monopoly
into
an
area
that
is
less
regulated--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
having
to
allocate--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there
may
be
some
risk
of
cross-subsidization
there,
but
the
government
doesn't
have
to
address
every
risk
throughout
the
spectrum
of
society
in
order
to
be
able
to
move
one
step
at
a
time
against
risks--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
they
undertake
additional
expenses
of
a
substantial
nature,
they
have
more
opportunity
to
shift
the
cost.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
producing
the
cecil
b.
demille
film.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i'm
talking
about
marketing
something
to
their
same
customers
over
their
telephone
wires
the
way
the
cable
television
market
did
to
their
customers,
and
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--why
they
don't
do
it
without
having
undertaken
that,
why
they
don't
hide
the
same
$5,
as
you
put
it,
of
expenses
is
because
they
don't
have
the
expenses
to
hide.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i've
mentioned
a
number
of
categories
of
common
costs
that
would
be
difficult
to
allocate,
and
our
case
doesn't
rest
entirely
on
cross-subsidization.
there
is
also
the
problem
of
discriminatory
self
preference
in
handling
the
facilities
being
used
for
their
own
benefit
as
well
as
for
the
benefit
of
others
who
are
competing
with
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--this
was
taking
a
long-term
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
you
first
had
to
establish
somebody
else--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--who
could
be
in
this
industry
with
the
phone
company
there.
then
you
evolved
into
the
two-wire
situation
where
there
were
actually
two
providers
of
wires
to
most
of
the
residents.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
developed
through
the
history
of
commission
regulation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
can't
point
to
anything
in
the
record
in
this
case,
but
we
have
a
long
record
of
commission
consideration
of
these
matters,
and
the
commission
has,
once
the
cable
companies
began
to
get
established,
they
began
to
look
to
their
wires
as
the
best
potential
competitors
to
provide
competing
local
telephone
service.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
defending
the
statute,
which
in
our
view
has
always
had
just
a
presumptive
bar
in
it
with
a
provision
for
good
cause
waiver
as
situations
changed
and
as
the
commission
would
find
the
waiver
to
be
consistent
with
the
procompetitive
purposes
of
the
statute,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it's
not
that
the
statute--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
commission--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
commission's
third
report
and
order,
recently
adopted,
does
not
leave
the
presumptive
bar
without
bite?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
has
interpreted
this,
and
we
think
very
defensibly
in
its
recent
report
and
order,
to
say
that
they
can
define
what
circumstances
will
warrant
a
waiver
and
still
require
the
particular
applicant
to
show
that
that
applicant
meets
those
circumstances.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
can't
say
that
one
occurs
to
me
off-hand,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
unique
in
administrative
practice
to
define
in
advance
what
showing
will
entitle
people
to
a
waiver
under
a
public
interest
standard
of
a
provision
that
otherwise
would
apply,
and
those
who
do
not
meet
those
circumstance
will
not
get
a
waiver.
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
recognize
there
is
first
amendment
jurisprudence
which
says
that
those
seeking
to
engage
in
expressive
activity
should
not
be
subjected
to
standardless
waivers.
in
this
case,
the
waiver
is
to
be
based
on
the
taking
account
of
the
purposes
of
the
presumptive
bar
itself,
and
those
purposes
were
stated
quite
clearly
in
the
original
house
report
as
to
prevent
the
development
of
local
media
monopolies,
and
to
encourage
a
diversity
of
ownership
of
communications
outlets.
those
are
legitimate
purposes
adverted
to
and...
with
approval
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
turner
broadcasting
case,
not
purposes
that
are
in
any
way
meant
to
suppress
speech.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
that
because
of
both
technological
changes
and
changes
in
the
nature
of
the
industry,
where
the
cable
companies
have
developed
from
a
fledgling
industry
to
one
well-established,
competition
can
now
be
made
a
reality
in
this
industry
by...
and
the
new
video
dial
tone
system
which
in
trial
runs
has
been
running
200
channels
and
can
easily
be
doubled
that
and
more
provides
opportunities
to
introduce
several
competitors.
and
part...
while
there
was
reluctance
in
the
initial
work
of
the
commission
on
dial
tone
to
permit
the
telephone
companies
to
go
beyond
being
carriers
for
programming
for
others,
they've
recognized
in
this
report
and
order
that
both
in
order
to
preserve
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
to
give
the
companies
an
incentive
to
make
the
heavy
investment
that
you
need
to
make
dial
tone,
video
dial
tone
a
reality,
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
participate,
but
not
to
the
exclusion
of
other
participants.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
except
there--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that's
not
the
only
bite,
or
even
the
most
important
bite
of
the
statute,
because
cable
is
well-established
in
most--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
most
parts
of
the
country.
the
important
bites
are
that
they
cannot
acquire
an
existing
cable
company.
they're
only
allowed
to
participate
through
video
dial
tone
as
a
competitor,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that's
only...
and
the
rest
of
the
bite
is
that
they
have
to
comply
with
the
regulations
that
the
commission
is
to
adopt
to
safeguard
against
cross-subsidization
and
discriminatory
self-preference
and
use
of
the
video
dial
tone
system
itself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
the
regulations--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
could...
it
could
prohibit
these
practices,
yes,
but
it
could
not
do
it
with
the
bite
that
the
prohibition
would
have
if
someone's
authority
to
engage
in
this
lucrative
business
depended
on
agreeing
to
abide
by
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--any
of
these
conditions
are
subject
to
judicial
review
in
themselves.
any
conditions,
any
requirements
that
the
commission
will
adopt
can
be
reviewed
in
the
courts.
it
isn't
as
if
the
commission
has
unreviewable
sway
over
these
companies,
and
there's
also
an
agreement
to
share
this
capacity
with
other
providers
of
service,
that
there
is
a
common
carrier
aspect
to
this.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
did
you
say
can
or
can't
avoid
it?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
avoid
it
entirely.
there's...
it's
very
difficult--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
waiver
allowing
entry
is
a
judgment
made.
it's
a
trade-off
judgment
often
made
by
regulators
and/or
by
congress,
or
the
commission
acting
pursuant
to
congressional
authority,
of
how
much
risk
is
to
be
accepted
in
order
to
accomplish
offsetting
public
benefits.
obviously,
there
would
be
less
risk
of
cross-subsidization,
virtually
no
risk
if
they
weren't
allowed
to
participate,
or
a
much
lessened
risk
at
the
very
least,
but
a
judgment
has
to
be
made
by
someone
as
an
industry
evolves
of
when
it
is
that
the
risk
that
remains
is
going
to
be
outweighed
by
offsetting
public
benefits.
that
traditionally
has
not
been
the
role
of
the
courts
in
our
system
to
make
that
calibration
and
decide
when
a
change
in
the
regulatory
regime
is
ripe
and
should
be
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
it
could
happen,
and
perhaps
we
were
approaching
that,
and
under
the
stimulus
of
the
litigation
that
has
been
brought,
the
commission
has
now
taken
initiatives
that
make
the
waiver
policy
as
applied
more
responsive
to
the
changes
that
have
occurred,
but
this
was
always
something
that
they
had
authority
to
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i'm
talking...
i
don't
mean
on
its
face,
and
we're
dealing
here
with
a
facial
challenge.
i
would
say
only
in
application,
a
statute...
and
perhaps
it
would
be
unconstitutional
only
as
applied
under
those
circumstances,
when
the
statute
was
constitutionally
valid.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it...
we
suggested
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
fourth
circuit
to
readdress
it
based
on
what
the
commission
has
now
done.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
yes,
the
court
did,
but
that
still
does
not
erase
the
fact
that
the
legal
landscape
has
been
changed,
and
that
under
the
third
report
and
order,
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
respondents
could
have
declared
victory,
although
they're
loath
to
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
think
of
it
as
a
moving
target.
we
think
of
it
as
admirably
trying
to
respond
to
the
admonition
that
when
fairly
possible
statutes
can
be...
should
be
construed
and,
i
think,
applied
to
avoid
serious
constitutional
questions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
time,
place,
and
manner
cases
in
this
court,
the
model
intermediate
scrutiny
cases
often
have
involved
direct
restraints
on
speech,
as
such
heffron
v.
krishna
consciousness,
ward
v.
rock
against
racism,
taxpayers
for
vincent
are
all
examples
of
that,
and
as
long
as
there
were
other
opportunities,
as
we
have
shown
here,
content-neutral
regulation
for
a
nonspeech
purpose,
they
met
intermediate
scrutiny.
now,
we're
not
talking
about
the
remote
future
when
we're
talking
about
video
dial
tone
with
the
capacity
to
carry
three,
four,
or
five
providers
and
not
just
the
telephone
company.
we
have
already
had
in
place
in
dekalb
county,
georgia,
in
fairfax
and
arlington
counties,
virginia,
model
trial
runs
of
it
in
which
there
have
been
about
200
channels
and
the
phone
company
was
restricted
to
50
percent
or
less
as
the
provider
of
programming,
the
others
having
to
be
leased
out,
and
a
more
permanent
one
is
to
begin
soon
in
dover,
new
jersey,
a
small
community,
where
all
of
the
programming
will
be
provided
by
others
than
the
telephone
company
because
the
regulations
are
not
yet
in
place
that
will
permit
the
telephone
company
to
participate.
what
is
really
at
stake
in
many
of
the
contentions
being
made
here
is
the
contention
that
the
phone
company
should
have
autonomy
over
all
its
lines
to
be
the
sole
user
or
to
control
who
can
use
it,
a
form
of
asking
for
what
solicitor
general
fried
used
to
call
lochnerizing
the
first
amendment--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
third
report
and
order
gives
them
the
right
to
participate
on
video
dial
tone,
precisely
what
it
was
that
the
fourth
circuit
posited
at
the
urging
of
respondents
as
the
less
restrictive
alternative
that
could
have
been
adopted
to
accomplish
the
government's
purposes,
and
yet
they're
resisting
the
fact
that
this
has
been
achieved
now
through
administrative
interpretation
and
application
of
the
waiver
provision--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because
they
say
they're
entitled
to
more.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
dealing--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--what
can
be
taken
away
subject
to
judicial
challenge,
and
we're
dealing
with
a
facial
attack
where
they
have
to
show
that
there
are
no
constitutionally
permissible
applications,
and
we
have
a
constitutionally
permissible
application
in
the
third
report
and
order.
