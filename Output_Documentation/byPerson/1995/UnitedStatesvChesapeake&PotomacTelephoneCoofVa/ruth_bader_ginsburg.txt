justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
but
i
think
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
it
would
help
me
if
you
would
clarify
what
the
government
is
defending
now
as
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
you
set
out
the
history
very
effectively,
but
i
take
it
that
the
government
is
no
longer
defending
as
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
a
total
prohibition,
which
is
the
principle
thing
that
the
statute
did,
or
are
you
defending
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
call
it
a--
--why?
why?
--presumptive
bar,
but
this
waiver
provision
refers
to,
justified
by
the
particular
circumstances
demonstrated
by
the
petitioner.
that
doesn't
read
to
me
like
a
basis
for
the
commission
to
have
a
general
waiver.
we
waive
for
everybody
provided
they
meet
these
regulations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
another
instance
where
a
waiver
provision
in
a
statute
is
interpreted
to
mean,
going
in
you
have
a
waiver
if
you
meet
these
requirements,
instead
of,
here's
my
particular
situation,
i
would
like
a
waiver
because
of
something
peculiar
to
my
situation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
may
i
just
ask
one
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
had
a
regime
where
the
fcc
said,
fine,
you
can
do
all
this,
but
we
want
you
to
disclose...
we're
going
to
have
good
accounting
rules,
and
we
want
you
to
disclose
fully,
and
could
the
answer
be,
well,
the
disclosure
is
related
to
our
speech,
so
we're
not
subject
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
a
lot
of
economic
regulation
that
can
affect
the
press.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
some--
--but
it
hasn't
passed.
yes.
it
hasn't
passed.
there's
been
no
legislation
passed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
i
did
have
one
question--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--about
this
standard,
and
it's
a
concern
to
me
that
you
are
arguing
vigorously
for
the
top
standard,
the
strictest
scrutiny,
this
is
content-based.
suppose
the
government
said,
we're
going
to
let
you
video,
get
into
the
game,
anything
you
want
to
do
except
you
may
not
have...
you
may
not
video
anything
about
family
planning.
now--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--wouldn't
you
want
to
reserve
something
higher?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
would
we
have
to
have
super
strict--
