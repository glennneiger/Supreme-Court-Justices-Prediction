justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
does
that
work?
that
is,
the
thing
i
couldn't...
the...
in
trying
to
understand
this,
the
point
that
you
seem
to
be
making
now,
which
was
the
point
that
i
thought
was
the
strongest
for
your
side,
was
contained
in
professor
owen's
reply
affidavit,
where
i
think
he
agreed
with
professor
kahn
that
really
this
problem
of
cross-subsidy,
which
seems
to
me
your
only
rationale,
doesn't
really
exist
in
respect
to
cross-subsidizing
programming.
i.e.,
the
programming,
you
can't
easily
hide
the
cost
of
programming
in
the
cost
of
your
telephone
service.
i
mean,
it's
not
very
likely
a
regulator
would
think,
right,
the
cost
of
producing
cecil
b.
demille's
the
ten
commandments
was
part
of
the
cost
of
picking
up
the
phone.
they're
pretty
easily
separable.
it's
the
communication
part.
then
he
says,
but
they
wouldn't
have
the
incentive
to
do
it,
to
do
this
cross-subsidy
on
communication,
unless
they're
allowed
to
go
into
programming,
and
then
he
stops,
and
that's
the
part
i
didn't
understand.
that
is,
why?
why?
what
do
you
mean,
the
incentive?
why
is
there...
if
you
could
make
extra
money
by
doing
the
cross-subsidizing
of
the
two
kinds
of
communication,
why
wouldn't
you
do
it,
irrespective
of
whether
you're
in
programming?
what
does
programming
add
to
the
incentive?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
$5
is
$5.
if
they
can
fool
me
now,
they'll
fool
me
then.
what
has
the
editing
part
got
to
do
with
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean,
they're
going
to
hide
cecil
b.
demille's
ten
commandments,
which
is
their
editing
thing,
and
the
regulators
are
so
stupid
that
they're
going
to
think
that
that
programming
business
which
has
no
common
cost
is
really
part
of
your
telephone
service?
that
would
be
pretty
stupid
regulating.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
editing.
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
you're
making
a
common
cost
argument,
and
the
problem
with
your
common
cost
argument
is
all
the
affidavits
in
this,
i
think,
even
professor
owen
i
think
in
the
reply,
concedes
that
kahn
is
right
that
there
aren't
common
costs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
an
argument
that
basically
says
we,
congress,
would
prefer
to
have
a
monopolist,
the
cable
company,
exist
today
because
then
maybe,
if
the
telephone
company
runs
another
line
into
your
house,
it
will
let
three
or
four
people
use
that
line,
but
if,
in
fact,
we
don't
have
this
statute,
what
it
will
do
is
only
one
person
so
will
use
the
line,
namely
the
phone
company
itself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
find
anywhere
in
the
record
anybody
making
this
argument.
i
could
understand
this
argument,
but
i
didn't
under...
i
didn't
see
it
anywhere.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where...
is
there
somewhere
in
the
record
where
they're
making
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
if
the
congress
might
think
editing
is
a
very
important
function
in
the
future,
and
the
more
editors
the
better,
and
at
the
moment
we
have
one,
because
you
only
can
have
one
where
you
have
one
integrated
cable
and
editor.
there's
just
one,
the
cable
network,
and
you
say,
let's
have
two,
why
are
we
not
having
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
couldn't
congress
think,
look,
if
they
go
into
the
business,
at&t,
of
putting
that
line
in,
we've
got
another
line
here.
if
we
say
they
can
be
editors,
there'll
only
be
two.
if
we
say
they
can't
be
editors,
maybe
there
will
be
three,
four--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--five,
because
they'll
have
no
interest
in
not
turning
that
line
over
to
as
many
editors
as
want
to
come
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
bird
in
the
bush
is
worth
giving
up
the
bird
in
the
hand.
that
would
be
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
may
be
the
only
one
who's...
don't
spend
a
lot
of
time
answering
it,
but
i'm
nervous...
i
don't
fully
understand
the
standard
of
review.
that
is
to
say,
what
we
have
here
really
is
classical
economic
regulation,
and
it
happens
to
be
economic
regulation
in
an
area
where
people
are
providing,
like
newspapers
and
other
things,
they
are
providing
communication
services
which
does
involve...
but
is
suddenly
this
whole
big
economic
area
to
be
turned
over
to
courts?
because
we're
going
to
retreat
from
giving
congress
quite
a
lot
of
discretion
when
it
tries
to
deal
with
the
structure
of
industries,
and
we're
going
to
use
the
first
amendment...
other
people
in
history
have
used
other
amendments
to
sort
of
go
into
economic
regulation
in
great
depth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know
what
i'm
thinking
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
provision?
remembering
the
history
of
the
court,
and
the
use,
say,
of
freedom
of
contract
as
a
method
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--going
in.
all
right,
what
is
the
rule
when
you're
dealing
with
economic
regulation
in
the
communications
area
as
to
when
you
depart
from
the
normal
rational
basis,
lots
of
deference
to
congress?
when
do
you
do
it,
and
when
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
strict...
what
is
your...
i...
they
have
to
write
something
on
this
standard,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
one
question
on
the
standard
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
saying
strict
scrutiny,
but
if
you
applied
strict
scrutiny
to
this
thing,
then
wouldn't
you
have
had
to
say,
ab
initio...
you
know,
congress
made
a
bet
initially,
we
may
have
monopolists
here,
and
it
may
turn
into
at&t
western
electric,
and
we
don't
know
there
will
be
independent
cable
companies,
and
western
electric
and
at&t
is
a
legitimate
concern,
just
substitute
the
editor
of
cable
for
the
words
western
electric.
and
why
couldn't
congress
pass
a
statute
like
that
without
being
100
percent
certain,
just
80
or
60
percent
concerned
that
such
a
thing
would
happen?
