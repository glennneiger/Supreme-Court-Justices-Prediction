justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
it
boil
down
to
this,
mr.
wallace,
that
in
areas
in
nonrural
areas
where
there
is
present
cable
competition,
we
can
assume,
you're
suggesting
to
us,
that
the
commission
in
fact
will
allow
the
phone
companies
into
the
business.
where
there
is
no
competition,
we
can
assume,
i
take
it,
that
they
won't
allow
them
into
the
business.
is
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
bite
of
the
statute
is,
where
there's
no
competition,
the
statute
will
continue
to
be
applied,
and
where
there
is,
it
probably
won't
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
bite
is
going
to
be
the
justification,
you're
going
to
have
a
statute
extraordinarily
broader
than
anything
necessary
to
accomplish
that
particular
justification.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
those
regulations
could
be
promulgated
by
the
commission
whether
the
statute
stands
or
not,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
can't
the
commission
issue
regs
addressed
to
the
cross-subsidization
problem
whether
the
statute
stands
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
bite
is
kind
of
an
interrorum
bite.
in
other
words,
if
you
don't
agree
to
this,
under
the
statute
we
can
make
it
even
more
restrictive
for
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
tribe,
would
your
argument
be
different
if
congress
had
made
findings
at
the
time
it
passed
this
statute
and
the
findings
said,
in
substance,
this.
we
are
passing
the
statute
for
purposes...
for
an
economic
regulatory
purpose.
our
principal
concern
is,
in
fact,
with
cross-subsidization.
we
find
that
it
can
occur...
we
find
that
the
greatest
danger
of
its
occurrence
will
be
in
those
situations
in
which
the
cable
companies
are
engaging
in
the
editorial
function
as
you
have
designed
it.
we
find
that
that
danger
will
exist
primarily
only
in
those
instances
in
which
cable...
the
companies
are
engaging...
the
telephone
companies,
rather,
are
engaging
in
the
editorial
function
with
respect
to
the
same
kind
of
programming
that
is
going
on
over
cable
generally,
what
you
have
referred
to
as
the
video
program,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
adopt
this
reference
to
video
simply
as
an
effective
way
of
getting
to
the
heart
of
our
economic
objective.
would
your
argument
for
a
level
of
scrutiny
be
different
if
we
had
that
on
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
in
any
case
in
which
you
can
make
this
kind
of
facial
argument,
you
in
effect
are
saying,
we
are
precluded
from
the
consideration
that
sort
of
animated
justice
kennedy's
question
of
trying
to,
in
effect,
divide
the
universe
between
what
may
be
legitimate
economic
regulation
with
an
incidental
effect
and
the
rest
of
the
speech
regulatory
universe.
justice
souter,
i
think
it
would
be
salutary
in
terms
of
the
first
amendment
purposes
to
put...
to
remind
the
legislative
branch
that
it
may
not
abridge
speech.
it
may
not
use
speech
categories,
content
categories,
as
shorthand
for
other
things.
even
if
the
only
level
of
scrutiny
were
intermediate,
as
in
turner,
the
mere
existence
of
elaborate
findings,
which
certainly
the
1992
act
contained
and
this
act
does
not,
didn't
suddenly
mean
that
the
fire
power
of
the
first
amendment
receded.
this
court
looked
closely
at,
and
instructed
the
lower
court
on
remand
to
look
closely,
at
whether,
for
example,
the
finding
that
the
broadcast
industry
was
in
terrible
danger
and
would
be
driven
out
unless
this
must-carry
obligation
was
imposed,
was
in
fact
justifiable.
so
the
nub
of
your
argument
is
you
can't
use
speech
as
a
surrogate
for
other
regulatory
objectives
just
as
they
were
saying
yesterday
you
can't
use
race
as
a
surrogate
for
other--
