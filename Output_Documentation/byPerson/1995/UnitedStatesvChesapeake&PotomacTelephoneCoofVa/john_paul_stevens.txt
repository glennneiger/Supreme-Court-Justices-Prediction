justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
wallace?
is
it
your
view
that
appropriate
regulations
can
avoid
the
cross-subsidization
problem
that
allegedly
motivated
the
enactment
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
sort
of
in
a
dilemma,
i
suppose.
if
you
say
it
can
avoid
it,
then
we
don't
need
the
statute.
if
you
say
it
can't
avoid
it,
then
the
regulation...
you
have
all
sorts
of
problems
with
the
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
position
is
it
can
almost
avoid
it,
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
that
kind
of
runs
through
my
mind?
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
statute
was
perfectly
constitutional
and
was
enacted.
if
that
premise
is
accepted,
do
you
think
the
situation
could
change
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
thereafter
become
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
would
it
be
appropriate
for
us
to
examine
the
constitutionality
as
of
the
date
of
enactment,
and
then
just
ignore
all
this
subsequent
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--modify
the
question
to
this
extent.
suppose
the
justices
were
persuaded
that,
given
the
fact
situation
in
1984,
or
back
to
1970,
whatever
dates
you
use,
and
given
the
precedent
on
you
can't
have
cross-ownership
of
tv
stations
and
newspapers
and
things
like
that,
that
looking
at
it
at
that
time
it
should
have
been
upheld
if
there
had
been
immediate
challenge,
would
that
require
that
justices
reach
the
same
conclusion
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
there
can
be
a
moving
target.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
mr.
tribe--
--this
response
to
a
concern
that
i
had
as
well,
and
i
suppose
you
just
about
answered
it.
as
we
become
more
and
more
a
speech-intensive,
speech-creative,
speech-obsessed
society,
it
seems
to
me
we're
going
to
have
more
and
more
cases
where
you
tell
us
that
a
software
manufacturer,
or
the
manufacturer
of
a
video
screen,
is
engaged
in
speech,
and
i
have
to
say
that
although
you're
right,
this
is
directed
at
a
very
much
of
a
what
we
now
know
as
to
be
a
core
speech
activity,
the
government's
interest
here
primarily,
it
seems
to
me,
is
an
economic
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
this
raises
a
question
that
has
been
troubling
me.
supposes
that
congress
recognized
the
problem
you
describe
but
they
still
thought
the
concerns
that
motivated
the
statute
are
still
valid,
which
they
may
or
may
not
be,
and
they
enacted
a
statute
based
on
a
parallel
to
the
banking
regulation,
and
they
said,
we
don't
want
the
telephone
companies
to
take
undue
risks
with
their
capital
and
so
forth,
and
so
they
basically
said
telephone
companies
cannot
engage
in
any
business
except
what
they
do
now,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
suppose
the
national
government
decided
to
franchise
all
these
phone
companies,
they
could
do...
i
mean,
theoretically,
it
could
happen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
have
precisely
the
same
effect
on
the
first
amendment
interests
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
what
about--
--that
seems
to
me
to
suggest
it's
just
the
way
the
statute's
drafted.
in
other
words,
if,
instead
of
saying
provide
video
program,
they'd
said
to
transmit
video
program,
it
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
prohibition
against
transmission
would
really
be
broader
than
the
one
they
have
now.
wouldn't
that
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
accomplish
the
same
economic
objective
here,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
interrupt
for
a
second.
you
mean
you
have
to
subjectively
evaluate
a
transmission
to
determine
whether
it's
video
programming?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why...
why--
--but
you're
saying
that
if
you
did
define
it
by
using
the
number
of
megacycles
or
megahertz,
or
whatever
you
do,
to
define
the
kind
of
picture
that
you
normally
associated
with
a
television
program,
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
hard
to
explain
why
congress
doesn't
repeal
it,
then.
