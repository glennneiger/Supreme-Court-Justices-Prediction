we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-1893,
united
states,
the
federal
communications
commission
v.
chesapeake
&
potomac
telephone
company,
and
national
cable
television
v.
bell
atlantic
corporation.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
editing,
mr.
tribe.
you
don't
mean
the
actual
making
of
an
individual
show,
but
the
choice
between
ones
that
have
already
been
made.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
very
likely
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--bell
wants
to
go
out
to
hollywood
and
make
some
programs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
when
we
talk
about
statutes
of
general
applicability
like
associated
press--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
then
you
get
to
a
case
like
nccb,
that
certainly
was
not
a
statute
of
general
applicability.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
strictly
media
ownership.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that
the
court
there
applied
the
strict
scrutiny.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
nccb
was
just
kind
of
a
red
lion
extension.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
