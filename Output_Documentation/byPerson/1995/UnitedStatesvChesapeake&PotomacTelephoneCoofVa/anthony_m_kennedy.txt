it
seems
to
me,
mr.
wallace,
that
in
the
first
amendment
area,
where
i
think
this
case
is
taking
us,
a
standard
list,
or
very
amorphous
waiver
scheme,
is
quite
inconsistent
with
our
precedents.
i'm
thinking
of
the
police
commissioner
that
has
this
open-ended
discretion
to
allow
you
to
parade
or
not,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
sense
your
waiver
argument
almost
makes
your
case
weaker
from
a
first
amendment
standpoint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
the
thrust
and
the
purport
of
the
third
report
and
order?
does
it
specifically
contain
that
rationale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
you
saying
that
the
regulation
makes
the
case
moot?
if
their
case
was
valid
when
it
was
brought
before
the
fourth
circuit,
aren't
we
entitled
to
hear
it
based
on
the
assumptions
that
the
fourth
circuit
entertained?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
declined
that
invitation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
authority
justifying
this
agency
and
this
sort
of
moving
target
theory
of
litigation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
problem
is,
when
we're
talking
about
where
the
first
amendment
ends
and
economic
regulation
begins,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congress
at
some
point
could
say,
we're
interested
in
what's
happening
in
the
broadcast
cable
industry.
that's
what
we're
interested
in.
we're
not
interested
in
cement
companies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
we're
passing
an
economic
regulation
to
protect
consumers--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--from
prices,
or
whatever.
