mr.
wallace,
if
the
government
was
worried
that
telephone
companies
would
engage
in
unfair
practices,
why
is
it
that
the
statute
they
passed
just
prohibited
video
programming
instead
of
video
transmission?
i
mean,
it
just...
it's
just
so
illogical
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
did
they
select
the
most
speech-restrictive
approach,
instead
of
saying
we
won't
let
phone
companies
transmit
these
messages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean,
it's
more
narrowly
tailored
to
just
prohibit
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
tribe,
is
this
a
facial
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
have
to
look
at
it
for
its
validity
as
of
the
time
it
was
enacted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
tribe,
why
do
you
say
it's
not
content-neutral?
i
think
there's
some
room
for
debate
on
that
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
counsel,
what
can
be
granted
can
be
taken
away.
we're
dealing
with
an
absolute
ban
as
opposed
to
an
administrative
potential
for
waiver.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
