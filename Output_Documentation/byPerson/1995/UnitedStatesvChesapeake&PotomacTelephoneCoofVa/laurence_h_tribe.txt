mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
might
begin,
as
justice
thomas
did,
by
pointing
out
that
the
third
report
and
order
in
1995
fairly
negated
virtually
everything
that
mr.
wallace
has
suggested
about
why
perhaps
at
one
early
time
when
there
was
only
one
wire
into
every
home
something
like
this
might
have
made
sense.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
as
in
baker
v.
carr
there
are
a
few
things
that
with
changes
can
suddenly
become
wholly
irrational,
as
this
one
did,
but
i
think
even
if
you
try
to
turn
the
clock
back
to
1984,
this
law
would
have
completely
failed
to
fit
the
alleged
objective,
so
i
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
the
moving
target
question,
because
it
seems
to
me
this
law
has
always
been
facially
invalid,
and
facially
invalid
for
reasons
that
i
think
were
implicit
in
one
of
your
questions
to
mr.
wallace.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
i
think
that
would
be
inappropriate,
justice
stevens,
because
the
test
established
in
this
court's
decisions
in
coors,
edenfield,
and
turner
and
ibanez
basically
asks
does
the
law,
as
we
have
it,
materially
advance,
even
under
intermediate
scrutiny,
the
alleged
goal?
is
there
a
real
harm,
does
this
really
solve
it,
and
the
fact
that
at
one
time
there
might
have
been
a
problem
that
it
might
have
solved
would
be
interesting
history.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
and
there
is
none.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
a
meteorite
hit--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
mean,
my--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
but
it
is
our
position,
justice
scalia,
that
because
of
the
way
this
law
is
written
and
because
of
what
it
means,
there
really
are
no
circumstances
in
which
it
could
be
constitutional.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
that
relieves
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
i'm
willing
to
defend
that
position.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
makes
no
sense.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that
the
constitution
is
fixed.
i
think
that
the
question
whether
a
given
law
is
justifiable
necessarily
depends
on
the
circumstances,
and
the
circumstances
can
change
so
substantially
that
the
law
on
its
face
might
never,
in
current
circumstances,
have
any
permissible
application.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
since,
justice
scalia--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no...
like
a
sleeping
giant.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
like
the
night
of
the
walking
dead,
you
try
to
kill
the
statute
and
it
won't
rise.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
a
spring
in
use.
[laughter]
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
let
me...
i
think
to
get
away
from
the
question
whether
we
can
hypothesize
any
world
in
which
the
statute
could
have
a
constitutional
application,
it
would
be
useful
to
focus
on
what
the
statute
actually
does,
because
some
of
what
mr.
wallace
described
about
the
statute
when
he
said
that
it's
sort
of
about
ownership
and
so
forth
i
think
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
statute.
and
let
me
just
focus
on
the
fact
that,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
the
statue
as
designed
rather
perversely
targets
one
thing
and
one
thing
only,
and
that
is
speech.
it
is
not
a
law
against
cross-subsidization.
it
is
not
a
law
that
says,
for
example,
when
there
is
no
competition,
then
we
will
let
them
in,
because
(b)(3)
itself
is
an
exception
for
that.
that
is,
this
law
deals
directly
with
the
editing
function.
it's
true
the
prohibition
was
included
in
a
part
of
the
statute
called
ownership
restrictions,
but
there's
no
dispute
that
this
statute
allows
a
telephone
company
to
own
video
programs,
to
invest
in
companies
that
generate
or
require
them,
like
time-warner,
to
own
physical
cable
facilities
such
as
bell
atlantic
does
in
washington,
d.c.--
the
one
function
this
law
prohibits
any
telephone
company
from
participating
in
is
the
editorial
function
of
deciding
which
video
programming
channels
to
carry...
is
it
going
to
be
disney,
the
learning
channel,
discovery,
playboy
+/?
how
the
programs
are
going
to
be
arranged,
which
to
provide
in
preset
time
slots,
which
to
provide
on
demand.
that's
the
way
it's
been
interpreted.
that's
the
way
it's
been
enforced.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
although
it
would
certainly
prohibit...
i
mean,
if
we
wanted,
for
example,
not
only
to
choose
the
shows,
but
wanted
in
addition
to
engage
in
a
more
active
editorial
function,
that
would
also
be
prohibited
if
this
was
going
to
be
provided
directly
to
our
customers.
now,
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--not
likely,
no.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
would
never
predict,
but
that's
not
likely,
i
think.
the
point,
however,
is
that
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
the
preferred
opinion
recently,
in...
and
hurley
and
turner,
the
function
of
deciding
what
to
show
and
when
is
a
core
first
amendment
function,
and
in
saying
that
that
is
what
telephone
companies
cannot
provide
to
their
subscribers,
they
can
provide
video
transport,
they
can't
provide
the
editorial
function,
the
law
is
a
complete
misfire
in
terms
of
any
objective
it
could
ever
have
achieved
even
in
1970.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
sounds
good
to
me.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
you've
done
something--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
interest
in
somehow
preventing
any...
a
particular
set
of--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
point
i
guess
is,
first
of
all,
in
response
to
your
earlier
question,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
suggesting
that
congress
theorized
along
these
lines,
there
isn't.
but
secondly,
the
notion
that
by
keeping
a
competitor
like
the
telephone
companies
out
you
might
somehow
achieve
something
in
the
very
long
run
is
really
quite
irrational.
that
is,
the
second...
their
whole
theory
is
that
because
there
can
be
cross-subsidy
of
video
transport,
and
because
here
you've
got
a
captive
market,
the
ratepayers,
and
we
can
pad
the
bills
here
and
engage
in
predatory
pricing,
that
this
is
a
particularly
dangerous
editor,
somehow,
to
let
in.
but
in
response
to
your
question,
it's
always
puzzled
me
as
well.
how
exactly
does
it
work?
why
does
editing
somehow
change
it?
money
is
money.
if
they
can
monopolize
the
video
transport
they'd
be
doing
it
today.
ncta
in
its
briefs
points
out
that
they
have
unique
incentives
to
do
that
now
because
they
think
the
telephone
companies
are
afraid
of
the
cable
companies,
so
this
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
of
taking
a
particularly
powerful
speaker
and
gagging
him
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
engaging
in
predatory
abuses
that
will
in
the
long
run
stifle
diversity,
because
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
one
thing
that
speaker
could
do,
provide
video
transport
that
provides
the
alleged
source
of
danger.
they
in
their
briefs
at
various
points
say
that
it
serves
that
function
because
the
video
transport
market
is
regulated
in
price,
but
the
video...
but
the
cable
market
isn't,
and
so
you
want
to
go
into
an
unregulated
market,
but
of
course
that's
problematic,
because
it's
false.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
would--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
i
do,
justice
breyer.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly
the...
if
there
were
a
rule
of
general
applicability
like
the
one
in
lorain
journal
or
the
one
in
associated
press
v.
united
states,
and
it
incidentally,
somebody
argued,
restricted
expressive
opportunity,
we
would
not
be
arguing
here
for
some
version
of
strict
scrutiny,
although
even
under
the
o'brien
test
there's
intermediate
scrutiny.
rules
about
the
structure
of
an
industry,
about
who
may
own
what,
are
really
quite
different.
the
nccb
case
deals
with
that
in
the
case
of
broadcasters
and
newspapers.
this
isn't
even
a
rule
about
who
may
own
what.
it's
a
rule
about
who
may
edit.
it's
not
even,
as
in
turner,
a
must-carry
rule.
it's
a
may-not-edit
rule.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
the
most
important
thing,
justice
breyer,
is
to
ask
whether
something
is
simply
economic
regulation,
an
argument
that
the
government
made
below
but
has
abandoned,
or
whether
this
really
has
a
significant
enough
impact
on
speech
that
it
is
a
first
amendment
problem
in
a
genuine
sense.
in
this
case
we're
way
beyond
that.
we're
way
beyond
that
along
at
least
two
dimensions,
because
this
law
i
think
shouldn't
be
categorized
with
a
merely
economic
regulation
that
just
happens
to
touch
this
industry.
it
directly
takes
aim
at
a
core
speech
function
deciding
what
the
mix
of
information
shall
be
and
what's
available
over
important
medium.
it
doesn't
do
that
as
the
incidental
result
of
a
general
law
of
applicability,
a
law
about
camping
like
the
law
in
ccnv,
or
a
law
about
using
or
destroying
government
property,
like
the
laws
in
albertini.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
terms
of
its
original
motive.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly.
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
that
as
issues
of
speech,
intellectual
property
and
telecommunications
in
cases
this
court
will
hear...
lotus
v.
borland...
in
cases
the
court
has
already
heard,
turner,
and
in
this
case,
come
crashing
upon
the
judiciary,
it
will
be
important,
in
addition
to
worrying
about
where
we're
all
headed,
to
keep
our
eyes
gazed
on
rather
fixed
stars
of
this
constitutional
constellation.
one
of
them,
surely...
and
this
court,
i
guess
your
concurring
opinion
in
simon
&
schuster
made
it
clear,
has
helped
establish
it...
is
that
you
apply
strict
scrutiny
when
a
law
directly
and
demonstrably
aims
at
speech
and
only
speech
and
demonstrably
reduces
its
quantity,
even
if
it's
not
content-based.
buckley
v.
valeo
was
like
that.
fcc
v,
nccb
was
like
that,
meyer
v.
grant--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
i
think
the
state,
as
part
of
its
franchising
authority,
might
have
the
power
to
say
you,
a
corporation,
are
a
creature
of
the
state,
this
is
a
condition.
but
even
though
mr.
wallace
spoke
about
the
telephone
companies
as
though
somehow
they're
all
franchised,
and
he
almost
made
it
sound
as
though
they're
all
franchised
by
the
national
government
so
it
could
impose
this
condition,
it's
important--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
suppose
given
the
reach...
i
don't
know
how
far
lopez
will
end
up
going,
but
this
sounds
like
commerce,
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
the
government
says
as
a
precondition
of
going
into
a
particular
business,
you've
got
to
agree
to
stick
to
business,
you
can't
go
out
and
become
a
speaker
or
an
editor--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't
really
think
so.
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
i
think
political
incentives
would
be
very
different.
it's
very
much
easier
for
congress
to
pass
a
law
that
does
not
really
make
a
general
structural
proposition
but
says
there's
a
certain
function,
namely
editing
speech,
that
some
speakers
cannot
perform.
if
you
look
at
this
law,
not
only
does
it
take
aim
at
speech
and
nothing
but
speech,
and
in
that
sense
misfire
completely,
it
doesn't
hit
its
target,
but
it
is
in
fact
content-based.
it
seems--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's...
you're
certainly
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
and
it...
as
it
explained
in
turner,
the
reason
it
didn't
is
because
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
is
a
unique
and
scarce
resource,
and
problems
of
physical
interference
allow
the
national
government
to
license
it,
and
the
court
has
said
consistently
from
nccb
through
turner
that
the
standards
applicable
to
rules
that
say
who
may
and
who
may
not
hold
a
broadcast
license,
and
if
you
hold
a
broadcast
license
what
else
may
you
own,
do
not
apply
to
the
cable
industry
or
to
anybody
else.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
exactly.
exactly,
your
honor.
let
me
get
back
to
the
point
about
this
law
being
content-based,
because
i'm--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
i
doubt
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
mean,
i
think
disclosure
requirements
have
been
upheld
in
the
campaign
area,
which
is
a
core
speech
area,
and
in
the
riley
case,
even
though
i
think...
riley
v.
national
federation
of
the
blind,
even
though
i
think
maybe
justice
scalia
had
a
problem
with
some
of
the
disclosure
rules,
those
were
upheld.
all
kinds
of
rules
designed
to
protect
the
public
from
abuses,
trying
to
shift
costs
to
fool
regulators,
not
aimed
at
speech,
and
they're
content-neutral,
and
they
don't
demonstrably
restrict
the
amount
of
speech,
and
therefore
they're
not
subject
to
special
speech
scrutiny.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
incidentally
and
indirectly,
yes,
but
if
it
affects
the
press
indirectly
only,
it's
subject
to
intermediate
o'brien
scrutiny,
and
if
it's
part
of
a
law
of
general
applicability,
as
opposed
to
a
restriction
on
the
manner
of
speech,
then
i
think,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
barnes,
this
court
really
has
not
used
o'brien
to
strike
down
a
law
of
general
applicability
that
doesn't
take
aim
at
an
expressive
activity.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
we
think
of
this
as--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
as
you
said
in
the
turner
opinion,
justice
kennedy,
the
fact
that
the
industry
definition
happens
to
focus
on
an
aspect
of
the
media
doesn't
in
itself
trigger
strict
scrutiny,
and
we've
not
made
that
argument.
what
does
trigger
strict
scrutiny
here,
and
i
do
want
to
underscore
that
this
law
failed
any
level
of
scrutiny,
including
intermediate,
and
i
hope
to
get
back
to
it,
but
since
you're
talking
about
the
future
of
the
first
amendment,
i
think
an
important
principle
to
establish
would
be
that
just
calling
a
law
economic
regulation
doesn't
allow
you
to
fail
to
look
at
what
it
actually
says.
that
is,
this
law
says
telephone
companies
may
not
directly
provide,
in
the
sense
of
edit,
video
programming,
and
it
defines
video
programming
as
programming
generally
considered
comparable
to
that
provided
by
a
television
broadcast
station.
the
government
in
its
brief
says,
oh,
this
is
just
a
matter
of
mechanical
definition.
it's
a
matter
of
defining
the
mode,
the
method
by
which
a
message
is
disseminated.
that
is
not
true.
that
is
true
of
the
way
the
cable
act
that
this
court
reviewed
in
turner
defines
things
like
cable
service.
that's
not
true
of
this
definition.
indeed,
the
fcc
itself
in
its
video
dial
tone
order
made
very
clear
that
the
line
that
this
law
draws
between
the
video...
the
video
impulses
that
may
be
provided
by
the
telephone
companies
and
those
that
may
not
within
the
universe
of
cable
service
is
a
line
that,
for
example,
does
not
distinguish
between
one-way
and
two-way
transmissions,
interactive
television
shows,
two-way,
they
can't
provide
them--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
justice
souter.
my
principal
argument
would
be
that,
as
this
court
has
often
recognized,
it
is
dangerous
to
make
the
level
of
scrutiny
depend,
except
when
you
absolutely
have
to,
on
an
inquiry
into
why
congress
acted.
the
face
of
the
law
should
be
the
primary
test.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
certainly
you
can't
use
the
content
of
speech,
that
speech,
like
race,
like
religion,
is
a
matter
of
special
sensitivity,
and
that
content-based
rules
do
not
have
to
be
merely
a
mask
for
some
illicit
objective
on
the
part
of
congress
before
they
trigger
a
strict
scrutiny.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
carrying
any
video
signal
of
any
kind.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
would
certainly
be
less
invidious
in
terms
of
a
content
line
if
it
said
they
can't
carry
or
transport
signals
of
a
certain
megahertz
frequency,
just
defined
it
in
a
technical
way.
i
think
it
would
at
that
point
not
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny,
although
if
one
could
show,
as
i
think
is
plain
here,
that
they
are
foreclosing
an
important
medium
of
communication...
maybe
not
the
same
one
as
in
ladue,
putting
stuff
on
your
house,
but
the
most
important
medium
today
to
a
large
set
of
speakers...
it
would
certainly
not
be
appropriate
to
subject
it
to
the
reduced
level
of
scrutiny
that
some
merely
economic
regulations
get.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
we
might
have
a...
we
certainly
would
have
a
different
case,
but
the
way
the
statute
is...
you
say
just
the
way
the
statute
is
drafted.
a
lot
turns
on
a
word
here
or
there,
the
word
not,
the
word
speech.
this
statute
is
written
in
a
way
that
guarantees
it
will
misfire.
look
at
coors,
for
example.
one
could
have
said,
well,
there's
a
general
problem
with
people
drinking
it
up
too
much,
and
if
they
had
not
had
those
puzzling
exceptions
the
statute
might
have
been
okay,
and
certainly
alcohol
is
a
matter
of
social
concern.
but
no,
this
court
looked
closely,
said
that
these
exceptions
don't
make
sense,
the
law
doesn't
fit,
it
subjected
it
to
intermediate
scrutiny,
and
struck
it
down
because
of
just
the
way
it
was
written.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it's
sometimes
the
case
that
by
broadening
the
law,
by
eliminating
what
makes
it
content-based,
it
solves
the
problem.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
might...
no,
well,
there's
a
difference,
justice
stevens.
if,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
they
actually
prohibited
video
transport,
there
would
at
least
be
a
prayer
that
they
would
achieve
something.
this
law
has
no
such
hope.
it's
a
lot
like
justice
frankfurter
said
in
butler
v.
michigan,
when
he
was
dealing
with
a
very
broad
law
designed
to
keep
adults
from
reading
material...
children
from
reading
material,
and
then
they
said
the
adults
can't
see
it,
either.
he
said,
this
isn't
just
a
case
of...
i
guess
it
was
burning
the
house
to
roast
the
pig.
it's
a
case
where
the
pig
lives
somewhere
else
altogether.
[laughter]
that's
what's
going
on
here.
it's
not
just
that
they
are
overshooting
by
a
mile,
they're
shooting
at
the
wrong
target,
and
they're
choosing
speech
and
they're
defining
it
by
its
content,
and
i
couldn't
imagine
a--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
suppose,
justice
o'connor,
it
depends
on
what
one
means
by
content-neutral.
that
is,
one
could
have
said
that
the
line
in
discovery
network
between
newspapers
and
commercial
pamphlets
is
not
an
ideological
line,
and
so
it's
content-neutral,
but
the
court
said
no,
you
have
to
examine
the
content
to
tell
whether
the
law
applies.
so
that's
one
test.
i
think
when
you
suggested
in
ladue
how
important
it
is
to
have
a
bright
line
test
for
what
is
and
what
isn't
content-neutral,
i
think
one
bright
line
test
i
could
suggest
is,
if
you
can't
tell
whether
the
speech
is
prohibited
without
subjectively
evaluating
its
content,
then
it's
not
content-neutral.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
absolutely.
the
fcc
has
said
we
have
to
look
at
the
mix
of
textual
and
nontextual
material.
the
mere
inclusion
of
video
text,
even
though
that
makes
it
a
little
different
from
what
was
around
in
1984,
doesn't
prevent
it
from
being
video
programming.
they
said
that
interactive
two-way
television,
though
it
wasn't
available
in
1984,
that's
video
programming.
they
said
that
a
lot
of
one-way
stuff
like
stock
quote
transmission,
and
news
services,
even
with
pictures,
they're
not
video
programming.
they
don't
look
like
i
love
lucy.
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
could
be
more
manifestly
content-based.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
would
depend
on
what
law
it
was
part
of,
and...
but
that
would
not...
that
would
certainly
prevent
it
from
being
content-based.
this
law,
i
think,
fairly
speaking,
is
content-based,
but
in
any
event
it
is
a
direct
ban
on
speech.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
if
it
said
you
can't--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
it
said
you
can't
put
paintings
up
if
they
are
comparable
to
those
by
monet--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
that
would
be
content-based.
i
think
the
reason
is
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
that's
why
we
have--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
have...
i
think
the
real
answer
probably
is
intellectual
property
and
copyright.
that
is,
there
is
in
that
context
a
competing
constitutional
provision.
there
are
circumstances
in
which
people
can
be
given
property-like
interests
whose
contour
does
depend
on
content,
but
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
that's
true
with
respect
to
intellectual
property
means
that
the
government
should
generally
be
able
to
target
content.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
would--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
since
nothing
in
the
result
we
seek
depends
on
the
theory
one
adopts
for
what's
content-based,
or
even
strict
scrutiny,
i
hope--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
[laughter]
one
way--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
in
the
cable
act,
justice
breyer,
congress
did
very
much
that.
it
said,
look,
we've
got
this
monopolist.
it
then
defined
cable
service
in
a
neutral
way,
and
it
imposed
certain
obligations
that
didn't
reduce
the
amount
of
speech.
here,
instead,
whether
or
not
you
think
the
definition
is
content-based...
and
i
don't
know
that
you
need
to
write
an
opinion
about
that
because
it
so
obviously
flunks
intermediate
scrutiny.
that
is,
even
if
you
assume
for
a
moment
that
you
could
come
up
with
some
answer
to
your
question
about
how
it
is
that
they
have
more
incentive
to
cross-subsidize
as
a
result
of
this
law,
the
on-balance
judgment
made
by
all
of
the
expert
agencies
in
the
government
from
1987
to
1992
and
then
embodied
in
the
video
dial
tone
order,
is
that
this
is
massively
counterproductive
in
terms
of
the
competitive
objective.
i
mean,
the
conclusion,
i
think,
that
was
in
your
1987
article
tentatively,
they
adopted
it
and
went
full
fire
with
it.
they
said
that
it's
virtually
hallucinatory
to
think
that
the
telephone
companies
could
enter
this
market
with
massive
cable
incumbents,
win
market
power
through
this
scheme
of
predatory
pricing,
and
knock
out
those
huge
companies,
and
that
on
balance
the
law,
even
if
you
grant
that
regulators
are
so
stupid
that
they
would
miss
everything,
that
on
balance
the
law
is
responsible
for
this
massive
monopoly
we
now
have,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
that
the
law,
in
fact,
costs
consumers
billions
of
dollars
in
competitive
benefits.
now,
if
you
wanted
to
look
at
the
big
picture,
one
thing
you
surely
want
to
say
is
that
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
say
that,
because
speech
is
important
and
speech-related
industries
are
important,
we
are
entitled
to
have
a
law
sustained
that
on
the
undisputed
record
in
this
case
eliminates
something
like
99
percent
of
the
speech
that
telephone
companies
could
provide
in
video
programming
form,
allowed
to
have
it
sustained
on
the
basis
of
wild
speculations,
where
all
of
the
evidence,
unlike
florida
bar
where
there
was
this--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
they
did,
not
in
a
bill
that
the
president
has
yet
signed,
but
if
you're
going
to
look
at
post
enactment
history
this
past
summer,
by
huge
majorities,
both
the
house
and
the
senate
said,
of
course
this
is
counterproductive.
that
wasn't
even
one
of
the
serious
debates.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
no,
i
understand
that,
justice--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
wouldn't
imagine
how
that
could
be,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that,
of
course--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--something
higher.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
per
se
invalidity
i
would
want
to
reserve
for
that.
i
would
want
to
say
that
there
are
some
bans
on
speech
that
no
justification
could
sustain,
but
it's
only
an
accident
of
the
half-hour
i
think
that
a
lot
of
time
we
spent
on
content-based.
remember
the
fundamental
point,
this
law
doesn't
fit
at
all.
it's
not
only
not
narrowly
tailored,
it's
completely
untailored
to
any
legitimate
governmental
objective.
if
the
court
ruled,
as
it
did
in
edenfield
and
ibanez,
and
turner,
and
coors,
this
law
is
a
lot
worse
than
any
of
those.
it
is
positively
counterproductive,
and
this
third
report
and
order,
which
is
sort
of
like
gertrude
stein's
oakland...
i
mean,
you
look
at
it
and
there's
no
there
there...
it
doesn't
promise
anything.
it
just
says,
you
know,
now
that
we
have
this
case,
we
want
to
be
speech
friendly.
maybe
we'll
do
something
if
you
give
us
a
chance.
but
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
what
they
promised
to
do,
you
know,
makes
me
worry
a
little
bit,
because
it's
to
exercise
a
blank
check
authority
over
speech,
and
that's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
