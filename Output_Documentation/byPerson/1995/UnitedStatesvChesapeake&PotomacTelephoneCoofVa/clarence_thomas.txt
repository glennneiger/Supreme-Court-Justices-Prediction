--all
that
is
well
and
good,
but
to
date
has
that
changed,
and
are
cable
companies
competitive
with
each
other,
or
are
they
equally
in
the
monopoly
position,
and
are
we
just
talking
about
monopolists
versus
monopolists?

i
know
it,
but
the
evolution
has
taken
place.
the...
as
i
understand
it,
the
cable
industry
is
no
longer
at
its
infancy
state,
it
is
a
developed
industry
with
over
90
percent
saturation,
right?
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
doesn't
the
third
report,
the
basis
of
the
third
report
conflict
with
much
of
what
you've
just
said,
as
to
the
development
ability
of
the
cable
industry?
