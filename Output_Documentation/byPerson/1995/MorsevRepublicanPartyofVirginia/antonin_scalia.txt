ms.
karlan,
how
can
that
be?
can
i
not
follow
a
political
party
that...
say
a
feminist
group
wants
to
start
a
women's
political
party.
only
women
can
be
members.
anybody
in
the
world
can
vote
for
their
candidates,
but
it's
a
women's
party.
that's
not
permitted
under
this
legislation?
it's
action
by
the
state
simply
because
that
party
excludes
men
from
participating
in
the
political
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
their
selection
of
a
candidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it
was
successful.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
won
election,
and
thereupon
it
would
have
to
be,
i
suppose,
disbanded.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
held
political
parties
were
covered
in
those
cases
when
election
as
the
nominee
of
that
political
party
was
effectively
election
to
the
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
a
different
situation
from
what
one
has
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
karlan,
you
say
that
this
would
not
have
been...
it
would
have
been
a
dead
letter
if
it
couldn't
have
been
applied
against
the
democratic
party
in
the
south
in
the
era
when
it
was
enacted.
how
many
times
was
it
applied
against
the
democratic
party
in
the
south?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
recent
is
that
dozen?
justice
antonin
scalia
1982,
a
good
deal
after
the
south
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
situation
that
you
described.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
12.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
wouldn't
a
political
subdivision
still
be
a
state?
wouldn't
it
still
be
state
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bender,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
preferred
position?
suppose
a
state
just
says,
every
party
that
in
the
last
election
got
1
percent
or
more
of
the
vote
is
entitled
automatically
to
be
listed
on
the
ballot
in
the
next
election?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
gives
the
government
the
right
to
require
that
party
to
submit
to
the
government
for
its
approval
any
change
in
the
process
by
which
that
party
selects
its
candidates?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
close
to
the
political
process,
but
it's
also
very
close
to
freedom
of
association.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ability
of
people
to
band
together
under
what
rules
they
desire
to
take
political
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
is
that
by
simply
agreeing
to
put
whoever
forms
such
an
association
on
the
ballot,
the
state
acquires
considerable
control
over
the
manner
in
which
those
people
have
to
conduct
their
political
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
few
of
them.
how
many
has
he
precleared?
justice
antonin
scalia
party
submissions?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
what...
outside
of
the
context
of
primaries?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
outside
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
necessary
part
of
your
position,
is
it
not,
that
you
cannot
form
a
party
on
any
basis
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
or
unlawful
for
the
state
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
state
agrees
to
let
them
on
the
ballot,
the
state
can
effectively
preclude
a
party
from
being
formed
that
is
all
black,
that
is
all
white,
that
is
all
rich
people,
that
is
all
poor
people,
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
we
will
only
prevent
these
specialized
parties
when
they're
successful.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they
wanted
to
but
didn't
think
they
had
the
power
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course.
i
mean,
why
not
interpret
state
there
to
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
state
means
under
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
would
have
to
concede
that
the
statute
would
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
when
you
say,
be
involved
in
a
primary,
a
party
would
still
be
able
to
maintain
its
own
integrity,
however
kooky
it
may
be,
if
it
decided
to
pay
for
its
own
primary.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
decided,
we
are
having
a
party
sponsored
statewide
vote,
and
it
sets
up,
you
know,
precincts
in
which
people
can
come
and
vote.
that's
not
what
you
mean
by
a
primary.
you
mean
a
state
run
primary.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
the
other
ones,
the
solicitor
general...
you
mentioned
300
that
did
not
deal
with
primaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
perhaps
the
solicitor
general
can
tell
us
where
this
300
number
appears.
are
you
saying,
to
go
back
for
a
second...
let's
go
back
30
years,
or
20
years,
and
you're
a
member
of
congress,
and
suppose
what
you're
concerned
about
is
that
the
major
party,
the
republicans
or
the
democrats,
say
only
white
people
can
vote
in
our
primary,
and
that's
terrible,
and
you
want
to
make
it
illegal,
and
probably
the
constitution
does.
and
then
the
idea
comes
through,
maybe
what
they'll
do
is
have
a
primary,
they'll
just
call
it
a
convention,
and
they
won't
go
into
a
voting
machine,
they'll
go
meet
somewhere.
are
you
saying
congress,
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
lacks
the
constitutional
power
to
forbid
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
paid
for
it
themselves,
yes,
if
it
wasn't
a
state
run
primary.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
freedom
to
associate
is
not
the
freedom
to
have
the
government
pay
for
your
association.
i
think
once
you
get
the
government
in,
paying
for
the
primary,
it's
a
different
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
a
state
cannot
limit
the
ballot
to
labor
union
members.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
a
political
party
limit
the
ballot
to
labor
union
members?
can
you
have
a
labor
union
political
party?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no
primary,
just
as
a
convention.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
say,
you
can't
get
into
the
convention
unless
you
are
a
union
member.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
successful
on
the
first
election,
and
therefore
is
automatically
listed
on
the
ballot
in
later
elections.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
know?
i
don't
understand
why
you...
wouldn't
the
same
principle
you're
announcing
to
us
apply
to
that
as
well
as
to
this
situation?
