justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
karlan,
may
i
inquire,
your
brief
suggests
possibly
three
different
theories
of
why
section
5
might
have
been
violated,
and
the
first
is
that
the
45
fee
affects
the
process
of
selecting
the
nominee,
and
the
second
is
that
being
a
delegate
to
the
convention
is
an
elective
party
office,
and
third
is
the
threat
that
the
change
from
a
primary
election
to
a
nominating
convention
required
preclearance.
now,
were
either
of
those
last
two
theories
contained
in
the
complaint,
and
were
they
raised
below?
are
they
actually
here,
or
do
we
just
look
at
the
45
fee
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
change
from
a
primary
to
a
convention,
was
that...
it
was
not
part
of
your
complaint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
talked
about
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
below
did
not
deal
with
those...
with
the
second
and
third
so
called
theories?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
think
it
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
the
change
itself
from
a
primary
to
a
convention
required
preclearance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
certainly
not
expressly.
it
didn't
expressly
deal
with
that,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
karlan,
the
attorney
general
has
adopted
a
number
of
regulations
pursuant
to
section
5
and
the
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act.
do
you
concede
that
all
the
attorney
general's
regulations
that
are
relevant
here
are
valid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
rely
on
those
regulations
to
make
your
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
absent
those
regulations,
your
position
would
be
sustained
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bender,
i
can
understand
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
if
the
state
permits
a
party
to
change
from
a
primary
election
to
a
convention
method,
that
that
action
by
the
state
in
allowing
that
change
is
something
that
in
and
of
itself
could
be
challenged
under
section
5,
but
i'm
not
sure
that's
what
was
done
here.
i'm
not
sure
that
question
is
here
before
us,
and
we're
reaching
it
by
a
very
different
route,
as
i
see
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
back
up
a
minute.
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
open
to
challenge
under
section
5
if
the
state
allows
a
change
from
a
primary
election
to
a
convention
method?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
question
is
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
getchell,
do
you
concede
the
validity
of
the
attorney
general's
regulations
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
regulations
seem
to
extend
the
application
to
political
parties
in
some
circumstances.
do
you
concede
that
that's
a
valid
interpretation,
that
a
political
party
can
be
a
state
actor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
you
answer
my
question?
do
you
concede
that
a
political
party
can
be
a
state
actor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
curious
line
to
draw,
because
where
the
state
is
conducting
primary
election
activities
by
way
of
administering
them,
i
assume
that
any
change
can
be
challenged
by
a
suit
against
the
state
itself,
so
the
line
you
would
draw
is
a
little
curious,
i
would
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
so
i
would
have
thought
you
might
just
say,
well,
the
statute
doesn't
reach
political
parties,
but
that's
not
your
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
jurisprudence
are
you
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
getchell,
what
about
the
change
that
justice
breyer
asked
about
from
the
conduct
of
a
primary
election
to
holding
a
party
convention
instead?
is
that
action
subject
to
challenge
under
section
5?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
there
were
a
change,
a
party
says,
okay,
the
statute
will
reach
us
if
we
exclude
people
under
the
primary
so
we
want
to
change
to
a
convention
system,
would
that
change
be
subject
to
challenge--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
your
view?
