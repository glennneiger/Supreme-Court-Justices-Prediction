justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
karlan,
may
i
go
back
to
the
textual
argument?
you...
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
you're
saying
that
"state"
is
to
be
construed
to
include
anyone
who
exercises
a
state
function.
the
process
of
winnowing
candidates
down
is
a
state
function,
therefore,
it
applies
here.
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--basically
what
you're
saying?
if
that's
the
way
the
congress
intended
the
word
state
to
be
construed,
why
did
it
refer
to
political
subdivision
at
all?
because
it
seems
to
me...
maybe
i'm
missing
something,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
political
subdivision
would
be
included
on
your
definition
without
specific
reference
to
it,
without
the
need
for
specific
reference
to
it,
whenever
it
was
engaged
in...
in
effect
in
discharging
any
of
the
processes
by
which
the
state
government
would
ultimately
bring
an
election
or
a
series
of
choices
to
be
made
in
election
before
the
people,
so
why
is
it
in
there
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
ah.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
at
least
it
would
have
been
a
serious
question.
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
have
one
further
question.
under
your
view,
if,
in
a
covered
jurisdiction,
there
is
a
small
group
of
citizens,
two
or
three
of
them,
who
have
substantial
community
influence
and
many,
many
funds,
if
they
meet
in
someone's
home
to
decide
who's
going
to
be
the
candidate,
and
their
voice
is
in
effect
conclusive
as
to
who
will
be
the
successful
candidate
in
a
particular
party,
are
they
covered?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bender,
i
thought
you
had
said
that
state
is
not
coterminous
with
state
action,
because
you're
saying
that
the
addition
of
this
element
of
preference,
as
you
put
it,
is
crucial.
you
said
that
if
a
state
allowed
any
party
onto
the
ballot
on
the
same...
to
place
a
candidate
on
the
ballot
on
the
same
terms
as
any
other
party,
that
that
would
not
trigger
applicability,
and
yet
that
would
be
state
action,
would
it
not,
because
each
of
the
parties,
including
the
little
splinter
group
that
was
in
the
hypo,
would
be
performing
a
state
function
of
winnowing
candidates
down?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
once
they
organize
themselves
and
say,
the
five
of
us
are
going
to
be
the
x
party,
and
the
state
says,
yes,
five
signatures
on
a
petition
is
enough
to
get
on
the
ballot,
they
would
then
be,
on
your
theory,
performing
state
actions.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
are
performing
the
state
function
even
in
that
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
winnowing
possible
candidates
down
is
not
a
state
function.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
getchell,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
it
is
only
exercising
that
function,
on
your
view,
if
it
is
in
fact
using
traditional
state
machinery?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
in...
it
is
fair
to
say,
i
take
it,
then,
on
your
view
that
although
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
the
party
would
be
covered,
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
the
party
would
be
covered
which
could
not
also
be
subject
to
a
challenge
directly
to
the
state
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
you
don't
take
the
position
that
you
have
got...
that
we
would
have
to
hold
that
what
you
were
engaging
in
was
a
primary
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
in
order
to
be
covered.
you
don't
take
that
position,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
you're
not
saying
that
as
a
textual
matter
this
has
got
to
be
a
primary
within--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
meaning
of
this
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
you
agree
that
voting
might
be...
that
the
voting
requirement
might
be
complied
with
here
even
if
state
or
subdivision
is
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
do
not
think
that
the
action
in
question
here,
the
45
fee,
is
within
the
purview
of
the
defined
term,
voting,
in
section
14?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
because
you
think
a
delegate
is
not
a
party
official?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
you
don't...
as
you
conceded
a
moment
ago,
that's
not
necessarily
the
case
for
statutory
applicability,
and
doesn't...
i
don't
have
the
voting
definition
in
front
of
me,
but
doesn't
it
include...
i
guess
it
was
in
the
later
amendment,
at
least
in
the
tail
end
of
it,
voting
for
a
party
official?
isn't
that
included
within
the
meaning--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
i
mean,
why?
isn't...
a
delegate
to
a
party
convention
is
a
party
official.
justice
david
h.
souter
why,
therefore,
doesn't
the
term,
or
the
definition
by
its
terms
cover
voting
for
that
official?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
stop
half
way
through
the
definition.
justice
david
h.
souter
complete
the
definition,
and
you
pick
up
party
official.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
party
official
i
presume
is
a
broader
concept
than
merely
the
concept
of
those
who,
in
the
gross
sense,
would
be
subject
to
a
statewide
primary,
for
example.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
now
they're
elected,
it
appears
in
some
cases,
by
convention,
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
definition
which
excludes
them
from
the
definition
when...
insofar
as
it
extends
to
party
officials.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the--
--i
still
have
a
problem
in...
the
defined
term
is
that
voting
includes
all
action
necessary
to
make
a
vote
effective,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
cover
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
sure
that
you
lose
even
if
we
concede
that
this
is
voting.
maybe
you
do.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
well,
let's
take
a
simpler
tack.
going
back
to
the
definition
of
voting
again,
if
we
start
with
the
assumption
that
one
act
which
would
have
an
effect
on
voting
in
primary,
special,
and
general
elections,
may
be
the
act
of
selecting
party
officials,
as
the
definition
seems
to
say,
and
if,
in
fact,
a
delegate
here
is
a
party
official,
why
doesn't
that
alone
extend
the
act
on
its
terms
to
cover
the
situation?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
doesn't
require
that
the
election
of
the
party
official
be
in
a
primary,
special,
or
general
election.
it
simply
requires
that
we
hold
that
the
act
of
electing
or
selecting
the
party
official
can
ultimately
have
an
effect
on
the
effectiveness
of
votes
in
primary,
special,
or
general
elections.
if
that
is
the
case,
that's
enough
for
coverage
of
this
practice,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
voting.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
read
the
definition
of
voting
as
i
have
just
suggested
it
may
be
read,
then
you
lose,
i
take
it.
in
other
words,
you
can't
accept
that
reading
of
the
term,
of
the
definition
of
voting
and
still
win
this
case--
justice
david
h.
souter
--under
the
section
5
issue--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
we're
not
talking
about
time,
place,
and
date.
we're
talking
about
the
possible
application
of
the
act
to
a
fee
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
we
don't
stop
with
the
fee,
but
maybe
we
start
with
the
fee.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
somebody
does
wish
to
start
with
the
fee--
[laughter]
--and
my
difficulty
with
your
argument
is
that
it
seems
to
me
quite
possible,
and
in
fact
even
easy,
to
read
the
definition
as
covering
this
particular
requirement
for
the
election
of
a
party
official
whose
selection
may
have
an
effect
on
the
effectiveness
of
votes
in
the
ultimate
election.
and
the
fact
that
the
application
in
this
instance
may
raise
other
questions
about
whether
it
applies
to
the
timing
of
these
delegate
selections
and
so
on
is
something
to
consider,
but
there's
still
the
problem
of
why,
on
its
face,
this
does
not
apply.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
i...
oh.
justice
david
h.
souter
were
you
finished?
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
were
you
done?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
explain
to
me
the
significance
of
the
preferential
treatment
for
purposes
of
the
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
i'll
concede
that,
but
why
is
that
necessary
for
your
case?
