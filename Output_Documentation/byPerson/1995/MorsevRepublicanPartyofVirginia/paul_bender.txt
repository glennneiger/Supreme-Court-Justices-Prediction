mr.
paul
bender
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
under
virginia
law,
a
political
party
that
gets
10
percent
or
more
of
the
vote
at
an
election
is
entitled
to
place
the
candidate
it
selects
for
the
u.s.
senate
on
the
ballot
in
a
preferred
position
as
long
as
the
party
maintains
a
certain
kind
of
organization
prescribed
by
the
state.
the
party
is
then
entitled
under
virginia
law
to
choose
its
candidate
either
through
a
primary,
or
through
a
convention,
or
through
some
other
means.
both
the
district
court
and
the
appellees
in
this
case
agree
that
if
the
party
chooses
to
choose
its
candidate
through
a
primary
election,
that
changes
in
the
rules
about
who
can
vote
at
that
primary
election
to
choose
the
candidate
are
covered
by
section
5.
i
think
that's
common
ground.
the
district
court,
however,
decided
that
if
the
party
chooses
not
to
use
the
primary
elections
as
a
way
of
choosing
its
candidates,
but
instead
to
choose
through
a
convention,
then
section
5
does
not
apply.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
the
question
is
whether,
under
state
law,
a
party
or
any
other
group
has
a
right
to
put
a
candidate
on
the
ballot
in
a
preferred
position
if
they
maintain
a
certain
organization.
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
if
a
party
is
given
that
power
under
state
law,
whether,
when
the
party
makes
a
change
and
who
can
participate
in
that
selection
process,
whether
that
is
subject
to
preclearance--
mr.
paul
bender
--yes,
if
the
state...
if
state
law
did
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
don't
think
that
question
is
before
you
in
this
case.
i
think
the
district
court
did
not
decide
that
question.
if...
it's
unclear
in
this
case
whether
that
kind
of
change
was
made,
because
they
apparently
have
never
used
a...
have
never
used
a
primary,
even
though
on
a
couple
of
occasions
the
party
has
said
it
was
going
to
have
a
primary.
that
question
of
whether
that
change
was
made
has
not
been
decided
below
and
would
have
to
be
remanded,
but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
do
that,
because
the
change
in...
it
seems
to
me
the
basic
principle
here
is
that
the
change
in
the
people
who
can
select
a
candidate
to
go
on
the
ballot
is
a
change
sufficiently
related
to
the
general
election
so
that
that
change
needs
to
be
precleared,
and
that's
true
whether
the
change
occurs
through
a
matter
of
state
law,
or
the
change
occurs
through
a
matter
of
city
law,
or
county
law,
or
political
party
law
when
the
political
party
is
given
the
right
to
put
the
candidate
on
the
ballot
in
a
preferred
position.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that
case
would
come
out
the
same
way--
mr.
paul
bender
--although
it's
a
little
bit
closer.
mr.
paul
bender
i
wouldn't
say
any
change
in
the
process
by
which
the
party
selects
the
candidates.
i
think
this
case
involves
something
that's
very
close
to
the
election
process,
and
that
is
the
people
who
can
select
the
party's
candidates.
if
you
affirm
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
this
case,
that
would
mean
that
in
a
state
like
virginia,
where
parties
have
an
automatic
place
on
the
ballot,
that
major
parties
could
preclude
members
of
certain
races
from
voting
for
the
candidate
to
go
on
the
ballot.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
and
i
think
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
the
attorney
general's
regulations
about
the
coverage
of
political
parties,
which
have
existed
since
1982...
the
attorney
general
has
actually
precleared
party
submissions
since
1972,
and
has--
mr.
paul
bender
--over
1,000.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
including
the
context
of
primaries.
mr.
paul
bender
about--
mr.
paul
bender
--over...
between
300
and
400
outside
of
the
context
of
primaries.
one,
for
example,
comes
from
virginia,
which
is
in
the
lodging
that
was
made
with
the
court.
in
1982,
the
democratic
party
in
virginia
precleared,
and
assistant
attorney
general
reynolds
tried
to
preclear,
and
assistant
attorney
general
reynolds
did
preclear
a
change
almost
identical
to
the
change,
in
terms
of
its
relation
to
the
voting
process
almost
identical
to
the
change
in
this
case.
it
was
a
change
in
the
way
the
vote
was
going
to
be
allocated
at
the
party's
convention,
and
they...
the
democratic
party
in
virginia
applied
for
preclearance,
and
preclearance
was
given,
and
as
i
say,
there
have
been
over
300
of
those
kinds
of
submissions
over
the
years.
the
attorney
general's
regulations--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
key
to
this
case
is
the
state's
relationship
to
the
party.
if...
people
can
form
a
party,
form
a
group
as
in
justice
kennedy's
question,
and
decide
that
they're
going
to
support
a
nominee
at
the
election,
and
if
you
need
15,000
signatures
to
put
their
nominee
on
the
ballot,
they're
going
to
go
out
and
get
the
15,000
signatures.
if
five
of
them
have
been
doing
that
for
10
years
and
decide
let's
let
a
sixth
person
into
that
group,
there
needs
to
be
no
preclearance,
because
there
isn't
the
kind
of
connection
there
is
here
between
state
law
and
what
the
party
does.
parties
have
an
official
position--
mr.
paul
bender
--if
it
lets
them
on
the
ballot
in
the
same
way
it
lets
anybody
else
on
the
ballot,
then
preclearance
doesn't
apply.
mr.
paul
bender
preclearance
applies
when
it
has
special
rules
for
parties,
and
it...
don't...
i
don't
think
you
should
denigrate
the
preferred
position
that
parties
get.
in
virginia,
they
are
listed
first
on
the
ballot.
every
study
of
elections
that
i
know
says
that
that
is
worth
an
enormous
amount,
to
be
listed
before
the
independent
candidates.
virginia
has
given
them
that
privilege.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
not
when
they're
successful.
we
only
require
preclearance
of
the
party's
rules
when
the
party
is
given
by
the
state
some
power
that
other
people
don't
have.
the
attorney
general's
regulation
under
section
5
attempts
to
cut
down...
this
court's
decisions
about
what
has
to
be
precleared
because
of
its
relationship
to
a
general
election
are
very
broad,
starting
with
the
allen
case.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
not
a
political
subdivision,
justice
kennedy,
it's
the
state
under
the
statute.
mr.
paul
bender
the
concept
of
the
state.
as
ms.
karlan
said,
the
political
subdivision
is
in
there
because
they're
talking
about
the
coverage
formula.
the
two
things
are--
mr.
paul
bender
--and
as
the
court
said
in
sheffield,
the
concept
of
state
and
political
subdivision
are
territorial,
and
within
that
territory,
every
entity,
as
sheffield
said,
which
would
be
the
state
under
the
court's
state
action
principles...
and
it's
clear
that
a
party
in
this
respect
would
be
the
state.
every
entity
that
would
be
the
state
is
covered,
so
the
state
is
used
in
section
5
as
the
word
state
is
used
in
this
court's
state
action
jurisprudence,
not
in
the
formal
sense
of
the
state,
and
you
can
see
that
in
the
dougherty
case,
for
example,
where
a
school
board
put
a
financial
burden
on
an
employee
and
said
they
had
to
take
a
leave
in
order
to
run
for
election,
and
the
court
held
that
that
had
to
be
precleared.
now,
that
school
board
has
nothing
to
do
with
voting.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
except
that
the
attorney
general's
regulations
should
be
given
a
lot
of
deference
in
dealing
with
that
definition,
and
the
attorney
general's
regulations
have
tried
to
trim
that
concept
some
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
constitutionally
protected
right
of
political
association.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
the
question,
justice
souter,
is
whether
the
action
of
a
group
of
people
in
deciding
who
they're
going
to
support
for
election,
who
they're
going
to
go
out
and
get
signatures
for,
is
state
action,
and
i'm
very
doubtful
whether,
if
five
of
us
get
together
and
decide
to
get
50,000
signatures--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
line
would
be
drawn
there
if
they're
treated--
mr.
paul
bender
--may
i
finish
answering--
mr.
paul
bender
--if
they're
treated
just
like
any
other
group
of
people,
then
i
don't
think
they
are.
at
least
under--
mr.
paul
bender
--they
are
performing
a
state
function...
i
don't
think
so.
i
think...
i
don't
see
how
deciding
who
you're
going
to
support
for
election
is
performing
a
state
function.
mr.
paul
bender
not
in
itself,
no.
