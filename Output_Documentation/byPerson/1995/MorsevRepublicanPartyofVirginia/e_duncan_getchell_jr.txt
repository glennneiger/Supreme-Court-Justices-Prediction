mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed
because
it's
in
accord
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
the
voting
rights
act
applies
to
a
state
or
political
subdivision
which
is
covered
by
certain
terms
in
section
4
of
the
act
when
that
state
or
political
subdivision
alters
a
qualification
or
prerequisite
for
voting
or
a
standard
practice
or
procedure
without...
with
respect
to
voting
and
voting,
as
you
would
expect
in
a
statute
about
voting,
is
a
defined
term,
and
voting
is
defined
as
those
actions
necessary
to
make
a
vote
effective
in
a
primary,
special,
or
general
election.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
not
if
they
are
construed
as
the
attorney
general
would
have
them
be
construed,
because
i
think
that
would
raise
grave
first
amendment
issues.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
there
are
certain
actions
performed
by
the
political
parties
which
are
clearly
delegated
public
electoral
functions,
involving
exclusively--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--it
can
be.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
it
can
be.
i
think
the
only
area
where
it
ever
is
is
when
it
is
conducting
a
primary,
and
when
it
is
setting
rules
for
a
primary,
because
a
primary
implicates
the
machinery
of
the
state,
the
electoral
machinery
of
the
state,
the
state
ballot
boxes,
the
state
officers,
the
state
polling
places.
it
has
traditionally
been
a
state
function
because
it's
neutral.
it
exists
only
to
count
votes.
on
the
other
hand,
a
convention
is
intensely
political.
the
nominating
process
itself,
the
decision
to
nominate
anybody,
is
personal
and
political,
it's
not--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
think
the
line
that
i
have
drawn
is
the
one
that
the
attorney
general
sought
to
draw
in
the
regulation.
the
statute
itself
doesn't
address
political
parties
at
all.
the
regulation
says
that
the
party--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--it
does
not
reach
political
parties
on
its
face.
the
jurisprudence
that
has
developed
in
the
lower
courts
has
drawn
the
distinction
between
primaries
when
it
is
deemed
to
be
acting
as
the
state
and
conventions
and
other--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
am
talking
about
williams
v.
the
democratic
party,
which
this
court
summarily
affirmed
in
1972.
the
congress
has
twice
readopted
the
voting
rights
act
since
then,
presumably
knowing
of
that
jurisprudence.
basically,
that
case
said
it
does
not
apply
to
conventions.
macguire
v.
amos,
decided
the
same
year,
although
it
was
dicta
in
a
footnote,
distinguished
williams
v.
democratic
party
to
note
that
a
convention
was
not
involved
in
the
alabama
case.
so
without
conceding
that
in
all
circumstances
that
that
regulation
is
valid,
it
was
not
our
purpose
to
challenge
the
regulation.
our
purpose
was
to
say
that
the
regulation
clearly
excludes
us,
because
the
regulation
only
applies
to
a
political
party
if
1)
the
political
party
is
exercising
a
traditional
public
electoral
function,
and
b)
that
function
has
been
delegated.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
well,
if
it
were
viewed
as
a
direct
qualification
for
voting
in
the
primary,
it
presumably
would
be.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
were
viewed
as
a
delegate
registration
fee,
this
court
has
struck
down
exorbitant
delegation...
i
mean,
delegate
or
candidate
registration
fees,
but
it
said
that
it
was
not
saying
that
they
were
improper
in
all
circumstances.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
would
commend
to
your
honor
the
law
review
article
by
a
professor
weisburd
that
we
have
cited
several
times
in
our
briefs,
where
he
makes
the
political
science
point
that
they're
quite
different
animals.
the
state
provides
neutral
electoral
machinery.
it
has
no
valid
interest
but
that
the
votes
be
fairly
counted.
the
convention
is
a
voluntary,
grassroots
meeting
of
people
who
are
seeking
a
very
unneutral
end.
they
are
exercising
their
core
first
amendment
rights,
and
anything
that
attempts
to
trench
on
that
would
have
to
be
justified
by
compelling
state
interest
and
a
narrowly
tailored
piece
of
legislation.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
this...
practically,
what
this
45
fee
is
is
reflected
by
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
voluntary
organization.
because
we
have
the
largest
political
primary,
we
believe,
in
the
western...
i
mean,
not...
we
have
the
largest
convention,
although
they
call
it
a
primary.
i'm
getting
ahead
of
myself...
they
want
to
criticize
our
convention.
they
want
to
call
it
an
indoor
primary
because
it's
so
inclusive.
then,
at
the
same
time,
they
want
to
say
it's
exclusive
because
a
fee
is
charged.
because
the
convention
is
so
large,
with
14,000
delegates
at
the
most
recent
convention,
we
have
to
hire
the
largest
hall
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
and
it
costs
money.
in
the
affidavit
that
was
filed
with
respect
to
the
'93
convention,
the
number
was
300,000.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
don't
see--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
may
have
misunderstood
the
hypothetical.
if
you
are
asking
whether
or
not
the
party,
or
a
party
could
do
unreasonable
things,
extreme
things,
be
a
feminist
party,
be
a
racial
party,
be
a
party
of
plutocrats
or
a
party
of
intellectuals,
yes,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
have
state
action,
it
can.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
it
would
be
suicidal.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
we
agree
that's
covered.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
they...
i
think
they
very
definitely
wanted
to
avoid
any
collision
with
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
am
saying--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
am
saying
simply,
justice
breyer,
that
they
didn't
cover
it.
now,
it
could
be--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--well,
i
believe
they
would
have
very
grave
constitutional
problems.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
would
submit
that
it
is
first
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
i
would
submit
that
it's
secondly
in
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
twice
been
reaffirmed,
or
repassed,
knowing
what
the
jurisprudence
was.
i
would
say
that
the
prior
practice
is
not
that
convention
rules
have
been
cleared.
only
one
has
been
brought
to
this
court's
attention,
one
incidence
when
the
democratic
party
of
virginia
did
it
in
1982,
whether
in
error
or
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
i
do
not
know.
i
would
say
that
on
the
legislative
history,
that
all
of
the
legislative
history
is
either
for
my
position
or
neutral,
except
for
the
one
statement
by
congressman
bingham.
i
would
say
that
this
court
has
traditionally
held
that
one
chance
statement
by
one
congressman
is
not
valid
legislative
history.
i
would
say
that
if
you
look
at
section
11,
which
is
the
criminal
part
of
this
act,
which
has
to
be
narrowly
construed,
they
use
the
same
language
about
primary,
special,
and
general
elections,
and
i
would
submit
that
that
would
not...
that
they
didn't
use
that
language
differently
in
two
different
places.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
that
challenge,
1)
may
i
say
with
respect
to
that
question
that
we
submit
that
no
such
change
was
made,
that
this--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
believe--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
believe
that
the
statute
that
permits,
in
the
state's
view,
a
party
to
call
upon
it
to
conduct
a
primary,
when
that
statute
is
changed,
that
is
subject
to
preclearance.
i
believe
arguably
when
the
state
acquiesces
in
a
call
for
the
party
to
actually
conduct
the
primary,
that
that
requires
preclearance.
when
the
party
has
a
statute
like
we
have
in
virginia
which
says,
you
can
have
a
convention
or
a
primary,
let
us
know
if
you
want
a
primary,
and
elects
to
make
the
change,
i
don't
think
the
party
as
a
party
is
subject
to
preclearance,
because
under
your
traditional
state
action
case
law,
blum
v.
yaretsky,
for
example,
if
a
private
actor
is
making
private
choices
within
a
statutory
framework,
that
is...
does
not
trigger
state
action.
so
i
would
say
that
whenever
the
state
changes
its
law,
or
when
a
state
makes...
changes
a
practice,
that's
subject
to
preclearance.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
what
we
do
is
not.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
think
it's
good
law,
but
i
think--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
would
say
that
terry
v.
adams
and
smith
v.
allwright
are
extremely
fact
specific.
i
would
say
the
commentators
have
said
that
as
well.
i
would
adopt
professor
weisburd's
analysis,
which
is
those
cases
were
only
applicable
because
of
the
pervasive
state
regulation.
the
state
required
that
a
primary
be
conducted.
it
required
that
the
party
decide
who
could
vote
in
the
primary.
it
was
obviously
in
complicity
with
the
racist
intentions
of
the
democratic
party.
it
furthermore--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--that
is
subject
to
the
same
analysis.
it
depends
upon
a
pervasive
state
regulation
of
the
democratic
party.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
the
opinions,
of
course,
in
both
smith
v.
allwright
and
in
terry
v.
adams
i
believe
were
plurality
opinions,
and
basically
the
state
action
for
most
or
all
of
the
justices
noted
the
fact
that
it
was
a
one
party
state,
that
the
nomination
was
tantamount
to
election.
the
cases
clearly
view
that
the
public
function
being
delegated
is
the
selection
of
public
officers--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--if
virginia
were
a
one
party
state,
it
would
be
subject
to
suit
under
the
same
theory
under
the
constitution.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
don't
concede
this
act
would
apply.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
if
you
had
only...
if
you
had
the
same
facts
you
had
in
those
cases,
you
would
get
the
same
results
under
the
constitution.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
under
specifically
section
5--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--of
the
statute?
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
party
were
exercising
its--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--if
it
has...
if
there's
only
one
party
with
10...
more
than
10
percent
of
the
vote,
then
presumably
28
c.f.r.
51.7,
the
attorney
general's
regulation,
would
cover
what
the
party's
doing,
because
it
would
be--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--the
statute
does
not
by
its
terms
cover
it
unless
you
then
view
the
state
as
the
actor.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
you
would
then,
under
that
jurisprudence,
have
a
court
entitled
logically
to
say
that
the
party
was
the
state,
and
therefore
the
act
covered
it.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
sure.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
sure.
but
we're--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--but
there's
no
case
law
that
says
that
when
we're
engaged
merely
in
the
nomination
function
that
we're
engaged
in
a
state
action.
there
is--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
take
the
position
that
we
have
to
be
the
state,
that
being
involved
in
a
primary
has
been
held
by
many
courts
to
be
state
action,
that--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--no.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
no.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
but
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
where
we
end
up.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
well--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
mean
a
state
run
primary.
dr.
weis...
professor
weisburd
points
out
that
some
states
purport
to
have
laws
that
require
primaries,
require
political
parties
to
engage
in
primaries.
he
points
out
that
after
your
decision
in
democratic
party
of
the
u.s.
v.
wisconsin,
and
particularly
footnote
31,
those
statutes
are
all
presumptively
unconstitutional.
if
we,
as
a
party,
want
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
public
apparatus
of
a
primary,
then
we
entangle
ourselves
with
the
state,
and
the
state
action
at
least
is
subject
to
preclearance,
but
when
we
merely
nominate
with
our
own
people
in
our
own
convention,
we
are
not
subject
to
the
prior
leave
of
the
government.
it
would
be
terribly
unseemly
if
an
organization
that
exists
to
change
the
government
had
to
preclear
the
time,
place,
date,
and
rules
for
its
convention,
even
if
conceptually
you
could
do
that,
which
you
can't,
because
a
convention
is
a
law
unto
itself.
it
makes
its
own
rules.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
in
any--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
most
vigorously
deny
that
it
would
be
satisfied
here.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
think
it's
because
we're
not
dealing
with
a
primary,
special,
or
general
election.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
voting
for
the
party
official
has
always
been
in
there,
but
that
means
voting
in
a
primary,
because
voting
is
a--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
it
is
anything
necessary
to
make
a
vote
effective
in
a
primary,
special,
or
general
election,
which
i
think
has
a
very
distinct
meaning
that--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
don't--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
agree--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--party
officials,
particularly
in
the
south,
democratic
party
officials
when
the
act
was
passed,
were
elected
in
primaries.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
party
officials
are
not
excluded
as
long
as
they're
elected
in
primary,
special,
or
general
elections.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
well,
what
it
would--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--well,
the
reason
that
i'm
very
concerned
about
that
point
of
view,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
it
is
not
a
state
function
to
nominate,
and
even
though
that
conceptually,
if
you
don't
have
a
candidate
you
don't
make
a
vote
effective,
what
is
being
argued
for
by
the
appellants
is
very,
very
radical.
it
says
that
if
we
nominate,
then
we're
part
of
voting.
now,
this
was
an
argument...
again,
professor
weisburd
points
out
this
was
an
argument
that
was
made
by
commentators
in
the
sixties
following
the
'68
democratic
convention.
there
were
some
lower
courts
that
seemed
to
make
nomination
a
public
function.
and
then
he
reviewed
your
first
amendment
jurisprudence,
particularly
in
cousins
v.
wigoda
and
in
democratic
party
of
the
u.s.
v.
wisconsin,
and
i
would
add
to
that
the
eu
case,
and
it
is
perfectly...
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
persuasive
that
this
court
would
say
that
everything
that
happens
prior
to
an
election,
and
the
involvement
of
state
apparatus,
is
first
amendment
private
activity.
it
is
not
a
state
function.
and
justice
souter,
with
all
deference,
on
the
idea
that
winnowing
is
a
state
function,
that
is
a
notion
that
comes
out
the
storer
case,
but
in
virginia
there
is
no
winnowing,
because
in
california,
if
you
ran
in
the
primary
you
couldn't
run
in
the
general
election,
and
so
the
state
was
at
least
having
the
mass
of
people
claiming
a
right
to
be
on
the
ballot
reduced.
in
virginia,
if
you
are
nominated
by
a
convention,
if
the
nomination
is
by
the
convention,
a
losing
party
can
run
as
an
independent.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
well--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
can't
read
the
text,
justice
souter,
that
way.
i
think
that
the
text,
the
meaning
of
the
text
is
that
if
you
make
a
change
in
a
practice
or
procedure
or
standard
for
voting--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--with
respect
to
a
primary,
special,
or
general
election
for
any
number
of
people,
including
state
officers,
that
you
are
at
least
covered
by
the
text
of
the
act.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
one
of
the
reasons--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--well--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
could,
i
suppose,
ultimately,
because
i
would
submit
that
if,
in
fact,
the
law
is
that
each
of
the
126
units
in
virginia
which
has
its
convention
in
mass
meeting,
which
leads
to
up
to
100
legislative
district
conventions
and
up
to
40
state
senate
legislative
district
conventions,
and
in
some
years
11
congressional
district
conventions,
and
then
the
state
convention,
if
the
rule
is
that
before
these
people
who
don't
have
lawyers,
who
don't
have
people
to
preclear
with
the
justice
department,
before
these
people
can
meet,
they
have
to
first
clear
the
time,
place,
and
date
with
the
justice
department--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--you
can't
stop
with
the
fee,
because
if
the
fee
is
a
practice--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--if
you...
if...
well,
i
would
suggest
that
you
should
not
wish
to
start
with
the
fee,
because
i
believe
that
you--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--the
ordinary
rule
of
construction
of
this
court
is
that
if
you
are
offered
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
raises
grave
constitutional
issues,
you
will
avoid
it
unless
you
are
compelled
to
that
construction
by
the
clear
intent
of
congress.
and
my
point
is,
if
you
start
with
the
fee,
you
can
never
stop
there,
because
the
only
intellectually
coherent
grounds
for
saying
that
the
fee
is
covered
is
to
say
that
the
party
is
engaged
in
state
action
by
the
mere
act
of
nominating,
and
therefore
the
whole
process
is
ultimately
federalized
to
the
same
extent
it
would
be
if
it
were
state
action.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
actually,
the
amicus
brief,
justice
ginsburg,
filed
by
the
government
acknowledges
that
they
do
contend
that
the
time,
the
place,
the
date,
are
all
covered.
and
remember,
this
is
30
years
too
late,
it
seems
to
me,
to
adopt
radical
new
interpretations--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--in
their
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
was
going
to
make
the
additional
point
that
it
is
too
far
down
the
road.
remember,
the
whole
purpose
of
section
5
was
to
freeze
in
time
in
1964
the
practices
that
were
potentially
discriminatory
so
that
states
wouldn't
change
them
just
as
fast
as
the
courts
struck
them
down.
now,
the
remedy
for
section
5
is
to
go
back
to
where
you
were
in
1964.
well,
in
1964,
the
republican
party
held
its
convention
for
this
senate
seat
in
the
john
marshall
hotel,
which
is
boarded
up
and
closed,
and
it
held
the
next
convention
in
the
hotel
roanoke,
which
is
something
else
entirely.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
statute
or
remedy
which
makes
any
sense
30
years
down
the
road
to
give
an
unexpected
interpretation
to,
and
the
interpretation
would
now
be
extremely
unexpected.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
well,
the
attorney
general's
regulation
has
been
on
the
books
for
some
period
of
time.
i
don't
know
the
exact
date.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
the
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
justice
stevens,
is
what
is
unexpected
to
me.
the
regulation
on
its
face
says--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
think
that
the
turner
appendix
which
has
been
alluded
to
does
not
on
its
face
disclose
that
any
of
those
submissions
had
to
do
with
conventions.
only
one
submission
having
to
do
with
convention
rules
has
been
brought
to
this
court's
attention,
and--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
don't...
i've
never
heard
that
number.
that
number's
not
in
any
of
the
briefs,
or
in
the
record.
what
is
before
the
court
are
a
handful
of
documents
that
the
solicitor
general
mailed
to
the
court
and
to
counsel
last
week,
or
week
before
last.
most
of
them
have
to
do
with
the
green
party,
the
republican
party,
and
the
democratic
party
in
alaska.
the
letter
is
dated
september
18
to
the
clerk
of
this
court.
except
for
the
virginia
convention
submission,
they
all
have
to
do
with
changes
in
primaries
in
alaska.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
would
submit
two
things.
one
is,
the
fifteenth
amendment
requires
state
action.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
for
two
reasons--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--for
two
reasons...
yes.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
if
i
may
elaborate,
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
it's
not
a
state
function
when
you
have
nominations,
and
it
doesn't
involve
state
apparatus.
secondly,
the
preclearance
of
this
bill
is
too
blunt,
it's
not
finely
tailored
when
it
impinges
on
first
amendment
rights,
and
congress
therefore
wouldn't
have
adopted
section
5
to
deal
with
that
problem.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
thank
you.
