justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
your
view...
this
is
what
i...
i
mean,
the...
it's
a
difficult
question,
i
realize,
but
i
put
the
obvious
question
to
you.
in
your
view,
if
the
democratic
party
or
the
republican
party,
neither
of
which
would,
but
there
used
to
be
a
problem,
if
either
of
them
said,
i
have
a
primary,
and
only
white
people
can
vote,
we
agree
that's
illegal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
now
what
they
do
is,
we're
not
going
to
have
a
primary.
rather,
we're
going
to
call
every
voter
who
wants
to
come
and
vote
in
the
primary
to
come
to
my
meeting,
whoever
wants
to
come,
and
we
will
vote,
and
we'll
call
it
a
convention,
and
only
white
people
can
vote.
that,
in
your
opinion,
the
voting
rights
act
just
doesn't
cover,
and
that's
what
i
can't
quite
understand,
why
the
people
who
would
have
written
this
voting
rights
act
would
have
wanted
not
to
cover
that
possible
situation,
since
it
did
exist
many
years
ago.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
they
didn't
want
to
cover
the
possibility
that
the
democratic
party
in
the
south,
or
the
republican
party,
would
say,
oh,
we
no
longer
can
insist
only
whites
vote
at
the
primary,
so
what
we'll
do
is,
we'll
do
exactly
the
same
thing
but
call
it
a
convention.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
they
didn't
want
to
cover
that
obvious
situation,
despite
terry
v....
you
know,
the
cases
that
seem
quite
similar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
the
evidence
that
they
didn't
want
to
cover
it,
even
though
there
was
a
supreme
court
case
right
on
point
which
said
that
it
was
covered
under
the
constitution,
the
evidence
that
they
didn't
want
to
cover
it
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
what
they've
done
is,
the
political
party
is
simply
going
to
go
do
just
what
they
did
before,
but
they
won't
call
it
a
primary
because
they
won't
use
a
voting
machine.
they'll
all
go
to
a
room
some
place,
anyone
who
wants
to,
and
they'll
raise
their
hands.
okay,
i'm
saying,
do
you
think...
is
your
argument
that
congress
lacks
the
constitutional
power
to
do
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--forbid
that,
yes
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
here...
you
keep
saying
preferred
position--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
republicans
or
the
democrats.
precisely
what
does
that
consist
of?
