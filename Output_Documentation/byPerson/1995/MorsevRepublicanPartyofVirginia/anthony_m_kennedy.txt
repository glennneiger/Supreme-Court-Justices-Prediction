well,
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision,
and
it
seems
to
me
in
light
of
the
two
cases
justice
ginsburg
mentioned,
terry
v.
adams
and
smith
v.
allwright,
that
you
have
a
difficult
position
to
maintain.
the
congress
was
well
aware
of
those
cases.
they
were
well
aware
of
the
white
primary
cases,
and
yet
they
used
the
words,
state
and
political
subdivision.
they
didn't
say,
or
any
other
entity
which
is
a
state
actor--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
that's
what
you
want...
and
you
want
us
to
say
the
latter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
assuming
that
state
action
cases
are
correct.
the
point
is,
is
that
this
jurisprudence
was
in
front
of
the
congress,
and
they
chose
this
rather
limited
language.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
question
about
that,
but
those
cases
did
not
purport
to
be
interpreting
this
language.
this
statute
was
later
enacted,
and
they
did
not
focus
on
the
words,
state
or
political
subdivision.
they
talked
about
state
action,
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
rationale
that
you're
offering
to
us
now
that
the
delegated
power,
the
preferred
position,
is
that
what
makes
it
a
political
subdivision
under
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
what
makes
it
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
the
term
state
is
coterminous
with
our
state
action
jurisprudence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
then,
would
this
45
fee
stand
on
the
same
level
as,
say,
the
requirement
of
passing
a
literacy
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
the
difference
in
that
and
a
literacy
test
is
that
yours
is
a
more
reasonable
requirement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we're
asking
about
whether
or
not
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
hypothetical
literacy
test
is
subject
to
challenge
under
either
the
act
or
the
constitution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
you
say
with
reference
to
the
scope
and
the
meaning
of
the
defined
term,
voting,
in
section
14?
voting
is
defined
as
all
action
necessary
to
make
a
vote
effective
in
any
primary.
would
you--
