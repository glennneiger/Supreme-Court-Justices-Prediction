john
paul
stevens
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
number
94
203,
morse
v.
the
republican
party
of
virginia.
you
may
proceed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
the
virginia
statutes
draw
a
distinction
between
new
parties
such
as
justice
scalia's
feminist
party,
and
established
parties
like
the
republican
party
and
the
democratic
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
difference
under
virginia
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
getchell.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question?
do
you
think
the
case
of
terry
v.
adams,
the
jaybird
case,
is
still
good
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
do
you
do...
and
the
word
involved
there
was
state,
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
why
is
the
word
state
narrower
or
broader
in
the
constitution
than
it
is
in
the
statute
which
was
enacted
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
cite
the
professor's
article,
but
which
opinion
that
was
written
in
that
case
supports
your
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
your
position
be
different
in
this
case
if
virginia
was
a
one
party
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
your
construction
of
the
voting
rights
act,
the
statute,
be
different
if
we
only
had
a
democratic
party
over
10
percent
in
any
election?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking
about
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
shown
that
there's
only
one
party
that
has
more
than
10
percent
of
the
vote.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
would
the
statute
cover
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
how
can
the
regulation
cover
it,
if
the
statute
doesn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
has
the
attorney
general's
regulation
been
on
the
books?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
i
don't
know
why
you'd
say
it's
unexpected,
because
this
comes
right
within
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--apparently
there
are
1,000
different
submissions
that
didn't
find
it
that
unexpected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
getchell.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
karlan,
you
have
5
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
