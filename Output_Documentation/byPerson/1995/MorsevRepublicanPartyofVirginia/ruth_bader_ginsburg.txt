ms.
karlan,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question...
at
least,
i
think
it's
preliminary
to
that.
the
section
that
you're
dealing
with
speaks
of
"whenever
a
state
or
a
political
subdivision.
"
it
seems
to
be
addressed
to
a
state
or
a
political
unit
of
a
state.
how,
then,
can
you
proceed
under
section
5
against
a
political
party?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
can
see
that...
you...
you're
referring
to
constitutional...
decisions
under
the
constitution
like
terry
and
smith
v.
allwright,
but
here
we
have
a
statute,
and
the
statute
addresses
state
or
political
subdivisions.
is
there
any
definition
of
those
words
in
the
statute
itself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
so
if
we
had
a
45
fee
for
a
primary,
that
would
be
subject
to
preclearance,
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
the
convention,
as
i
understand
it,
is
effectively
a
substitute
for
the
primary,
they
both
serve
the
same
function
in
selecting
candidates
who
will
appear
in
preferred
positions
on
the
ballot,
the
function
is
identical,
is
it
not?
then
why
shouldn't
the
coverage
be
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
preprimary?
what
about
the
jaybird
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
disregard
the
attorney
general's
rejection
of
that
interpretation?
i
thought
the
attorney
general's
interpretation
were,
things
close
to
the
election
of
candidates
like
the
45
fee
were
covered
but
things
remote,
like
the
time
and
the
place
of
meeting,
like
the
formulation
of
the
party's
platform,
were
not
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
do
you
say
they
make
that
contention?
