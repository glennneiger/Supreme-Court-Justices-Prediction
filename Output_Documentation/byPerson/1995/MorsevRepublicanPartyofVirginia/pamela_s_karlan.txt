ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
thank
you.
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
requires
a
preclearing
method
of
nominating
candidates
for
the
united
states
senate
that
restricts
the
right
to
vote
to
persons
who
give
45.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
if
you
don't
pay
45,
you
have
absolutely
no
say
in
how
the
republican
nominee
for
senate
in
virginia
is
selected.
section
5
requires
the
preclearance
of
all
voting
standards,
practices
or
procedures,
or
prerequisites
to
voting,
no
matter
how
small
the
change,
and
was
enacted
to
keep
states
and
political
parties
from
denying
the
recently
won
gains
in
registration
under
the
voting
rights
act.
in
presley
v.
etowah
county
commission,
this
court
reaffirmed
the
broad
scope
of
section
5,
and
identified
once
again
a
series
of
categories
or
typologies
of
case
which
require
preclearance,
and
under
the
facts
alleged
in
our
complaint,
this
case
falls
within
two
of
those
typologies.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
your
honor,
they
were
properly
presented
below.
as
your
honor
knows,
this
case
came
up
on
an
expedited
schedule
with
no
discovery
permitted
to
the
plaintiffs.
the
result
was
that
we
found
out
when
we
received
the
affidavit
of
david
johnson
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
that
the
republican
party
had
switched
from
a
primary
to
a
convention,
and
that
this
fee
effective...
this
fee
would
only
be
possible
were
that
change
in
there.
we
then
raised
that
issue
at
oral
arguments--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor,
it
was
not
part
of
our
complaint.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
under
our
complaint,
the
facts
of
which
must
be
taken
as
true
for
these
purposes,
we
alleged
that
this
was
in
effect
a
primary
election
itself,
because
as
we
alleged,
and
the
district
court
assumed,
anyone
who
pays
45
is
entitled
to
go
and
cast
a
vote
for
a
nominee.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
your
honor,
it
did.
it
held
that
nothing
connected
with
the
convention
required
preclearance,
not
the
imposition
of
a
fee,
not
the
rules
governing
who
could
attend,
and
not
the
decision
under
section--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it
said,
your
honor,
that
nothing
connected
with
the
convention,
including
implicitly
the
decision
to
hold
one,
is
covered--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor,
but
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
15,
we
were
entitled
to
conform
the
pleadings
to
the
proof,
and
had
this
case
not
been
done
in
the
expedited
manner
in
which
it
was
done,
we
could
have
amended
the
complaint.
now,
under
rule
15,
the
failure
to
amend
the
complaint
need
not
keep
the
court
from
reaching
that
issue.
if
this
court
concludes
that
that's
the
central
question,
and
that
that
issue
wasn't
sufficiently
developed,
then
the
proper
response
from
the
court
would
be
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
granting
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
in
which
that
issue
can
be
expressly
litigated.
now,
there
are
two
theories
of
section
5
alleged
in
the
complaint
under
which,
under
the
text
of
the
voting
rights
act,
this
practice
is
covered.
the
first
of
these
is
that
the
republican
party's
practices
here,
given
the
facts
alleged,
constitute
a
primary
in
and
of
themselves.
a
primary
election,
after
all,
is
an
election
in
which
individual
voters
who
are
adherents
of
a
political
party
nominate
a
candidate
by
casting
ballots.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
justice
ginsburg,
a
political
party
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
a
state
actor
in
the
same
way
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
by
its
terms
simply
guarantees
the
right
to
vote
against
abridgement
or
denial
by
a
state,
and
has
been
held
to
cover
political
parties
when
they're
engaged
in
the
public
nominating
function.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
there
is
no
definition
of
state
in
the
statute
itself,
your
honor.
the
statute
was
by
its
terms
specifically
enacted
to
enforce
the
guarantees
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
thereby
it
seems
clear
from
the
legislative
history
intended
to
reach
political
parties
as
well.
for
example,
we
cite
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
the
statement
from
the
house
subcommittee
of
the
judiciary
that
was
responsible
for
the
hearings
on
section
5
stating
directly
an
election
of
delegates
to
a
state
party
convention
is
covered,
and
a
statement
by
representative
bingham,
the
author
of
the
language
defining
the
term
14(c)(1),
making
clear
that
party
canvases
and
caucuses
that
selected
people
who
were
involved
in
the
nomination
of
candidates
to
public
office
were
covered
by
the
act
because
they
were
state
actors.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
your
honor,
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
would
not
cover
the
decision
to
form
a
party
as
discriminatory
on
the
basis
of
race,
but
the
nineteenth
amendment--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--the
nineteenth
amendment,
your
honor,
would
say
that
if
that
party
performs
the
public
electoral
function
of
nominating
a
candidate
for
united
states
senator,
they
would
be
covered
by
the
constitution.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
justice
stevens,
but--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--under
virginia
law,
a
political
party
within
the
meaning
of
the
virginia
statute
only
comes
into
being
if
at
one
of
the
last
two
statewide
general
elections
some
candidate
of
that
party
received
10
percent
of
the
votes
cast
for
statewide
office,
so
that
the
party
to
which
justice
scalia
refers
would
not
itself
be
covered.
however--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--ultimately,
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
under
the
nineteenth
amendment,
which
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor,
which
says
that
no
state
shall
abridge
or
deny
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
sex.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
but--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--well,
but
justice
kennedy,
the
provision
under
which
the
exclusions
in
terry
and
in
smith
v.
allwright
were
found
discriminatory
was
a
provision
that
only
applied
to
the
states,
so
congress
could
reasonably
assume
that
if
it
was
state
action
for
a
political
party
to
bar
someone
from
a
preprimary
in
which
there
was
no
governmental
involvement
whatsoever--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor,
this
language
is
not
limited.
this
is
the
same
language
under
which
the
courts
held
that
political
parties
were
covered.
now,
your
honor--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor.
in
united
states
v.
classic,
the
case
on
which
both
smith
and
terry
rely,
the
court
said
that
the
primary
was
an
integral
part
of
the
election
process
whether
it
always,
sometimes,
or
never
resulted
in
the
election
of
a
candidate.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
draw
a
historical
point
not
in
the
record,
in
1965,
the
states
that
were
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act
were
all
states
in
the
solid
south,
which
was
solidly
democratic.
had
congress
passed
a
law
with
the
understanding
that
you
have
advanced,
one
that
didn't
apply
to
political
parties,
it
is
patently
clear
that
the
voting
rights
act
would
have
been
strangled
at
its
birth,
because
all
of
the
discrimination
would
simply
have
been
conducted
by
the
democratic
party
in
the
south,
and
the
voting
rights
act
would
have
been
a
dead
letter.
now,
it's
clear
that
that's
so
from
both
the
statement
in
the
house
report
and
representative
bingham's
statement
of
what
the
language
involving
voting
was
intended
to
cover.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
believe
that
they
are
all
valid,
yes,
your
honor,
and
they
do
provide
that
when
political
parties
perform
the
state--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--they
certainly
support
our
case,
but
even
if
those
regulations
were
invalid,
our
case
would
go
forward,
because
our
claim
is
that
this
is
a
primary
election
in
the
same
way
that
the
behavior
in
terry
is
a
primary--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
would
hope
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
our
position
depends
on
the
attorney
general's
regulations.
his
regulations
are
based
on
the
same
understanding
which
we
have
advanced,
which
is
that
state
action
covers
a
political
party
when
it's
engaged
in
the
process
of
nominating
a
candidate
for
public
office.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
your
honor,
i
only
have
the
list
of
the
number
of
times
where
objections
were
lodged,
and
that
was
about
a
dozen.
there's
a
citation
to
the
turner
affidavit
by
the
assistant
attorney
general.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that
was
in
1982,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
that
was--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor,
that's
a
list
of
all
of
the
objections
imposed
as
of
the
date
1982,
not
objections
in
the
year
1982.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
the
reason
it's
in
there,
justice
souter,
is
because
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
only
applies
to
particular
places.
sometimes
those
places
are
entire
states,
but
in
some
cases,
like
north
carolina
or
new
york,
only
particular
political
subdivisions,
only
particular
geographic
regions--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--are
covered
by
the
statute
at
all.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
so
if
you
only
provided
no
state,
it
wouldn't
define,
for
example,
the
preclearance
cases
that
this
court
has
seen
from
north
carolina
or
from
new
york,
ujo
v.
carey,
for--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor.
it's
not
fair
to
define
state
action
here
to
define
which
geographic
areas
of
the
country
are
covered,
because
if
you
only
said
state,
then
that
wouldn't
explain
why,
for
example,
a
change
in
electoral
rules
in
manhattan
is
covered
but
not
a
change
in
westchester
county.
that's
when
the
triggering
provisions--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
correct.
the
triggering
provisions
of
section
4
identify
political
subdivisions
for
purposes
of
deciding
what's
covered
by
preclearance,
not
for
purposes
of
deciding
what
the
standard
is,
or
whom
the
actor
is.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
because
they
are
not
exercising
a
delegated
state
function,
as
the
virginia
republicans
are
under
section
509(b)
in
this
case.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
i
begin
with
one
observation
about
what
mr.
getchell
has
told
you
today,
which
is,
he
tells
you
how
the
republicans
run
their
convention
in
virginia,
and
how
much
it
would
cost,
and
how
it
should
be
operated,
and
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
preclear.
those
issues
are
not
before
this
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
if
his
argument
depends
on
what
the
virginia
republican
party
actually
does,
then
the
appropriate
judgment
from
this
court
is
a
reversal
and
remand
so
that
we
can
conduct
discovery
on
what
the
virginia
party
actually
does.
the
second
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
word
state
is,
of
course,
ambiguous.
it
depends
on
a
construction
of
state
that
draws
on
the
fifteenth
amendment
cases
which
the
voting
rights
act
was
intended
to
enforce.
it
understands
what
state
action
was,
which
is
when
political
parties
conduct
their
public
nominating
function.
it
relies
on
the
department
of
justice's
regulations,
which
this
court
has
always
given
great
deference
to.
the
third
point
is
about
freedom
of
association.
justice
scalia,
your
arguments
would
depend...
would
be
equally
strong
in
the
context
of
a
primary
election.
if
the
republican
party
wanted
to
hold
a
primary
election
restricted
to
party
members,
and
limit
party
membership
to
white
voters
only,
then
your
argument
would
say
they
have
that
entitlement.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that
might
be
correct,
but
your
honor,
the
freedom
of
association
point
might
be
the
same
even
if
they
did,
and
this
court
clearly
has
never
taken
that
broad
an
approach.
moreover--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--that's
correct.
now,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
freedom
of
association
claim,
really,
because
if
you
look
at
the
republican
call
for
the
convention
contained
in
the
joint
appendix,
they
allow
all
voters
to
participate.
the
only
point
they
make
is
that
they
have
some
kind
of
interest
in
charging
the
45.
that
may
be
so,
but
that
interest
will
only
be
trenched
on
by
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
if
the
department
of
justice,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
or
this
court,
concludes
that
that
practice
of
charging
the
45
has
the
purpose
or
effect
of
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race.
at
this
point,
their
claim
has
to
be
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
make
people
pay
even
if
that
excluded
all
black
voters,
or
a
disproportionate
number
of
black
voters.
again,
that
is
the
issue
to
be
determined
in
preclearance.
they
have
no
first
amendment
right
that
they
have
identified
that
would
be
trenched
on
by
requiring
preclearance
in
this
case
of
this
fee.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that's
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
that
runs
a
primary
election--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--and
that
receives--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--and
receives
a
place
on
the
ballot
above
all
other
parties?
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
what
i
do
know
in
this
case
is
that
section
509(b)--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--i
would
have
to
know
what
the
state
involvement
in
that
political
party's
placement
on
the
ballot
is,
and
i
don't
know
what
that
is,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
under
section
24.2
613
of
the
virginia
code,
political
parties
receive
placement
on
the
ballot
above...
lexically
above
all
other
candidates,
and
as
mr.
bender
referred,
there's
a
function
called
roll
off,
which
means
as
you
move
down
the
ballot,
fewer
and
fewer
people
are
still
voting,
and
it
turns
out
that
being
the
number
1
candidate
or
number
2
candidate
on
a
ballot
gives
you
some
substantial
bump
up
in
the
number
of
votes
you
receive.
that's
the
preferential
position.
the
second
preferential
aspect
is
that
the
parties
need
not
show
that
this
candidate
has
any
particular
level
of
support,
whereas
any
independent
candidate,
or
nonparty
candidate
running,
must
both
gain
a
percentage
of
the
registered
voters
as
signatories
and
have
those
people
spread
across
the
commonwealth.
i
think
the
number,
if
you
multiply
it
out
right
now,
is
about
15,000
signatures--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--so
that's
more
difficult
as
well.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
no,
that
was
the
end
of
that.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
yes,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
the
virginia
republican
nomination
process
is
pervasively
regulated
and
results
in
the
party
receiving
preferential
treatment.
the
pervasive
regulation--
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
--it's
not
necessary
to
our
case.
it
buttresses
our
case.
ms.
pamela
s.
karlan
we
would...
thank
you.
