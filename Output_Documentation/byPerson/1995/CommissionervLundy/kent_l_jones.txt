mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
tax
court
is
an
article
i
court
of
limited
jurisdiction.
this
case
concerns
the
limitations
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court
to
award
refunds.
when
a
taxpayer
commences
a
suit
in
tax
court
to
review
an
asserted
deficiency,
the
court
may
then
also
determine
whether
an
overpayment
was
made.
section
6512(b)(3)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
however,
provides
three
detailed
jurisdictional
limits
on
the
amount
of
the
refund
that
the
court
may
award.
under
section
6512(b)(3)(a),
the
court
may
award
amounts
paid
after
the
notice
of
deficiency
is
issued.
under
6512(b)(3)(c),
the
court
may
award
amounts
for
which
a
claim
for
refund
was
made
before
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
issued,
but
when,
as
in
this
case,
there
was
neither
subsequent
payment
or
a
prior
refund
claim,
section
6512(b)(3)(b),
which
this
case
concerns,
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court
to
award
amounts
that
would
be
refundable
under
6511(b)(2)
if
on
the
date
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
issued
a
claim
for
refund
had
been
filed.
in
turn,
6511(b)(2)
allows
a
refund
of
amounts
paid
within
3
years
prior
to
the
claim
for
refund
only
if
the
claim
for
refund
was
made
within
3
years
from
the
time
of
the
taxpayer's
return,
but
when--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's...
what
it
means
is
that,
whether
or
not
a
claim
for
refund
had
actually
been
filed,
the
court
is
to
apply
these
statutes
as
if
a
claim
for
refund
was
filed
on
that
date.
that
was...
no
one
has
doubted,
i
think,
that
that
is
the
meaning
of
that
provision.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
in
this
case,
because
the
taxpayer
had
failed
to
file
a
return
before
the
date
of
the
notice
of
deficiency,
6512(b)(3)(b)
operates,
and
what
it
operates
to
do
is
to
require
the
court
to
apply
6511(b)(2)
as
if
a
claim
for
refund
was
filed
on
the
date
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
issued.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
it...
subsection
(c)
applies
if
a
claim
had
been
filed
before
that
date.
subsection
(b)
says
you
are
to
assume
a
claim
is
filed
on
that
date,
whether
or
not
one
had
been
filed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
it
might
put
it
that
way
is
because
if
you
read
the
rest
of
subsection
(b)
it
goes
on
to
say,
a
claim
based
upon
whatever
grounds
the
tax
court
determined
an
overpayment
was
made.
now,
what
that
refers
to
is
a
basic
distinction
between
district
court
and
tax
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
district
court
only
has
jurisdiction
to
consider
a
judicial
claim
that
is
based
upon
precisely
the
administrative
claim.
if
there's
any
material
variance
between
the
district
court
claim
and
the
administrative
claim,
the
district
court
claim
has
no
jurisdiction,
but
in
the
tax
court
there
is
no
requirement
of
an
administrative
claim.
the
court
may
award
a
refund
based
upon
any
ground
for
which
it
determines
an
overpayment.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it...
the
taxpayer
has
a
broader
refund
argument
in
the
tax
courts.
he
has
whatever
argument
he
can
come
up
with,
but
the
price
that
is
paid
is
that
the
amount
of
refund
that
can
be
awarded
is
subject
to
the
very
specific
and
detailed
jurisdiction
provisions--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--he
could
have
filed
a
return,
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
the
right
answer
to
your
question
is
that
courts
have
routinely
held
that
refund
claims
can
be
submitted
informally,
that
they
don't
have
to
be
on
a
return--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--there
are...
there
isn't
an
internal
revenue
form
that,
of
course,
is
exactly
what
you've
described,
a
return
that
includes
a
claim
for
refund.
there's
also--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
would
be
the
amended
return
form.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
an
amended
return.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
sir,
i'm
sorry,
i
must
disagree.
the
courts
have
routinely
held
that
you
can
file
a
refund
claim
informally.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there's
no
irs
form,
but
there
is...
but
you
don't
have
to
use
an
irs
form
to
make
a
refund
claim,
according
to
the
courts.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
they
went
to
the
irs,
the
irs
would
probably
ask
him
to
file
a
return--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--which
this
taxpayer
hasn't
done.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
a
substituted
return
is...
it's
lingo,
if
you'll
pardon
the
expression.
it
is
not
a
return.
a
substituted
return
is
simply
an
internal
document
that
the
irs
prepares
to
set
forth
their
calculations
based
upon
what
they
think
the
taxpayer's
liability
is.
the
return
that
6511
refers
to
is
specifically
the
return
filed
by
the
taxpayer.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
it
would--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
cannot
be
the
taxpayer's
return.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
isn't
sent
to
the
taxpayer.
what's
sent
to
the
taxpayer
is
the
notice
of
deficiency,
which
includes
the
calculations.
whether
the
taxpayer
can
see
the
underlying
basis
for
it,
i
don't
have
any
doubt
that
they
can
see
it,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it's
routinely
sent.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
can't
say
definitively.
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
know,
but
what
i
am
confident
about
is
that
this
thing
that
we
call
a
substituted
return
is
not
a
return
of
the
taxpayer,
it
is
simply...
for
example,
a
taxpayer,
we
might
have
a
w-2.
it
might
show
some
information
about
income
and
withholdings.
that
might
have
been
all
that
we
know.
for
example,
that
might
have
been
all
that
we
know
in
this
case,
and
based
upon
that
limited
knowledge,
we
"prepare
a
substituted
return",
but
what
we're
really
doing
is
filling
in
the
blanks
as
best
we
know.
the
definition
of
a
return
in
the
code
i
think
is
best
described
in
6611(h),
which
talks
about
a
return
in
processable
form.
a
return...
it
must
be
a
document
filed
by
the
taxpayer
that
purports
to
be
a
return,
and
that
contains
all
of
the
information
from
which
the
taxpayer's
entire
liability--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--a
claim
for
refund
has
been
defined
judicially.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
familiar
with
a
definition
of
a
claim
for
refund
in
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
justice--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
sir,
i
didn't.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
did
not
say
that.
the
courts
have
held
quite
clearly
that
you
can
file
a
claim
informally,
and
you
don't
have
to
use
a
return,
and
let
me
be
specific,
a
claim
for
refund--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--absolutely.
a
claim
for
refund--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief
we
cite
the
salzman
treatise,
which
elaborates
a
lot
of
cases
that
deal
with
this
subject.
a
claim
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
absolutely
correct.
the
statute
makes
the
distinction
between
taxpayers
who
have
been
delinquent
in
filing
returns
and
taxpayers
who
have
not,
and
by
its
very
words
it
provides
an
abbreviated
period
of
recovery
for
taxpayers
who
have
not
filed
a
return
before
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
issued.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
applies
whenever--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
applies
routinely
when
the
taxpayer
has
not
filed
a
return
before
the
notice
of
deficiency
is
issued.
that
would
be
the...
you
only
get
the
3-year
look
back
if
you
have
filed
the
return
before
the
claim
for
refund
arises.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there's
a
long
answer
to
that
question
which
i'd
like
to
give,
and
i'd
like
to
try
to
give
it
in
a
logical
order.
the
first
part
of
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
has
the
government
been
consistent
about
tax
court
cases,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
plainly
yes.
since
1957,
in
revenue
ruling
57-354,
which
is
quoted
at
page
48
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
commissioner
has
stated
that
the
status
of
a
claim
for
refund
must
be
determined
as
of
the
time
it
is
filed
and
that
if,
as
the
time
it
is
filed,
no
return
has
then
been
filed,
you
only
get
a
2-year
look
back
period.
the
tax
court
has
consistently
reached
the
same
conclusion
under
its
own
jurisdiction
since
the
early
1970's.
the
suggestion
that
our
position
in
this
case
is
newly
minted
simply
ignores
this
historical
record,
and
moreover,
factually,
the
suggestion
of
respondent
that
we
would
routinely
pay
refund
claims
in
this
context
is
demonstrably
incorrect,
as
the
tax
court
found,
because
6512(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
says
that
if
a
notice
of
deficiency
is
issued,
and
the
taxpayer
files
a
claim
in
tax
court,
then
no
refund
or
credit
shall
be
allowed
except
as
the
tax
court
determines,
so
in
tax
court
cases
the
commissioner
has
no
administrative
authority
to
award
a
refund.
we
are
deprived
of
it
by
statute.
now,
the
question
that
you're
really,
i
think,
focusing
on
is,
have
we
been
the
same
about
district
court
cases
and
tax
court
cases,
and
i
think...
there's
a
short
answer
to
that
and
a
long
explanation.
the
short
answer
is,
it
is
not
perfectly
clear
whether
in
each
and
every
situation
the
refund
periods
are
supposed
to
be
the
same
in
district
court
and
tax
court
cases,
and
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that
congress
intended
them
to
always
be
the
same,
and
i'd
like
to
explain
the
latter
part
first.
there's
no
reason
to
think
congress
necessarily
intended
the
same
periods
always
to
apply
in
district
court
and
tax
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
that
you've
accurately
described
the
facts,
justice
ginsburg,
but
i
also
believe
that
the
commissioner
raising
the
defense
in
this
case
is
something
that
he
has...
she,
in
this
case,
has
consistently
done
since
the
issue
has
been
presented.
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
a
delay
in
it's
assertion
in
this
case--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
is...
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it's
relatively
common
for
defenses
to
be
amended,
for
answers
to
be
amended,
and
i
would
hope
the
court
wouldn't
draw
any
inference
from
that
in
this
case.
there's
really
no
reason
to.
i
mean,
as
i
emphasized
just
a
point
ago,
we
don't
have
authority
to
make
a
refund
in
a
tax
court
case
unless
the
tax
court
has
determined
an
overpayment,
so
we
have
to...
when
we
think
a
refund
might
be
appropriate,
we
have
to
submit
an
agreed
order
that
falls
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court.
it
may
have
been...
and
i'm
speculating
here.
it
may
have
been
that
in
preparing
a
draft
of
some
kind
of
agreed
order
to
submit
in
this
case,
that
it
then
occurred
to
counsel,
oh,
wait
a
minute,
this
case
isn't
within
the
tax
court's
jurisdiction.
it
may
be
that
that's
the
mechanics
that
led
to
this
being
asserted
at
the
time
that
it
was.
now--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens,
i
cannot
tell
you,
as
i
stand
here,
which
of
those
cases
might
involve
those
facts,
but
i
would
like--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
would
think
they
might
well,
and
i
would
be
speculating,
but
let
me
point
out,
because
you
seem...
this
is
something
important
to
you,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
it.
congress
wrote
this
statute.
congress
wrote
it
anticipating
that
there
would
be
situations
where
claims
for
refund
were
filed
at
a
time
when
no
return
had
been
filed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
know
that
because
section
6511
(a)
provides
a
limited
look
back
for
situations
where
the
claim
for
refund
is
filed
at
a
time
that
no
return
had
been
filed.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
so
congress
anticipated
that
claims
for
refund
could,
in
fact,
be
filed
where
no
return
had
been
filed,
and
provided
for
a
2-year
look
back
period
and,
in
fact,
that's
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absolutely.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
the
claim
for
refund
and
the
return
were
filed
simultaneously--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--which
they
often
are.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
most...
ordinarily
may
be,
but
certainly
or
not
necessarily
required--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
stevens,
if
we
were
to
assume
that
a
claim
for
refund
and
a
return
was
the
same
thing,
then
very
little--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
justice--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
this
is
such
a
case.
congress
imputed
the
claim
for
refund,
but
setting
that
aside,
justice
stevens,
frankly
you
would
have
to
write
out
almost
all
of
6511(a)
to
support
that
view,
because
first
of
all
the
second
clause
of
the
first
sentence
of
6511(a)
said
that,
and
if
the
claim
for
refund
is
filed
at
a
time
when
no
return
has
been
filed,
then
you
get
a
2-year
look
back
period.
so
to
suggest...
i
mean,
you
can't
suggest
that
congress
didn't
think
that
a
claim
for
refund
and
a
return
were
independent
documents
that
could
be
filed
in
different
orders.
congress
clearly
contemplated
that,
and
clearly
also
provided
an
abbreviated
period,
an
abbreviated
look
back
period
for
the
taxpayer
who
fails
to
file
the
return
before
he
files
the
refund
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
reason
that
we
see
is
that
section
6512(b)(3)
provides
a
detailed
set
of
answers
to
these
questions.
it
says
that
you
can
base
a
refund
on
a
refund
claim
filed
before--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--6512(b)(3)(c)
says
that
you
can
award
a
refund
based
upon
a
prior
refund
claim
filed
before
a
notice
of
deficiency.
6512(b)(3)(b)
says
you
can
award
a
refund
based
upon
a
claim
assumed
to
arise
on
the
date
of
the
notice
of
deficiency.
there
is
no
basis
for
engrafting
onto
this
statute
an
additional
refund
jurisdiction
for
subsequent
refund
claims,
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
theories
would
require.
you'd
have
to
be
adding
a
clause
to
the
statute,
and
you'd
be
adding
a
clause
to
the
statute
that
would
contradict
the
clauses
that
would
already
exist.
now,
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions
that
the
jurisdictional
limitations
on
refunds
are
limited
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
that
must
be
strictly
applied
and
strictly
adhered
to
by
the
judiciary.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
it
was
not
applying
the
statute
as
congress
wrote
it.
the
court
said,
we
will
not
use
the
imputed
refund
claim
under
6512(b)(3)(b)
to
decide
whether
a
2-year
or
3-year
look
back
period
applies,
but
that
is
precisely
what
congress
told
them
to
do.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'd
like
to
try
to
briefly
describe
that,
because
time
is
limited.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
they
have
to
be
the
same.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court
and
the
district
court
have
always
been
different.
the
district
court
had
a
common
law
jurisdiction
to
award
refunds
against
the
collector,
had
a
statutory
authority,
ultimately
had
a
statutory
authority
to
award
claims
against
the
united
states
long
before
the
tax
court
came
into
existence,
and
when
the
tax
court
came
into
existence,
it
was
only
allowed
as
an
administrative
wing
in
the
treasury
department
to
review
the
notice
of
deficiency.
it
couldn't
even
talk
about
overpayments
until
1928,
and
it
wasn't
until
1988,
just
7
years
ago,
that
the
tax
court
was
allowed
to
enter
an
order
requiring
that
a
refund
be
made.
moreover,
as
i've
already
described,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
is
different,
even
as
we
stand
here,
because
of
the
variance
of
the
claim
doctrine,
and
so
there's
no
reason
to
assume,
ab
initio,
that
in
establishing
or
in
merging
these
disparate
jurisdictions,
that...
and
in
using
the
terminology
that
is
peculiar
to
tax
court
litigation
in
doing
so,
that
you're
always
going
to
reach
the
same
result.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
at
most,
it's
odd--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
either
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
don't
think
so.
it's
not
a
race.
i
don't
want
you
to
ever
think
it's
a
race.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
let
me
explain
why...
because
they
don't
have
to
go
to
tax
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
there's
an
answer
to
the
last
part
of
your
point,
and
that's
what
i'd
like
to
address.
in
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
miller
case,
the
court
concluded
that
these
refund
periods
were
identical
in
district
court
and
tax
court
cases.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
think
that
they
are
obviously
wrong.
i
think
that
they
make
a
textual
point,
and
i
need
to
argue
both
sides
of
this,
and
i
want
to
explain
that
at
the
beginning,
because
my
point
is,
the
essential
point
is,
it
doesn't
matter.
it
isn't
critical.
what's
critical
in
this
case
is,
what
is
the
tax
court's
jurisdiction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
and
our
first
point
is
that
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
there's
symmetry
when
both
the
history
and
the
text
of
the
provisions
is
not
symmetrical...
are
not
symmetrical.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
oh,
i
see.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
subsequent
return
would
not
affect
the
prior
refund
claim.
it
wouldn't
validate
the
timing
of
the
prior
refund
claim.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
because
the
statute
says
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
what
the
richards
court
said--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is
correct.
but
let
me--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--hypothetically,
and
then
we'd
have
the
problem
that
miller
addresses,
and
the
only
thing
i
want
to
say
about
miller
in
the
brief
time
that's
remaining
is
that
the
service
has
ruled
to
the
contrary
about
district
court
cases
that
even
a
late
return
might
allow
a
3-year
look
back
period
in
the
district
court,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
that
ruling
doesn't
explain
its
analysis.
we
don't
know,
in
reading
it,
whether
it's
based
upon
a
textual
analysis
or
upon
administrative
grace.
we
don't
have
administrative
grace
in
tax
court
cases.
that's
another
difference
between
tax
court
and
district
court
cases.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
on
the
facts
of
that
ruling.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
don't...
i'm
sorry.
i
believe
in
miller
the
return
was
filed
more
than
2
but
less
than
3
years
after
its
due
date,
whereas
in
the
ruling
it
involved
a
return
filed
more
than
3
years
after
its
due
date.
these
are
very...
the
intricacies
of
the
intertwining
of
these
provisions
are
complicated.
i
just
want
to
end
by
explaining
once
again
that
on
this
court's
decisions,
what
we
should
look
at
is
the
jurisdictional
provisions
of
the
tax
court.
they
should
not
be
amended,
they
should
be
enforced,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--what
we
did
do
was,
90
days
before
we
issued
the
notice
of
deficiency--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we
told
him
that
we
were
about
to.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
tax
court
opinions
on
this
are
of
long
standing,
justice
stevens.
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--hypothetically,
he
could
have
protected
himself.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
justice
stevens,
i
have
to
answer
that
question
yes,
because
obviously
we
would
have
discretion
to
tell
every
taxpayer
everything
we
know,
if
we
had
the
time.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
the
principal
contention
that
respondent
raises
here
was
not
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
has
not
been
accepted
by
any
court.
that
contention
is
that
a
claim
for
refund
and
a
return
are
synonymous
concepts.
congress
plainly
didn't
intend
that.
they
use
the
terms
quite
distinctly
and
separately.
they
make
the
periods
of
limitation
and
the
refund
periods
depend
upon
which
came
first
and
how
long
apart
they
were,
so
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
respondent
seeks
would
literally
make
nonsense
out
of
6511(a),
6511(b),
and
6512(b).
no
court
has
supported
that
assertion.
the
suggestion
that
somehow
this
problem
would
be
cured
if
the
respondent
could
have
filed
a
timely
claim
is
simply
off
the
point.
a
taxpayer
can
always
file
a
claim
for
refund
at
any
time,
but
that
doesn't
alter
the
limitations
that
apply
when
the
refund
claim
is
filed.
for
example,
in
this
case,
if
they
had
filed...
if
respondent
had
filed
a
refund
claim
on
the
date
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
issued,
he
would
have
been
limited
to
the
2-year
refund
period,
because
as
of
that
date
he
had
filed
no
return.
respondent
simply
ignores
what's
the
principal
dilemma
that
he
faces.
that
is,
that
he
was
delinquent
in
filing
his
return,
and
congress
made
that
delinquency
relevant
in
determining
the
refund
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
i
could
answer
yes
or
no--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
scalia,
i
certainly
would.
i
have
to
admit,
i
don't
know.
i
have
looked
at
6512(a).
it
doesn't
say.
it
simply
says
that
when
you
have
this
tax
court
case,
no
other
court
can
decide
whether
there's
a
refund,
and
neither
can
the
commissioner.
it
doesn't
say
whether
that
case
could
be
dismissed
and
a
subsequent
case
filed.
it's
possible
the
commissioner
has
taken
a
position
on
that,
so
i'm
reluctant
to
make
an
argument
on
it
not
knowing
what
position
we
may
have
taken.
thank
you
very
much.
