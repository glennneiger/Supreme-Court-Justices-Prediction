david
h.

why
does
it
say,
whether
or
not,
since
subsection
(c)
covers
the
case
in
which
it
had
been
filed
before
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
didn't
it
just
say
that
it
wasn't,
or
if
it
wasn't?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
that
respect
the
taxpayer
is
better
off
to
be
in
the
tax
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
you've
given
us
an
example
of
symmetry,
of
a
symmetry
in
the
taxpayer's
favor
in
the
tax
court--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
answered
my
question.
may
i
ask
you
another
technical
question
which
probably
doesn't
matter
either,
but
if
the
taxpayer
had
let
2
years
go
but
had
filed
no
return,
more
than
2
years
had
passed
since
the
last
tax
payment,
then
made
an
administrative
claim
and
followed
that
by
going
into
the
district
court,
he
would
be
in
exactly
the
same
position
he's
in
here,
wouldn't
he?
he'd
be
out.
he
couldn't...
he
couldn't
file
his
claim
in
the
district
court,
and
then
say,
oh,
wait
a
minute,
i
forgot
to
file
a
return--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
then
file
a
return
and
get
the
3-year
period.
on
your
reading
he'd
be
just
as
stuck
as
he
is
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
the
reading
of
the,
within
3
years
from--
justice
david
h.
souter
so
he'd
be
in
the
same
boat,
in
my
hypo,
in
the
district
court
that
he's
in
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
one
thing
the
code
clearly
does
is
distinguish,
at
least
in
6511,
between
claim
and
return,
so
presumably
it...
there
is
no
reason,
i
guess,
to
assume
that
it
was...
that
it
was
assuming
a
possible
identity.
justice
david
h.
souter
before
you
give
me
the
reasons,
would
you
respond
to
this
(b)(3)(c)
deals
specifically
with
the
case
in
which
a
return
has
been
filed.
doesn't
that
suggest
that
claim
in
(b)(3)(b)
was
referring
to
a
claim
in
which
a
return
had
not
been
filed?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
your...
do
you
have
a
textual
basis
for
that
understanding
that
he
cannot
dismiss?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
say
he
can't
dismiss?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
long
as
he
stays
in
the
tax
court,
but
if
he
gets
out
of
the
tax
court--
justice
david
h.
souter
--he
cannot
dismiss.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
an
inducement
to
the
taxpayer
to
get
moving.
i
mean,
you
can't
say
it's
irrational.
