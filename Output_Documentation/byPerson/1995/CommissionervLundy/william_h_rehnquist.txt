chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-1785,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
v.
robert
f.
lundy.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
jones?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
schwartz,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
the
code
does
define
a
return.
you're
saying
that
the
code
doesn't
define
a
return.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
you'd
read
(c),
which
comes
right
along
next
to
it
and
also
contains
the
word
claim,
in
deciding
what
claim
means
in
(b).
they're
not
totally
independent
sections.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
1962
senate
report
accompany?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
one
of
the
sections
involved
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
indicates
the
approval
by
a
senate
committee
of
something
that
has
been
done
over
a
period
of
years,
or
that
the
senate
committee
thinks
has
been
done
over
a
period
of
years.
i
mean,
are
we
supposed
to
take
that
as
a
substitute
for
reading
the
statutes
and
the
rulings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
plausible
argument.
i
don't
think
much
is
added
to
it
by
quoting
a
1962
senate
report.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
we're
arguing
about
in
this
case,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schwartz.
mr.
jones,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
