mr.
jones,
in
subsection
(b)
that
you're
referring
to
it
says
that
no
credit
or
refund
will
be
allowed
unless
it
was
paid
within
the
period
which
would
be
applicable
under
6511(b)(2)(c),
or
if
on
the
date
of
the
mailing
of
the
notice
of
deficiency
a
claim
had
been
filed,
whether
or
not
filed.
now,
that
language
is
just
incomprehensible.
what
does
that
parenthetical
mean?
does
it
mean
if
it
isn't
filed
we
can
deem
it
to
have
been
filed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
what
should
be
done
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
other
than
this,
rather
unusual
circumstances
of
this
case,
is
there
any
other
time
that
the
2-year
look
back
period
would
apply
under
this
subsection?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
apply
only
to
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
in
no
other
instance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
has
the
irs
been
totally
consistent
in
its
position
and
interpretation
of
this
statute?
it
seems
rather
inconsistent
with
the
position
the
government
took
in
the
miller
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
with
the
revenue
ruling
76-511.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
schwartz,
under
your
interpretation,
when
would
section
6512(b)(3)(b)
ever
act
as
a
bar
to
claiming
a
refund?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
don't
look
to
that
subsection
to
give
me
that
answer.
what...
when
would
that
subsection
serve
as
a
bar
under
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
under
your
interpretation,
(b)(3)(b)
just
would
never
apply
to
give
effect
to
your--
--it's
never
a
bar,
but
it's
a
tolling
provision,
isn't
that
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
everybody
agrees
with
that.
so
the
statute
of
limitations
wouldn't
have
run,
on
your
theory,
but
the
bar
to
recovery
of
money
would
have.
