justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
just
before
were
saying...
you
were
asked
the
question,
has
the
government
always
been
consistent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
you
said,
it's
been
consistent
in
the
tax
court,
and
then
you
said,
well,
in
the
court
of
claims
for
the
refunds,
it
seems
to
be
a
little
different,
and
i
was
wondering
if
you'd
said
everything
you
wanted
to
say
there,
or
if
you
wanted
to
say
a
little
more--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
still
a
little
odd,
though,
isn't
it,
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
take
it...
it's
april
15,
for
the
last
year,
right.
this
is
right.
then
you
have...
if
you
file
your
return
within
2
years,
you're
home
free.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
problem.
if
you
wait
till
after
3
years,
you've
had
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
either
court.
now
we're
talking
about
that
key
middle
year
between
2
years
and
3,
and
if
you
go
into
the
tax
court,
on
your
reading
of
it,
it's
a
race.
if
they
get
the
deficiency
notice
out
before
you
file
your
return,
you
only
get
the
2-year
look
back,
so
you've
had
it.
if
you're
in
the
court
of
claims...
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
mean
to
be
pejorative.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
wait.
if...
i
didn't
mean...
i
mucked
it
up
by
saying
this
pejoratively.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
happens.
in
the
tax
court,
during
that
key
year...
nothing's
happened,
2
years
have
gone
by.
now,
during
the
next
year,
if
the
notice
of
deficiency
comes
out,
forget
it.
if,
before
the
notice
of
deficiency
comes
out,
the
taxpayer
wakes
up
and
files
his
return,
then
you
get
back
the
3
years.
that's
correct,
isn't
it.
but
in
the
court
of
claims,
if
the
notice
of
deficiency
comes
out,
the
taxpayer
can
wake
up
then
and
file
the
return,
and
then
he'll
get
the
3-year
look
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
because
they
did
that,
they
thought
you
could
file
a
return
forever,
but
they
forget
if
you
file
a
return
50
years
later,
you're
only
going
to
get
3-year
look
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
really
see
how
you
avoid
the
language.
i
mean,
it's...
i've
been
struggling
with
it.
it
seems
just
like
somebody
says...
to
your
son
you
say,
i'll
give
you
all
the
ice
cream
you
could
have
eaten
at
the
drug
store
if
you'd
been
there.
i
mean,
if,
it
sort
of
means...
i
can't
get
it
work
any
other
way.
it's
working
like
a
that.
it's
working
like,
i'll
tell
you
how
much
i'll
give
you.
i'll
give
you
the
amount
you
could
have
eaten
if
you'd
been
there.
and
then
if
you
twist
it
around
the
way
you
want
to
twist
it,
the
thing
sort
of
hangs
in
the
air.
i
can't
figure
out
how
to
get
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
(b),
the
key
language
here,
6512(b)(3)(b).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
looks
like...
the
question,
it
seemed
to
me
is
whether
that
comma
after
(d)
means
that
you
should
read
the
if
like
a
which,
whereas
they
want
to
read
it
like
a
that,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
avoid
it,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
i
put
that
so
you
can
explain
to
me
how
you
could.
one
way
is,
you
get
the
word
claim
to
mean
refund,
you
see.
i
mean,
you
get...
not
refund,
return.
you
get
the
word
claim
to
include
a
return.
that
would
do
it,
except
you
run
into
problems
elsewhere
across
the
page,
where
they
quite
clearly
distinguish
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
can't
think
of
any
other
way
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
yes,
if
claim
includes
return,
then
you've
got
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
only
the
section
before
they
talk
about
claims
and
they
talk
about
returns,
and
there's
a
whole
phrase
there
that
doesn't
make
too
much
sense
unless
they
mean
to
leave
open
the
possibility
that
you
could
have
a
claim
that
didn't
have
a
return.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
is
there
any
other...
are
you...
is
there
any
other
reading
of
this
language
that
gets
you
where
you
want?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand...
i
like
legislative
history,
too,
but
nonetheless
you
do
have
to
deal
with
the
language
that
they
enacted,
and
that's
why
i'm
looking
to
see
is
there
any
other
reading
of
that
language,
other
than
a
claim
including
the
word
return,
that
will
get
you
where
you
want
to
go.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't.
it
says,
if.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
well,
you
can
use
it,
though,
and
that's
why
i
use
the
ice
cream
example,
i'll
give
you
all
you
could
have
eaten
if
you'd
been
there.
that's
all...
that
doesn't
mean,
if
you
had
been
there,
then
something
else
would
have
happened.
it's
a
limitation.
it
means
how
much
you're
going
to
get.
so
we
use
the
word
if
sometimes
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
still
don't
see
how
you
read
the
statute...
i
mean,
you
know,
i...
it
makes
sense
for
congress
to
say,
everybody
gets
3
years.
it
also
makes
sense
to
say,
if
you
don't
file
your
return,
you
get
2
years.
maybe
they
ought
to
say,
2
years
if
you
don't
file
your
return,
3
years
if
you
do.
maybe
it's
a
little
different,
whether
it's...
but
what
does
it
say?
i
can't
work
out...
i
mean,
i
can't
figure
out
any
way
to
get
it--
