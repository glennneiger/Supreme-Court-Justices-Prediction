justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
raises
a
question,
mr.
jones.
as
i
understand
it,
this
provision,
as
you
read
it,
favors
the
taxpayer
when
the
taxpayer
has
filed
a
return.
we
get
into
this
problem
with
the
taxpayer
who
hasn't
filed
a
return,
and
at
some
point
in
the
exchanges
between
the
irs
and
the
service,
the
taxpayer
was
told,
file
your
return
soon,
and
if
you
don't,
then
we'll
prepare
a
substitute
return
for
you.
can
you
explain
how
that
would
have
played
out
if
the
service,
instead
of
sending
the
notice
of
deficiency,
had
first
filed
a
substituted
return
for
the
taxpayer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
substituted
return
would
not
have
counted--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
serve
as
the
return.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
correctly
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
as
long
as
he
didn't
file
a
return?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
you
read
the
statute,
he
must
have
filed
a
return
first.
he
could
have
filed
a
formal,
informal,
all
the
claims
in
the
world,
and
on
your
reading
of
the
statute
it
would
not
have
made
any
difference.
what
he
had
to
file,
what
he
didn't
file
before
the
notice
of
a
deficiency
was
not
a
claim,
but
a
return.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jones,
may
i
derail
you
just
for
a
moment
to
go
back
to
where
you
were
in
the
tax
court?
one
might
wonder
whether
the
commissioner
was
always
consistent
in
the
tax
court
because
part
of
the
history
of
this
case
that
initially
this
taxpayer,
that
the
answer
in
the...
to
the
petition
in
the
tax
court
didn't
raise
a
time
bar,
and
in
fact
the
taxpayer
got
a
letter
that
said,
you're
going
to
get
a
refund
check,
and
then
it
was
over
a
year
after
the
initial
answer
that
the
amendment
was
made
to
assert
the
time
bar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
just
a
delay.
there
just
wasn't...
there
was
an
answer.
the
time
bar
was
obvious
from
the
start,
and
yet
over
a
year
went
by
without
this
being
asserted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
does
matter
is
your
approach
to
reading
this
statute,
and
i
understand
what
you
say
about
the
tax
court.
you've
got
to
apply
this
literally.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
judge
wiggins
didn't
apply
the
limitation
there
applicable
literally.
he
seemed
to
be
looking
for
some...
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
gave
for
a
construction
that
as
far
as
i
can
see
varied
from
what
you
said
in
your
revenue
ruling,
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
gave
is
there
ought
to
be
symmetry
between
the
tax
court
and
the
district
court
claims
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
revenue
ruling,
you
say
you
don't
know
whether
that's
administrative
grace,
that's
why...
but
the
revenue
ruling
for
that
particular
taxpayer,
because
of
the
3-year
look
back
period,
came
out
that
the
taxpayer
didn't
get
the
refund.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
wouldn't
that
have
been
the
same
thing
in
miller,
that...
wouldn't
the
tax--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
that...
in
that
same
vein,
then
can
you
tell
us
under
what
circumstances
the
2-year
look
back
would
apply
when
the
commissioner...
when
the
commissioner
sends
a
notice
of
deficiency?
the
commissioner
sends
a
notice
of
deficiency.
when
would
the
2-year
look
back
ever
come
into
play?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
view
of
the
2-year
look
back
is,
it
can
only
work
to
the
taxpayers
advantage--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
it
turns
out
to
be
longer
than
the
3
years
from
the
return
filing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
answer
to
the
question
about,
couldn't
you
revive
a
stale
claim
by
paying
a
little
bit
years
down
the
road,
don't
you...
aren't
you
still
bound
by
the
look
back
period
that
you
can't
go
more
than
3
years...
you
can't
get
back
money
that
you
paid
more
than
3
years
ago?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
doesn't
the
look...
the
very
purpose
of
the
look
back
provision
to
stop
that
kind
of
thing
where
you,
many
years
down
the
road,
pay
a
small
piece,
a
small
overpayment,
claim
that
back,
and
then...
and
use
that
as
leverage
to
go
7
years
back
to
get
the
rest
of
the
overpayment?
isn't
that
the
very
purpose
of
having
these
look
back
provisions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
taxpayer
would
be
in
this
bind
if
they
filed
the
tax
return
with
2
years,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
the
question.
has
congress
done
that,
or
has
congress
said,
if
you
wait
beyond
2
years,
you're
in
jeopardy
of
getting
that
notice
of
deficiency
first.
