mr.
jones,
can
i
ask
something
about
the
government's
theory
of
why,
when
the
return
is
later
filed,
after
the
deficiency
has
been
assessed,
you
do
not
thereupon
get
the
benefit
of
the
3-year
period?
i
think
i
may
disagree
with
you
as
to
the
reason,
though
perhaps
not
as
to
the
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
do
that,
you've
left
me
in
some
confusion.
i
was
astounded
to
hear
you
say
that
justice
stevens
had
put
his
finger
on
the
crux
of
the
question.
the
point
he
raised
was
not
raised
in
your
brief,
as
far
as
i
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
claimed...
well,
he
is
questioning
whether
the
claim
might
not
constitute
a
return.
your
brief
doesn't
say
that
the
claim
constituted
the
filing
of
the
return.
to
the
contrary,
it
says
the
later
filing
of
the
return
constitutes
the
claim.
that's
quite
different,
it
seems
to
me.
well,
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
do
you
think
the
claim
constitutes
the
return,
or
the
later
return
constitutes
the
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand
that.
that
has
nothing
to
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--with
what's
the
claim
and
what's
the
return.
but
i
thought
your
brief--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
far
as
the
word
claim
and
return,
i
thought
your
position
was
the
later
return
was
the
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
later
return.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
that's
not
what
justice
stevens
was
questioning
about
at
all.
either
you
misunderstood
him,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
government's
position
is
that
(b)(3)(b)
doesn't
refer
to
any
real
claim.
it's
a
hypothetical
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
square
your
notion
that
claim
means
a
valid
claim,
that
is,
a
claim
accompanying
a
return,
with
the
language
of
6511(a),
which
says
a
claim
for
credit
or
refund
of
an
overpayment
in
respect
to
which
the
taxpayer
is
required
to
file
a
return
shall
be
filed
within
3
years,
blah,
blah,
blah,
and
then
at
the
end
of
that
sentence,
or
if
no
return
was
filed
by
the
taxpayer
within
2
years
from
the
time
the
tax
was
paid.
that
clearly
contemplates
a
claim
being
made
without
a
return
having
been
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not...
i
don't
want
to
know
when
the
2-year
rule...
i
want
to
know
how
it
squares
with
your
notion
that
when
the
statute
says
claim,
it
means
a
valid
claim,
that
is,
a
claim
accompanied
by
a
tax
return.
that's
your
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
must
be
on
a
tax
return.
well,
that
doesn't
square
with
the
language
of
6511(a).
it
clearly
contemplates
a
claim
where
no
return
has
been
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
read
that
way.
claim
for
credit
of
any
tax
in
respect
of
which
tax,
the
taxpayer
is
required
to
file
a
return.
where
are
you
reading
from?
6511(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't
dismiss?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
cannot
dismiss--
--i
understand
this--
--he
cannot
dismiss
the
suit
that
he
brought?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
he's
the
one
that
takes
the
initiative
in
getting
it
before
the
tax
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that's
one
of
the
penalties
for
not
filing
a
tax
return
when
you're
supposed
to.
i
mean,
there
are
all
sorts
of
penalties.
isn't
it
conceivable
that
this
is
one
of
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
remains
to
be
seen.
i
mean--
[laughter]
but
the
mere
notion
that
this
is
unthinkable
doesn't
strike
me
as
self
evident.
i
mean,
we
begin
with
a
taxpayer
who
didn't
file
a
tax
return
when
he
should
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
would
congress
have
said
what
the
government
says
it
said
more
clearly
than
what
is
here?
you
apparently...
i
gather
from
an
earlier
comment
you
apparently
think
it
would
have
been,
the
problem
is
that
(3)(b),
what
was
it,
6512(b)(3)(b)
does
not
say,
as
if
on
the
date
of
mailing,
but
just
if
on
the
date
of
the
mailing,
but
it
couldn't
possibly
say
as
if.
within
the
period
which
would
be
applicable,
as
if
on
the
date
of
the
mailing?
no.
i
mean,
the
way
to
say
what
the
government
says
it
says
is
precisely
what
is
written
here,
within
the
period
that
would
be
applicable
under
section
6511
if
on
the
date,
not
as
if.
i
wouldn't
put
an
as
in
there.
they
would
be
totally
incoherent.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
you
say
that
it
requires
as
if,
in
order
to
get
their
interpretation,
but
it
seems
to
me
their
interpretation
is
precisely
what's
written
there...
within
the
period
which
would
be
applicable
if
the
notice
of
deficiency
had
been
filed.
i
don't
know
how
you
get
an
as
if
there.
it
doesn't
make
sense
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
question,
mr.
jones...
you
can
answer
yes
or
no...
can
a
taxpayer
dismiss
a
petition
filed
with
the
tax
court?
