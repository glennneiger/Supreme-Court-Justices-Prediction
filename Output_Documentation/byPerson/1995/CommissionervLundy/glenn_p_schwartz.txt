mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
justice
stevens
identified
the
core
issue
in
the
interpretation
of
6512(b)(3)(b).
the
key
question
is,
what
is
meant
by
the
word
claim
in
that
statute?
under
the
interpretation
of
the
irs,
the
claim
is
a
defective
claim,
because
if
congress
intended,
and
it
must
have,
that
that
claim
be
valid,
then
it
would
have
to
be
on
a
federal
income
tax
return
for
the
following
reasons.
a
return
is
required
to
be
filed
under
6011,
but
6011
does
not
define
what
a
return
is,
nor
do
the
regulations,
but
the
case
law
has--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--the
code
does
not
define
a
return,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
your
honor,
a
claim
and
a
return
can
be
different
documents.
for
example,
for
taxes
other
than
an
income
tax,
form
843
is
used,
the
claim
for
refund
form.
prior
1976,
a
form
843
claim
could
be
used
in
lieu
of
an
amended
return,
but
whereas
here
an
original
return
has
not
been
filed,
a
valid
claim
for
refund,
and
congress
must
have
meant
that
that
claim
be
valid,
must
be
on
a
federal
income
tax
return
for
these
reasons.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i...
the
proper...
the
question
is,
what
does
congress
mean
by
claim
in
(b)(3)(b)?
that's
the
question,
and
it
has
to
mean
a
valid
claim.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
claim
in
(b)
still
has
to
be
a
valid
claim,
and
i
would
like
to
explain
what
a
valid
claim
has
to
be.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
i
devoted--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--your
honor--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--your
honor,
we
have
alternative
arguments.
the--
[laughter]
our
first
argument
is
that
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
a
deemed
claim
at
all,
it
provides
a
reference
date
for
application
of
the
limitation
period.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
all
right...
okay.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
your
honor--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--we've
devoted
four
or
five
or
six
pages
of
our
brief
to
the
question
of,
if
it
is
assumed
that
there
is
a
deemed
claim,
if
that's
what
the
language
means,
and
we
don't
concede
that,
then
the
deemed
claim
must
have
been
a
valid
claim,
and
the
only
valid
claim
that
could
be
filed
under
these
circumstances--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--is
a
return.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him,
but
the
core
issue
with
respect
to
this
statute
is
what
is
meant
by
the
word
claim.
claim
has
to
mean
return.
claim,
again,
is
not
defined
in
the
statute
or
in
the
regs,
but
the
regs
under
6011
do
say
that
you
should
make
returns
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
treasury
regulations.
now,
a
claim...
a
return
has
been
defined
under
case
law
as
meaning
any
document
which
contains
sufficient
information
to
allow
the
irs
to
determine
tax
liability.
now,
the
irs
in
its
construction
of
this
section
has
ignored...
in
every
brief
it
submitted
to
the
tax
court,
the
fourth
circuit
and
this
court,
the
last
phrase
of
the
statute
treats
it
as
surplusage,
stating
the
grounds
upon
which
the
tax
court
finds
that
there's
an
overpayment.
in
fact,
the
irs
went
so
far
as
to
excise
it
from
its
quotation
of
the
statute
on
page
5
of
its
reply
brief,
but
this
language
is
important,
because
if
the
claim
referred
to
in
6512(b)(3)(b)
states
the
grounds
upon
which
the
tax
court
finds
that
there
is
an
overpayment,
that
would
constitute
the
same
information
that
would
be
on
a
return,
because
the--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--well,
it's...
even
if
it's
a
hypothetical
claim,
it
has
to
be
something,
and
it
has
to
be
a
valid
claim.
a
valid
claim
has
to
be
a
return.
the
statutory
language
requires
that
it
state
the
grounds
upon
which
the
tax
court
finds
there's
a
overpayment.
in
this
very
case,
the
irs
employed
the
taxpayer's
return
to
determine
that
there
was,
in
fact,
an
overpayment.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
your
honor,
if
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
mailed
more
than
3
years
from
the
due
date
of
the
return,
that
would
be
at
a
time
when
the
taxpayer
could
not
have--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--i
don't
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--your
honor,
our
view
of
6512(b)(3)(b)
is
that
it's
basically...
if
the
statute
of
limitations
was
open
to
the
taxpayer
on
the
date
that
the
notice
was
mailed,
then
it's
open
to
him
in
the
tax
court,
that
he...
the
tax
court
can
grant
him
a
refund,
so
if
the
notice
was
mailed
after
3
years
from
the
due
date,
then
under
no
circumstances
could
the
taxpayer
recover.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
that's
correct.
the
statute
of
limitations
on
filing,
in
theory,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
that
goes
on
forever.
treasury
reg
6402-3(a)(5)
says
that
a
return
showing
an
overpayment
constitutes
a
claim
for
refund,
and
it's
deemed
filed
on
the
same
day,
so
a
return
filed
several
years
after
the
due
date
would
be
a
timely
claim,
but
the
limitation
on
amount
would
limit
the
taxpayer
to
the
amount
paid
in
the
3
years
preceding
the
filing
of
the
return,
so
there's
no
danger
of
stale
claims,
and
there's
no
danger
of
a
stale
claim
here.
the
second
reason
that
this--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--the
2-year
look
back
would
come
into
play
the
same
way
it
would
come
into
play
if
we
were
not
dealing
with
the
tax
court,
and
that
is
where
the
2
years
from
the
date
the
tax
is
paid
provides
for
a
longer
period
of
limitation
than
3
years
from
the
date
the
return
was
filed,
and
that
could
come
up
in
connection
with
an
audit.
for
example,
if
a
taxpayer,
1990
tax
year,
his
due
date
is
april
15,
1991.
that's
the
date
that
the
taxes
are
paid,
and
pursuant
to
an
audit
2
years
later
he
makes
an
additional
payment.
he
has
2
years
to
claim
a
refund
for
the
taxes
paid
pursuant
to
the
audit,
but
only
3
years
to
claim
the
taxes
that
were
paid
on
the
due
date.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
that
is
correct.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
that
is
correct.
in
the
case
of
a
return
required
tax,
the
only
2-year
rule
that
applies
is
the
first
2-year
rule.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
your
honor,
there
are
several
reasons
why
that
second
2-year
rule
does
not
apply
to
a
taxpayer
who's
required
to
file
a
return.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
my
principle
is
that
a
valid
claim
for
refund
where
no
original
return
has
been
filed
must
be
on
a
tax
return.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
that's
for
nonreturn
required
taxes.
that
second
2-year
rule
is
for
nonreturn
required
taxes,
such
as
transferee
liability.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
your
honor,
may
i
explain?
the...
there
are
two
or
three
reasons
why
that
second
2-year
rule
where
no
return
has
been
filed
does
not
apply
to
mr.
lundy.
the
first
is,
if...
the
first
3-year
rule,
3
years
from
the
date
the
return
is
filed,
or
2
years
from
the
date
the
tax
is
paid,
whichever
is
later,
covers
all
possible
situations,
because
if
you
assume
that
an
original
claim
could
be
filed
that
was
not
a
return,
it
would
be
covered
by
that
first
2-year
rule,
making
the
second
2-year
rule
surplusage.
the
second
reason
is,
if
the...
if
it
was
possible
to
file
a
claim
for
refund
that...
where
no
original
return
has
been
filed,
it
would
be
limited
by
the
first
2-year
rule,
because
the
first
2-year
rule
would
provide
a
longer
period
of
time
than
the
3-year
rule,
so
that
the
second
2-year
rule
would
be
surplusage.
the
second
reason
is,
if,
as
the
irs
contends,
that
the
first
sentence
of
6511(a)
applies
to
return
required
taxes,
including
the
second
2-year
rule,
or
if
no
return
was
required,
and
the
second
sentence
of
6511(a)
applies
to
stamps,
then
there's
no
rule
to
recover
nonreturn
required
taxes,
so
that
second
2-year
rule,
which
is
surplusage
for
a
return
required
tax,
must
apply
to
nonreturn
required
tax.
third,
as
originally
enacted
in
1954,
the
statute
provided
for
a
limitation
period
of
3
years
from
the
due
date.
it
was
an
absolute
minimum
3-year
period,
so
that
that
second
2-year
rule,
or
if
no...
2
years
from
the
date
the
tax
was
paid
if
no
return
was
filed,
could
not
possibly
apply
to
a
return
required
tax.
in
fact,
the
tax
court
in
this
very
case
stated
that
under
the
'54
code
as
originally
enacted,
the
taxpayer
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
refund
even
under
the
deemed
claim
theory
because
it
was
filed
within
3
years
from
the
due
date.
now,
congress
in
1958
extended
that
period
of
time.
the
amendment
in
1958
was
to
improve
the
taxpayer's
position
to
provide
that
he
would
be
able...
because
the
commissioner
could
assess
a
deficiency
within
3
years
from
the
date
the
return
was
filed,
but
the
taxpayer
was
limited
to
3
years
from
the
date
the
return
was
due,
so
as
the
tax
court
acknowledged
that
he
could
have
recovered
under
the
language
as
originally
enacted,
the
tax
court
judge
acknowledged
that
the
purpose
of
the
'58
amendment
was
to
extend
the
time
for
filing,
and
yet
what
the
tax
court
said
was,
somehow
congress
did
not
perhaps
analyze
all
the
effects
of
this
language.
and
your
honor,
i
submit
that
this
legislative
history
is
convincing
evidence
that
a
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
a
minimum
of
3
years.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
you're
talking
about
the--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--oh--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--well--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--your
honor,
i
d
like
to
get
back
to
the
claim.
i
would
like
to
address--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--right.
there's
two--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--well--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--well,
the
legislative
history.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
well,
your
honor,
the
irs
has
contended
that
the
language
is
plain
throughout
the
litigation,
but
it
is
not
plain.
our
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that...
the
statute
doesn't
say,
as
if
a
claim
was...
had
been
filed,
or
assuming
that.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
if.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
and
if
is
a
conditional.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
in
this
context,
your
honor...
the
problem
has
arisen
because
congress
took
the
short
cut
of
incorporating
the
general
statute
of
limitations
under
6512,
and
the
triggering
points,
the
triggering
points
for
the
limitation
periods
in
6511
are
couched
in
terms
of
claim
for
refund,
because
an
administrative
claim
for
refund
is
a
prerequisite
to
the
granting
of
an
administrative
refund
or
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
so
it...
the
statute's
not
self
executing
when
it's
incorporated
by
reference
into
6512,
and
so
there
had
to
be
a
reference
to
the
word
claim
to
trigger
the
limitation
periods
in
6511,
because
the
taxpayer
would
not
have
filed
a
claim
for
refund
in
the
tax
court
because
that's
not
a
prerequisite,
and
this
has
always
been
interpreted
as
a
reference
date
for
application
of
the
limitation
periods
in
the
tax
court,
so
that
if
the
statute
was
open
to
the
taxpayer
on
that
date,
if
he
could
have
filed
a
timely
claim
for
refund
on
the
date
that
the
notice
was
mailed,
he's
entitled
to
a
refund
in
the
tax
court.
that's
the
understanding
of
congress.
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
we
quote
from
a
60...
1963
senate
report,
and
it
says,
since
the
1954
enactment,
moreover,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
in
practice
interpreted
the
law
as
permitting
the
refund
of
amounts
where
valid
claims
have
been
timely
filed,
as
well
as
where
those
claims
could
have
been
filed
on
the
date
of
the
mailing
of
the
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
it
accompanied
the
addition
of
a
provision
that
allowed...
the
provision
accompanied
(b)(3)(c),
which
allows
the
tax
court
to
grant
a
refund
where
the
claims
have
been
filed
prior
to
the
mailing
of
the
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
it's
not,
but
this
clearly
indicates
the
existence
of
a
longstanding
administrative
practice
and
senate
approval--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
there
is
no
deemed
claim,
that
it's
a
reference
date
so
that
the
taxpayer
is...
if
he
could
have
filed
a
valid
claim
for
refund
on
the
date
the
notice
was
mailed,
he's
entitled
to
a
refund.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
well,
your
honor,
there's
other
evidence
of
the
longstanding
administrative
practice
of
the
service
to
grant
refunds
under
these
circumstances.
for
one,
i
would...
the
explosion
of
cases
that
occurred
since
1991
and
1992,
this
court
in
fribourg
navigation
stated
that
where
you
have
an
explosion
in
litigation
where
before
there
was
none,
it
is
strong
evidence
of
the
longstanding
administrative
practice.
you
have
the
facts
of
this
very
case,
where
once
the
taxpayer
dropped
his
petition
in
the
mail
box,
under
the
irs
theory
of
this
case,
he
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
yet
the
irs
answered
the
complaint,
they
dealt
with
him
for
a
year,
they
made
him
submit
160-some
pages
of
documents--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--no,
your
honor.
once
he
petitions
the
tax
court
under
6512(a)
he's
precluded
from
thereafter
going
to
the
district
court,
so
he
was
out
of
luck,
and
once
he
filed
that
petition
in
the
tax
court,
he
had
no
way
of
ever
getting
his
refund
back.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
but
the
tax
court
acquires
deficiency
and
refund
jurisdiction
the
moment
that
the
taxpayer
files
his
petition
in
response
to
the
notice.
once
that
occurs,
he's
thereafter
barred
from
going
to
the
district
court
and
seeking
a
refund,
so
he
sort
of
got
caught
in
the
crack.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
no.
once
the
tax
court
acquires
jurisdiction,
that's
it.
he's
out
of
luck.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
he's
not
bringing
the
suit.
he's
responding
to
the
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that
once
he
files
a
petition,
that's
final.
the
tax
court
acquires
jurisdiction,
and
thereafter
the
tax
court
is
precluded...
excuse
me,
the
taxpayer
is
precluded
from
ever
going
to
another
court.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
6512(a),
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
i
don't
have
the
statute
in
front
of
me--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--but
it
precludes
him
from
thereafter
filing
a
suit
in
the
district
court.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
he
can't
get
out
of
the
tax
court,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
that's
correct.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
you
mean
assuming
that
he
somehow
would
be
able
to
file
a
refund
suit?
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
yes,
but
the
look
back
rule
is
the
teeth
of
the
limitation
provisions,
and
prevents
stale
claims.
but
your
honor,
this
case
is
very
much
like
williams,
because
the
very
purpose
of
the
tax
court
is
to
assist
taxpayers
like
mr.
lundy
to
allow
him
to
contest
an
asserted
deficiency
without
first...
without
prepaying,
and
yet,
once
he
filed
his
petition
in
the
tax
court,
he
was
in
a
position
where
he
had
no
realistic
alternative,
and
no
remedy,
because
his
only
choice
once
that
notice
of
deficiency
is
mailed
to
him
is
either
to
prepay
the
tax
and
file
a
suit
in
the
district
court,
or
go
to
the
tax
court,
where
he
forfeits
his
refund,
so
that
remedy--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--your
honor,
there
are
penalties.
there's
a
penalty
for
late
filing,
6651,
but
confiscation
of
your
refund
is
not
one
of
those
penalties.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
if
we
assume
that
mr.
lundy
had
a
neighbor
in
the
same
position
who
overpaid
his
'87
income
taxes,
the
return
was
due
on
april
15,
'88,
and
he
also
was
late
filing,
but
he
never
got
a
notice
of
deficiency,
he
filed
on
the
same
date,
on
december
28,
more
than
2
but
less
than
3
years,
he'd
get
his
refund.
mr.
lundy
didn't.
or--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--but
your
honor--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--that's
correct,
but
congress
has
afforded
taxpayers
a
3-year
grace
period,
and
this
is
taken
away
from
them
by
the
mailing
of
a
notice
of
deficiency.
why--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--but
congress
has
not
said
that.
that's
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
statute.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--our
interpretation
is
that
the
taxpayer
is
in
the
same
position
in
the
tax
court
as
he
would
be
in
the
district
court,
the
claims
court,
or
filing
an
administrative
claim
for
refund.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
but
that's
what
the
government
does
in
all
of
its
briefs.
they
say,
as
if--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--assuming
that.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
the
language
is
not
clear,
your
honor.
my
time
is
limited.
i--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--my
time
is
limited.
i'd
like
to
take
the
opportunity
to
persuade
you
that
the
claim
should
be
considered
a
return.
there
are
two
other
reasons
that
claim
in
this
context
must
be
considered
to
be
return.
treasury
reg
6502-2(b)
requires
that
a
claim
contain
the
detailed
statement
of
the
grounds
upon
which
the
claim
is
based.
that,
again,
is
the
same
information
that
if
on
a
document
submitted
to
the
irs
under
case
law
and
under
a
'74
revenue
ruling
would
constitute
a
return
and
finally,
and
most
important,
regulation
6402-3(a)(1)
requires,
whereas
here
no
original
return
has
been
filed,
that
the
taxpayer
must
file
his
claim
on
a
return.
so
the
irs
is
asking
you
to
ignore
its
own
regulations
and
treat
the
claim
referred
to
in
6512(b)(3)(b)
as
a
defective
claim,
and
i
think
that's
an
impermissible
construction.
i
think
you
have
to
attribute
to
congress
an
intent
that
that
claim
is
a
valid
claim.
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
well,
your
honor--
mr.
glenn
p.
schwartz
--well,
i
think
the
key
thing
here
is
that
a
claim
filed
on
a
return,
that
a
return
showing
an
overpayment,
is
the
equivalent
of
a
claim
under
the
treasury
regs...
own
regulations.
thank
you.
