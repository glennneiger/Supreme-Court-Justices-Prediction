mr.
jones,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
(b),
the
same...
the
one
that
is
at
issue
here?
it
says,
if
a
refund
claim
had
been
filed.
now,
if
on
that
date...
i
guess
it
was
september
26,
1990...
before
receiving
a
notice
of
deficiency
the
taxpayer
had
decided
that
he
ought
to
file
a
refund
claim
because
he
realized
that
they
had
overwithheld,
what
document
would
he
have
then
filed?
would
it
not
have
been
a
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
else?
is
there
any--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--other
form
that
the
irs
uses
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
claim
a
refund
without
filing
a
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
any
internal
revenue
form
that
provides
for
seeking
a
refund
without
filing
a
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
an
internal
revenue
form
that
seeks
a
refund
without
filing
a
return?
i
don't
think
there
is,
but
if
there
is,
would
you
identify
it
for
me?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
amended
return
form,
which
is
a
kind
of
return.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
way,
is
there,
to
file
a
claim
for
refund
at
that
date
without
also
filing
a
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
form.
there's
no
regular
irs
form
that
the
average
taxpayer
who
has
overwithheld
can
go
to
the
office
and
say,
would
you
give
me
the
refund
form.
what
would
he
get?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
the
average
taxpayer
to
know
that?
if
he
went
to
the
irs,
what
would
they
tell
him
to
do?
if
he
went
to
a
lawyer,
what
would
he
tell
him
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
code
define
the
term,
claim,
as
used
in
this
section?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i...
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
why
should
we
look
at
the
definition
of
return?
we're
asking...
the
question
is,
what
does
the
word
claim
mean
in
this
section--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
you've
just
told
me
the
only
way
you
can
file
a
claim
is
by
filing
a
return--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
yet
the
claim
doesn't
include
the
term,
return.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
file
a
claim
informally
without
first
having
filed
a
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
case
gives
us
an
example
of
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
can
i
just
follow
up,
because
i
didn't
think
i
got
a
complete
answer
to
my
question.
i
asked
if
there
were
cases
involving
claims
for
refunds
such
as
the
notations...
and
you
referred
on
pages
14
and
15
of
your
reply
brief...
in
which
those
informal
claims
had
been
made
without
there
having
previously
been
filed
any
return
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
which
of
those
do
you
think
fits
that
category?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
any
of
them
involve
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
know
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
that
no
return
had
previously
been
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
could
be
cases
in
which
the
claim
for
refund
could
ever
be
filed
without
simultaneously
filing
a
return.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
they
normally
would
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
normally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
that
you
can't
give
me
an
example
in
adjudicated
cases
of
one
having
been
filed
without
the
other.
that
is,
of
the
claim
for
refund
having
been
filed
without
the
return,
which
seems
to
me
makes
it
very
reasonable
to
assume
that
when
congress
used
the
term,
claim,
they
used
it
to
apply
to
the
document
on
which
the
claim
is
normally
made.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
don't
suggest
that
at
all.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
you
cannot
file
a
claim
for
refund
without
also
having
either
previously
or
simultaneously
filed
a
return.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
haven't
given
me
a
contrary
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
jones,
you
do
have...
even
in
tax
court
cases,
you
would
have
administrative
discretion,
the
week
before
sending
a
notice
of
deficiency,
to
send
a
letter
to
the
taxpayer
saying
we're
about
to
file
a
notice
of
deficiency.
you'll
get
3
years
if
you
promptly
file
a
return.
that
you
could
do,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he'd
been
smart
enough,
he
then
could
have
filed
a
return
right
away
and
been
protected.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure,
i
am
correct,
he
could
have
protected
himself
then
by
immediately
filing
a
return,
couldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
have
had
administrative
discretion
to
tell
him
that
that
option
was
open
to
him,
would
you
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
i
guess
you
take
the
position
that
in
6511(a)
the
term
claim
can
include
valid
claims
and
invalid
claims
that
have
to
be
corrected
to
become
valid,
and
the
2-year
rule
would
apply
to
the
invalid
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
if...
you
know,
one
filed
without
a
return.
