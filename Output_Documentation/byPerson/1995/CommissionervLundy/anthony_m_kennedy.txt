does
the
taxpayer
get
a
copy
of
the
substituted
return?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
don't
attach
the
substituted
return
to
the
notice
of
deficiency.
they
have
the
same
calculation,
but
not
the
form.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
he...
in
justice
souter's
hypothetical
could
he
dismiss
the
district
court
action
and
start
all
over
again?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
think
he
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
assuming
that
he
made
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
and
filed
a
return
10
years
down
the
line,
i
assume
that...
and
that
return
had
been
filed
promptly,
i
assume
that
within
the
period
of
that
look
back
he
could
have
gotten
the
earlier
refund
that
he
was
seeking,
couldn't
he,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
i'm
assuming
that
he
promptly
dismisses
and
then
later
on
makes
money,
pays
the
money,
and
then
asks
for
some
of
it
back.
