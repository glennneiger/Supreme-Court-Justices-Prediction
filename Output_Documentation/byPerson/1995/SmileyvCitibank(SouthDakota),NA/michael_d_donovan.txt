mr.
michael
d.
donovan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
85
of
the
national
bank
act,
which
was
passed
by
congress
originally
in
1864.
in
particular,
this
case
brings
before
the
court
the
question
of
whether
congress
intended
"interest"
and
"rate"
in
that
section...
in
that
phrase
to
include
some
certain
late
fees
that
are
not
measured
by
time
or
based
upon
an
unpaid
balance
or
unpaid
late
payment,
so
as
to
preempt
state
contract
laws,
state
laws
governing
liquidated
damages
that
regulate
such
late
fees
in
a
borrower's
home
state.
the
briefs
of
the
parties
here,
your
honors,
have
presented
three
contrasting
views
as
to
what
congress
meant
when
it
used
the
phrase
85.
in
petitioner's
view,
congress
meant
a
charge
measured
by
time,
based
upon
an
unpaid
balance.
in
respondent's
view,
congress
meant
all
lending
charges;
that
is,
all
charges
that
have
an
impact
upon
the
borrower/lender
relationship
so
as
to
affect
the
yield
that
the
lender
receives
from
a
loan.
there's
a
third
contrasting
view
here,
and
that's
presented
by
the
government
that
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
the
bank
in
this
case.
that
view,
espoused
by
the
occ
recently,
is
that
"interest
at
the
rate"
does
not
mean
all
lending
charges,
even
though
it
might
have
meant
that
at
one
point,
but
it
means
something
now
or
something
less
than
all
lending
charges,
but
the
agency
will
tell
us
precisely
what
interest
charges
are
interest
at
the
rate
and
what
interest
charges
are
not
interest
at--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
the
question
of
deference
to
the
comptroller
ought
to
be
looked
at
initially
by
looking
at
the
statute
itself,
to
determine
whether
the
statute
itself
addresses
that,
so
as
to
whether
there
should
be
any
need
to
turn
to
the
comptroller.
and
here,
we
believe
that
there
are
at
least
four
phrases
in
the
statute
or
in
the
national
bank
act
itself
which
give
guidance
to
this
court
as
to
why
neither
deference
is
appropriate
and
why
"interest
at
the
rate"
mean...
means
what
petitioner
says
it
means.
first,
your
honors,
is
the
phrase
"interest
at
the
rate"
itself.
interest,
both
in
1864
and
commonly
today,
was
conceived
of
a
charge
that
was
somehow
connected
to
the
time
during
which
money
is
received
by
a
borrower
and
the
time
in
which
it's
paid
back.
it
is
also
a
charge
that
has
some
relationship
to
the
amount
of
money
received
by
the
borrower
and...
and
the
time
in
which
the
borrower
would
then
have
to
return
that
amount.
another
phrase
that
is
in
the
statute
itself,
section
85
of
the
national
bank
act,
is
found
further
down
in
the
section,
and
it
refers
to
a
common
type
of
lending
practice
that
was
prevalent
in
the
mid-1800's,
and
that
was
the
advance
collection
of
interest
on
discounted
notes,
where
a
borrower
would
tend...
tender
his
notes
in
exchange
for
a
currency,
and
the
bank
would
discount
that
note
at
the
outset
to
collect
interest.
upon
that--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--no.
in
fact,
it
still
happens
today,
justice
scalia.
but
what
congress
allowed
in
section
85
was
that
you
may
collect
interest
in
advance...
and
i'll...
and
using
the
words
of
this
statute,
"reckoning
the
days
for
which
the
note,
bill
or
other
evidence
of
debt
has
to
run.
"
now,
reckoning
isn't
a
common
word
today,
but
it
was
referring
to
some
xx
of
calculation
of
time
and
amount,
reckoning
the
two.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
well,
taking
your
question,
justice
scalia,
as,
why...
why
would
congress
do
something
like
this?
the...
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
congress...
that's
all
they
were
asked
to
do.
that's
all
they
were
focusing
on
doing
in...
in
terms
of
allowing
banks
to
charge
a
rate
of
interest
that
was
tied
to
the
bank's
home
state.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
well,
congress--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--that...
your
honor,
that
would
be,
under
our
view
of
"interest",
an
interest
charge.
that
would
be
a
charge
that
would
be
based
upon
the
outstanding
balance.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
it
would
be
a
time-based
charge.
it
would
not
be
based
upon
the
outstanding
balance.
the
congress--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--you
would
have
to
do
both,
yes.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
no.
that...
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
how...
however,
a
state
could
not
authorize
that
type
of
charge
if
it
just
was
across
the
board,
if
the
$10
did
not
vary
based
upon
the
outstanding
balance
at
all.
and
the
reason
why
was
because
congress
was
focusing
on
rate
ceilings,
so
that
those
rate
ceilings
could
be
gauged,
both
by
the
borrower
and
the
bank
at
the
outset,
to
determine
whether
there
was
compliance
with
the
usury
ceiling.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
the...
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the...
your
honor's
question.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
if
the
1
percent,
your
honor,
were
calculated
on
the
amount
of
the
late
payment,
not
on
the
entire
outstanding
balance
of
the
revolving
account.
then
the
1
percent,
if
it
varied
based
upon
time...
in
other
words,
it
could
have--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--the
15
would
be
the
ceiling?
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
the
floor.
the
15
there
would
not
be
an
interest
rate.
it
would
not
be
something
that
would
be
exportable
by
the
bank
in
one
state
to
override
the
laws
of
the
borrower
state.
if
the
1
percent,
your
honor,
were
something
that
was
charged
not
on
the
late
payment...
not
on
the
outstanding
balance,
the
aggregate
balance,
but
on
the
late
payment
balance
itself,
which
are
not
the
facts
here...
here
we
have
a
charge
that's
imposed
by
citibank,
calculable
on
the
entire
outstanding
balance,
so
that
it's
a
flat
charge,
the.65
percent
i'm
referring
to...
but
if
the
1
percent
were
calculated
on
the
late
payment
amount,
and
that
1
percent
accrued
or
ran,
in
the
words
of
this...
of
this
court,
then
that
would
be
an
interest
charge.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
in
terms
of
the
cash
advance
fee
or
the
minimum
finance
charge
that
is
involved
here?
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
that...
that
is
citibank's
practice.
we
did
not...
we
do
not
allege
that
in
the
complaint
here.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
the...
the
50-cent
charge
that
is
the
minimum
finance
charge
for
when
a
borrower
chooses
to
revolve
is...
would
be
a
charge
that
would
not
fit
our
definition
of
interest
rate.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
it--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--yes.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
the
difference,
justice
souter,
would
be
that
the
$15
charge,
if
it
is
imposed
looking
backward,
based
upon
a
default,
as
opposed
to
looking
forward,
which
is...
which
is
what
the
50-cent
charge
is...
the
50-cent
charge
is
a
charge
that
when
you
do
not
clean
up
your
revolver
at
the
end
of
the
month,
the
minimum
that
you're
going
to
have
is...
is
50
cents.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
and
that's
a
going-forward
charge,
because
it's
anticipated
that
for
each
day
that
you
revolve
that
balance,
that
you
will
then
be
accruing
a
finance
charge
at
the
19.8
percent
interest
rate.
it,
too,
would
not
have
the
characteristics
that
we
have
identified.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
at
the
time,
we
focused
on
the
late
fee
here,
justice
scalia.
so,
to
be
honest,
we
just
did
not
include
that
in
the
complaint.
i...
i
don't
have
the
california
law
here,
so--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--no,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
that
1
percent
charge
would
not
vary
based
on
time.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
if
the
arrearage
were
only
2
days--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--yes,
that...
that
is...
that
is
our
position.
looking
back--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--no,
justice
kennedy.
our
point
is
that
the
definition
you
identify,
a
charge
for
the
use
of
forbearance
or
detention
of
money,
whereas
damages
of
its
detention
describes
when
interest
may
be
charged.
it
doesn't
describe
what
interest
is.
it
doesn't
describe
what
the
components
of
interest
are.
the
case
here
questions
what
the
components
of
interest
are.
we
don't
deny
that
this
would
be
a
detention
situation,
so
that
an
interest
charge
could
be
imposed.
what
we
state
here
is
that
the
charge...
the
form
of
the
charge
here
does
not
have
the
components
of
an
interest
charge.
in
fact,
the
components
here
are
the
components
of
a
liquidated
damage
of
penalty
charge.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
the
distinction,
your
honor,
is
that
here
the
flat
charge
is
imposed
in
addition
to
a
daily
accruing
finance
charge,
an
interest
charge
that's
measured
by
time
and
amount,
which
is
accruing
on
the
entire
detained
balance.
here,
if
you
detain
the
late
payment,
you
still
have
the
accrual
of
the
interest
finance
charge
going
on,
and
you
have
a
special
damage
amount
imposed
on
top
of
that.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
if--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
in
lieu
of.
i
am
suggesting
that
it's
a
different
type
of
charge
that
is
not
a
greater...
greater
interest
charge.
here,
citibank
could
impose
a
greater
interest
charge,
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
if
citibank
said,
if
you
were
late
on
a
payment,
you
must
pay
an
additional
3
percent,
so
that
your
interest
rate
will
raise
from
19.9
percent
to
15.9
percent.
what
citibank
may
not
do...
because
that
charge
would
then
vary,
depending
upon
how
much
the
credit
card
holder
had
and
how
much
time
was
involved.
what
citibank
may
not
do,
though,
is
impose
a
sum-certain
charge
that
doesn't
vary
whether
the
payment
is
$20
or
$2,000,
and
it
doesn't
vary
whether
the
payment
is
1
day
late
or
2
day...
2
days
late.
the
reason
being,
your
honors,
is
the
difference
between...
if
i...
if
i
may
focus
on
the
words
"rate"
and
"amount"
in
the
statute
that
congress
enacted.
here,
congress
envisioned
a
difference
between
the
words
85.
when
congress
was
referring
to
rate,
it
was
referring
to
a
charge
that
was
reckonable,
to
use
the
words
of
the
statute,
over
the
number
of
days
that
the
note,
bill
or
other
evidence
of
debt
were...
were
outstanding.
that
word
85,
or
the
first
part
of
section
30,
which
enacted
both
section
85
and
86.
the
word
86,
and
it
refers
to
a
flat
penalty-type
of
provision,
an
aggregate
sum,
that's
a...
a
calculable
sum.
and
it
refers
to
what
the
bank
owes
the
borrower
when
the
bank
overcharges
or
commits
usury.
so
an
amount
is
a
flat
amount
that
the
bank
has
to
write
a
check
and
pay
back
to
the
borrower
when
the
bank
violates
the
usury
ceiling.
the
rate
is
a
ratio...
just
basic
english...
is
a
ratio
charge.
so,
the
difference
that
i
am
trying
to
explain
i...
hopefully...
is
that
the
rate
here...
or
the
charge
here...
is
not
a
rate
charge.
it's
a
flat
amount
that's
imposed
on
a
default.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
no.
the...
the--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--yes.
the...
the
$50
a
month,
again,
would
be
a
increment,
but
would
not
be
an
interest
charge.
it
would
be
a
penalty
charge
or
a
noninterest
charge.
the
2
percent,
if
it
was
varying
based
upon
the
amount
that
you
owed
and
the
time
that
you
owed
it...
in
other
words,
you...
you're
saying
2
percent
a
month,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
sure,
by
that
hypothetical,
whether
you...
whether
you're...
you
mean--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--and...
and
if
the
arrears
are
paid
back
on
the
2nd
day
of
the
month,
do
i
have
to
pay
the
entire
2
percent
for
the...
for
the
30
days?
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
understood.
in
both
cases,
the
flat
sums
in
those
hypotheticals
would
be
noninterest
charges.
whether
the
percentage
charges
in
both
cases
are
interest
charges
depends
upon
whether
that
percentage
is
being
calculated
or
reckonable
over
the
days.
so
it
can't
just
be
a
1
percent
for
30
days.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
one
hundred
dollars
per
loan
you
would
have.
you
wouldn't
have
100--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--justice
scalia,
to
be
sure,
after
the
fact
here
a
rate
can
be
calculated
once
you
know...
once
a
late
fee
is
imposed--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--and
you
know
what
the
balance
is--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--that
it's
being
imposed
against--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--here
the
fact
is
that
you
cannot
calculate
that
rate
until
after
the
fact,
after
the
imposition
of
the
charge.
in
the
other
instances
that
you
describe--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--because...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
because
if
you
cannot
calculate
that
rate
after...
until
after
the
charge
has
been
imposed,
one,
it's
a
rate
looking
backwards
and
not
forwards;
and,
two,
it's
not
a
rate
that
somebody
can
anticipate,
either
borrower
or
a
bank,
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
charge
is
complying
with
section
86's
usury
ceiling.
and
it's
unlikely
or
implausible
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
subject
banks
to
the
severe
forfeiture
penalties
of
section
86
if
the
bank
couldn't
know
whether
it
was
complying
with
86
until
after
it
violated
that
section.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
well,
in
this--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--yes.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
yes--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--well,
justice
scalia,
here
the...
the
rate
that...
that
you're
deriving
is
a
rate
that
is
only
applied
after
the
number
of
days
have
already
been
identified,
after
the
imposition
of
the
charge
has
been
imposed.
so
that
it
is
not
a
rate
that's
accruing
as
the
days
they
go
on.
it's
not
a
reckonable
charge.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
that
maximum
rate
allowed
by
state
law,
your
honor,
would
make
it
very
difficult
for
a
bank
to
know
what
that
maximum
rate
is,
because
it
would
obviously
vary,
in
this
instance,
by
each
consumer
with
whom
the
bank
dealt.
so
that...
because
obviously
that
rate
is
going
to
change
depending
upon
the
number
of
days
that
the
consumer
pays
that
late
payment.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
first,
your
honor,
there
is
such
a
clause
that
says...
that's
similar
to
that
in
the
citibank
agreements.
citibank
makes
its
agreements
subject
to
south
dakota
and
federal
law.
second,
in
many
states,
including
my
client's
state,
the
state
provides
that
notwithstanding
choice-of-law
agreements
by
companies
in
consumer
contracts,
this
state
will
apply
its
choice-of-law
provisions
where
those
are
form
contracts
and
the
customer,
in
this
case,
accepted
the
solicitation
in
the
state
and
signed
the
solicitation
in
the
state.
so
those
are
common
types
of
choice-of-law
provisions
under
consumer
laws
in
various
states.
what
we
would
then
have
would
be
a
conflict
between
the
choice-of-law
language
selected
by
citibank
and
the
state
public
policy,
and
we
would
basically
have
a
conflicts
of
law
question,
which
is
not
the
question
that's
at
issue
here,
your
honors.
the...
the
question
at
issue
here
is
that
citibank
can
override
those
choice-of-law
provisions
by
a
broad
construction
of
the
word
85.
the
other
evidence
of
the
congress's
intent
when
it
passed
this
statute
was
what
congress
was
looking
at.
at
the
time,
congress
was
looking
at
other
state
interest
ceilings
that
were
in
existence.
and
all
of
the
legislative
debates
that
refer
to
this
section
demonstrate
that
the
members
of
congress
were
focusing
on
a
time-based,
amount-based
charge.
they
refer
to
the
percentage
ceiling
in
my
state
as
10
percent
per
annum,
the
common
law
that
has
been
issued
by
this
court,
beginning
in
the
mid-1800's
and
proceeding
since
then,
has
all
recognized
a
difference
between
flat
penalty
charges
that
are
imposed
on
top
of
prejudgment
interest
for
processing
costs
or
for
collection
costs.
in
fact,
in
the
case
decided
by
this
court,
new
orleans
v.
piaggio,
this
court
recognized
that
there
was
a
difference
between
special
damages
on
top
of
prejudgment
interest
and
prejudgment
interest.
in
united
states
v.
texas,
this
court
recognized
that
as
well.
if
i
may,
your
honors,
to
get
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
deference
to
the
occ.
in
addition
to
the
statutory
language
that
we
have
here,
there
are
two
important
reasons
why
the
occ's
position
is
not
entitled
to
deference.
first,
the
occ's
recent
interpretation
of
"interest
at
the
rate"
does
not
purport
or
even
attempt
to
rely
on
any
of
the
agencies'
expertise
in
banking
or
finance.
there
is
no
textual
analysis
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
functional
characteristic
analysis
by
the
occ,
because
the
occ
has
not
examined
what
the
differences
are
between
an
annual
fee,
for
example,
and
an
appraisal
fee
or
a
document
preparation
fee.
there
is
not
even
an
economic
study
or
even
a
banking
basis
for
the
occ's
interpretation
here.
in
fact,
what
the
occ
admits
is
that
it
is
interpreting
the
statute--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--you
have,
your
honor,
in
your
post-chevron
line
of
authorities.
in
fact,
one...
one
case
involving
the
federal
reserve
board
against
dimension
financial
and
in
other
cases
cited
in
this
court's
decision.
in
adam's
fruit,
you
have
required
at
least
some
sort
of
explanation
by
the
agency
as
to
its
interpretation.
in
other
words,
when
the
court
has
required
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute,
it's
required
reasons.
here,
the
occ--
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
--i
would
submit...
i
would
submit,
your
honors,
that...
that
this
court
would
hold
that
that
is
not
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute;
that
that
is
an
irrational,
biased
construction.
if
that
is
the
reason
here,
i
would
submit
that
that
type
of
interpretation
would
have
to
be
found
to
be
an
irrational,
biased
construction
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
well,
in...
in
the
economic
sense,
it's
rational
for
the
banks,
because
it
makes
them
better
off.
the
question,
though,
is
whether
it's
a
rational
reading
or
a
rational
interpretation
of
the
statutory
text.
here,
it
would
not
be
a
rational
interpretation,
because
then
the
statutory
text
would
mean
whatever
the
banks
want,
they
can
do.
and
that's
not
what
congress
asked.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
no.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
no,
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
what
i
mean
here
is
that
what
the
agency
has
not
done
is
it
has
not
gone
and
looked
at
what
is
the
economic
basis
or
the
functional
characteristics
of
these
charges.
for
example,
when
this
court
examined
whether...
whether
deposits
and
commercial
loans
were
similar,
or
annuities
even,
it
has
focused
on
the
fact
that
the
occ
has
determined
or
the
regulator
has
determined
that
these
are
functionally
similar
to
different
types
of
financial
products.
the
occ
has
not
done
that
with...
well,
late
fees
are
functionally
similar
to
interest
and
appraisal
fees
aren't;
attorney's
fees
are
functionally
similar,
but...
but...
but
these
other
document
preparation
fees
aren't.
that's
not
what
it's
done
here.
it
has
instead
said,
we
make
this
interpretation
because
that's
what
the
current
case
law
says.
well,
what
the
occ
is
asking
for,
then,
is
deference
not
to
an
expert
view,
but
to
lower
court
opinions.
and
this
court
doesn't
need
an
agency
to
tell
it
whether
to
defer
to
lower
court
decisions
or
not.
in
addition,
here
the
agency
has
not
explained
the
fundamental
or
important
distinctions
between
those
fees
that
it
has
now
determined
are
noninterest
and
those
fees
which
it
considers
to
be
interest.
it
doesn't
tell
us
what's
the
difference
between...
what
about
an
appraisal
fee
makes
it
noninterest
and
what
about
a
prepayment
charge
or
an
attorney's
fees
or
a
late
fee
would
make
those
interest.
it
has
absolutely
no
explanation
whatsoever
that
this
court
can
look
to
and
say,
oh,
that's
a
reasonable...
that's
a
reasonable
explanation,
or,
we
can...
we
can
respect
that
determination.
that's
not
what
it
does
at
all.
the
omissions
from
the
list
are...
equally
demonstrate
the
irrationality
of
the
occ's
position.
i
see
that
my
time
has
almost
expired.
i
will
reserve
the
remainder.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'll
be
brief.
three
points.
one,
the
definition
adopted
and
proposed
by
the
occ
here
has
no
real
logical
stopping
point,
which
is
the
primary
problem
with
the
definition
of
use,
forbearance
or
detention.
virtually
any
charge
can
be
characterized
as
a
charge
for
a
detention
of
money:
an
attorney's
fee,
a
court
cost,
any
collection
fee.
however,
congress
did
not
intend
to
embrace
all
of
those
charges
into
85.
in
fact,
congress
had
another
provision,
section
24,
which
authorized
banks
to
make
contracts
and
to...
subjected
those
banks
to
state
contract
laws.
the
comptroller
admits
that
that
section
prevents
discrimination
by
home
states
against
banks
with
regard
to
contract
charges
such
as
these.
that
section
takes
care
of
respondent's
credit
union
hypothesis,
that
there
could
be
discrimination
unless
section
85
means
everything.
that
can't
happen,
and
it's
not
the
case
here.
they
haven't
challenged
the
credit
union
measure.
mr.
michael
d.
donovan
thank
you.
