mr.
richard
b.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
concedes
that
if
this
higher
charge
were
stated
as
a
percentage,
no
matter
how
high,
then
it
would
be
interest.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
but
if
it's
stated
as
a
percentage
as
a
function
of
time,
he
would
say--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--so...
so,
to
begin
with,
he
would
say
that
if
citibank
were
to
charge
100
percent
interest--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--per
unit
of
time.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
and
i'd
like
to
address
in
a
moment,
justice
scalia,
the
question
of
the
unit
of
time.
but
per
unit
of
time,
then
that
would
be
interest.
now,
that
would
mean
that
citibank
could
charge
50...
50
percent
each
month,
100
percent
each
month,
or,
to
take
justice
ginsburg's
example,
why
couldn't
citibank
charge
50
percent
each
month
but,
up
to
a
cap,
and
then
just
say,
we
won't
charge
any
more?
why
should
it
matter
that
the
late
charge
happens
to
be
stated
in
another
way?
it
is
still
a
price
that
the
lender
is
charging
the
borrower
for
using
and
detaining
its
money.
so
the
function
of
this
charge
has
not
changed
because
of
the
way
it
was
expressed.
the
form
of
the
charge
does
not
alter
its
function.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
the
case
law
of
the
time
and
the
statutes
of
the
time
when
congress
enacted
the
national
bank
act
deal
directly
with
this
issue,
your
honor.
many
of
the
state
statutes...
in
fact,
by
my
count,
all
of
the
state
statutes
use
a
phrase
to
set
the
ceiling
of...
of
interest,
whether
it's
prematurity
interest
or
postmaturity
interest,
they
use
a
phrase
"the
rate
of
interest".
and
the
statutes
say
a
lender
can
charge
interest
up
the
rate
of
x.
and
generally
that
rate
is
stated
as
a
percentage.
and
it
has
always
been
the
case
that
that
phrase
"rate
of
interest",
in
a
statute
regulating
the
amount
of
interest
that
could
be
charged,
captured
all
forms
of
charges,
and
it
has
to.
because
if
it
didn't,
a
lender...
let's
say
that
the
rate
is
15
percent,
a
lender
could
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
charge
you
14-and-a-half
percent,
plus
a
$1,000.
and
the
$1,000
isn't
interest,
so
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
rate
ceiling.
the
phrase
"rate
of
interest"
not
only
has
a
dictionary
definition
that
includes
all
forms
of
charges,
but
it
was
always
used
by
statutes
and
by
courts
interpreting
those
statutes
to
capture
all
forms
of
lending
charges
that
had
to
do
with
the
use
or
detention
of
money.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
that's
correct.
and
to
respond
to
justice
stevens'
point
about
the
unit
of
time,
in
the
citizens
banks
against
donnell
case
that
was
decided
by
a
unanimous
court,
authored
by
justice
holmes,
one
of
the
questions
that
arose
was
whether
the
method
of
calculation
as
to
unit
of
time
in
compounding
was
something
that
the
statute,
that
section
85,
gave
to
the
law
of
the
state.
in
other
words,
did
the...
did
the
language
allowed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
in
section
85
adopt
the
manner
in
which
the
rate
of
interest
was
to
be
calculated?
because
in
that
particular
case,
there
was
a
dispute
about
how
many
times
per
year
it
was
compounded.
and,
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
the
opinion
by
justice
holmes
is
very
clear
on
this
point,
that
the
question
of
the
unit
of
time
is
up
to
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
bank
is
located.
like
the
amount
of
the
charge,
like
the
ceiling
rate,
if
you
will,
the
manner
of
computation...
the
unit
of
time...
is
committed
to
the
legislature
of
the
state
where
the
bank
is
located.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
i...
i
do.
and
i
respectfully
disagree,
and
here's
why.
the
state
statutes
of
the
day
had
a
very
similar
phrase
and
very
similar
language.
they,
too,
had
rate
caps
expressed
in
the
forms
of
percentages.
and
lenders
have
always
had
to
determine
(a)
how
much
interest
have
we
charged
this
particular
borrower?
(b)
what's
the
amount
of
the
loan?
(c)
how
long
has
this
loan
been
outstanding?
and
then
(d)
perform
a
simple
mathematical
calculation,
have
we
exceeded
the
cap?
and
so,
to
apply
the
alternative
federal
rate,
which
of
course
was
added
in
1933,
but,
nevertheless,
is
an
existing
alternative
standard--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--citibank
would
have
to
act
in
just
the
following
way,
your
honor.
first,
it
happens
to
be
in
a
state,
south
dakota,
that
does
not
have
a
rate
ceiling.
so
this
is
not
a
problem
for
citibank
under...
the
first
part
of
the--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--when--
[laughter]
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
it
happens
to
find
itself.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
we...
in...
in
complying
with
a
percentage
rate
ceiling,
whether
it
would
be
a
federal
one
or
if
were
in
a
state
that
had
a
percentage
rate
ceiling,
would
simply
have
to
analyze
what
is
the
total
interest
charged
and
compute
it
against
the
rate
cap
to
see
whether
it
had
been
exceeded.
and--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--that's
right.
and
banks
have
always
been
required
to
do
just
that.
and
we
have
cited
the
cases
on
page
24,
a
half
dozen
or
so
cases
that
show
that
that
in
fact
has
always
been
the
law.
but,
further,
i
would
point
out
that
the
statutory
language
"rate"
and
"amount"
does
not
have
any
percentage
limitation,
in
any
event.
first,
within
the
statute,
i
would
point
out
that
the
third
sentence--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--you
wouldn't
be
able
to--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--if
you
were
in
a
state
that
provided
for
a
charge
that
would,
if
computed
against
a
federal
rate
cap,
would
cause
you
to
exceed
the
cap,
you
simply
couldn't
charge
the
charge.
if...
if
you
say
to
me,
i
will
loan
you
$100
and
at
10
percent
interest,
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
also
charge
me
$50
extra
without
being
subject
to
the
rate
cap.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
well--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--well,
let's
not
mix
up
now
what
a
state
is
allowing,
because
that's
a
question
you
answer
under
the
first
clause
of
section
85,
with
what
the
federal
government
alternative
rate
would
permit.
we
have...
it's
important
to
keep
those
analytically
distinct.
so
if
a...
let's...
let's
take
the
section
of
section
85
that
we
are
focusing
on
here
in
this
case.
south
dakota
allows
any
rate
of
interest,
as
did
arizona
in
the
daggs
case
that
this
court
considered
in
1900.
and
what
that
means
is
that
a
national
bank
located
in
the
state
of
south
dakota
is
entitled
to
charge
whatever
rate
of
interest
is
agreed
upon
between
itself
and
a
borrower,
just
like
all
the
other
lenders
in
south
dakota,
because
that's
the
most-favored-lender
principle.
now,
if
the
bank,
instead
of
using
the
south
dakota
law
as
its
basis
for
the
charge,
were
to
use
the
provision
of
the
statute
that
comes
later
that,
justice
scalia,
you
are
referring
to,
it
would
have
to
have
a
ceiling
of
a
7
percent
or
whatever
that...
that
cap
would
come
out
to...
just
as
if
it
had
been
under
a
state
statute
in
1862,
before
the
national
bank
was
enacted.
it
would
have
been
under
a
state
cap
of,
say,
7
percent.
and
what
would
have
happened
was...
would
have
been
that...
that
a
court
reviewing
whether
a
charge
was
usurious
would
have
asked
the
following
question:
how
much
interest
has
been
charged?
let's
now
compute
it
as
a
percentage
and
annualize
it
over
a
year.
and
would
that
exceed
7
percent?
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
in
your
example,
yes,
your
honor,
because
it
is
the
price
that
the
bank
is
charging
for
making
available
the
credit
and
the
use
and...
and
money
on
the
terms
provided.
there
are
many,
many
different
terms
and
different
relationships,
and
expedited
money
may
cost
more.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
your
honor,
we
would
argue
that
that
is
not
for
the
extension
of
credit.
that
is
a
discrete
service.
that
is...
now
you're
not
being
charged
for
the
borrowing
of
the
money...
in...
in
the
hypothetical
as
you
stated
it...
you're
being
charged
for
a
separate
service.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
well,
to
take
the
credit
card
example
as
one,
after
you
get
a
credit
card,
you'll
often
find...
or
after
you
get
a
mortgage,
you'll
often
find
you'll
receive
in
the
mail
solicitations
from
people
who
will
say,
we'd
like
to
give
you
insurance
in
case
you
are
disabled.
you
didn't
have
to
pay
that
charge
in
order
to
get
the
credit.
and
it's
a
separate
service
entirely.
it's
not
for
the
extension
of
credit.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
if
it...
if
it
was
a
condition
of
providing
the
credit
in
the
first
place,
it
was
required
and
it
is
integral
to
the
making
available
of
the
credit,
then
in
that
situation...
which
is
not
the
ordinary
case...
in
that
situation
it
might
be
interest.
that's
not
the
ordinary
case,
which
is
why
i
believe,
in
the
occ
regulation,
it
is
not
considered
ordinarily
interest,
and
we
do
not
normally...
we
do
not
consider
it
ordinarily
interest,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
the
key
question
is:
is
this
a
price
that's
being
charged
for
actually
making
available
credit
and
for
the
use
and
detention
of
the
bank's
money?
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
if...
if
what
mr.
donovan
is
saying
is
that
our
definition
is
inclusive
of
all
charges
that
are
for
the
use
or
detention
of
money,
then
we
would
say
that
that
definition
has
a
proud
history
in
the
usage
of
the
term
"interest",
the
usage
of
the
term
"rate",
the
statutory
history,
the
statutory
purpose,
and
the
administrative
agencies'
interpretation.
so
we
are
not
suggesting
that
charges
that
are
not
for
those
purposes
constitute
interest,
but
we
do...
we
do
believe...
and...
and
this
court
has...
has
a
definition
since
the
mid-19th
century
that
interest
is...
is
what
a
lender
is
charging
for
the
use
and
detention
of
money.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
there
are
two...
two
ways
in
which
it...
it
helps
us.
there...
there
are
two
points
that
are
made
in
that
opinion.
the
opinion,
first,
addresses
whether
the
method
of
compounding
that
was
used
by
the
bank
violated
the...
violated
section
85
because
it
exceeded
the
method
of
compounding
permitted
by
the
home
state.
and
the
answer
was,
by
justice
holmes,
yes.
because
instead
of
compounding
only
once
per
year,
which
was
his
analysis
of
what
the
state
required
as
to
the
unit
of
time,
the
bank
had
compounded
oftener
than
that.
and
so
i
offer
that...
that
part
of
donnell
for
the
proposition
that
the
law
of
the
state
as
to
the
method
of
computation
is
adopted
by
section
85.
in
other
words,
that...
that
question--
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
--correct.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
and
then,
of
course,
donnell
also
makes
another
point
which
is
very
important.
which
is
that
a
charge,
even
if
it
could
be
labelled
a
penalty,
because
it's
too
high
in
someone's
estimation,
is
still
interest
and
thus
that...
what
the
parties
contended...
what
the
borrower
was
contending
was...
what
the
bank,
excuse
me,
was
contending
was
penal
interest
and
therefore
not
usurious,
not
covered
by
section
85.
they
lost
that
argument,
justice
holmes
saying
you
have
to
forfeit
all
of
that
interest.
it
is
interest
even
though
it
was
penal.
and
of
course,
this
court,
in
library
of
congress
against
shaw,
has
said
the
same;
that
the
character
of
interest
does
not
change
even
if
a
charge
could
aptly
be
called
a
penalty.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
requires
a
meaning
of
interest
that
would,
for
example,
prevent
a
state
where
a
bank
is
located
from
saying
to
a
credit
union,
you
can
charge
late
fees,
but
not
giving
that
privilege
to
other
lenders.
because
then
we
could
become
the
least-favored
lender
in
the
state.
interest
has
to
have
a
capacious
definition
for
the
purpose
of
capturing
those
lending
charges
that
could
be
the
basis
for
discrimination.
this
court
has...
in...
in
the
tiffany
case,
in
the
marquette
case,
shown
that
the
congressional
purpose
to
favor
national
banks
has
to
be
respected
in
understanding
the
meaning
of
the...
of
the
statutory
terms.
the
case
comes
to
the
court
on
this
issue
of
the
meaning
of
the
term
"rate
of
interest",
with
not
only
the
history
of
the
word
"interest",
the...
the
word
"rate",
which
black's
law
dictionary
defines,
without
any
reference
to
the
form
of
a
charge,
as
simply
the
amount
of
a
charge.
noah
webster,
in
1828,
a
similar
definition:
price
or
amount
stated
or
fixed
on
anything.
what
i
would
want
to
emphasize
is
that
the
term
"rate
of
interest",
that
was
simply
the
cap...
that...
that
is
the
way
that
states,
and
then
the
federal
government,
went
about
regulating
the
amount
that
could
be
charged.
the
term
"rate"
and
"amount"
is
used
interchangeably
in
the
statute.
the
last
sentence
of
the
statute,
which
happens
to
deal
with
foreign
bank
branches...
branches
of
national
banks
located
outside
the
united
states...
uses
those
terms
interchangeably.
mr.
richard
b.
kendall
that's
right,
your
honor.
