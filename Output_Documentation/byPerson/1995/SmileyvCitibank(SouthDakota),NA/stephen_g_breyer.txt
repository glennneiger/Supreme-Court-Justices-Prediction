does
the
administrative
fee,
the
$15,
have
to
bear
some
reasonable
relationship
to
the
administrative
cost?

suppose
it
bears
no
relationship
to
the
administrative
cost
associated
with
the
lateness.

if...
if
you're
breaking
out
of
the
9
percent
they
normally
charge
that
portion
of
the
9
percent
that
reflects
not
the
payment
for
refraining
from
consumption,
but
the
payment
for
the
associated
administrative
costs,
and
charging
it
in
the
form
of
a
flat
fee...
if
that's
the
theory
of
what's
going
on,
how
could
you
justify
an
excessive
amount?
and
if
it
isn't
the
theory
of
what's
going
on,
what
is?
