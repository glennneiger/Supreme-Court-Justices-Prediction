chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-860,
barbara
smiley
v.
the
citibank
of
south
dakota.
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
thing
the
controller
gave
as
a
reason:
i
think
the
banks
want
this.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
donovan.
mr.
kendall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
that
analysis
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
statute.
the
statute
talks
about
a...
a
rate
of
interest.
and,
you
know,
you
can
have
all
sorts
of
hypothetical
examples
that
posit
one
situation
and
posit
another.
but
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
a
late
charge
that
is
not
based
on
the
amount
that
is
overdue
and
that
is
not
based
on
any
stated
rate,
as
compared
to
a
percentage
of
interest
on...
on,
say,
a
loan
of
$1,000.
you
say
you're
going
to
charge
him
7
percent
or
2
percent
per
month
or
something.
there...
there
is
that
difference.
and
all
the
hypotheticals
in
the
world
don't
obscure
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
you're
talking
about
the
state
statutes
as
of
1864,
when
this
was
enacted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
alternative--
--you
say...
you
say
it
happens
to
be
there?
[laughter]
it
moved,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
this
mean
that
every...
every
charge
made
by
the
bank
against
the
$1,000,
say,
that's
loaned,
has
to
be
considered
interest?
i
mean,
supposing
that
a
bank
says,
we're
going
to
charge
you
$15
for
quick
processing.
in
other
words,
you
pay
us
$15
and
you
can
have
your
loan
processed
in
5
days.
other
people
have
to
wait
30
days.
now,
is
that
interest?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
if
the
bank
says
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
$40
for
an
insurance
premium
on
your
life?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how...
how
can
you
tell
which
is
the
separate
service
and
which
isn't?
how
can
you
tell
the...
the
separate
service
in
the
first
hypothetical
isn't
the
quick
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
understand
that
when
the
thing
comes
in
the
mail
after
the
loan
is
complete.
but
if
the
bank
asked
it
right
at
the
time,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
distinction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
mr.
gornstein,
i've
been
on
the
court
23
or
24
years
and
heard
a
number
of
these
cases.
and
i've
never
heard
of
a
case
in
which
the
comptroller
ruled
against
the
banks.
[laughter]
do
you
know
of
any?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
gave
an
interpretive
regulation
which
was
adverse--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr....
mr.
gornstein,
this
statute
came
on
the
books,
i
guess,
what,
1864?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
comptroller
never
had
a...
a
regulation
until
february
of
this
year?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
one
in
february
1955?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
donovan,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
donovan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
