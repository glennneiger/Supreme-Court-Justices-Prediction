mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
issued
an
interpretive
regulation
concluding
that
late
fees
are
interest.
our
position
is
that
the
comptroller's
interpretation
is
reasonable
and
that
under
established
principles
of
administrative
deference,
the
court
should
defer
to
that
interpretation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
do
i
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
comptroller
has
ruled
against--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--adverse
to
the
banks?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i...
i
would
suggest
that
this
very
regulation
that
you
find
here
favors
the
banks
in
some
respects
and
does
not
favor
the
bank
in
other
respects.
and
so...
because
some
of
the
charges
are...
are
treated
as
interest
and
some
are
not,
whereas
probably
the
banks
would
like
to
have
all
of
them
treated
as
interest
so
that
they
could
be
exported.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
comptroller
has
the
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
national
banks
comply
with
all
provisions
of
the
national
bank
act,
including
the
limit
set
on
taking
interest
in
section
85.
section
85
says
that
a
bank
can
take
no
more
interest
than
the
most
favored
lender
in
the
state
in
which
the
bank
is
located.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
he
does.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that...
that's
right.
that
under...
because
of
that
enforcement
responsibility,
under
this
court's
decisions
in
chevron
and
in
nationsbank,
that
carries
with
it
the
authority
to
issue
reasonable
interpretations
of
the
meaning
of
interest
under
section
85.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
souter.
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--under
the
statute,
it
has
to
be
based
on
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
bank
is
located
to
determine
whether
the
fee
is
excessive
or
not,
once
it
is
interest.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is
still
interest,
and
it
is
excessive
interest
by
some
states'
standards...
perhaps
california's...
but
it
is
not
excessive
interest
when
judged
by
south
dakota's
standards,
where
the
national
bank
is
located.
the
second--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--on
a
late
fee,
it
is...
the
comptroller
concluded
that
a
late
fee
does
two
things,
at
least.
one,
it
accounts
for
the
increased
risk
that
somebody
who
pays
late
presents
to
the
bank.
it
is
a
bigger
credit
risk,
and
therefore
banks
want
to
charge
a
higher
rate
of
interest
to
account
for
that
risk.
and
the
second
thing
the
comptroller
concluded
that
the
late
fee
accounts
for
is
the
administrative
costs
associated
with
that.
but
once
you--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
that...
that
you...
again,
there
are
two--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you
do
not
look
to
state
law
to
determine
that.
you
look
to
just
the
percentage
ceiling
and
you
look
to
the
rate
it
charges--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--together
with
whatever
late
fee
they
impose,
to
see
whether
that
exceeds
the
percentage
ceilings
set
under
the
federal
standard.
the
state
law
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
believe
it
hardly
ever
operates.
i'm
told
that
it
may
operate
in
arkansas,
still,
where
there
is
a
constitutional
limitation
on
the
taking
of
interest,
but...
above
a
certain
amount...
but
everybody
else,
i
believe,
is
following
the...
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
bank
is
located.
the...
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
here
is
that
the
comptroller
reasonably
started
with
the
premise
that
a...
interest
in
the
lending
context
could
potentially
include
any
charge
for
the
use
or
the
detention
of
money.
that
is
the
formulation
that
this
court
adopted
in
brown
against
hiatt
at
around
the
time
that
the
statute
was
enacted.
and
it
was
clearly
not
unreasonable
for
the
comptroller
to
adopt
that
same
basic
approach
to
the
meaning
of
"interest".
the
third
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
comptroller
here
did
reasonably
conclude
that
late
fees
are
interest.
a
late
fee
is
a
charge
that
a
borrower
pays
as
a
condition
of
receiving
an
extension
of
credit.
it
is
imposed
when
the
borrower
fails
to
pay
on
time.
it
is
part
of
the
price
for
using
the
credit
card,
and
therefore
reasonably
viewed
as
a
charge
for
the
use
of
detention
of
money.
and
the
final
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
comptroller
reasonably
determined
that
it
should
not
make
any
difference,
for
purposes
of
section
85,
whether
the
late
fee
is
charged
as
a
percentage
of
the
outstanding
balance
or
whether
it
is
charged
at
a
flat
rate,
such
as
$15
per
month.
that
is
a
matter
of
form
rather
than
substance.
if
you
have
a
state
which
has,
for
example,
a
10
percent
limit
on
late
fees
and
you
have
a
borrower
with
a
balance
of
$100,
it
should
not
make
any
difference
whether
a
national
bank
charges
15
percent
late
fees
or
a
$15
flat
late
fee.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
no,
i...
i...
i
take
that
back.
the
comptroller
did
have
a
regulation
on
the
books,
which
is
still
part
of
the
regulation
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i...
i
cannot
give
you
the
date
on
the
other
regulation.
but
at
page
3a
of
our
brief,
where
it
says
(b)
authority>
["],
it...
it...
it
ran
something
like
the
second
sentence
of
that,
which
is:
if
state
law
permits
interest
charges
on
specified
classes
of
loans,
a
national
bank
making
such
loans
is
subject
only
to
the
provisions
of
state
law
relating
to
that
classes
of
loans
that
are
material
to
the
determination
of
the
permitted
interest
rate.
and
in
deciding
a
lot
of
questions
about
what
was
or
wasn't
interest
before
the
issuance
of
this
regulation,
the
judgment
was
made
about
whether
it
was
quote,
unquote,
material
to
the
determination
of
the
rate
of
interest
that
the
innovation
of
this
regulation,
which
was
built
on
the
1995
williams
letter
that
preceded
it,
which
stated
the
comptroller's
view,
was
to
adopt
a
federal
definition
of
interest
that
tracked
this
court's
definition
in
brown
v.
hiatt
as
the
basic
concept
of
interest,
but
to
still
leave
the
material
to
the
determination
of
interest,
but
not
have
it
play
so
big
a
role
in
determining
what
the
meaning
of
interest
was
under
section
85.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
