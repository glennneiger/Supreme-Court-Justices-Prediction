but
i...
i
thought
that
interest
historically
a
payment
for
damages...
originally...
was
a
payment
for
damages
for
the
money
that
wasn't
paid
in
time.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
charge
that's
in
question
here
fits
very
well
within
that
definition.
is
your
point
that
our
understanding
of
interest
or
the
meaning
of
interest
changed
from,
say,
the
1700's
to
the
time
when
of
the
civil
war,
when
this
statute
was
enacted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we'll
accept
that
in...
in
the
context,
i
suppose...
i
don't
know
if
the
argument
has
been...
been
made...
of
ease
of
administration.
a
flat
charge,
it
seems
to
me,
may
very
well
reflect
the
cost
to
the
lender
of
administering
a
large
scheme
like
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
should
there
be
a
difference
if
it's
in
addition
in...
in...
in...
or
in
lieu
of?
you...
you
suggested
if
it's
in
lieu
of,
it
would
be
permissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
it
cease
to
be
interest?
it's
just
greater
interest,
it
seems
to
me.
