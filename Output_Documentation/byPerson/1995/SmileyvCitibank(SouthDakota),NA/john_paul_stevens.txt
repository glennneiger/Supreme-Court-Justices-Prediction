john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a...
a
slightly
changed
version
of
justice
ginsburg's
question.
forget
about
the
$15
for
a
moment
and
assume
the
charge
was
1
percent
of
the
arrearage
on
the
30th
day
of
the
month,
period.
regardless
of
how
long
the
arrearage
was
taking
place,
but
every
30th
day,
it's
1
percent.
would
that
be
an
interest
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
that
was
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
mr.
donovan,
don't
you
have
a
simpler
answer
to
that
example?
it
also
is
not
a
function
of
the
time
that
the
arrearage
is...
is
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
your...
your
basic
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
one-time
charge.
and
your...
your
answer
is
one-time
charges
are
never
a
rate
of
interest;
they
always
have
to
be
a
function
of
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
be
irrational
if
the
banks
want
it?
because
it
makes
banks
generally
more
solvent
and
more
profitable
and
so
forth,
it
protects
depositors.
i
mean
you
could
add
a
little
language,
but
the
basic
bottom
line
is
banks
want
it
because
they
think
it's
healthy
for
the
banking
industry.
why
is
that
irrational?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
you're
doing
is
taking
out
the
expertise
of
the
agency
in
regard
to
what's
good
for
the
banking
industry
and
so
forth.
that...
it
just
has
to
be
an
expert
in
reading
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
fine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
right.
he
said
it's
not
interest
unless
it's
based
on
the
function
of
time.
i
asked
him
that
very
question.
because
i
was
unclear
from
his
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
if
it's
a
function
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
per
period
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
again
why
you
think
the
citizens
national
bank
opinion
by
holmes
helps
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
caught
your
point
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that's
where
the
law
of
the
state
prohibited
rather
than
permitted
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i...
i
see
your
point
there.
