justice
antonin
scalia
that's
still
done
now,
isn't
it?
that...
that's
not
disappeared?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
that
shows
that
it
does
include
that
kind
of
interest,
the...
the
normal
kind,
but
it
doesn't
show
that
it
excludes
the
other
kind.
the
trouble
i
have
with
your
position,
mr.
donovan,
is
i
don't
see
how
effective
this
provision
in
the
bank
act
would
be,
which
was
intended
to
be
a
usury
provision,
if
it
said
it's
perfectly
okay
so
long
as
you
put
in
the
loan
agreement
"interest
shall
be
6
percent
per
year,
plus
$10
a
week
no
matter
what
the
outstanding
balance
is.
"
i
mean
that
would
be
wonderful
usury,
and
it...
and
it
would
not
at
all
be
protected
by...
protected
against
by
section
85.
i...
i
cannot
believe
that
that's
what
congress
intended.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
any
bank
could
charge
10
bucks
a
week
on
the
outstanding
balance?
justice
antonin
scalia
not...
not
matter
what
the
outstanding
balance
was,
you
pay
$10
a
week
to
the
bank;
they
could
do
that
under
this
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
based
on--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
to
do
both;
didn't
you
say
you
have
to
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it
wouldn't
be
covered
by
your
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
california
didn't
prohibit
that.
maybe
that's
why
it
wasn't
in
your
complaint.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr....
mr.
donovan,
you're...
you're
hinging
your...
your
whole
argument
upon
"at
the
rate
allowed".
but,
you
know,
any
flat
charge
can
be
expressed
as
a
rate.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
state
law
that
says
you
may
charge
$100
a
year
on
any
loan,
you
know,
$100
loan
processing
charge
may
be...
may
be
applied
to
any
loan.
you
there
have
a
state
law
which
allows
interest
at
the
rate
of
$100...
at
the
rate
of
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
would
know
what
the
maximum
rate
it
allows,
assume
a...
assume
a
1
penny
loan.
you
know,
as
much
as
you
have
to
multiply
1
penny
to
get
$100,
that's
the
rate.
any...
any
flat
amount
can
be
converted
into
a
rate,
once
you
know
what
the...
what
the...
you
know,
what
the
outstanding
loan
that
the
flat
amount
is
applied
to
is.
it's...
it's
simply
a
matter
of
mathematics.
any
flat
amount
is...
is...
is
a
rate
of
the
loan
to
which
it
is
applied.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
why
can't
the
statute
be
read
that
way,
"interest
at
the
rate"?
now,
if
you
have
a
flat
fee
that's
permitted
by
state
law,
you
can't
go
above
the
rate
that
that
flat
fee
would
amount,
assuming
the
smallest
possible
loan.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
crucial?
why
do
you
have
to
be
able
to
calculate--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
my
point
is
that
you...
you
derive
that
argument
from
the
word
"rate",
and
that
it...
that...
it
need
not
be
derived
from
the
word
"rate",
because
you
can
convert
a
flat
charge
into
a
rate,
once
you
know
what
the
amount
that
the
flat
charge
is
applied
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
but
we're
only
looking
for
the
maximum
rate
that
the
state
allows.
so
all
you
have
to
figure
out
is
the
shortest
amount
of
time
to
which
this
could
possibly
apply
under
state
law,
and
the
smallest
amount
of
money
to
which
this
could
possibly
apply
under
state
law,
and,
voila,
you
have
the
maximum
rate
allowed
by
state
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kendall,
i
think...
the
biggest
problem
i
have
with...
with
your...
with
your
case
is
that
i
don't
see
how
the...
how
the
alternative
set
forth
in
the
statute
makes
sense
unless
you're
dealing
with
a
charge
that
is
expressed
as
a
rate.
that
is
to
say,
section
85
reads
that
any
national
bank
may...
may
charge
interest
at
the
rate
allowed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
where
the
bank
is
located
or...
here's
the
alternative...
or
at
a
rate
of
1
percent
in
excess
of
the
discount
rate
on
90-day
commercial
paper,
whichever
may
be
greater.
that
alternative
doesn't
make
any
sense
when
it's
applied
to
a
flat
$1,000
charge.
and...
and
that
suggests
that...
that
what
goes
before
the
alternative
only
describes
nonflat
charges.
do
you
understand
my
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
right,
it
happens
to
find
itself
in
a
state,
how
about
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
convert
to
a
rate,
in
other
words,
as...
as
i
was
discussing
earlier
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
before
you
go
on,
let
me
ask
you
how
that
works
if...
suppose
you
have
a
state
that,
on
all
loans,
allows
a
5...
no
matter
what
the
amount
of
the
loan,
anybody
can
charge
a
$500
loan...
loan
servicing
charge
or
whatever.
now,
how
do
you
convert
that
into
the
alternative
clause?
that
means,
you
know,
1
penny
for
what...
1
penny
for
1
year,
i
guess
1
penny
for
1
day
and
$500
is
the
interest
on
that.
wow,
that's
a
very
high
rate.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
my...
and
that
means
that
the
alternative
"or",
you
know,
the...
my
goodness,
the
state...
the
state
interest
would...
would
have
no
usury
limit
at
all
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
it
works.
if...
well,
let's
assume
that...
that...
that
the
smallest
amount
of
money
for
the
shortest
amount
of
time,
with
a
$500
minimum
flat
charge,
amounts
to
a
million
percent
interest.
i...
i
don't
know
what
it
does.
let's
say
it
amounts
to
a
million
percent
interest.
that
means
that
any
state
that
allows
a
500
percent...
a
$500
flat
charge
permits
interest
at
the
rate
of
a
million
percent.
is...
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
do
you
have
to
consider
not
interest
in
gross,
but
you
have
to
say,
oh,
only
flat
charges
of
the
same
type
that
the
state
allows
can
be
charged
at
that
rate?
justice
antonin
scalia
along
with
the
rate
goes
the
manner.
i
mean
if...
if...
if
a
state
allows
a
million
percent
as
a
late
charge,
you
couldn't
charge
a
million
percent
as
something
other
than
a
late
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
thank
you,
mr.
kendall.
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is...
why
is
this
a
matter
that
the
comptroller
must
resolve
for
himself
in
performing
his
duties
under
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
has
enforcement
responsibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
must
interpret
it
in
the
course
of
executing
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
state
does
not
allow
a
late
fee,
how
do
you
decide
whether,
in
charging
a
late
fee,
a
bank
violates
the
rate
specified
in
the
statute...
namely,
1
percent
above
whatever
it
is?
do
you
follow
me?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
rate
is
the
alternative.
it's
either
that
or
the
federally
specified
rate,
whichever
is
higher.
now,
how
do
you
know
whether
a
$15
late
fee
violates
the
federally
specified
rate?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
in
practice,
does
that
federal
limit
ever
operate
or
is
it
nowadays
that
the
bank
picks
a
state
and
the
state--
