justice
david
h.
souter
given
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
why
don't
you
try...
why
don't
you
challenge
the
50-cent
charge
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
think
it's
the
minimum
finance
charge,
isn't
it.
no
matter
what
your
balance
is,
you've
got
to
pay
at
least
50
cents
a
month,
isn't
that
what
it
provides?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that...
if
you're
correct,
that...
that
is
forbidden,
too,
or
that
is
not
covered
by
the...
by
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
just
like
the
$15
in
justice
ginsburg's
example?
it's
a
floor.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it's...
it's
a
floor
without
reference
to...
to
a
particular
amount
over
a
particular
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
would
be
outside
the
statute,
just
as
the
$15
would
be,
isn't
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
comptroller
actually
monitor
these
rates?
is
there
an
office
down
there
that's
keeping
track
of
all
the
rates
that
are
being
charged?
