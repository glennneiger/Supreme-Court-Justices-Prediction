mr.
donovan,
suppose
that
citibank,
instead
of
having
a
flat
$15
a
month
late
payment
said
the
late
payment
is
1
percent
on
arrears,
but
not
less
than
$15;
would
that
then
qualify
as
an
interest
rate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
instead
of
the
$15
a
month...
you're
in
arrears,
the
$15
a
month
no
matter
what
the
balance
is...
instead,
the
provision
is
1
percent,
but
not
less
than
15.
so
it
could
be
more,
but
it's
going
to
be
at
least
15.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would.
but
for
people
who
would...
it...
it
would
have
to
be
at
least
$15.
if
it...
the
1
percent
turns
out
to
be
less
than
$15,
you
still
have
to
pay
$15.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
less
than,
the
floor.
the
15
is
the
floor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
wouldn't
object
to
a
flat
amount
as
a
ceiling,
would
you?
i
mean
you
explained
to
me
that
you
would
as
a
floor.
but
suppose
it's
2
percent,
but
never
more
than
$50
a
month;
that
would
be
okay,
even
though
the...
the
$50
is
a...
is
a
flat
amount,
as
opposed
to
what
you
call
a
rate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
two
percent
of
the
arrears,
but
never
more
than
$50
a
month.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
arrears.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i'm...
i'm
just
giving
you,
in
both
cases,
what
you
define
as
interest,
but
in
one
case
with
a
flaw
and
the
other
case
with
a
cap.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
donovan,
are
we
talking
about
something
that
would
be
eminently
fixable
by
citibank
if
it
said,
forget
federal
law,
we're
going
to
put
a
choice-of-law
clause
into
every
application,
credit
application,
and
we're
going
to
say
that
all
terms
and
conditions
of
this
agreement
shall
be
construed
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
south
dakota.
so
this
agreement
is
governed
by
the
law
of
south
dakota,
which
permits
these
charges.
would
that
be
binding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
how
do
you
answer
mr.
donovan's
argument
that
you
could
put
all
these
extra
charges
in,
and
you
could
call
everything
interest,
it
would
all
fit
into
your
definition?
