well,
mr.
donovan,
if...
if
the
term
"interest"
is
open
to
some
interpretation,
there
either
is
or
is
going
to
be,
i
gather,
a
comptroller's
interpretation
of
the
term.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
that,
where
it
will
expressly
include
late
fees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
required
that
sort
of
thing
before
we
defer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
that
banking
metropolis
of
rapid
city.
right.
