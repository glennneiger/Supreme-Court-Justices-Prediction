justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
gather
before
firrea
was
even
passed,
the
executive
branch
was
concerned
about
this
problem
and
induced
some
solvent
banks
to
take
on
their
backs
some
insolvent
banks
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
failing.
isn't
that
what
this
is
all
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
want
to
convince
us
that
these
bankers
and
lawyers
who
signed
this
agreement
put
themselves
in
a
visibly
insolvent
state
at
a
time
when
there
was
clearly
a
crisis
in
the
s&l
industry
and
congress
was
clearly
going
to
take
some
action,
visibly
put
themselves
in
an
insolvent
condition
without
any
commitment
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
not
count
that
against
them
for
purpose
of
shutting
them
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
is
so
utterly
implausible--
justice
antonin
scalia
--tell
me
why
this
is
not
unmistakable,
mr.
bender.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
provision
in
the
winstar
agreement...
i
think
it's
the
winstar
one.
the
statesman
agreement.
it
says...
it's
on
page
23
of
the...
set
forth
in
full
on
page
23
of
the
winstar
brief.
it
says,
in
the
case
of
any
ambiguity
in
the
interpretation
or
construction
of
any
provision
of
this
agreement,
such
ambiguity
shall
be
resolved
in
a
manner
consistent
with
such
regulations,
that
is,
including
future
regulations,
and
the
bank
board's
resolution
or
action
relating
to
the
acquisition,
the
mergers,
or
of
this
agreement.
if
there
is
a
conflict,
it
says,
between
such
regulations,
which
would
mean
future
regulations,
and
the
bank
board's
resolution
or
action
relating
to
the
acquisitions,
the
mergers,
or
this
agreement,
the
bank
board's
resolution
or
actions
shall
govern.
in
other
words,
the
bank
board's
resolution
that
approved
counting
this
as
capital--
justice
antonin
scalia
--shall
govern.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
sentence
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
see.
the
bank
board's
resolution
only
applies
to
counting
it
today.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
state...
i
was
talking
about
statesman.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
start
with
statesman.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
wrong
with
statesman?
you
say
that
there
is
no
conflict
if
a
future
regulation
contradicts...
a
future
regulation
contradicts
the
regulation
that
the
board
adopted
in
order
to
approve
this
transaction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--rendering
that
sentence
almost
utterly...
entirely
meaningless.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait,
if
the
government
says--
--has
anybody
ever
made
such
a
promise?
do
you
have
any
case
in
which
a
member
of
the
executive
branch
has
promised
that
congress
will
not
do
something?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
the
situation
in
which
you
contend
this
doctrine--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
inapplicable.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
in
that
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
just
congress?
why
not
the
agency?
i
thought
you
say
there's
no
agreement
here
at
all.
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--say
that
there's
an
agreement
not
to
change
our
regs
unless
we're
forced
to
change
it
by
law?
is
there
that
much
of
an
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
not
even
that
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
for
today--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we'll
say
you
can
do
it
for
40
years--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
tomorrow
we
may
change
our
mind.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
no
promise
at
all
even
with
respect
to
their
own
changing
of
their
own
regulations
the
next
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
not,
because
there's
no
relationship
between
the
safety
requirements
and
the
risk
of
insolvency
which
the
hospitals
have
acquired
by
taking
these
hospitals
that
are
being
sued
upon
their
back.
mr.
bender--
--here,
there
is
such
a
relationship.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bender,
isn't
any
contract,
not
only
by
the
government
but
by
a
private
person,
subject
to
the
condition
which
you
say
this
must
have
been
subject
to,
namely,
if
what
i
have
promised
becomes
unlawful,
of
course
i
won't
do
it?
i
mean,
to
say
that
this
agency,
if
it
was
a
promise,
would
have
been
conditioned
upon
that,
is
to
say
what
every
contract
is
conditioned
upon.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
the
clearest
language
you
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
--walk
me
through
that,
would
you?
you
begin
at
page
599?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
where's
that...
how
does
that
read?
justice
antonin
scalia
excepting
only--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay,
and
then
we
go
to
607,
and
what
do
we
see
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
commitment
of
the
accountant.
that's
not--
--that's
a
commitment
of
the
accountant.
right.
would
you
look
at
page
610?
what
does
the
resolved,
the
second
resolved
further,
on
page
610
of
the
appendix,
mean?
that
is
to
say
that
the
secretary,
assistant
secretary
is
authorized
and
directed
to
send
to
glendale
a
letter
concerning
scheduled
items
attributed
to
broward
and
the
forbearance
of
the
fslic
and
the
bank
board
with
respect
to
certain
regulatory
requirements,
a
copy
of
which
letter
is
in
the
minute
exhibit
file.
what
does
that
letter
cover?
justice
antonin
scalia
other
than
the
goodwill.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
always
mean
an
agreement.
i
mean,
i
can
say
right
now
i'll
stipulate
that
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
often
say,
he
stipulated
that.
i
mean,
it's
a
concession,
certainly,
by
one
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
can
glendale
submit
a
bilateral
document?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
if
it
said
glendale
shall
submit
and
the
board
shall
accept,
and
the
board
shall
sign,
then
you
would
have
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
have
been
in
violation
of
the
then-applicable
regs
of
the
board
if
that
stipulation
did
not
also
constitute
a
commitment
by
the
board?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
under--
--i'm
not
talking
about
the
memorandum.
i'm
talking
about
the
stipulation.
where
is
the
stipulation
that
was
submitted?
where
is
that?
is
that
here
in
the
appendix
somewhere?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
maybe
you
don't
understand
my
question.
it
says,
glendale
shall
submit
a
stipulation.
i
assume
a
stipulation
was
submitted.
where
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
it?
i'd
like
to
read
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
in
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
623--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
your
other
client?
just
to
be
sure
that
i
have...
what
about
the
agreement
for
winstar?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
was
the
statesman
contract,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
winstar?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
about
the
bank
board's
resolution
to
which
this
refers?
where
does
that
appear,
and
how
does
that
close
the
loop?
justice
antonin
scalia
precisely
what
did
the
government
promise?
precisely,
the
government
promised
to
let
you
continue
to
do...
what
it
boils
down
to
is,
they
promised
to
let
you
continue
doing
business
as
a
bank
so
long
as
you
maintained
that
minimum
level
of
capital
that
these
accounting
principles
would
produce.
is
that
the
essence
of
the
promise?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
care
how
they
calculate
it.
you
care
that
they
let
you
continue
to
do
business
as
a
bank,
so
you're
saying
they
gave
you
a
sort
of
a
charter,
a
promise
that
your
bank
charter
wouldn't
be
yanked
so
long
as
you
kept
your
capital
the
way
these
accounting
principles--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
require.
