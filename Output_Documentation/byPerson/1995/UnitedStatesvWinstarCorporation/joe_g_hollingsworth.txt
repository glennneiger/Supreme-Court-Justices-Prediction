mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
mr.
bender
refers
to
and
what
his
reply
brief
referred
to,
and
it
did
so
by
referencing
a
law
review
article
in
a
1993
government
report,
is
a
hypothesized
thrift
which
does
not
exist
on
this
record.
it's
this
court's
purpose
now
to
determine
what
the
intent
of
the
parties
was
in
1981,
and
the
hypotheticals
about
what
a
government
report
said
the
intent
of
other
thrifts
besides
glendale
was
in
1981
are
not
admissible.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
mr.
chief
justice,
the
unmistakability
doctrine
requires
a
clear
promise,
and
clear
authority,
and
interpreting
the
clear
promise,
this
court's
precedents
have
held
that
the
court
can
look
to
the
plain
meaning
and
can
interpret
the
plain
meaning
of
what
the
parties
intended
from
the
language
of
the
contract
and
from
the
circumstances
under
which
the
contract
was
made.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
it
requires
a
clear
promise,
a
clear
promise
in
a
contract
where
you're
dealing
with
the
government
where
there
is
a
regulatory
promise
at
issue,
and
of
course--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor,
and
if
the
court
refers
to
page
32
of
our
brief,
the
court
will
see
the
references
to
cases
in
which
the
course
of
dealing
with
the
parties
is
also
used
to
construe
the
plain
meaning
of
the
contract.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
now,
that
may
not
be
the
same
as
implication.
we're
not
arguing
here
that
there
is
some
implied
contract,
or
implied
warranty,
or
implied
indemnity.
we're
showing
the
court
that
there
was
an
expressed
contract
here,
that
its
terms
were
in
the
clearest
possible
terms,
as
both
lower
courts
held,
and
that
the
government
had
authority
to
do
what
it
did.
that's
the--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--the
clearest
language
we
have,
your
honor,
is
that
the
integration
clause
makes
the--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--yes,
i
can,
your
honor.
the
integration
clause
appears
at
page
599
of
the
joint
appendix.
that
clause,
your
honor,
makes
the
resolution...
and
the
resolution
page
i'm
referring
to
is
at
page
607
of
the
joint
appendix.
that
clause,
the
integration
clause,
makes
the
resolution
a
"agreement
between
the
parties",
and
the
resolution
sets
forth
the
promise
of
the
parties
that
goodwill
would
be
treated
as
an
asset
for
purposes
of
determining
regulatory
capital,
and
that
promise
is
set
forth
in
the
requirement
that
goodwill
shall
be
established
based
on--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--yes,
i
will,
sir.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
at
page
599--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--is
the
integration
clause
and
the
supervisory
action
agreement.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
that
clause
says
that
the
agreement
of
the
parties
is...
is
final.
prior
agreements
are
superseded
except
for--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--except
for,
justice
scalia,
letters
and
resolutions
entered
contemporaneously
with
the
agreement
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
and
that
resolution
appears
at
page
607
of
the
joint
appendix,
justice
scalia,
and--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--and
we
see
at
607,
in
paragraph
3,
a
requirement
that
glendale
shall
submit
a
letter
from
its
independent
accountant
that
shall
justify
the
use
of
purchase
method
accounting
which
allows
glendale
to
use
goodwill
as
an
asset,
which
shall
set
forth
the
amount
of
goodwill
in
accordance
with
the
accountant's
opinion,
and
which
shall
set
forth
the
duration
or
amortization
period
under
which
goodwill
shall
operate.
and
the
second
thing
that's
important
on
page
607,
justice
scalia,
is
a
requirement
that
glendale
shall
submit
a
stipulation,
a
stipulation
that
goodwill
resulting
from
this
merger
shall
be
determined,
which
means
shall
be
determined
now
and
for
the
future
in
accordance
with
a
regulation,
memorandum
r31b,
in
effect
at
the
time.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
well,
the
government
requires
that
glendale's
accountant,
glendale's
agent
memorialize,
in
effect,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
parties
agreed
to.
that
is--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--what
is
goodwill--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--well,
your
honor,
it
would
be
as
if
you
were
entering
a
contract
to
build
a
house,
and
you
agreed
with
the
contractor
that
an
architect's
certificate
would
be
provided,
and
the
parties
would
be
bound
by
that,
notwithstanding
that
it's
a
third
party,
and
in
government
contract
law,
your
honor--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--well,
it
is
a
certified
public
accountant
the
opinion
of
which
both
parties
agreed
would
finally
memorialize
what
the
final
determination
of
the
amount
of
goodwill
was,
that
is,
the
number
of
liabilities
of
broward
which
exceeded
the
assets
of
broward,
and
the
justification
for
the
40-year
term
under
purchase
method
accounting,
which
is
authorized
by
the
regulation,
which
is
adopted
by
reference.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
no,
your
honor,
it
is
the
goodwill
that
is
referred
to
both
in
paragraph
3
and
resulting
amortization
periods,
which
means
goodwill
for
the
future,
and
in
paragraph
4,
in
which
the
stipulation,
which
means
a
term
of
agreement
of
the
parties,
shall
say
that
goodwill
is
amortized
pursuant
to
the
government's
regulation,
which
is
memorandum
r31b.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
your
honor,
this
is
a
promise.
this
is
a
promise
that
was
made
as
part
of
a--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--paragraph
4
is
an
obligation
that
becomes
an
obligation
of
both
parties.
when
that
regulation--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--when
that
regulation
is
read
into
the
contract
as
adopted
by
reference,
as
our...
as
the
case
is
cited
in--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--as
describing
what
the
parties
have
agreed--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--as
what
glendale
must
do
and
what
the
parties
have
agreed
is
a
requirement--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--the
obligation
of
the
government
is
to
treat
that
goodwill--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--that
obligation
appears
in
memorandum
r31b,
which
permits
the
use
of
purchase
method
accounting
and
amortization
over
a
period
of
years,
and
it
appears,
sir,
in
the
accountant's
letter,
mr.
justice
stevens,
at
page
623
in
which
the
accountant--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--that
letter
covered
the
discount
of
assets
other
than
the
goodwill.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
that
is
a
stipulation
which
was--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--a
stipulation,
according
to
black's
dictionary,
is
an
agreement
of
the
parties,
a
stipulation
that
goodwill
will
be
treated
at
that
point
in
accordance
with
the
regulation.
that--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--that
stipulation
was
made
by
virtue
of
this
agreement,
to
which
the
parties
both
agreed
by
virtue
of
the
integration
clause--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--your
honor,
the
supervisory
action
agreement
is
signed
by
the
parties.
it
adopts
a
resolution.
there
is
no
stipulation
that
i
know
of
that
is
signed
by
the
government,
other
than
the
reference
in
this
contract
to
the
fact
that
the
parties
had
stipulated.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
not
that
i
know
of.
it's
a
term
of
law
in
contracts
which
imports
an
agreement
between
the
parties--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--and
this
stipulation
was--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--well--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--a
stipulation
is
a
bilateral
connotation,
i
think
that's
certain.
a
stipulation
is
bilateral,
and
the
parties
involved
here--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--because...
well,
because...
well,
this
document--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--the
board
had
the
right
to
reject
the
accountant's
letter,
and
it
didn't.
for
8
years
its
course
of
conduct
was
to
operate
in
accordance
with
the
accountant's
letter,
to
deduct
goodwill,
to
allow
goodwill
as
an
asset
for
purposes
of
regulatory
capital,
and
they
had
the
right
to
overturn
that
or
reject
that
accountant's
letter
by
this
contract,
and,
of
course,
they
did
not,
but
the
stipulation
draws
into
the
contract
the
regulation.
at
pages
21
to
24
of
our
brief
we
cite
this
court's
opinions
and
government
contract
opinions
in
particular
in
which
adoption
by
reference
is
standard
operating
procedure.
that's
what
this--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--the
then...
i
don't
think
we
would
have
been
in
violation
of
the
then-applicable
regs
of
the
board,
justice
scalia,
but
we
would
not
have
had
a
contract
had
we
not
had
a
stipulation
adopting
this
regulation
and
fixing
it
in
time
and
agreement
as
to
the
amount
of
goodwill,
as
to
the
duration
in
which
goodwill
could
be
amortized.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
what
obligated
the
government
not
to
change
the
regulations
is
two
things,
justice
stevens.
first,
it
is
a
stipulation
which
fixes
this
regulation
and
puts
the
burden,
or
puts
the
risk
of
nonperformance
on
the
government.
secondly,
there
is
another
clause--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--that
is
at
page
607.
by
stipulating
that
the
regulation
becomes
a
part
of
the
contract,
the
risk
of
nonperformance
of
that
regulation--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--this
document--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--this
document,
resolution
81-710,
refers
to
a
stipulation
on
the
bank
board
regulation
which
appears
at
joint
appendix
571.
that
becomes
a
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
the
stipulation
that
was
submitted
is
the
one
your
honor
is
looking
at.
the
accountant's
letter
memorialized
the
parties'
agreement
on
the
amount
of
goodwill
and
the
duration
under
which
goodwill
was
to
be
treated.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
that
stipulation
was
submitted
as
part
of
the
accountant's
letter.
the
accountant
was
glendale's
agent,
and
that's--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--that
letter,
your
honor--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--that
letter
appears
at
the
joint
appendix
page
623
and
624.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
actually,
that
is
an
attachment
to
the
accountant's
letter,
and
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
623,
623
states
that
this
determination
of
the
amount
of
goodwill
and
the
duration
of
goodwill
is
made
pursuant
to
the
supervisory
action
agreement,
and
i'm
looking
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
justice
scalia,
at
page
623.
that
is
the
stipulation
that
the
resolution
refers
to.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
your
honor,
that
is
expressly
incorporated
into
the
contract
by
virtue
of
the
stipulation
we've
been
referring
to.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
absolutely--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--and
it
is
expressly
incorporated
thereby.
also,
there
are
uncontradicted
facts
in
the
record
below,
including
affidavits
and
a
statement
of
uncontradicted
facts,
that
make
that
clear
as
well,
sir.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
i
think
that
the--
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
--i
think
your
honor
is
referring
to
a
provision
in
the
lower
court's
opinion
which
dealt
with
what
i
refer
to
as
a
second
promise
theory,
which
i
don't
think
any
decision
of
this
court
or
any
other
court
has
recognized.
what
the
lower
court
did,
however,
was
find
and
apply
the
unmistakability
doctrine
correctly
in
accordance
with
this
court's
prior
rulings
in
the
cases
the
government
relies
on,
and
it
did
so
and
found
that
the
contract
between
glendale
and
the
government
was
stated
in
the,
quote,
clearest
possible
terms.
they
did
so
in
accordance
with
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
unmistakability
doctrine.
mr.
joe
g.
hollingsworth
excuse
me,
your
honor.
thank
you.
