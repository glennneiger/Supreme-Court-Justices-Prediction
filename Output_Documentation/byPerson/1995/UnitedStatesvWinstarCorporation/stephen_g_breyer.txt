justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
see.
i
thought
they
did
it
in
order
to
save
the
congress
from
having
to
appropriate
more
money
to
pay
the
depositors
who
would
have
lost
money.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
unmistakability
doctrine?
i
mean,
my
thought
is
that
there
are
two
courts
that
have
said
they
did
make
a
promise,
at
least
one
that
gets
them
damages,
below
us--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
issue
is,
is
that
unmistakable,
and
my
question
on
the
unmistakability
doctrine
is
where...
what's
the
line
as
to
where
it
applies
and
where
it
doesn't?
that
is,
would
you
say
it
applies
if
the
government
promises
to
sell
somebody
2
tons
of
oil,
and
then
what
happens
is
an
environmental
reg
prevents
them
from
releasing
the
oil,
and
they
come
in
and
say,
we're
not
paying
damages?
suppose
the
government
promises
to
buy
a
piece
of
property,
and
the
law...
change
a
contract--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
buy
a
house,
and
the
government
says,
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
you
damages,
because
after
all,
it
doesn't
say
unmistakably,
and
i
will
pay
damages
if
later
on
a
regulation
on
property
law
makes
it
impossible
for
me
to
convey
the
house.
where
does
the
unmistakable...
where
does
it
apply,
where
doesn't
it
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
is
unmistakable,
if
it
isn't
unmistakable,
what
is
that
to
do
with
us?
i
thought
that
the...
i
may
be
wrong.
i
thought
that
the
lower
courts
held
the
historical
understanding
of
the
unmistakable
doctrine
is
not
applicable
to
this
issue,
and
therefore,
if
we
think
it
is
applicable,
we
have
to
send
it
back--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
if
we
think
it
isn't
applicable,
then
i
guess
you'd
win.
i
thought
that
was
the
issue,
whether
it
is
applicable
or
whether
it
isn't
applicable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
concede
that
it
has
to
be
unmistakable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
concede
that
to
win
you
have
to
show
the
promise
is
unmistakable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
only
issue
before
us
is
whether
or
not--
--no,
that's--
--is
that
any
different--
--that's
no
different
from
ordinary
contract--
--than
any
contract.
