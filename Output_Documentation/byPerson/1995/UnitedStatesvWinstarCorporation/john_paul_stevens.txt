justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
similar
to
the
chief
justice's?
this
paragraph
describes
an
obligation
of
glendale.
it
says
that
the
approval
is
conditioned
on
glendale
doing
these
things.
how
do
you
translate
that
into
a
commitment
by
the
government
that
if
you
do
these
things
you're
protected
for
40
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
what...
the
promise,
though,
that
you
referred
to
describes
an
obligation
of
glendale,
paragraphs
3
and
4
on
page
607.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
that
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
describing
what
glendale
must
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
glendale
must
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
the
provision
on
which
you
rely
describing
what
the
obligation
of
the
government
is
when
glendale
does
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where?
i
want
you
to
point
me
to
the
language
on
which
you
rely
for
that
obligation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
clearly
obligated
glendale
to
comply
with
those
regulations,
but
i
find...
i'm
trying
to
find...
i'm
sure
there's...
it's
in
here
somewhere,
but
i'm
trying
to
find
what
it
is
that
obligated
the
government
not
to
change
the
regulations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
where
is
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
congress
is
committed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
who
is
the
party
to
the
contract?
who
is
the
party
to
the
contract
that
you're
suing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
sovereign
make
the
contract?
i
thought
an
agency--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
is
no
longer
in
existence,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other--
--it
does
by
eliminating
sovereign
immunity,
by
reinstituting
sovereign
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
to
save
me
time
looking
for
it,
you
say
there's...
you
relied
heavily
in
the
statesman
contract,
the
stuff
on
page
23.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
do
i
find
the
corresponding
language
in
the
winstar
contract,
just
so
i
don't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
it's
probably
a
little
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
are
you
relying
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
so
i
know
where
to
find
the
corresponding--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--okay,
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
want
to
use
your
time
up.
i
just
wanted
to
know
where
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thanks.
