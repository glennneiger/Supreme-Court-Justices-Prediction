mr.
charles
j.
cooper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
scalia,
i
would
like
to
open
by
returning
to
the
examination
of
the
contract
documents
in
the
tatesman
case...
i
represent
statesman
and
winstar...
and
you
earlier
referred
to
page
23
of
our
brief.
i'd
like
to
pick
up
where
you
left
off,
if
i
may.
justice
scalia,
you
quoted
one
of
the
two
sentences
that
are
italicized.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
of
my
brief,
yes,
your
honor,
and
you'll
note
in
the
block
quote
there
that
the
last
two
sentences
of
that
block
quote
are
italicized.
justice
scalia
quoted
a
sentence
that
in
fact
the
government
omitted
from
its
discussion
of
this
provision,
which
is
absolutely
critical
to
understanding
the
importance
of
this
provision.
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
such
regulations
and
the
bank
board's
resolution
or
action
relating
to
the
acquisition,
the
mergers
for
this
agreement,
the
bank
board's
resolution
or
action
shall
govern.
your
honor,
mr.
bender
responded
that,
well,
that
means
the
regulations
at
the
time,
not
future
regulations,
and
that's
why
we've
also
italicized
the
following
sentence:
for
purposes
of
this
section,
the
accounting
principles
in
governing
regulations
shall
be
those
in
effect
on
the
effective
date
as
subsequently
changed,
amended,
clarified,
or
interpreted
by
the
bank
board.
your
honor,
the
parties
anticipated
this
very
dispute,
and
they
decided
it
right
then
and
there
at
the
closing
table.
they
decided
among
themselves.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
do,
because
we
are
not
seeking
to
hold
the
government
to
continue
to
count
our
goodwill,
to
continue
to
count
our
capital
credit.
that
is
not
part
of
our
claim.
it
couldn't
be
done
now
in
any
event.
we're
simply
suggesting,
as
justice
souter,
i
think,
has
correctly
read
this
very
provision,
that
it
placed
the
risk...
the
parties
understood
that
this
could
happen,
but
this
was
a
life-and-death
term
for
my
clients,
and
so--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--the
government
can't
break
this
agreement
without
any
cost,
exactly.
they
can't
visit
on
my
client's
shoulders
alone--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
i'm...
i
suspect
that
those
consent
decrees
are
not
involved
in
the
world
of
commerce,
which
is
what
these
contracts
were
involved
in.
we
had
the
government
acting
as
an
insurer
of
deposits.
it
was
the
one
who
was
on
the
hook
for
untold
millions
of
dollars
if
these
thrifts
that
we
took
off
their
hands
happened
to
fail,
and
they
had
to
pay
off
the
depositors.
we
came
to
the
table
with
cash
that
they
wanted.
your
honor,
if
we
had
added
in
the
next
sentence
of
this
clause
that
i've
been
reading
to
you
a
liquidated
damages
clause,
surely
no
one
would...
i
can't
imagine
the
proposition
that
that
would
be
invalid
as
well,
but
of
course
that
is
the
necessary
implication
of
the
government's
argument,
and--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor.
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that's
the
statesman
contract.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
with
respect
to
this
particular
provision,
winstar
had
a
virtually
identical
provision.
the
wording
of
the
two
sentences
that
i've
just
read
to
you
is,
i
think,
identical.
it's
certainly
not
in
any
material
way
different,
so--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor.
on
the
next
page
we've
set
that
out
as
well,
page
24
of
our
brief,
and
it
carries
over
to
page
25.
the
block
quote
begins
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
there,
and
the...
the
wording,
again,
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to,
this
whole
provision
is
key,
obviously.
it
contains
in,
i
think
the
courts
below
were
quite
correct,
the
clearest
possible
terms,
the
nature
of
the
regulatory
capital
promises
that
the
government
agreed
with
us
that
we
could
rely
upon.
but
the
wording
that
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
is
in
the
first
paragraph
there.
it
provides
that
the
acquisition
shall
be
accounted
for
and
shall
report
to
the
bank
board
and
the
fslic
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
as
accepted
modified,
clarified,
or
interpreted
by
applicable
regulations
of
the
bank
board
and
the
fslic,
okay,
so
they
had
to
report
according
to
gaap,
except
to
the
extent
that
their
regulations
changed
gaap.
the
next
phrase--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--from
time
to
time,
but
the
next
phrase,
again,
is
key,
indicating
we
anticipated
future
changes,
except
to
the
extent
of
the
following
departures
from
gaap,
so
again...
and
these
departures--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
think
it
modified
the
phrasing
that
went
before
it.
it
modifies
the--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
think
it
modifies
the
entire
provision
that
goes
before
it.
in
other
words,
the
parties
agreed
that
gaap
would
control
unless
they
regulated
a
difference
in
gaap,
but
that
these
particular
regulatory
promises
would
remain
constant,
because
again--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
think
that
is
true.
i
don't
represent
glendale,
but
i
don't
believe
that
contract
has
these
particular
provisions,
but--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
our
complaint
in
this
case
outlines
counts
under
theories
of
frustration
of
purpose
as
well
as
under
the
takings
clause
and
the
due
process
clause.
the
courts
below
didn't
need
to
get
to
constitutional
issues.
we
had
a
contract.
the
government
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
for
breaches
of
contract
in
the
tucker
act,
and
here
we
are.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
courts
below
well
and
correctly
understood
what
unmistakable
means.
the
unmistakable
doctrine,
unmistakability
doctrine,
your
honor,
truly,
if
reduced
to
a
sound
bite,
is
simply
that
the
government
cannot
be
held
to
promises
that
it
doesn't
make.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
unmistakability
cases
that
they
rely...
merrion.
what
was
at
issue
there?
a
tax
exemption
alleged
to
flow
in
connection
with
a
lease
for
oil--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--and
there
was
nothing
in
the
contract
about
taxes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
a
canon
of
construction
designed
to
aid
this
court
and
other
courts
in
divining
the
true
and
genuine
intent
of
the
contracting
parties.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
one
feature
that
it
does
bring
is
that
when
you
are
talking
about
a
contract
such
as
what
was
alleged
in
merrion
and
what
was
alleged
in
the
posse
case,
which
they
rely
prominently
on,
that
is,
a
contract
that
would,
indeed,
surrender
a
sovereign
authority,
there
the
taxing
authority
in
merrion,
the
court
approaches
that
with
some
skepticism,
and
so
it
requires
that
a
clear
expression
of
that
promise
take
place.
your
honor,
i
am
happy
to
live
with
the
unmistakability
doctrine
in
no
matter
how
rigid
a
formulation
except
theirs.
theirs
is
a
doctrine
invented,
your
honor,
for
the
purpose
of
saying
a
clear
and
plain
promise,
even
coupled
with
provisions
like
i
have
read
to
you,
is
inadequate,
because
it
isn't
also
coupled
with
the
further
promise
that
we
will
not
breach
those
promises.
we...
congress
is
committed
not
to
enact
a
law
that
changes
this
deal,
or
if
it
does--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--you're
immunized.
that's
their--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
the
sovereign
was
the--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--the
sovereign's
agent,
your
honors,
fslic
and
the
bank
board,
authorized--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
you
know,
these
contracts
also
recognized
that
possibility,
too,
and
suggested
that
these
provisions
were
binding
on
their
successors.
but
your
honor,
surely
the
congress
can't
avoid
it's
contractual...
or
the
sovereign
can't
avoid
its
contractual
obligations
by
simply
eliminating
and
extinguishing
its
agents.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
and
your
honor,
if
firrea
had
repealed
the
tucker
act
for
these
purposes,
i
would
have
a
much
tougher
case
here.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
we
don't
set
that
out
in
our
brief
because
the--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--or
at
least
the
accounting
principles
clause...
that
is,
the
one
on
page
23--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--is
virtually
identical.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
okay,
at
page
108
of
the
parties'
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
it
is
marked
as
section
10
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
it
begins
there.
that's
the
winstar
accounting
principles.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
see
that
my
time
has
almost
expired,
so
let
me
close
by
simply
saying
this.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
these
contracting
parties
are
simply
going
to
remain
in
the
places
that
they
are,
with
the
government
holding
$24
million
of
my
client's
money
in
its
pocket,
and
with
my
clients
with
a
$24
million
lesson
in
the
value
of
the
government's
solemn
contractual
oath.
if
there
are
no
additional
questions--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--they
promised
to
calculate
our
regulatory
capital
in--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
you
at
least
have
to
show
that
the
parties
attempted
but
failed
to
enter
into
a
binding
contract.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
think
that
even
if
mr.
bender
is
right
in
everything
that
he
says
and
we
don't
have
a
contract,
and
this
effort
was...
died...
was
a
failure
at
the
closing
table,
and
that
they
could
have,
as
they
say
they
could
have,
said
as
we
left
the
closing
table
$21
million
for
these
banks
is
not
enough,
we
want
more
capital,
and
we
would
have
no
protection
against
that,
and
again
he's
right
in
everything
he
says,
i
still
surely
am
entitled,
under
frustration
of
this
effort
to
make
a
contract,
to
my
money
back.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
the
final
pages
of
our
brief
we
cite
cases
that
make
clear
that
the
government
can't...
even
if
this
contract
was
void
in
its
beginning,
it
was
illegal,
there
was
no
authority
under
fslic
and
he's
right,
then
i
am
entitled
at
least
to
the
return
of
the
benefits
that
i've
given
them
under
the
pretense
of
this
false
contract.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
thank
you.
