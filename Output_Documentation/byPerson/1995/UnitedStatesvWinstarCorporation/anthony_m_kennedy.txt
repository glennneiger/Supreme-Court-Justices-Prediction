--at
a
time
when
not
only
they
but--
--when
you
say
assets,
i...
when
you
say
assets,
i
assume
you
mean
deposits
which
are
really,
in
effect,
a
liability,
as
everyone
knows.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
believe
that
if
these
documents
had
contained
a
clause
that
said
that
the
government,
or
fslic,
reserves
the
right
to
change
capital
requirements
and
not
to
count
this
goodwill,
that
these
parties
would
have
executed
the
agreement.
i
just
don't
believe
that
would
have
happened.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
contract
had
had
a
clause
specifically
allowing
the
government
to
do
what
it's
done
in
this
case,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
believe
that
the
parties
would
have
entered
into
the
transaction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
could
you
tell
me,
is
this
a
different
document
than
the
document
set
forth
in
winstar's
briefs
at
page
23,
or...
are
you
just
reading
other
parts
of
the
same
document,
or
are
you
referring
us
to
a
different
document?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying,
mr.
bender,
that
fslic
was
powerless
to
include
the
terms
that
the
respondents
now
claim
is
a
necessary
part
of
their
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
was
no
way...
there
was
no
form
of
language,
there
was
no
provision
that
fslic
was
authorized
to
include
which
would
reach
the
result
that
these
respondents
seek
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
treat
the
capital
the
same--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i'm
asking
about
fslic's
authority
to
make
the
contract
that
the
respondents
here
assert
was
made.
are
you
saying
that
fslic
could...
if
all
of
this
had
been
on
the
table
in
the
bargaining
session,
if
we
had
known
about
this
problem,
that
fslic
would
have
been
powerless
to
include
a
provision
that
gives
them
the
relief
they
now
want?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
hollingsworth,
may--
--is
the
goodwill
that
you
seek
to
amortize
here
the
goodwill
that's
referred
to
in
subparagraph
4
at
page
607,
or
is
that
something
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting
back
to
paragraph
4
on
page
607...
because
i'm
still,
as
the
chief
justice
and
justice
stevens
were
inquiring,
interested
as
to
the
government's
obligation...
glendale
shall
submit
a
stipulation.
is
that
some
sort
of
a
document
that's
signed
by
the
government
and
glendale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
a
stipulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
a
stipulation
submitted
that
required
the
government's
signature?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
stipulation
is
not
some
term
of
art
in
savings
and
loans,
it's
just
the
black's
law
dictionary
definition--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
cooper,
if
you
seek
damages
for
frustration,
restitution,
you
still
have
to
show
a
contract,
don't
you?
that
is
to
say,
the
measure
of
damages
doesn't
particularly
help
us
here,
does
it?
in
either
case
there
has
to
be
a
contract
that
was
a,
breached,
or
b,
frustrated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
the
contractual
inquiry
and
the
unmistakability
inquiry
the
same
in
either
case,
case
a,
breach,
damages
for
breach,
case
b,
restitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
what
theory?
you
still
have
to
have
a
contract,
don't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
sue
the
government
for
unjust
enrichment
and
restitution
under
