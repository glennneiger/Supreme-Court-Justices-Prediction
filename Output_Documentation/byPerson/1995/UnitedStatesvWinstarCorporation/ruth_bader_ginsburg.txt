mr.
bender,
are
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
arguing
to
any
extent
that
there
was
no
authority
in
the
executive
branch
to
make
such
an
agreement,
or
are
you
saying,
yes,
they
could
make
it,
but
it
had
to
be
unmistakable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
making
the
argument
that
they
couldn't
do
this
unless
congress
had
said
specifically,
and
you
can
guarantee
to
these
people
with
whom
you're
contracting
that
they
will
not
lose
the
benefit
of
their
bargain?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
congress
have
had
to
have
said
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cooper,
there's
one
thing
that
i'd
like
you
to
distinguish
for
me.
there
have
been,
i
think,
cases
involving
consent
decrees
both
in
the
environmental
area
and
the
civil
rights
area,
consent
decrees
signed
by
the
government
and
the
complaining
party,
and
then
when
the
administration
changed,
the
argument
was
made,
well,
yes,
the
government,
the
then-administrators
of
x
agency,
signed
that
document,
but
that's
not
the
policy
of
the
current
administration,
and
one
administration
can't
bind
another
to
a
policy
even
in
a
written
agreement
filed
in
the
court
and
made
a
part
of
a
consent
judgment.
now,
i
take
it
you
must
regard
this
situation
as
entirely
discrete
from
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
in
those
consent
decrees,
at
least
as
the
government's
argument
went,
there
would
be
no
responsibility
on
the
government's
part.
it
could
walk
away
from
the
agreement
as
if
it
had
never
been
made.
but
that's
not
what
you're
saying
here.
you
are,
of
course,
recognizing
congress'
authority
to
legislate.
however,
you're
saying
my
client
must
get
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
that
was
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what...
where
you're
saying
there's
a
difference
between
at
least
the
argument
that
was
made
that
the
government
could
walk
away
from
a
consent
decree
without
any
cost.
