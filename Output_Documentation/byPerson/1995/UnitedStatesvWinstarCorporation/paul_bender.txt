mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1989,
congress
enacted
firrea,
the
financial
institutions
reform,
recovery
and
enforcement
act
in
an
attempt
to
deal
with
the
calamity...
one
might
more
accurately
say
catastrophe...
that
had
befallen
the
savings
and
loan
or
thrift
industry
in
the
united
states
during
the
decade
of
the
1980's
largely
because
of
a
rise
in
interest
rates
at
the
beginning
of
the
1980's
and
then
because
of
the
risks
that
s&l
owners
took
in
order
to
make
more
money
to
deal
with
the
losses
that
were
caused
by
the
rise
in
interest
rates.
s&l's
are
invested
in...
were
invested
in
long
term
low
interest
things,
mortgages.
primarily
when
interest
rates
go
up
their
profit
and
loss
picture
tends
to
go
down
if
they're
stuck
with
those
long-term
debts.
during
that
decade,
about
a
sixth
of
all
the
s&l's
in
the
united
states,
about
500,
had
to
either
be
closed
or
absorbed
into
other
s&l's
because
they
were
insolvent,
because
they
failed.
that
accelerated
at
the
end
of
the
eighties.
about
half
of
those
failures
occurred
in
1987
and
1988.
the
costs
of
that
failure
are
enormous.
the
cost
in
money
to
the
insurance
fund...
which
is
in
turn,
was
in
turn
mostly
financed
by
premiums
that
the
banks
had
to
pay,
and
so
when
the
insurance
fund
loses
the
banks
have
to
pay
more
premiums,
and
that
spirals
the
losses...
the
cost
to
the
insurance
fund
was
over
$40
billion
in
those
closings.
the
cost
in
public
confidence
in
the
industry
is
probably
even
greater.
still
we
are
familiar
with
runs
on
banks
and
what
that
can
cause,
and
when
large
numbers
of
institutes,
one
in
six,
have
to
start
being
closed,
there
is
an
enormous
problem
of
possibly
failing
public
confidence.
the
public
at
the
end
of
the
eighties
had
$1.3
trillion
invested
in
s&l's,
and
s&l's
in
turn
are
there
because
congress
put
them
there
in
order
to
help
the
housing
market,
and
the
housing
industry,
and
make
housing
affordable.
mr.
paul
bender
it's
not
clear
who
induced
whom
in
these
transactions.
mr.
paul
bender
they
did
it
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it
was
the
policy
of
the
federal
bank
regulators
during
the
1980's
to
close
as
few
banks
as
possible
and
to
have
them
absorbed
into
other
banks
because
the
insurance
fund
had
a
limited
amount
of
money,
and
if
that
money
runs
out,
congress
either
has
to
appropriate
money,
which
it
has
very
rarely
done,
or
the
premiums
have
to
be
raised
on
the
insurances.
the
fund
is
primarily
funded
by
premiums
that
the
banks
pay.
the
banks
have
to
pay
more
premiums.
the
problem
that
you
have
of
losses
becomes
even
greater.
the
policy,
then,
was
to
try
to
keep
the
banks
alive.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
true,
for
a
while
they
were
reduced--
mr.
paul
bender
--but
the
danger
was
created,
and
it
happened
within
that
decade.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
problem
reappeared
before
firrea
was
passed,
because
if
one
bank,
if
one
s&l
absorbs
another,
which
has
happened
in
one
of
these
three
cases,
and
the
other
two
people
came
into
the
industry
who
hadn't
been
in
it
before,
and
took
over
a
failing
thrift,
they
then
often
take
great
risks.
those
risks
may
turn
out
not
to
be
profitable.
they
then...
the
larger
entity
may
then
fail,
and
that
was
what
was
happening
at
the
end
of
the
eighties.
mr.
paul
bender
don't
assume
that
just
because
one
bank
is
absorbed
by
another
that
deals
with
the
problem.
that's
a
way
of
putting
the
problem
off.
mr.
paul
bender
i
want
to
talk
about
the
contracts
in
these
three
cases,
but
i
think
the
right
context
to
talk
about
it
in
is
the
context
of
what
congress
did
and
why
they
did
it
in
firrea
and
whether
that
amounted
to
a
breach
of
any
promise
that
had
been
made.
what
congress
did
in
1989
to
deal
with...
to
try
to
deal
with
the
crisis,
they
did
a
number
of
different
things.
they,
for
example,
for
the
first
time
invested
an
enormous
amount
of
money
in
the
fund,
$100
billion
to
try
to
increase
public
confidence
and
make
the
money
available.
the
thing
they
did
that's
most
relevant,
or
directly
relevant
to
this
case,
is,
the
reason
banks
become
insolvent
is
because
they
lack
capital.
i
mean,
that's
almost
a
truism.
these
banks
that...
the
regulators
during
the
eighties
had
permitted
banks
to
continue
to
exist
with
zero
or
negative
capital
by
counting
things
like
the
goodwill
involved
in
this
case
as
capital.
it's
not
capital,
it's
a
fantasy.
it's
actually
a
loss
that's
on
the
books
of
the
bank
you
acquire,
but
they...
you're
right,
that
by...
the
strategy
was
to
not
close
the
banks,
and
in
order
to
do
that
they
permitted
them
to
count
as
capital
things
that
were
not
capital.
that
is
a
very
risky
situation,
because...
a
number
of
reasons.
the
people
who
own
those
banks,
if
they
have
no
capital
in
them,
having
nothing
to
lose
by
taking
risks.
they
lost
everything
they
have
already
because
they're
at
a
zero
stage.
they
are
encouraged
to
take
more
risks
to
make
a
profitable
situation.
by
taking
more
risks,
there
are
more
failures.
when
there
are
more
failures--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
they
were,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is,
when
congress
changed
the
policy
in
1989
to
require
real
capital
so
that
banks
would
not
be
operating
on
zero
or
negative
capital,
so
that
the
owners
of
the
banks
would
have
something
at
stake...
several
reasons
for
requiring
real
capital.
the
owners
have
something
at
stake.
they're
less
likely
to
take
risks.
there's
a
cushion
there,
also.
if
a
bank
has
$10
million
in
real
capital
it
can
absorb
$10
million
in
losses
before
becoming
insolvent.
if
it
doesn't
have
that,
it
can't
do
that.
congress
decided,
as
one
of
the
many
different
things
it
did
in
firrea
as
a
way
of
dealing
with
this
was
to
require
real
capital,
require
a
minimum
amount
of
real
capital
as
a
safety
feature.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
congress
had
changed
capital
standards
many
times
over
the
years.
mr.
paul
bender
you
mean...
by
the
impossibility
doctrine
you're
referring
to
the
sovereign
acts
doctrine?
mr.
paul
bender
but
where
the
government--
mr.
paul
bender
--it
might
very
well
happen.
i
think--
mr.
paul
bender
--we're
relying
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
promise
here--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
unmistakability
doctrine
is
a
doctrine
of
construction
of
a
contract,
and
that
doctrine...
we
don't
think
that
doctrine
needs
to
be
used
here
at
all.
if
you
just
read
the
contracts...
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
second...
there
is
no
promise
such
as
the
plaintiffs
say.
i
think...
let's
talk
about
what
the
plaintiffs
are
claiming.
the
plaintiffs
claim--
mr.
paul
bender
--right,
and
because
of
that,
these
contracts
should
be
read
and
are
only
sensibly
read
as
not
making
the
promise
that
the
plaintiffs
say
they
make,
namely
a
promise
that
that
wouldn't
change.
mr.
paul
bender
the
promise
that
they
allege
is
either
that
congress
would
not
toughen
capital
requirements
to
increase
the
required
solvency,
or
that
if
it
did,
these
banks
would
be
exempted
from
that,
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
a
promise
like
that.
mr.
paul
bender
without
any--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
it's
not.
no,
it's
not
implausible
at
all.
there
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
to
be
made
in
this
industry.
these
people
were
taking
a
risk.
take
winstar.
they
invested
$2
million
of
their
own
money.
in
return
for
that
$2
million
they
got
an
enormous
amount
of
assets
that
they
could
lend
out,
and
congress
had
loosened
the
restrictions
on
what
they
could
lend
it
to,
that
they
could
lend
out
on
risky
ventures.
they
were
risking
their
$2
million,
but
the
leveraging
that
they
were
getting
was
enormous.
they
could
have
made
enormous
profits.
glendale,
for
example,
turned
a
very
large
profit
during
that
time
by
doing...
by
taking
on
an
insolvent
institution,
because
glendale
got
an
institution
with
a
tremendous
number
of
assets
in
a
totally
new
market,
a
booming
market
where
they
hoped
they
could
lend
out
a
lot
of
money--
mr.
paul
bender
--right,
but
they...
the
assets
are
the
loans,
not
the
deposits.
the
deposits
are
the
liabilities.
mr.
paul
bender
if
the
contract
said
the
government--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
would
look
at
that
a
different
way.
if
it
is
so
vital
to
these
acquirers
that
they
be
guaranteed
that
they
can
continue
to
count
this
capital
even
though
congress
changes
the
rules
to
require
real
capital
rather
than
phony
capital,
if
it's
so
important
to
them,
you
would
think
that
they
would
get
a
promise
to
that
effect.
there
is
no
promise
here
anything
like
that.
mr.
paul
bender
right...
i
think
that's...
that
is--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it--
mr.
paul
bender
--for
the
future?
no,
it
didn't.
what--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
there's
no
bank
board
resolution
approving
counting
this
as
capital
for
the
future.
the
strongest
thing
in
statesman's
case--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
you
were
right
to
start
with
winstar.
winstar
has
a
forbearance
letter
that
they
rely
on.
there's
a
serious
problem
whether
a
forbearance
letter
should
be
deemed
to
be
a
promise
by
the
government
that...
because
the
letter
isn't
in
the
agreement.
winstar...
all
these
banks
signed
agreements.
these
provisions
aren't
in
those
agreements,
but
let's
look
at
the
letter
and
assume
it
is
a
promise.
what
does
it
say?
it
says,
for
purposes
of
reporting
to
the
board...
i'm
reading
from
the
joint
appendix
at
page
123.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
think
i'm
referring
to
the
same
document.
mr.
paul
bender
oh,
no,
i'm
not
referring
to
what
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
know,
you
were
talking
about
statesman.
no,
i
was
talking
about
winstar.
there
are
different
things
in
each
case.
mr.
paul
bender
let's
look
at
the
various
things.
mr.
paul
bender
you
want
to
start
with--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
let's...
and
let's
look
at
that
regulation.
mr.
paul
bender
i
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
that,
justice
scalia.
the
important
thing,
though,
is
to
look
at
the
regulation
or
document
or
promise
that
statesman
says
constitutes
a
promise
to
them
that,
even
if
congress
were
to
raise
capital
requirements,
make
them
stronger,
require
real
capital,
that
even
if
that
were
to
happen,
they
could
continue
to
count
this
nonreal
capital
for,
in
the
statesman's
case,
i
think
it
was
25
years.
that
just
doesn't
exist.
there
is
no
promise
like
that.
the
closest
they
have
is
with
regard
to
capital
credits,
which
are
a
different
form
of
goodwill,
and
that's
what
is
on
page
362a
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
and
several--
mr.
paul
bender
--probably
not.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it
applies
when
somebody
suggests
that
government
officials
have
made
a
promise
that
congress
will
or
will
not
regulate
for
the
public
interest
in
a
certain
way.
it
certainly
applies
when
somebody
says
that
government
officials
or
congress
have
made
a
promise
that
they
will
or
will
not
regulate
in
things
that
have
to
do
with
safe--
mr.
paul
bender
--or
that
if
they
did--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
there--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
there
are
two
kinds
of
promises
that
they
are
alleging,
that
they
could
allege
that
would
win.
one
is
that
congress
won't
do
it,
and
the
other
is
that
if
congress
did
it,
it
would
exempt
them
from
the
regulation,
and
no,
i
can't
think
of
a
promise
like
that,
and
it
doesn't
surprise
me.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
so,
justice
souter,
because
the
unmistakability
doctrine
is
a
doctrine
of
how
you
interpret
contracts.
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
did
the
government
make
a
promise
that
these
people
would
be
exempted
from
future
tightening
of
capital
requirements
in
the
s&l
industry?
mr.
paul
bender
that
would
have
to
be
unmistakable--
mr.
paul
bender
--well,
i
don't
think
it
is
reasonably
read
to
shift
a
risk,
and
that's
what--
mr.
paul
bender
--and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
paul
bender
we
are
arguing
that
there
was
no
authority,
because
that
also
has
to
appear
unmistakably,
and
that
plainly
did
not
appear
here.
mr.
paul
bender
--and
that's
another
reason
why
you
don't
have
these--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
quite
clearly.
unmistakably--
mr.
paul
bender
--i
think
so,
yes,
because
it
would
be
committing
a
future
congress
to
paying--
mr.
paul
bender
--because
i
don't...
i
think
it
would
be...
it's
only
ultra
vires
if
there
is
no
clear
authority
doing
it.
i'm
not...
that
authority
could
be
given
to
government
officials.
it
was
not
given
in
this
case.
i'm
not
arguing
it
cannot
be
given,
but
i
think
you
would
be--
mr.
paul
bender
--let
me--
mr.
paul
bender
--it's
within
the
capacity
of
the
government
if
congress
permits
the
officials
to
make
that
kind
of
a
contract,
but
i
think
before--
mr.
paul
bender
--fslic.
mr.
paul
bender
at
which
time
are
you...
to
which
time
are
you--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
the
government
had
the
option
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
enter
into
a
joint
venture
with
these
people.
it
was
to
the
government's
benefit,
yes,
because
the
policy
at
that
time
was
to
delay
the
closings--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
now,
there's--
mr.
paul
bender
--the
promise
that
they
made--
mr.
paul
bender
--was
that
as
long
as
the
law
permits
this
to
be
treated
as
capital
for
satisfying
capitalization
requirements,
you
can
do
certain
things
with
it.
you
can
put
it
on
your
books,
and
the
most
important
thing
that
went
on,
coming
back
to
the
winstar
agreement,
for
example...
they
all
have
elements
of
this
in
them...
at
that
time,
this
capital,
under
existing
accounting
regulations,
would
have
had
to
be
amortized
over
the
period
that
was
the
same
as
the
average
life
of
the
deposits
that
the
banks
had.
and
even
though
mortgages
are
like,
30-year
mortgages
or
15-year
mortgages,
the
average
life
of
those
is
about
10
years,
so
under
the
accounting
principles
at
the
time,
this
goodwill
that
they
got
would
have
had
to
be
amortized
over
10
years,
which
would
mean
they'd
have
to
take
one-tenth
of
it
off
each
year.
the
winstar
forbearance
letter
said,
we
forbear
from
applying
that.
you
can
do
it
over
35
years,
a
much
longer
period
of
time,
much
more
to
the
benefit
of
them.
that
was
a
promise
that
was
made.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it
would
have
to
say...
i
would
agree
with
you
except
it
would
be
that
congress
could,
by
changing
the
requirements--
mr.
paul
bender
--of
capitalization,
yes,
place
you
in
insolvency,
and
they
were
taking
a
risk.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
don't
think
there's
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
mr.
paul
bender
no--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
it's
not--
mr.
paul
bender
--no.
i
think
if
the
definition
of
what
could
be
counted
as
capital
did
not
change,
there
is
a
promise
that
you
can
amortize
it
over
35
years
rather
than
over
10
years.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
because
at
that
time
congress
had
delegated
to
them
the
primary...
justice
scalia,
think
of
a
hypothetical
that's
i
think
a
lot
like
this.
suppose
that
hospitals
were
acting
in
unsafe
ways,
and
a
number
of
them
had
to
close
because
of
the
large
number
of
claims
upon
them.
the
hospital
regulatory
agency
decided
that
the
way
to
try
to
deal
with
that,
because
we
needed
the
hospitals,
was
to
have
other
hospitals
absorb
them
and
promise
to
maintain
certain
minimum
safety
regulations
as
a
condition
of
absorbing
them,
and
suppose
they
signed
contracts
like,
to
do
that.
say
it
was
a
condition
of
this
you're
going
to
have
to
have
this
many
nurses,
this
many
operating
rooms,
this
many
this
and
this
many
that.
after
that
happens,
hospitals
continue
to
have
real
safety
problems,
and
in
the
next
5
years
there
are
lots
of
suits
against
them,
lots
of
people
are
injured
or
die,
and
the
legislature
decides
to
increase
those
safety
requirements.
would
anybody
want
to
read
a
contract
that
said,
you
can
do
this
if
you
meet
these
minimum
safety
requirements?
mr.
paul
bender
i
wasn't
talking
about
the
insolvency
there.
i
was
talking
about
the
safety
problem.
there,
the
government
is
trying
to
deal
with
a
safety
problem.
here,
the
government--
mr.
paul
bender
--that
is
our
position,
although
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that,
because--
mr.
paul
bender
--insofar
as
what
they
seek
is
to
say...
when
you
say
reach
the
result,
you
mean
that
they
get...
that
they--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
i'm
sorry,
i
take
that
back.
if
all
you're
asking
about
is
the
remedy
that
they
could...
that
they
could,
for
example,
get
the--
mr.
paul
bender
--no,
they
wouldn't
have
been
powerless
to
include
a
provision
that
gives
them
the
relief
they
want.
if
the
relief
they
want,
for
example,
is
return
of
their
investment,
fslic
would
have
been
able
to
put
in
a
provision
saying
if
the
capital
rules
change
within
the
next
10
years,
you
can
get
your
invest...
you
can
wash
out
the
agreement
and
get
your
investment
back.
that's
not
what
the...
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
what's
involved
in
this
case
is
a
claim
that
the
contract
was
made
that
they
would
be
exempted
from
any
changes
in
the
capital
requirements,
and
they're
asking
not
just
to
get
that
money
back,
they're
asking
for
breach
of
contract
damages.
there
is
a
possibility
in
this
case,
and
they
have
made
these
claims...
they're
not
involved
in
this
proceeding.
this
is
just
the
breach
of
contract
part.
there
is
a
possibility
of
them
arguing
frustration
of
purpose.
if,
for
example,
justice
scalia,
the
next
day
they
will
close
down,
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
very
powerful
claim.
that--
mr.
paul
bender
--right.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
think
if
there
had
been
a
provision
in
the
contract
saying
what
the
law
would
probably
give
anyway...
that
is,
if
the
contract's
frustrated
you
can
get
your
investment
back...
that
would
not
have
been
ultra
vires.
that...
i
really
need
to
stress
that.
that
is
not
what
they're
arguing
here.
they
are
arguing
that
they
had
a
contract
that
they
should
be
excluded
from
the
changes
in
capital
regulations,
and
that
they
have
a
right
to
breach
of
contract
damages,
which
are
more
than
just
getting
their
money
back.
it
is
the
profit
that
they
would
have
made
in
the
future.
if
they
bring...
brought
a
suit
for
frustration
of
purpose,
either
on
the
theory
of
implied
frustration
in
the
contract
or
justice
kennedy's
example
of
an
explicit
frustration
of
purpose
provision,
which
i
think...
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke
before.
i
think
that
is
a
provision
that
could
have
been
included
in
these
contracts...
that's
a
different
case.
mr.
paul
bender
i
thought
justice
kennedy's
example
and
justice
souter's
example
were
more
than
that.
it
was
not
that,
i
won't
do
it.
it's
that,
one
of
the
parties
will
get
their
money
back,
which
is
what
the
frustration
of
purpose
doctrine
i
think
would
do
in
this
case,
or
the
provision
that
justice
kennedy
mentioned.
thank
you
very
much.
