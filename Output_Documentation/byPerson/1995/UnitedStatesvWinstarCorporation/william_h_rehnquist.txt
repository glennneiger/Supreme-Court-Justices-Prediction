chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
95-865,
the
united
states
v.
winstar
corporation.
mr.
bender.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
where
the
unmistakability
doctrine
comes
in,
that
people
are
not
entitled
to
deal
with
the
government
on
assumptions
of
their
own,
or
what
reasonable
people
might
say,
it
has
to
be
unmistakable,
not
just
what
a
reasonable
person
would--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bender.
mr.
hollingsworth,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
unmistakability
doctrine,
mr.
hollingsworth,
require
a
little
bit
different
focus
on
that?
i
mean,
as
i
understand
the
doctrine,
it
would
mean
that
even
though,
if
you
take
the
reasonable
man
theory
of
contracts,
this
is
what
reasonably...
that's
not
enough
in
this
case
to
hold
the
government
liable
for
damages.
you
have
to
show
something
more.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
does
the
unmistakability
doctrine
add
to
the
ordinary
law
of
contracts,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
rule
any
promise
by
implication?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
tell
us
where
it's
found
in
the
brief,
or
in
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
letter
from...
a
letter
from
glendale's
accountant
doesn't
really
sound
like
what
would
be
a
binding,
explicit
promise
on
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
a
very
strange
provision
in
agreement,
that
it's
not
contained
in
the
agreement
itself,
but
it's...
one
of
the
parties'
accountants
furnishes
a
memorial
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
an
architect
is
generally
a
neutral
party
as
between
the
parties.
here,
it's
one
of
the
parties'
accounts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
answer
justice
kennedy's
question.
he
asked
you
whether
there
was
a
signed
stipulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hollingsworth,
your
time
has
expired.
you
probably
can't
see
it
because
your
thing
is
over
the
red
light.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cooper,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
now
reading
from
page
23
of
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
except
clause
modify,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
there's
several
pieces
of
phrasing
that
go
before
it.
is
that
except
clause,
does
that
modify
the
entire
paragraph,
or
just
the
thing
that's
already
excepted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
are
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
saying,
mr.
cooper,
then,
that
the
unmistakability
doctrine
really
does...
is
not...
have
any
substantive
content,
that
entirely
apart
from
that
doctrine
you
simply
interpret
the
contract
and
decide
who
prevails?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
should
be
applied
to
everybody.
why
limit
it
just
to
government,
if
it
aids
in
determining
the
true
intent
of
the
parties?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
cooper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
