well,
that
was
the
policy
that
the
government
regulators
permitted--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
occur.
i
mean,
this...
they
were
following
government
policy
in
having
that
kind
of
capital--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
bender--
--and
this
was--
--no,
go
ahead.
and...
i
was
going
to
say,
and
this
event,
i
take
it
it
is
fair
to
say,
was
exactly
the
event
that
the
parties
assumed
might
happen
when
they
made
their
contracts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
bender,
are
you
relying
on
impossibility
or
unmistakability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
unmistakability
doctrine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
is
no
stipulation.
i
mean,
you
can't
cite
here
in
the
record
a
written
document--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
which
this
refers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
these
provisions
are
different
from
those
in
the
contract
and
agreement
of
glendale,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
also
ask
you,
do
you...
have
you
sought
any
other
relief
under
the
takings
clause,
or
have
you
sought
relief
by
way
of
rescission
of
the
agreement
or
anything?
