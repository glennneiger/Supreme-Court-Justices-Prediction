justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
whoever
induced
whom
by
doing
what
these
banks
did,
the
claims
on
the
insurance
fund
were
drastically
reduced.
they
were
eliminated
with
respect
to
every
one
of
these
failing
banks,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
were
reduced
until...
the
problem
in
effect
was
deferred
until
firrea
was
passed.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
one
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--one
of
those
risks
was
the
object
of
the
contracts
in
these
three
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
fact
defeat
the
government's
attempt
to
bring
this
case
essentially
under
the
impossibility
doctrine,
because
the
impossibility
doctrine,
if
i
understand
it,
assumes
that
the
parties
assume
that
the
event
that
did
happen
was
not
something
that
was
going
to
happen.
they
both
had
made
an
assumption
that
was
false,
whereas
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
each
party
had
made
the
very
assumption
that
turned
out
to
be
true.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
sovereign
acts
is
an
element
of
it,
yes--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
one...
i
mean,
i
think
sovereign
acts
makes
sense
within
the
concept
of
an
impossibility
defense,
and
i
think
the
impossibility
defense,
i
understand
it,
rests
upon
the
assumption
that
the
act
or
event
that
makes
it
impossible
to
perform,
and
hence
excuses
performance,
is
an
act
or
event
which
each
party
assumed
would
not
happen,
whereas
in
this
case,
each
party
assumed
that
it
might
very
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i...
just
before
you
leave
the...
my
question
is...
i
take
it
your
answer
is
yes,
we...
each
side
was
assuming
that
this
might
very
well
happen,
and
this
was
part
of
the
object
of
contracting.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
it
wasn't
necessarily
a
promise
that
that
wouldn't
change.
it
was
a
promise
about
what
would
happen
to
these
banks
if
it
did
change.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
but--
--isn't
there
a
third
possibility,
mr.
bender,
that
even
if
they
are
not
exempted
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
enforce
their
agreement
specifically
to
allow
them
to
act
contrary
to
the
regulation,
isn't
there
a
third
possibility,
and
that
is
that
the
risk
of
loss
if
that
happens
falls
on
the
government,
not
on
them,
and
that's
why
it
seems
to
me
important
that
we're
dealing
with
a
damages
action
here
rather
than
an
action
for
specific
performance.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
in
each
case,
the
question,
i
suppose,
is,
is
it
unmistakable
that
they
either:
a)
promised
that
congress
wouldn't
do
it?
of
course
not.
b)
that
if
congress
did
it,
they
would
be
specifically
exempt
from
the
application
of
the
regulation?
probably
not.
or
c),
that
if
congress
did
do
it,
the
risk
of
whatever
the
added
cost
would
be
would
have
to
be
borne
by
the
government
and
not
by
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
may
be
unmist...
i
mean,
what
might
be
necessary
to
show
unmistakability
in
case
one,
which
is
virtually
impossible,
or
two,
unlikely,
may,
in
fact,
be
quite
enough
in
case
three,
if
we're
talking
about
a
contract
which
is
reasonably
read
simply
to
shift
a
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
that
even
a
riskshifting
contract
was
ultra
vires?
not
a
contract
that
you
will
be
specifically
exempted
if
the
regulation
changes,
or
if
the
law
changes,
but
a
contract
that
says,
if
it
does,
the
risk
is
on
the
government,
not
on
you?
you're
saying
that
that
last
case
is...
would
be,
or
was,
or
would
have
been
ultra
vires?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it's
not
committing
a
future
congress.
it's
committing
the
government
to
bear
the
risk
if
a
future
congress
makes
a
change.
why
is
that
ultra
vires?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
it
given
in
the
capacity
of
the
government
working
through
its
insurance
arm,
in
effect,
to
make
agreements
that
preclude
the
government
from
having
to
cough
up
on
its
insurance
obligations?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that
not
within
the
capacity
of
the
government
as
an
insurer?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're...
are
you
saying
that
the...
that
when
the
insolvency
of
the
s&l's
came
along,
that
the
only
course
that
the
government
in
fact
could
follow
with...
that
the
only
course
that
the
insurance...
that
the...
i'm
trying
to
think
of
the
insurance
acronym
and
i
can't
do
it...
you
know
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
the
only
course
it
could
follow
was
simply
to
pay
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
prior...
at
the
moment
these
contracts
were
made,
are
you
saying
that
in
fact
the
government
had
only
one
option,
and
that
was
to
declare
the
banks
insolvent
and
pay
up
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
contract
as
you
are
reading
it
has
the
government
promising
virtually
nothing.
the
government
basically,
with
respect
to
capital
requirements,
the
government
is
simply
saying,
on
your
reading,
whatever
we
agree
to,
we
agree
to,
but
if
there's
a
change,
too
bad.
well,
of
course--
--you're
saying
that--
--i
suppose
it
promised
that
fslic
would
continue
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--respect--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
you're
saying
in
the
same
breadth
that
fslic
had
no
authority
in
any
effective
way
to
continue
to
do
that,
because
fslic
would
be
overruled
by
any
change
in
legislation,
and
if
it
was
so
overruled,
the
risk
of
that
overruling
never
shifted
from
the
three
banks
here
to
the
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
much
of
an
agreement.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
extent
of
the
government's
authority
to
make
that
contract
would
have
been,
as
it
were...
as
you
view
it
would
have
been
made
explicit
if
those
provisions
had
been
followed
by
a
further
sentence
saying,
the
government
may
nonetheless,
through
an
act
of
congress,
place
you
in
insolvency
at
any
moment
after
the
signing
of
this
agreement,
and
in
effect
you're
saying
that's
the
extent
of
their
contracting
authority
in
these
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
bender,
isn't
your
answer
predicated
on
the
fact
not
that
they
would
be
able
to
get
their
investment
back
by
suing
on
their
contract,
they
would
be
able
to
get
their
investment
back
on
the
theory
that
the
contract
was
a
nullity,
and
if
that's
the
answer...
i
don't
think
that's
the
answer...
i
don't
think
that's
the
point
of
justice
kennedy's
question,
because
you're
still...
you're
not
saying
that
they
would
have
authority
to
make
a
contract.
you're
saying
that
the
law
would
give
them
restitution
if
the
contract
turned
out
to
be
a
nullity.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
still
in
the
position
of
saying...
i
think
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
on
your
position
is,
it
would
have
been
ultra
vires
for
them
to
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
hollingsworth,
with
respect
to
31b,
which
you
point
out
is
set
out
starting
on
571,
is
that
otherwise
expressly
incorporated
into
the
contract,
or
is
it
refer...
or
is
its
only
reference
through
the
stipulation
paragraph
that
we've
been
talking
about?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
has...
in
any
case,
its
incorporation
has
to
come
through
paragraph
4
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
