mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
actually
mr.
degen.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
october
24,
1989,
federal
prosecutors
in
reno,
nevada
commenced
a
civil
forfeiture
action
against
some
five
and
a
half
million
dollars
in
real
and
personal
property
owned
by
petitioner
brian
degen
and
his
wife,
karen.
as
the
forfeiture
statutes
permit,
mr.
degen
filed
a
claim
for
the
property.
in
it,
he
denied
that
the
property
was
either
the
proceeds
or
instrumentalities
of
narcotics
violations.
he
also
asserted
a
range
of
legal
defenses,
including
that
the
forfeiture
action
was
time-barred
and
that
it
rested
on
an
ex
post
facto
application
of
the
forfeiture
laws.
on
the
government's
motion,
however,
the
district
court
struck
mr.
degen's
claim
for
the
property.
the
court
ruled
that
because
mr.
degen,
a
dual
swiss
and
american
citizen,
had
not
traveled
to
the
united
states
to
stand
trial
in
a
criminal
case
that
had
been
brought
against
him,
he
was
a
fugitive,
and
as
a
fugitive
from
the
criminal
case,
he
was
therefore
disentitled,
in
the
vernacular,
from
contesting
the
civil
forfeiture
of
his
property.
the
district
court
therefore
entered
a
judgment
against
mr.
degen
for
the
full
amount
of
the
government's
claim,
some
five
and
a
half
million
dollars
of
property,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
our
central
submission
this
morning
is
that
federal
courts
and
federal
judges
do
not
have
the
authority
to
do
this.
to
the
contrary,
this
extraordinary
application
of
the
fugitive
disentitlement
doctrine
cannot
be
squared
with
this
court's
disentitlement
cases,
it
cannot
be
squared
with
due
process,
and
it
cannot
be
squared,
most
importantly,
with
the
limitations
that
this
court
has
always
recognized
on
the
scope
of
the
inherent
powers
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
believe
it
would.
i
believe
that
congress
would
not
have
authority
to
pass
a
statute
that
has
done
what
the
federal
courts
in
this
case
have
done,
although,
justice
scalia,
if
i
might
add,
it
is
all
the
more
unlawful
when
done
by
federal
courts.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
the
reason
is
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry,
your--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i...
it's...
i
think
that
the
line
of
authority
that
supports
the
proposition
is
embodied,
for
example,
in
mcveigh
and
in
hovey
v.
elliott,
where
the
court,
in
deciding
that
a
court
lacked
the
power,
said
that
not
even
a
legislature
could
pass
such
a
statute,
and
therefore
it's
all
the
more
unconstitutional
for
federal
courts,
or
in
those
cases
state
courts,
to
exercise
that
kind
of
authority.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
he
lived
in
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
record
suggests,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
he
went
to
switzerland
sometime
in
early
1988.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
was
unsealed
in
october
1989.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
would
not.
our
position
would
be
that
even
if
he
were
a
fugitive
in
that
sense,
which
he's
not,
but
even
had
he
been,
our
position
would
be
exactly
the
same.
that
is
to
say
that
a
federal
court
in
the
civil
forfeiture
case
would
not
have
the
authority
to
exercise
the
dispositive
sanction
of
dismissal.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
it
would
be...
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
that
congress
could
pass
a
statute
that
says
that
the...
that
you
have
no
right
to
defend
the
forfeiture
of
property
if
you
have
become
a
fugitive
in
a
criminal
case.
but
again--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--a
general
appearance
in
the
forfeiture
action?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
and
the
question
would
again
be
the
power
of
congress--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
again...
my
general
answer
is
that
when
congress
does
something,
obviously
they
are
not
constrained
by
the
limitations
on
inherent
powers.
the
question
that
would
be
presented,
justice
kennedy,
in
that
situation
is
whether
the
application
of
that
sanction
through
the
legislative
process
satisfies
the
conditions
articulated
in
hammond
packing
on
whether
there's
a
sufficient
nexus
between
the
violation
and
the
sanction
that's
been
imposed,
and
it
might
be--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
we
are
certainly
not
suggesting,
justice
ginsburg,
that
he
has
some
special
advantage
by
being...
by
virtue
of
his
nonappearance,
and
so,
for
example,
if
there
were
an
appropriate
sanction
for
nonappearance
in
the
forfeiture
action,
i
suppose
that
if
that
sanction
otherwise
comported
with
the
two
standards
that
this
court
articulated
in
insurance
corporation
of
ireland,
i
suppose
he
could
be
appropriately
sanctioned,
and--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--exactly.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
exactly.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
the
only
point
of
departure
that
i
thought
i
tried
to
suggest
to
your
honor's
question
is...
insofar
as
the
predicate
is
that
if
he
didn't
show
up
for
a
deposition
he
would
be
automatically
subject
to
have
his
claim
dismissed,
i'm
not
altogether
sure
that
courts
can
dismiss
claims
whenever
there's
any
particular
violation
of
a
discovery
order.
the
question--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--exactly.
you
know,
the
question
would
be,
you
know,
whether
this
comports
with
the
due
process
restrictions
on
rule
37
as
this
court
has
articulated
them
in--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think...
i
think
that's
correct,
if
i
understand
the
question.
if,
for
example,
his
nonappearance
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
district
court
in
the
forfeiture
action
to
proceed,
for
example
by
rendering
it
impossible
to
have...
you
know,
to
enforce
the
judgment,
or
to
take
control
of
the
race,
if
you
will,
then,
you
know,
there's
nothing
that
should
separate
mr.
degen
from
any
other
litigant.
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--oh,
i
think
if
he
were
to
appear
in
response
to
such
an
order,
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
immediately
served
with
process
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
the...
it
would
raise
a
question
in
my
mind,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
securing
his
appearance,
as
a
way
of
sort
of
going
around
the
extradition
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
your
honor,
that...
i
think
the
answer
is
this.
if
we
were
faced
with
that
case,
which,
of
course,
we're
not...
he
was
not
sanctioned
for
that
reason.
he
was
sanctioned
for
the
quite
different
reason
that
he
didn't
come
and
make
an
appearance
in
his
criminal
case.
but
had
he
been
sanctioned
for
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
would
raise
two
questions,
one
about
the
formulation
of
the
rule,
and
one
about
the
formulation
of
the
sanction.
the
formulation
of
the
rule
would
be,
can
a
district
judge
say
that
in
all
civil
forfeiture
actions
every
claimant
must
show
up
in
person?
i
think
that
would
raise
a
question,
which
i'm
not
prepared
to
sort
of
give
a
complete
answer
to,
but
i
think
it
would
raise
a
question
as
to
whether
a
district
court
would
be
in
effect
announcing
that
the
rules
provided
by
congress,
including
for
foreign
depositions
and
telephonic
depositions,
shall
be
just
set
aside,
and
that
no
discretion
shall
be
exercised.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
that
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i...
well,
again,
i
think
the
interest
of
the
state
is
greater,
but
the
question
that
i
was
intending
to
answer
is
whether
a
court
could
say
that
notwithstanding
rules
28(b)
on
foreign
depositions
and
rule
30(b)(7)
on
telephonic
depositions,
i'm
just
not...
the
judge
would
be
saying
in
all
civil
forfeiture
actions
i'm
not
going
to
consider
those--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
it
is
possible
that
if
circumstances
warranted
that
and
the
judge,
you
know,
gave
reasons
that
satisfy
a
reviewing
court
that
this
was
an
appropriate
exercise
of
discretion
that
might
be
done,
but
then
the
further
question,
if
i
might,
as
to
whether
the
violation
of
that
order
gives...
justifies
the
sanction,
the
dispositive
sanction
of
dismissal--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no.
[laughter]
and
the
question,
of
course,
has
not
been
presented,
since
he's
obeyed
every
order
in
the
civil
case
that's
been
pressed
on
him,
and
this
district
judge,
unlike
the
hypothetical
district
judge
that
the
question
presupposes,
has
ordered
foreign
depositions
in
the
case
of
karen
degen,
my
client's
wife.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
since--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--since
you're...
and
actually,
it's
more
than
that,
justice
breyer.
since
you're
not
here
in
this
other
case--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no
question.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes,
but
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
draw
exactly
the
line
that
this
court
has
drawn
in
that
exact...
in
those
very
cases.
the
line...
and
it
cuts
across
several
factors
that
distinguish
the
facts
of
this
case
from
that
line
of
cases.
in
the
first
place,
justice
breyer,
those
are
cases
in
which
there
is
no
underlying
constitutional
right
that's
been
abrogated.
there's
no--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
believe
that
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
that's
exactly
what--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
again,
these
are
cases
in
which
the
sanction
is
being
imposed
in
the
very
proceeding
in
which
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
one
distinction
is
that
it
doesn't
turn
so
much
on
the
forfeiture
of
property
as
it
does
on
the
fact
that
there
are
two
different
proceedings,
and
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding
there
is
no
showing
that
the
fugitivity
has
any
impact,
has
had
any
impact
on
the
process
of
the
forfeiture
court,
which
is,
of
course,
exactly
the
distinction
that
persuaded
this
court
in
ortega-rodriguez
to
draw
the
line
where
it
did.
we're
insisting
on
exactly
the
same
line
and,
indeed,
the
use
of
the
disentitlement
doctrine
in
this
setting
in
my
view
is
vastly
more
dramatic.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i've
heard
such
an
argument
may
be
made.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
contend
that
they
are
separate
proceedings,
of
course.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
treat
them
as
separate
proceedings
and,
indeed,
they
are
separate
proceedings,
but
even--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--exactly,
and
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--and
the
inquiry
would...
and
the
inquiry
would
still
be,
has
the
fugitivity
in
case
one
affected
the
proceedings
in
case
two,
and
my
general
answer
is
that
if
the
answer
is
no,
it
doesn't
meet
ortega-rodriguez,
it
is
nothing
like
any
disentitlement
case
this
court
has
ever
approved,
it
serves
none
of
the
purposes...
none
of
the
purposes...
that
this
court
identified
in
ortega-rodriguez.
what
the
government
wants
in
order
to
sustain
this
forfeiture
is
for
the
court
to
completely
reformulate
the
doctrine
of
fugitive
disentitlement
so
that
it
no
longer
matters
whether
the
claimant
has
a
dispositive
motion
that
doesn't
even
require
his
presence,
or
even
his
testimony,
so
that
it
doesn't
even
matter
if
the
government
has
probable
cause,
so
that
it
doesn't
even
matter
whether
there's
venue
in
this
court,
so
that
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
that
he
hasn't
shown
up
to
face
parallel
criminal
charges.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i'm
actually
not
certain
whether
mr.
degen
could
have
entered
a
limited
appearance.
in
this
particular
case,
he
hired
a
lawyer
to
contest
the
forfeiture--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--correct,
which
is,
of
course,
the
only
thing
that
can
be
subject
to
the
forfeiture
judgment.
the
forfeiture
court
has
not
seized
jurisdiction
over
mr.
degen
for
purposes
of
imposing,
you
know,
a
dispositive
sanction
on
him
other
than
in
the
course
of
the
litigation
were
he
to
violate
a
court
order.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
exactly,
and
actually
this
is
actually
to
me
a
more
dramatic
example
of
that
for
the
following
reason.
mr.
degen
has
been
sanctioned,
indeed
dispositively
sanctioned,
not
because
of
something
he
did
in
the
criminal
case,
but
for
his
failure
to
come
to
the
united
states,
an
act
over
which
the
court
in
the
criminal
case
lacks
jurisdiction.
in
a
sense,
this
is
the
use
of
an
inherent
power
to
sanction
someone
in
case
one
because
of
something
that
he
failed
to
do
outside
the
courtroom
in
case
two,
and
i'd
like
to
suggest,
with
all
due
respect,
that
there
is
no
authority
certainly
in
any
of
this
court's
cases
for
this
kind
of
a
use
of
an
inherent
power
of
a
court.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
the
answer,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
there...
is
that
it's
possible
the
court
could
do
that,
saying,
look,
i
didn't
get
to
test
his
demeanor--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
it
is
permissible,
and
after
all,
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
mr.
degen
bears
the
burden
of
proof.
his
not
showing
up
has
consequences
for
him,
too.
just
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
societe
internationale,
there
are
consequences
for
the
litigant
that
doesn't
appear,
but
one
of
them
is
not
that
you
dispositively
sanction
him,
take
his
property,
give
him
no
day
in
court,
for
the
reason
that
in
a
separate
case
over
which
the
judge
has
no
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place,
he
hasn't
shown
up.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
don't
think
so,
any
more
than
the
court
was
inclined
to
consider
the
two
stages
of
ortega-rodriguez
the
same
case.
there,
after
all,
you
had
a
prosecution
followed
by
an
appeal,
and
yet
the
court
concluded
that
because
there
was
no
impact
on
the
appellate
proceedings
of
the
same
exact
case,
you
couldn't
apply
the
disentitlement
doctrine
in
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
it
is
the
same
court,
but
it's
the
same
court
with
respect
to
a
different
case,
and
the
inquiry,
i
thought,
in
ortega-rodriguez
is
whether
the
appellate
process...
that
was
certainly
one
of
the
factors.
has
the
appellate
process
been
disturbed,
or...
and--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
understand,
but
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
understand,
but
i
think
it
remains
the
case
that
federal
courts...
even
if
it
happens
to
be
the
same
judge,
i
do
not
understand
any
of
this
court's
cases
to
permit
the
sanctioning
of
a
litigant
who
happens
to
be
before
the
same
judge
in
another
case,
even
if
it's
related
cases.
they
have
some
facts
in
common.
nevertheless,
i
understand
no
authority,
and
i'm
aware
of
no
authority,
the
government
cites
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
judge,
no
matter
how
similar
the
underlying
cause
of
action
may
be,
that
a
sanction
can
be
imposed
in
case
one
because
of
case
two,
particularly,
let
me
add,
for
conduct
that
is
not
unlawful
in
any
way.
it
bears
mention
that
although
mr.
degen's
failure
to
come
to
the
united
states
is
doubtless
frustrating
to
the
united
states
attorney
in
reno,
nevada,
to
the
department
of
justice,
and
to
judge
reed
sitting
in
reno,
nevada,
neither
of
the
political
branches,
neither
congress
nor
the
executive
branch,
have
chosen
to
proscribe
it
in
any
way.
it
doesn't...
it
isn't
extraditable.
it
isn't
punishable.
it's
not
against
the
law.
it
violates
no
positive
law,
and
yet
there
is
a
district
judge
in
reno,
nevada
who,
following
circuit
court
precedent,
and
i
must
say,
precedent
in
various
other
circuits
as
well,
has
dispositively
sanctioned
someone,
taken
all
his
property
without
giving
him
his
day
in
court.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that
strikes
me
as
quite
extraordinary.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i...
oh,
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think
if
there
were
questions
of
concealment
and
harboring,
if
that
were
true,
there
might
be
criminal
sanctions
attached
to
the
persons
doing
it,
but
justice
kennedy,
it
must
be
said
mr.
degen
is
so
far
from
being
harbored
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
the
united
states
government
to
prevail
upon
the
swiss
to
arrest
him
and
toss
him
in
jail,
where
he
lingered
for
nearly
2
years.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
he
is
on--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
am--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--the
status
is
that
he
is
out
on
bail.
i
have
no
reason
to
challenge
the
proposition
that
he
could
come
here
without
penalty
from
the
swiss,
but
i
don't
know
that
to
be
the
case,
but
i'm
not
asserting
the
opposite,
either,
and
my
argument
wouldn't--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
he's
not.
he's
still
awaiting
trial
on
charges
that,
on
their
face,
embody
the
allegations
of
the
american
indictment
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
the
swiss
arrest
came
in,
i
believe,
november
of
1992.
he
had
already
been
disentitled
at
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
it
had
not
yet
occurred.
with
the
court's
permission,
if
there
are
no
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
is
a
very
good
illustration
for
why
what
this
court
called
the
blunderbuss
of
dismissal
is
inappropriate
as
way
of
solving
the
problem
that
the
government
is
concerned
about.
if
disentitlement
is
to
be
taken
at
the
threshold
in
order
to
protect
against
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
discovery
in
the
civil
case
that
provides
a
window
into
the
criminal
case,
district
courts
can
do
that,
and
they
do
it
of
every
day
of
every
week
by
applying
rule
26(c)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
issue
protective
orders.
this
case,
however,
is
different,
because
in
this
case
the
federal
prosecutor
said
to
the
district
judge
in
an
argument,
made
and
reproduced
on
page
6a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
that
there
was
no
need
to
stay
the
forfeiture
proceedings
one
minute
longer
in
deference
to
the
criminal
case
precisely
because
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag
in
the
criminal
case.
there
was
no
need
to
protect
against
the
disclosure
of
witnesses,
no
need
to
protect
against
the
disclosure
of
any
evidence,
and
in
response
to
the
prosecutor's
argument,
the
district
court
said,
fine,
you
can
go
ahead
and
take
all
the
depositions
you
want...
karen
degen,
the
petitioner's
wife,
and
in
an
order
that's
reflected
in
the
minutes
of
the
february
1,
1993
transcript.
in
short,
this
district
judge
concluded
that
no
protective
order
was
appropriate
precisely
because
there
was
nothing
to
protect
against.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
she
is
not.
she
is
living
with
her
husband
and
their
children
in
switzerland.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
discovery
was
issued
in
her
favor,
but
not
in
mr.
degen's
favor,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
point
here
is
the
wonderful
irony
about
this
argument
is
it
bears
no...
you
know,
no
coherent
relationship
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
precisely
to
avoid
a
problem
that
the
prosecutor
said
was
not
presented,
mr.
degen
is
to
be
disentitled,
dispositively
sanctioned
for
conduct
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
even
in
the
action
in
which
he
is
a
putative
fugitive,
to
sanction
him
for.
let
me
also
get
rid
of
one
other
red
herring.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
he'd
already
been
disentitled,
so
what
they
were
saying
is,
you
know,
don't
pay
any
attention
to
the
need
to
get
his
evidence
because
you've
already
knocked
him
out
of
the
box,
and
to
the
extent
that
karen
is
relying
on
his
unavailability
as
a
reason
to
extend
the
summary
judgment
proceedings,
you
shouldn't
credit
his...
the
need
for
his
testimony.
the
other
red
herring
i'd
like
to
deal
with
is
the
argument
that
the
government
has
already
established
its
right
to
this
money.
what
it
has
established
is
its
right
to
the
seizure
of
this
money
and
this
property
through
a
prima
facie
showing,
to
be
sure,
but
if
i
can
be
indulged
one
other
latinism,
it's
also
completely
ex
parte.
they
went
into
court
with
a
complaint
and
an
affidavit
that,
you
know,
to
my
mind
barely
shows
probable
cause
to
believe
any
of
the
property
was
in
fact
used
in
violation
of
881(a)(6)
and
(a)(7),
and
now
they
have
the
money,
and
now,
as
the
law
permits,
it's
our
burden
to
come
into
court
and
overcome
that
prima
facie
showing.
it's
our
day
in
court,
the
first
and
only
one
we
get.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
that's
correct.
they've
gone
in
and
shown
that
they
have
at
least
that
much
of
a
claim,
but
the
law
then
permits
mr.
degen
to
come
in
and
overcome
it,
and
you
know,
if
his
unavailability
prejudices
his
capacity
to
make
that
showing,
then
he's
so
much
the
worse
for
it.
we're
not
asking
that
he
be
treated
any
better.
we're
asking
that
he
be
given
the
rights
and
opportunities
that
the
law
prescribes,
and
he's
being...
you
know,
he's
been
foreclosed
those
opportunities
by
virtue
of
conduct
that
is
not
against
the
law,
period,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
courts
can't
do
it
and
we--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--it
is
not
criminal.
i
mean--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
your
honor
adverted
to
whether
there
isn't
some
other
law
inherent
in
the
duty
of
citizenship.
it
may
be,
although
blackmer
does
not
deal
with
that
issue,
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
but
rather
a
quite
different
issue.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you.
