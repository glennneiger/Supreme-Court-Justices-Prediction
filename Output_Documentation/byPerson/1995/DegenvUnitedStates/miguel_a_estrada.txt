mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
undisputed
that
this
civil
forfeiture
action
is
directly
related
to
a
criminal
case
that
is
pending
in
the
same
district
courthouse
against
degen,
and
that
degen
refused
to
appear
to
stand
trial
on
the
criminal
charges.
for
two
reasons,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
a
claimant
in
degen's
situation
may
be
disentitled
from
contesting
the
civil
forfeiture
action.
first
and
foremost
a
civil
claimant's
participation
in
the
civil
forfeiture
action
fundamentally
threatens
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
case.
second,
the
claimant's--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is,
in
fact,
our
principal
argument
here.
our
argument
starts
from
the
premise
that
courts
always
have
had
the
inherent
authority
to
protect
against
the
abuse
of
their
processes
by
a
litigant,
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
rule
at
issue
here
does.
if
a
civil
claimant
is
allowed
to
participate
in
a
civil
forfeiture
action
while
at
the
same
time
he
refuses
to
stand
trial
on
a
criminal
case
that
is
based
on
the
identical
event,
he
may
then
use
the
very
broad
civil
discovery
rules
that...
to
circumvent
the
very
well
settled
and
strict
restrictions
on
criminal
discovery.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
not
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect,
and
in
order
to
understand
why,
it
is
useful
to
note
why
it
is
that
we
have
limited
criminal
discovery
in
our
society.
those
rules
limiting
strictly
criminal
discovery
exist
because
long
experience
has
taught
congress
and
the
courts
that
early
disclosure
of
the
government's
case
in
a
criminal
prosecution
often
leads
to
contrived
defense
testimony--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
not
so,
mr.
justice
stevens,
for
the
following
reason.
congress
has
recognized
precisely
the
danger
that
we're
pointing
to
in
this
case,
and
in
section
20...
and
section
881(i)
of
title
21
has
given
the
government
the
right
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
get
a
stay
of
the
civil
forfeiture
action
pending
the
conclusion
of
the
criminal
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
take
it
that
if
we
had
done
that
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
net...
the
result
would
have
been
that
we
couldn't
get
any
judgment
in
the
civil
forfeiture
action
because
the
criminal
case
can't
start
while
mr.
degen
is
in
switzerland.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
no.
we
want
our
statutory
rights
under
the
forfeiture
statute--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--which
is
to
get
the
money
without
having
to
compromise
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
process,
and
since
we
are
not
at
fault
for
the
fact
that
he's
in
switzerland,
we
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
court's
authority
to
have
a
very
simple
procedural
rule
in
the
civil
case
that
says
that
if
you
want
to
file
a
claim
in
the
civil
case
you
should
come
and
face
the
related
criminal
charges.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
for
as
long
as
he
lives,
mr....
justice
o'connor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the
government
has
lost
its
right
to
the
property.
under
the
forfeiture
laws
we
have
made
a
prima
facie
showing
which
on
its
face
entitles
us
to
the
property
outright.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
there
are
two
points
in
answer
to
that
question,
justice
scalia.
congress
has
not
addressed
the
problem
that
we
are
faced
with
here.
it
has
not
dealt
with
how
to
deal
with
someone
who
is
a
fugitive
in
a
foreign
country,
so
that
there's
no
negative
implication
that
that
is
an
exclusive
remedy.
the
second
point,
which
i
think
is
more
important,
is
that
the
fact
that
congress
has
dealt
with
an
aspect
of
the
issues
that
come
up
with
cases
when
cases
are
related
does
not
mean
that
the
court
ceases
to
have
a
very
strong
interest
in
keeping
parties
from
abusing
its
processes,
and
that's
what
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
yes,
there
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
have...
at
page
18a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix
there
is
a
finding
by
the
district
judge
that
he
is
a
fugitive,
and
at
page
5a--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
it's
page
18a,
and
it
is
the
last
full
paragraph.
it
says,
the
ninth
circuit
has
given
us
the
following
definition
of
who
is
a
fugitive,
and
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
in
this
case
brian
knows
he
is
wanted
by
the
police
but
refuses
to
submit
to
arrest,
even
though
he
professes
his
innocence.
thus,
we
conclude
that
brian
degen
is
a
fugitive.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
right,
in
that
sense
of
the
word,
and
that
is
the
sense
of
the
word
that
is
relevant
to
the
application
of
the
sanction
at
issue
here.
i
think
it
bears
emphasis
from
our
point
of
view
that
we
are
not
here
supporting
the
notion
that
the
sanction
being
imposed
is
an
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
court
in
the
criminal
case.
we
are
not
saying,
for
example,
that
he
has
a
legal
duty
that
is
enforceable
in
the
criminal
case
if
the
case
were
standing
alone.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is
a
proper
use
of
the
court's
authority
to
manage
the
civil
case
to
guard
against
the
possibility
that
he
will
use
the
processes
in
the
civil
case
to
undermine
public
policies
that
have
been
reflected--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--in
the
discovery
rule.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
there
are
two
different
points
being
raised
by
your
question,
as
i
understand
it,
justice
ginsburg.
one
is
why
can't
we
wait,
and
the
other
one
is,
we
have
control
over
the
property,
so
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
enforceability
of
the
judgment.
let
me
take
the
first
one
first,
which
is
that...
and
in
answering
that
one,
it
is
important
to
recognizes
that
we
are
claiming
two
distinct
interests
in
the
civil
forfeiture
action
for
supporting
this
rule.
one,
of
course,
is
the
fact
that
he
has
shown
to
the
court
that
he
intends
to
play
games
with
the
court
and
maybe
their
answer
is
let's
wait
and
see
if
he
does
it
some
more,
but
even...
even
accepting
that
that
would
be
an
acceptable
answer,
it
is
not
an
acceptable
answer
to
the
more
fundamental
problem
that
we
are
identifying,
which
is
that
by
getting
discovery
and
allowing...
and
being
allowed
to
litigate
the
civil
forfeiture
action,
he
is
circumventing
the
criminal
discovery
rules.
those
rules
reflect
a
very
strong
public
policy
that
cannot
be
dealt
with
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
mean,
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that
question.
the
first
one
is
that
i
think
that
it
is
not
right
because
it
is
possible
that
he
could
say
that
all
he
intends
to
do
in
the
action
is
to
call
the
following
six
witnesses
who
will
testify
that
in
fact
all
property
came
from
an
inheritance
or
from
some
other
source
of
income,
and
we
may
well
know
that
that
is
not
true
because
all
of
our
evidence
in
the
criminal
case
shows
where
the
property
comes
from.
so
all
that
is
doing
is
pushing
the
problem
one
step
further,
because
he
will
then
put
us
to
the
choice
either
of
compromising
the
criminal
case
or--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
i
am
not
saying
that.
what
i
am
saying
is
there
are
enough
circumstances
in
the
class
of
cases
to
warrant
the
adoption
of
a
general
rule
while
recognizing
that
the
rule
can
have
exceptions
for
specific
cases
being,
in
its
nature,
discretionary.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
we
have
a
legal
right
to
it.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
it
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
under
the
act
of
congress
that
we
have
at
issue
here,
we
have
a
right
to
the
money,
and
that
there
is
no
foreseeable
time
in
the
future
at
which
the
two
proceedings
can
be
dealt
with
in
an
orderly
fashion.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
what
we
would
say
is
that
courts
would
have
authority
to
frame
the
rules
that
would
keep
the
public
interest
from
being
harmed
as
a
result
of
an
early--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that's
right,
and
this
is
such
a
rule,
and
that's
our
point.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the
rule
was
used
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
justice
breyer,
is
the
rule
saying
if
you
want
to
defend
the
civil
forfeiture
action,
you
have
first
to
face
the
criminal
charges,
and
the
district
court
was
quite
clear...
and,
in
fact,
i
could
point
the
court
to
the
top
of
page
26a
of
the
pet
app.--
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
would
be
free
to
defend
the
civil
forfeiture
action
to
his
heart's
content
if
he
would
only
appear
in
the
criminal
case,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
that
is
true
both
in
the
criminal
case
and
in
the
civil
case,
and
i
think
it
leads
me
to
a
further
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
in
response
to
justice
souter,
which
is
that
we
can
readily
concede
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
there
is
no
legally
enforceable
duty
to
show
up
in
the
criminal
case
that
flows
from
the
criminal
case
itself.
that
does
not
mean
that
his
failure
to
show
up
in
the
criminal
case
has
a
positive
value
to
our
society
that
we
should
strive
to
accommodate
in
framing
rules
for
the
orderly
conduct
of
the
civil
litigation.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that
is
not
so,
because
we
have
a
duly
returned
indictment,
and
we
have
a--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
i
said
that
it
is
not
significant
for
our
case
in
this
case
to
show
that
he
has
a
legal
duty
that
flows
from
the
criminal
case,
but
what
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
court
in
the
orderly
process
of
the
civil
case
may
have
a
rule
to
protect
the
civil
case
processes
from
being
misused
in
the
criminal
case,
and
it
is
equally
true,
for
example,
that
there
is
no
legal
duty
to...
let's
say,
for
example--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--but
he
doesn't--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--but
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
buy
his
way
out
of
a
criminal
indictment
either,
and
he
has
no
right--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
the
difference
is,
justice
stevens,
that
we're
entitled
to
the
expectation
that
if
we
ever
get
our
hands
on
him
we're
going
to
put
him
in
a
u.s.
jail,
where
we
think
he
belongs,
and
under
your
view
of
the
facts
what
would
really
happen
is
that
we
would
be
entitled,
as
of
now,
to
say
$5
million
only
if
we're
ready
to
give
up
for
good
the
hope
of
ever
bringing
someone
to
justice
who
spent
the
better
life
of
his--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--right,
and
that
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
not
a
tactical
advantage,
and
i
understand
that
it
is
possible
to
have
different
views
on
the
value
of
criminal
discovery,
justice
stevens,
but--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--and
we
did
that.
i'm
not
saying
that
we
are
not
required
to
make
the
prima
facie
showing
that
the
statute
requires
us
to
make.
all
we
ask--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
we're
not.
we're
not,
and
we're
also
saying--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--because
we
can
make
a
prima
facie
showing
by
a
verified
complaint
in
an
affidavit
that
shows
probable
cause,
which
under
the
forfeiture
laws
then
shifts
to
him
the
burden
of
proving
a
lawful
source
for
the
funds,
but
it
is
not
our
view
that
we
can
come
into
the
court
without
making
a
prima
facie
showing
under
the
forfeiture
laws
and
get
a
judgment.
all
we're
asking
for--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well...
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
because,
as
i
think
i
indicated
earlier,
that
only
pushes
the
problem
one
further
step.
he
will
then
come
in
and
put
whatever
evidence
he
thinks
he
has,
and
in
effect
put
us
to
the
choice
of
disclosing
our
case
to
meet
his
evidence,
or
giving
up
on
the
forfeiture
case,
and
as
i
was
going
to--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
are
happy...
well,
yes
and
no.
we're
happy
for
him
to
know
as
much
as
he
wants
so
long
as
he
knows
it
at
a
time
when
he
no
longer
has
the
possibility
of
affecting--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--the
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
entirely
fair
recharacterization
of
what
i
said.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
we're
happy
to
make
a
prima
facie
showing,
and
we're
happy
to
have
a
full-blown
trial,
if
we
are
sure
that
we
will
not
be
endangering
the
criminal
prosecution.
it
is
not
that
we--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
but
what
i
also
mean
is
that
the
reason
for
the
rules
on
criminal
discovery
is
that
what
often
happens
when
we
have
it
is
that
we
have
obstruction
of
justice
and
witness
intimidation
and
contrived
testimony,
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
rules
being
as
strict
as
they
are,
and
they
do
reflect
a
public
policy,
is
that
the
danger
of
that
happening
cannot
effectively
be
controlled
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
i
mean,
we
cannot
take
a
wait-and-see
attitude
to
see
whether
someone
will
attempt
obstruction
of
justice
because
often
the
first
indication
that
we
will
see
is
the
contrived
defense
at
trial
followed
immediately
by
an
unwarranted
acquittal.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
it
is
in
the
sense,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
district
court
retains
discretion
in
every
case.
they
also
retain
the
extent
of
the
dangers.
i--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--in
an
ordinary
case?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
in
an
ordinary
case,
that
would
probably
be
true,
especially
with
charges...
with
criminal
charges
of
the
nature
that
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
think
that
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
we
do
say
that
the
interest
of
the
court
in
the
civil
case
to
guard
against
the
misuse
of
its
processes
are
strong
enough
to
warrant
a
rule
telling
somebody
that
he
should
come
meet
criminal
charges.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
in
absentia,
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
unfortunately,
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
in
respect...
as
that
justification
goes,
that
is
true.
i
will
point
out,
as
we
did
in
our
brief,
that
he
is,
in
fact,
an
american
citizen
both
by
birth
and
by
breeding,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
correct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
was
not
sent
to
him
to
be
a
witness
in
the
criminal
case,
and
i
think
that
the
relevance
of
the
blackmer
case
here
is
that
it
shows
that
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
has
the
right
to
have
a
rule
that
calls
them
back
to
this
country
to
respond
to
court
process.
there's--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
i
think
it
is
a...
yes,
but
i
think
we
think
of
it--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--as
a
civic
duty.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
right.
it's
like
piling
on...
there's
no
point.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
mean,
there's
no
point.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--do
i
say
that?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
subject
to
the
qualification
that
i
think
flows
from
some
of
these
courts'
due
process
cases
that
he
be
shown
to
have
had
notice
and
that
it
was
possible
in
fact
for
him
to
come.
i
mean,
it
may
be
that
he
is...
that
we
don't
know
where
he
is
and
we
can't
effectively
give
him
notice,
nor
we
may
know
whether;
in
fact,
it
is
possible
for
him
to
comply,
but
subject
to
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
on
what,
justice
breyer?
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
i
don't
think
so.
from
our
point
of
view
the
case
really
does
involve
the
very
narrow
question
of
the
power
of
the
civil
court
to
make
sure
that
someone
will
not
misuse
it
to
gain
an
unfair
tactical
advantage.
and
it
is,
as
the
district
court
framed
it,
a
limited
rule,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
a
rule
that
allows
for
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
specific
cases,
this
not
being
one
of
them,
because
mr.
degen
waived
any
right
to
discretionary
claims
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
it
is
not
in
any
sense
the
type
of
extreme
rule
that
mr.
robbins
has
indicated
we
have.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
based
on
a
crime
in
the
indictment
such
that
the
same
concern
about
the
early
disclosure
of
the
government's
case
would
apply,
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that's
right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
not...
it
is--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--if
there
is
a
prima
face
case,
and
he
wishes
to
dispute
the
case,
there's
a
reasonable
procedural
rule
to
say
we
have
such
a
strong
interest
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
related
case
that
we
will
require
you
to
come
face
the
music
in
that
case
as
a
condition
to
maintaining
your
civil
action,
which
is
no
different
from
having
filing
fees
or
timing
requirements
on
when
you
file
your
brief,
although
which
are
predicated
on
the
notion
that
these
are
simple
rules
with
which
a
litigant
can
comply
and
that
serve
usefully
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
court
in
the
civil
case
to
conduct
orderly,
fair,
and
expeditious
litigation.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
under
the
view
of
the
other
side,
we
can't
get
the
funds
into
the
u.s.
treasury
where
we
think
they
belong.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
to
wait...
what,
justice
ginsburg?
i
mean,
there
is
no
reasonable
indication
that
he
will
ever
come
to
this
country
to
face
the
criminal
charges,
so
what
we're
saying
is
that
we're
going
to
put
the
money
in
a
bank
where
the
government
has
no
access
to
it,
even
though
it
has
made
a
showing--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
but
we're
entitled
to
it
now,
and--
[laughter]
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
understand
the
point
of
your
question,
and
i
would
say
that
i
suppose
that
is
a
form
of
a
compromise
that
has
as
much
grounding
in
the
court's
inherent
authority
as
the
more
easily
manageable
rule
that
we
have
here,
and
since
we
are
not
the
people
at
fault,
and
since
by
statute
we
are
also
entitled
to
the
principal,
it
seems
to
me
that
as
between
the
choice
of
two
reasonable
rules
that
accomplish
a
purpose,
we're
entitled
to
that
one
that
gives
us
our
statutory
rights.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
have
proven
our
entitlement
to
the
money--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--and
all
we're
looking
to
see
is
that
in
disputing
our
showing
the
other
party
doesn't
put
us
to
the
choice
of
giving
up
our
statutory
entitlement
or
giving
up
the
very
strong
public
interest
in
the
integrity
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
