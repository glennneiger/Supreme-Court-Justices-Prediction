justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
so
even
if
you
make
a
general
appearance
in
the
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
the
powers
of
congress
under
the
due
process
clause.
assume
that
there's
a
general
appearance
in
the
action
but
a
refusal
to
make
discovery
or
a
refusal
to
appear
because
you're
a
fugitive
from
justice.
couldn't
the
congress
of
the
united
states
say,
in
that
case
we
can
take
judgment
against
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
judge
decline
to
give
the
usual
weight
and
credit
to
the
sworn
affidavit
because
of
the
defendant's
absence?
he'd
say,
i
have
this
paper
in
front
of
me,
but
number
1,
this
man's
a
fugitive.
i'm
going
to
discount
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
only
possible,
is
it
permissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
could--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
those
who
are
assisting
him
in
remaining
abroad,
couldn't
they
be
liable
for
harboring
a
fugitive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
forget
the
extraterritoriality
aspect
of
it
so
far
as
the
forum.
suppose
he
was
in
new
york
state,
and
he
was
being
hidden
out--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
doesn't
sound
like
it's
a
rule
of
the
trial
court's
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
from
all
you
have
said,
i
presume
that
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
trial
judge
not
to
entertain
your
motion--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
disentitle
him
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
have
that
rule,
i
suppose
we're
telling
all
other
countries
in,
at
least
countries
with
an
open
judicial
system,
that
if
there
is
a
criminal
charge
filed
against
a
united
states
national
living
in
the
united
states
that
person's
property
can
be
forfeited
if
the
person
doesn't
go
to
the
foreign
country
to
answer
their
charges.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
rule
that
a
foreign
national
must
come
here
to
defend
against...
well,
or
a
person
with
dual
nationality
must
come
here
to
defend
a
criminal
charge
or
he's
going
to
lose
his
property
automatically.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
it
works
the
other
way
around.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
same
rule
apply
if
a
victim
sued
in
the
district
of
nevada
for
harm
caused
by
an
absent
defendant
based
on
a
crime
in
the
indictment,
an
assault,
say?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
on
a
long
arm
statute
there'd
be
jurisdiction
so
that
that
judgment
would
be
enforceable
personally
against
the
defendant,
i
suppose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
automatic
liability.
well,
not--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
there's
a
prima
facie
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
there
is
a
prima
face
case.
