justice
david
h.
souter
--what...
assuming,
even
apart
from
any
rule,
that
the
failure
to
show
up
made
it
impossible
for
the
government
to
perfect
its
forfeiture
case,
perhaps
because
the
material
forfeited
was
in
the
possession
of
the
defendant,
in
a
case
like
that,
rule
or
no
rule,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
there
would
be
no
due
process
violation
in
disentitling
the
person
to
defend
any
further.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
boils
down
to
a
question
of
money.
it's
not
the
dignity
of
the
court,
you
want
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
to
get
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
in
the
example
that
you
just
gave
does
that
example
support
you?
why,
in
the
case
in
which
the
government
knows
because
of
its
criminal
evidence
the
property
came
from
some
other
source
than
inheritance,
couldn't
the
government
simply
go
to
the
court
and
say,
we
have
evidence
to
rebut?
we
will
make
a
good
faith
offer
of
proof
without
disclosing
the
evidence
itself,
and
therefore
you
in
fact
ought
to
stay
the
proceeding
so
that
we
don't
have
to
disclose
our
case.
i
suppose
your
answer
is,
well,
we
want
the
money,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
fact
is,
in
each
instance
what
it
comes
down
to
is
not
your
incapacity
to
defend
your
own
position,
and
not
your
incapacity,
in
effect,
to
meet
the
evidentiary
position
that
you
feel
is
unfairly
being
foisted
upon
you,
but
rather,
it
comes
down
in
every
instance
to
the
fact
that
you
want
the
property
now
rather
than
the
property
at
some
later
time
when
the
two
proceedings
could
be
dealt
with
in
an
orderly
fashion.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it
all
boils
down
to
kind
of
a
time-money
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
he
has
no
obligation
to
show
up,
i
suppose
the
societal
value
is
even
steven.
it's
neither
positive
nor
negative.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
don't
we
have
a
set
of
rules
that
obligates
him
to
show
up.
you
just
conceded
that
he
wasn't
obligated
to
show
up.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
boils
down
to
your
fear
that
you
would
open
the
door
to
criminal
discovery,
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
your
real
fear
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
answered
a
question
about
that
before,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understood
your
answer.
justice
stevens
alluded
to
the
problem
a
second
ago.
let's
assume
that
he
tries
to
get
criminal
discovery.
why
isn't
it
perfectly
open
to
the
government
in
that
event
to
say,
don't
give
him
the
discovery,
because
if
you
do
you
will
be
providing
discovery
in
fact
in
a
criminal
case
to
which
he
is
not
entitled,
a
case
in
which
he
will
not
appear,
and
for
that
reason,
court,
use
your
discretionary
authority
not
to
allow
discovery.
why
can
the
government
not
be
protected
that
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
not
a
discovery
issue
then.
as
you
say,
it
just
pushes
it
further.
you
want
to
put
in
a
minimal
case.
you
want
him
to
know
as
little
as
possible
consistent
with
your
capacity
to...
in
effect,
to
justify
the
forfeiture.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
discovery.
it's
nondisclosure.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no,
we
realize--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
i
realize
you're
happy
in
that
case,
but
what
it
boils
down
to,
though,
it
seems
to
me,
though,
is
that
as
you
say,
it's
not
really
that
we
can't
protect...
we,
the
government,
cannot
protect
ourselves
in
discovery.
we
simply
don't
want
to
have
to
put
on
a
comprehensive
case,
because
in
doing
so
we
might
provide
some
advantage
to
him
for
use
in
the
later
criminal
case
if
it
is
later
tried.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
help
me
out
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
not
endangering
it.
you're
endangering
it
in
the
sense
that
you
would
be
disclosing
more
of
your
case
than
any
rule
of
criminal
discovery
requires
you
to
disclose.
that's
what
you
mean
by
endanger,
isn't
it?
