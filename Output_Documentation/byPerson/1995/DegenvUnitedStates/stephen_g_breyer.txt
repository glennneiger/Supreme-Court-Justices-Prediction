justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your...
i
take
it
for
pure
purposes
we
could
consider
this
as
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
is
happy
to
send
his
lawyers,
he's
happy
to
comply
with
every
order.
what
he'd
like
to
do
is
send
in
one
piece
of
paper,
which
piece
of
paper
would
be
absolutely
conclusive
in
his
favor,
and
the
judge
says,
i'm
sorry,
i
won't
look
at
the
paper.
since
you're
not
here,
you
lose,
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
since
you're
not
here
in
the
other
case,
you
lose.
now,
we're
used
to
doing
that
in
an
appeal
where,
after
sentencing,
for
example,
the
defendant
runs
away,
and
you
concede
we
can
do
that
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
say,
we
won't
look
at
your
paper,
we
won't
look
at
the
brief,
you
lose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
line
do
you
draw?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
i
say,
what
line
are
you
drawing,
after
all,
there
are
a
lot
of
intermediate
cases.
he
runs
away
before
sentencing.
can
the
judge
then
sentence
him?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if,
in
fact,
the
judge
wants
to
levy
a
fine,
and
he
wants
to
produce
one
piece
of
paper
which
will
show
he
has
no
money,
does
the
judge
have
to
look
at
that
piece
of
paper?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
asking
you
for
your...
i
mean,
you're
absolutely
right
that's
where
i'm
driving.
what
i
want
to
see
is
what's
your
line.
you
agree,
i
take
it,
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
look
at
the
piece
of
paper
when
he
ran
away
before
appeal.
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
look
at
the
piece
of
paper
when
he
runs
away
before
he's
being
fined
at
sentencing.
but
you're
saying
the
judge
does
have
to
look
at
the
piece
of
paper
when
it's
a
forfeiture
of
property,
and
what's
the
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
is
that
the
case
now?
what
is
the
status?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is,
on
that
part
of
it,
is
it...
is
there
a
dispute
with
the
government
over
what
happened?
is
it
the
case
that
he
could
not
come
to
this
proceeding
because,
at
the
request
of
the
united
states,
the
swiss
had
arrested
him,
tried
him,
and
put
him
in
prison?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
we
dealing
with
the
case
of
a
person
who
could
not
show
up
because
he
was
in
prison
because
the
swiss
authorities
acted
on
american
request,
or
not,
or
what
is
the
status
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't
hold
the
same
in
respect
to
misrepresentation
cases,
restitution
cases,
fraud
cases,
dozens
of
other
cases
in
which
the
government
might
have
civil
remedies.
you're
not
going
to
say
all
those,
also,
are
forfeited,
are
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
same,
then,
here.
not--
--the
same,
then,
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
isn't
there
a
difference
between
a
rule
that
says,
you
can't
present...
have
certain
discovery,
present
certain
defenses,
that's
what
people
are
asking
you,
and
a
rule
that
says,
you
can't
come
into
court
at
all.
you
can't
present
any
claim,
any
defense,
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any
international
norm
on
that,
did
you
find?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
international
norm
about
whether
country
anywhere
in
the
world
can
say
to
all
citizens
of
the
world
once
we
file
a
criminal
indictment
against
you,
you
have
to
travel
here,
no
matter
how
far,
and
if
you
don't,
you
lose
all
your
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
ever...
did
you
look
that
up
at
all?
