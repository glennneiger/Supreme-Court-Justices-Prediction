we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
v.
united
states.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
client's
name,
mr.
robbins?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
degen.
very
well.
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
leads
you
to
think
that
congress
wouldn't
have
that
authority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
are
you
talking
about
a
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
a
decision
of
this
court
that
supports
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
your
client
reside
before
he
went
to
switzerland?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
did
he
go
to
switzerland?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
was
the
indictment
handed
down?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if...
supposing
the
district
judge
in
this
case
had
made
a
finding
that
he
left
the
united
states
in
order
to
avoid
pleading
to
the
indictment,
would
that
make
the
outcome
any
different,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
district
court
were
to
order
him
to
appear
in
nevada
for
a
deposition,
could
he
then
be
served
with
criminal
process
in
the
criminal
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
would
that
be
constitutionally
objectionable,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
it
wasn't.
suppose
the
district
judge
says,
we
do
have
these
foreign
claimants,
and
i
always
require
them
to
come
to
reno,
or
las
vegas,
and
give
their
depositions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
district
court
said,
i
don't
require
all
civil
forfeiture
defendants
to
come
to
las
vegas,
but
i'm
going
to
require
you
to
come
to
las
vegas,
because
i'm
exercising
my
discretion
and
that's
the
way
i
choose
to
exercise
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
sound
as
though
your
client
might
be
planning
to
violate
such
an
order.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
robbins.
mr.
estrada,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
defendant's
participation
in
the
civil
forfeiture
threatens
the
criminal
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
couldn't
that
be
dealt
with
by
a
judge
administering
the
civil
discovery
rules?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
no
finding
here,
mr.
estrada,
that
the
petitioner
is
a
fugitive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
page...
you're
talking
about
the
white--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
that
sense
of
the
word,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
one
of
the
government's
possible
losses
if
the
petitioner's
suggestion...
the
same
thing
that
a
statute
of
limitations
would
provide,
witnesses'
recollections
get
stale--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
the
thing
is
brought
to
trial
8
years
from
now,
the
government
may
have
had
a
good
case
now,
but
the
witnesses
may
not
be
around,
they
may
have
died
in
the
meantime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
robbins,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
karen
degen
in
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
a
discovery
order
was
entered
against
her
but
not
against
brian?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
