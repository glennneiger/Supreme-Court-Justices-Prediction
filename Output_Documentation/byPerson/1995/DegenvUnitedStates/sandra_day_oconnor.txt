mr.
robbins,
did
the
petitioner
raise
in
district
court
the
claim
that
the
swiss
arrest
ended
his
fugitive
status?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
was
not
raised
in
the
district
court
because
it
hadn't
occurred.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's--
--but
how
long
can
a...
how
long
can
the
criminal
indictment
stand
without
dismissal
if
he
fails
to
appear
in
response?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
and
presumably
the
government
could
stay
the
civil
forfeiture
and
put
a
hold,
in
effect,
on
any
transfer
of
title
the
property.
the
property
will
be
secure.
so
what
has
the
government
lost?
