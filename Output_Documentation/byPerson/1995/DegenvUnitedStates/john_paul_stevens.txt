mr.
robbins,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
may
recall
that
there
are
some
lawyers
who
argue
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
require
the
two
proceedings
to
be
brought
as
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
heard
such
an
argument.
[laughter]
well,
if
the
constitution
commands
these
proceedings
be
treated
as
one,
how
can
you
consistently
argue
in
this
case
that
we
must
treat
them
as
totally
separate--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
is
the
heart
of
your
argument,
that
we
should
ignore
the
criminal
case
and
just
look
at
what
can
be
done
in
the
civil
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
constitutionally
permissible
for
us
to
treat
them
as
separate
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
estrada,
wouldn't
that
be
possible
even
if
he
appeared
in
the
criminal
case,
that
he
could
use
civil
discovery
in
the
forfeiture
case
to
find
out
the
same
information?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
couldn't
they
have
done
that
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
estrada,
by
hypothesis
you're
assuming
you
can
never
compel
him
to
come
to
the
united
states,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
other
than
by
this...
by
using
the
civil
procedure
to
do
so.
if
you
can't
compel
him
to
stand
trial
on
the
criminal
case,
you
haven't
lost
anything
by
proving
and
winning
your
civil
case.
you
still
get
the
same
property,
but
you
had
to
prove
it
instead
of
using
this
sanction
to
get
it,
and
you
end
up
with
the
property
but
no
criminal
judgment,
and
the
reason
you
can't
get
a
criminal
judgment
is
you
don't
have
authority
to
compel
him
to
come
from
switzerland
to
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
still
end
up
with
exactly
the
same
result.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
not
buying
his
way
out
of
it,
he's
just
staying
in
switzerland.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
haven't
given
it
up
for
good.
the
only
thing
you've
given
up
is
by
putting
in
your
proof
you've
disclosed
to
him
the
witnesses
who
will
testify
against
him
in
the
criminal
case.
that's
the
only
thing
you
have
to
give
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
tactical
advantage
in
the
criminal
case
may
or
may
not
be
all
that
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he's
not
getting
any
discovery.
i'm
assuming
that
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
could
say,
you
can
have
no
discovery,
but
he's
going
to
say
to
you,
you
can't
get
the
property
without
proving
you're
entitled
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
you
are.
aren't
you
saying
you're
entitled
to
the
property
even
without
the
prima
facie
showing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you've
made
the
prima
facie
showing,
why
haven't
you
already
disclosed
your
case,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
take
the
same
position
even
if
he
were
not
an
american
citizen,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
also
you'd
say
the
government
could
take...
congress
could
pass
a
statute
saying
that
anyone
who's
been
indicted
and
who
does
not
appear
in
due
course
without...
all
his
property
may
be
forfeited,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
subject
to
notice
and
ability
to
appear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
could
prove
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you're
entitled
to
it
if
you
can
prove
it,
but
you
want
to
get
it
without
proving
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
