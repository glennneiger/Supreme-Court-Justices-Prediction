justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
it
cannot
be
squared
with
due
process,
mr.
robbins,
do
you
mean
that
if
congress
had
enacted
such
a
provision
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
congress
wouldn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
civil
matter,
though.
you
wouldn't
argue--
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
said
that
that's
okay
in
civil
matters,
where
the
reason
the
person
doesn't
want
to
appear
generally
is
that
he
will
be
served
in
other
civil
cases.
we've
said
it's
perfectly
okay
for
a
state
to
say,
you
make
a
general
appearance
or
you
do
not
appear
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
that
it's
a
lot
easier
to
say
it
for
the
criminal
case.
the
interest
of
the
state
is
much
greater.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
not,
you
would
say
that
if
they
are
brought
as
separate
proceedings
they
have
to
be
treated
as
separate
proceedings.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
very
irrational
position,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
guess
the
actual
parallel
in
the
state
civil
case
anyway
would
not
be
whether
you
subject
yourself
to
general
counterclaims
or
whatnot
that
are
relevant
to
that
suit,
but
rather,
i
guess
the
parallel
would
be
a
state
that
says
if
you
make
even
a
special
appearance
in
one
case
you
are
liable
to
being
sued
in
separate
cases.
i
don't
know
any
state
that
does
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
isn't
that
separate
a
case.
i
mean,
certainly
that's
what
the
government
is
going
to
argue
in
these
cases.
it
would
be
quite
different
if
it
were
a
totally
unrelated
piece
of
civil
litigation
that
you're
talking
about,
but
this
is,
in
fact,
simply
a
piece
of
civil
litigation
that
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
criminal
case.
why
can't
we
consider
them
effectively
joined?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
appellate
proceedings
did
not
relate
to
the
same
court,
that
they
didn't
have
to
do
with
an
offense
to
the
dignity
of
the
same
court,
and
therefore
couldn't
be
within
the
inherent
powers
of
that
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here
it
is
the
same
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
was
only
the
appellate
process
that
was
the
business
of
that
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
had
to
do
with
the
identity
of
courts
rather
than
the
absolute
identity
of
lawsuits.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
it
isn't
as
though
the
congress
hasn't
addressed
this
problem.
it
has,
and
it
has
given
you
a
remedy.
the
remedy
is
to
stay
the
civil
action
until
the
criminal
action
is
completed,
and
you
say
that
remedy
is
inadequate.
well,
maybe
go
back
to
congress
and
get
an
additional
remedy
for
this
kind
of
a
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that's
no
problem
if
we're
worried
about
foreign
countries
copying
us
and
thereby
prejudicing
american
citizens.
many
foreign
countries
already
allow
criminal
prosecutions
in
absentia--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
situation
is
already
worse
than
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
estrada,
tell
us
about
fugitives
from
justice.
is
it,
indeed,
not
an
obligation
of
a
citizen
to
present
himself
when
he
knows
that
there's
an
arrest
warrant
out
for
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
separate
crime,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
separate
crime
to
be
a
fugitive
from
justice.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
because
there's
no
use
in
it.
the
guy's
already
a
fugitive
from
one
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
purpose
of
such
a
statute
would
make
him
a
fugitive
from
two
crimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
could
have
another
statute
making
it
a
crime
not
to
end
your
fugitive
status.
that
would
be
three
crimes
that
you
can
violate.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he'll
probably
die
before
the
government
does.
you'll
get
it
eventually.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
at
that
point
you
go
ahead
with
the
civil
case.
he's
beyond
your
criminal
punishment
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
that
same
exchange,
what
is
the
argument
when
you
said,
i
would
point
out,
your
honor,
that
mr.
degen
is
no
longer
a
claimant
in
this
case,
he's
merely
a
witness?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
against
the
law,
you
mean
not
criminal?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
question
whether
it's
not
against
the
law,
to
fail
to
appear.
