justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robbins,
i
thought
you
were
not
contesting
that
as
far
as
the
forfeiture
is
concerned
mr.
degen
would
have
to
be
treated
like
any
other
litigant,
so
if
he
didn't
show
up,
say,
for
a
deposition,
didn't
comply
with
all
the
discovery
requirements,
out
he
goes.
i
thought
that
you
were
saying
as
far
as
the
forfeiture
proceeding
is
concerned,
he
can't
have
any
advantage
because
of
his
fugitive
status,
and
if
i'm
wrong
in
that,
please
tell
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
your
case
was,
he
has
a
right,
the
right
that
any
litigant
would
have,
to
defend
the
forfeiture
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he's
not
stripped
of
that
right
because
there's
a
criminal
prosecution
against
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
to
the
forfeiture
proceeding,
he
would
have
to
comply
with
all
the
requirements
the
court
would
impose
on
anyone
who's
contesting
a
forfeiture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robbins,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
special
or
general
appearance,
you
indicated
that
that
was
right
that
a
state
could
say,
either
you
stay
out
and
forfeit
whatever
we
have,
or
you
come
in
for
all
purposes,
but
my
understanding
is
that
on
the
federal
side
if
the
property
is
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
you
could
make
a
limited
appearance
and
say,
i'm
coming
in
for
purposes
of
defending
my
property,
but
nothing
else
that
i
own
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the
court's
authority.
i
thought
that's...
on
the
federal
side,
that
has
been
the
federal
practice,
whatever
the
texas
rule
may
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what
a
limited
appearance
is.
i'm
there,
i'm
fighting
out
the
case,
but
the
only
thing
that's
going
to
be
subject
to
the
judgment
is
the
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
hasn't
been
tried
yet
in
switzerland?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
does--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
he
does,
why
not
handle
it
at
that
stage
instead
of
saying
you...
you're
at
total
default.
we
are
predicting
what's
going
to
happen
if
we
were
to
allow
you
to
come
in
and
defend,
and
mr.
estrada,
one
striking
difference
between
this
and
molinaro,
where
the
fugitive
entitlement
doctrine
started,
there
the
defendant
is
away
and
he
says,
aha,
if
i'm
vindicated
on
appeal,
i'll
come
home,
but
if
they're
going
to
affirm
my
conviction...
so
there
was
no
way
to
enforce
the
court's
judgment.
here,
all
the
property
is
arrested.
it's
in
the
court's
control,
so
he
can't
get
his
hands
on
any
of
that
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
estrada,
suppose
the
defendant
says,
i
don't
want
to
face
a
total
forfeiture,
and
i
realize
this
argument
you're
making.
i
would
rather
have
some
defense
than
none,
so
if
the
district
court
wants
to
issue
any
kind
of
protective
orders
so
that
i
won't
get
premature...
a
pre-vision
of
the
criminal
case,
so
be
it,
but
at
least
give
me
some
chance
to
defend.
the
government,
in
order
to
effect
its
interest
in
not
having
more
disclosure
than
in
the
criminal
case
doesn't
have
to
say,
you
can't
come
in
at
all.
it
can
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
he
could
defend
that
would
not
involve
disclosing
the
government's
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
with
respect
to
that,
don't
you
have
authority,
or
couldn't
an
authority
be
exercised
over
him
if
congress
so
chose
that
could
not
be
exercised
over
someone
who's
not
a
citizen,
and
there
is
the
old
blackmer
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
authority
to
call
back
our
citizens
to
answer
for
charges
here,
but
that
kind
of
subpoena
wasn't
sent
to
him,
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
estrada,
what
is
the
difference...
what
does
the
government
lose
when
it
has
the
funds
in
the
court,
what
can't
it
do
that
it
could
do
if
the
forfeiture
had
gone
through
as
you're
urging?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
put
them
in
an
interest-bearing
account.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
question
is,
that's...
is
there
something
concrete,
that's
different
about
saying,
we're
entitled
to
it
now,
and
saying
we've
got
the
principal
in
the
bank
and
we're
getting
interest
on
it,
and
so
we're
getting
the
time
value,
we're
getting...
we're
not
getting
the
principal,
but
we're
getting
the
interest?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
robbins,
what
they
did,
what
they
showed
is
comparable
to
what
a
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
in
the
case
of
an
ordinary
civil
default
judgment,
right,
make
an
ex
parte
showing
of
the
entitlement
to
money
damages.
