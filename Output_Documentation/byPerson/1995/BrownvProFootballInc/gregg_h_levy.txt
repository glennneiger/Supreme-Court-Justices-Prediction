mr.
gregg
h.
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
following
up
on
one
of
mr.
starr's
answers
to
justice
breyer's
question,
and
that
is
a
question,
or
an
answer
about
the
choice
required
of
certain
unionized
employees.
i
agree
with
petitioners
that
in
certain
unionized
industries
employees
have
a
choice
to
make,
but
it
is
not
the
choice
that
petitioners
assert.
it
is
not
a
choice
between
labor
law
rights
and
whatever
antitrust
rights
they
may
have.
the
choice,
instead,
is
between
collective
bargaining
with
a
single
employer
that
bargains
independently,
and
collective
bargaining
with
a
multiemployer
bargaining
unit,
a
group
of
employers
that
bargain
collectively
as
if
they
were
a
single
entity.
the
problem
with
petitioner's
position
is
that
they
want
to
have
it
both
ways.
they
want
to
take
full
advantage
of
the
enormous
benefits
which
this
court
recognized
in
bonanno
linen
that
employees
receive
when
employers
act
collectively
in
the
bargaining
process,
but
at
the
same
time,
they
also
want
to
exploit
the
leverage
of
the
antitrust
laws
which
they
can
do
only
by
claiming
that
each
member
of
the
multiemployer
unit
is
required
to
act
not
collectively
but
independently.
that
fundamental
inconsistency
pervades
petitioners'
every
argument.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
union,
multiemployer
bargaining
is
voluntary.
the
union
may
withdraw
its
consent
at
any
time
before
the
bargaining
process
begins,
but
once
it
begins,
multiemployer
bargaining
is
a
bilateral
process
providing
rights
and
obligations
that
both
sides
must
observe,
and
that
neither
side
can
escape.
that
was
the
essence
of
this
court's
opinion
in
bonanno
linen.
once
bargaining
began,
each
employer
was
bound
by
its
election
to
engage
in
multiemployer
bargaining.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
there
may
come
a
time,
your
honor.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
if
the
employees
ultimately
elect,
in
good
faith,
and
not
as
a
strategic
matter
to
engage...
to
get
additional
leverage
in
the
collective
bargaining
process,
to
give
up
their
rights
under
the
law
laws,
but
i
would
argue
that
as
long
as
they
continue
to
bargain
collectively,
that--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--once
the
employers
give
up
their
bargaining
rights,
the
employee...
excuse
me.
once
the
employees
give
up
their
bargaining
rights,
the
employers
could
not
take
any
affirmative
steps,
exercise
their
economic
weapons
under
the
bargaining
process.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
of
course
there
is.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--i
can't
answer
that
question
as
to
why
you
can't
find
it,
but
there
is
no
question,
your
honor,
that
congress
intended
to
encourage
the
practice
of
multiemployer
bargaining.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
the
board
has
spoken
on
that
subject,
your
honor.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
in
its
brief
in
bonanno
linen
which
this
court
quoted
in
its
opinion
in
bonanno
linen.
the
board
made
clear
that
among
the
economic
weapons
available
to
the
employers
after
impasse
was
to
implement
unilaterally
the
terms
of
its
last
good
faith
bargaining
proposal.
the
board
has
spoken
on
that,
and
in
its
decisions
the
board
has
repeatedly
made
clear
in
contexts
involving
multiemployer
bargaining
that
unilateral
implementation
of
the
last
good
faith
bargaining
proposal
is
a...
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
it
is
a
traditional
weapon.
now,
it
was
only
a
few
months
ago,
in
the
silverman
case,
which
we
cited
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
when
the
major
league
baseball
implemented
a
unilateral
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
that
the
baseball
players
went
to
the
board,
and
the
board
agreed
with
the
baseball
players'
position
that
that
term
had
not
been
unilaterally
implemented
in
accordance
with
the
labor
laws.
and
only
6
weeks
later
the
nlrb
had
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
court...
against
the
baseball
employers'
implementation
of
that
term,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
football
players
should
have
done
here.
they
had
a
remedy
if
they
were
of
the
view
that
the
unilateral
implementation
of
these
terms
was
not
in
good
faith.
their
remedy
was
to
go
to
the
labor
board.
they
could
have
done
that
and
had
a
ruling
within
weeks.
instead,
we've
had
6
years
of
expensive
antitrust
litigation
that
has
plagued
the
defendants,
it
has
plagued
the
courts,
and
it
has
poisoned
labor
relations
in
this
industry.
congress
provided
a
remedy
for
this.
if
there's
anything
inappropriate,
or
if
the
employers
implement
terms
that
are
unreasonable.
the
players
elected
not
to
pursue
those
remedies
here.
in
bonanno
linen,
to
get
back
to
bonanno
linen,
the
court
made
clear
that
once
the
collective
bargaining
process
begins,
the
multiemployer
bargaining
process
begins,
both
sides
are
bound
by
the
rules
and
terms
that
apply
in
collective
bargaining
and
the
rules
and
terms
that
apply
to
multiemployer
bargaining
units.
and
in
justice
stevens'
concurring
opinion,
justice
stevens
pointed
out
that
the
individual
employer
who
wanted
to
withdraw
from
the
multiemployer
unit
in
bonanno
linen
knew
what
the
rules
were
when
it
chose
voluntarily
to
participate
in
the
multiemployer
bargaining
process,
and
he
wrote
that
there
was
nothing
inappropriate
about
requiring
that
employer
to
abide
by
those
rules
throughout
the
bargaining
process.
the
same
is
true
here.
this
case
is
nothing
more
than
the
flip
side
of
bonanno
linen.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
in
this
industry
at
least,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
bargaining
process
itself
never
comes
to
an
end.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
the
nba
players
represented
to
the
court
in
the
second
circuit
in
williams,
in
a
passage
that
we
quoted
from
a
brief,
everybody
knows
in
this
industry
that
there's--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--no.
impasse
is
merely
a
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
process,
your
honor.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
everybody...
everybody
may
anticipate--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--no,
everybody
anticipates
that
there
will
be
impasse,
but
everybody
also
anticipates
that
impasse
will
ultimately
be
broken.
that's
what
the
labor
board
has
repeatedly
said,
that
impasse--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--i
believe
that
a
real
impasse,
as
the
labor
board
has
articulated
it,
is
simply
a
temporary
stage
in
the
process.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
but
the
nlrb
has--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--in
theory,
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
theory,
that's
right.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
that's
right,
although
i
would
condition
that
by
saying
that
if
decertification
were
intended
merely
to
allow
the
union
to
gain
additional
leverage
in
collective
bargaining,
that
the
antitrust
laws
should
not
kick
in.
that's
sort
of
strategic
decertification,
or
tactical
certification,
in
my
view
is
disruptive
of
a
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well,
justice
scalia,
it
is
not
a
new
concept.
that
issue
was
litigated
in
the
district
court
in
mcneil,
and
the
court
found
on
summary
judgment
that
there
had
been
no
sham
decertification
even
though
the
nfl
claimed
that
that
was
what
happened
during
the
1970's
when
the
union
decertified.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
i
would
like
to
add
this
wrinkle,
your
honor,
that
certainly
after
the
union
decertifies
affirmative
steps,
affirmative
exercise
of
economic
weapons
taken
by
the
employers
is
not
protected
by
the
nonstatutory
labor
exemption.
there
is
a
question
which
the
courts
have
not
addressed
about
what
happens
to
steps
that
the
employers
have
taken
prior
to
decertification
that
remain
in
place
after
the
union
decertifies.
in
that
situation,
while
the
courts
have
not
addressed
it
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
it
would
presumably
be
appropriate
or
necessary
for
the
employers
to
have
at
least
some
period
of
time,
a
reasonable
period
of
time
to
adjust
their
conduct
to
bring
it
in
conformity
with
the
antitrust
laws,
otherwise
you
have
the
anomalous
situation
of
a
private
party
controlling
whether
or
not
prior
conduct
taken
by
the
employers
that
was
lawful
on
day
1
became
unlawful
on
day
2,
and
that,
i
think,
would
be
an
inappropriate
course
for
the
court
to
take,
but
of
course,
that
issue
isn't
presented
here.
with
that
caveat,
though,
i
do
agree
with
judge
edwards.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
i
don't
think
that's
the
choice
the
employees
are
confronted
with,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--i--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--i
think
there's
an
intermediate
choice
for
the
employees,
and
that
is,
they
could
decide
no
longer
to
participate
in
the
multiemployer
bargaining
process.
once
that
happens,
once
there's
no
multiemployer
bargaining,
then
you
have
a
situation
where--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--it
so...
the
employees
can
certainly
make
that
choice
before
the
bargaining
process
begins.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
at
impasse,
no,
i
don't
think
the
employees
can
make
that
choice.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
i
think
that's
right
if
you
accept
the
premise
that
they
do
have
rights
under
the
sherman
act,
that's
right,
there
is
a
choice
to
be
made
there.
but
the
labor
laws
are
structured
in
such
a
way
that--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--no,
they
have
always--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--well,
this
is--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--this
is
not
the
type
of
situation
like
the
livadas
case,
to
which
mr.
starr
referred,
where
a
state
court
imposed
a
penalty
on
an
employee's
decision
to
exercise
his
labor
law
rights.
in
livadas,
justice
souter
made
clear
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
that
if
a
federal
statute
were
to
impose
the
same
choice,
the
issue
would
be
entirely
different.
the
issue
then
would
be
one
of
statutory
harmonization,
i
think
is
the
phrase
that
was
used,
and
what
we're
asked...
what
the
process
that's
required
here
is
the
process
of
harmonizing
the
requirements
of
the
antitrust
laws
with
the
requirements
of
the
labor
laws.
the
key
point
here,
though
is,
as
justice
breyer
suggested
earlier
in
the
morning,
is
that
the
conduct
that
is
at
issue
here
is
really
conduct
that
is
at
the
core
of
the
labor
laws,
that
at
most
it's
at
the
very
periphery
of
the
antitrust
laws.
this
conduct
is
conduct
that
is...
that
involves
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
i
would
assume
that
there
is--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--your
honor,
that
at
some
point
the
board
could
be
asked
to
determine
whether
there
is
any
prospect
of
further
use
of
economic
weapons
ultimately
leading
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well,
one
approach
would
be
for
the
employees
to
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
board,
just
as
they
could
have
done
here.
the
players,
in
our
view,
could
have
filed
that
unfair
labor
practice
charge
days
after
the
nfl
decided
unilaterally
to
implement
the
salary
term.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
contending
that
the
parties
were
not
at
impasse,
an
issue
that
they've
stipulated
to
here,
or
that
the
proposal
was
not
made
in
good
faith.
they
could
have
argued
that
$1,000
a
week
wasn't
enough,
that
to
be
a
reasonable
proposal
it
had
to
be
$2,000
a
week,
but
they
never
pursued
that.
that
is
the
remedy
that
the
labor
laws
have
afforded
them,
and
that's--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--it
has
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
proposal
has
been
made
in
good
faith
and
negotiated
in
good
faith.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
they
could...
one
factor
that
they
could
look
at
is
to
look
at
the
terms
of
the
offer.
i
don't
have
any
illusions
here
that
if
the
nfl
had
implemented
unilateral...
or
unilaterally
terms
that
would
have
paid
these
employees
minimum
wage,
that...
about
what
the
nlrb
would
have
said
in
those
circumstances.
they
would
have
said
that
in
the
context
presented
that
proposal
was
not
made
in
good
faith,
but
here
the
proposal
was
$1,000
a
week,
the
employees
had
the
right
to
go
to
the
nlrb
to
challenge
whether
or
not
that
term
was
sufficient,
as
one
indication
of
whether
it
was
negotiated
in
good
faith,
and
they
elected
not
to
do
that.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
that's
right.
in
fact--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--other
than
to
say
that
impasse--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--is
a
temporary
phase
in
the
process,
i
don't
know,
but
your
prediction
is,
or
your
suggestion
is
precisely
what
happened
in
the
eighties
in
the
mcneil
case,
where
after...
or
in
the
powell
case.
after
the
eighth
circuit
decided
powell,
on
the
next
business
day
the
nfl
players
association
came
to
the
nfl
and
said,
we're
at
impasse,
even
though
the
district
court
in
that
case
had
made
it
clear
that
the
parties'
positions
weren't
that
far
apart.
and
why
did
they
say
they
were
at
impasse?
because
they
thought,
they
had
the
view
that
that
would
allow
them
to
move
forward
and
file
an
antitrust
suit,
and
to
get
the
leverage
that
an
antitrust
suit
would
provide
them
in
the
collective
bargaining
process.
that
is
an
incentive...
given
the
compulsive
power,
the
coercive
power
of
an
antitrust
suit,
treble
damages
and
attorneys'
fees,
and
the
possibility
of
the
intervention
of
the
antitrust
enforcement
authorities,
it
is
a
very
powerful
addition
to
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
i
think
not,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
request
for
chevron
deference,
for
example--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--no,
but
there
has
been
no
request
by
the
agency
for
that
sort
of
deference,
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
that
i
think
is
relevant--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--no,
this
is
an
issue
for
the...
they
haven't
even
made
a
request
for
it.
this
is
an
issue
which
the
agencies
are
entitled
to
no
deference,
and
it's
the
role
of
the
courts
to
determine
what
the
appropriate
interplay
is
of
the
labor
laws
and
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
i
think
that
the
board
has
provided
plenty
of
ingredients
upon
which
this
court
has
relied
in
the
past
and
upon
which
it
should
rely
here
to
shape
the
court's
opinion.
it
has
made
clear,
for
example,
that
impasse
is
a
transient
stage
in
the
process.
it
has
made
clear
that
unilateral
implementation
of
employment
terms
is
an
authorized
economic
weapon.
it
has
made
clear
that
multiemployer
bargaining
is
favored.
those
are
all
items
as
to
which
this
court
said
in
buffalo
as
well
as
bonanno
linen--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--but
we
don't
know
why,
your
honor,
and
i
suggest
that
part
of
the
reason
that
we
don't
know
why
is
that
the
board
is
not
prepared
to
sign
on
to
some
of
the
views
of
the
labor
laws
that
are
articulated
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
but
on
the
question
of
deference,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
one
other
point
that--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--you
don't.
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
you
entirely.
there
has
been
no
request
for
deference
of
any
kind
here.
the
only
conclusion
that
i
think
you
can
draw
here
is
that
the...
that
this
court,
in
reliance
on
the
principles
that
have
been
articulated
by
the
board
in
other
decisions
in
other
cases,
in
other
briefs
and
representations
to
this
court,
including
in
bonanno
linen
itself,
and
we
cited
the
nlrb's
brief
in
bonanno
linen,
and
this
court
cited
it
in
its
opinion
itself,
that
those
views
ought
to
be
the
ones
that
shape
this
court's
opinion
to
the
extent
that
it
needs
the
views
of
any
agency
in
determining
the
appropriate
intersection
of
these
two
bodies
of
law.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well,
i'd
start
with
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
in
powell,
your
honor,
which...
when
there's
never
been
an
agreement,
excuse
me,
or
where
there's
been
no
agreement
on
the--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--yes.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
in
the
powell
case
is
one
example.
there's
wetterau
foods
in
the
eighth
circuit,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
no
cases
in
this
court,
no.
there
are
only
four
cases
that...
in
which
this
court
has
directly
addressed
the
exemption.
each
of
those
cases
did
involve
an
agreement,
but
the
court
never
held
that
an
agreement
was
necessary,
and
i
think
all
parties
here,
including
the
government
and
the
dissent
below,
recognized
that
agreement
is
not
necessary--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--well--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--in
part
i
would
answer
your
question
by
saying
that
labor
has
agreed
to
the
process,
and
the
process
includes
an
arrangement
whereby
employers
collectively
can
act
together
as
a
single
entity
in
collective
bargaining.
they
may
together,
as
a
single
entity,
implement
proposed
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
that
have
been
bargained
in
good
faith
to
impasse.
in
effect,
what
the
labor
laws
have
done
here
is
that
they
have
removed
the
agreement,
if
you
will,
among
the
employers
by
treating
the
employers
in
the
context
presented
here
as
a
single
employer.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
in
the
multiemployer--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--in
the
multiemployer
context,
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
if
the
employers
agreed
to
lock
out
their
employees
at
impasse
there's
no
question
that
that
conduct
would
be
protected
by
the
nonstatutory
labor
exemption,
even
the
petitioners
state
that,
and
that's
a
classic
example
of
an
agreement
among
the
employers,
if
you
will,
that
does
not
involve
any
consent
or
agreement
of
employees.
you
couldn't
imagine
any
action
taken
by
the
employers
to
which
the
employees
would
be
more
likely
to
object
than
a
lock
out.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
if
you
accept
the
premise
that
the
antitrust
laws
apply
to
a
labor
market--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--i
would
agree
entirely--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--your
honor,
that
is
subject
to
the...
and
that's
the
reason
why,
if
the
employees
agree,
or
the
employees
decide
not
to
participate
in
multiemployer
collective
bargaining,
that
there
is
no
antitrust
issue
of
any
kind
presented
here.
that's
sort
of
an
intermediate
stage
for
employees
in
numerous
industries.
they
want
to
have
the
benefits
that
are
afforded
by
multiemployer
bargaining,
joint
pensions,
health
benefits,
all
of
those
sorts
of
things
that
the
court
recognized
in
bonanno
linen,
but
they
also
want
to
treat
the
employers
as
separate
entities
when
it
suits
their
bargaining
interests.
one
point
i
wanted
to
mention
in
response
to
mr.
starr's
comments
about
the
notion
of
monopsony,
and
this
shouldn't
take
long,
but
there
are
a
couple
of
points
i
ought
to
make
with
regard
to
that
issue,
because
the
notion
of
monopsony,
the
concept
of
monopsony
pervades
the
petitioners'
brief,
but
it
is
quite
interesting
that
that
concept
never
appears
anywhere
in
the
briefs
for
the
government,
the
antitrust
enforcement
agencies.
the
reasons
are
two.
first
and
most
important,
there
is
no
possibility
here
that
the
nfl
could
have
exercised
monopsony
power
in
this
market.
the
reason
is
that
there's
only
one
seller
in
the
market.
the
only
seller
in
the
market
was
the
union,
and
the
union
is
no
less
a
monopolist
here
than
the
nfl
is
a
monopsonist.
in
fact,
the
unions--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--the
collective
bargaining
agreement
did
preserve
the
right--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--well,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
didn't
preserve
the
right
for
these
players--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--to
negotiate
their
own
salaries.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
well,
your
honor,
each
of
the
employees
may
have
been
negotiating
their
salaries,
but
they
were
doing
so
through
the
auspices
of
the
union,
through
the
auspices
of
the
national
football
league
players
association.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
they
do,
but
they
are
agents
of
the
union,
they
are
not
agents
of
the
players,
your
honor.
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
they're
represented
as
the
union.
but
putting
that
aside,
the
record
flatly
contradicts
the
notion
that
for
these
players,
that
the
nfl
was
the
only
purchaser
of
services
in
the
market.
the
record
is
quite
clear
at
pages
2004
and
5
of
the
court
of
appeals
joint
appendix,
as
one
example,
that
the
canadian
football
league
and
the
arena
football
league
were
active
in
this
market.
they
hired
some
members
of
the
petitioner
class
before
they
were
developmental
squad
players
for
the
nfl,
and
others
they
hired
after,
so
there's
no
reason
that
monopsony
ought
to
be
an
issue
here.
finally,
one
point
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
the
employees
are
not
without
weapons
for
remedies
of
their
own
if
harsh
or
unreasonable
employment
terms
are
imposed
by
the
employer.
first
and
most
important,
as
we've
noted,
the
employer's
right
to
implement
an
impasse
is
limited
only
to
proposals
that
have
been
negotiated
in
good
faith.
the
nlrb
stands
ready,
as
it
did
in
silverman,
to
enforce
that
requirement
if
unreasonable
terms
of
unduly
restrictive
terms
are
imposed.
second,
and
very
important,
the
union
has
economic
weapons
of
its
own.
the
union
can
call
a
strike,
it
can
authorize
a
slow
down,
it
can
engage
in
peaceful
picketing
in
an
effort
to
persuade
management
to
accommodate
the
union's
views.
none
of
those
steps
were
taken
here.
third--
mr.
gregg
h.
levy
--well,
the...
to
give
just
one
example,
the
players
could...
they
don't...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
a
football
game.
it
could
be
in
practice.
the
players
could
refuse
to
report
to
practice.
they
could
do
any
one
of
a
number
of
things
that
would,
in
effect,
make
life
more
difficult
for
their
employers,
but
the
weapons
aren't
limited
to
a
slowdown.
they
could
call
a
strike.
they
could
engage
in
picketing.
those
are
traditional
weapons
that
the
labor
laws
afford
to
employees,
none
of
which
were
selected
here.
and
third
and
most
important,
the
union
can
return
to
the
bargaining
table.
once
negotiations
resume,
the
employers
remain
obligated
to
negotiate
in
good
faith.
they
remain
obligated,
for
example,
to
provide
employees
financial
information
that
can
be
used
for
the
collective
bargaining
process.
they
remain
obligated
to
bargain
collectively
as
a
multiemployer
unit.
this
court
recognized
in
bonanno
linen
that
in
almost
every
situation
such
steps
are
appropriate
and
effective
in
breaking
a
bargaining
impasse.
the
same
would
have
happened
here,
i
submit,
if
instead
of
filing
an
antitrust
suit
the
players
had
returned
to
the
bargaining
table
with
the
national
football
league.
i
appreciate
the
court's
attention.
