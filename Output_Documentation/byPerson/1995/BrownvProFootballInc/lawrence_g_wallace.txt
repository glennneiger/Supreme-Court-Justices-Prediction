mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
it
is
unusual--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--for
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
speak
to
issues
of
antitrust
law.
they're
not
issues
that
have
come
before
the
board.
we
worked
with
the
board
and
its
staff
in
preparing
our
position,
and
we
have
a
footnote
at
the
end
of
our
brief
which
reflects
the
board's
view
on
this
judgment
and
says
that
it's
erroneous
and
would
be
detrimental
to
labor
as
well
as
antitrust
policy,
but
beyond--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
understand
that,
your
honor.
the...
we...
the
board
operates
through
majority
vote.
it
was
undergoing
some
transitions
in
membership
at
the
time
we
briefed
this
case
on
an
accelerated
schedule,
and
it
was
not
practical
for
us
to
go
beyond
what
we
had
been
authorized
to
say
at
the
petition
stage.
and
i
know
the
other
side
is
trying
to
draw
solace
from
the
fact
that
the
board
said
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
rather
than
saying
nothing,
but
i
think
that
that
cuts
more
against
them
than
in
their
favor.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
filed
a
brief,
and
the
brief
was
prepared
in
collaboration
and
consultation
with
the
board's
staff,
and
they
were
consulting
with
the
members.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
distinction
between
whether
there
is
antitrust
scrutiny
available
and
whether
there
is
an
antitrust
violation.
this
court's
decision
in
connell
construction
company
is
a
holding,
with
all
respect,
justice
breyer,
that
labor
and
antitrust
do
mix,
and
that
the
exemption
did
not
extend
to
the
particular
negotiation
that
was
involved
there
in
trying
to
get
the
employer...
that
was
a
dissenting
view
in
connell
that
antitrust
scrutiny
had
to
be
ousted,
but
the
majority
of
the
court
held
to
the
contrary,
and
we
have
suggested
in
the
latter
two
thirds
of
our
footnote
5
in
our
brief,
that
there
are
other
ways
to
accommodate
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
applying
the
antitrust
laws
without--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--expanding
the
exemption.
yes,
justice--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
recognize
that
can
be
a
difficulty,
although
not
a
difficulty
of
much
consequence
in
a
case
of
this
nature
in
which
the
employers
are
imposing
new
terms
that
were
not
included
in
the
expired
agreement,
and
they're
going
beyond
anything
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
have
required
them
to
adhere
to
prior
to
impasse.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
no
doubt
that
that
is
true,
and
that
bargaining
can
continue,
and
bargaining
collaboration
among
employers
in
a
multiemployer
unit
can
continue,
but
the
question--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
national
labor
relations
act
requires
them
to
abide
by
terms
of
the
expired
agreement
until
impasse
is
reached,
so
their
conduct
is
governed
by
that.
after
that,
there
is...
they
would
not
be
violating
any
requirement
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
act
individually
in
making
any
changes
that
they
choose
to
make.
the
question
is,
to
what
extent
do...
does
the
labor
act
require
collaboration
among
employers,
not
all
of
whom
in
these
multiemployer
groups
are
operating
a
sports
league
where
there
is
collaboration
necessitated
under
a
quite--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
fact
that
it
permits
it,
or
has
a
remedy
for
it,
is
not
enough
for
the
judiciary
to
find
an
implied
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
when
congress
never
expressly
granted
an
exemption,
and
under
this
court's
holdings
it's
only
an
exemption
that
is
by
necessary
implication
flowing
from
the
very
existence
of
the
scheme
of
the
labor
act
that
is
to
be
recognized--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
the
minimum
extent
necessary.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
our
view
is
that
after
impasse
the
employers
cannot
in
concert
agree
to
change
the
terms
under
which
they
will
pay
without
antitrust
scrutiny
being
applicable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
relevant
to
whether
it's
a
permissible
change
for
individual
members
of
the
unit
to
make
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
or
for
that
matter
it
wouldn't
violate
the
national
labor
relations
act
for
the
group
to
make
the
change
after
impasse,
but
it
would
be
subject
to
antitrust
scrutiny,
which
might
very
well
apply
a
rule
of
reason
in
the
context
of
a
sports
league
where
you
can't
field
teams
individually.
it's
quite
different
from--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
a
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach,
and
i
think
it
would
be
improvident
for
this
court
to
reach
it,
especially
since
it
isn't
presented
or
briefed
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
antitrust
scrutiny
is
something
that
draws
distinctions
depending
on
circumstances
and
justifications
for
restraints
that
can
be
very
different
if
you're
trying
to
field
teams
against
one
another
in
comparison
with--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--producing
motion
pictures,
for
example,
where
one
can
go
ahead
without
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
never
said
it
would
not
violate
the
rule
of
reason.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
said
that
it...
i
wouldn't
suggest
affirming.
i...
what
i
suggested
is
that
antitrust
scrutiny
doesn't--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
rule
of
reason
doesn't
necessarily
mean
the
defendant
wins.
the
defendant
still
has
to
make
a
showing
that
satisfies
the
rule
of
reason.
it
just
means
that
it's
not
a
per
se
violation.
