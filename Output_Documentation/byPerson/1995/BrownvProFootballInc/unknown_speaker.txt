unknown
speaker
is
mackey
a
case
from
this
court,
mr.
starr?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
the
30
years
you're
talking
about,
what,
dates
from
radovich?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
there
were
no
contrary
decisions
from
the
courts
of
appeals
during
this
period?
unknown
speaker
so
the...
so
it's
from--
unknown
speaker
--the
powell...
powell
is
an
eighth
circuit
case,
too,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
eighth
circuit
thought
powell
was
inconsistent
with
mackey?
unknown
speaker
then
why
doesn't
the
exemption
disappear
in
any
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
the
date
at
which
the
agreement
expires?
i
mean,
in
theory,
why
isn't
there
a
violation
during
the
negotiation
period
that
you're
talking
about,
whether
or
not
that
negotiation
ultimately
results
in
an
agreement?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
then
the
criterion
is
not
agreement.
unknown
speaker
the
criterion
is
not
agreement,
and
i
don't
see
why,
in
principle,
the
agreement
should...
when
there
is
an
agreement
following
negotiations,
i
don't
know
why
that
should
in
effect
be
the
touchstone,
or
its
absence
a
demarcating
point.
unknown
speaker
and
prior
to
that
point
there
is
a
unilateral
imposition
by
the
multiemployer
group
of
a
bargaining
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
starr,
i...
why
does
the
conflict
between
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
labor
laws
have
to
rise
to
the
level
of
what
you
call
repugnancy?
i
mean,
it's
not
as
though
the
sherman
act
is
a
clear,
fixed
prescription.
as
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
courts
it's
a
rule
of
reason.
why
isn't
it
enough
that
it
is
a
more
reasonable
disposition,
given
the
labor
laws,
for
a
certain
thing
to
take
place,
rather
than
that
thing
must
be
positively
repugnant
to
the
sherman
act?
unknown
speaker
to
both
statutes,
but
if--
unknown
speaker
--one
statute
simply
says,
unreasonable
restraints
of
trade
are
not
allowed,
why
isn't
it
possible
to
say,
well,
in
the
context
of
labor
negotiations,
what's
reasonable
is
quite
different
from
what's
reasonable
in
other
contexts?
i
mean,
the
sherman
act
is
a
very
mushy
statute.
it's
not
the
kind
of
a
statute
that
establishes
a,
you
know,
a
granite
like
line
which
therefore
is
either
repugnant
or
not
repugnant
to
later
statutes.
unknown
speaker
if
you
can
make
that
nice,
neat
distinction,
but
i
presume
they
also
ultimately
want
some
kind
of
a
contract,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
imposition
of
those
terms
after
the
moment
of
supposed
impasse
is
somehow
categorically
distinguishable
from
the
process
which
i
presume
is
not
necessarily
over.
unknown
speaker
those
were
all
erisa
cases,
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
those
cases
had
nothing
to
do
with
antitrust.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
was
brought
up
at
my
mother's
knee
to
believe
that
antitrust
and
labor
law
do
not
mix,
but
the
very
reason
that
the
nlra
was
passed
was
because
judges
decided
it
was
a
fine
idea,
under
the
antitrust
laws,
to
start
enjoining
trades
unions
and
interfering
with
the
collective
bargaining
process.
so
that's
what
my
two
questions
are.
first,
why
is
this
case
about
organized
sports?
there's
nothing
special
about
them,
is
there?
this
is--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
the
first
question
is...
that
worries
me,
and
if
the
answer
to
this
is
no,
then
that's
the
end
of
that.
unknown
speaker
why
is
this
about
organized
sports
any
more
than
schechter
is
about
chickens?
why
isn't
this
just
a
case
about
multiemployer
bargaining
units
throughout
industry?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
if,
in
fact,
the
antitrust
law
applies
to
the
joint
venture
called
the
national
football
league,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
five
automobile
companies
or
the
95
contractors
that
might
create
a
multiemployer
bargaining
unit.
is
that
your
view?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
you're
saying
there
is
a
distinction.
unknown
speaker
then
if
i
were
to
believe
there
was
not
a
distinction,
and
if
there
is,
then
this
question
is
irrelevant,
but
i'm
not
positive
that
there
is.
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
a
distinction--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
my
second
question
is
this--
unknown
speaker
--that
how
do
you
work
your
exemption
nonexemption?
there's
a
multiemployer
bargaining
union.
there
are
unions.
unknown
speaker
don't
the
employers,
like
the
union,
have
to
decide
among
themselves
what
will
happen
if
they
reach
an
impasse?
don't
they
have
to
talk
to
each
other
about
what
they're
going
to
do--
unknown
speaker
--and
why
isn't
this
all
up
to
the
labor
board,
and
not
up
to
courts?
unknown
speaker
mr.
starr,
i
have
one
short
question,
because
i
know
you
want
to
reserve
your
time.
was
this
subject
of
reserved
players
fairly
comprehended
within
the
scope
of
the
collective
bargaining
discussions?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
it
was
fairly
comprehended
within
the
scope
of
the
discussions?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
starr.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
would
you
tell
us,
please,
why
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
not
included
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
government?
i
guess
you
are
here
just
on
behalf
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--federal
trade
commission.
unknown
speaker
but
it
certainly
isn't
explained.
we
don't
know
what
the
position
might
be.
unknown
speaker
and
i
guess
the
afl
cio
couldn't...
did
they
have
a
vacancy
in
their
boards,
too?
they
haven't
filed
an
amicus
brief
here.
that's
rather
surprising.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace--
unknown
speaker
--before
you
go
on
with
that,
your
time
is
short,
and
there
is
a
question
that
i'd
like
to
put
to
you,
because
the
heart
of
your
argument
is
that
the
impasse
is
the
point
at
which
the
antitrust
laws
come
in,
and
yet
your
brief
was...
admitted
that
that's
a
difficult
time
to
determine.
as
justice
o'connor
asked,
i
thought
that
we
would
be
enlightened
by
the
view
of
the
board
on
that
question,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be...
from
your
own
brief,
it's
very
hard
to
know
what
is
an
impasse.
is
this
temporary?
there
is
a
precedent
of
this
court
that
suggests
that.
when
is
it
really
over?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
concession--
--mr.
wallace,
isn't
it
true,
as
the
respondents
suggest
in
their
brief,
that
the
hope
and
expectation
of
the
labor
laws
is
that
there
is
never
a
complete
impasse,
that
you
go
to
negotiation
for
as
long
as
you
can.
when
you...
it's
proving
fruitless,
each
party
is
left
to
its
means
of
economic
coercion,
and
they
go
to
it,
and
then
eventually
is
it
not
expected...
hoped
and
expected
that
they
will
come
back
to
the
table,
and
the
impasse
will
be
at
an
end?
unknown
speaker
so
why
is
operating
as
a
single
employer
unit
up
until
the
mini
impasse,
okay,
but
between
the
mini
impasse
and
then
during
that
period
until
they
sit
down
to
the
table
again
they
have
to
stop
acting
as
a
single
employer?
unknown
speaker
is
it
require
or
permit,
mr.
wallace?
i
mean,
even
if
the
national
labor
board
act
doesn't
require
it,
it
might
permit
it.
unknown
speaker
suppose
this
proposal--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
this
proposal
had
come
from
the
player's
side
of
the
table,
but
they
wanted,
say,
$3,000
a
week,
and
the
employer
said,
we'll
do
$1,000
a
week,
then
there's
an
impasse,
then
the
employers
impose
the
$1,000
a
week
scheme,
what
result?
unknown
speaker
so
the
fact
that
the
players
themselves
negotiated
it,
or
suggested
it,
is
not
relevant?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
would
that
satisfy
you
if
we
affirmed
the
decision
on
the
different
ground
that
although
there's
no
antitrust
immunity
the
rule
of
reason
in
this
situation
permits
employers
to
continue
to
operate
as
a
single
employer
unit--
unknown
speaker
--between
the
temporary
impasse
and
the
final
settlement
of
the
dispute?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
like
a
distinction
without
a
difference
whether
we
say
that
the
reason
it's
okay
is
because
you're
exempted
from
the
antitrust
laws
or
you're
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
but
the
antitrust
laws
permit
this.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
mr.
wallace,
then,
i
think
your
reasonable--
unknown
speaker
--but
mr.
wallace,
i
think
your
reasonable
defense
might
well
apply
to
a
rule
that
says
only
six
players
on
the
replacement
squad,
or
something
like
that,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
could
say
it's
a
reasonable...
doesn't
violate
the
rule
of
reason
to
fix
the
specific
salary
level.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
suggest
we
could
affirm.
unknown
speaker
you're
just
teasing
us
with
the
notion
that
the
rule
of
reason
might
solve
our
problems.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
levy,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
levy,
i
realize
there's
lots
of
difficulty
determining
when
impasse
occurs
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
but
in
your
view
of
the
law,
does
there
ever
come
a
time
when
the
employers
would
be...
would
not
be
free
to
act
collectively
by
imposing
a
term
such
as
was
imposed
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
when
would
it
come,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
i'm
trying
to
hypothesize
a
case...
i
understand
the
difficulty
of
measuring
impasse,
but
where
everyone
would
agree
that
there's
really
an
impasse
there's
no
point
in
future
bargaining.
could,
at
that
point,
the
employers
continue
to
assert
their
will
in
the
way
they
did
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
in
that
respect
in...
forgetting
professional
sports,
there
are
lots
of
multiemployer
bargaining
units
agreed
to
by
unions.
there's
a
history,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
i've
been
searching,
and
i
can't
find
board
precedent.
i
want
to
know
what
the
labor
board
thinks,
and
so
i
went
in
to
try
to
find
prior
cases.
i
couldn't
find
any.
what
is
the
normal
practice
in...
outside
of
professional
sports?
why
can't
i
find
precedent?
how
do
employers
deal
with
this?
don't
they
normally
say
to
each
other,
what
we'll
do
if
we
reach
an
impasse,
then
don't
they
later
implement
it
as
part
of
a
normal
bargaining
practice?
what
happens
normally
in
labor
law?
there
must
be
some
history
on
it.
why
can't
i
find
it?
unknown
speaker
aside
from
my
own
inabilities.
unknown
speaker
we
know
that,
but
the
issue
would
be,
is
a
decision
by
employers
a)
reached
after
the
impasse
or
b)
reached
prior,
but
implemented
after?
is
that
a
normal
part
of
collective
bargaining
with
a
multiemployer
bargaining
unit?
i
would
look
to
the
board
for
guidance
there.
it's
up
to
them
to
say,
not
up
to
judges,
so
why
can't
i
find
what
happens
normally?
what
does
happen
normally?
unknown
speaker
where?
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
the
problem
i
have
is,
does
the
bargaining
process
ever
come
to
an
end,
because
i
think
you
seem
to
agree
that
if
it
had
come
to
an
end,
then
the
antitrust
laws
would
kick
in.
unknown
speaker
it
never
comes
to
an
end.
unknown
speaker
so
basically
what
you're
saying
is
there
is
an
industrywide
understanding
that
you
never
have
impasse.
unknown
speaker
ah.
unknown
speaker
see,
all
the
other
cases
are
before
impasse.
that's
why
this
one's--
unknown
speaker
--there's
really
no
such
thing
as
a
real
impasse,
then.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
could
be
one
that
would
justify
decertification
of
the
union.
unknown
speaker
but
what
would
it
take...
something
like
that
is
what
it
would
take
for
the
antitrust
laws
to
kick
in.
that's
the
point
that
i
think
you
were
referring
to
earlier.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
new
concept,
good
faith
decertification.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
in
this
respect
you
are
agreeing,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
totally
with
judge
edwards
on
that,
it
ends
when
the
union
decertifies
so
that
there's
no
more
bargaining
regime.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
position
requires
you
basically
to
put
the
employees
to
a
choice
between
preserving
unionization
or
exercising
their
rights
under
the
sherman
act.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
very
much
like
it--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
say
it
doesn't
end
until
decertification,
so--
unknown
speaker
--the
employees
can
make
that
choice?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
at
impasse?
unknown
speaker
so
at
that
point
they
are
put
to
the
choice,
stick
with
unionization
or
exercise
rights
under
the
sherman
act,
one
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
does
that
penalize
them
in
some
sense
under
the
national
labor
relations
act?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we've
been
very
protective
of
employee
rights--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
labor
act,
and
does
that
kind
of
a
choice
in
effect
amount
to
a
penalty?
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
a
way
legally
to
bring
the
board
into
the
making
of
this
decision?
that
is,
is
it
possible
that
if
the
board
were
to
say,
for
example,
that
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
group
of
employers
to
impose
terms
for
the
reason
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
in
this
instance,
since
many
months
ago
they
reached
impasse,
at
that
point
the
antitrust
laws
would
kick
in?
what
i'm
looking
for
is,
is
there
a
way
to
turn
justice
stevens'
question
about
when
you
reach
impasse,
a
real
one
so
that
collective
bargaining's
out
of
it,
is
there
a
way
legally
to
bring
the
board
into
the
making
of
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
be?
unknown
speaker
how
could
you
do
that?
what
would
be
the
legal
route?
unknown
speaker
contending
what?
yes--
--contending
what?
unknown
speaker
does
the
board
have
the
right...
i'm
unfamiliar
with
this.
does
the
board
have
the
right
to
determine
the
fairness
of
a
proposal?
unknown
speaker
and
what
would
the
standard
be?
how
would
they
judge
something
like...
this
is
a
new
one
on
me.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
one
of
your
concerns
is
that
if
the
petitioners
prevail,
then
there
will
be
an
incentive,
or
an
inducement
to
reach
impasse
on
the
part
of
the
labor
parties
so
that
they
can
bring
antitrust
remedies.
unknown
speaker
did
the
board
address
that
in
other
contexts,
other
than
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith?
in
other
words,
has
the
board
told
us
that
it
has
concerns
with
mechanisms
that
might
lead
to
early
impasse?
unknown
speaker
other
than
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levy,
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
views
of
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
antitrust
division
and
the
rather
obscure
view
of
the
labor
board
on
this
matter?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
make
a
request
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
give
me
a
better
answer
than
that.
your
only
answer
is,
we
don't
owe
them
deference
because
they
didn't
make
a
request
for
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
it
up
to
the
board,
very
much,
since
the
implied
exemption
grows
out
of
the
interpretation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
enacted
against
a
background
of
the
sherman
act.
unknown
speaker
it
has
made
clear
that
it
disagrees
with
the
judgment
below.
unknown
speaker
well,
for
one
thing,
we
don't
have
any
agency
ruling,
we
don't
have
any
agency
adjudication,
and
we
have
the
agency
coming
in,
at
least
one
agency,
and
telling
us
how
it
thinks
we
ought
to
decide
the
case,
but
i
didn't
know
that
we
applied
chevron
deference
to
positions
that
are
just
taken
in
briefs.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another
question,
mr.
levy?
this
is
really
a
tricky
case.
is
there
any
other
case
to
which
you
can
call
my
attention
in
which
an
implied
labor
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
has
been
recognized
when
there
was
no
agreement
between
a
labor
union
and
management?
unknown
speaker
when
that
which
is
sought
to
be
exempt
is
not
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
in
jewel
tea
it
was
an
agreement,
and--
unknown
speaker
--no
cases
from
this
court,
though.
unknown
speaker
you
see,
one
reason
it
occurs
to
me
the
agreement
might
be
a
touchstone,
and
i'm
by
no
means
at
rest
on
this,
is
that
the
sherman
act
focuses
its
attention
on
agreements,
and
when
you
talk
about
processes,
i
think
well,
maybe
there's
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act
at
all
when
you're
just
negotiating
the
processes.
the
thing
that
the
sherman
act
always
looks
at
is
there
an
agreement
in
restraint
of
trade,
and
the
exemption
says,
well,
this
category
of
agreements
is
not
covered
by
the
sherman
act.
now,
i'm
a
little
unclear
why
we
don't
have
any
category
of
agreements
to
which
labor
is
not
a
party
that
are
somehow
brought
within
a
labor
exemption
for
labor...
you
know,
the
labor
union
exemption,
which
up
to
now
has
focused
on
agreements--
unknown
speaker
--which
labor
is
a
party.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
an
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
employees
necessitates
a
subagreement
among
the
employers.
that
is,
they
agree
among
themselves
to
come
up
with
a
particular
offer.
unknown
speaker
and
they
agree
among
themselves
to
bargain
collectively,
as
a
unit.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
agreement
wouldn't
violate
the
sherman
act.
just
agreeing
on
how
you
go
into
a
bargain
wouldn't...
that
wouldn't
violate
the
sherman
act.
you
could
subject
to
antitrust
scrutiny
and
not
have
any
problem.
it
would
be
if
they
all
said,
no
matter
what
happens
we're
not
going
to
pay
these
guys
any
more
than
$1,000
a
week,
forever
and
ever
and
ever.
that
would
violate
the
sherman
act.
unknown
speaker
but
going
back
to
the
case
in
which
there
has
been
no
consent
to
multiemployer
bargaining,
and
the
employers
all
agree
that
they
will
come
up
with
a
uniform
set
of
terms,
that's
subject
to
the
sherman
act.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
levy,
here
i
understood
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
preserved
the
right
of
individual
players
to
negotiate
their
own
terms,
their
own
salaries.
unknown
speaker
so
how
can
you
say
there's
only
one
seller
of
services?
every
player
except
this
one
group
involved
in
this
case
are
individual
sellers.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
as
to
the
market
as
a
whole
you
can't
say
there's
only
one
seller.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
a
lot
of
them
had
their
own
agents.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
what
would
a
slow
down
be
in
a
football
game?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
levy.
mr.
starr,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
starr,
before
you...
i
have
a
very
quick
question.
i
won't
take
much
of
your
time.
if,
as
you
say,
the
employers
cannot
continue
to
bargain
as
a
unit
once
there's
been
impasse,
and
each
one
has
to
bargain
on
his
own,
are
they...
is
each
one,
in
bargaining
on
his
own,
limited
to
the
last
offer
that
had
been
made
in
the
bargaining
process?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand,
but
presumably
each
individual
employer
can
then
impose
his
own
terms.
unknown
speaker
now,
may
those
terms--
unknown
speaker
--must
those
terms
be
the
terms
that
had
been
bargained
collectively?
can
they
only
impose--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
the
real
remedy
absent
a
charge
before
the
board.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
