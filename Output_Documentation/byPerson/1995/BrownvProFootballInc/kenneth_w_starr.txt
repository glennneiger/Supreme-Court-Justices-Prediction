mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
before
the
court
an
important
question
under
the
implied
labor
exemption
to
the
antitrust
laws.
at
issue
is
the
legality
of
unilateral
action
in
the
labor
market
taken
by
the
28
clubs
of
the
national
football
league
which
enjoy
monopsony
power.
using
the
considerable
enforcement
authority
of
the
commissioner
of
the
league,
the
clubs
unilaterally
imposed
a
drastic
salary
restraint
by
eliminating
competition
for
a
small
minority
of
the
1,600
players
of
the
national
football
league.
specifically,
the
restraint
fixed
the
compensation
of
developmental
squad
players
at
a
parsimonious
$16,000
for
the
regular
season
in
1989.
the
court
below,
reversing
judge
lamberth,
shielded
the
nfl
clubs
from
antitrust
scrutiny.
the
court
found
a
complete
repugnancy
between
antitrust
and
collective
bargaining,
and
in
the
process
gave
professional
sports
leagues
virtually
the
same
exemption
from
antitrust
scrutiny
that
only
baseball
had
previously
enjoyed,
and
that
congress
has
never
seen
fit
to
grant,
and
congress
knows
full
well
how
to
create
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
laws,
as
it
did
so
explicitly
in
the
statutory
labor
exemption.
for
three
reasons,
we
submit
respectfully
the
result
below
should
not
stand.
first
and
foremost,
our
primary
submission,
there
is
no
clear
conflict.
there
is
no
repugnancy
between
antitrust
and
labor
policy
in
this
particular
setting
of
a
competitive
labor
market.
to
the
contrary.
for
many
years,
from
this
court's
decision
in
radovich
through
the
seminal
case
of
mackey
v.
the
national
football
league
and
then
beyond,
mccourt
from
the
sixth
circuit,
applying
the
mackey
analysis
for
professional
hockey,
the
sports
world,
albeit
subject
to
antitrust
scrutiny
with
respect
to
restraints
in
the
labor
market--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
your
honor,
it's
an
eighth
circuit
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
court
has
not
had
occasion
to
address
this
issue.
there
have
been,
your
honor,
a
number...
mr.
chief
justice,
a
number
of
lower
court
decisions.
mackey,
the
eighth
circuit
decision,
articulated
what
was
for
many
years
the
subtle
standard
and
applied
in
a
wide
variety
of
cases,
and
as
a
result,
the
sports
world,
although
it
was
subject
to
antitrust
scrutiny
with
respect
to
restraints
in
the
labor
market,
enjoyed
labor
peace
and
a
moderation
of
what
would
otherwise
have
been
very
extreme
and
rigid
restraints
and
limitations
on
employee
freedom,
the
economic
freedom
of
players,
which
is
ultimately
what
is
at
stake.
not
only
is
history
and
practical
experience
reflected
by
the
30
years
of
antitrust
history,
not
only
is
history
and
practical
experience
a
sure
guide
to
the
court
in
its
decision
here
today,
but
so,
too,
is
basic
theory.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
from
radovich,
then
mackey
was
decided
in
the
1970's,
and
then
after
mackey
a
large
number
of
decisions
in
various
industries,
your
honor,
including
professional
basketball.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
until
1989.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
1950's.
this
court
recognized
the
implied
labor
exemption
in
a
series
of
cases
in
the
1960's.
antitrust
scrutiny
had
been
traditionally
applied,
other
than
to
baseball...
this
court's
historic
decision
in
baseball
had
historically
been
applied.
after
this
court
articulated
the
implied
labor
exemption,
numerous
courts,
led,
first,
by
the
eighth
circuit,
which
was
the
first
circuit
to
address
this
extensively
in
the
1970's,
in
the
mackey
case,
invalidated
the
rozelle
rule.
the
rozelle
rule
was
challenged
by
players
who
were
tied
to
the
team
under
the
reserve
clause
the
rozelle
rule,
tied
to
the
team
for
which
they
were
playing
which
had
drafted
them
for
the
entirety
of
their
careers.
the
eighth
circuit
said,
we
apply
a
rule
of
reason
analysis.
there
is
no
exemption
from
antitrust
scrutiny.
and
why
is
that?
what
is
it
that
makes
professional
sports
different
than
the
other
conventional
industries
that
have
shared
with
the
court
concerns
that
to
adopt
the
rule
that
has
been
embraced,
now,
for
many,
many
years,
until
powell
and
then
recent
decisions
including--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
was
a
division
of
opinion,
but
the
eighth
circuit
as
a
whole
still
concluded...
and,
in
fact,
we
would
still
win,
your
honor,
under
the
powell
analysis
for
this
reason.
powell
still
applied
mackey
to
say,
for
there
to
be
an
implied
labor
exemption
there
must
have
been
an
agreed
to
term.
the
employees
and
management
must
have
agreed.
that
is
pivotal.
that
is
the
core
of
the
implied
labor
exemption.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
because
the
test,
your
honor,
and
this
is
our
basic
submission,
is
repugnancy.
is
there
repugnancy
for
the
antitrust
laws
to
apply?
under
circumstances
where
employers
are
coming
together
to
determine,
what
are
our
proposals
going
to
be
to
the
players
association
and
the
like,
formulating
those
proposals
and
the
like,
are,
i
believe,
protected
by
the
implied
labor
exemption,
which
does
what?
it
is,
at
its
core,
protecting
the
ability
of
employees
through
their
labor
organization
to
come
together
with
employers
through
collective
bargaining
to
reach
an
agreement.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
agreement
is
not,
standing
alone,
the
touchstone
by
any
means.
in
fact,
let
me
be
clear
about
what
the
touchstone
is.
we
think
that
by
virtue
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act,
two
laws
passed
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
the
issue
is,
is
there
repugnancy
to
applying
the
antitrust
laws
to
this
particular
setting?
we
know
that
there
is
not.
we
know
it
from
practical
experience,
but
we
also
know
that
the
other
side's
essential
submission
is,
well,
you
see,
if
you
allow
antitrust
scrutiny,
that
will
end
multiemployer
bargaining,
and
we
know
that
not
to
be
true.
and
in
particular,
what
is
the
situation
here?
this
is
the
unilateral
imposition
of
terms
of
employment
by
the
employer
cartel.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and,
your
honor,
we
think
that
is
inherently
part
and
parcel
of
the
collective
bargaining
process,
which
unilateral
implementation
of
terms
is
not.
that's
the
distinction,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
basic
principles
of
statutory
construction,
that
the
court
is
under
a
duty
to
interpret
the
law
so
as
to
give
full
rein
to
both
those--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--to
both
statutes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
your
honor,
the
theory,
it
seems
to
me
is,
is
there
antitrust
immunity?
are
you
immune
from
the
entire
scrutiny
that
you
have
just
described
as
opposed
to,
must
you
at
least
be
subjected
to
the
restraining,
constraining
influences
of
the
antitrust
laws?
the
question
is
immunity.
what
they
are
seeking
is
immunity
with
respect
to
what?
not
bargaining
positions.
they're
seeking
immunity
with
respect
to
the
implementation
of
terms,
which
is
the
substantive--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
this
court
has
already
charted
the
path
in
that
very
respect
in
fort
halifax.
it
has
said
the
unilateral
implementation
of
terms
is,
in
fact,
quite
a
different
kettle
of
fish
than,
and
does
not,
in
fact,
intrude
upon
the
collective
bargaining
process.
a
trilogy
of
cases
that
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side
love
to
ignore,
metropolitan
life,
fort
halifax,
and
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
livadas,
speak
in
terms
of
the
collective--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
your
honor.
livadas
was,
in
fact,
a...
there
were
two
issues
involved
in
metropolitan
life,
and
fort
halifax,
and
among
the
issues...
and
this
court
addressed
the
national
labor
relations
act
implied
preemption
issue
with
respect
to
all.
and,
indeed,
in
livadas,
your
honor,
the
key
point
made
there
was
that
as
a
matter
of
national
labor
relations
policy
and
giving
meaning
to
section
7's
right
on
the
part
of
employees
to
organize,
that
they
should
not
be
put
to
what,
this
court's
felicitous
language,
the
unappetizing
choice
of
choosing
to
associate
together,
to
bargain,
on
the
one
hand,
versus
giving
up
substantive
rights
given
to
them
by
law.
now,
what
is
that
body
of
law?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--because
of
the
critical
structure
and
nature
of
the
sports
industry,
which
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--which
is...
which
is...
comma,
which
is,
competition
in
the
labor
market.
player
associations,
in
contrast
to
unions
in
conventional
industries
exist
for
the
very
purpose
of
preserving
competition
that
the
employers
would
like
to
eliminate.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
my
view
is
there's
implied
labor
exemption
that
the
conventional
industries
can
say
exist
because
of
what,
unions
in
those
conventional
industries
have
joined
together
for
the
very
purpose
of
eliminating
competition
in
the
labor
market.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
clearly--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
if--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
if
i
may--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
refer
the
court
to
mr.
levy's
opposition
to
certiorari.
he
put
a
roman
numeral
here,
and
it's
called
roman
numeral
iii,
and
he
said,
this
doesn't
apply
outside
sports.
sports
is
unique.
why?
because
of
competition.
i
would
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
employers
associations--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
first
of
all,
what
we
are
again
talking
about
is
not
the
process
that
justice
souter
was
referring
to
as
well
in
terms
of
the
formulation
of
positions
and
the
like.
i
believe
that
that
is
exempted
by
the
implied
labor
exemption.
why?
because
there
would
be
a
clear
repugnancy
to
insert
antitrust
laws
into
that
setting,
not
with
respect
to
the
unilateral
imposition
of
terms,
which
is
a
substitute
for
a
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
well...
oh,
fairly
comprehended
within,
there
was
bargaining
to
impasse
what
was...
there
was
never
agreement.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
we--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--your
honor,
the
premise
is
incorrect.
our
premise
is
not
that
there
cannot
be
bargaining
after
impasse.
what
there
cannot
be
is
the
unilateral
implementation
of
terms
as
substituted,
if
i
may,
enforced
by
the
cartel.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
an
individual
employer--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
a
substantive
issue
under
labor
law
that
does
not
admit
of
a
ready
answer.
that
is
to
say,
it
may
be
that
if
you
depart
from
that
last
term,
and
you
unilaterally
impose...
it's
complicated,
your
honor,
but
i'm
being
very
brief
on
this.
that
is,
if
you
depart
from
your
last
offer
that
may...
may...
be
evidence
of
bad
faith
bargaining
on
the
part
of
the...
but
if
i
may,
what
is
at
issue...
i
have
about
2
minutes.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
this
stark
choice
that
has
been...
that
i
think
justice
o'connor
has
captured,
an
unappetizing
choice
that
i
think
mr.
levy
has
been
very
clear
about,
that
the
real
remedy
is,
in
fact,
to
decertify,
and
that
is
a
stark
choice
that
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
its
backdrop
posit...
backdrop
opinions,
metropolitan
life,
fort
halifax,
and
livadas.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
that
is
a
real...
the
broad
point
that
i
think
those
cases
stand
for,
your
honor,
and
i
cite
the
court's
language
in
fort
halifax
that
both
employers
and
employees
come
to
the
bargaining
table
with
a
backdrop,
and
that
is
to
say
that
this
does
not
repeal
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
does
not
repeal
osha
and
the
like.
those
are
backdrop
rights
that
the
parties
can
bargain
about,
but
fort
halifax
makes
it
enormously
clear
that
there
is,
in
fact,
an
ability
on
the
part
of
an
employee,
a
union,
to
in
fact
invoke
those
backdrop
rights,
and
that
is
a
very
critical
part
of
the
understanding
of
the
structure
of
the
labor
laws.
and,
in
fact,
in
terms
of
national
labor
policy,
let
us
remember
what
this
case
is
about:
an
effort
to
secure
an
implied
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
when...
and
i
don't
think
this
is
obscure
at
all...
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
concluded
that
this
is
wrong.
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
may
do
serious
harm
to
labor
policy,
and
why
is
that
the
stark
choice.
i
thank
the
court.
