justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
with
respect
to
that,
suppose
this
case
had
developed
that
judge
pratt's
acceptance
of
the
government's
contractor
defense
had
stuck,
that
there
had
been
no
change
of
district
judges,
and
he
had
entered
that
judgment,
an
appeal
is
taken,
and
the
companies
are
concerned
about
how
the
court
of
appeals
would
resolve
the
government
contractor
defense,
so
they
settle,
precisely
the
terms
that
we
have
before
us
here.
they
settle,
and
then
they
want
to
be
reimbursed
by
the
government
for
the
cost
of
that
settlement.
would
they
have
a
claim
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
loss
in
what
i've
described
to
you
is
their
decision,
their
uncertainty
whether
their
victory
in
the
district
court
will
prevail.
that's...
they
don't
want
to
take
a
chance
on
losing
on
appeal.
they've
won
in
the
district
court,
and
yet
you
say
that
the
government
would
be
responsible
under
the
contract.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
law
is
as
a
government
contractor
you
have
a
complete
defense
to
the
tort
action,
if
that's
what
the
law
is,
and
then
the
manufacturers
say,
yes,
we
urge
that
that
was
the
law,
it
was
accepted
by
the
court
that
that
was
the
law,
but
we
know
those
courts
of
appeals
are
not
reliable,
so
we're
going
to
settle
rather
than
risk
a
reversal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
between
the
parties
have
you
got
any
case
in
the
spearin
line
where,
not
the
parties
to
the
immediate
contract
was
involved,
but
where
spearin
was
successfully
invoked
to
recover
money
paid
to
third
party
tort
claimants,
as
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
they
third
party
tort
claimants?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
have
built...
in
setting
the
price
of
this
contract,
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
and
justice
breyer
were
asking
about
before,
you're
compelled
to
make
the
contract
with
the
government,
but
could
you
have
put
in
as
a
cost
the
cost
of
insuring
against
potential
tort
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
i...
i
take
it
that
you
have
candidly
answered
the
question,
could
the
manufacturers
have
negotiated
for
a
provision
that
said,
defendant
indemnify,
your
answer
says
yes,
they
could
have
asked
but
we
wouldn't
have
given.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how--
--the
question
was
at
the
time
of
the
contract,
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if...
the
government
could
have
said,
we
won't
give
you
that
term,
and
you
still
have
to
do
the
contract,
which
the
law
says--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
can
compel
you.
what
about
the...
if
they
had
said,
okay,
we're
going
to
put
into
the
price
what
it
will
cost
us
to
insure
against
this
potential
tort
liability.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
about
the
government
contractor
defense,
would
you
please
remind
me
of
how
that
played
out?
judge
pratt
said,
i
accept
that
defense,
and
then
there
were
some
proceedings
before
judge
weinstein
where
i
understand
the
government
didn't
simply
stand
aside,
but
it
argued
affirmatively
against
the
government
contractor
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
phillips,
that
argument,
if
this
were
a
court
of
error
correction,
if
this
were
a
court
of
appeals
and
errors,
that
might
be
a
very
sympathetic
argument,
but
in
terms
of
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari,
the
law
that
we
are
making
not
for
this
peculiar
case,
but
for
the
class
of
cases,
how
does
that--
