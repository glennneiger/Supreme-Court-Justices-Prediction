we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94
818,
hercules,
incorporated
v.
united
states.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
it's
been
established
for
a
long
time,
mr.
phillips,
that
he
who
deals
with
the
government
must
turn
square
corners.
that
is,
it's
not
a
matter
of
equity,
or
something
like
that,
it's
a
matter
of
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
is
always
strictly
construed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
read
spearin
to
say
that
the
law
of
implied
warranties
is...
or
indemnity
is
just
going
to
be
incorporated
bag
and
baggage
into
every
deal
with
the
united
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
spearin
is
a
fairly
limited
case
on
its
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
another
result
which
is...
you
know,
you
can
say
the...
or,
it's
quite
different,
because
ordinarily,
in
any
sort
of
litigation,
to
recover
attorney's
fees
against
the
government
there
has
to
be
an
express
statutory
provision
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
picture,
it
seems
to
me,
just
as
justice
scalia
says
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
picture
when
you're
saying
the
government
doesn't
indemnify
people
wrongly
prosecuted
under
criminal
law.
you
may
have
a
different
theory
that
can
be
distinguished,
but
it
fits
in
oddly
with
the
way
the
government
treats
a
lot
of
other
people.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
provision
is
that
you're
relying
on,
mr.
dumont?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
government
ordinarily
come
in
when
a
contractor
is
raising
a
government
contractor
defense
in
every
court
that
he
might
raise
it
and
say,
we
support
this
defense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
