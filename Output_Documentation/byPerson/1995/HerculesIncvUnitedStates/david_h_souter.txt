justice
david
h.
souter
did
you
allege
that
you
had
been
compelled
within
the
meaning
of
section
101,
that
you
had
been
compelled
to
produce
this
stuff?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
we
get
into
indemnification
when
you
had
a
defense
under
707
by
virtue
of
the
compulsion?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
leaving
aside
whatever
under
other
circumstances
might
or
might
not
be
implied,
doesn't
your
allegation,
if
it
is
accepted,
entitle
you
to
a
defense
and,
therefore,
why
should
we
get
into
implying
indemnification
that
you
don't
need?
justice
david
h.
souter
should
you
be
excused
from
litigating
your
position
on
that?
in
other
words,
i
don't
know
how
that
will
ultimately
play
out,
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
strong
argument.
should
we
excuse
you
for
carrying
that
issue
as
far
as
you
can,
and
go
to
the
convenience
of
implying
this
indemnification
so
that
you
don't
have
to
bother
to
litigate
your
707
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
a
convenience
or
not,
if,
to
the
extent
that
we
are
going
to
do
any
implying
here,
or
find
an
implication,
why
should
we
find
an
implication
when,
on
your
own
allegations,
you
have
a
defense
under
707
and,
secondly,
why
shouldn't
you
have
to
litigate
that
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
may
be
reasonable,
but
if
we
have
to
choose
between
allowing
you
to
blink
at
the
expense
of
an
indemnification
which,
in
fact,
may
not
be
necessary,
or
may
not
have
proven
to
be
necessary
even
on
your
own
theory
had
you
pursued
your
defense,
why
should
we
prefer
you
to
the
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
my
difficulty
is,
your
argument
seems
to
be
proving,
if
i
accept
it,
that
you
do
have
a
defense
under
707
and
the
question
is,
who
should
be,
in
effect,
relieved
from
establishing
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
by
the
same
token...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this,
but
did
you
request
the
government
to
take
part
in
the
settlement?
did
you
request
the
government
to
take
a
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
your
view--
--does
that
argue
against
the...
the
theory
that
this
is
somehow
implied
in
fact,
do
you
concede
that
if
you
get
what
you
want
the
basis
upon
which
you
get
it
is
going
to
be
totally
divorced
from
any
concept
of
implied
in
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
certainly
not
based
upon
any
theory--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
assumes
that,
in
fact,
this
was
implicit
in
the
agreement
that
they
actually
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
that
general
rule,
taking
it
on
its
face,
plausible
in
the
very
case
that
you
are
arguing
in
which
you
are
acting
under
compulsion?
the...
whatever
plausibility
that
may
have,
whatever
justifiability
that
may
have
as
a
general
rule,
i
suppose
is
premised
on
the
assumption
that
you
have
two
parties
who
are
capable
of
deciding
whether
or
not...
each
of
them
are
capable
of
deciding
whether
or
not
to
deal
with
the
other,
and
yet
the
very
premise
of
your
argument
and
of
your
claim
here
is
that
you
do
not
have
that
option,
and
hence
it
raises
the
question
why
these
plausible
implications
in
other
circumstances
should
be
imported
into
this
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
do
concede,
i
take
it,
then,
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
limiting
your...
the
government's
authority
to
compel
under
101
merely
to
compel
priority
of
performance
as
opposed
to
performance,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
guess
i
wasn't
paying
attention
a
moment
ago.
you're
saying
now
that
the
defense
under
707
is
narrower
than
the
scope
of
the
compulsion
under
101,
but
the
slack
is
made,
the
difference
is
made
up
by
the
government
contractor
defense,
so
that
if
you
combine
707
and
the
government
contractor
defense,
there
will
be
a
complete
defense
to
whatever
was
compelled
under
101,
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
explain
it
to
me
again,
then,
because
i
guess
i'm--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
not
everything
that
is
compelled
will
be
subject
to
that
shield.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
what
about
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
there
need
be
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
tough
world,
and
that's
the
way
it
goes.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
is
at
least
a
partial
gapfiller,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
government
contractor
defense.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
may
not
be
a
complete
gapfiller.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
one
reason
why
it
is
not
is
that
the
conditions
for
applying
707
and
the
conditions
for
government
contractor
defense
are
not
the
same.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
might...
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
now...
well,
no,
never
mind.
