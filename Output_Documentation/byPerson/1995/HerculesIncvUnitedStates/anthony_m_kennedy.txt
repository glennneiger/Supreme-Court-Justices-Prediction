mr.
phillips,
how
does
the
defense
production
act
work?
suppose
you
were
ordered
to
produce
this.
could
you
say,
well,
we'll
negotiate
the
contract.
now,
we
want
an
indemnity
clause
in
the
contract.
did
you
have
that
option,
that
choice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
does
the
government
have
to
give
it
to
you?
i
mean,
how
does
this
work?
if
they're
making
you
do
something--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
can
they
force
you
to
proceed
then
anyway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
other
question.
did
you
ever
allege
at
any
point
that
there
was
a
taking,
or
you
think
that
this
doesn't
arise
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position...
i
take
it
it's
the
government's
position
that
if
a
high
official
in
the
government,
say
the
attorney
general,
had
looked
at
this
litigation
and
said,
this
is
terribly
unfair
to
thompson
and
hercules,
go
in
and
help
them
out,
that
you
would
have
had
really...
you
would
have
told
the
attorney
general,
look,
we
have
no
discretion,
no
authority
to
do
that?
would
you
have
had
any
discretion
to
alleviate
hercules'
concern,
hercules'
plight?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
would
be
about
as
far
as
you
could
go,
in
your
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
view
is
that
the
most
you
could
have
done
was
to
have
supported
them
with
the
government
contractor
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
have
the
authority
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
your
position
is
the
only
thing
you
could
have
done
that
you
didn't
do
was
to
file
a
helpful
brief.
