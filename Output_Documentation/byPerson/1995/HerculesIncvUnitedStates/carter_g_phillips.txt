mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
is
a
case
about
simple
fairness.
the
petitioners
were
compelled
under
the
threat
of
civil
and
criminal
penalties
to
produce
agent
orange.
they
were
required
to
produce
it
according
to
precise
specifications
commanded
by
the
united
states
government.
the
specifications
ensured
that
dioxin
would
be
produced,
which
the
united
states
knew,
and
the
government
also
knew,
and
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
found
that
dioxin
is
an
extremely
hazardous
substance.
petitioners
knew
none
of
these
facts,
and
the
united
states
knew
them
and
declined
to
divulge
any
of
that
information
to
the
united
states...
or,
excuse
me,
to
the
petitioner.
the
agent
orange
that
was
produced
by
the
petitioners
was
done
so
in
strict
conformity
to
the
requirements
of
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states
then
used
it
in
unheard
of
concentrations
and
exposed
thousands
of
american
military
and
others
to
the
risks
that
arise
from
the
dioxin.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
who
cannot
recover
against
the
united
states?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
i
think
it's
a
question
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
at
least
some
portion
of
the
injured
parties,
of
course,
are
taken
care
of
by
veterans
benefits
programs,
and
that
was
a
decision
the
court
made
a
long
time
ago
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the...
as
i
understand
the
theory,
justice
scalia,
the
quid
pro
quo
for
depriving
soldiers
of
the
ability
to
go
against
the
united
states
on
a
tort
theory
was
because
they
have
other
remedies,
and
therefore
the
court
interpreted
the
tort
claims
act
not
to
prove...
not
to
allow
recovery.
that
says
nothing,
though,
about
what
ought
to
be
the
relationship
between
the
contractors
and
the
united
states.
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
in
defining
that
relationship
you
have
to
look
to
the
basic
law
of...
the
basic
federal
common
law,
and
what
rules
make
sense
there.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
but
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
there's
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
lodgings
that
were
filed
with
the
court
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
contract.
the
tucker
act
expressly
waives
sovereign
immunity
for
all
contract
claims.
we're
simply
trying
to
ascertain
the
broad
outlines
of
what's
within
those
contracts
based
on
principles
this
court
has
long
followed
in
terms
of
when
do
you
imply
either
indemnification
agreements
or
warranties
based
on
the
relationship
between
the
parties
and
the
course
of
conduct
between
the
parties.
the
litigation
in
this
particular
case
arose
in
the
wake
of
the
initial
settlements
that
were
done
by
the
petitioners
after
they
were
sued
by
the...
those
who
had
been
exposed
to
agent
orange.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
they
would
have
a
claim.
they
would
unquestionably
have
a
claim
under
an
implied
indemnification
theory,
because
it
is
well
settled
under
standard
contract
rules
that
if
you
are
indemnified
against
losses,
that
whatever
losses
arise
out
of
your
course
of
conduct,
assuming
you're
an
innocent
party,
are
recoverable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor,
under
an
implied
indemnification,
which
is
either
a
variant
of
spearin,
or
a
concept
that
you
ought
to
take
directly
from
ryan
stevedoring,
where
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties
demonstrates
the
kind
of
control
that
we're
talking
about
here,
where
you
have
compelled
production,
you
have
precise
specifications,
and
you
have
superior
knowledge.
in
that
situation,
you
would
ordinarily...
in
an
ordinary
agency
relationship
you
would
immediately
assume
indemnification,
and
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
i
understand
the
standard
rules
of
damages
in
an
indemnification
arrangement,
the
fact
that
you
had
to
expend
moneys
under
any
circumstances
is
recoverable
against
the
indemnitor.
now,
the
question
is,
were
the
expenditures
reasonable?
that
is,
has
the
indemnitee
in
some
sense
squandered
the
assets
of
the
indemnitor?
now,
in
your
hypothetical,
you
could
argue
that
you're
getting
close
to
that,
because
in
some
situation
where
you
have
an
absolute
slam
dunk
winner,
it
may
be
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
settle.
in
the
facts
of
our
case,
obviously,
that's
not
what
we
faced.
we
didn't
have
a
guaranteed
defense,
and
we
weren't
even
being
supported
by
the
united
states
as
part
of
that
process.
the
other
portion
of
why
an
indemnification
fits
neatly
into
this
whole
arrangement
is
that
under
standard
indemnification
law
the
government
would,
as
an
indemnitor,
be
in
a
position
to
step
into
the
shoes
of
the
indemnitee
and
therefore
take
over
the
defense,
and
if,
under
those
circumstances
the
government
wanted
to
ensure
1)
that
no
settlements
would
go
forward
that
they
hadn't
approved
of,
they
could
exercise
that
right,
but
they
would
have
to
take
over
the
defense
under
those
circumstances.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
just
standard
indemnification
law
as
it
would
apply
in
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
now,
with
respect
to
breach
of
warranty,
the
issue
is
a
little
less
clear
because
the
causation
requirement
between
a
breach
of
warranty
and
the
particular
damages
is
less
clearly
supported
by
the
position
that
you're
entitled
not
only
to
recover
anything
that
you
spend
in
consequence
of
a
judgment,
but
that
you're
also
entitled
to
any
settlement
that
you
reasonably
enter
into.
i
think
part
of
the
reason
why
it's
less
clear
is
because
you
don't
have
the
indemnitor
there
to
protect
itself,
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
courts
take,
i
think,
a
much
harder
look
at
whether
or
not
the
particular
damages
were
caused
by
the
particular
breach.
but
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
of
summary
judgment,
and
we've
not
had
an
opportunity
to
prove
any
of
those
relationships
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
and
i'm
confident
that
if
we
get
back
to
the
claims
court
and
we
can
demonstrate
that
the
specifications
create
both
breaches
of
warranty
and
breaches...
and
that
the...
and
indemnification
rights,
we'll
be
able
to
demonstrate
under
the
traditional
common
law
rules
that
otherwise
would
apply
precisely
how
the
damages
ought
to
flow.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
we
did
allege
that
we
had
been
compelled
to
produce
under...
that
there
were
orders
entered
under
section
707
of
the
defense
production--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean
we
argued
that
we--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i've
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
we
tried
that
defense
and
it
didn't
succeed.
we
asserted
in
the
agent
orange
litigation
that
we
should
not
be
held
liable,
that
we
should
be
held
harmless,
as
the
provisions
seemed
to
indicate,
and
were
told
that
it
only
swept
to
the
extent
of
the
priority,
and
protections
against
the
priority
of
contracts,
not
from
the
rest
of
the
damages
that
would
flow
from
performance
of
the
particular
contract,
so
it
may--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--let
me
step
back
for
a
second
in
terms
of
the
sort
of
convenience
of
an
indemnification,
because
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
that's
not
a
matter
of
convenience,
it's
a
matter
of
the
basic
way
of
interpreting
the
relationship
between
the
parties
under
these
particular
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
did
litigate
that
point
up
to
the
stage
where
we
faced
a
40
billion
claim,
and
at
that
point
we
blinked.
i
think
that
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
litigating
judgment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
the
basic
reason
is
that
the
government
contractor
whose
entire
enterprise
is
controlled
exclusively
by
the
united
states
is
an
innocent
party
to
this
entire
proceeding,
and
as
between
an
innocent
party
and
a
not
innocent
party
in
an
implied
indemnification
arrangement,
it's
hornbook
law
that
you
favor
the
innocent
party.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
know,
the
other
side
of
that
is
that
when
we
argued
this,
the
united
states
did
not
come
in
and
argue
that
we
were
entitled
to
protection
under
section
707.
they
didn't
view
that
as
a
defense.
we've
never
been...
never
got
the
benefit
of
the
government
supporting
our
particular
position.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
absolutely.
from
day
1
we
sought
the
government's
assistance
throughout
this
litigation,
and
failed
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
that's
standard
indemnification
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
understand
that,
justice
scalia,
but
those
people
also
don't
have
a
contractual
relationship
with
the
federal
government.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
i
mean,
under
ordinary
indemnification
rules,
justice
scalia,
the
party
who
has
the
power
to
compel,
the
party
who
has
the
power
to
require
compliance,
and
the
party
who
has
superior
knowledge
and
who
allows
the
innocent
contractor
to
engage
those
kinds
of
expenses
is
entitled
to
be
indemnified.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
let
me
suggest
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
essentially
it
seems
to
me
the
same
argument
would
have
been...
could
have
been
made
and
probably
was
made
in
spearin,
and
this
court
nevertheless
implied
warranties
arising
out
of
the
course
of
conduct
between
the
parties
and,
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
the
same
argument
that
was
available
there
didn't
prevent
the
government
contractor
from
being
protected.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
two
closest
cases
on
point
in
that
regard
are
the
traveler's
insurance
case
out
of
the
federal
circuit
and
the...
or
is
it...
i'm
sorry,
maybe
the
third
circuit,
and
the
williams
mcwilliams
case
that
we
cited.
those
are
two
court
of
appeals
cases
that
applied
spearin
directly
and
said
there's
no
reason
to
restrict
spearin
and
the
basic
implied
warranties
that
are
embodied
in
spearin
to
be
cut
off
based
simply
on
contract
performance
when
to
do
so
is
to
expose
these
individuals
to
greater
harms,
and
basically--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
in
the
one
case
a
person
fell
off
of
a
tower
that
had
been
improperly
built
according
to
government
specifications.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
read
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
one
thing
that
spearin
says,
and
i
think
this
applies
just
as
well
with
the
warranty
as
it
does
with
the...
excuse
me,
with
the
indemnification
as
with
the
warranty,
the
contractor
will
not
be
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
defects
in
the
specifications.
that's
the
rule
of
law
that
spearin
announced
and,
interestingly,
it
derived
that
rule
from
a
series
of
state
court
cases
applying
just
general
common
law
principles,
that
it's
a
settled
rule
that
you
are
not
held
responsible
for
defects
that
the
government
foists
upon
you.
and
in
this
case,
to
go
back
to
the
implied
warranty
component
of
the
case,
the
defect
that
we
were
dealing
with
was
that
a
process
that,
if
you
followed
exactly
what
the
government
commanded
you
to
do
under
the
contract,
would
create
dioxin,
and
everyone
concedes
that
dioxin
is
an
extremely
hazardous
substance,
and
it
was
that
dioxin
that
the
united
states
then
used
to
defoliate
the
jungles
of
vietnam
and
expose
thousands
of
people
to
injury.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
could
ask
for
that,
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
don't
have
any
leverage
at
that
point.
i
mean,
we
can
ask
for
indemnification,
but
they
can
say,
we're
not
going
to
put
in
an
express
indemnification
provision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
of
course
they
can.
either
that,
or
you
can
face
civil
or
criminal
penalties,
but
it
doesn't
seem
like
a
good
option.
and
you
will
recall
in
the
thompson
facts,
which
i
think
are
the
most
compelling
facts
you
could
possibly
have,
they
had
given
up
producing
these
kind
of
herbicides.
they
were
then
ordered
to
produce
them.
mr.
thompson
came
to
the
defense
department
and
begged
not
to
have
to
do
this,
and
was
told
no,
and
that
was
after
they
had
refused
to
make
a
proposal
to
bid
on
the
particular
manufacture.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
government
asks
the
contractor
to
provide
them
with
cost
information,
and
they
build
that
in,
and
then
they
set
a
price.
you'll
notice
the
price
of
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
united
states
sets
the
price
they
set...
and
then--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
you
would
still
have
a
specifications
argument,
and
you
would
still
have
a
superior
knowledge
argument,
but
i
do
agree
that
the
underlying
compulsion
that
forces
us
to
the
table
in
the
first
instance
provides
the
strongest
argument
in
my
mind
with
respect
to
implied
indemnification.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
and
in
fact--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
fact,
justice
o'connor,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
adopt
a
theory
that
extends
beyond
the
combination
of
compulsion
and
compelled
specifications
and
superior
knowledge
as
a
combination.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
all
three
of
those
uniquely
fit
into
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
in
which--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--under
section
707?
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
lower
courts
have
in
fact
held
in
that
manner.
on
the
other
hand,
this
particular
case
went
the
other
way.
it's
far
from
clear
to
me
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
that...
you
see,
my
theory
on
boyle
is...
i
mean,
the
government
argues
that
boyle
is
rendered
superfluous
by
the
provision
of
a
contract
remedy
here,
and
i
think
that's
wrong
on
two
counts.
first
of
all,
i
think
consistent
with
the
way
the
court
analyzed
the
relationship
between
tort
claims
and
contract
claims
in
hatzlachh,
in
hatzlachh
you
recall,
that
was
the
case
of
an
implied
bailment
agreement
and
there
was
also
a
tort
claims
immunity,
and
there
was
also
the
right
to
go
against
individual
officers
in
order
to
recover,
and
the
court
said
the
availability
of
that
remedy
in
no
way
undermined
the
ability
to
get
a
contract
remedy
and,
therefore,
under
the
facts
of
our
case,
the
availability
of
a
"remedy
boyle"
shouldn't
in
any
way
deprive
us
of
what
otherwise
would
be
a
valid
contract
remedy.
i
think
the
logic
of
hatzlachh
applies
here
directly,
but
i
also
think
the
importance
of
boyle
is
that
it
require...
is
that
if
we're
right,
and
we
are
entitled
to
be
indemnified
under
these
circumstances,
what
that
means
is
that
the
government's
exposure
to
liability
will
be
significantly
reduced.
we
should
win
most
of
these
cases,
and
the
government
should
act
responsibly
to
recognize
its
role
as
a
putative
indemnitor
and
come
to
our
defense
in
situations
in
which
these
issues
arise.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
that's
the
nature
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--unless
the
united
states
exercises
its
role
as
an
indemnitor
and
takes
over
the
defense
of
the
claim,
in
which
case
it
doesn't
lose
anything
as
a
consequence
of
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we're
not
attempting
to
get
the
government
to
pay
us
attorney's
fees
in
this
particular
litigation.
we're
talking
about
attorney's
fees
as
damages
arising
out
of
third
party
litigation
and
that
kind
of
damages
is
quite
common,
and...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
point...
and
i
think
the
reason
why
it's
different
is
that
the
government
has
a
unique
relationship
with
contractors.
they
enter
into
a
special
relationship,
and
while
it
is
true
that
there's
a
general
maxim
of
law
that
you
have
to
deal
in
straight
corners
when
you
contract
with
the
government,
there's
also
a
rule
of
law
that
says
that
the
government,
when
it
enters
into
a
contract
with
private
individuals,
tends
to
assume
the
same
obligations
as
private
individuals.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
we
can
put
in...
we
don't
put
in
the
costs.
we
submit
what
we
think
our
costs
are
and
the
government
sets
the
price,
and
the
government
is
free
to
exclude
that
as
a
legitimate
cost
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
we
don't
have
any
leverage,
justice
ginsburg,
in
dealing
with
the
price
term.
that
term
is
set
by
the
government,
just
as
every
other
term
in
this
contract
is
set--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
not
in
the
way
that
term
is
used
in
the
context
of
an
existing
contract.
the
difference
between
an
implied
in
law
contract
that
is
not
subject
to
the
tucker
act
is
one
like
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
case
the
government
cites,
where
you
provide
a
benefit
to
the
government
without
any
agreement,
and
then
you
seek
to
be
reimbursed
on
a
quantum
meruit
theory.
this
court
and
the
federal
circuit
has
consistently
held
that
that's
the
implied
in
law
contract
for
which
there
is
no
tucker
act
sort...
excuse
me,
waiver.
with
respect
to
a
situation
where,
here
we
have
an
existing
agreement,
then
you
can
imply
the
terms
to
that
agreement
based
on
the
relationship
between
the
parties,
and
i
can--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
and
the
argument
is
that
under
ordinary
contract
principles
involving
indemnification,
the
underlying
assumption
is,
is
that
the
party
who
has
control
will
indemnify
the
party
who
is
innocent
and
is
exposed
to
particular
injury.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
have
not
seen
from
the
government
a
persuasive
argument
why
anything
in
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
petitioners
should
cause
the
court
to
deviate
from
what
the
ordinary
rules
of
contract
interpretation
would
be.
and
the
three
arguments
the
government
put
forward
are
that
this
will
interfere
with
the
tort
claims
remedies,
and
this
court
specifically
rejected
that
in
hatzlachh,
saying,
we
look
at
contract
as
a
contract
issue,
we
look
at
torts
as
a
tort
issue,
is
there
a
contract
situation
here?
if
that's
all
you're
looking
at,
then
we
look
to
ordinary
principles
of
federal
common
law
contract
law,
and
those
principles,
it
seems
to
me,
say
that
when
you
have
compulsion
and
specifications
and
superior
knowledge
that
there
ought
to
be
indemnification.
and
when
the
defect...
remember,
we
were
compelled
to
make
a
product
that
was
inherently
dangerous.
that's
the
defect.
that
creates
a
warranty,
and
that
creates
another
contract
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
an
extraordinary
amount
of
experience,
no,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
i
think
it
comes
out
of
just
straight
indemnification
law.
the
rules
of
indemnification
say
we
should
be
protected.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'd--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--there
was
an
allegation
of
a
taking
in
the
thompson
complaint,
but
until
we
are
not
compensated
under
the
contract
theories,
there
wouldn't
be
a
basis
for
saying
we
had
not
received
just
compensation
yet,
but
there
is
a
takings
issue
that
underlies
all
of
this.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
begin
with
judge
plager's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
below
that
the
law
affords
substantially
more
justice
than
the
majority
below
conceded.
the
united
states
at
the
podium
here
today
did
not
defend
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
on
causation,
and
essentially
did
not
defend
the
court
of
appeal's
interpretation
of
the
defense
production
act.
on
that
basis
alone,
you
ought
to
vacate
and
send
it
back
to
allow
us
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
the
precise
contours
and
the
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
indemnification
and
breach
of
warranty
claims
that
we
think
this
court
has
already
acknowledged
and
recognized
can
be
readily
implied
in
the
ordinary
contracts,
and
that
ought
to
be
applied--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--justice
ginsburg,
i
would
answer
that
by
reference
to
justice
breyer's
question,
when
he
said
that
people
who
deal
in
government
contracts,
and
i'm
not
one
of
them,
look
at
things
like
spearin
claims
and
helene
curtis
claims
and
other
claims,
and
the
truth
is,
what
this
court
ought
to
hold
in
the
context
of
this
case
is
that
this
is
a
hercules
and
thompson
claim,
where
you
have
compulsion,
and
specifications,
and
superior
knowledge
all
combined
in
one.
it
is
perfectly
fair
and
just
to
imply
within
the
contours
of
that
contract
that
there
will
be
an
indemnification.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think,
though,
the
court
could
hold
that
if
the
facts
are
as
i've
described
them
to
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
you
have
to
assume
that
for
summary
judgment--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
understand
that,
but
the
rule
of
law
ought
to
be
one
in
which
we
have
an
opportunity
to
recover,
and
that
the
remedy
that
the
government
offers
us,
the
government
contract
defense
as
our
sole
opportunity
to
protect
ourselves,
was
revealed
as
plainly
in
this
case
as
it
can
be
revealed
is
inadequate.
there
are
gaps.
it
doesn't
cover
everything,
and
in
a
situation
where
you
have
an
innocent
party
and
a
controlling
party
and
an
indemnification
arrangement
on
a
government
contract
or
any
other
contract,
the
appropriate
course
is
to
find
that
the
innocent
party
is
indemnified
and
to
hold
the
government
liable.
under
that
theory
of
law,
which
i
think
applies
here,
i'd
ask
the
court
to
reverse
and
send
it
back
for
further
proceedings.
thank
you,
your
honors.
