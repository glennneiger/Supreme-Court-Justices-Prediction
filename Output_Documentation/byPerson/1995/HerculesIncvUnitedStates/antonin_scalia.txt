who
can't
recover
against
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
really
find
your
simple
fairness
argument
a
little
hard
to
take
in
this
field.
i
mean,
if
there's
anybody
who's
been
done
out
of
simple
fairness,
it's
the
soldiers
who
were
injured
by
this
thing,
and
they
can't
sue,
so
haven't
we
abandoned
simple
fairness
in
this
field?
justice
antonin
scalia
should
we
be
outraged
that
the
companies
cannot
pass
on
their
liability,
when
the
injured
parties
themselves
can't
recover?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
the
companies
had
golden
parachutes,
too,
or
something
else,
but
that's
a
different
question,
whether
they
can
get
moneys--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
assume
it
follows
from
your
position
that
if
you
would...
if
the
government
would
have
to
contribute
to
your
settlement
you
would
also
logically
have
a
claim
against
the
government
if
you
didn't
settle
and
ultimately
won.
you'd
have
a
claim
against
the
government
for
your
attorney's
fees,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
my
goodness,
why
is
that?
i
mean,
even
people
who
are
prosecuted
criminally
by
the
government
and
expend,
you
know,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
defend
themselves
and
are
ultimately
found
innocent
do
not
have
a
claim
for
indemnification
against
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
whether
it's
reasonable
to
imply
that
term
in
a
contract
with
the
government
surely
is
colored
by
the
fact
that
the
government
doesn't
even
pay
off
when
it's
prosecuted
you
wrongfully
and
you
have
to
expend
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
defend
yourself.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
same
government
who
doesn't
pay
you
off
in
that
situation
likely
have
entered
into
an
implied
contract
with
you
to
pay
you
off
in
what
seems
to
me
the
much
less
heinous
situation
that
you're
complaining
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
different
government
you're
talking
about,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
party
is
the
government.
the
average
party
is
not
a
party
who
has
sovereign
immunity,
and
what
terms
are
implied
in
a
contract
with
the
government
surely
is...
ought
to
be
colored
by
the
fact
that
the
government
usually
doesn't
pay
people
off
for
litigating.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
it
will
always
pay
your
attorney's
fees,
and
that's
why
this
case,
on
the
way
you
present
it,
is
not
a
fluke.
even
when
your
client
wins,
as
it
ought
to
in
the
lower
courts,
your
client
will
have
a
claim
against
the
united
states
for
whatever
it
cost
to
defend
those
suits,
successfully
or
unsuccessfully.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
fluke.
this
will
come
up
all
the
time
now.
whenever
the
suit
is
brought,
money
expended
will
be
ultimately
taken
out
of
the
united
states'
pocket.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
just
stop...
isn't
that
an
argument
against
all
implied
terms
in
government
contracts?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
gray
area
at
all.
i
mean,
the
argument
proves
much
too
much.
it
means
you
cannot
have
any
implied
terms.
