who
sets
the
price,
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
allege...
excuse
me.
would
you
be
here
at
all
if
the
petitioners
had
an
option
to
enter
into
the
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
certainly
this
court
would
not
have
to
adopt
any
theory
that
would
extend
beyond
the
compulsion--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--combination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
case
sort
of
a
sport,
because
in
most
instances
the
lower
courts
are
going
to
find
that
the
companies
have
a
full
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under...
under
the
law
that
allows
the
contractors
to
have
a
defense
to
third
party
claims.
boyle--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
is
this
kind
of
a
sport
in
that
regard?
i
mean,
i
would
think
that
in
most
instances
the
boyle
rule
would
protect
the
contractor
in
these
circumstances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
you
win
here,
can
thompson
assert
a
valid
takings
claim?
the
company
was
compelled,
over
its
objection,
to
produce
this
substance
for
the
government.
it
had
no
choice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
do
you...
does
any
logical
reason
occur
to
you
why
they
wouldn't
prevail
on
the
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
whether
it's
a
valid
takings
claim
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
the
government
compelled
them
to
do
it
against
their
will.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
lost
their
company,
everything.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
thompson
had
given
up
production
of
this.
they
were
not
producing
it.
they
were
compelled
to
produce
it
by
a
government
order.
