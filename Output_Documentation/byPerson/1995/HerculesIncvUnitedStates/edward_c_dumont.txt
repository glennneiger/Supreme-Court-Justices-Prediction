mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
our
view,
there
are
three
related
reasons
why
petitioner's
implied
warranty
claim
in
this
case
should
fail.
let
me
touch
on
them
briefly.
i
think
the
court
has
already
touched
on
them.
first,
judicial
implication
of
what
amounts
here
to
an
open
ended
indemnity
against
third
party
product
liability
claims
brought
years
after
performance
is
completed
under
the
contract
would
be
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
straightforward
contract
interpretation.
second,
it
would
be
unnecessary,
because
even
on
petitioner's
view
of
the
facts,
because
of
the
existence
of
the
government
contractor
defense
to
tort
liability,
there
is
no
unfairness
here
in
this
kind
of
situation,
and
third,
it
would
be
unwise,
because
it
would
permit
exactly
the
kind
of
cost
shifting
to
the
government
that
this
court
has
held
would
impermissibly
undermine
the
government's
retention
of
immunity
from
suit
for
exercise
of
its
discretionary
functions.
now,
we
start
out
by
saying
what
we
all
know
here.
there's
nothing
written
in
these
contracts
about
a
warranty
or
indemnity
running
from
the
government
to
the
suppliers.
in
fact,
the
only
thing
you'll
find
if
you
look
at
those
contracts
is
a
warranty
running
from
the
supplier
to
the
government
that
the
product
would
be
free
of
defects
in
manufacture
and
design.
leaving
that
aside,
we
all
recognize
that
what...
and
even
petitioners
recognize
what
they
have
to
establish
here
is
a
contract
implied
in
fact,
or
a
contract
term
implied
in
fact,
and
yet
what
we've
heard,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out,
is
an
argument
for
a
contract
implied
at
law,
an
argument
that
it
is
unfair
to
do
what
was
done
here,
an
argument
that
the
government
compelled
them
to
do
certain
things...
i
mean,
if
you
push
that
argument
to
its
extreme,
you
eliminate
the
contract
entirely,
and
so
their
argument--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
wouldn't
want
to
comment
on
the
validity
of
the
claim.
they
could
assert--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think,
the
claim.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
have
two
answers.
1)
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
better
claim
than
the
claim
they
have
raised
here.
2)
the
context
of
this,
of
course,
is
requiring
citizens
to
do
things
in
time
of
war
that
help
the
government
in
prosecuting
its
war
effort.
now,
the
government
required
a
lot
of
people
to
go
to
vietnam
and
use
agent
orange.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
only
this,
that,
you
know--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--only
this--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that
might
prove
to
be
a
valid
claim.
it
is
not
a
valid
resistant...
it
is
not
a
valid
answer
to
the
government's
ability
to
compel
you
to
do
military
service,
that
you
are
being
forced
into
involuntary
servitude.
it
is
not
necessarily
a
taking
of
your
property
for
the
government
to
contract
with
you
on
commercially
reasonable
terms
to
produce
a
product--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--at
a
normal
price.
now,
remember
that...
excuse
me,
but
just...
remember
that
these
are
products
that
these
companies
produced
for
the
commercial
market.
agent
orange
is
not
a
magical
thing.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thompson
is,
in
that
regard,
different,
very
different
from
hercules,
that's
true.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
quite,
sir.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--to
the
extent
i
understand--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
sort
them
out,
but
let
me
try
to
direct
my
answer
to
one
of
them,
which
is
the
notion
of
wouldn't
it
be
reasonable
to
interpret
the
contract
in
light
of
all
the
surrounding
circumstances.
well,
i
think
our
answer
to
that
is,
of
course
one
interprets
a
contract
in
light
of
the
surrounding
circumstances.
a
contract
implied
in
fact
is
one
that
is
taken
not
out
of
the
court's
views
of
what
is
just
or
right,
but
out
of
what
it
believes
the
parties
might
reasonably
have...
either
did
agree
to
through
their
course
of
contract
or
their
words,
or
might
reasonably
have
agreed
to,
and
there's
obviously
a
gray
area.
there
are
some
cases
where
no
one
had
any
contemplation
of
a
particular
situation.
now,
when
we
get
to
that
in
a
government
contract,
whatever
the
rule
would
be
in
the
case
of
an
ordinary
contract
between
private
parties,
when
we
get
to
a
government
contract,
there
are
particular
reasons
for
believing
the
government
would
not
have
agreed
to
any
such
thing,
any
kind
of
indemnity
such
as
petitioners
are
seeking.
first
of
all,
there's
the
anti
deficiency
act.
congress
has
made
it
very
clear
for
180
years
that
they
do
not
want
government
officials,
government
officers
entering
into
obligations
on
behalf
of
congress
that
have
open
ended
liability,
go
beyond
current
appropriations,
and
can
stick
the
united
states
with
huge,
uncertain
bills.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there
is
definitely
a
gray
area
there.
it
could
be--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
spearin.
if
the
court
would
like
to
revisit
spearin
on
that
basis,
i
think
that
might
be
a
good
idea,
but
the
answer
is
that
what
the
lower
courts
have
tried
to
do
with
that
is
say,
look,
there's
a
difference
between
breach
of
contract
in
which
the
officer
had
the
authority
to
enter
into
the
contract,
and
we're
talking
about
breach
damages
which
are
relatively
reasonably
bounded
by
what
the
original
contract
was
about,
what
the
original
appropriation
was
about
and
so
on.
there's
a
difference
between
that
and
an
open
ended
sort
of
indemnity
provision.
that's
the
line
the
federal
circuit
has
drawn,
which,
of
course,
is
the
court
that
is
primarily
charged
in
the
claims
court,
the
courts
that
are
primarily
charged
with
making
sense
out
of
this
area.
now,
the
other
thing
i
would
point
out,
when
the
government...
when
congress
decides
it
wants
to
give
indemnities,
it
does
so
specifically,
and
with
great
care
50
u.s.
code
section
1431
provides
for
indemnities
in
exactly
the
kind
of
situations
that
we're
talking
about
here
with
defense
contracts,
gives
the
secretary
of
defense,
the
president,
broad
authority
to
enter
into
contracts
without
regard
to
normal
terms
like
the
anti
deficiency
act,
but
it
requires
procedures.
now,
petitioners
never
asked
for
it.
those
procedures
weren't
complied
with.
they
don't
even
allege
that
there
was
an
indemnity
under
that
provision.
well,
if
there
wasn't--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
50
u.s.
code
section
1431.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
and
it's
discussed
at
some
length
in
our
brief
at
page
40,
footnote
23.
there
is
another
provision
just...
i
could
go
on,
but
there's
another
provision...
this
one
is
not
cited
in
our
brief...
10
u.s.
code
section
2354,
which
happens
to
have
to
do
with
military
r&d
contracts.
if
you
look
at
that
one,
you'll
see
again
a
kind
of
careful
structure.
it
looks
like
an
indemnity,
it
talks
like
an
indemnity,
and
congress
put
it
there
specifically.
now,
the
government
does
not
impliedly
agree
to
indemnify
people
for
open
ended
liabilities.
now,
another
reason
why,
and
this,
i
think,
goes
back
to
your
point
about,
when
we're
interpreting
a
contract
with
the
government
we
think
about
what
the
government
might
have
had
in
mind,
and
in
this
case
the
government
would
have
had
in
mind
that
it
is
immune
from
tort
liability
for
injuries
that
allegedly
arise
from
the
exercise
of
its
discretionary
functions.
now,
the
court
made
it
very
clear
in
boyle
that
the
discretionary
function
exemption
in
tort
law
covers
design
decisions
for
military
equipment.
now,
we're
not
saying,
under
hatzlachh,
that
that
precludes
the
court
from
reading
this
contract
to
include
an
indemnity
or
warranty
provision,
but
it
strongly
suggests
to
us
that
the
government
would
not
have
wanted
to
enter
in,
sub
silentio,
to
a
warranty
provision
that
would
have
completely
vitiated
that
important
immunity.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no,
you
don't.
now,
i
do
want
to
be
clear
that
i
don't
believe
we've
conceded
either
of
the
points
that
you--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that
you
mentioned.
i
mean,
our
position
is
that
although
an
argument
under
707
raised
as
a
shield
would
certainly
be
a
vastly
stronger
argument
than
the
one
they've
raised
here,
it
was...
it's
been
rejected
by
the
three
courts
that
have
considered
it,
and
we
consider
that
to
be
the
right
answer.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
understand
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do
here.
now,
i
must
say
i
agree
with
the
implication
of
a
question
i
believe
was
from
justice
souter,
which
is
that,
if
anything,
the
existence
of
that
shield
provision
in
the
defense
production
act
shows
that
congress
thought
about
this
issue,
and
they
resolved
it
by
giving
contractors
a
shield
of
whatever
scope
it
turns
out
to
be
and
there
is,
therefore,
even
less
reason
to
think
they
authorized
their
contracting
officers
to
enter
into
broad
indemnities
that
would
just
simply
get
rid
of
the
reason
for
having
that
shield
provision
in
the
first
place.
why
should
they
bother
to
invoke
that
when
they've
got
an
indemnity
from
the
government?
now,
to
your
other
point,
petitioner's
counsel
keeps
talking
about
the
law
of
indemnity
as
though
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
if
this
were
a
contract
between
private
parties,
an
indemnity
would
be
implied.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
that
is
correct,
or
that
they
have
established
that.
but
in
any
event,
if
you
look
at
any
of
the
circumstances
where
the
government
provides
warranties
and
there's
an
executive
order
after
50
u.s.
code
1431,
which
i
mentioned
before,
that
goes
into
great
detail
about
how
to
do
indemnities.
that's
one
place
you
will
find
that
they
look
like
an
indemnity
clause
in
a
sophisticated
private
contract.
that
is,
they
give...
they
give
an
explicit
indemnity,
and
then
they
give
the
indemnitor
all
sorts
of
rights
to
participate
in
the
defense,
or
control
of
the
defense.
now,
of
course,
there
wasn't
anything
like
that
here.
now,
they
say
they
asked
us
to
participate
in
the
settlement.
that's
fine
they
asked
us
to
do
that,
but
we
had
no
liability.
that
was
our
position
from
the
beginning,
that
we
were
not
liable,
and
we
effectively
stood
apart
from
the
rest
of
that
litigation
until
it
was
settled.
we
did
not
participate
in
the
settlement
because
we
thought
we
had
no
liability.
i
find
that
unremarkable,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
should
be
implied
or
inferred
from
that
that
we
had
made
some
sort
of
contractual
commitment
to
pay
them
for
whatever
they
decided
to
settle
for.
i
would
have
thought
rather
the
reverse.
if
we
thought
we
were
on
the
hook...
if
we'd
ever
thought
we
were
on
the
hook,
of
course
we
would
have
been
involved
in
that
settlement.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
i
understand
the
argument.
i
believe
the
argument,
as
you
put
it,
is
an
argument
of
unfairness,
and
i
believe
that
is
not
an
argument
that
is
cognizable
under--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--no,
absolutely
not,
and
when--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
question
got
to
this
court,
we
participated
in
boyle.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
an
indemnitor
normally
knows
that
it's
on
the
hook
and
therefore
it
takes
over
the
defense,
so
that's
not
remarkable.
but
the
question
here
is
not
what
does
an
indemnitor
do.
the
question
is,
were
we
an
indemnitor,
and
that
is
what
petitioners
sometimes
seem
to
lose
sight
of,
and
their...
our
submission
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
way
government
contracts
have
always
been
interpreted,
the
way
government
indemnities
have
always
been
given
and
how
congress
has
considered
them,
you
will
find
no
basis
on
which
to
infer
that
the
government
would
have
agreed
to
this
term.
now,
i
think
you
can
also
look
at
that,
if
you
want
to
get
back
to
the
authorities,
look
at
spearin,
look
at
the
cases
that
preceded
spearin,
which
were
about...
well,
there
was
another
brooklyn
navy
yard
case.
that
navy
yard
caused
a
lot
of
problems.
there
was
an
excavation
case
with
borings
that
were
misrepresented
in
the
government's
specifications.
there's
a
dam
case
where
they
were
going
to
construct
a
dam,
and
the
government
specifications
said
it's
backed
with
soft
material
and
it
turned
out
to
be
boulders
and
rocks.
there's
a
stagecoach
case
where
there
was
mail
delivery
in
new
york
and--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
not
a
supreme
court
case.
i'm
talking
about
supreme
court
cases,
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with,
and
in
fact
the
case
that
justice
brandeis
cited
when
he
said
it
was
okay
to
apply
this
term
in
the
spearin
contract
was
a
case
called
kellogg,
which
was
an
implied
warranty
case,
which
had
to
do
with
a
bridge
builder
who
built
the
foundations
for
a
bridge,
and
then
he
turned
it
over
to
a
new
contractor.
well,
it
turned
out
the
foundations
weren't
correctly
done,
and
the
court
said,
well,
fine,
as
a
matter
of
standard
contract
law
we
infer
that
when
you
built
the
foundations
and
turned
them
over
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
bridge
on
top
of
them
you
were
warranting
that
they
were
correctly
made.
well,
there's
nothing
remarkable
about
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
just
filed
a
brief
saying
the
government
contractor
defense
should
be
recognized?
i
assume
we
could
have.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
assume
we
could
have.
we
were
involved
in
the
case,
of
course,
because
they
had
sued
us,
tried
to
implead
us--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--for
indemnity
and
contribution,
which
of
course
is
the
other
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i'm
not
sure...
aside
from
volunteering
to
cover
their
losses,
i
don't
know
what
else--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
we
would
not,
without
a
special...
without
a
special
appropriation.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
don't
know
what
would
have
happened
if
they
had
tried
to
invoke
the
executive
order
that
provides
for
indemnities
in
those
kinds
of
circumstances.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
have
been
granted
or
not
and,
far
as
i
know,
they
never
asked
for
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i'm
saying,
at
the
time
of
the
contract,
if
we
had
come
to
them
and
said
we're
going
to...
we'd
like
you
to
do
this
contract...
now,
of
course,
we
first
went
to
hercules
and
said
we'd
like
bids,
and
they
bid
competitively
to
get
these
contracts.
don't
forget
that.
but
in
thompson's
case,
we
went
to
them
and
said,
we'd
like
you
to
make
this.
they
said,
we
really
don't
want
to.
we
said,
well,
we
really
want
you
to,
and
we're
going
to
invoke
our
authority.
now,
they
did
negotiate
the
price
term.
they
came
back
to
us
and
said,
we
can't
make
money
at
the
price
you
said
you
were
willing
to
pay
us,
and
so
we
adjusted
that.
if
they
had
come
back
to
us
and
said,
we
are
very
concerned,
we
can't
get
insurance,
we've
gone
to
the
market,
whatever
they
might
have
said,
we
need
some
indemnity
because
the
california
courts
are
doing
strange
things
with
tort
law,
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
in
products
liability,
i
don't
know
what
the
government
would
have
said,
but
as
far
as
i
know
they
never
made
that
request.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's
completely
clear
that
in
costplus
contracts
the
government
does
recognize
those
prices.
in
these
fixed
cost
contracts,
i'm
not
intimately
familiar
with
how
those
prices
are
fixed,
but
my
understanding
is
that
that's
a
legitimate
item
of
overhead.
your
normal
products
liability
insurance,
your
litigation
expenses
insurance
is
all
part
of
your
price.
if
you
say
then
well,
we
charge
this
price
on
the
market
for
this
stuff,
and
we
need
to
get
some
more
insurance,
this
is
what
we
think
our
costs
are
going
to
be,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
that
wouldn't
have
been
taken
into
account.
now,
it
is
possible...
it
is
possible,
i
suppose,
the
government
could
have
just
adopted
an
entirely
unreasonable
position
and
said,
we
want
you
to
make
this
stuff
for
us
for
5
a
barrel
and
it
costs
you
50.
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
would
be
on
those
facts
except
that,
again,
if
the
government
starts
ordering
you
to
do
things,
then
we
are
very,
very
far
away
from
contracts
to
begin
with,
and
implied
in
facts
contracts.
if
the
government
is
being
perfidious,
the
last
thing
it's
going
to
do
is
start
impliedly
warranting
that
it's
going
to
hold
you
harmless
from
liability.
now,
if...
the
court
might
choose
to
try
to
impose
that
sort
of
liability,
but
that
would
be,
i
think,
quite
clearly
a
policy
decision
to
impose
liability
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
believe
our
position
is
that
we
had
the
authority
to
compel
performance,
and
there's
a
series
of
safeguards,
i
believe,
in
the
regulations--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--where
you're
supposed
to
go
to
people
who
make
it
normally
and
if
you
can't
find
them
you
can
go
to
somebody
else,
that
kind
of
thing,
but
ultimately,
bottom
line,
yes,
we
had
the
authority
to,
to
do
that.
now,
we've
talked
about
why
it's
unreasonable
as
a
regular
contract
matter
to
imply
this,
and
you've
talked
a
little
bit
in
colloquys
with
my
colleague,
developed
a
little
bit
why
it's
unnecessary.
there
is
this
government
contractor
defense
that
does,
in
fact,
provide
a
contractor
in
the...
in
petitioners'
situation
as
petitioners
allege
it
to
be
with
a
defense
to
tort
liability,
so
in
fact
they
are
not
left
holding
the
bag,
and
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
the
overall
fairness
of
the
legal
framework,
i
think
there
is
no
real
warrant
for
that
concern
precisely
because
of
that
defense.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
our
position
has
been
that
it
is
not,
and
that's
the
position
that
we've
taken--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--it
certainly
provides
that,
and
there
may
be
some
penumbral
scope
to
it.
i
think
our
fundamental
position
is,
you
have
to
look
very
carefully
at
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
did
that,
and
there's
no
indication
that
what
they
had
in
mind
was
giving
a
complete
hold
harmless...
well,
certainly
not
hold
harmless,
but
a
complete
shield
for
any
kind
of
liability
that
might
come
up.
after
all--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
again,
i
don't
want
to
pretermit
inquiry
into
the
scope
of
section
707
as
a
shield
provision,
but
our
general
position--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--our
general
position
is
that
707--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
it
certainly
falls...
if
the
passers
by
are
prevented
from
the
government...
by
the
government
contractor
defense,
if
it
turns
out
that
there
was
some--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--specific
thing
about
the
way
we
told
them
to
make
it--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--and
the
other--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--and
the
other
criteria
are
met--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--then
they
are
insulated
from
liability
and
we
are
insulated
from
liability,
because
we
can't
be
sued
in
the
first
place
because,
if
that's
the
ground
of
tort
liability,
then
it
comes
within
the
discretionary
function
exemption.
now,
i
think
that
points
out...
i'm
sorry.
well,
i
think
that
points
out
why...
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
government
contractor
defense
and
petitioner's
theory
as
a
sensible
way
of
resolving
this
problem,
because
the
government
contractor
defense
in
those
circumstances
prevents
liability
on
the
part
of
the
manufacturer
if
it's
really
something
that
should
have
been
the
government's
responsibility,
but
it
also
saves
to
the
government
its
immunity
from
that
suit,
so
neither
party
is
liable
and
a
loss
lies
where
it
falls,
which
is
the
result
of
the
tort
immunity.
now,
under
petitioner's
theory,
on
the
contrary,
what
you
get
is
a
direct
pass
through.
the
passer
by
does
recover
from
the
manufacturer,
and
the
manufacturer
then
recovers
from
the
government,
so
the
government...
so
the
manufacturer
is
now
protected,
but
the
public
policy
underpinnings
for
the
government
contractor
defense
have
now
been
vitiated,
because
the
government
ends
up
paying
the
substantive
liability,
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
under
any
circumstances
the
attorney's
fees
for
defense
of
the
tort
action,
so--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
that's
probably
right.
we
ave--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--not
in
those
terms,
no.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
our
position
has
been
that
they're
simply
separate
inquiries.
707
provides
a
shield
of
some
scope
for
actions
taken
under
compulsion
under
the
dpa.
now--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we
think
that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there
need
be
no
provision
for
the
difference,
but
in
fact,
i
think
it's
probably
right
to
say
that
because
of
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
right.
the
absence
of
any--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--gap
filler
would
not
be
a
reason
for
inferring
an
indemnity
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
the
contract.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there
may
be.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
government
contractor
defense
would
presumably
cover
most
of
those
things.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
may
not
be.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct,
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
we've
really
covered
the
basic
heads
here,
but--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--it's
important
to
understand
the
sequence
here.
judge
pratt
rendered
summary
judgment.
he
withheld
the
final
judgment
in
order
to
give
the
defendants
the
benefit
of
certifying
the
class
before
he
entered
it.
as
it
turned
out,
he
then
relinquished
control
of
the
case.
judge
weinstein
took
over,
and
he
simply
revoked
the
prior
summary
judgment.
now,
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
he
did
not
question
the
availability
of
the
defense,
he
questioned
whether
it
could
be
established
without
trial,
so
he
revoked
the
summary
judgment.
now,
he
then...
eventually
the
parties
settled.
that
case
went
away.
now,
he...
judge
weinstein
at
the
same
time,
you
have
to
understand,
had
revoked
the
summary
judgment
that
had
been
granted
to
the
government
on
grounds
of
feres
and
the
discretionary
function
exception,
so
he
was
bringing
everyone
back
in
and
saying,
i'm
going
to
send
you
to
trial
and
we're
going
to
find
out
what
happened
here,
and
then
we'll
sort
out
the
legal
issues
after
the
trial.
now,
after
the
settlement,
and
after
that
litigation
was
effectively
over,
there
was
opt
out
litigation
of
the
people
who
opted
out
of
the
class,
and
they
brought...
their
proceedings
were
continuing,
and
those
proceedings,
at
the
behest
of
the
manufacturers,
including
thompson
and
hercules,
judge
weinstein
also
went
back
on
his
ruling
on
the
third
party
liability
claim
as
to
certain
people
who
were
not
servicemen
but
were
relatives
of
servicemen.
so
in
that
context,
we
filed
a
motion
saying,
listen,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
group
of
plaintiffs,
and
you're
telling
us
that
the
government
is
not
immune
as
a
matter
of
tort
law,
then
there's
no
reason
for
the
government
contractor
defense.
you've
kicked
out
the
props
on
which
the
government
contractor
defense
rests.
and
so
if
you're
going
to
do
that
to
us,
then
it
seems
like
you
shouldn't
have
the
government
contractor
defense
for
them.
that's
section
1
of
our
submission.
now,
section
2
of
our
submission
is
several
reasons...
and
it's
in
the
joint
appendix.
i
commend
it
to
you...
several
reasons
why
there
might
be
factual
issues
about
the
applicability
of
the
government
contractor
defense,
but
no
court
in
that
action
either
judge
pratt,
judge
weinstein,
or
the
second
circuit,
ever
suggested
that
there
was
doubt
about
the
availability
of
a
government
contractor
defense
if
you
established
the
factual
prerequisites
for
its
application,
and
i
think
that's
quite
important.
just
to
sum
up,
again,
we
think
that
it's
unreasonable
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
to
think
that
the
government
would
have
agreed
to
this
kind
of
indemnity.
it
is
unnecessary
if
a
feres
justification
is
required
because
of
the
existence
of
the
government
contractor
defense
and
perhaps
section
707,
and
it
would
be
quite
unwise,
because
it
would
gut
the
government's
immunities
in
a
way
that
this
court
specifically
rejected
in
interpreting
the
government
contractor
defense
itself.
thank
you.
