justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
following
up
on
justice
kennedy,
what
happens
if...
how
do
they
fix
the
price?
suppose
the
company
says,
we
don't
want
to
produce
this
thing.
they
say,
you
have
to.
how
do
they
decide
what
the
price
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
general
principle
that
underlies...
do
you
have
a
lot
of
experience
in
government
contracts,
a
certain--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
maybe
you
can't
answer
this,
but
what
i'm
looking
for
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
things...
there's
a
superior
knowledge
claim.
there's
a
spearman
claim.
that
there's
a
this
case
claim
or
there's
a
that
case
claim
is
really
an
example
of
a
more
general
principle
that
there
is
somehow
thousands
and
thousands
of
government
contracts,
and
sometimes
in
silences
in
those
millions
of
different
government
contracts
that
arise
in
millions
of
different
circumstances
courts
will
imply
terms
that
don't
appear
there
in
writing,
and
they'll
take
into
account
all
kinds
of
things,
including
the
fact
that
the
government
is
at
issue.
what
i'm
looking
for
is
the
general
principle,
because
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
you're
looking
for
here.
you
have
very
unique
circumstances,
and
you
want
some
kind
of
term
implied
that
will
get
you
the
reimbursement,
and
what
i'm
looking
for
is
a
place
where
it's
written,
or
a
case
where
it's
written
as
to
what
are
the
general
principles
that
might
lead
someone
here
to
imply
a
term
that,
where
the
government
doesn't
cooperate
with
you,
or,
you
know,
all
the
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
say,
they...
there's
a
promise
to
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
finished?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
if
the
city
council
passed
a
regulation
that
made
a
house
owner
put
out
some
kind
of
paint
or
something
in
the
garage
and
he
said,
no,
i
don't
want
to
do
it,
i
don't
want
to
do
it...
you
have
to
do
it...
and
then
everybody
sues
the
house
owner,
wouldn't
the
court
sort
of
strain
at
an
interpretation
that
said,
oh,
the
house
owner
has
to
pay
the
whole
thing,
the
city
council's
off
free,
that
you
just
have
to
do
these
things.
it
incurred
tremendous
liability.
they'll
take
your
house
away.
wouldn't
you
at
least
look
to
see
if
the
statute
couldn't
be
interpreted
differently?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer's
yes,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
my
question
is...
i
mean,
that
was
the
sort
of
set
up.
[laughter]
the
question
is,
that
being
so,
why
wouldn't
the
federal
circuit
and
the
court
of
claims
and
everybody
else
involved
in
interpreting
contracts
also
try
to
interpret
a
contract
in
a
way
that
suggests
the
government
will
not
try
to
stick
a
person
with
such
an
unfair
result.
and
that's
just
a
way...
i
don't
know
whether
it
falls
in
a
spearman
category
or
an
ex
cello
category
or
some
other
category,
but
at
least,
wouldn't
you
interpret
a
government
contract
normally
where
it's
open
to
it
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
way
of
reading
this
contract
to
stop
people
from
having
to
go
to
the
takings
clause
in
order
to
prevent
some
kind
of
tremendously
unfair
result,
even
if
it's
unique
and,
therefore,
if
that's
so,
why
shouldn't
we
send
it
back
to
see
if
there
is
such
a
thing
here,
or
to
see
if
the
facts
warrant
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
on
the
issue
that
we
took
this
for
you
basically
conceded
error.
i
mean...
those
are
all
my
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
take
it
that
their
basic
point,
in
the
lower
courts,
was
yes,
yes,
that's
quite
right,
but
you
see,
here
we
are
trying
to
look
at
an
implied,
is
there
a
term
to
reimburse
us
implied
in
fact,
and
we
argue
the
government
had
superior
knowledge
as
to
the
danger.
we
look
at
indemnity
contracts
and
tell
you
that
indemnitors
normally
are
liable
when
they
won't
take
over
a
lawsuit
and
then
they
force
the
other
person
to
go
and
litigate
it,
though
they
could
come
in
and
run
it
the
way
they
think
it
should
be
run.
look
at
that
policy,
and
look
at
the
policy
of
707,
and
when
you
put
all
those
things
together,
you
will
see
there's
some
kind
of
implied
term
here.
i'm
looking
at
it
most
favorably
to
them,
and
what
i
don't
see
in
the
lower
courts
is
a
court,
like
the
fed
circuit,
that
ever
passed
on
that,
and
i
don't
see
the
facts
in
the
record
that
would
permit
them
to
pass
on
it,
and
that's
why
i'm
back
to
thinking...
indeed,
what
the
fed
circuit
said
is
it,
in
footnote
8
it
hinted
that
footnote...
both
footnote
8
and
the
other
thing
and
707
discussion
seemed
to
turn
on
errors
of
law
that
you
seem
ready
to
admit
are
errors
of
law.
that
is,
the...
this
problem
of
the
causation,
and
the
problem
of
707
being
limited
to
just
prioritization
of
contract,
and
i'm
not
positive
you
admit
that,
but
you
see,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
don't
we
have
to
send
this
whole
thing
back
if
we
think
those
are
errors
of
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
mean
it's
a
shield.
they're
looking
to
the
policy
in
order
to
decide
whether,
among
other
reasons,
there
is
an
implied
in
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
reason
would
obviously
be
that
you
think
they
have
a
tremendously
good
defense
called
the
government
contractor
defense,
and
instead
of
you
helping
them
make
it,
where
they're
defendants
with
hundreds
of
other
companies
and
there
are
whole
companies
at
stake,
40
billion,
instead
of
saying
to
the
judge,
judge,
we
think
they're
right,
instead,
i
guess
you
were
silent,
or
maybe
you
said,
judge,
i
think
they're
wrong...
i
don't
know
exactly
what
happened...
but
they
think
that's
very
unfair,
and
in
the
context
of
the
whole
contract,
you
put...
you
understand
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
an
indemnitor
is
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
indemnitors
normally
do.
they're
given
that
opportunity.
it's
a
normal
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you've
left
out
the
case
where,
in
fact,
the
product
caused
an
explosion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
your
interpretation,
i'm
sorry,
on
707?
you
agree
that
the
first...
2071(a)
says
the
government
can
say
to
mr.
smith,
mr.
smith,
you
must
produce
agent
orange,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
it
says,
no
person
shall
be
held
liable
for
damages
resulting
indirectly
from
compliance,
directly
or
indirectly,
is
that
meant
to
insulate
the
contractor
for
damages
that
flow
from
agent
orange
being
unreasonably
dangerous,
or
something
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
your
position
is
that
all
that
means
is
the
only
immunity
it
gives
is
immunity
from
some
other
person
who
had
a
different
contract
with
the
same
producer
saying
you
shouldn't
have
bumped
the
government's
contract
ahead
of
mine,
and
nothing
more?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if,
in
fact,
the
government
ordered
a
person
to
produce
something
which
was
an
explosive
and
it
blew
up
the
factory,
and
it
hurt
passers
by,
the
government
would...
they
would
be
liable,
the
government
wouldn't
be
liable.
is
that
the
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
saying
the
government
contractor
defense
makes
it
unnecessary,
basically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
the
government
contractor
defense,
in
your
view,
where
there's
an
explosion
because
of
the
government
specifications
means
that
the
contractor
cannot
recover
from
the
government
for
passers
by
who
are
injured.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
superior
knowledge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
take
it
it
isn't
that
you're
asking
that
you'd
like
us
to
hold
that,
but
i
take
it
that
technically
you'd
say
the
question
is
whether
the
fed
circuit
should
have
an
opportunity
to
ask
the
district
court
to
find
the
facts
so
that
one
can
decide
whether
or
not
that
should
be
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
don't
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
