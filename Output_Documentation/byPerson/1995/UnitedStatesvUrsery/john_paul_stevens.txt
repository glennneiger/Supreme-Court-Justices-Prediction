paul
stevens
but
mr.
dreeben,
isn't
that
only
half
of
the
blockburger
test?
the
forfeiture
does
not
include
an
element
that's
necessary
to
be
proved
in
the
criminal
case,
but
what
does
the
criminal
case
include...
i
mean,
but
it
doesn't
work
the
other
way
around,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
that
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
act
was
committed
on
a
particular
piece
of
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
it
may
be
that
they
needed
different
elements
for
the
two
different
offenses.
in
other
words,
they
did
not
have
to
prove
what
happened
in
the
house
to
forfeit
what
happened
elsewhere,
and
vice
versa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
blockburger
itself
was,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
also
a
conspiracy
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
also
a
conspiracy--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
was
not.
