justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
that
reason,
what
are
the
aims?
the
aims
in
the
case
of
instrumentalities,
you
forfeit
an
instrumentality
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
well,
three,
the
same
three
reasons
apply
for
the
purposes
of
criminal
punishment.
it
sounded
as
if
you
were
talking
about
deterrence,
incapacitation,
and
then
something
that
you
called
restitution,
but
it's
a
little
hard
to
see
how
it's
restitution
when
you're
giving
a
house
that
somebody
owned,
say
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
never
owned
that
house
before,
so
i
suppose
that
in
that
case
it's
just
the
first
two,
and
those
are
also
aims
of
criminal
punishment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
yes,
of
course,
that's
exactly...
exactly,
so
that
being
so,
if
this
looks
just
like
a
punishment,
taking
the
person's
house
away,
perhaps
for
good
reason,
and
what,
then,
is
the
reason
not
to
treat
it
like
punishment?
is
it...
punishment
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
is
it
solely
historic?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
is
there
anything
other
than
historic?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
just
that.
i
want
to
know
if
there's
anything
other
than
history.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
that's
why
we
put
people
in
prison,
because
they're
misusing
themselves,
and
so
they
can't
do
it
again
while
they're
there,
and
we
want
people
to
take
good
care
of
the
property,
so
we
deter
them...
i
mean,
it
sounds
awfully
similar
to
me,
and
also
it's
so
natural
to
say,
taking
the
house
away
from
the
person
and
giving
it
to
the
government
is
a
punishment,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
ends
your
case,
and
even
if
that's
so,
you
have...
and
i
just
want
to
get
out
from
you
all
the
possible
differences.
one
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
purposes.
i
got
that.
the
other
is
the
history.
is
there
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
manufacturing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
manufacturing?
suppose
the
crime
is
manufacturing.
you'd
not
have
to
show
what
he
used
to
manufacture?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
various
items
dealt
with
instrumentalities.
i
take
it
halper
did
not
deal
with
instrumentalities,
or
proceeds.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
does
that
matter,
because
traditionally,
i
take
it
the
government
traditionally,
the
civil
forfeiture
has
been
against
proceeds
or
instrumentalities,
and
does
that
fact
mean
that
we
shouldn't
take
halperin
as
really
undermining
various
items?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
instrumentalities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
thought
is,
if
the
government's
claim
is
primarily
historical,
and
also
based
on
precedent
and
history,
then
we
look
to
the
later
cases
and
we'll
have
to
say,
are
they
consistent
or
inconsistent,
and
then
i
suddenly
did
notice,
and
don't
know
what
to
make
of
it,
that
the
halperin,
et
cetera,
is
not...
is
not
the
historical
context.
it
was
a
civil
remedy
against
some
fraud.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
so
i
wonder
what
to
make
of
that,
in
your
opinion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what,
then,
is
the
harm?
i'm
finding...
what
i
find
difficult
is,
i
understand
how
one
might
label
this
punishment,
fine,
but
i'm
not
certain
that's
conclusive.
what's
the
actual
harm
caused
to
individuals
if
the
court
were
to
continue
in
the
case
of
instrumentalities
and
proceeds
to
follow
or
to
permit
under
the
constitution
a
basically
civil
approach?
after
all,
you
don't
object
to
having
this
proceeding
taking
place
quite
near
the
time...
does
it
have
to
be
in
the
same
courtroom?
can
it
be
that
afternoon?
i
mean,
what's
the
difference
to
an
individual,
as
long
as
it's
basically
a
single
model,
whether
it's
that
afternoon,
or
3
weeks
later,
or
the
day
before?
what's
the
basic
harm
that
you're
worried
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
you
are...
that's
my
point.
you
are
twice
put
in
jeopardy.
the
main
trial's
in
the
morning,
the
civil
forfeiture
is
in
the
afternoon.
that's
twice,
and
you
don't
object
to
that,
and
so
why
does
it
matter
if,
instead
of
it
being
the
proceeding
that
afternoon,
the
proceeding
was
held
3
weeks
later,
or
6
weeks
later,
or
2
days
earlier?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
so
now
it
all
has
to
be
in
the
single
case,
and
they
have
to
have...
in
other
words,
it
just
has
to
be
in
front
of
the
same
judge,
you're
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
don't
even
have
that
rule
in
respect
to
sentencing.
the
sentencing
process
takes
place
after
the
verdict
is
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
it...
actually,
the
sentencing
often
involves
issues
of
great
significance
that
were
not
present
in
the
liability
phase.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
other--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
what
the
other
being...
look,
the
qed
analysis,
formal
analysis,
various
items
deals
with
instrumentalities,
halper
didn't
deal
with
instrumentalities,
instrumentalities
have
a
pedigree
historically,
the
other
didn't,
and
therefore
the
other
cases
deal
with
excessive
punishment,
not
double
jeopardy,
so
draw
the
dots,
follow
the
dots,
it's
never
been
overruled,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
instrumentalities.
proceeds
are
an
easier
case
for
the
government,
possibly.
and
your
response
to
that
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
you
said
one
was
the
innocent
owner,
and
the
other
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
going
to
make,
which
is
what
i
want
to
hear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
special
kind
of
punishment,
and
so
it
somewhat
begs
the
question
just
to
call
it
a
punishment.
if
you
want
to
go
and...
so
that's
what
i'm
looking
for,
the
historical
basis,
et
cetera.
suppose
i
believe
it's
a
special
kind
of
punishment.
does
the
jeopardy
clause
apply
or
not?
now,
i
have
the
qed,
and
your
distinction
is
what
you've
been
saying.
