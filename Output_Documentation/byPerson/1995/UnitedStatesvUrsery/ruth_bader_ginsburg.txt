justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
dreeben,
if
we
stick
with
the
house
where
marijuana
was
dried,
i
thought,
based
on
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
that
you
would
say
that
should
be
treated
the
way
austin
was
treated,
as
an
excessive
fine
case,
but
doesn't
belong...
wasn't
that
the
problem
in
austin,
that
what
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
what
was
the
basis
in
the
prohibition
era
when
the
distillery
was
taken?
was
that
a
different
kind
of...
that
was,
i
think,
the
most
common
instance
of,
you
have
a
prosecution
against
the
manufacturer,
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
you
take
the
property.
was
that
under
a
civil
forfeiture,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
rather
new,
isn't
it?
we
haven't
had
criminal
forfeitures.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
mechanically,
how
does
it
work
out
in
the
district
courts
and
the
u.s.
attorney's
office?
i
don't
know
of
any
proceeding
in
the
united
states,
although
certainly
it's
common
abroad,
where
a
civil
claim
gets
tried
together
with
a...
with
a
criminal
case,
even
in
the
division
of
labor
that
we
now
have.
who
attends
to
the
forfeiture?
is
it
the
people
in
the
criminal
division
or
the
civil
division?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
tell
me
if
my
fix
is
this
is
wrong,
but
i
thought
that
part
of
the
old
idea
was
not
just
that
you
reify
the
thing,
but
that
you
arrest
the
thing
so
it's
no
longer
accessible
to
anybody,
and
that's
the
prohibition
era.
you
stopped
the
still,
the
distillery.
the
criminal
process
is
going
to
take
a
long
time,
but
if
stopping
the
still
means
that
you
can't
go
forward
with
the
criminal
prosecution,
that
certainly
changes
things,
so...
but
you
didn't
mention
that
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
forfeiture
is
to
stop
the
use
of
the
facilities
by
the
person
who
will
then
be
prosecuted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
i
thought
you
were
indicting
him
criminally
for
only
part
of
the
conduct
that
was
involved
in
the
forfeiture.
that's
what
i
understood.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
it
itself
a
hybrid?
the
court
didn't
say
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
it
says,
this
is
in
part
civil.
it's
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
too
much.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
finer,
the
decision
that
you're
defending
started
out
on
a
very
candid
note.
it
said,
10
years
ago
the
law
was
clear
civil
forfeiture
was
not
punishment
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
do
you
agree
with
judge
reinhardt
as
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
of
these
things
are
called
civil
forfeitures.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
halper
was
called
that.
austin
was
called
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
finer,
i
don't
quite
grasp
that,
because
the
flavor
of
the
two
cases
seems
to
be
remarkably
different.
halper
says
this
is
a
rule
for
the
extraordinary
case,
for
the
rare
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
the
one
of
a
kind.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
austin
seems
to
be
a
rule
for
every
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
finer,
with
respect
to
bennis,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
goes
this
way.
the
car
was
forfeited.
then
john
bennis
was
prosecuted.
he
should
have
moved
to
dismiss
on
double
jeopardy
grounds,
and
he
would
have
been
successful
under
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
there's
a
question
of
what
label
you
put
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
taking
that
car
was
not
so
different
from
taking
one
plymouth
whatever,
or
one
ford
victoria.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
finer,
can
i
give
you
a
specific
example--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
one
that
justice
scalia
suggested
in
his
kurth
ranch
defense...
dissent.
a
broker
commits
violations
of
the
law,
and
he's
first
administratively
sanctioned
with
a
fine,
and
his
license
is
suspended,
or
he's
told
he
can
never
be
a
commodities
broker
again.
then
there's
a
criminal
prosecution
against
him
for
the
identical
conduct.
under
your
reasoning,
i
take
it
that
the
criminal
prosecution
can't
get
brought,
or
it
can?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
first
one
is
not
penal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
it's
a
fine.
no.
it's
an
administrative
sanction.
it's
a
fine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
gave
you
a
case
of...
which
is
not
unusual.
somebody
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
both
disbarred
and
fined,
and
the
fine
is
meant
to
be
punishing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
in
a
civil
setting.
then,
prosecuted
for
the
securities
fraud
or
whatever.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
the
fine
doesn't
have...
come
self
identifying.
we
have
to
put
a
label
on
it,
and
it
is
meant
not
to
return
money
to
a
specific
pocket--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it's
a
fine
if
you
did
something
bad.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
austin
is
one
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i...
the
example
that
i
brought
up,
which
is
not
original,
is
something
that
i
think
is
pervasive
in
our
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
have
an
administrative
agency
that
licenses
and
sanctions,
and
then
you
can
have
a
criminal
prosecution
for
the
identical
conduct.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
various
items,
if
only
it
had
had
an
innocent
owner
exception,
would
have
come
out
differently?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
it
would
have
been
double
jeopardy?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
have
to
be
really
old
fashioned,
and
then
you
escape
the
double
jeopardy
problem,
but
once
you
put
in
an
innocent
owner
exception,
then
you
are
in
this
bind
where
the
forfeiture
proceeding
will
mean
you
can't
bring
the
criminal
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
said
that
putting
in
the
innocent
owner
exception
types
that
statute
as
punishment
in
a
way
it
wouldn't
if
you
just
take
it
away
from
any
old
person,
innocent
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like
bennis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
seems
to
me
very
strange
that
you
would
say
that
a
statute
that
is
trying
to
be
modern
have
an
innocent
owner
exception
gets
you
into
the
double
jeopardy
bind,
but
if
it's
like
the
bennis
statute
that
didn't
give
you
that
exception,
then
you're...
then
the
government
is
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
something
being
nonpunitive
for
purposes
of
the
procedure,
like
taking
one
plymouth,
but
being
criminal
for
purposes
of
applying
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
not
a
hypothetical
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
a
case
in
the
forfeiture
context.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
was
recognized
as
a
civil
forfeiture.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
police
got
the
evidence
to
show
that
contraband
had
been
carried
through
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
they
had
no
warrant,
they
had
no
probable
cause,
they
just
took
the
liquor
from
the
car,
and
then
they
said,
well,
now
we're
going
to
prove
that
this
car
had
been
proved
to
carry
contraband,
and
here's
the
liquor
that
we
illegally
seized.
when
the
court
said,
sorry,
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
that,
it
by
no
means
said,
and
you
can't,
government,
bring
these
proceedings
as
civil
forfeitures
anymore.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
penal
for
one
purpose--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
the
fourth
amendment.
it
was
not
penal
for
all
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
austin
was
one
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
against
that
you
have
200-odd
years
of
history,
and
a
whole
prohibition
era
where
this
was
standard
operating
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
a
label
of
excessive
fine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
implication
in
austin
itself
that
the
court
understood
that
that
excessive
fine
decision
was
going
to
be
carried
over
into
the
double
jeopardy
area?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
robbins,
many
states
now
have
for
punitive
damages,
part
of
the
award
goes
to
the
state
treasury.
part
goes
to
the
plaintiff,
and
part
goes
to
the
state
treasury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
understand
the
government
to
say
that
it
required
that
proof.
i
just
thought
that
they
were
saying
that
the
civil
forfeiture
was
based
on
things
that
were
happening
on
their
own
land--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
indictment
charged
a
particular
transaction
a
particular
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
just...
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
that
your
answer
to
my
broker
case,
or
lawyer
case,
you're
disbarred
first
and
you're
fined...
it
usually
happens
the
other
way
around,
but
it
could
be
that
the
disciplinary
committee
gets
you
first,
and
you're
no
longer
a
member
of
the
state
bar,
and
you've
had
to
pay
a
whopping
fine
for
what
you've
done.
then
you're
prosecuted
for
the
very
same
conduct.
under
your
argument,
i
take
it
you
could
not
later
be
prosecuted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
no
relation
to
how
much
your
clients
were
out
of
pocket.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
defendant
says,
i
don't
care
about
that
disproportionate
fine
if
it
gets
me
off
the
hook
from
going
to
jail--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
i'm
going
to
attack
the
second
prosecution.
the
first
one
i'll
leave
alone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
no--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
don't
want
to
bring
sovereignty
into
it.
