now,
do
you
think,
mr.
dreeben,
that
the
civil
forfeiture
could
be
punitive
for
purposes
of
the
excessive
fines
clause
and
yet
not
multiple
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
halper
maybe
could
be
viewed
as
a
multiple
prosecution
case
and
not
a
multiple
punishment
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
the
next
logical
step.
i
mean,
if
you
move
in
the
direction
of
saying
that
every
civil
forfeiture,
every
so
called
civil
forfeiture
is,
in
fact,
punitive,
the
next
step
is
to
apply
the
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
the
other
requirements
for
prosecuting
criminal
actions?
and
in
fact,
in
the
case
i
put
to
you
it
is
really
a
double
jeopardy
concept.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
in
fact,
didn't
the
court
in
austin
leave
open
the
possible
application
in
civil
cases
of
excessive
fines
clause?
i
thought
it
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
there's
a
statement
leaving
that
open.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
i
think
a
punitive
damages
award
can
be
a
punishment.
i
mean,
that's
my
view--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
covered
by
the
excessive
fines
clause,
and
so
forth.
that
doesn't
mean
double
jeopardy
applies.
