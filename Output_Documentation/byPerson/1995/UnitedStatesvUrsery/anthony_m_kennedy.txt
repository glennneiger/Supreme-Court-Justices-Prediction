justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--suppose,
mr.
dreeben...
suppose,
mr.
dreeben,
you
had
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
forfeiture
against
the
owner
of
a
property
because
the
property
had
been
used
for
a
drug
transaction
but
the
owner
was
not
criminally
liable.
the
owner,
say,
was
culpable
in
that
it
knew
what
was
going
on,
but
was
not
criminally
liable.
would
the
excessive
fines
analysis
of
austin
apply
in
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
owner
of
the
property
say,
this
is
excessive
because,
what,
you
are
punishing
the
other
person--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--excessively,
or
you're
punishing
me
excessively
compared
to
what
the
use
of
the
property
was?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
question
is,
do
we
apply
that
analysis
at
all
to
the
owner
who's
not
guilty
of
a
crime
but
who
nevertheless
is
sufficiently
aware
of
the
drug
proceeding
so
that
the
forfeiture
is
being
permitted--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--assuming
that
culpability
is
required.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
that
owner
did
not
commit
any
crime
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
doj
have
guidelines
for
when
it
will
pursue
criminal
as
opposed
to
civil
forfeiture?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
wanted
to
proceed
by
criminal
forfeiture
and
there
were
one
criminal
defendant
but
two
owners
of
the
property,
could
the...
is
there
some
intervenor
procedure
where
the
noncriminal
defendant
can
somehow
be
involved
in
the
criminal
proceeding?
i
don't
see
how
that
would
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it's
not
punishment,
then
does
that
mean
it's
not
for
an
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
the
better
argument
that
it's
not
the
same
offense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
dreeben--
--so
on
that
line
of
reasoning,
it's
not
the
same
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
conceding
it's
an
offense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
you
don't
concede.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
had
a
forfeiture
under
the
federal
statutes
of
an
automobile
and
the
judge
gave
some
erroneous
instructions,
could
the
government
appeal
if
it
lost
in
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
the
government--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
take
it
a
forfeiture
case
is
tried
by
a
jury--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
civil
forfeiture
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
think
it
follows
from
your
argument
that
the
government
could
not
appeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
that
ever
been
held
in
any
case
in
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it's
the
same
offense.
those--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--those
are
the
terms
that
appear
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
government
gave
a
hypothetical
something
along
the
lines,
if
you
have
smith
and
jones
in
smith's
car,
and
they're
both
dealing
in
marijuana,
you
can
convict
the
nonowner
for
the
criminal
offense,
and
it's
completely
different
elements
in
order
to
forfeit,
in
order
to
forfeit
the
automobile.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
have
to
confront
the
same
offense
question.
