mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
the
earliest
years
of
this
nation,
congress
has
authorized
the
government
to
seek
parallel
in
rem
civil
forfeiture
actions
and
criminal
prosecutions
based
on
the
same
underlying
events.
until
recently,
the
pursuit
of
such
parallel
actions
was
deemed
to
raise
no
question
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
two
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
however,
united
states
v.
halper
and
austin
v.
united
states,
prompted
the
courts
of
appeals
in
these
two
cases
to
conclude
that
the
cumulative
remedies
of
in
rem
civil
forfeiture
and
criminal
prosecution
violated
the
multiple
punishments
doctrine
under
the
fifth
amendment.
these
holdings
are
incompatible
with
the
long
tradition
and
practice
in
this
country,
and
are
incorrect
for
four
reasons.
first,
civil
forfeiture
is
not
categorically
punitive
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
forfeitures
in
this
case
were
not
punishment.
second,
an
in
rem
forfeiture
action
is
not
a
jeopardy
that
can
give
rise
to
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
when
the
government
seeks
to
prosecute
the
owner
of
the
forfeited
property
for
a
criminal
violation.
third,
civil
forfeiture
of
property
under
21
u.s.c.
881
is
not
the
same
offense
as
the
criminal
prosecution
of
the
owner
of
the
property
for
having
violated
the
narcotics
laws
and,
finally,
parallel
contemporaneous
civil
forfeiture
actions
and
criminal
prosecutions
shall
be
deemed
to
constitute
a
single
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
therefore
not
to
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
the
overriding
question
that
is
presented
in
both
of
these
cases
and
in
many
others
that
are
being
litigated
in
the
lower
courts
is
whether
in
rem
civil
forfeiture
should
be
deemed
to
be
punishment.
both
of
the
courts
below
adopted
a
categorical
rule
that
the
forfeiture
that
is
accomplished
by
application
of
section
881
should
be
categorically
deemed
punishment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
do.
the
question
that
this
court
has
considered
in
determining
whether
civil
forfeitures
should
be
subjected
to
analysis
under
the
excessive
fines
clause
is
really
an
issue
of
whether
it
is
sufficiently
punitive
to
trigger
the
threshold
applicability
of
that
clause,
and
this
court
held
in
the
austin
decision
that
civil
forfeiture
does
have
such
a
punitive
component
both
historically
and
in
its
contemporary
applications,
but
civil
forfeiture
has
never
been
deemed
so
punitive
when
considered
in
light
of
its
simultaneous
remedial
aims
as
to
constitute
either
a
prosecution
or
a
punishment
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
correct
analysis
here.
in
halper
itself,
the
court
applied
a
case
by
case
analysis
to
determine
whether
a
particular
sanction
applied
in
a
particular
case
constituted
an
impermissible
punishment.
the
court's
conclusion
in
austin
that
categorically
civil
forfeiture
warrants
analysis
under
the
eighth
amendment
does
not
dictate
that
all
civil
forfeitures
applied
in
all
cases
at
all
times
should
be
deemed
punishment
with
the
rather
radical
consequences
that
were
accomplished
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
halper,
analyzed
in
the
terms
that
the
court
analyzed
it,
was
a
multiple
punishments
case,
but
it
is
nonetheless
true
that
under
halper,
there
is
some
confusion
about
the
exact
test
that
the
court
adopted
in
that
case
due
to
different
formulations.
but
our
reading
of
halper
is
that
a
sanction
that
is
rationally
related
and
can
be
explained
by
reference
to
underlying
remedial
purposes
is
not
to
be
deemed
punishment
for
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
even
if
there
may
be
some
element
of
punishment
associated
with
that
sanction.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
answer
to
that
question
goes
in
part
back
to
the
roots
and
origins
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
itself.
that
clause
was
an
embodiment
of
common
law
protections
that
were
accorded
to
finality
in
a
criminal
judgment,
and
they
were
accorded
to
the
criminal
judgment
in
very
specific
contexts
that
this
court
has
developed
over
time
in
a
series
of
rather
intricate
and
complicated
rules.
it
has
never
been
the
case,
though,
that
the
pursuit
of
an
in
rem
action
against
property
and
the
criminal
prosecution
of
the
owner
of
the
property
for
separate
violations
would
be
deemed
to
constitute
an
impermissible
multiple
punishment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
the
answer,
justice
scalia,
is
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
protection
against
multiple
punishments
that
has
been
recognized
in
this
court's
cases
as
subsumed
by
the
fifth
amendment,
that
protection
has
been
limited
and
defined
in
very
specific
contexts,
and
has
never
been
a
freestanding
doctrine
that
would
invalidate
any
and
all
simultaneous
or
contemporaneous
pursuit
of
two
actions
that
had
some
punitive
component
to
it.
and
what
the
courts
below
did,
i
think,
is
take
to
the
absolute
logical
limits
the
principle
that
was
in
part
reflected
in
halper,
recognizing
a
prohibition
against
multiple
punishments,
and
have
taken
that
principle
and
extended
it
so
that
it
overrides
very
familiar
common
law
practices
that
were
well
known
to
the
framers
and
that
have
been
reflected
throughout
the
history
of
this
country--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
agree,
justice
souter,
that
history
is
not
the
entire
answer
to
this
problem.
to
take,
for
example,
the
issue
of
proceeds
forfeitures,
which
are
authorized
under
title
21
and
were
not
part
of
the
common
law
of
forfeiture,
we
are
not
claiming
here
that
the
historical
pedigree
of
forfeiting
the
proceeds
of
crimes
is
what
explains
why
that
forfeiture
is
not
punishment.
it's
our
submission
that,
analyzed
as
a
matter
of
reason
and
logic,
and
in
light
of
the
common
law
principle
that
unjust
enrichment
included
gaining
funds
or
moneys
through
illegal
means,
and
that
it
was
not
a
punishment
to
take
those
profits
away
from
the
wrongdoer,
we--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--right,
that's
correct.
i
think
in
austin
all
forfeitures
of
facilitating
property,
property
that
can
be
used
to
facilitate
or
to
commit
a
crime,
are
subject
to
analysis
under
the
excessive
fines
clause
because
the
court
concluded
that
they
represent
some
punishment
to
the
owner
of
the
property
at
least
in
part,
but
the
court
did
not
conclude
that
all
forfeitures
that
are
accomplished
of
facilitating
property,
or
all
forfeitures
that
are
carried
out
under
these
statutes,
will
be
punitive
such
that
that
is
the
only
explanation
for
the
sanction,
which
is
the
test
in
halper.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
let
me
first
put
in
the
historical
context
the
forfeiture
of
facilitating
property
and
apply
it
to
the
real
estate
in
this
case.
the
common
law
recognized
in
a
wide
variety
of
contexts
the
potential
for
forfeiting
property
that
was
used
in
the
commission
of
a
crime,
and
your
example
of
boats
that
were
used
for
importing
goods
without
declaration
i
think
is
a
salient
example.
there
were
many,
many
others.
at
least
since
1868,
however,
congress
has
provided
for
by
statute
the
forfeiture
of
real
estate
that
was
involved
in
the
commission
of
crimes
particularly
with
respect
to
failure
to
pay
tax
on
liquor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
the
argument
completely
goes,
justice
souter,
because
the
same
rationales
and
justifications
for
the
forfeiture
of
property
that
is
used
to
facilitate
a
crime
also
are
present
in
the
forfeitures
of
property
that
were
known
to
the
common
law,
and
the
fact
that
the
principle
is
being
applied
in
the
new
context
to
respond
to
new
problems
that
the
common
law
hadn't
faced
does
not
mean
that
it
is
something
that
would
be
unfamiliar
to
the
framers,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
that
was
under
a
civil
forfeiture,
and
what
that
led
to
was
this
court's
decision
in
various
items
v.
united
states
in
1931,
in
which
the
court
examined
a
claim
that's
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
claim
that's
being
made
here
today
that
the
forfeiture
of
property
following
a
criminal
conviction
of
the
owner
of
property
constituted
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
the
court
rejected
that
contention
by
reference
to
the
very
ancient
traditions
of
in
rem
forfeiture
which
had
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
a
variety
of
cases
such
as
the
palmyra
and
the
brig
malek
in
the
19th
century,
that
that
supported
the
treatment
of
such
forfeitures
as
not
sufficiently
punitive
as
to
trigger
the
double
jeopardy--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
court
has
not
articulated
what
the
proper
test
or
measure
of
excessiveness
is
under
the
eighth
amendment.
the
government's
position
is
that
the
proper
approach
to
analyzing
that
question
is
as
stated
in
justice
scalia's
concurrence
in
austin.
namely,
to
look
at
the
depth
and
extensiveness
of
involvement
of
the
property
in
the
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
that
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
austin,
that
there
is
eighth
amendment
analysis
that
can
be
invoked
at
the
behest
of
the
owner
of
the
property,
who
is
the
only
one
who
has
any
real
property
stake
in
the
forfeiture
itself,
and
that
that
person--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
well,
the
purpose
of
the
forfeiture,
both
historically
and
as
applied
today,
is
in
rem.
it
is
an
action
against
the
property,
and
the
theory
of
it
is
that
the
property
has
been
used
sufficiently
substantially
in
the
commission
of
the
offense
such
that
forfeiture
is
justified
for
three
historical
reasons
that
are
equally
applicable
here.
the
first
is
that
it
does
encourage
property
owners
to
take
care
in
the
use
of
their
property.
the
second
is
that
the
forfeiture
can
serve
to
abate
a
nuisance.
if,
for
example,
there
is
a
house
being
used
extensively
for
the
dealing
of
crack
cocaine,
the
government
can
move
in
and,
through
civil
forfeiture,
bring
an
action
against
the
property
and
abate
that
nuisance,
and
the
third
goal
is
to
provide
indemnity
to
injured
parties.
in
this
case,
the
injured
party
through
these
violations
of
the
law
is
the
government
itself.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
they
are
in
a
very
practical
sense,
justice
souter.
criminal
forfeiture
is
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
the
civil
forfeiture
remedies
that
we
use,
and
i
would
add--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
and
i
would
submit
that
we
have
done
so
in
these
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
then
i
think
we
would
have
a
very,
very
significant
practical
problem
if
we
were
not
permitted
to
use
the
alternative
remedies,
because
criminal
forfeiture
is
no
substitute
for
civil
forfeiture.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
in
this
country
there
was
no
tradition
of
criminal
forfeiture,
criminal
in
personam
forfeiture
until
1970.
the
major
difference
in
these
kinds
of
actions
is
that
the
in
rem
action
brought
civilly
is
against
the
property.
the
government
does
not
need
to
know
specifically
who
the
owner
of
it
is.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
forfeitures
can
be
handled
out
of
either
as
an
administrative
matter,
and
in
some
u.s.
attorney's
offices
the
criminal
division
does
it
and
coordinates
it
extensively
with
the
criminal
case.
in
other
u.s.
attorney's
offices
it's
handled
out
of
the
civil
division,
still
with
a
general
view
to
coordination
with
the
criminal
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
do
not.
we
have
extensively
been
turning
to
criminal
forfeiture
in
the
wake
of
the
decisions
in
these
cases
and
decisions
following
them
because
the
double
jeopardy
problems
that
have
surfaced
as
a
result
of
these
rulings
are
truly
enormous.
we--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
it
would
not
work,
because
when
we
initiate
the
civil
forfeiture
action
we
bring
it
against
the
property.
we
give
notice
both
to
the
world
and
to
anyone
who
we
believe
is
an
owner,
and
those
persons
can
then
come
into
the
case
and
attempt
to
establish
either
that
we
haven't
shown
probable
cause,
or
that
they
have
an
innocent
owner
defense,
but
civil
forfeiture
enables
us
to
move
in
in
situations
where
we
really
don't
know
who
the
owner
is.
for
example,
if
we
break
up
a
substantial
drug
ring
and
we
recover
numerous
bank
accounts,
cars,
nominee
securities
accounts,
other
means
of
transportation
that
may
be
titled
in
nominee's
names,
we're
not
entirely
sure
who
all
the
owners
of
it
are.
we
can
go
in,
seize
the
property,
initiate
an
in
rem
action,
give
notice
to
the
world,
and
allow
the
owners
to
come
in.
if
we
were
attempting
to
use
criminal
forfeiture
for
the
same
purpose,
we
could
have
a
serious
problem
when
we
do
not
have
a
good
faith
basis
to
go
to
a
grand
jury
and
say,
we
think
that
this
individual
is
the
owner
of
the
property
and
that
we
should
include
a
count
in
the
indictment
that
would
authorize
forfeiture
of
it,
so
there
is
a
very
significant
drawback
that
we
have.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
require
that
the
forfeiture
be
alleged
and
set
out
in
the
indictment,
and
this
court
discussed
in
the
libretti
case
earlier
this
term
some
of
the
requirements
that
follow
from
that.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
in
an
in
personam
criminal
forfeiture,
what
we
are
entitled
to
get
is
the
interest
owned
by
the
defendant.
we
cannot
go
in
and
bring,
through
a
criminal
action,
what
is
the
equivalent
of
an
in
rem
action
to
quiet
title
as
against
the
world,
because
the
owner
of
the
property
whose
interest
can
be
forfeited
is
only
the
defendant
himself.
so
if
we
do
come
across,
for
example,
a
house
that's
being
extensively
used
for
drug
dealing
and
for
traditional
remedial
aims,
we
want
to
go
in
and
shut
it
down.
we
can't
do
that
at
all
through
criminal
forfeiture
in
any
kind
of
an
expeditious
way.
criminal
forfeiture
helps
us
largely
at
the
end
of
the
process,
when
it
can
truly
be
imposed
as
a
punishment
for
punitive
purposes,
but
the
in
rem
tradition
has
typically
been
viewed
as
serving
very
substantial
remedial,
legitimate
aims
of
the
civil
law
and
it
therefore
is
not
sufficiently
punitive
to
be
characterized
as
punishment
under--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
are
three
reasons--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
don't...
there
are
purposes
that
are
served
by
both
civil
and
criminal
law,
and
i
don't
think
that
any
purposes
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
not
solely--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
not
solely
historic.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
there
is.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
there
is
reason
itself.
the
primary
aim
of
the
criminal
law
is
to...
is
retribution
and
deterrence.
those
are
its
primary
aims.
when
one
speaks
about
abating
a
nuisance,
that,
of
course,
also
can
be
analogized
in
some
way
to
incapacitation,
but
it's
really
quite
different
from
incapacitation,
particularly
when
the
object
of
the
action
is
property
itself
that
is
being
misused
in
a
certain
fashion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
once
you
are
talking
about
the
purposes
and
the
history,
and
this
court's
cases,
you
are
essentially
covering
the
issue,
but
it's
not
to
be
lost
sight
of
that
this
court
said
as
recently
as
the
bennis
decision
that
deterrence
is
an
aim
distinct
from
any
punitive
purpose,
and
it
has
always
been
true
in
civil
forfeiture
law
that
deterrence
has
been
a
recognized
purpose
and
aim.
in
the
brig
malek
decision
in
1844,
justice
story,
describing
the
purposes
of
civil
forfeiture,
said
that
it
was
to
suppress
a
wrong
or
offense,
and
to
provide
indemnity
to
the
injured
parties,
and
those
purposes
are
equally
parallel
to
this
case.
the
government
loses
substantial
funds
both
in
a
sense
of
investigating
and
detecting
and
prosecuting
funds,
prosecuting
crime,
that
it
cannot
otherwise
recover
easily
from
criminal
defendants.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--punishment
will
always
have
a
deterrent
purpose,
but
merely
having
a
deterrent
purpose
is
not
sufficient
to
brand
a
sanction
as
punitive
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
meant
to
do
that,
justice
ginsburg,
in
stating
that
it
serves
the
traditional
purpose
of
abating
a
nuisance,
of
preventing
the
ongoing
commission
of
the
crime,
which
is
quite
similar
to
what
this
court
described
as
the
purpose
of
the
forfeitures
in
bennis,
and
was
quite
similar
to
the
purposes
of
the
forfeitures
that
were
imposed
in
the
common
law
era,
and
then
later
pursuant
to
statutes
in
this
country.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i...
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
exactly
right,
justice
souter,
and
although
that
had
not
been
traditionally
accomplished
through
forfeiture,
it
had
been
traditionally
recognized
as
no
issue
under
the
fourth
amendment
whatsoever
for
the
government
to
seize
the
proceeds
that
a
robber
derives
when
he
goes
into
a
bank
and
comes
out
with
money.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
one
would
hope.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
both
analogies
work,
although
the
concept
that
i
was
trying
to
describe
is
that
of
simply
that
depriving
the
wrongdoer
of
the
ill
gotten
gains
that
he
has
derived
from
criminal
activity
is
not
punishment.
it
simply
restores
the
status
quo
ante
of
that
person
had
he
not
engaged
in
the
criminal
activity
at
all.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
could
be
conceived
of
as
not
being
for
an
offense,
but
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
strictly
speaking,
as
proceeds,
the
reason
why
it's
not
punishment
is
that
the
owner
of
money
derived
from
crime
has
no
right
to
retain
them
at
all.
but
it
is
also
our
position
that,
even
if
one
takes
this
as
a
straightforward
blockburger
case
and
applies
normal
double
jeopardy
rules,
that
the
in
rem
forfeiture
is
not
the...
it's
not
an
offense
at
all,
and
it
is
not
the
same
offense
as
the
underlying
criminal
indictment
of
the
owner
of
the
property.
i
think
that's
so
most
simply
for
the
following
reason.
if
in
rem
forfeiture
is
conceived
of
being
an
offense
by
a
person,
it
can
only
be
the
owner
of
the
property
who
must
be
viewed
as
the
nominal
defendant.
the
question,
then,
that
has
to
be
asked
is,
what
do
we
have
to
prove
in
an
in
rem
action
in
order
to
sustain
our
burden
of
taking
the
property
with
respect
to
that
individual,
and
the
answer
is
nothing.
we
do
not
have
to
prove
that
that
person
engaged
in
a
crime
or
did
anything
wrong.
all
we
have
to
do
is
show
that
the
property
was
used
in
the
criminal
activity.
and
so
to
take
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
mr.
ursery
and
his
wife
and
his
son
were
all
coconspirators
in
manufacturing
marijuana,
we
could
have
taken
the
property
in
our
forfeiture
action
based
on
his
son's
activities,
without
proving
anything
as
to
him,
and
there
is
therefore
no
necessary
requirement
that
we
prove
any
culpable
action
or
any
state
of
mind
as
to
the
owner
of
the
property
in
the
in
rem
action.
in
contrast,
that
is
the
whole
ball
of
wax
in
the
criminal
case.
we
must
prove
that
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
case
engaged
in
the
act
with
the
requisite
mental
state.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
brown
v.
ohio,
justice
souter,
really
addresses
a
quite
distinct
problem.
in
a
brown
v.
ohio
situation,
the
government
is
necessarily
going
to
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
committed
some
felony
which
was
then
aggravated
by
the
death
resulting,
and
as
a
result
the
crime
is
called
felony
murder.
and
this
court's
holdings
is
that,
even
though
felony
murder
subsumes
all
of
the
different
felonies
that
that
defendant
may
have
committed,
it
doesn't
matter
which
one
the
government
proves,
it's
as
if
there
are
as
many
separate
crimes
in
the
criminal
code
as
there
are
predicate
felonies,
each
one
aggravated
if
death
results.
whereas
in
the
civil
forfeiture
case,
we
never
have
any
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
owner
of
the
property,
the
person
who
is
supposedly
punished
by
this
"offense",
and
as
a
result,
it
seems
very
strange
to
say
that
it
is
a...
the
same
violation
that
would
be
proved
by
the
government
in
a
criminal
case
brought
specifically
in
personam
against
that
defendant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
does,
justice
stevens,
because
we
aren't
required
to
prove
that
any
property
was
used
in
a
violation
in
order
to
obtain
a
conviction.
what
we
are
required
to
prove
is
that
the
defendant
did
the
act.
in
the
forfeiture
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
the
act
does
not
necessarily
involve
the
use
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
think
that
you
can--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
don't
have
to
prove
any
particular
piece
of
property,
and
in
fact,
ironically
enough,
in
this
very
case
ursery's
criminal
conviction
arose
out
of
his
manufacture
of
marijuana
on
somebody
else's
property,
and
thus,
even
looking
at
the
question
of
whether
the
same
offense
exists
on
the
very
facts
of
the
case,
the
civil
forfeiture
in
this
case
and
the
criminal
violation
were
not
the
same
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
the
basis
of
the
forfeiture.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
the
criminal
offense
had
everything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
marijuana
was
being
grown
on
somebody
else's
property.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
was
the
basis
of
the
criminal
case.
the
civil
case
had
to
do
with
the
property's
use--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
indictment
charged.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that's
exactly
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
simply
on
the
facts
of
this
very
case,
but
i
think
that
it
does
illustrate
that
in
the
criminal
case
we
do
not
need
to
prove
anything
about
his
ownership
of
property,
or
his
use
of
any
particular
property,
and
i
think
the
blockburger
point
is
even
more
clear
in
the
proceeds
cases,
because
in
those
cases
we're
required
to
show
that
the
defendants
conspired
to
or
did
engage
in
substantive
drug
violations,
but
we're
not
required
to
show
how
much
money
they
made,
what
property
they
used
in
those
violations,
or
anything
else,
and
the
moneys--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--a
money
laundering
case
would
be
different
to
that
extent,
yes,
but
it
would
still
not
be
the
same
offense
as
the
forfeiture
offense
for
the
reasons
that
i've
described.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
excuse
me?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
and
you
don't
have
to
show
that
he
used
any
particular
property,
or
that
he
owned
the
property
that
was
involved
in
the
offense.
the
more
fundamental
reason
why
we
think
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
regard
the
forfeiture
as
a
greater
offense
which
can
preclude
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
is
that
that
turns
the
entire
notion
of
what
a
greater
offense
is
on
its
head.
normally,
when
the
government
brings
a
criminal
charge
for
a
greater
offense
and
fails
to
prove
the
additional
element
that
makes
it
a
greater
offense,
the
court
can
reduce
a
conviction
to
the
crime
of
the
lesser
offense,
or
the
jury
could
be
instructed
to
return
a
verdict
on
the
lesser
offense.
that
plainly
cannot
happen
in
any
case
in
which
the
government
brings
a
civil
in
rem
forfeiture
action,
and
it
underscores
the
oddity
of
characterizing
civil
forfeiture
as
a
greater
offense
that
can
have
this
very
dramatic
consequence
of
barring
any
criminal
prosecution
of
the
property's
owner
based
on
the
same
underlying
facts.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
return
again
to
the
fact
that
we
do
also
argue
that
the
two
proceedings
that
were
brought
in
each
of
the
cases
before
the
court
were
sufficiently
contemporaneous
so
that
they
should
not
be
viewed
as
successive
proceedings
that
invaded
any
legitimate
expectation
of
finality
that
the
defendants
in
these
cases
have.
when
this
court
in
halper
prescribed
a
new
rule
that
had
not
really
been
recognized
in
any
prior
case
law
that
forbid
multiple
punishments
from
being
pursued
in
separate
proceedings
by
the
government,
it
explained
that
the
reason
why
two
proceedings
is
important
is
that
it
was
to
prevent
the
government
from
seeking
the
second
sanction
because
it
was
dissatisfied
with
the
outcome
of
the
first.
that
cannot
be
said
of
any
of
the
proceedings
in
these
cases.
the
government
in
the
405
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
brought
the
criminal
indictment
and
the
civil
forfeiture
complaint
within
5
days
of
each
other.
it
brought
the
civil
forfeiture
complaint
in
the
sixth
circuit
case
within
4
months
of
the
criminal
prosecution,
and
the
civil
forfeiture
action
was
settled
by
mr.
ursery
before
he
went
to
trial
on
the
criminal
offense.
the
government
clearly
had
made
evident
its
intent
to
seek
both
of
these
familiar,
traditional,
parallel
remedies
against
the
defendants
from
the
very
outset
of
these
proceedings,
and
the
defendants
never
could
have
had
any
expectation
that
they
would
not
be
subject
to
the
full
range
of
authorized
sanctions
that
were
provided
in
federal
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
a
criminal
case
what
would
emerge
to
prevent
that
is
the
protection
against
successive
prosecutions.
the
government
cannot,
once
jeopardy
has
attached
in
a
case,
pursue
a
separate
criminal
offense
based
on
the
same
underlying
offense
against
the
defendant,
because
the
rule
of
successive
prosecutions
would
prevent
that,
and
i
think
that
that
underscores
that
what
the
respondent--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that...
no,
i
think
it
assumes
that
because
the
successive
prosecutions
rule
has
always
been
limited
to
two
criminal
cases,
and
what
the
respondents--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
souter,
the
court's
conclusion
in
austin
that
civil
forfeiture
was
sufficiently
punitive
to
be
judged
under
the
eighth
amendment
specifically
and
explicitly
recognized
that
civil
forfeiture
was
not
and
never
had
been
recognized
as
a
criminal
proceeding.
if
it
was,
we
would
have
a
very
serious
double
jeopardy
problem,
but
it
would
have
been
one
that
the
framers
themselves
had
dictated
in
statutes
that
were
enacted
shortly
after
the
constitution
and
shortly
after
the
bill
of
rights,
and
that
had
escaped
everyone's
notion
for
200
years
until
united
states
v.
halper
came
down.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
halper
does--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--halper
does
produce
a
variety
of
very
strange
results,
and
that
is
why
this
court
should--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
correct,
and
it
did
that
in
the
context--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
the
question
in
halper
was
to
specifically
note
it
as
a
rule
for
the
rare
case.
what
the
courts
below
have
done
is
transform
it
to
a
rule
for
the
general
case.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you.
