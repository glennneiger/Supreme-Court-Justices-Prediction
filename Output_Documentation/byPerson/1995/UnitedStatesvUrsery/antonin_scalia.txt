justice

scalia
and
even
though
it's
considered
such
for
purposes
of
the
excessive
fines
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
can't
understand
why
somebody
who
would
write
a
constitution
would
think
that
a
punishment
is
a
punishment
for
one
purpose
but
not
another.
i
mean,
if
it's
punishment
enough
that
you
can't
make
it
excessive,
why
isn't
it
punishment
enough
that
you
shouldn't
get
it
twice?
what
policy
reason
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying...
i'm
sorry.
i
say,
i
suggest
that's
only
because
it
was
never
applied
to
multiple
punishments,
period,
of
any
sort.
i
mean,
greater
includes
the
lesser,
to
be
sure,
but
once
we
are
on
the
track
that
double
punishment,
as
opposed
to
double
jeopardy,
is
covered
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
i
don't
see
why
all
punishment
deemed
punishment
by
the
constitution
shouldn't
qualify.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben--
--but
deterrence
is
also,
you
know,
the
purpose
of
any
punishment.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
distinguish
this
from
other
punishments.
justice
antonin
scalia
almost
any
punishment
i
can
think
of
has
a
deterrence
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
finer,
what--
--with
the
same
elements?
with
the
same
elements?
do
you
need
the
same
elements
in
each
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
one
has
an
element
that
the
other
one
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wasn't
necessary
to
prove
that
offense
to
get
the
forfeiture.
you
could
have
proved
any
offense
to
get
the
forfeiture.
justice
antonin
scalia
using
blockburger
correctly,
blockburger
requires
that
the
charge
be
a
charge
which
would
require
the
same
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
simply
that
factually
it
happened
to
be
the
same
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
and
just
as
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
you
don't
have
any
mention
of
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
started
to
talk
about
the
text
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
that's
why
we've
been
led
into
this
difficulty.
you're
bringing
in
two
cases
in
which
you
are
not
put
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
thing,
not
in
the
sense
of
blockburger,
but
you're
just
saying
you
can't
be
punished
twice.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
it
be
seen
as
remedial?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that
gives
you
the
right
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
you're
trying
not
to.
[laughter]
