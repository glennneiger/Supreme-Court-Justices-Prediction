chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-345,
united
states
v.
guy
jerome
ursery,
and
number
95-346,
united
states
v.
$405,000
and
some
change,
consolidated
for
argument.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
may
have
just
such
a
case
if,
in
fact,
the
court
were
to
decide
that
these
were
not
parallel
proceedings.
if
you're
ruled
against
on
both
points,
then
i
think
your
point
would
be
taken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
criminal
forfeiture
you
have
to
have
an
indictment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
finer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
finer--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
government
argues
here
and
it
argued
in
its
brief
that
our
1931
decision
in
various
items
is
controlling.
you
do
not
even
mention
that
case
in
your
brief,
and
i
don't
believe
your
colleague
does,
either.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
tell
me
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
civil
forfeiture--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--just
like
the
government
has
brought
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then,
why
didn't
you
mention
it
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
various
items
was
a
unanimous
decision,
too,
and
neither
halper
nor
austin
made
any
reference
to
it
with
a
sense
of
overruling
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
in
bennis
we
said
that
there
can
be
a
deterrent
or
a
remedial
purpose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
there's
general
and
specific
deterrence?
we
certainly
never
said
that
in
bennis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can't
deter
him
in
the
sense
you
used
in
the
first...
putting
a
person
in
jail
may
deter
him
in
the
future,
but
it
doesn't
do
anything
about
his
past
conduct.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
simply
isn't
what
bennis
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
think
your
extrapolation
out
of
it...
is
it
based
on
some
case
that
we
have
decided?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
those
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
austin
wasn't
unanimously
decided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
nor
can
the
government
appeal
from
a
jury's
acquittal
in
a
criminal
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
do
you
say
it
could
appeal
in
a
civil
forfeiture
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
robbins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you,
like
mr.
finer,
didn't
mention
various
items
in
your
brief,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
ordinarily
we
expect
counsel,
when
there's
a
case
that
is
called
to
their
attention
that
bears
on
it,
and
particularly...
to
deal
with
it
in
some
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
felt
it
was
just
so
far
wide
of
the
mark
that
it
didn't
even
deserve
any
mention?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
cases
subsequent
that
have
distinguished
various
items
would
you...
are
you
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
punitive
damages
are
imposed
by
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
where
they
are...
where
somebody
other
than
the
government
imposes
a
judgment
for
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
10
seconds
remaining,
which
under
the--
[laughter]
under
the
maxim
of
de
minimis
non
curat
lex
means
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
consolidated
cases
no.
95-345,
united
states
against
ursery
and
no.
95-346,
united
states
versus
$405,089.23
to
be
exact.
after
the
police
found
marijuana
and
drug
paraphernalia
in
the
michigan
home
of
guy
ursery,
the
government
filed
a
civil
forfeiture
action
against
the
home
claiming
that
it
had
been
used
to
facilitate
a
drug
offense.
ursery
settled
the
forfeiture
action
by
paying
a
little
over
$13,000.00
to
the
government.
shortly
after
which
he
was
criminally
convicted
of
manufacturing
marijuana.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
vacated
his
conviction
based
upon
its
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
which
prohibits
the
government
from
imposing
multiple
punishments
for
the
same
offense
in
separate
proceeding.
the
court
decided
that
urseryâ€™s
criminal
conviction
in
the
civil
forfeiture
action
against
his
house
each
were
a
punishment
for
the
same
underlying
drug
offense.
in
the
second
case,
arising
in
california
charles
arlt
and
james
wren
were
convicted
of
various
drug
offenses
and
money
laundering
crime
based
upon
their
operation
of
a
large
scale
multi-state
drug
distribution
ring.
in
a
civil
action
following
their
criminal
conviction,
various
properties
owned
by
arlt
or
wren
were
forfeited
to
the
government
on
the
ground
that
the
properties
either
were
proceeds
from
the
illegal
drug
sale
or
had
been
purchased
with
drug
proceeds.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
forfeiture
finding
that
it
violated
the
double
jeopardy
clause
because
it
was
a
second
punishment
imposed
by
the
government
for
the
same
offenses
underlying
the
criminal
conviction.
we
consolidated
the
cases
for
review
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgments
of
the
court
of
appeal.
since
the
earliest
days
of
this
nation,
congress
has
authorized
the
government
to
seek
parallel
civil
forfeiture
actions
in
criminal
prosecutions
based
on
the
same
underlying
event.
in
the
series
of
cases
dating
back
over
60
years,
the
court
has
consistently
found
civil
forfeiture
not
to
be
a
punishment
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
like
the
forfeitures
that
we
previously
reviewed,
the
forfeitures
in
this
case
took
place
under
civil
rather
than
criminal
statute
and
the
forfeiture
actions
were
brought
against
property
used
in
violation
of
the
law
rather
than
against
individuals
who
might
have
used
the
property.
significantly,
these
forfeitures
serve
important
non-punitive
goal
such
as
encouraging
property
owners
to
take
care
and
managing
their
property
ensuring
they
will
not
let
the
property
be
used
for
illegal
purposes,
abating
nuisances,
and
preventing
people
from
profiting
from
illegal
act.
though
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prevents
the
government
from
imposing
two
or
more
punishments
for
the
same
offenses
in
separate
proceedings,
that
prohibition
is
not
implicated
in
these
cases
because
these
civil
forfeitures
are
not
self-punitive
in
form
or
fact
as
they
constitute
punishment
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
