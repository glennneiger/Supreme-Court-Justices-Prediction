justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
the
different
with,
or
at
least
a
difficulty
with
the
historical
argument
that
you're
making
that
some
of
the
forfeiture
in
this
case,
or
in
these
cases,
just
do
not
have
common
law
pedigrees?
it's
one
thing,
for
example,
perhaps
to
forfeit
a
vehicle
on
the
theory
that
it
stands
in
the
same,
or
is
in
the
same
position
of,
you
know,
the
boat
that
was
used
for
smuggling
and
so
on?
it
seems
to
me
quite
another
thing,
though,
to
apply
that
same
rule
and
to
invoke
history
to
apply
the
same
rule
when
we're
talking
about
the
forfeiture
of
all
equity
in
a
house
that
was
used
to
dry
some
marijuana,
and
so
i
don't
see
how
your
historical
argument,
even
if
i
accepted
it,
could
get
you
all
the
way
through
these
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
how
about
applying
the
house
example,
though,
as
it
were,
to
justice
scalia's
question?
i
take
it
we
really
don't
have
a
historical
pedigree
that
we
can
rely
on
there.
we
don't
have
an
unjust
enrichment
principle.
we've
got
a
kind
of
forfeiture
that
goes
beyond,
i
think,
what
the
common
law
knew.
why,
in
a
case
like
that,
should
it
be
punishment
for
excessiveness
purposes
or
potentially
punishment
for
excessiveness
purposes
but
not
for
double
jeopardy
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
that
doesn't
help
you
out,
i
think,
in
a
historical
argument,
which
essentially
is
they
understood
at
the
time
these
clauses
were
enacted
as
part
of
the
original
bill
of
rights
that
there
could
be
both
these
procedures,
the
criminal
prosecution
and
the
forfeiture.
once
you
get
into
sort
of
later
statutory
amendments,
whether
its
1878
or
1978,
that
argument
goes,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
point
at
which
justice
scalia's
question
attains
a
very
sharp
focus.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
of
course,
the
government
can
do
all
of
those
things
consistently
with
a
double
jeopardy
analysis
if
it
does
them,
as
it
were,
at
the
right
time,
so
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
you
say,
well,
if
you
apply
the
punishment
analysis
here
and
say
the
cause
applies,
these
historical
objectives
of
the
government
are
precluded,
because
they're
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
simply
have
to
bring
them
in
a
coordinated
proceeding.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
i
mean,
the
only...
my
only
point
is
that
there...
you
don't
have
here
a
case
in
which,
if
we...
if
our
position
on
this
point
does
not
prevail,
these
objectives
are
in
effect
precluded,
because
that...
all
i'm
saying
is,
they're
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
of
course,
that
doesn't
help
you
out
in
a
proceeds
case,
because
the
government
is
going
to
put
the
proceeds
right
back
in
circulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
putting
anything
out
of
commission
there.
i
suppose
your
argument
on
the
proceeds
case...
i
didn't
mean
to
get
into
this,
but
i
suppose
your
argument
in
the
proceeds
case
is
something
akin
to
contraband
that
you
don't
have
a
right...
no
one
should
be
deemed
constitutionally
to
have
a
right
to
proceeds
of
criminal
activity,
and
therefore
when
you
take
it
away
that
should
not
be
regarded
as
punishment.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
different
from
the
drug
sale
proceeds,
though,
because
in
the
robber
case
you're
going
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
bank,
as
justice
breyer
said.
you
really
are
engaging
in
a
restitution.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
we
do
hope
it
gets
back
there,--
but
i
mean,
here,
there's
no
way,
in
effect,
to
restore
the
proceeds
to
individuals.
in
fact,
they
were
not
taken
in
the...
by...
in
any
way
that
bears
analogy
to
the
bank.
your
argument,
as
i
understand,
is
that
you
are
restoring
the
proceeds
to
society,
but
that
is
not
like
restitution,
and
i
just
think
the
analogy
is
closer
to
the
contraband
than
it
is
to
restitution.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dreeben,
isn't
the...
i
think
i
follow
what
you're
saying.
the
difficulty
i
have
with
it
is
that
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
way
the
court
analyzed
the
problem
in
brown
and
ohio,
because
in
brown
and
ohio,
if...
the
court
in
effect
said,
well,
you
look
to
the
way
it
was
proved
in
this
case,
and
in
this
case
it
was
the
owner
of
the
property,
and
in
fact
all
of
the
elements
except
for
the
further
additional
element
that
is
raised
by
the
forfeiture
proceedings
were
shown.
if
we
follow
a
brown
and
ohio
kind
of
double
jeopardy
analysis,
then
i
think
we
have
to
go
the
other
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
where
the
act
involves
the
use
of
property.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it
involves
the
possession
of
the
drugs,
or
possession
of
proceeds,
whatever
the
case
may
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
money
that
is
laundered,
or
whatever
the
case
may
be.
you
can't
prove
an
offense
without
proving
some
sort
of
possession.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
basis
for
your
forfeiture
of
the
house
was
that
he
was
in
fact
using
the
house,
his
own
property,
in
drying
the
marijuana.
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--neither
the
forfeiture
nor
the
criminal
offense
had
anything
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
marijuana
was
being
grown
across
the
property
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
there
was
a
separate
offense
of
growing
marijuana
on
someone
else's
property?
justice
david
h.
souter
literally,
there
is?
i
didn't
realize
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
money
laundering
case,
however,
even
on
your
analysis,
that
would
be
different.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the
argument
that
the
other
side
made
that
if
that
is
a
sound
argument
you
could
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
two
parallel
criminal
prosecutions?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
assumes
that
in
the
civil
case
there
isn't
a
successive
prosecution
within
the
meaning
of
those
terms--
justice
david
h.
souter
--because
it's
not
punitive.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
gets
us
right
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
where
is
the
principle
of
coherence
in
saying
that,
number
1,
there
is
punishment
for
purposes
of
one
clause
but
not
of
another?
translated
into
this
particular
instance,
where
is
the
coherence
of
saying
that
something,
the
object
of
which
is
punishment,
is
criminal
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
that
leave
us...
i
mean,
halper
has
come
down,
and
doesn't
it
leave
us,
on
your
reasoning,
in
a
position
of
incoherence,
of
saying,
on
the
other
hand,
yes,
it
is
punitive,
but
not
for
purposes
of
defining
the
prosecution
or
the
action
in
which
it
is
going
to
be
enforced
as
a
criminal
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
strikes
me
as
just
intellectually
incoherent.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we're
talking
about
the
extent
to
which
it
is
too
much.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
thing
that's
bothering
me
in
all
this
is,
fine,
call
it
a
punishment.
