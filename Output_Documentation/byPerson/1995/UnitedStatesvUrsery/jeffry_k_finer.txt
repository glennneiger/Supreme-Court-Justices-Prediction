mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
decades
ago
congress
passed
really
what
was
the
first
ever
proceeds
forfeiture
statute,
and
before
this
time,
forfeitures
were
handled
either
against
contraband
in
a
remedial
fashion
because
the
item
was
either
inherently
dangerous
or
its
use
was
criminal
in
and
of
itself,
or
the
forfeitures
were
against
property
used
to
facilitate
a
crime.
the
proceeds
statute,
the
new
one,
takes
the
money
that's
either
used
for
an
illegal
transaction
and
gained
from
its
transaction
or
money
that's
merely
intended
to
be
used
for
the
transaction.
nevertheless,
there
are
similarities,
and
i
wanted
to
start
with
those.
like
the
predecessor
forfeiture
statutes,
the
1978
proceeds
statute
was
labeled
civil,
and
it
invoked
a
fiction
of
in
rem
jurisdiction,
and
this
court
has
provided
us
with
clear
direction
in
the
last
decade
what
we
do
with
those
labels
and
what
we
do
with
those
fictions.
we
look
at
underlying--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--yes.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
that's
correct.
the
1931--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--yes,
i
can.
the
government
argued
just
moments
ago
at
the
podium
that
the
decision
in
the
1931
case
was
that
the
forfeiture
was
so...
was
not
so
punitive
as
to
invoke
double
jeopardy,
and
that
is
not
the
holding
of
various
items.
various
items
got
to
the
actual
point
that
the
court
was
at
when
it
reached
halper,
but
various
items
stopped,
justice
sutherland
stopped
and
said,
but
this
penalty,
this
punishment
is
in
rem,
and
i
point
out
to
the
court,
in
various
items,
the
court
in
1931
had
no
problem
saying
this
tack...
excuse
me,
this
still,
the
taking
of
it,
had
punitive
aspects,
but
it
was
in
rem,
and
on
that
label
the
court
stopped.
the
modern
court--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--civil
forfeiture.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
oh,
i
do
not
disagree
that
they
are
remarkably
analogous
cases.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
in
part
because
the
modern
test
does
not
even
address
the
labels,
your
honor.
the
test
devised
by
this
court
in
two
unanimous
decisions--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--that's
correct,
and
in
fact
did
not
seem
to
use
it
for
support,
either,
and
so
we
see
no
support
for
the
argument
either
way.
if
any
case
is
undermined
in
the
modern
jurisprudence,
if
any
single
case
can
be
undermined,
i
would
concede
it
is
various
items,
but
that
issue
has
been
dealt
with
clearly
in
halper
by
rejecting
the
labels
jurisprudence.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i
agree
that
civil
forfeiture
was
not.
i
do
agree
with
that.
other
types
of
penalties
had
been
addressed
by
this
court
and
deemed--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i
agree.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
well,
let
me
correct
that.
traditionally,
civil
forfeiture
has
not
been
used
against
proceeds.
the
only
thing
even
remotely
close
to
it
have
been
the--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--the
instrumentalities.
there
have
been
cases
applying
a
tax,
in
effect.
in
fact,
the
case
decided
the
same
day
as
various
items,
which
is
lafranca,
was
a
fixed
tax
which
the
court
quickly
said,
this
may
be
called
a
tax,
but
the
label's
not
important,
it
is
a
penalty.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
that's
correct,
in
18--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--i
think
what
we
make
of
that
is,
when
we
have
a
statute
such
as
the
one
used
in
halper,
which
was
the
false
claim
act,
that
dates
from
roughly
1863,
a
civil
war
era
action
to
deter
and
punish
those
who
might
excessively
defraud
the
government,
and
in
that
case
the
court
did
not
have
a
historical
precedent
to
look
at.
this
was
not
historical
forfeiture.
this
was
a
brand
new
statute,
and
in
that
setting,
justice,
the
court
applied
the
analysis
that
i
would
urge
it
to
apply
today,
the
one
applied
unanimously
in
1989,
and
that
is,
first
look,
what
was
the
historical
setting?
forfeitures
in
the
historical
setting
have
been
to
punish.
that's
the
first
step,
but
it's
not
the
last
one.
the
next
step
is,
well,
historically
punishing,
what's
this
one
for,
and
halper
and
austin
together
show
us
the
next
line
of
inquiry.
is
it
tied
to
the
commission
of
an
offense?
well,
it
is.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
yes.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
yes.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
and
yet
they
are
entirely
harmonious,
for
this
reason.
in
halper,
the
court
was
not
dealing
with
a
historical
punitive
statute.
the
false
claims
act
was
historically
remedial,
and
so
there
is
a
test
for
that
circumstance.
when
it
is
historically
remedial,
you
go
to
halper.
the
rare
case
may
be
so
disproportionate
as
to
be
a
punishment,
but
in
the
modern
case
of
forfeiture,
we
know
that
it
is
not
inherently
remedial.
it
springs
from
a
root
that
has
been
punishment
for
at
least
the
last
200
years.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
yes,
and
in
bennis
the
deterrence...
the
language
is
very
interesting,
because
clearly
there
are
different
types
of
deterrence.
there
is
general
and
specific,
and
the
court--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--you...
that...
those
words
are
not
used,
and
yet
the
flavor
of
deterrence
that's
described
in
bennis,
the
remedial
form,
makes
sense
only
if
that
decision
is
made,
and
for
this
reason:
deterrence
is
a
forward
looking
concept.
there's
no
sense
of
deterring
what's
already
occurred.
one
deters
future
conduct,
and
in
that
sense
deterrence
is
a
remediation,
it's
to
prevent
a
future
matter,
but
deterrence
in
the
specific
sense,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
to
aim
at
the
one
who
has
violated,
and
it
has
a
backward
component.
it
has
a
component--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--no,
and
because
it
does
not
do
anything
about
its
past,
the
special
deterrence
case
is
punitive,
and
that's
why
deterrence
comes
up
in
the
cases.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
that's
true.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
no.
i'm
trying
to
harmonize
the
language
in
bennis
about
deterrence
with
this
court's
language
in
other
cases
which
were
unanimously
decided,
in
which
the
term
punishment
has
been
described--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--well,
austin,
for
instance.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
that...
no,
i
beg
your
pardon,
chief
justice.
in
which
the
term
deterrence
has
been
linked
inexorably
in
instance
after
instance
with
the
concept
of
retribution,
and
those
two
concepts
are
the
definition
of
punishment.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i'm
not
clear
he
would
have
been--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--and
for
this
reason.
in...
this
court
in
the
bennis
decision
made
a
point
of
adopting
the
state's
highest
court's
determinations.
what
was
the
character
of
that
statute?
now,
the
statute
that
took
the
car
was
considered
as
an
abatement,
an
equitable
statute,
and
when
that's
the
case,
well,
that
court
has
ruled.
this
court
has
said,
at
least
as
to
881(a)(4)
and
(a)(7),
that
we're
dealing
with
punishments
and,
in
fact,
forfeitures
are
dealing
with...
dealt
with--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--no--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--i
completely
agree,
and
from
the
subjective
standpoint
it
feels
the
same,
i'm
sure.
however,
the
authorizing
statute
springs
from
a
congressional
purpose,
and
it
springs
from
a
particular
history.
now,
in
michigan
the
purpose
was
an
abatement,
and
that
is
remedial,
and
i
have
no
qualm
with
that.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i'm
not
clear.
instructions
in
the
forfeiture
case?
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
ah.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
yes.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
yes.
i
understand
the
question.
would
the
government
have
a
right
of
appeal,
or
would
the
jury's
verdict
be
sacrosanct
against
even--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--court
error?
an
interesting
hypothetical,
and
i
think
the
question
would
be
the
government
could,
because
this
is
not
the
case
where
we
are
arguing
that
sixth
amendment
essential
criminal
properties,
or
essential
criminal
protections
apply.
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
kennedy
ward
pervasively
penal
test
applies
here,
and
consequently--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--yes,
where
you
could
not
be
tried
again
after
the
jury's
acquittal.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i
quite
understand.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
if
it
were
taken
as
a
double
jeopardy
analysis,
and
if
i
understand
the
justice's
question
at
this
stage,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
change
the
answer,
and
it's
not
a
hypothetical--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--and
i
have
to
agree.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
right.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
if
we
agree
that
the
error
by
the
trial
court
presents
a
second
jeopardy,
then
i
do
agree,
and
the
test
we
have
used
in
preparing--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--in
a
civil
case?
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
so
holds.
there
have
been
civil
sanctions
throughout
this
court's
history
that
are
held
to
be
penalties
and
held
to
invoke
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
i've
not
seen
the
circumstance
you've
described.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
it
goes
to
the
actual
harm
that
the
text
of
the
clause
is
intended
to
protect.
when
you
are
twice,
in
some
parallel
or
serial
fashion,
put
in,
some
way,
a
separate
proceeding,
when
you're
twice
put
in
jeopardy
of
some
punishment--
let
me
take
it
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
justice
breyer,
i'm
not
sure
i
would
object
if
they
were
separate
cases,
whether
they
were--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--i'm
not
even
sure
the
test
is
whether
it's
the
same
judge,
but
let
me
provide
what
i
think
the
test
is.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
the
test
seems
to
be
a
single
verdict
test.
if
you're
going
to
put
my
client
through
two
verdicts...
two
factfinders
or
not,
if
you're
going
to
force
my
client
to
two
verdicts,
and
in
the
preparation
for
the
two
verdicts,
in
one
case
you
take
all
his
property,
which
is
what
was
done
to
my
clients,
and
you
do
not
provide
counsel
for
that--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--quite
right.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
from
a
single
verdict.
but
in
this
case,
what
the
government
is
doing,
and
has
done
to
my
clients
and
many
like
them,
is
put
them
to
jeopardy
in
two
verdicts.
if
it
were
a
single
verdict,
and
your
honor,
it
is...
justice
breyer,
it
is
a
single
verdict
when
you
go
to
court
in
a
criminal
forfeiture
proceeding,
which
frankly
feels
pretty
rough
to
my
clients,
but
it's
not
the
same.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
absolutely,
and
in
fraud
cases,
for
instance,
you
don't
even
get
to
the
fine
part
of
the
fraud
case.
you
don't
even
have
evidence,
necessarily,
of
the
actual
losses
until
after
the
verdict,
and
so
i
agree,
there
is
an
analogy,
but
what's
different
here
is,
there
are
going
to
be
two
verdicts
unless
you
capitulate.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
we
think
we
do,
and
for
this
reason.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
well,
yes.
we
think
it
does
under
the
blockburger
test,
and
we
would
provide
the
analysis
that's
even
more
fundamental
than
blockburger.
let
me
illustrate
it
with
what
occurred
in
this
case,
although
i
would
say
it
may
be
generalized
to
many
cases
just
like
it.
my
clients
were
serving
a
life
sentence
for
conspiracy
to
manufacture
methamphetamine,
and
they
were...
they
suffered
forfeiture
of
all
their
property
for
the
exact
same
activity,
the
same
offense,
the
conspiracy
to--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--it
may
have--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--yes--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--i
quite
agree.
when,
in
blockburger,
you
are
comparing
two
different
offenses,
then
you
compare
their
elements
to
see
if
they
are
functionally
the
same,
or
lesser
included.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
but
in
blockburger
you
have
to
have
two
offenses.
we
don't
have
two
offenses.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
well--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--to
the
extent
that
your
question,
justice
scalia,
is
whether
there
is
a
risk
of
conviction,
that's
correct.
however,
in
ex
parte
lange,
and
as
recently
as
2
weeks
ago
in
rutledge,
it
is
not
whether
there
is
a
conviction
question...
the
$50
assessment
fine
in
rutledge
was
a
punishment,
and
it--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--please.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
it
can,
your
honor,
because
i
would
add--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--it
would
not
be,
because
it
would
be
seen
as
remedial.
it
would
be
the
halper
rare
case
model.
you
would
only
ask,
was
the
fine
excessive?
the
analogy
to
our
case
would
be
some
fine
or
penalty
that
was
traditionally,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
as
congress
intended
it
now--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--it's
a--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--because
it's
a
disgorgement
of
a
profit
in
that
setting,
which
is
not
what
the--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--all
right.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i
misunderstood.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i
understand.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i
would
agree,
then,
the
subsequent
prosecution
for
the
same
offense
would
be
barred.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
it
would
be
a
punishment,
and
a
second
punishment,
or
rather
the
jeopardy
of
the
second
punishment,
yes,
and
under
the
text
of
the
clause,
while
it
does
not
say
punishment
in
its
terms,
the
life
and
limb
phrase
has
been
long
understood
to
mean
a
punishment,
and
the
jeopardy
part
refers
to
risk.
and
so
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
ginsburg,
yes,
the
fine,
if
it's
punishment
followed
by
a
attempt
to
prosecute--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--so
it's--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--it
would
not
be
a
label,
it
would
be
an
analysis
that
leads
to
a
conclusion.
the
analysis
is
austin.
what's
its
historical
basis?
is
it
any
different--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--yes.
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
i
understand--
mr.
jeffry
k.
finer
--i
agree,
and
i
would
use
the
analysis
from
that
one
case,
austin,
because
the
analysis
is
very
workable.
you
first
look
historically,
was
it
historically
used
as
a
sanction...
may
i
finish?
