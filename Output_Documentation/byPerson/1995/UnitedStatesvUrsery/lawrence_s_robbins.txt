mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1991
and
1992,
guy
jerome
ursery
maintained
six
plots
of
marijuana
plants
about
250
to
150
feet
outside
the
premises
of
his
property,
a
10-acre
home
in
rural
michigan.
he
harvested
the
plants,
processed
them,
and
apparently
smoked
them
in
his
house,
and
that
was
his
offense,
and
for
that
offense
of
manufacturing
marijuana...
which,
by
the
way,
does
not
turn
on
whether
it
was
on
another
piece
of
property.
you
can
take
a
look
at
title
21
and
you
will
find
that
it
does
not
turn
in
the
slightest
on
the
fact
that
it
was
on
another
piece
of
property.
for
that
offense,
he
was
first
subjected
to
a
forfeiture
of
half
the
equity
in
his
property
under
881(a)(7),
the
very
statute
this
court
construed
in
austin,
which
permits
the
forfeiture
of
property
used
to
commit
a
narcotics
felony.
and
as
the
parties
were
readying
themselves
for
trial
in
the
civil
forfeiture,
he
was
then
indicted
in
a
single
count
prosecution,
which
again
charged
the
manufacture
of
marijuana,
precisely
the
predicate
in
the
881(a)(7)
forfeiture.
this
time
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
63
months
in
jail.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
civil
forfeiture
under
881(a)(7)
was
punishment,
the
prosecution
was
a
second
punishment,
and
it
was
for
the
same
offense
and
in
a
separate
proceeding,
and
accordingly
was
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and,
in
our
view,
each
and
every
step
of
that
analysis
is
not
only
correct,
but
squarely
controlled
by
this
court's
cases.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
with
all
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
various
items
is
self
distinguishing.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
happy--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
my
view
is
that
a
reading
of
the
case
makes
clear
why
it
doesn't
control
and,
indeed,
has
made
clear
to
this
court
why
it
didn't
control
in
the
cases
that
this
court
has
looked
at
since
that
case
was
decided,
and
after
all,
there
were
a
great
many
cases
cited
in
the
government's
59-page
brief.
we
deal
with
as
many
as
we
thought
were
most
germane,
but--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
no,
i
think
quite
the
contrary.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
revisit
various
items
and
tell
us
whether
it's
distinguishable
or
it's
not,
but
i'm
prepared
to
do
so,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
various
items
tells
us
is
that
where
a
forfeiture,
as
in
various
items,
does
not
turn
in
the
slightest
on
the
innocence
of
the
owner
of
the
property,
then,
in
that
event,
it's
a
civil
forfeiture
which
cannot...
to
which
one
cannot
ascribe
a
punitive
dimension.
but
of
course,
my
statute,
881(a)(7),
has
an
explicit
exception
for
innocent
owners
which
is,
of
course,
the
very
distinction
that
this
court
in
92
buena
vista
avenue
said
makes
this
statute
different
from
the
historical
forfeitures,
including
the
one
that
was
at
issue
in
various
items,
the
very
fact
that
persuaded
this
court
in
austin
to
say
that
881(a)(7)
is
punishment
for
purposes
of
the
eighth
amendment,
something
which
at
common
law
i
think
would
have
been
as
surprising
to
the
framers
as
some
of
the
hypotheticals
suggested
by
the
government.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
let
me
say
that's
not
the
only
distinction.
i
think
that's
one
important
distinction,
one
that
this
court
has
pointed
to
in
several...
in
a
couple
of
its
recent
cases,
but
i
also
think
this--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
no,
actually
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that's
the
complete
answer.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
surely
that
is
a
point
of
distinction.
i...
by
no
means,
however,
is
that
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
statute
punitive.
indeed,
it
was
not...
it
was
only
one
of
several
factors
that
the
austin
court,
in
a
portion
of
its
opinion
that
wasn't
fact
unanimous,
concluded
turned
881(a)(7),
my
statute,
the
statute
under
which
mr.
ursery's
property
was
forfeited,
into
punitive...
into
a
punitive
sanction.
but
apart
from
that,
i
think
it's
also
the
case,
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
may,
that
various
items
was
decided
in
an
era
in
which
the
fiction
of
in
rem
proceedings
was
taken,
if
i
may
say
so,
more
seriously,
and
given
a
sort
of...
a
treatment
that
sort
of
abstracted
away
from
the
fact
that
there
is
a
real
person
whose
property
is
being
taken,
and
i
think
frankly
various
items
might
not
come
out
the
same
way
if
viewed
in
the
light
of
certain
of
this
court's
decisions
since
then
that
have
said--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
you
know,
i
think,
if
i
may,
i
don't
think
bennis
really
turns
on
the
same
fact...
you
know,
the
same
issues
that
are
at
stake
here.
to
me,
bennis
is
a
question
of
whether
the
due
process
clause
requires,
as
a
substantive
matter,
that
an
owner
of
property
have
an
innocent
owner
defense,
and
the
court,
you
know,
hearkening
back
to
the
long
line
of
cases,
said
that
it's
not
required,
but
when
it's
present,
surely
that's
some
indication
that
you
have
a
punitive
sanction.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
again,
let
me
say,
i
am
by
no
means
suggesting
that
that
is
the
only
feature--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--in
the
statute
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--my--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
not...
i
think
the
answer
is
that
881
(a)(7)
has
a
variety
of
features
that
render
it
punitive.
apart
from
innocent
owner,
the
fact
that
it
is
tied
to
the
commission
of
an
offense,
it
embodies
the
word
violation
and,
just
as
this
court
referred
to
in
one
1958
sedan,
where
the
requirement
to
prove
illegality
was
what
persuaded
the
court
in
that
case
to
imply
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
to
an
otherwise
civil
forfeiture,
is
also
present
here.
the
fact
that
the
forfeiture
under
881(a)(7)
has
such
a...
it
has
sort
of
random
relationship
to
the
underlying
harm,
a
point
this
court
made
several
times
in
austin,
the
fact
that
what
you
forfeit
may
bear
only
the
mere...
a
mere
happenstance
relationship
to
the
social
cost...
if
you
have
the
taj
mahal
on
your
property,
it
is
entirely
forfeited,
or
if
you
have
a
hobo's
hovel
on
your
property.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it...
well,
excessive
punishment
is
one
implication,
but
i
think
it
is
also
a
factor
that
historically
has
persuaded
this
court
in
a
variety
of
cases...
u.s.
coin
and
currency,
the
opinion
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
you
know,
again,
if
there
is
a
tie
to
a
criminal
offense,
if
there
is
a
random
relationship
between
the
fine
and
what
your...
what
the
social
costs
are,
this
is
another
barometer
of
what
is
punitive.
the
bottom
line
for
us
is
this--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
my
distinction
is
that
it
is
hard
to
see
how
it
could
be
punishment
for
eighth
amendment
purposes
and
not
punishment
for
fifth
amendment
purposes.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be...
or,
more
to
the
point,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
punitive
for
purposes
of
the
self
incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
but
not
punitive
for
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
these
were,
after
all,
enacted
the
same
day.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
i
understand.
you
mean,
could
you
make
a
distinction
between
what
is
sufficiently
punitive
for
one
constitutional
provision
or
another?
i
think
the
answer
to
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
mm
hmm.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
that's
true,
but
that's
for
the,
i
think
quite
different
reason
that
it
isn't
so
overwhelmingly
punitive--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--as
to
trigger
sixth
amendment--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
of
course,
in
one
1958
sedan
the
court
was
not
called
upon
to
decide
whether
it's
punitive
for
one
purposes
and
not
for
another.
the
only
question
presented
was
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
the
only
question
presented
in
one
1958
sedan
was
a
self
incrimination
question,
but
it
strikes
me
as
really
quite
odd
to
say
that
something
that
we
have...
that
the
court
unanimously
concluded
was
punishment
under
the
excessive
fines
clause
will
not
be
punishment
in
all
relevant
respects--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
justice
ginsburg,
if
i
might,
i
really
do
believe
that
this
is
an
instance
where
a
volume
of
logic
is
actually
better
than
a
page
of--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
certainly
nothing
plain
in
the
text
of
the
opinion.
it
would
be
quite
odd
if
it
were,
but--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--there
is
some...
there
may
be
some--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--daylight
in
footnote
14,
but
if
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes,
i
think...
i
think
you
can
read
the
last
footnote
that
way,
and
obviously
the
government
hangs
its
hat
on
that.
but
i
think
that
if
the
balance
of
the
opinion,
precisely
because
it
looks
at
a
series
of
factors
that
have
always...
and
here
i'd
like
to
recur
to
the
tradition
of
this
court's
decisions
that
have
always
been
regarded
as
appropriate
barometers
of
what
is
punishment?
is
it
tied
to
a
criminal
offense?
does
there...
is
there
an
innocent
ownership?
is
it
disproportionate?
is
there
a
random
relationship--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--yes,
although
i
guess
i
think
for
the
rather
different
reason
that
it's
not
imposed
by
the
government,
and
obviously,
you
know,
individual...
you
know,
individual
citizens,
i
suppose,
with
the
possible
exception
of
keytam
litigation,
cannot
impose
double
jeopardy
on
one
another.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
they
can
be,
and
i
suppose--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
obviously,
in
the
final
analysis,
it's
imposed
by
virtue
of
a
judgment
enforceable
by
a
court,
so
i
suppose
under
a
sort
of
shelley
and
kraemer
analysis
one
would
call
that
state
action,
but
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--and
i
suppose
that
under
halper
there
may
come
a
day
when
it
is
so
wildly
disproportionate
that
the
court
may
ultimately
want
to
revisit
the
question,
but
mercifully,
i
don't
have
to
defend
that
today.
i
have
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
mean,
i
have
the
sufficiently
difficult
burden
of
trying
to
persuade
the
court
that
this
is
punishment
for
all
the
reasons
that
it
unanimously
held
it
was
punishment
in
austin,
and
i
guess,
you
know,
for
want
of
a
better
talisman,
i
recur
to
the
point
that
every
reason
the
court
advanced
for
calling
it
punishment
in
austin
is
present
here.
it's
the
same
statute,
it's
the
same
facts,
and
let
me
say,
my
case
happens
to
illustrate
exactly
why
it's
punishment.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
in
my
view--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--and
i
think
we
can...
i
think
we
meet,
we
amply
meet
the
blockburger
standard,
and
that
a
lot
of
the
arguments
that
i've
heard
this
morning
really
have
nothing
to
do
with
blockburger
at
all.
the
fact
is
that
881(a)(7)
incorporates
precisely
the
antecedent
predicate
act,
because
it
requires
the
proof
of
a
violation.
that
is
the
word
used
by
the
statute.
the
fact
that
you
can
prove
a
forfeiture
by
showing
that
someone
else
did
it
strikes
me
as
ultimately
begging
the
question.
the
question
is,
this
person
has
been
punished
twice,
forfeited
on
the
one
hand,
convicted
and
sentenced
on
the
other,
and
now
the
blockburger
inquiry
is,
was
it
for
the
same
offense,
so
after
all
you
need
to
look,
as
the
court
did
in
whalen,
harris
v.
oklahoma,
and
i
would
suggest
united
states
v.
dixon
as
well,
at
the
elements
and
ask,
are
they
the
same?
the
fact
is,
881(a)(7)
couldn't
be
plainer
that
it
is
embodying
all
of
the
elements
of
the
underlying
violation.
let
me
just
say
again,
the
suggestion
by
the
government
this
morning,
which
i
suspect
they
will
disavow
on
rebuttal,
is
that
somehow
the
manufacturing
charge
required
proof
that
it
was
done
on
a
neighbor's
land.
the
court
can
look
at
the
reproduction
of
the
indictment
in
the
joint
appendix,
as
well
as
the
statute
841(a)--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
it
actually
did
not
charge
a
particular
transaction.
it
charged
on
or
about
a
particular
day--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--which
was,
of
course,
a
day
selected
from
within
the
2-year
period
for
which
he'd
already
had
suffered
a
forfeiture,
so
it's...
i
mean,
it's
not
a
different
day
in
any
meaningful
sense,
and
let
me
say
that
if
you
read
the
record
of
the
forfeiture
proceeding
and
the
prosecution,
you
will
find
that
the
forfeiture
and
the
prosecution
both
turned
on
growing
marijuana
off
the
premises,
processing
and
smoking
it
on
the
premises...
same
facts,
same
theory,
same
witnesses,
same--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
it
sounds
at
that
point,
justice
stevens,
that
one
is
almost
getting
into
the
grady
and
corbin
problem
of
turning
on
particular
pleces
of
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
we
are...
we
are
relying
specifically
on
the
elements,
and
again,
to
go
back
to
a
question
that
justice
scalia
put,
i
believe,
perhaps
to
my
cocounsel,
this
really
is,
in
my
view,
just
like
whalen
and
harris
v.
oklahoma.
yes,
it's
true,
you
could
prove
the
forfeiture
by
showing
a
different
underlying
crime.
you
could
show
money
laundering,
you
could
show
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
but
in
this
case,
what
they
charged
was
forfeiture
based
on
manufacturing,
and
what
they
charged
in
the
indictment
at
joint
appendix
page
28
was
manufacturing
as
an
offense,
and
this
is
in
a
sense
a
compound
crime
that
has
a
variety
of
predicates,
just
as
this
court
said
in
whalen.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
oh,
no,
there
was
no.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
was
a
one
count
manufacturing
indictment,
the
exact
same
allegation
that
constituted
the
predicate
in
the
forfeiture.
let
me
just
say
a
quick
word
about
separate
proceedings,
because
i
really
don't--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
quite
the
opposite.
under
my
argument,
you
absolutely
could.
i
don't...
to
me,
the
fine
is
a
form
of
liquidated
damages
that
probably
take...
i
mean,
again--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
if
it's...
you
know,
if
it's
an
extreme
enough
fine,
i
suppose
it
would
raise
a
question
under
halper
as
to
whether
it
is
so
wildly
disproportionate
that
it
really
is
the
rare
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
again,
i
don't
want
to
beg
the
hypothetical
too
much,
because
in
all
likelihood
the
disbarment
and
disgorgement
is
by
a
state
sovereign
and
the
prosecution
is
by...
if
i
understand
you,
by
the
federal--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--but
if
it's
the
same--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--if
it's
the
same
sovereign,
my
position
is
that
unless
the
fine
is
so
disproportionate
as
to
violate
halper,
it's
a
classic,
it's
a
form
of
liquidated
damages
even
if
it's
not,
you
know,
more...
any
better
than
rough
justice.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you.
