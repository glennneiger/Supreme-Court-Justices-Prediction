what
was
the
judgment
that
the
court...
was
it
a
judgment
that
the
court
affirmed?
the
court
affirmed
the
seventh
circuit,
wasn't
it,
in
chapman?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
what
was
the
judgment?
was
it
set
according
to
just
some
weight
to
the
blotter
paper,
or
full
weight?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
this
a
question
of
a
conviction
and
a
sentence
that
had
been
entered
in
chapman?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
the
position
that
you
are
now
taking,
that
all
the
court
said
was
that
you
give
some
weight,
not
necessarily
full
weight,
to
the
blotter
paper,
then
wouldn't
the
judgment
have
to
have
been
vacated
so
that
it
could
be
modified
to
reflect
something
less
than
full
weight?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
meaning
couldn't
be
plain.
if
the
meaning
was
plain,
it
wouldn't
have
changed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bergerson--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
making
at
least
as
a
fallback
argument
the
suggestion
that
the
court
has
ruled
one
way
in
chapman,
it
should
be
enlightened
but
not
bound
by
what
the
sentencing
commission
has
done,
and
therefore
reconsider
and
modify
chapman?
instead
of
trying
to
make
two
inconsistent
things
consistent,
which
seems
to
be
the
thrust
of
your
argument
up
to
now,
to
say
the
sentencing
commission
thought
about
this,
the
court
ought
to
reconsider?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
find
it
powerfully
hard
to
take
the
term
plain
meaning,
which
should
mean
the
word
means
something
plain,
and
then
say
because
there
was
an
expert
commission
that
gave
this
a
lot
of
study,
then
the
plain
meaning,
the
meaning
that
people,
ordinary
people
would
understand,
changes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
could
if
it
worked
against--
--the
defendant.
--the
defendant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
light...
in
that
light
of
reconsideration,
would
the
4....4
solution
that
the
commission
has
come
to,
would
that
have
been
a
permissible
interpretation
of
the
statute
for
the
court?
let's
assume
that
the
guideline
interpretation
came
first.
the
seventh
circuit
had
dealt
with
the
chapman
issue,
but
this
court
had
not.
enlightened
by
the
guideline,
would
it
have
been
impermissible
interpretation
of
the
mixture
or
substance
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wolfson,
is
this
discussion
academic
to
the
extent
that
there's
nobody
qualified
to
challenge
what
the
commission
has
done
for
the
purpose
of
computing
the
guideline
sentence?
that
is,
you
could
have
said
to
congress,
don't
let
this
one
go
through
because
we
disagree
with
it,
but
you
are
not
equipped
now,
you
have
no
way
of
asking
this
court,
and
you're
not
asking
this
court
to
change
the
commission's
interpretation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
guidelines
did
have
an
impact
to
this
extent.
he
ended
up
with
less--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--than
he
did
when
the
commission
was
interpreting
the
guideline
in
sync
with
the
way
this
court
has
interpreted
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
lot
of
months
difference,
wasn't
there?
