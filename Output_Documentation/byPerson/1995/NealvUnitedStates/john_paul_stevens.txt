but
does
125-dose
test
apply
to
other
drugs
in
the
same
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
was
the
argument
the
court
rejected
in
chapman.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
give
you...
i
hope
it's
not
too
hypothetical.
supposing
that
you
have
a
blotter
on
which
you
normally
drop
a
spot
of
ink,
and
you
can
have
a
blotter
that's
about
4
inches
long,
and
you
see
the
spot
of
ink
on
it.
a
lot
of
the
blotter
is
white,
and
then
there's
a
dark
blue...
you
can
also
have
a
blotter
such
as
we
have
here,
about
3
feet
by
5
feet,
same
drop
of
ink
on
it.
would
it
be
permissible
to
say
that
the
mixture
or
substance
merely
includes
the
discolored
portion
of
the
blotter,
because
the
rest
of
it
isn't
mixed
with
the
ink
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
a
clearly
detectable
amount
in
order
to
qualify,
and
you
can
see...
with
an
ink
blotter,
it's
easy.
you
can
see
how
far
it
is.
but
supposing
it's
lsd,
and
you'd
have
a
huge
blotter
on
the
one
hand
and
a
tiny
blotter
on
the
other.
do
you
think
it's
irrational
to
treat
them
the
same,
even
though
the
amount
of
the
mixture,
the
geographical
scope
of
the
mixture
is
precisely
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
saying
how
much
of
the
mixture
shall
we
count.
justice
john
paul
stevens
really
what
they
tried
to
do
is
take
this
market
approach
to
it,
but
they
still
left
this
substance
still
much
more
heavily
punished
in
terms
of
number
of
doses,
even
under
the
commission's
formula.
