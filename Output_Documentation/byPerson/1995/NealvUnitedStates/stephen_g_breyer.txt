justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
it
exercise
that
power,
assuming
it
had
it?
i
mean,
what's
stopping
me
in
this
at
the
moment
is
it
says,
nonetheless
this
approach
does
not
override
the
applicability
of
mixture
or
substance
for
the
purpose
of
applying
any
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
and
then
it
cites
chapman,
and
then
it
cites
5g1.1(b),
and
in
5g1.1(b)
it
says,
when
a
statutory
minimum
sentence
is
greater
than
the
maximum
guideline,
apply
the
statutory
minimum.
now,
i
know
you
could
find
some
ambiguity
in
that,
but
it's
hard
to
find
more
than
ambiguity,
and
what
it
sounds
as
if
they're
saying
is,
we're
changing
it
for
purposes
of
the
guideline,
but
the
mandatory
minimum
in
the
statute
of
course
trumps
the
guideline,
and
there's
nothing
here
that
suggests
we're
changing
that
in
any
way.
that...
i
mean,
that's
what
i'm
concerned
about
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
i
were
on
the
commission
and
were
doing
this
thing,
which
is
pretty
radical,
trying
to
change
a
case
of
the
supreme
court,
interpreting
a
statute
of
congress,
which
i
can't
remember
an
instance
where
the
commission
would
try
to
do
that,
wouldn't
the
commission
at
least
tell
people
what
they
were
trying
to
do
and
explain
it,
rather
than
putting
a
sentence
in
the
guideline
that
implies
to
an
ordinary
reading
the
contrary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
another
question
that
you
may
have.
i'm
going
to
ask
them
the
same
question,
but
this
is
the
great
mystery
here,
which
is
a
vacuum
to
me,
and
i'd
like
to
try
to
find
out
about
it.
i,
of
course,
think
that
these
things
make
more
sense
than
people
sometimes
think--
[laughter]
--and
one
of
the
efforts
here
and
in
congress
is,
they
don't
make
these
numbers
up.
what
they
do
is,
they
go
to
experts,
particularly
dea,
and
they
say
to
dea,
what
should
we
do
here
to
get
our
intent,
so
there
was
at
some
point
some
representation
from
dea
to
congress
that
would
have
told
them
how
technically
to
write
a
statute
that's
going
to
achieve
a
particular
objective.
but
the
particular
objective
was
to
put
big
guys
and
big
deal
gangs
in
jail
for
5
years
or
10
years,
5
years
medium,
and
less
than
5
years,
itty-bitty,
all
right.
now,
what
is
the
definition
of
this?
did
congress
have
in
mind
that
a
fairly
big-sized
expert,
or
drug
guy,
or
lsd
guy
was
a
person
with
125
doses,
or
a
person
that
was
trying
to
sell
2,500?
now,
that's
a
huge
difference,
and
somebody
on
the
staff
there
would
have
found
out
from
dea
and
there
would
have
been
pamphlets,
and
there
would
have
been
writings
about
whether
the
dangerous
people
were
125-dose
people,
or
2,500-dose
people.
so
you've
looked
into
this.
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
this
is
quite
later.
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
passed,
the
dea
was
going
and
telling
the
commission
and
congress
about
the
same
thing
as
to
how
to
write
it,
and
so
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is,
there
must
be
a
manual
or
something
somewhere
that
refers
us
to
whether
it's
125
doses
that
looks...
defines
a
fairly
big
guy,
or
2,500
doses.
that's
the
key
to
this,
and
what
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
matter
how
you
weigh
it.
what
matters
is
whether
you're
trying
to
put
the
125-dose
guy
in
jail
for
5
years,
or
whether
you're
trying
to
put
the
2,500-dose
guy
in
jail
for
5
years.
you
can
have
any
kind
of
weighing
system
you
want,
do
it
in
a
thousand
different
ways,
but
what's
the
objective?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
i
mean,
you
answer
it
as
you
wish.
i
would
have
thought
there
are
lots
of
statutes
that
govern
the
commission,
and
sometimes
it's
not
possible
to
be
literally
consistent
with
the
policy
underlying
each
of
them,
but
that's
primarily
a
judgment
for
the
commission,
isn't
it,
and
if
it
decided
here
that
this
was
too
tough,
the
mandatory
minimum,
because
of
policies
involving
in
other
statutes,
maybe
it
has
the
statutory
authority
to
do
that,
and
then
leave
the
statute
in
place,
because,
of
course,
it
can't
trump
a
statute.
i
mean,
if
that's...
what
i'm
sort
of
interested
in
here,
though,
is...
look,
does
the
commission
have
some
authority
to
interpret
a
statute
in
the
following
sense.
you
have
a
piece
of
blotter
paper.
there
isn't
chemical
binding
between
every
molecule
on
the
blotter
paper.
suppose
they
throw
lsd
into
the
atlantic
ocean.
you
don't
weigh
the
entire
atlantic
ocean,
so
there
must
be
some...
some
technical
matter
where
the
commission
might,
because
of
its
knowledge,
let
us
know
how
much
of
the
binding
that
takes
place
in
a
matter
of
degree
is
that
portion
of
the
paper
that
should
count,
because
they
would
go
talk
to
the
technical
experts
on
that.
now,
i
guess
in
that
sense
the
commission,
while
it
couldn't
legally
bind
the
courts,
could
tell
the
courts
some
information
that
might
be
relevant
to
them
in
deciding
how
much
to
weigh,
how
much
of
this
piece
of
blotter
paper
is
actually
part
of
the
mixture
or
substance
connected
with
the
lsd.
it
could
do
that,
couldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
so
unusual.
i
take
it
that
the
molecules
of
the
lsd
thrown
into
the
atlantic
ocean
might
be
dispersed
among
yards
and
yards
or
miles
and
miles
of
water,
and
so
there
will
have
to
be
a
point
where
people
will
talk
about
the
concentration
of
the
lsd
interspersed
with
the
other
molecules
that
bring
it
within
the
range,
mixture
or
substance,
and
when
it
makes
that
kind
of
a
decision,
shouldn't
the
courts
and
the
commission
also
take
into
account
the
policy
that
underlies
this
statute,
namely,
how
big
a
guy
congress
wants
to
put
in
jail
for
5
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
agree
with
that,
but
then
that...
this
is
my...
what
i'm
trying
to
lead
up
to
basically
is
the
government
must
have
in
its
file
somewhere
the
information
that
congress
had
in
its
mind,
whether
staff
or
congressmen,
at
the
time
this
statute
was
passed,
and
did
congress
believe
that
they
were
putting
in
prison
for
5
years
people
who
distributed
125
doses
of
lsd,
or
did
they
think
they
were
putting
in
prison
for
5
years
people
who
distributed
2,500
doses
of
lsd?
they
could
have
read
it
in
pamphlets,
they
could
have
talked
to
lsd
people,
maybe
it's
in
hearings,
maybe
it
was
in
memos,
what's
the
answer
to
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
fact
there
is
no
way
to
follow
the
mandatory
minimum
drug
penalties
into
areas
where
they
don't...
i
mean,
all
right.
anyway,
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
this...
what
i...
the
interesting
problem
to
me,
which
i
don't
have
the
answer
to,
is
this
is
a
statute
that
if
you
take
it
literally
it
seems
as
irrational
as
any
that
we've
come
across,
because
it
seems
as
if
somebody
threw
lsd
into
the
atlantic
ocean,
you
would
weigh
the
entire
atlantic
ocean,
and
so
what
is
it...
what
way
is
there
to
interpret
this
statute
that
does
not
produce
in
some
instance
absurd
results?
how
do
you
define
mixture
and
substance
to
avoid
that
very
odd
result?
