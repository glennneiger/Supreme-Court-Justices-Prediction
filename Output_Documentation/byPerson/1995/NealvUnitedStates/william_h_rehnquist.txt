chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-9088,
meirl
gilbert
neal
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
bergerson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--modification
of
the
former,
to
what--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
that
vested
the
sentencing
commission
with
the
authority
to
define
a
term
of
the...
a
statutory
term
differently
than
this
court
defined
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
answer
the
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
we
have
already
defined
the
meaning
of
a
statutory
term
in
chapman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
contrary
to
what
this
court
interpreted
it
as
in
chapman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
can
you
answer
yes
or
no?
you're
describing
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
term
mixture,
and
i'm
asking,
is
that
contrary
to
the
way
this
court
defined
it
in
chapman.
now,
certainly
you
can
explain,
but
you
can
answer
it
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
if
in
a
totally
different
context
this
court
had
said
we
take
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
employee,
in
a
case
that
justice
breyer
wrote
for
the
court
a
few
weeks
ago,
and
then
a
great
convention
of
lexicographers
came
along
and
said,
well,
we
really
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
thing,
and
we
now
think
that
employee
means
something
different,
could
the
next
party
come
along
and
say,
well,
this
case
should
be
modified
because
you
are
wrong
in
deciding
what
employee
meant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
deduce
that
just
from
the
language,
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
a
detectable
amount
of
lsd?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
the
court
described
congress'
approach
as
a
market-oriented
one,
that
may
be
helpful
in
deciding
what
a
word
means,
but
it
doesn't
enable
one
to
simply
apply
the
language
that
congress
has
used
and
say
well,
anything
market-oriented
will
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
know
best
what
congress
intended
to
do
from
the
language
it
chose,
and
it
chose
the
language,
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
a
detectable
amount
of
lsd.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
didn't
establish
the
sentencing
commission
to
amend
the
provisions
of
the
criminal
code.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
criminal
code
remains
what
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
criminal
code
is
not
amended,
then
you
still
have
the
language
to
deal
with,
mixture
or
substance,
and
to
say,
well,
now
we
see
that
mixture
or
substance
means.04
grams
of
something
when
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
like
that,
is
just
a
tremendous
leap.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
mean
we
must
defer
to
the
sentencing
commission
in
defining
the
terms
of
the
criminal
code?
i
thought
we
defined
those.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
saying
it
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
sounds
all
very
well,
but
just
what
exactly
does
it
do?
the
criminal
code
says
one
thing.
it
was
enacted
by
congress,
and
it
uses
some
words.
the
sentencing
commission
now
meets
and
says
that
for
guidelines
purposes
this
means.04
something,
and
then
we
simply
go
back
and
say,
well,
now
we
see
that
the
term
mixture
or
substance
as
congress...
means.04?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
simply
don't
answer
the
questions,
mr.
bergerson.
are
you
through?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing
in
the
submission
of
this
case
raises
any
question
about
the
rationality
of
the
guidelines,
does
it?
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
under
the
provisions
of
chapman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
said
he
should
have
been
sentenced
under
the
guidelines
and
the
district
court
refused
to
do
so,
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
bergerson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bergerson.
the
case
is
submitted.
