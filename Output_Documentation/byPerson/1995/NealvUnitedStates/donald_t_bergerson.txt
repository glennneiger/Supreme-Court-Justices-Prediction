mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1984,
after
10
years
of
careful
study,
congress
responded
to
growing
criticism
of
federal
criminal
justice
systems
by
creating
the
united
states
sentencing
commission.
the
task
of
the
commission
was
to
eliminate
unpredictable,
unequal,
and
unfair
sentences
which
had
marred
federal
criminal
law
for
decades.
to
achieve
this
goal,
the
commission
was
vested
with
broad
factfinding
resources,
staffed
with
jurists
and
leading
experts
in
the
sentencing
field,
and
structured
to
interact
symbiotically
with
the
courts
and
other
branches
of
government
so
as
to
evolve
predictable
and
proportionate
sentencing
practices
throughout
the
federal
courts.
this
case
offers
this
court
an
opportunity
to
define
the
role
of
the
commission
in
such
a
way
as
to
fulfill
the
express
intentions
of
the
congress
which
created
it.
meirl
neal
was
convicted
of
trafficking
in
lsd
in
1989.
section
841(b)
of
title
21
requires
a
mandatory
10-year
penalty
for
trafficking
in
10
or
more
grams
of
a
mixture
of
lsd.
at
the
time
mr.
neal
was
sentenced,
neither
the
sentencing
guideline
nor
the
code
contained
a
definition
of
the
term,
mixture.
in
this
case,
and
under
the
rule
later
announced
by
this
court
in
chapman
v.
united
states,
the
relevant
mixture
was
held
to
consist
of
the
blotter
paper
onto
which
the
lsd
was
placed
for
purposes
of
sale
and
distribution.
under
this
definition,
mr.
neal
received
a
sentence
of
16
years
imprisonment.
four
years
after
mr.
neal
was
sentenced,
the
sentencing
commission
conducted
hearings
on
whether
the
sentencing
practice
used
in
his
case
could
be
reconciled
with
section
841.
the
hearing
was
required
under
the
commission's
1984
enabling
legislation
which
chartered
it
and
made
numerous
reference
to
its
absolute
and
abiding
duty
to
eliminate
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
in
federal
criminal
cases.
congress
equipped
the
commission
with
numerous
tools
to
achieve
this
result.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
yes.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
if
all...
justice
o'connor,
if
all
the
court
had
before
it
were
simply
mr.
neal
coming
up
and
asking
the
court
simply
to
reconsider
chapman
in
the
absence
of
commission
action--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--would
you
reconsider?
no.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
first
of
all,
i
am--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--okay.
i'm
arguing
the
latter,
but
i
also
believe
a
modification
of
the
former
is
the
appropriate
statement
of
my
principle
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
of
the
former
proposition,
which
is
revisiting
chapman.
there
is
no
stare
decisis
problem
in
this--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--i
think
that
the
commission
has--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--i
believe
that
this
court
should
defer
to
the--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--the
answer
is
yes,
justice
o'connor.
i
believe
that
this
court
should
look
to
the
act
of
congress
in
1984
which
vested
the
commission
with
the
duty
and
the
power
to
interpret
terms
and
penalty
statutes
so
as
to
establish--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--i
don't
believe
that
the
sentencing--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--no,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
the
power
to
define
a
statute
in
a
way
different
from
the
way
this
court--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--this
court
in
chapman
held
that
in
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
to
include
blotter
paper
in
the
weighing
of
lsd,
in
answer
to
the
specific
question,
does
mixture
or
substance
refer
to
pure
lsd,
this
court
held
that
one
must
include
the
blotter
paper
because
congress
adopted
a
market-oriented
approach
for
purposes
of
sentencing
under
841.
the
commission
has,
after
thorough
exploration,
factfinding
and
hearings,
reinterpreted
the
term
mixture
in
light
of
the
realities
of
the
market.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
your
honor,
words
like--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--no.
it
is
an
expansion.
this
is
a
second
generation
case.
this
court
in
chapman
held
that
mixture
or
substance
containing
lsd
requires
that
the
paper
be
weighed
in
terms
of
sentencing,
because
the
meaning
of
the
statute
was
to
punish
drugs
as
they
are
sold
in
the
market.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
in
both
cases
the
court
affirmed
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
there
was
language
in
chapman
which
was
not
necessary
to
the
resolution
or
solution
of
the
case
which
said
that
all
the
blotter
paper
should
be
weighed.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
yes.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
no.
in
chapman,
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
the
phrase,
mixture
or
substance,
referred
to
pure
lsd.
the
commission
had
not
yet
spoken
to
the
issue,
nor
had
any
other
agency,
nor
had
congress
spoken,
and
the
term
had
no
fixed
common
law
meaning.
accordingly,
the
court
was
obligated
to
use
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word.
what
we
are
arguing
in
this
case
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
has
changed
in
light
of
the
commission's
thorough
factual
exploration
into
what
that
plain
meaning--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--well,
but
the
meaning
can
change
in
the
context
of
the
statute,
because
the
statute
refers
to
the
drug
market.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
and
that's
what
the
commission
studied,
was
the
drug
market.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
no,
because
there
is
no
congressionally
delegated
convention
of
lexicographers
tasked
with
precisely
the
task
that
you've
outlined
in
your
hypothetical.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
if
congress
designated
a
convention
of
lexicographers
with
the
same
thoroughness
as
it
did--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--the
sentencing
commission,
then
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
case
of
stare
decisis,
and
those
cases
all
deal
with
stare
decisis,
and
it's
not
a
case
of
stare
decisis
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
language
in
chapman
which
is
problematic
here,
the
language
which
talks
about
weighing
all
the
blotter
paper,
was
not
necessary
for
the
resolution
of
the
chapman
case
because
the
question
presented
in
chapman
was
simply
answered
by
saying
that
the
mixture
includes
blotter
paper.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
what
was
at
issue
in
chapman--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--the
length
of
the
sentence
under
the
statute
did.
the
guideline
sentence
in
chapman
was
not
directly
challenged.
it
was
simply
tracking
along
with
the
mandatory--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--the
sentence
in
chapman--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--given
the
two
alternatives--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--yes.
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
souter.
the
sentence
did
depend
on
the
weight
of
the
blotter
paper
entirely
because
no
other
alternative
was
presented.
either
one
had
to
give
mr.
chapman
a
sentence--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--right
at
the
time,
but
now
the
term,
mixture
or
substance,
has
been
revisited
by
the
sentencing
commission
which
was
tasked
with
the
task
of--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--that
is
not
my
position,
justice
souter.
my
position
is
that
the
sentencing
commission
can,
given
the
delegation
that
congress
has
given
to
it,
explore
reality
by
means
of
the
hearings
that
congress
has
tasked
it
to
do
under
section--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--what
is
left
of
the
holding
in
chapman
is
the
essentials
of
section
841,
to
wit
that
there
is
a
market-oriented
approach
to
drug
sentencing,
that
the--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--that
would
be--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--that
has
yielded--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--to
the
new
plain
meaning--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--of
the
term,
and
the
reason
that
it
yields
to
the
new
plain
meaning
of
the
term
is
because
mixture
or
substance,
as
defined
as
gross
weight
blotter
paper,
with
no
input
from
the
sentencing
commission's
expert
study
of
the
issue,
is
inconsistent
with
section
841(b)
as
framed
by
congress.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
it
is
in
fact.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
not
under
the
delegation
that's
been
given
to
the
commission,
justice
scalia,
to
establish
sentencing
guidelines.
the
government
concedes
and
we
agree
that
it--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--however,
the
totally
different
basis
is
entirely
in
keeping
with
the
language
of
the
statute
because
it
punishes
lsd
in
a--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
government
can
go
to
congress
and
ask
congress
to
change
the
sentencing
reform
act
for
1984.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
nonetheless.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
congress
has
given
to
the
sentencing
commission
the
power
to
do
what
it
did
and
reserve
for
itself
the
power
to
do
what
the
chief
justice
is
suggesting.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that
interpretation.
of
course
the
statute
trumps
the
guideline,
and
of
course
the
commission
is
powerless
to
rewrite
the
statute.
however,
what
i
read
the
commission
as
saying
in
that
passage
is
two
things.
first
of
all,
it
is
proclaiming
that
the
guideline
is
consistent
with
the
statute.
it
does
not
override
the
statute
for
purposes
of
setting
a
mandatory
minimum.
second,
in
light
of
the
history,
as
i've
outlined
in
my
reply
brief,
of
this
amendment,
the
commission
is
simply
proclaiming
the
process
by
which
it
reached
its
result.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
well,
the
sentence
is
in
the
commentary
to
the
guideline,
and
to
the
degree
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
guideline
it's
not
binding
on
this
court
under
this
court's
stinson
decision,
but
my
submission
would
be
that
the
guideline
is
plain
enough
and
the
delegation
to
the
commission
to
do
what
it
did
is
plain
enough
that
the
commission
need
not
have
said
anything,
and
simply
proclaiming
that
it
is
trying
to
be
consistent
with
section
841
and
this
court's
reasoning
in
chapman
is
nothing
more
than
the
commission's
own
statement
of
its
own
limitations.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
in
the
chapman
dissent
there
is
a
footnote,
footnote
12,
which
indicates
that
if
you
strip
away
the
paper,
then
the
doses
become
equivalent
for
all
the
drugs
listed
in
section
841(b).
that
led
the
arguers
in
chapman
to
believe
that
it
was
likely
that
congress
simply
did
not
take
into
account
the
paper,
but
that
issue
has
been
decided.
what
we're
saying
now
is
that
the
dea
had
equal
input
into
the
commission's
definition,
and
that
the
commission's
definition
was
done
with
reference
to
all
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
the
dea's
pre-1986
and
post
1986
statements
all
weigh
lsd
in
terms
of
pure
lsd.
that's
the
reference
to
which
they
make--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--in
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
the
dea
did
not
provide
input
to
congress
on
the
question
that
your
honor
has
asked.
the
dea
provided
data
to
congress
on
the
precise
weight
of
pure
lsd.
however,
if
one
looks
at
the
statute
and
construes
it
as
a
whole
in
accordance
with
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
to
punish
these
drugs
in
pari
materia.
the
relevant
language
of
the
statute
is
not
simply
mixture
or
substance,
but
all
the
other
references,
to
10
years,
different
doses,
different
quantities,
absolute
quantities
of
drugs
that
yield
roughly
equivalent
doses,
and
one
assumes
that
the
commission
was
correct
in
interpreting
the
statute
to
mean
that
what
congress
wanted
was
to
go
and
have
lsd
punished
at
roughly
the
same
level
as
the
other
drugs.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
yes.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
that
is
one
position,
your
honor.
i
would
clarify
it
to
say
the
sentencing
commission
did
not
merely
think
about
it
but
studied
the
market
to
such
a
degree
as
to
give
the
words
used
in
the
statute
a
new
plain
meaning
in
the
real
world
and
therefore
this
court--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--yes,
your
honor.
i
will
point
out,
however,
that
the
commission
studied
the
drug
market
to
which
the
statute
directly
pertains
according
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
according
to
the
finding
of
this
court
in
chapman
and,
studying
that
drug
market,
came
up
with
the
definition
it
has
here.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
on
the
record
presented
to
you
in
chapman,
you
could
not,
your
honor,
because
chapman
involved
no
comment
from
the
sentencing
commission,
having
undertaken
expert
study.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
your
honor,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
legislating.
we
submit
that
what
the
commission
did
was
study
the
weights
of
drug
mixtures
in
the
actual--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--what
we
would
submit
is
that--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--well,
the
language
in
question
is
the
statute
as
a
whole,
but
turning
to
mixture
in
the
context
of
the
statute--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--i
would
submit
that
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
lsd
means
that
quantum
of
lsd
which
yield
sentences
consistent
with
the
obvious
intent
of
congress
to
regulate
street
drugs
in
like
quantities
with
like
mandatory
penalties
in
the
form
they're
sold
on
the
market.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
i
deduce
that
from
the
market-oriented
approach
of
the
statute--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--which
is
where
this
court
achieved
its
deduction
in
chapman
as
well.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
what
congress
intended
to
do,
your
honor,
was
to--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--that's
correct,
but
what
congress
intended
to
do
with
that
language
was
to
plug
it
into
the
remainder
of
the
statute,
and
the
remainder
of
the
statute
provides
like
penalties
for
different
amounts
of
drugs
which,
if
interpreted
in
the
manner
done
by
the
commission,
yields
results
consistent
within
the
statute
with
other
drugs--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--your
honor,
this
is
an
evolutionary
process.
the
commission
hadn't
spoken
at
the
time
of
chapman,
although
in
chapman
this
court
looked
to
the
commission
for
guidance
on
the
issue.
had
the
commission--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--chapman
posed
a
different
issue.
reconsidering
the
issue
of
what
mixture
or
substance
means
in
light
of
the
reality
found
by
the
commission
in
its
exploration,
mixture
or
substance
means
what
it
says
in
amendment
488.
it
means.4
milligrams
per
dosage
unit
of
lsd,
so
as
to
cohere
the
statute
amongst
itself--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--and
to
cure
penalties
with
other
penalties
for
like
drugs.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
not
in
a
vacuum,
your
honor,
but
congress
established
the
sentencing
commission
to
do
precisely
what
it
did
here.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
nor
did
it.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
absolutely,
and
that's
why
the
sentencing
commission
proclaimed
that
its
findings
were
consistent
with
chapman
and
with
the
statute.
the
commission
didn't
amend
the
criminal
code.
it
kept
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
in
the
form
that
it
was
intended
by
congress
to
be.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
it
has
always
been
in
the
tradition
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
defer
to
expert
agencies
in
defining
the
realities
of
the--
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
--no.
the
sentencing
commission
did
not
define
the
terms
in
the
criminal
code.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
i'm
saying
that
the
sentencing
commission
has
come
up
with
an
interpretation
of
mixture
or
substance
as
it
exists
in
the
real
drug
markets.
that,
in
turn,
references
back
to
the
criminal
code.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
your
honor,
the
sentencing
commission
did
not
define
the
words
mixture
or
substance.
mr.
donald

my
answer
is
that
the
sentencing
commission
did
not
do
what...
it
did
not
define
the
terms
in
the
statute.
it
gave
an
explanation
of
those
terms
in
the
drug
market
as
it
was
chartered
by
congress
to
study
the
drug
market,
and
it
is
to
the
commission
that
courts
must
look
in
terms
of
seeing
what
those
words
mean
in
the
drug
market
congress
sought
to
regulate
under
section
841.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
t.
bergerson
thank
you.
congress
created
the
sentencing
commission
with
the
idea
of
reconciling
and
eliminating
precisely
the
irrationalities
we
have
now
been
talking
about
for
an
hour,
and
which
we've
been
talking
about
since
the
chapman
case.
the
place
is
to
inform
the
courts
of
the
realities
of
criminal
sentencing,
and
that's
why
this
case
is
before
this
court
now.
the
commission
recognized
in
this
case
by
a
factual
finding
of
great
quality
and
depth
that
the
sentencing
in
lsd
cases
was
irrational
and
not
consistent
with
the
statute
as
it
interpreted
as
a
whole,
but
more
than
that,
it
defined
the
reality
of
what
mixture
or
substance
containing
lsd
means
in
accordance
with
the
market
realities
of
841.
it
didn't
purport
to
overrule
this
court,
and
it
said
it
wasn't
doing
so,
but
it
did
give
a
new
plain
meaning
to
the
word.
this
court
recognized
that
the
commission
had
precisely
this
place
in
the
scheme
of
things.
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
allow
the
commission
to
do
here
what
the
commission
does
all
the
time,
which
is
to
establish
binding
guidelines
for
sentencing
in
criminal
cases.
our
position
is
that.4
milligrams
of
lsd
is
a
mixture
or
substance
containing
lsd
within
the
meaning
of
section
841(b)
in
light
of
the
realities,
and
that
under
this
court's
jurisprudence,
deference
should
be
paid
to
what
the
commission
has
done.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
submit.
