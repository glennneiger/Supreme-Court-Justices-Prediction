justice
antonin
scalia
but
congress
could
do
that.
that's
the
only
thing
lacking,
really,
right?
congress
can
have
this
court
second-guessed
all
the
time.
all
it
has
to
do
is
designate
a
particular
convention
of
lexicographers,
just
as
here
it
designated
a
certain
aggregation
of
judges
and
scholars
who
could
be
commissioners.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
feel
a
lot
less
important
than
i
did
before.
[laughter]
well,
that's
contrary
to
some
of
our
decided
cases,
isn't
it,
that
another
body
could
in
effect
overrule
our
decisions?
in
fact,
it's
contrary
to
that
case
back
in
1790,
the
pension
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bergerson,
not
only
do
i
have
some
doubt
whether
we
have
to
follow
the
sentencing
commission,
i
have
some
doubt
whether
the
sentencing
commission
doesn't
have
to
follow
us.
is
there
any
way
in
which
the
government
can
challenge
the
sentencing
commission
guidelines
as
in
effect
creating
a
skewed
system
in
which
you
get
a
10-year
minimum
on
the
basis
of
our
holding,
and
then
everything
from
there
is
computed
on
a
very
different
basis?
apparently
the
commission
thought
that
was
okay,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
crazy
system.
is
there
any
way
in
which
what
the
commission
says
is
challengeable
as
not
being
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
matter
how
irrational
those
sentencing
guidelines
are?
that
is,
you
have
a
10-year
minimum
based
on
our
holding,
and
then
they
use
a
totally
different
basis
for
deciding
the
increments
of
punishment
above
10
years,
which
seems
to
me
quite
irrational.
justice
antonin
scalia
theirs
is
and
ours
is,
but
you
have
the
two
of
them
working,
and
you
say
the
commission's
ought
to
prevail
over
ours.
if
i
think
that
ours
ought
to
prevail
over
the
commission's,
i
wonder...
but
you
say
there's
no
way
to
set
the
commission
right.
well,
the
government
can
always
go
to
congress
and
ask
that
it
not
approve
the
sentencing
commission's
recommendations,
can't
it,
the
way
it
did
with
this
crack
cocaine
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
doesn't
change
things
just
because
they're
illogical.
[laughter]
i
mean,
that's...
congress
doesn't
care
about
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
do.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
couldn't
possibly
have
interpreted
the
statute
to
mean
anything
resembling
what
the
commission
says
it's
going
to
use
for
purposes
of
sentencing,
could
we?
how
could
you
possibly
get
that
out
of
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
with
a
comment
or
without
a
comment,
we
can't
read,
you
know,
the
word
mixture
to
mean,
you
know,
so
many
doses.
that's
just...
that's
legislating,
it's
not
interpreting
a
text
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
you
have
us
interpret
the
language
in
chapman?
what
is
it
you
think
we
should
have
said
in
chapman
the
relevant
language
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
language
in
question
is
what,
mixture?
justice
antonin
scalia
mm-hmm.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand...
all
i
want
to
know
is
what
you
think
we
should
have
said.
just
tell
me
how
the
opinion
would
have
read
in
chapman
had
you
written
it,
in
light
of,
you
know,
later
developments
at
the
commission.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
listening
to
my
question.
i
just
want
to
know
what
you
think
chapman
should
have...
suppose
we
were
rewriting
chapman
today.
what
should
it
say?
mixture
or
substance
means
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
a
court
can
interpret
mixture
or
substance
to
mean.4
milligram
dosage
of
lsd?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they
do
that?
can
they
just
ignore
our
interpretation
of
what
the
statute
means
in
determining
what
the
penalties
are
going
to
be
under
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
we're
in
a
very
strange
position
here,
where
the
minimum
is
determined,
now
determined
on
the
basis
of
one
theory
and
the
length
of
time
in
prison,
unless
the
minimum
interferes,
is
being
determined
on
a
totally
different
theory.
doesn't
the
commission,
in
drawing
up
its
proposals,
have
to
adhere
to
the
meaning
of
the
law
as
we've
determined
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
plenary.
i
mean,
it's
not
arbitrary
either.
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
arbitrary
decision
by
the
commission?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not...
inconsistency
with
the
criminal
law
whose
penalties
they're
prescribing
doesn't
count.
there's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand,
but
once
the
minimum
applies,
you
agree
that
the
minimum
bears
no
relationship
to
the
rest
of
the
sentencing
scheme.
justice
antonin
scalia
other
than
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
have
to
construct
the
sentences
based
upon
the
meaning
of
the
criminal
law
as
this
court
has
interpreted
the
criminal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
congress
didn't
say
that
explicitly,
but
with
other
agencies
we
certainly
can
say
that
a
particular
rule
made
by
the
agency
produces
such
an
illogical
result
that
it's
arbitrary,
and
therefore...
is
there
any
way
the
commission's
decision
on
these
matters
can
be
reversed
as
being
arbitrary,
as
being
contrary
to
law,
or
whatever
it
says
is
law
automatically?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
thing
it
can
contradict--
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
if
that's
the
law...
you're
saying
whatever
the
commission
does
is
the
law,
then
i
assume
that
the
defendant
who
gets
hit
with
a
mandatory
minimum
in
a
scheme
that's
totally
different
from
the
scheme
that
the
commission
is
using
for
the
rest
of
the
statute,
he
has
that
claim.
it
seems
to
me
either
the
guidelines
or
our
interpretation
of
chapman
denies...
it
puts
somebody
in
a
very
weird
position.
somebody
must
have
a
claim
here,
and
you're
saying
you
can't
challenge
what
the
commission
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
think
that
the
more
mixture
you
got,
the
more
punishment
you'd
get,
and
what
the
commissioner
has
said
is,
no,
that's
not
true,
even
though
we
have
said
the
statute
is
based
on
what
the
mixture
weighs.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
commissioner
said
the
punishment
isn't
going
to
be
based
on
what
the
mixture
weighs.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
depends
on
whether
you
think
the
statute
was
punishing
the
sale
of
mixtures
or
substances
or
whether
it
was
punishing
the
sale
of
hits--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
statute
says
mixture
or
substance,
and
that's
how
we
interpreted
it,
and
i
don't
know
why
the
commission
can
conclude
that
really
congress
was
looking
at...
you
know,
it's
like
the
prohibition
law
that
somehow
it's...
as
far
as
i
was
aware,
it
applied
to
whether
the
liquor
was
40
proof
or
100
proof.
it
didn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
any
mixture,
and
that's
how
we
interpreted
subsection
5
here,
and
i
don't
know
where
the
commission
gets
off
interpreting
it
differently
for
purposes
of
deciding
what
the
incremental
penalties
are.
our
holding
clearly
is
that
section
5,
as
it
says,
applies
to
mixture
or
substance,
and
then
the
commission
comes
in
with
a
sentencing
scheme
that
uses
a
totally
different
criteria
quite
inconsistent
with
our
holding
in
chapman.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
mr.
wolfson,
but
i
have
the
distinct
impression
that
if
any
other
agency
that
i
know
of
interpreted
a
statute
this
way,
that
the
minimum
applies
to
the
mixture
or
substance,
but
the
incremental
penalty
does
not
apply
to
the
mixture
or
substance
but
to
the
number
of
grams
in
the
mixture
or
substance,
we
would
say,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
simply
is...
you
must
be
consistent.
this
is
irrational.
it
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
therefore
the
rule
you've
adopted
is
invalid.
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
would
have
been
nothing
inconsistent
with
any
law,
however.
and
why
concede
that
it's
irrational,
because
after
all,
the
commission
operates
under
a
mandate,
which
is
to
make
sense
of
a
crazy
quilt
of
criminal
punishment
sentences
statutes
which
create
a
crazy
quilt
of
policies
that
one
cannot
live
up
to
each
policy
in
every
area
that
the
statute
doesn't
cover,
right?
that's
their
basic
mandate.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
sells
the
atlantic
ocean
you'd
get
him,
wouldn't
you,
for
the
minimum?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
get
him
for
the
minimum
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
pursue
for
the
minimum,
would
you
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
worried
about
that
happening?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolfson,
my
line
of
inquiry
is
not
academic.
i
seriously
do
not
know
whether
i
can
go
along
with
the
government
if
i
think
that
the
result
of
going
along
with
the
government
is
endorsing
a
system
that
has
such
incompatible
sentences.
it
is
irrational,
to
my
mind,
and
you
are
telling
me
that
there
is
nothing
that
the
government
can
do
about
the
guidelines,
is
that
right,
so
that
my
only
choice
is
to
reinterpret
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
guidelines
can
be
as
inconsistent
as
you
like
with
the
substantive
criminal
statutes,
including
minimums.
is
that
the
government's
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can
they
not
be
unlawful
because
they
are
incompatible
with
the
substantive
criminal
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
have
a
problem
with
me.
if
they
don't
have
to
follow
us,
maybe
we
should
revise
our
law
to
follow
them,
because
otherwise
the
system
in
place
seems
to
me
quite
irrational.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
could
be
irrational.
they
are
entitled
to
be
irrational.
agencies
cannot.
we
have
doctrines
about
arbitrary
and
capricious
agency
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
--he
points
to
somebody
else
who
has
sold
a
whole
lot
more
of
grams
of
the
substance,
and
this
other
person
who's
sold
a
whole
lot
more
still
only
gets
10
years.
