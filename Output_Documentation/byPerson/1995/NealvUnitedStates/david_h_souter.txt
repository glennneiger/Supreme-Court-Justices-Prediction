did
the
length
of
the
sentence
in
chapman
depend
on
the
actual
weight,
including
the
weight
of
the
blotter
paper?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes
or
no.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
answer
is
yes,
the
sentence
depended
on
the
actual
weight
of
the
mixture
or
substance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
answer
is
yes,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
that
was
the
holding
of
the
case.
whether
another
argument
or
another
alternative
might
have
been
presented
is
beside
the
point.
that's
what
the
case
held.
the
entire
weight
will
be
considered
and
the
sentence
will
be
set
accordingly.
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
which
means,
on
your
view,
the
sentencing
commission
can,
in
fact,
modify
the
holding
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
when
reality
has
been
explored,
what
is
left
of
the
holding
in
chapman?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not
the
rule
that
the
actual
weight
will
be
considered.
that's
gone.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
has
yielded
to
reality.
justice
david
h.
souter
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
sure
that
it
matters,
but
when
we're
talking
about
reality,
is
it
correct
to
say,
as
i
think
the
government
has
pointed
out,
that
the
putative
weight
adopted
by
the
commission
is
approximately
1/20th
of
the
characteristic
average
weight?
