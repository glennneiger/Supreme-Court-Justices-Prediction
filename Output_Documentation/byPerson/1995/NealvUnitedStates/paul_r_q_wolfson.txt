mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
chapman
v.
united
states
this
court
held
that
the
actual
weight
of
the
entire
carrier
medium
must
be
used
to
determine
whether
the
defendant
is
subject
to
the
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
statute
for
trafficking
in
lsd,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
rule
was
changed
by
the
sentencing
commission's
new
lsd
guideline,
which
does
not
use
the
actual
weight
of
the
drug
and
the
carrier,
but
instead
uses
a
constructive
weight
for
each
dose
of
lsd
and
calibrates
the
defendant's
sentence
essentially
to
doses
of
lsd.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
not
for
the
purpose
of
determining
what
the
penalties
mean,
are
under
the
statute,
no.
the
sentencing
commission
does
not
have
the
authority
to
construe
terms
in
the
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
statute.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
scalia,
we
don't
argue
that...
leaving
aside
how
the
minimum
applies,
the
sentencing
commission
does
retain
authority
except
for
that
point.
in
other
words,
for
sentences
that
fall
below
the
1-gram
threshold,
the
sentencing
commission
has
its
plenary
authority,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
arbitrary
decision
by
the
commission
if
it
were
inconsistent
with
the
sentencing
reform
act
of
1984,
but
we're
not
taking
the
position--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
for
sentences
that
are
less
than
1
gram,
the
penalty
statute
doesn't
apply,
so
it
doesn't...
the
statute
only
applies
for
1
gram
or
more,
or
10
grams
or
more.
it's
a
two-step
threshold.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
once
the
minimum
applies...
well,
this
court
construed...
construed
chapman,
construed
the
minimum
statute
in
chapman,
and
the
sentencing
commission
cannot...
the
sentencing
commission
does
not
have
the
authority
to
determine
when
the
statute
comes
into
play,
but
other
than
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--other
than
that,
yes--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--congress
did
not
require
the
sentencing
commission
to
use
the
mixture
or
substance
approach
with
respect
to
its
own
guidelines.
now,
it
did
that...
it
did
that
at
the
time
that
chapman
was
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
if
it's
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
statute,
which
is
the
sentencing
reform
act,
then
a
guideline
could
be
invalid,
but
it
cannot
be--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
cannot
be
challenged...
it
cannot
be
challenged
on
the
basis
that
it
is...
on
this
basis
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
mandatory
minimum
statute,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--if
it
were...
yes.
if
it
were
wholly
arbitrary
enough
to
deny
the
defendant
due
process,
but
i...
that
simply
is
not
the
case...
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
what
the
commission
did
within
its
own
bounds,
the
guideline
is
certainly
valid,
and
it
has
the
effect
of
considerably
lowering
the
sentences
for
lsd
trafficking
both
below
the
1-gram
threshold
and
between...
between
the
1
and
10-gram
threshold
it
brings
most
of
them
down
to
5
years,
and
then
above
the
10-gram
threshold
it
brings
many
sentences
down.
now,
within
the
confines
of
its
authority,
we
believe
that
the
guideline
is
valid,
but
the
commission
does
not
have
the
authority
to
determine
or
to
redetermine,
because
it
would
require
a
reexamination
of
this
court's
decision
in
chapman,
when
those
statutes
are
triggered,
and
congress
did
not
delegate
to
the
commission
the
authority
to
determine
when
the
mandatory
minimum
sentencing
statute
applies.
and
even
if
it
were
otherwise,
the...
our
position
is
there's
no
way
that
you
can...
that
the
commission...
the
commission's
new
lsd
guideline,
the
approach
that
it
takes
to
sentences
for
trafficking
in
lsd
is
not
consistent
with
the
court's
definitive
construction
of
the
statute
in
chapman.
in
chapman,
the
court
construed
the
terms
that
were
in
the
statute,
mixture
or
substance,
and
it
used
traditional
tools
of
statutory
interpretation
to
arrive
at
its
construction.
it
looked
at
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
words
that
were
in
the
statute.
it
invoked
the
canon
of
interpretation
that
every
word
in
the
statute
has
to
be
given
effect
wherever
possible,
and
as
a
result
it
concluded
that
so
long
as
it
contains
a
detectable
amount,
the
entire
mixture
or
substance
is
to
be
weighed
when
determining
whether
a
defendant
is
subject
to
those
statutory
penalties.
now,
the
new
guideline
really
is
not
consistent
with
that
approach.
the
two
approaches
are
not
the
same
at
all,
because
the
new
guideline--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that
is
correct.
the
statute
is
based
on--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
guess--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--justice
breyer,
i...
the
commission's
information
could
be
useful
to
the
court,
but
the
task
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
a
pure
one
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
is
this...
in
the
indication...
in
an
unusual
situation
where
there
is
doubt
as
to
whether
something
is
a
mixture
or
substance,
that
fundamentally
is
a
question
of--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
courts
take
into
account
the
objective
the
congress
was
seeking
to
accomplish
when
it
enacted
the
statute
when
it
gives
content
to
the
terms,
and
whether
it
considers
whether
a
result
in
a
particular
case
is
demonstrably
at
odds
with
what
congress
intended,
and
comment
by
the
commission
can
be
useful
to
the
court.
it
can
help
the
court
understand
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
something
was
or
was
not
an
intent
that
congress
intended,
but
it
is
not
deference
in
the
sense
that
this
court
conventionally
uses
that
term
as
a
presumptively
binding
interpretation
of
a
statute
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
that
it
is
unreasonable.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
breyer,
i
have
to
say
i
do
not
know
of
the
pamphlet
that
you
are
looking
for.
i
will
say
that
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
anti-drug
abuse
act
of
1986,
there
is
a
comment
that
the
5-year
penalty
is
intended
for
the
people
who
keep
the
street
market
going.
the
10-year
is
intended
for
the
people
higher
up
the
chain,
the
5-year
in
general
is
for
the
people
who
keep
the
street
market
going,
the
people
who
fill
the
vials,
who
pass
out
the
baggies,
that
sort
of
thing.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
implausible
that
120,
even
125
doses
of
lsd
could
answer
to
that
description.
that's
a...
that
is
certainly
somebody
who
is
keeping
the
street
market
going,
and
that
is...
congress
could
definitely
conclude
that
that
was
somebody
who
would
warrant
5
years.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
stevens,
i
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
doses
for
lsd
that
bring
into
play
the
5
and
10-year
penalties
are
less
than...
are
lesser,
fewer,
rather,
than
they
are
for
other
drugs,
but
of
course,
that
was
before
the
court
in
chapman--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that
was
before
the
court
in
chapman,
and
essentially
i
think
the
petitioner
is
left
with
urging
the
same
arguments
and
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
chapman.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no.
justice
ginsburg,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is...
even
if
the
question
were
still
open
in
chapman,
or
if
the
court
were
reconsidering
the
matter,
this
is
not
a
permissible
interpretation
of
the
statute
because
the
only
reasonable
reading
of
the
statute
i
think
is
an
actual...
the
actual
weight
of
an
actual
mixture
or
substance.
the
statute
says
1
gram
or
more
of
a
mixture
or
substance.
it
does
not
refer
to
hypothetical
abstract
or
constructive
weight,
constructive--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
there
are
situations
in
which,
because
mixture
means
a
situation
in
which
the
molecules
are
interspersed
or
distributed--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--among
another,
and
that's
how
the
court
interpreted
mixture
in
chapman.
there
could
be
very
extreme
situations
in
which
an
infinitesimal
amount
of
a
substance
is
mixed,
but
that's
certainly
not
this
case--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
there
are
situations
where
you
could
exclude
the
99
percent
of
unmixed
blotter
paper,
but
that
is
not,
i
must
emphasize,
what
the
commission
was
doing,
and
i
have
to
say
i
think
it
is...
i
do
not
think
it
is
correct
to
say
that
the
commission
was
really
defining
or
considering
what
is
a
mixture,
or
what
is
a
mixture
or
substance.
i
don't
think
that
is
really
what
the
commission
was
doing.
it's
true
that
they
used
the...
they
kept
in
place
the
drug
quantity
table
for
purposes
of
convenience,
and
they
used
language
referring
to
mixture
or
substance
except
as
otherwise
provided,
but
really
what
they
were
doing
was
putting...
setting
aside,
departing
from
a
system
of
sentencing
based
on
the
weight
of
the
substance
and
relying,
and
adopting
a
scheme
based
on
sentencing
calibrated
to
the
number
of
doses
distributed.
now,
it's
true
that
for
purposes
of
convenience
they
assigned
to
each
dose
a
particular
weight,
and
that
i
think
was
just
so
they
wouldn't
have
to
write
a
new
drug
quantity
table
solely
for
lsd,
because
they
had
in
place
this
useful
system.
but
i
think
it's
wrong
even
to
say
that
the
sentencing
commission
was
reconsidering
what
is
a
mixture,
they
really
were
just
adopting
a
new--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
i...
not
how
much
of
any
actual
mixture.
they
were...
in
other
words,
they
weren't
saying,
take
a
piece
of
blotter
paper
and
arrive
at
some
reasonable
judgment
of
how
much
is
soaked
with
lsd.
they
didn't
even
do
that,
and
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
commission
believed
that
it
was
bringing
the
penalties
roughly
in
line
with
other
substances,
including
pcp,
making
it
punished
slightly
less
than
pcp
because
it
believed
that
ought
to
be
the
case,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
statute
was--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that
is
correct,
and
that
was
the
original
approach
under
the
1970
controlled
substances
act,
that
substances
were
punished.
it
was
any
mixture
or
substance
containing
whatever--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
the
commission
was
purporting
to
say
when
did
the
statute
apply.
they
were
drawing
up
their
own
system,
but
they...
i
do
not
think...
there's
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
what
does
the
background
commentary
mean,
where
it
says
this
approach
does
not
override
the
applicability
of
mixture
or
substance,
see
chapman
and
5g1.1(b).
i
think
what
that
indicates
is
the
commission
recognized
that
chapman
and
the
binding
force
of
section
841
were
controlling.
it
could
not
overturn
that,
and
5g1.1(b)
clearly
indicates
that
where
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
statute
and
the
guideline
sentencing
range,
the
statute
controls
in
every
case.
however,
when
you
read
what
the
commission
did,
they
were
not
deciding
when
did
the
5-year
and
when
did
the
10-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence
come
into
play.
they
were
setting...
and
so
i
don't
think
you
even
get
past
the
threshold,
which
is,
they
were
not
purporting
to
overrule
chapman
or
decide
when
the
statute
applies.
they
were
setting
up
their
own--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
of
course--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
of
course,
had
there
been
no
sentencing
commission
at
all,
had
this
just
been
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
judges,
as
it
was
before...
of
course,
there
wasn't
any
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
but
had
there
just
been
mandatory
minimum
statutes
and
pure
discretion
of
the
district
judges,
the
district
judges
could
have
sentenced
all
offenders
who
came
within
the
reach
of
the
statute
at
the
low
end--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
certainly--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
certainly
don't
believe
that
there
was
an
irrational
result,
and
the
petitioner
had--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--we
are
certainly
not
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
the
guidelines
are
invalid,
the
guideline
sentencing
range
are
invalid,
even
after--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
first,
this
is
clearly
not
a
case
where...
a
case
like
that.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
would
have
to--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
i
would
expect
to
be
rebuffed.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
think...
i
think
that
congress
can
certainly
write
a
statute
for
the
majority
of
the
cases,
and
that's
what
congress
has
done
here.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no,
the
government
has...
in
other
cases,
the
government...
there
are
cases
currently
going
on
in
the
federal
system
where
the
government
is
challenging
the
validity
of
a
guideline,
not
as
inconsistent
with...
not
as
inconsistent
with
a
separate
penalty
statute--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that
the
sentencing
commission
does
not
have
authority
to
construe,
but
as
inconsistent
with
provisions
of
the
sentencing
reform
act.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
if
they
are
inconsistent
in
the
sense...
if
they
are
inconsistent
in
the
sense
that
they
interfere
with
the
ability
of
the
minimums
to
apply,
obviously
not,
but
if
they
are
within
the
sentencing
commission's
own
sphere,
own
domain,
as
is
the
case
with
less
than
1
gram
here,
that
that...
the
sentencing
commission
is
not--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--because
the
sentencing
commission
is
not
under
a
statutory
obligation
to
bring
those
guidelines
into
conformity
with
the...
with
841(b)
for
offenses
that
don't
meet
the
threshold
for
that
statute
to
apply.
the
sentencing
commission
is
following
its
general
authority
under--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
now,
justice
scalia,
let
me
point
out
that,
of
course,
congress
could
have
decriminalized
lsd
altogether
under
1
gram.
there
could
be
no
penalty,
and...
or
congress
could
have
said,
for
1
gram
or
less,
we
simply
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
federal
concern,
and
we'll
leave
it
up
to
the
states
to
punish.
now,
there
would
be
nothing--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
on
its
own
terms,
of
course,
there's...
what
the
sentencing
commission
has
done,
the
scheme
that
they
have
set
up
is
not
arbitrary.
it's
appropriate
to
base...
we
would
agree
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
base
a
sentencing
scheme
on
doses
of
lsd,
but
it's
not
arbitrary
and
capricious,
but
neither
is
it
contrary
to
law,
because
it
does
not
run
up
against
any
limit
on
the
sentencing
commission's
authority
to
set--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that
is
correct,
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
and
we
agreed--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
it
was
i
think
almost
5
years,
5
or
6
years
difference
in
his
sentence,
and
we
agreed
to
that
extent,
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
reduction
in
his
sentence
down
to
120
months.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
of
course,
congress
could
have
adopted
a
determinate

approach
as
well.
this
again
was
before
the
court
in
chapman,
and
had
congress
said,
if
you
sell
10
grams
or
more
of
a
mixture
or
substance
for
lsd,
you
get
10
years,
no...
you
know,
no...
nothing
higher,
nothing
lower.
that's
a...
it's
a
completely
determinate
sentence.
that
would
be
rational,
and
that
was
a
system
in
sentencing
that
was
common
in
this
country
until
a
generation
or
so
ago.

two
things.
certainly
during
the
180-day
period
we
could
go
to
congress
and
ask
congress--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--in
another...
in
a
case
involving
a
different
issue,
we...
the
attorney
general
has
instructed
the
u.s.
attorneys
to
oppose
application
of
a
guideline
in
particular
cases
and
to
appeal
sentences
if
they're
based
on
the
guidelines,
because
in
that
case
we
believe
they're
inconsistent
with
the
sentencing
reform
act.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
would
say
contrary
to
law,
is
how
i
would
describe
it.
mr.

r.
q.
wolfson
well,
in
that
case--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
in
another
case
we...
it's
our
position
that
there's
a
statute
that
requires...
it
requires
the
sentencing
commission
to
base
guidelines
on
a...
the
highest
available
sentence
under
a
statute,
and
the
question
is
whether
that...
if
i
have
it
correctly,
whether
that
involves...
the
calculation
has
to
be
made
with--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--counting
prior
convictions
or
not.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
in
that
case
we
think
there's
only
one
possible
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
in
sum,
as
earlier,
we
argued
that
the
chapman
rule
remains
the
controlling
interpretation
of
section
841,
and
we
would
request
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
