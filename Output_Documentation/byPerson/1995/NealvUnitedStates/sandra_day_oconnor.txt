mr.
bergerson--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
all
we
had
before
us
were
the
facts
in
this
case
and
this
court's
chapman
interpretation
of
the
statute,
would
we
consider
the
weight
of
the
blotter
paper?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
didn't...
are
you
asking
that
we
now
overturn
chapman
to
reach
the
result,
or
are
you
arguing
that
you
can
leave
chapman
where
it
is
but
the
sentencing
guidelines
changes
means
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
differently?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
do
you
think
that
the
commission
has
power
to
redefine
statutory
terms
that
this
court
has
already
defined?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
we
should
defer
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
answer
yes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wolfson,
if
the
government
did
think
that
what
the
guidelines...
what
the
sentencing
commission
did
in
adopting
a
particular
guideline
was
irrational
in
light
of
the
statutory
language
and
the
scheme
that's
in
place,
exactly
what
is
it
that
the
government
can
do
to
challenge
it?
you
can
tell
congress
when
they're
looking
at
the
guidelines
that
you
don't
think
it
should
be
allowed
to
go
into
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
failing
that,
if
that
is
not
done,
you
just
were
asleep
at
the
switch
over
there
in
looking
at
it,
what
later
could
you
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
with
the
statute,
and
therefore
irrational
and
arbitrary
and
invalid.
