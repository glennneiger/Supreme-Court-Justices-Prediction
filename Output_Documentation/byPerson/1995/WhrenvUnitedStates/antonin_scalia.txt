justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
unite
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
on
the
19th
in
june
1993,
petitioner's
truck
was
stop
by
plainclothes
officers
of
the
district
of
columbia
police
vice
squad.
ostensibly
the
officer’s
purpose
in
approaching
the
truck
was
to
issue
warnings
about
driving
violations.
the
truck
had
turned
without
signaling
and
had
driven
off
at
what
the
officers
considered
an
unreasonable
rate
of
speed.
but
as
the
officers
step
up
to
the
driver
side
window,
they
immediately
observed
two
large
plastic
bags
of
what
appeared
to
be
crack
cocaine
inside
the
truck.
petitioners
were
arrested
and
were
convicted
of
various
federal
narcotics
offenses.
their
argument
here
is
that
the
drug
evidence
should
not
have
been
admitted
at
trial
because
the
vice-squad
officer's
asserted
ground
for
approaching
the
vehicle
plainly
to
give
warnings
about
traffic
violations
or
simply
a
pre-test
for
investigating
unfounded
suspicions
of
drug-dealing
activity.
the
fourth
amendment
guarantees
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secured
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
as
interpreted
by
this
court
that
provision
requires
that
before
the
police
may
cease
a
motorist
even
if
only
for
a
brief
period
and
a
limited
purpose
they
must
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
or
at
least
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
unlawful
activity.
petitioners
do
not
dispute
that
the
police
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
have
violated
the
dc
traffic
code.
instead
they
advance
a
new
argument
that
in
the
unique
context
of
civil
traffic
regulation,
probable
cause
is
simply
not
enough.
automobile
use
they
say
is
so
heavily
and
minutely
regulated
that
total
compliance
is
nearly
impossible.
almost
all
motorists
frequently
commit
technical
violation.
the
danger
of
approving
all
traffic
stops
based
on
probable
cause
they
claimed
is
that
it
creates
the
temptation
for
the
police
to
use
traffic
stops
as
a
means
of
investigating
other
law
violations
as
to
which
no
probable
cause
exist
and
enables
the
place
to
single-out
disfavored
groups
or
unwelcome
police
attention.
for
this
reason,
petitioners
argue,
the
fourth
amendment
test
for
traffic
stop
should
be
not
simply
whether
probable
cause
existed
to
justify
the
stop
but
rather
whether
a
police
officer
acting
reasonably
would
have
made
the
stop
for
the
reason
given.
in
earlier
cases,
we
have
effectively
rejected
the
notion
that
the
constitutionality
of
traffic
stops
depends
upon
the
actual
motivations
of
the
individual
officers
involved.
petitioners
insist
however
that
the
standard
they
have
put
forward
is
an
objective
one,
whether
the
offices
conduct
in
executing
the
traffic
stop
deviated
materially
to
usual
police
practices,
so
the
reasonable
officer
in
the
same
circumstance
would
not
have
made
the
stop
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
traffic
code.
but
although
framed
in
empirical
terms
the
standard
seems
to
what
plainly
driven
by
subjective
considerations,
its
whole
purpose
is
to
prevent
the
police
from
doing
under
the
drives
of
enforcing
the
traffic
code
or
they
would
like
to
do
for
different
reasons.
petitioners
approach
of
using
the
objective
criterion
of
customary
police
practice
as
a
means
of
sorting
out
improper
motivation
might
make
sense
if
our
earlier
cases
rejecting
subjective
and
candidly
criterion
or
based
only
upon
the
evidentiary
difficulty
of
proving
it
but
they
were
not.
they
reflect
primary
the
consideration
of
the
fourth
amendment’s
concern
with
reasonableness
allows
certain
action
to
be
taken
in
certain
circumstances
whatever
the
subjective
intent.
moreover,
even
if
our
concern
had
been
only
an
evidentiary
one,
petitioner’s
proposal
would
by
no
means
dissuade
it.
indeed,
it
seems
to
work
somewhat
easier
to
figure
out
the
intent
of
an
individual
officer
than
to
plum
the
collective
consciousness
of
law
enforcement
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
been
moved
to
act
upon
a
given
traffic
violation.
ordinarily,
the
court
would
be
reduced
to
speculating
about
the
hypothetical
reaction
of
a
hypothetical
constable
and
exercise
that
might
be
called
virtual
subjectivity.
finally,
petitioners
argue
that
the
balancing
inherent
in
any
fourth
amendment
inquiry
requires
us
to
weigh
the
governmental
and
individual
interests
implicated
in
the
traffic
stops
such
as
we
have
here.
but
while
it
is
of
course
true
that
in
principle
every
fourth
amendment
case
since
it
turns
upon
a
reasonableness
determination
involves
a
balancing
of
all
relevant
factors.
as
a
general
rule,
the
result
of
that
balancing
is
not
in
doubt
where
the
search
or
seizure
is
based
upon
probable
cause.
where
probable
cause
have
existed,
the
only
case
in
which
we
have
found
it
necessary
actually
to
perform
the
balancing
analysis
involved
searches
and
seizures
conducted
in
an
extraordinary
manner
unusually
harmful
or
intrusive,
such
as
for
example
seizure
by
means
of
deadly
force
or
unannounced
entry
into
a
home
because
the
making
of
a
routine
traffic
stop
by
a
plainclothes
officer
does
not
even
remotely
qualify
as
such
an
extreme
practice.
it
is
governed
by
the
usual
rule
that
probable
cause
to
believe
the
law
has
been
broken
outbalances
private
interest
in
avoiding
police
contact.
we
accordingly
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
sustaining
petitioner’s
convictions.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
