ms.
lisa
burget
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
question
about
when
seizures
of
motorists
are
unreasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
in
the
government's
view,
probable
cause
of
any
traffic
infraction
is
a
floor
above
which
it
is
per
se
reasonable
to
stop
any
motorist,
but
the
ultimate
test
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
reasonableness,
not
probable
cause,
and
given
the
potential
for
abuse
of
a
mere
probable
cause
standard
in
the
traffic
enforcement
context,
we
believe
that
the
probable
cause
standard
does
not
automatically
strike
the
appropriate
balance
in
each
and
every
case.
to
contrast
our
position
in
concrete
terms,
if
the
floor
represents
probable
cause,
or
the
string
hanging
from
the
motorist's
rear
view
mirror,
or
probable
cause
that
the
motorist
glanced
at
his
watch
or
changed
the
radio
station,
or
probable
cause
that
the
motorist
signaled
for
only
2-1/2
seconds
rather
than
3
seconds
before
changing
lanes,
and
the
ceiling
is
probable
cause
is
the
most
serious
traffic
infraction
we
can
imagine,
then
under
the
government's
view,
the
police
have
complete
discretion
anywhere
between
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
to
make
a
stop.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
if--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--i
think
that
if
there
is
a
policy
that
takes
in...
that
incorporates
those
sorts
of
concerns,
what
car
the
officer
is
in,
or
how
the
officer's
dressed,
then
i
think
they
are
relevant,
because
the
officer,
under
our
view,
would
have
to
comply
with
the
departmental
policies.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
departmental,
or
possibly
even
within
their
district.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
if
there
was
a
policy
that
said
that
traffic
stops
were
not
ever
to
be
made
by
plainclothes
officers,
yes,
we
think
that
would--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
standard
practice,
in
essence
the
department
has
a
policy
of
following
that
practice.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
practice,
correct,
in
the
first--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--that
would--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--that
is
correct,
theoretically
a
citizen
would
have--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--a
civil
suit,
but
i
think
we're
talking
about
an
extremely
small
number
of
cases
where
this
is
going
to
happen,
because
the
sort
of
discretion
that's
granted
even
under
the
would-have
test
is
quite
large.
we
just
set
the
threshold
at
the
level
at
which
there's
probable
cause
of
a
violation
that
is...
that
the
police
are
authorized
to
and
do,
in
fact,
enforce.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well,
i
think
an
analogy
might
be
inventory
cases,
or
drug-testing
cases
where
the
court
has
relied
on
standard
practice
and
policy
in
order
to
control
the
discretion
if
in
brignoni
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
random
drawing
every
week
to
determine
which
students
would
be
tested,
and
if
it
turned
out
that
that's
not
what
they
were
doing,
and
they
were
selecting
students
contrary
to
that
policy,
i
think
those
students,
whether
anything...
evidence
was
turned
up
or
not
might--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
i
think
that's
already
what
in
effect
is
happening.
it's
just
recognizing
the
reality
that
if
this
is
the
practice,
then
this
is
the
standard
practice
and
the
police
need
to
stick
within
that
standard
practice
in
order
to
have
their--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
it's
not
that
it's
repealed,
of
course,
and
they
can
change
their
policy
or
practice
any
time,
but
there's
no...
the
notion
of
full
enforcement
is
really...
there
is
no...
it's
not
even
a
myth
any
more.
nobody
believes
that
there's
such
a
thing
as
full
enforcement.
the
legislature
doesn't
fund
the
police
department
to
do
full
enforcement,
so
it's
understood
by
the
legislature
that
there
will
be
some
selectivity
in
policy,
and
the
notion
that...
all
we're
saying
as
far
as
the
civil
remedy...
i
don't
think
there's
anything
unusual
about
the
idea
that
when
police
act
unreasonably,
which
by
definition
they
are
in
our
situation,
that
they--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--correct.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well,
the
department
has
mandated
that
traffic
enforcement
shall
not
be
undertaken
by
officers
in
unmarked
cars
or
in
plain
clothes
unless
there's
an
immediate
threat
to
the
public
safety
posed
by
the
violation,
essentially
one
that
would
outweigh
the
danger
that's
being
posed
by
a
stop
by
an
unmarked
car.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
correct.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well,
if
the
police
are
not
required
to
constrain
their
own
discretion
by
maintaining
adherence
to
their
own
policies,
then
because
of
the
unique
nature
of
civil
traffic
enforcement,
and
traffic
enforcement
in
general,
they
will
have
the
same
amount
of
discretion
as
a
practical
matter
as
this
court
found
improper
in
prouse
and
unconstitutional
in
prouse,
and
that's
why
there
has
to--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
it's
our
position
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
police
really
have
the
same
discretion
in
the
civil
traffic
area,
and
i
don't
read
the--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
it
would...
obviously,
the
conduct
would
be
judged
by
whichever
policies
govern
the
particular
officer,
whatever
department
he
was
in,
and
so
just
as
in
florida
v.
wells,
you
know,
opening
a
particular
container
might
be
permissible--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--i
think
that's
correct,
assuming
there
were
not
other
policies
that
prohibited
this
particular
kind
of
stop.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well,
i
think
that's
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
florida
v.
wells,
that
a
container
can
be
opened
in
one
jurisdiction
if
there
are
policies
governing
that,
but
not
in
another.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
yes,
it
would,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
very
difficult.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
not
necessarily.
i
mean,
i
think
that
in
most
cases
the
issue
will
be
resolved
with
the
officer
who
made
the
stop
on
the
stand.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
correct.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well,
it
would
depend
on
what
the
policy
was
as
to
uniformed,
marked
patrol
cars.
there
would
be
a
possibility
that
for
the
particular
violations,
or
in
the
particular
circumstances,
that
would
also
be
a
deviation
from
policy.
if
the
violation
was
a
string--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
not
if
there
is
a
policy
that
would
prohibit
or
would...
would
prohibit
the
marked
car
from
making
a
stop,
if,
for
example,
the
violation
was
a
string
hanging
from
the
rear
view
mirror
and
the
police
department
had
a
policy
that
said,
you
shall
enforce
the
regulation
about
objects
hanging
from
the
mirror
only
if
it
is
obstructing
the
view
of
the
driver.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
i
think...
we
don't
have
a
record
on
that.
there's
a
possibility
that
if
we
were
to
look
into
the
practice
with
respect
to
marked
cars
in
the
district,
that
this
would
violate
that
policy,
but
you
know,
we
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
certainly
we're
talking
about
situations
that
are
the
most
egregious
laws
that
are
virtually
never
enforced,
or
are
unenforced,
or
the
officers
aren't
authorized,
so--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--i
think
that
if
we
could
make
a
proffer,
that
we
could
establish
that
his
practice
was
not
representative,
or
that
there
was
a
practice,
a
judge
would
let
us
do
it.
i
don't
think
that's
going
to
be
happening
in
most
of
the
cases.
it
would
only
happen
if
the
officer
happens
to
be
one
of
those
officers
who
is
not
doing
what
everyone
else
is
doing.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
we're
going
to
want
to
try,
but
i
think
that
this
court
can
be
sure
that
judges
aren't
going
to
permit
fishing
expeditions
any
more
than
they
do
in
any
other
area,
that
the
judge
will
use
good
judgment
in
deciding
what's
needed
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
issue
and
figure
out
what
is
the
department
policy?
was
this
a
deviation
so
gross
as
to
make
the
stop
objectively
unreasonable,
and
to
make--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--i
think
that's
right,
because
police
have
to
have
discretion
to
work
within
a
range
of
conduct.
we're
talking
about
a
threshold
that's
just
really
just
a
little
above
probable
cause.
it's
not
probable
cause
of
anything,
it's
probable
cause
of
something
that
they're
actually
authorized
to
enforce
and
do
in
fact
enforce
in
the
circumstances,
and
it
would
depend--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
unreasonable
is
deviating
from
the
policies
that
govern
your
conduct.
i
mean,
in
some
jurisdictions--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--it
could
be--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
there
are
standard
practices.
i
mean,
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
that
a
department
does
not
have
the
ability
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
simply
say,
we
are
not
going
to
act
in
any
rational
fashion,
we're
not
going
to
constrain
our
discretion,
we
want
to
be,
arbitrarily
want
to
take
every
smidgeon
of
discretion
that's
given
to
us
by
the
probable
cause
standard.
we
refuse
to
be
limited.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
that's
our
position.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
i--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
for
the
same
reason
in
wells
a
container
opening
can
vary,
and
even
taking
it
back
farther
from
the
policy,
in
some
jurisdictions
it's
legal
to
turn
right
on
red,
in
other
jurisdictions
it's
not.
stopping
someone
in
one
jurisdiction
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
stopping
them
in
another
is
not.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well,
i
think
you
do
have
to
put
the
reasonable
officer
in
the
shoes
of
the
officer
who's
actually
making
the
stop.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
i
think
so.
if
that's
the
practice
at
that
time
and
under
those
conditions,
then
i
think
that
would
be--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
that's
where
the
standard
practice
i
think
comes
in
as
sort
of
a
backup.
i
mean,
you
can't
have--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
if
they
really
had
the
time
and
resources
to
actually
enforce
these
trivial
violations
and
actually--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--i
think
you
cannot
have
a
token...
a
token
enforcement
policy.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
if
they
in
fact
do
do
it
when
they're
not
busy,
yes,
we
do.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well,
i
don't...
i
think
so,
because
as
a
practical
matter
the
kind
of
violations
we're
talking
about
are
so...
so
petty,
and
they're
seized
upon
in
such
unusual
circumstances
that
it's
going
to
be
clear
to
a
judge
that
this
is
not...
this
is
outside
the--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--there
is
a
split
in
the
states
as
well.
i
think
the
nacdl
brief
gives
a
pretty
good
breakdown
of
the
split.
there
are
several
supreme
courts
of
states,
three
or
four,
i
think,
that
have
adopted
the
would-have,
and
the
many
intermediate
appellate
states
and
it's
not
in
my
understanding
that
there
have
been...
and
the
government
in
fact
argued
in
opposition
to
cert
that
most
stops
are
upheld.
under
the
would-have
test
you're
only
catching
the
most
egregious
situations.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
uh-huh.
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
right.
we're
just
catching...
we're
just
catching
those
situations
where,
in
effect,
because
the
regulation
is
either
not
enforced
or
is
essentially
unenforced
under
the
circumstances,
that
the
discretion
is
really
the
same
as
in
prouse.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--not
that
i
know
of.
the
ninth
circuit
a
few
years
ago
i
think
was
still
using
some
subjective
language,
but
no.
but
i
think
your
honor
has
picked
up
on
exactly
the
situation
that
the
government's
test
is
unacceptable.
we
either
need
a
subjective
test
or
an
objective
reasonableness
test.
you
know,
we
understood
the
subjective
test
to
be
foreclosed
by
the
court's
precedents,
but
i
also
think
our
test
is
far
more
workable
than
a
subjective...
because
it's
objective.
it's
like
any
other
objective
reasonableness
test.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
well--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
i'm...
the
reg
about
the
unmarked
car?
i'm--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--on
pages
1
and
2
of
our
brief
we
quote--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--the
relevant
section,
and
it
says,
under
policies,
traffic
enforcement
action
may
be
taken
under
the
following
circumstances,
and
it
lists
three,
and
then
the
fourth
section
says,
on
page
2,
members
who
are
not
in
uniform
or
are
in
unmarked
vehicles
may
take
enforcement
action
only
in
the
case
of
a
violation
that
is
so
grave
as
to
pose
an
immediate
threat,
to
the
safety
of
others,
so
we
read
that
as--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
don't
throw
out
an
arrest.
i
mean,
a
person
couldn't
necessarily
suppress
their
presence...
they
couldn't
beat
a
ticket
under
this.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
because
they
can't
suppress
their
presence,
i
guess--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--right.
it
would
have
to
be
some
evidence
that
had
been
seized
in
order
to
raise
any
suppression
issue,
any
issue
in
a
criminal
case.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
our
case
does
come
under
the
could-have
test
as
interpreted
by
some
of
the
courts,
which
do
incorporate
an
authorization-type
requirement--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--he
would
be
subject
to
discipline.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
i
think
certainly
that's
all
the
court
has
to
answer
in
this
case,
and
what
we
have
here
is
an
administrative
scheme,
and
the
police
have
set
up
certain
policies
and
procedures
of
how
the
administrative
scheme
is
going
to
be
executed,
and
we
can
tell
objectively
from
looking
at
this
stop
this
was
not
a
stop
pursuant
to
that
objective--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
again,
i...
we
say
in
our
brief,
i
don't
think
there
would
necessarily
in
every
case...
the
reg
would
not
be
determinative,
and
let
me
give
this
example
where
there
could
be
reasonable
violation
of
a
regulation.
if,
for
example,
the
regulation
did
not
contain
the
exception
for
immediate
threats
to
safety,
and
my
clients
had
been
weaving
all
over
the
place
and
appeared
to
be
drunk
or
reckless
driving,
i
don't
think
that
we
could
argue
that
that
could
be
unreasonable--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
i
think
this
case
is
easy
for
the
reason
your
honor
is
saying,
is
that--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--no,
it
did
not,
because
in
caceres
the
court
was
very
clear
that
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
in
fact,
no
constitutional
right
implicated
at
all,
so
i
want
to
make
clear
i'm
not
saying
that
any
regulation
that
the
police
happen
to
have
is
going
to
automatically
result
in
suppression,
only
those
that
bear
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
officer's
conduct.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
that
that
is
saying
we
enacted
this
reg
to
protect
the
personal
security
of
motorists,
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
i
think
it--
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
degree
of
intrusion
is...
the
manner
it's
made
in
is
relevant
to
what
the
degree
of
intrusion
is
and
what
the
citizen's
privacy
interest
is,
so
you
would
still
have
an
enhanced
citizen
privacy
interest
in
a
case
where
an
unmarked
car
was
used.
ms.

well,
i
think
the
department...
the
judge
will
have
to
take
into
account
the
violation
of
the
regulation
and
the
entire
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve--

ms.
lisa
burget
wright
--i
think
there
could
theoretically
be
a
case
where
the
regulation
was
violated,
but
the...
but
it
was...
but
if
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
violated
the
regulation
because
of
the
circumstances,
then
that
would
pass
our
test.
it
all
comes
down
to
a
basic
reasonableness
inquiry,
and
i
just...
you
know,
on
a
balancing
i
would
just
again
point
out
that
the
kind
of
cases
we're
talking
about
are
the
marginal
cases,
where
the
government
can't
really
claim
much
interest,
because
this
is
action
it
has
decided
not
to
take.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
ms.
lisa
burget
wright
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i
think
we'll
rest
on
our
briefs.
thank
you
very
much.
