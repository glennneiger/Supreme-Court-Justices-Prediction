mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
our
position
that
the
traffic
stop
of
petitioners
in
this
case
was
valid,
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
under
the
fourth
amendment,
a
traffic
stop
that
is
supported
by
probable
cause,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
and
that
was
undertaken
in
a
reasonable
manner
and
scope,
as
it
also
was
in
this
case,
is
valid.
in
our
view,
that
conclusion
follows
regardless
of
the
subjective
motivations
of
the
officers
who
made
the
stop,
the
internal
regulations
of
the
department
that
divide
up
duties
among
different
police
officers,
or
the
standard
police
practices
that
the
officers
in
a
given
jurisdiction
may
happen
to
follow.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
well,
i
would...
i
disagree
with
you
about
that.
i
think
the
question,
the
historic
role
of
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
not
to
stand
in
the
way
of
society
enforcing
laws
that
are
on
the
books
and
are
perfectly
valid
laws.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
can't
say
that
i
can
think
of
another
area,
but
what
we're
really
talking
about
is
the
whole
of
police
work.
police
officers
are
always
faced
with
a
choice
of
what
laws
they
should
enforce
and
what
actions
they
should
take--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--to
enforce
those
laws.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
yes,
i
think
i
am
saying
that,
so
long
as
there's
probable
cause,
and
so
long
as
the
actions
that
the
police
officer
take
are
only
those
that
are
authorized
by
the
probable
cause
that
he
has.
the
officer
in
this
case
did
not
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
car
initially
when
he
first
saw
it
on
the
street
and
therefore
couldn't
have
stopped
it
and
gone
through
the
car
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
drugs.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
he
did
have--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
everybody
at
every
minute
while
they're
driving
are
subject
to
being
stopped
for
a
traffic
offense.
people...
i
don't
think
it's
that
difficult
to
generally
obey
the
traffic
laws,
and
i
think
most
people
do
almost
all
the
time.
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
i
don't
think
that
that's
true,
i
think...
but
i
do
think
that
that
really
presents
the
key
question
in
this
case.
the
balance
in
the
fourth
amendment,
and
it's
struck
in
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment,
which,
by
the
way,
petitioners
don't
print
in
their
brief
the
relevant
text,
which
is
the
part
that
says,
no
warrant
shall
issue
except
upon
probable
cause.
the
point
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
say,
there
is
a
society's
interest
in
enforcing
the
law,
and
there
is
individual
expectations
of
privacy,
and
at
the
point
where
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
law
has
been
violated,
then
taking
the
appropriate
investigative
or
enforcement
stop
that's
predicated
by
that
probable
cause
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
there's
a...
i
agree
with
that.
i
think
there's
a
myriad
of
different
circumstances
that
a
police
officer
may
take
into
account
in
deciding
which
traffic
laws,
which
violations
of
a
particular
traffic
law
to
enforce,
which
traffic
laws
to
enforce,
or
whether--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
actually
think...
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
if
you're
a
drug
dealer
and
you're
concerned
that
a
police...
if
you
have
drugs
and
you're
concerned
the
police
might
stop
you,
i
think
that
it's...
you'd
be
well
advised
to
obey
the
traffic
regulations.
if
you
don't,
you're
subject--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
believe
that
that--
[laughter]
i
guess...
i'm
not
aware
that
at
least
under
the
regulations
of
the
district
of
columbia
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
obey
all
of
the
traffic
regulations.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
because
the
reasonableness
inquiry
under
the
fourth
amendment
turns
on...
as
i
said,
on
the
balance
between
society's
interest
in
enforcing
the
laws
and
the
individual's...
an
individual's
expectation
of
privacy.
it
doesn't
turn
on
the
particular
practices
of
a
police
department,
or
it
doesn't
turn
on
the
subjective
motivations
of
a
particular
policeman.
where
a
law
is
violated,
society,
per
se,
has
an
interest
in
taking
the
appropriate
enforcement
action.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
in
that
case
there
would
certainly
first
be
a
question
of
whether...
if
somebody
who
happens
to
work
for
the
government
and
purports
to
make
a
traffic
stop
does
so
whether--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there
may
not
be
a
fourth...
well,
i
would
start
off
by
saying
there
may
not
be
a
fourth
amendment
incident
at
all
in
that
case,
because
if
he's
just
acting...
he
happens
to
be
employed
by
the
government,
but
happens
to
pretend
that
he's
a
policeman,
he's
really
just
a
private
individual
out
there...
out
there.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
do
think
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
do
think
as
a
general
matter,
as
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
it
doesn't
make
a
difference,
and
let
me
say
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
said,
in
a
number
of
cases,
that
the
fact
that
a
given
enforcement
practice
does
or
does
not
violate
state
or
local
law,
or
a
state
constitution
for
that
matter,
is
not
itself
reason
to
say
that
it
violates
or
doesn't
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
and
i'm
not
aware
that
those
sorts
of
cases
have
arisen.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
case
that's
arisen,
in
point
of
fact.
in
this
case,
there
wasn't
any
doubt
about
the
authority
of
the
policeman
both
under
statute
and
under
regulation
to
enforce
the
district
of
columbia
traffic
laws.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
that...
i
think
such
a
regulation
probably
would
be
enforceable.
it's
not
what
we
have
here,
but
it
probably
would
be...
excuse
me,
not
enforceable,
but
probably
wouldn't
provide
an
independent
ground
to
hold
a
stop
illegal
so
long
as
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
violation.
now...
that
the
violation
had
occurred.
now,
if
the
whole
nature
of
a
given
offense,
and
this
is
a
kind
of
a--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
because
i
think...
well,
with
one
caveat
that
i'll
get
to.
in
general,
enforcing
the
law
under
the
fourth
amendment,
giving
a
traffic
ticket
to
somebody
who's
violated
the
law
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
it's
a
nonarbitrary
action.
there's
a
reason
for
it,
which
is,
the
person
violated
the
traffic
stop.
now,
if
there's
a...
if
the
system
of
laws
in
a
given
jurisdiction
shows
there's
some
offense
that's
defined
in
such
an
odd
way
that
it
really
is
just
a
way
to
let
the
officers
in
that
jurisdiction
get
around...
circumvent
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
get
a
drug
dealer
on
less
than
probable
cause,
there
might
be
some
kind
of
problem
with
a
statute
like
that,
where
the
whole
thing
was
just
a
sham.
but
short
of
that,
i
would
not
say
that...
i
don't
think
there
is
a
problem,
and
if
you
start
saying
that
state
and
local
regulations--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
it...
that
says
that
in
the
view
of
that
police
department
they're
going
to
try
to
put
their
enforcement
resources
in
places
where
they
think
that
they're
most
warranted,
and
i
don't
think
there's
actually
anything
wrong
with
that
practice.
in
this
case,
the
police
officer
saw...
was
in
a
high
drug
area,
the
police
officer
saw
this
car
driving
erratically,
and
the
police
officer
perfectly
reasonably
felt
that
that
was
a
time
when
he
ought
to
see
what's
going
on
and
make
sure
that
the
traffic
laws
are
being
obeyed,
and
that's
what
he
did.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
he
ever...
he
never
said
that,
actually.
what
the
officer
said
was,
i
don't
usually
do
traffic
stops.
he
also
said,
i
do
carry
a
book
of
traffic
tickets
with
me.
he
said,
i
didn't
intend
to
give
this
driver--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
he
said
he
was
initially...
initially,
he
saw
that
car
stopped
at
a
stop
sign
for
an
inordinate
length
of
time
with
another
car
behind
this
car,
and
thought
this
is
a
driver
who's
not
paying
attention
to
what
he's
doing.
as
they
followed
him,
as
it...
there
were
two
other
violations
that
were
committed.
he
failed
to--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
initial...
initially
he
did
it
because
he
was
stopped
at
a
stop
sign
for
too
long
a
time.
that's
the
only
reason
the
officer
gave
for
why
he
stopped
the
car,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there
were
two
officers
in
this
case.
there's
officer
soto,
and
i
don't
recall
at
the
moment
the
other
officer's
name.
officer
soto,
my
recollection
of
the
record
is,
he
never
said
that.
the
other
officer,
when
he
was
called
by
one
of
the
defendants
as
a
witness,
said...
when
he
was
asked,
why
did
you
stop
the
car,
he
did
say
reasonable
suspicion,
but
if
you
look
at
his
testimony,
i
find
it
completely
ambiguous
as
to
whether
he
had
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
traffic
violation
or
reasonable
suspicion
of
something
else
and
that
the
traffic
violation--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there...
i'm
not
sure
how
egregious
they
were.
driving
at
an
unreasonable
speed
in
particular
can
be
thought
to
be
a
serious
offense.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
in
our--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
our
view
of...
i
mean,
these
are
the
facts--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--in
our--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that...
i
don't
think
that
it's
illegal.
it's
a
violation
of
an
internal
police
department
order.
but
let
me...
there's...
i
really
have
two
answers
to
that
question.
the
first
is,
as
they...
somebody
has
already
referred
to
the
case
of
united
states
v.
caceres,
and
in
that
context
the
court
specifically
noted
that
there
are
serious
costs
that
are
imposed--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--when
you
make
every--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
think
that...
that
case,
in
fact,
involved
no
constitutional
violation--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--at
all,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
the...
yes,
that's
right,
but
the
rationale
of
that
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--was
that
if
you
make
every
internal
order
of
a
government
agency
regarding
how
its
people
should
act
for
every
reason
at
all,
if
you
make
every
one
of
those
subject
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
you're
going
to
severely
discourage
the
agency
from
making
any
rules
at
all.
and
i
would
add
that
in
this
case,
what
petitioners...
we
mentioned
that
possibility,
that
that
would
be
one
consequence
or
one
way
of
looking
at
petitioner's
view
in
this
case,
and
the
answer
seems
to
be
that
no,
there's
a
whole
fourth
amendment
law
also
of
what
kinds
of
rules
a
police
department
has
to
have,
and
those
rules
have
to
be
specific,
have
to
be
specific
enough
to
guide
the
discretion
of
the
officers
in
making
traffic
stops
with
respect
to
each
kind
of
traffic
offense,
and
i
would
also
think
the
same
rules
would
have
to
apply
in
all
other
areas
where
police
exercise
discretion.
if
a
police
goes
to
an
open
air
drug
market
and
is
trying
to
do
something
about
it,
and
sees
a
number
of
people
dealing
drugs,
and
picks
one
of
them,
i
think
the
defendant
under
their
rule...
i
don't
see
why
the
defendant
couldn't
say,
well,
why
did
you
pick
this
person
and
not
somebody
else,
and
you
have
to
have
a
rule
to
guide
that.
i
think
the
answer
to
the
problem
is
that
the
question
of
when
to
enforce
a
law
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
issue.
the
question
is
whether
you
are
enforcing
a
law.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
in
that...
where
he
would
go
would
be
to
the
bureau
of
traffic
adjudication.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
as
far
as
i
know
they
would...
the
stop
would
still
be
valid.
his
remedy
for
violating--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--his
remedy
would
be
with
the
police.
but
let
me
make...
i
had
one
other
point
i
did
want
to
raise
with
respect
to
justice
breyer's
question,
and
that
is,
there
are
numerous
cases
where,
for
instance,
state
constitutions
have
been
interpreted
to
extend
greater
protections
than
the
federal
fourth
amendment,
and
therefore,
where
a
police
officer's
action
under
state
law
was
illegal,
even
though
under
the
federal
constitution
it
met
the
standards.
well,
this
court's
never
suggested
that
all
of
those
cases
now
are
also
violations
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
they're
violations
of
state
law.
there's
a...
the
role,
the
primary
role
of
state
law,
and
perhaps
not
the
exclusive
one,
but
the
primary
role
of
state
law
is
in
defining
what
the
offenses
are.
it's
basically
federal
standards
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
determine
whether...
that
determine
what
actions
are
reasonable,
and
it's
our
submission
that
it
is
always
reasonable
to
enforce
the
law...
to
enforce
the
law
when
you
have
probable
cause
to
do
so.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
our
view
would
be
that
those
would
be
unconstitutional--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
they
would
be
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--and
there
would
be
different
standards
applied
to
them.
i
think
again
this
case
is
instructive.
in
the
suppression
hearing
in
this
case
the
officers
were
asked
questions
about
whether
they
made
the
stop
because
the
defendants
were
black.
the
officers
denied
that
they
had,
and
i
read
the
judge
agreed
that
those
denials
were
credible.
so
this
is
a
case
where
they
can't
meet
the
applicable
equal
protection
standard,
which
is
was
this
action
taken
because
of
the
race
of
the
defendants,
but
they
want
to
say,
well,
no,
we
can't
meet
that
standard,
but
the
fourth
amendment
imposes
more
stringent
standards.
i
think
our
answer
to
that
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
related
to
the
individual's
expectation
of
privacy,
and
society's
interest
in
enforcing
the
law,
and
it's
not
a
fourth
amendment
defense
to
say,
because
society
hasn't...
well,
i
violated
the
law,
or
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
i
did,
but
because
somebody
else
also
violated
the
law,
and
it
wasn't
enforced
against
that
person,
then
therefore
the
evidence
has
to
be
suppressed
and
it's
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
i...
the
test
that's
proposed
by
petitioners
would
result
in
very
arbitrary
results,
since
police
department
rules,
like
the
one
on
which
petitioners
rely--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
would
point
your
honor's
attention
to
the
tenth
circuit's
decision,
for
instance,
when
it
originally
had
adopted
a,
quote
would-have
test
and
moved
to
a
could-have
test.
and
one
of
the
reasons
it
did
was,
it
reviewed
its
cases
and
found
that
they
were
all
over
the
lot
when
courts
tried
to
figure
out
whose
practice
is
it
who
we're
supposed
to
look
at
when
we
look
at
standard
police
practices?
is
it
this
officer,
is
it
the
department
as
a
whole,
is
it
the
state
as
a
whole,
is
it
the
narcotics
unit,
or
the
traffic
enforcement
unit,
or
who?
and
then
think
of
all
the...
then
there
are
all
the
different
circumstances
under
which
laws
could
be
imposed.
after
all,
a
police
officer
i
think
reasonably
might
try
to
enforce
a
traffic...
a
minor
traffic
offense
when
he
has
nothing
else
to
do,
but
if
there
are
other
demands
on
his
time
and
attention,
he
might
well
choose
not
to.
it
just
raises
all
of
those
problems,
and
i
think
it's
partly
because
of...
and
inevitably
what
has
happened,
and
i
think
you'll
find
this
in
the
state
cases
as
well
as
the
cases
in
the
federal
courts
that
have
adopted
that
test,
the
judge
starts
looking
into
just
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
officer...
why
did
you
make
the
stop?
would
you
usually
have
made
the
stop?
i
think
that's
what
it
generally
degenerates
into,
and,
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
formulation
of
the
would-have
test,
it's
whether
the
reasonable
officer
would
have
committed
the
traffic
stop
if
he
had
been
motivated...
really,
it's
if
he
had
been
motivated
by
a
desire
just
to
enforce
the
traffic
laws.
and
really,
what
it
is
is,
it's
just
a
not
very
precise
way
of
trying
to
get
a
subjective
motivation.
a
long
line
of
this
court's
cases
have
held
that
subjective
motivation
is
not
the
touchstone
in
fourth
amendment
cases
in
contexts
similar
to
this,
and
so
you
can't
go
look
directly
at
it,
but
by
using
things
like
the
rules
in
this
case
as
a
proxy
for
that,
you're
both
way
overinclusive
and
way
underinclusive.
one
problem
is
that
the
disobedience
of
a
rule
of
the
sort
that's
involved
here
doesn't
necessarily
show
that
the
officer
was
operating
under
any
kind
of
pretext
at
all.
there
may
be
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
a
rule...
for
instance,
a
jurisdiction
may
have
a
rule
that
officers
from
one
precinct
can't
stop
cars
in
another
precinct.
there
may
be
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
an
officer
would
violate
that
rule
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it
might
be
a
pretext
or
not.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
also
dramatically
underinclusive,
because
there
may
be
all
kinds
of
cases
where
officers
don't
violate
rules,
but
where
they
decide
to
enforce
the
law
in
a
discretionary
situation
in
one
case
rather
than
another
because
of
a
hunch,
or
because
of
a
belief
that
by
doing
so
they
may
deter
some...
or
enforce,
or
find
evidence
of
some--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
would...
that
is
our
view.
i
think
that
if
the
real
objection
here
is
that
the
traffic
laws
are
too
hard
for
people
to
enforce,
and
therefore
people
violate
them
and
subject
themselves
to
traffic
stops
on
a
regular
basis,
then
the
remedy
is
with
the
legislature,
which
has
obviously
not
passed
an
appropriate
set
of
traffic
laws
if
that
were
true.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
i
think
that
the
problem
is
not
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer.
there
are
many
laws
that
are
not
enforced
100
percent.
there
are
many
laws
that
are
only
rarely
enforced.
but
in
fact,
the
traffic
laws
are
a
good
example
of
where
selective
enforcement,
where
enforcing
them
occasionally,
can
have
a
great
deterrent
value.
if
you
are
out
on
a
highway
and
thinking
of
violating
the
speed
limit,
you
can
know
for
a
certainty
that
the
police
officers
don't
have
the
manpower
to
stop
every
one
of
the
cars
in
the
heavy
traffic
around
you
for
that
violation,
but
what
you
don't
know
is
whether
they'll
stop
you,
and
that
possibility
of
exactly
that
kind
of
occasional
enforcement
is
in
fact
what
the
traffic
laws
depend
on.
in
short,
i
think
that
petitioners'
arguments
are
primarily
directed
towards
interests
that
are
not
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
insofar
as
there's
an
equal
protection
claim,
that
claim
should
be
made
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
didn't
succeed
in
this
case,
and
there's
no
reason
to
adopt
a
more
lenient
standard
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
insofar
as
their
claim
is
that
the
law
is
just
too
difficult
to
obey
and
subjects
too
many
people
to
being
stopped
for
traffic
violations,
that
really
is
a
problem
with
the
traffic
laws
and
not...
because
perhaps,
if
that's
so,
they
erect
too
high
a
standard
for
people
to
obey.
but
under
the
fourth
amendment,
where
someone
is...
where
someone...
where
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
statute
is
violated,
or
a
regulation
is
violated,
then
that
is
all
that
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
inquiry
requires.
thank
you.
