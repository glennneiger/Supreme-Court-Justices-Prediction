unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this,
if
i
may,
ms.
wright.
does
the
fact
that
the
arresting
officer
is
in
plain
clothes
and
in
an
unmarked
vehicle
and
that
the
officer's
observations
are
for
a
supposedly
minor
traffic
offense,
do
those
factors
all
go
into
the
pot
in
determining
under
the
fourth
amendment
whether
the
traffic
stop
is
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
is
there...
is
that
part
of
the
mix
or
not,
or
do
we
only
consider
what
it
is
the
officer
observed
without
considering
the
fact
that
it
is
an
unmarked
vehicle
and
a
nonuniformed
officer?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
a
departmental
policy?
unknown
speaker
the
officer
was
supposed
to
be
in
uniform
and
in
fact
he
was
in
plain
clothes,
then
that
could
be
a
factor
in
saying
that
the
stop
was
not
proper?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
a
policy
that
is
set
forth
explicitly.
it
isn't
just
the
common
practice.
i
thought
your
argument
was
more
than
just
an
explicit
policy.
i
thought
that
even
though
the
officers
were
neither
prohibited
by
the
letter
of
the
law,
nor
even
by
any
explicit
mandate
of
their
department
from
making
a
stop
for
a
technical
violation,
if,
indeed,
it
was
the
practice
that
all
of
the
officers
of
the
department
used
not
to
stop
for
technical
violation,
that
would
be
enough
to
render
it
violative.
isn't
that
what
you
were
arguing,
or
is
it?
unknown
speaker
okay.
that's
what
you
mean
by
a
policy,
then.
you
just
mean
the
standard
practice.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
troubles
me
about
your
argument
is,
it,
you
know,
the
woulda-coulda-shoulda
argument.
i
mean,
whether
it
should
be...
you
know,
whether
he
could
have
stopped,
or
would
have
stopped.
to
draw
the
line
at
would
have
stopped,
that
is,
to
require
the
officer
to
be
following
the
standard
practice,
seems
to
make
a
lot
of
sense
if
you
only
apply
it
in
these
evidentiary
exclusionary
cases,
where,
you
know,
they
stop
a
car
and
find
drugs,
as
here,
and
then
try
to
introduce
the
drugs.
but
you
can't
limit
that
policy
to
that.
the
result
of
that
policy
would
be
that
any
officer
in
the
whole
department
who
follows
the
letter
of
the
law
but
does
not
follow
the
general
practice
of
the
department
stops
an
innocent
motorist,
does
not
find
drugs,
but
the
motorist
gets
mad
and
says,
what
do
you
mean,
stopping
me
for
a
broken
taillight,
and
then
sues
the
officer
under
1983,
or
the
department
under
1983,
and
you
are
guilty
of
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
officer
in
the
department
can
act
technically
under
the
law
if
the
rest
of
the
department
is
being
more
liberal,
and
he
violates
the
fourth
amendment
if
he
does
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is,
you
know,
to
my
mind
a
big
deal,
and
i
don't
go,
you
know,
tossing
it
around
arbitrarily,
and
to
say
that
every
time
a
policeman,
although
he's
technically
correct
in
making
a
stop,
is
not
as
liberal
as
the
rest
of
his
colleagues
in
the
department,
he
thereby
violates
the
fourth
amendment,
does
not
strike
me
as
true.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
was
candid,
and
i
think
is
consistent
with
your
position,
but
i
think
it
exposes
some
real
difficulties.
in
addition
to
the
ones
that
the
justice
mentioned,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
makes
certain
traffic
laws
simply
a
dead
letter
at
the
option
of
the
police
department.
unknown
speaker
but
the
police
don't
have
the
authority
to
tell
the
legislature
which
traffic
laws
are
to
be
repealed.
unknown
speaker
you
say
police
are
acting
unreasonably
in
your
situation.
now,
was...
i
take
it
from
what
you
say
there's
a
departure
from
established
department
policy
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
departure?
unknown
speaker
and
so
in
this
case
it
was
a
plainclothesman
who
made
the
traffic
stop.
unknown
speaker
why
on
earth
should
that
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
simply
to
depart
from
department
policy?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
total
discretion
in
prouse.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
can
you
general...
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
a
holding
that
would
presumably
bind
courts
all
over
the
country.
can
you
be
that
sure
of
what
the
various
police
departments
all
over
the
country
prescribe?
unknown
speaker
so
if
a
police
department
then
said
that
plainclothesmen
as
well
as
uniformed
police
can
make
traffic
stops,
then
this
would
have
been
perfectly
all
right
in
that
kind
of
a
department.
unknown
speaker
so
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
dependent
on
what
kind
of
a
policy
that
the
particular
police
department
has.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
an
inventory
search,
which
we've
always
said
had
to
be
personal
to
some
sort
of
a
policy,
and
you
say
we
should
carry
over
that
rule
here.
wouldn't
it
in
fact,
if
your
view
is
adopted,
wouldn't
that
lead
to
pretty
elaborate
testimony
at,
say,
a
suppression
hearing
as
to
what
the
department
policy
was?
supposing
there
wasn't
any
written
policy,
but
i
take
it
your
argument
isn't
limited
to
that.
you
could
interrogate
officers
about
what
was
the
practice.
would
that
be
permissible?
unknown
speaker
it
might
not
be
difficult,
but
it
would
be
time-consuming.
unknown
speaker
as
it
was
in
this
case.
soto
said,
i
don't
do
this.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
instead
of
having...
the
plainclothes
people
who
are
supposed
to
spend
their
time
pursuing
big
crime
and
not
traffic
violations
had
said,
well,
we
know
what
we're
supposed
to
do,
so
they
radioed
the
regular
patrol
cops,
and
the
same
thing
happened,
is
that
the
whole
of
your
position?
it's
only
that
the
plainclothes
people...
they
suspect
that
there's
some
drug
trafficking
but
they
haven't
got
probable
cause,
and
they
see
that
this
person
is
not
the
best
driver
in
the
world.
they
radio
the
regular
cops
on
the
beat,
and
the
regular
cops
can
stop
that
car.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
patrol
police
that
i
have
in
mind,
their
job
is
to
patrol
traffic
violations,
and
that's
all
they
do,
so
they
stop
pepple
who
are
speeding,
who
go
through
a
red
light,
don't
signal,
that's
what
they
do
all
day,
every
day.
if
the
plainclothes
people
simply
radio
such
a
car
to
do
the
work
for
them,
then
your
fourth
amendment
claim
evaporates?
unknown
speaker
but
in
your
case
i
take
it
your
answer
is
that
you
would
lose
if
what
had
happened
here
is
soto
radioed
a
regular
patrol
car
and
the
regular
patrol
car
said,
you
weren't
paying
full
attention
to
your
driving,
you
turned
without
signaling.
unknown
speaker
supposing
you
get
an
officer,
the
arresting
officer
on
the
stand,
and
you
ask
him,
did
the
department
have
a
written
policy
respecting
what
you
did
here?
the
officer
says
no,
the
department
does
not
have
a
written
policy.
then
you
say,
does
the
department
have
any
practice,
even
though
it's
not
in
written
form.
the
officer
says
no.
well
now,
you're
not
bound
by
his
answer
at
a
suppression
hearing,
are
you?
can't
you
interrogate
other
officers?
maybe
this
guy
is
wrong
as
to
whether
there
is
a
practice.
unknown
speaker
but
of
course,
you
don't
know
that
when
he's
on
the
stand.
you're
naturally
going
to
want
to
prove
that
he's
not
doing
what
everybody
else
is
doing.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
know,
it's
not
just
any
deviation
in
your
view,
but
a
gross
deviation?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
it--
--why
do
you
make
the
assumption
that
anything
that
is
a
deviation
from
the
norm
is
unreasonable?
i
mean,
there
are
reasonable
things
that
are
not
the
things
that
the
majority
does.
i
mean,
it
may
well
be
reasonable
not
to
stop
cars
that
just
have
broken
taillights,
and
that
may
be
the
general
practice
in
the
particular
police
department,
but
that
does
not
automatically
make
it
unreasonable
to
stop
a
car
that
has
a
broken
taillight,
and
other
departments
may
make
that
their
practice,
so
why
does
it
become
unreasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
simply
by
being
atypical?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
not
saying
policies
that
govern.
you're
just
saying
policy...
by
a
policy
that
governs,
you
say
you
don't
mean
a
directive.
you
mean,
what
is
generally
done.
unknown
speaker
you
just
mean
a
practice.
you
don't
mean
a
command.
unknown
speaker
no,
they
can't
do
that,
but
they...
and
they
can
develop
a
practice
of
not
stopping
cars
with
broken
taillights,
and
that
would
be
reasonable.
but
had
they
developed
a
practice
of
stopping
cars,
all
cars
with
broken
taillights,
that
would
also
be
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
so
why
is
stopping
a
car
with
a
broken
taillight
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
just
because
this
department
as
a
general
practice,
though
it's
not
a
command,
it
has
chosen
the
other
reasonable
thing
it
doesn't
render
the
other
one
any
less
reasonable,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
the
one
instance
the
conduct
is
criminal,
in
the
other
instance
it's
not.
i
mean,
that's
your
distinction.
what
if
you
had
a
department
in
which
the
practice
was
that
if
they
were
busy
or
worried
about
other
things
they
didn't
worry...
they
didn't
stop
people
for
broken
taillights,
but
if
they
weren't
busy,
they
did
stop
people
for
broken
taillights.
usually,
they're
busy.
sometimes
late
at
night
they're
not.
so
at
11:00
somebody
gets
stopped
for
a
broken
taillight.
what's
the
practice?
how
do
you
deal
with
that
under
your
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
fine.
what
does
he
do?
was
it
reasonable
for
my
officer
to
stop
at
11:00
because
he
wasn't
busy?
unknown
speaker
then
every
police
department
in
the
united
states
is
going
to
have
a
policy
that
says,
when
we're
not
busy,
we're
going
to
enforce
the
traffic
laws,
and
your
rule
isn't
going
to
catch
anybody,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
the
standard
practice
is
going
to
be.
every
police
department
is
going
to
say,
don't
waste
time
on
trivia
if
you're
busy.
if
you're
not
busy,
go
ahead
and
enforce
the
minutiae,
and
that's
going
to
be
the
end
of
your
rule,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
sure.
it's
11:00,
the
streets
are
empty,
one
car
goes
by
with
a
broken
taillight.
you're
going
to
lose
that
case
if
the
department
has
my
policy.
the
policeman
has
just
finished
his
donut.
he's
just
finished
his
donut.
he's
not
even--
[laughter]
you
lose,
don't
you,
on
my
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
a
token...
the
policy
is,
if
you're
not
busy,
it's
entirely
proper
for
you
to
enforce
this
stuff,
and
the
officer
does.
you
lose
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
okay.
that's
not
going
to
give
you
much
protection,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
experience,
though,
it's
not
just
your
guess,
ms.
wright?
are
there
any
states
that
for
their
state
system
have
adopted
this
reasonable
officer
would
have,
instead
of
an
officer
could
have?
are
there
any
states
that
have
it...
the
tenth
circuit
divided
into...
one
said
it's
unworkable,
and
the
other
says
it
is
workable.
do
we
know
what's
done
in
the
states?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
i
think
you
said
that,
too.
unknown
speaker
that
this
is
just
some
check,
because
otherwise
probable
cause
is
virtually
nonexistent.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
the
difficulties
of
enforcing
your
rule
are
sufficiently
great
that
it
would
almost
be
as
easy
for
you
to
argue
that
we
should
turn
to
the
subjective
test,
which
requires
overruling
many
of
our
decisions,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
almost
more
workable.
unknown
speaker
if
we
think
there's
a
horrible
problem
here,
we
have
to
do
something...
do
any
states
use
the
subjective
test?
unknown
speaker
i
looked
for
the
words
of
the
reg,
and
neither
you
nor
the
government
quote
the
operative
word.
you
both
say
that
the
reg
says
that
a
plainclothes
officer
should,
but
that's
not
in
quotes,
should,
i
guess,
arrest
somebody
only
in
the
case
of
an
immediate
threat
to
safety,
but
if
that's
really
the
word
of
the
reg,
should,
i
didn't
know
what
it
meant.
that
is,
does
it
mean
that
if
the
officer
does
happen
to
stop
a
person
for
a
taillight,
and
doesn't
think
it's
an
immediate
threat,
that
they
throw
out
the
ticket,
or
they
throw
out
the
case,
or
that
the
officer
is
punished,
or...
i
mean,
you
might
interpret
it
to
say,
officer,
if
you
see
an
immediate
threat,
go
arrest
the
person.
officer,
if
you
don't
see
an
immediate
threat,
it's
up
to
you,
really.
no
need
to
do
it.
it
doesn't
say
you
should
not.
unknown
speaker
it
says
when
you
should,
and
i
think
most
officers
would,
in
fact,
believe
they
have
authority
to
arrest
somebody
if
they
see
a
crime,
so...
i'm
pointing
this
out
because
i
don't
know
what
the
reg
says
precisely.
i'd
like
to
know.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it's
actually
there?
oh,
great.
sorry.
unknown
speaker
so
they
interpret
that
to
mean,
and
they
throw
out
the
arrest,
or
what
do
they
do?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
suppression
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
you
really
don't
have...
to
win
your
case
you
don't
have
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
practice
also
would
suffice.
unknown
speaker
and,
indeed,
you
don't
even
have
to
adopt
a
would-have
test.
you
could
say
your
case
comes
under
the
could-have
test.
unknown
speaker
would...
this
officer
would
be
violating
department
policy,
and
i
suppose
would
be
subject
to
discipline
for
having
done
this,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
really,
this
is
a
totally...
i
mean,
i
haven't
focused
on
it
in
this
way,
but
the
question
you're
presenting
is
whether
or
not
you
suppress
evidence
when
seized
by
an
officer
in
violation
of
a
regulation
of
a
department.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
on
earth
should
the
fourth
amendment
incorporate
the
department
policy?
unknown
speaker
so
there
are
administrative
law
cases,
caceres,
and
so
forth,
which
say
certain
violations
of
regs
are
not
bases
for
throwing
out
evidence,
or
suppressing
evidence.
i'm
suddenly
seeing
the
case
in
that
light
as
a--
unknown
speaker
--but
ms.
wright,
does
the
united
states
v.
caceres...
i
think
that's
the
name
of
the
case...
did
that
speak
to
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
would
be
the
significance
of
this
case,
just
taking
your
narrow
view,
if
the
chief
of
the
department
comes
in
and
says...
testifies
well,
yes,
it's
true
they
violated
that
prohibition
on
plainclothes
officers
doing
that,
but
the
only
reason
we
have
that
prohibition
there
is
that
when
plainclothes
officers
start
making
arrests,
people
may
not
know
that
they're
police
officers,
and
then
they
fight
back,
and
it
gets
into
a
lot
of
trouble.
there
certainly
was
no
intent
behind
the
regulation
to
prevent
an
arrest
being
made
simply
for
the
sake
of
preventing
an
arrest
being
made.
is
that
the
end
of
your
case,
if
that's
the
testimony
and
it's
accepted?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
they
said
we
enacted
the
regulation
among
other
things
to
protect
the
personal
security
of
the
officer--
unknown
speaker
--and
perhaps
to
prevent
placing
motorists
in
positions
in
which
they
might
be
inclined
to
fight,
but
there
was
no
fight
here,
and
the
officer
didn't
get
hurt,
and
you
know,
we're
still
going
to
dock
his
pay
a
couple
of
hours
for
doing
what
he
did,
because
we...
you
know,
we
don't
want
to
run
these
risks,
but
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
our
view
of
when
it
is
or
is
not
appropriate
to
arrest
for
offenses
as
offenses.
isn't
that
the
end
of
your
case
if
that
position
is
accepted?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
that
may
be,
but
then
you're
going
beyond
that
very
narrow
view
in
which
you
say
the
touchstone
would
simply
be
the
departmental
prohibition.
unknown
speaker
so
there
isn't
really
that
narrow
a
view.
it's
always
going
to
be
ultimately
a
totality
test,
even
when
there
is
a
regulation,
and
the
regulation
at
least
ostensibly
prohibits
the
conduct.
unknown
speaker
it's
still
a
totality
test.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
wright.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
is
there
any
other
area
where
there
is
essentially
no
control
over
the
officers
operation
for
an
improper
motive?
i
mean,
probable
cause
really
doesn't
serve
as
a
meaningful
check
when
probable
cause
is,
i
stood
too
long
at
a
stop
light.
unknown
speaker
but
laws...
usually
when
you
go
to
a
magistrate,
you've
got
a
good
reason
to
go
after
that
person.
the
problem
of
no
control
over
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer,
the
reality
that
sooner
or
later
most
of
us
are
going
to
commit
some
traffic
violation
for
which
we
could
get
a
ticket,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
area
that
works
that
way,
other
than--
unknown
speaker
--traffic
violations.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
are
you
saying
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
pretextual
stop
that's
offensive
to
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
but
justice
ginsburg's--
unknown
speaker
--concern
is
a
very
real
one.
since
i
read
the
brief,
every
time
i
drive
my
car
i
think
maybe
i
can
be
stopped,
and
i--
[laughter]
it
seems
to
me
that
the
situation
is
a
little
bit
out
of
control.
i
don't
know
if
there's
an
answer
for
it.
unknown
speaker
he
could
fix
his
taillight.
i
mean,
that
might--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
get
the
impression
from
the
briefs
that
the
probable
cause
to
stop
would
exist
if
a
person
obeyed
the
traffic
laws
for
a
sufficient
period
of
time.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
you
would
add
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
say
that
a
traffic...
a
police
officer
can
distinguish
between
traffic
violations
which
do
not
appear
to
suggest
any
other
type
of
offense
and
traffic
violations
which
might
give
evidence
of
other
offense.
unknown
speaker
and
one
of
those
circumstances,
i
suppose,
is
a
hunch
that
this
fellow
may
be
a
drug
dealer.
unknown
speaker
if
it's
a
straight
car,
yes.
no,
except
that
then
you'd
give
rise
to
a
suspicion.
this
is
a
very
unusual
motorist.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
though,
one
problem
i
have,
i
find...
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
believing
that
it
is
reasonable
for
a
policeman
to
violate
the
regulations
of
his
own
department.
why
doesn't
that
make
his
action
unreasonable?
unknown
speaker
so
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
if
it
was
not
a
policeman
who
made
this
stop
but
one
of
the
municipality's
garbage
men
who
walked
over
to
the
car
and
made
this
bust,
that
would
be
okay,
because
after
all,
it's
just
a
local
law
that
has
assigned
these
duties
to
policemen
and
other
duties
to
garbage
men.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
garbage
man
to
do
that.
it's
not
his
job.
unknown
speaker
but
he
could
have
been
a
policeman.
i
mean,
he
could
have
been
a
policeman.
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
goes,
you
say
a
policeman
could
have
done
it.
it's
just
a
matter
of
internal
division
of
authority.
it's
just
the
internal
regulation.
this
man
could
have
been
a
cop.
he
happens
not
to
be.
unknown
speaker
what
difference
does
it
make
as
far
as
the
fourth
amendment
is
concerned?
unknown
speaker
have
we
upheld
under
the
fourth
amendment
searches
conducted
by
persons
not
authorized
by
law
to
make
an
arrest
or
conduct
a
search?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
appropriate
for
a
police
department
to
have
a
list
of
rules,
a
manual,
part
a
and
part
b.
part
a
says
what
all
the
traffic
officers
are
to
do,
and
they're
not
to
waste
their
time
with
people
having
strings
hanging
from
their
mirrors
and
putting
their
tire
on
the
line
or
off
the
pavement.
then
part
b
says
that
for
the
assistance
of
our
drug
enforcement
officers,
all
of
these
things
are
grounds
for
stops.
would
there
be
anything
constitutionally
objectionable
in
that,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
see
nothing
constitutionally
objectionable
in
the
practice
that
i've
hypothesized?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
my
hypothetical,
there's
a
police
department
regulation,
and
the
statutes
are
on
the
books,
but
it's
a
sham.
it's
designed
just
to
help
the
drug
people.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
feldman,
i
thought
that
wasn't
the
case.
i
thought
this
officer
said,
i
don't
do
traffic
stops.
i
did
here.
the
officer
i
thought
was
candid
about,
he
would
not
have
done
this
if
he
didn't
suspect...
without
probable
cause
that
there
were
drugs
in
that
car.
unknown
speaker
did
he
explain
why
they
were
following
this
car
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
at
what
point
did
the
officer
say,
i
followed
that
car
because
i
suspected--
unknown
speaker
--at
what
point
did
the
officer
say,
it
was
before...
it
was
certainly
before
the
car
was
stopped,
and
the
car
inspected,
that
the
car
was
being
followed
because
there
was
a
suspicion
that
it
contained
drugs?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
else
to
explain
why
officer
soto,
who
said,
i
don't
ordinarily
do
this,
would
have
done
it
in
this
case
when
the
traffic
violations
were
not
particularly
egregious?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
really
don't
care,
mr.
feldman,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
let's
be
honest.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
said
you
will
allow
pretextual
stops.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
he
has
a
proper
reason
to
stop,
pretextual
or
not,
you're
don't
care.
unknown
speaker
you're
just
being
nice
to
justice
ginsburg
in
trying
to
give
her
some
reasons
why--
[laughter]
--if
you
don't
like
pretextual
stops,
this
might
have
been
okay,
but
your
basic...
the
government's
basic
position
is
a
pretextual
stop
is
okay.
go
back...
could
you
go
back
for
a
second
to
the
other
question
justice
scalia
asked.
assume
pretextual
stops
are
fine.
what
about
a
stop
that
violates
the
law?
i
mean,
that's
what's
worrying
me
about
this
is.
as
i
went
back
and
looked
at
the
reg,
and
the
predecessor
reg,
it
does
seem
not
just
to
say,
you
may
arrest
someone,
plainclothes
officer,
when
you
see
a
special
risk.
it
seems
to
say,
you
may
not
arrest
someone,
plainclothes
officer,
in
the
absence
of
a
special
risk,
at
least
when
you
read
it
in
light
of
the
predecessor
statute.
so
if
that's
the
case,
it
isn't...
this
whole
issue's
nothing
to
do
with
pretextual
stops.
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
have
illegal
stops.
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--let
me
ask
about
that
case
specifically.
let
me...
because
i...
and
i
may
not
remember
it
correctly,
but
there
might
be
a
difference,
judging
from
that
case,
between
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
underlying
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
didn't,
perhaps
not.
unknown
speaker
it
was
simply
whether
they
were
going
to
exclude
violations
of
a
reg.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing,
mr.
feldman,
that
the
defendant
in
this
case,
they
had
found
no
drugs
at
all,
and
he
simply
came
into
the
court
and
said,
i...
you
can't
pin
this
traffic
offense
on
me
because
i
was
illegally
stopped.
it
was
a
violation
of
the
department
regulation.
what
should
be
the
result
there?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they'd
say,
what
fourth
amendment.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
you
really
don't
go
that
far,
because
you
wouldn't
say
selective
enforcement
based
on
race
or
religion
would
be
permissible.
unknown
speaker
for
a
different
reason.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
feldman,
does
it?
i
mean,
you
said
that,
and
the
would-have...
this
is
not
a
huge
requirement,
just
a
difference
between
could
an
officer
and
would
a
reasonable
person,
and
there
are
jurisdictions
where
this
would
have
apprehended
is
enforced.
i
haven't...
didn't
see
in
any
of
the
briefs
that
there's
this
disarray,
this
chaos
in
states
that
have
the
would-have
standard.
i
thought
it
turns
out
that
in
most
situations
would-have
would
yield
the
same
thing
as
could-have.
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
are
you
saying...
going
back
to
my
really
basic
question,
if
one
has
the
notion
that
probable
cause
doesn't
act
as
the
barrier
in
this
area,
that
it
does
in
others.
your
view
is,
well,
that's
what
we
have,
and
you
can't
have
any
probable
cause
plus,
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--it's
not
with
the
laws,
it's
with
the
discretion
of
the
police
officer.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
ms.
wright,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
