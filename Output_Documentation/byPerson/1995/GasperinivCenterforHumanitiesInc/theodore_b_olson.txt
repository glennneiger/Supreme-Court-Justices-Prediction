mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
performed
essentially
the
same
supervisorial
function
as
the
courts
at
westminster
had
performed
beginning
in
1655,
under
the
rules
of
common
law,
to
protect
against
exorbitant
judgments,
and
it
performed
the
supervisorial
function
required
by
erie
since
1938.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
those...
in
fact,
the...
blackstone
discusses
this
process
in
extensive
detail
in
chapter
24
of
volume
3
of
his
commentaries.
what
that
was,
en
banc
courts
sitting
to
review
the
decision
of
the
trial
and
the
trial
court.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
submit,
your
honor,
that
a
review
en
banc
by
the
court
above...
blackstone
referred--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--of
course,
the
entry
of
the
judgment
occurred
later.
when
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
was
adopted,
it's
very
interesting
that
the
new
trial
motion
occurred
after
the
entry
of
the
judgment.
the
entry
of
the
judgment
made
no
difference.
what
is
functionally
equivalent
to
what
happened
in
the
second
circuit
today
is
what
was
happening
in
the
courts
of
westminster
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
a
review
by
judges
other
than
the
trial
judge
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
as
blackstone
points
out
both
in
chapter
23
and
chapter
24
of
volume
23,
they
were
interchangeably
trial
judges,
judges
of
appeal,
and
judges
who
would
communicate
with
one
another
to
perform
a
supervisorial
function.
when
they
were
reviewing
motions
for
a
new
trial,
blackstone
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
purpose
was
to
preserve
the
jury
trial
itself,
because
if
aberrational
judgment,
errors
in
the
instruction,
errors
performed
by
juries,
excessive
judgments,
and
so
forth,
could
not
be
corrected.
the
faith
that
existed
in
the
jury
trial
would
vanish,
and
the
jury
trial
system
would
go
away.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
was
done
was
a
retrial
at
the
place
at
which
the
case
was
tried
initially,
unless
the
case
was
tried
originally
at
westminster.
then
it
could
be
tried
there.
the
same
essential
function.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
if
it
was
tried
originally
in
a
county
some
place
by
one
judge,
it
would
be
sent
back.
as
i
understand,
that's
the
process
that
would
work.
in
other
words,
it
is
very
much
functionally
equivalent
to
what
we
have
today,
separate
judges,
and
the
trial
judge
may
have
been
a
part
of
that
review,
or
he
may
not
have
been
a
part
of
the
review.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
fact--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
fact,
as...
justice
scalia,
as
you
are
aware,
those
decisions
are
very
short,
very
abbreviated.
some
of
them
refer
to
the
trial
judge.
some
of
them
do
not
refer
to
the
trial
judge
at
all.
there
is
no
statement
in
any
of
those
cases
that
say
that
we
could
not
consider
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
without
the
trial
judge.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
cases
are
not
clear
either
way.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
answer
that
question
yes,
but
i
also
say
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
said
i
don't
have
a
case
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--answers
it.
clearly,
i
should
have
said
no.
i
misunderstood
the
phrasing
of
the
question.
the
fact
is
that
if
you
review
those
cases
as
we
have
carefully
reviewed
them,
there
is
no...
first
of
all,
blackstone
does
not
say
that
it
required
a
certificate
by
the
trial
judge
to
review
possible
errors
made
by
the
trial
judge.
blackstone
talks
about
this
in
terms
of
supervising
possible
errors
that
may
have
occurred
before.
it
would
have
not
been
a
supervisorial
function
if
the
only
supervision
that
could
have
taken
place
would
have
been
with
the
permission
of
the
judge
being
supervised.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
in
the
first
place
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
made
no
distinction
whatsoever
in
terms
of
which
judge
or
in
which
function
the
new
trial
motion
could
be
considered
or
granted.
in
fact,
in
section
17
and...
in
section
17
and
section
18
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
it
says
either
judge
might
approve
the
going
forward
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
they're
referring
to
the
circuit
judges
in...
that's
in
section
18,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
understand
that.
we
did
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we...
well,
the
fact
is,
though,
that
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
did
not
say
that
this
had
to
be
done
by
a
trial
judge
sitting
in
a
trial
capacity.
it
authorized
any
court
of
the
united
states
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
the...
that's
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
what
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it...
no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
it
meant--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no,
the
decision--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
i'm
saying
is,
it
does
not
in
any
way
refute
the
process
that
was
going
on
concurrently
at
common
law
where
a
decision
was
made
by
a
separate
group
of
en
banc
judges
that
an
excess
of
judgment
had
been
rendered,
and
then
that
decision
that
a
new
trial
should
be
granted
was
sent
back
to
the
place
where
the
case
was
tried
originally,
or
to
where
the
record
was
returned,
in
the
exact
words
of
blackstone.
so
that
when
this
process...
because
we
created
a
different
system
of
courts
than
existed
in
england
at
the
time,
there
is
going
to
be
some
differential
in
the
process,
but
the
substance
of
the
fact
is
that
a
reexamination
and
a
grant
of
a
new
trial
was
not...
in
that
context
was
not
considered
to
be
a
reexamination,
which
the
framers
were
concerned
about.
it's
fairly
clear--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i
agree
with
everything
that
you
said,
and
i
was
going
to
discuss
the
erie
question.
what
the
appellate
court
clearly
did
in
this
case
is
decide
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
come
to
the
conclusion...
in
fact,
that
is
the
exact
words
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
case...
could
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
jury
did
in
this
case,
and
it's
clear,
in
giving
all
deference
to
the
decision
of
the
jury
and
all
inferences
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
that
the
district
judge
should
have
done
exactly
what
you
said.
and
the
court
in
this
case
granted
a
new
trial,
which
is
exactly
the
procedure
that
did
exist
at
common
law
to
correct
these
kinds
of
errors,
and
then
went
on
to
suggest,
as
permitted
under
the
federal
practice,
that
there
could
be
a
remittitur,
which
would
avoid
the
new
trial
in
the...
at
the
option
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
this
court
said
in
the
browning-ferris
case
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
review
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
see
whether
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
the
conclusion...
this
is
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
6
years
ago.
our
only
inquiry
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
finding
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
refusing
to
grant
petitioner's
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--this
case
involved
punitive...
the
browning-ferris
case
involved
punitive
damages.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
think
both
types
of
damages
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
the
decisions
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
them
and
sanctioned
them,
say
that
punitive
damages
and
compensatory
damages
do
involve
some
element
of
fact-finding
and
some
element
of
the
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts.
it's
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
facts,
especially
when
the
question
is
being
reviewed,
and
what
this
court
said
three
times--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
it
is
more
factual,
but
we're
on
a
spectrum
here.
blackstone
talks
in
terms
of,
when
it
talks
about
the
private
rights
and
private
wrongs
versus
public
rights
and
public
wrongs,
is
talking
about
punitive
damages
to
the
extent
that
he
was
examining
that
subject
in
a
context
of
a
public
wrong
and
a
public
remedy,
so
blackstone
at
least
was
considering
there
was
a
public
societal
interest
in
the
amount
of
punitive
damages.
now,
of
course,
this
case
does
not
involve
that
subject,
but
i
do
think
that
there
are
different...
you
have
state...
you're
having
a
state
impose
a
penalty
for
what's
perceived
as
antisocial
conduct
in
the
context
of
punitive
damages,
and
there
may
be
more
strict
judicial
review.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
in
this
court's
decision
in
pacific
mutual
v.
haslip,
the
court
said
that
appropriate
considerations
may
be
given
both
by
the
jury
and
the
judge
and
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
courts
of
how
much
other
punishment
existed,
what
was
the
degree
of
the
egregiousness
of
the
wrong,
and
things
of
that
nature.
i'm
tempted
very
much
to
agree
that
it's
purely
a
legal
question,
but
i
think
i
have
to
concede,
to
be
honest,
that
there
are
factual
elements
wrapped
up
in
it
under
this
court's
jurisprudence.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
believe
it
can.
i
believe--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
i
believe
it
can.
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
that
the
seventh
amendment
was
not
intended
to
enact
the
forms
of
practice
or
the
procedures
that
existed
at
common
law.
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
the
substance
of
what
was
taking
place
at
common
law.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
totally
agree
with
that.
in
fact,
that's
exactly
what
new
york
substantively
decided.
new
york
could
have
said,
no
case
shall
be...
in...
certainly
for
photography
shall
recover
more
than
$100,000,
but
the
legislature
obviously
felt
that
that
was
not
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
for
every
different
types
of...
type
of
action,
so--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
where
it
came
from,
but
i--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
of
course
it
is,
if
that's
the
characterization
that
you
accept
of
what
is
going
on
here.
i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
i
believe
that
it's
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
that's
taking
place
here.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
what
was
very
clearly
going
on
here
in
new
york
was
that
new
york
wanted
to
change
its
substantive
law.
it
changed
its
substantive
law
in
these
procedural
amendments
to
change
rules
like
joint
and
several
liability
and
other
things,
and
imposed
this
kind
of
comparable
limitation
on
the
amount
of
damages,
and
did
exactly
as
you
were
suggesting
in
your
question,
asked
the
court...
and
justice
kennedy's
question,
asked
the
court
to
look
at
other
verdicts
to
make
sure
that
judgments
are
not
going
to
be
out
of
whack,
that
they're
not
going
to
be
excessive,
that
they're
reasonably
consistent
with
judgments
in
other
cases.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
think
what
the
appellate...
i
think
it
is
possible
to
assume,
it's
possible
to
assume
anything
with
respect
to
what
the
district
judge
did
here,
because
he
didn't
say
anything
about
what
he
was
doing,
although
it's
clear
that
he
did
say
on
the
record
that
he
felt
that
$1,500
per
slide
was
not
something
that
was
possible.
he
said
no
sane
person,
or
words
to
that
effect,
would
accept
that
kind
of
characterization,
so
he
was
concerned
about
it,
but
then
when
it
came
to
granting
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
he
did
nothing.
he
just
denied
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
it's
clear
that
in
a
review
of
that,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
that
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
common
law
is
very
clear
that
the
supervisorial
function
by
the
court
above
was
to
be
considered
in
the
matter
of
the
sound
discretion,
though
it's
the
words
of
blackstone,
of
the
court
above.
he
did
acknowledge,
and
it's
understandable
that
the
trial
judge
would
have
been
consulted
with
respect
to
whether
the
new
trial
would
be
granted
because
we
did
not
have
records
in
those
days
like
we
do
today--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
what
he--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--those
are
the
words
he
said.
now,
what
could
be
more
similar
to
what
happened
here
than
to
that
process,
a
separate,
en
banc
court
reviewing
the
procedures
that
had
occurred
out
in
the
countryside
to
determine
whether
there
was
an
excessive
verdict,
and
the
exercise
of
the
sound
discretion
of
that
court
to
determine
whether
there's
an
aberration,
but--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
certainly,
i
don't...
i'm
not
personally
familiar,
i
think,
with
the
court's
jurisprudence
on
fela
cases
and
whether...
the
extent
to
which
the
seventh
amendment
would
impact
that
decision.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i'm...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
answer
to
your
question
depends
upon
whether
we're
talking
about
erie
or
the
seventh
amendment.
the
seventh
amendment,
to
the
extent
that
it
adopted
the
rules
at
common
law,
did
not
constitutionalize
a
standard
of
review.
the
standard
of
review
was
in
the
discretion
of
the
court
above.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
this
court
and
the
courts
of
the
united
states
chose
to
implement
that
in
many
respects
as
an
abuse-of-discretion
standard,
and
there
is
some
support
for
that
in
blackstone,
because
naturally--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
the
better
view
is
as
cited
in
both
of
the
briefs
and
cited
by
petitioner,
that
justice
story
articulated,
that
it
was
the
federal
common
law
which
the
framers
of
the
constitution
were
referring--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
mean,
excuse
me,
the
english
common
law,
rather
than
the
law...
the
common...
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
and
particularly
in
galloway,
the
common
law
was...
and
hamilton
writes
about
this
in
federalist
81
and
82
and
83,
that
the
common
law
in
each
particular
state
differed.
in
four
states,
there
was
an
automatic
right
to
a
second
trial.
in
fact,
you
would
have
trials
until
you
got
two
out
of
three.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
part
of
the
common
law,
justice
scalia...
in
fact,
i'm
glad
that
you
made
that
point.
part
of
the
common
law
was,
and
part
of
the
reverence
that
we
have
for
the
common
law
and
the
framers
had
for
the
common
law
was
the
fact
that
it
was
a
continuing
evolutionary
process
by
which
justice
would
be
done,
and
in
fact
it
would
be
very
anomalous,
and
this
court
has
said
it,
for
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
have
locked
in
a
particular
mode
of
procedure
or
forms
of
practice.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
a
locking
in,
but
a
locking
into
the...
what
this
court
has
said
is
the
elemental
principles
of
the
jury
trial,
the
fundamental
basics
of
the
jury
trial,
not
the
forms
of
procedure.
this
court
has
said
that
over
and
over
again,
when
it's
upheld
a
six-jury
trial,
when
it's
upheld
jnov's,
when
it's
upheld--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--corrective
verdicts,
when
it's
upheld
partial
summary
judgments.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--when
this
court
has
considered
things
like
jnov,
partial
new
trials,
the
court
has
been
referring
to
the
reexamination
clause,
and
not
the
first
part
of
the...
and
this
court
has
never
said
that
its
jurisprudence
with
respect
to
taking
the
spirit
of
the
trial
by
jury
and
not
the
forms
of
practice
and
procedure
that
existed
in
1791
applied
only
to
the
first
half
of
the
seventh
amendment
but
not
somehow
to
the
second
half
of
the
seventh
amendment.
it
would
have
made
no
sense.
in
fact,
the
forms
of
procedure
by
which
jury
trial
results
were
examined
wasn't
dependent
upon
any
particular
practice
or
procedure.
as
blackstone
makes
it
clear,
the
idea
of
the
new
trial
was
for
the
purpose
of
the
preservation
of
the
jury
trial
itself,
and
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
the
confidence
that
the
people
would
have
in
this
most
elegant...
as
he
puts
it,
the
new
trial,
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
eliminates
these
inconveniences
which
could
occur
as
a
result
of
errors
or
excesses,
and
at
the
same
time
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
preserves
entire
and
renders
perfect
that
most
excellent
method
of
decision
which
is
the
glory
of
the
english
law.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
was
the
rules...
the
rules--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
suggests
exactly
why
there
were
new
trials.
the
concern
that
the
framers
had
with
respect
to
the
examination
clause
was
the
civil
law
procedure,
where
another
court
would
review
a
decision
of
a
court,
a
decision
tried
by
a
jury,
and
then
that
court
would
either
constitute
another
jury,
or
create
another
jury--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
there
would
be
a
series
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
i'm
suggesting
there's
no
better
chronicle
of
the
rules
of
common
law
that
existed
at
that
time
than
blackstone's
commentaries,
written
in
1768,
and
he
describes
the
rules
of
common
law--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
the
reason
that
i
mention
that
is
that
blackstone
had
a
reason
for
putting
that
hype,
as
you
put
it,
in
chapter
24.
he
believed
not
that
the
new
trial
was
something
that
was
terrible,
or
something
to
be
avoided,
or
something
that
was
an
inroad
on
the
trial
by
jury,
but
in
fact
it
was
an
important
component
of
the
jury
trial
that
there
would
be
these
retrials.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
under--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
he
thought--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--he
felt...
he
felt
first,
and
this
is
the
most
important
point
of
all,
is
that
he
felt
that
a
rehearing
before
another
jury,
to
use
his
words,
was
as
little
prejudice
to
either
party
as
if
it
had
never
been
heard
before.
he
felt
that
the
instrument,
or
the
instrumentality
of
the
new
trial
was
a
valuable
means
of
protecting
the
system.
as
to
whether
or
not
he
thought...
he
never
said
that
he
thought
it
was
important
that
it
was
the
trial
court.
the--
what
the
petitioner
is
arguing
for
in
this
case
is
that
the
trial
judge
have
the
power,
standing
alone,
to
determine
whether
there
would
be
a
new
trial
or
not.
that
system
never
existed
at
the
common
law,
and
what
existed
at
the
common
law
was
a
review
en
banc
by
separate
judges
that
would
exercise...
there's
reasons
why
he
uses
the
word,
supervisorial--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
agree
with
that,
and
this
court
said
it
best,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
guaranty
trust
case,
where
it
said
the
intent
of
the
erie
decision
was
to
ensure
that
all
cases
of
federal
court
in
diversity
jurisdiction,
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
in
the
federal
court
should
be
substantially
the
same
as
far
as--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
would
under
no
circumstances
change,
or
make
the
seventh
amendment
a
dead
letter
unless
the
judges
were
given
the
power
to
substitute
their
judgment
for
that
of
the
jury
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
damages.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
believe
that
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
based
upon
what
happened
in
this
case.
this
is
an
example
of
a
supervisorial
function
that
will
send
the
case
back
to
a
new
jury
unless
the
petitioner
accepts
the
amount
that
the
judge
said
was
the
maximum
amount
that
the
jury
could
award--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
seventh
amendment
would
not
tolerate
that,
and
this
court
has
said--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
talking
in
terms
of--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i'm
assuming
that
justice
scalia
was
asking
about
diversity--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it's
entirely
possible--
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
to
the
extent
the
legal
rules
can
determine
the
outcome,
the
differential
in
the
federal
court
should
not
be
different
than
the
state
court.
here
we
have
a
substantive
decision
by
new
york
exercising
its
legislative
function
that
in
actions
for
recovery
of
damages
there
ought
to
be
some
limitation,
some
equality--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--we
are--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--exactly,
and
that
the
grant
of
a
new
trial
in
the
first
instance
is
not
a
reexamination,
and
blackstone
did
not
consider
that,
and
he
said
that
in
so
many
words.
thank
you.
