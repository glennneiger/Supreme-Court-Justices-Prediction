scalia
mr.
abady,
do
you
know
of
any
state
that
does
not
have
a
rule
that
damages
must
be
reasonable?
in
other
words,
is
the
new
york
rule
something
distinctive
about
new
york
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
that
is
a
question
of
how
the
new
york
law
rule
of
law
is
enforced.
it
can
be
enforced
at
the
appellate
level
as
well
as
by
the
trial
judge,
but
as
far
as
the
substantive
rule
of
new
york
law
is
concerned,
namely
that
damages
must
be
reasonable,
is
that
at
all
distinctive?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
my
impression
that
every
state
has
such
a
rule
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
federal
government
as
well,
and
all
causes
of
action
under
federal
law.
do
you
know
any
cause
of
action
in
which
the
damages
can
be
unreasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
willing
to
say
in
all
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
do
i
understand
your
argument...
are...
is
it
your
argument
that
what
the
seventh
amendment
prohibits
is
only
appellate
review,
and
you
concede,
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
colloquy
with
justice
ginsburg
that
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
prevent
the
trial
judge
from
being
more
liberal
in
setting
aside
a
jury
verdict
than
the
common
law
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--simply
because
new
york
decides
that
judges
should
be
more
interventionist
than
the
common
law
has
allowed
them
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought--
justice
antonin
scalia
--isn't
that
the
premise
of
the
question,
though,
that
justice
ginsburg
was
asking
you,
that
if
new
york
chooses
to
allow
its
judges
to
be
more
interventionist
than
the
common
law
allowed
judges
to
be
with
regard
to
jury
verdicts,
judge
brieant,
here,
must
follow
new
york
law,
regardless
of
the
seventh
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
he
must
look
to
the
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
abady,
does
the
reexamination
clause
speak
to
punitive
damages?
aren't
you
biting
off
more
than
you
have
to
chew
here?
does
any
of
the
cases
at
common
law
that
you
cite
involve
punitive
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
do
involve
punitive
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
abady...
mr.
abady,
you're
urging
upon
us
very
strictly
the
words
of
the
constitution,
but
they
only
apply
to
review
of
jury
determinations
of
fact.
how
is
a
jury
determination
concerning
punitive
damages
a
determination
of
fact?
compensatory
i
can
understand.
this
person
has
been
injured
so
much.
that's
a
question
of
fact.
but
punitive
damages,
this
person
deserves
to
be
punished
to
a
certain
degree.
is
that
a
question
of
fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
punitive
damages
is
an
issue
of
fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
weren't
supervising
anybody.
they...
unless
you
say
somebody
supervises
himself.
those
courts
were
trial
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
judgment
entered
by
the
trial
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
judgment
was
entered
by
the
court
at
westminster,
and
the
closest
analog
to
current
practice
is
that
of
a
master.
justice
antonin
scalia
courts
review
judgments,
mr.
olson.
there
was
no
judgment
to
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
--according
to
your
opponent,
he
was
always
a
indispensable
part
of
the
review
if
it
was
to
be
set
aside.
you
do
not
have
a
single
case
in
which
it
was
set
aside
without
the
recommendation
to
do
so
by
a
nisi--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
the
nisi
prius
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
a
single
case
in
which
it
is
clear
that
the
nisi
prius
judge
did
not
recommend
the
setting
aside,
and
yet
it
was
set
aside.
do
you
have
one
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
that
case?
i'll
write
it
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't.
well,
then
the
answer
is
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
joseph
story
think
that
the
appellate
judges
didn't
have
this
power,
and
why
did
we
think
for
about
a
century
and
a
half
that
the
remittitur
could
only
be
granted--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course,
but
then
that's
not
an
appellate
court.
i
mean,
all
the
judges
in
1789,
all
of
the
judges
had
nisi
prius
functions.
they
all
had
trial
court
functions.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
need
to
give
them
all
that
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
it
meant
where
appropriate.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
gets
you
nowhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
says
every
judge
can
do
it
where
appropriate,
and
the
issue
is
whether
it's
appropriate
when
he's
not
the
trial
judge,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
words
of
the
1789
act
get
you
nowhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
olson,
that's
contrary
to
what
we've
at
least
said
in
the
past
the
court's
empowered
to
do.
we
said
in
the
fralock
case,
a
case
a
lot
closer
to
the
framing
of
the
seventh
amendment
than
we
are
today,
we
said,
if...
no
error
of
law
appearing
upon
the
record,
this
court
cannot
reverse
the
judgment
because,
upon
examination
of
the
evidence,
we
may
be
of
the
opinion
that
the
jury
should
have
rendered
a
verdict
for
a
lesser
amount.
if
the
jury
acted
upon
a
gross
mistake
of
facts,
or
were
governed
by
some
improper
influence
or
bias,
the
remedy
therefore
rested
with
the
court
below
under
its
general
power
to
set
aside
the
verdict.
that's
very
categorical,
and
it
says
just
the
opposite
of
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
that
involve
compensatory
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
am
i
permitted
to
think
that
punitive
damages
do
not
involve
a
question
of
fact,
whereas
compensatory
damages
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
both
are
equivalently
factual.
the
question
how
much...
you
know,
what
value
of
suffering
or
injury
has
this
person
undergone,
you
think
that
is
no
more
factual
than
the
question,
how
much
should
this
person
be
punished.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
at
all
a
question
of
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
at
all
a
question
of
fact,
how
much
somebody
should
be
punished.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr.
olson,
you
describe
the
history
as
though
it's
all
or
nothing
at
all.
the
factual
question
of
whether
$1,500
is
an
excessive
jury
judgment
is
either
reviewable
by
the
appellate
court
or
not,
whereas
the
historical
record
suggests
that
it
may
be
reviewable
in
some
contexts,
namely,
in
the
context
of
whether
the
judgment
can
stand,
whether
there
was
liability,
but
not
reviewable
in
another
context.
that
is,
in
the
context
of
whether
the
damages
are
excessive.
it
isn't
an
all
or
nothing
at
all
that
a
particular
factual
question
is
reviewable
by
the
court
or
not.
what
the
common
law
seems
to
xx
it
was
reviewable
for
some
purposes
but
not
review
purposes
of
determining
whether
damages
were
excessive.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
considering
the
en
banc
court
the
court
above,
and
i
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
walk
with
you
that
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
differ,
mr.
olson.
some
states
were
wrong.
that's
the
way
the
18th
century--
[laughter]
--mind
would
have
regarded
it.
there
was
a
common
law,
and
some
states
had
it
wrong.
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
first
part
of
the
seventh
amendment,
yes.
in
the
first
part
of
the
seventh
amendment,
which
simply
says
you'll
have
trial
by
jury,
and
what
constitutes
that
you
can
make
additions
and
subtractions,
but
the
second
part
of
it
is
so
unusual.
it
says,
shall
not
be
examined
other
than
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
means
you
can't
add
or
take
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
first
half
of
it
doesn't
suggest
that
you
can't
add
and
take
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
is
whether
he
believed
it
was
action
by
an
appellate
court
or
not,
and
i
believe
he
said
that
once,
and
elsewhere
he
suggests
the
opposite.
that's
really
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
no
doubt
that
he
approved
it
and
thought
it
was
excellent.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
question
is
whether
he
thought--
[laughter]
the
issue
is
whether
he
thought
that
was
action
by
an
appellate,
and
whether
he
was
correct
in
thinking
that
that
was
action
by
an
appellate
court
as
opposed
to
action
by
the
trial
court
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
well,
what
if
it's
demonstrable
statistically
that
juries
always
give
higher
verdicts
than
judges
would.
does
that
mean
that
the
seventh
amendment
becomes
a
dead
letter
if
a
state
decides
that
it
is
going
to
allow
its
judges
always
to
come
up
with
a
damage--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
are.
but
they
are.
as...
i
mean,
the
very
existence
of
the
seventh
amendment,
if
the
states
don't
have
it,
will
lead
you
to
a
difference
between
the
amount
of
money
you're
going
to
get
in
a
federal
court
that
has
a
jury
trial
by
right
and
a
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
state
abolishes
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
state
abolishes
the
jury
and
says,
we're
going
to
have
no
more
juries.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
would
the
federal
court
have
to
abolish
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
couldn't
abolish
the
jury,
could
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
get
vastly
different
results...
don't
you
believe
you
get
vastly
different
results
if
you
have
the
federal
courts
in
the
state
sitting
with
juries,
and
the
state
court
sitting
without
juries?
where
would
you
bring
your
lawsuit
as
a
plaintiff?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
you
think
that
erie
permits
that?
