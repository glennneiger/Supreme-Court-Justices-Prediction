justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
it--
--so
that
there
could
not
be...
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
district
judge
said
the
motion
to
set
aside
is
denied,
there
could
not,
in
your
view,
be
an
abuse-of-discretion
review
in
an
appellate
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
explain
a
little...
i'm
not
certain
how
you...
at
the
district
court
level,
everybody
agrees
it's
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
reasonableness,
right?
everybody's
agreed
on
that.
okay.
then,
if
new
york
were
to
have
a
law
saying,
and
no
jury
verdict,
no
damages
will
exceed
$1
million,
and
the
jury
gave
them
$2
million,
everybody
agrees
that
the
district
judge
in
a
federal
case
would
have
to
follow
new
york
law,
set
it
aside
over
the
million.
that's
a
legal
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
a
district
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
everybody
also
agrees
that
if
new
york
is
doing
the
same
thing
here,
the
district
judge
should
do
the
same.
so
that's
a
question
of,
if
this
is
a
substantive
cap
like
the
million
dollars,
the
district
judge
should
do
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
says
that
no
jury
will
be...
no...
which
says
that
no
plaintiff
can
get
more
than
what
materially
deviates
from
what
is
reasonable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that...
if
i
believe
that
that's
like
saying,
no
plaintiff
gets
more
than
a
million,
i
know
there's
disagreement
on
that,
but
if
i
were
to
think
you'd
lose
on
that,
and
it
is
substantive,
then
you
would
say
that
the
district
judge
is
supposed
to
decide
where
that's
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
they
made
a
mistake
in
thinking
that
the
comparable
thing
was
the
federal
appellate
with
the
state
appellate.
if
i
think
that,
the
comparable
thing
might
have
been
the
district
judge
with
the
state
appellate.
i'm
trying
to
get
that
out
of
it.
i'm
saying,
suppose
i
thought
that
it's
the
district
court
here
that
should
have
applied
the
cap.
then
what
i
want
to
know,
if
that's
so,
what
should
the
review
have
been
in
the
federal
appeals
court?
why
shouldn't
it
be
de
novo,
or
abuse
of
discretion,
or
nothing?
what
is
your
view
on
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason,
then,
that
that
is
not
this
case
is
because
you
think
it
isn't
a
soft
cap.
you
think
that
the
state
court
provision
is
totally...
the
state
law
provision
is
totally
a
procedural
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
for
erie
purposes
it's
procedural,
not
substantive,
is
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
where
does
the
standard
abuse
of
discretion
come
from?
i
think
everybody...
if
it's
procedural,
material
deviation
from
reasonableness.
if
it's
procedural,
it
drops
out,
you
lose.
if
it's
substantive,
then
erie
takes
over,
and
i
guess
like
any
other
legal
matter
the
district
court
applies
it.
then
we
review
the
district
court's
decision.
what's
the
standard
there?
i
take
it
you're
saying
the
standard
is,
where
did
this
abuse-of-discretion
idea
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
standard...
if
it
is
a
legal
matter,
a
legal
cap,
district
judge
applies
it
like
any
other
legal
matter,
appellate
court
reviews
it,
by
what
standard?
it's
not...
it's
just
a
straight
legal
question,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
that
isn't
the
characterization,
then
it's
procedural.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
mixed
questions,
like
any
other
mixed
question
on
the
legal
part,
probably,
but
not
always
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
this
particular
case,
judge
brieant
might
not
have
thought
he
was
supposed
to
apply
the
standard
of
new
york,
and
the
appellate
court
did
it
for
him.
i
guess
that
would
be
wrong.
they
should
send
it
back,
is
that
right?
