mr.
abady,
i
guess
you
agree
that
the
federal
district
court
had
to
look
to
new
york
substantive
law--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
the
cause
of
action
and
what
recovery
was
allowed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
the
law
in
new
york
been
determined
to
limit
tort
recovery
to
amounts
that
are
reasonable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
my
understanding
that
that's
the
case
law
in
new
york.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
that
a
matter
of
substance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
if
new
york
said,
no
tort
recovery
can
exceed
$100,000,
would
that
be
a
substantive--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
if
the
new
york
law
says
it
has
to
be
reasonable?
is
that
not
a
substantive
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
what
if
it
is
coupled
with
new
york
cases
that
say
it
must
be
reasonable--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
a
matter
of
substantive
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
initially
the
trial
court
judge
has
to
review
that
question
and
decide
it.
what
is
the
normal
federal
appellate
court
standard
of
review,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
what
is
the
standard
of
review?
is
it
no
reasonable
juror
could
have
reached
the
verdict,
or
is
it...
in
this
case
do
they...
they
were
looking
at
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
is
it
whether
the
trial
court
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
the
new
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
abady,
you
do
agree
that
at
common
law
there
was
a
group
of
judges
that
reviewed
the
trial
court...
trial
jury's
findings.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
is
true.
there
was
some
form
of
judicial
review.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
sometimes
that
review
was
conducted
without
the
judge
who
was
present
at
the
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
this.
on
the
federal
standard
of
appellate
review,
if
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
have
awarded
the
amount
of
damages
that
it
awarded
at
the
trial,
you
say
the
appellate
court
could
not,
based
on
that
determination,
upset
the
verdict?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
reasonable
juror
could
have
done
it?
