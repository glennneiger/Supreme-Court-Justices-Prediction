mr.
abady,
you
never
got
a
chance,
really,
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question.
what
is
the
federal
standard
of
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
point
is
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
there
is
no...
the
federal
appellate
court
has
no
power
to
set
aside
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
that's
what
browning-ferris
held?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
abady,
your
position,
i
take
it,
would
apply
equally
to
punitive
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
do
you
reconcile
it
with
our
decision
in
honda
that
due
process
required
excessiveness
review?
do
you
think
we
were
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about
whether...
do
you
concede
that
the
words,
common
law,
in
the
seventh
amendment,
refer
to
the
common
law
of
england
at
a
particular
time,
or
is
it
possible...
say
there
was
a
different
rule
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
1790,
so
they
even
let
legislatures
sometimes
reexamine
verdicts
at
that
time
in
our
history.
which
would
be
the
source
of
law--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
federal
common
law?
