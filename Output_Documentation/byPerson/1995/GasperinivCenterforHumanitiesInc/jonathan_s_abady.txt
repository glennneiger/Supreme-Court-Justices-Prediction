mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
appellate
court,
sitting
in
diversity,
may
apply
a
highly
invasive
state
standard
of
review
to
overturn
a
jury's
findings
on
compensatory
damages
in
the
absence
of
any
error
at
trial,
and
after
the
district
court
judge
has
considered
and
denied
a
rule
59
motion.
this
court
must
reverse
the
second
circuit's
decision
for
three
principal
reasons.
first,
the
second
circuit's
decision
to
apply
a
state
rather
than
federal
standard
of
review
violates
the
seventh
amendment,
the
rules
of
decision
act,
and
this
court's
precedent,
most
recently
reaffirmed
in
a
unanimous
opinion
in
browning-ferris,
where
it
was
expressly
held
that
in
a
diversity
suit
it
is
federal
and
not
state
law
that
governs
the
standard
of
review.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--yes.
yes.
state
law
controlled
the
substantive
law
which
governed
the
cause
of
action
and
the
elements
that
the
jury
could
consider.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
not--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--not
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
at
least
with
respect
to--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
at
least
as
to
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--yes,
that
would--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--that
would
be
a
substantive--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--not
if
the
determination
of
reasonableness
is
a
judicial
determination
by
a
reviewing
court,
as
it
is
in
new
york
under
cplr
5501(c).
5501(c)
is
a
standard
of
review.
it
is
not
a
substantive--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
i
think
that
the
critical
issue
there
is
who
defines
what
is
reasonable.
i
think
that
if,
as
in
this
case,
it
is
a
reviewing
court
that
is
making
the
determination
of
what
is
reasonable--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
under
the
seventh
amendment,
a
federal
appellate
court
is
not
permitted
to
reexamine
facts
found
by--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
most
of
the
circuits
are...
many
of
the
circuits
are
employing
an
abuse-of-discretion
standard,
but
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
permit
a
federal
appellate
court
from
exercising
review
where
the
claim
is
that
the
jury's
verdict
was
excessive,
or--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
there
is
something
distinctive
about
5501(c)
in
new
york
law--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--and
that
is
that
under
new
york
law
as
articulated
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
which
is
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--the
appellate
division
has
the
"final
word"
on--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--no--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--i
think...
i
think--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--i
think
that
the
substantive
law
in
most
states,
without
knowing
it
precisely
and
exactly
in
every
state,
i
presume
that
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--i'm
sure
it
is
in
all
states.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well,
not
a
lid,
and
that's
i
think
a
critical
distinction.
in
1986,
the
legislature
enacted
5501(c)
of
the
cplr,
which
provided
an
appellate
court
with
the
opportunity
not
to
impose
a
lid,
but
to
make
a
determination
of
what
it
believed
was
reasonable
compensation,
and
to
move
the
award
up
or
down,
and--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
i
mean,
i
think
you're
raising
an
interesting
point.
the
erie
analysis
that
the
consorti
court,
the
second
circuit
engaged
in,
which
was
the
decision
that
the
gasperini
court
relied
on,
did,
in
fact,
under
an
erie
analysis
indicate
that
its
decision
to
apply
state
law
was
a
function
of
the
erie
test,
but
there
is
a
threshold
question
that
must
be
addressed
before
one
can
proceed
to
the
erie
considerations,
and
that
is,
is
there
a
constitutional
provision
at
play
here?
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
is
what
a
state-created
right?
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
because
the
seventh
amendment
applies,
the
supremacy
clause
prevents
application
of
the
state
standard
of
review,
not
the
substantive
law.
the
substantive
law
which
determines
the
cause
of
action,
and
which
determines
the
elements
that
the
jury
may
consider
in
arriving
at
their
determination
is
a
function
of
state
law,
but
the
standard
of
review,
as
this
court
held
in
browning-ferris,
in
donovan
v.
penn
shipping,
and
in
byrd
v.
blue
ridge,
is
a
function
of
fundamental
federal
policy
and
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well,
the...
what
i'm
saying
is,
where
a
new
trial
motion
has
been
based
on
a
claim
for
excessiveness
or
weight
of
the
evidence,
the
seventh
amendment
prevents
a
federal
appellate
court
from
reviewing
that
determination.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
that
is
correct.
the
reexamination
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment
says
specifically
no
fact--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
i
think
browning-ferris
addressed
a
slightly
different
issue,
but
interestingly,
browning-ferris
did
indicate
that
this
court
has
never
held
expressly
that
a
federal
appellate
court
can
exercise
review
where
weight
of
the
evidence
and
excessiveness
is
the
claim
and,
in
fact,
it's
been
the
precedent
of
this
court
for
more
than
a
century
and
a
half,
and
a
precedent
that
has
never
been
repudiated,
that
a
federal
appellate
court
cannot
exercise
that
type
of
review.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
specifically
the
cases
begin
with
parsons
v.
bedford
up
through
fairmount
glass.
there
are
dozens
of
decisions
which
are
collected
in
our
brief
on
page
35
in
footnote
36--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--not
"no
possible
review",
but
the
seventh
amendment
imposes
a
division
on
the
review
responsibilities
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
under
the
seventh
amendment
is
entrusted
with
responsibility
for
reviewing
factual
issues
and
therefore
for
determining
excessiveness
and
weight
of
the
evidence
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
remains
available
to
review
and
supervise
questions
of
law.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well,
i
actually
think
that
there
is.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
the
seventh...
the
reexamination
clause
says,
states,
no
fact
found
by
a
jury
may
be
otherwise
reexamined
than
according
to
the
rules
of
the
common
law.
the
seventh
amendment
is
a
very
unique
amendment.
it
commands
that
we
must
look
to
the
common
law
for
the
meaning
of
the
scope
of
that
reexamination.
if
there
was
reexamination
at
common
law
by
appellate
courts
over
excessiveness
and
weight
of
the
evidence
claims,
then
contemporary
american
jurisprudence
can
exercise--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--but
it's
important
to
look
precisely
at
what
that...
what--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--there
was
judicial
review
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
the
only
way
that
a
new
trial
motion,
where
excessiveness
or
weight
of
the
evidence
was
the
claim,
could
be
granted
was
with
the
authorization
of
xx
nisi
prius
judge,
who
was
the
judge
present
during
the
trial
proceedings.
that
judicial
review
was
exercised--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--no.
no.
historically
and
factually
incorrect,
justice
o'connor.
there
is
no
case,
and
no
case
has
been
cited
by
respondent,
where
a
new
trial
motion
was
granted
by
the
court
at
westminster
without
the
express
certification
of
the
nisi
prius
judge.
there--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--a
court
of
appeals
is--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--a
court
of
appeals
is
not
in
a
position,
based
on
the
restrictions
of
the
seventh
amendment,
to
exercise
that
type
of
review--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--a
district
court
judge
is
empowered
to
review
that
claim
for
excessiveness,
and
may
look
to
state
law
for
guidance.
there
is
no--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
true.
the
rule
59
motion
was
fully
briefed
by
both
parties.
arguments
were
made
by
both
parties
before
judge
brieant.
judge
brieant
considered
the
rule
59
motion.
he
had
a
liberal
standard
that
he
could
employ
in
deciding
that
motion.
he
considered
it,
and
he
denied
it.
what
judge
brieant
recognized,
what
he
must
have
recognized
when
he
considered
that
rule
59
motion,
was
that
this
verdict
was
fully
supported
by
the
record
at
trial.
even
respondent's
own
expert
in
this
case
at
trial
provided
testimony--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--no,
because
judge
brieant
didn't
issue
a
formal
written
opinion,
but
the
case
was--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
judge
brieant's
a
very
experienced
article
iii
judge.
we
don't
know
exactly
what--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
that's
correct,
he
might
have,
but
there's
no
indication
that
he
exercised
his
discretion
and
authority
in
reviewing
the
new
trial
motion
improperly.
what
we
have
to
look
to
is
the
record,
to
see
if
the
record
actually
supports
his
determination,
and
when
we
look
to
the
record
in
this
particular
case,
what
we
see
is
that
even
respondent's
own
expert
at
trial
provided
a
basis
for
the
valuation
that
the
jury
arrived
at
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
no--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--no,
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
for
saying
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--exactly,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
judge
brieant
is
free
to
look
to
new
york
law
to
some
extent
in
exercising
his
discretion
under--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--the
rule
59
motion,
but
he
is--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--he
is
constrained,
in
fact,
by
the
common
law,
and
this
standard
of
a
district
court
judge
in
reviewing
a
rule
59
motion
is
a
properly
deferential
standard.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
i'm
not
sure,
justice
ginsburg,
what
your
question
to
me
is.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well,
i
think
the
determining
factor
is
not
how
it's
labeled
but
what,
in
fact,
is
the
actual
nature
of
a
substantive
law.
if
it
is,
in
fact,
substantive
law,
if
there
is
a
limit
imposed
as
a
matter
of
state
substantive
law,
that
is
controlling
in
a
diversity
suit.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
that
cannot
be
squared
with
the
reexamination
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment.
the
seventh
amendment
says
the
facts--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--i...
the
seventh
amendment
requires,
i
think,
that
the
jury's
findings
of
fact
be
accorded
great
deference,
and
that
they
cannot
be
altered
based
on
an
assessment
of
what
other
juries
have
done
in
other
cases
where
the
parties
in
this
particular
proceeding
have
not
been
a
party
to.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
because
the
reexamination
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment
imposes
a
powerful
and
definitive
restriction
on
how
a
jury's
findings
of
fact--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--not
substantive
state
law
standards.
the
states
are
free
to
pass--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--consorti,
i
believe.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes,
and
i
think
that's
incorrect.
it's--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--but
not
as
a
matter
of
state
substantive
law.
the
key
question
here
for
a
federal
court
sitting
in
diversity
is,
what
is
the
state
substantive
law?
that
applies,
and
the
jury
is
bound
by
state
substantive
law
that
determines
the
cause
of
action,
determines--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--but...
but
justice
ginsburg,
no
erie
analysis,
no
policy
analysis
under
erie
and
hanna
v.
plummer
can
displace
a
constitutionally
mandated
allocation
of
responsibilities
between
judge,
jury,
and
an
appellate
court.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
no.
i
think
our
position
is
fully
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
honda.
in
honda,
this
court
held
that
a
provision
of
the
oregon
state
constitution
which
prevented
judicial
review
violated
procedural
due
process.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
in
this
case
there
was
judicial
review
at
the
district
court
level.
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
an
appeal.
the
court
holding
in
honda
didn't
say
that
there
was
a
right
to
appellate
review,
and
how
could
it
be
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process
to
require
appellate
review
when
there's
no
right
to
an
appeal?
judicial
review
was
exercised
in
this
case
by
the
district
court.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
not
consistent--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--the
only
review
that
is
consistent
with
the
seventh
amendment
by
a
federal
appellate
court
is
review
that
goes
to
a
legal
issue.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
i
believe,
justice
souter,
that
the
seventh
amendment,
the
reexamination
clause
of
the
seventh
amendment
is
saying
exactly
that.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well,
because
ultimately
an
abuse-of-discretion
standard
would
require
a
federal
appellate
court
to
engage
in
de
novo
for
review
of
facts
found
by
the
jury--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--in
order
to
make
the
determination.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well,
again--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--again,
this
issue--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
the
key
in
the
command
is
contained
in
the
reexamination
clause,
and
the--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--some
of
them
do,
yes.
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes,
some
of
them
involve
exemplary
damages.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
a
district
court?
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
if
there
is
a
state
substantive
cap--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--no,
i
think
that--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--well,
i
want
to
be
clear
that
there's
a
distinction
between
an
authentic
state
substantive
cap
which
is
binding
in
a
diversity
action
and
which
is
actually
reviewable
by
a
federal
appellate
court
as
a
matter
of
law
not
only
by
a
district
court
judge,
but
this
standard
that
we're
talking
about
which
requires
an
appellate
court
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
jury,
which
is
not--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
if
there
is
a
state
substantive
cap,
and
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
what
we're
dealing
with
is
actually
a
state
substantive
provision,
a
state,
for
example,
that
the
cause
of
action,
that
under
new
york
law
on
a
particular
cause
of
action
a
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
more
than
$200,000
and
the
jury
awards
$500,000,
and
for
some
reason
the
district
court
judge
is
asleep
at
the
wheel
and
he
lets
that
verdict
go
through,
a
federal
appellate
court
would
have
as
a
matter
of
law
review
power
to
overturn
that
verdict
because
it
is
a
question
of
law.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
on
its--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--on
its
face,
it
is
clear
that
5501(c)
is
a
mode
of
appellate
review,
and
in
people
v.
bleakley,
the
highest
court
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
court
of
appeals,
have
specifically
said
that
5501(c)
is
the
provision
that
gives
appellate
courts
the
final
word
on
factual
issues,
and
they
describe
5501(c)
as
"the
linchpin
of
the
constitutional
scheme
in
new
york
that
allows
every
litigant
an
opportunity
of
at
least
one
review
by
an
appellate
court.
"
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
absolutely.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
i
believe
it
is
a
question
of
fact--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--justice
scalia,
yes.
the
law
is
given
to
the
jury
on
what
punitive
damages,
what
the
elements
of
punitive
damages
are--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--yes,
judge
scalia,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well,
this
court
has
indicated
that
if
there
is
any
standard
consistent
with
the
seventh
amendment,
it
would
be
an
abuse-of-discretion
standard.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
well,
because
i
think
the
strict,
proper
correct
reading
of
the
reexamination
clause
is
one
that
precludes
any
review
by
a
federal
appellate
court
of
issues
of
fact.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
i--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--at
best,
i
believe
that
an
abuse-of-discretion
standard
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
and
insofar
as
it
requires
an
appellate
court
to
engage
in
a
reexamination
of
the
facts,
it
is--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--inconsistent
with
the
reexamination
clause.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
yes.
i
think
to
the...
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
judge.
to
the
extent
that
that
review
requires
an
assessment
of
the
facts
found
by
the
jury,
it's
precluded
by
the
reexamination
clause
of
the
seventh--
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
--i
think
that
any
time
the
appellate
court
is
required
to
engage
in
factual
review,
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
permit
that.
mr.
jonathan
s.
abady
thank
you.
