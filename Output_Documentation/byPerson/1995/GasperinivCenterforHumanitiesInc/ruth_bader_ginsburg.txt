justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
abady,
didn't
new
york
specifically
change
its
law
for
the
express
purpose
of
getting
a
lid
on
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
very
field,
what
we've
seen
is
a
lowering
of
excessive
verdicts,
and
what's
startling
to
me
about
this
case
is
going
back
to
guarantee
the
basic
erie
message
that
you
are
not
to
get
dramatically
different
outcomes
in
state
and
federal
courts.
that's
core
erie,
and
here
you
have
the
possibility
of
getting
verdicts
that
are
widely
out
of
line
with
what
you
could
hope
to
get
if
you
went
into
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
abady,
is
this
a
state-created
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
suit,
the
claim
in
suit
is
based
on
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
you're
arguing
that
because
of
federal
procedure,
you
can
get
a
remedy
in
the
federal
court
much
larger
than
you
could
get
in
state
court
on
the
state-created
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
abady,
the
district
judge
is,
however,
and
if
you're
stressing
federal
procedure
and
the
seventh
amendment,
we
have
a
tension
here
between
the
award
one
can
get
in
a
state
court
and
federal
procedure.
isn't
the
logical
answer
to
say,
you
have
to
take
the
state
law,
but
fit
it
into
federal
procedure,
and
that
means
the
district
judge
has
an
obligation
to
do
in
the
federal
courts
exactly
what
the
appellate
division
would
do
in
the
new
york
state
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
district
judge
wasn't
aware
that
he
was
to
take
as
his
standard
for
reviewing
the
verdict
what
the
appellate
division
would
have
done
in
a
similar
case.
he
certainly
didn't
indicate
any
such
awareness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
he
compared,
as
the
second
circuit
did,
this
verdict
with
the
cut-down
that
the
appellate
division
had
done
in
similar
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
at
least
it's
possible
that
he
didn't
know
he
had
the
obligation,
in
effect,
to
take
the
place
of
the
appellate
division
when
he
reviewed
that
verdict
for
excessiveness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
might
have
thought,
just
as
you
did,
that
everything
that
has
to
do
with
judge
and
jury
is
federal
procedure.
never
mind
the
state.
we
don't...
seventh
amendment,
we
don't
look
to
see
what
the
state
does.
he
might
have
thought
that.
we
don't
know
what
he
thought
because
he
didn't
write
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
abady,
there's
no
general
common
law
here.
the
common
law
that
is
applied
is
the
law
of
new
york
state,
and
suppose
new
york
state
court
should
clarify?
this
change
that
our
legislature
made
is
in
effect
a
soft
cap
on
damages,
not
just
a
general
reasonableness
that
always
prevails,
but
we
have
in
effect
a
soft
cap,
and
we
regard
it
as
highly
substantive.
suppose
that's
what
new
york
courts--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--my
question
is,
suppose
that
is
the
new
york
law.
then
we
have
your
case,
so
it's
clear
that
new
york
regards
this
as
a
matter
of
substance,
that
it
is
a
soft
cap.
instead
of
being
no
more
than
$500
per
transparency,
it's
this
standard
that
the
appellate
division
is
to
use.
new
york
labels
it
substantive.
then
we're
in
federal
court
with
your
case.
what
must
the
trial
judge
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
abady,
for
erie
purposes
a
lot
of
things
that
are
categorized
as
procedural
in
other
contexts
are
substantive
for
erie
purposes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
idea
is,
you're
not
supposed
to
have
a
different
outcome
in
the
federal
court
on
a
state-created
right.
that
has
constitutional
dimensions,
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
sometimes
is
typed
procedural--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
if
we
were
back
in
the
era
of
swift
v.
tyson,
when
there
was
common
law
to
apply,
and
federal
courts
could
divine
it,
you
would
never
be
making
this
kind
of
argument,
because
the
reexamination
clause
would
control.
so
my
question
to
you
is,
why
are
you
emphasizing
the
possibility
of
appellate
review,
instead
of
saying
that
this
is
new
york
substantive
law,
and
fitting
it
into
the
federal
system
is
the
job
of
the
trial
judge,
and
that's
what
went
awry
here.
and
the
second
circuit,
instead
of
taking
it
on
itself
to
do
this
review,
should
have
instructed
the
trial
judge
that
that's
what
the
trial
judge
should
have
done.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
i
could
understand
your
argument
better
if
we
were
a
unitary
system,
as
was
england,
with
one
law,
but
that
has
to
be...
that
system
has
to
be
put
together
with
the
federal
system.
that
was
wholly
out
of
the
picture
in
the
common
law
model
that
you're
following,
and
you
seem
to
be
saying
what
you're
arguing
today
would
hold
as
much
in
an
fela
case
as
it
would
in
a
diversity
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
has
been
extraordinary
deference
to
jury
verdicts
in
fela
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
may
i
just
detract
you
from
that
for
a
moment
and
ask
the
kind
of
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
of
mr.
abady.
i
think
you're
biting
off
more
than
you
need
to
here,
and
do
you
at
least
have,
as
a
second,
as
an
alternate
position
that
even
if
what
you're...
what
mr.
abady
has
argued
is
right
for
a
federally
created
claim,
this
is
an
erie
matter,
and
therefore
the
federal
court
simply
can't
give
awards
that
you
couldn't
get
in
the
state
court
across
the
street.
