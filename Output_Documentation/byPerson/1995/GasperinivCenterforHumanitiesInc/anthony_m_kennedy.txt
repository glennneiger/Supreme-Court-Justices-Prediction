justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
that
limit
required
either
the
trial
judge
and
the
appellate
court
to
look
at
verdicts
in
order
to
make
them
comparable,
including
verdicts
that
have
been
rendered
after
the
verdict
in
question.
that
is
to
say,
if
it
comes
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
under
new
york
procedure,
they
look,
in
order
to
determine
comparability,
at
what
juries
have
been
doing
within
a
period,
reasonable
period
of
time
both
before
and
after
this
jury
has
entered
its
verdict.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
you
would
have
a
substantive
standard
that
could
not
be
implemented
in
the
district
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
use
comparable
sales
all
of
the
time
in
condemnation
suit.
why
can't
you
use
comparable
verdicts
and
determine
whether
or
not
there's
a
certain
amount
of
uniformity
based
on
an
after-the-fact
examination
of
the
verdicts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
there
are
certain
substantive
standards
that
cannot
be
implemented
in
the
federal
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this...
in
fact,
the
question
i
put
is
very
close
to,
is
it
cortini,
corsini?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
consorti.
in
fact,
isn't
that
what
the
court
held
in
consorti
that
it
was
required
to
do,
to
look
at
verdicts,
including
verdicts--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
were
rendered
after
the
date
of
the
verdict
in
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
it's
correct
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
let's
assume
it's
correct
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
they
could
order
that
the
trial
be...
that
the
case
be
retried
before
a
group
of
judges,
like
all
of
them,
or
an
en
banc
panel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
then
three
judges
go
out
and
retry
it,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
substance
of
the
common
law
or
the
law
today
is
that
there
is
a
large
element
of
law
in
a
damage
award.
that
is
to
say,
you
can
consider
reputation
in
the
community,
or
you
can't,
you
can
consider
pain
and
suffering,
or
you
can't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
arguing
that
you're
not
reexamining
a
question
of
fact
that's
tried
by
a
jury--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you
are
reexamining
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact?
