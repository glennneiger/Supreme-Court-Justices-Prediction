justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
you're
saying
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
limited
by
the
seventh
amendment.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the
standard
that
we
established
for
federal
review
were
no
reasonable
juror
could
find...
could
have
reached
this
verdict,
would
that
be
reviewable?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's,
i
think,
what
i'm
getting
at,
because
i
would
have
thought
that
the
abuse-of-discretion
standard,
and
review
of
a
rule
which
pegs
the
permissible
amount
to,
or
limits
the
permissible
amount
to
what
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
found,
raised
issues
of
law,
rather
than
the
kind
of
issues
of
fact
which
the
new
york
rule
does
issue...
does
raise.
i
mean,
i
concede
the
new
york
rule
as
being
a
rule
of
factual
review,
but
abuse
of
discretion,
no
reasonable
juror
could...
those,
i
would
suppose,
were
limits
of
law,
and
i
think
you're
telling
me
that
there
could
not
even
be
appellate
review
on
those
grounds.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
point...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
only--
justice
david
h.
souter
--only
in
the
limited
sense,
i
suppose,
that
we
engage,
or
an
appellate
court
engages
in
a
review
of
the
facts
on
a
directed
verdict
motion.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
can
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you...
they
can
do
that
under
the
seventh
amendment,
and
i'm
not...
i
don't
see
the
essential
difference
between
doing
that
and
engaging
in
either
of
the
two
avenues
of
review
that
i've
thrown
out
as
hypos
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
abady,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
relationship
between
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
questions
and
your
answer
to
mine.
you
said
in
his
case
that
if
there
were
a
kind
of
a
simple
dollar
cap,
nobody
gets
more
than
a
million,
the
district
judge
is
asleep
at
the
wheel
and
does
not
vacate
the
excessive
verdict,
the
appellate
court
may
do
so
on
review
of
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
or
may
reverse
him
and
remand--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
review
of
the
law.
why
may
the
appellate
court
do
the
same
thing
on
abuse
of
discretion?
that's
an
issue
of
law,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
why
shouldn't
your
answer,
then,
be
the
same
on
abuse
of
discretion
as
it
was
to
justice
breyer's
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
my
premise
was,
and
maybe
this
is
where
we
disagree,
my
premise
was
that
review
for
abuse
in
effect
is
review
for
an
error
of
law.
you
were
saying
on
an
abuse-of-discretion
standard
in
effect
no
reasonable
district
court
could
have
found
this
anything
but
excessive,
or
that's
your
question,
could
a
reasonable--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
that
is,
it
seems
to
me
is
an
issue
of
law,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
go
to
the
other
example
i
tried.
let's
assume
that
the
substantive
rule
in
new
york
is
no
verdict
may
exceed
the
verdict
that
a...
may
exceed
the
range
that
a
reasonable
juror
would...
that
a
juror...
that
a
reasonable
juror
would
find
appropriate,
and
the
district
judge
is
asked
to
remit
or
vacate
because
the
verdict
exceeds
whatever
that
amount
is
claimed
to
be,
and
it,
in
effect
it's
a
reasonable
juror
standard,
and
the
district
judge
does
not
do
so.
that
is
appealed.
is
your
answer
the
same,
that
that
is
really
a
mixed
question,
and
because
it's
a
mixed
question,
it
cannot
be
reexamined?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
seventh
amendment
precludes
any
appeal,
any
litigation
of
a
legal
issue
on
appeal
which
arises
out
of
a
mixed
determination,
then.
that's
your
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
wasn't
it
assumed,
and
haven't
we
consistently
assumed
that
if
there
was
no
clear
exemplification
in
american
practice
of
what
the
common
law
rule
was,
that
the
default
rule
was
english
common
law
in
1791.
isn't
that
the
default
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
to
that
extent,
there
is
a
locking
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we--
