chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
95-719,
william
gasperini
v.
the
center
for
humanities,
inc.--
mr.
abady.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
precedent
is
that
you're
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.--
--do
they
really...
what
proposition
are
you
citing
them
for?
i
know
they're
collected
in
your
brief,
but
are
you
saying
there's
simply
no
possible
review
of
a
jury
verdict
under
the
seventh
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
nothing
in
the
seventh
amendment
that
says
the
district
court,
the
trial
court
shall
do
one
thing
and
the
appellate
court
shall
do
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
abady.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
were
not
appellate
judges.
these
were
all
trial...
they
were
all
nisi
prius
judges.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
when
it
says,
either
judge,
which...
what
judges
are
they
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
two
judges,
a
circuit
judge
and
a
district
judge
sat
together
to
try
a
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely
not
a
court
in
which
the
case
hadn't
been
tried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
appealed.
i
mean,
a
district
court
in
south
carolina
couldn't
grant
a
new
trial
in
a
case
tried
in
pennsylvania.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
have
a
negligence
action,
a
diversity,
tried
in
federal
court,
and
a
jury
returns
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
the
district
judge
refused
to
set
it
aside,
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
is
of
the
view
that
no
reasonable
juror
could
have
found
that
the
defendant
was
negligent
in
this
case.
can
it
reverse
the
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
violating
the
seventh
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
olson--
--how
does
that
bear
on
the
language
that
according
to
the
rules
of
common
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
sound
like
the
rule
of
common
law.
it
sounds
like
perhaps
a
reason
for
why
they
had
some
rules
of
common
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
maybe
a
concern
that
led
them
to
adopt
the
second
part
of
the
seventh
amendment,
but
we
go
by
what
they
said,
and
what
they
said
was,
and
according
to
the
rules
of
common
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
sure
that
may
be
very
valuable,
and
perhaps
that's
governing,
but
we
don't
need
all
this
hype
about
how
great
it
all
is.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we've
never
held
the
seventh
amendment
applies
to
the
states.
states
can
abolish
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
the
case
is
submitted.
