but
mr.
rubinstein,
if
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
do
that,
wouldn't
it
have
run
smack
against
another
decision
of
this
court,
that
is
in
the
moses
h.
cone
case,
was,
what
sense
would
it
make
to
say
that
if
the
federal
court
stays
the
action,
then
the
review
is
by
appeal
under
the
cohen
doctrine,
but
if
it
remands,
then
either
there's
no
review
at
all,
or
only
mandamus
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rubinstein,
suppose
the
case
had
come
up
this
way.
allstate
sues
in
a
diversity
action
for
the
reinsurance
claims
that
it
says
are
due
it.
mission
then
puts
in
a
compulsory
counterclaim
and
says,
district
judge,
you
should
abstain,
and
the
district
judge
says,
i
think
you're
right,
and
so
i'm
going
to
stay
this
action
while
the
whole
thing
goes
forward
in
a
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
allstate
wants
to
take
an
appeal.
wouldn't
allstate
be
squarely
under
moses
h.
cone
in
taking
that
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
appeal
from
the
stay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rubinstein,
what
do
you
do,
then,
with
the
ninth
circuit
saying
to
this
court,
we're
puzzled.
you
have
moses
h.
cone,
which
indicates
it
should
be
appealed.
you
have
thermtron,
which
indicates
it
should
be
mandamus.
please
straighten
us
out.
which
should
it
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
sounds
like
an
argument
to
get
rid
of
thermtron,
too,
and
to
go
back
to...
which
i
think
was
your
very
first
position,
everything
comes
under
1447(d).
there
are
no
appeals
of
any
kind
from
a
remand
order.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
there
any
argument
about
that?
but
if--
--i
mean,
once...
if
the
federal
court
remands
a
case
to
the
state
court,
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
any
more
jurisdiction
over
it
as
far
as
i--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
donovan,
you
seem
to
be
making
a
very
good
outline
for
an
opinion
that
judge
norris
might
have
written
but,
in
fact,
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
defused
labels,
and
he
says
there's
a
bright
line
between
law
and
equity
and
you
can't
have
any
kind
of
an
abstention
when
you
have
a
case
for
money
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'll
have
to
read
the
decision
again,
but
i
had
the
impression
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
telling
district
judges
it's
all
very
easy.
if
it's
at
law,
then
there
is
no
abstention.
