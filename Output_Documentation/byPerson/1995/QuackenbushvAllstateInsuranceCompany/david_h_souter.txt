why?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
getting
it.
why
is
it
qualitatively
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
have
a
right
to
be
in
a
federal
court.
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
they
get
that...
whether
they
exercise
that
right
by
removal
or
by
an
action
originally
filed?
or
alternatively,
if
getting
rid
of
the
case
at
the
federal
level
is
a
final
judgment
for
one
purpose,
why
isn't
it
a
final
judgment
for
the
other?
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
far
as
the
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
it
is
absolutely
final.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
they
might
remand
again?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then,
if
you
don't
assume
that
it's
because
they
can
remand
again,
once
it's
out,
it's
out,
and
it's
just...
it's
out
just
as
finally
as
if
it
were
dismissed
as
an
action
originally
brought
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
absent
that
speculative
possibility,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
difference
between
the
remand
in
the
one
kind
of
case
and
the
dismissal
in
the
other.
why,
therefore,
should
we
treat
them
as
qualitatively
different,
as
you
were
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
speculation
that
a
federal
issue
may
arise
in
the
state
case
and
get
taken
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
qualita...
what
you
call
a
qualitative
difference,
which,
you
know,
assumes
a
qualitative
difference
relevant
to
this
issue,
is
simply
a
procedural
difference.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
decision,
the
reasons
for
making
that
decision
are
going
to
be
the
same
reasons
whether
the
case
got
there
by
removal,
or
whether
the
case
got
there
by
being
filed
there
in
the
first
place.
they're
the
same
reasons,
aren't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
each
of
these
cases
could
have
been
brought,
i
suppose,
in
a
state
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
the
court
of
another
state
other
than
california,
couldn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
true
that,
let's
say
if
allstate
wants
to
sue
on...
as
plaintiff
in
its
reinsurance
contracts
and
allstate
has
a
place
of
business
in
some
other
state,
it's
not...
it
doesn't
have
to
go
to
california
to
sue,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
discretion,
as
such,
make
the
difference?
why
shouldn't
the
difference
be,
should
the
discretion
be
exercised
one
way
or
the
other,
which
is
to
say,
no
abstention
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
no
categorical
reason
why
a
so-called
unflagging
responsibility
should
suddenly
flag
when
we
get
to
a
discretionary
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
no
reason,
in
principle,
to
say
that
discretion
is
the
determinant
here,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then,
then
it
follows
that
it
really
isn't
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
act
which
justifies
abstention
at
all,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
accept
the
so-called
unflagging
responsibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's...
i'm
not
getting
your
distinction.
