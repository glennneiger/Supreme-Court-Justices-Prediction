justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
this
case
dismissed
in
the
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
without
any
dismissal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thermtron
said
no
appeal
would
lie,
that
it
could
only
be
breached
by
mandamus--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--remand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
rubinstein,
if
it's
not
appealable
we're
not
going
to
reach
the
second
issue,
so
you
have
to
persuade
us
that
this
is
appealable,
and
to
do
that
you
have
to
overcome
what
the
court
said
in
thermtron,
so
i
would
think
that
would
be
your
first
line
of
attack
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
make
of
the
language
in
thermtron
on
that
point?
