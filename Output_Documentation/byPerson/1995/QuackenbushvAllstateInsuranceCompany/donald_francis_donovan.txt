mr.
donald
francis
donovan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
obligation
of
federal
courts
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
conferred
on
them
by
congress,
both
courts
of
appeals
and
district
courts.
i'd
like
to
address
the
holdings
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
turn,
first
that
the
district
court's
remanding
of
this
case
on
both
the
grounds
was
an
appealable
order
under
section
1291,
and
second
that
the
burford
doctrine
afforded
the
district
court
no
discretion
to
enter
that
order.
with
respect
to
appealability,
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
an
exception
under
section
1291
for
reviewable
remand
orders.
that
is,
remand
orders
that
do
not
fall
within
the
bar
of
section
1447(d)
and
therefore
are
reviewable
either
by
a
mandamus
or
appeal.
the
court
held
in
the
cohill
case
that
district
courts
have
authority
to
remand
cases
even
when
congress
has
not
expressly
authorized
remand
on
a
particular
ground
if
the
court
would
otherwise
have
authority
to
dismiss
that
case
in
order
to
allow
proceedings
to
go
forward
in
the
state
court.
the
district
court
here
exercised
its
authority
under
cohill.
it
could
have
dismissed
after
deciding
the
burford
motion.
instead,
it
chose
to
remand,
and
the
question
before
the
court
with
respect
to
appealability
is
whether
or
not
the
district
court's
decision
to
remand
rather
than
dismissing
means
that
its
order
on
the
burford
motion,
its
decision
on
the
burford
motion
is
reviewable
only
by
mandamus
rather
than
appeal,
as
it
would
be--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
the
language
in
thermtron,
your
honor,
as
we
pointed
out,
is
language
which
did
assume
that
an
appeal
was
not
available
and
therefore
mandamus
would
lie,
but
thermtron
has
to
be
understood
on
the
basis
of
the
case
that
it,
in
turn,
relied
on,
which
is
the
wiswall
case,
and
wiswall
should
be
understood
in
light
of
the
case
that
it
in
turn
cited,
the
comstock
case.
those
cases--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
i
think
that
the
language
in
thermtron
poses
a
difficulty,
yes,
but
i'm...
but
the
language
in
thermtron,
the
assumption
in
thermtron
that
in
fact
appeal
was
not
available
was,
if
it
was
a
holding,
as
close
to
dictum
as
a
holding
can
come.
it
was
not
argued
in
that
case.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
it
was
not
discussed
in
the
case.
it
was
not--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--in
a
technical
sense,
yes,
it
was
a
holding,
but
in
fact--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--we're
looking--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--yes.
we're
asking
that
you
at
least
go
beyond
the
holding
in
thermtron,
that's
correct.
that
single
sentence
in
thermtron
that
relies
on
wiswall
suggests,
at
least
as
to
finality
in
the
traditional
sense,
as
opposed
to
a
final
collateral
order,
that
appeal
would
not
be
available.
as
to--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--so
far
as
i'm
aware,
the
appeal...
you
have
held
in
the
waco
case
that
there
are
elements
of
an
appeal...
excuse
me,
from
a
remand
order
that
can
be
appealed.
the
waco
case
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
an
element,
the
holding
prior,
in
logic
and
in
fact,
in
fact
made
the
remand
available,
but
it's
true
that
in
that
case
the
remand
itself
was
held
not
reviewable,
but
the
substantive--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--decision
that
was
incorporated
in
the
remand
order--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--was.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
no,
the
court
has
not--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--what
we're
asking
is
to
apply
basic
and
fundamental
principles--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's
correct.
that's
correct,
and
the
reason
that
we're
asking
that
the
court
hold
that
is
because
it's
compelled
by
every
notion
of
finality.
the
question
here
is
what...
how
do
you
treat
section...
reviewable
remand
orders
that
are
not
barred
by
section
1447(d)?
if
you
look
to
the
court's
definition
of
finality
under
section
1291,
that
is
the
only
source
by
which
you
can
answer
that
question,
because
jurisdictional
course
is
conferred
by
congress,
and
if
you're
outside
the
bar
of
1447(d),
you
must
be
within
section
1291.
section
1291,
the
traditional
catlin
definition:
are
there
any
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
no,
there
are
not
going
to
be.
that's
the
very
purpose.
the
very
definition
of
a
remand
order
is
to
completely
end
the
case
in
the
district
court.
if
you
look
to
the
moses
h.
cone
decision,
they
are
effectively
out
of
federal
court.
again,
the
very
purpose
of
a
remand
order
is
to
move
the
parties
out
of
federal
court
fully,
finally,
expressly,
literally.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's...
well,
it
is
in
fact...
it's
only
technically
not
true
in
cone,
but
the
notion
that
the
case
continues
in
the
state
court
really
is
a
completely
formalistic
difference.
in
fact,
the
purposes...
we're
talking
here
about
jurisdiction
under
the
diversity
statute
in
the
federal
district
court
and
under
section
1291
in
the
court
of
appeals.
what
happens
in
the
state
court
really
doesn't
matter.
for
purposes
of
the
district
court's
decision,
there's
nothing
that's
going
to
happen
in
the
district
court.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
for
purposes
of
the
court
of
appeals,
1291,
this
is
a
final
decision,
because
it
is
all
the
district
court
can
do.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's
right.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's...
thermtron,
if
the
case
had...
if
the
court
had
looked
at
it
in
thermtron
i
believe
that
is
what
it
would
have
concluded.
for
purposes...
again,
for
purposes
of
finality,
whether
we're
talking
about
the
final
collateral
order
doctrine
or
traditional
finality,
what
is
it
that
is
final
here?
what's
final
is
the
district
court's
decision
on
the
burford
motion.
that
is
never
going
to
be
reviewed
again.
for
example,
in
the
final
collateral
order
cases
it's
generally
a
decision,
do
we
review
now,
or
do
we
review
later?
here,
it's
now
or
never.
for
all
purposes,
that
decision
is
final.
there
will
be
no
subsequent
opportunity
to
review.
so
it's
clear
that
under
the
court's
cases
again,
catlin,
final
collateral
order,
moses
h.
cone,
this
is
as
final
as
anything
can
be.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that
may
be
the
case.
i
should
say,
however,
though,
that
even
applying
finality
in
the
traditional
sense,
it's
not
clear
that
all
remand
orders
would
be
final.
it
would
suggest,
however,
that
a
remand
order
here,
because
all
that's
before
the
court,
a
burford-based
remand
order
where
a
district
court
has
exercised
its
exceedingly
narrow,
as
i
will
describe
in
a
moment,
discretion
to
refrain
from
going
forward
in
a
particular
case,
those
would
generally
be--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
for
example,
it...
i
think
it
remains
an
open
question
whether
or
not
a
remand
order
under
the
court's
discretion,
district
court's
discretion
with
respect
to
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute.
i
don't
think--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's
before
the
case--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
in
which
that
came
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
if...
for
example,
if
it
was
a...
the
supplemental
cases
pose
various
fact
circumstances.
frequently,
for
example,
the
case,
if
the
court
declined
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
after
dismissing
finally
the
federal
claims,
that
would
be
final
in
any
event,
and
i
think
there's
also
a
question
with
respect
to
the
1447(d)
bar
itself
with
respect
to
supplemental
jurisdiction,
because
there's
a
mention
actually
in
the
statute
not
about
remand,
but
there
is
a
mention
about,
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
not
yet
decided
whether
or
not
supplemental
jurisdiction
remands
would
be
subject
to
the
1447(d)
bar,
and
that,
again,
is
not
before
the
court.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
but
it's
a
question
that
may
eliminate
that
class
of
cases.
what
really
is
before
the
court
now,
i
believe,
are
cases
based
on
a
substantive
determination
that
clearly
would
be
a
dismissal,
for
example,
of
burford
abstention
motion,
or
perhaps
a
forum,
a
selection
clause.
i'd
like
to
go...
return
to
the
point
about
thermtron,
because
thermtron
itself
did
state
in
a
single
sentence
that
appeal
was
not
available.
it
did
so
in
reliance
on
wiswall
and
comstock.
in
order
to
give
effect
to
wiswall
and
comstock
today--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--i
don't
think
that
was
what
thermtron
was
talking
about.
thermtron...
the
discussion
in
the
last
part
of
the
thermtron
decision
about
whether...
how
one
reviews,
having
decided
that
this
was
clearly
reviewable,
did
not
rely
on
any
congressional
language.
in
fact,
it
relied
essentially
on
the
single
sentence
from
wiswall,
and
what
it
relied
on
was
the
notion
that
a
remand
order,
as
wiswall
would
have
it,
was
a
refusal
to
hear
and
decide.
that
is
the
same
kind
of
theory
that
was
applied
at
that
time
to
a
whole
host
of
orders,
including
the
comstock
case,
which
wiswall
expressly
relied
on,
demonstrates,
because
comstock
was
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction
case.
and
there
are
many
cases
of
that
era,
in
fact
the
other
cases
cited
in
the
margin
in
wiswall
are
all
subject
matter
jurisdiction
cases.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
i
think--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--we're
talking,
by
definition,
about
remand
orders
that
are
on
extrastatutory
grounds.
that
is
a
very
small
category
of
cases.
the
two
principal
areas
in
which
i'm
aware
from
reviewing
the
courts
of
appeals
decisions
are
forum
selection
clauses
and
burford
grounds.
those
are
decisions
that,
by
definition,
would
otherwise
be
substantive
decisions,
and
if
incorporated,
as
the
district
court
could
have
here,
in
a
dismissal
rather
than
a
remand,
would
be
generally
appealable
without
question.
so
again,
back
to
thermtron
and
wiswall
with
respect
to
the
function
of
mandamus
and
appeal.
those
cases
stood
for
the
proposition
that
a
refusal
to
hear
and
decide,
quote
unquote,
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
was
reviewable
only
by
mandamus,
and
that
was
the
point.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
they
held
an
appeal
did
not
lie.
there's
no
question
today
that
in
fact
a
refusal
to
hear
and
decide
on
the
grounds
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
or
personal
jurisdiction
or
burford
grounds
themselves
is,
of
course,
a
final
order,
and
a
quote-unquote
final
decision
within
section
1291,
and
clearly
reviewable.
mandamus,
on
the
other
hand,
today,
is
generally
regarded
as
an
unusual
means
of
interlocutory
intervention
in
very
unusual
circumstances
and,
in
fact,
the
kinds
of
standards
that
the
court
mentioned
earlier
during
the
course
of
mr.
rubinstein's
arguments
are
specifically
formulated
in
order
to
avoid
allowing
mandamus
to
become
a
means
of
evading
the
finality
requirement
of
section
1291.
in
light
of
wiswall
and
comstock,
in
general
finality
principles
there's
simply
no
need
to
apply
that
function
of
mandamus.
there's
simply
no
need
to
put
those
kinds
of
straitjacket
on
mandamus.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
thermtron
decision
itself,
thermtron
did
not
refer
to
any
of
those
formulations.
thermtron
said,
of
course
mandamus
is
available
here
because
the
district
court
has
improperly
refused
to
go
forward.
in
other
words,
if--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--if
the
court
were
to
hold,
we
think
erroneously,
but
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
mandamus
was
the
proper
remedy,
we
think
the
court
would
have
to
make
clear
that
mandamus
would
apply
in
the
wiswall-comstock
sense,
which
is
whether
we
issue...
whenever
a
district
court
does
not
go
forward.
but
it's
that
very
point
that
makes
it
clear
that
there's
no
reason
to
allow
19th
century
writs
to
interfere
today
with
the
basic
understanding
of
appeal--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's
true,
and
thermtron
did,
in
fact,
recite
the
language
from
the
earlier
cases.
but
thermtron,
again,
was
a
case
in
which
this
point
was
not
raised
by
the
court,
was
not
raised
by
the
parties,
was
not
discussed
at
any
length
at
all.
it
simply
quoted
wiswall
and
comstock,
and
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
look
at
that
case
in
light
of,
for
example,
moses
cone
and
the
whole
arena
of
finality
decisions.
in
fact,
i
think
it
is
important
to
do
so,
because
without
looking
at
that
sentence
and
examining
it
in
light
of
other
cases,
what
you
would
do
is
simply
confuse
the
law.
you
would
have
a
mandamus
standard
that
would
essentially,
would
have
to
recognize
that
mandamus
readily
issued,
as
wiswall
and
comstock
would
have
recognized,
when
a
court
improperly
goes
to
go...
improperly
refuses
to
go
forward.
but
you
don't
need
to
resort
to
mandamus
today,
because
it
is
well
understood
today
that
in
that
situation,
appeal
lies.
section
1291
says
a
final
decision,
and
that
kind
of
determination,
a
substantive
decision,
is
a
final
decision.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
i'm
going
to
get
to
the
merits
right
now--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--justice
scalia.
with
respect
to
the
burford
doctrine,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
burford
doctrine
afforded
the
district
courts
no
discretion
to
go
forward.
that
holding
was
correct
for
at
least
two
fundamental
reasons.
first
of
all,
neither
the
liquidator
nor
allstate
sought
any
relief
that
the
district
court
had
discretion
to
withhold.
secondly,
allstate's
removal
of
this
action
to
federal
court
had
no
effect
whatsoever
on
any
administrative
process,
on
any
attempt
by
the
state
to
formulate
state
policy
on
any
distinctively
local
issue,
and
i'd
like
to
address
those
two
points
in
turn.
if
you
look
at
this
court's
cases
in
burford
and
alabama
public
service
commission,
and
nopsi,
and
also
the
brief
treatment
of
the
burford
doctrine
in
lumbermen's
mutual,
it
becomes
very
clear
what
the
purpose,
the
justification,
and
the
scope
of
the
burford
doctrine
is,
for
the
court
explained
very
clearly
in
nopsi
a
federal
district
court
simply
does
not
have
discretion
to
abstain.
what
a
federal
court
does
have
is
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
grant
particular
types
of
relief,
whether
or
not
to
give
a
particular
remedy.
in
the
burford
doctrine
specifically,
the
burford
doctrine
recognizes
that
a
court
may
have
discretion
to
withhold
injunctive
relief.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
my
apologies.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
my
apologies.
what...
the
burford
doctrine
recognizes
a
specific
type
of
discretion
in
the
district
courts,
and
that
is
to
withhold
injunctive
or
other
discretionary
relief
where
that
relief
would
interfere
with
state
policymaking
on
distinctively
local
concerns.
i'd
like
to
address
those
two
points
in
turn.
first,
it...
there's
some
question,
i
believe,
whether
or
not
the...
this
point
is
one
that
can
ever
arise
in
a
remand
situation.
the
rule
of
burford,
the
burford
doctrine,
this
is
not
about
labels.
the
liquidator
continually
accuses
the
court
of
appeals
of
relying
on
a
label,
but
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
did
not.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
look
at
the
nature
of
the
action
before
the
district
court,
and
the
purpose
of
the
burford
doctrine,
and
it
held
they
didn't
fit.
it
cannot
be
a
matter
of
labels,
and
it
surely
is
not
a
matter
of
the
formal
merger
of
law
and
equity.
that
did
not
change
the
substantive
principles
applicable
to
the
grant
of
injunctive
relief.
this
is
a
matter...
the
issue
here
is
the...
balancing
a
federal
court's
obligation,
virtually
unflagging
as
it's
always
described,
to
go
forward
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction,
and
on
the
other
hand,
it's
discretion,
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
grant
particular
types
of
relief.
it's
hard
to
see--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
i
think
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--they're
not...
but
what
they're
not...
however
many
exceptions
there
may
be,
what
the
teaching
of
nopsi
said,
and
what
it
clearly
is
not,
is
some
kind
of
freewheeling
authority
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
to
weigh
a
little
state
law
here
and
a
little
inconvenience
to
the
liquidator
there.
it
is
a
requirement
that
the
court
rigorously
identify
some
source
of
discretion
that
will
allow
it
not
to
go
forward.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
discretion
matters
because
it's
only
discretion
that
can
legitimize
a
decision
to
go
forward.
if
the
court
does
not
have
discretion
whether
or
not
to
grant
the
request
of
relief,
then
it
has,
pursuant
to
the
diversity
statute,
an
obligation
to
go
forward
and
exercise
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
that's
right,
and
that's
why--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that's
why
in
the
first
statement
in
the
court's
nopsi
decision
is
a
flat
statement
that
a
district
court
simply
does
not
have--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--it
is
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--it
is
not
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
act.
it
is
whether
or
not
a
court
has
some
element
of
discretion
in
affording
a
particular
type
of
relief.
for
example,
one
cannot--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--well,
as
i...
for
example,
the
liquidator
has
argued
here
that
the
court...
the
district
court
should
be
understood
to
be
exercising
equitable
discretion
whenever
it
abstains.
that's
circular
reasoning.
one
can't
characterize
the
act
as
discretionary
and
therefore
justify
the
exercise
of
discretion.
what
the
court
has
taught
in
nopsi
is
that
you
need
to
identify
discretion
in
withholding
a
particular
type
of
relief.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
the
difficulty...
first
of
all,
the...
as
we've
explained
in
the
brief,
california
has
not
centralized.
they
have
not
purported
to
do
so.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
the...
there
is
a
court
in
california
which
is
handling
the
liquidation
proceedings.
that
court
does
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
it's
authorized
the
liquidator
to
sue
elsewhere,
and
in
fact
it
couldn't
arrogate
to
itself
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
feeding
federal
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
authority.
this
action
was
filed
as
a
separate
action,
and
is
not
part
of
the
liquidation
proceeding,
but
let's
get
past
those
points.
the
reason
why
that
argument
fails
under
the
burford
doctrine
is,
the
burford
case
was
about
a
very
specific
circumstance.
the
court
held
that
a
federal
district
court
would
have
discretion
to
withhold
injunctive
relief
where
the
federal
plaintiff
comes
into
court
and
asks
the
federal
court
to
interfere
with
state
administrative
processes
that
were
ongoing.
now,
there
was
a
specific
circumstance
as
well
in
the
state
administrative
processes.
that
is,
the
nature
of
the
oil
wells
were
such
that
you
couldn't
grant
a
well...
a
permit
to
a
well-holder
here
without
affecting
how
much
pressure
there
was
in
the
well
there.
they
were
necessarily
interconnected,
and
that--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--but
that
would
affect
only
in
the
sense
that
any...
that
does
not
affect
the
absolute...
the
rights
under
a
contract.
what
happens
here,
it
doesn't
affect
california's
regulation.
if
you
step
back,
there
are
stark
differences
between
what
was
going
on
in
burford.
first
of
all,
as
i
said,
what
burford
involved
was
interference
in
nopsi...
was
administrative
process.
there
is
no
administrative
process
here.
allstate
is
not
attempting
to
interfere
with
the
liquidator's
exercise
of
his
regulatory
responsibilities
in
any
way.
it's
not
going
to
federal
court
to
ask
the
court
to
issue
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
liquidator
from
doing
something.
it's
going
to
federal
court
to
ask
the
court
to
resolve
a
straightforward
commercial
action,
and
in
that
commercial
action,
allstate
will
have
to
prove
facts
and
argue
law
just
like
the
liquidator.
they
will
be
equal
before
them.
they're
not...
allstate's
not
trying
to
interfere.
we're
not,
for
example,
going
and
saying,
the
liquidator
can't
go
forward
with
his
liquidation
in
state
court.
we're
not
interfering
in
any
way
with
the
regulatory
capacity.
secondly,
there
isn't
any
administrative
proceeding.
this
is
a
civil
action,
pure
and
simple.
it's
a
civil
action
in
state
court,
it's
a
civil
action
in
federal
court.
thirdly,
there's
nothing
distinctively
local.
yes,
mission
happens
to
be
in
california.
there's
no
record
as
to
where
its
policyholders
are,
but
the
important
point
for
nopsi
purposes
is
there's
nothing
distinctively
local
about
it.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well,
i
was
trying
to
respond
to
justice
breyer's
question,
and
just
to
finish
that
up,
the
last
point
is,
i
don't
think
there's
any
policymaking
here.
what
the
liquidator
is
doing
is
acting
like
trustee.
the
money,
if
he
recovers
from
allstate,
is
not
going
to
the
public
treasury,
it's
going
to
creditors
of
the
mission
or
the
state.
but
to
respond
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
very
carefully
explained
that
it
is
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought
that
justifies
any
exercise
of
discretion
to
go
forward,
and
here,
there
is
no
relief
that
would
permit
the
court
not
to
have
gone--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--i
don't
think
that's
the
case,
because
it
did
point
out,
for
example,
citing
professor
shapiro's
article,
that
the
common
law
prerogative
writs
afforded
some
discretion,
so
i
don't
think
it
did
make
that
sharp
distinction.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
well--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--it's
very
hard
to
imagine
circumstances--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--in
which
there
would
be
discretion,
witness
this
case.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
there's
no
case
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
i
think
the
only...
the
only
other--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--thibodaux
is--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--and
thibodaux
really
is
basically
pullmanlike
reasoning.
it
cited
pullman,
it
did
not
cite
burford,
and
as
importantly
as--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--that's
correct.
there's
also
a
line
about
postponing
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction.
on
the
merits,
as
well,
it's
an
entirely
different
case.
the
court
pointed
out
it
was
a
peculiar
and
special
circumstance
of
eminent
domain.
but
to
go
back
to
the
question,
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
relief
here,
what
do
you
have?
you
have
a
straightforward
commercial
action,
and
you
have
a
commercial
action
in
which
the
defendant
has
moved
to
compel
arbitration
on
virtually
all
of
these
contracts.
where
does
the
discretion
lie?
either
we're
right
on
the
contract
defenses
or
the
liquidator
is
right,
but
the
court
doesn't
have
any
exercise
of
discretion
in
that.
furthermore,
with
respect
to
the
motion
to
compel,
which
the
liquidator
in
his
reply
has
now
suggested
affords
some
element
of
discretion...
the
liquidator's
argument
is
a
stay
is
equitable
and
therefore
there's
an
equitable
element
in
the
case...
that's
wrong
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
federal
arbitration
act
cases
of
this
court
have
made
it
crystal
clear
that
a
district
court
has
no
discretion
to
stay
in
the
face
of
a
valid
arbitration
clause.
section
3
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
says
shall,
and
that's
what
it
means.
secondly,
even
if
the
district
court
had
had
some
element
of
discretion
in
refusing
to
go
forward
on
the
motion
to
compel
arbitration,
that
would
not,
in
turn,
confer
discretion
not
to
go
forward
with
the
entire
case.
what
the
district
court
should
have
done
here
was
decide
the
motion
to
compel.
with
respect
to
the
burford
motion
itself,
the
first
thing
the
district
court
should
have
looked
at
is,
do
i
have
any
discretion
to
withhold
the
relief
sought
in
the
motion
to
compel
arbitration?
clearly,
the
district
court
did
not.
there
is
also
no
other
case
that
could
possibly
have
supported
the
exercise
of
discretion
here.
mr.
chief
justice
pointed
out
the
fair
assessment
case,
but
that
case,
even
if
it
is
viewed
as
an
abstention
case,
is
reliant
on
a
long
line
of
comity
cases
in
a
very
particular
area,
the
tax
administration
area,
and
it
specifically
relied
on
a
holding
that
in
fact
a
declaration
under
section
1983
would
effectively
shut
down
the
tax
administration
system,
and
there's
nothing
remotely
comparable
here.
what
the
district
court's
opinion
really
relies
on
is
some
notion
that
the--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--no,
we
don't
acknowledge
that
fair
assessment
is
contrary
to
our
position.
what
the
court
in
fair
assessment
did
was
looked
at
a
series
of
cases
in
which
the
court...
that
arose
out
of
the
injunction
and
declaration
area
and
hold
that
a
particularized
comity
principle
applicable
when
plaintiffs,
federal
plaintiffs
sought
to
in
effect
shut
down
state
tax
systems
would
justify
a
similar
application
with
respect
to
a
section
1983
action.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
here,
nor
has
the
liquidator
really
ever
suggested--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--the
plaintiff
was
remanded
to
state
court
specifically,
without
regard
to
what
his
action
was,
but
it
was
regarded...
it
was...
the
assumption
was
that
he
would
have
an
adequate
remedy
in
state
court
and
was
therefore
referred
to
a
state
court
remedy.
what
the
liquidator
has
asked--
mr.
donald
francis
donovan
--i
think
the
respondent
was
completely
misunderstood,
both
that
case
and
its
exception.
the
court
made
clear
in
commonwealth
trust
company
v.
bradford
that
it
has
no
application
to
in
personam
actions.
the
problem
with
the
liquidator's
argument
here
is
that
this
is
a
classic
in
personam
action.
this
is
an
action
by
an
individual
on
a
contract
for
money
damages
against
a
legal
person.
that
is,
the
corporation.
that
is
classic
in
personam.
the
rule
of
pennsylvania
v.
williams,
penn
general
and
pennsylvania
v.
williams,
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
in
rem
jurisdiction
must
be
exclusive.
that
rule
arises
from
practical
necessity
only
when
the
court
can
actually
control
assets,
and
therefore,
that's
a
rule
that
by
itself
applies
only
to
in
rem
actions.
the
exception
acknowledges
that
in
some
circumstances
with
respect
to
in
rem
actions
a
federal
court
can
cede
control
even
though
it
acquired
jurisdiction
first
to
the
state
court.
that
has...
neither
the
exception
nor
the
rule
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
which
the
court
has
repeatedly
said.
to
the
contrary,
there
is
a
long
line
of
decisions
in
this
court
which
have
repeatedly
said
that
in
liquidation
contexts,
business,
insurance
companies,
trust
administration,
an
in
personam
claim
against
a
liquidator,
or
receiver,
or
whatever
outside
the
liquidation
or
receivership
court
does
not
interfere
with
that
court's
control
of
the
assets.
the
liquidator
argues
here
that
this
is
in
effect
in
rem.
he
relies
on
morgan
stanley.
that
was
a
case
to
recover
possession
and
control
of
mortgage
notes
that
were
specifically
in
rem.
it
was
a
full
faith
and
credit
case
as
well.
but
this
clearly
is
not
an
in
rem
case
and
pulling
a
couple
of
phrases
out
of
context
about
marshalling
assets
cannot
turn
it
into
one.
this
is
a
classic
in
personam
action.
it's
a
contract
action
against
a
corporation.
clearly,
this
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
court's
cases,
but
it
said
that
that
does
not
interfere
with
the
case.
what
this
case
amounts
to
is
a
simple,
commercial
contract
action
in
which
the
defendant
has
asked
to
compel
arbitration
on
virtually
all
of
the
contracts
at
issue.
the
liquidator's
argument
amounts
to
an
argument
that
because
there
are
some
state
law
issues
here,
or
potentially
state
law
issues,
and
because
it's
inconvenient
for
the
liquidator
to
defend
this,
he
is
entitled
to
remove
it...
to
defeat
allstate's
removal
to
federal
court.
there
is
no
authority
that
would
support
that
proposition.
there
is
no
exception
in
the
diversity
statute
for
state
law
issues,
clearly
not.
the
very
premise
of
diversity
is
that
federal
courts
are
fully
competent
to
decide
state
law
issues.
likewise
there's
no
convenience
exception
in
the
removal
statute.
clearly,
if
allstate
has
a
right
to
remove,
the
liquidator's
convenience
cannot
defeat
that.
the
case
comes
down
to
a
simple
contract
action
for
money
damages.
