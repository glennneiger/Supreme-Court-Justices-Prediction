i'm
not
entirely
clear
on
why
there
would
be
more
litigation
if
you
allow
federal
courts
to
get
into
the
act
instead
of
just
having
the
state
tribunal
do
it,
certainly
not
to
be
decided
by
the
commissioner
of
insurance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
can't
marshall
the
assets
till
he
knows
what
the
merits
of
this
very
basic
contractual
issue
is,
and
some
court's
going
to
have
to
decide
it,
and
may
have
to
decide
it
in
several
different
forums.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they'd
have
to
decide
that
by
the
same
rules
of
law
that
the
federal
judge
would
decide,
wouldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but...
maybe
it's
technical,
but
there
is
the
difference
that
in
the
remand
situation
the
litigation
goes
on.
it's
true
it
doesn't
go
on
in
the
federal
court,
but
the
case
goes
on,
which
wasn't
true
in
cone.
