chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-244,
charles
quackenbush,
california
insurance
commissioner,
v.
allstate
insurance
company.
mr.
rubinstein,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
you
should
say
the
most
recent,
rather
than
the
last.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
not
a
request
for
an
injunction.
it
was
a
request
for
legal
relief,
and
we
said
the
court
could
turn
it
down.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thermtron
was
mandamus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
have
the
dissent
in
thermtron,
which
did
not
prevail,
you
have
the
opinion
in
thermtron,
which
did
prevail,
and
then
the
ninth
circuit,
here,
is
even
further
over
than
the...
because
it
said
not
only...
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
mandamus
because
you
can
appeal
this,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
majority
opinion
in
thermtron
makes
that
quite
clearly
wrong.
that's
what
i'm
worried
about,
exactly.
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rubinstein,
you've
raised
two
questions
in
your
certiorari
petition.
one
is
whether
a
remand
order
based
on
abstention
is
appealable,
and
the
second
is
whether
the
abstention
powers
of
federal
courts
are
limited
to
actions
in
equity.
now,
if
this
couldn't
be
appealed
at
all,
then
i
suppose
you
don't
get
to
the
second
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
quite
a
different
standard.
in
an
appeal,
all
you
have
to
show
was
that
there
was
error
in
the
ruling
below.
in
mandamus,
you
have
to
show
a
clearly
established
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
known
that
it
could
only
review
this
order
by
mandamus
it
might
have
come
out
quite
differently
than
it
did
reviewing
it
by
appeal.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
its
not
appealable,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it's
not
appealable,
then
it
never
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
certainly
can't
do
anything
more
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
you,
to
get
to
the
point
you
really
want
to
make,
your
opponent
would
have
to
prevail
on
the
appealability
question,
and
then
you
would
have
to
prevail
on
the
merits.
what
do
you
want
us
to
do,
flip
a
coin
between
thermtron
and
moses
cone?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rubinstein,
in
your
brief
you
make
the
point
that
in
moses
h.
cone
there
were
separate
state
and
federal
proceedings,
whereas
here
there's
only
one
proceeding.
it
was
moved
from
state
to
federal
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
weren't
two
independent
proceedings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rubinstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
donovan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
we
should
repudiate
language
in
thermtron?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it
was
necessary
to
the
court's
reasoning--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
you're
asking
us
to
depart
from
the
holding
in
thermtron.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
never
held
that
any
appeal
will
lie
from
an
order
remanding,
have
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we
have
never
held--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--then,
that
an
appeal
will
lie
from
a
remand
order.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
asking
us
to
do
that
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
asking
us
to
hold
that
an
appeal
will
lie
from
a
remand.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
orders...
what
remand
orders
would
not
be
final,
if
your
views
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
the
end
of
the
proceeding
in
federal
court,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
also
relied
primarily
on
the
statement
in
the
statute
that
they
shouldn't
be
reviewed
by
appeal
or
otherwise,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
going
to
make
any
difference,
then,
whether
a
remand
order
is
reviewed
by
mandamus
or
reviewed
by
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
thermtron
is
not
a
19th
century
case.
it
was
decided
about
15
years
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
virtually
unflagging
duty,
if
you'll
notice
in
color...
is
attended
by
about
half-a-dozen
exceptions,
which
makes
one
think
perhaps
it
is
not
a
virtually
unflagging
duty.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
say
the
respondent
wants
in
pennsylvania
v.
williams?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
donovan.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
