justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
we
have
to
overrule
thermtron
in
order
to
make
the
appeal
possible?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
but
don't...
that
poses
the
problem.
doesn't
that
pose
the
problem?
this
was...
do
i
not
understand
this?
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
remanded
the
case
in
light
of
the
burford
abstention,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
isn't
this
identical
to
thermtron?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
is
there
any
way
we
can
say
that
the...
wouldn't
we
have
to
say,
unless
we
overruled
thermtron,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
to
hear
this
case
because
it
wasn't
appealable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
do
have
to
overrule
thermtron.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
so...
but
it
said
you
could
only
review
it
through
mandamus,
so
you
couldn't
review
it
through
an
appeal,
and
here
they
reviewed
it
through
an
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because,
as...
that's
what
i...
what
are
the
merits...
you're
probably
almost
neutral
on
this
issue,
so
you'd
be
quite
helpful
in
looking--
[laughter]
in
looking
this
up...
we
had
a
case
in
the
first
circuit
called
garcia
which
raised
this.
we
looked--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
it
seemed
as
if
thermtron's
statement,
which
was
quite
brief
on
this
point,
grew
out
of
two
19th
century
cases,
one
called
wiswall
and
one
something
else,
which
was
making
a
very
old-fashioned,
since-discarded
distinction
between
mandamus
and
appeal
as
a
way
of
dismissing
jurisdictional
orders.
almost
as
old
as
law
and
equity,
really.
that's
right.
really
old
stuff.
and
the
difference
being
that
it
wasn't
followed
any
more,
except
in
the...
and
then
we
have
the
anomaly
with
moses
cone,
which
if
you
stay
it,
you
get
an
appeal.
if
you
don't
know
that,
you
don't
ask
for
the
stay,
you
can't
get
an
appeal,
so
it
seemed
anomalous,
plus,
perhaps,
overridden
by
events.
now
that
was
the
argument
for
not
following
it,
or
for
overturning
it,
and
so
i'm
putting
that
to
you
to
get
what
you
felt
were
the
strongest
reasons
for
following
it.
simply
stare
decisis,
is
it,
and...
which
is
a
powerful
argument,
of
course.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
frankfurter
says
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thibodaux.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
you
say,
just
so
you
can
get
the
main
thing
that
i
think
interests
you
the
most...
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
ask
this
for.
i
take
is
somebody
might
say,
this
case
here
is
a
simple
breach
of
contract
case.
you
have
an
insurer
that
has
some
reinsurance
contracts
with
allstate,
and
itself
did
some
reinsurance
with
allstate,
and
another
person
called
northbrook
who
may
reinsure.
it's
just
breach
of
contract.
the
contracts
have
an
arbitration
clause.
there's
no
reason
here
in
deciding
whether
to
go
to
arbitration
or
what
the
contracts
read
to
go
send
this
matter
back
to
a
state
court.
it's
run-of-the-mill,
simple,
every
day.
give
us
"our
federalism"
in
thibodaux
and
any
other
set
of
principles
you
want,
you
still
don't
have
to
send
it
back.
i'm
only
making
this
argument
to
get
your
response,
because
i
think
it's
at
the
heart
of
what
you
want
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--isn't
justice
stevens
right
that
the
litigation
goes
on,
but
that
this
is
the
paradigm
case
of
a
final
collateral
order?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
it's
really
appealable
under
cohen,
if
you
were
to
be
technical
about
it,
but,
of
course,
it's
not
more
nor
no
less
appealable
than
thermtron
itself.
thermtron
was
an
appealable
collateral
order,
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
a
simple
point.
you
keep
saying
1447(d).
i
take
it
that,
regardless
of
how
this
case
comes
out,
there's
a
statute.
we
had
one
in
the
bankruptcy
area.
these
statutes
prevent
most
reviews
of
remand
orders.
we're
only
talking
about
a
small
category
where
the
statute
doesn't
apply,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
am
i
right
in
saying
it's
a
small
category?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
in
saying
that
the
statute,
irrespective
of
what
we
do,
would
bar
most
reviews,
and
we're
only
talking
about
a
small
category?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
they
say...
i'm
just
trying
to
get
you
right
to
the
merits.
what
they
say,
i
take
it,
is
that
we
have
many
contracts,
many
contracts
of
reinsurance.
they're
not
all
necessarily
worded
the
same
way.
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
policyholders.
there
are
questions
of
interpreting
these
words,
not
all
of
which
are
the
same,
and
questions
about
whether
we
send
the
matter
to
arbitration.
the
answer
may
differ
in
different
cases.
in
order
to
protect
and
get
uniform
answers,
to
protect
the
shareholders,
the
state
of
california
has
centralized
judicial
review
in
one
court,
just
as
the
state
of
texas
had
done
in
burford.
and
there
is
no
difference
between
the
state
of
texas
in
burford
treating
a
claim
about
what
state
law
requires
in
terms
of
how
much
oil
you
take
out
of
a
well.
we
need
central,
uniform
decisions,
and
the
question
of
how
we
interpret
15
or
20
or
1,000
different
contracts,
whether
we
send
them
to
arbitration
or
not.
if
anything,
it's
more
complicated
here
in
texas,
not
less.
i'm
trying...
those,
as
i
see
it,
are
the
merits,
and
i'm
trying
to
see
what
your
response
is
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
said
in
their
brief
they
had
one
court,
one
single
court
that
reviews
all
the
decisions
coming
out
of
this
administrator.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
like
giving
money
to
one
policyholder
will
inevitably
affect
how
much
another
one
gets.
