justice
antonin
scalia
what
authority
do
you...
you
see,
when
you
say
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
whether
the
court
will
provide
relief
or
not,
i
don't
care
whether
you
call
it
equity
or
antiquated
or
anything
else,
the
crux
of
the
matter
is,
i
can
understand
this
abstention
doctrine
when
the
court
below
has
discretion
as
to
whether
it
wants
to
grant
relief
or
not.
then
the
case
is
brought
before
it
and
the
court
says,
well,
i
don't
have
to
grant
relief
even
if
you
have
a
good
case,
and
therefore
i
think
i
shouldn't
even
hear
this
case.
i'm
going
to
send
it
back
to
state
court.
that
makes
sense
to
me.
but
where
the
court
has
no
discretion,
where
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
judgment
from
that
federal
court,
where
does
the
federal
court
get
the
power
to
send
it
back
to
state
court?
it's
a
statute
that
says
the
case
is
removable.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
the
power
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
has
discretion
to
deny
judgments
that
are...
judgments
for
money,
has
discretion
to
say,
well,
you're
entitled
to
this
money,
but
i
just
think
i'm
not
going
to
give
it
to
you.
do
federal
courts
now,
under
this
new
order
of
the
world,
have
that
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
don't
care
whether
you
call
it
equity
or
not,
the
fact
is,
if
the
court
must
grant
relief,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
must
entertain
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
whose
discretion
doctrines
have
been
long-established
in
cases
where
the
court
was
able
to
say,
yes,
you
have
a
good
case
but
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
relief.
those
are
the
cases
in
which
that's
been
well
established.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
deferral,
i'm
talking
about
dismissal.
i'm
not
talking
about
simply
sitting
on
the
case
and
waiting
for
a
state
court
to
act.
i'm
talking
about--
--well,
i
think
the
court's
opinion
in
fair
assessment
supports
your
proposition.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
the
court
do
in
that
case?
did
it
dismiss?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
it
dismissed?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
my
recollection.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
they
do
go
in
different
directions.
why
should
we
adopt
one
rather
than
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
appealability
issue
now.
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
talking
about
the
appealability
issue,
the
first
issue.
why
should
this
be
nonappealable
as
you
say?
why
should
we
essentially
repudiate
moses
cone?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
rubenstein,
could
i
come
back
to
fair
assessment?
you
really...
i
had
not
thought
we
had
abstained
in
a
case
where
there
was
a
legal
issue.
i
don't
read
fair
assessment
as
being
an
abstention
case
at
all.
i
read
it
as
holding
there
is
no
1983
cause
of
action,
period.
the
opinion
says
taxpayers
must
seek
protection
of
their
federal
rights
by
state
remedies,
provided,
of
course,
that
those
remedies
are
plain,
adequate,
and
complete,
and
they
ultimately
seek
review
of
the
state
decisions
in
this
court.
this
wasn't
saying,
we're
not
going
to
decide
the
1983
action,
we're
going
to
let
the
state
courts
decide
it.
it
said
there's
no
cause
of
action
under
1983.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
a
different
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
do
you
explain
the
language
i
just
read
to
you,
remanding
them
to
their
state
remedies
provided,
of
course,
that
they're
adequate?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
state
remedy?
a
federal
cause
of
action
cognizable
in
state
court
is
a
state
remedy?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
never
heard
language
used
that
way.
i
mean,
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
might
be
anything
you
want.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it's
a
weak
case
for
the
point
you're
making.
do
you
have
another
one?
is
that
the
only
one
you
know
of
where
we
have...
although
the
statute
tells
us
to
entertain
a
case...
just
told
the
congress,
well,
you've
told
us
to
do
that,
but
actually
we
think
we
shouldn't.
thibodaux.
except
in
areas
where
we
have
discretion
not
to
give
relief.
what
about
thibodaux?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
court
dismiss
the
case
in
thibodaux?
did
the
court...
did
the
case
remain
in
federal
court
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
crucial.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
court
just
sat
on
the
case,
waited
for
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--court
to
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
went...
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
agree
with
you
on
this
and
hinge
it
on
the
cohen
doctrine
rather
than
saying
it's
a
final
decision
within
the
strict
meaning
of
1291,
it
would
not
be
the
case,
would
it,
that
all
remand
orders
would
necessarily
be
appealable?
we
could
still
apply
the
importance
prong
of
our
cohen
jurisprudence
and
not
permit
appeal
of
every
remand
where
the
only
issue
alleged
is
some
factual
issue,
as
opposed
to
the
quite
important
legal
question
involved
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
going
to
get
to
the
merits
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
knew
you
were.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
donovan,
if
you'd
stay
by
the
mike,
you
would
not
fade
in
and
out
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
not
get
seasick.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
like
the
warrant
requirement,
really.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
pretty
true,
though.
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
fact--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
usually
equitable
relief
in
which
courts
have
discretion
to
withhold
or
grant.
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
surprising
about
that,
is
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
you
stand
by
the
point
that
we've
never
done
burford
abstention
in
a
case
involving
legal
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
never
dismissed.
justice
antonin
scalia
thibodaux
in
fact
did
not
involve
a
dismissal,
did
it?
thibodaux
involved--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
deferral
of
action
by
the
federal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
last
line
is,
by
retaining
the
case,
the
district
court,
of
course,
reserves
power
to
take
such
steps
as
may
be
necessary
for
the
justice--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
a
retention
of
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
goes
to
your
other
point.
i
mean,
it
goes
not
to
your
appealability...
not
to
your
point
of
whether
it's
absolutely
precluded
if
nondiscretionary
relief
is
sought,
it
goes
to
the
point
of
whether,
assuming
it
isn't
absolutely
precluded,
should
it
have
been
granted
here.
but
you
acknowledge
that
fair
assessment
is
contrary
to
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
plaintiff
remanded
to
a
1983
action
in
state
court
in
that
case?
