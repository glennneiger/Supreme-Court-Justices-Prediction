mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
commissioner
quackenbush
is
the
last
of
a
line
of
several
insurance
commissioners
who
have
struggled
for
going
on
10
years
to
marshall
the
assets
and
to
effectively
administer
one
of
the
largest
property
and
casualty
insurance
insolvencies
in
the
history--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--exactly
correct,
your
honor.
however,
we
have
a
final
liquidation
dividend
plan
which
has
been
recently
approved
by
the
superior
court
in
california,
and
we're
hoping
that
during
commissioner
quackenbush's
administration
we'll
be
able
to
complete
this
case,
and
actually
the
issues
before
this
court
are
crucial
to
that
issue.
what
has
happened,
the
court
is
already
aware
because
we
have
explained
it
in
the
briefs
and
you're
aware
of
how
we
got
here,
it
is
commissioner
quackenbush's
position,
and
that
he
urges
upon
the
court,
that
the
ninth
circuit
erred
in
improperly
permitting
an
appeal
based
upon
an
antiquated
and
inappropriate
standard
distinguishing
between
equitable
remedies
and
legal
remedies
and
thereby
prevented,
or
would
forbid,
this
district
court,
and
any
district
court
in
a
similar
case,
from
considering
issues
that
legitimately
relate
to
abstention,
such
as
the
failure
to
recognize
the
need
for
a
consolidated
proceeding
in
a
state
court,
which
can
protect
itself
from
being
dissipated
through
dozens
and
in
this
case
it
could
have
been
hundreds
of
federal
court
litigations,
would
disturb,
and
in
fact
destroy,
a
fundamental
interest
of
the
state
of
california--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--assuming--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--assuming
the
hypothetical,
justice
scalia,
you're
exactly
correct,
and...
however,
the
question
comes,
is
there
a
federal...
fundamentally
the
question
is,
is
there
now
a
federal
court
of
equity,
and
the
fact
is
there
is
not
a
federal
court
of
equity.
there
is
a
single
district
court
which
sits
postmerger
with
equitable
powers--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--of
course
not,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--the
question
is,
what
is
the
power
of
the
court
to
grant
relief,
and
what
is
the
relief
requested
of
the
court?
in
this
case,
the
relief
requested
of
the
court,
the
key
relief
requested,
was
the
motion
by
the
insurance
commissioner
to
invoke
the
reasoned
discretion
of
the
district
court
to
apply
the
abstention
doctrines
which
have
been
long-established
by
this
court,
and
that
is
the
reasoned
discretion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
i
don't
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
under
the
principles
of
burford
and
under
the
principles
of
colorado
river,
for
example,
that
the
federal
district
courts
have
been
recognized
to
have
a
reasoned
discretion.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
precisely.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
that's
exactly
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
in
fair
assessment?
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
in
fair
assessment
it
dismissed,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
i
mean,
it
remanded,
your
honor.
what
i'm
seeking
here
is
an
affirmance
that
a
court
has
the
power--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--that
a
court
has
the
power
to
remand
the
case.
i
would
make
this
argument,
justice
scalia,
that
a
federal
district
court
in
a
case
such
as
this
case,
which
is
a
state
court
proceeding
which
has
been
removed
to
the
federal
district
court,
and
on
proper
motion
by
the
commissioner
of
insurance
of
california
to
invoke
that
court's
jurisdiction
to
remand
the
same
case
back
to
the
state
court
proceeding
is
completely
within
the
jurisdiction
and
the
discretion
of
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
no,
your
honor.
it
was
remanded
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
what
happened
was,
the
federal
district
court
remanded
the
case
and
took
no
further
action
other
than
to
send
it
back
to
the
same
state
court
from
which
it
came.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
not
in
our
opinion,
justice
breyer.
we're
not
opposed
to
this
court
overruling
thermtron.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
that's--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
in
the
broader
sense
we're
not
opposed
to
a
reversal
of
thermtron.
however,
thermtron
squarely
held
that
a
remand,
which
does
nothing
other
than
remand
the
case,
is
not
reviewable
by
appeal
but
only
by
mandamus.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
yes,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--in
the
sense
as
to
that
issue--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--yes.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
what
i
meant
by
our
not
being
opposed
to
overruling
thermtron
is
that
we
agreed
with
the
dissent
in
thermtron
that
the...
a
remand
order
should
be
totally
barred
from--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--being
reviewed.
however--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--the
majority
opinion
in
thermtron
said
that
a
remand
order
is
not
reviewable
by
appeal.
we
understand
that
to
be
the
law.
we're
relying
on
that
as
the
law,
and
the
majority
opinion
said
that
it's
only
reviewable
by
mandamus.
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
other...
ruled
that
it
was
reviewable
under
the
cohen
collateral--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--that's...
it
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
two
decisions
have
issues
that
are
not
exactly
on
all
fours
with
one
another.
however,
there
are
distinctions
between
dismissals
and
remands
as
we
understand
the
cases,
and
that's
how
we
find
that
the
cases
work
together.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
an
appeal
from
the
dismissal,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
yes,
your
honor,
and
part
of
the
demonstration
in
this
case
as
to
the
problems
with
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
that
in
another
case
arising
out
of
the
state
receivership
court,
the
morgan
stanley
case,
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
similar
situation
where
the
suit
was
filed
in
federal
district
court
in
the
first
instance,
and
we,
on
behalf
of
the
insurance
commissioner,
moved
to
dismiss,
the
ninth
circuit
did
dismiss
based
on
the
same
considerations
that...
the
same
type
of
considerations
that
the
district
court
remanded
the
instant
case
on.
and
so
it
therefore
seems,
looking
at
the
ninth
circuit
precedent,
that
had
this
particular
case
been
brought
in
the
first
instance
in
the
district
court,
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
sustained
a
dismissal,
whereas
because
it
was
a
remand,
the
ninth
circuit
refused
to
sustain
the
remand
but
only,
the
only
distinction
being
that
the
ninth
circuit
felt
that
the
district
court
would
not
have
the
discretion
to
remand
even
though
it
would
have
had
the
discretion
to
dismiss,
and
the
only
underpinning
being
the
perceived
distinction
between
law
and
equity.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
well,
your
honor,
i
think
we
do
get
to
the
second
question
because
it
was
reviewable
by
mandamus.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
urge--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--justice
ginsburg,
as
i
as
going
to
say,
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice's
characterization
so
far
as
it
went.
however,
we
urge
this
court
to
reach
the
second
issue,
because
the
second
issue
is
an
issue
which
permeates
not
only
this
case,
but
the
second
issue
permeates
all
similarly
situated
insurance
commissioners
across
this
country.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
well,
certainly
we
stand
on
thermtron,
and--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--yes.
we
say
it's
not
appealable.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
i
understand--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--mr.
chief
justice,
what
you're
saying,
and
justice
o'connor,
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
no,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--i
think
that
you
should
adopt
the
doctrine
that
this
court
established
in
the
penn
general
case
and
pennsylvania
v.
williams,
which
says
that...
which
we
cite
in
our
briefs,
that
in
the
case
of
an
insurance
insolvency,
that
the
federal
district
courts
do
have
the
reasoned
discretion
if
it's
appropriate
in
that
given
case
to
remand
cases--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--or
to
dismiss
cases
in
favor
of
the
underlying
procedures.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
i
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary
to
repudiate
moses
cone,
but
if
you
have
a
choice,
if
this
court
sees
itself
as
having
that
choice,
then
we
strongly
recommend
that
you
stand
with
thermtron.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
i
know
the
case.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
well,
stare
decisis,
of
course,
your
honor,
but
beyond
that
there's
a
question
of
giving
the...
recognizing
the
fact
that
the
district
courts
need
to
have
the
discretion
to
control
their
own
dockets
in
part
and
also,
from
the
position
of
this
court,
you
do
have
a
massive
judiciary
to
consider,
and
if
all
remand
orders
are
going
to
be
appealable,
then
the
number
of
appeals
in
the
federal
system
will
increase
by
3,000
or
more,
if
i
understand
the
data.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
well,
since
you
get
to
the
same
place
with
thermtron,
then
thermtron
satisfies
the
need,
but
there's
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
and
that's
it,
that
as
a
matter
of
substance,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
remand
order,
which
is
dealing
with
a
case
that
began
other
than
in
the
federal
system,
and
sends
that
same
case
back
to
the
system
where
it
began,
is
qualitatively
different,
substantially
different
from
a
case
that
begins
in
the
federal
system.
so
in
terms
of
wise
judicial
policy,
i
would
simply
rhetorically
ask,
what
sense
does
it
make
for
the
federal
judiciary
to
burden
the
federal
appellate
process
with
cases
that
really
started
somewhere
else,
and
under
abstention
doctrine,
should
go
back
to
where
they
started.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
that's
the
point
that
i'm...
i
just
was
trying
to
make,
is
that
the
remanding
of
a
case
that
started
in
state
court,
and
it's
the
only
proceeding,
sending
that
back
to
state
court
is
significantly
different
than
dealing
with
a
case
that
starts
in
the
federal
system,
at
least
in
terms
of
the
judicial
philosophy,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
why
should
we
burden--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--because--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--again,
the...
it's
not
final
in
a
sense
of
remand,
because
the
same
case
that
started
continues
where
it
began.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
well,
not
necessarily.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
no.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
your
honor,
i'll
accept
that.
i--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--over
that
particular
case.
however,
the
only
reason
that
i
say
for
purposes
of
argument
in
this
case
is
because
i
didn't
want
to
confuse
our
other
argument,
which
is
that
if
it...
if
this
state
court
in
determining
issues
such
as
arbitrability
or
contract
law
issues,
if
that
state
court
in
some
way
creates
some
federal
right,
the
same
case
in
essence,
not
procedurally
the
precise
same
case,
but
in
all...
in
substance,
all
the
pieces
of
the
case,
if
there's
a
federal
right,
that
federal
right
is
not
extinguished
by
the
remand.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
for
the
reason,
justice
souter,
that
i
said,
which
is
their--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
one
case
begins
as
a
federal
case
in
the
federal
court.
the
other
case
starts
in
state
court.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
well,
no,
because
the
intervening
thing
that
has
occurred
is
that
a
federal
district
court,
based
on
abstention
doctrine,
which
is
important
to
federalism
issues
and
comity
issues,
has
determined,
in
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
that
that
case
for
those
reasons
should
be
in
the
state
system.
if
this
court--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--well,
they're
not
precisely
the
same
reasons,
and
in
terms
of...
if...
in
the
terms
of
asking
me
if
there
are
any
other
differences,
that's
the
only
other
difference,
other
than
the
ones
i've
already
mentioned
to
justice
breyer.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
but
i
see...
it
may
not
be
enough
to
swing
the
argument
one
way
or
the
other.
it's
only
the
last
of
the
differences
that
i
can
discern.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
that's--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--that's
not
how
i
understand
the
case,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--well,
because
the...
the
cause
of
action
was
cognizable
in
state
court,
and--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--well,
in
some
instances.
i'm
not--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--well,
rico
is--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--rico
is
cognizable
in
both
systems,
and
is
rico
a
state
remedy
when
it's
in
state
court
and
a
federal
remedy
in
federal
court,
or--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--well,
thibodaux's
a
case
in
point--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--thibodaux's
a
case
in
point,
but
another
case--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--that
sounds
similar
to
the
point
that
you're
making,
your
honor,
is
colorado
river.
after
finding
that
none
of
the
abstention
doctrines
applied,
the
court
then
nevertheless
found
that
there
should
be
a
deference
to
the
state
proceedings.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
well,
i'm
not
going
to
rely
only
on
comity,
but
to
further
principles
of
federalism
and
to
promote
"our
federalism"
as
recognized
in
the
younger
case
and
concepts
of
comity.
that
is
the
source
in
the
rationale,
as
i
understand
it,
for
the
abstention
doctrines.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
well,
the
response,
your
honor,
first
of
all
is
it
would
subject
this
commissioner,
if
that
were
the
rule,
and
all
commissioners
similarly
situated,
to
dozens,
or
even
hundreds
of
litigations
in
various
federal
courts
across
this
country
and
possibly
even
to
litigations
in
other
countries.
it
would
defeat
california's
interest
in
an
efficacious,
orderly,
consolidated
rehabilitation
or
liquidation
process
in
insurance
insolvency
such
as
this,
and
it's
not
just
california
but
other
cases,
where
billions
of
dollars
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
policyholders
are
at
stake.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
i
don't
recall
precisely
at
this
moment--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
the
case--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--the
case--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--the
case
went
to
state
court,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
i
think
the--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--if
the
commissioner
cannot
marshall
the
assets--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--but
as
this
court
recognized
in
allied
and
bendix,
the
issue
of
arbitrability
is
a
matter
for
contract
law,
and
the
states
are
free,
and
in
fact
would
have
the
duty
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
arbitration
clause
should
be
enforced
consistent--
mr.
karl
l.
rubinstein
--no,
because
there
are
local
issues
involved,
and
particularly
where
we're
dealing
with
a
comprehensive
and
massive
insurance
insolvency,
the
issue
of
whether
the
arbitration
clause
stands
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
insolvency
clause,
and
how
it
interrelates
with
the
claims
statutes
of
the
state
of
california
which
require
a
certain
procedure
to
occur
with
respect
to
these
same
claims
in
the
state
proceeding,
that
also
would
be
shredded
if
all
these
cases
could
be
moved
to
federal
