mr.
james
b.
spears
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
respectfully
urges
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit,
which
was
based
on
a
proper
evaluation
of
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
in
that
case.
the
fourth
circuit's
test
for
a
termination
replacement
fact
scenario
is
particularly
important
for
several
reasons.
number
1,
it's
an
objective
test.
it
measures
whether
or
not
a
mere
difference
in
age
implicates
the
act's
prohibitions,
the
age
act
prohibitions.
number
2,
the
protected
nonprotected
distinction
incorporates
title
vii
principles.
it
is
not
a
new
concept
to
this
court.
number
3,
it
accommodates
the
reality
of
life
that
in
most
situations
a
younger
person
is
almost
always
going
to
be
replacing
someone
older.
that
age
difference
might
be
a
year,
it
might
be
half
a
year,
it
might
be
20
years.
that's
a
reality
of
life.
that
doesn't
come
out
of
a
court
decision.
that's
just
life,
and
it
doesn't
go
away
because
congress
passed
an
age
statute.
it
comes
into
focus
in
this
case
because
we
can't
change
that
fact,
and
courts
should
deal
with
that
fact
where
the
issue
of
discrimination
is
presented.
what
you
end
up
with
in
any
other
test
is
merely
an
age
difference,
where
they're
simply
pointing
to
the
plaintiff's
age,
whatever
that
might
be,
and
the
replacement's
age,
whatever
that
might
be.
that's
only
a
difference
of
numbers.
a
difference
in
numbers
is
never
sufficient
standing
alone.
there
has
to
be
more.
this
court--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--it's
a
starting
point
but
not
sufficient
for
prima
facie,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
in...
this
court
in
hazen
paper
i
think
makes
clear
that
the
essence,
the
particular
essence
of
the
age
act
is
differential
treatment,
and
differential
treatment
is
not
just
a
difference
in
numbers.
differential
treatment,
as
i
understand
it,
is
actually
a
difference
in
treatment
among
people
where
they're
similarly
situated,
and
similarly
situated
goes
to
a
number
of
things,
but
that's
what
the
essence
of
the
age
act
is
and
requires,
and
without
some
information--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--that
relates
to
that,
the
different...
the
numbers
alone
are
not
sufficient.
mr.
james
b.
spears
that
alone?
mr.
james
b.
spears
no.
there
are...
if
other--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--not
on
that
alone.
appropriate
other
circumstantial
evidence
would
have
to
come
into
play
and
suffice
to
show
that
there
was
an
intention
to
consider
the
person's
age.
mr.
james
b.
spears
i
can't
differentiate
between
those
two
because,
with
all
respect,
that's
simply
a
difference
in
numbers.
numbers,
when
it's
just
measuring
the
difference--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
spears
oh,
entirely.
i'm
not
arguing
for
any
different
standard.
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
appropriate
standard
under
the
age
act.
mr.
james
b.
spears
justice
o'connor,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
for
that.
number
1,
the
statute
itself.
the
statute
says,
a
violation
has
to
be
based
on
a
finding
that
the
individual's
age
was
the
cause
of
the
discrimination.
number
2,
this
court
in
hazen
paper
emphasized
that
it
would
require
a
finding
that
that
person's
age,
not
someone
else's
age,
be
they
25
years
younger,
or
6
months
younger,
but
that
the
plaintiff's
age
played
a
difference
in...
made
a
difference
in
that
decision,
and
not
only
played
a
part,
but
had
a
determinative
influence
in
that.
the
problem
with
simply
talking
about
younger,
whether
it's
substantially
younger
or
any
younger,
is
that
that
focuses
excessively,
in
our
view,
upon
the
age
of
a
younger
person.
mr.
james
b.
spears
and
that's
contrary
to
the
age--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--yes,
and
the
reason
i
think
that
case
is
appropriate,
even
though
you
can
always
construct
some
difference
of
numbers
that
might
appear
arbitrary
or
may
appear
even
nonsensical,
that
while
that--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--but
even
though
that
may
be
true,
it
focuses
upon
whether
or
not
there's
an
inference
that
the
plaintiff's
age
made
any
difference,
and
i
think
that's
what
he's--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--all
we're
saying
is
that
those
distinctions
alone
should
not
be
sufficient
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case.
if
the
plaintiff,
for
example,
shows
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
different
treatment
based
on
the
plaintiff's
age...
it
could
be
other
experiences
the
plaintiff
had.
it
could
be
other
instances
of
other
protected--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--well,
there
was
an
allegation,
and
that
was
the
heart,
the
center
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
and
they
felt,
because
the
actual
replacement
was
within
the
protected
age
class,
that
did
not
meet
its
test.
mr.
james
b.
spears
the
fourth
element
has...
of
course,
mcdonnell
douglas
facts
were
hiring
phase,
but
even
there--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--yes.
mr.
james
b.
spears
no,
but
it
did
say,
the
fourth
element
says
someone
who
had
the
qualifications
comparable
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
james
b.
spears
they
did
relate
to
some
extent,
even
in
a
hiring
context,
to
other
people.
mr.
james
b.
spears
and...
but
footnote
13
in
mcdonnell
douglas
i
think
anticipated
a
lot
of
confusion,
which
i
think
has
occurred,
and
said
different
claims,
different
fact
situations
will
call
for
the
different
formulations
of
the
prima
facie.
mr.
james
b.
spears
and
discharge
and
demotion
and...
yes.
whatever
the...
in
fact,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to...
if...
dependent
upon
the
facts
and
the
contingence
of
a
particular
case,
i
think
that
they
may
impact
that.
i
don't
think
there's
any
particular
prima
facie
specification
that
applies
in
every
hiring
case.
for
example,
in
the
fourth
circuit
there
is
a
case
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
fink
v.
western
electric.
that
was
a
reduction
in
force
case,
but
because
of
the
facts
and
the
contingents
of
the
parties,
the
court
in
that
case
designed
a
prima
facie
that
dealt
not
with
the
selection
for
the
reduction.
it
went
beyond
that
because
the
facts
and
the
contingents
of
the
parties
went
beyond
that.
it
designed
a
prima
facie
that
dealt
with
opportunities
after
the
prima...
after
the
reduction
occurred,
employment
opportunities
with
other
employers,
and
because
that
was
the
claim
of
the
plaintiff,
therefore
the
court
designed
the
prima
facie
test
around
those
facts
and
contingents.
that's
what
mcdonnell
douglas
directs,
i
think,
in
footnote
13,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
flexibility
is
exactly
what
the
fourth
circuit
i
believe
has
demonstrated.
mr.
james
b.
spears
yes.
mr.
james
b.
spears
no,
we
do
dispute
that.
on
the
third
element
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
mr.
o'connor
was
clearly
not
similarly
situated
because
he
had
just,
a
month
before,
had
his
territories
reduced
because
of
some
performance
problems.
he
pointed
to
no
one
else,
no
one
else--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--justice
ginsburg,
the
court
did
get
to
that
because
of
the
rule
56
summary
judgment
motion.
the
employer
went
on
the
offense
here,
which
it's
entitled
to
do
under
56.
it
presented
its
reason
for
the
decision
it
made
here.
that
required
the
plaintiff
to
deal
with
the
issues
of
similarly
situated.
mr.
james
b.
spears
justice
ginsburg,
the
entire
case
in
the
fourth
circuit
was
not
about
that.
mr.
james
b.
spears
that
is
the
issue
on
which
we
granted
cert,
but
i
don't
think
that
can
be
viewed
in
a
vacuum
here
with
regard
to
why
the
plaintiff
lost.
mr.
james
b.
spears
well,
that's
not
for
me
to
comment
upon,
whether
you
should
or
shouldn't.
i
think
the
u.s.
v.
aikens
case
is
an
exact
parallel
to
what
we
have
here.
because
the
rule
56
summary
judgment
motion,
the
employer
did
everything
it
would
have
been
required
to
do
even
if
the
prima
facie
had
been
met.
mr.
james
b.
spears
not...
well,
there
was
another
analysis
of
mcdonnell
douglas
under
writ,
but
beyond
that,
justice
souter,
the
rule
56
motion
required
the
opposing
party
to
put--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--yes,
for
that
reason
and
an
additional
reason,
because
rule
56
required
the
opposing
party
to
put
their
evidence
out
there,
the
court
evaluated
all
the
evidence--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--excuse
me?
mr.
james
b.
spears
that
issue
was
the
limited
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
james
b.
spears
but
that
deal
with--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--under...
that
he
failed
to
show
that
anyone
was
performing
at
a
level
equal
or
lower
than
him,
and
that's
under
the--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--the
fourth
circuit
concluded
he
had
not
been
able
to
point
to
anyone
else
similar
to
him,
similar
to--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--with
regard
to
the
termination
replacement
prong--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--well,
the...
under
the
issue
of
termination
replacement,
it
did
not
address
that
issue.
they
did
not
address
that.
mr.
james
b.
spears
on
the
termination
replacement
analysis,
but
there
were
other
analysis
which
makes
that
unnecessary.
mr.
james
b.
spears
i'm
saying
there
was
no...
as
the
court
is,
that
there
was
no
issue
of
that
because
the
employer's
explanation
was
undisputed.
he
had
had
his
territories
reduced.
mr.
james
b.
spears
well,
not
a...
but
when
summary
judgment
is
brought
forward,
then
the
evidence
has
to
be...
the
evidence
has
to
create
an
issue
of
fact
at
the
rule
56
position,
and
that's
exactly
where
this
case
was
ultimately
resolved.
mr.
james
b.
spears
right.
mr.
james
b.
spears
correct.
mr.
james
b.
spears
i
think
so.
mr.
james
b.
spears
it
sounds
real
good.
mr.
james
b.
spears
the
prima
facie?
mr.
james
b.
spears
it
should
be
neither
of
those
standards.
mr.
james
b.
spears
the
reasons
are
that
neither
of
those
standards
accounts
for
the
reality
of
life.
there
will
always
be
someone
younger,
or
almost
always
someone
younger
replacing
someone
that's
leaving.
that
reality
has
to
be
recognized
in
a
termination
replacement
context.
that's
why
the
protected
nonprotected
distinction
accommodates
that.
their
standard
doesn't.
it
ignores
it.
it
wants
nature
to
go
away.
it
just
wants
to
focus
upon
one
number
here
and
one
number
there
and
say,
and
whatever
the
difference
is,
that's
enough.
in
hicks--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--that
no
person's
age
shall
be
considered.
i
fully
agree.
mr.
james
b.
spears
no.
mr.
james
b.
spears
well,
i
don't
view
the
statute
as
mandating
any
sort
of
affirmative
action
for
older
people,
if
that's
what
you're--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question
the
first
time.
mr.
james
b.
spears
well,
i'm
saying
where
a
plaintiff
in
an
age
discrimination
lawsuit
relies
upon
that
difference,
that
reliance
simply...
and
any
test
of
a
prima
facie
doesn't
accommodate
for
what
frequently
happens
without
there
being
any
age
discrimination
clause.
mr.
james
b.
spears
that's
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
james
b.
spears
i
may
have
been
misunderstood.
i'm
not
arguing
that
mcdonnell
douglas
is
against
the
laws
of
nature.
that's
not
my--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--and
if
i--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--if
i
misspoke
on
that,
i
apologize,
and
i
apologize
for
any
confusion
i've
created
by--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--on
the
replacement,
if
that's
the
age
of
the
replacement.
is
that--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--no.
it's
not
that
broad.
with
regard
to
promotions
and
hiring,
i
don't
think
the
realities
of
life
are
necessarily
implicated
in
that.
mr.
james
b.
spears
for
a
termination
replacement
case,
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
precisely
what
they
said,
but
i
think
it's
limited
to
that.
i
don't
think
it
applies
to
hiring
or
promotion.
mr.
james
b.
spears
in
a
termination
replacement
case,
where
the
plaintiff
relies
upon
that
difference,
yes.
mr.
james
b.
spears
the
second
part
of
that,
justice
souter,
i
don't
think
is
correct,
and
we
don't--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--that
came
up
in
the
briefs.
mr.
james
b.
spears
well,
not
that
a
line
has
to
be
drawn,
but
the
line
drawn
by
congress
is
the
appropriate
line,
not
some
other
arbitrary
or
different
line.
mr.
james
b.
spears
and--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--where
the
presumption
of--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--right.
mr.
james
b.
spears
i
think
they'd
produce
results
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
age
act.
i
think--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--yes,
and
so
i
think
a
line
should
be
drawn
and
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
james
b.
spears
--drew
the
right
line.
mr.
james
b.
spears
that's
not
our
position,
and
there's
an
eeoc
guidance
on
that.
we
don't
disagree
with
that,
and
don't--
in
summary,
very
quickly,
the
lower
courts
here
examined
all
the
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
presented
which
was
required
because
of
the
rule
56
motion.
it
was
found
lacking
under
any
measure.
something
we
haven't
talked
about
here
this
morning
was
the
third
mode
that
the
fourth
circuit
used,
and
that's
under
traditional
methods
of
proof.
that
was
also...
plaintiff's
evidence
was
tested
under
that,
and
it
was
found
lacking
under
all
three
of
these
measures.
the
fourth
circuit's
test
we
think
is
clearly
appropriate,
because
it
supports
what
the
age
act
is
aimed
at,
and
that
is
age
only
discrimination.
it
keeps
the
age
act
from
being
distorted
into
some
sort
of,
the
older
you
get
the
better
your
case
gets,
therefore
your
prima
facie
case
gets
older,
because
the
older
you
become,
if
it's
simply
just
anyone
younger,
that
becomes
and
is
your
prima
facie
case.
the
fourth
circuit
readily
accommodates
the
mcdonnell
douglas
paradigm
if
it
has
to
be
used
to
the
realities
of
life.
we
think
that's
important.
footnote
13
to
mcdonnell
douglas
indicates,
and
i
believes
directs,
the
circuit
courts
to
design
prima
facie
standards
that
are
flexible
that
are
designed
around
the
facts
and
contentions
of
the
parties,
and
we
think
that's
very
important.
any
other
questions?
thank
you
very
much.
