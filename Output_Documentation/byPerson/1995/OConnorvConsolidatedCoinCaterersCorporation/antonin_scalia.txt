justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
why
he
needs
the
presumption,
given
the
facts
you've
stated.
i
mean,
if
he
has
his
employer
saying
you're
too
old
for
this
job,
does
he
really
need
a
mcdonnell
douglas
presumption?
wouldn't
that
be
enough
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know
under
mcdonnell
douglas
he
wouldn't
have
one,
but
what
does
it
take
to
establish
enough
to
survive
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
another
way
to
put
it
would
be
that
the
result
is
irrational,
which
is
what
you
charge
the...
your
opponent's
position
would
be.
i
don't
see
that
this
is
any
less
rational,
to
say
that
firing
somebody
54
and
replacing
them
with
somebody
53-1/2
establishes
a
prima
facie
case.
that's
just
not
rational.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
the
effect
of
this
prima
facie
case,
it
is
to
entitle
the
plaintiff
to
judgment
if
the
employer
does
not
come
forward
with
an
explanation.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
no
due
process
limitation
upon
that?
i
mean,
you're
telling
me
if
i
fire
someone
who's
41,
within
the
protected
class,
and
you
don't
even
know
who
i
replaced
him
with...
i
might
have
replaced
him
with
someone
60,
you
say...
that's
enough
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
the
mere
fact
that
i
fired
somebody
40,
and
if
the
employer
doesn't
come
up
with
a
reason
for
firing
him...
or,
i
mean,
maybe
he
just
got
up
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
bed.
that's
not
a
reason.
he
just
doesn't
come
up
with
a
reason.
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
come
up
with
a
reason,
and
you
think
that
we
can
give
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
in
a
case
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
you
like
due
process
of
law.
when
you
fire
somebody
who's
40,
you
have
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
arguably
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
the
reason
you
fired
this
person
who
was
40
was
that
he
was
40.
that
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
jury
is
able
to
come
in
with
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
based
on
nothing
other
than
the
fact
that
he
fired
someone
who
was
55,
hired
someone
who
was
54-1/2,
and
stood
mute
when
asked
what
the
reason
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
the
case
even
when
the
person
who
did
the
hiring
was
a
former
employee
of
the
employer
who
is
now
dead,
or
has
since
been
fired
and
is
antagonistic
to
the
employer
and
the
employer
says,
gee,
you
know,
it
was
one
of
my
agents
that
did
it,
he's
no
longer
with
the
company,
i
can't
give
you
a
reason,
and
you'd
say
the
plaintiff
would
still
be
entitled
to
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
hasn't
given
a
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
hasn't
given
a
reason.
he
has
said,
i
don't
know
the
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
listen
to
me.
he
has
not
articulated
a
nondiscriminatory
reason.
he
has
said,
i
have
no
idea
what
the
reason
was.
okay,
so
that's
the
answer
to
my
question,
too.
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
it's
not
a
big
deal,
39-1/2
or
40.
all
he
has
to
do
is
come
in
and
say,
i
don't
know
why
i
chose
the
guy.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wolfson,
those
courts
that
have
adopted
the
within
the
class
rule
that
you
have
to
show
that
whoever
you
fired
was
within
the
protected
class,
or
outside
the
protected
class,
i'm
sorry--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
they
applied
that
only
for
purposes
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
rule,
or
have
they
applied
that
as
a
substantive
test
for
liability
as
well?
can
you
do
the
one
without
doing
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
have
to
be
something
more
than
i
don't
know.
you
agree
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
enough?
i
mean,
you
use
the
phrase,
it's
false
and
it's
a
pretext,
to
mean
one
and
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
if
you
just
show
that's
false,
but
you
haven't
shown
any
evidence
of
age
discrimination?
you've
just
shown
how
the
employer
had
to
show
something
to
get
out
of
this
mcdonnell
douglas
hold.
so
he
came
up
with,
i
didn't
like
the
way
he
combed
his
hair.
and
that's
false.
is
that
enough--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
sustain
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
clear
what
we
mean
by
pretext,
though,
or
i...
i
think
what
we
mean
by
pretext
is,
he
has
to
show
not
only
that
it's
false
but
that
it's
a
cover
for
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
showing
that
it's
false
is
not
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
the
jury
conclude
he's
lying
because
the
procedural
gimmicks
that
we've
set
up
requires
him
to
come
up
with
an
answer,
whether
he
has
one
or
not?
you've
said
so
long
as
he
comes
up
with
an
answer
he
gets
to
the
next
stage.
if
he
doesn't
come
up
with
an
answer
there's
judgment
against
him.
why
wouldn't
a
reasonable
jury
conclude
that
an
employer
didn't
come
up
with
some
reason
because
we
told
him
you've
got
to
come
up
with
a
reason
or
we're
going
to
give
judgment
against
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
to
fill
out
the
numbers
of
hypotheticals,
we
should
add
to
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
a
hypothetical
of
someone
who
is
40
who
is
fired
and
replaced
by
someone
who
is
39.
as
i
understand
your
case,
you
would
allow
a
mcdonnell
douglas
presumption
in
that
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
a
fair
description.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
understood
this
law
to
be
against
nature,
if
you
consider
that
against
nature--
[laughter]
because
i
think
you're
probably
right
that
ordinarily
when
an
employer
fires
someone
who's
been
around
for
a
long
time,
he
tries
to
get
someone
who
will
also
be
around
for
a
long
time
and
tries
to
hire
someone
younger
as
a
replacement.
but
i
gather
that
what
this
law
says
is,
when
you're
replacing
a
65-year-old
you
have
to
give
a
67-year-old
as
much
of
a
chance
as
50-year-old.
and
you
cannot
discriminate
between
the
two.
so
i
think
your
view
of
natural
law
simply
comes
up
against
the
statute
here.
isn't
that
what
the
statute
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
when
you're
firing
a
67-year-old,
if
there's
a
69-year-old
who's
been
with
the
company
30
years,
and
you
tell
me
the
normal
employer
would
want
to
get
somebody
else
who'll
be
around
for
a
while,
the
statute
says
no,
you
can't
do
that.
you
have
to
hire
a
69-year-old
if
he
applies.
isn't
that
what
the
statute
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it's...
but
you
cannot
say,
you
know,
these
two
people
are
even.
i
can't
decide
between
the
two,
but
this
fellow...
i
want
somebody
in
this
job
who'll
be
around
for
30
years.
the
69-year-old
is
not,
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
take
the...
you
can't
do
that,
can
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
positing
that
it's
in
the
nature
of
things
that
when
you
fire
an
older
person
you
normally
hire
a
younger
one.
this
law
is
against
that
nature
of
things,
i
take
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
powell
will
be
glad
to
hear
that.
[laughter]
