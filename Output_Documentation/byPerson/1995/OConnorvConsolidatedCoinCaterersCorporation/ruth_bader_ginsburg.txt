justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
daly,
i
thought
that
the
fourth
circuit
said
that
that
was
just
a
sporadic
comment,
bantering.
it
wasn't
enough,
just
that...
there
were
a
few
isolated
comments,
they
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
daly,
you
said
that
all
of
the
circuits
adopt
the
mcdonnell
douglas
test,
but
they
don't
all
adopt
it
in
the
same
way.
they
all
have
to
make
some
adjustment,
because
it's
not
identical
to
race
or
gender,
and
some
of
them
don't...
some
of
them
say,
the
person
hired
or
promoted
must
be
younger,
and
others
go
beyond
that
and
say,
and
there
must
be
a
decent
interval
distance
in
the
age
of
the
person
not
hired
or
not
promoted
and
the
person
hired
or
promoted.
so
to
say
that
it's
mcdonnell
douglas
and
the
circuits
are
uniform
gives
a
false
picture,
does
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
daly,
why
do
you
say
that
considering...
what
was
the
difference
in
age
between
your
client
and
the
person
who
got
the
job?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
isn't
it
sufficient
for
your
case
simply
to
say,
you
don't
have
to
be
outside
the
protected
class,
that
the
person
who
got
the
job
doesn't
have
to
be
outside
the
protected
class,
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
on
the
second
step
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
there
are
cases
saying
what
that
reason
must
be
and,
as
i
recall,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
good
reason
as
long
as
it's
a
nondiscriminatory
reason.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
it
be
that
i
prefer
gregarious
people,
or
i
prefer
quiet
people?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
is
it
because
this
court
has
said
once
the
defendant
articulates...
not
proves,
just
articulates
a
nondiscriminatory
reason,
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
plaintiff
to
show--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
it
was
indeed
proscribed
discrimination?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
that
necessary,
if
you're
dealing
with
a
hiring
case
and
you're
going
to
apply
the
standard
to
a
promotion
case,
that
there
has
to
be
some
adjustment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
never
got
to
that
in
the
case
itself
because
the
plaintiff
here
was
disqualified,
was
he
not,
because
the
person
who
was
put
in
the
position
was
over
40?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then
we
wouldn't
even
have
the
issue
posed
on
which
we
granted
review.
the
fourth
circuit,
as
i
understood
it,
said
you
don't
fit
mcdonnell
douglas
because
the
person
who
got
the
job
was
not
outside
the
protected
class,
that's
number
1,
and
these
statements
that
you
have
put
in
are
stray
remarks,
so
you
don't
have
enough.
did...
there
was
no
finding
that
assuming
you
alleged
enough
you
didn't
prove
enough,
that
is,
that
you
didn't
prove
that
you
were
qualified.
but
i
thought
that
the
whole
case
was
about
whether
you
were
excluded
from
the
mcdonnell
douglas
formula
whenever
the
replacement
is
inside
rather
than
outside
the
protected
class.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
the
issue
on
which
we
granted
cert?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then
maybe,
if
plaintiff
lost,
if
that's
an
irrelevant
question,
if
plaintiff
lost
independent
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
then
i
suppose
you're
telling
us
we
should
not
have
granted
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
spears,
you
are
arguing
that
in
the
application
of
mcdonnell
douglas
there
is
a
bright
line
between
40
and
39,
and
if
the
replacement
is
39,
you
have
a
case,
and
if
it's
40,
you
don't.
you
are
arguing
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever...
whether
it's
a
promotion,
whether
it's
initial
hiring,
whether
it's
a
discharge
case,
the
line
you
are
drawing
is
between
the
39-year-old
who
gets
in,
and
the
40-year-old.
that's
your
case,
as
i
take
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
fourth
circuit
said,
don't
give
us
a
person
who's
in
the
protected
group.
if
you
give
us
a
person
who's
within
the
protected
group,
we're
saying
that
doesn't
qualify.
you
have
to
give
us
someone
who's
outside
the
protected
group,
meaning
under
40.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
case
that
we
have
here,
and
that's
why
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
understandably,
is,
you're
wrong
both
times,
because
it
doesn't
matter
to
you
whether
the
age
differential
is
20
years,
25
years.
as
long
as
the
person
who
got
in
is
40
or
older,
nothing
else
matters.
it
could
be
1
year,
it
could
be
25
years.
isn't
that
your
position?
