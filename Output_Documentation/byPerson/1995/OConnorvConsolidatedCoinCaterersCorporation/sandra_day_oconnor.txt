justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that,
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework,
a
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
he
was
replaced,
or
she,
by
a
younger
worker,
or
do
you
adopt
what
the
sg
appears
to
be
arguing,
that
a
plaintiff
doesn't
have
to
prove
that
he
was
replaced
at
all
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
obviously
we're
going
to
have
to
articulate
what's
required.
you
have
no
position--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
which
is
the
better
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
spears,
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
a
65-year-old
worker
is
replaced
by
a
41-year-old
worker,
that
it
cannot
constitute
a
violation
of
the
adea?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
well,
the
65-year-old
was
replaced,
and
he
claims
to
be
equally
well
qualified,
and
it
fit
the
other
mcdonnell
douglas
factors.
now,
do
you
say
that
there
can
be
no
violation
of
adea
when
the
replacement
worker
is
41?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
can
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
you
would
say
it's
a
different
case
if
a
50-year-old
worker
were
replaced
by
someone
39.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
gather
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
we're
reviewing
here
in
the
fourth
circuit
if
it
were
39
that
would
have
been
enough
for
a
mcdonnell
douglas
presumption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
why
should
it
make
any
difference
if
you
have
the
65-year-old
replaced
by
the
41-year-old
versus
a
55-year-old
replaced
by
a
39-year-old?
i
mean,
why--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we're
going
to
resort
to
some
kind
if
presumptions
based
on
inferences,
why
shouldn't
we
try
to
make
them
rational,
things
that
we
would
think
could
properly
lead
the
factfinder
to
infer
something
or
other?
i
don't
see
how
these
distinctions
make
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
keep
talking
about
that.
the
mcdonnell
douglas
so
called
factors
are
several
in
number
and,
as
i
understood
it,
anyway,
the
fourth
circuit
thought
everything
was
met
except
there
was
not
an
allegation
of
replacement
by
someone
younger
than
40.
