mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
lower
courts
ruled
in
this
case
that
any
older
employee
who
is
replaced
by
someone
who
is
40
years
old
cannot
rely
on
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
to
make
out
a
case
of
age
discrimination,
even
if
the
inference
of
discrimination
in
the
case
might
be
strong.
that
rule
makes
mcdonnell
douglas
useless
in
a
large
number
of
age
discrimination
cases.
and
it
particularly
hobbles
experienced
employees
who
are
at
the
upper
end
of
the
age
group
who
are
the
most
likely
to
be
the
targets
of
age
discrimination.
and
it
has
that
effect,
ironically,
because
congress
gave
the
act
a
broad
remedial
reach
and
it
extended
the
protections
of
the
act
to
include
those
who
were
40
years
old.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
theoretically
you
can
do
the
one
without
the
other.
that
is,
they've
only
applied
it
for
the...
only
the
fourth
circuit
is
really
what
we're
talking
about
that
has
the...
really
applies
it
totally
outside
the
protected
class
rule.
but
the
rationale
for
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
was
that
direct
evidence
of
discrimination
is
going
to
be
very
rare,
and
the
purpose
of
the
framework
was
to
allow
an
employee,
or
the
eeoc,
i
may
add,
to
use
mcdonnell
douglas
to
prove
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case,
which
is:
was
there
discrimination
or
not?
and
what
mcdonnell
douglas
recognized
is
that
in
most
disparate
treatment
cases
the
evidence
on
the
issue
of
the
ultimate
question
of
discrimination
is
going
to
be
pretext.
that's
the...
the
burden
of
proof
on
pretext
merges
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
ultimate
issue
of
discrimination.
now,
the
age
of
the
replacement
employee
is
relevant
to
the
ultimate
issue
of
discrimination.
it's
part
of
the
answer
to
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case,
but
it
is
not
the
complete
answer
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no,
and
in
some
cases
it
wouldn't
even
allow
the
plaintiff
to
go
to
the
factfinder.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no.
well,
yes,
if
the
employer
is
just
simply
mute
in
response
to
the
prima
facie
case,
but
i
can
say
other--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--if
a
plaintiff
makes...
under
hicks,
if
a
plaintiff
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case,
and
the
employer
is
entirely
mute,
then
judgment
must
be
entered
for
the
plaintiff.
but
i
can
tell
you
that
that
simply
does
not
happen.
in
other
words,
it
does
not
happen
and
the
employer
offers
no
explanation
whatever
for
its--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that's
correct.
it
has
to
be
an
age
neutral
reason,
and
after...
and
all
of
the...
the
only
effect
of
the
prima
facie
case,
really,
is
to
require
the
employer
to
offer
its
explanation,
and
then
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
answer...
in
effect
the
answer
is
never,
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
the
employer
may
say,
i
have
a
reason,
and
i
may
have
difficulty
proving
it,
like
the
situation
that
you
mentioned,
but
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
it
could
be
anything,
and
then
it's
up
to
the
employee
or
the
eeoc
to
prove,
on
the
basis
of
other
evidence,
that
that
reason
is
a
pretext
and
a
cover
for
age
discrimination,
and
if
there
is
no
evidence
of
pretext,
then
the
court
can
grant
summary
judgment
for
the
employer
on
the
ground
that
the
factfinder
could
not
return
a
verdict
of
discrimination.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no,
it's
not
that
the
factfinder
has
to
believe
the
employer's
reason.
the
burden
of
proof
of
discrimination
is
on
the
employee.
but
the
point
is,
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
if
the
plaintiff
says,
well,
i
was
55
and
i
was
fired.
and
the
employer
says,
well,
i
replaced
you
with
someone
and
i
replaced
you
for
what
to
me
is
a
perfectly
good
reason.
unless
the
employee
can
show
that
that
is
not
the
employer's,
not
the
real
reason,
and
that
the
factfinder
could
disbelieve
it--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
let
me
be
clear.
the
effect
of
the
prima
facie
case
is
to
call
upon
the
employer
to
offer
a
nondiscriminatory
explanation
for
its
action
against
the
employee.
that
is
all.
the
burden
then
is
on
the
employee
to
show...
to
prove,
by
a
burden
of
persuasion,
that
that
nondiscriminatory
explanation
is
false,
that
it
is
a
pretext.
only--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
jury
has...
the
jury,
ultimately,
but
only
if...
only
if...
it
only
gets
to
the
jury
if
there
is
some
evidence
tending
to
discredit
what
the
employer's
case
is.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
all
right.
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
it--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--if
the
only...
if
the
employer's
only
explanation
is,
i
didn't
like
the
way...
i
thought
he
was
not
gregarious.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
and
you
show
that
that
is
false,
and
that
there's
no...
the
evidence
suggests
no
other
explanation
such
as,
i
fired
him
because
he
was
not
gregarious
but
also
some
other
reason,
if
that's...
if
the
evidence--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
jury
decides
whether
it's
false,
but
there
has
to
be
evidence--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
i
don't
agree
with
that
because--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--applying
the
standards
of
rule
56
on
summary
judgment,
the
judge
can
determine
whether
there
is
evidence
in
the
case
tending
to
discredit
the
employer's
offered
nondiscriminatory
action.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no,
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
employer's
evidence
stands
alone
and
the
employee
has
offered
nothing
in
response
to
that,
nothing
to
rebut
that
explanation,
then
the
case
should
not
go
to
the
jury
and
summary
judgment--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
there
has
to
be...
there
has
to
be
some
evidence--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
there
has
to
be...
but
there
has
to
be
evidence
on
which,
if
an...
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
to
show
that
that
was
not
the
case.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
to
show
pretext.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right,
and
that
is
the
burden
of
persuasion
at
the
pretext
stage,
that
the
employee
has
to
come
forward
with
that
evidence.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
it
is
enough
if
the
only
explanation
that
the
employer
comes
forward
with
is
shown
by
the
employee
to
be
entirely
false,
and
if
there
was
evidence
the
employee
has
made,
because
then
the
factfinder
could
conclude
that
the
reason
why
the
employer
is
lying
is
because
it
was
engaging
in
age
discrimination,
but
there
has
to--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
that
is
part
of
the
fact
that
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion
is
on
the
employee,
and
the
employee
has
to
come
forward
with
the
evidence
that
the
employer's
offered
reason
was
a
pretext
for
discrimination.
i
want
to
point
out
that,
as
i
said,
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
there
was
discrimination,
and
the
effects
of
the
fourth
circuit's
rule
is
really
to
prevent
the
court
under
mcdonnell
douglas
from
reaching
that...
from
reaching
that
question,
and
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
is
intended
really
to
sharpen
the
court's
focus
on
the
evidence
and
not
to
sort
of
un...
to
artificially
prevent
the
court
from
reaching
the
important
issue
in
a
case.
