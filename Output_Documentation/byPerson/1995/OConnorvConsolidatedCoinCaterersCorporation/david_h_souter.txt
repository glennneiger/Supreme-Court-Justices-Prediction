justice
david
h.
souter
is
your
position
as
uncompromising
as
it
sounds
when
you
say
you
need
only
allege
replacement
by
a
younger
person,
or
do
you
mean
that
there
must
be
a
replacement
by
a
person
sufficiently
younger
so
that
it
might
reasonably
be
the
case
that
age
had
been
the
reason?
if
somebody
55
is
replaced
by
somebody
54,
are
you
going
to
say
that's
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
realize.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
daly,
i
want
to
get
clear...
going
back,
i
guess,
to
your
original
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
i
want
to
get
clear
on
what
you
think
happens
in
applying
the
so
called
prima
facie
case
rule,
or
presumption
rule.
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't
take
the
position,
and
i
don't
know
that
anybody's
taking
the
position
that
if
the
employer...
if
the
employee
simply
proves
qualification,
continuing
existence
of
the
job
and,
let's
say,
replacement
by
a
younger
person,
that
that
entitles
the
employee
to
judgment.
the
employee
is
not
entitled
to
anything
at
that
point,
as
i
understand
it,
except,
under
mcdonnell
douglas,
a
reason
from
the
employer,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
if
the
employer
stands
mute
and
says,
i
don't
know
why,
then
you
take
the
position,
and
i
guess
mcdonnell
douglas
does,
that
considering
the
employer's
incapacity
to
give
a
reason,
which
does
not
trench
on
the
forbidden
category,
that
is
enough
to
get
to
the
jury,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
if
the
employer
does
give
a
reason,
as
i
understand
it,
therein...
and
let's
say
in
this
case
an
age
neutral
reason...
all
that
does
is
dissolve
the
presumption,
and
whether
you
get
to
the
jury
or
don't
get
to
the
jury
is
going
to
depend
on
other
things,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
going
to
depend
on
what
else
you
put
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there's
no...
so
we
keep
using
prima
facie
case,
and
so
do
you,
but
you
don't
mean
by
it
that
there
is
a
prima
facie...
before
the
moment
at
which
the
employer
either
gives
a
reason
or
stands
mute,
you
don't
mean
by
that
that
there
is
a
case
that
goes
to
the
jury.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
silence
which
is
evidence--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
employer
doesn't
come
up
with
a
reason.
and
you
say
that
it
goes
to
the
jury
automatically
if
the
employer
does
not
come
up
with
a
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
if,
in
fact,
we
conclude
that
on
the
point
on
which
we
took
cert
that
the
fourth
circuit
was
wrong,
that
we
will
nonetheless
have
to
affirm
the
case
because
there
was
another
element
of
mcdonnell
douglas
which
was
found
by
the
court,
by
the
fourth
circuit,
not
to
have
been
met?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm...
with
respect,
i'm
just
asking
you
about
the
mcdonnell
douglas
presumption.
are
you
saying
that
if
we
conclude
the
fourth
circuit
was
wrong
in
its
assumption
that
the
replacement
must
have
been
from
outside
the
protected
class,
that
we
will
nonetheless,
on
the
record
before
us,
have
to
affirm
the
judgment
anyway
because
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
another
mcdonnell
douglas
prong
had
not
been
met?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
we
just
took
a
mcdonnell
douglas
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
we
just
took
this
case
for
the
mcdonnell
douglas--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
tell
me
just
so
that
i
don't
misunderstand
it,
what
is
the
other
prong
which
the
fourth
circuit
held
had
not
been
satisfied?
it
was
the
prong
of
competence
to
do
the
job?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mcdonnell
douglas
simply
requires...
as
i
recall,
simply
requires
a
demonstration
that
the
complaining
employee
was
qualified
to
do
the
job.
did
the
fourth
circuit
conclude
that
he
had
not
shown
that
he
was
qualified?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
not
my
question,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
mcdonnell
douglas
criterion
is.
did
the
fourth
circuit
conclude
that
he
had
not
shown
that
he
was
qualified
to
do
the
job?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes
or...
i
think
it's
a
yes
or
no
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
the--
--so
it's
an
open
question.
we
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
affirm,
we'd
have
to
send
it
back.
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--that
is--
--please.
at
pages
12
and
13
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
the
fourth
circuit
is
discussing
this
point,
and
before
the
beginning
of
the
paragraph
on
page,
appendix
13,
the
court
says...
concludes,
examining
the
third
prong,
before
it
gets
to
its
fourth
prong
discussion,
because
under
arts
reorganization
the
geographic
territories
were
even
larger,
and
o'connor's
territory
was
already
reduced,
o'connor's
evidence
tending
to
establish
that
he
was
working
up
to
expectations
does
not
create
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
are
you
saying
that
that
is
a
finding
that
the
third
prong
has
not
been
established
by
o'connor?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
it
fair
to
say
that...
benjamin
franklin
was
right.
we
can
always
find
a
reason
for
what
we
want
to
do,
and
employers
do
that,
too.
and
the
only
thing
that
mcdonnell
douglas
is
addressing
is,
in
fact,
an
admittedly
very
strange
situation
in
which
the
employer
can't
come
up
with
any
reason
at
all.
and
in
that
case,
when
qualification
has
been
proven,
when
the
existence
of
a
job
has
been
proven,
when
we
will
assume
some
age
differential
has
been
proven,
all
mcdonnell
douglas
is
saying
is,
there's
something
very
strange
here
if
he
can't
come
up
with
any
reason
at
all,
and
therefore
the
reason
probably
is
the
age...
in
this
case,
the
age
differential.
that's
all
mcdonnell
douglas
is
saying,
isn't
it,
and
is
that
so
contrary
to
the
laws
of
nature?
justice
david
h.
souter
good.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
that
your
position
simply
because
a
line
has
got
to
be
drawn,
the
statute
draws
it
somewhere,
and
that's
it?
or
is
it
your
position
for
mcdonnell...
i
shouldn't
say
the
statute
draws
it
there.
the
mcdonnell
douglas
presumption
ought
to
draw
it
there.
or
is
that
your
position
because
substantively
there
cannot
be
liability
under
the
adea
unless
the
replacement
is
outside
the
protected
class?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
you're
simply,
a
line--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
simply
basing
your
position
on
the
fact
that
a
line
has
got
to
be
drawn
somewhere
or
your
presumption
starts
getting
useless.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
ultimately
it's
because
you
should
draw
a
line
somewhere
or
your
presumption
basically
ceases
to
be
useful.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
if
you
didn't
draw
some
such
line
as
this--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
presumption
would
produce
results
which
were
irrational.
justice
david
h.
souter
that,
too,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
not
because
congress
intended
that
there
would
be
no
liability
under
the
age
act
in
the
event
that
the
person
hired
was,
himself,
within
the
protected
class.
that's
not
your
reading.
