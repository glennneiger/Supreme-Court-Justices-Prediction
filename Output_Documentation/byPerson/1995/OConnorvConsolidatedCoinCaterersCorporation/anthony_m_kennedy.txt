justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
if
you
prevail
in
your
argument
on
the
prima
facie
case
and
you
obtain
a
reversal,
then
you're
hoping
to
be
able
to
go
to
trial,
and
then
you
can
talk
about
all
this
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
but
then
maybe
we
should
get
back
to
the
prima
facie
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--have
we
held
that
the
presumption
applies,
that
the
mcdonnell
douglas
presumption,
the
prima
facie
case
rule,
applies
in
an
adea
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
the
respondent...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
how
you
interpret
his
brief...
doesn't
take
issue
with
that.
both
parties
seem
to
assume
that
the
mcdonnell
douglas
prima
facie
case
rule
should
apply
in
an
adea
case,
and
we've
never
held
that,
have
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
reason
i
ask
is
because
justice
scalia's
question
indicates
that
perhaps
we
should
think
about
it.
basically,
what
you're
saying
is
that
we're
making
an
empirical
judgment
that
most
people
that
are
40
years
of
age
or
older
and
that
are
terminated
are
terminated
by
reason
of
their
age.
i
find
that
rather
difficult.
i
recognize
that
there
are
some
other
tests,
some
other
criteria
before
the
prima
facie
case
applies.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you're
saying
there's
no
issue
does
that
mean
that
the
third
prong,
that
he's
failed
to
establish
the
third
prong?
it
says
it
does
not
create
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
that's
not
the
way
we
usually
talk
when
we're
asking
whether
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out.
