justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
there
be,
because
this
applies
not
just
to
dismissals,
it's
also
refusals
to
hire,
isn't
it,
and
it's
also
when
you
reduce
force
and
you
have
two
people
doing
the
job
of
four,
and
so
why...
i
mean,
and
it's
the
same
problem
whether
or
not
you
are
interested
in
the
question
before
this
court,
because
somebody
40
years
old
is
not
hired,
and
they
hire
somebody
39-1/2
years
old.
the
employer...
you
say
to
your
employer,
what's
the
reason?
he
says,
i
don't
know.
i
had
to
hire
somebody.
i
guess
i
like
that
person's
looks
a
little
better.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
then...
and
then
under
those
circumstances
you're
saying
mcdonnell
douglas
requires
this
to
go
to
the
jury,
so
for...
i
mean,
there's
no
other
evidence
in
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
it
very
odd
that
people
sometimes
hire
people
where
there
are
very
equally
qualified,
and
one
is
a
few
months
older
than
the
other,
and
you
don't
really
know
why,
you
just
thought
this
was
a
little
better,
this
person,
you're
not
sure?
is
that
odd,
really?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
all
you
have
to
say,
and
that's
the
end
to
all
these
presumptions.
do
you
have
any
authority
in
the
circuits
that
the
explanation,
i
don't
have
a
reason,
is
sufficient
to
overcome
the
prima
facie
case
and
make
it
dissolve
and
go
away?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
i...
you
can
just
say
i'm
wrong.
don't
go
into
it
further
if
i'm
simply
wrong.
just
say
i'm
wrong
if
i'm
wrong.
my
understanding
was
that
the
fourth
circuit
had
two
ways
of
analyzing
it.
they
said
first,
let's
see
if
it's
a
discharge
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then,
let's
see
if
it's
a
reduction
in
force
case.
as
to
the
first,
they
articulate
the
third
prong
as,
was
he
performing
his
job
at
a
level
that
met
his
employer's
legitimate
expectations?
as
to
that,
they
didn't
answer
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
said,
we
just
go
to
the
fourth.
then
they
looked
at
it
as
a
reduction
in
force
case,
and
on
that,
the
third
prong
is
phrased
differently.
it
is
phrased
whether
he
was
performing
at
a
level
substantially
equivalent
to
the
lowest
level
of
those
the
group
retained.
as
to
that
part,
they
said,
he
satisfies
neither
the
third
nor
the
fourth.
so,
if
we
were
considering
it
as
a
reduction
in
force
case,
we'd
have
to
say
there
are
two
grounds,
but
if
we're
considering
it
as
a
firing
case,
which
was
the
first
thing
they
did,
they
never
considered
the
third
ground,
and
therefore
we
can't
say
you
would
have
won
anyway.
we
have
to
reach
the
issue
that
we
granted
cert
on.
and
so
if
i'm
right
so
far,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
that
issue.
[laughter]
am
i
right
so
far?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
fine.
[laughter]
okay,
good.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
then
i
get
a...
now
i
get
a
free
question.
[laughter]
the...
this
would
be
the
question.
we
just
assume
for
a
minute...
this
is
where
i'm
actually
having
some
trouble
on
this.
suppose
i
were
to
assume
against
you
that
this
thing
of
considering
the
39-year-old
but
not
the
40-year-old,
really
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
and
the
reason
that
you...
it's
the
protected
class
versus
the
nonprotected
class,
actually
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
suppose
i
thought
that.
i'd
still
have
to
say
whether
you
make
out
this
prima
facie
case
if
there's
a
substantial
age
difference,
or
you
made
it
out
if
there's
any
age
difference,
and
that's
what
they
were...
both
the
sg
says
substantial,
i
think,
and
a
lot
of
them
say
substantial
in
the
circuits,
anyway,
but
your
opponent
has
said
no,
any
age
difference.
now,
i
would
have
thought
substantial,
until
i
heard
him
argue.
then
he
said,
look,
it
doesn't
matter
that
much
if
there's
only
a
year
difference.
the
employer
will
come
in
and
say,
i
like
this
other
person
better.
besides,
there's
only
a
year's
difference.
isn't
it
obvious
it
wasn't
age?
and
he'll
get
summary
judgment.
that's
what
i
take
his
argument
to
be.
you
might
as
well...
so
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
that
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
should
it
be
substantial,
or
just
any
difference?
and
whereas
i
thought
it
should
be
substantial,
he
said,
hey,
that's
going
to
lead
to
a
lot
of
people
doing
it
all
kinds
of
different
ways.
please,
stay
away
from
that,
just
say,
any
difference,
and
it's
no
big
deal,
because
all
the
employer
has
to
do
is
come
in
and
say,
i
didn't
like
his
looks,
that's
why
i
didn't
hire
him,
okay,
and
there's
no
age
difference
here.
after
all,
it's
only
6
months
in
age.
and
any
sensible
judge
wouldn't
even
send
that
case
to
the
jury.
they'd
just
grant
defendant
verdict,
the
summary
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
