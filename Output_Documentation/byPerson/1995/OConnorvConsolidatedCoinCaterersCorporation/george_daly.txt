mr.
george
daly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
james
g.
o'connor
had
a
successful
career
with
the
consolidated
coin
caterers
corporation
until
the
summer
of
1990,
and
at
age
56
he
was
terminated.
he
was
replaced
by
a
40-year-old
employee.
two
weeks
before
the
termination
decision
was
announced
to
him,
and
arguably
on
the
day
that
it
was
made,
his
boss
came
to
his
office
and
he
said,
o'connor,
you
are
too
damn
old
for
this
kind
of
work.
after
a
little
brief
colloquy
after
that,
he
got
up
and
left.
mr.
o'connor
was
terminated
despite
having
an
exemplary
record,
both
historically
and
recently.
his
most
recent
performance
evalued
was
commendable.
he
had
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
year
received
the
largest
performance
bonus
of
anybody
in
the
company.
he
had
a
better
record
than
his
replacement,
who
had
a
slightly
below
average
performance
evaluation
for
the
preceding
year,
and
who
throughout
their
career
had
ranked
lower
in
the
company
salary
class
classification.
mr.
george
daly
thank
you,
sir,
i--
mr.
george
daly
--well,
i
appreciate
that.
i
state
them
briefly
thus
because
they
are
such
an
important
background
and
they
focus
the
importance
of
the
issue,
which,
as
you
say,
is
whether
this
plaintiff
is
going
to
lose
the
benefit
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
presumption
because
the
person
who
replaced
him
is
40
rather
than
39.
mr.
george
daly
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case,
it
was
not.
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
that
he
did
not
have
a
prima
facie
case
under
mcdonnell
douglas
because
his
replacement
was
not
under
40.
mr.
george
daly
in
the
fourth
circuit
it
takes
nexus,
and
they
held
that
he
did
not
have
nexus
because,
even
though
under
the
record
it's
quite
possible
that
the
boss
came
in
and
said
you're
too
old
for
this
kind
of
work
on
the
very
day
that
the
decision
was
made,
since
he
was
fired
2
weeks
later,
the
circuit
court
said
there's
not
enough
nexus.
i
suppose
that's
their
new
word
for
causation.
and
for
that
reason,
this
very
meritorious
case
is
dependent
precisely
and
only
upon
the
mcdonnell
douglas
paradigm
in
order
to
succeed.
mr.
george
daly
they
said
that
they
were
stray
remarks.
mr.
george
daly
yes,
but
the
record
shows
that
the
person
that
made
the
decision,
ed
williams,
made
the
remark
on
the
decision
day,
arguably,
o'connor
you
are
too
damn
old
for
this
kind
of
work.
that's
smoking
gun
evidence.
that's
clear
evidence
of
intent.
that's
a
dead
body
lying
on
the
floor
with
a
smoking
gun
next
to
it.
mr.
george
daly
that's
correct.
what
we
want
is--
mr.
george
daly
--thank
you,
justice
kennedy.
the
problem
with
the
under-40
replacement
is...
there
are
several
problems
with
it.
the
first
problem
is
that
it
gives
irrational
results.
you
have
a
65-year-old
replaced
by
a
40-year-old,
you
don't
have
a
prima
facie
case.
you
have
a
41-year-old
replaced
by
a
39-year-old,
you
do
have
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
george
daly
we
adopt
both
positions.
the
only
one
we
need
to
prevail
on
to
prevail
in
this
court
is
the
first
one,
that
you
just
need
a
younger
replacement.
mr.
george
daly
i--
mr.
george
daly
--our
position
is
that
all
you
need
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
say
that
the
replacement
was
younger,
and
leave
for
a
later
day
the
case
that's
not
presented,
which
is
the
case
of
whether
there
needs
to
be
any
showing
about
the
characteristics
of
the
replacement
at
all.
mr.
george
daly
yes,
although
that's
not
the
case
presented
here.
mr.
george
daly
it's
a
difficult
line
to
draw,
as
all
lines
are
difficult
to
draw,
but--
mr.
george
daly
--it
really
plays
into
the
alternate
argument
that
you
shouldn't
require
anything
at
all.
this
is
a
characteristic
that
sometimes
is
not
within
the
knowledge
of
the
person
who
is
replaced.
mr.
o'connor
didn't
know,
for
instance,
who
replaced
him
when
he
first
came
into
my
office.
we
only
found
it
out
in
discovery.
but
as
to
your
question
of
the
56-year-old
who
is
replaced
by
the
55-1/2-year-old,
i
understand
that
creates
some
difficulties
at
the
edges.
i
think
it
creates
more
difficulties
not
to
do
it
that
way.
if
you
start
talking
about
substantially
younger,
then
you've
just
made
a
litigation
minefield.
mr.
george
daly
that
is
the
correct
statement,
along
with
st.
mary's.
mr.
george
daly
precisely
yes.
that's
nothing
more
than
what
mcdonnell
douglas
says.
that's
nothing
more
than
what
mandatory
rebuttable
presumptions
do
every
day.
mr.
george
daly
in
the
very
unusual
case
in
which
the
employer
articulates
no
explanation,
which
is
the
very
unusual
case,
that
presumption
would
establish
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
and
if
the
jury
believed,
on
that
evidence
alone,
that
there
had
been
age
discrimination,
then
under
this
court's
precedents
and
the
test
we
announced,
you
could
get
a
judgment,
just
as--
mr.
george
daly
--no,
you
have
not
held
that.
mr.
george
daly
no.
there's
a
dictum
in
the
dissent
in
the
st.
mary's
case
that
assumes
that.
all
of
the
circuits
have
held
it.
all
12
circuits
have
held
that
the
mcdonnell
douglas
prima
facie
case
paradigm
applies
to
age
cases.
all
of
the
parties
agree
with
it.
the
lorillard
v.
pons
case
says
that
these
statutes
are
drawn
from
the
same
fundament,
and
basically
mcdonnell
douglas
is
a
method
of
organizing
the
proof
in
a
discrimination
case.
mr.
george
daly
well,
i
don't
think
you're
making
that
much
of
an
empirical
judgment,
because
as
a
litigation
practicality,
once...
there's
almost
always
a
statement
of,
an
articulation
of
a
reason
by
the
employer.
mr.
george
daly
well--
mr.
george
daly
--in
the
very
odd
case
when
there's
not
only--
mr.
george
daly
--i'm
sure
it
happens,
but
the
function
of
the
presumption
is
to
sort
out
the
generality
of
cases
in
which
we
have
identified
factors
that,
as
a
due
process
matter,
allow
you
to
say
with
some
assurance
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
there's
been
a
prohibited
reason.
mr.
george
daly
to
that
extent,
you
are
correct
that
the
circuits
have
not
absolutely
adopted
the
mcdonnell
douglas
test
as
written,
except
for
the
first
circuit
in
the
loeb
case
and
the
banco
santienda
case
most
recently.
they
say
that
you
don't
consider
the
age
of
the
replacement,
or
the
characteristics
of
the
replacement
at
all.
nine
other
circuits,
and
sometimes
the
sixth
circuit,
have
one
or
another
form
relations
younger,
substantially
younger,
younger
enough
to
create
an
inference
of
discrimination.
my
position,
the
petitioner's
position,
is
that
simply
younger
is
the
best
choice
of
those
various
competing
formulations.
mr.
george
daly
when
someone
56
is
replaced
by
someone
55,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
the
motive
is
age
discrimination.
the
replacement
could
have
been
made
by
a
different
person,
so
to
that
extent
the
age
of
the
replacement
is
a
flawed
proxy.
in
a
large
corporation,
if
a
middle
manager
gets
terminated,
sometimes
you
call
human
relations
and
you
say,
send
me
another
middle
manager,
and
sometimes
there's
a
large
gap
of
time.
mr.
george
daly
yes.
if--
mr.
george
daly
--if
you
have
a
person
who
is
qualified
and
who
sought
the
job,
and
who's
within
the
protected
class,
and
who
didn't
get
the
job,
we
say
that
at
that
point
it
is
fair
to
call
on
the
other
side
for
an
explanation.
mr.
george
daly
the
difference
in
age
was
16
years,
which
survives
under
any--
mr.
george
daly
--that's
correct.
we
prevail
under
that
standard.
out
of
all
the
possible
standards
that
would
allow
us
to
prevail,
we
particularly
argue
in
favor
of
the
younger
standard,
as
opposed
to
the
younger
enough
to
create
an
inference,
or
the
10-year
standard,
which
was
proposed
by
somebody.
but
you
are
quite
correct,
we'd
prevail
on
any
of
the
above
standards,
as
long
as
you
don't
adopt
the
irrational
under-40
standard
which,
of
course,
is
just
a
road
map
to
how
to
avoid
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
george
daly
yes,
exactly,
an
articulation.
mr.
george
daly
right.
mr.
george
daly
right.
it's
going
to--
mr.
george
daly
--on
pretext,
yes.
mr.
george
daly
yes.
mr.
george
daly
no,
not
at
all.
the
employer
has
the
opportunity
to
present--
mr.
george
daly
--exactly.
mr.
george
daly
if
you
meet
the
presumption...
if
you
mail
a
letter,
and
you
put
it
in
the
post
office
box,
and
you
put
the
right
postage
on
it,
and
you
properly
address
it,
and
you
prove
those
facts,
you
get
to
the
jury
on
that
and
the
jury
can
consider
what
the
person
who
is
supposed
to
have
gotten
the
letter
wants
to
say.
mr.
george
daly
right,
and
this
employer
comes
into
court
and
sits
there
with
his
lawyer
and
says
absolutely
nothing,
and
you've
got
a
perfectly
qualified
55-year-old
who
didn't
get
the
job,
was
replaced
by
a
younger
person.
mr.
george
daly
no.
at
that
point
the
employer
has
come
in
and
said
something.
mr.
george
daly
the
presumption
only--
mr.
george
daly
--well,
he's
articulated
a
nondiscriminatory
reason,
i
suppose,
which
is
that
we
can't
tell
what--
mr.
george
daly
--right.
mr.
george
daly
no,
i
don't,
but
in
all
presumptions
there
are
going
to
be
cases
at
the
margins.
mr.
george
daly
i
don't
bring
cases
if
a
person
who
comes
in
and
says,
i'm
40,
i
was
replaced
by
a
39-1/2.
i'd
analyze
their
case
about
what
they've
got.
mr.
george
daly
i
wouldn't
go
to
trial--
