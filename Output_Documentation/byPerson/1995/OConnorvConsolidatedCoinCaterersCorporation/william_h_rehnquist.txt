chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
95-354,
james
o'connor
v.
consolidated
coin
caterers
corporation.
mr.
daly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
daly,
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
was
whether
a
plaintiff
can
allege
a
prima
facie
case
under
the
age
discrimination
act
by
showing
that
he
was
replaced
simply
by
a
younger
person,
or
does
he
have
to
show
that
he
was
replaced
by
someone
outside
the
protected
class.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
some
of
the
facts
that
you're
talking
about
would
be
relevant
perhaps
in
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
but
less
relevant
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
embraces
the
case
that
a
couple
of
my
colleagues
are
talking,
where
someone
55,
56
is
replaced
by
someone
55,
where
it
certainly
isn't
a
rational
presumption,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
saying
that
it
is
the
most
logical
assumption,
if
someone
56
is
replaced
by
someone
55,
that
there's
been
discrimination
because
of
age?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
certainly
don't
agree
with
you
on
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
daly.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wolfson,
you
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
perhaps
the
plaintiff
could
prevail
on
the
basis
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
test.
does
the
mcdonnell
douglas
test,
if
satisfied
the
plaintiff...
do
more
than
allow
the
plaintiff
to
go
to
the
factfinder,
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
it
ever
allow
the
plaintiff
to
do
more
than
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
employer
is
mute,
then
my
understanding
was
it
allowed
you
to
go
to
the
jury,
but
you're
saying
it
entitles
you
to
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
does
the
factfinder
have
to
believe
the
employer's
reason?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
one...
at
one
point
you
grant
summary
judgment
to
the
defendant
because
the
plaintiff
hasn't
made
an
adequate
showing.
another
point,
you
say,
this
can
go
to
the
jury,
it
will
determine
it.
and
a
still
third
point
on
the
spectrum
is
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
prevailed
on
the
basis
of
this
showing
without
submitting
it
to
the
factfinder.
and
i
think
some
of
your
answers
tend
to
blur
those
three
stages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
who
decides
the
question
of
whether
it's
false
or
not,
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
the
judge?
i
mean--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
decides
whether
the
explanation
is
false,
the
jury
or
the
judge?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is...
by
hypothesis
at
that
point
it
has
gone
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
now
wait
a
minute.
you
just
said
that
the
jury
decides
whether
it's
false,
and
now
you're
saying
no,
it
may
not
have
gone
to
the
jury.
well,
what
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
employer's
statement
stands
alone?
why
is
the
factfinder
required
to
believe
that,
even
if
there's
no
evidence
to
discredit--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why
not?
why
shouldn't
the
jury
decide
whether
the
employer's
reason
is
pretextual
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you...
the
jury
is
free
to
disbelieve
any
witness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
spears,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
isn't
that
at
least
a
starting
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
spears.
the
case
is
submitted.
