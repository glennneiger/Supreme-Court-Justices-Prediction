justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
aware
of
any
case
that
had
those
bare
bones
facts
in
it?
didn't
the
employer
always
at
least
say,
we've
always
told
our
people
not
to
discriminate,
they're
forbidden
grounds?
don't
they
always
say
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
about...
we're
arguing
all
about
mcdonnell
douglas
now.
mcdonnell
douglas,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
did
not
require,
as
an
element
of
the
prima
facie
case,
that
you
prove
that
the
replacement
was
not
a
member
of
the
protected
class.
there's
nothing
to
that
effect
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
a
refusal
to
hire
case,
of
course,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
prove
qualification,
the
position
remained
open,
and
they
interviewed
people
afterwards
and
they
ultimately
hired
someone.
they
didn't
say
it
has
to
ultimately
be,
hired
someone
outside
the
protected
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
one
requirement
of
mcdonnell
douglas
that
hasn't
been
emphasized
very
much
in
the
argument
so
far
is
one
of
the
elements
of
the
prima
facie
case
is
to
prove
that
the
person
is
qualified
for
the
job,
which
then
you
say,
why
did
you
fire
him?
that
would
generally
raise
the
question,
why
did
you
fire
a
qualified
person,
and
one
possible
answer
is,
well,
he's
a
member
of
a
protected
class,
and
then
the
employer
comes
in
and
says
otherwise,
it's
not
true.
but
it's
important
that
the
plaintiff
must
prove
that
he
or
she
was
qualified
for
the
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
guess
you
don't
deny
that
that
proof
was
met
in
this
case.
