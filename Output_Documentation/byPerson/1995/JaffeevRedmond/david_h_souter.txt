justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
is
it
different
in
kind
from
the
kind
of
evidence
that
would
be
privileged
under
the
clinical...
under
a
privilege
for
clinical
psychologists?
does
the
social
worker
here
learn
something
different
in
sort
of
standard
counseling--
justice
david
h.
souter
--from
what
a
clinical
psychologist
learns
and
hears?
justice
david
h.
souter
because?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that
sounds
very
sensible
just
based
on
the
language
we're
using.
as
a
matter
of
positive
knowledge,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
sounds
like
a
reasonable
answer,
but
is
it
true,
i
guess
is
what
i'm
saying.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well--
--well--
--can
we
say
that
there
simply
are
no
clear,
standard
cases
on
which
we
can
answer
that
question?
in
other
words,
psychiatric
social
workers
do
all
sorts
of
things.
who
knows
what
they're
doing,
is
that
sort
of
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
asked
us
to
recognize
a
line
between
statements
about
fact
and
statements
about
feeling,
and
i
confess
that
i'm
skeptical
that
we
could
do
that.
what
if
somebody
says
to
the
social
worker
or
the
psychologist,
"i
feel
bad
about
killing
somebody.
"
does
that...
is
that
on
one
side
of
the
line
or
the
other?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
though
there's
an
admission
in
it,
that
implicit
admission
in
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
if
he
says,
"i
didn't
do
it"?
justice
david
h.
souter
"i
didn't
kill
anybody".
that's
his
defense.
"i
did
not
kill
anybody".
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's...
no,
i'm
saying
that's
his
legal
position.
"i
did
not
kill
the
decedent
that
i
am
accused
of
killing.
"
go
back
to
our
statement.
"i
feel
bad
about
killing
somebody.
"
is
it
subject
to
the
privilege?
would
it
be
subject
to
a
privilege
or
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
really
can't...
there's
no
analytical
distinction,
then--
justice
david
h.
souter
--between
the
fact
and
the
feeling.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
even
on
your
balancing
theory
i
thought
the
judge
was
supposed
to
draw...
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
the
judge
was
supposed
to
draw
a
line
between
fact
and
feeling,
and
what
he
was
supposed
to
be
balancing--
justice
david
h.
souter
--was
the
appropriateness
of
admitting
the
fact
as
against
other
interests.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
keep
speaking
of
the
function,
and
if
you
speak
in
terms
of
the
function,
then
there's
never
any
question
as
to
whether,
if
a
privilege
for
psychotherapy
is
recognized,
it
would
cover
social
workers,
as
in
this
case.
let's
assume
that
i
agree
that
there
ought
to
be
a
privilege
so
far
as
communications
back
and
forth
between
the
patient
and
a
psychiatrist
are
concerned
and
the
patient
and
a
clinical
psychologist
are
concerned.
is
there
a
difference
between
what
the
clinical
psychologist
does
in
the
kind
of
standard
case
and
what
the
psychiatric
social
worker
does?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
don't
have
the
advanced
degree.
that's
the
only
clearly
standardized
difference.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
suppose--
--the
method...
i'm
sorry.
i
take
it,
in
line
with
justice
souter's
questioning,
that
most
states
license
clinical
social
workers
and
they
pass
some
sort
of
an
examination.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
so
we
can
draw
the
line
simply
by
saying
the
line's
got
to
be
drawn
somewhere,
and
we're
going
to
draw
it
at
the
point
at
which
the
person
receiving
the
communication
is
licensed
by
the
state.
but
in
principle,
apart
from
that
line-drawing
methodology,
there's
no
reason
to
draw
it
there,
is
there?
i
have
had
law
clerks
tell
me
things
in
confidence,
and
i
presume
they
felt
better
after
telling
me.
[laughter]
i
assume
there
was
some
value
to
it,
but
you
would
not
recognize
the
privilege
in
that
case,
but
there's
no
reason
in
principle
why
you
shouldn't,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
i
take
it
even
on
your
scheme
if
smith
is
dead,
and
an
admission
has
been
made
to
a
psychiatric
social
worker
and
to
no
one
else,
and
a
case
cannot
be
proven
without
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
without
that
admission,
you
would
let
the
admission
in,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
my
hypo.
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
let
it
in.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
whatever
the
value
of
being
able
to
assure
the
patient
of
confidentiality
may
be,
on
your
theory
that
value
would
be
absent,
because
the
social
worker,
the
psychiatrist,
the
psychologist
could
not
say,
what
you
tell
me
is
in
confidence.
all
he
could
say
is,
what
you
tell
me
will
be
kept
confidential
unless
they
need
it
badly
enough.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
about
a
case
like
this,
in
which
there
is
a
claim
that
memory
enhancement
may
be
involved?
memory
enhancement
is
a
lot
like
the...
given
the
possibility
that
the
memory
enhancement
in
fact
is
memory
change,
i
would
suppose
that
that
kind
of
evidence
could
be
just
as
crucial
as
the
unique
evidence
of
guilt.
why
shouldn't
the...
why
shouldn't
an
exception
be
recognized
for
cases
in
which
there
is
a
colorable
claim
that
memory
enhancement
went
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
are
grounds
for
some
suspicion.
would
state
law
in
this
case
have
allowed
an
exception
for
this
evidence
to
come
in?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
recognize
something.
i
mean,
your
brother
was
just
saying
that,
i
think,
that
what
we
should
recognize
is
a
presumption
of
confidentiality
subject
to
exception
by
weighing.
if
we
go
no
further
than
to
do
that,
is
it
even
worth
the
trouble?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
bother?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
your
position--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
the
value
of
a...
of
the
kind
of
presumption
that
he
was
arguing
for?
is
that
worth
the
trouble?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
all
we
did,
should
we
do
it
at
all?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
unclear
on
your
answer
a
moment
ago.
are
you
still
arguing
for
a
uniform
federal
rule
on
privilege?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
are
you
arguing...
so
you're
not
arguing
for
a
rule
that
would
vary
from
state
to
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
the
reason
i...
let
me
tell
you
why
i
ask
the
question.
part
of
the
premise
of
your
argument
is,
the
value
of
recognizing
the
privilege
depends
upon
the
value
of
the
confidentiality
in
the
relationship.
now,
we
can't
tell
what
the
value
of
the
confidentiality
in
the
relationship
is
unless
we
go
state-by-state
and
find
out
which
states
have
strong
privileges,
which
states
have
just
weak
privileges.
and
so
i
guess
what
we
would
have
to
do
is
to
say
well,
if
majority
of
the
states
have
really
strong
privileges,
that
would
probably
justify
our
recognition
of
the
strong
privilege,
but
if
a
majority
of
the
states
have
a
weak
privilege,
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
for
us,
at
least
in
those
states,
to
recognize
a
strong
privilege
because
it
would
have
no
effect
on
the
relationship.
the
social
worker
would
have
to
say,
i
can't
guarantee
much.
is
that
what
we
should
do,
is
sort
of
do
a
nose
count
and
find
out
whether
we're
going
to
get
much
for
our
privilege
or
a
little
for
our
privilege?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
on
your
understanding,
if
there
were
45
states
that
recognized
a
social
worker's
privilege
and
5
that
didn't,
you
would
say
we
ought
to
recognize
it,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
a
uniform
federal
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
