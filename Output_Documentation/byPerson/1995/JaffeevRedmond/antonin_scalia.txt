justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
flaxman--
--you
say
an
attorney
isn't
always
interested
in
changing
someone's
recollections
of
an
incident?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
flaxman,
you
said
earlier
that
the
privilege
recognized
by
some
states,
which
amounts
to
a
balancing
of
the
importance
of
the
information
versus
the...
i
guess,
what,
the
confidentiality
of
it,
that
that
isn't
much
different
from
what
would
be
applied
anyway
in
the
absence
of
a
privilege.
justice
antonin
scalia
allow
it
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
still
is
a
privilege
of
sorts,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
different
from
the
rule
which
would
be
applied
otherwise.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
any
of
these
privileges
that
exist
in
other
states,
has
any
of
them
been
adopted
judicially,
as
a
matter
of
common
law?
are
they
all
legislated?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
nature
of
the
alaska
and
the
arizona
privilege
adopted--
justice
antonin
scalia
--absolute?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
absolute
privilege.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
includes
alaska
and
arizona?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
"i
feel
bad,
feeling
about
killing
somebody.
"
fact?
i
mean,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that,
the
need
for
the
evidence?
you...
you
come
here
saying
there
is
no
privilege,
but
you're
going
to
let
the
court
balance
the
need
for
the
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay,
so
you're
not
denying
there
ought
to
be
a
privilege.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
just
arguing
about
what
the
scope
of
it
ought
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i
thought
you
were
arguing
on
the
basis
of
relevance
before.
i
thought
you
were
saying,
the
facts
come
in
because
they're
relevant,
the
feelings
don't
come
in
because
they're
not,
because
they
aren't
relevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
balancing
there
at
all.
there's
a
determination
of
what's
fact
and
what's
feeling.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
now
you
say
there
is
a
balancing,
so
you're
willing
to
acknowledge
that
some
stuff
doesn't
get
in
because
it's
subject
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why...
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
privilege.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
a
privilege,
just
confidential
interests.
you
want
us
just
to
call
it
a
confidential
interest
instead
of
a
privilege,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
if
we
did
recognize
a
doctor's
privilege,
which
we
haven't,
it
would
be
a
lot
less
expensive,
wouldn't
it?
very
few
people
go
to
a
doctor
in
order
to
get
treatment
and
say,
"i
just
killed
somebody",
whereas
a
lot
of
people
go
to
psychiatrists
and
say,
"i
just
killed
somebody;
i
feel
really
bad
about
it.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
don't
you
think
the
cost
of
the
psychiatrist
privilege
would
be
a
lot
higher
than
the
cost
of
the
medical
doctor's
privilege?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
states
have
a
physician's
privilege,
by
the
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
virtually
all
of
them,
and
yet
we
don't
in
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is
it
possible--
--you
mean,
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it's
the
only
source
of
this
evidence
available
in
this
particular
case?
that
wouldn't
be
taken...
i
had
thought
that
some
of
the
state
courts
that
do
balancing
would
consider
that
thing,
that
this
thing
couldn't
be
obtained
from
any
other
source,
it's
crucial
to
the
defense
or
the
plaintiff's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i'd
consider
that
case-by-case,
myself.
if
you
subscribe
to
what
justice
scalia
just
said,
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
is
to
enable
the
attorney
or
the
doctor,
whoever,
to
tell
a
person,
i
suppose,
that
what
you
say
here
is
confidential,
and
if
instead
he
has
to
say,
what
you
say
here
may
be
confidential,
depending
on
how
some
future
court
may
balance
the
need
for
your
testimony,
that's
much
less
disposed
to
get
people
to
confide.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
in
effect
starting
with
a
presumption
of
confidentiality
subject
to
case-by-case
balancing
on
the
issue
of
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
much
weaker
sense
of
privilege,
then,
than
the
sort
of
classic
privileges.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
i
have
a
duty
of
confidentiality.
if
somebody
comes
up
to
me
and
says,
let's
say
my
nephew
comes
up
to
me
and
says,
you
know,
unc,
i
want
to
tell
you
something
in
strictest
confidence,
and
i
say
yes,
you
tell
me
that,
i
promise
you
i
won't
tell
this
to
anybody.
i
mean,
is
that
enough
that
i've
undertaken
a
duty
of
confidentiality
to
justify
the
creation
of
a
privilege?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand
that,
but
i
just
don't
see
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
duty
of
confidentiality.
there
are
duties
of
confidentiality
in
a
lot
of
situations
which
we've
simply,
utterly
ignored.
parent-child,
there's
no
parent-child
privilege,
for
pete's
sake.
that's
certainly
a
very
confidential
relationship.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
function
is
feeling
better,
and
i
don't
denigrate
that,
by
telling
somebody
something,
and
so
the
function
is
being
performed...
talk
about
poor
man's
psychiatrist,
but
the
function
is
being
performed
when
they
tell
me,
but...
and
so
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
reason
in
principle
why
i
shouldn't
be
able
to
claim
the
privilege.
and
your...
i
think
your
answer
is,
well,
we've
got
to
draw
the
line
somewhere,
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
can
the
psychiatrist
tell...
even
the
full-dress
psychiatrist,
if
we
grant
the
sort
of
privilege
that
you
want
us
to
grant?
what
can
he
tell
the
patient?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you
tell
me
will,
what,
probably,
most
likely,
be
held
in
confidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't
say
that.
you
acknowledge...
you
acknowledge
exceptions.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
state
that
has
no
exceptions?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
have
very
broad
exceptions.
if
it's
important
enough,
you
can
get
it
in,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
could
a
psychistrist
possibly
comfort
his
patient
with,
what
kind
of
assurance
could
he
possibly
comfort
his
patient
with
in
that
kind
of
a
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
very
little.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
do
the
same?
i
mean,
i
have
no
doubt
we
have
the
power
to
pronounce
a
common
law
rule,
but
the
variety
of
rules
in
the
states
is
so
diverse.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
know
which
common
law
rule
to
adopt.
why
shouldn't
we
say,
you
know,
it
looks
like
pretty
much
a
policy
call
that
different
states
have
done
different
ways,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
should
pick
one
of
these
infinite
varieties
of
laws
and
impose
them
on
the
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
get
you
anywhere.
you
don't
even
know
what
privilege
means.
i
mean,
as
you've
described
to
us,
in
some
states
it
means
very
little.
it
means
only,
we'll
think
about
whether
it's
important
enough,
and
if
it
is,
you
can't...
if
it
isn't
important
enough,
you
can't
get
it.
it...
i
don't
view
this
as
a
solid
basis
for
saying
yes,
the
common
law
has
developed
in
a
certain
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
why...
let's
assume
that
the
consultation
occurs
in
a
state
that
has
the
very
negligible...
under
state
law,
the
very
negligible
privilege
that
you
said
it's
worth
adopting,
but
it
won't
do
a
whole
lot
of
good,
so
all
that
that
person
can
tell
the
client
is,
you
know,
under
state
law,
you
have
very
little
assurance
of
confidentiality.
why
should
a
federal
court
accord
to
that
social
worker
or
psychiatrist
a
greater
degree
of
confidentiality
than
the
state
itself?
shouldn't
the
maximum
federal
protection
be
where
the
consultation
has
occurred
in
state
x,
we
will
accord
whatever
confidentiality
the
courts
of
state
x
accord?
i
can't
see
any
federal
justification
for
going
further
than
that,
or
any
use,
for
that
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wonderful,
but
can
we
do
that
under
the
federal
rule?
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
rule
has
to
be
uniform,
so
isn't
this
eminently
an
area
that
we
should
leave
to
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
a
question
about
state
law?
i
assume
that
even
in
illinois,
the
illinois
psychiatrist
or
social
worker
could
not
give
assurance
that
even
a
state
law
action
would
not
require...
it
would
depend
upon
where
the
action
came
up.
i
assume
that
an
indiana
court
would
apply
indiana's
rules;
isn't
that
right?
so
that
if
the
lawsuit
were
in
indiana,
the
illinois
social
worker,
by
reason
of
being
an
illinois
social
worker,
wouldn't
have
a
special
privilege
in
indiana.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
not
saying
what
it
should
do,
but
isn't
that
the
way
things
work?
these
are
forum
rules,
so
that
illinois
can
only
assure
that
an
illinois
social
worker
will
not
be
compelled
to
testify
in
an
illinois
forum.
