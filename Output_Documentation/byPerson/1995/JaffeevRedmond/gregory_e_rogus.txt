mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
enacting
rule
501,
congress
declared
that
the
federal
courts
are
to
look
to
reason
and
experience
in
determining
evidentiary
privileges.
the
intent
behind
the
rule
as
evidenced
both
in
the
legislative
history
and
as
acknowledged
by
this
court
in
the
trammel
decision
was
not
to
freeze
the
law
of
privilege
as
it
existed
but
to
allow
the
courts
flexibility
to
develop
rules
of
privilege,
once
again
in
line
with
reason
and
experience.
now,
it
is
true,
as
mr.
flaxman
has
mentioned,
that
decisions
of
this
court
have
counseled
caution
in
terms
of
the
recognition
of
privilege.
however,
this
court
has
also
stated
that
when
a
privilege
promotes
sufficiently
important
interests
to
outweigh
the
need
for
probative
evidence,
recognition
and
implementation
of
a
privilege
is
proper.
now,
in
this
case
the
seventh
circuit
acted
consistent
with
its
authority
under
rule
501
and
consistent
with
this
court's
directive
in
trammel,
and
determined
that
reason
and
experience
justified
a
recognition--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--the
court
did
engage
in
balancing.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
that
is
a
technique
and
approach
that
is
used,
was
mentioned
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
doe
case.
in
actuality,
what's
at
work
here--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--the
need
for
balancing
is
appropriate
particularly
with
respect
to
determining
when
an
exception
to
a
privilege
should
come
into
play.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
well,
i
think
that
has
been
done
in
the
sense
of
the
recognition
of
the
privilege,
for
example,
in
the
crime
fraud
exception.
while
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
recognized,
and
there
are
no
exceptions
that
come
to
mind
immediately,
the
crime
fraud
exception--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--well,
the
privilege,
the
underlying
privilege
should
be
granted.
the
balancing
that
we
refer
to
is
the
balancing
of
the
important
interests
that
are
served
by
recognition
of
the
privilege
against
the
need
for
probative--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--no,
not
a
case-by-case
balancing.
it's
a
balancing
at
the
policy
level
weighing
the
interests,
the
important
interests
against
the
need
for
probative
evidence.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
if
it
were
the
only
evidence
available
on
a
material
element
of
the
cause
of
action,
that
would
certainly
affect
the
balancing.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
well,
in
this
instance,
psychotherapists
do
need
to
tell
their
patients...
patients
do
need
to
know
that
their
communications
are
confidential.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
a
presumption
of
confidentiality,
yes.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
in
this--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--we
did
not
and
we
are
not
asking
for
recognition
of
an
absolute
privilege.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
if--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--i'm
saying
if
anything
the
psychotherapy...
the
psychotherapist-patient
privilege
should
be
recognized
more
readily
than
the
doctor-patient
because
of,
once
again,
the
nature
of
the
privacy
interests
involved,
the
types
of
things
that
people
go
to
see
psychotherapists
for,
the
types
of
things
that
people
discuss
with
psychotherapists
that
touch
upon
very...
not
always,
but
very
frequently
very
highly
private
personal
concerns,
so
if
anything
there's
more
reason
to
recognize
the
psychotherapist--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--i
am
not
saying
that
a
doctor
does
not.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
i
believe
that
it
has
not
been
recognized,
but
that
is
not--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
psychotherapists
should
have
the
privilege.
we
are
looking
at
a
function,
psychotherapy,
which
does
not
always
coincide
with
medical
practice.
there
is
some
overlap,
but
it
does
not
always
coincide.
we
are
zeroing
in
on
the
function
of
psychotherapy,
the
treatment
and
diagnosis
of
mental
and
emotional
conditions
and
disorders.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
my
understanding,
based
upon
what
was
developed
in
the
record,
and
the
research,
and
the
information
provided
by
the
amici,
is
that
the
training,
the
education,
and
the
functioning
of
clinical
social
workers
approaches
if
not
equates
to
what
clinical
psychologists
do
in
terms
of
performing
the
psychotherapeutic
function,
of
doing
psychotherapy.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
well,
there
is...
i
wouldn't
say
that
one
degree
is
more
advanced
than
another.
there
are
a
lot
of
ph
ds,
for
example,
in
the
clinical
social
work
field,
just
as
there
are
ph
d
advanced
degrees
in
psychology.
much
of
the
training,
the
clinical
experience,
as
i
believe
was
developed
in
the
record
with
respect
to
ms.
beyer,
who...
the
clinical
social
worker
who
was
involved
in
this
particular
case,
demonstrates
the
amount
of
experience,
the
quality,
the
type
of
experience
she
had,
much
of
which
overlapped
with
that
which
a
clinical
psychologist--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--it
is
our
understanding
that
of
the
50
states
that
recognize
privileges,
44
of
them
do,
in
fact,
extend
that
privilege
to
clinical
social
workers.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
yes,
they
do.
i
believe
that
that's
set
forth--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--if
that
is
what
my
previous
remarks
sounded
like,
that
is
not
what
i
meant
to
say.
they
should
recognize
privilege.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
but
you
are
not
engaging,
under
the
facts
as
you've
laid
them
out,
in
a
psychotherapeutic.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
this
arises
in
the
setting
of
a
professional
approach
to
psychotherapy
and
the
importance
and
value
that
society
puts
in--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--having
and
maintaining
such
a
profession
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
members
of
society,
and
in
this
particular--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--it
certainly
is,
an
expectation
of
confidentiality,
and
there
is
an
expectation
of
confidentiality
and
the
protection
of
private
communications
when
a
patient
engages
in
a
psychotherapeutic--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--once
again,
we
are
talking
about
a
particular
function
here.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
and
the
difference
would
be
once
again,
not
only
what...
how
the
person
feels
when
they
have
talked
to
you,
brought
to
you
whatever
their...
what's
on
their
mind,
what
they're
feeling,
et
cetera,
but
what
you,
in
turn,
can
tell
them
and
help
them.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
well,
my--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--what
you
will
tell
me
will
be
held
in
confidence.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
there
are
some
exceptions
that
have
been
noted
by
the
courts
based
on--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--no.
i
believe
they
all
have
at
least
one
exception.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
because
the
exception
should
be--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--very
narrowly
and...
there
should
be
very
few
exceptions,
and
they
should
be
very
narrowly
drawn
to
fit
only
certain
categorical
situations.
for--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--for
example,
i
think
one
of
the
instances
that
was
referred
to
during
mr.
flaxman's
argument
was
if
something
should
be
mentioned
in
terms
of
a
definite
threat
of
harm
to
a
specifically
identified
individual,
if
a
person
goes
in,
talks
to
their
therapist
and
says,
i'm
going
to
kill
joe
smith,
and
there
is
no
reason
for
the
clinician
to
doubt
that
that
person
is
in
fact
capable
of
and
will,
and
would
carry
out
that
specific
threat
to
joe
smith.
in
that
instance,
most
of
the
states
i
believe
have
recognized
a
very
narrowly
drawn
privilege,
once
again,
arising
out
of
the
fact
that
that
very
specific
threat
to
that
one
very
specific
individual
is
there.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
under
the...
if
it
were
the
only
evidence--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--then
i--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--there
have
been
cases
that
allow
that
testimony
in
under--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--yes,
in
a
sense.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
based
on--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--several
points
in
response
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
record
does
not
give
any
indication
whatsoever
that
there
was
such
enhancement.
secondly,
as
the
court--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--whether
the
law
of
the
state
of
illinois...
no,
i
believe
it
would
have
been
privileged.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
as
the
court
indicated
in
trammel,
we
certainly,
in
terms
of
formulating
the
federal
rule,
can
look
to
state
law
for
guidance,
but
inasmuch
as
there
was
a
federal
question
involved
in
this
case,
and
under
the
language
of
501,
we
can
look
to
state
law
for
guidance,
but
state
law
as
state
law
would
not
control
the
question.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
at
the
common
law
prior
to
the
early
seventies
there
was
no
vast
body
of
case
law
indicating
one
way
or
the
other
whether
there
was
a
psychotherapist
patient-privilege
or
not.
there
were
courts
that
were
starting
to
entertain
the
notion
of
a
psychotherapist
patient-privilege.
based
on
the
analysis
provided
by
many
of
the
commentators,
it
was
at
about
that
same
time
that
many
of
the
courts
were
getting
involved
in
addressing
that
issue
that
many
of
the
legislatures
simultaneously
also
began
to
take
action
in
terms
of
not
only
looking
at,
for
example,
the
social
work
profession
and
stepping
up
the
amount
of
state
regulation
of
the
profession
itself,
but
also
enacting
provisions
providing
for
privilege.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
the
principles
of
the
common
law
would...
basically
we
would
look
to
the
development
of
the
law
through
cases
and
court
decisions,
that
is
correct,
and
as
of
the
time
501
was
enacted,
once
again,
no,
there
was
not
a--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--off-hand
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
i
do
not
know
specifically
how
many.
it
was
very
few.
very
few.
my
understanding
is,
just
a
handful
of
states
where
that
is
the
case.
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
and
in
that--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
but
the
basic
thrust
of
what
has
been
going
on
in
the
states
is
to
recognize
the
privilege
and,
given
once
again
that--
mr.
gregory
e.
rogus
--thank
you.
