mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
rule
501
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
congress
delegated
to
this
court
the
power
to
recognize
new
evidentiary
privileges
consistent
with
the
principles
of
the
common
law
as
interpreted
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience.
even
before
rule
501,
when
this
court
had
full
common
law
power
to
recognize
privileges,
the
court
was
very
parsimonious
in
the
privileges
that
it
would
recognize.
the
court
recognized
a
common
law
privilege
for
trade
secrets,
a
common
law
privilege
for
informants,
a
common
law
privilege
for
military
secrets.
the
court
rejected
a
news
gatherer's
privilege,
and
an
accountant's
privilege.
following
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
the
court
has
continued
to
be
very
reluctant
to
establish
new
privileges.
the
court
rejected
an
editorialist
privilege,
a
state
legislator's
privilege,
an
accountant's
work
product
privilege,
and
an
academic
peer
review
privilege.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
1973,
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
and
the
court
limited
spousal
privileges.
the
respondents
in
this
case
ask
the
court
to
fashion
a
new,
broad
privilege
that
would
apply
to
any
mental
health
professional
engaged
in
psychotherapy
or
counseling.
the
number
of
persons
engaged
in
these
professions
is
countless,
and
the
number
of
conversations
that
would
be
protected
by
this
new
privilege
are
countless.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
except
the
states
are
each
day
creating
new
counselor
status
positions.
i
think
california,
there's
now
somebody
who,
after
2
years
of
an
associate's
degree,
becomes
a
certified
alcoholic
counselor.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
yes.
they
receive
a
state
license,
and
they're--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--they
can
be
counted,
but
it
would
be...
it
would
be
a
very
large
number.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
absolutely
correct.
in
a
diversity
case,
the
rules
of
evidence
require
the
federal
courts
to
apply
state
law
in
determining
privileges.
this
was
not
a
diversity
case,
this
case.
there
was
a
federal
civil
rights
claim.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
there
was
a
supplemental
claim
brought
under
state
law.
the
principle
that
was
applied
by
the
district
court
that
was
not
questioned
by
the
district
court
is
that
when
there
is
a
state
law
claim
and
a
federal
claim,
that
the
federal...
and
there
is
no
federal
privilege,
the
rule
would
be
to
admit
the...
admit
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
there's
precedent
among...
that
principle
is
recognized,
i
think
uniformly
within
the
circuits.
it's
consistent
with
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
think
it's
been
ruled
on
by
this
court.
it
was
not
challenged
by
the
respondents
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
don't
believe
it's
within
the
questions
that
are
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
think
the
question
here
is
that
the
agreed
question
is
whether
there
should
be
a
federal
privilege
for
this
kind
of
evidence,
and
this
kind
of
evidence
that
we're
focusing
on
is
not
confidential
communications
about
dreams
or
feelings.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
we
don't
know,
on
this
record,
what
kind
of
therapy
was
actually
being
administered.
as
a
general
rule,
i
think
a
legislature
could
make
a
rational
distinction
between
social
workers
and
clinical
psychologists
and
psychiatrists.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
because
they'd
be
different
kinds
of
therapy.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
think
as
a
rational
distinction
a
legislature
could
say
that
a
psychiatrist
and
a
clinical
psychologist
are
going
to
be
more
concerned
with
psychic
reality,
and
a
social
worker
would
be
more
concerned
with
helping
somebody
deal
with
their...
the
problems
that
they're
facing.
we...
in
the
record--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it's--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's...
unlike
the
number
of
people
who
are
licensed,
that's
an
answer...
that's
a
question
that
can't
really
be
ascertained.
it
can
be
debated
by
scholars.
it
can
be
debated
by
interest
groups.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
our
approach.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
brief--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no,
i
think
you're
absolutely
correct,
but
i
think
they're
incorrect
in
reading
the
record
in
this
case.
the
record
in
this
case
doesn't
support
the
claim
that
there
was
psychoanalytic
counseling
going
on
with
the
social
worker
and
respondent
redmond.
the
record
in
this
case
doesn't
reflect
anything
about
the
type
of
therapy--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no,
i
think,
and
i...
perhaps
i'm
misreading
their
brief,
but
i
think
they
make
a
distinction
between
psychoanalysis
and
counseling.
psychoanalysis
is
dealing
with
psychic
truth.
not
with
what
really
happened,
but
with
a
person's
feelings
and
emotions
and
dreams
about
what
happened,
and
about
someone's
childhood.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
our
primary
position
is
that
there
should
not
be
any
privilege.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
when
there
are
confidential
interests,
and
we--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--right.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
our
primary
position,
is
that
the
confidential
interest...
and
we
concede
that
there
are
confidential
interests
in
counseling
and
therapy.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
some
of
the...
they
recognize
some
form
of
privilege.
some
of
those
privileges
amount
to
nothing
more
than
the
balancing
test,
the
district
judge's,
the
trial
judge's
discretion
that
we're
seeking
in
this
case,
and
the
states
have
made
different
exceptions,
and
many
states--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
the
court
below
adopted
a
very
unconventional
definition
of
cumulative.
it
said,
i
think,
that
because
there
were
four
witnesses
who
were
family
members
of
the
deceased,
and
one
police
officer
on
the
other
side
in
the
civil
rights
case,
our
learning
what
the
police
officer
told
the
social
worker,
our
learning
that
the
police
officer
had
had
memory
problems,
would
be
cumulative.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
one
circuit
that
has
recog...
the
second
circuit
has
expressly
adopted
a
balancing
test,
and
describes
the
privilege
that
it
was
adopting
as
nothing
more
than
a
requirement
that
the
district
judge
balance
the
privacy
interest
with
the
opponent's
need
to
know.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
we're
not
seeking
disclosures
about
confidences
about
feelings
or
about
dreams.
we
want
to
know
what
the
client...
what
the
respondent
told
the
social
worker
about
the
incident.
that's...
the
district
judge
said
that's
all
we
can
get.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
it...
the
district
judge
and
the
magistrate
judge
who
supervised
the
deposition
of
the
respondent
didn't
have
any
trouble
dealing
with
that.
it
was
very
clear
that
we
could
ask,
what
did
you
say
about
the
incident,
and
when
we
tried--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--the
notes
of
the
social
worker
only
came
up
after
the
respondent
testified
that
she
could
not
recall
any
of
her
conversations
with
the
social
worker.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
as
a
matter
of
relevancy,
that's
correct,
and
the
district
judge
said
that
we
could
not
get
her
notes
when
he
was
ruling
on
the
relevancy
question.
the
district
judge
said
we
could
get
notes
that
relate
to
conversations
about
the
incident.
it
was
after--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
we
were
given
three
pages
of
heavily
redacted
notes
which
made
clear
the
things
that
the
client
had
said
about
the
incident.
one
of
those
things
is
that
in
november
of
199--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--we
objected
to
that.
the
district
judge
ruled
against
us,
and
we
agree
with
the...
we're
not
challenging
the
district
judge's
ruling
on
that,
and
we've
never
challenged
the
district
judge's
ruling
on
the
redactions.
the
district
judge
held
a
hearing
to
inquire
about
these
i
don't
recall,
these
15
i
don't
recalls
that
came
from
respondent
redmond
when
she
was
asked
about
the
contents
of
conversations
with
the
social
worker.
after
hearing
and
observing
the
character
and
demeanor
of
the
witness,
the
district
judge
said,
these
denials,
these
i
don't
recalls
are
wholly
incredible,
and
the
only
way
to
refresh
her
recollection
is
to
review
all
of
the
notes,
and
the
review
just
for
counsel's
eyes
only.
that
order
about
production
of
the
notes
wasn't
about
a
privilege
or
about
confidentiality,
it
was
to
help
us
cross-examine
her.
it
was
sanctioned
for
this
meeting.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
the
attorney
client--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
there's
a
vast
difference
between
conferring
with
an
attorney
who
is
an
officer
of
the
court,
who
is
interested
in
following
the
law
and
not
helping
somebody
change
their
recollections
of
an
incident,
to
going
into
therapy.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
an
attorney
should
not
be
helping
somebody
change
their
recollections
and
commit
perjury,
and
if
an
attorney
does
that,
then
the
attorney
is
subject
to
sanctions.
if
a
therapist
does
that,
and
helps
somebody
sleep
at
night
after
they
did
a
horrible
thing,
then
the
therapist
has
succeeded.
the
goals
of
therapy
are
quite
different
than
the
goals
of
an
attorney.
an
attorney
is
ultimately
answerable
to
the
court
as
an
officer--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--in
some
states
there
is
a
judicial
override.
there's
a
privilege,
there
are
exceptions
to
the
privilege,
then
there's
a
final
exception
that
provided,
however,
the
trial
court
may
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--or
allow
it
to
be
disclosed.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
it's
a
privilege--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
correct.
it's
like
the
second
circuit's
privilege
that
they're...
just
a
balancing
test.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
alaska
supreme
court
adopted
in
state
v.
allred,
and
the
arizona
supreme
court.
other
than
that,
all
of
the
privileges
have
been
adopted
by
legislative
action.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
alaska
privilege
applied
to
psychologists
and
psychiatrists
did
not
extend
to
social
workers,
and
the
arizona--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no.
well,
i
think
all
of
the
privileges
have
been
limited
with
the
duty
to
disclose
that
someone
is
dangerous,
or
that
there's
a
child
abuse
admission.
there
are
no
absolute
privileges
in
psychotherapy
in
any
state
in
this--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
correct.
there
are
always
instances
where
a
therapist
has
to...
is
required
by
law
to
make
disclosures,
and
so
there
can't
be
this
guarantee
of
absolute
privilege
which
the
american
psychiatric
association
would
urge
and
would
seek.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
think
that's
on
the
side
that
we
don't
get.
i
feel
bad
is--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
right.
i
think
that
invades
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--because
the
district
judge
could
say
that
kind
of
response
is
the
response
that
anybody
would
feel,
even
if
it
was
justifiable,
and
the
probative
value
of
that
statement
that
i
feel
bad--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--the
statement,
i
didn't--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--"i
didn't
kill
anybody"
is
a
statement
about
the
incident.
that
should
be
disclosed.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
would...
well,
i
would
say
that
a
district
judge
would
require
that
that
denial
which...
would
have
to
be
disclosed,
that
it
wouldn't
be
privileged,
but
it
would
be...
that's
a...
that
should
not
be
hidden
from
the
government
in
a
criminal
case,
or
from
a
plaintiff
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
why
we
believe
this
should
be
a
question
for
the
district
judge,
who
can
balance
all
of
these
factors.
in
your
hypothetical--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no,
i--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
trial
judge
could
be
balancing,
whether
it's
fact
or
feeling,
but
also
the
need
for
the
evidence.
if
we
had
a
hypothetical
where
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--with
the
confidentiality
interests
that
are
involved
in
therapy.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no,
i
am
denying
there
should
be...
if
there's
a
privilege,
then--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no,
what
i'm
willing
to
say
is
that
in
an
appropriate
case
the
district
judge
could
say
that
these
feelings
have
so
little
probative
value,
even
if
they
are
relevant
they
should
not
come
in.
if
there
was
a
case
where
there
were
five
police
officers
who
each
say
that
the
officer
who
shot,
shot
because
the
man
had
a
knife
and
was
about
to
plunge
it
into
the
back
of
another
man.
the
therapy
admissions
or
therapy
statements
of
that
fifth
police
officer
who
did
the
shooting
would
have
so
little
probative
value
that
the
confidentiality
should
not
be
invaded.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
we
are
saying
that
there
should
not
be
a
privilege,
that
the
district
judge
should
determine...
should
consider
relevancy,
should
consider
the
confidential
interests,
should
consider
the
impact
of
disclosure
on
the
person
who's
in
therapy--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--because
there
are
confidential
interests
involved
in
therapy.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
not
privilege,
just--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--if
there
is
a
privilege,
then
the
burden
shifts
of
who
has
to
pierce
the
privilege.
in
this
case,
what
happened
is
that
the
respondent
came
forward
and
said,
i
don't
have
to
demonstrate
that
it
was...
we
were
having
psychotherapy.
i
don't
have
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
promise
of
confidentiality.
i
don't
have
to
demonstrate
that
disclosure
would
interfere
with
the
counseling
relationship.
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
say,
i
saw
a
social
worker
and
discussed
things
with
her.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--the
lower
federal
courts,
and
this
court
has
never
reached
the
question,
have--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--have--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--there
is
no
reason
for
a
physician-patient
privilege,
and
that
privilege
is
not
recognized
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
the
distinction...
there
are
many
distinctions
that
can
be
made,
but
the
fundamental
difference
that...
the
fundamental
reason
why
there's
no
need
to
make
that
distinction
is
because
there
is
no
privilege
for
when
you
go
to
a
doctor
and
say
i've
a
broken
foot.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--there's
no
reason
for
drawing
the
line.
if
the
respondent
had
gone
to
a
physician
and
in
the
course
of
getting
treatment
for
a
broken
finger
said,
i
can't
remember
pulling
the
trigger,
that
statement
should
be
admissible
in
the
federal--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--if
the
court
is
willing
to
recognize
a
privilege
for
physician-patient
discussions,
then
the
court
should
recognize
a
psychotherapist
privilege.
the
court
has
never
recognized
the
doctor-patient
privilege,
and
the
court
should
not
recognize
the
psychotherapist-client
privilege.
the...
in
united
states...
in
upjohn
v.
united
states,
the
chief
justice,
then
justice,
wrote
that
the
court
doesn't
lay
down
broad
rules
but
decides
only
the
cases
before
it.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--oh,
it
would
be,
especially
in
a
case
like
this,
where
we've
had
the
disclosures
made
in
november
of
1991,
which
is
5
or
6
months
after
the
incident,
that
respondent
redmond
was
unable
to
recall
pulling
the
trigger.
that
kind
of
information,
which
is
relevant
to
her
believability
and
her
ability
to
come
into
court
and
recall
and
recount
what
happened,
is
the
kind
of
information
that
would
be
shielded
from
us
by
the
broad
privilege
that's
sought
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
virtually
all
states.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
court
has
never
passed
on
it,
and--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--the
circuits
have
uniformly
rejected
a
physician
privilege.
the
circuits
have
generally
recognized
a
clergyperson
privilege,
and
this
court
has
in
dicta
suggested
that
there
should
be
such
a
privilege,
and
that
privilege
is
quite
different
than
the
privilege
with
the
therapist.
if
somebody
goes
to
a
clergyperson
and
talks
about
having
done
a
horrible
thing,
the
clergyperson
probably
will
not
engage
in
50
or
75
therapy
sessions
to
help
the
memory.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
question
then
is
whether
the
sessions
were
clerical
in
nature
or
counseling
in
nature.
my
understanding
of
clerical--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that
would
be
a
difficult
question
for
the
district
judge
to
balance.
[laughter]
if
the
clergyperson
was
doing
therapy
and
was
helping
somebody
recall
memories,
or
get
a
sharper
recollection
of
what
happened,
then
it
would
not
be
what
the
organized
religion
probably
would
recognize
as
clerical...
clerical-penitent
counseling,
and
i
think
that
it's
more
likely
that
a
clerical
person
who's
confronted
with
someone
who's
confessing
to
a
horrible
thing
would
encourage
that
person
to
go
turn
him
or
herself
in,
rather
than
helping
them
process
it
in
their
mind
so
they
remember
it
differently.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
thank
you.
i
have
always
been
tantalized
by
the
idea
that
if
you
tell
someone,
you
tell
this
to
me
i'll
keep
it
a
secret,
that
that
could
be
a
privilege,
that
the
court
should
enforce
that
kind
of
promise,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
used
to
be
the
law.
it
used
to
be
called
the
gentleman's
privilege.
i
think
in
about
the
18th
century
to
17th
century,
courts
stopped
enforcing
that
privilege.
in
branzburg
v.
hayes,
this
court
explicitly
recognized
that
that
used
to
be
the
law
and
it
is
no
longer
the
law.
the
question
of
whether
the
confidential
communication
should
be
recognized
by...
protected
by
a
privilege
or
protected
by
case-by-case
balancing
i
think
should
be
answered
in
favor
of
case-by-case
balancing.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
what
i
believe
the
court
should
do.
the
question
about--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
correct,
but
illinois
can't
even
make
that
assurance,
because
the
common
law
trend
of
courts
has
not
been
to
create
privileges,
it's
been
to
create
exceptions
to
broad
statutory
privileges.
we've
seen
that
in
illinois,
where
there
aren't
exceptions,
or
evidence
that
might
be
relevant
in
a
criminal
case,
where
courts
have
created
an
exception.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
agree
that
we
don't
know,
and
we
wouldn't
know
unless
we
litigated
it
in
the
illinois
courts.
there
was
just
a
recent
amendment
to
the
illinois
statute
which
says
that
the
social
worker
could
reveal
confidential
communications
to
her
employer,
and
if
this
was
in
state
court
we
would
argue
that
this
exception
and
all
the
other
exceptions
require
the
courts,
when
the
evidence
is
crucial,
as
we
would
argue
it
is
crucial
in
this
case,
should
fashion
yet
another
exception,
and
courts
in
other
states--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--i
think
it's
the
conversation
where
the
case
is
being
tried,
rather
than
where
it
occurred.
but
these
questions
have
not
arisen--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--we
don't
face
that
problem
because
the
district
judges
uniformly
say
there's
no
privilege.
if
it's
relevant--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that
hasn't
happened,
and
i
don't
think
it...
it's
just
routinely
accepted.
