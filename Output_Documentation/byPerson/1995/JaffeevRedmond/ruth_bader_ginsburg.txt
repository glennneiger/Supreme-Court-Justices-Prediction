justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
mr.
flaxman,
they
would
be
counted
in
a
diversity
case,
is
that
not
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
one
state
claim?
in
addition,
there
was
a
wrongful
death
claim
under
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
precedent
that
holds
that
the
state--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
flaxman,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
about
this,
but
i
thought
that
part
of
what
you
were
asking
did
involve
mental
impressions
to
the
extent
that
you
were
asking
for
the
notes
of
the
social
worker.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
now
conceding
that
mental
impressions
of
the
social
worker,
mental
impressions
reflected
in
her
notes,
are
things
to
which
you
do
not
have
access?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
conversations,
the
notes,
mix
in,
as
lawyer's
notes
do,
the
social
worker's
own
mental
impressions
with
things
that
the
patient
or
client
said
about
what
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i...
please
just
straighten
me
out
on
what
your
position
is.
do
you
say...
i
thought
you
were
objecting
to
the
redactions.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
saying,
we
want
her
notes,
without
the
editing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
clergyperson
is
also
a
licensed
social
worker?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
answer
is
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rogus,
mr.
flaxman
said
there
were
two
states
that
had
this
privilege
by
virtue
of
court
decisions.
you've
just
explained
that
the
development
was,
courts
were
active,
legislatures
were
responding
with
kind
of
a
dialogue.
do
you
know
how
many...
in
how
many
states
the
privilege
notion
began
in
the
courts,
that
there
was
first
a
court
declaration
and
then
there
was
legislative
codification?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
how
could
you
justify
a
psychologist-social
worker
privilege
without
recognizing
a
medical
doctor
privilege?
