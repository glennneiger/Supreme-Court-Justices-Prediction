mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
rule
501
provides
that
the
privilege
of
a
witness
shall
be
governed
by
the
principles...
not
the
specific
privileges,
but
the
principles
of
the
common
law
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience.
in
our
view,
the
most
significant
feature
to
look
to
in
determining
what
reason
and
experience
tells
us
here
is
the
fact
that
all
50
states
have
recognized
the
privilege
in
one
form
or--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i...
actually,
we...
it's
not
our
position
that
that's
what
the
court
ought
to
do.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
our--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
it
would
have
some
value
in,
some
incremental
value
in
increasing
the
confidence
of
patients
that
their
communications
would
be
confidential,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
the
kind
of
value
that
the
states
generally
have
recognized
when
they've
adopted--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i
think
that
that
would
be
something
useful
to
do.
it's
not
our
position
that
that's
what
the
courts
ought
to
do.
i
think
under
rule
501,
the
federal
courts
ought
to
take
a
cautious
view
towards
the
recognition
of
privileges.
it
ought
to
be
sure
to
recognize
the
general
policy
of
the
federal
rules
in
favor
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
but
where
a
privilege
is
justified,
and
especially
where
the
50
states
have
so...
have
at
least
uniformly
recognized
the
important
interests
that
are
at
stake
in
a
case
like
this,
i
think
the
federal
courts
should
do
likewise.
the
fact
that
all
50
states
have
recognized
it
i
think
shows
that
they
recognize
the
importance
of
psychotherapy
in
the
relief
of
mental
and
psychological
distress
for
people.
i
think
they've
recognized
the
need
for
confidentiality,
the
very
strong
need
for
confidentiality.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
there
has
been...
in
our
view
the
case
for
medical
doctor
privilege
has
not
yet
been
compellingly
enough
made,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
first,
there
are
fewer
states
that
recognize
it.
second,
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
states
recognize
it,
they
generally...
it
generally
has
even
more
exceptions,
and
there's
even...
there's
less
of
it
than
with
respect
to
a
psychotherapist-patient
privilege.
as
the
advisory
committee
on
the
proposed
rules
in
1973,
or
around
there,
recognized,
if
you
look
at
their
commentary
on
the
psychotherapist-patient
privilege,
which
was
in
those
proposed
rules,
and
the
doctor-patient
privilege
was
not,
they
noted
that
confidential
communications
are
even
more
important
for
the
successful
practice
of
psychotherapy
than
for
the
successful
practice
of
medicine.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
on
rule...
proposed
rule
504,
they
do
specifically
go
into
that
question,
and
they
cite
a
previous
paper
that
was
issued
by
the
group
for
the
advancement
of
psychology...
i
don't
recall
the
exact
name...
that
explored
the
subject
more
fully.
there's
also
been
a
number
of
other
things
that
are
cited
throughout
the
amicus
briefs
about
it.
but
the
general
point,
and
the
general
reason
why
the
states
have
seen
fit
to
recognize
one
to
a
greater
extent
than
the
other
is
that,
although
confidentiality
is
no
doubt
important
for
the
practice
of
medicine,
it's
important
for
the
practice
of
many
things.
it's
probably
important
for
accountants.
it's
important...
it's
generally
an
important
value,
but
the
extraordinary
level
of
confidentiality
that
a
privilege
involves,
that
step
should
only
be
taken
where
it's
clearly
justified.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would
certainly
be
a
possible
rule
to
set
the
federal
ceiling
at
the
state
floor.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that...
i've
two
answers.
i
think...
first
of
all,
i
think
congress
has
made
it
quite
clear
and
the
court
has
said
in
its
opinions
that
this
is
something
that
the
courts
have
to
grapple
with
one
way
or
the
other.
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other...
a
decision
not
to
recognize
a
privilege
in
a
state
that
has
a
very
strong
privilege,
for
example,
is
going
to
do
some
damage
to
that
state's
policies,
and
what
that
state
has
recognized
as
necessary
for
the
advancement
of...
or
for--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
wanted
to
get
to
the
second
point,
which
was
that
in
our
brief
we
suggest
that
the
key
question
is
whether
a
confidential
relationship
is
formed,
and
that
question,
since
states
are
the
primary
level
of
government
that
governs
the
relationships
of
psychotherapists
and
patients,
as
with
most
other
professions,
the
question
of
whether
a
confidential
relationship,
a
highly
confidential,
an
extraordinarily
confidential
relationship
is
formed,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
look
to
state
law
for
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
you'd
look
to
the
question
of
whether
the
privilege
extends
to
this
kind
of
a
relationship.
as
far
as
the
specific
narrow
exceptions
to
the
state--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--under
the
rubric
of,
if
there's...
the
federal
privilege...
a
necessity
for
the
application
of
any
privilege
is
that
a
confidential
relationship
is
formed.
in
attorney-client
privilege,
if
you're
not
a
member
of
the
bar
in
a
given
state...
the
state
gets
to
determine
who's
a
member
of
the
bar.
if
you're
not
a
member
of
the
bar,
there's
no
question
that
you
don't
have
a
privilege
in
federal
court,
and
similarly
with
the
marital
privilege
and
other
kinds
of
privilege.
in
the
same
way,
it's
up
to
the
state
to
determine
whether
a
confidential
relationship
has
been
formed,
and
that's
a
prerequisite
for
the
application
of
the
federal
privilege.
once
you
have
that,
i
think
the
exceptions
in
the
states
follow
enough
of
a
pattern
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
the
seventh
circuit
so
held,
in
fact.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would...
no
more--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
not
quite.
what
the
federal
court
should
do
is
look
to
see
whether
the
state
recognizes,
for
instance,
a
relationship
between
a
psychiatric
social
worker
and
a
client
as
being
one
that's
entitled
to
a
very
high
confidentiality
protection
and
accords
it
a
privilege.
if
in
that
state
the
state
has
said,
social
workers
in
this
state...
you
can
go
to
see
a
social
worker,
but
we're
not
going
to
accord
it
any
privilege
at
all,
it's
just
not
that
confidential
a
relationship,
you
don't
have
a
reasonable
expectation
that
a
confid...
it
would
be
like
going
to
see
somebody
about
a
legal
problem
who's
not
a
lawyer.
you
can
do
it,
i
suppose,
but
you
can't...
it's
not
going
to
be
privileged.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no.
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
federal
rule
should
be
that
where
the
state
recognizes
a
confidential
relationship,
recognizes
a
privilege
with
respect
to
a
given
category
of
provider,
that
in
those
cases
i
think
there's
enough
uniformity
in
the
states
to
say
that
a
federal
privilege
is
also
warranted.
