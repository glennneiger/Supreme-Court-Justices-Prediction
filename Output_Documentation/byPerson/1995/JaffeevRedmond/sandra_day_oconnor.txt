sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
flaxman--
--the
brief
of
the
american
psychiatric
association
i
take
it,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
supports
the
respondent
here,
and
they
don't
ask
that
we
draw
the
line
that
you're
suggesting
in
this
colloquy
with
justice
souter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
flaxman,
i
take
it
you
would
not
extend
in
a
federal
case
a
privilege
to
a
psychiatrist.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
regardless
of
what
differences
there
might
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
therapy
or
the
nature
of
the
questions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
all
50
states
recognize
some
form
of
privilege
in
this
area.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
court
below
didn't
adopt
a
clear
rule
of,
there
is
a
privilege
and
that's
that.
it
went
on
to
balance
the
need
for
the
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
area
of
privileged
communications,
do
the
federal
courts
typically
engage
in
a
balancing
in
determining
whether
to
apply
the
privilege
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rogus,
did
the
court
also
balance
the
need
for
the
evidence
with
its
notion
of
the
privilege?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
way
that
federal
courts
normally
approach
the
exercise
of
a
privilege?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
defend
that
as
an
appropriate
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
that
be
the
approach
in
the
case
of
an
attorney-client
privilege,
for
example?
you
balance
the
need?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
the
doctor
doesn't
receive
communications
of
a
very
private
nature
from
a
patient?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
there
is
no
doctor-patient
privilege
recognized
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
that
is
the
general
rule
in
the
courts,
in
the
circuits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
rely,
apparently,
in
giving
your
responses,
on
what
state
law
allows
or
doesn't
allow?
you're
going
to
have
us
decide
it
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
would
be
needed
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
well,
what
does
501
tell
us?
it
tells
us
that
the
privilege
of
a
witness
shall
be
governed
by
the
principles
of
the
common
law
as
they
may
be
interpreted
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states
in
the
light
of
reason
and
experience.
now,
what
do
you
think
the
common
law
provides?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
we
look
to
for
the...
determining
what
the
principles
of
the
common
law
are
here?
