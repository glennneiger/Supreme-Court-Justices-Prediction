chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
95-266,
carrie
jaffee
v.
marylu
redmond.
mr.
flaxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
were
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
adopted,
mr.
flaxman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
really
not
much
of
a
privilege,
is
it,
because
if
everything
is
going
to
be
balanced
at
the
time
the
evidence
is
sought
to
be
admitted...
the
time
the
privilege
is
supposed
to
work
is
when
the
person
either
feels
free
or
does
not
feel
free
to
confide
to
the
professional
therapist.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
may
be
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw.
you
say
you
don't
want
the
person's
mental
reflections
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
it's
not
always
easy
to
separate
those
from
an
account
of
what
happened.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
really
isn't
much
of
a
privilege
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it...
has
this
court
affirmatively
disavowed
a
medical
doctor's
privilege,
or
has
it
just
never
passed
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
flaxman.
mr.
rogus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
case-by-case
balancing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rogus.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
flaxman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
flaxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
