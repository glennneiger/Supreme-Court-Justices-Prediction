stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
wouldn't
have
to
say
that,
why,
in
fact,
are
you
saying
that
there
should
not
be
a
privilege?
i'm
not
interested
in
the
semantics.
i'm
interested
in
this.
if
a
woman
goes
to
a
doctor
and
has
a
physical
problem,
there
is
a
privilege
for
confidential
communications
between
the
patient
and
her
doctor
made
for
the
purposes
of
diagnosis
or
treatment
if
the
doctor
is
licensed
by
the
state
to
perform
that
diagnosis
or
treatment.
why
should
there
not
be
precisely
the
same
privilege
where
the
doctor
is
engaged
in
diagnosis
or
treatment
of
a
mental
or
emotional
condition?
why
should
there
be
a
distinction--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--between
a
doctor
who
diagnoses
a...
or
treats
a
mental
or
emotional
condition
and
a
doctor
who
treats
a
physical
condition,
provided
that
the
state
licenses
the
individual
to
engage
in
that
diagnostic
or
treatment
profession?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
what
the
lower--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
saying
what
reason
is
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
logic
or
policy
that
would
make
that
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
look,
i'm
asking
why...
if
a
person
goes
to
a
doctor
and
the
person
has
cancer,
or
the
person
has
a
skin
disease,
or
the
person
has
an
itch,
there
is
a
privilege
for
statements
made
for
purposes
of
diagnosis
or
treatment.
why
is
it
any
different
where,
instead
of
seeing
the
doctor
for
purposes
of
diagnosis
or
treatment
of
your
itch,
or
cancer,
or
worse,
you
see
that
doctor
or
psychologist
or
social
worker
licensed
to
engage
in
psychotherapy
because
you
have
a
very
serious,
or
less
serious,
mental
or
emotional
problem?
why
in
reason
or
logic
or
policy
should
one
try
to
make
such
a
distinction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
try
once
more.
i'm
not
saying
what
there
is.
i'm
asking
what
there
should
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
i'm
asking
is...
it's
only
me
who's
interested,
perhaps,
but
i
am
interested.
i'm
interested
in,
is
there
any
reason
in
logic,
in
policy,
is
there
any
reason,
other
than
what
ten
courts
have
held?
i'm
not
interested,
for
this
question,
what
courts
have
held
in
the
past.
i'm
interested
in
whether
there
is
a
reason
in
logic
or
policy
for
drawing
the
line
that
i
just
referred
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
not
being
clear?
i'm
saying,
what
is
the
difference
whether
you
go
to
a
physician
to
diagnose
your
cancer,
skin
disease
or
whatever,
or
if
you
go
to
a
licensed
psychologist
or
psychotherapist
or
psychiatrist
for
diagnosis
or
treatment
of
a
mental
or
emotional
condition?
that's
why
i...
that's
the
line
i'm
talking
about.
what's
the
reason
for
drawing
that
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
do--
--well,
how
does
it
stack
up
with
the
doctor?
that's
what
i'm...
i'm
thinking
now
about
the
other
side.
they're
saying,
well,
it
should
be
the
same
as
the
doctor
who
is
diagnosing
you
for
cancer
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
i'm
confused,
and
don't
really
understand
it
too
well,
is
the
status
of
the
doctor
and
client.
suppose
i
have
a
physical
injury
in
a
court.
are
you
asking
for
a
psychiatric
privilege
where
the
doctor
with
the
physical
injury
wouldn't
have
one?
are
you
saying
treat
both
alike?
how...
what
is
the
relationship?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
that's
what
i
mean.
are
we
supposed
to
say
that
just
a
psychiatrist
and
psychoanalyst
have
it,
that
doctors
in
general,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
just
exactly...
what
can
i
read
to
find
out
about
this?
i
mean,
i'm
used
to,
as
many
of
us,
having
diversity
cases,
where,
of
course,
there
is
the
privilege
you're
arguing
for
and
also
a
medical
doctor
privilege.
that's
the
normal
case
we
find
it
in.
i've
never
had
a
case,
i
don't
think,
where
it
came
out
of
the
federal
system
and
a
medical
doctor,
but
mr.
flaxman
seems
to
agree...
i
agree
with
him.
i
don't
know
how
you
distinguish
between
a
patient
who
comes
in
with
a
gunshot
wound,
and
the
doctor's
got
to
find
out
what
happened,
and
a
psychiatric
social
worker
who
says,
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
what
your
problem
was
in
this
case,
or
some
other.
how
can
you
do
the
one
without
the
other,
and
what
were
the
objections
to
the
doctor
privilege?
why
wasn't
a
rule
written
on
that?
where
do
i...
what
do
i
read
to
find
out
about
this?
it
didn't
seem
to
me
very
fully
developed
in
the
briefs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
has
it
never
arisen,
where
someone
in...
you've
practiced
a
lot
in
1983
cases.
has
no
one
ever
tried
to
subpoena
medical
records
from
a
hospital
or
a
doctor's
private...
you
know,
medical
doctor's
private
records?
why
have
we
never
had
to
face
the
problem
of
the
gunshot
wound
or...
the
medical
doctor,
who's
dealing
with
physical
problems?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
wouldn't
you
think
some
doctor
somewhere
or
a
hospital
somewhere
would
have
faced
a
subpoena
for
some
confidential
patient
records
and
would
have
asked
us?
