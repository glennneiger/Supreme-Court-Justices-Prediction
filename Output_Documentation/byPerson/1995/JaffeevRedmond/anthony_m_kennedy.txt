justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
countless
if
they're
licensed
and
we
confine
the
privilege
to
those
who
are
licensed.
i
assume
you
could
go
to
every
state
and
count
how
many
licenses
there
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
are
they
licensed,
or
they
have
some
state
certification,
or
is
there
some
document?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
i
assume
they
could
be
counted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
infer
from
their
position
that
formal
psychiatric
or
psychoanalytic
sessions
are
not
necessarily
different
in
their
objectives
than
clinical
counseling
in
the
more
ordinary
sense,
assuming
there's
an
aura
of
confidentiality
about
it,
where
the
confidentiality
is
expected
on
both
sides.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
propriety
of
that
particular
resolution
i'm
not
sure
is
before
us,
or
that
the
court
is
interested
in,
but
it
seems
to
me
very
odd.
it's
standard
for
you
to
ask
a
witness,
have
you
talked
to
your
attorney,
and
the
unprepared
witnesses
will
say,
oh,
no.
well,
everybody
knows
that
that's
incredible,
but
if
the
witness
responds
in
that
incredible
way,
that
isn't
an
open
door
to
then
inquire
about
all
the
conversations
with
the
attorney.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
is
any
kind
of
a
privilege,
that
the
same
rule
should
apply
here.
if
she
makes
a
statement
that's
incredible
that
she
didn't
go
to
a
social
worker
or
that
she
didn't
discuss
the
event,
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
opens
the
door
under
the
trial
judge's
ruling
to
explore
everything
that
was
said
under
any
conventional
privilege.
now,
if
you
want
to
have
some
different
sort
of
privilege
here,
i
suppose
that's
something
altogether
separate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
how
about
the
circuits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
balancing.
that's
a
boundary
to
the
privilege.
it
prevents
the
abuse
of
the
privilege.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
requirements
or
the
exigencies
of,
and
the
necessities
of
producing
the
information
in
a
particular
case,
and
i'm
quite
surprised
that
you
support
the
balancing
idea.
i
should
have
thought
you
would
say
the
privilege
either
should
be
granted
or
it
shouldn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
those
persons
who
hold
that
privilege
have
a
duty
of
confidentiality
under
their
own
professional
ethical
standards?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
saying
that
the
courts
should
not
recognize
what
is
generally
understood
as
a
duty
of
confidentiality,
even
in
the
patient-client,
patient-doctor
relation,
much
less
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
allows
us--
--the
fact
that
a
client
expects
that
his
communications
to
an
attorney
are
going
to
be
confidential
is
relevant
in
our
creation
of
the
privilege,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
not
just
that
state's
policy.
it's
according
to
the
licentiature
system,
the
licensing
system
of
the
state,
more
dignity
than
the
state
itself
gives--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
have
the
same
trouble
as
justice
scalia
does.
i'm
not
sure
how
to
handle
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
look
to
licensing,
plus
the
extent
of
privilege,
state
by
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
the
rubric
of
whether
or
not
there's
a
reasonable
justification
to
believe
that
the
communication
is
confidential?
