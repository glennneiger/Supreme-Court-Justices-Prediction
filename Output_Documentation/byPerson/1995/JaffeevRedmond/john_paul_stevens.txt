mr.
rogus,
do
you
know
if
there
are
any
states
that
recognize
a
psychotherapist
privilege
and
do
not
recognize
a
doctor-patient
privilege?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
in
this
case
would
illinois
have
recognized
a
privilege
for
what's
at
issue
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
that
this
communication
would
be
privileged
in
the
illinois
courts?
you
don't,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
true
that
the
rule
they
apply
is
governed...
in
the
state
law
cases
is
governed
by
the
law
in
the
state
where
the
conversation
occurred,
rather
than
where
the
case
is
being
tried?
