justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
whole
notion
of
the
continuance
and
so
forth?
is
the
jury
that
hears
the
penalty
determination
the
same
as
the
trial
jury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
were,
is
it
customary
in
penalty
hearings
after
a
jury's
been
impaneled
and
heard
the
merits
of
the
case
and
then
sits
down
to
hear
the
penalty,
to
grant,
say,
a
30-day
continuance?
would
that
be
normal
in
your
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there's
anything...
the
lawyer
for
the
defendant
did
say
he
was
unprepared
to
meet
the
evidence.
that
much
is
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
the
judge
would
have
granted
a
continuance
if
he'd
been
specifically
asked
for
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
he
does
have
a
duty
to
terminate
the
proceeding
as
promptly
as
he
can
with
a
sitting
jury
right
there,
and
if
he
thinks
the
evidence
is
admissible,
as
he
ruled,
why
would
he
grant
the
continuance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
he'd
say,
how
much
time
do
you
need,
and
the
judge...
and
he
probably
would
have
said,
i
need
at
least
30
days,
wouldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying
he
in
effect
did
have
notice.
let
me
put
another
hypothetical
question
to
you.
if
we
assume...
i
know
you
don't
think
this
is
correct,
in
either
event.
1)
that
the
prosecutor
deliberately
misled
the
defense
counsel,
and
2)
that
the
judge
clearly
would
not
have
granted
the
continuance,
and
it
made
it
impossible
to
prepare
for...
would
the
proceeding
then
have
been
fundamentally
unfair?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
olive,
can
i
ask
you
kind
of
a
question
about
virginia
law?
what
is
the
threshold,
if
any,
that
limits
the
prosecutor's
ability
to
put
in
in
a
penalty
hearing
evidence
of
some
other
murder
that
you
have
very
little
reason
to
believe
the
defendant
committed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
threshold
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
they
put
in,
and
just
say
give
notice...
i'm
going
to
serve
notice
that
i'm
going
to
prove
that
the
unabomber
committed
a
lot
of
crimes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
enough?
