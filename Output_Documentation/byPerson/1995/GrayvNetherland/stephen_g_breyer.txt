justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
there
a
claim...
sorry.
were
you
finished
responding
to
the
chief?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
there
was
a
claim
which
people
have
called
the
inadequate
notice
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
let's
forget
the
content
of
that
claim
for
the
moment,
but
there's
something
called
an
inadequate
notice
claim.
now,
my
reading
of
this
suggests
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
said
such
claim
was
consistently
raised
in
the
state
courts
and
is
not
procedurally
defaulted,
that
also
in
your
brief
in
that
court
you
said,
inadequate
notice
was
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
in
state
habeas
corpus,
that
in
one
of
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceedings
they
said,
or
you
argued,
i
guess,
that
you...
or
conceded
that
the
inadequate
notice
subclaim
was
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
in
state
habeas
corpus,
that
the
state
habeas
corpus
court
found
that
number
9,
which
is
the
inadequate
notice
claim,
was
decided
adversely
at
trial--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
on
direct
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
that's
why
they
never...
so
then
the
only
question
is...
and
you
never
said
anything
to
the
contrary
in
any
brief
in
the
fourth
circuit.
so
now
we
can
try
to
divide
that
inadequate
notice
claim
into
two
parts,
i
guess.
one,
we
could
say
the
claim
of,
it
was
inadequate
notice
and
therefore
they
should
have
kept
the
evidence
out,
versus
the
claim
that,
it
was
inadequate
notice
and
therefore
they
should
have
given
us
more
time.
that's
what
you
want
to
do,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or,
i
mean,
i've
never
met
in
any
case
in
any
supreme
court,
or
in
any
court
that
i've
ever
seen
that
people
divided
things
that
finely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
and
that's
why
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
we
should
go
off
on
these
procedural
bars,
and
whether
it
was
adequately
raised
and
so
forth.
that's
my
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
on
the
merits,
and
i
thought
we
granted
this
case
because
we
wanted
to
see
whether
the
issue
that
they
were
trying
to
raise
was
teague-barred.
now,
all
these
procedural
things
and
notice
things
are,
i
suppose
designed
to
say
we
cannot
reach
that
issue,
and
that's
why
i
raise
them,
and
the
reason
i
ask
my
question
is,
why
can't
we
reach
the
issue?
these
were
matters
of
some
controversy,
the
procedural
thing,
they've
all
been
decided
against
you
below,
et
cetera.
you've
conceded
it
pretty
much.
why
don't
we
get
to
the
main
issue?
that's...
i'm
looking
for
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how,
here,
in
fact,
are
we
interfering
with
the
state
court
when
the
state's
own
court
on
habeas
said
all
these
issues
were
presented?
at
least
something
called
the
adequate
notice
claim
was
presented,
and
indeed,
the
reason
it
wouldn't
decide
it
on
state
habeas
was
because
it
believed
that
the
adequate
notice
claim
had
been
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court
on
direct
appeal,
or
do
i
have
that
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
when
i
read--
--did--
--in
the
transcript...
my
understanding
might
be
factually
wrong.
i
thought
the
trial
begins
on
monday,
and
on
that
day
or
before,
the
defense
counsel
learns
there's
only
going
to
be
snitch
evidence
about
sorrell.
on
thursday
evening,
for
the
first
time,
after
the
guilty
verdict,
trial
counsel
learns
there's
going
to
be
pictures,
other
testimony,
a
whole
lot
of
things
about
sorrell.
on
the
next
morning,
friday
morning,
not
3
days
later,
12
hours
later,
the
trial
begins
on
the
guilt
phase,
and
the
lawyer
goes
in
and
says,
judge,
i'm
totally
surprised
about
this
other
evidence.
is
that
basically
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
need
the...
what
i'm
really
interested
in
is,
my
impression
is
it's
only
a
matter
of
half
a
day,
or
hours,
between
the
time
that
the
defense
counsel
first
learns
about
this
other
evidence
and
the
time
he
makes
his
objection,
and
then
it
begins.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right,
and
that's
when
it
all
came
in,
friday.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
there's
a
matter
of
a
few
hours.
then
on
that
friday
morning...
i've
looked
through
this
testimony,
i
mean,
the
motion,
and
i
agree
with
you,
what
he
calls
it
at
the
beginning
is
a
motion.
he
doesn't
say
what
it's
a
motion
to
do.
then,
out
of
four
pages
of
transcript,
approximately
three
or
four
paragraphs
is
devoted
to
his
complaints
about
the
surprise,
and
then
he
also
says,
exclusion,
but
it's
somewhat
ambiguous
in
that
first...
would
your
normal
experience
in
virginia
practice
suggest
that
under
those
circumstances
the
judge
would
think
the
reason
i'm
not
going
to
give
him
a
continuance
is
that
he's
never
asked
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
four
paragraphs
in
which
he
complains
nonstop,
i
was
surprised,
i
don't
have
time,
we
just
learned
about
this
within
the
last
few
hours,
they're
about
to
go...
i
mean,
what
about
all
that?
might
that
not
provide
a
reason
for
a
listener
to
think
he
would
like
some
time?
