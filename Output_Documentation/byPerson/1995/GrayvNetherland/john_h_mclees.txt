mr.
john
h.
mclees
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
stated
simply,
the
essence
of
mr.
gray's
position
is
that
the
common...
is
that
the
constitution
required
exclusion
of
this
sorrell
murders
evidence
because
of
what
was,
at
the
very
worst,
a
discovery
violation.
now,
if
it
was
reasonable
for
the
trial
court
to
conclude
that
the
constitution
did
not
require
exclusion
of
that
evidence,
then
the
ruling
that
gray
is
asking
for
today
would
be
a
new
rule
in
federal
habeas
corpus,
and
it
cannot
be
announced
in
review
of
a
state
court
judgment.
we
submit
that
it
was
eminently
reasonable
for
the
trial
court
to
conclude
the
constitution
didn't
require
exclusion
of
this
evidence.
it
would
be
reasonable
even
today,
much
less
in
19--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--well,
if
it
were
a
straightforward
application
of
the
donnelly
test...
donnelly
v.
dechristoforo,
where
prosecutorial
misconduct,
if
it
infects
the
entire
proceeding
with
unfairness,
amounts
to
a
due
process
violation...
if
it
were
simply
a
straightforward
application
of
that
standard,
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
a
new
rule.
a
couple
of
interesting
things
preliminarily:
number
1,
if
it
were...
number
1,
in
his
reply
brief
at
page
6
he
says
it's
not
just
a
prosecutorial
misconduct
case,
and
we
can
only
take
him
at
his
word.
we're
not
sure
what
it
is,
but
he
says
it's
not
a
straight
prosecutorial
misconduct
case.
number
2--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--some
kind
of
hybrid--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--he
tries
to
make
it
a
hybrid
claim,
and
for
that
reason
we
submit
it's
a
new
rule,
but
even
if
it
were
simply
a
matter
of
applying
donnelly,
not
only
is
it
contrary
to
what
his
conception
of
his
rule
is,
it
wouldn't
be
cert
worthy
for
this
court
to
simply
decide
if
the
facts
of
this
case
met
the
donnelly
standard.
but
even
if
this
court
addressed
the
donnelly
standard,
that
requires
a
showing
that
the
misconduct,
or
what
the
prosecutor
did,
rendered
the
proceeding
fundamentally
unfair.
in
fact,
the
touchstone
of
due
process
in
cases
of
that
sort
is
not
the
prosecutor's
good
faith
or
bad
faith.
that's
why,
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
district
court,
we
didn't
ask
the
prosecutor
why
he
said
this,
and
how
this
happened,
how
he
made...
how
he
misspoke
himself
or
what,
because
that
was
not
an
issue.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
well--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--my--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--my
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
on
this
record,
if
you...
even
if
you
assume
that
it
was
intentional
misleading,
you
cannot
find
that
it
infected
the
entire
sentencing
proceeding
with
unfairness
for
several
reasons.
number
1,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
several
questions,
he
could
have
asked
for
a
continuance
when
he
found
what...
when
he
learned
at
the
outset
of
the
penalty
proceedings
that
there
was
additional
evidence
coming
in.
number
2--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--he
said,
we
are
not
prepared,
therefore
exclude
this
evidence,
because
we're
not
prepared
and
because
it
exceeds
the
parameters
of
the
watkins
case.
he
never
said,
we're
not
prepared,
give
us
more
time,
and
there's
a
world
of
difference...
of
course,
when
a
lawyer
speaks,
when
a
trial
advocate
speaks,
there's
a
world
of
difference
between
saying,
we're
not
prepared,
exclude
this
evidence,
which
can
and
very
often
is
for
the...
said,
that
position
is
taken
for
the
very
tactical
reasons
that
justice
kennedy
pointed
out.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
he
did
not
present
this
as
a
prosecutorial
misconduct
case
in
the
state
courts,
your
honor.
he
presented
it
as
a
case
of
inadmissible
evidence
coming
in.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
he
said
it
was
unfair
because
this
evidence
came
in,
but
he
said
that
this
evidence
should
have
been
kept
out
for
different
reasons
than
what
he's
saying
today.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
he
wasn't
talking
about
misleading.
the
district--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--we
argued
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
all
he
had
preserved
in
the
state
courts
was
the
claim
that
this
evidence
should
not
come
in,
because
he
had...
it
was
unadjudicated
misconduct,
he
had
no
notice
of
it
in
advance,
and
melvin
tucker's
testimony
was
too
slender
a
reed
to
rely
on
to
tie
it
to
mr.
gray.
melvin
tucker's
testimony
was
inherently
unreliable.
we
argued
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
fourth
circuit,
as
we
do
here
on
brief,
that
all
the
evidence
that
he
proffered
in
the
district
court
is
barred
by
keeney
v.
tamayo-reyes,
because
he
never
proffered
any
evidence
in
the
state
court.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
not
in
the
sense--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--i
don't
know
that
i
specifically
responded
to
those
points
because
i
didn't
understand
him
to
make
those
points.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
i
don't
believe
that
we
argued
the...
against
the
idea
of
misleading
prosecutorial
misconduct
because
we
did
not
understand
that
to
be
his
claim.
nor
did
the
fourth
circuit.
nor
did
the
district
court.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
absolutely,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
fourth...
that's
how
the
fourth
circuit
read
it.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
yes,
thank
you.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
right.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
yes.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
well--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--i--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--well,
because...
because,
your
honor,
whether
you
characterize
it
as
an
inadequate
notice
claim
or
a
prosecutorial
misconduct
claim,
or
some
hybrid
combination
of
the
two,
the
bottom
line
is,
what
effect
did
it
have
on
the
penalty
trial?
did
it
render
the
penalty
proceeding
fundamentally
unfair?
mr.
john
h.
mclees
well,
if
the
issue
is
the
teague
bar
to
the
notice
claim,
i
think
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
notice
claim.
they
rely
on...
they
seem
to
rely
primarily
on
two
cases.
one
is
gardner
v.
florida,
which
deals
with
how
much
the
defense
has
a
constitutional
right
to
know
about
the
evidence
against
him
and
when,
and
the
other
is
langford
v.
idaho,
that...
which
he
never
cited
even
in
his
petition
for
certiorari,
but
is
heavily
relied
on
in
his
brief
on
the
merits
now,
which
deals
with
notice
of
issues
before
a
proceeding,
or
during
a
proceeding.
now,
in
langford,
i
think
it
is
different
from
this
case
and
therefore
this
case
doesn't
come
under
the
langford
rule
for
three
major
reasons.
number
1,
it's
different
in
level
of
application,
number
2,
it's
different
in
timing,
and
number
3,
it's
different
in
showing
of
prejudice.
in--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--well,
if
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
defense
attorney
had
to
expressly
ask
for
continuance,
there's
a
reason
why
we
draw
a
fine
line
between
asking
for
a
continuance
and
objecting
and
asking
for
exclusion--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--more
broadly,
it
is.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
exactly.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
the
petitioner
in
his
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
fact
on
his
petition
for
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
asked
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
to
revisit
the
claim,
the
decision
that
had
been
made
on
the
direct
appeal,
and
the
issue
raised
on
the
direct
appeal.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
no,
exactly.
i
don't
accede
to
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
mean
to
waive
our
procedural
bar
or
limit
that
we've
made
on
brief
by
addressing
other
questions.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
no,
your
honor.
it's
unusual.
in
fact,
the
rule
says
that
the
penalty
proceeding
should
be
conducted
as
soon
as
practicable
after
the
guilt
proceeding,
but
the
trial
court
certainly
would
have
the
discretion
to
grant
a
recess
for
continuance
if
the
defense
asked
for
it
and
showed
good
cause
for
it.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
that's
correct.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
that
suggests
that
he
would
not
have
granted
the
continuance,
but
i
think
the
shoe
has
to
be
on
the
other
foot.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
if
the
defense
said,
we
haven't
had
enough
time
to
marshal
rebuttal
for
this
evidence,
and
we
think--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--well--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--if
you
take
mr.
gray
at
his
word,
he
would
have
said,
your
honor,
no
amount
of
preparation
time
would
ever
be
adequate
to
meet
this,
because
that's
what
they
said
in
their
state
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
so
that's
why
he
wanted
exclusion
and
not
a
continuance,
not
a
delay,
but
at
the
outset
of
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence,
on
the
monday
the
trial
began,
detective
slezak,
who
was
the
chesapeake
detective,
the
only
connection
he
has
with
this
case
is
that
he
was
the
investigating
officer
on
the
sorrell
murders.
detective
slezak's
name
was
called
out
in
open
court
as
one
of
the
subpoenaed
witnesses
of
the
commonwealth,
and
that's
at
page
1484
of
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--no,
because
still,
to
show
fundamental
unfairness
of
the
proceeding,
he,
mr.
gray,
as
a
habeas
corpus
petitioner,
would
have
to
show
how
the
result...
how
the
proceeding
would
have
gone
differently,
how
the
result
probably
would
have
been
different
had
the
evidence
either
been
excluded,
or
had
he
been
granted
the
continuance.
first
of
all,
defense
counsel
who
defended
mr.
gray
at
trial
had,
after
the
jury
penalty
trial
in
the
first
week
of
december
1985,
they
had
2
months
between
that
time
and
the
sentencing
hearing
before
the
judge
alone
in
february
1986,
within
which
they
could
have
investigated
the
sorrell
murders,
uncovered
whatever
they
wanted
to
say
about
timothy
sorrell,
and
presented
that
to
the
trial
judge
in
support
of
a
motion
for
a
new
penalty
proceeding
or
a
new
trial.
they
could
have
done
that
within
that
2
months.
they
could
have
done
it
any
time
within
21
days
after
sentence
had
been
pronounced.
they
did
not
do
that,
and
i
should
point
out
that
we
introduced--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--if...
if--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--if
your
objection
is
that
evidence
was
wrongly
excluded
from
a
proceeding,
either
a
guilt
or
innocence
trial--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--or
a
penalty
proceeding,
you
waive
the
objection
unless
you
make
a
proffer
of
what
the
evidence
would
have
been.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
well,
no.
wrongly
admitted,
it's
not
waived,
but
when
we
go
from
the...
when
we
go...
on
their
claim,
when
we
go
from
the
claim
that
you
just
flat
shouldn't
have
admitted
this
evidence
because
there
was
something
inherently
wrong
with
it,
to
the
claim
that,
well,
you
should
have
given
us
more
time,
because
had
he
given
us
more
time
we
would
have
come
up
with
all
of
this
information
about
timothy
sorrell,
then
we're
talking
about
the
effect
of
it
being
that
they
weren't
able
to
rebut
it
with
this
other
evidence.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
not
exactly,
your
honor.
may
i
just
review--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--the
entire
history
of
it--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--the
prosecutor
informed
defense
counsel
that
he
was
going
to
introduce
this
sorrell
murders
evidence,
the
photographs
and
autopsy
report--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--on
thursday
evening
before
the
friday
morning
when
the
penalty
phase
began.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
i...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
yes.
now,
that
could
go
either
way.
some...
it
depends
on
the
judge,
and
with
a
given
judge,
it
might
depend
on
the
day
or
the
case.
the
judge
might
say,
as
judge
spencer
did
with
me
in
the
district
court,
if
you
feel
surprised,
if
you
want
more
time,
i'll
give
you
a
continuance
if
you
want
it.
the
judge
certainly
wouldn't
say,
i'm
going
to
delay
this
proceeding
for
30
days
because
of
what
you
said,
without
clearing
with
defense
counsel
that
that's
what
he
was
asking.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
none.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
exactly.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
not
unless
he
says
he
would
like
some
time,
your
honor.
we're
talking--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--i
respectfully
disagree,
justice
ginsburg.
i
think
that
that
is
an
unreasonable
and
erroneous
interpretation
of
it.
the
district
court
itself...
and
mr.
gray
in
his
reply
brief
likes
to
compare
my
position
at
the
beginning
of
the
evidentiary
hearing
with
his
position
at
the
beginning
of
the
penalty
hearing
when
i
objected
that
the
issue
that
was
to
be
tried
was
broadened
on
the
morning
of
the
hearing,
and
the
judge
said,
i'll
give
you
a
continuance
if
you
want.
now,
the
happenstance
that
judge
spencer
said
that
and
the
state
judge
does
not
is
not
of
constitutional
dimension.
what
i
did
at
that
point
was,
i
didn't
want
a
continuance
because
i
had
gone
to
a
lot
of
trouble
to
prepare
for
that
day,
and
i
had
my
witnesses
lined
up,
the
same
as
the
defense
counsel
in
the
penalty
trial.
i
said,
if
we
get
to
the
end
of
this
hearing
and
there's
some
more
evidence
i
feel
like
i'd
like
to
put
on,
i'd
like
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
he
said,
fine.
in
the
second
day,
we
put
on...
and
this
is
all
in
the
record.
in
the
second
day
we
put
in
some
additional
exhibits
that
we
hadn't
disclosed
to
them
ahead
of
time.
he
said,
fine,
and
that
cured
it,
but
i
didn't
go
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
say,
they
shouldn't
have
held
that
hearing
because
i
didn't
know
until
the
day
of
the
hearing
what
the
subject
of
it
was
going
to
be.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
i
don't
think
that
he
wins
or
loses
depending
on
what
cases
he
cites,
your
honor.
he
wins
or
loses
depending
on
what
he
says
the
violation
of
his
rights
was,
and
how
he
ties
it
to...
or
how
he
explains
the
right
that
he
says
was
violated.
if...
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
comply
with
that
could
have
simply
said,
my
rights
were
violated
because
i
wasn't
given
enough
time
to
prepare
a
defense
to
this
particular
sorrell
murders
evidence,
and
if
i
had
been
given
enough
time,
i
would
have
come
up
with
this
other
evidence.
but
the
evidence...
the
information
about
timothy
sorrell
was
published
in
the
newspapers,
and
we
introduced
the
articles
in
december
of
1984,
5
months
before
the
mcclelland
murders
were
committed,
and
that
was
open
to
defense
counsel
as
well
as
the
prosecution.
they
could
have
asked...
they
could
have
presented
that
evidence.
they
could
have
investigated
that
and
presented
what
they
found
from
that.
just
knowing
that
the
prosecution
was
going
to
put
on
mr.
tucker's
testimony
about
the
sorrell
murders
evidence,
they
could
have
put
this
other
evidence
in
about
mr.
sorrell
if
they
could
find
any
competent
admissible
evidence,
which
they
certainly
didn't
present
in
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
well,
because,
your
honor,
that's
not
the
position
they
took
at
the
time.
at
the
time,
if
the
court
looks
at
the
record
of
the...
when
they
asked...
on
the
monday
morning,
when
they
asked
the
prosecutor
what
evidence
he's
going
to
present
in
the
penalty
phase,
they
say,
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
you're
going
to
put
on
evidence
connecting
mr.
gray
with
the
sorrell
murders,
that
he
may
have...
evidence
that
he
may
have
told
some
other
people
he
committed
the
murders.
this
evidence
is
absolute
dynamite,
and
we
need
to
be
prepared
for
that.
so
even
the
snitch
testimony
they
regarded
as
absolute
dynamite.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
but
even
after
the
penalty
phase
proceeding,
they
didn't
investigate
the
other...
they
didn't
investigate
the
timothy
sorrell
angle
and
present
that
evidence
to
try
to
get
a
new
trial,
because
they
concluded
that
they
had
adequately--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--we
have
argued
that.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
i
believe
we
did,
your
honor.
we
made
it
in
our
fourth
circuit
brief.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
i
believe
we
did.
we
said
they
could
have
been
done
then,
and
therefore
could
have
been
presented
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
not
as
a
procedural
bar,
but
as
it
reflects
to
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
sentencing
proceeding,
it's
still
relevant
whether
it's
a
procedural
bar
or
not,
because
it
shows
that--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--not
exactly,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
as
a
habeas
corpus
petitioner,
it
is
incumbent
upon
mr.
gray
to
show
what
difference
all
these
alleged
violations
make,
and
how
the
proceeding--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--in
state
habeas
and
in
federal
habeas.
mr.
john
h.
mclees
even
if
we--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--because
i
think
it's
relevant,
your
honor,
to
a
showing
of
prejudice,
to
showing...
if
you
just
look
at
this
case
on
the
merits--
mr.
john
h.
mclees
--i
see
my
time
has
expired.
