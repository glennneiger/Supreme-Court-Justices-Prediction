justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olive,
where
did
the
district
judge
get
this
notion.
the
district
judge
said,
despite
the
defense
plea
for
additional
time
to
prepare,
the
state
trial
court
proceeded
without
a
break.
that
implies
that
there
was
a
request
comparable
to
one
for
a
continuance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
explicit
plea
for
additional
time,
as
distinguished
from
exclusion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
the
paper
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
there
seems
to
be
a
request
for
exclusion.
that's
the
only
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mclees,
before
we
get
to
specific
cases,
there's
one
overall
problem
that's
troubling
me
about
saying,
i
told
all
the
facts
about
what
happened,
and
i
pinned
some
kind
of
general
due
process
label
on
it,
but
not
necessarily
the
right
one,
and
then
i
think
about
how
civil
proceedings
are,
where
we
know,
if
you
don't
ask
for
the
right
relief
but
you're
entitled
to
it,
rule
54(c)
says
you
get
it,
and
yet
we
seem
to
be
demanding
this
persnicketiness
in
proceeding
on
the
criminal
side,
when
it's
a
question
literally
of
life
or
death.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
there's
something
out
of
sync
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mclees,
the
district
judge,
who
i
understand
was
an
experienced
prosecutor
himself,
read
it
that
way.
he
read
what...
the
transcript,
and
he
said
the
sentence
that
i
recited
to
you
before.
he
understood
this,
the
district
court
understood
this
to
be
a
defense
plea
for
additional
time
to
prepare,
so
it
certainly
could
be
read
that
way.
it
seems
to
me
it's
at
the
least
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mclees,
i
want
to
follow
up
on
this
business
of
meticulousness
in
pleadings,
because
it
seems
that
it
turns
entirely
on
the
lawyer
appointed
to
represent
the
defendant,
because
i'm
looking
at
2254
forms,
the
forms
that
people
are
given
to...
when
they
want
to
petition
for
habeas
corpus
from
a
state
court
judgment,
and
the
instructions
are,
state
your
facts,
tell
your
story
briefly
without
citing
cases
or
law,
and
that's
adequate.
that's
the
instructions
that
the
pleader
was
given.
so
the
pleading
is
sufficient
without
citing
cases
or
law,
but
then
the
defendant
wins
or
loses
depending
on
what
cases
and
law
his
appointed
counsel
cites?
