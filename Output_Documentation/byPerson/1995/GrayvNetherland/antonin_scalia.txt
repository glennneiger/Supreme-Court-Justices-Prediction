justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
not
just
yet,
it's
that
the
words
were
spoken,
please
exclude
this
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
the
court
should
have
sua
sponte
proposed
this
alternative.
i
mean,
that's
another
possible
argument
you
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
argue
this
on
appeal,
either,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
the
objection
on
appeal
that
this
evidence
was
not
admissible,
or
was
the
objection
that
you
should
have
been
given
more
time?
the
only
thing
i
see
on
the
appeal
record
is
that
you
said
it
was
not
admissible.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
isn't
whether
there's
notice
or
not.
the
question
is
what
is
the
consequence
of
not
having
notice,
and
as
i
understand
what
you
argued
on
appeal,
it
was
that
since
there
was
not
notice,
among
other
reasons,
it
should
have
been
excluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
you
now
know
through
discovery
that
even
at
the
time
he
made
that
statement
he
intended
to
introduce
additional
evidence,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
and
so
you
can
make
the
sandbagging
claim.
you
did
not
know
that,
however,
until
after
direct
appeal
had
been
completed,
isn't
that
right,
so
you
couldn't
have
made
this
claim
on
direct
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
withheld,
which
is
different.
i
mean,
that's
just
a
lack
of
notice.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
that
he
maliciously,
you
know,
ambushed
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
didn't
know
that
at
the
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
you
conducted
the
discovery
that
enabled
you
to
conclude
that
he
didn't
just
change
his
mind
but
rather
intentionally
told
you
one
thing
when
he
planned
at
the
time
to
do
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
changed
his
mind.
he
might
have
changed
his
mind,
in
which
case
your
argument
would
be,
lack
of
notice,
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
malicious
and
sandbagging
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
me
any
reference
to
the
claim
you
are
now
making
in
the
state
courts,
any
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor,
knowing
that
he
intended
to
introduce
other
evidence,
misled
you
into
thinking
that
he
was
only
going
to
introduce
one
type
of
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
knowing
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
notice
claim.
well,
mr.
olive,
are
you
making...
you're...
are
you
making
an
argument
that
requires
a
finding
of
the
prosecutor's
bad
faith?
i
know
you
are
claiming
that
there
was
bad
faith,
but
are
you
resting
your
claim
to
relief
entirely
on
a
bad
faith
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
your
problem,
mr.
olive,
is
that
the
further
you...
the
further
away
you
get
from
prosecutorial
misconduct,
from
knowing
lying,
the
more
you
back
into
teague.
the
closer
you
can
bring
your
case
to
that,
to
that
the
prosecutor
said
one
thing
knowing
he
was
going
to
do
another,
it's
easier
to
make
the
argument
that
teague
doesn't
bar
this,
but
as
you
get
away
from
that,
certainly
all
the
way
over
to
a
notice
claim,
and
even
to
a
detrimental
reliance
claim,
it
may
be
true,
but
it's
new
stuff,
and
you'd
be
barred
in
this
habeas
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
teague.
that's
why
i
think
in
your
brief
and
in
all
your
arguments
to
this
court
you
are
trying
to
push
the
argument
towards
affirmative
misleading,
knowing
misleading
by
the
prosecution,
because
that's
your
best
way
out
of
teague.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
what
it
held,
and
what
it
was
reversed
on,
and
the
issue
is
whether
it
was
rightly
reversed.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
need
the
case.
you
need
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
need
the
case.
you
need
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
the
one
that
has
to
show
that
this
is
not...
you
know,
that
this
is
standard
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
certainly
not
done
intentionally,
and
to
say
that
you
did
it
intentionally,
i'd
have
some...
i'd
have
some
difficulty
saying
that
it
might
not
be
covered
by
teague,
but
if
it's
not
done
intentionally,
if
he
made
one
representation
then
changed
his
mind
and
put
on
something
else,
that's
a
quite
different
situation,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
would
be
making
new
law
if
we
find
that
that's
a
violation
of
due
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
did
you
argue--
--more
specifically
that
it
was
fundamentally
unfair
because
he
was
not
given
more
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
going
to
get
you
there,
mr.
mclees.
isn't
the
distinction
that
we
don't
set
aside
state
court,
state
supreme
court
judgments
in
civil
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
habeas
corpus.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
don't
have
the
problem
of
sandbagging
the
state
courts
by
resolving
issues
that
have
never
been
fairly
presented
to
them.
if
we
had
it
in
civil
cases,
we
might
behave
the
same
way.
we
probably
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mclees--
--mr.
mclees,
why
do
you
accede
to
the
notion
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
adequate
notion
claim,
or
adequate
notice
claim?
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
quite
separate
claims.
one,
i
was
deprived
of
due
process
because
this
evidence
was
not
excluded,
as
it
should
have
been,
and
that
was
the
case
presented
to
the
virginia
courts.
number
2,
i
was
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
because
i
was
not
given
enough
time
to
respond
to
this
new
evidence
that
came
in.
that
claim
was
never
presented
to
the
virginia
courts,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
reason
at
that
time
to
believe
that
he
wanted
a
continuance,
was
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact,
even
at
the
time
of
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
there
was
still
no
reason
to
believe
he
wanted
a
con...
he
is
still
saying,
at
the
time
of
the
state
habeas
corpus,
that
a
continuance
wouldn't
have
done
any
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
they
make
that
argument
on
habeas,
then,
on
state
habeas?
why
did
they
say
on
state
habeas--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no
amount
of
time
would
have
done
us
any
good?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
they
said.
do
you
want
me
to
read
it
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
they
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
was
hyperbole.
i
think
it
was
a
devastating
case,
and
i
think
the
defense
wanted
to
keep
that
evidence
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it
would
have
made
any
difference
to
the
defense
if
it
had
3
more
days.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
they
wanted
above
all
things
to
keep
that
evidence
out,
and
it's
very
important,
it
seems
to
me,
that
we
not
let
an
argument
that
wasn't
made,
a
request
that
was
not
made
to
the
states,
later
be
made
to
federal
courts
when
it
turns
out
that
the
trial
strategy
employed
by
the
defense
has
not
produced
the
result
desired.
