justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
think
the
answer
is
that,
so
what?
i
think
the
answer
is,
is
that
it's
not
clear
that
you
asked
for
a
continuance,
or
that
that
was
the
appropriate
remedy.
as
i
read
the
colloquy
in
the
trial
court,
both
on
the
morning
and
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day
of
the
sentencing
hearing,
the
discussion
was
on
the
watkins
case
and
whether
or
not
this
type
of
evidence
is
proper
at
all,
and
it's
certainly
open
to
interpretation
that
the
attorney
made
a
strategic
choice
not
to
ask
for
a
continuance.
that
way
he
could
preserve
the
objection
all
the
way
through,
and
a
continuance
might
have
actually
hurt
him
because
the
prosecution
would
have
had
even
more
time.
so
that's
my
concern.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
am
i
correct
that
trial
counsel
objected
to
the
admissibility
of
the
sorrels
evidence
regardless...
on
the
independent
ground
that
it
was
improper--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--regardless
of
the
matter...
of
the
amount
of
time
he
had
to
meet
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
if
that's
one
ground,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
the
objection
that
was
made.
it's
true
that
they
talk
about,
that
you
didn't
have
time,
but
there
was
no
request
for
a
continuance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
could
be
a
strategic
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
it
has
to
be
that,
because
let's
assume
that
there
was
deliberate
deception.
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
there
must
be
some
kind
of
punitive
sanction
put
on
the
prosecution.
we
ask
what
follows
from
the
deception.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
request
for
a
continuance?
is
there
a
request
to
exclude
the
evidence?
here,
the
thrust
of
the
argument
made
in
the
state
court
was
that
the
evidence
had
to
be
excluded,
and
now
you're
shifting
ground.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.--
--is--
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you're
talking
about
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
is
fundamentally
unfair,
do
you
agree
that
that
issue
has
been
preserved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
--in
the
state
courts,
did
he
preserve
the
argument
that
this
was
fundamentally
unfair
as
to
the...
or
that
the
whole
proceeding
was
defective
as
to
the
sentencing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
saying
that
he
did
not
then
preserve
the
argument
that
it
was
fundamentally
unfair
because
there
was
either
no
notice,
or
because
there
was
misleading--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
virginia
law
do
you
waive
your
right
to
object
to
the
regularity
of
a
sentencing
proceeding
if
you
don't
bring
up
the
same
matters
on
a
new
trial
motion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
required
to
present
these
matters
on
a
new
trial
motion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
how
about
wrongly
admitted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
he
didn't
say,
prepared
or
not
prepared,
did
he?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
very
important.
