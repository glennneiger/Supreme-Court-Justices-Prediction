mr.
mark
e.
olive
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
truth
is
discovered
through
fair
process.
truth
is
forever
lost
when
an
attorney
in
a
case
through
capital
sentencing
proceedings,
for
example,
utilizes
tactics
which
violate
moral
standards
of
fair
play.
in
coleman
gray's
capital
sentencing
proceeding,
the
process
was
not
fair,
and
the
truth
will
be
forever
lost
unless
this
court
reinstates
the
district
court's
judgment
that
the
state
may
not
mislead
defense
counsel
regarding
the
determinative
issues
at
trial.
the
commonwealth's
position
in
this
case
before
this
court
is
that
you
can
mislead.
it's
not
disputed
that
there
was
misleading,
and
the
answer
to
the
misleading
is,
so
what?
that
doesn't
matter.
the
state
can
do
that.
the
commonwealth
did
it,
but
you're
no
worse
off
as
a
result
of
it.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
let
me
address
that,
your
honor,
first
with
the
comment
that
i've
searched
the
respondent's
brief
and
can't
find
in
there
the
proposition
that
this
did
not
happen,
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
mislead
on
day
1
and
then
progress
in
the
misleading
on
the
subsequent
days.
but
the
part
of
the
record
which
i'll
be
referring
the
court
to,
of
course,
is
december
2nd
and
december
6th,
and
there
were
three
separate
requests,
your
honor,
at
that...
at
those
points
in
time
for
the
state
to
identify
what
would
be
introduced
under
the
preferred
practice
under
peterson.
when
they
got
to
the
day
where
the
commonwealth
came
in
and
said,
we've
changed
our
mind,
there
was
a
discussion
about
watkins,
and
the
discussion
about
watkins,
from
the
point
of
view
of
defense
counsel,
your
honor,
was
the
comparison
between
watkins
and
what
was
going
on
in
this
case.
and
the
specific
point
was
made
that
in
watkins,
where
murders
were
introduced
at
capital
sentencing,
defense
counsel
in
those
cases,
in
that
case
was
also
defense
counsel
in
the
case
that
was
being
introduced,
and
there
was
a
charge,
and
defense
counsel
knew,
had
notice
of
what
the
facts
were
involved
in
that
case,
and
so
the
watkins
argument
really
was
twofold.
1.
yes,
this
evidence
is
admissible,
but
in
watkins,
it
was
admissible
against
an
attorney
and
a
defendant
that
were
prepared.
the
argument
in
this
case,
and
making
the
contrast
with
watkins,
was
specifically
that...
and
i'll
give
the
quote
from
the
record,
page
777,
it
was
another...
this
is
defense
counsel
in
this
case.
there
was
another
murder
that
the
defense
counsel
were
actively
participating
in
representing
the
defendant.
but
contrast
this
case,
page
780.
the
defense
in
this
case,
your
honor,
was
taken
by
surprise.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
both.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
that
was
one
ground.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--the
direct
quote,
and
to
me
the
letter...
at
least
the
spirit,
if
not
the
letter
of
the
request
is
on
page
780
of
the
record,
and
this
is
after
tucker
testified.
we
were
prepared
for
that.
that
is,
the
information
that
the
commonwealth
told
us
they
were
going
to
introduce,
the
tucker
statements,
we
were
prepared
for
that,
that's
all
right,
but
we're
not
prepared
for
this,
and
the
court's
response
to,
you're
not
prepared,
could
have
been
to
grant
a
continuance
if
they
were
entitled
to
be
prepared,
or
to
exclude
the
evidence.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
the
words--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--no,
there
was...
the
words,
we
move
for
a
continuance,
were
not
spoken,
but
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
it
could
hardly
be
interpreted
to
me
in
any
other
fashion.
at
least
there
is
record
support
for,
we're
not
prepared
to
go
forward,
as
a
motion
for
a
continuance--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--and
those
record
citations
are
to
the
state
court
trial
record
that
are
in
the
opinion
at
that
point.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
it
is
quite
true
the
words
were
not
spoken,
please
continue
this
case,
but
i...
the...
it
has
the
same
effect,
and
let
me
say
why--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that's
correct,
but
the
court
was
placed...
the
court
was
observing
defense
counsel
in
a
predicament,
and
the
court
had
been
there
from
the
beginning
of
the
predicament
to
the--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i
think
that...
that's
true,
and
perhaps
it
is
a
due
process
violation
when
the
court--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--on
direct
appeal,
the
issue
of
whether
there
should
have
been
a
continuance
or
not,
or--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--no.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
that
was
not
developed,
and
the
reason...
to
me,
a
fair
reading
of
this
record
is,
you
turn
to
a
judge
and
you
say,
your
honor,
we
need
a
continuance
in
this
case
because
we
are
not
prepared,
and
in
this
case,
the
ruling
is
the
law
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
which
is,
that
does
not
state
a
basis
for
a
continuance
because
you
are
not
entitled
to
be
prepared
under
virginia
commonwealth
law.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
the
federal
district
court
judge
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
what
was
being
said,
the
spirit
of
what
was
being
said
was,
we
need
more
time
to
prepare,
and
under
anderson
v.
city
of
bessemer
city,
even
when
the
court
is
looking
at
a
paper
record,
federal
district
court
is
looking
at
a
paper
record--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--it's--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well,
you
know,
when
i
stand
before
a
trial
judge
and
say,
i'm
not
ready,
and
the
trial
judge
basically
says
this
evidence
is
admissible
whether
you're
ready
or
not,
then
a
continuance
is
superfluous.
a
continuance
could
not
show
anything
to
the
judge
that
would
be
of
any
moment.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
on
appeal
to
the--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--oh,
on
the
appeal
record
at
pages...
the
direct
appeal
brief,
at
page
3
and
maybe
a
little
bit
before
that,
again,
defense
counsel
and
appellate
counsel
brings
forth
the
same
comparison
between
the
watkins
case
and
this
case,
and
the
comparison
is
on
notice,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
it's
not
on
admissibility,
or
don't
admit
it.
it
is
in
watkins,
counsel
knew...
counsel
knew
this
information.
they
didn't
need
notice,
and
that--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--the
remedy
that
was
sought...
i
don't
know
that
you
have
to
go
to
a
state
or
commonwealth
trial
court
judge
and
say,
please
stop
this
from
happening
to
me,
it
violates
my
right
to
a
fair
trial,
and
then
because
you
say,
please
exclude
this
evidence,
as
opposed
to
please
give
me
more
time,
that
somehow
the
defendant's
due
process
rights
have
been
waived.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
it
is...
the
language
is,
we
were
taken
by
surprise.
we
weren't
ready,
and
that's--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that
is
not
contained
in
the...
the
language
of
it,
directly,
is
not
expressly
contained
there,
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
the
district
court
a
tually
dealt
not
with
notice
but
with
prosecutor
misconduct
or
deception
with
respect
to
what
the
issues
would
be.
what
the
district
court
expressly
focused
on
and
found
was
not
that
it
was
a
failure
of
notice,
but
that
it
was
the
prosecutor
violating
his
unequivocal
pledge
and
ambushing
the
defense
through
tactics
after
violating...
planning
to
violate
his
direct
promise,
and
this
is
the
j.a.
at
350,
and
the
prosecutor
planned
to
violate
his
direct
promise.
so
it
was
not
so
much
in
the
district
court
an
issue
of
notice
as
an
issue
of
a
prosecutor
taking
away
someone's
due
process
rights
by
saying
we're
going
to
do
a
and
then
actually
introducing
the
issue
of
b.--
now,
in
the
fourth
circuit,
it
is
quite
right
that
the
respondent
was
successful
at
calling
the
issue
one
of
notice
and
actually
going
so
far
as
to
call
it
one
of
discovery
of
every
piece
of
evidence,
which
has
never
been
the
complaint
in
this
case.
the
complaint
has
always
been,
we
were
told
on
day
1
that
x
was
going
to
happen,
and
we
were
told
on
day
4
that
y
was
going
to
happen,
and
x
was
an
intentional
misstatement.
it
intended
to
deflect
us
in
developing
proof
on
one
of
the
most
inflammatory
cases
in
the
history
of
the
tidewater
area,
and
the
reason
that
that
tactic
was
utilized
is
because
the
case
couldn't
be
proved
in
a
fair
proceeding.
the
commonwealth
came
to
this
proceeding
and
said
to
defense
counsel,
we're
going
to
do
a.
if
we
let
you
know
about
b
and
c
too
soon,
you'll
find
out
that
there's
no
proof
that
coleman
gray
committed
the
sorrells
crime.
the
only
way
we
can
prove
it
by
the
way
we're
going
to
go
about
proving
it
is
deflection--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--in
the
district
court
at
page
352
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
district
court
does
talk
about
notice,
but
the
district
court
also
refers
to
the
moral
standards
of
fair
play
after
describing
what
can
only
be
described
of,
if
you
accept
it
as
correct,
not
especially
moral,
a
plan
to
violate
a
direct
promise
to
defense
counsel.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
but
when
i
go
on
in
that
sentence,
the
district
court
judge
spencer
is
saying
the
commonwealth's
attorney,
ferguson's
tactics,
and
that's
not
a
matter
of
notice,
per
se,
violated
the
moral
standards
of
fair
play
and
violated
the
due
process
clause,
so
to
me
that
is...
what
went
awry
here
was,
indeed,
notice,
but
this
is
notice
plus.
this
isn't
even
very
difficult.
this
is
intentional
misleading.
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
someone
was
given
3
days,
2
days,
4
days,
or
30
days,
and
whether
due
process
requires--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i...
my
position
on
the
state
court
record,
like
the
district
court's
position
on
it,
and
i
don't
think
it's
an
unreasonable
one,
is
when
i
stand
up
and
say,
i'm
not
ready,
the
judge
knows
that
i'm
asking
for
a
couple
of
things.
either
give
me
more
time,
or
keep
this
evidence
out.
that's
the
only
two
ways
of
interpreting
i'm
not
ready,
and
the
reason
the
judge
did
neither
is
because
commonwealth
law
doesn't
require
it.
you're
not
entitled
to
notice,
and
you're
not
entitled
to
be...
have
it
kept
out,
so
no
matter
what
you
show
on
a
continuance
it
does
not
matter.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
you
know
whether
you're
going
to
have
to
try
a
murder
case,
but
not
what
the
specific
items
of
evidence
are.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
the
preferred--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--he...
the
judge
did
not...
the
prosecutor
did
not
have
to
say
anything
under
commonwealth
law.
the
preferred
practice
under
commonwealth
law,
under
peterson,
and
by
the
way,
peterson
is
only
cited
one
other
time
in
the
last
13
years.
there's
not
a
lot
of
double
homicides
people
try
to
give
you
no
notice
of
and
introduce
them.
but
peterson
says
it
is
the
preferred
practice,
and
the
prosecutor
in
response
to,
here's
peterson,
what
are
you
going
to
do,
said
to
the
defense
counsel,
although
did
not
have
to,
but
said
to
defense
counsel,
i've
told
you,
counsel,
statements.
that's
all
i'm
going
to
be
introducing.
whereupon,
counsel's
response
would
naturally
be
reflexively,
phew,
no
more
about
this
case.
the
trial
here
is
only
snitch,
and
is
this
tucker
snitch
credible,
did
my
client
say
something
to
tucker,
instead
of
a
murder
trial.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
on
direct
appeal
the
claim
that
was
made
was
that
the
prosecutor
at
the
time
withheld--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well,
there
was
no
adjective
on
it,
but
what
was
placed--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--in
the
direct
appeal
was
something
to
me
that
sounds
relatively
volitional,
which
is
withholding.
it
is
relatively
affirmative.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i
think
that
the
proof
of
it
came
in
the
district
court.
i
think
that
the
claim,
however,
was
fairly
made
by
standing
there
on
day
1
and
having
the...
i
mean,
if
you're
at
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor
says,
i'm
only
going
to
do
a,
and
you
go,
great--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--it
could
actually
be
a
middle
ground.
it
could
be
wanton.
it
could
be
reckless.
it
could
be
a
circumstance
where
a
prosecutor
or
a
person
whose
obligation
it
is
to
seek
justice
was
just
exercising
reckless
disregard.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
think
on
the
direct
appeal
record--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i
think
on
the
direct
appeal
record
the
best
is
that
it
was
withheld,
and
in
the
trial
court--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i...
no.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
think
it
was
more,
but
for
purposes
of
your
question,
that
was
said.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
think
it's
both,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
a
detrimental
reliance.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
completely.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
correct.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
think
that
you
would.
i
don't
think--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
actually
it's
what
the
district
court
held,
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
uphold.
it
was
my
impression--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--the...
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
a
teague...
there
is
a
particular
teague
issue
to
the
claim
of,
i
am
not
ready,
with
notice
or
not,
to
try
a
double
homicide
today.
yes,
counsel,
you
will
try
this
double
homicide.
it
is
as
if...
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
case
law,
and
if
respondent
can
bring
it
to
our
attention,
even
at
this
date,
it
would
be
interesting,
that
says,
for
example,
to
take
something
out
of
the
news
and
not
to
pander
too
much,
but
says
at
sentencing,
counsel
in
this
case,
by
the
way,
we're
going
to
introduce
evidence
that
your
client
actually
is
the
unabomber,
but
it's
only
going
to
be
a
snitch.
and
then,
3
days
later,
well,
no,
actually
we're
going
to
show
some
pictures
of
victims,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that's
not--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--pardon?
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well,
you
know,
that's--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well,
it's
an
interesting
battle
of
who
needs
the
case,
and
i'll
drop
back
to
a
few
cases
i
think
support
my
position
from
the
fifties
and
sixties,
but
the
fact
that
there
is
not
necessarily
a
case
on
point
isn't
testimony
to
the
rule
of
law,
it's
testimony
to
what
prosecutors
normally
do.
this
doesn't
happen,
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
happen
is
because
everybody
knows
you
don't
go
in
and
tell
counsel
on
the
other
side
the
day
you're
going
to
prove
a
murder
case
in
the
capital
sentencing
proceeding,
we're
going
to
prove
a
different
murder
today.
it's
just
not
done.
so
the
fact
that
there
aren't
a
blizzard
of
cases
on
it,
on
either
side--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--let's
address
ruffalo
and
raley,
when
counsel
comes
in
prepared
to
do
one
thing
and,
in
fact,
after
that's
done
something
else
occurs
without
notice
to
them
about
what's
going
to
occur
in
the
case.
ruffalo
is
a
disbarment
case,
where
after
someone
testifies
another
charge
arises,
and
raley
is
the
fifth
amendment
case,
where
counsel...
where
people
are
told...
at
the
un-american
activities
investigation
in
ohio,
people
are
told,
you
know,
you
don't
have
to
say
anything,
and
you
can
take
your
fifth
amendment
right.
they
say,
great,
and
they
do,
and
then
they're
charged
with
a
violation
of
state
law.
that's
not
even
intentional
misleading.
that
was
just
a
mistake.
in
both
cases
it's
just
a
mistake
that
misled
counsel.
in
this
case,
if
it's
just
a
mistake,
then
there
we
are
with
raley
and
ruffalo,
but
it
wasn't
just
a
mistake,
according
to
the
district
court
in
this
case.
it
was
intentional,
it
was
immoral,
and
it
violated
standards
of
fair
play.
it
disarmed
defense
counsel,
and
it
was
prejudicial.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
the
best
phrase
for
that
is
at
page
350
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
the
prosecutor
"planned
to
violate
his
direct
promise.
"
and
the
district
court
then
drops
a
footnote,
note
4,
which
says
that
detective
slezak,
when
he
testified,
indicated
that
30
days
before...
and
he
says
somewhere
beyond
a
week,
some
days,
maybe
up
to
30
days
before,
he
met
with
ferguson
and
knew
he
would
be
at
the
sentencing
phase.
and
so
if
that's
true,
then
for
counsel
to
say
to
the
court,
and
to
defense
on
monday,
there
will
be
no
slezak...
he
didn't
say
that,
but--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--the
record
aside,
sir,
at
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--yes,
your
honor.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
the
respondent
has
not
contended
that
the
request
or
lack
of
a
request
expressly
for
a
continuance,
or
the
failure
to
have
developed
any
information
about
the
sorrells
crime
after
sentencing,
or
before
sentencing,
after
the
jury
verdict,
constitutes
an
adequate
and
independent
state
court
ground
for
this
court
to
observe,
because
there
are
no
cases
that
so
state.
there
is
no
virginia
case
that
says,
if
you
want
this
sort
of
evidence
to
be
excluded,
or
you
want
more
time
in
order
to
address
this
evidence,
you
have
to
move
for
a
continuance
instead
of
moving
for
exclusion.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
pardon?
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
cas.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
don't
recall.
i
do
recall
that
there
has
never
been
any
contention
by
respondent
that
there
is
any
requirement
in
the
state
of
virginia
that
a
person
do
this,
these
things,
in
order
to
avoid
a
bar.
there
are
no
such
cases.
and
i
would
like
to
address
justice
kennedy's
earlier
question
about
tactics
and
strategy.
defense
counsel
testified
below,
and
they
testified
that
they
were
blown
away
by
this,
and
that
they
wanted...
i
can't
quote
that
they
said,
we
wanted
a
continuance,
but
certainly
the
spirit
of
their
testimony,
and
i
can't
call
it
all,
bring
it
all
to
mind
at
this
point,
was
that
they
needed
time,
and
this
was
not
a
trick
or
a
strategy
on
their
part,
and
they
went
into
great
detail
about
how
devastating
this
was
to
them.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
well--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--i
think...
no.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
know
what
that
says,
and
i
think
that
that
was
hyperbole
about
how
devastating
the
case
was
about
sorrells.
if
you
read
the
newspapers,
that
case
is
a
devastating
case,
and
i
think
that
that
is
hyperbole.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
absolutely.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
i
think
that--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--they
wanted
it
excluded,
but
if
they
had
the
evidence
that
was
unearthed
in
the
federal
district
court,
it
would
have
been
a
powerful
tool
against
it.
it
was
a
devastating
case
only
because
their
hands
were
tied
with
respect
to--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--at
the
time
of
this
trial,
there
was
no
threshold.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
no,
and
now
there's
no
threshold,
but
there
is
a
notice
requirement.
you
don't
have
to
have
a
certain
quantum
of
proof.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
e.
olive
yes,
your
honor.
finally,
let
me
go
back
again
to
the
issue
of
what
the
law
is
in
the
commonwealth,
and
that
stating
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
address
this
is
not
a
grounds
for
excluding
it,
and
so
a
remedy
would
not
be
a
continuance.
counsel
stated
at
page
723,
we
are
not
prepared
for
any
of
this,
other
than
that
he
may
have
made
some
incriminating
statements.
that
is
what
you
told
us
on
monday.
we
come
in,
we're
prepared,
we
don't
want
a
continuance
on
that,
but
this
new
information,
we
are
not
prepared,
and
the
judge
presiding
said,
i
think
it's
admissible,
prepared
or
not
prepared,
and
so--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--no,
but--
mr.
mark
e.
olive
--well,
if
i'm
speaking
to...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
