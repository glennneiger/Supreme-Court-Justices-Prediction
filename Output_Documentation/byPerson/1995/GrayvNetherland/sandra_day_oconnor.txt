but
the--
--on
this
same
line,
it
appeared
to
me,
reading
the
fourth
circuit
opinion,
that
the
ca4
was
just
dealing
with
the
claim
and
with
the
district
court's
holding
that
your
client
was
entitled
to
notice
of
all
of
the
sentencing
evidence
that
was
to
be
used.
that
seemed
to
be
what
the
ca4
dealt
with
and
what
the
district
court
dealt
with.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
the
constitutional
defect
in
the
penalty
phase
hearing
was
that
gray
was
confronted
and
surprised.
it
violated
gray's
right
to
fair
notice
and
rendered
the
hearing
unreliable.
now,
the
district
court
went
on
to
talk
about
the
prosecutor's
tactics,
but
in
its
description
of
what
the
constitutional
violation
was,
it
was
a
violation
of
the
right
to
fair
notice,
and
that
seemed
to
be
what
the
fourth
circuit
dealt
with,
certainly,
in
its
opinion.
so
it
does
appear
that
the
present
focus
of
your
argument
before
this
court
is
somewhat
different,
namely,
before
us
a
focus
on
whether
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
rely
on
the
avowal
of
the
prosecutor
that
all
that
would
be
introduced
were
the
defendant's
statements,
and
because
of
that,
find
a
due
process
violation,
and
that
does
seem
to
be
something
that
was
not
the
subject
of
the
holdings
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it
described
the
constitutional
violation
as
the
violation
of
lack
of
fair
notice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
finding
were...
and
you
may
dispute
this,
but
if
the
finding
were
that
the
prosecutor
intentionally
misled
defense
counsel
as
to
what
evidence
he
intended
to
use,
and
that
that
misleading
was
important
in
the
preparation
of
the
defense
and
was
relied
upon
by
the
defense,
that
wouldn't
be
a
new
rule,
would
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
he
says
it's
that
plus
a
lack
of
notice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
tries
to
say,
i
have
both
here.
