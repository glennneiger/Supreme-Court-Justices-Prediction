chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-6510,
coleman
wayne
gray
v.
j.
d.
netherland.
mr.
olive.
mr.
olive,
the
respondents
contend
that
the
points
you're
raising
here
were
never
really
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
sometime
during
your
argument,
would
you
address
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
motion
for
a
continuance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
answer
that
question
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
be
clear,
perhaps,
if
you
had
moved
for
a
continuance,
but
i
don't
know
that
the
trial
court
is
required
by
the
federal
constitution
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
an
attorney
who
makes
these
statements
but
doesn't
move
for
a
continuance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
argue
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
that
your
motions
or
comments
at
this
point
in
the
trial
were
tantamount
to
a
request
for
a
continuance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you...
so
you
didn't
argue...
you
didn't
argue
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
that
the
trial
court
should
have
granted
you
a
continuance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
with
respect
to
your
statement
that
the
prosecutor
made
a
certain
avowal,
i'm
going
to
offer
this
and
this
only
with
respect
to
this
aspect,
ordinarily
there's
not
much
discovery
in
a
criminal
case
in
virginia,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
i
mean,
was
the
prosecutor
vouchsafing
something
to
you
that
he
was
not
required
to
do
by
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
that
that
case
is
the
preferred
approach,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the...
what
did
the
district
court
do
in
order
to
conclude
that
it
was
intentional?
you
say
the
district
court
actually
found
that
it
was
intentional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't
sound
quite
like
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
intentional
misrepresentation.
you
say
it
is.
we
can
all
look
at
the
record
and
find
out,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
hold
a
hearing,
to
hear
witnesses?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
olive.
mr.
mclees,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the--
--you
could...
i
take
it
you
could
reasonably
read
the
district
judge's
opinion
as
not
being
based
on
deliberate
misconduct.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
he
could
have
given
him
3
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--very
well,
mr.
mclees.
mr.
olive,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
