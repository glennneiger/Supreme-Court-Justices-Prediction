justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
or
any
other
series
of
arguments
addressing
this
point
developed
in
the
virginia
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
whether
you
were
derelict,
or
trial
counsel
was
derelict
in
failing
exclusively
to
ask
for
a
continuance.
justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
developed?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
i
thought
your
claim
in
the
first
instance,
at
the
trial
court,
before
you
learned
about
the
prosecutor's
state
of
knowledge
and
intentions,
was
that
the
prosecutor
had
made
a
representation
about
what
would
be
offered,
you
relied
on
the
representation,
and
you
were
not
prepared
to
meet
anything
else.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
a...
i...
isn't
it
fairly...
i
mean,
i'm
handing
you
this,
i
know,
but
i
want
to
get
your
response
to
it.
isn't
your
claim
a
reliance
claim,
a
detrimental
reliance
claim,
rather
than
an
affirmative
right
to
notice
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
were
misled,
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you...
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
a
previous
question,
you
concede
that
under
virginia
law,
if
you
had
said,
i
want
to
know
what
the
evidence
is,
and
the
prosecutor
had
said,
i
won't
tell
you,
that
you
would
have
no
claim
under...
for
a
violation
of
virginia
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
have
a
claim...
would
you
have
a
constitutional
claim
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
in
fact
not
the
claim
that
you're
making,
i
take
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
i'm
sorry.
no,
go
on.
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
the
proceeding.
the
proceeding
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
the
entire
trial,
it's
the
sentencing,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
your
claim
is
that
assuming
there
was
an
intent
to
mislead,
that
it
was
important,
as
justice
o'connor
put
it,
to
the
preparation
by
the
defense
to
meet
the
issues
raised
at
sentencing,
that
that
would
not
infect
the
fairness
of
the
entire
proceeding,
sentencing
proceeding?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
i
understand
you
correctly?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
concede
that
he
did
say,
we
are
not
prepared?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i--
--did
you
argue
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
he
had
failed
to
preserve
the
issue
of
its
unfairness
because
of
misleading,
and
that
therefore
you
were
entitled
to
prevail
on
that
ground?
was
that
your
position
in
either
the
district
court
or
the
fourth
circuit?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
judge...
at
least
there
is
a
way
of
reading
the
judge's...
and
i
think
perhaps
a
fair
way
of
reading
the
district
judge's
findings
as
a
finding
of
misleading,
so
let's
get
to
the
fourth
circuit.
did
you
argue
in
the
fourth
circuit
that
that
was,
in
fact,
not
a
permissible
ground
for
decision
because
he
had
not
preserved
that
issue
in
the
state
courts?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i'm
just
talking
now
about
the
issues
that
he
raised,
and
are
you
telling
me
that
in
the
fourth
circuit
you
said
he
did
not
preserve
the
issue
of
affirmative
misleading?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
he
waived
any
claim
because
he
did
not
ask
for
a
continuance.
did
you
argue
those
two
points
in
the
fourth
circuit?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
were
you
saying
in
the
fourth
circuit,
you
cannot
sustain
the
district
court's
decision
based
on
a
finding
that
there
was
intentional
misleading
because
a)
he
did
not
make
a
finding
of
misleading
conduct
as
opposed
to
a
notice
claim
in
the
state
courts,
and
b)
he
did
not
ask
for
a
continuance,
and
therefore
waived
any
claim
that
he
had?
did
you
argue
either
of
those
two
points
as
a
bar
to
relief
when
you
got
to
your
appeal
in
the
fourth
circuit?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
could
have
done
so,
but
what
reason
would
they
have
done
so
if
their
understanding
was
that
the
only
thing
they
had
to
do
was
to
discredit
a
snitch?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
they
only
prepared
for
the
dynamite
that
they
understood
they
were
going
to
be
exposed
to,
and
there
was
no
reason
that
i
know
of
on
the
record
why
they
would
have
been...
why
they
would
have
prepared
for
any
other
dynamite.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
think
this
goes
back
to
something
that
was
raised
before.
you
have
never
claimed,
i
think,
that
they
are
barred
from
making
the
argument
they
make
now
because
in
the
period
after
trial
they
did
not
go
into...
they
did
not
make
an
investigation
and
come
forward
with
evidence
that
they
would
have
presented.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
in
your
brief
in
opposition?
because
i
mean,
if
that's
the
case,
and
that
amounts
to
a
waiver
under
virginia
law,
and
that
was
preserved,
then
we
certainly
shouldn't
have
taken
this
case,
but
i...
i
don't
have
the
brief
in
opposition
in
front
of
me,
but
i
didn't
think
you
made
that
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
think
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
this
court
you
said,
they
are
barred
because
they
did
not
make
an
investigation
in
the
2-week
or
2-month
period,
whatever
it
is,
after
the
trial,
and
come
forward
with
a
proffer
of
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
you
agree
that
if
you
didn't
make
it
in
your
brief
in
opposition,
that
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
subject
for
us
to
get
into
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
you
in
effect,
then,
are
saying
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
made
a
fundamental
fairness
judgment
based
upon
evidence
which
the
defendant
had
no
reason,
based
on
the
prosecutor's
representation,
to
have
been
prepared
to
present
to
the
trial
judge,
and
therefore
the...
in
effect,
the...
any
ruling
by
the
trial
court
will
either
stand
or
fall
depending
on
what
is
developed
after
trial.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
in
state
habeas?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
again,
if
you
did
not
raise
that
in
your
brief
in
opposition,
it
seems
to
me
you're
raising
a
matter
which
goes
to
a
procedural
bar,
and
if
you
didn't
raise
it
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
i'm
not
sure
why
we
should
get
into
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
let
us...
in
effect,
if
you
didn't
get
into
this
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
you
let
us
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
wasn't
this
kind
of
prejudice-bar
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
feel
we
should
be
deciding
that
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
feel
that
that
is
a
decision
that
we
should
make
as
to
whether,
in
fact,
it
would
constitute
a
bar,
or
wouldn't
constitute
a
bar?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
was
it...
you
may
recall
my
question,
my
last
question
to
counsel
which
adverted
specifically
to
the
obligation
to
investigate
for
post
trial
relief.
was
that
issue
raised
as
a
basis
for
a
bar
in
the
brief
in
opposition?
