chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-1244,
john
w.
behrens
v.
robert
pelletier.
mr.
weiss,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
many
times
is
a
district
court
expected
to
entertain
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
same
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
question
arises
when
there's
been
an
appeal
from
a
motion...
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
then
the
second
time
around
on
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
weiss.
ms.
pillard,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pillard.
mr.
rees,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
response
to
the
solicitor
general's
example,
where
the
appeal
from
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
pleadings
say
a
plus
b
plus
c
facts
occur,
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
that's
a
violation
of
a
clearly
established
rule,
discovery,
and
after
discovery,
it's
clear
that
c
cannot
be
proven,
so
that
only
a
plus
b
exists.
can
that
go
again
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
so
if
the
district
court
properly
structures
so
that
you
only
have
one...
you
know,
if
you
only
allowed
one
motion
for
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
speak
generally,
if
you
would.
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
take
my
hypothesis
that
the
district
court
does
structure
the
thing.
you
have
a
motion
to
dismiss.
you're
allowed
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
beginning.
the
district
court
rules
on
it.
then
a
certain
period
of
time
for
discovery,
and
then
motions
for
summary
judgment,
now
or
never
after
discovery,
and
the
issue
on
the
second
appeal
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
only
a
plus
b
can
be
proven.
c
cannot
be
proven.
the
first
time
you
ruled
a
plus
b
plus
c
was
enough.
now
you
have
a
different
issue,
is
a
plus
b
enough.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
not
at
all
sure
the
district
court
has
to
indulge
all
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
weiss,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
94-1244,
behrens
against
pelletier
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
