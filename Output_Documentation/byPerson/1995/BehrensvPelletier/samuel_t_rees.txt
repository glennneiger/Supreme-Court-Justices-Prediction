mr.
samuel
t.
rees
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
my
argument
today,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
one
interlocutory
appeal
rule
of
the
first,
seventh,
and
ninth
circuits
as
the
correct
application
of
1291,
a
correct
application
of
cohen
v.
beneficial
industrial
loan,
a
correct
application
of
mitchell
v.
forsyth,
more
importantly
a
correct
balancing
of
the
interests
of
both
the
governmental
defendants
and
the
plaintiffs
and
the
judicial
system
which
this
court
went
through
in
its
analysis
of
mitchell
in
the
first
instance--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--justice--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--excuse
me
for
interrupting.
justice
scalia,
when
this
court
analyzed
this
issue
originally
in
mitchell
and
granted
collateral
order
status
in
mitchell,
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
did
so
is
because
of
the
three-prong
cohen
test
and
because,
as
a
result
of
the
determination
in
mitchell,
as
a
separate
issue
it
was
going
to
decide
conclusively
an
issue,
and
it
was
going
to
do
so
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
have
been
unreviewable
after
a
trial.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
in
this
situation,
in
the
present
case
before
you,
and
i
would
submit
in
virtually
every
instance
except
the
extreme
instance,
where
there
is
a
second
interlocutory
appeal,
if
you
are
not
reexamining
for
a
second
time
before
a
second
panel
an
issue
already
decided
by
the
first
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals,
you
are
of
necessity
not
going
to
do
away
with
the
trial.
at
best,
all
you
are
going
to
do
is
reduce
the
scope
of
the
issues
that
are
actually
going
to
be
tried
in
the
trial,
and
that's
not
what
this
court
originally
did
in
its
analysis
of
mitchell.
more
importantly,
when
this--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--okay.
i
apologize.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
if
the--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--in
mitchell...
well,
the
court's...
this
court
has
never
specifically
dealt
with
that
issue,
but
with
regard
to
the
civil
rights
claim,
let's
assume
that
there
are
no
claims
other
than
bivens-type
civil
rights
claim,
and
we
handle
the
problem,
i
think,
with
the
district
court
putting
all
of
the
claims
together
so
that
they
all
come
up
on
appeal
at
the
same
time.
i
think
that's
a
sensible
situation.
but
having
had
a
first
appeal
where
the
court
has
determined
that
clearly
established
rights
were
violated
and
the
defendant
would
reasonably...
a
person
in
the
defendant's
position
would
reasonably
understand
that
they
violated
clearly--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--the--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--no.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
that's
true.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
if
those
facts
are
proven
at
trial.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
but
it
also
examined
a
clearly
established
right
as
well,
justice
souter.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
certainly,
and
it
examined
both
the
substantive
and
the
procedural
due
process
claim,
which
are
the
two
claims
that
were
being
brought.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
and
that's
supposed
to
be
the
point
that
every
qualified
immunity
appeal
is
supposed
to
turn
on
if
we
are
dealing
with
the
purely
legal
issue
as
opposed
to
the
fact-determinative
issues
that
the
court--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--well,
i
handle
that
issue
several
different
ways.
first
of
all,
that
was
an
error
that
was
created
by
mr.
behrens,
invited
by
the
district
court,
which
mr.
behrens
recognized
and
put
in
his
first
appeal
brief
when
he
argued
in
his
first
appeal
brief
precisely
the
issue
that
he
wants
to
raise
on
the
second
appeal.
he
did
argue
it.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
not
to
reach
it,
and
fortunately
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
footnote
indicated
that
the
district
court
was
in
error
in
its
statute
of
limitations
determination,
something
that
the
plaintiff
was
unable
to
raise
in
an
interlocutory
appeal.
so
in
this...
this
happens
to
be
a
situation
where
that
error
was
in
fact
invited,
but
in
point
and
view,
there
is
going
to
be
a
trial,
and
if
mr.
behrens
loses
in
that
trial,
he
does
have
the
opportunity
to
get
an
appellate
determination.
it
just
happens
to
be
a
post
trial
determination.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
in
mitchell,
the
court
went
that
far.
this
court
has
never
gone
so
far
as
to
say
it
must
entirely
omit
the
trial,
but--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--it
clearly
supports
a
one-appeal
theory.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
i
apologize.
excuse
me
for
interrupting.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that,
justice
souter.
i'm
talking
about
with
regard
to
the
civil
rights
claims.
there
have
been
some
instances
where
there
are--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--certainly.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
i'm
saying--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--i'm
saying
that
the
district
court--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--it--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--i
understand
what
you're
driving
at,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
at
the
point
in
time
that
there
is
a
conclusive
determination
of
the
issue,
then
that
is
the
time
when
the
qualified
immunity
purely
legal
issue
is
ripe
for
appeal.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
it
may
be
that
it's
ripe
for
appeal
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
at
the
later
stage.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
that
did
not
happen
here.
it
essentially
happens
here
now
because
the
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
has
given
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
make
that
decision,
because
understand
that
the
issue
got
raised
in
this
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
because
we
argued
that
there
was
not
jurisdiction
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
i
would
assert,
your
honor,
that
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
as
soon
as
you
do,
a
plus
b
plus
c
gets
another
appeal.
then
you
must
do
a
plus
b
plus
c
plus
d.--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--in
this
case,
when
the
case--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--okay,
but
i
thought
this
case
would
be
instructive
on
that
issue,
because
when
the
case
came
back
down
from
the
court
of
appeal,
after
the
first
appeal,
the
defendant
took
some
more
discovery
so
that
the
defendant
could
raise
a
slightly
different
issue
with
regard
to
their
claim
for
a
second
interlocutory--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--and
then
on
the
motions
in
limine
you
have
a,
the
change
in
a,
and
a
can't
be
proven.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
clearly
the
district
court
will
analyze
the
case
under
motions
in
limine,
clearly
at
the
time
of
the
pretrial
conference
order
if
not
on
the
eve
of
trial.
the
case
be...
continues
in
flux
from
a
factual
point
of
view,
all
the
way
up
to
the
end,
when
the
jury
comes
back--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--and
clearly
a
rule,
justice
souter--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--yes.
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
no.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
that
is
one
of
the
benefits,
justice
souter,
of
the
district
court's
ability
to
fashion
the
pretrial
proceedings
to
structure
the
qualified
immunity
issues,
even
insofar
as
their
appeal,
so
that
that
issue
can
be
raised
and
conclusively
determined
so
that
a
single
appeal--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--it's
a
practical--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--it's
clearly
a
practical
way
for
the
district
court
to
attempt
to
destroy--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--assuming
there's
no
mandate
issued
from
the
circuit
court
when
the
defendant
said--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--i'm
entitled
to
have
a
decision.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
it
would--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--the
qualified
immunity...
it
would
destroy
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
completely
avoid
discovery.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
on
the
basis
of
qualified
immunity.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
you--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--yes,
and
you
will
destroy
that
discovery
protection
by
the
defendant's
own
choosing.
that
is,
the
defendant
will
be
in
the
best
position
to
decide
when
he
wants
to
have
that
issue
tested.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
it
is
clearly
a
requirement
of
cohen.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
it
is
not...
it
is
not
satisfied.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
there
is
also
the
price,
justice
scalia,
on
the
other
side,
which
is
from
the
multiple
interlocutory
appeal
and
the
delay--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--if
you
are
going
to
fashion
a
rule
that
allows
for
two
appeals
of
the
issue,
and
you're
going
to
attempt
not
to
have
the
forum-shopping
within
the
circuit
of
one
panel
says
yes
and
another
panel
says
no
because
you're
having
the
same
issue
reviewed
a
second
time.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
well,
not
only
does
it
lead
to
the
potential,
i
think
it
leads
to
the
absolute
conclusion--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--it
is
clearly...
from
a
balancing
point
of
view,
it
is
an
unsatisfactory--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--in
the
majority
of
cases
it
will
result
in
only
two
appeals,
but
it
will
also
result
in
almost
every
case
in
two
appeals,
because
it
is
clearly
in
the
defendant's
claimed
interest
to
delay
the
resolution
of
the
case
by
taking
the
two
appeals.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
i
believe
that--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--it
was
a
balancing
issue--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--that
was
done--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--as
well.
i
did
not
find
it
as
a
pure
constitutional--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--it
is
not.
it
is
a
not
a
pure
constitutional--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
in
order
to
create
a
two-appeal
rule
case,
because
that's,
i
thought,
where
your
hypothetical
led
us
to,
a
two-appeal,
one
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
one
at
summary
judgment,
i
think
you've
expanded
your
appellate
jurisdiction,
the
appellate
jurisdiction
that
you've
created
in
mitchell,
and
mitchell
was
a
close
case
to
begin
with.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
because--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--if
avoiding
discovery
is
a
separate
cognizable
interest
that
under
cohen
is
sufficiently
important
to
view
as
a
need
for
a
single,
interlocutory
appeal,
then
you
are
correct.
then
you
are
looking
at
qualified
immunity
avoidance
of
discovery,
qualified
immunity
avoidance
of
trial.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
we
recog...
i'm
sorry.
this
court
recognized
the
qualified
immunity
issue
the
first
time
and
allowed
an
interlocutory
appeal
as
an
exception
under
cohen
because
after
balancing
those
issues
they
thought
it
was
important
not
only
because
of
the
defendant's
right
to
avoid
discovery,
but
also
the
defendant's
right
to
avoid
trial--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--and
it
was
a
single
appeal
issue.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
we
do
not
disagree
with
the
court's
power
to
fashion
a
rule
which
allows
the
escape
route
for
the
exceptional
case,
be
it
under
the
rule-making
power,
be
it
under
1292(b),
be
it
under
the
power
that
says,
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances
there's
only
one
appeal,
because
one
appeal
will
resolve
the
purely
legal
issue
and
protect
the
rights
of
the
governmental
defendant
to
avoid
both
discovery
and
trial
while
at
the
same
time
protecting
the
interests
of
the
plaintiffs
and
the
judicial
system,
because
every
time
there
is
an
appeal,
there
is
a
cost
in
this
system,
and
there
is
the
cost
of
the
system
of
taking
these
seriatim
appeals.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
after
the
fact.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
well,
it
doesn't
help
the
plaintiff,
and
i
think
if...
justice
scalia,
if
you
take
just
a
brief
look
at
this
case,
where
after
7
years
we're
still
not
up
to
an
appeal...
or,
a
trial,
and
we've
still
only
done
one
interlocutory
appeal,
and
the
entire
governmental
agency
that
was
involved
has
been
abolished,
all
the
witnesses
have
scattered
to
the
four
winds--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--it
does
not
always
go
back
to
the
same
judge.
it
frequently
goes,
and
is
usually
the
case
that
it
will
come
back
to
the
same
judge.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
i'm
afraid
so,
with
this
judge.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
well,
we
started
with
1291,
which
is
the
rule
that
we
are
interpreting.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
yes.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
yes.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
and
i've
said,
i
believe
that
it
is
perfectly
permissible
to
utilize
the
rule-making
authority
to
handle
the
problems
with
the
exceptional
case
and
give
the
governmental
defendant
who
has
a
legitimate
claim
for
a
second
interlocutory
appeal
that
opportunity,
and
i
think
it
can
be
done
under
rule-making,
i
think
it
can
be
done
under
case
interpretation,
just
the
same
way
mitchell
allowed
the
interlocutory
appeal
in
the
first
instance,
and
i
think
it
can...
the
escape
valve
is
there--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--well,
i
mean,
we
would
argue
that
it's
not
because
it's
actually
the
stronger
of
the
cases
that
wasn't
ruled
upon,
but
not
only
that,
i
mean,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
it's
not
going
to
conclusively
determine
that
issue,
because
mr.
behrens
will
still
go
to
trial
on
the
substantive
and
procedural
due
process
claims
that
we
have
done
for
violation
of
mr.
pelletier's
liberty
interests.
he
will
go
to
trial
with
regard
to
that.
at
best,
the
only
thing
that
the
second
appeal
is
going
to
do
is
reduce
the
scope
of
the
issues
to
be
tried,
and
probably
not
do
that
terribly
effectively.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
well,
under
this
court's
reasoning,
as
this
court
did
it
in
johnson
and
in
mitchell
and
in
cohen,
and
in
digital--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--no.
i
think
if
you
are...
if
you
are
conclusively
determining
the
qualified
issue
with
regard
to
that
action--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--well,
we're
not
allowed
to
take
the
other
side
of
the
appeal.
we're
not
allowed...
the
plaintiff's
not
allowed
to
take
the
statute
of
limitations,
or
the
administrative
procedure
act,
or
any
of
the
other
claims
where
there's
been
a
determination,
but--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--i
could
have
asked
for
a
1292(b)
discretionary
appeal
with
regard--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--yes.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
yes.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
oh,
no,
because
that
really
cut
across
all
the
lines
of
the
case.
it
didn't
finally
dispose
of
the
issue
sufficiently
enough--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--no.
no,
your
honor.
that
was
a
misstatement
by
mr.
weiss,
i
believe.
the
actual
claims
here
are
substantive...
a
substantive
due
process
claim
and
a
procedural
due
process
claim,
both
of
which
claims
asserted
both
a
liberty
and
property
interest.
the
only
thing
that
happened
with
regard
to
the
district
court,
as
the
district
court
said,
with
regard
to
your
substantive
claim,
you
cannot
raise
that
on
the
writing
of
the
behrens
directive.
you
must
work
on
a
1-year
statute.
you
can
only
go
back
1
year
from
the
date
of
the
suit,
rather
than
3
years.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
that's
not
my
argument,
justice
scalia.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
i
must
have
misspoken--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is,
at
the
point
in
time
of
the
appeal,
the
appeal
should
resolve
conclusively
the
qualified
immunity
issues
the
defendant
wishes
to
raise.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
so
that
we
don't
go
in
seriatim.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
no,
because
he
will
take
it
up,
all
of
those
claims--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--that
he
has
been
denied
his--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--qualified
immunity
rights.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
well,
i
would
assert
that
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far,
and
you
certainly
don't
need
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
this
is
a
case...
this
is
a
case,
if
you
remember
back
to
mitchell
when
qualified
immunity
appeals--
mr.
samuel
t.
rees
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
