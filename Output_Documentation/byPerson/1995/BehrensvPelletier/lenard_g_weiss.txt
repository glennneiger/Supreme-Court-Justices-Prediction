mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is,
can
the
court
of
appeals
refuse,
on
jurisdictional
grounds,
to
hear
an
interlocutory,
qualified
immunity
appeal
solely
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
the
second
such
appeal?
there
are
two
bivens
claims
pleaded
in
this
case
before
the
court,
one,
a
job
termination
claim
that
the
plaintiff
says
he
has
a
constitutionally
protected
property
interest
in
his
contingent
employment
with
pioneer
savings
and
loan,
and
was
deprived
of
due
process
when
that...
when
pioneer
terminated
him,
and
the
second
claim
is
that
he
had
a
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interest
in
pursuing
other
employment
in
the
financial
services
industry
which
was
impaired
by
the
stigmatizing
circumstances
of
his
departure
from
pioneer.
on
the
first
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
following
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
prior
to
discovery,
the
ninth
circuit
did
three
things:
it
announced
its
categorical
one-appeal
jurisdictional
rule,
it
affirmed
the
district
court's
denial
of
qualified
immunity
as
to
the
job
search
claim,
the
first
claim,
and
it
revived
a
previously
dismissed
job
termination
claim.
excuse
me,
i
may
have
misspoken.
it
affirmed
the
job
search
finding
by
the
lower
court
and
revived
the
job
termination
claim,
which
had
been
dismissed
on
a
statute
of
limitations
basis.
on
remand,
after
full
discovery,
petitioner
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
his
qualified
immunity
defense
to
the
bivens
claims,
and
that
motion
was
denied
on
both
claims.
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
dismissed
petitioner's
second
interlocutory
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
solely
on
the
basis
of
its
previously
announced
one-appeal
rule.
i
would
like
to
make
several
points.
first,
this
case
fits
squarely
within
the
appealable
orders
criteria
of
the
mitchell
case.
second,
the
one-appeal
rule
effectively
emasculates
the
qualified
immunity
as
immunity
from
suit,
pretrial
and
litigation
burdens
of
suit.
thirds,
the
concerns
over
abuse
and
judicial
economy
are
misplaced.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
normally,
i...
normally
a
summary
judgment
motion
in
the
same
case
will
only
occur
on
one
occasion,
and
normally
the
district
courts
that
i
practice
in
front
of
are
very
careful
about
scheduling
when
summary
judgment
will
occur
and
will
not
occur.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
precisely,
and
usually
it
comes
up
in
the
context
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
because
the
question
is
whether
the
law
is
settled
or
not,
and
sometimes
that
is
a
relatively
easy
question
to
answer.
perhaps
it
would
have
been
in
this
case.
we
would
have
thought
so.
if
it
does...
if
that's
not
clear,
then
you
have
to
go
through
some
discovery,
at
least,
and
go
through
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
stage.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
a
question
i'm
not
certain
of
the
answer,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
the
court
must
respond
to
the
motion
to
dismiss.
it
is
an
attack
on
the
pleadings--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--prediscovery.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
certainly
in
the
context
of
qualified
immunity--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--which
this
court
seems
to
have
made
clear
is
an
important
remedy
or
defense,
and
a
protection
from
the
rigors
of
litigation,
of
which
discovery
is
the
worst,
perhaps.
turning
to
my
first
point,
if
this
case
were
the...
if
this
were
the
first
interlocutory
appeal
in
this
case,
it
would
clearly
be...
it
would
fit
squarely
within
the
category
of
appealable
orders
described
by
this
court
in
mitchell
and
in
cohen,
so
if
this
were
the
first
appeal,
no
question
in
our
view--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--under
1291,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
a
variant
on
that--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--yes.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
you
always
have--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--well,
as
this
court
probably
well
knows,
it
is
very
unusual
for
1292(b)
certifications
(a)
to
occur
at
the
district
court,
and
even
far
rarer
for
them
to
occur
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
both
courts
have
to
exercise
their
discretion,
and
in
one
of
the
articles
we
cited
by
professor
solemini,
he
points
out,
i
believe,
that
something
less
than
5
percent
of
the
cases
in
which
the
district
court
actually
certifies,
less
than
5
percent
of
those
are
actually
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
so
it's
not
a
very
practical--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--sure.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
which
is
also
one
of
the
underlying
philosophies
behind
the
cohen
rule
and
its
application
in
qualified
immunity
cases.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
well,
he's
wrong
because
as
a
matter
of
law
the
court
has
found
that
the
law
is
settled
or
unsettled.
that's
the
only
issue
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
following
discovery,
the
issue
turns
as
to
whether
or
not
the
behavior
of
the
government
defendant
was
reasonable
behavior
in
light
of
that
settled
law.
it's
a
different
issue
after--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--well,
but
the
thing
he's
trying
is
a
different
thing.
he's
trying
a
different
issue
on
the
second
appeal,
because--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--it's--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--well,
of
course,
it
is
if
you...
if
your
first
appeal
is
following
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
pleadings
and
you're
dealing
only
with
the
pleadings,
you
now
have
a
developed
record,
and
in
this
case
there
are...
several
facts
emerge
from
the
record--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--i
think
that's
purely
theoretical.
it's
not...
the
only
thing--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--well,
the
only
thing
that's
appealable
on
the
second
qualified
immunity
appeal
is
whether
or
not
the
behavior
of
the
government
defendant
was
objectively
reasonable
or
not,
given
the
settled
law.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
well,
in
the
johnson
case,
the
facts
were
heavily
disputed.
the
law--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--correct.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
i
think
the
rather...
i
think
the
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
district
court
is
going
to
say...
and
they
all
do
this,
as
i'm
familiar...
on
60...
or
6
months
from
now
in
a
scheduling
order,
we
will
have
motions
for
summary
judgment,
period,
thirty
days
from
now
we'll
have
motions
to
dismiss,
and
in
between
we'll
have
discovery.
and
that's
the
way
this
is
handled
in
any
court,
and...
so
that
the
problem,
while
i
understand
there's
a
theoretical
issue,
there
could
be--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--well,
i--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--if--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--right.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
well,
it
is--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--in
this
case--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--exactly.
in
this
case,
as
an
example,
concerted
action
by
defendants
is
alleged
in
the
complaint.
after
discovery
is
completed...
completed
in
this
case,
the
only
evidence
of
any
kind
of
concerted
action
is
a
unilateral
sending
of
mr.
behrens'
letter
to
his
file
and
to
his--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--well--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--not
at
all.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
in
the
first
instance,
the
court
found...
improperly,
we
think,
but
found
that
there
was
settled
law
here.
there--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--yes.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
correct.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
they
are
derivative,
one
of
the
other.
the
underlying
issue
was
a
resolution
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
that
said
this
savings
and
loan
was
required
to
hire
a
principal
operating
officer
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
supervising
agent.
there
followed
from
that
the
hiring
of
mr.
pelletier.
there
followed
from
that
mr.
behrens'
letter
saying
that
he
ought
to
step
aside
pending
an
investigation
that
was
underway
for
mr.
pelletier's
previous
employer,
beverly
hills
savings,
which
had
gone
under
at
that
point.
so
then
mr.
behrens'
says,
you've
caused
me
to
be
fired.
that's
a
job
loss,
suing
for
due
process
violations
there,
and
in
addition,
because
people
learned
of
the
circumstances
of
my
departure,
i've
also
had
my
reputation
stigmatized
by
that
fact,
and
i'm
entitled
to
a
liberty
interest
in
that
reputation.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
right.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
in
a
right
not
to
have
undue
governmental
interference
in
your
right
to
seek
employment
in
your
chosen
field.
that's
about
what
it
says,
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
could
tell
you
much
more.
i
assume
it's
a
due
process--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--correct.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
that's
what
the--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--that's
correct.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
no,
that's
more
expressly
stated
in
the
pleadings
as
a
due
process
violation.
that
is,
i
had--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--i
had
a--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--i
had
a
property...
i
had
a
property
right
in
my
job.
you've
deprived
me
of
that
without
due
process.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
a
liberty
claim
in
reputation.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
that's
my
understanding
of
what
they're
pleading,
yes.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
correct.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
that's
correct.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
correct.
there
was
also
a
statute
of
limitations
argument
which
was
sustained
here.
that
issue--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--that
issue
has
never
been
on
appeal
on
the
question
of
qualified
immunity.
the
job
termination
claim,
because
it
was
dismissed
the
first
time
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds,
when
it
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
the
first
time,
the
ninth
circuit
said,
district
court,
i
think
there's
some
recent
law
that
changes
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
when
it
went
back
down
on
remand
after
the
first...
so
there
was
never
review
on
qualified
immunity
of
that
first
claim,
and
the
district
court--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--on
that
job
termination
claim.
it
was
decided...
it
was
decided
on
the
second
claim,
and
i
think
the
question
i
heard
from
justice
ginsburg,
and
what
you're
asking
is,
the
nexus
of
the
underlying
legal
issue
is
probably
the
same
on
both
of
those.
that
is,
one
is
derivative
from
the
other.
i
don't
think
you
could
have
a
loss
of
reputation
claim,
this
liberty
interest
claim,
without
first
having
had
the
job
termination
property
interest
claim.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
on
the
pleadings.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
your
question
assumed
that
there
would
be
an
appeal
from
the...
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage
on
the
pleadings,
followed
by
discovery,
followed
by
one--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--of
course.
i
was
trying...
i
was
struggling
with
that
answer
before.
the
trial
courts
do,
can
and
do
control
this
issue
very
well
now.
that's
why,
when
you
look
at
the
jurisprudence
in
the
courts
of
appeal
right
now
on
this
issue,
you
only
find
two
cases
where
there
are
actually
two
appeals
that
are
reported
cases,
mitchell
and
the
abel
case.
the
rest
of
those
cases
where
the
circuits
are
split,
or
who
have
spoken
on
the
subject
of
qualified
immunity,
multiple
appeals,
were
not
actually
two-appeal
cases.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
--i
think
that
is
correct.
there
is
the
potential,
i
think,
and
it's
not
before
the
court
in
this
case,
that
you
could
have
a
separate
issue
on
westfall,
or
a
separate...
double
jeopardy's
not
going
to
happen,
but
there
is
a...
i
suppose
you
could
make
the
argument,
but
i
don't
think
it's
a...
it
certainly
has
not
come
up
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
at
all.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve,
if
i
may.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lenard
g.
weiss
petitioner
will
waive,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
