ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
one-appeal
rule
is
invalid.
as
this
case
shows,
there
are
clearly
situations
in
which
the
one-appeal
rule
makes
no
sense,
because
it
cuts
off
valid
qualified
immunity
defenses
even
when
they're
being
asserted
on
appeal
for
the
first
time.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
you
would
have
that
authority
if
you
engaged
in
notice
or
comment
rule-making
under
28
u.s.c.
2072.
we
would
be
opposed
to
such
a
rule.
we
don't
think
that...
we
think
that
that
cuts
directly
against
the
impetus
of
mitchell,
which
is
to
not
leave
within
the
district
court's
discretion
whether
to
allow
a
second
appeal.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
it
would
require
a
revision
of
the
mitchell
right,
that
component
of
the
qualified
immunity--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--nd
it
would
require
this
court
to
determine
whether
that
aspects
was
a
substantive
aspect
of
the
qualified
immunity,
that's
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
if
you
enacted
such
a
rule,
but
you
could
not...
it's
argued
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
course,
procedurally,
would
be
by
rule-making,
not
by
decision
in
a
case
such
as
this,
and
certainly
that
the
courts
of
appeals
lack
the
authority
to
cut
back
the
jurisdiction
that
they
now
have
under
mitchell
and
cohen
under
this
court's
interpretation
of
1291
in
mitchell
and
cohen,
that
that...
they
can't
contract
their
existing
statutory
jurisdiction
in
the
absence
of
the
extraordinary
measure
of
this
court
making
a
rule.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
we
think
that
if
it's
the
identical
argument--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that
would
be
barred.
the
basis
of
our
view
is
that
if
a
plaintiff
asserts
a
new
claim
or
a
new
legal
basis
for
an
existing
claim
and
a
district
court
denies
immunity
on
qualified
immunity
grounds
after
an
appeal
has
already
been
taken,
that
the
public
official
has
a
right
to
appeal
to
test
whether
the
new
claim
or
theory
is
based
on
clearly
established--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--my
response
is
that
the
court
would
have
to
at
least
go
through
that
process.
i'm
not
sure
this
court
has
the
power
to
cut
back--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that
broadly.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
exactly,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
be
taken
to
express
the
view
that
such
a
rule
would
actually
be
valid,
and
a
one-appeal
rule
would
actually
be
valid
because
it
would
not
cut
back
a
substantive
right.
it
might
well
cut
back
a
substantive
right.
but
the
issue
before
this
court
is
affected
by
the
existence
of
2072
merely
to
the
extent
it
indicates
it
shouldn't
be
done
in
this
forum.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
the
court
would
have
to
decide
whether
it
was
the
same--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--if
it's
the
same
claim,
though,
we
don't
think
that's
a
complex
inquiry.
the
court--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--ordinarily--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--ordinarily,
where
an
appeal
is
filed
and
the
court
of
appeals
lacks
jurisdiction,
you'll
see
a
motion
from
the
appellee
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
and
those
are
dealt
with
by
a
motion
panel.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
there
is
no
rigid
numerical
limit
on
the
number
of
appeals.
i
agree
with
mr.
weiss
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
structuring
of
the
litigation
in
the
district
court
is
going
to
lead
to
two,
at
most.
ordinarily
there
will
only
be
one,
if
that.
but
it's
the
order
of
the
district
court
that
gives
rise
to
the
opportunity
to
appeal,
and
if
the
district
court
refrains
from
ruling
on
a
summary
judgment
motion
until
the
claims
are
ripe
for
disposition
together,
that
can
organize
and
bracket
those
claims
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
limit
the
scenario
of
an
infinite
sequence
of
appeals.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
pardon?
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
in--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
think
it's
wholly
consistent
with
johnson,
because
the
issue
that
is
being
sought
to
be
raised
on
the
second
appeal
is...
under
our
rule
has
to
be
different
from
the
issue
to
be
raised
on
the
first
appeal.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--in
anderson
v.
creighton.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
well,
this
really...
i
may
have
created
some
confusion
on
this,
but
it
goes,
i
think,
to
the
issue
that
justice
souter
raised
about
whether,
because
the
immunity
right
is
a
substantive
right,
could
it
be
contracted,
the
right
to
appeal
denial,
be
contracted
by
rule-making?
we
certainly
think
that
that
would
be
the
procedure.
if
the
court
were
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
it's
not
a
substantive
right,
it
would
be
most
appropriately
done
by
rule,
but
i
also
don't
think
that
it
could
be
done
under
1292(e),
because
that
deals
with
interlocutory
orders.
we're
talking
about
a
final--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--order.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
well,
as
recently
as
1994
in
the
digital
equipment
case,
this
court
affirmed
that
the
final...
the
collateral
order
doctrine
under
cohen
is
a
construction
of
the
final
order
rule.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
right.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
that's
a
harder
question,
but
in
our
view,
yes,
you
should
be
able
to
bring
that
claim
up,
and
that
goes
to
the
dialogue
that
i
was
having
with
justice
breyer.
the
first...
on
the
first
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
both
the
existence
of
the
letter
and
also
the
existence
of
other
concrete
steps,
perhaps
a
compact
among
the
regulators
to
blacklist
this
fellow.
after
discovery,
those
concrete
steps
were
absent.
they
weren't
born
out,
and
so
you
have
a
different
legal
claim
as
of
the
attempted
second
appeal,
and
that
claim
should
be
tested.
the
court
of
appeals
should
issue
an
authoritative
ruling
whether
that
claim
is
based
on
clearly
established
law
before
this
official
has
to
be
subjected
to
burdens
of
discovery
and
trial.
