justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yes,
every...
you
could
be,
like,
have
a
thousand
things
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
which
would
technically
be
a
little
different
one
from
the
other.
i
take
justice
kennedy
to
be
asking
what
would
be
my
question.
a
person
moves
for
dismissal
of
the
complaint
on
the
ground,
taking
the
facts
as
in
the
complaint,
that
it
doesn't
show
a
clear
violation
of
the
law.
the
district
judge
says,
yes,
it
does.
the
court
of
appeals
says,
yes,
it
does.
so
now
you
go
back,
and
now
you
can
only
get
a
subset
of
the
facts,
and
once
again
the
defendant
says
the
same
thing.
the
district
court
says,
yes,
it
does.
now,
can
he
get
another
appeal?
of
course.
of
course
it's
a
little
bit
different.
now
you
have
a
subset
of
the
facts
that
were
there
in
the
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
that's
enough,
i
don't
see...
my
problem
is,
i
don't
see
how
that
satisfies
the
separate
issue.
there
are
four...
i...
we
just
wrote
on
this
last
year,
and
what
i'm
having
is
seeing
how
this...
the
two
appeals
there
satisfy
the
test
that
came
down
in
cohen,
that
it
should
really
be
quite
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
case.
that
means
really
very
separate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
if,
in
fact,
you
then
have
a
56(f)
response
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
then
he
says,
oh,
i
see,
we
need
some
more
facts,
and
then
we
get
a
few
more,
and
then
there's
another
56(f),
then
we
get
another
affidavit,
and
i
mean,
you
could
have
50
appeals
on
that
theory,
couldn't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
seen
a
lot
of
56(f)
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
each
time
the
difference
is
not
the
legal...
the
only
thing
that's
changed
is
the
facts
that
you
take
as
the
predicate
for
asking
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
could
have
no
dispute
as
to
facts.
first,
you
take
the
facts
as
they
are,
might
be
stated
in
the
complaint,
which
is
vague.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
difference
is,
later
on
the
56
motion
there's
a
subset
of
facts,
those
that
could
be
proved,
given
discovery,
and
the
third
time,
after
you
went
back
under
56(f),
you
have
a
slightly
different
subset
of
facts,
so
what's
changed
is
the
factual
predicate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
theoretically
worried
about
the
practical
problem,
i'm
theoretically
worried
about
the
theoretical
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is...
that
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
considerable
degree
of
separability--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--between
the...
what's...
you
get
a
collateral
appeal
on.
i
mean,
you
know,
your
cohen
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
does...
is
that
what
the
issue
turns
on
in
your
opinion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whether
or
not
discovery
reveals
a
set
of
facts
that
varies
a
lot
from
what
the
judge
thought
was
there
in
the
complaint,
or
varies
just
a
little?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
taken
in
what
was
my
question
on
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
tried
to
ask
it
before.
i'd
be
interested
in
your
response.
this
is
a
fluke,
this
case,
in
my
mind.
it's
a
very
weird
case,
never
going
to
come
up
again.
they
didn't
waive
their
second
appeal
anyway.
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
special
features,
so
i'm
not
focusing
on
this
case.
i'm
thinking,
on
the
general
case,
and
you
move
for...
dismiss
the
complaint.
no.
now
you
get
some
facts,
move
again.
do
you
get
one
appeal
or
two?
that's
the
issue,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
was
bothering
me
is
in
johnson
what
i
thought
the
court
was
trying
to
do
is
to
set...
not
have
a
mitchell
claim.
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
mitchell
claim.
what
there
is
is,
there's
a
whole
law
called
collateral
order
appeal
law,
of
which
this
is
a
part,
and
it's
that.
i
don't
know
how
to
reconcile
your
desire
for
two
appeals,
or
three,
or
whatever,
with
that.
that
was
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
of
course.
the
whole
point
of
the
collateral
order
doctrine
is
when
the
only
difference
is
changes
of
a
fair...
you
know,
fact
changes.
that
doesn't
count.
there's
a
difference.
that's
what...
that
doesn't
count
as
a
difference.
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
difference
is
a
difference
in
whether
you're
asking
qualified
immunity
or
merits
of
the
case.
that's
a
difference.
i
don't
think
that
flows
from
johnson,
but
the
question
is,
for
example,
if
you
have
in
the
complaint
allegations
of
three
elements,
a,
b,
and
c,
and
then
you
take
discovery
and
you
move
to
dismiss,
you
say,
that
doesn't
state
a
violation
of
a
clearly
established
right.
the
court
disagrees
with
you,
the
court
of
appeals
disagrees
with
you.
you
go
through
discovery.
after
discovery,
the
undisputed
facts
show
only
elements
a
and
b.
what
you
can
appeal
at
that
time,
consistent
with
johnson,
is
the
question
whether,
given
a
and
b,
you
have
stated
a
claim,
or
supported
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
a
claim
of
a
violation
of
clearly
established
law.
if
a
and
b
just
don't
violate
clearly
established
law,
that
is
a
qualified
immunity
determination,
and
that
is
something
that
is
not
barred
by
johnson,
and
that
is
something
that
is...
should
be
allowed
under
this
case.
it's
also
something
that
this
court
has
expressly
recognized
previously--
--ms.
pillard,
if
i
can--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
suppose
you've
abandoned
this
because
you'll
lose
the
case,
perhaps,
but
i
thought
the
theory
was
that
there
is
a
rule
under
cohen,
which
governed
mitchell,
which
says
that
you
only
get
the
appeal
if
the
thing
you're
appealing
on
resolves
an
important
issue
completely
separate
from
the
merits,
which
is
effectively
unreviewable.
so
the
first
time
a
person
appeals
from
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
that's
not
effectively
separate
and
conclusive
compared
to
his
later
appeal
for
denial
of
summary
judgment.
as
long
as
those
two
things
are
out
there,
you
can't
say
that
the
first
is
completely
separate
despite
the
factual
change,
for
if
you
did,
thousands
of
discovery
orders
would
become
immediately
appealable.
now,
that's
what...
i
mean,
but
if
that's
the
theory,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
win,
because
their
client...
you
see,
the
only
way...
they're
appealing
the
summary
judgment
stage,
which
is
completely
separate
from
the
later
trial
order.
it's...
the
two
that
aren't
separate
are
the
first
two,
the
dismissal...
is
that
too
complicated?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
seeing
what
i'm
driving
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
case
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
the
first
circuit,
what
people
said
was,
look,
you
got...
you
want
your
appeal
now,
dismissal
of
complaint,
you
waive
the
later
one.
otherwise,
it's
not
final.
and
then
the
reason
they
couldn't
do
the
second
one
was
because
they'd
waived
it,
but
that
didn't
happen
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
was
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
was
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
a
special,
separate
constitutional
right
not
to
undergo
discovery?
what
is
the
source
of--
