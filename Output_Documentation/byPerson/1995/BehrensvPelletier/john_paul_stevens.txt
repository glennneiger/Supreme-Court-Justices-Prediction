paul
stevens
in
that
kind
of
case,
where
there's
an
argument
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
and
yet
there
is
some
indication
that
further
pleadings
and
discovery
will
elucidate
the
issues,
does
the
district
court
have
the
authority
to
say,
i
want
all
summary
judgment
motions
relating
to
sovereign
immunity
deferred
until
6
months
of
discovery
has
gone
by,
i'm
not
even
going
to
rule
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
or
must
he
rule
on
the
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
use
the
term,
interlocutory
appeal.
actually,
you
do
contend
it's
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment,
in
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
having
used
that
word,
it
prompts
this
question
in
my
mind:
assuming
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
might
be
right...
i
don't
know...
and
then
you've
had
one
appeal
the
first
time,
could
you
have
asked
the
district
judge
for
a
1292(b)
certification
to
get
an
interlocutory
appeal,
as
you
use
the
term?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
always
at
least
a
safeguard
in
a
really
unusual
case
that
perhaps
you
could
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
because...
that's
because
there
is
a
sort
of
a
basic
policy
disfavoring
xx
appeals--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
either...
that's
the
background.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
have
a
cases
in
which
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
there's
an
appeal,
and
the
alleged
government
defendant
loses
the
appeal,
and
then
there's
more
discovery
and
he
appeals
again,
in
a
way
you
can
say
that
the
second
factor
of
cohen
has
not
been
satisfied,
because
the
defendant
takes
the
appeal
on
the
first
go-around
on
the
theory
that
this
will
be
dispositive
of
the
case,
and
he's
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
point
is
that
the
defendant
was
wrong
on
the
first
appeal,
because
it
didn't
conclusively
dispose
of
the
case.
then
he
gets
a
second
appeal
to
try
it
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
our
rule-making
authority,
would
we
have
the
authority
to
make
a
rule
that
there
could
be
no
second
appeal
without
the
permission
of
the
district
court
and
a
certification
that
there
were,
i
don't
know,
extraordinary
circumstances,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical,
where
the
identical
claim
is
made
the
second
time
round,
you
say
that
would
be
improper,
but
would
it
not
always
be
possible
for
the
defendant
to
shade
the
facts
a
little
bit
and
at
least
have
the
right
to
argue
that
it
is
not
the
identical
claim?
it
would
be
an
issue
on
appeal
as
to
whether
it
was
identical
or
not
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
really,
in
every
case
there
would
be
jurisdiction
to
file
the
appeal
and
to
get
some
attention
from
the
court
of
appeals
on
whether
this
is
the
special
case
or
it's
just
a
routine
delaying
tactic.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
but
what
happens
to
the
trial
while
the
case...
while
the
appeal
is
filed
and
the
court
of
appeals
takes
a
look
at
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
trial
stops,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there's
a
maximum
of
two
appeals,
or
could
there
be
cases
where
there
might
be
three?
