justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if
we
had
authority
to
make
that
rule,
then
the
statute
is
not
the
answer
to
the
case.
there
would
be
no
conflict
with
your
statutory
right
to
appeal
if
we
enacted
such
a
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your
view
in
this
case,
does
he
get
a
second
bite
at
the
apple,
at
the
issue
that
was
determined
the
first
time
around?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
requirement
is
not
fulfilled
if
he
fails
on
the
first
appeal,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
it
goes
on
much
longer,
he'll
be
retired.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
they
would
argue
that
this
is
an
exceptional
case.
the
district
court
had
it
wrong
the
first
go-around
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
court
of
appeals
gave
some
advice
to
correct
it,
and
so
now
the
issue's
back
in
front
of
them.
that
sounds
rather
unusual.
