well,
one
of
the
claims
is
that
pelletier
had
a
constitutionally
protected
property
interest
in
his
employment
with
pioneer--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
you
argued
there
is
no
such
constitutionally
protected
property
interest
because
the
employment
was
subject
to
federal
regulatory
approval.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
is
that
issue
still
here,
or
gone?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
legal
issue
was
never
decided?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
imagine
a
situation
where
the
defendant
government
employee
files
his
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
a
purely
legal
argument,
it's
denied,
appeal
is
filed,
loses
on
appeal,
then
he
tries
to
raise
the
identical
argument
again
at
the
summary
judgment
stage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
