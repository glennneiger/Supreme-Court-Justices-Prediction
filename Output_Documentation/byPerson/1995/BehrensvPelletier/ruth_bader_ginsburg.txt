justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
come
back
to
that,
because
you've
been
talking
on
a
highly
abstract
plain--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i'm
having
difficulty
understanding
the
basic
underlying
claims.
there
are
two
bivens
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
the
same
law
govern
both
of
them,
or
are
they
different?
i
know
one
is
for
losing
a
job
and
the
other
is
for
the
inability
to
get
a
future
job,
but
what
law...
what
is
the
content
of
the
substantive
rule
that
applies
to
each
of
those
claims,
the
same
rule,
different
rule,
or
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
constitutional
right
at
stake
in
the
two
claims,
you
just
told
me
the
second
one,
it's
a
liberty
interest--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
have
a
protected
liberty
interest--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--which
you
say
was
taken--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
in
the
first,
the
case
of
losing
the
job--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
also
a
liberty
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
deprivation
of
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
liberty,
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
one
is
a
property
claim
and
the
other
is
a
liberty
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they're
both
substantive
due
process
claims.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
have
a
question
that
at
least
is
important
to
me,
and
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
what
your
answer
to
it
is.
in
your
control
devices
which
you've
just
been
outlining,
you
conspicuously
don't
mention
the
rule-making
authority
that
congress
newly
gave
to
the
courts
both
under
the
20...
1291
type
final
order
and
the
interlocutory
order
review,
the
1292(e),
the
new
1292(e)
and
the
2072(c).
you
must
have
known
they
were
there.
why
didn't
you...
the
silence
is
deafening
with
respect
to
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
cohen--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--v.
beneficial
really
is,
but
we
call
it
a
final--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
it
is
a
construction
of
1291.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
every
other
sense
it
is
interim
in
the
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
defendant's
argument
at
the
12(b)(6)
stage
was,
even
if
we
take
everything
you
say
as
true,
it...
even
if
we
take
everything
the
plaintiff
says
is
true,
still
the
law
was
not
clearly
settled
with
respect
to
that,
and
that's
the
point
that
the
first
appeal
turned
on,
at
least
with
respect
to
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
what
do
you
do
with
the
second
claim?
there
was
never
a
first
appeal
because
the
district
court
went
off
on...
wrongly,
as
it
turned
out,
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rees--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the...
you
start
out
with
a
one-appeal
rule,
and
that
has
the
kind
of
a
flavor
of
a
legislative
measure
rather
than
a
court-type
doctrine,
and
then,
well,
i
asked
ms.
pillard
why
didn't
the
government
seem
to
think
this
was
a
matter
for
rule-making,
and
she
said,
well
there's
this
mitchell...
but
there
have
been
privileges
before,
most
famously
perhaps
the
work-product
privilege,
that
start
out
with
a
court
doctrine.
hickman
v.
taylor
was
a
court
doctrine,
and
then
it
got
embodied
in
the
federal
rules
after.
so
why
isn't
the
appropriate
thing
now
for
the
courts
to
use
the
rule-making
authority
that
congress
gave
them
rather
than
to
say,
oh,
we're
going
to
pick
a
one-appeal
rule
or
a
two-appeal
rule,
and
we're
going
to
try
through
adjudication
to
have
that
kind
of
a
legislative
field
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
no
sure
that
i
understand
what
your
answer
to
why
it
should
be
done
through
adjudication.
is
it
because
it's
easy
and
it's
clear,
so
you
don't
need
the
rule-making
committee
with
the
law
professors
and
the
lawyers
and
the
judges?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that's
the
first
place
where
congress...
it
was
even
before
adding
to
the
1292.
in
2072,
congress
in
1990
gave
the
courts
authority
which
they've
never
used
to
deal
with
the
1291
type.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
cohen
v.
beneficial--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--type.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand...
it
was
a
discrete
claim,
so
you
could
have
asked
the
judge
for
a
54(b)
final,
final
judgment.
then
you
would
have
had--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why?
you
were
out
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
a
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
claim
was
over
and
done.
you...
couldn't
you
have
gotten
a
final,
final
judgment
by
asking
the
court
for
a
54(b)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
disposed
of
one
discrete
claim,
didn't
it?
