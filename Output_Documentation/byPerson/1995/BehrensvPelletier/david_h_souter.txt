justice
david
h.
souter
well,
wouldn't
you
argue
that,
because
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
that...
or
wouldn't
the
argument
be
that
one
of
the
protections
is
a
protection
against
discovery,
so
if
that's
going
to
be
the
case,
then
necessarily
the
argument
would
be,
rule
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
first?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
weiss,
may
i
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question?
don't
you
have
to
say...
he
says,
you
know,
first
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss,
then
there's
some
discovery,
and
there's
a
new
motion
based
on
the
subset
of
the
facts
assumed
in
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
then
there
may
be
another
motion
based
on
a...
if
that
fails,
on
yet
a
smaller
subset,
and
so
on.
don't
you
have
to
say
that
as
between
stage
1
and
stage
2
there's
got
to
be
a
right
to
take
it
up,
because
one
of
the
express
objects
of
qualified
immunity
is
protection
against
discovery,
so
you
get
that
appeal
based
on
the
concept
of
what
we're
protecting
on
qualified
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
you
lose.
you
go
back,
and
you
have
some
discovery.
you
go
up
again
on
another
subset
because
you
have
a
right,
among
other
things,
to
avoid
trial,
and
then
the
problem
is,
can
you
keep
on
narrowing
your
subsets
down?
oh,
too
bad,
we
lose,
we'll
go
back
and
have
more
discovery,
more
discovery,
more
discovery.
isn't
the
answer
to
the
sort
of
endless
series
of
subsets
that
it's
up
to
the
trial
court,
in
effect,
to
manage
discovery
and
say,
have
your
discovery.
finish
your
discovery,
then
file
your
summary
judgment
motion.
you
get
one
summary
judgment
motion
at
that
point,
and
isn't
that
the
way
to
avoid
this
prospect
of,
in
effect,
endless
appeal,
on
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
yes,
and
isn't
the
power
of
the
court
to
manage
discovery
and
to
limit
the
number
of
summary
judgment
motions
that
it's
going
to
entertain,
you
know,
barring
some
lightning
bolt
of
something
new?
isn't
that
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
the...
the,
sort
of
the
endless
series
of
subset
summary
judgments?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
really
saying
the
only
prospect
is
really
two
1291
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
it
would
make...
it
would
require
a
substantive
revision
of
qualified
immunity
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
excuse
me,
i
thought
the
first
appeal
determined
only
that
there
had
been
a
claim
which,
if
proven
to
be
true,
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
established
rights
had
been
violated.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
didn't
hold
that
they
had
been.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
held
that
a
claim
had
been
stated.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
true.
on
those
facts.
on
those
facts
as
pleaded.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
when
you
say
trial,
you
mean
trial
on
any
issue
whatsoever,
so
that
if
any--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry,
then
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
there's
more
than
one
civil
rights
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
if
there's
going
to
be
a
trial
on
any
civil
rights
claim,
that
in
effect
defeats
the
right
to
a
further
1291
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
or
even
the
first,
i
guess.
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
excuse
me,
could
you
give
me
a
yes
or
no,
if
it's...
if
that's
possible,
and
then
explain?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
as
the
chief
justice
said,
the
district
court
does
not
have
to
allow
an
infinite
number
of
summary
judgment
motions.
a
district
court
can
say,
okay,
you've
lost
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
have
your
discovery.
when
the
discovery
is
over,
i
will
entertain
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
on
whatever
grounds,
multiple
grounds
you
may
have.
the
district
court
can
do
that,
can't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
answer
is
yes,
it
can.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
if
the
motion
to
dismiss
assumes
facts
a,
b,
and
c,
and
it
is
lost,
the
case
comes
back...
after
a
cohen
appeal
the
case
comes
back.
discovery,
takes
place.
there
is
now...
it
is
now,
as
in
his
hypo,
clear
that
c
cannot
be
proven,
so
that
the
facts
are
merely
a
and
b.--
if
you
eliminate
the
appeal
when
the
district
court
denies
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
a
and
b
alone,
then,
as
a
practical
matter,
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
totally
undercut,
if
you
have
not
destroyed,
that
aspect
of
our
qualified
immunity
doctrine
which
says
you
ought
to
be
protected
from
discovery.
you're
saying,
if
you
lose
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
you
have
no
further
protection
from
discovery.
if
you
want
to
postpone
your
motion
to
dismiss,
then
you've
got
to
go
through
discovery,
which
destroys
the
right
to
immunity
from
that.
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what
if
the...
the
district
court
says,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
go
up
on...
following
the
denial
of
your
motion
to
dismiss,
because
i
want
to
make
sure
discovery
is
over
before
you
appeal.
or
what
if
the
district
court
says,
i
simply
won't
rule
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
pleadings.
i'm
going
to
wait
until
after
you
have
completed
discovery.
that
would
be
a
way...
and
file
any
summary
judgment
motions,
and
so
on.
that
would
be
a
good
practical
way
of
limiting
the
appeals
to
one
appeal,
but
it
would
destroy
the
immunity
from
discovery,
the
qualified
immunity
protection
from
discovery--
justice
david
h.
souter
--wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's...
yes,
and
it
would
destroy
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
the
district
court--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
the
district
court
did
that,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
qualified
immunity
protection
against
discovery,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
assume
the
district
court
just
takes
this
in
hand
and
does
what
i
have
outlined.
that
would
destroy
the
qualified
immunity
protection
against
discovery,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
same
result
on
the
one
appeal
rule
that
you
want.
if
you're
saying,
if
you
take
your
one
appeal
after
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
before
discovery,
and
you
can't
appeal
again,
then
the
defendant
is
going
to
have
to
say,
well,
do
i
in
fact
want
this
qualified
immunity
right
against
discovery?
and
if
he
says,
yes,
i
do,
then
he
cannot
take
a
cohen
appeal
from
a
final
order
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and...
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
either
have
one
appeal,
or
you're
going
to
destroy,
in
effect,
the
discovery
protection.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
like
saying
you
can
condition
anything
on
the
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right.
do
you
think
there's
an
obligation
on
the
defendant
in
order
to
justify
the
cohen
appeal
to
say
that
his
first
appeal
must
conclusively
determine
the
question?
that's
a
requirement
of
cohen,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
when
you
say
multiple,
what
is
your
response
to
the
fact
that
if
the...
to
the,
i
thought
fairly
plausible
argument
that
if
the
district
court
does,
indeed,
manage
its
discovery
and
its
summary
judgment
practice,
the
so-called
multiple
is
really
a
practical
maximum
of
two
appeals.
there
would
be
one,
presumably,
following
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
there
would
be
another
one,
potentially,
following
all
the
discovery
and
all
the
summary
judgments.
that's
two.
do
you
think
that's
an
unsound
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
you
don't
have
an
intracircuit
problem
of
chaos.
let's
assume
that
the
district
court
is,
in
fact,
going
to
manage
the
discovery
in
the
way
that
i
have
suggested,
the
government
suggested.
is
that
an
unsound
argument
which
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
as
a
practical
matter
you're
going
to
have
a
potential
of
two
appeals
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases?
is
that
unsound?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it...
is
that
an
unsound
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i'm
not
balancing.
i'm
just
saying,
is
that
an
unsound
argument?
is
it
going
to
result
in
two
appeals
as
a
max,
in
most
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we've
said
it's...
the
defendant
has
got
a
constitutional
qualified
immunity
interest
to
avoid
discovery.
he's
only
doing
what
we've
told
him
he's
got
a
right
to
insist
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
you're
branding
him
as
somebody,
in
fact,
who's
taking
advantage
of
the
system,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
so-called
system
is
the
qualified
immunity
system,
which
we
have
recognized.
do
you
agree
that
the
qualified
immunity
defense
is
constitutionally
mandated?
there's
no
constitutional
basis
for
it,
is
there?
is...
yes,
right.
i
mean,
don't
criminals
every
day
of
the
week
have
to
go
to
trial
where
the
district
court
has
had
terribly
erroneous
rulings
of
all
kinds.
they
can't
appeal
in
the
middle
of
the
case.
is
there
something
called
a
constitutional
right
that
even
though
you
can
appeal,
so
you
don't
have
to
go
to
trial,
you
also
have
a
separate
constitutional
right
in
a
civil
case
not
to
undergo
discovery?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
in
any
case,
we've
recognized
it,
and
we
would
have
to
go
back
on
our
prior
rulings
in
order
to
accommodate
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
there
is
a
separate
cognizable
interest,
whatever
its
origin,
constitutional,
or
what-not,
if
there's
a
separate
cognizable
interest
in
avoiding
discovery,
then
why
have
we
expanded
anything
in
recognizing
the...
we'll
call
it
the
maximum
two-appeal
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it's
not
that
important,
why
did
we
recognize
it
in
the
first
place?
