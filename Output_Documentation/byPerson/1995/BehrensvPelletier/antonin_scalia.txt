justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought,
mr.
weiss,
that
your
response
to
the
theoretical
problem
as
that
it's
not
a
subset
of
the
facts,
it's
a
totally
different
set
of
facts,
and
hence
a
totally
different
issue
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
decision
based
on
just
the
pleadings
is
simply
a
decision
that
when
you
say,
i
was
seriously
injured,
that
states
a
cause
of
action,
because
conceivably
some
facts
could
be
brought
out
that
show
that
that's
enough.
what
happens
at
the
later
stage
is
that
the
serious
injury
consists
of
no
more
than
depriving
you
of
cinnamon
toast
instead
of...
instead
of
whole
wheat
toast
in
the
prison
cafeteria.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
different
issue
of
law,
whether
that
is
something
that
can
be
sued
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
can
be
eliminated
by
our
rulemaking
under
2072?
was
that
your
response
under
2072,
that
even
what
you're
arguing
for
could
be
eliminated?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
why
i
asked.
i
don't,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
subsection
(b)
says
such
rules
shall
not
abridge,
enlarge
or
modify
any
substantive
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't
balance
interests
until
we
have
a
basis
for
doing
that.
what
i
am
not
clear
on,
mr.
rees,
is
what
is
the
hook
on
which
you're
hanging
your
hat
here?
what
is
the
theoretical
reason
why
we
can
come
up
with
a
numerical
rule,
only
one,
apart
from
the
fact
that
it's
a
good
idea?
i
mean,
for
example,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
think
that
a
two-term
limit
for
congressmen
is
a
good
idea,
but
nobody
has
come
into
the
court
and
said,
you,
know,
impose
a
two-term
limit.
you
know,
two
is
enough.
and
that's
what
you're
coming...
you're
saying,
one
is
enough.
why...
i
need
a
text.
i
need
some
legal
gimmick--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
reach
that
result.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now,
wait.
i
don't
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
immunity
right
does
not
exist
unless
the
whole
trial
is
eliminated?
you
can't
get
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
some
of
the
issues
in
the
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
the
first
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rees,
could
i
recall
you
to
my
question?
as
i
understand
it,
your
response
to
my
question
as
to
what
gives
us
the
right
to
say
one
only
is
the
fact
that
the
right
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
here,
which
is
deemed
a
final
appeal
under
the
statute,
is
only
a
right
to
eliminate
the
trial
entirely.
is
that
your
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
your
theory,
and
that's
why
you
think
you're
entitled
to
judgment
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
position
makes
entire
sense
if
you
are
correct
in
referring
to
"the
qualified
immunity
issue"
as
though
it
is
a
single
issue
at
all
stages,
but
that's
the
vice
of
it.
in
fact,
it's
a
quite
different
issue
when
it
comes
up
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage
and
when
it
comes
up
after
discovery.
we
then
discover
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
something
quite
different,
and
what
you're
saying
is,
you
simply
have
to
abandon
your
ability
to
challenge
the
one
issue
if
you
want
to
challenge
the
later
one,
and
the
price
of
it
is
discovery.
they're
two
different
issues,
however.
justice
antonin
scalia
there...
surely
there
are
deterrents.
i
mean,
if
it
is
frivolous
it
can
be
sanctioned,
can
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
after
the
fact,
but
the
knowledge
that
it
will
happen
after
the
fact
tends
to
deter
one's
committing
the
fact,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
addition
to
sanctions,
the
lawyers
i
know
don't
like
to
go
up
on
a
frivolous
appeal
and
come
back
to
the
same
judge.
it
always
comes
back
to
the
same
judge,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
not
enough,
you
say,
under...
to
invoke
the
exception...
the
cohen
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
problem
is,
if
that's
not
enough
at
appeal
two,
i
don't
know
why
it's
not
enough
at
appeal...
why
it
is
enough
at
appeal
one.
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
extend
that
principle
to
the
first
round,
too,
wouldn't
you,
and
say
unless
you're
challenging
the
entire
lawsuit,
you
cannot
ask
that
some
of
it
be
thrown
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
mean,
why
just
the
qualified
issue?
why
not
just...
why
not
all
issues?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
position
is
that
so
long
as
you
make
one
claim
that
will
survive
a
qualified
immunity
challenge
you
can
thereupon
add
to
it
as
many
other
claims
as
you
want,
all
of
which
will
become
immunized
from
a
qualified
immunity
challenge,
because
after
all,
the
one
claim
is
going
to
have
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
therefore
the
matter
will
not
be
completely
disposed
of
by
a
cohen
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
precisely
your
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
that
all
of
the
qualified
immunity
stuff
has
to
be
disposed
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
so
long
as
one
of
the
claims
is
clearly
not
subject
to
a
qualified
immunity
defense,
you've
got
one
good
claim,
you
can
thereupon
pile
on
as
many
invalid
claims
as
you
like,
and
you
cannot
take
it
up
under
cohen.
justice
antonin
scalia
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
one,
there's
no
basis
for
it.
one,
clearly
the
case
can't
be
thrown
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
hope
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent,
pelletier
got
a
job
as
a
managing
officer
at
pioneer
savings
and
loan
association.
his
appointment
was
however
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
board
which
one
of
the
conditions
for
pioneer's
receiving
federal
deposit
insurance
protection.
because
respondent
was
at
that
under
investigation
for
misconduct
relating
to
the
collapse
of
another
california
s&l,
his
appointment
was
not
approved;
instead
pioneer
savings
and
loan
received
a
letter
from
petitioner,
behrens
on
behalf
of
the
home
loan
bank
board,
advising
that
respondent
should
be
removed,
as
a
consequence
respondent
was
fired.
three
years
later,
he
filed
suit
in
federal
court
against
petitioner
and
others
alleging
that
the
removal
request
had
caused
him
his
employment
by
pioneer
and
deprived
him
of
the
ability
to
be
employed
elsewhere
in
the
savings
and
loan
industry.
respondent
claimed
that
petitioner's
conduct
had
deprived
him
of
property
and
liberty
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
petitioner
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss.
this
is
a
pre-trial
motion
which
asserts
that
assuming
all
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
to
be
true,
they
do
not
state
a
valid
cause
of
action.
the
basis
for
petitioner’s
motion
was
his
claim
of
qualified
immunity,
a
defense
which
under
our
precedents
entitles
government
officers
to
avoid
standing
trial
for
the
consequences
of
their
official
acts
unless
a
reasonable
person
would
have
recognized
that
the
conduct
complaint
would
violate
a
clearly
established
right.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
respondent
appealed
that
decision
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
ordinarily,
under
the
statute's
governing
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals,
denials
of
pre-trial
motions
are
not
immediately
appealable
because
they
are
not
considered
final
decisions
as
the
statute
governing
appeals
requires.
there
are
exceptions
to
this
general
rule
however
and
one
of
them
is
for
denials
for
pre-trial
assertions
of
qualified
immunity.
thus,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
entertained
petitioner’s
appeal.
in
doing
so,
however,
it
stated
in
dictum
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
only
one
such
pre-trial
appeal
of
a
denial
of
qualified
immunity.
on
the
merits,
the
court
affirmed,
the
district
court’s
ruling
since
it
concluded
that
respondent's
allegations
in
the
complaint
which
included
what
it
what
it
called,
nebulous
theories
of
conspiracy
would,
if
true,
establish
that
petitioner
had
violated
clearly
established
rights
enjoyed
by
respondent.
after
--
we
are
not
done
with
the
facts
yet
--
after
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
on
remand,
petitioner
moved
for
summary
judgment.
this
is
another
sort
of
pre-trial
motion
which
asserts
that
the
general
allegations
of
the
complaint
do
not
set
forth
a
valid
cause
of
action,
but
that
the
concrete
uncounted
facts
brought
forward
in
sworn
testimony
up
to
that
stage
in
the
lawsuit
show
that
plaintiff
does
not
have
a
valid
claim.
the
basis
for
petitioner’s
motion
was
that
the
uncontested
facts
demonstrated
the
availability
of
once
again
qualified
immunity.
this
motion
was
similarly
denied
and
petitioner
again
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
making
good
on
its
prior
statement
that
only
one
pre-trial
appeal
based
on
qualified
immunity
would
be
allowed
in
any
case.
the
ninth
circuit
summarily
dismissed
the
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
petitioner
argues
that
that
decision
was
wrong
that
a
district
court
order
denying
qualified
immunity
is
every
bit
as
much
of
a
final
decision
subject
to
review
on
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
occurs
at
summary
judgment
stage
as
when
it
occurs
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage.
even
if
the
defendant
has
already
appealed
a
prior
adverse
qualified
immunity
ruling
on
a
motion
to
dismissed.
we
agree.
our
precedent
establishes
that
a
pre-trial
denial
of
qualified
immunity
is
a
final
decision
subject
to
immediate
appeal
whether
that
denial
answers
a
motion
to
dismissor
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
even
if
it
were
unquestionably
desirable
to
have
only
one
appeal
involving
the
issue
of
qualified
immunity,
the
means
of
achieving
that
end
simply
do
not
exist
within
the
framework
of
determining
what
is
or
is
not
a
final
decision.
if,
as
we
have
said
in
the
past,
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
qualified
immunity
grounds
is
a
final
decision.
the
existence
of
a
prior
unsuccessful
appeal
in
a
given
case
cannot
possibly
make
it
any
lesser
final
decision
which
is
the
only
question
that
appelability
turns
on.
we
point
out
that
although
the
same
defense
of
qualified
immunity
may
be
twice
appealed
under
our
holding.
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
twice
faced
with
the
same
question.
in
reviewing
a
denial
of
motion
to
dismiss
the
subject
of
the
first
appeal,
the
appellate
court
decides
whether
the
plaintiff’s
allegations
are
sufficient
to
defeat
the
assertion
of
immunity.
a
defendant
who
loses
that
first
round
can
later
assert
after
the
exchange
of
affidavits
that
typically
follows
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
the
plaintiff
can
not
backup
those
allegations
in
the
complaint.
that
none
of
the
evidence
before
the
court
stands
in
the
way
of
the
immunity
defense.
since
it
is
not
unknown
for
plaintiffs
to
allege
more
than
that
they
can
later
prove,
the
qualified
immunity
question
pose
that
this
later
summary
judgments
stage
will
generally
call
for
a
different
analysis
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
sometimes
a
different
decision
as
to
the
defendant’s
entitlement
to
immunity.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
remand
the
case
for
consideration
of
petitioner’s
appeal
from
the
denial
of
summary
judgment.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
joins.
