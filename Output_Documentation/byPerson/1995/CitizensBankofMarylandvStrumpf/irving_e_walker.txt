mr.
irving
e.
walker
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
single
issue
involving
the
interpretation
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
that
issue
is
whether
a
bank
creditor
may
refuse
a
debtor
depositor's
request
to
withdraw
funds
pending
a
bankruptcy
court's
determination
of
the
bank's
right
of
setoff
without
violating
the
automatic
stay.
the
court's
answer
to
this
question
should
govern
the
conduct
of
nonbank
and
bank
creditors
alike,
including
the
united
states
government.
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
bank's
refusal
to
allow
the
debtor
to
withdraw
funds
to
the
extent
of
the
bank's
setoff
right,
what
is
referred
to
commonly
as
an
administrative
hold,
is
tantamount
to
a
setoff.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
justice
o'connor,
a
setoff
occurs
when
there
is
an
intention
to
effect
a
settlement
of
mutual
debts.
it
has
several
attributes.
one
is
that
the
creditor
intends
to
do
it.
two,
there
is
an
affirmative
action
which
results
in
a
bank
account
balance
actually
being
reduced
in
a
corresponding
amount.
the
bank's
claim
is
reduced,
and
there
is
invariably
a
record
evidencing
that
the
setoff
occurred.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
a
matter
of
fed...
excuse
me.
i
believe
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law
consistent
with
justice
breyer's
view
when
he
was
with
the
first
circuit
in
the
saugus
general
hospital
case,
that
in
determining
when
a
setoff
occurs,
consistent--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--yes,
your
honor,
and
there
is--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--i
do
not
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
the
federal
bankruptcy
code,
of
course,
determines
what
conduct
is
permissible
under
the
code,
and
our
view
is
that
administrative
hold
is
expressly
permitted
under
section
542(b).
mr.
irving
e.
walker
more
than
that,
your
honor.
intention
would
be
one
factor.
first,
i
should
point
out
there
is
no
maryland
reported
case
expressly
telling
any
of
us
exactly
when
a
setoff
occurs,
and
therefore
we
look
to
the
general
common
law
and
the
federal
cases
considering
nonbankruptcy
and
state
law
have
generally
agreed,
at
least
at
the
circuit
court
level
and
below,
with
our
view
of
the
case,
namely
that
there
needs
to
be
an
intent,
there
needs
to
be
an
affirmative
act
to
change
the
status
quo,
and
that's
a
key
point
in
our
case,
your
honors.
an
administrative
hold,
consistent
with
the
purpose
behind
the
automatic
stay,
accomplishes
a
preservation
of
the
status
quo,
and
that's
quite--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--yes,
your
honor.
it's
a
change
from
the
moment
before
the
hold
is
placed,
but
the
status
quo
which
is
most
important,
your
honor,
is
the
status
quo
immediately
prior
to
bankruptcy
and
the
status
quo
immediately
after
bankruptcy,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
determined
by
looking
at
the
depositor's
right
to
withdraw
funds
under
its
contract
with
the
bank.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
that
is
certainly
a
factor,
yes.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
where
you
would--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
way
i
would
measure
the
change
is
looking
at
the
debtor's
rights
prior
to
bankruptcy
to
withdraw
funds.
that
right
was
conditioned
by
contract
in
maryland
law
by
the
bank's
right
to
set
off
the
account
upon
default.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
justice
souter,
i
agree
with
your
view
of
it.
you
have
well
and
succinctly
stated
the
strength
of
our
case,
and
namely
that
section
3--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--i
welcome
it.
section
3--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
strongly
disagree
with
that.
there
is
a
temporal
aspect
to
it,
because
an
administrative
hold
is
a
temporary
preservation
of
the
amount
of
the
bank
balance,
the
amount
of
the
bank
claim
pending
bankruptcy
court
review.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
your
honor,
i
believe
there's
very
clear
language
in
the
bankruptcy
code
itself
which
tells
the
court
what
governs.
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
page
a7
of
our
original
brief,
where
the
court
will
find
the
statute
section
542(b),
the
language
i
would
specifically
refer
to
is
where
the
creditor
is
directed
to
pay
such
debt
to
or
on
the
order
of
the
trustee
except
to
the
extent
that
such
debt
may
be
offset
under
section
553.
the
phrase
"may
be
offset"
clearly
indicates
it
is
permissible
to
withhold
payment
short
of
a
setoff.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
it
could
come
up
in
the
context
of
a
turnover
proceeding.
we
recognize
that
as
a
proper
way
for
a
debtor
who
wishes
to
bring
the
issue
to
a
head
to
address
the
point.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
justice
kennedy,
let
me
address
that,
and
i'll
try
to
give
a
more
complete
answer
to
justice
ginsburg.
first,
this
is
really
respondent's
point,
that
a
court
order
is
required
before
an
administrative
hold
can
be
placed.
if
there
is
one
point
this
court
should
know
the
bankruptcy
code
is
perfectly
clear
about,
that
is
when
a
court
order
is
required.
the
code
is
replete
with
instances
when
an
order
is
required.
in
fact,
section
542
itself,
in
subpart
(e),
refers
to
a
court
order.
payment
of
professionals,
employment
of
professionals,
the
code
says
when
a
court
order
is
required.
542(b)
does
not
contain
any
reference
to
a
court
order.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
i
believe
it
should
your
honor,
and
i
recognize--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--i
believe
there
are
requirements,
your
honor.
there
could
well
be
requirements
under
state
law.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
then
a
bank
who
fails
to
act
reasonably
will
be
vulnerable
to
the
bankruptcy
court
determining
that
it
violated--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--i
would
say
promptly,
and
i
recognize,
your
honor,
your
point
that
the
code
doesn't
spell
out
these
details,
but
this
is
consistent
with
many,
many
aspects
of
bankruptcy
practice
in
the
code
and
the
rules.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
the
amount
permitted
to
be
held
is
to
the
extent
of
the
right
of
setoff.
if
a
bank
holds
too
much,
then
it
violates
the
stay
expressly.
let
me
also
point--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
your
honor,
at
the
time
of
the
hold
the
amount
owed
was
approximately
$3,250.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
yes,
your
honor,
but
given
the
history
of
this
case,
i
would
submit
that
the
bank
didn't
hold
enough,
given
its
right
to
attorney's
fees
as
well,
and
the
bank
held
not
enough
to
cover
the
attorney's
fees
and
accruing
interest.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
part
of
the
proof
of
claim
filed
by
the
bank,
it
was
in
the
computation
of
the
amount
of
setoff,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
ironically
authorized
the
setoff
in
that
amount.
of
course,
it
came
too
late
for
the
bank
because
the
funds
had
been
removed.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
yes,
justice
souter,
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
absent--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--absent
notice,
justice
scalia,
there
could
be
an
issue
as
to
what
exactly
the
bank
did,
what
was
it's
intention,
what
was
the
act.
by
notifying
the
debtor
promptly
that
a
hold
is
in
place
pursuant
to
section
542(b)
pending
the
outcome
of
a
pending
motion
for
leave
from
stay,
there
should
be
no
question
that
the
automatic
stay
has
not
been
violated.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
the
bankruptcy
code
does
not
place
the
onus
of
initiating
the
proceedings
on
either
the
debtor
or
the--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--that
were
possible,
but
i--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--yes,
and
that's
why
i
think--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--that's
why
i
think
the
bank--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--that's...
that's--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--that's
possible,
justice
stevens.
i
think
i
can
clarify
the
issues
the
court
has
identified
by,
let's
take
this
out
of
the
bank-depositor
relationship.
consider
the
bank
as
a
purchaser
of
an
automated
teller
machine,
and
owes
money
to
the
debtor
but
has
a
breach
of
warranty
claim.
no
one
would
suggest
that
the
automatic
stay
mandates
that
the
bank
pay
the
disputed
claim
even
though
it
has
a
complete
defense,
and
consistent
with
that,
a
setoff
right
is
a
complete
defense
under
section
542(b).
if
the
court
were
not
to
agree
with
our
position,
some
results
would
occur
which
i
trust
almost
all
would
agree
are
wrong
results.
for
example,
take
a
landlord
with
a
security
deposit.
when
a
tenant
files
bankruptcy
and
is
delinquent,
is
the
landlord
holding
an
interest
of
the
debtor's?
yes.
it's
funds
in
which
the
debtor
has
an
interest,
but
no
one
i
hope
would
suggest
that
the
landlord
upon
bankruptcy
has
to
give
up
the
very
right
he
bargained
for,
which
is
the
security
deposit.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
i
think,
your
honor,
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
what
usually
occurs
because
bankruptcy
sees
it
many
ways.
many
times,
secured
creditors
will
act
with
great
vigilance
and
speed,
and
oppose
confirmation.
many
times,
creditors
with
security
interests
don't
care
about
a
chapter
13
plan,
and
will
rely
on
their
lien
rights
consistent
with
a
long
body
of
case
law
which
says
those
liens
are
unaffected,
so
i
would
not--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
it
affected
is
whether
the
bank
was
going
to
be
treated
under
the
plan,
and
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
bank
seek
to
have
itself
treated
under
the
plan.
if
the
court
would--
mr.
irving
e.
walker
--no.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
in
chapter
13,
your
honor,
there's
a
section
which
provides
that
the
debtor
is
substituted
for
the
trustee
in
certain
rights,
and
this
would
be
one
of
them.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
with
the
court's
position,
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
respondents
liken
an
administrative
hold
to
seizing
property.
that
is
absolutely
incorrect.
this
court
recognized
in
bank
of
marin
v.
england
that
the
funds
in
the
bank
account
belong
to
the
bank,
not
the
depositor.
when
the
bank
places
an
administrative
hold
on
the
account,
all
it
is
doing
is
simply
refusing
to
pay
its
debt
to
the
depositor
to
the
extent
of
the
right
of
setoff.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
code,
contrary
to
respondent's
position,
to
treat
financial
institutions
worse
than
every
other
class
of
creditors.
maryland
law
certainly
doesn't,
and
the
respondent's
answers
to
this
court's
questions
today
have
been
inconsistent,
depending
on
the
question,
and
the
only
reconciliation
of
those
positions
is
that
financial
institutions
are
not
entitled
to
be
treated,
under
the
code,
like
other
creditors,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
congress
thought
about
financial
institutions
and
the
right
of
setoff,
and
they
wanted
to
preserve
it
for
a
policy
reason.
they
didn't
want
banks
to
act
precipitously
in
anticipation
of
a
possible
bankruptcy
and
by
a
setoff
actually
cause
more
bankruptcies
to
occur.
if
the
lower
court's
decision
is
upheld,
it
would
have
that
effect
of
encouraging
precipitous
action
by
banks.
this
court
recognized
in
studley
v.
boylston
national
bank,
that
the
doctrine
of
setoff
is
based
on
the
absurdity
of
making
a
pay
b
when
b
owes
a.
the
bankruptcy
code
does
not
require
this
court
to
make
that
absurdity
the
law
of
this
land.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
are
the
same.
where
there
are
mutual
debts,
assuming
there
are
mutual
debts,
both
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
bank
would
have
a
right
under
542(b)
to
withhold
payment.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
they
will
be
held
liable
under
section
362(h)
in
an
appropriate
case.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
they
would
be
in
contempt,
subject
to
damages
and
attorney's
fees.
in
fact,
the
irony
in
this
case
is,
after
the
bankruptcy
court
granted
my
client,
citizens
bank,
the
right
to
exercise
its
setoff,
it
was
too
late,
because
the
bank
had
already
been
sanctioned,
and
that's
how
we
got
here.
mr.
irving
e.
walker
that
is
an
interesting
question.
in
my
own
view,
i
would
say
that
if
the
bank
acted
in
good
faith,
the
bankruptcy
court
would
have
the
discretion
not
to
hold
them
in
contempt
of
court,
but
that
would
be
up
to
the
bankruptcy
court
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
if
i
have
any
time
remaining,
i
would
just
respectfully
point
out
that
section
363(a)(3),
which
does
have,
indeed,
broad
language
about
exercising
property
of
the
estate,
does
not
prohibit
a
creditor
from
refusing
to
pay
a
debt
under
section
542(b).
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
