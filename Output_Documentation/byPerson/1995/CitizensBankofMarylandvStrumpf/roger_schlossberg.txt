mr.
roger
schlossberg
justice
stevens,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
hearing
the
argument
of
counsel
just
now,
i'm
struck
that
i
think
what's
being
argued
for
is
a
different
construct
of
a
bankruptcy
code
than
what
congress
intended.
it
seems
like
i'm
hearing
that
we're
supposed
to
have
a
creditor
in
possession,
not
a
debtor
in
possession,
not
a
chapter
13
debtor
in
possession,
but
that
congress
intended
that
the
creditor
is
supposed
to
make
the
determination
as
to
when
he
may
have
a
lien
right
and
as
to
when
that
lien
right
might
well
be
satisfied
by
some
claim
of
setoff
in
some
amount
that
they
think
is
satisfactory
to
satisfy
their
claim.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
your
honor,
two
answers
to
that.
the
one
is
with
respect
to
the
way
that
the
bank
comes
into
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bank
can
come
into
the
bankruptcy
court
under
a
provision
crafted
by
congress.
section
362(f)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
says
they
can
come
in
and
get
ex
parte
relief
from
the
order--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
your
honor,
perhaps
that's
a
possibility.
i
would
suggest,
though,
that
the
bank
has
until
its
midnight
deadline
to
respond.
the
midnight
deadline
is
the
day
after
presentment
of
the
check.
it
does
put
a
burden
on
the
bank,
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
don't
suggest
for
a
moment
that
it
doesn't
put
a
burden
on
the
bank.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
by
no
means,
your
honor.
with
all
due
respect,
what
congress
has
done
in
section
542(b),
it
has
said,
to
the
extent
that
this
may
be
set
off
under
section
553.
this
is
a
tip
that
we're
supposed
to
go
to
553,
and
553
starts
off
and
says,
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
section
and
in
sections
362,
nothing
in
this
title
affects
the
right
of
setoff.
section
362
when
we
go
through
it
says,
you
can't
take
any
right
to
offset.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
it
does
still
give
protection
to
the
bank,
because
it
tells
the
bank
there's
a
way
to
protect
your
right
of
setoff
but
you
have
to
be
vigilant.
congress
made
a
decision
that
there's
two
parties
here,
there's
the
debtor,
there's
the
creditor,
and
somebody's
got
to
be
vigilant
in
here.
someone
has
to
come
into
court
and
ask
their
permission.
the
creditor
cannot
arrogate
to
itself
the
right
to
decide
to
be
its
own
judge
and
jury
as
to
the
validity
of
its
claim
or
the
validity
of
its
setoff.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
but
in
the
meantime,
your
honor,
the
bank
in
this
case,
the
bank
has
denied
to
the
debtor
the
right
to
the
use
of
his
deposits,
and
that--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not
the
final
effectuation
of
the
right
of
the
setoff,
but
it's
certainly
an
interference
with
the
debtor's
right
to
use
his
property--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--during
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
and
in
fact,
that's
what
section
362
says
that
the
court
cannot...
excuse
me,
that
the
creditor
cannot
do.
section
362
gets
pretty
broad
in
its
phrasing.
it
operates
as
a
stay
applicable
to
all
entities
of,
under
subsection
(3),
any
act
to
exercise
control
over
property
of
the
estate,
under
subsection
(6),
any
act
to
collect,
assess
or
recover
a
claim,
or
(7),
or
the
setoff
of
any
debt.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
i
was
looking
at
that
last
night,
your
honor,
trying
to
reconcile
it
for
myself,
and
i
think
it's
just
in
the
drafting,
because
it
says,
the
setoff
of
any
debt--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--that
certainly
is
a
reading
of
the
text,
your
honor,
but
it
can't
ignore
the
reading
of
section
(3),
subsection
(3),
which
says
that
also
proscribed
is
any
act
to
exercise
control
over
property
of
the
estate.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
i
understand
your
honor's
argument.
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
in
norton
looked
to
exactly
this
point,
and
suggested
that
there's
a...
there's
a
trap
in
the
setoff
argument
that
until
the
third
step
is
taken,
that
is,
that
you
actually
note
the
books
to
mark
it
off,
it's
not
really
a
setoff.
now,
norton
was
decided
under
pennsylvania
law,
but
the
court
in
norton
also
said
it's
ridiculous
to
say
that
we
should
wait
around
and
that
a
creditor
can
make
you
wait
until
they
mark
off
the
books,
otherwise
they
could
hold
their
freeze
in
place
forever,
exclusively
within
their
control.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
well,
until
someone
comes
into
court.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
should
the
debtor
have
to
come--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--i
want
the
dough
because
they
have
taken
the
dough
from
me
beforehand
and
said,
i
can't
use
my
property.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
my
apologies.
of
course,
the
debtor
can
certainly
bring
this
issue
to
the
fore.
the
question
is,
did
congress
intend
for
the
debtor
to
have
to
bring
this
to
the
fore
to
use
his
very
own
property?
mr.
roger
schlossberg
your
honor--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--i
would
like
to
explain
why
these
can
be
reconciled
in
the
following
context.
in
the
case
we
have
presented
here
today,
we
have
a
bank
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
government
on
the
other.
let's
just
take
what's
special
about
their
particular
debtor-creditor
relationship,
as
opposed
to
the
garden
variety
contractor
you
were
just
talking
about
a
moment
ago.
in
the
context
of
the
bank,
the
bank
has
a
special
debtor-creditor
relationship.
this
court
determined
what
that
debtor-creditor
relationship
was
back
in
1904
in
the
new
york
county
bank
case
cited
in
petitioner's
brief,
interestingly,
new
york
county
bank
v.
massey.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
relationship
between
the
bank
and
its
depositor
is
as
follows.
the
deposit
of
money
by
a
customer
with
his
banker
is
one
of
loan,
with
the
superadded
obligation
that
the
money
is
to
be
paid
when
demanded
by
a
check.
it's
not
just
your
ordinary
variety
contract.
you
pay
me
when
it's
done,
we
do
what
we
have
to
do.
you
have
to
pay
me
when
i
draw
a
check.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
your--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--if
the
creditor
has
a
special
obliga--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--what
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
if
there
is
a
special
obligation,
an
obligation
by
contract,
an
obligation
implied
by
court,
or
provided
by
statute,
as
in
the
case
of
the
federal
government,
then
in
that
event
you
can't,
you
the
creditor
can't
unilaterally
deny
the
performance
of
that
obligation.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
your
honor,
it
is
a
very
difficult
situation
that
is
presented,
and
it's
presented
in
all
the
cases.
i
don't
suggest
for
a
moment
that
congress
wasn't
presented
with
a
difficult
task
when
they
had
to
decide
who's
going
to
make
this
decision.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
they
in
fact
did,
but
they
said
that
you
have
to
get
relief
from
the
stay
before
you
can
set
off,
and
to
the
extent
that
you
need
it
in
a
particular
case,
you
can
get
ex
parte
relief.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
i
believe
it's
a
matter
of
state
law,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
mr.
walker.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
whole
history
of
setoff
and
bankruptcy.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
this
court's
words.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
yes,
your
honor,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
bank's
right
to
assert
its
secured
claim
by
way
of
setoff
is
conditioned
by
section
362(a)(7),
and
their
right
to
administratively
freeze
beforehand
is
similarly
conditioned
by
section
362(a)(3),
certainly,
and
section
362(a)(6).
mr.
roger
schlossberg
well,
no,
the
bank's
not
on
a
par
with
any
other
creditor,
because
the
bank,
remembering
also
that
any
setting
off
creditor...
any
setting
off
creditor
has
got
a
stepped
up,
a
jumped
up
status
over
any
other
unsecured
creditor.
remembering
that
a
setoff
claim
is,
at
its
very
basis,
nothing
more
than
an
unsecured
claim,
this
is
the
only
unsecured
claim
that
gets
paid
100
cents
on
the
dollar
in
a
bankruptcy
case,
because
it
gets
offset
against
the
claim
that
the
debtor
has
against
that
creditor.
it
gets
paid
100
cents,
and
congress
has
decided
that
there's
a
little
bit
of
an
obligation,
a
little
conditioning,
excuse
me,
that
goes
with
that
right
to
get
100
cents
on
the
dollar
instead
of
dimes
on
the
dollar,
and
that
is,
you've
got
to
come
into
court
first
and
ask
the
court
for
permission
to
take
your
100
cents.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
with...
without
that
clause
involved,
your
honor--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--that
clause
has
a
function
when
brought
before
the
court
in
the
context
of,
let's
take
the
ex
parte
motion
as
suggested
in
patterson.
if
the
ex
parte
motion
is
made,
the
bank
can
say,
i
bring
this
money
in,
i'm
paying
it
into
court
because
i
want
to
offset
it.
i
don't
want
to
have
to
give
it
to
the
debtor
under
section
542.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
that
they
have
the
right
of
setoff?
mr.
roger
schlossberg
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
would--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--provide
that
to
them
as
well.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
well,
i
think
what
it
does,
your
honor...
what
section
542
says
is,
you've
got
to
give
a
debtor
the
property
he
needs
to
operate
his
estate
from
day
one.
we're
trying
to
keep
businesses
going.
we're
trying
to
keep
individual
consumer
debtors,
such
as
david
strumpf,
able
to
make
his
mortgage
payment
and
buy
food,
so
you've
got
to
give
him
his
property
for
this
purpose.
you've
got
to
turn
it
over
to
him,
except
to
the
extent
that
you
may
have
some
other
rights.
go
over
here
and
look
at
section
553.
do
you
have
some
rights
under
section
553?
yes,
i
do
have
some
rights,
but
i
can't
get
those
rights
unless
i
go
and
get
permission
to
exercise
them
first.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
justice--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--well,
section
553
does
not
set
out
any
affirmative
obligation
on
the
bank
to
turn
over
property.
section
553
sets
out
the
bank's
right
to
protect
its
property.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
section
542
without
the
clause
would
say,
you
must
turn
over
property...
all
property
must
be
turned
over
to
the
debtor.
now,
what
congress
is
saying,
reconcile
these
two
clauses
together.
that's
why
that
it's
included,
542
and
553
must
be
reconciled
together.
and
then
again,
congress
has
said,
but
you
can't
read
section
553
in
a
vacuum.
you
have
to
read
it
and
reconcile
it
with
section
362.
by
including
the
last
clause
in
section
542(b),
i
believe
congress
is
directing
that
there
is
a
reconciliation
to
be
made
between
542
and
553,
even
though
they
seem
to
be
reconcilable
if
you
take
the
clause
out.
mr.
roger
schlossberg
section
553
alone,
with
the
inclusion
of
the
introductory
clause--
mr.
roger
schlossberg
--does,
in
fact,
provide
that
protection,
but
the
question
then
becomes,
what
was
the
obligation
of
the
bank
to
turn
over
property?
that
is
then
set
out
in
section
542.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
we
could
resolve
this
issue
without
the
inclusion
of
the
final
clause
in
section
542(b).
i
concede
that.
however,
the
difficulty
in
reconciling
these
provisions
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
that
542...
read
it
with
553,
not
just,
take
this
one
and
we'll
go
see
what
it
conflicts
with.
we've
thought
about
this,
they're
telling
to
the
courts.
congress
is
saying,
we
have
thought
about
this,
and
you
should
bring
these
two
together
and
reconcile
them
in
making
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
permit
a
setoff
in
any
particular
setting.
if
your
honors
have
no
further
questions,
i'll
complete.
thank
you,
your
honor.
