justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
bank
has
still
gone
one
step
beyond
that,
because
the
bank
has
exercised
the
right.
that
is
a
change
in
the
status
quo.
the
bank
has
said,
you
can't
take
the
money
out,
and
it
hadn't
said
that
beforehand.
don't
you...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
i
think
you
have
a
perfectly
reasonable
position.
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
going
to
ultimately
agree
with
it
or
not,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you've
got
to
say
that
the
bank's...
or
concede
that
the
bank's
act
in
instituting
the
freeze
is,
in
fact,
an
act
that
goes
beyond
mere
status
quo.
it's
an
act
which
on
a
literal
reading
offends
some
of
these
statues.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
best
argument
is
to
say,
well,
it
just
offends
them
a
little
bit,
and
it
offends
them
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
make
sense
of
this
equally
valid
statutory
recognition
of
the
right
to
set
off,
that
if
you
don't
allow
this,
the
right
to
set
off
recognized
in
the
code
is
nonsense,
and
try
to
reconcile,
rather
than
to
say,
well,
the
bank
is
absolutely
simon-pure
at
all
times,
and
it
never
literally
violates
a
thing.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
more
plausible
position
than
to
say
that,
here,
for
example,
the
freeze
does
not
affect
the
status
quo.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
be
getting
into
your
shoes,
but--
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
the
ultimate
point
is,
if
the
bank
purports
to...
if
the
bank
freezes
too
much,
if...
in
aid
of
its
claimed
setoff,
it's
simply
going
to
be
found
in
violation
to
that
extent
of
the
stay,
and
it
takes
its
chances.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
it
asks
for
too
much,
it's
going
to
get
in
trouble.
it
may
have
a
lesser
setoff
than
it
thought,
and
it
may
be
in
contempt
with
respect
to
the
difference.
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
in
a
literal
sense,
it
is
any
act,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure.
in
a
literal...
and
you're
saying,
you've
got
to
recognize
a
literal
infraction
to
the
extent
necessary
to
preserve
what
is
obviously
intended
elsewhere
to
be
a
recognition
of
the
setoff
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
grant
you.
in
other
words,
it
can
literally
fall
within
the
term,
and
still
not
be
a
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not
doing
so.
i
mean,
it
is
putting
itself
in
a
position
in
which
validity
will
be
determined
when
the
time
comes
to
adjudicate
a
request
to
lift
the
stay.
that's
when
validity
is
determined.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
yes,
but
it
is
not
a
final
determination
of
validity.
it
is
not
the
equivalent
of
the
final
effectuation
of
the
setoff
by
any
means.
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely.
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
curious,
isn't
it,
that
the
setoff
under
(7)
doesn't
have
the
any
act
provision,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is
in
the
drafting,
but
the
drafting
occurs
in
a
series
in
which
it
presents
a
definite
contrast,
and
it
would
suggest
that
perhaps
any
act
to
effectuate
the
setoff
is
not
meant
to
be
prohibited
in
the
same
sense
that
any
act
in
these
other
contexts
are
meant
to
be
prohibited.
that's
a
reading
of
the
text,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely.
absolutely,
but
if
you're
going
to
read
the
sections
together,
which
is
what
we
have
to
do
in
construing
statutes,
there's
a
pretty
darn
good
argument
to
say
there
that
any
act
necessary
but
not
conclusive
of
effectuating
the
setoff
is
not
necessarily
prohibited.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
not
if
you
can
get
into
court.
of
course
they
can't
hold
the
freeze
in
place
forever.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
you
can
go
into
court
and
say,
i
want
the
dough.
justice
david
h.
souter
absolutely,
but
i'm
simply
responding
to
your
statement
that
in
fact
the
bank's
autonomous
act
could
endure,
in
effect,
indefinitely.
it
can't
endure
indefinitely.
there
is
a
way
of
reconciling
these
two
competing
kinds
of
claims.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
they
be
in
contempt
if
they
acted
in
good
faith,
i
mean,
they
just
happened
to
be
wrong?
