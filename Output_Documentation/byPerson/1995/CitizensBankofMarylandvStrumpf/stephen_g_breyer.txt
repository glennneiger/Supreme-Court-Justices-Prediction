justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
side
issue,
the
side
issue
being
the
state
or
federal
law.
i'd
worry
about
having
federal
law
here
simply
because
you
start
defining
the
word
setoff
in
this
provision
under
federal
law,
it
will
have
a
spillover
to
other
provisions,
where
surely
it
should
be
state.
all
the
other
things
like
liens
are
state,
the
bankruptcy
code's
property
definitions
are
primarily
state,
and
so
why
should
we
start
saying
it's
federal
when
it
sort
of
mucks
up
the
code,
particularly
when
you
don't
need
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
you'd
be
parsing
one
thing
out
of
362,
where
all
of
the
other
property
definitions
are
state,
suddenly
call
this
one
federal,
and
the
word
setoff
appears
throughout
the
rest
of
the
code,
and
you'd
say,
oh,
those
are...
i
mean,
those
are
state,
too,
and
we
don't
need
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
claim
is
basically
that
banks
and
other
people
like
landlords
have
to
be
able
to
keep
the
property
temporarily,
not
pay
the
debt
temporarily,
until
they
can
run
in
and
get
the
automatic
stay
lifted,
otherwise,
as
happened
here,
the
person
will
run
to
the
bank
and
he'll
withdraw
all
the
money,
and
that's
the
last
they'll
ever
see
of
it.
that's
basically
their
argument.
they
say
if
the
word
setoff
means
anything,
they
have
to
have
at
least
a
temporary
freeze,
otherwise
it's
meaningless.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
takes
more
than
an
hour,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
and
so
during
that
hour,
the
guy
runs
in
and
takes
all
the
money
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
that
is
the
serious
question
to
me,
anyway,
in
this
case,
is
it's
not
just
banks,
or
even
just
landlords.
anybody,
anybody
might
owe
money
to
a
bankrupt
company.
you
might,
i
might,
we
get
bills
every
month,
and
i
refuse
to
believe,
at
least
so
far,
that
if
the
company
goes
bankrupt
i
have
to
pay
my
bill
no
matter
what,
even
if
i
think
they
didn't
deliver
the
merchandise.
i
mean,
i
refuse
to
believe
that
the
ordinary
person
who
owes
somebody
some
money
but
has
a
claim
against
that
same
person
suddenly
has
to
write
out
the
check
and
pay
it
just
because
the
debtor
went
bankrupt.
that's
why
they
put
the
word
offset
in
here.
that's
why
you
have
an
offset.
so
we're
trying
to
reconcile
these
provisions,
and
it
would
help
me
if
you'd
explain
why
they
just
can't
be
reconciled.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
other
side
is
telling
us
congress
didn't
decide
that.
they're
saying
congress
decided
a
different
thing,
which
is
quite
simple,
that
reconciles
it.
they
say
if
the
bank
or
the
landlord
or
you
or
i
are
simply
not
offsetting,
which
requires
an
intent
to
deprive
the
person
permanently
of
the
money,
but
rather
are
simply
holding
it
administratively
until
such
a
determination
can
be
made,
that
does
not
fit
within
state
law
setoff,
and
that's
what
this
code
is
after,
and
they
say
that
reconciles
it.
you
give
notice
to
show
that
your
intent
is
not
to
deprive
the
person
permanently
of
the
money,
your
intent
is
simply
to
see
that
the
administrative
determination
is
made,
and
that's
how
they've
come
in
and
argued
this.
now,
that's...
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
focus
on
that
more
than
on,
you
know,
the
general
language
here,
which
i
think
is
ambiguous.
i
will
concede,
your
honor,
that
the
general...
the
language
in
all
these
statutes
we're
talking
about
are
difficult
to
reconcile.
if
i
may
just
address
one
part
of
your
question
there,
you
mentioned
again
the
security
deposits,
and
i
think
i'd
be
remiss
if
i
didn't
point
out
why
this
is
particularly
a
red
herring.
a
security
deposit
is
a
deposit
in
which
the
debtor
does
not
have
immediate
rights.
the
debtor
doesn't
have
the
immediate
right
to
get
back
his
security
deposit.
it's
held
as
security.
it's
locked
up.
it's
just
like
the
secured
credit
card
that's
argued
in
the
brief
of
one
of
the
amicus
counsel,
one
of
the
bank
counsel
who
have
argued
that
they
have
a
secured
credit
card,
and
that
if
you
rule
in
favor
of
david
strumpf
in
this
case,
you
will
somehow
undermine
their
ability
to
give
secured
credit
cards.
the
difference
is,
again,
that
security
deposit
put
up
to
the
landlord,
put
up
to
the
bank
for
the
secured
credit
card,
does
not
have
in
it
any
right
of
the
debtor
to
take
the
money
out
at
any
time
to
draw
on
it
by
a
check.
that's
why
that
is
not
the
same
kind
of
situation
as
is
presented
where,
with
citizens
bank,
they
have
a
superadded
obligation
to
honor
my
checks
when
drawn,
or,
in
the
instance
of
the
federal
government,
when
it
has
a
statutory
obligation
to
refund
overpayments
made
back
to
the
taxpayer.
now,
your
garden
variety
creditor,
the
guy
on
a
contract,
the
two...
manufacturer
you
just
talked
about
and
his
vendee,
do
not
have
that
same
situation.
there
is
not
a
superadded
obligation.
there
is
not
a
statutory
imposition
of
an
obligation
to
make
a
payment
on
a
date
certain.
now,
that
i
see
as
a
very
important
distinction
and
difference
between
the
two
situations.
your
honor,
i
submit
that
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
something
of
an
alice-in-wonderland
scenario.
the
suggestion
is
made
here,
sentence
first,
verdict
afterwards.
we'll
seize
the
property
first,
then
we'll
figure
out
if
we
have
an
entitlement
to
it.
that's
not
what
congress
intended.
congress
set
up
a
scheme
for
taking
this
theory
of
setoff
under
consideration.
it's
a
careful
scheme.
it's
one
which
requires
a
creditor
to
come
into
the
bankruptcy
court
and
seek
relief
from
the
stay,
ex
parte
if
necessary,
get
that
relief,
and
then
take
the
action
that
they're
entitled
to
take.
could
you
tell
me
what...
how
the
bankruptcy
act
would
have
a
different
effect
from
the
effect
that
you
say
it
now
has
if
section
542(b),
the
last
portion
of
it,
were
eliminated,
except
to
the
extent
that
such
debt
may
be
offset
under
section
553
of
this
title.
suppose
that
were
just
totally
eliminated.
would
not
the
bankruptcy
act
do,
without
that,
exactly
what
you
say
it
does
with
it?
