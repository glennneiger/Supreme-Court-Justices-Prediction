mr.
walker,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
in
comparing
what
this
freeze
is
to
what
a
setoff
is
that
a
freeze,
a
temporary
hold,
is
to
a
setoff
what
a
tro
is
to
a
permanent
injunction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
administrative
hold
or
freeze,
as
you
say
that
there
is
under
the
statute,
wouldn't
one
expect
to
find
some
auxiliary
rules
governing
it?
it
is...
it
does
have
the
drastic
consequence
of
preventing
the
accountholder
from
cashing
checks.
since
it
does
have
that
consequence,
wouldn't
one
expect
the
statute
to
say,
but
bank,
if
you
do
this,
you've
got
to
give
the
debtor
immediate
notice
that
you're
doing
it
so
he
won't
write
checks
that
won't
be
cashed,
you
have
to
tell
the
court
that
you're
doing
it,
and
get
the
confirmation
of
the
setoff
as
soon
as
possible?
but
there's
nothing.
there's
nothing
that
tells
us
what
conditions
govern
this
hold.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
tell
me--
--i
thought
that
was
part
of
a
turnover
proceeding.
that's
just
when
there's
a
turnover...
or
am
i
incorrect
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
can
we
go
back
to
these...
tell
me
when
the
bank
has
a
hold,
or
a
freeze,
must
it
immediately
notify
the
debtor
and
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
should.
isn't
it
must
it?
is
there
an
obligation
to...
how
do
we
know
anything
about
the
notice
requirement?
where
do
we
get
it
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
there
are
none
because
this
animal
of
a
freeze
or
a
hold
is
not
part
of
state
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
so
you
can't
answer
my
question,
other
than
to
say
yes,
it
should
notify
the
debtor.
in
what
period
of
time,
immediately,
the
next
day,
the
day
after?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
how
much
could
be
frozen?
it
was
a
dispute
about
whether
too
much
was
frozen
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
walker,
there's
something
in
the
background
of
this
case
i
don't
understand,
and
maybe
you
can
explain
it
to
me.
what
is
the
standard
operating
procedure
for
banks
in
these
situations?
they
get
notice
of
the
bankruptcy
filing.
the
debtor,
as
i
understood
it,
listed
the
bank
as
an
unsecured
creditor.
the
bank
apparently
did
nothing
until
after
there
was
a
confirmed
plan.
is
that
how
it
usually
occurs,
that
for,
what
was
it,
8
months
here,
the
bank
says
absolutely
nothing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
didn't
matter
that
the
bank
was
listed
as
an
unsecured
creditor.
since
that
was
not,
in
fact,
the
case,
the
bank
could
safely
ignore
it,
that
characterization.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
debtor,
the
effect
is
the
same.
you're
describing
differences
in
accounting,
in
bookkeeping,
for
how
you
mark
the
setoff
as
a
permanent
one,
but
from
the
debtor's
point
of
view
it
means,
i
have
no
access
to
this
account.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
walker,
do
you
distinguish
the
position
of
the
bank
in
any
way
from
the
position
that
mr.
estrada
was
representing?
that
is,
the
position
of
the
irs
that
has...
where
the
taxpayer
is
due
a
refund,
but
on
the
other
hand
is
alleged
to
owe
the
government
money?
