mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
justice
stevens,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
bankruptcy
code
expressly
preserves
a
creditor's
right
of
setoff,
but
section
362
of
the
code
stays
its
exercise
pending
an
orderly
determination
of
the
debtor's
and
creditor's
rights.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
this
case
to
conclude
that
the
bank
exercised
its
right
of
setoff
and
thereby
violated
section
362
when
it
froze
respondent's
bank
account
pending
a
judicial
determination
of
its
rights.
that
freeze
was
simply
a
refusal
to
pay
a
contract
debt
that
was
consistent
with
the
language
and
the
purpose
of
the
automatic
stay,
and
in
our
view,
any
other
conclusion
in
this
case
would
render
the
right
of
a
setoff
meaningless.
let
me
start
with
the
language
of
362(a)(7)
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied.
a
freeze
is
not
a
setoff
under
that
provision,
because
subsection
(a)(7)
stays
the
setoff
of
a
prepetition
debt.
by
using
the
word
setoff
without
further
definition,
congress
must
have
intended
to
use
the
word
in
its
ordinary
common
law
meaning,
which
is...
which
is
one
that
requires
an
overt
act
in
order
to
cancel
the
competing
balances,
and
that
results
in
the
record
of
that
event.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
our
view
in
this
case
would
be
entirely
identical,
justice
stevens,
because
in
our
view
for
purposes--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
for
purposes
of
section
362
at
least,
we
think
it
should
and
is
a
matter
of
federal
law,
and
let
me
sort
of
get
into
that
a
little
bit.
there
is
no
question
that
the
right
that
is
reserved
by
the
code
as
a
substantive
matter
under
section
553
is
one
that
is
not
conferred
by
bankruptcy
law
but
it
is
dependent
in
some
underlying
sorts
of
law
that
may
be
federal
or
state.
in
the
cases
in
which
we
deal,
it
will
usually
be
a
federal
right,
either
because
of
a
statute
or
because
of
federal
common
law.
but
for
purposes
of
the
stay,
the
language
that
congress
chose
indicates
that
congress
was
intending
to
cover
certain
classes
of
conduct
that
were
pretty
much
to
be
covered
uniformly,
and
it
cannot
be,
for
example,
that
a
state
that
has
a
quirky
law
like
the...
like
pennsylvania
had
in
one
of
the
reported
cases,
for
example,
saying
that
there
was
an
automatic
setoff,
that
that
would
result
in
the
violation
of
a
stay
without
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
creditor
as
a
matter
of
law.
as
used
in
section
362,
it
seems
to
me
more
sensible
to
read
the
language
in
its
ordinary
legal
sense,
and
therefore,
until
and
unless
a
creditor
takes
some
affirmative
act
to
credit
and
debit
the
offsetting
balances
and
to
make
a
record
of
that
event,
a
setoff
has
not
occurred.
by
contrast,
a
freeze,
like
the
stay
itself,
merely
maintains
the
status
quo
by
conserving
the
offsetting
balances
in
the
same
state
until
there
is
a
judicial
determination
of
the
party's
rights.
so
it
may
well
be
that
in
some
sense
the
freeze
itself
is
an
affirmative
act,
but
it's
not
one
that
is
an
affirmative
act
in
the
sense
that
is
relevant
here.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
may
well
be,
but
we
don't
think
that
that
controls
the
interpretation
of
section
362,
justice
ginsburg,
because--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--oh,
what
it
does
is
to
try
to
keep
creditors
from
taking
affirmative
acts
to
improve
their
status
vis-a-vis
the
other
creditors,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
no,
because
what
362
does
not
do,
justice
scalia,
is
that
it
is
not
a
section
for
the
turnover
or
payover
of...
for
the
turnover
of
property
or
the
payover
of
debts.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
a
different
section
of
the
statute
would
have
no
point,
because
section
542
deals
specifically
with
the
circumstances
under
which
a
creditor
must
turn
over
property
to
the
debtor,
or
to
pay
over
debts.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
as
to
(4),
it
is
not
really
an
act
in
the
chain
of
enforcement
of
a
lien
as
such.
it
is
not
like
the
bank
purporting
to
have
a
judicial
sale
of
any
sort
of
property
claimed
by
the
debtor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
because
the
lien
was
created
as
a
matter
of
law
by
section
506(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
gives--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--under
section
(a)(6),
our
answer
would
be
that
as
a
matter
of
the
structure
of
the
code,
justice
kennedy,
it
cannot
be
that
where
the
act
simply
is
one
of
refusal
to
capitulate
to
a
debtor's
assertion
of
rights
and
property
that
that's
covered
by
the
state,
because
it
would
be
entirely
alien
to
our
system
for
congress
to
have
intended
that
anyone
who's
faced
with
a
demand
by
a
debtor
to
property
that
is
disputed
most
fold
his
tents
and
go
home,
and
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
any
act.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
agree
with
the
first
part
of
your
statement,
justice
souter,
but
not
the
second.
it
is
true
that
it
is
any
act.
however,
the
relevant
question
is
whether
it
is
an
act
that
violates
the
automatic
stay,
and
that--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
can
literally
fall
within
a
clause
of
the
automatic
stay,
but
that
does
not
resolve
the
question
whether
the
rest
of
that
section,
read
in
light
of
the
other
applicable
sections
of
the
code,
indicate
that
that
isolated
act
was
meant
to
be
covered
by
the
language.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
it
is
conceded
by
the
parties
that
the
debt
is
property
of
the
estate.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
not
within
the
intended
meaning
of
that
section,
justice
stevens.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
and
the
answer--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
you
do
not,
because
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
timbers
of
inward
forest,
the
question
is
not
whether
one
of
the
lines
or
subsections
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
read
in
isolation,
might
lend
credence
to
a
claim
under
the
code,
but
whether
that
is
a
reading
that
makes
sense
in
light
of
the
code
as
a
whole.
and
the
plain
meaning
rule
is
not
a
rule
of
reading
isolated
sentences
in
a
statute,
it
is
a
rule
of
reading
the
code
in
its
entirety,
and
our
submission
here
is
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
all
a
creditor
has
done
is
to
refuse
to
capitulate
to
a
debtor's
assertion
of
rights
and
property
so
that
he
may
present
a
defense
to
a
proper
legal
forum,
the
other
provisions
of
the
code,
the
entire
structure
of
the
law
makes
the
reading
that
respondent
suggests
implausible.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
as
i
said,
because
in
the
context
of
362,
that
would
make
sense.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
except
that
as
used
in
section
362,
the
word
setoff
is
not
used
to
describe
property
but
to
describe
conduct,
and
in
that
context
it
makes
sense
to
deal
with
a
uniform
federal
definition,
justice
breyer.
thank
you.
