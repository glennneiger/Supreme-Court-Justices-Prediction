justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
status
quo
was
changed
here.
the
bankrupt
was
able
to
withdraw
funds
before
the
bank's
action
in
freezing
the
account.
thereafter,
the
account
was
frozen.
isn't
that
a
change
in
the
status
quo?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
i
thought
you
said
that
whether
a
setoff
has
occurred
depends
upon
whether
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
status
quo,
that
there
has
to
be
some
change
in
the
status
quo.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
i'm
saying
is
that
that
factor
existed
here,
didn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--let
me--
--why
are
you
willing
to
assume
that
the
bank
has
to
notify?
what
would
happen
if
the
bank
didn't
notify?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
burden
were
all...
you
know,
if
you
think
the
debt
is
owing,
you
demand
it,
and
at
that
point
you
find
out
whether
there's
a
claimed
setoff
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
reference
to
362,
what
does
362
conceivably
achieve,
then?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
the
only
affirmative
act
that
they
care
about
is
not
paying
the
money.
isn't
that...
and
that's
achieved
this
way
as
effectively
as
by
doing
what
you
call
a
full
dress
setoff.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
do
you
do
with
section
542(b)?
you
talk
about
the
intent
of
congress.
doesn't
congress
seem
to
want
to
preserve
the
ability
of
individuals
to
use
setoff
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
ability
is
totally
eliminated
if
you
don't
allow
this
temporary
freeze.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
give
me
an
explanation
that,
i
mean,
it
makes
sense,
what
should
i
say,
physically,
but
you
might
as
well
not
have
542(b)
if
you're
going
to
follow
that
track.
what
good
does
542(b)
do
you?
you
tell
me,
essentially,
none.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
function,
in
other
words,
that
you
assert
that
clause
has?
justice
antonin
scalia
553
would
achieve
that
purpose,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it
would,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore,
i
don't
see
anything
that
this
except
clause
does
unless
it
does
what
the
petitioner
here
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
a
turnover
provision.
it
says,
you
don't
have
to
turn
over
except...
it
has
that
except
clause,
and
you're
saying,
even
with
the
except
clause,
you
have
to
turn
over.
your
only
protection
is,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
if
you've
brought
it
before
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
proper
fashion,
you
will
be
allowed
your
setoff.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
achieve
that,
all
you
need
is
section
553.
you
do
not
need
this
special
protection
in
the
except
clause
of
542(b).
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
would
be
no
need
for
reconciliation,
because
once
you've
gone
in
and
had
the
automatic
stay
to
the
extent
that
it
operates
against
the
setoff
eliminated,
there's
nothing
more
to
be
done.
you
don't...
it
seems
to
me
you
don't
need
542(b),
because
then
the
provision
of
543
that
has
a
prologue,
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
362,
it
would
no
longer
apply.
362
would
be
no
longer
applicable.
you've
gotten
the
stay
eliminated
insofar
as
your
ability
to
set
off
is
concerned.
362
has
no
application,
and
therefore
you're
entitled
to
assert
your
setoff.
all
of
that
is
achieved
by
section
553
alone.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
mr.
walker,
you
have
about
2
or
3
minutes
remaining,
about
3
minutes.
