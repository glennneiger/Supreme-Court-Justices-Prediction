mr.
walker,
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
your
definition
is
of
a
setoff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
a
matter
of
federal
law
or
state
law
for
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
look
to
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
overall
federal
meaning
of
that
term
for
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
this
instance,
you
think
that
it
depends
on
the
bank's
intention?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
walker,
there's
nothing
in
the
code
that
requires
notification,
and
i
assume
that
under
the
scheme
as
you
envision
it,
the
bankruptcy
code
creates
a
sort
of
temporary
stalemate
in
order
to
enable
a
creditor
having
a
right
of
setoff,
a
potential
right
of
setoff,
to
take
the
action
to
effectuate
it,
and
maybe
the
burden
is
on
the
debtor
to
file
for
a
turnover
order
with
the
bank
to
get
the
bank
to
turn
over
any
moneys
being
held,
and
maybe
that's
how
the
issue
comes
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
rule
that
you're
advocating
is
somehow
different
if
the
creditor
asserting
some
potential
setoff
is
not
a
bank?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
different
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
be
the
same
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
why
isn't
the
goal
of
the
bankruptcy
code
here
best
achieved
by
creating
a
stalemate
until
this
issue
of
right
to
setoff
is
properly
before
the
bankruptcy
court?
you
have
to
be
able
to
create
a
temporary
stalemate
so
that
the
bankruptcy
court
gets
to
decide
it,
otherwise
it's
too
late.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
made
a
decision.
they
tried
to
protect
the
right
of
setoff.
i
don't
think
it's
that
difficult.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
wasn't
a
setoff,
as
yet.
who
provides
the
definition
of
setoff
here,
the
state
or
the
federal
government?
