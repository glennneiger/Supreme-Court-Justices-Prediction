justice
john
paul
stevens
we'll
hear
argument
in
case
number
94-1340,
citizens
bank
of
maryland
v.
strumpf.
mr.
walker,
you
can
proceed
when
you're
ready.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
did
in
this
case,
then,
it
violated
the
stay
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
held...
withheld...
it
put
a
hold
on
more
than
the
amount
of
the
offset,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
hold
was
$3,500.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
other
words
the
debtor
just
writes
a
check,
and
when
it
bounces
he
should
come
in.
he
doesn't
find
out
until
the
check
bounces.
is
that
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
that
be
normally
what
would
happen,
if
you
didn't
tell
him
there
was
a
hold
on
the
account?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
you
think
a
bank
ought
to
give
him
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understood
you
in
effect
to
say
that
although
the
hold
itself
is
not
a
contempt
of
court
or
a
violation,
if
he
just...
if
the
bank
puts
a
hold
on
and
then
keeps
its
mouth
closed
for
30
days
or
more,
it
might
well
ripen
into
a
contempt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
thought
was
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
estrada.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
estrada,
what
would
your
view
be
if
maryland
passed
a
statue
that
said,
an
administrative
hold
shall
be
a
"setoff"
as
a
matter
of
maryland
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
setoff
is
defined
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
estrada,
i
think
it's
even...
your
argument
is
even
stronger
with
respect
to
subparagraph
(3),
to
exercise
control
over
property
of
the
estate,
because
the
debt
is
property
of
the
estate,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
not
agree
that
the
freeze
is
an
exercise
of
control
over
that
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
have
to
depart
somewhat
from
the
plain
language,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schlossberg.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you,
mr.
walker.
the
case
is
submitted.
