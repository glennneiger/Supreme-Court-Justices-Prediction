justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
justice
ginsburg's
point
was
you're
asking
us
to
establish
a
mechanism
that
does
not
have
specific
grounding
in
the
statute.
i
assume
under
your
freeze
theory
that
you
would
say
the
bank
has
to
notify
the
trustee
within
a
reasonable
time,
he
has
to
notify
the
bankrupt,
i
suppose
it
can
freeze
no
more
than
is
necessary
to
cover
what
it
reasonably
thinks
is
the
setoff...
this
is
a
very
sensible
theory,
but
i
think
justice
ginsburg's
question
was
directed
to,
where
is
its
grounding
in
the
code?
and
you
refer
to
542,
but
i
thought
that
was
when
there
was
a
turnover
proceeding.
maybe
i...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
attorney's
fees
part
of
the
setoff?
is
that
a
liquidated
debt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
question
that,
it's...
probably
you
can
answer
it
easily.
542(b)
that
you
refer
us
to
says
that
an
entity
that
owes
a
debt
must
pay
the
debt
to
the
trustee.
the
bank
didn't
have
the
obligation
to
pay
the
balance
of
this
account
to
the
trustee
right
away,
did
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
why
does
this...
i
don't
see
how
this
section
enters
in.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
theory,
before
you
get
to
that
section,
why
wouldn't
the
bank
be
violating
the
automatic
stay
provisions
of
(4),
which
is
any
act
to
create
or
perfect
or
enforce
a
lien,
or
(6),
any
act
to
collect,
assess,
or
recover
a
claim?
these
are
also
just
incipient,
inchoate,
incomplete
acts,
and
so
they
don't...
they're
not
prohibited
by
those
particular
sections.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
creating...
it's
not
creating
the
lien
by
the
freeze?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
now
that's
(6),
any
act
to
collect
or
assess--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
and
it's
the
same
thing
justice
o'connor's
touching
on,
suppose
you
have
this
wholesaler
and
retailer,
and
they
present...
they
have
accounts
going
back
and
forth
all
the
time
for
returned
goods
and
so
forth,
i
take
it
from
your
earlier
answer
that
if
the
wholesaler
owes,
that
has
an
offset
and
the
retailer
goes
bankrupt,
the
wholesaler
can...
need
not
need
to
pay
the
retailer's
bill
for
returned
merchandise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now,
the
bank
is
different,
because
it
has
a
superadded
obligation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
pay,
but
does...
that
superadded
obligation
is
also
defined
by
reference
to
the
bank's
right
to
assert
its
secured
claim,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
we're
right
back
where
we're
started.
i'm
not
sure
what
in
the
code
gives
the
bank...
puts
the
bank
in
any
worse
position,
and
then
you
cite
the
supreme
court
case,
and
then
i
say,
well,
of
course
there's...
that's
subject
to
the
setoff,
and
you
say,
well,
the
setoff
is
controlled
by
362,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
puts
the
bank
just
on
a
par
with
any
other
creditor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
theory
of
the
case
and
the
interpretation,
what
happens
if
the
bank
is
wrong
about
its
setoff?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
they
be
in
contempt?
