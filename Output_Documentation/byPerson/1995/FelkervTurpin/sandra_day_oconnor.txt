mr.
monaghan,
what
about
jurisdiction
in
this
court
under
the
all
writs
act
by
way
of
writ
of
mandamus,
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
either.
how
does
the
act
affect
that,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
boleyn,
your
interpretation
of
the
new
law,
and
your
position
that
2241
is
effectively
repealed,
differs
from
that
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
exactly
is
it
that
the
court
would
be
reviewing
under
its
original
habeas
jurisdiction?
is
it,
in
fact;
some
kind
of
appellate
review,
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--would
we
be
reviewing
the
denial
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
permission
to
file
a
successive
petition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
so
are
you
changing
your
answer
to
my
question?
what
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
last
case
i
have
to
announce
is
on
behalf
of
the
chief
justice.
it
is
the
case
of
felker
versus
turpin,
no.
95-8836.
the
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
in
georgia
of
murder
and
was
sentence
to
death.
he
first
challenged
his
conviction
and
sentence
in
state
court
but
was
denied
relief.
he
then
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
federal
court
and
that
petition
was
denied
earlier
this
term.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
petitioner’s
subsequent
efforts
to
obtain
relief
from
his
death
sentence
in
the
federal
court
and
with
the
effect
on
those
efforts
of
the
federal
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996
which
was
signed
into
law
on
april
24
of
this
year.
the
act
places
new
limitations
on
the
ability
of
the
state
prisoners
like
the
petitioner
to
seek
federal
relief
for
the
filing
of
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
petition.
section
106(b)(1)
of
the
act
bars
a
petitioner
from
raising
claims
in
a
successive
federal
habeas
petition
if
the
claims
have
already
been
raised
in
a
prior
petition
and
section
106(b)(2)
of
the
act
requires
tight
restrictions
on
a
successive
petitioner’s
ability
to
raise
claims
that
have
not
been
previously
raised.
in
addition
to
the
substantive
restrictions
on
the
filing
of
successive
habeas
petitions,
the
act
also
creates
a
new
gatekeeping
procedure
whereby
a
petitioner
seeking
to
file
a
successive
habeas
petitioner
in
federal
district
court
must
first
obtain
authorization
for
the
filing
from
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
act
instructs
the
courts
of
appeals
to
grant
such
authorization
if
the
petitioner
has
made
a
prima
facie
showing
that
it
satisfies
the
substantive
requirements
for
filing
a
successive
petition.
the
act
also
provides
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
whether
to
grant
authorization
for
the
filing
of
a
successive
petition
shall
not
be
appealable
and
that
it
shall
not
be
the
subject
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
after
the
act
was
signed
in
the
law
and
shortly
before
his
scheduled
execution,
petitioner
sought
relief
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
file
a
second
habeas
corpus
petition
in
federal
court.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
petitioner
had
not
made
the
requisite
prima
facie
showing
and
denied
him
leads
to
file.
petitioner
then
filed
in
this
court
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
with
these
filings,
petitioner
sought
first
review
of
the
court
of
appeals'
authorization
decision
and
second
review
on
the
merits
of
his
underlying
challenges
to
its
conviction
and
sentence.
we
stayed
the
petitioner’s
execution
and
granted
certiorari
to
determine
what
effect
the
new
act
has
on
our
jurisdiction
to
review
petitioner’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
as
habeas
corpus
petition
and
to
consider
two
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
new
act.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
the
chief
justice,
we
conclude
that
the
act
does
not
remove
our
jurisdiction
to
entertain
original
habeas
petitions,
but
it
does
not
unconstitutionally
restrict
our
appellate
jurisdiction
and
then
it
does
not
work
an
unlawful
suspension
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
act
limits
the
power
of
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals
to
consider
successive
habeas
petitions.
but
our
decision
in
ex
parte
yerger
many
years
ago
makes
clear
that
repeal
of
our
habeas
jurisdiction
by
implication
is
not
favored
and
we
find
nothing
in
the
act
that
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
curtail
our
power
to
entertain
original
habeas
petition
like
the
one
that
petitioner
filed
here.
this
conclusion
obviates
any
constitutional
challenge
under
the
exceptions
clause
of
article
ii
section
2
to
the
successive
petition
limitations
of
the
act.
we
conclude
the
act
does
not
violate
the
suspension
clause
of
article
i
section
9
of
the
constitution
because
the
new
restrictions
on
successive
petitions
constitute
a
modified
res
judicata
rule.
we
said
in
mccleskey
versus
zant
that
the
doctrine
of
abuse
of
the
writ
refers
to
a
complex
in
abounding
body
of
equitable
principles
informed
and
controlled
by,
among
other
things,
statutory
developments.
the
act’s
new
restrictions
are
well
within
the
compass
of
this
evolutionary
process.
these
findings
lead
us
to
conclude
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
turning
to
the
original
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
petitioner
filed
here,
we
conclude
that
the
petitioner’s
claims
did
not
satisfy
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
act
let
alone
the
requirement
of
our
own
rule
20.4(a)
that
a
habeas
petitioner
show
exceptional
circumstances
justifying
the
issuance
of
the
writ.
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
thus
denied.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
souter
and
breyer
have
joined;
justice
souter
