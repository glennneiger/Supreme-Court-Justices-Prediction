justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
take
it
your
theory
of...
that
sort
of
neutralizes
the
warden's
complaint
is
not
merely
that
there
is
an
asymmetry
in
the
very
structure
of
habeas
practice,
but
that
the
result
of
the
probable
cause
determination
when
it
goes
against
the
warden
ultimately
is
merged
in
what
happens
in
the
district
court,
and
it's
like
many
preliminary
orders
that
are
merged
before
any
ultimate
review
takes
place.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
mean
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2)?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought
the
government
was
taking
this
position,
that
our
review
is
appellate
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii
original,
but
that
it
is
an
original
proceeding
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
proceeding
before
us
in
the
first
instance,
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
it
is
treated
in
that
way,
we
could
consider
as
an
evidentiary
matter
what
may
be
on
the
record
below,
even
though
we
are
not,
in
the
conventional
sense,
reviewing
that
record
on
an
appellate
process.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
isn't
it
the
case
that
we
might
well
be
bound
by
the
substance
of
the
act
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2),
but
we
are
not,
in
terms,
bound
by
the
prima
facie
case
showing,
which
applies
only
in
courts
of
appeals
and
district
courts?
that's
a
possible
reading
of
the
act,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
not
what
the
act
says.
i
mean,
the
act...
that
portion
of
the
act
applies
by
its
own
terms--
justice
david
h.
souter
--only
to
the
relationship
between
district
and
courts
of
appeals,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
he
shouldn't
be
able...
i
take
it
it's
your
position
he
should
not
be
able
to
invoke
that
original
extraordinary
jurisdiction,
as
you
put
it,
for
any
purpose
that
would
result
in
his
getting
substantive
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
are
saying
the
only
thing
he
can
litigate
under
that
jurisdiction
is
jurisdiction
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
you
win
on
that
point,
in
fact
there
will
never
be
again
an
extraordinary
case
in
which
this
court
might
invoke
its
original
jurisdiction
to
review
the
particularities
of
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
means...
i
mean,
the
practical
effect
of
that,
them,
is
that
our
original
jurisdiction
is,
in
fact,
gone.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
if
you're
allowing
that,
what
happens
to
your
argument
that
we
ought
to
construe
or
ought
to
find
an
implication?
it
cuts
our
2241
power
even
more
narrowly.
i
mean,
by
its
terms,
the
act
doesn't
do
that,
and
you're
saying,
well,
you
ought
to
do
it
because,
in
effect,
it
would
give
effect
to
the
act.
you
don't
want
to
make
end
runs
around
what
congress
intended.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
fact,
on
your
view,
something
like
that
is
allowed
if
we
exercise
a
mandamus
jurisdiction,
so
why
shouldn't
we
construe,
even
on
your
view,
our
2241
jurisdiction
at
least
that
broadly?
justice
david
h.
souter
2241
doesn't
sound
extraordinary
enough.
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
i
mean,
that
sounds
like
mandamus,
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you're
saying
even
as
an
extraordinary
remedy,
your
answers
to
justice
breyer,
justice
ginsburg
and
me
made
it
very
clear
that
under
2241,
save
for
in
the
narrow
sense,
jurisdictional
litigation,
2241
no
longer,
on
your
view,
gives
us
power
to
do
anything.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
under
2241?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
under
mandamus.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
don't
you
take
the
position
that
we
should
construe
those
avenues
as
equally
barred
in
the
spirit
of
this
new
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
said...
i
thought
you
left
a
place
for
mandamus,
and
you
left
a
place
for
the
exercise
of
the
all
writs
act,
which
i
guess--
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what
it
means
is,
it
is
appellate
in
the
article
iii
sense
because
it
can't
be
original.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
is
original
in
the
sense
that
it
is
going
to
the
merits
of
the
habeas
claim
rather
than
to
the
specific
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
no
prima
facie
case
was
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
would
suppose
that
in
making
that
determination
we
would
be
free
to
look,
on
your
view,
at
whatever
had
been
presented
in
the
court
of
appeals
simply
as
a
convenient
place
where
evidence
was
reposing.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
might
take
the
position
that
the
gatekeeper
determination
having
been
made,
the
district
court
could
have
no
jurisdiction,
so
we
couldn't
send
it
to
the
district
court,
and
if
we
needed
evidence
taken
in
a
really
extraordinary
case,
i
suppose
we
could
use
a
master,
isn't
that
true?
