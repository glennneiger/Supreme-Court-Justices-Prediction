mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
106
of
title
i
of
the
1996
act
does
not
unconstitutionally
restrict
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
at
least
where
congress
does
not
divest
this
court
of
jurisdiction
to
entertain
original
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
both
mccardle
and
yerger
establish
that
no
constitutional
problem
is
presented.
unlike
the
state
of
georgia,
we
believe
that
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
original
habeas
and
section
106
are
capable
of
coexistence.
the
text
of
section
106
in
terms
does
not
address
itself
to
this
court's
original...
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
original
habeas
under
2241,
and
there's
no
reason
why
this
court
should
read
the
statute
with
that
intent
in
mind.
therefore,
we
do
not
view
the
continuation
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
original
habeas
as
in
some
way
representing
an
invasion
or
a
circumvention.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
not
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
monaghan
referred
to
our
brief
at
page
23.
i
think
our
footnote,
footnote
9,
makes
very
clear
that
we're
talking
about
the
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
decision
that
committed
the
person
to
jail.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
whatever
decision
is
holding
the
person
in
detention.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
law
is
somewhat
complicated
in
this
regard,
because
if
one
looks
at
mccardle
and
yerger,
those
were
federal
cases.
they
were
detained
ultimately
by
federal
circuit
courts.
they
were
in
military
custody,
and
then
the
circuit
courts
made
a
determination
with
respect
to
that
custody,
so
the
whole
question
of
the
supreme
court's
having
appellate
jurisdiction
over
a
federal
court
was
very
clear.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.

iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
oh,
i...
as
i
was
indicating
to
the
chief
justice,
it's
complicated
by
the
fact
that
by
mccardle
and
yerger
were
cases
having
to
do
with
the
federal
court
system,
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
state
detention,
which
is
presented
by
this
particular
case.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
court
would
not,
on
original
habeas,
be
reviewing
a
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
would
be
with
respect
to
why,
in
this
case
felker,
is
still
being
detained
by
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
after
all,
the
warden
is
here
as
the
respondent.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
right.
the
person
is
saying,
i'm
being
detained--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--in
violation
of
the
constitutional
laws
or
treaties
of
the
united
states.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i'm
not
very
clear
about
that.
certainly
the
statute
has
not
been
changed.
it's
not
clear
exactly
what
that
transfer
would
mean.
this
court
in
dealing
with
original
petitions
in
recent
times
has
not
used
that
transfer
power.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it's
simply
dismissed
these
cases
and
sent
them
to
whatever
court
is
competent
to
resolve
those
issues.
but
i
think
that
in
order
not
to
evade
the
statutory
scheme
that
congress
set
up
and
in
most
circumstances
the
transfer
to
the
district
court
would
be
for
purposes
of
the
district
court's
exercising
whatever
jurisdiction
it
had
available,
and
under
this
statutory
scheme
that
would
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
to
authorize
the
applicant
to
go
forward
in
the
district
court
before
the
district
court
could
go
forward.
this
is
not
something
that
we
would
obviously
agree,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that
makes
some
sense
in
terms
of
reconciling
2241(b)
and
section
106,
the
gatekeeper
provisions.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
that
is
also
possible.
one
of
the
things
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
i
think
is
contrary
to
the
state
of
georgia.
georgia's
position
with
respect
to
this
circumvention
and
evasion
is
that
congress
apparently
did
not
see
the
continuation
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
original
habeas
as
being
a
circumvention.
if
one
looks
at
section
103
of
the
act,
that
was
a
decision
by
congress
to
amend
rule
22
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
at
point
4
and
5a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
congress
did
there
is
amend
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
circuit
judges
to
grant
original
habeas,
and
basically
said
that
that
was
no
longer
possible.
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
knows
how
to
address
original
habeas
jurisdiction
when
it
wants
to,
and
it
concluded
that
it
did
not
wish
to
do
so
insofar
as
the
supreme
court
was
concerned.
and
to
us,
this
makes
great
sense,
because
after
all
congress
was
legislating
against
a
backdrop
of
this
court's
decisions
and
its
policies,
and
there
are
two
things
to
note
about
those
particular
decisions
and
policies.
one
is
that
for
over
70
years
this
court
has
attempted
to
impose
reasonable
restrictions
over
the
abuse
of
the
writ,
particularly
second
or
successive
petitions,
and
secondly,
in
dealing
with
original
habeas
petitions
this
court
has,
as
several
of
you
on
the
bench,
mr.
chief
justice
and
others,
have
pointed
out,
this
court
has
imposed
very
stringent
requirements
before
granting
original
habeas.
there
hasn't
been
one
granted
since
ex
parte
grossman
in
1925.
not
only
that,
the
statute
2241(b)
that
mr.
justice
stevens
just
mentioned,
2242,
which
requires
that
there
be
some
showing
of
why
the
applicant
hadn't
gone
to
another
court,
and
2254(b),
the
old
2254(b),
essentially
indicated
that
no
petition
would
be
granted
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
relief
was
not
available
any
place
else.
so--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i
think
it
is.
that
is,
the
applicant
can
go
to
the
court,
having
met
those
requirements,
if
that
applicant
has
gone
through
the
gatekeeper
process,
but
that
does
not
dictate
that
the
court
should
actually
entertain
and
grant
an
original
writ
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
certainly
it's
been
exhausted,
but
i
think
that
what
the
court
would
do
is
say
that
the
fact
that
the
person
has
been
denied,
the
applicant
has
been
denied
through
the
gatekeeper
process,
does
not
represent
an
exceptional
circumstance
that
would
warrant
this
court's
consideration
of
that
application.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
kennedy,
i
think
mandamus
probably
is
used
the
way
it's
been
used,
to
deal
with
ministerial
acts,
the
failure
of
lower
courts
to
perform
ministerial
acts.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
available,
but
certainly
the
original
petition
would
be
available
to
deal
with
miscarriages
of
justice,
or
what
might
be
viewed
by
this
court
as
a
malfunction
of
the
gatekeeper
process.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
that
since
the
statutory
original
certiorari
jurisdiction
was
available,
there
would
be
no
need
for
this
court
to
use
that
particular
common
law
writ.
