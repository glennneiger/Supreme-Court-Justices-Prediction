justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
got
into
this
when
you
indicated
that
under...
i
think
this
was
your...
the
purport
of
your
remarks,
that
under
2241
we
will
be
construing
what
(b)(2)
means.
does
that
not
assume
that
(b)(2)
provides
a
baseline
for
what
is
an
extraordinary
writ?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
would
the
mandamus
petition
be
in
order
to
protect
our
jurisdiction,
because
i
thought
we
had
no
jurisdiction.
you
seek
mandamus...
we
grant
mandamus
under
the
all
writs
act
to
protect
our...
in
aid
of
our
jurisdiction,
but
that's
circular.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
your
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
how
does
mandamus
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
would
be
the
same
as
if
the
district
court
under
prior
practice
had
been
asked
to
issue
a
writ
against
the
warden.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
case
of
an
extraordinary
error
by
a
circuit
court,
would
we
have
mandamus
jurisdiction?
