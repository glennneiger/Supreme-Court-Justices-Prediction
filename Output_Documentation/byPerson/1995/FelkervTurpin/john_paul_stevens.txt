justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
monaghan,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
your
view
on?
if
our
jurisdiction
to
entertain
an
original
habeas
writ
under
2241
is
an
exercise
of
our
appellate
jurisdiction,
rather
than
original
jurisdiction,
what
is
the
thing
that
is
being
appealed
from?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
we
have
appellate
jurisdiction
over
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
new
claim.
that
doesn't
answer
the
case
where
he
says
he's
got
a
new
claim.
your
argument
doesn't
address
that
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
alleges
a
new
claim,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
doesn't
he
just
say,
i
presented
it
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
denied
it,
there's
no
other
avenue
available?
why
doesn't
that
satisfy
the
text
of
the
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
also,
you
referred
earlier
to
mandamus.
is
it
your
view
that
there
is
mandamus
review
available,
notwith...
apart
from
the
common
law
writ
of
certiorari,
and
petition
for...
common
law
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
i
mean.
is
there
mandamus
review
available
to
either
party,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
we've
got
an
exceptional
case.
in
your
view,
is
mandamus...
and
let
me
supplement
the
question
by
saying
with
regard
to
house
v.
mayo,
which
was
cited
to
us
today,
that
was
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
review
pursuant
to
the
all
writs
act.
do
you
think
either
common
law
certiorari
or
common
law
mandamus
is
available
pursuant
to
the
all
writs
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
ask
if
it's
your
view
that,
assuming...
we're
all
very
doubtful
of
some
of
these
things...
that
there
is
such
an
original,
quote,
appellate
habeas
in
this
court,
would
2241(b)
nevertheless
apply
and
authorize
this
court
to
transfer
for
a
hearing
the
case
to
a
district
court,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
on
the
books.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
following
up
on
justice
kennedy's
thought,
what
about
the
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
that
was
used
in
house
v.
mayo?
