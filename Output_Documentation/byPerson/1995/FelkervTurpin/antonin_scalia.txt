before
you
go
on
to
the
second
point,
that
first
point
is
the
only
way
in
which
we
could
get
into
that
interpretation
of
what
106
really
means?

what
would
the
role
of
miscarriage
of
justice
have
been
in
the
days
when
we
had
no
criminal
federal
jurisdiction
at
all?

i
don't
understand
why
the...
the
question
arises,
is
it
exhaustive.
it's
utterly
useless
if
it's
not
exhaustive,
isn't
it?
justice

but
why
aren't
those
two
readily
met
by
simply
saying,
i
can't
go
some
place
else
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
i
couldn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
fact
that
relief
is
available
elsewhere
is
no
longer
an
obstacle
to
that
relief,
you
say.
