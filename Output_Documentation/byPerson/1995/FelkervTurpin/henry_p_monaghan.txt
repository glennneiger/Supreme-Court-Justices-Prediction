mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
april
24
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
became
legally
operative.
this
act
made
several
modifications
in
the
habeas
corpus
practice
of
the
federal
courts.
the
provisions
of
pertinence
here
are
contained
in
section
106(b),
which
governs
second
and
successive
petitions.
these
provisions
are
set
out
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
section
106(b)
has
three
subdivisions.
the
first
two,
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2),
provide
substantive
standards.
(b)(1)
applies
to
claims
previously
adjudicated.
(b)(2)
applies
to
new
claims
both
of
law
and
of
fact.
the
last
section,
(b)(3),
governs
the
procedures
on
second
and
successive
petitions,
and
it
clearly
alters
the
prior
practice.
essentially
it
requires
that,
before
the
district
court
can
entertain
a
petition,
a
second
petition,
the
petitioner
must
obtain
an
authorization
order
from
an
appropriate
panel
of
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals.
subsection
(c),
to
which
we
will
have
more
reference,
provides...
and
that
is
set
out
on
page
3...
the
court
of
appeals
may
authorize
the
filing
of
a
second
or
successive
application
only
if
it
determines
that
the
application
makes
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
applicant
satisfies
the
relevant
substantive
criteria.
subsection...
finally,
we
turn
to
section
103(e),
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
3,
and
that
provides
the
grant
or
denial
of
any
authorization
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
file
a
second
or
successive
application
shall
not
be
appealable
and
shall
not
be
the
subject
of
a
petition
for
rehearing
or
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
on
may
1,
a
petition
was
filed
in
this
court
styled
a
writ
of
habeas...
on
may
2,
a
petition
was
filed
in
this
court
styled
as
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
appellate
or
certiorari
review,
and
among
other
things
the
petition
invoked
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
2241(a),
the
so-called
original
habeas
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
which
from
time
out
of
mind
has
existed
as
an
appellate
remedy.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
from
time
out
of
mind
has
existed
as
an
appellate
remedy,
your
honor.
it
couldn't
exist
as
an
original
writ
because
of
marbury
v.
madison.
it
would
be
an
attempt
to
expand
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court.
on
may
3,
this
court
granted
a
stay
of
execution,
granted
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
ordered
briefing
limited
to
three
questions.
i
will,
of
course,
address
the
questions
that
the
court
posed.
to
the
extent
that
time
permits
and
the
court
feels
it
helpful,
i
would
be
prepared
to
offer
our
preliminary
views
as
to
the
standards
that
should
be
applied
if
the
court
concludes,
as
we
hope
it
will
and
believe
that
it
should,
that
section
106
of
the
new
legislation
does
not
impair
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
2241(a).
the
three
questions
framed
by
this
court
ask
whether,
when
mr.
felker's
attorneys
presented
their
petition
to
the
clerk
of
the
court,
he
was
obliged,
by
virtue
of
the
new
legislation,
particularly
section
106(3)(e),
to
reject
it
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
and
second,
if
he
was,
whether
section
106
is
unconstitutional.
until
we
receive
georgia's
reply
brief,
we
believed
that
both
parties
and
the
solicitor
general,
who
represents
the
views
of
the
united
states,
agreed
upon
the
appropriate
response.
while
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
must
be
dismissed,
section
106(3)(e)
did
not
restrict
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
2241(a).
with
the
sole
exception
of
senator
hatch,
the
amici
took
the
same
position.
perhaps
i
am
mistaken,
but
in
its
reply
brief,
georgia
now
seems
to
have
moved
from
a
position
that
sparing
review
under
section
2241(a)
is
permitted,
and
to
a
position
in
which
it
now
seems
to
argue
no
review
at
all
is
possible
under
2241(a),
that
this
was
the
congressional
intention.
to
the
extent
that
georgia
does
so
in
its
reply
brief,
it
does
so
without
addressing
any
of
the
arguments
that
we
advanced
in
our
initial
brief
based
upon
plain
meaning,
nor
does
it
discuss
the
relevance
of
this
court's
citations
going
back
at
least
to
martin
v.
hunter's
lessee
and
cohens
v.
virginia,
which
postulate
the
need
for
uniformity
in
the
administration
of
federal
law,
and
in
cohens
a
reluctance
to
interpret
congressional
statutes
to
foreclose
appellate
jurisdiction.
nor
does
it
even
refer
to
mccardle
and
yerger,
despite
our
heavy
reliance
upon
those
cases
for
the
proposition
that
the
rule
laid
down
in
cohens
v.
virginia,
which
is
that
you
do
not
construe
congressional
legislation
to
impair
your
jurisdiction
unless
it's
clear
it
has
a
special
stringent
effect
when
claims
involving
constitutional
right
involving
the
deprivation
of
liberty
are
at
stake.
the
georgia
reply
brief
does
make
one
substantive
argument.
it
asserts
that
it
would
be
unfair
if
habeas
were
available,
since
the
warden
would
have
no
opportunity
to
get
review
of
a
decision.
on
its
face,
this
is
a
very
curious
argument,
because
habeas
corpus
has
always
been
asymmetrical
in
that
respect.
no
one
has
ever
thought
it
was
unfair
to
the
state
that
the
writ
might
be
available
to
the
prisoner
on
appropriate
circumstances.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
that...
i
think
first
of
all,
two
things.
i
think
that
asymmetry
is
built
into
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus.
the
prisoner
always
can
sue
for
the
writ,
but
the
warden
can't
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
against
the
prisoner.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
your
honor.
well,
the...
let
me
put
it...
maybe
a
different
response.
the
warden
will
always
get
review.
what
they're
trying
to
introduce
is
a
new
asymmetry
into
the
statute.
if
the
writ
is
granted
by
the
court,
it
will
go
down
to
the
district
court.
however
it
rules,
the
case
will
come
back
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
go
on
cert
to
this
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
engage
in
a
gatekeeping
function
here,
but
one
of
the
points
we
want
to
make
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
merits
of
this
case,
and
that's
a
point
which
i'm
going
to
address,
which
is
the...
and
it
decided
it
in
an
egregious
manner,
if
you
actually
study
what
it
did.
but
it
did
not
perform
a
gatekeeping
function
here,
but
that's
a...
that
goes
to
a
somewhat
different
point.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's...
yes,
your
honor,
and
if
there
is
an
asymmetry,
if
there
were,
it
would
hardly
strike
me
as
a
point
of
great
substance,
given
the
tradition
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now,
senator
hatch's
brief
devotes
a
scant
two
pages,
pages
that
are
tacked
on
at
the
very
end
of
his
brief,
to
the
argument
that
section
106
bars
original
habeas.
like
georgia's
reply
brief,
he
addresses
none
of
the
arguments
we
make
or
the
authorities
we
invoke.
senator
hatch's
brief
is,
however,
very
interesting
for
what
it
does
not
state.
despite
the
brief's
copious
references
to
the
number
and
comprehensive
character
of
the
senate
and
house
debates,
senator
hatch
cites
not
a
single
sentence
of
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
congress
gave
the
slightest
thought
to
this
court's
original
jurisdiction.
senator
hatch's
brief
constitutes
a
form
of
postenactment
legislative
history.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
if
the
argument
is
that
it
was
inadvertently
omitted,
i
might
say
that
this
court
is
not
authorized
to
write
legislation
that
congress
might
have
written
but
didn't
write.
if
it
was
inadvertently
omitted,
then
congress
will
presumably
get
a
chance
to
do
it,
but
it's
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
rewrite
the
statute,
and
i
think
adherence
to
that
principle
is
especially
important,
because
it
would
curtail
the
historic
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
a
curtailment
that,
as
we
have
suggested,
would
raise
some
constitutional
problems.
finally,
we
have
no
idea
whether
congress
would
or
would
not
have
enacted
legislation
that
in
terms
directly
sought
to
impair
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
so--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--on
behalf
of
the
warden,
or
on
behalf
of--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--that's
a
hard
question,
your
honor,
because
it
doesn't
impair
jurisdiction
under
the
all
writs
act,
either,
and
there
is
at
least
one
case,
house
v.
mayo,
in
which
effectively
habeas
corpus
relief
was
given
under
section
1651,
but
there
is
a
body
of
case
law
in
your
court,
last
invoked
in
an
opinion
by
justice
scalia
last
year,
or
early
this
year,
which
says
that
section
106
is
inoperative
if
there's
a
specific
provision
that
deals
with
the
proposed
remedy,
and
so
that
brings
you
back
to
2241(a),
and
for
that
reason
i
was
unwilling
to
brief
that
point.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
well,
the
various
briefs,
if
you
look
at
them
carefully,
sharply
divide
on
what
happens
if
you
have
authority
to
entertain
the
writ
and,
given
the
limited
time
constraints
and
the
lack
of
developments
in
the
brief,
we
can
only
give
you
our
initial
thoughts
about
this.
i
will
point
out
that
there's
a
wide
difference
between
the
united
states
and
us
on
the
very
issue
that
you
ask.
most
of
the
briefs
seem
to
assume,
amici
briefs
seem
to
assume
that
you
must
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
first.
one
of
the
briefs
suggested
if
you
go...
that's
a
precondition
to
coming
here.
one
of
the
briefs
suggest
that
if
you
come
to
the
court
of
appeals
first,
you
can
never
come
here.
it
leaves
unclear
what
that
amici
thinks
is
being
reviewed.
it's
also
quite
unclear
from
the
united
states'
brief
what
is
being
reviewed
on
the
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
and
that's
our
position.
our
position
is
that
you
must
go
to
the
panel
first,
and
then
you
seek
review
here,
and
the
question
then
becomes,
what
does
this
court
do
once
it
gets
the
case,
and
on
that
point,
we
take
as
a
baseline
what
was
said
in
the
schlup
case.
successive
petitions
should
rarely
be
granted
by
any
federal
court,
and
certainly
they
should
be
rarely
entertained
on
the
merits
in
this
court.
that's
the
baseline
against
which
we
start.
but
given
this
court's
role
in
the
constitutional
system,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
original
jurisdiction
could
be
invoked
to
decide
routine
factual
questions
or
resolve
routine
questions
of
the
application
of
law
to
fact.
but
having
said
all
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
essentially
two
kinds
of
questions
that
are
going
to
arise.
the
first
set
concerns
the
meaning
of
section
106.
what
does
it
mean?
we
think
that's
open
on
an
original
writ,
and
we
think
that
this
petition
raises
important
questions
about
what
106
really
does
mean.
the
second
set,
and
here's
where
the
solicitor
general
and
us
seem
to
depart,
concerns
the
role
of
this
court
apart
from
simply
interpreting
section
2241.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no.
it's
possible
that
you
would
get...
it
was
possible
you
would
get
some
of
these
questions
in
the
grant
context.
now,
but
as
justice
souter
points
out,
in
the
grant
context
you're
using...
if
the
writ
is
rejected
or
sustained
in
the
lower
federal
courts
you're
really
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
you're
not
likely
to
see
as
many
questions
under
section
106
if
you
rely
solely...
if
denial
cases
are
excluded
from
your
jurisdiction.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes.
we--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--yes,
and
that
is
a...
that's
a
question
which
we
may
have
flubbed.
we
understood
that
largely,
i
think,
your
honor,
in
terms
of...
although
we're
prepared
to
discuss
it,
we
understood
it
largely
in
terms
of
the
problem
of
foreclosure
of
review
in
this
court,
and
not
with
respect
to
briefing
on
the
question
of
standards.
given
the
time
constraints,
and
given
the
way
the
questions
were
framed--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--well,
the
only
provisions
that
could
apply
to
this
court--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--yes,
the
only
provisions
that
could
apply
are
the
substantive
standards
of
106(b),
and--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--(b)(2).
those
standards
are
the
only
ones
we're
really
talking
about.
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
in
this
case.
we
can...
and
in
large
part,
and
i
do
think
that
that's
a
point
that
needs
thought,
and
it
also
needs
thought
from
our
point
of
view,
given
the
fact
that
we
have
a
client
to
represent.
i
do
think
a
great
deal
depends
on
what
section
106(b)(2)
means.
there
are
severe
construction
problems,
here.
to
name
one,
what
is
the
role...
what
106(b)(2)
is,
if
you
take
a
look
at
it,
this
is
really
a
congressional
attempt
to
define
cause
and
prejudice.
(b)(2)
applies
to
new
facts
and
new
law.
it
has
a
prejudice
component
built
into
it,
and
it
also
has
a
cause
proponent
built
into
it,
but
it
doesn't
exhaust
the
universe
of
claims,
and
it
doesn't
exhaust
the
problems
that
this
court
would
have
to
address.
specifically,
what
is
the
role
of
miscarriage
of
justice
claims
under
the
newly
reformulated
congressional
standards?
in
this
case,
the
essential
claims
being
made
on
the
petition
are
three
in
nature.
they
are
all
directed
to
a
single
inquiry,
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
you
had
it
under
the
all
writs
act.
you
exercised
it
routinely
in
the
19th
century.
there
never
has
been
a
point
in
time
in
which...
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
in
which
you
couldn't
review
a
criminal
conviction
of
either
a
state
or
federal
court
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
violation
of
a
federal
right.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
they
were
not
reviewed,
and
the
difference
was
in
the
19th
century
what
the...
if
you
look...
there's
a
nice
discussion
by
dallin
oaks
in
his
article.
it
was
quite
comprehensive.
but
you
look
at
what
happened
in
the
19th
century,
starting
with
ex
parte
bollman,
going
back
before
ex
parte
bollman,
going
back
to
1795,
this
court
used
the
appellate
writ
to
hit
at
fundamental
errors--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--not
routinely.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
we...
the
first...
the
challenges
to
the
final
judgments
conviction
really
don't
emerge
until
1873.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
siebold,
ex
parte
lang,
but
they
come,
incidentally,
your
honor,
from
a
court
that
also
said
that
the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
a
privilege
of
immunity
of
national
citizenship.
that's
said
in
the
slaughterhouse
cases,
83
u.s.
at
page
82,
and
so
one
of
the
questions
that
would
have
to
be
faced
is,
if
this...
is
what
that
phrase
means
in
the
20th
century,
in
1996.
it
is
interesting
also,
your
honor,
that
while
the
government...
the
united
states,
i
mean...
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
defending
the
position
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
could
not
reach
anything
in
1789
other
than
executive
detention,
it
distanced
itself
from
embracing
that
view
in
the
footnote,
a
very
lengthy
footnote.
the
government
is
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
will
defend
that
position
today,
because...
and
rightly
so.
it
can't
ignore
200
years
of
history.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
government
argues
that
it
does.
the
government
argues
that
it
does,
and
the
government
makes
an
argument
that
we
would
have
to
address
if
we
disagreed
with
it.
it
would
provide
a
baseline,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
exhaustive?
take
the...
and
there
are
two
kinds
of
cases
which
the
statute
doesn't
remotely
address.
one
is
the
role
of
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
no.
it
depends
on
what
it
means.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
let
me
give
you
an...
oh,
sorry.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that
may
be,
your
honor,
and
if
that's
the
construction
which
you
put
on
it,
then
it
raises
substantial
questions
whether
or
not...
not
necessarily
in
the
federal
court,
but
in
the
state
court
broader
postconviction
relief
must
be
available.
the...
let
me
put
a
case.
if
our
case
falls
outside
the
statute,
we
have
a
claim
of
miscarriage
of
justice.
we
have
a
claim
in
this
case
despite
what
judge
carne
said
in
the
lower
court
in
which
a
cage
instruction
was
given
14
times.
twelve
times
they
were
personalized.
each
juror
got
his
own
personal
cage
instruction.
now,
if
that
claim...
and
we
also
now
have
substantial
other
evidence
of
innocence.
if
that
claim
falls
outside
of
section
2244(b)
as
it
now
stands,
then
a
state
court
must
entertain
it.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
the
due
process
clause
would
require
postconviction
relief
in
those
circumstances
in
our
view,
so
long
as
palko
v.
connecticut
and
rochin
v.
california
are
the
law
of
the
land.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
standard
is
not
fact-specific.
conduct
which
shocks
the
conscience,
or
in
your
opinion
in
the
brecht
case,
your
honor,
you
were
very
much
concerned
in
analyzing
harmless
error
cases
to
discuss
questions
of
fundamental
fairness.
i
would
stand
basically
on
justice
o'connor's
footnote.
justice
o'connor's...
the
quote
from
justice
o'connor
at
the
bottom
of
25,
the
historic
function
of
habeas
corpus
is
to
prevent
the
execution
of
an
innocent
person,
and
if
the
claim
is
strong
enough
and
there
is
other
constitutional
error,
some
court
must
consider
it.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
we
certainly--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--yes,
we
could
certainly--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--and
what
we
would
do
is
to
argue
that
the
statute
does
mean
that,
and
if
it
doesn't--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--well,
i
don't
know
how
to
respond
to
that.
yes,
i
think
it
really...
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
statute--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--you
should
try
to
get
there,
absolutely.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
because
you
don't
want
to
have
a...
because
the
historic--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--i
don't
think
it's
a
torture,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
i
don't
think
it's
a
torture,
and
to
say
you're
going
to
apply
the
statute
as
written
presupposes
that
this
statute
is
quite
plain.
but
suppose
that
it
were
quite
plain,
then
you'd
have
another
question,
are
the
criteria
exhausted,
and
it
doesn't
follow,
justice
scalia,
that
the
statute
would
be
meaningless.
it
would
open
a
wedge
for
cases
in
which
the
fundamental
claim
was
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
uh-huh.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
yes,
i--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--no,
there
would
be
another
question
you
would
have
to
face,
and
let
me
say,
your
honor,
the
panel
says
that
the
instruction
is
given
twice,
and
then
it
applies
harmless
error
analysis.
this
is
what
the
judge
does,
and
says,
it's
given
twice
and
it's
really
sort
of
harmless,
it
was
offset.
the
most
important
document
that
we've
filed
in
this
court
is
the
original
writ,
and
on
page
18
in
a
footnote
you
will
see
that
the
prosecutor
gave
each
juror
his
own
personal
cage
instruction.
when
that
was
called
to
the
attention
of
judge
carnes,
his
response
was,
oh,
well,
right
after
that
he
instructed
the
jury
that
it
was
not
to
consider
counsel's
argument
as
evidence.
this
occurred
not
when
counsel
was
opening,
this
occurred
at
the
voir
dire.
the
second
thing
judge...
the
judge
says
is
that
we
defaulted
our
claim
in
any
event.
that's
what
he...
he...
we
had
to
exhaust
our
claim
in
the
state
court.
if
we
were
right
as
to
when
our
cage
claim
arose,
our
cage
claim
was
not
exhausted
in
the
state
court
till
about
may
1.
so
before
you
jump
and
conclude
that
you
could
decide
the
case
in
accordance
with
the
panel's
opinion,
we
would
like
to
be
heard
on
that.
but
if...
but
it
raises
another
question
under
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeal...
and
that's
the
construction
of
3(c).
the
court
of
appeals
may
authorize
the
filing
of
a
second
or
successive
application
only
if
it
determines
that
the
application
makes
a
prima
facie
case.
judge
carnes,
in
one
day,
turned
around
a
24-page
opinion
on
the
merits.
now,
he
did
not
play
the
role
of
the
gatekeeper
in
this
case,
and
that's
all
he
was
supposed
to
do.
that's
all
the
panel
was
supposed
to
do.
this
statute
passed
by
congress
with
respect
to
second
petitions
is
not
the
work
of
attila
the
hun.
i
mean,
this
is
an
attempt,
as
runs
throughout
the
entire
statutory
scheme,
to
make
sense
out
of
habeas.
the
testimony
in
the
house...
i
mean,
in
the
senate
over
and
over,
mainly
by
senator
hatch
was,
i
want
to
do
two
things.
we
believe
in
habeas
corpus,
and
we
want
to
prevent
abuses
of
the
writ.
second
petition
cases
do
raise
a
problem
about
abuse
of
the
writ,
but--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--i'm
glad
that
you
asked
that,
your
honor,
because
i
have
opened
the
government's
brief,
and
you...
the...
what
is
being
appealed
from
in
this
case
is
the
denial
of
the
certificate
to
go
forward
to
the
district--
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
from
the
government's
brief.
that's
what...
and...
because
the
traditional
jurisdiction
in
habeas
corpus
originally
was
always
to
revise
a
judgment
of
a
lower
court.
the...
ex
parte
yerger
is
a
wonderful
example.
now,
the
government's
position,
i
don't
know
what
the
government
thinks
you're
reviewing
in
this
case.
the
government's
position
at
the
bottom
of
page
23
first
argues
that
section
106
applies
to
this
court,
and
then
it
says,
it
is
true
that
the
courts
will
have
no
opportunity
to
announce
except
in
dicta
the
requirements
for
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
application
satisfies
the
requirements
of
section
106(b)(3)(c),
because
the
court
of
appeals'
determination
that
the
habeas
petitioner
has
or
has
not
made
out
a
prima
facie
showing
is
not
subject
to
review
on
certiorari.
it's
a
non
sequitur.
under
our
view,
it's
reviewable
on
the
original
writ.
but
what
is
apparent
if
you
look
at
the
government's
brief,
it
is
not
clear
what
the
government
thinks
you're
reviewing.
you
must
be
reviewing
some
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that
would
be
completely
contrary
to
the
whole
practice
in
the
19th
century.
every
case
we
cite...
yerger,
marbury
v.
madison...
must
be
revising
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
the
19th
century...
dallin
oaks'
article
sets
this
out
quite
clearly,
and
we
have
many
cases
which
we
could
provide.
mr.
henry
p.
monaghan
that's
right...
no,
you're
not...
that
is
not
the
practice.
you're
reviewing
not
the
judgment
of
the
detaining
court,
you're
reviewing
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
refuses
authorization.
in
ex
parte
young,
the
circuit
court
had
refused
to
grant
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
a
person
was
being
held
by
a
military
court.
the
supreme
court
made
it
very
clear
that
you
were
reviewing
the
denial
of
relief.
i
might
save
a
minute
or
two,
if
i...
thank
you.
