it
suggests,
though,
does
it
not,
that
it
was...
mr.
monaghan,
that
it
was
omitted
inadvertently,
because
what
does
come
across
from
that
brief
was
the
intention
to
foreclose
any
review
if
the
appellate
panel
refused
to
certify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
2241(a)
work
on
your
interpretation?
does
this
court
have
authority
only
after
the
court
of
appeals
has
failed
to
certify?
can
a
petitioner
apply
to
both
places
simultaneously,
or
is
there
some
sequence,
or
can
the
appellate
panel
be
bypassed
altogether
and
come
directly
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
monaghan,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
the
panel
when
it
said,
old
law,
no
law...
new
law,
we
would
come
out
the
same
way
on
this
petition,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--position,
then
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
us
to
determine
whether
our
current
rule
20.4(a),
sets
the
standard--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
just
says
rarely
granted,
or
this
new
statute.
it
would
be
kind
of
an
academic
question
for
us
to
engage
in.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
ms.
boleyn,
part
of
the
yerger
decision
was
to
clarify
that
although
it's
an
original
writ,
the
jurisdiction
that
this
court
exercises
is
appellate,
because
apart
from
the
original
jurisdiction
that
article
iii
gives
to
this
court,
there
can
be
no
other
authority
other
than
appellate
in
this
court.
so
under
yerger,
the
basic
writ
was
preserved,
and
it
was
described
and
explained
as
an
exercise
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
an
original
writ,
but
appellate
jurisdiction.
so
why
isn't
this
precisely
the
same?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
i
don't
understand
your
position
that
2241
exists.
you
say
it
exists
on
paper.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
it
is
effectively
repealed.
which
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
now
your
position
is,
it
was
repealed
by
implication.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
a
dead
letter,
so
it's
not...
it
doesn't
exist.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
it
is
preserved,
if
2241
continues,
not
just
on
paper--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
more
would
you
propose
than
what
our
rule
already
says,
which
is
exceptional
circumstances
rarely
granted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well
then,
why
not
call
it
what
is
the
most
accurate
fit
for
what's
sought
here?
what's
sought
here
is
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
and
you're
saying,
just
recharacterize
it
as
a
writ
of
mandamus.
i
don't
follow
that
argument.
i
can
understand
the
argument
that
2241
is
out
of
the
picture,
there
is
nothing
once
you're
finished
with
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
don't
understand
this
label
that
maybe
mandamus
but
not
habeas.
