ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
various
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
federal
habeas
corpus
for
state
prisoners,
concern
has
been
expressed
on
the
previous
statutory
parameters
governing
the
well
recognized
problem
of
successive
habeas
corpus
litigants.
now,
congress
has
acted,
we
submit,
within
its
authority
to
regulate
the
consideration
of
successive
petitions
while
we
contend
not
impermissibly
interfering
with
this
court's
jurisdiction
or
having
the
effect
of
suspending
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
while
it
might
appear
at
first,
from
a
review
of
the
briefs,
that
the
parties
are
not
very
far
apart
on
their
views
as
to
the
statute,
there's
one
thing
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
wishes
to
make
adamantly
clear,
and
that
is
that
we
are
very
far
apart
on
the
essential
issue
underlying
the
resolution
by
this
court
of
the
three
issues
that
it
has
posed.
first,
the
respondent
opposes
any
interpretation
of
the
act
and
its
impact
on
2241
which
would
engender
further
delay,
whereas
the
petitioner--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
with
specific
reference
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
our
position
is
that,
while
the
original
writ
exists
on
paper,
because
the
new
act
does
not
mention
2241,
that
there
was
no
intent
of
congress
to
allow
the
applicability
of
2241
to
successive
habeas
corpus
petitions,
so
it
does
not
exist
for
that
purpose.
alternatively,
we
say--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
again
i
believe
what
earlier
has
been
said
by
other
justices,
that
there...
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
permissible
restriction.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
well,
i
think
that
this
court
has
recognized
exceptions
to
its
jurisdiction
both
in
the
constitutional
venue
under
article
iii--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
exactly
you're
asking
me
to
respond
to.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
original
jurisdiction
is
affected,
if
that's
what
you're
saying.
it's
original
in
the
sense,
as
justice
souter
said,
that
it's
directly
filed
with
the
court,
but
it
doesn't
interfere
with
the
court's
original
jurisdiction
because
essentially,
as
has
been
said
earlier,
we're
asking
the
court
to
look
at
it
as
an
appellate...
part
of
its
appellate
jurisdiction,
so
in
response
to
that
question,
it's
not
interfering
with
the
original
jurisdiction,
it's
just
interfering
with...
permissibly,
we
think,
with
the
direct
attempt
to
file
a
habeas
corpus
petition
with
this
court.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
you
do
not--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--you
have
the
right
under
your...
under
writ...
under
2241
to
look
at
extraordinary
cases
for
extraordinary
relief.
our
view
is
that
in
the
context
of
successive
petitions--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--you
have
the
right...
that
right
still
exists.
we're
asking
that
the
court
use
the
backdrop
of
its
rules
and
its
jurisprudence
to
find
it
has
no
applicability
in
the
context
of
successive
habeas
corpus
petitions,
and
the
reason
that
we're
saying
that
is
because,
if
this
court
has
the
right
to
guarantee
a
direct
access
of
the
petitioner
to
this
court,
then
essentially
this
court
becomes
a
lower
court
who
is
doing
nothing
but
relitigating
what
congress
has
delegated
to
the
lower
court
as
being
their
task.
it
makes
this
court
a
factfinder.
it
makes
this
court
determine
such
issues
as
cause
and
prejudice--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--because,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
what's
being
done
in
this
case
is
attempting
to
substitute,
and
under
petitioner's
view
this
court
would
be
substituted
for
the
lower
court.
it's...
they're
saying
that
it's
exercising
appellate
jurisdiction,
but
what
the
lower
court...
you
would
be
actually
acting
as
a
factfinder
determining
the
prima
facie
case,
because
our
position
is
that
this
court
would
be
bound
by
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act,
so
in
that
sense
this
court
would
become
a
factfinder.
that
is
not
within
its
jurisdiction
on
the
appellate
level.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
the
appellate
court
jurisdiction
doesn't
encompass
factfinders.
i'm
sorry,
justice
souter.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
that's
a
possible
reading.
our
interpretation
is
that
you
would
be
bound
by
the
necessity
of
having
the
petitioner
make
a
prima
facie
case
showing
to--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes.
by
the
terms
of
the
act,
yes.
it's
our
position
that
insofar
as
2241
exists
for
successive
state
habeas,
that
the
court
should
find
itself
to
be
bound
by
those
issues
just
the
same
way
that
the
court
found
in
its
rules
that
it
was
bound
by
exhaustion
requirements
and,
of
course,
that
the
petitioner
under
this
court's
rule
has
to
establish
why
it
hasn't
sought
the
relief
from
the
lower
court.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
yes,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what
we're
asking
the
court
not
to
do,
not
to
denigrate
the
court's
article
iii
jurisdiction
by
going
and
becoming
a
factfinder.
congress
has
tried
to
delegate
that
factfinding
screening
process,
as
the
petitioner
said,
to
the
lower
courts,
so
we're
asking
the
court
to
reserve
the
direct
writ,
as
we
choose
to
call
it,
for
those
rare
and
extraordinary
circumstances
where
there
is
not
another
avenue
of
relief.
he
had
another
avenue
of
relief.
he
was
simply
found
to
have
been
foreclosed
by
the
lower
court,
so
by
its
terms
we
do
not
think
that
where
the
other
avenues
of
relief
terminology--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--that's
our
position,
except
perhaps
in
those
cases
where,
as
mr.
felker
did,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
as
a
whole
has
been
challenged.
our
position
is
another
option
that
the
petitioner
had
was,
he
could
have
filed
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
the
eleventh
circuit
asking
that
they
interpret
the
act.
so
the
only
exceptional
relief
that
he
could
have
sought
was
not
just
simply
try
to
file
an
original
habeas
corpus
petition--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
when
i'm
saying
that
is
that
exceptional
relief
such
as
the
type
that
the
petitioner
is
seeking
in
this
case,
for
example,
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
or
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional,
is
exactly
the
type
of
situation
that
the
court
might
want
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
your
honor,
i
think--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--your
honor,
i
think
that
perhaps
i
was
not
clear
about
what
i
was
saying.
i
think
that
there
always
remains
an
avenue
of
relief
for
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
to
try
to
challenge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
but
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
his
only
avenue
perhaps
may
have
been
to
try
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
act
by
means
of
some
sort
of
extraordinary
relief.
maybe
he
would
have
chosen
the
mandamus
or
declaratory
judgment,
or
some
other
extraordinary
relief,
but
insofar
as
he's
trying
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
review
the
fact
that
the
eleventh
circuit
said
he
hadn't
made
a
prima
facie
case
and
he
wasn't
entitled
to
relief
under
the
old
act,
our
position
is
he
should
not
be
able
to
invoke
the
original
extraordinary
jurisdiction
of
the
court
for
that
purpose.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
correct.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
not
for
the
particularities
of
the
case,
but
only
if
there's
something
overriding.
now,
perhaps--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
my
answer's
no.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
myself
more
fully,
justice--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i've
been
trying
to
do...
justice,
i
think
what
we're
saying
is,
if
someone
brought
a
claim
of
innocence,
congress
has
already
spoken
and
said
that
primarily
claims
of
innocence
in
the
first
instance
under
georgia
law
ought
to
be
to
the
state
courts,
anything
from
a
motion
for
new
trial,
an
extraordinary
motion
for
a
new
trial,
or
a
petition
for
clemency.
insofar
as
innocence
is
relevant
to
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
congress
has
chosen
to
narrow
the
views
in
which
innocence
is
germane
to
a
reviewing
court's
consideration,
and
under
the
new
provisions
of
106,
they
have
informed
us
exactly
how
innocence
will
be
viewed,
and
they
have
left
out,
deliberately
it
appears
to
me--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--you
should
not
review
it.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
you
should
not
review
it
because
he
petitioner
is
seeking
to
obtain
habeas
corpus
relief
from
this
court
as
prohibited
by
the
statute,
and
the
only
thing
that
they
could
be
trying
to
do
is
get
you
to
review
the
prima
facie
decision
not
to
go
forward.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
because--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--effectively
repealed,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
there
is
no...
under
the
plain
meaning
rule
there
is
no
reference,
direct
reference
in
the
act
to
2241,
but
we
are
saying
in
our
position,
in
light
of
successive
petition
concerns,
that
it
has
effectively
been--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
and,
of
course,
alternatively,
if
the
court
finds
it
does
exist,
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
make
it
rare
and
extraordinary
in
a
situation
where,
perhaps,
jurisdiction
or
some
other
unusual
situation
might
be
envisioned.
the
only
one
i
could
think
of
that
might
possibly
do
is
if
you
could
talk
about
there
was
some
sort
of
last
minute
claim
of
conpetency
to
be
be
executed,
for
example,
which
is
a
separate
proceeding
that
wouldn't
come
up
in
the
regular
courts
of
federal
habeas
corpus--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--right.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think,
your
honor,
what
we
have
proposed
is
that
the
court
interpreted...
there's
another
portion
of
that
rule
that
talks
about
that
the
petitioner
has
to
establish
that
he
has
no
other
forum
available
to
litigate
his
claim
and
no
other
avenues
of
relief.
we're
saying
that
the
petitioner
seems
to
interpret
that
as
saying
that
he
has
nothing
left
now,
not
that
he
never
had
anything.
and
what
we're
trying
to
get
this
court
is
to
interpret
its
own
rules
as
saying
that,
having
had
cert
jurisdiction
in
this
case
three
times
already,
and
he
still
has
remaining
a
petition
for
cert
available
if
he
wishes
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
state
habeas
corpus
court
dismissing
the
second
petition,
that
that's
not
the
same
thing
as
never
having
a
forum
in
which
to
litigate
your
claim,
that
that
particular
forum
is
not
meant
for
repetitive
litigation
of
the
same
issues
that
have
already
been
adjudicated
adversely
to
a
petitioner.
so
an
original
writ,
under
our
view
and
what
we
would
hope
you
would
interpret
the
rules
further,
not
to
allow
repetitious
litigation
of
the
same
claims,
especially
in
the
face
of
a
congressional
delineation
in
the
lower
court.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
where
he
has
a
new
and
different
claim?
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
well--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
think
because
in
a
new
claim
situation,
the
court
bars
new
claims
for
lots
of
reasons.
it's
no
more
egregious
to
bar
him
from
consideration
of
a
new
claim
as
it
is
to
use
procedural
default
or
a
teague
retroactivity
bar.
that's
no
different.
there's
always
lots
of
hurdles
that
they
need
to
overcome,
and
this
is
just
an
additional
hurdle,
or
a
specific
hurdle
they
have
to
overcome,
the
successive
petition
bar
as
it
exists
in
106.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
believe
that's
true.
i
think
where
we're
together
is
that
if
it
applies,
the
second
two
provisions
apply,
but
i
believe
that
we
say
it's
effectively
been
repealed
by
implication.
so
that's
where
we
would--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
think
this
court
in
its
rules
refers
to
exceptional
relief.
how
much
more--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--probably
so.
probably
1651
still
exists
as
some
sort
of
exercise
of
this
court's
discretionary
powers.
of
course,
we
would
hope
that
that
would
be
a
very
limited
view
of
that,
but
i
think
it
would
exist.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
right.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
the
short
answer
to
your
question
is,
we
want
extraordinary
relief
to
even
be
more
extraordinary
in
the
context
of
the
success
of
the
petition.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
guess
that's
what
we're
saying
that
it...
by
your
own
definition
of
it
in
rule
20,
it's
supposed
to
be
rare,
extraordinary,
drastic
remedy.
that's--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--well,
i
think
that
what
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
do
is
make
an
extraordinary
remedy
an
ordinary
remedy.
it
isn't
that
we're
trying
to
make
it--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
think
you
have
limited
exceptional
power.
all
i
can
say
is,
our
position--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--not
under
2241.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
right,
and
perhaps
under
the
all
writs
act
as
well,
in
some
sense.
usually
of
course,
in
a
death
penalty
case,
when
you're
dealing
with
the
all
writs
act,
the
all
writs
act
is
in
virtue...
goes...
accompanies
a
motion
for
stay
of
execution
which,
of
course,
usually
is
accompanied
by
some
other
form
of
proceeding,
usually
a
successive
federal
habeas.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i
think
i
am,
or
perhaps
i'm
just
not
being
clear.
i
think
ordinary
relief--
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
--i
guess
my
position
is
that
all
extraordinary
relief
has
not
been
eliminated
by
virtue
of
the
act,
but
that
extraordinary
relief
should
remain
extraordinary.
that's
the
only
way
i
can
answer
your
question
in
a
brief
way.
ms.
susan
v.
boleyn
i'm
not
asking
the
court,
your
honor,
to
recharacterize
it
as
mandamus.
i'm
simply
saying
i
think
mandamus
still
exists
for
examining
jurisdictional
defects.
it
does
not
exist,
and
we
would
not
urge
that
it
be
applied,
to
traditional
habeas
corpus
cases.
i
mean,
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
urge
that
on
all
exceptional
relief,
and
our
position
is
not
eliminated
by
the
act.
