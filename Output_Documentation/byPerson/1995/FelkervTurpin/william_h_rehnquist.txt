chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-8836,
ellis
wayne
felker
v.
tony
turpin.
mr.
monaghan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
what,
mr.
monaghan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
it
is,
indeed,
an
appellate...
if
the
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
as
you
say,
is
appellate
in
this
case,
then
it
does
seem
that
the
prisoner
could
obtain
relief,
but
certainly
it
does
not
seem,
under
cases
like
yerger,
that
the
warden
could.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
in
an
appellate
situation,
supposing
the
district
court
grants
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
state
or
the
government
can
appeal
from
the
grant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
is
just
really
screening--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
certainly,
if
you're
correct
in
your
position
and
the
solicitor
general
that
certiorari
doesn't
lie
here,
there's
no
way
of
directly
reviewing
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
our
rule
20
says
you
have
to
have
sought
relief
everywhere
else
before
coming
here
for
an
original
writ,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
question
number
2--
--well,
do
we--
--question
number
2
in
this
case
is...
asks
us
to
construe
the
provisions
of
106.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
what
extent
do
the
provisions
of
106
apply
to
this
court
in
its
exercise
of
our
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
agree
that
the
provisions
of
106
do
apply
to
this
court
when
we
are
exercising
our
original
habeas
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
i
mean.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
was
certainly
a
lot
of
criminal
convictions
in
the
19th
century,
you
could
not
appeal
them
and
they
were
not
reviewed
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--not
challenging
final
judgments
of
conviction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
siebold,
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
maybe...
maybe--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--maybe
congress
thought
this
was
as
much
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice
as
they
wanted
the
courts
to
look
into.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
rochin
is
a
fact-specific
case
if
there
ever
was
one.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
bring
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
we
try
to
get
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
we
just
try
to
apply
the
statute
as
written?
i
mean,
rather
than
trying
to
torture
some
meaning
out
of
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
not
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
you
read
ex
parte
grossman,
you
don't
seem
to
have
had
that
in
mind.
that's
admittedly
a
20th
century
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
monaghan.
ms.
boleyn.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
a
very
specific
position,
ms.
boleyn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
existence
of
the
original
habeas
jurisdiction
in
this
court
after
this
act
of
congress
was
passed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
ex
parte
yerger?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish
ex
parte
yerger
from
this
case
on
the
jurisdictional
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
familiar
with
the
yerger
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
yerger,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
said
that
the
repeal
effected
in
the
statute
considered
in
the
mccardle
case,
which
had
repealed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
hear
an
appeal
from
a
lower
court
decision
denying
certiorari,
in
yerger
they
said,
well,
that's
true,
congress
took
away
that
appellate
jurisdiction,
but
it
didn't
take
away
our
original
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
wouldn't
we
be
making
the
same
sort
of
factual,
fact-specific
determinations
on
the
prima
facie
case
issue?
it
would
just
be
removed
in
degree.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
position
basically
is
if
the
court
of
appeals
under
this
act
turns
down
the
petitioner,
that
there's
no
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
our
original
jurisdiction
even
though
it
exists,
because
he
had
another
avenue
of
relief
but
he
was
found
to
not
meet
the
standards
for
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mandamus
is
no
more
readily
granted
here
than
original
habeas
corpus,
i
think.
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
way
around
the
difficulty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
boleyn.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
a
state
court
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
this
is
a
very
kind
of
confused
point
in
our
cases,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
have
to
have
some...
if
it
is
indeed
appellate
jurisdiction,
we
have
to
have
somewhere
where
the
prisoner
has
been
ordered
confined.
your
thought
is,
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
that
confined
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
they
said
there
that
you...
it's
a
review
of
the
decision
refusing
the
writ.
i
mean,
there
were--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--those
decisions
in...
but
wouldn't...
it
seems
to
me
the
most
logical
analysis
to...
analogy
to
that
is
to
say
it
is
the
court
of
appeals
which
has
refused
to
allow
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--issuance
of
the
writ--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
habeas
corpus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
10...
that
portion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
