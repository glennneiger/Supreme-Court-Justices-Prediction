justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
do
you
think
of
the
suggestion
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
the
statute
really
means
that
you
can
get
relief
if
you
present
new
evidence
that
ought
to
substantially
undermine
the
reviewing
court's
faith
in
the
fundamental
justice
of
the
verdict?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
a
suggestion
that
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
the
statute
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there
a
way
of
getting
to
there
with
the
words
of
the
statute
as
they
are?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is
a
judgment.
there's
a
judgment
of
the
state
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
if,
in
fact,
a
person
files
a
writ
of
original
jurisdiction
and
he
says,
read
my
papers,
new
section
106
totally
applies,
i
satisfy
everything,
i
have
some
brand
new
evidence
that
shows
i'm
completely
innocent,
a
prima
facie
case
is
made
out
and
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
erred
in
denying
me
the
right
to
go
to
the
district
court,
file
that
in
our
court.
do
we
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
it?
yes
or
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
from
your
brief
the
answer
was
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
answer's
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand,
then.
i
didn't
perhaps
understand
you.
what
do
you
say
happens
in
the
very
unusual
case
where
a
person
comes
in
with
totally
convincing
evidence
at
the
eleventh
hour
that
all
the
state's
witnesses
are
not
telling
the
truth,
or
something...
that
could
happen...
and
thus
meets
the
standards
of
106,
meets
all
those
standards,
the
certificate,
though,
is
denied,
and
he
comes
to
us
and
asks
us
to
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
under
our
original
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
this
is
a
very
unusual
case
where
all
the
evidence
was
no
good,
and
all
the
standards
are
met?
i
ask
you,
do
we
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that,
and
is
your
answer
yes,
or
is
it
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
your
brief
suggested
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
that
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
to
do
that,
given
you're
here
and
everything
is...
i'm
just
asking
you
to
explain,
just
want
you
wanted
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
sorry,
the
case
i'm
quoting
is
106
is
met.
the
petitioner
proves
in
his
view
that
under
106
he's
entitled
to
the
writ.
his
claim
is,
under
106
i
should
get
the
writ,
the
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
give
it
to
me,
he
asks
us
to
review
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
in
yerger
what
was...
why
i'm
confused
about
it
is
that
yerger
says
that
the
1868
act,
that
was
the
act
at
issue
there,
repeals
so
much
of
the
act
as
authorizes
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
to
the
supreme
court,
so
there
they
seem
to
repeal
the
section
that
would
authorize
an
appeal,
and
yet
it
was
still
in
our
appellate
jurisdiction.
that
was
what
was
confusing
me.
so
i
thought
perhaps
what
we're
reviewing
is
where
you
started
out.
it's
in
our
appellate
jurisdiction
because--
