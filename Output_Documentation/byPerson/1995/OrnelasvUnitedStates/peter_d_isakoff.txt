mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
a
federal
court,
federal
district
court
conclusion
as
to
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
ought
to
be
reviewed
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
or
de
novo.
the
circuits
are
divided
on
this.
they
have
been
shifting
somewhat.
they've
been
inconsistent
among
themselves,
or
within
their
own
circuits.
the
seventh
circuit
staked
out
a
very
clear
position
for
clearly
erroneous
review
in
this
particular
context,
and
i
submit
that
this
court
should
affirm.
it
is
helpful
in
addressing
this
issue
just
to
briefly
review
the
characteristics
of
the
opposing
standards.
de
novo
review
means
that
when
you
get
to
the
bottom
line,
if
the
court
of
appeals
thinks
that
the
district
court
applied
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
in
the
wrong
way
to
the
facts,
that
it
would
reverse.
clearly
erroneous
review
is,
by
definition,
more
deferential.
the
reviewing
court
may
not
reverse
simply
because
it
thinks
it
would
have
decided
the
case
differently.
where
there's
more
than
one
permissible
view
of
the
evidence,
it
is
obliged
to
defer,
but
i
think
that
it's
implicit
in
some
of
the
questions
that
i
heard
addressed
to
opposing
counsel
that
clearly
erroneous
review
is
not
tantamount
to
no
review.
where
ar
appellate
court
sees
that
there's
been
a
legal
error,
or
that
there's
a
legal
principle
that
would
decide
the
case
differently--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--well,
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
it's
certainly
possible
that
you
could
get
that
kind
of
review.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
could
be
the
occasion
for
defining
what
a
court
of
appeals
is
supposed
to
do
in
performing
a
clearly
erroneous
review,
and
when
i
was
talking
about
questions
of
law
perhaps
affecting
the
analysis
of
the
probable
cause
issue,
i
think
of
justice
scalia's
example
of
the
turntable,
with
whether
or
not
you've
got
something,
whether
it
amounts
to
a
search.
that
narrow
question
can
be
considered
to
be
a
legal
question,
when
you
pick
up
the
turntable
and
look
at
the
thing
that's
not
in
plain
view.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
you...
there
may
be
a
distinction
between
whether
something
constitutes
a
search
for
purposes
of
whether
you
pick
the
de
novo
or
clearly
erroneous
review
versus
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
determinations.
and
part
of
the
reason
for
that
is
the
history
that
was
recited
by
this
court
in
illinois
v.
gates,
where
this
court
had
attempted
to
look
for
recurring
fact
patterns
and
to
try
to
develop
a
set
of
rules
that
would
provide
the
kind
of
guidance
that
opposing
counsel
have
suggested
is
provided
in
each
one
of
these
highly
fact-specific
cases.
and
the
court's
experience
was
that
it
was
becoming
impossible
to
kind
of
draw
these
distinctions
on
appeal,
and
that
we
have
to
adopt
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
rule
specifically
recognizing
that
these
fact
patterns
really
do
vary
from
situation
to
situation
and
that,
while
you
think
you
may
be
identifying
a
common
fact
pattern,
in
fact
there
may
be
many,
many
variables.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
i--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--i
think
that
there's
a
point
that
is
lost
in
that
argument
ms.
pillard
made,
and
that
is
that
nobody
is
talking
about
adopting
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review
on
appeal,
of
deferring
to
the
actions
of
a
police
officer.
nobody
is
suggesting
that
unless
the
police
officer
was
clearly
erroneous,
we're
going
to
permit
the
evidence
in.
this
is
a
question
of
deferring
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
article
iii
judge
after
a
full
adversary
presentation,
which
i
would
submit
is
far
more
extensive
even
than
considered
by
magistrates,
and
the
whole
point
of
it
is
that
you're
deferring
not
to
a
police
officer
but
to
a
district
court.
and
in
terms
of
encouraging
the
exercise
of
warrants,
the
very
fact
that
there
might
be
uncertainty
in
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not,
when
you
have
all
of
these
circumstances,
were
they
ever
to
arise
again,
suggests
that
these
police
officers,
if
they
want
to
be
certain,
should
go
out
and
get
a
warrant,
and
once
they
get
a
warrant,
then
they've
got
all
of
the
protection
of--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--yes.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
i
think
that
that's
not
quite
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
habeas
corpus
cases,
where
you
are
defining
what
is
a
fact
issue
by
2254(d),
which
then
goes
back
to
townsend
v.
sain,
and
where
you're
looking
at
how
much
you're
going
to
give
to
the
state
courts
to
do
without
independent
federal
review
there,
i
think
all...
in
all
of
the
situations
where
you're
looking
at
juror
bias
or
that
kind
of
thing,
you
are
saying
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law
are
subject
to
de
novo
review
by
a
federal
district
court
in
habeas
corpus,
okay.
that's
one
situation.
but
the
other
situation,
even
though
it's
the
same
type
of
issue,
i
submit
has
been
resolved
differently
by
this
court,
that
the
criterion
that
the
court
has
used
is,
who's
in
the
best
position
to
decide
the
question,
and
is
the
decision
going
to
be
of
precedential
significance,
because
as
long
as
you're
going
to
have
three
judges
spend
their
time
trying
to
scratch
their
heads
and
decide
whether
the
court
was
right
or
not
in
close
cases,
you
ought
to
at
least
be
getting
something
for
it.
and
i
would
suggest
also
that
we
are
talking
about
the
close
cases
by
definition,
since
it's
only
in
the
cases
where
two
permissible
results
could
be
the
outcome
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
de
novo
standard
and
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
so
it's
hard
to
see
how
you're
going
to
get
very
many
precedents
coming
out
of
just
those
close
cases.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
certainly
the
bose
and
the
hardhanks
decision
that
followed
it
and
justice
stevens'
very
clear
language
was
that
this
was
a
unique
interest
that's
being
protected
by
the
actual
malice
standard,
that
this
court
in
particular
has
an
obligation
to
be
sure
that
this
core
value
of
being
able
to
criticize
public
officials
be
given
the
fullest
protection.
i
would
submit
that,
in
contrast
to
the
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
type
determinations,
which
are
specifically
nontechnical
in
nature,
that
until
at
least
this
court
has
given
guidance
perhaps
in
a
series
of
cases,
that
the
first
amendment
cases
simply
pose
a
different
type
of
issue,
and
i
would
agree
that
it
is
an
exception.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
correct.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
the--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--no,
they--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--well,
i--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--well,
i
think
the
difference
is
in
the
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
gets
to
the
bottom
line,
they've
looked
at
the
historical
facts
as
they've
been
found
or
conceded
to
be
and
where
there
is
more
than
one
permissible
view,
where
the
question
is
close,
that
that's
the
case
you
leave
it
to
the
district
court.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
in
fact--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--well,
the
difference,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the...
you're
supposed
to
be
reviewing
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
kind
of
a
judgment,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court
is
in
the
best
position
because
he's
at
least
had
the
chance
to
ask
how
askew,
or
even
look
at
how
askew,
and
then
weighing
all
of
that
together--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--i
think
that
the
district
court
really
is
in
the
better
position
to
do
it,
and
then
these
cases
that
are
close,
you're
not
really
getting
the
precedentially
significant
decisions
out
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
it's
interesting,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
courts
of
appeals,
whether
prompted
by
this
court
or
otherwise,
have
been
paying
much
more
attention
to
standard
review
issues.
i
know
that,
for
example,
the
third
circuit
has
a
rule
that
in
every
brief
you
must
have
a
little
introductory
section
on
the
standard
of
review,
and
i
was
in
an
oral
argument
last
week
where
i
was
listening
to
somebody
else's
case
and
they
were
saying,
well,
you
know,
we
might
come
out
one
way
if
it's
abuse
of
discretion
and
another
way
if
it's
de
novo
or
if
it's
plenary.
and
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
are
paying
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
it,
and
frankly
i
think
they
are
highlighting
an
issue
of,
you
know,
federal
judicial
administration
here,
really,
who
is
in
the
best
position
to
decide
these
questions.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
i
think
what's
deferential
is
when
you
get
to
the
bottom
line,
because
the
bottom
line
in
this
case
i
think
is
arguably
close.
i
think
at
the
point
where
if
you
leave
out
the
naddis
hits
and
all
you've
got
is
an
automobile
in
milwaukee
with
california
license
plates
in
december,
and
that's
all
you've
got,
then
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
essentially
saying
is,
if
you
found
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
on
that
basis
alone,
we
would
be
saying
that's
clearly
erroneous.
and
i
think
that
it
underscores,
frankly,
that
the
whole
notion
that
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
exercising
de
novo
review
in
order
to
have
this
expositor
of
the
law
function
is
wrong.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
the
only
problem
with
picking
one
out,
your
honor,
is
that
i
don't
think
the
courts
of
appeals
have
the
luxury
that
this
court
does
of
picking
and
choosing
the
cases
that
come
before
it.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
i
think
your
honor
makes
a
good
point
that,
whether
you
call
it
clearly
erroneous
or
de
novo
review,
the
ultimate
bottom
line
is,
are
you
going
to...
do
you
think
that
the
district
court's
in
the
better
position
or
not.
but
i
think
that
the
development
of
these
labels
has
come
to
the
point
where
these
concepts
have
enough
meaning
that
when
you've
got
the
development
of
the
law
to
the
point
where
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
have,
and
you
see
that
it's
a
fact-bound
area
that
resists
specific
rules,
that
it's
appropriate
specifically
to
tell
the
courts
of
appeals
that
this
is
an
area
where
we
think
that
the
district
courts
are
in
the
better
position,
and
we
don't
think
that
in
most
cases
you're
going
to
have
much
precedential
significance
to
drawing
the
line
in
these
close
cases
one
way
or
the
other
because
these
situations
are
not
going
to
arise
exactly
the
same
way
again.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well,
i
think
that...
i
think
there's
some
truth
to
that,
particularly
when
you
go
back
to
cases
as
far
as
brineger
and
before
you
had
the
history
that
led
up
through
aguilar
and
spinelli
to
illinois
v.
gates,
where
i
think
there
may
have
been
a
recognition
that
the
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
determinations
were
really
not
susceptible
of
the
kind
of
precedential
significance
that
i
think
in
brineger
the
majority
of
the
court
found,
and
in
that
case,
it
was
different
from
that,
justice
stevens.
in
that
case,
they
lined
up
the
facts
in
carroll,
and
they
lined
up
the
facts
in
brineger,
and
they
said,
unless
we're
going
to
say
that
this
is
for
the
trial
court
to
decide,
we
can't
distinguish
these,
and
therefore
we
must
reverse,
and
justice
jackson
in
dissent
made
the
very
point
that
i'm
frankly
arguing
for
today,
which
is
that
the
difference
is
that
we
only
said
in
carroll
that
it
was
permissible
to
make
this
finding,
and
i
think
that's
a
big
difference.
in
this
case,
i
would
affirm
because
it's
permissible,
but
you
didn't
have
to
find
it,
and
i
think
that
that
dissent
was
very
prescient.
i
think
that
it
picked
up
the
theme
that
later
drove
the
court's
decision
in
illinois
v.
gates
to
reject
aguilar
and
spinelli.
so
i
think
that
the
law
has
progressed
somewhat,
in
that
i
think
there
is
something
useful
to
be
said
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
in
response,
i
believe
to
justice
kennedy,
there
was
a
question,
i
believe
whether
the
court
should
take
into
account
deficiencies
that
a
clearly
erroneous
rule
would
have.
i
would
suggest
that
certainly
that
that
would
not
be
a
justification
in
and
of
itself.
i
would
suggest
that
where
the
district
court
is
in
a
better
position
to
decide
the
question
and
the
courts
of
appeals
are
not
really
making
precedent,
that
it's
certainly
not
unreasonable
to
give
the
guidance
to
say,
look,
you
don't
have
to
try
to
make
these
fine
distinctions
on
appeal,
particularly
since
you
weren't
there
to
raise
what
additional
questions
might
have
come
to
mind
like,
how
loose
was
the
panel,
and
so
on.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
i
think
that
the
district
court,
in
reviewing
the
case
where
there
is
no
warrant,
is
not
going
to
be
applying
nearly
the
same
kind
of
standard
that
you
would
be
doing
on
review
of
a
magistrate's
order.
in
other
words,
the
district
court
will
be
using
the
word
de
novo,
will
be
employing
de
novo
review
and
reviewing
the
work
of
the
police.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
point
you've
got
an
extremely
fact-bound
totality
of
the
circumstances
decision
that's
been
made
by
the
person
who's
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
the
questions,
to
develop
the
record
as
he
or
she
sees
fit,
who
is
in
a
position
to
make
the
kind
of
weighted
assessment,
and
where
you're
really
not
going
to
be
getting...
look,
if
the
district
court
is
wrong,
and
is
clearly
wrong,
or
has
made
a
legal
error
that
affects
the
analysis
or
has
said
something
isn't
a
search
when
it
is
a
search,
then
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
is
perfectly
adequate
to
correct
that.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
well--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--the
appellate
court
should
defer
to
the
district
court
for
the
following
reason.
the
district
court
was
obliged,
by
reason
of
the
statute
and
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
raddatz,
to
make
a
de
novo
determination,
and
as
long
as
he
was
not
rejecting
any
credibility
findings
of
the
magistrate,
it's
settled
that
he
does
not
need
to
rehear
that
testimony.
he
certainly
read,
and
it's
clear
that
he
did,
the
testimony
of
the
one
officer
who
had
felt
this
loose
panel
and
whose
testimony
was
really
the
pivot
point
of
this
case,
and
you
know,
we've...
the
court
in
anderson
v.
bessemer
says
you've
got
to
defer
to
the
trial
court
among
other
things
because
the
trial
court's
the
one
who
develops
the
expertise
of
doing
this
kind
of
fact-intensive
decisionmaking
on
an
every
day
basis.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
because...
and
i
honestly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
no,
your
honor--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--because
the
only--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--well,
there's
two
points.
first
of
all,
the
expertise
the
court
was
talking
about
in
anderson
v.
bessemer
wasn't
talking
about
expertise
in
the
particular
case,
but
because
that's
the
district
court's
every
day
job,
and
the
second
point
is
that
even
though
the
district
court
here
chose
not
to
hear
any
testimony,
he
was
certainly
in
a
position
to
do
so
if
he
wanted,
which
is
not
an
option
that
was
available
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
there's
no
question
that
when
you
look
at
this
particular
case
you
could
reach
that
conclusion
and
decide
that,
well,
we
ought
to
maybe
have
one
standard
for
when
the
district
court
hear's
the
testimony
and
another
standard
for
when
the
magistrate
hears
the
testimony,
and
yet
another
standard
for
when
they
disagree
with
one
another
only
on
the
label
but
not
on
the
credibility.
but
i
think
of
your
honors'
decision
last
term,
and
the
name
of
the
case
doesn't
come
to
mind
right
now,
but
where
you,
i
believe,
suggested
that
you
should
not
have...
it
was
the
arbitration
case,
where
you
said
it
would
be
unduly
complicated
to
have
so
many
different
standards,
but
i
think
that
the
possibility
of
error
may
be
greater
in
reviewing
a
district
court
where
he
has
not
heard
the
testimony.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
oh,
i--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--i
certainly
do
not...
i'm
not
aware
of
any
decision
of
this
court
that
has
suggested
that
the
deference
is
limited
in
the
manner
your
honor
suggests.
i
have
certainly
read
illinois
v.
gates
as
saying
that
there's
a
substantial
basis
for
the
warrant,
we're
going
to
defer
to
the
magistrate's
decision
to
issue
it,
and
when
you
consider
that
that
was
then
followed
by
united
states
v.
leon,
where
a
police
officer
acting,
you
know,
with
a
facially
valid
warrant
is
going
to--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--well,
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
different
policy
because
i--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--it
seems
to
me
that
it's
the
same
policy--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--that
in
both
cases
the
court
was
coming
very
strongly,
as
it
has
historically,
in
favor
of
encouraging
people
to
get
warrants.
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
yes.
i
mean--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--i
think
at
that
point,
if
you're
looking
at
a
police
officer
who
knows
that
he
has
lied
to
the
magistrate--
mr.
peter
d.
isakoff
--that
that
would
be
a
different
thing,
but
i
think
in
both
cases
that
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
type
of
deference
that
your
honor
was
suggesting
has
been
limited
to
simply
filling
in
the
blanks.
i
don't
think
the
court
was
that
specific
in
either
case.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
ask
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
