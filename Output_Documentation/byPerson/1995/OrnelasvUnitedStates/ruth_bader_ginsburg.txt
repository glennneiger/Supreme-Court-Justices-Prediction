justice
ginsburg
--ms.
pillard,
you
said
there
were
two
other
reasons,
and
your
time
is
running
out,
so
perhaps
you
might
mention
them.
justice
ginsburg
is
it
different
from
the
standard
that's
used
when
the
court
is
determining
whether
a
warrant
was
backed
by
probable
cause?
justice
ginsburg
mr.
isakoff,
doesn't
this
very
case,
though,
illustrate
that
the
court
of
appeals
sometimes
is?
i'm
really
puzzled
by
the
significance
of
the
labels,
too,
as
are
other
people,
but
if
i
ever
saw
a
nice
precedent
it
was
judge
posner's
here,
because
he
said,
if
you
have
these
four,
five
factors,
and
you
didn't
have
the
two
naddis
hits,
it
wouldn't
be
enough.
so
now
the
district
court
knows
that
this
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
if
that's
all
you
have,
it's
not
enough.
it's
a
really
nice
precedential
decision,
and
yet
this
is
described
as
deferential
review.
it's
very
puzzling.
justice
ginsburg
mr.
isakoff,
do
you
think
it's
appropriate
to
have
a
different
standard,
whatever
the
label
is,
to
review
more
closely
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
warrant?
justice
ginsburg
but
once
you
get
past
the
district
court
level,
it
should
make
no
difference
whether
it's
a
warrant
case
or
a
warrantless
search.
