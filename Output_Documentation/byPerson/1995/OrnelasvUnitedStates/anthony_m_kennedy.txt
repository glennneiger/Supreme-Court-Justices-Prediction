justice
kennedy
well,
surely
there
are
no
aspects
of
fourth
amendment
doctrine,
be
it
the
lawfulness
of
the
stop,
the
lawfulness
of
the
search
that
follows
the
stop,
that
couldn't
and
wouldn't
have
been
developed
had
we
used
the
de
novo...
pardon
me,
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
of
review
in
the
circuit
courts
all
this
time.
justice
kennedy
well,
doesn't
it
develop
in
the
same
way?
do
you
really
think
that
the
doctrine
of
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
would
look
any
different
today
had
we
been
proceeding
under
a
clearly
erroneous
review
standard?
justice
kennedy
why
is
that,
and
in
what
respects?
justice
kennedy
well,
take
this
case.
judge
posner's
opinion
was
very,
very
helpful
and
lucid.
if
he
had
been
operating
under
a
different
standard,
the
one
that
you
contend
for,
de
novo
review,
would
he
have
said
anything
different?
would
any
different
legal
positions
have
emerged
that
would
be
more
helpful
to
the
system?
justice
kennedy
well...
sorry.
justice
kennedy
were
you
finished?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
could
have
done
that
with
judge
posner's
opinion
in
this
case,
could
you
not?
justice
kennedy
is
it
relevant
for
us
to
consider
the
present
work
load
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
deciding
this
case?
justice
kennedy
suppose
we
disagree
with
that.
is
it
a
relevant
consideration?
justice
kennedy
in
other
words,
we
decide
this
case
quite
without
regard
to
the
comparative
efficiencies
of
requiring
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
courts
to
write
all
these
things
out,
as
justice
breyer
has
explained.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
assume
that's
because
they
think
that
that's
what
we
would
require,
but
the
question--
justice
kennedy
has...
do
you
think
that's
what
has
been
going
on--
justice
kennedy
--prior
to
the
labeling
era?
