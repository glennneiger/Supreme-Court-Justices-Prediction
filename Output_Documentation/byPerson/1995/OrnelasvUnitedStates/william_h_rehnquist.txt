chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
95-5257,
saul
ornelas
and
ismael
ornelas-ledesma
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
lebell,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lebell,
it
seems
to
me
in...
either
the
magistrate
or
the
district
judge
made
a
finding
of
fact
as
to
credibility.
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
that
particular
finding
be
reviewed
de
novo,
would
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
a
direct
appeal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
can
see
why
you
argue
naturally
for
plenary
review,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
could
derive
much
support
from
a
holding
that
was
based
on
the
federal
habeas
statute,
which
this
isn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
maybe
those
would
be
better
cases
for
you
to
rely
on,
then.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
what
court
made
the
determination
of
clearly
erroneous
in
cortez?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
district
court,
or
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lebell.
ms.
pillard.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
do
we
need
specific
content
to
be
given?
why
isn't
it
sufficient
to
say
reasonable
suspicion,
and
just
have
an
ad
hoc
decision
in
every
case?
why
do
we
need
more
elaboration
of
the
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
ms.
pillard,
take
probable
cause,
which
is
certainly
very
much
tied
up
with
the
fourth
amendment.
with
the
exception
of
one-half
sentence
from
an
opinion
of
john
marshall,
we
have
never
defined
probable
cause,
and
we
get
along
fine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we've--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--in
certain...
but
what,
in
your
view,
is
the
way
this
court
has
defined...
how
have
we
defined
probable
cause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
agree,
then,
that
there
has
been
no
overriding
or
sweeping
definition
of
probable
cause,
just
in
words.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--has
this
court
said,
what
is
probable
cause?
has
it
answered
that
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
don't
think--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
very
fact-specific
ways,
and
is
there
any
reason
why
we
just
shouldn't
keep
on
doing
that
in
the
area
of
probable
cause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.
pillard--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--ms.
pillard,
why
is
it
that
we
need
to
either
opt
for
de
novo
review
or
deference?
why
don't
we
just
keep
on
reviewing
these
cases
the
way
we
have,
and
the
court
repeals
the
way
we...
it
may
not
always
be
neat,
but
it
seems
to
work
pretty
well.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we've
certainly
never
said
we
exercise
de
novo
review
in
fourth
amendment,
in
particular
fourth
amendment
cases,
have
we?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pillard.
mr.
isakoff.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
courts
really
were
never
troubled
with
this
problem
until
either
some
appellate
judges
school
said
let's
figure
out
what
the
standard
of
review
is,
and
then
we
say,
well,
it's
deferential,
or
it's
de
novo.
courts
never
bothered
to
think
about
that
for
a
long
time,
and
they
got
along
fine.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
isakoff.
we
appreciate
your
appearing
as
amicus.
mr.
lebell,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lebell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
