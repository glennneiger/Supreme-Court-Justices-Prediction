justice
o'connor
mr.
isakoff,
this
is
a
typical
sort
of
a
mixed
fact-law
matter,
isn't
it,
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
o'connor
and
we
certainly
have
traditionally
at
least
said
that
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law
will
be
reviewed
by
the
appellate
court
on
a
de
novo
standard.
justice
o'connor
mr.
isakoff,
this
case
presents
a
situation
where
the
magistrate
made
one
finding
of
fact
and
the
district
court
on
review,
without
having
heard
the
evidence
directly,
made
a
different
one,
changed
the
result.
justice
o'connor
to
whom
should
the
appellate
court
defer?
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
split
of
authority
in
the
circuits,
to
your
knowledge,
that
turns
on
this
peculiar
situation
of
the
district
court
differing
from
the
magistrate?
