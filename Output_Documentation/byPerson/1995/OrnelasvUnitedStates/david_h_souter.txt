justice
souter
but
the
legal
errors
are
going
to
be
rather
few
and
far
between.
i
mean,
the
ultimate
legal
error
is
simply
the
ultimate
issue
of
probable
cause
or
not
probable
cause,
and
that's
a
pretty
blunt
instrument.
justice
souter
isn't
the
case
that
when
we
say,
as
some
people
here
have
suggested,
and
i
suppose
as
i
have
on
some
times,
that
you
can
still
give
your
views
as
a
court
if
you're
applying
a
clearly
erroneous
standard?
isn't
it
really
the
case
that
courts
that
do
that
are
indulging
in
a
lot
of
dicta,
that
they're
going
to
have
a
lot
to
say,
and
they're
either
going
to
have
to
follow
that
by
saying,
nonetheless,
that
isn't
the
way
the
lower
court
viewed
it
and
even
though
we
think
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
concluded
another
way,
we'll
let
it
stand,
or
they're
going
to
say,
yes,
we
think
they
applied
it
rather
badly,
and
it's
so
bad
that
we're
going
to
call
it
clear
error,
in
which
case
they're
not
really
going
to
be
following
a
clear
error
standard
at
all,
they're
going
to
kind
of
jump
into
de
novo
whenever
they
want
to
come
up
with
an
illustrative
case,
while
still
calling
it
clear
error.
isn't
that
the
kind
of,
sort
of
protean
court
of
appeals
review
that
we're
going
to
get,
either
a
lot
of
dicta,
or
a
lot
of
departure
from
doing
what
we're
saying
we're
doing?
justice
souter
yes,
but
the
question
in
that
case
was
the
degree
of
intrusion,
and
you're
going
to
say,
well,
there
was
just
a
wee
bit
of
intrusion
when
he
looked
under
it,
and
therefore
it
was
clearly
erroneous
to
say
that
you
had
not
sort
of
departed
from
your
reasonable
standard.
that's
kind
of
tough.
i
think
that
that
strikes
me
as
sort
of
crossing
the
line
into
de
novo
review,
even
though
you're
not
saying
that's
what
you're
doing.
justice
souter
but
that
gets
us
into
the
different
issue
which
ms.
pillard
raised,
and
that
is,
there
is
a
good
reason
to
have
a
more
intrusive
review
standard
when
one
is
reviewing
a
warrantless
search
than
in
the
case
of
a
search
with
a
warrant
and
therefore,
even
though
it
may
in
fact,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
am
convinced
of
this,
but
even
though
it
may,
in
fact,
be
more
difficult,
really,
to
do
de
novo
review,
there's
a
good
reason
to
do
it
in
order
to
preserve
that
distinction,
isn't
there?
justice
souter
you
want
to
encourage
warrants.
justice
souter
do
you
think
maybe
something
like
this
has
been
going
on
at
least
before
we
got
the
courts
of
appeals
got
to
the
point
of
articulation,
that
in
most
cases
they
did
engage
in
deferential
review?
every
once
in
a
while
they
would
get
a
case
in
which
they
would
say,
the
trial
court
seems
to
be
straying
pretty
far
from
what
we
generally
think
of
as
probable
cause
here,
and
we've
got
to
take
this
case
as
an
illustration
to
show
that
they
should
have
analyzed
their
facts
differently,
or
concluded
differently,
or
whatnot,
and
in
those
cases
they
engaged
in
de
novo
review.
they
were
selecting
cases
for
de
novo
review,
and
that's
the
way
we've
gotten
along
the
way
we've
gotten
along.
every
once
in
a
while
the
courts
of
appeals
would
take
an
illustrative
case
and
they'd
really
rake
it
over.
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
leaving
a
system...
a)
do
you
think
that's
what's
been
going
on,
before
we
got
to
the
labeling
era,
and
b)
would
there
be
anything
wrong
in
leaving
it
that
way
and
saying
yes,
you
can
pick
one
out
once
in
a
while?
justice
souter
no,
i'm
not
saying
that
they
pick
and
choose
the
cases
that
come
before
them,
but
they
do
seem,
i
think...
i'm
guessing...
that
they
really
did
exercise
some
discretion
in
deciding
just
how
picky
a
standard
to
apply
when
they
did
review
them.
and
if
the
reason
for
saying,
in
some
cases
we're
going
to
be
fairly
deferential
but
in
others
we're
going
to
be
very
picky
because
we
think
something
can
be
gained
by
using
this
as
an
illustration,
if
that's
a
legitimate
ground
of
choice,
would
it
be
wrong
for
us
to
leave
them
to
make
that
choice,
even
though
they
have
to
review,
on
one
standard
or
another,
every
case
that
comes?
justice
souter
mr.
isakoff,
help
me
out
on
this.
if
i'm
wrong,
tell
me.
i
assumed
that
the
deference
which
was
given
in
a
warrant
case
to
the
conclusions,
or
the...
in
the
old
conclusion
of
the
issuing
magistrate
was
the
kind
of
deference
which
i
would
describe
by
filling
in
the
blanks
in
a
way
that
was
favorable
to
the
magistrate's
conclusion.
if,
for
example,
the
magistrate
says
the...
there
was
something
funny
about
the
panel,
and
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
funny
enough
really
to
excite
a
high
degree
of
suspicion
or
not,
when
a
court
reviews
that,
it's
going
to
say,
well,
we
assume
the
magistrate
meant
that
it
was
very
funny,
it
was
very
strange.
it
was
enough
to
say,
whoops,
there's
something...
any
reasonable
person
would
have
said
there's
something
really
wrong
with
that
panel.
people
have
been
tampering.
is
there...
i
thought
there
was
that
sort
of
filling-in-the-blanks,
or
expanding-on-the-statement
sort
of
deference,
as
distinct
from
every...
any
deference
as
to
what,
if
you
expand
or
fill
in
the
blanks,
amounts
to
probable
cause
or
not.
justice
souter
as...
do
you
understand
that
to
be
the
process
of
deference
that
goes
on?
justice
souter
but
that
was
a
different
policy,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
that
was
the
get-the-warrant
policy
as
opposed
to
the
standard-of-review
policy.
justice
souter
maybe
you
can't
draw
the
line.
i
guess
you
can't
draw
the
line.
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
no,
wait
a
minute,
maybe
i
misspoke.
i
thought
in
leon
the
deference
was
to
the
capacity
of
the
police
officer
to
believe
that
the
warrant
he
had
was
a
validly
issued
warrant,
so
that
it
was
in
that
respect
that
the
policy
was
different,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
souter
right.
