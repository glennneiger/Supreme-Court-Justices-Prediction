justice
scalia
but
that's
going
to
be
the
case
where
there
are
multifarious
factors,
and
there,
a
court
of
appeals
may
well
reverse
the
district
court,
but
to
assume
that
that's
of
any
use
to
the
system
you
have
to
posit
a
following
case
that
has
the
same
multifarious
factors,
which
doesn't
very
often
happen.
where
you
have
a
single
factor,
like
one
case
we
had
9
or...
8
or
9
years
ago
involving
whether
it's
an
unreasonable
search
when
an
officer
who
is
in
a
room
lawfully
sees
a
turntable
in
plain
view
and
opens
it
up,
you
know,
turns
it
over
to
look
at
the
bottom
to
get
the
serial
number,
that
issue...
couldn't
that
issue
be
decided
just
as
well
and
established
just
as
well
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard?
it's
an
isolated,
discrete
legal
issue.
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
well,
tell
me...
tell
me
how
the
turntable
case
could
not
have
been
decided
just
as
well
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard.
justice
scalia
well,
the
lower
court
simply
held
that
if...
that
the
police
officer
is
lawfully
in
the
room,
this
isn't
a
search
and
seizure
because
it's
a
minimal
disruption,
and
whether
you
apply
clearly
erroneous
or
de
novo,
the
fact
is
that
it's
clearly
erroneous
to
say
that
a
minimal
disruption
is
not
a
disruption.
justice
scalia
it
really
seems
to
me
that
the
only
advantage
for
making
law
that
de
novo
review
contains
is
an
advantage
when
you
assume
that
the
very
same
multiplicity
of
factors
will
be
replicated
in
the
future,
which
doesn't
very
often
happen,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
--absolutely.
i
think
that
is
de
novo,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
but
you
take
some
offense
at
the
district
court
reversing
de
novo
the
magistrate,
but
you
want
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
de
novo
the
district
court.
justice
scalia
i
find
that...
you
know.
justice
scalia
oh,
undoubted...
i
mean,
if
you
say,
you
know,
whether
once
in
a
blue
moon
you
wouldn't
get
clearer
guidance,
i'm
sure
you
would,
but
that
argues
for
de
novo
review
in
every
case.
you'd
get
some
marginal
improvement
in
legal
certainties.
justice
scalia
you
do
that
for
all
constitutional
issues,
is
that
the
position
you
take?
justice
scalia
well,
i
suppose
that
just
as
the
courts
of
appeals
have
to
bring
some
unity
to
the
district
courts,
we
have,
you
know,
a
lot
of
courts
of
appeals.
i
suppose
we
should
grant
a
significant
number
of
petitions
for
certiorari
for
the
same
reason
in
these
cases
to
decide
whether
probable...
you
know,
no
particular
issue,
but
just
whether
this
combination
of
factors
is
enough
to
constitute
probable
cause.
i
suppose
that
the
solicitor
general
would
urge
us
to
accept
cert
in
a
fair
number
of
cases.
justice
scalia
that's
a
simple,
isolable
issue
which
would
come
up
under
clearly
erroneous
review--
justice
scalia
--like
the
turntable
example.
if
there
is
a
single
factor
that
is
improperly
used,
clearly
erroneous
will
get
that,
won't
it?
justice
scalia
you
would
use
that
for
fbi
agents
in
the
fifth
circuit
as
well,
as
i
assume,
right?
justice
scalia
the
seventh
circuit
promulgates
national
standards?
justice
scalia
but
i
mean,
my
point
is,
you're
still
telling
the
fbi
agents
to
take
a
chance
that
what
the
seventh
circuit
has
said
will
be
applied
in
the
third
circuit.
justice
scalia
the
last
reason
surely
proves
too
much.
i
mean,
you
can
say
that
about
every
single
federal
legal
standard,
probable
cause,
anything,
any
constitutional
injury,
it
should
not
mean
different
things
in
different
courtrooms--
justice
scalia
--and
therefore
they
should
all
be
reviewed
de
novo.
justice
scalia
and
concluded
that
it
was
okay
if
it
meant
different
things
in
different
courtrooms,
right?
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
the
same
groups
of
factors.
i
mean,
could--
justice
scalia
--if,
indeed,
the
fact
of
a
rusted
screw
is
not
enough,
you
know,
then
you
can
say
in
the
clearly
erroneous
review,
a
rusted
screw
is
not
enough.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
i
had
thought
that
our
bose
line
of
authority
on
the
first
amendment,
where
we
said
that
in
that
area
we
will
review
these
mixed
questions
de
novo,
i
had
thought
that
was
somewhat
by
way
of
exception,
that
we
at
least
implied
that
ordinarily
that
would
not
be
the
case.
justice
scalia
but
it's
not
his
decision.
i...
frankly,
i
think
this
is
a...
i'm
not
sure
whether
police
officers...
i'm
not
sure
whether
they'd
be
on
your
side
or
on
the
other
side.
it
helps
the
district
judge
who
disfavors
the
police
officers
as
well
as
the
district
judge
who
favors
them.
justice
scalia
why...
i
mean...
and
they
pick
the
judges
they
go
to
for
the
warrants,
whereas
they
don't
pick
the
judge
that's
ultimately
going
to
make
this
determination.
justice
scalia
the
police
officers?
well--
