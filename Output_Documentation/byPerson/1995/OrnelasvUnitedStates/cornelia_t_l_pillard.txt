ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
determinations
of
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
to
search
without
a
warrant
are
subject
to
de
novo
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
there
are
three
closely
related
reasons
why
de
novo
review
is
the
correct
standard
here.
first
is
the
role
of
the
courts
of
appeals
as
an
expositor
of
the
law.
the
level
of
suspicion
required
to
justify
a
stop
or
a
search
is
a
very
general
standard,
and
it's
only
through
the
process
of
case-by-case
adjudication
that
specific
content
over
patterns
of
cases
can
be
given
to
the--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
think
there
are
two
reasons
for
that,
justice
rehnquist.
first
is
the
need
to
have
uniform
standards
from
court
to
court,
and
the
second
is
the
need
of
law
enforcement
in
applying
those
very
general
standards
to
have
some
guidance
as
to
what
those
standards
mean,
and
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
that.
because
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
clear
error
standard,
we're
left
not
really
knowing
what
the
court
of
appeals
itself
thought
was
the
correct
result.
it
thought
that
the
district
court's
decision
fell
within
a
range
of
permissible
results,
but
we
don't
know
whether
the
court
thought
it
was
ideal,
and
that
leaves
law
enforcement
officers,
when
they
do
confront
this
type
of
situation
again,
not
knowing
whether,
if
the
district
court
in
the
other...
in
the
second
case
were
to
suppress,
would
the
court
of
appeals
reverse
that
or
not.
so
we're
left
with
a
more
murky
standard
than
we
would
have
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
under
the
de
novo
standard.
we'd
have
clearer
guidance,
and
federal
law
enforcement
officers--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--we
think
that
it's
worth
the
effort
that
in
de
novo
review
you
do
get
clearer
guidance
and
that,
in
fact,
the
experience
of
law
enforcement--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--we're
here
arguing
that
you
do
this
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
for
probable
cause,
for
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
used
in
analyzing
the
standard
of
review
question,
that
we
think
there
is
important
precedent
to
be
generated,
and
that
the
guidance
that
that
gives
to
law
enforcement
is
very
helpful.
law
enforcement--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--we're
not
arguing
for
a
change
in
the
certiorari
standard.
it
may
be
that
there
are
situations
where
you
see
a
repeat
pattern,
airport
stops,
bus
stops,
or
traffic
stops
without
a
traffic
violation,
where
the
court
will
think,
this
is
something
that's
come
up
so
many
times--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it's
true
that
some
general
rules,
under
the
outlines
of
the
fourth
amendment
standard
will
emerge
under
the
clear
error
standard,
but
the
plain
review
doctrine
is
a
much
more
distinctly
legal
doctrine.
here,
people
are
really
focusing
on
the
application
of
this
very
general
probable
cause
standard,
and
how
do
we
give
that
content.
it's
important
to
note
that
the
experience
of
the
federal
government
in
training
our
officers,
the
fba
officers...
fbi
officers
and
the
dea
agents
is
that
in
training
them
on
what
the
content
is
of
probably
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion,
they
have
to
teach
by
illustration.
they
take
the
kinds
of
circumstances
that
these
officers
run
into,
and
they
give
them
decided
court
cases
to
show
them
this--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--you
could,
but
the
precedential
value
would
be
clearer.
as
i
mentioned,
i
think,
if
the...
it
we
knew
that
the
seventh
circuit
thought
that
this
was
the
right
way
to
conduct
this
stop
and
this
search,
then
the
officers--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--this...
these
are
national
standards,
and
the--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
do
mean
the
same
thing.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
you
are,
but
the
circuits
in
fact
are
very
much
guided
by
one
another.
if
you
look
at
the
courts
of
appeals
cases,
they
cross-cite,
and
the
state
cases
cross-cite
as
well.
what
they
do
is,
they
look
for
closely
analogous
fact
circumstances,
and
they
ask
themselves,
well,
we
have
a
few
different
facts
here,
we
do
need
to
look
at
the
totality,
but
are
we
on
the
more
suspicious
side
of
the
line
here
or
the
less
suspicious.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
that's
the
standard
form
of
reasoning
in
these
cases.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
in
the
context
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
searches
and
stops,
there's
a
fourth
amendment
requirement
of
articulation
of
the
reasons
for
the
stop
and
the
search.
the
officer...
it's
not
enough
that
the
officer,
in
fact,
has
reasons.
the
officer
has
to
articulate
those
reasons,
and
they
should
be
reflected
in
the
record.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
well,
given,
in
particular
in
this
area,
that
the
norm
of
requiring
articulation,
i
think
that
that's
something
that
is
going
to
be
less
likely
to
be
lost
here
in
the
translation,
and
you
know,
the
countervailing
concerns
are
that
these
are
followed
as
precedent
and
that,
yes,
there
will
be
bases
for
distinguishing,
and
you
see
courts
all
the
time
saying
yes,
this
looks
close,
but
we
have
more
here,
or
we
have
less
here.
but
given
that
there's
some
scope
in
choosing
the
de
novo
standard
for
having
the
kind
of
additional
clarity
the
importance
of
which
this
court
emphasized
as
recently
as
the
thompson
v.
keohane
case--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well,
i
would
beg
to
differ.
i
think
this
court
has
in
opinion
after
opinion--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--given
definition
to
probable
cause--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--in
certain
fact
settings.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
in
a
case-by-case
elaboration
process.
for
example--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well,
there
have
been
subrules,
for
example,
that
the
inferences
should
be
drawn
from
the
perspective
of
a
reasonable
law
enforcement
officer
rather
than
from
the
perspective
of
a
law
person
or
law
professor--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--and
those
kinds
of
rules--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
don't
think
so.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
it's
answered
it
in
a
bunch
of
fact
patterns.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
that
we
should
and
we
will
keep
on
doing
that,
and
the
question
is
whether,
when
the
court
does
that,
for
example
as
it
did
in
the
carroll
case
dealing
with
the
illegal
transportation
of
liquor,
and
then
came
up
with
a
fact
pattern
in
brineger
which
the
court
viewed
as
indistinguishable
from
the
carroll
case,
in
brineger
the
court
said
if
probable
cause
is
to
mean
the
same
thing
from
one
courtroom
to
another,
we're
going
to
have
to
reverse
the
district
court's
finding
of
no
probable
cause
in
this
case
and
follow
carroll,
and
that's
the
kind
of
development
of
the
law
that
we
think
the
de
novo
standard
facilitates,
and
we
think
the
court
should
continue
to
carry
on
in
that
case.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
well,
we
don't
think
that
it
would
be
appreciably
more
work
to
have--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
relevant--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it's
worth
note
in
that
regard
that
in
my
most
recent
check
i
think
every
court
of
appeals
except
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
their
most
current
statements
of
the
rule
are
applying
the
de
novo--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
think
they
often
find
it
useful.
i
think
they
find
it
useful
for
precisely
the
reasons
that
i've
been
arguing,
that
they
think
it's
needed
to
advance
clarity
in
this
area
and
to
give
some
uniform
guidance
and
some
stability
to
precedent.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i've
had
some
opportunity
to
cover
them.
they
are
the
guidance
that's
needed
by
law
enforcement,
and
the
uniformity
of
the
law,
that
the
fourth
amendment
should
not
mean
different
things
in
different
courtrooms
simply
because
one
judge
takes
a
position
that
a
certain
quantum
of
information
amounts
to
reasonable
suspicion
and
another
judge
dealing
with
identical
facts--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--yes,
but--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--not
exactly.
this
court
in
pierce
v.
underwood
and
in
cooter
&
gell
looked
at
the
kinds
of
fact
situations
involved
there,
which
were
the
application
of
rule
11
in
a
particular
litigation,
or
the
application
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act,
and
to--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well,
determined
really
that
you
don't
have
the
kind
of
vp
fact
patterns
that
create
any
kind
of
meaningful
disuniformity
from
courtroom
to
courtroom.
so
it
was
more
that
when
you
look
at
the
whole
litigation
you're
dealing
with
a
much
more
unique
animal
than
when
you
deal
with
the
kinds
of
patterns
of
crime
that
law
enforcement
are
investigating
where
they
see
the
same
kinds
of
indicia
again
and
again,
and
the
same
kinds
of
groups
of
factors
again
and
again,
and
they
really
need
to
have
some
guidance
in
applying
these
very,
very
general
standards.
you
know,
what
starts
to
be
enough,
and
what
isn't,
and
when
are
we
going
to
be
confident
that
when
we--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well,
for
example--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--particularly
when
the
screw
turns
out
not
to
have
been
rusted.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
but
we
do
see
examples
of
vp
factors.
the
court
of
appeals
cases
are
full
of
them.
and
this
court,
in
fact,
in
the
united
states
v.
sokolow
dealt
with
a
narcotics
stop
at
an
airport
where
there
was
a
purchase
of
an
airplane
ticket
with
cash
in
small
bills,
travel
from
a
source
state
city
for
drugs,
an
individual
who
traveled
under
an
alias,
appeared
nervous,
and
did
not
put
his
address
on
his
checked
luggage,
and
the
court
looked
back
to
florida
v.
royer,
where
it
had
confronted
a
situation
where
an
individual
had
purchased
a
ticket
with
small
bills,
traveled
from
a
source
city
for
drugs
under
an
alias--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--and--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
think
this
court
has
been
exercising
de
novo
review,
so
to
that
extent
i
think
that
the
court
should
continue
to
do
what
it's
been
doing.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
well,
in
carroll
and
in
beck
the
court
did
say
that
independent
and
plenary
review
was
the
standard,
and
i
think
in
practice
you
see
in
analyzing
the
cases
that
the
court
has
exercised
its
own
judgment
and
not
referred
to
the
need
to
defer
to
any
district
court,
or--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it
is
different.
in
illinois
v.
gates,
the
court
said
that
there
should
be
deference
in
that
circumstance
to
the
issuing
magistrate.
now,
it's...
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
from
gates
that
the
court
of
appeals
defers
to
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
also
defers
to
the
issuing
magistrate,
and
in
that
case
that's
based
on
the
policy
favoring
warrants,
a
strong
fourth
amendment
policy
that
a
search
pursuant
to
a
warrant
is
the
preferred
form
of
privacy
intrusion,
and
so
to
that
extent,
when
you
don't
have
the
magistrate
issuing
the
warrant,
you
don't
have
that
form
of
deference.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
