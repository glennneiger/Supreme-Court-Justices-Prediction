mr.
robert
g.
lebell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
this
court
should
maintain
the
de
novo
review
standard
for
fourth
amendment
warrantless
cases
as
it
has
previously
done
in
first
amendment
cases,
fourth
amendment
cases,
fifth
amendment
cases,
and
sixth
amendment
cases.
we
believe
that
the
recently
enunciated
decision
in
keohane
is
instructive
in
how
the
principle
is
evolved
in
determining
that
de
novo
review
is
appropriate
in
warrantless
fourth
amendment
cases.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
no,
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
that
that
is
historical
fact,
and
that
an
historical
fact
determined
below
is
to
be
given
deference.
what
we
take
issue
with
is
the
determination,
legal
determination
whether
the
law
was
correctly
applied,
and
that
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
we
believe
should
be
accorded
de
novo
review.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
we
believe
that
there
are
three
sound
reasons
why
de
novo
review
should
be
accorded
warrantless
fourth
amendment
cases.
first
of
all,
historically
this
court
has
given
de
novo
review
for
constitutionally
enshrouded
issues.
secondly,
de
novo
review
furthers
the
appellate
directive
of
developing
the
law,
making
consistency
in
the
law,
and
basically
in
error-correcting,
and
thirdly,
we
believe
that
the
decision,
or,
strike
that,
the
de
novo
review
standard
is
consistent
with
the
principles
enunciated
in
gates
v.
illinois.
this
court
has
in
the
past
addressed
issues
that
are
encapsulated
in
the
fifth
amendment,
and
basically
it
has
determined
that
de
novo
review
is
appropriate.
in
the
keohane
decision,
this
court
basically
said,
although
the
issue
of
voluntary...
strike
that,
of
custody
is
fact-laden,
in
other
words,
the
issue
is
a
question
of
what
facts
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
custody,
still
we
believe
that
the
question
of
whether,
in
fact,
the
person
was
in
custody
for
the
purposes
of
miranda
requires
de
novo
review.
that
was
federal
habeas,
though,
under
a
statute,
wasn't
it?
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
that
is
correct.
it
was
a
question
of
whether
there
was
a
presumption
of
correctness
under
2254(d),
but
still
the
court--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--that
is
correct.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
differentiation
between
a
habeas
action
or
a
direct
appeal
should
in
any
way
prevent
this
court
from
according
de
novo
review
or
plenary
review
in
fourth
amendment
warrantless
cases.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
i
believe
i'm
looking
at
the
words
that
were
enunciated
in
that
decision.
those
cases,
that
case
was
also
backed
up
in
this
court's
decision
in
ker,
this
court's
decision
in
beck,
carroll,
and
brineger,
all
of
those--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--certainly.
those
fourth
amendment
cases
that
have
been
previously
been
decided
basically,
whether
the
court
actually
spoke
the
words
de
novo,
it
certainly
conducted
an
independent
review.
in
the
ker
case,
in
fact,
the
court
said
that
when
it
is
to
be...
it's
considering
a
constitutionally
enshrouded
issue,
and
specifically
fourth
amendment,
it's
going
to
be
an
independent
review,
and
the
importance
of
that
is
to
assure
that
the
fourth
amendment
as
a
constitutional
right
is,
in
fact,
upheld.
similarly,
the
court
decided
the
same
principle
in
beck.
in
carroll
and
brineger,
again,
those
two
decisions
were
based
on
a
fundamental
reevaluation
of
the
law
and,
based
on
that
reevaluation
of
the
law,
some
of
the
cases
were
overturned,
and
some
of
them
were
affirmed.
in
the
cortez
case,
which
was
a
case
decided
by
this
court,
the
lower
court
determined
that
the
decision
satisfied
the
definition
of
clearly
erroneous.
when
it
got
to
this
tribunal,
this
court
showed
no
deference
to
the
clearly
erroneous
determination
and,
in
fact,
reviewed
the
determination
de
novo.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
the
lower
court.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
no,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
upon
reviewing
the
district
court's
decision
determined
that
there
was
no
clear
error,
and
therefore
it
affirmed
the
decision,
and
this
court
then
reversed,
showing,
in
essence,
no
deference
to
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
it
is
our
position...
you're
correct
that
certainly
the
law
will
develop.
we
believe
that
the
law
can
most
effectively
develop
through
the
de
novo
review
standard.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
i
believe
it
would
look
differently.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
i
can
point
the
court
to
this
particular
case,
where
the
circuit,
or
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
specifically
said,
we
find
this
to
be
a
close
case,
but
because
we
are
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
standard,
we're
going
to
have
to
affirm,
and
that
was
in
light
of
the
fact
that
on
two
occasions
the
district
court
reversed
the
finding
of
the
magistrate
judge,
who
had
listened
to
4
days
of
testimony,
reversed
the
finding
of
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
i
do
not
believe
so--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--and
i
don't
believe
so
because
it's
my
understanding
and
my
concept
of
fourth
amendment
development
that
there's
a
waxing
and
a
waning.
there
are
some
entrenchments,
there
are
some
developments
based
on
technological
changes,
based
on
societal
changes,
and
in
order
to
allow
for
these
changes
i
think
that
each
case,
in
and
of
itself,
has
precedential
value.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
if
the
court
had,
i
assume
in
that
particular
case
looked
at
the
facts
and
determined
that
those
didn't
satisfy
probable
cause.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
that
is
correct.
however,
if
the
court
had
been...
not
had
its
hand
tied,
and
had
allowed
a
de
novo
review,
it
could
have
perhaps
addressed
other
issues,
and
it
could
have
considered
it
in
light
of
some--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--justice
scalia,
i
would
disagree
with
that
proposition,
because
i
believe
that
each
of
these
cases,
while
they
are
specific
and
of
paramount
importance
to
the
litigants,
ultimately
have
a
place
in
the
compendium
of
cases
that
result
in
changes
in
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
my
response
would
be,
i
don't
know,
because
he
was
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
i
can
speculate,
and
my
speculation
would
be
in
his
discussion
of
the
naddis,
the
use
of
naddis,
whether
naddis
was
appropriate,
whether
there
should
be
more
discussion
of
naddis,
whether
the
defendants
should
have
been
allowed
access
to
the
hard
copy
of
the
naddis,
same
thing
in
the
drug
courier
profile,
whether
under
those
circumstances,
perhaps
this
was
an
occasion
the
drug
courier
profile
should
not
have
been
applicable.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
i'm
done.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
we're
talking
about
a
situation--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
i
would
like
to
reserve
2
minutes.
i
don't
believe
that
the
district
court
in
this
position...
in
this
particular
case,
nor
in
any
other
case,
is
better
suited
to
decide--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--i
can
answer
the
question.
i
don't
believe
that
the
district
court
in
this
case,
or
in
any
other
case,
is
better
suited
to
make
an
application
of
the
fundamental
legal
principles
to
the
facts.
in
fact,
salve
regina,
decided
by
this
court,
is
instructive
in
that
respect,
in
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are
better
situated
because
of
their
fundamental
acts,
because
of
their
institutional
values,
that
they
can
pause,
they
can
reflect
and
spend
the
time,
once
the
facts
have
been
developed
below,
to
address
the
legal
concepts
and
develop
those
legal
concepts.
so
i
don't
believe
that
deference
of
the
legal
decision
could
be
accorded
the
district
courts,
especially
in
this
particular
case,
where
the
district
court
basically,
without
hearing
a
single
witness,
and
on
the
first
occasion
with
only
hearing
one
transcript
which
emanated
out
of
4
days
of
testimony,
reversed
the
decision,
which
was
a
well-reasoned
decision
by
the
magistrate.
i
realize
that
under
the
magistrate
act
that
the
court
was
entitled
to
do
that,
but
i
think
it
was
inappropriate.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
yes,
it
is.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
well--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--i
think
that
when
you
talk
about
a
de
novo
review
that's
allowed
under
the
magistrate
act,
i
think
it
is
assumed
that
there's
going
to
be
full
compliance,
and
clearly,
the
first
time
round,
when
judge
randa
reviewed
the
appeal
by
the
petitioners,
there
was
not
a
de
novo
review
as
it
was
contemplated
by
the
magistrate
act.
i
would
reserve
my
last
few
minutes.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
it
was
suggested
by
justice
souter
that
in
the
past
the
practice
has
been
by
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
basically
it's
an
ad
hoc
basis,
and
that
the
determination
whether
it's
going
to
be
clearly
erroneous,
or
where
it's
going
to
be
de
novo,
is
sort
of
on,
we're
going
to
call
them
as
we
see
them,
and
i
think
that's...
and
the
question
was
posed,
why
couldn't
that
just
continue
to
work.
i
don't
believe
it
could
continue
to
work.
first
of
all,
it--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--as
a
practical
matter?
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
precisely
what
has
been
going
on,
and
i
think
the
resultant
effect
is
that
there
is
no
continuity
in
decisions,
and
there's
a
disparity
in
these
decisions
and
the
application
of
fourth
amendment
principles.
more
importantly,
it
was
posed
by
counsel
that
perhaps
this
should
be
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
more
clearly
define
the
definition
of
clearly
erroneous,
as
was
announced
in
bessemer.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
more
workable
standard
by
which
to
determine
when
something
is
clearly
erroneous
or
is
not.
there's
no
way
to
quantify
by
setting
a
certain
specific
value,
and
basically
what
it
comes
down
to
is
a
court
of
appeal
judge
saying,
i
think
this
is
clearly
erroneous,
and
i
think
it's
a
totally
subjective
standard,
and
i
think
it's
unworkable
in
the
sense
of
saying
we
should
leave
it
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
counsel
also
alludes
to
the
principles
enunciated
in
gates
v.
illinois,
and
it
is
our
position
as
petitioners
that
to
accord
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
in
warrantless
fourth
amendment
cases
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
principles
of
gates.
in
gates,
obviously
the
court,
citing
ventresca,
was
trying
to
encourage
police
officers,
the
front
line
law
enforcement
individuals,
to
rely
on
the
warrant.
to
now
say
to
police
officers,
or
send
the
same
message,
well,
if
we're
going
to...
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
a
nonwarrant
situation,
basically
we're
going
to
accord
the
same
deference
to
that
decision,
i
think
it's--
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
--i
believe
that
when
the
court
based
gates
on
the
belief
that
law
enforcement
officers
were,
in
fact,
going
to
rely
on
warrants
because
they
had
been
given
deference,
i
believe
that
principle
was
appropriate,
and
i
also
conversely
believe
that
the
exact
opposite
message
is
going
to
be
disseminated
by
police
officers.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
sometimes
they
pick
the
judges
that
they
go
to
for
warrants.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
g.
lebell
thank
you.
