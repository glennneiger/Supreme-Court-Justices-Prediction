justice
stevens
mr.
isakoff,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
that
occurred
to
me
listening
to
your
opponents?
she
suggested
that
what
this
court
has,
in
fact,
done
in
cases
like
brineger
and
all
the
airport
search
cases
where
they
reversed
and
so
forth,
they
just
explained...
the
court
explained
its
conclusion
why
there
was,
in
fact,
probable
cause,
and
usually
reversed
in
most
of
those
cases
i
remember.
but
they
never
said
anything
about
a
deferential
standard.
they
just
went
ahead
and
did
it,
which
seems
to
imply
that
the
court
itself,
this
court,
has
applied
a
de
novo
standard.
