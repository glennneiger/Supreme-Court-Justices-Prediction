justice
breyer
the...
what
i
thought...
i
agreed
with
justice
kennedy,
i
thought
where
the
issue
is
one
of
elaborating
the
law,
elaborating
it,
there,
certainly
the
court
of
appeals,
apparently,
as
judge
posner
did,
feels
free
to
do
that
under
the
deferential
standard,
and
that's
certainly
appropriate.
it's
a
very
interesting
opinion
on
statistics,
and
elaborating
the
law.
we're
only
talking,
i
take
it,
where
it's
pure
application
of
a
label
to
a
set
of
facts.
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
breyer
the
application
of
a
legal
label
to
a
set
of
facts?
justice
breyer
well,
in
that
respect,
should
we
not
pay
more
attention
to
district
courts
that
deal
with
these
things
regularly,
that
understand
the
sort
of
impossible-to-set-down-in-writing
factors,
and
try
to
prevent
too
many
absolute
elaborations
by
appeals
judges,
who
know
less
about
it?
justice
breyer
if
you
want
to
go
ahead,
you
go
ahead,
because
there's
other
people
who
could
answer
that,
i
realize,
if
you
don't
want
to--
justice
breyer
you're
right,
i--
justice
breyer
--i
think
you're
right
that
if
the
seventh
were
talking
solely
about
the
application
of
a
label
to
a
set
of
facts,
if
circuit
courts
do
it
you
will
get
better
precedent.
i
agree
with
you.
that
also
has
a
down
side.
there
will
be
less
flexibility
in
the
law,
and
the
other
down
side,
which
i
don't
know
how
much
weight
to
give
it,
is
that
district
judges
would
then
feel
that
they
have
to
really
write
out
every
last
detailed
fact,
including
matters
of
mood
and
that...
very
hard
to
write
down.
what
they
do
now
very
often
is,
they
just
say,
probable
cause,
that's
it,
and
they
don't
feel
they
have
to
go
and
write
every
last
little
bit
down.
so
how
do
we
weigh
that?
on
the
one
side,
you're
right
about
it
being
more
binding
precedent.
on
the
other
side,
it's
going
to
be
quite
a
complicated
thing
in
many
cases
to
try
to
write
everything
down...
you
know,
every
last
little
detail...
because
the
three
judges
up
there
who
know
nothing
about
it
are
going
to
start
second-guessing
it.
so
that's
an
administrative...
i
mean,
i'm
sort
of...
i
don't
know
which
way.
you
see
one
thing
on
one
side,
one
on
the
other.
justice
breyer
he
says,
look,
there
is
a
screw
here,
and
there
wasn't
that
much
rust
on
it.
i
thought
it
was
rust.
it
probably
had
been
scraped,
and
besides
that,
there's
this
thing
in
the
door
that
looked
a
little
odd,
all
right,
and
so
the
judge,
trial
judge
is
sitting
there,
and
he
says,
jeez,
i
better
say
exactly
what
angle
it
was
at,
what's
the
oddness
about
it,
he
sort
of
made
a
funny
expression
when
he
said
that,
maybe
that
has...
you
see,
i'm
worried
about
complicating
the
law
an
awful
lot
when
they
try
to...
is
that
a
legitimate
concern,
or
to
what
extent--
justice
breyer
is
it...
this
is...
i
can't
work
out
how
this
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
decided
one
way
or
the
other.
that's
my
basic
problem.
i
mean,
i
take
it
that
the...
we're
all
agreed
that
any
kind
of
question
of
law
that
would
require
an
elaboration
of
the
law
as
contrasted
with
simply
applying
a
label
to
a
set
of
facts
is
for
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
breyer
--de
novo.
so
we're
only
talking
about
applying
a
label
to
the
facts.
now,
if
you
were
to
lose
on
this,
is
this
what
would
happen?
normally
the
district
judge
just
says,
the
panel
was
askew.
there
was
an
odd
light
shining
through.
the
defendant
looked
nervous.
all
right,
all
depends
on
how
nervous,
how
askew.
you
can't
really...
so
i,
as
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
get
those
findings,
and
you
say
apply
de
novo,
i
say,
okay,
i
apply
it
de
novo.
it
all
depends
on
how
askew,
so
i
assume
that
it
was
very
askew,
you
see,
because
i
defer
on
the
factual
matter,
and
then
i
affirm.
if
we
go
your
way,
i
affirm
again,
i
guess.
i
mean,
i...
what's
the
difference?
justice
breyer
in
the
one
case
you're...
because
they
don't
write
out
all
the
facts,
that's
true.
justice
breyer
what's
the
difference?
is
there
a
way
to
leave
the
law
as
we
find
it,
or
how...
what
the
chief
justice
suggested.
justice
breyer
what's
the
difference?
justice
breyer
of
course,
the
difficulty,
and
the
whole
thing
that
leads
them
to
want
the
review
is,
in
most
instances
the
judges
just
write,
he
looked
nervous.
they
don't
say
how
nervous.
the
panel
was
askew.
they
don't
say
how
much.
there
is
no
way
to
say
how
much--
justice
breyer
--in
writing,
and
then
as
long
as
that's
true,
we
defer
anyway
at
the
court
of
appeals.
whether
you
call
it
deferring
on
the
basis
that
there
could
be
different
factual
findings
on
subtleties,
or
whether
you
call
it
deferring
on
the
ground
that
we're
supposed
to
give
reasonable
weight
to
their
ultimate
finding,
who
cares?
justice
breyer
so
you
think
it's
more
honest,
in
other
words,
to
say--
justice
breyer
there's
a
lot
of
authority
in
the
agency
context,
universal
canberra,
and
so
the
question,
did
the
district
court
on
remand
hear
any
of
the
witnesses?
justice
breyer
no.
justice
breyer
so
that
would...
i
mean,
if
you
use
the
analogy,
you'd
say
look,
the
reason
that
one
wants
to
defer
to
a
district
court
in
the
legal
task
of
applying
a
legal
label
to
facts
as
given
is
that
the
district
judge
has
heard,
not
necessarily
just
credibility,
but
he
sat
there,
and
he
listened
to
the
story
unfold,
and
that
gives
him
a
degree
of
expertise
in
these
matters,
but
there's
none
here.
justice
breyer
but
as
a
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
you'd
say,
what
in
heaven's
name
does
the
district
judge
know
that
i
don't
know?
certainly
the
magistrate
may
know
quite
a
lot
that
i
don't,
but
not
the
district
judge.
