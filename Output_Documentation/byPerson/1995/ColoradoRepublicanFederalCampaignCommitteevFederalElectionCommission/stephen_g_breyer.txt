justice
breyer
can
i
ask
one
question
in
respect
to
that,
focusing
on
expenditures
for
a
person--
justice
breyer
--but
independent,
really
independent--
justice
breyer
--forgetting
what
the
law
says.
vote
for
x.
don't
vote
for
y.
he's
a
good
republican,
he's
a
good
democrat,
or...
i'm
focusing
on
that.
i
take
it...
and
i
don't
understand
the
constitutional
basis
for
the
distinction.
under
the
first
amendment,
what
would
the
theory
be?
an
individual,
if
he's
really
independent,
can
spend
as
much
as
he
wants.
justice
breyer
a
pac,
if
he's
really
independent,
can
spend
as
much
as
he
wants,
but
a
political
party,
the
function
of
which
is
to
help
democracy
by
translating
people's
wishes
into
a
government,
cannot
spend
anything.
now,
what's
the...
if
i've
stated
that
correctly,
what's
the
justification
under
the
first
amendment
for
that?
justice
breyer
right,
so
which
way
does
that
cut?
justice
breyer
but
which
way
does
that
cut?
if
you
can't
draw
the
line,
does
that
mean
everything
should
be
treated
as
if
it
were
a
contribution,
or
does
it
mean
that
everything
should
be
treated
as
if
it
were
an
expenditure?
justice
breyer
because?
