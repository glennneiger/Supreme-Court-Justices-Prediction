justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
baran,
i
thought
there
was
another
possible
question
here,
which
is
whether
the
statute
as
presently
drafted
covers
this
expenditure
at
all.
one
could...
this
was
an
advertisement,
as
i
understand
it,
paid
for
by
the
colorado
political
committee
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
republican
nominee
for
the
senate
and,
indeed,
not
officially
a
democratic
nominee,
and
one
could
read
441a(d)
as
not
covering
that
at
all.
now,
what
if
we
think
that's
the
situation?
do
we
reach
some
constitutional
issue,
or
can
we
just
say,
gee,
the
statute
doesn't
cover
it,
and
we'll
postpone
those
bigger
issues
for
an
occasion
when
it
does?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
would,
but
what
do
you
think
our
doctrines
are
on
reaching
constitutional
issues
unnecessarily?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
i
thought
you
took
the
position
here
that
this
wasn't
a
coordinated
expenditure.
it
was
at
a
time
when
there
wasn't
even
a
nominee,
and
it
was
an
independent
expression
of
viewpoint.
now,
i
understood
from
your
briefs
that
was
your
position.
have
you
given
that
up?
justice
o'connor
yes,
but--
justice
o'connor
but
i
would
think
it's
quite
diffused
if
it
flows
to
the
party
without
designation.
you're--
justice
o'connor
--it's
a
step
removed,
isn't
it,
from
anything
that
we've
upheld?
you
have
to
acknowledge
that.
justice
o'connor
yes,
now,
are
those--
justice
o'connor
--are
those
independent,
or
are
they
to
be
treated
as
coordinated?
justice
o'connor
exactly,
so
what
do
we
do
if
we
think
there
is
such
a
thing,
there
is
such
an
animal...
contrary
to
what
your
opponent
here
says
today,
suppose
we
think
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
independent
party
expenditure,
there
is
such
an
animal,
and
that
they
can't
be
constitutionally
limited,
do
we
narrow
the
construction
of
441a(d)?
what
do
we
do?
justice
o'connor
but
you've
told
us
here
today
that
you
think
there
are
some
independent
expenditures
possible
for
a
political
party,
so
that
doesn't
quite
track.
justice
o'connor
and
also,
under
this
statute
i
think
we
are
still
dealing,
are
we
not,
with
441a(d)?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
that...
we're
trying
to
interpret--
justice
o'connor
--and
then
determine,
i
gather,
it's
constitutionality--
justice
o'connor
--as
interpreted.
justice
o'connor
and
subsection
(3)
prohibits...
says
that
a
national
or
state
or
local
committee
may
not
make
any
expenditure
in
connection
with
the
general
election
campaign
of
a
candidate
for
federal
office
in
a
state
who
is
affiliated
with
such
party.
justice
o'connor
who
is
affiliated
with
such
party,
so
in
this
case
it
would
mean
it
would
have
to
be
a
candidate,
a
republican
candidate
for
a
federal
office
for
this
to
even
apply.
justice
o'connor
well--
justice
o'connor
--that
would
leave
room
for
lots
of
independent
expenditures,
in
my
view,
and
maybe
it
leaves
open
all
negative
ads--
justice
o'connor
--against
the
other
party.
conceivably
it
does,
and
do
we
normally
try
to
give
statutes
a
narrow
interpretation
to
avoid
striking
them
down
as
unconstitutional?
