justice
ginsburg
but
there's
this
difference,
is
there
not,
mr.
baran,
that
one
who
contributes
to
the
candidate
is
not
thereafter
blocked
from
also
contributing
to
the
party,
so
you
can't
just
put
them
all
in
the
same
pot.
justice
ginsburg
if
i
cede
my...
if
i
make
up
to
the
limit
my
contribution
to
the
candidate
i
can
nonetheless
make
an
independent
contribution
to
the
party
without
exceeding
the
candidate
limit.
justice
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ginsburg
but
let's
assume
we're
already
into
the
election
season,
the
candidate
has
been
nominated,
is
being
sponsored
by
the
party,
i
make
my
contribution
to
the
candidate,
i
can
make
another
contribution
to
the
party.
justice
ginsburg
yes,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
establish
the
basic
point
that
they're
not
one
and
the
same.
the
party,
you
can
contribute
to
the
party,
unrestricted,
and
to
the
candidate
and
you're
not
estopped,
because
you
have
contributed
to
the
candidate,
from
also
contributing
to
the
party.
justice
ginsburg
mr.
baran,
there's
a
basic
question
i
wonder
if
you
would
indulge,
and
that
is,
you
have
conceded,
i
think,
that
the
statute
calls
this
a
coordinated
expenditure,
and
it
ranks
it
specifically
as
a
contribution.
in
your
uneasiness
in
answering
what
this
animal
was,
are
you
suggesting
to
this
court
that
it
ought
to
rethink
the
distinction
between
contribution
and
expenditures,
or
are
you
willing
to
go
along
with
that
and
say,
even
though
it's
a
contribution,
it's
still
unconstitutional?
justice
ginsburg
general
days,
i
just...
one
part
is
cloudy
to
me
about
what
falls
within
coordinated
expenditures
that
equal
contributions.
justice
ginsburg
suppose
before
wirth
announced
his
candidacy
for
the
senate,
but
he's
in
congress,
and
the
republican
party
thinks,
well,
this
guy
may
some
day
run,
so
they
do
the
same
kind
of
advertizing.
justice
ginsburg
but
he...
not
only
isn't
there
any
republican
candidate,
wirth
himself
hasn't
declared
himself
as
in
the
ring
for
the
senate.
what
would
such
an
expenditure
be
then?
justice
ginsburg
so
what
is
the
line
at
which
this
statute
starts
to
run?
is
it
when
either
party
has
a
declared
candidate,
not
yet
nominated
but
declared?
justice
ginsburg
general
days--
--did
i...
may--
--i
think
there
are
two
things
that
seem
to
be
getting
blended
that
should
be
kept
separate.
you
are
not
questioning...
you
say
the
statute
doesn't
cover
speech
by
the
party
on
issues
unrelated
to
an
election
campaign.
justice
ginsburg
and
therefore
you
never
get...
with
respect
to
items
unrelated
to
a
campaign,
you
never
get
to
anything
about
express
advocacy
because
it's
simply
not
covered.
justice
ginsburg
so
to
get
into
the
box,
first
of
all
it
has
to
be
in
connection
with
a
campaign.
justice
ginsburg
that
answers
in
good
part
justice
souter's
question.
justice
ginsburg
--you
say
they
have
no
right
controversy
because
they've
never...
although
in
theory
they
could
certainly
not
give
the
money
to
the
national
party,
they--
justice
ginsburg
--so
it's
premature.
justice
ginsburg
yes.
your
position
is
that
(d)
as
a
whole
would
have
to
fall.
that's
what
i'm
getting
at,
yes.
justice
ginsburg
and
then
you're
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
statute.
justice
ginsburg
and
they're
under
that
tight
a
prohibition.
justice
ginsburg
which
section
defines
candidate
that
way?
justice
ginsburg
your
definition
of...
what
are
the
other
words?
in
connection
with...
is
there
a
definition
of
general
election
campaign?
