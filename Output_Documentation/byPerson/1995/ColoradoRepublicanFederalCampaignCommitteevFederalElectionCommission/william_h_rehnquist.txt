chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
95-489,
the
colorado
republican
federal
campaign
committee
v.
federal
election
commission.
mr.
baran.
is
that
correct
pronunciation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baran.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
baran,
you
can't
just
walk
in
off
the
street
and
make
a
facial
challenge
to
a
statute.
you
have
to
show
that
the
statute
affects
you
in
some
way,
certainly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
say
even
though
we
find
the
statute
wouldn't
apply
to
the
activities
that
you've
been
challenged
on
here,
nonetheless
you
can
challenge
it
facially?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
standing
to
challenge
a
statute
even
facially.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
baran.
general
days,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
there
was
no
candidate...
you
say
there
was
no
candidate
nominated,
but
the
party
chairman
was
coordinating
with
all
three
candidates.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
putative
candidates,
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so
the
republican
party
in
power
had
not
nominated
anyone,
but
several
people
were
angling,
or
seeking
the
nomination.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
the
court
narrowed
a
reading
of
the
statute
because
it
felt
that
not
for
profit
corporations
were
in
a
different
position
than
corporations
for
profit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
we
have
accounted
for
differences
in...
factual
differences
with...
either...
different
readings
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
your
eyes--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
construction
was
given
because
a
nonprofit
corporation
was
involved.
previously
it
had
appeared
that
corporations
generally
were
subject
to
this
general
rule.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
not
an...
you
know.
well,
what
about
the
case,
supposing
the
day
after
the
election
congressman
x,
a
democrat,
is
reelected
in
colorado,
and
the
republican
party
publishes
an
ad
saying,
we
didn't
work
hard
enough,
let's
get
him
in
the
next
election.
chief
justice
rehnquist
going
back
to
441a(d)(3)
that
justice
o'connor
just
asked
you
about--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it
says
a
political
party
may
not
make
an
expenditure
in
connection
with
the
general
election
campaign.
it
certainly
isn't
ineluctably
clear
that
general
election
campaign
doesn't
mean
after
both
parties
have
nominated
their
candidate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you're
dealing
with
the
first
amendment,
i
think
some
of
our
cases
say
that
even
an
agency
interpreting
the
act
has
to
go
kind
of
slowly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
you
ask
people
on
the
street
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
the
general
election
campaign
has
started,
i
think
you
would
say,
a
lot
of
people
would
say,
well,
it's
when
the
two
major
parties
have
chosen
their
candidates.
i
think
people
are
talking
of
the
presidential
campaign
now
just
in
those
terms.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
days.
mr.
baran,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baran.
the
case
is
submitted.
