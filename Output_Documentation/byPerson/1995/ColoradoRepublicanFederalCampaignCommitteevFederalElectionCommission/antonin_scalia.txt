justice
scalia
you
had
a
separate
counterclaim
asking
for
declaratory
judgment
and
making
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute
so
that
even
if
we
found
against
the
government's
claim,
against
the
republican
party,
we
would
still
have
to
adjudicate
the
disposition
that
was
made
of
your
claim
against
the
commission,
which
was
a
facial
challenge,
as
i
gather.
justice
scalia
and
your
grievance
here
is
not
just
that
you
were
punished
for
this
violation,
but
you
don't
think
you
should
be
subject
in
the
future
to
this
provision
at
all.
justice
scalia
in
this
case
you
did
not
name...
you
did
not
name
the
democratic
candidate
that
you
were
opposing
because
the
democratic
candidate
hadn't
been...
or
the
republican
candidate
that
you
were
favoring
because
the
republican
candidate
hadn't
even
been
named
yet,
isn't
that
right?
but
in
a
future
case,
you
might
want
to
go
beyond
what
you
did
in
this
case
and
actually
favor
a
particular
republican
candidate,
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
and
this
provision
would
prevent
it.
justice
scalia
even
if
you
won...
even
if
you
won
with
respect
to
the
as
applied
challenge.
justice
scalia
even
if
you
won
with
that,
you'd
still
be
subject
to
the
limitation
that
you
cannot
support
a
republican
candidate
except
within
the
limitations
of
421(d).
justice
scalia
we
reserved
this
precise
question
in
buckley,
did
we
not?
justice
scalia
so
evidently
we
did
not
deem
that,
if
it
is
considered
a
contribution,
that's
an
end
of
the
matter.
justice
scalia
not
only
not
a
political
action
committee.
why
do
you
differ
from
a
political
action
committee?
justice
scalia
so
it's
like
a
candidate
expenditure,
you're
saying.
justice
scalia
but
there's
a
limit
on
the
party.
justice
scalia
isn't
there
a
limit
on
the
amount
you
can
give
to
the
party?
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--in
exchange
for
not
being
subject
to
the
other
limit...
and
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
one
and
not
get
into
the
other
one,
right?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
there
are
other
limits
that
apply
to
pac's
which
the
government
has
tried
to
present
its
case
as
presenting
that
one--
justice
scalia
--it
sets
up
a
separate
limit
for
political
parties
which
is
different
from
the
limits
that
apply
to
pac's.
justice
scalia
and
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
one
but
not
get
into
the
other
one.
will
you
be
happy
if
we
put
you
in
with
the
pac's?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
well
then,
you
really
can't
paint
yourself
as
being
so
much
put
upon.
i
mean,
maybe
more
put
upon
than
a
political
party
ought
to
be.
you
can
say
that,
but
you
can't
really
paint
yourself
as
being
in
an
even
worse
position
than
pac's.
justice
scalia
--but
the
party's
point
here
is
that
if
you
regard
it
as
an
entirely
separate
entity
from
the
candidate,
yes,
you
can
view
it
as
a
contribution,
but
the
party
is
itself
running,
in
a
way.
the
party
engages
in
the
election,
and
viewed
at
from...
you
know,
viewed
in
that
light,
it
constitutes
an
expenditure.
to
be
sure,
it's
coordinated
with
the
candidate.
they're
sort
of
saying
the
party
and
the
candidate
are
one.
justice
scalia
how
much
can
i
buy--
justice
scalia
--how
much
can
i
buy
for
$20,000,
given
to
the
colorado
republican
party
with
no
strings
attached?
justice
scalia
what
quid
pro
quo?
we're
talking
corruption
here.
i
have
to
give
the
colorado
republican
party
$20,000...
that's
the
limit,
right,
20
thou,
and...
no,
not
20
thou,
5...
5
thou,
i'm
told.
justice
scalia
to
the
national,
okay.
i
give
5,000
to
the
colorado
party,
no
strings
attached.
they
can
give
it
to
any
candidate
at
all.
what
do
you
think
i
can
purchase
for
that?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
too
much.
justice
scalia
general
days--
--as
i
understand
the
proposal
that
justice
souter
makes,
this
would
allow
the
republican
party
of
colorado
to
spend
as
much
as
it
wanted
on
negative
ads,
right,
but--
justice
scalia
--when
you
say--
justice
scalia
--oh,
i
see--
justice
scalia
--i
thought
the
discussion
was
talking
about
an
identifiable
candidate
that
the
republican
party
is
supporting.
by
an
identifiable
candidate
you
mean,
on
either
side.
justice
scalia
even
if
you're
just
opposing
the
democrat.
justice
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
say
during
the
general
election
campaign
anyway.
it
says
in
connection
with.
justice
scalia
you
can
spend
money
before
that
campaign
begins
that's
directed
to
that
campaign
as
far
as
the
text
is
concerned.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
why
don't
we
have
to
reach
it,
even
though
it's
been
presented
in
a
separate
counterclaim?
we...
because
there's
no
standing?
justice
scalia
but
it
can't
resolve
this
case.
it
can't
resolve
this
declaratory
judgment
request
without
resolving
the
constitutional
issue.
do
we
have
the
authority
to
say
we're
not
going
to
entertain
this
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
because
we
don't
think
it's
prudent?
i
don't
think
we--
--they
specifically
allege
that
they
could
and
would
have
exceeded
the
limits
but
for
the
statute.
justice
scalia
you
think
we
should
just--
justice
scalia
--so
you
say
they
have
no
standing.
that's
your
argument,
that
they
have
no
standing
because
in
fact
there's
no
indication
that
they
had
any--
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
corruptive
potential.
if
you
mean
that
by
spending
a
lot
of
money
for
a
particular
candidate,
that
is,
making
a
lot
of
speech
on
behalf
of
that
candidate,
you're
likely
to
promote
the
ideas
that
you're
interested
in--
justice
scalia
--that's
not
corruption.
justice
scalia
you're
going
to
get
back
some
money
for
it.
you're
going
to
get
the
guy
to
do
something
that
will
line
your
pockets--
justice
scalia
--one
way
or
another.
justice
scalia
you
mean,
it
is
corruption
to
induce
a
candidate
to
support
certain
philosophical
principles
by
making
a
donation
to
them?
justice
scalia
it's
called
party
discipline.
justice
scalia
it's
called
party
discipline--
justice
scalia
--and
so
long
as
there's
no
exchange
of
money,
i
have
never
considered
it
corruption.
i've
considered
it
good
old
fashioned
democratic
politics.
justice
scalia
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
baran,
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
that's
really
troubling
me.
is
it
true
that
it
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference?
i
mean,
you
complain
in
your
brief
and
you
complain
here
you
can
only
spend
a
few
pennies
a
head,
and
the
solicitor
general
says
you
don't
want
to
spend
more
than
that
anyway.
does
this
make
any
real
difference
to
party
politics
in
the
united
states?
justice
scalia
so
your
answer
is
yes.
nothing
to
be
ashamed
about,
party
discipline.
[laughter]
your
answer
is
yes,
you
will
influence
your
candidates
to
support
republican
positions
more
than
they
otherwise
would.
justice
scalia
you're
ashamed
of
that.
[laughter]
