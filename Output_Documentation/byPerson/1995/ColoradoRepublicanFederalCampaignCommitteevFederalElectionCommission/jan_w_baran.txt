mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
colorado
republican
party,
like
any
party,
has
a
lot
to
say
about
issues
and
candidates,
but
when
it
starts
talking
about
congressional
issues
and
congressional
candidates
it
becomes
subject
to
a
federal
law
that
limits
that
type
of
core
political
speech.
from
the
inception
of
this
case,
the
colorado
republican
party
has
asked
that
this
federal
law,
section
441a(d)(3),
be
declared
unconstitutional
because
it
needlessly
prevents
our
speech,
speech
that
we
are
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
engage
in.
the
fec
has
also
accused
my
client
of
violating
this
statute
by
virtue
of
financing
a
radio
advertisement
known
as
wirth
facts
number
1.
the
fec
would
like
my
client
punished
for
this
alleged
violation.
thus,
this
case
presents
two
important
issues
to
the
court.
the
first
issue
was
alluded
to
in
this
court's
opinion
in
buckley
v.
valeo
20
years
ago.
at
issue
is,
does
the
first
amendment
permit
congress
to
limit
a
political
party's
speech,
including
speech
that
contains
express
advocacy
in
support
of
the
party's
own
candidates?
if
this
court
upholds
such
a
limit,
then
the
second
issue
is
raised,
which
is,
are
political
parties
entitled,
at
the
very
least,
to
clear
guidance
as
to
which
of
its
speech
is
subject
to
a
spending
limit
and
which
speech
is
not?
mr.
jan
w.
baran
if
the
court
reached
such
a
decision,
justice
o'connor,
it
would
still
leave
section
441a(d)
as
limiting
some
form
of
speech,
speech
by
my
client.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
believe
that
in
prior
cases
involving
restrictions
on
campaign
speech
the
court
has
addressed
specific
statutory
limitations,
including,
of
course,
most
expansively
in
the
buckley
decision,
but
it
did
so
also
in
the
ncpac
decision
in
terms
of
evaluating
a
particular
statute
under
a
declaratory
judgment
request
by
a
party
such
as
my
client.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
justice
scalia,
that
is
our
position.
we've
had
a
separate
discrete
counterclaim
that
was
part
of
our
answer.
the
discovery
that
took
place
in
the
district
court
focused
on
that
issue
as
well
as
the
other
issues.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes,
that
is--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
we
have
agreed
with
the
government
on,
that
this
limitation
as
it
was
intended,
and
certainly
as
it
is
applied
by
the
federal
election
commission,
applies
to
both
coordinated
contributions
which
are,
in
fact,
coordinated
with
the
candidate
and
also
contributions
that
may
not
factually
be
proved
to
be
coordinated.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
as
a
de
jure
matter,
yes.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well,
we
concur
with
the
congressional
judgment
that
a
de
jure
coordination
is
good
policy,
because
it
precludes
what
would
otherwise--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--as
a
matter
of
law,
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well,
we--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--well,
we
have
what
everyone
seems
to
acknowledge
is
a
unique
relationship
with
candidates.
it's
unlike
other--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--we
have
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
justice
o'connor,
that
whether...
there
was
no
inquiry
by
the
federal
election
commission
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
expenditure
was
coordinated.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
we
accept
that
proposition,
justice
souter.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
dispute
that
my
client,
the
colorado
republican
party,
wishes
to
and
indeed
does
engage
in
express
advocacy
in
support
of
its
candidates.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
believe
that
the
declaratory
judgment
procedure
has
afforded
parties...
allows
them
to
raise
a
claim
that
seeks--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--well,
we
are
a
state
committee,
as
defined
by
this
statute,
which
specifically
applies
to
state
political
parties
and
specifically
limits
our
ability
to
spend
money
for
some
defined
speech.
now,
the--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--that
was
the
claim
in
the
district
court
when
we
made
the--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
that
this
provision
would
apply
to
us
or
any
other
state
committee
that
wished
to
engage
in
covered
speech.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes.
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
it's
our
position
that
it
should
be
evaluated
in
two
ways.
one
is,
of
course,
what
is
it...
how
is
it
labeled
under
the
statute
and,
of
course,
congress
has
provided
certain
labels
which
may,
in
fact,
have--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--it
should
be
treated
for
constitutional
purposes
under
the
strict
scrutiny
that
this
court
requires,
whether--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--we
don't
believe
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
contribution
in
terms
of
a
shorthand
resolution
of
whether
or
not
this
satisfies
first
amendment--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
believe
the
answer,
justice
souter,
is
that
it's
a
coordinated
expenditure
by
virtue
of
the
predicament
or
situation
that
political
parties
in...
are
in
that
no
one
else
is
in.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well,
as
i'm
using
the
term,
it
can
be
in
two
contexts,
because
they
are
used
interchangeably.
one
is
a
reference
to
a
factual
determination
under
a
provision
of
section
441a
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
consultation
with
a
candidate
and
coordination
with
a
candidate.
at
the
same
time--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--er--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--there
were
three
nameless
candidates
which
were
referred
to
in
the
record,
and
which
are
cited
in
the
passages
of
the
government--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--yes,
justice--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--yes,
i
think--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--mm
hmm.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
don't
believe
that
the
contributions
expenditure
dichotomy
that's
articulated
in
buckley
falls
neatly
into
this
type
of
situation--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--by
virtue
of
our--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--it
can
be
viewed
in
that
light,
justice
souter.
it
does
not
result
in
a
conclusion
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
restriction.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
understand
that.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
would
say
that
it
could
be
in
the
same
context
as
a
limit
by...
on
a
candidate
which,
of
course,
was
reviewed
by
this
court
in
buckley,
and
whether
the
candidate
spends
his
or
her
own
money,
or
whether
a
candidate
does
it
in
coordination
with
his
or
her
campaign
committee
doesn't
seem
to
have
any
constitutional
significance
once
the
analysis
is
conducted
of
strict
scrutiny
regarding
what
kind
of
speech
and
what
kind
of
spending
is
affected
by
the
restriction.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
believe
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
would
be
our
position
and,
obviously,
our
hope,
justice
scalia.
the
only
analysis
of
this
provision
in
buckley
was
with
respect
to
a
fifth
amendment
equal
protection
claim.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
think
it
presents
difficulty
either
way
because
of
the
nature
of
the
party,
the
nature
of
what
is
being
limited
here,
and
it's
still...
there's
no
other
participant
in
political
debate,
or
politics,
that
is
in
our
shoes,
none.
no
corporation,
no
political
action
committee,
no
individual
contributor.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
they
do
not
nominate
candidates.
there
is
a
legal
and
substantive
distinction
between
political
parties
and
other
participants.
now,
that
distinction
doesn't
necessarily
automatically
lead
to
a
particular
constitutional
result,
but
it
is
a
difference
that
i
believe
must
be
acknowledged,
and--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
believe
the
closest
analogy
to
this
limit
is
with
respect
to
the
relationship
of
a
candidate
to
his
or
her
own
campaign,
and
the
campaign
is
the
candidate's
own
effort.
in
this
case,
in
fact,
we
are
being
portrayed
as,
i
think
one
of
the
amicis
called
us
a
joint
venturer
with
the
candidates,
which
is--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
believe
that
there...
the
candidates
are...
in
their
campaigns
have
to
raise
their
money
subject
to
contribution
limits
and
all
the
same
prohibitions.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
only
if
you
do
not
designate
or
condition
your
contribution
to
the
party,
and
there
is
a
specific
provision--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--that
says
that
you
cannot
go
to
the
party
and
say,
i
would
like
to
give
you
now
my
$5,000,
and
i
would
like
it
to
be
used
only
for
the
benefit
of
candidate
smith,
who
already
has
received
my
$1,000
contribution.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
as
a
statutory
matter,
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
this
restriction
on
contributions
of
that
sort
apply
at
all
times,
and
cannot
be
earmarked
for
the
benefit
of
any
candidate
without
counting
towards
the
contributor's
$1,000
contribution
limit.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
correct.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
there
is
a
limit...
it
was--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--yes,
there
are
limits.
they
were
imposed
on
parties
in
the
1976
amendments.
there
is
a
$5,000
annual
limit
on
any
individual
or
political
committee
contribution
to
my
client,
the
state
party.
there
is
a
category
of
national
party
committees
that
have
a
higher
limit,
$20,000.
all
of
those
contributions
from
any
individual
are
further
subject
to
an
annual
$25,000
limit,
so
if,
in
the
hypothetical
case
that's
been
advanced
in
some
of
the
briefs,
an
individual
contributed
$20,000
to
a
national
party
committee,
that
individual
may
not
contribute
more
than
$5,000
additional
dollars
through
the
rest
of
the
year
for
all
political
purposes
relating
to
federal
elections.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
case,
justice
kennedy.
a
political
party
is
separately
defined.
it
has
to
meet
separate
criteria
legally.
not
only
in
the
federal
election
campaign
act,
but
under
virtually
every
state
law,
there
are
provisions
that
specify
what
a
party
is,
and
a
party
obviously
has
to
have
some
continuity,
and
it
must
have
some
demonstration
of
support.
it
must
have
nominated
candidates,
which
candidates
then
have
attracted
some
level
of
voter
support
and,
in
fact,
if
that
doesn't
happen,
the
parties
either
as
a
practical
matter
go
out
of
existence,
or
under
virtually
every
state
law,
whoever
they
nominate
do
not
automatically
qualify
for
the
ballot,
so
there
is
an
entire
statutory
body
of
law
at
both
the
federal
and
state
level
that
deals
with
parties
differently.
and
that
difference
is
accountable
for
the
fact
that,
unlike
any
other
group,
they
join
together,
they
call
themselves
something,
they
select
their
members
to
run
for
office,
and
they
present
them
to
the
public.
and
what
this
statute
does
is,
it
says,
well,
once
you
have
done
all
that,
and
you
want
to
tell
not
just
the
public
but
you
want
to
even
tell
party
members
why
they
should
support
the
candidates
you
have
nominated,
the
federal
law
says
you
can
only
do
it
up
to
a
limit,
and
thereafter
you
have
to
stop--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
precedent
that
characterizes
political
party
speech
as
the
state's
speech,
in
that
we
are
actually
speaking
for
ourselves
and
our
adherents,
and
hopefully
with
the
support
of
the
candidates
who
have
agreed
to
associate
with
us
and
to
run
for
public
office.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well,
each
group
is
going
to
have
to
be
evaluated
in
terms
of
how
they
relate
to
the
compelling
government
interest
that
is
being
advanced
to
justify
what
everyone
has
to
acknowledge
is
a
restriction
on
our
speech,
and
to
that
extent,
is
the
relationship
of
a
political
party
in
terms
of
its
activities
different
than
that
of
a
pac,
is
it
different
from
that
of
a
corporation
or
a
union
or
an
individual
contributor?
and
our
position
is
that
the
answer
has
to
be
yes,
it
clearly
is
different,
and
why
is
because
their
whole
purpose
for
being
is
to
engage
in
political
activity,
to
advance
a
common
philosophy,
and
to
nominate
candidates
who
necessarily
are
part
of
the
party.
they're
party
members,
and
we
present
them.
now,
what
the
statute
then
does
is
says,
well,
unlike
even
corporations,
unlike
unions,
unlike
any
other
association
in
america,
when
it
comes
to
communicating
on
political
issues
with
your
own
members,
you
become
subject
to
this
limit
and,
in
addition,
if
you
start
communicating--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--to
the
public
you
become
subject
to
this
limit.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
well--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--well,
we
are
put
in
the--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--yes.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
obviously
not,
justice
scalia,
and
the
reason
is
that--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--i
believe
that
we
are.
in
fact,
we
would
be
better
off
if
we
called
ourselves
a
union
and
called
every
member
of
the
republican
party
a
union
member.
then
we
would
be
able
to
spend
unlimited,
undisclosed
amounts
of
money
in
our
partisan
communications
with
our
members
and
then,
in
addition,
we
could
then,
as
a
union
party,
create
a
political
action
commission...
committee
which
in
addition
can
then
raise
voluntary
donations
to
fund
those
political
activities
which
may
include
unlimited
independent
expenditures.
what
i
have
just
described
is
speech
activity
that
is
provided
to
that
element
of
unions
or
corporations
with
respect
to
their
stockholders
and
management,
but
comes
subject
to
this
limit.
nobody
else
is
in
the
predicament
where
they
have
no
alternative,
legally,
to
some
form
of
unlimited
partisan
expression,
either
with
their
core
constituency
of
members
or
with
respect
to
the
public
in
general,
as
would
be
the
case
with
independent
expenditures.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
believe
that
even
as
a
contribution
under
this
situation,
the
government
has
not
justified
this
burden,
and
it
would
have
to
be
declared
unconstitutional.
i
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i
would
like
to
clarify
hopefully
a
couple
of
statutory
issues
that
were
raised.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
any
time
the
decisionmaking
of
a
speaker
becomes
his
or
her
own
decision
as
opposed
to
the
government's
decision,
it
matters,
and
in
practical
terms
this
does
allow
the
political
parties
to
make
their
decisions
based
on
where
they
think
their
political
speech
would
be
most
effective.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
it
makes
them
more
relevant
than
they
have
been
in
the
last
couple
of--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--well,
the--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--justice
souter,
political
parties
believe
they
have
a
proper
role
in
public
debate
about
campaigns
and
about
issues,
and
about...
that's
what
party
platforms
are
about.
that's
what
nominating
candidates
are
all
about,
and
this
section
tells
the
parties
they
can
only
engage
in
that
public
debate
up
to
a
point.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
yes.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
i'm
too
sensitive
to
perhaps
the
jargon
of
some,
and
i
don't
mean
you,
justice
souter,
that,
you
know,
having
clout
is
a
pejorative
term,
and
it
does
allow
them
to
say
more
and
hopefully
to
have
more
persuasive
effect.
i
would
point
out
that
with
respect
to
this
assertion
that
this
spending
is
highly
theoretical,
the
record
is
fairly
clear
that
with
respect
to
the
1986
election
cycle
the
colorado
party
spent
$1.1
million
for
all
of
its
activities,
so
it
is
theoretically
possible,
was
then,
is
today,
to
spend
money,
if
that
were
the
party's
decision,
for
the
type
of
speech
in
excess
of
the
limits
as
provided
here.
with
respect
to
when
an
individual
is
a
candidate,
which
is
a
very
important
question
raised
by
justice
ginsburg,
i
point
out
that
the
definition
of
a
candidate
in
the
federal
election
campaign
act
is
any
individual
who
has
raised
or
spent
more
than
$5,000
in
campaign
funds.
that
means
that
every
person
across
a
street
is
a
candidate
under
the
act
almost
the
day
after
election
and,
in
fact,
congressman
wirth,
before
he
became
a
candidate
for
the
senate,
was,
prior
to
that
time,
between
1984...
the
1984
election
and
up
to
the
point
where
he
declared
his
candidacy
for
the
senate,
he
was
a
candidate
for
reelection
to
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
jan
w.
baran
that
is
section
431,
which
is
a
definitional
section
of
the
act,
your
honor,
and
there
is
a
discrete
definition
of
a
candidate.
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
our--
mr.
jan
w.
baran
--there
is
not.
