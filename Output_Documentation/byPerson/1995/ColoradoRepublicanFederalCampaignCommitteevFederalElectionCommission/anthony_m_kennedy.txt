it
does
remain
under
your
theory
that...
you
say
the
political
party
is
unique.
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question,
it's
different
from
a
pac
because
you
nominate
candidates.
suppose
four
or
five
pac's
put
up
a
candidate
in
a
primary
and
backed
that
candidate
for
the
party,
and
maybe
the
institutional
party
leaders
might
prefer
someone
else.
why
couldn't
it
be
said
that
they
are
nominating
a
candidate?
i'm
not...
i'd
like
you
to
just
explore
for
me
a
little
bit
more
this
distinction
you
make
between
the
party
on
the
one
hand
and
the
pac
on
the
other,
because
you
see,
where
your
reasoning
would
take
us,
it
could
very
well
be
that
we'd
have
to
strike
down
the
limits
on
spending
by
pac's
as
well.

kennedy
but
maybe
it
should
work
the
other
way.
if
the
party
has
all
those
attributes
of
what
we
can
loosely
call
a
state
actor,
perhaps
it
should
be
subject
to
more
restrictions,
quite
properly
so,
than
a
group
of
citizens
who
form
a
pac.
justice
kennedy
but
that's
even
more
true
of
private
groups,
organizations
that
contribute
through
pac's,
is
it
not?
