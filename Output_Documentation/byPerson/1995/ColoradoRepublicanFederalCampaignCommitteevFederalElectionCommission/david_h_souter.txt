justice
souter
for
purposes
of
the
counterclaim,
is
it
your
position
that
subsection
(d)
covers
any
expenditure
that
the
party
might
make
which
is
not
a
coordinated
expenditure?
justice
souter
well,
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
that
all
of
your
expenditures
were
coordinated.
justice
souter
yes.
well,
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
souter
no,
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
position
is
in
the
litigation
under
your
facial
challenge.
do
you
agree
with
the
government
that
any
expenditure
you
might
make
that
could
be
subject
to
subsection
(d)
is
a
coordinated
expenditure?
justice
souter
well...
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
i
go
from
there.
justice
souter
if
it's
a
matter
of--
[laughter]
if
you
agree
that
it's
a
matter
of
law,
it
is,
what's
left?
justice
souter
no,
but
this
is
the
facial
challenge.
it
doesn't
matter.
for
purposes
of
your
facial
challenge
under
(d),
do
you
take
the
position
that
every
expenditure
is
a...
every
expenditure
that
you
might
make,
subject...
that
could
be
subject
to
that
as
a
matter
of
law
is
a
coordinated
expenditure?
justice
souter
but
even
if
you
made
the
expenditure
that
justice
scalia
referred
to,
you
still
take
the
position
that
it
may
be
treated,
as
the
government
says,
as
a
coordinated
expenditure.
justice
souter
does
it
follow
from
that...
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
understanding
the
terms
that
everybody
uses,
so
forgive
a
question
that
maybe
i
shouldn't
have
to
ask,
but
does
it
follow
from
your
position
that
if
everything
that
you
might
expend
should
be
treated
as
a
coordinated
expenditure,
that
therefore
every
expenditure
you
make
should
be
treated
for
constitutional
purposes
as
a
contribution
to
someone?
justice
souter
no,
but
i
thought
we've
gotten
beyond
that.
i
thought
we've
gotten
to
the
point
of
your
saying,
any
such
expenditure
which
could
be
covered
by
(d),
about
which
we
are
complaining
in
the
facial
challenge,
is
a
coordinated
expenditure.
so
taking
that
as
the
point
from
which
the
question
starts,
does
it
follow
from
that
that
every
expenditure
in
question
here
should
be
treated
for
constitutional
purposes
as
a
contribution
to
someone?
justice
souter
well,
how
about
a
yes
or
no
answer?
should
it
be
treated
as
a
contribution
or
not?
justice
souter
then
explain
to
me
the
sense
of
coordinated
expenditure
that
you're
using,
because
i
take
it
you
are
not
using
coordinated
expenditure
to
mean
coordinated
with
a
particular
named
candidate,
because
at
the
time
in
question
here,
and
i
suppose
at
other
times,
there
won't
be
one,
so
in
what
sense
is
it
a
coordinated
expenditure?
justice
souter
no,
but
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
coordinated
expenditure.
define
the
term
as
you
are
using
it,
and
as
you
understand
the
government
is
using
it.
justice
souter
but
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case,
i
take
it.
justice
souter
there
wasn't
any
candidate.
justice
souter
well,
would
it
be
proper
in
this
case,
then,
and
hence
in
considering
the
facial
challenge,
to
consider
the
expenditure
as
being
coordinated
with
them
and
to
treat
them
as
candidates?
justice
souter
would
that
be
fair?
justice
souter
all
right.
if
that
is
fair,
then,
and
that's
the
sense
in
which
you
are
using
coordinated
expenditure--
justice
souter
--then
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
every
expenditure
that
would
be
subject
to
your
facial
challenge
is
one
which
for
constitutional
purposes
should
be
treated
as
a
contribution,
from
which
it
would
follow
that,
in
judging
the
facial
validity
of
the
statute,
we're
really
talking
about
a
statute
that
regulates
contributions
rather
than
expenditures.
maybe
there's
some
point
in
the
logic
that
i'm
going
astray,
but
i
don't
see
where
it
is.
justice
souter
well,
then
i'm--
justice
souter
--i'm
just
having
trouble
understanding
the
argument,
because
i
thought
you
had...
you
have
agreed
that
it's
a
coordinated
expenditure,
that
it's
coordinated
in
the
sense
that
it
is
to
be
attributed
at
least
to
the
three,
or
perhaps
to
the
ultimate
winner
of
the
three,
and
i
don't
see,
once
you
get
to
that
point,
why
we're
not,
for
constitutional
purposes,
talking
about
contributions,
and
hence
the
challenge
goes
to...
is
a
challenge
to
a
limit
on
contributions.
i'm
just
not
understanding
the
terms
of
the
discourse.
justice
souter
well,
it...
i'm
not
saying
what
the
conclusion
is.
justice
souter
i'm
just
saying,
what
is
the
problem
about
which
we
must
come
to
a
conclusion,
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
based
upon
the
premises
that
you
agree
to,
it
must
be
a
problem
about
contributions.
justice
souter
i
take
it
it's
your
position
that
even
if
it
is
treated
as
a
contribution,
the
limit
is
still
unconstitutional.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
give
your
case
away,
necessarily,
by
doing
that,
but
is
it
fair
to
treat
it
as
a
contribution
for
analytical
purposes
here,
based
on
your
premises?
justice
souter
a
limit
on
the
amount
you
can
give
to
the
party.
justice
souter
general
days,
isn't
your
argument
broad
enough,
though,
that
if
the
morning
after
this
senatorial
election
was
over
the
republican
party
in
colorado
started
running
advertisements
generally
favoring
republicans
and
disfavoring
democrats...
there's
not
going...
there
isn't
going
to
be
another
election
for
at
least
2
years.
justice
souter
isn't
it
your
position,
or
the
fec's
position
that
that
would
still
be
a
coordinated
expenditure?
justice
souter
then
how
do
we
draw
this
line,
because
i
mean,
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
might
be,
well,
there's
no
line
to
be
drawn,
but
if
there
is
going
to
be
one
to
be
drawn,
how
do
we
draw
it,
or
how
does
the
fec
draw
it?
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
but
this
sounds
like
the
express--
justice
souter
--this
sounds
like
the
express
advocacy
theory,
which
you
don't
want
us
to
adopt.
justice
souter
but
the
examples
you're
giving
are
examples
that
would
not
be
acts
of
express
advocacy.
you
know--
justice
souter
--get
out
the
vote.
justice
souter
but
it
would
be--
justice
souter
--wouldn't
it
be
easier,
at
least,
to
resolve
if
we
did
adopt
the
express
advocacy
limitation,
because
in
that
case,
in
the
chief
justice's
example,
you
would
be
engaging
in
express
advocacy
for
a
particular
individual
who
is
at
least
assumed
to
be
a
candidate
next
time
around,
and
so
that
would
be
an
easier
problem
to
resolve,
and--
justice
souter
--may
i
just
ask
kind
of
a
broader
question--
justice
souter
--of
which
this
is
just
an
example.
if
we
adopted
the
express
advocacy
limitation,
then
wouldn't
the
problem
that
concerns
justice
ginsburg,
justice
o'connor
and
me
disappear,
because
we
really
wouldn't
have
the
kind
of
line
drawing
problem
that
we
would
have
on
your
view
absent
the
express
advocacy
limitation.
justice
souter
general
days,
may
i
go
back...
assuming
we
reach
that
constitutional
issue,
may
i
go
back
to
the,
what
is
essentially
a
corruption
point?
let's
assume
that
(d)(3)
were
to
be
declared
unconstitutional
facially.
what
would
the
government's
position...
what
do
you
think
your
position
could
be
under
the
statute
if,
following
that,
individuals
made
$5,000
contributions
to
the
colorado
party
and
said,
we
want
this
$5,000
to
be
used
in
x's
campaign
for
the
senate,
or
y's
campaign
for
the
house?
would
the
government
have
any
objection
to
the
party's
acceding
to
those
requests?
justice
souter
well,
where
does
your
corruption
argument
go,
because
i
thought
your
strongest
corruption
argument
was
that
if
you
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional
in
effect
they
can
make
a
bypass
of
the
limitation
on
contributions
to
candidates,
and
now
you're
saying,
i
think,
no,
they
couldn't
do
that.
justice
souter
well--
justice
souter
--okay,
but
there
then
wouldn't
be...
then
where
does
the
end
run
argument
go?
doesn't
that
defeat
your
end
run
argument?
justice
souter
okay,
so
that's...
you're
not
resting
your
position
on
that--
justice
souter
--well,
the
parties
could.
the
parties
could,
right.
justice
souter
well,
but
that
is...
may
i
ask
you,
then,
one
other
question.
justice
souter
that
assumes
that
if
subsection
(3)
falls,
subsection
(1)
remains.
is
it
your
position--
justice
souter
--is
it
your
position--
justice
souter
--pardon
me?
justice
souter
that's
right,
so
if
(d)(3)
falls,
(d)(1)
falls,
too,
in
your
view.
you
can't
pick
off
(d)(3)
alone.
justice
souter
right.
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
yes.
justice
souter
but
what
is
the
problem?
justice
souter
i
mean,
you're
assuming...
you're
assuming
the
problem.
justice
scalia's
question
is,
there's
no
problem.
there's
no
problem
when
candidates
feel
sufficiently
beholden
to
a
party
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
party's
philosophy.
where
is--
justice
souter
--where
is
the
government's
interest
in
destroying
that
relationship?
justice
souter
well,
wait
a
minute.
justice
souter
how
about
other
entities?
we're
just
talking
about
parties
here.
justice
souter
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
give
the
parties
through
this
form
of
speech
an
influence
and
a
control
over
candidates
which
in
the
last
few
decades
they
have
lost.
that's
the
practical
effect,
isn't
it?
justice
souter
it
gives
them
clout.
let's...
it
gives...
it
will
give
them
clout
with
their
candidates,
won't
it?
justice
souter
isn't
that
what's
really
at
stake?
that's
why
they
want
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
speech.
you
want
to
restore
party
discipline.
