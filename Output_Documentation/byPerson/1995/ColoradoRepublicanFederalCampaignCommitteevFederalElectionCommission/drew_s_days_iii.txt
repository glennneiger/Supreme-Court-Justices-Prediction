mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wanted
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
just
clarify
the
scheme
that's
at
work
here
under
the
campaign
act.
under
the
act,
an
expenditure
is
defined
as
something
that's
extended
for
purposes
of
influencing
an
election,
and
expenditures
are
considered
coordinated
expenditures
where
a
political
party
is
concerned,
and
if
they
are
coordinated
expenditures,
then
they
are
viewed
as
contributions,
which
would
then
be
covered
by
the
contribution
limits
and
the
doctrines
that
this
court
has
announced.
the
petitioners
have
accepted
this
scheme,
and
accepted
that
their
expenditures
should
be
viewed
as
coordinated
expenditures,
so
they've
accepted
this
as
a
theoretical
matter.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
on
this
record
there's
evidence
of
actual
coordinated
expenditures.
the
party
chairman
in
this
case
admitted
that
even
though
there
wasn't
a
republican
candidate
at
the
time,
that
he
was
coordinating
with
all
three
republican
candidates,
and
certainly
the
federal
election
commission
has
held
for
some
years--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
right.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
they
were
candidates
for
the
nomination
of
the
party
to
run
for
the
senate
against
the
already
declared
democratic
candidate.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
and
the
federal
election
commission
has
pointed
out
that
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
requires
that
there
have
been
a
nominee
selected
before
this
principle
applies.
the
statute
itself
refers
to
candidates,
it
does
not
refer
to
nominees,
and
there
are
parts
of
the
statute
where
the
congress
has
used
nominee
when
it
intended
to
make
that
point.
that's
not
the
case
in
this
particular
situation.
so
we're...
in
analyzing
this
particular
situation,
faced
with
a
coordinated
expenditure
that
is
a
contribution,
it's
a
form
of
contribution,
it
strikes
us
that
the
petitioners
have
refused
to
accept,
justice
ginsburg,
the
distinction
that
this
court
has
drawn
for
many,
many
years,
since
buckley,
between
limiting
contributions
and
limiting
expenditures.
as
this
court
has
said,
there's
a
fundamental
constitutional
difference
between--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--those
two
types
of
limitations.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
understand
their
position,
but
this
court
has
held
that
if
we're
talking
about
contribution
limits,
congress
had
a
compelling
justification
for
imposing
such
limitations
in
order
to
prevent
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption.
so
the
question
is,
are
the
limitations
that
are
imposed
on
coordinated
expenditures
in
the
form
of...
or
contributions
in
the
form
of
coordinated
expenditures
by
parties
subject
to
that
same
type
of
analysis--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--or
in
the
same
compelling
applications.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
what
do
you
mean,
how
much
can
you
buy?
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
five
thousand
to
the
party,
20,000
to
the
national--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
tell
you
as
a
factual
matter,
but
i
think
the
point
is,
1)
we're
talking
about
corruption
as
defined
by
this
court.
what
this
court
said
was
that
corruption
is
a
subversion
of
the
political
process.
elected
officials
are
influenced
to
act
contrary
to
their
obligations
of
office
by
the
prospect
of
financial
gain
to
themselves
or
the
infusions
of
money
into
their
campaigns.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
do
acknowledge
that,
but
this
court
in
the
california
medical
association
case
was
confronted
with
the
same
argument,
that
the
pac
there
served
as
a
buffer,
or
a
filter,
between
contributions
by
the
medical
association
to
the
candidate,
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
nevertheless
saw
that
as
a
problem
for
preventing
evasion
of
the
limitations
on
individual
contributions.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
yes,
mr.
chief--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
that
what
this
court
was
addressing
in
the
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
was
the
question
of
now
expenditures
should
be
defined,
and
what
this
court
concluded
was,
1)
expenditures
in
the
form
of
independent
expenditures
should
be
viewed
as
covered
by
the
act
only
where
there
was
express
advocacy,
but
there
was
no
treatment
of
the
question
of
limitations
on
contributions.
what
we're
talking
about
here--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--are
limitations
on
contributions.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
certainly
correct,
but
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
party...
what
the
petitioners
are
arguing
for
here
is
an
unlimited
right
to
spend
funds
that
are
coordinated
either
in
fact
or
in
theory,
without
any
of
the
limitations
that
presently
exist
under
the
act.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
my
reading
of
that,
given
what
the
federal
election
commission
has
done
up
to
this
point,
is
that
that
would
not
be
viewed
as
covered
by
this
particular
provision.
the
fact
that
wirth
might
at
some
point
become
a
candidate
does
not
mean
that
the
party
can't
comment
on
issues
that
affect
his
discharging
of
his
responsibilities
as
a
representative
of
colorado,
or
a
district
in
colorado
in
the
united
states
house
of
representatives.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
know
whether
there's
any
precise
temporal
point,
but
one
can
imagine
an
ad
run
by
the
party
with
respect
to
tim
wirth
that
says,
we
disagree
with
tim
wirth's
position
and
by
the
way,
he's
likely
to
run
for
the
senate
and
therefore
we
want
you
to
know
about
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
inclusion,
even
though
it
might
be
out
of
the
structure
of
the
election
framework,
would
nevertheless
be
focused
on
an
election,
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that's
important
about
this
particular
ad,
wirth
facts
number
1.
it
not
only
talks
about
tim
wirth's
positions
with
respect
to
defense
and
the
balanced
budget,
it
makes
specific
reference
to
the
fact
that
he's
running
for
the
senate.
it
struck
the
commission
that
this
was
not
a
difference
in
degree,
but
a
difference
in
kind
insofar
as
the
act
was
concerned.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
it
would
not.
in
this
regard--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
commission
has
attempted
to
deal
with
this
issue,
and
we
refer
to
it
on,
i
believe,
page
3
of
our
brief.
there's
something
called
generic
communications--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--which
say,
vote
republican,
support
the
republican
party--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--get
our
candidates
in.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
they're
viewed
as
expenditures
but
they're
not
coordinated,
because
there's
no
one
to
be
coordinated
with.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
the
act
already
recognizes
that
there
are
matters
that
can
be
addressed
by
the
party
that
are
not
regarded
as
coordinated
expenditures,
money
for
get
out
the
vote
slate
cards,
ballots,
and
things
of
that
kind,
which
the
act
does
not
even
regard
as
contributions
or
expenditures--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--so
the
parties
are
able
to
do
that.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no.
we
don't
think
the
express
advocacy
standard
is
the
correct
one,
because
express
advocacy--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think...
well,
that's
a
very
difficult
one
to
resolve,
but
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
situation
where
it
was
so
distant
from
the
electoral
cycle
that
that
might
not
fall
within
the
limits.
i
think
the
mention
of
the
election--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
mention
of
the
election
would
push
it
in
terms
of
what
the
commission
has
viewed
more
on
the
side
of
being
a
coordinated
expenditure
in
connection
with
the
campaign
than
otherwise.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
might
be
clearer,
but
there
are
other
clear
rules
that
this
court
could
adopt.
it
could
say
that
any
ad
that
mentions
a
clearly
identified
candidate
with
nothing
else
about
electioneering
message,
would
certainly
be
a
coordinated
expenditure.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
negative
ads
that
would
be
talking
about--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--a
specific
candidate,
which
said
don't
vote
for
the
democratic
candidate?
that
would
not--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that
would
be
express
advocacy.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that's
right,
and
also--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
it
does,
and
it
also
is
talking
about
contributions.
this
court
has
never
adopted
the
express
advocacy
standard
with
respect
to
contributions,
but
rather
with
regard
to
expenditures.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
the
justification,
justice
breyer,
i
think
is
reality,
that
everyone
recognizes
that
it's
inconceivable
to
think
in
terms
of
a
party
making
a
truly
independent
expenditure
independent
of
the
candidate.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
it
cuts
in
terms
of
1)
justifying
the
view
that
any
expenditure
by
a
party
is
a
coordinated
expenditure--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
it
should
be
treated
as
a
contribution.
the
congress--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
the
congress
was
concerned
that
if
there
were
unlimited
amounts
of
money
used
as
contributions
to
candidates
during
the
political
process,
that
that
might
lead
to
either
actual
corruption
or
the
appearance
of
corruption.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
let
me
be
clear--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes,
we
are.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
i...
but
i
guess
i'm
not
following
you,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--as
to
how
that
operates
here.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i
think
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes,
but
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
what
the
federal
election
commission
has
done
in
interpreting
the
act
has
1)
concluded
that
any
expenditures
are
coordinated
expenditures
and
are
contributions,
and
then
what
we
have
in
4a(d)(3)
is
really
an
authorization
for
the
parties
to
spend
more
money
than
any
other
entity
can,
or
it
could
under
the
regular
provisions
of
the
act.
that
is,
in
this
case,
it
could
have
spent
$100,000,
the
republican
party,
the
petitioners,
but
decided
not
to
do
that,
so
the
contribution
limit
is
one
that
has
to
be
evaluated
using
the
principles
that
this
court
has
announced
in
buckley
and
other
cases,
and
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
congress'
limitation
on
contributions
by
political
parties
is
consistent
with
that
norm.
although
parties
and
candidates
may
share
some
agreement,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
if,
as
the
petitioners
want,
there
would
be
unlimited
contributions
made
by
the
party,
that
that
might
not
stimulate
corruption,
or
at
least
the
appearance
of
corruption.
and
secondly,
if
this
were
an
open
spigot,
so
to
speak,
there
might
be
room
for
evasion
of
the
individual
limits,
as
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
buckley,
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
one
could
read
it
that
way,
but
we
come
back
to
the
role
of
the
commission
in
the
scheme,
and
the
commission
is
entrusted
by
the
act
with
the
responsibility
for
interpreting
the
act
and
enforcing
it.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
that's
certainly
the
case,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
suggests
that
the
reading
that
you
are
proposing
is
the
correct
reading.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
think
the
reality
that
the
congress
was
looking
at
and
that
the
commission
has
viewed
suggests
that
there
should
be
a
larger
room
for
the
applicability
of
441a(d)(3).
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
and
also,
when
it
says--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
and
i
mentioned
the
point
that
it
mentions
candidates,
not
nominees.
i
wanted
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
point
that
was
made
about
whether
this
court
has
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
it
strikes
us
that
what
the
petitioners
are
presenting
if,
indeed,
they
win
on
the
view
that
4a(d)(3),
441a(d)(3)
should
not
apply
is
highly
theoretical.
this
is
a
political
party
committee
that
has
never
shown
an
inclination
to
spend
as
much
money
as
the
statute
allows.
indeed,
it's
turned
back
the
money
on
each
instance
in
which
it's
given
that
money,
so
it
strikes
us
that
the
court
would
not
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue,
and
as
was
suggested
by
you,
justice
o'connor,
wait
for
another
day
to
resolve
this
larger
issue
of
its
constitutionality.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
it
has
to
do
with,
among
other
things,
the
prudential
determinations
by
this
court
that
it
should
not
reach
a
constitutional
issue
if
it
can
resolve
the
case
on
something
short
of
a
constitutional--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i
think
that
we
have
volunteers
all
over
the
place,
justice
stevens,
who
might
in
some
future
set
of
circumstances
want
to
do
something
that
the
law
does
not
allow.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
it
can
be
either
standing,
or
it
can
be
the
fact
that
they
may
have
standing
in
some
minimal
sense,
but
that
prudential
reasons
would
justify
the
court's
not
resolving
this
because
they
are
free
of
whatever
coercive
forces--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
right.
they're
volunteer--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--absolutely.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
i
think
that
we
would
then
turn
to
441a(a),
which
is
the
basic
statutory
provision
with
respect
to
contributions
and
therefore,
even
if
441a(d)(3)
or
a(d)
were
out
of
the
picture,
we
would
nevertheless,
if
this
were
a
coordinated
contribution,
have
to
go
back
to
the
central
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no.
i
think
that
one
of
the
curious
things
about
the
position
that
petitioners
have
taken
in
this
litigation
is
that
they
viewed
441a(d)(3)
as
a
limitation,
when
in
fact
it's
an
authorization,
and
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
and
the
statute
itself,
that
is,
441a(d)--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
fact
that
congress
viewed
that
as
an
exception
to
the
otherwise--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--well,
the
end
run
argument
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
make
unlimited
contributions
to
the
candidate,
but
that
does
not
necessarily
follow.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
but
our
point
with
respect
to
the
corruption
is
that,
although
the
limits
of
individual
contributions
and
political
committee
contributions
would
remain
the
same,
it
would
be
possible
to,
if
you
will,
focus
and
target
these
amounts
of
moneys
in
a
way
that
would
not
be
possible--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--the
parties
could,
and
indeed--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that
is
in--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--441a(a).
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
441a(a)
is...
if
we're
talking
about
the
same
provision.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
that's
correct,
so--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
oh,
of
course.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
of
course.
yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
major
statute.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
but
going
to
this
question
of
corruption,
the
court
has
never
concluded,
nor
did
congress,
that
for
example,
family
members
would
be
likely
to
seek
undue
influence
with
their
own
family
members
but
nevertheless
upheld
the
limitation
on
contributions
by
family
members
to
their
own
sons
and
daughters
and
wives
and
husbands.
so
the
point
is
not
necessarily
that
there
would
be
actual
corruption,
but
the
appearance
of
corruption,
and
i
think
that
the...
what
the
statute
reflects
and
what
this
court's
decisions
reflect
is
that
there
is
a
significant
corruptive
potential
in
large
amounts
of
money.
that
is--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
no,
that
is...
that
is
not
corruption.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--not
necessarily
line
your
pockets,
line
the
pockets
of
your
campaign.
that
is,
foster
your
political
career
in
ways
that
are
contrary
to
what
otherwise
would
be
your
best
judgment.
i
think
that
is
the
teaching
of
buckley
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
it
is
not
corruption,
but
i
think
the
difference,
justice
scalia,
is
in
the
amount
of
money.
i
think
congress
in
the
campaign
act
recognized
that
political
parties
could
exert
certain
influence
on
their
candidates
and
on
their
elected
officials
and
make
them
do
a
variety
of
things.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
they
always
have,
and
they
always
will.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
well,
i
think
that
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
in
buckley
this
court
rejected
the
notion
that
the
antibribery
statutes
would
be
a
way
of
dealing
with
this
particular
problem,
and
that
congress--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--could
deal
with
the
situation.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
i--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--it's
not
destroying
that
relationship.
it
stems
from
the
fact
that
with
unlimited
amounts
of
money
there
is
a
potential
for
the
parties
or
other
entities
forcing
a
candidate
to--
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
--do
things
they
would
not
otherwise
do.
mr.
drew
s.
days,
iii
yes,
but
there
are
limitations
on
contributions
that
can
be
made.
what
we're
talking
about
here,
and
what
petitioners
are
urging,
is
money
that
in
effect
goes
directly
to
the
candidate
in
unlimited
amounts
of
money,
unlimited
amounts.
