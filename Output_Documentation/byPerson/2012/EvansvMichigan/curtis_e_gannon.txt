mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
the
court
can
resolve
this
case
by
distinguishing
between
the
misconstruction
of
an
element
and
the
erroneous
addition
of
an
element
to
the
case.
but
if
the
court's
unwilling
to
draw
that
particular
distinction,
it
could
also
resolve
the
case
by
allowing
the
government
to
appeal
in
both
of
those
instances.
this
goes
to
the
question
that
justice
kagan
was
asking
near
the
end
of
my
friend's
argument.
we
don't
think
that
that
would
require
overruling
any
of
the
court's
cases.
we
think
it
would
require
narrowing
smalis
and
rumsey
to
their
facts,
and
--
but
smith
would
not
be
a
problem
in
that
context.
rumsey
is
distinct
for
the
reason
that
my
friend
suggested.
it
was
actually
a
case
involving
factfindings
by
the
judge.
the
court
characterized
it
as
a
special
verdict
made
by
the
sole
decisionmaker
there.
it
was
not
an
instance
like
this,
where
the
judge
had
taken
the
case
away
as
a
matter
of
law
from
the
jury
because
there
wouldn't
be
any
sufficient
evidence.
it
has
been
cited
later
on
in
this
cases,
in
particular
in
smalis,
as
being
about
something
like
a
sufficiency
decision,
but
on
its
facts,
that
is
not
what
it
was.
smith
is
about
a
completely
separate
question
because
there
is
no
dispute
there
about
the
appropriate
construction
of
the
element.
the
firearms
offense
there,
the
element
in
question
was
whether
the
barrel
length
was
less
than
13
inches.
there
was
a
question
about
whether
certain
evidence
that
the
firearm
in
question
was
a
pistol
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
that
burden,
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
what
the
--
what
the
element
was.
it
was
13
inches
or
less.
and
so
it
wasn't
about
misconstruing
the
element.
smalis
is
probably
the
hardest
case
in
this
context,
but
if
you
look
at
what
actually
happened
in
smalis
and
what
was
at
issue
in
the
demurrer
there,
the
decision
that
the
court
was
reviewing
was
one
that
was
principally
about
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
of
causation
which
was
an
undisputed
element
of
each
of
the
counts
at
issue
there,
and
only
in
footnote
7
of
the
court's
opinion
did
it
address
potential
misconstruction
of
the
element.
and
it
was
a
different
element.
this
was
what
my
--
my
friend
mr.
moran
mentioned--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
we
--
we
normally
expect
judges
to
give
reasons
for
their
decisions.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
in
the
state
of
michigan,
the
rule
does
not
permit
the
judge
to
reserve
the
ruling
on
this
motion.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
so,
and
actually,
in
the
vast
majority
of
states--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that's
the
rule.
the
federal
rule
was
only
changed
in
1994
to
allow
this
type
of--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--decision
to
be
reserved
after
trial.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
in
fact,
in
the
federal
context--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
rule
in
michigan,
and
in
the
federal
rule
29,
does
require
the
judge
to
make
a
determination
of
--
to
satisfy
that
--
that
there's
an
acquittal,
which
would
mean
that
there
is
no
--
no
sufficient
evidence
to
--
to
support
a
guilty--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--many
--
many
states--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--my
--
my
understanding
is
that
most
states
do
not
permit
that.
the
federal
government
only
started
permitting
that
in
1994,
and
even
the
last
time
the
justice
department
studied
this
about
ten
years
ago,
it
concluded
that,
notwithstanding
the
1994
rule
amendment
in
the
federal
rules,
which
came
with
advisory
committee
notes
strongly
encouraging
judges
to
reserve
these
sorts
of
decisions
precisely
to
preserve
the
public's
interest.
so
notwithstanding--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--notwithstanding
that,
in
approximately
70
percent
of
the
cases
in
which
there
are
rule
29
verdicts,
they
are
done
midtrial,
even
in
the
federal
system,
at
least
in
the
early
2000s
is
the
only
data
collection
that
i'm
aware
of.
and
so
this
--
this
still
is
a
problem.
i
think
that
if
--
if
it
looks
like
the
decision
is
based
on
classic
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
there
is
no
argument
about
whether
it
was
--
it's
based
on
a
misconstruction
or
an
erroneous
addition
of
the
elements,
then
we
--
we
would
have
to
be
--
we
would
lose,
unless
the
court's
willing
to
overturn
the
broader
line
of
cases
in
martin
linens,
sanabria,
scott,
and
the
other
cases
that
were--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
don't
think
that
they
--
they
have
mostly
thought
that,
but
the
federal
government
certainly
has
maintained
that
that
--
that
that
is
appropriate,
and
we
think
that
in
the
maker
decision
in
the
third
circuit
in
1984
recognized
this.
we
do
think
that
there
is
--
my
--
my
friend
mr.
moran
asks
the
court
to
conclude
that
any
decision
like
this
that
is
predicated
upon
a
supposed
erroneous
addition
of
an
element
could
easily
be
recharacterized
as
a
misconstruction
of
another
element.
and
i
think
that
--
that
while
at
some
formal
level
that
--
that
that
might
be
theoretically
true,
in
an
egregious
case
like
this,
there
is
a
distinction,
which
is
that
if
--
if
this
were
an
element
of
the
offense
that
needed
to
be
charged
in
the
indictment,
at
least
in
the
federal
system,
then
the
failure
to
have
alleged
that
the
structure
here
was
a
non-dwelling
would
have
made
the
indictment
invalid,
and
the
defendant
would
have
been
able
to
make
exactly
the
same
legal
argument
he
made
to
the
judge
here,
which
is
to
say
that
the
prosecution
has
failed
to
prove
--
has
failed
even
to
allege
one
of
the
necessary
elements
of
the
offense,
which
is
that
this
structure
is
not
a
dwelling.
we
knew
that
that
particular--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
in
the
sense
that
most
--
most
of
the
cases
that
we
are
talking
about
don't
involve
this
type
of
error.
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
rumsey,
smalis,
and
smith,
even
the
petitioner
doesn't
characterize
this
case
as
involving
additional
elements.
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
lee
that
when
the
error
is
one
that
kept
the
indictment
from
being
valid
because
it
failed
to
charge
a
relevant
element,
and
the
judge
did
not
rule
on
that
until
after
jeopardy
had
attached,
the
government
was
still
entitled
to
appeal
that
decision,
and
if
it
were
erroneous
--
the
government's
only
going
to
get
a
chance
at
retrial
if
the
judge's
decision
was
legally
erroneous,
then,
therefore,
it
demonstrates
that
there
was
no
so-called
acquittal
on
the
--
on
the
offense
charged--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
only
data
that
i
have
seen
about
this
is
data
that
the
justice
department
collected
about
ten
years
ago.
it
was
from
the
early
2000s.
and
the
conclusion
there
was
that
there
were
approximately
73
pretrial
rule
29
dismissals
per
year--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--which
actually
is
a
larger
number
than
you
--
than
you
might
at
first
think,
because
that
represents
about
10
percent
of
the
number
of
cases
that
were
actually
resolved
by
jury
verdicts.
and
so
it
--
it
is
not
uncommon.
i
mean,
this
particular
type
of
error
that
we
have
in
this
case
we
think
is
the
most
egregious
kind,
the
non-existent
element
error,
which
the
government
had
also
pointed
out
in
its
amicus
brief
in
smalis,
we
think
is
the
most
egregious
kind
of
error.
it's
one
that
demonstrates
that
the
court
is
engaging
in
--
it's
usurping
the
province
of
the
legislature
in
redefining
the
scope
of
the
offense.
and
we
think,
under
the
terms
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
itself,
which
talks
about
whether
there's
been
--
somebody's
been
subject
to
being
twice
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense
--
then
it
--
it
matters
what
the
offense
was.
and
when
the
judge
has
redefined
the
--
the
crime
so
extensively
that
the
indictment
literally
would
have
been
invalid
and
could
have
been
dismissed
as
not
adequately
alleging
the
elements
of
the
offense,
and
we
know
that
that
is
something
the
government
would
have
been
able
to
appeal.
we
also
know
that
the
government
would
be
able
to
appeal
if
the
judge
had
reserved
decision
until
after
the
jury
had
returned
a
jury
--
a
guilty
verdict.
we
acknowledge,
as
the
state
does,
that
jury
verdicts
are
different.
if
a
jury
is
mis-instructed
and
a
jury
returns
an
acquittal,
that
we
are
not
quarrelling
with
that
in
any
way;
we
don't
think
there's
any
purchase
in
the
court's
case
law
to
do
that.
and
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
is
because
the
jury
verdict
might
be
attributable
not
just
to
mistake
or
error,
but
also
to
lenity
or
compromise.
there
--
there
are
lots
of
reasons
why
we
don't
exactly
know
why
a
jury
did
what
it
did,
and
why
juries
generally
enter
general
verdicts.
and
that
makes
it
different
from
what
we
have
here.
we
have
here
an
instance
where
the
court,
as
a
matter
of
law,
at
the
defendant's
behest,
took
the
case
away
from
the
jury.
we
think
the
fact
that
the
defendants
chose--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
do
think
that
that's
important
by
analogy
to
the
court's
mistrial
cases
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
context.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
or
if
the
defendant
consents
to
it,
as
is
the
case
in
the
mistrial
cases
in
the
double
jeopardy
context.
