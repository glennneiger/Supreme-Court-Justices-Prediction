justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
the
problem,
but
i
am
still
back
to
where
justice
kennedy
was,
and
that
is
my
own
failure.
i
didn't
quite
understand.
i
thought
when
you
grant
a
dismissal,
and
you
dismiss
the
case
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
because
the
prosecution
was
brought
too
late.
all
you're
doing
is,
in
the
middle
of
the
trial,
granting
something
that
you
should
have
granted
in
the
first
place
before
you
impaneled
the
jury.
but
i
thought
in
fong
foo,
judge
wyzanski
had
dismissed
the
case
after
empanelment
because
he
wrongly
thought
that
the
u.s.
attorney
had
been
talking
to
a
witness
or
a
juror
or
something
at
lunch
time.
and
that
he
had
--
and
that's
an
acquittal.
and
i
thought
justice
harlan
for
the
court
wrote
double
jeopardy.
jeopardy
attached,
you
can't
try
him
again.
and
i
didn't
think
the
court
ever
overruled
that.
that
--
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
scott
says
that
even
in
judge
--
scott
says
fong
foo
was
wrong,
that
that
--
because
the
reason
that
charlie
wyzanski
dismissed
it
is
he
has
this
idea
of
a
--
the
ausa
doing
something
improper
at
lunch.
and
--
and
that's
--
that's
--
now
on
your
theory,
on
the
theory
you
just
enunciated,
there
would
--
there
would
--
double
jeopardy
wouldn't
protect
against
the
second
indictment,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
--
now,
i
take
it
you
--
you
--
you
agree
that
sometimes
the
prosecution
--
i'm
not
saying
anyone
would
--
but
they
--
the
defendant's
acquitted
by
the
jury
so
--
because
he
doesn't
find
--
they
don't
find
enough
evidence
and
so
the
prosecutor
thinks,
"i
think
i'd
like
to
try
him
again.
"
and
then
he's
acquitted
again.
"i'd
like
to
try
him
again.
"
and
he's
acquitted
again.
now,
substitute
judge
for
jury,
the
same
thing
could
happen.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
why
not.
and
there's
no
answer
to
that,
is
there?
and
if
there's
no
answer
to
that,
the
same
bad
thing
could
happen.
well,
then
you're
going
to
have
to
start
distinguishing
among
which
judge
or
jury
acquittals
do
or
do
not
invoke
the
problem
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
where
i'm
driving
is
that
--
that
there
is
a
principle
and
the
principle
was
--
seems
the
simplest
way
to
put
it
is
where
in
fact
the
acquittal
rests
upon
a
judgment
that
there
isn't
enough
evidence,
that's
it,
that's
what
we're
after.
and
where
it's
some
procedural
thing
or
not,
maybe
we
aren't.
okay.
now,
the
virtue
of
that
is
it's
simple,
it's
consistent
with
the
cases,
it's
been
clear.
and
you're
advocating
let's
go
into
that
and
change
it
or
at
least
interpret
the
cases
that's
consistent
with
it.
and
we're
saying
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
is
because
the
judge
had
in
mind
a
legal
point
that
he
was
wrong
about,
then
double
jeopardy
clause
doesn't
work.
but
if
the
judge
was
right,
it
does
work.
well,
except
for
the
matter
of
substantive
evidence.
now,
that
waste
is
your
opponent
lies
a
mess.
i
just
went
through
that
long
thing,
because
i
don't
want
you
to
get
--
sit
down
without
addressing
what
i
see
as
a
central
problem,
namely,
if
we
don't
accept
his
view,
it's
going
to
be
a
terrible
mess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you're
beginning
to
make
distinctions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
once
you
make
those
distinctions,
i
go
back
to
the
question
i
asked,
which
was
there
is
a
distinction.
the
distinction
is
whether
it's
a
procedural
ground
or
--
and
justice
harlan's
--
it's
whether
there
was
--
"just
talk
to
the
u.s.
attorney,
i
didn't
like
it.
"
or
“
talk
to
the
witness
”
or
“
the
prosecution
brought
too
late
”.
the
other
side
of
it
where
the
clause
attaches
is
where
it
was
done
on
a
substantive
basis,
not
enough
evidence.
i
said
--
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself,
but
i'm
saying
what
he's
coming
up
with
is
a
simple,
clear
rule
basically
consistent
with
the
cases
and
why
shouldn't
we
follow
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
go
through
this.
my
basic
question:
normally,
a
judge
will
wait
till
the
jury
comes
in
and
then
decide,
if
the
jury
convicts
him,
whether
to
set
it
aside.
so
there's
no
problem.
so
now
we
have
the
judge
--
for
one
reason
or
other,
this
judge
has
decided
to
grant
the
motion
of
acquittal
in
the
middle
of
the
case.
now,
this
is
unusual,
i
think
--
i
hope.
and
if
so,
though,
the
judge
might
not
think
of
writing
down
his
reasons.
so
he
might
just
say
there
isn't
enough
evidence.
and
now
it
happens
that,
just
before
he
did
that,
the
defense
lawyer
argued
to
him
an
erroneous
theory.
all
right.
an
added
element
or
something
or
other.
some
kind
of
misconstruction
of
this.
what
happens
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
this
a
judge,
after
all,
who
for
some
reason
--
we
don't
know
what
--
decided
instead
of
waiting,
as
they
normally
would
do,
grant
it
in
the
middle
of
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
think
there
are
a
lot
more
places--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
do.
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
then
this
is
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
has
arisen
a
lot
more
than
--
than
i
think.
all
right.
fine.
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
that
case,
do
they
have
to
write
it
down?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then,
in
other
words,
when
an
acquittal--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
have
any
--
your
--
your
idea
of
what
the
empirical
situation
is
in
the
last
30
or
40
years?
have
most
u.s.
prosecutors
or
prosecutors
in
these
states
thought
that
they
could
appeal
an
acquittal
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
judge
made
a
mistake
of
law?
