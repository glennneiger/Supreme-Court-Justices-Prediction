suppose
the
question--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
hard
to
argue
with
a
notion
that
your
client
has
gotten
a
windfall
here?
i
mean,
this
is
not
continuing
government
oppression
and
--
and,
you
know,
that's
--
that
--
that
suggests
a
real
harm
on
the
part
of
your
client.
i
mean,
here's
a
cause
of
a
legal
error,
your
client
walks
away
the
winner
when
he
shouldn't
have.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
this
is
--
this
is
an
argument
against
this
whole
line
of
cases,
that
this
whole
line
of
cases
has
essentially
set
up
a
system
where
the
real
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
do
not
apply
and
where
defendants
walk
away
with
windfalls.
and
i
guess
what's
your
best
argument
against
that
proposition?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
baughman,
what
would
happen
if
the
defendant
asked
for
improper
instructions,
really
saying
exactly
something
like
this;
you
know,
that
the
jury
has
to
find
this
additional
element
that
in
fact
it
doesn't
have
to
find?
but
your
theory,
i
would
think,
would
say
that
too,
the
government
could
try
the
defendant
again.
after
all,
the
government
didn't
get
its
one
fair
shot.
justice
elena
kagan
you
don't
go
that
far,
in
other
words,
just
because
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
this
case,
but
do
you
concede
that
the
logic
of
your
position
would
extend
to
improperly
instructed
juries?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
we've
historically
said
it
in
this
context,
too.
i
mean,
the
cases
that
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
go
back
50
years.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
point
i
was
making
was
that
the
same
windfall
is
received
by
the
defendant
that
gets
an
acquittal
from
an
improperly
instructed
jury.
justice
elena
kagan
but
in
several
of
our
cases,
what
the
court
has
done
wrong
is
to
make
the
prosecution
prove
additional
facts
in
order
to
prove
an
element.
so
the
distinction
that
you're
drawing
is
one
between
incorrectly
making
the
prosecution
prove
additional
facts
and
incorrectly
saying
that
the
prosecution
has
to
show
an
additional
element.
and
i
guess
i
just
don't
understand
that
distinction.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
i
understand
your
test
correctly,
under
your
test,
rumsey,
smalis
and
smith
would
all
have
come
out
differently.
