justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if,
in
the
middle
of
a
trial,
a
judge
grants
a
mistrial
and
says
--
i'm
sorry,
grants
an
acquittal,
and
says,
i
think
that
prompt
prosecution
is
an
element
of
the
offense
and
there
wasn't
prompt
prosecution
here.
now,
could
there
be
a
re-prosecution
in
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
though
the
judge
says
he
thinks
that
that's
an
element
of
the
offense.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
he
saw
a
phantom
element,
and
--
and
that's
what
happened
here,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
this
--
and
the
fact
that
this
was
not
a
dwelling
wasn't
an
element
of
the
offense,
either.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
--
that's
a
problem.
but
you're
--
to
come
back
to
my
earlier
question,
your
--
what
is
your
answer?
your
answer
is
that
if
the
judge
grants
an
acquittal
based
on
the
failure
to
prove
anything
that
the
judge
thinks
the
prosecution
has
to
prove,
that's
an
acquittal.
is
that
fair?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
to
come
back
to
the
argument
we
just
heard,
so
suppose
the
judge
grants
a
mistrial
for
failure
to
prove
an
action
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
even
though
no
statute
of
limitations
defense
was
raised.
would
that
be
--
would
that
be
an
acquittal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it's
not
an
element,
it's
not
really
an
element,
but
the
judge
thinks
it's
an
element.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
judge
--
if
the
judge
simply
misinterprets
one
of
the
elements,
but
doesn't
add
a
new
element,
you
say
that
there
would
be
double
jeopardy
there,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that
going
to
be
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
suppose
the
--
a
statute
makes
it
a
crime
to
burn
down
a
dwelling,
and
the
judge
interprets
dwelling
to
mean
a
building
that
is
currently
lived
in
and,
therefore,
not
including
a
vacation
home.
and
let's
assume
that's
an
incorrect
interpretation.
now,
is
that
an
incorrect
interpretation
or
is
that
the
addition
of
a
new
element
to
the
statute,
namely,
that
it
is
a
building
in
which
people
--
that's
one
element,
and
the
other
is
people
are
currently
living
there?
