but
once
--
once
the
judge
determines,
quite
erroneously,
that
it
has
to
be
a
dwelling
--
midway
during
the
trial,
i'm
the
judge,
i
consider
this
has
to
be
a
dwelling,
is
there
any
way
i
can
make
that
point,
make
that
ruling,
without
invoking
double
jeopardy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
if
i
persist
in
that
view,
there's
nothing
the
government
can
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
could
a
state
provide
a
procedure
where,
if
a
judge
makes
a
critical
ruling
mid-trial,
that
at
the
request
of
the
opposing
counsel,
jury
proceedings
are
suspended
for
48
hours,
and
the
aggrieved
party
can
run
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
get
a
mandate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
of?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
my
hypothetical,
the
state
said
--
and
this
isn't
a
final
determination;
the
ruling
doesn't
become
final
until
you
have
48
hours
and
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
rationale
for
your
answer
to
your
own
hypothetical.
the
judge
characterizes
a
prosecutorial
--
or
a
misconduct
incident
as
a
grounds
for
acquittal;
it
really
isn't.
then
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
could
straighten
that
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
what
rationale
--
so
what's
the
general
principle
that
allows
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
this
sometimes
and
not
others?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
i
thought
--
i
thought
it
was
the
judge
just
subjectively
does
this,
but
he
doesn't
say
any
--
he
just
characterizes
it
as
an
acquittal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
any
states
done
that?
i'm
somewhat
concerned
about
telling
a
judge
that
if
a
judge's
best
judgment
says
there's
insufficient
evidence,
that
then
it
has
to
proceed
with
a
trial.
