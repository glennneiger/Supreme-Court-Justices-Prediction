even
when
the
defendant
interjected
this
issue,
and
the
defendant
urged
the
judge
to
make
this
incorrect
notion
that
you
have
to
negate
the
higher
crime
in
order
to
convict
of
the
lesser
crime.
it
was
the
defendant
that
led
the
--
the
trial
judge
into
error.
the
trial
judge
didn't
come
up
with
this
on
his
own.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
arguing
that
that
was
the
correct
charge
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
a
system
say,
if
you
have
double
jeopardy
looming
in
--
in
--
in
the
case,
then
arguments
like
the
one
that
the
defendant
made
and
the
judge
bought
have
to
be
made
pretrial,
and
if
they
are
not
made
pretrial,
they
are
waived.
i
mean,
here
the
--
the
--
the
case
was
ongoing
when
the
defendant
made
this
suggestion
as
opposed
the
system
had
built
into
it
a
requirement
that
defendants
who
would
make
this
kind
of
plea
do
it
pretrial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
cannot--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gannon,
if
we
--
if
we
adopt
your
rule,
it
--
it
can't
be
for
this
case
only.
and
i
--
i
think
this
characterization,
nonexistent
element,
or
a
court's
misconstruction
of
an
element,
i
think
in
many
cases
you
could
do
--
call
it
one
or
call
it
the
other.
so
that
--
that's
a
difficult
line
to
--
to
adopt.
