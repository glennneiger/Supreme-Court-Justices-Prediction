chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-1327,
evans
v.
michigan.
mr.
moran.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
--
one
of
the
reasons
we've
said
that
underlies
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
prevent
overbearing
conduct
by
the
government.
that's
not
an
issue
here,
is
it?
you
said
the
government
gets
one
fair
shot
at
conviction.
and
if
there
has
been
a
legal
error
below,
they
haven't
had
a
fair
shot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
business
about
the
judge
being
a
representative
of
the
state,
i'm
not
sure
how
far
that
gets
you.
the
government
is
one
of
the
adversaries
appearing
before
the
judge,
and
the
judge
is
not
supposed
to
take
the
government's
side.
so
he
is
not
really
a
part
of
the
government.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
if
they
had
been
thrown
out
of
court
because
of
a
legal
error,
that's
not
a
fair
shot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
that
--
i'm
just
saying
that
that
particular
rationale
for
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
applicable
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
looking
at
it
from
the
defendant's
perspective.
we
have
said
that
the
government
should
have
one
fair
shot
at
conviction.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
lose
because
of
an
error,
that's
not
a
fair
shot.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
no.
11-1327,
evans
versus
michigan,
justice
sotomayor
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
