justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
we
give
credence
to
how
the
judge
labels
what
the
acquittal
is?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
don't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
would
they
do
that?
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
it's
easy
when
you
have
a
jury,
because
what
happens
is
a
judge
can
decide
whether
at
the
end
of
the
prosecution's
case
he's
going
to
dismiss
for
insufficiency,
or
he
can
give
it
to
the
jury,
and
if
the
jury
renders
a
verdict,
set
it
aside.
jeopardy
attaches
only
if
the
judge
dismisses
the
case
after
the
prosecution's
judgment,
but
not
if
he
sets
aside
the
verdict,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
latter.
so
what
can
a
state
do
--
some
have
done
something
--
to
ensure
that
even
if
jeopardy
has
attached,
that
there
can
be
a
valid
reversal;
the
judge
is
wrong
on
a
legal
theory.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
give
us
an
example
of
what,
in
a
judge
trial,
a
state
could
do
to
ensure
that
a
legally
wrong
judgment
is
still
reversible.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
a
bench
trial.
what
could
it
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
there
were
in
your
briefs
some
examples
--
in
someone's
brief,
there
were
some
examples--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no,
forget
about
a
jury
trial.
let's
go
to
the
bench
trial.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
not
helping
your
argument
by
saying
there's
nothing
a
state
could
ever
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
know
something,
counselor?
you're
sinking
your
hole
deeper.
you're
not
helping
yourself
in
this
argument,
because
how
does
that
help
the
system?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
disagree.
you
mean
no
state
could
ever
say
to
a
judge,
given
--
given
--
render
a
verdict
on
the
prosecution's
theory,
and
then
set
it
aside?
if
you
think
the
theory
is
not
legally--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
keep
saying
“
mid-trial
”.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
--
what
is
not
mid-trial?
some
states
require
a
judge
to
wait.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
happens
in
those
states?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
keep
talking
not
about
jury
verdicts,
but
about
bench
trials.
i
want
to
focus
on
the
bench
trial
process.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
i'm
a
little
confused.
it
was
charged
with
the
crime
of
burning
down
a
dwelling,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
of?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
no
specific
statute
was
cited?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
one?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
dwelling
statute,
not
the
exception
to
the
dwelling.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
he
was
charged
with?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
did
the
court
dismiss
if
he
was
charged
with
burning
down
a
house?
i
thought
he
was
charged
with
burning
down
a
dwelling,
and
the
argument
was
he
should
have
been--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--charged
with
burning
down
a
house.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
only
quibble
is,
you
have
no
doubt
--
the
defense
attorney
had
no
doubt
that
he
burnt
down
a
house.
that
someone
burnt
down
a
house,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
got
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
a
sentencing
enhancement,
is
really
what
the
argument
is,
the
decision
was.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
every
--
you
can
be
charged
with
burning
down
a
dwelling
and
you
can
only
get
the
enhancement
if
they
prove
it's
a
house.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
many
states
have
a
different
rule.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
many
states
permit
the
judge
to
reserve
it
till
after
the
jury
verdict.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
gave
us
earlier
the
statistics
of
how
many
judges
grant
rule
29
motions
in
trial.
i
think
you
said
76
percent.
what's
the
gross
number
relative
to
the
number
of
actual
verdict
decisions
by
juries
or
the
judge
himself?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
out
of
what
number?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
case
concerns
the
right
of
a
criminal
defendant
not
to
be
retried
after
he
has
acquitted
of
an
offense.
petitioner
lamar
evans
was
charged
with
arson
under
a
michigan
statute
that
criminalizes
burning
a
building
or
other
real
property.
the
state's
evidence
at
trial
showed
that
the
burned
building
was
an
unoccupied
house.
when
the
state
rested
its
case,
evans
moved
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
he
pointed
the
trial
court
to
the
applicable
pattern
jury
instructions
which
stated
that
an
essential
element
of
this
offense
is,
“that
the
building
was
not
a
dwelling
house.”
that
act
is
covered
by
a
different
statute.
because
the
state
have
failed
to
prove
that
the
building
was
not
a
dwelling
house,
the
trial
court
acquitted
evans.
it
turns
out
that
the
trial
court
was
wrong.
under
michigan
law,
it
is
not
necessary
to
disprove
the
greater
offense
of
burning
a
house
in
order
to
establish
the
lesser
offense
of
burning
a
building.
so,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
also
held
that
retrying
evans
would
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
because
he
had
not
actually
been
acquitted.
the
court
reasoned
that
the
acquittal
was
not
really
an
acquittal,
because
it
was
based
on
the
states,
fairly,
had
a
proven
an
element
of
the
offense
that
was
not
actually
an
element
at
all.
the
michigan
supreme
court
affirmed.
we
now
reverse.
our
cases
have
long
established
that
there
can
be
no
retrial
following
an
acquittal,
even
if
the
acquittal
was
based
upon
an
egregiously,
erroneous
foundation.
the
reason
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects
a
defendant's
interest
in
having
his
guilt
or
innocence
decided
only
once.
thus,
we
have
held
that
an
acquittal
precludes
retrial
even
when,
for
example,
it
is
premised
on
a
mistaken
understanding
of
what
evidence
would
suffice
to
sustain
a
conviction
or
upon
a
misconstruction
of
the
statute,
defining
the
requirements
to
convict.
in
essence,
an
acquittal
is
any
ruling
that
the
prosecution's
proof
is
insufficient
to
establish
a
defendant's
criminal
liability.
that
is
what
the
trial
court
ruled
here.
as
in
our
previous
cases,
the
court's
ruling
was
based
on
an
antecedent
legal
error,
but
this
ruling
still
went
to
the
ultimate
question
of
evans'
innocence
or
guilt.
under
our
case
law,
it
was
therefore
an
acquittal
that
bars
retrial.
the
michigan
courts
distinguished
our
previous
cases
on
the
ground
that
they
involved
the
erroneous
resolution
of
an
actual
element
of
the
offense,
whereas,
here,
no
actual
element
of
the
relevant
statute
was
resolved
at
all.
we
failed
to
perceive
a
meaningful
difference.
whether
we
call
a
trial
court's
error,
the
misconstruction
of
an
element
of
the
offense
as
in
our
previous
cases
or
the
erroneous
addition
of
an
element
of
the
offense
as
we
have
here,
the
defendant
is
declared
not
guilty
because
of
the
state's
failure
to
prove
some
facts,
it
was
not
actually
required
to
prove.
in
both
cases,
the
trial
court
has
resolved
the
bottom
line
issue
of
the
defendant's
culpability
and
that
is
all
that
matters.
the
state
in
the
united
states
make
additional
arguments
in
support
of
affirmance,
which
we
reject,
for
reasons
discussed
fully
in
our
opinion.
they
also
asked
us
to
reconsider
our
past
decisions.
we
declined
to
do
so
because
our
precedent
has
not
become
so
unworkable
as
to
justify
overruling
and
the
logic
of
our
cases
still
hold.
because
evans
was
acquitted,
there
should
have
been
no
appeal
by
the
state.
the
judgment
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
is
therefore
reversed.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
