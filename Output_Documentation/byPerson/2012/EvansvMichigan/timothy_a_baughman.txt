mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
trial
here
was
ended
before
verdict
from
a
jury
on
the
motion
of
the
defendant,
opposed
vigorously
by
the
prosecution,
alleging
essentially
that
the
crime
charged
contained
an
uncharged
element
on
which
insufficient
proof
had
been
presented
for
a
rational
factfinder
to
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt;
that
uncharged
element
being
that
the
offense
be,
for
want
of
a
better
term,
of
a
--
excuse
me
--
the
structure
be
for
want
of
a
better
term,
a
non-dwelling.
we
had
--
that
had
not
been
alleged.
but
it
has
been
conceded
throughout
the
appellate
history
of
this
case,
from
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
on,
that
there
is
no
such
element
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
crime.
the
statute
that
mr.
moran
mentioned
that
refers
to
the
next
preceding
section
over
3
decades
ago
was
held
to
be
words
of
limitation;
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
prove
it's
a
dwelling
to
prove
that
other
real
property,
a
building
or
other
real
property
has
been
burned.
so
in
the
1970s
it
was
held
the
difference
between
the
two
statutes
is
the
greater
requires
proof
of
a
dwelling
or
a
habitation;
the
lesser
does
not.
the
judge
held
that
you
have
to
prove
the
negative
of
the
element
that
enhances
the
offense
in
order
to
prove
the
lesser
offense;
you
have
to
prove
it's
a
non-dwelling.
and
again,
that
has
been
conceded
to
be
error
throughout
the
entire
appellate
history
here.
and
so
the
proofs
were
adequate,
were
appropriate
here,
and
the
charging
document
was
appropriate
here;
and
the
question
becomes
on
these
facts,
does
termination
of
the
trial
by
the
judge
constitute
an
acquittal
so
that
jeopardy
should
bar
a
second
trial?
the
jeopardy
clause
is
aimed
at
prohibiting
certain
governmental
abuses
that
occurred
historically.
one
of
them
is
when
the
government
would
terminate
a
trial
that
was
not
going
well,
without
the
consent
of
the
defendant,
in
order
to
take
another
shot
at
it,
to
build
a
better
case
or
perhaps
get
a
better
factfinder;
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
that
kind
of
conduct
by
establishing
through
this
court's
cases
that
mistrials
without
the
consent
of
the
defendant
bar
retrial;
that
abhorrent
practice
is
barred
unless
a
manifest
necessity
is
shown.
and
we
have
even
extended
that
to
the
circumstance
that
if
the
judge
is
intending
to
help
the
defendant.
if
he
is
doing
something
that
he
believes
is
in
defendant's
favor,
if
defendant
has
not
consented,
then
that
valued
right
to
a
verdict
from
the
tribunal
that
he
is
before
trumps
everything.
but
if
there
is
consent,
as
there
was
in
this
case
--
the
defendant
asked
the
judge
to
terminate
the
trial
without
going
to
this
jury,
so
he
gave
up
his
valued
right
to
a
decision
by
this
tribunal
--
if
he
does
that,
then
that
--
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is,
that
is
ordinarily
outcome-determinative
the
other
way.
a
retrial
is
permissible
unless
the
government
has
achieved
the
first
harm
by
the
back
door,
that
is
by
goading
the
defendant
into
the
mistrial.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
in
terms
of
the
--
whether
or
not
a
judgment
of
acquittal
was
granted,
yes,
both
the
federal
rule
and
the
michigan
rule
provide
that
on
the
defendant's
motion
or
on
the
court's
own
motion
the
court
may
grant
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think
that
would
be
enough.
i
think
agreement
with
the
judge's
course
of
action
would
be
the
judge
--
would
be,
as
in
the
mistrial
situation,
would
be
the
defendant's--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
it
--
it
depends
on
whether
you
really
wish
to
get
a
verdict
from
this
jury
or
whether
you
risk
having
a
--
risk
--
risk
wanting
to
have
a
retrial
before
a
different
factfinder.
you
may
be
very
happy
with--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--sometimes
that
bird
in
the
hand
can
come
back
and
bite
you,
when
you
have
a
second
trial.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that
--
that's
correct.
and
that
--
that's
the
logic
of
justice
holmes'
position
in
kepner,
and
we
don't
go
that
far,
essentially
because
this
isn't
a
jury
case.
there
is
a
logic
to
that
position,
but
it
is
--
there's--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--it
would
to
a
certain
extent
but
it
is
--
it
is
cut
off
by
two
facts.
one
is
simply,
as
--
as
justice
holmes
often
said,
the
--
the
life
--
an
ounce
of
--
i'm
--
excuse
me,
an
ounce
of
logic
is
often
trumped
by
a
pound
of
history.
we
have
historically
said
that
a
verdict
by
the
factfinder,
by
the
jury,
terminates
jeopardy
and
there
is
no
inquiry
into--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
when
i
say
historically
i
mean
back
to
the
time
of
the
founding,
in
terms
of
when
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
promulgated
and
adopted
into
the
constitution.
fifty
years
is
not
back
to
when
we
were
determining
what
it
is
we
were
protecting
against
when
we
adopted
the
clause.
and
as
i
think
most
of
the
commentators
have
noted,
there
is
very
little
explanation
in
fong
foo
as
to
how
the
court
came
out
where
it
came
out,
and
there
has
been
very
little
explanation
since
as
to
how
we
got
from
the
common
law
prohibition
of
a
retrial
after
acquittal
on
the
merits
by
a
jury,
to
a
ruling
of
law
by
the
judge
that
no
jury
could
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
being
the
same
thing,
which
is
where
we
are
today.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
think
you
are
exactly
right.
it,
of
course,
is
a
new
procedure;
it
didn't
exist
at
the
time
of
the
founding.
so
our
question
then
becomes
is
this
new
procedure
sufficiently
equivalent
to
the
procedure
that
is
historically
protected,
that
it's
--
that
the
protections
that
it
is
designed
to
guard
against
are
served
when
we
bar
retrial
in
these
circumstances?
and
i
think
as
justice
kagan
has
indicated,
there
are
many
circumstances
where
what
--
what
we
are
doing
is
giving
the
defendant
a
windfall
while
serving
no
interest
that
was
protected
by
the
jeopardy
clause.
so
if
it's
to
be
an
analog,
then
we
need
to
see
does
it
really
closely
approximate
a
retrial
after
acquittal
on
the
merits
by
a
jury--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--but
--
that
is
true,
except
we
--
we
could
speculate
that's
--
that's
true,
but
we
don't
know
why
the
jury
came
back
the
way
it
did.
the
jury
may
have
acquitted
for
an
entirely
different
reason.
we
don't
know,
we
don't
have
special
verdicts
and
we
don't
have
any
mechanism
for
requiring,
so
we
treat
--
you
have
to
have
a
line
somewhere.
jeopardy
terminates
with
the
jury
verdict,
which
may
have
been
misinstructed,
but
we
don't
know
why
they
came
out
the
way
they
did.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
let
me
say
two
things.
one
is
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
the
circumstance
that
existed
at
the
common
law
that
the
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
to
protect
against
of
the
executive
simply
saying,
"after
an
acquittal
by
the
fact
finder,
let's
try
him
again,
let's
try
him
again,
let's
try
him
again.
"
something
has
to
happen
in-between
there,
and
that
is,
that
a
court
has
to
determine
--
neutral
and
detached
arbiters
have
to
determine
that
what
happened
when
the
judge
granted
the
directed
verdict
of
acquittal,
as
it's
known
in
michigan,
was
not
that
at
all.
the
judge
actually
did
something
different.
and
if
the
court
doesn't
interpose
on
the
prosecution's
request,
there
will
be
no
retrial.
so
it's
not
the
harassment
and
abusive
practice
of
simply
starting
a
new
prosecution,
we're
trying
to
get
what
happened
in
that--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
think
--
i
think
consistent
with
the
cases,
and
also
clear,
is
to
apply
martin
linen
supply
by
the
very
terms
that
it
uses,
that
is,
the
resolution
that
we're
talking
about
the
judge
making
is
moored
to
something.
it's
moored
to
the
elements
of
the
crime.
we're
talking
about
somebody
being
twice
tried
for
the
same
offense.
how
do
we
define
offense
in
the
law?
in
other
double
jeopardy
cases,
this
court
has
taken
an
elements
approach.
two
--
two
offenses
are
--
are
different
if
one
requires
proof
of
an
element,
the
other
does
not.
we
look
to
the
elements.
and
to
direct
a
jury
trial,
this
court
has
been
very
active
very
recently
in
determining
how
is
it
that
we
determine
when
somebody
has
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
some
fact
before
punishment
can
be
imposed?
we
look
to
what
are
the
elements
that
have
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
if
a
fact
is
necessary
to
--
to
--
in
order
for
punishment
to
be
imposed,
if
that
has
to
be
proven,
then
it
is
a
matter
for
jury
trial
and
it
has
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
when
this
court
said
one
or
more
of
the
factual
elements
of
the
offense
in
martin
linen
supply,
i
took
it
to
mean
--
and
i
have
always
taken
it
to
mean
--
one
or
more
of
the
factual
elements.
and
we
can
identify
what
those
are.
we
have
to
identify
them
in
every
case.
this
is
not
a
--
a
strange
process
you
have
to
instruct
on
them,
determine
what
they
are
and
use
those.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
it
can
be
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw,
but
all
tests
can
sometimes
involve
difficult
lines
to
draw.
we
used
to
have
a
no
evidence
test
for
whether
evidence
was
sufficient
and
we
--
that
was
changed
in
jackson
v.
virginia
to
whether
a
reasonable
juror
could
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
you
will
find
a
great
many
dissents
in
cases
between
appellate
judges
on
whether
or
not
this
case
itself
involved
sufficient
proof
for
a
jury
to
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
test
is
not
always
easily
--
easily
applicable.
neither
was
the
no
evidence
test.
so
there
might
be
some--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
--
i
would
define
--
i
would
draw
the
line
at
any
time
the
court
requires
the
prosecution
to
prove
a
fact
that
under
the
law
passed
by
the
legislature,
the
prosecution
never
has
to
prove
in
order
to
make
out
the
case.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
it
does
involve
a
--
a
mischaracterization
of
what
the
elements
were,
but
not
of
an
element.
the
judge
didn't
here
say,
"you
can't
prove
that
this
is
a
building
unless
it
was
a
dwelling.
"
"you
can't
prove
it
was
real
property
unless
it
was
a
dwelling.
"
the
judge
said,
"you
have
--
you
can
prove
those
things
and
it's
not
enough.
"
"you
also
have
to
prove
that
it
was
a
non-dwelling
in
this
case.
"
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
an
opportunity
for
this
court
to
draw
the
line
at
does
--
does
the
judge
require
--
has
the
judge
required
the
prosecution
to
prove
something
the
statute
doesn't
require
to
be
proven,
it's
not
one
of
the
factual
elements
of
the
offense.
or
has
the
judge
--
the
error
the
judge
can
make
under
martin
linen
supply
--
has
the
judge
simply
misassessed
the
evidence?
the
judge
has
looked
at
it
and
said,
"you
know,
i
--
i
understand
all
your
proofs,
i'm
looking
at
them,
and
they're
just
not
enough
for
a
reasonable
juror
to
find
guilt.
"
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
rumsey
is
--
is
a
difficult
case,
but
rumsey
is
a
verdict
case.
rumsey
is
not
a
directed
verdict
case.
the
judge
in
rumsey
was
the
fact
finder.
rumsey
is
your
bench
trial.
it's
--
it's
--
it's
complicated
because
it
was
a
sentencing
case,
a
death
penalty
sentencing
case
that
this
court
treats
the
hearing
the
same
as
the
trial
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
but
the
judge
was
the
fact
finder
and
that
it
was
more
like
a
misinstructed
jury.
the
judge
himself--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--a
verdict
is
a
verdict,
i
agree
with
mr.
moran.
when
the
judge
on
the
merits
returns
a
verdict,
what
the
judge
does
or
the
jury
does
in
returning
a
verdict
on
the
merits
is
very
different
than
what
the
judge
does
on
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
the
jury
weighs
credibility
and
assesses
the
weight
of
evidence,
and
the
judge
is
prohibited
from
doing
those
things,
is
supposed
to
be
by
the
law
in
making
his
decision.
his
is
the
ruling
of
law
as
gatekeeper
that
--
that
we
won't
even
reach
this
decision.
the
jury
is
expressing
its
opinion
based
on
the
evidence.
and
although
it
can
be
proven
that
they've
reached
a
result
contrary
to
reality,
they
can't
be
right
or
wrong.
legally,
their
opinion
is
their
opinion
of
those
12
collective
people
after
doing
something
the
judge
isn't
allowed
to
do.
so
the
directed
verdict
isn't,
i
don't
think,
a
perfect
analog
to
the
jury
trial.
but
the
bench
trial
issue
gets
very
complicated
because
it
is
possible
to
do
something
with
a
bench
trial
that
we
don't
do
with
jury
trials,
and
that
is
have
specific
factfinding
as
to
the
elements.
many
jurisdictions
do.
there
is,
in
fact,
a
case
--
the
lynch
case
that
mr.
moran
cited,
where,
on
rehearing
en
banc,
the
court
split
evenly
as
to
whether
or
not
the
judge's
verdict,
where
the
judge
had
actually
specifically
found
all
of
the
elements
--
crime
is
elements
a,
b,
and
c,
i
find
them;
i
don't
find
element
b,
so
i
acquit
--
the
court
split
five
to
five
on
rehearing
en
banc
and
whether
or
not
that
judge
had
really
announced
two
verdicts
and
it
could
be
reformed
--
be
reformed
to
a
conviction.
and
justice
sotomayor
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
five
who
would
have
addressed
the
question
of:
is
that
not
different?
the
form
of
the
language
doesn't
control.
has
not
the
judge
actually
entered
a
guilty
verdict
in
that
circumstance?
that's
a
very,
you
know,
kind
of
off-the-beaten-track
kind
of
a
situation.
in
a
jury
trial
where
a
judge
simply
takes
the
case
from
the
jury
on
the
motion
of
the
defendant
and
resolves
the
fact
that
the
legislature
has
not
said
that
one
needs
to
be
proven,
that
is
not
one
of
the
constituent
parts
of
the
crime,
that
is
not
something
that
need
be
proven
to
impose
punishment
under
the
law,
then
he's
done
something
very
different
than
what
the
jury
has
done.
and
to
reverse
that
and
allow
the
prosecution
to
have
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
we
believe
imposes
no
cruelty
or
oppression
upon
the
defendant.
thank
you
very
much.
