mr.
david
a.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
long
and
unbroken
line
of
this
court's
precedents
stand
for
the
principle
that
a
judge's
final
determination
that
a
defendant
is
not
guilty
is
a
final
determination
of
an
acquittal
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
even
if
that
determination
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
or
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
even
if--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no.
no.
this
court
must
determine,
whatever
its
label,
what
has
the
judge
done.
has
the
judge
made
a
determination
that
the
government
has
failed
to
prove
its
case,
as
in
martin
linen,
or
has
the
--
has
the
judge
made
a
determination
of
something
else,
as
in
scott,
for
example,
pretrial
delay.
now,
the
michigan
supreme
court--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
you
could
reserve
that
ruling
to
the
end
of
the
case.
you
could
make
a
ruling
as
to
the
jury
instructions
without
--
or
what
the
jury
instructions
are
going
to
be
without
applying
them
to
the
facts
of
the
case;
in
other
words,
without
making
a
determination
of
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
government
can
try
--
we
learned
from
smith
--
try
to
get
you
to
reconsider
that
view
before
the
defendant
puts
on
his
case.
but
once
the
defendant
--
once
the
judge
has
made
a
final
determination
that
the
defendant
is
not
guilty,
even
on
an
erroneous
view
of
the
law,
this
court
has
held
multiple
times
that
that
is
a
final
determination,
that
is
an
acquittal,
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
exactly.
once
--
once
the
government--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--if
a
state
chooses,
justice
scalia,
to
vest
acquittal
power
in
its
judges,
it
must
accept
the
double
jeopardy
consequences
of
that.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
judge
came
up
with
this,
your
honor,
on
defendant's
motion,
that's
correct,
but
it
was
actually
supported
by
the
jury
instructions
that
were
in
use.
and
actually,
it
was
supported
by
the
structure
of
the
statutes
in
question.
the
statute
in
question
under
which
mr.
evans
was
charged
explicitly
said
that
the
building
other
than
one
specified
in
the
preceding
subsection--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--no.
we're
precluded
now
from
arguing
that
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes,
justice
scalia.
and--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
and
in
sanabria,
this
court
noted
that
point
exactly,
that
all
acquittals,
whether
they're
by
the
judge
or
by
the
jury
--
or
i
should
say
almost
all
acquittals;
some
are
sua
sponte
--
almost
all
acquittals,
whether
by
judge
or
by
jury,
are
upon
invitation
of
defense
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
don't
think
the
state
could
do
that,
justice
kennedy,
because
of
smalis.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because
of
smalis.
so
that
was
essentially
the
situation
in
smalis.
you
had
a
bench
trial.
the
judge
grants
a
demurrer,
he
says
the
evidence
is
insufficient,
and
then
the
prosecution
attempted
to
run
to
the
pennsylvania
appellate
court.
and
this
court
said
it
couldn't
do
that
because
that
was
a
final
determination.
i
think--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
i
think
a
state
could
make
--
investing
acquittal
power
in
judges
could
put
limitations
on
that
acquittal
power.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
jeopardy
attaches
both
ways,
but
a
retry
--
a
reversal
is
possible
in
the
--
in
the
latter.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
the
easy--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--in
a
bench
trial,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
moran
i
think
if
--
if
in
a
bench
trial,
if
the
judge
had
the
power
to
acquit
or
convict
and
the
judge
acquits,
i
believe
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
preclude
the
state
from
coming
up
with
a
clever
mechanism
allowing
--
for
allowing
appellate
review.
the
court,
of
course
--
i
mean
the
state
could,
of
course--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--in
a
jury
trial
with
a
judge--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
don't
know
what--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
they
could
withdraw
the
power
of
judges
to
grant
acquittals
or
convictions
in
the
first
place.
in
other
words,
they
could
abolish
bench
trials,
which,
as
the
court
noted--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
here
transcends
the
state's--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--after
smith,
it's
clear
that
immediate
reconsideration
is
a
possibility.
and
if
a
state
set
up
a
system
as
in
lydon
v.
municipal
court,
where
you
have
essentially
a
magistrate
making
a
preliminary
determination,
and
then
it
goes
to
a
higher
judge
who
goes
trial
de
novo,
that,
of
course,
is
permissible.
but
if
the
judge
is
the
final
arbiter
--
in
other
words,
if
the
judge
sits
in
the
place
of
the
jury,
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
a
judge
verdict
is
equivalent
to
a
jury
verdict
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
so
yes,
courts
--
a
state
could
set
up
systems
in
which
judges
have
less
power
than
a
jury
does.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
state
that's
done
that.
i
am
aware
of
what
nevada
has
done,
which
has
said
that
judges
can't
grant
mid-trial
directed
verdicts.
and
that's
the
way
in
a
jury
trial.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
nevada.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
in
that
case
then
there
is
no
problem
because
if
the
judge
makes
a
determination
after
the
jury
verdict,
then
the
--
then
that
can
be
appealed
under
wilson.
mr.
david
a.
moran
if
--
but
if
the
judge
at
the
end
of
a
trial
renders
a
solemn,
formal,
final
verdict,
"i
find
the
defendant
not
guilty.
"
in
a
bench
trial,
i
don't
see
a
mechanism
for
--
for
the
state
to
appeal
that
determination,
consistent
with
the
double
jeopardy
guarantee,
unless
the
state
has
set
up
a
system
as
in
lydon
--
as
massachusetts
did
in
lydon.
but
short
of
that,
a
judge's
determination
is
entitled
to
the
same
respect.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
moran
because
no
part
of
my
argument
depends
upon
the
judge's
labeling.
what
the
judge
has
done
in
that
case
is
--
is
a
mid-trial
dismissal
that
he
called
an
acquittal,
but
it
was
actually
a
dismissal
for
another
purpose.
that's
exactly
what
scott
was
talking
about.
and
that
is
like
scott,
where
the
judge
may
have
characterized
what
he
had
done
as
acquitting
the
defendant,
but
he--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
pretrial
delay
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
pretrial
delay
is
another
part
of
criminal
procedure
in
this
state.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
it
is
clearly
related
to
the
offense.
and
then
scott
clarified
what
martin
linen
meant.
martin
linen
was
an
attempt
to
distinguish
between
cases
in
which
the
judge
makes
a
ruling
relating
to
guilt
or
innocence,
and
a
ruling
designed
to
serve
some
other
purpose.
the
problem
with
the
line
the
michigan
supreme
court
drew
here
is
that
it
is
completely
impossible
to
administer.
and
if
i
could
give
a
couple
of
examples,
the
lynch
case,
from
the
second
circuit,
was
an
effort
by
one
circuit
to
attempt
to
administer
--
to
follow
the
maker
line,
and
you
get
questions
that
are
completely
unanswerable
in
that
case.
is
bad
intent
simply
a
gloss
on
the
willfulness
element,
in
which
case,
all
you've
done
is
misconstrue
an
existing
element?
or
is
it,
as
the
dissent
claimed
in
lynch,
a
--
a
new
element?
and
these
are
questions
like
how
many
angels
can
dance
on
the
head
of
a
pin.
they're
simply
semantics.
it's
all
labeling.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
substance
there.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
and
--
and
i
fall
back
to
this
court's
footnote
in
scott,
that
courts
are
perfectly
capable
of
distinguishing
between
rulings
relating
to
guilt
and
innocence,
and
rulings
designed
to
serve
other
purposes.
so
if
you
have
a
devious
judge
who's
determined
to
package
a
prosecutorial
misconduct
ruling
as
an
acquittal,
i
have
no
doubt
that
an
appellate
court
would
be
able
to
--
to
smoke
that
out.
mr.
david
a.
moran
only
--
i
think
my
answer
to
that
would
depend
on
how
you
rule
in
the
prior
case,
depending
on
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
is
--
is
something
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
in
order
to
establish
guilt.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
if
it
--
if
it's
something
that
could
result
in
an
acquittal,
if
it
is
--
if
the
defendant
raising
the
statute
of
limitations
is
something
that
could
result
in
an
acquittal
--
because
i
come
to
burks,
where
burks
says
an
affirmative
insanity
defense,
the
prosecution
fails
to
disprove
that,
that
is
an
acquittal
--
when
the
appellate
court
concluded
that
there
was
failure
to
disprove
the
affirmative
insanity
defense.
that
shows
that
that
language
in
martin
linen
can't
be
taken
as
if
it
was
construing
the
terms
of
an
easement.
you
have
to
look
at
what
was
martin
linen
getting
at.
and
martin
linen
is
trying
to
identify
those
rulings
relating
to
guilt
or
innocence,
which
include
affirmative
defenses
or--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--yes.
that's
scott.
mr.
david
a.
moran
if
the
judge
has
made
a
ruling
going
to
the
defendant's
guilt
or
innocence
and
finding
that
as
in
martin,
examining
the
government's
evidence
and
finding
that
they
have
failed
to
prove
the
defendant's
guilt,
it's
final.
there
can
be
no
appeal.
but
if
the
judge
has
made
a
ruling
that
is
designed
to
serve
some
other
purpose,
so
if
the
judge
in
my
hypothetical
were
to
say--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--that's
--
that's
a
case,
actually,
quite
a
bit
like
some
of
the
cases
and
it
demonstrates
the
problem
of
--
of
the
michigan
supreme
court's
line.
so
example,
in
martin
linen,
all
the
judge
said
is,
"this
is
one
of
the
weakest
cases
i've
ever
seen.
"
presumably,
if
the
respondent
were
to
win,
they
would
be
entitled
to
appeal
a
determination
like
that
to
at
least
try
to
convince
the
appellate
court
that
the
reason
the
case
seems
so
weak
to
the
trial
judge
was
that
the
trial
judge
had
added
an
extra
element.
same
thing
in
smalis,
where
the
judge
simply
said
--
he
granted
a
demurrer
by
looking
at
the
prosecution's
case
and
saying
that
“
i
find
the
evidence
insufficient
”.
and
in
fact,
in
smalis,
the
--
pennsylvania
tried
to
argue
that
the
judge
had
actually
heightened
the
burden
for
mens
rea
for
third-degree
murder.
and
--
and
so,
you
know,
they
would
be
entitled
to
make
these
arguments.
and
so,
then
we
get
into
questions
of
in
granting
acquittals,
would
judges
have
to
explain
all
of
the
elements--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--fong
foo
has
not
been
explicitly
overruled,
but
i
think
it
has
been
limited
by
scott.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
justice
breyer,
fong
foo
actually
listed
two
reasons
why
the
trial
judge
granted
the
directed
verdict.
one
was
prosecutorial
misconduct,
the
judge
apparently
thought
that
the
prosecutor
had
been
speaking
with
a
witness.
mr.
david
a.
moran
but
the
second
one
was
the
total
lack
of
credibility
of
the
prosecution's
witnesses.
and
--
and
when
the
case
came--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
the
concurring
justice
said,
"the
second
one
is
good
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
but
i
would
make
clear
that
the
prosecutorial
misconduct
rationale
is
not.
"
that
part,
i
think
that
concurring
opinion
has
been
effectively
adopted
in
scott.
so
that
a
finding
of
prosecutorial
misconduct
on
dumping
this
case
mid
trial,
yes,
the
prosecution
gets
another
bite
at
the
apple,
assuming
that
it's
done
on
the
defendant's
motion.
mr.
david
a.
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
evans
was
hauled
into
court
by
the
state.
he
was
acquitted,
in
our
view,
by
the
judge
who
is
representative
of
the
state,
who
was
relying
on
the
standard
jury
instructions--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
i
understand
that
view,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it's
contrary
to
a
lot
of
this
court's
cases.
i
think
this
court
would
have
to
review
a
lot
of
its
cases,
most
recently
smith
and
smalis
and
martin
linen,
all
of
which
said
that
a
legal
error
affects
the
quality
of
a
judgment,
and
scott
also
specifically
said
this,
a
legal
error
affects
the
quality
of
the
judgment
but
not
it's
finality
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
i
think
it
is,
because
a
citizen
has
been
brought
into
court,
expects
to
go
through
one
trial,
and
they
are
told,
"sir,
i
am
finding
you
not
guilty.
"
and
then
to
find
out
later,
for
the
state
to
come
back
later--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--your
honor,
i
come
back
to
the
language
in
martin
linen,
which
talks
about
what
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is,
is
to
protect
defendants
against
continuing
government
oppression.
and
that
oppression
arises
from
the
anxiety
of
having
to
go
through
it
again
and
again.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
your
honor,
without
the
error,
the
trial
would
have
--
would
have
continued.
but
i
think
that
argument
respectfully
proves
too
much,
because
there
are
a
lot
of
these
cases
in
which
legal
error
was
made.
and
so,
in
rumsey
you
could
say
exactly
the
same
thing
about
mr.
rumsey.
mr.
david
a.
moran
well,
once
you
accept
the
equivalency
of
a
judicial
acquittal
to
a
jury
acquittal,
you
have
to
accept
that
both
actors
are
capable
of
error.
both
actors
are
human.
jurors
are
--
are
capable
of
making
legal
errors
as
well
as
factual
errors.
they
are
capable
of
misunderstanding
the
instructions.
in
fact,
they
are
capable
of
being
misinstructed.
had
the
judge
not
granted
the
directed
verdict
here,
she
presumably
would
have
instructed
the
jury
the
same
way,
and
the
jury
would
have
also
acquitted
mr.
evans
for
the
same
reason.
and
so,
to
try
and
tease
out
legal
and
factual
errors,
especially
when
--
and
often
there
are
mixed
questions
of
fact
or
law
that
are
at
stake
here,
i
think
is
a
losing
proposition.
i
think
it
--
i
think
the
court
has
decided
to
draw
a
firm
line,
recognizing
that
an
acquittal
is
special.
an
acquittal
is
the
most
fundamental
thing
that
can
happen.
mr.
david
a.
moran
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
right
for
mr.
evans
to
make
this
argument
pretrial,
because
it
was
only
with
the
prosecution's
proof
that
it
became
clear
that
what
the
prosecution
was
proving
was
that
the
building
burned
was,
in
fact,
a
dwelling
house
and
therefore,
seemed
to
be
excluded
by
the
statutory
language
and
especially
the
commentary
to
the
jury
instructions
from
the
definition
of
the
offense.
michigan
is
an
information
state.
michigan
does
not
require
an
indictment
that
lists
every
--
every
little
bit
of
the
crime
and
all
of
the
details.
all
michigan
requires
is
a
very
simple
statement
of
the
crime
and
the
statutory
citation.
and,
of
course,
who
the
defendant
is
and
the
date
and
venue
of
the
alleged
crime.
and
so,
here
mr.
evans
would
have
had
no
way
of
knowing
in
advance
what
the
prosecution
was
going
to
prove.
that's
why
this
case
is
unlike
lee.
lee
is
an
effective
indictment.
nobody
claims
that
mr.
lee
was
innocent
and
that
the
prosecution
couldn't
prove
the
elements
of
the
crime
against
mr.
lee.
the
problem
was
just
that
the
indictment
failed
to
allege
a
specific
fact.
and
that--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--mr.
evans,
no.
he
was
charged
with
burning
other
real
property.
mr.
david
a.
moran
burning
other
real
property.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
the
--
that
--
that
statute.
i
have--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--it's
the
exception
to
the
dwelling
statute.
it's
--
it's
750.73,
which
is
on
page
2
of
the
top
side
brief.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no.
mr.
david
a.
moran
no,
he
was
charged
with
the
crime
in
750.7
--
750.73,
which
reads
in
relevant
part
that
"a
person
who
willfully
or
maliciously
burns
any
building
or
other
real
property,
or
the
contents
thereof,
other
than
those
specified
in
the
next
proceeding
subsection.
"
--“
subsection
of
this
chapter
”.
and
the
next
proceeding
section
of
the
chapter
is
about
burning
down
dwelling
houses.
mr.
david
a.
moran
it
was
--
it
was
allegedly
a
vacant
house.
and
apparently
that's
why
the
prosecution
charged
it
this
way.
mr.
david
a.
moran
so
they
charged
it.
they
are
the
ones
who
made
the
choice
of
which
statute
to
apply.
they
apparently
thought
that
they
couldn't
prove
that
it
was
a
dwelling
house,
so
they
proved
the
other
crime.
and
the
thinking
--
the
thinking
of
the
defense
attorney
and
the
thinking
of
the
judge
was
that
these
two
crimes
were
complementary
to
each
other;
in
other
words,
that
they
did
not
overlap.
it
was
either
a
dwelling
house
or
not
a
dwelling
house,
and
then
one
statute
or
the
other
applies.
as
a
result
of
the
ruling
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
which
is
now
not
contested,
in
fact
the
burning
--
the
--
the
statute
under
which
mr.
evans
was
charged
totally
encompasses
the
greater
crime,
because
any
building
is
covered
in
the
crime
with
which
mr.
evans
is
charged,
while
only
specific
buildings,
dwelling
houses,
are
charged
in
the
arson--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--well,
there--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--you
can
only
get
the
greater
offense.
mr.
david
a.
moran
yes.
but
a
jury
would
have
to
make
that
determination,
or
the
judge
in
a
bench
trial
would
have
to
make
that
determination
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
a.
moran
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
responding
to
mr.
gannon's
argument
first.
i
do
characterize
rumsey
as
an
additional
element
case.
and
i
also
characterize
it
as
a
misconstrued
element
case.
it's
a
perfect
example
of
how
these
cases
can
be
construed
either
way.
the
judge
required
a
contract.
you
can
call
that
an
additional
element
to
the
aggravating
circumstance,
or
you
can
call
it
as
a
misconstruction
of
what
pecuniary
gain
means
in
the
first
place.
the
same
here.
the
error
here
can
be
construed
as
a
misconstruction
of
the
element
that
the
property
burned
has
to
be
a
building,
and
the
judge
says,
"looking
at
the
statute,
i
construe
that
to
mean
a
particular
type
of
building.
"
or
it
can
be,
as
the
prosecution
construed
it,
as
the
addition
of
an
element.
there
is
no
difference
between
the
two
characterizations.
turning
to
the
--
the
broader
question
about
this
whole
line
of
cases,
and
should
this
court
go
back
and
revisit
this
whole
line
of
cases,
is
there
really
a
problem
here?
we
have
no
amicus
briefs
from
any
states
indicating
that
there's
a
problem.
we
have
only
the
amicus
from
the
united
states
saying
that
there's
a
problem.
is
there
a
problem
here
that
justifies
going
back
and
revisiting
50
years,
or
possibly
108
years,
all
the
way
back
to
kepner
--
all
of
this
case
law?
we
submit
not,
especially
since
as
this
court
noted
just
six
years
ago
in
smith,
there
is
an
easy
solution
if
there
really
is
a
problem.
if
there
really
is
a
problem
with
judges
going
wild
and
granting
directed
verdicts
mid-trial
for
no
apparent
reason,
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
the
states
can
fall
into
that,
as
we
can
say
judges
can't
do
that,
or
judges
as
an
intermediate
--
states
as
an
intermediate
step
could
at
least
give
judges
the
power
to
reserve
that
decision--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--i
would
be,
too,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
state
since
this
decision
--
since
this
court's
decision
in
smith
--
that
have
followed
nevada's
lead.
there
are
good
reasons
to
give
judges
this
acquittal
power.
namely,
preserve
the
state's
resources,
preserve
the
jury's
time,
and
present
--
prevent
the
defendant
from
having
to
go
through
a
trial
that
is
going
nowhere.
and
so
there
are
good
reasons
why
states
don't
do
this.
states
have
apparently
made
the
decision,
even
after
being
alerted
in
smith
that
there's
something
they
can
do
about
it,
that
the
good
of
giving
judges
this
mid-trial
directed
verdict
acquittal
power
outweighs
the
bad.
finally,
i'd
just
like
to
respond
to
mr.
baughman's
point,
and
it
was
also
raised
by
mr.
gannon,
about
how
jury
verdicts
are
different.
there's
something
special
about
jury
verdicts,
because
we
don't
always
know
why
they
granted
the
verdict.
but
we
have
the
same
problem
with
judicial
directed
verdicts.
and
we
have
martin
linen,
where
the
judge
just
says,
"this
is
the
weakest
case
i
have
ever
seen.
"
we
have
smalis,
where
he
just
says
it's
legally
insufficient.
if
the
court
adopts
the
line
that
the
prosecution
and
the
solicitor
general
would
have
you
adopt,
you're
going
to
have
to
require
judges
to
give
very
specific
findings
as
to
what
the
elements
of
the
offense
are,
and
which
ones
that
they
don't
find.
and
that
itself
would
require
a
radical
reworking
of
this
court's
jurisprudence.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
david
a.
moran
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
