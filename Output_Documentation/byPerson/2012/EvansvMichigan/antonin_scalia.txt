justice
antonin
scalia
because
i
suppose
the
judge
is
the
government,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
whether
the
unfairness
adheres
in
the
prosecution
or
in
the
judge,
the
guy's
been
treated
unfairly.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel
often
encourage
judges
to
do
the
wrong
thing.
in
fact,
in
every
case,
there
is
one
of
the
two
counsel
urging
the
court
to
do
the
wrong
thing;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
adversary
system
consists
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
--
if
the
judge
did
this
on
her
own,
that
would
have
been
okay,
and
there
would
be
double
jeopardy
attaching?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
have
to
decide
in
each
case
whether
the
defendant
was
the
initiating
source
of
the
error?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
defendant
just
agrees
with
the
judge?
the
judge
says,
you
know,
i
think
this
indictment
is
bad
because
you
--
you
have
to
show
that
it
wasn't
a
dwelling
place,
and
the
counsel
for
--
says,
yeah,
that
seems
like
a
good
--
a
good
idea.
is
--
is
that
enough
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
my
goodness,
disagreement
would
be
malpractice,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
bird
in
the
hand,
counsel.
i
--
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
we
didn't
have
it,
at
the
time
of
the
founding,
any
mechanism
for
a
judge
to
do
that.
i
mean,
this
--
this
is
a
new
procedure,
and
how
it
fit
into
the
prohibition
of
double
jeopardy
was
certainly
a
--
an
open
question.
it's
not
as
though
this
procedure
existed
at
the
time
of
the
founding
or
in
english
law
before
then,
and
was
never
adequate
to
--
to
constitute
double
jeopardy.
it's
a
new
procedure
introduced,
so
the
question
for
the
court
was,
well,
you
know,
if
it's
the
judge
rather
than
the
jury
that
pronounces
the
acquittal,
does
--
does
that
constitute
double
jeopardy?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
every
misinterpretation.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
this
case
doesn't
involve
simply
a
misinterpretation
of
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
are.
i
mean,
any
misinterpretation
you
can
--
which
goes
beyond
the
minimum
that
the
--
that
the
statute
requires
can
be
recharacterized
as
adding
an
additional
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
that
your
--
your
approach
doesn't
solve
the
bench
trial
problem
any
more
than
your
friend's
approach,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
finish
the
sentence.
notwithstanding
that,
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
important,
“
at
defendant's
behest
”?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
--
you're
arguing
that
this
should
only
--
only
be
--
this
rule
should
only
be
applied
when
the
defendant
asks
for
it.
