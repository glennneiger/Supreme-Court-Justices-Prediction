justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
under
the
sherman
act
before
rule
23
existed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
there
was
such
as
thing
as
class
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
thing
would
have
been
true.
if,
indeed,
your
claim
was
so
small
that
you
can't
claim
--
can't
pay
an
expert,
you
as
a
practical
matter
don't
bring
the
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
american
express
wouldn't
have
had
to
agree
to
arbitration
at
all,
right?
they
could
have
just
said,
you
know,
you
--
you
have
a
cause
of
action,
you
sue
us
in
court,
right?
they
could
say
that,
legally,
couldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
until
rule
23
was
adopted,
that
would
mean,
you
know,
if
you
had
a
small
claim,
tough
luck,
right?
de
minimis
non
curate
lex.
if
it's
just
negligible,
it's
impracticable
for
you
to
bring
a
federal
claim.
and
that
would
not
violate
the
sherman
act,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
could
borrow
the
money
from
a
lawyer
instead
of
from
the
trade
association,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
see
how
a
federal
statute
is
frustrated
or
is
unable
to
be
vindicated
if
it's
too
expensive
to
bring
a
federal
suit.
that
happened
for
years
before
there
was
such
a
thing
as
class
action
in
federal
courts.
nobody
thought
the
sherman
act
was
a
dead
letter,
that
it
couldn't
be
vindicated.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
different
when
you
transpose
the
situation
to
the
--
to
the
arbitration
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
--
i
don't
understand.
you
think
they
could
have
appealed
on
that
--
on
that
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
you.
your
effective
vindicability
principle
depends
upon
a
comparison
with
what
you
could
do
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
if
you
couldn't
do
it
--
if
you
couldn't
do
it
either
--
even
if
there
had
been
no
arbitration
agreement,
how
could
the
arbitration
agreement
be
--
be
harming
you?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
in
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
compare
it
to
court.
if
you
couldn't
do
it
in
court,
you
don't
have
to
be
able
to
do
it
in
arbitration,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
write
a
treatise
on
it,
maybe.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
this
class
could
not
--
could
not
qualify
for
certification
in
federal
court.
are
you
asserting
that
there
is
some
arbitration
principle
that
--
that
allows
you
to
create
some
new
class?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
make
--
you
have
to
make
a
comparison
to
what
can
be
done
in
federal
court,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't.
so
that
any
class
that
the
arbitrator
thinks
is
okay
is
required.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
wants
a
class.
what
he
wants
in
arbitration
is
the
ability
to
sue
on
behalf
of
a
class,
doesn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
--
is
that
what
you
asked
for
below,
anything,
class
action
or
compensation
or
whatever?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought.
that's
what
i
thought
this
case
was
about.
what's
the
question
presented
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
--
whether
the
federal
arbitration
act
permits
courts
invoking
the
federal
substantive
law
of
arbitrability
to
invalidate
arbitration
agreements
on
the
ground
that
they
do
not
permit
class
arbitration
of
a
federal
law
claim.
now,
you're
saying
that
--
that
whether
they
permit
class
arbitration
is
not
going
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
whether
you
could
certify
a
class
under
rule
23,
but
just
what?
and
--
and
--
and
if
it
does
depend
on
that,
what
is
the
court
supposed
to
do?
before
it
can
--
it
can
give
you
your
claim,
it
has
to
--
it
has
to
decide
whether
this
class
would
be
certifiable,
wouldn't
it?
my
goodness--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
is
a
very
complicated
procedure.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
should
have
said,
“
i
accept
”,
very
quickly.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
the
case
even
before
rule
23
was
--
was
adopted?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
you
couldn't
vindicate
it
in
the
federal
courts,
you
must
be
able
to
vindicate
it
in
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
even
talking
about
a
pure
exculpatory
clause.
i'm
talking
about
the
mere
fact
that
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
impossible
to
bring
it
in
arbitration.
in
a
context
in
which
it
is
also
impossible
to
bring
it
in
federal
court.
and
you
would
say,
still,
you
must
permit
it
to
be
brought
in
arbitration,
even
though
it
can't
be
brought
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
are
the
arbitration
fees?
it's
not
--
not
--
not
lawyers'
fees.
do
they
include
lawyers'
fees?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
i
don't
know,
what
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
what
are
you
comparing
it
to
in
court
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
filing
fee?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
they
didn't
get
cert
granted
on
that
question
at
all.
as
i
pointed
out
before,
they
got
it
granted
on
whether
the
mere
fact
that
the
arbitration
agreement
did
not
permit
class
arbitration
renders
it
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
the
question
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
to
hear
the
answer,
if
nobody--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondents
are
merchants
who
accept
the
american
express
cards.
their
agreement
with
petitioners,
american
express
and
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
american
express,
contains
a
clause
that
requires
all
disputes
between
the
parties
to
be
resolved
by
arbitration.
that
agreement
also
prohibits
“any
claims
to
be
arbitrated
on
a
class-action
basis.”
despite
this
arbitration
agreement,
respondents
brought
a
class-action
in
court
against
petitioners
for
violations
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
petitioners
moved
to
compel
individual
arbitration
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
in
resisting
the
motion,
respondents
argued
that
the
cost
of
an
expert
analysis
necessary
to
prove
the
antitrust
claims
would
greatly
exceed
the
maximum
recovery
for
any
individual
plaintiff.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
compel
individual
arbitration
and
dismissed
the
lawsuit.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
it
held
that
because
respondents
had
established
that
they
would
incur
prohibitive
costs
if
compelled
to
arbitrate
under
the
class-action
waiver,
the
waiver
was
unenforceable
and
the
arbitration
could
not
proceed.
the
court
of
appeals
stood
by
its
reversal
when
we
remanded
in
light
of
stolt-nielsen
versus
animalfeeds
international
corporation
which
held
that
a
party
may
not
be
compelled
to
submit
the
class
arbitration
absent
in
agreement
to
do
so.
we
granted
certiorari
and
today
reversed.
the
federal
arbitration
act
does
not
permit
courts
to
invalidate
a
contractual
waiver
of
class
arbitration
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiff's
cost
of
individually
arbitrating
a
federal
statutory
claim
exceeds
the
potential
recovery.
courts
must
rigorously
enforce
arbitration
agreements
according
to
their
terms
unless
the
act's
mandate
has
been
overridden
by
a
contrary
congressional
command.
no
contrary
congressional
command
requires
us
to
reject
the
waiver
of
class
arbitration
here.
the
antitrust
laws
do
not
guarantee
an
affordable
procedural
path
to
the
vindication
of
every
claim
or
evince
an
intention
to
preclude
a
waiver
of
class-action
procedure.
respondents
invoke
a
judge-made
exception
to
the
federal
arbitration
action,
which
they
say,
allows
courts
to
invalidate
agreements
that
prevent
“effective
vindication”
of
a
federal
statutory
right.
that
exception
finds
its
origin
in
the
desire
to
prevent
“prospective
waiver
of
a
party's
right
to
pursue
statutory
remedies,”
but
the
fact
that
it
is
not
worth
the
expense
involved
improving
a
statutory
remedy
does
not
constitute
elimination
of
the
right
to
pursue
that
remedy.
the
class-action
waiver
merely
limits
arbitration
to
the
two
contracting
parties.
it
no
more
eliminates
the
parties'
rights
to
pursue
their
statutory
remedy
than
did
federal
law
before
its
adoption
of
the
class-action
for
damages.
our
decision
in
at&t
mobility
versus
concepcion
all
but
resolves
this
case.
there,
in
finding
that
a
law
that
conditioned
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
on
the
availability
of
class
procedure
interfered
with
fundamental
arbitration
attributes,
we
specifically
rejected
the
argument
that
class
arbitration
was
necessary
to
prosecute
claims
that
“might,
otherwise,
slip
through
the
legal
system.”
the
regime
established
by
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
would
require
before
a
plaintiff
could
be
held
to
contractually
agreed
bilateral
arbitration
that
a
federal
court
determine
and
the
parties
litigate
the
legal
requirements
for
--
for
success
on
the
merits
claim-by-claim
and
theory-by-theory,
the
evidence
necessary
to
meet
those
requirements,
the
cost
of
developing
that
evidence,
and
the
damages
that
would
be
recovered
in
the
event
of
success.
such
a
preliminary
litigating
hurdle
would
undoubtedly
destroy
the
prospect
of
speedy
resolution
that
arbitration
in
general
and
bilateral
arbitration
in
particular
was
meant
to
secure.
the
federal
arbitration
act
does
not
sanction
such
a
judicially
created
superstructure.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
kagan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
breyer
joined.
justice
sotomayor
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
