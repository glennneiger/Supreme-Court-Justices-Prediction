mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
scope
and
continuing
existence
of
a
doctrine
that
has
been
a
feature
of
this
court's
cases
and
a
necessary
corollary
of
its
willingness
to
extend
arbitration
to
federal
statutory
claims,
the
vindication
of
rights
doctrine.
ever
since
this
court
30
years
ago,
roughly,
got
in
the
business
of
extending
arbitration
to
federal
statutory
claims,
it's
used
the
effective
vindication
doctrine
as
an
assurance
that
federal
statutory
claims
would
not
go
unvindicated
just
because
of
the
arbitral
forum.
and
so,
if
you
look
at
this
court's
cases,
they
stand
for
a
simple
proposition.
when
the
choice
is
arbitration
or
litigation,
surely
the
faa
favors
arbitration
and
it's
no
threat
to
the
underlying
statute,
because
the
underlying
statutory
claim
is
vindicated
in
the
arbitral
forum.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
scalia,
let
me
take--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
scalia,
let
me
take
on
the
premise
and
then
we
get
--
then
also
say
where
really
the
concern
comes
in
for
the
differential
treatment.
i
would
take
issue
with
the
premise,
which
is,
sure,
there
wasn't
a
sherman
act
--
there
wasn't
a
class
action
rule
23
back
when
the
sherman
act
was
first
passed.
but
there
were
procedures
in
like
joinder
that
allowed
for
multiple
claims
to
be
litigated
together;
there
were
not
confidentiality
agreements
that
came
in
and
limited
your
ability
to
share
information
from
one
claim
to
another,
and,
of
course,
back
in
the
good
old
days,
you
didn't
necessarily
need
a
$300,000
expert
to
bring
a
sherman
act
claim.
but
what
i
think
is
the
problem
is
when
you
have
a
difference,
and
that
is
the
assumption
on
which
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
where
you
could
vindicate
this
claim
in
court,
because
there
are
mechanisms
to
share
or
shift
costs
and
you
cannot
vindicate
them
in
the
arbitration
because
of
a
combination
of
features
of
the
arbitration
agreement
that
prevent
any
sharing
or
shifting
of
costs.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
you
could
do
it
by
category,
and
i
suppose
you
could
treat
antitrust
claims
differently,
but
i
think
there's
an
answer
that's
already
built
into
the
court's
cases,
which
is
randolph,
and
it's
putting
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
make
a
nonspeculative
showing.
and
in
the
case
you've
described,
i
would
think
you
would
say:
boy,
that's
speculative.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
don't
need
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
--
well,
don't
be
too
concerned,
justice
breyer.
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
cases
where
the
doctrine's
been
applied,
it's
largely
been
in
antitrust
cases.
the
first
circuit
kristian
case
is
an
antitrust
case.
and
i
don't
think
that's
an
accident.
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
hovenkamp
amicus
brief,
it
make
clear
that
you
just
can't
bring
this
type
of
claim--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
justice
breyer,
none
of
us
can
know
for
sure
what
professor
arita
would
say.
but
we
know
what
professor
hovenkamp
says,
and
he
says
to
bring
these
claims
you
need
an
expert.
now,
in--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--he
says
in
arbitration
or
anywhere.
he
assumes
that
anywhere
you
bring
these
claims,
you're
going
to
need
a
market
power
expert.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
what
i
would
say,
justice
breyer,
is
the
place
for
that
debate,
if
it
were
going
to
take
place,
was
in
the
district
court.
because
we
made
our
case,
as
randolph
requires
--
and
it
was
a
nonspeculative
case.
we
said
it's
going
to
cost
$300,000
to
$500,000
or
even
a
million
dollars
to
get
a
market
power
expert.
they
didn't
come
back
and
say:
no,
in
arbitration,
i
think
you
can
do
it
for
50,000.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
what
you
do
is
you,
with
all
due
respect,
fault
petitioners
for
that.
because
we
put
in
that
report
--
they
could
have
criticized
it
exactly
the
way
you
are
and
we'd
have
a
different
case.
but
they
argued
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
just
what
they
argued
to
you,
justice
kennedy,
it
doesn't
matter
if
you
can
do
it.
it
doesn't
matter
if
it's
too
expensive.
we
don't
think
this
doctrine
exists,
or
we
don't
think
it
extends
to
this
kind
of
cases,
and
having
put
their
--
their
money
on
that
extreme
position
that
the
effective
vindication
doctrine
doesn't
exist,
i
think
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
our
--
our
view
on
that
is
--
you
know,
the
court
is
balancing
two
things
here.
it's
trying
to
apply
the
effective
vindication
doctrine,
but
it's
also
trying
to
honor
the
principle
of
this
court
that
you
treat
the
parties
to
the
bargain
that
they
have
committed.
now,
if
they
would
have
come
in
and
said
in
the
district
court
--
which
they
didn't
--
that
we'll
get
rid
of
the
confidentiality
--
they
said
you
could
share
costs,
but
they
--
you
know,
the
confidentiality
was
the
problem.
it
was
the
problem
the
second
circuit
saw.
you
can
look
at
92a
of
the
petition
appendix.
and
they
didn't
petition
on
that
issue,
so
i
don't
know
how
they
get
to
say,
well,
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
about
that,
but
isn't
that
a
shame.
i
mean,
if
they
thought
that
was
wrong,
they
should
have
petitioned.
and
that
just
shows
you,
these
issues
were
in
front
of
the
court.
now--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
i
don't
think
this
court
would
have
necessarily
granted
it,
because
it's
not
very
cert-worthy.
but
it's
also
--
i
don't
know
how
they
can
keep
that
issue
in
their
back
pocket
and
then
say
well,
we
got
cert
--
we
got
cert
on
the
cert-worthy
issue
and
now
we
have
this
factual
finding
where
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
confidentiality
agreement
precludes
the
sharing
of
this
information
from
arbitration
to
arbitration.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
doesn't,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
doesn't.
it's
a
simple
comparison
of
the
necessary
unrecoupable
costs
of
bringing
the
claim
in
arbitration
compared
to
the
maximum
recovery.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
a
claim,
justice
scalia,
that
can't
be
vindicated
in
arbitration
or
in
court,
that
claim's
not
going--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
but
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
scalia,
you
don't
have
to
make
that
comparison
part
of
the
test,
because
the
cases
that
can't
be
vindicated
in
either
place
won't
show
up
at
the
courthouse
door.
so
once
you
show
up
at
the
courthouse
door,
you've
got
a
plaintiff's
lawyer.
they
may
be
crazy,
but
you
have
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
that
thinks
i
can
do
this
in
the
litigation
system.
and
so
at
that
point,
the
only
question
is,
all
right,
i
think
i
can
do
this
in
the
litigation
system.
if
the
only
thing
that's
precluding
me
from
doing
it
is
this
arbitration
agreement
--
so
this
arbitration
agreement
is
not
operating
as
a
real
arbitration
agreement,
it's
operating
as
a
de
facto
as-applied
exculpatory
clause.
if
they
can
make
that
showing,
then
--
and
the
option
is
not
arbitration
or
litigation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
--
and
god
bless
it,
justice
kennedy
--
when
it
does
that,
and
it
can
effectively
address
claims
that
can't
be
addressed
in
the
litigation
system,
that's
exactly
what
we
want
arbitration
to
do.
but
there
are
some
cases
where
the
arbitration
system
--
not
generally
--
i
mean,
if
you
have
the
kind
of
pro-vindication
agreement
you
had
in
concepcion,
or
that
sovereign
bank
had
that
we
mentioned
in
our
brief,
then
you
can
vindicate
these
claims
in
arbitration.
but
when
you
have
a
specific
arbitration
agreement
that
has
a
variety
of
clauses
that
don't
allow
for
any
mechanism
to
shift
or
share
the
costs,
so
you
know
it's
not
litigation
versus
arbitration,
of
course
we'll
go
with
arbitration.
it's
litigation
or
nothing.
in
those
circumstances,
this
court
has
always
said
that
we'll
have--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well
--
and,
justice
kennedy,
i
would
say
that
--
i
mean,
shame
on
them,
with
all
due
respect.
because
there
was
an
opportunity
in
the
district
court
to
make
an
apples
to
apples
comparison,
and
they
could
have
said:
no,
$300,000
is
way
off;
you
can
do
this
for
$25,000,
and
here's
how.
but
they
didn't
make
that
showing.
they
said:
you
know,
we
don't
think
the
effective
vindication
doctrine
applies
in
these
circumstances
at
all.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
they
don't
have
to
say
--
you
know
--
they
don't
have
to
tell
us
how
to
prove
our
case
to
the
lowest
possible
price.
they
just
have
to
show
us
something
that
will
allow
us
to
vindicate
our
claim--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
what
i'm
going
to
say,
justice--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
--
but
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
look,
i
mean,
take
a
step
back.
you
know,
one
of
the
great
things
about
the
effective
vindication
doctrine
is
it
gets
the
incentives
rights.
it
gives
companies
incentives
to
draft
clauses
that
will
allow
for
the
maximum
vindication
of
federal
rights.
and
so
there
are
lots
of
clauses
out
there
that
would
allow
for
even
this
claim,
because
they
have
cost
shifting
of
expert
costs
or
they
don't
have
confidentiality
agreements
or
they'll
waive
the
confidentiality--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
it's
not
part
of
the
inquiry
because--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it's
just
that
by
virtue
of
showing
up
in
court
and
saying,
i
want
to
litigate
my
claim,
the
lawyer
has
already
made
a
judgment
that
i
can
vindicate
it
in
federal
court.
maybe
it's
because
of
class
action,
maybe
it's
just
because
of
joinder,
maybe
it's
because
there's
no
confidentiality
rule
in
the
federal
proceedings,
so
it
can
bring
a
lot
of
these
claims,
maybe
it's
a
difference
in
collateral
estoppel.
whatever
it
is,
that
lawyer
has
already
spoken
that
i
can
make
this
claim
work
in
litigation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that
might
be
what
they
most
want,
but
they
don't
get
that.
they
just
get
some
way
to
vindicate
the
claim.
and
if
this
had
a
cost-shifting
provisions
that
the
expert
costs
were
shifted,
that
would
get
the
job
done,
that's
the
sovereign
bank
example
we
talked
about
in
our
brief.
there
are
more
than
one
way.
we're
not
trying
to
get
a
guarantee
for
class
treatment
in
one
form
or
the
other.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
--
in
fairness,
we
focused
below
on
the
class
action
because
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
don't
just
look
at
the
question
presented,
look
at
the
opinion
below.
and
look
at
91(a)
and
92(a).
the
questions
that
the
second
circuit
addressed--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it
would
not--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--your
honor.
you
just
have
to
answer
the
question,
is
there
a
problem
with
the
arbitration,
is
there
something
with
this
specific
agreement
that
precludes
this
claim
going
forward.
here
it's
a
combination
of
no
class
arbitration,
no
way
to
shift
costs,
because
they
don't
provide
cost
shifting,
and
no
way
to
share
costs
because
of
the
confidentiality.
whatever
they
put
in
the
question
presented,
they
can't
make
the
second
circuit's
holding
that
the
confidentiality
provision
blocks
the
sharing
of
information
to
go
away.
they're
stuck
with
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
they
--
they
could
do
that
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
critical
point
at
which
the
confidentiality
provision
creates
a
practical
problem
is
you're
trying
to
get
all
the
information,
you're
trying
to
get
a
single
expert
report
in
order
to
share
the
costs,
and
you're
trying
to
do
not
just
the
market
survey,
but
do
a
damage
calculation,
have
a
damage
formula.
because
when
you
have
a
market
like
this
where
the
allegations
are
they've
distorted
the
market,
so
we
can't
rely
on
the
market
price,
we
need
to
know
the
sales
volumes
of
all
the
individual
stores.
their
confidentiality
agreement
protects
that
and
doesn't
allow
that
to
be
shared.
that's
not
that
unusual.
this
court
in
nielsen
and
concepcion
both
remarked
that
one
of
the
features
of
arbitration
is
you
generally
keep
it
confidential.
and
that's
something
that
the
second
circuit
said,
because
of
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
all
due
respect,
mr.--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
mean,
i
don't
think
it's
that
difficult,
mr.
chief
justice.
certainly,
cost
shifting
is
not
difficult,
and
there
are
other
ways
to
solve
this
problem.
but
the
amex
agreement
forecloses
all
of
them.
and
the
question
for
this
court
is,
do
you
say,
well,
tough
or
do
you
say
what
you've
said
every
time
you've
confronted
this
problem,
the
effective
vindication
doctrine
provides
the
solution.
thank
you.
