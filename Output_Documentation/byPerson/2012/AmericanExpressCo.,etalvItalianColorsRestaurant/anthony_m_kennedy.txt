anthony
m.

one
of
the
ways
i
have
been
thinking
about
this
case
is
to
think
about
arbitration
and
the
whole
point
of
arbitration
is
to
have
a
procedure
where
you
don't
have
costs,
you
have
as
an
arbitrator
an
antitrust
expert
or
the
best
in
the
class
in
the
third
year
antitrust
course
in
law
school.
and
they
cite
reports,
and,
you
know,
it's
classic
to
have
contractors
sit
in
as
arbitrators
in
construction
claims;
just
because
it's
cheaper
and
they
know
--
so
i
was
thinking
that
that's
substantial
justification
for
your
position.
but
your
argument
so
far
seems
to
say
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
even
if
they
can't
bring
the
suit
in
an
economic
way,
the
arbitration
in
an
economic
way,
that
that's
irrelevant.
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
getting
from
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
it's
saying
that
there's
an
alternate
mechanism
for
resolving
disputes.
it's
called
arbitration.
and
arbitration
does
not
necessarily
or
even
as
a
matter
of
fact
often
as
a
practical
matter
involve
the
costs
and
formalities
of
litigation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean
maybe
it
is
litigation
if
you
need
a
$300,000
report.
but
why
do
you
need
a
$300,000
report?
that's
what
we're
asking.
and
i
just
can't
--
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
to
engage
in
speculation
about
the
limits
of
arbitration
in
order
to
resolve
in
your
favor.
now,
to
be
sure,
they
took
a
--
a
more
rigid
view
below,
so
we
don't
have
much
of
a
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
we
have
a
factual
record?
suppose
i
think,
based
in
substantial
part
on
justice
breyer's
suggestion,
that
we
could
have
an
arbitration
that's
effective
and
we
could
have
a
trade
association
prepare
a
report,
and
we
could
do
one
arbitration
and
then
see
if
it
applies
to
others.
suppose
i
think
that.
do
i
--
doesn't
that
bear
on
this
question?
and
if
it
does,
i
don't
have
a
factual
record
to
support
my
assumptions.
