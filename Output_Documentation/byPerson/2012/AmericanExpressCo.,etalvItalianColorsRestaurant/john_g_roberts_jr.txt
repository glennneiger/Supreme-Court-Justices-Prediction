chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
case
number
12-133,
american
express
v.
italian
colors
restaurant.
mr.
kellogg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
a
little
confused
about
this
business
about
pooling
resources
and
whether
it's
prohibited
or
permitted.
tell
me
exactly
what
your
position
is
on
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
i
don't
see
how
that
concession
is
at
all
needed
by
the
other
side.
i
mean,
let's
just
say
they
have
a
trade
association
or
something.
they
--
they
can
all
get
together
and
say
we
want
to
prepare
an
antitrust
expert
report
about
what
american
express
is
doing,
and
they
do,
and
then
presumably,
one
of
them
can
use
it
in
the
arbitration.
any
problem
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
again,
that
doesn't
seem
too
difficult.
you
either
have
your
trade
association
or
you
have
a
big
meeting
of
all
them
and
say
we
need
to
pay
for
this
expert
report
and
once
we've
got
it,
you
know,
i'm
going
to
represent
each
of
you
individually
in
individual
arbitrations
and
i'm
going
to
win
the
first
one,
and
then
the
others
are
going
to
fall
into
place
and
they'll
get
a
settlement
from
american
express
that's
going
to
be
--
satisfy
their
concerns.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
and
you
have
no
problem
with
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
just
to
follow-up
one,
briefly.
is
the
--
is
there
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
the
arbitration
that
would
be
applied
to
subsequent--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
little
much
to
expect
them
to
come
back
and
say:
oh
no,
no,
no,
you
don't
have
to
prove
all
this.
the
only
thing
you've
got
to
prove
is
it's
going
to
cost
you
$25,000.
that's
an
odd
position
to
put
them
in.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
--
tell
me
how
the
no
--
no
sharing
of
information
and
confidentiality,
how
does
that
work
again?
you
can't,
if
you're
a
trade
association,
get
together
and
say,
i
think
we
should
have
a
study
of
amex's
whatever.
and
then
you
put
together
the
study,
and
then
one
of
your
members
says,
you
know,
that's
a
good
study,
i'm
going
to
go
--
go
to
arbitration.
they
can't
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
you
do
--
i
mean,
what
if
you
do
it,
is
that
just
part
of
your
trade
associations,
they
think
this
is
--
you
know,
they're
not
talking
about
particular
arbitration
or
anything.
they
just
prepare
a
--
a
report,
and
then
once
you
see
the
report,
you
say,
my
gosh,
i
had
no
idea,
and
then
you
file
your
claim
for
arbitration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
my
point
is
simply
that
there's
no
sharing,
confidence,
it
seems
like
an
awfully
amorphous
provision
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
enforce.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
afford
you
some
rebuttal
time.
mr.
stewart?
oh,
no,
we
won't.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
being
generous
this
morning.
mr.
stewart?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
is
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kellogg,
you
have
rebuttal
time,
6
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-133,
american
express
versus
italian
colors
restaurant.
