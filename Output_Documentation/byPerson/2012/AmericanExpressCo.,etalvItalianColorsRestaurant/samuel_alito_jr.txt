justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
the
nature
of
their
underlying
--
their
antitrust
claim
is
relevant
to
this?
they
are
claiming
that
they
were
unlawfully
compelled
to
enter
into
the
contract
that
they
say,
as
a
practical
matter,
precludes
them
from
raising
the
antitrust
issue.
does
that
--
does
it
matter?
