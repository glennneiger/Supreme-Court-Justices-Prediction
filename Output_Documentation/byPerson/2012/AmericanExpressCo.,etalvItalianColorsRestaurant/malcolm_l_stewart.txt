mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument,
justice
kagan
asked
whether
a
pure
exculpatory
clause,
a
provision
in
a
contract
that
simply
said,
we
promise
not
to
seek
relief
under
the
arbitration
--
under
the
antitrust
clause
period
would
be
enforceable,
and
mr.
kellogg
replied
that
it
would
not.
and
i
think
the
unenforceability
of
such
a
provision
would
not
depend
on
any
analysis
of
what
was
likely
to
happen
if
the
suit
was
brought
in
court;
that
is,
a
pure
exculpatory
clause
could
be
set
aside
and
the
plaintiff
could
still
lose
for
any
number
of
reasons.
the
plaintiff
could
be
denied
class
certification
and
decide
it's
uneconomical
to
proceed
with
an
individual
suit.
he
could
lose
on
a
threshold
ground
like
the
statute
of
limitations
or
he
could
lose
on
the
merits.
but
the
unenforceability
of
the
pure
exculpatory
clause
wouldn't
require
the
court
to
make
a
comparison
between
being
kicked
out
of
court
on
that
basis
and
what
would
likely
happen
if
the
suit
were
able
to
be
brought.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
same
mode
of
analysis
applies
when
the
arbitration
agreement
can
be
shown
to
have
the
same
practical
effect
as
an
exculpatory
clause;
that
is,
if
it
is
the
case
that
given
the
amount
of
money
at
stake,
the
arbitration
procedure
specified
in
the
contract
and
the
modes
of
proof
that
would
be
necessary
in
arbitration,
if
it
can
be
shown
persuasively
by
the
plaintiff
who
bears
the
burden
that
no
reasonable
plaintiff
would
find
it
economically
feasible
to
proceed,
then
the
arbitration
agreement
can't
be
enforced--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes.
and
it
would
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
question
would
be
whether
the
arbitration
agreement
could
be
enforced.
and
before
rule
23
was
adopted,
if
there
had
been
a
pure
exculpatory
clause,
it
would
have
been
unenforceable
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--in
the
same
way
that
we
would
say
a
pure
exculpatory
clause
would
be
invalid
and
unenforceable,
even
if
it
were
clear
from
the
plaintiff's
complaint
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
relief
on
the
merits.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
and
i
would
make
two
real
world--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
the
attorneys'
fees
would
be
recoupable
under
the
substantive
law.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
are
not
really--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
think
we
are
not
comparing
it
to
anything.
that
is,
our
--
our
position
is
in
determining
whether
the
arbitration
agreement
has
the
same
practical
effect
as
an
exculpatory
clause,
we
asked
could
any
reasonable
plaintiff
proceed
under
the
terms
and
conditions
that
are
set
up?
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
then
the
arbitration
agreement
is
unenforceable.
now,
i
would
make
two
real-world
points,
one
of
which
mr.
clement
has
already
alluded
to.
the
first
is
the
only
cases
that
are
going
to
wind
up
in
court
are
those
in
which
the
plaintiff
at
least
believes
that
it
would
be
feasible
to
vindicate
the
claim
in
court,
and
so
they
are
likely
to
be
those
in
which
there
is
a
potential
difference
between
the
outcome
in
court
and
the
outcome
in
arbitration.
the
other
is,
even
if
a
plaintiff
believes
wrongly
that
he
can
proceed
in
court
through
a
class
action
mechanism
and
class
action
--
class
certification
is
denied
under
rule
23,
presumably
at
that
point
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
give
up
and
the
outcome
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
going
to
be
the
same
as
if
the
arbitration
agreement
had
been
enforced.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
let
me
start--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--let
me
start
with
your
last
question
and
work
backwards.
it
is
possible
and
it
sometimes
has
happened
in
the
lower
court
cases
that
a
plaintiff
will
come
into
court
and
say:
i
can't
proceed
through
arbitration
because
the
arbitral
fees
are
too
high
in
relation
to
my
likely
recovery.
and
the
defendant
at
that
point
will
say,
we
offer
to
waive
the
fees
or
we
offer
to
pay
your
share
of
the
arbitral
fees,
and
a
court
will
be
persuaded
that,
given
that
consensual
modification
of
the
contract,
it
is
feasible
for
the
claims
to
be
brought
in
arbitration
and
the
plaintiff
is
kicked
out
of
court.
now,
this
is
consensual.
this
is
something
that
the
court
has
--
that
the
court
has
done
at
the
company's
behest,
and
it
would
be
different
question
of
whether
the
court
could
do
that
over
the
company's
objection.
but
another
thing
that
the
company
could
do
is
put
in
a
severability
clause
in
the
contract
that
would
specify
what
results
should
obtain
if
one
provision
of
the
contract
were
held
to
be
invalid.
i
guess
another
thing
i
would
say
in
response
to
your
question
is
we
do
have
one
data
point,
the
first
circuit's
decision
in
kristian,
which
i
believe
mr.
clement
referred
to,
in
2006,
which
essentially
held
on
facts
similar
to
these
that
the
arbitration
clause
as
written
was
not
enforceable
because
the
cost
of
the
expert
fees
in
an
antitrust
case
would
dwarf
any
potential
recovery,
and
we
haven't
seen
the
floodgates
opened.
the
last
thing
i
would
say
is
if
this
is
the
concern,
petitioner's
proposed
rule
really
doesn't
match
the
argument
in
its
favor.
that
is,
petitioner
is
not
just
arguing
for
a
rule
that
would
cover
cases
in
which
the
relevant
costs
are
those
of
experts
or
similar
authorities.
petitioner's
rule
would
say
even
if
the
contract
provides
for
a
non-recoupable
$500
filing
fee
and
the
amount
of
the
claim
at
stake
is
$200,
so
it's
absolutely
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
contract
that
the
claim
can't
be
brought,
the
agreement
is
still
enforceable
and
the
plaintiff
is
deprived
of
his
day
in
court.
the
other
thing
i
would
say
about
petitioner's
argument
is
the
challenge
to
the
second
circuit's
decision
has
really
changed
drastically
since
the
cert
petition
was
filed.
that,
is
the
second
circuit
took
it
as
essentially
undisputed
that
the
costs
of
the
expert
report
would
render
it
economically
infeasible
to
proceed
in
arbitration,
and
it
took
the
further
step
of
saying,
therefore
the
arbitration
agreement
is
unenforceable.
now,
the
cert
petition
challenged
only
the
“
therefore
”
part
of
the
second
circuit's
analysis.
there
wasn't
a
suggestion
that
the
petitioner
intended
to
challenge
the
antecedent
determination
that
these
claims
couldn't
feasibly
have
been
brought
in
individualized
proceedings.
and
i
think
as
paul
--
mr.
clement
said,
the
likely
reason
is
that
wouldn't
look
like
a
cert-worthy
issue.
that
sort
of
fact-specific
inquiry
wouldn't
seem
like
a
wise
use
of
this
court's
resources.
so
having
gotten
cert
granted
on
the
important
legal
question
whether
the
inefficacy
of
arbitration
procedures
is
a
basis
for
invalidating
the
agreement,
petitioners
are
now
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
arguing
that
it
would
in
fact
have
been
feasible
to
pursue
these
claims
through
individualized
arbitration.
and
one
thing
we
would
say
in
response,
as
mr.
clement
said--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
they
did
get
cert--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--they
got
cert
granted
on
that
question,
but
neither
the
question
as
so
framed
or
the
body
of
the
cert
petition
suggests
any
challenge
to
the
second
circuit's
factual
determination
that
these
claims
could
not
feasibly
have
been
brought
in
individualized
arbitration.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
is
correct
that
it
has
to
be
one
on
one,
that
the
agreement
requires
only--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
the
agreement
prohibits
even
the
types
of
joinder
mechanisms
that
might
have
been
available
when
the
sherman
act
was
passed.
