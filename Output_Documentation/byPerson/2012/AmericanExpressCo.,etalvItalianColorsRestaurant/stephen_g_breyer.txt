justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
i
could
be
your
arbitrator.
i
know
exactly
what
i
would
do.
i
would
ask
for
five
things,
which
will
be
admitted,
and
one
thing
that's
going
to
be
difficult
for
them
to
prove.
i
don't
see
why
an
expert
in
antitrust
would
have
to
have
this
enormous
report.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
concede--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
maybe.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
want
to
argue
that
stuff,
which
i
--
then
i
guess
maybe
they're
right.
maybe
you
do
need
experts
on
that.
i
don't
know
that
we
want
to
get
into
this,
but
i
just
want
to
know
if
you
want
to
concede
that
there
is
no
way
to
win
this
case
in
arbitration
unless
they
spend
$300,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
before
you
get
to
that,
i
have
two
questions.
one
is
on
the
point
you've
just
made,
because
i
--
i
agree,
i
understand
it
is
fairly
well
established,
this
doctrine,
but
i
don't
see
quite
how
it
works.
suppose
there's
a
tyler
claim,
a
truth
in
lending
act,
you
know,
something
like
that,
and
the
claim
is
a
fairly
--
it's
worth
about
$10,000
or
so.
and
so
the
plaintiff
says
you
violated
the
act,
pay
me
the
$10,000.
now,
he
happens
to
come
up
with
a
theory
that
is
really
far
out;
and
the
more
far
out
the
theory,
the
harder
it
is
to
prove.
and
the
harder
it
is
to
prove,
the
more
you
need
expensive
experts.
and
do
we
go
case
by
case,
saying,
you
know,
you
have
a
really
weird
theory
that's
going
to
require
17
experts
and
endless
studies,
you
don't
have
to
have
an
arbitration
claim,
or
you
don't
have
to
follow
it
in
this
instance,
but
everybody
else
does.
now
--
now,
is
--
is
that
something,
in
other
words,
we're
supposed
to
look
at
case
by
case,
which
would
produce
the
odd
result
i
suggested?
or
do
we
do
it
by
categories?
how
does
the
doctrine
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
what
i'll
do,
because
i
work
with
my
own
hypothetical,
i'll
have
a
far-out
case,
but
yet
not
quite
speculative.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
it's
an
odd
doctrine
that
just
says,
plaintiff
by
plaintiff,
you
can
ignore
an
arbitration
clause
if
you
can
get
a
case
that's
expensive
enough,
and
there
we
are.
i
haven't
seen
it
work,
and
i
haven't
seen
enough
to
know
how
it
does
work.
and
i
guess
you
haven't
either,
but
--
but
i'm
concerned
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
sounds
expert
to
me.
now,
hovenkamp
would
be
the
person
i
would
hire
as
the
arbitrator.
so
surely
he
does
know
--
or
phil
arita
--
a
blessed
memory.
and
they're
under
the
instruction
to
get
this
done
cheap.
well,
i
think
that
might
be
possible.
that
might
be
possible,
because
it's
only
the
question
of
damages
that's
tough
here,
because
if
you
don't
have
the
double
--
there's
only
one
monopoly
profit
at
the
two
levels,
da,
da,
da,
and
we
don't
need
to
go
through
that.
but
i
can
think
of
a
way
of
getting
it
done
pretty
cheap.
but
regardless,
your
expert
here
didn't
talk
about
the
cost
of
arbitration.
he
did
use
the
word
once.
but
as
i
read
pages
88
through
92,
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
talking
about
the
cost
of
litigation,
not
the
cost
of
arbitration.
and
--
and
i
wouldn't
proceed
necessarily
with
all
those
reports
he
does
to
impress
to
the
jury,
or
even
the
judge.
this
is
phil
arita.
you
don't
need
to
impress
him.
and
--
so,
so,
so
--
hasn't
the
second
circuit
looked,
assuming
your
doctrine's
in
place,
to
the
wrong
set
of
costs:
the
cost
of
litigation?
even
though
they
use
the
word
“
arbitration
”,
that
isn't
what
your
expert
told
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
arbitration
or
in
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
he
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
can
be
him?
and
moreover,
could
in
fact
work
under
an
instruction
to
keep
these
costs
down?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that
isn't
the
point.
if
i
were
doing
this
offhand,
i
would
say
everything
is
conceded
but
for
one
thing:
since
there
is
no
double
monopoly
power,
there
is
only
one
monopoly
power
at
the
two
levels
which
can
be
exercised,
the
only
way
the
person
is
damaged
is
if
in
fact
you've
raised
entry
barriers.
so
you'd
say
to
the
plaintiff,
how
are
you
going
to
prove
that?
and
you'd
read
it
and
submit
a
report.
now,
i'm
not
saying
this
is
the
right
way
to
go
about
it.
all
i'm
saying
is
it's
hard
for
me
to
figure
out
on
the
basis
of
that
affidavit,
which
talks
about
courts,
why
this
has
to
be
so
expensive.
so
what
do
i
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
other
thing
which
i
didn't
understand,
and
that's
why
i
am
asking.
what
they
chose
as
the
remedy
here
was
sever
the
arbitration
clause
if
you
want,
it
seemed
to
be,
and
go
to
court.
all
right.
now,
i
don't
know
where
that
power
comes
from.
so
if
you
were
going
to
improve
this
contract
in
the
direction
that
you
would
like,
why
couldn't
you
sever
the
part
about
the
confidentiality,
or
why
couldn't
you
require
--
you
have
some
awfully
big
merchants.
like,
i
don't
know
--
probably,
you
have
maybe
costco,
maybe
walmart,
maybe
--
you
know,
these
people
are
not
without
money.
they're
your
client,
maybe.
but
--
go
get
these
contributions.
go
for
--
there
are
many
ways
you
can
treat
this
particular
set
of
words
in
the
arbitration
clause,
short
of
severing
it
entirely.
and
--
and
what
about
that?
what's
your
view
on
that?
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
authority
that
i
could
find
for
the
prop
--
i
mean,
if
in
fact
it
costs
you
$10,000
to
buy
the
arbitrator
--
system,
you
know,
you
buy
the
system--
[laughter]
sorry.
but
i
mean,
you
know,
hire
--
whatever
it
is,
if
those
are
obstacles,
it's
pretty
well
established,
i
think,
that
that
arbitration
is
not
something
that
you
can
use
to
vindicate
the
federal
claim.
and
the
part
that's
bothering
me
about
this,
though,
is
that
those
aren't
obstacles.
it's
just
you
brought
a
very
expensive
claim.
and
the
real
problem
here
is
the
reason
they
can
go
into
court
is
they
can
get
a
class
action
in
court.
and
then
this
court
has
said,
you
can't
get
the
class
action
in
arbitration.
there
we
have
it.
so
--
so
the
--
the
question
in
my
mind
is,
well,
is
there
a
way
that
some
of
the
beneficial
aspects
of
class
action
can
be
used
in
an
arbitration
that
does
not
formally
have
a
class
action?
and
there
it
seems
yours
is
a
good
case,
because
a
lot
of
them
can.
you
say,
well,
the
one
part
that
can't
is
getting
this
private
information.
so
maybe
we
should
send
it
back
and
say,
well,
why
do
you
need
the
private
information?
on
a
good
theory
of
antitrust,
you're
going
to
show
that
the
price
of
the
tide
product
was
higher
than
what
it
would
have
been
had
the
entry
barriers
not
been
raised
from
the
tide.
that's
a
general
entry
question
which
i
don't
think
you
need
private
information
from
them
to
answer.
but
that's
--
and
now
we're
really
into
the
depths
of
the
merits.
so
i
thought
of
sending
it
back
and
saying,
let's
--
let
them
explore
this
kind
of
thing
about
other
ways
of
trying
to
get
some
of
these
advantages
of
class
action
into
your
--
you're
going
to
say
i'm
too
far
out
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
expert
costs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
exactly
--
i
found
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
what
hinders
--
plenty
of
authority,
you
can't
make
the
person
go
to
arbitration
if
the
fees
involved
are
too
high,
because
he's
blocked.
but
you're
quite
an
advance
over
that.
you
are
saying
the
thing
that
keeps
him
out
is
his
own
theory
of
wrong,
which
will
involve
hiring
a
lot
of
experts
and
others.
now,
once
that's
adopted,
it
seems
to
me
in
practice
we
have
reversed
in
many,
many
cases
the
proposition
that
you
can
in
fact
require
federal
causes
of
action
to
be
arbitrated,
because
all
you
have
to
do
to
get
out
of
the
arbitration
is
to
allege
a
theory
of
your
case
which
is
hard
and
complicated
to
prove.
now
you
are
back
in
court.
now
that's
a
significant
erosion,
it
seems
to
me.
so
i
want
to
know
if
you
have
any
standard
there,
if
we're
just
supposed
to
accept
that,
if
in
fact
you
are
trying
to
reverse
in
practice
what
was
the
holding
that
you
can
arbitrate
these
federal
causes
of
action.
what
is
going
on
here?
and
an
addendum
to
that
is
if
you
are
going
to
convince
me,
which
you
might,
that,
well,
that's
okay,
do
it,
do
it,
do
it,
is
it
a
possible
remedy
to
monkey
with
the
arbitration
clause
and
provide
for
a
sharing
of
costs,
say
if
you
win
the
loser
will
pay
the
expert
fees,
which
is
of
course
a
much
more
pro-arbitration
way
than
just
throwing
it
out
entirely?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
long
question,
but
do
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
we
answer--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
question
--
the
answer
is
yes,
a
class
action
waiver
can
be
enforced.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
are
the
circumstances
here?
the
record
leaves
us
uncertain,
we
remand
it
for
further
consideration
of
what
they
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
that
isn't
the
issue
they
decided,
whether
it
could
be
enforced.
they
decided
whether
you
can
--
whether
the
whole
arbitration
agreement
could
be
enforced.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
you
have
to
do
without.
i
--
you
just
said
what
--
i
thought
that
the
expert
talked
about
litigation
costs,
not
about
arbitration
costs.
so
how
is
that
handled?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
said
you
waived
that
point,
whatever
--
however
it
is.
you
waived
it.
never
raised
it.
the
court
of
appeals
took
it
as
if
it
were
arbitration
costs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
believe
you.
