mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
below
thrice
refused
to
enforce
the
parties'
arbitration
agreement,
because
he
thought
that
class
procedures
were
necessary
to
vindicate
the
plaintiff's
sherman
act
claims.
that
holding
was
reversible
error
for
at
least
three
reasons.
first,
it
has
no
basis
in
either
the
faa
or
the
sherman
act.
second,
it
creates
an
unworkable
threshold
inquiry.
and
third,
it
is
unnecessary
to
any
legitimate
policy
concerns
raised
by
the
court
below.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
three
responses
to
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is,
that
it
is
up
to
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance
to
devise
procedures
to
deal
with
claims
in
an
efficient
and
cost-effective
manner.
second,
to
the
extent
that
an
expert
report
is
required
that
would
cost
a
lot
of
money,
we
have
conceded
below
that
the
parties
could
share
costs
of
that
expert
just
as
they
could
share
the
costs
of
a
lawyer.
and
third,
the
alternative
is
to
have
an
inquiry
upfront,
that
this
court
has
rejected
in
concepcion,
that
you
cannot
condition
the
enforcement
of
an
arbitration
agreement
on
the
availability
of
class
procedures.
it's
up
to--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--we
acknowledge
below
that
they
could
share
costs
among
multiple
plaintiffs--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--before
that.
the
sharing
of
costs.
now,
under
the
court
below's
regime--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--they
can
share
the
cost
of
the
expert.
and,
of
course,
they
get
their
attorneys'
fees
back,
plus
reasonable
statutory
costs,
plus
potentially
treble
damages.
the
alternative,
as
the
court
below
held,
is
that
the
district
court
has
to
decide
in
the
first
instance,
i'm
not
going
to
send
it
to
arbitration
because
i
think
they
need
a
class
action.
to
make
that
determination,
he
first
has
to
do
a
rule
23
analysis.
would
there
even
be
a
class
certified
in
this
case?
only
20
percent
of
putative
classes
are
certified.
and
that's
not
an
inquiry
that
the
court
should
be
making
at
the
outset.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
as
we
said,
they
would
be
able
to
share
an
expert
between
multiple
plaintiffs,
but
there
is
no
guarantee
in
the
law
that
every
claim
has
a
procedural
path
to
its
effective
vindication.
this
court
held
in
eisen,
for
example,
even
though
the
court
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
$70
claim,
it
could
only
be
brought
as
a
class
action,
but
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
said,
i
can't
afford
to
do
the
notice
costs,
and
the
court
said
well,
then,
the
class
is
decertified,
because
the
plaintiff
has
to
put
up
the
notice.
the
whole
point
of
arbitration
of
course
is
that
it
expands
the
universe
of
claims
that
can
be
brought
efficiently
and
effectively
for
small
consumers.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
under
this
court's
decision
in
mitsubishi,
i
believe
not.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
think
that
would
be
subject
to
review
under
state
unconscionability
principles,
and
would
probably
be
struck
down,
your
honor,
just
like
any
other
provision
that
essentially
prevents--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
--
i
don't
think
mitsubishi
can
be
read
that
broadly,
your
honor.
to
the
contrary,
the
whole
point
of
mitsubishi
was
that
arbitration
is
an
effective
forum
for
vindicating
federal
statutory
rights.
mitsubishi--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i'm
sorry.
mitsubishi
dealt
with
the
very
specific
question
of
a
waiver,
a
substantive
waiver
of
your
rights,
not
with
the
procedures
to
vindicate
those
rights.
as,
for
example,
in
the
vimar
seguros
case,
where
the
court
said,
well,
you
might
have
to
go
to
japan,
but
we're
not
going
to
get
into
the
business
of
weighing
the
costs
and
benefits.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
you
know,
i
think
the
better
place
to
handle
that
would
be
state
unconscionability
law.
whether
the
court
would
want
to
expand
the
ports
of
mitsubishi
to
say
that.
it's
not
clear
to
me
what
the
statutory
justification
for
that
would
be,
given
that
the
sherman
act
--
the
question
here,
of
course,
concerns
class
procedures.
and
given
that
the
sherman
act
was
passed
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
class
procedures,
and
given
that
the
court
in
concepcion--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
have
no
doubt
that
such
a
provision
would
be
struck
down.
i
think
the
proper
way
to
do
that
would
be
under
state
unconscionability
law,
which
section
2
specifically
preserves.
but
if
the
court
felt
the
need
to
expand
mitsubishi
in
that
narrow
respect,
that
would
still
not
help
the
respondents
here,
who
are
saying
that
you
should
condition
the
enforcement
of
the
arbitration
clause
on
the
availability
of
class
procedures,
which
this
court
held
in
concepcion
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
faa.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
think
--
i
think
not
true.
and
i
think
we
have
to
return
to
the
fact
that
the
only
provision
at
issue
here
was
the
class
action
waiver.
that
was
the
only
issue
that
they
raised
below.
it
was
the
issue
decided
by
the
court.
it
was
the
issue
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
and
it's
directly
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
concepcion.
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
there
were
provisions
in
a
contract
that
essentially
prevented
a
plaintiff
from
raising
a
substantive
claim
or
from
presenting
evidence
that
they
might
have
in
support
of
that
claim,
that
it
would
be
struck
down
under
state
unconscionability
principles
or
under
mitsubishi.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
expand
mitsubishi
into
a
free-floating
inquiry
for
district
courts
into
the
costs
and
benefits
of
each
case.
they
would
have
to
sit
down
and
say,
well,
what
evidence
is
going
to
be
needed
in
this
case
and
how
much
evidence
is
going
to
be
required.
they
would
have
to
say,
what
are
the
document
production
costs?
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they
would
even
need
to
say,
what
are
your
chances
of
winning?
because,
say
it's
going
to
cost
a
million
dollars
but
you
only
have
a
50
percent
chance--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--and
nobody
in
their
right
mind
in
eisen
would
pay
a
million
dollars
in
notice
costs
to
get
$70
on--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--you
could
have.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
under
that
position--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that
was
true.
in
fact,
congress
at
the
time
of
passing
the
sherman
act
specifically
considered
adding
class
procedures
and
declined
to
do
so.
for
the
first
4
decades
of
the
sherman
act,
there
were
no
class
procedures
even
left.
even
today,
in
court,
as
i
noted,
only
20
percent
of
cases
actually
get
the
class
certified.
the
whole
point
of
arbitration,
as
i
noted,
is
to
expand
the
scope
of
claims,
small
consumer
claims,
that
can
be
brought
in
an
efficient
and
cost-effective
manner.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
a
couple
of
points
on
that.
they
certainly
weren't
compelled
to
enter
the
contract.
lots
of
merchants
don't
take
american
express.
it
was
a
voluntary
choice
on
their
part.
but
more
fundamentally,
the
only
provision
that
they
have
ever
challenged
in
this
case
is
the
class
action
waiver.
they
have
not
suggested
below
that
there
was
any
problem
with
cost-sharing
or
other
ways
that
they
might
deal
with
the
specific
question
how
to
present
their
case
in
arbitration.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
quite
follow
that,
your
honor.
a
provision
in
the
arbitration
clause
that
makes
it
easier
to--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct,
there
were
provisions
in
at&t
that
the
court
said
would
make
small
value
claims
easier
to
process.
i
would
note
that
in
concepcion
the
court
said
even
if
small
value
claims
could
not
be
brought,
it
would
still
fundamentally
change
the
nature
of
arbitration
to
insist
upon
class
procedures.
so
i
don't
think
that
helped
them
in
distinguishing
concepcion.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that,
your
honor.
the
key
point
is
that
it's
up
to
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance
to
find
the
most
efficient
and
cost
effective
way
to
resolve
a
particular
claim.
and
it's
not
necessarily
the
case
that
complicated
--
that
huge
numbers
of
documents
--
plaintiff
said,
we
will
need
5
million
documents
and
we
will
need
a
very,
very
expensive
expert
and
they
got
an
affidavit
from
a
very,
very
expensive
expert
saying,
this
is
what
i
would
charge
to
do
this.
the
whole
point
of
arbitration,
of
course,
is
that
its
informality
actually
expands
the
universe
of
claims,
of
small
value
claims
that
can
be
brought
effectively.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
i
acknowledge
that
they
would
probably
need
a
report
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
--
perhaps
i--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--conceded
too
much
to
justice
kagan.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
in
this
case,
if
you
look
at
the
complaint,
the
market
definition
that
they're
seeking
to
establish
is,
if
i
might
put
it,
somewhat
gerrymandered.
it
essentially--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
did
not
mean
to
concede
that
at
all,
your
honor.
the
whole
point
of
arbitration
is
the
informality
and
the
speed
of
the
procedures.
and
in
addition,
to
the
extent
that
there
does
need
to
be
some
sort
of
safety
valve,
of
course
congress
can
deal
with
that
question.
congress
recently
in
the
dodd-frank
act
said,
in
certain
circumstances
we're
going
to
allow
the
consumer
financial
protection
board
to
determine
whether
class
action
waivers
will
be
permitted.
but
obviously
there's
nothing
either
in
the
faa
or
in
the
sherman
act
that
would
justify
such
an
inquiry
here.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
there
is
a
separate
issue
below
which
the
court
did
not
reach
about
whether
the
arbitration
clause
itself
had
been
improperly
imposed.
but
the
question
before
the
court
has
to
do
with
the
class
action
waiver,
which
this
court
in
concepcion
said
there's
no
statutory
basis
for
the
courts
to
preclude
application
of
that
waiver.
it's
also
--
would
create
a
completely
unworkable
inquiry
at
the
outset
of
litigation
in
order
to
determine
whether
to
refer
a
case
to
arbitration
in
the
first
place,
and
it's
unnecessary
because
state
law,
unconscionability,
can
deal
with
contracts
of
adhesion
or
unfair
terms.
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance
can
deal
with
how
to
cost
effectively
arbitrate
the
claims
in
issue.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
your
honor,
we
took
the
position
even
in
district
court
that
they
could
pool
their
resources--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--and
share
the
cost
of
the
claim.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
that's
--
that's
not
actually
correct.
we
did
not
say
that
we're
going
to
relieve
them
of
their
burden
of
proof
on
any
issues,
but
we
did
say,
and
the
district
court
agreed
with
us,
that
the
arbitrators
are
capable
of
dealing
with
these
claims
in
an
efficient
and
cost-effective
way
that
would
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
bring
them.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
we
could.
and
indeed--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--correct.
that
--
that
very
issue
was
present
in
the
eisen
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
our
position
is
that
multiple
claimants
in
arbitration
could
share
the
costs
of
an
expert
for
preparation
of
a
report.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
--
no
problem
with
that,
and
that's
absolutely
right.
but
the
plaintiffs
below
said
that
wasn't
good
enough.
they
said,
we
need
the
aggregate
damages
provided
in
a
class
action
to
make
this
worthwhile,
because
if
we're
just
going
to
essentially
get
costs--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
or
from
a
hedge
fund,
which
increasingly
finances
litigation.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
absolutely
right.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
and
that's
why
this
case
is
about
the
class
action
waiver.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
is
unclear.
i
have
tried
to
look
at
that
issue.
you
know,
even
in
court,
non-mutual
use
of
offensive
collateral
estoppel
is
sometimes
at
the
discretion
of
court.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
couldn't
find
anything
in
the
arbitration
contract.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
if
you
look
at
actually
the
affidavit
put
in
by
the
plaintiff's
expert
and
you
look
at
all
the
things
he
says
i
need
to
study
in
my
report,
they're
all
issues
in
common.
they're
not
specific
to
a--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
second
circuit
did
say
that
after
we
suggested
that
they
could
pool
resources.
and
we
think
that
was
an
indication
of
the
court's,
shall
we
say,
urgency
to
strike
down
the
class
action
waiver.
nobody
challenged
the
confidentiality
provision
below.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
would
not
apply.
we
took
that
position
below.
if
i
might
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
focus
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
below.
at
3a
of
our
appendix,
the
court
said:
"the
only
issue
before
us
is
the
narrow
question
of
whether
the
class
action
waiver
provision
contained
in
the
contract
between
the
parties
should
be
enforced.
"
that
is
the
question
on
which
we
sought
certiorari.
that
is
the
question
that
the
court
granted.
it
is
respondents
who
have
now
tried
to
rewrite
that
question
by
talking
about
other
possible
ways
of
vindicating
their
rights
that
they
claim
are
foreclosed,
that
they
claim
wrongly
are
foreclosed
by
the
contract
at
issue
here.
this
is
not--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
don't
think
you
need
a
factual
record,
because
respondents
acknowledge
the
burden
is
on
them
to
show
that
the
arbitration-specific
costs
would
preclude
them
from
pursuing
their
claim.
and
they
have
not
done
that
by
putting
in
an
affidavit
saying,
well,
in
litigation
we
have
to
do
--
get
5
million
documents
and
spend
$300,000
prosecuting
them
and
get
an
expert
report
which
could
cost
up
to
$1
million.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
is
not--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
the
court
could
certainly--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
arbitration
agreement
cannot
be
enforced
because
it
has
a
class
action
waiver.
that
is
clearly
reversible
error.
i
don't
even
hear--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--but
the
court
also
in
concepcion
said
you
can
condition
the
enforceability
of
an
arbitration
agreement
on
the
availability
of
class
procedures,
and
that
is
what
the
court
below
violated.
so
the
decision
below
has
to
be
vacated.
i
do
not
think
you
should
remand
for
a
detailed
factual
showing
on
just
how
they
are
going
to
vindicate
their
rights
in
arbitration,
because
most
of
those
questions,
what
evidence
is
required,
et
cetera,
are
for
the
arbitrator
in
the
first
instance.
that
said,
we
made
--
we
did
respond
to
their
showing
below.
we
did
not
put
in
a
dueling
affidavit
saying,
no,
in
litigation,
it
only
requires
a
$200,000
report
or
a
$25,000
report.
we
said,
that's
irrelevant,
because
we're
talking
about
arbitration-specific
costs.
and
there's
lots
of
ways
that
they
can
proceed
with
their
claims.
one
is
by
sharing
the
costs
of
an
expert,
and
they
specifically
rejected
that.
they
said,
even
if
we
could
shift
the
costs
of
the
experts
to
the
other
side,
that
wouldn't
be
good
enough,
because
then
all
we'd
be
doing
is
expending
much
money
to
get
it
back.
we
need
aggregated
damages
of
the
sort
available
in
class
suit--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that
is
how
i
read
--
that
is
how
i
read
the
report.
and
certainly
with
an
expert
arbitrator--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
we
raised
--
we've
argued
that
all
along.
in
fact,
i
can
refer
the
court
to
page
27
of
our
--
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--we
did,
in
fact.
but
let
me
answer
justice
breyer's
question
first,
at
page
27
of
our
court
of
appeals--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--we
specifically
said,
"the
declaration
of
merchant's
expert
is
similarly
un-illuminating,
as
he
too
studiously
avoided
projecting
the
costs
for
an
individual
arbitration
of
these
disputes.
"
so
we
did
argue
against
that
point.
this
is
not
an
exculpatory
clause.
the
court
has
made
clear
that
a
class
action
waiver
is
not
an
exculpatory
clause.
this
court
has
also
made
clear
that
you
cannot
assume
that
the
arbitral
forum
will
be
inadequate
to
vindicate
federal
substantive
rights.
and
they
cannot
now
change
the
nature
of
the
question
presented
by
arguing
that
well,
there
should
have
been
another
provision
to
allow
--
specifically
allow
cost-sharing,
or
specifically
allow
cost-shifting.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
--
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
the
premise
on
which
the
court
accepted
the
case,
presumably,
is
that
the
decision
below
which
conditioned
the
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
agreement
on
a
--
on
the
availability
of
class
procedures,
was
wrong
under
concepcion.
therefore--
