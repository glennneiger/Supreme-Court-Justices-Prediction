justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kellogg,
do
you
think
that
if
in
your
arbitration
agreement
you
had
a
clause
which
just
said,
i
hereby
agree
not
to
bring
any
sherman
act
claim
against
american
express,
could
--
could
your
arbitration
agreement
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
it
--
it
couldn't,
right,
because
we
would
say
no,
there
has
to
be
an
--
an
opportunity
for
a
vindication
of
statutory
rights;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
suppose
that
the
arbitration
clause
said
something
different.
suppose
that
the
arbitration
clause
said,
i
--
i
hereby
agree
that
i
will
not
present
any
economic
evidence
in
an
antitrust
action
against
american
express.
could
it
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
even
putting
aside
state
unconscionability
principles,
wouldn't
you
think
that
our
mitsubishi
case
and
our
randolph
case
would
again
come
in
and
say,
my
gosh,
this
arbitration
clause
prevents
any
effective
vindication
of
the
rights
to
bring
an
antitrust
suit.
wouldn't
you
say
that?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
think
--
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
elena
kagan
so
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
answer,
which
is
that
you
read
mitsubishi
and
randolph
as
so
narrow
that
you
would
say
that
the
principle
that
they
embody
does
not
prevent
american
express
from
saying,
you
cannot
produce
--
you
cannot
use
any
economic
expert
or
any
economic
testimony
in
an
antitrust
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
my
--
my
question
is
not
about
class
procedures,
it's
about
allowing
economic
evidence
to
help
prove
your
claim.
and
you
said,
no
problem,
even
though
it
is,
of
course,
true
in
the
real
world
that
to
prove
a
successful
antitrust
claim,
you
need
economic
evidence.
justice
elena
kagan
and
you
said
that's
fine,
because
you're
going
to
read
mitsubishi
and
randolph
in
such
a
way
that
it
allows
an
arbitration
clause
to
100
percent
effectively
absolutely
frustrate
your
ability
to
bring
a
sherman
act
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
think
--
i
think
what
they
are
saying
is
something
a
little
bit
different,
which
is
that
if
you
go
--
if
you
accept
my
premise
that
the
arbitration
clause
could
not
say
no
economic
evidence,
what
the
respondents
here
are
saying
is,
well,
now
you
have
to
give
us
the
ability
to
produce
economic
evidence
and
maybe
that
involves
class
procedures,
maybe
it
involves
something
else.
it
could
involve
some
other
cost-sharing
mechanism.
but
if
the
arbitration
clause
works
to
prevent
us
from
sharing
costs
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
produce
that
evidence,
then
once
again
we
have
a
problem
about
completely
frustrating
the
effect
of
the
sherman
act.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kellogg,
are
you
suggesting
that
you
can
win
an
antitrust
suit
in
arbitration
without
presenting
economic
evidence
of
such
things
as
monopoly
power,
antitrust
injury,
damages?
how
could
somebody
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
kellogg,
could
i
go
back
to
justice
alito's
point,
because
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understood
your
--
your
answer
to
it.
essentially,
the
claim
here,
right,
is
that
this
is
a
party
with
a
monopolistic
power
such
that
--
and
this
is
just
the
plaintiff's
allegation,
it
may
or
may
not
be
true,
but
--
but
they
say
that
american
express
is
using
its
market
power
to
impose
particular
contract
terms.
and
they
have
a
tying
thing,
but
it
could
just
as
easily
be
the
case
that
american
express
could
be
using
its
economic
power
to
impose
terms
essentially
making
arbitration
of
antitrust
claims
impossible.
and
why
shouldn't
we
understand
this
problem
as
connected
to
the
very
allegation
that's
being
brought?
that,
you
know,
how
is
it,
how
is
it
going
to
be
possible
in
a
case
where
there's
a
monopoly
power
able
--
able
to
impose
contracts
terms
that
--
that
you
can
create
an
arbitration
clause
which
essentially
prevents
that
from
being
challenged?
justice
elena
kagan
and,
mr.
kellogg--
justice
elena
kagan
--just
to
be
sure
i
understand
it,
that
you're
saying
that
it
does
not
violate
the
confidentiality
agreement
of
this
clause
to
--
to
all
get
together
and
produce
one
report?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
justice
elena
kagan
and
did
--
did
you
say
that
below
as
well,
that
--
that
the
confidentiality
clause
does
not
sweep
so
widely
as
to
prevent
this?
because
clearly,
the
court
below
thought
that
the
confidentiality
clause
did
sweep
so
widely
as
to
prevent
this.
justice
elena
kagan
so
but
you're
saying
the
confidentiality
position
would
not
apply
in
that
circumstance.
justice
elena
kagan
and,
mr.
--
mr.
stewart,
isn't
that
also
consistent
with
the
way
the
court
addressed
the
issue
in
randolph?
because
what
the
court
said
there
was
it
might
be
that
these
arbitration
fees
are
prohibitive.
and
if
those
arbitration
fees
are
prohibitive,
then
this
doctrine
kicks
in.
and
it
didn't
look
to
say,
well,
let's
compare
how
these
fees
relate
to
whatever
costs
you
would
wind
up
with
in
litigation.
it
just
said,
if
the
arbitration
fees
are
prohibitive
in
such
--
in
such
a
manner
that
it
prevents
you
from
vindicating
your
federal
claim
in
arbitration,
that's
enough.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
kellogg,
it
does
seem
like
both
of
the
parties
have
changed
what
they're
saying
a
bit.
and,
you
know,
if
this
case
as
presented
to
us
was
presented
to
us
in
the
first
instance
that
the
premise
was
that
if
you
go
into
arbitration,
it
would
not
provide
an
effective
way
to
vindicate
the
claim.
and,
now,
people
are
saying
different
things
about
the
confidentiality
clause,
and
people
may
be
saying
different
things
about
the
necessity
of
an
expert.
it
suggests
that
the
premise
on
which
this
case
was
presented
to
us
was
not
quite
right.
