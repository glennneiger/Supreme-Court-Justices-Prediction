mr.
kellogg,
suppose
it
goes
to
arbitration
as
you
think
it
should,
and
the
arbitrator
says
to
the
merchant,
to
prove
your
case,
you
have
to
show
the
relevant
market,
you
have
to
show
that
american
express
has
market
power,
that
it
used
that
power
to
the
detriment
of
its
competitors,
and
the
way
these
sections
--
the
way
these
kinds
of
cases
have
gone
is
to
get
an
expert.
and
i
don't
see
that
you
can
prove
it
in
--
in
a
new
way.
i
mean,
the
whole
point
of
this
is
that
the
expense
to
win
one
of
these
cases
is
enormous.
and
no
single
person
is
worth
that
person's
while.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
--
i
missed
that.
the
sharing
of
the
costs,
how
does
that
work?
it's
certainly
not
in
the
agreement,
not
in
the
arbitration
agreement,
that
--
that
american
express
is
going
to
pay
for
the
expert
for
the
other
side.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
what
you
would
you
have,
five,
six
different
arbitrations
going,
and
in
each
of
those
five
or
six
cases,
you
would
have
--
they
could
share?
they
could
share
the
million
dollar
cost
of
this
--
the
experts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
--
i'm
sorry,
but
i
don't
think
i
got
the
answer
to
my
question.
the
--
the
arbitrator
has
now
said
we
have
to
have
an
expert,
and
the
plaintiff
says
--
or
the
complainant
says,
i
haven't
got
the
wherewithal,
and
if
i
have
six
friends
who
bring
individual
arbitrations,
that's
not
nearly
enough.
so
what
happens
then,
the
case
ends,
and
it's
not
possible--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
the
only
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
is,
you
have
to
pay
300,000
minimum
for
the
expert,
the
most
you
can
get
in
treble
damages
is
5,000.
it
didn't
go
into
all
the
other
things
that
you
were
saying.
it
said
nobody
in
his
right
mind
will
bring
such
a
lawsuit
to
pay
$300,000
to
get
$5,000.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
at&t
mobility
case,
the
court
remarked
that
this
was
a
--
that
the
arbitration
agreement
had
certain
provisions
that
made
it
easier
for
the
consumer
to
use
the
arbitral
forum.
is
there
anything
like
that
in
this
arbitration
clause?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
where
not
some
other
consumer
in
another
arbitration,
not
that
sharing
of
the
costs,
but
wasn't
at&t
mobility
going
to
pick
up
a
good
part
of
the
tab
of
the
cost
of
the
arbitration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
--
did
american
express
say,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
that,
well,
we
will
concede
a,
b,
and
c,
so
the
only
issue
on
which
you
need
proof
is
d?
as
i
understood
it,
american
express
never
took
the
position
that
it
would
--
it
would
concede
certain
issues
so
that
you
could
limit
the
proof.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i'm
not
talking
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
not
talking
about
pooling
with
other
single
merchants
bringing
single
arbitrations.
i'm
asking
whether
american
express
--
so
here's
the
complaint.
it
says,
i
have
to
prove
relevant
lawsuits
separately.
and
did
american
express
take
the
position,
no,
you
don't
have
to
prove
all
that.
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer
was
suggesting.
there's
only
one
thing
that's
really
in
controversy
and
the
rest
we
could
stipulate.
but
i
didn't
see
anything
in
all
the
time
this
case
has
been
in
the
courts
on
american
express's
part
to
that
say
that
we
are
not
going
to
demand
the
full
breadth
of
proof.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
is
it
--
the
arbitration
agreement
is
a
one-on-one,
right?
they
can't,
or
can
they
have
--
they
have
the
12
similarly
situated
people,
not
a
class,
showing
in
the
arbitration,
or
is
it
one
on
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
even
in
the
days
before
we
had
rule
23,
when
you
were
bringing
a
suit
in
federal
court
you
could
have
multiple
plaintiffs
joining
together.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
because
--
it
was
because
judge
pooler
said:
"i
have
been
instructed
by
the
supreme
court
that
i
may
not
require
class
arbitration.
"
that's
--
and
she
was
bound
by
our
decision
that
a
court
can't
order
class
arbitration;
isn't
that
correct?
so
that
was
not
an
option
for
her.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
second
circuit
never
said
anything
about,
this
is
what
it
would
cost
in
court.
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
said,
this
is
what
it
would
cost
to
prove
this
kind
of
tying,
right?
it
didn't
say
one
word
distinguishing
what
it
would
cost
in
litigation
from
what
it
would
cost
in
arbitration.
it
was
simply
what
it
was
going
to
cost.
