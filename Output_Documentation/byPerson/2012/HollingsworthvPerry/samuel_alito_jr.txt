justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
mr.
olson,
is
it
your
position
that
the
only
people
who
could
defend
a
ballot,
a
law
that's
adopted
in
california
through
the
ballot
initiative
are
the
attorney
general
and
the
governor,
so
that
if
the
attorney
general
and
the
governor
don't
like
the
ballot
initiative,
it
will
go
undefended?
is
that
your
position?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
states
are
not
bound
by
the
same
separation
of
powers
doctrine
that
underlies
the
federal
constitution.
you
couldn't
have
a
federal
initiative,
for
example.
they're
free
of
all
that.
so
start
from
the
proposition
that
a
state
has
standing
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
law
un
--
beyond
dispute.
the
question
then
is,
who
represents
the
state?
now,
in
a
state
that
has
initiative,
the
whole
process
would
be
defeated
if
the
only
people
who
could
defend
the
statute
are
the
elected
public
officials.
the
whole
point
--
you
know
this
better
than
i
do,
because
you're
from
california
--
the
whole
point
of
the
initiative
process
was
to
allow
the
people
to
circumvent
public
officials
about
whom
they
were
suspicious.
so
if
you
reject
that
proposition,
what
is
left
is
the
proposition
that
the
state
--
state
law
can
choose
some
other
person,
some
other
group
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
law.
and
the
california
supreme
court
has
told
us
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
precisely
those
people.
so
how
do
you
get
around
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
seriously,
mr.
olson,
if
california
provides
all
the
substantive
benefits
of
marriage
to
same-sex
domestic
partnerships,
are
you
seriously
arguing
that
if
california
--
if
the
state
--
if
the
case
before
us
now
were
from
a
state
that
doesn't
provide
any
of
those
benefits
to
same-sex
couples,
this
case
would
come
out
differently?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
either
this
case
is
the
same,
this
would
be
the
same
if
this
were
utah
or
oklahoma,
or
it's
different
because
it's
california
and
california
has
provided
all
these--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
tomorrow
you're
going
to
be
making
a
standing
argument
that
some
parties
think
is
rather
tenuous,
but
today,
you're
--
you're
very
strong
for
article
iii
standing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
none
of
the--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--you
want
us
to
assess
the
effects
of
same-sex
marriage,
the
potential
effects
on
--
of
same-sex
marriage,
the
potential
--
the
effects
of
proposition
8.
but
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
which
has
already
been
mentioned
about
the
need
to
be
cautious
in
light
of
the
newness
of
the
--
the
concept
of
--
of
same-sex
marriage.
the
one
thing
that
the
parties
in
this
case
seem
to
agree
on
is
that
marriage
is
very
important.
it's
thought
to
be
a
fundamental
building
block
of
society
and
its
preservation
essential
for
the
preservation
of
society.
traditional
marriage
has
been
around
for
thousands
of
years.
same-sex
marriage
is
very
new.
i
think
it
was
first
adopted
in
the
netherlands
in
2000.
so
there
isn't
a
lot
of
data
about
its
effect.
and
it
may
turn
out
to
be
a
--
a
good
thing;
it
may
turn
out
not
to
be
a
good
thing,
as
the
supporters
of
proposition
8
apparently
believe.
but
you
want
us
to
step
in
and
render
a
decision
based
on
an
assessment
of
the
effects
of
this
institution
which
is
newer
than
cell
phones
or
the
internet?
i
mean
we
--
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
have
the
ability
to
see
the
future.
on
a
question
like
that,
of
such
fundamental
importance,
why
should
it
not
be
left
for
the
people,
either
acting
through
initiatives
and
referendums
or
through
their
elected
public
officials?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
just
in
response
to
that,
of
course
the
constitution
could
be
amended,
and
--
and
i
think
i
read
that
the
california
constitution
has
been
amended
500
times.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it's
not
exactly
like
the
u.s.
constitution.
