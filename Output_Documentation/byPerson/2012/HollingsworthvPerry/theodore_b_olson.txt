mr.
theodore
b.
olson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
know
that
you
will
want
me
to
spend
a
moment
or
two
addressing
the
standing
question,
but
before
i
do
that,
i
thought
that
it
would
be
important
for
this
court
to
have
proposition
8
put
in
context,
what
it
does.
it
walls-off
gays
and
lesbians
from
marriage,
the
most
important
relation
in
life,
according
to
this
court,
thus
stigmatizing
a
class
of
californians
based
upon
their
status
and
labeling
their
most
cherished
relationships
as
second-rate,
different,
unequal,
and
not
okay.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
was
trying
to
avoid
that,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
yes.
i
think
that
our
jurisdictional
argument
is,
as
we
set
forth
in
the
brief,
california
cannot
create
article
iii
standing
by
designating
whoever
it
wants
to
defend
the
state
of
california
in
connection
with
the
ballot.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
the
--
that's
the
way
the
california
supreme
court
saw
it
with
respect
to
california
law.
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
of
california
are
elected
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
state
of
california.
they
made
a
professional
judgment
given
their
obligations
as
officers
of
the
state
of
california.
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
that
proponents
--
and
by
the
way,
only
four
of
the
five
are
here.
dr.
tam
withdrew
from
the
case
because
of
some
--
many
things
he
said
during
the
election
campaign.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that
limited.
i
think
one
of
your
colleagues
suggested
that
there
could
be
an
officer
appointed.
there
could
be
an
appointee
of
the
state
of
california
who
had
responsibility,
fiduciary
responsibility
to
the
state
of
california
and
the
citizens
of
california,
to
represent
the
state
of
california
along--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
that
happens
all
the
time.
as
you
recall
in
the
case
of
--
well,
let's
not
spend
too
much
time
on
independent
counsel
provisions,
but
----
[laughter]
the
governor
--
the
government
of
the
state
of
california
frequently
appoints
an
attorney
where
there's
a
perceived
conflict
of
interest--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
that
person
would
have
a
responsibility
for
the
state
and
might
have
responsibility
for
the
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
might
well
be
in
--
in
a
different
case.
i
don't
know
about
this
case.
if
there
was,
for
example,
this
was
an
initiative
measure
that
allocated
certain
resources
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
people
--
maybe
it
was
a
binary
system
of
people
got
resources
and
other
people
didn't
get
resources,
there
could
be
standing.
someone
would
show
actual
injury.
the
point,
i
guess,
at
the
bottom
of
this
is
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
decided
in
raines
v.
byrd
that
congress
couldn't
specify
members
of
congress
in
that
context
even
where
the
measure
depleted
or
diminished
powers
of
congress--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
only
--
that's
exactly
what
the
california
supreme
court
thought.
the
california
supreme
court
thought
that
it
could
decide
that
the
proponents,
whoever
they
were,
and
this
could
be
25
years
after
the
election;
it
could
be
one
of
the
proponents,
it
could
be
four
of
the
proponents;
they
could
have
an
interest
other
than
the
state
because
they
have
no
fiduciary
responsibility
to
the
state;
they
may
be
incurring
attorneys'
fees
on
behalf
of
the
state
or
on
behalf
of
themselves,
but
they
haven't
been
appointed;
they
have
no
official
responsibility
to
the
state.
and
my
only
argument,
and
i
know
it's
a
close
one,
because
california
thinks
that
this
is
the
system.
the
california
supreme
court
thought
that
this
was
a
system
that
would
be
a
default
system.
i'm
suggesting
from
your
decisions
with
respect
to
article
iii
that
that
takes
more
than
that
under--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
don't
have
an
answer
to
that
question
unless
there's
an
appointment
process
either
built
into
the
system
where
it's
an
officer
of
california
or--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
that's
the
argument--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that's
our
--
that's
the
argument
our
opponents
make.
but
it
--
but
it
must
be
said
that
it
happens
all
of
the
time,
that
federal
officials
and
state
officials
decide
not
to
enforce
a
statute,
to
enforce
a
statute
in
certain
ways.
we
don't
then
come
in
and
decide
that
there's
someone
else
ought
to
be
in
court
for
every
particular--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yeah,
i
don't--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is
--
what
is
missing
here,
because
you're
not
an
officer
of
the
state
of
california,
you
don't
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
the
state
of
california,
you're
not
bound
by
the
ethical
standards
of
an
officer
of
the
state
of
california
to
represent
the
state
of
california,
you
could
have
conflicts
of
interest.
and
as
i
said,
you'd
be
--
could
be
incurring
enormous
legal
fees
on
behalf
of
the
state
when
the
state
hasn't
decided
to
go
that
route.
i
think--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--thank
you,
your
honor.
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
--
at
the
outset,
this
is
a
measure
that
walls
off
the
institution
of
marriage,
which
is
not
society's
right.
it's
an
individual
right
that
this
court
again
and
again
and
again
has
said
the
right
to
get
married,
the
right
to
have
the
relationship
of
marriage
is
a
personal
right.
it's
a
part
of
the
right
of
privacy,
association,
liberty,
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness.
in
the
cases
in
which
you've
described
the
right
to
get
married
under
the
constitution,
you've
described
it
as
marriage,
procreation,
family,
other
things
like
that.
so
the
procreation
aspect,
the
responsibility
or
ability
or
interest
in
procreation
is
not
a
part
of
the
right
to
get
married.
now,
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there's
a
couple
of
answers
to
that,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
case,
that
decision
to
exclude
gays
and
lesbians
was
made
by
the
state
of
california.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
california
supreme
court,
like
this
supreme
court,
decides
what
the
law
is.
the
california
supreme
court
decided
that
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
that
california
constitution
did
not
permit
excluding
gays
and
lesbians
from
the
right
to
get
married--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--when
--
may
i
answer
this
in
the
form
of
a
rhetorical
question?
when
did
it
become
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
interracial
marriages?
when
did
it
become
unconstitutional
to
assign
children
to
separate
schools.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
when
the
--
when
the
california
supreme
court
faced
the
decision,
which
it
had
never
faced
before,
is
--
does
excluding
gay
and
lesbian
citizens,
who
are
a
class
based
upon
their
status
as
homosexuals
--
is
it
--
is
it
constitutional--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--that
--
they
did
not
assign
a
date
to
it,
justice
scalia,
as
you
know.
what
the
court
decided
was
the
case
that
came
before
it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
was
constitutional
when
we
--
as
a
culture
determined
that
sexual
orientation
is
a
characteristic
of
individuals
that
they
cannot
control,
and
that
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there's
no
specific
date
in
time.
this
is
an
evolutionary
cycle.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
the
case
that's
before
you--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--in
--
the
case
that's
before
you
today,
california
decided
--
the
citizens
of
california
decided,
after
the
california
supreme
court
decided
that
individuals
had
a
right
to
get
married
irrespective
of
their
sexual
orientation
in
california,
and
then
the
californians
decided
in
proposition
8,
wait
a
minute,
we
don't
want
those
people
to
be
able
to
get
married.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
would
make
--
i
would
make
the
--
also
would
make
the
--
that
distinguishes
it
in
one
respect.
but
also
--
also
--
i
would
also
make
the
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
are
--
this
--
marriage
is
a
fundamental
right
and
we
are
making
a
classification
based
upon
a
status
of
individuals,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
decided
that
gays
and
lesbians
are
defined
by
their
status.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
we
do,
we
submit
that.
you
could
write
a
narrower
decision.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
don't
--
when
--
it
seems
to
me,
justice
scalia,
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
--
i
submit
you've
never
required
that
before.
when
you
decided
that
--
that
individuals
--
after
having
decided
that
separate
but
equal
schools
were
permissible,
a
decision
by
this
court,
when
you
decided
that
that
was
unconstitutional,
when
did
that
become
unconstitutional?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
--
i
can't
answer
that
question,
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
phrased
the
question
in
that
way.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
what
i
have
before
you
now,
the
case
that's
before
you
today,
is
whether
or
not
california
can
take
a
class
of
individuals
based
upon
their
characteristics,
their
distinguishing
characteristics,
remove
from
them
the
right
of
privacy,
liberty,
association,
spirituality,
and
identity
that
--
that
marriage
gives
them.
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
not
an
answer
to
say
procreation
or
anything
of
that
nature,
because
procreation
is
not
a
part
of
the
right
to
get
married.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
this
court
has
always
looked
into
the
context.
in,
for
example,
the
new
orleans
case
involving
the
gambling
casinos
and
advertising,
you
look
at
the
context
of
what
was
permitted,
what
was
not
permitted,
and
does
that
rationalization
for
prohibiting
in
that
case
the
advertising,
in
this
case
prohibiting
the
relationship
of
marriage,
does
it
make
any
sense
in
the
context
of
what
exists?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
come
out
differently,
because
of
the
fundamental
arguments
we're
making
with
respect
to
class-based
distinctions
with
respect
to
a
fundamental
right.
however,
to
the
extent
that
my
opponent,
in
the
context
of
california,
talks
about
child-rearing
or
adoptions
or
--
or
of
rights
of
people
to
live
together
and
that
sort
of
thing,
those
arguments
can't
be
made
on
behalf
of
california,
because
california's
already
made
a
decision
that
gay
and
lesbian
individuals
are
perfectly
suitable
as
parents,
they're
perfectly
suitable
to
adopt,
they're
raising
37,000
children
in
california,
and
the
expert
on
the
other
side
specifically
said
and
testified
that
they
would
be
better
off
when
their
parents
were
allowed
to
get
married.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
--
i
think
that
it's
not
that
we're
arguing
that
those
are
inconsistent.
if
the
fundamental
thing
is
that
denying
gays
and
lesbians
the
right
of
marriage,
which
is
fundamental
under
your
decisions,
that
is
unconstitutional,
if
it
is
--
if
the
state
comes
forth
with
certain
arguments
--
utah
might
come
forth
with
certain
justifications.
california
might
come
forth
with
others.
but
the
fact
is
that
california
can't
make
the
arguments
about
adoption
or
child-rearing
or
people
living
together,
because
they
have
already
made
policy
decisions.
so
that
doesn't
make
them
inconsistent.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
the
label
is--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
label
“
marriage
”
means
something.
even
our
opponents--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
is
like
you
were
to
say
you
can
vote,
you
can
travel,
but
you
may
not
be
a
citizen.
there
are
certain
labels
in
this
country
that
are
very,
very
critical.
you
could
have
said
in
the
loving
case,
what
--
you
can't
get
married,
but
you
can
have
an
interracial
union.
everyone
would
know
that
that
was
wrong,
that
the
--
marriage
has
a
status,
recognition,
support,
and
you
--
if
you
read
the
test,
you
know--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
you
have
said
that
marriage
is
a
fundamental
right
with
respect
to
procreation
and
at
the
same
level
getting
married,
privacy
--
you
said
that
in
the
zablocki
case,
you
said
that
in
the
lawrence
case,
and
you
said
it
in
other
cases,
the
skinner
case,
for
example.
marriage
is
put
on
a
pro
--
equal
footing
with
procreational
aspects.
and
your
--
this
court
is
the
one
that
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
marriage
means
something
to
the
individual:
the
privacy,
intimacy,
and
that
it
is
a
matter
of
status
and
recognition
in
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
you've
said
--
you've
said
in
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
that
the
polygamy
issue,
multiple
marriages
raises
questions
about
exploitation,
abuse,
patriarchy,
issues
with
respect
to
taxes,
inheritance,
child
custody,
it
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
and
if
you
--
if
a
state
prohibits
polygamy,
it's
prohibiting
conduct.
if
it
prohibits
gay
and
lesbian
citizens
from
getting
married,
it
is
prohibiting
their
exercise
of
a
right
based
upon
their
status.
it's
selecting
them
as
a
class,
as
you
described
in
the
romer
case
and
as
you
described
in
the
lawrence
case
and
in
other
cases,
you're
picking
out
a
group
of
individuals
to
deny
them
the
freedom
that
you've
said
is
fundamental,
important
and
vital
in
this
society,
and
it
has
status
and
stature,
as
you
pointed
out
in
the
vmi
case.
there's
a
--
there's
a
different--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
the
ninth
circuit
did
that.
you
can
decide
the
standing
case
that
limits
it
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court
here.
you
could
decide
it
as
the
ninth
circuit
did--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--oh,
the
case
was
certainly
properly
granted,
your
honor.
i
mean,
there
was
a
full
trial
of
all
of
these
issues.
there
was
a
12-day
trial,
the
judge
insisted
on
evidence
on
all
of
these
questions.
this
--
this
is
a--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
issue
--
yes,
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
it
and
decided
because
of
your
decision
on
the
romer
case,
this
court's
decision
on
the
romer
case,
that
it
could
be
decided
on
the
narrower
issue,
but
it
certainly
was
an
appropriate
case
to
grant.
and
those
issues
that
i've
been
describing
are
certainly
fundamental
to
the
case.
and
--
and
i
don't
want
to
abuse
the
court's
indulgence,
that
what
i
--
you
suggested
that
this
is
uncharted
waters.
it
was
uncharted
waters
when
this
court,
in
1967,
in
the
loving
decision
said
that
interracial
--
prohibitions
on
interracial
marriages,
which
still
existed
in
16
states,
were
unconstitutional.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
and
--
and
what
we
have
here--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
--
i
respectfully
submit
that
we've
under
--
we've
learned
to
understand
more
about
sexual
orientation
and
what
it
means
to
individuals.
i
guess
the
--
the
language
that
justice
ginsburg
used
at
the
closing
of
the
vmi
case
is
an
important
thing,
it
resonates
with
me,
"a
prime
part
of
the
history
of
our
constitution
is
the
story
of
the
extension
of
constitutional
rights
to
people
once
ignored
or
excluded.
"
