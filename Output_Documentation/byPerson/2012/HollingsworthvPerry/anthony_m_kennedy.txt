justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
chief
--
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kagan
have
given
a
proper
hypothetical
to
test
your
theory.
but
in
this
case
the
proponents,
number
one,
must
give
their
official
address,
they
must
pay
money,
and
they
must
all
act
in
unison
under
california
law.
so
these
five
proponents
were
required
at
all
times
to
act
in
unison,
so
that
distinguishes
--
and
to
register
and
to
pay
money
for
the
--
so
in
that
sense
it's
different
from
simply
saying
any
citizen.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
believe
this
can
be
treated
as
a
gender-based
classification?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
difficult
question
that
i've
been
trying
to
wrestle
with
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
are
--
are
you
conceding
the
point
that
there
is
no
harm
or
denigration
to
traditional
opposite-sex
marriage
couples?
so
you're
conceding
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but,
then
it
--
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
have
to
address
justice
kagan's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
think
there's
--
there's
substantial
--
that
there's
substance
to
the
point
that
sociological
information
is
new.
we
have
five
years
of
information
to
weigh
against
2,000
years
of
history
or
more.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
an
immediate
legal
injury
or
legal
--
what
could
be
a
legal
injury,
and
that's
the
voice
of
these
children.
there
are
some
40,000
children
in
california,
according
to
the
red
brief,
that
live
with
same-sex
parents,
and
they
want
their
parents
to
have
full
recognition
and
full
status.
the
voice
of
those
children
is
important
in
this
case,
don't
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
is
not
whoever
it
wants.
these
are
five
proponents
of
--
of
the
measure,
and
if
we
were
to
accept
your
argument,
it
would
give
the
state
a
one-way
ratchet.
the
state
could
go
in
and
make
a
defense,
maybe
a
half-hearted
defense
of
the
statute,
and
--
and
then
when
the
statute
is
held
invalid,
simply
--
simply
leave.
on
the
other
hand,
if
--
if
the
state
loses,
the
state
can
appeal.
so
this
is
a
one-way
ratchet
as
it
favors
the
state,
and
allows
governors
and
other
constitutional
officers
in
different
states
to
thwart
the
initiative
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
really
--
that's
a
broad
argument
that
you
--
that's
in
this
case
if
the
court
wants
to
reach
it.
the
rationale
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
much
more
narrow.
it
basically
said
that
california,
which
has
been
more
generous,
more
open
to
protecting
same-sex
couples
than
almost
any
state
in
the
union,
just
didn't
go
far
enough,
and
it's
being
penalized
for
not
going
far
enough.
that's
a
very
odd
rationale
on
which
to
sustain
this
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
problem
--
the
problem
with
the
case
is
that
you're
really
asking,
particularly
because
of
the
sociological
evidence
you
cite,
for
us
to
go
into
uncharted
waters,
and
you
can
play
with
that
metaphor,
there's
a
wonderful
destination,
it
is
a
cliff.
whatever
that
was.
[laughter]
but
you're
--
you're
doing
so
in
a
--
in
a
case
where
the
opinion
is
very
narrow.
basically
that
once
the
state
goes
halfway,
it
has
to
go
all
the
way
or
70
percent
of
the
way,
and
you're
doing
so
in
a
case
where
there's
a
substantial
question
on
--
on
standing.
i
just
wonder
if
--
if
the
case
was
properly
granted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
not
the
issue
the
ninth
circuit
decided.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
hundreds
of
years
old
in
the
common
law
countries.
this
was
new
to
the
united
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
that's
not
accurate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
might
address
why
you
think
we
should
take
and
decide
this
case.
