justice
elena
kagan
--could
--
could
the
state
assign
to
any
citizen
the
rights
to
defend
a
judgment
of
this
kind?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
just
--
if
you
would
on
the
hypothetical:
could
a
state
just
assign
to
anybody
the
ability
to
do
this?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
cooper,
could
i
just
understand
your
argument.
in
reading
the
briefs,
it
seems
as
though
your
principal
argument
is
that
same-sex
and
opposite
--
opposite-sex
couples
are
not
similarly
situated
because
opposite-sex
couples
can
procreate,
same-sex
couples
cannot,
and
the
state's
principal
interest
in
marriage
is
in
regulating
procreation.
is
that
basically
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
is
--
is
there
--
so
you
have
sort
of
a
reason
for
not
including
same-sex
couples.
is
there
any
reason
that
you
have
for
excluding
them?
in
other
words,
you're
saying,
well,
if
we
allow
same-sex
couples
to
marry,
it
doesn't
serve
the
state's
interest.
but
do
you
go
further
and
say
that
it
harms
any
state
interest?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
could
you
explain
that
a
little
bit
to
me,
just
because
i
did
not
pick
this
up
in
your
briefs.
what
harm
you
see
happening
and
when
and
how
and
--
what
--
what
harm
to
the
institution
of
marriage
or
to
opposite-sex
couples,
how
does
this
cause
and
effect
work?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose
a
state
said,
mr.
cooper,
suppose
a
state
said
that,
because
we
think
that
the
focus
of
marriage
really
should
be
on
procreation,
we
are
not
going
to
give
marriage
licenses
anymore
to
any
couple
where
both
people
are
over
the
age
of
55.
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
elena
kagan
because
that's
the
same
state
interest,
i
would
think,
you
know.
if
you
are
over
the
age
of
55,
you
don't
help
us
serve
the
government's
interest
in
regulating
procreation
through
marriage.
so
why
is
that
different?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
really,
because
if
the
couple
--
i
can
just
assure
you,
if
both
the
woman
and
the
man
are
over
the
age
of
55,
there
are
not
a
lot
of
children
coming
out
of
that
marriage.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
actually,
i'm
not
even--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
i
just
asked
about
age.
i
didn't
ask
about
anything
else.
that's
not
--
we
ask
about
people's
age
all
the
time.
justice
elena
kagan
a
couple
where
both
people
are
over
the
age
of
55--
justice
elena
kagan
--a
couple
where
both
people
are
over

age

55.
