justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
the
attorney
general
of
this
state
doesn't
have
any
proprietary
interest
either,
does
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
he
can
defend
it,
can't
he--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
the
law
says
he
can
defend
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cooper,
let
me
--
let
me
give
you
one
--
one
concrete
thing.
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
mention
some
concrete
things.
if
you
redefine
marriage
to
include
same-sex
couples,
you
must
--
you
must
permit
adoption
by
same-sex
couples,
and
there's
--
there's
considerable
disagreement
among
--
among
sociologists
as
to
what
the
consequences
of
raising
a
child
in
a
--
in
a
single-sex
family,
whether
that
is
harmful
to
the
child
or
not.
some
states
do
not
--
do
not
permit
adoption
by
same-sex
couples
for
that
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
we
know
the
answer
to
that.
do
you
know
the
answer
to
that,
whether
it
--
whether
it
harms
or
helps
the
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
possible
deleterious
effect,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
it's
true,
but
irrelevant.
they're
arguing
for
a
nationwide
rule
which
applies
to
states
other
than
california,
that
every
state
must
allow
marriage
by
same-sex
couples.
and
so
even
though
states
that
believe
it
is
harmful
--
and
i
take
no
position
on
whether
it's
harmful
or
not,
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
--
that
there's
no
scientific
answer
to
that
question
at
this
point
in
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
we
could
have
a
questionnaire
at
the
marriage
desk
when
people
come
in
to
get
the
marriage
--
you
know,
are
you
fertile
or
are
you
not
fertile?
[laughter]
i
suspect
this
court
would
hold
that
to
be
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
privacy,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
strom
thurmond
was
--
was
not
the
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
when
justice
kagan
was
confirmed.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
who
--
who
would
appoint
him?
the
same
governor
that
didn't
want
to
defend
the
plebiscite?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
--
you've
led
me
right
into
a
question
i
was
going
to
ask.
the
california
supreme
court
decides
what
the
law
is.
that's
what
we
decide,
right?
we
don't
prescribe
law
for
the
future.
we
--
we
decide
what
the
law
is.
i'm
curious,
when
--
when
did
--
when
did
it
become
unconstitutional
to
exclude
homosexual
couples
from
marriage?
1791?
1868,
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted?
sometimes
--
some
time
after
baker,
where
we
said
it
didn't
even
raise
a
substantial
federal
question?
when
--
when
--
when
did
the
law
become
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
easy
question,
i
think,
for
that
one.
at
--
at
the
time
that
the
equal
protection
clause
was
adopted.
that's
absolutely
true.
but
don't
give
me
a
question
to
my
question.
[laughter]
when
do
you
think
it
became
unconstitutional?
has
it
always
been
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that's
not
when
it
became
unconstitutional.
that's
when
they
acted
in
an
unconstitutional
matter
--
in
an
unconstitutional
matter.
when
did
it
become
unconstitutional
to
prohibit
gays
from
marrying?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
the
california
supreme
court.
i'm
talking
about
your
argument.
you
say
it
is
now
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
always
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
when
did
that
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
am
i
supposed
to
know
how
to
decide
a
case,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
can't
give
me
a
date
when
the
constitution
changes?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
would
be
unconstitutional
even
in
states
that
did
not
allow
civil
unions?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
i
want
to
know
how
long
it
has
been
unconstitutional
in
those--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
me
when.
otherwise,
i
don't
know
how
to
decide
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
50
years
ago,
it
was
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
either.
that's
the
problem.
that's
exactly
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
the
rest
of
the
country
has
been
cautious.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we're
--
and
you
are
asking
us
to
impose
this
on
the
whole
country,
not
just
california.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
--
your
position
is
only
if
a
state
allows
civil
unions
does
it
become
unconstitutional
to
forbid
same-sex
marriage,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
too
late
for
that,
too
late
for
that
now,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
we
granted
cert.--
i
mean,
that's
essentially
asking,
you
know,
why
did
we
grant
cert.
we
should
let
it
percolate
for
another
--
you
know,
we
--
we
have
crossed
that
river,
i
think.
