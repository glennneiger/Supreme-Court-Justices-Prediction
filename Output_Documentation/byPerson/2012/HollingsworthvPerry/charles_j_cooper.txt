mr.
charles
j.
cooper
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
new
york's
highest
court,
in
a
case
similar
to
this
one,
remarked
that
until
quite
recently,
it
was
an
accepted
truth
for
almost
everyone
who
ever
lived
in
any
society
in
which
marriage
existed--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i'd
be
happy
to,
mr.
chief
justice.
your
honor,
the
official
proponents
of
proposition
8,
the
initiative,
have
standing
to
defend
that
measure
before
this
court
as
representatives
of
the
people
and
the
state
of
california
to
defend
the
validity
of
a
measure
that
they
brought
forward.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no,
your
honor,
the
court
has
not
done
that.
but
the
court
has
never
had
before
it
a
clear
expression
from
a
unanimous
state's
high
court
that--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--they're
distinguishable,
your
honor,
because
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
california
and
its
election
code
provide,
according
to
the
unanimous
interpretation
of
the
california
supreme
court,
that
the
official
proponents,
in
addition
to
the
other
official
responsibilities
and
authorities
that
they
have
in
the
initiative
process,
that
those
official
proponents
also
have
the
authority
and
the
responsibility
to
defend
the
validity
of
that
initiative--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
your
honor,
nor
did--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--nor
did--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that's
right,
your
honor.
nor
did
the
legislative
leaders
in
the
karcher
case
have--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--any
particular
enforcement--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--justice
kagan,
that
would
be
a
--
a
very
tough
question.
it's
--
it's
by
no
means
the
question
before
the
court,
because
--
because
it
isn't
any
citizen,
it's
--
it
is
the
--
it
is
the
official
proponents
that
have
a
specific
and
--
and
carefully
detailed--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
think
it
very
well
might.
it
very
well
might
be
able
to
decide
that
any
citizen
could
step
forward
and
represent
the
interests
of
the
state
and
the
people
in
that
state--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
but,
your
honor,
i
guess
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
there
is
no
question
the
state
has
standing,
the
state
itself
has
standing
to
represent
its
own
interests
in
the
validity
of
its
own
enactments.
and
if
the
state's
public
officials
decline
to
do
that,
it
is
within
the
state's
authority
surely,
i
would
submit,
to
identify,
if
not
all
--
any
citizen
or
at
least
supporter
of
the
measure,
certainly
those,
that
that
very
clear
and
identifiable
group
of
citizens--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--but
of
course
it
is,
and
i
think
the
key--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
the
--
the
question
before
the
court,
i
would
submit,
is
not
the
injury
to
the
individual
proponents;
it's
the
injury
to
the
state.
the
--
the
legislators
in
the
karcher
case
had
no
individual
particularized
injury,
and
yet
this
court
recognized
they
were
proper
representatives
of
the
state's
interests,
the
state's
injury--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--true.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
the
attorney
general,
whether
it's
a
fiduciary
obligation
or
not,
is
in
normal
circumstances
the
representative
of
the
state
to
defend
the
validity
of
the
state's
enactments
when
they
are
challenged
in
federal
court.
but
when
that
officer
doesn't
do
so,
the
state
surely
has
every
authority
and
i
would
submit
the
responsibility
to
identify
particularly
in
an
initiative
--
an
initiative
context.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
would
submit
to
you
that
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
article
iii
or
in
any
of
this
court's
decisions
that
suggest
that
a
representative
of
a
state
must
be
--
have
a
fiduciary
duty,
but
i
would
also
suggest--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--and
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--and
the
california
supreme
court
specifically
addressed
and
rejected
that
specific
argument.
they
said
it
is
in
the
context
when
the
public
officials,
the
elected
officials,
the
appointed
officials,
have
declined,
have
declined
to
defend
a
statute.
a
statute
that,
by
the
way,
excuse
me,
in
this
case
a
constitutional
amendment,
was
brought
forward
by
the
initiative
process.
the
court
said
it
is
essential
to
the
integrity,
integrity
of
the
initiative
process
in
that
state,
which
is
a
precious
right
of
every
citizen,
the
initiative
process
in
that
state,
to
ensure
that
when
public
officials
--
and
after
all,
the
initiative
process
is
designed
to
control
those
very
public
officials,
to
take
issues
out
of
their
hands.
and
if
public
officials
could
effectively
veto
an
initiative
by
refusing
to
appeal
it,
then
the
initiative
process
would
be
invalidated.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
what
i
want
to
say,
your
honor,
is
according
to
the
california
supreme
court,
the
california
constitution
says
in
terms
that
among
the
responsibilities
of
official
proponents,
in
addition
to
the
many
other
responsibilities
that
they
step
forward
and
they
assume
in
the
initiative
process,
among
those
responsibilities
and
authorities
is
to
defend
that
initiative
if
the
public
officials
which
the
initiative
process
is
designed
to
control
have
refused
to
do
it.
it
might
as
well
say
it
in
those
terms,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
my
--
my
--
excuse
me.
as
i
was
saying,
the
accepted
truth
--
excuse
me.
the
accepted
truth
that
--
that
the
new
york
high
court
observed
is
one
that
is
changing
and
changing
rapidly
in
this
country
as
people
throughout
the
country
engage
in
an
earnest
debate
over
whether
the
age-old
definition
of
marriage
should
be
changed
to
include
same-sex
couples.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
constitution
puts
a
stop
to
that
ongoing
democratic
debate
and
answers
this
question
for
all
50
states.
and
it
does
so
only
if
the
respondents
are
correct
that
no
rational,
thoughtful
person
of
goodwill
could
possibly
disagree
with
them
in
good
faith
on
this
agonizingly
difficult
issue.
the
issues,
the
constitutional
issues
that
have
been
presented
to
the
court,
are
not
of
first
impression
here.
in
baker
v.
nelson,
this
court
unanimously
dismissed
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that
is--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
certainly
i
acknowledge
the
precedential
limitations
of
a
summary
dismissal.
but
baker
v.
nelson
also
came
fairly
fast
on
the
heels
of
the
loving
decision.
and,
your
honor,
i
simply
make
the
observation
that
it
seems
implausible
in
the
extreme,
frankly,
for
nine
justices
to
have
--
to
have
seen
no
substantial
federal
question
if
it
is
true,
as
the
respondents
maintain,
that
the
traditional
definition
of
marriage
insofar
as
--
insofar
as
it
does
not
include
same-sex
couples,
insofar
as
it
is
a
gender
definition
is
irrational
and
can
only
be
explained,
can
only
be
explained,
as
a
result
of
anti-gay
malice
and
a
bare
desire
to
harm.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor.
and
we
do
not.
we
do
not
think
it
is
properly
viewed
as
a
gender-based
classification.
virtually
every
appellate
court,
state
and
federal,
with
one
exception,
hawaii,
in
a
superseded
opinion,
has
agreed
that
it
is
not
a
gender-based
classification,
but
i
guess
it
is
gender-based
in
the
sense
that
marriage
itself
is
a
gendered
institution,
a
gendered
term,
and
so
in
the
same
way
that
fatherhood
is
gendered
more
motherhood
is
gendered,
it's
gendered
in
that
sense.
but
we
--
we
agree
that
to
the
extent
that
the
classification
impacts,
as
it
clearly
does,
same-sex
couples,
that
--
that
classification
can
be
viewed
as
being
one
of
sexual
orientation
rather
than--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
cannot.
i
do
not
have
any
--
anything
to
offer
you
in
that
regard.
i
think
marriage
is--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
your
honor,
we
certainly
are
not.
we
--
we
are
saying
the
interest
in
marriage
and
the
--
and
the
state
's
interest
and
society's
interest
in
what
we
have
framed
as
responsible
pro
--
procreation
is
--
is
vital,
but
at
bottom,
with
respect
to
those
interests,
our
submission
is
that
same-sex
couples
and
opposite-sex
couples
are
simply
not
similarly
situated.
but
to
come
back
to
your
precise
question,
i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
you're
probing
into
whether
or
not
sexual
orientation
ought
to
be
viewed
as
a
quasi-suspect
or
suspect
class,
and
our
position
is
that
it
does
not
qualify
under
this
court's
standard
and
--
and
traditional
tests
for
identifying
suspectedness.
the
--
the
class
itself
is
--
is
quite
amorphous.
it
defies
consistent
definition
as
--
as
the
plaintiffs'
own
experts
were
--
were
quite
vivid
on.
it
--
it
does
not
--
it
--
it
does
not
qualify
as
an
accident
of
birth,
immutability
in
that
--
in
that
sense.
again,
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
--
that
--
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
very
different
question
whether
or
not
the
government
can
proceed
arbitrarily
and
irrationally
with
respect
to
any
group
of
people,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
qualify
under
this
court's
traditional
test
for
suspectedness.
and
--
and
the
hypothetical
i
understood
you
to
be
offering,
i
would
submit
would
create
--
it
would
--
unless
there's
something
that
--
that
is
not
occurring
to
me
immediately,
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
distinction
among
similarly
situated
individuals,
that
--
that
is
not
what
we
think
is
at
the
--
at
the
root
of
the
traditional
definition
of
marriage.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
--
your
honor,
that's
the
essential
thrust
of
our
--
our
position,
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
we
--
we
go
further
in
--
in
the
sense
that
it
is
reasonable
to
be
very
concerned
that
redefining
marriage
to
--
as
a
genderless
institution
could
well
lead
over
time
to
harms
to
that
institution
and
to
the
interests
that
society
has
always
--
has
--
has
always
used
that
institution
to
address.
but,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--once
again,
i
--
i
would
reiterate
that
we
don't
believe
that's
the
correct
legal
question
before
the
court,
and
that
the
correct
question
is
whether
or
not
redefining
marriage
to
include
same-sex
couples
would
advance
the
interests
of
marriage
as
a--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
your
honor,
no.
i'm
not
conceding
that.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
thank
you,
justice
kennedy.
i
have
two
points
to
make
on
them.
the
first
one
is
this:
the
plaintiffs'
expert
acknowledged
that
redefining
marriage
will
have
real-world
consequences,
and
that
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
foresee
the
future
accurately
enough
to
know
exactly
what
those
real-world
consequences
would
be.
and
among
those
real-world
consequences,
your
honor,
we
would
suggest
are
adverse
consequences.
but
consider
the
california
voter,
in
2008,
in
the
ballot
booth,
with
the
question
before
her
whether
or
not
this
age-old
bedrock
social
institution
should
be
fundamentally
redefined,
and
knowing
that
there's
no
way
that
she
or
anyone
else
could
possibly
know
what
the
long-term
implications
of
--
of
profound
redefinition
of
a
bedrock
social
institution
would
be.
that
is
reason
enough,
your
honor,
that
would
hardly
be
irrational
for
that
voter
to
say,
i
believe
that
this
experiment,
which
is
now
only
fairly
four
years
old,
even
in
massachusetts,
the
oldest
state
that
is
conducting
it,
to
say,
i
think
it
better
for
california
to
hit
the
pause
button
and
await
additional
information
from
the
jurisdictions
where
this
experiment
is
still
maturing.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
no,
your
honor.
and
there's
--
there's--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
it
--
it
is
certainly
among
the--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--that's
right,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
and
--
but
--
but,
your
honor,
here's
--
here's
the
point--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--and
--
and
that,
your
honor,
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
and
it
is
the
respondents'
responsibility
to
prove,
under
rational
basis
review,
not
only
that
--
that
there
clearly
will
be
no
harm,
but
that
it's
beyond
debate
that
there
will
be
no
harm.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that's
true,
your
honor.
and
if
there
were
a
way
to
cabin
the
arguments
that
are
being
presented
to
you
to
california,
then
the
concerns
about
redefining
marriage
in
california
could
be
confined
to
california,
but
they
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
not
dispute
the
importance
of
that
consideration.
that
consideration
especially
in
the
political
process,
where
this
issue
is
being
debated
and
will
continue
to
be
debated,
certainly,
in
california.
it's
being
debated
elsewhere.
but
on
that
--
on
that
specific
question,
your
honor,
there
simply
is
no
data.
in
fact,
their
expert
agreed
there
is
no
data,
no
study,
even,
that
would
examine
whether
or
not
there
is
any
incremental
beneficial
effect
from
marriage
over
and
above
the
domestic
partnership
laws
that
were
enacted
by
the
state
of
california
to
recognize,
support,
and
honor
same-sex
relationships
and
their
families.
there
is
simply
no
data
at
all
that
would
permit
one
to
draw
--
draw
that
conclusion.
i
would
recall,
justice
kennedy,
the
point
made
in
romer,
that
under
a
rational
basis
of
review,
the
provision
will
be
sustained
even
if
it
operates
to
the
disadvantage
of
a
group,
if
it
is
--
if
it
otherwise
advances
rationally
a
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
oh--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--you're--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
the
concern
is
that
redefining
marriage
as
a
genderless
institution
will
sever
its
abiding
connection
to
its
historic
traditional
procreative
purposes,
and
it
will
refocus,
refocus
the
purpose
of
marriage
and
the
definition
of
marriage
away
from
the
raising
of
children
and
to
the
emotional
needs
and
desires
of
adults,
of
adult
couples.
suppose,
in
turn--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
constitutional.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
even
with
respect
to
couples
over
the
age
of
55,
it
is
very
rare
that
both
couples
--
both
parties
to
the
couple
are
infertile,
and
the
traditional
----
[laughter]
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
society's
--
society's
interest
in
responsible
procreation
isn't
just
with
respect
to
the
procreative
capacities
of
the
couple
itself.
the
marital
norm,
which
imposes
the
obligations
of
fidelity
and
monogamy,
your
honor,
advances
the
interests
in
responsible
procreation
by
making
it
more
likely
that
neither
party,
including
the
fertile
party
to
that--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
and
even
asking
about
age,
you
would
have
to
ask
if
both
parties
are
infertile.
again--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--very
few
men
--
very
few
men
outlive
their
own
fertility.
so
i
just--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--and
your
honor,
again,
the
marital
norm
which
imposes
upon
that
couple
the
obligation
of
fidelity--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--it's
designed,
your
honor,
to
make
it
less
likely
that
either
party
to
that
--
to
that
marriage
will
engage
in
irresponsible
procreative
conduct
outside
of
that
marriage.
outside
of
that
marriage.
that's
the
marital
--
that's
the
marital
norm.
society
has
an
interest
in
seeing
a
55-year-old
couple
that
is
--
just
as
it
has
an
interest
of
seeing
any
heterosexual
couple
that
intends
to
engage
in
a
prolonged
period
of
cohabitation
to
reserve
that
until
they
have
made
a
marital
commitment,
a
marital
commitment.
so
that,
should
that
union
produce
any
offspring,
it
would
be
more
likely
that
that
child
or
children
will
be
raised
by
the
mother
and
father
who
brought
them
into
the
world.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor
is
referring,
i'm
sure,
to
the
turner
case,
and--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--i
think
that,
with
due
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
way
over-reads
--
way
over-reads
turner
against
safley.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
prison
at
issue
--
and
it
was
decided
in
the
specific
context
of
a
particular
prison
where
there
were
both
female
and
male
inmates,
many
of
them
minimum
security
inmates.
it
was
dealing
with
a
regulation,
your
honor,
that
had
previously
permitted
marriage
in
the
case
of
pregnancy
and
childbirth.
the
court
--
the
court
here
emphasized
that,
among
the
incidents
of
marriage
that
are
not
destroyed
by
that
--
at
least
that
prison
context,
was
the
expectation
of
eventual
consummation
of
the
marriage
and
legitimation
of
--
of
the
children.
so
that--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
one
thing
on
which
i
wholeheartedly
agree
with
my
friend
mr.
olson.
this
case
was
properly
--
is
now
properly
before
the
court
and
was
properly
granted,
even
if,
even
if,
your
honor,
one
could
defend
the
--
the
specific
judgment
below
for
the
ninth
circuit,
a
defense
that
i
haven't
heard
offered
to
this
court.
judicial
redefinition
of
marriage
even
in
--
even
if
it
can
be
limited
to
california,
is
well
worthy
of
this
court's
attention,
particularly,
your
honor,
as
it
come
from
a
single
district
court
judge
in
a
single
jurisdiction.
i
would
also
like--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--because,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
it
is
hard
to--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
case
that
would
be
better,
or
more
thoroughly,
i
should
say,
at
least,
briefed
and
argued
to
this
court.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
and
in
this
particular
case,
to
not
grant
certiorari
is
to
essentially
bless
a
judicial
decision
that
there
--
that
at
least
in
the
state
of
california,
the
people
have
no
authority
to
step
back,
hit
the
pause
button,
and
allow
the
experiments
that
are
taking
place
in
this
country
to
further
mature;
that
in
fact,
at
least
in
california
--
and
it's
impossible
to
limit
this
ruling,
your
honor,
even
to
california,
even
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
he
says,
applies
to
at
least
eight
states.
it's
impossible
to
limit
these
propositions
to
any
particular
jurisdiction,
so
this
court
would
be
making
a
very
real
decision
with
respect
to
same-sex
marriage
if
it
should
simply
decide
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
justice
kennedy.
and
let's
just
step
back
and
just
consider
for
a
moment
the
solicitor
general's
argument.
he
is
basically
submitting
to
the
court
that
essentially
the
one
compromise
that
is
not
available
to
the
states
is
the
one
that
the
state
of
california
has
undertaken;
that
is,
to
go
as
far
as
the
people
possibly
can
in
honoring
and
recognizing
the
families
and
the
relationships
of
same-sex
couples,
while
still
preserving
the
existence
of
traditional
marriage
as
an
institution.
that's
the
one
thing
that's
off
the
table.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
forgive
me,
justice
ginsburg.
the
case
of
--
what
case
isn't
before
the
court?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
certainly.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
it's
--
yes,
your
honor.
and
well,
forgive
me,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following
the
court's
question.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
forgive
me.
and,
you
know,
i'm
glad
that
counsel
for
the
respondents
mentioned
the
loving
case,
because
what
this
court
--
what
this
court
ultimately
said
was
patently
obvious,
is
that
the
colors
of
the
skin
of
the
spouses
is
irrelevant
to
any
legitimate
purpose,
no
more
so
than
their
hair
colors,
any
legitimate
purpose
of
marriage,
that
interracial
couples
and
same-race
couples
are
similarly
situated
in
every
respect
with
respect
to
any
legitimate
purpose
of
marriage.
that's
what
this
question
really
boils
down
here,
whether
or
not
it
can
be
said
that
for
every
legitimate
purpose
of
marriage,
are
opposite-sex
couples
and
same-sex
couples
indistinguishable,
indistinguishable.
and
with
all
due
respect
to
counsel
and
to
the
respondents,
that
is
not
a
hard
question.
if,
in
fact,
it
is
true,
as
the
people
of
california
believe
that
it
still
is
true,
that
the
natural
procreative
capacity
of
opposite-sex
couples
continues
to
pose
vitally
important
benefits
and
risks
to
society,
and
that's
why
marriage
itself
is
the
institution
that
society
has
always
used
to
regulate
those
heterosexual,
procreative
--
procreative
relationships.
counsel
--
the
solicitor
general
has
said
that
the
ban
that
the
proposition
erects
in
california
is
permanent.
well,
it's
--
certainly
that
is
not
the
view
of
the
respondents
and
what
we
read
every
day.
this
is
not
an
issue
that
is
now
at
rest
in
the
state
of
california,
regardless
--
well,
unless
this
court
essentially
puts
it
to
rest.
that
democratic
debate,
which
is
roiling
throughout
this
country,
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
california.
it
is
an
agonizingly
difficult,
for
many
people,
political
question.
we
would
submit
to
you
that
that
question
is
properly
decided
by
the
people
themselves.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
