justice

sotomayor
but
can
you
tell
me
--
that's
a
factual
background
with
respect
to
their
right
to
put
the
ballot
initiative
on
the
ballot,
but
how
does
it
create
an
injury
to
them
separate
from
that
of
every
other
taxpayer
to
have
laws
enforced?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
least
one
of
the
amici
have
suggested
that
it
seems
counterintuitive
to
think
that
the
state
is
going
to
delegate
to
people
who
don't
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
them,
that
it's
going
to
delegate
the
responsibility
of
representing
the
state
to
individuals
who
have
their
own
views.
they
proposed
the
ballot
initiative
because
it
was
their
individual
views,
not
necessarily
that
of
the
state.
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--justice
scalia
proffered
the
question
of
the
attorney
general.
the
attorney
general
has
no
personal
interest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
has
a
fiduciary
obligation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
the
fiduciary
duty
requirement
before
the
state
can
designate
a
representative
important?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
generally
you
don't
need
to
specify
it
because
generally
the
people
who
get
to
enforce
the
legislation
of
the
government
are
people
who
are
in
government
positions
elected
by
the
people.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
here
these
individuals
are
not
elected
by
the
people
or
appointed
by
the
people.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
outside
of
the
--
outside
of
the
marriage
context,
can
you
think
of
any
other
rational
basis,
reason,
for
a
state
using
sexual
orientation
as
a
factor
in
denying
homosexuals
benefits
or
imposing
burdens
on
them?
is
there
any
other
rational
decision-making
that
the
government
could
make?
denying
them
a
job,
not
granting
them
benefits
of
some
sort,
any
other
decision?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
if
that
--
if
that
is
true,
then
why
aren't
they
a
class?
if
they're
a
class
that
makes
any
other
discrimination
improper,
irrational,
then
why
aren't
we
treating
them
as
a
class
for
this
one
thing?
are
you
saying
that
the
interest
of
marriage
is
so
much
more
compelling
than
any
other
interest
as
they
could
have?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
--
so
what
--
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
if
you're
not
dealing
with
this
as
a
class
question,
then
why
would
you
say
that
the
government
is
not
free
to
discriminate
against
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
where
is
this--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
olson,
i
think
the
bottom
line--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
olson,
i
think
that
you're
not
answering
the
fundamental
fear.
and
so
--
and
--
and
the
amici
brief
that
sets
forth
this
test
of
fiduciary
duty
doesn't
quite
either.
the
assumption
is
that
there
are
not
executive
officials
who
want
to
defend
the
law.
they
don't
like
it.
no
one's
going
to
do
that.
so
how
do
you
get
the
law
defended
in
that
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
--
why
isn't
this
viewed
as
an
appointment
process,
that
the
in
--
the
ballot
initiators
have
now
become
that
body?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
your
argument--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
olson,
the
bottom
line
that
you're
being
asked
--
and
--
and
it
is
one
that
i'm
interested
in
the
answer:
if
you
say
that
marriage
is
a
fundamental
right,
what
state
restrictions
could
ever
exist?
meaning,
what
state
restrictions
with
respect
to
the
number
of
people,
with
respect
to
--
that
could
get
married
--
the
incest
laws,
the
mother
and
child,
assuming
that
they
are
the
age
--
i
can
--
i
can
accept
that
the
state
has
probably
an
overbearing
interest
on
--
on
protecting
a
child
until
they're
of
age
to
marry,
but
what's
left?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
way
to
decide
this
case
in
a
principled
manner
that
is
limited
to
california
only?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
there
is
an
irony
in
that,
which
is
the
states
that
do
more
have
less
rights.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
would
the
record
be
different
elsewhere?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
are
not
the
only
ones.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
that
begs
your
--
mr.
olson
doesn't
really
focus
on
this.
if
the
issue
is
letting
the
states
experiment
and
letting
the
society
have
more
time
to
figure
out
its
direction,
why
is
taking
a
case
now
the
answer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
let
issues
perk,
and
so
we
let
racial
segregation
perk
for
50
years
from
1898
to
1954.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
now
we
are
only
talking
about,
at
most,
four
years.
