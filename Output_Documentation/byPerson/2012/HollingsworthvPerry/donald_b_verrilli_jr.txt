mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
proposition
8
denies
gay
and
lesbian
persons
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--as
an
amicus,
i
thought
i
might
actually,
your
honor.
and
--
and,
of
course,
we
didn't
take
a
position
on
standing.
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
brief
it,
we
don't
have
a
formal
position
on
standing.
but
i
will
offer
this
observation
based
on
the
discussion
today
and
the
briefing.
we
do
think
that
while
it's
certainly
not
free
of
doubt,
that
the
better
argument
is
that
there
is
not
article
iii
standing
here
because
--
i
don't
want
to
go
beyond
just
summarizing
our
position,
but
--
because
we
don't
have
a
formal
position.
but
we
do
think
that
with
respect
to
standing,
that
at
this
point
with
the
initiative
process
over,
that
petitioners
really
have
what
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
generalized
grievance
and
because
they're
not
an
agent
of
the
state
of
california
or
don't
have
any
other
official
tie
to
the
state
that
would
--
would
result
in
any
official
control
of
their
litigation,
that
the
better
conclusion
is
that
there's
not
article
iii
standing
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
we
said
this
was
a
--
we
said
this
was
a
close
question,
and
--
and
our
interests
are,
justice
alito,
in
tomorrow's
issues
where
we
have
briefed
the
matter
thoroughly
and
will
be
prepared
to
discuss
it
with
the
court
tomorrow.
with
respect
to
the
merits,
two
fundamental
points
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
there's
an
equal
protection
violation
here.
first,
every
warning
flag
that
warrants
exacting
scrutiny
is
present
in
this
case.
and
petitioners'
defense
of
proposition
8
requires
the
court
to
ignore
those
warning
flags
and
instead
apply
highly
deferential
lee
optical
rational
basis
review
as
though
proposition
8
were
on
a
par
with
the
law
of
treating
opticians
less
favorably
than
optometrists,
when
it
really
is
the
polar
opposite
of
such
a
law.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
gets
to
my
second
point,
your
honor,
which
is
that
i
do
think
the
problem
here
with
the
arguments
that
petitioners
are
advancing
is
that
california's
own
laws
do
cut
the
legs
out
from
under
all
of
the
justifications
that
petitioners
have
offered
in
defense
of
proposition
8,
and
i
understand
your
honor's
point
and
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
raised
earlier,
but
i
do
think
this
court's
equal
protection
jurisprudence
requires
the
court
to
evaluate
the
interests
that
the
state
puts
forward,
not
in
a
vacuum,
but
in
the
context
of
the
actual
substance
of
california
law.
and
here,
with
respect
to
california
law,
gay
and
lesbian
couples
do
have
the
legal
rights
and
benefits
of
marriage,
full
equality
and
adoption,
full
access
to
assistive
reproduction,
and
therefore,
the
argument
about
the
state's
interests
that
--
that
petitioners
advance
have
to
be
tested
against
that
reality,
and
--
and
they
just
don't
measure
up.
none
of
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
because
you
have
to
measure
the
--
under
the
standard
of
equal
protection
scrutiny
that
we
think
this
court's
cases
require.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
we
--
what
we're
--
what
we're
saying
about
that
is
that
we're
not
prepared
to
close
the
door
to
an
argument
in
another
state
where
the
state's
interests
haven't
cut
the
legs
out
from
under
the
arguments.
and
i
think
--
i
suppose
the
caution
rationale
that
mr.
cooper
identified
with
respect
to
the
effects
on
children,
if
it
came
up
in
a
different
case
with
a
different
record,
after
all
here,
this
case
was
litigated
by
petitioners
on
the
theory
that
rational
basis
applied
and
they
didn't
need
to
show
anything,
and
so
they
didn't
try
to
show
anything.
our
view
is
that
heightened
scrutiny
should
apply,
and
so
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
kid
about
this,
we
understand,
that
would
be
a
very
heavy
burden
for
a
state
to
meet.
all
we're
suggesting
is
that
in
a
situation
in
which
the
--
the
state
interests
aren't
cut
out
from
under
it,
as
they
--
as
they
are
here,
that
that
issue
ought
to
remain
open
for
a
future
case.
and
i
--
and
i
think
the
caution
rationale
would
be
the
one
place
where
we
might
leave
it
open.
because
you
can't
leave
it
open
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well
--
well,
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
i
do
think
that
you
have
to
think
about
the
claim
of
right
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
here.
and
in
this
situation,
california
--
the
argument
here
that
--
that
gay
and
lesbian
couples
can
be
denied
access
to
marriage
on
the
ground
of
an
interest
in
responsible
procreation
and
child
rearing
just
can't
stand
up
given
that
the
parents
have
full
equality,
the
gay
and
lesbian
parents
have
full
equality
apart
from--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
have
four
points
i
would
like
to
make
to
that
in
response
to
that,
justice
alito,
and
i
think
they
are
all
important.
first,
california
did
not
through
proposition
8
do
what
my
friend
mr.
cooper
said
and
push
a
pause
button.
they
pushed
a
delete
button.
this
is
a
permanent
ban.
it's
in
the
constitution.
it's
supposed
to
take
this
issue
out
from
the
legislative
process.
so
that's
the
first
point.
second--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
it
does
--
of
course
not.
but
it
is
--
but
the
aim
of
this
is
to
take
it
out
of
the
normal
legislative
process.
the
second
point
is
that,
with
respect
to
concerns
that
your
honor
has
raised,
california
has
been
anything
but
cautious.
it
has
given
equal
parenting
rights,
equal
adoption
rights.
those
rights
are
on
the
books
in
california
now,
and
so
the
interest
of
california
is
--
that
petitioners
are
articulating
with
respect
to
proposition
8,
has
to
be
measured
in
that
light.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
--
and
that's
why--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
respectfully
justice
scalia,
we
are
not.
our
position
is
narrower
than
that.
our
position
--
the
position
we
have
taken,
is
about
states,
it
applies
to
states
that
have,
like
california
and
perhaps
other
states,
that
have
granted
these
rights
short
of
marriage,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--we
are
not
--
we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
it
is
required
throughout
the
country.
we
think
that
that
ought
to
be
left
open
for
a
future
adjudication
in
other
states
that
don't
have
the
situation
california
has.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
--
i
see
my
red
light
is
on.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you.
our
position
is
--
i
would
just
take
out
a
red
pen
and
take
the
word
“
only
”
out
of
that
sentence.
when
that
is
true,
then
the
equal
protection
clause
forbids
the
exclusion
of
same-sex
marriage,
and
it's
an
open
question
otherwise.
and
if
i
could
just
get
to
the
third
reason,
which
i
do
think
is
quite
significant.
the
argument
here
about
caution
is
an
argument
that,
well,
we
need
to
wait.
we
understand
that.
we
take
it
seriously.
but
waiting
is
not
a
neutral
act.
waiting
imposes
real
costs
in
the
here
and
now.
it
denies
to
the
--
to
the
parents
who
want
to
marry
the
ability
to
marry,
and
it
denies
to
the
children,
ironically,
the
very
thing
that
petitioners
focus
on
is
at
the
heart
of
the
marriage
relationship.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
if
--
with
respect
to
a
state
that
allows
gay
couples
to
have
children
and
to
have
families
and
then
denies
the
stabilizing
effect--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
we
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--what
i
said
is
it's
an
open
question
with
respect
to
those
states
and
the
court
should
wait
and
see
what
kind
of
a
record
a
state
could
make.
but
in
california
you
can't
make
the
record
to
justify
the
exclusion.
and
the
fourth
point
i
would
make
on
this,
recognizing
that
these
situations
are
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
they
might
try
to
make
a
different
record
about
the
effects
on
children.
but
there
isn't
a
record
to
that
effect
here.
and
the
fourth
point
i
would
make,
and
i
do
think
this
is
significant,
is
that
the
principal
argument
in
1967
with
respect
to
loving
and
that
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
advanced
was:
well,
the
social
science
is
still
uncertain
about
how
biracial
children
will
fare
in
this
world,
and
so
you
ought
to
apply
rational
basis
scrutiny
and
wait.
and
i
think
the
court
recognized
that
there
is
a
cost
to
waiting
and
that
that
has
got
to
be
part
of
the
equal
protection
calculus.
and
so
--
so
i
do
think
that's
quite
fundamental.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
sure.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
think
what
proposition
8
does
is
deny
the
long-term
stabilizing
effect
that
marriage
brings.
that's
--
that's
the
argument
for
--
for
marriage,
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--california
--
there
are
37,000
children
in
same-sex
families
in
california
now.
their
parents
cannot
marry
and
that
has
effects
on
them
in
the
here
and
now.
a
stabilizing
effect
is
not
there.
when
they
go
to
school,
they
have
to,
you
know
--
they
don't
have
parents
like
everybody
else's
parents.
that's
a
real
effect,
a
real
cost
in
the
here
and
now.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
we
--
we
think
that,
as
i
started
my
argument,
your
honor,
that
all
the
warning
flags
for
exacting
equal
protection
scrutiny
are
present
here.
this
is
a
group
that
has
suffered
a
history
of
terrible
discrimination.
the
petitioners
don't
deny
it.
petitioners
said
at
the
podium
today
that
there
is
no
justification
for
that
discrimination
in
any
realm
other
than
the
one
posed
in
this
case,
and
the
--
and
so
when
those
two
factors
are
present,
those
are
paradigm
considerations
for
the
application
of
heightened
scrutiny,
and
so
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
the
states
that
haven't
taken
those
steps--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that
states
that
haven't
taken
this
step,
that
they
are
going
to
have
an
easy
time
meeting
heightened
scrutiny,
which
i
think
has
to
apply--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
would
be
a
different
case.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
door
ought
to
remain
open
to
that
case,
not
that
it
would
be
easy
for
the
state
to
prevail
in
that
case.
