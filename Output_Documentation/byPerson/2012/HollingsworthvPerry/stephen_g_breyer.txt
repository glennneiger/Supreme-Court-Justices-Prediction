that's
--
historically,
i
think,
40
states,
many
states
have
what
was
called
a
public
action.
a
public
action
is
an
action
by
any
citizen
primarily
to
vindicate
the
interest
in
seeing
that
the
law
is
enforced.
now,
that's
the
kind
of
action
i
think
that
this
court
has
interpreted
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
case
in
controversy,
to
say
that
it
does
not
lie
in
the
federal
system.
and
of
course,
if
that
kind
of
action
is
the
very
kind
that
does
not
lie,
well,
then
to
say,
but
they
really
feel
it's
important
that
the
law
be
enforced,
they
really
want
to
vindicate
the
process,
and
these
are
people
of
special
interests,
we
found
the
five
citizens
who
most
strongly
want
to
vindicate
the
interest
in
the
law
being
enforced
and
the
process
for
making
the
law
be
enforced,
well,
that
won't
distinguish
it
from
a
public
action.
but
then
you
say,
but
also
they
are
representing
the
state.
at
this
point,
the
dellinger
brief
which
takes
the
other
side
of
it
is
making
a
strong
argument,
well,
they
are
really
no
more
than
a
group
of
five
people
who
feel
really
strongly
that
we
should
vindicate
this
public
interest,
and
have
good
reason
for
thinking
it.
so
you
have
read
all
these
arguments
that
it's
not
really
the
agent
and
so
forth.
what
do
you
want
to
say
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
long
as
you
are
on
that,
then
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this:
assume
you
could
distinguish
california,
suppose
we
accept
your
argument
or
accept
justice
scalia's
version
of
your
argument
and
that
distinguishes
california.
now,
let's
look
at
california.
what
precisely
is
the
way
in
which
allowing
gay
couples
to
marry
would
interfere
with
the
vision
of
marriage
as
procreation
of
children
that
allowing
sterile
couples
of
different
sexes
to
marry
would
not?
i
mean,
there
are
lots
of
people
who
get
married
who
can't
have
children.
to
take
a
state
that
does
allow
adoption
and
say
--
there,
what
is
the
justification
for
saying
no
gay
marriage?
certainly
not
the
one
you
said,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
not
clear?
look,
you
said
that
the
problem
is
marriage;
that
it
is
an
institution
that
furthers
procreation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
there
was
adoption,
but
that
doesn't
apply
to
california.
so
imagine
i
wall
off
california
and
i'm
looking
just
there,
where
you
say
that
doesn't
apply.
now,
what
happens
to
your
argument
about
the
institution
of
marriage
as
a
tool
towards
procreation?
given
the
fact
that,
in
california,
too,
couples
that
aren't
gay
but
can't
have
children
get
married
all
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
brief
says
is,
of
course,
you
can
appoint
people.
it's
not
just
that
you
appoint
them,
it's
that
the
state's
interest,
when
it
defends
a
law,
is
the
interest
in
executing
the
law
of
the
state.
so
all
you
have
to
do
is
give
a
person
that
interest.
but
when
a
person
has
the
interest
of
defending
this
law,
as
opposed
to
defending
the
law
of
the
state
of
california,
there
can
be
all
kinds
of
conflicts,
all
kinds
of
situations.
that's
what
i
got
out
of
the
brief.
so
give
the
person
that
interest.
and
that,
they
say,
is
what's
missing
here.
and
you'll
say
--
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
here,
and
you
say
it's
missing
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
it
missing
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
one
--
look,
a
state
that
does
nothing
for
gay
couples
hurts
them
much
more
than
a
state
that
does
something.
and,
of
course,
it's
true
that
it
does
hurt
their
argument
that
they
do
quite
a
lot,
but
which
are
their
good
arguments,
in
your
opinion?
i
mean,
take
a
state
that
really
does
nothing
whatsoever.
they
have
no
benefits,
no
nothing,
no
nothing.
okay?
and
moreover,
if
--
if
you're
right,
even
in
california,
if
they
have
--
if
they're
right
or,
you
know,
if
a
pact
is
enough,
they
won't
get
federal
benefits,
those
that
are
tied
to
marriage,
because
they're
not
married.
so
--
so
a
state
that
does
nothing
hurts
them
much
more,
and
yet
your
brief
seems
to
say
it's
more
likely
to
be
justified
under
the
constitution.
i'd
like
to
know
with
some
specificity
how
that
could
be.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
the
principle,
but
i'm
saying
which
are
their
good
arguments,
in
your
opinion,
that
would
be
good
enough
to
overcome
for
the
state
that
does
nothing,
but
not
good
enough
to
overcome
california
where
they
do
a
lot?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
real
cost
right
now
would
be
you're
asking
me
to
write
these
words:
"a
state
that
has
a
pact
has
to
say
“
marriage
”.
"
but
i'm
not
telling
you
about
states
that
don't.
well,
i
would
guess
there
is
a
real-world
effect
there,
too.
that
states
that
are
considering
pacts
will
all
say
“
we
won't
do
it
”,
or
not
all,
but
some
would.
and
that
would
have
a
real
effect
right
now.
and
at
the
moment,
i'm
thinking
it's
much
more
harmful
to
the
gay
couple,
the
latter
than
the
former.
but
you
won't
give
me
advice
as
the
government
as
to
how
to
deal
with
that.
