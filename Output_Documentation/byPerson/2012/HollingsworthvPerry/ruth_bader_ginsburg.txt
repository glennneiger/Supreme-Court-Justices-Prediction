have
we
ever
granted
standing
to
proponents
of
ballot
initiatives?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
this
is
--
this
is
--
the
concern
is
certainly,
the
proponents
are
interested
in
getting
it
on
the
ballot
and
seeing
that
all
of
the
proper
procedures
are
followed,
but
once
it's
passed,
they
have
no
proprietary
interest
in
it.
it's
law
for
them
just
as
it
is
for
everyone
else.
so
how
are
they
distinguishable
from
the
california
citizenry
in
general?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cooper,
baker
v.
nelson
was
1971.
the
supreme
court
hadn't
even
decided
that
gender-based
classifications
get
any
kind
of
heightened
scrutiny.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
same-sex
intimate
conduct
was
considered
criminal
in
many
states
in
1971,
so
i
don't
think
we
can
extract
much
in
baker
v.
nelson.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
california
--
no,
california
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
wouldn't
be
in
california,
mr.
cooper,
because
that's
not
an
issue,
is
it?
in
california,
you
can
have
same-sex
couples
adopting
a
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cooper,
you
are
defending
--
you
are
opposing
a
judgment
that
applies
to
california
only,
not
to
all
of
the
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cooper,
we
said
that
somebody
who
is
locked
up
in
prison
and
who
is
not
going
to
get
out
has
a
right
to
marry,
has
a
fundamental
right
to
marry,
no
possibility
of
procreation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
i
could
understand
your
argument
if
you
were
talking
about
the
entire
united
states,
but
you
--
your
brief
says
it's
only
eight
or
nine
states,
the
states
that
permit
civil
unions,
and
that's
--
brings
up
a
question
that
was
asked
before.
so
a
state
that
has
made
considerable
progress
has
to
go
all
the
way,
but
at
least
the
government's
position
is,
if
it
has
done
--
the
state
has
done
absolutely
nothing
at
all,
then
it's
--
it
can
do
--
do
as
it
will.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
one
of
those
states
repeals
its
civil
union
laws?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he
was
saying,
mr.
cooper,
that
it's
not
before
the
court
today.
and
remember
loving
against
virginia
was
preceded
by
the
mclaughlin
case.
so
first
there
was
the
question
of
no
marriage,
and
then
there
was
marriage.
so,
in
that
sense
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
to
be
telling
us
that
case
is
not
before
the
court
today.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it
was
mclaughlin
against
florida.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
cohabitation
of
people
of
different
races.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
court
took
that
case
and
waited
to
reach
the
merits
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
may
--
my
memory
may
be
wrong,
but
i
think
the
case
was
that
people
of
different
races
were
arrested
and
charged
with
the
crime
of
interracial
cohabitation.
and
the
court
said
that
that
was
invalid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
unlawful.
