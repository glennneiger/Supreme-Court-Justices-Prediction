chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
12-144,
hollingsworth
v.
perry.
mr.
cooper?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
cooper,
we
have
jurisdictional
and
merits
issues
here.
maybe
it'd
be
best
if
you
could
begin
with
the
standing
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
would
be
--
i'm
sorry,
are
you
finished?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
that
--
that
may
be
true
in
terms
of
who
they
want
to
represent,
but
--
but
a
state
can't
authorize
anyone
to
proceed
in
federal
court,
because
that
would
leave
the
definition
under
article
iii
of
the
federal
constitution
as
to
who
can
bring
--
who
has
standing
to
bring
claims
up
to
each
state.
and
i
don't
think
we've
ever
allowed
anything
like
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
if
you
want
to
proceed
to
the
merits,
you
should
feel
free
to
do
so.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
cooper,
we
will
afford
you
more
time.
you
shouldn't
worry
about
losing
your
rebuttal
time,
but
please
continue
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
maybe
you
can
finish
your
answer
to
justice
kagan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
cooper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson,
i
cut
off
your
friend
before
he
could
get
into
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
----
[laughter]
well,
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
treat
you
the
same.
perhaps
you
could
address
your
jurisdictional
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
there
might
be
people
out
there
with
their
own
personal
standing,
someone
who
performs
marriages
and
would
like
that
to
remain
open
to
everyone
but
would
prefer
not
to
perform
same-sex
marriages,
or
other
people.
we
seem
to
be
addressing
the
case
as
if
the
only
options
are
the
proponents
here
or
the
state.
i'm
not
sure
there
aren't
other
people
out
there
with
individual
personalized
injury
that
would
satisfy
article
iii.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
should
feel
free
to
move
on
to
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure,
counsel,
that
it
makes
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
right
to
view
this
as
excluding
a
particular
group.
when
the
institution
of
marriage
developed
historically,
people
didn't
get
around
and
say
let's
have
this
institution,
but
let's
keep
out
homosexuals.
the
institution
developed
to
serve
purposes
that,
by
their
nature,
didn't
include
homosexual
couples.
it
is
--
yes,
you
can
say
that
it
serves
some
of
the
other
interests
where
it
makes
sense
to
include
them,
but
not
all
the
interests.
and
it
seems
to
me,
your
friend
argues
on
the
other
side,
if
you
have
an
institution
that
pursues
additional
interests,
you
don't
have
to
include
everybody
just
because
some
other
aspects
of
it
can
be
applied
to
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
that's
only
because
proposition
8
came
140
days
after
the
california
supreme
court
issued
its
decision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
don't
you
think
it's
more
reasonable
to
view
it
as
a
change
by
the
california
supreme
court
of
this
institution
that's
been
around
since
time
immemorial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
your
case
--
your
case
would
be
different
if
proposition
8
was
enacted
into
law
prior
to
the
california
supreme
court
decision?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
just
about
--
it's
just
about
the
label
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
same-sex
couples
have
every
other
right,
it's
just
about
the
label.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
if
you
tell
--
if
you
tell
a
child
that
somebody
has
to
be
their
friend,
i
suppose
you
can
force
the
child
to
say,
this
is
my
friend,
but
it
changes
the
definition
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
friend.
and
that's
it
seems
to
me
what
the
--
what
supporters
of
proposition
8
are
saying
here.
you're
--
all
you're
interested
in
is
the
label
and
you
insist
on
changing
the
definition
of
the
label.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
know
--
how
do
we
know
that
that's
the
reason,
or
a
necessary
part
of
the
reason,
that
we've
recognized
marriage
as
a
fundamental
right?
that's
--
you've
emphasized
that
and
you've
said,
well,
it's
because
of
the
emotional
commitment.
maybe
it
is
the
procreative
aspect
that
makes
it
a
fundamental
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
verrilli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
think
you're
going
to
get
away
with
not
starting
with
the
jurisdictional
question,
do
you?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
--
i
want
you
to
get
back
to
justice
alito's
other
points,
but
is
it
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
same-sex
marriage
is
not
required
throughout
the
country?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
can
go
on.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
are
willing
to
wait
in
the
rest
of
the
country.
you
saying
it's
got
to
happen
right
now
in
california,
but
you
don't
even
have
a
position
about
whether
it's
required
in
the
rest
of
the
country.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
got
to
happen
right
away
in
those
states
where
same-sex
couples
have
every
legal
right
that
married
couples
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
can
wait
in
states
where
they
have
fewer
legal
rights.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
problem
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
your
position
that
you
are
supporting
is
somewhat
internally
inconsistent.
we
see
the
argument
made
that
there
is
no
problem
with
extending
marriage
to
same-sex
couples
because
children
raised
by
same-sex
couples
are
doing
just
fine
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
are
being
harmed.
and
the
other
argument
is
proposition
8
harms
children
by
not
allowing
same-sex
couples
to
marriage.
which
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you
also
tell
me
there
has
been
no
harm
shown
to
children
of
same-sex
couples.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
cooper,
to
keep
things
fair,
i
think
you
have
10
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finally
this
term
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
case
12-144,
hollingsworth
versus
perry.
in
2008,
the
california
supreme
court
decided
that
limiting
the
official
designation
of
marriage
to
opposite
sex
couples
violated
the
california
constitution.
later
that
year,
california
voters
passed
the
ballot
initiative
at
the
center
of
this
dispute
known
as
proposition
8.
that
proposition
amended
the
california
constitution
to
provide
that
“only
marriage
between
a
man
and
a
woman
is
valid
and
recognized
in
california.”
respondents,
two
same
sex
couples
who
wish
to
marry,
filed
suit
in
federal
court,
challenging
proposition
8
under
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
the
complaint
named
as
defendants
california's
governor
and
various
other
state
officials
responsible
for
enforcing
california's
marriage
laws.
those
officials
refused
to
defend
the
law
and
the
district
court
allowed
petitioners,
the
official
proponents
of
the
ballot
initiative,
to
defend
it
instead.
after
trial,
the
district
court
declared
proposition
8
unconstitutional
and
prohibited
california
officials
from
enforcing
it.
those
officials
chose
not
to
appeal
the
court
order.
when
the
initiative
proponents
did,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
decided
it
was
necessary
to
direct
the
question
about
california
law
to
the
california
supreme
court.
there
is
a
procedure
for
doing
that
under
the
federal
rules.
the
ninth
circuit
asked
the
california
court
“whether
under
california
law,
the
official
proponents
of
a
ballot
initiative
like
proposition
8
possess
the
authority
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
initiative
when
the
public
officials
charged
with
that
duty
refuse
to
do
so.
the
california
supreme
court
answered,
“yes.”
relying
on
that
answer,
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
proponents
could
defend
the
constitutionality
of
proposition
8
in
federal
court.
on
the
merits,
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
proposition
8
was
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
and
affirmed
the
district
court
order.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
determination.
before
addressing
the
merits
of
the
question
in
this
case,
however,
we
must
assure
ourselves
that
we
have
authority
under
the
federal
constitution
to
do
so.
we
do
not
have
general
authority
to
answer
questions
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
happen
to
come
up
from
time
to
time.
instead
we
have
authority
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution
to
resolve
particular
cases
or
controversies.
and
sometimes,
in
doing
that,
it
is
necessary
to
decide
a
question
of
constitutional
law.
that's
where
our
authority
comes
from.
so,
it
is
very
important
to
make
sure
that
we
have
before
us
an
actual
case
or
controversy.
as
used
in
the
constitution,
those
words
do
not
include
every
sort
of
dispute,
but
only
those,
as
we
put
it
in
a
prior
precedent,
“historically
viewed
as
capable
of
resolution
through
the
judicial
process.”
this
is
an
essential
limit
on
our
power.
it
ensures
that
we
act
as
judges
deciding
cases
and
do
not
engage
in
general
policy
making
properly
left
to
elected
representatives.
for
there
to
be,
such
a
case
or
controversy,
it
is
not
enough
that
the
party
invoking
the
power
of
the
court
have
a
keen
interest
in
the
issue.
that
party
must
also
have
--
what
our
cases
refer
to
as
standing.
to
have
standing
to
invoke
the
power
of
a
federal
court,
a
litigant
must
prove
that
he
has
suffered
a
concrete
and
particularized
injury
that
is
traceable
to
the
defendant
and
could
be
redressed
by
the
federal
court.
that
requirement
must
be
met
by
person
seeking
appellant
review
just
as
it
must
be
met
by
person's
appearing
in
court
for
the
first
time.
the
parties
in
this
case
do
not
contest
that
respondents,
the
same
sex
couples,
had
standing
to
initiate
the
case
in
the
district
court
against
the
california
officials
responsible
for
enforcing
proposition
8.
after
the
district
court
declared
proposition
8
unconstitutional
and
prohibited
the
california
officials
from
enforcing
it,
however,
things
changed.
the
same
sex
couples
no
longer
had
any
injury
to
redress,
they
had
won,
and
the
state
officials
chose
not
to
appeal.
the
only
individuals
who
sought
to
appeal
were
petitioners,
the
official
proponents
of
proposition
8,
but
the
district
court
had
not
ordered
them
to
do
or
refrain
from
doing
anything.
to
have
standing,
a
litigant
must
possess
a
direct
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
here,
petitioners
had
no
direct
stake
in
the
outcome
of
their
appeal.
their
only
interest
in
having
the
district
court
order
reversed
was
to
vindicate
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
generally
applicable
california
law.
we
have,
however,
repeatedly
held
that
such
a
generalize
grievance,
no
matter
how
sincere,
is
insufficient
to
confer
standing.
petitioners
argue
that
they
have
standing
because
california
law
gives
them
a
unique
and
special
role
in
the
initiative
process.
that
is
true
enough,
but
only
when
it
comes
to
the
process
of
enacting
the
law.
once
proposition
8
was
approved
by
the
voters,
the
measure
became
a
duly
enacted
constitutional
amendment.
petitioners
have
no
role,
special
or
otherwise,
in
enforcing
proposition
8.
they,
therefore,
have
no
personal
stake
in
defending
its
enforcement
that
is
distinguishable
from
the
general
interest
of
every
citizen
of
california.
no
matter
how
deeply
committed
petitioners
may
be
to
upholding
proposition
8
that
is
not
a
particularized
interest
sufficient
to
create
a
case
or
controversy
under
article
iii.
the
proponents
further
argue
that
even
if
they
have
no
recognized
interest
in
appealing
the
district
court's
order,
the
state
of
california
does
and
they
may
assert
that
interest
on
the
state's
behalf.
it
is,
however,
a
fundamental
restriction
on
our
authority
that
a
litigant
must
assert
his
or
her
own
legal
rights
and
interests
and
cannot
rest
acclaim
to
relief
on
the
legal
rights
or
interests
of
third
parties.
there
are
certain
limited
exceptions
to
that
rule,
but
even
when
we
have
allowed
litigants
to
assert
the
interest
of
others,
the
litigants
themselves
still
must
have
suffered
their
own
injury
giving
them
a
sufficiently
concrete
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
issue
in
dispute.
and
as
just
explained
the
petitioners
have
not
suffered
such
an
injury
and
therefore
would
ordinarily
have
no
standing
to
assert
the
state's
interest,
but
petitioners
contend
that
this
case
is
different.
the
california
supreme
court
after
all
has
determined
that
they
are
“authorized
under
california
law
to
appear
and
assert
the
state's
interest
in
the
validity
of
proposition
8.”
petitioners
argue
that
by
virtue
of
that
decision,
they
are
authorized
to
act
as,
as
they
put
it,
agents
of
the
people
of
california.
but
the
california
supreme
court
never
described
petitioners
as
agents
of
the
people
and
petitioners
are
plainly
not
in
an
agency
relationship
with
anyone.
agency
requires
more
than
bare
authorization
to
assert
a
particular
interest.
for
one,
agency
requires
some
degree
of
control
by
a
principle,
yet
the
petitioners
answer
to
no
one.
where
an
agency
relationship
exists,
the
agent
owes
a
duty
of
loyalty
to
the
principal,
but
the
proponents
owe
nothing
to
the
people
of
california.
they
are
free
to
pursue
a
purely
ideological
commitment
to
the
law's
constitutionality
without
the
need
to
take
cognizance
of
resource,
constraints,
changes
in
public
opinion,
or
potential
ramifications
for
other
state
priorities.
the
proponents
act
for
themselves,
but
their
interest
is
a
generalized
one
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
and
that
is
not
enough
to
pursue
a
case
in
federal
court.
in
deciding
that
petitioners
do
not
have
standing
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
proposition
8,
we
do
not
question
california's
sovereign
right
to
maintain
an
initiative
process
or
the
right
of
initiative
proponents
to
defend
their
initiatives
in
state
courts.
but
standing
in
federal
court
is
a
question
of
federal
law
and
the
federal
constitution's
requirement
that
a
party
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court
seek
relief
for
a
personal
particularized
injury
serves
vital
interest
going
to
the
role
of
the
judiciary
in
our
system
of
separated
powers.
refusing
to
entertain
generalized
grievances
ensures
that
courts
exercise
power
that
is
judicial,
rather
than
political
in
nature
and
ensures
that
the
federal
judiciary
respects
the
proper
and
properly
limited
role
of
the
courts
in
a
democratic
society.
states
cannot
alter
that
role
simply
by
issuing
to
private
parties
who
otherwise
lack
standing
a
ticket
to
the
federal
court
house.
we
were
asked
in
this
case
to
decide
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
prohibits
california
from
defining
marriage
as
the
union
of
a
man
and
a
woman,
but
the
proponents
who
ask
that
question
do
not
have
standing.
therefore,
as
we
explained
in
our
of
our
precedents,
in
light
of
the
“overriding
and
time
honored
concern
about
keeping
the
judiciary's
power
within
its
proper
constitutional
sphere,
we
must
put
aside
the
natural
urge
to
proceed
directly
to
the
merits
of
this
important
dispute
and
to
settle
it.”
we
have
no
authority
to
consider
the
question
presented
in
this
case
and
neither
did
the
ninth
circuit.
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
thomas,
alito
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
