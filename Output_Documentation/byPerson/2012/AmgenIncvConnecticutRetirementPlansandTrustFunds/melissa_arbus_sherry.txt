ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
by
going
back
to
the
language
of
rule
23
and,
in
particular,
the
predominance
requirement.
the
only
question
is
whether
common
issues
predominate
over
individual
issues.
as
several
of
the
justices
have
recognized,
materiality
is
an
objective
inquiry,
at
least
to
a
common
answer,
and
that
common
answer
unites
the
class
rather
than
divides
it.
if
materiality
is
shown,
the
class
members
can
proceed
together
on
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory.
but--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
the
difference--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
would
disagree
with
that
because
the
difference
is
with
efficiency
and
with
publicity.
if
the
--
depending
on
the
common
answer,
the
class
may
divide.
it
may
fragment
because,
even
if
the
market
is
inefficient,
individual
members
can
make
out
claims
of
direct
reliance.
you
can
rely
on
an
inefficient
market
and
prevail.
you
can
rely
on
nonpublic
statements--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--the
--
the
purpose
of
the
class
certification
stage
with
respect
to
predominance
is
to
weigh
the
common
issues
against
individual
issues.
and
with
respect
to
market
efficiency
--
excuse
me
--
market
efficiency
and
publicity,
those
are
two
matters
that
--
that
either
bind
the
class
together
or
divide
them.
to
the
extent
the
market
is
inefficient,
or
to
the
extent
the
statements
are
not
public,
they
are
not
all
getting
the
information
from
the
same
source.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
but--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
that
is
exactly
right.
and
the
difference
is--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
am
going
to
say
it's
exactly
right,
because
the
confusion
here
is
that
materiality
in
a
fraud-on-the-market
case
serves
two
purposes:
it
is
a
predicate
to
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory,
but
it
is
also
an
independent,
separate
element.
and
what
petitioners
would
have
this
court
do
is
isolate
the
two
inquiries
when
they're
really
the
same
question.
it
is
asking
the
same
question
that
leads
to
the
same
answer,
and
it's
one
that
unites
the
class.
there's
--
petitioners
phrase
the
question
as
whether
reliance--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--the
fraud-on-the-market
theory,
however,
is
a
substantive
theory.
it's
not
a
procedural
doctrine.
to
be
sure,
one
of
the
practical
consequences
is
it
allows
classes
to
be
certified,
but
it's
a
means
of
proving
reliance
in
an
impersonal
market
in
which
investors
trade
today.
what
the
court
did
in
basic
was
adapt
the
direct
reliance
concept
which
envisioned
face-to-face
transactions
to
the
impersonal
market.
and
so
with
respect
to
actually
proving
a
fraud
on
the
market,
you're
absolutely
right,
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
whether
a
fraud
on
the
market
can
be
proven;
we're
talking
about
whether
common
issues
predominate
over
individual
issues.
and
petitioners
still
fail
to
point
to
any
individual
issues
that
would
come
into
play
in
a
case
where
materiality
is
not
able
to
be
shown.
none
would,
because
materiality
would
kill
the
case
for
all.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
with
all
due
respect,
the
two
really
do
collapse
into
one.
once
you've
proven
that
the
market
is
efficient,
and
once
you've
proven
that
the
statements
are
public,
you're
asking
the
same
question.
you
can
call
it
reliance
or
you
can
call
it
materiality.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
no,
i
--
a
couple
responses
to
that.
the
first
one
is
the
one
that
my
colleague
made,
which
is
that
market
efficiency
isn't
disputed
here.
it
was
conceded
in
the
answer
at
paragraph
199.
and
not
only
is
it
not
--
is
it
not
contested
here,
petitioners
actually
--
actually
embrace
an
efficient
market
in
order
to
pursue
their
truth-on-the-market
defense.
and
so
my
first
response
would
be
that's
not
something
to
be
addressed
in
this
case.
and
my
second
response
is
basic
didn't
adopt
any
particular
economic
model
of
market
efficiency.
if
you
look
at
footnote
24
of
basic,
if
you
look
at
footnote
28
of
basic,
the
court
makes
very
clear
that
it's
not
adopting
an
economic
theory
as
far
as
how
quickly
or
completely
the
information
is
incorporated
into
the
market
price.
instead,
it
was
looking
at
congressional
intent.
it
was
looking
at
difficulties
in
direct
proof.
and
it
was
looking
at
common
sense
to
reach
a
result
and
again
to
adapt
a
reliance
theory
that
was
premised
on
face-to-face
transactions
to
the
impersonal
market
that
exists
today.
and
so,
again,
i
wouldn't
consider
market
efficiency
in
this
case.
it's
not
presented.
to
the
extent
there's
questions
about
how
the
determinations
should
be
made
in
terms
of
levels
of
generality,
that's
something
that
the
lower
courts
can
decide.
today,
all
we're
talking
about
is
the
materiality
component
and
again
focusing
on
whether
or
not
common
issues
predominate
over
individual
issues.
it's
a
comparative
inquiry.
it
requires
comparing
common
issues
on
the
one
hand
and
individual
issues
on
the
other.
and
petitioners
have
not
identified
any
individual
issues
that
will
actually
come
into
play
as
the
case
is
litigated.
the
--
going
to
the
--
some
of
the
policy
concerns
that
were
raised,
i'd
make
a
couple
points.
one
is
the
one
that
my
colleague
made.
congress
addressed
those
policy
concerns
in
the
pslra,
in
slusa,
and
it
chose
to
address
them
through
different
means.
the
second
point
i
would
make
is
the
same
argument
could
be
made
with
respect
to
the
other
elements
of
the
securities
fraud
cause
of
action.
if
the
argument
is
you
should
have
to
prove
it
at
class
certification
because
otherwise
the
case
is
going
to
settle,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
scienter,
with
respect
to
falsity,
with
respect
to
loss
causation,
which
this
court
in
erica
john
of
course
did
said
did
not
have
to
be
proven
at
the
class
certification
stage.
so
in
short,
it
proves
too
much.
the
third
response
is
that
there
are
countervailing
policy
concerns
and
there
are
countervailing
concerns
that
are
actually
tethered
to
rule
23
in
terms
of
efficiency.
excuse
me.
petitioners--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--as
a
substantive
matter
on
the
merits,
yes.
it
is
a
predicate.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
in
terms
of
transaction
causation,
what
you're
--
and
reliance
is
referred
to
as
transaction
causation
--
what
you're
trying
to
show
is
whether
or
not
the
information
affected
or
distorted
the
market
price.
and
in
order
to
show
price
distortion,
it
does
require
that
the
information
be
material.
and
so
we
accept
that
in
terms
of
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
--
i
would
say
it's--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
would
make
a
minor
quibble
on
that.
i
would
say
that
the
market
takes
account
of
all
public
information,
but
it
only
--
it
only
moves
based
on
material
information,
so
that's
exactly
right.
and
so
our
issue
is
not
with
the
predicates
for
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory.
our
issue
is
with
petitioners
equating
the
predicate
from
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory
with
the
actual
prerequisites
of
rule
23.
and
this
court
made
it
very
clear
in
shady
grove
that
the
only
question
at
the
rule
23
stage
is
whether
the
prerequisites
have
been
met.
the
only
one
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
predominance.
it's
a
comparative
inquiry
between
common
issues
and
individual
issues.
and
if
i
can
quickly
go
back
to
my
point
about
countervailing
policy
concerns,
as
petitioners
acknowledge,
a
determination
of
the
class
certification
stage
is
not
binding
on
anybody
--
in
that
case
on
the
ultimate
fact-finder,
or
in
any
other
case.
and
so
the
problem
with
petitioners'
position
is
that
it
would
require
relitigation
of
the
materiality
question
at
the
merits
stage
to
the
extent
the
class
is
certified.
or
if
it's
not
in
every
other
case
that
is
brought
on
the
same
issue.
that
doesn't
serve
the
efficiency
purposes
that
underlie
rule
23.
the
--
in
terms
of
absent
class
members,
he
suggests
that
absent
class
members
would
somehow
be
prejudiced,
but
as
your
honor,
justice
kagan,
pointed
out,
the
only
prejudice
is
that
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
relitigate
the
very
same
issue.
that
is
protected
by
allowing
opt
out.
that
is
protected
by
rule
23's
adequacy
of
representation
requirement.
and
so
that's
already
sufficiently
protected.
the
most
efficient
course
is
to
actually
focus
on
common
issues.
materiality
is
a
common
issue.
it
will
result
in
the
same
answer
for
all.
the
class
rises
or
falls
together.
and
class
certification
is
not
about
only
certifying
meritorious
cases.
in
1966,
when
the
current
version
of
rule
23(b)(3)
was
adopted,
it
was
an
innovation.
it
was
a
change
from
the
spurious
class
actions
where
it
was
a
one-way
ratchet,
where
only
the
defendant
was
bound.
in
the
current
rule
of
rule
23(b)(3),
you
want
to
certify
class
actions
that
are
both
meritorious
and
those
that
are
not,
so
it
reaches
a
binding
judgment.
