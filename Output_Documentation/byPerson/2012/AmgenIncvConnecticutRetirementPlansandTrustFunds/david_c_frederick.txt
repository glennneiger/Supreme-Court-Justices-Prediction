mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
class
certification
process
determines
whether
the
case
can
generate
common
answers
for
all
class
members.
so
for
three
reasons--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
is
a
lot
to
said
about
basic,
and
let
me
just
start
the
ball
rolling
by
making
these
observations.
first,
basic
did
not
try
to
distinguish
between
the
requisites
of
rule
23
and
the
substantive
component
of
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory.
and
that's
important,
because
in
that
case
the
court
remanded
for
a
redetermination
of
materiality,
but
it
upheld
the
class
certification
order.
so
in
the
context
of
basic,
the
court
seemed
to
be
thinking
there
was
a
difference
between
what
needed
to
be
proved
for
class
certification
and
what
would
need
to
be
proved
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
now,
the
second
thing
to
be
said
is
that
basic
needs
to
be
read
against
the
backdrop
of
rule
23,
and
especially
this
court's
recent
decision
in
walmart
v.
dukes.
because
materiality
always
generates
a
common
answer
for
all
class
members,
it
is
the
quintessential
common
issue
that
does
not
splinter
the
class
or
cause
it
to
be
noncohesive
for
purposes
of
understanding
predominance.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
only
in
a
hypothetical
case,
justice
kennedy.
and
this
is
the
absolute
most
important
point
that
i
can
try
to
make
today.
in
a
fraud-on-the-market
case,
the
idea
of
reliance,
the
only
theory
of
reliance
that
is
being
advanced,
is
indirect
reliance
on
the
integrity
of
the
market.
there
is
no
other
theory
of
reliance.
why
do
we
know
that
in
this
case?
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
connecticut
retirement
system
could
not
be
the
class
representative
if
it
did
not
meet
the
typicality
requirement
of
rule
23(a),
which
the
district
court
found.
this
is
on
page
25a
of
the
petition
appendix,
and
has
not
been
challenged
subsequently.
but
why
doesn't
connecticut
have
a
direct
reliance
theory?
we
know
they
don't
because
they
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
their
investors
to
apply
whatever
theory
they
have
of
securities
fraud.
so
we
know
in
this
case,
and
this
is
by
far
clear
in
the
run-of-the-mine
fraud-on-the-market
case,
that
the
class
representative
will
only
establish
reliance
indirectly
by
showing
that
the
integrity
of
the
market
was
impaired.
and
so
their
construct
is
an
entirely
hypothetical
and
theoretical
one.
it
simply
does
not
arise
in
the
real
world
of
fraud-on-the-market
cases.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
right,
precisely
because
we
have
to
know
are
all
the
investors
standing
in
the
same
position.
if
the
market
is
efficient
and
it
is
absorbing
information
into
the
price,
all
investors
will
have
the
same
question
with
respect
to
materiality.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
all
lose
on
the
merits
if
there
is
no
materiality.
the
question
about
efficiency,
justice
scalia,
and
the
reason
why
it
is
advanced
at
class
certification
is
because
it
serves
a
gatekeeping
role
in
determining
whether
all
the
investors
can
show
indirect
reliance
on
the
market.
if
the
--
if
the
stock
is
thinly
traded,
there
are
no
public
analysts,
there
are
no
stock
reports
given
about
it,
and
no
one
knows
exactly
why
is
the
price
being
determined,
that
creates
exactly
the
kind
of
individual
issues
that
would
predominate
in
a
securities
fraud
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
the
question
is,
does
efficiency
serve
as
a
means
of
determining
are
all
the
investors
similarly
situated?
are
they
a
cohesive
class?
if
the
market
is
not
efficient,
and
mind
you,
they
conceded
this
question
in
their
answer
and
they
did
not
challenge
the
expert
that
was
put
into
this
report
on
the
question
of
efficiency,
so
that
question's
really
not
in
this
case.
but
in
the
case
that
you're
hypothesizing,
justice
scalia,
efficiency
serves
the
gatekeeping
function
of
determining
are
all
the
investors
similarly
situated
so
that
indirect
reliance
can
be
a
--
a
method
of
showing
that
predicate
for
a
common
answer
to
be
determined
at
trial.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
publicity
serves
the
same
function.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
it
--
where
it
gets
appropriately
done
is
the
adequacy
and
typicality
prongs
of
rule
23(a),
because
that
person
has
a
different
factual
basis
for
attempting
to
assert
a
securities
fraud,
and
that
person
is
not
typical
of
the
class
and
so
therefore
would
not
meet
the
typicality
requirement
of
23(a).
now,
it
is
possible,
certainly,
that
in
other
cases
there
might
be
investors
out
there
who
do
have
a
direct
reliance
theory,
but
they
are
protected
by
rule
23
in
a
couple
of
ways.
one
is
they
can
bring
their
own
case,
and
they
can
say,
i
directly
relied
on
amgen's
misstatements
and
the
false
things
that
they
said
about
their
flagship
products
and
i
therefore
have
my
own
10b-5
case,
or
if
the
class
is
certified
and
they
think
they
have
a
direct
reliance
theory,
they
can
opt
out
of
the
class.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
my
direct
answer
to
that
is
that
materiality
still
serves
as
a
common
answer.
all
the
investors
are
going
to
lose
if
it
is
not
a
material
misstatement
that
has
any
effect,
and
they
will
win
or
they
will
have
the
potential
to
win
if
it
is
a
material--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--right.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
issue
that
you
want
to
decide
or
you
think
that
you
want
to
decide
is
what
constitutes
the
efficiency
of
the
market,
and
that
is
a
hotly
litigated
issue
in
many
securities
cases.
it
just
happens
not
to
be
at
issue
in
this
one.
and
so
the
question
of,
you
know,
you've
got
a
fortune
200
company
with
1.1
billion
shares
outstanding,
nine
million
traded
a
day
during
the
class
period.
i
mean,
this
is
a
hugely
efficient
market
for
the
stock
that
is
at
issue
before
you.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
right.
what
you're
ending
up
doing,
justice
breyer,
is
you
are
front
loading.
you
are
having
a
mini
trial
on
the
merits,
because
the
materiality
question
here
goes
into
what
did
the
executives
think
and
mean
when
they
were
making
certain
statements
about
clinical
trials
for
their
drug.
what
was--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
is
--
because
it
is
a
common
question,
it
is
not
one
to
be
decided
at
class
certification.
just
like
falsity--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
efficiency
and
publicity
are
gate-keeping
functions
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
answer
for
indirect
reliance
on
the
market
is
a
common
question.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it's
a
new
concoction
they
have
not
argued
before
this
stage
of
the
briefing
in
this
case,
and
it's
wrong
because
all
investors
will
rise
or
fall
based
on
whether
or
not
those
statements
that
may
have
some
subsidiary
materiality
effect
are
going
to
be
able
to
show
that
there
was
some
consequence
to
the
market.
and
it
is
that
why
--
that
is
why
it
is
still
a
common
question,
even
if
there
are
the
subsidiary
inefficiencies--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
and
congress
recognized
that
there
were
issues
concerning
these
various
elements.
and
that's
why,
in
1995,
when
it
enacted
the
pslra,
it
addressed
scienter
by
imposing
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
and
loss
causation,
but
it
was
asked
to
address
materiality
and
reliance
and
it
chose
not
to.
the
first
bill
that
was
proposed
would
have
dealt
with
basic,
and
the
--
and
the
congress
voted
that
down,
and
instead--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
scalia,
you
would
consign
district
court
judges
to
having
many
trials
on
the
merits
because
the
fact
that
materiality
is
such
a
highly
contextual
inquiry--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--true.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
but
that's
where
efficiency
comes
in,
justice
kennedy,
and
that's
why,
when
efficiency
is
contested
at
the
class
certification
stage,
what
comes
in
are
proofs
of
does
information
end
up
having
an
effect?
and
economists
do
event
studies
to
try
to
show
the
general
level
at
which
information
will
be
absorbed
into
the
market
price.
that's
where
that
issue
gets
contested.
it
does
not
get
contested
on
the
question
of
materiality,
because
materiality
looks
at
the
total
mix
of
information
that
would
be
relevant
to
an
investor,
not--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
efficiency
question
goes
into
the
individual
stock's
ability
to
absorb
information,
both
material
and
nonmaterial
information.
now,
the
question
on
the
merits,
for
which
all
investors
will
either
rise
or
fall
together,
is
was
this
company's
misrepresentation
a
material
one
to
the
reasonable
investor?
and
that's
why
all
investors
are
going
to
have
this
same
answer,
because
it's
the
same
objective
inquiry.
the
question
that
you
--
you
and
justice
scalia
are
positing
about
the
efficiency
of
the
market
is
one
on
which
there
are
disagreements
among
the
lower
courts
as
to
how
to
challenge
and
how
to
deal
with
that
question,
but
they
do
not
do
it
on
the
basis
of
materiality.
judge
easterbrook
had
a
very
sound
opinion
in
the
schleicher
case
in
which
he
goes
through
and
he
explains
that
when
there
is
a
fraud
on
the
market
case,
the
notion
of
indirect
reliance,
where
efficiency
is
established,
really
evolves
--
devolves
down
to
the
core
merits
question
of
materiality.
and
that
is
a
common
question
that
--
in
which
all
of
the
investors
are
going
to
rise
together.
but
i
do
want
to
end
by
saying
that,
when
congress
looked
at
this
question,
it
decided
not
to
deal
with
this
question
of
efficiency
or
materiality.
it
was
faced
with
a
specter
of
300
lawsuits
being
filed
per
year
that
were
securities
fraud
cases,
in
1995,
where
a
93
percent
settlement
rate
was
occurring,
an
average
settlement
of
nearly
$9
million.
in
2011
the
statistics
showed
that
what
congress
did
was
successful
in
achieving
the
purpose
congress
attained.
in
the
year
2011,
there
were
188
class
actions
filed;
50
percent
of
them
were
dismissed
mostly
on
the
high-end
pleading
standards
that
congress
had
enacted
in
the
pslra.
so
it's
not
really
for
this
court's
province
to
be
imposing
policy
judgments
about
what
additional
requirements
ought
to
be
put
on
23(b)(3);
congress
made
that
judgment.
and
these
proceedings
that
have
gone
along
in
--
in
this
way
were
perfectly
sound
by
--
with
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions?
