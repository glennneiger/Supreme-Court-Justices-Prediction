so
is
the
falsity
of
the
statement
common
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
an
individual
who
has
--
it
has
been
deemed
in
--
in
a
cert
certification
that
an
issue
is
immaterial,
could
an
individual
claimant
ever
prove
it's
material?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
on
the
truth-on-the-market
--
the
truth-on-the-market
defense,
which
is
the
type
of
defense
that
you're
raising
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
could
that
be--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
don't
you
answer
the
question
that
was
asked
earlier,
if
basic
set
forth
a
presumption,
and
are
you
disputing
that
at
the
class
certification
stage
a
defendant
can
prove
that
the
market
is
inefficient?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
shouldn't
we
hold
basic
to
its
position
that
all
of
its
presumptions
can
be
rebutted
as
well,
not
just
efficiency?
why
do
we
set
out
efficiency
as
the
one
issue
that
can
be
rebutted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
we--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
we
get
a
hypothetical
that
i
actually
think
could
occur,
which
is
not
a
truth-on-the-market
defense,
but
a
known
truth
to
the
individual
person
seeking
certification.
so
that
is,
it's
immaterial
to
that
person
because
they
were
told
this
information
by
someone
and
still
trading.
would
that
defense
be
available
at
certification?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
earlier,
so
is
efficiency
or
nonefficiency.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
--
that
differentiation,
articulating
it
that
way,
doesn't
move
the
ball.
