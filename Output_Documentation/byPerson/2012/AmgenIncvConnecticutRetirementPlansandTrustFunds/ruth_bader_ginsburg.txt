i
thought
we
were
talking
about,
mr.
waxman,
the
materiality
of
the
alleged
misstatement;
and
i
am
really
nonplussed
by
your
answer
that
if
the
judge
says
it's
immaterial,
that
doesn't
end
it
for
everybody.
certainly
it
ends
it
for
the
class;
you
said
that.
should
it
also
end
it
for
the
representative
of
the
class
to
say:
okay,
now
i'm
going
to
come
back,
and
this
statement,
this
finding
of
the
immateriality
doesn't
bind
me.
of
course
it's
going
to
bind
the
class
representative.
so
if
it's
immaterial,
the
case
ends.
and
if
it
is
material,
then
it
is
material
to
everybody
in
the
class.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
waxman--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
there
is
no
question
about
23(a),
right?
the
23(a)
prerequisites
have
been
satisfied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
thing
is
(b)(3),
that
is
a
question
of
law
or
fact
common
to
the
class
members
predominates
over
questions
affecting
only
individual
members.
the
question
that
predominates
is
the
question
of
were
these
representations
material;
if
they
were
material,
then
the
certification
is
proper.
if
they
were
immaterial,
it's
not.
it's
just
--
i
don't
understand
why
this
isn't
just
a
clear
case
of
a
question
common
to
the
class;
that
is,
the
question
of
materiality.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
the
--
the
basic
opinion
that
started
all
this
off,
on
page
242,
lists
materiality
as
a
common
question.
the
materiality
of
the
misrepresentation,
if
any,
is
listed
as
a
common
question,
and
that
made
perfect
sense
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
waxman,
you
seem
to
be
setting
out
two
determinations
of
materiality.
you
say
in
order
to
certify
the
class
you
have
to
show
that
the
misrepresentation
was
material.
and
in
order
to
win
on
the
merits,
you
certainly
have
to
show
that
the
misrepresentation
was
material.
how
do
those
two
findings
of
materiality
differ?
how
does
the
finding
that
you
say
must
be
made
at
the
certification
stage
differ
from
the
finding
that
must
be
made
at
the
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
still
--
what
does
“
material
”
mean
at
the
trial
level,
what
does
“
material
”
mean
at
the
certification
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
the
same
question.
it
has
to
be
--
if
it's
established
at
the
certification
stage,
it
has
to
be
established
again
at
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
you
say
--
you
say,
you
point
out
quite
rightly
that
the
efficiency
of
the
market
was
conceded
--
was
conceded
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
not
challenged.
except
that
now,
in
amgen's
brief,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
the
efficiency
of
the
market
is
a
more
sophisticated
question.
and
it's
not
my
note
--
binary,
i
think
is
what
they
said
--
it
isn't
that
it's
either
efficient
or
it's
not
efficient;
it
depends
on
other
factors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
sounds
like
you
are
saying
you
have
to
win
on
the
merits
of
the
materiality
question
in
order
to
get
the
class
certified.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
involves
a
securities-fraud
complaint
filed
by
connecticut
retirement
plans
against
biotechnology
company,
amgen
and
several
of
amgen's
officers.
to
gain
class-action
certification
on
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23,
connecticut
retirement
invoked
the
"fraud-on-the-market"
doctrine
endorsed
by
this
court
in
a
1988
decision,
basic
v.
levinson
and
recognized
most
recently
in
the
2011
decision
erica
p.
john
fund
v.
halliburton.
the
fraud-on-the-market
premise
is
if
the
price
of
a
security
treated
in
an
efficient
market
will
reflect
all
publicly
available
information
about
a
company.
accordingly,
a
buyer
of
the
security
maybe
presumed
to
have
relied
on
that
information
in
purchasing
the
security.
amgen
has
conceded
the
efficiency
of
the
market
for
the
securities
had
issued
and
has
not
contested
the
public
character
of
the
fraudulent
statements
alleged
in
connecticut
retirement's
complaint.
nor
does
amgen
hear
dispute
that
connecticut
retirement
meets
all
four
of
the
class-action
prerequisites
stated
in
rule
23
(a).
rule
23
(b)(3)
states
an
additional
requirement
for
class-action
certification
in
a
suit
for
damages.
that
requirement
is
center
stage
in
this
case.
it
reads,
“the
questions
of
law
or
fact
common
to
the
class
members
must
predominate
over
any
questions
affecting
only
individual
members.”
to
meet
this
predominance
requirement,
amgen
contends,
“connecticut
retirement
must
do
more
than
plausibly
plead
that
amgen's
misrepresentations
materially
affected
the
price
of
amgen's
stock.”
“certification
must
be
denied,”
amgen
asserts,
unless
connecticut
retirement
actually
proves
materiality
at
the
threshold
stage
of
the
case.
the
district
court
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
the
argument.
a
proof
of
materiality
must
be
made
prior
to
class-action
certification.
we
intern
affirm
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment.
connecticut
retirement
must
have
caused
prove
materiality
in
order
to
prevail
on
the
merits
of
its
securities-fraud
suit,
but
that
proof
need
not
be
made
prior
to
class-action
certification.
rule
23
(b)(3)
says
that
questions
common
to
the
class
must
predominate.
it
does
not
require
that
those
questions
be
answered
on
the
merits
in
favor
of
the
class.
materiality
is
judged
according
to
an
objective
standard.
it
can
be
proved
by
evidence
common
to
the
class.
therefore,
materiality
presents
a
common
question
within
the
meaning
of
rule
23
(b)(3).
if
the
class
representative,
hear
connecticut
retirement,
fails
to
show
materiality
at
the
merit
stage,
that
hardly
means
that
individual
questions
will
predominate
instead
because
materiality
is
an
essential
element
of
the
securities-fraud
claim,
the
suit
will
fail
and
its
entirety.
in
short,
the
class
is
highly
cohesive,
its
members
will
succeed
or
lose
unison
and
no
event
will
the
individual
circumstances
of
particular
class
members
matter.
essentially,
amgen
would
have
us
put
the
court
before
the
course
before
certifying
a
securities-fraud
class-action
under
rule
23
(b)(3),
amgen
argues.
a
district
court
must
first
determine
whether
the
class
will
win
the
fray.
but
the
office
of
rule
23
(b)(3)
is
not
to
get
the
case
adjudicated
rather
it
is
to
select
the
method
best
suited
for
adjudication
of
the
controversy
fairly
and
efficiently.
here,
that
method
is
the
class-action
connecticut
retirement
seeks
demand.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
there
are
two
dissenting
opinions,
one
by
justice
scalia
and
the
other
by
justice
thomas
with
whom
justice
kennedy
joins
in
full
and
justice
scalia
joins
in
all
by
part
1-b.
