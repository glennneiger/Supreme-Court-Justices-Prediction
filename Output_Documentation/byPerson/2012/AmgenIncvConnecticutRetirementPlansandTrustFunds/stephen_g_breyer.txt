or
you
can
take
exactly
what
you
said
and
phrase
it
the
opposite
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
wouldn't,
but
i
suspect
your
opponents
might.
that
if
it's
the
purpose
of
the
certification
stage
to
try
out
every
element
of
liability
at
that
stage
rather
than
waiting
for
the
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's
not.
good.
now,
once
you
say
that,
what
you
have
said
is,
you
know,
it
could
still
be
material
for
some
individual,
even
though
there
is
no
market
reliance.
and
similarly,
a
silence
going
[indicating,]
some
odd
set
of
words
or
whatever
it
is,
although
it's
not
false
for
almost
anybody,
for
some
particular
person
it
could
seem
--
convey
something
false
in
some
particular
set
of
circumstances.
so
let's
try
out
falsity
at
the
certification
stage,
too.
in
fact,
let's
try
out
everything,
because
we
could
always
think
of
a
few
examples
where,
despite
the
fact
that,
you
know,
that
it's
only
a
common
issue
99
percent
of
the
time,
we
can
dream
up
a
situation
where
it's
not
a
common
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
you
are
saying
with
a
cert
--
class
certification
here,
if
there
is
no
materiality
there
is
no
class;
and
you
are
repeatedly
faced
with
the
question:
you
are
absolutely
right;
in
fact
there
is
no
case.
and
so
then
what
you
say
is,
and
indeed
i
have
a
few
instances
here
in
which
there
could
be
a
case,
and
i
would
say
i
bet
if
we
are,
you
know,
professorial
enough,
we
could
dream
up
a
hypothetical
for
anything,
where
there
still
is
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
true,
but
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
work
out
what,
as
i
understand
it
now,
mr.
waxman's
point
is
--
is
basically
this,
that
--
that
why
do
we
use
an
efficient
market
theory?
we
use
it
because
if
the
market
is
efficient
and
the
statement
is
public,
then
someone
who
bought
over
the
market
is
buying
in
a
--
in
a
world
that
reflects
the
false
statement.
i
mean,
that's
--
so
he
--
there
was
sufficient
reliance
indirectly.
all
right.
so
i
think
his
point
is,
yes,
i
can
see
materiality
is
something
that's
relevant
to
everybody.
of
course
it
is,
a
common
issue
in
the
case.
but
also
it
is
a
feature
of
materiality
that
if
it
wasn't
material,
then
our
theory
of
market
reliance
--
market
--
efficient
markets
goes
out
the
window,
because
you
can
have
all
the
efficiency
in
the
world,
all
the
publicity
in
the
world,
but
still
where
something
to
a
reasonable
stockbroker
is
irrelevant,
his
reaction
is
“
who
cares
”?
and
therefore,
although
there
could
be
special
cases,
the
efficient
market
theory
plays
no
role.
now,
i
think
that's
what
his
theory
is,
if
i
understand
it.
and
--
and
i
don't
hope
it
is
if
i've
got
it
--
i
mean,
i
hope
i
got
it
right.
but
--
but
if
that
--
so
what's
your
direct
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you're
saying
in
this
kind
of
case,
the
--
the
materiality
or
not
is
not
likely
to
be
specially
sufficient
--
specially
significant.
in
fact,
you
are
going
to
decide
if
it
is
a
common
issue,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
import
that
common
issue
into
the
preliminary
finding,
even
if
what
i
just
parroted,
we
hope
is
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
if
i've
got
this,
your
answer
--
which
i
am
trying
to
follow
it;
don't
tell
me
i'm
right
if
i'm
not
--
that
with
efficiency
of
the
market,
that's
not
a
traditional
element
of
a
tort--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
is
something
special
to
get
into
this
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
publicity
of
the
matter,
that
is
not
traditionally
a
common
element
of
the
tort,
that
is
something
special
to
get
into
this
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
materiality,
it
is
a
common
element
of
the
tort
always;
it
is
traditionally
there;
it
will
be
litigated,
so
there
is
no
special
reason
to
or
desirability
in
or
need
for
litigating
at
the
outset.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
preconditions
--
there
are
preconditions,
not
related
to
the
merits,
that
do,
in
fact,
justify
the
use
of
a
special
reliance
theory.
now
i've
said
that;
of
course,
so
is
materiality.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
materiality,
unlike
the
other
two,
is
part
of
the
element
of
the
basic
case
where
it
is
a
common
issue
in
this
case
--
and
in
most
--
to
everybody.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
exactly
right?
because
i
am
getting
the
--
facing
the
problem
a
few
minutes
from
now
somebody
is
going
to
say:
well,
why
is
that
exactly
right?
i
mean,
it
is
a
precondition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
traditionally,
how
did
that
work?
how
did
that
work
traditionally?
no
class,
okay?
joe
--
farmer
jones
comes
in,
you
have
to
show
it's
false?
you
have
to
show
it's
material,
and
then
you
show
the
reliance
that
he
did
something
on
that
basis--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
the
materiality
was
not
part
of
reliance.
materiality
was
an
element
that
was
always
proved,
and
then
you
went
on
to
show
reliance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
reason
that
we
want
to
prove
it
upfront
in
the
23
rather
than
wait
till
the
merits,
where
it
will
be
argued
anyway
in
exactly
the
same
way
--
the
reason
that
we
want
to
do
it
first
is
since
it's
going
to
be
there
anyway
and
going
to
be
litigated
anyway,
unlike
publicity,
unlike
efficiency.
but
the
reason
we
take
this
one
and
run
it
upfront
is?
and
it
can't
be
the
answer
we
should
litigate
everything
before
we
litigate
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
--
so
what's
the
answer?
