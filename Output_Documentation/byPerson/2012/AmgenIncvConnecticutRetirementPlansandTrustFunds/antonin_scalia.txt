mr.
waxman,
you
have
a
habit
of
not
pausing
between
sentences.
you
pause
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence,
and
you
end
a
sentence
and
go
right
on
to
the
next.
so
i
apologize
for
interrupting
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
leave
me
no
alternative.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
not
the
case
that
one
of
the
other
elements
necessary
for
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory
would
also
be
decided
conclusively
for
future
individual
litigants,
namely
the
efficiency
of
the
market?
a
future
litigant
will
ordinarily
claim:
i
either
sold
it
at
a
depressed
price
or
bought
it
at
an
inflated
price
because
of
the
market's
reaction
to
this
particular
fraudulent
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
the
efficiency
of
the
--
of
the
market
being
determined
in
this
preliminary
question
as
you
can
say
about
--
about
the
issue
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
you
--
you
say
that,
you
know,
it's
a
flukey
hypothetical
where
--
where
the
--
the
issue
here
would
--
would
come
up
again
in
a
different
context
in
an
individual
suit.
let
--
let
me
give
you
a
--
a
case
that's
not
flukey
and
hypothetical.
that
is,
it
is
usually
the
case
that
people
who
are
allegedly
defrauded
in
stocks
rely
upon
the
fact
that
they
bought
it
at
an
--
at
an
inflated
price
or
sold
it
at
a
depressed
price.
both
of
those
questions
depend
upon
the
efficiency
of
the
market.
if
the
market
is
not
efficient,
a
question
that
has
to
be
decided
for
the
class
certification
case,
the
individual
investor
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
say,
you
know,
that's
--
that's
why
i
got
cheated,
because
the
market
reflected
this
false
statement
and
i
paid
more
money
for
the
stock
than
i
should
have.
that
--
that
is
not
a
flukey
hypothetical.
that
is
what
will
happen
in
most
individual
cases.
and
yet,
that
question
of
the
efficiency
of
the
market
has
to
be
decided
at
the
class
certification
stage.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
about
materiality.
if
it's
immaterial,
it
isn't
reflected
in
--
in
the
market.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
the
difference
you
assert
is
that,
with
respect
to
the
issue
here,
it
will
be
an
issue
in
all
individual
cases,
whereas
with
regard
to
the
efficiency
of
the
market
it
will
only
be
an
issue
in
what,
95
percent
of
--
of
the
individual
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
--
the
issue
is
not
whether
--
whether
it's
a
common
question
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
is
whether
there's
any
reason
to
believe
that
the
--
that
the
market
reflects
reality.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
is
--
there
is
a
reason
for
deciding
it
earlier,
and
the
reason
is
the
--
the
enormous
pressure
to
settle
once
the
class
is
certified.
in
most
cases,
that's
the
end
of
the
lawsuit.
there's
--
there's
automatically
a
settlement.
now,
one
way
of
--
of
certifying
the
class
is
to
show,
well,
you
know,
it's
an
efficient
market
and
you
can
presume
that
everybody
in
the
class
relied
on
the
market.
but
that's
only
true
if
--
if
the
--
the
statement
was
material
to
the
market.
if
it
was
immaterial
to
the
market,
that
isn't
true.
and
you
should
not
proceed
any
further,
and
you
should
not
begin
this
--
this
class
action
which,
in
most
cases,
is
simply
the
preliminary
to
a
settlement.
there
is
a
good
reason
for
deciding
it
sooner.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
difference
between
100
percent
and
95
percent?
i
mean,
most
of
the
other
claims
in
--
in
stock
cases
are
going
to
be
based
on
what
--
what
the
market
price
was
when
the
person
bought
or
sold.
so,
you
know,
95
percent
instead
of
100
percent,
that's
--
that's
the
basic
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
have
the
same
question,
then
maybe
we
shouldn't
have
this
fraud-on-the-market
theory.
because
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
--
is
to
--
to
assume
that
--
that
the
whole
class
was
--
was
damaged
and
relied
--
because
you
can
rely
on
an
efficient
market.
but
you
can
only
rely
on
an
efficient
market
where
there
has
been
a
material
misrepresentation.
so
maybe
we
should
overrule
basic
because
it
was
certainly
based
upon
a
theory
that
--
that
simply
collapses
once
you
remove
the
materiality
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
materiality
is
a
common
issue.
reliance
is
only
a
common
issue
if
you
accept
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory.
that's
the
problem.
and
you
are
using
the
one,
which
is
a
common
issue,
to
leapfrog
into
the
second,
to
make
the
efficiency
of
the
market
reasoning
something
that
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
to
put
it
differently,
an
efficient
market
is
a
market
that
takes
account
of
material
factors,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
an
efficient
market
if
it's,
you
know
--
it's,
who
knows,
random?
it
takes
account
of
material
factors.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
don't
have
to
prove
it
to
get
the
class
certified.
you
only
have
to
prove
it
to
get
the
class
certified
with
the
benefit
of
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
a
shortcut
to
getting
the
class
certified,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
is
just
a
condition
to
the
shortcut.
