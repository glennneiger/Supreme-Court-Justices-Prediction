chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-1085,
amgen,
incorporated
v.
the
connecticut
retirement
plans
and
trust
funds.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
the
case?
i
would
suppose
if
there's
no
materiality,
that
means
that
the
effect
on
the
market
price
just
happens
to
be
zero.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
that
common
to
all
parties?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
at
certification
you
just
assume
that
materiality
--
you
don't
have
to
show
it.
if
it's
always
a
common
question,
you
assume
it
in
trying
to
weigh
out
the
number
of
--
whether
or
not
common
issues
predominate
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
you
may.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
sherry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
you
have
to
show
materiality
to
rely
on
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory
to
establish
reliance?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
that
is.
if
you're
trying
to
show
reliance,
and
you
show
that
it's
an
efficient
market,
and
that
the
information
was
--
was
public,
doesn't
that
show
reliance
without
regard
to
whether
the
statement's
material
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1085,
amgen
versus
ct
retirement
plans
&
trust
funds.
