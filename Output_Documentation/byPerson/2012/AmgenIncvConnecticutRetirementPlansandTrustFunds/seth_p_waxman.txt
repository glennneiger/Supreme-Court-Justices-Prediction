mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
case
is
about
whether
the
claim
of
liability
is
in
a
fundamental
sense
class
wide
or
individual.
the
heart
of
a
10b-5
claim
is,
i
bought
or
sold
in
reliance
on
a
misleading
statement.
the
question
at
the
class
cert
stage
is
whether
each
individual
will
have
to
prove
his
own
reliance
directly
on
the
statement,
or
whether
every
--
he
can
prove
indirectly
reliance
on
the
statement
by
showing
that
everybody
relied
on
a
distorted
market
price.
a
market
price
will
reflect
a
statement
if
and
only
if
the
statement
is
material
and
is
made
publicly
on
an
efficient
market.
so,
absent
materiality,
the
market
price
cannot
be
presumed
to
reflect
the
statement
in
question.
and
the
plaintiffs--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
exactly
correct.
and
the
point
here
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--mr.
chief
justice,
every
one
of
the
four
predicates
to
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory,
which
is
a
shortcut
that
--
that
excuses
plaintiffs
from
proving
that
i
heard
the
statement
and
relied
on
it
--
every
one
of
those
predicates
is
common.
whether
the
market
is
efficient
is
common.
whether
the
statement
is
public
is
common.
whether
the
stocks
were
bought
and
sold
during
the
period
of
market
distortion
is
common.
and
materiality
is
common.
the
question
is
not
whether--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
falsity
of
the
statement
is
common,
but
it
is
not
a
predicate
to
whether
or
not
you
can
prove
reliance
on
a
statement
indirectly
by
relying
on
the
integrity
of
the
market
price,
because
in
an
efficient
market,
material
public
statements,
whether
they
are
true
or
false,
will
presumably
move
the
market
price.
and
if
you're
trying
to
prove
reliance
on
a
false--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--sure.
i'm
not
arguing--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
either
way.
let
me
explain
why.
there's
no
doubt
that
this
court's
standard
for
materiality
announced
in
tsc
v.
northway,
and
since
reiterated,
is
an
objective
standard.
it
doesn't
depend
on
who
the
relier
was.
but
the
inability
to
prove
to
a
certifying
judge
that
class-wide
reliance
can
be
--
that
class-wide
reliance
exists
because
the
statement
was
material
doesn't
preclude
a
plaintiff
like
connecticut
retirement,
which
has
said
it's
going
to
proceed
whether
there's
a
class
or
not,
or
any
other
member
of
the
class,
from
coming
to
court
and
saying
either,
"i
directly
relied
on
this
statement
and
here's
my
proof
that
it's
material
to
the
trier-of-fact.
"
because
the
decision
that
the
judge
makes
at
certification
is
not
binding
on
the
trier-of-fact;
or
even
to
say,
"i
relied
on
the
integrity
of
the
market
price,
and
i
have
proof
that
the
market
price
was
affected
because
here
are
three
investors,
they're
all
reasonable
people,
and
they
say
that
it
was
relevant,
important
to
them
in
the
total
mix
of
information
involved.
"
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
suit
cannot
--
that
is,
the
suit
cannot
proceed
as
a
class
action.
connecticut
retirement,
or
any--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
--
i
think
that's
wrong.
i
think
that's
conceptually
wrong,
justice
kagan,
in
the
sense
that
all
that
the
class
certification
decision
says
is
that
the
putative
class
representative
can
sue
on
his
own
behalf,
but
he
can't
drag
everybody
else
into
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
want
to
--
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
the
question
of
why
whether,
even
if
your
--
the
premise
of
your
question
is
correct,
it
doesn't
matter
for
this
case.
but
let
me
take
one
more
run
at
--
at
your
premise.
the
next
thing
that
would
happen
if
i'm
right,
presumably,
and
the
case
isn't
over,
the
class
just
isn't
certified,
is
that
defendant,
you
know,
emboldened
by
the
judge's
rule,
will
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
materiality
--
the
element
of
the
substantive
offense,
not
materiality,
the
predicate
to
class
certification
--
has
just
been
determined
in
favor
of
me.
that
is
a
very
different
question
for
the
court.
materiality,
as
this
court
has
said,
is
fact-sensitive,
and
it
involves
a
balancing
of
credibility
of
witnesses
or
of
expert
opinions,
and
the
judge
at
the
--
at
the
class
cert
stage
has
to
find
facts
and
has
to
make
a
ruling.
when
it
comes
up
on
summary
judgment,
what
the
--
if
there
is
a
dispute
of
material
facts,
what
the
judge
should
do
under
the
law
is
to
say:
look,
i
just
held
that
i
didn't
think
it
was
material,
but
i
resolved
disputed
material
facts,
and
that's
for
the
jury,
and
this
case
will
go
to
the
jury.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
in
some
cases
if
--
if
the
alleged
fact
is,
you
know,
that
amgen's
president
got
a
haircut
at
10:30,
the
judge
presumably
can
say
there
are
--
you
know,
this
is
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
the
vast
majority
of
cases
--
this
is
a
perfect
example
--
where
they
have
statements
that
in
the
abstract,
extracted
from
the
total
mix
of
information,
look
pretty
material.
these
are
flagship
drugs.
on
the
other
hand,
the
evidence
we
wanted
to
introduce
and
the
judge
wouldn't
hear
because
in
the
ninth
circuit
the
test
is
not
proving
facts,
but
simply
alleging
them--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
judge
at
the
class
certification
stage
is
required
to
weigh
competing
evidence
and
--
and
render
his
or
her
best
judgment.
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
a
judge
is
precluded
from
doing
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
no,
no.
the
--
the
class
certification
stage
requires
the
moving
party,
the
putative
--
the
--
the
class
representative
who
is
proposing
to
arrogate
to
himself
and
his
method
of
proof
the
fortunes
of
all
the
absent
class
members,
whether
they
are
direct
reliers
or
indirect
reliers,
tie
their
fortunes
to
his
fortune
at
trial.
and
the
judge
simply
has
to
say:
is
this
a
case
in
which
reliance
is
a
common
issue?
that
is
the
key
through
the
certification
gate
in
10b-5
cases.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
ginsburg,
let's
take
an
easier
case.
let's
say
i'm
somebody
who
bought
amgen
during
the
relevant
period,
and
they
--
the
judge
says,
you
know,
i've
heard
your
--
i've
considered
your
event
studies
and
i
think
this
is
--
information
isn't
material.
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
that
precludes
me
from
bringing
a
suit
and
saying,
here's
my
evidence
of
--
i
directly
relied;
here's
my
evidence
of
materiality.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
standard
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you
are
--
you
are
either
right
or
wrong,
depending
on
how
i
understood
you.
let
me--
[laughter]
let
me
start
with
you're
right,
justice
kennedy,
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
materiality
--
the
quirk
of
this
case
is
that
materiality
is
both,
as
all
my
friends
on
the
other
side
agree,
an
essential
predicate
of
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory,
that
is
the
essential
predicate
of
the
ability
to
prove
indirect
reliance
on
the
statement
through
an
assertion
that
the
market
price
--
that
the
statement
distorted
the
market
price.
everyone
agrees
that
if
the
statement
isn't
material,
it
didn't
distort
the
market
price,
and
therefore
reliance
is
an
individualized
issue
for
those
who
actually
heard
and
detrimentally
relied
on
the
statement.
one
of
the
elements
that
has
to
be
proven
in
a
10b-5
case
is
reliance,
which
is
what
we
were
talking
about
on
the
class
cert
stage,
and
there
materiality
is
a
predicate
for
reliance.
but
even
if
reliance
is
proven,
materiality
is
also
an
element
of
a
10b-5(b)
cause
of
action,
and
the
standard
for
materiality
is
the
same.
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
what
is
the
purpose
of
rule
23?
if
you
think
that
the
purpose
of
rule
23
is
to
postpone
to
the
merits
everything
that
can
be
postponed
without
a
risk
of
foreclosing
valid
individual
claims,
we
lose.
but
that's
not
the
purpose.
the
purpose
is
for
a
court
to
determine
whether
all
of
the
preconditions
for
forcing
everyone
into
a
class
action
are
present
before
you
certify.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
i
wouldn't.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
breyer,
the
point
of
class
certification
is
not
to
pre-try
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
point
of
the
class
certification,
as
this
court
explained
in
amchem
and
other
cases,
and
as
the
rules
advisory
committee
notes,
is
the
question
of
whether
there
is
class
coherence
in
the
first
place.
it's
not
the
merits
issue.
it's
whether
it's
fair
for
the
class
representative
to
impose
on
the
defendant
the
juggernaut
of
class
action
and
on
the
absent
class
members
their
fortunes
in
his
or
her
hands.
and
what--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kagan,
this
court
has
explained
more
than
once,
and
i
am
now
quoting
from
amchem,
that
“
class
”
--
"it
is
class
cohesion
and
only
class
cohesion
that
legitimizes
representative
action
in
the
first
place.
"
and
that
question,
quote,
"preexists
any
settlement
and
therefore
any
fortiori
any
litigation.
"
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
--
there
is
class
--
with
respect,
there
is
class
cohesion,
investors
cohere
into
a
class,
only
when
the
alleged
misinformation
was
significant
enough
to
affect
the
price,
thus
enabling
the
common
claim
of
relying
on
the
misinformation
in
the
same
way.
letting
a
putative
representative
through
the
certification
gate
without
showing
that
key
is
like,
on
a
theory
of
no
harm,
no
foul,
because
we
will
all
lose
together--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--is
like
letting--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
challenged
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
question
at
the
class
certification
stage,
the
predominance
question
is
the
reliance
element,
not
the
materiality
element.
everyone
agrees
that
materiality,
like
falsity,
like
scienter,
like
loss
causation,
are
all
common
questions.
as
this
court
explained
in
basic
and
reiterated
last
term
in
halliburton,
in
10b-5
actions,
the
question
at
class
certification
is
whether
reliance
needs
to
be
proven
directly;
that
is,
individually
by
people
who
heard
and
acted
in
response;
or
whether
the
shortcut
that
this
court
authorized
in
basic
of
allowing
indirect
proof
by
proving
that
the
statement
caused
a
distortion
of
the
market,
is
the
way
to
go.
there
are
two
tracks,
and
it
happens
in
this
case
that
materiality
is
both
an
element
which
is
common
and
a
predicate
to
class-wide
reliance.
everyone
agrees
that
you
can't
rely
as
a
class
on
the
--
the
challenged
misstatement
unless
the
statement
moved
or
had
the
capability
of
moving
the
market
price,
and
that's
why
the
materiality
is
the
glue
that
holds--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
at
all.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's
the
red
light.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
purity.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
absolutely
right.
and
the
same
is
true
for
public
statement.
the
way
that
the
government
in
responding--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
not
correct,
and
in
any
event,
that
analysis,
that
approach
is,
as
i
was
trying
to
say,
is
like
letting
the
fruits
justify
the
search.
the
question
is
at
the
time
that
class
certification
is
sought,
the
question
is
do
common
issues
predominate?
and
the
question
in
a
securities
case
is,
is
reliance
in
fact,
to
quote
this
court's
opinion,
“
in
fact
a
common
issue
”?
you
also
have
to
--
to
show
that
in
fact
it's
a
common
issue,
you
have
to
show
that
the
market
reacted
to
the
statement,
whether
it
was
true
or
false,
whether
it
was
made
with
scienter
or
not,
whether
there
was
loss
causation
or
not,
the
market
had
to
react,
and
to
do
that,
you
need
all
three
legs
of
the
stool.
the
statement
has
to
be
material
because
immaterial
statements
don't
move
markets.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
me
as
well,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i'm
not
being
sarcastic.
materiality
is
a
common
question.
just
as
are
many
of
the
other
elements
of
a
10b-5
action--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
question,
justice
--
i
mean,
for
--
if
it
worked
for
class
certification,
that
would
be
fine.
the
question
is,
what
the
purported
class
representative
has
to
show
to
get
through
the
certification
gate
to
transform
an
ordinary
bilateral
dispute
about
"you
made
a
false
statement,
i
relied
on
it,
it
caused
me
to
lose
money.
"
into
something
entirely
different,
a
class
of
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people,
all
of
whom
are
proceeding
together,
all
of
their
fortunes
are
married,
and
the
defendant
is
faced
with
the
full
class,
what
you
have
to
show.
and
you
have
to
show
that
reliance
is
a
common
issue.
regardless
of
what
you
have
to
show
down
the
road.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
differ
temporally,
they
differ
functionally,
and
they
differ
in
terms
of
who
decides
it
and
with
what
level
of
finality.
they
differ
temporally
because
the
first
question
is,
is
this
case
going
to
--
which
of
two
tracks
is
this
case
going
to
proceed?
is
it
going
to
proceed
as
a
--
as
a
direct
reliance
case
--
i
heard
the
statement
and
i
relied
on
it
--
or
is
it
going
to
proceed
on
a
theory
on
behalf
of
everybody
that
whether
--
the
people
who
relied
on
it,
the
people
who
heard
it
or
who
didn't
hear
it
on
a
theory
that
the
--
we
rely
on
the
integrity
of
the
market,
and
the
integrity
of
the
market
was
impaired
if
the
statement
was
false.
in
any
event,
there
was
a
price
effect.
and
there
isn't
a
price
effect
if
the
statement
wasn't
material
and
made
publicly
into
an
efficient
market.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
material
means
at
both,
as
this
court
said,
that
there
is
a
substantial
likelihood
that
the
information
would
have
been
viewed
by
a
reasonable
investor
as
having
significantly
altered
the
total
mix
of
information
available.
that
is
the
test.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct.
just
like
the
market
efficiency
and
the
public
statement
and
the
market
timing.
every
one
of
those
predicates
has
to
be
proven
to
the
jury's
satisfaction
at
trial.
all
of
them
are
exactly
the
same
in
that
respect.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.

friend's
position
is
they
concede
that
materiality
is
a
predicate
for
class
reliance.
they
agree
that
unless
the
statement
is
material,
however
efficient
the
market,
however
loudly
the
statement
was
published,
there
is
no
detrimental
reliance
on
the
integrity
of
the
market
price.
reliance
can
only
be
approved
--
and
justice
breyer,
this
goes
to
your
traditional
paradigm
case
--
in
the
paradigm
case,
reliance
was
proven
by
the
fact
that
you
heard
the
statement
and
you
did
something
in
reliance
on
it,
to
your
detriment.
the
innovation
of
basic,
and
the
notion
that
basic
didn't
say
anything
about
class
certification
under
rule
23
is
astonishing,
given
the
fact
that
the
whole
reason
that
the
question
of
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory
was
presented
was
the
inquiry
about
whether
there
could
be
--
whether
the
traditional
bilateral
method
of
proving
detrimental
reliance
on
a
statement
could
be
aggregated
into
a
ginormous
class
by
allowing
everyone
to
say
well,
we
relied
on
the
integrity
of
the
market
price
and
a
material
misstatement
--
a
material
statement
affected
that
price.
they
said
“
could
have
”--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
exactly
right.
and
what
the
court
in
basic
could
have
said,
justice
breyer,
was:
forget
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory;
we
are
going
to
absolve,
we
are
going
to
say
that
for
10b-5
actions,
you
don't
have
to
prove
reliance
directly
on
the
statement.
we
are
going
to
allow
you
to
--
we
--
we
posit
that
investors
rely
in
common
on
the
integrity
of
the
market
price;
and
if
you
can
demonstrate
to
us
that
a
challenged
statement
moved
the
market,
if
there
was
market
effect,
we
will
allow
you
to
proceed
as
a
class;
because
then
the
common
answer
to
the
common
question,
how
are
you
going
to
prove
reliance
is
we
are
going
to
prove
it
all
the
same
way,
because
investors
rely
on
the
integrity
of
the
market
price.
now,
the
court
in
basic--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
have
to
prove
that
there
--
the
court
explained
correctly
in
basic,
and
this
--
this
actually
goes
to
--
anticipates
my
next
point,
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
in
basic
didn't
say:
well,
we're
going
to
allow
you
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we're
going
to
allow
you
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
and
in
fact
it's
a
shortcut
to
a
shortcut.
what
the
court
in
basic
could
have
said
is:
if
you
want
to
proceed
as
a
class,
you
prove
to
the
court
that
reliance
is
common
by
showing
that
the
market
misstatement
affected
the
market
price.
but
the
court
in
basic
went
further
in
the
direction
of
class
plaintiffs
and
said:
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
directly.
all
you
have
to
prove
--
we
will
allow
that
to
be
presumed
if
you
can
demonstrate
without
effective
rebuttal
four
things:
the
statement
was
of
a
type
that
the
market
would
care
about;
the
statement
was
made
publicly
in
an
efficient
market;
and
the
trading
occurred
during
the
period
between
the
misstatement
and
the
correction--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--of
course
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
answer
is
that
this
is
the
--
that
the
point
of
rule
23
is
to
say,
you
get
to
use
this
very
useful
and
powerful
device
if
you
have
the
key
to
the
gate,
and
the
key
to
the
gate
is
showing
that
the
answer
to
the
question,
will
reliance
be
proven
commonly
--
not
lost
commonly,
but
proven
commonly
--
is
in
fact
yes.
thank
you.
