justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
there
--
are
you
saying
that
there
is
a
difference
between
materiality
for
the
fraud-on-the-market
theory
and
for
direct
reliance,
or
that
there
can
be
a
difference?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
if
there
was
fraud
on
the
market,
that
is
a
materiality
question
addressed
at
the
certification
stage,
but
if
the
class
isn't
certified,
the
investor
can
still
show
that
he
had
had
direct
reliance
that
was
reasonable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am
i
right
about
that?
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
the
first
part.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
--
doesn't
that
assume
that
the
efficient
market
theory
is
always
relevant
to
materiality?
and
there
might
be
instances
in
which
there
is
subjective
reliance,
which
we
inquire
into,
that
is
objectively
reasonable,
but
that
does
not
involve
a
fraud
on
the
market?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
--
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
--
you
are
saying
that
if
everyone
loses,
if
it's
not
material,
that's
a
common
issue
and
therefore,
the
trial
court
at
the
certification
stage
does
not
have
to
determine
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
how
that's
different
from
what
i
said.
but
in
other
words,
you
are
saying
that
market
efficiency
is
just
presumed
and
everybody
wins
or
everybody
loses,
and
so
you
can
have
a
class
action
even
though
the
trial
judge
is
convinced
that
there
is
no
adequate
common
market
theory
to
support
the
common
--
the
common
injury.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
have
the
--
you
have
the
burden
of
justifying
class
certification--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
not
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
now
suppose
there
is
some
real
question
of
whether
or
not
the
causal
chain
hasn't
been
broken,
the
causal
chain
between
the
misstatement
and
the
movement
in
price.
don't
you
have
to
prove
the
integrity
of
the
causal
chain?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
the
certification
stage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
it's
material
even
though
there
is
no
cause
in
fact?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
then
--
that
imparts
the
question
of
24
years
of
economic
scholarship
--
i
think
that's
how
long
it's
been
since
basic
was
decided
--
has
shown
that
the
efficient
market
theory
is
--
is
really
an
overgeneralization.
it
could
be
much
more
subtle
than
that
and
so
you
have
an
advanced
theory.
but
you
want
us
to
ignore
that.
