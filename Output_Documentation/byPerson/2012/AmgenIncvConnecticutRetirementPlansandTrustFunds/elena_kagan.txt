mr.
waxman,
that's
just
to
say
that
a
plaintiff
can
always
relitigate
the
question
of
materiality.
but
at
the
class
certification
stage,
isn't
it
correct
that
if
the
court
holds
that
a
statement
is
immaterial,
it's
immaterial
for
all
members
of
the
class,
and
the
suit
has
to
be
dismissed?
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
it
can't
proceed
as
an
anything
action,
can
it?
i
mean,
the
--
the
remedy,
if
you
had
thought
that
the
statement
was
immaterial,
is
not
to
say,
i
won't
approve
a
class.
it
would
be
to
say
the
suit
has
no
merit.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
a
judge
who
has
just
ruled
that
a
statement
is
immaterial
is
going
to
keep
the
case
in
his
court
litigated
by
an
individual
plaintiff,
even
though
he's
just
ruled
that
the
statement
is
immaterial?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you're
saying
that
a
judge
on
a
class
certification
stage
can
say:
this
is
immaterial,
the
statement
is
immaterial;
therefore,
this
can't
proceed
as
a
class
action.
but
when
a
summary
judgment
motion
comes
in
arguing
the
exact
same
thing,
the
judge
will
say:
oh,
it's
not
immaterial
after
all,
or
it's
disputed
enough
that
the
case
can
continue?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
the
question,
mr.
waxman,
is
if
it
is
not
immaterial
as
a
matter
of
law
at
the
summary
judgment
stage,
how
could
a
judge
possibly
say
it
is
material
at
the
class
certification
stage?
justice
elena
kagan
so
the
class
certification
stage
becomes
kind
of
a
super
merits
inquiry?
justice
elena
kagan
--where
the
plaintiff
has
to
--
has
to
surmount
a
higher
burden
on
the
merits?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
waxman,
that
is
right,
and
that's
what
we
said
in
walmart
recently,
that
the
question
is
a
question
of
coherence;
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
class
wins
or
loses
together.
and
here,
for
materiality,
the
class
wins
or
loses
together.
if
it's
material,
it's
material
as
to
everybody.
if
it's
not
material
it's
not
material
as
to
everybody.
and
that's
just
a
function
of
the
fact
that
materiality,
as
we've
repeatedly
said,
is
an
objective
test.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
a
particular
person
finds
it
material.
and
where
that's
the
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
walmart
test,
which
is,
is
an
issue
central
to
the
--
you
know,
when
you
rule
on
the
issue,
do
you
rule
on
each
of
the
claims
in
one
stroke?
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
waxman,
i
was
saying
that's
right.
justice
elena
kagan
there
is
class
cohesion
as
to
materiality.
people
win
or
lose
on
materiality
together.
justice
elena
kagan
what
is
that
statement,
mr.
waxman?
justice
elena
kagan
because
the
difference
is
if
there
is
an
insufficient
market,
the
case
goes
forward
and
people
have
to
prove
individual
reliance,
and
that
means
that
the
class
splits
apart
and
you
don't
get
a
coherent
class.
so
the
function
of
your
winning
an
argument
either
on
publicity
or
on
the
efficient
market
is
that
the
class
becomes
incoherent,
that
everybody
then
has
to
prove
individual
reliance.
but
that's
not
what
happens
when
you
prove
immateriality.
when
you
prove
immateriality,
the
whole
class
falls
together,
because
it's
immaterial
for
everybody.
