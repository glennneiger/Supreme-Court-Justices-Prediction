justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
suggesting
--
i
don't
know
that
the
parties
--
i
know
that
the
government
has
said
that
(f)
doesn't
apply
to
the
father,
but
(d)
does,
so
there's
not
a
full
concession
on
your
point.
but
putting
that
aside,
if
it
is
a
father
who
has
visitation
rights,
and
exercising
all
of
his
support
obligations,
is
it
your
position
that
--
that
because
that
father's
not
a
custodian,
he
has
no
protections
whatsoever
under
(d)
or
(e)?
the
state
can
come
and
take
the
child
away
from
an
unfit
mother
or
father
if
they're
the
ones
with
custody,
and
that
responsible
parent
who
only
has
visiting
rights
has
no
protections
under
(d),
(e),
or
(f)?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
asking
about
state
law--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
asking
about
federal
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
(d)
doesn't
talk
about
custodial
rights.
i
do
agree
that
(f)
talks
about
continued--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--custody.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
don't
think
that
a
parent
with
custody
--
well,
you
do
think
a
parent
with
custody
is
the
only
definition
of
family,
but
why
wouldn't
a
noncustodial
parent
with
visitation
rights
be
considered
a
family
with
that
child?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
going
to
state
law--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
there
is
a
support
obligation
on
that
unwed
father.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
that
a
parental
right?
it's
one
of
the
parental
rights
the
states
enforce
whether
or
not
you
want
to
provide
support
or
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
you
do
with
the
states
that
do
give
unwed
fathers
that
don't
support
their
children
and
who
don't
have
an
ongoing
relationship
the
right
to
be
considered
first
for
adoption?
why
should
we
follow
the
definitions
of
south
carolina
or
those
other
states?
why
shouldn't
we
just
give
it
a
federal
meaning?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what's
the
difference
with
a
sperm
donor?
i
mean,
i
know
that
you
raise
that
in
your
brief.
but,
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
if
the
choice
is
between
a
mother,
a
biological
father,
or
a
stranger,
and
if
the
father's
fit,
why
do
you
think
that
the
federal
statute
requires
that
it
be
given
to
a
stranger
rather
than
to
the
biological
father
when
the
statute
defines
“
parent
”
as
the
biological
father?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
do
with
the
lower
court's
determination
that
one
of
the
factors
of
the
best
interest
calculus
was
the
federal
policy
to
ensure
that
indian
children,
children
of
biological
indian
parents,
at
least
one,
should
be
raised
with
their
parents?
because
the
lower
court
said
it
thought
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
this
child
to
stay
with
its
birth
father
in
light
of
the
federal
policy.
so
i
disagree
with
your
colleague
that
there
wasn't
a
best
interest--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
do
i
do
with
the
lower
court's
finding
that
this
father,
despite
not
being
married
to
his
prior
lover,
had
children,
was
attentive
of
those
children,
had
the
resources
to
raise
the
child?
what
do
we
with
--
why
are
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
they
looked
at
something
else
that
everybody's
ignoring--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
clement,
can
i
go
back
to
that
best
interest
calculus.
there's
two
timeframes
in
my
mind
to
look
at:
in
january,
when
he
asserted
his
parental
rights
and
2
years
later
when
the
trial
was
heard.
if
there's
serious
emotional
harm,
i
think
the
court
below
said:
we're
not
looking
at
what
happens
at
the
time
we're
deciding
the
custody
issue,
because
otherwise,
we're
going
to
give
custody
by
estoppel.
we're
going
to
encourage
people
to
hold
on
to
kids
and
create
the
serious
physical
harm.
in
january,
when
he
asserted
his
rights,
that's
what
we're
looking
at.
what
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
at
the
time
the
issue
was
raised,
and
that
was
4
or
5
months
after
the
birth
of
the
child.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we're
going
to
freeze
it
at
that
point
or
are
we
going
to
freeze
it
today,
after
the
child's
been
with
his
--
with
her
father
for
2
years?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
want
to
be
that
judge,
by
the
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
why
you
are
fighting
justice
breyer?
he
said:
i
see
--
and
your
--
mr.
clement
said
the
same
thing
--
that
“
good
cause
”
under
1958
is
a
variant
of
best
interests
of
the
child
or
factors
that
are
considered.
i
see
(f)
as
doing
the
same
thing,
allotting
however
a
burden
of
proof
that
may
or
may
not
be
higher
than
other
states.
i
mean,
in
--
in
--
some
states
may
have
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
some
states
may
have
preponderance.
some
states
--
i
don't
know
if
any
have
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
it's
an
allocation
of
burden.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
might
just
have
to
take--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
there
are
two
forms
of
the
eifd
doctrine,
the
existing
indian
family
doctrine.
one
applies
directly
to
this
case;
what's
the
status
of
an
unwed
father,
and
they
seem,
under
that
doctrine,
to
apply
the
definition
that
a
parent
who
hasn't
been
involved
in
the
care
during
pregnancy
is
not
a
father.
but
the
other
side
of
the
doctrine
is
the
one
that
addresses,
i
think,
the
chief's
concern,
which
is
you
don't
only
have
indian
blood,
but
you've
been
a
father
who's
actually
been
a
member
of
an
indian
tribe,
an
active
member.
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
separate
issue
here,
that
eifd
--
that
part
of
the
eifd
doctrine.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
disagree.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
this
act,
in
terms
of
voluntary
surrender
of
indian
children
by
parents,
says
that
it's
not
final
for
an
adoptive
parent
until
the
court
does
the
adoption
decree.
it
gives
the
mother
the
right
--
or
father
--
to
rescind
the
voluntary
adoption
till
the
very
last
minute.
has
that
stopped
voluntary
adoptions?
