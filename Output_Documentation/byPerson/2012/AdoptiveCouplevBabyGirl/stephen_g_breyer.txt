justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
wait,
wait,
wait.
isn't
your
answer
1915(a)
still
applies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
1915(a)
means
--
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
does
have
a
--
a
considerable
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
they'll
have
to
go
through
a
set
and
decide.
they
have
to
give
it
to
him
unless
--
unless
something
overcomes
the
preference
or
there
is
good
cause
to
the
contrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you're
thinking
about
this
case.
i'm
thinking
in
general.
i
think
the
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
do
we
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
actually,
it
does
--
does
(f)
apply
in
your
opinion
to
this
case
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
(f)
has
something
of
the
best
interest
standard
tilted
towards
the
indian
parent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right
or
not?
i
mean,
as
i
read
it
it's
something.
it's
tough,
but
it's
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
your
view
the
best
interest
standard
does
not
apply,
but
rather
(f)
applies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
(f)
is
a
tough
version
of
the
best
interest
standard.
have
i
got
it
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
should
if
i'm
not
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
is
a
problem.
because,
look,
i
mean,
as
it
appears
in
this
case
is
he
had
three
cherokee
ancestors
at
the
time
of
george
washington's
father.
all
right?
now,
you
say,
oh,
well,
that's
a
different
issue.
but
i
don't
see
how
to
decide
that
case
without
thinking
about
this
issue,
because
if
your
view
is
taken
and
you
accept
that
definition,
a
woman
who
is
a
rape
victim
who
has
never
seen
the
father
could,
would,
in
fact,
be
at
risk
under
this
statute
that
the
child
would
be
taken
and
given
to
the
father
who
has
never
seen
it
and
probably
just
got
out
of
prison,
all
right?
and
you
don't
know
that
this
beyond
reasonable
doubt
standard
would
satisfy
that.
now,
that's
obviously
something
i
find
disturbing,
as
a
person
and
also
as
a
judge,
because
we're
trying
to
interpret
the
statute
to
avoid
results
that
would
be
very
far
out,
at
least.
and
--
and
that's
what
i
want
you
to
tell
me.
how
do
i
prevent
that
kind
of
risk
through
an
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
doesn't
it
happen,
in
your
interpretation,
unlike
the
two
parties
who
have
an
interpretation
i
can
understand,
that
--
remember
my
hypothetical,
which
i
deliberately
made
dramatic.
we
can
think
of
a
whole
range
of
things
short
of
that
where
the
father
has
seen
the
mother
never,
perhaps,
or
sperm
donors
for
very
short
periods
of
time,
and
under
your
interpretation
where
there
is
an
ongoing
relationship,
even
a
short
one,
at
least
they
can't
give
the
child
to
the
father
where
it
would
be
very
harmful
to
the
--
to
the
child.
but
under
your
interpretation,
the
one
category
of
people
who
is
exempt
from
that
are
the
category
of
fathers
who've
never
seen
the
mother.
who've
seen
the
mother
a
very
short
time.
who
may
be
in
--
they're
not
even
subject
to
looking
to
see
if
it's
very
harmful
to
the
child.
so
i
just
--
am
i
right
about
your
interpretation
having
that
effect?
and
if
it
does
have
that
effect,
what's
the
justification
for
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
can
say,
oh,
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
parent,
a
father
who
only
sees
the
mother--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
okay.
all
right.
now,
let's
suppose
there
is
such
a
thing.
as
long
as
there
is
such
a
thing,
the
anomaly
that
i
mention
seems
to
me
to
exist.
and
am
i
wrong
or
right
about
that?
and
if
it
exists,
what's
the
basis
for
your
creating
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
would
produce
it?
