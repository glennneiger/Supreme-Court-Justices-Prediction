but,
ms.
blatt,
if
he's
a
parent,
why
wouldn't
some
provision
in
1912
give
him
some
rights?
in
other
words,
what's
the
point
of
making
him
a
parent
under
that
definitional
section
if
he
doesn't
get
any
of
the
protections
that
1912
provides
for
when
to
terminate
rights?
justice
elena
kagan
but
what's
the
point
of
labeling
him
a
parent
if
he
gets
no
parental
rights
under
the
statute
and
if
the
termination
provisions
don't
apply
to
him?
justice
elena
kagan
but
what
are
they
supposed
to--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
how
are
they
significant?
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
understand
this,
because
if
you
get
notice,
but
then
you
have
nothing
to
say
in
the
proceeding
because
the
statute
gives
you
no
rights
and
the
statute
doesn't
provide
any
standards
for
terminating
those
rights--
justice
elena
kagan
--what
are
you
supposed
to
do
once
you
get
notice?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
you're
not
answering
the
question
of
what's
the
point
of
labeling
him
a
parent
if
he
gets
none
of
the
protections
that
the
act
provides
to
a
parent?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
blatt,
continuing
on
the
assumption
that
this
man
is
a
parent
under
the
statutory
definition,
what
your
argument
seems
to
be
suggesting
is
that
there
are
really
two
classes
of
parents
under
the
statute,
right,
that
everybody
is
labeled
a
parent,
but
then
there
are
the
parents
who
get
the
protections
of
--
of
the
termination
of
rights
provision
and
the
parents
who
don't.
and
i'm
just
wondering
why
if
this
statute
creates
two
classes
of
parents
it
didn't
say
that
in
a
more
upfront
kind
of
way.
justice
elena
kagan
it
seems
a
strange
thing
to
read
into
a
statute
in
this
sort
of
backhanded
way
that
there
are
really
two
kinds
of
parents.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
does
(f)
apply?
it
says
“
continued
custody
”.
that
seems
to
assume
that
custody
exists.
justice
elena
kagan
so
your
argument
is
not
that
“
continued
”
means
something
different
from
the
normal
language;
your
argument
is
that
“
custody
”
means
something
different
from
its
normal
language.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
kneedler,
let's
say
you're
right
that
this
man
is
a
parent
under
the
terms
of
the
act,
so
not
just
a
biological
father
but
also
he
has
a
legal
status
as
parent
under
this
act.
and
then
1912
says,
well,
this
is
how
you
go
about
terminating
parental
rights,
right?
but
then
your
argument
suggests
that
one
of
these
clauses
applies
to
him
and
the
other
one
doesn't,
even
though
he's
a
parent.
but
you're
saying
he
only
gets
some
of
the
protections,
that
there
are
really
two
classes
of
parents,
custodial
parents
and
non.
so
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
elena
kagan
but
as
a
federal
overlay,
mr.
kneedler,
i
mean,
does
it
make
sense
to
sort
of
split
apart
(d)
and
(f)
in
this
way?
because
(d)
is
the
curing
provision
that
says
you
have
to
take
steps
to
try
to
cure
this
parent
and,
you
know,
to
try
to
make
him
or
her
a
better
parent.
and
then
(f)
says
here's
the
standard
for
terminating
parental
rights
if
those
curative
efforts
have
failed.
right?
so
to
--
to
use
--
to
have
the
curative
provision
but
not
the
standard
just
seems
to
--
to
make
a
--
a
mess
of
the
statute.
