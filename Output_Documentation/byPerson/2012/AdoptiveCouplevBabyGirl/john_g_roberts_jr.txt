chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-399,
adoptive
couple
v.
baby
girl.
ms.
blatt?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
--
could
i
hear
her
answer,
please?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
your
position
that
the
preference
is
absolute
or
is
it
simply
a
factor
to
be
considered
with
the
other
--
in
other
words,
if
every
other
factor
suggests
that
the
best
interests
of
the
child
are
served
by
placement
with
the
adoptive
couple,
does
the
preference
under
1915(a)
trump
all
those
other
interests?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
the
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rothfeld?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
think
that's
correct
under
the
act?
where
in
the
act
does
it
say
that
you
need
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
father
is
a
--
would
be
a
good
parent?
i
thought
your
reading
was
that
it
doesn't
matter,
all
that
matters
is
that
he
has
in
his
case
3/128ths
cherokee
blood.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
--
could
i
go
back
to
what
you
just
said
about
(f)?
you
think
custody
covers
someone
who
has
never
had
custody
of
the
child
because
it
refers
to
something
beyond
the
accepted
definition?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
(f)
doesn't
say
“
child
custody
proceeding
”.
it
says
“
continued
custody
of
the
child
”.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not
me,
right?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
not
--
(f)
is
not
about
terminating
parental
rights.
it's
about
what
--
i
mean,
it's
about
custody,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
what
proceeding,
the
adoption
proceeding
or
custody
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
--
if
you
had
a
tribe,
is
there
at
all
a
threshold
before
you
can
call,
under
the
statute,
a
child
an
“
indian
child
”?
3/256ths?
and
what
if
the
tribe
--
what
if
you
had
a
tribe
with
a
zero
percent
blood
requirement;
they're
open
for,
you
know,
people
who
want
to
apply,
who
think
culturally
they're
a
cherokee
or
--
or
any
number
of
fundamentally
accepted
conversions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
is
it
--
is
--
would
that
child
be
considered
an
indian
child,
so
a
father
who
had
renounced
any
interest
in
her
until
he
found
out
about
the
adoption
would
have
all
these
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
that's
why
i
asked
it.
it's
a
different
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
return
to
what
is
a
hypothetical
question
and
not
what
the
statute
provides:
under
your
argument,
a
tribe
that
did
not
require
any
blood
requirement,
but
simply
enrollment,
could
be
considered
an
indian
child.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
you
have
somebody
who
has
no
indian
blood,
he
enrolls
in
my
hypothetical
tribe,
has
a
biological
child.
that
child
would
be
an
indian
child
and
the
father
would
be
entitled
to
the
protections
you're
arguing
for.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
just
wondering
is
3/256ths
close
--
close
to
zero?
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
the
question
in
terms
to
me,
that
if
you
have
a
definition,
is
it
one
drop
of
blood
that
triggers
all
these
extraordinary
rights?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
was
excited,
but
there
is
no
doubt
he
paid
nothing
during
the
pregnancy
and
nothing
at
the
time
of
the
birth,
right,
to
support
the
child
or
the
mother?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
he
was
excited
by
it;
he
just
didn't
want
to
take
any
responsibility.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
an
extra
--
you
have
an
extra
minute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
he
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
the
child
if
the
mother
had
kept
the
child
in
her
care.
it
was
only
when
she
wanted
to
put
it
up
for
adoption
that
he
had
developed
this
interest
in
the
child.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what's
--
is
--
is
--
are
the
would-be
adoptive
parents
required
to
provide
remedial
services
and
rehabilitative
programs
under
(d)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
it's
a
tribe
--
if
the
tribe
wants
to
defeat
the
adoption,
all
they
have
to
do
is
do
nothing
with
respect
to
the
father's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
ms.
blatt,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
