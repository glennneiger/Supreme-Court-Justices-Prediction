mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
simply
false
to
say
that
this
child's
custody
was
transferred
without
a
best
interest
determination,
as
is
apparent
from
any
reading
of
the
lower
court
decisions
in
this
case.
both
of
the
state
courts
here
looked
very
closely
at
the
situation
here
and
they
found,
in
their
words,
that
the
father
here
was
a
"fit,
devoted,
and
loving
father.
"
and
they
said
expressly
and
found
expressly
as
a
factual
matter
that
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
this
child.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
--
i
think
that
there
is
some
confusion
as
to
exactly
what
the
state
courts
did
here
and
what
icwa
does.
icwa
does
not
assign
custody.
icwa
--
icwa
addresses
the
question
whether
or
not
the
parental
rights
of
--
of
a
parent
of
an
indian
child
can
be
terminated.
the
courts
here,
both
courts,
correctly
held
that
under
the
plain
application
of
icwa,
under
section
1912(d),
as
discussed
by
justices
sotomayor
and
scalia,
clearly
parental
rights
could
not
be
terminated.
the
question
then
arose:
what
happens
to
the
child?
and
the
court
then,
because
there
were
a
natural
parent
with
intact
parental
rights,
applied
the
usual
rule
that
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
a
fit
parent,
natural
parent,
who
wants
to
exercise
custody
of
--
of
his
or
her
child
should
get
custody.
that
was
what
happened
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
the
analysis
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
was
exactly
right
in
this
--
in
--
in
those
terms.
the
court
applied
icwa,
the
federal
statute.
the
question
was:
could
the
parental
rights
of
this
parent
be
terminated?
this
--
everyone
concedes
this
is
an
indian
child.
icwa
applies
because
of
that.
the
question
then
is:
can
the
parental
rights
be
terminated?
sections
1912(e)
and
(f)
address
that
question
--
(d),
(e),
and
(f).
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
not
in
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
that
--
that,
too,
is
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
that
is
precisely
what
the
ordinary
state
law
standard
says,
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
natural
parent,
if
the
natural
parent
is
fit,
should
be
awarded
custody
of
the
child.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
it
--
in
our
opinion,
both
(d)
and
(f)
apply.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
that's
right,
but
i
--
but
i
would
add
the
--
the
caveat
that
it's
not
a
best
interest
in
the
sense
of
we
are
going
to
apply
this
standard
to
determine
custody.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
(f)
applies--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--correct,
but
with
this
addition:
what
it
applies
for
is
the
question
whether
or
not
the
rights
of
this
parent
can
be
terminated,
whether
the
parental
rights
of
the
parent
can
be
terminated.
and
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
--
that
is
the
other
side's
argument.
our
response
is
that
there
is
a
definitional
provision
in
icwa
that
says
that
a
child
custody
proceeding
is
one
that
includes
a
proceeding
leading
to
the
termination
of
parental
rights.
parental
rights
are
defined
to
be
broadly
as
the
parent-child
relationship.
and
so
we
think
in
context
(f)
means
that
it's
the
termination
of
the
parent-child
relationship
is
what
has
to
be
considered.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
our
argument
is
that
“
custody
”
means
what
congress
said
“
child
custody
proceeding
”
means,
which
is
termination
of
the
parent-child
relationship.
and
so
we
think
that
continuation
of
a
relationship
--
the
question
is
under
(f)
would
that
be
harmful
for
the
child?
but
i
should
quickly
say
that
(f)
is
only
one
part
of
the
argument
here.
as
justices
sotomayor
and
scalia
began
the
discussion
with
ms.
blatt,
(d)
also
applies.
(d)
says
nothing
at
all
about
custody.
the
question
under--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
--
again,
the
definition
of
“
child
custody
proceeding
”
in
icwa
includes
a
proceeding
leading
to
the
termination
of
parental
rights.
parental
rights--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that's
true,
but
i
think
that
has
to
be
interpreted
within
the
context
of
the
definitional
provision
and
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
referred
to
child
custody
proceeding.
but
i
think
--
you
know,
(f),
as
i
say,
is
only
a
portion
of
the
argument
here.
and
to
return
to
what
justices--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no.
i
--
i
think
that
that's
right,
and
i
certainly
don't
intend
to
fight
justice
breyer.
i
--
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
don't--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--absolutely
not.
and
i
--
and
i
think
i
--
i
will
try
to
agree
with
both
justice
breyer
and
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
scalia
and
say
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
justice
sotomayor.
and
always
--
always
the
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
which
gets
me
to
five,
so.
but
i
think
--
i
think
the
crucial
point
is
what
--
what
we're
talking
about
the
determination
of
parental
rights
under
--
under
(f)
is
whether
or
not,
as
justice
scalia
says,
the
rights
of
a
biological
parent
can
be
terminated,
which
is
not
sort
of
the
ordinary
best
interest
determination
when
you're
choosing
between
two
people
who
are
strangers
to
the
child.
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
no.
i
think
(f)
is
about
--
both
(d)
and
(f)
are
about
terminating
parental
rights.
parental
rights
cannot
be
terminated
unless
these
determinations
have
been
made.
unless
it's
been
shown
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--any
proceeding
which
is
aimed
at
the
termination
of
parental
rights.
the
adoption
proceeding
here
cannot
go
forward,
all
concede,
unless
parental
rights
are
terminated.
and
so
if
parental
rights
cannot
be
terminated
under
either
(d)
or
(f),
this
adoption
cannot
go
forward
and
we
are
in
a
different
place.
i
think
that's
what
--
exactly
what
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
said.
it
said,
we're
going
to
apply
--
we're
going
to
look
to
icwa
to
see
can
we
terminate
the
parental
rights
of
this
natural
father.
and
as
justice
scalia
says,
that
is
central.
there
is
a
natural
parent
here
who
wants
custody.
can
his
--
can
his
claim
for
custody
be
denied
and
can
his
parental
rights
be
terminated?
to
determine
that,
congress
has
put
federal
standards
in
place
in
icwa,
in
(d)
and
(f),
and
we
have
to
say
both
of
those
have
been
satisfied
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
--
that
would
be
a
different
question.
what
we
have
here
is
a--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well
--
and
the
answer
would,
i
think,
be
as
a
threshold
matter,
as
this
court
has
said
consistently,
it
is
fundamental
--
fundamental
basis
of
tribal
sovereignty
that
--
that
a
tribe
get
to
determine
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
--
the
child
would
have
to
be
a
--
would
have
to
be
biological
parents--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that's
--
that's
true
in
theory.
but
of
course,
a,
that
is
not
our
case.
b,
if
that
were
to
occur
and
whether
or
not
that
would
be
sort
of
a
legitimate
basis
for
determining
membership
of
a
--
in
an
indian
tribe
i
think
would
be--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me
answer
both
that
question
and
the
chief
justice's
question
which
i
think
have
similar
responses.
as
to
the
rape
victim,
i
am
confident
that
an
application
of
section
1912(f)
would
lead
to
termination
of
that
father's
parental
rights,
and
so
he
would
never
be
in
the
picture
as
a
possible
--
well,
the
question
whether
or
not
custody
of
someone
who
has
engaged
in
such
conduct
could
lead
to
serious
physical
or
emotional
damage
to
the
child,
i
think
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
but
on
the
question
of
could
a
tribe
establish
some
manipulative
type
of
--
of
membership
criteria,
it's
significant
that
that
is
not
this
case
because--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
is
quite
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
as
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
to
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
it
has
always
been
the
cherokee
membership
criterion
that
if
someone
who
can
trace
their
lineal
ancestry
to
some
--
to
a
person
who
is
on
the
dawes
rolls
is
a
member.
no
one
has
ever
questioned
that
that
is
a
legitimate
basis
for
establishing
tribal
citizenship.
and
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that
that
would
lead
to
the
question
posed
by
justice
scalia.
whether
or
not
that
would
be
a
legitimate
basis
for
establishing--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
i
--
i
think
it
leads
to
his
question
that
there
is
a
federal
element
to
recognition
of
an
indian
tribe.
and
i
think
whether
or
not
tribal
membership
criteria
so
far
depart
from
the
traditional
understanding
of
what
constitutes
a
tribe
as
to
be
acceptable
for
those
purposes,
that
would
be
a
question
to
be
resolved
by
the
united
states,
by
the
political
branches.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
guess
i'll
give
you
two
answers
to
that.
first,
in
this
case,
there
has
been
a
finding
by
the
family
court
that
this
father
has
significant
ties
to
the
cherokee
nation.
and
so,
if
one
could
think
that
that
was
part
of
the
test
under
icwa,
it
is
certainly
satisfied
here.
i
--
i
would
go
further
than
that
and
say
that
i
think
the
vast
majority
of
state
courts
have
correctly
rejected
that
theory,
because--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
--
it
would
be
sort
of
beyond
the
judicial
competence
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
person
is
indian
enough
to
qualify
for
treatment
as
a
father
of
an
indian
child
under
--
under
icwa.
just
to
nail
this
down,
as
to
the
particular
membership
criteria
of
the
cherokee
nation,
no
one
has
ever
suggested,
our
opponents
here
do
not
suggest
that
that
is,
in
any
sense,
illegitimate
or
not
a
traditional
basis
for
establishing
membership
in
an
indian
tribe.
so
if
one
can
imagine
wild
hypotheticals
of
the
sort
that
justice
alito
and
the
chief
justice
have
suggested,
they
are
not
present
here,
and
those
would
present
political
questions
to
be
addressed
by
congress
or
addressed
by
the
executive
branch.
in
this
case,
again,
the
sate
courts
found
that
icwa
should
be
applied
to
allow
a
natural
father
to
raise
his
child.
those
courts
found
that
s
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
be
raised
by
their
natural
parent
because
that
parent
was
a
fit,
was
a
loving,
was
a
devoted
parent
in
the
words
of
--
of
the
lower
courts.
those
conclusions
were
quite
clearly
correct.
and
if
i
can
turn
to
something
which
attracted
some
attention
from
justice
scalia
and
justice
sotomayor
in
their
exchanges
with
ms.
blatt,
the
application
of
section
1912(d)
and
whether
or
not
the
parental
rights
of
this
--
this
father,
who
unquestionably
satisfies
the
definition
of
parent
in
icwa,
section
1912(d)
says
that
parental
rights
cannot
be
terminated
unless
remedial
efforts
have
been
made,
rehabilitative
efforts
have
been
made
to
fix
a
family
that
is
broken
in
some
respect.
and
ms.
blatt
suggests
that
that
does
not
apply
here
because
there
was
no
indian
family.
i
think
what
justice
scalia
said
was
absolutely
right.
there
unquestionably
was
a
family
here
in
the
ordinary
sense.
there
was
a
mother,
there
was
a
father,
there
was
their
little
girl,
there
were
grandparents
who
very
much
wanted
to
be
involved
in
the
life
of
this
child,
who
knit
socks
for
her.
there's
no
question--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
is
quite
correct.
i
think
that
the
genesis
of
this
case,
they
--
they
were
an
engaged
couple
and
the
mother
broke
the
engagement.
the
father
wanted,
very
much
wanted
to
marry
the
mother,
wanted
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
--
there
are
disputed
facts
as
to
what
was
going
on,
and
so
i
don't
want
to
hinge
a
lot
on
this.
but
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
the
father
--
they
were
engaged,
the
father
wanted
to
marry
the
mother.
the
father's
testimony
--
and
the
family
court
found,
so
we're
not
talking
about
simply,
you
know,
assertions
here.
the
family
court
found
that
the
father
was
excited
by
the
pregnancy,
was
looking
forward
to
the
birth
of
the
child,
that
he
wanted
to
marry
the
mother
so
that
she
would
qualify
for
military
health
benefits.
the
father
at
the
time--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
is
true.
but
i
--
i
am--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes.
i
mean--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
--
that--
justice
kennedy.
but
what
we
have
--
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
a
federal
statute
which,
as
i
must
understand
it,
displaces
the
ordinary
best
interest
determinations
of
the
state
courts.
would
you
agree
with
that?
i
--
i
would
agree
that
congress
indicated
that
part
of
the
best
interest
inquiry
for
an
indian
child
concerns
--
takes
account
of
their
status
as
an
indian
child,
and
congress
made
a
factual
determination
--
the
fact
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
quite--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes,
that
is.
i
--
with
respect
to
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
there
are
three
things
that
are
going
on
here.
had
icwa
not
applied
here
at
all,
then
the
father
would
have
had
no
right
to
object
to
the
adoption,
so
the
adoption
would
have
gone
forward
had
it
not
been
for
icwa.
however,
as
justice
scalia
says
correctly,
when
a
natural
parent
is
involved,
and
the
natural
parent
has
rights
that
have
not
yet
been
terminated,
as
this
parent's
have
not,
then
ordinarily
a
best
interest
inquiry--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
--
i
have
to
disagree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg.
the
family
court
judge
found
that
his
parental
rights
could
not
be
terminated
as
a
matter
of
south
carolina
law,
as
well
as
a
matter
of
icwa
law.
and
so
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
this
father's
right
would
not
be
terminated.
as
justice
scalia
says,
in
the
ordinary
course,
while
we're
not
engaged
in
a
free-floating
best
interest
inquiry,
one
would
say
whether
or
not
a
--
a
profound
showing
of
parental
neglect
or
insufficiency
has
been
made
to
terminate
those
rights.
if
it
cannot,
then
that
father
should
get
custody.
in
response
to
what
justice
kennedy
asked
about--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
--
that
is
absolutely
right,
and
no
such
showing
has
been
made
or
could
be
made
in
this
case.
and
if
i
may
just
finish--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
--
both
of
the
state
courts
in
this
case
carefully
looked
at
the
--
at
the
situation
here
and
found
that
this
father,
far
from
being
an
unfit
father,
was
a
fit,
loving,
devoted
father
who
had
created
a
safe,
satisfactory
and
--
and
loving
environment
for
the
child.
under
ordinary
south
carolina
standards,
once
one
gets
past
icwa,
parental
rights
cannot
be
terminated
in
a
situation
of
this
sort,
the
parental
rights,
as
justice
scalia
says,
of
a
natural
parent,
who
had--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
--
the
only
reason
that
icwa
comes
into
play
is
because
south
carolina
law
did
not
give
this
father
a
right
to
object
to
the
adoption.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
not
--
with
--
with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
agree.
remedial
services
here
would
entail
--
the
remedial
services
have
to
be
tied
to
whatever
the
problem
is.
and
here
the
problem
was
the
father
had
not
shown
sufficient
interest
in
the
child.
remedial
services
would
have
been
efforts
to
interest
the
father
in
the
child.
here
that
wasn't
necessary
because
as
soon
as
the
father
found
out
about
the
adoption
proceeding,
he
acknowledged
and
established
his
paternity
and
said,
i
want
that
child.
