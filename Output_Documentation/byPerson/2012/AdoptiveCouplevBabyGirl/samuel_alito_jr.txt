but
what
if
a
tribe
makes
eligibility
available
for
anybody
who,
as
a
result
of
a
dna
test,
can
establish
any
indian
ancestry,
no
matter
how
slight?

no,
it's
different
from
his.
he
says
it's
--
it
has
to
be
based
on
blood.
this
would
be
based
on
blood.

well,
if
this
case
would
have
come
out
the
same
way
under
purely
south
carolina
law,
then
why
are
we
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
family
law
is
traditionally
a
state
province,
but
your
argument
is
that
federal
law
can
take
a
traditional
family
law
term
like
“
parent
”
and
perhaps
others
and
give
it
a
meaning
that
is
very
different
from
its
traditional
meaning
or
its
meaning
under
state
law?
justice
samuel

strike
the
"traditional
meaning:
but
its
meaning
under
state

the
second
case
is
adoptive
couple
versus
baby
girl,
no.
12-399.
this
case
involves
the
custody
of
a
young
girl
who
through
her
biological
father
has
some
native-american
ancestry.
specifically,
we
are
told
she
is
3/256
cherokee
and
as
a
result
falls
within
the
federal
indian
child
welfare
act
of
1978.
before
the
child
was
born,
her
biological
father
refused
to
provide
any
support
for
her
mother
even
though
he
was
able
to
do
so
and
he
sent
the
mother
a
text
message
giving
up
his
parental
rights.
the
mother
arranged
for
the
baby
to
be
adopted
and
the
biological
father
initially
signed
papers
stating
that
he
did
not
object
to
the
adoption.
however,
he
later
changed
his
position
and
sought
custody.
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
that
certain
provisions
of
the
indian
child
welfare
act
required
the
child
at
the
age
of
27
months
to
be
taken
from
the
only
parents
she
had
ever
known
and
handed
over
to
the
biological
father.
we
hold
that
the
federal
act
does
not
support
this
result.
a
provision
of
the
indian
child
welfare
act
25
u.s.c.
section
1912(f)
bars
involuntary
termination
of
a
parent’s
rights
in
the
absence
of
a
heightened
showing
that
serious
harm
to
the
indian
child
is
likely
to
result
from
the
parents
“continued
custody
of
the
child,
the
key
phrase
there
is
continued
custody.”
we
hold
that
this
provision
does
not
apply
when,
as
in
this
case,
the
relevant
parent
never
had
custody
of
the
child,
continued
custody
cannot
be
terminated
if
there
never
was
any
custody
in
the
first
place.
another
provision
of
the
same
statute,
section1912
(d),
conditions
involuntary
termination
of
parental
rights
with
respect
to
an
indian
child
on
a
showing
that
remedial
efforts
have
been
made
to
prevent
the
“breakup
of
the
indian
family.”
we
hold
that
this
provision
is
inapplicable
when,
as
in
this
case,
the
parent
abandoned
the
indian
child
before
birth
and
never
had
custody
of
the
child.
in
that
situation
no
indian
family
is
broken
up.
finally,
we
clarify
that
section
1915(a)
which
provides
placement
preferences
for
the
adoption
of
indian
children
does
not
bar
a
non
indian
family
like
adoptive
couple
from
adopting
an
indian
child
when
no
other
eligible
candidates
have
sought
to
adopt
the
child.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
thomas
and
justice
breyer
have
filed
concurring
opinions.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
sotomayor
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
kagan
have
joined
and
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined
and
