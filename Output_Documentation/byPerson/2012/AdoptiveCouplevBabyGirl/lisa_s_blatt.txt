ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
all
parties
agree
that
even
if
the
birth
father
is
a
parent
under
the
indian
child
welfare
act,
the
state
court
decision
below
awarding
custody
to
the
father
must
nonetheless
be
reversed
unless
sections
1912(d)
or
(f)
create
custodial
rights
that
the
father
concededly
does
not
have
under
state
law.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
under
state
law--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
i
think
that--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes,
it's
federal
law,
which
requires
custodial
rights,
would
protect
a
father
who
has
visitation,
i.e.,
custodial
rights
under
state
law.
so
in
other
words,
that
--
that
is
to
say,
if
a
father--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay.
so
let's
talk
about
(d),
because
i
think
we
are
in
agreement
that
the
respondents
would
have
to
agree
that
they
either
need
to
win
under
(d)
or
(f),
and
we
can
talk
about
section
1915,
but
that's
not
a
basis
for
father.
but
section
(d)
--
and
i'm
reading
from
the
blue
brief
at
8a
--
says
that
it
requires
the
party
seeking
the
termination
of
parental
rights
to
provide,
quote,
"remedial
services
and
rehabilitative
programs
designed
to
prevent
the
breakup
of
the
indian
family.
"
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
my
understanding
under
state
law,
a
parent
who--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes.
so
the
answer
is,
a
parent
with
visitation
rights
has
custody,
so
he's
protected.
under
state
law,
if
you're
paying
child
support
and
you
bring
a
paternity
action
and
sue
for
visitation
rights,
that's
a
petition
for
custody.
so
all
a
birth
dad
needs
to
do
to
protect
himself
is
to
acquire
legal
rights.
this
father
had
no
legal
rights
whatsoever,
parental
or
custodial,
and
the
word
“
breakup
”,
even
the
other
side
concedes,
it's
discontinuance
of
an
existing
legal
relationship.
there
was
no
legal
relationship
between
this
child
and
the
birth
father
or
his
relatives.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
if
a
child
is
being
adopted,
by
definition,
the
--
the
adoptive
family
would
be
providing
support.
but
let's
take
the
--
let's
take
what
a
--
again,
the
definition
of
breakup.
there
is
no
familial
legal
custodial
parental
relationship
that
either
this
father
or
the
--
or
his
parents
--
his
extended
family
had
with
this
child.
this
adoption
no
more
broke
up
an
indian
family
than
his
--
than
this
hispanic
sole
custodial
birth
mother
had
raised
the
child
herself.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
because
there's--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--because
there's
nothing
in
this
act
that
anyone
can
point
to
that
was
a
basis
for
transferring
custody
to
this
father.
at
most,
there
is
an
obligation,
an
exhaustion
obligation,
that
if
a
custodial
parent
has
something
like
a
drug
abuse
problem
the
state
has
to
remediate
before
the
family
is
broken
up.
what
is
so
extraordinary
about
this
case,
particularly
the
united
states'
position,
is
that
the
adoptive
parents'
failure
to
remediate
a
dad
meant
that
the
child
got
custody
of
the
dad.
so
if
this
dad
had
had
a
drug
problem,
because
there
was
no
treatment
of
him
the
court
held,
well,
that's
a
basis
for
giving
the
dad
custody.
but
there's
no
language
in
the
statute
that
even
remotely
suggests
that
it's
a
rights-creating
provision.
all
of
both
of
(d),
(e),
and
(f)
are
protections
that
assume
existing
rights
and
then
make
it
harder
to
terminate
those
rights.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
so
he--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--okay.
but
when
you--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--the
only
relationship
the
dad
had
is
one
of
biology.
and,
justice
scalia,
you
cannot
logically
break
up
that
biological
relationship,
nor
can
you
provide
remedial
services
to
prevent
the
breakup
of
that
biological
relationship.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
i'm
hanging
--
i'm
hanging
a
lot
on
two
things.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
he
has
a
biological
link
that
under
state
law
was
equivalent
to
a
sperm
donor.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
and
so
is
a
sperm
donor
under
your
definition.
he's
a
biological
father
and
nothing
else
in
the
eyes
of
state
law.
and
under
that
view--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
and
there
is
no
indian
family
here.
the
only
breakup--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--and
assuming
all
biological
fathers
that
are
acknowledged
or
established
are
swept
in,
which
would
include
any
biological
father,
the
only
stranger
in
this
case
was
the
birth
father,
who
expressly
repudiated
all
parental
rights
and
had
no
custodial
rights.
so,
again,
the
problem
the
other
side
has--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--it
was
too
late.
there's
not
a
single
state
law
that
lets
a
dad,
birth
dad,
hold
that
kind
of
veto
power
over
a
woman.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
section
1903(9).
but
even
assuming
--
which
is--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--on
page
4a.
whether
it's
a
federal
definition
or
a
state
law
definition,
i
think
everyone
agrees
you've
got
to
at
least
look
at
some
sort
of
state
law.
but
even
if
it's
just
a
bare
fact
of
paternity,
meaning
a
biological
link
is
established,
they
still
have
to
have
a
basis
for
an
extraordinary
award
of
a
transfer
of
custody
when
there's
been
no
best
interest
determination
and
you
have
a
dad
who's
a
complete
stranger
with
no
--
no
parental
rights
whatsoever.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that's
right.
and
again,
assuming
he
is
a
parent
--
they
--
they
need
to
win
both
points,
justice
ginsburg.
he
needs
to
be
a
parent.
now,
if
you're
an
icwa
parent,
which
means
if
you
want
to
accept
this
definition
of
“
all
biological
”,
you
do
have
rights
under
the
federal
act
of
getting
notice
and
a
right
to
counsel,
and
the
tribe
would
have
a
right
to
intervene.
the
question
is,
is
there
a
basis
for
transferring
custody
under
(d)
or
(f).
(f)
is
the
one
that
requires
continuing
custody.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
because
this
--
this
act
is
not
about
creating
rights
that
didn't
otherwise
exist.
it's
about
protecting
rights
and
making
it
harder
to
terminate
rights
that
already
exist.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
notice,
right
to
counsel,
and
heightened
consent
requirements.
so
the
mother
here,
the
birth
mother
is
a
parent,
so
she
had
a
right
to
notice,
right
to
counsel,
and
heightened
consent
requirements.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
so
those
are
very
significant.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
justice
kagan,
just
because
he's
in
the
door
as
a
parent,
that
doesn't
mean
the
statute
let
him
leave
out
the
back
door
with
the
child
when
there
was
no,
no
determination
with
respect
to
--
i
mean,
any
kind
--
it
would
be
unprecedented
to
think
that
because
you
had
a
failure
to
remediate
to
prevent
the
breakup
of
an
indian
family,
that's
a
basis
for
awarding
custody?
and
that's
the
united
states'
view,
which
is--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--you're
assuming
that
this
entire
act
was
to
make
sure
unwed
dads
who
are
indian
got
more
time
than
non-indian
dads
to
veto
adoptions,
and
that
had
--
that's
not
even
remotely
the
purpose
of
this.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
1915(a)
still
applies.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
19--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--he's
not
--
he
didn't
seek
to
adopt
the
child
and
he's
not
one
of
the
preferred
parties.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
no
--
no
father
is
a
preferred
party
under
1915.
no
father
can
--
can
assert
1915.
that
is--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
well,
we
have
three
responses.
first,
that
provision
assumes
that
somebody
actually
in
that
--
in
that
statute
stepped
up
to
adopt
the
child,
and
no
one
did
here.
second,
it
would
raise
grave
constitutional
concerns.
i
mean,
just
look
at
(a)(3)
on
the
other
indian
families
if
congress
presumptively
presumed
that
a
non-indian
parent
was
unfit
to
raise
any
child
with
any
amount
of
indian
blood.
and
so
it
would
either
have
to
--
it's
not
implicated
here
or
resolved
by
good
cause.
otherwise,
you
do
have
an
extraordinary
reading,
justice
ginsburg,
of
a
statute
that
would
override
a
birth
mother's
right
to
choose
the
adoptive
parents
for
her
child.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it's
not
our
view.
our
view
is
you
would
have
--
you
absolutely
would
have
had
good
cause
with
--
here
when
you
had
the
27
months
and
also
the
mother's
choice.
the
tribe
's
position
is
that--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--the
best
interests
of
the
child
is
not
listed
under
the
government's
guidelines,
which
again
is
extraordinary.
it's
also
extraordinary
that
any
other
adopt
--
any
other
indian
would
get
a
preference
whether
or
not
that
indian
had
the
same
tribal
member.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yeah.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
so
state
law
is
you
have
to
support
the
mother
during
pregnancy
or
at
birth.
so
the
cases
are
pretty
clear
that
the
father
can't
wait
till
he
learns
of
the
adoption.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no.
state
law
determines
just
when
you
have
parental
rights
to
begin
with.
so
if
there's
no
question
that
this
particular
dad,
had
state
law
applied,
the
adoption
would
have
gone
forward
and
his
rights
would
have
been
terminated
by
virtue
of
his
lack
of
a
right
to
--
to
object
to
the
adoption.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
but
you
still
have--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--custodial
rights,
though.
that's
not
a
basis
for
granting
him
custodial
rights.
this
--
again,
the
--
we
can
talk
about
(f),
but
i
think
(f)
is
pretty
obvious
that
that
assumes
preexisting
custody
to
be
continued.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
and
i
do--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--no.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
the
government
agrees
with
us
on
(f).
but
if
you
read
(d),
by
the
way,
it
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
(e)
and
(f).
it's
talking
about
the
breakup
of
a
removal
proceeding
under
(f)
or
a
foster
care
proceeding
under
(e),
and
the
government
concedes
that
neither
of
those
provisions
create
rights;
they
just
make
it
harder
to
terminate
the
custodial
rights
of
a
parent
who
has
custody
that
can
be
continued.
the
other
side
doesn't
really
have
a
definition
of
“
custody
”
or
“
continue
”
that
would
sweep
in
a
dad
without
any
parental
rights.
and
i
do
just
want
to
say
in
terms
of
looking,
taking
one
step
back.
this
is
not
the
case
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
act
to
halt
the
depletion
of
the
tribal
population.
this
involves
accretion
and
conscripting
other
people's
children
to
grow
the
tribal
population
based
solely
on
a
biological
link.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
i
think
it's
rather
completely
upside
down
that
this
entire
statute,
with
20
or
24
references
to
removal,
custody,
return
of
child
to
the
parent,
is
somehow
being
read
to
create
rights.
there
is
no
language
in
this
statute
that
creates
custodial
rights,
and
the
birth
father
in
this
case,
because
of
an
exhaustion
failure
under
(d),
walked
off
with
the
child
without
any
best
interest
determination.
if
i
could--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
you
affirm
below,
you're
basically
banning
the
interracial
adoption
of
abandoned
indian
children.
there's
not
a
single
adoptive
parent
in
their
right
mind
who
is
going
to
do
what
the
court
below
said,
which
is
go
through
these
kafkaesque
hoops
of
making
sure
an
absentee
father's
desire
to
be
a
parent
has
been
stimulated.
this
is
private
adoption.
this
is
absurd
that
an
adoptive
parent
would
beg
the
family
court
to
go
provide
parenting
classes.
and
i
wanted
to--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--no,
but
this
--
first
of
all
--
i
mean,
i
love
that
about
this
case,
the
irony
here.
he
had
no
--
we
didn't
need
his
consent
under
state
law,
so
the
application
of
1913,
which
allowed
this
withdrawal
of
consent,
mandates
the
return
of
the
child.
well,
there
was
no
way
to
return
this
child
to
anybody
other
than
the
mother.
and
i
want
you
to
keep
in
mind
about
this
case,
is
your
decision
is
going
to
apply
to
the
next
case
and
to
a
apartment
in
new
york
city
where
a
tribal
member
impregnates
someone
who's
african-american
or
jewish
or
asian
indian,
and
in
that
view,
even
though
the
father
is
a
completely
absentee
father,
you
are
rendering
these
women
second-class
citizens
with
inferior
rights
to
direct
their
reproductive
rights
and
their
--
who
raises
their
child.
you
are
relegating
adopted
parents
to
go
to
the
back
of
the
bus
and
wait
in
line
if
they
can
adopt.
and
you're
basically
relegating
the
child,
the
child
to
a
piece
of
property
with
a
sign
that
says,
"indian,
keep
off.
"
"do
not
disturb.
"
this
case
is
going
to
affect
any
interracial
adoption
of
children.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no,
no,
justice
scalia.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no,
i
think
the
policy
is
fantastic.
it
was
talking
about
indian
families
who
were
being
ripped
away
because
of
cultural
biases
and
insensitivity.
this
case
didn't
involve
cultural
biases.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
there's
30,000
pages
of
legislative
history
that's
talking
about
the
removal.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
i
agree.
1915
is
extraordinary,
if
you
read
it
the
way
the
tribe
does,
which
is
--
and
the
government
does.
and
a
little
bit
about
the
membership
criteria.
the
tribe's
view
is
any
child
born
indian
is
automatically
a
member.
so
even
if
the
parents
withdrew
their
tribal
membership,
this
child
would
be
covered.
