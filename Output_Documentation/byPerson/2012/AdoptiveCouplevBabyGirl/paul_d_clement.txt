mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
but
for
the
application
of
icwa,
two
things
would
be
crystal
clear:
the
birth
father
would
have
absolutely
no
parental
or
custodial
rights
under
state
law
or
the
constitution;
and
second,
the
baby
girl
would
be
entitled
to
a
custodial
determination
that
focused
on
her
best
interests.
now,
the
lower
courts--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
sotomayor,
would
that
it
were
true
that
the
federal
preference
was
one
factor
in
a
multifactor
test
that
looked
at
this
child
in
her
best
interest.
that
did
not
happen
here.
and
if
you
have
any
doubt
about
that,
look
at
page
40a
of
the
petition
appendix.
and
what
the
lower
court--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
you
do
with
that,
justice
sotomayor,
is
you
look
what
context
those
findings
were
made.
those
findings
were
made
in
the
context
of
1912(f),
and
the
court
specifically
said
that
for
those
purposes
all
i
can
look
at
is
the
birth
father
and
whether
this
new
custodial
relationship
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
would
pose
a
serious
harm
to
the
girl.
and
what
he--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what
the
court
specifically
said
is
they
looked
at
the
expert
testimony
of
how
it
would
cause
trauma,
despair,
anxiety,
depression
on
this
baby
girl
to
be
taken
from
her
parents,
and
the
court
specifically
said
all
of
that
was
legally
irrelevant
because
1912(f)
only
lets
you
look
at
the
harm
from
the
new
custodial
relationship;
it
doesn't
let
you
look
at
any
harm
from
the
breakup
of
the
previous
custodial
relationship.
and
all
of
that
would
make
sense
if
you
were
talking
about
912(f)'s
application
to
the
situations
it's
designed
for.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it's
miles
away.
and
it's
the
appropriate
standard
when
you're
taking
somebody
who
has
existing
legal
custody
and
depriving
them
of
it.
but
everywhere
in
the
law,
including
icwa,
when
you
make
an
initial
placement
of
a
child
in
a
new
custodial
setting,
you
don't
do
that
unless
you
look
at
the
child's
best
interest.
and
look
1916(a)
of
icwa,
which
is
the
only
provision
in
the
act
that
specifically
contemplates
a
child
being
placed
in
a
new
custodial
setting.
it
talks
about
what
happens
if
you
have
an
adoption
and
then
the
adoptive
parents
for
some
reason
terminate
their
rights
and
then
you
send
the
child
back
to
their
original
indian
custodian.
and
in
that
situation,
recognizing
that
when
there's
been
a
break
of
custody,
you
don't
just
send
somebody
off
to
a
--
a
new
setting
based
on
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt;
you
look
at
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
and
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
here
representing
the
guardian
who
represents
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
from
the
child's
perspective,
the
child
really
doesn't
care
whose
fault
it
was
when
they
were
brought
in
one
custodial
situation
or
another.
they
just
want
a
determination
that
focuses
on
at
the
relevant
time,
that
time,
what's
in
their
best
interest.
and
so
in
the
same
way
that
we
think
if
you
rule
in
our
favor
and
you
remand
to
the
lower
court
that
there
has
to
be
a
best
interest
determination
that
takes
into
account
the
current
situation,
notwithstanding
that
that
would
be
on
the
hypothesis
that
the
last
15
months
of
custody
were
based
on
a
legal
misunderstanding,
we
still
think
this
girl--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you
freeze
it
at
the
time
that
somebody's
talking
about--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you
freeze
it
at
the
time
that
somebody's
talking
about
changing
a
custodial
situation.
but
what
is
so
tragic
here
is
that
the
lower
court
applied
1912(d)
and
(f),
which
are
clearly
designed
for
a
situation
when
you're
contemplating
transferring
custody
away
from
an
existing
custodial
relationship.
they
looked
at
that
and
applied
those
inapposite
standards
to
create
a
transfer
to
somebody
with
new
custody.
now,
the
solicitor--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
we're
not
here
to
try
to
say
that
anybody
is
entitled
to
automatic
custody
of
this
child
based
on
some
legal
rule.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
absolutely.
and
i
would
hope
with
instructions
to
please
make
that
determination
as
quickly
as
humanly
possible.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
a
couple
of
things,
justice
kennedy.
if
you
got
to
the
point
of
applying
1915(a)
and
the
placement
preferences
--
and
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
they're
not
squarely
applicable
here,
because
the
birth
father's
argument
was
not
that
i
get
to
adopt,
but
that
i
have
an
entitlement
--
if
you
got
to
that,
i
think
the
good
cause
standard
gives
you
a
vehicle
for
importing
a
lot
of
best
interest
standards.
i
also
think
you
could
look--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
right,
but
even
the
justice
department
doesn't
say
that
the
guidelines
are
binding
or
entitled
to
anything
more
than
skidmore
deference,
and
i'd
take
constitutional
avoidance
over
skidmore
deference
any
day.
but
the
second
thing
i
would
put
on
the
table
is
i
think
the
fact
that
1916(a)
tells
you
that
the
one
time
you
are
thinking
about
transferring
custody,
congress
looked
to
the
best
interest
standard.
that's
a
good
hint
that
if
you
are
talking
about
transferring
custody
you
should
look
to
the
best
interests.
and,
again,
i
think
it's
imperative
to
look
at
1912(d),
(e),
and
(f).
as
the
government
and
the
solicitor
general
recognizes,
they
all
contemplate
continued
custody,
(e)
and
(f)
do.
now,
then
the
government
turns
around
and
says:
well,
but
(d)
was
a
basis
for
what
the
lower
court
did,
which
is
to
transfer
custody.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
government,
(d)
makes
even
less
sense
as
a
basis
for
transferring
custody
than
(f).
at
least
(f)
has
some
standard
designed
for
some
transfer
of
custody.
it
happens
to
be
the
wrong
transfer.
it's
the
transfer
away
from
continuing
custody
out
and
it's
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
(d)
has
no
standard
to
satisfy.
and
their
position
is
that
because
this
birth
father
was
not
presented
with
remedial
and
rehabilitative
services,
therefore,
because
he
didn't
get
remedial
services
that
presumably
he
needed,
he
gets
the
child.
that's
crazy.
and
what
it
shows
is
that
12(d)
assumes
that
it's
like
an
exhaustion
requirement,
and
unless
and
until
these
services
are
provided
you
preserve
the
status
quo
ante.
but
the
lower
court
didn't
preserve
the
status
quo
ante.
the
lower
court
ordered
this
poor
girl
sent
to
somebody
who,
at
least
under
state
law
and
just
a
matter
of
practicality,
is
a
stranger
to
her.
and
nowhere
in
the
law
do
you
see
any
child
being
transferred
to
a
new
custodial
arrangement
without
a
best
interest
determination.
and
why
did
it
happen
here?
it
happened
here
because
of
icwa,
which
by
its
terms
does
not
apply
to
these
situations,
and
it
happened
because
of
3/256ths
of
cherokee
blood.
now,
the
justice
department
back
in
1978
recognized
there
were
profound
constitutional
problems
with
the
statute.
then-assistant
assistant
attorney
general,
later
judge,
patricia
wald,
told
congress
that
there
were
applications
of
the
statute
that
raised
equal
protection
problems
because
they
treated
people
differently
solely
on
the
basis
of
race.
one
of
the
things
she
pointed
to
is
what
she
point
--
described
as
"the
(b)
portion
of
the
definition
of
“
indian
child
”.
"
and
that's
what
makes
this
child
an
indian
child
here,
its
biology,
its
biology
combined
with
the
fact
that
the
tribe,
based
on
a
racial
classification,
thinks
that
somebody
with
325
--
1
percent
indian
blood
is
enough
to
make
them
a
tribal
--
a
tribal
member,
eligible
for
tribal
membership.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
her
whole
world
changes
and
this
whole
inquiry
changes.
it
goes
from
an
inquiry
focused
on
her
best
interests
and
it
changes
to
a
focus
on
the
birth
father
and
whether
or
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger.
again,
that
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--you
correct
the
lower
court.
and
there's
two
paths
to
correct
the
lower
court.
one
way
to
correct
the
lower
court
is
to
say,
look
--
can
i
finish
the
answer?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
you
could
--
you
would
either
do
it
by
changing
the
definition
of
“
parent
”
and
recognize
that,
given
the
consequences
that
flow
from
a
parent
in
the
statute,
it
only
makes
sense
to
prove
something
more
than
bare
paternity.
or
you
could
do
it
by
recognizing
that
if
somebody
gets
in
the
front
door
of
this
statute
based
on
bare
paternity,
you
have
to
interpret
provisions
like
(d),
(e),
and
(f)
with
sensitivity
to
the
fact
that
under
that
reading
just
because
you
are
a
parent
doesn't
mean
you
have
these
kind
of
extraordinary
rights.
