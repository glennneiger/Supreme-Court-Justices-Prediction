justice

your
--
your
argument
assumes
that
the
phrase
in
the
statute
"to
prevent
the
breakup
of
the
indian
family.
"
only
applies
where
--
where
the
father
has
custody.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
why
that
should
be
true.
if
--
if
that's
what
congress
meant,
they
could
have
put
it
much
more
narrowly.
they
had
a
very
broad
phrase,
"to
prevent
the
break
up
of
an
indian
family.
"
and
this
guy
is
--
is
the
father
of
the
child--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
they're
taking
the
child
away
from
him
even
though
he
wants
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
--
that
is
not
the
breakup
of
--
of
an
indian
family?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
you're
reading
--
you're
reading
“
indian
family
”
to
mean
something
more
than
--
than
a
biological
relationship,
right?
you're
going
to
hang
a
lot
of
--
a
lot
of
other
ornaments
on
that
phrase?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
he's
the
father,
the
other
woman's
the
mother,
that's
the
--
that's
the
indian
family,
the
father,
the
mother,
and
the
kid.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
the
father.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
isn't
state
law.
this
is
a
federal
statute
which
uses
an
expansive
phrase,
"the
breakup
of
the
indian
family.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
we
believe
that
the
federal
statute
determines
when
he
has
parental
rights
by
defining
“
parent
”
to
include
a
biological
father.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
the
case,
then
what
you
said
doesn't
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
wanted
you
to
talk
about
(f).
are
you
going
to
say
something
about
that
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
you
going
to
leave
it
to
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
agree
with
the
government's
position,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
please
finish.
let's
finish.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
apply
a
“
best
interest
of
the
child
”
standard
to
a
termination
of
parental
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
can
--
can
--
i
know
a
lot
of
kids
that
would
be
better
off
with
different
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sure
is.
and
do
you
know
of
any
state
that
--
that
applies
best
interest
of
the
child
standard
to
termination
of
parental
rights
as
opposed
to
adoption?
justice
antonin
scalia
aren't
there
federal
definitions
of
approvals
of
tribes?
not
every
group
of
native
americans
who
get
together
can
call
themselves
a
tribe.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
isn't
one
of
the
conditions
of
that
a
condition
of
blood
and
not
--
not
of
voluntary
membership?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
quite
sure
that's
right.
so
i
think
the
hypothetical
is
--
is
a
null
set.
i
don't
think
it
ever
exists.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
my
recollection
correct
that
--
that
he
had
offered
to
--
to
marry
the
mother,
and
she
rejected
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
--
that
was
after
she
had
rejected
his
offer
to
marry
her,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
you
make
that
concession.
i
mean,
your
client
has
been
deprived
of
parental
rights.
i
do
not
know
that
--
that
it
is
traditional
to
decide
whether
a
parent
will
be
deprived
of
parental
rights
by
assessing
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
that
seems
to
me
quite--
justice
antonin
scalia
--extraordinary,
not
normal.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
that,
doesn't
it?
a
parent
is
--
is
the
--
the
biological
parent.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait.
i
didn't
understand.
citizenship,
who
has
acknowledged
citizenship?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
i
understand
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
very
strange
way
to
put
it.
i
mean,
just
--
just
in
passing
in
the
sentence,
that
“
the
continued
custody
”.
i
mean,
you
would
think
if
that's
what
they
meant,
they
would
say,
“
where
the
child
”
is
--
"is
within
the
custody
of
a
parent,
comma,
no
termination
of
parental
rights
may
be
ordered,
in
the
absence
of
a
determination.
"
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
"no
termination
may
be
ordered
in
absence
of
a
determination,
including
testimony
of
a
qualified
expert,
that
the
continued
custody
of
the
child
by
the
parent
or
indian
custodian
is
likely
to
result
in
serious
emotional.
"
when
it's
--
when
it's
framed
that
way,
i
am
--
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
“
continued
custody
”
means
looks
to
the
future,
the
continuing
custody
by
this
person
in
the
future.
to
read
into
it
the
fact
that
--
that
the
whole
provision
only
applies
to
someone
who
is
then
in
custody
of
the
child,
that's
very
strange.
that's
--
that's
not
the
way
somebody
would
write
a
provision
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
its
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that
that's
what
its
intent
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
only
applies
to
children
of
--
to
tribal
children.
and
--
and
the
purpose
was
to
establish
much
more
difficult
standards
for
the
adoption
of
--
of
a
child--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
maybe
you
--
you
disagree
with
that
policy,
but
that's
clearly
a
policy
behind
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
say
that.
it
--
its
definition
of--
