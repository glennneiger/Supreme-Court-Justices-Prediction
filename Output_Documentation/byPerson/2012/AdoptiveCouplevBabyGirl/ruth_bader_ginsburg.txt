but
he
didn't.
i
mean,
he
--
he
said
that
he
was
prepared
to
surrender
rights
to
the
mother,
but
not
to
a
stranger.
and
when
the
issue
of
adoption
came
up,
he
said:
"yes,
i
want
to
assert
my
parental
rights.
"
justice

where
does
it
--
where
is
there
a
reference
in
the
definition
of
“
parent
”
to
a
state
law?
i
see
the
--
which
is
the
section
which
defines
a
parent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
a
parent
means
a
biological
parent
of
an
indian
child,
and
he
fits
that
definition.
and
then
the
next
section
--
the
next
sentence
doesn't
have
any
reference
to
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
1915
preclude
the
adoptive
parents
because
they're
not
in
the
preferred
category?
if
1915(a)
precludes
the
adoption,
then
the
adoptive
parents
would
have
no
legal
basis
for
objecting
to
an
award
to
the
father.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
listed
under
the
--
there
are
guidelines
for
what
constitutes
good
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
now,
when
you
said
the
best
interest.
now
the
child
has
been
some
15
months
with
the
father.
so
if
a
best
interest
calculus
is
made
now,
you
would
have
to
take
into
account
uprooting
that
relationship,
would
you
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
--
even
though
the
guidelines
to
what's
good
cause
do
not
include
best
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
justice
breyer
is
quite
wrong
because
a
standard
that
says
results
in
serious
emotional
or
physical
damage
to
the
child
is
far
from
a
best
interest
standard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
definition
of
an
indian
child
is
just
straight
out
of
the
statute.
an
indian
child
is
someone
who
is
either
a
member
of
a
tribe
or
eligible,
and
is
the
biological
child
of
a
member
of
an
indian
tribe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
there's
some
ambiguity
there,
because
one
reason
why
he
wanted
to
marry
was
that
he
would
get
more
pay
and
allowances.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
would
be
out
under
south
carolina
law
because
he
didn't
support
the
child
during
the
pregnancy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
termination
of
parental
rights
requires
a
showing
that
it's
an
unfit
parent,
which
is
quite--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
whole
thrust
of
it,
you
--
this
is
directed
to
providing
remedial
services,
which
it
--
it
seems
that
it
fits
a
situation
where
someone
has
custody
but
is
having
problems
getting
his
or
her
act
together
so
needs
the
help
of
a
social
worker,
but
it
makes
no
sense
to
talk
about
remedial
services
for
someone
who
has
never
had
custody.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
might
is
what
provoked
the
act
that
indian
children
were
being
removed
from
their
families,
but
the
act
is
written
in
much
broader
terms.
