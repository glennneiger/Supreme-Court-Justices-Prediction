mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
definition
of
“
parent
”
under
the
act
because
i
think
a
lot
flows
from
that.
the
act
provides
that
a
parent
--
a
parent
of
an
indian
child
is
the
--
is
the
biological
parent,
except
where
the
child
--
or
where
the
parent
--
paternity
has
not
been
established
or
acknowledged.
here,
the
--
the
father's
paternity
was
acknowledged
and
established,
both
courts
below
found.
as
a
consequence,
he
has
not
simply
a
biological
relationship
to
the
child;
he
has
a
legal
relationship
to
the
child,
created
under
federal
law.
then--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--“
paternity
”
itself
is
in
a
biological
sense,
but
when--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
a
biological
sense.
but
the
establishment
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
it
does.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
once
--
in
the
unwed
father
situation,
once
the
father
establishes
or
acknowledges
paternity,
the
father
has
a
legal
relationship,
not
just
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
several
things
about
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
several
things
about
that.
first,
there
are
states
--
the
casey
amicus
brief
in
footnote
7
identifies
a
number
of
states
which
recognize
parental
rights
for
a
parent
who
has
established
or
acknowledged
citizenship.
so
the
state
law
varies
on
that.
and
this
was
the
--
one
of
the
very
problems
congress
was
concerned
about
with
respect
to
indian
children,
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry.
i
meant
to
say
paternity.
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
you
have
here
are
people
who
are
citizens
of
two
separate
sovereigns.
an
indian
tribe
is
a
sovereign
and
a
state.
congress
tried
to
accommodate
those
competing
interests
by
leaving
the
cases
in
state
court,
letting
them
be
subject
to
state
law,
but
subject
to
minimum
standards
to
protect
the
people
who
are
citizens
--
or
eligible
for
citizenship
in
the
indian
tribe.
that
is
a
classic
implementation
of
congress's
plenary
responsibility
in
the
federal
trust
and
guardianship
for
indians,
and
nothing
could
be
more
at
the
core
of
tribal
self-determination
and
tribal
survival
than
the
determination
of
tribal
membership
and
the
care
about
what
happens
to
indian
children.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it's
not
two
classes
of
parents.
it
comes
from
the
text
of
(f)
itself,
which
talks
about
continued
custody,
which
we
think
means
that
(f)
applies
--
it
presupposes
that
there
is
custody
to
continue.
and
that's
just
a
condition
on
the
termination
of
parental
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
--
i
grant
you
it
is
somewhat
awkwardly
written,
but
we
think
the
sense
of
it
is
--
is
that,
because
this
is
--
as
this
court
noted
in
the
santosky
decision,
this
is
a
very
unusual
statutory
provision
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
proof.
and
there
is
some
logic
for
congress
applying
this
--
this
--
where
there
is
a
custodial--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
--
there's
several
--
several
things
about
that
with
respect
to
the
rapist
and
the
sperm
donor.
in
the
35-year
history
of
this
statute--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no,
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
--
it's
not
as
anomalous
as
you're
suggesting
because
state
law
standards
still
apply,
and
under
state
law
standard
under
santosky,
there
has
to
be
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
terminate
--
to
apply
the
state
termination
of
parental
rights
provisions,
which
is
what
the
family
court
did
in
this
case.
this
is
--
this
is
a
federal
overlay,
an
additional
requirement.
if
i
could,
though,
move
on
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
so,
because
custody
is
in
the
one
and
--
and
not
in
the
other.
(d)
speaks
of
breakup
of
--
of
the
family
relationship.
and
i
think
there,
the
family
relationship,
because
it
--
it
speaks
of
termination
of
parental
rights,
which
is
in
turn
defined
in
the
act
as
anything
that
terminates
the
parent-child
relationship,
which
--
which
can
be
much
broader
than
--
than
whether
the
parent
actually
has
custody,
which
is
the
word
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
that's
--
that
is
precisely
the
point
when
icwa
kicks
in.
icwa
does
not
try
to
regulate
the
relationship
between
the
mother
and
the
father.
that
is
--
that
is
left
to
state
law
or
tribal
law.
icwa
kicks
in
only
when
there's
going
to
be
an
adoption
or
a
termination
of
rights
and
the
child
is
going
to
be
placed
outside
of
--
of
the
relationship.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
their
burden
is
to
demonstrate
that
that
has
happened.
the
remedial--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
family
court
could
direct
that
remedial
service
--
this
--
this
happens,
i
think,
frequently
in
family
court,
is
the
remedial
services
--
this
is
not
an
unusual
provision.
much
state
family
law
provides
for
this.
the
state
court
can
oversee
the
--
the
remedial
services
and
that
could
have
been
done
in
this
--
in
this
case.
