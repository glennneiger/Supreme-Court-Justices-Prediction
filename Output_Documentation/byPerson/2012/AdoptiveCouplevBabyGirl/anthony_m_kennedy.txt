justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
--
in
your
view,
at
what
point,
at
what
date
did
the
indian
father
lose
the
right
to
ask
for
custody?
because
he
changed
his
mind
in
--
in
january,
there
was
about
a
5-day
period
there.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
adoption
proceedings
had
not
concluded.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
at
this
point
he
said,
in
effect:
i've
changed
my
mind.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
state
law
determines
when
his
rights
under
the
federal
act
end?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
even
in
that
sense,
serious
emotional
and
physical
damage
is
a
much
different
threshold
than
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
even
on
the
statutory
terms.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
--
and
i
take
it
you'll
say
that
that
goes
back
to
this
south
carolina
court
if
you
prevail?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
best
interest
of
the
child
is
the
uniformly
accepted
standard
in
state
courts,
and
if
we
forget
constitutional
avoidance
problems
which
i
--
i
think
exist
here,
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
allows
us
to
import
the
best
interests
of
the
child
into
the
statutory
language,
or
do
we
have
to
just
rely
on
constitutional
avoidance
and
--
and
really
rewrite
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
do
you
--
you
want
us
to
write
the
case
as
if
this
is
just
a
standard
best
interest
determination
and
--
and
this
federal
statute
is
irrelevant?
i
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
these
--
these
considerations
are
why
domestic
relations
pose
the
hardest
problems
for
judges.
our
domestic
relations
judges
all
by
themselves
every
day
have
these
difficult
problems.
if
we
could
appoint
king
solomon,
who
was
the
first
domestic
relations
judge,
as
special
master,
we
could
do
it.
but
we
can't
do
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
--
is
that
true
under
south
carolina
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
south
carolina
law
in
this
adoption
proceeding,
the
--
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
statute,
the
best
interest
of
the
child
standard
would
not
have
applied?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
--
did
you
--
at
your
--
when
you
began,
do
you
use
“
paternity
”
in
the
biological
sense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
--
as
you
--
as
you
interpret
the
statute,
“
paternity
is
the
biological
sense
”,
not
--
not
an--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
an
existing
parental
relationship.
