justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
simplify
that?
what
do
you
think
the
elements
of
--
just
going
back
to
what
justice
scalia
said,
as
i
understand
your
position
the
elements
of
a
burglary
in
california
law
is
being
in
a
place
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
whether
you
got
there
with
permission
or
without
permission,
unlawfully
or
not,
is
irrelevant.
so
what
you
are
saying
is
what
he
pled
guilty
to
was
being
in
that
garage
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
unlawfulness
is
not
necessary.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
matter
what
he
said,
he
wasn't
convicted
of
a
generic
crime
because
all
he
was
convicted
of
under
california
law
was
entering
and--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--with
intent.
that's
your
point.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
my
problem,
which
is
you
say
that,
but
how
to
define
a
missing
element
from
an
alternative
element
is
--
overbroad
element,
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
as
i
read
the
california
statute,
all
it
says
is
you
have
to
enter
a
number
of
defined
things
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
it
doesn't
talk
about
whether
the
entry
itself
is
unlawful.
that's
your
colleague's
--
your
opponent's
argument.
but
you're
trying
to
read
into
the
method
of
entering
that
it
could
be
legal
or
illegal,
and
so
you
look
at
the
documents
to
add
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
you
take
that
position
and
advocate
the
answer
you're
giving
here?
because
you
are
asking
us
to
determine
or
to
have
courts
below
determine
what
are
or
are
not
definitions
that
the
judiciary
is
applying
to
means
versus
mode,
et
cetera?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
the
difference
is
between
entering
the
garage
with
permission
and
taking
a
wrench
and
walking
out,
and
entering
a
store
with
permission
and
taking
an
article
of
clothing.
are
they
both
shoplifting?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
are
the
same
thing.
so
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
you
do
admit
that
under
the
california
definition
of
burglary,
shoplifting
could
be
charged.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
your
adversary
can
speak
for
himself,
and
his
brief
did
point
to
some
convictions
for
shoplifting
under
the
statute.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
are
some.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
johnson,
the
last
answer
by
mr.
horwich
to
the
last
question
was,
it
would
be
simpler
if
we
hadn't
done
the
modified
categorical
approach;
but
the
reality
is
we
have
a
statute.
the
active
statute
that
defines
violent
felony
not
with
respect
to
a
felony
that
involved
dangerous
conduct,
but
as
any
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
that
has
an
element
that
threatened
use
of
physical
force.
so
it's
not
what
the
court
created,
it's
what
the
statute
created.
