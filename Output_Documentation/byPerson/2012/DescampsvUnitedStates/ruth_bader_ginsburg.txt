you
don't
take
issue,
do
you,
with
the
argument
that
in
determining
what
the
state
law
is
you
can
take
account
not
only
of
the
words
of
the
statute,
but
how
the
state
supreme
court
interprets
those
words?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
--
let's
get
back
to
this
case.
i
think
what
you're
saying
about
the
plea
colloquy
is,
even
if
he
had
said
to
the
judge,
yes,
i
broke
and
entered
the
metro
mart,
even
if
he
had
said
that,
the
conviction
still
would
not
be
for
burglary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
probably
an
obvious
answer
to
this,
but
the
taylor
definition
of
generic
burglary
is
unlawful
entry
into
or
remaining
in
a
building
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
why
doesn't
this,
the
crime
of
which
the
defendant
was
convicted,
satisfy
the
remaining,
the
remaining
in
the
building
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
--
that
intent
would
continue
while
the
person
remains
in
the
building.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
breaking
and
entering
--
in
your
brief
as
i
understand
it
you
are
not
relying
on
the
prosecutor's
charge
that
there
was
breaking
and
entering.
you're
relying
entirely
on
the
plea
colloquy.
and
in
this
plea
colloquy,
the
prosecutor
said:
he
broke
and
entered
a
grocery
store.
he
says
nothing.
in
the
typical
rule
11
setting,
when
the
judge
goes
through
the
series
of
questions,
the
judge
doesn't
take
the
defendant's
silence.
the
defendant
has
to
positively
affirm.
and
here
we
have
a
plea
colloquy
where
the
prosecutor
says
something
and
the
defendant
doesn't
respond.
why
is
that
any
kind
of
a
necessary
admission
when
he
said
nothing,
which
he
might
have
done
under
the
impression
that
it
didn't
matter
because
he
had
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
it
be
different
than
in
the
rule
11
colloquy?
why
shouldn't
there
be
--
if
--
if
this
is
going
to
determine
whether
there's
a
crime
qualifying
under
acca,
why
should
it
be
enough
that
the
prosecutor
said
something?
why
shouldn't
the
defendant
have
to
say:
yes,
i
broke
and
entered
the
grocery
store?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
charge
it
as
what?
what's
shoplifting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
--
but
it
does
come
under
this
section
459.
