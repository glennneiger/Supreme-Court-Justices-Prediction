suppose
the
court
were
to
say:
we
now
hold
that
the
modified
categorical
approach
applies
to
this
statute
and
to
these
facts.
would
the
plea
colloquy
suffice
to
show
that
under
the
modified
categorical
approach
the
defendant
necessarily
was
convicted
of
a
crime
that's
equivalent
to
the
generic
crime
of
burglary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
he
necessarily--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
defendant
necessarily
was
convicted
of
an
offense
that
had
the
elements
of
a
generic
crime,
if
he
necessarily
was
convicted
of
that,
would
that
suffice?
and
if
it
would,
does
the
plea
colloquy
suffice
to
show
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
a
two-part
question.
i
hope
i
can
get
an
answer
to
each.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
under
the
modified
categorical
approach
we
insist
that
in
the
particular
case
before
us
the
generic
components
of
the
crime
must
necessarily
have
been
found
by
the
jury,
and
if
we
say
that
that's
the
rule,
that's
inconsistent
with
your
view
of
what
the
law
ought
to
be?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
the
modified
categorical
approach
the
whole
point
is
that
we
do
look
to
the
plea
colloquy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
which
is
why
you
say
you
don't
think
the
modified
categorical
approach
should
apply.
but
i'm
saying
suppose
we
say
that
it
does
and
we
look
at
the
plea
colloquy.
what
do
you
want
us
to
conclude
from
that?
