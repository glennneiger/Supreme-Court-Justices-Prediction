justice

but
i
thought
our
cases
held
that
when
you
have
a
conviction
for
a
weapons
violation,
you
can
look
to
the
shepard
materials
to
decide
whether,
in
fact,
the
weapon
violation
was
a
gun,
a
knife
or
an
ax,
can't
you?
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
if
--
you
acknowledge
if
the
state
supreme
court
says
“
weapon
”
could
mean
a
gun,
a
knife
or
a
hatchet,
that
would
--
that
would
suffice,
right?
but
if
the
supreme
court
doesn't
say
that,
we
cannot
imagine
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
spelled
out
as
an
element,
but
the
state
supreme
court
says,
our
statute
says
weapon.
of
course,
a
weapon
could
be
a
gun,
a
knife,
or
a
hatchet,
and
then
we
look
to
the
shepard
documents
and
we
find
that
this
conviction
of
a
weapons
violation
was
in
fact
based
on
the
possession
of
a
gun.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you're
saying
is,
it
--
it
could
necessarily
have
been
found
by
the
jury,
but
he
would
nevertheless
not
have
been
convicted
of
that
particular
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
jury
in
finding
him
guilty
of
the
generic
offense
could
only
have
found
that
this
mode
of
committing
the
offense
was
what
he
used.
nonetheless,
he
has
not
been
convicted
of
using
that
mode;
he
has
been
convicted
of
the
generic
offense.
isn't
that
your
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
--
maybe
they
haven't
argued
it
because
there's
some
serious
constitutional
doubt
about
whether
the
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
engage
in
conduct
which
creates
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury
is
constitutional.
that's
such
a
vague
standard,
you
go
to
prison
for
30
years
if
you
engage
in
conduct,
quote,
"that
creates
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury.
"
i'm
not
about
to
buy
into
that
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
strange
to
me
at
all.
he
hasn't
been
convicted
of
raping
or
having
intercourse
with
somebody
under
--
under
14
or
under
15.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
only
been
convicted
of
having
that
with
someone
under
18.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
everything
the
jury
finds
constitutes
a
conviction.
they
have
to
find
something
that
is
an
element
of
the
charged
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
being
--
being
under
16
is
not
--
or
14,
whatever
it
is,
is
not
an
element
of
the
charged
offense,
i
don't
care
what
the
jury
finds.
justice
antonin
scalia
qui
tacet
consentire
videtur.
why
don't
you
quote
the
maxim?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
who
remains
silent
appears
to
consent.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
advise
defendants
who
--
who
anticipate
committing
these
crimes,
so
that
they
will
know
which
crimes
carry
another
30
years.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
have
to
prove
--
i
mean,
burglary
is
specifically
named.
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
residual--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
not
the
residual.
the
--
the
use
or
threatened
use
of
force
is
the
residual.
if
you're
convicted
of
burglary,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
--
whether
you
threaten
force,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
only
--
only
those
burglaries
that
--
that
threaten
force
are
covered
by
the
statute?
certainly
not.
it's
all
burglaries,
as
long
as
you
meet
the
generic
definition
of
burglary,
right?
