chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-9540,
descamps
v.
united
states.
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
not
california's
problem,
right?
we're
talking
about
federal
legislation
and
how
that
operates.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
horwich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
point
would
expand
--
this
would
expand
the
problem
that
you've
identified,
that
the
shepard
approach,
the
existence
of
the
documents,
how
carefully
they've
been
developed,
it
would
expand
that
fortuity
to
a
far
greater
number
of
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it
achieves
greater
sentencing
equity
when
you
have
two
defendants
who
have
done
exactly
the
same
thing
in
california,
and
because
of
the
fortuity
of
what
the
plea
colloquy
looked
like
in
one
case
as
opposed
to
another,
when
it
really
didn't
matter
one
way
or
another
in
that
situation,
one
person
qualifies
under
acca
and
the
other
doesn't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
presumably
i
agree
that
you
don't
have
--
you
don't
have
empirical
evidence.
but
given
how
--
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it's
a
broad
expansion
of
the
category
of
cases
to
which
you
would
apply
the
modified
categorical
approach
under
your
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
johnson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-9540,
descamps
versus
united
states.
