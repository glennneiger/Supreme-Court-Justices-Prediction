justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
is
there's
no
way.
this
is
purely
conceptual.
a
state
supreme
court
that
says
the
word
“
weapon
”
in
the
statute
means
knife,
ax,
or
gun.
now,
are
those
three
ways
of
committing
the
crime?
or
are
they
three
crimes,
each
with
a
separate
element?
that
is
--
we'd
need
not
only
st.
thomas
aquinas,
but
i
mean,
we'd
need
those
angels
dancing
on
the
head
of
a
pin.
there
is
no
difference
that
i
can
imagine.
and
therefore
you
are
saying,
look
to
the
point
of
this
statute;
it
is
not
to
look
to
the
individual
way
in
which
it
was
committed,
and
therefore
go
to
the
statute
to
see
whether
you
have
a
single
crime
or
separate
crimes,
okay?
that's
that's
what
i
think
your
argument
is.
do
you
think
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
i
understand
your
argument
--
it's
not
as
friendly
a
question
as
you
might
hope,
because
what
i
want
to
do
next
is
say:
why
are
we
debating
this
point,
because
the
only
difference
i
can
see
under
the
california
statute
is
shoplifting
and
even
that
one
is
sort
of
debatable.
and
the
very
next
clause
of
this
statute
says
“
or
otherwise
”,
"or
otherwise
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury.
"
so
why
not
forget
about
this
metaphysical
point
and
say,
look,
even
if
you
are
totally
right,
you've
still
got
a
statute
for
430,000
convictions
and
as
far
as
we
can
tell
there
must
have
been
fewer
than
500
that
involved
shoplifting,
so
this
is
so
much
like
burglary
that
whatever
risks
were
presented
by
burglary
are
surely
present
here.
so
let's
forget
the
metaphysics
and
just
go
on
to
clause
2.
now,
why
hasn't
anybody
done
that?
it's
a
mystery
to
me,
because
you
haven't
and
they
haven't.
so
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
but
i
mean,
what
i
would
do
--
i've
said
this
and
nobody
pays
any
attention.
i
think
justice
scalia's
said
it;
nobody
pays
any
attention.
i
think
justice
posner
said
it.
he
said:
look,
under
clause
2,
these
are
really
empirical
questions,
is
this
dangerous
or
not.
let's
do
a
little
sampling
and
what
we'll
do
is
we'll
sample
the
kinds
of
people
that
this
particular
state
statute
x
get
convicted
under
and
where
a
whole
lot
of
them
are
dangerous
it's
a
dangerous
statute;
and
where
not,
not.
and
so
nobody's
done
that
sampling,
but
we
do
have
some
numbers
here
and
the
numbers
here
suggest
that
this
is
really
a
burglary
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
you
could.
i
just
don't
think
there
are
that
many
people
who
burgle
their
own
names
or
who
go
into
the
home
of
somebody
else
with
an
invitation
and
then
sneak
into
the
cupboard
and
stay
overnight
and
burgle
everything.
i
mean,
there
are
some
such,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no.
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
that.
it
has
to
do
with
the
crime
and
the
crime
is
the
crime
that
the
statute
defines.
and
the
question
is,
is
that
crime
otherwise
--
present
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury?
and
if
4,000
manifestations
of
that
crime
it
does,
and
3
manifestations
of
that
crime
it
doesn't,
you
would
say
the
overall
judgment
here
is
this
is
a
crime
that
does
present
that
dangerous
risk.
that's
because
in
almost
all
cases
it's
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it's
exactly
pure
categorical.
you
have
a
crime
in
a
statute.
you
don't
know
how
dangerous
it
is.
it
is
not
burglary,
arson
or
explosives.
so
to
find
out
if
it
presents
the
same
kind
of
danger
you
do
a
little
empirical
research.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
categorical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
“
is
burglary
or
otherwise
”,
“
or
otherwise
”,
“
burglary
or
otherwise
”,
and
the
reason
we
have
“
or
otherwise
”
is
because
congress
does
know
that
the
number
of
state
statutes
that
are
sort
of
like
something
but
not
completely
like
something
is
in
the
thousands.
and
so
that's
why
they
put
in
“
or
otherwise
”.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
it's
like
the
old
joke.
i
mean,
it's
in
the
statute,
you
are
looking
back
to
see
whether
he
was
charged
with
possession
of
a
gun,
which
is
one
word
in
the
statute,
or
an
ax,
or
a
knife.
that's
what
we're
looking
for
under
the
categorical
--
modified
categorical.
but
if
all
it
says
in
the
statute
is
weapon,
even
if
the
supreme
court
says
it's
a
gun,
a
knife,
or
an
ax,
you
still
have
nothing
to
look
for.
because
the
charge
to
the
jury
could
have
been,
did
he
have
a
gun,
a
knife,
or
an
ax,
and
the
answer
to
that
question,
when
the
jury
comes
back,
would
be
yes.
you
see?
all
they
have
to
say
is
yes.
they
don't
have
to
say
which.
and
therefore,
apprendi
would
be
violated,
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
not
--
but
you're
not
looking
at
the
factual
basis
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
committed
the
crime.
you're
looking
to
the
factual
basis
or
you
look
to
these
other
documents
in
order
to
decide
which
crime
it
was
that
the
offender
committed.
and
the
reason
that
you
have
to
sometimes
do
that
is
because
there
are
many
state
statutes
which
under
a
single
section
number
list
several
different
crimes,
where
“
crime
”
here
does
not
refer
to
a
thing
that
happened
at
a
particular
day
at
a
particular
time,
but
refers
to
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
statute
defines;
i.e.,
a
general
category.
now,
every
case
that
we've
written
it
seems
to
me
says
that
or
is
consistent
with
that.
and
that
is
certainly
consistent
with
the
idea
of
the
crimes
being
burglary,
arson,
explosives,
or
other
dangerous
crimes.
so
the
guilty
plea
is
beside
the
point.
it
may
just
say:
guilty
of
828
376
section
42-bc,
end
of
the
matter.
and
we
don't
know
which
of
those
three
things:
house,
car,
boat,
which
are
there
in
that
section,
was
the
crime
committed.
and
he's
saying
that's
the
end
of
that.
and
so
he
says,
then,
look,
this
is
a
california
state
statute
and
it
isn't
divided
into
three
parts.
it
just
has
one
part.
and
that
one
part
is
not
the
equivalent--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
federal
burglary
as
defined
by
justice
blackmun
and
the
court
in
this
case,
end
of
matter,
qed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
right.
so
therefore,
that
was
my
question
basically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
of
course
congress
knew
that
there
are
hundreds
or
thousands
of
state
statutes
with
several
different
words
and
they
--
you
know,
different
ways
of
getting
at
the
same
thing,
and
therefore
they
wrote
the
next
phrase
of
their
federal
statute,
which
is
it's
burglary,
arson,
explosives
or
otherwise,
or
otherwise
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury.
and
so
if
you
have
a
slight
variation
on
the
burglary
theme,
it
doesn't
fit
within
generic
burglary,
but
it's
pretty
hard
to
imagine
it
wouldn't
otherwise
present
the
same
risks,
at
least
if
it's
only
a
slight
variation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
and
that
was
my
question.
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
true.
but
what
they
said
in
gauze
is
that
the
entry
must
invade
a
possessory
right
in
a
building.
and
that
cuts
in
your
favor,
because
that's
not
having
different
ways
of
committing
a
crime,
that's
what
the
word
in
the
statute
means.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
now
you're
ahead.
but
the
difficulty
i
think
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
invading
a
possessory
interest
includes
--
includes
going
into
a
shop
with
an
intent
to
steal
something,
a
shoplifter.
now,
you
could
go
back
to
the
blackmun
opinion
and
you
can
say:
ah,
that
falls
right
within
it,
because
generic
burglary
is
defined
in
part
there
to
include
generic,
an
unprivileged
remaining
in
the
building.
and
you
say:
you
see,
these
are
the
same.
were
it
not
for
two
facts.
the
first
fact
is
in
shepard
it
seems
as
if
the
court
says
shoplifting
is
not
burglary.
and
then
you
look
to
the
treatise
that
they
cite
for
that,
which
is
lafave,
and
lafave
makes
that
even
more
clear.
and
says:
no,
when
you
talk
about
remaining,
what
we're
thinking
of
is
hiding
in
a
bank
and
not
going
into
what
used
to
be
jordan
marsh
and
staying
overnight,
or
not
even
staying
overnight,
but
just
putting
a
few
toothbrushes
in
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's
where
the
problem
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
but
now,
once
you
conflate
those
you
are
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
quickly
ask
you
this
then,
you
say
look
at
gauze
for
this
reason,
it
makes
clear
that
in
these
words
of
the
california
statute,
there
must
be
an
interference
with
possessory
interest.
now,
i
go
back
and
read
the
blackmun
opinion,
and
it
says
the
element
of
generic
burglary
includes
an
unprivileged
entry
or
remaining
into
a
building.
you
say
now,
between
those
two
forms
of
words,
there
is
virtually
no
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
one
possible
difference
is
shoplifting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
as
to
shoplifting,
here
is
what
i
would
like
to
say.
this
is
you,
okay?
not
me.
shoplifting
just
is
not
a
factor
under
california
code
section
459.
now,
you
have
not
added
those
last
words;
and
therefore,
i
begin
to
think
maybe
it
is
a
factor.
and
if
it
is
a
factor,
then
i'm
afraid
i'm
then
leaning
in
favor
of
saying
there
is
a
big
difference
in
the
california
statute
in
generic
burglary.
but
if
you
could
tell
me,
no,
there
are
other
shoplifting
statutes,
this
is
never
or
hardly
ever
used
for
shoplifting,
then
maybe
i
would
feel
differently
about
it,
and
say,
oh,
it's
close
enough.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see
why
i
turn
back
to
the
empirical
question
and
keep
wondering,
why
is
it
not
possible
to
get,
say,
a
law
professor;
they
have
spare
time
--
get
the
sentencing
committee,
get
someone
to
look
and
see
what
are
the
real
behaviors
that
are
convicted
under
section
459.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
