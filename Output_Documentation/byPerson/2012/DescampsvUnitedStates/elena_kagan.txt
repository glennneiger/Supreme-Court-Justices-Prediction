justice
elena
kagan
mr.
johnson,
can
i
try
what
justice
alito
is
getting
at
maybe
in
a
slightly
a
different
way.
and
it's
really
the
argument
that
the
ninth
circuit
made,
which
is
that
you
can
take
any
indivisible
statute,
indivisible
statute,
and
you
can
reimagine
it
as
a
statute
with
divisible
elements,
and
justice
alito
gave
one
example
of
that.
and
the
question
to
the
ninth
circuit
says,
is,
once
we've
said
that
we
can
look
to
shepard
documents
when
we
have
a
divisible
statute,
why
not
apply
the
same
reasoning
when
we
have
an
indivisible
statute,
given
that
any
indivisible
statute
can
kind
of
be
reframed
in
our
heads
as
a
divisible
one?
justice
elena
kagan
and
so
your
principal
argument
isn't
that
--
is
that
what
we've
said
in
the
modified
categorical
cases
is
that
you
look
to
these
shepard
documents
to
help
you
define
the
elements
of
the
offense.
so
if
you're
not
sure
which
offense
the
person
has
been
convicted
of,
you
look
to
the
shepard
documents
to
do
that.
but
you
don't
look
to
the
shepard
documents
for
a
different
purpose,
which
is,
we
know
what
the
elements
of
the
offense
are,
but
we
want
to
know
whether
this
person
also
committed
the
generic
offense.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
i
think
--
here's,
i
guess,
the
rub,
which
is
--
you
know,
i
take
the
point
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
does
not
seem
very
categorical.
it
doesn't
seem
categorical,
it
doesn't
seem
modified
categorical.
but
there
is
something
a
little
bit
insane
about
your
position.
i
don't
see
--
you
take
the
most
populous
state
in
the
country
and
everybody
who's
convicted
of
burglary
in
the
most
populous
state
in
the
country
is
not
going
to
have
committed
an
acca
offense,
even
though,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
98
percent
of
them
really
have.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
horwich--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
going
to
ask
you
about
an
argument
you
did
make.
justice
elena
kagan
as
i
understand
your
argument,
your
argument
is
not
the
ninth
circuit's
argument,
because
you
very
carefully
distinguish
what
are
what
you
call
missing
elements
cases
from
this
case.
justice
elena
kagan
so
do
you
reject
the
ninth
circuit's
view
that
the
categorical
approach
should
apply
even
where
there
is
a
missing
element,
as
you
--
as
you
call
it?
justice
elena
kagan
let
me
give
you
a
--
let
me
give
you
a
different
kind
of
example.
let's
suppose
you
have
a
statute
that's
made
it
illegal
to
interfere
with
a
law
enforcement
investigation.
and
you're
prosecuting
somebody,
maybe
the
person
is
pleading,
maybe
he
goes
to
trial;
it
doesn't
matter.
the
theory
of
the
case
is
that
the
defendant
violated
this
statute,
interference
with
a
law
enforcement
investigation,
by
assaulting
a
police
officer,
okay?
is
that
a
missing
elements
case
or
is
that
what
you
think
is
going
on
here,
which
is
just
--
it's
just
an
overbroad
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
the
conviction
is
interference
with
a
law
enforcement
investigation.
that's
the
statute.
but
interference
with
a
law
enforcement
investigation
can
be
done
in
extremely
--
it
can
be
done
in
an
extremely
violent
way,
which
would
be
an
acca
offense
or
not.
justice
elena
kagan
and
it's
overbroad.
there
are
acca
offenses
in
it,
but
there
are
also
non-acca
offenses
in
it.
justice
elena
kagan
sure.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
would
there
be
any
difference
between
those
two?
why
would
you
take
your
argument
differently
from
the
residual
clause
than
in
the
enumerated
crimes?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
well,
let
me
--
let's
talk
about
this
case,
then.
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
that
quite.
but
let's
talk
about
the
burglary.
suppose
that
there
was
a
state
that
just
said
entry.
in
other
words,
this
state
says
unlawful
entry
and
you
say
that's
overbroad,
but
we're
still
in
sort
of
the
same
universe
of
an
element.
suppose
the
state
just
said
entry.
would
we
be
in
a
missing
element
world
or
in
an
overbroad
world?
justice
elena
kagan
but
this
reading
creates
its
own
idiosyncrasies.
i
mean,
suppose
the
same
plea
colloquy
had
taken
place
and
the
prosecutor,
instead
of
saying,
you
know,
the
defendant
broke
and
entered,
he
had
said:
the
defendant
unlawfully
entered,
right?
completely
different
result
under
your
theory;
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
a
deeper
problem
than
that,
because
the
defendant
is
standing
there
and
he
doesn't
care
at
all
whether
the
prosecutor
says
unlawfully
entered
or
broke
and
entered.
it
doesn't
matter
a
whit
to
him.
and
so
--
and
so
something
is
--
is--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
difference
between
an
enhanced
sentence
and
not
an
enhanced
sentence
that
is
not
likely
to
be
thought
about,
let
alone
adjudicated.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
it
depends
on
whether
the
basis
has
any
relevance
to
the
punishment
he's
going
to
receive,
which
in
this
case
it
doesn't,
but
put
that
aside.
here's
one
thing
that
strikes
me
as
odd
about
your
position.
you
said
before
in
response
to
a
question
--
you
said
if
the
california
supreme
court
had
not
decided
gauze,
then
you
would
not
be
up
here
arguing
what
you're
arguing.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
no
unlawful
entry
that
counted
under
california
law--
justice
elena
kagan
--but,
you
know,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
strange
gauze
case
which
says
that
you
can't
burglarize
your
own
home
--
right
--
the
fact
that
the
court
happens
to
come
across
that
case
and
happens
to
decide
--
it
seems
completely
irrelevant
as
to
this
matter
whether
or
not
the
california
court
once
decided
that
you
can't
burglarize
your
own
home.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
anything
in
this
case?
justice
elena
kagan
this
is
a
case
about
a
federal
statute
called
acca,
the
armed
career
criminal
act,
possibly
not
what
you're
here
for
this
morning.
acca,
we've
had
many
disagreements
about
acca
over
the
years,
i
think
one
thing
we
would
all
agree
on
is
that
acca
is
not
a
very
well
written
statute.
and
because
it's
not
very
well
written,
it's
hard
to
apply
and
because
it's
hard
to
apply,
it
takes
up
a
lot
more
of
our
time
than
we
would
like.
so,
what
is
acca?
acca
is
a
sentence
enhancer.
certain
people
who
are
convicted
of
being
a
felon
with
a
firearm
that
usually
has
a
10-year
maximum
sentence,
but
that
sentence
can
get
enhanced
if
the
person
has
committed
three
violent
felonies.
and
it
can
get
enhanced
by
quite
a
bit
so
that
the
sentence
ends
up,
in
this
case,
more
than
double
what
it
otherwise
would
be.
the
question
that
acca
often
presents
is
how
we
figure
out
whether
a
prior
felony
is
one
of
the
three
prior
felonies
that
you
can
count
under
acca.
what
the
statute
does
is
it
lists
a
number
of
crimes.
it
lists
burglary
and
arson
and
extortion.
who
knows
why
those
three
and
then
it
has
something
called
a
“residual
clause”,
sort
of
a
kitchen
sink
clause,
which
gives
us
a
lot
of
difficulties
too,
but
this
case
is
about
one
of
the
listed
crimes.
it's
about
burglary
and
what
you
might
think
is,
“well,
that's
pretty
easy.
all
you
have
to
do
was
look
to
see
whether
a
person
has
been
convicted
of
burglary
and
that
gets
counted
as
one
of
the
three,”
what
are
called
“predicate
offenses,”
but
in
fact,
it's
not
that
easy
for
reasons
that
this
case
demonstrates.
that
is
because
different
states
define
burglary
very
differently.
so
in
some
states,
it's
like
the
classic
breaking
and
entering,
and
that
we
think
is
exactly
the
kind
of
violent
felony
that
congress
meant
to
count
as
one
of
these
three
predicate
offenses.
but
in
some
cases,
in
some
states,
burglary
covers
a
much
wider
range
of
conduct.
it
also
covers
shoplifting.
and
we
think
actually
that
that's
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
meant
to
count
to
so
greatly
enhance
peoples'
sentences
and
that's
what's
true
in
this
case.
the
california
burglary
statute,
which
this
case
is
about,
defines
burglary
very
widely
to
include
not
just
breaking
and
entering
but
also
to
include
shoplifting.
and
the
question
that
we've
encountered
is
what
to
do
with
the
statute
like
that.
there
are
two
approaches
that
you
can
follow:
the
first
approach
is
called
the
“factual
approach”.
let's
call
it.
and
that
would
involve
looking
to
what
the
person
actually
did
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
the
person,
in
fact,
did
something
that
looks
like
breaking
and
entering
or
did
something
that
looks
like
shoplifting.
but
we've
explained
in
many
opinions
that
there
are
real
problems
with
that
approach.
and
the
problems
are,
we
don't
think
congress
meant
for
us
to
take
that
approach.
we've
looked
at
the
text
of
the
acca
statute
and
it
seems
as
though
that's
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
we've
said
that
there
are
real
constitutional
problems
with
that
approach
as
well
because
it
would
involve
judges
making
determinations
about
what
a
defendant
actually
did,
but
in
our
system,
properly
belong
to
juries.
so
we
said
that
that's
another
problem
with
it
and
we've
said
also
that
there
are
real
practical
problems
with
it
because
it's
hard
to
figure
out
what
somebody
actually
did
sometimes
many,
many,
years
ago,
many
decades
ago
even,
it's
inefficient
and
it
may
very
well
be
unfair.
so,
instead
of
adopting
that
approach,
we've
adopted
something
called
the
“categorical
approach”
and
what
we
do
is
we
figure
out
something
that
we
called
the
“generic
crime
of
burglary”.
we
say,
“what's
mostly
what
burglary
is?”
and
mostly,
what
burglary
is
and
what
we
think
congress
had
in
mind
is
breaking
and
entering.
and
then
we
compare
the
elements
of
that
crime,
the
generic
offence
to
the
elements
of
the
crime
that
the
person
was
convicted
of.
so
because
--
if
the
person
was
convicted
of
a
crime
that's
much
broader
than
the
generic
offense,
we've
said
that
that
conviction
cannot
count
under
acca
because
we
don't
really
know.
the
person
might
have
been
--
in
fact
actually
committed
breaking
and
entering
or
the
person
might
have
committed
just
shoplifting,
and
we
don't
to
use
the
factual
approach
for
all
the
reasons
that
i've
said.
so,
we
basically
just
say
that
the
conviction
doesn't
count
under
acca.
and
that
means
that
there
are
some
criminals
who
get
a
break,
but
we've
decided
that
that's
the
better
approach
to
take
than
the
alternative.
now,
what
i've
said
basically
resolves
this
case
because
here,
the
defendant
is
named
michael
descamps
and
he
was
convicted
for
burglary
under
california
law
and
the
question
is,
“can
that
conviction
count
as
an
acca
predicate
offense?”
and
we
–
and
--
the
categorical
approach
would
say,
“no.
it
can't
count
because
in
california
law,
burglary
includes
all
these
non-violent
things
and
so,
it
can't
count,
case
closed.”
now,
what
the
courts
below
did
was
that
they
said
that
the
case
was
not
closed.
they
said
that
they
could
look
beyond
the
elements
of
the
crime
that
mr.
descamps
was
convicted
of,
as
long
as
it
only
considered
certain
generally
reliable
documents:
indictments,
jury
trial,
jury
charges,
plea
agreements,
and
plea
colloquies
to
see
what
mr.
descamps
really
did,
to
see
whether
he
in
fact
broke
and
entered
or
just
shoplifted.
and
looking
to
those
documents
is
something
that
we,
in
fact,
have
approved
in
very
limited
situations
and
those
limited
situations
are
when
the
statute
itself
is
something
called
“divisible,”
when
it
lists
alternative
crimes,
you
know
crime
x
or
crime
y
or
crime
z,
and
you're
trying
to
figure
out
which
crime
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
so
that
you
can
then
compare
that
crime
to
the
elements
of
the
generic
offense.
i
mean
life
is
so
much
fun
here
under
acca.
and
so,
we've
allowed
courts
to
do
this
in
that
limited
context
where
the
statute
lists
crimes
divisibly
and
we're
just
trying
to
figure
out
which
crime
the
defendant
was
actually
convicted
of.
but
in
this
opinion,
what
we
say
is
that
that's
the
only
context
in
which
one
can
use
that
approach.
it's
called
the
“modified
categorical
approach”.
we
say
that
that's
the
only
context
when
a
statute
is
divisible,
but
one
can
use
a
modified
categorical
approach.
otherwise,
our
standard
categorical
approach
is
what
should
work.
and
here
because
this
statute
did
not
list
crimes
divisibly,
instead
the
statute
had
only
a
single
set
of
elements
that
defined
the
relevant
crime
much
more
broadly
than
the
generic
offense,
this
statute
flunks
the
categorical
approach
and
so
the
conviction
cannot
be
use
as
an
act
of
predicate
offense.
we,
basically,
for
reasons
that
are
laid
out
in
the
opinion,
show
that
the
approach
of
the
courts
below,
looking
beyond
the
elements
to
try
to
figure
out
what
the
defendant
actually
did,
would
really
just
implode
the
categorical
approach,
and
for
all
the
reasons
that
we've
given,
the
categorical
approach,
although
it
sometimes
leads
to
very
peculiar
results,
is
kind
of
the
best
way
we
can
think
of
to
make
this
statute
work.
so,
the
decision
below
is
reversed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
