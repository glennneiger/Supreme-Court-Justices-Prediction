justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
that
an
element
of
the
burglary
statute
is
the
violation
of
some
possessory
interest.
now,
i
know
there
is
some
disagreement
between
you
and
the
government
about
that.
but
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
that
is
an
element,
one
way
for
the
california
court
to
express
that
is
to
say
simply,
as
it
has,
that
an
element
is
the
violation
of
the
possessory
interest.
another
way
of
saying
exactly
the
same
thing
would
be
to
say
that
the
term
“
enters
”
under
the
california
burglary
statute
means
either
breaking
into
a
structure
or
the
violation
of
the
possessory
interest
in
some
other
way.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
those
are
exactly
equivalent.
now,
if
they
were
to
say
the
latter,
would
a
conviction
under
this
statute
potentially
qualify
under
the
armed
career
criminal
act?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
they
--
they
set
out
alternative
elements,
either
breaking
into
the
structure
or
the
violation
of
the
possessory
interest
in
some
other
way.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
they
have
said
--
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
saying
a,
an
element
is
the
violation
of
the
possessory
interest,
and
b,
the
elements
are
breaking
or
the
violation
of
the
possessory
interest
in
same
other
way,
are
exactly
the
same
substantively?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
if
the
terms
of
the
statute
set
out
alternative
ways
of
satisfying
an
element,
you
have
alternative
elements
in
essence,
that
then,
even
if
some
of
those
alternatives
don't
fall
within
generic
burglary,
if
one
does,
then
a
conviction
under
that
statute
potentially
can
qualify.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--okay.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
now,
what
if
the
state
supreme
court
says
exactly
the
same
thing?
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
was
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
elements
are
set
out
in
the
statute
or
whether
they
are
defined
by
the
state
court.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i'll
ask
the
question
one
more
time.
is
there
a
difference
--
what
the
california
court
has
said
is
that
an
element
is
the
violation
of
a
possessory
interest.
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
is
correct,
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
california
law,
is
there
any
substantive
difference
between
saying
that
and
saying
the
element
is
breaking
or,
in
the
alternative,
the
violation
of
a
possessory
interest
in
some
other
way?
is
there
some
substantive
difference
between
those
two
things?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
argument
comes
back
to
how
the
elements
are
defined.
it
comes
back
--
so
in
your
view,
what
is
critical
is
in
a
case
of
a
broad
statute
--
whether
the
statute
simply
sets
out
a
broad
category
or
whether
it
sets
out
lots
of
subcategories,
that's
what
your
argument
comes
down
to.
if
the
court
says
--
if
the
california
legislature
or
the
california
court
says,
the
element
is
entry,
period,
that's
one
thing.
if
they
say
the
element
is
breaking
or
entering
in
some
other
way,
that's
something
entirely
different.
it
all
comes
down
to
that,
in
your
view.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
that's
your
argument,
then
you're
really
asking
for
us
to
modify
our
prior
cases.
because
i
thought
it
was
clear,
that
if
the
element
--
if
the
statute
requires
--
that
to
qualify
under
acca,
you
have
to
have
a
gun.
and
the
statute
says
that
you
have
to
have
a
weapon,
and
a
weapon
is
defined
as
a
gun,
a
knife,
or
a
hatchet,
that
would
be
okay.
is
that
wrong?
isn't
that
your
--
don't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
was
not
yes;
it
was
no.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
seems
to
me
perhaps
clearest
about
this
case
and
others
is
that
this
modified
categorical
approach
has
turned
out
to
be
extremely
complicated,
and
occasionally
produces
results
that
seem
to
make
no
sense
whatsoever.
is
this
inevitable?
is
this
really
what
congress
intended,
or
did
the
court
create
this
problem
by
the
way
it
has
interpreted
acca?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
does
the
offense
of
burglary
have
the
element
of
using
force
or
threatening
to
use
of
force?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
element
doesn't
--
the
element
language
doesn't
apply
to
burglary.
