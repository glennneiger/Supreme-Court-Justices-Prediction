mr.
dan
b.
johnson
may
it
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
it
doesn't
matter
what
my
client
was
convicted
of
in
1978
in
the
state
of
california.
what's
important
for
the
armed
career
criminal
act
is
what
he's
convicted
of.
and
as
we
all
know,
when
you're
--
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime,
elements
have
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
agreed
to
by
a
defendant
after
waiving
his
constitutional
rights.
in
california,
burglary
--
unlawful
entry
as
defined
by
the
court
in
taylor
on
what
a
generic
burglary
consists
of,
is
not
an
element
of
california
burglary.
any
entry
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime,
a
theft,
or
a
felony
will
do.
a
california
jury
is
never
required
to
actually
find
unlawful
entry
in
the
taylor
sense.
regardless
of
the
defendant's
conduct,
a
california
burglary
conviction
is
not
by
its
elements
taylor
burglary
for
armed
career
criminal
act.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
i
don't
take
issue
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
state
courts
clearly
state
something
is
an
element
of
a
crime,
i
--
you
know,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
okay.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
because
i
don't
believe
possessory
interest
equates
to
taylor
definition.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
if
--
if
the
elements
are
shown,
and
if
that's
the
definition,
then
yes.
but
i
don't
think
california
possessory
interest
is
the
same
thing.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
i
don't,
your
honor,
because
in
the
taylor
sense
you
have
to
have
an
unlawful
trespass,
actually
a
trespass,
or
an
invasion
of
a
person's
--
well,
unlawful
trespass.
in
california
you
don't
have
to
have
a
trespass.
and
as
the
court
indicated
in
the
taylor
decision,
it
talked
about
shoplifting
in
the
state
of
california.
so
is
a
shoplifter
someone
who
should
be
subject
to
an
armed
career
criminal
act
enhancement?
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
i--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--i
have
no
argument
with
that.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
that's
the
modified
categorical
approach,
i
believe.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
i
--
as
i
said,
if
the
element
is
set
forth
and
it's
an
element
that
meets
the
definition
of
the
generic
definition
in
taylor,
then
i
agree
with
you.
but
i
don't
believe
california
burglary
does
that,
because
the
entry
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime
is
burglary
in
california.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
there
may
not
be
a
substantive
difference,
but
in
california
breaking
is
not
required
at
any
time.
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
because
in
that
case,
the
jury
--
if
a
statute
is
made
where
the
question
is,
is
a
weapon
involved,
and
you
can
commit
that
with
an
ax,
a
gun,
or
a
knife,
but
the
element
is
weapon,
the
jury
is
only
required
to
find
weapon.
and
if
gun
is
--
is
the
fact
that
needs
to
be
shown
for
an
active
predicate,
you
don't
get
there.
again,
you
go
back
to
the
element,
what's
the
person
convicted
of.
they
would
be
convicted
of
a
weapon
violation,
not
a
gun
violation.
and
so,
i
suggest
it's
the
same
thing
here.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
if
the
state's
statute
sets
off
those
as
an
alternative
element,
i
would
agree
with
that.
if
they
are
not
set
out
in
an
alternative
element,
then
i
don't
think
they
are
--
i
think
they
are
a
manner
and
means
of
committing
the
crime.
i
don't
think
they
are
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
i
--
if
it's
spelled
out
as
an
element,
i
think
you
can,
but
if
it's
not
an
element--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--again,
i
think
it
would
go
back
to
the
element
of
--
of
weapon--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--i
think
you
do.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
it's
not
my
burden
to
do
that.
and
i
expected
that
question,
but
i
think
even
under
--
under
the
residual
clause
we
win
the
case.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
because
in
california
a
shoplifter
is
not
--
but
i
would
think--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--well,
there's
--
there's
other
ways
other
than
just
shoplifting.
for
example,
a
mortgage
broker
going
into
a
home
with
an
invitation.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
doesn't
it
come
back
to
the
test
that
this
court
thought
congress
meant
when
you
made
the
ruling
in
taylor
that
we're
not
going
to
look
to
the
manner
and
means
of
commission,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
elements--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--well,
if
the
taylor
definition
--
after
the
court
worked
that
through,
i
think
the
taylor
went
with
the
categorical
elements
approach.
i
think
what
you're
talking,
your
honor,
is
--
is
a
different
approach.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
but
then
why
do
we
have
the
“
is
burglary
”
language
and
the
other
sentences?
don't
they
get
eaten
up
by
that?
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
i
think
in
this
case
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
considerations
that
drives
our
argument
is
that
if
you
get
into
that
factfinding
mode
of
manner
and
means
in
order
to
establish
an
element
that
is
not
in
the
state
statute,
which
is
in
the
case
we're
looking
at
here,
i
think
you
got
an
apprendi
problem,
and
i
think
under
the
sixth
amendment
my
client
should
have
had
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
went
from
a
max
10
to
a
max
of
life
and
a
mandatory
min
of
15
years
based
on
what
we
contend
is
factfinding
in
violation
of
apprendi.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
i
think
the
breaking
under
the
california
statute
is
a
manner
and
means
of
committing
the
crime.
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime,
because
you
don't
have
to--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--do
that.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
that's
kind
of
a
two-part
question.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
the
first
question
is,
because
the
breaking
is
not
part
of
california
requirement,
a
jury's
never
required
to
find
that
as
an
element.
nor
does
a
judge
when
he's
taking
a
plea
have
to
find
that
having
taken
place.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be,
because
i
think
unless
--
unless
there
are
alternatives
in
the
statute,
some
of
which
constitute
the
generic
crime
and
some
of
which
don't,
i
don't
think
you
can
use
a
modified
categorical
approach.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
that's
obviously
a
more--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--exactly
true.
just
like
an
example
would
be
in
a
plea
bargain
context
the
prosecutor
charges
a
person
with
delivery
of
a
controlled
substance,
maybe
there
is
a
problem
with
the
search
or
something
and
they
come
up
with
a
plea
bargain
of
possession
of
a
controlled
substance.
are
we
going
to
30
years
later
go
back
and
say,
well,
the
colloquy
said
this
person
did
do
a
delivery,
so
we
are
going
to
punish
him
as
if
he
did?
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
you
look
to
the
plea
colloquy--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--even
if
you
say
it
does,
it
still
doesn't
--
it's
not
an
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
yes.
in
california
you
--
just
entry
with
intent
is
all
you
need,
with
intent
to
commit.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
it's
not
necessary
and
that's
the
point--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--exactly.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
and
the
manner
and
means
of
--
of
committing
it
isn't
the
point.
it's
what
are
you
convicted
of.
and
again,
i
think
unless
the
court
decides
to
change
that
approach,
i
think
we're
going
to
have
an
apprendi
problem.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
it
may
--
it
may
come
down
to
what
the
court
thinks
california
means
by
invasion
of
a
possessory
interest.
but
again,
i
just
--
i
don't
see
invasion
of
a
possessory
interest
as
the
equivalent
of
taylor
entry.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
that's
correct.
i
think
that
sums
it
up.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
if
the
predicate
element
is
included
in
the
--
in
the
statute
or
the
decision,
i
agree
with
that.
but
again,
i
don't
think
i
have
to--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--maybe
i
misunderstood
the
question.
but
i
think
the--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--the
conviction
is
just
for
entry,
and
for
the
entry
with
intent,
which
again
isn't
how
this
court
defined
burglary
in
taylor.
and
so--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--yes.
yes.
i
agree
with
that.
but
the
government
wants
you
to
use
the
shepard
documents
to
go
beyond
that.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
there's
an
--
there's
an
easy
way
to
fix
that.
a
state
legislature
can
change
their
law
if
they
want
to.
the
congress
can
change
the
approach
they
want
to
take,
and
that
would
solve
that
problem.
but
i
don't
think
it's
up
to
the
court
to
change
22
years
of
jurisprudence
to
do
that.
california
has
known
this
for
over
22
years.
these
problems
have
been
--
have
been
around
and
percolating,
and
the
right
to
a
jury
on
issues
of
fact--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--i
agree.
so
congress
can
amend
the
statute
if
they
wish,
as
many
members
of
the
court
have
talked
to
the
court
and
asked
the
court
to
do.
but
in
light
of
how
i
believe
this
court
interprets
the
law,
and
the
categorical
approach,
and
the
idea
was
that
using
the
modified
categorical
approach
would
only
apply
in
a
narrow
set
of
circumstances,
the
california
--
or
the
ninth
circuit's
version
is
not
a
narrow
set
of
circumstances.
arguably,
it's
just
about
any
crime
that
comes
in
--
later
on,
sometimes
decades
later,
they're
going
to
be
doing
fact-finding
on
issues,
some
of
the
participants
might
have
passed
away.
i
mean,
all
kinds
of
things
like
that.
it's
not
fair
to
the
--
to
a
defendant
under
those
circumstances
that
that
kind
of
fact-finding
is
going
to
take
place
and
result
in
the
egregious
extra
penalties
he's
looking
at
unless
he
has
a
jury
trial.
those
aren't
facts
of
the
conviction.
they
are
facts
about
the
conviction.
i
think
that's
the
difference
between
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
and
what
all
the
other
circuits
have.
i
think
the
other
circuits
get
it.
they
get
the
idea
modified
categorical
should
be
narrow.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
california
burglary
is
--
i
believe,
in
my
reading
of
the
case
law,
it's
--
the
intent
is
formed
as
you
enter
the
premises.
and
that's
when
the
burglary's
been
committed.
if
--
for
example,
that's
the
way
i
read
the
case
law.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
except
the
--
again,
is
it
the
intent
in
the
generic
sense,
or
is
it
the
intent
in
the
california
sense?
and
i
suggest
there's
a
difference,
because
again,
i
don't
believe
--
invading
a
possessory
interest,
i
think
that
came
up
when
someone
was
convicted,
or
they
tried
to
convict
them
of
burglarizing
their
own
home,
and
the
person
had
a
possessory
interest
so
they
said
oh,
you
can't
be
guilty
of
that.
i
just
--
i
don't
think
possessory
interest
equates
to
the
generic
taylor
element.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time,
if
i
might.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
thing
i
would
like
to
point.
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion
about
shoplifting,
as
if
that's
one
of
the
only
problem
areas
we
have.
on
page
9
of
our
reply
memorandum,
footnote
5
contains
a
number
of
examples
of
other
--
california
burglaries.
and
i
--
it's
page
9
of
the
reply
memorandum,
footnote
5.
california
burglary,
it's
--
those
examples
are
just
a
few
examples
how
a
burglary
is
consensual
entry
into
homes.
that
is
not
an
unprivileged
entry,
and
it's
not
a
trespass.
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
limiting
it
to
just
saying
that
shoplifting
is
the
only
problem
we
have,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
i
agree
with
that,
and
i
think
that
--
i
--
i
don't
think
anything
has
changed
in
--
since
--
in
the
last
22
years
for
the
court
to
step
away
from
taylor.
in
fact,
i
think
the
recent
developments
and
constitutional
law
six
memo
rights
to
trials
on
factfinding.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
i
don't
believe
it
does.
i
think
the
theory
is
that--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--i
think
it
does.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
clause.
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
well,
again,
i
think
if
we
get
into
the
residual,
it's
going
to
require
the
evaluations
the
court
have
done
on
that.
but
modified
--
if
you
--
if
you
look--
mr.
dan
b.
johnson
--i
agree
with
that.
unless
there's
other
questions,
i'd
yield
the
rest
of
my
time.
