mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
maybe
at
a
point
in
a
colloquy
that
my
friend
was
having
with
justice
breyer,
which
brought
out
the
point
that
petitioner's
position
here
is
that
there's
a
difference
between
alternative
elements
in
state
crimes
and
alternative
means;
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
guilty
plea,
which
is
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
i
don't
see
how
you're
going
to
make
that
sort
of
distinction.
it's
an
unworkable
distinction,
because,
from
--
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant
pleading
guilty,
whether
it's
an
alternative
element
or
an
alternative
means,
it's
just
an
alternative
way
of
offering
the
factual
basis
for
the
crime.
and
the
sentencing
court
ought
to
look,
as
the
court,
as
this
court
said
in
shepard,
to
the
factual
basis
that's
offered
for
pleading
guilty.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
think
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
--
i
do
think
you've
accurately
described
what
petitioner
--
the
dividing
line
the
petitioner
would
advocate
is.
but
i
would
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
experience
of
the
court
of
appeals
with
trying
to
apply
that
dividing
line,
and
that
will
reveal
to
the
court
very
clearly
why
it
becomes
unworkable.
because
we've
got
several
courts
of
appeals
--
as
the
court's
aware
there's
a
division
of
authority
on
this
--
that
have
said,
well,
look,
we
want
to
look
for
statutes
that
are
phrased
in
the
disjunctive
or
that
have
these
separately
numbered
subsection
headings
or
something.
now,
setting
aside
whether
that's
really
principled
or
not
to
focus
on
the
text
versus
the
judicial
decision,
let's
accept
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
that's
the
line.
the
problem
is
that
then
the
next
case
that
those
courts
confront,
that
applying
that
rule
rigidly
produces
really
strange
results.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
--
the
parties
have
not
briefed
here
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
speculate
on
what
the
court
would--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
this
case
has
been
argued
as
--
because
this
is
a
conviction
under
california
burglary,
it's
been
argued
under
the
--
the
premise
that
it
should
be
classified
as
generic
burglary.
but
let
me
offer--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that
--
that's
--
i
understand
your
honor's
view
on
that,
on
that
subject.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
if
i
can
try
to--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
want
to
be
very
careful
that
we're
talking
about
the
same
thing,
when
we
say
“
missing
element
”.
and
so
maybe
i
can
give
--
give
an
example
of
what
i
think
is
a
missing
element
case
and
one
to
which
we
do
not
think
the
modified
categorical
approach
can
be
applied.
and
a
good
way
to
think
about
the
exercise
that
we
think
a
sentencing
court
should
be
engaged
in
here
is
to
say,
imagine
there's
a
set
of
boxes
on
one
side
that
correspond
to
the
elements
of
the
generic
offense
--
excuse
me
--
of
the
state
offense,
and
then
on
the
other
side
a
set
of
boxes
that
correspond
to
the
elements
of
the
generic
offense.
and
the
exercise
is
to
go
through
the
shepard
materials
and
figure
out
what
goes
into
those
boxes
or
what
went
into
those
boxes
on
the
state
side
to
establish
a
basis
for
the
previous
conviction.
and
then
you
take
whatever
was
put
in
those
boxes,
be
it
specific
or
general
or
whatever
it
is,
and
then
see
if
those
things
give
you
enough
to
fill
in
the
elements
of
the
generic
offense.
now,
in
a
case
that
we
would
call
a
missing
element
case,
let's
take,
for
example,
because
we're
talking
about
burglary,
let's
talk
about
criminal
trespass.
so
criminal
trespass
let's
assume
is
defined
as
the
unlawful
entry
of
a
building
or
structure,
period.
and
there's
no
provision
that
you
have
to
have
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
now,
it
doesn't
matter
what's
in
the
shepard
materials
for
someone
who
pleads
guilty
to
criminal
trespass,
because
there's
no
way
you're
ever
going
to
get
something
in
one
of
those
boxes
about
unlawful
entry
or
structure
that's
going
to
let
you
fill
in
the
generic
box.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
we
would
need
to
know
--
i
guess
i
would
need
to
know
in
your
hypothetical
what
--
what
we're
trying
to
classify
that
conviction
as,
because--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i'm
sorry.
i
guess
my
--
my
--
my
concern
is
--
is
that
i
would
need
to
know
what
generic
enumerated
crime
we're
trying
to
fit
that
into,
because
although
perhaps
that
could
be
classified
under
the
residual
clause--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
that
might
raise
a
--
i
think
that
raises
a
different
set
of
questions.
i
want
to
be
clear
that
our
argument
here
at
this
point
is
only
that
the
court
should
accept
this
for
purposes
of
dealing
with
the
enumerated
--
with
enumerated
offenses.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think
because
the
way
this
court's
clause
jurisprudence
has
evolved,
it
requires
the
court
to
make
some
assessment
of
the
degree
of
risk
of
some
set
of
conduct
that's
not
too
much
more
serious
than
what
the
defendant
engaged
in,
but
not
too
much
less
serious
and
so
i
don't
know
what
that
reference
point
is.
i
mean,
there's
something
of
that,
i
think
in
--
in
--
in
your
honor's
disagreement
with
the
majority
in
the
sykes
case,
i
think
of,
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
right
frame
of
reference
to
draw
is.
so
i
think
residual
clause
cases
are
a
very
difficult
context
in
which
to
--
to
talk
about
hypotheticals
here,
and
for
that
reason,
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
think
it's
more
productive
to
try
to
assign
them
to
burglary
or
one
of
the
other
generic
offenses.
if
i
can
give
an
example--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--if
the
state
statute
provided
that
all
entries
qualified,
which
is
what
i
understand
your
hypothetical
to
be,
then
i
think
that
probably
amounts
to
a
missing
elements
situation,
because
--
and
i'm
taking
the
court's
test
from
shepard
here.
the
question
is
what
did
the
defendant
necessarily
admit
in
the
plea
colloquy.
and
there
may
be
--
i
want
to
be
clear
--
there
may
be
any
number
of
things
that
are
in
the
shepard
materials
that
are
noted
in
the
plea
colloquy,
but
if
they
are
not
offered
as
the
legal
basis
for
the
defendant's
conviction,
then
they
don't
make
it
into
those
boxes
that
i
was
talking
about
and
they
don't
make
it
into
being
a
basis
for
the
generic
offense.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
don't
think
--
no,
i
don't
think
we're
trying
to
add
that.
i
agree
that
if
--
if
--
if,
for
example,
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
in
gauze
had
come
out
the
other
way
and
said,
yep,
it's
your
own
home,
you
know,
so
what.
as
long
as
you're
entering,
the
statute
literally
says
“
entry
”,
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
further
we
need
to
examine,
then
i
agree
this
would
be
--
you
could
call
it
a
missing
element
case.
but
the
problem
with
petitioner's
position
about
california
law
is
that
that's
not
california
law.
petitioner
says
--
i
wrote
this
down,
any
--
he
says:
"any
entry
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime
will
do.
"
that
is
not
true.
you
can
enter
your
own
house
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
that
is
not
burglary
in
california.
you
can
enter
somebody
else's
house
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
crime
and
that's
not
burglary
if
they
know
you
intend
to
do
that.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
we
certainly
agree
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--we
absolutely
agree
that
--
that
the
shoplifting
basis
for
california
burglary
does
not
correspond
to
generic
burglary.
but
by
the
same
token
we
also
agree
that
the
burglary
of
an
automobile
version
of
california
burglary--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
don't
think
we're
back
to
--
i
don't
think
we're
back
to
--
i
don't
think
we're
back
to
any
real
problem
here,
because
the
court
should
not
be
seeking
a
rule
here
that
turns
on
some
idiosyncrasy
of
how
state
law
is
phrased
or
announced.
the
court
should
be
looking--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
draw
any
distinctions
among
those.
i
guess
what
--
what
i'm
saying
is
the
government's
test
is
--
is
that
in
applying
the
modified
categorical
approach
to
a
conviction
entered
upon
a
guilty
plea,
the
court
should
be
looking
at
what
the
--
what
the
legal
basis
for
the
prior
conviction
was,
which
is,
in
the
words
of
shepard,
“
the
matters
”
--
"the
factual
matters
the
defendant
necessarily
admitted.
"
that's
--
that's
what
shepard
says.
and
shepard
--
shepard
draws
an
analogy--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes,
it
is
a
different
result.
but
let
me
explain
why
that
is
--
that's
not
actually
germane
to
the
dispute
that
we're
having
here,
because
the
prosecutor
equally
could
have
said:
he
broke
and
entered
one
of
the
places
enumerated
in
the
statute.
and
that
too
would
have
been
vague
and
that
wouldn't
have
allowed
the
sentencing
court
to
classify
it
as
generic
burglary.
that
--
the
possibility
that
the
shepard
records
are
insufficiently
precise
or
they're
too
opaque
or
that
they
just
don't
exist
because
they've
been
lost
is
something
that
can
frustrate
the
application
of
the
modified
categorical
approach
regardless
of
whether
we
are
talking
about
cars
versus--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--but--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
by
the
same
token,
the
defendant
would
not
care
a
whit
whether
it
really
was
a
grocery
store
or
it
was
a
car,
because
those
two
would
also
cause
him
to
be
convicted
of
the
same,
of
the
same
burglary
offense
under
california.
but
they
would
lead
to
different
results
for
classifying
the
prior
conviction.
the
point--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
guess
i
am
not
prepared
to
make
a
confident
prediction
about
the
relative
number
of
cases.
it
certainly
would
be
more
cases,
but
i
think
that
we
would
be
expanding
it
that
way
in
an
effort
to
assure
greater
sentencing
equity.
it
seems
very
strange
to
me
that
you
could
have
had
someone
engage
in
exactly
the
conduct
the
petitioner
did,
but
in
another
state,
come
into
court,
have
exactly
the
same
guilty
plea
colloquy,
be
convicted
of
that
state's
version
of
burglary,
and
then
it
does
count,
but
it
doesn't
count
in
california.
for
some
reason
--
for
a
reason
that
it
has--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that
--
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
in
part
i'm
not
--
well,
in
part
i'm
not
even
sure
of
that.
if
i
can
return
to
the
experience
of
the
courts
of
appeals
in
this
and
give
some
examples
where
the
courts
of
appeals
that
might
have
preferred
to
stick
to
these
rules
about
looking
for
the
word
“
or
”
in
the
statute
or
looking
for
separately
numbered
subsections
and
then
they
confront
cases
like
the
statutory
rape
example
in
our
brief,
where
the
state
statute
of
conviction
provides
that
the
victim
of
a
statutory
rape
has
to
be
under
the
age
of
18,
but
maybe
the
generic
offense
says
that
the
victim
has
to
be
under
the
age
of
16.
now,
that
element
of
age
isn't
phrased
in
the
disjunctive,
but
it
seems
very
strange
that
if
the
defendant
admits
to
his
victim
being
under
--
age
14,
that
we
wouldn't
recognize
that.
or
you
have
the
situation
in
the
seventh
circuit,
that
just
about
a
year
after
it
decides
the
woods
case
in
which--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
the
question--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
let's
imagine
for
the
moment
that
his
case
had
been
tried
to
a
jury.
now,
the
instructions
might
have
said:
do
you
find
that
the
victim
is
under
the
age
18
--
under
the
age
of
18?
but
let's
for
the
sake
of
argument
say
that
the
instructions
--
the
instructions
provided:
was
the
victim
age
--
do
you
find
that
the
victim
was
age
14?
those
would
be
perfectly
valid
instructions,
and
if
that
was
what
the
jury
found
then
we
would
say
in
the
taylor
sense
that
that
was
what
the
jury
was
actually
required
to
find.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
the
text--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
text
of
the
statute
in
this
part
of
it
does
not
refer
to
elements.
there
is
a
part
that
refers
to
has
as
an
element
the
use
of
force
or
that
sort
of
thing.
but
here
the
relevant
text
of
the
statute
asks
the
court
to
determine
does
the
defendant
have
a
previous
conviction
for
a
crime
that
is
burglary.
here
the
defendant
has
a
previous
conviction
for
breaking
and
entering
a
grocery
store,
that's
the
basis
on
which
he
was
convicted,
and
breaking
and
entering
a
grocery
store
is
generic
burglary.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
the
--
the
defendant's
statement
--
well,
in
the
context
of
this
plea,
it
is
true
that
the
words
didn't
come
out
of
the
defendant's
mouth.
of
course,
at
a
proceeding
like
this
one
can
fairly
understand,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
and
other
circuits
do,
understand
that
those
factual
bases
are
adopted
by
the
court
precisely
because
the
defendant
does
not
say
anything
contrary
to
--
and
of
course--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--because
we
can
treat
--
because
we
can
treat
the
proceeding
in
this
colloquy
as
the
defendant
adopting
that
factual
basis
offered
by
the
prosecutor,
accepted
by
the
court.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
because
your
latin
is
better
than
mine.
but--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
this
is
at
the
most
--
this
is
--
this
of
course
is
at
--
at
one
of
the
most
important
moments
in
the
criminal
process
here.
this
is
essentially
the
defendant
confessing
his
guilt
and
accepting
punishment
from
the
court.
so
it
--
it
seems
that
it's
fair
to
accept
that
when
a
basis
is
offered
for
his
conviction
--
and
he
is
silent--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
at
least
if
it
was
different,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
here's
--
here's
the
relevance
of
it.
it's
because
at
common
law,
of
course,
there
was
a
strict
breaking
requirement,
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
taylor,
and
in
going
back
to
the
lafave
treatise
in
--
in
taylor,
that
requirement
had
over
the
years
and
into
modern
statutes
been
relaxed
to
include
not
only
strict
breakings,
but
also
entries
by
fraud,
entries
by
threat
and
so
forth.
gauze
--
and
the
reasoning
in
gauze
explains
that
the
california
legislature's
codification
of
burglary
simply
does
that
relaxation
a
little
bit
better,
by
adding
essentially
one
more
category
of
gauze
--
taken
with
subsequent
decisions
about
shoplifting
and
such
--
explains
california
just
did
that
one
better
by
adding
another
category,
which
is
entries
that
exceed
the
implied
consent
to
enter
public
places
for
lawful
purposes.
so
what
you're
left
with
here
is,
this
case
exists
at
the
common
law
core
that
both
california
and
generic
burglary
retain,
which
is
an
entry
by
break
--
an
entry
by
breaking.
and
it
is
true
that
both
generic
burglary
is
dispensed
with
that
requirement,
in
the
sense
that
it
allows
other
thing
to
qualify,
and
so,
too,
california
has
dispensed
with
that
requirement,
but
it
hasn't
completely
eliminated
the
relevance
entirely
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
entry.
there's
still
a
question
there.
it's
simply
easier
to
satisfy
it--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
exactly.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
can't--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
can--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well
--
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
i
can
give
you
a
statistical
survey.
the
only
thing
i
can
offer,
and
i
offer
it
with
some
hesitation,
is
my
conversations
with
california
prosecutors
suggest
that
they
are,
at
least
today,
generally
disinclined
to
charge
shoplifting
as
burglary,
because
it's
a
lot
easier,
and
effectively
gets
them
the
same
result
in
those
cases,
to
charge
it
as
larceny.
now--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--but
that's
anecdotal.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
to
charge
it
as
larceny,
because
very
often,
it
will
be
the
completed
shoplifting
is
very
hard
to
prove
they
had
the
intent
when
they
went
into
the
store.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it
does,
but
it
--
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
automobile
burglaries
come
under
this
statute.
the
statute
is
broader
as
to
the
place
burgled,
it's
broader
as
to
the
types
of
unlawfulness
of
entry.
that's
not
a
reason
not
to
recognize
that
when
the
defendant,
as
petitioner
did
here,
says
my
crime
was
breaking
and
entering
--
to
recognize
it
as
breaking
and
entering,
which
is
all
we
think
shepard
asks
for.
and
i
want
to
be
clear
that
you
wouldn't
go
beyond
that.
we're
not
saying
that
a
defendant
who's
pleading
guilty
to
criminal
trespass
who
says
it
was
breaking
and
entering
and
i
intended
to
go
steal
something
in
there,
you
can't
then
call
that
burglary,
because
the
additional
admission
to
intent
is
not
germane
to
the
conviction
for
criminal
trespass.
so
you
can't
use
that
and
turn
that
into
generic
burglary.
that
answers
the
hypothetical
that
was
raised
about
someone
who
enters
a
plea
bargain
to
possession
of
controlled
substances
instead
of
distribution.
that
answers
a
great
many
of
the
parade
of
horribles
that
petitioner
is
offering.
and
that's--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--if
in
your
hypothetical
the
garage
is
a
--
is
not
your
own
garage
and
you
don't
have
the
consent
of
the
garage's
owner
to
--
who
knows
that
you're
going
to
take
the
wrench,
no,
they
are
the
same.
those
are
the
same
thing.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
shoplifting
could
be
charged,
and
someone
could
plead
guilty
to
shoplifting,
and
that
wouldn't
count.
the
problem
here
is
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes,
we
agree.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
absolutely.
you
can
be
convicted
of
shoplifting.
we
don't
disagree
with
that.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
approach
that
taylor
and
shepard
suggests
is
one
that
focuses
on
what
the
defendant
necessarily
admitted
in
offering
the
legal
basis
for
his
conviction
rather
than
on
hypotheticals
about
other
conduct
he
might
have
committed
that
would
have
resulted
in
the
same
conviction.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
if
i
may,
briefly.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
my
sense
--
my
sense
is
that
this
problem
is
largely
the
product
of
lower
courts
trying
to
draw
very
fine
formalized
angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin
distinctions
about
the
statutes,
rather
than
simply
focusing
on
the
conduct
that
was
necessarily
admitted.
and
if
they
would
do
that,
i
actually
think
this
would
go
significantly
more
smoothly.
