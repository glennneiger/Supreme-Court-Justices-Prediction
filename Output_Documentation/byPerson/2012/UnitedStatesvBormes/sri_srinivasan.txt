mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decisions
have
long
established
that
congress
will
be
deemed
to
have
waived
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
only
if
it
unequivocally
expresses
its
intent
to
do
so.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
are
such
statutes,
justice
sotomayor.
of
course--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
they
would
have
two
features
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions
that
have
found
the
tucker
act
to
be
applicable.
one
would
be
that
the
statute
does
not
contain
its
own
remedial
mechanism,
and
the
second
would
be
that
the
substantive
obligations
in
the
statute
run
against
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states
alone.
and
an
example
of
that
type
of
statute
is
the
one
that
this
court
found
to
be
supported
by
the
tucker
act
in
white
mountain
apache
tribe
or
in
mitchell
ii.
those
are
the
kinds
of
statutes
as
to
which
i
think
the
tucker
act
was
meant
to
apply.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
of
course--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
does
when
they're
dealing
with
the
statute
like
this.
and,
of
course,
the
reason
that
we
are
addressing
tucker
act
immunity
is
because
tucker
act
immunity
is
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
in
this
case
according
to
the
reasoning
of
the
federal
circuit.
and
the
problem
with
the
reasoning
of
the
federal
circuit
is
it
allows
the
litigant
to
readily
circumvent
the
court's
strict
test
for
sovereign
immunity
waivers
by
the
straight
forward
device
of
adding
the
tucker
act
as
a
jurisdictional
basis
in
the
complaint.
and
it's
not
at
all
clear
why
a
plaintiff
couldn't
do
that
for
any
claim
under
any
statute,
including
a
statute
as
to
which
this
court
would
have
already
concluded
that
the
unequivocal
expression
test,
the
standard
test
applied
for
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity,
was
not
satisfied.
now,
to
give
the
court
a
concrete
example
of
this,
in
lane
v.
pena,
the
court
concluded
that
for
rehabilitation
act
claims
under
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
there
was
no
unequivocal
expression
of
an
intent
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
by
congress
for
purposes
of
the
damages
claims;
and,
therefore,
a
damages
claim
can't
be
brought
against
the
united
states
under
section
504.
but
under
the
federal
circuit's
approach,
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
a
plaintiff
couldn't
bring
a
damages
claim
against
the
united
states
for
a
violation
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
by
adding
the
tucker
act
to
the
jurisdictional
bases
in
the
complaint.
because
if
the
plaintiff
were
able
to
do
that,
notwithstanding
this
court's
decision
in
lane
v.
pena,
the
result
would
be
that
the
plaintiff
could
say,
the
federal
circuit,
you
should
look
at
the
statute
and
ask
the
question
whether
it
can
be
fairly
interpreted
to
mandate
the
payment
of
money
by
the
government.
there
is
no
unequivocal
expression
of
an
intent
to
waive
sovereign
immunity,
but
that
doesn't
detract
from
the
ability
of
the
federal
circuit
to
conclude
that
the
statute,
nonetheless,
can
be
fairly
interpreted
to
mandate
the
payment
of
money.
now,
of
course,
if
that
issue
were
to
arise,
we
would
make
the
argument
that
the
statute
can't
be
so
read.
but
the
possibility
that
a
plaintiff
could
make
that
argument,
notwithstanding
this
court's
decision
in
lane
v.
pena,
we
think
reinforces
the
need
to
conclude
--
to
conclude
that
the
tucker
act
can't
be
applied
in
the
way
that
the
federal
circuit
sought
to
apply
it
here.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think
one
--
one
way
to
look
at
the
flsa,
if
we're
looking
at
it
in
the
first
instance,
would
be
to
conclude
that
the
flsa
itself
has
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
so
you
wouldn't
look
to
the
tucker
act
as
the
basis
for
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
you
would
look
at
flsa
in
the
way
that
we
think
you
should
look
at
fcra
--
excuse
me,
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
or
fcra.
now,
your
honor
is
correct
that
there
is
a
body
of
court
of
claims
jurisprudence
that
doesn't
necessarily
view
the
statute
in
that
way.
but
if
you
apply
the
framework
that
we
think
is
the
correct
one
to
apply,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
you
might
reach
the
same
conclusion
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
although
under
a
slightly
different
route.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
it
would
depend.
there
is
a
little
bit
of
an
anomaly
in
the
flsa
because
the
flsa
doesn't
necessarily
point
to
any
particular
court
as
the
basis
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
it
says:
"in
any
federal
or
state
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
"
but
this
statute
specifically
allows
for
claims
to
be
brought
in
district
courts
and
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
so
one
way--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
one
way
to
potentially
see
the
difference
--
and
i'm
not
going
to
quibble
with
--
with
what
your
honor's
saying,
but
one
way
to
potentially
see
a
difference
is
because
the
flsa
only
refers
to
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
--
it
doesn't
have
a
free-standing
provision
that
reversed
the
district
courts
--
it's
possible
to
read
that
statute
as
essentially
incorporating
the
tucker
act
as
setting
forth
what
the
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
would
be.
here,
1681(p),
which
is
set
forth
at
13(a)
and
14(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
speaks
specifically
about
actions
being
brought
under
fcra
in
any
appropriate
united
states
district
court,
and
then
only,
it
goes
on
to
talk
about,
or
in
any
other
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
so
that's
a
potential
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure.
i
do,
your
honor.
the
text
of
the
tucker
act,
it's
true,
if
you
read
the
text
to
apply
to
its
full
potential
reach,
then
the
argument
would
be
more
difficult;
but,
the
text
of
the
tucker
act
has
never
been
read
that
way,
including
by
this
court
itself,
starting
with
nichols
v.
united
states--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
guess--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
i
guess
you
--
if
you
read
the
tucker
act
to
its
full
textual
reach,
i
think
we
would
have
a
more
difficult
case.
but
our
argument
is
that
when
the
statute
refers
to
claims
founded
on
any
act
of
congress,
it
was
never
intended
to
apply
literally
to
any
conceivable
act
of
congress.
and,
in
fact,
this
court's
own
test
for
money
mandating
--
the
money
mandating
test
that
applies
to
the
tucker
act
embodies
that
understanding
because--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--we're
appealing--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--we're
certainly
relying
on
that,
justice
scalia,
when
you're
asking
whether
the
tucker
act
can
be
used
as
the
basis
for
waiving
sovereign
immunity
for
claims
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act.
so
when
you
bring
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
into
play,
yes,
we're
absolutely
relying
on
the
specific
versus
the
general
proposition,
as
this
court
has
relied
on
in
any
number
of
cases.
i
guess
i
understood
justice
kagan's
question
to
be
talking
about
the
tucker
act
and
the
tucker
act
alone,
without
bringing
into
play
any
other
statute.
now,
i
take
your
honor's
point
that
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
the
tucker
act
in
that
kind
of
isolated
fashion,
because
usually
you'll
be
asking
a
question
whether
a
claim
can
be
brought
against
the
united
states
under
some
other
statutory
regime.
and
so
if
that
statutory
regime
includes
its
own
remedial
mechanism,
as
fcra
does,
it's
hard
to
avoid
resort
to
the
specific
control
as
a
general
proposition.
but
the
other
point
about
construing
the
text
of
the
tucker
act
alone
is
that
the
tucker
act
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
so
the
canon
that
we
construe
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
strictly
comes
into
play
when
we
construe
the
terms
of
the
tucker
act
itself.
and
i
think
it
stands
to
reason
that
when
you
apply
that
canon,
you
wouldn't
read
the
tucker
act
to
encompass
fully
any
act
of
congress,
because
the
implications
for
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
would
be
quite
substantial.
and
so
the
court
has
never
construed
the
tucker
act
that
way,
and
it
shouldn't
countenance
that
kind
of
construction
now,
which
is
effectively
what
the
federal
circuit's
interpretation
allows,
because,
rather
than
applying
the
strict
standard
under
which
congress
would
have
to
be
seen
to
have
unequivocally
expressed
an
intent
to
waive
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
in
the
terms
of
fcra,
it
allows
a
plaintiff
to
avoid
that
by
simply
resorting
to
the
tucker
act
in
the
jurisdictional
basis
of
a
complaint,
and
getting
the
real
act
by
the
federal
circuit's
own
description
standard
that
applies
to
the
tucker
act.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
guess
a
few
responses,
justice
ginsburg.
first,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
is
subject
to
the
substantive
obligations
in
fcra,
i
don't
know
that's
there's
a
one
size
fits
all
answer.
i
think
you'd
have
to
go
provision
by
provision
and
make
an
assessment.
and
the
reason
i
would
say
that
is
that,
with
respect
to
certain
provisions
at
least,
there
are
other
statutes
that,
depending
on
the
provision,
have
a
specific
obligation
against
the
government.
and
i'm
thinking
in
particular
of
the
debt
collection
improvements
act,
the
privacy
act
in
certain
contexts.
as
so
you
have
--
you
have
to
ask
the
question
whether,
with
respect
to
the
particular
fcra
provision
that's
alleged
to
run
against
the
united
states,
would
the
better
basis
for
finding
the
united
states'
obligations
be
some
other
statute
that
speaks
more
specifically
to
the
question.
so
i'm
resisting
the
notion
that
fcra's
references
to
person
in
all
of
its
substantive
obligations
would
necessarily
encompass
the
government.
now,
there's
at
least
one
provision
as
to
which
we
don't
deny
that
the
government
is
covered,
and
that's
1681b(b),
and
that
provision
is
set
forth
at
pages
--
at
page
7a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
and
with
respect
to
the
particular
provision
at
issue
in
this
case,
the
truncation
provision,
i
guess
we
don't
have
to
confront
the
question
of
whether
the
government
is
bound
by
that
provision.
it
might
well
be,
but
we
don't
have
to
confront
that
question,
because
the
government
acts
as
if
it's
in
compliance
with
that
provision
because
it
has
to.
there's
a
series
of
network
agreements
that
the
government
has
entered
into
with
credit
card
companies
that
allow
the
government
to
participate
in
the
credit
card
system.
as
a
condition--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--1681b(b).
if
you
look
at--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i'm
sorry.
it
starts
at
4a.
and
the
--
4a,
permissible
purposes
of
government
reports;
the
conditions
for
furnishing.
and
then
if
you
go
to
7a
--
that's
also
part
of
b(b)
--
b(b)4
has
an
exception
for
national
security
investigations.
and
it
talks
at
b(b)(4)(a)
about
"in
the
case
of
an
agency
or
department
of
the
united
states
government
which
seeks
to
obtain
and
use.
"
and
because
there's
a
reference
to
the
united
states
government
in
that
provision--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
stands
to
reason
that
the
term
“
person
”
in
b(b)
--
which
starts
at
4a;
excuse
me
--
encompass
the
united
states
government.
i
guess
the
short
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
is
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
one
size
fits
all
answer.
but
the
other
part
of
your
question
is,
are
we
taking
the
position
that
even
if
substantive
obligations
run
against
the
united
states,
there
still
wouldn't
be
a
remedy,
at
least
a
remedy
in
damages
against
the
united
states?
and
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
but
that's
not
at
all
atypical
under
this
court's
sovereign
immunity
jurisprudence,
and
it's
not
at
all
atypical
for
congress
to
have
fashioned
a
scheme
that
runs
in
that
way.
and
the
privacy
act
at
least
is
one
example,
where
in
the
privacy
act,
which
applies
to
the
government
and
the
government
alone,
there
are
certain
obligations
that
the
government
has
to
comply
with
in
that
statute.
but
congress
is
very
careful
to
cabin
the
circumstances
in
which
the
government
would
be
subject
to
liability
and
money
damages.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think,
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
a
distinction
that
ultimately
doesn't
make
a
difference
in
the
context
of
this
case.
in
the
prior
cases
in
which
this
court
has
applied
the
specific
over
the
general
canon
in
related
contexts,
it's
true
that
the
statutes
in
some
situations
contemplated
liability
against
the
united
states,
but
it
had
--
that
statute
would
have
certain
limitations.
and
i'm
thinking,
for
example,
of
hinck,
of
erika,
of
brown
v.
general
services
administration,
cases
like
that,
and
sheehan.
and
what
the
court
said
was,
where
a
statute
provides
for
liability
against
the
united
states,
but
in
certain
situations,
you
don't
look
to
a
different
statute,
the
tucker
act,
to
circumvent
those
kinds
of
limitations.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
guess
--
i
don't
think
we
need
to
have
that
negative
implication
to
that
full
extent
in
order
to
invoke
the
specific
versus
the
general
canon,
because
the
question
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
what
did
congress
intend?
and
where
congress
enacts
a
specific
remedial
scheme
that
sets
out
the
extent
to
which
liability
will
be
imposed
under,
in
this
case,
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
it
stands
to
reason
that
congress
would
have
expected
courts
to
look
to
the
remedial
scheme
that
it
established
to
determine
to
metes
and
bounds
of
liability,
not
to
some
other
general
default
provision.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
therefore
in
that
sense,
the
specific
remedial
scheme
that's
in
the
statute
should
control
over
some
other
general
scheme
that
congress
might
well
not
have
had
in
mind
at
all
when
it
set
forward
the
terms
under
which
claims
can
be
brought
under
fcra.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
if
the
statute
were
that
general?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
i
would,
because
i
think
in
that
context,
congress
would
have
made
a
determination
on
the
scope
of
liability
for
claims
under
that
statute.
it
would
have
given
thought
to
that
issue,
and
it
would
have
set
forth
in
a
very
general
provision
the
metes
and
bounds
of
the
liability.
and
congress
i
think
in
that
instance
wouldn't
have
expected
anyone
to
look
to
the
tucker
act,
because
congress
gave
no
indication
that
it
was
thinking
about
the
tucker
act.
now,
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
if
you
had
a
statute
that
spoke
in
those
kinds
of
general
terms,
of
course,
we'd
have
i
think
a
very
good
argument
that
there
would
have
been
no
contemplation
of
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
so
we
would
strongly
resist
the
notion
that
the
united
states
might
fall
within
the
compass
of
that
general
provision.
but
on
the
question
of
whether
you'd
look
to
that
general
provision
as
opposed
to
the
tucker
act,
i
think
you
would
look
to
that
general
provision,
because
congress
in
the
context
of
enacting
that
statute
told
everybody:
we're
defining
the
extent
to
which
liability
can
be
asserted
in
court
by
reference
to
this
general
provision;
this
is
where
you
ought
to
look,
not
somewhere
else.
now,
one
other--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
does.
i
think
it
does.
and
i
think
that's
quite
a
breathtaking
proposition,
and
not
one
that
congress
would
have
intended
by
virtue
of
the
tucker
act--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
it
would
be
hard
to
square
that
understanding
with
the
way
--
with
the
series
of
this
court's
cases
that
apply
the
specific
versus
general
canon,
because
i
think
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
in
brown
v.
general
services
administration,
in
erika,
in
hinck,
that
if
you
thought
that
the
subject--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
--
well,
you
can
look
at
it
that
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
guess
my
only
response--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that's
the
question
because
it
depends
on--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
depends
on
how
you
construe
the
tucker
act.
i
mean,
i
think
your
honor
is
correctly
construing
the
tucker
act's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
only
to
apply
to
a
certain
limited
subset
of
acts
of
congress.
and
if
you
construed
it
in
a
sufficiently
limited
way,
i
suppose
we
could
live
with
that
result.
but
i
think
the
better
way
to
approach
the
question
is
to
look
at
the
particular
remedial
scheme
that
congress
enacted
in
the
scope
of
the
statute
itself.
and
for
purposes
of
questions
of
sovereign
immunity,
you'd
look
to
that
particular
remedial
scheme
and
ask
the
age-old
question,
countenanced
by
this
court's
decisions,
of
whether
there
is
an
unequivocal
expression
of
an
intent
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
the
scope
of
that
statute
itself.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
--
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--not
claims
in
contract,
for
example.
obviously,
if
there
is
an
expressed
contract
with
the
united
states,
i
don't
know
that
that
comes
under
a
statute,
necessarily,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
just
compensation
clause.
that
doesn't
come
under
a
statute,
it
comes
under
the
constitution,
but
the
tucker
act
can
be
used.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
if
that
statute
--
at
least
if
that
statute
has
its
own
remedial
scheme,
then
you'd
look
to
the
remedial
scheme
in
that
statute.
but
i
think
this
is
where
i
started
off
with
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
and
i
think
there
is.
i
think
the
--
statutes
like
the
one
that
this
court
had
before
it
in
white
mountain
apache
tribe
are
one.
another
example
that
i
could
give
the
court
is
there
is
a
statute
that
dealt
with
payment
of
compensation
to
prisoners
of
war.
this
was
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
in
bell
v.
the
united
states.
i
think
it's
cited
in
footnote
42
of
the
court's
opinion
in
bowen
v.
massachusetts.
but
that
statute
specifically
set
forth
that
compensation
would
be
owed
to
prisoners
of
war
held
in
captivity.
that
statute
did
not
have
its
own
remedial
scheme.
its
substantive
obligation
ran
against
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states
alone,
by
nature.
and
the
tucker
act,
i
think,
in
that
context
would
step
in
to
supply
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
and
the
reason
is
that
that
statute
has
the
two
predicate
conditions
that
we
think
have
to
be
met
in
order
to
even
raise
the
question
whether
the
tucker
act
steps
in.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
i'd
qualify
it
in
one
respect,
which
is
that
if
the
statute
contains
its
own
remedial
scheme,
that's
an
independent
reason
for
not
looking
at
the
tucker
act.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that's
right.
i
think
you
would
look
to
the
question
of
whether
there
has
been
a
sufficiently
expressed
waiver
in
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself,
which
is
the
traditional
test
that
this
court
has
applied.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes,
it
would.
i
think
it's
easier
where
you
have
a
remedial
scheme,
obviously,
but
i
think
it's
also
the
case
that
where
the
substantive
obligation
is
a
generally
applicable
one
and
doesn't
run
against
the
united
states
alone,
you'd
still,
i
think,
want
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
true.
i
mean,
but
i
guess
--
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
tucker
act
applies
or
the
statute
doesn't
have
its
own
remedial
scheme,
obviously,
in
this
case,
because
fcra
does
have
its
own
remedial
scheme.
our
argument
would
still
apply.
and
on
the
question
of
whether
we're
reading
the
tucker
act
in
one
particular
way
to
a
subsets
of
acts
of
congress,
i
guess
one
point
i'd
make
is
that
the
money
mandating
test
that
this
court
has
always
applied
where
the
tucker
act
does
apply
already
presupposes
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
just
any
act
of
congress,
because
the
act
of
congress
has
to
be
a
money-mandating
one.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
the
last
sentence,
the
last
thought
at
least
--
maybe
i
should
try
to
rephrase
it,
but
the
last
thought
is
that
this
court's
jurisprudence
already
presupposes
that
the
tucker
act
doesn't
apply
to
every
act
of
congress
because
the
court's
jurisprudence
requires
that
the
act
of
congress
be
money
mandated.
so
we
are
already
in
a
zone
in
which
the
tucker
act's
reference
to
acts
of
congress
doesn't
literally
extend
to
every
conceivable
act
of
congress.
it
only
extends
to
certain
acts
of
congress.
and
i--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--if
you
didn't
have
--
that's
--
that's
--
i
guess
--
if
you
didn't
have
the
remedial
scheme.
we
don't
get
to
that
question,
justice
kennedy,
because
you
only
get
to
the
money-mandating
question
if
there
is
not
the
remedial
scheme
in
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
and
the
substantive
obligation
runs
against
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states
alone,
which
this
one
doesn't
because
it's
generally
applicable.
and
it's
hard
to
conceive
of
that
question
in
the
abstract
because
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
is
money
mandating
in
that
it
specifically
contemplates
the
payment
of
money
by
the
united
states;
and,
precisely
because
the
statute
is
generally
applicable,
i
think
we
would
say
that
under
this
statute
it's
not
money
mandating,
because
it's
not
money
mandating
in
that
it
doesn't
contemplate
payment
by
the
united
states
with
relevant
specificity
because
the
substantive
obligation
is
generally
applicable.
you
only
get
to
that
question
in
a
context
like
white
mountain
apache
tribe
or
mitchell
ii,
where
the
substantive
obligation
runs
against
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states
alone,
and
where
there
is
no
remedial
scheme
embedded
within
the
statute
itself.
and
then
you
ask
the
question
whether
is
that
kind
of
substantive
obligation
that
runs
against
the
united
states,
is
that
one
that's
naturally
conceived
as
a
money
mandating.
and
on
that,
i
think
you
would
look
at
a
couple
of
considerations
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions.
one
is,
is
the
obligation
one
that
necessarily
deals
with
compensation?
so,
for
example,
the
statute
i
was
referring
to
earlier
that
has
to
do
with
compensation
for
imprisoned
prisoners
of
war,
that
one
naturally
has
to
do
with
compensation,
so
it
might
be
money
mandating.
in
white
mountain
apache
tribe
and
the
other
trust
cases
that
arise
under
the
indian
tucker
act,
the
court
concluded
that
because
background
principles
of
trust
law
would
necessarily
contemplate
the
payment
of
money,
that
those
statutes
are
money
mandating.
but
the
principal
point
here--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--is
you
only
get
to
that
question
if
you
get
past
that
hurdle.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
right,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
i
think
the
money-mandating
test,
justice
sotomayor,
is
whether
it
contemplates
the
payment
of
damages
by
the
united
states.
and
i
guess
that's
why
i'm
having
a
hard
time
addressing
that
question
in
the
abstract,
because
there
is
a
predicate
condition
that
hasn't
been
satisfied.
that
question
only
naturally
arises
where
the
substantive
obligation
runs
against
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
alone.
i
think
precisely
for
the
reason
that
your
honor
says,
where
the
substantive
obligation
is
generally
applicable
in
that
it
applies
to
parties
beyond
the
united
states,
it's
hard
to
ask
the
question
whether
the
statute
is
money
mandating
in
the
relevant
sense.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that
--
i
will
grant--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
will
grant
you,
justice
sotomayor,
that
that
hypo
is
more
difficult
than
this
case
because,
although
i
would
construe
that
to
be
generally
applicable,
it
does
talk
about
the
government.
it
specifically
references
the
government,
and
i
think,
by
your
honor's
hypothetical,
the
united
states
alone.
it's
not
an
undifferentiated
reference
to
persons,
which
is
what
you
have
in
fcra.
i
still
think
i
would
call
that
generally
applicable
such
that
the
tucker
act
wouldn't
come
into
play,
but
i
don't
deny
that
it
would
be
a
closer
case
than
what
you
have
here.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
that
situation,
and
i
think
that's
why
you
look
to
this
remedial
provision
that
congress
enacted
to
determine
the
metes
and
bounds.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
the
privacy
act
has
its
own
remedial
mechanism
within
it
typically.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
or
you
don't
proceed
at
all,
yeah.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
flsa
is
a
bit
complicated,
for
the
reasons
i
was
adverting
to
earlier.
it's
--
this
court
has
never
confronted
the
question
of
how
exactly
you
go
forward
under
the
flsa.
and
i
think,
because
of
the
ambiguity
in
the
courts
to
which
the
flsa
refers,
for
the
reasons
i
was
discussing
with
justice
sotomayor
earlier,
i
think
you
could
see
that
statute
as
incorporating
the
tucker
act
itself,
but
that
would
be
something
that
congress
did.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
u(i).
i
think
there's
several
answers
to
u(i).
first
of
all,
i'm
not
sure
which
way
that
cuts
because
the
fact
--
it
may
be
u(l),
it
may
be
u(i),
but
you
--
i'm
not
sure
which
way
that
cuts
because,
on
one
hand,
the
fact
that
congress
specifically
provided
for
the
united
states
to
be
liable
in
certain
situations
i
think
cuts
in
favor
of
our
understanding,
not
against
it.
but
there's
a
more
fundamental
point
about
the
argument
that
my
friend
makes
on
the
other
side,
which
is
that
that
statute
was
enacted,
i
think,
before
the
civil
remedies
provisions
were
expanded
to
encompass
all
persons.
so
it's
hard
to
conclude
that
that
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
would
have
referred
to
something
that
came
along
later.
now,
i
have
two
points
that
i'd
like
to
make
in
rebuttal,
one
of
which,
there's
been
some
questions
today
about
which
is
the
specific
statute
and
which
is
the
general
statute.
now,
one,
i
think,
clear
indication
that
the
specific
statute
for
present
purposes
should
be
fcra
is
to
look
at
what
the
plaintiffs
allege.
the
plaintiffs
are
bringing
a
fcra
claim,
and
there's
no
mistake
about
that,
because
the
plaintiffs
seek
the
fcra
advantage
of
statutory
damages
of
at
least
$100.
and
so
they're
grounding
their
claim
in
the
fcra
cause
of
action.
and
i
think,
therefore,
you
should
look
at
fcra
to
determine
whether
the
government
is
liable.
and
you
don't
have
a
situation
in
which
you
can
mix
and
match
under
both;
you
should
look
to
fcra
to
determine
whether
there's
been
a
clear
and
express
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
other
point
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
something
that
--
references
something
justice
breyer
was
adverting
to
earlier,
which
is
even
if
there
was
some
universe
in
which
you
could
contemplate
a
hybridization
where
you
apply
the
tucker
act,
even
though
there's
a
cause
of
action
already
in
the
statute,
you
wouldn't
do
so
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
there
are
clear
indications
that
congress
wouldn't
have
contemplated
a
resort
to
the
tucker
act.
the
tucker
act
doesn't
apply
to
torts.
this
claim
is
a
tort
claim.
we
know
this
because
the
court
in
safeco
a
few
terms
ago
--
this
is
at
551
u.s.
69
--
specifically
referred
to
the
restatement
of
torts
as
a
means
of
interpreting
the
term
willfulness,
which
is
the
linchpin
for
the
claim
here.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
