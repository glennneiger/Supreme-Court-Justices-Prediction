justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
you
are
appealing
to
the
textual
principle
that
the
specific
governs
the
general.
isn't
that
what's
going
on
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
the
tucker
act
is
a
more
general
provision,
and
you
are
saying
it's
--
it's
overcome
by
a
more
specific
provision
that
provides
for
compensation
but
excludes
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
1681b(b)(b),
you
said?
where
is
that
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
7a.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
still
in
all,
your
argument
is
--
is
not
just
a
straightforward
specific
governs
the
general
argument.
i
mean,
that
be
would
the
case
if
the
other
statute
which
the
plaintiff
is
trying
to
run
around
through
the
tucker
act
specifically
--
it
clearly
prohibits
suit
against
the
government.
then
you
would
say,
you
know,
the
specific
governs
the
general
even
though
the
govern
--
the
tucker
act
permits
it;
the
statute
prohibits
it.
but
you're
saying
this
other
statute
here
does
not
really
prohibit
it.
you're
just
saying
this
other
statute
does
not
permit
it
under
our
usual
rules
about
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
being
strictly
construed.
so,
you
know,
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
difference
--
it's
an
odd
sort
of
a
specific
governs
the
general
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that's
--
that's
because
the
negative
implication
of
that
statute
is
--
affirms
that
there
is
no
liability
of
the
united
states.
okay?
but
here,
you
don't
have
--
you
don't
have
that
negative
implication
at
all,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
really
--
doesn't
the
question
come
down
to
as
you're
putting
it
whether
--
whether
the
tucker
act
eliminates
for
all
other
statutes
the
presumption
against
liability
on
the
part
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
you
would
lose,
not
win.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
--
we
have
known
existed.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
is
covered
by
the
tucker
act?
i
mean,
every
--
every
basis
for
suit
against
the
government,
every
claim
that
the
government
owes
you
money
rests
upon
some
statutory
text,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
express
contracts
with
the
united
states.
anything
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but
anything
that
comes
under
a
statute,
you
would
look
to
the
other
statute
to
see
whether
there
is
sovereign
immunity
under
that
statute;
and,
if
there
is
under
that
statute,
then
the
tucker
act
does
not
overcome
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
say
it
again.
i
lost
it.
give
me
the
last
sentence
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
need
the
tucker
act
now,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
sue
under
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
are
you
splitting
your
claim?
i
mean,
if
you
have
both
a
cause
of
action
under
fcra
and
under
the
tucker
act,
the
one
has
to
go
to
the
federal
circuit
and
the
other
elsewhere,
or
the
court
of
claims
and
then
the
federal
circuit?
what
do
you
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
also
claimed
under
fcra,
under
the
statute,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
other
statutes
offhand
--
i
can't
think
of
any,
but
maybe
you
know
some
--
in
which
you
can
get
money
out
of
the
united
states
but
don't
have
to
go
through
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
the
federal
circuit?
what
other
statutes
are
there?
and
if
there
are
none,
the
reason
i
ask
the
question,
it
becomes
less
and
less
plausible
that
fcra
was
meant
to
allow
suit
against
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
money
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
same
reason
that
you
have
the
principle
of
sovereign
immunity.
they're
--
they
are
perfectly
willing
to
subject
corporations
to
immense
liability,
but
they
are
not
willing
to
subject
the
federal
government
to
immense
liability.
that's
what
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
is
all
about,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
really
have
--
i
haven't
followed
this
argument.
you
say
(l)--
justice
antonin
scalia
--shows
that
they
had
liability
by
the
government
in
mind?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
why
anybody
--
notwithstanding
any
other
provision,
the
remedies
and
sanctions
set
forth
in
this
section
shall
be
the
only
judicial
remedies
and
sanctions
for
violation
of
this
section.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
that
bear
upon
whether
the
united
states
is
liable
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
are
right
about
that,
i
guess
we
could
write
a
very
narrow
opinion
saying
the
tucker
act
applies
where
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
the
original
statute
anyway,
in
which
case
we
would
not
have
made
much
new
law,
would
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
doesn't
concede
that
you
have
a
cause
of
action
under
fcra
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
say
--
they
say
just
the
opposite.
and
so
what
i
find
peculiar
is
that
there
should
be
two
causes
of
action
for
the
same
thing.
you
can
proceed
either
under
fcra
or
under
the
tucker
act
or
both.
i
mean,
that's
very
strange
to
me.
it
seems
to
me,
one
or
the
other,
and
it
would
normally
be
the
specific
governing
the
general.
so
if
you
say
there
is
one
under
fcra,
why
do
we
need
the
tucker
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
other
case
where
--
where
you
--
somebody's
been
allowed
to
proceed
under
the
tucker
act
where
there
is
clear
ability
to
proceed
under
some
other
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
srinivasan,
i
hate
to
eat
up
any
of
your
time,
but
do
you
acknowledge
that
there
are
other
statutes
under
which
a
person
can
proceed,
either
under
the
statute
or
under
the
tucker
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
privacy
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you'd
say
you
either
proceed
under
the
privacy
act
and
you're
covered
there,
or
you
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
what
about
--
what
is
it?
fsla
was
the
other
one?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
u(l),
that
your
friend
raised?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
respondent,
james
bormes,
is
an
attorney
who
filed
a
putative
class
action
against
the
united
states
in
district
court,
seeking
damages
under
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
of
fcra.
bormes
alleged
that
he
paid
a
$350
federal
court
filing
fee
for
a
client
using
his
own
credit
card
on
pay.gov,
the
email
thing,
which
is
an
interest-based
system
used
by
federal
courts
to
process
online
payments.
according
to
bormes,
his
pay.gov
electronic
receipt
included
the
last
four
digits
of
his
credit
card
in
addition
to
its
expiration
date,
which
he
says
is
in
willful
violation
of
fcra.
fcra
provides
among
other
things
that
receipt
can
have
“no
more
than
the
last
five
digits
of
the
card
number
or
the
expiration
date.”
bormes
sought
damages
under
the
act
which
imposes
civil
liability
on
“any
person
who
willfully
fails
to
comply
with
its
requirements
and
defines
any
person
to
include
any
government
or
governmental
subdivision
or
agency.”
fcra
contains
its
own
jurisdictional
provision.
section
1681(p)
of
title
15
authorizes
suit
to
enforce
liability
“in
any
united
states
district
court
without
regard
to
the
amount
of
controversy
or
in
any
other
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.”
bormes
asserted
jurisdiction
under
this
provision,
as
well
as
under
the
little
tucker
act,
28
u.s.c
section
1346(a)(2),
which
grants
district
court's
original
jurisdiction
concurrent
with
the
court
of
federal
claims
of
“any
civil
action
or
claim
against
the
united
states
not
exceeding
$10,000
in
amount
founded
upon
any
act
of
congress.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
holding
that
fcra
does
not
contain
the
explicit
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
necessary
to
permit
damages
action
against
the
united
states.
but
the
federal
circuit
vacated
the
district
court's
decision
without
deciding
whether
fcra
itself
contained
the
necessary
immunity
waiver.
the
court
held
that
little
tucker
act
provided
the
government's
consent
to
suit
for
violation
of
fcra
because
fcra
“can
fairly
be
interpreted
as
mandating
compensation
by
the
federal
government
for
the
damage
sustained.”
we
granted
certiorari
and
today
vacate
the
federal
court's
--
the
federal
circuit's
judgment.
the
little
tucker
act
is
one
statute
that
provides
the
federal
government's
consent
to
suit
for
certain
money
damages
claims
premised
on
other
sources
of
law.
the
tucker
act's
jurisdictional
grant
and
the
company
immunity
waiver
supplies
the
missing
ingredient
for
an
action
against
the
united
states
for
the
breach
of
monetary
obligations
that
would
not
otherwise
be
enforceable
in
court.
but
a
detailed
remedial
scheme
supercedes
the
gap-filling
role
and
general
terms
of
the
--
of
the
tucker
act.
fcra's
provision
set
out
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
liability
and
defines
the
appropriate
form
for
judicial
enforcement,
whereas
in
fcra,
a
statute
contains
its
own
self-executing
remedial
scheme.
we
look
only
to
that
statute
to
determine
whether
congress
intended
to
subject
the
united
states
to
damages
liability.
we
do
not
decide
today
whether
fcra
itself
waives
the
federal
government's
immunity
to
damages
actions.
that
is
a
question
to
be
considered
on
remand,
but
whether
or
not
fcra
contains
the
necessary
waiver,
any
attempt
to
append
a
tucker
act
remedy
to
the
statute's
existing
remedial
scheme
interferes
with
the
scope
of
liability
congress
intended
under
the
statute.
the
federal
circuit
was
therefore
wrong
to
conclude
that
the
tucker
act
justified
applying
a
more
relaxed
sovereign
immunity
analysis
to
fcra
than
our
cases
required.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion
which
--
which
would
include
transfer
of
the
case
to
the
appropriate
federal
court
other
than
the
federal
circuit.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous.
