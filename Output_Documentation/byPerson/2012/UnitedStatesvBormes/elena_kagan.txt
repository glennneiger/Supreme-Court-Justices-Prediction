justice
elena
kagan
mr.
srinivasan,
what
you
say
has
a
good
deal
to
recommend
it,
and
it's
basically,
you
know,
why
should
we
read
the
tucker
act
to
reverse
everything
that
we
know
about
sovereign
immunity,
but
it's
really
hard
to
get
that
from
the
text
of
this
--
the
tucker
act.
in
fact
--
i
mean,
i
guess
my
question
is:
do
you
have
any
textual
argument
for
the
result
that
you
are
asking
us
to
reach?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
not
really
a
textual
argument.
that's
an
argument
about
how
we've
sensibly
limited
the
reach
of
the
tucker
act.
but
the
tucker
act
does
seem
to
include
what
your
friend
there
says
it
includes--
justice
elena
kagan
--against
any
statute.
not
any
statute
except
the
ones
with
remedial
provisions,
but
just
any
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
srinivasan--
justice
elena
kagan
--how
specific
does
the
other
statute
have
to
be?
suppose
there
were
another
statute
that
just
said
any
party
can
bring
suits
to
enforce
any
rights
against
any
persons
under
this
statute.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
if
that's
all
the
statute
says.
it
just
says
any
party
can
bring
suit
to
enforce
rights
under
this
statute.
so
there
is
nor
a
lot
of
hoopla
and
a
lot
of
detail
about
a
remedial
scheme.
would
you
still
say
that
this
controls
over
the
tucker
act?
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
if
a
statute
has
no
remedial
provision
at
all;
it
just
lists
a
set
of
legal
obligations,
but
it
is
a
generally
applicable
statute,
it
doesn't
concern
only
the
united
states?
would
your
argument
still
apply
that
the
tucker
act
has
no
force?
justice
elena
kagan
so
then
your
argument
really
isn't
about
another
statute
having
a
remedial
scheme.
in
the
briefs,
you
present
it
as
another
statute
has
a
remedial
scheme,
of
course
you
should
look
to
that
more
particular
remedial
scheme.
but
you
would
take
the
argument
and
say,
even
if
the
other
statute
doesn't
have
a
remedial
scheme,
we
don't
look
to
the
tucker
act;
we
just
think
of
the
tucker
act
as
having
a
limitation
that
is
not
in
the
tucker
act's
test
--
text
in
order
to
make
the
tucker
act
consistent
with
everything
we
thought
we
knew
about
principles
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
jacobs--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
--
the
import
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
if
your
interpretation
governed,
we
would
be
facing,
really,
a
quite
massive
change
in
the
law
of
sovereign
immunity
as
we've
known
it
until
this
time.
so
i
will
give
you
an
--
congress
decides
to
pass
a
statute,
and
the
statute
has
a
cause
of
action
in
it.
and
the
drafters
say
to
each
other,
do
we
have
to
say
that
the
government
retains
sovereign
immunity?
and
everybody
says,
no,
the
rules
are
that
if
we
say
nothing
at
all,
the
government
does
retain
sovereign
immunity.
now,
under
your
world,
the
next
time
congress
passes
such
a
statute
and
that
question
comes
up,
you
would
say,
oh,
we
have
to
say
that
the
government
waives
--
retains
its
sovereign
immunity,
because
if
we
don't
say
that,
somebody's
going
to
bring
an
action
under
the
tucker
act.
so
for
every
statute,
both
the
ones
that
have
been
written
under
the
old
rules
and
the
new
ones
to
come,
we
have
completely
flipped
the
presumption.
now,
congress
is
going
to
have
to
say
when
it
wants
to
retain
sovereign
immunity,
and
if
it
doesn't
--
if
it
doesn't,
the
tucker
act
applies,
and
you
get
to
be
in
court.
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
think
that
quite
answers
the
question.
that's
a
--
that's
a
question
about
what
fcra
means
and
whether
under
any
standard,
whether
the
fairly
arguable
standard
or
the
express
standard,
you
should
win.
and
that's
a
different
question.
the
question
is
what
standard
are
we
going
to
hold
you
to.
are
we
going
to
say,
all
you
need
to
show
is
that
it's
fairly
arguable,
or
are
we
going
to
say,
no,
unless
there's
an
express
statement
that
the
government
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity,
the
government
retains
it?
and
as
to
that,
you're
asking
us
to
flip
the
presumption
from
now
on.
justice
elena
kagan
but
mr.
jacobs,
you
are
trying
to
evade
a
certain
kind
of
limitation.
the
limitation
that
you
are
trying
to
evade
is
the
rule
that
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
have
to
be
expressed.
and
that's
the
rule
you
are
trying
to
evade
by
going
under
the
tucker
act.
justice
elena
kagan
but
then
you
wouldn't
need
to
go
under
the
tucker
act.
the
difference
between
going
under
the
tucker
act
and
going
under
the
statute
is
the
difference
between,
you
know,
what
--
what
standard
is
a
court
going
to
hold
you
to,
to
decide
whether
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
