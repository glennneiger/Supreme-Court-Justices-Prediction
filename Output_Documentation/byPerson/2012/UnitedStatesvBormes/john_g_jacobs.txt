mr.
john
g.
jacobs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
begin
with
justice
kennedy's
question:
is
this
a
money-mandating
statute?
section
1681(a)
defines
“
persons
”
and
it
defines
“
persons
”
as,
inter
alia,
"any
government
or
government
body
or
agency.
"
that,
it
would
seem
to
me,
would
be
extraordinarily
clear
that
the
government
is
subject
to
this
act
and
subject
to
money
mandating.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
we--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--we
could.
we
believe
we
should
be
able
to
recover
simply
under
fcra
itself,
yes,
your
honor.
but
if
there
were
any
question
as
to
whether
the
government
is
in
fact
covered,
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
answered
by
1681b(b)(4).
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
your
honor,
that
was
--
that
was
the
subject
of
some
debate
in
the
court
below.
we
took
the
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit
because
the
claim
was
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
the
tucker
act.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
we
don't
particularly
care,
your
honor,
but
we
believe
that
we
are
required
by
the
statute
to
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit
if
the
claim
is
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
the
tucker
act.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
i
--
i
--
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
right.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
and
in
1681b(b)(4),
the
statute
said--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
i
mean,
1681p
says
you
can
sue
either
in
district
court
or
any
other
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
and
in
that
regard,
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
remedial
scheme,
and
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
this
is
--
this
is
not
some
reticulated,
remedial
scheme
where
you
have
to
file
a
claim
and
have
a
hearing
and
those
kinds
of
things
where
this
court
has
enforced
that
against
people.
here,
it's
just
a
typical
statute
that
says
you
have
to
do
a,
b,
and
c,
and
if
you
don't
you
can
be
sued
in
federal
court.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
the
privacy
act,
your
honor,
allows
you
to
sue
the
government
in
the
district
court.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
the
case
is
about
printing
the
expiration
date,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
yes.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
it
is
like
it,
but
i
believe
this
court's
jurisprudence
has
been
for
a
long
while
now,
at
least
since
jacobs
and
i
would
submit
even
earlier,
dooley
onward,
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
--
if
you're
suing
under
a
statute
of
the
united
states
or
a
contract
or
anything
else,
if
there's
any
element
of
tort
in
it,
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
there's
no
doubt
intended,
your
honor
posed
a
very
difficult
question.
i
would
submit
that
if
the
statute
says
that
you
may
not
do
a,
b,
and
c,
that
you
could
then
sue
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
yes.
even
though
traditionally,
you
could
think
of
that
as
a
tort,
i
believe
that's
this
court's
jurisprudence.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
i
think
daly
--
dooley,
i
think,
your
honor,
in
1901
said:
"regardless
of
whether
the
exactions
of
taxes
were
tortious
or
not,
we
think
this
case
is
within
one
of
the
first
class
of
cases
specified
in
the
tucker
act
of
claims
based
upon
a
law
of
congress.
"
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
your
honor,
i
believe,
again,
that
this
court
has
not
interpreted
the
cases
that
way.
there
is
a
debate
as
to
whether
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
is
a
tort
or
something
else,
and
yet
this
court
in
white
mountain
and
other
cases
has
not
found
that
to
be
a
bar.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
that's
what
the
government
says,
but
it
is
also
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
and
that
is
often
regarded
as
a
tort,
your
honor.
16--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
your
honor,
i
would
submit
yes,
there
is
no
explicit
--
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
no
explicit
knowledge
in
the
congressional
record
to
whether
this
was
going
to
impact
the
government
or
not.
however,
what
they
talked
about
was
the
almost
epidemic
proportion
of
identity
theft
going
on,
and
in
response
to
that
this
bill
was
passed.
knowing
that
the
government
is
one
of
the
largest
issuers
of
credit
card
receipts,
one
would
have
to
wonder
why
they
would
want
to
exclude
the
government
in
terms
of
protecting
the
public.
that
would
not
make
sense.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
the
credit--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
but
that's
why
i
said
in
terms
of
protecting
the
public,
you
wouldn't
want
to
exclude
such
a
large
--
such
a
large
thing.
and
when
they
wanted
to
protect
the
government,
as
they
did
in
1681b(b)(4),
when
they
wanted
to
exclude
them,
they
explicitly
did
so--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--the
next
year.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
with
respect,
justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
that's
true
at
all.
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
define
person
to
include
the
government.
and
that's
significant
in
this
respect,
your
honor.
we
cite
the
moore
case,
moore
v.
the
department
of
agriculture,
an
almost
identically
worded
statute,
where
it
said,
a
government--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
say
this
applies.
it's
not
some
general
statute
that
says
if
a
credit
card
is
printed
improperly.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
well,
when
they
amended
fcra
in
1996
to
add
the
--
to
change
the
word
from
credit
reporting
agency
to
person,
i
would
submit
that
had
to
be
a
conscious
step.
and
proof
of
that
is
found,
i
think,
in
two
subsequent
amendments.
one,
the
next
year,
1681b(b)(4),
saying,
but
this
does
not
apply
to
the
government
if
there
is
a
national
security
issue.
and
then
the
government
pointed
to
1681u(i),
that
talked
about
if
the
fbi
improperly
disclosed
information,
what
liability
it
would
have.
now,
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
it
stops
there.
but
in
the
government's
petition
for
cert
at
page
78a,
it
also
has
1681u(l)
which
says
any
other
provision
of
this
section
notwithstanding,
people
are
limited
to
this
remedy
against
the
government.
why
would
congress
say
that
if
there
were
not
other
liability
for
congress
--
for
the
united
states.
so,
i
believe
the
--
congress
was
about
as
clear
as
it
could
be
that
it
knew
this
applied
to
the
united
states,
and
when
it
wanted
to
carve
something
out,
it
did
so,
twice.
now--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--(l).
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--this
u
only
applies
to
united
states,
the
fbi.
1681u
is
explicitly
passed
with
regard
to
the
fbi
getting
information
and
improperly
disclosing
it.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
and
this
would
say,
notwithstanding
any
other
provisions,
and
it
wouldn't
do
that
if
there
weren't
other
provisions
applicable.
and
that,
your
honor,
takes
me
back
to
the
moore
case,
which
we
discussed
many
times
in
our
brief,
a
similarly,
almost
identical
statute,
the
equal
credit
opportunity
act.
the
truth
in
lending
act,
the
equal
opportunity
--
the
equal
credit
opportunity
act
and
fcra
were
all
part
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
different
parts
of
it.
and
the
equal
credit
opportunity
act
had
the
same,
almost
the
same
definition
with
one
word
difference
of
importance.
and
then
the
--
the
fifth
circuit
said,
there
is
no
exception
in
here,
once
it
says
that,
for
any
person
--
it
doesn't
have
an
exception
for
the
united
states,
unlike
the
truth
in
lending
act
which
had
a
specific
provision
exempting
the
united
states.
this
is
identical
except
for
one
word
different.
this
says
any,
the
most
emphatic
word
it
could
use.
the
other
two
statutes
say,
a
government
or
government
entity.
this
statute
says,
any
government
or
government
entity.
and
the
united
states
makes
no
response
to
that
interpretation
that
is
throughout
our
judicial
system.
and,
indeed,
it
would
be
difficult
to
because
throughout
the
united
states
now,
the
--
the
united
states
no
longer
even
attempts
to
argue
that
ecoa
does
not
provide
for
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
well,
i'm
hoping
we
won't
make
much
new
law,
your
honor--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--because
i
believe
this
is
consistent
with
this
court's
longstanding
jurisprudence.
and,
indeed,
the
--
the
cases
where
the
court
says,
no,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
bring
this
under
the
tucker
act,
is
where
the
party
is
trying
to
escape,
to
get
around
a
limitation
in
the
substantive
act,
where
they're
trying
to
avoid
a
statute
of
limitations,
avoid
the
requirement
to
file
a
--
a
claim,
as
in
elkhorn
mining,
as
--
to
get
around
--
get
away
from
a
court
as
in
hinck,
where
it
says
the
tax
court
will
have
jurisdiction
of
this.
and
then
they
are
trying
to
get
around--
that's
not
going
on
here.
we're
--
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
not
trying
to
evade
any
congressional
intent
or
statutory
provision
of
fcra.
and
the
government
points
to
nothing
--
no
violence
that
would
be
done
to
the
fcra
by
allowing
this.
the
--
the
reason
that
this
statute
was
passed
was
to
protect
consumers.
the
congress
was
clear
that
if
any
government
violates
the
statute,
it
has
this
liability.
i
do
not
know
how
you
could
have
a
clearer
money-mandating
statute.
and,
justice
scalia,
you
asked,
well,
would
we
just
win
under
the
--
under
the
statute?
my
answer
to
that
would
be
unequivocally
yes,
we
should.
it's
an
unequivocal
waiver.
and
that's
the
irony
here.
i
think
you
have
a
--
a
more
unequivocal
waiver
in
this
statute
than
you
do
almost
any
other
where
the
court
has
found
that
yeah,
that's
a
fair
inference
of
a
money-mandating
situation.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
no.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
2
years.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
2
years
or
6
years
--
2
years
from
discovery,
5
years--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--they
--
they
are
different,
your
honor,
but,
with
respect,
i
see
nothing
about
saying,
this
is
what
you
must
do,
and
if
you
don't
do,
this
is
what
you
have
to
pay
--
i
see
nothing
unusual
about
saying
that
can
be
in
the
court
of
claims;
that
that's
a
tucker
act
claim.
that
doesn't
seem
--
that's
not
some
reticulated
statute
unlike
the
civil
service
review
act
or
something
like
that,
where
you
have
to
do
all
these
steps,
have
this
hearing
first,
have
that
hearing--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--yes.
and
that's--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
yes.
and
i
think
that
is
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
well,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
i
--
i
don't
believe
i
agree
with
the
premise.
this
court
has
consistently
said,
as
your
honor
said,
that
the
tucker
act
only
provides
an
outer
limit
for
filing,
but
we'll
use
the
shorter
time
period.
in
ruckelshaus
v.
monsanto,
the
court
said:
no,
no,
no,
you've
got
--
because
monsanto
didn't
want
there
to
be
a
tucker
act
claim.
it
wanted
to
be
able
to
argue:
we
have
no
relief
available
to
us
for
having
to
disclose
the
components
of
our
insecticides.
and
they
wanted
to
argue:
there
is
no
relief
available
to
us.
and
this
court
said:
no,
you've
got
a
--
you've
got
a
tucker
act
claim.
you
do
have
relief
available
to
you.
and
the
court
said:
yes,
you
didn't
file
a
claim.
there
is
a
procedure
where
you
could
file
a
claim
saying:
this
is
a
trade
secret,
and
the
--
you
then
would
have
arbitration.
and
the
court
said:
you
haven't
done
that;
go
ahead
and
do
that
and
then
let's
see
what
happens.
but
you've
got
a
tucker
act
claim.
and
incidentally,
in
that
regard,
in
ruckelshaus
v.
monsanto,
the
court
discussed
extensively
the
restatement
of
torts
as
to
whether
a
trade
secret
--
a
listed
trade
secret
under
the
restatement
of
torts,
and
then
went
ahead
and
said:
no.
you've
got
a
tucker
act
claim
here.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
absolutely.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
i'm
telling
your
honor
that
we
win
under
such
a
test.
we
don't
believe
such
a
test
is
called
for,
but
if
--
if
such
a
test
were
used,
we
still
win
because
you
do
have
such
a
clear
waiver.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
that
would
be
a
substantial
change
in
this
court's
jurisprudence.
congress
passed
the
tucker
act,
and
this
court,
for
years
now,
has
said,
"if
you
meet
these
requirements,
you
may
sue
under
the
tucker
act.
"
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
no.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
your
honor,
the
tucker
act,
as
made
available
by
congress,
could
we
proceed
only
under
fcra?
yes,
we
could,
but
the
tucker
act
is
available,
the
statute
1295
says
what
it
says,
and
we
have
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
but
there
is--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--your
honor,
i
cannot
name
you
a
case
off
the
top
of
my
head.
as
i
said,
i
believe
the
privacy
act
allows
you
to
do
either.
the
--
all--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
yes.
the
fsla
--
i
was
going
to
tell
you,
as
your
honor
said
earlier.
but
the
cases
where
a
tucker
act
remedy
has
been
denied,
as
i've
said,
are
where
a
person
was
trying
to
evade
a
limitation
of
the
substantive
act.
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
is
four-square
within
the
court's
jurisprudence.
the
government
argues
now
for
a
new
--
and
it's
not
clear
to
me
exactly
what
test,
but
it's
a
limiting
one.
it
would
--
it
would
cut
back
the
tucker
act.
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
no,
your
honor.
we
believe,
and
we've
maintained
throughout,
that
we
do
have
an
express
waiver,
1681(a)--
mr.
john
g.
jacobs
--the
standard,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
is
that
the
tucker
act
is
always
available
unless
a
--
the
substantive
statute
provides
a
limitation
on
that
ability;
either
saying
it
shall
be
--
shall
be
litigated
in
the
tax
court,
it
can
only
be
litigated
if
it
is
preceded
by
a
claim,
an
administrative
claim,
some
limitation
like
that.
if
--
if
there's
something
that
says
it
has
to
be
in
another
forum,
then
you
would
be
evading
it.
