justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
do
you
care?
i
mean,
you're
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
you
bring
a
case
under
this
act.
i
guess
you
lost
because
you
wanted
to
appeal.
and
so
--
so
what
is
the
big
deal?
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit.
who
cares.
why
do
you
care
which
circuit
you
go
to?
you
said
you
think
--
well,
why
do
you
care?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
you
and
the
government
could
have
stipulated,
we
agree
it
goes
to
the
seventh
circuit,
and
nobody
would
have
opposed
you
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case
is
about
you
want
to
go
to
--
you
want
to
go
the
federal
circuit,
they
want
you
to
go
to
the
seventh
circuit?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
in
tort.
this
seems
an
awful
lot
like
a
tort,
or
tell
me
why
it
isn't.
i
mean,
what
you
are
saying
is
there's
a
statute
that
says
you
can't
print
more
than
the
last
five
digits
of
a
card
or
the
date,
the
expiration
date,
and
they
did
both
and
you
want
to
say
“
or
”
means
one
or
the
other,
it
doesn't
mean
and/or.
that's
what
the
case
is
about
fundamentally,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
can
you
do
and/or
or
or.
all
right,
got
it.
now,
if
you
print
--
in
your
view
of
it,
they
printed
too
much
about
a
person's
credit
card.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sounds
like
an
--
sort
of
like
an
invasion
of
privacy,
which
is
normally
a
tort.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
mean?
you
can
sue
for
--
in
other
words,
if
the
statute
were
to
say,
if
smith,
a
government
employee,
assaults
a
person,
he
gets
damages.
federal
statute.
now
he
brings
a
claim
--
i
don't
know
this
law;
i'm
asking,
i'm
not
arguing.
the
plaintiff
sues
the
united
states
for
assault.
and
you're
saying
that
they
can
bring
that
in
the
court
of
claims
because
it's
a
statute.
i
don't
know
how
this
law
works.
i
just
read
that
and
i
know
the
language
doesn't
totally
tell
you.
it's
about
liquid,
illiquid.
i
didn't
get
that
part
exactly.
but
as
i've
understood
it,
you
can't
bring
a
tort
suit
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
that's
what
i
would
like
you
to
elaborate,
because
this
sounds
rather
like
a
tort
suit,
not
sort
of.
that's
why
i
am
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
it
says
you
may
not
assault
someone.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
case
i
should
look
at
to
show
that
is
what?
that's
all
right
if
you
don't
have
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
the
--
a
lot
of
these
provisions
are
technical,
like
the
one
i
think
is
fairly
technical,
the
one
you
are
talking
about,
the
government
--
it
provides
for
treble
damages
--
treble
damages,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
minimum
damage,
punitive
damages,
a
fairly
lengthy
statute
of
limitations
compared
to
the
court
of
claims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
2
years.
and
they
have
6
in
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
--
my
impression
was
there
are
several
differences.
and
normally,
these
things
you,
at
least
arguably,
are
not
appropriate
against
the
government,
because
the
government
when
it
knows
the
law
will
follow
it,
we
hope.
and,
therefore,
you
don't
need
brow-beating
mechanisms
to
make
sure
they
follow
it
once
it's
clarified.
so,
therefore,
it
--
i
mean,
i
can
imagine
arguments.
at
the
same
time,
there
are
differences
between
the
relief
scheme
in
this
statute
and
the
normal
one
you
have
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
they're
arguing
that
that
means
that
they
didn't
want
this
tucker
act
and
these
other
things
to
apply.
i
just
want
to
know
what
your
reply
is
to
that.
they
are
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
is
--
are
you
also
saying,
fcra,
the
underlying
statute,
clearly
waives
sovereign
immunity,
so
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
whether
the
standard
is
a
weak
standard
or
a
tough
standard,
doesn't
matter.
we
win
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you
want
us
to
say
is,
okay.
we
will
apply
the
tough
standard.
there's
still
--
there's
still
--
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
in
fcra.
and
since
sovereign
immunity
is
clearly
waived
there,
then
you
can
bring
this
under
the
tucker
act,
and
the
only
differences
are
the
remedial
schemes
are
slightly
different,
but
that
doesn't
matter.
am
i
correctly
stating
what
you
are
now
telling
us?
