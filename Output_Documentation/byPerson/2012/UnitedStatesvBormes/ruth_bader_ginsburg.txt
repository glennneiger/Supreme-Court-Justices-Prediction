mr.
srinivasan
--
i'm
sorry.
justice

the
united
states
is
governed
by
the
substance
of
the
credit
reporting
act.
the
act
applies
to
the
government,
but
your
point
is
that
there's
no
sanction
for
noncompliance,
even
though
the
united
states,
a
government
system,
is
supposed
to
conform
to
the
standards
in
the
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
jacobs--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--whether
you
think
congress
ever
honed
in
on
the
issue
whether
the
united
states,
given
the
multitude
of
financial
transactions
in
which
it
engages,
ever
thought
that
sovereign
immunity
would
be
waived?
i
mean,
if
you're
right
about
this,
the
consequences
are
enormous
for
the
federal
fisc.
and
we
--
the
statute
developed
in
a
peculiar
way.
first,
there
was
the
definition
of
person
when
there
was
no
civil
liability,
and
then
some
years
later
the
prohibition
of
having
both
the
credit
card
number
and
the
expiration
date.
in
all
of
it,
is
there
any
hint
that
congress
envisioned
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
fair
credit
reporting
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
the
definition
of
persons
was
put
into
the
statute,
there
was
no
civil
liability;
isn't
that
right?
so
they
didn't
--
they
could
not
have
been
thinking
about
civil
liability.
