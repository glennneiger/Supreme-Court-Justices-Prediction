justice

under
your
view,
is
there
any
situation
today
where
the
tucker
act
would
be
applied
to
a
statute?
because
if
we
start
with
the
statute,
which
always
seems
to
be
where
you're
pointing
us
to,
and
we're
only
looking
for
a
clear
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
then
there
will
never
be
another
tucker
act
action
in
the
future.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
they
look
like
to
be
able
to
get
around
our
clear
statement
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
basically
--
i'm
not
sure
why
we're
even
addressing
the
issue
of
tucker
act
jurisdiction.
we
should
have
really
just
been
briefing
the
issue
of
whether
the
statute
at
issue
here
waives
sovereign
immunity--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
that
becomes,
to
you,
the
operative
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
was
going
to
ask
--
following
up
on
my
question--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--many
courts
have
held
that
the
flsa
has
an
express
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
and
many
of
them
have
recognized,
if
not
all,
a
tucker
act
remedy.
under
your
new
approach,
that
holding
is
incorrect,
i
presume--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
the
flsa
has
its
own
remedial
scheme?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
then
the
federal
circuit
has
no
jurisdiction
over
those
claims,
according
to
you,
because
the
waiver
is
in
the
flsa,
it
has
its
own
judicial
remedy.
they
are
not
authorized,
then,
to
go
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
has
the
same
language
as
here,
in
--
you
can
bring
your
suit
in
any
federal
or
state
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
see
the
difference
between--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
exactly
what
i
started
with.
that's
what
i
started
with:
is
there
anything
left
to
the
tucker
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
new
rule
is
if
a
statute
is
written
to
impose
obligations
only
on
the
government,
then
the
tucker
act
is
implicated
immediately.
if
the
rule
says
the
government
and
any
party
who
contracts
with
it
--
a
medicaid
provider
--
must
do
x,
y,
and
z,
and
the
government
and
the
medicaid
provider
have
the
burdens
of
accomplishing
y,
unless
there
is
an
express
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
tucker
act
doesn't
come
into
play.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
your
position.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
are
not
going
to
suggest
that
if
the
scheme
i
just
described
says
x,
y,
and
z,
have
to
do
all
these
things,
and
someone
to
whom
they
owe
that
obligation
can
sue
the
medicaid
provider,
for
example,
for
breach
of
that
obligation,
presumably
--
i'm
putting
in
a
lot
of
hypotheticals
given
our
case
law
--
but
you're
saying
they
can't
sue
the
government
under
the
tucker
act--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--unless
there
is
an
express
waiver.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
this
sort
of
begs
the
question--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
statute
awards
damages
for
breach
of
the
obligation,
so
it's
money
mandating.
the
issue
is
not
whether
it's
money
mandating;
the
question
is
who
is
it
mandating.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
is
not
an
issue
of
whether
it
contemplates
the
payment
of
damages.
it
expressly
awards--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
--
it
is
--
there
is
some
difficulty
with
your
argument,
which
is,
going
back
to
my
simplified
hypothetical,
government
and
medicaid
--
x
providers
have
to
do
x,
y,
and
z;
if
those
persons,
being
defined
as
government
and
providers,
doesn't
do
what
they
have
to
do,
they
have
to
pay
these
damages.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
that's
pretty
clear.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
happy
with
the
circuit's
suggestion
that
the
specific
does
govern
the
general
insofar
as
it
will
adopt
whatever
fcra's
limitations
are?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
into
its
own
processes?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
position
is
that's
perfectly
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
tucker
act
was
to
provide
a
remedy,
where
none
existed,
to
get
rid
of
the
private
bills.
what's
wrong
with
the
government's
basic
proposition
which
is
where
you
have
a
remedy
you
have
to
pursue
that
remedy.
and
i
think
that,
at
bottom,
that's
their
argument.
what's
wrong
with
that
scheme?
instead
of
permitting
two
remedies
with
potentially
conflicting
commands,
whether
it's
on
the
amount
of
damages
or
the
nature
of
the
recovery
or
the
statute
of
limitations,
why
isn't
their
vision
of
what
the
tucker
act
--
the
role
the
tucker
act
should
play
one
that
should
be
given
voice?
one
that
should
be
followed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
fsla
as
well.
