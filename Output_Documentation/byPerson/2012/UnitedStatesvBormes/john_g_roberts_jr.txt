chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
case
11-192,
united
states
v.
bormes.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
it's
really
the
specific
governing
the
general,
but
the
other
way
around,
right?
the
tucker
act
discusses
specifically
the
liability
and
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states,
and
if
the
statute
just
generally
doesn't
address
it
then
the
tucker
act
is
the
specific
one
and
the
other
statute
is
the
general
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you'd
win
under
this
argument,
too,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
win
under
this
argument,
too.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
quite
right
to
say
that
fcra
--
fcra
does
not
specifically
address
the
liability
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
tucker
act
does.
so
the
tucker
act
is
the
one
that's
specific,
and
it
applies
instead
of
the
general
language
in
the
--
in
fcra.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
jacobs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
before
you
get--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
if
you
--
their
argument
is
if
you
go
to
the
seventh
circuit,
you
don't
get
any
money,
right?
because
if
you're
getting
money
from
the
united
states,
don't
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims
in
a
case
like
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
argument
--
your
answer
is
a
little
more
complicated,
because
the
statute
doesn't
say
tort
claims,
it
says
claims
sounding
in
tort,
which
means
cases
that
aren't
torts,
but
are
like
torts.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
case
you
--
you
--
you
have
here
is
like
tort,
an
invasion
of
privacy
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
friend
says
that
that's
a
fiduciary
--
that's
a
trust
breach,
which
has
been
regarded
as
different
than
a
tort.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
it
does
seem
--
i
mean,
justice
breyer's
point.
it
does
seem
a
little
ad
hoc.
in
other
words,
they
don't
fit
quite
together,
and
your
answer
is:
well,
we'll
just
take
whatever,
you
know,
whatever
we
have
to,
to
make
it
fit.
it
would
go
under
the
least
imposing
on
the
government.
it
suggests
that
congress
did
not
expect
the
tucker
act
to
apply
if
you've
got
to
change
the
remedial
provisions
in
fcra
to
get
it
to
fit
under
the
tucker
act.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
srinivasan,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
our
first
case
this
term,
no.
11-192,
united
states
versus
bormes.
