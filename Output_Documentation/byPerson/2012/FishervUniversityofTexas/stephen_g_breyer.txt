justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
are
going
to
the
merits,
i
want
to
know
whether
you
want
us
to
--
or
are
asking
us
to
overrule
grutter.
grutter
said
it
would
be
good
law
for
at
least
25
years,
and
i
know
that
time
flies,
but
i
think
only
nine
of
those
years
have
passed.
and
so,
are
you?
and,
if
so,
why
overrule
a
case
into
which
so
much
thought
and
effort
went
and
so
many
people
across
the
country
have
depended
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
question
is
whether
--
your
point
is,
does
your
case
satisfy
grutter?
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
do
you
want
to
argue
it
right
now
in
the
next
ten
minutes?
i'm
interested
because
i
have
a
very
short
time
to
get
my
question
out,
and
i
need
to
know
how
you
are
going
to
argue
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
it
might,
but
i
want
to
get
to
the
question,
see
what
i'm
trying
to
pinpoint,
because
we
have
such
a
limited
time.
and
to
me,
the
one
thing
i
want
to
pinpoint,
since
you're
arguing
on
that
this
satisfies
grutter
if
properly
understood,
as
you
say
that.
in
looking
up,
we
have
a
two-court
rule.
and
two
courts
have
found,
it
seems
to
me.
that
here
there
is
a
certain
--
there
is
no
quota.
it
is
individualized.
it
is
time
limited.
it
was
adopted
after
the
consideration
of
race-neutral
means.
each
applicant
receives
individual
consideration,
and
race
did
not
become
the
predominant
factor.
so
i
take
those
as
a
given.
and
then
i
want
to
know
what
precisely
it
is
that
grutter
required
in
your
opinion
that
makes
this
different
from
grutter,
in
that
it
was
not
satisfied
here?
the
ones
i
listed
two
courts
say
are
the
same.
so
maybe
there's
some
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
have
a
rule
that
if
two
courts
say
it,
we're
very
reluctant,
on
something
connected
with
facts,
to
overturn
it.
so
--
so
that's
why
i
mention
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
test
is
--
the
test
is,
in
your
opinion
--
i
have
to
write
this
in
the
opinion,
you
say
--
the
proper
test
of
critical
mass
is
is
the
minority
isolated,
unable
to
speak
out.
that's
the
test.
and
it
wasn't
in
grutter
or
was
in
grutter?
and
in
your
opinion,
it
was
in
grutter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isolated.
all
right.
and
the
reason
it
was
satisfied
there
and
not
here
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
they
could
--
this
is
what
is
underlying
my
thing
here.
i
want
to
get
you
directly
to
answer
it.
i
did
look
up
the
figures.
and
before
hopwood
and
the
10
percent
plan,
it
looked
on
the
african
american
side
that
it
averaged
about
5
--
5
percent
per
year,
really,
pretty
steadily.
then
after
hopwood
and
10
percent,
it
went
down
a
little
bit,
not
a
lot,
but
it
went
down
to
about
3
and
a
half
percent,
4
percent,
maybe.
and
then
they
introduced
grutter,
and
it's
back
up
to
5
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
is
that
a
lot?
is
that
a
little?
there
are
several
thousand
admissions
officers
in
the
united
states,
several
thousand
universities,
and
what
is
it
we're
going
to
say
here
that
wasn't
already
said
in
grutter
that
isn't
going
to
take
hundreds
or
thousands
of
these
people
and
have
federal
judges
dictating
the
policy
of
admission
of
all
these
universities?
you
see
why
i'm
looking
for
some
certainty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
saw
what
happened,
you
saw
the
numbers.
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can
answer
it
later
if
you
want,
or
not
answer
it
at
all
if
you
don't.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
uh-huh.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
to
get
--
if
this
is
easy,
do
it;
if
not,
don't.
i
wanted
to
use
accurate
numbers,
and
so
i
discovered
--
i
wanted
to
find
out
how
many
universities
actually
used
a
grutter-type
process
last
year
or
the
year
before,
etcetera.
and
one
of
your
amici,
the
admissions
officers,
according
to
our
library,
is
the
only
place
that
has
that
information,
though
it's
public,
and
i
didn't
want
them
to
do
it
because
they
are
an
amici
of
yours.
and
you
are
both
here,
both
sides,
so
if
you
can
agree
on
--
simply,
roughly
--
what
that
number
is,
i
would
like
to
know
it;
otherwise,
i
will
--
i
can
use
pre-grutter
numbers
which
are
public
and
available.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
sir.
but
it
is
the
correct
answer
to
justice
alito's
--
if
there
are
ever
two
applicants
where
the
gpa,
the
test
--
the
grades,
the
sa1,
sa2,
leadership,
activities,
awards,
work
experience,
community
service,
family's
economic
status,
school's
socioeconomic
status,
family's
responsibility,
single-parent
home,
languages
other
than
english
spoken
at
home,
and
sat
score
relative
to
school's
average
race,
if
you
have
a
situation
where
those
--
all
those
things
were
absolutely
identical,
than
the
person
would
be
admitted
on
the
bounds
of
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you
want
me
to
do
is
go
read
back
what
we
wrote
in
grutter,
go
look
what
the
underlying
determinations
of
critical
mass
were
there,
go
look
exactly
how
it
is
being
done
in
texas
--
which
i
have
charts
that
help
me
see
that
--
and
i
will
find
enough
of
a
difference
that
i
can
write
some
words
that
can
be
administered
by
2,000
or
3,000
--
a
thousand
federal
judges
as
they
try
to
deal
with
programs
like
this,
in
--
that's
the
point,
is
that
right?
