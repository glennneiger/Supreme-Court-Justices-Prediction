chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
get
to
say
that
this
is
case
number
11-345,
fisher
against
the
university
of
texas
at
austin.
and
you
get
to
say--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry.
now
i'm
confused.
i
thought
the
15
percent
figure
was
the
one
that
was
arrived
at
with
the
10
percent
plan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
afford
you
rebuttal
time
since
our
questions
have
prevented
you
from
reserving
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
before
--
i
need
to
figure
out
exactly
what
these
numbers
mean.
should
someone
who
is
one-quarter
hispanic
check
the
hispanic
box
or
some
different
box?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
a
person
who
is
one-quarter
percent
hispanic,
his
own
determination,
would
be
i'm
one-quarter
percent
hispanic.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
would
check
that
box.
what
about
one-eighth?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
it
violate
the
honor
code
for
someone
who
is
one-eighth
hispanic
and
says,
i
identify
as
hispanic,
to
check
the
hispanic
box?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
check
in
any
way
the
racial
identification?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
do
you
know
you
have
15
percent
african
american
--
hispanic
or
15
percent
minority?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
the
same
way.
what
is
that
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
are
student
lists
in
each
classroom
that
have
race
identified
with
the
students.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
you
go
back
to
what
they
checked
on
the
form.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
yes
or
no
question.
you
go
back
to
what
they
checked
on
their
application
form
in
deciding
whether
economics
201
has
a
sufficient
number
of
african
americans
or
hispanics?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
that
number?
what
is
the
critical
mass
of
african
americans
and
hispanics
at
the
university
that
you
are
working
toward?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
are
we
supposed
to
tell
whether
this
plan
is
narrowly
tailored
to
that
goal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
understand
my
job
under
our
precedents
to
determine
if
your
use
of
race
is
narrowly
tailored
to
a
compelling
interest.
the
compelling
interest
you
identify
is
attaining
a
critical
mass
of
minority
students
at
the
university
of
texas,
but
you
won't
tell
me
what
the
critical
mass
is.
how
am
i
supposed
to
do
the
job
that
our
precedents
say
i
should
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
what
you
say,
but
when
will
we
know
that
you've
reached
a
critical
mass?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
grutter
said
there
has
to
be
a
logical
end
point
to
your
use
of
race.
what
is
the
logical
end
point?
when
will
i
know
that
you've
reached
a
critical
mass?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
what,
you
conduct
a
survey
and
ask
students
if
they
feel
racially
isolated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
the
basis
for
our
constitutional
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
what
are
the
others?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
what
level
will
it
satisfy
the
critical
mass?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
at
what
level
will
it
satisfy
the
requirement
of
critical
mass?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
--
how
am
i
supposed
to
decide
whether
you
have
an
environment
within
particular
minorities
who
don't
feel
isolated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
i
see
--
when
you
tell
me,
that's
good
enough.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
don't
--
they
don't
monitor,
but
race
is
the
only
one
of
your
holistic
factors
that
appears
on
the
cover
of
every
application,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
the
question
was
whether
race
is
the
only
one
of
your
holistic
factors
that
appears
on
the
cover
of
every
application.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
give
you
a
little
more
time
since
i'm
going
to
give
your
friend
a
little
more
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
be
clear,
are
you
arguing
that
she
doesn't
have
standing
in
an
article
iii
sense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
address
that
in
your
brief
in
one
footnote,
right?
we
have
an
obligation
to
consider
it
in
every
case,
and
what
you
gave
us
is
one
footnote
in
which
you
said
it's
hard
to
see
how
she
could
establish
cognizable
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
our
jacksonville
case
that
said
it
is
an
injury
to
be
forced
to
be
part
of
a
process
in
which
there
is
race-conscious
evaluation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
friend
--
your
friend
told
us
that
these
remedial
issues
and
damages
issues
had
been
segregated
out
of
the
process
and
are
still
available
for
remand.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
function
more
subtly
in
every
case.
we
have
findings
by
both
courts
below
--
and
i'm
reading
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
at
petitioner
appendix
page
33.
"the
district
court
found
that
race
is
indisputably
a
meaningful
factor
that
can
make
a
difference
in
the
evaluation
of
a
student's
application.
"
if
it
doesn't
make
a
difference,
then
we
have
a
clear
case;
they're
using
race
in
a
way
that
doesn't
make
a
difference.
the
supposition
has
to
be
that
race
is
a
determining
factor.
we've
heard
a
lot
about
holistic
and
all
that.
that's
fine.
but
unless
it's
a
determining
factor,
in
some
cases
they're
using
race
when
it
doesn't
serve
the
purpose
at
all.
that
can't
be
the
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
to
agree
that
it
makes
a
difference
in
some
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
get
back
to
what
we're
talking
about,
you
--
as
i
understand
it,
race
by
itself
is
taken
into
account,
right?
that's
the
only
thing
on
the
cover
of
the
application;
they
take
race
into
account.
and
the
district
court
found
--
and
you're
not
challenging
--
that
race
makes
a
difference
in
some
cases,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
gentlemen,
don't
write--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--general,
how
--
what
is
your
view
on
how
we
tell
whether
--
when
the
university
has
attained
critical
mass?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
i'm
hearing
a
lot
about
what
it's
not.
i'd
like
to
know
what
it
is
because
our
responsibility
is
to
decide
whether
this
use
of
race
is
narrowly
tailored
to
achieving,
under
this
university's
view,
critical
mass.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
rein,
10
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
keeping
the
playing
field
level.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-345,
fisher
versus
university
of
texas.
