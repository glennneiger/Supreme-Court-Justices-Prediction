justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rein,
before
we
get
to
that,
because
the
court
is
supposed
to
raise
it
on
its
own:
the
question
of
standing.
the
injury
--
if
the
injury
is
rejection
by
the
university
of
texas,
and
the
answer
is
no
matter
what,
this
person
would
not
have
been
accepted,
then
how
is
the
injury
caused
by
the
affirmative
action
program?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
on
that
specifically,
let's
take
away
the
10
percent
solution.
suppose
the
only
plan
were
the
one
that
is
before
the
court
now,
no
10
percent.
this
is
the
exclusive
way
that
the
university
is
attempting
to
increase
minority
enrollment.
then,
if
we
had
no
10
percent
solution,
under
grutter
would
this
plan
be
acceptable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then
the
question
is
can
you
have
both?
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
program
is
certainly
no
more
aggressive
than
the
one
in
grutter;
it's
more
--
in
fact,
more
modest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rein,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
your
talking
about
critical
mass,
you
are
relying
entirely
on
the
10
percent
is
enough.
they
don't
--
they
got
minorities
through
the
10
percent,
so
they
don't
need
any
more.
and
i
tried
to
get
you
rigidly
to
focus
on
--
forget
the
10
percent
plan.
this
is
the
entire
plan.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
of
the
10
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
the
race-neutral
alternative
is
the
10
percent
plan?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say,
and
that's
okay
because
it's
--
it's
race-neutral,
but
is
it
really?
i
mean,
the
--
the
only
reason
that
they
instituted
the
10
percent
plan
was
to
increase
minority
enrollment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
--
the
only
way
it
works
is
if
you
have
heavily
separated
schools.
and
worse
than
that,
i
mean,
if
you
--
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
university
of
texas
under
the
10
percent
plan,
you
go
to
the
low-performing
school,
you
don't
take
challenging
courses,
because
that's
how
you'll
get
into
the
10
percent.
so
maybe
the
university
is
concerned
that
that
is
an
inadequate
way
to
deal
with
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
could
you
explain
--
i
think
you
were
trying
to
before
--
what
seems
to
me
the
critical
question
in
this
case:
why
didn't
the
10
percent
solution
suffice?
there
were
a
substantial
number
of
minority
members
admitted
as
a
result
of
the
10
percent
solution.
why
wasn't
that
enough
to
achieve
diversity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
before
your
time
is
--
runs
out,
the
other
point
that
i'd
like
you
to
answer
is
the
argument
based
on
parents
involved,
that
the
gain
is
just
too
small
to
warrant
using
a
racial
criteria.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
once
you
have
the
10
percent,
you
don't
need
more.
so
how
do
you
answer
the
argument
of
it
being
too
small?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
same
--
the
same
would
be
true
in
--
of
the
bakke
plan,
that
in
some
cases
it's
going
to
make
a
difference.
the
same
would
be
true
under
grutter.
the
same
would
be
true
under
the
policies
now
in
existence
at
the
military
academies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
any
more
unchecked
than
the
harvard
plan
which
--
that
started
all
this
off
in
1978,
decided
by
justice
powell?
is
it
any
different
from
how
race
is
used
in
our
military
academies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
my
view,
the
courts
below
adhered
to
this
court's
path
marking
decisions
and
there
is
no
need
for
a
second
look.
my
dissenting
opinion
questions
the
--
the
starting
premise
on
which
this
case
has
proceeded.
texas'
top
ten
percent
law
requires
public
universities
to
admit
any
graduate
of
a
texas
high
school
ranked
in
the
top
ten
percent
of
her
class.
petitioner
calls
that
law
race-neutral
and
the
court
accepts
the
characterization.
the
diversity
achieved
by
the
top
ten
percent
law,
petitioner
urges,
is
accomplished
without
resort
to
a
racial
criterion
so
the
university
has
no
constitutionally
permissible
basis
for
treating
race
as
a
relevant
factor
in
reviewing
individual
admissions
applications.
in
truth,
is
the
top
ten
percent
law
racially
neutral
in
comparison
to
the
university's
explicit
regard
of
race
as
one
among
many
factors
relevant
to
its
educational
mission?
is
it
not
blindness
to
race,
but
indeed
race
consciousness
that
drives
percentage
plans
such
as
the
one
texas
has
adopted?
but
for
de
facto
racial
segregation
in
texas'
neighborhoods
and
schools,
there
would
be
no
top
ten
percent
law.
the
texas
legislature
deliberately
used
the
state's
demographics
primarily
to
achieve
a
measure
of
racial
diversity
in
the
state's
public
universities.
the
notion
that
the
top
ten
percent
law
is
race-neutral
calls
to
mind
professor
thomas
reed
powell's
famous
statement,
“if
you
think
you
can
think
about
a
thing
inextricably
attached
to
something
else
without
thinking
about
the
thing
to
which
it
is
attached,
then
you
have
a
legal
mind.”
only
that
kind
of
legal
mind
could
conclude
that
an
admissions
plan
specifically
designed
to
produce
racial
diversity
is
not
race
conscious.
i
have
several
times
explained
why
government
actors
including
state
universities
need
not
blind
themselves
to
the
still
lingering
everyday
evident
effects
of
centuries
of
law
sanctioned
inequality.
among
constitutionally
permissible
options,
i
remain
convinced,
those
that
candidly
disclose
what
they
are
doing
candidly
disclose
their
consideration
of
race
as
a
relevant
factor
are
preferable
to
plans
that
conceal
or
obscure
what
drives
them.
like
so
many
educational
institutions
across
the
nation,
the
university
of
texas
modeled
its
admission
plan
after
the
law
school
policy
approved
in
grutter
v.
bollinger
and
the
harvard
plan
referenced
as
exemplary
in
justice
powell's
opinion
in
regents
of
the
university
of
california
v.
bakke.
the
court
rightly
declines
to
cast
off
the
equal
protection
framework
settled
ten
years
ago
in
grutter.
yet
it
stops
short
of
reaching
the
conclusion
that
framework
warrants.
instead,
the
court
vacates
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
and
remands
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
assess
whether
the
university
has
offered
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
that
its
admissions
program
is
narrowly
tailored
to
obtain
the
educational
benefits
of
diversity.
as
i
see
it,
the
court
of
appeals
has
already
completed
that
inquiry
and
its
judgment,
trained
on
this
court's
bakke
and
grutter
path
markers,
merits
our
approbation.
