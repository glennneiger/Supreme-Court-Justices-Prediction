justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
this
was
before
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
comment
on
this,
and
then
i
hope
we
can
get
back
to
justice
alito's
question.
you
argue
that
the
university's
race-conscious
admission
plan
is
not
necessary
to
achieve
a
diverse
student
body
because
it
admits
so
few
people,
so
few
minorities.
and
i
had
trouble
with
that
reading
the
brief.
i
said,
well,
if
it's
so
few,
then
what's
the
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
--
let's
assume--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
it
resulted
in
the
admission
of
many
minorities.
then
you'd
come
back
and
say,
oh,
well,
this
is
--
this
shows
that
we
were
probably
wrongly
excluded.
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
see
an
inconsistency
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
--
are
you
saying
that
you
shouldn't
impose
this
hurt
or
this
injury,
generally,
for
so
little
benefit;
is
that
the
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
perhaps
you
could
summarize
by
saying
--
by
telling
us,
from
your
point
of
view,
this
plan
fails
strict
scrutiny
on
one
or
two
or
both
levels,
(a),
because
the
objective
is
inappropriate
or
ill
defined,
and,
(b),
because
of
the
implementation
is
defective.
which
or
both
of
those
are
you
arguing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
what
respect
does
this
plan
fail
strict
scrutiny
under
either
of
those
--
under
both
of
those
categories?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
what
counts
is
race
above
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
necessary
--
that's
the
necessary
response
to
justice
alito's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
underprivileged
of
a
certain
race
and
privileged
of
a
certain
race.
so
that's
race.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
reason
you're
reaching
for
the
privileged
is
so
that
members
of
that
race
who
are
privileged
can
be
representative,
and
that's
race.
i
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
i
could,
before
we
get
to
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
we
--
that
you,
in
your
experience
identify
a
numerical
category
a
numerical
standard,
a
numerical
designation
for
critical
mass:
it's
x
percent.
during
the
course
of
the
admissions
process,
can
the
admissions
officers
check
to
see
how
close
they
are
coming
to
this
numerical--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
--
you
cannot
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
that
what
happened
in
grutter;
it
allowed
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
are
you
saying
that
grutter
is
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
asking
whether
or
not
you
could
do
that.
and
if--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
understand
this
argument.
i
thought
that
the
whole
point
is
that
sometimes
race
has
to
be
a
tie-breaker
and
you
are
saying
that
it
isn't.
well,
then,
we
should
just
go
away.
then
--
then
we
should
just
say
you
can't
use
race,
don't
worry
about
it.

anthony
m.
kennedy
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
which
is
the
principal
campus
which
is
the
principal
campus
of
the
university
has
committed
itself
to
increasing
racial
minority
enrollment
on
campus.
the
university
considers
race
as
one
of
the
various
factors
in
its
undergraduate
admissions
process.
and
the
petitioner,
who
is
a
caucasian,
sued
the
university
after
her
application
was
rejected
and
she
contends
the
university's
use
of
race
in
the
admission
process
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
both
parties
move
for
summary
judgment,
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
university.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
it
held
that
courts
must
give
substantial
deference
to
the
university.
it
--
it
held
that
deference
must
be
given
both
in
the
definition
of
the
compelling
interest
in
diversity's
benefits
and
in
deciding
whether
the
specific
plan
was
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
its
stated
goal.
and
applying
that
standard,
the
court
upheld
the
university's
admissions
plan.
now,
among
the
court's
cases
involving
racial
classifications
in
education,
there
are
three
decisions
that
are
of
particular
relevance
here.
these
are
the
regents
of
the
university
of
california
versus
bakke,
gratz
versus
bollinger,
and
grutter
versus
bollinger.
in
the
bakke
case,
the
opinion
refers
to
the
concurring
opinion
by
justice
powell.
and
we
take
these
precedents
as
--
as
given
for
the
purposes
of
deciding
today's
case.
grutter
endorsed
justice
powell's
conclusion
in
bakke.
the
conclusion
was
that
the
attainment
of
a
diverse
student
body
is
a
constitutionally
permissible
goal
for
an
institution
of
higher
education.
grutter
also
made
clear
that
racial
classifications
are
constitutional
only
if
they
are
narrowly
tailored
to
further
compelling
governmental
interest.
thus,
under
grutter,
strict
scrutiny
must
be
applied
to
any
admissions
program
that
uses
racial
classifications
or
racial
categories.
grutter
concluded
that
the
decision
to
pursue
the
educational
benefits
that
flow
from
student
body
diversity
is
an
academic
judgment
to
which
some,
but
not
complete,
judicial
deference
is
proper.
the
court
of
course
should
ensure
that
there
is
a
reasoned,
principled
explanation
for
that
academic
decision
and
a
university
is
not
permitted
to
define
diversity
as
some
specified
percentage
of
a
particular
group
merely
because
of
that
group's
race
--
racial
or
ethnic
origin.
that
would
amount
to
outright
racial
balancing
which
is
patently
unconstitutional.
on
this
point,
in
today's
case,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct
in
finding
that
grutter
calls
for
some
deference
to
the
university's
experience
and
expertise.
now,
once
the
university
has
established
that
its
goal
of
diversity
is
consistent
with
strict
scrutiny,
there
still
must
be
a
further
judicial
determination
that
the
means
chosen
by
the
university
to
obtain
diversity
are
narrowly
tailored
to
that
goal.
and
on
this
point,
the
university
receives
no
deference.
as
the
court
said
in
grutter,
it
remains
at
all
times
the
university's
obligation
to
demonstrate
and
the
judiciary's
obligation
to
determine
that
the
admissions
processes
ensure
that
each
applicant
is
evaluated
as
an
individual
and
not
in
a
way
that
makes
an
applicant's
race
--
race
or
ethnicity
the
defining
feature
of
his
or
her
application.
narrow
tailoring
also
requires
that
the
reviewing
court
verify
that
it
is
necessary
for
a
university
to
use
race
to
achieve
the
educational
benefits
of
diversity,
and
this
involves
a
careful
judicial
inquiry
into
whether
a
university
could
achieve
sufficient
diversity
without
using
racial
classifications.
and
the
opinion
today
sets
forth
in
more
detail
the
strict
scrutiny
process
that
courts
must
undertake
in
these
cases.
rather
than
perform
a
searching
examination
that
is
required,
however,
here,
the
court
of
appeals
held
petitioner
could
challenge
only
“whether
the
university's
decision
to
reintroduce
race
as
a
factor
in
admissions
was
made
in
good
faith.”
it
held
that
in
considering
that
challenge,
the
court
would
presume
the
university
acted
in
good
faith
and
placed
on
petitioner
the
burden
of
rebutting
that
presumption.
the
expression
of
the
controlling
standard
of
strict
scrutiny
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
at
odds
with
grutter's
command
that
all
racial
classifications
imposed
by
government
must
be
analyzed
by
a
reviewing
court
under
strict
scrutiny.
gutter
did
--
grutter
did
not
hold
that
good
faith
would
get
--
would
forgive
an
impermissible
consideration
of
race
and
the
higher
education
dynamic
does
not
change
the
narrow
tailoring
analysis
of
strict
scrutiny
applicable
in
other
contexts.
strict
scrutiny
must
not
be
strict
in
theory
but
fatal
in
fact,
but
the
opposite
is
also
true.
strict
scrutiny
must
not
be
strict
in
theory
but
feeble
in
fact.
in
order
for
judicial
review
to
be
meaningful,
a
university
must
make
a
showing
that
its
plan
is
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
the
only
interest
that
this
court
has
approved
in
this
context.

benefits
of
a
student
body

that
encompasses
a
broad
array
of
qualifications
and
characteristics
of
which
racial
or
ethnic
origin
is
but
a
single
though
important
element.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
confined
the
strict
scrutiny
inquiry
in
too
narrow
a
way
by
deferring
to
the
university's
good
faith
in
its
use
of
racial
classification
and
this
court
now
vacates
that
judgment.
fairness
to
the
litigants
and
to
the
courts
that
heard
the
case
requires
that
the
matter
be
remanded
so
that
the
admissions
process
can
be
considered
and

under
a
correct
analysis.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated,
and
the
case
is

this
