justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
get
past
texas
v.
lesage
with
that
injury,
which
says
that
mere
use
of
race
is
not
cognizable
injury
sufficient
for
standing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
go
to
another
side?
she's
graduated.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
she
disclaimed
the
desire
after
her
application
to
go
to
the
school
at
all.
she
was
permitted
to
apply
for
the
summer
program
and
get
in
automatically,
and
she
didn't,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
she's
graduated.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
injunctive
relief,
she's
not
going
to
get.
so
what
measure
of
damages
will
she
get
or
will
she
be
entitled
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
have
to
claim
an
injury,
so
what's
the
injury--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
you're
claiming
that
would
sustain
a
claim
of
damages?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
still
haven't
answered
how
lesage
gets
away
from
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
if
there's
a
--
give
me
another--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--damages
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
damages--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
one
social
studies
that
this
university
did
said
that
minority
students
overwhelmingly,
even
with
the
numbers
they
have
now,
are
feeling
isolated.
so
what
do
--
why
isn't
that
even
under
your
test?
we
can
go
back
to
whether
substantial
evidence
is
adequate,
is
necessary,
or
not.
why
does
their
test
fail?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
could
you
tell
me
what
a
critical
mass
was?
i'm
looking
at
the
number
of
blacks
in
the
university
of
texas
system.
pre-grutter,
when
the
state
was
indisputably
still
segregating,
it
was
4
percent.
today,
under
the
post-grutter
system,
it's
6
percent.
the
2
percent
increase
is
enough
for
you,
even
though
the
state
population
is
at
12
percent?
somehow,
they've
reached
a
critical
mass
with
just
the
2
percent
increase?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
--
putting
aside
--
i
don't
--
i'm
not
going
to
quarrel
with
you
that
if
demographics
alone
were
being
used,
i
would
be
somewhat
concerned.
but
you
can't
seriously
suggest
that
demographics
aren't
a
factor
to
be
looked
at
in
combination
with
how
isolated
or
not
isolated
your
student
body
is
actually
reporting
itself
to
feel?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
might
be
--
it
might
be
insulting
to
some
to
be
thrown
into
a
pot.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
are
you
telling
us
is
the
standard
of
critical
mass?
at
what
point
does
a
district
court
or
a
university
know
that
it
doesn't
have
to
do
any
more
to
equalize
the
desegregation
that
has
happened
in
that
particular
state
over
decades,
that
it's
now
going
to
be
stuck
at
a
fixed
number
and
it
has
to
change
its
rules.
what's
that
fixed
number?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
they
told
--
they
told
the
district
court.
they
took
a
study
of
students.
they
analyzed
the
composition
of
their
classes,
and
they
determined
in
their
educational
judgment
that
greater
diversity,
just
as
we
said
in
grutter,
is
a
goal
of
their
educational
program,
and
one
that
includes
diversifying
classes.
so
what
more
proof
do
you
require?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
given
it
was
in
the
evidence,
what
more
do
you
think
they
needed?
i
think
i
hear
all
you
saying
in
your
brief
is
the
number's
fixed
now,
they
got
enough,
no
more
is
necessary.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
enough
now.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
--
tell
me
what
about
their
use
of
race
did
not
fit
the
narrow
tailoring,
not
the
necessity
prong
as
you've
defined
it,
but
the
narrow
tailoring
that
grutter
required?
how
is
race
used
by
them
in
a
way
that
violated
the
terms
of
grutter?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
that
the
need
is
there.
i
know
you're
challenging
the
need.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
have
to
set
a
quota
for
critical
mass?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we
won't
call
it
a
quota;
we'll
call
it
a
goal,
something
grutter
said
you
shouldn't
have.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
boy,
it
sounds
awfully
like
a
quota
to
me
that
grutter
said
you
should
not
be
doing,
that
you
shouldn't
be
setting
goals,
that
you
shouldn't
be
setting
quotas;
you
should
be
setting
an
individualized
assessment
of
the
applicants.
tell
me
how
this
system
doesn't
do
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
we're
going
to
tell
the
universities
how
to
run
and
how
to
weigh
qualifications,
too?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
again
how
race
and
their
use
of
race
overwhelms
those
other
factors
in
their
system
as
it's
created?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
are
the
one
who
in
your
brief
has
assumed
that
they
are
valuing
different
races
differently.
but
asian
numbers
have
gone
up,
under
however
they
have
structured
this
pai.
and
as
i
understand
their
position,
race
is
balanced
against
other
issues
like
socioeconomics,
the
strength
of
the
classes
people
took.
it's
never
a
stand
alone.
so
even
a
white
student,
i
presume,
who
goes
to
an
entirely
black
or
an
entirely
latino
school,
who
becomes
class
president
would
get
some
points
because
he
has
or
she
has
proven
that
they
foster
or
can
deal
in
a
diverse
environment.
that's
how
i
understood
their
plan;
that
it's
not
just
giving
you
a
plus
because
of
race,
it's
combining
that
with
other
factors.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
put
that
in
the
narrow
tailoring
category,
that
it
is
narrowly
tailored
the
way
grutter
did,
said.
not
the
necessity
prong
and
not
the
need
prong.
not
the
necessity
prong.
i
think
most
of
his
argument
has
been
centered
on
that,
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
garre,
i
think
that
the
issue
that
my
colleagues
are
asking
is,
at
what
point
and
when
do
we
stop
deferring
to
the
university's
judgment
that
race
is
still
necessary?
that's
the
bottom
line
of
this
case.
and
you're
saying,
and
i
think
rightly
because
of
our
cases,
that
you
can't
set
a
quota,
because
that's
what
our
cases
say
you
can't
do.
so
if
we're
not
going
to
set
a
quota,
what
do
you
think
is
the
standard
we
apply
to
make
a
judgment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
i
think,
as
i
take
your
answer,
is
that
the
supposition
of
justice
alito's
question
is
truly
impossible
under
this
system.
there
are
not
two
identical
candidates
because
there
are
not
identical
mechanical
factors
that
--
except
the
10
percent
plan.
under
the
pia,
the
factors
are
so
varied,
so
contextually
set,
that
no
two
applicants
ever
could
be
identical
in
the
sense
that
they
hypothesize.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
no
two
people
can
be
the
same--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
your
complaint
limited
to
injunctive
relief
and
the
return
of
the
$100?
as
written,
is
that
what
it's
limited
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
arizonans
and
alvarez
we
said
any
all
--
any
and
other
--
all
damages
is
too
speculative.
is
what
you
actually
see
what
i
said:
injunctive
relief
and
the
return
of
the
$100.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
arizonans
and
alvarez
we
said
you
can't
manufacture
standing
after
the
fact.
did
you
ask
only
for
injunctive
relief
and
the
$100,
specifically?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you
would
have
paid
that
no
matter
what;
under
any
system
of
admission
you
would
have
paid
the
same
$100.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
for
what,
nominal
damages?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
then
how
do
you
get
around
arizonans?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
she
was
going
to
get
a
better
job
because
she
went
to
a
different
university?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
not
suggesting
that
if
every
minority
student
that
got
into
a
university
got
into
only
the
physical
education
program;
and
in
this
particular
university
that
--
that
physical
education
program
includes
all
the
star
athletes;
so
every
star
athlete
in
the
school
happens
to
be
black
or
hispanic
or
asian
or
something
else,
but
they
have
now
reached
the
critical
mass
of
10,
15,
20
percent
--
that
the
university
in
that
situation
couldn't
use
race?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
holistic
way
that
grutter
permits?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
it's
just
that
every
one
of
their
students
who
happens
to
be
a
minority
is
going
to
end
up
in
that
program.
you
don't
think
the
university
could
consider
that
it
needs
a
different
diversity
in
its
other
departments?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
aren't
they
saying
the
same
thing
when
they
say,
when
we
are
looking
at
the
holistic
measure,
we
are
looking
for
that
student
who
is
a
--
that
minority
student
who
is
a
nuclear
scientist?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
don't
want
to
overrule
grutter,
you
just
want
to
gut
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
just
want
to
gut
it.
you
don't
want
to
overrule
it,
but
you
just
want
to
gut
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
you
want
to
tell
universities
that
once
you
reach
a
certain
number,
then
you
can't
use
race
anymore.
