mr.
bert
w.
rein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
mr.
chief
justice,
general
suter
trained
me
too
well.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
central
issue
here
is
whether
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
can
carry
its
burden
approving
that
its
use
of
race
as
an
admissions-plus
factor
in
the
consequent
denial
of
equal
treatment,
which
is
the
central
mandate
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
to
abigail
fisher
met
the
two
tests
of
strict
scrutiny
which
are
applicable.
first--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
first
injury
that
was
before
the
court
was
the
use
of
a
system
which
denied
equal
treatment.
it
was
a
constitutional
injury,
and
part
of
the
damage
claim
was
premised
directly
on
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
lesage
was
litigated
on
its
merits,
and
the
question
was
whether
lesage
could
carry
his
case
when
--
on
summary
judgment
when
it
was
apparent
that
his
complaint,
which
was
that
he
was
denied
access
to
the
graduate
program
at
the
university
of
texas,
was
not
sustainable.
as
i
said
--
and
there
are
several
factors
in
this
case
that
are
quite
different.
first,
there
is
a
constitutional
injury
as
such,
and
the
court
has
recognized
it.
second,
the
fact
premise,
she
could
not
have
been
allowed
in
under
any
circumstance,
was
never
tested
below,
wasn't
raised
below.
it
comes
up
in
a
footnote
in--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--correct.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
she
--
she
was
not
automatically
admitted.
she
was
considered
for
the
summer
program
and
rejected.
you
are
talking
about
the
cap
program,
where
she
could
have
attended
a
different
university
in
the
texas
system,
and
had
she
been
able
to
achieve--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--she
has
graduated.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
that
issue,
of
course,
is
bifurcated,
and
we've
reserved
the
ability
to--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--the
denial
of
her
right
to
equal
treatment
is
a
constitutional
injury
in
and
of
itself,
and
we
had
claimed
certain
damages
on
that.
we
--
we
started
the
case
before
it
was
clear
whether
she
would
or
wouldn't
be
admitted.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
if
there's--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
i
think--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--on
the
--
if
we
then,
on
remand,
were
to
assert
damages
contingent
upon
the
fact
that
she
should
have
been
admitted
to
ut
and
was
not
admitted,
we
would
then
have
to
prove
that
but
for
the
use
of
race
she
would
be
admitted.
that's
the
thrust
of
lesage.
whether
we
can
prove
it
or
can't
prove
it
is
something
you
can't
tell
on
this
record.
it's
merely
asserted.
and
i
would
point
out
that
texas
said
below,
there
was
no
way
to
determine
that
issue
without--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--no,
sir.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
that
is
our
correct,
and
that
is
our
first
premise.
and
i
would
say
that
the
same
issue
was
raised
in
bakke.
and
in
bakke,
the
contention
was
he
couldn't
have
gotten
into
the
medical
school;
therefore,
he
has
no
case.
the
court
said,
in
footnote
14
to
justice
powell's
opinion,
that's
a
matter
of
merits;
it
is
not
a
matter
of
standing.
i
think
in
parents
involved,
the
same
type
of
contention
was
made
with
respect
to
the
louisville
class
plaintiffs
whose
son
had
been
admitted
to
the
school
of
his
choice,
and
the
court
said
damages
are
enough
to
sustain
standing.
there
is
a
live
damages
claim
here,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
a
question
of
standing.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
yes,
justice
scalia,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
justice
breyer,
we
have
said
very
carefully
we
were
not
trying
to
change
the
court's
disposition
of
the
issue
in
grutter,
could
there
be
a
legitimate,
a
compelling
interest
in
moving
--
in
using
race
to
establish
a
diverse
class.
what
--
the
problem
that
we've
encountered
throughout
the
case
is
there
are
varying
understandings,
not
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
interest,
but
how
you
get
there;
is
it
necessary
to
use
race
to
achieve
that
interest;
what
does
a
critical
mass--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--we
litigated
it
on
that
basis,
yes.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
justice
breyer,
our
argument
is
we
can
satisfy
grutter
if
it's
properly
read.
what
we've
seen--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
i
think
that
there
would
be
flaws
under
grutter
even
if
you
assumed
away
something
that
can't
be
assumed
away
because
it
is
a
matter
of
texas
law,
that
is,
there
is
a
top
10
percent
program,
and
that--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
i
don't
agree
with
that,
and
let
me
explain
why.
in
order
to
satisfy
grutter,
you
first
have
to
say
that
you
are
not
just
using
race
gratuitously,
but
it
is
in
the
interest
of
producing
a
critical
mass
of
otherwise
underrepresented
students.
and
so
to
be
within
grutter
framework,
the
first
question
is,
absent
the
use
of
race,
would
we
be
generating
a
critical
mass?
to
answer
that
question,
you
start
--
you've
got
to
examine
in
context
the
so-called
soft
factors
that
are
in
grutter.
you
know,
are
--
is
there
an
isolation
on
campus?
do
members
of
minority
feel
that
they
cannot
speak
out?
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
the
survey
was
--
a
random
survey.
it's
not
reported
in
any
systematic
way.
they
evidently
interviewed
students.
and
it
was
all
about
classroom
isolation.
it
wasn't
about--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--it
was
done
after
president
faulkner
had
made
the
declaration
they
were
going
to
do
it.
it
was
done
before--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--on
the
--
i
believe,
on
the
same
day.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no,
i
don't.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
i'm
not
sure
we
agree
with
those
courts
in
their
method
of
analysis.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
and
--
particularly
in
the
case
of
considering
alternatives
that
have
worked
about
as
well,
i
think
that's
a
legal
question
this
court
is
free
to
act
on.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
so
if
i
might
try
to
answer
your
question,
there
was
no
effort
in
this
case
to
establish
even
a
working
target
for
critical
mass.
they
simply
ignored
it.
they
just
used
words
and
they
said
we've
got
to
do
more.
so
they
never
answered
the
predicate
question
which
grutter
asks:
absent
the
use
of
race,
can
we
generate
a
critical
mass?
so
--
i
mean,
that's
a
flaw
we
think
is
in
grutter.
we
think
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
restate
that
principle.
now,
whether
that--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--no.
i--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--and
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
scalia,
that
is
correct.
and
in
addition,
the
courts
didn't
find
whether
a
critical
mass--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
we
don't
believe
that
demographics
are
the
key
to
underrepresentation
of
critical
mass.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
i
think
if
you
start
to
split
out
subgroups
of
minorities,
you
mistake
i
think
what
i
think
is
the
proper
thrust
of
grutter,
or
at
least
ought
to
be.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
certainly
--
racial
balance--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
scalia,
racial
balancing
is
not
a
permissible
interest,
and
we
are
constantly
--
this
court
has
constantly
held
not
a
permissible
interest.
and
that
is
something
we
certainly
agree
with.
trying
to
respond
to
justice
sotomayor
and
in
the
framework
of
grutter,
what
you're
looking
at
is,
do
you
--
does
this
person,
member
of
a
so-called
underrepresented
minority
--
it's
a
concept
we
don't
necessarily
accept,
but
it's
texas's
concept
--
are
they
isolated?
are
they
unable
to
speak
out?
and
i
think
we've
always
said
if
you
have
a
very
large
number,
as
texas
did
in
2004
when
they
ostensibly
made
the
decision
to
reinstitute
race,
they
had
a
21
percent
admission
percentage
of
what
they
called
the
underrepresented
minorities.
they
also
had
about
an
18
percent
admission
ratio
of
asian-americans.
so
on
campus,
you're
talking
about
--
about
40
percent
of
the
class
being
minorities.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
yes.
it
said
expressly
in
grutter--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--in
grutter,
the
court
assumed
that
the
very
small
number
of
admissions,
minority
admissions,
looked
at
as
the
whole
--
and
it
was
looked
at
as
a
whole,
only
as
a
whole
in
grutter
--
would
have
yielded
about
3
or
4
percent
minority
admission
in
a
class
of
350,
which
means
about
12
to
15
students--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--we
--
it's
not
our
burden
to
establish
the
number.
it
was
the
burden
of
the
university
of
texas
to
determine
whether--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
if
you
are
allowed
to
state
all
the
grounds
that
need
to
be
proved,
you
will
always
prove
them,
in
all
fairness,
justice
sotomayor.
the
question
is,
they
have--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--what
we're
saying
in
the
brief
was
they
were
generating
in
fact
a
very
substantial
number
of
minority
presence
on
campus.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
and--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--no.
and
that
immediately
thrust
upon
them
the
responsibility,
if
they
wanted
to
--
you
know,
essentially
move
away
from
equal
treatment,
they
had
to
establish
we
have
a
purpose,
we
are
trying
to
generate
a
critical
mass
of
minorities
that
otherwise
could
not
be
achieved.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
and
for
this
purpose--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--put
--
put
aside
whether
this
was
necessary
and
whether
it
was
an
appropriate
last
resort
in
a
quest
for
diversity
and
critical
mass,
because
grutter's
not
without
limits.
but
i'll
put
that
aside
and
let
me
come
directly
to
your
question.
first
of
all,
if
you
think
about
narrow
tailoring,
you
can't
tailor
to
the
unknown.
if
you
have
no
range
of
evaluation,
if
you
have
no
understanding
of
what
critical
mass
means,
you
can't
tailor
to
it.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no.
there's
a
huge
difference,
and
it's
an
important
one
that
is
not
well
put
out
by
the
university
of
texas.
having
a
range,
a
view
as
to
what
would
be
an
appropriate
level
of
comfort,
critical
mass,
as
defined
in
grutter,
allows
you
to
evaluate
where
you
are--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
distinguish
between
the
operative
use
of
that
range,
in
other
words,
that's
where
we
are,
and
we're
going
to
use
race
until
we
get
there
every
year
in
consideration
of
each
application,
which
was
a
problem.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
this
system
doesn't
--
i
mean,
it's
not
narrowly
tailored
because
it
doesn't
fit.
there
are
certain
forms
of
grutter
that
it
follows.
it--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
it
simply
reiterated
the
language
of
grutter.
they
have
no
definition.
they
can't
fit--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
let
me
tell
you
that
if
you
look
outside
the
top
10,
at
the
so-called
ai/pai
admits
only
--
forget
the
top
10
for
a
minute,
they
were
generating
approximately
15
percent
minority
admissions
outside
the
top
10,
which
is
in
--
above
what
the
target
was
in
grutter.
so
this
is
not
grutter
on
its
facts.
it's
vastly
different.
this
is
a--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--no,
it
was
--
i'm
talking
about
only
the
non-top
10
percent
admissions.
15
percent
of
those
were
so-called
underrepresented
minorities.
this
is
without
the
top
10.
now,
the
top
10
is
also
a
major
generator
of
admissions
for
underrepresented
minorities.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no.
with
the
10
percent
plan,
it's
much
higher.
in
2004,
it
was
21
percent
for
just
hispanics
and
african
americans,
and
these
are
the
categories
they
used.
if
you
add
in
asians,
it
was
over
38
percent.
but
i'm
isolating
--
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
isolating
to
the
non-top
10
admissions.
those
are
over
15
percent
in
that
year,
and
they
average
very
close
to
that
over
time.
so
the
--
the
total
generation
of
minority
presence
is
a
combination
of
the
two
in
fact,
but
the
ai/pai
system
--
which
was
adopted
in
response
to
hopwood.
it
was
--
as
texas
says,
it
was
the
first
thing
they
tried
to
accommodate
to
their
loss
of
the
ability
to
use
race
directly,
which
came
up
in
hopwood.
so
that
was
their
first
response,
to
look
at
a
more
balanced
admission
program
between
academic
index
and
personal
achievement
index.
so
it
is
not
a
system
which
just
excludes
minorities.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
it's
a
question--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--excuse
me,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
yes,
that's
part
of
it.
the
second
is
the
question
of
reasonably
available
alternatives.
if
we
take
texas
at
its
word,
and
it
says
they
are
satisfied,
they
are
happy
going
on
with
the
way
they
apply
race
today,
we
tried
to
measure,
well,
what
difference
is
it
making,
and
could
you
achieve
the
same
thing
with
a
reasonably
available
race-neutral
alternative.
that's
a
question
that
was
asked
in
grutter.
they
were
supposed
to
analyze
that.
they
didn't
look
at
it.
but
it--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--the
race-neutral
alternative
includes
an
extension
of
the
10
percent
plan
because
it's
a
major
generator
of
minority
admissions.
and
right
now,
that
ranges
at
30
percent.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
we
say--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--but,
justice
ginsburg,
let
--
let
me
say
that
--
that
a
lot
of
that
is
speculative.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it.
we
don't
know.
they've
never
surveyed
the
top
10
admits,
the
minority
admits,
to
see,
well,
did
you--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--correct.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
correct.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
yes.
and
even
the
fifth
circuit
said
you
can't
disregard
its
consequences
because
it's
a
matter
of
law.
i'm
simply
saying
they
could
choose
to
extend
it
beyond
where
it
is
because
it's
capped
today
at
75
percent.
but
that's
not
the
only
option.
that's
not
the
only
alternative.
and
certainly
one
simple
alternative
is
they
could
look
at
the
yield,
that
is,
what
percentage
of
the
admitted
minorities
are
they
actually
encouraging
and
--
and
enrolling.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--but
justice--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
breyer,
just
--
i
will
answer
your
question.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
little
time.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no,
i
am
perfectly
happy
to
--
to
answer
your
question.
i
think
that
the
increase
in
african
american
admissions
that
you're
looking
at
was
pre-grutter.
it
was
generated
before
2004.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
so
i
just
want
to
make
clear
the
record
doesn't
depend
--
they
don't
depend
on
race
to
do
it.
it's
minimal
change
with
the
use
of
race.
and
that's
why
we
say
there
is
an
alternative
which
would
serve
it
about
as
well
in
increasing
yield
or,
indeed,
in
reweighting
the
--
the
pai,
which
is
a
critical
element
here,
so
that
you
put
more
emphasis
on
the
socioeconomic
factors
and
less
emphasis
on
the
essays,
which
are
an
academic
measure
within
the
pai.
so
there
are
lots
that
they
could
do--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--it's
not
the
job
of
the
court
to
tell
them
how
to
do
it.
it's
their
job
to
examine
the
alternatives
available
to
them
and
see
if
they
couldn't
achieve
the
same
thing.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
i
--
the
question
is
not
whether
it
overwhelms
them.
they're
--
but
they
say,
they
admit,
it
is
effective.
there
are
admissions
that
would
not
have
taken
place
but
for;
somebody
else
would
have
had
that
place
but
for
the
use
of
race.
and
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
just
to
answer
your
question
fully,
you
have
to
analyze
race-neutral
alternatives.
and
if
you
look
at
parents
involved,
that
--
that
was
the
critical
question.
the
--
the
outcomes
were
so
small
that
there
were
readily
available
alternatives.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
we
have
argued
both,
and
we
continue
to
argue
both.
it
is
not
a
necessary--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--okay.
under
the
category
--
the
first
category,
was
it
a
necessary
means
of
pursuing
a
compelling
interest,
we
don't
believe
they've
shown
any
necessity
for
doing
what
they
were
doing.
and
certainly,
it
--
race
should
have
been
a
last
resort;
it
was
a
first
resort.
that's,
in
a
nutshell,
that
prong
of
it.
and
in
order
--
and
they
failed
in
every
respect.
if
you
go
to
narrow
tailoring,
what
we
are
saying
is
they
didn't
consider
alternatives,
and
their
treatment
of,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
asian
americans
and
hispanics
makes
a
--
an
incomprehensible
distinction.
they
say,
we
don't
worry
about
asians,
there
are
a
lot
of
asians,
it's
a
demographic
measure,
which
is
a
forbidden
measure.
they
are
in
excess
of
their
share
of
the
texas
population.
but
if
you
are
trying
to
find
individual
comfort
levels,
if
you
are
breaking
it
down
between
african
americans
and
--
and
hispanics,
the--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--there
is
a
plus
because
of
race.
there
are
many
other
factors
in
the
decision.
and
might
i
say
that
this
--
the
white
student
president
of
the
class
in
an
ethnically
different
school
is
a
measure
of
leadership.
leadership
is
an
independent
factor
in
the
pai.
it
isn't
--
he
is
not
getting
that
point
because
of
his
race;
he's
getting
that
point
because
of
his
leadership.
that
race-neutral
criteria
could
work
for
anybody.
so
race
is
an
independent
add-on,
it
is
something
that
can
be
used
to
boost
the
pai
score,
the
pas
element
in
any
way
they
like,
because
they
say
they
contextualize
it,
and
we
say
it's
not
necessary,
it's
not
narrowly
tailored,
it
ignores
available
alternatives,
it
treats
--
gives
disparate
treatment
to
asian
americans,
because
they
are
minorities
as
well,
and
to
the
extent
it
depends
on
the
classroom
factor
there
is
simply
no
way
to
relate
or
fit
what
they
are
doing
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
they
used
as
a
major
foundation
of
their
proposal,
which
is
the
nondiverse
classroom.
that
--
certainly
there
is
just
no
correspondence
there.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
thank
you.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
it's
the
only--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--the
reason
why
the
payment
of
that
fee
doesn't
redress
the
injury,
your
honor,
is
that
she
would
have
paid
it
even
if
texas
didn't
consider
race
at
all;
and,
therefore,
the
payment
of
the
application
fee
back
doesn't
remedy
the
injury
that
she
is
complaining
about.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
more
than
i
expected.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
that's
what
we're
seeking
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
level
playing
field
for
abby
fisher.
so
it's
most
apt
at
this
point.
there's
just
three
things
i
want
to
touch
on.
first,
there's
been
a
lot
of
back
and
forth
on
standing,
but,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
that
really
relates
to
merits.
and
i
just
want
to
make
clear
that
we
do
not
accept
the
premise
of
that
footnote,
that
she
would
not
have
entered
under
any
circumstances;
that
they've
asserted
that,
but,
in
fact,
she
was
considered
for
the
summer
program,
which
is--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--no,
because
it
said,
“
any
and
all
other
damages
”,
at
the
point
when
we
were
writing
it,
which
was--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we
never
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
the
full
damages--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--because
of--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--the
only
specific
number
in
the
complaint,
because
of
the
point
in
time
when
it
was
filed
was
the
application
fee,
which
we
believe--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--you
would
have
paid
the
fee
in
return
for
a
fair
processing
of
the
application,
which
she
did
not
receive,
and
we
think
that
is
a
claim
that
will
be
sustained.
it
is
not
tested
at
this
point.
and
the
second
thing
is,
because
of
the
way
the
case
was
bifurcated,
with
the
agreement
of
all
and
the
district
court
as
well,
we
did
not
develop
the
additional
damages
here.
we
reserved
the
right
to
amend,
and
as
things
have
progressed--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--no--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--because
as
--
as
in
the
bio,
what
ut
pointed
out
was
there
are
other
kinds
of
financial
injuries
which
were
not
ascertainable
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed
because
we
were
trying
to
put
her
into
the
university.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
that's
one
of
the
things
they
suggested.
there
are
differences
in
cost
between
the
--
what
she
paid
at
lsu
and
what
she
would
have
paid
at
ut.
i'm
just
saying,
these
are
all
reserved
questions
and
they
don't
go
to
standing.
the
court
made
that
clear
in
bakke.
let
me
go
to
another
issue
that,
you
know,
i
think
i
never
completed
my
answer
to
justice
breyer.
where
we
stand
on
what
you
should
do
about
grutter
is
as
follows.
we
recognize,
as
in
the
words
of
--
that
the
solicitor
general
just
issued
--
that
there
is
an
interest
which
is
cognizable
in
diversity.
that
is
--
that
was
the
root
question
in
grutter,
could
you
recognize
it
at
all.
but
what
we
are
concerned
about,
as
you
are
seeing
here,
is
universities
like
ut
and
many
others
have
read
it
to
be
green
light,
use
race,
no
end
point,
no
discernible
target,
no
critical
mass,
you
know,
in
circumstances
reduced
to
something
that
can
be
reviewed.
and
as
long
as
you
don't
cross
two
lines,
determinative
points
and
fixed
quotas
--
“
quotas
”
meaning
we
will
fill
this
quota
exclusively
with
who
we
deem
to
be
under-represented
--
you
are
okay.
we
don't
think
that's
the
way
grutter
was
intended.
grutter
was
intended
to
say
this
is
an
area
of
great
caution;
using
race
itself
raises
all
kinds
of
red
flags,
so
before
you
use
race
make
a
determination
whether
really,
your
interest
in
critical
mass
--
that
is,
in
the
dialogue
and
interchange,
the
educational
interest,
is
that--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
i
think
you
are
talking
about--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
if
you
are
saying
there's
a
--
a
differentiated
department
of
physical
education,
which
is
like
a
separate
college,
you
have
changed
the
nature
of
the
hypothetical.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
if
that
were
the
case,
remember
the
factor
that
is
causing
it,
and
you
are
assuming,
is
choice.
you
have
a
critical
mass
of
students.
they
choose
to
major
in
different
things,
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
the
classroom
diversity
concept.
they
never
asked
the
question
why,
if
40
percent
of
our
students
are
minorities,
are
they
not
in
the
small
classrooms?
why
does
that
happen?
statistically
you
would
say
that's
an
aberration.
you
might
ask
the
question
what's
causing
it?
because
in
order
to
fit--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--no.
because
they
don't
take
into
account
your
interests,
they
don't
ask
you,
are
you
going
to
join
rotc,
they
don't
ask
you
are
you
going
to
major
--
major
in
physics.
and
when
it
comes
time
in
the
ut
system
to
allocate
access
to
different
majors,
they
do
that
in
a
way
that
is
basically
premised
on
academic
index.
so
they
have
a
two-tiered
admission
system.
they
are
only
here
focused
--
their
preference
goes
to
admission
as
such,
it
doesn't
go
to
sorting
people
out
by
majors.
and
if
i
might
then
say
to
justice
breyer,
i
think
our
answer
is,
when
we
see
what
ut
is
doing,
what
we
that
--
grutter's
--
you
know,
it
has
been
perceived
as
a
green
light;
go
ahead
and
use
race,
race
which
is
otherwise
really
a
highly
questionable,
an
abominable
kind
of
sorting
out.
that
unchecked
use
of
race,
which
we
think
is
--
has
been
spawned
by
misreading
of
grutter,
needs
to
be
corralled.
so
what
we--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
i
mean,
they
are
two
different
questions.
the
harvard
plan
is
a
very
different
world.
it's
a
plan
of
wholly
individualized
admission
comparing
individuals
one
on
one,
to
establish
the
platonic
ideal
of
the
class
as
the
educational
mission.
this
is
not
what
is
going
on
at
ut.
this
is
not
an
individualized,
i
will
look
at
you.
i
will
score
you.
i
will
score
you
individually.
but
as
they
keep
saying,
at
the
point
of
admission,
i
am
not
admitting
people;
i
am
admitting
categories,
boxes;
and
that
relates
to
justice
alito's
question.
i
thought
your
hypothetical,
justice
alito,
was
entirely
fair,
because
in
the
way
they
do
their
system,
in
the
pai
scoring,
you
can
figure
out
that
two
people
would
have
had
the
same
pai
score
but
for
race.
it's
an
add-on.
it
allows
them
to
boost
the
pas
component
of
the
pai
score.
so
--
it
is
not
infrequent.
there
are
many,
many
candidates
who
will
score
the
same
pai,
may
even
have
the
same
ai,
and
then
you
boost
some
of
them.
now,
what
ut
says
is,
well,
we
don't
boost
all
the
minorities.
and
that
--
they
stood
here
today,
and
they
said
in
their
briefs,
we
want
to
boost
the
ones
we
like.
we
want
those
affluent
minorities
who
we
think
will
improve,
in
our
view,
dialogue.
that
is
contrary
indeed
to
the
fact
that
they
give
points
in
the
same
system
for
socioeconomic
disadvantage.
it's
at
odds
with
itself.
but
it's
purely
race,
and
it
comes
to
the
ultimate
question
then,
which,
chief
justice,
you
were
asking:
where
is
the
end
point?
if
you
have
nothing
to
gauge
the
success
of
the
program,
if
you
can't
even
say
at
the
beginning
we
don't
have
critical
mass
because
we
don't
know
what
it
is
and
we
refuse
to
say
what
it
is,
there
is
no
judicial
supervision,
there
is
no
strict
scrutiny
and
there
is
no
end
point
to
what
they
are
doing.
so
what
we
have
said,
and
it
comes
right
back
to
justice
breyer,
how
would
you
write
it,
you
can
clarify
it,
you
can
say
grutter
properly
applies,
requires
you
to
do
a,
b,
c,
and
--
and
we've
said
in
our
brief
that
would
be
satisfactory.
but
to
the
extent
that
you
then
have
it
surviving
side
by
side,
there
could
be
enormous
confusion.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
i'm
saying
if
you
clarify
the
needs
and
the
necessity
point,
if
you
then
look
at
some
of
the
other
deficiencies
and
clarify
the
--
the
consideration
of
reasonably
available
alternatives
as
a
necessity,
if
you
then
attribute
that
--
you
attribute
the
weaknesses
of
the
texas
program
to
the
absence
of
those
factors,
i
think
you
can
fashion
a
result
in
this
case
which
may
or
may
not
have
to,
quote,
“
overrule
”
grutter.
it's
really
a
matter,
what
do
you
--
do
you
want
to
clearly
restate
what
it
is
that
allows
the
use
of
this
odious
classification?
that's
what
we
are
talking
about,
it's
a
narrow
window;
and
it
should
be
stated
as
a
narrow
window.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
excuse
me?
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
sotomayor,
i
don't
want
to
gut
it.
and
the
only
way
one
could
reach
that
conclusion
is
to
assume
that
grutter
is
an
unlimited
mandate
without
end
point
to
just
use
race
to
your
own
satisfaction
and
to
be
deferred
to
in
your
use
of
race.
that
is
unacceptable.
that
is
the
invasion
of
abigail
fisher's
rights
to
equal
protection
under
the
law.
thank
you.
