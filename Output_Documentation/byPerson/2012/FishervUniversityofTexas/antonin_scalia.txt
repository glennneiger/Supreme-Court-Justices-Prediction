justice
antonin
scalia
we've
had
cases
involving
alleged
discrimination
in
state
--
state
contracting,
and
we
haven't
required
the
person
who
was
discriminated
against
because
of
race
to
prove
that
he
would
have
gotten
the
contract
otherwise,
have
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
been
enough
that
there
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
justice
antonin
scalia
her
claim
is
not
necessarily
that
she
would
have
been
--
would
have
been
admitted,
but
that
she
was
denied
a
fair
chance
in
the
admission
lottery.
just
as
when
a
person
is
denied
participation
in
the
contracting
lottery,
he
has
suffered
an
injury.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
done
before
or
after
they
announced
the
decision
to
reinstitute
racial
quotas?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
came
almost
immediately
after
our
decision
on
grutter.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
by
the
way,
do
you
think
that
grutter
--
this
goes
to
justice
breyer's
question
--
do
you
think
that
grutter
held
that
there
is
no
more
affirmative
action
in
higher
education
after
2028?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
the
holding
of
grutter?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
facts
and
there
are
facts,
aren't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that's
a
normal
fact
that
we
accede
to
two-court
holdings
on:
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
critical
mass?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
weird
kind
of
a
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
estimation,
isn't
it?
a
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
don't
you
seriously
suggest
that?
why
don't
you
seriously
suggest
that
demographic
--
that
the
demographic
makeup
of
the
state
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
somebody
feels
isolated,
that
if
you're
in
a
state
that
is
only
1
percent
black
that
doesn't
mean
that
you're
not
isolated
so
long
as
there's
1
percent
in
the
class?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
you
would
take
that
position,
because
it
seems
to
me
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
the
10
percent
plan
is
not
imposed
by
the
university.
it's
not
their
option--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
say
this
--
this
is
not
good
for
education
because
people
will
take
easy
courses.
it's
imposed
by
state
law,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
anybody
who
is
in
the
top
10
percent
of
any
school
in
the
state
gets
into
the
university
of
texas.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
have
to
self-identify?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
do
they
decide?
you
know,
it's
--
they
want
not
just
a
critical
mass
in
the
school
at
large,
but
class
by
class?
how
do
they
figure
out
that
particular
classes
don't
have
enough?
what,
somebody
walks
in
the
room
and
looks
them
over
to
see
who
looks
--
who
looks
asian,
who
looks
black,
who
looks
hispanic?
is
that
how
it's
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
are
talking
about.
i
mean
it
is
either
a
factor
that
is
validly
in
this
case
or
it
isn't.
do
they
look
to
individual
classroom
diversity
or
not?
and
if
so,
how
do
they
decide
when
classes
are
diverse?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
i'm
asking
how.
how
did
they
look
to
the
classroom?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
require
everybody
to
check
a
box
or
they
have
somebody
figure
out,
oh,
this
person
looks
1/32nd
hispanic
and
that's
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
kind
of
a
study?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
doesn't
explain
to
me
how
they
go
about,
classroom
by
classroom,
deciding
how
many
minorities
there
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
why?
why
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
kind
of
viewpoints?
i
mean,
are
they
political
viewpoints?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
racial
diversity.
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
also,
the
kind
that
is
likely
to
be
included
within
the
10
percent
rule.
and,
incidentally,
when
was
the
10
percent
rule
adopted?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
holds
for
only
--
only
another
what,
16
years,
right?
sixteen
more
years,
and
you're
going
to
call
it
all
off.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
appealing
to
grutter,
and
that's
what
it
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
the
stuff
that
grutter
says
--
some
of
the
stuff
that
grutter
says
you
agree
with,
some
of
the
stuff
that
it
says
you
don't
agree
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
part
of
the
injury
she
suffered.
it's
--
it's
not
the
only
injury
perhaps.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
she
--
she
had
to
pay
an
admissions
fee
for
a
process
in
which
she
was
not
treated
fairly.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
she
get
her
money
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
since
we
are
asking
questions
just
about
just
curiosity,
i
am
curious
to
know
how
many
--
this
is
a
very
ambitious
racial
program
here
at
the
university
of
texas.
how
many
people
are
there
in
the
affirmative
action
department
of
the
university
of
texas?
do
you
have
any
idea?
there
must
be
a
lot
of
people
to,
you
know,
to
monitor
all
these
classes
and
do
all
of
this
assessment
of
race
throughout
the
thing.
there
would
be
a
large
number
of
people
be
out
of
a
job,
wouldn't
we,
wouldn't
they,
if
we
suddenly
went
to
just
10
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
--
but
the
hypothetical
is
that
the
two
applicants
are
entirely
the
same
in
all
other
respects.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
--
if
the
ability
to
give
a
racial
preference
means
anything
at
all,
it
certainly
has
to
mean
that,
in
the
--
in
the
hypothetical
given
--
given
by
justice
alito,
the
minority
student
gets
in
and
the
other
one
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
matter
of
not
everyone;
it's
a
matter
of
two
who
are
identical
in
all
other
respects.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
does
the
racial
preference
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
in
that
situation
the
minority
applicant
wins
and
the
other
one
loses?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
should
probably
stop
calling
it
critical
mass
then,
because
mass,
you
know,
assumes
numbers,
either
in
size
or
a
certain
weight.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
should
stop
calling
it
mass.
justice
antonin
scalia
call
it
a
cloud
or
something
like
that.
