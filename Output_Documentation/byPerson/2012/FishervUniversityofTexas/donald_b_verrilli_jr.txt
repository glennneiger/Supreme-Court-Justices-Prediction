mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
resolving
this
case,
it
is
important
to
focus
on
what
is,
or
more
precisely,
what
is
not
at
issue.
petitioner
is
not
challenging
grutter's
reaffirmation
of
the
principle
of
justice
powell's
opinion
in
bakke
that
student
body
diversity
is
a
compelling
interest
that
can
justify
the
consideration
of
race
in
university
admissions.
colleges
and
universities
across
the
country
have
relied
on
that
principle
in
shaping
their
admissions
policies,
and
it
is
of
vital
interest
to
the
united
states
that
they
continue
to
be
able
to
do
so.
the
core
of
our
interest
is
in
ensuring
that
the
nation's
universities
produce
graduates
who
are
going
to
be
effective
citizens
and
effective
leaders
in
an
increasingly
diverse
society,
and
effective
competitors
in
diverse
global
markets.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
understand
that
differently,
justice
alito.
here's
how
we
understand
what
is
going
on
with
respect
to
the
admissions
process
in
the
university
of
texas,
and
i
am
going
to
address
it
directly.
i
just
think
it
needs
a
bit
of
context
to
do
so.
the
top
10
percent
plan
certainly
does
produce
some
ethnic
diversity.
significant
numbers
get
in.
the
problem
is
the
university
can't
control
that
diversity
in
the
same
way
it
can
with
respect
to
the
25
percent
of
the
class
that
is
admitted
through
the
holistic
process.
so
my
understanding
of
what
the
university
here
is
looking
to
do,
and
what
universities
generally
are
looking
to
do
in
this
circumstance,
is
not
to
grant
a
preference
for
privilege,
but
to
make
individualized
decisions
about
applicants
who
will
directly
further
the
educational
mission.
for
example,
they
will
look
for
individuals
who
will
play
against
racial
stereotypes
just
by
what
they
bring:
the
african
american
fencer;
the
hispanic
who
has
--
who
has
mastered
classical
greek.
they
can
also
look
for
people
who
have
a
demonstrated
track
record
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
it's
both.
i
think
the
--
there
is
no
automatic
preference
in
texas.
and
i
think
this
is
right
in
the
--
it
says
at
page
398a
of
the
joint
appendix
--
the
--
they
describe
the
process
as
saying,
"an
applicant's
race
is
considered
only
to
the
extent
that
the
applicant,
viewed
holistically,
will
contribute
to
the
broader
vision
of
diversity
desired
by
the
university.
"
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
but
the
point--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
disagree,
justice
scalia.
what
the
--
texas,
i
think,
has
made
clear
--
and
i
think
this
is
a
common
feature
of
these
kinds
of
holistic
approaches
--
that
not
everyone
in
an
underrepresented
group
gets
a
preference,
gets
a
plus
factor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
there
may
not
be
a
racial
preference
in
that
situation.
it's
going
to
depend
on
a
holistic,
individualized
consideration
of
the
applicant.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
a
tie-breaker.
i
think
it
functions
more
subtly
than
that,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
can
make
a
difference.
it
just
doesn't
invariably
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
every
minority
applicant,
and
that's
the
key--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
make
a
difference
in
the
situation
that
justice
alito
posited--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that
--
that
is
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
point
is
that
it's
not
a
mechanical
factor.
now,
with
respect
to
the
implementation
of
--
and
the
narrow
tailoring
inquiry,
with
respect
to
the
university's
implementation
of
this
--
of
its
compelling
interest,
i
do
think
it's
clear
that,
although
the
petitioner
says
she's
challenging
implementation,
that
this
plan
meets
every
requirement
of
grutter
and
addresses
the
concern
of
justice
kennedy
that
you
raised
in
dissent
in
grutter.
whether
texas
had
to
or
not,
it
did
address
that
concern.
there's
no
quota.
everyone
competes
against
everyone
else.
race
is
not
a
mechanical
automatic
factor.
it's
an
holistic
individualized
consideration.
and
because
of
the
way
the
process
is
structured,
they
do
not
monitor
the
racial
composition
on
an
ongoing
basis.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
correct.
they
make
specific
individualized
judgments
about
each
applicant--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
but
the
key,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
way
it
makes
a
difference.
and
it
makes
a
difference
by
casting
the
accomplishments
of
the
individual
applicant
in
a
particular
light,
or
the
potential
of
an
individual
applicant
in
a
particular
light.
what
--
what
universities
are
looking
for
principally
with
respect
to
this
individualized
consideration
is
what
is
this
individual
going
to
contribute
to
our
campus?
and
race
can
have
a
bearing
on
that
because
it
can
have
a
bearing
on
evaluating
what
they've
accomplished,
and
it
can
have
a
bearing
for
the
reasons
i
tried
to
identify
earlier
to
justice
alito
on
what
they
can
bring
to
the
table,
what
they
can
bring
to
that
freshman
seminar,
what
they
can
bring
to
the
student
government,
what
they
can
bring
to
the
campus
environment--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--not
necessarily.
[laughter]
because
--
because
--
i'm
trying
to
make
a
simple
point
here.
neither--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--neither
might
get
in.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
sure.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
our
--
our
military
effectiveness
depends
on
a
pipeline
of
well-qualified
and
well-prepared
candidates
from
diverse
backgrounds
who
are
comfortable
exercising
leadership
in
diverse
settings.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
right.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
justice
alito.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
point
of
educational
diversity,
the
point
of
what
the
university
of
texas
is
trying
to
achieve
is
to
create
an
environment
in
which
everyone
develops
an
appropriate
sense
of
citizenship,
everyone
develops
the
capacity
to
lead
in
a
racially
diverse
society,
and
so
it
will
benefit
every
rotc
applicant
from
the
university
of
texas.
and
43
percent
of
the
officer
corps
comes
from
the
rotc.
it's
a
very
significant
source
of
our
military
leadership.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
critical
--
i
agree
with
my
friend
that
critical
mass
is
not
a
number.
i
think
it
would
be
very
ill-advised
to
suggest
that
it
is
numerical.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
may
i
answer,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you.
i
think
--
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
court
simply
affords
complete
deference
to
the
university's
judgment
that
it
hasn't
yet
achieved
the
level
of
diversity
that
it
needs
to
accomplish
its
educational
mission.
i
think
that
the
court
ought
to
--
has
to
make
its
own
independent
judgment.
i
think
the
way
the
court
would
go
about
making
that
independent
judgment
is
to
look
at
the
kind
of
information
that
the
university
considered.
that
could
be
information
about
the
composition
of
the
class.
it
could
be
information
about
classroom
diversity.
it
could
be
information
about
retention
and
graduation
rates.
it
could
be
information
about
--
that's
specific
to
the
university's
context
in
history.
is
it
a
university
that
has
had
a
history
of
racial
incidents
and
trouble
or
not?
a
series
of
factors.
and
then
what
the
court's
got
to
do
is
satisfy
itself
that
the
university
has
substantiated
its
conclusion
based
on
that
--
based
on
the
information
it's
considered,
that
it
needs
to
consider
race
to
further
advance
the
educational
goals
that
grutter
has
identified
as
a
compelling
interest.
and
i
will
say,
i
do
think,
as
the
number
of
minority
enrollees
gets
higher,
the
burden
on
the
university
to
do
that
is
going
to
get
harder
to
meet.
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
there
is
a
number,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
prudent
for
this
court
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
number,
because
it
would
raise
exactly
the
kind
of
problem
that
i
--
that
i
think
justice
kennedy
identified
in
the
grutter
dissent
of
creating
hydraulic
pressure
towards
that
number.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
agree
that
critical
mass
--
the
idea
of
critical
mass
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
in
a
way
that's
not
helpful
because
it
doesn't
focus
the
inquiry
where
it
should
be.
if
i
may
just
add
one
word
in
conclusion.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you.
i
think
it
is
important,
your
honors,
not
just
to
the
government,
but
to
the
country,
that
our
universities
have
the
flexibility
to
shape
their
environments
and
their
educational
experience
to
make
a
reality
of
the
principle
that
justice
kennedy
identified
in
parents
involved,
that
our
strength
comes
from
people
of
different
races,
different
creeds,
different
cultures,
uniting
in
a
commitment
to
freedom,
and
to
more
a
perfect
union.
that's
what
the
university
of
texas
is
trying
to
do
with
its
admissions
policy,
and
it
should
be
upheld.
