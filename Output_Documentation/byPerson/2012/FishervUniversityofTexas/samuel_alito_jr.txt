justice

alito,

mr.
rein,
do
you
understand
what
the
university
of
texas
thinks
is
the
definition
of
a
critical
mass?
because
i
don't.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
on
the
classroom
diversity,
how
does
the
non-top
10
percent
part
of
the
plan
further
classroom
diversity?
my
understanding
is
that
the
university
had
over
5,000
classes
that
qualified
as
small
and
the
total
number
of
african
americans
and
hispanics
who
were
admitted
under
the
part
of
the
plan
that
is
challenged
was
just
a
little
over
200.
so
how
does
that
--
how
does
that
--
how
can
that
possibly
do
more
than
a
tiny,
tiny
amount
to
increase
classroom
diversity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
per
class?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
individuals
in
class.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
many
--
how
many
non-top
10
percent
members
of
the
two
minorities
at
issue
here
are
admitted
in
each
class?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
really
don't
understand
your
answer.
you
know
the
total
number
of,
let's
say,
african
americans
in
an
entering
class,
right?
yes
or
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
know
the
total
number
who
were
admitted
under
the
top
10
percent
plan?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
subtract
a
from
b
you'll
get
c,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
is
the
value
of
c
per
class?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
critical
mass
vary
from
group
to
group?
does
it
vary
from
state
to
state?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
could
you
answer
my
question?
what
does
the
university
of
texas
--
the
university
of
texas
think
about
those
questions?
is
the
critical
mass
for
the
university
of
texas
dependent
on
the
breakdown
of
the
population
of
texas?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
the
whole
purpose
of
affirmative
action
was
to
help
students
who
come
from
underprivileged
backgrounds,
but
you
make
a
very
different
argument
that
i
don't
think
i've
ever
seen
before.
the
top
10
percent
plan
admits
lots
of
african
americans
--
lots
of
hispanics
and
a
fair
number
of
african
americans.
but
you
say,
well,
it's
--
it's
faulty,
because
it
doesn't
admit
enough
african
americans
and
hispanics
who
come
from
privileged
backgrounds.
and
you
specifically
have
the
example
of
the
child
of
successful
professionals
in
dallas.
now,
that's
your
argument?
if
you
have
--
you
have
an
applicant
whose
parents
are
--
let's
say
they're
--
one
of
them
is
a
partner
in
your
law
firm
in
texas,
another
one
is
a
part
--
is
another
corporate
lawyer.
they
have
income
that
puts
them
in
the
top
1
percent
of
earners
in
the
country,
and
they
have
--
parents
both
have
graduate
degrees.
they
deserve
a
leg-up
against,
let's
say,
an
asian
or
a
white
applicant
whose
parents
are
absolutely
average
in
terms
of
education
and
income?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
can
the
answer
to
that
question
be
no,
because
being
an
african
american
or
being
a
hispanic
is
a
plus
factor.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
would
3
percent
be
enough
in
new
mexico,
your
bordering
state,
where
the
african
american
population
is
around
2
percent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
in
terms
of
diversity,
how
do
you
justify
lumping
together
all
asian
americans?
do
you
think
--
do
you
have
a
critical
mass
of
filipino
americans?
cambodian
americans--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--cambodian
americans?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
do
you
have
a
critical
mass
as
to
all
the
subgroups
that
fall
within
this
enormous
group
of
asian
americans?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
the
united
states
agree
with
mr.
garre
that
african
american
and
hispanic
applicants
from
privileged
backgrounds
deserve
a
preference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
have
two
applicants
who
are
absolutely
the
same
in
every
respect:
they
both
come
from
affluent
backgrounds,
well-educated
parents.
one
falls
within
two
of
the
groups
that
are
given
a
preference,
the
other
doesn't.
it's
a
marginal
case.
it's
the
last
--
the
last
position
available
in
the
class.
under
the
texas
plan,
one
gets
in;
one
doesn't
get
in.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
agree
with
--
do
you
agree
that
that
is
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
facts,
or
do
you
agree
that
that's
an
incorrect
understanding
of
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
withdraw
that
hypothetical
if
you
don't
like
that.
before
your
time
runs
out,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
your
rotc
argument
--
you
make
--
you
make
--
you
devote
a
lot
of
attention
in
your
brief
to
the
military.
could
you
explain
your
rotc
argument
to
me?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
important
for
the
rotc
program
for
commissioned
officers
that
texas
have
this
other
plan
on
top
of
the
top
10
percent
plan?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
oh,
i
understand
that.
and
just
--
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off,
but--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--because
the
time
is
about
to
expire,
so
you've
got
a
marginal
candidate
who
wants
to
go
to
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
and
is
also
interested
in
rotc.
maybe
if
race
is
taken
into
account,
the
candidate
gets
in.
maybe
if
it
isn't,
he
doesn't
get
in.
how
does
that
impact
the
military?
the
candidate
will
then
probably
go
to
texas
a&m
or
texas
tech?
is
it
your
position
that
he
will
be
an
inferior
military
officer
if
he
went
to
one
of
those
schools?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
i
don't
understand
the
argument.
