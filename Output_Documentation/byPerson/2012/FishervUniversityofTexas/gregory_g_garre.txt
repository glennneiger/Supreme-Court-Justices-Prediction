mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
two
overriding
reasons,
the
admissions
plan
before
you
is
constitutional
under
this
court's
precedents.
first,
it
is
indistinguishable
in
terms
of
how
it
operates
in
taking
race
into
account
as
only
one
modest
factor
among
many
for
the
individualized
considerations
of
applicants
in
their
totality
from
plans
that
this
court
has
upheld
in
grutter
and
plans
that
this
court
approved
in
bakke
and
the
harvard
plan.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right,
and
so
that's
the
second
point
i
was
going
to
make,
which
is
that
the
holistic
admissions
process
at
issue
here
is
a
necessary
counterpart
to
the
state's
top
10
percent
law
and
works
to
systematic
--
to
offset
the
systematic
drawbacks
of
that
law
in
achieving
an
interest
that
is
indisputably
compelling,
the
university's
interest
of
assembling
a
broadly
diverse
student
body.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
there
is
a
multiracial
box.
students
check
boxes
based
on
their
own
determination.
this
is
true
under
the
common
application--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--then
they
would
check
that
box,
your
honor,
as
is
true--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
that
was
--
they
would
make
that
self-determination,
your
honor.
if
anyone,
in
any
part
of
the
application,
violated
some
honor
code
then
that
could
come
out--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it
would,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
that
issue
would
be
any
different
than
the
plan
upheld
in
grutter
or
the
harvard
plan
or
in
bakke.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
do
not,
your
honor,
and
no
college
in
america,
the
ivy
leagues,
the
little
ivy
leagues,
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
the
same
way
that
that
determination
is
made
in
any
other
situation
i'm
aware
of
where
race
is
taken
into
account.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
persons
self-identify
on
that
form.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
they
do
not,
your
honor.
every
year
people
do
not
and
many
of
those
applicants
are
admitted.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
your
honor,
and
let
me
try
to
be
clear
on
this.
the
university
has
never
asserted
a
compelling
interest
in
any
specific
diversity
in
every
single
classroom.
it
has
simply
looked
to
classroom
diversity
as
one
dimension
of
student
body
diversity.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
this
court
in
grutter,
your
honor,
and
maybe
the
most
important
thing
that
was
said
during
the
first
30
minutes
was,
when
given
an
opportunity
to
challenge
grutter,
i
understood
my
friend
not
to
ask
this
court
to
overrule
it.
this
court
in
grutter
recognized
the
obvious
fact
that
the
classroom
is
one
of
the
most
important
environments
where
the
educational
benefits
of
diversity
are
realized,
and
so
the
university
of
texas,
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
had
reached
a
critical
mass,
looked
to
the
classroom
along
with--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
did
a
study,
your
honor,
that
took
into
account
the
same
considerations
that
they
did
in
discussing
the
enrollment
categories--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
it's
in
the
supplemental
joint
appendix.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
there
are
student
lists
in
each
classroom.
the
student
lists--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
no,
your
honor.
of
course,
each
classroom,
the
university
knows
which
students
are
taking
its
classes
and
one
can
then,
if
you
want
to
gauge
diversity
in
the
classrooms,
go
back--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
this
was
part
of
a--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--that
is
information
that
is
available
to
the
university,
your
honor,
the
race
of
students
if
they've
checked
it
on
the
application.
but
i
do
want
to
be
clear
on
this
classroom
diversity
study.
this
was
only
one
of
many
information
points
that
the
university
looked
to.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor,
first
i
think
that
200
number
is
erroneous.
there
have
been
many
more
minority
candidates--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
not
--
not
on
a
per-class
basis.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
in
looking
at
the
classrooms,
your
honor,
what
the
university
found
was
shocking
isolation.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
we
didn't
look
specifically
at
that
determination.
what
we
did
--
in
other
words,
to
try
to
find
whether
there
were
holistic
admits
or
percentage
admits,
we
did
conclude
in
2004
--
and
again
this
was
before
--
we
did
the
classroom
study
before
the
plan
at
issue
was
adopted
and
at
that
time
there
were
no
holistic
admits
taking
race
into
account.
and
what
we
concluded
was
that
we
simply
--
if
you
looked
at
african
americans,
for
example,
in
90
percent
of
the
classes
of
the
most
common
participatory
size--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
we
do,
your
honor.
but
again
at
the
time--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
at
the
time--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why
the
university
didn't
look
specifically
to
that.
because
at
the
time
that
the
classroom
diversity
study
was
conducted,
it
was
before
the
holistic
admissions
process
at
issue
here
was
adopted
in
2003-2004.
and
so
that
determination
wouldn't
have
been
as
important
as
just
finding
out
are
african
americans
or
hispanics,
underrepresented
minorities,
present
at
the
university
in
such
numbers
that
we
are
not
experiencing
racial
isolation
in
the
classroom.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
we
don't
have
one.
and
this
court
in
grutter--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--to
look
to
the
same
criteria
of
this
court
in
grutter.
this
court
in
grutter
specifically
rejected
the
notion
that
you
could
come
up
with
a
fixed
percentage.
now--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
certainly
is
contextual.
i
think
it
could
vary,
your
honor.
i
think
--
let
me
first
say
that
my
friends
have,
throughout
this
litigation,
not
in
this
court,
asserted
20
percent
as
a
critical
mass
and
that's
lumping
together
different
minority
groups.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
it's
not
at
all.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it's
not
at
all.
it's
looking
to
the
educational
benefits
of
diversity
on
campus,
and
i
think
we
actually
agree
on
what
that
means
and
what
grutter
said
it
meant
in
terms
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--let
me
make
a
couple
of
points,
your
honor.
first,
if
you
just
looked
at
the
numbers
--
we
don't
think
it's
the
numbers,
but
if
you
looked
at
the
numbers
after
7
years,
racial
diversity
among
these
groups
at
the
university
of
texas
had
remained
stagnant
or
worse.
2002,
african
american
enrollment
had
actually
dropped
to
3
percent.
that's
one
part
of
it.
the
other
part
of
it
is
if
you
look
at
the
admissions
under
the
top
10
percent
plan,
taking
the
top
10
percent
of
a
racially
identifiable
high
school
may
get
you
diversity
that
looks
okay
on
paper,
but
it
doesn't
guarantee
you
diversity
that
produces
educational
benefits
on
campus.
and
that's
one
of
the
considerations
that
the
university
took
into
account
as
well.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
because,
your
honor,
as
is
true
for
any
group,
and
the
harvard
plan
that
this
court
approved
in
bakke
specifically
recognized
this,
you
would
want
representatives
and
different
viewpoints
from
individuals
within
the
same
--
the
same
racial
group,
just
as
you
would
from
individuals
outside
of
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
anyone's
experiences,
where
they
grew
up,
the
situations
that
they
--
that
they
experience
in
their
lives
are
going
to
affect
their
viewpoints.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
think
it
directly
impacts
the
educational
benefits
of
diversity
in
this
sense,
that
the
minority
candidate
who
has
shown
that
--
that
he
or
she
has
succeeded
in
an
integrated
environment,
has
shown
leadership,
community
service,
the
other
factors
that
we
looked
at
in
holistic
review,
is
precisely
the
kind
of
candidate
that's
going
to
come
--
come
on
campus,
help
to
break
down
racial
barriers,
work
across
racial
lines,
dispel
--
stereotypes--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--1998,
your
honor.
but
with
respect
to
your
factual
point,
that's
absolutely
wrong,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
the
admissions
data
that
we
cite
on
page
34
of
our
brief,
it
shows
the
breakdown
of
applicants
under
the
holistic
plan
and
the
percentage
plan.
and
i
don't
think
it's
been
seriously
disputed
in
this
case
to
this
point
that,
although
the
percentage
plan
certainly
helps
with
minority
admissions,
by
and
large,
the
--
the
minorities
who
are
admitted
tend
to
come
from
segregated,
racially-identifiable
schools.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
your
honor.
and
let
me
--
let
me
answer
the
question.
first
of
all,
the
example
comes
almost
word
for
word
from
the
harvard
plan
that
this
court
approved
in
grutter
and
that
justice
powell
held
out
in
bakke.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
because,
your
honor,
our
point
is,
is
that
we
want
minorities
from
different
backgrounds.
we
go
out
of
our
way
to
recruit
minorities
from
disadvantaged
backgrounds.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no,
your
honor,
what
counts
is
different
experiences--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
what
we
want
is
different
experiences
that
are
going
to
--
that
are
going
to
come
on
campus--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
your
honors,
it's
--
it's
not
race.
it's
just
the
opposite.
i
mean,
in
the
luac
decision,
for
example,
this
court
said
that
failing
to
take
into
account
differences
among
members
of
the
same
race
does
a
disservice--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it's
--
it's
members
of
the
same
racial
group,
your
honor,
bringing
different
experiences.
and
to
say
that
--
if
you
took
any
racial
group,
if
you
had
an
admissions
process
that
only
tended
to
admit
from
a
--
people
from
a
particular
background
or
perspective,
you
would
want
people
from
different
perspectives.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
that's
--
that's
the
interests
that
we're
discussing
here.
it's
the
interests
that
the
harvard
plan
specifically
adopts
and
lays
out--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
what
--
what
this
court's
precedents
say
is
a
critical
mass
is
an
environment
in
which
students
of
underrepresented--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
this
question,
of
course,
implicates
grutter
itself.
and,
again,
i
understood
my
friend
not
to
challenge
that.
they
haven't
challenged
that
diversity
is
a
compelling
interest
at
all.
what
--
what
we
look
to,
and
we
think
that
courts
can
review
this
determination,
one,
we
look
to
feedback
directly
from
students
about
racial
isolation
that
they
experience.
do
they
feel
like
spokespersons
for
their
race.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
one
of
the
things
we
looked
at.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
we
looked
at.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
another
is
that
we
did
look
to
enrollment
data,
which
showed,
for
example,
among
african
americans,
that
african
american
enrollment
at
the
university
of
texas
dropped
to
3
percent
in
2002
under
the
percentage
plan.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
we
all
agree
that
3
percent
is
not
a
critical
mass.
it's
well
beyond
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
when
we
have
an
environment
in
which
african
americans
do
not--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
part
of
this
is
a
--
is
a
judgment
that
the
admin
--
the
educators
are
going
to
make,
but
you
would
look
to
the
same
criteria--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
you
would
look
to
the
criteria
that
we
looked
at,
the
enrollment
data,
the
feedback
from
the
students.
we
also
took
into
account
diversity
in
the
classroom.
we
took
into
account
the
racial
climate
on
campus.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
would.
i
mean,
our
concept
to
critical
mass
isn't
tied
to
demographic.
it's
undisputed
in
this
case
that
we
are
not
pursuing
any
demographic
goal.
that's
on
page
138
of
the
joint
appendix.
all
of
--
i
think
many
key
facts
are
undisputed
here.
it's
undisputed
that
race
is
only
a
modest
factor.
it's
undisputed
that
we're
taking
race
into
account
only
to
consider
individuals
in
their
totality.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
the
standard
you
would
apply
is
the
one
set
forth
in
grutter,
and
it
comes
from
justice
powell's
opinion
in
bakke,
that
you
would
look
to
whether
or
not
the
university
reached
an
environment
in
which
members
of
underrepresented
minorities,
african
americans
and
hispanics,
do
not
feel
like
spokespersons
for
their
race,
members
--
an
environment
where
cross-racial
understanding
is
promoted,
an
environment
where
the
benefit
--
educational
benefits
of
diversity
are
realized.
and
the
reason
why
the
university
of
texas
concluded
that
that
environment
was
not
met
here,
it
laid
out
in
several
different
information
points
that
this
court
can
review--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
we
don't
read
grutter
as
establishing
that
kind
of
time
clock.
we
are
looking
at
this--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
grutter
is
this
court's
precedence.
we're
guided
by
it
here.
at
least
the
advocates
are.
and
--
and
what
we
would
look
to
is
once
--
we're
looking
at
this
every
year,
we're
looking
at
it
carefully.
and
once
we
reach
that
point,
of
course,
we're
going
to
stop.
but
we
also
take--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
don't
know
that
i've
disagreed
with
anything
it
said.
it--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--first
i'd
point
to
my
friend's
own
concessions,
that
the
consideration
of
race
has
increased
racial
diversity
at
hispanic
and
helps
with
minority
enrollment.
that's
on
page
138
of
the
joint
appendix.
secondly,
i'd
point
to
the
fact
that
african
american
and
hispanics'
admissions
did
increase.
african
american
admissions
doubled
from
the
period
of
2002
to
2004.
so
this
has
had
a
real
important
impact
on
diversity
at
the
university
of
texas.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--the
common
form
that's
used
has
asian
american,
but
also,
next
to
that,
has
a
form
that
says
country
of
origin
where
that
can
be
spelled
out.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
we've
looked
to
whether
or
not
we
have
a
critical
mass
of
underrepresented
minorities,
which
is
precisely
what
the
grutter
decision
asks
us
to
do.
i
think
--
if
i
can
make
a
quick
point
on
jurisdiction--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
no.
no,
your
honor,
and
we
don't.
on
page
389--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
--
we
wouldn't
be
monitoring
the
class.
i
think
one
of
the
problems--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--it
did,
your
honor.
it
was
one
of
the
things--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
your
honor.
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
you
pointed
out
in
your
dissent.
what
i'm
saying
is
we
don't
have
that
problem,
because--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
so,
because
the
grutter
majority
didn't
understand
it
to
be
monitoring
for
the
purposes
of
reaching
a
specific
demographic.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
all
the
holistic
factors
are
taking
into
account
on
the
application,
and
they're
listed
at
various
points
on
the
application.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
--
that
is
true
on
the
cover
of
the
application.
if
--
could
i
make
one
point
on
jurisdiction?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
the
fundamental
problem
with
jurisdiction
is
this:
first
of
all,
they
definitively
cannot
show
that
she
was
injured
by
any
consideration
of
race.
that's
at
pages
415
and
416
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
it
makes
clear
that
ms.
fisher
would
not
have
been
admitted
to
the
fall
2008
class
at
university
of
texas
no
matter
what
her
race,
because
her--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
there
is
another
part
of
that
that
comes
from
the
brief
in
opposition,
your
honor,
which
goes
to
the
relief
that
she
has
requested.
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
release
--
relief
that
this
case
began
with,
that
request
has
fallen
out,
and
that's
undisputed.
so
the
only
thing
that
is
live
in
this
case
is
a
request
for
monetary
damages.
that
request
is
on
page
79
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
it's
focused
exclusively
on
a
request
for
the
return
of
admissions
fees.
and
the
reason
why
that
is
not
enough
to
confer
standing
is
that
she
would
have
paid
the
admissions
fee
no
matter
what
policy
the
university
admissions
had.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
texas
v.
lesage
says
that
that
--
that
injury
is
not
sufficient
in
a
backward-looking
case
like
this,
where
you
only
have
monetary
damages.
in
jacksonville
and
all
the
other
cases,
they
involved
forward-looking
claims
for
declaratory
injunctive
release
where
people
who
were
going
to
go
out
and
get
contracts
again.
so
texas
university--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
that
is
not
an
answer
to
jurisdiction
for
this
reason:
it's
true
that
it
is
bifurcated
in
the
sense
that
we
could
go
and
prove
damages,
but
the
complaint
makes
no
doubt
that
the
only
request
for
monetary
damages
is
a
request
for
admissions
fees.
that
--
it
says
that
explicitly.
and
this
court
has
said
that
relief
that
does
not
remedy
the
injury
suffered
cannot
bootstrap
a
plaintiff
into
federal
court.
that
is
the
very
essence
of
the
redressability
requirement.
that
comes
from
the
seal
co.
case.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
the
reason
why--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
i
don't
have
specific
numbers.
obviously,
the
ivy
leagues
and
little
ivy
leagues
that
have
filed
amicus
briefs
are
using
it.
and
this
court
recognized
in
grutter
that
the
best
universities,
many
of
the
best
universities
in
america,
have
been
using
these
plans
for
30
years
or
more.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
one
of
the
things
that
the
university
of
texas
does
monitor
is
the
racial
climate
on
campus.
it
does
that
to
improve
the
experience
for
all
students
on
campus.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
don't--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--have
a
specific
number
of
people,
your
honor,
but
it
is
--
it
is
an
important
part
of
improving
the
educational
experience
for
all
students
at
the
university
of
texas
no
matter
what
their
race.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
your
honor.
