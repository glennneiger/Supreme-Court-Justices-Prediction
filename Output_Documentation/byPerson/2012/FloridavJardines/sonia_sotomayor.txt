justice

so
doesn't
that
mean
that
what's
in
your
home
that's
not
visible
to
the
public
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
--
that
is
circular.
then
why
do
you
need
a
search
warrant?
if
you
have
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contraband,
why
bother
even
with
a
search
warrant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
is
that
an
implied
consent?
that's
a
huge
assumption.
at
least
in
the
cities
that
i've
lived
in,
you
have
to
have
a
dog
on
a
leash.
and
you
don't
give
implied
consent.
if
you're
allergic
to
animals,
you
don't
want
dogs
walking
around
at
your
door.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
but
tell
me
why
that
you
presume
that
there's
implied
consent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
homeowners
freely
let
dogs
just
come
into
their
apartment?
i
mean,
there
might
be
some
homes
that
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we're
going
to
treat
it
like
a
human
being
now?
you're
invited
to
knock
on
my
door
because
you're
a
dog?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
now
we
tell--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--all
the
drug
dealers,
put
up
a
sign
that
says
“
no
dogs
”.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
it
fair
just
to
assume
that
--
what's
logical?
i
--
i
let
people
knock
on
my
door
because
they
have
to
say
something
to
me.
i
don't
let
a
dog
come
up
to
my
door
--
i
don't
willy-nilly
invite
it
to
come
up
to
my
door.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
implied
consent,
does
that
include
them
coming
up
and
--
up
to
your
porch
and
sweeping
stuff
into
a
garbage
pan?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
garre,
there's
no
dispute
that
dogs
can
smell
what
human
beings
can't;
is
that
correct?
it's
not
that
we
can
find
a
machine
to
put
it
on
a
human
being
to
enhance
their
sense
of
smells;
dogs
can
do
something
human
beings
can't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
have
to
treat
him
like
a
guy,
to
think
that
he
is
not
like
technology
in
terms
of
augmenting
what
a
human
being
can
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he's
not
augmenting
what
a
human
being
can
do.
he's
substituting
what
a
human
being
can
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
we
go
back
to
the
concession
that
was
asked
of
you,
what
you
conceded
in
the
florida
court
or
didn't?
have
you
conceded
that
the
police
officer
sans
dog,
if
he
had
come
up
to
the
door
and
knocked,
that
that
would
have
been
permissible,
that
that
was
not
a
search
or
seizure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
he
have
--
did
he
have
a
right
under
the
facts
of
this
case?
he
had
been
told
that
in
this
house
they
were
growing
marijuana
by
a
confidential
informant.
assume
that's
all
that
he
had.
would
he
have
had
a
right
to
walk
up
to
the
door,
knock
on
it,
and
start
asking
questions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
--
sans
dog,
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
you
are
conceding
that
he
had
license
to
walk
onto
--
or
walk
to
the
door
and
ask
questions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
the
bottom
line
is
that
are
you
taking
--
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
saying
there's
no
implied
consent
to
bring
a
dog
on
to
my
property.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
mr.
garre
said
differently,
that
there
is
an
implied
consent
for
your
neighbor
to
bring
the
dog
up
for
anyone
else
but
a
police
officer.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
there's
an
implied
consent
for
anyone
else
or
there
is
no
implied
consent,
period?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
on
a
really
slippery
slope
with
that
answer.
there's
dual
motives
in
everything
police
officers
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
knock
to
hope
the
person
comes
to
the
door
and
that
they
can
see
something
from
the
door.
they
knock
--
they
always
have
a
dual
motive.
so
you're
suggesting
what.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
terms
of
our
rule--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--he
knocks,
and
he
says
to
the
neighbor,
who
are
you?
i've
gotten
a
report,
and
i'm
smelling
drugs,
so
i
know
you
have
drugs
in
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
if
he
smells
first
and
asks
the
question
second,
that's
not
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
what
the
dog
does,
according
to
the
police
officer's
testimony,
is
he
gave
him
a
long
leash
so
the
dog
would
lead
him
to
the
drugs.
and
what
the
dog
did,
i
thought,
according
to
what
i
read,
was
go
past
the
motorcycle
to
make
sure
--
i
mean,
the
officer
said
this
--
you
don't
know
if
the
drugs
are
in
the
motorcycle,
you
don't
know
if
they're
in
the
garage,
you
don't
know
where
they
might
be.
so
the
dog
is
permitted
to
roam
around
until
he
catches
the
scent.
is
that
accurate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
point
is
that
he's
sniffing
all
the
way
around
the
scene.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
