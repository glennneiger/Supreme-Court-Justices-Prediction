ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
go
right
to
two
points
that
respond
to
the
court's
questions.
the
first
is
the
question
of
whether
the
officer
and
the
dog
were
lawfully
in
place,
whether
they
could
approach
the
front
door,
was
conceded
below.
and,
as
the
court
--
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
that
is
not
an
issue
before
the
court.
and
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
court
has--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
let
me
give
the
court
specific
citations
on
that.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
florida
court
of
appeals,
found
that
the
dog
and
the
officer
were
lawfully
in
place.
that's
ja
pages
104,
105,
112,
116
and
120.
before
the
florida
supreme
court
at
oral
argument,
respondent
conceded
that
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
porch,
and
the
florida
supreme
court
accepted
that
concession.
that's
petition
appendix
page
31,
also
noted
by
the
dissent
in
pages
78
to
79.
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
cert,
respondent
said
that
the
police
could
approach
the
front
door
for
a
knock
and
talk,
and
made
no
separate
argument
about
the
dog's
presence
there
making
it
not
lawful.
so
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
it
is
with
the
dog
and
the
officer
lawfully
in
place
at
the
front
door,
approaching
the
front
door
just
like
any
girl
scout,
trick-or-treater,
or
anyone
else
could.
and
just
to
respond,
justice
ginsburg,
to
the
questions
that
you
raised,
the
police
officer's
purpose
in
approaching
the
front
door
does
not
mean
that
the
officer
can't
come
to
the
door.
the
court
has
said
in
many
contexts
that
officer
purpose
doesn't
matter,
and
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
officer
is
looking
for
a
lost
child
or
thinking
that
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
assuming
that
the
police
can
lawfully
be
in
the
place
that
they
are
going
with
the
dog,
which
is
conceded
here--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--if
they
are
approaching
the
front
door
using
the
normal
path,
because
the
dog
only
detects
contraband,
yes,
they
could
be
used
in
those
circumstances,
but
that's
not
happening.
there
have
been
justices
who've
warned
about
that--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there
are
justices
that
have
warned
about
this
for
over
30
years,
and
these
problems
have
not
come
to
fruition.
there
are
restraints
on
police
resources.
there's
the
potential
for
community
hostility.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
have
arose
in
the
courts
of
appeal--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--but
in
caballes,
where
admittedly
the
court
did
not
decide
this
specific
issue,
it
distinguished
the
case
of
kyllo
as
saying
that
that
was
finding
out
about
lawful
activity
in
the
home,
and
that
a
person
--
the
critical
distinction
between
kyllo
and
the
dog
sniff
in
caballes
is
that
a
person
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
contraband.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
i
wanted
to
be
sure
to
respond
to
that,
justice
kennedy,
because
i
would
hate
for
the
court
to
have
the
impression
that
all
the
rules
go
out
the
window.
that's
not
the
case.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
sniff
that
would
allow
the
police
to
go
to
a
detached
and
neutral
magistrate
to
say
that,
we
have
probable
cause--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--to
get
a
warrant.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
the
reasoning
in
contraband
--
in
jacobsen,
though,
the
court
said
that
the
rationale,
the
reason
for
its
decision
in
place,
is
because
when
you're
talking
about
people's
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy,
they
have
both
a
subjective
and
an
objective
component.
so
it's
not
just
that
you
want
to
keep
something
private;
it's
that
you
need
to
have
a
legitimate
expectation
that
you
can
keep
that
private.
and
the
court
has
said
over
and
over,
in
place,
in
caballes,
in
jacobsen,
that
you
do
not
have
a
legitimate
expectation
with
respect
to
contraband.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--what
we're
trying
to
say,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
that
you
lack
any
privacy
expectation
in
the
home.
that's
why
you
need
to
get
a
warrant
before
going
into
the
home.
all
the
dog
sniff
allows
is
for
the
police
to
try
to
go
to
a
magistrate
and
establish
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i
think
that
my
answer
touches
on
the
point
that
you
made,
which
is
it
was
not
contraband.
the
police
thought
that
it
might
be
evidence
of
a
crime,
but
the
court
did
not
say
it
was
contraband.
and,
actually,
there
was
a
discussion
at
the
oral
argument,
where
defense
counsel
made
very
clear
that
ether
has
many
lawful
uses.
that
makes
it
different
from
what
the
court
considered
in
place.
this
came
after
the
court's
decision
in
place.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
the
defense
counsel
i
think
correctly
suggested
in
the
karo
oral
argument
that,
in
fact,
there
are
lawful
uses
in
photography
labs
in
houses
and
the
like.
he
actually
had
an
expert
that
came
to
the
suppression
hearing
in
that
case
and
testified
about
the
various
lawful
uses
of
ether
in
a
house.
so
i
think,
as
the
argument
came
to
the
court,
the
government
was
not
making
an
argument
that
that
was
contraband
or
evidence
of
a
crime.
the
government
was
just
saying,
oh,
it's
very
limited
information,
because
we
had
already
--
we
had
already
tracked
the
ether
to
the
house,
so
you
weren't
finding
out
much.
and
the
court
said
basically
what
it
said
in
kyllo,
which
is,
it
might
not
be
much,
but
it's
still
about
lawful
information,
activity
in
the
house,
and
that's
protected.
but
in
caballes,
the
court
came
back
and
said,
sure,
we've
said
kyllo,
lawful
activity
in
the
house,
but
your
interests
in
protecting
contraband
are
different;
those
are
not
legitimate
interests.
and
the
court
has
said
that
again
and
again
and
again.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
with
respect,
when
we
look
at
the
--
when
we
look
at
the
language
in
these
cases,
in
caballes
and
the
like,
you
know,
the
court
wasn't
saying,
oh,
it's
not
a
search
because
this
has
already
--
this
had
already
been
seized
and
nothing
more
was
happening.
the
court
said
it
was
not
a
search
because
there
is
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
and
just
to
be
clear,
the
question
about
whether
folks
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
contraband
in
their
house
has
to
take
into
account
two
facts:
first,
that
we're
only
talking
about
contraband;
but,
also,
that
dogs
have
been
used
and
known
for
centuries
for
their
sense
of
smell.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
this
sniff
occurred
very
quickly,
and
it--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
i
think
the
5
to
10
minutes,
like
counsel
said,
was
the
whole
process
of
--
of
bringing
the
dog
up
to
the
door,
et
cetera.
the
sniff
happened
very
quickly.
but
putting
that
to
the
side,
what
the
dog
is
doing
is
sniffing
things
that
have
been
exposed
to
the
public
from
inside
the
house,
smells
that
the
officer
himself
could
smell,
could
smell
in
--
in
plain
smell.
and
the
court
has
said
in
other
cases,
like
in
place,
that
what
the
dog
is
doing
is
very
limited
in
scope;
it
happens
very
quickly;
there
is
no
physical
invasion;
it's
something
that
actually
this
court
has
said
in
florida
v.
royer
is
something
that
we
want
officers
to
do,
because
it--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
5
to
10
minutes
as
i
read
the
record
was
the
whole
process.
the
--
the
dog
sniff
i
think
took
seconds
or
maybe
a
minute
or
2
minutes--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that
they
were
--
that
they
met
at
the
front
gate,
that
they
were
walking
up
to
the
--
to
the
door,
that
the
dog
did
the
sniff,
that
the
--
that
he
talked
to
the
other
officer,
and
then
he
went
back
to
his
car,
which
was
parked
i
think
some
--
some
length
of
time
away.
so--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
the
dog
sniffs.
he
has
to
find
the
strongest
source
of
the
odor.
so
he
starts
sniffing
right
away.
he
sniffs
around
for
a
few
seconds;
he
finds
the
strongest
source
of
the
odor
and
he
sits
down
at
that
place.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
i
think
the
--
probably
the
cites
that
--
that
justice
breyer
gave
are
the
cites
that
describe
it.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
something
more
specific
than
that.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
thank
you.
