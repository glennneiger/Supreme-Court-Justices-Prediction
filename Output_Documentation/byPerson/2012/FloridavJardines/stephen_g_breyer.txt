justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
if
you're
looking
at
expectation
of
a
reasonable
homeowner,
imagine
you
have
a
home,
a
long
driveway.
you
do
expect
people
to
come
up
and
come
into
the
house,
knock
on
the
door,
maybe
even
with
dogs.
do
you
expect
them
to
sit
there
for
5
to
15
minutes,
15
minutes,
not
knocking
on
the
door,
doing
nothing?
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
that
something
i
wouldn't
--
would
you
be
nervous
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anyone
coming
to
your
door
and
not
knocking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
sniffing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
there
is
in
this
sense.
justice
scalia
just
said
it.
he
said,
you
do
have
an
expectation
of
people
coming
into
your
door,
perhaps
even
with
animals,
perhaps
even
with
binoculars,
but
not
looking
into
the
house,
not
looking
into
the
house
from
the
front
step
with
the
binoculars.
now,
why
is
that
unconstitutional?
because
it's
very
unusual
that
someone
would
do
that,
and
the
homeowner
would
resent
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
a
homeowner
resent
someone
coming
with
a
large
animal
sitting
in
front
of
his
front
step
on
his
property
and
sitting
there
sniffing
for
5
to
15
minutes?
forget
the
sniffing.
just
talking,
loud
noises.
is
that
something
that
you
invite
people
to
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
is
that
what
happened
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
what
happened
here
was
5
to
15
minutes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
--
what
i'm
curious
about,
and
it's
an
unanswered
question
for
me,
is
we
are
considering
whether
the
dog
sniff
is
permissible,
so
i
wanted
to
know
what
a
dog
sniff
at
the
front
door
involved.
and
at
page
96,
97,
98
of
the
joint
appendix,
with
which
you
are
familiar,
it
explains
that.
it
isn't
just
going
up
and
[indicating;]
that's
it.
it's
a
process
called
bracketing.
they
describe
it
at
length.
the
officer,
the
dog
officer,
said
he
was
in
a
rush
that
day
and
it
didn't
take
more
than
5
to
10
minutes.
and
my
question
really
is
whether
an
ordinary
homeowner
expects
people
to
walk
down
the
curtilage
and,
with
a
big
animal,
and
the
animal
--
they
don't
knock.
they
behave
in
the
page
96,
97,
98
way.
i
subjectively
think,
well,
that's
pretty
unusual
behavior,
whether
it's
a
policeman
or
anybody
else.
so
what
do
you
respond?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was
5
to
10
minutes
and
it's
96-97.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
assuming
the
conclusion
in
these
things.
i
mean,
i
thought
since
katz
the
rule
has
been
whether
the
homeowner
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
--
which
is
infringed
or
violated
or
interfered
with
when
the
government
acts.
so
that's
a
question
of
does
he
have
that
reasonable
expectation.
so
now
we're
back
to
exactly
where
we
were.
your
opponents
say,
no,
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
protect
a
person
with
a
dog
coming
up
to
the
door
and
going
[indicating,]
all
right?
now,
your
response
to
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
question
was,
as
justice
alito
put
it,
why?
he
says,
we
go
back
to
the
17th
century,
as
far
as
you
want,
and
there
is
no
law
that
says
there
is
any
kind
of
expectation
in
a
homeowner
that
a
person
won't
walk
up
to
the
dog
--
to
the
door
with
a
dog
on
a
leash
and
sniff,
which,
as
he
says
--
which
your
opponents
say
is
what
happened
here.
and
your
response
to
that
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
look
at
this
later,
but
i'm
rather
surprised.
my
understanding
of
the
case
law
was
the
chief
justice's,
and
i
thought
what
you're
supposed
to
look
at
is
the
behavior
of
the
individual,
the
police
officer,
who
comes
to
the
door
or
looks
into
the
house,
not
his
subjective
motive.
now,
as
we
just
heard,
you
said,
and
with
support
here,
that
jones
changed
that,
but
i
don't
know
what
in
jones
changed
that.
jones
is
the
case
where
the
police
did
in
fact
go
to
a
person's
car
and
physically
put
something
in
it.
that's
--
something
that
tracked.
that's
behavior.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
it
in
jones
that
said
what
we're
supposed
to
look
at
is
not
behavior,
but
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
it
may
be
a
search.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
a
police
officer.
if
we
start
--
policemen
have
to
know
how
to
behave.
and
in
this
area,
they
can
behave
the
same
way
as
other
people
can
behave,
and
we
expect
them
to
behave,
even
though
their
motive
differs.
they're
always
trying
to
find
crime.
that's
what
i
thought
the
law
was.
i've
been
trying
to
figure
out
just
what
you
say,
but
in
a
slightly
different
form.
do
people
come
up
to
the
door
with
dogs?
yes.
do
the
dogs
breathe?
do
in
fact
policemen,
like
other
people,
come
up
and
breathe?
do
we
expect
it?
yes,
we
expect
people
to
come
up
and
breathe.
but
do
we
expect
them
to
do
what
happened
here?
and
at
that
point,
i
get
into
the
question:
what
happened
here?
and
i'd
be
interested
in
your
view
on
that.
