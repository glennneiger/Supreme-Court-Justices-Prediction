justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
first
reason
is
--
is
so
broad,
it
is
clearly
incorrect.
it's
so
broad,
you
ought
to
go
on
to
your
second
reason.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
know,
we've
had
hundreds
of
years
of
trespass
cases
in
this
country
and
in
england.
has
there
--
do
you
have
a
single
case
holding
that
it
is
a
trespass
for
a
person
with
a
dog
to
walk
up
to
the
front
door
of
a
house?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
really
wasn't
my
question,
was
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
a
dog
on
a
leash
is
brought
up
to
the
front
door
of
a
person's
house,
was
that
a
trespass
at
the
time
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
case
that
says
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
don't
have
the
case.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
he
goes
to--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--he
goes
to
deliver
the
tickets,
and
he
sniffs?
he
doesn't
intend
to
sniff
before
he
goes,
but
he
goes
the
deliver
the
tickets,
and
he
smells
the
marijuana.
is
that
a
search?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
he
doing
exactly
the
same
thing.
two
officers
go
up
to
two
identical
houses.
one
goes
up
with
the
subjective
intent
to
sniff.
the
other
one
goes
up
with
the
subjective
intent
to
drop
off
the
tickets
to
the
policeman's
ball.
your
answer
is
one
is
a
search,
one
is
not
a
search.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
the
relevance
of
technology
was
that
the
technology
that
we
have
now
was
not
necessarily
--
was
not
--
much
of
it
was
not
available
at
the
time
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted,
so
we
can't
tell
what
the
--
what
people
in
1791
would
have
thought
about
it.
but
that's
not
true
of
dogs.
dogs
were
around.
they
have
been
around
for
10,000
years.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
they've
been
used
--
and
they've
been
used
to
detect
scents
for
10,000
--
for
thousands
of
years.
certainly,
they
were
available
for
that
purpose
in
1791,
weren't
they?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
they
had
been
trained
to
track
people,
had
they
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
in
1791,
if
someone
--
if
the
police
were
using
--
or
somebody
was
using
a
bloodhound
to
track
someone
who
was
suspected
of
a
crime,
and
the
bloodhound
--
and
they
used
the
bloodhound
to
track
the
person
to
the
front
of
--
to
the
front
door
of
a
house,
would
that
have
been
regarded
as
a
trespass?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what's
the
case
that
says
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
without
implied
consent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
actual
or
implied
consent.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
are
there
cases
that
say
that
the
implied
consent
exists
only
where
the
person
is
coming
to
the
door
for
a
purpose
that
the
homeowner
would
approve
if
the
homeowner
knew
the
purpose
of
the
person
coming
to
the
door?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
why
is
that?
why
is
that?
if
you
took
a
poll
of
people
and
said
do
you
want
--
do
you
want
police
officers
who
suspect
you
of
possibly
engaging
in
criminal
conduct
to
come
to
your
front
door
and
knock
on
the
door
so
they
can
talk
to
you
and
attempt
to
get
incriminating
information
out
of
you,
would
most
people
say,
yeah,
i
consent
to
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
draw
a
distinction
between
dogs
that
are
not
drug
detection
dogs
and
ordinary
dogs.
would
you
draw
the
same
distinction
between
a
police
officer
who
is
not
expert
at
detecting
the
smell
of
methamphetamine
and
a
police
officer
who
is
expert
at
detecting
the
smell
of
that
drug?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
to
knock
on
the
front
door,
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
don't
we
have
to
accept
that?
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
as
a
statement
of
florida
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
we
not
have
to
accept
that
as
a
statement
of
florida
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
the
reason
--
i
thought
the
rationale
in
jones,
what
jones
added,
was
that
it
is
a
search
if
it
was
a
trespass.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
so
i
come
back
to
the
very
first
question
i
asked
you,
do
you
have
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
this
would
be
a
trespass?
any
case
that
says
this
is
--
any
trespass
case
in
the
last
five
hundred
years
in
any
english-speaking
country?
