justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right.
and
there's
such
a
thing
as
what
is
called
the
curtilage
of
a
house.
as
i
understand
the
law,
the
police
are
entitled
to
use
binoculars
to
look
into
the
house
if
--
if
the
residents
leave
the
blinds
open,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
can't
see
clearly
enough
from
a
distance,
they're
not
entitled
to
go
onto
the
curtilage
of
the
house,
inside
the
gate,
and
use
the
binoculars
from
that
vantage
point,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
the
same
thing
with
the
dog?
this
dog
was
brought
right
up
--
right
up
to
the
--
to
the
door
of
the
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
we've
taken
an
unrealistic
case,
if
that
has
been
conceded,
because
it
seems
to
me
crucial
that
this
officer
went
onto
the
portion
of
the
house
that
--
as
to
which
there
is
privacy,
and
--
and
used
a
means
of
--
of
discerning
what
was
in
the
house
that
--
that
should
not
have
been
available--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
that
space.
justice
antonin
scalia
police
officers
can
come
there
to
knock
on
the
door,
but
i
thought
you've
conceded
that
police
officers
can't
come
there
to
look
into
the
house
with
binoculars,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
purpose
of
the
officer's
going
there
is
to
--
is
to
conduct
a
search,
it's
not
permitted.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
just
the
sniffing
in
the
abstract.
it's
the
sniffing
at
this
point,
the
sniffing
at
a
person's
front
door,
right?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
didn't
say
it
wouldn't
be
a
search
if
the
police
officer
himself
did
that
if
he
went
there
with
the
intention
of
--
of
smelling
at
the
door.
he's
going
there
to
search,
and
he
shouldn't
be
on
the
curtilage
to
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
--
you
have
someone
who,
who
has
been
guilty
of
a
crime.
he
has
--
he
has
the
body.
he
has
committed
a
murder
and
he
has
the
body
in
the
home.
he
certainly
wants
to
keep
that
private,
right?
and
he
foolishly
and
mistakenly
leaves
the
blinds
open
in
the
room
where
--
where
the
corpse
is
lying,
and
the
policeman
at
a
great
distance
has
a
telescope
and
he
looks
through
the
blinds
and
he
sees
the
corpse.
can
the
police
go
into
the
home?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh
--
he
hasn't
knowingly.
he
was
careless.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
certainly
wanted
to
keep
it
--
he
wanted
to
keep
it
private.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
here.
they
wanted
to
keep
private
the
fact
that
they
were
growing
the
marijuana,
but
they
--
they
used
a
means
of
suppressing
the
heat
that
made
it
impossible
to
keep
it
private.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
were
careless.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
were
the
mothballs.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
mr.
blumberg,
i
think
you're,
with
respect,
misguided
to
concede
that
if
it
was
just
the
officer
alone
without
the
dog,
it
would
be
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
you
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
would
assume
you
would
say
that
if
the
officer
walks
up
there
with
no
intention
to
knock
and
talk,
but
just
walks
up
to
the
door
with
the
intention
of
sniffing
at
the
door,
you
would
consider
that
to
be
a
violation,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
again,
i
think
you're
wrong
not
to
accept
that.
i
think
our
cases
support
it.
i
think
you
cannot
enter
the
protected
portion
of
a
home,
which
is
called
the
curtilage,
with
the
intention
of
conducting
a
search,
that
that
is
not
permitted.
i
think
our
cases
establish
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
fine
to
say
--
i
don't
think
it's
true
that
the
intent
of
the
officer
is
never
relevant.
it
is
relevant
in
that
context.
the
reason
for
the
officer
going
onto
protected
property,
if
he's
going
on
just
to
knock
on
the
door
to
sell
tickets
to
the
policeman's
ball,
that's
fine.
if
he's
going
on
to
conduct
a
search,
that's
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
do
say
that
this
is
an
easier
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
sidewalk
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
--
there's
an
implied
license
to
--
to
go
on
to
the
curtilage
for
most
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
curtilage
is
--
is
not
sacrosanct
to
do
certain
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
come
out
from
behind
these
briefs
here.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
police
received
a
tip
that
the
respondent
joelis
jardines
was
growing
marijuana
in
his
home.
a
surveillance
team
went
to
the
home
but
saw
nothing.
two
officers
then
took
a
dog
trained
to
detect
the
smell
of
illegal
drugs
and
approached
jardines'
home.
the
dog
and
his
handler
walked
up
to
the
front
porch.
after
sniffing
around
and
going
back
and
forth
on
the
porch,
the
dog
eventually
sat
down
in
front
of
jardines'
front
door
which
is
what
he
was
trained
to
do
upon
finding
the
odor's
strongest
point.
the
officers
then
secured
a
search
warrant
using
what
they
had
learned
as
establishing
probable
cause
and
marijuana
plants
were
found
in
the
home.
at
trial,
jardines
moved
to
suppress
that
evidence
arguing
that
when
the
officers
brought
the
dog
up
to
his
door,
they
had
searched
his
home
without
probable
cause
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
trial
court
agreed
with
him,
so
did
the
supreme
court
of
florida
and
so
do
we.
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
this
case
does
not
concern
what
it
means
for
a
search
to
be
unreasonable.
rather,
the
question
here
is
more
fundamental.
what
actions
constitute
a
search?
the
basic
rule
is
that
a
search
occurs
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
when
the
government
physically
intrudes
for
investigative
purposes
on
one
of
the
areas
that
the
amendment
protects,
that
is,
intrudes
on
to
persons,
houses,
papers,
or
effects.
our
later
cases
have
supplemented
this
test
but
the
basic
approach
keeps
easy
cases
easy
and
by
those
lights,
this
is
an
easy
case
indeed.
first,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
officers
physically
intruded
into
an
area
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
in
our
law
of
search
and
seizure,
the
home
is
first
among
equals.
at
the
amendment's
absolute
core
is
the
right
of
a
man
to
retreat
into
his
own
home
and
there
be
free
from
the
state's
gaze.
the
area
immediately
surrounding
the
home
which
is
called
the
curtilage
has
long
been
regarded
as
part
of
the
home
itself.
the
police
cannot
without
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause
hang
around
on
the
lawn
or
in
the
side
garden,
trawling
for
evidence
and
perhaps
peering
into
the
windows
of
the
house.
and
the
officers
here
had
all
four
of
their
feet
and
all
four
of
their
companions
planted
firmly
on
that
curtilage.
the
front
porch
is
the
classic
example
of
an
area
intimately
associated
with
the
life
of
the
house.
the
only
remaining
question
is
whether
jardines
had
given
the
officers
permission
even
implicitly
to
be
on
his
porch.
he
had
not.
it
is
true
that
by
hanging
a
knocker
on
the
front
door,
we
implicitly
invite
visitors
including
the
police
to
approach
our
homes
in
hopes
of
speaking
with
us.
but
the
scope
of
that
invitation
is
limited
to
a
particular
place,
to
a
brief
duration,
and
just
as
importantly
to
a
particular
purpose.
no
one
is
invited
to
come
up
to
the
home
simply
to
snoop
around.
no
door-to-door
salesman
would
think
himself
licensed
to
stand
on
the
front
porch
and
peer
into
the
windows.
and
no
neighbor
would
think
it
proper
to
slip
a
metal
detector
around
the
front
lawn
before
coming
to
the
door
and
asking
permission.
the
officers
here
were
on
the
porch
to
gather
evidence,
nothing
more,
and
we
have
no
trouble
concluding
that
the
social
norms
that
invite
a
visitor
to
the
front
door
do
not
extend
that
far.
we
therefore
need
not
and
do
not
decide
whether
the
officers
violated
the
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
approach
described
in
katz
versus
united
states,
that
the
officers
learned
what
they
learned
only
by
gathering
evidence
in
a
constitutionally
protected
area
is
enough
to
know
that
a
search
occurred.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
affirmed.
justice
kagan
has
flied
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
sotomayor
joined.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
kennedy
and
breyer
joined.
