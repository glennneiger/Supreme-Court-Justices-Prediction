well,
that's
not
what
the
record
says,
mr.
garre.
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
the
record
suggests
that
he
put
the
dog
on
a
very
long
leash,
the
dog
goes
back
and
forth,
tries
to
figure
out
where
the
smell
is
coming
from.
it's
not
just
--
you
know,
my
first
thought
was
you
go
up
to
the
door,
the
dog
barks
once,
and
that's
it.
but
you
read
the
record,
this
dog
is
there
for
some
extended
period
of
time,
going
back
and
forth
and
back
and
forth,
trying
to
figure
out
where
the
greatest
concentration
of
the
smell
is.
it
actually
seemed,
from
my
reading
of
the
record,
to
be,
you
know,
a
lengthy
and
obtrusive
process.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
garre,
this
is
what
we
said
in
kyllo.
and
i'm
just
going
to
read
it.
we
said,
"we
think
that
obtaining
by
sense-enhancing
technology
any
information
regarding
the
interior
of
the
home
that
could
not
otherwise
have
been
obtained
without
physical
intrusion
into
a
constitutionally
protected
area
constitutes
a
search,
at
least
where,
as
here,
the
technology
in
question
is
not
in
general
public
use.
"
so
what
part
of
that
do
you
think
separates
your
case
from
this
one?
in
other
words,
what
part
of
that
language
does
not
apply
in
this
case?
justice
elena
kagan
so
does
that
mean
that
if
we
invented
some
kind
of
little
machine
called
a,
you
know,
smell-o-matic
and
the
police
officer
had
this
smell-o-matic
machine,
and
it
alerted
to
the
exact
same
things
that
a
dog
alerts
to,
it
alerted
to
a
set
of
drugs,
meth
and
marijuana
and
whatever
else,
the
police
officer
could
not
come
to
the
front
door
and
use
that
machine?
justice
elena
kagan
so
your
basic
distinction
is
the
difference
between
like
a
machine
and
franky.
justice
elena
kagan
that
we
should
not
understand
franky
as
kind
of
a
sense-enhancing
law
enforcement
technology,
but
we
should
think
of
him
as
just
like
a
guy.
justice
elena
kagan
how
does
what
you're
saying,
ms.
saharsky,
square
with
karo?
because
in
karo,
the
only
thing
that
the
beeper
alerted
to
in
the
home
was
the
can
of
ether,
which
was
clearly
an
item
that
was
being
used
for
drug
manufacture.
and
there
was
nothing
else
other
than
that
item,
which
you
might
not
call
it
contraband,
but
it
was
evidence
of
illegality,
this
can
of
ether.
there
was
no
thought
that
it
was
used
for
anything
else.
and
that
was
the
only
thing
that
the
beeper
alerted
it
to;
and,
yet,
nonetheless,
we
said,
you
know,
of
course
that's
a
search.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
not
lawful
uses
in
somebody's
house.
i
mean,
maybe
lawful
uses
in
a
factory
or
in
an
operating
room,
but
nobody
has
cans
of
ether
in
their
house
unless
they're
making
drugs.
justice
elena
kagan
but
in
kyllo
--
and
i
think
this
was
what
justice
kennedy
was
saying.
in
kyllo,
there
was
already
a
seizure
that
had
happened,
and
the
court
just
said,
this
is
no
--
this
is
really
no
greater
an
intrusion.
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
that's
clearly
--
you
do
concede
if
the
police
officer
walks
up
to
the
door,
smells
it
himself,
no
problem
there;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
but
smells
it
himself,
so
there's
no
problem
there.
so
the
difference
is
the
dog.
so
what
difference
does
the
dog
make?
suppose
the
dog
were
not
doing
this
ten-minute
bracketing
that
justice
breyer
was
talking
about.
suppose
this
really
were
a
very
simple
procedure.
the
dog
comes
up,
takes
a
sniff,
barks,
sits
down.
and,
you
know,
to
make
it
even
more,
the
dog
is
not
a
scary-looking
dog,
the
dog
is
a
cockapoo.
so
just
like,
you
know,
your
neighbor
with
his
cockapoo
walks
up
to
your
door
all
the
time,
that's
what
this
police
officer
has
done.
why
do
you
win
that?
justice
elena
kagan
the
dog
does
what
your
neighbor's
dog
does.
justice
elena
kagan
--that
if
they
select
somebody
with
a
sense
of
smell
because
they
have
gotten
a
tip
of
drugs
in
a
house,
that
we
give
up,
in
that
situation,
the
assumption
that
they
went
to
investigate.
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
think,
mr.
garre,
that
the--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
think,
mr.
garre,
that
you
have
to
concede
that
this
is
a
case
about
police
use
--
call
it
a
technology,
call
it
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
--
of
something
that
enhances
what
normal
people
can
sense.
and
then
the
question
becomes,
do
you
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in,
basically,
people
just
having
their
normal
senses,
rather
than
some
technique
or
method
or
technology
that
enhances
those
senses?
so
that
your
implied
consent
or
expectations
about
your
neighbor
might
differ
fundamentally,
you
know,
if
the
neighbor
comes
and
knocks
on
your
door,
or
if
the
neighbor
brings
his
magnifying
glass
and
his
microscope
and
everything
else
and
starts
testing
everything
around
it.
you
might
say,
no,
that's
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
there
for
that.
