mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
police
officers
taking
a
narcotics
detection
dog
up
to
the
front
door
of
a
house
is
a
fourth
amendment
search
for
two
distinct
and
separate
reasons.
first,
when
police
reveal
any
details
inside
a
home
which
an
individual
seeks
to
keep
private,
that
is
a
fourth
amendment
search
and
that
is
exactly
what
a
narcotics
detection
dog
is
doing,
revealing
details
in
the
home
the
individual
seeks
to
keep
private.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
justice
kennedy,
i
would
add
a
few
words
to
the
end
of
that
statement:
anything
that
an
individual
seeks
to
keep
private
in
the
home,
and
that's
the
difference.
your
hypothet
about
conversation,
certainly
a
police
officer
can
talk
to
someone
and
ask
them
questions
about--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--certainly,
but
in
that
hypothet--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--in
that
situation,
the
person
inside
the
home
has
knowingly
exposed
what
is
inside
the
home
to
the
public.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
but
i
--
i
understood
under
your
hypothetic
that
he
knowingly
left
the
blinds
open.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
certainly;
and
the
defendant
in
reilly
wanted
to
keep
the
marijuana
private.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
that--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--i
--
i
don't
believe
there
is
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
the
air
conditioner
was
blowing
the
smell
of
marijuana
out
from
the
house
in
a
very
strong
manner.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--there
were
mothballs
there,
and
detective
bartelt,
the
dog
handler
that
was
standing
at
the
front
door
as
well,
testified
without
contradiction
or
without
hesitation
he
didn't
smell
anything.
so
if
--
if
mr.
garre's
representation
about
an
air
conditioner
basically
blowing
the
smell
of
marijuana
outside
the
house
so
that
anybody
would
smell
it--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--the
mothballs
presumably
were
there
to
--
to
mask
the
smell
of
an
odor
coming
from
the
house.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
it's
manifesting
an
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
the
expectation
of
privacy
on
the
--
in
the
details,
what's
going
on
inside
your
house.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
but
that's
knowingly
exposing
what's
inside
the
house.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
but
assuming
that's
what
the
mothballs
were
there
for,
that's
to
keep
the
odor
inside
the
house,
so
that
the
public
cannot
find
--
cannot
detect
that
odor,
unless
you
go
up
there--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--there's
--
there
is
really
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
--
the
only
people
who
testified
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress
were
the
two
police
officers.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
the
--
when
a
police
officer
takes
a
narcotic
detection
dog
up
to
the
front
door
of
the
house,
that
is
also
a
fourth
amendment
search
because
that
is
a
physical
trespass
upon
the
constitutionally
protected
area
of
the
curtilage
of
the
home.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
there
are
cases
that
go
back
to
the
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
the,
the
citations
--
but
there
are
cases
in
the
1700s
that
established
that
basically
a
dog
running
on
to
someone
else's
property
is
a
trespass.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
thought
your
question
was
if
a
dog
comes
on
to
private
property--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--if
it
was
without
the
consent
of
the
homeowner,
yes,
it
was
a
trespass.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
do
not
have
a
case.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--my
response
to
that
is
that
does
violate
the
resident's
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
my
response
to
that
is
that
any
entry
onto
private
property
in
the
1700's
was
a
trespass,
was
the
tort
of
trespass,
unless
it
was
with
consent.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
absolutely
not,
justice
ginsburg.
what
i
--
what
i
said
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
i
was
given
a
hypothet
about
an
officer
coming
up
by
himself
without
the
dog
to
knock
on
the
front
door
and
talk
to
the
homeowner.
and
i
said
that
i
conceded
that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
and
this
court
has
stated
as
much
in
kentucky
v.
king.
and
then
the
court
said
to
me,
what's
the
difference?
and
i
said
the
dog.
and
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying
here.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
if
the
police
officer
is
perform
--
is
knocking
on
the
door,
part
of
a
knock
and
talk,
yes;
but,
if
the
police--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--well,
whether
it's
a
cockapoo
or
franky,
who,
from
all
the
pictures,
appears
to
be
a
very
cute
dog,
it's
not
what
the
dog
looks
like,
it's
what
the
dog
is
doing
on
the
front
porch,
which
is--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--well,
no,
this
dog
--
the
neighbor's
dog
does
not
search
for
evidence
on
your
front
porch.
that's
the
key
distinction.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
did
not
mean
to
concede
that,
and
i
was
going
to
say
that.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
was
about
to
return
your--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--and
that
was
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
in
response
to
justice
kagan's
question.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
and
i
am
not
arguing
that.
i
am
arguing--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--it
depends
what
the
officer
does
at
the
front
door,
not
what
his
state
of
mind
is.
if
the
officer
goes
up
to
the
front
door
and
starts
sniffing
around
the
cracks
and
crevices--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--that's--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--it
is
not
because
he
is
not
performing
any
type
of
search.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
not
going
up
to
sniff.
if
he
goes
up
there
and
does
sniff--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--and
starts
searching
around,
looking
in
the
windows--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--no,
because
he's
not
performing
any
kind
of
search.
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
an
officer--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--no,
and
i
am
not
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
tying
it
to
the
subjective
intent
of
the
officer.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
believe
the
language--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--the
language
in
this
court's
opinion
in
jones
is
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
a
search.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
this
court's
decisions
establish
that
a
police
officer
does
not
have
to
close
his
eyes
when
he
goes
up
to
the
front
door
of
a
house
to
do
a
knock
and
talk.
he
does
not
have
to
hold
his
nose
to
prevent.
anything
that
he
naturally
observes
using
his
ordinary
senses
when
he
is
there
for
a
lawful
purpose
such
as
a
knock
and
talk
is
fine.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
that
would
not
be
a
trespass.
that
would
not
be
a
search
because
a
trespass--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--no,
it's
not
okay,
respectfully,
because
the
dog
would
still
be
revealing
details
inside
the
home
that
the
officer
could
not
reveal
using
his
or
her
ordinary
senses.
that's
our
first
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
but
i
assume
on
your
hypothet
it's
a
policeman
walking
with
his
narcotics
detection
dog
up
and
down
the
street.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
a
dog
that
he
knows
is
trained--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--yes.
and
i
would
submit
that
would
basically
be
the
same
thing
as
a
police
officer
walking
up
and
down
the
street
with
a
thermal
imager
that's
turned
on.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
this
is
an
easier
case,
of
course,
because
the
police
officer
in
this
case
--
and
not
only
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
the
question
presented
is
going
up
to
the
front
door
of
a
home.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
dogs
were
around,
justice
alito--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--but
in
1791,
dogs
had
not
been
trained
to
detect
criminal
activity
within
a
house
--
not
--
i'm
sorry--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--yes.
dogs
have
been
tracking
people--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--yes,
i
believe
it
still
would
have.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
the
--
i
do
not
have
a
case
that
says
that
taking
a
bloodhound
up
to
the
front
door
of
a
house
would
be
a
trespass.
but
if
you
analyze
it
under
the
definition
of
what
a
trespass
is,
it's
an
unlawful
entry
onto
private
property
without
consent
of
the
homeowner.
and
there
is
no--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--right.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
don't
believe
a
homeowner,
back
in
the
1700's,
impliedly
consented
to
police
coming
up
to
the
front
door
of
his
house
with
a
bloodhound,
even
though
everybody
knew
they
could
do
that.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
the
specific
doctrine
is
implied
consent
by
custom.
and
so
you
look
to
what
is
it
customary
for
people
to
accept
in
terms
of
people
coming
onto
their
property.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
it's
very
similar.
the
two
doctrines
are
very
similar.
whether
you're
saying
it's
a
violation
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--if
the
homeowner
chooses
to
engage
in
conversation
with
that
officer
and
his
conversation
is
overheard
on
the
microphone--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--but,
again,
when
you
talk
to
the
police
officer,
that's
a
reasonable
possibility.
you
don't
have
--
it's
not
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
that
if
you
talk
to
a
police
officer,
that
that
might
be
going
out
to
another
police
officer
that's
in
the
car
down
the
street.
but
there's
no
--
a
homeowner
does
not--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--but,
again,
this
particular
case
is
not
--
the
question
presented
does
not
hinge
on
whether
or
not
a
normal
officer
could
smell
it,
because
this
officer,
detective
--
i'm
sorry
--
detective
bartelt
said
he
did
not
smell
it.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
it
does.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
it
does.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
correct.
but
the
definition--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--it's
the
language
in
jones
that
says
one
of
the
elements
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
physical
trespass
constitutes
a
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
is,
is
there
a
physical
trespass,
onto
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
for
the
purpose
of
conducting
a
search.
those
are
the
three
elements
of
the--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--in
this
case,
the
curtilage
of
the
home.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
that
was
your--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--it's
not
a
sidewalk
here.
it's
the
front
door.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
no,
no,
it's
the
front
door
of
the
home
here.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
only
--
only
to
do
certain
things.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
yes.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
such
as
to
try
to
and
sell
girl
scout
cookies,
to
knock
--
even
a
police
officer
can
go
on
to
the
curtilage,
to
knock
on
to
the
door
--
i'm
sorry
--
to
knock
on
the
front
door,
to
try
and
engage
the
person
inside
the
home
in
a
conversation.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
if
what
the
police
officer
was
doing
at
the
front
door
was
a
knock
and
talk.
that
was
the
law--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--without
the
dog.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
yes,
yes.
that's
kentucky
v.
king,
i
believe.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
a
police
--
there's
implied
consent
for
a
police
officer
to
go
up
to
the
front
door,
knock
on
the
door
and
attempt
to
engage
the
person
in
the
house
in
conversation
if
they
open
the
door.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
in
terms
of
consent?
again,
it's
implied
consent
by
custom.
and
i
think
at
this
point
it's
customary
for
people
to
expect
that
police
officers
may
come
to
your
front
door
and
knock
on
your
front
door
to
try
and
talk
to
you.
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
them.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
absolutely.
and
certainly
not
a
narcotics
detection
dog.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
think
a
strong
argument
can
be
made
that
there
is
no
implied
consent
for
anyone
to
bring
a
dog
up
to
the
front
door
of
your
house,
because,
as
you
pointed
out,
a
lot
of
people
don't
like
--
don't
like
dogs
and
--
and
some
people
are
allergic
to
dogs.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
we
are,
but
i
believe
the
hypothet
was
just
any
dog.
but
certainly,
when
it's
--
when
it's
a
dog
trained
to
detect
contraband,
there's
no
question
that
no
one
impliedly
consents
to
that
happening
and
there's
no
question,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
that
a
homeowner
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
that's
not
going
to
happen.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
in
terms
of
the
right
of
that
officer
to
come
up
to
the
house
and
knock
on
the
front
door?
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
no,
there
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
distinction
to
that.
you
impliedly
consent
and
you
have
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
any
type
of
police
officer
is
going
to
come
and
knock
on
your
front
door
and
try
and
talk
to
you.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
and
--
and
just
to
clear
up
the
factual,
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
what
happened
here
in
terms
of
the
use
of
the
drug
detection
dog
took
5
to
15
minutes.
it
didn't
take
5
to
15
minutes.
it
certainly
took,
i
would
say,
at
least
1
or
2
minutes,
because
what
happened
--
and
again,
this
is
on
96,
97
and
98
--
the
officer
goes
from
the
street
over
the
curb,
up
to
the
front
door
of
the
house,
with
the
dog
basically
dragging
him
up
to
the
front
door
of
the
house.
they
go
up
this
walkway
--
and
a
picture
of
the
home
is
--
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
--
and
then
the
dog
crosses
the
--
into
the
alcove,
the
area
right
in
front
of
the
house.
and
once
he
gets
in
that
area,
the
dog
starts
violently
bracketing
back
and
forth,
pulling
on
the
leash.
the
dog
handler
testified
that
the
other
officer
had
to
stay
back,
because
it
was
so
violent
that
people
could
get
knocked
down
by
what's
happening.
and
for
a
period
of
time
the
dog
goes
back
and
forth,
back
and
forth,
and
then
at
some
point
goes
to
the
crack
on
the
bottom
of
the
front
door,
sniffs
that,
and
then
the
process
finally
stops,
he
sits
down.
so
that's
factually
what
happened.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
well,
that's
--
i
did
not
make
that
concession
and
--
no,
i
certainly
did
not
concede
that,
but
the
court
found
that.
and
that's
the
point
i
wanted
to
make.
the
courts,
both
courts
in
florida,
squarely
addressed
that
issue,
justice
ginsburg.
there
is
a
whole
section
in
the
opinion
in
the
third
district
court
of
appeals
saying
the
officer
and
the
dog
were
lawfully
present.
they
didn't
--
that
section
doesn't
go,
defense
counsel
concedes
that
issue.
that
--
that
issue
--
that
part
of
the
opinion
goes:
we
find
that
the
officer
and
the
dog
were
lawfully
present.
so
it's
squarely
before
this
court.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
the
beginning
of
your--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--no.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
no.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
that's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
--
and
just
because
the
third
district
court
of
appeal
found
--
that's
--
that's
what's
before
the
court
today.
that's
why
the
issue
is
squarely
before
the
court.
the
third
district
court
of
appeal
decided
the
officer
had
the
right
to
go
up
and
be
there
on
the
front
porch
with
the
dog.
the
florida
supreme
court
disagreed.
there
is
a
passage
in
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
that
says
an
officer
going
up
to
the
door
--
can
go
up
to
the
door
and
do
a
knock
and
talk,
but
when
the
officer
goes
up
with
a
narcotics
detection
dog,
that
is
a
qualitatively
different
matter.
so
that
issue
is--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--i
think
that
would
lead
more
to
a
determination
that
there
was
a
trespass
because
they
selected
the
officer
who
had
the
best
sense
of
smell
to
go
up
to
that
door.
so
they
weren't
really
going
up
there
to
do
a
knock--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--well,
but
there's
--
knock
and
talks
are
okay;
but,
under
your
hypothet,
it
appears
that
the
knock
and
talk
was
--
was
not
really
what
the
officer
was
going
up
there
for.
they
picked
the
officer
with
the
best
sense
of--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--right.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
no.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
don't--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--no.
but
the
rule
i'm
asking
this
court
to
adopt
does
not
rely
on
the
subjective
intent
of
the
police
officer.
the
rule
i'm
asking
this
court
to
adopt--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--that
--
that
would
be
fine.
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
plain
smell
in
that.
but
if--
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
--no,
no.
what's
not
okay
is
if
he
goes
up
there
to
perform
a
search,
or
if
he
conducts
a
search
--
and,
again,
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
when
a
police
officer
goes
up
to
the
front
door
with
a
narcotics
detection
dog,
there
is
no
question
what
that
officer
is
doing.
that
officer
is
performing
a
search.
and,
therefore,
if
you
go
to
jones,
the
officer
and
the
dog
have
entered
--
have
physically
trespassed,
because
there
is
no
consent
to
do
that,
onto
a
constitutionally
protected
area,
the
curtilage
of
the
home,
and
performed
a
search.
if
you
just
--
you
follow
the
test
set
forth
in
jones
and
apply
it
to
what
happened
here
and
the
question
presented
here,
it
is
a
trespass.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
yes.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
i
don't
believe
any
court
has
faced
this
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
taking
a
police
dog
up
to
the
front
door
of
a
house
is
a
trespass
under
the
common
law.
mr.
howard
k.
blumberg
thank
you.
