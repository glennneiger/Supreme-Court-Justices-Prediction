bader

mr.
garre,
does
your
argument
mean
--
you
say
minimally
intrusive,
and
that
the
dog
will
detect
only
contraband,
that
the
police
then
are
to
go
into
a
neighborhood
that's
known
to
be
a
drug
dealing
neighborhood,
go
into
--
just
go
down
the
street,
have
the
dog
sniff
in
front
of
every
door,
or
go
into
an
apartment
building?
is
that
--
i
gather
that
that
is
your
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
it
--
supposed
the
house
had
on
the
lawn,
no
dogs
allowed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
not
implied
consent
for
the
policeman
to
come
up
with
the
dog.
the
only
purpose
of
the
dog
is
to
detect
contraband.
so
you
can
say,
yes,
there's
an
implied
invitation
to
the
girl
scout
cookie
seller,
to
the
postman,
even
to
the
police
officer,
but
not
police
officer
with
dog,
when
the
only
reason
for
having
the
dog
is
to
find
out
if
there's
contraband
in
the
house.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
not
any
dog.
this
is
a
drug
detecting
dog.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
this
purpose.
you
said
centuries,
but
i
think
you
recognize
that
it
wasn't
until
the
seventies.
i
mean,
the
dogs
were
used
to
find
culprits,
but
to
use
it
in
this
way
i
think
it
was
only
since
the
seventies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
understand
the
concession
to
be
that
the
police
had
come
to
the
door
with
the
dog,
the
sole
purpose
of
the
dog
being
to
detect
contraband.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
agreeing
with
mr.
garre
that
the
police
could
take
a
dog
and
go
down
every
house
on
the
street,
every
apartment
in
the
building?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
house
just
like
this
house.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
so
any
home,
any
home
anywhere,
and
we
should
say
that
that's
okay,
and
we
can
say
it's
okay
because
the
government
won't
use
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
court
has
dealt
with
an
item
that
was
seized
before,
a
piece
of
luggage,
a
car.
they
have
not
dealt
with
the
dog
sniff
in
the
context
of
a
home
that's
not
seized.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about,
mr.
blumberg,
the
government
cited
many,
many
pages
in
the
record,
i
just
took
the
first
one,
petition
--
appendix
to
the
petition,
104
and
105.
the
court
said,
the
officer
and
the
dog
were
lawfully
present
at
the
defendant's
front
door,
and
we
were
told
that
that
was
conceded
by
you
a
number
of
times.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
a
dog
trained
to
detect
contraband--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
just
any
old
dog.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blumberg,
the
florida
appellate
court,
yes,
the
court
of
appeals,
did
say
that
that
the
officer
and
the
dog
were
lawfully
present.
but
you
say
you
didn't
make
that
concession.
