mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
three
prior
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
a
dog
sniff
is
not
a
search,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
a
dog
sniff
is
unique,
both
in
terms
of
the
manner
in
which
information
is
obtained
and
the
nature
of
the
information
revealed.
as
to
the
latter
point,
this
court
has
emphasized
that
a
drug
detection
dog
reveals
only
the
presence
of
contraband,
and
that
no
one
has
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
justice
kennedy,
in
the
caballes
case,
the
contraband
wasn't
visible
before
the
dog
alerted.
in
the
home
case,
we're
not
saying
that
you
don't
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
home.
of
course,
you
do.
the
question
is
whether
you
have
a
legitimate
expectation--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--not
when
it
comes
to
contraband,
your
honor.
and
we
think
that
the
kyllo
case
helps--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--because,
your
honor,
when
you
have
a
search
warrant
and
you
go
into
a
home,
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
private
information
that
you're
going
to
come
across,
even
if
your
expectation
is
finding
evidence
of
a
crime.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
they
could
do
that,
just
like
the
police
could
go
door
to
door
and
to
knock
on
the
doors
and
hope
that
they
will
find
out
evidence
of
wrongdoing
that
way.
but
the
two
responses
this
court
has
always
pointed
to
is
the
restraint
on
resources
and
the
check
of
community
hostility.
here,
the
police
were
combatting
a
serious
epidemic
of
grow
houses,
hundreds
of
houses
each
year
that
were
a
scourge
to
the
community,
not
only
in
terms
just
of
the
drugs
that
they
were
growing--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
that
would
be
different,
your
honor.
it
would
be
--
and
that's
a
way
in
which
the
house
is
different
than
a
car.
homeowners
can
restrict
access
to
people
who
come
up
to
their
front
door
by
putting
gates
or
a
sign
out
front.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
they're
not,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
first
of
all,
i
think
that,
as
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
the
police
were
lawfully
present
at
the
front
door.
that
was
established
by
the
courts
below,
and
we
don't
think
that
they've
challenged
it
here.
that's
at
least
true
with
respect
to
the
police
officer.
the
police
officer
could
go
up
to
the
front
door
and
knock
and
detect
the
smell
of
marijuana,
just
like
officer
pedraja
did.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
i
think
the
way
you
would--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
the
way
that
you
would
answer
that
question,
your
honor,
is,
of
course,
there's
a
curtilage
that
extends
around
the
house
and
protects,
in
which
the
homeowner
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
it's
well
established,
we
think,
going
back
to
the
common
law,
that
there
is
an
implied
consent
for
people,
visitors,
salesmen,
girl
scouts,
trick-or-treaters,
to
come
up
to
your
house
and
knock
on
the
door--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
first
of
all,
i
think,
if
the
girl
scout
or
the
salesman
or
the
trick-or-treater
brought
up
a
dog
with
them,
there
would
be
implied
consent
for
that
too,
at
least
as
long
as
the
dog
was
on
a
leash.
i
don't
think
the
subjective--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
that's
right.
but
i
don't
think
it
changes
the
subjective
purpose
of
why
they
brought
the
dog
with
them.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
you
can
certainly
put
the
“
no
dogs
allowed
”
sign
out
front.
and
there,
there
would
not
be
implied
consent.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
we
start
with
the
proposition
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
certainly
not
in
an
apartment,
your
honor.
this
search
took
place,
the
dog
walked
up
the
same
way
that
a
salesman
would
and
alerted
at
the
front
of
the
door.
he
didn't
go
in--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
i
think
--
and
certainly
this
is
true
in
my
neighborhood,
your
honor,
is
neighbors
can
bring
their
dog
up
on
the
leash
when
they
knock
on
your
front
door,
and
i
think
that's
true
in
most
neighborhoods
in
america.
homeowners
that
don't
like
dogs
and
want
them
off
their
property
have
a
way
to
combat
that,
and
that's
putting
a
fence
around
it
to
say,
no
dogs--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--allowed.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
they
could,
your
honor.
there
are
certainly
houses
that
have
that.
but
with
respect
to
the
question--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
i
think
--
your
honor,
i
think
the
reason
why
that
doesn't
work
here
is
that
if
you
ask
that
question
with
respect
to
the
officer,
i
think
it's
well
settled
or
accepted
that
police
officers
can
walk
up
the
front
path,
absent
a
sign
or
something,
knock
on
the
door--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
it
would,
your
honor.
i
think
that
we're
talking
about
going
up
there,
knocking
on
the
door.
the
police
officer
cannot
just--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--with
binoculars--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--if
the
purpose
of
the
police
officer
here,
for
example,
was
to
walk
up
to
the
house,
hope
that
they
answered
the
door,
or
hope
that
once
they
were
up
there,
that
they
would
smell
the
odor
of
marijuana,
as
officer
pedraja
did,
that
would
not
convert
it
into
a
search.
there
was
no
invasion,
physical
invasion.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
what
--
i
think
what
happened
here--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
think
everyone
accepts
when
someone
comes
to
your
door,
they
can
avail
themselves
of
their
god-given
senses,
whether
it's
looking
into
a
window
without
binoculars,
taking
--
breathing
in
and
smelling
the
air,
as
officer
pedraja
did.
i
don't
think
there's
a
constitutional
difference
when
the
person
has--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
what
i
think
you
can
say
there
is
implied
consent
to
is
a
dog
accompanying
a
person
on
a
leash
walking
up
to
the
front
door,
taking
a
sniff
in
a
matter
of
seconds,
not
minutes--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
i
think
what
the
record
shows
is,
is
that
the
dog
was
on
the
scene,
i.e.,
at
the
curb,
walking
up,
going
back
into
the
car,
and
then
leaving,
for
a
total
of
5
to
10
minutes.
walking
up
to
the
front
steps,
sniffing,
alerting
and
leaving
is
a
matter
of
seconds
or
minutes.
it's
not
--
the
dog
isn't
up
there
for
5
to
10
minutes.
it
happens
very
quickly.
i
think
in
thinking
about
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
physically
what's
happening
in
these
houses.
these
people
are
growing
drugs
in
the
houses
with
the
aid
of
electricity
and
light
and
heat.
and
they
need
--
they
need
air
conditioning
in
order
to
control
the
heat.
and
that
air
conditioning
is
blowing
a
very
strong
odor
of
drugs
out
into
the
public,
and
the
people
know
that.
they
know
that.
we
know
they
know
that
because
they
use
mothballs,
which
officer
pedraja
found
here
at
the
front
of
the
house,
outside
of
the
house.
and
so
what
you're
talking
about,
although
we
talk
about
what's
going
on
in
the
home,
really
what's
happening
here
is
odor
of
illegal
contraband
is
being
blown
out
into
the
street
and
someone
is
coming
up
to
it
and
using
their
god-given
senses
in
a
way
that
humans
and
dogs
have
used
for
centuries
and
detecting
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
you
need
probable
cause
just
for
the
dog
to
sniff.
no,
that's
absolutely
right.
and
the
dog
sniff
itself
clearly
is
not
a
physical
invasion
in
the
same
way
that
looking
is
not
a
physical
invasion
under
the
common
law.
and
the
dog,
we
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
if
it
wasn't
a
search
for
the
police
officer
to
walk
up
there
and
sniff
and
report
smelling
live
marijuana,
then
it
wasn't
a
search
when
franky
walked
up
there
and
alerted
to
the
presence
of
an
illegal
narcotic.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
think
it's
been
conceded
in
this
case,
at
least
it
was
below,
that
the
officer
could
walk
up
there,
knock
on
the
door,
report
the
smell
of
marijuana,
and
that
that
was
not
a
search.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
first
of
all,
franky's
nose
is
not
technology.
it's
--
he's
using
--
he's
availing
himself
of
god-given
senses
in
the
way
that
dogs
have
helped
mankind
for
centuries.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
think
the
contraband
rationale
would
be
the
same.
it
would
be
different
in
that
you
don't
have
technology
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction
because,
as
we
read
kyllo,
the
court
was
very
concerned
about
advances
in
technology,
and
that's
just
not
true
for
a
dog's
nose.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
i
think
that's
true
for
two
reasons.
one
is
franky
is
using
the
same
sense
of
smell
that
dogs
have
used
for
centuries.
so
this
isn't
a
case
where
if
you
allow
a
dog
to
sniff
today,
he
might
use
x-ray
vision
in
the
future.
that's
not
going
to
happen.
and
the
other
thing
is
that
franky
--
that
the
use
of
dogs
for
their
sense
of
smell,
which
everyone
agrees
is
extraordinary,
mankind
has
been
using
them
for
law
enforcement
type
purposes
for
centuries.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
to
use
it
for
drug
detection
purposes,
that's
right.
but
they've
--
we've
been
using
dogs
to
track
thieves
for
centuries
going
back
before
the
founding.
scotland
yard
--
scotland
yard
used
dogs
to
track
jack
the
ripper.
that's
the
same
type
of
way
in
which
they
are
being
used
here.
the
fact
is
today
they're
looking
for
drugs
in
this
context,
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--they
have
a
much
better
sense
of
smell,
that's
right.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--he's
--
the
dogs,
no
doubt,
have
an
enhanced
sense
of
smell
compared
to
the
officer.
but
i
think
that's
really
not
functionally
different
than
using
an
airplane
to
look
into
the
house,
like
in
florida
v.
reilly.
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
this
case
is
a
lot
like
that.
in
florida
v.
reilly,
the
officers
used
a
helicopter
to
fly
over
the
drug
house,
and
they
saw
exposed
marijuana.
here,
you're
using
the
drug
detection
dog
to
smell
the
odor
of
marijuana
that
is
being
pumped
out
of
the
house
into
the
street.
and
the
people
who
use
the
house
know
that.
they
know
that,
and
we
know
they
know
that
because
the
mothballs
were
present.
mothballs
are
a
masking
agent.
people
don't
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
this
court
has
held,
in
things
that
they
knowingly
expose
to
the
public,
even
in
the
home.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
florida
v.
reilly.
it's
what
it
said
in
katz
itself.
and
i
think,
here,
one
way
to
resolve
it
is
to
say
people
who
live
in
grow
houses
with
a
distinct
odor
of
marijuana,
who
know
that
that
is
being
pumped
out
into
the
street
because
of
the
air
conditioning
that
they
need
to
run
the
grow
houses,
there
is
no
invasion
in
their
--
in
their
expectation
of
privacy
when
either
a
man
or
a
dog,
when
lawfully
present
on
the
property,
uses
their
god-given
senses
to
detect
that.
if
i
could
reserve--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--thank
you.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
with
the
question
of
how
long
they
were
at
the
scene,
the
record
says
that
they
were
at
the
scene
for
five
to
ten
minutes.
that's
--
that
includes
in
the
car;
walking
up
to
the
door,
which
my
friend
conceded
was
a
minute
or
two;
and,
then
back
in
the
car
and
leaving.
with
respect
to
the
bracketing,
bracketing
just
means
that
the
dog
is
getting
excited,
moving
his
head
around.
this
is
a
passive
alert
dog.
they
get
a
little
bit
excited
and
then
sit
down.
it's
no
different
than
what
a
neighbor's
dog
would
do
when
they
get
to
the
front
door.
second,
with
respect
to
state
law,
we
do
think
it's
important.
and
florida
has
a
decision,
state
v.--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--yes.
they're
walking
up
the
common
path,
and
you
can
see
it
from
the
picture
at
the
--
appended
to
the
brief,
and
then
up
to
the
front
door.
it's
near
the
front
door
where
he
alerted
by
sitting
down.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
he's
sniffing;
he's
breathing.
that's
right.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
with
respect
to
state
law,
state
v.
morsman,
394
so.2d
408
at
409,
this
was
a
case
that
came
up
during
oral
argument
in
the
supreme
court.
it
says
that,
under
florida
law,
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
porch,
taking
into
account
that
visitors
and
salesmen
can
come
up
to
the
front
door.
and
i
think
that
that's
pertinent
here.
justice
kennedy,
if
you
don't
like
the
contraband
rationale,
then
i
hope
you
would
consider
the
knowingly
exposed
to
the
public
rationale.
here,
the
record
does
show
that
they
--
drug
houses
do
vent
the
stuff
outside.
it's
page
a-48
of
the
joint
appendix.
that's
in
the
warrant,
where
they
talk
about
what
the
air
conditioning
unit
does
to
the
scent
of
marijuana
in
the
house.
we
know
that
they
knew
about
that
because
officer
bartelt
came
across
the
moth
balls
--
that's
on
page
100
of
the
joint
appendix
--
outside
of
the
house.
the
mothballs
were
outside
of
the
house,
which
means--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--which
means
that
they
knew
that
the
odors
were
outside
the
house.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
and
i
think
that
gets
back
to
our
point
that
this
is
a
dog
that's
been
used
by
humans
for
centuries
by
scent.
and
in
that
respect,
it's
quite
different
than
the
helicopter
that
was
used
for
aerial
surveillance
in
florida
v.
reilly.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
your
honor.
