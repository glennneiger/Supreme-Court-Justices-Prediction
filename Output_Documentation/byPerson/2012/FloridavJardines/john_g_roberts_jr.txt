chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-564,
florida
v.
jardines.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we've
had
a
lot
of
--
we've
had
a
lot
of
discussion
about
whether
it's
5
minutes
or
15
minutes
or
whether
it's
mothballs.
i
understood
the
issue
before
us
to
be
whether
or
not
under
the
fourth
amendment
it
is
a
search
for
a
dog
to
come
up
to
the
door
and
sniff,
not
with
respect
to
--
we're
not
making
a
judgment,
i
thought,
on
the
probable
cause
in
light
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
but
the
ground
of
decision
below
was
this
is
a
search
when
the
dog
sniffs.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
follow
up
on
justice
breyer's
question,
because
it
strikes
me
as
a
little
confusing.
does
the
dog,
as
soon
as
he
or
she
is
at
the
door,
sniff
and
sit
or
sniff
and
not
sit,
or
does
the
dog
--
i
mean,
you've
talked
about
the
sniff
is
immediate.
what
--
what
is
the
5
to
10
minutes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
whole
process
is
--
is
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
take
the
5
to
10
minutes
to
walk
to
the
door.
so
the
officer
walks
to
the
door,
the
dog
sniffs
right
away
and
then?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
in
the
--
where
in
the
record
do
i
find
the
few
seconds
point?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
blumberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
were
the
mothballs
there
for?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay,
then--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
my
question.
are
we
talking
about
the
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
marijuana
or
the
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
odor?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
well,
no,
that
can't
be
right,
because
if
you're
letting
smoke
out
that
--
that
--
i
don't
know,
from
the
burning
of
a
body
or
something,
you
don't
say,
well,
because
he's
trying
to
conceal
that
you
can't
rely
on
the
smoke.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
guess
the
question
here
is,
if
you
appreciate
the
fact
that
the
odor
is
coming
out
to
the
extent
that
you're
going
to
put
mothballs
all
around
the
house,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
--
you
may
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
marijuana
plants,
but
you
don't
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
odor,
because
you're
emitting
it
out,
out
into
the
world,
and
it's
the
odor
that
was
detected.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
like
saying
you
put
the
--
the
drugs
in
a
--
in
a
bag
to
protect
them
from
observation
on
the
outside,
but
you
use,
you
know,
a
clear
bag
rather
than
a,
you
know,
opaque
one
or
something.
you
didn't
--
you
weren't
very
successful.
and
--
when
you
began
you
said
assuming
that's
what
the
mothballs
were
there
for.
that
is
what
they
were
there
for,
isn't
it?
there
is
no
other
reason--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
our
fourth
amendment
cases
are
very
clear
that
they
don't
turn
on
the
subjective
intent
of
the
particular
officer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
just
said
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
he's
going
up
to
the
door
to
sniff
or
going
up
for
something
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
sure,
if
he's
down
on
his
knees;
but,
what
if
he
goes
up
to
the
front
door
and
sniffs?
i
mean,
he's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--he's
got
to
breathe.
i
mean,
how
do
you
tell
whether
it's
different?
i
don't
understand.
he's
going
up
to
drop
off,
you
know,
tickets
to
the
policeman's
ball,
and
he
smells
marijuana.
what
is
that?
is
that
a
violation
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
depends
on
--
but
if
he's
going
up
to
sniff,
it
is
a
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
odors
be
in
the
equivalent
of
plain
sight,
plain
smell?
in
other
words,
the
officer
goes
up
to
drop
off
the
policeman's
ball
tickets,
the
door
is
open,
he
sees
the
dead
body.
the
officer
goes
up
to
sell
the
policeman's
ball
tickets,
and
he
sees
--
he
smells
the
marijuana.
okay
in
both
cases,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
depends
upon
how
strong
the
odor
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
--
let's
say
it's
a
townhouse
that
goes
right
up
to
the
sidewalk.
if
the
police
go
by
with
their
dog
intending
to
sniff,
and
the
dog
alerts,
on
the
sidewalk
but
two
feet
away
is
the
front
door,
that's
okay,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
okay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
you.
the
policeman
is
walking
down
the
sidewalk
with
his
dog,
the
dog
stops
and
alerts.
that
doesn't
constitute
sufficient
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant
to
go
into
the
townhouse.
there's
been
no
entry
onto
the
property,
just
a
policeman
walking
with
his
dog.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he's
walking
the
dog.
he's
not
out
searching.
he's
walking
the
k-9
dog,
and
the
dog
alerts
on
a
house
without
any
trespass.
you
think
that's
still
bad?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
constitutionally
protected
area
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
though
it's
the
sidewalk
where
people
--
there's
an
implied
license
for
people
to
walk
up
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
it's
the
front
part.
but
there
is
an
implied
license
to
walk
up
to
the
front
door,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
this
is
the
same
question
justice
alito
asked
earlier,
but
people
have
different
senses
of
smell.
so
what
if
there
is
some
person
who
has,
you
know,
the
best
sense
of
smell
in
the
department,
and
they
say,
well,
let's
use
him
to
go
do
the
knock
and
talks
when
we
suspect
drugs;
that
way,
he
may
discover
the
odor
of
marijuana
when
other
people
wouldn't.
is
it
--
is
it
--
is
it
wrong
for
them
to
select
the
person
with
the
best
sense
of
smell
to
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
do
a
knock
and
talk.
you
said
knock
and
talks
are
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
garre,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
11-564,
florida
versus
jardines.
