justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
that
just
can't
be
a
proposition
that
we
can
accept
across
the
board.
nobody
under
that
view
has
an
interest
in
contraband
in
their
home.
the
question
is,
can
you
find
out
the
contraband?
it's
just
a
circular
argument.
and
if
--
and
in
the
--
was
it
the
caballes
case
that
talked
about
that,
if
i
have
the
right
name?
that
was
where
the
contraband
was
visible;
it
was
almost
like
the
smoking
gun
falls
out.
well,
of
course,
there's
no
interest
in
the
smoking
gun
when
it
falls
out
in
front
of
you.
so
i
just
don't
think
that
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
--
again,
as
i
told
mr.
garre,
i
just
can't
accept
that
as
the
premise
for
the
case.
the
argument
we're
having
about
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
in
society
generally,
whether
or
not
the
police
because
of
limited
resources
are
not
going
to
have
--
that's
all
fine.
but
this
idea
that,
oh,
well,
if
there
is
contraband,
then
all
the
--
all
the
rules
go
out
the
window,
that's
just
circular,
and
it
won't
work
for
me,
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
fine--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
don't
ask
me
to
write
an
opinion
and
say,
oh,
we're
dealing
with
contraband
here,
so
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
expectation
of
privacy.
there
is
simply
no
support
for
that
because
caballes
cited
jacobsen,
and
jacobsen
was
where
the
contraband
fell
out
of
the
package
and
it
was
in
plain
view.
so
that
just
doesn't
work,
at
least
for
me,
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
again,
i
don't
think
the
cases
go
that
far
because
those
were
cases
in
which
the
contraband
--
jacobsen
--
was
in
plain
view.
everybody
knows
that
it
falls
out
of
the
package.
at
that
point,
you
don't
have
any--
what
you're
saying
is,
oh,
well,
if
there
is
contraband
in
the
house,
then
you
have
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
that,
for
me,
does
not
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
fine.
we
can
talk
about
reasonable
suspicion.
that's
all
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
your
first
reason
and
i
don't
want
you
to
be
deterred
from
giving
us
the
second,
but
if
we
can
concentrate
on
that
for
a
minute.
that
seems
to
me
a
proposition
that's
equally
unacceptable
to
what
the
government
is
saying,
that
you
have
no
interest
in
contraband.
the
police
often,
when
they
have
ordinary
conversation
with
people,
want
to
find
out
the
details
of
what
that
person
is
doing,
where
the
person
lives,
what
goes
on
in
the
house.
"hello,
have
you
had
a
nice
time
at
the
--
at
the
park
today?
"
"i
see
you're
coming
home
with
your
children;
is
this
where
you
live?
"
this
is
all
routine
conversation
that
we
always
have
in
order
to
try
to
find
out
what
people
are
doing,
what
they
are
like,
where
they
live.
so
i
--
i
think
the
statement,
and
you
--
you
repeated
it
quite
accurately
from
what
you
have
at
page
16
of
your
brief
--
just
goes
too
far.
our
decisions
"establish
that
police
action
which
reveals
any
detail
an
individual
seeks
to
keep
private
is
a
search.
"
--that
is
just
a
sweeping
proposition
that
in
my
view,
at
least,
cannot
be
accepted
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
just
too
sweeping
and
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
police
officer
talked
with
somebody
at
the
police
station,
or
walking
down
the
street
about
what
their
occupation
is,
do
they
work
at
home.
they're
--
they
are
trying
to
get
information.
that's
perfectly
legitimate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
your
broad
statement
simply
does
not
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
i
was
going
to
ask
for
your
second,
your
second
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
is
that
different
from
what
justice
breyer
i
think
correctly
indicated,
our
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?
in
a
way,
that's
circular
because
if
we
say
there
is,
then
there
is,
if
we
say
there
isn't,
then
there
isn't.
but
if
we're
looking
at
community
values
in
general,
isn't
it
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
this.
i
think
i
know
what
your
answer
would
be.
suppose
the
policemen
have
little
microphones
on
so
they
can
talk
into
their
radio,
the
microphone
on
their
lapel.
suppose
the
policeman
goes
to
the
homeowner
and
he
has
the
microphone
in
his
lapel
on
so
his
partner
can
hear
the
conversation,
and
they
can
--
the
two
of
them
talk
about
it
later.
they're
talking
to
the
homeowner.
is
that
an
unlawful
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
occur
to
him
that
that
mike
is
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
maybe
it
is
a
reasonable
expectation,
maybe
it
isn't.
i
frankly
think
that
might
be
harder
than
the
dog
case
or
that
you
can
make
a
stronger
case
for
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if
the
--
if
the
homeowner
is
making
a
lot
of
marijuana
with
--
with
odors
coming
out,
he
knows
that
a
dog
or
a
person
might
smell
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
hinge
on
what
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
what
we're
trying
to
find
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
