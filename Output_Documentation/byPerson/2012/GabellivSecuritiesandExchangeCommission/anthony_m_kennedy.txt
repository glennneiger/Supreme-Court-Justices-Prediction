justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
justice
ginsburg
points
out
that
you're
talking
about
the
statute,
but
the
statute
uses
the
term
“
accrual
”.
is
it
correct
to
say
the
term
“
accrual
”
is
not
used
in
statute
of
limitations
for
crimes
--
generally
--
for
crimes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
and
this
--
and
this
talks
about
accrual.
so
that
is
indicative
--
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
congress
is
using
a
civil
analogue
in
the
drafting
of
this
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
a
civil
--
in
a
civil
action
brought
by
an
injured
investor
or
private
party,
can
that
plaintiff,
the
injured
investor,
the
private
party,
in
the
ordinary
course
plead
and
rely
upon
an
earlier
government
determination
that
there
had
been
a
violation
and
so
that
that's
presumptive
showing
of
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
sec
makes
an
investigation,
find
a
violation;
can
a
private
investor
then
rely
on
that
as
a
presumptive
showing
of
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
not
the
allegation.
it's
an
ultimate
finding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
under
your
rule.
the
plaintiff
would
be
deprived
of
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
government's
statute
of
limitations
runs
out
and
the
private
investor
is
on
his
own,
then
the
private
investor
doesn't
have
the
advantage
that
exists
in
other
cases
of
reliance
on
an
sec
finding
as
a
presumptive
showing
of
liability.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
cases
discussing
whether
or
not
a
government
agency
has
been
diligent
in
pursuing
a
fraud,
a
fraud
investigation?
you
see,
in
the
private
context
we
have
some
sense
of
what
the
plaintiff
has
to
do
to
protect
the
plaintiff's
rights.
he
has
to
be
diligent.
but
to
transpose
that
to
a
governmental
agency
--
suppose
the
agency's
overworked
or
underfunded?
i
don't
--
which
way
do
you
come
out
when
the
government
says
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
perhaps
i've
missed
something.
i
--
i
came
in
here
thinking
that
both
parties
were
willing
to
concede
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
there
was
a
fraudulent
concealment.
is
that
--
is
that
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
for
purposes
of
presenting
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
that's
before
us.
