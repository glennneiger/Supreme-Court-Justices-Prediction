mr.
lewis
j.
liman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
statute
dealing
exclusively
with
penalty
claims
brought
by
government
agencies
to
punish
conduct
made
unlawful
by
statute.
congress
provided
a
clear
and
easily
administered
statutory
time
limitation
on
the
government's
power
to
punish:
5
years,
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
congress.
the
case
does
not
concern
--
the
statute
does
not
concern
the
government's
power
to
seek
remedial
remedies
such
as
disgorgement
and
injunction.
consistent
with
congress's
normal
approach
in
penal
situations,
congress
fixed
a
statute
of
limitations
for
penalties.
the
court
below,
for
the
first
time
over
the
century
the
statute
has
been
in
existence,
sweepingly
concluded
that
unless
congress
clearly
directed
otherwise,
the
statute
and
the
5
years
did
not
begin
to
run
from
the
time
the
defendant
violated
the
law,
the
ordinary
rule
for
statutes
providing
for
accrual,
but
instead--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
is
that
the
court
doesn't
need
to
decide,
congress
has
decided.
congress
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
rule
of
accrual
applied
to
all
penalty
claims.
and
as
this
court
held
in
clark
v.
martinez,
the
same
word
in
a
statute
cannot
be
given
different
interpretations
depending
on
the
underlying
statute
to
which
it
is
applied.
the
second
reason,
though,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
it
is
not
correct
to
say
--
and
this
court
has
never
said
--
that
either
the
bailey
rule
or
the
injury
accrual
rule
applies
to
a
statutory
fraud
claim
where
the
government
is
seeking
to
punish.
that
would--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--for
--
for
crimes,
the
general
word
that
is
used
is
time
period
from
the
violation.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
your
honor,
it
indicates
that
congress
is
using
accrual
as
it
is
understood
at
common
law.
common
law,
it
means
when
the
claim
becomes
ripe
and
the
plaintiff
has
the
ability
to
sue.
what
that
means
is,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
said
in
3m
--
and
we
think
the
d.c.
circuit
got
it
right
on
this
--
that
you
look
to
the
underlying
statute
pursuant
to
which
the
government
is
seeking
a
penalty
to
see
when
the
claim
became
ripe.
in
a
penalty
situation,
and
under
the
iaa,
which
is
what
this
concerns
--
it
doesn't
concern
a
common
law
fraud
claim;
it
doesn't
concern
a
claim
where
there's
even
any
element
of
deception
that's
required.
it's
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
what
the
iaa
says
is
that
the
government
can
sue
when
the
violation
occurs.
now--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--justice
sotomayor,
let
me
give
you
the
precise
answer
to
that,
which
is
that
in
this
case
where
the
government
is
seeking
a
penalty,
it
is
not
acting
on
behalf
of
underlying
investors,
and
the
recovery
is
not
one
that
is
brought
by
way
of
damages
or
disgorgement.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
the
articulation
that
the
government
would
have
to
make.
i
don't
think
it
holds
up,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
would
represent
an
extreme
departure
from
anything
this
court
has
ever
held
or,
to
our
knowledge,
any
court
has
ever
held
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
discovery
rule.
second,
when
you're
talking
about
penalty,
you're
not
talking
about
recovery
to
victims.
third,
when
we're
talking
about
implying
a
rule,
which
is
what
the
government's
argument
is
here
--
it's
not
an
argument
to
follow
the
plain
language,
it's
an
argument
to
depart
from
the
plain
language
--
you
should
look
at,
and
the
cases
direct
you
to
look
at
the
policy
concerns.
and
when
you're
talking
about
discover
--
a
discovery
rule
with
respect
to
the
government
as
enforcer,
the
rules
don't
work.
they
don't
work
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
when
you've
got
an
injury,
a
party
who
is
injured,
the
statute
of
limitations
has
a
natural
start
date
that
is
not
in
control
of
the
plaintiff.
there
is
a
relationship
to
the
underlying
violation.
and
that
can
be
readily
measured.
none
of
that
is
true
when
you're
talking
about
the
government
in
a
law
enforcement
capacity.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
justice
kagan,
i've
got
two
answers
to
that
question
as
well.
the
first
is
that
--
that
i
don't
think
is
the
basis
for
--
for
the
discovery
rule
at
bottom.
the
basis
for
the
discovery
rule
--
if
you
look
at
this
court's
opinion
in
rotella,
if
you
look
at
the
seventh
circuit
in
cada,
the
d.c.
circuit
in
connor
--
is
the
notion
that
when
the
plaintiff
cannot
discover
the
injury,
doesn't
know
that
it's
been
injured
and
cannot
reasonably
know
that
the
plaintiff's
been
injured,
the
plaintiff
cannot
take
the
steps
that
other
plaintiffs
would
take
to
investigate
and
determine
whether
they've
got
a
cause
of
action.
that's
not
applicable
in
a
government
enforcement
context,
because
you're
not
talking
about
there
the
government
as
a
victim.
the
government
may
not
know
of
the
underlying
transaction,
will
not
know
of
the
underlying
transaction,
unless
the
government
asks.
the
second
reason
is
that
there
is
a
strain
that
--
in
the
bailey
line
of
cases
--
that
really
speaks
in
terms
of
equitable
tolling
and
fraudulent
concealment,
that
sort
of
a
notion
of
unclean
hands.
that's
not
in
this
case,
because
the
government
affirmatively
took
it
out.
but
we
would
submit--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--that's
not
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
if
you'd
look
at
the
--
at
the
opinion
below
and
you
look
at
the
complaint,
the
essence
of
the
allegation
which
we
have
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
disprove
before
you
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
that
there
were
misrepresentations
and
omissions
made
to
the
board
of
the
mutual
fund.
there
was
no
misrepresentations
made
to
the
investing
public.
that
allegation
is
not
in
the
complaint.
it
would
not
be
accurate.
and
there
is
no
allegation
whatsoever
that
anything
was
hidden
from
the
government
or
was
in
any
way
concealed
from
the
government.
the
records
here
would
have
been
available
--
were
available
for
the
government
to
look
at,
at
any
time.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
your
honor,
i
think
you
could
and
should
conclude
that
if
you
reach
that
issue.
i
don't
think
you
need
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
our
theory
doesn't
require
you
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
your
honor,
in
the
--
using
the
same
type
of
theory
and
the
same
methodology
that
the
court
employed
in
the
rico
context
in
the
claire
case
and
in
the
rotella
case,
one
can
read
the
statute,
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
statute,
here
to
say
that
“
accrue
”
means
accrue.
it's
the
time
that
the
government
can
first
sue.
that
does
not
necessarily
resolve
the
question
of
whether
there
are
equitable
exceptions
that
the
government
or
any
party
could
affirmatively
assert
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations,
not
to
delay
the
accrual
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
that's--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--your
honor,
respectfully,
we
think
that's
not
odd
at
all.
if
you
look
in
the
securities
context,
there
is
a
5-year
statute
of
repose.
and
it
would
be
odd
to
think
that
the
same
congress
that
passed
that
5-year
statute
of
repose
limiting
even
the
ability
of
an
injured
plaintiff
without
the
tools
of
the
government
to
bring
a
private
suit
for
damages,
that's
the--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--that's
--
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
under
title
28
1658(b)
the
5
years
runs
from
the
time
of
the
violation.
it's
exactly
coextensive
2462,
and
it's
not
an
accident
that
it's
exactly
coextensive.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
we
are
not
challenging
the
disgorgement
in
front
of
this
court,
and
if
this
court
reverses
the
second
circuit
that
issue
will
remain
in
the
case
and
the
sec's
claim
for
disgorgement
will
remain,
and
that's
really
been
the
way--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--2462
applies
exclusively
with
respect
to
penalties,
fines
and
forfeitures.
it
does
not
apply
with
respect
to
equitable
remedies.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
there
is
none.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
there
is
a
social
security
statute
that--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--yes.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
i
don't
know
about
veterans
affairs.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
social
security,
there
is
an
underlying
statute--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--the
answer
is
yes.
the
answer
is
yes.
it
applies
to
a
broad
range
of
statutes
unless
congress
otherwise
provided.
in
fact,
there
are
very
few
penalty
statutes
to
which
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
it
does
apply
to
a
number
of
defense
department
statutes.
i'm
hesitating--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--i'm
not
sure
on
antitrust.
but
i
believe
that
it
applies
to
--
it
does
apply
to
a
number
of
unfair
trade
practices.
antitrust,
there
may
be
a
separate
statute.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
ftc,
yes.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
one
of
the
notable
features,
justice
breyer,
is
that
if
you
look
across
the
u.s.
code,
the
government
makes
a
point
of
saying:
well,
congress
uses
penalty
--
acknowledges
that
congress
has
used
penalty
when
--
the
word
“
penalty
”
when
the
congress
has
--
i'm
sorry,
it
has
used
the
word
“
discovery
”
when
congress
has
wanted
the
statute
to--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
this
--
this
court
has
held
in
the
lampf
case
that
bailey
and
holmberg
do
not
apply
to
securities
fraud
case.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
well,
in
lampf
it
was
1-year
and
3-year.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
and
in
the
merck
case,
the
court
made
clear
that
the
5
years
was
the
statute
of
--
the
statute
of
repose.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
yes.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
yes.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
yes,
justice
kagan.
and
we
don't
think
that's
an
anomaly.
we
don't
think
it's
an
anomaly
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
the
private
context,
as
again
i
mentioned,
the
statute,
the
start
date
for
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
in
the
control
of
the
plaintiff.
that's
a
critical
point.
it's
critical
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
from
hubrick
forward.
it
--
there
is
a
natural
start
date
from
when
the
injury
would
be
known
to
a
reasonable
plaintiff.
not
true
with
respect
to
the
government,
who
may
not
even
know
of
the
transaction.
but
what
it
--
so
it's
--
i
don't
think
there's
an
anomaly
because
there
are
different
statutes
of
limitation.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
number
one,
it
does.
and
number
two,
the
relief
being
sought
in
exploration
was
the
cancellation
of
a
patent,
so
it
was
the
government
as
a
party
to
a
transaction.
and
what
the
court
really
said
in
exploration,
what
the
court,
in
fact,
said
in
exploration,
is
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
same
rule
applied
the
same
way
couldn't
benefit
the
government
as
well
as
the
private
plaintiff.
what
the
government
is
seeking
here
is
not
the
same
rule
and
would
not
be
applied
in
the
same
way,
because
you
are
talking
about
a
transaction
that
is
a,
frankly,
a
private
transaction
that
there
is
no
reason
that
the
government
would
know
anything
about.
the
claim
ultimately
here
is
a
claim
about
what
was
said
in
a
private
conversation
between
the
advisor
to
a
mutual
fund
and
the
mutual
fund
--
fund
board.
so
exploration,
what's
notable
is
that
the
government
doesn't
cite
a
single
case
where
the
discovery
rule
has
been
applied
to
a
party
who
is
not
a
victim
or
that
it's
been
applied
--
where
it's
been
applied
and
a
penalty
hasn't
been
--
a
penalty
has
been
at
issue.
i
mean,
neither
of
those
circumstances.
we
are
talking
about
a
statute
ultimately
where
the
plain
language
is
clear
and
the
government
is
invoking
a
statutory
canon
not
to
try
to
interpret
language
of
the
statute,
not
even
to
fill
a
gap
in
a
statute,
but
to
override
it.
the
canon
that
they
say
overrides
the
plain
language
doesn't
exist.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
your
honor--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--yeah.
i
think
the
lower
courts
are
mixed
on
the
extent
to
which
you
can
rely
upon
the
actual
allegations
in
a
complaint.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
absolutely.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
under
our
rule
the
plaintiff
has
exactly
the
same
rights
regardless
of
how
this
case
is
determined.
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action
will
turn
upon
the
underlying--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--your
honor,
that
--
that
--
our
argument
only
applies
with
respect
to
penalty.
the
government
has
huge
powers
with
respect
to
disgorgement
and
injunctive
relief.
so
if
the
government
believes
that
there
is
a
wrongdoing,
the
government
still
has
the
ability
to
bring
a
claim
and
the
private
investors
still
have
the
ability
to
rely
upon
the
government's
enforcement
action
and
whatever
findings
come
out
of
that.
so
there
is
nothing
in
our
argument
that
diminished
to
any
degree
the
recovery
abilities
of
a
private
plaintiff.
in
fact,
as
we've
highlighted,
that
5-year
period
for
the
--
in
the
securities
laws
puts
a
premium
on
the
sec
acting
promptly.
and
i
would
note
that
that's
something
that
is
not
accidental.
if
you
go
back
in
the
legislative
history
and
look
to
the
sec's
reaction
to
the
lampf
decision,
the
sec
urged
a
5-year
statute
of
repose,
saying
that
that
struck
in
the
private
context
the
right
balance
between
repose
when
you're
dealing
with
complex
commercial
transactions
and
enforcement
and
--
and
recovery.
there's
--
the
position
that
the
sec
is
taking
now
is
a
novel
position
that
to
our
knowledge
has
not
been
taken
by
other
regulators
and
hasn't
been
taken
by
the
sec
until
--
until
quite
recently.
this
statute's
been
on
the
books
for
quite
a
long
time,
and
it's
notable
that
agencies
have
not
urged
that
--
that
interpretation.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg.
i
missed
the
question.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
there
are
statutes
that
use
that
kind
of
language,
and
that's
precisely
our
point,
because
it
reflects
that
congress
recognizes
the
difference
and
could,
if
congress
wanted,
provide
that
a
claim
for
the
violation
of
the
iaa
or
for
any
other
statute
accrues
when
it
is
discovered.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
just
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
whether
this
is
a
criminal
penalty
and
whether
the
rules
of
lenity
apply,
this
court
has
held
in
the
commissioner
v.
ackerly
case
that
the
rule
of
lenity
applies
to
civil
penalties.
just
as
an--
mr.
lewis
j.
liman
--i
believe
it's
commissioner
against
ackerly.
it's
cited
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
second,
the
concession
that
you
just
heard
a
moment
ago,
that
the
statute
would
not
apply
as
the
government
says
it
should
apply
if
this
was
deemed
to
be
a
criminal
penalty,
we
submit
under
this
court's
reasoning
in
clark
v.
martinez,
it
just
gave
away
the
store
in
the
government's
case,
because
if
it
is
possible
--
if
the
government
has
now
admitted
it's
possible
--
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
all
of
the
permutations
of
hudson
--
but
if
it
is
possible
that
the
label
of
civil
penalty
does
not
--
is
not
dispositive
as
to
whether
a
penalty
is
civil
or
criminal,
then,
as
the
court
held
in
clark
v.
martinez,
the
lowest
common
denominator
applies.
one
has
to
interpret
this
statute
so
that
it
is
applicable
across
the
range
of
statutes.
and
if
that's
so,
then
it
follows,
it
runs
from
accrual
as
that
word
is
commonly
understood.
next
point.
the
government
said
that
there
are
no
cases
where
the
court
considered
the
claim
that
it
is
making.
we
would
point
the
court's
attention
to
the
rotella
case,
in
which
in
the
context
of
a
private
plaintiff
who
did
not
have
the
resources
of
the
government,
the
argument
was
made
that
the
rico
statute
should
have
a
discovery
of
the
violation
type
principle.
and
the
argument
was
made
there
that
rico
can
encompass
a
pattern
of
fraudulent
acts.
and
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
said,
as
the
government
says
here,
fraud
can
be
concealed,
can
be
complex,
can
be
difficult
to
discover.
and
the
court
unanimously
had
a
response
to
that.
the
response
was
that,
at
least
as
soon
as
you
know
the
injury,
where
there
is
an
injury
element,
the
difficulty
of
discovery
of
the
actual
violation
doesn't
defer
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
government
also
argued
that
the
problems
of
privilege
are
not
significant
ones.
we
would
point
the
court's
attention
to
the
joint
appendix
in
the
second
circuit,
where
the
government
asserted
privilege
with
respect
to
our
questions
about
its
investigations
of
the
counterparty
to
this
alleged
quid
pro
quo.
the
court
also
asked
a
question
of
whether
there
are
any
cases
in
which
courts
have
dealt
with
government
agencies
being
diligent,
and
the
claim
being
the
government
agency
was
not
diligent.
the
court
has
dealt
with
that
in
a
related
context,
in
the
heckler
v.
cheney
context.
and
in
the
heckler
v.
cheney
context
the
court
held
that
that
type
of
issue,
how
an
administrative
agency
treats
facts
that
are
--
that
it
discovers
and
whether
it
chooses
to
bring
a
claim
or
not,
whether
it
chooses
to
believe
that
they
are
in
violation
of
a
statute,
the
agency
is
charged
with
administering
is
not
fit
for
judicial
review.
no
different
result
should
apply
here.
just
two
more
points.
the
false
claims
act
has
a
--
which
has
an
explicit
discovery
rule,
also
has
a
statute
of
repose.
it
would
be
very
odd,
indeed,
if
the
one
circumstance
where
congress,
one
of
the
few
circumstances
where
congress
chose
to
use
the
word
“
discovery
”,
was
where
the
government
was
injured,
and
congress
chose
to
impose
a
statute
of
repose,
where,
as
they
say
in
the
100
or
other
statutes
that
use
language,
fraud-like
language,
congress
intended
there
to
be
discovery
and
no
repose.
and
that
really
ties
into
the
last
point,
which
is
that
there
are
by
our
count
if
you
look
at
fraud,
misleading,
false
statement-type
statutes,
there
are
somewhere
like
80
or
100-type
statutes
that
use
that
kind
of
language
that
would
be
applicable
if
this
court
affirms
the
second
circuit.
this
case
was
in
--
the
government
says
this
case
was
an
outlier.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
this
case
will
remain
an
outlier.
thank
you.
