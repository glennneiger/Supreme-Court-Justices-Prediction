justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
liman,
i
understand
your
argument,
but
i
have
a
fundamental
difficulty,
okay?
bailey
and
exploration
company,
with
statutes
not
too
dissimilar
from
this
one,
who
read
the
discovery
rule
into
a
fraud
claim,
both
were
a
civil
litigant
and
for
the
government.
the
only
way
that
i
can
tease
out
a
potential
difference
between
exploration
and
this
case
is
somehow
that
the
penalty
in
this
case
is
not
for
injury
but
for
punishment,
as
you
called
it.
government
as
enforcer,
rather
than
government
as
victim.
some
of
us
would
say
that
the
common
wheel
is
injured
whenever
someone
breaks
a
law,
so
that
that
distinction
between
enforcer
and
victim
makes
no
sense.
how
do
you
answer
that
point?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
acting
as
a
sovereign
to
protect
what
it
thinks
is
an
ordered
society.
and
if
you
break
that
order,
you
are
injuring
the
society.
that's
the
best--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
liman,
finishing
up
a
point
you
were
just
on
previously,
what's
your
position
with
respect
to
fraudulent
concealment?
doesn't
your
theory
preclude
even
the
application
of
that
to
tolling
of
the
statute?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
tell
me
about--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--this
is
--
it's
nice
for
you
to
say
that.
but
tell
me,
having
announced
your
theory,
how
the
next
step
is
avoidable?
under
what
theory
would
we
say
you
can't
have
a
discovery
rule,
but
you
can
have
a
fraudulent
concealment
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
liman,
i'm
a
little
confused
in
your
answer
to
justice
scalia.
you
said
that
the
underlying
case
has
a
5-year
statute
of
repose
for
a
civil
claim.
it
barely
applies,
however,
those
claimants
who
have
--
under
your
theory,
who
have
been
directly
injured.
the
presumption
would
apply
of
discovery,
if
they
were
claiming
a
fraud.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
just
arguing
that
under
this
statutory
scheme
there
is
no
application
of
the
discovery?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
of
the
alternative
language
of
5
years.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
i
thought
those
involved.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
a
very
modern
problem,
but
how
about
the
statute
of
elizabeth,
which
talked
about
penalties
as
being
a
criminal
sanction
but
permitted
private
individuals,
not
the
government,
to
seek
the
penalties
and
keep
it.
so
you
cite
the
statute
of
james
and
i
look
at
the
statute
of
elizabeth
and
try
to
find
the
analogy
between
which
one.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
though
private
parties
could
keep
the
money
back
then.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
move
you
to
another
issue?
if
a
party
can
defeat
the
government's
claim
of
discovery
by
showing
that
the
government
wasn't
reasonably
diligent,
how
does
a
party
ever
accomplish
that?
aren't
you
going
to
raise
the
law
enforcement
privilege,
the
--
some
other
privilege
to
block
discovery?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
if
they
fail
there,
don't
you
think
that
they
are
going
to
also
fail
because
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
look
at
your
records
to
figure
out
exactly
what
you
knew
or
didn't
know?
