justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
liman.
mr.
liman,
you
--
you
are
typing
this
a
penalty
case.
the
government
says
the
accrual
is
the
ordinary
rule,
but
discovery
is
the
rule
in
this
court,
and
so
it
is
alleged
here.
so
how
does
the
court
decide
whether
to
type
this
case
a
penalty
case,
as
you
urge,
or
a
fraud
case,
as
the
government
urged
--
urges,
when
both
captions
fit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
did
the
government
take
it
out?
i
mean,
the
point
here
is
that
there
was
a
concealment.
there
was
a
hiding
of
what
was
the
impermissible
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
liman,
how
does
it
work
with
a
disgorgement
remedy?
i
take
it
that
that's
still
--
that
you
are
not
challenging
the
disgorgement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
apply
--
you
don't
say
it's
too
late
for
them
to
sue
for
disgorgement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
there
any
statute
of
limitations
on
disgorgement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
no
statutes,
mr.
liman,
that
say
the
claim
accrues
when
the
injury
is
discovered,
that
use
both,
both
terms?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
no
statutes
that
use
both
terms,
“
accrues
”
and
“
discovery
”?
a
statute,
for
example,
that
says:
this
claim
accrues
when
the
injury
is
discovered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it
is
a
generous
period.
it's
5
years.
and,
mr.
wall,
maybe
you
can
explain
the
sec's
pursuit
of
this
--
of
this
case.
the
alleged
fraud
went
on
from
1999
to
2002.
it
was
discovered
in
2003.
the
sec
waited
from
2003
to
2008
to
commence
suit.
what
--
what
is
the
reason
for
--
for
the
delay
from
the
time
of
discovery
till
the
time
suit
is
instituted?
