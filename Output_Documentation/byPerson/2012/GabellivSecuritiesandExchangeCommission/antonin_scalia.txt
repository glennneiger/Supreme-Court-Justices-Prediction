mr.
liman,
you
acknowledge
that
a
civil
action
could
be
brought
beginning
from
the
time
when
the
injured
plaintiff
discovers
the
fraud,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
really
not
arguing
for
what
you
might
call
a
total
statute
of
repose.
it
seems
to
me
odd
that
the
defendant
would
be
relieved
from
prosecution
by
the
government,
but
not
relieved
from
a
suit
for
sometimes
very
substantial
damages
by
--
by
an
injured
plaintiff
who
doesn't
have
to
sue
until
he's
discovered
the
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
but
that
5
years
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
the
private
plaintiff
discovers
the
fraud,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
the
common
law
held
that
it
didn't
accrue.
i
think
it
was
an
exception
to
the
accrual
rule,
that,
even
though
it
accrued
earlier,
we
are
going
to
allow
a
later
suit
where
--
where
discovery
is
made
later.
is
that
the
way
those
cases
were
framed,
that
it
didn't
accrue
until
discovery?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
are
making
the
argument,
so
you
ought
to
fight
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
never
in
a
criminal
case,
right?
do
you
have
a
single
case
in
which
the
discovery
rule
was
--
was
applied
in
a
criminal
case
with
respect
to
a
penalty
or
a
criminal
sanction?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
single
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
expect
that
--
you'd
expect
there
to
be
some
cases
in
a
couple
of
hundred
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
fraud
is
nothing
new,
for
pete's
sake.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
brand-new
assertion
by
the
government
that
--
tell
--
is
there
much
difference
between
the
rule
you
are
arguing
for
and
a
rule
that
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
matter
of
there
being
nothing
on
either
side
of
the
ledger.
what's
extraordinary
is
that
the
government
has
never
asserted
this,
except
in
the
19th
century,
when
it
was
rebuffed
and
repudiated
its
position.
it
isn't
just
that
there
are
no
cases
against
you.
it's
you've
never
--
the
government
has
never
asserted
it
before.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
false
claims
act
example
you
give
is
indeed
a
private
plaintiff
kind
of
a
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
can
say
the
government,
having
been
cheated,
should
have
known
it
was
cheated.
but
we
are
talking
here
about
prosecution,
essentially,
prosecution
for
a
civil
penalty
rather
than
a
criminal.
by
the
way,
doesn't
the
rule
of
lenity
apply
whether
the
penalty
is
criminal
or
civil?
so
if
i
think
the
word
“
accrual
”
is
at
best
ambiguous,
shouldn't
the
tie
go
to
the
defendant?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
my
question
is
broader
than
that.
does
the
rule
of
lenity
not
apply
to
all
penalties?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
of
that?
my
belief
is
the
contrary.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
an
important
issue
in
this
case
surely.
i
mean,
if
“
accrual
”
is
ambiguous
and
we
have
a
rule
of
lenity,
we
should
interpret
it
to
favor
the
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
concede
that
there
was
fraudulent
concealment.
all
he
conceded
is
that
there
was
fraud,
but
later
concealment
to
cover
up
that
fraud
i
don't
think
has
been
conceded.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
concealment
is
sort
--
you
know,
it's
sort
of
a
self-starter.
you
--
you
--
it
--
it
doesn't
apply
always.
it
applies
when
there
is
concealment,
and
the
person
who
is
being
subjected
to
the
longer
statute
of
limitations
is
on
notice
that
if
he
fraudulently
conceals,
he's
extending
the
statute.
so
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
one
has
to
go
with
the
other.
maybe
they're
both
equitable
doctrines,
but
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
have
to
apply
them
to
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
for
300
years,
that
has
been
said
only
with
respect
to
civil
actions,
not
with
respect
to
the
government's
attempt
to
exact
a
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
will
say
nonsense
in
that
future
case,
won't
you?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
criminal
penalties?
would
your
argument
be
different
with
regard
to
criminal?
justice
antonin
scalia
incidentally,
what
makes
something
a
civil
penalty?
you
just
call
it
a
civil
penalty
and
you
don't
have
to
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
you
get
the
benefit
of
this
extension
that
you
are
arguing
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
makes
a
penalty
a
civil
penalty?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
a
penalty
is
a
penalty
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
if
the
government's
taking
money
from
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
nice.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
my
point,
that
it
is
criminal.
my
point
is,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
as
far
as
these
issues
are
concerned.
