mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
justice
kennedy
started
us
off
in
the
right
place
by
focusing
on
the
statute
and
its
use
of
the
term
“
accrual
”.
and
when
counsel
concedes
that
that
term
had
an
established
meaning
at
common
law
and
this
statute
picks
it
up,
i
think
he
gave
away
his
case,
because
there
were
a
cluster
of
concepts.
one
was
the
general
rule
governing
accrual:
it
accrues
when
the
plaintiff
can
--
has
a
right
to
sue.
but
there
was
a
specific
principle
for
cases
of
fraud
and
concealment.
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
in
law
or
logic
for
petitioner
saying
that
this
statute
meant
to
pick
up
one
of
those
concepts
and
not
the
other
concept.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
i
don't
want
to
fight
about
it
too
much
because
from
the
government's
perspective,
it
doesn't
matter--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--it
doesn't
matter
how
it's
labeled.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
we
label
it
as
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
or
an
exception
for
cases
of
fraud
or
concealment.
the
result
is
the
same.
but
i
will
say
you
are
right,
in
some
cases
it
was
described
as
an
exception,
but
as
long
ago
as
kirby
in
1887
and
as
recently
as
merck--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no,
not
in--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
no.
the
criminal
context
is
fundamentally
different.
this
court
has
said
that
those
statutes
are
construed
liberally
in
favor
of
repose
and
are
presumptively
not
subject
to--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer,
most
or
many
of
the
penalty
claims
that
are
being
brought
under
section
2462
and
other
penalty
statutes
don't
deal
with
fraud
or
concealment,
and
i
grant
you
that
it
is--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--so
in
--
it's
a
problem
of
fairly
recent
vintage,
to
be
sure--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--and
i
guess
what
i
want
to
tell
you
is
there
aren't
cases
out
there
one
way
or
the
other.
there
aren't
cases
endorsing
or
declining
to
adopt
the
discovery
rule
in
the
context
of
fraud
or
concealment
with
civil
penalty
actions--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
it's
not
that--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--absolutely
there
is.
since
--
look.
in
1990
the
commission
was
given
the
right
to
seek
civil
penalties,
so
it
could
only
have
brought
these
actions
for
the
last
20
years.
in
those
20-plus
years,
we
have
seen
25
reported
cases
dealing
with
2462
and
civil
penalties.
in
19
of
those
cases,
the
commission
brought
its
action
within
5
years
of
the
end
of
the
fraud.
it
used
the
discovery
rule
only
to
reach
back
and
get
the
beginning
of
the
fraud.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
there
are
cases
from
the
1980s
and
1990s
dealing
with
concealment,
and
in
our
view
the
justification
is
the
same
for
concealment
as
fraud.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
on
either
side
of
the
ledger,
i
will
be
very
upfront,
other
than
the
maillard
case,
which
i
think
even
courts
at
the
time,
an
exploration
company,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
there
were
very
few
civil
penalty
actions
in
which
--
that
involved
fraud
or
concealment,
in
which
the
government
would
have
needed
to
invoke
it,
or
did
invoke
it
and
was
rebuffed
by
courts.
i
mean,
this
is
a
fairly
modern
problem,
and
the
question
is
do
all
of
the
same
concepts
that
compelled
one
answer
in
these
other
contexts
compel
the
same
answer
here
or
does
a
rule
that
blankets
the
waterfront--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
if
this
were
a
criminal
penalty,
the
government
agrees--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
right.
but
what
the
court's
been
clear
on
is
that
there
are
civil
penalties
and
there
are
criminal
penalties
and
which
side
of
the
line
it
falls
on
invokes
a
different
set
of
background
rules
and
legal
norms.
the
congress
denominated
this
as
a
civil
penalty--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
sotomayor,
discovery
is
playing
itself
out
in
cases
like
these
in
district
courts.
privilege
has
not
been
a
very
major
issue
and
the
reason
is
defendants
are
by
and
large
pointing
to
things
in
the
public
domain
--
private
lawsuits,
public
filings
with
the
commission,
public
statements
--
to
say
those
put
the
commission
on
constructive--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no,
not
invariably.
i
mean,
the
way
this
plays
itself
out
in
the
district
court
is
the
commission
says
that
it
didn't
know
and
a
defendant
points
to
something
in
the
public
domain
and
says
either
that
put
you
on
constructive
notice
or--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--mr.
chief
justice,
they
can't
point
to
a
single
case
where
it
has
been
difficult
here,
and
it
hasn't
been
difficult--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--where
it's
been
difficult
in
order
to
make
that
determination.
and
it
hasn't
proven
difficult--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
i
think
there
are
--
where
you
should
expect
those
cases
to
exist,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kennedy,
not
just
this
statute.
there
are
other
statutes,
the
false
claims
act
and
others,
that
have
specific
provisions
requiring
courts
to
determine
when
a
government
official
would
reasonably
have
been
on
notice
of
certain
circumstances.
that
hasn't
proven
difficult
in
those
contexts.
it's
not
difficult
here.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito.
i
mean,
i
think
we
could
say
that
there
might
be
circumstances
where
the
commission
would
be
on
constructive
notice
and
not
a
private
plaintiff
because
of
its
expertise.
it
would
see
something
in
the
public
domain
that
should
be
meaningful
to
it
that
might
not
be
meaningful
to
a
private
plaintiff.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no.
the
court's
been
very
--
i
mean,
in
all
of
the
civil
cases
applying
the
fraud
discovery
rule,
the
court
has
never
looked
to
the
criminal
analogies.
the
canon
here
is
that
ambiguities
get
construed
for
the
sovereign,l
not
against
it.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
don't
think
it
applies
in
the
context
of
a
civil
penalty.
i
don't
think
the
--
i
don't
think--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
can't
say
that
i
focused
on
it
specifically,
but
i
think
if
the
petitioner
said--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
--
petitioner
certainly
couldn't
claim
that
this
civil
penalty
should
have
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
i
don't
know
why
one
legal
norm
among
them
all
should
change
in
the
civil
context
and
not
the
others.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
absolutely.
there
are
anomalies
on
both
sides
of
the
coin
and
i
just
want
to
touch
on
both
very
briefly.
take
the
example
you
gave.
in
that
situation,
the
defendant's
fraud
or
concealment
the
would
allow
it
or
him
to
escape
paying
civil
penalties
but
not
private
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
this
court
has
never
privileged
a
private
lawsuit
above
a
government
enforcement
action
in
a
securities
context--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--but
even
in
that
context,
imagine
if
there's
a
private
right
of
action,
the
private
plaintiff
will
be
able
to
recover
damages
and
the
government
will
not--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--just
imagine
the
opposite,
which
is
far
more
dangerous.
imagine
a
bank
makes
a
bad
loan
to
a
veteran
or
a
bank
tells
the
fdic
that
it's
gotten
mortgage
insurance
to
help
lower
income
families
buy
homes
and
then
that
fraud
or
falsity
escapes
detection
for
five
years.
the
veterans
administration
or
the
fha
then
is
barred
from
bringing
a
civil
penalty
action,
and
there
is
no
private
right
of
action.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
but
the
reason
there's
no
private
right
of
action
in
those
contexts
is
in
part
because
government
agencies
can
seek
civil
penalties.
and
i
cannot
imagine
that
the
congress,
which
allowed
agencies
to
seek
civil
penalties,
where
here
they
had
existing
remedies,
would
have
thought
that
the
only
people
who
could
get
away
without
paying
them
are
the
ones
who
commit
fraud
or
concealment
and
that
remains
hidden
for
five
years.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right,
because
it
thought
that
the
agencies
could
seek
civil
penalties
and
that
was
sufficient.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no
question.
and
in
the
average
typical
case,
the
time
that
congress
afforded
is
enough
and
we're
not
here
claiming
any
different,
but
that--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
ginsburg,
there
was
a
lot
of
back
and
forth
between
the
parties,
document
exchanges,
they
wanted
to
make
additional
submissions.
the
government
hoped
that
there
would
be
a
settlement
that
would
encompass
all
the
defendants.
ultimately,
there
was
a
settlement
that
only
went
to
the
fund
and
petitioners
did
not
settle
and
then
the
government
put
together
and
brought
its
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
that's
fair.
we
didn't
go
--
it
wasn't
market
timing
that
we
discovered.
what
general
spitzer
announced
was
there
are
advisors
that
are
permitting
market
timing,
but
misleading
investors
about
it
and
they're
doing
it
in
return
for
investments
in
other
funds
that
they
manage,
what
are
called
sticky
asset
agreements,
and
then
we
started
doing
market
sweeps
for
those
agreements.
and
i
don't
think
we
can
ignore
the
evidence
here,
because
we
shouldn't
decide
the
case
based
on
feverish
hypotheticals.
there
are
25
reported
cases
brought
by
the
commission
involving
this
statute,
19
were
brought
within
5
years
and
they
were
just
reaching
back
to
pick
up
the
beginning
of
the
fraud.
and
the
other
six,
including
this
case,
the
longest
lag
time
was
six
and
a
half
years
from
the
end
of
the
fraud
to
bringing
the
complaint.
and
the
reason
is
these
are
dynamic
markets.
there's
a
lot
going
on
in
the
public
domain
that
puts
the
commission
on
notice,
inquiry
or
constructive,
and
starts
the
clock
running.
not
only
have
we
not
seen
a
10,
a
15,
a
20-year
case,
we
haven't
seen
a
7-year
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
right,
but
that--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--but
justice
breyer,
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer,
i
want
to
be
clear.
in
the
government's
view,
the
concealment
would
apply,
though
petitioners
or
others
like
them
will
be
back
here
making
exactly
the
same
arguments.
the
government's
point
is
just
that
equity
fraud
and
concealment
were
a
pair
and
the
justification
was
the
same
for
both.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
--
i--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
don't
think
the
petitioners
are
disputing
it
here,
but
i
think
mr.
liman
acknowledged
earlier
that
if
pressed,
his
arguments
could
be
leveraged
to
get
rid
of
the
concealment
doctrine,
too.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
oh,
no,
no,
not
--
i
didn't
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
i
wasn't
trying
to
mislead.
this
is
not
a
concealment
case.
this
is
a
fraud
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
this
is
a
fraud
case,
not
a
concealment
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
yes.
i
was
just
trying
to
say
that
once
you
say
there
is
a
concealment
exception,
the
fraud
exception
follows
from
equity
because
they
were
of
a
piece.
and
once
you
say
there
is
not
a
fraud
exception,
the
same
arguments
will
be
leveraged
to
get
rid
of
a
concealment
exception.
and
the
reason
that
equity
treated
them
as
--
of
a
piece
was
the
deception
was
the
same.
the
fraud
was
self-concealing
or
even
if
it
was
non-fraud,
the
defendant
could
conceal,
but
either
way--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
for
300
years,
english
and
american
courts
looking
at
this
problem
have
said
where
the
defendant's
misconduct,
be
it
fraud
or
be
it
concealment
of
a
non-fraud,
but
where
the
defendant's
deception
prevents
a
plaintiff
from
knowing
that
he,
she
or
it
has
a
cause
of
action,
equity
suspends
the
running
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
those
--
that
has
been--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
this
is
a
civil
action.
i
don't
think
even
petitioners
are
disputing
that.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
if
i
gave
up
anything
on
fraudulent
concealment--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
want
to
be
very
clear.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
all
the
same
arguments
are
going
to
apply.
petitioners--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--oh,
sure.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
breyer,
petitioners
in
a
future
case
would
be
back
here
saying:
the
text
of
the
statute
says
nothing
about
equitable
estoppel.
and
even
if
you've
applied
it
to
everybody
else's
actions,
you
can't
apply
it
to
me
because
i'm
somehow--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
--
i'll
be
as
right
then
as
i
am
now.
[laughter]
i
mean,
petitioners'
argument
has
this
sort
air
of
unreality.
you've
applied
it
everywhere
else
he
says,
but
not
to
me.
think
how
odd
that
is,
justice
scalia,
that
where
you
have
a
background
canon
that
says
ambiguities
get
construed
for
and
not
against
the
sovereign.
when
the
sovereign
sues
quasi-sovereign
to
enforce
the
laws,
that
is
somehow
a
subordinate
interest
and
the
sovereign
alone
cannot
take
advantage
of
the
fraud
discovery
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
there
are
--
that's
right.
there
are
very
few
cases
that
deal
with
this
statute
at
all,
and
obviously
in
this
context,
because
the
commission's
only
had
the
ability
to
bring
civil
penalties
for
about
20
years.
but
i
think
that
is
not
a
problem
unknown
to
the
law.
again
and
again,
facing
garden
variety
limitations
provisions
written
just
like
this
one,
this
court
applied
the
fraud
discovery
rule.
and
now
they
come
in
and
say:
oh,
but
you've
never
applied
it
to
this
statute.
that's
true,
but
everything
about
this
statute
is
identical
as
a
matter
of
text
and
history
to
the
statute
of
bailey.
the
cause
of
action
equally
accrued
there,
and
this
court's
applied
it
across
bankruptcies,
land,
patent
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--there
are
just
very
few
cases
on
it.
i
think
there
are
very
few
civil
penalty
actions
that
are
being
brought
at
all,
certainly
to
which
this
statute
apply,
and
certainly
that
deal
with
fraud
or
concealment
and
reach
outside
the
5-year
period.
and
i
don't
have
a
great
answer
for
why
there
aren't
cases.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
--
it
isn't
like
there
are
cases
rejecting
our
arguments.
we
just
see
an
absence
of
case
law.
but
what
we
do
see
is
cases
like
exploration
company,
where
the
government
comes
in,
is
really
suing
in
a
sovereign
capacity,
to
redistribute
land
from
some
private
land
owners
to
another
by
annulling
their
patents.
and
this
court
rejects
basically
exactly
the
same
arguments
petitioners
are
making
and
says
it
applies
equally
to
the
government
when
it
brings
an
action
as
to
private
plaintiffs.
now,
an
action
for
civil
penalties?
no,
the
relief
here
is
a
little
different,
but
if
one
looks
back
at
the
briefs
the
arguments
are
exactly
the
same.
they
made
exactly
the
same
claims
that
the
sky
was
falling
there,
and
for
100
years
they
have
not
been
true.
there
is
nothing
important
about
this
statute
as
a
matter
of
text,
structure
or
anything
else
from
the
other
statutes
to
which
this
court
has
again
and
again
applied
the
rule.
and
the
justification
is
the
same.
it's
the
defendant's
misconduct
which
keeps
the
plaintiff
from
knowing
of
her
cause
of
action.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no
question
in
the
typical
case,
but
what
equity
has
always
said
is
in
cases
of
fraud
or
concealment
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
repose
until
there
is
discovery
of
the
fraud.
and
equity
has
never
looked
at
the
identity
of
the
plaintiff,
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action,
the
plaintiff's
status,
role,
party
to
what
happened
in
the
case.
that
is
never--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
don't
think
that
there's
a
basis
for
separating
as
between
private
damages
lawsuits
and
civil
penalties.
i
think
when
congress
sets
a
statute
of
limitations,
that's
a
limitation
on
the
various
forms
of--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
two
very
important
things.
yes,
our
argument
would
absolutely
be
different
in
a
criminal
context.
in
cases
like
marion
and
toussie,
this
court
has
explained
how
statutes
of
limitations
function
in
the
criminal
context
is
very
different.
they
are
presumptively
not
equitably
tolled,
whereas
civil
statutes
are
presumptively
equitably
tolled.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
in
hudson
v.
united
states--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
the
court
walked
through
in
hudson
v.
united
states
the
test
for
denominating
a
civil
from
a
criminal
penalty.
the
main
thing
is
what
congress
denominates
it,
although
you
can
look
behind
that.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
here,
there
is
no
question
that
this
is
a
civil
penalty.
it
was
denominated
by
congress
that
way,
it
functions
that
way,
it
is
phrased
that
way.
i
think
even
petitioners
and
all
of
their
amici
--
not
a
single
person
on
that
side
of
the
case
has
attempted
to
argue
this
penalty
is
criminal
rather
than
civil
under
hudson.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
the
court
has
always
said
that
whether
the
penalty
is
civil
or
criminal
carries
with
it
a
different
set
of
legal
rules
or
norms,
and
no
party
has
ever
successfully
come
into
court
and
said,
well,
it
may
be
civil,
but
it's
a
little
criminal-like,
so
i
should
borrow
from
the
criminal
context.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
hudson
overruled
halper
in
large
part,
and
no
one
here
has
asked
this
court
to
label
this
a
criminal
penalty.
they
have
asked
the
court
to
call
this
a
civil
penalty
and
yet
say
the
fraud
discovery
rule
does
not
apply.
that,
there
is
no
precedent
for.
