justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
apply
to
social
security?
does
it
apply
to
veterans
affairs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
this
statute
apply
to
social
security?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
apply
to
veterans
affairs?
yes
or
no
or
you
don't
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
social
security?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
asking
about
this
statute.
does
it
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
defense
department?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
antitrust?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ftc,
you
don't
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
apply
to
ftc,
okay.
so
social
security,
ftc.
veterans
affairs
we
don't
know,
antitrust
we
don't
know.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
medicare,
medicaid?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
the
question,
because
i
certainly
agree
with
justice
scalia
that
this
is
not
an
sec
statute,
this
is
not
a
securities
statute;
it
is
a
statute
that
applies
to
all
government
actions,
which
is
a
huge
category
across
the
board
and
it's
about
200
years
old.
and
until
2004
i
haven't
found
a
single
case
in
which
the
government
ever
tried
to
assert
the
discovery
rule
where
what
they
were
seeking
was
a
civil
penalty,
not
to
try
to
make
themselves
whole
where
they
are
a
victim,
with
one
exception,
a
case
called
maillard
in
the
19th
century
where
they
did
make
that
assertion.
they
were
struck
down
by
the
district
court,
and
the
attorney
general
in
his
opinion
said:
the
district
court's
absolutely
right;
of
course,
the
government
cannot
effectively
abolish
the
statute
of
limitations
where
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
to
gather
something
that's
so
close
to
a
criminal
case.
okay.
so
my
question
is:
is
there
any
case
at
all
until
the
year
2004,
approximately,
in
which
the
government
has
either
tried
or
certainly
succeeded
in
taking
this
general
statute
and
applying
the
discovery
rule
where
they
are
not
a
victim,
they
are
trying
to
enforce
the
law
for
the
civil
penalty?
the
reason
i
brought
up
social
security,
veteran's
affairs,
medicare,
is
it
seems
to
me
to
have
enormous
consequences
for
the
government
suddenly
to
try
to
assert
a
quasi-criminal
penalty
and
abolish
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
mean,
in
a
vast
set
of
cases.
and
that
--
you
know,
i
have
overstated
that
last
remark
a
little
bit,
but
i
want
you
to
see
where
i'm
coming
from,
which
isn't
so
different
from
the
--
from
the
questions
that
have
been
put
to
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
i'm
asking
you
for
is
one
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
is
not
a
problem
of
fairly
recent
vintage.
i'd
say
for
200
years
there
is
no
case.
the
only
case,
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover,
which
is
why
i
am
asking,
is
that
what
created
the
problem
of
recent
vintage
is
that
the
seventh
circuit,
i
guess,
or
a
couple
of
other
circuits
decided
that
this
discovery
rule
did
apply
to
an
effort
by
the
government
to
assert
a
civil
penalty.
that's
what
created
the
problem.
before
that
there
was
no
problem;
it
was
clear
the
government
couldn't
do
it.
all
right.
now,
you
will
tell
me
that
i'm
wrong
by
citing
some
cases
that
show
i'm
wrong.
and
that's
what
i'm
asking.
i
want
to
be
told
i'm
wrong,
sort
of.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
haven't
found
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
we
are
asking
the
same
question,
but
in
30
seconds
i
am
going
to
conclude
there
is
none.
what
i
want
is
a
case
before
the
year
2000
in
which
the
government
sought
a
civil
penalty
and
was
not
trying
to
recover
money
or
land
that
it
had
lost,
and
i
want
the
name
of
that
case
in
which
they
said
that
the
discovery
rule
applies.
the
two
that
you
cited,
amy
and
the
case
of
broderick's
will,
did
involve
the
government
being
injured
by
losing
land
or
losing
money,
something
like
that.
so
i
have
those
and
i
don't
think
they
count,
but
i
will
look
at
them
again.
is
there
anything
else
you
would
like
to
refer
me
to?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
would
be
that
the
--
you
know,
once
you
start
talking
about
applying
this
to
social
security,
for
example,
or
to
medicare,
for
example,
or
to
dod,
for
example,
you
have
somebody
who
did
commit
some
fraud
and
they
kept
the
money.
you
know,
she
had
five
children
not
four,
or
she
has
five,
not
six.
and
i
can
understand
it
being
fair
when
the
government
catches
her,
you
know,
18
years
later,
they
say,
we
want
our
money
back.
okay.
i
say
that's
fair,
not
necessarily
merciful
but
fair.
but
then
to
go
and
say,
and
in
addition
we
want
this
civil
penalty,
even
though
--
of
course,
we
couldn't
have
discovered
it.
don't
you
know
there
are
4
million
people
who
get
social
security
or
40
million
or
something,
and
we
can't
police
every
one.
so
suddenly,
i
see
i
am
opening
the
door,
not
just
to
getting
your
money
back
but
to
also
you're
having
what
looked
like
criminal
penalties
years
later
without
much
benefit
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
that
is
at
the
back
of
my
mind.
and
i'd
like
to
know,
having
brought
it
up
front,
what
your
response
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
not
the
securities
context.
this
is
the
context
of
--
that's
why
i
started
down
the
road
i
was
down.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
because
you
have
two
people
who
are
hurt,
where
two
people
have
been
hurt.
for
example,
i
wrote
the
case
in
burk
and
we
had
the
statute
of
limitations
and
congress
focused
on
this.
and
it
wrote
a
two-tier
statute.
and
it
wrote
a
two-tier
statute
in
large
part
because
it
was
concerned
about
the
problem
you
mention.
you
have
a
victim.
so
you're
either
going
to
let
the
defendant
keep
the
money
or
the
victim
gets
it
back.
i
understand
that.
but
this
is
not
that
context.
this
is
like
a
criminal
context
where
not
only
are
you
getting
your
money
back,
but
you
also
want
to
assess
a
kind
of
criminal
penalty,
and
in
that
situation,
i
see
a
pretty
clear
line
and
i
don't
understand
why
the
government
is
so
anxious
to
change
what
has
long
been
the
apparent--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
correct,
you
have
a
fraud
and
you
can't
put
them
in
jail
either,
but
you
can
get
your
money
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
you
can't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
if
all
that's
true,
and
this
is
a
point
i
want
you
to
--
i'm
not
sure
i
am
right
about
this
point,
but
remember
your
banking
case
now,
we're
sounding
like
that,
i
thought
--
doesn't
the
doctrine
of
fraudulent
concealment
still
apply?
that
is,
if
the
defendant,
in
fact,
takes
any
affirmative
action
to
hide
what's
going
on,
the
statute
will
be
tolled.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
as
long
as
that's
right,
then
in
all
your
banking
cases,
there
are
bank
inspectors
all
over
these
banks,
i
hope,
you
know,
about
once
a
month
or
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
once
a
year.
and
so
the
chance
of
there
--
the
chance
of
this
somehow
escaping
notice
without
fraudulent
concealment,
which
would
allow
the
government
to
extend
the
toll
strikes
me
as
small,
but
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
it
was
the
opposite.
in
other
words,
i
thought
both
parties,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
are
assuming
fraudulent
concealment
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
we
are
not
to
consider
fraudulent
concealment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
when
i
say
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
assume
that
we
are
on
the
same
ground,
but
i
don't
know
that
you
have
--
i
mean,
i'm
worried
about
your
giving
up
the
fraudulent
concealment.
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
give
up
equitable
estoppel,
would
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
i
mean
--
i
mean,
there's
nothing--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
were
to
say
--
if
we
--
if
the
court
were
to
hold,
it
seemed
to
me,
and
this
is
again
tentative
to
get
your
response,
but
if
the
--
if
the
court
were
to
hold
the
discovery
doesn't
--
rule
doesn't
apply,
there's
nothing
in
that
that
says
equitable
--
equitable
tolling
doesn't
apply,
nothing
in
that
that
says
equitable
estoppel
doesn't
apply,
nothing
in
that
that
says
fraudulent
concealment
doesn't
apply.
now,
you've
shaken
me
a
little
bit
on
the
fraudulent
concealment,
but
i
don't
know
about
the
other
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
not
the
equitable
estoppel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
equitable
estoppel,
the
person
comes
in
and
says:
oh,
yes,
i'll
tell
you
all
about
what
i
did,
but
by
the
way,
i
won't
assert
a
statute
of
limitations
defense,
i
promise.
and
the
court
says:
hey,
you
just
asserted
one,
you
can't.
