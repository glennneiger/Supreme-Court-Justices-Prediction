mr.
liman,
what
you
suggested,
when
we
talked
about
the
discovery
rule,
is
that
it
has
a
basis
in
the
notion
that
a
defendant
with
unclean
hands
who
has
committed
deceptive
conduct
preventing
the
plaintiff
from
understanding
that
he
or
it
has
a
cause
of
action,
you
know,
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
a
statute
of
limitations.
and
if
that's
the
understanding
that
lies
behind
the
discovery
rule,
i
guess
the
question
for
you
is,
why
doesn't
it
apply
in
this
case
as
well
as
in
the
case
where
the
person
bringing
the
action
has
himself
suffered
a
harm?
justice
elena
kagan
it
is
true,
though,
isn't
it,
that
justice
scalia
pointed
to
an
anomaly
that
could
easily
exist
in
other
contexts,
because
this
isn't
only
a
statute
about
securities
violations.
so
that
you
might
have
in
other
contexts
in
which
this
statute
applies
a
world
in
which
a
private
individual
could
sue,
but
the
government
--
could
sue
after
the
--
the
period
of
time--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
5
years,
but
the
government
could
not.
justice
elena
kagan
and
i
take
it
that
your
view
would
be
that
a
case
like
exploration,
it's
different
than
this
case
because
it
does
have
a
natural
start
date;
is
that
the
idea?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
wall,
i'll
go
even
further
than
justice
ginsburg.
and
this
case
actually
seems
to
me
a
good
example
when
mr.
liman
said
there's
no
natural
starting
point
and
justice
kennedy
and
justice
alito
referred
to
just
--
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
decision
about
enforcement
priorities.
the
government
had
decided
not
to
go
after
market
timers.
and
it
changed
its
decision
when
a
state
attorney
general
decided
to
do
it,
and
it
embarrassed
them
that
they
had
made
that
enforcement
priority
decision,
and
then
the
government
made
a
different
enforcement
priority
decision.
but
that's
not
the
kind
of
situation
that
the
discovery
rule
was
intended
to
operate
on,
is
it?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
wall,
why
is
it
that
you
don't
you
have
any
cases?
i
mean,
you
said
way
back
when:
this
didn't
come
up,
this
is
a
modern
problem.
so
explain
to
me
why
this
is
a
modern
problem.
this
is
obviously
an
old
statute.
are
you
saying
that
this
statute
has
not
been
used
very
--
was
not
used
very
much
until
very,
very
recently?
justice
elena
kagan
but
what
you're
running
up
against
is
a
skepticism,
that,
you
know,
the
government,
which
has
not
asserted
this
power
for
200
years,
is
now
coming
in
and
saying
we
want
this.
and
the
question
is
why
hasn't
the
government
asserted
this
power
previously?
