chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-1274,
gabelli
and
alpert
v.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
liman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
ignores
the
point
that
has
been
raised,
is
that
this
statute
does
not
just
apply
in
the
sec
context.
how
many
cases
have
you
found
across
the
board
in
the
range
of
those
areas
that
justice
breyer
catalogued?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
depends
really
on
how
many
enforcement
officers
the
sec
has,
is
it
reasonable
for
them
to
have
been
aware
of
the
particular
item
in
some
publication.
maybe
if
they've
got
1,000
people
reviewing
it,
but
maybe
not
if
they
have
10;
and
that's
just
not
the
--
i
mean,
it's
not
just
the
sec;
it's
all
these
other
government
areas.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
going
to
be
almost
impossible
for
somebody
to
prove
that
the
government
should
have
known
about
something.
and
which
part
of
the
government?
i
mean,
it's
a
big,
big
government,
and
particular
agencies
--
well,
you
say,
well,
the
defense
contractor
board
should
have
known,
but
does
that
mean
that
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
or
the
defense
counsel's
office
should
have
known?
it
seems
to
me
that,
at
least
with
respect
to
that
aspect,
you
really
are
eliminating
any
real
--
it's
certainly
not
a
lot
of
repose
if
the
idea
is,
well,
i've
got
to
establish
that
this
particular
government
agency
should
have
known
about
this.
you
certainly
can't
sit
back
and
say,
well,
5
years
has
gone
by
and--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--they
can't
point
to
a
single
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
it's
significant
if
you
can't
point
to
a
single
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
reason
--
the
reason
there's
no
private
action
--
right
of
action
is
not
because
the
government
could
seek
civil
penalties,
it's
because
congress
hasn't
provided
a
private
right
of
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
necessarily
think,
and
that's
why
we
have
a
case,
that
they
could
seek
civil
penalties
10
years
later,
18
years
later,
however
long,
so
long
as
they
were
busy
doing
other
things
and
didn't
have
a
chance
to
know.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
made
the
point
earlier
that
it
would
be
very
odd
that
it's
only
the
sovereign
that
doesn't
benefit
from
the
discovery
rule
when
other
people
can.
but
it's
when
it's
the
sovereign
that's
bringing
the
action
that
the
concerns
about
repose
are
particularly
presented.
you
know,
the
sovereign,
with
all
of
its
resources,
can
decide
to
go
after
whomever
it
discovers,
however
many
years
after
--
whether
it's
the
social
security
recipient
that
justice
breyer
mentioned
or
anyone
else.
so
i
at
least
don't
find
it
unusual
that
it's
the
sovereign
in
particular
that
doesn't
get
the
benefit
of
whenever
you
happen
to
find
about
it
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
agree
that
when
we're
talking
about
the
interests
in
repose
that
the
one
plaintiff
that
we
should
be
particularly
concerned
about
is
the
government?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
halper
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
liman,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
what
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1274,
gabelli
versus
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
the
investment
advisers
act
makes
it
illegal
for
investment
advisers
to
defraud
their
clients,
and
authorizes
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
seek
civil
penalties
from
investment
advisers
who
do
so.
when
the
government
brings
such
a
civil
penalty
case,
there
is
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations.
it
provides
that
“an
action
for
the
enforcement
of
any
civil
penalty
shall
not
be
entertained
unless
commenced
within
five
years
from
the
date
when
the
claim
first
accrued.”
the
question
here
is
when
a
fraud
claim
accrues.
in
other
words,
when
the
five-year
clock
of
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
tick,
is
it
when
the
fraud
occurs
or
when
the
fraud
is
discovered?
in
this
case,
the
relevant
fraud
occurred
between
1999
and
2002.
it
was
discovered
in
2003
and
the
sec
sued
the
petitioners
in
2008.
if
the
clock
begins
to
tick
when
the
fraud
occurred,
the
sec
waited
too
long
and
it
cannot
recover
civil
penalties.
if
the
clock
begins
to
tick
when
the
fraud
was
discovered,
the
claim
can
go
forward.
now,
as
noted,
the
statute
says,
“the
limitation
period
begins
to
run
when
the
claim
first
accrued.”
we
think
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
is
when
the
fraud
occurs.
our
cases
have
long
said
that
a
claim
generally
accrues
when
the
events
giving
rise
to
it
take
place.
such
a
reading
advances,
the
policies
behind
statutes
of
limitations,
those
statutes
are
meant
to
provide
repose.
as
years
go
by,
memories
fade,
witnesses
disappear
and
evidence
is
lost.
it
is
a
basic
feature
of
our
legal
system
that
at
some
point,
bygones
must
be
bygones.
the
rule
that
a
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
when
the
alleged
events
take
place,
provides
relative
certainty
about
when
we
have
reached
the
point
of
repose.
now,
at
the
same
time,
our
cases
have
explained
that
a
different
approach
is
necessary
in
cases
of
fraud
where
a
defendant's
deceptive
conduct
prevents
a
plaintiff
from
even
knowing
that
he
has
been
defrauded.
there,
we
have
applied
the
discovery
rule.
that
will
preserve
the
claims
of
victims
who
do
not
know
they
have
been
injured
and
who
reasonably
do
not
ask
about
any
injury.
now,
that
makes
sense.
usually,
when
a
person
is
injured,
he
knows
it
and
is
put
on
notice,
that
his
time
to
sue
is
running.
but
when
an
injury
is
self-concealing,
as
in
the
case
of
fraud,
a
person
might
not
know
of
it,
and
most
of
us
do
not
live
in
a
state
of
constant
investigation.
we
do
not
typically
spend
our
days
looking
for
evidence
that
we
were
lied
to
or
defrauded.
fortunately,
the
law
does
not
require
us
to
do
so.
instead,
until
we
discover
or
reasonably
should
have
discovered
a
fraud,
the
statute
of
limitations
on
our
claims
does
not
begin
to
run.
but
that
logic
does
not
work
for
the
government.
the
sec,
for
example,
is
not
like
the
individual
victim
who
relies
on
apparent
injury
to
learn
of
a
wrong.
rather
the
sec's
very
mission
is
to
investigate
violations
of
the
security's
laws.
its
purpose
is
to
root
out
fraud,
and
the
sec
has
many
legal
weapons
on
hand
to
do
so.
the
government
also
seeks
a
different
kind
of
relief
in
these
cases.
the
discovery
rule
helps
to
ensure
that
the
injured
are
compensated,
but
this
case
involves
penalties
which
go
beyond
compensation
are
intended
to
punish
and
label
defendants
as
wrong
doers.
chief
justice
marshall
said
over
200
years
ago
that
it
“would
be
utterly
repugnant
to
the
genius
of
our
laws
if
actions
for
penalties
could
be
brought
at
any
distance
of
time.”
now,
with
language
like
that,
you
get
the
sense
that
he
meant
it.
applying
the
discovery
rule
here
would
raise
similar
concerns.
defendants
would
be
exposed
to
government
enforcement
actions
not
only
for
five
years
after
their
misdeeds,
but
for
an
uncertain
period
into
the
future.
in
determining
when
the
government
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
of
a
fraud
would
present
particular
challenges
for
the
courts.
agencies
often
have
hundreds
of
employees,
dozens
of
offices,
and
several
levels
of
leadership.
in
such
a
case,
when
does
the
government
know
of
a
violation?
who
is
the
relevant
actor?
agencies
also
have
resource
constraints
and
enforcement
priorities.
do
we
consider
those
in
determining
when
the
government
should
have
known
of
a
violation,
and
if
so,
how?
these
questions
make
applying
a
discovery
rule
to
government
penalty
actions,
far
more
challenging
than
applying
it
to
suits
by
defrauded
victims.
now,
perhaps
the
most
important
consideration
is
history.
when
you
look
back
over
the
past
two
centuries,
you
see
we
have
applied
the
discovery
rule
to
preserve
the
fraud
claims
of
private
injured
parties
many
times,
but
we
have
never
applied
it
in
a
penalty
case
such
as
this
in
favor
of
the
government
and
we
are
not
going
to
start
today.
the
decision
below
to
the
contrary
is
reversed.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
