justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
just
asked?
what
if
a
claim
could
have
reasonably
been
discovered
by
a
government
agency
if
it
had
more
resources,
but
given
the
resources
that
it
had
it
couldn't
have
reasonably
discovered
the
claim?
would
the
discovery
rule
apply
there?
