chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-126,
mcquiggin
v.
perkins.
mr.
bursch?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
i
think
argues
that
that
--
they
put
that
in
expressly
because
they
limited
what
would
be
the
otherwise
applicable
miscarriage
of
justice
provision
in
the
question
that's
before
us
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
your
--
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
readler?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
say
on
page
17
of
your
brief
that
this
court
has
applied
the
manifest-injustice
exception
to
limits
created
by
congress.
what's
your
best
case
for
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
mean,
acts
of
congress?
your
sentence
says,
applied
at
the
limits
created
by
congress.
i
read
that
to
mean
statutes
of
limitations,
but
that's
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
2255,
remind
me?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
said
what
with
respect
to
time--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--said
what
with
respect
to
the
time
limits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
you
said
limits,
you
didn't
mean
time
limits;
you
meant
substantive
limits?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
procedural
limits.
do
you
have
a
case
that
applies
it
to
time
limits,
which
of
course
is
the
question
we
have
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
you
said
limits
created
by
congress.
so
just
--
i
mean,
i
should
read
“
limits
created
by
congress
”
not
to
mean
time
limits,
but
procedural
or
other
limits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
i
guess
that's
the
point
of
my
questioning
and
your
friend's
position.
there
have
never
been
any
time
limits
created
by
congress
that
have
been
abrogated
by
a
manifest-injustice
exception.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
the
difference
is
in
holland
we
are
dealing
with
equitable
tolling,
which
had
applied
as
far
back
as,
you
know,
whatever
the
law
goes
to
limitations;
in
other
words,
equitable
tolling
which
is
different
from
the
abrogation
i
think
that
you
are
asking
for.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
they
don't
want
to
definitely
file
within
one
year
if
they
don't
have
anything
to
say.
you
know,
if
it
takes
a
certain
amount
of
time
before
they
either
acquire
it
legitimately
or
can
find
somebody
or,
i
don't
know,
in
this
case,
the
codefendant
dies,
everybody
has
no
reason
any
more
to
object
and
pin
it
on
him.
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
that
it's
in
some
of
these
prisoners'
interest
to
drag
things
out
and
then
to
file.
they
don't
have
anything
to
say
within
the
one
year
and
need
time
to
either,
from
your
point
of
view,
legitimately
develop
the
evidence,
or,
from
your
friend's
point
of
view,
to
concoct
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
responds
to
that
point,
i
think,
by
saying
that
every
state
allows
collateral
review
in
that
instance
and
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
simply
preclusion
of
the
second
bite
at
the
apple
or
a
third
bite
at
the
apple,
i
guess,
by
--
by
assumption
in
the
federal
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
the
actual-innocence
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
the
most
--
is
that
the
most
--
i
thought
i
understood
your
friend
to
say,
he
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
every
state
has
an
avenue
for
considering
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
how
long
did
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
this
established
after
--
after
some
kind
of
evidentiary
hearing,
the
delay,
whether
he
delayed
for
a
particular
purpose
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
--
why
did
your
client
wait
5
years
after
the
last
affidavit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean,
the
whole
question
--
and
your
friend
made
the
point
--
the
question
is
how
many
are
filed,
in
how
many
cases
does
the
claim
arise,
not
how
few
times
it's
upheld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
know
which
of
these
are
meritorious
and
which
aren't?
is
this
the
meritorious
--
i
assume
you
think
this
is
a
meritorious
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
your
friend
says
nobody
can
reasonably
think
this
person
is
innocent.
maybe
he
has
constitutional
claims.
but
if
you
look
at
the
evidence,
is
this
something
that
at
a
preliminary
stage,
you
look
and
say
oh,
this
guy's
clearly
innocent
and
this
goes
forward,
or
is
it
one
that
you
can
cast
aside?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bursch,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
go
ahead,
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning,
case
12-126,
mcquiggin
versus
perkins.
