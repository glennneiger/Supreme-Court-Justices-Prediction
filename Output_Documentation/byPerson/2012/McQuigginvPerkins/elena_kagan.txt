justice
elena
kagan
but
you're
creating
a
world
in
which
this
would
function
as
an
exception
to
a
state
time
limit,
but
not
to
the
aedpa
time
limit.
justice
elena
kagan
why
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
elena
kagan
but
i
thought
we
said
in
missouri
v.
holland
that
aedpa
was
--
was
enacted
against
a
background
rule
which
stated
that
normal
equitable
principles,
such
as
this
one,
which
had
been
applied
everywhere
to
all
procedural
bars,
that
aedpa
suggested
that
those
would
--
wouldn't
fit
--
aedpa
was
against
a
background
that
those
would
continue
to
apply.
justice
elena
kagan
and
why
is
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
any
different?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
again,
it's
congress
that
we
said
in
holland,
that
it's
congress
and
aedpa
has
--
has
--
was
drafted
against
this
presumption
that
normal
equitable
principles
would
apply.
justice
elena
kagan
but
again,
why
would
congress
have
thought
that
there
would
be
any
difference
in
--
with
respect
to
a
statute
of
limitations?
justice
elena
kagan
but
that
applies
to
states
as
well.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bursch,
you
suggested
earlier
some
way
out
of
this
puzzle
about
why
congress
would
have
put
the
actual-innocence
exception
into
the
second
successive
petition
provision,
and
not
had
one
for
a
first
petition--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
that
seems
really
quite
odd
to
me.
i
mean,
a
number
of
my
colleagues
have
said
can
we
really
believe
that
congress
contemplated
this.
but,
i
mean,
don't
we
have
evidence
that
congress
contemplated
it,
in
the
second
and
successive
context,
a
slightly
tighter
version,
wouldn't
it
be
quite
odd
to
say
that
congress
contemplated
an
actual-innocence
exception
when
you
are
on
your
second
petition
but
barred
it
when
you
are
on
your
first?
what
sense
would
that
be.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
i'm
just
not
sure
i
understand
that.
i
mean,
they
could
have
added
a
separate
provision.
just
saying,
there's
an
actual-innocence
exception
or
there
is
--
there's
not
consistent
with
the
way
they
did
it
in
the
second
and
successive
petition.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
didn't
have
to.
why
would
it
have
necessarily
limited
(d)(1)(d)?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
just
you
make
the
converse
clear.
justice
elena
kagan
all
i'm
saying
is
that
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
creates
a
glaring
anomaly
that
people
would
be
out
of
court
on
the
first
petition
and
they
could
turn
around
on
their
second
petition,
which
is
usually
disfavored,
and
get
an
actual-innocence
exception.
