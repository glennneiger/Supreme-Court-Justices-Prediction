that
--
that's
not
quite
what
he's
saying.
we've
had
a
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
for
as
long
as
there's
been
a
habeas
statute.
we've
applied
it
repeatedly.
it's
not
that
it
trumps
it,
but
that
it
puts
into
doubt
the
evidence
you're
claiming.
proves
your
actual
innocence.
it's
not
the
sort
of
situation
where
as
reasonable
--
as
due
diligence
will
do,
which
is
to
override
even
an
actually
innocent
person.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
he
says
is
it
--
it
really
puts
into
question
the
validity
of
your
claim.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
does
that
leave
us?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it's
sort
of
an
advisory
opinion
in
your
judgment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
sure,
it
would
be,
because
you're
telling
us
that
there
is
no
proof
of
actual
innocence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
we
just
say
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
might
be
its
holding,
but,
as
justice
alito
just
proved,
there's
no
basis
for
it
because
they
didn't
grant
a
coa
on
the
substantive
merits
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
with
respect
to
successive
petitions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
see
a
difference--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand.
i
mean,
there
is
a
presumption
that's
been
longstanding
that
at
least
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
your
first
petition,
that
it
is
a
statute
of
limitations
subject
to
exceptions,
including
the
manifest
injustice
one.
if
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
they
intended
not
to
have
that
apply,
they
would
have
done
what
they
did
with
the
successive
petition,
but
they
chose
not
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
talking
about
that
presumption.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
talking
about--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--our
cause
and
effect
and
manifest
injustice.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
actual-innocence
claims
win
on
the
underlying
constitutional
issue?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
wins
on
the
attempt?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
many.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
--
why
is
it
that
the
meritorious
claim
is
going
to
be
the
one
that's
going
to
be
hidden?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
you
would
--
you
want
to
keep
it
out
altogether.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
want
an
actually
--
potentially
actually
innocent
person
not
to
have--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
they
don't
have
the
federal
system--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
the
first
habeas.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
see--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
there
has
always
been
a
laches
defense
until
rule
9(a)
was
rescinded.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
there's
been
some
form,
not
a
due
diligence,
but
some
form
of
check
on
a
prisoner
waiting
so
long
that
a
state
can't
respond.
the
--
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
so
he's
asking
you,
i
think,
to
tell
us
how
to
write
it.
so
do
we
write
it
by
saying
there's
no
diligence
requirement,
but
there
is
a
sort
of
common
law
laches,
although
that's
a
hard
argument
to
make
because
it
was
based
on
9(a)
until
recently.
or,
do
we
just
say
it's
equity
and
equity
would
suggest
that
if
it's
contrived,
the
delay
is
contrived,
that
the
evidence
is
suspect
and
doesn't
--
shouldn't
be
credited?
