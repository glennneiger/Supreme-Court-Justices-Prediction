it's
--
it's
a
small
point
and
doesn't
go
to
the
general
issues
you
have
to
discuss
with
us,
but
just
on
the
small
point,
he
gets
--
i
forget
exactly
the
detail
--
he
gets
an
affidavit
that
jones
did
it
within
a
year.
he
has
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
if
i
were
the
prisoner,
i'd
say,
you
know,
this
one
might
not
work.
maybe
i
can
get
two.
and
then
he
gets
a
second,
which
makes
a
certain
amount
of
sense
to
me,
although
a
substantial
period
of
time
elapses.
and
the
same
thing
happens
with
the
third.
it
makes
sense
to
me
that
the
prisoner
might
try
to
wait
for
the
third.
how
--
how
does
that
factor
into
your
diligence,
assuming
we
get
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
quite
--
excuse
me
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
wouldn't
mean
that
you
have
a
whole
raft
of
--
of
petition-protective
decisions
waiting
on
the
shelf
in
the
district
court.
that
--
that
--
that
causes
its
own
congestion
problems
in
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.

your
--
your
--
your
three-way
classification,
you
began
with
herrera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
in
a
way,
you're
saying
that
you're
three
loops
back
in
the
herrera
a
bit,
because
here
the
innocence
is
the
factual
predicate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
--
are
you
saying
that
this
case
is
a
fortiori
from
a
successive
petition,
because
this
isn't
a
successive
petition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying
that
congress
knows
how
to
write--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--an
exception
if
they
want
it.
but
this
(b)
does
apply
to
successive
petitions
and
this
is
really
before
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
bribed
jurors
not
a
miscarriage
of
justice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
juror
who's
bribed,
is
there
no
--
no
miscarriage
of
justice
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
we're
talking
about
the
meaning
of
the
term
“
miscarriage
of
justice
”.
it
seems
to
me
there
--
there
are
many
serious
errors
that
can
be
described
by
that
general
phrase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
to
say
it's
a
term
of
art?
fine.
