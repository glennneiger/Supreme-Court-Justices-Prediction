justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
have
some
difficulty
understanding
what
the
sixth
circuit
was
doing.
and
maybe
you
can
help
me
with
that.
the
district
court
as
i
understand
it
said
to
the
petitioner:
you
lose
for
two
reasons.
first,
you
don't
really
have
evidence
of
actual
innocence,
not
enough
anyway;
and
second
--
and
i
can
understand
that,
because
the
evidence
--
well,
the
most
that
is
suggested
by
the
affidavits
is
that
jones
was
a
participant
in
this
murder,
not
that
perkins
was
not
responsible
for
the
murder.
but
anyway,
so
you
lose
for
two
reasons.
first,
you
don't
really
have
evidence
of
actual
innocence;
second,
you
weren't
diligent.
the
sixth
circuit
grants
a
certificate
of
appealability
only
on
the
issue
of
diligence
and
they
say
diligence
doesn't
make
any
difference.
well,
where
does
that
leave
the
petitioner?
he's
already
lost
on
the
question
of
whether
there's
evidence
of
actual
innocence
and
there
was
no
appeal
on
that
issue.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
what
they're
contemplating,
but
they
can't
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
district
court
adequately
addressed
the
issue
of
adequate
innocence
--
of
actual
innocence
unless
that
issue
is
before
them.
and
the
issue
isn't
supposed
to
be
before
them
unless
--
isn't
before
them
unless
the
certificate
of
appealability
was
issued,
and
there
was
no
certificate
of
appealability
on
that
issue.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
the
district
court
--
or
you
seem
to
suggest
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
saying
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
for
an
actual-innocence
claim.
maybe
that's
the
case,
maybe
it
was
wrong.
but
if
it
decided
that
issue
and
the
issue
wasn't
appealed,
then
the
issue
is
settled.
and
that's
the
problem
that
i
see.
now,
how
do
you
get
around
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
you
ask
for
a
certificate
--
what
other
issues
did
you
ask
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
on?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
other
issues
did
he
ask
for
a
certificate
on?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
are
asking
for
what
is
potentially
a
very
big
exception
to
the
1-year
statute
of
limitations.
if
you
took
a
poll
of
all
of
the
prisoners
in
michigan,
how
many
of
them
do
you
think
would
say
they
are
actually
innocent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
very
few
would
say
they
are
actually
innocent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
oh,
credibly
say.
but
how
many
would
say
that
they
are
actually
innocent?
a
lot.
and
a
lot
would
be
able
to
come
up
with
evidence
that
is
equal
to
what
the
petition
--
what
the
respondent
here
has
come
up
with.
now,
do
you
think
it's
plausible
that
congress,
in
establishing
this
new
1-year
statute
of
limitations
because
it
doesn't
want
these
things
to
drag
on
indefinitely,
intended
to
create
an
exemption
that
broad
so
that
anybody
who
claims
to
be
actually
innocent
can
at
least
get
over
--
can
get
to
the
point
where
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
the
--
has
to
weigh
this
evidence
of
actual
innocence
to
see
whether
it
gets
over
the
threshold?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
plausible
given
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
aedpa?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
very
odd,
because
if
you
have
somebody
who's
actually
innocent,
then
you're
saying
that
person
can't
get
out
of
prison
unless
the
person
happens
to
have
a
good
constitutional
claim
that's
totally
unrelated
to
the
fact
that
the
person
is
actually
innocent.
that's
very
odd,
isn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
is
this
exception.
why
shouldn't
diligence
be
required?
how
can
it
be
equitable
to
allow
someone
to
bring
a
claim
when
the
person
has
--
involving
new
evidence,
when
the
person
has
not
been
diligent
in
presenting
this
new
evidence
to
the
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
as
your
--
as
your
adversary
says,
there's
nothing
really
procedurally
complicated
about
filing
a
federal
habeas.
there
--
there
are
forms
--
i've
read
hundreds
of
them
that
have
been
filed
by
pro
se
petitioners,
and
there
is
nothing
technical
about
claiming:
“
i'm
innocent
of
this
offense
”.
this
isn't
a
legal
issue.
it's
something
anybody
can
understand.
i've
got
an
--
i've
got
my
sister's
affidavit,
i
have
an
affidavit
by
a
third
person,
i
have
an
affidavit
by
a
person
who
worked
in
the
dry
cleaning
shop
that
shows
that
i'm
actually
innocent.
why
doesn't
--
what
is
the
reason
for
waiting
5
years
to
file
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i
--
i
don't
understand
your
answer
about
why
it
took
him
5
years
from
the
--
from
obtaining
the
last
affidavit
to
the
filing
of
the
federal
habeas.
you
said
he
couldn't
get
a
lawyer.
he
really
didn't
need
a
lawyer
to
do
this.
he
didn't
have
access
to
a
library.
this
isn't
a
legal
issue,
this
isn't
a
complicated
legal
issue.
it's
a
factual
issue
that
anybody
who
watches
detective
shows
on
tv
can
understand.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
think
that
congress,
which
in
aedpa
was
trying
to
speed
all
this
up
and
get
rid
of
the
delay
and
make
things
simpler,
intended
to
allow
that?
you
could
wait
5
years,
you
could
wait
10
years,
you
could
wait
15
years;
it
doesn't
matter?
that's
what
aedpa
was
intended
to
do?
