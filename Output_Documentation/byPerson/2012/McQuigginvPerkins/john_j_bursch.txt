mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we're
not
dealing
here
with
the
situation
where
a
prisoner
is
trying
to
gather
new
evidence
as
to
have
a
tolling
rule.
that
takes
care
of
that
problem.
we're
also
not
dealing
with
anything
that
prevented
petitioner
from
filing,
because
that's
the
problem
you
sought
in
holland.
what
we
have
here
is
the
question
of
when
a
petitioner
must
file
his
federal
habeas
petition
when
he
has
the
evidence
and
there
are
no
barriers
to
filing.
and
2244(d)(1)(d)
addresses
that
exact
question.
it
says,
“
within
1
year
”.
now,
mr.
perkins
asks
for
a
fairly
dramatic
expansion
of
holland.
what
he
wants
is
equitable
abrogation
with
no
diligence,
no
fault
or
any
other
factor.
and
our
primary
position
is
that
you
should
simply
apply
the
plain
language
of
2244(d)(1)(d).
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
he
--
he
does
say
that,
and
we
read
that
as
a
concession
that
sometimes
if
you
wait
too
long,
that
can
actually
trump
a
claim
of
actual
innocence.
and
so,
at
a
minimum,
our
alternative
position
is
that
you
have
to
act
with
diligence.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
we
think
it--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--but,
justice
sotomayor,
it
--
it
represents
the
same
kind
of
principle,
you've
got
to
act
quickly
or
adverse
consequences
can
happen.
but
what
diligence
does
that
his
rule
doesn't
do
is
it
recognizes
this
compelling,
countervailing
state
interest
in
having
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
investigate
evidence
as
soon
as
it's
discovered.
now
--
and
the
problem
here,
we
don't
have
any
issue
at
all
if
it
takes
10,
15,
100
years
to
find
new
evidence,
but
once
you
have
that
evidence,
the
burden
is
on
him
to
come
forward
so
that
the
state
has
the
opportunity
to
investigate.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
justice
kennedy,
there's
a
very
simple
solution
to
that
problem.
if
he
gets
close
to
the
end
of
his
year
and
he
thinks
that
that
next
affidavit
might
be
just
around
the
corner
but
he
doesn't
have
it
yet,
all
he
has
to
do
is
file
a
protective
habeas
petition
with
the
district
court,
ask
for
a
stay,
and
say
i'm
still
diligently
pursuing
what
i
think
is
going
to
be
another
affidavit.
and
if
he
can't
find
that
next
affidavit,
you
litigate
it
on
the
merits,
and
if
he
does,
then
he
amends
his
petition
and
then
you
hear
it.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
two
thoughts
on
that.
first,
we
already
see
this
in
the
exhaustion
area.
there
are
petitioners
who
are
concerned
that,
notwithstanding
statutory
tolling
for
pursuing
state
remedies,
that
while
they're
monkeying
around
in
state
court,
they
might
somehow
be
time-barred
from
bringing
their
federal
claim.
so,
we
see
this
all
the
time
in
the
sixth
circuit,
you
know,
in
michigan
in
particular,
that
someone
will
file
their
petition
and
ask
for
a
stay
while
they
exhaust
state
remedies.
so,
you
know,
that
the
pile
really
isn't
going
to
be
any
different
than
it
is
right
now.
but
the
key
difference
between
that
scenario
and
the
scenario
that
perkins
proposes
is
that
when
you
have
him
file
something,
the
state's
on
notice
they
have
an
opportunity
to
investigate.
now
here,
we
have
his
last
affidavit
from
the
dry
cleaning
clerk,
and
it's
10
years
old.
so
even
if
michigan
could
find
that
person,
there's
no
way
for
us
to
meaningfully
cross-examine
her
and
investigate
what
she
really
knew
or
didn't
know
when
she
wrote
that
affidavit
10
years
ago.
and
so
with
the
file
and
stay,
you
preserve
all
of
the
rights,
but
yet
you
get
the
state,
the
countervailing
interest
that
the
statute
was
meant
to
protect.
and
i
do
want
to--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--sure.
and
that's
a
very
practical
question
that
i'd
like
to
address.
most
of
the
habeas
petitioners
don't
have
lawyers,
but
filing
the
habeas
petition
itself
is
not
something
that
takes
great
difficulty.
every
district
court
on
their
web
site
has
a
place
where
you
click
for
forms.
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
when
you
click
that
the
very
first
two
entries
are
habeas
petitions
for
federal
prisoners
and
state
prisoners.
and
it's
a
relatively
simple
form,
you
check
some
boxes,
say
when
your
conviction
was,
and
you
write
your
claim.
and
then
every
federal
district
court
in
the
country
has
full-time
pro
se
staff
attorneys
who
go
through
these
pro
se
petitions,
and
if
there
is
a
legitimate
claim
there,
then
they
can
work
that
up
for
the
judge
if
necessary
and
the
state
will
respond.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
we're
very
confused
about
that,
too.
they
do
say
in
their
opinion
that
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
he's
got
evidence
of
actual
innocence.
now,
as
you
just
pointed
out,
judge
bell
in
the
district
court
already
made
that
determination,
so
maybe
they're
contemplating
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
some
further
investigation,
but
it
is
curious
because--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--we
agree
with
that
100
percent,
so--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
believe
that
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
michigan,
that
because
he
confessed
to
his
friends
both
before
and
after--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
believe
that
the
sixth
circuit
argument
did
focus
on
the
question
of
diligence.
but,
you
know,
our
opinion
would
be
that
even
if
this
court
would
use,
you
know,
what
we
call
equitable
abrogation
to
kind
of
wipe
away
the
1-year
limitations
period,
and
you
would
also
disagree
on
diligence,
and
we
don't
think
you
should
do
that,
that
you
would
still
reverse
because
there's
nothing
left
to
be
done
in
the
district
court.
this
is
not
a
case
that
rises
to
the
very,
very
high
threshold
of
proving
actual
innocence
based
on
new
evidence.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
statutory
language.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
that
leaves
you
with
a
reversal
in
any
of
those
three
instances.
we
think
that
you
should
address
the
circuit
split,
which
is
the
important
question
of
do
we
apply
the
limitations
period.
and
to
turn
to
that,
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
set
up
an
analytical
construct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
oh,
no,
it
wouldn't
be
an
advisory
opinion.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i'm
saying
that's
an
alternative
ground
to
get
to
the
same
place.
but
the
sixth
circuit's
holding
was,
consistent
with
some
other
circuits,
that
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
here,
that
you
can
get
by
with
equitable
abrogation,
as
we
call
it.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
i
--
i
think
you're
wholly
within
your
right
to
address
the
merits
question,
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that.
the
analytical
construct
i
want
to
set
up
is
that
we've
got
three
different
categories
of
prisoners
who
claim
actual
innocence
based
on
new
evidence.
in
the
first
category,
they
used
that
new
evidence
only
to
try
to
establish
innocence
with
no
constitutional
claim.
and
in
herrera
you
say
no
federal
habeas
remedy
for
that;
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts,
executive
clemency,
prosecutorial
discharging
of
verdicts,
and
things
like
that.
the
second
category
is
where
you
have
a
prisoner
who
uses
new
evidence
as
a
gateway.
it's
not
related
to
the
constitutional
claim
that
they
assert
--
the
true
schlup
gateway.
and
that's
not
actually
this
case
either
and
you
could
reserve
that
question,
although
i'm
happy
to
talk
about
that.
the
case
we
have
here
is
the
third
instance,
where
the
evidence
of
actual
innocence,
the
new
evidence,
is
the
factual
predicate
for
the
claim.
and
you
could
not
find
a
provision
more
on
all
fours
with
that
category
than
what
congress
did
in
2244(d)(1)(d).
and
we
know
congress
was
thinking
about
actual
innocence
in
schlup.
for
those
of
you
who
are
interested
in
the
context,
in
the
legislative
debate
in
'95
and
'96
before
aedpa's
enactment
we
have
senators
feingold
and
kennedy
and
dodd,
among
others,
talking
about
how
this
new
statute
is
going
to
eliminate
claims
of
actual
innocence
based
on
new
evidence.
in
fact,
senator
feingold
even
mentioned
the
schlup
decision.
and
yet
congress
adopts
2244(d)(1)(d)
and
all
the
rest
of
the
provisions
by
a
91
to
8
vote.
so,
congress
had
this
court's
decision
in
schlup
in
the
back
of
its
mind,
it
considered
this
particular
construct
and
it
said
no,
we
want
a
1-year
limitations
period.
i
do
want
to--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
and
in
the
herrera
case,
there
is
no
constitutional
claim.
so
there
is
no
factual
predicate.
it's
just
a
stand-alone
“
i'm
innocent
”
claim.
and
this
court
has
said,
appropriately
so,
that
the
federal
habeas
remedy
doesn't
cover
that.
you
know,
if
you
think
about
the
remedies
you
can
get
from
state
courts,
from
prosecutors,
from
executive
clemency,
it's
rather
a
big
circle,
and
aedpa
is
a
much
smaller
circle
that's
subsumed
in
that.
and
you
recognize
in
herrera
that
just
because
you
don't
fall
within
the
habeas
circle
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
get
relief.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
examples
that
the
amici
briefs
cite
on
the
respondent's
side,
in
almost
every
case
the
final
decision
is
motivated
by
state
action.
there's
a
governor
who
grants
clemency
in
a
couple
of
cases,
there's
a
state
attorney
general's
office
that
dismisses
charges
in
others,
county
prosecutors
who
do
the
same.
one
which
the
amicus
brief
characterizes
as
a
habeas
grant
is
actually
the
illinois
court
of
appeals
in
a
state
proceeding
reversing.
you
know,
what
the
--
these
are
the
best
examples
that
they
have
for
why
you
need
an
equitable
abrogation
rule
and
yet
in
the
vast
majority
of
those
cases,
it's
the
state
system
that's
solving
the
problem.
now,
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
what
i
think
is
--
is
the
trickiest
question
and
that's,
justice
kennedy,
the
second
category
of
prisoners,
those
who
are
using
actual
innocence
to
prove,
not
their
underlying
constitutional
claim,
but
simply
the
schlup
gateway.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
even
there
congress
has
closed
the
door
with
2244(d)(1)(d).
and
the
best
way
to
understand
that
is
by
looking
two
subprovisions
earlier
in
the
second
and
successive
petitions
category.
and
this
argument
that
i'm
going
to
make
now
is
a
little
bit
different
than
the
way
we
did
it
in
the
brief,
which
was,
you
know,
they
had
it
there,
they
--
they
don't
have
it
here.
if
you
look
at
2244--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
the
--
the
contextual
point
that
i
was
making
was
that
congress
knew
about
schlup,
it
was
brought
up
in
the
debate
that
this
was
essentially
changing
the
schlup
rule
and
allowing
someone
who
claims
actual
innocence
not
to
present
their
claim,
and
congress
swept
those
objections
aside
by
a
91
to
8
vote.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
they
were
talking
in
the
--
the
legislative
record
just
generally
about
actual
innocence
and
claims
of
miscarriage
of
justice.
so
the
textual
argument
that
i
want
to
present
involving
successive
petitions
is
that
when
you're
looking
at
2244,
you
flow
from
successive
petitions
down
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
what
that
means
is
that
if
you
have
a
successive
petition,
congress
requires
you
to
prove
actual
innocence
and
diligence,
and
you
still
have
to
prove
that
you
satisfied
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
seventh
circuit
recognized
this
in
the
escamilla
case.
so
what
that
means
is
that,
even
when
congress
had
a
situation
where
they
knew
that
someone
had
presented
evidence
that
would
satisfy
a
heightened
actual
innocence
standard,
they
still
required
that
you
satisfy
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i'm
relying
on
2244(b),
which
is
the
successive
petition
provision.
it
requires
you
to
first
prove
that
you've
got
evidence
of
actual
innocence
and
then
also
demonstrate
that
you
had
diligence.
and
after
you're
already
gotten
through
what
i'll
call
the
actual
innocence
statutory
gateway,
you're
still
required
to
satisfy
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
congress
was
concerned
about
schlup
and
wanted
to
make
a
situation
where
someone
with
evidence
of
actual
innocence
did
not
have
to
comply
with
the
limitations
period,
they
would
have
put
an
exception
in
the
successive
petition
sub-provision
and
they
didn't
do
that,
so--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--unfortunately,
the
text
is
not
there,
no.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
well,
as
we
explained
in
the
briefs,
the
fact--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
as
we
explained
in
the
briefs,
both
parties
rely
on
that.
the
fact
that
you
have
an
actual
innocence
exception
only
two
sub-provisions
earlier
is
strong
reason
to
think
congress
didn't
intend
it
here.
but
i'm
making
a
different
argument
now,
which
is--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--which
is
simply
that
congress
considered
the
--
the
instance
where
you
establish
a
statutory
actual-innocence
gateway
in
(b)(2),
the
successive
petition,
and
still
require
that
it
be
timely
filed,
because
the
state's
interest
in
having
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
investigate
is
so
important.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
this
is
not.
what
i'm
using
the
successive
petition
provision
to
demonstrate
is
that,
consistent
with
the
legislative
history,
congress
is
demonstrating
here
in
2244(d)(1)(d)
that
there
is
no
special
actual-innocence--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes,
i
am--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
my
--
my
point
is
that
if
congress
anticipated
that
actual
innocence
could
be
a
gateway
to
circumvent
the
limitations
period,
then
certainly
they
would
have
put
that
exception
in
the
successive
petition
of
(b)(2)
where
they
said,
all
right,
if
you
establish
actual
innocence,
we're
still
going
to
make
you
comply
with
the
limitations
period.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
and
if
you
would--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--if
he
was
right
about
that,
then
in
(b),
you
would
also
see
another
provision
that
says
and
anyone
who
satisfies
this
statutory
actual-innocence
standard
doesn't
have
to
apply
with
the
limitations
period.
and
we
think
that
--
that's
dispositive.
now,
you
know,
when
we--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
the
history
of
this
statute
and
of
the
case
law
isn't
quite
that
way.
and
--
and
i
want
to
draw
a
sharp
distinction
between
this
case
and
holland
with
respect
to
history.
with
respect
to
equitable
tolling,
you
did
have
decisions
going
back
to
the
1800s
recognizing
that
federal
statutes
of
limitation
in
all
kinds
of
contexts,
civil
and
criminal,
were
subject
to
equitable
tolling.
and
so
then
in
irwin,
6
years
before
aedpa,
you
actually
create
a
presumption
that
if
congress
doesn't
specifically,
you
know,
exclude
equitable
tolling--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
now
i'm
going
to
move
to
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
so
the
cause
and
effect,
the
manifest
injustice,
the
actual
innocence,
really
starts
to
develop
in
1986,
and
it
comes
to
fruition
in
schlup
in
1995
right
before
aedpa
is
passed.
importantly,
that
exception
was
always
applied
to
court-created
procedural
bars,
never
once
to
a
federal
statute
of
limitations.
and
obviously,
the
separation
of
powers
considerations
are
quite
different
when
you're
talking
about
a
court-created
exception
to
a
court-created
bar.
the
first
is
a
bar
that's
enforced
by
congress
itself.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
because
it
was
the
court
itself
that
created
the
judicial
exception
to
the
state
filing.
and
so
then
--
or
i'm
sorry,
that
created
the
bar
with
respect
to
the
state
filing.
and
so
then
it
was
completely
within
the
court's
power
to
make
an
exception
to
that
bar.
but
again
here,
the
separation
of
powers
considerations
militate
differently
when
you're
talking
about
congress
doing
the
telling,
and
this
court
has
acknowledged
in
launcher
and
dodd
and
other
places
that
congress
gets
to
set
the
parameters
of
habeas.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
it
was
a
very
short
background,
one
with
no
irwin-like
presumption
and
one
that,
again,
had
never
ever
been
applied
to
a
federal
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
because
it's
congress
and
congress
is
the
one
that's
handcuffing
the
court
with
respect
to
the
scope
of--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--but
here's
another
way
to
think
about
it.
you
know,
if
you
imagine
the
--
the
template
that
you
have
on
your
microsoft
word
when
you're
doing
a
document,
an
opinion,
whatever,
you've
got
certain
stuff
that's
on
the
template,
and
you
said
in
irwin
that
when
it
comes
to
equitable
tolling,
you've
always
got
a
sub-provision
v,
call
it,
in
every
federal
statute
of
limitations
that
appears
on
that
template.
and
so
congress
has
to
do
something
affirmatively
to
strike
that
out.
because
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
had
never
been
applied
to
any
federal
--
federal
statute
of
limitations,
there
wasn't
a
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
sitting
on
the
template.
congress
was
writing
from
scratch.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
the
biggest
reason
is
because
of
the
state
interest
in
notice
and
investigating
the
evidence.
when
you're
talking
about
the
typical
schlup
claim--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
no,
there
--
there
you
have
stale
claims,
but
you
don't
have
stale
evidence.
and,
you
know,
we
--
we
don't
have
any
problem
with
litigating
a
claim
that
could
have
been
litigated
earlier
and
is
going
to
be
litigated
now.
but
the
world
of
evidence,
the
record
that
supports
the
claim,
is
already
defined
and
is
not
going
to
change.
the
world
we're
dealing
with
in
2244(d)(1)(d)
is
when
new
stuff
has
come
forward
and
if
that
new
stuff
sits
in
the
jailhouse
cell
for
10,
20,
30
years
and
we
don't
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
those
witnesses,
to
do
counter-investigation,
then
not
only
are
we
prejudiced
with
respect
to
delay
and
finality
and
things
like
that,
but
we're
prejudiced
with
respect
to
the
merits
determination
of
what
that
evidence
means.
and
when
i
talked
about
my
three
constructs,
you
know,
this
case
here
where
you're
using
the
old
evidence
to
establish
the
underlying
claim,
that's
really
the
position
where
the
state
is
in
the
worst
possible
position,
because
now
you've
got
a
--
you
know,
the
dry
cleaning
clerk
affidavit,
a
10-year-old
affidavit,
we
can't
possibly
cross-examine
her,
and
yet
not
only
is
that
their
gateway,
that's
their
substantive
merits
claim
about
why
there
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
it'll
be
very
difficult.
and
there
are
some
examples
in
the
amici
briefs
of
the
new
york
case,
for
example,
where
witnesses
were
completely
unavailable.
they
had
died
or
one
was
out
of
state
and
because
of
mental
infirmities
could
not
travel.
you
know,
we
all
know
that
as
time
passes
evidence
deteriorates,
whether
it's
because
of
--
of
death
or
illness
or
simply
forgetfulness.
i
certainly
can't
remember
what
i
was
doing
10
years
ago
today.
and
the
affidavit
that
she
submitted
was
quite
short.
and
that
one
affidavit
is
just
a
microcosm
of
the
problem
when
you
don't
come
forward
immediately
with
evidence.
one
other
point
that
i
want
to
make
really
on
the
equities
here,
because
we're
spending
a
lot
of
time
on
that--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right.
the
number
that
win
is
small.
but
what
this
case
demonstrates
is
that
the
number
where
it's
claimed
is
very
high.
in
fact,
in
michigan,
you
know,
where
we
deal
with
procedural
defaults
every
day,
somewhere
between
a
third
and
a
half
of
our
petitioners
claimed
actual
innocence
so
that
they
can
use
schlup
to
get
past
the
--
the
failure
to
prove
cause
and
prejudice.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
in
the
sixth
circuit,
a
little
more
than
in
some
other
circuits,
but
generally,
not
very
many--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--you
know.
but
this
case
is
the
perfect
example.
when
you
cut
the
court
loose
from
the
statutory
requirement,
you
end
up
with
what
justice
alito
is
describing,
you
know,
a
situation
where
no
one
thinks
that
mr.
perkins
is
actually
innocent
based
on
this
new
evidence;
at
best,
it
proves
that
he
had
a
co-conspirator
who
helped
him
commit
the
murder
together.
and
yet
now
we've
got
the
sixth
circuit
order,
which
purportedly
sends
us
back
to
the
trial
court
to
do,
you
know,
who
knows
what?
how
do
you
prove
that
he's
not
innocent?
well,
a
jury
already
did
that.
the
jury
heard
all
the
evidence,
they
had
a
presumption
of
innocence.
all
the
constitutional
rules
that
should
have
been
were
applied
to
that
trial,
and
the
jury
said
he's
guilty
and
there's
not
a
presumption
of
innocence
anymore.
and
--
and
the
equitable
point
that
i
wanted
to
touch
on
is
that
this
is
not
just
about
prejudicing
the
state's
interest.
if
you
allow
claims
like
these
to
go
forward,
it
also
prejudices
those
who
have
legitimate
claims
of
actual
innocence,
the
needle
in
the
haystack.
and
justices
o'connor
and
kennedy
in
their
herrera
concurrence
talked
about
the
haystack
problem,
that
when
you
keep
adding
hay
to
that
pile,
not
only
is
it
harder
to
find
the
needle,
the
truly
meritorious
claim,
but
at
some
point
the
federal
judges
just
give
up
and
they
stop
looking.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
because
there
are
so
many.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
it's
important
to
understand
that
--
that
notwithstanding
the
limits
that
congress
was
trying
to
put
on
these
habeas
petitions
when
it
enacted
aedpa,
that
we
actually
have
more
habeas
filings
on
an
annual
basis
today
than
we
did
before
aedpa
was
enacted.
it's
not
going
to
stop
the
filing.
this
is
just
one
small
rule
to
cut
the
haystack
down
a
little
bit
and
make
it
that
much
easier
to
find
the
needle.
and
if
you
can
find
that
occasional
needle
--
and
we
submit
there's
not
a
lot
of
those
--
federal
judges
are
going
to
be
more
inclined
to
look
for
those.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
that
is
not
our
position.
and
i
want
to
be
really
clear
about
this.
first
they've
got
the
year,
but
if
they
go
past
the
year,
they've
got
the
state
system.
and
what
the
examples
in
the
amici
briefs
demonstrate
is
that--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--no,
they
don't.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
but
as
the
alabama
amici
brief
explains,
every
state
has
got
a
process
for
curing
these
claims
no
matter
how
old
they
are.
you've
also
got
the
prosecutors
who
look
at
these
and
they
don't
want
to
keep
an
innocent
person
in
jail.
and
then
lastly,
you've
got
clemency,
which
this
court
has
always
recognized
as
the
remedy
for
those
who
assert
true,
actual
innocence
but
have
no
constitutional
violation
to
assert.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
three
brief
points
about
holland,
and
some
closing
thoughts
about
diligence.
with
respect
to
holland,
i
want
to
note
first
of
all
that
there,
you
were
dealing
with
legislative
assignments.
everyone
agreed
that
congress
had
not
done
anything
about
equitable
tolling.
and
as
i
explained
earlier,
when
you
consider
the
three
categories
of
defendants
who
claim
actual
innocence
based
on
new
evidence,
this
situation
here,
where
the
new
evidence
relates
to
a
factual
predicate
of
the
constitutional
claim
asserted,
that's
where
congress
most
clearly
meant
to
have
a
limitations
period
apply.
so
it's
very
different.
with
respect
to
equitable
tolling
applying
to
acts
of
congress,
everyone
recognizes
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
note
that
this
has
never
been
applied
to
limitations.
i
actually
have
to
take
issue
with
my
friend's
statement
that
sanders
and
kuhlmann
somehow
took
a
different
tack,
because
in
both
of
those
cases,
what
congress
did
is
it
left
it
to
the
district
judge's
discretion
to
do
or
not
do
something.
and
all
this
court
said
was
well,
if
they've
got
discretion,
then
they
can
still
have
an
equitable
exception.
so
even
in
those
cases,
this
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
has
never
ever
been
used
to
override
a
congressional
act.
the
last
thing
is
that
in
equitable
tolling,
you
are
dealing
with
the
fault
of
the
petitioner
--
hurricane
katrina
or
something
else
happened,
that
wasn't
their
fault.
and
here,
it's
entirely
within
the
petitioner's
control.
all
they
have
to
do
is
print
the
form,
check
the
boxes,
attach
the
evidence
and
then
file
the
claim.
and
they
have
an
unlimited
time
to
find
evidence
and
then
1
year
after
that,
to
file.
now,
with
respect
to
diligence--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
let
me
explain
that
and
i'm
glad
you
raised
that
because,
you
know,
besides
the
legislative
history
that
informs
what
we
are
looking
at
here,
what
they
did
in
2244(d)(1)(d)
is
they
made
it
broader.
they
said
even
if
you
don't
claim
innocence,
if
you
are
coming
forward
with
new
evidence
we
want
the
court
to
hear
that
constitutional
claim
if
you
bring
it
within
one
year.
the
reason
they
didn't
mention
it
there
is
because
it
would
have
made
the
provision
narrower
and
they
didn't
want
to
do
that.
then
they
ratcheted
it
up
with
respect
to
successive
petitions,
making
you
pass
through
the
successive
petition
actual-innocence
gateway
and
then
comply
with
the
limitations
period.
so
that's
the
explanation
consistent
were
with
legislative
history.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right,
they
could
have,
but
again,
that
would
have
limited
(d)(1)(d).
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
if
they
said
there
is
an
exception
for
those
who
claim
actual
innocence,
the
implication
is
for
those
who
don't
claim
actual
innocence,
you
are
out
of
luck.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
if
we
could
rewrite
congressional
statutes
with
hindsight,
maybe
we
could
draft
a
perfect
statute.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
that's
not
the
way
that
we
interpret
this
at
all.
under
either
provision,
you
are
stuck
with
(d)(1)(d),
you
have
got
to
file
within
a
year.
all
that
the
successive
provision
adds
to
it
is
that
you
do
have
a
statutory
actual
innocence
gateway
to
pass
through
first
that
you
don't
have
on
our
first
petition.
that's
our
position.
i
do
want
to
close
with
some
thoughts
about
diligence.
you
know,
looking
for
counsel,
we've
talked
about
how
simple
it
is
to
file
these
things.
the
papers
lost
in
the
prison
riot
and
the
access
to
the
library
are
related,
and
it's
because
defendant
perkins
incited
the
prison
riot,
so
he
is
hardly
in
an
equitable
position
of
claiming
any
tolling
benefit
from
that.
and
with
respect
to
the
rule,
justice
breyer,
we
can't
have
a
diligence
rule
if
you
go
to
that
point
based
on
intent
because
the
interest
that
is
being
vindicated
here
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
petitioner--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--as
long
as
it
takes
into
account
that
the
state
interest
in
timeliness
is
at
its
apex
when
we
are
dealing
with
new
evidence
that
relates
to
the
actual
constitutional
claim.
and
they
are
asking
for
not
equitable
tolling,
but
extraordinary
tolling
that
you
should
reject.
