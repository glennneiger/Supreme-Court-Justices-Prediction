justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
does
this
boil
down
to
--
i
mean,
you
have
a
one-year
statute
of
limitations.
now,
i
guess
suppose
hurricane
katrina
came
along
and
threw
all
the
documents
away
for
two
months.
i
guess
the
court
could
extend
it,
couldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
mean,
don't
they
toll
it
when
there's
some
--
when
the
courthouse
burns
down?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you
want
to
say,
and
that's
also
true
when
the
person
is
actually
innocent
if
you
can
prove
that,
delay
it.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
has
his
one
year
and
he
gives
four
criteria.
and
the
four
criteria
sometimes
are
not
exclusive.
and
you
want
to
say
yours
is
one
of
the
times.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
a
different
one
you
say
is
when
he's
actually
innocent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
correct,
then
suppose
that
he
purposely
has
delayed
filing
this
until
everybody's
dead
so
they
know
they
can't
prove
it
anymore.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
is
your
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
can
he
toll
it
under
those
circumstances?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
answer
is
in
your
view,
if
he
deliberately
and
--
and
without
cause
delays
it
for
5
years
his
filing,
just
so
everybody
will
die,
you
would
say,
okay,
i'm
not
worried
about
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
would
you
or
wouldn't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
he
win
or
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
said
what
do
you
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
you
do.
i
made
up
the
hypothetical.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
trying
to
--
they
admit
that
if
he's
diligent,
it's
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
do
you
believe
he's
diligent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
state
is
asking
for
a
diligence
requirement.
you
admit
that
there's
a
requirement
that
--
that
you
have
to
not
really
use
this
as
a
sham
device,
so
we're
pretty
close.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
a
sham
--
there
is
a
sham
and
deliberate
delay
requirement,
not
a
diligence
one,
but
there
is
a
sham.
i'm
not
trying
to
trick
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
maybe
we're
arguing
about
something
that
we
could
solve.
that
is,
in
fact,
many
of
these
people
don't
have
lawyers.
they
don't
understand
the
statute
of
limitations,
they
don't
understand
what
diligence
might
consist
of
looking
later.
you
agree
that
it's
--
it
shouldn't
be
a
sham,
shouldn't
do
it
deliberately.
all
right.
now,
if
i'm
thinking
about
that,
how
would
you
advise
me
to
write
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
about
the
words
"discovered
in
exercise
of
due
diligence.
"
you
know,
you
could
manipulate
those
words
so
as
to
deal
with
the
circumstance
of
the,
say,
below-average
iq
person
who
doesn't
have
a
lawyer,
who
isn't
certain
about
what
to
do,
and
what
counts
as
diligence
and
discovery
in
that
case.
is
that
--
are
you
objecting
to
that?
do
you
object
to
that?
what
do
you
think?
