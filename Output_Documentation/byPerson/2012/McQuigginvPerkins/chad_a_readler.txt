mr.
chad
a.
readler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
with
justice
kagan's
question
regarding
the
important
background
interpretive
principle
here
that's
set
out,
set
out
in
holland.
there
the
court
held
that
longstanding
equitable
rules
in
the
habeas
context
are
incorporated
into
aedpa
barring
a
clear
command
by
congress
to
the
contrary.
and
the
longstanding
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
has
had
a
well-settled
meaning.
it
has
allowed
petitioners
who
can
meet
the
high
standing
of
showing
actual
innocence
a
procedural
gateway
around
a
procedural
bar
to
allow
them
to
present
their
otherwise
barred
constitutional
claims
in
federal
court.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
with
respect
to
justice
alito's
question,
the
reform
recommendation
from
the
magistrate
denied
this
petition
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds
solely,
and
said
it
was
too
late
and
it
missed
the
statutory
period.
at
the
district
court
level,
the
court
held
that
the
statute
of
limitations
was
missed
and
that
there
was
no
diligence;
the
court
believed
there
was
a
diligence
requirement
and
so
the
petition
failed
for
that
reason.
and
then,
as
justice
alito
noted,
the
court
added
some
other
language
which
said
--
was
not
a
weighing
of
the
evidence,
but
the
court
said
that
it
felt
that
the
evidence
was
not
new
in
the
sense
that
it
was
reasonably
--
potentially
reasonably
known
at
the
time
of
trial,
which
i
think
is
one
--
was,
one,
the
wrong
legal
standard
but,
two,
was
a
misinterpretation
of
schlup,
because
schlup
allows
you
to
consider
all
the
evidence,
old
and
new,
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
district
--
the
district
court
i
think
applied
the
wrong
legal
standard,
so
it
wasn't
actually
getting
to
the
merits.
it
didn't
sort
of
set
out
all
the
evidence
and
weigh
them.
and
then,
justice
ginsburg,
you
are
correct
that
this
was
not
part
of
the
certificate
of
appealability.
the
certificate
of
appealability
was
limited
on
the
narrow
question
of
whether
there
was
a
diligence
requirement.
that
factual
issue
was
not
before
the
sixth
circuit
and
hasn't
--
it
is
not
before
this
court
as
well,
and
what
i
think
this
court
should
do
is
what
it
did
in
schlup,
which
is
announce
the
standard
that
should
apply
and
then
it
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
for
application
of
the
correct
standards.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
justice
alito,
i
don't
read
the
sixth
--
or
i
don't
read
the
district
court
as
actually
getting
to
the
merits.
i
think
it
applied
a
wrong
legal
rule
and
said,
i
can't
even
consider
the
evidence
because
it's
not
new
evidence.
i
think
that
was
an
erroneous
interpretation.
under
schlup,
the
court
has
said
many
times
that
the
court
can
consider
all
the
evidence
old
and
new.
and
i
think
that
case
really
turns
on
the
equitable
tolling--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--well,
our
client
was
acting
pro
se.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
justice
alito,
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
that
in
front
of
me.
i
don't
recall
the
full
contours
of
what
he
requested.
the
certificate,
the
sixth
circuit
granted
it
on
the
one
narrow
issue
of
whether
diligence
was
a
requirement.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice.
those
cases
are
on
pages
36
to
38
of
the
red
brief
and
i
think
my
friend
and
i
have
a
disagreement
here.
it's
true
that
the
rule
has
never
been
applied
to
the
statute
of
limitations
because
there
was
no
statute
of
limitations
for
aedpa
before
the
statute.
but
the
court
has
applied
the
exception
to
acts
of
congress.
it
did
so
in
sanders.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
incorrect
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
federal
statute
of
limitations
before
aedpa.
but
the
court
had
applied
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
to
acts
of
congress.
so,
for
instance,
in
sanders,
congress
had
included
in
2244
an
ends-of-justice
provision
which
seemed
to
allow
the
court
to
consider
the
ends
of
justice
when
considering
whether
to
hear
a
successive
petition,
which
is
essentially
the
equivalent
of
miscarriage
of
justice.
it
did
not
include
that
language
in
2255,
and
yet
the
court
read
2255
as
also
including
the
ends-of-justice
requirement,
hence
the
miscarriage
of
justice,
even
though
the
language
wasn't
there.
in
kuhlmann--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--for
federal,
federal
petitions.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
federal
convictions.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
there
were
--
there
were
--
there
were
--
there
was
language
in
both,
in
both
statutes
regarding
when
you
could
bring
a
successive
petition.
the
statute
that
applied
to
petitions
out
of
state
judgment,
2254,
included
an
ends-of-justice
provision
which
said
the
court
could
consider
the
ends
of
justice
in
deciding
whether
to
take
a
second
or
successive
petition.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
substantive
--
well,
no.
procedural
limits,
procedural
limits
on
--
procedural
limits.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
we
do.
in
--
in
--
now,
these
would
be
state
time
limits,
but--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
have
never
been
any
time
limits.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
i
think
i
can
agree
with
that
because
there
was
never
a
statute
of
limitations
before
aedpa.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
two
responses:
first,
with
respect
to
the
timing
issue,
the
court
had
applied
the
miscarriage-of-justice
exception
to
abusive
petitions,
so
there
is
a
timing
concern
invoked
there
because
you're
filing
a
second
petition
when
you
could
have
raised
issues
earlier,
and
the
court
has
said
even
in
that
timing
context,
not
a
statute
of
limitations,
but
it
certainly
invokes
timing
concerns,
that
even
in
that
instance
the
miscarriage
of
justice
would
still
overcome
the
rule.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
justice
alito,
i
suspect
few
of
them
could
credibly
say--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--well,
i
haven't
done
that
study.
i
suspect
very
few
of
them
would
say
that
they
--
credibly
say
that
they
are
actually
innocent.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
should--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--absolutely,
justice
alito,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
background
presumption,
of
course,
given
the
established
nature
of
this
exception
--
in
fact,
on
mr.
chief
justice's
question,
while
this
exception
as
compared
to
equitable
tolling
in
the
criminal
context,
i
think
is
actually
more
important
because
it
goes
to
the
ultimate
equity
and
that
is
innocence.
but
the
background
presumption
is
that
congress
includes
these
foundational
equitable
rules
of
which
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
is
absolutely
one
of
them,
unless
congress
expressly
says
otherwise.
now,
justice
alito,
no
--
no
petitioner
is
going
to
want
to
find
themselves
in
the
schlup
world
where
they
missed
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
is
not
a
place
they
are
going
to
want
to
be.
they
are
going
to
absolutely
want
to
file
within
a
year
if
they
can.
sometimes
they
miss
that
period
and
what
the
court
has
said,
in
those
rare
circumstances
where
you
can
make
a
credible,
compelling
showing
of
actual
innocence,
we
will
allow
you
around
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
no
petitioner
wants
to
be
in
that
circumstance
because
the
schlup
standard
is
so
high.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
and
the
statue
speaks
to
that.
i
mean,
i
think
we
do
have
a
disagreement
on
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
2244(d)(1)(d)
does
speak
to
the
discovery
of
new
evidence
which
goes
to
support
a
claim.
i
think
congress--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
to
the
extent
that
the
evidence
goes
to
support
a
claim.
congress
included
a
typical
discovery
rule.
if
you've
discovered
new
evidence
that
--
that
supports
the
factual
underpinnings
of
your
claim,
that
starts
the
one-year
period
over
again.
but
critically
--
and
i
think
my
friend
and
i
have
a
disagreement
here
--
critically,
with
respect
to
that
provision,
if
you
find
evidence
that
solely
goes
to
your
innocence,
that
provision
is
not
triggered.
meaning
you
don't
get
another
year
if
you
find
completely
exculpatory
evidence
that
shows
you're
not
innocent,
you
don't
--
you
don't
necessarily
get
another
year.
and
there's
a
hypothetical
i
can
give
you.
if
your
underlying
claims
is
a
batson
claim,
a
structural
error
claim
and
you
fail
to
raise
it
and
you
missed
the
one-year
limitations
period,
but
then
10
years
later,
you
find
dna
evidence
that
completely
exonerates
your
client
that
was
unknown
to
anyone,
so
it's
not
the
basis
for
an
iec
claim,
it's
not
the
basis
for
prosecutorial
misconduct,
in
that
instance,
the
statute
doesn't
start
the
limitations
period
over.
you're
entirely
out
of
luck,
which
is
why
congress
had
to
have
meant
to
include
the
absolute
--
the
innocence
exception
for
just
that
kind
of
case,
so
that
petitioner
at
least
has
the
ability
to
try
to
meet
the
schlup
standard.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
alito,
in
the
sense
that
all
this
is,
is
a
gateway
to
allow
them
their
first
opportunity
to
bring
a
federal
habeas
petition.
ordinarily,
they're
out
of
luck.
but
if
they
brought
evidence
that
is
so
compelling
that
shows
that
there
may
well
have
been
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
because
this
person
has
shown
under
the
substandard
they're
actually
innocent,
then
in
that
instance,
the
court
has
always
said
that
we're
going
to
allow
those
claims
to
be
heard,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
by
a
federal
court
for
a
first
petition.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
sure
that's
practical
to
the
extent
that
we've
already
raised
our
underlying
constitutional
claims
in
the
state
court.
those
have
been
exhausted.
so
the
michigan
rule,
as
i
read
it,
doesn't
allow
us
to
go
back
to
state
court
and
present
our
constitutional
claims
again.
they've
already
been
adjudicated.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
the
innocence
evidence
may
--
you
may
be
able
to
pursue
that
under
--
under
the
--
under
the
state
rule,
but
that
is
more
akin
to
a
freestanding--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--well,
two
responses.
one,
i
think
every
state
has
different
rules
until
this
--
the
application
of
the
exception
is
never
turned
on
sort
of
what
the
alternative
potential
state
rule
is.
that
wasn't
--
that
was
true
in
house
and
true
in
schlup
where
there
were
state
alternatives.
but,
too,
those
state
alternatives
go
to
freestanding
innocence
claims,
where
you're
not
--
you're
not
alleging
that
there's
an
underlying
constitutional
violation.
what
you're
saying
is,
similar
to
herrera,
and
that
is,
that
i
have
evidence
that
shows
setting
aside
any
error
of
the
trial,
no
errors,
i
have
evidence
that
shows
i'm
innocent.
that's
a
completely
different
concept.
and
what
we're
getting
at
here
is
the
case
where
you
wanted
evidence
of
innocence,
and
two,
have
a
constitutionally
corrupt
trial
or
at
least
an
allegation
of
a
constitutionally
corrupt
trial.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
justice
alito,
for
decades
this
court
has
never
required
diligence
and,
in
fact,
in
mccloskey
has
expressly
rejected
it
and
the
court
has
noted
that
diligence
has
not
historically
been
required
under
the
standard,
because
as
the
court
said
in
house
and
calderon,
that
congress
raised
the
bar
in
two
places
on
the
statute.
but
the
reason
why
is
because
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
her
concurring
opinion
with
--
with
--
in
withrow
with
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
innocence
is
the
ultimate
equity.
and
it
trumps
--
diligence
is
not
the
ultimate
equity,
it's
innocence.
and
if
a
petitioner
can
come
forward
and
make
a
credible
showing
of
actual
innocence,
that
standing
alone
has
always
been
enough
to
allow
a
federal
court
to
at
least
go
ahead
and
then
reach
the
underlying
claim.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
court
has
always
treated
the
phrase
“
miscarriage
of
justice
”
as
synonymous
with
actual
innocence,
and
that's
the
one
thing
it's
getting
at.
it's
a
narrow
exception,
it's
difficult
to
meet,
but
--
but
it's
always
included
cases
where
you
can
make--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--well,
that
would
presumably
be
the
basis
for
a
habeas
claim.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--justice
kennedy,
i'm
relying
on
the
court's
decades
of
decisions,
many
of
which
you've
written
in
this
area,
where
they've
described
miscarriage
of
justice
in
the
habeas
setting
as
the
equivalent
of
incarceration
of
an
innocent
person
and
that's
what
the
exception
is
getting
at.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
that
could
be
viewed
as
an
impediment
under
--
under
the
statute,
there's
a
statutory
provision
for--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--it
could
also
be
based
on
tolling,
correct.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
i'm
not
sure
if
i
fully
understand
the
question.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
that's
--
that's
true.
they're
not
exclusive.
and
a--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--that's
--
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
then
that
raises
a
whole--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--different
range
of--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--well,
any
--
as
the
court
said
in
schlup,
the
timing
of
the
submission
by
the
petitioner
can
certainly
be
considered
in
the
schlup
analysis.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
justice
breyer--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--i
would
say
--
i
would
say
that
he
can
still
attempt
to
avail
himself
of
the
federal
miscarriage
of
justice
exception,
but
the
huge
problem
he's
going
to
run
into--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--he
likely
--
he
may
well
lose.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
he
may
well
lose
at
the
schlup
stage.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
i
don't
have
all
the
facts,
i
suspect
he's
going
to
lose.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
justice
breyer,
on
those
facts
i'm
going
to
say
he
loses
at
the
schlup
stage
because
schlup,
which
is
one,
incredibly
high
bar
to
meet.
but
two,
the
court
expressly
said
at
page
322
of
the
opinion
that
it
could
consider
the
timing
of
the
evidence
when
it's
submitted.
so
it
already
takes
into
account
any
sort
of
game
playing
that
petitioner
may
engage
in
when
they're
trying
to
assert
their
innocence.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
the
state?
mr.
chad
a.
readler
we
believe
he's
diligent.
the
state
is
asking
for
a
diligence
requirement
that
the
court
has
never
imposed.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
there's
--
there's
never
been
a
diligence
requirement
in
this
setting,
because
that's
not
been
the
focus.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
no,
but--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--i
think
--
i
think
the
court
can
just
build
on
the
principles
it's
already
set
forward
in
schlup
and
other
places,
and
that
is,
that
there's
never
been
a
diligence
requirement
in
this
setting.
and
congress,
by
the
way,
did
not
--
the
congress
--
the
intent
of
congress
was
not
to
include
a
diligence
requirement
here
because
in
two
places
it
did
include
a
diligence
requirement
with
respect
to
successive
petitions
or
evidentiary
hearings,
so
congressional
intent
was
not
to
include
diligence--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--that's
correct,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
absolutely.
two
responses.
first,
just
with
respect
to
rule
9(a),
chief
justice
burger,
in
a
concurring
opinion
to
a
dissent
in
spalding
said
that
even
a
laches
rule
would
give
way
if
there
was
a
colorable
showing
of
actual
innocence.
with
respect
to
the
rule
i'd
write,
i
would
write
the
rule
that
is
essentially
already
in
place,
and
that
is
that
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
does
not
turn
on
diligence;
it
turns
on
whether
you
can
show
innocence.
and
in
--
in
attempting
to
show
innocence
under
schlup,
this
timing
--
the
timing
of
the
submissions
is
a
consideration.
so
if
there's
--
if
there's
been
a
delay
that
somehow
hurts
the
state
because
a
witness
has
died,
or
that
it
appears
to
be
that
that's
the
fault,
or
that
the
petitioner
was
playing
games
in
that
context,
i
think
it's
a
fair
consideration
under
schlup.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
it
depends.
if
--
if
the
petition
is
filed
3
weeks
after
the
star
witness
dies,
presumably
the
state
will
come
back
in
their
petition
and
note,
one,
all
the
evidence
that
they
think
goes
against
the
--
the
petitioner's
claim.
but
also,
they'll
note
that
this
happened,
and
the
court
could
resolve
it
at
that
stage,
too--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--a
number
of
reasons,
mr.
chief
justice.
one,
he
was
looking
for
counsel
to
assist
him.
two,
he
continued
to
look
for
evidence.
three,
he
didn't
have
access
to
his
legal
papers.
many
of
his
legal
papers
were
lost
in
a
prison
riot
and
then
a
flood
that
occurred
at
this
prison,
so
he
didn't
have
access
to
those
and
had
to
regain
those.
for
a
period
of
time,
he
was
denied
access
to
the
library
and
to
a
legal
writer.
so
there
were
a
culmination
of
reasons
why
he
didn't
do
this,
but
i
think
two
of
the
critical
ones
were
looking
for
counsel
and
trying
to
develop
more
evidence.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
justice
alito,
no
--
no
rational
petitioner
is
going
to
want
to
wait
in
that
period,
because
if
they
file
within
the
1-year
period,
they
go
straight
to
review
on
their
habeas
claims
and
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
any
procedural
gateway.
so
--
so
no
rational--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--well,
and
justice
alito,
you're
right,
we're
not
arguing
for
equitable
tolling
here
in
the
sense
that
he
could
have
filed
earlier.
there
wasn't
--
there
wasn't
a
state
impediment
that
stood
in
his
way
the
entire
period
of
time.
and
he
should
have
filed
it
earlier,
and
had
he
filed
earlier
then
he
would
have
gone
straight
to
consideration
of
his
underlying
habeas
claims
and
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
this
high
hurdle
of
satisfying--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--well,
no,
justice
alito,
you're
correct
that
aedpa
was
intended
to
delay
--
or
to
end
delay
when
possible
--
but
as
the
court
said
in
holland,
aedpa
was
not
meant
to
end
every
delay
at
all
costs.
i
think
this
is
exactly
the
situation
it
had
in
mind.
in
calderon,
the
court
recognized
that
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
is
consistent
with
aedpa
because
--
because
it
arises
so
rarely
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
the
finality
and
comity
concerns
that
the
state
has
are
honored,
because
there's
no
--
there's
no
additional
proceeding,
the
petitioner
will
not
meet
the
high
schlup
standard
and
the
case
will
end.
but
in
the
rare
case
where
a
petitioner
can
satisfy
schlup,
the
court
has
always
said
that
the
courthouse
doors
in
that
circumstance
will
be
open
to
review
of
your
first
federal
petition.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
i
think
ordinarily,
yes.
the
sixth
circuit
said
here
that
there
was
a
gateway,
and
it
was
remanding
the
case
back
to
the
district
court--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
well,
it's
correct
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
back
to
the
district
court,
just
like
this
case
--
just
like
the
court
did
in
schlup,
where
it
announced
the
standard
and
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
for
application.
but
here,
i
disagree
with
that
reading
of
the
underlying
opinion,
in
that
the
court
doesn't
set
out
into
the
weighing
all
the
evidence
and
saying
here's
what
i
find
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
here's
what
i
find
in
favor
of
the
state.
what
the
district
court
said
is
that
--
it
said
the
timing
of
the
evidence
was
somehow
a
problem
because
the
information
was
known
at
trial,
which
i
think
is
again
wrong
for
two
reasons.
i
think
the
petitioner
has
--
is
able
to
use
the
information,
because
the
problem
for
us
was
his
attorney
was
told
about
some
of
these
things
but
didn't
actually
assert
them,
or
didn't
interview
one
of
the
key
witnesses.
one
of
the
affiants
was
on
the
prosecution's
witness
list
and
my
client's
lawyer
didn't
even
interview
that
person,
let
alone
call
them.
and
then
the
court
--
i
think
the
court
--
the
trial
court
misunderstood
schlup,
because
schlup
allows
you
to
consider
all
the
evidence
old
and
new,
make
appropriate
credibility
determinations,
consider
the
timeliness
of
the
evidence,
and
determine
whether
that
standard
has
been
met.
and
i
think
that's
what
should
happen
here
for
the
first
time,
in
our
view.
and
there
is
a
question
--
there
was
a
question
earlier
with
respect
to
how
often
the
schlup
standard
is
met.
in
response
to
the
reply
brief,
we
did
a
search
of
circuit
courts.
and
we
found
since
schlup
was
decided
eight
circuits
that
have
upheld
or
have
found
that
schlup
was
satisfied.
if
you
add
in
house,
then
that
adds
nine
appellate
cases
where
schlup
was
satisfied.
so
it's
--
it's
a
narrow
range
of
cases.
it
shouldn't
be
difficult
to
meet,
but
we--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--sure.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suspect
no
matter
the
rules,
there
will
always
be
filings
by
petitioners,
and
many
of
those
may
be
frivolous.
but
as
the
court
has
said
in
panetti
and
other
cases,
you
know,
unmeritorious
petitions
can
be
dismissed
at
the
earliest
course,
and
it's
consistent
with
habeas
rule
4.
that's
what
should
happen
in
this
instance,
too.
but
if--
mr.
chad
a.
readler
--we
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chad
a.
readler
i
don't
think
it's
one
you
can
cast
aside.
i
think
you
--
you
have
to
give
this
more
development.
and
by
the
way,
he
was
proceeding
pro
se.
i
think
when
he
--
when
the
case
is
remanded,
with
assistance
of
counsel,
he
can
present
--
better
present
the
evidence
and
better
present
some
other
things
to
make
the
showing
stronger.
and
i
think
we
can
meet
the
schlup
standard.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'd
ask
that
the
sixth
circuit
be
affirmed.
