justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bursch,
i
thought
that
--
that
perkins
--
didn't
he
say
that
--
that
you
could
take
into
account
--
i'm
looking
for
the
brief
--
you
could
take
into
account
delay
as
a
factor
in
whether
his
actual-innocence
gateway
plea
should
be
heard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
did
--
what
would
it
take
to
--
what
would
it
take
to
show
diligence?
and
didn't
he
say
that
he
tried
to
get
a
lawyer
several
times
and
was
unsuccessful?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
--
was
that
argued
to
the
--
to
the
sixth
circuit?
did
you
argue
in
the
sixth
circuit
that,
even
assuming
diligence,
it
wasn't
enough
here,
and
that's
what
the
district
court
held?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
it
was
explicitly
made
to
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
present
the
argument--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
are
saying
that
congress
overruled
schlup;
is
that
what
--
the
point
you're
making?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
can't
you
cross-examine
her?
is
it
just
because
the
lapse
of
time
and
she
won't
remember?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
proceed
with
that,
can
you
address
justice
alito's
point
that
the
district
court
said
there
is
no
merit
to
this;
it's
not
an
actual
innocence
--
it's
not
a
valid
actual
innocence
claim.
and
then
the
sixth
circuit
sends
it
back
for
the
district
court
to
decide
something
it's
already
decided?
how
do
you
overcome
that
the
sixth
circuit
never
reviewed
the
actual
innocence
question,
the
district
court
did
and
said
it
doesn't
make
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
statute
of
limitations
would
run
from
the
discovery
of
the
new
evidence,
not
from--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
have
a
larger
--
you
have
a
larger
category,
you
say
miscarriage
of
justice.
so
one
is
actual
innocence.
you
say
the
category
is
well
defined.
so
what
else
would
fit
under
this?
and
we
can
bring
it
up
very
late
in
the
day.
anything
else
other
than
actual
innocence
would
be
in
this
category?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
the
second
circuit,
where
they've
had
a
similar
case,
the
second
circuit
itself
said
that
actual
innocence
is
rare.
this
is
such
a
case.
this
is
a
case
where
the
alibi
that
he
had
was
--
it
was
established
by
forensic
evidence,
air-tight,
he
was
someplace
else.
the
--
the
second
circuit
didn't
send
it
to
the
district
court
to
decide
the
actual
innocence.
it
decided
that
itself
and
then
said:
district
court,
now
you
deal
with
the
--
with
the
questions
that
the
petitioner
is
raising,
the
constitutional
questions.
but
the
sixth
circuit
just
seemed
to
be
--
it
didn't
matter
whether
--
it
didn't
matter
whether
the
actual
innocence
claim
had
any
solid
basis
when
they
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court.
so,
shouldn't
--
if
there
is
an
actual-innocence
gateway,
shouldn't
the
court
of
appeals
determine
that
before
it
returns
the
case
to
the
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
didn't
find
anything
about
whether
this
was
--
this
claim
was
a
good
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i'm
still
puzzled
about
what
happens
next.
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
--
the
district
court
is
told:
diligence
doesn't
matter.
the
district
court
says,
yes,
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
the
claim
was
worthless.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
involves
what
we
have
called
a
gateway
for
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petitioner
to
gain
adjudication
of
an
alleged
constitutional
error.
an
edifying,
i
hope,
illustration.
suppose
a
person
asserts
that
at
his
trial,
he
was
denied
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
but
there
is
a
procedural
impediment
to
making
that
claim.
for
example,
the
prisoner
failed
to
raise
it
in
an
earlier
petition.
if
the
prisoner
can
show
that
he
is
actually
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
has
been
convicted,
that
showing
will
serve
as
a
gateway
enabling
him
to
present
the
otherwise
barred
claim
of
constitutional
error.
in
1993,
floyd
perkins
was
charged
with
murdering
his
friend,
rodney
henderson.
at
trial,
perkins'
principal
defense
was
that
the
prosecution's
key
witness,
damarr
jones,
committed
the
murder
while
perkins
himself
took
no
part
in
it.
a
michigan
jury
convicted
perkins
and
his
conviction
became
final
in
may
1997.
under
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996,
aedpa,
a
state
prisoner
has
one
year
from
the
date
on
which
his
conviction
became
final
to
petition
for
habeas
corpus
relief
in
federal
court.
if
the
petition
is
based
on
new
evidence,
the
prisoner
must
file
within
one
year
of
the
date
on
which
the
new
evidence
could
have
been
discovered
had
the
prisoner
acted
diligently.
perkins
first
petitioned
for
federal
habeas
relief
in
june
2008,
more
than
11
years
after
his
conviction
became
final.
he
asserted
that
his
delay
should
not
bar
relief
because
he
is
in
fact
innocent
of
henderson's
murder.
in
support
of
his
innocence
claim,
perkins
submitted
three
affidavits,
each
pointing
to
jones
as
the
killer.
the
district
court
dismissed
his
petition
as
untimely.
in
the
alternative,
the
district
court
ruled
that
perkins
did
not
meet
the
strict
standard
by
which
pleas
of
actual
innocence
are
measured.
on
appeal,
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
if
perkins
could
show
actual
innocence,
his
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
should
be
treated
as
if
it
had
been
filed
on
time.
we
granted
review
to
resolve
a
circuit
conflict
on
this
question.
“can
aedpas
statute
of
limitations
be
overcome
by
a
convincing
showing
of
actual
innocence?”
our
answer
is
a
qualified
yes.
this
court
has
several
times
ruled
that
a
convincing
claim
of
actual
innocence
may
supercede
a
threshold
barrier
to
relief.
this
departure
from
strict
application
of
procedural
requirements
has
been
called
“the
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
exception”.
the
exception
survived
aedpas
passage,
we
have
held,
and
in
equity
we
hold
today,
it
can
apply
to
aedpas
time
limitations.
we
part
ways
with
the
sixth
circuit
in
one
respect.
that
court
indicated
incorrectly
in
our
judgment
that
a
prisoner's
failure
to
exercise
diligence
is
immaterial
to
the
miscarriage
of
justice
exception.
unjustifiable
delay
on
the
petitioner's
part,
although
not
an
absolute
barrier
to
relief,
thus,
bear
on
the
determination
where
the
innocence
has
been
reliably
shown.
taking
account
of
an
unexplained
delay
in
this
way
in
judging
the
merits
of
the
actual
innocence
claim
avoids
unfairness
to
the
state
whose
witnesses
may
have
become
unavailable
or
may
lack
a
clear
memory
of
what
transpired.
at
the
same
time,
the
evaluation
we
instruct
reduces
the
risk
that
innocent
persons
will
linger
in
prison
as
a
result
of
constitutional
errors
in
their
prosecutions.
successful
actual-innocence
gateway
claims,
we
caution,
are
rare
as
the
standard
for
relief
is
demanding.
the
gateway
should
open
only
when
in
light
of
all
the
evidence,
old
and
new,
no
reasonable
juror
would
have
found
the
petitioner
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we
return
the
case
for
the
six
circuit's
determination
whether
perkins'
claim
fits
that
bill.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
in
fold
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
and
in
principle
part
by
justice
alito.
