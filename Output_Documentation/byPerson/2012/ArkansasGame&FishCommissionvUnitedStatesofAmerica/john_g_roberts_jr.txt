chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
no.
11-597,
arkansas
game
&
fish
commission
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
goodhart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
i
don't
--
why
is
that
every
flood?
you
go
through
your
three
factors,
you
could
have
lots
of
flood
that
aren't
a
substantial
intrusion.
you
know,
you
get
an
extra
inch
of
water,
and
then
it
recedes.
and
it's
--
you
know--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
get
a
note
from
the
corps
of
engineers
saying,
we're
sorry,
it
won't
happen
again.
that's
not
--
every
flood
is
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
--
there
is
a
little
confusion
about
the
government's
position,
there
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
is
it
--
i'm
quoting
from
your
friend's
brief,
and
he
says:
"the
federal
circuit
adopted
a
categorical
rule
that
temporary
government
action
can
never
be
a
taking
if
the
government
does
not
intend
to
create
a
permanent
flooding
condition.
"
is
that
an
accurate
statement
of
your
understanding?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
are
pretty
clear
findings
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
question
of
causation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
so
if
the
government
comes
in
and
tells
a
landowner
downstream
that
every
march
and
april
we
are
going
to
flood
your
property
so
that
you
can't
use
it,
from
now
on,
that's
the
way
--
that's
part
of
our
plan,
that's
a
taking
for
those
2
months,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no?
the
government
says
you
will
not
be
able
to
use
your
land
because
of
what
we
are
doing
for
2
months
--
you
have
been
able
to
up
to
now,
but
from
now
on,
for
march
and
april,
you
can't.
that's
not
a
taking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'll
grant
you
that
it
can
decide
whose
land
it
wants
to
take.
i
just
want
to
know
why
that's
not
a
taking.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
the
government
says
we've
got
to
release
the
flood
waters
and
what
we're
going
to
do
is
we're
going
to
have
water
trucks
pull
up
behind
the
dam,
we're
going
to
load
them
up
and
we're
going
to
drive
them
downriver
to
this
person's
property
and
we're
going
to
dump
the
water
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
answer
is
that
would
be
a
taking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
again,
i
think
the
court
of
claims'
findings
are
to
the
contrary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
said
the
government
knew
that
this
water
was
going
to
go
right
here,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
government
decides
for
purposes
of
flood
control
--
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
the
ecological
way
--
but
the
water
has
to
percolate
or
whatever
down
in
this
area.
so
it
goes
onto
this
person's
land
and
it
cuts
down
$5
million
worth
of
his
trees.
the
same
purpose,
to
assist
in
flood
control.
no
doubt
that
that's
a
taking,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure,
sure.
and
so
the
government
then
comes
down
and
says,
we're
going
to
flood
your
land
and
we
know
--
again,
looking
at
the
factual
findings
--
we
know
that
will
result
in
your
trees
dying,
but
because
we're
doing
it
for
flood
control,
that's
just
too
bad.
different
case
when
they
go
in
with
a
chain
saw
than
when
they
go
in
with
the
water?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
before
you
get
off,
because
i
think
part
of
the
confusion,
at
least
for
me,
is
the
difference
between
what
the
federal
circuit
decided
and
what
you're
arguing.
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
it's
not
--
whether
it's
temporary
or
permanent,
right?
the
federal
circuit
thought
it
was
dispositive
that
this
they
viewed
as
temporary
and
not
permanent.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
fighting,
and
you're
fighting
a
lot
of
the
court
of
claims'
very
exhaustive
findings,
to
present
a
different
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
disagree,
and
we
think
it
makes
a
difference
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
50
years,
but
it
might
be
something
less,
then
maybe
you've
preserved
all
these
other
arguments
or
maybe
not,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
know,
but
you
agree
--
you
agree
with
the
federal
circuit,
but
then
you're
presenting
all
these
other
arguments
in
which
it
doesn't
depend.
so,
if
we
disagree
with
the
federal
circuit,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
say
that,
and
maybe
you
can
make
these
other
arguments
about
it's
too
far
downstream
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--or
upstream,
under
your
theory.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
strikes
me
that
that's
a
valuation
question.
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
there
was
a
pipe
coming
out
of
the
dam
and
it
went
to
somebody's
--
right
to
the
property
line
of
somebody's
land
and
that's
where
you
dump
the
water,
that
would
be
a
taking.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
i
thought
the
factual
findings
in
the
trial
court
said
that
was
this
case,
that
you
knew
when
you
opened
up
the
dam
that
this
is
where
the
water
was
going
to
go.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
6
years
later,
when
it
was
doing
the
same
thing
and
the
water
went
to
the
same
place?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
there's
notice
and
comment
--
so
the
choice
is,
there
are
10
landowners
downstream.
the
question
is
which
one
you're
going
to
flood.
and
you
flood
number
2,
and
there
is
a
public
process
in
which
number
1
and
3
through
10
get
to
say,
yeah,
this
sounds
fine
to
me.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
goodhart,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-597,
arkansas
game
and
fish
commission
versus
the
united
states.
