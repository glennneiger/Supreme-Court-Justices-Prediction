justice
antonin
scalia
was
sanguinetti
--
had
we
had
any
temporary
takings
cases
before
sanguinetti?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
was
sanguinetti
expressing
a
special
rule
for
flooding,
or
was
it
--
was
it
simply
saying
there
can't
be
a
temporary
taking?
if
the
latter,
that
dictum
if
it's
dictum
or
a
holding
if
it
was
a
holding
has
already
been
overruled
by
our
later
temporary
takings
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
cases
about
flying
over
land--
justice
antonin
scalia
--cases
about
shooting
--
shooting
over
lands.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
water,
but
it
ain't
taking,
either,
in
the
--
in
the
narrow
sense
that
justice
breyer
has
talked
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
hadn't
harmed
the
timber?
i
mean,
you
know,
the
damages
claimed
are
a
lot
--
a
lot
of
the
timber
that
would
have
been
valuable
was
--
was
impaired
by
these
floodings.
suppose
that
did
no
harm
at
all?
suppose
it
had
just
been
for
a
certain
period
of
time
you
were
not
able
to
use
that
land
for
anything?
you
couldn't
plant
anything
on
it.
you
couldn't
picnic
on
it.
you
couldn't
do
anything.
would
that
have
been
--
nonetheless,
despite
the
fact
that
there
--
there
was
no
harm
done
except
--
except
the
flooding
--
would
that
have
been
a
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
has.
it's
flooded.
he
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
does.
he
can't
plow
on
it.
he
can't
picnic
on
it.
how
does
that
not
interfere
with
his--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it
would
be
a
taking.
are
you
saying
yes
or
no?
what
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
our
cases
--
our
cases
treat
physical
occupations
differently
from
other
--
from
other
cases,
don't
they?
the
park
ranger
walking
through
can
hardly
be
called
a
physical
occupation.
he's
on
the
land,
but
it's
not
a
physical
occupation.
what
you're
--
what
you're
arguing
here
is
that
--
is
that
flooding
the
land
is
a
physical
occupation
for
the
period
that
it's
flooded.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
what
you
say
--
here's
what
troubles
me.
you
say
it
has
to
be
substantial.
but
you
--
can
we
--
can
we
fold
into
that
word
substantial
a
requirement
that
it
have
caused
substantial
financial
loss?
see,
if
that
were
the
case,
then
--
then
i
could
distinguish
your
case
where
a
lot
of
valuable
trees
got
destroyed.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
wouldn't
say
every
--
you
know,
every
flood
that
goes
across
a
land,
even
two
years
or
three
years
in
a
row,
would
not
necessarily
be
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
kansas
city
case
that
you
are
referring
to?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
are
you
saying
that
if
this
landowner
owned
land
behind
the
dam
that
was
temporarily
flooded
as
often
as
has
happened
here,
that
that
would
be
a
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
didn't
think
you
were
saying
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
foreseeable
and
certain
incidental
consequence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
not
necessarily.
suppose
there
--
because
of
a
spring
melt-off
or
other
factors,
it's
clear
that
the
reservoir
for
several
months
of
the
year
will
be
more
extensive
than
it
will
the
rest
of
the
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
could
say,
just
--
just
as
here,
that
there's
only
been
a
temporary
taking
of
some
of
the
land
behind
the
reservoir.
now,
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
government
condemn
all
the
land--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
that
which
would
be
only
temporarily
flooded?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
that
can't
overrule
the
takings
clause,
can
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
nice
that
congress
doesn't
want
to
be
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
issue
is
who
is
going
to
pay
for
the
wonderful
benefit
to
these
farmers.
should
it
be
everybody,
so
that
the
government
pays,
and
all
of
us
pay
through
taxes,
or
should
it
be
this
--
this
particular
sorry
landowner
who
happens
to
lose
all
his
trees?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
particularly
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
--
one
of
those
risks
has
to
be
the
government's
going
to
make
you
pay
for
protecting
somebody
else.
is
that
one
of
the
risks?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
doubt
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
flooding
that
time
of
year.
that's
the
problem.
i
mean
--
yes,
flooding
at
a
time
when
it
wouldn't
harm
the
trees.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
would
say
that
even
--
even
if
this
land
was
permanently
flooded,
okay,
permanently
flooded
so
he
couldn't
use
it
at
all,
since
it
was
downstream,
no
harm
done,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
he
loses
because
the
corps
comes
in
and
says,
yeah,
indeed,
we
did
flood
2,
but,
in
order
to
save,
you
know,
1
and
3
through
10.
right?
and
--
and
he'd
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
it's
not
arbitrary.
