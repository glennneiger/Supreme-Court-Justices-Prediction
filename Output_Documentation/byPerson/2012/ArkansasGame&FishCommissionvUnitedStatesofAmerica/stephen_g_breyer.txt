justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
ones?
because
i
counted
eleven
cases
which
either
say,
state,
some
seem
to
hold
or
support
the
proposition
that
when
it's
temporary
with
a
flood
it's
a
trespass,
and
where
it's
permanent
it's
a
taking.
okay?
i
mean,
i
have
eleven.
and
so
i've
got
from
my
law
clerk.
and
then
i
tried
to
see,
well,
what
are
the
ones
that
say
the
opposite?
and
so
far
we've
come
up
with
zero.
all
right?
you
could
argue
that
there
were
three
cases
during
the
war
which
might
be
read
that
way,
though
they
don't
quite
mention
it.
so
which
of
the
cases
that
you
--
rather
than
list
my
eleven,
i'm
more
interested
in
what
you
think,
and
so
i'd
like
to
know
which
are
the
ones
you
think
support
--
with
something
like
a
flood,
which
it's
not
--
you're
not
physically
taking
hold
of
the
whole
thing.
you're
sending
something
in
that
comes
back.
which
of
the
ones
support
you
that
temporary
is
not
a
trespass,
temporary
is
a
taking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
dickinson
--
i
got
written
down
dickinson.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
kimball
laundry.
kimball
laundry
was
the
laundry
facilities.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
took
the
laundry
facilities
for
3
years,
but
there
what
they
did
is
they
went
in
and
they
took
this
building,
you
know,
took
the
whole
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
with
a
flood
is
you
don't
take
all
the
land.
you
send
some
stuff
in.
and
the
stuff
is
there
for
a
while,
and
then
it
comes
back,
and
--
it's
called
water.
and
so
i
don't
know
what
to
make
of
the
cases
like
kimball
laundry
where
you
actually
appropriate
the
property.
i
suspect
that
they
are
not
quite
the
same.
anything
else?
i
got
dickinson;
i've
got
kimball
laundry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
causby.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
in
causby,
what
they
did
--
there
was
a
question
about
whether
just
flying
some
airplanes
over
is
a
taking
or
a
trespass.
but
it
went
on
for
25
years,
soit
was
a
long
time.
and,
therefore,
the
permanency
of
it
i
don't
think
is
at
issue
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
do
you
suggest
--
what
do
you
suggest
--
i
looked
at
the
consent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
tell
you
the
truth,
i
think
it's
permanent.
i
think
they're
thinking
it's
intermittent,
but
permanently
intermittent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
flood
comes
like
three
months
a
year
every
year.
and
the
erosion,
they
say
that
part
that's
eroded
belongs
to
the
government
now.
and
if
he
comes
back
with
his
dirt
and
puts
it
in,
that's
fine,
but
he's
trespassing
on
government
land.
so
if
i'm
right
in
reading
that,
if
i'm
right
--
and
a
big
if
--
it
seems
that
eleven
cases
somewhat
stand
for
this,
i
agree,
somewhat
arbitrary
rule.
now
--
so
i'm
tempted,
if
i'm
right,
to
say,
okay,
it's
not
perfect,
but
let's
go
with
it.
there
are
people
all
over
the
country
who
have
probably
relied
on
this
stuff.
and
that
would
be
so
absent
a
better
rule.
so
what
do
you
suggest
would
be
a
better,
clearer
rule
for
compensating
for
flooding
where
our
problem
is
what's
a
trespass
and
what's
a
taking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
know,
but
i
want
to
know
what
your
idea
--
i
understand
the
difficulties
are
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
i'm
willing
to
accept
a
lot
you
mentioned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
i'm
asking
--
which
i
just
did
ask
--
is
what's
your
idea
of
a
substitute
that
would
be
better?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
a
department
of
the
interior
employee
trespasses
on
jones's
land,
trampling
paths,
and
even
limbs
fall
off
trees.
that's
a
taking
and
not
a
trespass?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
our
department
employee
trying
to
find
a
shortcut
drives
his
bulldozer
through
jones's
land
knocking
down
his
favorite
redwood,
it's
a
taking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
legal
rubric?
i
mean
what
you're
--
what
i
haven't
thought
of
until
you've
been
putting
it
this
way
is
that
the
government
builds
a
dam.
when
it
does
it,
water
backs
up
behind
the
dam,
and
that
water
might
flood
somebody's
land.
that's
a
taking,
if
it's
at
least
permanent,
and
so
forth.
okay.
now,
the
government
builds
a
dam,
all
that
happens.
because
the
government
builds
a
dam,
a
lot
of
other
things
happen.
they
release
water
sometimes.
they
make
electricity
sometimes.
different
animals
come
in.
all
kinds
of
things
can
happen
to
different
people
200
yards
down.
some
will
be
200
miles
down,
200
--
you
know.
some
will
be
helpful,
some
will
be
hurtful.
can
they
never
bring
a
lawsuit?
can
they
sometimes
recover?
how
do
we
look
at
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
suppose
what
the
government
said
is,
mr.
smith,
you
live
150
miles
from
here,
and
we
have
a
rule,
and
our
rule
is
you
can't
cut
down
any
of
your
trees,
and
you
can't
farm
the
land,
and
you
can't
even
walk
on
it
without
a
boat.
all
right,
that
would
be
at
least
a
regulatory
taking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
--
now,
they're
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
here,
but,
instead
of
a
regulation,
they
send
some
water
in
to
do
it.
so
should
we
analyze
it
as
a
regulatory
taking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
that's
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
building
a
government
project,
let's
say
an
electricity
plant
or
high
tension
wires,
you
could
require
the
taking
of
some
land
to
build
it.
now,
you've
got
that
and
you
begin
to
run
it.
you
could
run
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
takes
some
of
the
property.
i
mean,
the
electricity
could,
for
example,
because
of
some
odd
thing
run
around
over
somebody's
land
and
kill
all
the
chickens.
that
wasn't
expected
but
it
happens,
and
it
happened
because
of
the
way
the
government
runs
the
plant.
now,
i
guess
there
would
be
a
taking
in
such
circumstance
if
in
fact,
because
of
the
way
it's
run,
it
makes
that
land
which
no
one
thought
would
happen,
as
a
consequence
of
the
project
uninhabitable;
wouldn't
there
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
collateral
consequence
is
to
make
some
piece
of
land
4
miles
away
quite
unexpectedly
but
totally
uninhabitable.
now,
what's
supposed
to
happen
there?
that's
not
just
a
trespass
because
it's
permanent.
and
even
if
it's
once
every
2
years,
it's
permanently
once
every
2
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
they
made
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
--
well,
that's
the
part
--
that's
the
point.
the
reason
they
don't
compensate
there
is
it
apparently
had
something
to
do
with
everybody
suffering
the
cinders.
but
where
the
cinders
went
out
of
the
train
and
they
ended
up
on
just
one
person's
property
because
there
were
some
pipes
or
something,
then
it
was
a
taking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here
they're
focusing
it
on
his
land.
