alito,

should
the
baseline
be
what
would
have
happened
if
the
dam
was
never
built?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
saying
there's
a
difference
between
the
situation
where
the
government
particularly
wants
the
water
to
go
to
a
--
to
a
place,
and
the
situation
where
the
government
knows
that's
where
it's
going
to
go
but
doesn't
particularly
care
where
it's
going
to
go?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
should
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
court
had
--
the
corps
has
a
plan
which
says,
we're
going
to
release
this
water
every
summer,
and
a
situation
where,
year
after
year
after
year,
somebody
makes
an
ad
hoc
decision
in
the
summer
that
we're
going
to
release
the
water?
