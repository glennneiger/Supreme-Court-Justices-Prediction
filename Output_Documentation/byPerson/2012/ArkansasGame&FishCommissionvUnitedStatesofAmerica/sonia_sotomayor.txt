justice

counsel,
all
of
our
cases
in
this
temporary
versus
permanent,
as
i
read
the
cases
and
i
read
what
the
multiple
facts
that
each
are
relying
on,
it
seems
to
me
that
our
cases
have
been
attempting,
in
the
term
“
temporary
”,
to
encompass
a
lot
of
different
concepts.
both
intentionality,
because
an
accidental
issue
is
not
a
taking;
causation:
did
this
--
and
that's
part
of
sanguinetti's
holding
--
did
what
the
government
do
actually
and
directly
cause
the
injury
at
issue?
and
foreseeability:
is
what
you
intended
something
whose
consequences
you
could
have
seen?
and
they
are
using
that
in
a
multifaceted
test,
one
that
the
solicitor
general
is
not
trying
to
endorse
here,
but
one
that
i
think
is
more
consistent
with
our
general
jurisprudence
in
this
area.
so
there
is
never
a
simple
answer
on
the
question
of
permanent
damage,
because
you
can
have
permanent
damage
that's
not
a
taking
if
all
of
the
other
factors
i've
just
mentioned
are
not
in
your
favor.
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
the
problem
with
this
case,
and
it's
part
of
what's
interwoven
in
your
adversary's
arguments,
is
that
with
flooding
it's
going
to
occur
naturally
anyway.
the
government
generally
builds
dams
to
control
that
flooding
to
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
interests
along
its
affected
route.
and
at
some
point,
either
the
government
is
going
to
--
is
going
to
make
a
decision
that's
going
to
help
someone
and
potentially
hurt
someone.
and
the
question
is,
is
in
all
of
those
situations
going
to
be
subject
to
litigation.
the
government's
rule
--
i
call
it
the
government's
rule,
but
it's
--
is
basically
simple.
it
can't.
because,
if
the
deviation
is
temporary
--
and
that's
what
the
circuit
below
said
--
it's
just
exercise.
it's
either
a
nuisance
or
temporary
trespass,
and
we're
not
going
to
hold
the
government
responsible
for
that
loss.
assuming
it's
going
to
occur
in
part
because
flooding
is
always
going
to
occur,
the
question
is
perhaps
when.
but
in
any
place
you
have
a
dam,
it's
there
because
flooding
was
happening.
isn't
that
the
basic
argument?
and
i
don't
know
that
you've
actually
announced
the
rule
that
addresses
the
essence
of
the
policy
considerations
that
are
driving
the
government
decision.
so
tell
me
how
your
rule
makes
this
a
manageable
situation.

but
that's
every
flood.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
every
flood.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
totally
confused
now.
is
dickinson
decided
wrong
under
your
theory?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
built
a
dam.
it
raised
the
water
level
and
flooded
the
petitioner's
land,
and
the
court
gave
recompense.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
just
said
two
minutes
ago
--
or
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
--
that
when
the
government
builds
a
dam,
even
if
it
floods
some
people
and
not
others,
that
there's
no
taking.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
after
it's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
the
baseline
--
tell
me
what
the
baseline
is.
and
perhaps
you
can
answer
justice
kennedy's
question
more
directly.
anything
in
the
reservoir
is
a
taking.
anything
downstream
is
never
a
taking.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
must
be
--
i
must
be
slow
today
because
i'm
--
i'm
having
significant
problem
with
your
articulation
of
your
test.
basically,
you're
saying
once
a
dam
is
built
--
once
a
dam
is
built,
no
downstream
owner
has
a
claim;
or,
you're
building
an
exception
from
when
the
claim
can
be
applied
to
a
downstream
owner?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
permanent,
reoccurring--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--foreseeable
or
anything
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
difference
does
that
make?
it's
nice
that
you
try
to
reach
consensus.
if
number
2
is
not
going
to
be
part
of
the
consensus
because
he's
the
one
always
affected--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you're
saying
permanency
--
permanency,
repetition,
nothing
counts,
he's
just
--
loses.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
the
baseline
--
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
--
is
it
before
the
dam
or
after
the
dam,
and
why
is
it
one
or
the
other?
if
flooding
was
going
to
occur
more
unpredictably
before
the
dam,
and
possibly
summer
flooding
of
this
kind
could
have
happened,
do
you
lose?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
though
after
the
dam
and
the
dam's
plan
was
to
ensure
that
it
didn't
happen,
you
would
still
lose?
if
natural
conditions--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
have
possibly
caused
this,
you
would
lose?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
pre-dam.
in
the
recorded
history.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
that's
not
open
to
dispute.
there
is
some
argument
here
that
rainfall
that
was
naturally
occurring
contributed
to
what
was
happening
to
the
trees.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
that
there
is
--
at
least
that's
what
i
understood
some
of
the
factual
argument
to
be.
