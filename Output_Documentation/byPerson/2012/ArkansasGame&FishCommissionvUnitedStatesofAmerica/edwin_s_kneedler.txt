mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
has
been
pointed
out,
this
court
has
consistently
held
in
its
flooding
cases
and
reaffirmed
in
loretto
that
a
taking
occurs
in
the
context
of
flooding
only
if
the
flooding
is
the
direct
result
of
the
structure
itself
and
if
it
results
in
a
permanent
effect
on
the
property
such
that
it's
an
actual
appropriation.
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
the
intent
point,
i
guess
i
would
modify
that.
there
are
some
things
that
--
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
an
objective
standard.
in
dickinson,
for
example,
the
modification
was
intrinsically
permanent.
the
landowner
had
corrected
for
it.
but
it
was
intrinsically
permanent
until
the
landowner
had
done
something
about
it.
so
actually
dickinson
is
consistent
with
our
--
with
our
position.
but
i
do
want
--
there
is
a
critical
piece
about
this
case
that
justice
kennedy's
questions
have
touched
upon
that
i
think
it's
very
important
for
this
court
to
focus
upon.
this
case
is
not
about
flooding
by
the
project
itself.
the
reservoir
behind
the
dam,
the
easements,
the
flowing
easements
there,
the
spillway,
the
project
is
the
government
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
the
government
is
occupying
the
land
when
the
government
builds
the
project.
what
we
have
here
are
incidental
consequences
downstream
from
the
dam
as
a
result
of
the
flowage.
and
there
are
--
loretto,
when
it
is
summing
up
this
court's
flooding
cases,
makes
two
points.
one,
it
says
it
has
to
be
permanent,
not
temporary
invasion;
but
it
also
distinguishes
the
category
of
cases
in
which
there
is
conduct
outside
the
landowner's
property
that
has
consequential
damages
within
the
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
this
would
be
a
particularly
bad
or
problematic
context
for
the
court
to
depart
from
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
causation,
and
if
i
could
just
point
out
two
cases,
one
of
which
was
cited
in
loretto
in
its
summing
up
of
this
court's
flooding
cases
is
bedford.
bedford
was
a
situation
in
which
a
revetment,
as
counsel
pointed
out,
a
revetment
was
constructed
in
the
--
in
the
mississippi
river
to
protect
erosion
and
access
to
the
city
of
vicksburg.
it
was
--
it
was
clearly
shown
in
that
case
that
over
time,
over
a
period
of
6
years,
as
in
this
case,
downstream
by
6
miles
it
resulted
in
permanent
flooding
of
land
as
a
consequence
of
that.
but
what
the
court
said
is
that
is
consequential
injury
downstream;
it
is
not
occupation
by
the
government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i
don't
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't,
and
let
me
explain
why.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
corps
of
engineers
operating
a
dam
from
which
it
has
to
take
into
account
multiple
considerations.
in
this
case,
there
was
marina
operators,
there
were
farmers
along
the
river,
there
were
drainage
districts.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
this
is
a
classic
example
of
the
government
adjusting
benefits
and
burdens.
this
is
why
the
federal
government
was
invited
in
to
construct
these
projects
because
along
the
river
there
was
very
serious
flooding.
so
the
government
puts
in
a
dam
to
control
the
flooding,
it
has
to
release
the
flood
waters,
and
the
timing
of
the
release
of
the
flood
waters
is
something
that
you
have
to
take
into
account--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that's
a
different
situation
because
the
government
itself
is
actually
putting
the
water
--
i
think
that's
very
close
to
being
the
reservoir
behind
the
dam.
but
--
but
typically,
when
the
government
--
i
think
uniformly,
when
the
government
is
operating--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
because
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
specifically
deposited
on
that
landowner's
land.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
be
the
same
as
if
they
put
a
pipe
from
the
dam--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
that
person's
land.
but
that's
not
what's
happening
when
the
government's
operating
a
dam,
and
it's
operating
it
with
consequences
for
the
basin.
it's
not
aimed
at
any
particular
landowner.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
was
not
--
there
is
no
suggestion
that
it
was
targeted
at
this
land,
which
is
--
which
is
i
think
something
quite
different.
this
was
--
this
was
an
incidental
consequence
of
what
was
happening
downstream.
again,
in
the
bedford
case
you
had
permanent--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
don't
believe
foreseeable
is
enough.
it
was
--
it
could
have
been
--
it
could
have
been
foreseeable
in
bedford.
let
me
take
a
more
--
a
more
dramatic
example
that
i
think
illustrates
this
point.
this
court's
decision
in
sponenbarger
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
case
discusses
a
prior
holding
by
this
court
in
a
case
called
jackson,
which
was
a
situation
where
a
levee,
government
built
a
levee
on
one
side
of
the
river
which
had
the
effect
of
flooding
property
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
because
it
--
it
kept
it
from
going
to
this
side
and
channelled
it
into
the
river
and
it
caused
it
to
overflow
the
--
the
land
on
the
other
side,
and
the
court
said
that
is
not
a
taking.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--unless
there
was
some
emergency
justification.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
when
they
go
in
with
the
chain
saw
the
government
is
actually
going
on
the
property
and
the
government
is,
to
use
counsel's
term,
directly
cutting
down
the
trees.
i
think
it's
very
hard
to
explain
consequences
110
miles
downstream
as
being
direct.
it's
--
and
there
is
no
case
that
--
that
petitioner
has
pointed
to
with
that
sort
of
incidental
consequence--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think,
under
this
court's
takings
decisions,
and
specifically
those
dealing
with
effects
caused
by
something
outside
the
property,
i
think
it
is
basically
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
analyzed
as
a
regulatory
taking--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
has
certain
parallels
in
that
respect
in
the
sense
that
the
government
has
to
make
a
choice.
it's
constructed
the
dam,
and
its
releases
are
going
to
help
someone
and
hurt
someone.
it
can't
be
put
in
a
position
where
it's
going
to
have
to
pay
compensation
every
time
it
chooses
one
--
one
thing
or
another.
there's
another
point
i'd
like
to
make--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
talking
about
downstream,
not
the
--
not
the
reservoir.
and
after
it
goes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--after
it
goes
through--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
assuming
it's
permanent
in
the
reservoir,
which
it's
likely
to
be
when
the
government
is
constructing
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
but
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
that
--
that
is
covered
by
this
court's
decision
in
cress,
in
which
the
court
said
that
if
you
have
a
situation
where
property
is
permanently
liable
to
inevitably
recurring
flooding,
that
that's
the
same
thing
as
a
permanent
--
even
though
sometimes
it's
not
--
it's
not
covered,
it
is
permanently
liable.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
insofar
as
we're
looking
at
the
temporary
aspect
of
it.
it
wasn't
seven
years,
it
was
--
it
was
--
it
was
a
series
of
individual
determinations
made
by
the
corps;
but
--
but
for
reasons
that
tie
into
the
downstream
effects,
it
was
releasing
water
from
the
dam
and
was
making
a
series
of
administrative
decisions
about
how
to
operate
the
dam.
it
has
a
water
control
manual.
downstream
landowners
are
protected,
not
by
retroactive
award
of
damages
under
the
just
compensation
clause,
but
by
public
participation
requirements--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
--
i
--
i
think,
under
this
court's
current
precedence,
there
would
be
no
claim
downstream.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
foreseeable.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
because
jackson,
spokenbarger
--
sponenbarger,
the
revetment
case,
bedford
were
all
cases
where--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--where
it
was
--
where
it
was
permanent.
if
i
could
mention
one
other
point--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
i
think
it's
--
we
have
argued,
both
below
and
here,
that
--
that
this
is
consequential,
and
that
--
that
it's
downstream
and
had
those
effects.
we
agree
with
the
--
with
the
federal
circuit,
we
are
not
disagreeing
with
that
conclusion,
because
this
is
--
these
were
temporary
--
a
series
of
individual
temporary
decisions
made
for
their
own
reasons.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
--
but
i
think,
in
deciding
what's
temporary,
you
shouldn't
divorce
it
from
context.
and
--
and
here,
the
context
is
the
consequences
downstream.
this
is
--
this
is
not
--
if
you
were
to
depart
from
the
court's
rule
up
until
this
point
about
permanence
--
and
there
has
to
be
--
something
less
than
permanent
will
do,
i
don't
think
you
should
ignore
the
fact
that
the
consequences
are
not
the
sort
of
direct
governmental
occupation
of
the
land
like
at
the
reservoir,
but
the
sort
of
consequences
downstream
that
affect
--
that
can
affect
a
whole
range
of
people.
and
i
would
like
to
make
one
very
important
point
about
context,
and
that
is,
in
1928,
after
the
great
mississippi
flood
of
1927,
congress
first
got
into
the
flood
control
business
in
a
massive
way,
but
it
--
it
--
it
was
unwilling
to
do
that
if
it
was
going
to
be
held
liable
for
consequential
damages
from
flood
waters
downstream.
it
therefore
included
section
702(c)
in
the
flood
control
act
of
1928,
which
says
that
the
government
shall
not
be
liable
for
any
damage
to
any
property
at
any
place
resulting
from
floods
or
flood
waters.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
what
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
congress
--
no,
it's
--
the
point
is
more
fundamental
than
that.
congress
recognized
--
and
the
legislative
history
shows
this
--
congress
recognized
that
under
this
court's
precedence,
there
would
not
be
takings
liability.
the
bedford
decision
is,
in
fact,
cited
in
that.
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
james
decision,
which
recounts
the
history
of
that,
that
there
was
a
proposal
to
--
to
make
the
government
responsible
under
the
flood
--
flood
control
projects
for
any
taking
or
any
damage
to
property.
and
this
court
said
that
went
way
beyond
anything
the
fifth
amendment
would
require,
and
it
was
cut
back.
and
congress
said
it's
not
going
to
be
liable
for
any
damage.
and
i
think
that
shows
a
very
important
reliance
interest
on
the
part
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
line
that
this
court
has
drawn.
congress
was
not
going
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't
believe
that
that's
correct.
i
mean,
that
--
that
would
turn
on
the
happenstance
of
what
a
particular
landowner
had
--
had
on
his
property
downstream.
and
i
think
the
government,
in
operating
the
general
project,
cannot
be
held
to
do
an
investigation
of
every
property
owner.
again,
it's
releasing
water
generally.
and
if
we
--
maybe
if
i
could
use
the
levy
example
here.
this
--
the
release
changes
that
were
made
here
were
made
to
protect
farmers
so
that
they
could
--
so
that
they
could
plant
more
crops
and
not
--
and
be
protected
during
their
harvesting.
if
you
shift
back
to
what
the
corps
--
to
the
corps'
regular
operating
scheme,
it
affects
the
farmers.
there
might
be
a
flood--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
in
the
nature--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is
in
the
nature
of
living
along
a
river.
riparian
ownership
carries
with
it
certain
risks
and
uncertainties,
from
weather,
from
intervening
causes.
the
government
is
--
there
are
a
thousand
square
miles,
more
square
miles
of
drainage
area--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
when
--
picking
up
on
what
i
said
about
congress,
congress
would
not
have
gotten
into
the
flood
control
business
without
this
protection
of
liability.
people--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
this
court
in
james
said
it
was
an
important
condition
for
congress
getting
into
it,
that
it
was
not
--
congress
was
not
going
to
be
held
liable
for
the
--
for
the
damages
downstream.
that
came
to
be
the
basis,
the
baseline,
of
expectations
for
people
downstream
from--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
it's
--
but
the
construction
of
the
project
itself
and
the
flooding
of
the
reservoir,
the
government
condemns
that
land,
purchases
that
land.
it
recognizes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
question
would
be
whether
it
falls
within
the
cress
test
of
whether
it
is
permanently
liable.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
--
it
was
basically
--
i
mean,
it
was
the
rationale
of
this
court's
cases
in
--
in
bedford,
in
sponenbarger,
and
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
loretto,
a
modern
takings
case
dealing
with
the
question
of
physical
occupation.
and
the
court
said
that
--
and
it
made
two
points.
again,
it
said
--
it
made
the
temporary
versus
permanent
point,
but
it
also
made
the
point
about
conduct
outside
the
land
that
has
an
effect
inside
the
land.
this
case
has
both
of
those
features.
you
have
a
series
of
temporary
decisions--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
again,
it
depends.
if
the
government
--
if
the
government
is
occupying
the
land
when
it
happens,
yes.
but
there's
--
as
you've
i
think
pointed
out,
there's
a
critical
difference
between
a
tort
and
a
taking.
and
there
--
there
can
be
collateral
consequences
of
what
the
government
does
that
--
that
cause
injury.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
--
and
there
was
a
--
a
case
--
i
believe
it's
the
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
says
if
the
--
it
had
to
do
with
releasing
smoke
from
--
from
a
train.
and
the
court
said
just
--
just
releasing
it
into
the
air--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
--
but
if
you
focus
it
on
someone--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
--
if
you
pipe
it
--
if
you
pipe
it
to
the
person's
property,
that's
a
--
that
may
be
a
different
matter.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
focused,
and
that's
not
--
not
true
in
the
operation
of
the
dam.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they're
not
focusing
it
on
his
land.
his
land
--
first
of
all,
the
commission's
land
has
always
been
subject
to
flooding
and,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
even
under
--
even
under
petitioner's
analysis,
it
results
in
an
incremental
flooding
of
5,
4
or
--
3
or
4
days.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
it
is
land
--
it
is
land
in
a
floodplain
that
would
be
suitable
for
any
sort
of
construction
or
development.
it
is
land
in
a
floodplain.
and
they
have
--
they
have
not
argued,
and
in
fact,
their
appraiser
in
this
case
acknowledged,
that
there
is
no
permanent
decrease
in
the
valuation
of
the
land.
they
are
--
they
are
arguing
only
about
trees.
and
that
is
--
that
seems
classic
consequential
tort-type
damages,
that
--
that
flood
waters,
we'll
assume
in
somewhat
greater
increments,
went
on
the
land
and
damaged
trees.
they
didn't
damage
the
land.
in
fact,
the
commission
--
there
was
still
hunting
on
the
land
during
this
period
of
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--first
of
all,
the
court
--
the
court
did
not
say
that
the
government
knew.
in
fact,
it
said
the
government
was
unaware
--
this
discussion's
between
95a
and
99a
in
the
court
of
federal
claims
decision
--
that
the
government
was
unaware
in
--
in
1993.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
taking
goes
--
the
taking
claim
here
goes
from
1993
to
1998.
the
court
of
federal
claims
said
even
as
of
19
--
at
least
until
1996,
it
was
generally
assumed
that
the
operations
of
the
dam
did
not
have
a
significant
impact
below
the
missouri-arkansas
line.
again,
this
is
110
miles
downstream.
this
was
in
no
way
focused
on
the
--
on
the
commission's
land,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
there's
a
--
i
don't
know
about
the
“
intend
”.
i
mean,
in
the
hypothetical
with
the
chief
justice
the
government
was
actually
transmitting
the
water.
it
was
essentially
using
the
land
as
--
as
a
reservoir.
and
that
--
that's,
i
think,
what
petitioner's
counsel
was
trying
to
conjure
up
by
saying
the
government
was
using
this
land
for
storage.
the
government
was
not
using
this
land
for
storage.
the
--
this
wasn't
the
government's
water.
there
weren't
any
outtakes
from
the
commission's
land
to
use
this
water.
these
were
flood
waters,
which
again
the
flood
control
act
says
the
government
is
not
liable
for
the
release
of
flood
waters
from
a
project,
that
ended
up
on
the
land
that
is
an
incidental
consequence
of
the
operation
of
a
flood
control
project.
people
who
live
in
a
basin
where
there
is
a
flood
control
project
get
enormous
benefits
in
the
control
of
that.
the
water
has
to
be
released.
and
it
has
long
been
the
case
that
the
way
that
problem
is
--
that
issue
is
handled
about
how
it
will
be
released
is
by
ordinary
administrative
law
principles,
basically,
with
the
corps,
in
operating
the
dam,
they
have
requirements
of
public
participation.
in
this
case,
the
commission
participated
on
ad
hoc
planning
groups.
this
manual
had
not
been
updated
in
50
years.
corps
regulations
say
that
manuals
should
be
updated
to
keep
apace
of
changing
circumstances,
population
changes,
different
uses,
environmental
concerns,
so
that
when
that
happens,
the
commission
acted
responsibly
here
and,
had--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that's
the
consequence
of
this
--
but
there's
no
--
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
--
that's
i
think
the
necessary
consequence
of
this
court's
holdings
in
bedford,
in
bedford
and
related
cases.
and
--
it
may
have
harshness
in
some
circumstances.
but
again,
when
you
live
on
a
river
and
you
know
the
consequences
of
having
a
flood
control
project
on
the
river,
that
--
that's
what
happens,
but
this
is
not
arbitrary.
there
is
this
planning
process.
there
is
notice
and
comment.
there's
nepa--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
happens.
what
the
corps
was
working
for
here,
it's
commendable.
the
corps
was
trying
to
develop
a
consensus
of
downstream
water
users,
which
is
why
it
convened
this
ad
hoc
working
group:
the
commission
drainage
districts,
representatives
of
farmers,
the
marina,
the
corps
of
engineers,
getting
everybody
together
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
--
with
a
way
to
handle
the
problem.
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
he
doesn't
lose
because
he
has
an
action
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
he's
not
--
the
--
the
corps
is
required
to
take
into
account
various
factors
including,
specifically,
the
impact
on
other
people
in
the
basin
when
it's
making
a
decision.
if
the
corps--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
corps
cannot
be
arbitrary
in
doing
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
--
but
the
corps
requires
a
broad
ambit
of
discretion
in
managing
a
river
over
time,
and
it
has
to
be
able
to
change
to
update
circumstances
without
exposing
the
united
states
to
massive
liability.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
have
two
submissions.
i
mean,
it's
the
confluence
of
both
factors
mentioned
in
loretto.
and
the
court
doesn't
have
to
decide
anything
broader
than
that.
it's
the
temporary
nature
of
the
decisions.
these
were
individual
decisions
made
often
with
a
recommendation
or
concurrence
of
the
ad
hoc
committee.
so
it's
temporary
in
nature
--
self
limiting,
as
everyone
knew
as
part
of
this
ongoing
planning
process
--
but,
also,
particularly
in
this
case,
where
it
has
only
consequential
effects
downstream,
which
is,
again,
the
way
the
court
--
including
in
lionel,
one
of
the
leading
cases
--
the
court
says
that
this
is
consequential.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
analytically,
for
the
reasons
i
said
about
--
about
the
downstream;
but,
to
the
extent
the
court
is
focusing
on
temporary,
these
were
self-limiting,
and
there
was
no
guarantee
they
were
going
to
be
renewed.
and,
in
fact,
at
the
end
of
this
process,
the
court
--
or
the
corps
decided
not
to
adopt
a
permanent
change
after
going
through
the
nepa
process.
