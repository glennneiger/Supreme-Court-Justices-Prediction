justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
what
we're
asking
you
is,
how
do
you
define
the
baseline
of
protected
expectations
for
the
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you've
indicated,
i
think,
in
your
brief
that
one
year
won't
do
it.
this
was
six
or
seven
years.
if
that's
a
baseline
of
expectations,
the
government
cannot
change
that,
even
if
it
thinks
that
there
is
a
higher
and
--
and
more
urgent
priority
in
protecting
some
other
land?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
question
is
how
do
you
define
the
baseline
that
gives
a
legitimate
expectation,
if
the
corps
of
engineers
--
did
not
happen
in
this
case,
but
in
the
hypothetical
case
--
makes
the
finding
that
there
is
a
more
urgent
and
--
and
a
higher
priority
for
other
lands,
and
it
changes
its
policy?
it
cannot
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
can't
make
that
change
without
paying,
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
suppose,
at
the
very
outset
of
the
dam,
the
government
says,
we've
got
to
put
this
water
someplace,
we're
going
to
put
it
on
the
left
bank,
not
the
right
bank.
that's
not
a
taking
as
of
that
time--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--if
the
land
was
always
flooded
anyway
on
the
right?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
i
want
is
the
definition
of
the
operable
baseline
that
we
can
use
in
order
to
define
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
taking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
what
do
we
say
to
the
circuit?
what
do
you
want
us
to
tell
the
circuit
to
do
on
remand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
only
difference
in
that
formulation
and
this
case
is
that
it
was
for
seven
years
and
not
permanent?
is
that
your--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
the
hypothetical
is,
suppose
it
doesn't.
suppose
that
there's
some
land
that's
up
--
that's
fairly
far
upstream
from
the
main
reservoir,
but
it's
flooded
once
every
other
year.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
--
but
your
position
seems
to
be
that
if
it's
downstream,
somehow
it's
not
the
government.
there's
a
series
of
administrative
actions
and
it's
not
really
the
government's
water.
it's
like
--
it's
like
the
old
moral
of
refuge
that
the
rocket
designers
take:
you
know,
i
make
the
rockets
go
up;
where
--
where
they
come
down
is
not
my
concern.
