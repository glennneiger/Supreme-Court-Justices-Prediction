justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
this
court's
precedent
in,
what
is
it,
the
sanguinetti
case,
where
the
court
said
that
for
there
to
be
government
responsibility
it
is
at
least
necessary
that
the
overflow
constitute
a
permanent
invasion
of
the
land
amounting
to
an
appropriation,
not
merely
an
injury,
to
property?
we
would
have
to
withdraw
or
modify
that
statement,
would
we
not,
if
you
--
if
your
--
your
argument
prevails?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
would
cover
a
one-time
flood.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
understand
that.
you
said
if
--
if
it's
one
flood,
even
though
it
destroys
the
trees,
and
certainly
would
not
make
--
would
make
it
impossible
to
have
picnics,
what
--
so
if
that's
your
position,
then
you're
turning
on
it
happened
six
times,
not
once.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
goodhart,
maybe
it
would
help
to
know
what
you
think
if
we
accept
your
position
would
be
left
over
for
the
federal
circuit
to
consider
on
remand.
you
haven't
asked
to
--
for
outright
reversal
and
have
the
decision
of
the
court
of
federal
claims
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
so
if
we
accept
your
position,
then
what
issues
would
be
open
for
the
federal
circuit
to
resolve
on
remand?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
were
the
other
issues
that
you
just
mentioned?
you
said
we
couldn't
ask
for
an
automatic
affirmance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
--
mr.
kneedler,
what
was
wrong
with
judge
newman's
position
on
this
temporary
versus
permanent?
it
says
that
she
said
that
temporary
versus
permanent,
the
target
should
not
be
the
government's
action,
but
the
effect
of
that
action;
that
is,
if
trees
are
killed
and
they
weren't
revived,
the
damage
is
permanent.
that's
where
we
should
vote,
not
whether
the
government
is
going
to
do
this
year
after
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
does
your
essential
argument
turn
on
this
being
indirect,
as
you
say?
this
is
consequential;
therefore,
it
isn't
--
it
doesn't
belong
in
the
takings
category,
anything
that's
consequential
rather
than
direct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
takings
clause
of
the
constitution,
which
instructs
that
private
property
shall
not
be
taken
for
public
use
without
just
compensation.
when
is
property
taken
for
public
use?
that
question
arises
in
the
case
we
today
resolve.
the
army
corps
of
engineer
operates
a
dam
on
the
black
river,
upstream
from
a
wildlife
management
area
owned
and
operated
by
the
arkansas
game
and
fish
commission.
the
management
area
comprises
23,000
acres
of
hardwood
forest.
between
1993
and
2000,
the
corps
operated
the
dam
in
a
manner
that
deviated
from
historical
practice.
the
corps
did
so
in
order
to
accommodate
the
interest
of
farmers.
the
arkansas
commission
alleged
that
these
deviations,
beneficial,
as
they
may
have
been
to
farmers,
lead
to
unprecedented
levels
of
flooding
on
its
forest
domain
over
a
six-year
period.
the
cumulative
effect
of
the
recurrent
flooding,
the
commission
stated,
damaged
or
destroyed
more
than
18
million
board
feet
of
timber
and
altered
the
character
of
the
terrain.
after
conducting
a
trial,
the
court
of
federal
claims
ruled
for
the
commission,
holding
that
the
corps'
actions
qualified
as
a
taking
of
property,
impermissible
without
just
compensation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
reversed.
as
a
rule,
the
appellate
court
noted,
government
actions
need
not
be
permanent
to
count
as
a
taking
of
property,
but
government
induced
flooding,
the
federal
circuit
held,
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
must
be
permanent
or
inevitably
recurring
to
rank
as
a
taking
of
property.
we
reversed
the
federal
circuit's
judgment.
government
induced
flooding,
we
hold,
even
when
finite
in
duration,
gains
no
automatic
exemption
from
takings
clause
inspection.
we
have
long
held
that
a
taking
may
occur
when
government
action
causes
flooding
of
real
property.
we
have
also
held
that
government
acquisition
or
invasion
of
property
can
be
a
taking,
even
when
temporary
in
nature.
these
settled
holdings
lead
us
to
conclude
a
government
induced
flooding
of
limited
duration
but
severe
impact
can
amount
to
a
taking
of
property,
warranting
just
compensation.
in
reaching
the
opposite
conclusion,
the
federal
circuit
relied
on
united
states
against
sanguinetti,
a
1924
decision
in
which
this
court
held
that
no
taking
occurred
when
a
government
constructed
canal
overflowed
onto
private
land.
language
in
the
court's
opinion
accounts
for
the
federal
circuit's
position.
but
the
dispositive
holding
in
sanguinetti,
was
simply
this,
“the
property
owner
failed
to
prove
that
the
government's
construction
of
the
canal
in
fact
caused
the
flooding.”
read
in
light
of
that
no-causation
holding,
sanguinetti
does
not
establish
the
temporary
flooding
under
any
and
all
circumstances
escapes
assessment
under
the
takings
clause.
removing
temporary
flooding
from
taking
clause
inspection
would
be
out
of
sync
with
our
recognition
that
as
a
rule,
temporary
takings
maybe
compensable.
why
should
courts
differentiate
flooding
from
the
myriad
other
instances
of
government
occupation
or
invasion
of
property?
given
no
persuasive
reason
to
treat
flooding
as
a
unique
category,
we
reject
the
temporary
flooding
exception
on
which
the
federal
circuit
grounded
its
decision.
we,
in
no
way,
suggest
that
all
floodings
caused
by
government
are
compensable.
courts
must
assess
the
relevant
facts
and
circumstances
in
each
case
to
determine
whether
what
the
government
has
done
amounts
to
a
taking.
as
our
decisions
in
this
area
of
counsel,
courts
should
consider
the
duration
of
the
interference,
whether
the
invasion
was
foreseeable
when
the
government
acted,
the
severity
of
the
interference,
and
the
degree
to
which
it
upsets
the
property
owner's
reasonable
expectations
regarding
the
lands
used.
the
federal
circuit
did
not
engage
in
these
case-specific
inquiries,
nor
did
it
consider
arguments
about
damage
to
downstream
property
or
the
relevance
of
state
law,
matters
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
and
therefore,
outside
our
review
province.
the
court's
opinion
remanding
the
case
to
the
federal
circuit
is
unanimous.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
