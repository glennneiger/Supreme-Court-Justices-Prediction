mr.
james
f.
goodhart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
is
whether
temporary
flooding
can
ever
constitute
a
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
federal
circuit
said,
no,
never,
ruling
that
the
permanent
consequences
of
the
government's
actions
were
not
relevant
solely
because
its
actions
were
not
permanent.
respectfully,
your
honors,
that
cannot
be
the
rule.
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
why.
first,
the
united
states
must
provide
just
compensation
when
its
direct
physical
invasion
substantially
intrudes
upon
a
landowner's
protected
property
interest,
regardless
of
the
particular
mode
or
duration
of
that
invasion.
and,
second,
the
federal
circuit's
decision
conflicts
with
fundamental
guarantees
that
the
takings
clause
is
intended
to
preserve,
and,
therefore,
is
manifestly
unjust.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
justice
ginsburg,
we
would
say
that
you
would
not
have
to
overrule
sanguinetti
because
the
language
there,
“
permanent
flooding
invasion
”,
was
--
was
not
how
the
case
turned
on
the
result.
the
court
there
did
make
an
inaccurate
summary
of
the
early
flood-taking
cases
--
pumpelly,
lynah,
and
kress.
none
of
those
cases
said
that
flooding
had
to
be
permanent.
the
facts
in
those
cases
did
have
a
permanent
condition
of
flooding,
but
that
was
not
made
a
requirement.
and
none
of
those
cases
said
that
you
could
not
have
temporary
flood
invasions.
but,
your
honor--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--justice
scalia--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--justice
scalia,
there
--
you're
correct.
there
was
no
temporary
takings
prior
to
sanguinetti.
the
court
there
didn't
have
occasion
to
address
temporary
flooding,
whether
that
could
constitute
a
taking.
and
all
of
the
cases
after
sanguinetti
that
have
actually
addressed
whether
a
direct
temporary
invasion
will
--
that
substantially
intrudes
upon
property
interests
have
held
that,
yes,
you
can
have
a
temporary--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--justice
breyer,
in
the
dickinson
case
in
1947
where
the
court
found
a
taking
from
flooding,
mr.
dickinson
reclaimed
his
property,
effectively
reclaimed
most
of
the
property
that
had
flooded,
effectively
ending
the
flood
invasion.
and
the
court
there
said
the
taking
was
a
taking
when
that
occurred,
regardless
of
whether
the
landowner
does
reclamation.
of
course,
this
court
in
the
war
seizure
cases,
in
general
motors,
petty
motor,
pewee
coal,
kimball
laundry,
in
all
of
those
cases
the
court
has
found--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
yes,
your
honor.
the
causby
case--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
united
states
flooded
the
air
over
the
causby's
residence
and
commercial
chicken
farm.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
yes.
your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
court
--
the
court
of
federal
claims
found
that
these
deviations
resulted,
in
over
8
years,
6
consecutive
years
of
recurring
flood
invasions
during
--
during
the
summertime,
during
unnatural
time
periods;
and
that
the
facts
were
more
compelling
than
even
in
causby
with
the
overflies
or
in
portsmouth
harbor
with
cannon
shots
flooding
the
air
over
portsmouth
landing
harbor
hotel.
this
--
these
flood
invasions
happened
each
year
for
specific
sustained
time
periods.
the
united
states
controlled
the
timing,
the
frequency,
and
the
extent
of
the
duration
of
these
floods.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
your
honor,
no.
if
--
there
would
not
have
been
a
taking
unless
the
landowner
could
show
substantial
intrusion
upon
his
protected
property
rights.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
if
--
your
honor,
if
he
can
show
that
the
--
he
has
the
right
to
exclude
superinduced
invasions
of
water,
that
--
so
it
doesn't
interfere
with
his
use
and
enjoyment.
here--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--well,
and
it
very
may
well,
your
honor.
and
here,
that
--
there
was
that--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--i'm
saying,
yes,
if
he
can
show
that
it
intruded
on
his
use
and
enjoyment,
and
as
you
said,
indicated,
that
type
of
interference,
yes.
it
would
be
a
--
it
would
be
a
substantial
intrusion
on
his
rights
to
use
his
property--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--not
necessarily,
justice
ginsburg.
a
one-time
flood
that
is
extensive,
it
could
kill
all
the
trees
on
this
management
area
in
one
flood.
however,
one
flood
may
not
result
in
substantial
intrusion
on
protected
property
rights.
so
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
facts,
your
honor,
in
the
case.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
and,
your
honor,
what
i'm
saying,
it's
a
proof
of
facts.
the
physical
takings
analysis
is
the
same.
the
legal
analysis
is
the
same.
but
one
flood
could
effectively
destroy
timber
if
it
is
a
lake;
if
it
sits
there.
we
didn't
have
that
in
our
case.
we
had
intrusion
during
1993
to
2000,
8
years,
6
of
which
were
substantially
throughout
the
summer
where
this
management
area
sat
in
water
during
june,
july,
into
august,
basically,
stagnated
water
that
choked
the
oxygen
from
the
roots
of
these
trees.
and
in
1999
it
was
termed
a
brownout.
it
was
massive.
once
the
timber
inventory
was
done,
it
revealed
that
there
was
over
100,000
trees
in
a
6,990-acre
area
that
were
either
destroyed
or
were
--
were
in
the
process
of
dying.
and
that
didn't
include
the
other
11,000
acres
that
we
subsequently
inventoried.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
yes,
your
honor,
you're
correct.
the
--
the
invasion
has
to
be
direct
by
the
united
states.
the
court
of
federal
claims
found
that
--
that
it
was
direct,
natural,
and
probable
--
the
results
were
--
from
the
government's
action.
one
thing
in
water
cases
is
you
don't
have
dye
in
the
water.
mr.
causby
could
look
up
and
see
the
insignia
on
the
airplanes.
and
we
knew
that
the
cannon
fire
from
the
--
from
the
artillery
was
coming
over
the
portsmouth
harbor's
land
was
from
the
government.
the
water,
you
can't
always
tell.
and
so
you
have
to
prove
that
that
was
directly
from
the
united
states.
and
the
commission
in
this
case
did.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
your
honor,
the
--
the
two
elements
of
the
rule,
that
there
must
be
direct
physical
invasion
by
the
united
states
and
not
from
some
other
cause,
and
there
must
be
substantial
intrusion
upon
these
protected
property
rights,
the
right
to
exclude,
the
right
to
use
and
enjoy,
and
the
right
to
dispose,
that--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--that
runs
throughout
this
court's--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
but
the
united
states,
when
it
does
its
flood
control--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--that's--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--not
--
you're
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
every
flood
is
certainly
not
rising
to
the
level
of
a
taking.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
your
honor--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--your
honor,
the
--
certainly,
the
government
is
not
the
insurer
of
--
of
flood
control,
how
they
just
carry
it
out.
there
is
the
case
that's
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
united
states
v.
sponenbarger,
which
says
that
very
thing.
the
united
states
is
not
the
insurer
of
it.
but
when
it
takes
water
and
it
controls
water
and
releases
it
in
a
manner
that's
not
from
storms,
not
from
natural,
but
does
it
in
a
manner
that
they
control
how
it's
released
and
the
duration,
frequency,
and
they
use
property
to
store
that
water
for
eight
--
you
know,
over
eight
years,
that
in
this
case
was
--
was
compelling.
and
the
court
found
that
those
facts--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--your
honor,
it
can
go
through
its
law,
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
the
clean
water
act.
it
can
make
changes,
and
then
it
can
pay
for
what
it's
going
to
take
from
private
landowners.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
it
--
it
cannot
make
that
change
where
it's
going
to
burden
the
landowner
and
interfere
with
that
--
those
property
rights
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
guaranteeing.
now,
it
can
practice--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--your
honor--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--that
may
not
be
a
taking.
and,
for
example,
in
the
bedford
case
in
1904,
where
a
revetment
was
in
the
mississippi
river,
it
was
trying
to
control
natural
erosion
from
a
cutoff
that
had
been
created,
the
landowner
could
not
show--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--and,
your
honor,
i
guess
i
must
say
it
may
not
be
a
bright
line.
it
is
--
the
analysis
here
that
this
court
has
used
throughout
its
physical
takings
cases
will
separate
the
torts
from
the
takings.
and,
here
again,
the
united
states
--
this
has
worked
well
in
other
cases
for
the
united
states,
where
in
sanguinetti
there
was
no--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--perhaps,
your
honor.
and
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
court
had
evidence
that
this
land
flourished
before
the
dam.
there
was
evidence
that
this
bottomland
hardwood
forest
existed
for
generations.
and
when
the
control
plan
was
put
in
effect
in
1953,
it
worked
fine
because
they
mimicked
natural
flow
where
late
--
late
winter
and
early
spring,
you
have
your
releases,
they
dissipate,
the
water
recedes,
but
you
don't
have
extensive
summertime
flooding
from
a
river.
frankly,
anywhere
in
the
country,
but
certainly
not
in
the
southern
part
of
the
united
states,
these
rivers
do
not
overflow
during
june,
july,
august.
this
never
happens.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
and,
your
honor,
i
know
it
cannot
be
the
federal
circuit's
rule
that
you
can
never
have
temporary
flooding
as
a
taking.
and
i
guess
i
would--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--yes.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
yes.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
your
honor,
the
substitute
would
be
to
remain
consistent
with
how
this
court
analyzes
the
physical
takings,
not
use
anything
from
regulatory
analysis
here,
but
looking
at
these
elements.
and
the
--
the
corps
of
engineers
will
need
--
when
they
know
that
it's
predictable,
that
it
is
foreseeable,
as
the
court
below
found,
that
--
that
their
actions
will
place
water
for
storage
on
land
that
they
know
they
can
purchase
flood
easements
for--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
and
because
the
court
said
in
the
cress
case,
it's
the
character
of
the
government's
action,
not
the
amount
of
damages
resulting
from
it,
so
long
as
that
is
substantial.
and
in
the
cases,
the
court
has
looked
at
what
is
substantial
intrusion.
in
loretto,
the
court
said
a
permanent
physical
occupation
on
a
rooftop
in
ms.
loretto's
building,
small
area,
that
is
substantial,
even
though
geographically
it
was
very
small,
because
it
cut
through
these
valuable
property
rights
to
occupy
someone's
property.
and
so
substantial
may
not
have
to
be
very
high.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
your
honor,
i
think
we
would,
again,
use
the
analysis,
separate
out
the
torts,
where
the
action
is
direct,
it's
been
predictable
what
would
that
would
result
in,
the
united
states
should
know
that,
and
then
the
intrusion
or
interference
with
those
property
rights
is
substantial,
there
will
be
a
taking.
usually
that's
not
going
to
be
the
case
in
a
one-time
situation,
as
your
hypothetical.
and,
again,
here
the
court
heard
six
consecutive
years
of
this
invasion
of
water.
the
commission
couldn't
turn
it
away.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
it
is,
your
honor.
where
it's
an
occupation,
it's
certainly
clearer
and
more
intrusive.
there
can
be
invasions
that
don't
amount
to
an
occupation.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
certainly,
your
honor.
substantial--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--you
could
look
at
the
economic
part
--
yes,
definitely,
your
honor.
what
is
substantial
is
going
to
be
made
as
a
legal
determination
by
the
corps,
as
a
matter
of
degree.
and
you
can
look
at
the
extent
of
the
damages
--
if
there
is
destruction
of
property.
destruction
has
been
--
as
in
the
kansas
city
life
case
in
1950,
the
taking
is
to
the
extent
of
the
destruction.
beyond
that,
though,
it's
looking
at
interference
with
use
and
enjoyment--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--the
kansas
city
life
insurance
case
in
1950,
your
honor,
was
underflow
invasion
of
water
percolating
up
on
property
in
missouri
from
the
mississippi
river.
and
that
was
found
to
be
a
substantial
invasion
where
the
property,
the
1700
acres,
was
taken
by
the
united
states.
and
the
court
there
said,
when
you
destroy
the
use
of
that
property
for
what
it
was
being
used
by
the
landowner,
you
owe
to
the
extent
of
the
destruction
that
you
have
caused.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
your
honor,
if
i
may,
after
answering
your
question
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
your
honor,
i
wish
we
could
have
asked
for
affirmance.
there
are
several
other
issues
that
the
federal
circuit
did
not
disturb
or
address.
they
did
not
go
into
the
facts
of,
on
appeal,
that
the
united
states--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--we
want
the
remand
to
say:
apply
the
rule
of
law
here
for
physical
taking
and
look
at
it
as
the
court
of
federal
claims
did:
was
there
a
direct
physical
injury?
did
it
result
in
substantial
intrusion
on
the
commission's
property?
if
so,
the
just
compensation
clause
is
self-actuating
and
there
should
be
just
compensation.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
the
united
states
raised
several
issues
and
the
commission
cross-appealed
in
asking
for
regeneration
damages,
your
honor,
and
those
would
need
to
be
addressed
on
the
remand.
thank
you.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
thank
you.
as
--
as
my
friend
has
said
about
these
damages
being
consequential
and
just
affecting
trees
and
not
--
not
the
land,
the
--
the
court
did
not
find
that
this
was
just
consequential
downstream
damage;
that
this
was
direct,
natural,
and
probable
from
these
releases
that
the
commission
had
protested
and
complained
about
for
years.
that
--
that
that's
in
the
record,
that
they
knew
that
they
were
using
this
land
to
store
this
water.
and
the
commission
could
not
get
their
attention
to
stop
it
until
our
director
--
it
was
on
valentine's
day
in
2001
--
brought
the
appraisal
to
the
corps
of
engineers'
office,
a
whole
roomful
of
people
from
both
sides,
and
placed
that
report
from
--
from
2000,
that
said,
over
$4
million
worth
of
valuable
timber
is
gone,
please
stop.
we
--
we
were
--
we
were
pleading.
so
they
knew.
and
i
think
the
court
of
federal
claims
found
that
they
--
they
had
the
understanding
that
they
were
using
this
to
accommodate
the
farmers
who
were
using
marginally
low
property,
that
the
u.s.
fish
and
wildlife
service
says
in
the
record
probably
should
have
been
cleared
anyway,
but
they
were
wanting
to
provide
and
adjust
the
benefits
for
those
landowners
and
use
the
commission's
property
to
store
the
water.
and,
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
justice
kennedy,
where
the
line
should
be
drawn,
but
the
cases
of
sponenbarger
and
bedford
and
sanguinetti
say
that
when
it's
not
the
united
states'
structure
or
it's
not
the
policy
--
and
the
landowner
cannot
show
that,
that
it's
from
storms
or
from
something
in
nature
--
that's
not
going
to
incur
liability.
even
negligence
may
not
incur
liability
unless
it's
direct
that
what
--
how
it
caused,
and
then
substantial
intrusion.
and,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--your
honor,
under
that
--
under
those
facts,
if
it
could
have
happened
and
the
landowner
knew
that,
and
that
that
is
--
that
is
a
cause,
not
the
united
states,
if
--
if
the
united
states
takes
away
its
flood
protection
and
this
land
goes
back
to
what
it
would
be
naturally,
then
the
landowner
can't
prove
that
it's
direct
from
the
united
states.
the
landowner
would
not
recover
in
that
instance.
in
this
situation,
the
evidence--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--your
honor--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--if
--
if
it's
not
super-induced
invasions
directly
from
the
united
states,
the
landowner
is
going
to
have
that
as
a
natural
condition.
here,
that
was
certainly
not
the
case.
summertime
flooding
of
this
type
never
happened
in
the
recorded
history.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
in
the
pre-dam
or
during
the
whole
first
40
years
of
how
this
was
operated.
it
was
when
it
was
adjusted
that
the
united
states
used
this
land
and
then
took
the
valuable
timber.
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
and
i--
mr.
james
f.
goodhart
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
this
was
directed
naturally,
probably
without
the
--
without
the
interference
or
addition
of
nature.
thank
you,
your
honor.
