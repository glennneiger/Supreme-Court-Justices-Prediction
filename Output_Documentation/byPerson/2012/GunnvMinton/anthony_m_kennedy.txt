let
me
ask
this
question:
suppose
you
have
two
cases,
hypothetical,
case
a,
case
b,
both
involve
the
experimental
use
doctrine
in
federal
patent
law.
in
case
a,
it's
a
very
weak
argument;
it's
most
unlikely
it's
not
going
to
apply.
case
b,
very
strong
argument,
experimental
use
doctrine
applies.
any
difference
in
the
removability
in
those
two
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
--
if
you
say
--
since
you're
going
to
say
it
--
i
mean,
if
it's
a
“
substantial
”
federal
issue,
then
it's
substantial
in
hypothetical
b
but
not
in
hypothetical
a?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
--
let
me
ask
you
this:
the
brighton
miller
treatise
is
rather
complimentary
of
grable,
and
said
it
brought
considerable
certainty
to
the
area.
i
was
pleased
to
hear
that
because
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
true.
[laughter]
but
can
you
just
tell
me,
as
an
--
as
an
empirical
matter,
does
“
arising
under
”
for
removal
jurisdiction
cases
consume
a
tremendous
amount
of
time
in
litigation
in
the
federal
courts?
it's
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
i
mean
is
the
argument
over
“
arising
under
”
over
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
my
question
was
even
broader.
let's
say
we
resolve
legal
malpractice.
then
we
will
have
products
liability
with
a
particular
product,
and
then
we
will
have
some
food
and
agriculture
cases.
it
goes
on
and
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
getting
back,
justice
ginsburg
simply
made
the
point,
i
had
thought,
that
you
place
a
good
deal
of
reliance
on
the
fact
that
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction.
and
her
question
to
me
pointed
out
how
far-reaching
this
case
might
be
because
it
could
involve
patents,
copyright,
all
other
areas
of
exclusive
jurisdiction.
if
that
is
going
to
be
your
special
rule,
it's
not
so
confined
as
you
suggest.
that's
all
that
question
meant
to
me.
certainly
you
could
have
cases
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
1983,
in
which
we'd
have
the
same
problem.
