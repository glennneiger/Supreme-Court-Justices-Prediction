roberts,

we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
number
11-1118,
gunn
v.
minton.
ms.
webre?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
michel.
is
that
correct,
“
michel
”?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
it's
not
their
hypothetical
law.
they
would
be
saying,
this
is
what
we
think
the
federal
law
requires,
and
while
we're
happy
--
or
not
happy
--
but
it's
interesting
that
the
federal
circuit
thinks
something
else,
but
that
doesn't
bind
us.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
webre,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
just
the
flip
side
of
this
case?
let's
suppose
they
said,
no,
you
don't
need
an
expert.
so
it's
not
belt
and
suspenders;
it's
neither
belt
nor
suspenders.
that's
going
to
affect
the
conduct
of
the
lawyers
in
the
state
in
the
way
that
would
be
disruptive
of
the
uniformity
of
federal
patent
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
right,
the
requirements
of
the
federal
law.
the
question
is
there's
going
to
be
a
different
interpretation
of
what
that
means
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
federal
circuit.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1118,
gunn
versus
minton.
legal
malpractice
cases
typically
go
to
state
court.
patent
cases
must
go
to
federal
court.
so,
what
about
a
legal
malpractice
case
that
arises
out
of
the
lawyer's
mishandling
of
a
patent
case?
now,
different
courts
gave
different
answers
to
that
question,
so
we
granted
review
of
this
case
from
texas
to
resolve
that
conflict.
now,
in
most
cases,
it's
pretty
easy
to
tell
which
cases
should
go
where.
if
it's
a
state
law
that
lets
you
sue,
as
in
a
malpractice
case,
you
go
to
state
court.
if
it's
federal
law
that
gives
you
the
right
to
sue,
as
in
a
patent
infringement
case,
you
go
to
federal
court.
but
there
is
a
tiny
group
of
cases
where
you
can
go
to
federal
court
even
though
it's
the
state
law
that
lets
you
sue.
that's
when
the
court
has
to
rule
on
a
very
important
federal
issue
to
decide
the
state
law
claim.
we
had
a
case
about
a
hundred
years
ago
that
has
become
the
classic
example
of
this.
the
claim
was
that
a
bank
could
not
purchase
certain
bonds
because
they
were
invalid.
that's
a
state
law
claim.
it
should
go
to
state
court.
but
the
reason
that
the
bonds
were
claimed
to
be
invalid
was
that
they
were
issued
by
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
government
acted
unconstitutionally
in
issuing
them.
now,
in
that
case,
we
said
that
the
federal
issue
had
such
broader
significance
to
the
federal
system
as
a
whole
that
the
case
could
go
to
federal
court
even
though
the
right
to
sue
came
from
state
law.
but
this
case
isn't
like
that.
now,
it's
true
in
deciding
whether
the
lawyers
were
guilty
of
malpractice,
the
state
court
will
have
to
opine
on
how
the
lawyers
should've
handled
the
patent
case,
a
federal
issue,
but
that
will
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
federal
patent
system.
the
patent
case
itself
is
over,
the
plaintiff
lost.
now,
he
may
win
his
case
claiming
that
his
lawyers
messed
up,
but
that
won't
change
the
result
in
the
patent
case,
nor
will
there
be
any
broader
effect
on
federal
patent
law.
even
if
the
state
court
makes
a
mistake
in
explaining
how
the
patent
case
should've
been
handled,
that
will
not
disrupt
the
uniformity
of
federal
patent
law.
if
the
issue
comes
up
a
lot,
the
federal
courts,
where
actual
patent
cases
are
brought,
will
clear
out
any
confusion
soon
enough.
if
the
issue
does
not
come
up
a
lot,
it
was
not
an
important
one
for
the
system
as
a
whole
in
the
first
place.
so
the
state
legal
malpractice
case
goes
to
state
court
even
though
it
is
about
malpractice
in
a
federal
patent
case.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
