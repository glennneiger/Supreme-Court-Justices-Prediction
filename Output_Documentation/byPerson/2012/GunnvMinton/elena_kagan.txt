justice
elena
kagan
are
you
saying,
mr.
michel,
that
what
the
state
courts
are
going
to
do
is
to
say
that,
notwithstanding
that
the
federal
circuit
has
ruled
on
a
matter,
and
notwithstanding
that
the
lawyer
has
complied
with
the
rule
as
articulated
by
the
federal
circuit,
that
nonetheless,
they
will
be
held
to
have
committed
malpractice
because
they
didn't
comply
with
the
state's
rule?
is
that
what
you
think
the
state
judges
are
really
going
to
do?
justice
elena
kagan
what
if
a
lawyer
says
to
the
--
you
know,
i
complied
with
all
the
federal
law
--
all
the
rules
in
the
federal
circuit,
i
complied
with.
justice
elena
kagan
you
are
suggesting
that
the
state
court
is
going
to
say,
too
bad,
you
committed
malpractice
anyway
because
you
didn't
comply
with
our
hypothetical
law
about
patents.
