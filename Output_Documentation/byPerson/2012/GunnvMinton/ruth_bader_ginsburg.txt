the
question
is
whether
the
experimental
use,
whether
that
was
a
viable
theory.
why
isn't
that
a
substantial
--
what
do
you
mean
by
“
substantial
”?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
substantial
beyond
the
--
this
particular
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
other
areas
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
where
the
claim
if
you
are
stating
it
initially
would
have
to
go
into
federal
court
and
not
state
court?
say,
an
antitrust
claim,
a
copyright
claim.
is
what
you're
saying
about
patents,
does
that
go
for
every
area
where
initial
jurisdiction
is
exclusively
in
the
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what's
the
difference
between,
say,
antitrust
and
patent?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
issue
preclusion
applies
only
to
someone
who
was
a
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
certainly
is
not
binding.
whatever
the
state
--
whatever
the
state
court
says
as
a
matter
of
patent
law
has
no
binding
effect
on
that
question
coming
into
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
happen
--
what
would
happen
if
that
came
up
in
an
ordinary
litigation
in
federal
court,
and
the
federal
circuit
ultimately
decided
the
question,
the
state
court
was
entirely
wrong
about
this;
you
don't
need
a
witness.
well,
that's
the
end
of
it,
right?
once
the
federal
court
decides
the
question,
then
whatever
the
state
judge
thought
was
the
federal
law
is
gone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
anytime
--
anytime
we
allow
patent
questions
--
as
you
already
pointed
out,
a
lot
of
patent
questions
come
up
in
state
courts
litigations,
contract
litigations.
every
time
you
have
a
patent
question,
then
must
the
case
go
to
the
federal
court,
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
is
the
dividing
line
between
patent
questions
that
belong
in
state
court
and
patent
questions
that
belong
only
in
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
does
it
stay
within
the
line
--
you
have
said
not
every
patent
question
that
comes
up
in
a
state
court.
it
--
to
say
you
can
start
over
in
federal
court.
what
patent
questions
--
now,
let's
not
talk
about
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
--
generally,
what
patent
questions
are
properly
adjudicated
in
the
state
court
as
part
of
a
lawsuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
substantial
federal
matter
in
grable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
in
the
control,
the
actions
of
the
federal
agency,
of
irs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
have
no
consequence
for
that
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
federal
court
--
you
said
before
that
whatever
the
federal
circuit
says,
the
state
doesn't
have
to
follow
it
the
next
time
there's
a
case
in
state
court.
but
the
federal
court
is
certainly
not
going
to
follow
what
the
state
says
on
experimental
use.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
--
your
distinction
between
other
areas
of
federal
jurisdiction
where
the
federal
law
controls
and
patent
is
what?
justice
sotomayor
brought
up
immigration
law--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--copyright
law.
why
don't
they
--
why
doesn't
what
you
said
work
the
same
way
in
those
fields?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
case
turns
on
the
federal
circuit
having
exclusive
appellate
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
there's
a
large
federal
interest,
i
mean,
that's
a
--
you're
saying
that
there
is
in
the
federal
state
balance
--
the
federal
balance,
it's
on
the
federal
side.
if
there
is
that
large
federal
interest,
is
it
surprising
that
the
government
hasn't
come
into
this
case
if
there's
such
a
federal
interest
to
be
protected?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
difference
between
you
and
your
colleague
on
what
“
substantial
”
means.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
she
says
it
doesn't
just
mean
necessary,
essential
in
this
particular
litigation,
but
as
in
the
grable
case
and
the
kansas
city
title
&
trust
has
larger
ramifications
for
many
other
cases,
not
just
this
case
and
whether
there's
going
to
be
issue
preclusion
as
to
this
particular
inventor.
those
--
i
don't
see
an
issue
in
this
case
comparable
to
those.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whether
they
--
those
questions
will
come
to
the
federal
circuit
and
they'll
decide
it
and
then
they'll
be
settled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
likely
is
that
in
practice,
that
once
the
federal
circuit
weighs
in,
that
the
state
judges
will
go
their
own
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
that
be
the
same
thing
for
antitrust,
be
the
same
for
copyright?
