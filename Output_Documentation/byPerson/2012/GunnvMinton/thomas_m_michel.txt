mr.
thomas
m.
michel
it
is,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
a
state
court
has
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
a
state
law
patent
malpractice
claim
that
rests
entirely
on
an
issue
of
patent
law
that
is
only
heard
in
federal
court,
and
when
that
issue
is
dispositive,
central
to
the
case,
has
issues
of
first
impression
in
them,
has
no
state
analogue
in
any
other
area
of
the
law,
and
whether
in
the
deciding
issues
of
questions
of
law
and
will
not
disturb
the
balance
between
state
and
federal
judicial
responsibility.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
there
are
many
differences,
your
honor.
first,
antitrust
has
a
state
analogue.
the
texas
supreme
court
in
coca-cola
v.
harmer,
218
southwest--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
yes.
now,
once
again,
the
issues
--
immigration
law
may
be
a
different
area
where
there
is
exclusive
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
that
area,
possibly.
but
once
again,
the
analysis
and
the
application
in
immigration
law
from
a
malpractice
case
may
give
rise
in
that
area.
however--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--that--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--i
believe
in
part.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
does
not
come
within
this
court's
doctrinal
holdings
in
grable
and
empire
because
we
have
a
federal
balancing
and
state
balancing
issue.
and
as
we've
articulated,
when
congress
has
articulated--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
if
i
followed
your
question.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
no,
i
don't
think
anything
that
expressly.
but
the
a&p--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--well,
you
can't
isolate
it.
that
rule
is
more
complicated
because
it
is
the
application
of
the
grable
standard
that's
the
analysis.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
i
think
--
i
think
the
factors
that
go
into
determining
the
--
one
of
the
grounds
that
has
been
articulated
by
grable
and
the
balancing
for
merrell
dow
is
the
number
of
cases
that
would
come
into
federal
court,
and
it
is
a
doctrinal
decision.
it
is
a
doctrinal
rule.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
patent
law
cases--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
those--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--that
is
the
articulation
in
grable,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
sure.
in
many
ways,
your
honor.
first,
the
test
is
uniformity
under
grable,
uniformity
of
patent
law,
federal
law,
not
whether
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--in
many
situations.
for
example,
she
conflates,
petitioners
conflate,
res
judicata
with
issue
preclusion.
that
goes
back
to
your
earlier
question,
justice
sotomayor,
and
that
issue
preclusion
will
have
an
affect,
and
as
in
fact--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--correct.
that
would
only
apply
to
the
inventor;
it
would
not
apply
to
the
pto.
it
can
only
be
used
against
in
this
case
mr.
minton.
and
in
fact,
patent
counsel
in
this
case
under
the
rules
of
the
federal
circuit
under
patent
law
and
the
patent
manual
disclosed
the
state
court's
rulings
in
this
case
to
the
patent
office
during
its
continuing
patent.
the
state
district
court
judge
made
a
scope
and
claim
decision.
so,
justice
sotomayor,
back
to
your
question--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--it
does.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
under
this
court's
decision
marrese
v
the
academy
of
orthopedic
assertions
--
surgeons,
a
state
court's
decision
is
entitled
to
issue
preclusion
even
in
federal
forum.
and
so
that
is
why
--
also
the
patent
--
the
continuation
patent
could
be
declared
invalid
for
failing
to
disclose
that
information.
we
are
not
saying
it's
binding
on
the
pto,
but
it
is
an
issue
of
issue
preclusion
as
against
minton
that
would
be
in
front
of
the
pto
and
is
in
front
of
the
pto
as
we
speak.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
yes.
it
is
a
factor--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--well,
it
is
a
matter
of
issue
preclusion.
this
court
--
that
is
the
danger
of
allowing
these
patent
law
issues
to
proceed
in
state
court.
this
court
--
the
state
district
court
in
this
case
entered
a
brand-new
issue
of
federal
interpretation
--
petitioners
and
respondents
totally
disagree
as
to
whether
this
is
a
fact-specific
case
or
whether
this
case
involves
issues
of
law.
and
in
fact,
we
contend
it
involves
issue
of
first
impression.
in
this
case,
the
state
district
court
made
holdings
about
issues
of
whether
the
question
of
the
experimental
use
exception
is
a
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact.
it
made
--
the
requirement
that
experimental
use
had
to
go
to
a
required
claim
element
as
opposed
to
a
claimed
element.
it
made
the
determination,
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
the
legal
determination
that
knowledge
of
the
buyer
is
conclusive,
rather
than
as
a
factor.
those
are
all
issues
of
not
only
disputed
substantial
issues
of
federal
patent
law
that
both
parties
submitted
briefings
in
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
70
pages
long
disputing
the
legal--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--they're--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--it's
going
to
have
a
really
profound
effect
on
patent
law
practitioners
who
are
uniquely
situated
and
work
in
parcel
--
and
interlocking
with
the
patent
office.
it
is
the
patent
lawyers
who
draft
the
patents,
it
is
the
patent
lawyers
who
present
them
to
the
patent
office,
they
are
the
ones
who
engage
when
they
need
to
be
amended
or
refined
or
narrowed
or
broadened.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
the
patent--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--no,
the
patent
office
will
have
to
take
that
as
guidance,
because
their
new
taskmaster
will
not
be
following
federal
patent
law
because
in
this
case,
the
court
injected
a
brand-new
requirement
that
was
never
held
by
a
patent
lawyer,
that
you
had
to
have
an
expert
witness
testify
to
establish
your
experimental
use
testing
exception.
that's
never
been
held
anywhere
in
federal
patent
law.
so
now,
who's
the
patent
lawyer
going
to
be
looking
to
for
guidance?
the
exclusive
federal
courts?
the
patent
office?
guidance
from
the
federal
circuit?
no,
they
are
going
to
have
their
backs
watched
by
the
state
courts,
saying,
uh-huh
--
you
know
what,
i'm
going
to
impose
a
new
legal
obligation
on
you,
and
you
are
going
to
be
held
for
malpractice.
and
that's
not--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--no,
that's
exactly
the
problem.
state
courts
aren't
bound
by
the
federal
circuit's
holding.
there
will
be
no
federal
review
of
substantial
issues
of
federal
law.
zero,
unless
this
court
is
going
to--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--no,
not
contrary.
that
was
the
point
i
was
going
to
make.
not
contrary
to
the
holdings
of
the
united
states
supreme
court,
contrary
to
the
federal
circuit's
holding.
and
in
fact,
the
fort
worth
court
of
appeals
did
not
follow
the
federal
circuit's
holding
in
this
area.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
i
think
the
state
judges
are
going
to
try
to
possibly
apply
federal
circuit
holdings,
and
in
this
case,
they
did
not.
they
injected
a
new
holding,
which
established
a
new
liability
for
the
patent
lawyers;
which
is
not
reviewable
unless
this
court
were
to
grant
certiorari
review.
and
so
that
then
leaves
the
only
review
on
these
materials
--
these
are
going
to
be
substantial
issues
of--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--it's--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--no.
it's
binding
on
the
state
court
practitioners
in
that
state
who
get
sued
for
legal
malpractice.
and
it's
that
interrelationship
between
the
lawyers
who
are
drafting
patents--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
they
did
that
in
this
case.
at
214--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--correct,
correct.
and
it's
not
just
hypothetical.
the
hypothetical
doesn't
mean
insubstantial.
for
what--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--i
think
we
disagree.
here,
when
you
try
--
for
example,
in
the
patent
infringement
case,
the
sole
trial
is
going
to
be
the
patent
infringement.
you
are
going
to
try
the
federal
lawsuit,
your
honor,
justice
scalia
--
you
are
trying
that
patent
infringement
lawsuit
in
state
court,
in
the
“
case
within
the
case
”
analysis.
the
federal
rules,
that's
what
is
so
troubling
about--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--correct.
but
the
application
and
the
rules
governing
it
are
by
federal
law.
the
rules
in
this
case
--
in
particular,
the
substantial
issue
of
the
experimental
use
exception,
the
only
issue
was
saved
was
the
experimental
use
exception.
we
disagree,
but
just
because
the
state
court
makes
an
opinion
and
a
holding,
it
doesn't
have
real-world
effect.
it
really
does.
it's
not
an
advisory
opinion.
and
there
needs
to
be
a
distinguishment
between
the
side
issue
the
petitioners
are
saying
they
are
trying
to
get
you
focus
on
this
one
micro-issue
of
whether
it
will
affect
an
actual
patent
--
as
to
whether
it
will
affect
patent
law.
and
it
will
affect
patent
law,
and
it
will
affect
the
application
of
patent
law.
and
so
what
you're
going
to
have
is
you're
going
to
have
two
diverging
systems.
you're
going
to
have
--
actually,
you
will
have
one
on
the
federal
side
and
then
you
will
have
50
jurisdictions
espousing
what
they
think
the
law
is
of
patent
law,
and
not
being
bound
by
the
federal
circuit.
the
judge
makes
a--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--no,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
for
example,
not
every
malpractice
case
--
it
will
be
the
“
case
within
the
case
”
doctrine
in
a
patent
case
that
will
go
to
federal
court.
for
example,
failure
to
communicate
a
settlement
offer
does
not
have
a
case
within
the
case.
in
a
business
transaction,
it
doesn't
have
the
case
within
the
case
analysis.
so
those
malpractices
arising
from
them
will
not
go
to
federal
court.
breaches
of
fiduciary
duty
for
divestiture
of
fees
does
not
have
a
causation
element.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
we
do
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
i
think
this
is
a
case
in
point.
this
case
is
on
all
fours
with
grable.
there
is
no
exception.
the
only
distinguishing
factor
is
this
hypothetical
argument
of
the
case
within
the
case
analysis.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
well,
the
--
the
distinction
is,
for
example,
in
a
licensing
case,
in
a
patent
case,
where
you
--
those
cases
are
brought
in
federal
--
i
mean
--
i'm
sorry
--
brought
in
state
court
--
our
--
our
request
here
is
following
grable,
that
what
will
go
to
federal
court
are
legal
malpractice
cases
arising
from
substantial
issues
of
federal
patent
law
that
have
that
case
within
the
case
analysis.
and
it's
that
narrow,
extremely
narrow
window
of
cases.
this
is
not
“
katie,
bar
the
door
”.
we
set
forth
the
empirical
numbers.
they
are
going
to
be
microscopic.
but
what
they
do
have
is
grable's
test.
every
element
that
grable
articulated,
this
case
meets.
it
does
involve
substantial
issues
of
first
impression.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
the
issue
of
the
irs,
whether
personal
service
had
to
be
given
under
an
irs--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
we
do
have
rules
that
will
govern
the
law
on
experimental
use
exception.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
and
that
would
govern
the
application
in
federal
court.
that's
why
it
should
be
in
federal
court,
to
govern
how
the
agency
--
and
whether
a
patent
--
and
this
suit
goes
to
--
directly
affects
patents.
this
is
going
to
patent
validity.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
it
does.
i
will
tell
you,
the
reason
why
it
does,
it's
in
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel.
it
affects
the
inventor.
it's
affecting
the
inventor
in
this
case.
this
holding
of
the
state
district
court
and
the
state
court
of
appeals
are
now
before
the
patent
office.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
there
is
a
pending
continuation
patent.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
yes,
but
that
is
a
collateral
estoppel
issue.
let
me
--
let
me
give
up
another
scenario
because
in
a
different
role
when
the
patent
is
not
declared
invalid
and
instead
there
is
a
finding
of
non-infringement,
and
that's
what
gives
rise
to
the
legal
malpractice
case.
then
you
go
to
state
court,
and
in
that
situation
the
determination
of
--
of
infringement
will
be
raised
as
a
basis
for
legal
malpractice
against
the
lawyer
in
the
malpractice
case.
then
the
lawyers
raise,
as
within
the
“
case
within
the
case
”
exception,
is
that,
oh,
the
patent
was
invalid.
so
then
in
that
situation,
a
state
district
court
will
be
rendering
an
opinion
on
a
live
patent,
and
then
that
will
be
binding
on
the
inventor
and
will
affect
real
live
actual
patents,
and
it
does
affect
patents
before
the
patent
office.
petitioner
said
we
--
it's
not
an
issue
of
res
judicata.
they
cite
a
rule.
that's
not
our
argument.
it's
an
issue
of
issue
preclusion.
it's
also
the
duty
and
the
obligation
of
the
lawyer
to
disclose
that
judicial
discussion
to
the
patent
office.
otherwise
his
continuation
patent
could
be
declared
invalid
for
inequitable
conduct,
for
not
disclosing
material
information.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
distinctions
in
the
area
of
patent
law
versus
any
other
area
of
the
law
mainly
because
as
we
get
to
the
state
--
this
goes
to
the
analysis
of
the
state/federal
balance.
that's
why
the
exclusive
federal
court
jurisdiction.
that's
why
exclusive
nationwide
jurisdiction
in
patent
law
in
the
federal
circuit
is
different
than
any
other
area
of
the
law.
it
is
that
balancing
test
that
we
are
required
to
engage
in.
that's
why
it's
unique
from
antitrust,
trademark,
civil
rights,
securities,
employment.
those
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
they
may
not
have
an
agency
involved.
for
example,
bankruptcy
initially
sounds
like
it's
exclusively
federal
court
issues,
but
when
you
look
underneath
the
bankruptcy,
there
is
core
proceedings
and
there's
non-core.
non-core
are
concurrent;
those
could
be
heard
in
state
court.
secondly,
those
underlying
issues
in
bankruptcy
typically
involve
state
property
right
issues
anyway.
so
they
are
really
applying
whether
somebody
has
a
perfected
security
interest
lien,
whether
somebody
has
a
justified
debt,
whether
--
things
of
that
nature.
so
rather
than
in
any
other
area
of
law,
these
other
areas,
even
if
they
are
exclusive
in
federal
court
jurisdiction,
some
of
those
underlying
issues
are
basically
based
on
who
the
party
is.
and
they
are
still
applying
underlying
state
issues.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
that
is
one
of
the
most
defining
factors
on
the
state/federal
balance
of
judicial
responsibility.
our
understanding
of
that
analysis
of
the
federalism
and
also
the
articulation
of,
just
as
we
have
showed
up
--
petitioners
said
a
whole
ton
of
cases
were
going
to
come
in.
we
supported
statistics
that
the
numbers
will
be
very
small.
but
the
distinguishing
factor
because
of
the
balancing
test
that
we
are
required
to--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--no,
i
think
the
federal
government
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
speculate
to
--
for
that,
justice
ginsburg.
there
could
be
just
many
reasons
why
they
didn't
come
in
on
this
case,
just
like
they
don't
come
in
on
many
other
cases.
but
the
federal
interest
here
in
the
national
uniformity,
i
think,
has
been
well
stated
both
by
this
court
and
the
federal
circuit.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
a
number
of
issues
of
--
of
greater
importance
than
just
this
case.
the
question
is
the
ongoing
conflict
in
federal
patent
law
on
whether
the
experimental
use
exception
is
a
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact.
the
federal
circuit
has
gone
both
ways
on
that,
whether
the
issue
of
buyer
knowledge
is
a
conclusive
factor
or
whether
it
is
just
one
of
13
factors.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
well,
we
would
hope
they
would
be
settled,
but
then
we're
going
to
have
this
whole
other
body
of
law
out
there
in
state
courts
that
aren't
bound
by
the
federal
court
to
answer
those
questions.
and
those
will
govern
the
practice
of
patent
--
patent
lawyers.
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
i
think
it's
a
very
real
possibility.
we've
had--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--you
--
you
would
--
you
would
think
so.
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
the
case.
because
in
this
case,
we
had
holdings
that
experimental
testing
had
to
be
on
a
required
claim
element.
there
is
also
an
issue
in
this
case
of
whether
you
had
to
have
an
expert
witness
testify
to
prove
up
the
experimental
use
exception.
nowhere
held
in
federal
law.
the
problem
is
these
judges
often
will
never
have
handled
a
patent
law
in
their
career.
this
will
go
to
some
judges
who
have
been
in
family
law,
got
elected
at
the
district
court,
and
will
never
have
decided
or
looked
at
a
patent
law
case.
we're
requesting--
mr.
thomas
m.
michel
--but
the
articulation
isn't
the
same.
there
are
other
--
in
antitrust,
there
are
state
analogs,
the
judges
are
familiar
with
applying
it.
in
fact,
the
state
of
texas
in
coca-cola
v.
harmar
stated
that
there's
a
high
interest
in
its
own
state
interest
--
i
mean,
antitrust
laws.
the
same
with
trademark.
trademark
is
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
limited
area
that
applies
these
factors,
going
back
to
the
balancing
test,
is
extremely
narrow.
patent
law
is
unique
in
that
area
of
almost
any
other
area
of
law.
we
think
the
texas
supreme
court
got
this
decision
right,
and
we
request
that
the
court
follow
grable
and
apply
grable
to
the
case
at
hand.
thank
you.
