ms.
jane
webre
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
grable,
this
court
explained
that
arising
under
jurisdiction
demands
not
only
a
contested
federal
issue,
but
a
substantial
one
embedded
in
a
state
claim
in
order
to
indicate
whether
there
is
a
serious
federal
interest
in
exercising
federal
jurisdiction
over
the
state
claim.
this
court
should
reverse
the
judgment
below
because
minton
--
mr.
minton's
claims
do
not
present
a
substantial
federal
issue,
and
exercising
federal
jurisdiction
over
his
claim
and
legal
malpractice
claims
like
his,
state
legal
malpractice
claims
would--
ms.
jane
webre
--well,
your
honor,
defining
substantiality
is
a
difficult
point.
i
would
answer
in
two
layers.
first,
mr.
minton's
claim
did
not
involve
a
legal
question
of
does
the
--
how
does
the
experimental
use
doctrine
work;
how
is
it
applied,
what
are
its
parameters.
the
question
was,
did
his
fact-bound
and
situation-specific
affidavit
present
relevant
evidence
of
the
application
here
in
this
particular
case.
and
it
is
not
a
substantial
question
because,
first,
from
a
unique
case
perspective,
it
involved
merely
a
hypothetical
determination.
there
were
no
actual
patent
rights
that
would
be
at
issue.
those
were
already
fully,
finally,
irrevocably
determined
in
the
underlying
patent
litigation
in
federal
court.
and
second,
from
a
jurisprudence
standpoint,
the
question
of
uniformity
of
patent
law,
any
decision
by
a
state
court
in
mr.
minton's
legal
malpractice
claim
would
not
be
binding
in
any
way
on
either
the
pto
in
a
patent
application,
or
on
any
subsequent
federal
court
deciding
a
real
patent
case.
ms.
jane
webre
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that's
where
the
federal
circuit
jurisdictional
--
the
federal
circuits
“
arising
under
”
jurisdiction
standard
which
the
supreme
court
of
texas
applied
here,
that's
exactly
where
it
goes
awry,
is
that
the
court
improperly
conflates
the
question
of
necessity
of
a
federal
issue
with
the
question
of
whether
that
issue
is
substantial.
and
in
the
grable
case,
this
court
emphasized
that
those
are
two
separate
issues.
there
are
four
prongs
to
the
grable
test:
the
federal
issue
embedded
in
the
state
claim
must
be
necessary
to
the
state
claim;
actually
disputed;
substantial;
and
then
there
is
a
federalism
inquiry
that
exercised
a
federal
jurisdiction
over
this
state
claim
can't
upend
the
proper
balance
between
state
and
federal
authority.
the
grable
court
announced
that,
and
then
just
a
year
later
in
the
empire
healthchoice
case,
your
honor,
justice
ginsburg,
you
wrote
that
opinion
for
the
court,
and
that
acted
sort
of
as
an
underscoring
of
"and
here's
how
limited
the
grable
rule
really
is.
"
the
empire
healthchoice
opinion
distinguishes
between
grable,
which
presented
a
merely
pure
question
of
law,
and
the
claims
at
issue
in
empire
healthchoice
which
were
fact-bound
and
situation-specific.
it
distinguished
the
--
the
question
of
whether
a
state
court
is
competent
to
apply
federal
law
to
the
extent
relevant
to
the
claims
and
found
that,
yes,
it
was.
and
the
court
emphasized
that
certainly
the
state
courts
are
going
to
be
deciding
the
occasional
federal
issue
here
and
there,
but
let's
not
make
a
federal
case
out
of
each
and
every
state
tort
claim
that
might
have
an
embedded
federal
issue.
now,
in
the
earlier
argument,
there
was
some
discussion
of
the
fact
that
jurisdiction
means
a
lot
of
different
things
in
a
lot
of
different
contexts.
but
here,
this
court
has
on
more
than
one
occasion
determined
that
jurisdiction,
“
arising
under
”
jurisdiction,
means
the
same
thing
in
1331,
the
general
federal
question
jurisdictional
grant,
and
1338(a),
the
--
the
exclusive
provision
that's
applicable
specifically
to
patents.
now,
that
has
been
amended
slightly.
it
now
includes
compulsory
counterclaims
where
they
didn't
used
to
be
a
part.
but
the
jurisdictional
grant
that
congress
gave
through
the
first
sentence
of
1338(a)
uses
the
same
exact
phrase,
the
“
arising
under
”,
"any
civil
action
arising
under
federal
law.
"
and
justice
scalia,
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
holmes
group
case
and
explained
that
the
linguistic
consistency
between
those
two
means
that
they
mean
the
same
thing.
there
is
nothing
unique
about
this
subject
matter,
the
patent
subject
matter,
that
changes
the
scope
of
the
jurisdictional
grant.
to
be
sure,
the
grant
of
original
jurisdiction
to
the
district
courts
is
exclusive
and
that
is
different
from
the
general
federal
question.
ms.
jane
webre
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
congress
did
that
in
a
couple
of
different
ways.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
begs
the
question,
it
begs
the
core
question,
to
say
that
exclusive
--
the
fact
that
jurisdiction
is
exclusive
answers
the
substantiality,
because
in
order
to
get
to
exclusivity
of
the
jurisdiction
you
have
to
get
to
jurisdiction
first.
you
have
to
--
it
has
to
be
arising
under
an
act
of
congress
relating
to
patents
before
it
can
then
be
exclusive.
so
--
so
we
still
have
the
first
step.
but
also,
congress
did
not
cast
a
net
broader
than
the
general
“
arising
under
”
standard.
even
under
the
statutory
framework
after
the
america
invents
act
amendment,
under
the
statutory
structure
there
are
still
a
number
of
patent
issues,
legal
issues
that
are
going
to
be
decided
in
the
state
courts,
that
do
not
come
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
for
example,
compulsory
counterclaims
now
come
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction,
but
permissive
counterclaims
don't.
permissive
counterclaims
can
certainly
present
just
as
substantive
a
question
of
patent
law,
and
yet
those
are
excluded
under
the
statutory
scheme
of
1338(a).
patent
issues
raised
as
a
defensive
matter
are
not
sufficient
to
support
“
arising
under
”
jurisdiction
under
1338(a).
so
certainly,
congress
contemplated
a
situation
where
some
patent
issues
are
just
not
going
to
come
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
and
i
think
it's
interesting
to
back
up
a
little
bit
and
look
at
the
federal
circuit's
evolved
perception
of
its
own
exclusive
jurisdiction.
in
the
early
years
of
the
federal
circuit
in
1984,
the
first
chief
justice
--
the
first
chief
judge
of
the
court,
chief
judge
markey,
in
the
atari
case
that
is
cited
at
page
21
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
american
intellectual
property
lawyers
association,
the
federal
circuit
wrote,
"congress
was
not
concerned
that
an
occasional
patent
law
decision
of
a
regional
circuit
court
or
of
a
state
court
would
defeat
its
goal
of
increased
uniformity
in
the
national
law
of
patents.
"
that
was
the
view
of
the
federal
circuit's
own
jurisdiction
in
1984.
but
in
the
time
evolved,
the
federal
circuit
has
changed
its
perception
of
its
own
jurisdiction
and
that's
why
we
are
here
today.
in
2007,
the
federal
circuit
went
awry
and
--
and
changed
the
standard
that
no
longer
follows
what
this
court
articulated
in
grable.
they
have
improperly
conflated
the
necessity
and
substantiality
components
of
the
--
of
an
appropriate
grable
analysis,
and
they
totally
disregard
a
proper
balance
of
the
state
and
federal
interests.
the
federal
circuit
announced
that
there's
an
interest
in
--
federal
interest
in
uniformity
of
patent
law,
and
then
that
was
that.
that
was
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
there
is
no
balance
if
you
don't
look
at
the
state
interest
on
the
other
side.
and
in
legal
malpractice
cases
in
general
and
in
mr.
minton's
claim
in
particular,
there
are
substantial
state
interests.
there
is
the
general
interest,
the
right
of
a
state
to
develop
its
own
state
claims,
its
own
state
law
and
its
own
state
courts.
but
there
is
also
a
state
interest
in
governing
the
relationship
between
attorney
and
client
that
happens
through
the
legal
malpractice
process.
but
specifically
with
regard
to
mr.
minton's
claim,
one
of
his
primary
theories
in
this
case,
in
the
legal
malpractice
case,
is
that
the
attorney's
error
with
regard
to
bringing
up
the
experimental
use
doctrine
deprived
him
of
the
opportunity
to
make
a
lucrative
settlement
with
the
nasd
in
the
underlying
patent
litigation.
well,
the
question
of
exactly
how
you
prove
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
nasd
would
have
paid
a
settlement
and
for
how
much
in
the
underlying
case
is
a
matter
of
tremendous
dispute
right
now.
that
is
an
evolving
issue
in
the
--
in
the
legal
malpractice
jurisprudence
of
the
state
of
texas.
in
fact,
in
the
month
of
december
2012,
the
supreme
court
of
texas
heard
argument
in
a
case
called
elizondo
v.
krist
that
addresses
that
precise
issue:
how
do
you
prove
that
nasdaq
would
have
paid
him
$100
million
if
only
these
lawyers
had
raised
this
issue
earlier?
and
yet,
if
mr.
minton's
claims
are
hailed
into
federal
court
because
of
the
fact-bound
and
situation-specific
application
of
the
experimental
law
doctrine,
the
federal
courts
would
be
--
to
that
important
issue
that
the
state
courts
really
need
to
resolve.
ms.
jane
webre
no,
your
honor.
ms.
jane
webre
in
neither
direction
would
any
decision
be
binding.
the
state
--
any
decision
in
a
state
court
on
a
legal
malpractice
matter
regarding
issues
of
patent
law
would
not
be
binding
in
any
way
on
the
federal
courts
or
on
the
pto
in
handling
any
of
the
patent
applications,
prosecution
of
patents.
ms.
jane
webre
you
are
right
that
it
will
not
substantially
adversely
impact
texas
state
law,
but
that's
an
illustration
of
a
substantial
state
interest.
in
a
way,
it's
akin
to
the
issue
in
grable,
because
the
--
the
embedded
issue
in
grable
that
justified
this
court
reaching
down
and
grabbing
a
state
law
claim
and
bringing
it
up
into
federal
court
wasn't
just
that
the
issue
was
disputed,
the
construction
of
that
statute
was
unresolved;
but
that
it
needed
resolving.
it
needed
resolving
by
a
court
whose
decision
could
be
precedential
so
then
it's
resolved
from
then
on.
and
so
the
question
of
how
do
you
prove
a
settlement
is
an
issue
that
needs
resolving
by
a
court
who's
going
to
advance
the
jurisprudence.
ms.
jane
webre
there
are
no
federal
issues
that
need
resolving
here,
because
it's
solely
a
question
of
the
application
of
these
specific
facts
in
this
affidavit
to
the
doctrine.
there's
--
there's
no
overarching
question
of
patent
law
that
needs
resolving.
ms.
jane
webre
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
question
isn't
the
significance
to
the
particular
claim.
the
question
is
the
federal
issue.
is
there
a--
ms.
jane
webre
--well,
it's
perhaps
more
necessary.
but
--
and
maybe
what
i
need
to
do
is
back
up
a
little
bit
and
discuss
what
i
think
are
the
factors
for
a
court
to
look
at
when
deciding
whether
or
not
an
embedded
federal
issue
is
a
substantial
one.
in
looking
at
this
court's
articulation
in
the
grable
case
and
the
empire
healthchoice
case,
the
issues
that
the
court
looked
at,
one
was
the
nature
of
the
federal
--
of
the
federal
question
itself,
the
federal
issue,
is
it
a
constitutional
issue.
ms.
jane
webre
that
would
be
a
more
substantial
federal
question
than
the
one
presented
here,
but
i
submit
that
it
would
not
be
sufficient
to
warrant
“
arising
under
”
jurisdiction
here,
because
it
is
--
it
involves
only
a
hypothetical
actual
set
of
patent
rights.
no
judgment
that
can
happen
in
a
state
legal
malpractice
case
actually
impacts
any
patent
rights.
let's
say
mr.
minton
won
a
judgment
from
a
state
legal
malpractice
court
saying
it
was
the
negligence,
that
you
would
have
won
the
experimental
use
exception,
your
patent
would
have
been
declared
valid,
and
so
he
has
a
judgment
from
a
state
court
saying,
the
loss
of
your
patent
was
the
result
of
a
negligence
and
not
because
it
was
actually
invalid.
that
doesn't
give
him
a
valid
patent.
he
cannot
take
that
judgment
and
then
sue
somebody
and
say,
look,
look,
i've
got
a
patent.
and
it's--
ms.
jane
webre
--yes.
so--
ms.
jane
webre
--well,
the
--
the
--
in
the
continuum
constitutional
issues
would
be
more
substantial,
statutory
issues
would
be
a
little
less
substantial.
in
fact,
this
court
grappled
with
that
in
the
grable
case
and
said,
we're
not
going
to
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line
on
statutory
issues,
but
then
in
the
empire
healthchoice
opinion,
the
court
noted
that
this
is
a
non
--
the
issue
--
the
federal
issue
there
was
nonstatutory,
and
so
therefore,
let's
not
make
a
federal
case
out
of
it.
so
in
that
continuum,
that
would
be
one
factor
to
look
at.
another
factor
to
look
at
would
be,
is
the
federal
issue,
the
legal
issue
undisputed
or
uncertain?
not
necessarily
the
application
of
these
particular
facts
to
the
legal
issue,
because
there
really
isn't
a
federal
interest
in
how
this
affidavit
is
construed
or
not,
but
in
--
in
the
resolution
of
the
legal
issues,
as
in
grable,
is
the
question
of
law
disputed
or
uncertain,
and
the
corollary
to
that
is,
does
it
need
resolving,
because
that
was
the
situation
in
the
grable
case.
but
just
because
an
issue
is
novel
doesn't
ipso
facto
make
it
a
--
a
substantial
issue.
this
court
in
the
merrell
dow
case
discussed
that.
ms.
jane
webre
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jane
webre
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
urge
that
because
i
think
that's
the
only
appropriate
application
of
the
grable
test
to
legal
malpractice
cases.
and
it's
not
that--
ms.
jane
webre
--i
think
there
are
two
reasons.
there
are
two
reasons
why
that's
the
only
appropriate
way
to
apply
the
grable
test
to
legal
malpractice
cases,
and
both
of
them
involve
the
lack
of
precedent
from
the
case.
one
is
it
can
never
involve
actual
patent
rights.
the
consequence
of
a
judge's--
ms.
jane
webre
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
it
would
not
affect
the
patent
office
either
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
or
as
a
matter
of
issue
preclusion,
non-mutual
issue
preclusion
or
as
a
matter
of
jurisprudential
precedence.
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
one
is
that
as
a
starting
point,
the
--
the
question
of
attorney
misconduct
can
affect
the
issuance
of
a
patent
before
the
patent
office,
but
that
would
happen
not
in
the
context
of
a
legal
malpractice
claim,
but
in
the
context
of
the
actual
prosecution
of
the
patent
before
the
pto
itself.
so
the
pto
would
have
made
a
--
its
own
determination
and
granted
or
not
granted
limited
sanction,
whatever
action
it
is
the
pto
takes
in
--
before
--
in
a
proceeding
before
itself,
the
pto
would
be
deciding
that.
so
a
legal
malpractice
case
would
only
be
subsequent
to
that.
so,
in
--
in
the
first
instance,
the
pto
gets
to
decide
that.
from
a
res
judicata
standpoint,
the
pto's
patent
review
manual,
the
manual
of
examination
of
patents
provides
that
res
judicata
effect
is
only
given
to
decisions
by
either
the
board
of
patent
review
or
interferences,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
and
the
federal
circuit.
no
state
courts
make
that
list.
so
from
a
res
judicata
standpoint,
only
going
right
up
the
chain
is
going
to
bind
the
pto.
and
from
an
issue
preclusion
standpoint,
the
pto
would
never
be
a
party,
could
never
be
a
party
to
a
--
a
legal
malpractice
claim
and,
therefore,
would
not
be
bound
by
any
state
court
decision.
and
what's
kind
of
a
funny--
ms.
jane
webre
--the
pto
may
not
ignore
it.
the
pto--
ms.
jane
webre
--well,
but--
ms.
jane
webre
--no,
your
honor,
you
do
not
have
to
go
to
my
absolute
rule.
i
think
that
the
absolute
rule
is
the
--
the
most
sensible
and
appropriate
application
of
the
grable
test
to
state
law
legal
malpractice
claims,
and
it
has
the
added
benefit
of
certainty.
it
--
it
doesn't
roll
us
back
to
the
justice
holmes'
rule.
ms.
jane
webre
well--
ms.
jane
webre
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
take
it
a
step
further
than
that,
because
i
think
that
any
actual
impact
of
--
of
what
you're
positing,
justice
sotomayor,
is
so
ephemeral.
the
idea
that
--
that
the
pto
will
look
at
a
fact-finding
in
a
legal
malpractice
case,
and
oh,
goodness,
i
didn't
realize
there
was
this
suppression
of
evidence,
i'm
now
going
to
dig
further.
well,
that's
such
a
speculative
and
ephemeral
possibility,
it
doesn't
disrupt
the
fabric
of
patent
jurisprudence,
patent
law
in
any
way,
and
it
doesn't
tie
the
hands
of
the
pto
in
any
way.
it
doesn't
bind
the
pto
in
any
future
consideration
of
a
continuation
patent
or
any
other
related
continuation
in
part
patent.
ms.
jane
webre
well,
it
--
it
does
a
couple
of
things.
first
is,
it
consumes
a
lot
of
time
of
the
courts
and
the
litigants
in
removing
and
then
getting
remanded
again
and
it
--
as
is
discussed
in
the--
ms.
jane
webre
--there
are,
on
this
issue
of
the
legal
malpractice
cases,
in
the
wake
of
the
federal
circuit's
opinions,
the
air
measurement
case
and
immunocept
case
in
2007,
scores
and
scores
and
scores
of
courts,
state
and
federal
courts,
have
been
grappling
with
this
precise
jurisdictional
issue.
i
think
this
case
is
about
the
fifth
or
sixth
cert
petition
that
came
up
to
this
court
on
this
jurisdictional
question.
i
think
there
are
three
or
four
behind
us
in
queue,
and
there
continues
to
be
uncertainty
in
the
lower
courts
on
this
precise
issue.
and
it
really
presents
for
this
court
a
question
of
is
“
arising
under
”
jurisdiction
truly
a
lenient
standard,
as
the
federal
court
has
articulated.
now,
it's
true
that
the
entire
body
of
state
law
legal
malpractice
cases
arising
out
of
patent
representation
is
not
going
to
overwhelm
the
federal
court.
it's
not
going
to--
ms.
jane
webre
--i
think
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
--
that's
a
substantial
issue.
but,
like
justice
scalia
said,
that
--
you
know,
this
court
departed
from
justice
holmes'
construct
some
years
ago.
but
i
think
that
there
is
the
opportunity
in
this
case
to
provide
a
great
deal
of
certainty,
to
provide
absolute
certainty
vis
--
vis
legal
malpractice
cases
because
of
their
unique
hypothetical
aspect.
the
consequence
of
the
judgment
affects
no
rights.
but
second,
in
reaffirming,
rearticulating
the
grable
test,
emphasizing
the
importance
and
the
separateness
of
the
substantiality
inquiry,
emphasizing
the
importance
of
the
federalism
aspect,
this
court
has
a
great
opportunity
to
resolve
a
lot
of
uncertainty.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
jane
webre
i
disagree,
your
honor.
the
texas
supreme
court
didn't
properly
apply
grable.
what
they
applied
was
the
federal
circuit's
improper
departure
from
grable.
in
two
ways.
one
is
they
conflated
necessity
with
substantiality
and
that
comes,
in
the
federal
circuit's
jurisprudence,
that
comes
from
a
sound
bite
from
the
earlier
christiansen
case
where
the
--
the
--
the
line
goes
something
like,
there
is
a
substantial
federal
issue
because
it
is
necessary
to
the
parties'
claim.
and
so
it
conflates
necessity
with
substantiality,
and
the
--
the
texas
supreme
court
followed
the
federal
circuit's
construct.
they
said,
we're
applying
grable,
we're
looking
at
substantiality,
but
then
they
did
exactly
what
the
federal
circuit
did.
and
ditto
with
--
with
the
federalism
balance.
they
pointed
to
the
needs
of
federal
interest
in
the
uniformity
of
patent
law
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
measure
of
the
deference
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
as
other
state
courts
would
do,
the
deference
they
grant
to
the
federal
circuit
in
deciding
the
question
of
appropriate
scope
of
patent
jurisprudence
and
the
relative
importance
of
the
--
the
uniformity
of
patent
law.
and
so
we
arrive
to
you
from
the
supreme
court
of
texas,
but
truly
presenting
the
--
the
appropriateness
of
the
federal
circuit's
redone
application
of
the
grable
test.
ms.
jane
webre
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
is
such
a
speculative
road
to
go
down.
what
is
it
the
lawyers
are
going
to
do
different?
a
lawyer--
ms.
jane
webre
--they
are
going
to
do
some
extra
work
and
make
an
extra
belt
along
with
the
suspenders
that
they
are
required
to
do.
and
where
is
the
harm
in
that?
and
where
is
the
undermining
of
the
uniformity
of
patent
law
if
a
lawyer
in
a
real
patent
case--
ms.
jane
webre
--your
honor,
i
think
that
--
that
spinning
out
a
hypothetical
on
that
would
be
truly
speculative.
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
where
it
would
be
contrary
or
intentioned
with
what
the
federal
courts
would
hold.
particularly
since
it's
--
i
agree
with
justice
scalia's
construct
that
the
state
courts
are
going
to
try
to
apply
appropriate
federal
law--
ms.
jane
webre
--if
an
expert
is
required
under
federal
jurisprudence,
then
an
expert
is
required
in
a
real
patent
case.
and
if
the
state
court
makes
the
mistake
in
an
occasional
case
here
or
there,
then
a
lawyer
practicing
in
a
real
patent
case,
in
a
real
case
in
federal
court,
needs
to
make
sure
that
they
are
complying
with
the
requirements.
and
if
you're
going
to--
ms.
jane
webre
--well,
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
conflict,
then
what
you're
supposed
to
follow
is
the
jurisprudence
of
the
courts
who
--
before
whom
you
are
practicing.
if
the
federal
circuit
or
federal
district
court
has
said
something
about
patent
law,
then
that's
what
the
lawyers
should
follow
in
prosecuting
a
patent
case.
and
a
lawyer
who
decides,
i'm
going
to
disregard
the
federal
circuit
standards
on
that
question
--
expert
required,
whatever
it
is
--
and
instead
follow
the
fort
worth
court
of
appeals
on
this
issue,
i
submit
that
the
lawyer
does
so
at
his
peril,
and
that
doesn't
undermine
the
appropriate
uniformity
of
patent
law.
