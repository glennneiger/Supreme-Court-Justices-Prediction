justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
webre,
is
there
any
binding
effect
of
a
federal
determination
here
on
state
law,
and
is
there
any
binding
effect
of
any
state
determination
here
on
federal
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
left
to
the
state,
would
what
the
states
say
about
patent
law
be
binding
in
any
federal
cases,
and,
vice
versa,
if
it
went
to
the
federal
jurisdiction,
would
anything
that
the
federal
court
says
about
--
about
state
tort
law
be
binding
on
state
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that
being
so,
your
--
your
last
argument
about
the
federal
government
messing
up
--
you
know,
state
tort
law
in
an
area
that
--
that
is
currently
very
much
in
the
fore
in
the
--
in
the
decisions
of
the
texas
supreme
court,
that
doesn't
really
carry
a
lot
of
weight,
except
in
this
single
case.
i
mean,
they
are
not
going
to
mess
up
texas
law
in
that
regard.
they
may
get
this
case
wrong,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
the
federal
issue?
doesn't
that
need
resolving?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
do
all
--
why
do
all
of
these
issues
cut
in
your
favor
in
all
cases
involving
malpractice?
i
mean,
you're
urging
not
just
that
your
client
win
here,
but
you
want
us
to
adopt
a
general
rule
that
malpractice
suits
involving
patent
rights
can
never,
ever,
come
under
“
federal
arising
”
under
jurisdiction.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
what
you
want
us
to
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
burden
would
be
on
you
to
show
that
every
one
of
these
factors
in
all
of
those
cases
is
always
going
to
cut
in
your
favor.
that
--
what,
that
they
will
never
involve
a
constitutional
issue?
that
they
will
never,
ever
determine
future
patent
decisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
like
--
i
like
bright-line
rules.
in
fact
--
you
know,
i
thought
holmes
had
it
right.
it
doesn't
arise
under
unless
the
cause
of
action
is
a
federal
cause
of
action.
but
once
we've
gone
down
--
down
the
road
of
grable,
i
don't
--
you're
--
you're
proving
a
negative.
the
burden
is
on
you
to
prove
a
negative,
that
there
is
no
situation
that
can
arise
in
--
in
malpractice
cases
involving
patents
where
the
federal
issue
would
justify
arising.
a
hard
road
to
hoe.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
you
might
argue
that
even
if
it
fails
the
grable
test
in
a
couple
of
isolated
cases,
we
should
still
adopt
that
rule,
because
the
benefits
of
having
a
clear
rule
that
doesn't
have
to
be
litigated
in
every
--
every
case
outweigh
the
fact
that
one
or
two
might
--
might
not
come
out
that
way
if
we
applied
grable.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
we're
making
it
up
anyway,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
guess
i
just
don't
understand
this.
is
it
the
case
that
there
is
“
arising
under
”
jurisdiction
only
when
the
federal
cause
of
action
presented
is
one
over
which
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
any
federal
statute
that
can
be
sued
upon
both
in
federal
courts
and
in
state
courts,
but
as
to
which
federal
courts
are
the
dispositive
adjudicators,
you
say
that
that
does
not
come
within
this
“
arising
under
”
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
case
for
that,
that
says
if
a
suit
could
be
brought
in
state
court
even
though
it
involves
a
dispositive
federal
question
as
to
which
this
court
would
be
the
--
you
know,
the
last
interpreter,
it
cannot
possibly
come
within
“
arising
under
”
jurisdiction?
have
you
got
a
case
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
a
case
which
says
that
when
a
federal
question
is
presented
in
a
case
over
which
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
but
also
state
courts
have
jurisdiction,
although,
needless
to
say,
the
federal
courts
would
be
dispositive
on
the
issue,
such
a
case
cannot
come
within
the
“
arising
under
”
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
find
it
extraordinary
for
that
to
be
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
--
my
goodness,
but
you
are
going
to
have
a
purely
hypothetical
state
decision
here.
the
state
will
have
held
that
--
you
know,
if
he
had
said
this,
the
result
would
have
been
something
else.
and
you
think
that
that
precludes
the
issue
when
it
arises
in
real
life?
and
you
say
since
the
state
court
made
that
hypothetical
determination
it
precludes
me
from
arguing
it
in
real
life?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
cases
like
that?
it
seems
to
me
a
rather
weird,
weird
situation.
i
mean,
maybe
it
could,
but
it's
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
knew
--
they
knew
these
were
controverted
issues.
you
say
that
they
are
controverted
issues.
so
they
would
have
been
alerted
to
a
problem
anyway,
and
they
certainly
would
not
accept
a
state
court
determination
as
authoritative
resolution
of
that
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
patent
attorneys.
i
mean,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
the
state
courts
are
not
bound
by
the
federal
court's
holding?
you
mean
state
courts
can
resolve
patent
questions,
contrary
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
says
the
law
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
worse
than
the
fact
that
if
it
goes
to
federal
court,
all
of
the
lawyers
in
the
state
in
all
malpractice
cases
are
going
to
be
supposedly
bound
by
the
federal
court's
holding
as
to
state
issues
of
malpractice?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
it's
twiddle
dum
or
twiddle
dee,
whichever
court
system
you
go
to,
you
are
going
to
terrorize
the
lawyers
of
that
state
on
the
basis
of
an
opinion
of
a
court
that
is
not
dispositive
on
those
issues.
so
i
don't
know
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
are
trying
the
malpractice
lawsuit,
the
state
practice
malpractice
lawsuit,
in
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
talking
about
a
patent
case
that
has
a
patent
issue,
whether
it's
a
contract
case,
a
tort
case,
a
malpractice
case
--
if
it
has
a
patent
issue,
you
think
it
has
to
go
to
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
i
repeat
justice
ginsburg's
question,
how
do
you
decide
which
of
those
do
and
which
of
those
don't?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
experience
is
that
federal
judges,
including
this
federal
judge,
are
not
interested
in
--
in
getting
into
the
weeds
of
patent
law,
and
if
--
if
they
could
rely
on
a
decision
of
the
federal
circuit,
they
would
do
that
just
as
fast
as
they
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
webre,
can
i
ask
you
about
the
question
presented?
the
way
you
presented
it
to
us,
it
--
it
was
as
though
we're
--
we're
reviewing
whether
the
federal
circuit
was
right
to
reject
grable
in
--
in
whatever
the
names
of
those
opinions
are.
but
in
fact,
that's
not
the
situation
at
all.
the
texas
supreme
court
here
applied
grable.
and
i
think
just
the
way
you
would
want
it
applied.
so
your
--
your
--
your
contention
is
simply
they
didn't
apply
it
correctly.
isn't
that
right?
