justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
does
that
mean
that
if
the
claim
in
the
malpractice
action
is
that
the
pto
acted
unconstitutionally
--
assume
that
set
of
facts
--
how
does
that
change
your
analysis?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
go
back
to
--
you
were
going
through
a
list
of
questions,
and
i
posited,
let's
assume
that
the
malpractice
claim
does
involve
a
constitutional
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
what
other
factors--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
about
fraud
on
--
a
claim
of
fraud
on
--
that
the
malpractice
was
fraud
on
the
pto?
lawyer
loses
that.
it's
been
litigated.
isn't
it
res
judicata,
and
won't
it
affect
the
patent
or
might
it
not
affect
the
patent
in
a
patent
action?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
find
that
somewhat
hard
to
follow.
let's
assume
in
adjudicating
a
medical
--
a
malpractice
claim,
the
state
court
finds
that
the
attorney
suppressed
information.
it's
a
finding
of
fact.
he
has
this
information
in
his
or
her
file,
and
they
didn't
disclose
it.
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
the
pto
ignores
that
litigation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
the
district
court
does,
if
it
gets
to
review
that
in
a
later
action.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
only
raising
this
question
to
address
justice
scalia's
point.
you're
asking
for
an
absolute
rule,
and
i
posited
a
situation
where
i
think
it's
not
so
clear
that
a
state
court
finding
might
not
have
an
effect.
so,
do
we
have
to
go
to
your
absolute
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
immigration
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
don't
get
in
the
weeds.
take
immigration
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
patent
law
cases
of
malpractice
are
smaller
in
number
than
copyright
cases--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
immigration
and
other
exclusive
jurisdictions,
so
that's
okay
to
remove,
but
those
others
aren't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--does
that
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
about
a
different
one,
the
one
that's
being
proposed
by
your
adversary,
which
is
define
“
substantial
”
as
to
how
it
affects
federal
law,
which
i
think
was
the
bottom
line
--
or
the
development
of
federal
law,
the
bottom
line
of
grable.
and
she
says
--
you
dispute
this
in
your
brief
--
that
it
doesn't
affect
the
invalidated
patent,
that
there's
no
way
that
a
judgment
on
the
malpractice
is
going
to
be
used
in
a
continuation
patent
dispute
because
it's
not
one
of
the
listed
preclusive
courts.
so,
how
does
a
ruling
affect
patent
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
is
--
who's
going
to
follow
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
besides
the
parties--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
else
does
it
affect
the
development
of
patent
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
else
is
going
to
follow--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--this
malpractice
determination?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you're
arguing,
they're
going
to
make
a
mistake,
and
because
we
might
not
accept
certiorari,
that's
binding
on
everybody
else--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
the
state--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
how
does
it
--
the
patent's
invalid.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
patent's
invalid.
nothing
the
court
does
here
is
going
to
change
that
invalidity.
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he's
not
going
to
get
his
patent
back
from
this
action.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he's
going
to
get
money
for
losing
it,
maybe.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
does
it
affect
the
patent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we're
back
to
that
issue,
okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
answer
the
one
point
your
adversary
raised
that
gives
me
pause,
a
lot
of
pause.
he
says
a
ruling
on
patent
law
of
how
you
should
or
should
not
behave
in
a
state
malpractice
claim
will
affect
all
of
the
lawyers
who
practice
in
your
state,
because
each
of
them
will
have
to
do
or
not
do
whatever
that
malpractice
ruling
was
because
that's
what
the
state
is
going
to
--
state
courts
will
follow
in
the
future.
so
it
will
change
those
lawyers'
behaviors
in
federal
court.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
are
going
to
present
an
expert
all
of
the
time
when
they
don't
need
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
can
think
of
an
example
where
--
not
perhaps
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
where
a
state
court's
ruling
could
in
fact
establish
a
code
of
behavior
that's
not
just
belts
and
suspenders,
that's
something
else.
