justice

(b)(4)
is
about
--
(b)(4)
is
about
very
sensitive
information.
you're
talking
about
people's
social
security
numbers.
you're
talking
about
whether
the
person
has
a
disability
that
they
may
not
want
to
disclose
to
the
general
public,
a
person
has
parkinson's
or
epilepsy
or
is
diabetic.
so
you're
saying
lawyers,
they
get
all
that
stuff.
nobody
else
can,
but
lawyers
are
a
privileged
class
and
they
get
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
congress
wanted
to
draw
the
line
between
possible,
you
know,
some
unknown
lawsuit
and
an
actual
lawsuit
that's
in
the
mind
of
the
lawyer,
why
did
it
use
the
term
litigation
when
it
had
already
used
earlier
in
the
same
subsection
proceeding,
civil,
criminal,
administrative,
or
arbitral
proceeding?
