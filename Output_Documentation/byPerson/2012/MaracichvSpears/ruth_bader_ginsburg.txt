it
says
anticipation
of
litigation
in
connection--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
only
ongoing
litigation,
but
it
can
be
used
in
connection
with
anticipation
of
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
recognize
that
you
could
use
(b)(4)
to
identify
class
members?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
it's
a
solicitation,
suppose
this
information
was
a
recent
automobile
purchaser
was
asks:
did
you
buy
a
car
recently?
were
you
charged
this
additional
fee?
period.
that
would
be
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
come
under
(b)(4).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understood
your
prior
answer.
you
said,
i
thought,
that
it
would
have
been
okay
to
get
the
information
from
the
bureau
and
then
ask,
did
you
buy
a
car
recently?
did
you
have
this
additional
charge?
now,
suppose
--
you
said
that
was
all
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
that
--
wasn't
that
crystal-clear
here,
because
the
dealers
were
saying,
you
can't
go
forward
unless
you
have
a
plaintiff
to
match
every
dealer.
you're
trying
to
bring
a
representative
action,
but
your
list
of
plaintiffs,
none
of
them
bought
from
dealer
z.
so,
we
are
investigating
to
see
if
we
can
have
a
representative
action
with
a
line-up
of
plaintiffs,
each
of
whom
has
purchased
from
a
list
of
defendants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
we
had
--
it
was
limited
to
--
to
class
notice
--
somebody
who--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
have
just
those
questions,
no
--
are
you
interested
in
joining
a
lawsuit,
please
call
us.
but
somebody
who
receives
this
notice,
it
just
asks,
did
you
buy
a
car,
do
you
pay
the
charge,
then
calls
the
lawyer's
office
and
says,
tell
me
something
about
this
letter
that
you
told
me
--
that
you
--
you
sent
to
me.
and
how
does
the
lawyer
answer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow,
that
they
are
describing
only
what
goes
on
in
the
court.
if
you
just
took
the
phrase
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation,
in
anticipation
of
sounds
like
before
litigation
begins.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
know
why
this
case
doesn't
fit
that
description,
because
the
position
that
the
dealers
were
taking
was,
you
can't
--
you
ought
to
maintain
a
representative
action.
the
state
has
such
an
animal,
not
quite
a
class
action,
representative
action.
to
qualify,
the
group
must
be
numerous.
so
how
am
i
going
to
find
out
if
it's
numerous
without
asking
these
questions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
might
that
get
the
lawyer
into
some
difficulty
with
the
bar
association?
they'll
look
at
this
and
say:
look,
we
told
you
if
you
are
--
if
you
are
seeking
clients,
then
you
have
to
put
advertising
material.
and
a
letter
like
that
would
tip
the
recipient
off
to:
something
is
going
on,
i
should
find
out
about
it
and
maybe
i
should
join
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
there
is
a
whole
string
of
defendants
who
were
doing
the
same
thing,
the
same
allegedly
unlawful
practice,
they
couldn't
reach
without
getting
additional--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
their
client
as
a
group,
this
is
not
an
individual
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
statute
says
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
you
--
you
said
that
you
had
a
few
people
came
and
complained
to
the
lawyers
and
then
the
lawyers
wanted
to
see
how
widespread
this
was.
suppose
the
lawyer
herself
bought
a
car
recently
and
she
got
this
administrative
fee,
and
now
she
has
no
clients
who
have
approached
her
but
she
would
like
to
find
out
how
many
similarly
situated
people
there
are
so
she
can
get
one
of
these
representative
actions
going.
could
--
on
that
basis
would
it
be
permissible
to
use
--
would
that
come
under
the
litigation
exception?
