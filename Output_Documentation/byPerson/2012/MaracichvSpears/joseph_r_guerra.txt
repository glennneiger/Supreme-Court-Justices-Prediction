mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
dppa
requires
express
consent
when
personal
information
in
the
dmv
databases
is
used
for
bulk
solicitation.
the
express
consent
requirement
is
congress's
considered
response
to
one
of
the
core
problems
that
the
dppa
targets,
and
the
litigation
exception
creates
no
exception
for
lawyers.
in
fact,
when
congress
intended
to
create
an
explicit
exception--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--our
view,
your
honor,
as
we
indicated
in
our
reply
brief,
is
it
would
not
because
we
believe
(b)(12)'s
consent
requirement
governs
commercial
bulk
use
of
dmv
information,
which
is
clear
from
the
fact
that
it's
focusing
on
marketing
and
solicitation,
and
also
from
the
history
behind
the
statute,
which
is
very
much
aimed
at
use
of
dmv
information--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--yes
it
does,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
we
think,
justice
sotomayor,
that
this
statute
is
sensibly
construed
to,
under
the
noscitur
a
sociis
principle
that
we
are
relying
on
elsewhere
in
our
argument
with
respect
to
(b)(4).
but
that
same
principle
applies
to
the
three
things
that
the
bulk
solicitation
--
the
bulk
use
provision
governs,
and
particularly
when
you
look
at
the
history
underlying
the
statute
which
was
very
much
aimed
at
use
of
the
information
for
direct
marketing.
and
so,
as
i
was
saying,
congress
made
clear--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
what
your
first
question
--
your
first
example
sounded
like
it
was
a
noncommercial
use.
i
think
that
in
the
case
where
the
state
is
acting
as
a
commercial
entity,
the
same
rules
we
would
--
we
would
apply
with
respect
to
lawyer
solicitation
would
apply
there.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
and
the
reason
i
think
it's
so
clear
that
congress
intended
that
really
lies
in
the
language
of
subsection
(b)(2),
because
there
congress
made
clear
that
it
understood
that
these
provisions
are
not
wholly
independent
permissions
and
in
fact
that
the
consent
requirement
governs
all
commercial
bulk
use
absent
an
explicit
exception.
if
you
take
a
look,
it's
in
the
second
page
of
the
addendum
to
our
opening
brief,
and
it
says
that
"personal
information
may
be
used
in
connection
with
matters
of
motor
vehicle
market
research
activity,
including
survey
research.
"
congress
included
the
survey
research
clause
because
a
commercial
bulk
survey
using
personal
information
would
otherwise
be
governed
by
(b)(12)'s
consent
requirement
and
so
congress
had
to
make
clear
that
it
was
creating
an
exception
for
one
industry
to
engage
in
this
one
particular
type
of
bulk
use.
and
the
reason
we
know
that
the
survey
research
clause
means
that
is
because
under
respondent's
interpretation
it
has
no
affect
whatsoever.
if,
as
they
say,
each
of
these
clauses
is
wholly
independent
and
sufficient
to
authorize
whatever
it
covers,
a
phrase
covering
"in
connection
with
matters
of
motor
vehicle
market
research
activities.
"
would
in
and
of
itself
cover
the
subset
of
motor
vehicle
market
research
survey
research.
so
to
give
that
clause
any
effect
you
must
understand
that
it's
overriding
the
express
consent
requirement
of
(b)(12)
and
--
such
that
you
now
have
to,
when
you
look
at
the
other
provisions
that
might
authorize
bulk
commercial
use,
find
a
comparably
explicit
authorization.
and
you
can't
find
that
in
(b)(4).
(b)(4)
says
nothing
about
solicitation,
much
less
bulk
solicitation.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
but
my
point
is
that
in
(b)(2)
you
find
an
explicit
authorization
for
survey
research,
which
is
one
of
the
very
three
topics
covered
in
(b)(12)
itself.
when
you
look
at
(b)(4),
you
don't
see
anything
about
solicitation,
which
is
the
kind
of
explicit
override
that
(b)(2)
indicates
congress
wanted
or
is
necessary
in
order
to
conclude
that
another
subsection
overrides
(b)(12)'s
express
consent
requirement.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
well,
justice
kagan,
with
respect,
number
one,
i
don't
think
you
can
so
readily
dismiss
the
interpretive
import
of
those
three
words,
because
they
don't
have
any
function
other
than
to
override
the
express
consent
requirement
in
(b)(12).
and
if
there
is
no
need
--
if
(b)(12)
doesn't
apply
to
any
other
subsection,
there
is
no
need
to
be
overriding
it
in
(b)(2).
but
we
don't
rely
solely
on
the
force
of
those
three
words.
it's
also
the
case
that
(b)(2)
--
excuse
me,
(b)(12)
is
one
of
the
core
provisions
of
the
statute
in
the
sense
that
it's
aimed
at
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
that
prompted
passage
of
the
act
in
the
first
place,
which
was
dmv's
collecting
information,
then
making
it
available
to
direct
marketers.
and
so
you
are
in
a
situation
where
you've
got
a
core
restriction
aimed
at
a
core
problem
this
act
is
designed
to
resolve,
but
whereas
(b)(4)
is
one
of
the
few
subsections
that
authorize
access
to
the
most
sensitive
information
that
congress
--
excuse
me,
that
dmv
were
collecting.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
mean
by
that
is
that
we
know
it's
core
in
the
sense
that
it's
aimed
at
one
of
the
core
problems
that
congress
was
addressing.
and
(b)(4),
by
contrast,
is
one
of
the
few
provisions
in
which
congress
authorized
access
to
the
most
sensitive
information
dmvs
collect,
such
as
medical
and
disability
status
and
social
security
numbers.
and
we
submit
it's
simply
implausible
to
think
that
a
congress
concerned
with
undue
public/private
access
to
dmv
information
would
in
the
same
statute
grant
lawyers
the
right,
a
unique
right,
to
use
that
highly
sensitive
information
in
order
to
engage
in
bulk
solicitation.
and
in
fact,
the
legislative
record
here
is
devoid
of
any
evidence
that
congress
was
aware
that
lawyers
ever
made
use
of
dmv
information
for
solicitation,
much
less
--
or
that
they
contemplated
it,
much
less
that
congress
made
a
conscious
decision
to
allow
them
to--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--we
do,
your
honor.
and
that
is
because
that
is
not
a
solicitation.
the
last
notice
is
advising
people
who
are
not
aware
that
there
is
pending
litigation
that
could
affect
their
rights.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
your
honor,
yes,
it
would
be
okay
--
well,
let
me
just
say--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--justice
ginsburg,
if
i
may
just
qualify
my
answer,
yes,
if
you
were
investigating
claims
on
behalf
of
a
potential
client.
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
people
can
just
go
down
to
the
dmv
and
answer
questions
of
personal
interests
to
themselves,
or
lawyers
for
that
matter.
but
that
is
an
instance
in
which
you
are
simply
engaging
in
investigation,
assuming
that
you
are
investigating
a
possible
lawsuit,
and
not
a
circumstance
in
which
you
are
engaging
in
solicitation,
and
that
is
the
fundamental
difference.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
your
honor,
justice
kennedy,
if
they
had
limited
their
activities
to
conducting
an
investigation
to
determine
the
scope
of
a
potential
claim,
we
would
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
no,
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
think
the
point
of
(b)(4)
is
it's
focused
on
proceedings,
not
on
lawyers,
and
it's
asking
--
its
basic
goal
is
to
ensure
that
tribunals
can
do
their
job.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
they
would,
and
i
think
they
do
make
that
argument,
justice
kennedy.
my
point
is
that
the
focus
of
(b)(4)
is
on
the
tribunals
in
ensuring
they
can
have
the
information
that
they
can
do
their
job,
which
is
to
make
and
enforce
judgments.
lawyers
get
information
under
(b)(4)
when
they
act
as
officers
of
these
tribunals,
not
for
their
own
commercial
benefit.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
it
comes
from
the
phrase
"for
use
in
connection
with
any
civil,
criminal,
administrative
or
arbitral
proceeding
in
any
federal,
state
or
local
court
or
agency.
"
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
right.
my
point
is
that
lawyers
get
access
when
they
act
as
officers
of
those
tribunals,
not
for
their
own
commercial
self-interests.
and
an
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
is
an
obligation
that
all
lawyers
have
to
ensure
they
have
a
well-founded
factual
basis
for
bringing
a
lawsuit
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
because,
justice
kennedy,
the
dm
--
the
dppa
is
designed
to
--
it
was
aiming
at
a
fundamental
problem
of
private
individuals
obtaining
the
dmv
information
for
commercial
solicitation
purposes.
and
congress,
we
know,
wanted
to
stop
that
within
the
absence
of
consent.
so
--
by
the
same
token,
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
they
weren't
intruding
on
the
information
that
courts
and
other
tribunals
need
to
do
their
jobs.
and
so
the
distinction
is,
you
can
engage
in
an
investigation
because
that's
acting
as
an
officer
of
the
court
in
order
to
help
the
court
ultimately
render
its
judgment.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
ginsburg,
i
apologize
if
i
am
not
making
myself
clear
enough.
the
vital
distinction
is
between
investigative
activity
to
ensure
that
you
have
a
well-founded
basis
to
file
a
lawsuit,
versus
solicitation--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--justice
ginsburg,
determining
that
there
are
--
there
are
enough
plaintiffs
to
justify
a
class
or
group
action
is
the
investigative
activity,
but
when
you
go
on
to
invite
them
--
and
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
that
these
letters
were
solicitations,
and
that
ruling
is
not
before
this
court--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--justice
ginsburg
--
i'm
sorry,
to
interrupt,
but
something
distracted
my
--
i
couldn't
hear
the
beginning
of
your
question.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
if
the
lawyer
answers
by
asking
investigative
questions,
when
did
you
buy
the
car,
were
you
charged
these
fees,
were
you
advised,
were
they
prominently
displayed,
all
of
which
is
in
gathering
information
for
the
lawsuit.
and
the
lawyer
is
engaging
in
permissible
investigative
prefiling
activity--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--it
still
is,
your
honor.
the
critical
line--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--if
you
were
interested
in
participating
as
--
in
this
proceeding.
and--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--because
class
notice
is
not
a
proposal
of
a
relation
--
a
commercial
transaction.
it
is
noticed--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--correct.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
but
the
function
of
class
notice
is
not
to
enable
class
lawyers
to
solicit
clients.
it
is
to
enable
courts
to
render
binding
judgments
and
to
satisfy
due
process
requirements
so
that
people
unaware
of
a
litigation
do
not
have
their
rights
forfeited.
that
is
fundamentally
different
than
soliciting
clients.
and
i
realize
that--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--your
honor,
i
think
the
point
here
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
conduct
that
is
specified
in
the
three
examples,
it
is
all
activity
that
lawyers
would
be
engaging
in
as
officers
of
a
court,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
lawyers
acting
in
their
own
commercial
capacities
as
opposed
to
officers
of
a
court.
and--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--because
they're
discharging
their
responsibility
to
ensure
that
they
bring
well-founded
claims
and
don't
file
suits
--
i
mean,
under
rule
11,
you
have
to
have
a
well-founded
factual
basis
for
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
so
you
need
to--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--mr.
chief
justice,
with
respect--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--i
think
most
times
when
you
are
in
--
engaging
in
litigation
or
pre-filing
an
investigation,
that
would
be
true,
and
that
would
be
all
protected
under
(b)(4).
the
difference
is
--
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
distinction.
this
court
has
recognized
that
lawyers
have
multiple
capacities.
they
wear
three
hats.
they
are
--
they
represent
clients,
they're
officers
of
courts,
and
they're
commercial
actors--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--well,
justice
kagan,
for
one
thing,
i
think
that
even
if
you
decide
that
(b)(12)
is
not
governing
(b)(4),
it's
still
part
of
the
statute,
and
it
still
demonstrates
that
congress
was
concerned
about
people
using
dmv
information
in
order
to
engage
in
commercial
activity.
so
the
question
then
is
here's
(b)(4),
which
says,
we're
authorizing
use
of
information
for
use
in
tribunals.
there's
no
mention
of
lawyers
here.
and
so
the
question
is
--
and
this
provision
authorizes
use
of
the
most
sensitive
information
that
dmvs
collect.
so
the
question
you
have
to
ask
yourself
is,
in
light
of
(b)(12)
and
the
fact
that
we
know
congress
was
trying
to
stop
use
of
dmv
information
for
non-consensual
solicitations,
is
it
reasonable
to
think
that
this
clause
authorizes
lawyers
to
use
disability
status
and
medical
information
in
order
to
go
find
and
solicit
clients.
and
i
submit
it
is
not,
particularly
if
you
take
the
same
broad
reading
that
respondents
argue
for,
the
in
connection
with
language,
and
you
apply
that
to
(b)(6)
and
(b)(10),
then
you
have
these
truly
incongruous
results,
where
this
court
in
condon
recognized
that
insurers
were
one
of
the
purchasers
of
the
information
that
dmvs
were
selling
and
using
it
to
direct
market,
and
yet
in
connection
with
underwriting,
we've
demonstrated
that
would
mean
that
that
is
an
activity
in
connection
with
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
kennedy--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--i
guess
i've
never
understood
that
--
after
service
of
process,
it's
still
in
anticipation
of
litigation.
it's
been
my
understanding
that
service
of
process--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--i
am
not
disputing
that,
justice
ginsburg.
my
point
is,
though,
even
the
(b)(6)
and
(b)(10)
examples
i
just
gave,
justice
kennedy,
don't
--
it's
not
a
reliance
on
(b)(12)
anymore,
it's
just
demonstrating
why
it's
implausible
to
think
that
the
phrase
in
connection
with
should
be
read
so
literally
that
it
authorizes
anything
that
can
be
shown
to
have
a
connection
with
the
subject
matter.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
sotomayor,
that's
true
in
this
case,
but
if
you
read
before,
the
way
respondents
are
asking
you
to
read
it,
there's
no
limitation
in
the
statute
that
says--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--if
you
interpret
(b)(4)
to
authorize
access
to
lawyers
in
connection
--
based
on
the
theory
that
it's
in
connection
with
some
litigation,
they
will
have
access--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--the
request
in
this
case
simply
said
pursuant
to
(b)(4)
of
the
statute.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
sotomayor,
two
points.
the
request
that
followed
after
the
first
two
said
nothing
of
the
sort,
and
the
state
gave
me
information.
it
just
said
pursuant
to
the
subsection
that
we're
talking
about
right
now.
in
addition,
there
is
no
reason
why
lawyers
couldn't
go
in
and
say:
i
would
like
to
identify
--
i
am
investigating
whether
people
have
claims
for
a
disability
claims
or
based
on
their
medical
status,
and
i
would
like
information
of
that
ilk
from
the
dmv.
(b)(4)
authorizes
the
provision
of
that
information.
and
it
doesn't
say
that
there
has
to
be
some
heightened
showing
by
--
by
the
lawyers
in
order
to
obtain
it.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
two
points,
justice
kagan.
the
first
is
that
you
have
highlighted
why
this
is
such
a
unique
loophole
for
one
very
discreet
class
of
lawyers.
most
--
toxic
tort
lawyers
cannot
go
to
a
dmv
and
say:
i
need
the
names
and
address
of
people.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
i
do.
i
do
acknowledge
that.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
and
i
think
that
that's
an
improper
use.
the
congress
did
not
create
this
authorization
to
go
down
to
get
the
most
sensitive
information
in
order
to
enable
lawyers
to
find
clients
more
easily
than
they
might
otherwise
find
them.
and
so
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
is
one
use
that
congress
authorized
and,
as
i
have
suggested,
it's
a
use
that
helps
a
lawyer
discharge
his
or
her
responsibility
to
a
court.
asking
somebody--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--you
can
ask
every
question
up
to,
would
you
like
to
be
a
plaintiff
in
the
lawsuit,
and
that
would
be
fine.
that's
the
dividing
line.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
that
might
trigger
an
obligation
to
make
a
disclosure
is
not
dispositive
of
whether
it's
a
solicitation.
it
would
still
be
an
objective
factual
inquiry.
and
if
there
were
no
indications
in
the
letter
that
someone
is
being
invited
to
join
a
lawsuit,
then
it
would
be
permissible
investigation.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
though,
in
terms
of
why
they
needed
this
information.
these
lawyers
filed
suits
initially
against
dozens
and
later
against
hundreds
of
defendants
where
they
had
no
client
with
any
claim
against
that
defendant.
then
they
went
to
the
dmv
and
they
found
over
30,000
names
and
addresses
and
sent
out
what
the
fourth
circuit
determined
were
solicitations
in
order
to
get
clients
in
the
claims
they
already
improperly
asserted.
they
did
not
need
that
information
to
indicate
the
interest
of
the
named
plaintiffs
they
already
had.
those
people
had
standing
to
sue--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--but
their
--
their
clients
have
no
interest
or
need
to
reach
those
other
dealerships.
they
have
a
claim
against
the
dealers
with
whom
they
dealt--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
and
the
south
carolina
state
court
said
that
each
named
individual
could
sue
for
the
benefit
of
everyone
who
dealt
with
the
same
dealer
that
that
plaintiff
dealt
with.
so
there
is
no
inconsistency.
and,
of
course,
even
if
they
want
to
try
to
affect
the
conduct
of
the
dealerships
with
whom
their
clients
never
dealt
with,
they
could
still
get
declaratory
relief.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
thank
you.
first
of
all,
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
the
consequence
of
respondent's
argument
is
that
--
is
they
gave
the
example
of
going
to
get
the
license
plate
and
then
getting
the
name
and
address
to
serve
process.
but
on
their
theory,
you
can
also
go
down
and
--
you
can
witness
an
accident
on
the
side
of
the
road,
you
can
go
down
to
dmv,
get
the
name
and
license
--
use
the
license
plate
to
get
the
name
and
address
and
send
a
solicitation
letter.
and
that
is
trolling.
and
i
think
everybody
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
line
seems
to
be
everybody
wants
it
somewhere
south
of
trolling
and
yet--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--my
line
--
my
line--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--our
line
is
solicitation,
justice
breyer,
and
there
are
two
ways
to
get
that.
there
is
the
--
we
--
i
submit
is
the
strong
textual
evidence
in
(b)(2),
that
congress
did
in
fact
understand
that
the
consent
requirement
governs
all
bulk
solicitation
or
surveys
or
marketing
and
it
had
to
give
an
explicit
override
in
(b)(2),
because
otherwise
(b)(12)
would
have
restricted
the
ability
to
do
nonconsent--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
are
you
talking
about--
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
--for
purposes
of
soliciting
new
class
representatives,
i
think
not.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
and
i
think
--
and
there
are
loads
of
ways
to
find
class
representatives
without
going
to
dmvs.
and,
in
fact,
that's
what
most
class
action
lawyers
have
to
do
is
advertise
in
one
fashion
or
another.
so
that's
not,
to
my
mind,
in
congress's
conclusion.
but
i
would
just
point
out
that
according
to
respondents,
the
phrase
survey
research
is
surplusage,
and
this
court
says
that's
--
you're
not
supposed
to
reach
that
conclusion
if
you
can
avoid
it
and
you
can
avoid
it
by
understanding
it
to
be
the
meaning
--
the
meaning
--
its
effect
is
to
override
the
consent
requirement
so
that
you
can
do
commercial
bulk
surveys
in
(b)(2),
which
would
otherwise
require
consent
as
a
consequence
of
(b)(12).
and
then
there
is
the
so-called
junior
varsity
harmonization
basis
for
reaching
solicitation.
and
i
would
point
out
that
respondents
are
saying,
it
can't
be
that
some
--
certain
statements
in
a
letter
means
you
crossed
the
line
into
solicitation.
now,
that
has
all
kinds
of
massive
civil
liability
consequences.
congress
used
the
word
l
solicitation
in
this
statute.
congress
meant
to
draw
some
kind
of
line
around
solicitation.
now,
admittedly,
we're
saying
that
the
harmonization
means
that
that's
the
same
line
you
would
draw
in
(b)(4).
but
it's
not
inconceivable
to
think
that
congress
was
--
was
drawing
a
line
at
solicitation
and
that
liability
would
flow
depending
upon
whether
somebody
crossed
it
or
not.
mr.
joseph
r.
guerra
your
honor,
our
point
is,
sort
of
if
you
step
back,
and
this
is
the
question
for
the
harmonization
purpose.
(b)(4)
covers
solicitation
only
because
of
the
indeterminacy
of
the
phrase
in
connection
with.
without
that
language,
there's
no
basis
for
saying
(b)(4)
is
authorizing
lawyers'
solicitations.
so
it
is,
i
would
submit,
at
the
periphery
of
the
authorization
that
(b)(4)
provides.
(b)(12)
solicitation
is
at
the
core
of
what
that
provision
is
about
and
that
--
the
--
the
mass
marketing
of
using
dmv
information
is
one
of
the
fundamental
problems
congress
was
addressing.
and
i
just
think
it's
implausible
to
conclude
that
the
--
that
the
periphery
concept
in
(b)(4)
should
take
precedence
over
the
core
function
of
(b)(12).
