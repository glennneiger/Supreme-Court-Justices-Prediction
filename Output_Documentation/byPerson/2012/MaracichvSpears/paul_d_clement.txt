mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
dppa
is
an
unusual
statute.
it
directly
regulates
the
state's
use
of
their
own
databases
and
imposes
massive
civil
liability
and
criminal
penalties
for
violations.
it
regulates
it
in
a
relatively
distinct
way,
which
is
it
makes
disclosures
presumptively
unlawful,
but
then
has
14
permissible
use
provisions
for
which
the
state
may,
not
must,
but
may
disclose
the
information.
the
scope
of
those
14
permissible
use
provisions
then
becomes
quite
important
for
determining
whether
or
not
a
statute
that
was
originally
designed
primarily
to
regulate
the
commercial
sale
of
dmv
information
becomes
intrusive
into
matters
of
traditional
state
regulation
or
imposes
massive
liability
without
the
requisite
clarity.
now,
i
would
have
thought
that
it
was
fairly
clear
that,
but
for
a
resort
to
the
specific
controls
the
general
canon,
that
all
of
the
activity
at
issue
here
comes
comfortably
within
the
language
of
(b)(4),
because
if
you
look
at
that
language,
it
is
remarkably
broad.
congress
uses
the
word
any
three
times.
it
uses
in
connection
with,
which
i
think
we
all
know
is
a
term
of
breadth.
and
then
it
uses
including
and
uses
illustrative
examples.
and
i
think
the
only
thing
that
really
brings
these
examples
together
is
congress
seems
to
be
covering
the
litigation
process
from
cradle
to
grave.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
exactly
right.
but
the
whole
reason
you
have
to
have
some
limit
is
because
it's
presumptively
quite
broad.
and
if
--
i
mean,
for
those
who
look
at
legislative
history,
the
evolution
of
this
provision,
it
was
changed
twice
in
the
legislative
process.
and
it
started
out
that
congress
was
going
to
have
a
permissible
use
just
for
use
in
litigation
involving
motor
vehicles.
then
they
dropped
motor
vehicles
and
just
said
use
in
litigation.
and
then
in
the
final
iteration,
they
said
use
in
connection
with
litigation.
so
clearly
they
were
trying
to
broaden
it.
now,
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
there
has
to
be
some
limit,
and
we
certainly
wouldn't
say,
for
example,
that
if
lawyers,
you
know,
decide
in
this
case,
well,
you
know,
we
got
this
dmv
information
for
perfectly
legitimate
purposes
involved
in
a
litigation,
but
now
we
are
sitting
on
a
gold
mine,
so
we
should
try
to
sell
these
same
people
floor
mats
or
wiper
blades
or
something.
i
mean,
of
course
they
can't
do
that.
so
there
are
limits.
but
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
may
or
may
not
depending
on
where
you
draw
the
line.
but
can
i
say
something
before
we
talk
about
that?
you
know,
if
they
are
really
trying
to
go
after
the
dress
manufacturers--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
can
go
to
the
phone
book,
they
can
go
to
the
title
records
office,
there
is
lots
of
places
they
can
go
if
what
they
want
is
just
general
information
about
people.
and
the
only
state
database
that
congress
has
seen
fit
to
regulate
is
dmv
databases.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but,
justice
breyer,
that's
part
of
the
reason
i'm
pointing--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
actually
the
best
answer
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
it
depends
on
whether
you
are
focused
on
a
specific
transaction,
occurrence,
defect.
so
i
think
you
might
ultimately--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
say
the
best
answer
is
that
you
can.
if
you
don't
like
that
answer
and
you
want
to
draw
the
line
in
a
different
place--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
here's
the
thing.
i
think
there
is
a
couple
of
places
you
could
draw
the
line,
and
i
think
there
is
a
line
drawing
question
any
time
you
have
language
like
in
connection
with.
the
first
would
be,
okay,
i'm
lawyers
and
i
want
to
get
clients
for
litigation.
you
could
say,
well,
that's
enough
of
an
in
connection
requirement
so
you
can
use
that.
i
would
say
that
that's
probably
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
but
you
could
just
say
that's
close
enough.
the
other
place
you
could
draw
the
line
is
when
you
have
a
specific
transaction,
occurrence,
defect,
so
that
there
be
would
be
a
difference.
if
i
get
this
information
and
send
people
letters
and
say,
i
see
you
bought
a
new
car
in
the
last
two
years.
you
know,
there
is
a
lemon
law
in
this
state--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
they
are
not
in
the
following
sense,
justice
breyer.
okay.
just
to
understand
kind
of
the
chronology
here.
no
request
--
foia
request
is
made
at
all
here
until
my
clients
have
been
approached
by
individuals
who
are
complaining,
okay?
no
letter
goes
out
until
the
litigation
is
actually
filed.
now,
they
want
to
say--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
if
you
want
to
draw
the
line
south
of
the
trolling
line,
then
i
think
what
you
would
say
is
this
is
an
easy
case
because
no
communication
took
place
until
my
clients
had
a
client.
and
they
want
to
say,
wait
a
second,
your
clients
didn't
have
a
beef
with
the
other
dealers.
that's
wrong.
at
all
times
in
this
suit
they
had
a
conspiracy
claim
against
those
other
dealers.
so
even
as
to
the
individuals
they
already
represented,
they
had
a
beef
with
those
dealers.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
a
foia
request
was
made
before
the
suit
was
filed.
no
letter
to
a
potential
witness/client
was
sent
until
after
it
was
filed.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
and
the
foia
--
the
two
foia
requests
that
were
made
beforehand
were
specifically
noted
that
they
were
in
anticipation
of
litigation
and
they
were
investigating,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggested,
as
they
needed
to
under
state
law,
whether
this
was
a
widespread
practice.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
it
would,
justice
ginsburg,
because
i
think
that
when
you
are
trying
to
figure
out
where
to
draw
the
line
you
look
to
the
words
in
the
statute
which
you
know
that
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
is
covered.
and
i
would
think
that
would
fit
comfortably
within
investigation
of
anticipation
of
litigation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
couldn't
agree
more,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
is
why
the
line
can't
really
be
between
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
and
solicitation
in
anticipation
of
litigation.
because
that
is
too
thin
a
line
to
make
a
$200
million
difference.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
the
line
is
whether
or
not
it
is
in
anticipation
of
litigation
or
in
connection
with
litigation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
the
way
you
do
is
you
would
basically
say
that
when
they
are
saying
in
anticipation
of
litigation
they
mean
in
anticipation
of
a
particular
litigation,
particular
problem,
and
so
it's
different--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--oh,
absolutely
not.
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
are
concerned
about
a
particular
thing,
and
i
think
the
in
anticipation
of
litigation
language,
i
mean,
that's
not
the
only
time
you
have
ever
seen
it
before--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
it
is,
though
i
guess
my
point
would
be
even
if
you
can
identify
some
solicitation
that
is
not
investigation,
as
long
as
it's
in
connection
with
litigation
it's
in
(b)(4),
and
then
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
agree
with
everything
except
the
first
thing
you
said
which
is
that
this
is
a
prohibition
on
solicitation.
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
it
says
presumptively
you
can't
use
this
for
anything,
and
then
there
are
14
permissions.
and
some
of
the
permissions,
like
(b)(4),
are
unconditional.
if
you
come
within
(b)(4),
you
get
to
use
it.
now,
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
statute,
which
i
respectfully
suggest
is
not
where
you
put
the
core
provisions,
it's
where
you
put
the
less
favored
provisions,
then
you
have
in
(b)(12)
a
conditional
permission
that
you
can
use
it
but
only
if
you
get
consent.
now,
the
thrust
of
their
position
is
if
you
are
in
one
of
the
unconditional
permissions,
but
you
also
are
presumptively
in
one
of
the
conditional
permissions,
somehow
that
condition
from
(b)(12)
hops
over
to
(b)(12)
--
(b)(4)
and
says--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
you
don't.
there
is
no
discrepancy.
a
conditional
--
like
you
get
a
green
light
for
use
in
litigation.
you
get
a
yellow
light
for
solicitation.
if
you
have
solicitation
in
connection
with
litigation,
you're
covered
by
both,
you
take
the
green
light,
there
is
no
conflict.
and
the
premise
for
your
discussion
was
we
have
to
harmonize.
i
would
take
issue
with
that.
if
you
look
at
these
14
exceptions,
there
is
tons
of
overlap
in
them.
congress
is
not
telling
you
that
each
of
these
14
exceptions
is
an
exclusive
area
and
you
have
to
find
out
which
field
is
preempted
by
(1),
(2),
(3),
(4),
(5),
(6),
(7).
if
you
look
at
(b)(1)
and
(b)(4),
there
is
complete
overlap.
one
of
the
things
i
would
take
issue
with
is
my
brother
said
that
well,
(b)(4)
is
about
the
tribunal.
no,
it's
not.
(b)(1)
is
principally
about
the
tribunal.
(b)(1)
is
the
provision
that
talks
about
government
actors
and
their
functions,
and
it
specifically
talks
about
torts.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
alito,
it
is
important
to
recognize
lawyers
presumptively
get
it
under
federal
law,
but
federal
law
is
only
a
floor.
and
so
let's
take
social
security
numbers,
please,
because,
sure,
as
to
(b)(4)
and
(b)(1)
and
two
other
provisions
congress
says
presumptively,
you
can
get
social
security
numbers.
you
know
what
the
state
of
north
carolina
says?
you
never
get
social
security
numbers
unless
you
have
a
court
order.
they
put
that
right
in
their
state
foia
law.
so
that
is
just
another
example
of
how
--
this
is
a
federal
floor.
states
can
release
this
information.
they
don't
have
to.
and
to
justice
breyer's
point,
it
makes
sense
that
you
would
distinguish
between
an
attorney
who
is
subject
to
the
bar
discipline,
is
subject
to
oversight
and
solicitation
process,
and
treat
that
solicitation
differently
from
a
solicitation
by
a
direct
marketer,
which
is
what
(b)(12)
is
clearly
aimed
at,
not
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it's
certainly
not
an
all-purpose
privacy
statute.
i
do
think
that's
fair.
the
principal
thing
they
were
concerned
about,
of
course,
is
that
you
could
look
at
somebody's
license
plate
and
indiscriminately
go
down,
pay
a
fee,
and
get
their
home
address.
now,
the
one
thing
we
know
from
(b)(4)
is,
if
a
lawyer
wants
to
do
that
exact
thing
to
serve
process,
the
lawyer
gets
to
do
it.
you
can
get
somebody's
license
plate,
go
to
the
dmv,
get
an
address
and
serve
process.
they
specifically
preserve
that.
so
we
know
as
to
the
core
of
the
statute
they
treated
lawyers
differently.
they
were
also
concerned
with
direct
marketers
taking
this
information
and
using
it
to
market
people.
but
i
don't
think
you'd
lump
lawyer
solicitation
in
anticipation
of
litigation,
which
may
put
some
limit
on
it,
together
with
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there's
two
problems
with
that
way
of
looking
at
the
statute,
i
think
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
justice
kennedy.
one
is,
we
are
talking
about
items
on
an
inclusive
list,
so
even
if
you
took
your
premise
that
the
anticipation
of
litigation
in
that
list
somehow
is
anticipation
post
service
of
process,
which
i
want
to
come
back
to,
even
if
you
took
that
position,
they
are
just
things
on
an
inclusive
list,
and
so
it
wouldn't
stop
you
from
saying
that
the
ultimate
test
here
is
whether
it's
in
connection
with
litigation.
but
i
guess
i
would
go
back
to
that
and
say
i've
never
once
thought
that
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
was
something
that
would
take
place
after
service
of
process.
i
thought
--
i
mean--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
was
an
intentional
thing
on
the
court's
part,
that
we're
going
to
name
these
and
we're
going
to
name
them
in
chronological
order.
if
they
tried
to
do
it,
i
think
they
got
it
wrong.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
last
word
conflicting?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
they
are
necessarily
overlapping.
and
i
guess
i
would
point
to
several
things.
first
of
all,
the
language
in
(b)(2)
i
don't
think
helps
them
nearly
as
much
as
they
do.
i
think
that
language
in
there
about
survey
research,
like
much
language
in
many
statutes,
maybe
avoids
the
marketers
or
--
the
motor
vehicle
marketers
from
having
to
be
here
in
a
lawsuit,
because
it
removes
all
doubt
about
it.
but
i
think
they
would
be
covered
even
without
those
words.
but
the
point
is,
you
may
say,
well,
that's
horrible,
that's
superfluous.
but
no;
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
statute
operates
generally,
there's
lots
of
overlap.
so
this
isn't
a
context
where
you
want
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
overlap
and
everyone
operates
independently.
i
pointed
to
(b)(1)
and
(b)(4).
they
both
cover
courts
and
litigation.
if
this
court
uses
dmv
information
in
its
opinion,
it's
covered
by
(b)(1),
it's
covered
by
(b)(4).
or
look
at
(b)(3).
(b)(3)
is
a
provision
that
says
generally
companies
can
use
dmv
information
to
verify
somebody's
identity.
and
then
it
specifically
says:
and
if
somebody
lies
to
you
about
their
identity,
you
can
pursue
legal
remedies.
okay,
when
you're
pursuing
that
legal
remedy
pursuant
to
(b)(3),
you're
also
doing
things
in
connection
with
litigation
pursuant
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
as
we've
discussed,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
are
saying
you
are
not
going
to
apply
the
specific
controls
the
general,
but
you
may
be
using
a
junior
varsity
version
of
it
to
harmonize
the
statute--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--as
we
suggested
in
our
colloquy,
i
think
the
line
between
solicitation
in
anticipation
of
investigation
and
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
is
far
too
thin
a
line
to
make
a
$200
million
difference.
and
if
i
could
direct
the
court
to
page
93
of
the
joint
appendix,
because
that
will
show
you
just
an
example
of
the
postcard
that
is
attached
to
these
letters.
and
the
postcard
does
ask
specifically,
as
justice
ginsburg
was
suggesting
--
again,
this
is
at
93
of
the
joint
appendix
--
it
asks
people
to
fill
out
their
name,
address,
the
dealership
they
bought
the
car
from,
the
type
of
car,
and
then
the
administrative
fee
or
processing
fee
that
was
charged.
now,
i
think
it's
common
ground
between
the
parties
that
we
get
to
ask
about
that
administrative
or
processing
fee
because
that
is
investigation
in
anticipation
of
the
litigation.
as
i
understand
where
my
clients
arguably
made
a
$200
million
mistake
is
by
adding
the
line
i'm
interested
--
i
am
interested
in
participating
signature.
that
crosses
the
line
into
solicitation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
not
under
south
carolina
law.
it
absolutely
couldn't.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
but,
justice
breyer,
let
me
try
to
help
you
this
way,
which,
is
first
of
all,
every
state
in
the
country
is
focused
on
identity
theft.
and
the
only
circumstances
in
which
i
could
ever
imagine
a
state
giving
social
security
numbers
to
a
lawyer
is
if
there
case
was,
you
know,
these
car
dealers
are
putting
the
social
security
numbers
on
the
forms
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
know
that
offhand.
i
can
get
that
to
you
in
a
supplemental
letter.
i
just
know
south
carolina
says
right
in
their
foia
statute
you
can't
get
that
information.
and
like
i
said,
the
only
situation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--what's
that?
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
and
it
may
be
--
it
may
be
lawyers
--
it
may
be
the
lawyers
want
to
enforce
that
federal
law
against
the
dealers,
and
in
enforcing
that
federal
law
against
the
dealers
they
might
ask
for
the
information.
it's
the
same
kind
of
thing.
the
only
circumstances
in
which
i
could
imagine
a
state
would
ever
give
a
lawyer
disability
information
is
if
they
were
bringing
an
ada
suit.
if
they
were
bringing
an
ada
suit
against
a
dealer,
you
might--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--fair
point.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
sure.
but
they
can
solicit
for
their
legal
services
in
connection
with
litigation.
and
that
i
think
is
different--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
again,
if
you're
going
to
draw
a
line
--
there's
two
things
here.
there's
an
impulse
to
draw
a
line
with
in
connection
with,
and
at
some
point
you
will
have
to.
but
i
don't
think
solicitation
provides
the
line.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
sure.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yeah.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
right,
justice
kagan.
and
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
my
--
my
clients
fall
on
the
other
side
of
even
yet
another
line,
which
is
they
already
had
clients
before
they
asked
dmv
anything.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
or
to
put
--
to
give
just
another
sort
of
example,
this
seems
to
be
what
clearly
surely
should
be
covered
is,
okay,
i
understand
there's
a
defect
with
the
particular
make
and
model
of
a
car.
i've
used
the
dmv
records
consistent
with
state
law
to
get
access
to
the
fact
that
you've
bought
one
of
these
cars,
do
you
want
to
join
the
suit?
i
don't
think
there's
anything
nefarious
with
that.
there's
certainly
nothing--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yeah,
that's
--
that's
not
my
case,
because
these
people
came
to
us
before
we
did
anything.
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
that,
your
honor.
and
yes,
you
might
say
it's
solicitation,
but
i
don't
think
if
you
look
at
these
provisions,
that
you
would
interpret
them
that
way
when
they're
all
permissive
uses.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
alito,
i
think
when
it
uses
in
anticipation
of
litigation,
it
actually
wants
to
cover
activity
that
takes
place
before
there's
an
actual
proceeding.
and
what
i
was
going
to
say
is,
you
know,
that
language
doesn't
come
out
of
ether.
i
mean,
that's
the
language
you
use
in
attorney
work
product.
and
as
i
understand
it,
i've
looked
into
this
a
little
bit,
the
basic
rule
there
is
you
distinguish
between
litigation
in
the
abstract
and
the
point
at
which
you've
identified
a
particular
transaction,
occurrence,
defect
and
at
that
point,
if
you're
doing
something,
it's
in
--
it's
in
anticipation
of
litigation.
the
one
other
point
i
haven't
yet
made,
which
is
to
the
extent
you're
going
to
resort
to
the
specific
controls
of
the
general,
i
think
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
would
be
the
first
time
that
i'm
aware
of
that
the
court
would
ever
have
applied
that
canon
to
impose
this
kind
of
massive
civil
liability
and
even
potentially
criminal
liability.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
agree.
and
i
think
that's
the
best
reason
why
the
canon
doesn't
work.
these
are
equally
specific,
and
in
the
case
of
an
overlap
between
the
two
that
you
have
here
and
you
have
in
(b)(1)
and
(b)(4)
and
(b)(3)
and
(b)(4),
you
just
say,
okay,
congress
thought
it
was
okay
and
you
just
call
it
a
day.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
paradoxically.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yeah.
and
the
reason
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
but
the
line-drawing
problem
is
really
drawing
the
line
about
in
connection
with.
the
line-drawing
problem
--
drawing
the
line
between
solicitation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
and
investigation
in
--
in
anticipation
of
litigation
just
doesn't
work,
they're
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
if
my
clients
had
sent
a
letter
that
nobody
objects
to
that
says,
we're
bringing
a
lawsuit,
we
think
you
may
have
been
charged
the
same
kind
of
fee,
i
think
what
the
state
bar
would
have
said,
the
natural
next
question
for
anybody
getting
that
letter
is,
will
you
represent
me
and
precisely
because
of
that,
we
want
you
--
we
want
to
treat
this
like
it's
solicitation
and
we
want
to
add
these
additional
bells
and
whistles.
and
part
of
the
irony
here
is
i
think
the
things
that
make
our
letter
look
most
like
it's
advertisement
or
solicitation
are
the
things
that
are
required
by
the
state
bar.
and
keep
in
mind,
that's
another
reason
why
treating
attorney
solicitation
differently
from
general
solicitation
makes
perfect
sense,
because
they're
subject
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
and
--
they
would
--
it's
so
natural
that
somebody
will
say,
can
i
join
your
lawsuit--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
they
would
require
all
the
language
that
says,
you
have
alternatives,
other
people
can
--
can
--
can
hire
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
justice
scalia,
the
last
thing
you
can
infer
from
the
statute
that
congress
wanted,
for
the
first
time
ever,
get
in
the
business
of
managing
attorney
solicitation,
a
subject
they'd
always
left
to
the
states.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--my
--
my
preferred
reading
is
that
transaction,
occurrence,
defect,
which
i
took
her
red
light
camera
to
be
an
example
of
a
particular
identified
defect.
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
before
i
sit
down,
it's
the
last
thing
i'll
emphasize,
that
my
case
is
a
little
bit
better,
because
we
had
a
client
and
a
specific
defect
before
anything
happened.
