justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
aren't
we
going
to
be
told
the
whole
essence
of
the
class
action
is
you
have
to
see
if
there
is
an
injury
that
goes
beyond
some
particular
clients
that
you
know.
and
isn't
this
--
isn't
this
investigation
in
anticipation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
anticipation
is,
are
you
willing
to
join
the
class?
isn't
that
critical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
do
think
you
are
helped
somewhat
by
the
chronological
progression
here,
including
the
service
of
process,
which
means
the
case
has
already
started,
and
then
investigation
in
anticipation
of
the
litigation
that
follows
the
service
of
process.
so
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
chronological
aspect.
in
order,
it
seems
to
me,
for
the
respondents
to
prevail
they
have
to
say
that
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
also
precedes
service
of
process.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
--
are
you
saying
that
the
study
must
be
either
a
solicitation
or
an
investigation,
it
can't
be
both?
why
can't
it
be
both?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
understand
your
argument
about
(12),
but
i
do
think
that
you
ought
to
assume
we
might
interpret
this
statute
so
that
each
of
these
is
independent,
and
you
have
to
concentrate
on
(4).
you
keep
going
back
to
(12)
when
we're
talking
about
(4).
if
you
talk
about
(4)
for
a
minute,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
might
give
away
too
much,
because
a
statute
says
including
service
of
process,
which
means
the
suit
has
to
begin,
and
then
investigation
in
anticipation
of
the
litigation
that
will
follow
after
the
suit
is
filed.
but
you
seem
to
give
that
away.
you
seem
to
think
that
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
can
be
before
the
suit
is
filed.
you
--
you
seem
to
concede
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
why
you
concede
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
interrupt
for
just
one
moment.
i
may
have
misheard
or
you
may
have
misspoke.
i
thought
you
said
that
no
requests
were
sent
until
the
suit
was
filed
but
the
request
was
--
the
first
foia
request
was
june
23rd,
2005;
the
second
foia
request
was
august
24,
2006;
and
this
herron
suit
was
filed
august
29,
2006.
so
letters
were
sent
before
the
suit
was
filed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
the
foia
suit
was
made
before
the
suit
was
filed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
anticipation
of
litigation
does
come
after
service
of
process,
and
an
additional
way
to
harmonize
this
statute
with
(12)
is
to
say
that
after
the
suit
has
been
filed,
then
in
anticipation
of
the
litigation
that
that
suit
will
engender,
then
you
may
get
the
information.
but
you
didn't
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
way
the
statute's
written.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
because
--
that's
because
the
state
is
allowing
solicitation
and
it
puts
certain
conditions
on
what
your
solicitation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
point
to
page
94,
you
say,
oh,
it's
just
the
last
line,
the
whole
thrust
of
the
letter
was
solicitation,
you
have
to
be
fair
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
have
to
be
fair
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
obtain
a
driver's
license
or
to
register
a
vehicle,
state
department
of
motor
vehicles
has
a
general
rule,
requiring
an
individual
to
disclose
detailed
personal
information.
this
includes
an
individual's
name,
home
address,
and
telephone
number
and
in
many
states,
including
the
state
in
this
case,
it
includes
the
individual's
social
security
number
and
medical
information.
now,
a
federal
statute
has
been
enacted
to
protect
the
privacy
of
drivers
who
furnish
this
information
to
the
state
dmvs
and
the
federal
law,
as
the
diver's
privacy
protect
act
or
the
dppa.
disclosure
of
personal
information
from
the
state
dmv
databases
is
prohibited
under
this
federal
act
unless
that
disclosure
falls
within
one
of
the
act's
exceptions.
the
respondents
here
are
south
carolina
trial
lawyers.
they
obtained
names
and
addresses
of
over
34,000
individuals
from
the
south
carolina
dmv.
they
did
this
to
send
letters
seeking
plaintiffs
for
a
lawsuit
that
they
had
filed
against
a
group
of
south
carolina
auto
dealerships
for
violations
of
state
law.
the
petitioners
here,
who
are
the
plaintiffs
below,
are
south
carolina
residents
whose
information
was
obtained
and
used
without
their
consent.
they
sued
the
respondents,
the
state
trial
lawyers,
for
violating
the
federal
act,
the
dppa.
now,
there
are
14
subsections
in
the
federal
act
that
contained
exceptions
to
the
general
non-disclosure
rule
and
this
case,
requires
the
court
to
interpret
the
exception
that's
contained
in
subsection
b
(4).
and
it
simplifies
a
bit
for
this
summary,
but
the
b
(4)
exception
allows
personal
information
to
be
disclosed
for
use
in
connection
with
any
civil,
administrative
or
arbitral
proceeding
and
the
statute
specifies
that
this
includes
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation.
and
the
respondents,
the
trial
attorneys,
argue
here
that
both
of
these
phrases
or
either
of
them,
cover
their
use
of
dmv
information.
in
light
of
the
text
and
structure
of
the
dppa,
the
court
today
holds
that
an
attorney's
solicitation
of
clients
is
not
permissible
under
either
of
the
phrases
just
noted.
solicitation
is
a
distinct
form
of
conduct,
separate
from
the
limited
permissible
purposes
provided
under
b
(4).
it
is
separate
from
an
attorney's
duties
as
an
officer
of
the
court
or
as
an
agent
of
the
client.
the
distinction
between
solicitation
and
other
litigation
activities
is
recognized
by
state
bars,
and
state
statutes,
that
treat
solicitation
as
a
discrete
subject
for
regulation
and
governess
of
the
legal
profession.
interpreting
b
(4),
not
to
include
solicitation,
is
further
supported
by
the
fact
that
b
(4)
is
one
of
only
four
of
the
14
statutory
exceptions
that
permits
the
use
of
the
most
sensitive
kind
of
information,
including
medical
and
disability
history
and
social
security
numbers,
to
permit
this
highly
personal
information,
to
be
used
in
bulk
solicitation
would
be
so
substantial
and
intrusion
on
privacy
that
it
must
not
be
assumed
without
a
clear
indication
that
congress
intended
to
provide
attorneys
with
a
special
concession
to
gain
access
to
this
information
for
this
purpose.
excluding
solicitation
from
the
reach
of
b
(4)
also
respects
the
statutory
design
of
the
federal
act.
the
use
of
protected
personal
information
for
the
purpose
of
bulk
solicitation
is
addressed
explicitly
by
the
exception
in
b
(12),
and
it
has
the
specific
safeguard
requiring
the
express
consent
of
the
person
contacted.
if
the
in
connection
with
language
of
b
(4)
were
read
broadly
to
include
solicitation
and
attorney
could
use
protected
information
to
send
bulk
solicitations,
to
perspective
clients
without
their
express
consent,
and
this
would
create
tension
or
significant
tension
in
the
dppa
between
the
litigation
and
the
solicitation
exceptions.
now,
the
respondents
contend
that
even
if
b
(4)
does
not
permit
attorneys
to
solicit
as
a
general
matter,
it
should
be
allowed
here
when
tied
to
a
particular
proceeding.
while
some
solicitations
may
have
a
close
relationship
to
the
existing
proceeding,
there
is
no
principled
way
to
classify
some
solicitations
as
acceptable
and
others
as
unacceptable
for
purposes
of
b
(4).
in
determining
whether
obtaining,
using
or
disclosing
the
personal
information
is
for
the
prohibited
purpose
of
solicitation,
the
proper
inquiry
is
whether
the
defendant
had
the
predominant
purpose
to
solicit.
that
purpose
might
be
evident
from
the
communication
itself.
in
other
instances,
the
defendant's
whole
course
of
conduct
will
be
relevant
in
determining
whether
solicitation
was
the
predominant
purpose
of
the
act.
there
is
a
concern
here
about
the
amount
of
damages
sought
in
the
complaint.
recall
that
over,
34,000
individuals
received
communications
from
the
respondents,
under
one
view
of
the
federal
act's
damages
provision
this
would
amount
to
$2500
per
violation
or
sum
in
the
neighborhood
of
$170
million.
whether
the
civil
damages
provision
in
the
act,
section
2724,
whether
that
section,
the
damages
section
after
a
careful
and
proper
interpretation
would
permit
an
award
in
this
amount,
and
if
so,
whether
principles
of
due
process
and
other
doctrines
that
protect
against
excessive
awards
would
come
into
play
is
not
an
issue
argued
or
presented
here.
in
summary,
solicitation
of
perspective
clients
is
not
a
permissible
use
in
connection
with
litigation
or
investigation
and
anticipation
of
litigation
under
b
(4)
of
the
act.
as
a
result,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
granting
respondents
summary
judgment
without
first
determining
whether
the
communications
had
the
predominant
purpose
of
solicitation.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court
must
determine
whether
the
letters
sent
by
the
trial
attorneys,
the
respondents,
viewed
objectively
had
the
predominant
purpose
of
solicitation.
and
in
these
further
proceedings,
other
questions
under
the
statute
can
be
addressed
including
the
argument
that
respondents
conduct
was
permissible
under
the
b
(1)
governmental
function
exception
which
neither
this
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
addressed.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia,
sotomayor,
and
kagan
join.
