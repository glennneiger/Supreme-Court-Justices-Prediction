justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
it
create
an
exception
for
research?
let's
assume
that
a
university
wanted
to
do
a
research
project
and
it
needs
subjects.
i
get
solicited
for
it
all
the
time.
does
this
exception
apply
to
them,
too?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
says
surveys,
not
just
marketing
or
solicitations.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
there
is
a
commercial
component,
but
there
appears
to
be
a
noncommercial
component
as
well.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
apply
to
the
states,
too,
when
they
want
to
market
against
drunk
driving,
they
want
to
market
against
--
for
their
health
insurance
processes,
versus
private
processes
for
state
drug
provided--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
the
lawyer
had
said
more
--
did
you
buy
a
car,
did
you
get
charged
the
fee,
we're
investigating
this
to
determine
whether
this
is
--
violates
the
law.
is
that
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that's
bad
is
to
say,
come
call
us
for
a
consultation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
how
you
answered
justice
ginsburg
when
she
said
class
notice
would
be
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wait
a
minute.
it's
joining
the
class
or
opting
out.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
when
you
join
the
class,
you
have
a
commercial
relationship
with
the
lawyer
no
different
than
being
a
named
plaintiff.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
--
you
said
earlier,
and
it
set
me
to
thinking,
that
why
would
in
anticipation
of
litigation
permit
access
to
all
of
this
very
personal
information?
and
i
don't
know
that,
yes,
it
does
permit
access,
but
only
in
anticipation
of
litigation.
so
you
have
to
prove
before
you
get
things
like
social
security
number,
driver
--
anything
else
--
all
they
asked
for
was
names
and
addresses,
i
understand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
yes,
there
is.
there
is
a
limitation
that
you're
actually
going
to
use
it
in
relationship
to
the
litigation,
number
one.
and
the
states
are
obligated
to
ensure
that
what
they
release
is
actually
covered
by
one
of
these
exceptions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
to
explain
why.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
as
i
read,
the
first
one
is:
we
want
to
see
if
there
is
a
pattern
of
overcharging;
give
us
the
names
and
addresses
of
people
who
have
recently
bought
a
car.
that
seems
to
me
pretty
specific
as
to
what
they
want
and
why
they
need
it.
and
i
think
it's
pretty
easy
for
the
state
to
say
--
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
clement,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
satisfied
with
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
scalia.
he
said:
look,
we've
got
to
harmonize;
instead
of
general-specific,
solicitation
of
clients
is
different
than
investigation,
and
we
just
say
they're
mutually
exclusive.
it
is
a
little
bit
of
a
general
and
specific.
and
that's
proven
by
(b)(2),
because
when
(b)(2)
wants
to
permit
solicitation
it
expressly
says
it
and
they
didn't
expressly
say
solicitation
in
(4).
that's
i
think
your
adversary's
main
argument.
and
i'm
still
not
sure
i'm
comfortable
with
the
answer
you're
giving.
you're
saying
they're
independent,
but
why
are
they
necessarily
conflicting?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
conflicting,
exactly,
or
conflicting
or
overlapping.
i
guess
why
are
they
necessarily
overlapping?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
a
federal
law
to
that
effect?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
may
be
a
federal
law
to
that
effect.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
just
want
to,
before
you
leave,
because
in
response
to
justice
kagan,
i
think
you've
changed
positions
a
little
bit.
you
started
by
saying
there
were
three
ways
to
draw
a
line.
getting
clients
is
okay,
getting
clients
is
okay
if
you
get
a
specific
treatment,
occurrence
or
defect,
and
you
didn't
mention
what
the
third
was.
so,
what's
your
preferred
reading?
