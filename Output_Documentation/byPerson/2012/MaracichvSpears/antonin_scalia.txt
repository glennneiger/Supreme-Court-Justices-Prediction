justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
south?
i
don't
have
a
compass
here.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
that
language.
it's
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation.
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
are
saying
investigation
includes
solicitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that
is
fair.
i
think
their
position
is
to
harmonize
(b)(4)
and
(b)(12),
you
have
to
interpret
investigation
not
to
include
solicitation.
because
otherwise
you
have
a
conflict,
that
(b)(12)
prohibits
solicitation
unless
you
have
the
consent,
whereas,
(b)(4),
which
says
investigation,
does
not
require
consent.
now,
the
two
exist
in
perfect
harmony
if
investigation
does
not
include
solicitation,
but
there
is
a
discrepancy
between
the
two
if
it
does
include
solicitation.
and
you
have
to
say,
well,
this
is
an
exception
from
(b)(12).
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
north
of
that
line,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
which
is
specific
and
which
is
general.
i
mean,
that's
the
problem
i
have
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying
the
state
bar
requirements
would
have
required
you
to
say,
are
you
interested
in
joining
the
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
