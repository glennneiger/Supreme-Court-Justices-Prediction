we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-25,
maracich
v.
spears.
mr.
guerra.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
hard
to
argue,
when
you
have
(b)'s
(1)
through
(14),
that
(b)(12)
is
the
core
provision.
usually
it's
1
of
14
items
in
a
list.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
--
how
is
somebody
conducting
an
investigation
in
anticipation
of
litigation
--
hasn't
started
yet
--
acting
as
an
officer
of
the
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
just
seems
to
me
to
be
saying
that
lawyers
are
always
acting
as
an
officer
of
the
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--when
you're
preparing
a
discovery
request,
when
you're
--
anything
--
anything
that
the
officer
functions--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
thing
we
also
know
about
the
in
connection
with
language
is
we
have
said,
it
can't
really
mean
in
connection
with
as
broadly
as
that
--
the
morales
case,
i
guess,
it
has
to
have
a
more
narrow
meaning.
otherwise
everything
would
be
covered.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
a
very
poor
lawyer
who
couldn't
figure
out
how
to
write
the
letter
he's
going
to
send
out
in
a
way
that
it
could
not
be
said
to
be
investigation
as
opposed
to
solicitation.
if
you
have
a
problem
with
the
windshield
wipers,
you
just
send
a
letter
saying,
there
is
this
big
problem
with
windshield
wipers.
i
am
a
lawyer,
i'm
representing,
or
i
hope
to
represent
or
i
will
represent
a
group
of
people
who
have
this
problem
and
i
think
we
will
recover
some
damages.
would
you
like
to
be
a
witness
in
this
case?
that
is
in
anticipation
of
litigation,
but
it's
also
quite
plainly
an
effort
to
solicit
clients,
not
just
witnesses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
is
the
line?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that's
the
words
of
the
statute.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
they
mean.
if
you
think
there
is
some
type
of
solicitation
that
the
statute
was
meant
to
prohibit,
how
do
you
draw
a
line
that
prohibits
that
but
allows
the
sort
of
thing
that
you
want
to
do?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
doesn't
have
to
be
filed
in
court,
that
may
just
be--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--residing
in
the
brain
of
any
lawyer
who's
looking
for
work.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
right.
i
understand
your
point,
that
this
is
--
they're
not
separate
categories
and
there's
no
overlap.
but
the
word
is
harmonizing,
and
the
problem
is
we
have
to
give
some
limiting
construction
to
in
connection
with,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
involved
in
that
endeavor,
it
does
make
sense
to
see
how
what
you're
going
to
cover
under
the
in
connection
with
relates
to
what's
exempt
under
the
other
provisions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
they
were
thinking
they
might
bring
an
ada
suit--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--their
position
does
create
--
the
point
your
friend
makes
--
it
does
create
a
special
exemption
from
a
solicitation
bar
for
lawyers.
lawyers
can
solicitate;
you
know,
acme
products
can't.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
connection
with
something
they
hope
might
someday
become
litigation,
depending
upon
the
answers
they
get.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
you
want
to
start
the
suit.
it
doesn't
matter
in
your
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
guerra,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-25,
maracich
versus
spears.
