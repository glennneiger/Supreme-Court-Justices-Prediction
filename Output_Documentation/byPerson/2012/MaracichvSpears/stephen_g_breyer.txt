justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
they
do
this:
can
lawyer
smith
say,
you
know,
there
are
some
products
in
this
state
that
i
really
suspect
are
not
being
properly
made
and
i
have
probably
a
tort
suit;
and
the
damages
are
awfully
small;
i
would
like
to
get
10
or
20,000
plaintiffs.
i
wonder
if
there
is
anybody
interested.
and
then
what
he
does,
i
have
to
write
them
a
letter
and
i
know
where
i
can
get
the
names
and
addresses,
from
the
dmv.
so
he
goes
to
the
dmv
and
says:
i
would
like
the
names
of
everybody
who
--
i'd
like
all
your
names
and
addresses,
and
i
intend
to
write
them
all
and
send
them
a
letter
and
say:
i
suspect
there
is
some
fishy
business
going
on
here
in
the
dress
manufacturers;
would
you
like
to
tell
me
about
what
happens?
is
that
possible?
can
they
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
they
--
maybe
this
is
all
passe.
maybe
--
perhaps
they
could
get
this
information
elsewhere,
but
i
guess
we
have
to
deal
with
this
statute--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
maybe
what
they
want
is
they
want
the
names
of
all
the
people
who've
ever
had
a
car,
you
know,
because
they
think
there's
something
special
about
a
car,
and
they
think
that's
going
to
be
connected.
but
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
no
lawsuit,
but
you
are
going
to
get
one
if
you
can,
and
you
have
grounds
for
thinking
that
there
is
some
suspicious
defendants
and
what
you
are
looking
for
is
plaintiffs.
that's
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
you
are
looking
for
is
plaintiffs.
now,
can
you
under
this
statute
go
and
get
the
information
where
all
you
are
looking
for
is
plaintiffs
for
your
lawsuit?
so
far,
you
know
how
many
plaintiffs
you
have?
none.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
your
answer
what
i
have
in
my
mind
--
i'm
just
repeating
the
same
question.
i
will
do
that,
i
have
some
reason
for
thinking
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
defendants
here
who
have
done
something
wrong.
all
i
am
lacking
is
a
plaintiff
and
what
i
want
to
do
is
get
the
names
of
potential
plaintiffs.
it's
the
same
question.
i
have
asked
that
three
times.
either
you
can,
in
your
view,
get
it
under
this
lawsuit
or
you
cannot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
not
liking
or
disliking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
that's
your
--
now,
that's
the
line.
as
to
some
of
these
defendants
what
he's
saying
is
these
lawyers
had
no
client
that
my
defendant
hurt.
none.
and
as
to
some
of
these
but
not
all
the
requests,
all
they
were
doing
was
they
were
looking
for
somebody
who
bought
a
car
from
me,
and
the
reason
they
want
that
is
to
ask
them
what
the
practice
was
so
they
can
get
a
plaintiff
to
do
what
the
complaint
is
about.
so
it's
at
least
one
or
two
of
the
requests
are
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
repeat
to
me
--
i've
got
your
point,
you
have
don't
have
to
prove
it
to
me.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
the
statement
that
i
could
write
in
an
opinion
that
will
draw
the
boundary
of
this
provision
south
of,
well,
the
lawyer
can
go
out
when
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
a
defendant
has
done
something
wrong,
and
to
use
a
pejorative,
troll
for
clients.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
it
south
of
that,
and
now
you
will
tell
me
the
words
i
can
use
that
will
both
help
your
client
because
they
will
cover
this
case,
but
will
also
be
south
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
south
means
--
south
means
it
does
not
--
you
can't
just
go
and
troll
for
clients
simply
because
you
think
a
defendant
has
done
something
wrong,
and
you
have
no
client.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
are
saying
that
really
this
is
a
--
the
way
the
statute
works
is
it
says
nobody
can
solicit
but
for
lawyers,
and
that's
not
--
that
makes
more
sense
than
you
might
think,
because
this
was
not
a
statute
that
was
meant
to
interfere
with
solicitation
rules,
it
was
meant
to
interfere
with
commercial
selling.
and
that's
what
this
is
about,
and
there
is
a
requirement,
the
requirement
as
to
the
lawyer,
in
good
faith,
has
to
believe
that
if
he
finds
a
client
there's
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difficulty
that
justice
alito
brings
out
is
--
i
see
your
interpretation,
and
i
hope
the
other
side
will
give
me
some
line,
because
they
have
the
same
problem
in
reverse.
what
is
the
line?
but
your
way,
it
doesn't
become
that
much
of
a
privacy
statute.
it's
sort
of
a
misnomer.
it's
a
statute
that
is
designed
to
prevent
the
commercial
use
of
your
--
of
this
personal
information.
it's
not
really
a
privacy
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason
--
the
reason
that
would
be
so
--
i
agree
with
you
that
it's
very
hard
to
figure
out
what
the
line
is
here
between
the
investigation
and
solicitation.
but
that's
where
the
solicitation
thing
comes
into
play,
because
what
it
--
the
words
that
go
the
other
way,
in
my
mind,
that
cut
against
you
is
that
this
card
could
have
asked
for
social
security
numbers,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not
under
south
carolina
law,
but
then
under
another
state
under
this
statute,
they
could.
now,
that's
helpful,
that
answer.
but
--
when
i
think
of
asking
for
social
security
numbers,
the
words
--
exaggerated,
but
they
go
through
my
mind
--
are
identity
theft
run
wild.
and
if
that
is
a
concern,
if
that
is
a
concern,
then
by
reading
this
as
a
solicitation,
you
know
the
pure
case,
and
throwing
the
other
exception
to
cover
it,
you
force
the
state
to
focus
on
it.
and
the
state
then
has
to
decide
whether
they
are
going
to
permit
or
not
permit
the
solicitor,
who,
you
see,
might
include
the
lawyer
here,
to
ask
for
the
social
security
number.
and
better
to
have
them
focus
on
that
decision.
that's
the
connection
that
i
see
between
the
two.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
that
is
helpful,
because
do
we
know
under
how
many
states'
law
the
dmv
would
be
forbidden
to
give
social
security
numbers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
don't
you
give
us
the
line
that's
north.
north
of
trolling.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
not
north
of
trolling,
but
you
understand
the
point.
what's
your
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
middle
of
the
--
in
the
middle
of
the
class
action,
several
of
the
clients,
the
only
ones
who
brought
--
who
bought
the
cars,
which
there
is
loads
of
evidence
they're
defective
from
dealer
smith,
died,
and
they
want
to
see
if
they
can
find
three
others
so
they
don't
have
to
dismiss
them
from
the
class,
they're
almost
certain
and
has
loads
of
evidence
there
is
the
--
you
know,
the
harm
caused
by
the
defendant.
they
are
missing
a
client.
they
died.
and
so
can
they
get
it
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
they
go
to
the
board
and
say,
look,
dealer
smith
here,
we're
in
the
middle
of
the
case,
we're
finished
with
discovery.
we're
just
--
he
just
died
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
want
to
find
three
others
and
i'm
sure
there's
loads
of
evidence
here
that
there
were
a
hundred
thousand
others
who
bought
this
defective
thing
from
this
defendant,
we
want
to
find
out
the
names
and
addresses.
can
they
get
it
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
not.
