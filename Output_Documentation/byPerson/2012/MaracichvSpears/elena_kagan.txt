justice
elena
kagan
mr.
guerra,
i
have
to
admit
that
given
what
a
mess
this
statute
is,
those
three
words
don't
quite
do
it
for
me.
so,
the
argument
against
you,
right,
as
using
(b)(12)
to
define
(b)(4),
is
that,
look,
this
is
just
a
list
of
exceptions
to
a
general
prohibition
and
no
one
is
more
general
or
specific
than
any
other,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
fit
within
one
of
them.
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
don't
fit
within
two
of
them
if
you
don't
fit
within
one
of
them.
so
then
the
question
would
be
are
you
covered
by
(b)(4)
or
not?
if
not,
are
you
covered
by
(b)(12)
or
not?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
guerra,
where
do
you
get
that
from
in
(b)(4),
this
focus
on
tribunals
rather
than
lawyers?
because
the
investigation
is
done
by
lawyers,
right?
and
that's
a
critical
part
of
(b)(4),
so
where
does
that
come
from
in
the
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
but
then
it
includes
things
that
are
clearly
done
by
lawyers.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
distinction
--
i
understand
that
you
are
deriving
some
of
it
from
(b)(12),
but
if
i
--
just
assume
with
me
that
(b)(12)
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything,
and
you
were
just
limited
to
(b)(4),
can
you
find
that
distinction
in
(b)(4)?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
guerra,
don't
you
think
--
i
mean,
i
understand
the
distinction.
the
lawyer
as
commercial
actor
versus
lawyer
as
officer
of
the
court.
but,
boy,
it's
hard
to
get
that
from
the
words
here.
i
mean,
that
seems
like
the
kind
of
old-time
legislative
interpretation,
where
we
just
figured
out
the
statute
that
we
hoped
congress
would
have
written
as
opposed
to
the
statute
that
it
did.
i
mean,
tell
me
where
that
distinction
is
in
this
provision.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
guerra,
suppose
i
am
a
lawyer
and
i
want
to
bring
a
toxic
tort
case,
and
i
am
really
--
i
am
looking
for
witnesses
who
have
the
same
kind
of
symptoms
as
my
client
had.
and
so
i
put
out
a
letter
saying,
you
know,
have
you
have
been
exposed
and
--
and
tell
me
about
it
so
that
i
can
find
out
if
you
are
a
good
witness.
and,
you
know,
if
you
have,
i
would
also
like
to
represent
you.
would
--
would
that
count?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
what
i
was
suggesting
was
that
if
i
was
just
asking
for
witnesses,
you
would
have
to
say
that
that
was
included
by
(b)(4).
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
now,
the
court
--
the
lawyer
is
saying
in
addition
to
your
help
as
a
witness,
if
you
have
the
same
symptoms,
you
know,
you
can
join
the
suit.
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
about
your
line,
mr.
clement?
justice
elena
kagan
let
me
just
see
if
i
understand
it
and
i'll
give
you
two
things--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
i
think
one
falls
on
one
side
of
your
line--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
the
other
falls
on
the
other,
but
this
is
just
to
clarify
where
your
line
is.
one
is,
you
know,
i'm
a
lawyer,
have
you
ever
been
in
a
car
accident
lately?
if
you
have,
contact
me
and
i
would
love
to
represent
you.
that
--
the
other
is,
i'm
a
lawyer,
i
think
that
there's
a
--
a
real
--
i'm
--
i'm
bringing
a
lawsuit
about
these
red
light
cameras
and
saying
that
they're
unlawful
and
would
you
like
to
join
me
in
that
litigation.
am
i
right
to
think
that
the
first
falls
on
one
side
of
the
line,
it's
not
enough,
there's
no
litigation
there
and
the
seconds
falls
on
the
other
side,
according
to
you?
justice
elena
kagan
but
your
line--
justice
elena
kagan
--is
a
contemplated
litigation.
justice
elena
kagan
a
specific
contemplated
litigation.
justice
elena
kagan
but
which
do
you
say,
mr.
clement,
that
you
and
your
varsity
version
of
the
--
which
is
stronger
than
the
other
one
is--
justice
elena
kagan
--is
something
like
if
(b)(4)
is
hard,
we
have
to
draw
a
line
someplace,
we
can
look
to
(b)(12)
as
expressing
some
kind
of
concern
that
we
can
use
to
draw
that
line.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
not
a
conflict,
we
don't
have
to
--
you
know,
it's
not
inconsistent,
it's
just
this
is
an
expression
of
what
was
congress
was
thinking
about,
we're
going
to
use
it
as
a
clue.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
guerra,
it
didn't
draw
the
line
at
solicitation
in
(b)(4)
and
the
advantage
of
mr.
clement's
argument
is
that
the
line
that
he
sets
up
actually
has
a
textual
basis
in
(b)(4).
because
it
focuses
on
words
like
what
is
a
litigation
and
what
is
a
proceeding
and
are
we
there
yet.
and
that
seems
to
be
what
the
language
of
(b)(4)
indicates.
