justice
elena
kagan
--but,
general
verrilli,
this
statute
greatly
expands
the
government's
surveillance
power.
nobody
denies
that.
and
so
if
the
question
from
these
lawyers'
perspective
is,
what
chance
do
i
have
of
being
overheard,
and
what
precautions
do
i
have
to
take,
this
statute
makes
them
think
about
that
question
in
an
entirely
different
way,
doesn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
if
you
take
the
baseline
position
before
this
statute
and
the
position
after
this
statute,
these
lawyers
and
other
people
in
their
situation
are
going
to
understand
that
this
is
just
true,
that
the
government
is
intercepting
more
material,
and
that
they
have
to
take
greater
precautions
in
order
to
keep
their
conversations
confidential,
if
that's
what
they
want
to
do,
which
lawyers
want
to
do.
so
they're
going
to
take
precautions
that
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
take
the
day
before
this
statute
was
passed,
it
seems
to
me,
just
from
a
kind
of
commonsensical
point
of
view.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i
don't
see
why,
general
verrilli,
this
case
is
any
different
from
monsanto.
in
monsanto,
the
government
deregulates
genetically
modified
alfalfa,
says,
go
plant
it.
now,
there
were
these
farmers
who
were
complaining,
and
they
said,
we
don't
know
if
that
will
contaminate
our
crops
or
not;
we
think
that
there's
a
significant
risk
that
it
will
contaminate
our
crops.
because
we
think
that
there's
that
significant
risk,
we
have
to
take
precautions.
now,
why
isn't
that
exactly
what's
happening
in
this
case?
we
now
think,
says
the
--
say
the
lawyers,
that
there
is
a
significant
risk
that
our
conversations
will
be
surveilled,
a
risk
that
didn't
exist
before.
because
of
that
significant
risk,
we
have
to
take
precautions
of
the
exact
same
kind
that
the
farmers
in
monsanto
took;
therefore,
there
is
standing.
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
see
that
difference
at
all,
general
verrilli--
justice
elena
kagan
--because,
in
fact,
what
monsanto
did
--
it's
not
congress;
it's
an
agency
--
but
the
agency
issued
a
rule
saying
that
farmers
could
go
plant
genetically
modified
crops.
and
then
there
was
the
question
whether,
because
of
that,
essentially,
delegation
of
authority,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
were
going
to
be
burdened.
and
the
plaintiffs
said,
you
know,
we
might
be
harmed,
and
we
have
to
take
precautions
in
order
not
to
be
harmed.
so
it's
the
same
thing.
it's
a
different
actor,
but
it's
a
delegation
of
authority
and
a
--
and
a
fear
that
that
delegation
of
authority
will
result
in
harm
leading
to
a
set
of
precautions.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
is
it
really
such
speculation,
general?
i
mean,
just
imagine
that
--
yourself
in
this
lawyer's
position,
and
the
lawyer
says,
i'm
representing
a
person
associated
with
a
terrorist
organization,
i'm
representing
klm
in
the
case
of
one
of
these
lawyers,
and
i'm
going
to
be
talking
to
that
person's
family
members
and
associates
and
trying
to
find
out
everything
that
i
can.
now,
as
a
lawyer,
would
you
take
precautions,
or
would
you
pick
up
the
phone
and
start
writing
e-mails
to
all
those
people?
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
even
think
it
has
to
do
with
an
ethics
rule.
if
you're
a
good
lawyer
--
forget
the
ethics
rule
and
how
the
ethics
rules
apply.
are
you
really
going
to
tell
me
that
you,
as
a
lawyer,
would
just
pick
up
the
phone
in
the
face
of
this
statute
and
talk
to
these
terrorists'
associates?
justice
elena
kagan
in
summers,
the
court
said--
justice
elena
kagan
--excuse
me.
in
summers,
the
court
said,
well,
we
don't
know
that
this
person
is
just
going
to
stumble
upon
a
piece
of
land
that's
affected
by
this
government
action.
i
asked
you
a
different
question.
you're
a
lawyer
representing
a
terrorist
and
talking
to
the
terrorist's
affiliates,
and
the
question
is,
is
this
statute
going
to
make
you
not
use
the
e-mail
in
the
way
that
you
ordinarily
would
use
the
e-mail?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
jaffer,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
--
the
government's
strongest
argument
goes
something
like
this
--
and
i
don't
think
that
they
would
say
it
in
these
words,
but
you
have
some
clients
where
it
actually
does
seem
completely
reasonable
that
they
would
take
precautions,
that
they
would
not
get
on
the
phone,
and
that
they
would
not
use
e-mail
in
the
way
that
any
old
person
would.
but
just
--
those
clients,
these
lawyers
of
terrorists,
essentially
shouldn't
be
using
that
e-mail
or
getting
on
the
phone
anyway.
even
before
the
faa
was
passed,
they
would
have
been
wise
and,
indeed,
maybe
ethically
required
to
use
precautions.
so
what
does
the
faa
do?
i
guess
this
is
a
point
about
redressability,
it's
a
point
about--
justice
elena
kagan
--causation,
but
that
seems
to
me
the
strongest
of
the
government's
arguments.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
have
specifics
in
the
affidavits
of
things
that
your
clients
would
have
done
previously
that
they
cannot
do
now?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
jaffer,
you
mentioned
your
journalist
clients.
do
you
have
any
affidavits
or
anything
else
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
those
journalists
have
simply
not
gotten
information
from
third
parties
that
they
otherwise
would
have
gotten?
in
other
words,
this
would
not
be
a
question
of
what
precautions
they
took
and
what
precautions
were
reasonable.
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
you
assume
that
information
is
the
lifeblood
of
journalism,
that
their
sources
and
their
information
has
dried
up
as
a
result
of
this
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
a
fair
point,
general.
what
if
it
said
something
different?
what
if
she
said
--
what
if
there
were
even
an
affidavit
from
the
source
saying,
"i
have
stopped
talking
with
this
journalist
because
of
the
faa
and
because
of
my
fear
that
my
communications
will
be
intercepted?
"
justice
elena
kagan
no,
general
verrilli,
this
is
not
about
the
merits
of
the
statute.
they
might
have
no
claim
on
the
merits
at
all,
and
so
there
would
be
no
question
of
invalidation.
the
question
is
only:
can
they
make
their
argument
to
a
court?
