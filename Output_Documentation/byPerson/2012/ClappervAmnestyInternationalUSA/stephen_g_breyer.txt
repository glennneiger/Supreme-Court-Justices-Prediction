justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here
is
--
i
assume
that
it
is
an
injury
for
an
american
speaking
in
america
to
have
his
communication
intercepted
against
his
will
by
the
american
government.
we
take
that
as
a
harm;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
the
question
is
how
likely
is
that
to
occur?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
fine.
that's
why
i
say
certainly
--
it
might
not
be
a
storm
tomorrow.
i
mean,
you
know,
nothing
is
certain.
but
i
see
it's
some
degree
of
what
you
say
--
some
people
say
certainly,
some
people
say
likelihood,
etc.
so
put
to
the
side.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
we
have
a
declaration
of
mr.
scott
mckay.
now,
mr.
scott
mckay
says
he's
represented
two
of
the
people
who
are
allegedly
part
of
al
qaeda
and
committed
crimes,
and
he
has
represented
them
for
some
time.
one
is
in
guantanamo.
another
is
charged
with
various
crimes
and
is
subject
to
many,
many
civil
suits.
in
the
course
of
that,
he
has
to
phone
and
has
phoned
lots
of
people
in
saudi
arabia,
in
the
various
arab
states,
and
in
the
past
the
u.s.
intercepted
some
10,000
telephone
calls
and
20,000
e-mail
communications
involving
his
client.
so
isn't
it
a
fair
inference,
almost
pretty
certain,
maybe
about
as
much
as
the
storm,
that
if
the
security
agencies
are
doing
their
job,
they
will,
in
fact,
intercept
further
communications
involving
this
particular
individual,
the
two
that
he's
representing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
why
doesn't
that
meet
the
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
can't
we
get
an
answer
to
that
question?
i
mean,
i
see
your
point.
i'm
interrupting
because
i
see
where
you're
going.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
at
least,
if
held
in
camera,
i
can't
imagine
what
security
it
would
violate,
whether
the
government
were
to
say,
if
necessary
privately
to
a
judge,
would
say,
no,
we
do
not
intend
to
use
this
new
authority
for
this
purpose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
it
could
say
the
contrary.
and
so
couldn't
we
find
out
whether
he
has
standing
there
without
jeopardizing
any
concern
of
national
security?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is
if,
in
fact,
the
government
is
going
to
use
this
statute
to
continue
to
do
some
of
the
10,000
or
20,000--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
think
it's
speculation.
the
government
has
a
statute
that
says
you
can
wiretap
in
the
united
states
organized
crime
when
life
is
at
stake
and
you
show
it
to
a
judge.
then
they
say,
that
isn't
good
enough.
we
pass
a
new
statute,
and
it
says,
suppression
of
organized
crime,
wiretap
when
you
want,
without
a
judge.
now,
a
lawyer
who
represents
organized
crime
says,
my
clients
have
been
wiretapped
under
the
first
statute
400,000
times.
now,
i'll
tell
you,
when
the
government
gets
ahold
of
this
second
statute,
it's
going
to
be
a
million
times,
because
they
want
to
suppress
organized
crime.
i'm
not
saying
my
clients
are
guilty,
but
we
all
know.
okay.
so.
now,
the
question,
which
i
haven't
thought
of
before,
you
are
saying
no
standing,
no
standing,
can't
raise
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
you
can't.
you
can't
do
that
here.
so
--
so
what
i'm
thinking
is,
he
seems
to
be
separate
from
other
people.
he
seems
very
likely
to
have
a
concrete
injury.
if
they
--
if
they
aren't
wiretapping
the
people
who
are
described
here,
who
are
they
wiretapping?
and
they
passed
this
statute
in
order
to
have
extra
authority.
so
put
those
three
things
together,
and
they
seem
to
spell
mother,
perhaps,
you
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
the
--
which
i
think
is
difficult,
because
it
makes
this
case
somewhat
unique,
so
that
what
you're
worried
about
most
is
the
definition
of
foreign
intelligence
information,
which
defines
it
to
include
information
with
respect
to
a
foreign
power
or
foreign
territory
that
relates
to
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs.
it's
very
general.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then,
the
attorney
general
can,
if
he
decides
there
are
exigent
circumstances,
wiretap
for
a
year,
anyway,
without
going
to
any
court,
something
that
isn't
true
of
the
ordinary
wiretapping.
now,
you
say,
look,
if
there
is
any
special
group
that's
going
to
apply
to,
that
is
the
group
that
they
wiretapped
10,000
times
when
they
didn't
even
have
that
authority.
and
the
government
is
saying,
maybe,
maybe
not.
and
there,
we
have
an
argument.
is
there
a
way
of
resolving
it?
that
is,
is
it
open
to
the
government,
if
you
prevail,
and
we
say,
you
know,
they
have
this
extra
broad
authority,
there
is
no
way
to
check
it
through
a
court,
it
does
cause
harm,
these
are
the
most
likely
people
to
be
harmed
and
there
is
very
good
reason,
whatever
words
we
use
there,
to
think
it
will
be
used
for
them,
that
the
government
--
is
there
some
way
the
government
could
say,
in
camera
even,
no,
we
are
not
doing
it?
here
are
our
procedures.
we
are
not
going
to
show
them
to
anybody
but
you,
judge.
i
mean,
is
there
a
way
for
the
government
to
show
that
you're
wrong--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
that
we're
wrong
when
we
think
you're
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
on
that
branch
of
your
argument,
which
makes
me
more
nervous
than
the
other
branch.
the
other
branch,
they
might
say
something
like:
we're
supposed
to
minimize
risks
of
catching
in
surveillance
americans
and
this
is
what
we
do.
and
they
show
that
and
they
say:
we
go
to
the
fisa
court.
except
in
these
very
rare
instances
where
there
are
emergencies,
da,
da,
da.
and
i
guess
by
that
point
they
might
be
able
to
reduce
the
risks
to
this
kind
of
plaintiff
to
where
it's
the
same
as
virtually
anybody
else
or
they
might
be
--
be
showing
it's
constitutional.
that's
where
i
--
that's
why
i
ask
the
question.
i'm
not
certain
of
where
i
am
going.
