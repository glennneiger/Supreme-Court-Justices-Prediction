if
we
accept
the
--
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
“
certainly
impending
”
is
the,
the
general
standard,
if
we
accepted
your
other
argument,
that
the
plaintiffs
have
standing
because
they
took
preventative
measures,
wouldn't
that
undermine
completely
the
--
the
“
certainly
impending
”
standard?
you
have
a
person
who
is
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
certain
risk,
a
certain
degree
of
risk
of
--
of
the
person's
conversation
being
intercepted,
but
it's
not
certainly
impending.
so
then
the
person
simply
takes
some
preventative
measures,
and
acquires
standing
that
wouldn't
otherwise
be
present.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
go
back
to
a
question
that
justice
breyer
asked,
where
he
used
the
analogy
of
a
lawyer
who
is
representing
someone
who
is
alleged
to
be
an
organized
crime
figure.
suppose
you
have
a
case
where
a
lawyer
says,
i
represent
so
and
so,
the
government
thinks
this
person
is
an
organized
crime
kingpin,
i
know
the
government
has
a
very
extensive
wiretapping
program
for
people
who
fall
into
this
category,
i
want
to
raise
--
i
want
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
some
of
this
wiretapping
occurs.
would
that
person
have
stand
--
would
that
lawyer
have
standing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
know
of
any
case
that
holds
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
federal
wiretapping
statute
has
been
around
for
40
years.
has
there
been
a
single
case
that
falls
into
this
category
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
notice
provision
under
this
statute.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
what
you
just
suggested
as
a
way
of
resolving
this
case
rather
bizarre?
someone
who
is
--
whom
the
government
believes
to
be
a
top
terrorist
and
a
great
threat
to
the
country
can
stop
the
use
of
this
surveillance
by
hiring
an
american
lawyer
and
then
having
the
american
lawyer
come
into
court
and
say
--
you
know,
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
this,
and
the
way
to
resolve
the
case
would
be
for
the
government
to
go
into
court
and
say:
well,
we're
not
going
to
--
we're
not
going
to
target
this
--
this
person
whom
we
believe
to
be
a
great
security
threat?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
in
monsanto,
suppose
the
challenge
had
been
brought
by
a
soybean
farmer
who
said,
"i
raise
soybeans
and
people
around
me
raise
soybeans,
i'm
afraid
that
they're
going
to
start
planting
genetically
modified
soybeans,
but
they
haven't
done
it
up
to
this
point,
but,
you
know,
this
might
be
something
they
will
do
in
the
future
and
if
they
do
that,
then
i'm
going
to
have
to
take
precautions.
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
respondents
in
this
case
brought
suit
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
section
702
of
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
act
of
1978
which
was
added
by
the
fisa
amendments
act
of
2008
and
it's
codified
at
50
u.s.c.
section
1881
(a).
the
question
before
us
in
this
case
is
whether
the
second
circuit
was
correct
in
holding
that
respondents
have
article
iii
standing.
section
1881
(a)
allows
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
of
national
intelligence
to
acquire
foreign
intelligence
information
by
jointly
authorizing
their
surveillance
of
individuals
who
are
not
united
states
persons
and
they're
recently
believed
to
be
located
outside
the
country.
before
doing
so,
they
normally
must
obtain
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
court's
approval
and
surveillance
under
section
1881
(a)
is
subject
to
statutory
conditions,
judicial
authorization,
congressional
supervision,
and
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment.
respondents
are
united
states
persons
whose
work
allegedly
requires
them
to
engage
in
sensitive
international
communications
with
individuals,
they
believe
are
likely
targets
of
surveillance
under
section
1881
(a).
the
respondents
assert
that
they
can
establish
injury
in
fact
because
there
is
an
objectively
reasonable
likelihood
that
their
communications
will
be
acquired
under
section
1881
(a)
at
some
point
in
the
future.
but
this
theory
of
future
injury
is
too
speculative
to
satisfy
the
well-established
standing
requirement
that
threatened
injury
must
be
certainly
impending.
and
in
any
event,
any
threatened
injury
is
not
fairly
traceable
to
section
1881
(a).
in
the
alternative,
respondents
contend
that
they
are
suffering
present
injury
because
the
risk
of
section
1881
(a)
authorized
surveillance
already
has
forced
them
to
take
a
costly
and
burdensome
measures
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
their
international
communications.
but
respondents
cannot
manufacture
standings
by
choosing
to
make
expenditures
based
on
hypothetical
future
harm
that
is
not
certainly
impending.
we,
therefore,
hold
that
respondent's
lack
article
iii
standing.
we
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
sotomayor,
and
kagan
have
joined.
