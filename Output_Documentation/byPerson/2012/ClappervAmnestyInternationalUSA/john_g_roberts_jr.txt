chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-1025,
clapper
v.
amnesty
international.
general
verrilli.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
that
is
pertinent.
what
you're
saying
is
they
don't
have
standing
to
challenge
program
a
because
they
may
also
be
injured
under
program
b.
do
you
have
an
example
of
a
case
where
we've
held
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there
again,
it
depends
how
you
phrase
their
injury.
if
you
phrase
their
injury
as
being
subject
to
surveillance
under
a
particular
statutory
provision
that
they
think
is
facially
invalid,
saying
that,
well,
you're
not
going
to
get
any
relief
because
you're
going
to
be
subject
to
surveillance
under
a
different
provision,
i
mean,
they
may
say,
well,
we
may,
or
we
may
not,
but
we
still
have
the
right
to
cure
the
injury
of
being
subject
to
surveillance
under
1881a.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
jaffer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our
cases,
of
course,
say,
do
say
“
certainly
impending
”,
not
“
substantial
risk
”.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
let's
leave
that
aside.
you
have
two
arguments;
one
is
likelihood
of
future
injury
and
the
other
is
present
obligations
or
cause.
i
want
to
focus
on
the
former.
our
standard
is
certainly
impending,
and
you
articulated
it
by
saying,
substantial
risk.
there
is
obviously
a
vast
difference
between
those
two.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
enough,
of
course,
to
know
that
the
government
is
using
the
statute.
the
whole
question
is
whether
or
not
your
clients
have
been
injured,
not
whether
the
statute's
being
used.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
do
you
want
to
finish?
if
it's
all
right,
could
you
finish
the
answer?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
concern
you're
talking
about
is
present
in
every
area
of
practice.
if
you're
representing
someone
who
is
being
prosecuted,
you
don't
send
an
e-mail
saying,
you
know,
the
government
hasn't
yet
asked
where
you
threw
the
gun,
and
we've
got
to
be
prepared
to
answer
questions
on
that
because,
as
you
know,
that's
a
real
probable.
i
mean,
you
don't
send
messages
like
that
through
the
e-mails
or
just
talk
casually
over
the
phone
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
plaintiffs
aren't
going
to
be
monitored
under
the
statute.
other
people
are,
and
your
concern
is
collateral,
that
the
plaintiffs'
discussions
might
be
picked
up.
but
the
plaintiffs
are
not
going
to
be
monitored
as
targets.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
why
i'm
saying
under
your
circumstances
--
what
you
said
is
the
government
could
come
in
and
say:
we're
not
going
to
monitor
these
people.
under
the
statute,
you
can
say
that
today.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
your
clients'
conversations
can
be
picked
up
in
an
incidental
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
it's
a
difference
in
how
we're
using
the
word
monitor.
you
do
know
that
your
plaintiffs
have
not
been
monitored.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
you
don't
--
well,
others
have
been
monitored
abroad,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
not
monitored
in
the
sense
that
this
is
the
person's
e-mail,
and
that's
what
we're
going
to
collect
information
from,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
verrilli,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
and
so
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
in
case
11-1025,
clapper
versus
amnesty
international.
