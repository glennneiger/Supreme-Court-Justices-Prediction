justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
is
there
anybody
who
has
standing?
as
i
read
your
brief,
standing
would
only
arise
at
the
moment
the
government
decided
to
use
the
information
against
someone
in
a
pending
case.
to
me,
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--would
seem
to
say
that
the
act
--
if
there
were
a
violation;
i'm
not
suggesting
there
is
--
but
that
if
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
in
the
interception,
that
no
one
could
ever
stop
it
until
they
were
charged
with
a
crime,
essentially.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
i
don't
know
that
you've
answered
my
question.
perhaps
you
have,
but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i'm
clear.
given
that
lawyers
are
unlikely
to
be
the
targets
of
an
investigation,
if
their
conversations
would
be
intercepted,
according
to
you
they'd
never
have
standing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now
we're
back
at
the
same
circle
we
started
with,
which
is
the
one
that
justice
breyer
started
with.
he
pointed
to
one
person
under
--
who
has
been
surveilled
continuously,
tens
of
thousands
of
interceptions.
can
you
really
say
that
the
government's
not
going
to
target
him
under
this
greater
authority
that
it
sought
just
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
it
casts
a
broader
net?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
have
an
issue--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
you
address--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
you
go
back
to
being
a
little
bit
more
specific
on
this?
i
think
i
got
it.
there
is
a
class
of
people
that
they
would
have
spoken
to
on
the
phone
or
e-mailed
before
because
they
didn't
think
they
would
be
covered
by
other
surveillance
measures--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
were
in
effect
before
this
act?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
talk
about
what
kinds
of
people
those
are?
because
if
the
targets
are
always
terrorists--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
that
point,
you're
conceding
the
government's
position
that
--
on
redressability?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
even
if
they
promise
you
they
weren't
going
to
intercept
you
under
this
statute,
that
you
would
still
take
the
same
measures?
