mr.
jameel
jaffer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
plaintiffs
have
standing
here
because
there
is
a
substantial
risk
that
their
communications
will
be
acquired
under
the
act
and
because
this
substantial
risk
has
effectively
compelled
them
to
take
immediate
measures
to
protect
information
that
is
sensitive
or
privileged.
plaintiffs
are
lawyers,
journalists
and
human
rights
researchers
who
routinely
engage
in
communications
that
the
act
is
designed
to
allow
the
government
to
acquire.
plaintiffs
communicate,
for
example,
foreign
intelligence
information,
the
kind
of
information
that
the
statute
expressly
authorizes
the
government
to
collect,
to
retain
and
disseminate.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
a
--
a
question
even
in
cases
that
involve
only
a
future
injury,
whether
“
certainly
impending
”
is
in
fact
the
standard.
but
leaving
that
to
the
side,
this
is
not
a
case
that
involves
only
an
allegation
of
future
injury.
our--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--well,
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
the
court
has
settled
on
certainly
impending.
the
cases
that
the
--
the
government
cites
are
cases
like
--
i
think
that
the
one
that
the
government
cites,
relies
on
most
heavily
is
summers.
but
in
summers,
the
distinction
between
likelihood
and
certainly
impending
was
not
one
that
the
court
relied
on
in
--
in
that
decision.
the
court
said
that
plaintiffs
couldn't
meet
even
the
lower
standard.
so
i
think
that
the
discussion
of
certainly
impending--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--justice
kennedy,
the
--
the
--
the
cases
that
we
rely
on,
monsanto,
laidlaw,
meese
v.
keene,
these
are
cases
in
which
the
court
didn't
look
to
the
certainly
impending
standard
at
all.
the
question
that
the
court
asked
in
those
cases
was:
is
there
a
substantial
risk?
is
there
a
substantial
risk
that
effectively
compels
the
plaintiffs
to
act
in
the
way
they
are
--
they
are
acting?
you
are
right
that
the
government
points
out
this
distinction
in
monsanto.
they
say
monsanto
is
a
case
in
which
the
government
was
actually
doing
something,
was
known
to
--
to
be
doing
something.
but
even,
in
this
case,
first
of
all,
we
know
that
the
government
is
using
the
statute.
they
have
acknowledged
that
they
are
using
the
statute.
so
there
--
there
is
a
certainty
of
government
conduct.
but
aside
from
that,
those
cases
like
monsanto
and
laidlaw
and
meese
are
not
cases
that
--
that
actually
turned
on
the
fact
that
the
government
was
doing
something.
they
are
cases
that
turned
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
substantial
risk
of
future
injury,
and
the
substantial
risk
compelled
plaintiffs
to
do
something
immediately.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
i
--
i
agree
with
that.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
enough
for
a
plaintiff
to
walk
into
court
and
say
the
government
is
using
the
statute
and
therefore
we
have
standing.
but
our
plaintiffs
are
not
in
that
position.
our
plaintiffs--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--sure.
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
our
--
our
plaintiffs
have
--
have
reasons
to
believe
that
their
own
communications
will
be
monitored
under
the
statute.
one
relates
to
the
kind
of
information
that
they
routinely
exchange
over
the
phone
and
by
e-mail,
foreign
intelligence
information.
but
it's
also
that
--
that
plaintiffs
communicate
with
the
kinds
of
people
the
government
is
likely
to
--
to
monitor
under
the
statute.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
it
does,
justice
scalia.
i
mean
you
--
you
are
right
that
there
is
a
court
that
in
some
sense
stands
between
plaintiffs
and
the
future
injury
that
they
--
that
they
fear.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
i
don't
think
it's
that
simple.
the
--
the
--
the
court,
the
fisa
court,
is
tasked
with
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
targeting
and
minimization
procedures.
but
the
statute
itself
forecloses
the
court
from
imposing
the
kinds
of
limits
that
plaintiffs
think
the
fourth
amendment
requires.
so
for
example,
the
statute
itself
in
section
(g)(4)
says
that
the
government
is
not
required
to
identify
the
facilities
to
be
monitored.
and
the
statute
itself
in
defining
targeting
procedures
defines
them
to
be
procedures
intended
to
ensure
that
the
targets
are
outside
the
united
states.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
well,
the
court
would
have
to--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--well,
i
think
that's
right.
the
--
the
court--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--well,
i
think
if
that
had
happened
over
the
last
4
years,
the
government
wouldn't
be
seeking
reauthorization
of
the
statute
now.
but
even
apart
from
that--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--that's
absolutely
right,
justice
ginsburg.
there
--
the
whole
point
of
the
statute
was
to
remove
those
tests,
to
remove
the
probable
cause
requirement,
and
to
remove
the
facilities
requirement,
the
requirement
that
the
government
identify
to
the
court
the
facilities
to
be
monitored.
so
those
are
gone.
that's
why
we
use
the
phrase
“
dragnet
surveillance
”.
i
know
the
government
doesn't
accept
that
label,
but
it
concedes
that
the
statute
allows
what
it
calls
categorical
surveillance,
which
--
which
--
which
is
essentially
the
surveillance
that
the
plaintiffs
here
are
concerned
about.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
i
don't
think
it
would
undermine
the
--
the
future
injuries
standard,
your
honor,
for
a
couple
of
different
reasons.
the
first
is
that
“
fairly
traceable
”,
which
is
the
standard
that
the
court
has
used
when
there
is
an
actual
injury,
is
a
standard
that
does
real
work.
so
if
plaintiffs,
for
example,
were
acting
unreasonably
in
taking
the
measures
they
are
taking,
if
plaintiffs
were
gratuitously
buying
flight
tickets,
they
couldn't
create
standing
out
of
nothing.
it
would
have
to
be
a
reasonable
reaction
to
the
risk.
but
the
other
thing
is,
and
this
is
just
to
go
back
to
sort
of
the
--
the
basic
standing--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--you
are
right,
justice
scalia.
it
doesn't,
on
--
on
our
theory.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
and
the
only
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
if
there
is
a
distance
between
these
two
standards,
it's
a
--
it's
a
pretty
narrow
distance.
but
the
other
point
i
want
to
make
is
just
that
the
reason
--
to
the
extent
the
court
has
imposed
a
higher
standard
for
cases
involving
only
future
injury
--
and
again,
we
don't
concede
that
the
court
has
imposed
a
higher
standard,
but
to
the
extent
it
has,
it
has
done
so
because
it
wants
to
assure
itself
that
the
future
injury
is
sufficiently
concrete
to
warrant
the
court's
intervention.
but
if
there's
an
actual
injury,
the
court
is
assured
of
concreteness.
the
actualness
of
the
injury
makes
the
case
concrete
on
its
own.
and
so
i
think
that
the
standards
do
different
work.
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
an
end-run
around
the
imminent
standard.
it's
a
question
of
the
court
assuring
itself
that
there
is
a
concrete
case
before
it.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
right.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
well,
justice
kagan,
this
is
something
that
the
declarations
address
specifically,
the
distinction
between
the
burden
imposed
by
fisa,
traditional
fisa,
and
the
burden
imposed
by
the
new
statute.
and
it's
true
that
the
old
--
under
the
old
statute,
plaintiffs
were
required
to
take
precautions
with
respect
to
a
subset
of
their
communications.
and
they
acknowledge
that
in
their
declarations.
but
the
new
statute
reaches
whole
categories
of
people
who
couldn't
have
been
reached
under
fisa.
fisa
had
a
probable
cause
requirement.
it
had
to
be
a
foreign
agent
on
one
end
of
the
phone.
and
so
when
one
of
the
lawyers
in
this
case
was
talking
to
somebody
who
they
thought
the
government
might
believe
to
be
a
foreign
agent,
they
took
those
precautions
even
before.
but
now
they
have
to
take
those
precautions
--
some
of
which
are
very
costly
--
they
have
to
take
those
precautions
with
respect
to
people
who
are,
for
example,
witnesses
overseas,
of
journalists
overseas
or
human
rights
researchers
overseas.
as
scott
mckay
says
in
his
declaration,
with
respect
to
every
single
international
communication,
i
have
to
make
an
assessment
of
the
risk
that
the
government--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--yes,
your
honor.
so,
for
example
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
this
goes
directly
to
your
question,
but
in
the
mckay
affidavit,
as
well
as
in
the
sylvia
royce
affidavit
--
sylvia
royce
is
another
one
of
the
attorney
plaintiffs
in
this
case
--
both
of
those
plaintiffs
discuss
the
additional
burden
of
the
faa.
they
talk
about
measures
that
they
are
taking
because
of
the
<faa>
[=
faa]
specifically.
and
they
mention
the
kinds
of
communications
they're
having
with
people
who
could
not
reasonably
be
thought
to
be
foreign
agents.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
i
think
it's
a
spectrum,
justice
ginsburg.
it
begins
with
just
being
more
circumspect
on
the
telephone,
and
it
goes
to,
for
example,
talking
in
generalities
rather
than
specifics.
let
me
see
if
i
can
give
you
actual
citations
for
these.
so
--
so
--
so,
the
plaintiffs
have
in
some
cases
been
deterred
from
communicating
on
e-mail
or
the
phone.
chris
hedges
discusses
that
at
366a
of
the
appendix;
scott
mckay
discusses
it
at
371a.
in
some
instances,
the
plaintiffs
have
talked
in
generalities
rather
than
specifics.
sylvia
royce
at
352a.
in
some
instances,
it
has
even
required
plaintiffs
to
travel
overseas
to
gather
information
that
they
might
otherwise--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--right.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
there
is
no
dollar
cost,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--but
there
is
a
professional
cost.
and
i
don't
think
it's
--
it
shouldn't
be
hard
to
understand
the
professional
cost.
if
a
lawyer
is--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--that's
right,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
that's
right.
the--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--right.
no.
right.
under
this
statute,
there's
no
requirement
that
the
target
be
a
terrorist
or
a
foreign
agent,
right?
so
under
this
statute,
every
time,
for
example,
sylvia
royce
has
to
make
a
phone
call
with
somebody
overseas
about
the
representation
of
somebody
that
she
is
representing,
she
needs
to
make
an
assessment
about
the
sensitivity
of
the
information,
about
the
way
that
information
might
be
used
against
her
client.
so,
for
example,
if
she
is
talking
to
a
journalist
in
afghanistan
about
the
detention
of
one
of
her
prisoners
at
bagram
air
base,
that
is
a
conversation
that
could
not
plausibly
have
been
picked
up
under
fisa,
but
it's
a
conversation
that
could
be
picked
up
under
the
faa.
now,
back
to--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--i
think
that's
--
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
that,
to
some
extent,
this
exists
in
every
area
of
practice.
but
this
is
a
statute
that
is
focused
on
gathering
foreign
intelligence
information,
and
our
clients
include
lawyers
who
represent
defendants
charged
with
foreign
intelligence-related
crimes.
and
this
statute,
i
think
for
good
reason,
makes
them
especially
concerned
about
the
communications
they
are
engaged
in
with
people
overseas
who
couldn't
have
been
covered
under
fisa,
but
who
are
covered
under
this
statute.
if
i
could
just
address--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--i
think
so.
i
think
so,
justice
alito.
i
mean,
assuming
that
the
lawyer
could
establish
that
there
was
a
substantial
risk
that
his
communications
would
be
--
would
be
monitored,
and
that
the
substantial
risk
had
compelled
him
to
take
measures
immediately,
i
think
that
lawyer
would
have
standing.
whether
he
would
have
a
claim
is
a
different
question,
but
i
think
he
would
have
standing.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
well,
i
think
that
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
novel
proposition.
i
think
that
in
every
one
of
--
for
example,
in
a
case
like
skinner,
which
was
a
challenge
to
the
rules
that
allowed
for
blood
tests
of
railway
employees
who
had
been
in
a
--
in
accidents,
that
was
a
facial
challenge
brought
to
the
statute,
and
nobody
questioned
standing
in
that
case.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
no,
but
i
think
that
that
--
that
there's
a
good
reason
for
that,
which
is
under
title
iii
people
who
are
monitored
get
notice.
there
is
a
notice
provision,
a
general
notice
provision.
and
so
it
doesn't
--
you
know,
and
people
don't
have
to
worry
that
this
is
going
on
secretly.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
only
for
prosecutions,
right?
only
for
prosecutions.
and
the
government
has
made
clear
that
it's
not
going
to
--
that
the
main
purpose
of
this
statute
is
not
to
gather
evidence
for
law
enforcement--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--that--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--yes.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
if
the
government
were
to
walk
into
court
either
today
or
after
the
remand
that
we
are
asking
for,
if
the
government
were
to
walk
into
court
either
in
camera
or
not
and
say
that
plaintiffs
will
never
be
monitored
under
this
statute,
i
think
the
case
would
be
over.
plaintiffs
--
plaintiffs
are
here
not
because
they
have
a
general
complaint
about
the
statute,
but
because
they're
actually
--
they're
injured
by
it,
and
they're
--
they
--
they--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that's
exactly
right.
i
know
that
the
statute
says
that
the
government
has
to
target
people
abroad,
but
in
targeting
people
abroad
the
government
is
collecting
plaintiffs'
communications.
so,
you
know,
this
isn't
a
situation
where
plaintiffs
are
entirely--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--right.
i
--
i
guess
i'm
disagreeing
with
the
word
“
incidental
”.
it's
--
the
whole
point
of
this
statute
was
to
allow
the
government
to
collect
americans'
international
communications.
the
--
the
executive
officials
threatened
a
presidential
veto
when
it
was
proposed
that
americans'
communications
should
be
segregated
in
some
way,
that
in
the
district
court
the
government
was
very
upfront
about
this,
that
the
statute's
whole
purpose
was
to
regulate
the
--
the
surveillance
of
americans'
international
communications.
so
there
is
a
sense
in
which
americans
--
the
surveillance
of
americans
is
incidental,
but
it's
a--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
something
like
that,
justice
alito.
you
know,
ultimately,
the
authority
that
the
government
has
claimed
under
this
statute
is
what
requires
the
plaintiffs
to
take
the
measures
that
they're
taking.
and
i
suppose
that
if
all
the
government
were
to
do
at
this
point
is
to
say
secretly
to
a
judge,
"we're
not
actually
going
to
use
this
against
plaintiffs.
"
plaintiffs
would
have
to
take
the
same
measures
they're
taking
right
now.
and
they
would
be
injured
in
exactly
the
same
way.
what--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--no,
not
at
all,
justice--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--no,
no,
i
wasn't
talking
about
the
other
programs.
i
was
just
saying
that
plaintiffs'
injuries
flow
from
the
authority
that
they're
--
that
they're
claiming
under
the
statute.
and
if
the
government
were
to
have
a
secret
--
you
know,
if
there
were
some
sort
of
secret
government
memo
that
said
plaintiffs
will
not
in
fact
be
surveilled,
their
communications
won't
be
picked
up,
if
plaintiffs
don't
know
about
that
change
to
the
government's
authority,
they're
going
to
have
to
take
the
same
measures
that
they're
taking.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
so
--
so
maybe
it's
helpful
to
think
of
the
--
the
cases
involving
pre-enforcement
challenges.
so
you
think
--
think
of
a
case
like
american
book
sellers
association,
which
we
cite
on
i
think
page
55
of
our
brief,
the
case
in
which
there's
uncertainty
about
how
the
government
is
going
to
implement
the
authority.
nobody
knows
whether
this
particular
plaintiff
is
going
to
be
prosecuted.
in
fact,
in
that
case
nobody
knew
whether
anybody
would
be
prosecuted.
but
the
authority
was
out
there
and
the
fact
that
the
authority
was
out
there,
the
government
hadn't
disclaimed
it,
plaintiffs
were
required
to
take
immediate
measures
to
conform
their
behavior
to
the
statute,
and
plaintiffs
--
some
of
the
injury
there
related
to
the
kind
of
self-censorship
that
the
court
has
always
been
especially
concerned
about
in
first
amendment
cases.
all
of
those
things
led
the
court
to
find
that
plaintiffs
had
standing
to
bring
a
pre-enforcement
challenge.
and
the
kind
of
uncertainty
that
the
government
says
is
present
here,
uncertainty
about
how
the
government
will
actually
implement
the
statute
is
the
same
kind
of
uncertainty
that
is
present
in
every
single
pre-enforcement
challenge.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
i
don't
think
that's
so,
justice
scalia.
our
concern
is
not
--
not
that
--
that
the
fisa
court
will
make
mistakes,
although
it
well
might.
the
concern
--
the
main
concern
is
that
the
reasonableness
inquiry
that
the
fisa
court
engages
in
is
a
narrowly
cabined
one.
they
court
can't
say
this
is
unreasonable
because
you
haven't
identified
the
facilities.
they
can't
say
this
is
unreasonable
because
you
haven't
identified
a
specific
target.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
i
think
in--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--right.
i
think
it's
within
the
realm
of
--
of
the
conceivable
that
--
that
the
court
could
essentially
subvert
the
statute
in
that
way
or
find
it
unconstitutional,
but
the
government
would
not
be
pressing
for
reauthorization
now,
and
plaintiffs
have
to
act
on
the
basis
of
the
authority
that
is
delineated
in
this
federal
law.
and
plaintiffs
see
that
there's
a
law
that
is
designed
to
allow
the
government
to
mine
americans'
international
communications
for
foreign
intelligence
information.
the
plaintiffs
are
people
who
report
on
war
zones
or
they
investigate
human
rights
abuses
in
places
like
syria
and
lebanon
and
the
yemen
and
the
sudan,
places
where
the
government
is
likely
to
use
this
power.
and
plaintiffs
include
people
who
represent
defendants
who've
been
charged
in
--
in
--
terrorism
crime
and
foreign
intelligence
related
crimes.
and
so
they--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--in
our
view,
they
act
entirely
reasonably
in
taking
the
measures
they're
taking
and
they
are
effectively
compelled
in
the
same
way
that
the
plaintiffs
in
monsanto,
in
laidlaw
in
--
in
--
in
meese
<v@l>
[=
v.]
keene
were
effectively
compelled
to
take
the
measures
that
they
--
that
they
were
taking.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
right.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
yes,
justice
kagan.
naomi
klein's
declaration
at
page
338a
addresses
that.
i
believe
that
chris
hedges'
declaration
addresses
it
too,
although
i
don't
have
a
page
citation
for
you.
it's
certainly
in
the
lawyers'
affidavits
that
some
third
parties
are
less
willing
to
share
information,
sylvia
royce,
353a.
so
--
so
--
so
the
declarations
were
filed
early,
it
was
a
summary
judgment
motion,
they
were
filed
relatively
early.
so
to
some
extent,
they
are
making
predictions
about
how
third
parties
will
--
will
react,
but
i
think
it's
an
entire
fair
prediction
to
--
to
predict
that
third
parties
who
believe
that
the
communications
are
being
surveilled
will
react
in
the
way
you
just
described.
and
although
it's
not
in
the
record,
we
--
we
have
spoken
to
our
journalist
clients
more
recently
and
they
have
told
us
that
their
predictions
have
actually
been
realized
in
some
cases.
just
to
go
to
--
to
--
to
address
the
--
the
--
the
monsanto
point
--
point
once
more.
i
mean,
i
understand
the
court's
--
that
the
court
has
to
struggle
with
the
distinction
between
cases
that
involve
only
future
injuries
and
cases
that
involve
present
injuries
as
well.
i
think
it's
just
important
to
recognize
that
the
court
has
never
found
the
kinds
of
present
injuries
that
we
are
pointing
to
here
to
be
irrelevant
to
the
analysis.
in
monsanto,
in
laidlaw,
in
meese,
in
camreta,
the
court
looked
to
--
looked
to
the
present
injuries
as
well
as
to
the
likelihood
of
--
of
--
of
future
harm.
and
we
are
not
making
an
argument
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
lower
--
lower
standing
--
to
lower
standing
requirements
or
less
stringent
requirements
than
the
court
has
applied
in
other
cases.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case
than
the
one
that
they've
brought.
i
mean,
in
part
because
the
plaintiff
would
presumably
know
when
--
when
the
soybeans
had
been
--
had
been
planted,
and
the
plaintiff
would
then
have
an
opportunity
to
come
into
court.
and
it
would
be
hard
to
--
to
establish,
i
think,
a
substantial
risk
in
those
circumstances
where
the
plaintiff
couldn't
point
to
any
evidence
that
--
that
any
action
had
been
taken
towards
the
implementation
of
this
policy
that
--
that
he
feared.
but
in
our
case,
again,
the
government
has
conceded
that
the
statute
is
being
used.
it's
conceded
--
or
it's
acknowledged
that
the
statute
has
been
used
to
collect
americans'
communications.
it's
true
that
we
don't
know
that
our
plaintiffs
specifically
have
been
monitored,
and
we
will
never
know
that.
but
that
kind
of
uncertainty
was
--
was
present
in
monsanto
and
in--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--been
targeted.
mr.
jameel
jaffer
i
don't--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--well,
what
--
what
happens
is
that
the
government
identifies
some
category
of
targets
abroad.
in
the
course
of
collecting--
mr.
jameel
jaffer
--those
targets'
communications,
they
collect
americans'
international
communications.
and
when
they're
collecting
americans'
international
communications,
they
are
monitoring
those
communications.
the
statute
allows
the
government
to
acquire
them,
to
retain
them,
to
disseminate
them.
it
requires
--
even
if
it's
not
foreign
intelligence
information,
which
is,
as
justice
breyer
says
--
recognized,
is
defined
very
broadly
--
the
statute
allows
the
government
to
disseminate
that
information,
just
redacting
the
americans'
name.
the
statute
also
allows
the
government
to
--
to
retain
evidence
of
criminal
activity.
and
for
criminal
defense
lawyers,
that's
--
that's
a
--
it's
a
real
issue.
so
you're
right
that
--
that
our
communications
are
not
being
targeted,
but
they
are
being
monitored.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
