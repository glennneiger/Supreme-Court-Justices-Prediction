justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
can
you
be
specific
on
who
that
person
would
be?
because,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
unlikely
that,
for
example,
the
lawyers
in
this
case
would
be
charged
with
any
criminal
offense.
it's
more
probable
that
their
clients
would
be;
but,
according
to
the
government,
their
clients
have
no
fourth
amendment
rights
because
they
are
people
who
are
noncitizens
who
acted
abroad.
so
it's
hard
for
me
to
envision.
i
see
the
theoretical
possibility,
but
i
don't
see
a
real
person
who
would
be
subject
to
a
federal
charge
who
could
raise
an
objection.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
client
is
somebody
who
is
abroad
and
who
acted
abroad,
and
is
not
a
u.s.
citizen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
likely
is
it
that
a
service
provider
would
object?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
litigation
was
unsuccessful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
using
what
you
just
mentioned,
suppose
--
just
let's
suppose
that
the
court
should
hold
there
is
standing.
wouldn't
the
government
then
say
as
far
as
the
merits
of
the
complaint,
this
information
is
classified,
is
a
state
secret,
we
can't
--
we
can't
go
forward
with
the
litigation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
but
in
this
case
the
complainant
can
never
know.
i
mean,
i
know
you
emphasize
the
speculative
nature
of
this
claim,
but
it's
not
speculative
if
the
government
being
given
this
authority
by
congress
is
going
to
use
it.
isn't
that
so?
i
mean,
are
we
to
assume
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
there
much
of
a
speculation
involved
in
how
--
i
think
it's
only
one
time,
and
it
was
under
the
pre-amended
statute,
that
the
fisa
court
ever
turned
down
an
application.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
never
know.
there
may
be
dozens
of
concrete
applications
affecting
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
but
we
will
never
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
jaffer,
could
you
be
clear
on
the
expanded
authority
under
the
faa?
as
i
understood
it,
it's
not
like
in
the
old
statute,
where
a
target
was
--
identified
and
fisa
decided
whether
there
was
--
the
court
decided
whether
there
was
probable
cause.
under
this
new
statute,
the
government
doesn't
say
who
is
the
particular
person
or
the
particular
location.
so,
there
isn't
that
check.
there
isn't
that
check.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
other
measures
besides
having
to
travel
to
have
conversations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
travel
overseas
i
understand
is
the
one
thing
that
has
a
dollar
amount
attached
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
these
other
precautions,
being
more
circumspect
in
their
questions,
talking
in
generalities--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
they
can
never,
never
have,
and
that's
what
makes
this
--
if
--
if
there
could
be
a
person
in
this
category
who
would
know,
but
the
person
will
never
know.
you
did
mention
minimization
procedures
as
one
safeguard
against
abuse.
what
are
the
minimum
--
what
--
what
minimization
standards
are
taken
that
will
protect
plaintiffs
in
this
class?
