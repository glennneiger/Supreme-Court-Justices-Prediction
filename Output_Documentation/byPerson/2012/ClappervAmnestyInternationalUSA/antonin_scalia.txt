mr.
verrilli,
we've
had
cases
in
the
past
where
it
is
clear
that
nobody
would
have
standing
to
challenge
what
is
brought
before
this
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we've
said
that
that
just
proves
that
under
our
system
of
separated
powers,
it
is
none
of
our
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
--
do
we
parse
injury
that
finely?
i
mean,
the
injury,
it
seems
to
me,
is
being
overheard.
does
it
--
by
the
government.
do
we
say,
oh,
well,
it's
one
injury
to
be
overheard
under
this
statute,
it's
another
injury
to
be
overheard
under
another
statute?
do
you
know
any
case
where
we've
--
we've
cut
the
baloney
that
fine?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
thing
is
they
are
going
to
be
injured
by
being
overheard.
and
you're
saying
that
they
will
be
overheard
anyway,
and,
therefore,
by
preventing
the
government
from
overhearing
them
under
this
statute,
we're
not
redressing
their
grievance,
which
is
being
overheard
by
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
that
assessment
take
into
account
the
fact
that
a
court
is
going
to
pass
upon
the
government's
ability
to
intercept
these
communications?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
the
obligation
to
apply
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
as
you
say
those
procedures
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
statute
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
those
statutory
provisions
would
produce
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
they
are
null
and
void,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
the
fisa
court
would
presumably
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
before
we
go
further.
a
reasonable
reaction
to
the
risk;
but
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
reasonable
reaction
to
a
certainly
impending
risk,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
his
question.
doesn't
it
undermine
the
certainly
impending?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jaffer,
apart
--
apart
from
the
government's
power
that
you
point
out
to
conduct
some
of
this
surveillance
without
approval
by
the
fisa
court
in
an
emergency
situation
for
1
year,
leaving
that
aside,
i
don't
see
how
the
rest
of
your
challenge
or
your
challenge
to
the
remainder
of
this
statute
can
be
characterized
as
a
facial
challenge,
because
it
necessarily
assumes
that
the
fisa
court
will
mistakenly
say
that
there
has
been
no
fourth
amendment
violation,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
--
it
can
say
it's
unreasonable
because
you
have
unreasonably
limited
us.
don't
you
think
the
fisa
court
is
able
to
say,
what
we're
allowed
to
look
into
under
this
statute
does
not
comport
with
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
to
look
into
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
restrictions
on
giving
the
information
to
other
government
agencies,
in
particular,
the
justice
department?
