mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
respondents
have
standing
to
bring
a
facial
challenge
to
the
2008
amendments
to
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
act.
those
amendments
provide
authority
to
the
executive
to
conduct
surveillance
targeted
at
foreign
persons
located
abroad
for
foreign
intelligence
purposes.
along
with
that
grant
of
authority,
congress
imposed
statutory
protections
designed--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--several
points,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--your
honor,
under
the
statute,
there
are
two
clear
examples
of
situations
in
which
the
individuals
would
have
standing.
the
first
is
if
an
aggrieved
person,
someone
who
is
a
party
to
a
communication,
gets
notice
that
the
government
intends
to
introduce
information
in
a
proceeding
against
them.
they
have
standing.
that
standing
could
include
a
facial
challenge
like
the
one
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
if
the
information
were
--
if
anyone
gets
notice,
including
the
client,
then
the
lawyer
would
know,
and
the
lawyer
would
be
in
a
position
at
that
point
to
act.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
certainly
true.
but,
in
addition,
your
honor,
the
statute
provides
that
electronic
communication
service
providers
can
challenge
authorizations
under
the
act,
so
you
--
there
certainly
would
be
standing
in
that
instance.
there
was
such
a
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
the
service
provider
did
object
to
the
immediate
statutory
predecessor
to
the
2008
amendments.
and
the
fisa
court
litigated
that
constitutional
challenge.
so
there's
a
concrete
context
there
in
which
it
arises.
but
even
--
but
beyond
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
that's
right.
the
court
found
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
violation
there.
but
i
think
the
point
here,
your
honor,
is
--
the
key
point
is
this,
that
the
--
in
a
normal
case,
a
plaintiff
would
challenge
the
application
of
the
authority
to
that
plaintiff.
in
a
situation
like
this
one,
we
acknowledge
that
it
may
be
difficult
for
a
plaintiff
to
do
so
because
an
--
a
challenge
to
the
application
gets
into
classified
information
pretty
quickly.
i
think
what
the
respondents
have
tried
to
do
here
is
to
find
a
theory
of
the
case
that
avoids
that
difficulty.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
is
a
possibility.
of
course,
there's
a
procedure
that
the
executive
branch
would
have
to
go
through,
but
that's
a
possibility.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
get
to
that
point,
your
honor,
because
i
do
think
the
key
point
here
is
that
the
respondents'
claims
about
this
statute
depend
on
a
cascade
of
speculation.
this
statute
only
grants
authority.
it
doesn't
command
anything.
and
in
order
for
the
respondents
to
make
a
claim
that
they
are
injured,
in
fact,
by
this
statute--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
think
it's
appropriate,
your
honor,
to
relax
the
article
iii
standing
requirement
of
injury
in
fact
based
on
the
reality
that
the
specific
applications
of
this
statute
may
involve
classified
information.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
the
court's
authority
cannot
be
invoked
in
that
circumstance.
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
specific
application
requires
getting
into
classified
matters
can't
change
that
basic
article
iii
requirement.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
the
key
point,
i
think,
is
narrower
than
that,
justice
kennedy.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
speculation
is
about
the
government's
conduct,
not
the
connection
between
the
government
action
and
an
ultimate
effect
on
the
plaintiff.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
government
conduct
being
challenged
has
to
either
have
occurred
or
be
certainly
impending.
and
here,
we
have
the
polar
opposite,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
important
to
think
about--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--certainly
impending.
that's
the
language
from
this
court's
opinions.
and
i
think
--
i
think,
if
the
court
thinks
about
it,
every
single
case
in
which
the
court
has
found
standing,
there's
never
been
a
dispute
about
whether
the
government
was
going
to
act
or
not;
the
dispute
was
only
about
the
connection
between
the
government
action
and
the
plaintiff's
injury.
here,
they're
fighting
about
what--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
that's
not
speculative,
justice
ginsburg,
but
what
is
speculative
is
the
connection
between
the
grant
of
authority
and
a
claim
of
injury.
i
do
think
it's
important--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there's
a
cascade
of
speculation--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i'd
like
very
much
to
do
that.
thank
you,
your
honor,
yes.
first,
the
respondents
have
to
speculate
about
what
the
intelligence
priorities
and
objectives
of
the
executive
branch
are.
second,
they
have
to
speculate
about
how
the
executive
branch
officials
are
going
to
exercise
their
judgment
to
translate
those
priorities
into
procedures
and
procedures
that
comply
with
the
statutory
targeting
and
minimization
requirements.
third,
they
have
to
speculate
about
the
independent
judgment
of
an
article
iii
court
assessing
the
lawfulness
of
those
procedures
and
assessing
whether
those
procedures
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
but
that,
your
honor,
is,
i
think,
not
a
fair
assessment
of
the
process.
it's
really
very
much
an
iterative
process
in
which
there's
a
dialogue
between
the
executive
branch
and
the
fisa
court
in
which
the
court
can
demand
more
information,
raise
objections.
those
get
worked
out,
and
then
there's
a
final
order.
so
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
infer
from
the
fact
that
there's
only
one
rejection
that
this
--
that
it's
a
process
that
isn't
rigorous.
but,
in
addition
to
the
speculation
i
just
described,
once
you
get
through
all
that,
you
still
have
to
speculate
about
whether
the
communication
that
--
whether
the
persons
with
whom
the
respondents
are
communicating
are
going
to
be
targeted,
and
that
respondents'
communications
will
get
picked
up
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
may
be
a
harm,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
question
under
this
court's
cases,
your
honor,
is
whether
the
government
is
going
to
take
an
action
that
makes
that
certainly
impending.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
actually,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
that
gets
to
the
last
speculative
inference
that
needs
to
be
drawn
in
order
for
them
to
make
out
their
chain
of
causation,
and
it's
this:
they
have
to
speculate
that
whatever
surveillance
occurs
will
occur
under
this
authority,
as
opposed
to
other
forms
of
lawful
authority
that
they
do
not
challenge.
and
mr.
mckay,
that
situation
is
a
very
good
example
of
this.
we
point
out
in
footnote
11
at
page
32
of
our
brief
that
mr.
mckay
says,
yes,
my
client
was
subjected
to
10,000
inceptions
of
phone
calls,
20,000
inceptions
of
e-mails.
every
one
of
those,
it's
a
matter
of
public
record,
was
under
the
authority
of
fisa
before
it
was
amended
in
2008--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
he's
just--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
you
can't
get
there
without
establishing
that
there's
a
case
of
controversy.
and
they
haven't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
this
case
is
at
summary
judgment
now,
and
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--respondents
moved
for
summary
judgment
based
on
the
declarations
that
they
submitted.
and
the
declarations
that
they
submitted
contain
the
information
i
described.
and
so
the
only
information
that's
in
front
of
the
court
is
making
a
decision
now
is
information
that
that
surveillance
occurred
under
another
authority
that
still
exists
and
could
still
be
applied--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
think
it's
--
i
think
the
problem,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
redressability,
in
that
the
argument
of
the
lawyers
is
that
we
have
a
duty
to
incur
costs
to
avoid
the
surveillance,
but
that
duty
is
triggered
by,
according
to
their
expert
affidavit--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
they
still
have
to
show
a
concrete
application
of
the
authority
they're
challenging.
that's
what
this
court
faces--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
i
don't.
but
--
but
i
do
think
the
redressability
point
is
a
valid
one.
they
have
to
show--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
precisely
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
think,
as
compared
to
--
let
me
make
two
points
about
that.
first,
in
terms
of
the
expansion
of
authority,
yes,
that's
fair
with
respect
to
the
authority
that
existed
immediately
preceding
the
statute.
i
actually
think
--
a
bit
of
context
is
relevant
here
--
that
what
this
statute
was
trying
to
do
is
reset
the
initial
balance
that
congress
struck
under
fisa
in
1978,
when
the
large
majority
of
overseas
communications
were
carried
by
satellite
and,
therefore,
not
within
fisa.
and,
of
course,
what--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
kagan.
i
think
--
this
statute
does
not
regulate
them.
it
confers
authority
on
the
government.
they
take
whatever
precautions
they
choose
to
take
based
on
their
beliefs
about
how
that
authority's
going
to
be
exercised.
that
depends
on
the
speculation
i
described.
what
this
court
held
in
summers
is
that
you
have
to
have
a
concrete
application
of
the
authority
in
order
to
meet
the
minimum
constitutional
requirement
for
article
iii
standing.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
speculation.
i
think
you
do
not
have
a
concrete
application
of
this
authority
against
anyone,
and
therefore
you
cannot
meet
the
basic
article
iii
requirement
of
standing
that's
set
forth
in
summers.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
difference
between
this
case
and
monsanto
illustrates
our
point.
if
the
plaintiff
in
monsanto
had
come
into
court
and
said,
congress
has
enacted
a
statute
that
gives
the
government
agency
the
authority
to
deregulate
genetically
modified
seeds,
we
think
there
is
an
objectively
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
government
is
going
to
exercise
that
authority
to
deregulate
alfalfa--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
then--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--there
is
at
least
two
differences,
justice
kagan,
with
all
due
respect.
first,
there
is
an
exercise
of
the
delegation
of
authority
in
monsanto
that
is
not
present
here.
here,
there
is
speculation
about
how
the
authority
will
be
exercised.
second,
with
respect
to
the
authority,
the
record
in
monsanto
showed
the
seeds
were
in
the
ground,
and
the
only
question
was
a
question
of
scientific
assessment
about
the
likelihood
that
the
plaintiff
farmers'
crops
were
going
to
be
affected,
and
that
was
a
scientific
judgment
based
on
the
pollination
radius
of
the
bumblebee,
whether
it
would
affect
their
crops.
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
speculation
about
how
government
officials
are
going
to
exercise
policy
judgments
to
implement
the
statute
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--if
i
took
precautions,
it
would
be
because
of
a
belief
that
i
had
to
comply
with
an
ethics
rule,
and
the
ethics
rule
would
be
the
cause
of
me
taking
those
precautions.
it
doesn't
change
the
standard.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
hypothetical
is
a
variant
of
exactly
the
argument
that
the
court
rejected
in
summers.
there
isn't
a
concrete
application.
in
summers,
the
court
said,
even
in
a
situation
where
it
would
be
likely
that
some
members
of
the
sierra
club
would
be
affected
by
the
exercise
of
authority
that
the
statute
conferred,
that
you
cannot
--
you
do
not
have
a
case--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--or
controversy
absent
the
exercise
of
the
authority.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
given
the
availability
of
traditional
fisa
surveillance,
surveillance
under
executive
order
12333,
surveillance
by
foreign
governments,
i
don't
think
it
depends
on
this
statute.
but
--
but,
in
any
event,
whatever
the
reasonable
judgment
of
a
lawyer
in
these
circumstances,
there
isn't
a
concrete
application
of
the
statute
that
creates
a
case
or
controversy
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
do
think
the
problem
here,
justice
ginsburg,
really
is
--
the
heart
of
the
matter
here
really
is
that
in
a
normal
lawsuit
a
plaintiff
would
challenge
the
application
of
a
statute,
of
the
authority
conferred
under
the
statute.
here,
that
would
run
into
classified
information.
so
the
respondents
have
tried
to
plead
a
theory
that
allows
them
to
avoid
that
problem.
but
it
is
inherently
based
on
speculation,
and
i--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--in
a
case
like
that,
the
lawyer
--
the
normal
course
would
be
for
the
lawyer
to
challenge
the
application
of
the
statute.
here,
you
have
the
classified
information
problem.
but
i
will
say--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
they
don't.
and
the
other
thing
i
think
that's
critical
here
is
that
i
think
congress
was
sensitive
to
the
probability
that
you
could
not
have
facial
challenges
of
the
kind
that
respondents
want
to
bring.
and
so
there
is
an
entire--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i'm
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
--
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all,
justice
kennedy.
but
it
remains
the
case
that
the
way
--
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy,
a
concrete
application
of
that
authority
has
to
be
demonstrated
and
it
hasn't
been
under
the
theory
of
the
plaintiffs'
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
--
and
i
think
it
would
be
the
ethics
rule
that
caused
the
lawyer
to
take
those
steps,
not
the
statute.
he
would
still
have
the
same
inferences.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
point,
if
i
could,
justice
kennedy,
that
i
think
goes
to
this
and
then
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
congress
was
aware
of
the
difficult
that
--
of
bringing
facial
challenges,
and
so
congress
put
into
place
an
alternative
structure
of
accountability
here.
there
are
--
this
is
not
unbounded
authority.
there
are
targeting
requirements,
minimization
requirements,
certification
by
the
highest
level
--
highest
levels
of
the
executive,
and
there
is
independent
review
by
an
article
iii
judge
to
ensure
compliance
not
only
with
the
statute,
but
also
with
the
fourth
amendment,
and
there
is
ample
congressional
oversight.
so
it's
not
the
case
that
this
is
a
free-ranging
authority
at
all.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
two
specific
points
and
then
three
broader
points.
first,
justice
kagan,
with
respect
to
the
naomi
klein
declaration,
what
it
says
on
page
338a
is,
"some
of
my
sources
will
decline
to
share
information
with
me
if
they
believe
that
their
communications
are
being
monitored
by
the
united
states.
"
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
you'd
still
have
the
problem
of
speculation
there.
and
if
i
could,
justice
breyer,
go
to
your
proposed
solution.
i
don't
think
it's
a
solution.
i
think
it's
a
mechanism
for
people
who
think
they
may
be
under
surveillance,
foreign
terrorists
who
think
they
may
be
under
surveillance,
to
find
out
whether
they
are
or
not.
i
--
i
just
don't
think
that's
a
workable
solution
at
all.
now,
three
broader
points,
if
i
may.
first,
the
--
in
every
case
in
which
the
court
has
found
standing,
every
one
on
which
the
respondents
rely,
the
government
conduct
either
happened
or
was
certain
to
happen.
in
meese
against
keene,
the
films
had
been
labeled
as
political
propaganda.
it
wasn't
a
question
about
how
authority
to
do
so
would
be
exercised.
in
laidlaw,
the
permit
had
issued,
and
the
pollution
was
in
the
water.
there
wasn't
speculation
about
that.
monsanto,
we
already
talked
about;
the
government
action
was
certain.
that's
true
in
every
case.
and
summers
drew
a
distinction
with
those
cases
because,
in
summers,
there
was
no
example
of
a
concrete
application
of
the
authority.
second,
their
--
the
fact
that
some
of
their
clients
may
take
steps
that
incur
costs
doesn't
change
the
injury.
it's
still
speculative.
it's
the
kind
of
subjective
chill
that
laird
said
was
--
was
not
sufficient
to
establish
standing.
and
i
think,
if
you
take
a
step
back,
think
--
ask
--
think
about
what
they're
asking
you
to
do.
they
are
asking
you
to
invalidate
a
vitally
important
national
security
statute
based
not
on
a
concrete
application--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
the
whole
point,
justice
kagan,
the
basic,
most
fundamental
point
about
the
case
or
controversy
requirement
and
the
injury-in-fact
requirement
that
is
embedded
in
it
is
to
preserve
the
separation
of
powers.
they
are
asking
the
court
to
consider
invalidating
the
statute
based
on
an
assumption
either
that
there
is
dragnet
surveillance
or
an
assumption
that
their
clients
are
going
to
be
put
under
surveillance,
without
a
single
fact
to
substantiate
either
of
those
assumptions.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
would
be--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
talk
about,
your
honor,
because,
to
the
extent
we're
talking
about
the
process
of
acquiring
foreign
intelligence,
that's
a
very
sensitive
intelligence
method;
and,
to
the
extent
minimization
plays
into
that,
it's
--
it's
not
public
information.
but
there
are
some
steps
that
are
publicly
known,
and
they
are,
for
example,
that
information
acquired
can
be
retained
only
for
certain
limited
periods
of
time;
that
whenever
--
when
reports
are
done
on
information,
that
the
names
of
u.s.
persons
or
corporations
are
redacted.
there
are
other
restrictions
on
the
ability
to
use
the
information.
so
there
are
steps
of
that
nature.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
--
again,
your
honor,
there
are
procedures
that
govern
those
issues.
they're
not
public
procedures,
but
there
are
procedures
that
govern
those
issues,
yes.
but
--
but,
i
do
--
i
understand
the
point,
your
honor,
but
i
do
think
that's
why
congress
established
this
alternative
structure
of
accountability,
with
the
statutory
protections,
with
the
<fisa>
[=
fisa]
court
review,
including
review
for
conformity
with
the
fourth
amendment,
with
very
robust
reporting
requirements,
semiannual
reporting
requirements
--
i
see
my
time's
expired.
thank
you.
