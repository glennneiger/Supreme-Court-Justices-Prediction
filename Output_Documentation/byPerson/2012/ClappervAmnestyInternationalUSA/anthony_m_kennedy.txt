justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
test
that
you
propose
that
the
injury
--
i
think
your
brief
used
the
word
imminent
--
is
another
way
of
saying
that
--
is
it
unfair
to
characterize
the
government's
position
as
saying
that
you're
submitting
that
the
injury
must
be
certain?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
lawyer
would
be
--
that
the
lawyer
would
be
injured
if
his
communication
with
the
client
were
intercepted,
or
at
least
that
he
would
have
standing
to
prove
injury.
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment.
if
that
is
an
acceptable
premise,
assume
that
it
is,
are
you
saying
that
it
has
to
be
certain
to
occur?
and
another
test
is
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood,
and
then
we
get
in
the
middle,
is
it
a
substantial
likelihood.
you
have
to
say
--
you
say
imminent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
certainly
impending.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
--
you
were
talking
--
you
wanted
to
say
there's
a
cascade
of
inferences,
i
think
was
your
phrase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
to
tell
us
that
in
your
view
these
--
all
these
inference
that
we're
required
to
go
through,
if
the
respondents'
theory
is
adopted,
you
were
going
to
tell
us
about--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
you're
--
you
are
saying
that
the
government
has
obtained
this
extraordinarily
wide-reaching
power
and
we
have
extraordinary
risks
that
face
this
country
and
the
government's
not
going
to
use
it.
that's
just,
it
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
think
that
the
government
isn't
using
all
of
the
powers
at
its
command
under
the
law--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
order
to
protect
this
country.
and
you
--
you
want
to
say:
oh,
well,
don't
worry
that
it's
not
happening.
there
is
another
statute.
that
--
that's
the
problem
i
have
with
this
line
of
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
justice
kagan's
hypothetical.
the
lawyer
--
and
i
don't
forget
about
the
--
i
think
the
ethics
problem
is,
is
a
very
substantial
one.
i
think
the
lawyer
would
engage
in
malpractice
if
he
talked
on
the
telephone
with
some
of
these
clients,
given
this
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
still
the
reality.
he
still
has
to
change
his
conduct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
both
in
summers
and
monsanto
the
government
tells
us:
we
knew
that
the
governmental
act
was
occurring,
and
then
once
we
knew
that,
the
question
was
substantial
risk.
