hospitals
providing
medicare
services
may
pursue
an
administrative
appeal
from
the
initial
determination
of
the
amount
of
reimbursement
they
qualify
to
receive
from
the
department
of
health
and
human
services.
this
case
concerns
the
time
within
which
the
internal
appeal
maybe
pursued.
under
the
medicare
act,
a
government
contractor,
known
as
a
fiscal
intermediary,
annually
determines
the
reimbursement
amount
due
each
hospital
in
the
intermediary's
area.
a
hospital
that
disagrees
with
the
intermediary
--
intermediary's
calculation,
the
medicare
act
provides
--
may
appeal
to
an
--
to
an
administrative
body
called
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board.
such
an
administrative
appeal,
the
act
specifies,
must
be
brought
within
a
180-day
timeframe.
in
1974,
hhs
adopted
a
regulation
allowing
the
board
to
extend
the
180-day
period
for
a
maximum
of
three
years
if
the
hospital
shows
good
cause
for
the
appeal-filing
delay.
but
three
years
is
it.
the
regulation
wins.
no
appeal
filed
after
that
time
will
be
entertained.
in
2006,
the
board
released
a
decision
in
an
appeal
timely
brought
by
a
hospital
that
is
not
a
party
to
this
case.
in
that
decision,
the
board
determined
that
the
intermediary's
reimbursement
calculation
was
flawed
because
the
government
had
not
given
the
intermediary
the
best
available
data.
many
other
hospitals
were
similarly
disadvantaged
by
the
government's
flawed
calculations
and
likely
had
been
underpaid
for
the
medicare
services
they
provided.
the
hospitals
in
this
case
sought
to
piggyback
on
the
board's
determination
in
the
timely
appealed
case.
their
appeal,
however,
was
brought
more
than
a
decade
after
the
180-day
clock
ran
out.
to
overcome
this
obstacle,
the
hospitals
invoked
a
doctrine
called
equitable
tolling.
“the
clock
should
be
stopped,”
they
urged,
until
the
government's
use
of
faulty
data
came
to
light.
the
board
refused
to
consider
the
untimely
appeals.
under
--
under
the
hhs
regulation,
the
board
observed
three
years
was
the
maximum
stretch
permissible.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed.
there
is
a
presumption,
the
appellate
court
said,
that
equitable
tolling
applies
to
limitation
periods
stated
in
federal
statutes.
under
that
presumption,
the
court
ruled,
it
was
open
to
the
hospitals
to
argue
to
the
board
that
in
fairness,
they
should
be
allowed
to
present
their
long
post-deadline
appeals.
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeal's
judgment.
first,
we
agree
with
both
parties
and
the
dc
circuit
that
the
statute's
180-day
limit
on
provider
appeals
is
not
jurisdictional.
that
is,
it
does
absolutely
preclude
hhs
from
allowing
appeals
once
180
days
runs
out.
but
we
also
hold
that
the
regulation
which
puts
a
firm
three-year
limit
on
late
appeals
was
within
the
bounds
of
hhs'
authority
under
the
medicare
act.
but
we
need
to
type
the
180-day
statute
--
statutory
deadline
jurisdictional,
it
would
mean
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
board
hear
and
appeal
outside
the
180-day
window.
consequently,
hhs'
provision
of
a
three-year
outer
limit
would
fall.
the
language
congress
used
does
not
support
such
an
iron
bar
to
late
appeals.
several
of
our
recent
decisions
confirm
the
directions
like
the
statutory
180-day
limit
are
claimed
processing
rules,
not
jurisdictional
barriers.
there
is
a
next
question
and
it
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
given
that
hhs
could
adopt
the
three-year
for
good
cause
dispensation,
could
the
department
legitimately
say,
“this
much,
three
years,
but
no
more.”
our
answer
is,
“yes.”
the
presumption
of
equitable
tolling
relied
on
by
the
dc
circuit
generally
applies
to
limitations
on
commencing
suit
in
court.
we
have
never
applied
the
presumption
to
an
agency's
deadline
for
appeals
inside
the
agency
and
we
declined
to
do
so
for
the
provider
appeals
that
issued
here.
the
presumption
of
equitable
tolling
is
based
in
part
on
the
premise
that
congress
ordinarily
attends
to
allow
such
tolling,
but
that
premise
is
inept
in
this
context.
the
regulation
as
just
observed,
controls
what
goes
on
inside
an
agency,
not
what
leeway,
a
court
can
allow
when
a
case
travels
from
agency
to
a
court.
the
time
prescription
before
us
has
remained
in
place
for
nearly
40
years.
congress
amended
the
underlying
statutory
section
six
times
in
that
period
without
indicating
any
disapproval
of
the
regulation.
we
further
note
that
unlike
some
administrative
review
--
review
schemes,
the
medicare
provider
appeal
system
applies
not
to
vulnerable
unsophisticated
individuals.
rather,
it
applies
exclusively
to
sophisticated,
well-counseled
institutions,
who
--
who
we'd
like
to
participate
in
the
medicare
system
and
do
so
with
notice
of
hhs'
regulations.
we
hold
in
some
that
the
regulation
at
issue
is
a
permissible
construction
of
the
administrative
appeal
scheme,
congress
enacted,
hence
hhs
acted
within
its
authority
when
it
declared
the
hospitals'
administrative
appeals
time-barred.
the
court's
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
