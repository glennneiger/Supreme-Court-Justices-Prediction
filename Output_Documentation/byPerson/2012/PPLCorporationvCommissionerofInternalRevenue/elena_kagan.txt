mr.
clement--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
mr.
--
i'm
sorry,
please.
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
then
let
me
ask
you
my
question.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
agree
--
i
mean,
you
said
we
should
look
to
the
way
this
is
designed,
so
let's
look
to
the
way
that
the
actual
formula
is
designed.
do
you
agree
that
this
tax
would
impose
identical
tax
liability
for
companies
with
--
at
the
same
average
profits
but
could
impose
very
different
tax
liability
for
companies
with
the
same
total
profits?
that's
the
way
the
thing
is
designed,
is
it
not?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
the
question.
is
that
true
of
every
excess
profits
tax?
take
a
--
a
hypothetical
like
this:
you
have
two
companies,
company
a
and
company
b,
and
one
company
operates
over
four
years
and
makes
a
lot
of
money
and
one
company
operates
over
one
year
and
makes
only
a
quarter
of
that
amount
of
money.
now,
a
typical
excess
profits
tax
is
going
to
take
company
a,
which
has
made
a
lot
of
money,
and
--
and
it's
going
to
end
up
paying
four
times
as
much
tax
as
company
b,
which
has
made
only
a
quarter
of
the
amount
of
money.
but
under
this
tax,
company
a
and
company
b
pay
the
exact
same
thing;
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
one
year
or
four
years?
justice
elena
kagan
in
other
words,
a
company
that
has
made
four
times
as
much
profits
under
this
formula
could
pay
the
same
tax;
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
because
it
was
operating
four
times
as
long.
justice
elena
kagan
and
because
there
is
that
d
variable.
justice
elena
kagan
assuming
the
floatation
value
is
the
same
for
both
companies.
justice
elena
kagan
it
definitely
could.
it
would
have
to.
and
that's
because
what
this
is
trying
to
tax
is
not
total
profits;
this
is
trying
to
tax
average
profits
or
what
may
be
the
better
way
to
say
it,
if
it's
taxing
profitability
and
not
profits.
justice
elena
kagan
but
--
but
the
reason
why
this
formula
was
devised
in
the
way
that
this
formula
was
devised
was
specifically
to
get
at
the
outlier.
in
other
words,
it
was
to
get
at
the
company
that
only
operated
for
a
short
amount
of
time,
but
they
wanted
that
company
to
pay
just
as
big
a
tax
bill
as
the
company
that
had
operated
for
a
much
longer
amount
of
time
and
had
made
many
more
profits.
so
the
end
result
is
that
this
company
that
operates
for
a
very
short
amount
of
time
and
makes
almost
no
excess
profits
pays
the
exact
same
tax
bill
as
a
company
with
four
times
as
much
excess
profits.
justice
elena
kagan
no,
but
even
companies
with
the
exact
same
profits
and
the
exact
same
floatation
value
can
be
subject
to
different
taxes,
and
that's
a
result
of
the
amount
of
time.
that's
a
result
of
the
d
variable.
if
you
were
right--
justice
elena
kagan
--excuse
me.
if
you
were
right,
the
d
variable
wouldn't
exist.
if
this
were
an
excess
profits
tax,
it
would
have
been
written
without
a
d
variable
because
they
would
not
have
cared
whether
it
was
four
years
or
one
year
or
any
place
in
between.
justice
elena
kagan
if
you
were
right,
it
would
just
be
a
52
percent
tax
on
annual
profits
above
1/9th
of
the
floatation
value.
and
it's
not
that.
it's
not
that.
specifically
in
order
to
get
at
railroad
track,
which
would
have
paid
very
little
tax
under
your
formula,
but
instead
pays
a
great
amount
of
tax
because
they
think
that
railroad
track
got
the
same
good
deal
at
the
beginning
as
all
these
other
companies
did,
but
so
even
though
they
didn't
make
much
very
much
in
the
way
of
excess
profits,
they
were
going
to
tax
them
just
as
much.
justice
elena
kagan
you're
not
saying
that
the
amicus
brief
is
wrong.
the
chief
justice
is,
of
course,
right,
the
amicus
brief
is
the
amicus
brief
and
the
amicus
brief
develops
this
argument,
which
i
think
is
the
right
argument.
but
you're
not
saying
that's
wrong.
justice
elena
kagan
because
they're
saying
this
is
not
an
income
for
anybody
because,
in
fact,
this
doesn't
tax
anybody's
income.
it
taxes
annual
--
excuse
me
--
it
taxes
average
profits,
not
total
profits.
it
taxes
profitability
as
a
mechanism
to
tax
value.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
now
i'm
totally
confused,
because
this
outlier
is
an
outlier
not
because
the
tax
hasn't
worked.
it's
an
out
--
it's
an
outlier
that
the
tax
is
designed
to
get
at,
that
this
formula
was
developed
with
this
d
variable
in
order
to
make
sure
that
outliers,
meaning
people,
companies
that
operated
for
only
a
short
amount
of
time
would
still
pay
a
significant
tax
bill.
so
the
whole
design
of
this
tax
was
to
get
at
the
outlier.
that
seems
to
me
to
suggest
that
the
predominant
character
of
the
tax
is
not
an
income
tax
but
is
instead
a
value
tax.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
what
do
you
think
would
--
is
the
answer
--
suppose
that
the
labour
government
had
come
in,
not
after
4
years
but
after
2
years,
that
they
looked
at
those
2
years
of
profits,
they
said
that's
enough
for
us
to
know
that
these
companies
were
grossly
undervalued,
and
they
had
done
this
exact
same
formula,
and
the
result
is
that
they
would
have
ended
up
with
a
tax
rate
of
over
100
percent.
would
that
have
been
creditable
or
not?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
what
the
hypothetical
suggests
is
that
in
some
respects,
the
fact
that
you
now
--
that
you
have
a
tax
rate
here
of
between
zero
and
1
is
a
bit
of
a
fluke.
you
know,
if
they
had
come
in
a
little
bit
earlier
and
done
the
exact
same
thing,
based
on
their
understanding
of
how
profitable
these
companies
were,
which
they
would
have
seen
after
2
years,
you
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
make
the
same
argument.
