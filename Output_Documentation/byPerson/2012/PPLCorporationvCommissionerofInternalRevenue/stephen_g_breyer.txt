justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wanted
--
i
just
wanted
to
hear
what
you
were
going
to
say
in
answer
to
the
second
part
of
justice
sotomayor's
earlier
question.
and
to
remind
you
of
that,
you
were
going
to
explain
to
us,
which
i
felt
i
needed,
the
second
term,
that
second
term.
and
that
just
says
fv
for
value.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
did
notice,
that
if
you
take.23
times
fair
value,
not
quite
by
coincidence,
it
happens
to
be
what
the
companies
would
have
made
over
a
period
of
2
years
in
profit,
had
it
been
the
truth
that
the
value
of
such
companies
was,
as
valued
by
the
market,
9
times
their
earnings.
because
a
company
that's
valued
9
times
its
earnings
earns
about
11
point
something
percent
per
year,
taking
aside
all
other
facts;
and
2
years'
worth
is
that.
and
i
don't
know
if
i've
got
that
part
right,
but
if
i
do
have
that
part
right,
then
what
this
tax
does
is
it
takes
the
profits
the
firms
actually
--
actually
made
over
2
years;
not
quite
actually.
it
assumes
twice
the
--
the
value
of
the
first
year.
you
see,
so
whatever
they
made
the
first
year
--
and
if
it's
only
6
months,
it's
twice
6
months,
you
know
--
that
first
part
figures
out
what
they
really
made
over
the
first
year
and
then
multiplies
it
by
two.
and
you
take
that
and
you
subtract
from
that
the
amount
that
they
would
have
made
over
2
years.
now
--
so
it
looked
to
me
pretty
--
this
helps
you,
of
course,
but
--
but
it
also,
it's
calculated
on
an
average,
the
average
of
the
first
year's
profit,
they
consider
that
the
average;
and
therefore
they
are
right
in
saying,
you
know,
a
firm
that
is
only
in
business
for
6
months
will
be
taxed
--
the
whole
2-year
extra
will
be
taken
away,
even
when
there
was
no
2-year
extra.
you
see,
so
that
firm
would
have
paid
more
than
their
gross
income.
of
course,
there
is
no
such
firm
and
that's
their
problem.
but
we
come
to
that
later.
but
i
want
your
view,
if
you
can
--
if
i've
explained
it
clearly
enough
so
you
get
where
i'm
coming
from.
and
--
and
--
if
--
if
i
have
explained
that
clearly
enough,
i
really
appreciate
what
you
think
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
will
do
that
for
firms
that
are
in
business
for
4
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
absolutely.
it
won't
do
that
for
a
firm
that
was
in
business
6
months.
and
--
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
very
different
number.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
indeed,
a
number
that
could
exceed
the
money
--
all
the
money
they
really
make
in
the
next
2
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
not
true.
there
is
only
one
company
like
that;
absolutely
right.
and
--
but
--
but
some,
particularly
on
the
other
side,
want
to
make
quite
a
lot
out
of
that
fact.
and
they
want
to
make
quite
a
lot
out
of
the
fact
that
for
that
single
--
whatever
it's
called
railroad
something--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
--
i
know
they
didn't.
it
didn't
happen
in
this
instance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
know
what
it
really
was,
i
guess
they're
all
billionaires.
you've
got
triple
billionaires.
i
mean,
if
you
could
go
and
figure
out
what
companies
could
really
be
sold
at
as
opposed
to
what
the
market
says,
i
think
i
have
the
solution
for
you.
i
don't
know
why
either
of
us
is
working
here.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
since
there
is
no
real
value,
i
--
i
mean,
maybe
there
is,
because
they
did
it
in
the
form
of
an
ipo,
and
the
share
then
went
the
next
day
into
the
market,
and
when
the
it
went
the
next
day
into
the
market,
did
the
market
pay
a
lot
more?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
really?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then
you
could
use
that.
you
could
use
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that
relate
to
the
number
9?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes.
but
of
course,
in
the
--
in
the
past,
we
are
making
a
prediction
of
about
what
efficiencies
will
be
realized,
and
in
the
future
we
know.
so
the
one
thing
that
we
don't
know,
since
life
is
risky,
or
we
do
know
for
sure,
is
whatever
it
shows
up
to
be
in
the
future
couldn't
have
been
the
value
that
shareholders
would
have
put
on
it
in
the
past,
because
they
know
life
a
risky.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
that
that
is
relevant
here
of
course
is
this
number
9
is
a
made-up
number.
it
may
be
made
up
by
great
experts,
but
since
they
are
all
not
geniuses
who
are
--
own
the
whole
world,
they
must
not
be
perfect
experts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
that
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
was
a
number
picked
by
whatever
company
had,
what
is
it,
the
--
the
lowest
price
earnings
ratio
or
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
but
that
doesn't
--
that
means
whatever
company
that
the
shareholders
thought
would
deviate
the
least
from
whatever
the
return
was
and
that
doesn't
apply
--
but
you
don't
want
a
lecture
from
me
on
this
subject.
what
i
want
is
an
answer
from
you,
and
the
answer
i
want
from
you
is
this.
as
i
read
it
and
once
understand
that
this
number
is
a
semi
made-up
number,
i
did
look
at
that
second
term
and
i
thought
that.23
times
9
is
about
2
years'
worth
--
about
2
years'
worth
of
profits
that
would
be
expected,
all
things
left
out
of
it
except
profit.
so
then
once
i
saw
that,
i
looked
at
the
first
term.
and
the
first
term
seemed
to
me
to
be
their
actual
profit.
their
actual
profit
on
an
annual
basis
multiplied
by
about
the
same
number,
you
see.
and
so
what
we
do
is
we
take
--
about
multiplying,
see
--
so
we
take
about
two
years'
worth
of
profit
that
they
actually
made
and
we
subtract
from
that
two
years'
worth
that
our
experts
tell
us
they
should
have
made
on
the
basis
of
the
original
market
price.
the
rest
is
excess
profit
and
we
seize
all
of
it.
for
two
years
only.
and
by
the
way,
if
a
company
had
only
six
months'
worth,
well,
then,
you
know,
they
might
really
be
hurt,
because
after
all,
they
only
earned
six
months
at
the
annual
rate
that
showed
something,
and
maybe
they
didn't
really
earn
it
over
the
next
18
months.
but
the
reply
was
there
was
no
such
company.
and,
of
course,
because
time
periods
vary,
rates
will
vary.
but
i
don't
know
that
that
matters
for
an
income
tax.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
rate;
it's
a
question
on
what
you
impose
it.
and
you
impose
it
on
income,
because
as
he
says,
there
are
two
choices
here.
number
is
really
calculated
on
the
basis
of
income
and
there
is
another
number
going
on,
the
actual
floatation
value
and
this
third
thing,
which
is
called
the
number
9.
but
primarily
it
is
the
income
that
makes
the
difference.
now,
that's
his
argument.
what's
your
response?
that's
his
argument
as
i
understand
it.
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
his
mouth.
but
you
--
you
explain
it
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
said,
so
what?
now,
you
can
answer
that
by
saying,
no,
it's
not
so
what.
i
mean,
isn't
an
income
tax
dependant
upon
whether
it's
a
tax
on
income,
not
the
rate?
and
--
and
whether
some
companies
pay
a
high
rate
and
others
pay
a
low
rate,
even
if
that's
totally
arbitrary,
wouldn't
make
a
definition
to
the
characterization.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
long
as
you're
not
--
they
actually
have
the
gross
income
from
which
this
comes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
will.
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait.
it
is
greater
than
the
profit
they
earned
during
the
year,
but
it
is
not
greater
than
the
profit
that
they
earned
during
the
two
years,
or
whatever
the
period
is
that
everybody's
paying
this
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
here,
by
good
luck
for
them
or
bad
luck
for
you
or
whatever
it
is,
they
have
not
taxed
more
than
the
gross
income
of
the
companies.
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--four-year
period.
well,
that's
--
well
--
well,
is
it
not
going
to
be
an
income
tax
if
what
the
u.s.
government
says,
though
it
hasn't
said
it,
it
could
say,
we
want
--
we
want
35
percent
of
what
you
earn
over
six
years.
okay.
that's
what
we
want.
now,
that's
still
an
income
tax,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
say
whatever
--
if
they
impose
it
on
more
than
a
year,
any
country
that
calculates
the
income
tax
over
a
period
for
more
than
a
year
is
outside
the
tax
treaty
because
it's
essential
to
the
nature
of
the
american
income
tax
system
that
it
be
calculated
year
by
year.
you're
hesitating
to
say
that,
but
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
that
--
on
the
question
of
how
to
treat,
i
--
there
isn't
authority
but,
i
mean,
if
i'm
quite
honest
about
how
i
think
about
it,
i
think
the
people
in
the
tax
court
actually
usually
know
more
about
it
than
the
judges
who
are
not
on
the
tax
court.
and
so
when
i
get
an
opinion
and
the
tax
court
all
thinks
one
thing
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
thinking
something
else
and
it's
highly
technical,
i
--
i
tend
to
be
tempted
to
say,
well,
the
tax
courts
deserve
something.
now,
is
there
anything,
really,
or
am
i
just
doing
that
wrong
if
i
did
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
reformulation
--
think
of
--
think
that
first
term.
put
it
in
your
mind.
that
first
term
does
have
a
number
--.23
--
and
let's
do
times
9,
which
is
that
valuation
business.
and
what
you
get
is
a
little
over
2.
okay?
and
you
are
going
to
get
that
every
time.
that's
not
going
to
vary
from
company
to
company.
that
varies
as
long
as
the
universe
is
here.
so
we
know
we're
going
to
multiply.2
--
rather,
2
point
something
times
that
first
part
of
the
first
term.
and
that
first
part
of
the
first
term
consists
of
nothing
other
than,
for
the
four-year
company,
the
average
one-year
profit.
so
the
only
--
what
you
are
telling
people
to
do
in
that
first
term
is
simply
multiply
by
a
little
over
than
2,
a
little
more
than
2,
the
average
profit
earned
over
a
four-year
period.
that's
what
it
says.
so
there
is
nothing
there
but
income.
it's
average
income,
i
grant
you.
but
there
is
nothing
there
but
income.
and
then
what
you
subtract
from
that,
what
you
subtract
from
that
is
a
quarter
--
is
a
quarter
of
the
value,
i
grant
you.
but
it's
a
hypothetical
value
used
with
the
number
9
of
what
one-quarter
of
the
value
of
the
floatation
price
taken
in.
so
there's
an
aspect
to
it
that
does
have
--
unless
you
do
it
the
way
i
was
doing
it
initially,
there
is
an
aspect
to
it
that
does
concern
at
least
a
hypothetical
value.
but
the
heart
of
the
equation
in
determining
this
so-called
present
value
is
nothing
other
than
taking
average
income
over
the
four-year
period.
now,
if
i'm
right
--
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it
is
--
the
very
first
part
of
the
first
part
is
the
profits,
the
average
profit
over
the
four-year
period.
it
says
p.
and
then
p
with
all
this
day
business,
that's
just
times
365
because
they
want
to
annualize
it.
so
if
you
have
a
four
years,
what
you
are
going
to
have
is
you
will
have
365
times
--
and
then
it's
going
to
wipe
out
and
you
will
have
divided
by
4.
so
you
will
take
the
total
profit
over
the
four-year
period,
and
you'll
divide
it
by
4.
that
gives
you
the
annual
profit.
so
now
we
have
finished
the
first
half
of
the
first
part.
and
the
second
half
--
and
we
are
going
to
take.23
of
that.
okay?
no,
we
are
not
going
to
take
any
yet.
taking.23
--
you're
going
to
take.23
of
the
number
9,
and
that
leaves
you
with
the
2
--
that
brings
you
to
the
little
over
2.2.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
we
are
doing
is
taking
the
average
annual
profit
over
a
four-year
period.
we
average
it,
and
then
we
multiply
it
by
two
point
something.
okay?
and
what
that
is
doing
--
then
what
that
is
doing
is
getting
you
just
the
average
annual?
two
years'
worth
of
average
annual.
and
from
that,
we
subtract
a
quarter
of
what
they
received
in
the
initial
price,
which
happens
to
be
what
the
market
--
if
it
really
was
9
--
about
what
it
was
expecting
it
to
earn
during
a
two-year
period.
that's
why
i
put
in
the
last
part.
but
even
if
i
am
wrong
about
that,
i
am
right
about
the
first
half,
aren't
i?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
said
50
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
that
rate
could
be
a
problem
for
somebody
at
some
time
in
some
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wasn't
a
problem
here
because
all
of
these
companies
but
one
did
have
and
did
fit
within
the
four-year
category.
so
as
to
all
these
companies
but
one,
it
did
not
exceed
gross
income;
it
did
not
exceed
net
income;
it
was
50
--
what
the
number
that
he
arrived
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
the
one
year,
you
haven't
calculated
on
one
year,
but
it's
50
percent
of
two
years,
isn't
it?
i'm
sorry,
i
am
now
confused
enough
that
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
have
said
enough
--
my
law
clerks
would
have
picked
this
up.
they
would
have
written
it
down
and
i
will
be
able
to
go
back
with
the
transcript
to
study
it,
which
i
will
do.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why
should
it
be
changed?
i
mean,
why
should
companies,
american
companies
doing
business
abroad,
in
borderline
cases
have
to
pay
tax
on
the
same
income
twice?
