mr.
clement,
is
there
another
example
--
justice
kennedy
mentioned
that
this
was
what
they
call
one-off.
it's
one
time
only
and
it's
retrospective.
is
there
any
instance
in
which
a
foreign
tax
credit
has
been
given
to
something
that
looks
like
this,
a
one-time
only
adjustment
that
is
--
that
operates
retrospectively
on
past
earnings?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
would
--
when
you
would
answer
that
that
the
commissioner
gets
some
credit,
too.
this
is
the
commissioner
--
this
is
a
treasury
regulation.
so
one
question
is:
do
we
owe
that
regulation
any
kind
of
--
any
kind
of
deference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
o'connell
--
if
the
court
should
go
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
went
--
or
the
tax
court
went
--
could
the
regulation
be
changed
so
it
wouldn't
happen
again?
