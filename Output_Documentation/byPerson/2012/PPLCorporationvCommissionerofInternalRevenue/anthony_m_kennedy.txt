suppose
everyone
in
the
case
conceded
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
compensate
the
government
for
having
valued
the
shares
at
too
low
a
price,
and
this
was
stated
right
in
the
enactment.
would
that
change
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
we
think
this
is
both
a
tax
on
profits
and
a
tax
on
low
value,
then
what
do
we
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it's
a
one
--
if
i
could
just
--
suppose
--
we
say,
well
this
is
a
one-time
tax
in
order
to
recalculate,
reassess
the
value.
if
it's
on
income,
it's
still
an
excess
profits
tax
in
your
view.
