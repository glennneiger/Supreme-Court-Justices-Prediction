jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-43,
ppl
corporation
and
subsidiaries
v.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
clement.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'd
really
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wait,
justice
kagan.
no,
justice
kagan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
o'connell?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
had
a
lot
of
--
your
friend
had
a
lot
of
questions
on
the
different
periods,
the
initial
periods
and
changing
the
d
value
and
what
that
did
to
the
--
that
is
not
an
argument
that
you've
made,
is
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
is
--
again,
that's
not
an
argument
you've
made.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
amicus
did,
but
i
don't
think
we
should
do
a
better
job
of
getting
money
from
people
than
the
irs
does.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
that's
a
good
articulation
of
the
argument
you
haven't
made.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
that
argument
was
wrong,
because
you
looked
to
the
predominant
character
of
the
tax
and
that
it's
either
a
tax
--
it's
either
an
income
tax
or
it's
not.
it
wouldn't
be
an
income
tax
on
the
vast
majority
of
the
companies
where
it
was
the
same
and
not
on
the
companies
where
it
was
a
large
value
or
the
other
way
around.
you
look
at
the
predominant
characteristic
and
you
decide
whether
it's
a
tax
or
not
on
that
basis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
is
no
difference
between
what
the
commissioner
says
the
regulation
means
and
what
it
says.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
seem
to
move
the
ball
much
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
--
go
ahead.
what
if
they
impose
this
what
you
would
call
valuation
tax
every
year
and
it
was
based
the
same
way,
it's
based
on
profits
that
year.
saying,
we're
going
to
say,
we
think
the
value
of
this
company
is
now
this
much
because
they
made
--
whatever
--
$20
million
last
year.
and
so
we
impose
this
--
this
set
tax.
the
next
year,
we
think
its
value
is
this
because
they
made,
you
know,
10
million.
so
we
are
going
to
impose
this
tax.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
based
solely
on
the
amount
of
income?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
could
--
a
property
tax
calculated
that
way?
in
other
words,
based
on
income
from
the
property?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
if
they
said,
we
are
going
to
multiply
it
by
a
price/earnings
ratio.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
based
on
how
much
you
earned.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
sounds
like
income.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
“
how
much
you
earned
”
part
sounds
like
income.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-43,
ppl
corporation
versus
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
