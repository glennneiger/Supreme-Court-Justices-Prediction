ms.
ann
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
windfall
tax
is
not
an
income
tax.
it
tax
--
is
a
tax
on
an
increment
of
company
value.
a
company's
profits
multiplied
by
a
price
to
earnings
ratio
is
a
typical
way
of
imputing
a
value
on
a
company.
using
profits
as
one
variable
in
that
valuation
formula
does
not
transform
a
tax
on
company
value
into
an
income
tax.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
justice
scalia,
the
--
what
parliament
was
trying
to
do
here
was
to
impute
a
value
on
the
company
for
which
should
have
been
sold
in
1990.
and
so
using
a
stock
price
at
some
later
date
would
not
have
been
an
adequate
proxy
to
determine
what
that
value
should
have
been.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
the
point
is
that
parliament
was
trying
to
come
up
with
a
value
that
it
should
have
charged
for
these
companies
in
1990,
and,
you
know--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yes,
it
did.
ms.
ann
o'connell
there
--
there
is--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
but
if
you
use--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--if
you
use
just
the
profits
on
the
next
day,
that
wouldn't
capture
all
of
the
efficiencies
that
were
realized
over
the--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
that
is
true.
and
that
is
one
thing
that
is
--
is
the--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--it
is
--
it
is--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--the
number
9
was
not
an
arbitrary
number.
ms.
ann
o'connell
right.
the
lowest
average
price
ratio.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
breyer,
i
think
the
problem
with,
when
we
start
to
reformulate
what
this
tax
is
or
is
not
taxing
or
what
the
amount
of
the
actual
tax
is,
just
shows
the
danger
of
trying
to
reformulate
what
parliament
actually
did
in
trying
to
determine
if
it's
an
income
tax.
as
the
professor's
amicus
brief
points
out,
if
you
reformulated
this
into
an
average
annual
profit
or
left
the
p
over
4
as
it
was,
and
then
divided
everything
else
by
9,
this
would
become
a
207
percent
tax.
ms.
ann
o'connell
in
that
characterization--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--in
that
characterization,
justice
breyer,
the
207
percent
of
average
annual
profits
over
one-ninth
of
floatation
value,
then,
no,
it's
not
an
income
tax
and
the
rate
does
matter
because
it's
completely
confiscatory--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--right.
ms.
ann
o'connell
it's
true.
ms.
ann
o'connell
they
have
not
taxed
more
than
the
total
profits
over
a
four-year
period,
which
is--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
the
u.s.
income
tax
--
what
the
regulation
looks
for
is
taxes
that
have
the
essential
features
of
the
u.s.
income
tax.
and,
no,
the
u.s.
income
tax
has
never
been
imposed
on
a
multiple
of
profit.
it's
--
it's
imposed
as
a
percentage--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yes,
i
am.
i
am.
i
think
if
there
was
a
country
that
imposed
an
income
tax
every
six
years
and
said
every
sixth
year,
you'll
pay
an
income
tax
rate
over
the
last
six
years
and
that
would
probably
still
be
an
income
tax.
but
the
point
is
that
here,
that's
not
anything
close
to
what
they're
doing
or
what
parliament
has
done.
parliament
has
taken
a
valuation
formula
where
it
takes
an
actual
earnings
figure
from
the
company,
an
average
annual
earnings
figure,
and
multiplies
it
by
a
price-to-earnings
ratio
to
impute
a
value
on
the
company.
it
then
subtracts
out
what
it
actually
received
for
the
company,
which
we
think
shows
that
the
substance
of
this
tax
is
that
it's
a
tax
on
an
increment
of
company
value.
parliament
is
calculating
what
it
should
have
sold
the
company
for,
subtracting
out
what
it
actually
received.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that's
right.
i
think
we
generally
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
a
tax
is
--
is
either
an
income
tax
or
not
an
income
tax
for
everybody
that
subject
to
the
tax
and
that
you
look
at
it
in
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
it
applies.
but
i
do
completely
agree
that
the
fact
that
the
d
figure
changes
makes
this
--
just
reinforces
the
idea
that
the
substance
of
this
tax--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--no,
but
our
the
amicus
did
make
it.
i
mean,
that--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
the
point
is
that
--
the
fact
that
there
is
a
d
variable
there
shows
that
what
parliament
was
trying
to
do
was
to
place
an
annual
earnings
figure
on
each
company
to
create
a
value
for
it.
a
company
--
it's
not
similar
to
an
excess
profits
tax
in
that
way,
that
where
a
company
that
operated
for
only
six
months
is
paying
the
tax
at
the
same
level
that
a
company
would
be
that
was
making
profits
at
the
same
rate
for
the
entire
four-year
period.
ms.
ann
o'connell
right.
but
it
--
it
depends
on
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
it
applies.
but--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--it's
not
wrong.
we
think
that
both
the
d
variable
and
the
flotation
value
variable
add
extra
support
for
the
idea
that
this
is
a
tax
on
an
increment
of
company
value.
the
d
shows
that
it's
trying
to
impute
an
annual
earnings
figure
on
each
company.
the
floatation
value
shows
that
it's
not
concerned
just
with
how
profitable
any
particular
company
is,
but
with
how
profitable
it
is
in
relation
to
what
the
uk
government
received
for
it
as
value
when
it
floated
the
company.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that's
right.
but
i'm
not
saying
that
the
--
that
the
argument
the
amicus
are
making
is
wrong.
we're
saying--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that
particular
aspect
of
the
amicus
brief
that
says
if
it's
bad
for
one,
it's
bad
for
all,
yes,
that
is
not
our
position.
it
is
not
our
position;
that
you
look
at
the
tax
based
on
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
it
applies.
so
i
think
we
are
in
general
agreement
with
ppl
that
if
there
are
outliers
where
net
gain
would
be
totally
confiscated,
you'd
look
at
it
in
the
--
in
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
it
applies.
that's
what
the
regulation
says.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
i
mean,
you
could
also
get
to
that
by
saying
that
the
predominant
character
of
this
tax
is
--
is
not
an
income
tax
because
of
the
way
that
it
applies
to
everybody
else.
i
think
that's
our
principal
argument.
if
there
were
some
outlying
companies
for
which
this
didn't
look
like
an
income
tax,
i
think
the
regulation
allows
some
flexibility
there
where
it
says,
we
look
at
it
in
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
it
applies.
and
if
that
makes
it
an
income
tax,
then
it's
an
income
tax
for
everybody.
i
think
an
important
point
here
is
that
the
petitioners
have
conceded
that
if
parliament
had
chosen
a
different
valuation
method,
like
the
stock
price,
for
any
particular
company
and
then
subtracted
out
the
floatation
value,
that
that
would
not
be
a
tax
on
income,
that
that
would
be
a
value
tax.
the
fact
that
parliament
chose
a
different
way
to
place
a
value
on
each
company
shouldn't
become
a
tax
on
income
just
because
profits
is
one
variable
in
that
tax
equation.
that
would
open
up
many
foreign
taxes
that
just
use
this
typical
earnings
times
the
price-to-earnings
ratio
for
an
income
tax
credit,
a
dollar-for-dollar
credit
in
the
united
states,
just
because
the
tax
was
written
that
way.
we
think
what
parliament
was
doing
here
was
clearly
trying
to
impute
a
value
on
each
company,
and
then
subtracting
out
what
it
actually
received.
in
substance,
it's
a
tax
on
value
as
well
as
in
form.
if
the
court
thinks
that
both
of
the
formulas
are
equivalent,
the
tax
that
parliament
actually
wrote
and
the
rewritten
tax
of
51.75
percent
of
your
four
years
of
profits
over
4/9ths
of
the
floatation
value,
then
there
is
a
couple
of
reasons
that
you
should
go
with
the
tax
that
parliament
actually
wrote.
the
first
is
that
exemptions
from
taxation
are
construed
narrowly,
and
a
business
--
a
foreign
income
tax
that
is
paid
through
a
foreign
--
or
i'm
sorry
--
a
foreign
tax
that
is
paid
to
a
foreign
government
that
is
not
an
income
tax
is
usually
just
treated
as
a
deduction.
and
the
irs
has
said
throughout
this
case
that
it
is
perfectly
happy
to
treat
this
windfall
tax
as
a
deduction;
it
just
would
not
get
a
dollar-for-dollar
credit--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
justice
breyer,
with
due
respect
to
the
tax
court,
the
tax
court
didn't
even
analyze
any
of
the
three
regulatory
tests
that
are
set
forth
in
the
regulation.
i--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yes.
i
think,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
ambiguity
about
what
the
regulation
means,
then
the
commissioner's
interpretation
of
his
own
regulation
is
entitled
to
some
order
of
deference
along
the
lines
of
“
our
”
and
our--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that's
true.
well--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that's
true
unless
you
accept
petitioner's
argument
that
what
the
regulation
means
when
it
says
you
evaluate
the
tax
based
on
its
predominant
character
is
that
that
means
you
can
rewrite
the
tax
before
you
start
testing
it
against
the
three
regulatory
requirements,
and
in
which
case,
this
would
be
a
51.75
percent
tax
on
four
years
of
profits
that
you
are
testing
against
the
three
regulatory
requirements.
in
which
case,
yes,
it
would
probably
be
an
income
tax,
but
that's
not
how
the
commissioner
views
the
regulation.
the
commissioner
views
that
predominant
character
test
as:
so
long
as
the
tax
is
predominantly
one
where
you
--
it
is
on
realized
income
and
is
calculated
by
starting
with
gross
receipts
and
subtracting
out
costs
and
expenses,
there
can
be
minor,
nonconforming
elements
in
the
tax
base
--
like
the
inclusion
of
imputed
rental
income
that
is
not
actually
earned
by
a
taxpayer,
which
some
countries
include
in
an
income
tax,
and
the
tax
could
still
be
creditable.
the
predominant
character
does
not
mean
--
the
predominant
character
test
does
not
mean
that
you
completely
rewrite
the
statutory
tax
base
before
you
test
it
against
those
three
regulatory
requirements.
ms.
ann
o'connell
i
think
that
would
not
be
an
income
tax,
because
they
are
using
a
valuation
formula
that
is
imputing
a
value
on
the
company
and
then
taxing
that
value.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
if
that
--
if
that
were
the
only
characteristic,
then
i
think
a
property
tax
that
is
calculated
that
way
could
become
an
income
tax,
and
that's
not
what
the
income
tax
credit
--
the
foreign
tax
credit
is
designed
to
do.
ms.
ann
o'connell
times
the
price-to-earnings
ratio.
if
--
if
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
--
the
tax
that
the
foreign
government
is
imposing
is
just
a
tax
based
on
last
year's
income
and
they
are
calling
it
a
property
tax
or
something
like
that,
i
think
that
is
what
petitioner
was
giving
as
an
example.
that,
i'm
--
i
think,
i
would
think
would
be
an
income
tax.
if
the
only
variable
in
the
tax
base
was
profits,
yes.
i
they--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yes.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yes.
ms.
ann
o'connell
no,
that
sounds
like
value.
and
i
--
and
that's
another
thing--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yes,
but
--
but
any
valuation
formula
will
use
some
known
data
from
the
company
to
determine
a
company's
value.
so
if
you
are
--
if
you
are
applying
just
to
a
company
--
say
that
the
united
states
was
imposing
a
property
tax
on
corporations
and
it
decided
to
calculate
the
value
of
the
corporation
by
taking
its
last
year's
earnings
times
the
price-to-earnings
ratio,
that
could
be
reformulated
to
look
like
a
tax
on
the
company's--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--no,
if
you're--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--first
of
all,
if
the
first
part
of
the
equation
is
--
is
profits
multiplied
by
2,
then
--
then
no.
that
is
not--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--if
you--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
and
i
think
what
you
are
--
the
one
point
of
this
that
is
missing
is:
if
you
are
going
to
multiply
the
other
part
by
2,
you
also
have
to
multiply
the
tax
rate
by
2.
and
if
this
is--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--no,
no,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
100-and-some
percent.
it
would
be
twice
the
51
point--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--it
would
be--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
justice
breyer,
in
your
--
in
your
reconstructed
formula,
the
tax
rate
is
going
to
be
twice
the
51.75
percent.
and
that's--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--yes.
because
you
have
--
if
you're
dividing--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--it's
50
percent
for
all
four
years.
for
one
year,
it's
207
percent.
ms.
ann
o'connell
it's
51.75
percent
for
all
years.
ms.
ann
o'connell
justice
breyer,
i
just
--
i
want
to
address
for
a
minute
the
--
the
issue
that
it
wasn't
confiscatory
of
any
particular
taxpayer's
net
gain.
that's
not
the
relevant
question,
and
i
know
there's
some
discussion
about
this
in
the
brief,
but
if
all
you
were
to
do
were
to
compare
the
final
tax
bill
to
the
company's
net
profits
over
the
year,
there's
a
lot
of
things
that
are
not
income
taxes
that
would
then
become
income
taxes,
like
an
excise
tax
that
is
charged
on
the
number
--
or
the
number
of
products
that
are
manufactured
or
sold
in
a
particular
company
in
any
given
year,
so
long
as
there
--
if
it
leaves
the
taxpayer
with
a
nickel,
then
it's
--
then
that's
an
income
tax.
that's
not
what
the
income
tax
means.
what
matters
is
what
the
tax
base
is.
that's
how
you
determine
if
it's
a
tax
on
income.
the
realization
test
requires
that,
because
you
can't
impose
a
tax
on
income
that
the
taxpayer
hasn't
actually
realized.
and
the
gross
receipts
and
the
net
income
tax
also
require
it.
ms.
ann
o'connell
if
so,
then
i
--
i
think
it
should
be
changed.
and
i
don't
know
exactly
how
that
would
look,
but
maybe
it
could
make
it
more
clear
that
you're
supposed
to
just
look
at
the
tax
base
--
i
think
the
regulation
does
say
that.
but
yes,
i
think
there
would
be
room
for
--
for
the
irs
to
--
to
make
the
regulation
even
more
clear
than
it
already
is,
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
windfall
tax
is
an
income
tax.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
justice
breyer,
they're
not.
sweb,
the
subsidiary
of
petitioner,
paid
the
british
income
tax
in
the
same
years
that
it
paid
this
windfall
tax,
in
1997
and
1998.
and
petitioner
got
a
dollar-for-dollar
foreign
tax
credit
for
its
portion
of
that
british
income
tax
that
was
paid
in
those
years.
for
any
other
tax
that's
imposed
by
a
foreign
government
that's
not
the
income
tax
or
that's
not
an
excess
profits
tax
or
a
war
profits
tax,
the
company
can
get
a
tax
deduction.
that's
how
classes
--
or
other
taxes
are
normally
treated.
you
deduct
from
the
amount
of
income
that
you
are
reporting
to
the
irs
via
the
dollars
that
you
paid
toward
that
foreign
tax,
and
the
--
the
value
of
that
deduction
depends
on
the
marginal
tax
rate
that
the
taxpayer
is
paying.
so
you
might
get
35
cents
on
the
dollar
for
every
dollar
that
you
can
subtract
from
your
income
tax
base.
but
the
dollar-for-dollar
credit
in
section
901
is
reserved
for
foreign
taxes
that
have
the
equivalent
features
of
the
u.s.
income
tax,
and
the
windfall
tax
simply
doesn't.
it's
written
as
a
valuation
formula,
and
it's
not
just
written
that
way,
but
that's
the
substance
of
what
it's
trying
to
do.
it's
imputing
a
value
on
each
company
for
what
the
u.k.
government
should
have
charged,
and
it's
subtracting
out
the
amount
of
money
that
it
actually
received.
and
i
think
that's
an
important
point
to
keep
in
mind
when
determining
what
is
the
--
the
substance
of
the
tax,
is
that
the
u.k.
government
is
not
just
going
out
into
the
world
and
taxing
companies
that
it
thinks
are
particularly
profitable,
to
try
to
get
more
money.
the
u.k.
government
used
to
own
these
companies,
and
it
sold
them
at
too
low
a
price,
and
the
windfall
tax
is
an
effort
to
get
back
some
of
that
value
that
it
should
have
asked
for
when
it
sold
them.
whether
that's
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea,
it's
not
an
income
tax,
in
the
u.s.
sense,
and
it
should
not
be
entitled
to
a
credit
under
section
901.
thank
you.
