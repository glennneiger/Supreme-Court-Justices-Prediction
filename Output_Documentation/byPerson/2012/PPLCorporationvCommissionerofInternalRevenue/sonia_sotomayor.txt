see,
i
have
a
problem
with
this
argument
because
it
assumes
a
way
of
looking
at
this,
but
it's
an
assumption.
you
can
look
at
it
in
either
way.
you
can
look
at
it
as
they
made
too
much
money,
we
want
a
part
of
that
profit
or
they
paid
too
little
for
what
they
got.
and
that
was
the
debate
going
on
in
congress.
did
they
pay
too
little
on
the
floatation
value,
or
did
they
make
too
much
money?
and
what
the
government
says
--
rightly
--
is,
whether
you
paid
too
much
or
too
little
money
depends
on
the
value
of
the
company.
and
one
of
the
factors
that
goes
into
that
is
how
much
money
has
the
company
made?
and
so
you
always
have
to
look
at
profits
to
some
extent.
so
what's
wrong
with
looking
at
it
their
way?
why
does
it
have
to
be
your
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
you
can
only
do
it
your
way
if
you
do
what
the
amici
says,
which
is
to
take
out
from
your
simplified
equation
the
fact
that
the
time
--
the
d
element
of
your
equation
--
is
constant.
you
artificially
freeze
it
at
the
time
at
which
they
operated.
only
by
freezing
that
number
can
you
come
out
with
your
equation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
was
at
least
two
or
three
companies
that
had
a
very
different
period
and
they
paid
a
huge
amount,
much
further
than
their
gross
profits.
because
of
that,
d
changed
for
them.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
change
the
other
part
of
the
equation,
or
the
tax
regulation,
which
says
it
has
to
be
true
for
all
taxpayers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
fear
is,
as
warned
by
the
government
and
the
tax
professors,
that
the
rule
you
want
us
to
announce
to
help
you
win
is
to
say
anytime
a
tax
uses
estimates
of
profits,
no
matter
how
it
does
it,
it
is
credible
--
creditable.
that's
the
rule
you
want.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
isn't
that
to
say
i
want
to
find
the
original
floatation
value,
and
instead
of
estimating
what
the
profits
are,
i'm
simply
going
to
use
the
ones
that
happen?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
is
that
different?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
there
is
an
argument
about
that
because
it
has
two
components
that
you
keep
ignoring:
the
floatation
value
and
the
time
that
the
company--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
problem
with
their
argument,
mr.
clement,
is
that
you
are
undermining
your
own
argument.
if
they
are
getting
three
full
years
at
a
lesser
tax,
it's
because
their
floatation
value
was
made
more
equal
by
this
formula.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
don't
need
to
be
taxed
any
more
moving
forward
because
they
got
it
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
go
back
to
my
initial
question.
what's
the
rule
--
if
someone
uses
your
actual
profits
in
any
way,
it's
a
credit
that
they
are
entitled
to?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
how
you
get
around
it,
because
you
seem
to
be
saying
to
us
that
no
matter
how
--
what
formula
you
create,
so
long
as
we
can
simplify
it
in
math
to
affect
which
--
take
any
variables
in
it
and
fix
them
in
any
way,
that's
a
creditable
tax.
that
seems
to
be
what
your
argument
is.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i'm
saying
to
you
that
any
tax
that
relies
upon
actual
profits
in
any
way,
you
say
is
wrong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
the
floatation
value
is
not
fixed;
it
was
different
for
each
company.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
only
fixed
the
percentage
that
they're
going
to
use,
but
the
actual
amount
paid
was
different
for
every
company.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
accepting
the
position
the
government
made
in
v.
exxon.
you're
not
disavowing
the
position
you
took
there.
