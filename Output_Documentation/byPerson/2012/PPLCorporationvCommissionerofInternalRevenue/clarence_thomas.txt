this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
between
1984
and
1996,
the
united
kingdom
privatized
32
owned
--
state-owned
companies.
many
of
these
companies
became
dramatically
more
efficient
under
private
ownership
and
earned
substantial
profits.
in
1997,
parliament
imposed
a
one-time
“windfall
tax”
on
the
32
companies.
the
tax
was
based
on
the
difference
between
the
actual
price
at
which
each
company
was
privatized
and
a
theoretical
value
arrived
at
by
multiplying
the
company's
historic
profits
by
the
number
nine.
parliament
labeled
this
a
“price-to-earnings
ratio.”
petitioner,
ppl
corporation,
owned
25%
of
the
u.k.
companies
that
was
subject
--
one
of
the
u.k.
companies
that
was
subject
to
the
tax.
it
claimed
the
credit
for
it
shared
bill
on
its
1997
federal
income-tax
return,
relying
on
internal
revenue
code
section
901(b)(1)
which
provides
that
any
income,
war
profits,
and
excess
profits
taxes
paid
overseas
are
creditable
against
u.s.
income
taxes.
treasury
regulations
interpret
this
section
to
mean
that
a
foreign
tax
is
creditable
if
its
predominant
character
is
that
of
an
income
tax
in
the
u.s.
sense.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
rejected
ppls
claim,
but
the
tax
court
held
that
the
u.k.
windfall
tax
was
creditable.
the
third
circuit
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
treasury
regulation
section
1.901-2
sets
forth
the
relevant
principles.
first,
a
tax's
predominant
character
or
the
normal
manner
in
which
it
applies
is
controlling.
thus,
a
foreign
tax
that
operates
as
an
income,
war
profits,
or
excess
profits
tax
for
most
taxpayers
is
creditable.
second,
the
creditability
of
a
foreign
tax
does
not
depend
on
the
way
a
foreign
government
characterizes
its
tax.
instead,
it
depends
on
whether
the
tax
would
be
an
income,
war
profits,
or
excess
profits
tax
if
the
u.s.
had
enacted
it.
other
treasury
regulations
expand
upon
these
principles,
explaining
that
a
foreign
tax's
predominant
character
is
that
of
a
u.s.
income-tax
if
the
foreign
tax
is
likely
to
reach
net
gain
in
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
it
applies.
net
gain,
also
referred
to
as
net
income
consist
of
realized
gross
receipts
reduced
by
significant
cost
and
expense
attributable
to
such
gross
receipts.
any
foreign
tax
that
reaches
net
gain
or
profits
is
creditable.
applying
these
guidelines,
we
conclude
that
the
u.k.
windfall
tax's
predominant
character
is
that
of
an
excess
profits
tax,
the
category
of
income
tax
in
the
u.s.
sense.
the
commissioner
argues
that
the
windfall
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
difference
between
two
values,
but
it
is,
in
fact,
the
tax
on
the
realized
net
income.
the
substance
of
the
windfall
tax
confirms
this
conclusion.
when
algebraically
rearranged,
the
uk's
formula
demonstrates
that
the
windfall
tax
is
economically
equivalent
to
the
difference
between
the
profits
each
company
actually
earned
and
the
amount
the
government
believed
that
should
have
earned
during
the
relevant
period.
for
most
of
the
companies
subject
to
the
tax,
the
formula
effectively
imposed
a
51%
tax
on
all
profits
above
a
threshold,
a
classic
excess
profit
--
profits
tax.
the
commissioner
also
argues
that
any
algebraic
rearrangement
is
improper
because
u.s.
courts
must
take
the
foreign
tax
rate
as
--
as
written
and
accept
whatever
tax
base
the
foreign
tax
purports
to
adopt,
but
such
a
rigid
construction
cannot
be
squared
with
the
black-letter
principle
that
tax
law
deals
and
economic
reality
is
not
legal
abstractions.
we,
accordingly,
follow
substance
over
form
and
hold
that
the
windfall
tax
is
a
tax
on
actual
profits
above
a
threshold
and
is
therefore
creditable.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
reversed.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
