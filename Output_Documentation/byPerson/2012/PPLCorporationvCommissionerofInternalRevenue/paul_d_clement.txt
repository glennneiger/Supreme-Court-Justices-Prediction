mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
has
its
origins
in
a
decision
by
the
british
government
in
the
major
thatcher
years
to
privatize
a
number
of
previously
state-owned
utilities.
the
government's
plan
was
to
keep
prices
constant
and
allow
the
companies
to
make
profits
by
increasing
efficiencies
and
reducing
costs.
only
after
an
initial
period
in
which
prices
would
be
fixed
would
the
prices
be
re-jiggered
and
then
savings
passed
on
to
the
consumers.
now,
this
in
practice
worked
very
well
for
the
companies.
they
were
able
to
increase
their
efficiencies
and
cut
costs
to
a
greater
extent
than
people
expected.
this
was
not,
however,
greeted
as
a
uniform
success.
instead,
the
opposition
party
criticized
this,
and
said
that
the
fat
cats
at
the
utility
companies
had
earned
too
much,
and
the
conservative
government
had
made
a
mistake
by
valuing
the
shares
at
ipo
too
cheaply.
and
so
they
promised
as
an
express
election
promise
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
excess
profits
of
privatized
utilities.
and
when
elected,
they
made
good
on
that
promise
and
passed
the
windfall
act--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
it
has
to
be
my
way
because
of
the
way
the
specific
tax
was
designed.
but
the
first--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
your
honor,
we're
not
artificially
freezing
the
number.
the
number,
the
d
--
1461
for
almost
every
company
--
is
itself
part
of
the
statute.
because
they
picked
a
period
by
which
they
were
going
to
measure
the
profit
in
value-making
terms.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
can
talk
about
the
outlying
companies.
they
paid
a
different
effective
rate
because
the
d
was
different.
but
there's
two
important
things
to
remember.
one,
i
believe
it's
common
ground
between
the
parties
that
the
way
you
apply
this
regulation
is
to
look
at
the
tax
in
--
to
use
the
regulatory
phrase
--
in
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
it
applies.
so
i
believe
it's
common
ground
that
you
ignore
the
outliers
anyway.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
that
particular
provision
--
think
of
it
as
like
a
clark
v.
martinez
principle
for
taxes.
they
either
are
creditable
or
they're
not.
that's
what
that
principle
has
been
interpreted
to.
the
case
you
should
look
at
if
you're
really
interested
in
it
is
the
exxon
case,
the
tax
court
where
we
cite
it
in
both
our
briefs.
and
there,
it
was
a
situation
where
again,
a
british
excess
profits
tax,
in
the
main,
it
was
an
excess
profits
tax
on
the
companies
that
were
developing
the
north
sea
oil
field.
but
as
the
tax
applied
to
a
couple
of
companies
that
really
hadn't
gotten
any
oil
out,
it
applied
very
differently.
and
the
tax
court
and
the
government
in
that
case
both
conceded
no,
you
look
at
the
tax
in
its
main
applications.
and
in
those
main
applications,
everyone
concedes
that
this
tax
operates
exactly
like
a
51.75
percent
tax
on
profits
above
a
threshold,
a
threshold
of
four
nights
at
the
floatation
value.
and
that
is
not
an
accident.
that's
not
some
kind
of
tricky
math
thing
that
somebody
pulled
up,
it's
right
there
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
wouldn't,
justice
kennedy,
because
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it's
the
substance
of
the
tax,
not
its
purpose
behind
it
that
matters.
now,
i
do
think
in
this
case,
as
justice
sotomayor
alluded
to,
everybody
in
this
process
really
understood
that
those
were
just
the
flip
side
of
the
same
coin.
you
can
talk
about
the
profits
being
too
high
vis
--
vis
floatation,
you
can
talk
about
floatation
being
too
low
vis
--
vis
the
subsequently
reported
profits.
but
what
makes--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
in
this
particular
case,
you
would
say
it's
creditable,
because
the
only
measure
of
value
here
is
by
looking
at
retrospective
earnings
over
a
4-year
period.
and
the
best
hypothetical
i
can
give
you
is
think
about
a
foreign
government
that
says
we
want
to
tax
the
value
of
corporations,
but
the
way
we
are
idiosyncratically
going
to
measure
value
is
to
look
at
their
earnings
over
the
past
year.
now,
i
would
hope
that
tax
would
be
for
u.s.
substantive
economic
tax
purposes
fully
creditable.
of
course
it's
a
tax
on
income
by
our
eyes.
now,
in
saying
that,
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
other
country
did
something
wrong
or
that's
not
value
in
their
conception.
but
the
whole
point
that
this
court
made
clear
in
the
biddle
case
going
back
75
years
ago
is
when
you're
looking
at
foreign
taxes
for
purposes
of
applying
the
foreign
tax
credit,
you
don't
take
the
foreign
characterizations,
the
foreign
classifications,
as
a
given.
you
look
at
the
substance
of
the
tax
for
our
purposes.
and
if
you
look
--
if
you
apply
that
mechanism
to
this
tax,
this
tax
looks
exactly
like
a
u.s.
excess
profits
tax.
it
is
really--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
and
of
course,
you
could
have
had
a
one
time,
one-off
tax,
to
use
the
british
phrase,
and
you
could
have
taxed
the
difference
between
the
value
at
floatation
and,
let's
say
the
london
stock
exchange
price
at
some
later
point.
and
that
would
have
been
the
normal
estimate
of
value,
and
it
would
not
have
been
creditable
for
a
number
of
reasons.
but
when
you
do
what
this
tax
uniquely
did,
which
is
you
don't
look
at
a
normal
rubric
of
value,
but
you
look
at
a
construct
--
i
mean,
the
very
fact
that
they
had
to
use
the
phrase
“
value
in
profit-making
terms
”
tells
you
something
weird's
going
on
here.
i
mean,
if
they
were
really--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
ginsburg,
i
can't
put
all
the
pieces
of
that
together
and
say
there's
one
case
that
had
all
of
these
various
features,
and
then
it
was
still
creditable.
but
i
don't
think
that
matters.
it's
very
clear
i
think
for
starters
that
the
fact
that
this
is
a
retroactive
tax
is
not
dispositive.
you
look
at
one
of
the
regulatory
requirements,
and
that's
realization.
and
that
treats
an
estimate
of
future
income
generation
very
differently,
because
that
doesn't
involve
a
realization
event.
but
what
the
regulation
says
is
that
the
tax
has
to
be
imposed
upon
or
subsequent
to.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
emphatically
not.
and
let
me
tell
you
why
there
is
no
slippery
slope
here.
first,
the
big
thing
they
want
to
tell
you
is,
this
is
a
normal
way
of
valuation.
and
if
you
allow
this,
then
any
valuation
is
going
to
be
creditable.
that
is
flat
wrong,
and
the
reason
that's
flat
wrong
is
because
almost
every
effort
in
valuation
is
prospective.
if
you
want
to
try
to
value
a
piece
of
property,
you
could
value
it
by
saying,
well,
what
kind
of
rents
can
i
get
on
this
property
and
i'll
discount
them
back
to
net
present
value.
and
i
suppose
you
can
conceive
of
a
property
tax
as
a
tax
on
a
percentage
of
those
projected
future
earnings.
but
you
know
what?
easily
obviously
not
creditable,
because
the
first
requirement
on
the
regulation
is
that
there
be
a
realization
event.
and
when
you're
talking
about
projected
future
income
streams,
there's
no
realization
events.
so
all
of
those
are
off
the
table.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
exactly.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
because
you
never
would
do
that
in
any
normal
valuation.
what
you
would
do
--
occasionally
in
valuation,
you
have
to
go
back
in
time.
this
isn't
the
only
place
in
the
world
that
anybody
said,
i
wonder
what
google's
stock
was
worth,
like,
back
in
the
day.
but
when
you
do
that
for
valuation
purposes,
the
first
rule
of
thumb
is
to
avoid
hindsight
bias.
and
so
this
tax
uniquely
taxes
nothing
but
hindsight
bias.
it's
going
back
to
1990--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
love
to
talk
about
those
other
variables.
the
floatation
value
--
i
mean,
it's
a
tax
between
the
difference
between
--
between
two
variables.
the
reason
i
am
focusing
on
the
value
and
profit
making
terms
is
because
it's
the
larger
of
the
two
numbers
and
the
tax
falls
in
the
difference
between
the
two
and
the
floatation
value
is
basically
taken
as
a
given.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
go
ahead.
i
mean,
i
could
talk
floatation
value
all
day.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes,
and
that's
true
of
every
excess
profits
tax,
your
honor.
what
matters
for
those
tax--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
they
--
they
would
pay
different
taxes.
i
mean,
they
pay
the
same
rate--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
have
the
same
--
they'd
have
the
same
rate.
they'd
have
--
i
mean,
they
have
the
same
calculation,
but
it
would
affect
them
very
differently.
but
in--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
--
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right;
that's
right.
but
of
course
the
floatation
value
is
going
to
play
a
bigger
role
in
the
other
company--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--then
--
then
maybe
it
could,
justice
kagan,
but
let
me
say
two
things
about
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
with
all
due
respect,
it's
taxing
profits
above
a
threshold,
and
the
threshold
is
determined
by
floatation
value.
for
most
companies
that
the
tax
applies,
and
that
is
the
way
you
look
at
the
creditability
of
these
taxes,
you
ignore
the
outlier.
for
most
of
those
companies,
it's
going
to
be
four
nights
of
the
floatation
value.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that's
not
right,
your
honor.
i
--
it
really
is
not.
and
what
they
were
trying
to
do
--
first
of
all,
the
outliers,
the
reason
they
included
them
in
is
they
figured
they
had
to
because
it
fit
within
their
definition
of
the
regulated
companies
they
were
trying
to
catch.
now,
they
knew
they
had
--
and
this
is
only
two
companies
we
are
talking
about
--
they
knew
they
had
a
shorter
period,
so
they
knew
this
would
fall
differently
on
them
as
a
substantive
matter
no
matter
--
no
matter
how
they
did
it.
the
reason
they
didn't
care
much
is
because
those
companies
got
something
that
the
other
companies
didn't,
which
is
they
got
to
operate
for
the
next
three
years
in
a
favorable
regulatory
environment
in
which
no
excess
profits
tax
would
be
imposed
on
them.
so
it
may
look
like
they
have
a
higher
rate,
effective
rate,
under
our
calculation.
they
do
have
a
higher
effective
rate
over
a
--
over
a
relatively
small
amount
over
the
threshold,
but
they
make
that
up,
essentially,
in
the
out-years
because
they
make
money
under
the
favorable
regulatory
regime.
and
again,
the
theory
of
this
is
for
four
years
after
floatation
there
is
a
favorable
regulatory
regime
in
which
they
make
excess
profits.
those
two
companies
get
to
make
money
in
the
out-years,
two,
three,
four,
without
any
excess
profits
because
it
was
really
important
for
them
to
make
this
a
one-off
tax.
but
if
i
can
get
back
to
your
question,
because
there
is
this
phenomenon--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--they
were.
they
weren't
--
but
they
weren't
subject
to
any
tax
for
it.
because
remember,
they
--
this
is
very
important
for
labor.
they
are
coming
in
after
20
years
of
conservative
rule.
they
don't
want
to
be
the
old
labor
party.
they
don't
want
to
put
in
a
new
permanent
tax,
so
they
want
to
do
this
once.
and
so
that
works
great
for
my
clients
because
they
--
they
were
privatized
in
1990.
but
when
they're
doing
this
in
1997,
they
get
a
couple
of
outlying
companies
that
were
only
privatized
in
'96.
so
what
they
do
is
they
hit
them
with
a
reasonably
tough
tax
in
year
one
but
year
two,
three,
and
four
they
were
in
a
favorable
regulatory
environment
and
they
get
no
tax
at
all.
so,
you
know,
don't
--
don't
cry
any
tears
for
them.
now,
the
point
that
i
thought
you
were
going
to
ask
me,
though,
is
even
with
the
companies
with
the
same
denominator,
it
is
true
that
companies
with
the
same
profits
can
be
subjected
to
different
taxes,
but
that's
because
it's
an
excess
profits
tax.
and
that
is
what
is
true
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
that's
only
true
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
i
disagree.
because,
first
of
all,
it's
only
those
two
companies,
from
what
you
said,
is
--
it
could
possibly
be
true.
as
to
the
rest
of
the
companies,
the
reason
that
they
were
trying
to
use
d
is
because
they
were
trying
to
capture
the
excess
profits
during
a
period
in
which
there
is
a
particular
regulatory
environment
with
--
where
they
--
where
they
thought
they
earned
excess
profits.
for
all
of
the
companies
they
reached,
that
period
was
the
d
with
the
exception
of
the
outliers,
and
the
reason
they
had
a
different
outlier
is
because
they
were
recently
privatized.
but
if
you
think
about
the
substance
of
this
tax,
it
is
taxing
--
their
term
--
value
and
profit-making
terms
but
not
any
abstract
profit-making
terms,
profits
over
a
reported
period.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
because
they
had
three
free
years
in
the
out-years.
and
if
you
are
looking
at
how
this
applies,
in
the
normal
circumstances
of
its
application,
then
you
don't
have
the
full
analysis
of
a
railroad
track.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that's
not
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
that's
--
with
all
due
respect,
that's
not
right.
the
floatation
value
is
calculated
the
same
way
for
each
of
these
companies,
and
the
theory
of
why
the
floatation
value
is
too
low
is
the
same
for
all
of
them,
which
is,
under
the
regulatory
policies,
they
are
going
to
hold
the
prices
firm
for
a
four-year
period
and
they
are
going
to
increase
efficiencies
and
reduce
costs,
and
they
are
going
to
make
money.
that
is
supposed
to
incentivize
them
and
then
that's
the
basis
for
all
the
regulatory
policies
going
forward.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
--
i
think
so,
but
i
think
i
get
there
in
a
slightly
different
way,
because
i
guess
i
don't
see
the
natural
relationship
between
the
23
percent
and
the
floatation
value;
but
i
think
i
get
to
a
similar
place.
which
is,
if
you
think
about
it
the
way
that
we
formulate
it,
it's
51.75
percent
of
4/9ths
of
floatation
value.
now,
the
--
the
floatation
value
is
calculated
based
on
the
initial
share
price
plus
the
number
of
shares.
and
the
initial
share
price
for
all
the
electrical
utilities
was
2
pounds
40
pence.
so
it's
just
2
pounds
40
pence
by
however
many
shares
there
were.
okay,
so
that's
floatation
value.
the
--
the
floor
for
the
excess
profits
is
4/9ths
of
floatation
value.
now,
if
you
want
to
get
it
on
an
annualized
average
basis,
and
if
you
want
to
--
you
know,
this
is
at
64a
of
the
petition
appendix
when
the
tax
court
did
it.
but
what
that
means
in
practice
is
this
tax
is
taxing
51.75
percent
of
the
profits
above
1/9th
of
the
floatation--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
--
it
will
give
you
a
different
number.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
not
true.
if
any
company
here
--
of
any
company
here,
that's
not
true.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
railtrack.
but
again,
railtrack
did
not
pay
more
in
taxes
than--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
--
and
--
and
that
is
a
very
important
fact
because
when
you
are
trying
to
figure
out
--
what
--
and
again,
their
regulation
says,
you
look
to
the
application
of
the
statute
in
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
it
applies.
in
the
normal
circumstances
in
which
this
applies,
and
this
is
--
the
parties
stipulated
to,
every
company
paid
less
in
this
excess
profits
tax
or
windfall
tax
than
they
made
in
initial
period
profits.
and
that
is
all
that
really
matters.
they
want
to
focus
on
the
fact
that
well,
for
a
lot
of
these
companies,
the
base
amount
was
larger
than
the
--
than
their
initial
period
profits.
who
cares?
i
mean,
that's
just
an
artificial
number.
this
act--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no.
i
don't
think
so,
because
again--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
it's
not,
justice
sotomayor.
now,
there's
two
things
your
question
i
think
got
to;
one
i
thought
i
already
dealt
with,
which
is
future
valuation
is
not
a
problem.
there
is
no
realization
of
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it's
not
right
or
wrong.
we
would
say
it's
creditable
if
that's
its
predominant
character.
so
if
you
want
to
put
that
as
part
of
a
ten-factor
test
where
past
realized
profits
is
one
of
the
ten
factors,
but
you
also
look
at
real
market
valuation
and
some
other
factor,
then
i'm
probably
going
to
lose.
but
in
this
instance,
the
only
moving
factor,
the
only
thing
that
changes
from
company
to
company
other
than
the
floatation
value,
which
is
fixed,
is
their
profits.
and
nobody
--
you
know,
nobody
doubts--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
but--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
again,
that
is
classic
excess
profits
tax.
so
let
me
try
to
come
at
it
this
way,
which
is
to
say,
suppose
you
had
a
country
that
had
a
tax
that
said,
we
are
going
to
tax
your
value
and
we
are
going
to
measure
your
--
your
--
your
value
based
on
the
income
you
made
in
the
last
year
or
the
last
2
years.
now,
i
would
say
that
that
is
clearly
a
creditable
income
tax.
if
they
said
the
same
thing
--
we
are
going
to
tax
your
value
and
we
are
going
to
calculate
your
value
based
on
your
income
over
the
last
2
years,
but
we
are
going
to
subtract
10
percent
of
your
market
cap
--
that
would
be
an
excess
profits
tax.
the
market
cap
would
be
different
for
every
company,
so
there
would
be
another
thing
that
was
different
for
each
company,
and
the
effective
rate
might
be
different
but
that's
okay
because
that's
how
an
excessive
profits
tax
works.
the
last
thing
i'd
say
before
i
go
sit
down
is
that's
how
the
1917
united
states
excess
profits
tax
worked.
in
1918,
when
congress
said
that
foreign
excess
profits
taxes
are
creditable,
surely
that's
what
they
had
in
mind,
and
this
is
very
similar
to
that
classic,
prototypical
excess
profits
that.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you.
just
a
few
quick
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
just
for
the
record,
if
what
they
really
wanted
to
do
in
the
british
government
was
to
tax
value
as
we
normally
understood
it,
there
was
a
ready
mechanism
available,
the
london
stock
exchange
price.
now
they
want
to
say,
well,
but
we
wanted
to
go
back
and
value
it
in
1990,
but
as
alluded
to,
they
could
have
done
that
because
on
day
one,
there
was
about
a
20
percent
pop
--
to
use
the
ipo
word
--
there's
about
a
20
percent
pop
in
value
at
the
end
of
the
first
day's
trading.
they
could
have
taxed
that.
if
they
wanted
to
be
a
little
less
precise
but
capture
a
little
more
value,
they
could
have
gone
30
days
out
or
60
days
out,
on
the
theory
that
it
took
a
while
for
the
information
to
make
it
in
to
the
market.
that
would
have
been
a
value
tax.
i
wouldn't
be
up
here
arguing
that
it's
creditable.
but
what
they
did
was
something
very
different.
they
used
a
sui
generis,
very
unique
concept
of
value.
not
value
unmodified,
but
value
in
profit-making
terms.
and
not
profit-making
terms
in
some
abstract
sense
that
takes
into
account
future
income
streams,
but
profit-making
terms
as
measured
by
4
years
of
reported
profits
that
satisfy
every
test
of
the
regulation:
they're
realized
profits,
they're
based
on
gross
receipts,
and
they
reflect
exactly
to
the
penny,
to
the
pence,
the
net
income.
that's
what
they
base
this
tax--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
be
here
with
a
more
difficult
case,
justice
kagan.
i
would
love
to
argue
that
that
is
still
creditable,
because
i
think
you
could
live
in
a
country
that
has
an
income
tax,
especially
an
excess
profits
tax
of
a
few
disfavored
industries,
that
has
a
rate
over
100
percent.
but
i
would
run
into
a
regulatory
hurdle,
and
if
i
had
had
that
case,
i
would
have
had
to
challenge
the
regulations.
i
would
have
loved
to
do
it.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
can
i
just
say,
though,
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
fluke,
because
one
of
the
things
that
the
people
that
constructed
this
tax
wanted
out
of
this
tax
is
they
wanted
it
paid.
so
it's
not
a
fluke
that
they
didn't
impose
a
huge
tax
in
excess
of
initial
period
profits
on
any
company,
because
they
wanted
to
make
sure
the
incidence
of
this
tax
was
on
companies
that
could
actually
pay
it.
and
if
you
do
that
based
on
4
years'
of
reported
profits,
you're
pretty
sure
that
people
are
going
to
be
able
to
pay
it.
i
would
like
to
bring
back
to
the
concession
i
think
that
ultimately
was
made
by
the
government,
that
if
a
foreign
government
has
a
tax
on
value,
that
the
only
measure
of
value
is
the
past
years'
reported
income,
that
that
would
be
a
creditable
income
tax.
well,
i
don't
think
it
changes
if
you
multiply
it
by
9.
i
don't
think
it
changes
if
you
divide
it
by
4.
i
don't
think
if
there
is
one
company,
that
you
divide
it
by
1/4
instead
of
4
--
that
any
of
that
changes
the
analysis,
nor
does
it
change
the
analysis
if
you
subtract
out
some
figure
that
represents
a
market
cap
or
initial
floatation
value.
that
would
make
it
an
excess
profits
tax
rather
than
a
simple
income
tax,
and
that
is
what
the
british
government
did.
i'll
just
close
by
bringing
you
back
75
years
to
the
biddle
case.
in
the
biddle
case,
there
was
an
argument
about
a
british
tax,
and
whether
we
should
follow
the
form
of
the
tax
or
the
substance
of
this
tax.
this
court
said
that
we
of
course,
in
looking
at
a
foreign
tax,
don't
bind
ourselves
by
foreign
classifications
or
characterizations.
we
look
to
the
substance
of
the
tax.
in
the
biddle
case,
the
rule
that
you
look
to
substance
not
form
benefited
the
commissioner.
there's
no
reason
for
a
different
rule
when
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot.
thank
you.
