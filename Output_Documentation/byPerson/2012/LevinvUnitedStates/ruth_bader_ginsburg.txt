justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
but
it
says
first
for
purposes
of
this
section.
and
as
i
understand
your
argument,
those
words
don't
count.
in
other
words,
you
would
be
making
--
you
would
interpret
the
statute
the
same
way
if
the
sentence
started
with
the
provisions
of
section
2680(h).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
veterans
administration,
it
doesn't
say
that,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
do
i
understand
the
mechanics
of
this
right
that
if
the
injured
person
sues
the
united
states
directly,
that
suit
would
fail
because
the
battery
exclusion
would
apply,
but
it's
only
by
suing
the
officer,
the
doctor,
and
then
getting
the
united
states
substituted
that
the
battery
exception
is
abrogated;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feldman,
when
the
westfall
act,
which
doesn't
abrogate
the
intentional
tort
provision,
when
that
was
passed,
why
--
was
there
any
reason
why
congress
kept
the
five
or
six
separate
acts
like
the
gonzalez
act,
instead
of
saying,
well,
we
did
this
piecemeal
for
particular
agencies,
and
now
we
were
dealing
with
federal
employees
across
the
board,
so
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
have
these
five
or
six
that
go
another
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shah,
this
is
not
always
the
government's
position.
in
fact,
in
a
brief
to
this
court
in
the
smith
case,
the
government
took
the
position
that
mr.
feldman
is
presenting
to
us.
what
occurred
to
turn
on
the
light
for
the
government
to
see
that
it
was
wrong
in
the
smith
case
and
come
up
with
this
--
the
interpretation
you
are
now
advancing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
--
why
would
congress,
i
mean,
the
veterans
administration
act
came
after
the
four
or
five
others
and
congress
thought
it
was
patterning
that
act
after
the
gonzalez
act.
why
would
congress
want
to
provide
this
battery
remedy
if
a
veterans
administration
medical
person
messed
up
but
not
if
it
was
an
armed
service
doctor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shah,
does
it
make
any
sense
to
distinguish
between
a
medical
malpractice,
negligence,
and
this
un-consented
operation,
to
split
those
two
and
say
the
government
is
liable
for
malpractice
but
not
for
this
un-consented
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
involves
the
interaction
between
two
federal
statutes,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
the
gonzalez
act.
the
tort
claims
act
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
from
tort
suits
subject
to
several
exceptions.
the
exception
key
to
this
case
is
known
as
the
intentional
tort
exception.
it
preserves
the
government's
immunity
from
claims
arising
out
of
among
other
things,
assaults
or
batteries
committed
by
federal
employees.
the
petitioner,
steven
alan
levin
was
injured
during
a
medical
operation
performed
by
a
surgeon
serving
in
the
u.s.
navy.
seeking
monetary
redress,
levin
filed
suit
under
the
tort
claims
act
naming
the
united
states
and
the
surgeon
as
defendants.
he
alleged
that
the
surgeon
committed
a
battery
by
performing
the
operation
despite
levin's
pre-surgery
withdrawal
of
consent.
the
government
moved
to
release
the
surgeon
from
the
suit
so
that
the
united
states
would
be
the
sole
defendant.
it
invoked
the
first
provision
of
the
gonzalez
act,
10
u.s.c.
1089
(a),
which
shields
medical
personnel
serving
in
the
military
from
liability
for
acts
they
commit
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
tort
suits
involving
military
medical
personnel,
thus
must
proceed
if
at
all
exclusively
against
the
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act.
after
the
district
court
released
the
surgeon,
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
levin's
battery
claim.
the
tort
claims
act
afforded
levin
no
remedy,
the
government
argued,
because
the
intentional
tort
exception
contained
in
that
act
bars
battery
claims
against
the
united
states.
to
counter
that
argument,
levin
relied
on
a
later
provision
of
the
gonzalez
act,
section
1089
(e)
which
reads,
“for
purposes
of
the
gonzalez
act,
the
tort
claims
act
acts
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply
to
any
claim
arising
out
of
a
negligent
or
wrongful
act
in
the
performance
of
medical
functions.”
that
provision,
levin
urged,
abrogates
the
tort
claims
act
intentional
tort
exception
when
the
injured
party
alleges
malpractice
by
a
military
doctor.
and
the
abrogation
allows
him
to
seek
damages
from
the
united
states.
the
district
court
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
granted
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss.
those
courts
thought
that
1089
(e),
the
provision
on
which
levin
relied,
served
only
to
buttress
the
immunity
from
personal
liability
extended
to
military
personnel
in
1089
(a)
and
gave
no
green
light
to
levin's
suit
against
the
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act.
we
reverse
and
hold
that
the
gonzalez
act
abrogates
the
tort
claims
act's
intentional
tort
exception
for
claims
alleging
that
a
military
doctor
operated
without
the
patient's
consent,
section
1089
(e)
states
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply.
the
introductory
clause
to
that
provision
simply
limits
the
reach
of
the
“shall
not
apply
instruction”
to
claims
covered
by
the
gonzalez
act,
that
is
claims
against
military
medical
personnel.
we
are
not
persuaded
by
the
government's
contrary
reading
of
1089
(e).
according
to
the
government,
1089
(e)
instructs
courts
to
pretend
that
the
tort
claims
act
intentional
tort
exception
does
not
immunize
the
government
against
liability
for
battery
claims
even
though
the
exception
does
in
fact
provides
such
shelter.
this
--
let's
pretend
reading,
it
seems
to
us
quite
unnatural
that
congress
intended
1089
(e)
only
to
safeguard
the
personnel
immunity
already
extended
to
military
medical
personnel
by
1089
(a).
one
would
expect
congress
to
have
said
just
that
and
surely
not
to
decree
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply.
in
some
because
levin
has
asserted
the
battery
claim
arising
out
of
the
conduct
of
a
military
doctor
covered
by
the
gonzalez
act.
section
1089
(e)
authorizes
levin
to
proceed
against
the
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act
free
from
the
bar
of
the
intentional
tort
exception.
our
decision
reversing
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
is
unanimous
with
one
qualification.
justice
scalia
does
not
join
footnote
six
and
seven
which
contain
citations
to
senate
reports.
