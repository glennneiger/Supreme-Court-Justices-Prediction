justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
law
review
commentaries
and
maybe
in
lower
courts'
opinion,
is
there
--
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
weight
of
authority
is
to
criticize
the
battery-negligence
distinction
as
being
productive
of
litigation
and
not
really
making
a
lot
of
sense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
did
say
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
point
of
the
gonzalez
act,
it
says,
"would
enable
plaintiffs
to
pursue
those
claims
against
the
united
states.
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
you
would
have
been
disappointed
if
we
didn't
ask
you
about
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
--
and
justice
kagan
indicated,
this
wasn't
just
an
aside.
this
was
rather
a
central
theory
for
your
interpretation
of
the
act;
maybe
not
the
only
theory
but
a
central
theory.
