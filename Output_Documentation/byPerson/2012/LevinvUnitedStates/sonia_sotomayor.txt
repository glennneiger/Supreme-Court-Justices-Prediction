justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
by
your
adversary
has
to
do
with
the
incongruity
between
these
claims
and
the
westfall
ruling
by
this
court.
it's
more
a
policy
argument
than
a
language
argument,
but
how
do
you
address
the
fact
that
we
will
be
interpreting
essentially
two
statutes
that
are
almost
identical
but
with
different
conclusions
if
we
were
to
adopt
your
view.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
there
any
--
i'm
sorry.
are
there
any
other
tort
claims
besides
the
lack
of
consent
battery
claim
at
issue
here
that
could
be
encompassed
by
the
intentional
tort
act
as
it
relates
to
medical
malpractice?
let's
assume
that
it's
not
an
operation,
but
sexual
behavior
with
a
patient
in
their
hospital
room,
something
of
that
nature.
is
that
covered
under
the
gonzalez
act
as
a
claim
against
the
united
states?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
exception
you're
talking
about
is
regularly
applied
in
the
lower
courts?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
lower
courts,
this
determination
is
regularly
made?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
need
more
clear
than
(h)
doesn't
apply?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
much
clearer
congress
has
to
get
than
to
say
it's
nullified.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
more
does
it
have
to
say;
the
exception
doesn't
apply
and
then
what's
left.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
what
do
you
do
with
justice
breyer's
point
or
with
your
adversary's
point?
i
know
you'll
tell
us
don't
look
at
the
congressional
record
because
it
suits
you
right
now,
because
when
it
doesn't
you
point
to
it
extensively.
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
veterans
act
record
that
says,
we
are
modeling
ourselves
after
the
gonzalez
act,
including
its
nullification
of
the
intentional
tort?
