chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-1351,
levin
v.
united
states.
mr.
feldman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
on
the
for
purposes
of
this
section.
what
the
section
does
is
provide
that
the
remedy
against
the
united
states
is
exclusive.
but
what
1089(e)
goes
on
to
say
is
that
the
2680(h)
provision
doesn't
apply.
so
i
don't
see
how
that
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
reference
is
to
the
exclusivity,
not
to
the
waiver
of
the
limitation
on
--
on
intentional
torts.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
shah?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
unequivocally
--
we
have
a
lot
of
cases
that
say
you
don't
get
--
you
certainly
get
the
benefit
of
the
unequivocally
standard
when
you
are
talking
about
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
first
instance,
but
you
don't
keep
getting
the
benefit
over
and
over
again
when
you
are
talking
about
in
this
case
an
exception
to
an
exception
to
an
exception.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
was
because
at
that
point
there
was
an
exception
to
the
exception
of
sovereign
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you're
going
even
a
step
further
to
say
you
get
the
benefit
of
the
unequivocal
test
that
you've
set
forth
at
even
the
next
stage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
already
--
you've
already
used
up
your
benefit
of
an
unequivocal
requirement
when
you've
got
the
interpretation
of
the
ftca
itself,
which
is
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
wait
a
minute.
you
agree
with
me
that
you
don't
get
the
benefit
of
your
higher
standard
of
interpretation
with
respect
to
2680(h)?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
then
the
--
then
the
heightened
standard
of
use
sort
of
resurrects
again
when
you
get
to
considering
an
exception
to
2680(h).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
was
successful.
the
court
relied
on
that
argument
several
times
in
its
opinion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
certainly
--
we
certainly
cited
smith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
friend
--
your
friend
says
that
in
smith
--
i'm
sorry
for
the
confusion
--
the
court
addressed
your
argument
on
the
meaning
of
the
gonzalez
act
several
times.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
want
us
to
decide
the
case
with
the
unequivocal
question
before
us,
in
other
words
deciding
whether
that
benefit
to
the
government
applies
in
this
type
of
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
really
upping
the
ante
here,
and
it
may
well
--
i
have
no
idea
why
the
government
took
the
opposite
position
below,
but
that's
--
that's
putting
a
lot
more
at
stake
in
this
case
than
the
particular
statutory
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
feldman,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
feldman,
the
court
invited
you
to
brief
and
argue
this
case
as
an
amicus
curiae,
and
you
have
ably
discharged
that
responsibility,
for
which
the
court
is
grateful.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1351,
levin
versus
united
states.
