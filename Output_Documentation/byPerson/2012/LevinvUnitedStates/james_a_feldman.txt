mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
language
and
structure
of
the
gonzalez
act
demonstrate,
congress
did
not
completely
eliminate
the
long-recognized
tort
remedy
that's
available
to
essentially
everybody
else
in
the
country
when
doctors
perform
surgery
without
a
patient's
consent.
by
abrogating
the
intentional
tort
exception
to
the
ftca
for
the
class
of
cases
covered
by
the
gonzalez
act,
congress
both
preserved
a
remedy
for
the
victims
of
that
tort,
and,
by
virtue
of
the
gonzalez
act's
exclusive
remedy
provision,
they
made
certain
that
the
federal
employees
themselves
would
not
be
sued.
as
everyone
understood
at
the
time
of
the
enactment,
that
was
the
meaning
of
the
terms
of
the
gonzalez
act.
the
act
has
two
clauses,
an
operative
clause
and
an
introductory
clause.
the
operative
clause
says
in
simple
declarative
terms
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
shall
not
apply
to
any
cause
of
action
arising
out
of
a
wrongful
act
or
omission
in
the
performance
of
medical
functions.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
right.
we
--
that
--
the
part
after
the
introductory
clause
says:
"the
provisions
of
the
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply
to
medical
malpractice
cases.
"
and
that
would
make
it
apply
across
the
government
to
any
government
employee
who
is
performing
those
medical
functions.
by
saying
for
purposes
of
this
section,
congress
limited
it
in
accordance
with
the
case
--
the
agency
by
agency
approach
that
it
had
adopted
in
this
area,
and
limited
it
to
just
the
cases
that
are
covered
by
the
gonzalez
act;
that
is,
by
malpractice
that's
committed
by
doctors
of
the
department
of
defense,
the
national
guard,
the
armed
forces
retirement
home,
and
so
on.
and
so
the
--
each
clause
serves
quite
an
important
function.
congress
had
before
the
gonzalez
act
--
they
had
already
passed
the
statutes
dealing,
for
example,
with
the
public
health
service
that's
essentially
written
in
the
same
terms,
with
the
veterans
administration
--
although
part
of
that
would
have
been
added
later
--
with
the
state
department
doctors,
and
so
on.
and
so
they
were
proceeding
on
an
agency-by-agency
basis,
and
the
way
to
accomplish
that
was
to
first
say,
we
--
we
think
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
should
not
apply
to
these
cases,
because
medical
batteries
of
the
sort
that
we
--
as
alleged
in
this
case
are
so
close
to
the
kinds
of
medical
malpractice
cases
that
are
going
to
be
brought
against
the
government
anyhow.
but
then
in
each
statute,
they
say
for
purposes
of
this
section,
because
it's
only
the
agencies,
only
the
personnel
covered
by
those
sections,
and
the
torts
covered
by
those
sections.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
veterans
administration
--
originally,
the
original
veterans
administration
statute,
which
was
from
about
1965,
doesn't
have
this
1089(e)
intentional
tort
exception
at
all
in
it.
but
then
they
added
it
later
about
10
years
after
this
statute,
and
then
they
added
a
provision
that
was
slightly
worded
differently,
but
it
achieves
exactly
the
same
result.
instead
of
saying
for
purposes
of
this
section,
it
says
"by
the
personnel
named
in
section
a,
which
accomplishes
exactly
the
same
thing.
"
and
actually
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
that
statute,
the
senate
report
on
that
statute
quite
clearly
recites
that
congress
understood
that
1089(e),
the
statute
here,
has
exactly
the
effect
that
i
said.
and
they
said,
we
are
modeling
it
on
that
provision,
and
then
they
did
tinker
with
the
wording,
and
there's
actually
no
explanation
for
the
specific
change.
but
it's
not
uncommon
that
in
statutes
that
have
been
reviewed
by
different
committees
and
passed
10
or
12
years
apart,
that
congress
would
have
a
--
they
would
use
slightly
different
language
to
achieve
essentially
the
same
purpose.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
believe
actually
that's
our
--
that's
the
way
we
read
it,
exactly
like
that,
which
is
the
--
by
nullifying
the
intentional
tort
exception
--
what
the
intentional
tort
exception
provides
is
--
actually
what
it
says
is:
"the
provisions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
shall
not
apply
to
any
case
arising
out
of
assault,
battery.
"
and
so
on.
and
by
eliminating
that,
the
provisions
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
are
otherwise
totally
applicable
to
cases
of
medical
battery,
like
this,
or
other
claims
of
intentional
tort.
and
so
for
cases
covered
by
the
gonzalez
act;
that
is,
cases
of
medical
malpractice
committed
within
the
scope
of
employment
by
the
doctors
of
the
certain
specified
agencies
that
congress
has
named
for
those
cases,
there
is
no
intentional
tort
exception,
and
therefore,
you
can
bring
an
action
against
the
government.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
right.
i
mean,
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
section
you
have
to
read
it
in
context.
and
the
fact
is
that
2680
--
the
term
2680(h)
of
title
28
doesn't
appear
elsewhere
in
the
gonzales
act.
and
the
only
work
that
that
provision
does
in
the
law,
section
--
the
intentional
tort
exception,
2680(h)
of
title
28,
the
only
work
that
that
does
is
to
make
the
--
is
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
is
to
make
the
act
inapplicable
to
those
kinds
of
cases.
so
when
they
say
in
simple
terms
that
shall
not
apply,
all
that
could
mean,
all
that
could
possibly
mean,
is
you
eliminate
that
and
then
you
have
the
tort
claims
act
how
it
is.
and
then
what
the
four
purposes
of
this
section
does
is
say,
but
we're
not
doing
that
across
the
board
for
every
federal
employee
everywhere
or
even
every
malpractice
case.
we
are
just
doing
it
for
the
claims
that
are
covered,
for
the
cases
that
are
covered
in
this
section,
for
purposes
of
this
section.
in
this
section,
if
you
look
at
(a)
then,
which
is
the
basic
exclusive
remedy
provision
that
your
honor
mentioned,
what
(a)
does
is
deal
specifically
with
--
with
medical
malpractice
committed
by
doctors
and
personnel.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
the
statutes
have
to
be
construed
differently.
i
mean,
one
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
court's
decision
in
smith
where
it
construed
that
provision
of
the
westfall
act,
it
--
the
court
never
suggested
that
the
language
--
the
part
of
the
westfall
act
whose
language
is
the
same
as
this
supported
its
conclusion
there.
it
was
relying
on
other
provisions
in
the
westfall
act.
in
particular
there
was
a
provision
that
said:
"once
the
government
substitutes
itself
for
the
defendant,
the
case
shall
proceed
subject
to
all
the
exceptions
and
limitations
in
the
tort
claims
act.
"
and
the
court
said:
well,
yes,
that
gives
us
a
clear
understanding
that,
whether
there's
exceptions
or
not,
we
want
that
case
to
proceed
--
to
proceed.
that
provision
isn't
here
in
the
gonzalez
act.
and
there
was
another
provision
in
the
westfall
act
--
in
the
smith
case,
in
the
westfall
act
that
dealt
with
making
a
specific
exception
for
bivens
cases
and
again
that
provision
isn't
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
think
the
reason
is
when
they
were
dealing
in
this
case
with
this
area
in
1976
they
were
dealing
with
a
specific
problem
of
medical
malpractice
and
they
were
looking
at
that
problem,
doctors,
doctors
had
to
get
insurance,
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
that
for
federal
employees.
and
they
--
when
they
focused
on
that
problem,
actually
the
executive
branch
itself
said
in
a
letter
that
was
sent
to
the
senate
committee,
it
said
there's
an
urgent
need
both
to
assure
adequate
remedies
for
tort
victims
and
to
protect
federal
employees.
and
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do
here
and
i
think
you
see
it
throughout
the
gonzalez
act.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
think
the
difference
is
that
here
they
were
dealing
specifically
with
the
problem
of
medical
malpractice.
12
years
later
when
they
got
around
to
the
westfall
act,
they
weren't
looking
at
medical
malpractice;
they
were
looking
generally
at
the
whole
problem
of
government
employees
being
sued
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
westfall
case,
a
problem
that
particularly
affected
actually
lower
level
government
employees
who
it's
clear
couldn't
take
advantage
of
the
discretionary
function
exception.
and
when
they
are
looking
at
the
broad
universe
of
employees,
they
took
a
different
approach
and
decided,
well,
we're
just
going
to
--
some
people
are
just
going
to
be
out
of
luck
because
this
is
the
determination
that
congress
made,
felt
was
appropriate
there.
but
when
it
was
looking
at
the
specific
problem
of
medical
malpractice
in
the
gonzalez
act,
it
definitely
took
the
position,
as
everybody
said
at
the
time
and
as
the
structure
of
the
act
itself
showed,
that
they
wanted
to
preserve
remedies
and
there
are
two
provisions
in
the
westfall
act
that
make
that
clear--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
reason
they'd
want
it
is
this:
in
the
first
situation,
that
really
arose
--
that
problem
came
with
the
tort
claims
act
when
it
was
first
enacted
in
1946.
and
when
congress
was
looking
at
the
universe
of
federal
employees,
they
felt,
and
especially
given
the
law
at
that
time
and
that
continued
really
up
to
the
present,
that
when
a
federal
employee
or
average
federal
employee
for
the
types
of
intentional
torts
that
they
commit,
especially
a
battery,
it's
extraordinarily
unlikely
that
that's
going
to
be
within
that
scope
of
that
employee's
employment.
and
congress
felt,
well,
we
want
to
just
eliminate
that
altogether.
it's
not
just
to
hold
the
government
responsible
for
that
kind
of
a
claim
when
some
federal
clerk
slugs
someone
or
something
like
that,
and
that
was
the
determination
they
made.
when
they
got
around
to
1976
to
dealing
with
the
particular
problem
of
medical
malpractice,
it
doesn't
actually
usually
happen
--
these
kinds
of
claims
don't
arise
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
where
a
doctor
just
grabs
somebody
and
throws
him
physically
into
the
operating
room.
they
happen
when
the
doctor
is
performing
some
procedure
and
performs
a
different
procedure
or
a
procedure
that
was
not
authorized
by
the
patient.
and
that
--
that
is
very
closely
related
to
core
medical
malpractice
claims
of
exactly
the
sort
that
they
were
dealing
with
here.
it's
very
closely
related
to
informed
consent
claims,
which
i
believe
the
government
--
i
read
the
government
to
be
conceding
could
be
brought
against
the
government,
and
they
thought
there
was
no
reason
to
distinguish
--
to
distinguish
one
type
of
medical
malpractice
from
another.
we
want
all
of
these
claims,
we
want
to
provide
a
remedy
and
they
all
should
be
brought
against
the
government.
i
would
add
one
other--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
that
is
fair
to
say,
and,
you
know,
states
--
a
lot
of
states
have
dealt
with
this
by
dealing
in
statutory
--
in
statutes,
not
in
the
common
law
development,
so
they
could
kind
of
rationalize
the
system
and
say,
look,
this
is
the
kinds
of
claims
you're
going
to
have.
but
the
key
thing
is
that
everybody
in
the
country,
i
think,
under
every
state's
law,
if
a
doctor
performs
an
operation
that
you
didn't
consent
to,
you
have
an
action
in
tort.
and
that
protects
both
you
and
provides
an
incentive,
an
important
incentive,
to
doctors
and
medical
personnel
to
be
sure
that
they
are
only
doing
what
they
are
authorized
to
do.
there
is
not
a
hint
that
when
congress
was
dealing
with
the
westfall
act
--
i
keep
saying
the
westfall
act
--
when
congress
was
dealing
with
the
gonzalez
act,
there
is
not
a
hint
that
they
were
trying
there
to
say,
well,
we
want
to
save
money
or
something
by
eliminating
those
kind
of
very,
very
traditional
tort
claims
from
those
victims
and
we
don't
want
those
people
to
have
compensation.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that's
correct.
there
is
nothing
in
this
act
that
says
it
should
make
any
difference.
there
is
nothing
certainly
in
subsection
(e)
or
anywhere
else
in
the
act
that
says
it
should
make
any
difference
whether
you
are
suing
the
government
or
suing
the
--
or
suing
the
doctor.
you
sue
the
government,
the
government
says,
well,
we
have
a
defense
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
applies.
you
would
say,
no,
it
says
here
for
purposes
of
this
section
the
intentional
tort
exception
does
not
apply.
and
what
that
means,
"for
the
purposes
of
this
section.
"
is
for
claims
that
are
covered
by
this
act,
which
is
claims
that
are
medical
tort
claims
brought
against
personnel
of
the
affected
agencies
who
are
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
it
would
be
an
assault
or
battery
that
was
committed
by
--
within
the
scope
of
the
professional's
employment,
then
it
would
be.
but
it's
always
the
question
of
whether
it's
within
the
scope
of
employment.
and
i
think
usually
the
case
law
--
i
mean,
i
think
usually
the
cases
are
that
a
doctor
who
commits
a
sexual
assault
on
a
patient
or
something
is
not
acting
within,
in
the
kind
of
circumstances
you
are
talking
about,
is
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment.
but
that
would
be
a
case-by-case
determination.
there
might
be
some
kind
of
case
where
be.
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
scope
of
employment
determination
is
made
every
day,
because
that
is
made
--
that
is
applicable
throughout
in
any
kind
of
respondeat
superior
situation
whenever
the
employer
of
the
medical
professional
is
sued
and
that
kind
of
thing,
or
nonmedical
professional
for
that
matter.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
and
that
is
actually
one
of
the
two
--
one
of
two
of
the
key
provisions
of
the
act
that
kind
of
establish,
that
could
make
it
very
clear
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
preserve
remedies,
because
in
that
very
provision
after
it
talks
about
removing
when
the
attorney
general
has
certified
that
it's
within
the
scope
of
employment,
it
says:
"the
case
can
be
remanded
if
the
removed
case
is
one
such
that
there
--
that
no
remedy
against
the
united
states
is
available.
"
and
what
that
shows
is
that
congress
knew
that
there
would
be
actions
that
would
continue
to
be
brought
against
doctors
and
they
actually
wanted
to
provide
for
that
right
there
and
say
it
should
be
--
those
should
be
remanded
to
state
court
and
then
they
will
proceed
against
the
doctor
in
state
court.
then
there
is
--
so
that
there
would
be--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would
be
a
case,
for
example--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
it
wouldn't
be
--
if
congress
didn't
have
this
provision
in
the
statute,
it
would
have
been
by
reason
--
that
would
have
been.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
another
one
would
be
a
foreign
tort,
which
is
also
another
exception
under
the
tort
claims
act--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--a
discretionary
function
case,
and
there
are
some
in
the
medical
context.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
or
one
of
the
other
exceptions.
all
of
those
exception
cases,
they
go
on.
they
go
on,
and
congress
could
have
closed
all
of
them
down
and,
in
fact,
if
congress
was
worried
that
there
would
be
--
really,
if
their
sole
purpose
here
was
to
say,
we
don't
want
any
actions
to
be
brought
against
federal
employees,
they
could
have
just
said,
we
don't
want
any
actions
to
be
brought
against
federal
employees.
but
instead,
they
are
providing
for
what
happens
and
for
the
continuation
of
the
action
against
the
doctor.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
would.
i
think
that
because
as
the
court
--
when
the
courts
used,
you
know,
a
number
of
different
formulations
to
talk
about
that
--
i
think
you
are
referring
to
a
kind
of
strict
construction
rule
that
applies
to
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
we
don't
think
is
applicable
here.
but
even
where
that
rule
does
apply,
really
the
question
is,
is
it
a
reasonable
degree
of
clarity
that
congress
intended
to
waive
immunity?
as
the
court
has
said,
is
it
clearly
discernible
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
that
they
intended
to
waive?
and
it
has
to
be
clear,
and
i
think
it
is
clear
here.
and
that
was
what
everybody
at
the
time
of
the
statute
thought.
it's
what
the
government
itself
thought
up
through
the
time
of
the
smith
case,
15--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
so.
i
would
add
that
i
am
not
here
to
defend
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment,
but
i
would
add
that
they
had
a
pro
se
litigant
before
them
and
i
don't
think
they
had
access
to
the
full
degree
of
presentation
that
they
might
have
had
if
it
had
been
more
fully
developed.
but
i
do
think
that
when
the
court
is
making
that
determination
of
what's
clearly
discernible
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute,
the
court
has
also
made
it
clear,
though,
that
what
you
don't
do
is
take
each
word
in
the
statute
and
say,
we're
going
to
take
the
most
pro-government
meaning
of
this
word
and
then
you
add
them
altogether.
what
you
do
is
you
look
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
you
look
at
the
context
of
the
statute,
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
and
then
you
say
what
is
plausible,
what
is
clearly
discernible
from
a
fair
reading.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
can
give
you
the
answer
that
the
government
gave
in
its
brief
in
smith,
which
is
the
gonzalez
act
and
the
other
four
or
five
statutes
continue
to
serve
two,
at
least
two
vital
functions,
and
one
is
specifically
this,
that
they
eliminate
the
intentional
tort
exception
and,
therefore,
allow
relief
for
victims
of
intentional
tort
in
this
medical
malpractice
context
just
like
victims
of
other
kinds
of
malpractice.
the
other
thing
is,
there
are
some
cases,
for
instance,
foreign
torts,
where
there
is
another
provision
of
the
gonzalez
act,
1089(f),
that
provides
for
indemnifying
or
holding
harmless
doctors
when
judgments
are
against
them
in
certain
--
when
there's
a
foreign
tort,
when
a
doctor
has
been
detailed
to
a
nonfederal
agency,
or
if
the
circumstances
are
such
as
are
likely
to
preclude
a
remedy
under
the
tort
claims
act.
so
again,
congress
in
that
--
that
provision
remains
important
because
there
could
be
a
foreign
judgment
against
the
doctor
or
something
even
after
the
westfall
act
and
that
gives
the
authority
to
reimburse
the
doctor
if
the
agency
determines
that
that's
appropriate.
but
that
provision
also
shows
that
congress
intended
that
to
preserve
remedies
here,
because
it
would
have
made
no
sense
for
congress
to
say,
we
want
to
provide
for
the
indemnification
or
reimbursement
of
the
doctor,
if
what
they
really
were
trying
to
do
was
eliminate
all
the
cases
against
doctors.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
and
the
--
and
the
choice
that
congress
had
here
really
was
between
taking
intentional
tort
cases
and
allowing
them
to
be
continued
to
be
brought
against
doctors
and
then
subject
to
this
kind
of
reimbursement
provision
which
they
had
provided
for
or
say,
no,
we
want
these
to
just
be
brought
against
the
government
and
to
protect
the
federal
employees
much
more
fully.
and
so
that
was
the
purpose
of
1089(e)?
they
said,
we
want
to
steer
this
into
the
same
channel
that
all
the
other
malpractice
actions
are
going
into.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
i
mean,
that's
--
that
question
isn't
at
issue
in
this
case.
that
would
really
only
be
directly
at
issue
if
somebody
brought
a
suit
against
the
doctor.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
just
wouldn't
say
it's
irrelevant,
because
what
the
provisions
that
i
have
been
talking
about
show
is
that
congress
--
congress
was
not
trying
in
this
act,
unlike
in
the
westfall
act,
which
doesn't
have
either
of
these
two
provisions,
the
reimbursement
and
remand
provision
that
i've
talked
about
--
unlike
in
the
westfall
act,
congress
wasn't
trying
to
save
money
or
other
--
do
something
else
by
just
eliminating
remedies
for
victims.
it
was
trying
to,
as
the
executive
branch
said,
as
i
said,
to
assure
remedies
for
all
tort
victims
and
to
protect
doctors
in
a
variety
of
different
ways.
and
given
that
that's
what
they
were
trying
to
do
in
the
gonzalez
act,
which
is
clear
from
the
structure,
that
also
helps
clarify
what
1080
or
makes
more
clear
what
1089(e)
means.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
would
add
that,
with
respect
to
the
strict
construction
standard,
i
don't
think
it
does
apply
in
this
context.
the
court
has
never
applied
it
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
context.
in
the
gonzalez
act
1089(e)
specifically
refers
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
it
says
section
2680(h)
of
title
28.
each
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
gonzalez
act
for
their
operation
also
depend
on
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
exclusive
remedy
provision
talks
about
the
tort
claims
act.
the
reimbursement
provision,
the
remand
version,
each
of
them
--
the
whole
statute
is
really
part
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
machinery.
and
when
congress
invoked
that
machinery
here,
i
think
it
knew
and
i
think
it
was
consistent
with
this
court's
precedents
that
the
court
applied
the
same
rule
that
it
applied
in
the
dolan
case,
which
is
construing
the
words
in
accordance
with
their
reason
and
normal
tools
of
statutory
construction
without
a
strict
construction
rule.
although,
as
i
said,
i
do
think
that
it
is
clear
what
the
meaning
of
--
of
the
provision
is
if
you
do
apply
the
rule.
thank
you.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
just
wanted
to
make
a
couple
of
quick
points.
one
is,
the
court
has
not
applied
the
clear
statement
--
the
unequivocal
statement
standard
at
any
time
in
the
tort
claims
act,
not
just
when
it's
dealing
with
exceptions,
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
very
early
cases,
the
aetna
case,
the
yellow
cab
case,
really,
right
after
the
act
was
passed,
you
can
see
that
the
court
is
saying
there,
no,
we
want
to
interpret
this
act
consistent
with
congress's
intent,
the
way
it
wanted
it
interpreted,
which
is
with
a
fair
reading
of
its
words,
not
in
one
direction,
not
in
the
other.
i
just
also
wanted
to
clarify
in
the
smith
case,
because
of
a
possible
misunderstanding.
the
court
definitely
addressed
the
gonzales
act
repeatedly
in
its
opinion
in
the
smith
case,
but
it
didn't
--
the
court
did
not
actually
address
1089(e).
the
reason
the
government,
though,
this
was
important
to
the
government,
and
actually,
the
government's
reply
brief
in
the
smith
case
was,
i
think,
a
hundred
percent
about
the
gonzales
act,
was
that
the
other
side
of
the
gonzales
act
was
saying,
if
you
construe
the
westfall
act
the
way
the
government
wants,
that
will
be
an
implied
repeal,
but
the
gonzales
act
will
have
nothing
left
to
do.
and
it
was
important
for
the
government,
that's
why
they
kept
saying
it,
it
was
important
for
the
government
to
say,
no,
the
gonzales
act
does
have
things
to
do,
this
is
not
an
implied
repeal.
and
one
of
--
of
the
things
it
does
is
exactly
what
we
say
section
1089(e)
does.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you.
