justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
feldman,
as
i
understand
your
argument
and
the
differences
that
you
have
with
the
government,
you
have
one
set
of
differences
about
the
meaning
of
1089(e),
but
then
another
set
about
this
question
of,
if
it
were
true
that
the
government
was
immune
from
suit,
could
you
bring
a
tort
suit
against
the
doctors?
and
the
government
said
--
says
no,
and
you
say
yes,
you
might
be
able
to
do
that.
but
do
you
have
to
answer
that
question
at
all
in
order
to
say
that
you're
correct
on
1089(e)?
justice
elena
kagan
so
there
is
a
lot
of
going
back
and
forth
about
this
question
of
what
would
happen
if
the
government
were
immune,
would
the
individual
doctor
be
immune,
but
that
is
essentially
irrelevant
to
the
question
before
us;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
saying
it
a
different
way,
i
don't
have
to
accept
your
broader
argument.
i
can
remain
ambivalent
about
your
broader
argument
and
still
accept
your
narrower
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
let's
go
back
to
the
text
then,
mr.
shah.
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it
goes
something
like
this.
this
provision
is
there
to
--
to
prevent
people
from
drawing
a
mistaken
inference.
and
the
inference
would
be
that
the
doctors
were
liable
because
the
government
was
not.
now,
there
are
a
thousand
ways
to
do
that
pretty
clearly.
you
could
just
say:
irrespective
of
whether
the
government
is
liable,
the
doctors
are
not,
or
some
such
thing.
justice
elena
kagan
but
instead
what
congress
did
was
it
enacted
a
kind
of
let's
pretend
provision,
right?
let's
pretend
that
the
government
is
liable,
so
then
the
inference
won't
arise.
now,
that
has
to
be
not
just
not
the
best
way
of
achieving
congress's
objective;
it
has
to
be
the
worst,
right?
because
then
you're
raising
the
inference
that
in
fact
the
government
is
liable.
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
do
that?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
saying
something
more
than
that.
justice
elena
kagan
it
could
not
have
written
it
in
a
worse
way.
justice
elena
kagan
but
this
is
not
a
side
issue,
mr.
shah.
in
fact,
you
used
your
understanding
of
1089(e)
as
an
argument
to
produce
the
result
this
court
reached
in
smith.
so
it
was
--
it
was
not
a
very
large
issue,
but
it
was
--
it
was
an
argument.
you
said,
you
know,
we
should
reach
the
results
that
you
wanted
in
smith
because
1089(e)
would
continue
to
have
this
effect.
justice
elena
kagan
it
was
a
supportive
argument.
i
am
not
saying
that
it
was
the
but-for
argument,
but
it
was
clearly
a
supportive
argument
in
your
brief.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
shah,
your
basic
theory
of
the
case,
which
is
that
in
order
to
make
absolutely
certain
that
everyone
gets
the
benefit
of
the
intentional
tort
exception,
both
the
government
and
individual
doctors,
in
order
to
make
that
absolutely
clear,
congress
writes
a
provision
saying
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply.
now
--
i
mean,
the
position,
i
have
to
say,
seems
to
refute
itself.
if
congress
wanted
to
make
absolutely
clear
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
would
apply,
it
wouldn't
have
written
a
provision
saying
that
it
doesn't
apply.
