well,
maybe
we
could
address
this
in
slightly
more
concrete
terms.
you
have
two
--
two
situations.
in
one
case
a
federal
employee
who's
driving
a
car
deliberately
runs
somebody
down;
and
in
the
second
case,
a
government
doctor
grabs
somebody
who
doesn't
want
an
operation
and
performs
the
operation
anyway.
now,
as
--
under
your
reading,
there
would
be
a
claim
against
the
government
in
the
second
situation,
but
not
in
the
first
situation;
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
congress
want
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
the
government
has
an
alternative
interpretation
and
i
know
you
think
it's
wrong,
but
would
you
go
further
and
say
that
it's
not
a
plausible
interpretation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
it
wasn't
the
interpretation
adopted
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
ninth
circuit,
which
you
still
say
is
implausible.
