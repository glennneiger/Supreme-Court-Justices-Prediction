why
would
congress
want
to
treat
them
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
did
they
feel
the
need
here
to
assure
adequate
remedies
for
tort
victims
where
they
did
not
in
the
westfall
act?
i
mean,
you
know,
injured
tort
victims
are
injured
tort
victims.
it
does
seem,
you
know,
rather
odd
that
in
one
instance
congress
would
be
concerned
and
the
other
not
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
the
government
removes
the
case,
it
concedes
that
point,
doesn't
it,
normally?
where
a
case
is
removed
from
state
court,
the
government,
the
attorney
general,
must
certify
that
it
was
within
the
scope
of
employment?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
that
case,
where
no
action
against
the
united
states
is
available?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
by
reason
of
the
battery?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
got
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
--
it's
right
on
the
same
thing.
that
provision
ends,
and
i
am
strengthening
your
last
point.
that
provision
ends:
"if
the
circumstances
are
such
as
are
likely
to
preclude
the
remedies
of
third
persons
against
the
united
states
described
in
section
1346(b)
of
title
28.
"
that
clearly
envisions
that
in
the
ordinary
case
those
remedies
against
the
united
states
would
not
be
precluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
didn't
want
to
say
it
shall
not
apply
for
everything.
it
didn't
want
to
eliminate
the
intentional
tort
exception
for
everybody,
right?
it
only
wanted
to
eliminate
it
for
the
people
covered
by
--
by
the
gonzalez
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
have
said
that,
but
if
it
wanted
to
be
more
parsimonious
in
its
language
it
could
simply
say
for
purposes
of
this
section,
which
section
applies
only
to
these
particular
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
different
congress.
they
don't
always
use
the
same
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
--
you're
lucky
they
even
remember
the
earlier
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
listen,
i
--
you
know,
i
don't
--
i
don't
much
care
about
legislative
history,
but
--
but
if
i
did,
i
wouldn't
think
that
--
that
you
would
say
it
is
patterned
after
another
act
where
you
change
a
very
basic
provision,
whether
suit
can
be
brought
against
the
united
states
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
sort
of
rudimentary
and
fundamental
to
it.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
they
would
say
it's
patterned
after
it.
but,
you
know,
i
--
i
don't
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
thank
you,
dear
colleague.
i
appreciate
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
those
are
the
key
words.
i
think
the
key
words
are
shall
not
apply.
shall
not
apply.
it
isn't
shall
be
deemed
inapplicable.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
a
hypothetical.
it
says
"they
shall
not
apply
to
any
cause
of
action.
"
etc.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
else
was
it
there?
just
for
fun?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
obviously
there
to
support
your
position.
now,
your
position
would
have
been
the
same,
that's
true.
your
position
would
have
been
identical,
but
the
only
purpose
of
that
argument
was
to
support
that
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
find
that
inconsistent
with
the
position
argued.
you
are
talking
about
the
statement
that
the
sole
purpose
was
--
was
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
it
is
the
sole
purpose
even
if
you
accept
your
friend's
interpretation.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
the
sole
purpose
is
to
assure
immunity
to
these
doctors.
now,
in
assuring
immunity
to
these
doctors,
we
are
not
going
to
leave
these
people
without
any
remedy,
and
so
we
allowed
them
a
remedy
against
the
united
states.
that's
subsidiary
to
the
sole
purpose
of
the
act.
sure,
the
sole
purpose
is
to
--
is
to
--
is
to
help
these
doctors.
but
in
order
to
do
it
and
be
fair
at
the
same
time,
you
have
to
allow
suit
against
the
united
states.
i
think
you
could
still
say
the
sole
purpose
was
to
help
the
doctors.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shah,
can
i
ask
you
why,
if
your
interpretation
is
correct,
subsection
(e)
did
not
read
--
not
for
purposes
of
this
section,
but
rather
for
purposes
of
subsection
(a),
the
provisions
of
2680(h)
shall
not
apply?
