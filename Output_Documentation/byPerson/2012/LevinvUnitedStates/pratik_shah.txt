mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
subsection
(e)
of
the
gonzalez
act
states
in
pertinent
part
that:
for
purposes
of
this
section,
which
refers
to
the
gonzales
act,
"the
ftca's
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply.
"
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
those
words
unequivocally
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
medical
battery
claims
like
petitioner's.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
canon
actually
applies
most
strongly
in
this
set
of
circumstances.
and
let
me
talk
about
dolan
and
the
line
of
cases
which
recognizes
a
very
narrow
exception
to
the
normal
presumption
against
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity.
dolan
and
its
predecessor
cases
recognize
that
the
narrow
exception
to
the
canon
when
construing
the
scope
of
exceptions
that
were
enacted
alongside
the
broad
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
ftca
itself.
and
the
purpose
of
drawing
that
exception
to
the
canon
was
it
didn't
want
--
the
court
didn't
want
to
defeat
congress's
purpose
as
manifest
in
the
broad
waiver
itself.
those
exceptions
were
cutting
back
on
the
contemporaneous
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
court
said,
we
don't
want
to
cut
back,
given
the
uniquely
broad
waiver
that
the
ftca
enacts,
the
narrow
rule
exception
limited
to
those
circumstances,
that
hasn't
been
applied
outside
those
circumstances.
unlike
those
cases,
this
case
is
not
construing
the
scope
of
an
exception
that
was
enacted
alongside
the
ftca
that
was
trying
to
cut
back
on
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
to
put
it
more
concretely,
on
the
day
before
the
gonzalez
act
was
enacted,
there
was
no
question
that
sovereign
immunity
barred
the
type
of
claim
at
issue.
that
is,
no
one
had
any
dispute
that
the
ftca's
baseline
of
sovereign
immunity
applied
and
would
have
blocked
this
claim.
the
question
is
whether--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--correct.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
here's--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
we
haven't
used
it
up
because
of
the
scope
of
interpreting
section
2680(h).
you
wouldn't
apply
the
waiver
because
of
the
exception
that
was
enacted
in
dolan.
that's
dolan
itself.
if
we
were
just
talking
about
construing
the
scope
of
section
2680(h)
itself,
i
would
agree
completely
with
you.
what
we
have
here
is
some
years
later
we
have
a
baseline
of
sovereign
immunity.
everyone
agrees
that
the
ftca
and
its
exceptions
have
struck
the
appropriate
balance.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
with
the
respect
to
the
terms
of
2680(h)
as
enacted
at
that
time.
the
difference--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
you
have
a
baseline
of
sovereign
immunity.
what
26
--
in
order
for
--
for
the
other
side
to
prevail,
section
1089(e)
has
to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
it
has
to
--
it
has
to
enact
a
new
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
undisputedly
applied
the
day
before
the
gonzalez
act.
that
is
when
the
canon
should
apply
most
strongly,
when
--
when
the
other
side
is
saying
that
congress--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
if
all
it
said
is
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
does
not
apply,
i
would
agree
with
you
that
that
would
be
enough,
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
said
in
the
1988--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--that
may
well
be
true,
and
congress,
when
it
enacted
the
1988
va
act,
did
it
in
the
most
direct
way.
it
said:
"the
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply
with
respect
to
personnel
employed
by
the
va.
"
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
take
a
step
back.
we
have
four
statutes
starting
in
1965,
then
1976.
the
gonzalez
act
was
part
of
that
chain.
all
four
statutes
in
this
relevant
subsection,
the
analogue,
the
subsection
(e)
here,
said,
"for
purposes
of
this
section,
the
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply.
"
then
we
get
to
1988,
the
last
one
in
the
line,
which
is
the
va
amendment.
it
changes
that
language.
it
eliminates
that
opening
proviso
for
purposes
of
this
section.
the
legislative
history
accompanying
it
says:
look,
we
want
to
allow
intentional
tort
remedies
for
veterans.
it
does
so
--
the
only
reason
i
can
conceive
of
that
congress
would
have
done
it
is
because
it
didn't
think
that
the
prior
four
model
statutes
did
it
clearly
enough.
and
i
think
that
is
the
reason.
and
--
and
if
we
were
in
a
normal
statutory--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
they
used
the
identical
language--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
they
use
the
identical
language
in
every
other
provision
of
that
statute.
they
made
an
affirmative
decision
to
change
the
language
of
subsection
(e).
now,
if
this
were
an
ordinary--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
it
said
the
first
part;
it
did
not
say
the
second
part.
there
is
nothing
in
that
legislative
history
that
says
it
is
--
it
thought
1089(e)
nullified
the
intentional
tort
exception.
it
says
it's
patterned
after
the
gonzalez
act,
and
then
it
changed
the
main
language,
the
opening
proviso
of
that
provision.
now,
if
this
were
an
ordinary
case
of
statutory
interpretation,
this
court
would
have
to
figure
out
whether
by
changing
that
language,
did
congress
just
want
to
tinker
with
the
language
to
clarify
its
intent?
did
it
intend
to
have
a
dispositive
change
by
making
that
change
in
language?
but
this
is
not
an
ordinary
case
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
it
is
patterned--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
patterned
in
the
sense
it
does
use
the
operative
language.
it
takes
out
the
key
opening
proviso,
which
is
the
entire
dispute
in
this
case.
but
legislative
history,
while
it
might
be
important
if
this
were
a
normal
statutory
interpretation
case,
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
you
cannot
look
to
the
legislative
history
to
supply
an
unequivocal
waiver
that
is
not
present
in
the
text
itself.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you
congress
could
have
written
this
provision
in
a
different
way
and
more
clearly.
but
i
think
it's
helpful--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
but
let
me
--
let
me
take
a
step
back
here
on
sort
of
the
landscape
in
which
subsection
(e)
was
enacted.
both
sides
agree
that
without
subsection
(e),
covered
medical
personnel
would
have
faced
the
risk
of
personal
liability
for
medical
battery
claims.
both
sides
also
agree
that
subsection
(e)
was
enacted
to
obviate
that
risk
and
in
fact
successfully
does
so
under
either
side's
construction.
everyone
agrees
on
that.
the
dispute
here
is
whether
congress
accomplished
that
objective
by,
a,
assuming
the
existence
of
an
available
tort
remedy
for
purposes
of
the
gonzalez
act's
conferral
of
immunity,
as
the
text
of
the
provision
suggests,
or
instead
whether
it
takes
the
substantial
further
step
of
actually
amending
the
ftca,
which
is
a
separate
--
an
entirely
separate
statute
and
thereby
provides
a
remedy
against
the
united
states.
the
latter
construction
i
don't
think
is
unmistakably
correct,
it's
not
unavoidable
and
--
and
because
of
that,
the
unequivocal
waiver
requirement
favors
the
government--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no
--
no,
your
honor.
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
you
cannot
look
at
the
legislative
history.
and
the
fact
that
if
you
find
this
confusing--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--justice
breyer,
if
you
find
it's
not--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--unequivocally
clear,
we
win,
and
you
don't
look
to
the
legislative
history
for
clarity.
that's
the
point
of
what--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
the
for
purposes
of
this
section
language
i
think
is
the
key
phrase
and
this
section
refers
to
the
gonzalez
act.
what
the
gonzalez
act
primarily
does,
what
sections
(a)
l
through
(c)
are
all
about,
are
about
conferring
personal
immunity.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i
think
when
we
are
reading
it--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
when
we
are
reading
it
against
the
canon,
the
sovereign
immunity
canon,
i
think
we
would
expect
congress
to
speak
more
clearly.
and
congress
gave
us
two
examples
of
how
it
spoke
more
clearly
in
this
very
context.
one
is
in
1974,
the
sole
--
the
only
time
it
amended
section
2680(h),
it
amended
it
within
the
provision
itself.
that
is,
it
amended
the
language
of
2680(h)
to
add
a
law
enforcement
proviso
that
said,
this
exception
applies
except
with
respect
to
law
enforcement
in
certain
circumstances.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
before
--
before
the
gonzalez
act
came
along,
there
was
a
split
in
the
circuit.
that's
why
the
gonzalez
act
came
along.
there
were
circuits
that
did
not
allow
a
claim
to
proceed
personally
against
the
physician.
there
were
circuits
that
recognized
absolute
immunity
against
a
personal
suit
even
while
it
was
undisputed
that
battery
claim
could
not
proceed
against
the
government.
that
--
and
what
congress
said,
if
you
want
to
look
at
legislative
history,
what
the
senate
report
says
is
in
light
of
this
d.c.
circuit
decision
that
went
the
other
way,
congress
enacted
the
gonzalez
act.
because
it
was
primarily
concerned
about
conferring
personal
immunity.
every
time
the
senate
report
talks
about
the
purpose
of
the
bill
--
it's
on
page
1,
heading:
purpose
of
the
bill
--
it
says
conferring
personal
immunity.
nothing
about
expanding
the
government's
tort
liability.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
sure,
justice
ginsburg.
well,
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
that
section
1089(e)
was
not
directly
at
issue
in
smith
and
the
issue
had
really
been
litigated
quite
sparsely
both
before
and
after
smith.
once
this
case
presented
itself,
the
government
revisited
its
position.
i
think
there
were
two--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
agree
with
that
characterization.
the
government's
argument
would
have
been
identical
with
or
without
1089(e).
but
i
don't
want
to
quibble
about--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
if
you
want
to
read
it
that
way,
i
think
that's
fine.
i
think--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--no,
i
agree.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i
agree--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
the
court--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
but
the
court
did
not
interpret
1089(e).
i
think
smith
--
what
smith
hopefully
said,
your
honor
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
government
revisited
its
position
--
what
the
court
said
in
the
smith
decision
--
you
don't
have
to
take
my
word
of
what
the
legislative
history
says.
what
the
court
in
smith
itself
said
is
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
gonzalez
act
--
not
the
primary
purpose,
not
a
purpose,
not
a
chief
purpose
--
the
sole
purpose
of
the
gonzalez
act
--
and
it's
talking
about
the
gonzalez
act
as
a
whole
--
was
to
confer
personal
immunity
and
not
to
create
malpractice
rights
in
favor
of
plaintiffs.
what
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
it
did
not
address
1089(e)
at
all,
and
i
think
that's
plain
as
day
from
the
opinion.
what
the
court
said
in
smith
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
gonzalez
act,
the
sole
purpose
of
the
gonzalez
act
is
to
confer
personal
immunity,
and
what
it
also
said
is
the
gonzalez
act
does
not
create
malpractice
rights
in
favor
of
plaintiff.
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
government
looked
at
in
reformulating
its
position
and
adopting
its
current
position,
was
the
decision
in
smith,
which
came
after
our
brief.
the
other
thing
we
looked
at--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--you
are
correct.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
you
are
correct.
we
said
it.
this
is
a
change
of
position.
we
revisited
it.
there
were
a
couple
things
we
looked
at
in
coming
to
our--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--again,
i
--
i
disagree
fundamentally
with
that
characterization.
it's
two
sentences
in
our
brief.
it's
at
back-end
of
the
brief.
it
was
not
fundamental
to
the
position
in
smith.
the
court
did
not
rely
on
it
at
all
in
smith.
but
even
if
all
that
were
true,
i
think
the
important
thing
is
why
we
changed
our
position.
the
one
is,
the
first
and
foremost
is
the
statements
in
the
court's
decision
in
smith
itself
which
obviously--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--the
two
statements,
the
sole
purpose
of
the
gonzalez
act
is
to
confer
immunity,
not--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--but,
no--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
the
other
side's
brief
says
all
along
the
sole
purpose
of
this
act
was
not
just
to
confer
personal
immunity,
but
it
had
a
dual
purpose.
the
dual
purpose
was
to
confer
personal
immunity,
and
this
is
time
and
time
again
in
the
other
side's
brief,
to
confer
personal
immunity
and
also
to
provide
adequate
remedies
to
tort
plaintiffs.
that
was
not,
we
submit,
a
purpose,
let
alone
a
primary
purpose--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--of
course,
congress
doesn't
say.
i
think
there
are
two
potential
reasons,
justice
ginsburg.
one
might
be
the,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
special
solicitude
that
congress
pays
veterans,
and
it
may
have
wanted
to
open
up
remedies
to
veterans
that
were
unavailable
to
others.
i
think
the
second
potential
reason
is
the
defense
side
reasons.
the
defendants
in
veterans
act
cases
are
civilian
veterans
administration
employees.
in
a
gonzalez
act
case,
by
and
large
the
defendants
are
going
to
be
active
military
personnel.
congress
is
often
hesitant
to
create
--
expand
judicial
remedies
against
active
military
personnel
because
of
the
risk
it
poses
to
interfering
with
military
function
and
order.
so
i
think
those
are
two
reasons
why
congress
may
have
decided
to
change
course
in
the
veterans
act
in
1988.
after
it
had
four
provisions
that
said
exactly
the
same
thing,
using
the
four
purposes
of
this
act
provision,
it
changed
it
and
it
must
have
changed
it
for
a
reason.
two
potential
reasons
are
to
change
the
result,
which
of
course
under
which
the
government
would
win;
or,
because
it
think
--
it
thought
it
needed
to
speak
more
clearly
in
order
to
waive
sovereign
immunity,
and
under
the
presumption
against
sovereign
immunity
waivers,
the
government
would
also
prevail.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
the
provision
that
you
describe,
justice
kagan,
is
not
this
provision.
it's
the
1988
veterans
act
amendment,
which
says
the
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply.
this
provision
says,
for
purposes
of
this
section,
that
is,
for
purposes
of
the
gonzalez
act's
conferral
of
immunity
in
subsection
(a),
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
shall
not
apply.
now,
sometimes
when
congress
uses
the
four
purposes
of
this
section's
formulation,
sometimes
it
uses
words
like
assume
that
or
consider
that,
as
it
--
as
cited
in

however,
other
times
when
it
uses
for
purposes
of
this
section,
even
though
it
intends
somewhat
of
a
counterfactual
inquiry,
it
eliminates
those
words.
in
title
10
itself,
section
10
usc
335
says
for
purposes
of
this
section.
the
exact
language
is:
"for
purposes
of
this
chapter,
the
term
state
includes
guam
and
the
virgin
islands.
"
now,
there's
no
dispute
that
congress
was
not
trying
to
add
guam
and
the
virgin
islands
as
the
51st
and
52nd
states
of
the
union.
what
it
meant
is,
when
applying
the
provisions
of
this
section
treat
guam
and
virgin
islands
as
if
they
are
states.
so--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
sir.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
it
was
--
it
was
a
common
law
absolute
immunity.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
one
case
is
the
martinez--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--sure.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
the
theory
was--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--the
theory
behind
the
individual
immunity
was
the
same,
essentially
the
same
theory
behind
the
westfall
act
immunity
that
this
court
rejected
in
the
westfall
act
decision.
so
up
until
westfall
there
was
an
argument
that
there
was
absolute
immunity,
that
--
that
the
individual
government
employees
had
absolute
immunity.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
it
was
a
common
law
immunity
that
--
it
was
an
offshoot
of
the
sovereign
immunity,
and
it
conferred
it
on
the
individual
employee.
this
court
of
course
in
westfall
rejected
that
notion
and
said,
you
know,
that
immunity
doesn't
apply
unless
you
are
talking
about
both
being
in
the
scope
of
employment
and
that
apply
--
that
involve
discretionary
policy
decisions
at
a
high
enough
level.
the
last
point
i
would
make,
your
honor,
is,
even
if
you
believed
--
and
i
think
you
do
--
that
the
texts
were
more
naturally
read
to
favor
petitioner,
that
is
not
enough.
and
i
think
you
can
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
nordic
village.
the
statutory
provision
in
that
case
made
certain
bankruptcy
court
determinations
binding
on
the
government
notwithstanding
any
assertion
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
relevant
language
is
reproduced
on
footnote
10
on
page
41
of
our
brief.
that
language,
"notwithstanding
any
assertion
of
sovereign
immunity.
"
sounds
awfully
like
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
seems
pretty
explicit.
but
what
this
court
said
in
applying
the
unequivocal
waiver
requirement
in
finding
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
despite
that
very
explicit
language,
was
that
the
statute
nonetheless
performed
a
significant
function.
here,
the
same
is
true.
section
1089(e),
though
not
authorizing
monetary
relief,
still
undisputedly
performs
a
function
here.
it
performs
a
function
of
securing
the
personal
immunity
conferred
by
section
1089(a),
that
is,
for
purposes
of
the
gonzalez
act,
the
conferral
of
immunity
under
section
1089(a).
just
as
in
nordic
village,
that
is
enough
to
construe
the
statute
against
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
there
are
four
courts
that
have
decided
--
conclusively
spoken
--
to
my
knowledge,
four
courts
in
the
history
that
have
interpreted
this
provision,
section
1089(e).
all
have
come
out
in
the
government's
favor.
there
were
two
district
court
decisions
before
the
smith
case.
both
came
out
in
the
government's
favor.
the
only
two
decisions
i
am
aware
of
are
the
two
decisions
in
this
case,
conclusively
interpreting
1089(e),
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
both
courts
in
this
case
relied
on
the
unequivocal
waiver
requirement.
and
i
think
that
that's
--
it's
not
a
stretch
at
all
to
apply
the
unequivocal
waiver
canon
here.
in
fact,
this
case
is
far
afield
from
dolan.
it
would
be
a
substantial
expansion
of
the
narrow
exception
in
dolan
to
say
that
the
unequivocal
waiver
requirement
didn't
apply.
there
was
no
dispute
that
sovereign
immunity
applied
the
day
before
the
gonzalez
act
was
enacted.
so
the
only
question
is
whether
the
gonzalez
act
enacts
a
new
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
that
is
the
type
of
situation
in
which
the
canon
applies
most
strongly.
and
congress
did
it
in
a
separate
statute.
again,
in
dolan
we
were
interpreting
provisions
that
everyone
agreed
were
part
and
parcel
of
the
ftca
that
--
that
altered
the
balance
of
sovereign
immunity.
here
the
question
is
whether
it
even
affects
or
amends
the
ftca
in
the
first
place,
whether
it
means
to
affect
the
sovereign
immunity
balance
in
the
first
place.
that's
an
especially
strong
case
in
which
we
would
want
an
unequivocal
waiver
requirement.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense,
and
here's
why.
when
congress
enacted
the
intentional
tort
exception
itself
in
1946,
one
of
the
principal
reasons
it
did
that
was
because
intentional
tort
claims
are
sometimes
easier
to
allege
but
more
difficult
to
disprove.
that
is
particularly
true
with
respect
to
these
sort
of
lack
of
consent
claims,
where
you
have
a
patient
who
has
signed
consent
forms,
agreed
to
a
surgery,
and
says
--
and
the
facts
of
this
case
i
think
are
illustrative
--
says
right
before
the
anesthesia
kicked
in,
"i
said
i
don't
want
the
procedure
any
more.
"
now,
here
the
government
was
successful
in
winning
on
summary
judgment
dismissal
of
the
actual
medical
negligence
claim,
that
the
doctor's
standard
of
care
didn't
--
that
the
doctor's
care
didn't
meet
the
standard
of
care.
the
government
won
summary
judgment
on
that
because
there
was
no
evidence,
no
expert
testimony
that
supported
petitioner's
claim.
but
his
claim
that
i
said
no
right
before
the
anesthesia
kicked
in
survived
summary
judgment.
and
i
think
it
was
correct
to
survive
summary
judgment,
but
the
problem
is
that
that
survived
summary
judgment
even
though
the
deposition
testimony,
as
pointed
out
in
the
government's
brief,
everyone
else
in
the
operating
room,
including
the
doctor,
said
that
this
patient
did
not
so
object,
just
shows
that
these
claims--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--may
i
respond,
your
honor?
this
section,
subsection
(a),
(b)
and
(c)
all
work
in
tandem.
(d)
is
a
settlement
provision
that
really
doesn't
really
have
anything
to
do
with
this.
so
when
it
says
for
purposes
of
this
section,
subsection
(a)
and
this
section
are
essentially
the
only
operative
provisions
of
the
act.
the
only
other
provisions
that
do
any
work
are
(e)
and
(f),
which
come
after,
obviously,
subsection
(e).
so
when
congress
used
the
term
for
purposes
of
this
section,
i
think
the
fair
statement
is
it
was
referring
to
subsections
(a)
through
(c).
thank
you.
