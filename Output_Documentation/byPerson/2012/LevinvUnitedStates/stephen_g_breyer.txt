justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
would
--
what
do
you
do,
if
anything,
about
those
of
us,
i
hope
more
than
one,
who
actually
look
at
legislative
history
and
the
house
and
senate
report,
the
senate
report
says
subsection
(e)
would
nullify
a
provision
of
the
tort
claims
act
which
would
otherwise
exclude
any
action
for
assault
and
battery.
then
the
house
says
about
the
same
thing.
so
when
i
look
at
those
two
things,
i
think
the
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
do
just
exactly
what
the
other
side
says:
it
was
to
get
rid
of
assault
and
battery
as
an
exception
and
said
the
government
of
the
united
states
will
pay
for
unlawful
assault
and
battery.
that's
what
the
two
reports
say.
that's
why
they
passed
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you're
--
you're
--
i'm
picking
up
from
--
i
find
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
interpretations
of
legislative
history
very
useful.
so
the
--
the--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
--
the
thing
where
we
are
in
this
--
we
have
a
--
we
have
a
statute,
1089
basically,
and
it
says
you
can
sue
the
government
for
the
tort
of
an
employee.
i'm
oversimplifying,
i'm
oversimplifying.
and
we
should
interpret
that
narrowly,
okay?
we
should
interpret
that
absolutely
has
to
be
definite,
and
it
is
pretty
definite.
now
what
we
have
is
an
exception
to
that.
and
the
exception
is
an
exception
for
battery,
but
not
battery.
can't
sue
the
united
states
for
battery.
and
we're
supposed
to
interpret
that,
i
guess,
as
broadly
as
possible.
if
you
have
a
plausible
argument
that
it
could
be
broader,
you
get
it,
as
long
as
it's
plausible.
then
what
we
have,
because
after
all,
after
these
two
things,
you
can
still
sue
the
person
who
hit
you
over
the
head.
you
can
go
sue
him
in
a
state
court,
can't
you?
now,
oh,
now
we
bring
a
new
act
there.
and
this
new
act
says,
we
are
going
to
have
a
little
exception
to
the
exception.
right?
and
we
are
supposed
to
interpret
that
one,
i
guess,
as
narrowly
as
possible.
so
now,
what
we
are
--
because
that's
an
exception
to
something
which
should
be
interpreted
as
broadly
as
possible
which
is
an
exception
to
something
that
should
be
interpreted
as
narrowly
as
possible.
so
i
think
i
get
it
like
costello
used
to,
i
don't
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
[laughter]
there
are
a
lot
of
words
in
these
things.
and
--
and
so
given
all
these
words
and
--
this
is
where
the
chief
justice
started
--
i
mean,
can't
we
at
least
look
at
legislative
history
to
try
to
figure
out
what
congress
was
doing
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
exception
to
the
exception
to
the
exception?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
you
win
as
long
as
i
find
it
confusing.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
find
it
all
that
confusing.
what
it
says
is
that
this
battery
exception,
which
is
in
(h),
is
not
supposed
to
apply
when
we
look
at
the
military
doctors.
that's
what
it
says.
and
you
say,
ah,
but
it
says
for
purposes
of
this
section.
okay.
i
look
at
for
purposes
of
this
section
and
the
purposes
of
this
section,
the
very
first
whole
sentence
has
to
do
with
1089.
it
has
to
do
with
the
scope,
it
has
to
do
with
the
general
waiver.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why
would
they
have
wanted
to
do
that?
that
is
to
say,
look,
if
you
cut
the
exception
to
the
exception
to
the
exception,
the
presumption,
da,
da,
da,
out
of
it,
what
we've
got
on
your
interpretation
is
that
a
person
who's
hurt
by
a
battery
committed
by
a
government
official,
given
your
interpretation,
has
no
remedy
at
all.
i
mean,
previously
he
could
have
at
least
sued
in
state
court.
now
what
you're
saying
is
congress
tried
to
do
with
this
language
is
say,
hey,
you
can't
sue
in
state
court,
and
by
the
way,
when
you
try
to
sue
the
federal
government,
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
your
suit,
either.
why
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
--
are
you
finished
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
you
go
back
for
a
minute
and
think
before
this
act
was
passed,
the
gonzalez
act,
and
think
of
the
millions
of
government
employees,
and
they're
in
different
parts
of
the
country,
and
some
of
them
commit
batteries.
now,
you
told
me
before
that
where
an
injured
person,
a
plaintiff,
sues
a
government
employee
and
they
sue
under
state
tort
law
and
they
say,
this
government
employee
committed
a
battery,
okay,
in
the
course
of
duty,
you
say
there
was
an
immunity
there.
where
did
the
immunity
come
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
from
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
what
was
the
theory
of
it?
i
mean,
here
it's
just
--
it's
a
person,
he's
at
work,
he
does
happen
to
work
for
the
federal
government
instead
of
working
for
someone
else--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
everybody
else,
you
have
to
respond,
and
if
liable,
you'd
have
to
pay
damages
for
the
battery.
where
did
the
immunity
come
from--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
the
employee
did
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
