mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
brought
this
in
rem
action
against
mr.
lozman's
uninsured
houseboat
to
enforce
maritime
liens.
the
houseboat
was
in
violation
of
the
wet
slip
agreement,
and
it
posed
a
hazard
to
other
vessels
in
the
marina
if,
because
of
its
flimsy
moorings,
it
came
unmoored
during
a
storm.
the
houseboat
was
located
very
close
to
the
navigable
channel
of
the
atlantic
intercoastal
waterway
and
next
to
a
yacht-building
facility
next
to
the
marina.
so
the
city
faced
a
very
real
specter
of
being
sued
if
the
uninsured
houseboat
came
unmoored
and
caused
damage.
our
position
is
that
the
houseboat
is
a
vessel
under
section
3
because
it
floats,
moves,
and
carries
people
or
things
on
water,
as
the
statutory--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
an
inner
tube
actually
does
not--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
a
person
actually
--
most
of
the
body
parts
of
a
person
would
be
underwater
and
would
be
through
the
water,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
test
would
be
what's
the
practical
capability,
and
a
raft
that
has
a
bottom
actually
could
very
well
be
a
vessel
under
the
appropriate
standard
of
practical
capability.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
cup
is
not
because
a
cup
doesn't
float.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
kagan,
i
--
i
think
we
could
imagine
all
kinds
of
de
minimis
types
of
hypotheticals
that
would
satisfy
the
basic
criteria.
but
what
the
court
in
stewart
said
was
practical
capability
as
viewed
in
a
real
world
sense.
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
--
and
they've
certainly
not
pointed
to
anything
--
that
identifies
anything
with
those
kind
of
practical
attributes
that
would
be
subject
to
litigation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
you're
--
yes.
you're
--
that
is
true
in
the
sense
that
one
of
the
purposes
as
manifested
through
its
physical
characteristics
is
the
ability
to
be
moved
across
water.
and
just
as
mr.
lozman's
houseboat
here
was
moved
200
miles
in
the
first
towage
after
the
hurricane
wiped
out
every
other
vessel
in
the
docks
in
the
north
bay
marina,
and
he
had
it
towed
with
a
speed
boat
70
miles
to
the
city
of
riviera
beach,
those
physical
characteristics
and
attributes
were
recognized
by
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
applied
the
practical
capability
test.
and
it
said
on
page
15(a)
of
the
petition
appendix
that
certainly
living,
a
domicile,
is
a
purpose
of
a
floating
home,
but
mobility
is
also
a
purpose,
and
then
demonstrated
that
mobility
here.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
evansville
is
a
case
with
many
layers,
but
let
me
just
start
first
start
with
the
fact
that
the
court
announced
a
practical
capability
test
in
evansville
itself.
that's
what
it
applied.
it
reviewed
a
district
court
record
that
had
found
no
practical
capability
on
the
basis
of
the
driveways
and
the
more
permanent
connections
to
the
utility
system
of
the
city,
and
it
reviewed
that
factual
record
for
clear
error,
which,
of
course,
it
didn't
find,
by--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
in
stewart
you
said
what
the
holding
of
the
case
was,
which
was
that
it
was
not
practically
capable
of
movement
at
the
time
that
it
sank.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
step
back
for
a
second
because
i
think
evansville
needs
to
be
understood
in
the
time
in
which
it
was
decided.
at
that
time,
many
courts,
including
this
one,
at
times,
applied
a
snapshot
test,
what
is
happening
to
this
particular
watercraft
at
the
moment
in
time
where
an
admiralty
tort
occurs,
where
the
contract
ensues,
and
the
like.
this
court
subsequently
disavowed
the
snapshot
test;
but,
in
stewart,
what
the
court
did
was
to
describe
evansville
and
cope
as
cases
about
not
practically
capable
of
movement
or
carriage
because
of
their
connections
to
the
land.
in
evansville,
the
owner
of
the
wharf
boat
also
owned
the
adjoining
land
and
had
control
over
the
dock
and
built
driveways
so
that
trucks
could
come
on
and
off,
and
had
an
eight-inch
concrete
lining
on
the
houseboat
which
are
not
typically
--
sorry,
on
the
wharf
boat,
which
are
not
typically
attributes
one
would
think
of
as
ordinarily
for
vessels.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
it
certainly
did
have
that.
it
had
that
capability,
justice
breyer,
because
it
was
actually
moved
on
multiple
occasions.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
was
carrying
his
personal
effects.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
transported
his
computers;
it
transported
his
clothes.
except
the
for
the
fact
that
his
guns
were
confiscated
before
the
marshals
took
it--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it
was
moved,
that
--
no,
they
are
not
part
of
the
house.
they
are
part
of
the
personal
effects,
just
as
someone
had
personal
effects
in
his
or
her
dwelling.
and
when
the
marshal
towed
it,
it
carried
two
people
as
part
of
the
crew
for
the
transit
between--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
actually,
i
think
mr.
fisher
conceded
that
if
this
had
a
motor
and
it
was
carrying
exactly
the
same
personal
effects,
it
would
be
a
vessel.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
that
a
vessel
that
has
practical
capability,
a
watercraft
that
has
practical
capability
to
float,
move
and
carry
goods
or
people,
that's
a
vessel.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
i've
given
up
the
absurd
hypos
because
there
are
no
litigation
on
them.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
if
it
has
the
practical
capability.
that's
what
the
statute
says,
justice
kagan.
it
depends
on
if
you
want
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
have
subjective
intent--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--of
lots
of
vessel
owners.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
kagan,
the
fact
that
a
vessel
only
moves
once
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
a
vessel
if
it
has
--
if
it
meets
the
attributes
of
the
statute,
as
explained
by
this
court
in
stewart,
of
practical
capability.
the
titanic,
of
course,
is
a
perfect
example
of
that.
the
fact
that
a
person
may
choose
mobility
as
one
of
the
attributes
and
not
exercise
that
attribute
of
course
goes
to
subjective
intent,
and
as
the
maritime
law
association's
brief
points
out
here,
you
do
not
want
to
apply
an
intent
standard
that
goes
to
what
the
owner
intends
to
--
which
function
the
owner
intends
to
exercise,
because
that
leads
to
manipulation.
and
the
casino--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
but
there
are
some
exceptions
and
if
--
i
will
let
you
finish
your
question.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
i
would
answer
that
question
as
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
it's
a
vessel
and
the
exclusive
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
courts
means
that
it
has
to
be
litigated
in
the
united
states
courts.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
why
in
the
first
one,
if
i
could
just
explain
about
the
state
court,
because
i
think
that
there
is
some
misapprehension
about
what
happened.
his
dog
was
not
complying
with
the
ordinances,
and
he
was
not
complying
with
the
city
ordinances;
that's
why
--
that's
why
the
city
brought
the
in
personam
action
against
him
in
state
court.
there
was
no
admiralty
basis
there.
he
was
still
paying
all
of
his
dockage
services
and
fees.
it
became
an
in
rem
action
when
the
lien
was
not
being
discharged
through
his
payment
on
the
dockage
fees,
and
the
city
had
a
basis
under
the
wet
slip
agreement
to
assert
a
maritime
lien,
which
is
a
classic
admiralty
action
under
federal
jurisdiction.
so
they
are
very
different
actions.
under
the
state
court
action
he
could
still
stay
at
the
marina,
but
he
had
to
be
on
a
houseboat
that
complied
with
the
marina's
rules.
he
had
two
house
boats
at
the
marina,
and
this
one
was
not
in
compliance,
and
that
is
why
the
city
brought
action
against
it.
it
was
the
only
one
of
the
500-plus
vessels
and
boats
in
this
marina
that
wasn't
in
compliance
with
the
rules.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
that
sums
up
in
a
nutshell
what
we
would
regard
as
a
proper
statement
of
the
law,
of
what
this
court
has
already
said,
and
that
is
that
if
it's
got
practical
capability,
those
practical
characteristics,
justice
kennedy,
will
manifest
itself
in
the
functions.
if
somebody
wants
to
buy
a
domicile
on
land,
one
buys
a
house
or
a
condo.
if
you
buy
a
floating
home,
that
has
the
attribute,
the
physical
characteristics
of
floating,
movage
--
and
moving
and
carriage--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
breyer,
there
is
no
basis,
i
mean,
with
all
due
respect,
there
is
no
basis
in
your
cases
to
hold
that
there
is
something
about
transportation
that
makes
it
somehow
uniquely
nautical
or
maritime
as
opposed
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--household
effects
or
other
goods
or
services
or
people
that
are
transported
over
land.
and
that's
why
when
the
normal
definition
of
transportation
is
to
convey
a
person
or
a
thing
from
one
place
to
another,
that's
perfectly
satisfied
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
it
is
an
undisputed
record
as
petitioner
says,
on
page
27
of
the
cert
petition,
they
ask
for
cert
here
for
you
to
decide
whether
mr.
lozman's
state
of
mind
about
his
indefinite
mooring
is
somehow
relevant
to
the
definition
of
a
vessel.
it
clearly
isn't.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
don't
accept
the
premise
of
your
argument.
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
dry
docks
with
which
i
am
familiar
are
anchored
to
the
bottom
so
that
they
can
stay
in
one
place
and
they
don't
carry
anything,
so
they
don't
meet
the
part
of
the
test
that
requires
carriage.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
are
simply
physical
structures--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
don't
think
it's
practically
capable
of
carrying
anything.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
again--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
it
would
not
be
subject
to
towage.
here
the
houseboat
had
--
this
is
important
because
the
houseboat
under
the
testimony
mr.
lozman
elicited
at
trial
had
four
towing
cleats
that
were
welded
into
the
structure
of
his
houseboat
so
that
it
could
be
towed
without
torquing
and
twisting
the
houseboat
and
causing
it
to
sink.
the
hypotheticals
that
the
other
side
has
suggested
don't
have
that
additive
feature
of
towing
cleats
that
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
being
able
to
convey
the
houseboat--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
the
physical
characteristics
of
this
houseboat
all
point
to
the
attributes
of
being
a
vessel.
it
floats,
it
moves,
it
carries.
it's
got
nothing
to
do--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
mr.
chief--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
would
submit
that
congress
did
not
intend
a
you-know-it-when-you-see-it
test.
house
barges,
barges
have
been
vessels
since
the
time
of
cleopatra.
the
fact
that
it
is
flat-bottomed
and
it
floats
and
it
moves
and
it
carries
things
does
not
make
it
not
a
vessel.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
unless
it
has
a
physical
impediment
that
takes
it
out
of
one
of
the
three
attributes
that
doesn't
make
it
a
vessel.
if--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
not
familiar--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--we
suggest
that
the
way
the
court
should
think
about
that
problem
is
as
a
physical
impediment.
are
physical
impediments
preclude
its
moat
movement
or
its
carriage
or
its
floating
capacity--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
that's
a
fair
way
to
view
it,
justice
kagan,
and
it's
a
perfectly
appropriate
one.
the
belle
of
orleans
case--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think
that
as
a
practical
matter,
this
arises
in
only
a
couple
of
instances
and
those
are
the
casino
boats,
many
of
which
were
vessels
and
they
traversed
the
rivers
allowing
people
to
gamble
because
that's
how
state
laws
required
them
to
perform.
and
they
have
since
stopped
trying
to
be
vessels
because
of
state
law
changes
that
they
were
able
to
make.
and
so
the
question
as
a
practical
matter
is
are
there
physical
impediments
to
the
ability
of
that
boat
to
use
the
capability
to
move?
the
star
of
india,
which
was
referenced
in
the
belle
of
orleans
case,
was
not
--
was
a
vessel,
a
sailing
vessel
from
the
19th
century.
in
1926
they
took
it
out
of
commission
as
a
sailing
vessel
and
they
towed
it
to
san
diego,
where
it
sat
for
50
years
tied
to
the
dock,
and
for
the
bicentennial,
they
decided
let's
get
the
boat
out
and
sail
it
and
they
sailed
it
for
the
bicentennial.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that's
a
vessel
because
it
has
the
capability
of
being
used
as
a
vessel.
and
the
fact
that
something
is
moored
for
a
long
time,
if
it
has
the
physical
attributes
to
be
a
vessel,
it
is
a
vessel.
the
united
states
--
the
uss
constitution,
the
famous
uss
constitution
would
be
shocked
to
have
heard
mr.
gannon's
statement
about
vessel
because
there
are
200
navy
service
members
who
service
the
uss
constitution
and
take
it
out
periodically
for
sail.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--if
it
were
a
problem
the
coast
guard
would
have
signed
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
this
case
which
they
have
done
in
other
cases
in
which
transportation
and
vessel
status
have
been
relevant
like
in
sprietsma
v.
mercury
marine,
united
states
v.
locke,
in
which
the
coast
guard--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
the
statute
underlying
those
regulations,
justice
sotomayor,
is
found
at
46
usc
4302,
and
it
provides
the
secretary
very
broad
discretion
on
what
to
include
within
the
regulations
and
what
not
to.
after
this
court
decided
the
stewart
case,
the
secretary
suspended
many
regulations
for
dockside
vessels
until
the
coast
guard
could
issue
new
regulations.
there
is
a
hint,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
there
might
be
a
problem,
but
there
is
not
anything
that
is
really
given
in
practical
terms.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
and
the
reason
why
is
because
as
this
court
recognized
in
stewart,
the
in
navigation
requirement
is
something
that
has
been
used
for
limiting
the
reach
of
jones
act
seamen
in
those
circumstances
in
which
a
vessel
is
taken
out
of
navigation.
so
i
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
in
a
case
like
this
where
this
is
a
classic
instance
of
a
maritime
lien,
dockage--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
but
--
and
in
fact,
i
think
the
question
of
who
is
a
jones
act
seaman
is
a
different
test
that
this
court
last
discussed
in
the
chandris
case
in
terms
of
its
substantial
connection
to
the
mission
of
the
vessel.
and
that
--
i
think
that
the
court
could
safely
leave
the
jones
act
issues
aside,
because
they
bring
in
an
entirely
different
regime
that
focuses
on
the
worker's
connection
to
the
vessel
as
opposed
to
the
definition
of
vessel
itself.
the
definition
of
vessel
itself
here
is,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
part
of
the
dictionary
act,
and
it
is
something
that
does
apply
more
broadly.
but
as
we
briefed
in
this
case,
there
are
two
provisions
that
take
that
definition
and
then
they
add
an
intent
requirement
as
specific
language
in
different
parts.
so
that
if
that
idea,
function,
or
intent
or
purpose
is
something
that
is
germane
to
that
particular
statutory
function,
than
that
is
a
question
that
becomes
a
question
for
jurisdiction.
but
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
both,
i
think,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
assumed
that
there
was
jurisdiction
here
because
there
had
not
been
evidence
that
contested
the
basic
principles
that
the
city
brought
when
it
filed
this
in
rem
action.
and
because
the
case
then
moved
into
the
merits
phase,
the
district
judge
here
initially
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction
without
prejudice.
and
then
as
the
evidence
came
in,
revisited
the
question
to
provide
a
fuller
explanation,
and
at
that
time
made
the
ruling
that
mr.
lozman
had
not
put
in
record
evidence
that
affected
the
practical
capability
of
the
test.
the
only
thing
mr.
lozman
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
reason
for
error
was
that
because
he
intended
to
live
there
indefinitely,
even
though
he
had
no
contractual
or
property
right
to
do
so,
and
he
had
signed
a
wet
slip
agreement
that
provided
the
marina
complete
discretion
to
move
his
houseboat
within
any
of
the
slips,
or
to
order
of
the
houseboat
to
leave
on
3
days'
notice,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
record
of
evidence
on
practical
capability
got
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
and
the
eleventh
circuit,
in
applying
a
practical
capability
test,
said
the
things
that
mr.
lozman
had
argued,
he
didn't
offer
record
evidence.
so,
justice
kennedy,
to
your
point,
i
think
that
with
respect
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
how
it
did
do
its
job
is
an
important
facet
of
the
case
as
it
comes
here.
they
initially
asked
you
in
the
cert
petition
to
grant
cert
because
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
implied
an
onerous
intent
test.
they've
not
defended
that
test.
and
it
is
abjectly
erroneous
because
you
can't
have
vessel
status
be
so
easily
manipulated
by
an
individual's
intent.
and
now
by
trying
to
morph
it
into
some
kind
of
function
or
objective
purpose
standard,
they've
essentially
done
exactly
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said
they
had
offered
no
evidence
in
the
district
court
to
try
to
prove.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
