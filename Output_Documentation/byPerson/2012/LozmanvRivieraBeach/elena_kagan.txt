justice
elena
kagan
well,
then
you're
not
talking
about
purpose;
you're
talking
about
function,
right?
you're
just
using
purpose
as
a
kind
of
strange
synonym
for
function.
but
you're
not
talking
about
purpose
of
either
the
homeowner
or
the
manufacturer
of
the
boat.
you're
just
saying
what
does
this
--
or
what
does
this
thing,
this
floating
home,
do.
justice
elena
kagan
right.
so
you
are
really
talking
about
a
function
test.
and
you
are
using
strange
words,
because
they
come
out
of
our
opinions
--
kind
of
not
your
fault.
but
you're
really
saying
that
what
should
apply
here
is
a
function
test.
we
are
looking
at
this
floating
home.
what
does
it
do?
is
it
just
a
thing
that
sits,
or
is
it
a
thing
that
transports
things
over
water.
isn't
that
your
test?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
do
we
know
that.
justice
elena
kagan
how
do
we
know
that,
mr.
fisher?
i
mean,
maybe
these
floating
homes
are
just
a
poor
man's
houseboat,
right?
but
the
point
of
getting
a
floating
home
is
actually
to
have
a
home
that
you
can
hook
up
to
a
boat
and
move
from
place
to
place,
and
so
you
don't
have
to,
you
know,
have
the
motor
running
all
the
time
or
have
the
capacity
to
move
it
all
the
time,
but
when
you
want
to
move
it
on
water
and
when
you
want
to
move
your
possessions
on
water,
you
have
the
capacity
to
do
so.
justice
elena
kagan
so,
mr.
gannon,
you
think
that
even
at
the
moment
that
the
thing
is
being
transported,
and
let's
say
that
the
thing
has,
you
know,
various
furniture
and
things
on
it,
you
think
even
at
that
moment
under
section
3,
it's
not
a
--
it
might
not
be
a
vessel?
justice
elena
kagan
take
the
inner
tube
and,
you
know,
paste
a
couple
of
pennies
on
the
inner
tube.
now
it
carries
things.
there
are
things
on
the
inner
tube,
and
it
floats.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
suppose,
mr.
frederick,
this.
suppose
we
had
a
trial
on
the
question
of
whether
these
floating
homes
or
this
floating
home
was
a
vessel,
and
we
found
out
that
actually
99
percent
of
people
who
buy
floating
homes
move
it
exactly
once.
they
purchase
the
floating
home
and
then
they
move
it
to
the
place
where
they
want
the
home
to
be,
and
then
it
sits
there.
and
this
was
just
a
clear
evidence
that,
you
know,
except
if
there's
a
hurricane
or
a
tornado,
people
do
not
move
floating
homes.
they
buy
it,
they
move
it
to
where
they
want
to
live,
and
then
it
sits.
in
that
case,
do
you
think
the
thing
is
a
vessel?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
a
statute--
justice
elena
kagan
--you
are
reading
the
statute
--
you
are
reading
the
statute
as
if
it
says
something
can
be
transported
over
water.
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
something
can
be
used
or
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation
on
water.
so
that
--
that
the
question
is
whether
this
thing
is
transporting
other
things
over
water,
and
whether
that's
its
function;
and
in
my
hypothetical
it's
not
its
function.
its
function
is
to
serve
as
a
house.
that
house
happens
to
be
on
water
but
it's
just
a
house.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
frederick,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
your
test
really
comes
down
to
how
securely
is
something
fastened.
i
mean,
you
have
to
deal
with
evansville's
wharf
boat
and
cage's
dry
dock,
and
you
have
to
deal
with
all
these
floating
casinos
and
restaurants.
and
you're
saying
that
in
all
these
cases
we
are
supposed
to
look
to
is
it
a
rope
or
is
it
a
cable,
how
many
cables,
how
quickly
can
it
be
disengaged,
and
that
that's
going
to
end
up
being
the
test
that
you
would
have
us
adopt
which
is
how
easy
it
is
to
get
out
of
the
port.
justice
elena
kagan
that
really
does
become
a
jury
question
--
a
question
of
fact
for
everything,
right?
you
know,
are
there
six
cables,
are
there
nine
cables,
what
are
they
made
of,
you
know,
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
to
rip
up
the
i-beams,
whatever?
