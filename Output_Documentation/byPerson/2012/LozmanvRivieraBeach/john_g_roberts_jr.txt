chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-626,
lozman
v.
the
city
of
riviera
beach.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
just
has
--
i
understand
that
argument.
it's
got
no
connection
whatever
to
the
statutory
language,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
capable
is
in
the
statute,
purpose
is
not,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
get
to
evansville,
let's
say
it
moved
around,
which
is
one
thing,
but
also
it
had
a
raked
bow;
it
wasn't
square.
then
--
then
it
starts
to
look
more
like
a
boat.
it
moves
around
more
frequently.
its
mooring
--
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
sailboat
and
you
pull
it
up
to
a
dock,
you
hook
up
for
water
and
plug
in
for
power.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
terribly
significant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
aren't
you
just
begging
the
question?
you
keep
saying
it
was
not
a
vessel
to
begin
with.
why
--
doesn't
it
just
restate
the
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
doesn't
your
argument
beg
the
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
changes
--
one
--
the
same
thing
is
not
a
boat
sometimes,
and
it
is
a
boat.
you've
got
a
casino
that's
tied
up
for
a
month.
during
that
time,
it's
not
a
boat.
and
then
they
move
it
around
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
river,
and
during
that
time
it
is
a
boat?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
--
but
i'm
just
--
the
hypothetical
--
the
hypothetical
i
posed
was
meant
to
pose
the
question,
well,
sometimes
things
do
both,
and
how
do
we
tell
which
it
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gannon.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
--
can
i
interrupt
you
just
there
on
the
dredging?
you
say
the
function
of
the
dredge
was
to
carry
people
and
equipment.
i
would
have
said
the
function
of
the
--
the
dredge
is
to
dredge
in
the
middle
of
the
river.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right?
and
so
--
and
i
don't
know
which
of
us
would
be
right,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that
function
test
is
a
very
difficult
one
to
apply.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know
what
it
said.
i
guess
i
would
say,
obviously,
it
serves
a
waterborne
function,
but
i'm
not
sure
the
first
thing
i
would
say
when
i
see
one
of
these
dredges
in
the
middle
of
the
river
is
its
purpose
is
to
move
people
and
equipment.
i
would
say
its
purpose
is
to
dredge.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
that's
saying
that
it
has
to
be
able
to
move,
and
i
agree
with
that.
but
its
purpose
is
still
to
dredge,
not
to
move.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
could
use
it
if
you
had
a
--
you
know,
a
transportation
boat,
right?
any
equipment
you
need
to
move,
you
put
it
on
another
boat
and
drop
it
off.
the
people
who
work,
you
bring
them
over
and
drop
it
off.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure
it
is,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
superscoop
doesn't
go
to
the
--
maybe
it
does
--
go
to
the
shore
every
morning,
then
come
right
out
again?
they
move
people
back
and
forth
with
other
boats,
don't
they?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
like
an
inner
tube,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
floats,
can
be
towed,
can
carry
a
person.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
of
those
inflatable
rafts
where
most
of
the
parts
of
the
people--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
practical
capability
viewed
in
a
real-world
sense
--
and
you're
about
transportation
--
you're
talking
about
things
that
were
built
for
transportation,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
your
example
of
the
towing
cleats
highlights
one
of
the
difficulties
i
have;
one,
because
obviously
the
question
of,
well,
what
if
they
didn't
have
the
towing
cleats,
and
then
what
if
they
had
the
towing
cleats
and
then
took
them
off,
what
if
they
were
temporary
towing
cleats.
one
of
the
things,
this
is
a
jurisdiction
statute
and
we
like
jurisdictional
statutes
to
be
clear
and
easy
of
application.
why
do
you
think
your
test
is
easier
than
your
friend's
test?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
have
--
the
thing
that
makes
something
look
most
like
a
boat
in
my
view
is
a
raked
bow.
that
tells
you
that
that's
what
they
want
to
use
it
for,
to
move
through
the
water.
this
is
straight
up
and
down.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
have
a
--
what
are
the
things
called
on
the
side,
the
elevated
sides
that
you
would
look
for
in
a
boat.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but,
i
mean,
there
is
some
easy
things
to
visualize
as
a
problem.
if
this
is
a
vessel,
then
the
maid
that
comes
on
twice
a
week
is
a
seaman
under
the
jones
act,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
taken
out
of
navigation,
but
not
every
time
it's
docked,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
--
what
was
used
in
the
higgins
boats
in
world
war
ii.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-626,
lozman
versus
the
city
of
riviera
beach
in
florida.
