mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
be
a
vessel,
a
structure
must
be
practically
capable
of
maritime
transportation,
and
this
case
turns
on
how
to
assess
such
practical
capability.
and
that's
a
question
this
court
answered
over
a
century
ago
in
cope
and
perry,
explaining
that
practical
capability
depends
not
on
any
physical
attribute
the
structure
might
have,
but
rather,
on
“
its
purpose
”,
that
is,
whether
its
function
is
to
move
people
or
things
across
water.
and
that
test
has
been
applied
numerous
times
before
and
since,
across
decades,
providing
stability
and
overall
coherence
to
general
maritime
law.
and
of
course--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--practically
capable.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
that's
not
what
this
court
--
case
is
saying--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
in
evansville
in
1926,
this
court
used
that
exact
phrase,
practical
capability.
and
it
assessed
that
practical
capability
by
looking
at
“
the
function
of
the
structure
”.
again
and
again,
in
evansville
and
other
cases,
this
court
asked,
was
the
function
of
the
structure
to
carry
people
or
things
across
water.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
the
word
capable
obviously
is
in
the
statute.
and
what
this
court
said
as
recently
as
stewart
is
that
capable--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--correct.
and
what
this
court
said
in
stewart
is
that
capable
means
practically
capable,
not
theoretically
capable.
there's
a
range
of
how
broad
the
word
capable
can
be.
and
again,
going
back
over
a
century,
every
single
time
this
court's
been
confronted
with
that
question,
it's
used
the
term
function
to
describe
whether
or
not
something
is
practically
capable
of
carrying
people
or
things
over
water.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there's
a
confusion
of
terminology
that
i
hope
i
can
--
that
i
hope
i
can
straighten
out
at
the
outset.
the
term
floating
home
is
generally
described
to
mean
a
residence
that
is
designed
to
sit
still
and
is
not
designed
to
carry
people
or
things
over
water.
the
term
houseboat
is
something
that
is
self-propelled,
generally
moves
people
or
things
over
water.
what
happened
in
the
sea
village
marina
case,
to
my
understanding,
is
the
court
simply
used
the
wrong
term.
it
cited
a
lot
of
cases
that
held
that
houseboats,
as
we
describe
a
houseboat
as
something
that
is
designed
to
move
its
owner
and
the
owner's
things
from
here
to
there,
are
vessels.
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
something
called
floating
homes,
which
the
brief
filed
by
the
seattle
and
sausalito
floating
homes
associations
give
a
very
thorough
description
of
what
a
floating
home
is
and
how
it's
different.
and
a
primary
way
that
it's
different
is
that,
as
opposed
to
a
houseboat,
which
is
doing
its
function,
it's
doing
its
job
when
it's
moving
things
from
place
to
place,
a
floating
home
can't
function
when
it's
out
in
the
water
being
towed.
none
of
the
utilities
work,
none
of
the
power,
no
equipment
is
aboard
to
do
anything--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--justice
kennedy,
it
would
be
indefinitely
moored.
that's
the
term
this
court
used
in
stewart
to
describe
whether
something
was
being
used
to
transport
people
or
goods.
it
had
said
--
i
have
to
emphasize
that
some
of
the
assumptions
we
do
in
fact
dispute
in
your
hypothetical.
but
the
fact
that
it
sat
still
for
three
years
performing
its
function
as
a
stationary
residence
shows
that
it
was
indefinitely
moored.
the
importance
of
indefinite
mooring,
though,
i
want
to
emphasize,
is
actually
less
important
in
this
case
than
it
might
be
if
this
were
a
dead
ship
case,
where
you
had
something
that
was
concededly
a
vessel--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--then
the
question--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
would
still
not
be
a
vessel.
and
you
don't
have
to
look
any
further
than
this
court's
evansville
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i'm
not
sure
if
you'd
use
the
term
indefinitely
moored
at
that
point,
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
transformed
into
a
vessel
because
look
at
this
court's
evansville
case.
the
structure--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
that's
right
if
you
start
with
something
that
is
a
vessel;
the
fact
that
you
simply
leave
it
at
the
dock
for
a
long
time
doesn't
take
away
vessel
status.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
stewart.
but
if
you
start
with
something
that
isn't
a
vessel
--
and
i
give
you
the
roper
case,
which
did
have
a
raked
bow;
it
was
an
old
liberty
ship
that
had
everybody
agreed
had
been
decommissioned
and
turned
into
a
non-vessel.
then,
they
brought
it
in,
they
towed
it
--
justice
ginsburg,
they
towed
it
--
they
loaded
it
up
with
grain.
towed
it
again,
let
it
sit
still
for
a
couple
years,
towed
it
back,
unloaded
the
grain.
and
the
court
said,
it's
not
a
vessel.
and
why
did
this
court
say
it's
not
a
vessel?
and
i
will
quote
from
the
opinion.
it
said:
"because
unlike
a
barge,
the
harry
lane
was
not
moved
in
order
to
transport
commodities
from
one
place
to
another;
it
served
as
a
mobile
warehouse
performing
its
function
of
storing
grain.
"
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
purpose
is
the
overall
question.
the
way
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that
helps
you
determine
its
purpose.
so
the
word
--
where
the
word
indefinite
comes
from,
justice
sotomayor,
is
from
the
stewart
case,
where
this
court
cited
the
fifth
circuit's
pavone
case
with
approval,
which
had
held
that
an
indefinitely
moored
floating
casino
was
not
a
vessel.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
we're
talking
about
an
objective
purpose,
justice
alito--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--exactly.
and
i'm
doing
--
if
i
can
just
say
this
directly,
i'm
trying
to
do
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
cope
and
evansville
and
roper.
the
exact
analysis
this
court
applied
in
those
cases
is
precisely
what
we
want
this
court
to
apply
here.
but
i
think
what
we're--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
the
word
vessel
in
the
maritime
lien
act,
which
is
what
provides
the
federal
forum,
assertedly,
for
the
plaintiff,
the
city,
to
bring
this
case.
so
the
word
vessel
is
its
jurisdictional
and
substantive
hook.
justice
sotomayor,
if
i
can
return
to
your
question
about
indefinite
mooring,
the
importance
of
indefinite
mooring
in
this
case,
where
you
have
something
that
was
not
a
vessel
to
begin
with,
is
simply
to
ask
whether
it's
been
transformed
into
a
vessel,
exactly
as
this
court
asked
in
roper.
so
is
it
being
used
for
its
function
for
which
it
was
created
and--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not
trying
to
beg
the
question;
i'm
just
trying
to
describe
our
argument
to
you.
there
are
some
cases
where--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
hope
not.
i'm
trying
to
distinguish
between
two
lines
of
cases,
one
being
where
you
have
things
that
were
--
like
the
roper
case,
that
were
made
as
boats,
as
vessels
undisputedly,
and
now
the
question
is
whether
they
have
been
pulled
out
of
navigation;
as
opposed
to
another
set
of
cases,
which
we
believe
this
falls
into,
where
the
question
itself
is
whether
this
was
ever
a
vessel.
in
those
kinds
of
cases,
the
indefinite
mooring
shows
that
it's
being
used
for
its
function.
as
a
for-example,
if
i
could
give
a
hypothetical,
maybe
it
would
help,
imagine
a
piece
of
floating
dock.
now,
under
their
test,
that
would
be
a
vessel
because
you
can
unhook
the
dock,
load
it
up
with
stuff
and
tow
it
around,
if
a
company
wanted
to
use
that
as
a
makeshift
barge.
but
no
maritime
case
has
ever
held
that
a
floating
dock
is
a
vessel.
but
if
somebody
did
that,
then
it
would
no
longer
be
indefinitely
moored
and
would
be
used
in
a
different
function
and
might
be
transformed
into
a--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
absolutely
does
because
the
function
of
a
boat
is
to
move
people
or
things
over
water.
so
when
it's
sitting
still,
justice
alito,
it's
not
performing
its
function.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
this
court
in
stewart
rejected
the
snapshot
test
that
i
think
is
what
you
just
described.
the
question
is
whether
what
--
whether
it
has
the
function
of
moving
people
and
things
over
water
or
not.
now,
some
casinos
go
up
and
down
the
river--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
it
actually
does
the
latter
and
is
performing
its
function
while
moving,
then
it
is
a
vessel.
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
stewart.
there's
not
a
primary
purpose
test.
if
one
of
its
purposes
is
to
move
people
or
things
over
water,
then
it's
a
vessel.
but
that's
not
the
purpose
of
a
floating
home.
that's
not
the
purpose
of
a
floating
restaurant
or
something
else
that
might
be--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--you
could
tie
it
up
and
move
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
kagan,
that's
not
why
people
have
floating
homes.
the
amicus
brief
explains
that.
don't
look
at
--
but
you
don't
have
to
look
any
further
than
the
history
of
this.
the
only
two
times
it
moved
any
significant
distance
were:
one,
when
it
changed
ownership;
and
two,
when
a
hurricane
struck,
so
it
had
to
be
moved.
and
look
at
your
own
cases.
in
pavone,
which
this
court
cited
with
approval
in
stewart,
that
structure
moved
hundreds
of
miles
over
several
years.
this
court
said
not
a
vessel.
the
structure
in
evansville
moved
three
different
ways.
it
moved
up
and
down
the
mississippi-ohio
river
as
it
changed
ownership
several
times
over
the
course
of
14
years.
it
also
moved
every
winter
to
avoid
the
ice
that
would
come
in.
and
thirdly
it
was
repositioned
on
literally
almost
a
daily
basis
to
accord
with
the
stages
of
the
river.
and
again,
applying
this
court's
well
settled
function
test,
this
court
said
that's
not
a
vessel.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
the
important--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
would
sound
to
me
just
like
the
floating
warehouse
and
office
in
evansville
as
i
just
described
that
case.
but
justice
kennedy,
let
me
say
one
more
thing
before
i
reserve
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
it's
simply
being
repositioned
and
not
being
used
for
a
transportation
purpose,
that
is
to
move
people
or
things,
then
it's
not
a
vessel.
and
that's
exactly
what
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that
is
not
the
point,
justice
kennedy,
with
all
due
respect.
there's
a
difference
between
a
floating
home
and
a
houseboat,
and
i
urge
you
to
look
at
the
briefs
on
this
point.
and
this
comes
right
back
to
your
question--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--other
floating
commercial--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i'm
not
sure
they
can
actually
disavow
that
on
their
tests,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--floating
commercial
establishments,
floating
pieces,
floating
docks,
floating
trampolines
and
play
structures.
and,
justice
kennedy,
if
i
could
just
answer
your
question
and
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
the
importance
of
the
connecting
of
the
utilities
and
the
water
hose,
which
was
actually
a
specialized
water
hose,
not
a
garden
hose,
but
the
importance
of
those
connections
is
found
in
state
codes
across
the
country
that
distinguish
between
floating
homes
and
houseboats,
asking
whether
they're
dependent
on
those
connections
to
operate.
a
floating
home
cannot
function
if
it's
not
tied
to
land.
it
doesn't
matter
how
many
amps
we
want
to
fight
about,
it's
whether
it
needs
that
power
from
land,
whether
it
needs
those
connections
to
land.
a
houseboat,
like
any
other
vessel,
can
fully
function
away
from
port.
if
i
can
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
i
think
mr.
frederick's
best
argument
that
i've
heard,
and
some
of
this
court
has
echoed
it,
is
that
this
is
a
vessel
because
it
was
moved
around
and
it
carried
his
personal
effects.
the
difficulty
is
that
argument
runs
absolutely
headlong
into
evansville
and
roper;
it
cannot
be
squared
with
those
cases.
and
i
would
be
willing
to
rest
my
entire
case
on
simply
this
court
reading
and
applying
those
cases.
in
evansville,
this
court
dealt
with
something
that
carried
around
the
effects
of
a
business
office.
in
roper,
this
court
dealt
with
something
that
carried
around
grain
and
was
far
more
seaworthy
than
the
structure
in
this
case.
both
instances,
the
court
said
they're
not
vessels
because
the
function
was
not
to
carry
those
things
around,
it
was
merely
--
they
were
merely
incidental
relocations.
now
--
so
for
that
reason,
the
eleventh
circuit
simply
cannot
be
right
when
it
says
that
function
is
irrelevant.
and
the
city
can't
be
right
on
its
test
either.
the
only
way
the
city
has
proposed
to
deal
with
those
cases
is
to
look
at
how
securely
the
structure
is
fashioned.
and
justice
kagan,
you're
exactly
right.
if
you
want
a
recipe
for
disaster
on
jurisdictional
questions,
start
asking
whether
it's
chains
or
ropes.
and
not
only
that,
if
you
want
something
that's
utterly
manipulable,
tell
the
yacht
owner
who
has
his
yacht
down
in
the
harbor
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
hook
it
up
to
the
dock
with
chains
instead
of
ropes
and
now
he's
out
of
maritime
jurisdiction.
so
this
court's
cases
for
almost
a
century
have
applied
the
exact
test
we're
asking
this
court
to
apply.
and
even
if
you're
not
100
percent
persuaded
that
that's
what
the
statute
is
best
read
as
doing,
that
is
what
we
have
done
for
over
100
years,
and
that
is
how
maritime
law
has
built
up
and
guaranteed
on
those
--
on
those
understandings.
and
it's
not
just
the
questions
we
have
been
talking
today
--
it's
employment
law,
tort
law,
all
the
rest
are
built
on
this
test.
and
we're
asking
this
court
simply
to
reaffirm
what
it
has
done
in
the
past.
so
i
think
that
leaves
the
question
of,
when
you
know
the
eleventh
circuit
applied
the
wrong
test
and
you
know
the
city's
test
can't
be
right,
do
you
vacate
or
do
you
simply
reverse?
and
we
think
--
justice
kennedy,
we
think
that
you
can
simply
reverse.
you
have
everything
in
the
record
you
need,
most
notably
in
the
surveyor's
report.
and
you
can
look
at
four
things.
look
at
the
--
look
at
the
materials
used,
the
shape
of
the
structure,
its
equipment
and
the
utilities.
the
materials
used
were
plywood
and
ordinary
land-based
structures.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
any
of
these
are
determinative,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
it's
a
totality
that
tells
you
what
it
is.
and
the
next
thing
is
the
shape.
exactly
as
you
referred.
this
is
a
rectangle
that
sits
10
inches
under
the
water,
is
not
meant
to
be
moved
around.
look
at
the
--
look
at
its
features.
it
has
french
doors
on
three
sides
a
few
feet
above
the
water
line.
that's
not
what
a
vessel
--
not
how
a
vessel
is
designed.
and
finally,
its
utilities.

at
joint
appendix
40,
for
example,
it
says
this
thing
has
no
batteries.
it
is
utterly
dependent
on
being
hooked
up
to
land.
that's
the
only
way
it
can
function.
so
if
this
court
does
nothing
else
between
now
and
casting
its
vote
and
writing
its
opinion,
revisit
this
court's
prior
cases
and
reassert
the
rule
that
this
court
has
always
applied.
