you
--
you
describe
cases
with
this
purpose
--
or
function,
but
the
briefs
cited
the
district
court
decision,
sea
village
marina,
that
says
floating
homes
like
the
one
here
that
can
be
towed
and
are
not
in
the
business
of
carrying
people
or
goods,
but
can
be
towed
miles
across
the
water,
that
those
constitute
vessels.
and
this
district
court
decision,
sea
village
marina,
cited
many,
many
cases.
and
you
say
that
that
district
judge
got
it
wrong,
or
the
cases
were
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you
have
said
sounds
like
this
structure
is
not
a
vessel,
period.
but
your
bottom
line
in
your
brief
is
that,
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
we
shouldn't
say
this
contrivance
is
not
a
vessel,
we
should
send
it
back
--
for
what?
what
finding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
would
we
tell
them
they
should
look
into?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
the
city's
position,
it
is
whatever
we
want
it
to
be.
that
is
the
first
time
lozman
was
sued
by
the
city.
it
was
not
under
admiralty
jurisdiction,
it
was
a
plain
old
landlord/tenant
suit
in
state
court,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
well,
my
question
is,
is
it
--
is
it
a
vessel
when
you
want
it
to
be,
and
just
an
ordinary
landlord/tenant
situation
when
you
want
it
to
be
that
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
this
very
incident,
that
is
he
failed
to
comply
with
the
revised
rules
and
he
was
behind
in
his
payment
of
dockage
fees.
could
the
city
have
brought
that
fee
in
an
ordinary
state
court
for
the
arrears?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
frederick,
this
is
kind
of
an
idiosyncratic
case.
there
are
many
cases
i
think
in
the
courts
now
about
floating
casinos.
i
take
it
under
your
definition
the
floating
casino
would
be
a
vessel
subject
to
maritime
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
long
as
the
vessel
stays
in
one
place
and
the
gambling
goes
on
in
one
place,
then
it
may
be
towed
to
a
different
location,
and
it
stays
there.
you
say
because
it
is
able
to
be
moved
from
one
place
to
another
it
qualifies
as
a
vessel?
