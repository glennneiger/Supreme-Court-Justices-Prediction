justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
--
in
your
brief,
i
really
lost
count,
but
i
think
it's
six
times
on
the
first
two
pages,
you
talk
about
indefinitely
moored.
now,
the
facts
are
in
dispute,
and
we're
not
quite
clear
of
the
facts,
but
let's
assume
that
this
magnificent
structure
is
--
which
was
mercifully
destroyed
--
let's
assume
that
it
was
attached
to
the
dock
by
a
rope,
a
garden
hose
and
an
extension
cord,
and
that
it
could
leave
within
30
minutes
notice.
is
that
indefinitely
moored?
and
if
the
answer
is
yes,
is
that
because
of
subjective
intent
of
the
owner?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
know
the
law
school
game,
suppose
it
was
moved
every
month.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
would
be
indefinitely
moored,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
was
still
--
it
was
still
tied
to
the
land
with
roads
and
ramps
and
so
forth.
here
you've
got
the
hose
and
the
extension
cord
and
the
rope.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
--
and
it
seems
to
me,
suppose
you
--
you
want
us
to
make
some
universal
definition
of
we
know
what
a
floating
home
is.
suppose
this
--
suppose
there
were
another
owner
of
a
structure
like
this,
and
it
moved
to
a
different
slip
every
week
to
get
more
shade
or
more
wind
or
something.
then
that
would
be
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
suppose
it
moved
--
suppose
it
moved
up
and
down
the
canal
to
get
better
or
worse
weather
during
different
seasons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
have
the
same
problem
justice
kagan
says.
the
whole
point
is
that
it
can
move.
that's
the
whole
--
that's
the
reason
you
have
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
the
first
question,
purpose
or
function,
what
did
they
know
that
we
can't
know
by
looking
at
this
picture
and
listening
to
these
arguments?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
would
be
willing
to
stipulate
they
are
better
at
this
than
we
are,
but
let's
--
let's
assume.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
to
be
fair
to
the
court
of
appeals,
well,
now,
you
tell
us
what
the
purpose
and
function
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
we
know
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
--
we
want
i
suppose
to
give
the
courts
of
appeals
a
test
that
works.
i
--
see
if
this
is,
sums
up
your
argument,
or
your
position.
you
look
to
see
the
objective
characteristic,
the
physical
capacity
of
the
--
of
the
structure,
and
then
you
look
not
to
purpose
but
to
its
objective
function:
does
it
carry
goods
under
the
statute.
and
then
i
suppose
you
could
under
that
say
that
this
is
a
vessel,
but
that
this
presumption
is
overcome
if
it's
permanently
moored
in
the
way
the
evansville
dredge
was.
is
--
is
that
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
it's
rather
permanently
moored
with
a,
with
a
--
like
the
intrepid
on
the
hudson
river--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--with
about
--
aircraft
carrier.
but
it's
really
fixed
in
there
with
regular
walkways
and
so
forth.
very
--
it
would
cause
a
lot
of
work
in
order
to
move
it.
