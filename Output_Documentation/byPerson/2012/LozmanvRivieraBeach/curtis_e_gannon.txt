mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
if
i
could
start
with
justice
kagan's
questions,
the
government's
position
is
that
this
is
an
objective
function
test
and
in
evaluating
when
a
structure
is
practically
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
function
is
important
to
that
inquiry.
it
did
so
as
recently
as
stewart,
when
it
recognized
that
the
function
of
the
dredge
there
was
to
carry
crew
and
equipment
across
boston
harbor
in
the
course
of
dredging
a
trench.
it
also
did
so
in
the
cases
that
petitioner's
counsel
has
already
talked
about,
evansville,
roper--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
the
court--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
the
court
in
stewart
said
that
“
dredges
”
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
492
--
"serve
a
waterborne
transportation
function,
because
they
carry
crew
and
equipment
across--
"
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
but
in
general,
it
needs
to
dredge
not
just
in
one
place,
because
it's
not
just
dredging
a
hole,
it's
dredging
a
trench.
it
usually
needs
to
move
in
order
to
do
that.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i
think
that
the
court--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--yeah,
i
think
that
you
could
do
that.
i
think
that's
typically
not
the
way
the
dredges
that
--
not
the
way
the
superscoop
works
in
stewart
and
it's
not
the
way
historic
dredges
worked
in
the
case
of--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--oh,
but
i
--
what
i
meant
is
that
there
are
people
and
equipment
on
the
superscoop
when
it
is
moving
across
boston
harbor.
they
didn't
sort
of
take
it
out
there
all
empty
every
morning
and
then
load
other
things
on
to
it
that
they
--
that
they
brought
out
there.
and
in
evansville,
the
court
recognized
that
the
wharf
boat
there,
which
is
a
large
structure
--
it
was
240
feet
long,
48
feet
wide
--
it
served
as
an
office,
a
warehouse,
and
a
wharf
on
the
side
of
the
river,
and
the
court
said
that
it
performed
no
function
that
might
not
have
been
performed
as
well
by
structures
permanently
attached
to
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
think
that
that
would
be
a
vessel,
because
it
really
--
its
objective
function,
if
you
look
at
its
design
and
its
natural
function
--
that's
the
phrase
that
the
--
even
respondent's
law
professor
amici
used.
they
acknowledged
that
the
function
and
purpose
test
is
appropriate
if
it
takes
account
of
the
craft's
own
design
and
natural
function.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
the
court--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that's
true.
that's
because
it's
no--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it
is
true
that
the
court
recognized
in
stewart
and
the
coast
guard's
craft
routinely
operated
dockside
policy
is
based
upon
the
presumption
that
something
that
used
to
be
a
vessel
can
cease
to
be
a
vessel
if
it
is
semi-permanently
or
indefinitely
moored.
that's
the
phrase
that
the
court
quoted
in
stewart.
and
the
court
recognized
that
even
something
that's
anchored
to
the
seabed
could--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
the
queen
mary
is
behind
a
--
is
essentially
behind
a
cofferdam.
it
doesn't
have
ready
access
to
open
water.
it's
connected
to
shore
in
all
sorts
of
permanent
ways.
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
type
of
case
that
we
have
here,
because
nobody
is
saying
that
this
once
was
a
vessel
and
it
is
now
no
longer
one
just
because
it's
tied
up
to
the
dock
in
the
way
that
it
was
tied
up
here.
and
so,
justice
kennedy,
we
think
that
this
isn't
really
a
case
about
indefinite
mooring
as
making
the
difference.
this
is
a
case
where
you
need
to
start
with
the
question
of
was
it
ever
a
vessel.
and
if
the--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
permanent
mooring
is
usually
going
to
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
something
ceases
to
be
a
vessel,
because
it's
no
longer
practically
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation.
that's
the
way
the
court
discussed
the
point
in
stewart.
and
--
and
that's
true
even
for
a
case
like
roper,
which
was
a
former
liberty
ship
that
was
towed
up
and
down
the
james
river.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
there
were
things
that
had
been
removed
when
it
had
been
decommissioned
originally.
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
test
were
used
here
and
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
something
is
a
vessel
if
it
is
merely
capable
of
being
towed
across
water
even
to
its
detriment,
then
you
can't
explain
the
answer
in
cases
like
evansville
or
in
roper
where
--
because
the
evansville
work
boat
was
towed
at
least
ten
times,
as
described
in
pages
21
and
22
of
the
court's
opinion,
and
nobody
was
asking
whether
it
had
all
the
office
furniture
and
light
fixtures
and
things
like
that
removed
when
it
was
towed
at
least
twice
a
year
for
the
seven
years
before
that
suit
began.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
that's
generally
going
to
be
true,
yes.
if
the
purpose
of
the
structure,
the
function,
the
objective
function
of
the
structure
is
to
operate,
just
to
be
stationary
beside
the
dock,
then
it's
not
going
to
be
a
vessel
even
when
it's
being
towed
behind
another
vessel.
there
may
still
be
rules
about
how
it
needs
to
be
lit
at
night
and
things
like
that,
but--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
--
i
understand
the
point.
i
think
that,
under
a
case
like
evansville,
that
there
does
seem
to
be
a
difference
between
relocating
the
structure
and
using
the
structure
to
transport
people
and
things.
but
under
an
objective
function
test,
if
it
really
is
designed
to
be
mobile,
and
we
look
at
it
and
we
say
it
really
looks
like
a
boat
and
it's
designed
to
move
through
water
efficiently,
it
would
probably
look
different
from
this
particular
craft.
but
if
ultimate
mobility
is
part
of
the
function
of
it,
then
--
then
the
answer
could
well
be
different.
but,
for
the
most
part,
i
think
my
answer
is
the
same
as
i
was
trying
to
give
to
justice
kagan,
which
is
that
this
is
either
going
to
be
a
vessel
all
the
time
until
it
becomes
so
permanently
moored
that
it
should
no
longer
be
deemed
a
vessel.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--there
is
a
question
about
practical
capability
of
being
moved.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
and
before,
you
were
asking
about
the
hook
in
the
statute
here.
we
do
think
that
the
word
contrivance
does
indicate
that
it's
something
that
has
a
function
that's
determinable.
and
there
are
lots
of
other
areas
in
maritime
law
where
the
function
of
a
vessel
is
a
relevant
question,
and
this
is
not
an
unanswerable
inquiry.
the
court
uses
purpose
and
function
when
it's
deciding
whether
somebody
is
a
jones
act
seaman--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--we
think
that
the
record
here
was
not
really
compiled
with
an
object
of
answering
these
questions,
the
things
that
we
think
are
relevant,
because
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
flatly
rejected
any
inquiry
into
the
purpose
or
function
of
the
vessel.
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--that
they
should
look
into
the
purpose
and
function
of
the
vessel.
they
should
also
consider
whether
it
would
be
damaged
when
it
was
towed.
that
was
something
that
petitioner
tried
to
get.
he
was
proceeding
pro
se
in
the
district
court,
offered
to
present
evidence
about--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
they
could
hear
more
about--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
--
i
think
that
somebody
--
if
somebody
--
i
can't
tell
everything
about
the
structure.
we
have
these
pictures,
and
we
know
that
it
has
a
ten-inch
draft,
but
we
don't
really
know
how
--
how
well
it
is
that--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
i
--
if--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
that
you
--
in
--
this
is
going
to
be
a
somewhat
idiosyncratic
case.
i
think
that
this
is
an
unusual
structure.
that's
why
the
surveyor
on
page
j-43
of
the
joint
appendix
found
that
there
were
no
comparables
for
sale
in
the
state
of
florida.
and
so
i
think
that
most
cases
aren't
really
going
to
--
to
be
like
this.
but
if
i
wanted
to
put
on
evidence
about
that,
i
would
probably
compare
--
decide
whether
this
is
more
like
the
floating
homes
that
are
described
in
the
seattle
floating
homes
brief
that
are
really
designed
just
to
function
in
place
near
the
shore.
i
think
that
there
would
be
more
evidence
about
its
capabilities
while
it
was
actually
out
on
the
water
and
things
like
that.
