justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
--
i
thought
there
was
a
--
a
kind
of
caveat
in
one
of
these
cases,
maybe
stewart,
that
said
take
a
thing
that
looks
just
like
a
boat,
the
queen
mary,
but
if
it
is
permanently
--
they
use
the
word
“
indefinite
”.
i
think
they
mean
“
permanently
”.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
it
is
permanently
moored
to
the
shore
and
is
never
going
to
sea
again,
then
it
isn't
a
vessel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
if
the
polynesian
boat
is
permanently
in
the
museum,
there's
a
lot
of
objective
evidence
of
that,
it
would
not
be
a
vessel.
but
if
it's
something
they
really
could
well
take
out
on
the
sea,
then
it
is,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
come
up
here.
that
concerns
the
queen
mary
being
sent
to
long
beach
and
used
as
a
hotel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
with
cup.
what
about
the
cup.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
this
is
lighter
than
you
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
got
stopped
here,
back
at
stewart.
“
practically
capable
of
maritime
transport
”.
now,
those
are
words
i
thought
you
have
to
interpret
with
some
degree
of
common
sense,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
each
of
us
can
of
course
imagine
all
kinds
of
things,
from
styrofoam
sofas
to
--
to
just
dozens
of
absurd
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
ships
or
vessels
and
really
could
be
used
theoretically
to
carry
something
on
the
water.
so
what
we
think
of
is
that
practical
capability
means
that
there
must
--
this
must
really
have
as
a
function,
as
one
of
its
functions
--
i
would
like
to
say
purpose,
but
some
people
apparently
don't
like
that--
[laughter]
--because
it
--
it
has
some
other
implication
that
i
don't
understand.
okay.
so
call
it
the
function
or
the
capacity,
and
it
really
does
as
a
significant
matter
of
carrying
things,
and
not
just
accoutrements
like
nails
in
its
walls,
but
--
but
things
from
place
to
place
to
some
significant
degree,
okay?
so
i
have
just
taken
the
words
of
the
test
and
through
voice
--
and
i'm
trying
to
focus
your
mind,
i've
said
you
have
to
do
that
really
as
a
--
it
has
to
be
some
significant
degree
there,
which
this
one
doesn't
seem
to
have,
all
right?
so
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to
do,
and
really
it's
a
way
of
getting
you
to
respond
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
wasn't
carrying
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
true.
and
of
course
a
styrofoam
sofa
is
--
is
carrying
the
holes,
or
it's
carrying
the
--
you
know,
the
--
the
coffee
can
or
something
that
is
on
top.
but
when
you
have
a
thing
that
carries
itself,
that
isn't
good
enough.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
be
something
to
do
with
transporting
a
thing,
transporting
some
stuff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
part
of
the
house.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
think
of
what
it's
doing
and
compare
that
with
the
dredge
that
every
day
the
workmen
get
on,
they
go
into
the
middle
of
boston
harbor,
and
then
they
start
to
work,
and
they
dredge.
and
so
you'd
say,
well,
i
see
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
boat
is
to
carry
those
people
out
there.
now
think
of
this
one.
this
one
is
carrying
things,
but
that
which
it
carries
is
just
what
is
part
of
a
normal
house
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
transporting
things
on
water.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
how
do
you
then
distinguish
--
i
see
where
you're
--
you're
just
saying
my
distinction
is
not
going
to
work,
and
so
then
i
would
ask
you
to
say
what
one
you
want
to
come
up
with
that
will
get
rid
of
all
the
absurd
examples
that
are
lurking
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
which
i
will
avoid
--
and
yet
include--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
floating
sofa?
somebody
is
retired,
he
likes
to
see
it
float
around
in
the
water,
and
you
know,
and
it
carries
a
cushion.
i
mean,
really
that's
absurd.
so
--
so
how
do
you
distinguish
--
i
gave
you
an
absurd
example.
i
don't
need
to
say
more.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
where
--
that's
exactly
--
i
mean,
i
think
that
works
pretty
well;
and
you
think
that
works
pretty
well,
but
i
don't
agree
with
you
at
the
moment
hypothetically.
so
something's
wrong
somewhere.
and
what
i'm
thinking
is
that
you
had
could
have
very
odd
things,
you
know,
like
an
advertising
sign,
floating
advertising
sign
and
tow
it
around.
is
that
floating
advertising
sign
a
vessel?
no,
it
doesn't
carry
goods
but
it
does
carry,
say,
the
eyes
on
the
figure
which
might
move
around;
and
then
it
does
--
and
justice
kennedy
said
carrying
goods.
all
right.
does
this
structure,
this
houseboat
have
a
function
of
carrying
goods?
you're
tempted
to
say
yes,
because
his
personal
effects
are
in
it.
i'm
attempted
to
say
no,
because
there
is
nothing
special
about
those
personal
effects
that
isn't
exactly
similar
to
their
being
in
a
similar
structure
on
land.
that's
where
i
am
wondering
if
there
is
a
distinction.
that's
--
do
you
see
what
i
--
what
is
bothering
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any
problem
here,
which
i
think
maybe
the
coast
guard
and
the
other
people
who
are
responsible
for
vessels,
say
once
we
start
thinking
that
everything
in
the
house
is
a
vessel
--
i
overstate
--
we
are
going
to
have
an
impossible
time
doing
our
job.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
are
going
to
see
some
kind
of
a
log
next
to
a
beach
somewhere
and
somebody's
going
to
start
calling
it
a
vessel.
we
have
got
to
limit
this
somehow
to
things
that
really
are
used
as
vessels.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
a
problem,
and
if
so,
how
would
you
deal
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fane
lozman
who
is
the
petitioner
here
owned
a
floating
home.
it
consisted
of
a
house-like
plywood
structure
with
french
doors
on
three
sides.
it
contained
a
sitting
room,
bedroom,
closet,
bathroom,
and
kitchen
along
with
a
stairway
leading
to
a
second-level
office
space.
an
empty
build
space
underneath
the
main
floor
kept
it
afloat.
the
home
could
not
propel
itself
across
the
water,
but
it
could
be
towed.
and
it
was
towed
a
few
times
over
several
years
from
one
marina
to
another,
eventually
ending
up
docked
at
a
marina
owned
by
the
respondent,
the
city
or
riviera
beach,
florida.
after
several,
rather
heated
disputes,
the
city
brought
this
lawsuit
against
lozman
in
federal
court
for
dockage
fees
and
trespass.
it
invoked
the
court's
admiralty
jurisdiction
and
the
presence
of
admiralty
jurisdiction,
the
lower
court
say,
“depends
upon
whether
lozman's
floating
home
is
a
vessel,”
as
that
term
is
defined
in
title
i
of
the
united
states
code,
section
iii.
the
lower
court
said
that
it
was
a
vessel.
and
with
the
hope
of
resolving
certain
differences
among
the
lower
courts
about
to
how
to
determine
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
vessel,
we
agreed
to
hear
this
case.
now,
the
statute
defines
“vessel”
as
including,
“every
description
of
watercraft
or
other
artificial
contrivance
used
or
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation
on
water.”
to
go
to
the
bottom
line,
we
conclude
that
lozman's
floating
home
falls
outside
this
definition.
it
is
not
a
vessel.
in
explaining
why
that
is
so,
we
have
attached
two
pictures
to
today's
opinion
comparing
lozman's
home
with
a
wharf
boat
of
a
kind
that
this
court,
many
years
ago,
also
held
was
not
a
vessel.
and
even
though
a
picture
is
worth
a
thousand
words,
we
have
written
a
few
words
of
explanation
as
well.
we
explained
that
the
court
should
not
interpret
the
statutory
phrase
as
if
it
covered
virtually
every
artificial
contrivance
that
floats.
they
must
avoid
reading
the
statute,
and
we
say
some
have
not
avoided
reading
the
statute,
as
if
it
covered,
for
example,
a
wooden
washtub,
a
swimming
platform
on
pontoons,
a
door
taken
off
its
hinges,
or
pinocchio
inside
the
whale.
we
believe
the
courts
must
interpret
the
statute
in
a
practical
way
in
light
of
its
focus
upon
transportation,
which
is
more
than
mere
movement.
we
state
that
often,
as
here,
the
proper
test
will
be
whether
a
reasonable
observer,
looking
to
a
structure's
physical
characteristics
and
activities,
would
consider
it
to
be
designed
to
a
practical
degree
for
carrying
people
or
things
on
water.
and
applying
this
test,
we
hold
that
lozman's
home
falls
outside
the
statute's
language
capable
of
being
used
for
transportation
on
water.
lozman's
home
was
structured
like
a
normal
home,
not
like
a
boat
designed
to
carry
people
or
things
from
place
to
place.
it
was
not
capable
of
self-propulsion.
it
had
been
towed
significant
distances
only
twice
in
seven
years.
it
was
cumbersome
to
move
it
over
the
water.
on
at
least
one
occasion,
a
second
boat
followed
along
to
prevent
lozman's
home
from
swinging
dangerously
from
side
to
side
while
being
towed.
and
then,
there
is
the
picture.
i
need
say
no
more.
we
reverse
the
contrary
determination
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
she
is
joined
by
justice
kennedy.
