justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
just
don't
see
how
you
can
get
purpose
into
this
statutory
language.
it
says
nothing
about
purpose.
it
says,
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation
on
water.
how
does
purpose
get
in
there?
whose
purpose
are
we
talking
about?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
you
may
--
you
may
very
well
have
a
good
argument,
but
if
you're
relying
either
on
purpose
or
on
indefinite
mooring,
then
you've
lost
me.
i
don't
see
how
they
get
--
how
you
get
those
into
the
words
of
the
statute.
suppose
you
have
a
boat,
and
it's
tied
up
at
the
harbor
here
in
washington.
it
hasn't
been
moved
for
five
years.
it's
indefinitely
moved
--
or
10
years
or
20
years.
but
if
it's
capable,
if
you
could
untie
it
and
sail
it
out
into
the
river,
doesn't
it
fall
within
the
definition?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
someone
builds
a
replica
of
an
historic
watercraft,
a
viking
boat,
the
kind
of
outrigger
canoes
that
the
polynesians
used
throughout
the
pacific
ocean,
and
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
display
it
in
a
museum,
no
one
has
any
intention
whatsoever
of
ever
putting
it
in
the
water,
but
it's
built
so
that
if
they
did,
it
would
--
it
would
function
just
like
its
historic
antecedent,
is
that
a
vessel?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
it
was
more
seaworthy
so
that
it
could
be
towed
200
miles
without
suffering
any
damage,
even
if
there
are,
you
know,
small
waves,
let's
say?
and
the
reason
why
it
was
built
that
way
was
so
that
when
the
person
moves
the
person
wouldn't
have
to
hire
a
moving
company
to
come
with
a
van
and
take
out
all
the
person's
personal
belongings
and
ship
those
by
--
by
land.
this
--
this
is
capable
of
moving
and
moving
all
the
stuff
that's
in
it
without
having
anything
damaged.
would
it
be
the
same?
what
would
be
the
result
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
really
just
don't
understand
your
answer.
mobility
surely
was
a
--
was
a
purpose
of
this
because
it
was
moved.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
can
be
moved.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
well,
that's
something
different.
