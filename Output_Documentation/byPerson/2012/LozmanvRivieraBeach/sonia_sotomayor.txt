justice
sonia
sotomayor
counselor,
can
i
--
can
i
--
i
have
been
lost
even
as
i
have
read
the
briefs,
because
there's
a
lot
of
terminology
that
i'm
not
sure
--
and
standards
that
have
been
proposed
that
--
what
concepts
they're
tied
to,
okay?
as
i
see
our
cases,
i
am
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
indefinitely
moored
came
from.
i've
seen
the
word
permanently
moored.
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
a
difference
between
the
two
things,
and
i'm
not
sure
where
you
get
the
latter,
indefinitely
moored,
from,
and
how
that
ties
to
the
concept
of
purpose.
does
it
--
does
the
permanent
status
or
indefinite
mooring
of
a
vessel
not
make
it
--
of
a
structure
not
make
it
a
vessel,
and/or
does
purpose
get
layered
on
top
of
mooring?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
applies
to
whether
something
is
permanently
moored
or
floating
on
the
sea?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
outside
of
your
floating
home,
what
other
structures
would
be
kept
out
of
your
definition
of
purpose
or
function
and
the
city's
definition
of
practically
capable?
can
you
imagine
any
other
function
that's
out
there
floating
around?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
they
disavow
water
skis
and
garage
doors
and
say
they're
practical,
capable
tests
with--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
i
know.
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
was
right.
so
that
permanent
mooring
is
a
different
inquiry
in
your
mind?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
a
--
that's
a
somewhat
easy
case,
because
the
hull,
i
think,
was
removed
or
something
was
removed
that
made
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
how
about
a
garage
door?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
your
definition,
how
do
you
deal
with
evansville?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
you
are
basically
saying,
we
reached
the
wrong
conclusion
because
the
work
boat
floated,
and
it
regularly
was
moved,
and
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
that
it
couldn't
carry
people
or
things.
it
happened
not
to
because
they
would
empty
it,
i
understand,
before
they
moved
it,
but
it
could
have.
so
if
it
was
practically
capable
of
floating,
whether
it
was
semi-tied
to
land
or
not,
it
was
released
from
land
on
somewhat
of
a
regular
basis.
so
are
you
suggesting
that
in
stewart
we
change
the
evansville
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
the
problem
is
the
list
of
absurdities
that
they
point
to,
not
the
least
of
which
is
a
dry
dock,
which
you
talk
about
whether
it's
permanently
moored
or
not,
but
most
dry
docks
are
held
in
place
by,
you
know,
heavy
ropes
but
you
can
cut
them
and
you
can
stick
something
on
them
and
they
can
float
away.
under
--
so
how
do
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--for
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
what
do
you
do
with
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--trampoline
and
the
other
examples
your
adversary
gave?
is
a
trampoline
that
floats
on
water
capable
of
moving
--
it's
moving
the
trampoline.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
carrying
the
trampoline.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
the
difference
whether
i
attach
something
permanently
or
temporarily
to
the
top
of
the
floating
thing,
the
floating
board,
the
floating
whatever?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
not
very
compelling
in
this
case
because
they
have
regulations
that
pretty
much
echo
what
the
solicitor
general
is
saying,
so
it's
not
as
if
they
were
going
to
take
a
different
position.
the
solicitor
general
is
basically
saying
follow
the
coast
guard
regulations.
