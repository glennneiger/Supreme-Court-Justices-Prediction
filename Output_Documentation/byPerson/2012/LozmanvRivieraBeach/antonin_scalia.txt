you
should
have
phrased
the
test
that
way
then,
because
it
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
very
felicitous
description
of
what
--
of
what
the
test
is
--
is
enunciated
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
test
is
whether
it's,
what,
practically
able?
justice
antonin
scalia
practically
capable.
well,
you
could
be
practically
capable
of
doing
something,
even
though
the
purpose
of
--
of
setting
the
thing
up
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
i'm
just
saying
we
ought
to
get
a
different
test,
and
let's
--
let's
get
rid
of
this.
if
we
agree
with
you,
let's
get
rid
of
this
practically
capable
test,
because
practically
capable,
frankly,
would
make
us
come
out
the
other
way
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
about
that
definition?
that
definition
comes
from
the
rules
of
construction
act,
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
provides
the
meaning
of
all
--
of
the
word
vessel
as
used
in
the
united
states
code.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
meaning
of
vessel
in
the
united
states
code
is
at
issue
here?
