justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why
wouldn't
--
imagine
--
there
in
article
ii,
it
says
that
the
president
shall
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.
so
the
president
has
worked
out
--
i,
personally,
and
for
reasons
in
--
in
my
department,
others
think
that
this
law
is
unconstitutional,
but
i
have
this
obligation.
and
because
i
have
this
obligation,
i
will
not,
i
will
continue
to
execute
this
law.
i
will
continue
to
execute
it
though
i
disagree
with
it.
and
i
execute
it
until
i
have
an
authoritative
determination
not
to.
now,
how
is
that
different
from
a
trustee
who
believes
that
he
has
an
obligation
to
a
trust
to
do
something
under
a
certain
provision
that
he
thinks
doesn't
require
that,
but,
you
know,
there's
a
debate
about
it,
but
he
says,
i
have
the
obligation
here.
i'm
going
to
follow
this
through.
there'd
be
standing
in
the
second
case
for
any
fiduciary,
despite
his
personal
beliefs,
to
continue.
we'd
understand
that
and
say
there
was
standing.
why
don't
we
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
part
i
don't
understand.
for
--
if,
in
fact,
as
you
agree,
the
trustee
or
other
fiduciary
in
my
example
would
indeed
have
standing
to
act
according
to
the
law,
even
though
he
thinks
that
that
law
is
unconstitutional
because
of
his
obligation
such
as
under
section
2.
you
agree
he
has
the
--
he
has
--
there
is
standing
when
he
goes
into
court
in
the
first
place,
which
surely
he
could
interpret
article
ii
as
saying
and
you
follow
it
through
as
long
as
you
can
do
it,
which
includes
appeals,
until
the
matter
is
determined
finally
and
authoritatively
by
a
court.
if
you
could
do
the
first,
what
suddenly
stops
you
from
doing
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they're
--
they're
not
in
agreement
about
whether
to
pay
the
money
or
not.
they
are
in
agreement
about
what
arguments
are
correct
legal
arguments,
and
i
can't
think
of
a
case
other
than
the
sham
cases
which
--
which
this
isn't,
where
--
where
you
would
find
no
standing
or
other
obstacle.
and
i
can
think
of
one
case,
which
you
haven't
mentioned,
namely,
chadha,
which
seems
about
identical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
what
--
we
have
always
had
the
distinction
between
the
public
action
and
the
private
action.
a
public
action,
which
does
not
exist
under
the
federal
constitution,
is
to
vindicate
the
interest
in
the
law
being
enforced.
now,
when
the
government,
state
or
federal,
in
fact
has
the
interest,
a
special
interest
in
executing
the
law,
here
given
to
the
president,
and
they
can
delegate
that
interest
to
congress,
if
they
did,
which
arguably
they
didn't
do
here.
but
to
say
that
any
legislator
has
an
interest
on
his
own
without
that
delegation
to
defend
the
law
is
to
import
in
that
context
the
public
action
into
the
federal
government.
now,
that
--
it
hasn't
been
done,
i
don't
think,
ever.
i
can
see
arguments
for
and
against
it,
but
i
can't
think
of
another
instance
where
that's
happened.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
chadha
is
really
different
because
of
course
there
is
an
interest
in
the
legislature
in
defending
a
procedure
of
the
legislature.
now,
that's
--
that
isn't
tough.
but
this
is,
because
the
only
interest
i
can
see
here
is
the
interest
in
the
law
being
enforced.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
--
i'm
afraid
of
opening
that
door.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
but
think
of
another
instance
where
that's
happened,
where
in
all
of
the
12
cases
or
whatever
that
what
this
court
has
said,
without
any
special
delegation
of
the
power
of
the
state
or
federal
government
to
execute
the
law,
without
any
special
delegation,
a
legislator
simply
has
the
power,
which
a
private
citizen
wouldn't
have,
to
bring
a
lawsuit
as
a
party
or
defend
as
a
party
to
vindicate
the
interest
in
the
law
being
enforced,
the
law
he
has
voted
for?
now
i
can
imagine
arguments
on
both
side,
so
i'm
asking
you
only,
is
there
any
case
you
can
point
me
to
which
will
help?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
i
--
as
long
as
you
have
a
minute,
i
--
what
did
you
think
of
mr.
clement's
argument
this
way,
that
--
that
the
execution
--
can
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
execute
the
laws
is
in
article
ii,
but
where
the
president
doesn't
in
a
particular
law,
under
those
circumstances,
a
member
of
the
legislature,
appropriately
authorized,
has
the
constitutional
power
--
a
power
that
is
different
than
the
average
person
being
interested
in
seeing
that
the
law
is
carried
out;
they
can
represent
the
power
to
vindicate
the
interest
in
seeing
that
the
law
is
executed.
and
that's
a
special
interest,
existing
only
when
the
executive
declines
to
do
so.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
would
say
it
would
be
the
same
thing
if
the
state
passed
a
law
--
congress
passes
a
law
which
says,
well,
there's
some
states
--
they
all
used
to
require
18
as
the
age
of
consent.
now,
a
lot
of
them
have
gone
to
17.
so
if
you're
17
when
you
get
married,
then
no
tax
deduction,
no
medical,
no
nothing.
or
some
states
had
a
residence
requirement
of
a
year,
some
have
six
months,
some
have
four
months.
so
congress
passes
a
law
that
says,
well
unless
you're
there
for
a
year,
no
medical
deduction,
no
tax
thing,
no
benefits
of
any
kind,
that
that
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
it
wouldn't
be
arbitrary,
it
wouldn't
be
random,
it
wouldn't
be
capricious.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
just
want
your
bottom
line.
the
bottom
line
here
is
we
can
imagine
--
you
know,
i
can
make
them
up
all
day.
so
can
you
--
differences
between
----
[laughter]
differences
between
states
have
nothing
to
do
with
anything,
you
know,
residence
requirements,
whether
you
have
a
medical
exam,
whether
--
we
can
think
them
up
all
day
--
how
old
you
are.
and
congress
just
passes
a
law
which
takes
about,
let's
say,
30
percent
of
the
people
who
are
married
in
the
united
states
and
says
no
tax
deduction,
no
this,
no
that,
no
medical
--
medical
benefits,
none
much
these
good
things,
none
of
them
for
about
20,
30
percent
of
all
of
the
married
people.
can
they
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
there
isn't
any.
i'm
trying
to
think
of
examples,
though
i
just
can't
imagine
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
you're
saying
uniform
treatment's
good
enough
no
matter
how
odd
it
is,
no
matter
how
irrational.
there
is
nothing
but
uniformity.
we
could
take
--
no
matter.
do
you
see
what
i'm
--
where
i'm
going?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
but
once
--
the
first
part.
every
one
of
those
cases
has
to
be
decided
on
its
own,
okay?
now,
what's
special
or
on
its
own
that
distinguishes
and
thus
makes
rational,
or
whatever
basis
you're
going
to
have
here,
treating
the
gay
marriage
differently?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
started,
you
started
by,
i
think,
agreeing
--
maybe
not
--
that
uniformity
in
and
of
itself
with
nothing
else
is
not
likely
to
prove
sufficient,
at
least
if
it's
rational
basis-plus.
and
--
and
why?
because
we
can
think
of
weird
categories
that
are
uniform.
so
you
say,
look
at
it
on
the
merits.
now
that's
where
you
are
beginning
to
get.
but
so
far,
what
i've
heard
is,
well,
looking
at
it
on
the
merits,
there
is
certainly
a
lot
of
harms.
and
on
the
plus
side
what
there
is,
is,
one,
we
don't
want
courts
deciding
this.
but
of
course,
as
was
just
pointed
out,
in
some
states
it's
not
courts,
it's
the
voters.
then
you
say,
ah,
but
we
want
--
there
are
too
many
courts
deciding
it.
now,
is
--
too
many
courts
might
decide
it.
now
what
else
is
there?
what
else?
i--
want
to
--
i
want
to
be
able
to
have
a
list,
you
know,
of
really
specific
things
that
you
are
saying
justify
this
particular
effort
to
achieve
uniformity.
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i'm
not
missing
any.
and
so
far,
i've
got
those
two
i
mentioned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
means
courts
--
the
courts,
they
do
dictate
in
respect
to
time.
they
dictate
in
respect
to
age.
they
dictate
in
respect
to
all
kinds
of
things.
and
what
i'm
looking
for
is:
what,
in
your
opinion,
is
special
about
this
homosexual
marriage
that
would
justify
this,
other
than
this
kind
of
pure
uniformity,
if
there
is
such
a
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
yet
--
but
here--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
if
there's
no
interest
--
i
mean,
i'm
back
where
we
were
yesterday.
it
seems
to
me,
forgetting
your
--
your
preferable
argument,
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
everywhere.
well,
if
it
is,
then
all
states
have
to
have
something
like
pacts.
and
if
they
have
to
have
something
like
pacts,
then
you
say
then
they
also
have
to
allow
marriage.
so
then
are
you
not
arguing
they
all
have
to
allow
marriage?
and
then
you
say
no.
so
with
that
point--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
--
what
do
you
think
of
his
--
the
argument
that
i
heard
was,
to
put
the
other
side,
at
least
one
part
of
it
as
i
understand
it
said:
look,
the
federal
government
needs
a
uniform
rule.
there
has
been
this
uniform
one
man
--
one
woman
rule
for
several
hundred
years
or
whatever,
and
there's
a
revolution
going
on
in
the
states.
we
either
adopt
the
resolution
--
the
revolution
or
push
it
along
a
little,
or
we
stay
out
of
it.
and
i
think
mr.
clement
was
saying,
well,
we've
decided
to
stay
out
of
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
way
to
stay
out
of
it
is
to
go
with
the
traditional
thing.
i
mean,
that
--
that's
an
argument.
so
your
answer
to
that
argument
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
you
do;
i'd
like
to
know
the
reason.
[laughter]
