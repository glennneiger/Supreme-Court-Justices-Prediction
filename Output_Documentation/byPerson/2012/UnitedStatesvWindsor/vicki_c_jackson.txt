ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
justiciable
case
before
this
court.
petitioner,
the
united
states,
does
not
ask
this
court
to
redress
the
injuries
it
asserts.
the
house
of
representatives'
bipartisan
legal
advisory
group,
the
blag,
which
does
seek
redress
in
the
form
of
reversal,
asserts
no
judicially
cognizable
injury.
while
it
is
natural
to
want
to
reach
the
merits
of
such
a
significant
issue,
as
in
raines
v.--
byrd,
this
natural
urge
must
be
put
aside
because,
however
important
the
constitutional
question,
article
iii
prevents
its
decision
here
and
requires
this
court
to
await
another
case,
another
day,
to
decide
the
question.
in
the
district
court,
ms.
windsor
alleged
classical
article
iii
injury
for
which
she
sought
redress.
other
persons
injured
by
doma's
operation
could
likewise
sue
in
a
first
instance
court
and,
if
their
challenge
succeeds,
obtain
relief.
but
to
exercise
jurisdiction
on
this
appeal
when
the
united
states
asked
for
the
judgment
below,
fully
agrees
with
it,
and--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--your
honor,
it
is
possible
that
in
district
courts
where
other
taxpayers
sue
the
united
states
on
similar
relief,
that
the
district
courts
will
rule
differently.
at
least
one
district
court
that
i'm
aware
of,
in
a
case
called
louie
v.
holder,
ruled
against
--
upheld
doma
even
though
the
government
had
switched
its
position
at
that
time.
in
addition,
the
issue
of
doma--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--your
honor--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--your
honor,
the
--
the
two
questions
that
you
asked
me,
why
did
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction,
the
first
answer
is
that
the
party
invoking
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
was
ms.--
windsor,
who
did
have
an
injury.
as
to
why
the
district
court
didn't
enter
judgment
when
the
united
states
switched
its
position,
i
--
i
imagine
that
the
court
was
--
would
have
wanted
to
have
development
of
that
issue,
which
was
achieved
through
the
intervention
of
the
blag
in
the
trial
court,
so
that
the
judgment
of
unconstitutionality
and
of
refund
would
have
had
a
robust
hearing--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--well,
your
honor,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
affected
by
the
length
of
the
proceedings
it
undertook.
in
kentucky--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--i
am
not
sure
i
have
a
wonderful
answer
to
that
question,
justice
scalia,
but
i
do
think
the
case
bears
some
similarities
to
kentucky
against
indiana,
which
was
discussed
by
the
parties,
where
kentucky
sued
indiana
in
this
court's
original
jurisdiction
on
a
contract.
the
two
states
had
a
contract.
indiana
agreed
it
was
obligated
to
perform,
but
it
wasn't
performing.
there
--
it
was
worried
about
a
state
court
lawsuit.
this
court
exercised
original
jurisdiction
to
give
kentucky
relief.
and
i
think
that's
analogous
to
what
the
district
court
did
there.
the
issue
before
us
today,
i
think,
is
an
issue
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
and
the
u.s.
is
seeking
to
invoke
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
article
iii
courts,
notwithstanding
that
it
doesn't
seek
relief;
it
seeks
affirmance.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
not,
because
i
don't
see
how
that
would
be
any
different
from
any
party
saying,
well,
we
really
don't
want
to
pay
this
judgment
until
we're
sure
all
of
the
courts
agree.
and
i
think
this
court's
--
this
court
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
case
law
where
a
party
seeks
review
to
get
affirmance.
but
in
the
princeton
university
against
schmidt
case,
there
was
a
state
court
conviction,
ohio
state
court
overturns
it,
princeton
university
seeks
review,
because
its
regulations
were
at
issue.
new
jersey
joins
in
seeking
review,
but
does
not
ask
for
relief;
does
not
take
a
position
on
what
relief
would
be
appropriate.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
well,
the
trustee,
i
think,
would
be
able
to
go
to
a
court
of
first
instance
to
get
an
adjudication
of
the
claim.
what
i'm
submitting
to
you
that
the
trustee
could
not
do,
after
getting
the
first
--
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
first
instance
stating
what
the
remedy
--
what
the
liability
is,
then
seek
review
of
that
judgment,
but
ask
only
for
it
to
be
affirmed.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
in
the
first
instance,
the
obligations
are
uncertain
the
trustee
is
presumably
subject
to
potentially
adverse
competing
claims
on
his
or
her
action.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
those
are--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
a
hard
question
under
article
ii.
but
i
think
the
article
iii
questions
that
this
court
is
facing
turn
on
what
the
parties
in
the
case
have
alleged,
what
relief
they're
seeking,
and
what
the
posture
is.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
i
am
saying
primarily--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--i
--
it's
a
little
difficult,
because
the
circumstance
is
unusual,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
think
the
most
apt
of
the
doctrines,
although
they
are
overlapping
and
reinforce
each
other,
the
most
apt
is
standing.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
a
party
on
appeal
has
to
meet
the
same
article
iii
standing
requirements
of
injury
caused
by
the
action
complained
of
and
redressable
by
the
relief
requested
by
the
parties.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
that
the
injuries
alleged
by
the
united
states
should
be
cognizable
by
the
article
iii
courts,
because
those
injuries
are
exactly
what
it
asked
the
courts
below
to
--
to
produce.
but
even
if
we
treat
the
injuries
as
sufficiently
alleged,
article
iii
requires
that
the
party
complaining
of
injury
ask
the
court
to
remedy
that
injury.
and
that's
a
very
important
requirement,
i
think,
under
article
iii
for
several
reasons.
the
idea
of
the
case
or
controversy
limitation,
as
i
understand
it,
is
part
of
a
broader
separation
of
powers
picture,
to
make
sure
the
federal
courts
perform
their
proper
role.
their
proper
role
is
the
redress
of
injury,
and
it
is
the
need
to
redress
injury
in
ordinary
litigation
that
justifies
judicial
review
of
constitutional
issues.
but--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--justice
kagan,
there
is
a
three-prong
test.
even
if
you
treat
that
as
injury,
it
does
not
meet
the
requirements
for
standing
on
appeal,
because
the
government
has
not
asked
this
court
to
remedy
that
injury.
the
government
has
not
asked
this
court
to
overturn
the
rulings
below
so
it
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
$365,000.
it
has
asked
this
court
to
affirm.
and
the
case
or
controversy
requirement
that
we're
talking
about
are
nested
in
an
adversarial
system
where
we
rely
on
the
parties
to
state
their
injuries
and
make
their
claims
for
relief.
if
the
government
or
any
party
is
not
bound
with
respect
to
standing
by
its
articulated
request
for
a
remedy,
what
that
does
is
it
enables
the
court
to
fill
in,
to
reshape.
and
for
a
doctrine
that
is
supposed
to
be
limiting
the
occasions
for
judicial
review
of
constitutionality,
that
is
troubling.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
yes,
your
honor.
but
concession
of
error
cases,
with
respect,
are
quite
different,
because
in
concession
of
error
cases
typically
both
parties
at
the
appellate
level
end
up
being
adverse
to
the
judgment
below
and
they
are
asking
relief
from
this
court
from
the
judgment
below.
but
here
we
have
a
situation
where,
putting
blag
to
one
side
for
the
moment,
between
the
united
states
and
ms.
windsor
there
is
no
adversity,
they're
in
agreement,
and
neither
of
them
is
asking
this
court
to
reverse
or
modify
the
judgment
below.
and
so
i
think
the
confession
of
error
cases
are
quite
different
from
the
perspective
of
article
iii.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
chadha
is
identical,
with
respect.
in
--
for
two
main
reasons.
in
chadha,
the
court
was
i
think
quite
careful
to
avoid
deciding
whether
the
united
states
had
article
iii
standing.
it
intensively
analyzed
a
statute,
since
repealed,
1252,
which
gave
this
court
mandatory
jurisdiction
in
cases
in
which
a
federal
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
and
the
u.s.
was
a
party.
and
it
framed
its
analysis
of
whether
the
statute
permitted
the
appeal.
what
i
think
was
--
oh,
may
i
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal?
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
thank
you.
what
was
--
what
was
going
on
there
was
the
court
said:
well,
the
statute
wanted
to
reach
very
broadly,
perhaps
implicit,
not
stated,
perhaps
more
broadly
than
article
iii.
congress
said
whenever
you
have
this
configuration,
you
go
up
to
the
supreme
court.
then
the
supreme
court
in
chadha
says,
of
course,
in
addition
to
the
statute,
there
must
be
article
iii
case
or
controversy,
the
presence
of
the
congressional
intervenors
here
provides
it.
and
that--
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
thank
you.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
five
points
i'll
try
to
get
to.
just
very
quickly,
justice
breyer,
i
only
answered
part
of
a
question
you
asked
me
earlier,
and
i
just
want
to
say,
the
u.s.
is
asking
this
court
to
tell
it
to
pay
money.
it's
not
asking
for
relief.
justice
sotomayor,
you
asked
me
about
how
the
issue
could
come
up
otherwise.
i
don't
think
i
had
a
chance
to
mention,
private
party
litigation,
employees
against
employers,
there's
an
interpleader
action
right
now
pending
that
was
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
287
employers
--
on
page
32
at
note
54
--
giving
examples
of
how
the
issue
of
doma's
constitutionality
could
arise
in
private
litigation.
in
addition,
state
and
local
government
employees
might
have,
for
example,
fmla
claims
in
which
the
issue
could
arise.
so
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
ways
in
which
the
issue
could
arise.
on
the
question
of
what
the
purpose
of
1252
could
be
if
it
wasn't
to
coincide
with
article
iii
injury
that
was
raised
by
my
--
my
friend
in
his
argument,
i
wonder
whether
the
court
in
chadha
wasn't
saying
something
like
this:
1252
was
congress's
wish
list.
it
was
like
--
like
a
citizen
suit
provision,
to
be
exercised
only
to
the
extent
that
article
iii
power
was
there.
that's
a
way
to
make
sense
out
of
what
the
court
is
doing
in
the
text
and
footnote
there.
as
to
the
question
of
blag,
which
has
been
very
fully
discussed
already,
i
do
want
to
say
that
after-the-fact
authorization
seems
to
me
quite
troubling
and
inconsistent
with
this
court's
approach
in
summers
v.
earth
institute,
and
in
the
--
i
think
it
was
in
the
plurality
in
lujan,
where
you
--
you
--
if
a
party
has
standing,
they
need
to
have
it
in
the
first
court
that
they're
in,
either
when
it
starts
or
certainly
before
judgment.
and
the
rule
as
justice
sotomayor
observed
just
doesn't
seem
to
say
anything
about
authority
to
litigate.
i
think
that
in
addition,
the
--
the
big
problem
here
is
the
injury
being
complained
of
is
inconsistent
with
the
separation
of
powers.
bowsher
and
buckley
make
very
clear
that
once
the
litigation
is
enacted,
congress's
authority
to
supervise
it
is
at
an
end.
it
goes
over
to
the
executive
branch.
and
whether
the
executive
branch
does
it
well
or
badly
in
the
view
of
congress,
it's
in
its
domain.
and
separation
of
powers
will
not
be
meaningful
if
all
it
means
is
the
congress
has
to
stay
out
unless
it
thinks
that
the
president
is
doing
it
badly.
so
i
think
article
ii
helps
give
shape
to
what
kinds
of
injuries
alleged
by
parts
of
congress
can
be
cognizable.
finally,
the
three
--
two
or
three
cases
cited
by
my
colleague
who
last
spoke:
coleman,
karcher
and
arizona,
all
involved
state
level
of
government,
where
the
federal
separation
of
powers
doctrines
articulated
in
cases
like
bowsher
and
buckley
were
not
at
issue.
unless
there
are
other
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
--yes,
sir.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
because
that
resolution
is
not
something
operating
only
internally
within
the
house.
it
is
having
effect
in
the
world
of
the
article
iii
courts,
which
this
court,
in
proceedings
in
it,
is
in
charge
of.
moreover,
in
the
smith
case,
the
--
this
court
said
that
when
the
senate
passed
an
after-the-fact
interpretation
of
what
a
prior
rule
meant,
notwithstanding
the
great
respect
given
to
the
senate's
interpretation,
this
court
could
reach
and
did
reach
an
alternative
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
the
senate
rules,
and
i
would
urge
this
court
to
do
the
same
thing
here.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
your
honor,
i
think
that
when
the
executive
declines
to
do
so,
it
is
exercising
its
take
care
clause
authority.
the
take
care
clause
says
that
the
executive
shall
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed.
i
think
the
laws
include
the
constitution.
so
i
don't
think
the
distinction
offered
by
my
colleague
is
--
is
appropriate.
i
think
it
would
result
in
a
significant
incursion
on
the
separation
of
powers
between
the
legislature
and
the
executive
branch,
and
would
bring
this
--
the
federal
courts
into
more
controversies
that
have
characteristics
of
interbranch
confrontation,
in
which
this
court
has
traditionally
been
very
cautious.
ms.
vicki
c.
jackson
thank
you,
your
honor.
