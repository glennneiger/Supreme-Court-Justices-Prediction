mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
jurisdiction
in
this
case
based
on
the
petition
filed
by
the
united
states
for
the
same
reasons
it
had
jurisdiction
in
parallel
circumstances
in
chadha
and
lovett.
there
are
two
issues
that
have
been
--
that
have
been
brought
up
this
morning
and
i'd
like
to
address
each
in
turn.
one
is
whether
there's
a
concrete
case
or
controversy
--
case
or
controversy
in
the
sense
of
adversity
in
this
court;
and
the
second
is
the
question
of
whether
there's
article
iii
standing
for
the
government
to
bring
this
case
before
the
court.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
where
the
parties
agreed--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
you
didn't
speak
to
it
in
lovett,
your
honor,
but
that
was
the
circumstance
in
lovett.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
that
that
matters,
because
you
had
to
satisfy
article
iii
prerequisites
to
have
the
case
in
this
court.
now,
your
honor
is,
of
course,
correct
that
the
--
the
court
didn't
affirmatively
engage
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
but
that
is
a
scenario--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
i
don't
know
of
one.
but
these
--
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
all
due
respect--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--let
me
say
two
things
about
that
if
i
might,
your
honor.
first
is
that
it's
--
it's
unusual,
but
that's
not
at
all
surprising,
because
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
it's
totally
unprecedented
in
one
respect,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
chadha
--
okay,
the
second
point
i'd
make.
let
me
make
one
point
at
the
outset,
though,
which
is
that
whether
it's
totally
unusual
or
largely
unusual,
i
grant
you
that
it
doesn't
happen.
but
the
reason
it
doesn't
happen
is
because
--
i
wouldn't
confuse
a
numerator
with
a
denominator.
this
set
of
circumstances
just
doesn't
arise
very
often.
now,
it's
true
that
when
this
set
of
circumstances--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--justice
scalia,
one
recognized
situation
in
which
an
act
of
congress
won't
be
defended
in
court
is
when
the
president
makes
a
determination
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional.
that's
what
happened
here.
the
president
made
an
accountable
legal
determination
that
this
act
of
congress
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
that's
an
option
that's
available
to
him,
justice
kennedy.
in
certain
circumstances,
it
makes
sense
not
to
enforce.
but
i
don't
think
the
take-care
responsibility
is
an
all
or
nothing
proposition
such
that
when
the
president
reaches
a
determination
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional,
it
necessarily
follows
that
he
wouldn't
enforce
it.
that's
not
what
happened
in
lovett.
that's
not--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
--
in
the
--
in
the
signing
statement
situation,
your
honor,
one
example
in
the
past
is
turner
broadcasting.
in
turner
broadcasting,
that
was
a
circumstance
in
which
it
was
--
it
was
a
veto,
but
in
the
course
of
the
veto
the
president
made
the
determination
that
a
particular
aspect
of
that
statute
was
unconstitutional.
and
what
happened
as
a
result
of
that
is
that
the
department
of
justice
didn't
defend
that
aspect
of
the
statute
in
litigation.
now,
a
subsequent
president
reached
a
contrary
conclusion.
but
--
but
my
point
is
simply
that
when
the
president
makes
a
determination
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional,
it
can
follow
that
the
department
of
justice
won't
defend
it
in
litigation.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
hesitate
to
give
you
a
black-and-white
algorithm.
there
are
--
there
are
several
considerations
that
would
factor
into
it.
one
of
the
considerations--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
no.
of
course--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--28
u.s.c.
530(d)
presupposes
--
congress
presupposes
that
there
are
going
to
be
occasions
in
which
a
statute
is
--
is
not
defended
because
of
a
conclusion
by
the
attorney
general
that
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
could
be,
but
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
president
made
the
determination.
and
when
the
president
makes
that
determination,
there
are
a
few
considerations
that
i
think
would
factor
into
the
mix
in
determining
whether
enforcement
will
follow.
one
of
them
would
be
the
consequences
of
enforcement
for
the
individuals
who
are
affected.
and
so,
for
example,
i
would
assume
that
if
it's
a
criminal
statute
that
we're
talking
about,
an
enforcement
would
require
criminal
enforcement
against
somebody
and
--
which
would
beget
criminal
sanctions.
that
may
be--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
have
--
justice
scalia--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
have
been
occasions
in
the
past.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
yes,
it's
true.
and
28
u.s.c.
530(d)
exactly
presupposes
that.
that's
the
exact
occasion
in
which
that
process
is
--
is
occasioned.
congress
knew
that
this
would
happen.
now,
it
can
happen
also
when
--
in
the
rare
instance
in
which
the
president
himself
makes
that
determination.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
take-care
clause
responsibility
has
this
all
or
nothing
capacity
to
it.
it
can
be
that
the
president
decides--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
can
be
that
the
president
decides
to
enforce
it.
that's
what
happened
in
lovett
and
that's
the
course
of
events
that
was
sought
--
that
happened
in
chadha.
and
there's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
there
are
--
there
are
a
number
of
considerations
that
could
factor
into
it,
justice
ginsburg.
you're
right
that
either
of
those
scenarios
is
possible.
the
reason
that
the
government
appealed
in
this
case
is
because
the
president
made
the
determination
that
this
statute
would
continue
to
be
enforced,
and
that
was
out
of
respect
for
the
congress
that
enacted
the
law
and
the
president
who
signed
it,
and
out
of
respect
for
the
role
of
the
judiciary
in
saying
what
the
law
is.
the
point
of
taking
an
appeal
here
is
that
the
government
suffered
an
injury
because
a
judgment
was
entered
against
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
a
classic
case
for
injury.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
--
i
won't,
your
honor.
i'll
be
happy
to
turn
--
turn
to
blag
standing.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
on
the
question
of
our
own
standing
to
bring
the
petition
before
the
court.
and
i
think
justice
breyer
was
right.
the
key
precedent
here
is
chadha.
chadha
establishes
a
couple
of
things.
first,
chadha
establishes
that
there
is
aggrievement
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
i
don't
see
what
the
difference
is
between
aggrievement
for
purposes
of
statutory
--
the
statutory
analysis
at
issue
in
chadha,
and
injury
for
purposes
of
article
iii.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
guess
we'd
--
i'd
subscribe
to
the
aggrievement
analysis
that
the
court
made
in
chadha
at
pages
929
to
931
of
its
opinion.
and
what
the
court
said
is
this:
"when
an
agency
of
the
united
states
is
a
party
to
a
case
in
which
an
act
of
congress
that
it
administers
is
held
unconstitutional,
it
is
an
aggrieved
party.
"
"the
agency's
status
as
an
aggrieved
party
is
not
altered
by
the
fact
that
the
executive
may
agree
with
the
holding
that
the
statute
in
question
is
unconstitutional.
"
that
description
is
on
all
fours
with
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--we
represent
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
united
states.
of
course,
in
a
case
like
this,
the
--
the
--
we're
submitting
the
dispute
to
the
judiciary
for
resolution,
so
in
that
sense,
we
--
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
tell
you
that
i
can
dictate
the
--
that
the
judiciary
comes
out
in
one
direction
or
the
other.
i
certainly
would
like
to
be
able
to
do
that,
but
i
don't
think
i
can,
in
all
fairness,
do
that.
but
i--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
--
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
this:
the
united
--
the
united
states
--
the
executive
branch
represents
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
united
states
before
the
court.
it's
not
--
i
think
the
point
of
this
is
that
it's
not
that
the
executive
branch
is
representing
the
executive
branch
alone.
the
executive
branch
is
representing
the
sovereign
interests
of
the
united
states,
and
those
interests
would
include
the
interests
of
the
congress
that
enacted
the
law,
the
interests
of
the
president
that
signed
it,
and
the
interests
of
the
judiciary
in
pronouncing
on
what
the
law
is.
and
the
course
of
action
that
the
president
chose
to
undertake
here
is
in
keeping
with
all
of
those
considerations.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
why
chadha
didn't
engage
on
it
in
particular.
i
think
part
of
it,
justice
kagan,
is
that
the
court
didn't
have
the
methodology
at
that
point
in
time
that
it
does
now.
i--
don't
know
that
it
neatly
divided
between
those
questions
in
the
same
way.
so
yes,
it
left
the
article
iii
question
open,
but
i
think
the
question
of
article
iii
injury
necessarily
follows
from
aggrievement
and
i
haven't
--
i
haven't
heard
a
persuasive
argument
to
the
contrary.
if
we
were
aggrieved
in
the
circumstances
of
chadha,
it
seems
to
me
it
necessarily
follows
that
we're
injured.
we're
injured
in
a
couple
of
ways.
an
act
of
congress
has
been
declared
unconstitutional,
which
chadha
itself
says
constitutes
aggrievement
and
therefore
constitutes
injury.
in
this
case
also,
we're
required
to
pay
a
judgment--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
wasn't
a
--
there
--
that
was
an
issue
in
chadha.
i
don't
know
that
that
issue
was
joined,
actually,
justice
scalia.
the
court
did
say
at
page
939
of
its
opinion
that
congress
is
a
proper
party
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
and
a
proper
petitioner,
and
i
think
that's
the
best
language
for
the
other
side
on
this
issue.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
read
the--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
didn't
--
to
be
--
to
be
fair
or,
as
was
suggested
this
morning,
to
be
cricket,
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
lovett
is
binding
precedent,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i'm
saying
is
lovett
is
a
case
in
which
this
same
scenario
as
happens
here
occurred.
that's
my
--
that's
my
point
about
lovett.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
so
--
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--sure.
so
there
are
two
aspects
of
chadha
that
are
relevant
on
pages
939
and
940.
the
second
discussion
at
page
940,
i
think,
deals
with
prudential
considerations
that
this
court
ought
to
take
into
account
to
make
sure
that
it
has
a
sufficient
adverse
presentation
of
the
competing
arguments
before
it.
and
that's
accounted
for
by
an
amicus
type
role,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
had
in
mind
in
chadha,
because
the
two
cases
that
are
cited
in
support
of
that
proposition
were
both
cases
in
which
there
was
an
appointed
amicus.
so
that
--
that
deals
with
that
aspect
of
chadha.
the
other
aspect
of
chadha
is
the
sentence
that
i
alluded
to
earlier.
and
i
guess
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
that
that
sentence
doesn't
bear
on
the
issue
at
all,
but
i
will
say
this:
what's
cited
in
that
is
28
u.s.c.
1254.
so
i
think
the
point
that
was
directly
--
directly
being
made
is
that
the
house
and
senate
were
parties
for
purposes
of
the
statute
and
they
were
parties
because
they
had
intervened
and
so
they
had
party
status.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
i
guess
my
--
my
point
is
a
little
bit
different.
my
point
is
that
this
was
talking
about
whether
they're
a
party
for
statutory
purposes
under
1254.
i
don't
read
this
to
address
the
question
of
article
iii
standing.
on
the
question
of
article
iii
standing,
i
guess
what
i
would
say
is
this:
chadha
at
most,
if
it
says
anything
about
article
iii
standing
--
and
i
don't
know
that
it
does
with
respect
to
the
house
or
senate
--
at
most
what
it
would
say
was
in
the
unique
circumstances
of
that
case,
where
you
had
a
legislative
veto
that
uniquely
affected
a
congressional
prerogative--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--there
might
be
standing
in
that
situation.
even
that
i
don't
want
to
concede,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
conceding
that
at
most--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
there
are
two
different
cases.
this
case
is
different,
because
this
case
doesn't
involve
the
kind
of
unique
congressional
prerogative
that
was
at
issue
in
chadha.
chadha
involved
a
legislative
veto.
here,
if
i
could
just
finish
this--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--this
thought.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
here,
i
don't
think
the
interest
that's
being
asserted
is
even
in
the
same
plane
as
the
one
that
was
asserted
and
found
deficient
in
raines
v.
byrd.
