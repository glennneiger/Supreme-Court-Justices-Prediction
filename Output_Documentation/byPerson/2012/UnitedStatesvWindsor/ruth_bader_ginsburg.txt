mr.
srinivasan--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
when
the
government
--
when
the
--
when
the
case
is
adjudicated
in
the
first
instance
--
we're
talking
here
about
appellate
authority.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
government
sometimes
loses
cases
in
the
first
instance
and
then
it
doesn't
appeal.
if
it
agrees
with
the
result
that
the
court
reached,
it
doesn't
appeal
and
then
the
judgment
in
the
first
instance
where
there
was
adversity
is
--
is
the
last
word.
so,
when
does
the
government
decide,
yes,
we
agree
with
the
--
the
adjudication
in
the
court
of
first
instance
and
so
we'll
leave
it
there,
and
when
does
it
say,
yeah,
we
agree,
but
we
want
higher
authority
to
participate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
that
include
the
--
does
that
include
the
courts
of
appeals
or
just
this
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
clement,
the
problem
is
if
we
are
totally
for
the
states'
decision
that
there
is
a
marriage
between
two
people,
for
the
federal
government
then
to
come
in
to
say
no
joint
return,
no
marital
deduction,
no
social
security
benefits;
your
spouse
is
very
sick
but
you
can't
get
leave;
people
--
if
that
set
of
attributes,
one
might
well
ask,
what
kind
of
marriage
is
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
divorce?
same
thing?
that
you
can
have
a
federal
notion
of
divorce,
and
that
that
doesn't
relate
to
what
the
state
statute
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they're
not
--
they're
not
a
question
of
additional
benefits.
i
mean,
they
touch
every
aspect
of
life.
your
partner
is
sick.
social
security.
i
mean,
it's
pervasive.
it's
not
as
though,
well,
there's
this
little
federal
sphere
and
it's
only
a
tax
question.
it's
--
it's
--
as
justice
kennedy
said,
1100
statutes,
and
it
affects
every
area
of
life.
and
so
he
was
really
diminishing
what
the
state
has
said
is
marriage.
you're
saying,
no,
state
said
two
kinds
of
marriage;
the
full
marriage,
and
then
this
sort
of
skim
milk
marriage.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
states
have
civil
unions
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
many
had
it
in
1996?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rational
basis,
mr.
clement
--
is
a
problem
in
your
briefing.
you
seem
to
say
and
you
repeat
it
today
that
there
is
three
tiers,
and
if
you
get
into
rational
basis
then
it's
anything
goes.
but
the
history
of
this
court
is,
in
the
very
first
gender
discrimination
case,
reed
v.
reed,
the
court
did
something
it
had
never
done
in
the
history
of
the
country
under
rational
basis.
there
was
no
intermediate
tier
then.
it
was
rational
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
the
court
said
this
is
rank
discrimination
and
it
failed.
