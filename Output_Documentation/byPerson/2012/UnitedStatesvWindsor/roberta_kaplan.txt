ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
focus
on
why
doma
fails
even
under
rationality
review.
because
of
doma,
many
thousands
of
people
who
are
legally
married
under
the
laws
of
nine
sovereign
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
are
being
treated
as
unmarried
by
the
federal
government
solely
because
they
are
gay.
these
couples
are
being
treated
as
unmarried
with
respect
to
programs
that
affect
family
stability,
such
as
the
family
leave
act,
referred
to
by
justice
ginsburg.
these
couples
are
being
treated
as
unmarried
for
purposes
of
federal
conflict
of
interest
rules,
election
laws
and
anti-nepotism
and
judicial
recusal
statutes.
and
my
client
was
treated
as
unmarried
when
her
spouse
passed
away,
so
that
she
had
to
pay
$363,000
in
estate
taxes
on
the
property
that
they
had
accumulated
during
their
44
years
together.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
right.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
obviously,
with
respect
to
marriage,
the
federal
government
has
always
used
the
state
definitions.
and
i
think
what
you're
--
mr.
chief
justice,
what
you're
proposing
is
to
extend
--
the
federal
government
extend
additional
benefits
to
gay
couples
in
states
that
do
not
allow
marriage,
to
equalize
the
system.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
i
think
the
question
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
what
--
is
what
the
distinction
is.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
with
the
federal
government--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--it
has
certainly
been
argued
in
this
case
by
others
that
--
whether
or
not
that's
in
any
way
the
powers
of
the
federal
government.
for
the
reasons
justice
kagan
mentioned,
we
think
the
federalism
principles
go
forward
a
novelty
question.
i
think
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
could
have
its
own
definition
of
marriage
for
all
purposes
would
be
a
very
closely
argued
question.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
i
--
i
think
the
federal
government
could
extend
benefits
to
gay
couples
to
equalize
things
on
a
programmatic
basis
to
make
things
more
equal.
whether
the
federal
government
can
have
its
own
definition
of
marriage,
i
think,
would
be
--
there's
a
--
it'd
be
very
closely
argued
whether
that's
outside
the
enumerated
approach.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
but
that
--
i
don't
know
if
that
would
work,
because
they
wouldn't--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--the
power
to
marry
people
is
a
power
that
rests
with
the
states.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
the
federal
government
doesn't
issue
marriage
licenses.
it
never
has.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
as
long
as
the
people
were
validly
married
under
state
law,
and
met
the
requirements
of
state
law
to
get
married--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--i'm
not
sure
that
the
federal
government
--
this
answers
your
question,
justice
scalia
--
i'm
not
sure
the
federal
government
can
create
a
new
federal
marriage
that
would
be
some
kind
of
marriage
that
states
don't
permit.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
yes.
that
would
not
be
based
on
the
state's--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--well,
that's
what
the
federal
government
has
always
chosen
to
do.
and
that's
the
way
the
federal
law
is
structured,
and
it's
always
been
structured
for
200
years
based
on
the
state
police
power
to
define
who's
married.
the
federal
government
i
presume
could
decide
to
change
that
if
it
wanted,
and
somehow,
it
would
be
very
strange
for
all
1,100
laws,
but
for
certain
programs
--
you
have
different
requirements
other
than
marriage,
and
that
would
be
constitutional
or
unconstitutional
depending
on
the
distinction.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
well,
let
me
--
let
me
answer
that
question
very
clearly.
our
position
is
only
with
respect
to
the
nine
states
--
and
i
think
there
are
two
others
that
recognize
these
marriages.
so
if
my
client
--
if
a
new
york
couple
today
marries
and
moves
to
north
carolina,
one
of
which
has
a
constitutional
amendment,
a
state
constitutional
amendment
--
and
one
of
the
spouses
dies,
they
would
not
--
and
estate
taxes
determine
where
the
person
dies,
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
deduction.
that
is
not
our
claim
here.
moreover,
justice
alito,
in
connection
with
a
whole
host
of
federal
litigation,
there
has
been
federal
litigation
for
hundreds
of
years
with
respect
to
the
residency
of
where
people
live
or
don't
live,
or
whether
they
are
divorced
or
not
divorced
throughout
the
federal
system.
and
the
federal
government
has
always
handled
that
and
has
never
before
--
and
we
believe
this
is
why
it's
unconstitutional
--
separated
out
a
class
of
married
gay
couples
solely
because
they
were
gay.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
that
would
be
certainly
a
different
case.
it'd
be
more
similar
to
the
case
i
think
you
heard
yesterday
than
the
case
that
we
have
today.
we
certainly
believe
that
sexual-orientation
discrimination
should
get
heightened
scrutiny.
if
it
doesn't
get
heightened
scrutiny,
obviously,
it'd
be
rational
basis,
and
the
question
would
be
what
the
state
interests
were
in
not
allowing
couples,
for
example,
in
north
carolina
who
are
gay
to
get
married.
no
one
has
identified
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
we've
heard
it
in
the
argument
from
my
friend,
any
legitimate
difference
between
married
gay
couples
on
the
one
hand
and
straight
married
couples
on
the
other
that
can
possibly
explain
the
sweeping,
undifferentiated
and
categorical
discrimination
of
doma,
section
3
of
doma.
and
no
one
has
identified
any
legitimate
federal
interest
that
is
being
served
by
congress's
decision,
for
the
first
time
in
our
nation's
history
to
undermine
the
determinations
of
the
sovereign
states
with
respect
to
eligibility
for
marriage.
i
would
respectfully
contend
that
this
is
because
there
is
none.
rather,
as
the
title
of
the
statute
makes
clear,
doma
was
enacted
to
defend
against
the
marriages
of
gay
people.
this
discriminatory
purpose
was
rooted
in
moral
disapproval
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
i
don't--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--i
think
it's
an
incorrect
argument,
justice
breyer,
for
the--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--of
course.
congress
did
not
stay
out
of
it.
section
3
of
doma
is
not
staying
out
of
it.
section
3
of
doma
is
stopping
the
recognition
by
the
federal
government
of
couples
who
are
already
married,
solely
based
on
their
sexual
orientation,
and
what
it's
doing
is
undermining,
as
you
can
see
in
the
briefs
of
the
states
of
new
york
and
others,
it's
undermining
the
policy
decisions
made
by
those
states
that
have
permitted
gay
couples
to
marry.
states
that
have
already
resolved
the
cultural,
the
political,
the
moral
--
whatever
other
controversies,
they're
resolved
in
those
states.
and
by
fencing
those
couples
off,
couples
who
are
already
married,
and
treating
them
as
unmarried
for
purposes
of
federal
law,
you're
not
--
you're
not
taking
it
one
step
at
a
time,
you're
not
promoting
caution,
you're
putting
a
stop
button
on
it,
and
you're
having
discrimination
for
the
first
time
in
our
country's
history
against
a
class
of
married
couples.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
it's
a
class
of
married
couples
who
are
gay.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
i
think
that
it's
--
they're
different
cases.
i
think
when
you
have
couples
who
are
gay
who
are
already
married,
you
have
to
distinguish
between
those
classes.
again,
the
federal
government
doesn't
give
marriage
licenses,
states
do,
and
whatever
the
issues
would
be
in
those
states
would
be
what
interest
the
states
have,
as
opposed
to
here,
what
interest
--
and
we
think
there
is
none
--
the
federal
government
has.
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
answer
to
the
question
of
why
congress
singled
out
gay
people's
marriages
for
disrespect
through
doma.
the
answer
can't
be
uniformity
as
we've
discussed.
it
can't
be
cost
savings,
because
you
still
have
to
explain
then
why
the
cost
savings
is
being
wrought
at
the
expense
of
married
couples
who
are
gay;
and
it
can't
be
any
of
the
state
interests
that
weren't
discussed,
but
questions
of
family
law
in
parenting
and
marriage
are
done
by
the
states,
not
by
the
federal
government.
the
only
--
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
is
what
was
in
the
house
report,
which
is
moral
disapproval
of
gay
people,
which
the
congress
thought
was
permissible
in
1996
because
it
relied
on
the
court's
bowers
decision,
which
this
court
has
said
was
wrong,
not
only
at
the
time
it
was
overruled
in
lawrence,
but
was
wrong
when
it
was
decided.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
no,
i
think
--
i
think
what
is
true,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
times
can
blind,
and
that
back
in
1996
people
did
not
have
the
understanding
that
they
have
today,
that
there
is
no
distinction,
there
is
no
constitutionally
permissible
distinction--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--no;
some
clearly
did.
i
think
it
was
based
on
an
understanding
that
gay
--
an
incorrect
understanding
that
gay
couples
were
fundamentally
different
than
straight
couples,
an
understanding
that
i
don't
think
exists
today
and
that's
the
sense
i'm
using
that
times
can
blind.
i
think
there
was
--
we
all
can
understand
that
people
have
moved
on
this,
and
now
understand
that
there
is
no
such
distinction.
so
i'm
not
saying
it
was
animus
or
bigotry,
i
think
it
was
based
on
a
misunderstanding
on
gay
people
and
their--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--today?
9,
your
honor.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
i
think
with
respect
to
the
understanding
of
gay
people
and
their
relationships
there
has
been
a
sea
change,
your
honor.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
i
believe
--
that
was
discussed
in
the
arguments,
8
or
9,
i
believe.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
i
--
yes,
it
was
much,
much
fewer
at
the
time.
i
don't
have
that
number,
justice
ginsburg;
i
apologize.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
i
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
sea
change
has
to
do,
just
as
discussed
was
bowers
and
lawrence,
was
an
understanding
that
there
is
no
difference
--
there
was
fundamental
difference
that
could
justify
this
kind
of
categorical
discrimination
between
gay
couples
and
straight
couples.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
with
respect
to
that
category,
that
categorization
of
the
term
for
purposes
of
heightened
scrutiny,
i
would,
your
honor.
i
don't--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--yes.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
no
other
group
in
recent
history
has
been
subjected
to
popular
referenda
to
take
away
rights
that
have
already
been
given
or
exclude
those
rights,
the
way
gay
people
have.
and
only
two
of
those
referenda
have
ever
lost.
one
was
in
arizona;
it
then
passed
a
couple
years
later.
one
was
in
minnesota
where
they
already
have
a
statute
on
the
books
that
prohibits
marriages
between
gay
people.
so
i
don't
think
--
and
until
1990
gay
people
were
not
allowed
to
enter
this
country.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
political
power
of
gay
people
today
could
possibly
be
seen
within
that
framework,
and
certainly
is
analogous
--
i
think
gay
people
are
far
weaker
than
the
women
were
at
the
time
of
frontiero.
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
to
flip
the
language
of
the
house
report,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
comes
from
a
moral
understanding
today
that
gay
people
are
no
different,
and
that
gay
married
couples'
relationships
are
not
significantly
different
from
the
relationships
of
straight
married
couples.
i
don't
think--
ms.
roberta
a.
kaplan
--i
--
i
think
it
came
--
is,
again
is
very
similar
to
the,
what
you
saw
between
bowers
and
lawrence.
i
think
it
came
to
a
societal
understanding.
i
don't
believe
that
societal
understanding
came
strictly
through
political
power;
and
i
don't
think
that
gay
people
today
have
political
power
as
that
--
this
court
has
used
that
term
with
--
in
connection
with
the
heightened
scrutiny
analysis.
