chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
12-307,
united
states
v.
windsor,
and
we
will
begin
with
the
jurisdictional
discussion.
ms.
jackson?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
thought--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
would
have
thought
your
answer
would
be
that
the
executive's
obligation
to
execute
the
law
includes
the
obligation
to
execute
the
law
consistent
with
the
constitution.
and
if
he
has
made
a
determination
that
executing
the
law
by
enforcing
the
terms
is
unconstitutional,
i
don't
see
why
he
doesn't
have
the
courage
of
his
convictions
and
execute
not
only
the
statute,
but
do
it
consistent
with
his
view
of
the
constitution,
rather
than
saying,
oh,
we'll
wait
till
the
supreme
court
tells
us
we
have
no
choice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
that
was
more
than
a
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
srinivasan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
first
one,
is
there
any
case
where
all
the
parties
agreed
with
the
decision
below
and
we
upheld
appellate
jurisdiction?
any
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
the
parties
agreed
with
the
decision
below
and
we
nonetheless
upheld
appellate
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
wasn't
raised
--
it
wasn't
raised
or
addressed,
and
that
had
the
distinct
situation
of
an
appeal,
direct
appeal
from
an
article
i
tribunal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
putting
lovett
aside,
since
none
of
this
was
discussed,
is
there
any,
any
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
is
totally
unprecedented.
you're
asking
us
to
do
something
we
have
never
done
before
to
reach
the
issue
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
not
just
--
it's
not
unusual.
it's
totally
unprecedented.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sometimes
you
do
and
sometimes
you
don't.
what
is
the
test
for
when
you
think
your
obligation
to
take
care
that
the
laws
be
faithfully
executed
means
you'll
follow
your
view
about
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not
or
you
won't
follow
your
view?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
say
we
shouldn't
be
concerned
about
that
part
of
chadha
because
the
issue
wasn't
joined
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
we
should
take
lovett
as
a
binding
precedent
even
though
the
issue
wasn't
addressed
at
all?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
--
what
if
you
disagree
with
--
the
executive
is
defending
one
of
your
laws,
if
that's
the
way
you
insist
on
viewing
it,
and
you
don't
like
their
arguments,
you
say,
they
are
not
making
the
best
argument.
is
that
a
situation
in
which
you
have
standing
to
intervene
to
defend
the
law
in
a
different
way
than
the
executive?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
jackson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
jackson,
before
you
sit
down,
i
would
like
to
note
that
you
briefed
and
argued
this
case
as
amicus
curiae
at
the
invitation
of
the
court,
and
you
have
ably
discharged
the
responsibility,
for
which
you
have
the
gratitude
of
the
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
we'll
now
take
a
very
short
break
and
turn
to
the
merits.
0
[recess.]
i
meant
that
we
would
take
a
break,
not
that
--
we
will
continue
argument
in
the
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
clement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
clement.
general
verrilli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
suppose
your
--
you
agree
that
congress
could
go
the
other
way,
right?
congress
could
pass
a
new
law
today
that
says,
we
will
give
federal
benefits.
when
we
say
“
marriage
”
in
federal
law,
we
mean
committed
same-sex
couples
as
well,
and
that
could
apply
across
the
board.
or
do
you
think
that
they
couldn't
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no,
my
point
is:
it
wouldn't
--
you
don't
think
it
would
raise
a
federalism
problem
either,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
just
to
be
clear,
you
don't
think
there
is
a
federalism
problem
with
what
congress
has
done
in
doma?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
so
it
would
be
central
to
the
inquiry
if
congress
went
the
other
way,
too?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that.
that's
your
equal
protection
argument.
it's
not
very
responsive
to
my
concern
i'm
trying
to
get
an
answer
to.
you
don't
think
federalism
concerns
come
into
play
at
all
in
this,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
the
equal
protection
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
as
soon
as
one
state
adopted
same
sex
marriage,
the
definition
of
marriage
throughout
the
federal
code
had
to
change?
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
up
until
that
point
every
time
congress
said
“
marriage
”
they
understood
they
were
acting
under
the
traditional
definition
of
marriage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
don't
think
that
when
congress
said
“
marriage
”
in
every
one
of
these
provisions
that
they
had
in
mind
same-sex
marriages?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
was
the
view
of
the
84
senators
who
voted
in
favor
of
it
and
the
president
who
signed
it?
they
were
motivated
by
animus?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
ms.
kaplan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
the
solicitor
general?
do
you
think
there
would
be
a
problem
if
congress
went
the
other
way,
the
federalism
problem?
obviously,
you
don't
think
there's
an
equal
protection
problem--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
a
federalism
issue,
congress
said,
we're
going
to
recognize
same-sex
couples
--
committed
same-sex
couples
--
even
if
the
state
doesn't,
for
purposes
of
federal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just
am
asking
whether
you
think
congress
has
the
power
to
interfere
with
the
--
to
not
adopt
the
state
definition
if
they're
extending
benefits.
do
they
have
that
authority?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
know
that.
you're
following
the
lead
of
the
solicitor
general
and
returning
to
the
equal
protection
clause
every
time
i
ask
a
federalism
question.
is
there
any
problem
under
federalism
principles?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
congress
passing
a
law
saying,
we
are
going
to
adopt
a
different
definition
of
marriage
than
those
states
that
don't
recognize
same-sex
marriage.
we
don't
care
whether
you
do
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
when
it
comes
to
federal
benefits,
same-sex
marriage
will
be
recognized.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
84
senators
--
it's
the
same
question
i
asked
before;
84
senators
based
their
vote
on
moral
disapproval
of
gay
people?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
--
times
can
blind.
does
that
mean
they
did
not
base
their
votes
on
moral
disapproval?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
suppose
the
sea
change
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
political
force
and
effectiveness
of
people
representing,
supporting
your
side
of
the
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
doubt
that
the
lobby
supporting
the
enactment
of
same
sex-marriage
laws
in
different
states
is
politically
powerful,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
really?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
political
figures
are
falling
over
themselves
to
endorse
your
side
of
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
just
referred
to
a
sea
change
in
people's
understandings
and
values
from
1996,
when
doma
was
enacted,
and
i'm
just
trying
to
see
where
that
comes
from,
if
not
from
the
political
effectiveness
of
--
of
groups
on
your
side
of
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that.
i
am
just
trying
to
see
how
--
where
that
that
moral
understanding
came
from,
if
not
the
political
effectiveness
of
a
particular
group.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
kaplan.
mr.
clement,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
case
12-307,
united
states
verus
windsor,
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court.
