mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
not
only
addressed
the
issue
of
the
house's
standing
in
chadha;
it
held
that
the
house
is
the
proper
party
to
defend
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
when
the
executive
agency
charged
with
its
enforcement
agrees
with
plaintiff
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure,
generally,
unless
and
until
they
stop
defending
it,
at
which
point
we
submit--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because
the
house
is
very
--
in
a
very
different
position
in
a
case
like
this
and
in
chadha
from
just
the
general
taxpayer.
now,
in
a
case
like
chadha,
for
example,
you're
right,
it
was
the
one-house
veto,
if
you
will,
that
was
at
issue.
but
it
would
be
a
strange
jurisprudence
that
says
that
the
house
has
standing
to
come
in
and
defend
an
unconstitutional
one-house
veto,
but
it
doesn't
have
standing
to
come
in
and
defend
its
core
article
i
prerogative,
which
is
to
pass
statutes
and
have
those
statutes--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
house--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--sure.
and
there
is
a
presumption
that
its
acts
are
constitutional.
that
presumption
had
real
life
here
because
when
congress
was
considering
this
statute
it
asked
the
justice
department
three
times
whether
doma
was
constitutional,
and
three
times
the
justice
department
told
them
that
it
was
in
fact
constitutional.
so
i
think
it's
a
fair
assumption
that
they
at
least
have
standing
to
have
that
determination
made
by
the
courts,
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
the
context
of
state
legislatures
and
the
courts
have--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
would
say
two
things.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant.
i
would
say
two
things.
one
is,
i
don't
think
there
was
anything
particularized
about
the
fact
that
it
was
the
house
that
exercised
the
one-house
veto,
because
the
court
allowed
the
senate
to
participate
as
well
and
the
senate's
interest
in
that
was
really
just
the
constitutionality
of
the
legislation
and
perhaps
the
one-house
veto
going
forward.
but
what
i
would
say
is
i
just
--
i
would
continue
to
resist
the
premise,
which
is
that
the
house's
prerogatives
aren't
at
stake
here.
the
house's
single
most
important
prerogative,
which
is
to
pass
legislation
and
have
that
legislation,
if
it's
going
to
be
repealed,
only
be
repealed
through
a
process
where
the
house
gets
to
fully
participate.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no,
i
would
say
we
would
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
say
in
that
circumstance
the
house
would
have
the
prerogative
to
file
an
amicus
brief
if
it
wanted
to,
but
that's
because
of
a
sound
prudential
reason,
which
is
when
the
executive
is
actually
discharging
its
responsibility,
its
traditional
obligation
to
defend
an
act
of
congress,
if
congress
comes
in
as
a
party
it
has
the
possibility
of
second-guessing
the
way
that
they
are
actually
defending
it.
but
if
the
executive
is
going
to
vacate
the
premises
or,
in
a
case
like
this,
not
just
vacate
the
premises,
but
stay
in
court
and
attack
the
statute,
you
don't
have
that
prudential
concern.
and
that's
why--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
--
if
in
a
particular
case,
which
is
obviously
not
this
case,
the
executive
decides,
we
are
not
going
to
defend
the
statute
as
applied
i
think
in
that
situation
the
house
could
come
in.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
practice
it
probably
wouldn't.
and
it's
not
like
the
house
and
the
senate
are
very
anxious
to
exercise
this
prerogative.
in
the
30
years
since
the
chadha
decision,
there's
only
been
12
instances
in
which
the
--
in
which
the
house
has
come
in
and
intervened
as
a
party.
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
recognize
that
whatever--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
includes
all
courts,
but
excluding
the
doma
cases.
so
from
the
point
of
chadha
until
the
doma
cases,
there
were
a
total
of
12
cases
where
the
house
intervened
as
a
party.
and
i
do
think
that
particularly
in
the
lower
court
cases,
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
party
status
is
critical.
i
mean,
in
this
case
it
doesn't
make
a
huge
differences
if
you
are
an
amicus
with
argument
time
versus
a
party.
but
in
the
district
court
that
makes
all
the
difference.
only
a
party
can
take
a
deposition.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
would
--
a
couple
of
things,
justice
breyer.
i
mean,
i
would
point
you
to
chadha
and
i
realize
you
can
distinguish
chadha.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
if
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
it's
understandable.
i--
mean,
obviously
nobody's
suggesting,
at
least
in
the
legislative
branch,
that
this
is
a
best
practices
situation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
can
point
to
you
a
couple
of
cases
that
will
help
but
may
not
be
a
complete
solution
for
some
of
the
reasons
you
built
into
your
question.
the
cases
i
would
point
to
help
are
coleman
v.
miller,
karcher
v.
may,
and
arizonans
for
official
english.
and
all
of
those
--
i
don't
think
coleman
involved
any
specific
legislative
authorization,
but
you
can
distinguish
it,
i
suppose.
but
in
trying
to
distinguish
it,
keep
in
mind
that
this
court
gave
those
20
senators
not
just
standing
to
make
the
argument
about
the
role
of
the
lieutenant
governor,
but
also
gave
them
standing
to
make
the
separate
argument,
which
is
the
only
one
this
court
reached,
because
it
was
divided
four
to
four
on
the
lieutenant
governor's
role,
the
only
issue
that
the
court
reached
is
the
issue
whether
prior
ratification
disabled
them
from
subsequent
legislation
action,
which
is
just
a
way
of
saying
what
they
did
was
unconstitutional.
so
i
think
coleman
is
quite
close.
karcher,
arizonans
against
english,
there
was
an
authorization.
we
would
say
h.
res.
5
is
enough
of
authorization
for
these
purposes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
can
point
you
to
two
places.
one
is
the
house
rules
that
are
pursuant
to
the
rulemaking
authority
and
approved
by
the
institution.
they're
approved
in
every
congress.
rule
2.8.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i'm
not
sure
there
is
another
one,
but
that's
the
sole
purpose
of
rule
2.8.
it
creates
the
office
of
the
general
counsel--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
sotomayor.
that's
the
same
authority
that
gave
the
house,
essentially
a
predecessor
to
it
--
it
would
be
the
same
authority
that
has
had
the
house
appear
in
litigation
ever
since
chadha.
in
chadha
there
was
a
vote
that
authorized
it
specifically,
but
we
have
that
here
in
h.
res.
5,
which
is
the
second
place
i
would
point
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
we
do.
we
do
have
a
vote
in
h.
res.
5.
at
the
beginning
of
this
congress
in
january,
the
house
passed
a
resolution
that
passed,
that
authorized
the
blag
to
continue
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
house
in
this
particular
litigation.
so
i
think
if
there
was
a
question
before
h.
res.
5,
there
shouldn't
be
now.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
justice
kennedy,
they
wouldn't
have
the
standing
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
this
case.
they
would
have
standing
to
be
on
the
same
side
of
this
case,
and
i
think
that's
essentially
what
you
had
happen
in
the
chadha
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
--
because
it
wouldn't
have
the
authority
to
do
so
under
chadha.
what
--
chadha
makes
the
critical
flipping
of
the
switch
that
gives
the
house
the
ability
to
intervene
as
a
party
is
that
the
executive
branch
declines
to
defend
the
statute.
so
if
the
senate
wants
to
come
in
and
basically
take
--
share
argument
time
or
something
as
an
amicus,
they
can,
but
there's
no
need
for
them
to
participate
as
--
as
a
party.
and
i
would
want
to
emphasize
that
in
the
lower
courts,
participation
by
a
party
is
absolutely
critical.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
have
the
party
that
wants
to
see
the
statute
invalidated
be
in
charge
of
the
litigation
in
the
district
courts,
because
whether
the
statute
is
going
to
be
invalidated
is
going
to
depend
on
what
kind
of
record
there
is
in
the
district
court.
it'd
be
one
thing,
justice
scalia,
if
all
that
happened
is
they
entered
consent
judgment.
i
suppose
then
the
thing
would
end,
and
then
in
the
long
run,
the
executive
would
be
forced
to
do
their
job
and
actually
defend
these
statutes--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
if
that's
not
going
to
happen--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
alito,
i
think
it
makes
perfect
sense
in
this
context,
because
every
--
each
individual
house
has
a
constitutional
rule
before
a
statute
is
repealed.
and
so
yes,
it
takes
two
of
them
to
make
the
law.
but
each
of
their's
participation
is
necessary
to
repeal
a
law.
so
if
the
executive
wants
to
go
into
court
and
effectively
seek
the
judicial
repeal
of
a
law,
it
makes
sense
that
one
house
can
essentially
vindicate
its
role
in
our
constitutional
scheme
by
saying,
wait
a
minute,
we
passed
that
law;
it
can't
be
repealed
without
our
participation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't
think
that's
right
after
raines,
justice
alito.
in
raines,
this
court
carefully
distinguished
between
the
situation
of
an
individual
legislator
and
the
situation
of
one
of
the
houses
as
a
whole.
and
it
specifically
said
this
might
be
a
different
case
if
we
had
that
kind
of
vote.
and
that's
what
you
have
here.
that's
what
you
had
in
chadha.
and
again,
i
do
think
that
--
i
mean,
the
only
alternatives
here
are
really
to
say
that
the
executive
absolutely
must
enforce
these
laws,
and
if
they
don't,
i
mean,
because
after
all
--
you
know,
i
--
i
really
don't
understand
why
it's
--
if
they're
not
going
to
--
if
they've
made
a
determination
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional,
why
it
makes
any
sense
for
them
to
continue
to
enforce
the
law
and
put
executive
officers
in
the
position
of
doing
something
that
the
president
has
determined
is
unconstitutional.
i
mean,
think
about
the
qualified
immunity
implications
of
that
for
a
minute.
so
that's
problematic
enough.
but
if
they're
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
and
get
anything
more
than
a
consent
judgment,
then
the
house
is
going
to
have
to
be
able
to
play
its
role,
and
it's
going
to
have
to
play
the
role
of
a
party.
an
amicus
just
doesn't
get
it
done.
and
i
really
think,
in
a
sense,
the
executive
gives
the
game
away
by
conceding
that
our
participation
as
an
amicus
here
is
necessary
to
solve
what
would
otherwise
be
a
glaring
adverseness
problem.
because
once
you
recognize
that
we
can
participate
as
an
amicus,
you've
essentially
recognized
that
there's
nothing
inherently
executive
about
coming
in
and
defending
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress.
or
more
to
the
point,
there's
nothing
inherently
unlegislative
about
coming
in
and
making
arguments
in
defense
of
the
statute.
and
if
that's
critical,
absolutely
necessary
to
ensure
there's
an
adverse
presentation
of
the
issues,
well,
there's
no
reason
the
house
should
have
to
do
that
with
one
hand
tied
behind
its
back.
if
its
participation
is
necessary,
it
should
participate
as
a
full
party.
and
as
i
say,
that's
critically
important
in
the
lower
courts
so
they
can
take
depositions,
build
a
factual
record,
and
allow
for
a
meaningful
defense
of
the
statute.
because
the
alternative
really
puts
the
executive
branch
in
an
impossible
position.
it's
a
conflict
of
interest.
they're
the
ones
that
are
making
litigation
decisions
to
promote
the
defense
of
a
statute
they
want
to
see
invalidated.
and
if
you
want
to
see
the
problems
with
their
position,
look
at
joint
appendix
page
437.
you
will
see
the
most
anomalous
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
history
of
litigation:
a
motion
to
dismiss,
filed
by
the
united
states,
asking
the
district
court
not
to
dismiss
the
case.
i
mean,
that's
what
you
get
under
their
view
of
the
world,
and
that
doesn't
serve
as
separation
of
powers.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
it
--
it
does.
it
does.
and
then
--
you
know
--
and
the
last
thing
i'll
say
is,
we
saw
in
this
case
certain
appeals
were
expedited,
certain
appeals
weren't.
they
did
not
serve
the
interest
of
defending
the
statute,
they
served
the
distinct
interest
of
the
executive.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
of
same-sex
marriage
certainly
implicates
profound
and
deeply
held
views
on
both
sides
of
the
issue,
but
the
legal
question
on
the
merits
before
this
court
is
actually
quite
narrow.
on
the
assumption
that
states
have
the
constitutional
option
either
to
define
marriage
in
traditional
terms
or
to
recognize
same-sex
marriages
or
to
adopt
a
compromise
like
civil
unions,
does
the
federal
government
have
the
same
flexibility
or
must
the
federal
government
simply
borrow
the
terms
in
state
law?
i
would
submit
the
basic
principles
of
federalism
suggest
that
as
long
as
the
federal
government
defines
those
terms
solely
for
purposes
of
federal
law,
that
the
federal
government
has
the
choice
to
adopt
a
constitutionally
permissible
definition
or
to
borrow
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
justice
ginsburg,
would
be
to
say
that
that
is
a
marriage
under
state
law,
and
i
think
this
court's
cases
when
it
talks
about
the
fundamental
right
to
marriage,
i
take
it
to
be
talking
about
the
state
law
status
of
marriage;
and
the
question
of
what
does
that
mean
for
purposes
of
federal
law
has
always
been
understood
to
be
a
different
matter.
and
that's
been
true
certainly
in
a
number
of
situations
under
a
number
of
statutes,
so
it's
simply
not
the
case
that
as
long
as
you
are
married
under
state
law
you
absolutely
are
going
to
be
treated
as
married--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
we've
never
had
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
when
it
comes
to
divorce,
because
with
divorce
uniquely,
you
could
have
the
--
possibility
that
somebody's
married
to
two
different
people
for
purposes
of
state
law
and
federal
law.
but
with
the
basic
question
of
even
whether
to
recognize
the
marriage
--
or
probably
the
best
way
to
put
it
is
just
whether
the
federal
law
treats
you
as
married
for
a
particular
purpose
or
not,
there
always
have
been
differences
between
the
federal
law
treatment
and
the
state
law
treatment.
the
federal
treatment,
for
example,
recognizes
common
law
marriages
in
all
states
whereas
a
lot
of
states
don't
recognize
common
law
marriages,
but
federal
law
recognizes
that
for
some
purposes
--
the
social
security
act,
i
think
it's
at
page
4
of
our
brief.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
don't
think
that
is
true
for
purposes
of
that
provision.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
that's
my
understanding,
that's
--
as
discussed--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--my
understanding
is
that
there
is
a
federal
--
that
the
federal
law
recognizes
in
--
in
the
social
security
context
even
if
it
doesn't;
and
in
all
events,
there
are
other
situations
--
immigration
context,
tax
consequences.
for
tax
consequences,
if
you
get
a
divorce
every
december,
you
know,
for
tax
consequences,
the
state
may
well
recognize
that
divorce.
the
federal
government
has
long
said,
look,
we
are
not
going
to
allow
you
get
a
divorce
every
december
just
to
get
remarried
in
january
so
you'll
have
a
filing
tax
status
that
works
for
you
that
is
more
favorable
to
you.
so
the
federal
government
has
always
treated
this
somewhat
distinctly;
it
always
has
its
own
efforts;
and
i
do
think
for
purposes
of
the
federalism
issue,
it
really
matters
that
all
doma
does
is
take
this
term
where
it
appears
in
federal
law
and
define
it
for
purposes
of
federal
law.
it
would
obviously
be
a
radically
different
case
if
congress
had,
in
1996,
decided
to
try
to
stop
states
from
defining
marriage
in
a
particular
way
or
dictate
how
they
would
decide
it
in
that
way.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
two
points.
first
of
all,
the
very
fact
that
there
are
1,100
provisions
of
federal
law
that
define
the
terms
“
marriage
”
and
“
spouse
”
goes
a
long
way
to
showing
that
federal
law
has
not
just
stayed
completely
out
of
these
issues.
it's
gotten
involved
in
them
in
a
variety
of
contexts
where
there
is
an
independent
federal
power
that
supported
that.
now,
the
second
thing
is
the
fact
that
doma
affects
all
1,100
statutes
at
once
is
not
really
a
sign
of
its
irrationality.
it
is
a
sign
that
what
it
is,
and
all
it
has
ever
purported
to
be,
is
a
definitional
provision.
and
like
every
other
provision
in
the
dictionary
act,
what
it
does
is
it
defines
the
term
wherever
it
appears
in
federal
law
in
a
consistent
way.
and
that
was
part
and
parcel
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
with
doma
in
1996.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
that's
true
but
i
don't
think
that's
a
mark
against
it
for
federalism
purposes,
and
it
--
it
addressed
a
particular
issue
at
a
point,
remember
in
1996,
congress
is
addressing
this
issue
because
they
are
thinking
that
the
state
of
hawaii
through
its
judicial
action
is
about
to
change
the
definition
of
marriage
from
a
way
that
it
had
been
defined
in
every
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states.
and
what
that
meant
is
that
when
congress
passed
every
one
of
the
statutes
affected
by
doma's
definition,
the
congress
that
was
passing
that
statute
had
in
mind
the
traditional
definition.
and
so
congress
in
1996
at
that
point
says,
the
states
are
about
to
experiment
with
changing
this,
but
the
one
thing
we
know
is
all
these
federal
statutes
were
passed
with
the
traditional
definition
in
mind.
and
if
rational
basis
is
the
test,
it
has
to
be
rational
for
congress
then
to
say,
well,
we
are
going
to
reaffirm
what
this
word
has
always
meant
for
purposes
of
federal
law.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
for
these
purposes
actually,
justice
alito,
if
you
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
estate
tax
deduction,
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
trying
to
provide
uniform
treatment
of
taxpayers
across
jurisdictions,
and
if
you
look
at
the
brief
that
senator
hatch
and
some
other
senators
filed,
they
discussed
this
history,
because
what
was
happening
in
1948
when
this
provision
was
initially
put
into
federal
law
was
you
had
community
property
states
and
common
law
states,
and
actually
there
was
much
more
favorable
tax
treatment
if
you
were
in
a
community
law
state
than
a
common
law
state.
and
congress
didn't
want
to
have
an
artificial
incentive
for
states
to
move
from
common
law
to
community
property;
it
wanted
to
treat
citizens
the
same
way
no
matter
what
state
they
were
in.
so
it
said,
we
will
give
a
uniform
federal
deduction
based
on
marriage,
and
i
think
what
that
shows
is
that
when
the
federal
government
gets
involved
in
the
issue
of
marriage,
it
has
a
particularly
acute
interest
in
uniform
treatment
of
people
across
state
lines.
so
ms.
windsor
wants
to
point
to
the
unfairness
of
the
differential
treatment
of
treating
two
new
york
married
couples
differently,
and
of
course
for
purposes
of
new
york
law
that's
exactly
the
right
focus,
but
for
purposes
of
federal
law
it's
much
more
rational
for
congress
to
--
to
say,
and
certainly
a
rational
available
choice,
for
congress
to
say,
we
want
to
treat
the
same-sex
couple
in
new
york
the
same
way
as
the
committed
same-sex
couple
in
oklahoma
and
treat
them
the
same.
or
even
more
to
the
point
for
purposes--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
--
but
the
only
way--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--but
the
--
the
only
way
they
are
different
is
because
of
the
way
the
state
law
treats
them.
and
just
to
be
clear
how
--
you
know,
what
this
case
is
about,
and
how
sort
of
anomalous
the
--
the
treatment,
the
differential
treatment
in
two
states
is,
is
this
is
not
a
case
that
is
based
on
a
marriage
license
issued
directly
by
the
state
of
new
york
after
2011
when
new
york
recognized
same-sex
marriage.
this
is
--
the
status
of
ms.
windsor
as
married
depends
on
new
york's
recognition
of
an
ontario
marriage
certificate
issued
in
2007.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
guess
i
would
--
i
would
say
two
things.
i
would
say
that
the
first
question
would
be
what's
the
relevant
level
of
scrutiny
and
i
assume
the
level
of
scrutiny
for
the
things--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--again,
i
think
the
right
way
to
analyze
it
would
be,
you
know,
is
--
is
there
any
distinction
drawn
that
implicates
what
level
of
scrutiny
is
implicated.
if
the
level
of
scrutiny
is
a
rational
basis,
then
my
answer
to
you
would
be,
yes,
they
can
do
that.
i
mean,
we'd
have
to
talk
about
what
the
rational
basis
would
be--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
--
i
think
the
uniform
treatment
of
individuals
across
state
lines--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
i
see
exactly
where
you're
going,
justice
breyer.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
and
--
and
obviously,
every
one
of
those
cases
would
have
to
be
decided
on
its
own.
but
i
do
think
there
is
a
powerful
interest
when
the
federal
government
classifies
people--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--there's
a
powerful
interest
in
treating--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
again,
if
we're
--
if
we're
coming
at
this
from
the
premise
that
the
states
have
the
option
to
choose,
and
then
we
come
at
this
from
the
perspective
that
congress
is
passing
this
not
in
a
vacuum,
they're
passing
this
in
1996.
and
what
they're
confronting
in
1996
is
the
prospect
that
one
state,
through
its
judiciary,
will
adopt
same-sex
marriage
and
then
by
operation
of
the
through
full
faith
and
credit
law,
that
will
apply
to
any
--
any
couple
that
wants
to
go
there.
and
the
state
that's
thinking
about
doing
this
is
hawaii;
it's
a
very
nice
place
to
go
and
get
married.
and
so
congress
is
worried
that
people
are
going
to
go
there,
go
back
to
their
home
jurisdictions,
insist
on
the
recognition
in
their
home
jurisdictions
of
their
same-sex
marriage
in
hawaii,
and
then
the
federal
government
will
borrow
that
definition,
and
therefore,
by
the
operation
of
one
state's
state
judiciary,
same-sex
marriage
is
basically
going
to
be
recognized
throughout
the
country.
and
what
congress
says
is,
wait
a
minute.
let's
take
a
timeout
here.
this
is
a
redefinition
of
an
age-old
institution.
let's
take
a
more
cautious
approach
where
every
sovereign
gets
to
do
this
for
themselves.
and
so
section
2
of
doma
says
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
on
full
faith
and
credit
principles
that
a
decision
of
one
state--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
at
least
two
--
two
responses
to
that,
justice
sotomayor.
first
is
that
one
interest
that
supports
the
federal
government's
definition
of
this
term
is
whatever
federal
interest
justifies
the
underlying
statute
in
which
it
appears.
so,
in
every
one
of
these
statutes
that
affected,
by
assumption,
there's
some
article
i
section
8
authority--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--just
to
clarify,
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
federal
government
has
any
special
authority
to
recognize
traditional
marriage.
so
if
--
the
assumption
is
that
nobody
can
do
it.
if
the
states
can't
do
it
either,
then
the
federal
government
can't
do
it.
so
the
federal
government--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--okay.
so
then
the
question
assuming
--
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--so
then,
if
the
states
can--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--the
federal
government
has
sort
of
two
sets
of
authorities
that
give
it
sort
of
a
legitimate
interest
to
wade
into
this
debate.
now,
one
is
whatever
authority
gives
rise
to
the
underlying
statute.
the
second
and
complementary
authority
is
that,
you
know,
the
federal
government
recognizes
that
it's
a
big
player
in
the
world,
that
it
has
a
lot
of
programs
that
might
give
states
incentives
to
change
the
rules
one
way
or
another.
and
the
best
way
--
one
way
to
stay
out
of
the
debate
and
let
just
the
--
the
states
develop
this
and
let
the
democratic
process
deal
with
this
is
to
just
say,
look,
we're
going
to
stick
with
what
we've
always
had,
which
is
traditional
definition.
we're
not
going
to
create
a
regime
that
gives
people
an
incentive
and
point
to
federal
law
and
say,
well,
another
reason
you
should
have
same-sex
marriage
is
because
then
you'll
get
a
state
tax
deduction.
they
stayed
out
of
it.
they've
said,
look,
we're--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--no,
no.
they
treat
them
--
which
is
to
say
they
--
they
are
preserving,
they
are
helping
the
states
in
the
sense
of
having
each
sovereign
make
this
decision
for
themselves.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
justice
kennedy,
that's
not
right.
no
state
loses
any
benefits
by
recognizing
same-sex
marriage.
things
stay
the
same.
what
they
don't
do
is
they
don't
sort
of
open
up
an
additional
class
of
beneficiaries
under
their
state
law
for
--
that
get
additional
federal
benefits.
but
things
stay
the
same.
and
that's
why
in
this
sense--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--with
respect,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
not
what
the
federal
government
is
saying.
the
federal
government
is
saying
that
within
its
own
realm
in
federal
policies,
where
we
assume
that
the
federal
government
has
the
authority
to
define
the
terms
that
appear
in
their
own
statute,
that
in
those
areas,
they
are
going
to
have
their
own
definition.
and
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--a
couple
of
responses,
justice
kagan.
first
of
all,
i
think
i
would
take
issue
with
the
premise,
first
of
all,
that
this
is
such
an
unusual
federal
involvement
on
an
issue
like
marriage.
if
you
look
at
historically,
not
only
has
the
federal
government
defined
marriage
for
its
own
purposes
distinctly
in
the
context
of
particular
--
particular
programs,
it's
also
intervened
in
--
in
other
areas,
including
in-state
prerogatives.
i
mean,
there's
a
reason
that
four
state
constitutions
include
a
prohibition
on
polygamy.
it's
because
the
federal
congress
insisted
on
them.
there
is
a
reason
that,
in
the
wake
of
the
civil
war
and
in
reconstruction,
congress
specifically
wanted
to
provide
benefits
for
spouses
of
freed
slaves
who
fought
for
the
union.
in
order
to
do
it,
it
essentially
had
to
create
state
law
marriages,
because
in
the
confederacy,
the
slaves
couldn't
get
married.
so
they
developed
their
own
state
--
essentially,
a
federal,
sort
of,
condition
to
define
who
was
married
under
those
laws.
so
where
there
was
the
needs
in
the
past
to
get
involved,
the
federal
government
has
got
involved.
the
other
point
i
would
make
--
but
i
also
eventually
want
to
get
around
to
the
animus
point
--
but
the
other
point
i
would
make
is:
when
you
look
at
congress
doing
something
that
is
unusual,
that
deviates
from
the
way
they
--
they
have
proceeded
in
the
past,
you
have
to
ask,
well,
was
there
good
reason?
and
in
a
sense,
you
have
to
understand
that,
in
1996,
something's
happening
that
is,
in
a
sense,
forcing
congress
to
choose
between
its
historic
practice
of
deferring
to
the
states
and
its
historic
practice
of
preferring
uniformity.
up
until
1996,
it
essentially
has
it
both
ways:
every
state
has
the
traditional
definition.
congress
knows
that's
the
definition
that's
embedded
in
every
federal
law.
so
that's
fine.
we
can
defer.
okay.
1996--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--does
the
house
report
say
that?
of
course,
the
house
report
says
that.
and
if
that's
enough
to
invalidate
the
statute,
then
you
should
invalidate
the
statute.
but
that
has
never
been
your
approach,
especially
under
rational
basis
or
even
rational
basis-plus,
if
that
is
what
you
are
suggesting.
this
court,
even
when
it's
to
find
more
heightened
scrutiny,
the
o'brien
case
we
cite,
it
suggests,
look,
we
are
not
going
to
strike
down
a
statute
just
because
a
couple
of
legislators
may
have
had
an
improper
motive.
we're
going
to
look,
and
under
rational
basis,
we
look:
is
there
any
rational
basis
for
the
statute?
and
so,
sure,
the
house
report
says
some
things
that
we
are
not
--
we've
never
invoked
in
trying
to
defend
the
statute.
but
the
house
report
says
other
things,
like
congress
was
trying
to
promote
democratic
self-governance.
and
in
a
situation
where
an
unelected
state
judiciary
in
hawaii
is
on
the
verge
of
deciding
this
highly
contentious,
highly
divisive
issue
for
everybody,
for
the
states
--
for
the
other
states
and
for
the
federal
government
by
borrowing
principle,
it
makes
sense
for
congress--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that's
true.
i
--
but
again,
i
don't
know
that
that
fact
alone
makes
it
irrational.
and
i
suppose
if
that's
what
you
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
--
i
think
there
is
so
clearly
is
a
federal
power
because
doma
doesn't
define
any
term
that
appears
anywhere
other
than
in
a
federal
statute
that
we
assume
that
there
is
federal
power
for.
and
if
there
is
not
federal
power
for
the
statutes
in
which
these
terms
appear,
that
is
a
problem
independent
of
doma,
but
it
is
not
a
doma
problem.
so
i
will
assume
we
have
federal
power.
then
the
question
is--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
it
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
regulate
marriages,
as
such,
but
that's
not
what
doma
does.
doma
provides
certain
--
doma
defines
a
term
as
it
appears
in
federal
statutes,
many
of
those
federal
statutes
provide
benefits.
some
of
those
federal
statutes
provide
burdens.
some
of
those
federal
statutes
provide
disclosure
obligations.
it
appears
in
lots
of
places,
and
if
any
one
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--that
would
make
no
difference,
justice
alito.
it
does
--
the
hypothetical
helpfully
demonstrates,
though,
that
when
the
federal
government
is
defining
this
term
as
it
appears
in
the
federal
code,
it
is
not
regulating
marriage
as
such.
and
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
people
that
are
married
in
their
state,
based
on
either
the
legislative
acts
or
by
judicial
recognition,
remain
married
for
purposes
of
state
law.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
--
i
think
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
the
point
about
the
courts,
though,
is
--
i
mean,
it's
particularly
relevant
here.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
let
me
--
let
me
just
get
on
record
that
--
to
take
issue
with
one
of
the
premises
of
this,
which
is
we
are
at
somehow
rational
basis-plus
land,
because
i
would
suggest
strongly
that
three
levels
of
scrutiny
are
enough.
but
in
all
events,
if
you
are
thinking
about
the
justifications
that
defend
this
statute,
that
justify
the
statute,
they
are
obviously
in
the
brief.
but
it's
uniformity
--
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
just
that
congress
picked
this,
you
know,
we
need
a
uniform
term,
let's
pick
this
out
of
the
air.
they
picked
the
traditional
definition
that
they
knew
reflected
the
underlying
judgments
of
every
federal
statute
on
the
books
at
that
point.
they
knew
it
was
the
definition
that
had
been
tried
in
every
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
and
hadn't
been
tried
anywhere
until
2004.
and
then,
of
course,
it
was,
as
they
correctly
predicted,
a
judicial
decision.
and
in
this
context,
in
particular,
they
are
thinking
about
an
individual
--
i
mean,
this
couple
goes
to
ontario,
they
get
the
--
they
get
a
marriage
certificate.
a
couple
could
--
from
oklahoma,
could
have
gotten
--
gone
to
ontario
and
gotten
a
marriage
certificate
that
same
day
and
gone
back
to
oklahoma.
and
from
the
federal
law
perspective,
there
is
certainly
a
rational
basis
in
treating
those
two
couples
the
same
way.
if
i
could
reserve
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
three
points
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
the
solicitor
general
concede
that
there
is
no
unique
federalism
problem
with
doma,
because
in
the
gill
litigation
in
the
first
circuit,
the
state
of
massachusetts
--
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
invoked
the
tenth
amendment,
and
on
that
issue
the
united
states
continued
to
defend
doma
because
there
is
no
unique
federalism
problem
with
it,
as
the
chief
justice's
question
suggested.
if
10
years
from
now
there
are
only
9
states
left
and
congress
wants
to
adopt
a
uniform
federal
law
solely
for
federal
law
purposes
to
going
the
other
way,
it
is
fully
entitled
to
do
that.
it
has
the
power
to
do
that.
i
would
say
also
the
federal
government
has
conceded
in
this
litigation
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
this
statute,
something
else
to
keep
in
mind.
i
would
also
say
that
this
provision
is
not
so
unique.
the
very
next
provision
in
the
dictionary
act--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and,
justice
ginsburg,
applying
rational
basis
to
doma,
i
think
that
there
are
many
rational
bases
that
support
it.
and
the
solicitor
general
says,
well,
you
know,
the
united
states
is
not
the
51st
state
to
be
sure,
but
the
federal
government
has
interests
in
uniformity
that
no
other
entity
has.
and
we
heard
today
that
there's
a
problem;
when
somebody
moves
from
new
york
to
north
carolina,
they
can
lose
their
benefits.
the
federal
government
uniquely,
unlike
the
50
states,
can
say,
well,
that
doesn't
make
any
sense,
we
are
going
to
have
the
same
rule.
we
don't
want
somebody,
if
they
are
going
to
be
transferred
in
the
military
from
west
point
to
fort
sill
in
oklahoma,
to
resist
the
transfer
because
they
are
going
to
lose
some
benefits.
it
makes
sense
to
have
a
uniform
federal
rule
for
the
federal
government.
it
is
not
so
anomalous
that
the
term
“
marriage
”
is
defined
in
the
u.s.
code.
the
very
next
provision
of
the
dictionary
act
defines
“
child
”.
these
terms,
although
they
are
the
primary
province
of
state
governments,
do
appear
in
multiple
federal
statutes
and
it's
a
federal
role
to
define
those
terms.
the
last
point
i
would
simply
make
is
in
thinking
about
animus,
think
about
the
fact
that
congress
asked
the
justice
department
three
times
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
that's
not
what
you
do
when
you
are
motivated
by
animus.
the
first
two
times
they
got
back
the
answer
it
was
constitutional.
the
third
time,
they
asked
again
in
the
wake
of
romer,
and
they
got
the
same
answer:
it's
constitutional.
now
the
solicitor
general
wants
to
say:
well,
it
was
want
of
careful
reflection?
well,
where
do
we
get
careful
reflection
in
our
system?
generally,
careful
reflection
comes
in
the
democratic
process.
the
democratic
process
requires
people
to
persuade
people.
the
reason
there
has
been
a
sea
change
is
a
combination
of
political
power,
as
defined
by
this
court's
cases
as
getting
the
attention
of
lawmakers;
certainly
they
have
that.
but
it's
also
persuasion.
that's
what
the
democratic
process
requires.
you
have
to
persuade
somebody
you're
right.
you
don't
label
them
a
bigot.
you
don't
label
them
as
motivated
by
animus.
you
persuade
them
you
are
right.
that's
going
on
across
the
country.
colorado,
the
state
that
brought
you
amendment
2,
has
just
recognized
civil
unions.
maine,
that
was
pointed
to
in
the
record
in
this
case
as
being
evidence
of
the
persistence
of
discrimination
because
they
voted
down
a
statewide
referendum,
the
next
election
cycle
it
came
out
the
other
way.
and
the
federal
congress
is
not
immune.
they
repealed
“
don't
ask,
don't
tell
”.
allow
the
democratic
process
to
continue.
thank
you,
your
honor.
