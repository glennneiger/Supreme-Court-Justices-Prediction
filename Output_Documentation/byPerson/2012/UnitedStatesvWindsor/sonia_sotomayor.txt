justice
sonia
sotomayor
who
else
is
going
to
be
aggrieved
if
she
is
not?
meaning
another
person
who
is
--
whose
benefits
are
withheld,
tax
refund
is
withheld,
is
going
to
be
in
an
identical
situation
to
her?
who
else
could
come
in?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
you
not
run
out
of
time
on
the
blag
standing?
i
know
we
--
we
didn't
permit
ms.
jackson
to
--
to
address
it.
so
don't
run
out
of
time
on
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
let's
go
to
the
blag
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
issue
wasn't
joined.
so
what
do
you
think
we
meant?
and
i
know
justice
scalia
doesn't
care
what
you
think
we
meant.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
is
your
reading
of
what
that
means,
that
congress
can--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--intervene
in
situations
in
which
its
interests
are
injured?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
accepting
the
amici's
formulation
that
somehow
the
representative
has
to
be
of
both
houses
and
not
just
one?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
take
the
position
that
congress--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
i
want
to
know
what
you're
conceding.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
this
very
case.
would
--
who
would
ever
have
standing
on
behalf
of
congress?
anyone?
or
are
you
saying
there's
never
standing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
clement,
chadha
was
somewhat
different
because
there
was
a
unique
house
prerogative
in
question.
but
how
is
this
case
any
different
than
enforcing
the
general
laws
of
the
united
states?
there's
no
unique
house
power
granted
by
the
legislation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
a
law
of
the
united
states
and
the
person
who
defends
it
generally
is
the
solicitor
--
solicitor
general.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
then,
why
shouldn't
--
why
shouldn't
taxpayers
have
a
right
to
come
in?
and
we
say
they
don't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
where
the
authorization
is
here?
i
know
that
there
is
a
statute
that
gives
the
senate
specifically
authorization
to
intervene
and
that
there
was
consideration
of
extending
that
right
to
the
house.
but
the
appointment
of
blag
is
strange
to
me,
because
it's
not
in
a
statute,
it's
in
a
house
rule.
so
where
--
how
does
that
constitute
anything
other
than
a
private
agreement
among
some
senators,
the
house
leadership?
and
where
--
from
where
do
they
derive
the
right,
the
statutory
right,
to
take
on
the
power
of
representing
the
house
in
items
outside
of
the
house?
i
know
they
control
the
procedures
within
the
house,
but
that's
a
very
different
step
from
saying
that
they
can
decide
who
or
to
create
standing
in
some
way,
prudential
or
otherwise,
article
iii
or
otherwise.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
other
house
rule
creates
the
power
of
the
majority
leaders
to
represent
the
house
outside
of
the
functions
of
the
house?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
would
be,
i
think,
sort
of
unheard
of,
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--we
don't
even
have
a
vote
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
only
if
the
state
recognizes
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
there
is
a
common
law,
federal
common
law
definition?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
it
was
reverse,
that
if
the
state
law
recognized
common
law
marriages,
the
federal
law--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that's
begging
the
question,
because
you
are
treating
the
married
couples
differently.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
saying
that
new
york's
married
couples
are
different
than
nebraska's.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
picked
that
out
of
a
hat.
but
the
point
is
that
there
is
a
difference.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
gives
the
federal
government
the
right
to
be
concerned
at
all
at
what
the
definition
of
marriage
is?
sort
of
going
in
a
circle.
you're
saying
--
you're
saying,
we
can
create
this
special
category
--
men
and
women
--
because
the
states
have
an
interest
in
traditional
marriage
that
they're
trying
to
protect.
how
do
you
get
the
federal
government
to
have
the
right
to
create
categories
of
that
type
based
on
an
interest
that's
not
there,
but
based
on
an
interest
that
belongs
to
the
states?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
can
create
a
class
they
don't
like
--
here,
homosexuals
--
or
a
class
that
they
consider
is
suspect
in
the
marriage
category,
and
they
can
create
that
class
and
decide
benefits
on
that
basis
when
they
themselves
have
no
interest
in
the
actual
institution
of
marriage
as
marriage.
the
state's
control
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i'm
--
i'm--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--assuming
i
assume
the
states
can--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
creates
the
right--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general
verrilli,
i
have
a
question.
you
think,
i
think
from
your
brief
yesterday
and
today,
that
on
some
level
sexual
orientation
should
be
looked
on
an
intermediate
standard
of
scrutiny?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right,
heightened
in
some
way.
going
back
to
the
chief's
question
about
a
law
that
was
passed
recognizing
common
law
heterosexual
--
homosexual
marriages.
i
think
even
under
your
theory
that
might
be
suspect
because
--
that
law
might
be
suspect
under
equal
protection,
because
once
we
say
sexual
orientation
is
suspect,
it
would
be
suspect
whether
it's
homosexual
or
heterosexual.
the
law
favors
homosexuals;
it
would
be
suspect
because
it's
based
on
sexual
orientation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
and
so
when
we
decided
race
was
a
suspect
class,
people
who
are
not
blacks
have
received--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--strict
scrutiny
on
whether
the
use
of
race
as
a
class,
whether
they
are
white
or
a
black,
is
justified
by
a
compelling
interest.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
your
bottom
line
is,
it's
an
equal
protection
violation
for
the
federal
government,
and
all
states
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
any
argument
you
can
make
to
limit
this
to
this
case,
vis-Ã -vis
the
federal
government
and
not
the
states?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
the
--
the
discriminations
are
not
the
sexual
orientation,
but
on
a
class
of
marriage;
is
that
what
you're--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
i
pose
the
same
question
i
posed
to
the
general
to
you.
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
that
discrimination
and
--
and
the
discrimination
of
states
who
say
homosexuals
can't
get
married?
