justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
federal
court's
jurisprudence,
are
you
saying
there's
a
lack
of
adversity
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
give
us
a
pigeonhole?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me
there
--
there's
injury
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
why
does
he
enforce
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
let
me
ask
you,
suppose
that
constitutional
scholars
have
grave
doubts
about
the
practice
of
the
president
signing
a
bill
but
saying
that
he
thinks
it's,
unconstitutional
--
what
do
you
call
it,
signing
statements
or
something
like
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
adopt
your
position
that
that
would
ratify
and
confirm
and
encourage
that
questionable
practice,
because
if
the
president
thinks
the
law
is
unconstitutional
he
shouldn't
sign
it,
according
to
some
view.
and
that's
a
lot
like
what
you're
arguing
here.
it's
very
troubling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
--
that
assumes
the
premise.
we
didn't
--
the
house
didn't
know
it
was
unconstitutional.
i
mean--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
are
talking
about
ex
ante,
not
ex
post,
what
is
standing
at
the
outset?
and
the
house
says
this
is
constitutional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
to
the
argument
that
in
chadha
the
house
had
its
own
unique
institutional
responsibilities
and
prerogatives
at
stake,
either
the
one-house
veto
or
the
legislative
veto?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
would
the
senate
have
the
right
to
have
standing
to
take
the
other
side
of
this
case,
so
we
have
the
house
on
one
side
and
the
senate
on
the
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
not?
they're
concerned
about
the
argument
and
you
say
that
the
house
of
representatives
standing
alone
can
come
into
the
court.
why
can't
the
senate
standing
alone
come
into
court
and
intervene
on
the
other
side?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that
would
give
you
intellectual
whiplash.
i'm
going
to
have
to
think
about
that.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
applies
to
over
what,
1,100
federal
laws,
i
think
we
are
saying.
so
it's
not
--
it's
--
it's
--
i
think
there
is
quite
a
bit
to
your
argument
that
if
the
tax
deduction
case,
which
is
specific,
whether
or
not
if
congress
has
the
power
it
can
exercise
it
for
the
reason
that
it
wants,
that
it
likes
some
marriage
it
does
like,
i
suppose
it
can
do
that.
but
when
it
has
1,100
laws,
which
in
our
society
means
that
the
federal
government
is
intertwined
with
the
citizens'
day-to-day
life,
you
are
at
--
at
real
risk
of
running
in
conflict
with
what
has
always
been
thought
to
be
the
essence
of
the
state
police
power,
which
is
to
regulate
marriage,
divorce,
custody.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
not
really
uniformity
because
it
regulates
only
one
aspect
of
marriage.
it
doesn't
regulate
all
of
marriage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
--
i
see
an
illogic
in
your
argument.
i
--
i
hadn't
thought
of
the
relation
between
section
2
and
section
3
in
the
way
you
just
said.
you
said,
now
section
2
was
in
order
to
help
the
states.
congress
wanted
to
help
the
states.
but
then
section
3,
that
congress
doesn't
help
the
states
which
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
gay
marriage
is
lawful.
so
that's
inconsistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
helping
the
states
do
--
if
they
do
what
we
want
them
to,
which
is
--
which
is
not
consistent
with
the
historic
commitment
of
marriage
and
--
and
of
questions
of
--
of
the
rights
of
children
to
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
your
statute
applies
also
to
states
where
the
voters
have
decided
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
be
clear,
i
think
your
answer
is
fair
and
rational.
we've
switched
now
from
federal
power
to
rationality.
there
is
--
there
is
a
difference.
we're
talking
--
i
think
we
are
assuming
now
that
there
is
federal
power
and
asking
about
the
degree
of
scrutiny
that
applies
to
it.
or
are
we
going
back
to
whether
there
is
a
federal
power?
they
are
--
they
are
intertwined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
a
doma
problem.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
government,
under
our
federalism
scheme,
has
the
authority
to
regulate
marriage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
congress
can
use
its
powers
to
supercede
the
traditional
authority
and
prerogative
of
the
states
to
regulate
marriage
in
all
respects?
congress
could
have
a
uniform
definition
of
marriage
that
includes
age,
consanguinity,
etc.
,
etc?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
there
is
a
federalism
interest
at
stake
here,
and
i
thought
you
told
the
chief
justice
there
was
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
--
you
are
insisting
that
we
get
to
a
very
fundamental
question
about
equal
protection,
but
we
don't
do
that
unless
we
assume
the
law
is
valid
otherwise
to
begin
with.
and
we
are
asking
is
it
valid
otherwise.
what
is
the
federal
interest
in
enacting
this
statute
and
is
it
a
valid
federal
interest
assuming,
before
we
get
to
the
equal
protection
analysis?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
edith
windsor
and
thea
spyer
were
married
in
a
lawful
ceremony
in
ontario,
canada
in
2007.
they
returned
to
their
home
in
new
york
city.
their
same-sex
marriage
is
recognized
as
lawful
under
new
york
law.
when
spyer
died
in
2009,
she
left
her
entire
estate
to
windsor.
windsor
sought
to
claim
the
federal
estate
tax
exemption
for
surviving
spouses.
she
was
barred
from
doing
so,
however,
by
a
federal
law,
the
defense
of
marriage
act
or
doma.
section
3
of
doma
excludes
the
same-sex
partner
from
the
definition
of
spouse
as
that
term
is
used
in
federal
statutes.
section
3
does
not
expressly
forbid
states
from
permitting
same-sex
marriages
or
civil
unions
or
providing
state
benefits
to
residents
in
that
status.
but
section
3's
comprehensive
definition
of
marriage
controls
over
1,000
federal
laws
in
which
marital
status
is
addressed
including
the
estate
tax
exemption
law
of
spouses.
windsor
paid
the
estate
tax.
she
then
filed
a
suit
for
a
refund.
the
basis
for
refund
claim
is
that
section
3
of
doma,
depriving
her
of
spousal
status,
is
unconstitutional.
while
the
refund
suit
was
pending,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
notified
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
that
the
department
of
justice
would
no
longer
defend
the
constitutionality
of
section
3.
the
bipartisan
legal
advisory
group
of
the
house
of
representatives,
as
blag,
bipartisan
legal
advisory
group
voted
to
intervene
in
the
litigation
to
defend
the
law.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
ruled
that
section
3
is
unconstitutional
and
ordered
the
united
states
to
pay
windsor
a
refund.
the
first
issue
to
be
addressed
in
the
case
that
is
here
is
whether
a
justiciable
case
or
controversy
still
remains
once
the
executive
branch
decides
it
no
longer
will
defend
the
statute.
today,
the
court
concludes
that
a
controversy
does
remain
so
there
is
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
court
ruling
and
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
united
states
retains
a
stake
in
the
dispute.
the
refund
still
is
not
been
paid.
there
will
be
a
legal
injury
to
the
government
if
the
refund
is
ordered
or
legal
injury
to
the
taxpayer
if
it's
not,
that
the
executive
may
welcome
a
constitutional
ruling
invalidating
the
statute
does
not
eliminate
the
injury.
the
government
has
standing
here.
the
court
need
not
decide
whether
blag
has
independent
standing.
the
capable
defense
of
the
law
by
blag
in
this
court
does
ensure
that
there
is
and
was
a
full
argument
on
the
merits.
this
case
is
of
immediate
importance
to
the
federal
government
and
to
hundred
of
thousands
of
persons.
so
the
court's
conclusion
that
this
case
maybe
heard
on
the
merits
does
not
imply
that
no
difficulties
would
ensue
if
the
executive
were
to
decline
to
defend
statute
in
a
more
ordinary
case.
as
there
is
jurisdiction,
the
substantive
issue
of
the
validity
of
doma's
section
3
must
be
addressed.
in
recent
years,
the
limitation
of
lawful
marriage
to
heterosexual
couples,
a
limitation
which
for
centuries
had
been
deemed
both
necessary
and
fundamental,
came
to
be
seen
in
new
york
and
certain
other
states
as
an
unjust
exclusion.
these
states
have
decided
that
same-sex
couple
should
have
the
right
to
marry
and
so
live
with
pride
in
themselves
and
in
their
union,
in
a
status
of
equality
with
all
other
married
persons.
state
laws
defining
and
regulating
marriage
must
respect
the
constitutional
rights
of
persons,
but
subject
to
those
constitutional
guarantees.
regulation
of
domestic
relations
is
around
that
has
long
been
recognized
as
a
virtually
exclusive
province
of
the
states
and
the
recognition
of
civil
marriages
is
central
to
state
domestic
relations
law
applicable
to
its
residents
and
citizens.
against
this
background
of
lawful
same-sex
marriage
in
some
states,
the
design,
purpose,
and
effect
of
doma
should
be
considered
in
determining
whether
it
is
valid
under
the
constitution.
section
3
of
doma
rejects
the
long
established
preset
that
the
incidents,
benefits,
and
obligations
of
marriages
are
uniform
for
all
married
couples
within
each
state.
limited
federal
laws
that
define
the
meaning
of
marriage
in
order
to
further
federal
policy
can
be
constitutional,
but
doma
has
a
far
greater
reach.
its
operation
is
directed
to
a
class
of
persons
that
the
laws
of
12
states
have
sought
to
protect.
it
is
unnecessary,
however,
to
decide
whether
this
federal
intrusion
on
state
power
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution
because
it
disrupts
the
federal
balance.
a
different
constitutional
principle
does
control.
when
the
state
of
new
york
used
its
historic
and
essential
authority
to
define
the
marital
relation
to
include
same-sex
couples,
the
state's
role
and
the
state's
power
in
making
a
decision
enhanced
the
recognition,
dignity,
and
protection
of
the
class
of
married
same-sex
couples
in
their
own
community.
the
federal
government
uses
the
state
defined
class
for
the
opposite
purpose,
to
impose
restrictions
and
disabilities.
what
the
state
of
new
york
treats
as
alike,
the
federal
law
deems
unlike.
it
does
so
by
a
federal
law
designed
to
injure
the
same
class
the
state
seeks
to
protect.
in
doing
so,
the
federal
law
violates
basic
due
process
and
equal
protection
principles.
the
avowed
purpose
and
practical
effect
of
the
law
or
to
impose
a
disadvantage,
a
separate
status
and
so
a
stigma
upon
all
who
enter
into
same-sex
marriages
made
lawful
by
the
unquestioned
authority
of
the
states.
the
history
of
doma's
enactment
in
its
own
text
demonstrate
that
interference
with
the
equal
dignity
of
the
same-sex
marriages,
the
dignity
conferred
by
the
states
in
the
exercise
of
their
sovereign
power
was
more
than
an
incidental
effect
of
the
federal
statute,
it
was
its
essence.
the
stated
purpose
of
the
law
was
to
promote
an
interest
in
protecting
the
traditional
moral
teachings
reflected
in
heterosexual
only
marriage
laws,
where
there
any
doubt
of
this
far-reaching
purpose,
the
title
of
the
act
confirms
at
the
defense
of
marriage.
in
short,
the
act's
demonstrated
purpose
is
to
ensure
that
if
any
state
decides
to
recognize
same-sex
marriages,
those
unions
will
be
treated
as
second
class
marriages
for
purposes
of
federal
law.
by
creating
two
contradictory
marriage
regimes
within
the
same
state,
section
3
of
doma
forces
same-sex
couples
to
live
as
married
for
the
purpose
of
state
law,
but
unmarried
for
the
purpose
of
federal
law.
this
diminishes
the
stability
and
predictability
of
basic
personal
relations
the
state
has
found
it
proper
to
acknowledge
and
protect.
no
legitimate
purpose
overcomes
the
purpose
and
effect
to
disparage
and
to
injure
those
whom
the
state
by
its
marriage
laws
sought
to
protect
in
personhood
and
dignity.
by
seeking
to
displace
this
protection
and
treating
those
persons
as
living
in
marriage
as
less
respected
than
others,
section
3
of
doma
is
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
this
opinion
and
its
holding
are
confined
to
those
lawful
marriages.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice
