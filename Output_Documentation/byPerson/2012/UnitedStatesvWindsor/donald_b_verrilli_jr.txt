mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
equal
protection
analysis
in
this
case
should
focus
on
two
fundamental
points:
first,
what
does
section
3
do;
and
second,
to
whom
does
section
3
do
it?
what
section
3
does
is
exclude
from
an
array
of
federal
benefits
lawfully
married
couples.
that
means
that
the
spouse
of
a
soldier
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
cannot
receive
the
dignity
and
solace
of
an
official
notification
of
next
of
kin.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
think
that
wouldn't
raise
an
equal
protection
problem
like
this
statute
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
would
raise
a
federalism
problem.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
i
--
but
the
key
for
the
--
for
the
--
our
purposes
is
that,
in
addition
to
denying
these
fundamental
important
--
fundamentally
important
benefits,
is
who
they
are
being
denied
to.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
--
no,
we
don't,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
question
is:
what
is
the
constitutionality
for
equal
protection
purposes,
and
because
it's
unconstitutional
and
it's
embedded
into
numerous
federal
statutes,
those
statutes
will
have
an
unconstitutional
effect.
but
it's
the
equal
protection
violation
from
the
perspective
of
the
united
states
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i
think
if
congress
passed
such
a
statute,
then
we
would
have
to
consider
how
to
defend
it.
but
that's
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
with
respect
to
section
3
of
doma,
the
problem
is
an
equal
protection
problem
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it's
central
to
the
inquiry,
justice
kagan.
i
completely
agree
with
that
point.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
the
difference
is
what
section
3
does
is
impose
this
exclusion
from
federal
benefits
on
a
class
that
has
undeniably
been
subject
to
a
history
of
terrible
discrimination
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
--
i
just
want
to
clarify.
the
equal
protection
question
would
be
different
than
the
other
circumstance.
that's
a
matter
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
the
federalism
concerns
come
into
play
in
the
following
way:
in
that
mr.
clement
has
made
the
argument
that,
look,
whatever
states
can
do
in
terms
of
recognizing
marriage
or
not
recognizing
marriage,
the
federal
government
has
commensurate
authority
to
do
or
not
do.
we
don't
think
that's
right
as
a
matter
of
our
equal
protection
analysis
because
we
don't
think
the
federal
government
should
be
thought
of
as
the
51st
state.
states,
as
we
told
the
court,
yesterday
we
believe
heightened
scrutiny
ought
to
apply
even
to
the
state
decisions--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yeah.
we
think
whatever
the
outer
bounds
of
the
federal
government's
authority,
and
there
certainly
are
outer
bounds,
would
be,
apart
from
the
equal
protection
violation,
we
don't
think
that
section
3
apart
from
equal
protection
analysis
raises
a
federalism
problem.
but
we
do
think
the
federalism
analysis
does
play
into
the
equal
protection
analysis
because
the
federal
--
the
federal
government
is
not
the
51st
state
for
purposes
of
--
of
the
interests
that
mr.--
clement
has
identified
on
behalf
of
blag.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
the
question
in
the
case,
justice
alito
is
whether
congress
has
a
sufficiently
persuasive
justification
for
the
exclusion
that
it
has
imposed.
and
it
--
and
it
does
not.
the
only
way
in
which
--
that
blag's
arguments
for
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
have
any
prospect
of
being
upheld
is
if
the
court
adopts
the
minimal
rationality
standard
of
lee
optical.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
the
exclusion
that
doma
imposes
violates
equal
protection,
and
it
does
violate
equal
protection
because
you
can't
treat
this
as
though
it
were
just
a
distinction
between
optometrists
and
ophthalmologists,
as
the
lee
optical
case
did.
this
is
a
different
kind
of
a
situation
because
the
discrimination
here
is
being
visited
on
a
group
that
has
historically
been
subject
to
terrible
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
personal--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i--
said
it
would
be
subject
to
equal
protection
analysis
certainly,
and
there
might
be
a
problem.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
they
have
to
be
analyzed
under
equal
protections
principles,
but
whatever
is
true
about
the
other
situations,
in
the
situation
in
which
the
couple
is
lawfully
married
for
purposes
of
state
law
and
the
exclusion
is
a
result
of
doma
itself,
the
exclusion
has
to
be
justified
under
this
court's
equal
protection
analysis,
and
doma
won't
do
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
to
impose
the
heightened
scrutiny
equal
protection
analysis,
sure.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
that's
certainly--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
if
i
could
turn
to
the
interest
that
blag
has
actually
identified
as
supporting
this
statute,
i
think
there
are
--
there
are
--
i
think
that
you
can
see
what
the
problem
is
here.
now,
this
statute
is
not
called
the
federal
uniform
marriage
benefits
act;
it's
called
the
defense
of
marriage
act.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
statute
is
not
directed
at
uniformity
in
the
administration
of
federal
benefits.
all
--
there
is
two
equally
uniform
systems,
the
system
of
respecting
the
state
choices
and
the
system
of
--
that
blag
is
advocating
here.
and
what
blag's
got
to
do
in
order
to
satisfy
equal
protection
scrutiny
is
justify
the
choice
between
one
and
the
other,
and
the
difference
between
the
two
is
that
the
section
3
choice
is
a
choice
that
--
section
3
choice
is
a
choice
that
discriminates.
so
it's
not
simply
a
matter
sufficient
to
say,
well,
uniformity
is
enough.
section
3
discriminates.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
why
you
wouldn't
assume
that
what
congress
was
doing
when
it
enacted
a
statute,
particularly
a
statute
that
had
the
word
“
marriage
”
in
it,
was
assuming
that
the
normal
rule
that
applies
in
the
vast
majority
of
circumstances
of
deference
to
the
state
definition
of
marriage
would
be
the
operative
principle.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
but
they
may
well
have
had
in
mind
deferring
to
the
normal
state
definition
of
marriage,
whatever
it
is.
not
that
they
were
making
the
specific
choice
that
my
friend
suggested
they
were.
but
whatever
is
the
case,
when
congress
enacted
doma
that
choice
of
exclusion
has
to
be
justified
under
appropriate
equal
protection
principles.
so
the
issue
of
uniformity
just
doesn't
get
you
there,
because
there
is
no
uniformity
advantage
to
section
3
of
doma
as
opposed
to
the
traditional
rule.
the
issue
of
administration
doesn't
get
you
there.
i
mean,
at
a
very
basic
level
administrative
concerns
ought
not
be
an
important
enough
interest
to
justify
this
kind
of
a
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
but
even
if
you
look
at
them,
there
are
no
genuine
administrative
benefits
to
doma.
if
anything,
section
3
of
doma
makes
federal
administration
more
difficult,
because
now
the
federal
government
has
to
look
behind
valid
state
marriage
licenses
and
see
whether
they
are
about
state
marriages
that
are
out
of
compliance
with
doma.
it's
an
additional
administrative
burden.
so
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
administrative
--
there
is
no
administrative
advantage
to
be
gained
here
by
what
--
by
what
congress
sought
to
achieve.
and
the
fundamental
reality
of
it
is,
and
i
think
the
house
report
makes
this
glaringly
clear,
is
that
doma
was
not
enacted
for
any
purpose
of
uniformity,
administration,
caution,
pausing,
any
of
that.
it
was
enacted
to
exclude
same-sex
married,
lawfully
married
couples
from
federal
benefit
regimes
based
on
a
conclusion
that
was
driven
by
moral
disapproval.
it
is
quite
clear
in
black
and
white
in
the
pages
of
the
house
report
which
we
cite
on
page
38
of
our
brief--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
quoted
our
--
we
quoted
the
garrett
concurrence
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
wisdom
there,
that
it
may
well
not
have
been
animus
or
hostility.
it
may
well
have
been
what
garrett
described
as
the
simple
want
of
careful
reflection
or
an
instinctive
response
to
a
class
of
people
or
a
group
of
people
who
we
perceive
as
alien
or
other.
but
whatever
the
explanation,
whether
it's
animus,
whether
it's
that
--
more
subtle,
more
unthinking,
more
reflective
kind
of
discrimination,
section
3
is
discrimination.
and
i
think
it's
time
for
the
court
to
recognize
that
this
discrimination,
excluding
lawfully
married
gay
and
lesbian
couples
from
federal
benefits,
cannot
be
reconciled
with
our
fundamental
commitment
to
equal
treatment
under
law.
this
is
discrimination
in
its
most
very
basic
aspect,
and
the
house
report,
whether
--
and
i
certainly
would
not
suggest
that
it
was
universally
motivated
by
something
other
than
goodwill
--
but
the
reality
is
that
it
was
an
expression
of
moral
disapproval
of
exactly
the
kind
that
this
court
said
in
lawrence
would
not
justify
the
law
that
was
struck
down
there.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
--
we
took
the
position
we
took
yesterday
with
respect
to
marriage
--
the
analysis--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
as
we
said
yesterday,
we
think
it's
an
open
question
with
respect
to
state
recognition
of
marriage,
and
they
may
well
be
able
to
advance
interests
--
they
may
be
able
to
advance
it.
i
guess
i
shouldn't
say
“
may
well
”,
because
i
do
think
it
would
be
difficult,
as
we
said
yesterday.
they
may
be
able
to
advance
interests
that
would
satisfy
heightened
scrutiny
and
justify
non-recognition--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
--
but
here,
the
federal
government's
not
in
the
same
position
because
as
blag
concedes,
the
federal
government
at
the
most
can
act
at
the
margins
in
influencing
these
decisions
about
marriage
and
child
rearing
at
the
state
level.
and
the
second
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
both
concluded
that
there's
no
connection
at
all,
and
that's
of
course
because
section
3
doesn't
make
it
any
more
likely
that
unmarried
men
and
women
in
states
--
that
--
unmarried
men
and
women
who
confront
an
unplanned
pregnancy
are
going
to
get
married.
and
--
and
elimination
of
section
3
wouldn't
make
it
any
less
likely
that
unmarried
men
and
women
are
going
to
get
married.
it
doesn't
have
any
effect
at
all.
it
doesn't
have
any
connection
at
all.
so
it's
not
at
the
margins.
there's
no
interest
at
all
at
this
--
in
doma
in
promoting--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
our
point
here,
justice
breyer,
is
that
whatever
--
may
i
finish?
thank
you.
whatever
the
issue
is,
with
--
whatever
the
outcome
is
with
respect
to
states
and
marriage,
that
the
federal
government's
interest
in
advancing
those
justifications
through
section
3
of
doma
is
so
attenuated
that
two
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
seen
it
as
non-existent,
and
it
cannot
justify
section
3.
