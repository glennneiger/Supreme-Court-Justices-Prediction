justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
here,
why
was
there
jurisdiction
at
the
trial
level?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
government
comes
in
and
says
“
i
agree
”
--
or
if
there
was
jurisdiction,
why
did
the
court
ever
have
to
get
to
the
merits?
if
you
have
a,
let's
say,
a
lawsuit
on
an
--
on
an
indebtedness
and
the
alleged
debtor
comes
in
and
says,
yeah,
i
owe
them
money,
but
i'm
just
not
gonna
pay
it,
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
government
saying,
yeah,
it's
unconstitutional
but
i'm
going
to
enforce
it
anyway.
what
would
happen
in
that
--
in
that
indebtedness
suit
is
that
the
court
would
enter
judgment
and
say,
if
you
agree
that
you
owe
it,
by
god,
you
should
pay
it.
and
there
would
be
a
judgment
right
there
without
any
consideration
of
the
merits,
right?
why
didn't
that
happen
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
really,
that's
very
peculiar.
when
--
when
both
parties
to
the
case
agree
on
what
the
law
is?
what,
the
--
just
for
fun,
the
district
judge
is
--
is
going
to
have
a
hearing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
jurisdiction
now.
i'm
talking
about
why
the
district
court,
without
getting
to
the
merits,
should
not
have
entered
judgment
against
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
not
arisen
very
often
in
the
past,
because
in
the
past,
when
i
was
at
the
office
of
legal
counsel,
there
was
an
opinion
of
the
office
of
legal
counsel
which
says
that
the
attorney
general
will
defend
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
except
in
two
circumstances:
number
one,
where
the
basis
for
the
alleged
unconstitutionality
has
to
do
with
presidential
powers.
when
the
presidential
powers
are
involved,
he's
the
lawyer
for
the
president.
so
he
can
say,
we
think
the
statute's
unconstitutional,
i
won't
defend
it.
the
second
situation
is
where
no
possible
rational
argument
could
be
made
in
defense
of
it.
now,
neither
of
those
situations
exists
here.
and
i'm
wondering
if
we're
living
in
this
new
world
where
the
attorney
general
can
simply
decide,
yeah,
it's
unconstitutional,
but
it's
not
so
unconstitutional
that
i'm
not
willing
to
enforce
it,
if
we're
in
this
new
world,
i
--
i
don't
want
these
cases
like
this
to
come
before
this
court
all
the
time.
and
i
think
they
will
come
all
the
time
if
that's
--
if
that's
--
if
that's
the
new
regime
in
the
justice
department
that
we're
dealing
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it's
not
your
view.
it's
the
president's.
it's
only
when
the
president
thinks
it's
unconstitutional
that
you
can
decline
to
defend
it?
or
what
if
the
attorney
general
thinks
it's
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
solicitor
general,
is
that
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
it
can
be
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
solicitor
general?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
when
congress
enacts
a
statute,
it
cannot
be
defended,
it
has
no
assurance
that
that
statute
will
be
defended
in
court,
if
the
solicitor
general
in
his
view
thinks
it's
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
what
the
olc
opinion
said,
by
the
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
chadha
--
didn't
chadha
suggest
that
congress
could
have
standing
in
--
in
chadha?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
chadha,
there
was
an
argument
that
congress
had
standing,
because
what
was
at
issue
in
the
case
was
precisely
a
prerogative
of
congress
to
exercise
the
one-house
or
two-house
veto.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
that
courts
were
so
central
to
your
position.
i
--
i
thought
you
didn't
want
the
voters
in
one
state
to
dictate
to
other
states
any
more
than
you
would
want
the
courts
in
one
state
to
dictate
to
other
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
--
that's
the
same
in
the
example
that
we
just
gave
you,
that
discrimination
would
have
been
visited
on
the
same
group,
and
you
say
there
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
that's
bad
as
well,
that
all
three
of
those
has
to
be
treated
the
same,
despite
state
law
about
marriage.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
is
your
answer
yes
or
no?
is
there
a
federalism
problem
with
that,
or
isn't
there
a
federalism
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
just
--
all
these
statutes
use
the
term
“
marriage
”,
and
the
federal
government
says
in
all
these
statutes
when
it
says
marriage,
it
includes
same-sex
couples,
whether
the
state
acknowledges
them
to
be
married
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
whether
or
not
it
would
work?
i
don't
care
if
it
works.
[laughter]
does
it
--
does
it
create
a
federalism
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
doing
that,
it's
just
saying
for
purposes
--
just
what
it's
doing
here.
it
says,
for
purposes
of
all
these
federal
statutes,
when
we
say
marriage,
we
mean
--
instead
of
saying
we
mean
heterosexual
marriage,
we
mean,
whenever
we
use
it,
heterosexual
and
homosexual
marriage.
if
that's
what
it
says,
can
it
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
no.
it
includes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
--
why
are
you
so
confident
in
that
--
in
that
judgment?
how
many
--
how
many
states
permit
gay
--
gay
couples
to
marry?
justice
antonin
scalia
9.
and
--
and
so
there
has
been
this
sea
change
between
now
and
1996.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
you've
heard
i've
filed
one
of
the
dissenting
opinions.
there
are
two
parts
to
the
majority's
opinion.
the
first
explaining
why
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
question
and
the
second,
deciding
it.
both
of
them
are
in
my
view
wrong
and
the
error
in
both
springs
from
the
same
diseased
root,
an
exalted
notion
of
the
role
of
this
court
in
american
society.
in
finding
jurisdiction
to
pronounce
upon
the
constitutionality
of
doma,
the
majority
invokes
what
it
calls
this
court's
“primary
role”
in
determining
the
constitution's
meaning.
the
constitution
assigns
us
no
such
primary
role.
indeed
it
does
not
assign
us
the
role
of
determining
the
constitution's
meaning
at
all.
we
perform
that
task
accidentally
as
it
were
in
the
execution
of
what
is
our
assigned
task,
namely
just
as
the
other
two
coequal
branches
perform
the
task
of
interpreting
the
constitution
in
the
execution
of
their
assigned
roles.
our
assigned
role,
as
article
iii
says,
is
to
resolve
disputes,
cases
and
controversies
between
two
parties.
where
resolution
of
the
case
depends
on
the
constitutionality
and
hence
the
validity
of
a
particular
law,
it
becomes
and
only
then
does
it
become
as
chief
justice
marshall
wrote,
surely
the
province
of
this
court
to
say
what
the
law
is.
the
power
of
the
court
is
increased
enormously
and
becomes
indeed
primary
among
the
three
branches
when
our
ability
to
expound
upon
the
constitution
is
uncoupled
from
our
duty
to
resolve
live
controversies.
to
confirm
that
that
is
what
has
happened
here,
one
need
only
read
the
concluding
sentence
of
the
brief
for
the
government,
for
the
party
appealing
from
the
judgment
below.
that
lessons
reads,
for
the
foregoing
reasons,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed,
but
of
course
that
is
precisely
what
the
respondent,
the
supposedly
opposing
party
wants
us
to
do.
there
is
no
dispute
for
us
to
resolve.
one
could
spend
many
fruitless
afternoons
ransacking
our
library
for
any
other
petitioner's
brief
seeking
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
against
it.
the
majority
claims
that
it
is
enough
to
enable
our
jurisdiction
that
“adversarial
presentation
of
the
issues
is
assured
by
the
participation
of
amici
curiae
prepared
to
defend
with
vigor
the
other
side
of
the
issue.
that
is
truly
a
revolution
in
our
jurisprudence
and
one
as
i
have
said
that
aggrandizes
this
court.
having
gotten
jurisdiction
wrong,
the
majority
gets
the
merits
wrong
as
well
and
for
the
same
reason
of
self
aggrandizement.
as
i
described
at
length
in
my
dissent,
it
is
difficult
to
pin
down
the
precise
technical
legal
basis
for
the
majority's
conclusion
of
unconstitutionality,
but
whatever
hook
it
is
hung
on,
the
majority
opinion
makes
clear
that
what
causes
doma
to
be
unconstitutional
is
the
fact
that
it
is
motivated
by
“the
bare
desire
to
harm”
couples
in
same-sex
marriages.
the
majority
says
the
supporters
of
this
act
acted
with
malice,
with
“the
purpose,”
all
of
the
following
are
quotes,
“the
purpose
to
disparage
and
to
injury
same-sex
couples.
it
says
that
the
motivation
for
doma
was
to
demean,
to
impose
inequality,
to
impose
a
stigma,
to
deny
people
equal
dignity,
to
brand
gay
people
as
unworthy
and
to
humiliate
their
children.”
bear
in
mind
that
the
object
of
this
terrible
condemnation
is
not
some
benighted
state
legislature
and
governor,
but
are
respected
coordinate
branches
that
congress
and
the
presidency
of
the
united
states.
laying
such
a
charge
against
them
should
require
the
most
extraordinary
evidence
and
i
would
have
thought
that
every
attempt
would
be
made
to
indulge
a
more
anodyne
explanation
for
the
statute.
the
majority's
opinion
does
the
opposite,
affirmatively
concealing
from
the
reader,
never
mentioning
the
arguments
that
exist
in
its
justification.
i
imagine
that
this
is
because
it
has
harder
to
maintain
the
illusion
of
the
act's
supporters
as
unhinged
members
of
wild-eyed
lynch
mob
when
one
first
describes
their
views
as
they
see
them.
in
my
view,
a
perfectly
valid
justification
for
the
statute
is
contained
in
its
title,
the
defensive
marriage
act.
society
has
the
right,
it
has
always
had
the
right
to
define
and
defend
that
institution
and
favoring
man-woman
marriage
no
more
demeans
and
humiliates
other
sexual
relationships
than
favoring
our
constitution
demeans
and
humiliates
the
governmental
systems
of
other
countries.
but
apart
from
that
more
fundamental
point,
there
are
other
non-malevolent
justifications
that
support
this
statute.
i
will
mention
only
two.
first,
doma
avoids
difficult
choice
of
law
issues
that
will
now
arise
absent
a
uniform
federal
definition
of
marriage.
imagine
a
pair
of
women
who
marry
in
albany
and
then
moved
to
alabama,
which
does
not
recognize
as
valid
any
marriage
of
parties
of
the
same
sex.
when
the
couple
files
their
next
federal
tax
return,
maybe
a
joint
one,
which
state's
law
controls
for
federal
law
purposes,
the
state
of
celebration
which
recognizes
the
marriage
or
their
state
of
domicile
which
does
not?
are
these
questions
to
be
answered
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
or
perhaps
by
borrowing
a
state's
choice
of
law
rules?
if
so,
which
state?
and
what
about
states
where
the
status
of
an
out
of
state
same-sex
marriage
is
an
unsettled
question
under
local
law?
doma
avoided
all
this
uncertainty
specifying
which
marriages
would
be
recognized
for
federal
purposes.
second,
doma
preserves
the
intended
effects
of
prior
legislation
against
then
unforeseen
changes
in
circumstance.
when
congress
provided
for
example
that
a
special
estate
tax
exemption
would
exist
for
spouses,
this
exemption
reached
only
opposite
sex
spouses.
those
being
the
only
sort
that
were
recognized
in
any
state
at
the
time
of
doma's
passage.
when
it
became
clear
that
--
when
it
became
clear
that
changes
in
state
law
might
one
day
alter
that
balance,
doma's
definitional
section
was
enacted
to
ensure
that
state
level
experimentation
did
not
automatically
alter
the
basic
operation
of
federal
law
unless
and
until
congress
made
the
further
judgment
to
do
so
on
its
own.
congress
has
hardly
demonstrated
itself
unwilling
to
make
such
further
revising
judgments
upon
due
deliberation
consider
the
don't
ask,
don't
tell
repeal
act
of
2010.
but
in
the
majority's
judgment,
any
resistance
to
its
holding
is
beyond
the
pail
of
reasoned
disagreement.
to
question
its
invalidation
of
the
statute
is
to
act.
the
majority
is
sure
with
the
purpose
to
disparage,
injure,
degrade,
demean
and
humiliate
our
fellow
human
beings,
our
fellow
citizens
who
are
homosexual.
it
is
one
thing
for
a
society
to
elect
change.
it
is
another
for
a
court
of
law
to
impose
change
by
judging
those
who
oppose
it,
hostis
humani
generis,
enemies
of
the
human
race.
the
penultimate
sentence
of
the
majority's
opinion
is
a
naked
declaration
that,
“this
opinion
and
its
holding
are
confined
to
those
couples
joined
in
same-sex
marriages
made
lawful
by
the
state.”
in
other
words,
today's
opinion
does
not
say
anything
about
whether
same-sex
marriages
must
be
made
lawful.
it
takes
real
cheek
for
today's
majority
as
it
is
going
out
the
door
to
leave
us
with
that
comforting
assurance
when
what
has
preceeded
is
a
lengthy
lecture
on
how
superior
the
majority's
moral
judgment
in
favor
of
same-sex
marriage
is
to
the
congress'
hateful
moral
judgment
against
it.
by
formally
declaring
anyone
opposed
to
same-sex
marriage
as
an
enemy
of
human
decency,
the
majority
arms
well
every
challenger
to
a
state
law
restricting
marriage
to
its
traditional
definition.
henceforth,
those
challenges
will
lead
with
this
court's
declaration
that
there
is
“no
legitimate
purpose”
served
by
such
a
law
and
will
claim
that
the
traditional
definition
has
“the
purpose
and
effect
to
disparage
and
to
injure”
the
personhood
and
dignity
of
same-sex
couples.
the
result
will
be
a
judicial
distortion
of
our
society's
debate
over
marriage.
that
debate
is
in
no
need
of
this
court's
clumsy
help.
few
public
controversies
touch
an
institution
so
central
to
the
lives
of
many
and
few
inspire
such
attended
passion
by
good
people
on
all
sides.
few
public
controversies
will
ever
demonstrate
so
vividly
the
beauty
of
what
our
framers
gave
us,
a
gift
the
court
pawns
today
to
buy
its
stolen
moment
in
the
spotlight,
a
system
of
government
that
permits
us
to
rule
ourselves.
since
doma's
passage,
citizens
on
both
sides
of
the
question
have
seen
victories
and
they
have
seen
defeats.
there
have
been
plebiscites,
legislation,
persuasion
and
loud
voices,
in
other
words,
democracy.
victories
in
some
states,
for
example,
north
carolina
for
the
traditional
definition
of
marriage
have
been
offset
by
victories
in
other
states,
for
example,
maryland
for
same-sex
marriage.
even
in
a
single
state
such
as
maine,
the
question
has
come
out
differently
on
different
occasions.
in
the
majority's
telling,
however,
this
story
is
black
and
white,
hate
your
neighbor
or
come
along
with
us.
the
truth
is
more
complicated.
it
is
hard
to
admit
that
one's
political
opponents
are
not
monsters
especially
in
a
struggle
like
this
one.
and
the
challenge
in
the
end
proves
more
than
today's
court
can
handle,
too
bad.
a
reminder
that
disagreement
over
something
so
fundamental
as
marriage
can
still
be
settled
democratically
rather
than
by
judicial
fiat
would
have
been
a
fit
task
for
what
an
earlier
times
was
called
a
judicial
temperament.
we
might
have
covered
ourselves
with
honor
today
by
promising
all
sides
of
this
debate
that
it
was
theirs
to
settle
and
that
we
would
respect
their
resolution.
we
might
have
let
the
people
decide,
but
that
the
majority
will
not
do.
some
will
rejoice
in
today's
decision
and
some
will
despair
at
it.
that
is
the
nature
of
a
controversy
that
matters
so
much
to
so
many,
but
the
court
has
cheated
both
sides,
robbing
the
winners
of
an
honest
