justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
solicitor
general's
standing
argument
is
very
abstract.
but
here
is
one
possible
way
of
understanding
it,
perhaps
the
solicitor
general
will
disavow
it,
but
it
would
go
like
this:
the
president's
position
in
this
case
is
that
he
is
going
to
continue
to
enforce
doma,
engage
in
conduct
that
he
believes
is
unconstitutional,
until
this
court
tells
him
to
stop.
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
told
the
executive
branch
to
comply
with
the
equal
protection
clause
immediately.
the
president
disagrees
with
the
temporal
aspect
of
that,
so
the
executive
is
aggrieved
in
the
sense
that
the
executive
is
ordered
to
do
something
prior
to
the
point
when
the
executive
believes
it
should
do
that
thing.
now,
wouldn't
that
be
sufficient
to
make
--
to
create
injury
in
the
executive
and
render
the
executive
an
aggrieved
party?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
are
you
aggrieved?
“
aggrieved
”
means
that
you
are
deprived
of
your
legal
rights.
and
you
don't
think
that
you've
been
deprived
of
your
legal
rights
because
your
rights
--
your
obligations
under
the
constitution
supercede
doma,
and
you
haven't
been
deprived
of
anything
that
you're
entitled
to
under
the
constitution.
so
how
are
you
aggrieved?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
just
--
before
you
go
on
to
the
house
group,
could
i
just
clear
up
something?
in
your
brief,
you
argue
that
you
are
representing
all
three
branches
of
the
government,
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
--
you're
representing
the
judiciary
as
you
stand
before
us
here
today--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--trying
to
persuade
the
court,
you're
representing
the
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
seems
very
strange.
so
in
--
in
a
criminal
case
where
it's
the
united
states
v.--
smith,
appearing
before
an
article
iii
judge,
the
united
states,
the
prosecutor
is
representing
the
court
as
well?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
why
is--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--then
why
is
it
sufficient
for
one
house
to
take
the
position
that
the
statute
is
constitutional?
the
enactment
of
legislation
requires
both
houses,
and
usually
the
signature
of
the
president.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
the
law
is
passed
by
a
bare
majority
of
one
of
the
houses,
then
each
member
of
that
--
of
that
house
who
was
part
of
the
majority
has
the
same
interest
in
defending
its
constitutionality.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
i
ask
you
this
question:
on
the
question
of
the
house
resolution--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--if
--
if
a
house
--
if
one
of
the
houses
passes
a
resolution
saying
that
a
particular
group
was
always
authorized
to
represent
us,
do
you
think
it's
consistent
with
the
separation
of
powers
for
us
to
examine
whether
that's
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
that
house
of
congress?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
we
look
just
at
the
estate
tax
provision
that's
at
issue
in
this
case,
which
provides
specially
favorable
treatment
to
a
married
couple
as
opposed
to
any
other
individual
or
economic
unit.
what
was
the
purpose
of
that?
was
the
purpose
of
that
really
to
foster
traditional
marriage,
or
was
congress
just
looking
for
a
convenient
category
to
capture
households
that
function
as
a
unified
economic
unit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
congress
could
have
achieved
exactly
what
it
achieved
under
section
3
by
excising
the
term
“
married
”
from
the
united
states
code
and
replacing
it
with
something
more
neutral.
it
could
have
said
“
certified
domestic
units
”,
and
then
defined
this
in
exactly
the
way
that
section
3
--
exactly
the
way
doma
defines
“
marriage
”.
would
that
make
a
difference?
in
that
instance,
the
federal
government
wouldn't
be
purporting
to
say
who
is
married
and
who
is
not
married;
it
would
be
saying
who
is
entitled
to
various
federal
benefits
and
burdens
based
on
a
federal
definition.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
take
you
back
to
the
example
that
you
began
with,
where
a
member
of
the
military
is
injured.
so
let's
say
three
soldiers
are
injured
and
they
are
all
in
same-sex
relationships,
and
in
each
instance
the
other
partner
in
this
relationship
wants
to
visit
the
soldier
in
a
hospital.
first
is
a
spouse
in
a
state
that
allows
same-sex
marriage,
the
second
is
a
domestic
partner
in
a
state
that
an
allows
that
but
not
same-sex
marriage,
the
third
is
in
an
equally
committed
loving
relationship
in
a
state
that
doesn't
involve
either.
now,
your
argument
is
that
under
federal
law
the
first
would
be
admitted,
should
be
admitted,
but
the
other
two
would
be
kept
out?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
example.
your
--
your
position
seems
to
me,
yes,
one
gets
in,
two
stay
out,
even
though
your
legal
arguments
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
they
all
should
be
treated
the
same.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
get
to
the
question
i
asked
mr.
clement.
it
just
gets
rid
of
the
word
“
marriage
”,
takes
it
out
of
the
u.s.
code
completely.
substitutes
something
else,
and
defines
it
as
same-sex
--
to
include
same-sex
couples.
surely
it
could
do
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it's
just
the
word
“
marriage
”?
and
it's
just
the
fact
that
they
use
this
term
“
marriage
”?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
if
the
estate
tax
follows
state
law,
would
not
that
create
an
equal
protection
problem
similar
to
the
one
that
exists
here?
suppose
there
were
a
dispute
about
the
--
the
state
of
residence
of
your
client
and
her
partner
or
spouse.
was
it
new
york,
was
it
some
other
state
where
same-sex
marriage
would
not
have
been
recognized?
and
suppose
there
was
--
the
state
court
said
the
state
of
residence
is
a
state
where
it's
not
recognized.
would
--
would
you
not
have
essentially
the
same
equal
protection
argument
there
that
you
have
now?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
just
--
if
i
could
follow
up
with
one
--
one
question.
what
if
the
--
the
hypothetical
surviving
spouse,
partner
in
north
carolina,
brought
an
equal
protection
argument,
saying
that
there
is
no
--
it
is
unconstitutional
to
treat
me
differently
because
i
am
a
resident
of
north
carolina
rather
than
a
resident
of
new
york.
what
would
be
--
would
that
be
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sexual
orientation?
what
would
be
the
level
of
scrutiny?
would
it
survive?
