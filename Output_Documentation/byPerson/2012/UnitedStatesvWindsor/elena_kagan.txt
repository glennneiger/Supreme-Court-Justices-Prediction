but,
ms.
jackson,
i
mean,
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
we
have
injury
here
in
the
most
classic,
most
concrete
sense.
there's
$300,000
that's
going
to
come
out
of
the
government's
treasury
if
this
decision
is
upheld,
and
it
won't
if
it
isn't.
now,
the
government
is
willing
to
pay
that
$300,000,
would
be
happy
to
pay
that
$300,000,
but
whether
the
government
is
happy
or
sad
to
pay
that
$300,000,
the
government
is
still
paying
the
$300,000,
which
in
the
usual
set
of
circumstances
is
the
classic
article
iii
injury.
why
isn't
it
here?
justice
elena
kagan
but
don't
we
often
separate
those
two
things,
ask
whether
there's
injury
for
article
iii
purposes
and
causation
and
redressability,
as
you
say,
but
then
say,
well,
sometimes
when
all
of
those
are
met,
there's
not
going
to
be
adequate
presentation
of
the
arguments,
and
so
we
will
appoint
an
amicus
or
we'll
restructure
things?
and
we
do
that
when
the
government
confesses
error,
often.
i
mean,
we
do
that
several
times
a
year
in
this
courtroom.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
srinivasan,
chadha
says
what
you
said
it
said
about
what
it
means
to
be
aggrieved--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
chadha
also
left
open
the
article
iii
question.
why
did
chadha
leave
it
open
if
it's
the
same
thing?
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
a
couple
of
cases
sort
of
in
the
middle
of
the
chief
justice's
and
this
one?
so
let's
say
that
the
attorney
general
decides
that
a
particular
application
of
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
decides
to
give
up
on
that
application.
or
even
let's
say
the
attorney
general
decides
that
the
application
of
the
statute
might
be
unconstitutional,
so
decides
to
interpret
the
statute
narrowly
in
order
to
avoid
that
application.
could
congress
then
come
in?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
clement,
for
the
most
part
and
historically,
the
only
uniformity
that
the
federal
government
has
pursued
is
that
it's
uniformly
recognized
the
marriages
that
are
recognized
by
the
state.
so,
this
was
a
real
difference
in
the
uniformity
that
the
federal
government
was
pursuing.
and
it
suggests
that
maybe
something
--
maybe
congress
had
something
different
in
mind
than
uniformity.
so
we
have
a
whole
series
of
cases
which
suggest
the
following:
which
suggest
that
when
congress
targets
a
group
that
is
not
everybody's
favorite
group
in
the
world,
that
we
look
at
those
cases
with
some
--
even
if
they're
not
suspect
--
with
some
rigor
to
say,
do
we
really
think
that
congress
was
doing
this
for
uniformity
reasons,
or
do
we
think
that
congress's
judgment
was
infected
by
dislike,
by
fear,
by
animus,
and
so
forth?
i
guess
the
question
that
this
statute
raises,
this
statute
that
does
something
that's
really
never
been
done
before,
is
whether
that
sends
up
a
pretty
good
red
flag
that
that's
what
was
going
on.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
is
what
happened
in
1996
--
and
i'm
going
to
quote
from
the
house
report
here
--
is
that
"congress
decided
to
reflect
an
honor
of
collective
moral
judgment
and
to
express
moral
disapproval
of
homosexuality.
"
is
that
what
happened
in
1996?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but,
general,
surely
the
question
of
what
the
federal
interests
are
and
whether
those
federal
interests
should
take
account
of
the
historic
state
prerogatives
in
this
area
is
relevant
to
the
equal
protection
inquiry?
