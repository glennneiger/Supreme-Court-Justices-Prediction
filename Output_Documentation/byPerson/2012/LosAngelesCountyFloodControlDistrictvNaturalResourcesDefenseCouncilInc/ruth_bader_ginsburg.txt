justice
ruth

this
case
involves
the
meaning
of
“discharge
of
a
pollutant”
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
clean
water
act.
petitioner
los
angeles
county
flood
control
district
operates
a
municipal
separate
storm
sewer
system
or
ms4.
an
ms4
is
a
drainage
system
that
collects,
transports,
and
discharges
stormwater.
stormwater
is
often
heavily
polluted.
the
clean
water
act
and
its
implementing
regulations
therefore
require
ms
operators
like
the
los
angeles
district
to
obtain
a
permit
before
discharging
stormwater
into
navigable
waterways.
respondents,
two
environmental
advocacy
groups,
filed
a
citizen
suit
against
the
district
under
the
clean
water
act.
their
complaint
alleged
that
water
quality
measurements
from
monitoring
stations
in
the
los
angeles
and
san
gabriel
rivers
showed
that
the
district
was
not
operating
in
accord
with
its
permit.
the
us
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
district
on
those
claims,
but
the
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
monitoring
stations
for
the
los
angeles
and
san
gabriel
rivers,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
are
located
in
concrete
channels
controlled
by
the
district
and
constructed
for
flood-control
purposes.
stemming
from
this
impression,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
district
had
discharged
pollutants
in
violation
of
the
clean
water
act.
the
discharged
occurred,
the
ninth
circuit
concluded,
when
polluted
water
detected
at
the
monitoring
stations
flowed
out
of
the
concrete
channels
and
into
downstream
portions
of
the
waterways
lacking
concrete
linings.
we
had
a
certiorari
to
decide
the
following
question.
does
the
flow
of
water
from
an
improved
portion
of
a
navigable
waterway
into
an
unimproved
portion
of
the
same
waterway
qualify
under
the
clean
water
act
as
a
discharge
of
pollutants?
the
parties
in
the
united
states,
as
amicus
curiae,
agree
and
the
opinion
released
today
holds
that
the
answer
to
this
question
is
no
and
that
means
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
reversed.
our
holding
follows
ineluctably
from
our
decision
in
south
florida
water
management
district
v.
miccosukee
tribe.
we
held
then
miccosukee
that
the
transfer
of
water
between
a
canal
and
in
a
nearby
reservoir
would
count
as
a
discharge
of
pollutants
under
the
clean
water
act
only
if
the
canal
and
the
reservoir
were
meaningfully
distinct
water
bodies.
homing
in
on
the
terms
of
the
district's
permit,
respondents
alternatively
argue
that
the
exceedances
detected
at
the
monitoring
stations
sufficed
to
establish
the
district's
liability
for
its
upstream
discharges.
this
argument
was
made
and
failed
in
the
ninth
circuit
because
it
is
not
embraced
within
the
narrow
question
on
which
we
read
its
certiorari.
we
do
not
address
it.
our
decision
reversing
the
ninth
circuit's
judgment
and
remanding
is
joined
by
eight
members
of
the
court,
justice
alito
concurs
in
the
judgment
only.
