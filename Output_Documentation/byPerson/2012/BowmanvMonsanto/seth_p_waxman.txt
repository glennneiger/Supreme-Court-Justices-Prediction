mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
by
answering
a
couple
of,
i
guess,
science
or
technology
questions
that
came
up
before
launching
into
our
doctrinal
position.
first
of
all,
justice
kennedy,
soybeans
are
soybeans.
they
are
harvested
at
a
particular
point
in
time,
whatever
use
is
going
to
be
made
for
them.
it
is
not
a
plant
like
a
flower,
geranium
for
example,
which
has
to
be
left
to
go
to
seed,
or
alfalfa.
the
bean
is
the
seed.
all
soybeans
have
to
be
processed
to
be
used
in
any
way.
if
they
are
going
to
be
planted,
they
have
to
be
cleaned
before
they
are
put
in
the
ground
at
the
right
time.
if
they
are
being
fed
to
either
humans
or
animals,
they
have
to
be
processed
in
a
way
that
eliminates
an
enzyme
that
makes
them
indigestible
by
animals.
justice
scalia,
your
question
about
well,
farmers
now
just
can't
do
second
plantings
because
soybeans
are
put
in
huge
grain
elevators
and
different
varieties
are
mingled,
that
is
true
in
the
sense
that
if
one
or
more
of
those
soybeans
were
protected
by
a
patent,
the
actual
growing
of
the
use
of
those
patented
inventions
without
a
license
would
be
infringement,
although,
of
course,
if
no
glyphosate
were
put
on
top
of
it,
neither
the
farmer
nor
monsanto
would
ever
know
that
there
was
an
act
of
infringement.
but
more
to
the
point,
farmers
--
i
mean,
the
planting
of
second
crops,
that
is
crop
rotation
of
interspersing
soybeans
and
winter
wheat,
is
very,
very
common.
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
soybean
farmers
who
do
this
every
year.
mr.
bowman
has
acknowledged
that
so
far
as
he
knows,
he's
the
only
one
who's
doing
it
this
way.
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
ways
in
which
he
could
obtain
a
much
less
expensive
crop
of
--
you
know,
a
particular
variety
of
soybean,
so
one
that
will
all
grow
to
the
same
height
and
germinate
at
the
same
time.
and
in
fact,
he
explained
this
to
the
district
court
in
his
response
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
at
page
152a
of
the
joint
appendix.
he
said
defendant
wanted
a
cheap
source
of
seed
for
his
second
crop
beans
because
of
the
normal
risks
in
growing
“
wheat
beans
”;
that
is,
the
second
crop
that
follows
the
harvesting
of
winter
wheat.
quote,
"defendant
simply
wasn't
going
to
plant
the
high
priced
soybean
seed
after
his
wheat
crop.
"
and
here's
the
relevant
sentence.
"defendant
could
have
purchased
conventional
seed,
that
is,
non-patented
seed,
and
then
saved
its
offspring
for
wheat
beans.
"
in
other
words,
he
could
have
gone
and
bought
a
non-patented
--
a
bag
of
non-patented
seed
for
much
less
money,
and
used
it
as
his
second
crop,
or
harvested
a
portion
of
it
--
and
soybeans
replicate
at
a
rate
between
20
and
80
times
in
each
generation
--
and
have
a
perpetual
source
for
his
second
crop
thereafter.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
exactly.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
the
glyphosate
resistance
doesn't
change
the
yield
of
a
particular
plant,
it
changes
the
way
you
have
to
control
weeds.
and
he
would
not
be
able
to
use
monsanto's
technology
that
would
allow
aerial
application
of
an
herbicide.
he
would
have
to
--
if
he
wanted
to
buy
plain
old,
you
know,
conventional
soybeans,
he
has
to
control
for
weeds
in
the
conventional
way.
and
here's
the
very
next
sentence
in
his
response
to
the
court.
“
defendant
”
--
that
is,
instead
of
purchasing
conventional
seeds
and
saving
them,
he
says
"defendant
decided
to
purchase
a
grain
dealer's
commodity
grain
because
he
felt
there
was
a
good
chance
he
would
obtain
mostly
grain
that
would
be
resistant
to
glyphosate.
"
and
therefore,
he
could
use
monsanto's
technology
without
having
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
question
about
this
is
a
new
case
and
--
let
me
go
first
to
your
first
question
in
the
case,
which
is
why
would
a
company
ever
want
to
do
this?
i
think
the
answer
is
that
without
the
ability
--
let's
talk
about
soybeans
and
then
broaden
it
to
other
kinds
of
readily
replicable
technologies
--
without
the
ability
to
limit
reproduction
of
soybeans
containing
this
patented
trait,
monsanto
could
not
have
commercialized
its
invention,
and
never
would
have
produced
what
is,
by
now,
the
most
popular
agricultural
technology
in
america,
because
as
ms.
sherry
was
pointing
out,
the
sale
of
the
very
first
roundup
ready
soybean
seed,
from
which
all
the
trillions
of
roundup
ready
soybean
seeds
in
existence
now
derive,
would
have
under,
mr.
bowman's
theory,
fully
exhausted
not
only
monsanto's
rights
in
that
seed
that
was
sold,
but
in
all
progeny
unto
the
--
however
many
generations
justice
breyer
thinks
is
“
not
too
many
”.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
how
this
technology
works.
the
department
of
agriculture
licensed
monsanto
to
engage
in
a
transformation
event;
that
is,
to
introduce
its
recombinant
gene
into
soybean
germ
plasma.
it's
illegal
to
do
it
unless
you
get
a
government
license
to
do
it.
and
you
can
do
it
once.
and
that
is
done
by
the
technology
company,
use
--
taking
something
what's
called
a
gene
gun
and
using
the
gene
gun
to
inject
recombinant
dna
into
regular
germ
plasma.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
--
the
department
of
agriculture
authorized
monsanto
to
engage
in
--
to
transform
natural
--
natural
plant
material
with
its
recombinant
gene
in
one
single
event
that
is
referred
to
as
a
transformation.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
you
may
be
able
to
shoot
several
--
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
shoot
a
whole
round
or
whatever.
but
in
any
event,
it's
one
event.
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i,
in
my
mind,
have
been
trying
to
figure
out
what
a
gene
gun
looks
like.
and
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
if
you
could
use
it
to
rob
a
bank.
but
the
point
is
--
and
the
--
the
federal
register
site
for
the
transformation
event
with
respect
to
roundup
ready
is
--
is
provided
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief.
what
happens
then
is
that
monsanto
uses
those
transformed
cells
to
grow
a
soybean
plant.
and
that
soybean
plant
produces
genetic
--
produces
seeds
or
soybeans
that
have
the
recombinant
roundup
ready
technology
in
it.
monsanto
then
provides
--
in
almost
all
of
the
cases,
monsanto
engages
in
licensed
sales
of
those
transformed
seeds
to
hundreds
of
different
seed
companies
that
produce
different
varieties,
and
they
make
both
conventional
seed
with
a
particular
varietal
makeup
and
a
roundup
ready
version
of
that
variety.
monsanto
provides
the
soybeans
that
it
has
transformed
to
the
seed
companies,
to
the
hundreds
of
seed
companies
for
consideration.
under
mr.
bowman's
theory,
that
was
it
for
all
of
monsanto's
rights
with
respect
to
this
technology.
the
very
first
time
it
took
an
original
transformed
seed
and
sold
it
to
a
seed
company
so
that
it
could
bulk
up
and
cross-breed
and
produce
different
varieties,
monsanto
had
lost
all
of
its
patent
rights.
in
other
words,
by
go
at
--
having
committed
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
13
years
to
develop
this
technology
in
the
very
first
sale
of
an
article
that
practices
the
patent,
it
would
have
exhausted
its
rights
in
perpetuity.
now,
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--certainly
not.
let
me
make
--
let
me
make
three
points,
starting
with
the
edamame
and
moving
up
to
inadvertent
infringers.
edamame
is
an
immature
form
of
the
soybean
seed.
you
can
plant
edamame--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i
take
my
--
you
know,
my
girl
scout
troop
and
have
them
do
a
science
experiment,
it
will
rot
but
it
will
not
generate.
and
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
also
reminds
me
that
my
original
answer
to
justice
kennedy
is
wrong,
which
is
that
edamame
is
taken
from
the
pods
before
the
--
the
thing
becomes
actually
a
seed
that
can
be
processed
in
any
other
way.
your
point
about
the
ubiquity
of
roundup
ready's
use
is
a
fair
one.
i
mean,
this
is
probably
the
most
rapidly
adopted
technological
advance
in
history.
the
very
first
roundup
ready
soybean
seed
was
only
made
in
1996.
and
it
now
is
grown
by
more
than
90
percent
of
the
275,000
soybean
farms
in
the
united
states.
but
size
--
that
is,
success
--
has
never
been
thought
and
can't
be
thought
to
affect
the
contour
of
patent
rights.
you
may
very
--
with
soybeans,
the
problem
of
blowing
seed
is
not
an
issue
for
soybeans.
soybeans
don't
--
i
mean,
it
would
take
hurricane
sandy
to
blow
a
soybean
into
some
other
farmer's
field.
and
soybeans,
in
any
event,
are
--
you
know,
have
perfect
flowers;
that
is,
they
contain
both
the
pollen
and
the
stamen,
so
that
they
--
which
is
the
reason
that
they
breed
free
and
true,
unlike,
for
example,
corn.
the
point
that
there
may
be
many
farmers
with
respect
to
other
crops
like
alfalfa
that
may
have
some
inadvertent
roundup
ready
alfalfa
in
their
fields
may
be
true,
although
it's
--
it
is
not
well
documented.
there
would
be
inadvertent
infringement
if
the
farmer
was
cultivating
a
patented
crop,
but
there
would
be
no
enforcement
of
that.
the
farmer
wouldn't
know,
monsanto
wouldn't
know,
and
in
any
event,
the
damages
would
be
zero
because
you
would
ask
what
the
reasonable
royalty
would
be,
and
if
the
farmer
doesn't
want
roundup
ready
technology
and
isn't
using
roundup
ready
technology
to
save
costs
and
increase
productivity,
the
--
the
royalty
value
would
be
zero.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mm-hmm.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--so
infringement
is
--
unlike
contributory
infringement
or
induced
infringement,
the
act
of
infringement,
that
is
a
violation
of
section
271--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--is
a
strict
liability
tort,
but
it
requires
affirmative
volitional
contact
--
conduct.
that
is,
it's
not
that
--
a
thing
doesn't
infringe;
a
person
infringes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
person--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
mean,
take
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--sure.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
of
course.
i
mean,
take
the
example,
and
this
goes
to
i
think
the
comment
made
by
the
chief
justice,
that
even
in
the
software
context,
we
haven't
had
this
case
yet.
you
did
have
this
case
in
--
in
microsoft
v.
at&t
that
involved,
you
know,
microsoft's
golden
disk
that
has
the
windows
operating
system
on
it,
which
is
patented,
and
was
being
exported
overseas
for
introduction
into,
you
know,
computers
that
were
manufactured
overseas.
and
at&t's
patent,
which
was
a
method
of
compressing
speech,
was
practiced
by
the
windows
software.
and
this
court
held
that,
although
the
writing
of
the
windows
operating
system
into
computers
in
the
united
states
would
have
infringed
the
patent,
and
when
microsoft
did
that
it
did
infringe
at&t's
patent,
the
fact
that
the
copies
were
made
onto
the
hard
drives
of
the
computer
overseas
meant
that
the
act
of
infringement
occurred
overseas
and
there
was
not
an
export
of
--
of
an
infringing
product
for
the
purposes
of
infringing
overseas
for
purposes
of
section
271(f).
so
i
think
you
have
decided
in
the
context
of
software,
which
of
course
replicates
even
more
readily
than
soybeans
do
or
vaccines
or
cell
lines
or
plasmids,
that
the
copies
that
are
actually
made
when
a
--
a
software
is
written
onto
the
hard
drive
of
a
computer
is
a
different
thing
than
the
disk
that
was
sent
and
is
infringing
if
it
occurs
within
the
united
states.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
so
the
other
one--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
let
me
--
let
me
answer
your
question
this
way:
first
of
all,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
need
whatsoever
for
this
court
--
we
agree
with
the
government
that
there's
no
need
for
the
court
to
address
the
question
of
conditional
sales
and
the
extent
to
which
patent
law
recognizes
under
some
circumstances
conditional
sales,
because
in
this
case
the
federal
circuit
did
not
address
that
ground
which
we
advocated
and
we
still
advocate,
but
instead
said
--
and
i'm
reading
from
14a
of
the
petition
appendix.
"even
if
monsanto's
patent
rights
in
the
commodity
seeds
are
exhausted,
such
a
conclusion
would
be
of
no
consequence,
because
once
a
grower
like
bowman
plants
the
commodity
seeds
containing
monsanto's
roundup
ready
technology
and
the
next
generation
of
seed
develops,
the
grower
has
created
a
newly
infringing
article.
"
in
other
words,
what
the
federal
circuit
decided,
and
it
is
entirely
correct
and
it
should
be
affirmed
on
that
basis,
is
what
you're
calling
i
think
generation
3,
let's
say
that
for
simplicity's
sake,
since
generation
1
is
the
original
soybean
sold
by
monsanto
to
seed
companies,
let's
just
say
that
the
bags
of
soybean
seeds
that
farmers
go
to
purchase
from
seed
dealers
is
called
generation
n
and
they
are
licensed
to
produce
generation
n
plus
1.
but
then,
what
about
n
plus
2?
so
what
the
federal
circuit
held
is
n
plus
2
has
never
been
sold.
it
was
created,
it
exists
without
a
sale,
and
because
a
sale
is
the
sine
qua
non
of
patent
exhaustion,
which
is
also
referred
to
as
first
sale,
there
is
no
exhaustion.
alternatively,
the
federal
circuit
said
in
any
event,
even
when
exhaustion
applies,
it
only
privileges
the
using
or
selling
of
the
article
sold;
as
your
honor's
questions
pointed
out
originally,
it
never
privileges
the
making
of
a
new
infringing
product.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
you're
referring
to
generation
n
plus
2,
the
answer
is
yes,
because
those
are
newly
infringing
products
with
no
exhaustion
of
monsanto's
rights,
and
as
a
consequence
farmers
have
no
authority
to
use,
make,
sell,
or
offer
to
sell
without
monsanto's
authorization.
that
is
a
--
just
a
straightforward
application
of
section
271.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
--
i
agree
that
you
don't
need
to
reach
the
prong
and
you
shouldn't.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
that
--
i
think
that
an
appropriate
case
will
come
up
where
it
will
be
important
for
you
to
determine
that.
and
our
third
argument,
which
wasn't
addressed
by
the
federal
circuit
and
isn't
necessary
to
affirm,
is
that
conditional
sales
are
not
ipso
facto
unenforceable;
that
is,
a
--
in
an
instant
--
everybody
understands
that
if
instead
of
selling
technology,
you
lease
it,
and
you
sign
a
license
that
imposes
conditions
on
that
lease,
you
know,
unless
they
are
unreasonable,
conditions
that
are
reasonably
related
to
exploitation
of
the
invention
are
enforceable.
mr.
bowman
acknowledges
that.
everyone
acknowledges
that.
our
single
submission
here
is
that
where
you
have
a
technology
that
cannot
be
leased
because
it
will
consume
itself
in
whatever
use
one
makes
of
it,
and
therefore
has
to
be
--
an
article
embodying
the
invention
has
to
be
sold
and
where
the
invention
cannot
be
commercialized
if
it
--
if
the
inventor
has
to
realize
its
full
costs
of
development
and
a
reasonable
rate
of
return
on
the
first
sale,
the
fact
that
there
is
this
necessary
sale
in
order
to
commercialize
the
invention
cannot
ipso
facto
make
all
such
conditions
unenforceable.
and
that's
all
--
if
you
were
to
reach
the
conditional
sale
issue
in
this
case,
that
is
all
we
think
this
case
stands
for.
and
the
reason
i
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes,
and
i
think
the
reason,
if
we
take
it
out
of
the
soybean
area,
let's
look
at
vaccines.
because
the
roundup
ready
gene
essentially
immunizes
soybean
plants
from
the
herbicide
in
the
same
way
that
a
life-saving
vaccine
will
immunize
individuals
that
receive
it
from
some
external
--
it
wouldn't
be
a
herbicide
--
a
life
threat.
okay.
vaccines
are
live.
they
are
live
cultures;
they
can
regenerate
themselves.
if
a
company
develops
the
vaccine
for,
you
know,
h1
--
i
shouldn't
be
using
--
an
important
life-saving
vaccine--
[laughter]
--it's
unsupportable
to
say
that
you
cannot
sell
a
quantity
of
that
vaccine
without
exhausting
all
of
your
rights
in
it.
i
mean,
when
schering-plough
or
bristol-myers
develops
a
vaccine
and
sells
some
of
it
to
cvs
so
i
can
go
in
and
get
injected,
they
haven't
lost
all
of
their
patent
rights
in
that
vaccine.
cvs
can't
turn
around
and
become
a
competitor.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
and
keep
--
well,
keep
replicating
it
in
competition.
take
another
example--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
cvs
was
presumably
buying
it
either
from
the
manufacturer
or
another
lab.
but
the
point
here
is,
to
take
the
software
example,
if
i
go
to,
you
know,
staples
and
buy
the
windows
operating
system
on
a
disk,
i
don't
have
the
authority
to
put
it
in
a
disk
replicator
and
press
a
button
and
make
a
million
copies
of
it.
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yeah.
well,
let
me
--
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
is,
of
course,
poor
dr.
chakrabarty
who,
you
know,
invented
a
new
man-made
bacteria.
bacteria
replicate
themselves,
unlike
soybeans
which
require
human
intervention.
i
mean,
the
notion--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
mean,
my
submission
about--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
here's
one.
i
will
use
something
that
doesn't
make
itself,
because
we
think
that
is
covered
by
the
new
article.
let's
say
that
i
invent
a
new,
miraculous
new
machine.
i
get
a
patent
for
it.
i
want
people
to
be
able
--
i'm
going
to
commercialize
it
or
i'm
going
to
license
with
people
to
commercialize
it,
but
i
want
people
to
be
able
to
study
it
and
research
it.
and
so,
like
monsanto
with
its
seeds,
i
sign
--
i
provide
a
copy
of
the
machine
to
mit
with
a
research-only
license;
that
is,
you
can
use
this
machine
to
figure
out
how
it
works
and
develop
new
applications
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff.
if
that
sale
is
exhausting
for
all
purposes,
i
can't
prevent
mit
or
a
third
party
that
mit
provides
the
machine
for--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
go
into
competition
with
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
but
you
can't
lease
articles
like
software
and,
you
know,
soybeans
that
consume
themselves
in
any
use
other
than
an
art
experiment.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
mean,
when
you
say
you
can't
sell
them.
so,
as
ms.
sherry
was
pointing
out--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
would
be
true
even
if
this
case
came
out
another
way,
justice
kennedy.
first
of
all
because
grain
elevators
are
prohibited
by
state
and
federal
law
from
selling
seed,
period.
they
sell
--
they
buy
grain
and
they
sell
grain.
they
can't
sell
seed.
number
2,
almost
all
varieties
of
soybeans
or
other
crop
plants
are
currently
protected
by
the
--
under
the
patent
--
the
plant
variety
protection
act.
as
this
court
and
congress
recognized,
the
requisites
for
getting
a
certificate
are
--
i
mean,
it's
like
a
registration
requirement.
and
we
know
from
j.e.m.
and
the
relevant
provision
of
the
pvpa
that
it
is
unlawful
to
divert
crops
that
are
protected
by
a
pvpa
certificate
for
reproductive
uses.
so
irrespective
of
all
of
this,
whatever
happens,
even
if
there
is
only
1
percent
of
patented
soybeans
in
a
grain
elevator,
the
grain
elevator
can't
sell
it
as
seed
both
under
the
federal
and
state
seed
laws
and
under
the
patent
variety
protection
act.
that's
why
the
solution
for
farmers
like
monsanto
--
like
mr.
bowman
is
to
simply
buy
conventional
seed,
multiply
it,
you
know,
20,
30,
40,
50,
80
times
in
a
single
generation
and
save
1/80th
of
it
to
replant
in
his
second
crop,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
buy
roundup
ready
technology
for
his
second
crop
and
use
the
glyphosate
aerially.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
we
will
submit.
