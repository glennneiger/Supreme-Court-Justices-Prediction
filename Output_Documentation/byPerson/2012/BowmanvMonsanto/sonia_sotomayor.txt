i'm
sorry.
the
exhaustion
doctrine
permits
you
to
use
the
good
that
you
buy.
it
never
permits
you
to
make
another
item
from
that
item
you
bought.
so
that's
what
i
think
justice
breyer
is
saying,
which
is
you
can
use
the
seed,
you
can
plant
it,
but
what
you
can't
do
is
use
its
progeny
unless
you
are
licensed
to,
because
its
progeny
is
a
new
item.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
mean
they
don't
do
any
work,
they
don't
lay
the
soil
and
the
nutrients
it
needs,
water
when
it
needs
watering,
protect
it
from
animals?
they
do
no
work--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
growing
the
seed?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sure
if
they
don't
do
all
of
the
things
i
said,
it
doesn't
grow.
so
aren't
they
involved
in
its
creative
--
in
its
creation?
justice

mr.
waxman,
i
want
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
and
reformulate
it
as
a
different
question,
with
i
think
the
same
answer--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
i
just
want
to
make
sure
you
and
the
government
are
exactly
on
the
same
page.
both
of
you
are
suggesting,
i
think
--
that
was
ms.
sherry's
last
response
--
that
we
were
explicit
enough
in
quanta
and
we
don't
have
to
address
whatever
lingering
confusion
the
federal
circuit
may
have
with
respect
to
conditional
sales
at
all
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
you're
telling
us
we
don't
need
to
reach
that
prong
and
we
shouldn't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understand
we
don't
need
to,
but
the
question
is
should
we?
is
there
a
need--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--generally
in
--
in
clarifying
some
lingering
confusion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
actually
then
you
do
have
a
different
position
than
the
government
does.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
simplifying
this
case,
you
can't
take
the
person
who's
been
given
the
vaccine
and
take
vials
of
their
blood
and
keep
selling
it?
is
that
your--
