why--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
why
--
you
said
making
or
use
and
it
isn't
an
either-or
thing
then
--
as
the
other
side
has
pointed
out.
you
can
use
the
seed
to
make
new
seeds.
so
use
and
make
aren't
--
it's
not
either
you
use
it
or
you
make
it.
you
can
use
it
to
make
a
new
item.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
he
--
he
had
never
bought
any
monsanto
seeds.
he
just
goes
to
the
grain
elevator
and
90-odd
percent
of
those
seeds
have
the
genetic
composition.
so
--
and
he
planted
that
and
he
harvested
it.
would
he
be
infringing
on
monsanto's
patents?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
he
never
has
to
buy
any
seed
at
all
from
monsanto.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
just
said
that
--
that
we
haven't
had
a
case
involving
self-replicating.
i
mean,
the
exhaustion
doctrine
was
shaped
with
the
idea
of
an
article;
there
was
an
article
that
you
could
use
and
then
you
use
it
and
it's
used
up.
but
we
haven't
applied
the
exhaustion
doctrine
when
you
have
a
new
--
when
you
create
a
copy
of
the
original.
so
it's
--
it's
not
that
we
have
law
in
place.
we've
been
dealing
with
an
item
with
the
exhaustion
doctrine
and
now
we
have
hundreds
of
items,
thousands
of
items,
all
growing
from
that
original
seed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
may
--
they
may
they
own
them,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
infringing.
they
may
--
the
seeds
are
owned
by
the
farmer.
but
when
he
uses
them
to
grow
more
seeds,
he's
infringing
on
that
patent.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
ownership
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
couldn't
put
the
herbicide
on
--
he
couldn't
--
if
he
went
and
bought
conventional
seeds,
not
the
genetically
improved
seed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
--
then
he
wouldn't
--
what
would
the
yield
be
if
he
put
the
herbicide
on
it
and
they
were
all
killed?
