ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
by
talking
about
this
court's
decision
in
j.e.m.,
because
i
think
it
largely
resolves
this
case.
j.e.m.
was
a
patent
case,
and
the
issue
there
was
whether
or
not
you
could
get
a
utility
patent
on
a
plant.
the
argument
was
that
you
couldn't
get
a
utility
patent
because
the
plant
variety
protection
act
implicitly
repealed
the
patent
act
in
that
respect.
this
court
rejected
that
argument,
and
the
reason
it
rejected
that
argument
was
because
it
found
no
conflict
between
the
two
statutes.
the
reason
it
found
no
conflict
between
the
two
statutes
is
because
it
said
that
it
is
harder
to
get
a
utility
patent,
and
for
that
reason,
you
get
greater
protection
--
under
the
patent
act,
you
get
greater
rights
of
exclusion
under
the
patent
act
than
you
do
under
the
pvpa.
and
it
said,
most
notably,
there
is
no
seed
saving
exemption
in
the
patent
act,
there
is
no
research
exemption
in
the
patent
act.
the
consequence
of
petitioner's
argument
would
be
that
this
court
would
not
only
be
reading
a
seed-saving
exemption
into
the
patent
act,
and
a
research
exemption,
it
would
be
doing
much,
much,
much
more
under
the
guise
of
patent
exhaustion.
justice
breyer,
as
you
pointed
out,
the
exhaustion
doctrine
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
and
that's
because
the
exhaustion
doctrine
has
always
been
limited
to
the
particular
article
that
was
sold,
and
we
are
talking
about
a
different
article
here.
and
it's
never
extended
to
the
making
of
a
new
article.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
it's
true
that
the
court
hasn't
had
an
exhaustion
case
specifically
involving
the
sort
of
replicating
technology,
but
when
the
court
has
talked
about
exhaustion
it
has
always
focused
on
the
specific
article
that's
sold
and
it
has
done
that
for
a
reason.
the
concept
underlying
exhaustion
is
that
when
the
patentholder
controls
that
very
first
sale
it
gets
the
one
royalty
with
respect
to
the
actual
article
sold.
petitioner's
argument
isn't
limited
to
the
commodity
grain
that
we
are
talking
about.
it's
not
even
limited
--
when
you
talk
--
justice
breyer,
you
mentioned
the
three
different
generations
of
seeds.
there
is
actually
quite
a
few
more
generations
than
those
three.
if
the
concept
is
the
sale
of
a
parent
plant
exhausts
the
patentholder's
rights
not
only
with
respect
to
that
seed
but
with
respect
to
all
the
progeny
seed,
we
would
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
very
first
roundup
ready
plant
that
was
created
as
part
of
the
transformation
event.
every
single
roundup
ready
seed
in
existence
today
is
the
progeny
of
that
one
parent
plant
and,
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
that
would
eviscerate
patent
protections.
there
would
be
no
incentive
to
invest,
not
just
in
roundup
ready
soybeans
or
not
even
agricultural
technology,
but
it's
quite
a
bit
broader
than
that.
in
order
to
encourage
investment,
the
patent
act
provides
20
years
of
exclusivity.
this
would
be
reducing
the
20-year
term
to
essentially
one
and
only
sale.
it
would
be
near
impossible
to
recoup
your
investments
with
that
first
sale
and
so
the
more
likely
consequence
is
that
research
dollars
would
be
put
elsewhere.
the
other--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
the
answer
to
that
is
this
is
actually
not
a
traditional
farming
practice.
despite
what
petitioner
says,
farmers
do
not
generally
go
to
grain
elevators,
buy
commingled
grain,
plant
it
in
the
ground
as
seed.
if
you
look
at
the
american
soybean
association
brief
submitted
on
behalf
of
soybean
farmers,
it
says
as
much.
if
you
look
at
the
chs
brief
which
is
submitted
on
behalf
of
grain
elevators,
it
also
explains
that.
and
there
is
a
number
of
reasons
why
that
is
the
case.
there's
the
reasons
that
petitioner
talked
about,
which
is
that
they
an
undifferentiated
mix,
but
there
are
other
reasons
as
well.
the
business
of
grain
elevators
is
not
to
sell
commingled
grain
as
seed.
if
that
was
their
business
they
would
have
to
comply
with
seed
labeling
laws.
they
do
not
do
so
because
it's
not
their
business
model.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
but
farmers
wouldn't
be
able
to
use
it
for
another
reason
as
well.
even
if
you
take
patent
law
and
you
put
it
entirely
to
the
side,
there
is
still
the
plant
variety
protection
act.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
bowman
did,
absolutely
did
it
in
this
circumstance.
but
bowman
also
said
that
he
is
not
aware
of
other
farmers
who
are
engaging
in
this
practice.
and
again,
there
is
another
reason.
putting
aside
the
labeling
laws,
there
is
the
plant
variety
protection
act
and,
as
pioneer
points
out
in
their
amicus
brief,
it
is
quite
likely
that
a
large
amount
of
the
commingled
grain
is
not
only
protected
by
patent,
but
is
actually
protected
by
a
plant
variety
protection
certificate,
and
what
petitioner
did
here
would
infringe
the
plant
variety
protection
certificate.
so
even
putting
patent
law
to
the
side,
this
is
not
an
economically
viable
source
of
seed
for
farmers,
regardless.
and
petitioner's
argument
again
isn't
limited
to
the
grain
elevators.
it
would
apply
to
saving
your
own
seed
and
planting
it
generation
after
generation.
it
would
apply
to
selling
seeds
to
your
neighboring
farmer,
and
it
would
allow
seed
companies
to
essentially
compete
with
monsanto
upon
the
first
sale.
now
to
the
extent--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--the
patent
rights
are
exhausted
in
the
seed
at
the
same
time
they
are
exhausted
with
respect
to
any
other
product,
upon
an
authorized
sale.
and
so,
justice
breyer,
again
you
had
it
right
when
you
were
saying
that
you
can
do
what
you
want.
in
our
view,
once
there
is
an
authorized
sale
you
can
do
what
you
want
with
respect
to
the
seed
that
you've
actually
purchased.
that
is
the
tangible
article
you
paid
for.
but
you
do
need
permission
from
the
patentholder
in
order
to
make
a
new
generation
of
seed.
to
the
extent,
you
know,
any
middle
ground
is
warranted,
with
all
due
respect,
we
would
point
to
congress
as
the
appropriate
body.
this
court
said--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--if
monsanto
authorizes--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--right.
so
if
monsanto
authorized
that
first
sale
and
authorized
the
planting,
they
would
also
have
to
authorize
the
sale
of
the
second
generation
seed
because
it's
a
new
article.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
if
you
look
at
the
technology
agreement
--
and
it's
not
just
because
it's
a
contract
because
i
think
it's
significant
to
the
analysis
--
monsanto,
upon
the
first
sale
of
the
bag
of
roundup
ready
seed,
authorizes
the
planting
for
one
commercial
crop
and
it
authorizes
the
farmer
to
sell
that
as
a
commercial
crop
or
to
use
it
for
any
purpose
other
than
replanting.
that
is
an
authorized
sale.
so
if
you
take
that
second
generation
seed
--
“
second
generation
”
is
a
bit
of
a
misnomer,
but
if
you
take
that
seed
and
you
follow
it
through,
all
of
the
patent
rights
with
respect
to
that
particular
seed
have
been
exhausted.
but
you
cannot
take
that
seed
without
separate
authorization,
plant
it
in
the
ground,
and
come
up
with
the
next
generation
of
seed.
that
would
be--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--they
have
been
exhausted
with
respect
to
the
particular
article
sold.
when
the
court's
talked
about
patent
exhaustion,
you
are
not
exhausting
the
rights
with
respect
to
the
patented
invention.
you're
exhausting--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--yes,
and
that's
always
the
case
just
as
if
i
sell
--
i
mean,
even
if
you
think
in
the
copyright--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--but
i
think
there
is
other
technology
out
there.
i
mean,
even
if
you
think
of
software,
for
example,
there
are
plenty
of
other
products
where
one
reasonable
use
is
to
make
more.
i
can
purchase
software;
one
reasonable
use
would
be
to
make
a
dozen
other
copies
to
give
to
my
friends
or
sell
on
ebay.
it's
a
reasonable
use,
but
it's
an
infringing
one.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
the
court
hasn't
had
that
case
exactly,
but
it
did
decide
microsoft
v.
at&t,
and
granted
that
was
on
a
slightly
different
issue,
but
in
that
case
the
court
recognized
--
that
case,
it
was
copies
from
a
master
disk
and
it
treated
them
as
separate
copies
because
they
were
actually
separate
articles,
even
though
it
was
really
easy
to
do,
even
though
the
actual
copying
is
not
done
by
human
hands,
it's
done
by
mechanical
processes.
in
fact,
in
that
case
the
court
talked
and
compared
the
making
of
software
to
the
reproduction
through
biological
processes,
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
and
so
all
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
today
--
i
recognize
it's
a
new
technology
and
to
the
extent
new
technologies
require
different
rules,
congress
is
the
body
that
should
be
making
those
different
rules.
and
when
congress
has
acted
in
this
area
in
the
plant
variety
protection
act
and
also
in
the
software
context
in
the
copyright
act,
it
has
not
adopted
the
wholesale
exemption
that
petitioner
is
talking
for
here.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
your
honor,
may
i?
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
i
think
the
court
does
not
need
to
do
something
about
it
in
this
case.
i
think
quanta
largely
decided
the
issue,
even
though
it
didn't
say
so
explicitly,
and
as
far
as
i'm
aware
the
federal
circuit
has
not
applied
their
previous
version
of
the
conditional
sale
doctrine
to
enforce
the
post-sale
restrictions
since
this
court's
decision
in
quanta.
