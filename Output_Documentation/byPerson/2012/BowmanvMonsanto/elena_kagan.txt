well,
except
to
the
extent,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
purchase
is
going
to
use
the
article
just
to
create
a
new
one
of
the
exact
same
kind.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
the
basic
rule
that
says
that
the
purchaser
does
not
get
to
do
that
should
have
an
exception
for
self-replicating
technologies.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
walters,
can
you
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
opening
question,
because
the
chief
justice
asked
you
what
incentive
monsanto
would
have
to
produce
this
kind
of
product
if
you
were
right.
and
you
said,
well,
they
can
protect
themselves
by
contract.
actually,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
answer
is
purely
insufficient
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
because
all
that
has
to
happen
is
that
one
seed
escapes
the
web
of
these
contracts,
and
that
seed,
because
it
can
self-replicate
in
the
way
that
it
can,
essentially
makes
all
the
contracts
worthless.
so
again,
we
are
back
to
the
chief
justice's
problem,
that
monsanto
would
have
no
incentive
to
create
a
product
like
this
one.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
in
everything
you've
said
you
agree
with
mr.
waxman.
there
is
this
issue
in
the
case
where
you
disagree,
which
is
the
conditional
sale
doctrine.
i
am
just
wondering,
before
you
finish
up,
could
you
say
a
bit
about
whether
that
doctrine
is
causing
trouble
as
it
presently
exists
in
the
federal
circuit?
in
other
words,
could
we
just
ignore
that
doctrine
if
we
wanted
to,
or
is
it
a
very
problematic
one
that
we
should
take
this
opportunity
to
do
something
about?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
waxman,
there
is
a
worrisome
thing
on
the
other
side,
though,
too.
and
that
is
the
bureau
position
has
the
--
has
the
capacity
to
make
infringers
out
of
everybody.
and
that
is
highlighted
actually
in
this
case
by
how
successful
this
product
is
and
how
large
a
percentage
of
the
market
it
has
had.
so
that
--
you
know,
seeds
can
be
blown
onto
a
farmer's
farm
by
wind,
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
roundup
seeds
there
and
the
farmer
is
infringing,
or
there's
a
10-year-old
who
wants
to
do
a
science
project
of
creating
a
soybean
plant,
and
he
goes
to
the
supermarket
and
gets
an
edamame,
and
it
turns
out
that
it's
roundup
seeds.
[laughter]
and,
you
know,
these
roundup
seeds
are
everywhere,
it
seems
to
me.
there's,
what,
90
percent
of
all
the
seeds
that
are
around?
so
it
seems
as
though
--
like
pretty
much
everybody
is
an
infringer
at
this
point,
aren't
they?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
i'll
change
my
hypothetical.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
and
i
thought
i
was
being
so
clever,
too.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
monsanto
invented
and
then
patented
a
genetic
modification
that
enables
soybean
plants
to
survive
exposure
to
glyphosate,
the
active
ingredient
in
many
herbicides.
monsanto
calls
seeds
carrying
this
trait,
roundup
ready
seeds.
monsanto
will
only
sell
roundup
ready
seed
to
farmers
who
sign
a
licensing
agreement.
that
agreement
allows
farmers
to
plant
one
and
only
crop
of
soybeans
from
the
roundup
ready
seed
they
purchase.
the
farmer
can
then
consume
the
harvested
beans
or
sell
them
as
a
commodity.
but
the
farmer
cannot
do
according
to
the
agreement
is
saved
and
replants
the
soybeans
he
harvests.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
vernon
bowman,
is
a
farmer
who
likes
roundup
ready
technology.
for
his
first
soybean
crop
each
year,
bowman
purchased
roundup
ready
seed
from
a
monsanto
affiliate
and
complied
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement,
i
just
described.
but
for
his
riskier,
second
soybean
crop
of
each
season,
bowman
wanted
a
way
to
rip
the
benefits
of
monsanto's
technology
without
paying
its
premium
prices.
the
answer,
bowman
decided,
lay
and
buying
seeds
from
the
local
grain
elevator.
soybeans
from
a
grain
elevator
are
meant
for
consumption,
but
because
soybeans
are
themselves
seeds
nothing
prevented
bowman
from
planting
them.
and
because
most
indiana
farmers
used
roundup
ready
seed,
bowman
suspected
that
most
of
the
grain
elevator
soybeans
he
purchased
would
carry
the
roundup
ready
trait.
he
was
right.
when
bowman
planted
the
grain
elevator
soybeans
and
applied
glyphosate
to
his
fields
most
of
the
soybeans
plants
survived.
bowman
then
saved
seed
from
that
crop
of
roundup
ready
beans
for
his
second
planting
the
next
year,
and
bowman
repeated
that
process
year
after
year
for
eight
years.
so,
he
was
able
to
produce
eight
crops
a
roundup
ready
soybeans
all
without
buying
any
seed
from
monsanto.
when
monsanto
discovered
this
practice,
it
sued
bowman
for
patent
infringement.
the
question
here
is
whether
bowman
can
defend
against
monsanto
suit
based
on
what's
called
the
?doctrine
of
patent
exhaustion.
under
that
doctrine,
the
authorized
sale
of
a
patented
article
gives
the
purchaser
or
any
subsequent
owner
like
bowman
the
right
to
use
or
resell
that
article
without
the
patent
holder's
permission.
the
district
court
held
a
patented
exhaustion
did
not
protect
bowman's
conduct
and
ordered
him
to
pay
damages
to
monsanto.
the
federal
circuit
affirmed.
we
also
agree.
we
hold
that
patent
exhaustion
does
not
allow
a
farmer
to
reproduce
patented
seeds
through
planting
and
harvesting
without
the
patent
holders
permission.
as
i
just
explained,
exhaustion
prevents
a
patent
holder
from
controlling
the
use
or
resale
of
a
patented
article
after
that
article
is
sold.
the
patent
exhaustion
has
always
been
limited
to
the
specific
article
sold.
it
does
not
entitled
the
purchaser
of
a
patented
item
to
replicate
that
item
at
will.
that
limit
exists
for
a
simple
reason.
if
anyone
who
bought
a
patented
invention
could
make
and
sell
new
copies
of
that
invention,
then
the
patent
would
not
be
of
much
value.
that
principle
decides
this
case.
here,
bowman
bought
soybeans,
most
of
which
contained
monsanto's
invention.
he
planted
those
beans,
he
applied
glyphosate
to
the
plants
killing
any
that
did
not
contain
monsanto's
invention,
and
then
he
harvested
the
resulting
roundup
ready
soybeans
ending
up
with
many,
many
more
of
those
patented
beans
than
he
started
with.
that
is
how
you
make
new
copies
of
a
patented
item
when
that
item
is
a
seed.
and
so
the
exhaustion
doctrine
does
not
shield
bowman's
activity.
if
the
rule
were
otherwise
patents
on
seeds
would
be
largely
worthless
because
as
soon
as
the
first
few
seeds
were
sold,
anyone
else
could
reproduce
and
sell
them.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
federal
circuit,
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
