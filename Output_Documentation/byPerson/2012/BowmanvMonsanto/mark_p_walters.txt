mr.
mark
p.
walters
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
patent
exhaustion
provides
that
once
a
patented
article
is
sold,
it
passes
outside
the
protection
of
the
patent
act.
it
is
available
to
be
used
by
the
purchaser
to
practice
the
invention.
now,
what's
the
invention
here?
the
invention
is
a
bit
of
dna
that,
when
asserted
into
a
soy
bean
seed,
makes
that
seed
and
all
the
plants
that
grow
from
that
seed
resistant
to
the
active
ingredient
in
roundup.
now,
the
only
way
to
practice
that
invention
is
to
plant
the
seed
and
to
grow
more
seeds.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
i
agree
no
one
would
do
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
is
the
situation
here.
i
think
we
have,
and
we
have
explained
how
respondents
here
can
protect
their
invention
through
contracts.
they
don't
have
to
sell
it
outright.
they
can
sell
it
through
an
agency
model,
but
i
think
the
more
important--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--correct.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
well,
part
of
the
patent
policy
as
well
is
to
protect
the
purchaser,
and
that's
been
part
of
this
court's
law
for
more
than
150
years.
under
respondent's
theory,
any
farmer
who
grows
a
soy
bean
seed
is
infringing
the
patent
but
for
the
grace
of
monsanto.
and
that's
--
a
lot
of
farmers
in
this
country,
when
we
have
over
90
percent
of
the
acreage
that
is
roundup
ready.
so
under
monsanto's
theory,
there
is
really
no
limit
by
the
exhaustion
doctrine?
mr.
mark
p.
walters
is
infringing
under
license
by
monsanto.
let's
take
the
first--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--the
reach
of
monsanto's
theory
is
that
once
that
seed
is
sold,
even
though
title
has
passed
to
the
farmer,
and
the
farmer
assumes
all
risks
associated
with
farming,
that
they
can
still
control
the
ownership
of
that
seed,
control
how
that
seed
is
used.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
if
we
don't
apply
--
if
exhaustion
is
eliminated,
rather,
for
the
progeny
seed,
then
you
are
taking
away
the
ability
of
people
to
exchange
these
goods
freely
in
commerce.
you
have
essentially
a
servitude
on
these
things
that
are
exchanged,
and
every
grain
elevator
who
makes
a
sale
is
infringing.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
if
you
assume
that
there
is
exhaustion
in
the
seeds
that
are
sold
to
the
farmer
--
let's
take
our
particular
case
here.
mr.
bowman
went
to
a
grain
elevator
and
he
bought
from
the
grain
elevator
without
restriction
seeds
to
--
with
his
purpose
to
plant
them.
now,
the
only
way
that
he
can
make
use
--
if
you
assume
in
the
first
instance
that
there
is
exhaustion
to
the
seeds
that
mr.
bowman
purchased
from
the
grain
elevator,
you
are
taking
away
any
ability
for
him
to
use
that
seed
or
use
the
invention.
let's
take
for
example
claim
130
which
is
at
supplemental
appendix
19,
that
is
a
method
for
selectively
controlling
weeds
in
a
field.
it
has
two
elements;
the
first
element
is
planting
the
crop
seed
and
it's
a
particular
crop
seed
with
all
the
particular
genetics
that
encode
for
resistance
to
roundup,
and
then
the
next
step
is
to
apply
to
the
crop
and
weeds
in
the
field
a
sufficient
amount
of
glyphosate
herbicide.
now,
if
you
say
that
there
is
exhaustion
in
the
seeds
that
mr.
bowman
purchased
from
the
grain
elevator
but
you
say
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
progeny,
you
are
not
allowing
him
to
actually
practice
the
invention
to
grow
more
seeds.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
no.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
well,
i
guess
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
justice
breyer,
my
response
is,
if
you
applied
the
law
that
way
to
side
making
over
use,
you
are
eliminating
the
exhaustion
doctrine
in
the
context
of
--
of
patented
seeds.
you're
saying
that
he
can
do--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--anything
but
practice
the
invention.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
the
point
of
the
invention
here.
if
you
look
at
claim
130
again,
for
example,
you
are
saying
he
can't
practice
claim
130,
which
is
certainly
embodied
in
the
seeds
he
purchased
from
the
grain
elevator.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
no.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
well,
in
practical
matters
it
doesn't
work
that
way,
because
the
seed
that's
available
at
a
grain
elevator
is
not
a
very
good
source
of
seed
and
farmers
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
eliminate
the
need
to
go
to
monsanto
or
the
other
seed
companies
every
year
by
going
to
the
grain
elevator.
great
evidence
of
that
is
the
fact
that
my
client,
every
year
that
he
planted
a
second
crop
using
the
grain
elevator
seed,
he
bought
high
quality
seed
from
pioneer.
now,
if
this
grain
elevator
--
grain
elevator
seed
was
so
good,
why
didn't
he
use
it
for
his
first
crop?
mr.
mark
p.
walters
your
honor,
that's
an
exception
to
the
exhaustion
doctrine
for
self-replicating
inventions.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
the
invention
here
is--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--it
is
not
there.
this
--
this
court
has
--
has
not
created
an
exception
to
the
exhaustion
doctrine
and
in
fact
it's
explicitly
said
it
won't
do
that
and
that's
an
act
--
and
that's
an
activity
for
congress.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
this
is
obviously
a
brand-new
case
where
we're
dealing
with
the
--
the
doctrine
of
patent
exhaustion
in
the
context
of
self-replicating
technologies.
so
what
you
have
here
is
if
you
take
the
federal
circuit's
view,
then
you
have
no
--
you
have
no
exhaustion
at
all
for
someone
to
practice
the
invention.
sure,
you
can
do
all
the
things
that
you
talked
about,
mr.
breyer
--
or
justice
breyer,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
or
with
the
invention.
so
you're
taking
the
exhaustion
doctrine
for
self-replicating
inventions,
you're
modifying
this
court's
case
law
substantially,
and
that's
something
that
ought
to
be
done
in
congress.
in
fact--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--the
exhaustion
doctrine,
the
policy
that
underlies
this
court's
cases
is
fundamentally
a
choice
about
the
purchaser's
rights
in
that
personal
property
over
the
patentee's
rights
in
the
monopoly
to
use
that
monopoly
and
increase
its
sales.
this
court
has
always
chosen
the
purchaser's
rights
over
the
patentee's
rights
to
increase
sales.
and
we're
just
asking
you
to
make
the
same
choice
here.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
first,
we
disagree
that
the
activity
of
basic
farming
could
be
considered
making
the
invention.
if
you
read
the
statute,
it
says
making
the
invention,
not
just
making
a
copy
like
it
would
be
in
the
copyright
act.
we
have
the
invention,
which
is
a
particular
genetic
sequence
that
was
made
principally
by
monsanto's
genetic
engineers.
and
farmers,
when
they
plant
seeds,
they
don't
exercise
any
control
or
dominion
over
--
over
their
crop.
otherwise,
every
year
they'd
have
a
bumper
crop.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
they
absolutely--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--they
absolutely
do
work,
but
they
don't
have
control
over
the
creative
process.
they
plant,
they
spray
and
they
pray.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
they
certainly
aren't
in
control
of
it.
you
ask
any
farmer
who's
lived
through
a
drought
or
through
a
terrible
flood
and
they
will
say
they're
not
the
ones
who
are
making
these--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--absolutely.
and
--
and
that's
how
broad
this
position
is.
it
doesn't
matter
how
you
come
into
possession
with
these
seeds.
you
are
committing
patent
infringement
if
you
--
any
cell
division
is
patent
infringement.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
thank
you,
justice
breyer.
what
monsanto
wants
to
do
in
your
scenario
is
they
want
the
farmer
to
assume
all
the
risks
of
farming.
they
want
--
but
they
still
want
to
control
and
act
as
owners
of
the
property
that
is
owned
no
doubt
by
that
farmer.
when
that
farmer
grows
the
progeny
seed,
they
insure
the
risk
that
they're
not
going
to
have
a
crop
in
the
first
place.
if
they
drive
to
the
grain
dealer
to
sell
their
harvest
--
they
get
one
paycheck
a
year,
by
the
way
--
they,
if
they
get
into
a
wreck,
that's
not
monsanto's
problem;
that's
the
farmer's
problem.
so
what
they're
essentially
asking
for
is
for
the
farmers
to
bear
all
the
risks
of
farming,
yet
they
can
sit
back
and
control
how
that
property
is
used.
and
that's
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
how
this
court
has
interpreted
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
thing
that's
very
important
is
this
is
not
a
license,
this
is
an
outright
sale
to
the
farmers
of
the
first
generation.
and
then
they
are
--
they
plant
those
seeds
because
they
have,
under
the
exhaustion
doctrine,
a
right
to
use
the
invention,
and
then
those
progeny
seeds
are
owned
outright
by
every
farmer,
and
they
assume
all
risk
of
loss.
so
if
--
if
--
monsanto
wants
to
control--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--it's
the
servitude
on
the
title.
and
those
things
get
sold
to
the
grain
elevators,
and
now
every
time
the
grain
elevator
makes
a
sale,
it's
technically
infringing.
and
--
and
that's
something
that
our
law
has
never
allowed
for
centuries.
and
one
of
the
main
problems
is
that
you
have
farmers,
their
main
livelihood
here
is
to
sell
the
seeds
that
they
grow.
now,
if
they
don't
have
clear
title
and
if
they
don't
have
the
ability
to
sell
the
property
that
they
--
that
they
grow,
then
that
impinges
upon
their
ability
to
make
a
living.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
you
know,
most
farmers
are
not
growing
soybeans
for
--
for
seed.
there
are
various
types
of--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--various
types
of
farmers
who
are
--
who
are
growing
foundation
seed,
for
example,
that
is
very
close
to
the
--
to
the
first
generation
seed
that's
engineered.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
they
are.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
taking
our
example
here
where
--
where
petitioner
bought
commodity
seeds,
it's
an
undifferentiated
mixture,
it
can't
be
overemphasized
how
different
every
single
seed
is,
you
don't
know
a
monsanto
from
a
pioneer
from
an
asgrow.
you
don't
know
the
maturity
rate.
if
i
am
a
farmer,
i
need
a
particular
maturity
bean
for
my
field
because
i
don't
want
it
to
mature
before
it
gets
high
enough
for
the
combine
to
come
around
and
cut
it.
so
you
want
to
be
able
to
have
--
you
have
all
these
things
dialed
in,
these
different
variabilities.
so
if
you
go
to
the
grain
elevator
and
you
don't
know
what
exactly
it
is
that
you
want
and
you
just
get
a
mixture,
that's
not
going
to
be
real
--
competitive
at
all
to
monsanto's
first
generation
seed.
now,
the
possibility
of
somebody
selecting
one
and
saying,
ah,
that's
the
exact
one
that
i
need
for
my
field,
i'm
going
to
cultivate
that
and
let
it
grow
into
enough
seeds
so
i
can
plant
my
first
crop,
that
would
take
a
number
of
years
to
grow
a
1,000-acre
farm,
and
it's
not
--
and
by
that
time,
farmers
--
the
nature
would
have
changed
and
evolved
where
you
would
want
the
latest
disease
resistance
by
that
point.
so
there
are--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--well,
he--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--no.
actually,
he
did
something
quite
different.
he
didn't
select
a
particular
variety.
he
selected
for
the
particular
trait,
roundup
ready,
but
there
are
probably
more
than
a
dozen
different
ways
in
which
the
seed
can
vary
--
disease
resistance,
maturity
rates.
and
if
you
are
a
farm--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--that's
correct.
but
if
you
look
at
a
field
that
you've
planted
with
grain
elevator
seed,
it's
going
to
be
all
different
colors,
because
they're
going
to
be
all
different
varieties,
they're
all
going
to
mature
at
a
different
rate.
so
that
if
--
when
it
comes
harvest
time,
some
of
them
are
going
to
be
too
close
to
the
ground
so
that
your
combine's
going
to
miss--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--including
the
monsanto
seeds.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
absolutely.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
it's
a
problem
each
time.
this
is
a
very
poor
choice
--
choice
of
seed,
but
it
only
makes
sense
to
plant
in
a
risky
situation,
like
when
a
farmer
has
been
washed
out
from
a
flood,
for
example,
and
it's
late
in
the--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--yes.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
i'm
sorry.
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
question.
the
commodity
seeds,
with
--
the
roundup
ready
commodity
seeds
will
all
grow
at
different
rates
and
have
different
disease
resistance,
different
maturity
rates.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
correct.
so--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--exactly.
they're
a
uniform
variety.
they
are
exactly
what
a
farmer
needs
for
their--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
it
makes
sense.
i
mean,
they
allow
these
seeds
to
be
dumped
into
the
common
grain
elevator.
they
don't
put
any
restrictions
on
what
the
elevator
does
with
it.
there
were
no
restrictions
on
my
client
when
he
purchased
them
from
the
grain
elevator.
so
it's
less
of
a
problem
for
monsanto
for
people
going
to
the
grain
elevator
to
plant.
nevertheless,
it's
--
it's
an
outright
sale,
an
exhaustion
applies
to
that
particular
sale,
and
permits
that
farmer
to
use
it.
it's
never
going
to
be
a
threat
to
monsanto's
business,
people
planting
grain
elevator
seed.
now,
to
answer
your
question,
justice
kagan,
about
--
well,
under
our
theory,
if
somebody
does
breach
a
contract
with
monsanto,
they
don't
have
to
do
it
under
contract
law,
they
can
actually
do
it
under
an
agency
model
like
general
electric
did
in
the
1920s.
and
then
that's
only
fair
because
there,
the
agent
growers
are
assuming
--
well,
monsanto
was
assuming
the
risk
that
the
farmers
are.
and
there
is
some
equitability
there
with
the
--
the
risk
sharing
between
the
farmers
and
monsanto.
now
they
want
the
farmers
to
take
all
the
risks
associated
with
farming,
yet
they
want
to
control
how
they
use
those
seeds
all
the
way
down
the
distribution
chain.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
i'd
like
to
first
address
the
statement
that
this
is
not
a
traditional
farming
practice.
it
may
be
occasional,
when
a
farmer
is
in
a
real
desperate
situation,
or
it
may
apply
to
mr.
bowman's
situation,
where
he
wanted
a
very
cheap
source
of
seed
for
his
second
crop.
but
in
the
record
at
153a,
among
other
places,
he
discusses
how
he's
gone
to
the
grain
elevator
over
the
years
a
number
of
times,
and
how
other
farmers
have
gone
to
the
grain
elevator
for
generations.
so
a
ruling
in
favor
of
monsanto
here
would
effectively
eliminate
that
seed--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--no.
i
do
not.
and
what
he
is
referring
to
is
state
labeling
laws
that
prevent
grain
elevators
from
actually
scooping
up
grain,
packaging
it
up
and
saying
this
is
seed,
because
they
all
look
alike
to
--
to
the
eye.
and
so
grain
elevators
are
certainly
not
allowed
to
dupe
seed
purchasers,
but
those
laws
are
there
to
protect
the
seed
purchasers.
mr.
bowman
bought
grain
without
any
restrictions
on
how
he
could
use
it.
that
broke
no
laws,
and
it
does
not
violate
the
pvpa.
i
mean,
monsanto
didn't
assert
a
pvpa
certificate.
surely
it
has
them.
did
not
assert
them
in
this
case
and
could
not
assert
them
in
this
case
because
there's
no
single
variety
that
mr.
bowman
planted.
so
that's
not
a
good
argument.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
that
case
is
not
on
point,
your
honor.
that
had
to
do
with
271(f),
and
actually
came
out
on
the
side
of
more
restrictive
patent
rights.
and
this
is
not
like
software.
this
is
an
invention
that
the
only
way
to
use
the
invention
--
now,
repeat,
the
only
way
to
use
the
invention
--
is
to
plant
it
and
to
grow
more
seeds.
so
if
you
don't
apply
the
exhaustion
doctrine
and
allow
someone
to
use
it,
you're
choosing
patent
rights
over
personal
property
rights,
and
that's
never
been
done
in
150
years
of
this
court's
exhaustion
cases.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
that
is
certainly
a
use,
but
it's
not
the
invention.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
well,
that's
not
use.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
that's
not
use
of
the
invention,
justice
breyer.
and
exhaustion
is
about
conferring
on
the
purchaser
a
right
to
use
the
invention.
there's
no
limit
to
monsanto's--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--the
same
argument
came
up
in
quanta,
your
honor,
with--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--there
were
other
uses
for
the
computer
chips,
of
course,
that
were
asserted.
and
the
key
was
that
those
computer
chips
practiced
the
patent.
and
you
would
swallow
up
the
exhaustion
doctrine
entirely
if
we
just
could
think
of
other
uses
for
these
things
that
have
been
sold.
the
key
is,
does
it
use
--
is
the
purchaser
allowed
to
use
the
invention?
and
under
monsanto's
theory,
the
purchaser
isn't
allowed
to
do
that.
and
that's
no
exhaustion
doctrine
at
all--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--but
the
only
use
of
the
invention
is
to
plant
it,
and
that's
the
use
that
mr.
bowman
makes.
mr.
mark
p.
walters
so
--
the
judgment
in
this
case
was
based
on
acres
planted,
and
so
i'm
not
sure
how
many
--
we
talked
a
bit
about
the
n
plus
2
generation,
and
we
don't
know
in
the
record
what
the
n
plus
2
generation
was,
in
terms
of
his
sales
or
his
yields.
that
wasn't
before
the
district
court
on
summary
judgment.
so
i'm
not
sure
how
you
could
affirm
based
on
the
judgment
below,
which
was
a
finding
that
conditional
sales
prevented
the
application
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
other
thing--
mr.
mark
p.
walters
--could
you
ask
it
again?
mr.
mark
p.
walters
but
you're
saying
that
there's
no
exhaustion
in
the
progeny
where
he
owns
that
seed
outright.
with
that,
we'll
submit,
and
we'll
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
thank
you.
