justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
you
are
allowing
him
to
use
those
seeds
for
anything
else
he
wants
to
do.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
those
seeds.
there
are
three
generations
of
seeds.
maybe
three
generations
of
seeds
is
enough.
[laughter]
it
is
for
this
example.
first
of
you
have
the
monsanto,
the
first
generation
they
sold.
they
have
children,
which
is
the
second
generation.
and
those
children
have
children,
which
is
the
third
generation,
okay?
so,
bad
joke.
so,
we
are
talking
here
--
he
can
do
what
he
wants
with
the
first
generation.
anything
he
wants.
and
moreover,
when
he
buys
them
from
monsanto,
he
can
make
new
seeds.
he
can
make
generation
two,
because
they've
licensed
him
to
do
it.
here,
he
buys
generation
two.
now,
he
can
do
what
he
wants
with
those
seeds.
but
i'll
tell
you,
there
is
a
problem,
because
the
coming
about
of
the
third
generation
is
itself
the
infringement.
so
the
second
generation
seeds
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
if
he
went
into
a
room
and
had
a
box
that
he
bought
from
a
lab
and
he
put
rocks
in
it
and
he
said,
hocus-pocus
and
lo
and
behold
out
came
the
third
generation
of
seeds,
he
would
have
infringed
monsanto's
patent
with
that
third
generation,
would
he
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
he
wouldn't
have?
you
mean
if
he
goes
and
finds
a
new
way
of
making
these
seeds
which
happens
to
be
you
pick
some
grass
and
you
intertwine
it
and
various
things
like
that
and
lo
and
behold
you
have
a
perfect
copy
of
monsanto's
patented
seed,
he
hasn't
made
it,
he
hasn't
infringed?
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
the
same
with
the
grass
as
with
the
magic
box.
i
am
saying
the
problem
for
you
here,
i
think,
is
that,
infringement
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
made
generation
three.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
generation
two.
that
has
just
a
coincidence.
but
that
is
in
fact
the
way
he
made
these
seeds.
but
he
can
sell,
resell
generation
2,
he
can
do
whatever
he
wants
with
it.
if
he
sterilizes
it
and
uses
them
in
a
circus,
he
can
do
it.
the
only
thing
he
cannot
do
is
he
cannot
create
generation
3,
just
as
he
couldn't
use
generation
2
seeds
to
rob
a
bank.
you
know,
there
are
certain
things
that
the
law
prohibits.
what
it
prohibits
here
is
making
a
copy
of
the
patented
invention.
and
that
is
what
he
did.
so
it's
generation
3
that
concerns
us.
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still
not
getting
the
answer.
i'm
going
to
try
once
more.
now,
when
you
buy
generation
2,
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
can
do
with
it.
you
can
feed
it
to
animals,
you
can
feed
it
to
your
family,
make
tofu
turkeys.
i
mean,
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
can
do
with
it,
all
right.
but
i'll
give
you
two
that
you
can't
do.
one,
you
can't
pick
up
those
seeds
that
you've
just
bought
and
throw
them
in
a
child's
face.
you
can't
do
that
because
there's
a
law
that
says
you
can't
do
it.
now,
there's
another
law
that
says
you
cannot
make
copies
of
a
patented
invention.
and
that
law
you
have
violated
when
you
use
it
to
make
generation
3,
just
as
you
have
violated
the
law
against
assault
were
you
to
use
it
to
commit
an
assault.
now,
i
think
that's
what
the
federal
circuit
is
trying
to
get
at.
and
so
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
it
has
to
do
with
some
other
doctrine
perhaps
that
--
that
somehow
you
think
should
give
you
the
right
to
use
something
that
has
as
a
basic
purpose
making
a
copy
of
itself.
maybe
you
should,
but
i
don't
see
that.
where
is
that
in
the
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
there?
is
that
--
is
that
there
in
the
exhaustion
doctrine?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
going
to
respond.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
respond
to
me
that
my
question
then
makes
it
infringement
when
your
client
buys
generation
1
from
monsanto,
because
they
buy
generation
1
from
monsanto,
they
plant
it
in
the
ground
and,
lo
and,
behold,
up
comes
generation
2.
and
generation
2,
on
the
basis
of
what
i
was
asking
you,
is
just
as
much
a
violation.
but
i
think,
though
i'll
find
out
from
them,
that
the
response
of
that
is,
yes,
you're
right,
it
is
just
as
much
a
violation.
that's
why
we,
monsanto,
give
the
buyer
a
license
to
do
it.
and
so
it
all
seems
to
work
out.
you
don't
need
any
exception.
there's
no
exception
from
anything.
when
you
create
a
new
generation,
you
have
made
a
patented
item,
which
you
cannot
do
without
the
approval
of
the
patent
owner.
therefore,
monsanto
gives
that
approval
when
you
buy
generation
1.
now,
it
seems
to
me
all
to
work
out
without
any
need
for
exception.
and
i'm
putting
to
you
my
whole
thought
so
that
you
can
respond
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
--
i
mean,
that
is
an
interesting
question,
because
you
can
imagine
--
you
see,
this
is
--
your
answer
--
this
really
deals
with
all
--
it
could
be
with
genetic
patents,
with
--
with
hosts
of
things
which
are
self-replicating.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
some
of
the
self-replicating
items,
which
are
infringing
items,
end
up
inadvertently
all
over
the
place.
is
there
anything
in
the
patent
law
that
deals
with
that?
is
an
involuntary
infringer
treated
the
same
under
patent
law
as
a
voluntary
infringer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
--
is
there
precautions
that
you
take?
i
mean,
is
there
anything
in
patent
law
that
helps?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
person
plants
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
he
plants
it,
but
he
doesn't
even
know,
you
know.
he's
just
got
--
we
can
imagine
a
lot
of
circumstances
where
this
would
be
a
--
where
justice
kagan's
question
could
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
just
saying
that
would
need
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--modification
in
patent
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
--
what
about
the
other
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
no,
no,
i
want
to
go
back
to
a
different
question
that
was
asked,
which
was
the
question
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
about
this
other
aspect
of
the
case,
the
licensing
aspect?
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
it
doesn't
concern
monsanto's
license
of
generation
1,
because
insofar
as
it's
relevant
here
generation
1
carries
the
license
that
is
just
permissive.
it
is
to
create
generation
2.
but
--
but
they
also
said
something
in
the
circuit
about
a
license
--
about
a
restriction,
implied
perhaps,
on
--
on
the
use
of
generation
2
by
the
grain
elevator
for
creating
generation
3,
namely
you
can't
do
that.
now,
they
--
they
thought,
the
circuit,
that
there's
some
restriction
in
a
license
and
they
have
a
doctrine
that
seems
to
say
that
you
can
restrict
licenses
--
through
licenses
the
use
of
a
product
after
it's
been
sold.
and
that
would
seem
contrary
to
the
first
sale
doctrine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't
need
that
because
in
each
instance,
as
you
say,
you
are
making
new
ones.
it's
the
making
of
the
new
ones,
not
the
use
of
the
old
ones,
where
you
prevent
that
from
being
done.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
use
the
word
“
use
”.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
you
use
the
word
“
use
”
and
you
get
to
the
same
place.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
you
can
think
of
an
example.
i
mean,
you
say
--
i
don't
think
you
can
think
of
an
example
where
if
you
win
on
the
other
ground,
you
can
produce
a
bad
result
for
the
manufacturer
or
the
inventor
because
you
haven't
treated
the
conditional
sale
like
a
license.
i'm
not
saying
you
can't,
i
just
can't
think
of
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
lease
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
lease
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
people
or
animals
eat
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
why
is
it
the
only
way
you
can
do
is
to
plant
them?
that
isn't
the
only
thing
you
could
do
with
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
can
buy
them
from
the
grain
elevator
and
sell
them
for
other
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
invented
thing.
the
invented
aspect
of
the
seed
is
it
has
a
gene
in
it
that
repels
some
other
insecticide
or
something
that
they
have.
i
understand
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
use
that.
i
don't
think
they
used
that
particular
--
well,
go
ahead.
you
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
people
buying
from
grain
elevators
are
mostly
people
who
take
these
chips
--
whatever
they
are,
the
seeds
--
and
they
sell
them
for
making
tofu,
or
they
sell
them
to
eat,
or
this
--
there
are
loads
of
uses,
aren't
there?
