i
didn't
understand
that
last
sentence.
any
farmer
who
plants
and
grows
soybeans
is
violating
the
patent?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
their
claim
is
he
only
violates
the
patent
if
he
tries
to
grow
additional
seeds
from
his
first
crop.
right?
isn't
that
the
only
claim
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
that
seed.
it's
different
seed.
that
seed
is
done.
it's
been
planted
in
the
ground
and
has
grown
other
seed.
it's
the
other
seed
we
are
talking
about.
it's
not
the
very
seed
that
was
sold.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
this.
i
thought
soybeans
are
seeds.
justice
antonin
scalia
including
the
monsanto
seeds?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
of
them
would
--
would
grow
at
different
rates
than
others.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
original
batch
that
he
buys
from
monsanto?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
original
batch
that
he
buys
from
monsanto,
in
addition
to
being
resistant
to
the
chemical
that
kills
the
weeds,
in
addition
to
that,
they
all
mature
at
the
same
rate.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
the
monsanto
seeds
are
not
--
are
not
fungible.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
some
of
them
that
mature
early,
some
mature
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
pretty
horrible
result,
but
let
me
give
you
another
horrible
result,
and
that
is
if
--
if
we
agree
with
you,
farmers
will
not
be
able
to
do
a
second
planting
by
simply
getting
the
undifferentiated
seeds
from
a
grain
elevator,
because
at
least
a
few
of
those
seeds
will
always
be
patented
seeds,
and
no
farmer
could
ever
plant
anything
from
a
grain
elevator,
which
means
--
i
gather
they
use
it
for
second
plantings
where
the
risks
are
so
high
that
it
doesn't
pay
to
buy
expensive
seed.
now
they
can't
do
that
any
more
because
there's
practically
no
grain
elevator
that
doesn't
have
at
least
one
patented
seed
in
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
it's
so
cheap.
and
that's
why
farmers
--
and
that's
why
farmers
want
to
use
it,
for
a
cheap
planting.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
you
can
do
it
once?
i
don't
know
what
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--one
shot
of
a
gun.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
rob
a
bank
with
it,
though,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
that
it's
unlawful
for
grain
elevators
to
sell
it
for
replanting?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
--
but
that's
--
nothing
prevents
him
from
planting
it.
what
he
is
prevented
from
doing
is
using
the
--
the
consequences
of
that
planting,
the
second
generation
seeds,
for
another
planting.
that's
all
he
is
prevented
from
doing.
he
can
plant
and
harvest
and
eat
or
sell.
he
just
can't
plant,
harvest,
and
then
replant.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
you're
saying
that
you
are
preventing
him
from
using
it.
he's
not
prevented
from
using
it.
he
can
use
it
for
what
it's
meant
for,
for
raising
a
crop.
he
just
cannot
use
the
product
--
that
new
crop
--
for
replanting.
that's
all.
he
has
to
sell
that
new
crop
for
feed
or
for
some
other
purpose.
but
to
say
that
--
that
he's
prevented
from
using
what
he
has
bought
is
simply
not
true.
he
can
use
it,
plant
it,
and
harvest
the
crop.
