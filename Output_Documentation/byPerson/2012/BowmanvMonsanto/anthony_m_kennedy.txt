justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
may
be
right
in
the
way
you
characterize
monsanto's
argument,
and
i
have
great
difficulties
with
characterizing
it
that
way,
as
justice
scalia's
question
indicates.
but
monsanto
can
still
prevail
if
you
say
that
there's
a
patent
infringement
if
he
plants
it
for
seed
and
uses
the
seed
to
replant.
that's
not
as
far
as
monsanto
goes,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
one
way
to
characterize
their
argument
and
to
make
it
sensible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
only
one
question
so
far,
and
it's
a
farming
question.
with
some
crops
if
you
are
going
to
make
seeds,
you
leave
the
crop
in
longer.
in
--
what
about
soybeans?
if
the
farmer
has
the
north
40
and
the
south
40,
the
north
40,
he's
going
to
plants
soybeans
to
be
used
for
flour,
human
consumption,
and
south
40,
he
wants
seeds.
does
he
leave
the
plants
in
the
ground
the
same
amount
of
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
would
not?
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
--
if
you're
going
to
use
the
soybeans
for
seeds
as
opposed
to
flour,
do
you
leave
them
in
the
ground
any
longer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
please
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong.
i
thought
that's
exactly
what
bowman
did
here.
he
went
to
a
grain
elevator
and
he
--
he
used
the
seeds,
and
--
and
he
didn't
know
exactly
the
percentage
mix,
but
he
used
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
he
did
exactly
what
you
said
is
uneconomical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong;
i
thought
that
is
what
bowman
did.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
--
could
you
prevail
in
this
case
if
we
focused
just
on
use
rather
than
make?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
do
have
this
problem
that
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
example.
what
about
the
commodity
bin
that
has
2
percent
of
the
patented
seeds
in
them?
now,
you
get
away
from
the
article
by
saying,
oh,
well,
almost
all
seeds
are
roundup
these
days.
but
let's
have
some
different
commodity
where
there
are
three
or
four
different
patented
items
but
1
percent
or
2
percent
of
the
seeds
are
in
the
bin.
you
can't
--
you
can't
sell
those.
that
seems
to
me
a
very
extreme
result.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can't
sell
them
if
they
know
they
are
going
to
be
used
for
seeds,
and
you
can't
use
them
for
seeds
even
though
there
is
only
1
percent
of
the
seeds?
