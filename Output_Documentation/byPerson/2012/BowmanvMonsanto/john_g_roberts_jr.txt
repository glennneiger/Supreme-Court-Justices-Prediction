chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
11-796,
bowman
v.
monsanto
company.
mr.
walters.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
in
the
world
would
anybody
spend
any
money
to
try
to
improve
the
seed
if
as
soon
as
they
sold
the
first
one
anybody
could
grow
more
and
have
as
many
of
those
seeds
as
they
want?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
true,
that's
true
in
the
case
of
any
patented
article,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
patent
system
is
based,
i
think,
on
the
recognition
that
contractual
protection
is
inadequate
to
encourage
invention.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you
only
need
one
--
i
mean,
you
throw
the
seeds
on
the
ground,
one
or
two
of
them
are
going
to
grow
and
you
still
have
the
same
case,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
maybe
i
didn't
read
this
right.
i
thought
what
he
did
was
plant
all
the
commodity
seeds,
and
then
applied
the
roundup
so
that
all
that
was
left
was
the
roundup
ready-resistance
seeds,
and
then
he
used
those.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
come
that's
not
a
problem
the
first
time
you
plant?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
mean
the
very
first
time,
you
get
nothing
but
monsanto
ready
--
roundup
ready
seeds
and
you
plant
those.
are
you
telling
us
you
have
the
same
problem
with
them
growing
at
different
rates
and
all
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
that
doesn't
make
the
commodity
seeds
any
different?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
sherry?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean,
this
--
the
reason
it's
never
is
because
this
is
an
entirely
different
case.
it's
the
reason
it's
here,
because
you
have
the
intersection
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
and
the
--
the
normal
protection
of
reinvented
articles.
so
i
don't
think
it
gets
you
very
far
to
say
that
we've
never
applied
the
exhaustion
doctrine
that
way
either.
we
have
never
applied
the
reinvention
doctrine
to
articles
that
reinvent
themselves
like
plant
seed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
when
--
when
are
the
patent
rights
exhausted
in
the
seed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
just
so
i
can
follow
your
--
just
so
i
can
follow
your
answer,
monsanto
sells
the
seed
to
the
farmer.
and
you
are
saying
if
the
farmer
grows
the
seed
he
can
sell
it
to
anybody
he
wants,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
putting
aside
all
the
contracts
and
stuff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
sounds
like
the
patent
rights
haven't
been
exhausted
then.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
saying
it's
exhausted
with
respect
to
the
one
bean?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
always
the
case
because
it's
a
very
--
the
other
cases
haven't
involved
this
situation
where
you
are
talking
about
a
self-regenerating
product.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
haven't
had
that
case
either.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
that
how
it
works?
[laughter]
no,
i'm
serious.
i
mean,
your
example,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
quite
on
point
because
it's
not
a
situation
where
the
intended
use
of
the
vaccine
necessarily
results
in
regeneration
of
it.
in
your
hypothetical,
cvs
was
going
to
some
lab
and
making
more,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
mr.
walters,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
about
mr.
waxman's
suggestion
that
we've
already
decided
this
in
microsoft
v.
at&t?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
that
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-796,
bowman
versus
monsanto
company.
