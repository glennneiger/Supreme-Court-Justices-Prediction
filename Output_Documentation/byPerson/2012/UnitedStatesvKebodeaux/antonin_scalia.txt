justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
assume
that
applies
to
all
federal
crimes,
right?
anyone
convicted
of
any
federal
crime
can
thereafter
be
subjected
to
whatever
civil
restraints
congress
later
decides
are
--
are
a
good
idea
in
order
to
prevent
that
crime,
that
type
of
crime
from
reoccurring,
right?
i
mean,
nothing
peculiar
here
about
sex
crimes.
any
--
any
crime
congress
can
later
decide,
you
know,
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
when
--
when
a
person
has
committed,
i
don't
know,
crime
with
the
use
of
a
gun,
we
--
we
impose
retroactively
all
sorts
of
different
civil
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
that's
not
the
point,
that
it's
--
that
it's
retroactive.
the
point
is
that
it
is
not
in
execution
of
a
federal
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be
an
execution
of
a
federal
power--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
power
--
the
power
to
prevent
that
crime
and
to
punish
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
have
to
be
imposed
simultaneously
as
--
as
the
punishment
for
the
crime
of
which
the
individual
has
been
convicted.
here,
the
trial
is
over,
the
conviction
is
over,
and
then
some
years
later
the
federal
government
decides,
oh,
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
people
who
have
committed
sex
crimes
are
--
are
subjected
to
these
limitations.
that's
quite
different
from
imposing
that
simultaneously
as
--
as
a
punishment
for
the
crime.
this
is
not
a
punishment
for
the
crime,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
just
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
we
think
this
guy
probably,
you
know,
51/49,
committed
a
sex
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
just
--
just
more
--
more
likely
than
not
is
the
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
--
to
what
does
this
civil
--
civil-criminal
line
apply?
suppose
instead
of
a
registration
requirement,
congress
just
decided,
you
know,
our
past
punishments
for
sex
offenses
have
not
been
--
have
not
been
severe
enough,
and
so
we
are
now
going
to
impose
a
civil
fine
on
all
--
all
persons
who
have
been
convicted
in
federal
court
of
sex
crimes.
it's
a
civil
--
it's
a
civil
penalty,
not
a
criminal
penalty.
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
difficult
to
believe
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
whether
it's
ex
post
facto
and
impermissible
or
not
is
simply
eliminated,
that
issue
was
eliminated
by
simply
calling
it
civil.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
--
ex
post
facto.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it's
civil.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
find
that
difficult
to
grasp.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
when
--
when
you
say
that
as
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
you're
--
you're
no
longer
relying
on
--
on
the
power
to
regulate
the
military.
you're
relying
on
--
on
some
general
federal
power
to
protect
citizens
against
people
who
have
committed
any
federal
crimes.
and
i
--
i
don't
see
that
enumerated
power
in
the
constitution.
yes,
i
see
a
power
to
regulate
the
military,
but
your
description,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
regulating
the
military.
it
has
to
do
with
protecting
the
--
the
public
at
large
from
people
who
have
committed
federal
crimes,
military
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
because
it
protects
federal
functions.
the
federal
--
the
criminal
applicability
to
the
armed
forces
protects
the
function
of
regulating
the
armed
forces.
but
how
does
protecting
the
public
at
large
from
people
who
have
committed
a
crime
in
the
armed
forces,
how
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
regulating
the
armed
forces.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
though
to
--
to
distinguish
the
example
that
justice
alito
just
gave.
this
is
not
a
statute
which
only
requires
him
to
registrate
--
to
register
if
he
hangs
around
the
military
installation.
this
requires
him
to
registrate
anywhere,
you
know,
in
the
--
in
the
wilds
of
alaska
where
--
it's
just
not
this
case.
and
even
--
even
if
you
would
allow
that,
and
say
it
is
a
reasonable
--
it
has
a
reasonable
connection
to
the
power
to
regulate
the
military,
to
say
wherever
he
goes
he
has
to
register
is
--
is
a
different
question,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
never
--
we've
never
held,
have
we,
that
what
the
federal
government
can
itself
do
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
it
can
impose
upon
individuals
to
do
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause?
aren't
there
two
different
--
what
is
necessary
and
proper
for
the
federal
government
itself
to
do
is
not
necessarily
necessary
and
proper
for
the
federal
government
to
require
private
individuals
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
unusual.
when
you're
released
from
the
military,
for
example,
you're
no
longer
subject
to
--
to
congress's
jurisdiction
over
the
military.
that's
a
matter
of
timing
too,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
for
something
that
they've
done
after
they
left
the
military.
that's
a
question
of
timing.
had
they
left
the
military
when
they
committed
this
crime?
if
so,
they
can't
be
prosecuted
under
--
under
that
power
of
the
federal
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
part
of
his
sentence.
that's
part
of
the
punishment
imposed.
you
assert
that
this
is
not
part
of
the
punishment
imposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
who
knows
what
they'll
do,
right?
