justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
limit
of
that
power?
how
--
for
any
federal
conviction,
whether
it's
related
to
sex
offense
or
anything
else,
congress
could
impose
any
kind
of
registration
requirement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
it
ask
every
convicted
federal
felon
to
come
in
for
a
dna
test,
because
we
know
that
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime
are
more
likely
to
be
recidivists?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
--
what
is
the
limit?
is
it
just
safety?
it
can't
be
just
safety
of
the
public,
because
you
just
said
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
recidivist
federal
offenders,
generally.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand.
i
just
posited
a
civil
registration
for
federal
offenders
of
any
kind.
that's
not
ex
post
facto
under
your
theory,
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
i
don't
know
if
i
agree
with
that,
but
accept
--
accepting
that
hypothetical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
you
know,
that's
settled
law.
whether
it's
right
or
wrong
is
a
different
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
dreeben--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
broad
as
that
authority
is,
perhaps
i'm
going
back
to
justice
alito's
question,
which
is
if
you
put
aside
that
it's
part
of
the
punishment
because
you
say
it's
not
part
of
the
punishment,
you
want
us
not
to
look
at
it
as
punishment
because
otherwise
you'd
run
into
the
ex
post
facto
problem,
you're
saying
we
have
a
need
today.
outside
of
protecting
the
public
from
a
recidivist,
what's
the
interest?
because
that
wasn't
enough
in
comstock.
we
made
it
very
clear
that
wasn't
enough.
so
if
you
take
out
all
of
the
punishment
aspects
of
this,
which
you
should
have
done
at
the
time
he
was
sentenced
and
not
now,
what
remains
in
terms
of
the
federal
interest?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
promoted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
was
--
why
did
we
even
bother
going
through
anything
in
comstock?
if
that
stands
alone
as
a
federal
interest,
then
anything
we
do
at
any
point
with
respect
to
any
person
who's
violated
a
federal
law
would
stand
in
the
same
shoes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
could
do
whatever
civil
penalties
you
want
for
as
long
as
you
want.
we
go
back
to
my
initial
question
and
justice--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
going
back
to
--
to
a
prior
question,
are
you
challenging
--
you
didn't
on
appeal,
but
it
seems
as
if
you're
accepting
that
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
impose
this
requirement
as
part
of
a
federal
sentence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
are
you
--
if
it's
not
part
of
a
federal
sentence
but
part
of
release,
it's
not
announced
at
the
sentence
but
it's
announced
at
the
time
the
prisoner
is
put
into
supervised
release
or
release
from
jail,
do
you
think
the
government
has
the
power
to
impose
it
then?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
sorna
today
becomes
part
of
the
supervised
relief
terms.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
talking
about
sorna
today.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
talking
about
just
any
prisoner
who
has
been
in
jail
but
it's
not
made,
has
not
been
paid,
part
of
the
punishment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
don't
know
of
that
power,
but
do
you
have
a
statutory--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--all
right.
so
that
power
--
i
guess
then
what
the
government
is
saying,
as
i
understand
their
argument,
if
you
have
the
power
to
do
it
at
that
point,
why
can't
you
have
the
power
to
do
it
later?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
the
same
factors
that
compel
permission
for
the
government
to
do
it
then?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
would
you
write
this
opinion
if
you
wanted
to
protect
against
what
justice
breyer
was
concerned
about,
constricting
the
commerce
clause,
which
has
been
since
madison
more
broadly
defined
than
he
did,
or
justice
alito's
example
of
ensuring
that
you're
not
closing
off
other
things
that
can
be
done
after
someone
leaves,
that
might
be
related
to,
like
punishing
a
crime
that
you
find
out
about
afterwards.
how
would
you
write
this
opinion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
wasn't
really
helpful,
because
it
--
it
doesn't
give
us
a
limiting
principle
like
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
possible
--
that
if
you're
relying
on
just
recidivism,
congress
has
to
have
an
independent
basis,
a
power
for
the
imposition
of
--
of
criminal
or
civil
sanctions
on
someone.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
argument
is
he
was
released
on
condition
of
state
registration.
isn't
your
argument
dependent
only
on
that
there
was
no
federal
registration
requirement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
bottom
line
is
you
don't
think
the
wetterling
act
applied
to
him.
is
that
your
point?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
wetterling
act
didn't
apply
to
him;
is
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--at
all?
