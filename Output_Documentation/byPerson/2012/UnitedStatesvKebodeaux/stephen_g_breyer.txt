justice
stephen
g.

okay.
then
why
not
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
--
why
not?
i
mean,
look,
this
is
--
thomas
reed
powell
once
said,
"if
you
can
think
of
a
thing
that
is
inextricably
related
to
another
thing
without
thinking
of
the
other
thing,
then
you
have
the
legal
mind.
"
and
that
seems
to
be
this
case.
all
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
somehow
i
have
to
get
out
of
my
mind
the
ex
post
facto
part,
the
potential
violation
of
due
process
part,
the
equal
protection
part,
take
that
aside.
now
i've
got
to
just
think
about
whether
it
has,
the
congress
has
the
power
under
the
provision
that
justice
alito
said.
i'm
trying
to
do
that,
and
i've
dissented
in
other
cases
on
other
grounds.
all
right.
but
in
--
in
just
trying
to
do
that,
i
think,
well,
the
military,
suppose
they
found
a
certain
number
of
--
of
individuals,
men
or
women,
have
unfortunate
problems
in
the
military.
they
discover
there
is
a
mental
illness
problem;
the
person's
out
of
the
military.
but
the
law
says
you
can
go
and
tell
the
local
mental
health
authorities
about
this
person
even
though
he's
no
longer
there.
and
suppose
the
person
had
a
criminal
problem
in
the
military
and
was
in
prison
and
suppose
the
law
said,
you
know,
you're
the
ones
who
got
the
situation
where
he
unfortunately
got
into
that
problem,
and
you,
later
on,
can
--
can
go
and
tell
authorities
about
his
problems
so
they
can
take
appropriate
action.
now,
if
they
can
do
that,
why
can't
they
have
the
power
under
article
i
to
say
really,
you
all
have
to
register.
now,
maybe
there
are
other
things,
but
you
got
this
problem
in
the
military.
you
were
convicted
in
the
military.
you
did
it
in
the
military.
we
turned
you
loose
and
there
you
are,
and
we
want,
as
part
of
our
military
regulation,
to
be
able
to
tell
authorities
about
you
and
to
make
you
register
according
to
state
law.
now,
no
due
process
problem;
i
have
to
assume
that
away.
no
punishment,
bad
punishment
problem,
none
of
those.
but
it's
a
power,
all
right?
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
you're
leading
me,
because
i'm
not
so
worried
about
this
case,
but
where
you're
leading
me
is
down
in
commerce
clause
cases
and
all
kinds
of
other
cases,
suddenly
a
distinction
arises
that
congress
can,
in
fact,
do
all
kinds
of
things
having
federal
authorities
do
this
and
that,
but
you
couldn't
make
someone
in
a
state
--
you
know,
you
can
imagine
a
few
that
are
coming
into
my
mind
--
and
so
what
i'm
worried
about
is
following
this
distinction
into
other
areas.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
yet,
now
that's
exactly
the
problem
for
me,
because
the
--
the
wilds
of
alaska
you
think
i
think,
and
i
think
i
think,
that
--
that
sure,
if
there's
a
post
office
there
--
there's
a
post
office
there,
then
what
--
the
military
is
all
right,
they
can
mail
a
letter
to
the
--
to
be
delivered
to
the
local
doctor
to
say,
look,
he
has
a
problem.
that
seems
to
be
okay.
but
you
say
it's
not
going
to
be
okay
to
tell
him
he
has
to
go
and
make
that
registration.
at
that
point
what
you've
done
is
like
madison.
i
mean,
it's
an
interpretation
of
the
commerce
clause
that
i
think
madison
might
have
wanted,
which
is
you're
reading
a
lack
of
power
because
of
a
civil
rights
problem.
i
mean,
it's
--
the
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
really
not
the
need
because
we
have
to
assume
the
need.
the
difference
is
the
restriction
on
the
individual.
and
it's
that
part
that
i'm
suddenly
worried
about
the
commerce
clause
and
every
power
in
article
i
being
read
with
exceptions
in
the
civil
rights
area
even
though
we
have
the
amendments
to
protect
the
civil
rights
problems.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
it's
the
military
--
look,
it's
the
military
that
they
are
mostly
--
that
they're
relying
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
say
--
i
mean,
the
famous
statement
--
i
looked
it
up
--
"let
the
end
be
legitimate,
let
it
be
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution,
and
all
means
which
are
appropriate
and
not
forbidden
are
--
fall
within
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
"
all
right?
the
end
is
to
protect
the
communities
from
those
individuals
in
respect
to
those
matters
that
they
became
dangerous
with
when
they
were
in
the
military;
okay?
that's
the
end.
and
is
the
means
appropriate?
they
say
yes.
they
say,
after
all,
the
means
here
is,
notify
them
when
we're
--
you're
moving
around.
and
therefore,
is
it
forbidden?
well,
we're
not
supposed
to
consider
that
part,
but
--
so
leave
that
out.
but
the
--
the
others,
they
say
is
okay.
so
that's
the
basic.
do
you
think
maybe
we
should
send
this
back
to
the
--
to
the
fifth
circuit?
the
government
suggests
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
they
didn't
get
it
right
in
respect
to
what
the
previous
statutes
require.
what
about
all
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
to
know
what
to
do
if
i
end
up
thinking
they
are
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
recommendation
there
on
that
assumption?
i'm
not
saying
i
would,
but
i'm
just
saying
on
that
assumption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
1999
a
special
court
martial
convicted
anthony
kebodeaux,
who's
a
member
of
the
air
force
of
a
sex
offense.
in
2006,
after
he
served
his
sentence
and
had
been
discharged
from
the
air
force,
congress
enacted
a
new
law
called
sorna
to
registration
act,
which
requires
those
convicted
of
federal
sex
offenses
to
register
in
states
where
they
live,
work
or
study.
and
subsequently,
kebodeaux
failed
to
satisfy
that
law.
he
didn't
register
properly.
he
was
convicted
of
violating
sorna,
but
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
constitution
did
not
give
congress
the
power
to
apply
sorna
to
kebodeaux.
in
that
circuit's
view,
kebodeaux,
having
completed
his
sentence
and
left
the
air
force
before
the
act
was
passed,
was
henceforth,
no
different
no
different
from
any
other
person
in
america,
and
congress
could
not
enact
sorna
and
apply
to
him
simply
because
he
once
violated
the
federal
law.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit's
conclusion.
at
the
time,
kebodeaux
committed
his
crime,
and
well
before
he
was
released,
he
was
subject
to
a
different
federal
registration
law
namely,
the
wetterling
act.
that
act
imposed
civil
registration
requirements
upon
him
that
were
really
the
same
or
virtually
the
same
as
those
that
the
later-enacted
sorna
applied.
so,
congress
possessed
adequate
constitutional
authority
to
pass
wetterling
act
under
article
i,
military
regulation
and
the
broad
necessary
and
proper
clauses.
so,
when
kebodeaux
was
released,
he
was
not
the
same
as
every
other
american.
he
was
different
from
most
other
americans,
because
he
was
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
wetterling
act
and
that
difference
in
our
view,
means
that
at
a
minimum,
that
the
same
constitutional
clauses
that
gave
congress
the
power
to
continue
to
subject
kebodeaux
to
the
same
requirements
or
basically
the
same,
that
were
in
sorna.
we
explain
our
reasons
more
fully
in
our
opinion.
we
reverse
of
this
circuit's
judgment.
the
chief
justice
and
justice
alito
have
each
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
scalia
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
and
justice
thomas
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
scalia.
