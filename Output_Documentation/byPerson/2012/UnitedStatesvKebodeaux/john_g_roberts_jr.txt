chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-418,
united
states
v.
kebodeaux.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
in
comstock,
it
was
very
different
than
the
situation
here,
because
the
analysis
was
that
the
federal
government
basically
was
the
source
of
the
problem
in
incarcerating
sex
offenders
away
from
the
state
so
that
no
state
felt
an
obligation
to
do
something
with
the
problem
of
their
release.
you
don't
have
anything
of
that
sort
here.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
argument
depends
in
no
way
on
the
fact
that
he
was
convicted
of
a
federal
offense
or
--
or
incarcerated
for
that
offense,
nothing
at
all?
we're
just
here
arguing
about
the
retroactivity
under
--
whether
they
have
the
authority
under
article
i
to
impose
punishment
for
not
registering
under
state
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
if
they
can
do
that.
but
that's
not
what
they've
done
here.
your
argument,
as
you
told
me
a
while
ago,
is
linked
to
the
federal
offense
and
the
incarceration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
states
were
not
doing
anything
about
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
here
you
have
a
situation
where
i
think
at
the
time
every
state
dealt
with
the
issue
of
whether
the
sex
offenders
should
have
to
register
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
argument
based
--
your
argument
based
on
congress's
authority
with
respect
to
the
military,
your
article
i
argument,
and
you
say
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
that
he's
no
longer
in
the
military,
does
that
--
do
you
come
out
differently
if
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
is
asserted
to
be
inter
--
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
fact
that
somebody
at
some
time
in
their
life
traveled
across
state
lines
means
that
the
federal
government
can
go
back,
even
though
their
activity
that's
challenged
in
the
particular
instance
is
only
intrastate,
and
still
assert
jurisdiction
over
them?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
getting
confused
between
two
different
assertions
of
a
federal
interest.
earlier
you
talked
about
the
integrity
of
the
military
forces.
they
go
back
later,
they
think
they
should
address
the
fact
that
people
were
engaging
in
criminal
activities
when
in
the
military,
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
found
out,
they
weren't
prosecuted.
later
on
they
can
go
back.
but
then
you
say
that
the
interest
that's
at
issue
here
is
preventing
recidivism,
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
integrity
of
the
military
force.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
fuentes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
--
i'm
not
sure
that
makes
much
sense.
you're
saying
if
they're
relying
on
the
enumerated
power
with
respect
to
the
military,
they
can
do
more
than
if
they're
relying
on
the
enumerated
power
over
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
in
what
sense--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
in
what
sense
does
it
then
depend
on
which
enumerated
power
they're
invoking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
say
--
they
say
it
exists
by
virtue
of
the
enumerated
power
to
regulate
the
military
forces.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
trying
to
see
why
you're
saying
the
enumerated
power
under
the
spending
clause
allows
them
to
take
this
subsequent
action,
but
the
enumerated
power
under
the
military
clause
does
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
that
if
you're
arguing
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
that
you
need
an
enumerated
power
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
is
going
to
serve.
but
i
don't
see
how
it
makes
a
difference
which
enumerated
power
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
get
to
ask
the
questions.
you
don't.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
not
limited.
you've
limited
it
to
sex
offenses,
but
the
--
congress
could
say
it's
important
to
us
that
people
who
serve
in
the
military
behave
correctly
even
after
they're
released.
so
it
is
a
federal
offense
to
do
anything
that
violates
state
law
for
the
rest
of
their
lives,
and
your
argument
would
say,
well,
that's
part
of
their
authority
to
regulate
the
military
and
so
it's
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
congress
can
do
that.
it
can
say
anyone
in
the
military
is
subject
for
the
rest
of
their
life
to
federal
jurisdiction.
whatever
is
a
state
law
crime
is
a
federal
crime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-418
united
state
versus
kebodeaux.
