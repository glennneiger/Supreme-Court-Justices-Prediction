the
discussion
so
far
has
assumed,
your
discussion
primarily,
that
there's
this
line
between
civil
and
criminal,
we
don't
need
to
worry
about
ex
post
facto.
is
that
line
made
clear
in
our
precedents
or
is
there
some
room
to
argue
that
if
the
line
is
somewhat
blurred
that
there
may
be
ex
post
facto
concerns
here
and
that
that
in
turn
is
a
reason
for
constitutional
avoidance
when
we
evaluate
your
argument?
is
that
--
is
the
civil
--
a
criminal
distinction
with
reference
to
ex
post
facto
clause
absolutely
foreclosed
and
clear
in
the
facts
of
this
case?
