mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
convicted
sex
offenders
pose
a
serious
threat
to
public
safety.
when
those
convictions
are
entered
under
federal
law,
congress
has
the
authority
to
impose
both
a
criminal
and
a
civil
sanction
for
that
conduct
in
order
to
protect
the
public.
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
applied
a
per
se
rule
that
once
respondent
had
completed
his
military
sentence,
congress
lost
authority
to
apply
a
civil
sanction
for
that
violation
of
federal
law.
that
per
se
rule
is
wrong.
nothing
in
article
i
prevents
congress
from
legislating
retroactively
with
respect
to
civil
remedies
for
past
violations
of
federal
law.
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
the
due
process
clause,
and
article
i
analysis
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
all
provide
some
degree
of
protection
against
retroactive
provisions,
but
no
per
se
rule
bars
congress
from
applying
sex
offender
registration
requirements,
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
civil
remedies
not
barred
by
the
ex
post
facto
clause
to
past
federal
criminal
convictions.
now--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
certainly,
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
there
are
independent
constitutional
limits
both
outside
of
article
i
and
within
article
i
that
mean
that
i
will
answer
your
question
no,
it's
not
the
case
that
my
position
today
means
there
are
no
limits.
there
are
limits.
if
we--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
--
the
principal
limitation
on
retroactive
legislation
is
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
indeed,
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
an
ex
post
facto
clause
if
the
fifth
circuit
were
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
so
if
--
if
the
court
agrees
that
it's
not
a
punitive
measure
and
it
is
a
remedial
measure--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
if
you
don't
agree
with
it,
then
you'll
be
going
on
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
and
you
won't
be
getting
to
article
i.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
settled
law,
and
that
means
that
sex
offender
registration
provisions
aren't
punitive.
the
question
here
is,
are
they
within
article
i.
and
the
court
in
united
states
v.
comstock
went
through
an
elaborate
necessary
and
proper
clause
analysis--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
this
provision,
mr.
chief
justice,
rests
on
a
different
analysis
than
comstock.
in
comstock,
the
problem
was
caused
by
federal
custody
that,
as
your
honor
has
said,
broke
the
relationship
between
the
individual
and
some
state
that
might
take
cognizance
of
him
for
purposes
of
sex
offender
civil
commitment.
the
basis
for
the
statute
in
comstock
was
that
people
in
federal
custody,
regardless
of
the
nature
of
their
prior
convictions,
might
pose
threats
if
released.
the
basis
for
the
statute
in
this
case
is
not
that
the
individual
was
in
federal
custody.
federal
custody
is
irrelevant
to
it.
the
basis
for
the
statute
in
this
case
is
that
this
is
a
sex
offender
in
violation
of
federal
law,
and
congress
has
the
authority
to
impose,
as
was
done
in
this
case,
criminal
punishment,
but
it
also
has
the
authority
to
impose
civil
regulatory
sanctions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
scalia,
there
is
no
per
se
rule
in
article
i
that
forbids
retroactive
civil
regulations
imposed
on
a
federal
offender.
so
the
question--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
the
whole
point
in
this
case
is
that
it's
retroactive,
because
there
isn't
any
serious
dispute
that
if
somebody
commits
a
federal
sex
offense
they
can
be
placed
on
supervised
release
for
life
so--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
so
is
this.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
but
congress's
power
is
not
limited
to
preventing
and
punishing
crimes
through
criminal
law.
except
for
a
brief
interlude
under
united
states
v.
halper
where
this
court
viewed
double
jeopardy
as
precluding
multiple
criminal
and
civil
sanctions,
the
court
has
recognized
that
when
someone
violates
federal
law
they're
exposed
both
to
criminal
punishment
and
to
civil
sanctions.
the
criminal
punishment
has
to
comply
with
the
ex
post
facto
clause;
the
civil
sanctions
do
not.
so
what
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
precisely--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--what
makes
it
a
civil
sanction.
but,
justice
scalia,
your
honor
is
presupposing
that
congress
can
only
react
to
a
sex
crime
through
the
criminal
law
and
that
it
must
have
those
laws
in
place
at
the
time
of
the
punishment,
and
there
is
no
such
article
i
precept.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
this
case
turns
entirely
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
a
federal
offender.
the
source
of
power
in
question
was
the
power
to
regulate
the
armed
forces.
this
is
an
individual
who
committed
a
sex
crime
while
in
the
armed
forces.
and
congress's
power
to
address
that
and
to
prescribe
remedies
for
it
both
civil
and
criminal
is
entirely
tied
to
the
federal
nature
of
the
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
alito,
i
think
the
most
helpful
way
to
do
that
would
be
for
me
to
progress
through
a
series
of
examples
that
illustrate
how
protecting
the
public
against
a
federal
sex
offender
is
a
legitimate
aim
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
implement
the
underlying
constitutional
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
so
start
with
a
sex
offender
who
commits
a
sex
offense
in
the
military,
is
tried,
court-martialed
and
sentenced.
subject
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
limitations,
due
process
limitations,
et
cetera,
that
individual
can
be
incarcerated,
placed
on
supervised
release
potentially
up
to
life.
a
condition
of
supervised
release,
well-recognized
and
now
mandated
by
federal
law,
is
that
that
individual
register
as
a
sex
offender.
and
the
reason
that
that
is
tied
to
federal
law
is
that
when
an
individual
violates
federal
law
it
is
a
legitimate
purpose
of
congress
to
protect
the
public
against
recidivism
by
that
individual.
so
that's
the
criminal
example
that
i
believe
is
undisputed.
now,
suppose
that
the
federal
government
didn't
actually
get
the
sex
offender
while
he
was
in
the
military.
it
missed
the
crime,
but
later
information
comes
to
light
still
within
the
statute
of
limitations
that
shows
that
while
this
person
was
in
the
military
they
committed
a
sex
offense.
this
court
in
united
states
ex
rel.
toth
v.
quarles
made
clear
that
that
individual
can
be
tried
in
an
article
iii
court
for
his
criminal
violation
even
though
he's
out
of
the
military.
it's
enforcing
the
rules
that
were
impressed
upon
him
at
the
time
while
he
was
in
the
military.
now
let
me
give
a
civil
example
and
then
i
will
bring
it
right
back
to
this
case.
suppose
that
congress
concludes
that
sex
offenses
in
the
military
are
a
very
serious
problem
and
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
have
escaped
prosecution
because
of
lax
interest
in
pursuing
those
crimes.
and
after
a
period
of
years,
it
sets
up
a
board
of
inquiry
and
it
says
this
board
of
inquiry
is
going
to
look
into
sex
offenses
that
were
committed
at
the
time
that
people
were
in
the
military,
even
if
they're
out
of
the
military,
and
we're
going
to
subpoena
people
to
testify,
and
if
individuals
are
determined
in
a
civil
proceeding
to
have
committed
sex
offenses
they
may
have
their
military
records
revised,
they
may
lose
military
benefits,
and
they
may
have
other
civil
sanctions
imposed
upon
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
noncriminal.
noncriminal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
going
to
be
a
criminal
punishment
that's
imposed
at
the
end
of
the
day.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
an
acceptable
level
of
proof
for
the
civil
law.
and
if
congress
can
do
that
in
order
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
military
and
to
promote
confidence
in
the
military,
then
it's
a
very
small
step,
if
any
step
at
all,
to
sorna.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
absolute
--
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
not
linked
to
the
incarceration.
this
is
the
difference
between
this
case
and
comstock,
and
this
is
why
the
solicitor
general's
concession
in
comstock
on
which
the
fifth
circuit
heavily
relied
has
no
applicability
here.
in
comstock,
it
was
irrelevant
what
offense
the
individual
had
been
committed.
the
problem
was
he
was
in
federal
custody,
he
was
sexually
dangerous
at
the
time
he
would
be
released.
ties
had
been
broken
between
him
and
the
community,
and
if
he
were
released
it
would
pose
a
threat
to
public
safety
that
the
federal
government
had
power
to
protect
against.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
but
federal
law
did
as
well
and
federal
law
provided
encouragement.
this
is
actually
a
primary
example
of
partnership
between
state
governments
and
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
offers
financial
support,
it
offers
logistical
assistance,
it
offers
tremendous
resources
of
the
u.s.
marshals
to
track
down
sex
offenders.
and
as
this
court
said
in
carr
v.
united
states,
it
was
entirely
reasonable
for
congress
to
have
assigned
a
special
responsibility
for
prosecuting
federal
sex
offenders
who
failed
to
register.
this
was
integral
to
this
court's
reasoning
in
carr,
where
the
court
was
confronted
with
two
provisions
of
2250,
the
criminal
sex
offense
provision
under
sorna.
for
state
offenders,
there
had
to
be
travel
in
interstate
commerce;
for
federal
offenders
there
didn't.
the
government
argued
that
the
provisions
ought
to
be
given
as
co-extensive
a
reach
as
possible
so
that
the
coverage
of
the
statute
would
be
equally
comprehensive
for
both
state
and
federal.
and
this
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
it
is,
i
believe,
justice
kennedy.
in
an
opinion
that
you
wrote
for
the
court,
smith
v.
doe,
which
considered
the
retroactivity
of
alaska's
sex
offender
registration
and
notification
provisions,
which
are
similar
but
not
identical,
to
the
federal
provisions,
the
court
went
through
the
established
analysis
to
determine
whether
the
legislature
had
intended
a
punitive
effect
and
if
it
didn't,
whether
there
was
the
clearest
proof
that
it
was
punishment
in
purpose
and
effect.
notwithstanding
the
legislature's
intent,
the
court
upheld
the
retroactive
applicability
of
sex
offender
registration
and
notification,
making
clear
that
it
is
not
governed
by
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
now,
that's
not
to
say
that
an
individual
couldn't
argue
that
sorna
is
different
or
an
individual
couldn't
argue
that
the
due
process
clause
makes
it
either
irrational
or
substantively
off
limits
to
impose
this
kind
of
civil
remedy.
the
individual
can
also
argue
that
running
this
through
the
comstock
factors,
it's
not
reasonably
adapted
to
fulfilling
congress's
aim.
but
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
is
apply
a
per
se
rule
that
it
drew,
i
think,
from
the
solicitor
general's
statement
in
comstock
that
once
an
individual
got
out
of
custody
and
was
back
in
the
control
of
the
state
and
within
its
jurisdiction
and
population,
then
the
federal
government
couldn't
reach
out
and
commit
him
as
a
sex
offender.
and
there
are
two
main
distinctions
between
that
concession
and
this
case.
the
first
is,
as
i've
already
alluded
to,
the
government's
argument
in
comstock
was
based
on
custody.
this
case
is
based
on
the
consequences
of
the
conviction
itself.
the
second
distinction
is
that
committing
somebody
civilly
is
a
massive
intrusion
on
that
individual's
relationship
with
the
state.
the
individual
has
been
brought
within
federal
custody;
they
have
no
relationship
with
the
state
anymore.
whereas
sex
offender
notification
is
far
more
accommodating
of
state
interests.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
not
per
se
barred
by
article
i,
justice
scalia.
the
question
of
whether
it's
constitutional
is
really
a
question
of
individual
rights
analysis
and
whether
it
passes
through
the
necessary
and
proper
gate
under
the
considerations
similar
to
what
the
court
looked
at
in
comstock.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there's
no--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it's
not
eliminated.
it
still
is
available
for
an
individual
to
argue,
as
respondent
did
in
this
case
in
the
district
court
but
abandoned
long
before
he
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
it
violates
due
process,
that
it
violates
ex
post
facto.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
he
can
argue
that.
i
submit
that
he
will
lose.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
if
it
in
fact
is
civil
and
passes
through
this
court's
analysis,
then
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
actually
quite
well
established
as
a
principle
of
double
jeopardy
law
in
cases
like
hudson
v.
united
states
and
united
states
v.
ursery.
it's
established
in
ex
post
facto
law
as
a
consequence
of
smith
v.
doe.
it's
the
foundation
for
deciding
whether
a
proceeding
requires
preponderance
of
the
evidence
versus
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
of
doubt.
the
court
has
articulated
this
line
in
a
variety
of
contexts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
as
long--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
that
would
probably
fail
a
necessary
and
proper
clause
analysis,
in
which
there
has
to
be
a
showing
that
the
measure
is
plainly
adapted
to
furthering
the
underlying
power.
this
is
not
a
difficult
problem
that
the
court
has
never
confronted
before.
it
has
resulted
in
difficult
permutations
on
particular
facts,
but
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
there
is
broad
necessary
and
proper
clause
authority
subject
to
limits.
those
limits--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
sotomayor--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--there
is
a
sufficient
federal
interest
in
protecting
the
public
from
someone
who
committed
a
federal
crime.
supervised
release
essentially
performs
that
function.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
a
valid--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
sotomayor,
really,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
the
same.
the
answer
to
all
of
your
questions
is
the
same,
which
is
that
there
is
an
analysis
that
the
court
went
through
in
comstock
where
it
took
into
consideration
history,
it
took
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
fit
between
the
purpose
of
congress
and
the
activity
that
it
was
regulated.
it
took
into
account
the
degree
to
which
the
state
interests
were
accommodated,
and
it
took
into
account
the
degree
of
attenuation
between
the
regulation
and
the
underlying
offense.
and
it
--
it
didn't
open
up
congress
to
say
any
offense
you've
ever
committed
means
congress
owns
you
for
life,
it
can
do
whatever
you
want.
it
has
to
pass
through
an
analysis.
but
the
fifth
circuit
never
conducted
that
analysis
except
for
believing
that
once
the
individual
had
completed
military
service,
once
the
individual
had
completed
his
criminal
sentence,
congress
lost
all
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
does
because
when
the
criminal
law
finds
someone
who
has
violated
federal
law,
many
of
the
purposes
of
the
sanctions
that
are
imposed
on
that
individual
are
public
protection
purposes
and
anti-recidivism
purposes.
most
of
the
things
that
are
done
on
supervised
release
fulfill
those
purposes.
if
those
purposes
were
not
validly
connected
to
taking
someone
who's
violated
criminal
law
and
imposing
a
suite
of
sanctions
on
them,
then
supervised
release
would
apparently
be
beyond
congress's
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
numerous
times,
including
in
comstock,
there
is
very
little
authority
in
the
constitution
in
an
enumerated
way
for
criminal
law
at
all.
all
of
criminal
law,
with
the
exception
of
a
handful
of
instances
that
are
specified
in
the
constitution,
comes
in
by
virtue
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
inherent
in
taking
somebody
who
violated
federal
law
and
imposing
appropriate
sanctions
on
them
for
that
violation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
look
essentially
the
same,
justice
kagan.
somebody
who
violates
a
federal
law
that's
premised
on
the
commerce
clause,
say
a
sex
offender
who
travels
in
interstate
commerce
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
sex
offense,
has
placed
himself
within
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
federal
government.
now,
that
individual
can
be
criminally
prosecuted
for
that
violation,
and
that
violation
furthers
congress's
interests
in
regulating
interstate
commerce.
congress
could
also
decide,
you
know,
for
some
of
these
sex
offenders,
criminal
punishment
is
not
the
right
approach.
the
right
approach
is
mandate
sex
offender
rehabilitative
counseling.
and
it
might
discover
that
that's
so
effective
for
a
class
of
offenders
that
it's
going
to
apply
that
even
to
people
whose
offenses
were
committed
before
the
law
in
question
is
passed.
it
can't
punish
those
people
based
on
retroactive
legislation,
but
it
can
reach
them
with
a
civil
remedial
measure
so
long
as
it
passes
through
the
comstock-type
analysis
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
on
that
too.
as
we
describe
in
our
brief,
title
42
section
14072(i)(3)
and
(4)
did,
in
our
view,
impose
criminal
punishment
on
respondent
for
failing
to
register
as
a
sex
offender
at
the
time
he
was
in
the
military.
we
think
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
on
that
statutory
analysis,
but,
more
fundamentally,
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
in
thinking
that
it
mattered
whether
he
was
under
some
sort
of
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
at
the
time
that
he
was
released
from
federal
custody.
and
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
i
understand
respondent's
argument,
respondent
concedes
that
he
could
have
been
put
under
a
lifetime
requirement
to
register
with
state
authorities
and
punished
federally
if
he
did
not,
if
only
that
requirement
had
been
imposed
on
him
either
at
the
time
of
sentencing
or
in
a
parallel
civil
proceeding
that
occurred
while
he
was
in
the
military.
this
case,
therefore,
reduces
to
a
question
of
timing.
the
essential
argument
that
respondent
is
making
is
that
congress
had
its
--
had
its
authority
expire
because
it
didn't
exercise
it.
there's
some
sort
of
notion
that
congress
must
speak
now
or
forever
hold
its
peace.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that's
just
wrong,
justice
scalia,
because
this
court
made
clear
in
united
states
ex
rel
toth
v.
quarles
that
if
an
individual
has
left
the
military
but
hasn't
been
prosecuted,
they
can't
be
court-martialed,
but
they
can
be
prosecuted
in
an
article
iii
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
sex
offender
registration
is
a
consequence
of
the
military
crime.
that
was
committed
while
they
were
in
the
military.
it's
a
civil
remedy
that
may,
consistent
with
other
constitutional
provisions,
be
imposed
retroactively.
and
this
case
comes
down
not
to
whether
any
member
of
the
court
agrees
with
the
ex
post
facto
doctrine
analysis
in
smith
v.
doe
or
whether
there
might
be
due
process
or
other
concerns
out
there,
it
comes
down
to
whether
congress
has
article
i
authority
to
say--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--let
me
make
two
points
about
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
a
standard
condition
of
federal
supervised
release
is
that
the
individual
shall
not
violate
any
federal,
state
or
local
law,
and
for
many
sex
offenders,
supervised
release
runs
for
life.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
see
any
relevance
that
has
to
article
i
authority;
it
has
relevance
to
other
constitutional
provisions.
so,
insofar
as
supervised
release
does
contemplate
this
longstanding,
continuous
jurisdiction,
that's
a
feature
of
federal
law
that
the
court
ought
to
keep
in
mind
in
the
way
that
it
writes
this
opinion.
but
second,
if
congress
passed
such
a
law,
it's
not
that
it
has
carte
blanche
to
do
that,
it's
just
that
there's
no
per
se
rule
that
says
it
can't.
the
court
would--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
going
to
say
no
to
that
question,
because
i
don't
want
to
foreclose
options
that
congress
may
decide
it's
appropriate
to
pass,
but
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
the
court
does
not
have
to
agree
that
that
is
constitutional
--
may
i
complete
my
sentence?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
order
to
uphold
this
narrowly
focused,
tailored
law
that
looks
at
a
specific
crime
and
imposes
a
specific
requirement
that's
directly
tied
to
the
nature
of
that
crime.
