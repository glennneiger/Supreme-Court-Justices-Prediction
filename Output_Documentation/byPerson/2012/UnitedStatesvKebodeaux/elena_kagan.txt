mr.
dreeben,
it
would
help
me
in
answering
some
of
these
questions
if
you
went
through
the
analysis
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
instead
a
commerce
clause
case.
so
take
the
military
out
of
it;
what
would
the
necessary
and
proper
analysis
look
like?
justice
elena
kagan
how
about
if
he
is
on
supervised
release?
he
is
not
in
the
military,
but
his
entire
sentence
has
not
been
completed.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess,
ms.
fuentes,
what
i
don't
quite
understand
about
the
argument,
this
goes
back
to
justice
alito's
original
question.
you
seem
to
say
that
if
this
--
if
congress
passed
a
civil
statute
like
this
one
within
the
time
that
mr.
kebodeaux
was
in
custody
or
within
the
time
that
he
was
under
supervised
release,
that
that
would
be
appropriate.
but
i
guess
what
i
don't
get
is
why
the
federal
interests
change,
whether
it's
the
day
before
he
gets
out
of
supervised
release
or
the
day
after
he
gets
out
of
supervised
release.
what
in
the
federal
interests
shift
based
on
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
wasn't
assuming
that
he
was
in
the
military
while
he
was
on
supervised
release.
justice
elena
kagan
i
was
assuming
that
he
was
out
of
the
military
in
both
these
cases,
but
that
you
said
while
he
was
still
serving
his
sentence,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
congress
to
add
this
additional
thing,
but
not
after.
justice
elena
kagan
in
both
cases,
he's
not
in
the
military
anymore.
justice
elena
kagan
i
--
i
guess
what
i'm
not
understanding,
ms.
fuentes,
is
--
i
understand
the
difference
between
a
requirement
of
registration
and
a
penalty
for
failing
to
register,
but
it's
a
little
bit
cutting
--
slicing
the
baloney
thin.
and
if
you
think
that
he
was
in
any
event
while
he
was
undergoing
his
sentence
subject
to
a
penalty,
it's
a
pretty
minor
exercise
of
federal
power,
isn't
it,
to
say
that,
instead
of
making
you
just
subject
to
a
penalty
for
doing
something,
we're
going
to
tell
you,
you
have
to
do
it?
