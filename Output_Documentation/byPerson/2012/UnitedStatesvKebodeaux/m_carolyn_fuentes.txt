ms.
m.
carolyn

yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
asks
this
court
to
go
beyond
its
holding
in
united
states
v.
comstock
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
reach
back,
after
a
federal
sentence
has
expired,
to
bring
back
into
federal
control
a
person
who
has
returned
to
the
authority
of
the
state.
and
i'm
quite
surprised
to
hear
the
government
say
that
this
is
not
a
comstock
analysis.
i'm
not
sure
they
stuck
with
that
throughout
the
argument,
but
i
think
the
comstock
factors
are
factors
that
this
court
looks
at
quite
frequently
in
doing
any
kind
of
a
necessary
and
proper
analysis.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
that's
correct.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
in
this
case,
on
these
facts
and
based
on
the
federal
statutes
that
exist
today,
the
answer
is
yes.
and
the
illustration,
i
think,
is
the
way
that
sorna
works
today.
as
the
government
mentioned--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--correct.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
okay.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
the
law
permits
a
sentencing
judge
--
i'm
not
talking
about
congress,
but
a
sentencing
judge
--
to
go
back
and
impose
additional
conditions
of
supervised
release.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
it's
18
--
18
united
states
code
section
3583.
and
3583
permits
the
sentencing
judge
to
change
conditions
of
supervised
release
based
on
the
factors
that
are
considered
important
in
sentencing
in
18
united
states
code
section
3583.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
well--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--it's
because
the
way
the
statute
works,
even
though
it
wasn't
announced
at
sentence,
supervised
release
is
considered
to
be
part
of
the
sentence.
so
if
i
understand
the
question
correctly,
the
reason
the
court
can
go
back
and
impose
those
conditions
and
possibly
the
reason
that
congress
can
go
back
and
do
it
is
because
those
statutes
that
i've
mentioned,
3583
and
3553,
have
given
notice
to
the
individual.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
that's
all
right.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
it's
all
right.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
not,
but
i
want
to
qualify
that
because
it
depends
on
what
powers
congress
is
relying
on.
and
let
me
give
an
example.
i
know
the
government
was
--
a
lot
of
the
government's
argument
relies
on
this
difference
between
criminal
and
civil
consequences.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
it
does
if
the
person
is
still
in
the
military
or
if
he
has
been
--
or
if
he
has
committed
a
criminal
offense
and
the
prosecutorial
power,
the
federal
power
to
prosecute
him
for
that
offense,
has
not
been
exhausted,
yes,
that
can
be
done.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
if
he
is
still
being
supervised
by
the
military,
then
i
think
it's
likely
that
power
exists.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
because
mr.
kebodeaux
was
not
on
supervised
release.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
yes,
but--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well,
the
power
can't
go
to
both
of
the
examples
that
you've
given.
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
them
giving
notice.
that
does
not
impose
a
federal
obligation
on
an
individual.
so
there
is
no
power
being
exerted
on
the
individual.
they
can
have
a
public
--
a
public
protection
purpose
and
they
can
tell
--
tell
authorities
who
need
to
deal
with
the
individual,
and
those
authorities
may
have
the
power
through
state
power--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
don't
think
that
is
a
problem,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
i
disagree
fundamentally
with
the
government.
i
think
necessary
and
proper
analysis
is
important
in
each
case
and
it
does
bear
similarities
in
each
case.
but
depending
on
the
power
being
relied
upon,
the
analysis
can
be
quite
different.
commerce
clause
is
a
very
broad
power.
i
can't
say
whether
this
sort
of
thing,
depending
on
the
commerce
clause,
would
be
right
or
would
be
wrong.
look
at
the
power
to
make
a
uniform
rule
of
naturalization.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
well,
i
think
while
that
person
is
still
within
the
criminal
jurisdiction,
or
any
federal
jurisdiction,
it
could
be
done.
i
think
that
once
that
jurisdiction
has
been
exhausted,
once
the
criminal
prosecution
power
has
been
exhausted,
once
the
person
has
returned
to
the
authority
of
the
state,
and
i
think
that
analysis
is
important
always.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
it
may
well
be.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
haven't
thought
of
it
that
way
and
that
really
isn't
the
argument
that
i'm
making.
i
think
that
the
military
has
jurisdiction.
it's
gotten
information
about
this
individual
when
it
had
power
over
him
and
they
can
talk
to
whomever
they
care
to
about
him,
or
whether--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
absolutely
agree
with
that.
and
i
think
that
this
goes
back
to
something
that
the
government
--
well,
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
address
something
the
government
has
said
about
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion.
that
it
is
a
per
se
rule,
and
that
is
just
incorrect.
i
--
i
have
to
disagree
with
that.
and
i
have
to
disagree
with
it
because
the
--
everything
the
fifth
circuit
said
was
limited
by
these
facts.
these
facts
are
what
controls
the
case.
and
the
fifth
circuit
took
great
care
to
make
a
very
narrow
ruling.
and
that
ruling,
the
fifth
circuit
said,
is
that
it's
unconstitutional,
sorna's
requirements,
as
applied
to
mr.
kebodeaux
and
others
like
him.
it
has
no
effect
on
congress's
ability
to
impose
conditions
on
a
prisoner's
release
from
custody
or
on
congress's
ability
to
effect
the
registration
requirements
for
anyone
who
has
been
convicted
after
sorna's
enactment.
so
really,
it
is
not
a
per
se
rule.
it
is
a
rule,
maybe
you
call
it
per
se
as
it
--
as
it
affects
people
in
mr.
kebodeaux's
position,
but
i
think
that
is
very
different
from
what
the
government
is
arguing.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i'll
answer
that
question
first,
then
come
back
to
another.
it's
not
a
question,
i
don't
think,
of
federal
interest.
it's
a
question
of
federal
power.
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
individual
power
being
exercised.
and
so
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
what's
the
difference
if
the
federal
government
makes
a
rule
for
a
person
in
the
military
before
--
when
he's
in
the
military
or
after
he
gets
out
of
the
military?
that's
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
in
--
in
--
that's
our
argument.
that
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--constitutionally,
it
--
it
can
be
all
right
constitutionally,
depending
on
the
statutory
procedures
that
govern
it.
and
the
way
that
the
federal
law
operates
now,
the
statutes
that
i
mentioned,
3583
and
3553,
the
way
those
statutes
--
statutes
operate
is
they
--
they
give
someone
notice
that
their
conditions
of
supervised
release
can
be
--
can
be
changed.
and
so
there
isn't
an
ex
post
facto
problem
with
that.
and
there
isn't
a
power
problem
with
that,
because
the
criminal
--
the
power
to
make
the
criminal
offense
and
punish
it
still
exists
while
that
person
is
on
supervised
release.
it
has
expired
with
respect
to
mr.
kebodeaux,
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
most
important
points
in
this
case,
and
it
goes
along
with
the
comstock
analysis.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no.
after
the
criminal
sentence
is
served.
i'm
sorry.
maybe
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
right.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
not
if
--
not
unless
it
was
--
that
provision
was
imposed
as
part
of
the
sentence
or
while
he
was
still
within
the
federal
power,
before
the
federal
criminal
jurisdiction
expires.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
well,
i'm
not
sure--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--yes.
i'm
not
sure
i'm
answering
the
question
correctly,
but
that
power
doesn't
last
forever.
the
powers
--
there
are
some
powers
in
the
constitution
which
may
last
longer
than
others,
and
the
example
i
raised
before
was
the
rule
of
making
uniform
naturalization.
that's
a
broader
power,
i
think,
than
the
military
power.
and
we
see
that
in
the
cases
the
government's
mentioned
and
we've
mentioned,
the
toth
case
and
the
kinsella
case.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no.
no,
i'm
not
making
that
argument.
and
again,
it
goes
to
the
individual
facts
and
the
power
asserted
and
the
way
the
power
operates
always
makes
a
difference.
the
example
that
the
government
gave
with
that
board
of
inquiry
and
being
able
to
bring
people
back
in,
i
find
that
whole
scenario
very
questionable.
but
there
--
there
were
people
who
were
--
were
receiving
military
benefits,
if
i
understood
it.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
just
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
did
in
its
en
banc
opinion.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i'm
not
certain
an
opinion
like
that
could
be
written.
i
think
that
the
limits,
the
limitations
that
exist,
are
on
the
narrowness
of
the
way
the
opinion
is
written.
but
future
cases
i
don't
think
can
be
decided
that
way.
certainly,
principles
can
be
articulated
which
help
to
limit.
and
i
think
the
--
the
best
you
can
say
in
terms
of
limiting
principles
is
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
enumerated
power
upon
which
the
government
relies
to
impose
this
obligation.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no.
and
if
that's
your
understanding--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
--
i
apologize.
i
did
not
mean
that.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
well,
let
--
let
me
give
an
example
that
goes
to
the
collateral
consequence
cases
that
the
government
raised.
the
government
raises,
for
example,
the
hudson
case,
where
a
person
who
is
convicted
of
bank
fraud
both
can
be
punished
criminally
and
then
can
be
debarred
civilly
from
participating
any
more
with
federal
government
contracts.
i
think
the
words
that
were
used
in
the
hudson
case
were
"no
longer
may
have
business
doings
with
an
insured
bank.
"
okay,
that
has
to
be,
i
think,
the
spending
power.
the
government
can
decide
with
whom
it
wants
to
do
business.
if
it's
dealing
with
an
insured
bank,
then
it
can
impose
that
civil
consequence.
and
it
can
do
it
--
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
“
independently
”
of.
they
may
do
it
by
reason
of
the
criminal
conviction,
but
there
is
an
independent
power
to
do
it.
that
power
doesn't
exist
here,
and
so
it
would
have
to
be--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well,
i
don't
think
it
does.
perhaps
i
don't
understand
the--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well,
because
the
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
think
it
all
--
i
think
it
does
turn
on
the
nature
of
the
power.
i
mean,
could
you
use
the
military
power
to
say
you,
mr.
bank
fraud
client,
cannot
contract
with
the
government
any
more?
no.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
sorry.
you
are
so
correct
on
that.
i
apologize.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
yes.
and
it--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--well,
the
fifth
circuit
did
get
it
right
with
respect
to
the
previous
statute.
and
the
reason
that
the
government
wants
to
send
it
back
is
because
they
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
relied
on
the
fact
that
mr.
kebodeaux
was
unconditionally
released.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
unconditionally
released.
but
they
equate
unconditional
release
with
release
free
from
a
registration
requirement.
we
have
gone
over
that
in
great
length
in
our
brief.
the
government
is
simply
wrong
about
that,
for
the
reasons
that
we
state
in
our
brief.
and
i
can
go
into
those,
if
you
want,
if
you'd
like.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
yes.
they
are--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--i
--
i
guess
it
depends
on
which
assumption.
the
fifth
circuit
would
not
have
changed
its
opinion
in
this
case
because
mr.
kebodeaux,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
the
government
agrees
or
not,
was
not
released
on
condition
that
he
comply
with
sex
offender
registration
requirements.
you
can
see
the
difference
between
mr.
kebodeaux's
release
and
the
release
of
a
person
who
is
released
on
conditions
that
he
comply
with
requirements,
and
that
is
in
35--
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
--no.
it
is
dependent
on
whether
that
release
was
conditioned
on
his
registration,
and
it
wasn't.
today,
when
a
person
is
released
from
custody
on
supervised
release,
it
is
a
condition
of
that
release
under
3583
that
he
comply
with
sex
offender
registration
requirements.
what
happens
if
he
doesn't
comply?
he
can
go
back
to
prison
on
the
original
conviction,
because
he
was
released
on
condition
that
he
comply
with
federal
sex
offender
requirements.
it
just
goes
to
--
to
the
judge.
it's
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
kebodeaux
was
released,
not
on
any
conditions.
now,
the
state
may
have
imposed
an
independent
obligation
to
register,
but
that
was
not
a
condition
of
his
release.
and
so
it
is
not
the
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
he
was
released
on
condition.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i'm
sorry?
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
no.
i
don't
think
the
wetterling
act
applied
to
him.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
correct.
but
even
if
it
did,
it
was
--
it's
far
removed
from
a
registration
requirement.
it
is
a
penalty,
not
a
registration
requirement.
the
state
imposed
a
registration
requirement.
wetterling
did
not.
and
if
you'd
just
read
--
and
i
think
that's
what
the
fifth
circuit
did.
they
just
read
the
statute,
14072(i)(3)
and
(i)(4).
it
doesn't
say
a
person
who
is
required
to
register
will
follow
--
will
suffer
the
following
punishment.
it
says
a
person
described
in
4042(d),
a
person
who's
been
into
a
court-martial.
if
you
look
at
the
rest
of
14072
and
parts
of
14071,
there
are
provisions
that
say
such
and
such
person
shall
register.
that
is
a
registration
requirement.
ms.
m.
carolyn
fuentes
i
guess
i
don't.
and
the
reason
is
it's
not
the
degree
of
power
exerted,
it's
whether
the
power
exists.
and
once
mr.
kebodeaux
completed
his
federal
sentence,
the
military
power,
which
permitted
him
to
be
prosecuted
and
punished,
had
expired.
and
so
in
some
ways
it's
like
there's
federal
enclave
jurisdiction
on
this
side
of
the
street
where
the
base
exists,
where
the
navy
yard
exists,
and
things
that
happened
here
can
be
punished
by
the
federal
government,
but
just
across
the
street
the
exact
same
things
can
occur
and
the
federal
government
cannot
punish
it.
so
i
think
it
is
very
careful
to
draw
those
fine
lines,
and
i
think
it
is
essential
when
discussing
issues
of
the
enumerated
powers,
because
they
are
limited.
i
don't
mean
to
move
on
fast.
i
did
want
to
mention
--
i
know
my
time
is
almost
up
--
that
we
have
offered
an
alternative
ground
for
deciding
the
constitutional
questions
here:
the
effective
date
argument.
i
know
we
didn't
raise
it
in
the
fifth
circuit,
but
this
court
has
the
authority
to
consider
it,
and
we
have
put
into
our
brief
all
the
reasons
that
mr.
kebodeaux
is
not
covered
by
sorna
to
begin
with.
in
the
sixth,
ninth
and
third
circuits,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
sorna,
and
so
that
is
an
alternative
basis
that
i
think
the
court
can
decide
this
case
on.
and
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
cede
the
rest
of
my
time.
