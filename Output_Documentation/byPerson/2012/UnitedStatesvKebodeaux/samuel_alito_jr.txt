justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we
start
out
with
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
make
rules
to
regulate
the
military
and
we
end
up
with
a
registration
requirement
that
applies
to
someone
who's
not
in
the
military
and
perhaps
is
not
even
living
anywhere
near
any
military
installation.
so
what
would
be
helpful
for
me
is
to
start
out
with
the
constitutional
provision,
identify
a
purpose
of
that
that
is
served
by
this
civil
registration
that
is
imposed
later,
and
trace
this
whole
progress
through
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you
say
in
a
civil
proceeding,
you
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
are
not
talking
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
your
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we're
not
talking
about
statutory
authorization.
we
are
talking
about
constitutional
power.
so
if
we
start
out
with
the
example
of
registration
for
life
being
imposed
as
part
of
supervised
release,
part
of
the
criminal
sentence,
then
we
go
to
an
example
where
it
is
not
part
of
the
criminal
sentence
but
it
is
a
civil
requirement
triggered
by
a
separate
civil
proceeding
for
every
federal
--
every
person
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
under
federal
law.
now,
if
that
were
the
setup
statutorily,
would
that
fall
within
congress's
power
under
article
i?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we
know
what
--
and
we
know
what
power
they
are
relying
on.
let's
just
look
at
the
power
that
they're
relying
on
here:
it's
the
power
to
make
rules
for
the
regulation
of
the
military.
so
part
of
their
--
in
the
exercise
of
their
power
to
make
rules
for
the
regulation
of
the
military,
they
impose
a
civil
sex
offender
registration
requirement
for
someone
convicted
of
a
sex
offense
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
that
does
not,
in
your
judgment,
fall
within
article
i?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
let
me
try
this
chain
of
reasoning
out
on
you
and
--
and
get
your
reaction.
we're
starting
out
with
the
power
of
congress
to
make
rules
for
the
regulation
of
the
military.
and
one
of
the
things
that
they
want
to
do
in
making
those
rules
is
to
make
military
installations
acceptable
to
the
local
communities
where
they
are
located.
they
know
from
experience,
for
example,
it's
happened
in
okinawa,
that
when
have
you
military
personnel
who
go
--
who
commit
sex
offenses
with
people
off
base,
it
can
cause
tremendous
opposition.
and
this
is
what
happened
here;
not
the
opposition,
but
an
offense
involving
a
15-year-old
girl
who
lived
off
the
base.
so
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
--
we
don't
have
excessive
civilian
opposition
to
the
location
of
military
bases,
we
are
going
to
do
a
number
of
things.
one
thing
is
we're
going
to
criminally
prosecute
members
of
the
military
who
commit
these
offenses.
this
will
deter;
this
will
incapacitate.
but
also,
to
provide
further
assurance
to
the
community
that
these
people
are
not
going
to
be
dangerous,
we
are
going
to
require
them
to
register.
now,
maybe
that's
too
attenuated,
but
i'd
like
to
get
your
reaction.
why
could
congress
not
do
that
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
your
argument
that
congress
lacks
the
power
to
impose
supervised
release
after
the
date
when
the
person
leaves
the
military?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
someone
is
sentenced
to
prison--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--under
the
ucmj,
released,
dishonorably
discharged
from
the
military.
can
congress
say
the
person
has
to
remain
on
supervised
release
for
a
longer
period
of
time
after
he
is
returned
to
civilian
status?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
see,
i
understand
--
i
can
understand
why
that
might
create
--
that
might
raise
all
sorts
of
constitutional
arguments
about
notice
and
so
forth.
but
i
don't
see
how
that
--
how
that
connects
with
the
question
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
do
it
under
--
under
article
i--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--under
the
power
to
regulate
the
military.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
could
be
making
the
argument
that
the
power
to
make
rules
for
the
military
applies
only
to
people
who
are
in
the
military,
and
that
once
you're
out
of
the
military
that
power
does
not
permit
congress
to
do
anything
special
to
you.
but
you're
not
making
that
argument,
i
gather.
