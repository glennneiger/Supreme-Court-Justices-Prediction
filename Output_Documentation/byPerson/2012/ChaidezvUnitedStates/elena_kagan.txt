justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
fisher,
think
about
this
in
an
aedpa
context.
i
mean,
assume
that
you
have
these
ten
circuit
courts
all
going
in
the
way
that
the
chief
justice
said,
and
then
one
court
came
along
and
said,
you
know,
we
think
that
they
--
in
an
aedpa
context,
a
habeas
consideration
of
a
state
conviction
--
we
think
that
this
is
all
wrong,
and,
in
fact,
the
law
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
ten
circuits
have
held.
wouldn't
we
think
that
that's
a
very
easy
case
that
the
aedpa
standard
had
not
been
met?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fisher,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
case
presents
a
kind
of
threshold
question.
before
you
get
to
the
question
of
what
are
prevailing
professional
norms
and
whether
they
have
been
complied
with,
there
is
the
question
of
whether
the
sixth
amendment
applies
to
collateral
consequences
at
all
and,
if
so,
which
collateral
consequences.
and
that
is
the
question
on
which
padilla
opines,
and
that's
the
question
that
seems,
you
know,
very
different
from
anything
that
strickland
discussed,
not
just
an
application
of
strickland.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
even
before
the
1996
act,
deportation
--
there
were
deportation
consequences.
those
consequences
were
enhanced
by
the
1996
act;
but,
even
before
that,
a
reasonable
lawyer,
you
might
think,
would
have
a
conversation
with
his
client
about
the
deportation
consequences
of
a
conviction.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fisher,
before
you
get
to
the
reasons--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
government
says
that
you
forfeited
this
argument.
could
you
address
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
haven't
presented
this
argument
to
any
court
before;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dreeben,
if
justice
breyer
were
right,
that
there
should
be
sort
of
one
run
--
run
up
the
flagpole
and
that
teague
doesn't
kick
in
until
that
one
run
up
the
flagpole
and
here
because
of
massaro
the
one
run
should
include
collateral
review
of
iac
claims,
if
that's
right,
what
are
the
costs
of
that?
is
that
an
extra
year
to
the
statute
of
limitations
for
bringing
a
collateral
claim
or
is
it
something
more
than
that?
justice
elena
kagan
three
years
ago
in
the
case
called
padilla
v.
kentucky,
this
court
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
criminal
defense
attorneys
to
warn
their
clients
whenever
pleading
guilty
to
a
crime
could
cause
them
to
be
deported.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
decision
applies
retroactively
so
that
the
defendants
whose
convictions
became
final
prior
to
padilla
can
benefit
from
its
rule.
the
petitioner
here,
roselva
chaidez,
pleaded
guilty
to
two
crimes
that
unbeknownst
to
her
made
her
deportable.
her
convictions
became
final
in
200.
after
the
government
initiated
deportation
proceedings,
she
filed
this
suite,
she
can
collateral
relief
to
overturn
her
convictions.
she
argued
that
her
attorney's
failure
to
inform
her
that
pleading
guilty
could
lead
to
deportation
constituted
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
while
her
suit
was
pending,
we
held
in
padilla
that
her
view
of
the
sixth
amendment
was
right,
but
the
court
below,
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
chaidez
could
not
benefit
from
padilla
because
her
conviction
became
final
before
we
decided
that
case.
the
tests
we
used
to
determine
whether
one
of
our
criminal
procedure
decisions
applies
retroactively
comes
from
a
case
called
teague
v.
lane.
in
teague,
we
held
that
any
decision
announcing
a
new
rule
would
not
apply
to
people
like
chaidez
whose
conviction
had
already
become
final.and
we
explained
that
a
case
announces
a
new
rule
whenever
its
result
was
not
dictated
by
precedent
existing
at
the
time
the
defendant's
conviction
became
final.
but
in
another
way,
a
decision
is
new
if
its
result
would
not
already
have
been
apparent
to
all
reasonable
judges.
if
padilla
announced
a
new
rule
according
to
this
test,
chaidez
cannot
benefit
from
it.
at
the
same
time,
we
have
said
that
a
case
does
not
announce
a
new
rule
when
it
merely
applies
a
general
standard
from
a
prior
decision
to
a
new
set
of
facts.
one
such
standard
is
the
test
we
established
in
strickland
v.
washington
for
assessing
when
a
lawyer
has
given
a
criminal
defendant
incompetent
advice
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
garnering
variety
applications
of
strickland
do
not
produce
new
rules.
so,
if
our
decision
in
padilla
had
merely
applied
strickland
had
merely
said
that
a
lawyer
who
fails
to
inform
his
client
about
deportation
is
professionally
incompetent,
then
we
would
not
have
announced
a
new
rule.
but
we
hold
today
the
padilla
did
something
more.
before
the
padilla
court
could
apply
strickland,
it
had
to
decide
as
a
threshold
matter
whether
strickland
had
any
relevance
to
the
case
at
all.
and
in
doing
that,
the
court
announced
a
new
rule.
before
padilla,
courts
across
the
country
held
that
the
strickland
test
was
utterly
irrelevant
when
a
lawyer
provided
or
failed
to
provide
advice
about
deportation.
that's
because
deportation
was
viewed
as
a
collateral
consequence
of
a
conviction,
something
outside
the
scope
of
the
criminal
proceeding
itself.
on
this
view,
a
lawyer
could
act
completely
incompetently
with
respect
to
giving
advice
about
deportation
and
a
way
that
clearly
would
have
flunked
the
strickland
test
and
still
it
would
not
count
as
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
because
it
was
about
an
immigration
matter,
which
was
separate
from
the
criminal
from
the
criminal
proceeding.
before
padilla
came
along,
nearly
40
state
and
lower
federal
courts
had
adapted
that
view.only
two
had
held
to
the
contrary.
what
padilla
did
that
was
new
and
it
was
very
new
was
to
say
that
this
understanding
of
the
sixth
amendment
scope
was
wrong.
padilla
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
applied
to
a
lawyer
giving
a
criminal
defendant
advice
about
deportation,
even
though
deportation
was
a
matter
of
separate
from
the
criminal
preceding.
in
other
words,
padilla
held
for
the
first
time
that
advice
about
deportation
consequences
had
to
satisfy
the
sixth
amendment
and
so
had
to
pass
the
strickland
test.
only
after
we
decided
that
could
we
proceed
to
apply
strickland
in
a
usual
way.
and
that
preliminary
holding
was
not
apparent
to
all
reasonable
judges
before
we
decided
padilla.
indeed,
as
i
have
just
indicated,
it
was
hardly
apparent
to
any
of
them
and
our
decision
changed
the
prevailing
law
in
almost
every
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states.
we
accordingly
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
sotomayor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
joins.
