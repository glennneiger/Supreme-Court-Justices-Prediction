justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
always
the
case.
i
mean,
we
--
we
never
come
out
with
a
decision
that
doesn't
rely
upon
some
preexisting
principle.
we
always
cite
some
preexisting
principle.
does
that
mean
that
every
case
of
ours
is
--
is
not
new
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
pick
on
strickland?
i
mean,
you
could
say
that
about
any
principle
of
law
that
we
rely
on:
the
dissent
thought
that
that
principle
applied
a
different
way
here.
what
is
different
about
strickland
that
it
enables
you
to
appeal
to
that,
as
opposed
to
appealing
to
any
principle
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
new
law
is
not
a
new
pronouncement
which
nobody
had
ever
thought
of
before,
but
only
a
pronouncement
that
rests
upon
an
evolution
of
mores;
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
thought
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fisher,
i
suppose
you
are
right,
i'm
sure
you're
right
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
a
dissent
in
the
case
that
adopted
the
rule
does
not
necessarily
make
it
a
new
rule.
but
you,
on
the
other
hand,
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
those
who
dissented
from
that
case
would
regard
it
as
a
new
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it's
an
easy
question
to
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fair.
the
dissenters
ought
to
reconsider,
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
--
what's
the
sense
of
that?
why
--
why
--
let's
assume,
you
know,
at
the
time
the
guilty
plea
or
whatever
occurred,
it
was
not
the
professional
norm,
and
then
later
the
professional
norms
change
and
he
makes
the
argument
that
--
that
he's
entitled
to
relief,
and
you
say
yes,
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
what
your
opponent
contends
as
well?
