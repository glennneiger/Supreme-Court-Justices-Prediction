mr.
fisher--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
--
what
about
the
argument
that
strickland
doesn't
come
into
play
unless
the
sixth
amendment
includes
the
collateral
consequences
in
counsel's
obligation
to
defend
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
under
the
argument
that
up
to
--
up
to
padilla,
only
advice
relevant
to
guilt
or
innocence
and
sentencing
was
required,
not
collateral
consequences?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
also
a
question
if
--
if
conviction
meant
loss
of
a
professional
license,
that
would
be
an
open
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
--
mr.
fisher,
is
there
any
application,
application
of
strickland,
that
would
qualify
as
a
new
rule,
any
application
at
all,
or
is
just
strickland
never
a
new
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
answered
that
question
when
i
asked
it,
you
said
that
removal
of
a
professional
license
would
not
fall
under
--
wouldn't
--
would
be
at
least
an
open
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fisher--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
fisher,
are
you
--
you're
not
making
any
argument
that
teague
is
inapplicable
because
this
--
the
underlying
conviction
here
is
a
federal
conviction,
not
a
state
conviction,
and
teague
emphasized
comity
to
the
states;
you're
not
making
that
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
padilla
itself
was
a
collateral
proceeding.
and
if
the
state
can
argue
in
padilla
itself
that
a
new
rule
was
being
sought
and
that
that
was
permissible
only
on
direct
review,
should
the
state
have
prevailed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
court
is
a
federal
court,
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
your
concern
of
teague
is
comity,
concern
about
the
states
running
their
own
system,
i
understand
the
different
--
the
state
collateral
and
the
federal
collateral
view;
but,
if
the
idea
of
teague
is
we
don't
want
the
federal
court
to
come
in
there
and
overlook
what
the
state
court
did,
why
wouldn't
that
apply
to
this
court
reviewing
a
state
court
decision
as
much
as
it
would
apply
to
a
federal
district
court
at
a
hearing
habeas
from
a
state
conviction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
we
know
that
that's
true
in
kentucky?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
court
could
not
have
raised
it
on
its
own?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
we
applied
--
have
we
applied
teague
to
federal
convictions
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
hasn't.
and
at
least
one
important
basis
for
the
teague
rule
is
the
comity
to
the
state
court
system,
which
you
don't
have
when
the
underlying
conviction
is
a
federal
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
--
it
was
approved
by
the
judicial
conference
in
september.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
you
said
you
recognize
that
we
have
not
had
a
teague
case
involving
a
federal
conviction,
i
mean,
there
is
lots
of
language
in
teague
cases
about
the
federal
courts
not
interfering
with
state
courts,
that
teague
was
intended
to
minimize
federal
intrusion
into
state
criminal
proceedings,
to
limit
the
authority
of
the
federal
courts
to
overturn
state
convictions.
i
mean,
we
have
really
pressed
that
--
that
basis.
