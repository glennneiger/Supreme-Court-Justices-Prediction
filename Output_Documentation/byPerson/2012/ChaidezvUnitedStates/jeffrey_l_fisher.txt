mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
more
than
20
years
since
this
court
decided
teague
v.
lane,
it's
had
more
than
a
dozen
cases
in
which
people
have
sought
habeas
relief
based
on
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
but
this
court
has
never
once
held
that
applying
strickland
in
those
divergent
actual
settings
constituted
a
new
rule.
for
two
reasons,
this
court
should
reject
the
government's
argument
to
do
so
for
the
first
time
here.
first,
padilla
was
dictated
by
precedent;
that
is,
like
other
strickland
cases
that
came
before
it,
this
court
in
padilla
simply
applied
strickland's
formula
of
assessing
attorney
performance
according
to
prevailing
professional
norms
to
a
new
set
of
facts.
the
second--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
two
--
two
things
about
the
lower
courts.
the
first
is,
there
are
only
three
lower
court
decisions
that
postdate
the
1996
act
that
the
government
can
cite
that
came
out
the
other
way
in
terms
of
the
question
presented
here.
and
the
second
thing
is,
even
within
those
cases
and
within
those
courts,
they
didn't
distinguish
between
deportation
advice
and
other
kinds
of
advice.
they
distinguished
between
acts
and
omissions;
that
is
to
say,
it
was
a
uniform
rule
in
the
lower
courts
at
the
time
this
court
decided
padilla
that
misadvice
concerning
the
right
to
--
i'm
sorry,
concerning
deportation
consequences
of
a
plea
did
violate
strickland.
so
the
distinction
in
lower
courts
was
not
between
deportation
advice
and
other
kinds
of
advice;
the
distinction
was
between
acts
and
omissions.
and
in
padilla
itself--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
obviously,
there
was
a
dissent
in
padilla,
but
this
court
has
held
before
that
new
applications
of
strickland
did
not
constitute
a
new
rule,
even
though
there
were
dissents.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
in
williams--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
that
was
obviously
the
argument
that
the
state
of
kentucky
made
in
that
case,
and
this
court
dealt
with
it
in
part
two
of
padilla.
now,
remember,
justice
ginsburg,
the
court
did
not
extend
strickland
to
collateral
consequences
in
padilla.
it
actually
reserved
that
question.
what
it
held
is
that
deportation
consequences
are
not
removed
from
the
ambit
of
the
sixth
amendment.
so,
remember,
strickland--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
--
i
think
that's
an
open
question
after
padilla.
what
this
court
held
in
padilla
--
and
this
is
the
second
to
last
sentence
in
part
two
--
is
that
advice
concerning
deportation
consequences
of
a
guilty
plea
are
not
categorically
removed
from
the
sixth
amendment.
so
what
i
understood
the
court
to
do
in
padilla
was
take
the
ordinary
strickland
formula
of
prevailing
professional
norms
and
simply
apply
it
to
this
criminal
case.
remember,
padilla
itself
was
a
criminal
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
of
course
not.
the
question
this
court
asked
under
teague
is
whether
it
broke
new
ground.
and
i
think
what
this
court
said
in
padilla
is,
we
reject
the
artificial
restriction
on
strickland
that
the
lower
courts
have
created;
so,
therefore,
this
court
simply
reaffirmed
strickland.
it
didn't--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
you
--
you
may
well
find
that,
justice
kagan,
but
the
reason
why
is
because
you'd
find
that
there
was
not
an
unreasonable
application
of
preexisting
law.
what
you
would
not
say
is
that
the
clearly
established
law
is
any
different.
so,
remember,
this
court
--
this
case,
because
it's
a
federal
case,
raises
only
the
first
question
under
aedpa,
in
a
sense,
which
is
what's
the
clearly
established
law?
and
this
is
the
chief
--
i
think
this
is
responsive
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
the
dissent.
there
was
a
disagreement
on
this
court
about
how
to
apply
strickland,
but
the
question's
whether
a
new
legal
rule
was
created,
not
whether
there
was
an
unreasonable
application--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
the
best
response
is
what
this
court
said
in
williams,
which
is
strickland
provides
sufficient
guidance
to
resolve
virtually
every
ineffective
assistance
claim.
so
what
this
court
said
in
williams
is
we
do
not
make
new
law
when
we
apply
strickland.
i
think
justice
kennedy--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
so
long
as
you
simply
applied
strickland,
you
wouldn't
create
a
new
rule.
if
you
for
example,
said,
a
certain
kind
of
claim
does
not
need
to
have
a
prejudice
showing,
that
would
be
a
new
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
kennedy,
it
wouldn't
be
enough
to
have
a
later
evolution
of
prevailing
norms
because
strickland
is
a
backward-looking
device.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
and,
as
i
said,
something
like
a
scenario
where
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
work
with
your
hypothetical.
i
think
what
i
hear
your
hypothetical
to
say
is
that
prevailing
norms
change,
and
they
evolve
to
a
certain
point
where
certain
kinds
of
advice
is
required,
which
is
much
what
this
court
said
in
padilla
about
--
about
deportation
advice.
you
would
have
--
you
would
not
have
a
new
rule
to
simply
recognize
that
at
the
time
that
attorney
gave
advice,
that
--
that
strickland
was
violated.
it
would
be
a
new
rule,
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
to
say
that
strickland
requires
relief,
even
though
at
the
time
the
advice
was
given
the
prevailing
norm
had
not
yet
crystalized
into
the
degree
that
this
court
requires.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--strickland
--
strickland
sets
up
a
two-part
test,
and
we're
only
talking
about
the
first
part,
which
is
attorney
performance.
and
that
--
that
question
is
keyed
to
attorney
performance
at
the
time
judged
by
reasonableness
according
to
prevailing
professional
norms.
now,
those
prevailing
professional
norms
are,
in
a
sense,
a
factual
question,
an
empirical
question
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
let
me
give
you
two
answers
to
that,
because
i
think
that's
the
government's
main
argument
here.
first
is,
as
i've
tried
to
say
before,
simply
saying
that
an
exception
that
the
lower
courts
created
doesn't
exist
doesn't
create
a
new
rule.
imagine
this
court
said
--
laid
down
a
rule
that
covered
all
cars,
and
the
lower
courts
devised
an
exception
to
that
rule
for
convertibles.
and
when
the
court
--
when
the
issue
came
to
this
court,
this
court
said,
well,
no,
when
we
said
all
cars,
we
meant
all
cars.
to
me,
that
doesn't
create
a
new
rule.
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
said
in
part
two
of
padilla,
is
that
this
artificial
restriction
that
the
lower
courts
have
devised
simply
can't
be
grounded
in
strickland--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--pardon
me?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
only
three
federal
circuits
have
had
a
ruling
like
that
after
the
1996
act--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
if
i
can
finish
my
answer,
only
three
had
rulings
like
that
after
the
1996
act,
and
all
three
of
those
relied
on
pre-'96
act
rulings.
and
as
court
of
appeals
judges
said,
that's
just
not
quite
enough
for
us
to
be
entitled
to
overturn
our
prior
circuit
precedent.
but
while
the
government
comes
here
today
and
suggests
that
ten
circuits
and
all
these
state
courts
had
ruled,
in
a
sense,
in
its
favor,
you
know,
it's
almost
more
accurate
to
say
none
had
had
this
issue
cleanly
presented
to
them
after
the
1996
act.
and,
justice
kagan,
if
i--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that
may
well
be
true,
justice
kagan,
but
i'm
saying
in
the
'96
act,
as
this
court
said
in
padilla,
whatever
prevail
--
whatever
doubt
there
may
have
been
about
prevailing
professional
norms
crystallized
at
that
time
because
of
the
severity.
and
i
think
that's
the
second
answer
i
wanted
to
give
to
your
question
about
this
so-called
threshold
question
in
padilla,
is
that
even
if
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
the
sixth
amendment
applies
beyond,
as
the
government
puts
it,
criminal
jeopardy,
this
court
had
answered
that
question
in
st.
cyr,
where
this
court
said,
in
the
text
around
footnotes
48
and
50,
that
any
competent
lawyer
would
give
his
client
advice
and
a
warning
about
deportation
consequences
of
a
plea.
so
even
if
you
needed
more
than
strickland
itself,
st.
cyr
gave
that
to
you
in
2001,
which
is
enough
to
decide
this
case;
it
was
enough
to
decide
padilla.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
it
would
--
i
doubt
it,
justice
alito.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
what
the
prevailing
professional
norms
looked
like.
i
take
it
what
this
court
said
in
strickland
and
what
it
reaffirmed
in
padilla
is,
we're
not
going
to
--
we're
not
going
to
micromanage
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
we're
going
to
leave
it
to
prevailing
professional
norms.
i
seriously
doubt
that
prevailing
professional
norms
would
require
the
holding
that
you
described;
but,
to
the
extend
they
did,
i
don't
think
it
wouldn't
be
a
new
rule.
to
the
extent
they
didn't
and
this
court
said,
we're
going
to
push
the
sixth
amendment
beyond
that,
you
would
have
a
new
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
a
tricky
question
to
answer,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
i
could
answer
it
one
of
two
ways.
one
is
i
could
say
yes,
they
did
--
to
the
extent
they
did
regard
it
as
a
new
rule,
i
think
the
dissent
was,
with
all
due
respect,
slightly
mistaken
about
what
the
holding
in
padilla
was,
which
was
not
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
think
that
the
way
the
dissent
put
it
was
--
is
that
advice
is
now
required
beyond
criminal
cases
and
criminal
jeopardy.
the
way
that
i
think
padilla
--
the
majority
described
its
holding
was
that
this
is
a
criminal
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
entitled
to
advice
from
his
criminal
lawyer,
and
the
most
important
piece
of
advice
as
to
whether
to
take
a
plea
or
not
involves
deportation
consequences.
and,
justice
scalia,
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
it
had
to
be
more
than
that,
justice
kennedy,
because,
of
course,
there
is
lots
of--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--ineffective
assistance
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
no,
no.
but
i'm
saying
there
are
lots
of
ineffective
assistance
cases
before
padilla
that
involved
matters
beyond
the
judge,
that
turned
on
what
the
jury
did,
of
course.
and
i
could
--
i
may
be
able
to
think
of
others
beyond
those
two
scenarios,
but
there's
no
language
to
that
effect
in
padilla.
what
the
court
said
is
that
we
have
never
created
artificial
distinctions
about
what
an
attorney
has
to
do.
as
this
court
put
it
in
strickland,
strickland
itself,
the
client
is
advised
of
his
lawyer's
advice
about
all
important
decisions.
and
as
this
court
said
in
st.
cyr
and
other
cases,
the
most
important
consideration
as
to
whether
to
plead
guilty
is
whether
somebody
will
be
deported.
and
so
you
put
that
together
and
you
had
all
of
the
law
you
needed,
certainly
by
2001.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
some
sort
of
consequences
that
--
that
prevailing
norms
didn't
require
a
lawyer
to
advise
his
client
on.
so,
for
example,
i
would
expect
that
a
lawyer
is
not
necessarily
required
to
give
detailed
advice
about
future
employment
opportunities
to
a
client
depending
on
whether
he
pleads
guilty.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
--
i
think
it
would
be
an
open
question
as
to
how
strickland
would
apply.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
simply
don't
know
what
the
prevailing
professional
norms
are
in
that
situation.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
would
start
with--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes,
that's
what
i
would
do.
and
i
would
look
to
prevailing
professional
norms.
and
i
think,
if
i
could
give
a
generic
answer,
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
that
kind
of
advice
is
so
important
to
the
client's
decision
making
--
and
that's
the
word
the
court
used
in
strickland
--
that
prevailing
norms
require
the
lawyer
to
give
that
kind
of
advice.
if
the
answer
to
that
was
yes--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
no,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i
don't
think
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
i
agree
with
your
premise,
i
think,
that
prevailing
professional
norms
can
and
do
evolve.
and
so
the
question
this
court
asked
in
strickland
is,
as
of
the
time
the
advice
was
given,
did
the
prevailing
norms
require
that?
the
advice
was
given
in
this
case
almost
at
the
identical
time
of
the
advice
in
padilla
and,
indeed,
far
after
st.
cyr.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
what
the
aba
said.
i
believe
the
aba,
quite
rightly,
said,
we
don't
make
constitutional
law
in
this
body;
we
leave
that
to
the
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
there
may
be
elements
of
the
standards
that
did.
but,
remember,
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
aba
here.
as
this
court
noted
in
padilla
and
as
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
from
nacdl
notes
in
this
case,
there's
a
wide--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
then
i'll
rely
on
just
the
overall
body
of
professional
norms,
which
is
what
this
court
looked
to
in
padilla
and
what
it's
always
said
it
has
to
look
to
under
strickland
cases.
if
i
could
return
--
if
i
could
transition
to
talking
about
the
nature
of
the
backward-looking
effect
of
strickland,
i
think
there
is
an
important
second
question
in
this
case,
that
if
this
court
were
inclined
to
hold
that
there
was
a
new
rule,
you'd
be
forced
to
confront.
and
it's
a
very
serious
question
involving
this
court's
administration
of
criminal
appellate
procedure.
and
that
is
whether
teague
ought
to
apply
at
all
in
this
context.
we
believe
that
under
the
system
this
court
established
in
massaro
for
handling
iac
claims,
it
simply
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
apply
teague
here
and,
indeed,
would
throw
a
gigantic
monkey
wrench
into
the
way
things
are
--
have
been
done
for
the
last
decade
after
that
decision.
and
for
two
reasons:
one,
in
theory--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yeah.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
sure.
we
didn't
forfeit
this
argument.
it's
fairly
included
within
our
question
presented.
we
raised
it
at
the
first
available
opportunity
in
the
seventh
circuit
because
we
were
foreclosed
by
circuit
precedent
from
raising
it.
so
we
raised
it
before
an
en
banc
court.
and
in
our
cert
reply
brief,
lest
there
be
any
doubt,
when
the
government
suggested
that
we
would
be
restricted
to
arguing
the
new
rule
question
in
this
case,
we
put
a
footnote
in
our
cert
reply
brief
which
expressly
told
the
court,
no,
we
view
this
question
presented
as
including
this
additional
argument,
whether
teague
applies
or
not.
so
i
think
we
gave
fair
notice
to
the
court.
and
if
you
have
any
doubt--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--we
made
the
argument
in
an
en
banc
petition
to
the
seventh
circuit,
which
we
couldn't
make
it
to
a
panel
because
seventh
circuit
law
had
already
held
that
teague
applied
in
this
context.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
i
think
we
agree
with
the
government
that
it
doesn't
matter.
the
way
we
see
this
is
it's
a
first
federal
filing.
it's
a
first
post-conviction
filing,
and
it's
a
timely
filing.
the
government
is
not
challenging
the
timeliness
of
this
filing.
so
the
question
you
have
to
ask
yourself
is,
under
a
system
where
this
court
has
said
that
iac
claims
should
not
be
brought
on
direct
review,
but
rather
should
be
brought
on
collateral
review,
whether
you
can
apply
teague
at
the
very
first
instance
that
somebody
has
to
make
a
constitutional
claim,
and
we
think
not.
on
theory--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
that's
the
way
the
whole
case
has
been
litigated,
and
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption.
the
reason
that
we're
on
coram
nobis
instead
of--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
you
haven't.
so
if
you
want
to
be
extra
careful,
you
can
--
you
can
say
the
parties
haven't
challenged
that.
remember,
the
reason
that
we're
on
coram
nobis
is
ms.
chaidez
was
not
in
custody.
and
so
if
somebody
--
so
it's,
in
a
sense,
interchangeable
with
a
2255.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
more
severe
in
the
sense
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
in
what
sense.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i'm
not
sure
they
--
i'm
not
sure
they
could,
justice
alito.
at
pet.
app.
38,
you'll
see
the
district
court
dealing
with
the
timeliness
of
this
petition.
and
the
district
court
finds
that
ms.
chaidez
could
proceed
because
she
used
all
reasonable
diligence
in
bringing
this
claim.
and
the
government
can
make
laches
arguments,
can
make
other
arguments
to
defeat
that.
the
government
has
renounced
those
--
i
mean,
they
let
those
arguments
go
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
don't
raise
them
again
here.
but
i
think
that,
at
a
minimum,
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
somebody
needs
to
bring
a
petition
as
soon
as
the
government
advises
them
they're
going
to
seek
deportation.
i'm
not
even
sure,
justice
alito--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--you
could
--
you
could
have
a
time
lag,
but
there
is
two
things
to
remember.
first
is,
you
might
have
a
timely
2255
in
that
circumstance,
too,
because,
remember,
in
holland
v.
florida,
this
court
held
that
equitable
tolling
is
available
for
people
with
ia
--
with
ineffective
assistance
that
leads
to
them
not
being
able
to
make
the
claim
earlier.
and
the
second
thing
is,
as
i
was
discussing
with
justice
kennedy,
the
backward-looking
aspect
of
strickland
would
--
would
require
the
party
--
once
you
get
more
than
a
little
while
back,
the
prevailing
norms
may
not
--
may
not
be
there
for
that
kind
of
a
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and
so
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
i
think
you
could
hold
that,
and
that
is
--
that
is
within
our
argument.
i
don't
think
you
need
to
go
that
far,
justice
ginsburg.
as
you
said,
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
teague
relies
on
comity.
that's
not
present
in
this
case.
but
we
think
a
narrower
way
to
decide
this
case,
and
i
think
the
appropriate
way
to
decide
this
case,
is
to
say,
at
least
for
ineffective
assistance
claims,
when
you're
bringing
--
with
a
federal
prisoner,
or
somebody
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
federal
crime,
that's
bringing
their
first
petition,
that
teague
can't
apply.
and
what
i
was
just
trying
to
say
is
strickland
itself--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
justice
kennedy,
i'm
glad
you
asked
because
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
say.
in
strickland,
this
court
dealt
with
finality
very
explicitly
and
said,
we're
creating
this
standard
which
is
different
than
other
constitutional
standards
because
we're
concerned
about
finality.
and,
as
this
court
said
at
pages
697
and
98,
so,
therefore,
no
different
rules
ought
to
apply
in
collateral
proceedings
as
in
direct
review,
because
this
court
assumed
in
strickland
itself
and
it
assumed
expressly
again
in
padilla
that
all
of
these
claims
would
be
on
collateral
review.
so
in
all
these
cases
the
court
has
said
finality
--
the
concern
--
the
very
concern
you
mentioned,
justice
kennedy,
is
already
baked
into
the
strickland
formula.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yeah.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yeah.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
okay.
let
me
answer
both
those
things.
first,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
create
an
exception
to
teague.
we
are
simply
asking
this
court
to
say
teague
doesn't
apply
when
a
claim
is,
quote,
"on
the
equivalent
of
direct
review.
"
which
is
what
this
court
said
in
martinez
v.
ryan.
this
court
has
already
held
with
respect
to
iac
that
habeas
rules,
like
the
procedural
default
rule
and
like
the
stone
v.
powell
bar
against
fourth
amendment
claims,
do
not
apply
in
the
iac
context.
so
this
follows
exactly
from
those
previous
holdings.
now,
let
me
say
two
other
things
and
then
i
can
hopefully
reserve
my
time.
to
answer
your
question
about
martinez
in
state
cases,
it
would
depend
on
what
the
state
system
looked
like,
and
i
think
states
have
their
own
decision
to
make
as
to
whether
they
want
a
system
like
arizona's,
where
these
have
to
be
brought
in
collateral
proceedings,
or
whether,
as
i
understand
at
least
a
couple
of
states
do,
say,
we're
going
to
stay
and
delay
the
entire
direct
review
process,
for
years
often,
to
allow
the
iac
claim
to
be
brought
then.
now,
that's
exactly
what
this
court
rejected
in
massaro,
and
the
government
asked
this
court
to
reject
that
in
massaro;
said
we
don't
want
that
kind
of
a
system.
i
don't
know
why
the
government
is
asking
for
it
for
the
first
time
today.
and
finally
remember,
the
last
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is,
all
these
problems
raise
not
only
finality
concerns
about
the
stay
and
remand
procedures
the
government
suggests;
they
also
raise
insoluble
conflicts
of
interest
problems
for
federal
defender
offices,
who
would
have
to
bring
iac
claims
against
themselves
on
direct
review
in
order
to
preserve
their
ability
to
--
to
get
full
relief
for
their
client.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
kennedy,
what
i
would
like
to
do,
and
i
am
happy
to
elaborate,
if
the
formulation
as
i
think
you
yourself
put
it
in
wright
v.
west,
which
is
that
a
rule
that
is,
that
is
applied
to
a
new
set
of
facts
does
not
create
a
new
rule;
but
if
you
advance
the
law
in
some
way
you
do
create
a
new
rule.
the
last
thing
i
would
like
to
say
about
consequences
is:
remember,
the
government
doesn't
even
have
any
answer
for
what
is
going
to
be
half
or
more
of
the
situations
where
people
have
padilla-type
claims,
which
is
when
they
have
a
guilty
plea
and
waive
their
right
to
direct
appeal.
so
there
the
collateral
filing
like
this
is
--
is
absolutely
the
equivalent
of
direct
review.
and
so
i
think
this
court
ought
to
be
very
wary
of
going
down
that
road.
if
i
could
reserve
the
time
i
have
left.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
make
two
points.
the
first
is,
picking
up
where
mr.
dreeben
left
off,
i'm
not
asking
for
any
anything
that
is
difficult.
mr.
dreeben
referred
to
the
frady
case,
where
this
court
held
that
there
is
enough
of
an
interest
in
finality
to
have
procedural
default
apply
to
federal
post-conviction
review.
yet,
in
massaro,
this
court
carved
out
iac
claims.
exactly
the
same
analysis
applies
here,
and
i
do
think
the
court
really
ought
to
answer
that
question
in
this
case
because,
if
you
hold
that
padilla
is
a
new
rule
and
that
teague
now
applies
to
iac
claims,
rest
assured
the
federal
courthouses
are
going
to
be
flooded,
flooded
with
federal
--
with
federal
defenders
and
other
criminal
lawyers
raising
iac
claims
on
direct
review.
there'd
be
nothing
else
a
responsible
lawyer
could
do,
because
if
you
say
teague
applies
on
--
if
you
wait
until
collateral
review,
but
it
doesn't
apply
on
direct
review,
any
responsible
lawyer
seeking
to
protect
his
client
has
to
bring
it
on
direct
review.
it's
going
to
absolutely
change
the
way
criminal
procedure
and
criminal
appellate
procedure
happens
in
the
federal
court
system.
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
back
to
the
new
rule
question.
i
think
i
heard
mr.
dreeben
say
that
the
lower
courts
that
had
said
that
misadvice
about
deportation
consequences
violated
strickland
had
said
something
that
was
within
strickland
that
didn't
constitute
a
new
rule.
so
it
can't
be
that
strickland
broke
new
ground,
if
he's
correct,
by
saying
deportation
advice
falls
within
the
ambit
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
a
guilty
plea
context.
the
only
thing
he
relies
on
in
the
end
is
this
distinction
the
lower
courts
had
drawn
between
acts
and
omissions.
and
that's
exactly
the
distinction
in
strickland
that
this
court
rejected.
and
in
padilla
itself,
this
court
used
the
word
absurd.
and
i
think,
justice
kennedy,
when
you
mentioned
common
sense,
i
think
we
could
throw
that
in,
too.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
the
argument,
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
everything's
stripped
away,
is
that
the
lower
courts
were
reasonable
in
saying
that
failing
to
advise
about
the
most
important
thing
a
client
would
have
been
thinking
as
to
whether
to
plead
guilty
is
not
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
whereas
giving
bad
advice
is,
that's
a
line
that
strickland
itself
rejected,
that
flores-ortega
rejected
when
it
came
to
the
right
to
appeal
and
whether
the
lawyer
ought
to
give
advice;
and,
it's
a
line
that
this
court
in
padilla
had
no
difficulty
whatsoever
rejecting
and
called
it
absurd.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
it's
not,
justice
sotomayor.
the
issue
arises
because
teague
ordinarily
comes
into
play
when
somebody
asks
the
court
to
create
a
new
rule
and
apply
it
to
him.
so
all
the
hypotheticals
we've
talked
about
today,
about
would
strickland
apply
here,
would
strickland
apply
there,
to
parole
advice,
to
professional
license,
all
of
those
claims
would
be
asking,
if
the
government's
correct,
for
a
new
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and
so
all
of
those
claims
would
have
to
be
brought.
thank
you.
