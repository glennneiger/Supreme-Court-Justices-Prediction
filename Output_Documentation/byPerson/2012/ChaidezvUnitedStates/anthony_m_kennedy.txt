justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
a
really
skilled
attorney,
after
negotiating
a
plea
bargain,
or
even
representing
a
client
at
trial
but
then
losing,
is
very
skilled
in
ensuring
that
the
defendant
can
go
into
the
general
population,
not
into
solitary
confinement;
but
also
a
skilled
trial
attorney,
he's
just
not
very
good
at
that,
so
the
defendant
goes
to
solitary.
could
--
if
there
was
an
evolution
of
the
law
of
adequate
assistance
of
counsel
so
that
this
court
later
held,
oh,
conditions
of
confinement
have
to
be
a
part
of
the
attorney's
skill
and
competence
in
representation,
that
that
would
be
retroactive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
there
are
then,
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
some
cases
in
which
there
could
be
a
new
rule
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
under
strickland?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
understand
how
that
works
with
my
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
predicate
question
we
decided
in
padilla
was
that
strickland
applies
to
matters
not
within
the
control
of
the
trial
judge.
that
it
seems
to
me
was
a
holding
the
court
had
not
addressed
before
and
that
other
courts
had
not
addressed
before.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
this
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
predicate
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
us
to
write
this
opinion
in
support
of
your
position,
and
to
begin
by
saying,
prevailing
professional
norms
do
not
change?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
--
that
the
defense
bar
generally
would
want
to
say
that
prevailing
professional
norms
change,
but
that
--
that
hurts
you
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
notice
--
i'm
not
sure
it
was
cited
in
the
brief,
but
the
aba
comment
in
1999
said,
now
the
aba
standard
applies
to
professional
standards,
and
that
goes
beyond
the
constitutional
minimum.
so
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
help
you,
either.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
said,
it
should
be
stated
that
these
standards
do
more
than
enforce
the
constitutional
minimum.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
--
i'm
talking
about
the
aba
here,
if
you
want
to
give
some
other
authority;
but,
i
say
that,
it
seems
to
me,
does
not
help
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
--
except
that
--
and
i'm
interrupting,
in
a
sense,
but
it's
on
the
same
track
--
except
that
it
seems
to
me
that
teague
does
serve
the
interest
of
repose,
quite
apart
from
interference
with
a
federal
proceeding,
and
that
interest
is
surely
sacrificed
by
the
holding
you
wish
us
to
make
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
on
rebuttal
--
i
recognize
the
white
light's
on
--
you
could
address
what
is
--
what
is
the
standard
you
want
me
to
apply
to
determine
retroactivity?
the
recess,
oh,
well,
it's
just
new
facts
applying
to
the
same
general
rule.
well,
danger
invites
rescue;
the
assault
on
privity
is
proceeding
apace;
macpherson
v.
buick
and
the
erie
railroad
case
--
it
seems
to
me
that
those
were
probably
new
rules,
but
there
--
it's
because
the
facts
told
us
what
should
be
negligent.
if
at
some
point
you
could
address
that,
i
don't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
i
recall,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
one
of
the
principal
sources
the
court
cited
in
padilla
was
common
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
common
sense
change?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
tom
paine
wrote
about
it,
so,
you
know,
since
its
original.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
--
what
is
the
standard
that
you
wish
us
to
apply?
a
new
rule
is
announced
when
--
when
you
fill
in
the
blank.
and
after
you
fill
in
the
blank,
is
your
principal
argument
that
here
the
distinction
is
between
the
direct
consequences
of
the
conviction
that
are
under
the
control
of
the
court
and
collateral
consequences?
two
different
questions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
little
bit
like
the
aedpa
standard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
second
part
of
my
question
that
you
were
about
to
answer
was
whether
or
not
it's
dictated
by
precedent,
and
in
this
case,
it
was
not
dictated
by
precedent
because
it
applied
to
collateral
consequences;
or,
what's
the
because?
