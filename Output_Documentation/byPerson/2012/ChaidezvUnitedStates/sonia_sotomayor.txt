mr.
fisher,
i'm
concerned
that
creating
exceptions
to
exceptions
in
teague
is
just
a
throwback
to
linkletter
standard--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--where
we're
making
choices
among
situations
and
saying,
these
will
be
retroactive,
these
won't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
answer
that
concern
on
my
part.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
then
answer
--
the
next
step
is
the
martinez
type
case--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
is
what
happens
with
state
reviews
that
are
--
that
channel
iac
claims
to
their
habeas
processes.
so
what
trumps
what
in
that
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
that's
true
with
respect
to
both
components
of
the
advice,
the
omission
and
commission?
i
mean,
it
does
appear
that
every
court
who
dealt
with
the
commission-type
claim,
the
fraud,
the
misrepresentation
of
consequences,
said
it's
clear
you
can't
lie
to
your
client.
now,
is
teague
now
going
--
is
our
ruling
here
going
to
depend
on
the
type
of
claim
that's
raised,
with
respect
to
iac?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
least
one
of
our
concurrences
did,
or
talked
to.
so
assuming
--
assuming
--
is
your
position
that
is
on
the
retroactivity,
that
it
applies
to
both
kinds,
omissions
and
commissions,
and
neither
is
retroactive?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure.
are
those
sources
--
when
you
say
sources,
it's
professional
norm
sources?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
where
--
my
colleagues
were
asking
about
hypothetical
future
cases
--
i'm
asking,
do
you
think
that
every
evolving
professional
norm,
no
matter
how
well
established
it
becomes,
would
never
be
subject
to
the
teague
rule
because
--
would
always
be
a
retroactive
application
or
a
new
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
we
frozen
in
time
to
whatever
the
professional
standards
are
that
exist
today
that
the
court
has
recognized
so
far?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
unanimous
error
makes
right?
i'm
not
being
--
i'm
not
trying
to
be
sarcastic.
i'm
trying
to
see
--
in
almost
every
case
we
get
here,
there
are
split
opinions
below.
sometimes
the
split
is
significant
or
closer
than
other
times.
the
--
where
do
we
draw
that
line?
where
in
the
next
case
is
any
time
there
is
a
split
below
or
where
there's
an
unanimity
of
opinion
below,
it
won't
fall
under
--
it
will
automatically
create
a
new
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
--
we're
seeming
to
go
backwards.
you
--
you
seem
to
be
arguing
against
something
that
you
didn't
want
previously,
that
there
should
be
a
stay
and
determine
these
iac
claims
on
direct
appeal.
it
seems
to
be
your
argument
that
that's
the
preferred
process
now.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
fisher,
can
i
go
back
to
one
of
your
points?
your
red
light
is
on,
but
it
is
important.
the
floodgate
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
about
the
floodgates
for
the
following
reason.
once
we
announce
padilla,
any
pending
direct
claim
and
any
pending
collateral
claim
that
arises
after
padilla
for
something
that
happened
after
padilla
would
be
covered
by
the
rule,
so
there'd
be
no
bar
to
those
claims.
so
the
floodgate
is
temporary,
if
there
is--
