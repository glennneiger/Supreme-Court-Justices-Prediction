justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
had?
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
it
was
common
sense
that
a
lawyer
should
tell
the
client
the
terrible
things
that
are
going
to
happen
to
him
if
he
pleads
guilty,
those
things
that
the
lawyer
knows
or
should
know
about
and
the
client
may
not.
all
right.
that's
a
very
general
rule
at
that
level.
but
some
courts
have
said,
no,
that
isn't
true.
that
isn't
true
unless
--
if
it's
--
as
justice
kagan
said,
if
it's
a
collateral
exception,
if
it's
a
collateral
consequence.
was
it
only
kentucky,
or
was
it
fairly
widespread,
this
exception?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
aren't
that
many.
there
are
11,
and
two
of
them
are
specialized.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
given
the
aba
and
everything
else,
why
doesn't
that
apply
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
i
mean
if
the
general
rule
is
that
strickland
evolves
to
pick
up
changing
professional
norms,
and
that
--
you
looked
at
30
cases
and
that's
what
you
get
out
of
them
--
and
then
it
turns
out
that
at
the
time
this
case
began,
there
was
such
a
professional
norm;
and
all
that
happened
in
padilla
is
that
the
court
following
its
general
practice
said
apply
that
professional
norm;
then
why
doesn't
the
other
side
win?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that,
of
course,
is
true,
but
the
professional
norm
had
evolved
by
the
time
of
the
proceeding
here
that
they
would.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
--
in
the
other
--
in
the
other,
by
the
way,
in
the
other
29
cases,
did
the
court
specifically
say
in
each
of
those
29
cases
that
the
basis
of
our
decision
is
that
the
professional
norm
has
evolved
and
we
apply
the
new
professional
norm
as
of
the
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
go
back
for
a
second
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
i'd
like
--
i
just
don't
want
you
to
leave
without
--
without
answering
the
following:
normally
a
new
rule
that
this
court
announces
would
apply
to
cases
on
direct
review.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
in
the
case
of
inadequate
assistance
of
counsel,
without
being
picky,
the
place
where
that
claim
is
best
developed,
in
my
view
is
first
collateral,
because
for
reasons
we
both
understand.
all
right.
so
given
the
fact
that
by
and
large
it
is,
and
i
think
should
be,
developed
in
that
way,
why
not
treat
in
the
case
of
an
inadequate
assistance
claim
the
first
collateral
as
in
other
claims
you
treat
direct
review?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
could
say
that,
you
could
say
that
same
thing
precisely
about
the
cases
on
direct
review
which
have
not
been
completed.
i
mean,
you
could
give
all
those
arguments
exactly
the
same.
if
you're
worried
about
the
time,
you
could
have
time
limits
on
the
first
federal
--
the
first
federal
habeas
or
state
habeas.
there
are
time
limits
there.
you
could
add
to
those.
and
the
--
the
--
the
direct
review
is
itself
a
balance.
it's
a
balance
between
the
surprise
and
need
to
complicate
the
case,
and
it
hasn't
really
finished
and
da,
da,
da,
versus
the
problem
of
giving
a
person
a
chance
to
raise
this
argument
even
for
a
new
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
all
those
--
those
are
the
--
when
you
look
at
the
functional
factors,
it
looks
quite
similar
to
me
and
i'm
trying
to--
