mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
padilla
v.
kentucky
this
court
announced
a
new
rule
within
the
meaning
of
teague
v.
lane.
because--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
this
court
in
padilla
didn't
distinguish
between
misadvice
and
omissions
to
give
advice.
and
it
therefore
adopted--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
for
--
as
for
padilla's
rationale,
the
answer
is
yes,
but
there
is
a
rationale
that
governed,
in
our
view,
misadvice
claims
that
existed
before
padilla.
it
wasn't
addressed
or
embraced
in
padilla.
it
was
addressed
in
justice
alito's
concurring
opinion.
justice
alito
gave
two
reasons
which
essentially
mirrored
the
reasons
that
had
been
given
in
the
lower
courts
for
treating
misadvice
differently.
and
that
is,
affirmative
misadvice
violated
a
more
basic
duty
of
counsel
that
was
well
established,
which
is
not
to
represent
that
you're
competent
on
a
matter
that
you
are
not
competent.
and
the
second
distinction
between
misadvice
and
failure
to
give
any
advice
is
that
a
client
has
a
constitutional
right
to
make
his
or
her
own
decision
about
whether
to
plead
guilty;
and
a
lawyer
has
a
constitutional
duty
not
to
get
in
the
way
of
that
by
affirmatively
skewing
the
client's
ability
to
make
that
choice.
and
so
i
would
probably
not
disagree
that
misadvice
claim
was
not
new
before
padilla
and
it's
not
really
addressed
by
padilla's
rationale.
it
has
its
own
independent
sources,
and
the
courts
that
had
adopted
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
a
different
professional
norm
and
it's
a
different
aspect
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
and
all
of
the
courts
that
had
adopted
misadvice
--
there
were
three
of
them
that
had
done
it
in
the
removal
context;
there
were
three
more
that
had
done
in
the
parole
eligibility
context
--
they
all
simultaneously
adhered
to
the
view
that
as
a
general
matter
there
is
no
obligation
to
give
advice
about
collateral
consequences.
and
they
did
this,
i
might
add,
despite
the
fact
that,
as
justice
kennedy
alluded,
the
aba,
which
was
cited
as
one
of
the
key
sources
of
prevailing
professional
norms,
stated
in
standard
14.3.2,
in
the
criminal
justice
pleas
of
guilty
standards:
"to
the
extent
possible,
defense
counsel
should
determine
and
advise
the
defendant
sufficiently
in
advance
of
any
plea
as
to
the
possible
collateral
consequences
that
might
ensue
from
entry
of
the
contemplated
plea.
"
so
there
was
an
aspirational
professional
norm
that
collateral
consequences
would
be
on
the
table,
but
all
federal
courts
that
had
looked
at
this
question
before
padilla
had
concluded
that
collateral
consequences
are
outside
of
the
duty
of
criminal
defense
counsel.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
sotomayor.
and
i
think
this
is
the
key
point
about
strickland.
justice
kennedy
made
this
point
in
a
concurrence
in
wright
v.
west,
and
it
was
later
cited
by
the
court
as
--
as
reflecting
an
accurate
understanding
of
strickland.
it
is
a
basic
norm
of
professional
competence,
and
it
does
not
turn
on
professional
--
prevailing
professional
norms
in
publications
such
as
the
aba.
they
are
informative.
and
those
norms
can
evolve.
the
court
can
then
announce
sixth
amendment
applications
of
them
that
will
be
not
--
not
new
rules.
this
court
has
decided
close
to
30
strickland
cases,
according
to
our
count
since
the
1984
decision
in
strickland.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
say
no,
justice
scalia,
because
professional
norms
are
judged
as
of
the
time
of
the
attorney's
action.
so
although
the
professional
norms
can
evolve,
strickland
always
looks
to
an
actor
at
the
time
of
the
decision.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
you
probably
should
ask
my
opponent
what
he
contends,
but
strickland
is
fairly
clear
that
professional
norms
at
the
time
of
the
attorney's
action
are
what
govern.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
aba
doesn't
state
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
this
court
made
that
very
clear
in
roe
versus--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
breyer,
that's
not
what
the
court
did
in
padilla.
what
the
court
did
in
padilla,
as
justice
kagan
explained,
in
section
two
of
its
opinion
was
first
to
address
the
question
whether
a
criminal
defense
lawyer
had
any
obligation
to
give
advice
about
a
consequence
that
would
not
be
administered
in
the
criminal
case
itself.
no
decision
of
this
court
had
ever
held
that
the
obligations
of
a
criminal
defense
lawyer
under
the
sixth
amendment
extended
to
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision.
the
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--most
of
the
cases
involved
well-settled
duties,
like
the
duty
to
investigate,
applied
to
particular
sets
of
facts.
that
doesn't
generate
a
new
rule.
what
was
unique
in
padilla
is
that
the
court
had
to
address
something
that
it
had
never
done
before,
whether
the
criminal
defense
lawyer
had
to
give
advice
about
a
consequence
that
the
sentencing
court
had
no
control
over.
and
in
resolving
that
question,
this
court
did
not
cite
professional
norms.
it
did
not
cite
the
aba.
it
did
not
cite
any
of
the
defense
manuals
that
recommend
that
lawyers
advise
aliens
about
the
possibility
of
deportation.
it
instead
traced
the
statutory
evolution
of
the
relationship
between
deportation
and
criminal
justice,
it
examined
its
own
cases
that
had
discussed
what
a
competent
defense
lawyer
ought
to
think
about,
and
it
discussed
statutory
evolution.
and
it
drew
from
that
the
principle
that
deportation
is
uniquely
tied
to
the
criminal
prosecution
in
a
way
that
no
other
collateral
consequence
possibly
is,
and,
therefore,
the
court
did
not
decide
any
other
collateral
consequence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
common
sense
may
evolve--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
court
relied
on
the
idea
that
any
lawyer
worth
his
salt
would
inform
a
defendant
about
a
particularly
important
consequence,
a
momentous
consequence
of
pleading
guilty.
you
probably
would
say
the
same
thing
to
somebody
who
you
knew
was
an
avowed
hunter
and
would
lose
the
right
to
have
firearms,
or
a
politician
that
would
lose
the
right
to
hold
office,
or
a
doctor
who
would
lose
a
medical
license,
all
of
which
can
be
automatic
consequences
of
a
conviction;
actually,
more
automatic
than
deportation,
because
deportation
is
administered
by
a
separate
body,
oftentimes
by
a
separate
sovereign
that
has
discretion
whether
to
even
institute
deportation
proceedings.
and
so
the
fact
that
we
might
all
share
an
intuition
that
good
lawyers
should
advise
their
clients
about
the
panoply
of
consequences
that
they
will
experience
by
pleading
guilty,
the
reality
is
that
until
padilla,
the
court
had
never
veered
from
the
track
of
saying
the
lawyer's
duty
is
to
help
the
client
figure
out
what
his
odds
are
of
prevailing
at
trial,
what
the
sentencing
consequences
are,
whether
there
are
any
affirmative
defenses,
and
what
the
rights
are
that
the
client
would
give
up
by
pleading
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
ginsburg,
because
this
court
held
in
danforth
v.
minnesota
that
teague
is
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
habeas
statute.
it's
an
implied
delegation
to
the
court
to
frame
appropriate
rules
for
federal
collateral
review.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
danforth
made
clear
that
states
have
discretion
whether
to
adopt
teague-like
rules.
they
do
not
have
to.
they
can
allow
their
citizens
to
have
the
benefit
of
new
rules
in
state
convictions.
and
this
court
is
doing
nothing
other
than
honoring
the
state's
own
policy
choice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
kentucky
does
have
a
teague-type
rule,
but
the
kentucky
supreme
court
decided
the
issue
on
the
merits.
the
state
never
raised
teague
here.
teague
is
waivable.
so
even
if
you
do
not
agree
with
me,
justice
ginsburg,
that
danforth
means
that
teague
had
no
relevance
whatsoever,
teague
was
waived
by
the
state.
the
state
never
addressed
it.
and
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--could
have,
but
didn't.
there
is
nothing
in
the
majority
opinion
that
says
that
teague
is
an
issue.
now,
again,
when
i
say
could
have,
but
didn't,
that
reflects
the
reality
that
this
court
can
do
certain
things
sua
sponte.
i
do
not
think
that
in
a
case
coming
from
a
state
system
teague
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
whether
this
court
is
reviewing
the
case
on
direct
review
from
a
state
system
or
reviewing
a
state
collateral
proceeding,
teague
is
not
an
issue.
it's
solely
an
issue
when
you
have
a
2254
proceeding
or
a
2255
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
kennedy,
my
test
is
not
a
new
rule.
my
test
for
teague
new
rules
is
this
court's
test:
whether
the
decision
was
dictated
by
precedent
so
that
any
reasonable
jurist
would
have
reached
that
result,
or,
to
put
it
another
way,
that
no
reasonable
jurist
could
not
have.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
similar.
i
think
the
court
has
said
that
things
that
don't
count
as
new
rules
under
teague
can
also
be
cognizable
under
aedpa.
aedpa
has
a
contrary
to
provision,
as
well
as
an
unreasonable
application
provision,
as
mr.
fisher
pointed
out;
but,
as
far
as
the
contrary
to
provision
works,
it
parallels
teague.
so
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
make
any
new
rules
up
about
teague.
we're
asking
the
court
to
apply
teague.
and
in
the
application
of
teague,
the
government
is
relying
on
this
court's
form
of
analysis,
which
is
you
look
at
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
decision
in
question,
when
the
decision
became
final,
and
you
ask
whether
precedent
compelled
the
result
that
a
later
decision
reached.
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
court
has
not,
except
in
the
sense
that
in
bousley
v.
united
states,
the
court
ran
through
a
teague
analysis
before
holding
that
a
substantive
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute
is
not
captured
by
teague.
so,
in
that
sense,
the
court
has
presumed
the
applicability,
but
it
hasn't
squarely
held
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
true,
justice
ginsburg,
but
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
federal
courts
have
an
interest
in
the
finality
of
federal
convictions
that's
every
bit
as
strong
as
state
courts.
and
so,
for
example,
in
united
states
v.
frady,
the
court
applied
the
procedural
default
rule
exactly
the
same
as
it
applies
in
state
cases
to
federal
2255
proceedings.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
are
two
becauses.
one
is
no
court
had
held,
as
this
court
did
in
padilla,
that
deportation,
though
not
administered
by
the
sentencing
court,
was
so
intimately
tied
to
the
criminal
case
that
the
direct
collateral
distinction
was
not
useful
in
this
context.
there
was
no
precedent
that
dictated
that.
and
then,
more
generally,
as
you're
suggesting,
justice
kennedy,
the
lower
courts
had
all
adopted
the
direct
collateral
reviews.
ten
courts
of
appeals
in
published
decisions,
the
sixth
circuit
in
an
unpublished
decision,
28
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
had
all
adhered
to
that
line.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
not
suggest
that
the
court
adopt
a
mechanical
approach.
here,
all
of
the
factors
that
the
court
has
looked
at
all
align
in
the
same
direction.
the
lower
courts,
federal
courts,
had
all
agreed
that
deportation
was
not
the
subject
of
a
duty
of
advice.
the
majority
of
the
states
had
held
the
same.
this
court's
decision
in
padilla
was
significantly
splintered,
with
four
justices
challenging
the
majority's
rule
as
a
dramatic
expansion
and
upheaval
in
sixth
amendment
law.
and
then
when
you
actually
look
at
the
court's
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence,
padilla
did
not
claim
that
any
decision
was
controlling
of
its
holding.
the
closest
case
was
the
hill
case,
hill
v.
lockhart,
and
in
that
case
the
court
approached
a
collateral
consequence,
namely,
parole
eligibility
dates,
and
it
said:
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
issue
on
whether
parole
eligibility
dates
can
be
the
subject
of
a
strickland
claim,
because
hill
had
failed
to
show
prejudice.
and
therefore,
it
was
recognized
as
an
open
issue
whether
a
consequence
that's
not
administered
by
the
sentencing
court
could
be
within
strickland.
so
when
you
have
the
coalescence
of
all
of
those
factors,
i
don't
think
that's
a
case
where
the
court
has
to
draw
a
fine
line
between
when
a
sufficient
split
below
is
enough
to--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
let
me
give
you
a
merits
answer
to
that
question,
and
then
an
answer
on
why
i
do
not
think
petitioner
has
fairly
preserved
or
presented
that
issue
to
this
court.
the
merits
answer
is
that
teague
reflects
a
fundamental
judgment
that
when
a
case
is
final
on
its
direct
review,
society
has
a
strong
interest
in
protecting
that
judgment.
and
the
exception
to
that
is
when
the
state
or
the
federal
government
has
not
conformed
to
existing
constitutional
law.
now,
bringing
that
down
to
earth
for
ineffective
assistance
claims,
at
the
time
that
ms.
chaidez's
conviction
became
final,
and
all
convictions
that
became
final
before
padilla,
jurisdictions
had
no
reason
to
think
that
they
needed
to
protect
against
the
possibility
that
a
criminal
defense
lawyer
would
not
have
advised
about
deportation,
because
the
unanimous
view
was
that's
not
something
that's
the
sixth
amendment
duty.
immediately
after
padilla
came
down
reflecting
that
it
was,
the
criminal
rules
committee
began
considering
an
amendment
to
rule
11,
which
is
now
pending
before
the
judicial
conference,
that
would
require
judges
to
advise
defendants
about
the
possibility
of
deportation
consequences.
in
other
words--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
will
accept
that,
if
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
point
is
that
as
soon
as
padilla
made
it
clear
that
a
constitutional
rule
about
defense
counsel
could
threaten
the
finality
of
guilty
pleas,
the
rules
committee
has
taken
steps
to
protect
the
integrity
of
federal
judgments
through
a
rule
11
amendment.
it
had
no
opportunity
or
reason
to
do
that
--
i
can't
say
no
opportunity,
but
it
had
no
reason
to
do
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
until
the
court
decided
padilla.
and
so
there
is
a
logical
relationship
between--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
i--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
it's
quite
identical,
justice
breyer,
but
there
are
additional
considerations
that
are
at
stake
here,
too.
first
of
all,
massaro,
which
mr.
fisher
relies
on,
doesn't
preclude
a
defendant
from
raising
a
claim
on
direct
review.
it
says
that
it's
not
a
procedural
default
if
he
does
not
do
that.
a
criminal
defendant
will
probably
not
be
in
great
shape
to
raise
a
--
a
new
rule
claim
on
direct
review,
but
he
also
will
not
be
in
great
shape
to
raise
it
on
collateral
review.
unless
this
court
alters
its
sixth
amendment
holdings,
such
a
defendant
will
be
pro
se,
they
will
not
have
a
lawyer,
they
will
be
pretty
much
in
the
same
fix
that
they
are
in
on
direct
review.
now,
if
this
court
announces
that
new
rules
under
strickland
are
not
going
to
be
applied
to
defendants
whose
convictions
became
final,
then
those
defendants
who
want
to
raise
a
new
rule
claim
are
on
notice
that
they'll
need
to
do
it
on
direct
review.
courts
of
appeals
will
be
on
notice
that
if
someone
raises
such
a
claim,
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
adjudicate
it
or
remand
for
its
adjudication.
now,
right
now
the
d.c.
circuit
doesn't
follow
massaro.
it
does
remand
ineffective
assistance
claims.
mr.
fisher
said
he
was
unable
to
locate
any
cases
where
this
actually
happened.
you
don't
have
to
look
any
further
than
down
the
road
to
the
arguments
next
week
in
smith
v.
united
states,
which
involves
a
different
issue,
but
the
d.c.
circuit
remanded
an
effectiveness
claim
in
that
case
to
the
district
court
in
direct
review.
it
has
a
practice
of
doing
that.
this
is
actually
a
much
easier
process
to
administer
than
a
general
exception
to
massaro,
because--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
a
preferred
process
for
ineffectiveness
claims
generally.
i
think
massaro
makes
that
clear.
but
you
have
to
understand
how
rare
a
new
rule
under
strickland
really
is,
the
way
that
the
court
has
administered
strickland
to
date.
applications
of
the
existing
strickland
standard
to
particular
sets
of
facts
are
not
new
rules.
that's
why
in
the
28
years
since
strickland
none
of
this
court's
decisions,
and
there
are
about
30
of
them,
under
strickland
added
up
to
a
new
rule.
padilla
broke
ground
because
it
answered
the
question,
not
how
does
strickland
apply,
but
whether
it
applies
at
all
to
something
outside
the
compass
of
the
sentencing
court.
and
so
in
that
respect,
there's
no
reason
why
the
standard
practice
under
massaro
should
change
if
this
court
were
to
address
the
issue
and
make
clearer
that
new
rules
are
not
going
to
be
applied
on
collateral
review.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
could
be
something
more
than
that,
because
if
the
court
announces
a
new
rule
and
makes
it
retroactive
to
a
case
on
collateral
review,
(f)(3)
of
the
statute
of
limitations
provision
gives
the
defendant
another
1
year.
and
i
think
this
case
actually
illustrates
the
mischief
of
that.
this
case
doesn't
arise
on
collateral
review.
it
arises
on
coram
nobis
5
years
after
the
conviction
became
final.
now,
if
petitioner
were
really
serious
that
this
court
should
carve
out
from
teague
ineffectiveness
claims
and
adopt
a
rule
just
like
the
one
that
it
did
in
martinez
v.
ryan,
which
is
what
he
says
on
page
31
of
his
brief,
then
the
court
should
not
give
him
the
benefit
of
that
rule,
because
ms.
chaidez
was
on
probation
for
4
years
after
her
conviction,
she
could
have
raised
this
claim
after
her
conviction
and
sued.
she
did
not
do
that.
she
had
her
opportunity.
she
didn't
take
advantage
of
it.
and
i
think
this
helps
underscore
why,
if
i
can
turn
to
this
issue
not
being
properly
presented
in
the
court.
petitioner
did
not
raise
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
type
carve-out
from
teague
that
mr.
fisher
raises
in
this
case.
that
debuted
for
the
first
time
in
his
merits
brief
after
certiorari
was
granted.
the
government
acquiesced
to
get
resolution
of
the
new
rule
question
that
had
divided
the
circuits
and
that
will
exist.
however
this
court
resolves
this
case,
if
it
chooses
to
resolve
it
on
the
massaro
grounds,
the
new
rule
issue
will
still
be
salient
for
the
states,
it's
still
a
circuit
conflict
that
the
court
needs
to
address.
it
was
not
raised
below,
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
certiorari
petition.
the
en
banc
petition
raised
a
very
general
argument
that
teague
should
not
apply
to
federal
convictions
along
the
lines
of
what
justice
ginsburg
asked
me
about,
whether
comity
concerns
and
their
absence
meant
there
should
be
a
difference.
so
you've
got
an
argument
that,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
has
never
been
made
to
any
federal
court
before
it's
been
made
to
this
court,
and
it
would
be
remarkable
for
the
court
to
adopt
that
and
then
have
to
figure
out,
how
does
it
apply.
does
teague
ever
kick
in?
is
it
a
permanent
exemption
for
ineffective
assistance
claims?
lots
of
questions
that
no
lower
court
has
looked
at,
and
that
i
would
suggest
this
court
should
not
be
the
first
to
answer.
it
also
raises
an
entirely
new
set
of
questions
about
whether
brady
--
which
also
are
kinds
of
claims
that
are
typically
raised
on
collateral
review
--
should
now
be
exempt
from
teague
jurisprudence?
i
think
the
court
would
really
be
engaging
in
kind
of
a
sort
of
examination
of
teague
that
had
never
happened
before.
it's
sort
of
like
experimental
surgery
on
teague.
shouldn't
really
happen
in
this
court
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
true,
but
petitioner
is
not
pressing
that
basis
on
this
court.
he's
all
but
disavowed
it.
he's
not
seriously
argued
it
in
response
to
our
brief
that
opposed
his
brand
new
ineffectiveness
carveout
from
teague.
what
he
has
done
instead
is
concentrated
much
more
on
an
analogy
to
massaro.
if
i
could
give
one
more
reason
why
i
think
the
court
should
refrain
from
entertaining
that
massaro-based
analogy
here,
the
court
has
just
begun
to
embark
in
the
martinez
v.
ryan
line
of
cases
on
trying
to
figure
out
how
ineffectiveness
claims
should
be
handled
on
collateral
review.
it
grants
its
certiorari
on
monday
in
trevino
v.
thaler,
where
it's
going
to
explore
how
does
martinez
apply
in
a
jurisdiction
that
may
be
more
like
the
federal
system
in
that
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
aren't
channeled
only
to
direct
review,
they
can
be
asserted
on
direct
--
i'm
sorry
--
only
to
collateral
review,
they
can
be
asserted
on
direct
review.
they
are
channeled
largely
to
collateral
review,
but
not
as
a
matter
of
law.
so
the
court
has
a
lot
of
work
to
do
in
figuring
out
what
that
decision
means.
and
i
think
rather
than
embark
on
a
brand
new
process
of
applying
that
kind
of
reasoning
in
a
case
where
it
was
never
raised
below,
where
the
government
never
really
had
the
opportunity
to
counter
any
of
those
arguments,
and
the
lower
court
never
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
them,
it's
not
a
wise
use
of
the
court's
resources.
instead,
resolving
the
new
rule
question
that
has
divided
the
circuits
would
provide
an
answer
for
us
and
the
28
states
that
filed
an
amicus
brief
that
supported
the
united
states
on
the
new
rule
question,
and
would
result,
i
think,
appropriately,
in
concluding
that
padilla
was
a
new
rule,
unique
among
this
court's
strickland
jurisprudence
up
to
that
time,
and
is
not
available
to
cases
on
collateral
review.
