justice

alito,

if
a
court
--
if
this
court
were
to
decide
in
a
future
case
that
effective
assistance
of
counsel
requires
an
attorney
to
advise
the
client
of
all
collateral
consequences,
potential
loss
of
a
professional
license,
etc.
,
would
that
be
a
rule
that
was
dictated
by
precedent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
relevant
that
this
is
a
coram
nobis
proceeding,
rather
than
a
habeas
proceeding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
on
that
question,
before
you
--
not
in
relation
to
the
massaro
argument,
but
in
relation
to
the
teague
argument,
you
think
the
rule
in
coram
nobis
is
the
same,
that
the
teague
rule
applies
fully
in
coram
nobis
in
the
same
way
that
it
applies
in
habeas?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
have
we
ever
held
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
the
consequences
of
a
retroactive
application
in
coram
nobis
are
more
severe
than
they
are
in
habeas,
aren't
they,
because
of
the
lack
of
a
statute
of
limitations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
--
well,
in
--
under
--
under
the
current
federal
habeas
statute,
you
have
a
rather
short
statute
of
limitations
to
file
the
habeas
petition.
under
coram
nobis,
if
you
prevail,
then
people
who
were
--
who
were
convicted
of
offenses
decades
ago
can
raise
the
padilla
claim,
can
they
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
someone
--
if
there
is
an
attempt
to
--
a
notice
of
removal
for
someone
based
on
a
conviction
that
occurred
a
long
time
ago,
then
that
would
be--
