justice
elena
kagan
ms.
brenan,
can
i
ask
you
what
you
mean
by
a
plain
statement?
because
you've
said
a
couple
of
times
a
plain
statement
to
the
contrary.
justice
sotomayor
and
justice
alito
have
given
you
hypotheticals,
very
different
from
this
case,
but
hypotheticals,
where
there
is,
i
think,
a
strong
inference
that
there
was
no
adjudication
of
the
particular
federal
claim
alleged.
you
said
that's
not
a
plain
statement,
even
though
it
seems
as
though
there
is
a
strong
inference.
so
what
would
be
a
plain
statement?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
i
don't
know
why
they
would
say
that
either.
well,
by
the
way,
we're
not
adjudicating
this,
you
know.
so
if
that's
your
test,
your
test
is
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
go
back,
ms.
brenan,
to
your
basic
theory,
because
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
arguing
now.
in
your
brief,
you
talked
about
focusing
on
the
error.
so
if
evidence
was
admitted,
you
would
say
it
doesn't
matter
that
there
were
three
different
theories
for
why
the
admission
of
evidence
was
wrong;
you
should
just
look
at
the
fact
that
we're
talking
about
the
admission
of
evidence.
now,
is
that
what
you're
arguing,
or
are
you
also
saying
what
the
states
say
in
their
amicus
brief,
that
even
if,
you
know,
one
claim
is
about
the
admission
of
evidence,
and
one
claim
is
about
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
you
would
still
apply
the
same
rule?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
does
your
theory
make
any
sense?
i
mean,
we're
supposed
to
be
interpreting
a
statute
here
that
says
whether
the
claim
was
adjudicated
on
the
merits.
usually
when
we
speak
of
claims,
we
speak
of
legal
grounds
for
relief.
we
don't
look
at
a
claim
and
say,
we'll
just
check,
you
know,
what
--
we
don't
use
an
operative
facts
test,
and
you
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
that's
the
kind
of
test
we
should
use.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
may
be
just
repeating
some
of
my
colleagues
here,
but
i
think
if
you
take
this
opinion
at
face
value,
it
cuts
against
you.
i
mean,
it's
a
--
they're
applying
cleveland.
cleveland
is
a
constitutional
decision.
it's
a
federal
constitutional
decision.
the
concurrence
makes
that
completely
clear.
california
has
made
it
completely
clear
in
other
cases
post
cleveland
that
it
thinks
it's
applying
the
sixth
amendment.
whether
it's
applying
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
unclear,
but
it's
also
completely
irrelevant.
it
thinks
it's
applying
the
sixth
amendment,
and
it's
reaching
a
constitutional
judgment,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
you're
quite
right,
it
does
not
adopt
the
consensus
standard.
it
specifically
rejects
the
consensus
standard,
but
it's
entitled
to
do
that.
as
a
state
court,
with
no
supreme
court
decision
that
it
has
to
follow,
it
can
say,
we
have
a
different
view
of
the
sixth
amendment.
i'm
just
repeating
what
justice
alito
here
said.
and
that's
what
it's
doing.
it's
saying,
we're
applying
the
sixth
amendment,
we're
applying
it
differently
from
the
way
these
other
courts
have
done
so
because
we
think
they're
wrong.
