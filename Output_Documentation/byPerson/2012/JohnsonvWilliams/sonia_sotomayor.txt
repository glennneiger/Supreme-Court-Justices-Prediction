justice

what
happens
when
there
is
a
challenge
to
the
admission
of
evidence
on
a
state
law
ground
on
a
confrontation
clause
ground,
and
all
the
state
court
does
is
grapple
with
the
evidentiary
rule,
but
it's
self
evident
that
the
confrontation
clause
is
based
on
a
different
theory?
are
we
to
assume,
in
the
light
of
that
kind
of
decision,
that
the
court
actually
grappled
with
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
am
i
to
make
that
assumption
when,
before
our
line
of
cases
in
this
area,
state
courts
generally
had
held
that
if
hearsay
was
admissible
under
their
evidentiary
rules,
that
that
was
the
end
of
their
confrontation
clause
challenge?
is
a
federal
court
supposed
to
continue
with
that
presumption
in
light
of
an
undisputed
state's
statement
that
their
rules
are
consonant
with
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
let's
assume
it's
not
after
our
--
we
render
our
decision.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
one--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--irrebuttably?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
see
exceptions
to
that
already.
there
are
cases
where
the
state
court
reaches
one
prong
of
the
strickland
standard,
has
no
need
to
go
to
the
second.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
really
can't
say
in
that
situation
that
you
can
assume
they
reached
the
second,
can
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
of
the
circuit
courts
basically
have
a
rule
close
to
the
one
announced
by
justice
alito,
don't
they?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
of
them
have
essentially
a
presumption
that's
rebutted
by
some
form
of
evidence,
except
for
perhaps
the
eleventh
and
this
circuit
that
have
a
clear,
almost
irrebuttable
presumption.
i'm
sorry.
not
the
ninth,
but
the
eleventh.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
not
as
absolute
as
the
eleventh.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
a
--
you
know,
i
mean,
for
every
rule
you're
going
to
find
an
exception
that
abuses
it.
it's
the
nature
of
human
nature.
do
you
know
what
the
total
number
of
habeas
petitions
there
are
and
what
the
percentage
that
are
actually
granted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
be
willing
to
accept
that
it's
--
in
relationship
to
the
total
granted,
it's
very,
very
small?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
whatever
the
abuse
of
the
system
is,
it
hasn't
halted
justice.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
the
person
is
not
guilty
is
a
bias?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
--
that's
--
that
may
be
your
strongest
point,
but
most
of
what
he
said
was
basically
this
is
a
murder
case,
and
the
evidence
has
to
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
clear
enough
for
me
to
be
convinced.
is
that
a
biased
juror?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
must
say
that,
like
justice
kennedy,
i'm
deeply
troubled
when
trial
judges
intrude
in
the
deliberative
processes
of
juries.
most
of
the
time
when
we're
assessing
bias,
we're
assessing
it
on
the
grounds
of
extraneous
evidence,
a
juror
who
has
said
one
thing
in
voir
dire
and
is
now
either
a
convicted
felon
or
introduced
extraneous
circumstance.
but
the
degree
of
being
convinced
is
the
very
essence
of
jury
deliberations.
this
case
is
troublesome.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
how
you
can
say
that.
i
mean,
i
think
the
simplest
statement
of
the
state
rule
is
that
the
state
believes
that
if
you
remove
a
juror
for
actual
bias,
that
that
is
okay
under
the
sixth
amendment.
they
said
it
in
cleveland.
they
were
presented
with
the
argument
in
this
case
by
the
briefing
that
the
juror
was
not
biased
and
hence
the
sixth
amendment
was
violated.
and
they
ruled
to
say
he
was
biased,
and
i
see
as
a
natural,
clear
inference
that
they
were
saying
the
sixth
amendment
wasn't
violated
because
he
was
biased.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
different
question.
that
question
is
whether
the
california
supreme
court's
cleveland
decision,
its
assumption
that
a
biased
juror
violates
--
doesn't
violate
--
the
removal
of
a
biased
juror
doesn't
violate
the
sixth
amendment,
is
that
an
unreasonable
application
of
supreme
court
precedent,
not
circuit
court
precedent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
supreme
court
precedent
commands
that
result?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
this
--
is
this
a
holding
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
you
to
keep
a
biased
juror
as
long
as
the
juror
says,
i
have
doubts
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
answer
my
question.
does
the
sixth
amendment
require
you
to
keep
a
biased
juror?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so,
if
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
require
you
to
keep
a
biased
juror,
then
why
is
it
that
the
state
court's
finding
that
this
juror
was
biased
a
sixth
amendment
holding,
that
it
wasn't
violated
because
the
juror
was
biased?
the
logic
is
almost
inescapable
to
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
the
california
court
find
the
juror
was
biased?
