chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-465,
johnson
v.
williams.
ms.
brenan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals,
whose
decision
we're
reviewing,
understood
the
respondent
to
present
a
separate
state
claim
and
a
separate
federal
claim,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
the
predicate
to
the
whole
question
we
have
before
us,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
any
idea
based
on
your
experience
how
many
separate
claims
are
typically
raised
in
a
capital
case
of
this
sort?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hermansen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
the
way
you
phrased
it,
if
it
addresses
the
bulk
of
the
claims,
under
your
theory
it
has
to
address
every
claim,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
not
overlooked
or
omitted.
not
discussed.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
analyzed
in
the
opinion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
agree
that
if
--
this
was
raised
when
your
friend
was
at
the
lectern
--
if
the
court
at
the
end
said,
not
only
denied,
but
said,
i
considered
all
other
arguments
not
addressed,
denied,
then
you
have
no
case,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
not
willing
to
assume
that
when
the
judge
says
“
denied
”.
you're
willing
to
assume
that
when
the
judge
says:
i've
looked
at
everything,
denied.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
give
them
the
presumption
of
regularity
in
the
one
case
you
ought
to
give
it
to
them
in
the
other.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
discussion
you've
been
having
with
justice
sotomayor
and
justice
alito
highlights
another
problem
with
your
approach,
is
that
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
decide
in
every
case
whether
or
not
state
law
is
coterminous
with
federal
law.
and
there
was
--
i
don't
know
that
the
ninth
circuit
got
that
question
right
in
this
case
or
they
got
it
wrong,
but
in
every
case,
or
many
of
the
cases,
the
claim
will
be
made
on
the
part
of
the
state,
well,
yes,
they
just
said
state
law,
but
it's
the
same
as
federal
law.
and
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
that
as
an
exception
to
their
rule.
isn't
that
really
going
to
cause
all
sorts
of
collateral
litigation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
it's
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
except
in
a
case
like
harrington
v.
richter.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
brenan,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
in
case
no.
11-465,
johnson
vs.
williams.
