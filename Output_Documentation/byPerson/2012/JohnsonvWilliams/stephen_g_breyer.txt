justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
can't
they
just
do
what
we
used
to
do?
many
district
judges
do
this
and
--
because
there
are
sometimes
thousands
of
petitions
of
different
kinds.
a
lot
go
to
the
staff
attorneys
that
look
them
over
and
flag
the
arguments,
and
you
put
at
the
end,
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side:
any
other
arguments
that
are
made
are
rejected.
all
right.
now,
that
serves
one
purpose.
a
human
being
has
a
hard
time
writing
that
unless
he's
thinking:
i've
looked
this
over
pretty
carefully.
and
if
it's
a
staff
attorney
preparing
a
draft,
the
staff
attorney
doesn't
want
to
--
doesn't
want
to
write
those
words
unless
he
or
she
has
really
looked
with
some
care.
and
so
it
serves
a
purpose.
it
means
they
don't
do
it
just
as
a
form.
they
could
turn
it
into
a
form,
but
they
shouldn't.
and
so
--
let
them
write
that,
and
therefore
if
we
get
nothing
then
you
put
into
play
these
presumptions,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
anything.
judges
can
not
do
their
job.
but
--
but
when
you
write
something
like
the
word
“
denied
”,
which
is
all
most
district
judges
write
in
respect
to
many
motions,
they
read
the
motion,
they
think
about
it,
that's
their
job.
so
--
so,
similarly,
a
staff
attorney
or
a
judge
who
is
going
to
have
to
write
certain
words
will
want
to
do
his
job
or
her
job,
and
they
will
do
it.
so
i'm
just
suggesting
that
it
won't
--
that
isn't
a
big
deal.
now,
this
case,
they
didn't
write
that
for
some
reason.
many
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
minute,
please,
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
page
104(a).
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
most
of
it,
about
six
or
eight
pages,
recites
the
facts.
then
they
discuss
the
law.
the
legal
discussion
is
on
page
104(a).
it's
approximately
30
lines
long.
more
than
half
of
it
concerns
federal
law.
i
mean,
they
don't
just
cite
that
federal
case.
they
say,
"in
assessing
whether
a
juror
is
impartial
for
federal
constitutional
purposes
--
federal
constitutional
purposes
--
the
united
states
supreme
court
has
said.
"
da,
da,
da,
then
they
quote
it
all.
now,
since
your
argument,
the
argument
in
the
--
in
this
brief
here
is
entirely
sixth
amendment,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
they
say,
look,
look
what
happened
here,
they
took
this
man
off
the
jury.
that
violates
my
rights
to
sixth
amendment
right.
it
says
it
over
and
over
and
over.
i
have
no
doubt
you
raised
it.
and
now
they
give
an
answer.
and
the
answer
that
they
give
consists
of
30
lines,
and
16
of
the
lines
consist
of
federal
law.
so
--
so
what's
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
remaining
14
lines
do
consist
of
state
law
too;
but,
i
mean,
how
can
we
say
they
didn't
consider
the
federal
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
didn't
quote
--
nesler
doesn't.
what
they
did
in
nesler
is
quote
a
federal
case.
and
what
they
do
here
is
not
just
say
nesler,
they
quote
the
federal
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
it
doesn't.
maybe
they
didn't
properly
--
maybe
they
didn't
properly
state
what
federal
law
is.
everybody
has
some
concerns
about
that
one.
but
what
i
don't
see
is
how
when
they
spend
14
out
of
27
lines
quoting
a
federal
case
which
they
believe
sets
the
standard
for
impartiality
and
partiality
you
can
say
that
they
didn't
discuss
the
federal
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
constitutional
purposes.
and
this
guy
was
kicked
off
the
jury
because
they
thought
he
was
not
impartial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
your
claim
over
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
that
they
didn't
consider
it,
but
that,
rather,
they
considered
it,
but
no
reasonable
juror
could
reach
--
no
reasonable
jurist
could
reach
the
conclusion
that
they
reached
on
the
issue.
that
argument
is
open
to
you.
the
only
thing
i
don't
understand
is
how
you're
saying
--
or
everybody
--
i
must
be
wrong,
because
everybody
seems
to
be
saying
it
--
that
they
didn't
reach
the
federal
issue
when
they
spent
14
lines
discussing
it,
rightly
or
wrongly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
happens
to
be
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
now,
what
the
court
says
about
that
argument,
what
the
court
of
appeals
says,
is
that
the
argument
of
your
client
not
only
misstates
the
evidence
--
that's
their
--
not
you,
but
they're
criticizing
--
and
then
he
says,
"it
ignores
the
trial
court's
explanation
that
it
was
discharging
juror
no.
6
because
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
biased.
"
so
this
court
of
appeals
thinks
the
issue
is
whether
he
had
shown
sufficient
bias.
you
think
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
no.
the
government
thinks
it's
yes.
and
i
can
understand
the
differences
of
opinion,
but
i'm
back
to
my
question.
it
seems
to
me
in
14
lines
they
do
address
the
federal
constitutional
question
of
bias.
and
that's
--
that's
--
maybe
it
wasn't
the
right
issue,
et
cetera,
but
--
or
maybe
they
didn't
decide
it
correctly.
but
you
see
what's
bothering
me.
and
so
i've
listened
to
the
answer.
do
you
want
to
add
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
was
one
of
the
things.
then
they
go
through
in
those
four
pages
about
six
other
--
they
called
--
he
gave
one
story
to
the
judge,
juror
no.
6.
then
the
prosecution
calls
about
eight
other
jurors,
and
they
come
up
with
quite
a
different
story
about
what
he
was
telling
them
in
the
jury
room
and
--
that
i'm
not
going
to
convict
him.
well,
he
didn't
quite
say
that;
he
was
talking
about
vietnam
and
talking
about
the
slaves,
and
you
don't
want
to
convict
a
person
for
--
make
him
return
the
slave.
i
mean,
they
talked
about
a
lot
of
things.
and
he
went
through
all
that,
and
then
concludes
he
was
biased.
and
your
point
was
he
wasn't
biased.
he
was
going
to
decide
it
fairly.
okay,
i'm
listening.
