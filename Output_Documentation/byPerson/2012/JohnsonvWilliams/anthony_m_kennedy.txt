justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
can
continue
and
probably
should
talk
about
this
broad
theory
that
you
want
us
to
adopt.
really,
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
in
--
in
the
state
system
cited
nesler,
and
nesler
in
turn
cited,
at
page
104
of
the
petition
appendix,
a
supreme
court
case
you
don't
even
--
you
say
citation,
you
don't
even
give
--
but
it
--
it's
--
it's
the
supreme
court
case,
united
states
v.
wood,
written
by
chief
justice
charles
evans
hughes.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
very
clearly
ties
its
state
analysis
to
the
federal
constitution
and
a
sixth
amendment
discussion
in
wood.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
--
you
have
a
very
strong
argument
that
they
did
adjudicate
the
federal
claim
anyway.
i
know
you
want
us
to
maybe
reach
the
bigger
issue,
but
--
and
your
brief
almost
downplays
it
--
but
it
seems
to
me
pretty
clear
that
you
have
the
argument,
that
you
don't
strongly
make,
although
you
don't,
by
any
means,
abandon
it,
that
--
that
here
the
state
law
was
tied
to
the
federal
standard,
and
the
federal
standard
was
the
basis
for
the
entire
jurisprudence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
the
broader
rule,
if
you
took
$28.52
out
of
the
state's
judicial
budget
and
bought
them
all
a
stamp
which
just
says,
we
have
considered
and
rejected
all
constitutional
claims,
then
there
would
be
no
problem?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
have
to
--
i
mean,
this
takes
us
into
the
merits,
which
is
really
interesting,
but
i
--
we
probably
shouldn't
go
there,
but,
as
long
as
we're
there
for
a
minute,
i
agree
with
justice
ginsburg.
i've
never
seen
a
procedure
like
this.
and
i
looked
--
i
looked
at
this
--
the
federal
cases,
brown
and
thomas,
that
the
cleveland
court
cited.
those
--
and
wood
was
voir
dire,
was
not
mid-jury.
i
just
hope
this
doesn't
happen
with
much
regularity.
and
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
is
upset,
that's
the
reason
that
you
should
leave
the
jury
alone,
it
seems
to
me.
i
think
it's
very
troublesome.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
again
this
is
fact-specific
to
the
case.
it
doesn't
address
the
rule
that
we
want
to
address
and
was
the
reason
for
us
taking
the
case,
but
104a,
the
state
court,
state
appellate
court,
cites
the
united
states
v.
wood,
and
--
and
it
also
cites
cleveland,
and
cleveland
had
three
circuit
court
cases,
all
of
which
involved
the
sixth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
constitutional
claim
was
intertwined
with
and
controlling
of
the
procedural
matters
that
the
court
discussed.
i
just
don't
see
the
case
is
here
even
on
your
theory.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
--
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
reasonable
reading
of
cleveland
that
we're
adopting
this
rule,
this
is
our
state
rule,
it's
based
on
a
very
broadly
worded
state
statute,
it
is
informed
by
our
understanding
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
we
disagree.
we
mention
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
decisions
on
this
issue
and
we
respectfully
disagree
with
their
interpretation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
