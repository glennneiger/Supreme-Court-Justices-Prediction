mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
rule
this
court
should
adopt
is
the
same
rule
that
the
consensus
--
the
consensus
rule
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
when
they
look
at
an
opinion,
a
reasoned
opinion,
they
look
at
what
the
opinion
says,
the
text
of
the
opinion.
and
if
the
opinion
grapples
with
the
bulk
of
the
claims
that
are
in
the
prisoner's
appellate
brief
but
omits
to
address
one
of
the
claims,
then
there
is
an
inference
that
the
claim
has
not
been
adjudicated
on
the
merits.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
if
--
under
my
theory,
if
there
is
a
federal
claim
that's
overlooked
or
omitted,
then
the
inference--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--correct.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
correct.
here
it's
sixth
amendment,
so
the
sixth
amendment
was
not
mentioned.
the
sixth
amendment
was
not
--
there
is
no
indication
from
the
opinion
itself
that
the
sixth
amendment
claim
was
adjudicated.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
correct.
and
that's
the
recommendation
of
the
nacdl
brief.
and
we
do
see
that
a
lot.
there
is
--
where
there
are
opinions
that
say:
we've
reviewed
and
considered
all
claims
raised
and
reject
them.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
well,
justice
ginsburg,
as
justice
breyer
was
saying,
we,
and
as
my
friend
was
arguing,
you
know,
there
is
regularity
and
we
do
--
it's
fair
to
assume
that
a
judge
who
is
looking
at
an
appellate
court
brief
is
going
to
do
their
job
and
look
at
the
briefs.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
right--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--and
i
don't
think
the
presumption
of
regularity
should
apply
here,
just
as
this
court
in
smith
v.
digmon
looked
at
the
opinion
and
looked
at
what
was
argued
and
said:
all
the
courts
below
made
a
mistake;
it
was
fairly
exhausted.
and
i
would
like
to
address
justice
scalia's
concern
about
the
whole
area
of
litigation
that
might
occur.
that
won't
happen
for
one
reason:
in
the
habeas
context
the
claim
must
be
fairly
presented,
period.
if
the
federal
constitutional
claim
is
not
fairly
presented,
you're
not
in
federal
court.
and
so
there
is
already
a
whole
body
of
law
talking
about
what
a
claim
is.
and
my
friend
tries
to
avoid
the
word
“
claim
”
because
it's
inconvenient.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
it
was
fairly--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
it
was
fairly
presented.
and
in
the
red
brief
at
page
39
i
talk
about
that,
and
also
at
page
43
of
the
red
brief
i
indicate
that
the
attorney
general
conceded
that
the
claim
was
exhausted.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
justice
kennedy,
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
up
because
i
do
want
to
address
your
concern
on
that,
and
it's
dye
--
this
court's
opinion
in
dye
takes
care
of
the
intertwined
argument.
in
dye
this
court
said
that
as
long
as
the
claim,
the
federal
nature
of
the
claim
is
presented,
even
if
it's
presented
under
the
same
heading,
it's
fairly
presented
on
a
habeas
claim.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
if
that
were
the
case,
then
we
would
have
a
different
case.
but
in
cleveland
the
california
supreme
court
explicitly
rejected
or
declined
to
adopt
the
brown,
symington,
thomas--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--they
were
not.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
correct.
so
if
the
--
if
cleveland
were
to
come
before
this
court,
then
there
would
be
a
clear
indication
from
the
opinion
that
they
had
considered
the
federal
standard,
but
didn't
adopt
it.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
but
this
case
isn't
cleveland.
in
this
case
what
happened
was--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--there
--
the
problem
with
that
determination
is
that
there's
the
federal
standard
on
what
is
--
what
the
sixth
amendment
standard
is.
so
under
thomas,
symington
and
brown--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--this
gets
to
the
--
my
friend's
argument
about
how
their
argument
is
upside
down.
they
are
saying
that
we're
trying
to
incorporate
into
2254(d)(1)
what
is
contrary
to
and
what
is
the
united
states
supreme
court
law,
but
we
never
get
to
(d)(1)'s
united
states
supreme
court
law
limitation
because,
looking
at
the
text
of
2254(d),
you
start
with
was
the
claim
adjudicated
on
the
merits.
that's
the
threshold
question.
so
if
the
claim
was
not
adjudicated
on
the
merits
you
don't
get
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
law
limitation.
instead--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--instead
you
look
at
brown,
thomas,
and
symington,
and
they
say
that
if
the
juror's
views
on
the
merits
of
the
case
have
been
expressed
and
the
juror
might
be
kicked
off
because
of
--
which
is
exactly
what
happened
here
--
kicked
off
because
of
his
views
on
the
case,
then
the
sixth
amendment
has
been
violated.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
supreme
court
precedent
doesn't
command
it,
but
because
it's
de
novo
review
and
because
--
because
it's
a
quid
pro
quo.
2254(d),
congress
said
states
are
going
to
get
deference
and
they
are
going
to
get
a
limitation
on
the
law
that
the
federal
courts
can
look
at,
the
united
states
supreme
court
law.
but
for
that
quid
pro
quo
to
happen,
for
the
states
to
get
that
deference
and
limitation
on
the
law,
they
have
to
have
adjudicated
the
claim.
because
that's--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--the
main
event
is
supposed
to
be
in
state
court.
that
is
where
the
bite
of
the
apple
is
supposed
to
be,
in
state
court.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
and
it's
not
because
this
is
the
rare
case--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--i'm
sorry.
it's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
is
a
rare
case
where,
looking
at
the
opinion,
we
can't
tell
if
they
adjudicated
the
claim
on
the
merits.
and
it
appears,
every
appearance
and
inference
is
that
they
overlooked
it
or
didn't
adjudicate
it.
so
that's
a
rare
case.
normally,
just
looking
at
the
opinion
you
can
tell
if
they
adjudicated
the
federal
claim.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
harrington
v.
richter
created
a
very
simple,
straightforward,
and
appropriate
presumption,
because
when
you
have
a
unexplained
order
it
makes
sense
that,
in
that
context,
that
they
have
adjudicated
everything
on
the
merits.
and
to
give
the
greatest
respect
to
the
state
courts
in
comity
and
federalism
is
to
look
at
what
the
order
says,
and
if
it's
a
reasoned
opinion
to
take
it
at
face
value.
it
says
what
it
says;
it
doesn't
say
what
it
doesn't
say.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
no,
your
honor.
cleveland
--
a
careful
reading
of
cleveland
shows
that
the
majority
does
not
adopt
the
federal
standard.
so
the
consensus
standard
in
the
--
in
the
federal
circuit
courts
is
that
if
the
merits
of--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--and
so
two
points
on
that.
first,
is
the
concurrent
chides
the
majority
for
not
being
concerned
about
the
sixth
amendment.
the
second
is
the
--
my
friend
cites
people
v.
allen
with
an
ellipse
and
doesn't
give
the
full
context
of
allen.
so
when
they
cite
more
recent
law,
2006,
that
talks
about
how
the
demonstrable
reality
test,
which
is
just
a
notch
up
above
substantial
evidence,
is
designed
to
protect
constitutional
rights
of
due
process
and
sixth
amendment,
what
they
don't
say
is
in
people
v.
allen,
they
only
reached
the
statutory
issue,
they
never
reached
the
constitutional
issue.
so,
at
most,
it's
dicta.
and
the
california
supreme
court
has
never
held
--
has
never
addressed
the
issue
of
when
is
the
sixth
amendment
violated
when
a
juror
is
kicked
off
in
this
fashion?
and
instead,
they
--
their
role
is
we
allow
free
intrusion
into
the
deliberative
process.
we
don't
adopt
symington
and
brown
and
thomas
when
they
say
that
--
when
a
juror's
views
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
questioning
should
stop.
instead,
we
think
that
questioning
should
--
should
be
free
to
continue.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
section
1089
--
i
don't--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--in
people
v.
collins,
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
1089
is
a
rule
of
efficiency
so
that
courts
can
efficiently
deal
with
possible
juror
bias.
and
that
--
that's
still
good
law.
that
hasn't
changed.
so
that's
why
justice
werdegar,
in
her
concurrence,
was
saying,
we
need
to
be
worried
about
the
sixth
amendment.
and
the
only
reason
she
joined
in
the
opinion
was
it
used
to
be,
well,
if
there's
just
substantial
evidence
that
the
juror
is
not
deliberating
as
a
juror
should,
she
wasn't
satisfied
that
that
was
sufficient;
but,
because
there
had
to
be
a
demonstrable
reality
from
the
record
that
the
juror
wasn't
deliberating,
she
signed
on
in
cleveland.
and
in
cleveland,
they
reversed
under
1089.
and
this
case
should
have
been
reversed
under
1089.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
the
problem--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--because
nesler
doesn't
talk
one
iota
about
kicking
off
the
holdout
juror.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
and
that
federal
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
kicking
off
a
holdout
juror.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
you
hit
the
nail
right
on
the
head,
justice
breyer,
because
they
are
taking
about
impartiality.
that's
all
they're
talking
about.
they're
looking
at
a
federal
case
to
see
what
the
definition
of
impartiality
is.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
the
bottom
line
is
they
did
not
apply
the
federal
rule.
and
the
federal
rule
is
that
if
the
juror's
views
on
the
merits
of
the
case
have
been
revealed,
then
the
juror
should
not
be
kicked
off.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
respectfully,
justice
breyer,
they
don't
--
they're
just
talking
about
a
definition
of
one
word,
of
what
actual
bias
is.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
the
issue
in
this
case
is
can
you
kick
off
a
juror
who
has
expressed
10
or
15
times
--
and
this
came
out
right
out
of
the
bat
--
the
foreperson
was
called
out,
asked
about
some
notes
and
said,
juror
no.
6,
10
or
15
times
has
said,
i
don't
think
there's
sufficient
evidence.
so
that's
different
from
whether
we
look
at
federal
law
to
--
for
the
definition
of
actual
bias.
my
--
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
position
to
say
that
you
can't
infer
from
this
discussion
of
nesler,
only
talking
about
what
the
definition
of
actual
bias
is,
that
the
actual
sixth
amendment
claim
--
and
even
the
trial
attorney
was
arguing
in
symington,
your
honor,
please
don't
question
these
jurors.
the
foreperson,
right
out
of
the
box
said
that
juror
no.
6,
10
or
15
times,
has
already
said
that
he
thinks
there
isn't
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
i
would
respectfully
request
that,
read
--
that
reading
this
whole
thing
in
context,
it's
clear
that
the
california
court
of
appeals
is
dealing
with
1089.
they
are
not
dealing
with
the
federal
standard
that
we're
grappling
with
here,
which
is
if
a
juror's
views
on
the
merits
of
a
case
have
been
expressed,
can
you
then
interrogate
all
the
jurors--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--no.
if
there
is
good
cause--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--no.
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
yeah,
right.
so
for
a
minute
we'll
get
into
the
issue
that
wasn't
certified,
but
what
happened
in
this
case
was
the
judge
--
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
the
finding
of
bias
wasn't
good
cause
under
the
federal
standard
because
the--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--yes.
because
he
was
applying
too
high
of
a
standard
because
he
said
very
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
there
was
a
quibble
about
what
does
the
word
very
add
to
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
the
jury
very
eloquently
responded
that
very
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
the
same
as
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
so
that
doesn't
show
bias
when
someone--
mr.
kurt
d.
hermansen
--but
the
threshold
issue
is
when
the
foreperson,
at
the
very,
very,
very
beginning,
says,
juror
no.
6,
10
or
15
times
has
said
he
doesn't
think
there
is
sufficient
evidence,
all
questioning
should
have
stopped
at
that
point,
because
there
was
no
indication
of
bias.
but
--
and
how
do
we
know
that
there's
a
possibility
that
he's
being
kicked
off
because
of
his
views
on
the
merits
of
the
case?
we
know
that
because
the
prosecutor
filed
a
motion
saying,
let's
reopen
questioning.
and
that
--
then
the
judge
said,
okay,
yeah,
let's
reopen
questioning.
but
the
foreman
had
already
said,
i
think
your
response
to
the
jury
note
has
satisfied
that;
i
think
it
will
be
fine.
yet,
the
prosecutor
filed
a
motion
to
reopen
because
the
prosecutor
knew
that
this
juror
had
reasonable
doubts.
and
so
that's
why
there's
clear
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
juror
was
based
on
the
juror's
views
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
and
--
and,
also,
this
is
not
a
capital
case,
it's
just
a
--
an
lwop
case.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
