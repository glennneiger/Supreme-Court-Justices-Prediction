ms.
brenan,
we
are
straying
pretty
far
from
this
case.
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but,
as
i
understand
it,
the
argument
was
made
under
state
law,
and
then
williams
said
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
under
state
law
and
therefore
the
sixth
amendment
was
violated.
so
there
really
isn't
any
independent
--
williams
hasn't
stated
any
independent
sixth
amendment
right.
it's
state
law
was
violated
and
therefore
the
constitution
was
violated.
so
it
seems
to
me
if
we
just
look
at
the
position
that
williams
was
taking,
that
these
two,
the
state
and
the
federal
claim,
are
tied
--
tied
together.
and
we
don't
--
to
go
beyond
this
case
and
imagine
some
other
case
that
might
come
before
us
some
day
would
not
be
wise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
about
the
underlying
claim
here?
it
is
quite
troublesome.
i
think
this
is
a
state
that
doesn't
allow
an
allen
charge;
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
possibility
of
getting
rid
of
the
juror,
the
hold-out
juror,
in
this
way
is
--
is
really
troublesome.
the
judge
can't
give
an
allen
charge
to
urge
the
jury
to
deliberate
further,
but
can
say
--
now,
the
judge
knows
who
the
hold-out
is,
and
to
just
dismiss
that
juror,
it
is
--
it
is
very
troublesome.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
would
mean
that
if
you
prevail
it
would
just
become
routine.
justice
kennedy
mentioned
the
stamp
that
says:
we
considered
all
of
the
questions
raised,
those
not
discussed
on
the
merits--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
it
fairly
presented
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
given
that
the
argument
was
abuse
of
discretion?
