well,
i
assume
that
in
--
in
many
cases,
especially
capital
cases,
one
could
argue
for
years
over
whether
--
whether,
in
fact,
there
was
enough
indication
that
the
court
did
not
consider
it
or
not,
right?
and
every
year
is
a
reduction
of
sentence,
so
to
speak.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
would
be
a
lot
of
good
debate
over
whether
it
was
presented
clearly
enough,
is
presenting
it
in
two
sentences
enough
to
require
the
court
to
answer
it.
i
can
see
a
whole
--
you
know,
a
whole
train
of
litigation
on
this
wonderful
subject,
a
whole
new
area
of
law.
has
the
--
has
the
state
supreme
court
overlooked
something
that
was
clearly
enough
presented,
and
is
there
enough
indication
that
the
state
court
has
overlooked
it?
i
mean
--
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
word
denied
at
the
end
of
the
order
say
the
same
thing?
we've
considered--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
of
the
points
made,
and
we
have
denied
them.
and
wouldn't
it
be
the
case
that
if
you
require
such
a
statement,
but
you
have
a
situation
where
a
federal
question
occupies
90
percent
of
the
brief,
and
the
court
only
addresses
explicitly
the
state
things,
the
state
claims,
and
then
at
the
very
end
says,
we
have
considered
all
the
other
claims,
presumably
including
the
90
percent
federal
claims
that
are
not
addressed,
would
we
be
out
of
the
woods,
or
would
you
be
here
again
arguing
the
same
problem?
