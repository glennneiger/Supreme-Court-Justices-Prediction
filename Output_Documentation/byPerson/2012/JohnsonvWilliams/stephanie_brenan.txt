ms.
stephanie
brenan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
fairly
presented
claim
has
been
adjudicated
on
the
merits
when
a
state
court
issues
a
decision
denying
relief
unless
it
has
made
a
plain
statement
to
the
contrary.
and
this
is
especially
true
where
the
state
court
has
grappled
with
the
substance
of
the
alleged
error.
and
this
rule
is
correct
for
three
reasons:
first,
state
courts
discharge
their
duties.
they
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution.
therefore,
they
must
adjudicate
claims
that
--
that
allege
constitutional
violations.
so
when
a
state
court
issues
a
decision
denying
relief,
it
must
necessarily
have
considered
and
rejected
all
of
the
claims.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
your
honor,
we
would
assume
that
there
the
state
court,
through
its
denial
of
relief,
did
adjudicate
the
presented
confrontation
clause
claim.
and
that
would
be
because
--
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
the
presumption
of
regularity
that
judicial
officers
do
do
their
job,
and
it
can
only
be
rebutted
by
clear
evidence.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
in
that
situation,
if
the
state
court
rule
was
consonant
with
the
confrontation
clause,
we
would
have
certainly
an
adjudication
of
the
confrontation
clause.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
and
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
different,
we
would
still
hold
that
in
that
situation,
as
this
court
--
in
relying
on
richter,
in
that
situation
it
would
be
more
of
a
summary
denial
on
the
confrontation
analysis.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
yes,
your
honor,
we
agree
that
in
our
situation
it
just
so
happened
to
be
that
the
state
standard
also
encompassed
this
court's
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
because
it
was
citing
u.s.
v.
wood,
and
it
was
citing
smith
v.
phillips
among
the
--
the
sixth
amendment
cases.
in
our
case,
it
just
so
happens
that
it
does.
but
we
posit
also
that
our
case
shows
why
this
is
illustrative
as
to
why
this
court
should
adopt
the
broader
rule
that,
in
situations
where
a
state
court
has
denied
relief
or
a
claim
has
been
fairly
presented,
that
this
court
and
all
federal
courts
should
assume
that
the
state
courts
did
their
job
by
adjudicating
claims--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--your
honor,
in
--
we
have
suggested
that
--
that
it
can
be
rebutted
by
a
plain
statement,
if
the
state
court
says
that
it
is
not
reaching
it
or,
more
particularly,
if
a
state
court
imposes
a
procedural
bar.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
yes--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--well,
your
honor,
i
posit
that
those
strickland
cases
are
different.
and
they
are
different
because
in
all
of
those
cases
of
wiggins
v.
smith
and
rompilla,
that
there
the
courts
--
what
the
state
court
did
was
follow
exactly
what
this
court
has
said
of
how
a
strickland
claim
may
be
answered
entirely
by
only
addressing
the
one
prong
of
strickland.
and
so
there
they're
doing
exactly
adjudicating
everything
through
the
analysis
of
one.
additionally,
in
those
cases,
by
doing
so,
the
courts
are
not
in
any
way
suggesting
that
the
state
courts
failed
to
do
something.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
yes,
your
honor,
i
completely
agree
with
the
view
that
here
williams
did
present
a
completely
dependent
federal
claim;
and,
therefore,
the
state's
analysis
--
the
state
court's
analysis
would
have
fully
adjudicated
that.
however,
we
suggest
that
this
case
does
illustrate
why
that
broader
rule
is
important.
and
it's
important
because,
otherwise,
other
federal
courts
may
not
view
it
as
this
court
did,
seeing
it
as
a
dependent
claim--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
exactly,
your
honor.
so--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--yes,
your
honor,
in
that
situation
we
would.
one,
because
of
the
presumption
of
regularity;
two,
because
of
what
this
court
has
said
in
richter,
where
we
could
view
it
as
a
summary
denial;
and,
third,
what
underlies
that
is
that
if
it's
not
written
in
the
opinion,
that
it
has
been
ignored.
but
that's
not
what
this
court
said
in
castillo,
where
it
said,
if
a
court
chooses
to
ignore
in
its
opinion,
which
should
be
read
as
in
its
opinion
writing,
means
that
that
claim
has
been
impliedly
rejected.
so,
therefore,
just
because
a
state
court
chooses
not
to
write
about
it
in
its
opinion
does
not
mean
that
it
didn't
consider
and
reject
that
claim.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
sure,
your
honor,
but
the
reason
why
there
should
be
a
plain
statement
is
because
it's
long
been
held
that
in
order
to
rebut
that
presumption
of
regularity,
you
need
clear
evidence.
and,
really,
the
only
clear
evidence
that
one
could
have
would
be
a
plain
statement.
and
this
court
reinforced
that
when
it
said
in
richter,
it
talked
about
an
indication
or
other
state
procedural
bars,
and
it
cited
harris
v.
reed.
and
harris
v.
reed
is
a
case
that
talked
about
plain
statements.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
exactly,
your
honor.
and
that's
--
that's
why
having
a
broader
rule
with
this
presumption--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--your
honor,
they
really
do
that
when
they
say
“
affirmed
”
at
the
end
of
the
decision.
it
really
adds
nothing.
if
it
were
a
stamp,
it
would
be
merely
reflexive,
and
therefore
would
in
the
end
give
you
no
indication
whether
an
argument
had
been
considered
or
not.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
if
--
this
was
not
a
capital
case--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--but
an
lwop
case.
however,
in
a
capital
case
there
can
be
hundreds.
and
we
--
or
hundreds
of
pages
of
documents
--
or
hundreds
of
pages
in
an
appellant's
opening
brief,
and,
therefore,
if
one
were
to
slip
in,
in
a
phrase
an
apparent
claim,
and
that
the
state
court
happens
to--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--your
honor,
if
they
happen
not
to
mention
one
particular
claim?
ms.
stephanie
brenan
the
eleventh
circuit
and,
i
believe,
the
sixth
circuit
as
well.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
true
that
the
eleventh
circuit
has
a
broader
rule.
and
we
believe--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--i
don't
have
that
figure
off
the
top
of
my
head,
your
honor.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
yes,
i
believe
that
is
true,
that
there
is
a
small
number
of
granting
of
petitions,
yes.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
well,
your
honor,
the
thing
is
that
--
and
i
think
that
justice
scalia
has
adverted
to
this
--
is
that
if
we
were
to
require
only
an
indication,
it
would
create
a
situation
where
there
would
be
all
this
litigation.
and
that's
why
this
court,
when
it
does
--
has
accepted
conclusive
presumptions
in
other
cases,
for
example
in
coleman
v.
thompson,
talked
about
we
will
accept
these
conclusive
presumptions
because
they
work
in
almost
all
of
the
cases,
and
we
will
accept
the
small
number
of
errors
in
exchange
for
the
reduction
in
workload.
so--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--justice
breyer,
i
would
disagree
with
--
with
that
proposal
because
it
is
in
the
end
just
--
could
become
reflexive--
ms.
stephanie
brenan
--no.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
i
think
we
could
be
arguing
the
same
problem.
i
think,
as
your
honor's
noted,
that
the
inclusion
of
the
word
denied,
or,
if
you're
affirming
a
conviction
in
a
direct
appeal,
the
word
affirmed
covers
that.
it
says
exactly,
we
have
considered
all
those
other
claims.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
a
plain
statement
would
be
a
procedural
bar,
or
if
there
were
--
a
court
were
to
say,
we're
not,
for
some
reason,
going
the
reach
the
constitutional
claim,
that
they
really
need
to
say
it
out
loud.
i
don't
know
why
they
would
say
that,
but
that's
what
would
be
required.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
no,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree,
because
there
is
the
possibility
of
having
--
having
the
procedural
bar.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
i
would
say
that
it
possibly
could
be
if
it
were
in
that
situation.
however,
i
would
--
i
would
still
go
back
to,
really,
the
richter
presumption
of
saying
that
that
word
at
the
end,
denied,
denied
is
denied
is
denied,
and
it
covers
every
fairly
presented
claim.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
possibly
it
could
be,
your
honor,
but
here
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
that
situation.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
correct.
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
well,
your
honor,
the
thing
is
that
here
we
have
a
trial
court
who
is
looking
at
this
juror
and
makes
the
determination
that
the
juror
is
biased.
and,
therefore,
if
there
was
to
be
anything
of
any
sort
of
constitutional
violation,
it
would
be
the
keeping
that
juror,
a
biased
juror,
on
the
jury.
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
well,
justice
kennedy,
it's
a
situation
where,
through
the
voir
dire,
what
comes
out
is
not
that
we're
trying
to
get
--
that
the
trial
judge
is
feeling
to
get
rid
of
this
juror
because
he's
the
hold-out
juror,
but
it's
because
through
the
voir
dire
he
determines
that
this
juror
is
biased,
and
that
is
the
bias,
and
that's
what
makes
it
different.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
no,
your
honor,
that's
certainly
not
it.
the
bias
comes
from
what
he
was
saying
of
his
disagreement
or
--
that
he
just
really
did
not
believe
with
the
felony
murder
rule.
therefore,
it's
that
--
that
under
any
evidence,
whatever
evidence
was
presented,
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
convict
because
he
disagreed
with
the
very
basis
of
the
law.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
that
is
not
a
biased
juror,
but
that's
what
he
said
to
the
court.
but
what
comes
out
through
the
voir
dire
of
the
other
jurors
is
not
that
he
was
using
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
but
that
he
was
using
a
no
doubt
standard,
an
absolute
doubt
standard.
and
that's
where
he's
not
following
the
law,
and
that's
where
he's
biased.
and
that's
where
he
becomes
a
biased
juror
who
has
no
right
to
be
on
that
jury.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
in
this
situation
it's
one
where
the
judge
was
presented
with
possible
misconduct,
and
therefore
had
to
do
something.
had
the
judge
done
nothing,
we
could
have
possibly
been
in
the
same
situation.
and
under
--
under
california
law,
it's
where
this
--
this
examination
cannot
be
so
intrusive.
so
we
maintain
that
it
was
not.
it
was
only
to
the
degree
in
which
we
are
finding
that
there
was
a
biased
juror.
at
that
point
in
time,
the
sixth
amendment
required
that
that
juror
be
removed.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
what
we're
saying
is
that,
at
the
very
least,
in
our
type
of
situation
where
--
where
the
court
discusses
the
alleged
error,
there
is
an
adjudication
on
the
merits,
but
that
plays
into
the
larger
and
broader
rule.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
yes,
in
--
especially
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
state
courts,
which
are
--
must
decide
both
the
federal
and
state
questions.
so
their
interpretation
of
what
a
claim
is
does
not
necessarily
mean
what
it
eventually
becomes
when
it's
in
federal
habeas.
and
the
federal
habeas
courts
are
limited
by
their
jurisdiction
to
only
be
federal
law
theories,
and
a
federal
petitioner
can
only
bring
such
claims.
so,
for
that
reason,
it's
--
it's
not
the
good
fit
for
the
state
courts
to
limit
them
in
that
way.
and
that's
why
we're
saying,
at
least
in
a
situation
where
a
state
court
has
grappled
with
the
substance
of
the
error,
that
it
has
adjudicated
the
claim,
which
it
could
have
viewed,
as
was
here,
sort
of
a
single
claim
independent,
or
it
could
have
state
law
theories
and
federal
law
theories
that
it
puts
together.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
stephanie
brenan
thank
you.
i
would
just
like
to
make
about
four
points.
first,
my
friend
discussed
the
case
of
smith
v.
digmon.
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
point
this
court
to
the
words
that
were
used
in
smith
v.
digmon,
which
is
where
the
state
court
chooses
to
ignore
in
its
opinion.
and
as
this
court
later
said
in
castille
talking
about
that,
that's
an
implicit
rejection.
so,
really,
the
way
it
should
be
interpreted
is,
if
a
state
court
fails
to
mention
in
its
opinion
writing,
it's
implicitly
rejected,
not
that
it's
been
ignored.
secondly,
i'd
just
like
to
agree
that,
yes,
california
believes
that
1089
is
constitutional
under
the
sixth
amendment.
and,
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
in
miller
v.
stagner
said
that
it
was
facially
constitutional.
third,
i
would
just
like
to
agree
with
justice
sotomayor
that
here,
where
the
trial
court
made
the
finding
of
bias,
that
answered
the
sixth
amendment
question.
the
entire
argument
below
and
throughout
was
a
disagreement
as
to
whether
the
juror
was
biased,
or
was
he
just
having
--
harboring
doubts
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
those
were
the
counterarguments.
the
trial
court,
by
making
the
determination
that
there
was
bias,
necessarily
answered
that
question.
secondly,
as
to
that
point,
i
would
just
like
to
also
point
this
court
to
the
language
in
people
v.
cleveland
that
talks
about
agreeing
with
thomas
and
brown
and
symington
that
you
cannot
dismiss
a
juror
based
on
his
views
of
the
evidence.
and
that's
at
21
p.
3d
at
page
--
1236.
so
it
couldn't
have
--
in
order
to
have
good
cause
in
california,
you
couldn't
have
gotten
rid
of
him
for
his
views
of
the
evidence.
finally,
i'd
just
like
to
say
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
correct
that
this
would
increase
the
litigation.
we
would
have
courts,
federal
habeas
courts
all
the
time
trying
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
indication
or
not
by
deciding
whether
state
law
is
coterminous
with
federal
law.
as
we've
already
seen
in
california,
following
the
issuance
of
this
decision
that's
exactly
the
type
of
arguments
that
we're
getting
all
the
time
now.
and
for
that
reason,
this
court
should
adopt
the
rule
that
where
a
fairly
presented
claim
has
been
rejected
by
a
state
court,
it
has
denied
that
claim,
adjudicated
that
claim
on
the
merits.
if
there
is
anything
else?
