justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
give
you
this
hypothetical.
the
brief
filed
with
an
intermediate
state
court
of
appeals
contains
25
pages
of
argument
on
a
federal
constitutional
claim.
let's
say
it's
a
brady
claim.
and
then
it
also
has
two
other
claims,
two
other
arguments.
they
are
state
law
claims,
and
each
one
is
dealt
with
in
two
pages.
and
then
the
state
court,
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
issues
an
opinion
that
addresses
only
the
two
state
law
claims
and
says
nothing
about
the
federal
constitutional
claim.
you
would
say
there
that
--
that
it's
conclusively
presumed
that
they
adjudicated
the
federal
constitutional
claim?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
it
necessary
to
go
so
far
as
to
require
a
plain
statement?
why
wouldn't
you
protect
the
same
interests
if
you
had
a
rule
that
said
that
there
is
a
presumption
that
they
have
adjudicated
the
claim
on
the
merits,
but
that
it
can
be
rebutted
if
there
is
a
strong
inference
that
they
overlooked
it
or
a
very
strong
inference
that
they
overlooked
it.
then
you
wouldn't
have
situations
like
the
one
that
justice
sotomayor
posed
in
her
hypothetical
or
the
one
that
i
just
mentioned.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
--
what
if
the
brief
raises
five
arguments,
and
the
opinion
says
the
appellant
has
raised
four
arguments,
is
that
a
plain
statement
that
the
fifth
--
the
fifth
argument
was
overlooked?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
not
a
plain
statement?
what
if
there
is
one
federal
claim
--
one
federal
argument
and
five
state
arguments,
and
the
opinion
says,
this
appeal
raises
only
issues
of
state
law,
is
that
a
plain
statement?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
but
that's
the
state
court.
here
didn't
--
would
you
disagree
that
the
california
supreme
court
in
cleveland
correctly
or
incorrectly
adopted
a
rule
that
it
believed
was
consistent
with
the
federal
constitution?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
were
they
under
any
obligation
to
agree
with
federal
courts
of
appeal
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
didn't
the
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
--
section
1089
is
very
broadly
worded;
isn't
that
right?
the
section
that
was
being
interpreted
in
cleveland?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
you
think
that
the
california
supreme
court
said,
we're
announcing
a
rule
of
state
law,
and,
you
know,
we've
been
told
that
this
rule
is
inconsistent
with
the
sixth
amendment,
but
we
don't
care,
and
we're
not
even
--
we're
not
going
to
worry
about
what
the
sixth
amendment
requires,
we're
just
going
to
adopt
this
rule
as
state
law;
do
you
think
that's
what
they
did?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
question
in
this
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
“adjudicated
on
the
merits
and
the
provision
of
the
federal
habeas
statute”.
this
question,
which
implicates
the
standard
of
review
in
federal
habeas
proceedings,
arises
when
a
state
court
is
arguably
presented
with
a
federal
claim
but
does
not
address
that
claim
in
an
opinion
that,
while
denying
relief,
discusses
other
claims.
applying
our
decision
in
harrington
versus
richter,
we
hold
that
in
these
circumstances,
there
is
a
strong
but
rebuttable
presumption
that
the
federal
claim
was
adjudicated
on
the
merits.
we
further
hold
that
this
presumption
was
not
rebutted
in
the
present
case.
therefore,
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
