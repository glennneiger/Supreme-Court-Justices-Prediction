justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
--
you
began
by
saying
that
these
are
merits
defenses,
but
you
wanted
to
focus
first
on
--
on
the
jurisdictional
question
that's
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
to
get
you
back
to
the
--
the
jurisdiction
point,
let's
--
let's
just
assume
a
hypothetical
case
where
a
regulated
entity
has
to
pay
an
exaction
which
it
deems
to
be
a
penalty.
and
let's
assume
it
can
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
but
it
doesn't.
it
waits
until
the
penalty's
assessed
and
then
when
the
penalty's
assessed
it
says,
this
is
a
taking.
that
--
is
that
the
case
that
you
want
to
discuss
with
us
today?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you
just
--
but
then
you
just
lose
on
the
merits.
what
the
ninth
circuit
says,
they
can't
even
argue
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that
what
we
were
going
to
decide
was
whether
or
not,
assuming
you
can
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
you
must
go
to
the
court
of
claims,
can
you
prefer
to
wait,
have
a
penalty
assessed
against
you
and
say
this
is
unconstitutional,
it's
a
taking.
your
position
is
you
can't
say
that.
i
don't
understand
why.
other
than,
if
you
want
to
talk
about
williamson
and
so
forth,
we
can
get
into
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
did
have
standing.
could
they
raise
the
claim?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
they
have
standing.
could
they
raise
the
claim--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no,
no.
in
the
administrative
proceeding
where
they
are
charged
with
--
where
a
penalty
is
being
assessed
against
them.
