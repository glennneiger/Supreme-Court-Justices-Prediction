mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there's
a
surprising
number
of
difficult
merits
questions
lurking
in
this
case,
mostly
involving
whether
there
was
a
taking,
and
if
so,
how
it
should
be
conceptualized
and
valued.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
certainly.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
other
two
partners
in
lassen
were
laura
horne's
parents,
now
deceased.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
department
of
agriculture
did
not
distinguish
among
them.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
they
are
separate
--
they
are
separate
legal
entities,
all
effectively
controlled
by
the
same
family.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
--
i'm
delighted
to
preview
our
--
our
argument
on
the
merits
on
that.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
so
the
--
so
the--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
order
in
this
case
was
issued
against
the
--
the
hornes
in
their
capacity
as
a
handler
only,
so
the
entire
fine
was
paid
by
them.
none
of
the
fine
is
attributable
to
anyone
in
their
capacity
as
a
producer.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
so
--
so
this
is
--
this
is
our
position,
justice
sotomayor.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
is
it
that
the
department
of
agriculture
attempted
to
take.
so,
in
the
demand
letter
from
the
department
of
agriculture
addressed
to
the
hornes,
they
asked
the
hornes
to
deliver
california
raisins,
or
the
dollar
equivalent.
so
that's
the
fact
upon
which
all
of
this
case
is
--
is
built.
now,
what
is
the
legal
significance
of
that,
california
raisins
or
the
dollar
equivalent?
it
is
our
legal
position,
or
it
will
be
our
legal
position
on
the
merits
that
when
the
government
seeks
a
specific
physical
property,
a
res,
or
its
monetary
equivalent,
that
that
is
a
taking
of
the
res
itself.
and
there's
--
and
there's
support
for
that
in
the
--
for
precedent
from
this
court.
the
closest
case
is
village
of
norwood
v.
baker.
in
this
case,
the
--
the
city
condemned
a
strip
of
land
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
road.
they
tried
to
get
out
of
paying
any
compensation
by
claiming
that
the
abutting
landowner
would
gain
value.
that
was
rejected.
they
were
assessed
$2,000
compensation
for
the
taking.
and
then
the
city
turned
around
and
issued
a
special
assessment
against
the
landowner
for
precisely
that
$2,000.
the
landowner
came
back
up
to
this
court,
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
taking
--
a
taking
of
the
land.
and
in
a
subsequent
case
just
a
couple
of
years
later,
the
court
described
this
as
a,
quote
"actual
confiscation
of
private
property
to
public
use.
"
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right.
i
hope
it
helps
to
inform
the
jurisdictional
question.
but
the
jurisdictional
question
is
this:
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
my
clients
could
not
even
raise
their
takings
claim
on
the
merits
until
they
had
first
gone
to
the
court
of
claims.
i
think
there
are
three
things
wrong
with
that.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
think
that
the
government
no
longer
disputes,
although
you
should
ask
them
to
be
clear
--
i
think
that
they
no
longer
dispute
that
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
client,
even
though
they
prevailed
after
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--on
the
ground
that
it
was
jurisdictional.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
--
whether
the
claim
is
being
brought
in
the
capacity
of
producer
or
handler
i
think
is
not
relevant
to
one
of
our
arguments,
and
it
is
relevant
to
the
other
argument.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
no,
no.
no,
we're
representing
people
who
are
both
producers
and
handlers.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
depends
upon
whether
the
taking
has
been
from
them
or
not.
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
ordinary
relationship
between
a
producer
and
a
handler,
the
producer
is
not
paid
for
the
reserve
raisins
and
therefore
any
payment
that
would
come,
any
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
those
raisins
would
go
to
the
producer,
and
that
would
go
i
think
to
the
court
of
claims.
in
this
case,
though,
the
business
model
is
quite
different
from
that
and
the
producers
in
this
case
were
paid
everything.
they
received
full
market
value
for
their
raisins.
the
only
people
who
are
out
any
money
in
this
case
are
the
hornes
in
their
capacity
as
handler.
so
that's
why
they
are
the
only
ones--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i'm
not
sure
what--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i'm
not
sure
which
money
you're
--
they
have
not
asserted
any
claim
on
any
money.
the
producers
have
been
completely
paid
off.
it
is
the
handlers
who
have
been
held
responsible.
and
the
reason
they
were
held
responsible
was
the
following
logic,
and
you
see
this
on
--
on
--
on
page
78
of
the
judicial
officer's
opinion.
they
were
held
responsible
because
in
their
--
in
their
processing
capacity,
when
they
were
doing
the
stemming,
the
seeding,
the
fumigating,
the
packing,
that
this
was
regarded
by
the
department
of
agriculture
as
possession,
physical
possession
of
the
raisins
and
acquisition
of
the
raisins,
even
though
they
never
had
title
to
the
raisins.
it's
the
department
of
agriculture
that
has
attached
to
them
a
possessory
interest
in
the
raisins
and
then
assessed
them
the
full
monetary
equivalent
of
those
raisins,
full
market
value,
$484,000
for
the
market
value
because
it's
--
because
under
this
very
unusual
regulatory
scheme
the
government
regards
them
as
having
possessed
the
raisins
even
though
that
--
that
is
not--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--if
they
had
--
if
they
had
not
been
paid
for
the
raisins,
they
had
taken
raisins
to
a
handler,
received
no
money
for
them,
i
think
that
they
could
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
go
that
route,
and
the
question
i
think
is
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
legal
consequences
of
that--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--because
what
they
--
what
they
knew
was
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
compensated
for
the
raisins,
and
therefore
they
came
up
with
a
--
with
a
plan,
a
business
plan
that
they
believed
made
--
eliminated
any
handler
and
made
it
unnecessary
for
any
of
the
independent
producers
on
whose
behalf
they're
operating
to
turn
over
raisins
to
the
government.
the
plan
was
ultimately
rejected
and
we
haven't
brought
a
--
a
cert
petition
on
it,
but
the
plan
actually
complies
with
the
--
with
the
language
of
the
--
of
the
regulation,
because
they
believe
that
in
their
capacity
as
handler,
as
processor,
that
they
never
acquired
the
raisins.
“
acquisition
”
is
the
key
term
for
becoming
a
handler
under
the
rule.
and
they
believe
that
since
they
were
simply
providing
a
service
for
--
for
$12
a
ton
to
their
neighbors,
that
they
never
acquired
the
raisins,
they
never
possessed
the
raisins,
and
therefore
no
one
had
to
comply
the
regulation.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
--
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
right.
when
the
underlying
order
would
be
a
taking
and
they
have
been
assessed
money
because
they
didn't
comply
with
the
taking,
we
believe
they
can
challenge
that
as
a
taking.
and
both
under
the
amaa
procedures,
which
are
exclusive,
i
think
that
they
have
to
go
through
the
--
through
the
department
of
agriculture
and
then
to
the
district
court,
but
i
also
think
under
the
principles
of
the
--
announced
by
this
court
in
of
the
apfel
decision
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
remedy
in
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
so
if
they
are
just
a
handler--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--as
the
department
of
agriculture
treated
them,
as
far
as
the
department
of
agriculture
is
concerned
they
are
only
a
handler.
they
are
required
to
raise
--
exhaust
their
claims
before
the
department
of
agriculture
and
then
challenge
the
order
in
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
don't
think
that
that's
so.
i
think
that
we
--
that
the
hornes
ought
to
prevail
on
either
--
in
either
of
their
capacities.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
any
handler
who
has
a
business
model
that
is
similar
to
this.
but
most
handlers--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--so
most
handlers,
if
they're
in
compliance
with
the
order,
they
take
all
the
raisins
from
the
producers,
they
only
pay
for
--
for
the
free
pool
of
raisins.
they
don't
pay
for
the
reserve
raisins
and
they
never
have
any
interest
in
the
reserve
raisins.
in
this
case,
the
hornes
did
not
operate
that
way.
the
--
the
producers
received
full
value
for
all
of
their
raisins.
so
the
producers
are
--
are
not
in
the
case.
they
have
no
standing.
they
have
no
pocketbook
injury.
the
--
the
entire
pocketbook
injury
in
this
case
is
borne
by
the
hornes
in
their
capacity
as
a
handler.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
in
response
to--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
exactly.
and
the
hornes
believed
that
this
would
mean
that
they
were
not
handlers.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
and
that
--
and
they
were
found
to
be
handlers
anyway.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
no.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
taking
is
what
the
government
demanded,
which
was
either
give
me
your
house
or
give
me
your
money,
give
me
your
raisins
or
give
us
the
monetary
equivalent.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
by
the
time
--
by
the
time
this
order
was
enforced,
the
raisins
were
gone
and
so
as
a
practical
matter,
only
one
of
those
two
alternatives
was
left
as
a
matter
of
timing.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
if
they
had
not
been
paid
for
the
raisins.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
right.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
withdraws
tucker
act
jurisdiction
only
for
handlers.
so
if
we're
talking
about
pure
producers--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--pure
producers
do
not
go
to
the
--
don't
have
to
go
through
the
amaa
process.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
these
new
deal-era
programs,
justice
scalia,
are
somewhat
--
the
purpose
is
somewhat
obscure--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--oh,
well,
this
is
straightforwardly
set
forth
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
sections
14(a)
and
15(a)
of
the
amaa.
i
don't
think
that's
in
dispute.
so
only
producers
are
--
are
regulated
by
this
program.
only
producers
have
a
right
to
go
through
their
remedies
in
the
department
of
agriculture.
only
producers
have
to
do
that.
it's
--
it's
a
--
it's
completely
a
producer--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i'm
sorry,
i'm
sorry.
excuse
me.
each
of
those
was
--
please
substitute
the
word
“
handler
”
for
each
of
those.
it's
only
the
handlers
that
are
regulated
under
this
--
under
this
program.
so,
and
--
and
my
clients
were
treated
as
handlers.
they
believed
that
they
were
not.
but
it
is
the
department
of
agriculture
that
has
attached
this
--
this
status
to
them.
and
it's
--
it's
i
think
quite
a
catch
22
for
the
government
to
come
along
and
say,
although
we
are
fining
you
$700,000
in
your
capacity
as
a
handler,
you're
not
a
handler
for
purposes
of
challenging
the
legality
of
that
order.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that's
almost
exactly
right.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
with
--
with
one
detail
different--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--which
is
that
this
is
the
proceeding
here
that
decides
whether
they
have
to
pay.
they
have
not
yet
paid
the
fine.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
so
they're
raising
a
defense.
it
isn't
that
they
are
--
it
isn't
that
they're
getting
--
trying
to
get
it
back.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
but
that
detail
actually
is
quite
important,
because,
remember,
you
can't
even
go
to
the
court
of
claims
unless
you
are
seeking
damages
for
an
actual
violation
that
has
already
taken
place.
we
could
not
go
to
the
court
--
the
hornes
could
not
go
to
the
court
of
claims
right
now.
what
the
government
says
is
that
they
should
pay
the
$700,000
fine
first
and
then
go
to
the
court
of
claims
to
get
it
back.
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
apfel,
is
a,
quote,
"pointless
set
of
activities
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have--
"
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--“
have
contemplated
”.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
the
most
pertinent
case
for
that
part
of
the
fine,
for
the
penalty
part,
is
missouri
pacific
railroad
v.
nebraska.
so
this
is
the
case
where
the
railroad
was
told
by
the
state
to
do
some
--
some
expensive
work,
the
railroad
says
no,
that
would
be
a
taking
if
we
were
required
to
do
that.
there
is
no
compensation
available
and
so
they
don't
do
it.
they're
fined
$500.
that
gets
up
to
this
court
and
an
opinion
by
mr.
--
justice
holmes,
the
court
holds
that
that
is
a
taking
and
that
the
railroad
is
entitled
to
challenge
the
taking
in
the
form
of
the
fine.
so
for
--
for
the
penalty
portion,
the
punishment
portion
of
the
fine,
missouri
pacific
railroad
is
actually
the
more
pertinent
decision.
which
comes
back
--
i
don't
think
i
fully
answered
all
the
variants
of
justice
sotomayor's
question.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
may
i
tick
off
the
three
reasons?
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
one
is
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
jurisdiction.
second,
the
tucker
act
does
not
apply
to
cases
where
--
where
there
is
a
defense
being
lodged
to
a
monetary
exaction.
that's
apfel
as
supplemented
by
missouri
pacific
railroad.
and
third,
even
if
that
were
not
so,
the
amaa
displaces
the
tucker
act
and
they
were
required
to
exhaust
their
remedies
before
the
department
of
agriculture
and
take
their
case
to
the
district
court
in
which
they
are
residing.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
first
is
that
it
isn't
jurisdictional
and
therefore
it
should
not
have
been
raised--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
--
the
requirement
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims
when
you
--
when
you
need
to
is
not
jurisdictional,
that
that's
a
matter
of
remedy,
that
is,
it's
--
it's
the
equitable
principle
that
you
may
not
pursue
your
case
for
an
injunctive
relief
when
there's
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
so
had
they
held
on
to
their
own
raisins
and
sold
them,
i
assume,
you
don't
--
not
just
left
them
rot,
if
they
had
sold
them,
then
the
department
of
agriculture
would
have
called
them
a
handler,
because
anyone
who
sells
raisins
is
called
a
handler,
and
then
they
would
be
fined
in
their
capacity
as
a
handler
and
it
would
be
a
somewhat
similar
case
to
this
one.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
maybe
an
easier
one
than
this
one.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
not
necessarily
correct.
there
are
a
whole
string
of
cases
in
which
property
owners
raise
takings
as
a
defense
rather
than
turning
over
the
property.
kaiser
aetna
is
perhaps
the
most
--
best
known
recent
case,
but
out
of
an
administrative
context,
there's
the
florida
power
&
light
case.
penn
central
was
--
was
like
this.
loretto
v.
teleprompter
is
like
this.
there's
a
whole
string
of
cases.
the
government
themselves
cite
six
such
cases,
most
of
them
fairly
old,
for
this
proposition.
so
there's
nothing
unusual
about
bringing
a
--
a
defensive
takings
claim.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
and
they
did
that
on
a
ground
that
we
think
is
manifestly
inconsistent
with
this
court's
precedents.
we
were
prepared
to
--
we
were
trying
to
get
an
en
banc
review
and
were
prepared
to
come
to
this
court
from
the
merits
determination.
we
were
blocked
from
that
because
the
government,
after
the
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed,
came
up
with
calling
this
a
jurisdictional
argument,
raised
this
objection
for
the
first
time;
and
the
ninth
circuit
panel
accepted
their
view,
issued
a
new
opinion
stripping
out
the
entire
merits
and
substituting
this
jurisdictional
holding
that
is
producing
so
much
enjoyment
for
us
this
morning.
[laughter]
may
i
reserve
the
remaining
time?
thank
you.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i'd
like
to
make
two
quick
points.
one
is
that
i
believe
that
the
government
has
essentially
conceded
here
in
this
argument
and
in
their
brief
that
the
tucker
act
does
not
apply.
they
have
told
us
that
the
tucker
act
does
not
apply
on
page
50
and
repeated
here
when
congress
could
not
have
contemplated
a
compensation.
now,
in
addition
--
and
their
only
answer
to
that
is
to
say,
first,
that
congress
didn't
think
it
would
be
a
taking,
which
in
regional
rail,
this
court
said
is
not
the
question.
and
secondly,
that
if
--
if
there's
one
--
we
should
get
paid
once,
compensation
once
and
then
the
administrator's
going
to
cancel
the
program,
which
is
no
answer
at
all.
either
the
statute
contemplates
compensation
for
everybody
or
it
contemplates
it
for
nobody.
i
think
they
have
effectively
conceded
that
the
tucker
act
does
not
apply.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
to
handlers.
and--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--and
the
second
issue
i
wanted
to
talk
about
so
is
this
capacity
issue.
certainly,
we
have
standing.
when
--
it's
not
third-party
standing.
all
of
the
money
comes
out
of
our
pocket,
yes,
we
have
standing.
and
secondly,
we
certainly
--
and
then
that
is
in
our
capacity
as
handler.
essentially,
the
department
of
agriculture's
view
is
that
during
those
couple
of
days
when
the
raisins
are
going
through
our
packing
plant,
that
we
acquired
them
and
possessed
them
during
those
couple
of
days
and
that
we
should
have
given
them
their
--
their
share.
that's
raisins,
that's
not
money.
but
by
the
time
they
get
around
to
enforcing
that
and
so
forth,
the
raisins
are
gone
and
now
the
money
stands
in
--
stands
in
for
the
raisins.
but
that
is
a
taking
claim.
we
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
straightforward
taking
claim
under
--
under
norwood
and
missouri
pacific
railroad,
that's
a
merits
question.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
not
a
problem
of
capacity.
whatever
might
be,
that
taking,
that
taking
is
in
the
capacity
as
a
handler.
those
are
my
two
points.
thank
you.
