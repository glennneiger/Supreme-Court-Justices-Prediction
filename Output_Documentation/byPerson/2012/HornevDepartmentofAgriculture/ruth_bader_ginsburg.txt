justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
there
is
no
dispute
on
that
point,
that
the
--
the
takings
claim
could
have
been
asserted
by
the
hornes
as
producers
in
the
court
of
federal
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
jurisdictional--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--jurisdictional
or
not,
as
a
practical
matter,
producers
who
are
not
subject
to
fine
as
handlers,
but
the
producers
of
the
raisins
whose
raisins
are
being
segregated,
could
they
go
to
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
say
my
raisins
have
been
taken?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'd
just
like
a
straight
answer
to
that
question.
you
--
you
are
representing
producers,
and
they
just
produce--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
saying
hypothetically
--
hypothetically.
is
the
court
of
federal
claims
the
proper
forum
for
a
producer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mcconnell,
would
you
explain
the
--
if
they
were
just
handlers
and
weren't
producing
any
raisins,
if
they
were
just
handlers,
do
they
have
a
claim
and
where?
and
if
they
were
just
producers
--
i
take
it
from
the
question
i
asked
and
the
question
justice
kagan
asked
that
if
they
were
just
producers,
the
raisins
got
set
aside,
they
were
paid
for
only
the
ones
that
went
to
market,
they
could
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
but
now
they're
just
handlers,
as
this
entity
is
for
most
of
the
raisins
that
are
involved,
some
80
percent,
right?
it's
only
about
20
percent
is
their
own.
so,
could
this
work
for
someone
who
was
just
a
handler,
doesn't
produce
any
raisins?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
understand
is
this
scheme.
apparently
it
wasn't
enough
just
to
be
a
handler
or
just
to
be
a
producer.
the
claim
that
you're
making
turns
on
the
coincidence
of
being
both
the
producer
and
a
handler.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
any
handler,
any
handler
could
be
making
the
same
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
do
you
mean
by
--
what's
the
business
model
that's
similar
to
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
mcconnell,
i
don't
want
to
encroach
on
your
rebuttal
time,
but
one
mysterious
thing.
the
first
time
around,
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
case
on
the
merits.
so
if
you're
right,
i
take
it,
we
remand
and
then
they
adjudicate
the
merits
of
the
takings
claim.
but
they
already
did
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
palmore,
am
i
incorrect
in
thinking
that
the
government
is
saying,
handlers
cannot
raise
the
constitutionality
of
the
raisin
marketing
order?
you've
told
us
that
the
producers
can
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
what
about
the
handlers?
they're
at
least
being
fined
for
violating
the
act,
and
it's
their
position
that
the
whole
thing
is
unconstitutional.
can
they
raise
the
constitutionality
of
the
whole
arrangement
defensively,
or
they
simply
can't
raise
the
constitutionality
of
the
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be--
