justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
trying
to
get
to
what
you're
arguing
about.
and
i
might
be
off
base
by
now.
i
feel
like
handlers,
purchasers,
raisins,
like
an
old
abbott
and
costello
movie.
i
just
want
to
see
if
i'm
right.
tell
me.
just
say
you're
wrong
and
i
don't
go
into
it
further.
there
--
there
are
some
people,
they've
been
--
they
are
either
--
they
have
some
raisins,
all
right.
and
these
particular
people,
whom
the
department
has
said
have
acquired
the
raisins,
it
said
they
acquired
the
raisins.
and
so
they're
there
with
some
raisins,
and
then
the
government
says:
do
this
thing
with
your
raisins.
and
they
don't
want
to
do
it,
so
they
don't.
they
don't
do
it
even
though
the
law
says
do
it.
and
then
they
say
the
law
is
unconstitutional
and,
moreover,
you
fined
us
a
huge
amount
of
money
and
we
don't
want
to
pay
it
because
the
law
is
unconstitutional,
and
we
consider
that
money
to
be
paid.
call
it
a
fine,
call
it
what
you
want.
we
consider
we
shouldn't
have
paid
it
and
now
we
want
it
back
and
we
want
compensation
and
we
think
it's
a
taking
and
where
do
we
go.
can't
we
make
that
argument
in
the
ninth
circuit?
it's
something
like
that;
isn't
that
what
we're
arguing
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
not
quite.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay,
okay.
so
we
shouldn't
have
to
pay
because
this
is
all
unconstitutional.
and
--
and
now
what's
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
the
ninth
circuit
says
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
and
you
say
no,
we
don't
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
i
was
trying
to
do
was
to
get
you
on
the
basic
argument,
which
you
started
with,
which
is
why
is
there
--
why
was
the
ninth
circuit
wrong
when
they
said
they
had
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
this,
that
rather,
they
had
to
go
--
you
had
to
go
to
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
there's
a
similar
--
i
mean,
it
seemed
to
me,
again
simplifying,
that
underlying
this
their
clients
think
this
whole
raisin
program
is
unconstitutional.
what
it
does
is
it
takes
raisins
that
we
grow,
in
effect
throws
them
in
the
river.
and
in
the
thirties,
that
was
done
to
raise
raisin
prices.
and
they
think
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
just
hurts
people
by
raising
prices,
and
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
it
takes
raisins
from
some
people
that
belong
to
them
and
uses
them
for
this
bad
purpose.
okay,
that's
their
view
of
it,
something
like
that,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
so
they're
making
that
kind
of
constitutional
claim.
now,
i
would
think
if
all
you
told
me
was
that
and
i
knew
nothing
about
all
these
statutes,
i
would
say
that's
the
kind
of
claim
that
should
be
made
in
a
federal
district
court,
period,
not
the
court
of
claims.
because
their
government
isn't
going
to
compensate
them
for
anything.
that's
against
the
whole
point
of
the
program.
either
this
program
is
valid
or
it
isn't.
and
if
it
isn't,
some
authoritative
set
of
courts
should
tell
us
that.
so
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
somehow
not
a
right
fit
with
the
court
of
claims.
now,
you
explain
to
me
why
that
purely
instinctive
feeling
at
this
point
is
completely
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
just
compensation,
i
take
it,
in
the
program
is
supposed
to
come
from
the
fact
that
raisin
prices
go
up.
whether
the
poor
children
with
their
noses
pressed
to
the
glass,
because
they
can't
pay
the
raisins,
their
parents
are
the
ones
who
are
paying
the
compensation.
and
certainly
not
the
taxpayer,
he's
not
going
to
pay
it,
and
maybe
the
other
producers
will
pay
some
who
get
gypped
or
something,
i
don't
know.
but
i
can't
believe
that
congress
wanted
the
taxpayers
to
pay
for
a
program
that's
going
to
mean
they
have
to
pay
higher
prices
as
consumers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
no,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
merits.
it
goes
to
whether
or
not
it
makes
sense
to
think
that
the
court
of
claims
has
something
to
say
about
this.
and
suppose
we
did
this.
suppose
we
said,
given
the
fact
that
you
filed
your
thing,
whatever
it
was,
you
know,
late,
and
the
--
and
the
light
of
this
very
enlightening
discussion
which
has
been
helpful,
we
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
program
and
challenge
to
the
program
where
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
remedy
really
in
the
court
of
claims
and
they
ought
to
go
ahead
in
the
ninth
circuit,
and
in
light
of
all
these
enlightening
things
that
we'll
write,
you
just
decide
the
merits
of
--
is
that
--
now,
i'm
sure
you're
going
to
say
that's
absolutely
terrible,
it
won't
work
at
all.
so
tell
me
why
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
we'd
say
--
we'll
say
given
the
way
that
we've
talked
about
the
program,
perhaps
it's
best
to
consider
this
matter
fully.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
the
word
“
acquire
”
mean.
there
is
some
opinion
here
which
says
these
handlers
acquired
the
raisins.
what
is
--
what's
that
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
like
lessees
or
something,
bailees?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
no,
no.
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
the
word
“
acquire
”--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
can
an
acquirer
of
my
car,
for
example
--
i
don't
know.
forget
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
they
--
can
they
assert
a
takings
claim
attaches
to
the
car?
it
sounds
like
a
standing
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
still,
it
might
if
they're
acquirers
--
but
they
are
acquirers,
okay?
they
think
this
program
is
unconstitutional
because
it
takes
some
other
people's
property,
all
right?
so
those
other
people
are
in
a
very
special
relation
to
them.
those
other
people
are
really
close.
and
it
may
be
they
have
standing
to
assert
those
other
people's
claims.
and
if
they
do
have
standing
to
assert
those
other
people's
claims,
why
can't
they
make
the
argument
that
way?
