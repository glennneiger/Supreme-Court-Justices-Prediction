john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-123,
horne
v.
department
of
agriculture.
mr.
mcconnell?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
mcconnell.
mr.
palmore?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
did
you
first
raise
the
argument
that
it
was
jurisdictional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
now
you
are
--
now
you
are
changing
back
again
and
saying
it's
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
relied
on
that
when
you
got
to
rehearing.
you
didn't
rely
on
that
before
you
went
before
the
ninth
circuit,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
to
say
--
i
think
it
comes
with
less
than
good
grace
for
you
to
criticize
the
other
side
for
not
having
raised
a
particular
argument.
but
i
do
want
to
clarify
that
you
have
no
objection
at
this
point
for
reversing
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
ground
that
they
erred
in
saying
that
this
--
they
should
have
dismissed
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
palmore.
mr.
mcconnell,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-123,
horne
versus
department
of
agriculture.
