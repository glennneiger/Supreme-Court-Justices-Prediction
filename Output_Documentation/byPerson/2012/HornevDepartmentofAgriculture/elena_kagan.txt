justice
elena
kagan
mr.
mcconnell,
i'm
sorry.
could
i
--
along
the
lines
of
what
justice
ginsburg
was
saying,
suppose
that
the
hornes
had
given
over
all
the
raisins,
right,
but
that
they
thought
that
this
was
improper,
that
this
marketing
order
was
--
it
was
a
violation
of
the
takings
clause.
could
they
have
gone
to
the
court
of
claims
via
the
tucker
act
and
said,
we
want
our
money
back?
they
gave
--
they
gave
over
the
raisins,
they
say
we're
entitled
to
compensation.
could
they
have
gone
through
the
court
of
claims?
justice
elena
kagan
in
other
words,
the
hornes
did
what
the
marketing
order
suggested
they
should
do.
they
gave
over
the
raisins.
but
they
said
this
is
just
improper.
you're
saying
they
could
go
to
the
court
of
claims?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
if
--
if
that's
the
case,
i
guess
then
the
question
is,
why
didn't
they
have
to
go
that
route?
justice
elena
kagan
right.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
true--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
think
that's
true,
mr.
mcconnell,
as
to
part
of
the
fine,
that
part
of
the
fine
falls
under
apfel,
but
not
the
other
part.
as
to
the
compensation
part,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
pretty
decent
apfel
argument.
but
as
to
the
penalty
part,
i
don't
really
understand
how
the
apfel
argument
would
go.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
to
the
penalty
part,
the
key
thing
is
that
if
they
had
handed
over
the
raisins,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
had
the
compensation
done
there.
and
the
fact
that
the
government
is
penalizing
them
for
not
complying
with
the
marketing
order
does
not
fall
within
the
rationale
of
apfel.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
palmore,
before
you
do
that
then,
haven't
you
conceded
the
point
that
this
is
not
jurisdictional?
justice
elena
kagan
but
mr.
palmore,
if
you
are
conceding
now
that
this
is
not
jurisdictional,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
tucker
act
argument
as
a
substantive
argument,
i
mean,
has
been
waived.
you
didn't
raise
that
argument
until
the
rehearing
petition.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
why
is
that
a
necessary
part
of
apfel?
why
didn't
apfel
just
mean
when
we
are
dealing
with
cash
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims?
so
even
if
--
you
know,
you
can
have
a
discussion
in
the
district
court
about
whether
it's
not
dollar-for-dollar
and
it
should
be
discounted
in
some
way.
but
why
should
the
fact
that
its
dollar-for-dollar
mean
--
why
is
that
a
requirement,
as
opposed
to
just
it's
cash
and
so
the
question
of,
like,
you
know,
handing
some
--
handing
it
all
over
and
getting
some
back,
that
can
be
done
in
the
district
court
rather
than
making
somebody
file
a
separate
suit?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
palmore,
what
would
be
wrong
--
would
anything
be
wrong
--
with
a
--
with
a
disposition
of
this
court
that
went
something
like
this:
everybody
agrees
that
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
issue,
including
the
government,
so
they
got
that
wrong.
now,
as
to
this
whole
business
about
the
tucker
act
and
whether
the
tucker
act
provides
a
remedy,
the
government
only
started
talking
about
that
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc,
and
the
government
can't
do
that.
you
know,
it
can't
introduce
an
argument
like
this
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc.
so
that's
waived.
and
now,
the
ninth
circuit
can
go
and
try
to
figure
out
whether
this
marketing
order
is
a
taking
or
it's
just
the
world's
most
outdated
law.
[laughter]
