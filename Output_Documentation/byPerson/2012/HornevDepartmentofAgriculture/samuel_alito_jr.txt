well,
but
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
that
--
you
said
the
producers
could
go
to
the
--
the
court
of
federal
claims
to
contest
the
taking
of
--
producers
could
go
to
contest
the
taking
of
raisins.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
they
had
not
been
paid
for
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
are
you
--
does
that
mean
you
do
not
think
that
the
amaa
withdraws
tucker
act
jurisdiction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
only
for
handlers.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
as
this
case
stands
as
it
comes
before
us,
is
there
a
claim
that
they
--
that
money
--
the
government
is
trying
to
take
money
from
them
without
just
compensation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
an
issue
we
should
decide
or
is
that
an
issue
that
the
ninth
circuit
should
decide,
whether
there
is
a
takings
claim
for
money?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
is
such
a
claim,
why
does
that
not
fall
within
apfel?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
don't
they
claim
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--before
you
leave
that,
don't
they
claim
that
the
entire
amount
that
is
assessed
against
them
is
a
taking?
now,
maybe
they
are
wrong.
that
the
entire
amount
assessed
against
them
is
a
taking
without
just
compensation?
maybe
they
are
wrong,
but
isn't
that
a
merits
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
a
couple
minutes
ago
that
if
the
case
were
remanded,
you
would
be
entitled
to
win
on
the
reasoning
of
the
panel
opinion?
