mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
where
justice
sotomayor
started
with
petitioner's
counsel,
because
any
takings
analysis
needs
to
begin
with
a
careful
identification
of
what
property
was
allegedly
taken.
petitioners
in
this
case
have
actually
advanced
two
different
theories
about
what
property
of
theirs
was
taken.
what
taking
is
at
issue
here?
raisins
and
money.
we
think
both
takings
claims
fail
for
threshold
reasons,
but
they're
different
threshold
reasons
that
call
for
different
analysis.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
agree
that
the
failure
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims
is
not
properly
viewed
as
a
jurisdictional
defect.
we
did
invoke
ninth
circuit
precedent
below
stating
that
it
was
jurisdictional.
and
some
of
this
cases
--
this
court's
cases
put
it
in
ripeness
terms,
which
is
an
article
iii
concept.
so
there
has
been
confusion--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--in
our
opposition
to
the
rehearing
petition.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
there
was
ninth
circuit
precedent
holding
that
it
was
jurisdictional,
and
we
relied
on
that
and
there
is
certainly
language
from
this
court--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that's
correct.
we
think
--
we
think
this
is
properly
viewed
as
a
substantive
defect
in
the
claim,
so
in
a
sense
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
initial
panel
decision
ruled
for
the
government
on
a
substantive
defect
one,
there's
no
taking.
and
what
it
did
on
rehearing
in
our
view,
although
it
attached
the
wrong
label
to
it,
it
substantively
was
correct
in
concluding
that
there
was
substantive
defect
number
two--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that
would
certainly
be
something
that
--
that
the
ninth
circuit
could
consider
in
the
event
there
were
a
remand
here.
but
the
ninth
circuit
did
decide
it.
the
substance
of
its
bottom
line
conclusion
was
correct
and
all
of
its
analysis
was
correct.
it
simply
used
the
wrong
words,
so
we
think
it
is
here.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--if
that
happens,
of
course,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
the
consequence
for
us
is
they
reinstate
the
prior
panel
opinion,
in
which--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i'm
not
going
to
resist
too
strenuously
that
kind
of
remand,
but
they
did
decide
it.
and
moreover,
they
decided
something
separate,
which
is
at
ja-305
they
said
something
different,
which
is
the
kind
of
threshold
defect
in
the
takings
claim
turning
on
raisins,
which
is
there
is
a
capacity
problem.
so
there
are
two
problems
with
the
raisin
claims,
a
capacity
problem
and
a
just
compensation
problem.
the
capacity
problem
is
this:
in
2002,
after
having
been
strictly
raisin
producers
since
1969,
entering
into
a
market
where
there
was
a
reserve
requirement
from
the
beginning,
they
knew
what
they
were
getting
into,
they
decided
to
adopt
a
new
business
model,
as
petitioner's
counsel
says.
but,
as
was
found
below,
they
adopted
a
business
model
that
was
an
intentional,
willful
attempt
to
evade
regulatory
requirements
in
order
to
secure
an
unfair
competitive
advantage.
but
what
they
did
was
they
took
on
the
obligations
of
a
handler.
they
became
raisin
handlers
in
2002.
and
what
came
with
that
status
were
a
series
of
regulatory
obligations
that
apply
only
to
handlers
and
under
the
amaa
can
apply
only
to
handlers:
the
requirement
to
have
raisins
inspected,
the
requirement
to
file
truthful
reports,
the
requirement
to
make
records
available,
and
the
requirement
to
separate
out
raisins
into
what's
called
free
tonnage
and
reserve
tonnage,
any
raisins
processed,
it
doesn't
matter
who
owns
them.
those
are
handler-specific
regulatory
obligations
that
were
imposed
upon
them,
and
they
violated
every
single
one
of
them
willfully
and
intentionally
in
order
to
secure
an
unfair
competitive
advantage.
and
what
the
usda
did
was
impose
penalties
on
them
for
the
violation
of
law
that
attached
to
them
only
as
raisin
handlers.
and
then
they
invoked
the
judicial
review
proceedings
in
section
14
that
provides
a
judicial
review
mechanism
only
for
handlers.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that's
not
correct,
justice
scalia.
they
have
to
give
the
raisins.
mr.
mcconnell
referred
to
demand
letters--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--they
are
under
a
regulatory
obligation
to
provide
the
raisins.
if
they
violate
that
regulatory
obligation,
they
are
subject
to
sanctions.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
one
component--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--no,
but
it's
not
a
choice.
and
i
think
that's
very
important
to
point
out.
there
were
actually
two
different
demand
letters.
mr.
mcconnell
referred
to
a
demand
letter
saying
your
raisins
or
your
money.
there
was
an
initial
demand
letter
saying:
you
are
a
handler;
you
have
to
comply;
we're
going
to
come
get
the
raisins.
the
second
demand
letter
said:
we
showed
up
--
literally
it
says:
we
showed
up
with
our
truck,
you
didn't
provide
the
raisins,
so
now
you
have
got
to
provide
the
cash
equivalent.
and
there
were
also
going
to
be,
as
there
were,
separate
regulatory
proceedings
brought
against
them
for
violating
those
--
those
obligations.
not
just
the
failure
to
reserve,
but
all
these
handler-specific
obligations.
they
filed
false
reports.
they
didn't
make
raisins
available
for
inspection.
there
were
a
whole
host
of
regulatory
violations
that
were
at
issue
here,
and
when
they
invoked
the
handler
review
action
in
the
district
court
they
could
assert
defenses
as
a
handler.
but,
for
instance,
another
producer
--
producers
can't
invoke
these
judicial
review
schemes.
another
producer
couldn't
have
intervened
in
that
action
to
assert
its
producer
claim.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that
was
certainly
not
how
we
understood
the
claim
to
be
litigated
below.
that's
not
how
the
ninth
circuit
thought
--
understood
the
claim.
we
have
been
talking
about
the
claim
involving
the
raisins,
which
fails
for
a
to
capacity
reason
and
a
just
compensation
reason.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
that
was
certainly
not
decided
below,
so
a
remand
--
to
the
extent
that
this
was
preserved,
a
remand
would
be
possible
outcome
there.
we
think,
though,
that
that
claim
suffers
from
separate
--
separate
threshold
defects.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
we
think
that
--
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
apfel
opinion
that's
referred
to
is
just
a
plurality.
it's
not
been
adopted
by
the
court.
second
of
all,
the
apfel
analysis
relied
on
this
one-for-one,
dollar-for-dollar
concept.
that
was
a
critical
part
of
the
plurality's
discussion
there,
and
it
thought
that
it
would
simply
be
a
pointless
exercise
for
eastern
enterprises
to
be
required
to
pay
the
premium
and
then
to
go
to
the
court
of
federal
claims
and
get
the
exact
same
amount
of
money
back.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
suggested
that
there
are
a
whole
host
of
reasons--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that's
--
that's
--
they
are
clearly
wrong
about
that,
and
i
--
but
i
think
however
you
characterize
that
defect,
it
defeats
this
dollar-for-dollar
pointless
exercise
point
that
apfel--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
i
think
there
were
two
things
going
on
in
apfel
and
there
were
really
two
distinct
reasons
why
the
plurality
in
apfel
thought
that
there
was
no
requirement
to
go
to
the
tucker
act
there.
one
was
that
it
thought
that
in
a
statute
like
that,
that
simply
allocated
benefits
and
burdens
among
private
entities,
congress
would
not
have
intended
there
to
be
compensation
available
in
the
event
that
there
were
a
taking.
and
that
was
actually
the
government's
position
in
that
case
and
the
apfel
plurality
cited
to
that
portion
of
the
government's
brief.
and
it
cited
cases
in
its
discussion
that
weren't
dollar-for-dollar
or
even
cash
transfer
cases
in
which
the
court
had
gone
to
the
merit
of
takings
claims
without
consideration
of
a
tucker
act
remedy.
then
there
is
the
second
idea,
which
is
the
cash
transfer
idea.
and
we
think
that
the
dollar-for-dollar
aspect
of
that
was
important
to
the
plurality's
analysis
because
it
viewed
that
as
evidence
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
the
tucker
act
to
be
deployed,
because
it
would
have
been
a
pointless
exercise.
so
it
really
went
to
what
congress's
intent
was.
here,
of
course,
for
myriad
reasons,
that
dollar-for-dollar
analysis
breaks
down.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
sure.
justice
breyer,
we've
now
shifted
back
to
the
--
the
first
theory
about
the
property,
which
is
the
raisins.
what
they
could
have
done
in
2002,
would
they
have
been
a
producer
of
raisins,
solely
a
producer
of
raisins
for
decades,
at
any
point
during
--
between
1969
and
2002,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
court
of
claims
and
said,
this
reserve
requirement,
the
taking
of
my
raisins,
i
want
my
just
compensation.
that
is
not
just
a
remedy,
as
mr.
mcconnell
suggests,
it
is
a
constitutional
condition
on
the
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use.
as
long
as
there's
just
compensation,
there
simply
is
no
violation.
so
that's
why--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--justice
scalia,
i
have
two
--
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
these
claims
have
been
litigated
in
the
court
of
claims;
the
evans
case,
the
cal-almond
case,
both
of
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
raisin
producers,
or
in
the
cal-almond
case
it
was
an
almond
producer,
went
to
the
court
of
claims
and
said
this
reserve
requirement
is
a
taking,
i
want
my
money.
and
they
lost;
the
court
of
claims
--
correctly,
in
our
view
--
held
that
there
was
no
taking.
that
said,
we
do
agree
that
it
is
actually
a
close
question
whether
congress
would
have
intended
compensation
to
be
provided
in
a
situation
like
this
one
in
the
event
the
raisin
reserve
program
were
found
to
be
a
taking.
we've
said
--
we've
said
in
our
brief,
we
do
view
that
as
a
close
question,
although
on
balance,
we
think
that
the
proper
answer
is
that
there
is
a
remedy
--
or,
sorry,
there
is
just
compensation
available
in
the
court
of
claims.
but
there
are
cases,
justice--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
we
do
agree
that
it's
a
close
question
for
the--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
of
course,
congress
didn't
think
this
was
a
taking.
and
it
--
and
it
built
considerable
administrative
flexibility
into
the
statute,
and
at
the
end
of
the
day,
that's
what
convinces
us
that
congress
would
not
have
intended
to
preclude
compensation
in
the
court
of
claims
and
to
--
to
opt
for
an
injunction
instead,
because
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
wide
latitude
to
adjust.
so
the
compensation
wouldn't
be
paid
year
after
year,
as
your
hypothetical
suggested.
the
program
could
be
adjusted.
a
reserve
requirement
is
only
one
way
of
complying
with
the
kind
of
supply
control
provisions
of
the
statute.
there
are
any
number
of
options
available.
but
i'd
also
point
out
that
in
this
court's
precedence
in
monsanto
and
regional
rail,
those
were
both
statutory
schemes
which
had
their
own
compensation
mechanism,
as
does
this
one,
this
reserve
raisins
that
producers
do
get
paid
sometimes
for
them
in
a
smaller
amount.
those
were
cases
in
which
the
statutes
did
have
compensation
mechanisms,
and
this
court
held
that
the
tucker
act
was
available
as
kind
of
a
supplementary
compensation
in
the
event--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--justice
ginsburg,
i
think
this
goes
back
again
to
the
property
question.
if
the
claim
is
that
it's
unconstitutional
because
it
takes
producers'
property,
they
can't
raise
that
in
this
proceeding.
if
the
property
is
the
raisins,
they
can't
raise
that
in
this
proceeding.
they
need
to
--
to
comply
and
go
to
the
court
of
claims
for
compensation,
which
means
there
has
been
no
--
in
the
event
there's
a
taking,
it's
a
constitutional
taking
because
just
compensation
is
provided.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
if
the
claim
--
if
the
claim
is
that
the
money
that
was
taken
from
me,
the
fine,
that
itself
is
a
taking,
then
we
think
that
claim
can
and
must
be
brought
in
the
context
of
the
amaa
proceeding.
that
was
not
how
the
court
of
appeals
understood
the
claim
here
to
be,
and
there's
no
precedent
for
the
idea
that
a
fine
for
violation
of
law
can
be
articulated
as
a
taking
of
the
lawbreaker's
property
without
just
compensation.
i
haven't
seen
any
case
that
--
that
stands
for
that
proposition
and
that
would
be
quite
remarkable.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--but,
justice
kennedy,
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
understand
the
taking
claim
to
be
that
the
fine
for
my
violation
of
law
is
a
taking
of
my
money.
that's
not
how
the
ninth
circuit
understood
the
claim,
so
they
didn't
analyze
it
in
that
way.
they
understood
the
claim
to
be
that
the
taking
of
producers'
raisins
is
a
taking,
and
we
lawfully
resisted
it
because
it
was
an
unconstitutional
taking.
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
rejected
that
because
there
was
nothing
unconstitutional
about
it
because
it
was
not
without
just
compensation.
the
tucker
act
is
the
just
compensation.
this
court
has
held--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--justice
breyer,
and
that
goes
to
the
--
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
the
consequence
of
that
is
they
reinstate
our
prior
victory
in
the
prior
panel
opinion--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
they
did
consider
the
matter
fully.
in
the
initial
opinion,
they
said
there's
no
taking
here.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
so
all
of
the
discussion
we're
having
here
is
about
--
is
predicated
on
the
idea
that
if
there
were
a
taking,
would
compensation
be
available
in
the
first
place.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
agree
there's
no
taking.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
no,
because
of
the
way
that
the
statute
and
the
regulatory
program
works.
if
the
handler
is
actually
buying
raisins
from
the
producer,
the
handler
never
takes
title
to
the
reserve
raisins.
and
he
doesn't
pay
for
the
reserve
raisins.
he
takes
title
to
the
free-tonnage
raisins
and
the
title
to
the
reserve
raisins
passes
as
a
matter
of
law
from
the
producer
to
the
raisin
administrative
committee.
the
handler
never
owns
those
raisins.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
they
would
never
pay
for
those
--
they
would
never
pay
for
those
raisins
because
they
can't
take
title.
they
can't
lawfully
take
title
to
those
raisins.
now--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--and
there
absolutely
is.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
but
the
handler's
property
is
not
being
taken,
and
that's
critical.
there
are
separate
takings
claims
that
handlers
have
advanced
that
--
that
could
be
asserted
through
this
process.
for
instance,
there
was
a
case
called
lion
raisins
from
the
federal
circuit
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
in
which
the
issue
was
that
the
handler
provided
bins
to
store
the
raisins,
and
he
didn't
get
his
bins
back.
okay?
that
was
a
handler
takings
claim,
and
that
had
to
be
asserted
in
the
context
of
this
handler
review
scheme.
but
the
handler
doesn't
own
the
raisins
under
this
scheme.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
no,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
goes
to
the
scope,
the
capacity
question
that
we
were
talking
about
before,
because
the
statute
is
quite
clear
in
section
608c(13)(b)
that
this
scheme
does
not
regulate
producers
in
their
capacity
as
producers.
and
if
someone
wants
to
take
on
both
roles,
they
will
be
regulated
only
as
a
handler.
so
the
regulatory
obligations
that
applied
to
petitioners
when
they
adopted
this
business
model
were
handler-only
regulatory
obligations,
and
then
this
is
a
handler
judicial
review
proceeding.
that's
a
very
narrow
means
of
decision
here
that
avoids
some
of
these
kind
of
conceptual
questions
about
the
nature
of
the
takings
clause,
which
is
that
this
claim
simply
doesn't
belong
in
this
proceeding.
but
there's
no
unfairness
or
no
due
process
issue
here
at
all,
because
they
--
in
2002,
when
--
when
petitioners
decided
to
engage
in
this,
these
regulatory
violations
in
order
to
secure
an
unfair
advantage
over
their
competitors,
as
was
found
by
the
alj
at
ja41,
at
that
point
they
could
have
sought
compensation
for
the
past
6
years
of
raisins
that
they
had
provided.
they
didn't
do
it.
i
don't
understand
why
they
didn't
do
it.
they
left
that
claim
on
the
table.
and
to
the
extent
they
wanted
to
claim
going
forward,
they
could
have
continued
to
use
compliant
handlers
and
sued
every
month
for
compensation
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
the
prior
panel
opinion,
justice.
if
--
if
there
was
a
remand
on
the
basis
that
the
ninth
circuit
misunderstood
this
as
a
jurisdictional
article
iii
defect,
and
then
the
ninth
circuit
were
to
find
waiver,
what
the
ninth
circuit
presumably
would
do
would
be
to
reinstate
its
first
panel
decision,
which
we
think
was
also
correct
and
held
that
there
was
no
taking
here.
there
are
two--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--that
would
certainly
be
an
available
option,
or
the
ninth
circuit
could
decide
for
itself
whether
there
had
been
a
waiver.
but
there's
a
separate
issue
in
that
there's
this
capacity
issue,
which
is
a
separate
point
that
the
ninth
circuit
made
at
ja305,
when
it
pointed
out
that
this
was
a
producer
claim,
and
that's
something
that
was
strictly
a
producer
claim
and
wasn't
--
wasn't
a
fit
for
this
handler
review
action,
and
that's
something
that
could
also
be
considered
on
remand.
but
the
consequence
of
this
--
of
that
would
be
for
the
--
the
court
to
impose
its
--
if
it
found
a
waiver,
to
rule
for
us
for
separate
merits
reasons.
we
do
view
the
tucker
act
--
the
failure
to
seek
just
compensation
--
as
a
merits
defect
in
the
petitioners'
claim
here.
so
even
putting
this
capacity
problem
aside,
there
is
simply
--
there's
no
defense.
mr.
mcconnell
says
this
can
be
raised
as
a
defense.
but
there
is
no
defense
if
all
you
show
is
that
there
has
been
a
taking
of
private
property
for
public
use,
full
stop.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
“
acquire
”
is
a
defined
term,
and
it
includes
to
possess.
so
they
took
to--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--there
was
no
question
under
the
regulatory
scheme
here
that
petitioners
were
handlers.
and
in
fact,
there's
a
surprising--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--“
acquire
”
--
“
acquire
”
is
defined
to
include
a
number
of
things,
including
to
possess.
and
a
handler
is
anyone
who
sells
raisins.
there
was
no
mystery
about
this.
and
in
fact
at
pages
8
through
11
of
our
brief,
we
cite
communication
after
communication
where
usda--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--no,
i
don't
think
a
bailee
could.
i
think
the
owner
would
have
to
assert
that
claim,
right.
but
“
acquire
”
is
a
defined
term,
and
as
this
case
comes
to
this
court
it's
accepted.
the
petitioner
has
not
sought
cert
on
the
underlying
regulatory
findings.
in
fact,
their
arguments
--
they
were
told
ahead
of
time
that
they
were
completely
wrong
over
and
over
and
over
again,
and
then
they
lost
that
claim
at
every
level,
twice
within
the
department
of
agriculture,
in
the
district
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
lost
on
that
regulatory
claim.
this
wasn't
a
good
faith
misunderstanding.
if
you
look
at
ja41,
the
alj
found
that
this
was
a
willful
and
intentional,
knowing
violation
of
regulatory
requirements,
because
they
were
able
to
undercut
their
competitors
by
not
playing
by
the
rules.
so
this
doesn't
present
any
kind
of
due
process--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i
--
i
disagree
that
they
have
standing
to
make
those
other
people's
claims.
and
also,
petitioners
haven't
argued,
haven't
made
any
third-party
standing
argument
here.
but
--
this
court's
requirements
are
quite
strict
for
third-party
standing.
you
have
to
have
a
close
--
a
close
relationship,
and
i
don't
think
a
mere
arm's-length
commercial
relationship
would
count.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
if--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
they
have
--
they
certainly
have
standing
as
producers
to
raise
the
claim.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes,
that--
justice
kennedy
--
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
taking?
in
the
court
of
claims,
absolutely,
as
producers.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
that
they
would
have
standing,
but
it's
still
a
claim
that's
beyond
the
scope
of
this
narrow
specific
judicial
review
proceeding.
i
think
it's
a
different
problem.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
i'm
not
going
to
resist
that
too
strenuously,
--
but
i
think
if
they
did
decide
the
question,
they
decided
it
correctly.
it
was
a
threshold
defect.
their
analysis
was
all
correct.
so
i
think
that's
before
the
court.
but
yes,
we
--
we
frankly
acknowledge
and
we
acknowledged
in
our
brief
that
we
did
not
--
we
did
suggest
below
that
this
was
a
jurisdictional
defect.
ninth
circuit
authority
said
that
it
was
and
we
relied
on
that.
we
now
believe
that
it's
best
understood
not
as
a
jurisdictional
defect,
but
as
a
substantive
defect
in
the
claims,
not
simply
a
choice
of
remedies
issue,
as
petitioners
suggests,
because
choice
of
remedy
suggests
that
there
has
been
a
constitutional
wrong
and
that
we
need
to
decide
what
remedy
is
going
to
be
available,
an
injunction
or
damages.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
we
--
we
think
you
could
reach
some
of
the
merits.
we
think
that
the
narrow
disposition
here
is
the
capacity--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes.
our
position
is
that
we're
not
acquiescing
in
a
--
in
a
remand.
we
think
you
can
affirm,
and
you
should
affirm.
however,
i
do
recognize--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
“
merits
”.
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
there
is
the
taking
--
no.
there
is
the
underlying
kind
of
takings
claim,
that
there
was
--
was
there
a
taking
here
at
all.
and
that's
not
before
the
court.
i
don't
think
anyone
suggests
that
that's
before
the
court.
but
we
do
--
we
do
think
that
there
are
a
series
of
other
threshold
defects
in
the
claim
that
this
court
could
--
could
rely
on.
