justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
this
is
one
of
those
difficult
merits
questions
you
were
alluding
to,
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
there's
jurisdiction,
but
to
whether
the
claim
of
a
taking
can
be
asserted
by
the
partnership
in
question,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
it
goes
to
jurisdiction,
which
is
the
only
question
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
some
of
the
raisins
were
their
own.
some
of
the
raisins
were
their
own.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
as
to
that,
that
wouldn't
be
true,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
--
why
does
it
withdraw
for
the
one
and
not
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
mean
the
policy.
i
don't
mean
the
policy
reason.
what
in
the
law
leads
you
to
that
conclusion?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
first?
i
forgot
the
first
already.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
isn't
jurisdictional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
really
confused.
you
are
saying
there
ought
to
be
a
remand
here
because
the
question
is
not
jurisdictional,
which
is
just
what
your
friend
says,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
two
of
you
are
in
agreement
it
ought
to
go
back
to
the
ninth
circuit,
they
should
do
it
on
the
merits,
and
--
and
if
that's
wrong,
we
can
review
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
part
of
that
penalty
was,
you
know,
your
raisins
or
your
life,
right?
i
mean,
it
was--
[laughter]
--you
don't
have
to
pay
the
penalty
if
you
give
us
the
raisins.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
they
--
is
that
right,
they
have
to
give
the
raisins?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
amounts
to
the
same
thing,
your
raisins
or
the
penalty,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
couldn't
be
what
the
statute
meant.
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer
says.
did
--
did
congress
create
a
statute
in
which
we're
going
to
take
your
raisins
and
then
you
can
go
to
the
court
of
claims
and
get
your
money
back.
i
mean,
that
--
that
surely
is
not
what
congress
contemplated.
the
--
the
whole
notion
of
the
program
is
you
can't
get
your
money
back
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
if
you're
raising
a
constitutional
objection,
that's
something
else.
that
should
be
done
in
district
court.
but
to
say
that
congress
contemplated,
you
know,
we'll
take
your
raisins
and
then
you
sue
in
the
court
of
claims,
they
give
you
your
money
back.
that's
a
weird
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
--
you
think
that's
a
close
question?
you
think
that
the
way
the
statute
is
supposed
to
operate,
once
it
is
held
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
taking,
is
that
every
year,
the
government
takes
the
raisins
and
every
year,
the
grower
goes
to
the
court
of
claims
and
gets
the
money
back
for
the
raisins.
is
that
the
program
that
congress
anticipated?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
close
at
all.
that's
a
crazy
statute.
every
year
we're
going
to
take
raisins
and
every
year
we're
going
to
pay
you
in
the
court
of
claims.
what's
the
purpose
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
a
merits
question
again.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
you
--
you
can
resist
on
the
basis
of
a
takings
claim.
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
are
going
to
win.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
bailee?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
suppose
a
bailee
could,
a
bailee
of
the
car.
