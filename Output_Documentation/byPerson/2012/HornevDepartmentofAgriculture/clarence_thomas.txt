this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
during
the
great
depression,
congress
enacted
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937,
i
will
refer
just
as
the
marketing
agreement
act.
this
act
stabilized
--
was
act
--
was
inducted
to
--
enacted
to
stabilize
agricultural
commodity
prices.
california
raisins
are
one
of
the
many
commodities
regulated
by
the
act.
pursuant
to
the
marketing
agreement
act,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
issued
regulations
creating
the
raisin
administrative
committee.
each
year
the
raisin
administrative
committee
recommends
whether
to
place
a
percentage
of
the
raisin
crop
in
a
so-called
reserve
pool
that
is
not
sold
on
the
open
market.
if
a
reserve
pool
is
established,
raisin
handlers
are
required
to
set
aside
a
portion
of
the
raisins
they
receive
from
procedures
and
hold
them
in
the
pool.
procedures
receive
no
upfront
compensation
for
these
raisins.
the
raisin
administrative
committee
then
decides
whether
to
give
the
raisins
away
or
sell
them
in
foreign
markets.
petitioners
are
california
raisin
growers
who
became
frustrated
with
this
regulatory
scheme.
since
the
regulations
apply
only
to
raisin
handlers,
petitioners
decided
to
process
and
sell
their
own
raisins
without
using
a
third-party
handler
in
an
effort
to
avoid
the
requirement
that
they
contribute
raisins
to
the
reserve
pool.
they
also
agreed
to
process
raisins
from
60
other
farms.
the
department
of
agriculture
determined
that
petitioners
were
raisin
handlers
and
demanded
that
they
turn
over
the
requisite
percentage
of
raisins.
after
petitioners
refused
the
department
of
agriculture
initiated
administrative
proceedings,
seeking
civil
penalties
and
reimbursement
for
the
raisins
that
petitioner
refused
to
surrender.
petitioners
argued
that
they
were
producers
not
handlers
and
therefore
did
not
have
to
give
up
the
raisins.
they
also
argue
that
the
raisin
regulations
violated
the
fifth
amendment
prohibition
against
taking
property
without
just
compensation.
an
administrative
law
judge
found
that
petitioners
were
handlers
and
that
they
had
violated
the
raisin
regulations.
he
imposed
fines
and
rejected
petitioner's
takings
defense.
on
appeal,
a
judicial
officer
agreed,
petitioners
then
sought
review
in
federal
district
court
which
concluded
that
petitioners
were
handlers
rather
than
producers
and
rejected
petitioner's
takings
claims
on
the
merits.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
it
agreed
that
petitioners
were
handlers
but
concluded
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
takings
claims
because
it
was
not
right.
according
to
the
ninth
circuit,
petitioners
raised
their
takings
claims
as
producers,
not
handlers,
and
thus
were
required
to
pay
the
fines
and
then
file
suit
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
although,
petitioners
argued
before
the
agency
that
they
were
producers
and
thus
not
subject
to
the
raisin
regulations,
both
the
agency
and
the
district
court
concluded
that
they
were
handlers.
because
the
raisin
regulations
imposed
duties
on
petitioners
only
in
their
capacity
as
handlers,
petitioner's
takings
claims,
to
raise
as
a
defense
against
fines
imposed
for
violating
those
duties
is
necessarily
raised
in
that
same
capacity.
in
finding
otherwise,
the
ninth
circuit
confused
petitioner's
statutory
argument
that
they
were
producers
with
their
constitutional
argument
that
even
assuming
they
were
handlers
defines
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
as
a
result,
the
relevant
question
is
whether
a
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
a
takings
defense
raised
by
a
handler.
petitioners
were
subject
to
final
agency
order
imposing
fines
and
thus
suffered
an
injury
sufficient
for
article
iii
jurisdiction.
the
government
argues
that
petitioners'
claim
is
unripe
because
the
tucker
act
affords
them
a
remedy.
the
tucker
act
normally
requires
people
who
want
or
individuals
who
want
to
sue
the
united
states
for
damages
to
bring
their
suits
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
however,
when
a
statute
contains
its
own
self-executing
remedial
scheme,
tucker
act
jurisdiction
is
replaced
by
that
scheme.
in
this
case
we
conclude
that
the
marketing
agreement
act
provides
such
a
comprehensive
remedial
scheme
and
that
nothing
in
the
marketing
agreement
act
bars
handlers
from
raising
constitutional
defenses
to
the
department
of
agriculture's
--
department
of
agriculture's
enforcement
action.
accordingly,
petitioners
are
free
to
raise
their
takings
claims
in
these
proceedings.
indeed
it
would
make
little
sense
to
force
a
party
to
pay
an
assessed
fine
in
one
proceeding
and
then
turn
around
and
sue
for
recovery
of
that
same
money
in
another.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
