justice

sotomayor
could
i
--
could
i
just
stop
you
on
a
factual
matter--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
it
has
confused
me.
as
i
look
at
the
captions
of
the
cases,
there
appear
to
be
two
different
partnerships:
one
partnership
known
as
raisin
--
doing
business
as
raisin
valley
farms
--
has
mr.
horne
and
his
wife
as
the
partners.
lassen
valley,
the
producer
--
not
the
producer,
the
handler
--
has
four
other:
the
hornes
plus
two
other
people.
so
who
owns
the
raisins?
isn't
that
the
first
partnership
of
the
husband
and
wife?
and
isn't
the
handler
a
second
partnership
that
does
the
business
of
handling?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
estates
have
been
substituted.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
isn't
it
two
legal
entities,
one
who
owns
and
one
who
handles?
one
partnership
produces,
one
partnership
handles?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
don't
care
if
they
did
or
they
didn't.
i
mean,
we
should
know.
are
they
two
separate
legal
entities?
one
who
produces--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
that's
--
you
know,
in
the
cat
--
you
get
some
limited
liability
by
creating
separate
entities,
so
the
creature
who
owns
is
one
partnership,
and
the
--
and
the
entity
that
produces,
that
handles,
is
a
second
one.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
does
to
my
mind,
because
what
is
the
claim,
assuming
that
the
producer
owns
--
the
producer
entity
owns
the
raisins.
what
exactly
is
being
taken
from
the
handlers?
is
it
the
percentage
--
it
can't
be
the
raisins
because
they
don't
own
them.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
--
what
do
they
own?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
it
that's
being
taken
from
the
handler
entity?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
go
back.
what
is
the
--
what
was
taken
from
them
--
you're
saying
it's
just
the
fine,
that
the
fine
is
a
taking
or
--
what
was
the
interest
that
they're
claiming
was
taken
by
the
government?
they
didn't
own
the
raisins,
so
they
get
paid
a
fee
for
handling.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
problem
is
that
they
weren't
entitled
to
that
money,
meaning
they
had
to
pay
it
over
to
the
producer.
the
producer
was
going
to
pay
them
a
handling
fee,
but
that
money
didn't
belong
to
them.
it
belonged
to
the
producers
who
supplied
them
with
the
raisins
and
expected
payment
for
them--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
they
were
sold
in
the
ordinary
course.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
horne
model,
the
handlers
buy,
buy
the
free
raisins
and
then
pay
the
producers,
is
that
what
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--oh.
so
that's
the
difference
in
this
model;
they
don't
take
title
to
the
raisins
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
let
me
--
let
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
is
--
what
is
the
value
in
permitting
a
party
who
doesn't
own
property
to
raise
a
taking
claim
on
behalf
of
other
people?
meaning,
doesn't
the
system
have
an
interest
in
ensuring
that
people
comply
with
their
legal
obligations,
and
to
the
extent
that
you
choose
to
violate
the
law
the
way
they
have
here,
that
the
fine
is
punitive
and
not
compensatory.
meaning
you
don't
own
the
raisins,
but
you
were
obligated
to
put
raisins
aside
for
someone
else.
you
were
their
agent
and
you
failed
to
meet
a
government
obligation
that
was
independently
on
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
go
back
to
my
question:
what
was
the
taking?
since
you
didn't
own
the
raisins,
the
taking
is
the
fine
is
what
you
want
to
call
the
taking.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they're
not
your
raisins.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
mcconnell,
in
--
in
--
if
the
producers
had
decided
to
challenge
this
as
a
tucker
act
violation,
they
would
have
had
to
hand
over
the
raisins?
or
could
they
have
just
held
on
to
the
raisins
and
said,
i'm
not
handing
it
over
until
i
get
just
compensation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
point
is
that
under
a
normal
takings
claim,
you
have
to
hand
over
your
property,
you've
lost
the
value,
and
you
want
the
government
to
pay
it
back
to
you,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
can
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--all
right.
it
almost
seems
to
me,
and
i'll
ask
mr.
mcconnell
when
he
gets
up
at
rebuttal,
that
there
is
some
sort
of
due
process
challenge
going
on
here
that's
been
created
by
the
labels
they
did
in
this
new
situation
--
in
this
new
business
venture.
in
the
normal
situation,
the
handler,
i'm
being
told,
would
actually
have
title
to
the
raisins,
and
they
would
pay
the
producers
for
the
raisins.
so
there
would
be
property
taking.
in
that
situation,
where
the
handlers
actually
own
the
property,
would
they
be
able
to
raise
a
taking
defense?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
are
missing
a
business
opportunity,
because
they
can't
take
title
to
those
raisins.
and
yet
you're
asking--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--this
really
does
sound
to
me
--
and
i
think
that
both
justice
scalia
and
breyer
now
are
being
more
and
more
convinced
--
there
has
to
be
a
place
to
challenge
this
scheme.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
whether
it's
a
taking
--
whether
there's
a
takings
claim
f.
or
the
handler,
because
the
handler
is
being
asked
to
do
things--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
short
answer
is,
yes,
reach
the
merits
only
if
i
win.
that
--
that's
really
what
you
want
us
to
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
i
need
to
ask
you
this
question,
because
do
you
want
us
to
reach
the
merits
if
we're
going
to
have
you
lose?
you
got
to
want
one
or
the
other.
do
you
want
us
to
reach
the
merits,
period,
is
really
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
we
should
reach
the
merits,
which
is
a
very
different
question?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
only
if
you
win,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
they've
conceded
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
handlers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
and
so
they've
conceded
there
is
no--
