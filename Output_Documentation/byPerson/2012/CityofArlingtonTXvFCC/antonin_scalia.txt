justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't,
because
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
so
clear.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
look,
what
you've
told
us
is
jurisdiction
means
a
lot
of
things,
but
what
you
mean
by
it
is
real
jurisdiction,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
chevron
step
zero
jurisdiction.
that
doesn't
clarify
things
very
much
for
me.
what
if
--
what
if
the
statute
in
this
case
said,
the
fcc
shall
have
no
jurisdiction
to
establish
time
limits
within
which
the
states
must
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay?
would
that
be
a
jurisdictional
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
what
if
the
statute
just
said,
the
fcc
shall
not
establish
time
limits
within
which
the
states
must
act.
is
that
jurisdictional?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
in
fact,
i
think
we
have
said
in
--
in
a
number
of
opinions
--
and
certainly
i
have
said
in
a
concurrence
--
that
the
jurisdictional
question,
like
any
other
question,
an
alleged
jurisdictional
question,
like
any
other
one,
is
to
be
decided
with
deference
to
the
agency.
now,
if
you
talk
--
if
you
want
to
limit
your
proposal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
the
--
to
the
entry
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
whether
the
fcc
has
the
jurisdiction
to
administer
the
federal
communications
act,
i
agree
with
you.
i
will
decide
that
without
listening
to
the
fcc.
but
that's
--
that's
a
good
deal
short
of
whether,
given
that
it
does
have
jurisdiction
to
administer
the
federal
communications
act,
its
implementation
of
this
particular
provision
goes
beyond
what
its
authority
is.
that
seems
to
me
a
question
of,
you
can
call
everything
that's
ultra
vires
in
excess
of
the
agency's
jurisdiction,
you
can.
but
that's
not
--
that's
not
what
we
mean
by
the
entry
jurisdictional
question,
does
the
agency
have
authority
to
administer
this
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
no
different
from
our
holding
in
any
case
that
the
agency
has
no
authority
to
issue
this
rule.
it
has
rulemaking
authority,
but
this
rule
goes
too
far,
which
is
to
say
congress
did
not
give
the
agency
authority
to
go
this
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
always
a
question
of
how
much
authority
congress
gave
the
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
say
in
all
of
those
cases,
we
give
no
deference
to
the
agency's
contrary
determination
because
this
is
a
jurisdictional
question?
did
it
say
anything
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
very
often
i
could
decide
a
case
--
you
know,
the
lower
courts
are
running
away
from
the
question
of
deference
vel
non
because
things
have
been
so
confused
by
meade.
so
they
simply
decide
the
question
assuming
no
deference
to
the
agency.
that
doesn't
prove
that
in
that
particular
case
the
agency
wouldn't
have
been
entitled
to
deference.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
it
was
or
not,
it
would
have
come
out
this
way.
so
those
three
cases
don't
prove
what
you
say
they
prove.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
to
that,
i'm
really
surprised
at
your
response
to
justice
kennedy
that
you
agree
that,
even
where
the
agency
has
no
jurisdiction,
although
you
won't
give
chevron
deference,
you
will
give
whatever
the
other
kind
of
deference.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
you
give
skidmore
deference
if
some
non-jurisdictional
agency
comes
in
and
says,
hey,
by
the
way,
court,
you
know,
i
think
this
is
the
right
answer?
oh,
we
will
listen
to
that
respectfully.
we
won't
necessarily
give
you
chevron
--
why
would
you
give
it
any
deference
at
all
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
all
you
think
that
skidmore
deference
means?
you
will
listen
to
opinions
that
make
sense,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
just
to
agency
opinions
it
makes
sense,
not
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
i
didn't
know
that
and
i'm
just
looking
at
the
text,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
innumerable
statutes
which,
after
giving
the
agency
rule-making
authority,
provide
judicial
--
you
know,
review
under
this
statute
shall
be
held
in
such-and-such
a
court.
there
is
no
conflict
whatever
between
a
statement
that
any
person
affected
can
sue
in
federal
court
and
the
possession
by
an
agency
of
rule-making
authority.
the
two
simply
don't
conflict.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
no
better.
louis
jaffe
isn't
even
a
member
of
the
court.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
breyer
would
replace
that
with
a
rule
where
they
like
the
agency
to
have
authority,
it
has
it,
and
where
they
don't
like
it
to
have
authority,
it
doesn't.
i'm
not
sure
that's
any
better
than--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
description
of
the
chevron--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
the
question,
to
tell
you
the
truth.
this
matter
is
not
left
with
the
states.
it's
going
to
be
decided
by
a
federal
instrumentality,
right?
either
by
the
agency,
which
says
30
days
is
the
rule,
or
by
federal
courts,
which
perhaps
could
issue
opinions
that
say
30
days
is
the
rule.
i
mean,
this
--
you
know,
it's
an
interesting
separation
of
powers
question
within
the
federal
government,
but
i
don't
see
how
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
the
states
or
the
federal
government
that's
going
to
call
the
tune
here.
it's
going
to
be
the
federal
government,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
you
think
that
the
issue
of
whether
unelected
federal
bureaucrats
should
decide
it
or
unelected
federal
judges
should
decide
it
is
an
issue
of
separation
of
powers
rather
than
an
issue
of
--
of
federal/state
relations?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
“
reasonable
”
was
what
people
were
talking
about
as
being
ambiguous,
although
i
don't
think
“
ambiguous
”
is
the
proper
word.
“
reasonable
”
is
vague.
you
don't
know
exactly
what
it
means,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
verrilli,
why
isn't
it
an
easy
answer
to
the
whole
case
to
read
(7)(a).
except
as
provided
in
this
paragraph.
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
limit
or
affect
the
authority
of
state
or
local
government?
okay?
and
then
later
in
the
paragraph,
in
the
subsection
entitled
“
limitations
”,
it
says
"a
state
or
local
government
shall
act
on
any
request
for
authorization
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
limitation.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
--
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
a
landmark
administrative
law
case,
chevron
usa
versus
natural
resources
defense
council
established
a
proposition
that
when
statutory
text
is
ambiguous,
courts
will
differ
to
reasonable
resolution
of
that
ambiguity
by
the
agency
charged
with
administering
the
statute.
fifth
circuit
precedent
holds
that
this
deference
principle
applies
even
to
an
agency's
resolution
of
an
ambiguity
pertaining
to
its
own
statutory
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
that
precedent
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
chevron
in
a
court
deference
to
a
dispute
over
the
scope
of
the
federal
communications
commissions'
authority
to
administer
the
communications
act.
we
need
not
dwell
on
the
details
of
that
dispute
which
are
set
forth
in
the
opinion
because
we
granted
certiorari
only
to
answer
a
discreet
question
of
law,
namely,
whether
a
court
should
apply
chevron
to
an
agency's
determination
of
its
own
jurisdiction.
we
hold
that
chevron
applies
equally
whether
or
not
an
agency's
interpretation
of
statute
it
administers
can
be
termed
jurisdictional.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
there
is
no
distinction
between
an
agency's
jurisdictional
and
non-jurisdictional
interpretations.
the
jurisdictional,
non-jurisdictional
line
is
meaningful
in
the
judicial
context
because
congress
has
the
power
to
tell
the
courts
what
classes
of
cases
they
have
the
power
to
decide
that
is
to
define
their
jurisdiction,
but
has
no
power
to
prescribe
how
they
decide
those
cases.
but
for
agencies
charged
with
administering
congressional
statutes,
both
their
power
to
act
and
how
they
are
to
act
is
authoritatively
prescribed
by
congress.
when
they
act
improperly,
no
less
than
when
they
act
beyond
their
jurisdiction,
what
they
do
is
ultra
vires.
when
a
court
reviews
an
agency's
interpretation
of
a
statute
it
administers,
the
question
is
simply
whether
the
agency
has
stayed
within
the
bounds
of
its
statutory
authority.
there
is
no
principle
basis
for
carving
out
an
arbitrary
subset
of
jurisdictional
questions
from
the
chevron
framework.
that
is
why,
as
we
explain
in
our
opinion,
we
have
consistently
afforded
chevron
deference
to
agency's
constructions
of
the
scope
of
their
own
jurisdiction.
a
false
dichotomy
between
jurisdictional
and
non-jurisdictional
agency
interpretations
would
produce
chaos
squared
in
the
federal
courts.
some
judges
would
be
confused,
others
tempted
by
the
prospect
of
making
public
policy
by
fixing
the
meaning
of
ambiguous
statutory
commands.
the
effect
would
be
to
transfer
from
the
agencies
that
administer
statutes
to
judges
any
number
of
interpretive
decisions
arched
at
typical
chevron
questions
about
how
best
to
--
to
construe
an
ambiguous
term
in
light
of
competing
policy
interests.
we
have
caution
that
“judges
ought
to
refrain
from
substituting
their
own
interstitial
lawmaking”
for
that
of
an
agency.
that
is
precisely
what
chevron
prevents
and
what
a
jurisdictional
exception
to
chevron
would
allow.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
kennedy
and
alito
joined.
