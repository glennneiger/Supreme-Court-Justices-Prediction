mr.
goldstein,
could
you
go
back
to
the
question
presented?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
read
a
lot
of
briefs
in
this
case
and
i
don't
have
any
idea
what
to
tell
a
lower
court,
how
to
articulate
the
tests
or
how
to
apply
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
given
that
you
started
with
saying
it's
almost
impossible
to
talk
about
what's
jurisdictional
and
what's
an
application
of
jurisdiction.
so
articulate
the
test
and
tell
me
what
i
tell
the
lower
courts.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that's
what
the
court
here
did.
it
looked
at
the
communications
act,
it
said,
it
has
the
power--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
pass
regulations
with
respect
to
this
act.
there
is
no
clear
exception.
i
still
haven't
quite
understood,
other
than
in
the
academic
literature,
what
the
difference
between
step
zero
and
step
one
is,
and
so
there
is
an
ambiguity
and
now
the
agency
is
given
deference.
so
where
in
this
conversation
is
there--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
general,
let's
go
back
to
the
question
presented
and
break
down
your
argument.
is
it
your
position
that
what
the
court
asks
first
is
whether
congress
has
spoken
clearly
on
the
agency
having
authority
or
not?
is
that
subject
to
de
novo
review?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
but
tell
me
what
gets
deference
when
and
what's
subject
to
de
novo
review.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
deal
with
the
three
cases
he
mentioned.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general,
if
the
agency
had
said
reasonable
is
30
days,
period,
and
not
done
what
it
did,
which
was
create
a
rebuttable
presumption,
would
that
have
been
appropriate?
would
we
have
had
to
uphold
that?
and
if
not,
i
think
--
how
would
we
have
struck
it
down?
what
step?
