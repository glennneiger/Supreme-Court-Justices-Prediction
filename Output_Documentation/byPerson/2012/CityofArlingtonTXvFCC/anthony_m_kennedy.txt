are
there
some
statutes
where
parts
of
the
statute
are
subject
to
agency's
chevron
rulemaking
authority,
and
its
zero
plus
one
jurisdiction
and
other
parts
are
not?
you
just
mentioned
the
case
by
justice
scalia,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
involved
that,
because
it
does
seem
to
me
just
reading
through
that
“
reasonable
time
”,
that
sounds
like
something
that
--
where
we
can
have
a
specific
elaboration
of
what
it
means.
and
to
say
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
agency
or
the
authority
of
the
agency
does
not
extend
to
rules
seems
a
little
odd
at
first.
i
recognize
the
federalism
problems
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
could
you
add
that
in
those
three
cases,
or
at
least
meade,
some
respect
was
given
to
the
agency's
due.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
just
not
the
sort
of
deference
that
--
under
chevron.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
might
also
have
said,
it
seems
to
me,
that
that
assumes
the
issue,
assumes
the
premise.
the
question
is,
is
there
jurisdiction
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
say
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
why
do
you
give
deference,
that
assumes
the
very
step,
the
very
question
we
are
trying
to
resolve.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
wouldn't
know
when
to
go
to
court.
let
me
ask
you
this:
suppose
there
is
a
provision
of
this
statute
which
is
very
difficult
to
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
bear
on
the
chevron
step
zero
analysis
on
the
question
of
what
you
call
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
ginsburg
identifies
a
real
point.
i
was
looking
at
this
statute
and
i
say,
you
know,
how
do
i
know
when
this
agency
has
failed
to
act?
i
don't
--
that's
just
a
very
obscure
data
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that
at
209?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
--
as
to
that
specific
provision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
agencies
have
no
historic
responsibility
or
tradition,
quite
unlike
article
iii
courts,
of
safeguarding
the
federal
balance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
unelected
federal
bureaucrats.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
chevron
is
at
an
end.
it's
unravelled.
