mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
very
much.
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
can
get
complicated
quickly
because
the
word
“
jurisdiction
”
means
a
lot
of
different
things
to
a
lot
of
different
people
in
a
lot
of
different
contexts,
and
the
parties
have
advanced
both
broad
and
narrow
theories
for
resolving
the
case.
so
the
thing
i
can
do
most
helpfully
at
the
beginning,
i
think,
is
to
frame
where
i
believe
the
real
dispute
in
the
case
lies.
the
fcc
claims
the
authority
to
interpret
section
332(c)(7)
of
the
communications
act
with
the
force
of
law,
and
my
argument
today
is
limited
to
the
question
--
that
threshold
jurisdictional
question,
which
we
call
interpretive
jurisdiction,
iowa
utilities
called
it
underlying
jurisdiction,
law
professors
like
to
call
it
chevron
step
zero,
but
that's
what
i'm
focused
on.
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
on
that
question,
the
fcc
gets
chevron
deference.
and
that
is,
it
gets
to
decide
whether
it
has
the
authority
to
interpret--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
question
on
which
you
granted
certiorari
was
how
to
decide
that
question,
not
what
is
the
answer
to
that
question.
what
the
fifth
circuit
did,
acknowledging
a
circuit
conflict,
was
decided
that
the
fcc's
assertion
that
you
are
right
is
itself
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
i--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
breyer,
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it.
i
do--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
appreciate
it.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
things
you
want
to
hear
me
talk
about.
i
am
very
conscious
of
the
fact,
let
me
say,
that
the
court
limited
this
grant
of
certiorari
to
the
first
question
presented,
which
was
the
abstract
chevron
question,
so
i
just
don't
want
to
jump
the
gun--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
ginsburg,
you
and
justice
breyer
have
both
asked
me
to
turn
to
that
question,
so
i'm
going
to
do
it.
the
only
point
i'm
making
is
that
all
of
these
questions
assume
that
we
are
right
on
the
question
presented,
which
i
think
we
obviously
are.
so
i'm
happy
to
move
on,
but
i
just
did
not
want
to
hurry
past
the
legal
question
on
which
you
granted
certiorari.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
all
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
mean
--
what
i
mean
by
it--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
would.
that
would
be--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
a
different
kind
of
jurisdictional
question.
it
is
a
jurisdictional
question.
justice
scalia,
so
maybe
i
can
help
you,
just
on
the
question
of
what
i'm
talking
about
and
whether
i
can
draw
--
whether
i
can
draw
my
line,
or
whether
it's
just
malleable,
and
every
court's
going
to
get
drawn
into
it,
which
i
suspect
you
may
be
concerned
about.
okay?
the
kind
of
jurisdiction
i'm
talking
about
is
what
you
called
in
your
iowa
utilities
opinion
for
the
court
“
underlying
jurisdiction
”,
and
in
iowa
utilities,
in
the
discussion
of
the
fcc's
underlying
jurisdiction,
you
undertook
the
judicial
task
of
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute
and
figuring
out
that
congress
did
intend,
along
the
lines
of
the
theory
that
justice
ginsburg
just
articulated,
that
the
fcc
did
have
the
power
to
implement
those
provisions
of
the
'96
act.
and
as
we
have
rehearsed,
to
be
honest,
every
one
of
your
chevron
opinions
deals
with
this
question:
just,
did
the
agency
have
the
power
to
interpret
this
statutory
provision
with
the
force
of
law?
you
and
all
of
your
colleagues
from
the
court
have
always
decided
that
question
de
novo.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
justice
scalia,
the
place
where
--
i
do
limit
myself
to
the
entry
point
and
the
place
where
you
and
i
are
going
to
disagree
is
whether
the
entry
point
is
just
the
generic
question,
does
the
fcc
administer
the
whole
act
or
the
somewhat
more
narrow
question,
does
the
fcc
administer
this
statutory
provision.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
okay.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes
and
the
best
example
is
this
statute.
it
is
uncontested
and
incontestable
that
the
fcc
does
not
administer
all
of
the
communications
act.
this
court
so
held
squarely
in
the
louisiana
public
service
commission
case,
in
which
there
congress
added
to
the
communications
act
sections
251
and
252.
and
there
was
a
provision
in
that
statute
that
said
--
that
limited
the
scope
of
the
fcc's
power,
as
we
say
section
332(c)(7)
does.
we
will
have
to
go
through
that
and
debate
that,
but
the
communications
act
is
plainly
--
and
there
are
other
provisions
as
well.
but
the
best
example
is
the
louisiana
psc
case.
and
so--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
correct.
i
would
only
cabinet
it
in
the
following
way.
and
there's
--
the
question
on
which
you
granted
certiorari
is,
does
the
fcc
get
chevron
deference
in
its
assertion
that
it
gets
to
interpret
332(c)(7)
with
the
force
of
law.
i
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
would
be
a
very
easy
jurisdictional
question.
we
rely
on
two
provisions
of
332(c)(7)
to
establish
the
proposition
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
general
rulemaking
authority
in
section
201(b)
of
the
communications
act
to
extend
to
332(c)(7).
and
those
are--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
disagree,
and
i
understand
that
you
have
a
vision
of
how
chevron
deference
operates.
we
disagree
with
it
in
this
respect,
respectfully,
and
that
is,
we
believe
that
every
one
of
this
court's
chevron
precedents
has
started,
sometimes
only
in
a
sentence,
because
often
it's
very
simple
--
often
it's
uncontestable
that
it's
a
provision
of
the
communications
act
that
does
fall
within,
for
example,
the
fcc's
201(b)
authority.
but
it
is
always
as
--
you
have
always
approached
that
question
as
judges,
first,
we
decide
does
the
fcc
have
the
power
to
implement
this
statute?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
kagan,
i
disagree.
i
honestly
disagree.
i'm
going
to
give
you
three
cases
that
i
think
show
i
am
right
and
that
your
articulation
of
your
--
that
approach
is
not
correct.
and
i
encourage
you
to
ask
the
solicitor
general
what
his
best
case
is.
it
may
be
he
thinks
american
hospital,
which
i'll
talk
about.
here
are
my
three
cases:
louisiana
public
service
commission.
provision
by
provision,
the
court
looked
de
novo
at
the
question
of
whether
sections
251
and
252
of
the
communications
act
were
subject
to
the
general
rulemaking
power.
it
said
no.
adams
fruit,
another
case
where
the
secretary
of
labor
had
general
rulemaking
authority
over
the
agricultural
worker
protection
statute.
and
the
court
looked
specifically
at
the
private
right
of
action
and
said:
your
authority
doesn't
extend
here.
and
the
last
one
is
meade,
where
the
customs
service
has
the
general
authority
to
administer
that
statute.
and
instead,
the
court
looked
at
the
specific
provision
involved
and
it
said,
do
you
have
lawmaking
authority
with
respect
to
these
interpretive
rulings?
and
so
it
has
always
done
some--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
did
not.
i
have
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
i
will
tell
you
this,
i
am
not
overclaiming
the
cases.
i
am
describing
what
happened
in
them,
particularly
on
the
axis
of
whether
the
court
went
provision
by
provision.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
let
me
tell
you
why--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--justice
scalia,
here's
why
i
disagree.
i
picked
three
cases
for
a
very
specific
reason,
in
that
each
of
those
three
cases
rejected
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction.
and
so
that
if
chevron
were
applying,
the
court
would
have
had
to
find
that
the
statute
was
unambiguous.
and
it
didn't
do
that
in
any
of
those
cases.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
did.
i
agreed
with
justice
kennedy
vociferously.
that
was
the
end
of
my
answer.
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
i
have
two
--
i
have
three
answers.
they
will
be
brief.
louisiana
public
service
commission
and
adams
fruit
are
as
i
described
them.
the
reason
that
meade
is
helpful
to
me
is
on
a
different
axis
than
you've
described.
and
that
is
that
the
agency
there
had
a
general
--
generally
applicable
authority
in
which
it
could
have
urged
that
its
authority
to
issue
those
rulemakings,
that
it
was
entitled
to
deference
on
its
view
of
its
power
to
issue
rulings
with
the
force
of
law.
but
the
third
thing
that
i
want
to
say
is
let
me
just
take--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--skidmore.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because,
justice
scalia,
skidmore
deference
is,
as
you
know,
of
course
--
and
you
have
been
a
very
powerful
critic
of
it,
obviously,
in
your
opinions
--
that
it
is
the
--
you
give
the
agency
the
respect
of
the
persuasiveness
of
its
opinion.
and
i
took
--
or
i
--
the
part
of
the
comment
that
i
was
agreeing
with
justice
kennedy
was
--
is,
as
justice
ginsburg
has
suggested,
the
fcc
understands
the
communications
act.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
--
the
court
has
--
i
am
quoting
the
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
more
than
makes
sense,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
there
is
a
common
sense
element
to
this,
and
that
is
that
the
fcc,
we
recognize
that
it
has
its
expertise.
the
question
is,
do
we
have
to,
when
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
as
it
will
often
be,
do
we
have
to
accept
as
a
matter
of
law
their
view
that
they
do
have
jurisdiction?
i
do
want
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
all
right.
you
and
justice
breyer
have
encouraged
me
to
get
to
the
merits
question,
so
let
me
turn
the
corner,
if
i
might,
to
how
we
think
a
court
would
look
at
this
question
de
novo.
we
have
two
points.
one
is
the
statutory
provision,
and
this
is
going
to
be
at
pages
1
and
2
of
the
cert
petition,
if
you
have
that
copy
in
front
of
you.
the
statute
--
and
so,
justice
ginsburg,
i
am
going
to
answer
your
question,
but
i
want
to
make
a
couple
of
quick
points
about
our
offensive
argument
about
why
it
is
congress
didn't
intend
the
fcc
to
implement
the
statute
with
the
force
of
law.
it
begins
with
preservation
of
local
zoning
authority.
subsection
(a)
says:
"except
as
provided
in
this
paragraph,
nothing
in
this
act.
"
--which
includes
section
201(b)
--
"shall
limit
or
affect
the
authority
of
a
state
or
local
government
with
respect
to
this
subject
matter.
"
then
in
subsection
(b)(5)
--
justice
ginsburg,
you
said
the
essence
of
the
statute
is
(b).
in
subsection
(b)(5),
congress
located
the
enforcement
power
of
this
statute
in
the
courts.
any
--
and
this
is
it
at
the
bottom
of
2:
"any
person
adversely
affected
by
any
final
action
or
failure
to
act
by
a
state
or
local
government
or
any
instrumentality
thereof--
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--i
could
read
the
whole
thing,
justice
ginsburg.
my
point
is
going
to
be
that
that
“
reasonable
period
of
time
”
phrase
is
enforced
through
the
courts.
now,
congress--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
will
now
turn
to
that
question.
it
makes
enormous
sense
and
it
was
explained
by
the
conferees
in
the
conference
report
at
page
209
of
the
petition
appendix.
and
what
happened
here
is
that
the
house
version
of
the
bill
instructed
the
fcc
to
conduct
a
rule-making
and
the
rule-making
would
set
standards
for
establishing
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
the
senate
came
along,
which
had
no
such
provision
and
said,
no,
we
are
going
to
have
a
provision
that
instead
says
that
nothing
else
in
the
act
will
apply
to
this
question;
that
you
will
go
to
the
courts
rather
than
to
have
a
rule-making.
the
rule-making
must
be
canceled,
and
then
explained
its
intent.
and
so
if
i
could
just
read
that
to
you
very
quickly--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
scalia,
my
point
is
that
it
is
a
point
in
our
favor,
particularly
when
you
compare
--
(b)(5)
has
two
parts,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
history
which
told
the
fcc
to
cancel
the
rule-making
on
this
point.
subsection
(b)(5)
says
you
go
on
the
reasonable
period
of
time
provision,
you
go
to
the
courts;
and
on
questions
related
to
radio
frequency
emissions,
which
is
also
covered
by
(c)(7)(a),
you
go
to
the
fcc.
and
what
the
conferees
explained
quite
clearly,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
you
can
have
two
different
visions
of
what
a
reasonable
period
of
time
is.
and
that
is
a
general
--
this
is
--
the
first
one
is
what
the
fcc
would
expect
to
implement,
and
that
is
a
reasonable
period
of
time
is
a
general
national
standard,
a
kind
of
baseline.
what
they
said
is
a
presumption
of
90
or
150
days.
and
that's
what
we
think
generally
the
fcc
will
decide
how
long
it
takes
to
act
on
a
wireless
application.
or
you
could
think
about
reasonable
period
of
time
as
within
the
locality.
and
that
is,
is
the
locality
following
its
ordinary
standards
for
resolving
siting
applications
and
not
discriminating
against
wireless
applications.
and
that
--
the
latter
is
what
congress
intended,
and
it
makes
every
sense
in
the
world
in
the
context
of
this
statute
that
congress
wanted
that,
because,
first,
it
has
always
been
the
case
that
state
and
local
--
that
wireless
siting
and
all
siting
decisions
are
decided
by
localities,
not
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that,
justice
ginsburg
--
just
to
put
this
in
context,
the
government
says
that
the
fcc
was
concerned
that
the
wireless
companies
wouldn't
know
when
to
go
to
court.
they
cite
no
case
in
which
that
was
ever
an
issue,
neither
the
wireless
companies
nor
them.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
two
things,
justice
kennedy.
first
is,
i
will
tell
you
that
congress
consciously
used
phrases,
“
reasonable
period
of
time
”
and
"substantial
evidence
contained
in
a
written
record.
"
--those
are
the
subdivisions
of
subparagraph
(b),
which
justice
ginsburg
was
pointing
to,
because
those
are
judicially
administered
standards.
and
i
will
just
read
you
one
sentence
from
the
conference
report:
"the
phrase
substantial
evidence
contained
in
a
written
record
is
the
traditional
standard
used
for
judicial
review
of
agency
actions".
"
the
agency
here
being
the
locality.
and,
justice
kennedy,
on
your
question--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
was
at
210,
justice
kennedy.
there
is
a
similar
passage
relating
to
“
reasonable
period
of
time
”.
it's
quite
clear.
i
believe
the
conference
report
is
four
or
five
pages
long.
when
you
have
the
opportunity
to
read
it
again,
i
think
you
will
see
that
congress
was
adopting
local
standards,
a
local
--
a
local
approach
to
deciding
this
question,
against
a
broader
framework.
can
i
just
answer
justice
kennedy's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
lower
courts
decide
de
novo
whether
the
agency
was
given
the
power
to
interpret
a
particular
provision
with
the
force
of
law.
that's
the
entry
point
question,
the
threshold
question.
all
of
this
works--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
did
not--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--here's
where
it
went
wrong.
here's
where
it
went
wrong.
it
looked
to
the
statute,
it
found
the
relationship
between
332(c)(7)
and
201(b)
ambiguous.
and
when
it
found
ambiguity,
then
it
said
it
was
compelled
to
accept
the
fcc's
reading.
it
did
not
resolve
that
ambiguity
itself,
as
it
would
in
any
other
case
involving
statutory
construction.
before
i
sit
down,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
ginsburg
have
raised
the
point
that
the
government
did,
that
when
does
someone
know
when
to
go
to
court?
the
only
part
of
my
answer
i
got
in
was
that
there
are
no
cases
identifying
that
as
a
problem,
and
the
reason
is
that
it's
a
continuing
violation.
no
communications
provider,
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
was
ever
thrown
out
of
court
for
coming
in
too
late,
for
a
failure
to
act,
because
every
day
the
state
and
locality
didn't
act
is
regarded
as
an
alleged
violation
and
it
doesn't
take
away
from
jurisdiction
to
go
to
court.
there
are
no
cases
that
support
their
concern.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i've
heard,
and
i
regret
that
i
have
contributed
to
such
a
horror.
this
is
silliness.
[laughter]
the
court
has
--
we
have
cited
to
you
17
cases
of
yours
in
which
you
have
always
looked
at
the
entry
point
question
de
novo,
and
on
the
idea
that
we're
making
this
more
complicated
makes
no
sense
to
me,
because
what
the
government
wants,
and
you
see
this
in
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
is
a
surround
of
chevron
on
whether
they
have
authority.
go
through
that
entire
process,
and
then
go
through
it
again,
assuming
that
you
do
believe
they
have
that
authority.
there's
not
a
step
that
we're
adding
to
the
inquiry.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
it
is
not.
this
court
has
said
time
and
again,
including
in
meade,
that
the
precondition
to
the
application
of
meade
is
a
determination
that
congress
delegated
authority
to
the
agency
to
interpret
the
statute
with
the
force
of
law.
and
that
has
to
be
asked
in
every
single
case
and
that
is
a
distinct
inquiry.
once
you
decide
that
they
have
that
delegated
authority
over
that
provision,
then,
as
this
court
has
done
in
every
case--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
are
at
loggerheads,
justice
kagan.
i
believe
that
louisiana
public
service
commission
and
adams
fruit
are
just
simply
contrary
to
that.
it
also
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
believe
that
congress
gave
the
agency
this
201(b)
authority
and
then
implicitly
gave
the
agency
the
authority
to
decide
how
far
201(b)
extends.
this
is
just
a
question-begging
exercise.
they
say
we
have
this
general
authority.
i
ask.
does
that
general
authority
apply
to
this
particular
provision
in
the
act,
and
they
say,
well,
our
general
authority
gives
us
the
power
to
answer
even
that
question,
and
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is,
because
i
am
only
asking
the
threshold
question,
did
congress
give
the
agency
the
power
to
interpret
this
statutory
provision
with
a
question
of
law.
and
that
is
a
different
--
i'll
give
you
an
illustration
and
that
is,
there
is
an
extended
discussion
of
this
question
in
the
fcc's
order.
it
had
no
difficulty
identifying
that
as
a
separate
inquiry.
i
did
want
to
just
turn
to
the
merits--
let
me
just
say
that
the
solicitor
general's
argument
about
whether
the
201(b)
authority
extends
to
332(c)(7)
is
a
great
illustration
of
our
argument
on
the
question
presented.
because
that's
a
lawyer's
argument.
there
was
not
a
word
that
my
friend
said
about
there
was
a
technical
question
of
communications
law
and
how
wireless
citing
facilities
operate.
that's
the
kind
of
question
that
congress
gives
to
agencies.
it
is
not
the
threshold
lawyer's
issue,
does
this
statute
read
this
far?
i
would
only
encourage
you
on
the
merits
question,
which
is
not
included
in
the
question
presented,
which
you
didn't
grant
certiorari
on,
that
is,
the
application
of
de
novo
review
to
this
statute
to
pay
more
attention
than
i
think
this
argument
has
given
it,
because
it
wasn't
the
core
issue
briefed
in
the
case,
obviously,
to
what
congress
did
in
this
statute.
there
was
a
version
of
the
statute
that
gave
the
fcc
the
very
authority
that
it
is
claiming
here.
that
was
the
house
version
of
the
bill
that
was
rejected
in
congress
in
conference,
congress
adopted
this
version,
ordered
the
fcc
to
cancel
the
rule-making
and
reserve
this
power
to
the
courts,
the
--
the
authority
to
decide
what
is
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
thank
you.
