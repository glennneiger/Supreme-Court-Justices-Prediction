justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
you
win
on
that,
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
i
--
i
grant
you,
i
don't
see
any
reason
for
that.
the
question
is
just
whether
congress
intended
them
to
have
a
degree
of
discretionary
power.
but
all
the
arguments
that
we
hear
still
count
against
you.
so
if
you
want
to
go
into
the
chevron
step
zero
or
step
minus
alpha
13.6,
i
mean,
fine.
but
i
mean,
at
some
point,
i
will
hope
you
--
i
hope
you
will
go
into
what
i'd
call
the
question
of,
we
have
a
statute
just
as
justice
ginsburg
said.
it's
an
expert
statute.
it
is
a
statute
in
an
agency
that
has
all
kinds
of
discretionary
authority.
it
includes
an
important
substantive
question
about
what
the
relation
is
with
the
cable
television
in
this
area
--
post
--
not
cable,
but,
you
know,
the
broadcast
posts.
and
so
all
these
factors
here
which
suggest,
of
course,
congress,
which
is
not
expert,
would
have
wanted
the
fcc
to
figure
this
one
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
--
at
some
point
--
you
don't
have
to
go
into
it
at
all
if
you
don't
want
to,
but
i
just
want
to
put
that
on
the
table.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
talk
about
it
now,
but
you
can
talk
about
it
whenever
you
want.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
worries
me
about
it
is
you
and
i
both
have
in
our
offices
thousands
of
words
which
are
in
the
u.s.
code
and
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
--
or
millions
of
employees
in
millions
of
different
kinds
of
agencies,
and
if
we
turn
chevron
into
the
tax
code,
it's
going
to
be
a
nightmare
--
in
my
opinion,
not
necessarily
in
that
of
my
colleagues.
so
as
you
know,
i've
written
somewhat
a
different
approach,
and
it
says,
let's
not
do
this.
but
just
so,
who
would
win
here?
suppose
you
just
said,
look,
what
we're
interested
in
is
just
one
question,
whether
congress
wanted
a
court
to
give,
in
this
kind
of
situation,
deference
to
the
agency.
and
the
answer
will
be,
it
depends.
chevron
is
a
good
rule
of
thumb,
but
it
isn't
a
straightjacket.
so
what
you'd
look
at
here
is
it's
the
fcc
that
is
in
charge
of
national
communications,
of
which
this
is
part.
there
is
a
specific
provision,
as
your
colleague
points
out,
that
says
"but
don't
interfere
with
the
states
when
they
are
citing
stuff.
"
but
then
there
is
a
limitation
to
that
specific
provision
which
consists
of
six
or
seven
parts,
all
of
which
maintain
a
lot
of
authority
in
the
fcc
or
rules
about
what
they
are
not
supposed
to
do.
and
then
here
it
uses
the
word
“
reasonable
”.
so
where
you
have
a
federal
agency
with
expertise
that's
in
charge
of
this
kind
of
area
and
they
have
rule-making
authority
and
you
have
a
statute
like
this,
which
is
a
little
bit
ambiguous,
but
not
too,
in
respect
to
the
point
about
whether
they
do
interpretation,
you'd
add
up
those
factors
and
make
a
decision.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
such
a
simple
--
i
mean,
that's
louis
jaffe.
that's
the
founders
of
administrative
law.
that's
everybody
until
we
get
into
a
straightjacket,
and
it
isn't
even
chevron,
doesn't
go
against
us
if
you
don't
think
of
it
as
a
straightjacket.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
make
it
up.
it
was
louis
jaffe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
think
i
can
show,
which
i
will
spare
you
at
the
moment,
all
the
cases
like
meade
are
consistent
with
what
i
said.
and
cases
that
are
not
consistent
are
consistent
with
judge
friendly
said
years
ago,
where
he
said
there
is
no
coherence
to
the
supreme
court's
cases
in
this
area;
when
they
like
a
result,
they
say
they
have
deference,
and
when
they
don't
like
it,
they
say
they
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
--
i'm
sorry
i
brought
this
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
dissented
in
that,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
i
agree
with
you,
this
flows
a
fortiori
from
the
majority.
but
i
didn't
think
--
this
is
what
i
wonder
--
is
--
you
say
unelected
federal
bureaucrats.
administrative
law
is
about
federal
administration.
that
is
federal
administrative
law.
and
i've
heard
here
people
say
we're
talking
about
them
adding
something.
i
didn't
think
that's
what
was
at
issue.
i
thought
that
there
is
a
word
in
the
statute,
“
reasonable
”,
and
what
the
administrators
did
at
the
fcc
was
to
interpret
that
word.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
added?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
reasonable
--
reasonable
is
uncertain
who.
who
has
--
it
doesn't
tell
us
who
has
the
authority.
