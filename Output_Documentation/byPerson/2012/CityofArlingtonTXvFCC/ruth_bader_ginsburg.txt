mr.
goldstein,
this
case
has
been
presented
in
a
very
complicated
way,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we're
dealing
with
is
a
rule
adopted
by
the
commission,
and
the
commission's
rule-making
power,
as
you
know,
is
very
broad.
they
have
power
to
make
the
rules
needed
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
and
332
is
--
counts
as
a
provision
of
the
act.
so
why
isn't
it
just
a
proper
implementation
of
that
rule-making
authority?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
abstract
question
really
isn't
presented.
i
mean,
just
to
follow
on
what
i
asked
you
first,
here
is
a
phrase,
“
a
reasonable
time
”.
and
the
commission
interprets
that
phrase
in
a
reasonable
way.
why
is
this
case
any
more
complicated
than
that?
why
doesn't
the
fcc
have
the
authority
to
interpret
that
term,
within
a
reasonable
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
in
following
that,
it
seems
to
me
you
--
you
are
basing
your
argument
on
what
is
said
in
7(a).
and
that
preserves
the
authority
of
the
local
governments.
but
the
provision
that
we
are
talking
about
is
(b),
and
(b)
says
limitations,
authority
that
the
local
governments
do
not
have,
and
among
those
limitations
is
that
they
have
to
act
within
a
reasonable
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
just
don't
understand
how
the
fcc's
general
rule-making
authority
is
removed
as
to
a
provision
that
limits
what
the
state
and
local
governments
can
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
skipping
over
(2),
which
is
the
phrase
“
reasonable
time
”.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
on
a
practical
level--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
sense
does
it
make
to
read
this
to
say
that
each
time
there
is
a
dispute
that
comes
to
the
court,
the
court
will
decide
in
that
particular
case,
with
no
guide
at
all,
what
the
reasonable
time
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
know
--
how
do
you
know
when
it's
30
days
after
a
failure
to
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
that
say
anything
about
what
you
just
read
about
what
is
a
reasonable
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
tell
me,
what
is
--
what
is
the
ambiguity?
because
i
looked
at
(b).
(b)
is
limitations.
limitations
is
on
the
state,
and
then
it
uses
the
phrase
of
what
the
state
cannot
do.
the
state
has
to
conform
to
a
reasonable
time.
what
is
ambiguous
about
this?
