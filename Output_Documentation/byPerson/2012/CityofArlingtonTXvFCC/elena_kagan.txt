mr.
goldstein,
at
one
level
you
are
right.
it's
just
a
level
that
doesn't
help
you
very
much.
i
mean,
it's
true
that
always
there
is
an
initial
question
of
whether
an
agency
is
entitled
to
chevron
deference.
but
usually
the
way
we
answer
that
question
is
just
this:
we
say
is
this
the
agency's
organic
statute?
yes.
does
that
organic
statute
provide
the
agency
with
lawmaking
power?
has
the
agency
acted
in
accordance
with
that
--
under
that
lawmaking
power?
well,
then,
the
agency
gets
deference.
we
go
on
to
the
next
thing,
which
is
step
1
and
step
2.
so,
you
know,
what
we
don't
do
is
this
sort
of
provision
by
provision,
subsection
by
subsection,
did
congress
have
a
special
intent
as
to
this
subject
matter
or
that
subject
matter
or
the
other
subject
matter?
we've
just
had
some
very
simple
rules
about
what
gets
you
into
the
box
where
an
agency
is
entitled
to
deference.
justice
elena
kagan
but
take
meade,
mister
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
meade
presented
--
whatever
you
think
of
meade,
it's
a
very
different
question
from
this,
because
what
the
majority
in
meade
said
was
that
the
agency
wasn't
entitled
to
deference
because
it
was
acting
by
way
of
these
opinion
letters
that
weren't
--
that
didn't
have
the
force
of
law.
so
that's
the
threshold
question
is,
does
the
agency
have
power
to
make
rules
with
the
force
of
law
and
is
the
agency
exercising
that
power?
that
is
a
threshold
question
that
has
been
set
by
this
court.
it's
a
very
different
kind
of
question
from
provision
by
provision,
subsection
by
subsection,
did
--
did
congress
think
that
the
agency
had
authority
over
this
particular
subject
matter
or
not.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
goldstein,
i
think
with
respect,
it's
not
silliness.
you
have
been
running
as
fast
as
you
can
away
from
the
arguments
that
imla
has
presented
that
in
every
case
it's
a
who,
what,
where,
you
know,
or
how
question
and
that
we
have
to
answer
that.
but
the
question
that
general
verrilli
raises,
i
think,
is
a
fair
question,
is
how
your
argument
which
says
that
we
have
to
consider
in
each
case
as
to
each
statutory
provision
whether
an
agency
has
interpretive
authority
is
any
different
from
imla's
argument
that
we
have
to
consider
with
--
in
respect
to
every
case
whether
we're
dealing
with
a
when,
what,
who,
where
question
or
a
how
question.
it's
the
same
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
of
course
there's
a
threshold
question,
but
the
threshold
question
has
always
been
is
the
agency
interpreting
its
organic
statute
and
is
--
does
that
statute
give
the
agency
rule-making
authority
and
is
that
what
the
agency
is
exercising.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i'm
still
waiting
for
--
for
the
--
the
way
in
which
your
inquiry
is
different
from
imla's
inquiry.
