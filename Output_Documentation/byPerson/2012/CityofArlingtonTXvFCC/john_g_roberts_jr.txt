chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-1545,
city
of
arlington,
texas
v.
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
your
understanding
of
jurisdiction
and
what
you're
arguing
for
today
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
this
is
a
provision
as
to
which
congress
did
not
give
the
agency
law-making
authority.
you
do
not
defer
to
the
agency
with
respect
to
this
provision
because
it's
outside
its
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
it
gets
deference.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
right.
now,
the
reason
--
the
reason
we
are
hearing
all
about
jurisdiction
and
it's
kind
of
dressed
up--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
simply
because
the
means
by
which
congress
made
clear
it
was
not
giving
the
fcc
authority
to
get
deference,
however
that
is
phrased,
is
this
7(a)
which
speaks
about
nothing
will
limit
the
authority
of
the
states.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
weren't
for
that,
if
it
were
some
other
type
of
provision,
we
wouldn't
call
it
jurisdiction,
but
we
would
just
say
the
fcc
doesn't
get
deference
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
verrilli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
right,
but
your
argument
it
seems
to
me
can't
be
--
let's
say
you
have
a
general
statute
and
you've
got
a
provision
at
the
beginning
that
says
this
is
--
authority
to
interpret
this
is
delegated
to
the
agency.
and
you
go
along,
but
then
all
of
a
sudden
in,
you
know,
section
123
it
says
it
doesn't
get
any
deference
interpreting
this
provision.
now,
you
would
not
say
that
the
first
general
one
controls
the
specific
withdrawal
of
deference,
would
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
you
would
say
you
don't
get
deference
on
123.
and
as
i
understand
the
case,
and
that's
why
i
persist
in
thinking
there's
no
great
disagreement
here,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
is
saying
that,
particularly
given
7(a)
and
some
other
things,
you
should
read
7(b)(2)
as
if
congress
had
said:
agency,
you
don't
get
any
deference
here.
you
can
read
it
that
way,
they
say,
because
7(a)
says
nothing
shall
limit
what
the
state
can
do
other
than
what's
here
in
the
statute.
and
if
you
let
the
fcc,
if
you
give
them
deference,
you're
letting
something
else
limit
what
the
state
can
do.
so
why
--
and
then
you
dispute,
it
seems
to
me,
just
whether
that
you
should
call
that
jurisdiction
or
not,
because
people
think
of
jurisdiction
as
meaning,
oh,
you
don't
get
through
the
door.
but
if
what
they
mean
by
jurisdiction
is
simply
that
the
agency
gets
no
deference
on
this
point,
then
it
seems
to
me
everybody's
saying
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ambiguity
in
the
provision
that
says,
agency,
you
get
no
deference,
or
ambiguity
in
the
substantive
provision
at
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
if
there's
no
ambiguity
on
the
provision
that
says
you
get
no
deference,
then
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there's
ambiguity
on
the
subsidiary
one,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right,
well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
friend
on
the
other
side
has
another
set
of
arguments
about
why
you
should
treat
this
particular
provision
differently,
and
that
is
because
it
concerns
the
authority,
or
lack
thereof,
of
state
and
local
government
agencies.
now,
does
that
play
any
role
at
all
in
your
analysis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
are
not
talk
--
you
know,
obviously
the
dividing
line
between
state
authority
and
federal
authority
is
a
more
significant
one
than
some
of
the
other
questions
as
to
which
agencies
get
deference,
which
is
whether
rates
are
reasonable
or
not
reasonable.
and
this
provision
is
written
in
terms
of
the
preservation
of
state
authority.
and
your
view
would
give
the
federal
agency
deference
under
chevron,
very
considerable
deference,
in
defining
when
there
should
be
federal
authority
and
when
there
should
be
state.
is
that
at
all
a
pertinent
consideration?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
normal
--
i'm
sorry
i
interrupt
you,
but
the
normal
rules
of
statutory
construction
include
a
clear
statement
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
who
has
that
--
who
has
to
be
clear
on
their
statement?
which
way?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
it
intended
to
intrude
upon
state
authority?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it
wasn't
going
to
be
that.
that
--
the
idea
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
federal
judiciary
defining
the
limits
between
state
and
federal
power,
and
having
an
agency
of
unelected
bureaucrats
responsible
to
the
executive
saying
when
the
state
controls
and
when
the
federal
controls,
those
are
vastly
different
propositions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
also
said,
it
also
said
in
(7)(a)
that
those
are
the
only
limits,
not
add
on
to
this
any
limits
that
unelected
bureaucrats
might
decide
to
impose,
and
will
give
them
--
and
the
courts
must
give
them
vast
deference
in
enforcing
those
limits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
at&t
versus--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
in
rejecting
that
argument
in
section
2
of
the
opinion,
the
author
of
that
opinion
in
nowhere,
in
no
place
applied
chevron
deference
in
answering
that
question.
it
was
entirely
de
novo,
unlike
in
section
3
when
it
was
finally
decided,
okay,
we've
got
the
answer
here
and
now
we
will
defer
to
the
agency
on
the
substance
of
the
determination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
cite--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
part
2,
which
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,
ten
pages
of
analysis
of
the
chevron
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
say
they
are
applying
chevron
deference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
talking
about
(7)(b).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
there
about
(7)(a)
that
you
think
is
ambiguous?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
your
argument
there
is
basically
saying
when
the
statute
says
something
is
reasonable,
it
means
that
the
commission
doesn't
have
--
it's
a
jurisdictional
question
whether
it's
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
provision
is
quite
a
bit
different.
it
talks
about
the
authority
of
a
state.
and
usually
when
we
are
talking
about
the
authority
of
which
entity
can
govern,
we
view
that
as
jurisdictional.
there
may
well
be
cases
at
the
margin
that
are
--
that
are
difficult.
but
your
argument
is
basically
reasonable
or
unreasonable
is
the
same
as
state
or
federal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
federalism
values.
i'm
talking
about
your
argument
that,
oh,
once
you
say
you
can
draw
a
jurisdictional
line
here,
people
will
argue
you
can
draw
it
everywhere.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
exactly
right.
that
limits
it.
and
--
and
the
question
then
is
of
course
whether
that's
enforced
in
court
--
enforced
in
court
or
before
the
agency.
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
whether
the
standard
is
defined
in
--
by
direct
judicial
review
or
by
the
agency,
with
deference
to
the
agency.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia

our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1545,
city
of
arlington,
texas
versus
the
federal
communications
commission
and
