mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
start
with
a
central
point
that
i
think
cuts
through
most
of
the
arguments
that
petitioner
has
made
this
morning.
chevron
does
apply
to
a
court's
review
of
an
agency's
determination
of
jurisdiction,
but
only
after
a
court
concludes
that
congress
has
delegated
to
the
agency
generally
the
authority
to
make
rules
carrying
the
force
of
law,
and
that
the
rule
in
question
was
promulgated
in
exercise
of
that
authority.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
in
general.
i
think
that
the
language
this
court
used,
taken
from
mead,
last
term
in
astrue,
in
the
unanimous
opinion
for
the
court
in
mayo
the
term
before,
was
is
the
authority
--
is
the
agency
vested
with
authority
generally
to
make
rules.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
would
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
the
point
here
is
that
to
the
extent,
once
you've
satisfied
that
general
threshold
that
i
identified,
then
to
the
extent
there
is
ambiguity
--
if
the
statute
is
clear
and
in
your
honor's
hypothetical
i'd
submit
the
statute
is
clear
at
that
point
that
the
agency
--
that
the
agency's
authority
has
been
carved
out
with
respect
to
that
particular
provision.
if
it's
clear,
you
don't
get
to
the
question
of
whether
there's
any
deference
due.
the
issue
arises
when
there's
ambiguity.
and
our
position
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--either
one,
because--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
correct.
but
if
there
is
ambiguity
on
the
first,
our
position
is
that
chevron
applies
and
that
the
agency
gets
deference
so
long
as
it's
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute,
and
that's
true
whether
you
call
it
jurisdiction
or
whether
you
call
it
substance.
and
one
reason
for
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
i
don't
think
there
is
--
i
do
think
this
is
really
a
pandora's
box
situation.
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
clear,
neat
dividing
line
between
what
my
friend,
mr.
goldstein,
describes
as
a
jurisdictional
issue,
an
issue
of
interpretive
authority,
and
a
question
of
substance.
and
i
think
you
can
see
that
in
the
briefing
in
this
case.
mr.
goldstein
has
tried
to
define
jurisdiction
in
a
particular
way;
the
imla
has
defined
it
in
a
very
different
way.
they
say
any
question
that
goes
to
the
who,
what,
when
or
where
of
an
agency's
assertion
of
authority
is
a
jurisdictional
question,
as
to
which
agencies
get
no
chevron
deference
in
the
course
of
ambiguity.
and
the
reason
that
imla
gives
for
stating
that
position
is
exactly
the
same
reason
that
mr.
goldstein
gives
for
stating
his
position,
which
is
that
you're
talking
about
an
agency
action
in
excess
of
the
scope
of
its
delegated
authority
and
once
you
say
that,
there's
no
chevron
deference.
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
once
you
have
got
a
situation
in
which
it
is
clear
that
the
agency
has
general
authority
to
implement
and
the
argument
is
whether
its
authority
to
implement
has,
with
respect
to
a
particular
provision,
has
been
carved
out,
at
that
point
chevron
deference
is
appropriate,
and
that
is
the
practice
of
this
court
in
repeated
numbers
of
cases.
american
hospital
association
is
certainly
one
such
case
where
the
--
the
nlrb
had
general
rulemaking
authority,
there
was
a
statutory
provision
that
said
bargaining
units
needed
to
be
determined
by
the
nlrb
in
each
case.
and
the
argument
was
made
that
that
ought
to
be
understood
as
a
carveout
from
the
nlrb's
general
authority
requiring
case-by-case
decisionmaking
with
respect
to
bargaining
units,
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument,
saying
that
--
that
in
that
case,
whatever
ambiguity
there
was
in
the
statute
ought
to
be
resolved
under
chevron
in
favor
of
the
agency.
schor,
cft
v.
schor,
is
a
comparable
case,
and
i
would
submit
iowa
utilities
board
is
a
case--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--our
position
--
let
me
walk
through
the
steps
of
our
position
and
how
we
answer
the
question
presented.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
here's
our
answer
to
the
question
presented,
justice
sotomayor:
that
there
is
de
novo
review
of
the
question
of
whether
congress
has
delegated
authority
to
the
agency
generally
to
act
with
the
force
of
law
and
whether
the
interpretation
claiming
deference
is
an
exercise
of
that
delegated
authority.
once
that
is
satisfied
under
de
novo
review,
chevron
kicks
in.
now,
step
1
of
chevron
is,
of
course,
de
novo
review
using
the
normal
tools
of
statutory
construction
to
answer
the
question
whether
congress
has
spoken
clearly
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
agency
has
authority.
if
the
answer
is
that
congress
has,
then
that
disposes
of
the
case.
if
congress
hasn't,
then
one
moves
to
step
two
of
chevron
and
asks
whether
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
provision
at
issue,
whether
you
call
it
substantive
or
whether
you
call
it
jurisdiction,
is
a
permissible
construction.
is
it
within
the
bounds
of
what
the
language
can
reasonably
accommodate
it?
if
it
is,
the
agency
is
upheld.
that's
the
way
we
think
the
issue
in
this
case
should
be
analyzed.
that's
the
way
we
think
every
issue
should
be
analyzed
under
chevron.
we
think
that's
what
this
case
is
--
this
court's
cases
say.
and
we
think
this
is
what
the
court
uniformly
and
routinely
does
in
analyzing
these
questions.
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--louisiana
public
service
commission,
a
little
bit
of
confusion
i
think
about
that
case.
that
case
was
decided
in
1986.
congress
added
the
sections
mr.
goldstein
referred
to,
251
and
252
of
the
communications
act,
in
1996.
and
what
louisiana
public
service
commission
did
was
define
the
outer
limits
of
the
commission's
authority.
it
said
nothing
shall
be
--
nothing
in
this
act
shall
give
or
--
shall
be
construed
to
give
the
commission
authority
or
jurisdiction
over
intrastate
communications.
so
it
was
an
express
carveout.
that
seems
to
me,
had
you
had
run
that
through
the
chevron
analysis,
it'd
be
a
pretty
straightforward
chevron
step
1
case.
adams
fruit,
the
court
held
specifically
in
adams
fruit
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statutory
provision
at
issue
foreclosed
the
agency's
interpretation.
and
that's
at
494
u.s.
at
page
646.
so
that
was
a
chevron
step
one
case.
it
then
did
go
on
to
say,
with
respect
to
chevron
step
two,
that
even
if
we
were
going
to
think
about
granting
the
agency
deference
here,
they
wouldn't
get
it.
but
i
think
the
reasons
--
if
you
map
the
reasoning
of
adams
fruit
onto
this
case,
it
supports
our
position
and
not
mr.
goldstein's.
what
the
court
said
in
adams
fruit
was
that
the
department
of
labor
did
have
the
authority
to
implement
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
agricultural
workers
protection
act,
including
the
substantive
provisions
governing
motor
vehicle
safety.
what
it
didn't
have
was
the
authority
to
restrict
judicial
remedies
available
for
the
private
cause
of
action
created
under
the
statute.
well,
if
you
map
that
onto
here,
what
the
fcc
has
done
here
with
respect
to
the
reasonable
time
provision
in
332(c)(7)(b)
of
the
statute
was
to
provide
a
rule
of
decision
for
the
substantive
provision
of
the
act,
leaving
to
the
courts
the
decision
of
what
remedy,
if
any,
there
would
be
for
a
violation
of
those
substantive
provisions.
and
so
it's
--
it
totally
maps
onto
--
to
the
fcc's
interpretation
of
the
right
way
to
think
about
statutory
authority
in
this
case.
and
if
i
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
breyer.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
so--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--two
points.
first,
applying
that
approach,
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
one
would
uphold
the
fcc's
judgment
here.
second,
i
understand
that
that's
your
honor's
approach.
i
don't--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
understand
that
your
honor
is
the
most
recent
proponent
of
this
approach.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
--
but
i
think
the
court
is
in
a
different
place,
and
i
think
the
court
is
in
a
different
place
for
a
good
reason,
because
i
think
it's
our
interpretation
of
chevron
that
avoids
turning
it
into
the
complexity
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
because
i
think
if
you
think
about
what
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
proposing
here,
what
they're
suggesting
is
that
once
you've
cleared
that
initial
hurdle
of
deciding
the
agency
has
general
authority
to
implement
the
statute
with
the
force
of
law
and
that
this
is
an
exercise
of
that
general
authority
and,
therefore,
not--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
guess
i
would
beg
to
differ
about
that.
i
think
our
--
our
view
is
that
chevron
does
provide
a
stable
framework
for
the
development
of
administrative
law.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
guess--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--with
respect
to
the
issue
that's
in
front
of
the
court
now,
i
think
--
what
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
asking
is
actually
for
an
additional
layer
of
complexity
in
the
analysis,
even
after
the
general
authority
is
established
to
make
rules
with
the
force
of
law,
and
even
after
it's
established
that
the
rule
at
issue
is
--
has
been
done
in
the
exercise
of
that,
my
friends
on
the
other
side
suggest
that
there
is
another
layer
of
de
novo
review
there
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
this
particular
provision--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--gives
authority
to
act
with
the
force
of
law.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
is
definitely
a
pertinent
consideration,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
let
me
talk
about
that
in
general
and
then
move
to
the
specifics
of
this
case.
in
general
it's
a
pertinent
consideration
that
is
accommodated
within
the
chevron
framework.
at
chevron
step
one,
the
court
applies
the
normal
tools
of
statutory
construction.
the
normal
tools
of
statutory
construction
include
a
clear
statement
rule,
they
include
the
presumption
against
preemption,
and
this
court--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
when
the
question
is
whether
congress
--
let
me
try
to
use
this
with
a
specific
case,
the
solid
waste
of
cook
county
case.
that's
a
case
in
which
the
court
declined
--
it
didn't
say
that
that
issue
there
was
exempt
from
chevron
analysis.
it
applied
the
chevron
framework,
and
it
said
it's
step
one
of
chevron
because
the
migratory
bird
rule
pushed
to
the
very
outer
limits
of
congress's
commerce
clause
authority,
that
the
court
was
going
to
apply
a
clear
statement
rule
in
that
situation
before
assuming
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--congress
has
to
be
clear
in
its--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--to
give
that
authority
to
that
extent,
exactly.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
chevron
step
one
is,
of
course,
applied
by
the
courts,
justice
kennedy,
and
that's
where
the
protection
comes
in,
and
with
respect
to
this
particular--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that
is
the
--
was
going
to
be
my
specific
point
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
but
there
is
a
third
variable
here
and
that's
what's
key,
which
is
in
this
situation,
in
332(c)(7)(b),
the
limitations
provision,
congress
has
spoken
unambiguously
and
said
that
the
following
limitations
on
local
zoning
authority
must
be
respected.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
no
one
has
suggested
that
that
was
at
the
outer
limit
of
congress's
commerce
clause
authority
or
anywhere
closer
to
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
i
do
think
--
i
do
think
that
what
justice
scalia
said
is
correct,
that
the
question
here
is
not
whether
the
states
will
decide.
the
question
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
whether
the
agency
will
be
able
to
exercise
its
usual
authority
to
interpret
reasonable--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--whether
federal
courts
will
make
those
decisions
on
a
case-by-case
basis--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
do
think
--
in
that
respect
i
think
this
case
is
really
just
like
iowa
utilities
board
in
that
the
argument
there--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
in
that
--
the
argument
there
was
that
you
ought
not
to
interpret
the
fcc
to
have
authority
to
implement
particular
rules
because
congress
gave
to
state
public
utility
commissions
the
responsibility
to
carry
out
and
execute
the
rules
and
then
to
federal
courts
the
power
to
review
them
and
cut
the
fcc
out.
and
the
argument
there
was
that
respect
for
states
ought
to
lead
you
to
conclude
not
to
apply
chevron
deference
to
the
agency--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
--
i
understand
that
the
petitioners
made
that
argument,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
read
the
opinion
differently,
and
if
i
could,
i'll
explain
why.
in
section
2
and
looking
at
pages
384
and
385
of
the
opinion.
after
the
court
had
established
that
there
was
general
authority
under
section
201(b)
to
implement
the
provisions
of
the
act,
which
i
do
think
the
court
established
de
novo
and
we
would
agree
that
that's
appropriate,
the
court
then
moved
on
to
consider
these
specific
jurisdictional
questions.
and
the
court
looked
at
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
gave
authority
to
the
state
commissions
and
then
considered
the
argument
that
one
ought
to
infer
from
that,
that
the
fcc's
cut
out
of
the
process,
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
says:
"we
think
this
attributes
to
that
task
a
greater
degree
of
autonomy
than
the
phrase
“
establish
any
rates
”
necessarily
implies.
"
seems
to
me
what
the
court
was
saying
there,
and
then
on
the
next
page
says
something
very
similar
about
the
next
argument
that
the
--
that
the
challengers
were
making
in
that
case.
and
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
does
not.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
does
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
does
not.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
it
does
not.
but
the
conclusion
--
i
think
my
--
my
friend
has
suggested
that
we
weren't
accurate
in
our
discussion
of
the
concluding
paragraph
of
this
phrase.
but
i
would
like
to
turn
the
court's
attention
to
that
because
i
think
we
were.
this
is
at
page
397
of
the
opinion.
okay.
there
is
a
sentence
that
starts:
"the
1996
act
can
be
read
to
grant
most
promiscuous
rights
to
the
fcc
vis
a
vis
the
state
commissions
and
to
competing
carriers
vis
a
vis
the
incumbents,
and
the
commission
has
chosen
in
some
instances
to
read
it
that
way.
"
"but
congress
is
well
aware
that
the
ambiguities
it
chooses
to
produce
in
the
statute
will
be
resolved
by
the
implementing
agency.
"
"we
can
only
enforce
the
clear
limits
that
the
1996
act
contains,
which
in
the
present
case
invalidate
only
rule
319.
"
now,
the
jurisdictional
dispute
was
the
dispute
between
the
fcc
--
the
fcc
vis
a
vis
the
state
commissions
over
who
had
the
authority
to
implement
the
rules.
so
while
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
chevron
is
not
cited
in
that
section
2
of
the
opinion,
the
tenor
of
that
discussion
does
seem
to
me
to
say
that
the
court
was
looking,
once
it
had
established
general
authority,
for
clear
evidence
that
congress
had
intended
to
carve
out
from
that
general
authority
the
particular
provisions
at
issue,
and
because
the
provisions
to
which
the
challengers
pointed
did
not
necessarily
imply
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
carve
it
out,
that
the
court
wasn't
going
to
find
a
carveout.
so
i
do
think
that
really
the
analysis
in
iowa
utilities
board
is
quite
consistent
with
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--yes,
you
had
a
different
view.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
certainly
how
we
understand
the
situation,
justice
breyer,
that
the
agency--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
interpreted
the
meaning
of
the
language
“
reasonable
time
”
to
give
it
more
precise
content,
to
allow
--
to
deal
with
the
failure
to
act
situation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
our
view,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
there
isn't
any
ambiguity,
that
the
rule
ought
to
be
upheld
no
matter
what
standard
of
review
applies,
in
fairness
to
my
friends
on
the
other
side.
but
i
do
think
this
points
up
the
problems
going
down
the
road.
they
are
suggesting
is--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
took
that
--
i
think
that's
it's
--
it's
certainly
susceptible
to
further
elaboration
in
that
sense.
but
i
took
justice
ginsburg
to
be
asking
me
about
the
ambiguity
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
the
(7)(a)--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--right.
and
in
fairness
to
my
friends,
and
as
the
chief
justice
has
just
indicated,
it's
an
inference
from
(7)(a),
and
i
suppose
an
inference
from
(7)(b)(v),
and
that
the
courts
are
in
the
process.
but
i
do
think
this
points
up
the
difficulty
is
that
if
you
--
if
you
look
at
the
provision
that
the
fcc's
actually
implementing
here,
it's
not
a
jurisdictional
provision;
it's
a
normal
substantive
standard.
the
fcc
is
giving
it
more
precise
content.
that's
what
an
agency's
job
is.
it's
doing
its
job
here.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
(7)(b)(ii),
right,
exactly.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
fcc
has
authority,
given
(7)(a),
because
of
the
"except
as
provided
in
this
paragraph.
"
argument.
it's
i
think
our
friends
on
the
other
side
who
say
that
it's
(7)(a)
that
creates
uncertainty
about
whether
the
fcc
has
the
authority
to
implement
the
reasonable
time
provision
in
(7)(b)(ii)
--
and
i
think
that
points
up
the
problem
with
adding
this
additional
step
to
the
analysis.
once
the
court
has
satisfied
itself
that
the
agency
has
general
rulemaking
authority,
it's
not
going
to
be
hard
to
cobble
together
inferences
to
make
arguments
on
de
novo
review
that
the
--
that
the
agency
lacked
the
authority
to
implement
a
particular
provision
with
the
force
of
law.
and
i
think
you're
adding
needless
complexity,
and
i
do
think
--
the
reason
i
suggested
earlier
that
i
think
this
is
a
pandora's
box
is
because
i
do
not
think
there's
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
principled
line
that
can
be
drawn
between
what
my
friend
describes
as
interpretive
authority
questions
and
the
kind
of
who,
what,
when,
where,
substantive
questions,
substantive
jurisdictional
questions
that
respondent
imla
is
focused
on.
in
each
of
those
situations,
the
argument
is
that
the
agency
has
acted
in
excess
of
its
statutory
authority.
and
if
that's
sufficient
to
justify
de
novo
review
in
the
first
instance,
it's
sufficient
to
justify
de
novo
review
in
the
second
instance.
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
i
would
submit
that
you
have
really
unravelled
chevron.
the
good
work
that
that
doctrine
does
to
stabilize
the
development
of
administrative
law
is
gone.
there
will
be
an
argument
in
every
case
that
--
that
de
novo
review
is
required,
and
in
every
case
in
which
a
court
agrees
that
de
novo
review
is
required,
once
the
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
as
a
matter
of
de
novo
review,
then
you
have
ossification
of
the
administrative
process
because
that
interpretation
is
locked
in.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
federalism
values
are
important,
but
i
do
think,
as
the
--
as
the--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
do
--
i
do
think
that's
true,
and
i
think
that
the
arguments
that
are
being
made
by
my
friend
on
the
other
side
demonstrate
that.
but
i
guess
what
i
would
say
in
this
situation
in
particular
is
that
--
we're
really
not
--
the
fact
that
it
does
involve
the
federal
and
state
authorities
doesn't
change
the
analysis,
because
applying
chevron
in
the
normal
way,
one
would
not
conclude
that
congress
has
spoken
clearly
and
restricted
the
agency's
authority,
and
there
is
no
means
--
there's
no
basis
to
apply
a
clear
statement
rule
here
because
congress
clearly
had
the
authority
to
impose
the
limitations
that
it
imposed
in
subsection
(b)
and
those
are
direct
limitations
on
the
state
authority,
and
congress
made
that
judgment.
it
isn't
the
agency
weighing
in
on
its
own
to
decide
that
state
or
local
authorities
should
be
subject
to
limitations.
these
are
judgments
that
congress
made
and
the
agency
is
implementing
them
in
very
much
the
same
way
that
the
court
found
it
was
appropriate
for
the
agency
to
implement
the
preemptive
scope
of
the
word
“
interest
”
in
the
national
bank
act
in
the
smiley
case.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
why--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
agency
has
the
authority
to
flesh
out
the
substantive
standard
that
the
court
will
subsequently
apply--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
agree
with
justice
scalia,
because
--
because
i
do
think
that
no
matter
what
view
of
the
matter
the
court
takes,
the
fcc's
rule
ought
to
be
upheld,
but
i
do
think
that
the
positions
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
advocating
threaten
to
unravel
the
chevron
framework
and
destabilize
administrative
law.
and
i
would
urge
the
court
not
to
do
it.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
you've
analyzed
that
under
step
2
of
chevron,
justice
sotomayor.
you
decided
the
permissible
construction
of
the
statute,
whether
it's
reasonable
or
whether
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
that
would
depend
on
what
the
record
looked
like.
but
certainly,
a
court
would
exercise
review
over
that
matter.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further?
