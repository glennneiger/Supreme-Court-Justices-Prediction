chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-9307,
henderson
v.
united
states.
ms.
gilley.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
--
i
mean,
the
time
from
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case
to
today
is
how
long?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
2
years
--
in
any
case
in
which
--
in
a
typical
case
in
which
this
happens,
you've
got
2
years
of
cases,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
in
johnson
did
they
--
i'm
looking
at
the
two
paragraphs
the
court
spent
on
this
in
johnson.
where
did
they
look
at
the
text?
i
mean,
obviously,
they
quoted
the
text,
but
the
analysis
seems
to
me
to
be
based
solely
on
judicial
efficiency.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i'm
looking
at
where
they
talked
about
this
particular
question,
the
second
prong,
as
they
--
they
put
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
was
the
chief
justice,
by
the
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
matters
to
one
of
us.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
--
it
strikes
me
that
we
are
having
a
very
usual
discussion
in
that
we
are
competing
policy
considerations
that
have
been
raised.
this
is
a
--
a
rule
with
particular
language,
and
i
don't
think
we'd
be
having
this
type
of
a
discussion
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
statute.
i
think
there
would
be
a
different
focus.
obviously,
the
policy
concerns
would
be
raised
but
in
a
different
context.
do
you
have
authority
for
the
proposition
that
we
have
more
flexibility
in
interpreting
the
federal
rules
than
we
would
in
interpreting
the
statute?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
it
highlight
--
it
--
just
to
take
a
moment
--
it
was
highlighted
for
me
in
your
brief
when
you
said,
well,
johnson,
there
was
a
special
circumstance,
so
they
read
this
rule,
then,
this
way.
this
is
not
a
special
circumstance,
so
we
are
going
to
read
the
rule
a
different
way.
is
it
because
these
are
rules
as
opposed
to
statutes?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
in
case
11-9307,
henderson
versus
united
states.
