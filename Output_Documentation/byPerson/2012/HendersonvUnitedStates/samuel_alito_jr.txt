justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
what
you
think
is
the
purpose
of
the
plain-error
rule?
suppose
that
it
was
proposed
to
amend
rule
52(b)
to
take
out
the
word
“
plain
”,
so
that
the
rule
would
read
simply,
"an
error
that
affects
substantial
rights
may
be
considered
even
though
it
was
not
brought
to
the
court's
attention.
"
so
what
does
--
in
your
judgment,
what
does
the
word
“
plain
”
add?
what
--
what
purposes
does
it
serve?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
what
purpose
does
it
serve?
why
should
the
rule
not
be
that
if
--
if
some
--
if
there
was
an
error,
and
it
was
a
really
--
it
was
an
error
that
really
badly
hurt
the
defendant,
then
it
can
be
considered,
even
though
it
wasn't
raised
at
whatever
time
it
had
to
have
been
--
it
wasn't
raised,
there
wasn't
an
objection?
what
purpose
does
that
serve?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
but
i'm
not
asking
why
we
have
--
why
we
permit
plain
errors
to
be
raised.
i'm
asking
why
do
we
require
that
the
error
be
plain
in
order
for
it
to
be
considered?
well,
let
me
suggest
two
purposes
it
serves.
it
follows
from
the
adversary
system,
and
it
serves
judicial
efficiency.
would
you
agree
with
that;
those
are
the
purposes
of
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
does
it
serve
those
purposes
better
as
applied
at
the
time
of
trial
or
at
the
time
of
appeal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
it
serve
--
does
it
serve
judicial
efficiency
better
to
say
that
we
apply
the
plain-error
rule
at
the
time
of
trial
or
at
the
time
of
appeal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
apply
it
at
the
time
of
trial,
it
may
eliminate
the
need
for
an
appellate
court,
under
some
circumstances,
to
get
to
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
there
was
error;
or,
it
could
say,
there
might
have
been
error,
but
it
wasn't
--
it's
not
plain
to
us,
i
suppose.
so
you
have
that
efficiency.
but
if
you
apply
it
at
the
time
of
trial,
you
avoid
retrials.
so
which
is
--
which
of
those
two
is
more
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
serving
judicial
efficiency?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
counsel,
then
let
me
ask
you
this
related
question.
something
happens
at
trial.
there
isn't
an
objection.
and
it
goes
up
on
appeal.
and
the
--
the
appellate
court,
there
is
an
argument
about
whether
it's
a
plain
error
or
not.
and
the
appellate
court
says,
first
of
all,
we
think
it
was
an
error,
but
it's
a
--
it
was
a
close
question.
we
had
trouble
with
this.
so
it
wasn't
plain,
and,
therefore,
this
defendant
is
out
of
luck.
what's
the
justification
for
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
i
mean
in
real
world
terms.
what
--
what
purpose
is
served
by
that?
if
the
court
has
concluded
that
there
was
an
error,
and
it
affected
substantial
rights,
but
it
wasn't
plain,
what
--
what
justification
is
there
for
saying,
that's
too
bad?
you
know,
you
really
got
hurt,
but
it
wasn't
clear
until
--
you
know,
it
wasn't
plain
until
we
decided
this
case,
so
go
back
to
prison.
what's
the
purpose
for
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
why
should
it
have
to
be
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
could
promote
efficiency
at
the
appellate
stage
by
having
a
rule
like
the
rule
that
we
have
in
qualified
immunity
cases,
which
gives
a
court
the
discretion
to
decide
whether
something
was
clear
or
go
to
the
--
to
the
merits
of
the
argument.
you
could
--
that's
--
you
can
serve
efficiency
by
having
that.
but
the
plain-error
rule
doesn't
do
that.
in
the
situation
i
gave
you,
the
court
would
say
there
was
an
error,
it
really
affected
your
substantial
rights,
but
we
can't
say
it
was
plain
to
us
until
we
decided
this
case,
and,
therefore,
you
get
no
relief.
and
--
and
maybe
there's
a
reason
for
that.
i'm
waiting
for
you
to
tell
me
what
the
reason
for
it
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
about
mr.
henderson
sitting
in
prison,
serving
a
sentence
that
we
now
know
was
imposed
for
a
reason
that
is
not
permitted
under
federal
sentencing
law?
is
there
anything
that
can
be
done
for
him?
if
--
if
it
was
very
clear
at
the
time
that
the
statute
prohibited
this,
would
it
have
been
--
was
it,
in
effect,
the
inassistance
of
counsel
for
his
attorney
not
to
have
made
an
objection?
