justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question
for
a
moment
because
i
thought
--
and
justice
scalia.
i
thought,
in
your
brief,
you
--
you
said
that
their
point's
a
good
point.
their
point
is
that
the
system
works
in
a
way
that
requires
the
lawyer
to
object
at
the
trial.
all
right.
and
that
is
an
efficiency
because
the
trial
judge
has
to
--
has
to
correct
--
he
has
to
--
has
an
opportunity
to
correct
mistakes.
he
can't
be
sandbagged.
but,
you
said,
that's
theoretically
always
true,
but,
in
your
case,
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
really
never
true
because
no
lawyer
is
ever
going
to
think,
oh,
i
would
object,
but
i'm
not
going
to
object
because
maybe
the
law
will
become
clarified
by
the
supreme
court,
and
i'll
be
able
to
get
a
plain
error
thing
on
appeal.
the
lawyer
who
thought
that
is
like
the
unicorn,
he
doesn't
really
exist.
okay.
and
you
then
said,
on
the
other
hand,
is
an
efficiency
on
the
other
side.
the
efficiency
on
the
other
side
is
if
you
don't
take
your
rule,
when
you
get
to
the
court
of
appeals,
you're
going
to
have
to
decide
in
real
cases
whether
the
law
was
so
clear
that
the
plain
error
doctrine
still
does
apply
at
the
trial
level
before.
either
it
was
clear
that
the
judge
was
wrong,
or
it
was
clear
the
judge
was
right,
and
there
is
no
point
to
objecting.
so
now
we
have
to
decide,
was
he
clearly
wrong,
was
he
clearly
right,
or
was
it
a
middle
case.
and
when
you
get
to
real
legal
cases
that
have
tough
issues,
you
discover
that
that's
a
hard
question
to
answer
case
by
case,
court
by
court.
now,
didn't
you
say
all
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
well,
then
why
didn't
i
hear
you
say
it
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
can
--
if
you
lose,
you
can't
get
through
the
door.
if
you
win,
you
then
have
to
go
on
to
the
next
part
of
it,
which
says,
did
the
error
affect
the
fairness,
integrity
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
so
if
all
that's
at
stake
is
a
resentencing,
not
much
harm
is
done,
and
you're
more
likely
to
satisfy
the
fourth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
what's
at
stake
is
a
whole
new
trial
and
everything,
it's
probably
a
little
bit
harder
to
satisfy
that
prong.
so
it's
possible
to
build
what
justice
kennedy
was
referring
to
into
the
present
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
--
i
mean,
that's
the
question.
the
word
“
plain
”
of
course
refers
by
and
large
to
an
error
that
the
lower
court
judge
should
have
caught,
so
you
should
have
objected.
but
why
limit
it
exclusively
to
that;
that
is,
you
have
--
you
know,
they
quote
the
schooner,
peggy
and
chief
justice
marshall
and
back
to
the
history
of
hammurabi,
as
far
as
we
know,
that
sometimes
there
is
a
case
where
just
simple
fairness,
plus
the
fact
that
the
law
is
now
plain,
means
that
the
appellate
court
should
treat
this
person
the
same
as
a
thousand
others
who
now
will
be
treated
according
to
the
new
law.
and
indeed,
you're
complicating
it
even
further
for
the
reason
that
i
really
meant
my
question
to
be
aimed
at
you,
you
know.
i
mean,
in
fact,
the
reason
that
i
said
that
you're
going
to
create
distinctions,
there
will
be
a
case,
the
fellow
is
going
to
go
to
jail
for
50
extra
years,
the
law
is
plain
that
he
shouldn't,
that
didn't
come
about
until
the
appeal.
and
here
we
have
six
identical
people
in
the
circuit
where
the
law
was
clear
one
way
and
they
get
the
new
rule's
advantage,
and
six
identical
people
in
another
circuit
where
the
law
was
clear
the
other
way
and
they
get
the
advantage.
but
in
the
one
circuit
where
the
law
wasn't
clear,
he
doesn't
get
the
advantage
of
the
new
rule.
now,
that
seems
pretty
unfair,
and
i
could
at
least
make
up
some
cases
where
it's
just
a
horror.
and
if
that's
so,
why
don't
we
leave
plain
with
enough
wiggle
room
so
that
where
it's
fair,
the
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
can
say,
it
is
now
plain
and
the
other
things
are
satisfied
so
we
apply
it
to
the
defendant.
that's
the
whole
long
question
that
i've
got
every
part
of
it
in
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
whoa,
whoa.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here,
that's
--
it's
the
second
part.
i
mean,
i
think
you'd
have
a
stronger
argument
were
it
not
for
johnson.
but
johnson
is
saying,
look,
if
you're
in
a
circuit
where
the
law
turns
out
to
be
absolutely
clearly
wrong,
then
you
don't
have
to
make
an
objection.
and
then
what
we
do
is
we
consider
whether
the
matter
was
clear
at
the
time
of
appeal.
now,
once
i
see
that,
it's
like
both
bookends.
you
don't
have
to
make
the
objection,
and
the
only
time
you
do
is
when
the
law
is
unclear;
and,
that
being
so,
we're
going
to
have
everybody
doing
research
about
how
clear
the
law
is
one
way
or
the
other,
which
is
going
to
be
tough.
but,
more
importantly,
it
seems
to
me
what's
happening
is
that
52
is
being
also
used
in
part
to
isolate
those
peggy
schooner
type
cases
where
it
is
just
basically
unfair
not
to
apply
new
law.
and
in
the
words
of
justice
marshall,
he
says
that
should
apply,
and
sometimes
it's
unfair
not
to
apply
it
on
the
appeal.
and
--
and
so
i
don't
see
how
you
explain
johnson
on
your
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
the
--
the
--
well,
this
--
i
mean,
the
trouble
is
you've
run
into,
like,
four
different
interpretations
of
what
johnson
really
means.
and
mine,
which
is,
perhaps,
no
better
or
worse
than
the
competing
ones,
is
--
is
you
go
back
to
the
schooner
peggy,
and
you
see
the
chief
justice,
and
he
says,
in
a
case
the
law
has
changed,
the
court
must
decide
according
to
existing
law,
the
appellate
court;
and,
if
it
be
necessary
to
set
aside
a
judgment
rightful
when
rendered,
but
which
cannot
be
affirmed
but
in
violation
of
the
law,
that
judgment
must
be
set
aside.
so
there,
we
seem
to
be,
and
johnson
seemed
to
me
to
bear
this
out;
but,
sometimes
you
do
forgive
the
need
to
object
because
the
overriding
principle
is
the
principle
of
deciding
the
law
as
it
is
at
the
time
of
appeal,
and
to
do
the
contrary
is
just
too
unfair.
now,
that
--
reading
johnson
that
way,
i'd
say,
well,
that
rule
applies
here
too
sometimes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sometimes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
that's
why
you
make
a
balance.
and
the
balance
goes
--
brings
back
the
first
question
that
i
put.
because
in
this
kind
of
a
case
where
the
law
is
unsettled,
we
have
what
we'll
call
the
uniform
or
the
--
problem,
and
that's
the
problem
of
it
doesn't
really
make
that
much
difference
to
the
basic
policy
of
objecting.
and
on
the
other
side,
you
have
the
administrative
potential
mess
of
having
to
figure
out
how
clear
was
the
law
in
the
court
--
the
district
court.
is
it
a
circuit
where
you'd
say
the
law
was
absolutely
--
is
pretty
clear
that
they
were
right?
or
was
it
a
circuit
where
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
law
was
the
opposite,
in
which
case
we
waive
the
need?
or
is
it
actually
mixed
up
and
you
don't
know,
in
that
circuit,
in
which
case
you're
arguing,
don't
waive
the
need.
so
i
see
the
unicorn
on
one
side
versus
an
administrative
problem
on
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
harm
does
it
do,
in
the
interest
of
simplicity,
in
reading
a
word
to
mean
what
it
says?
the
word
is
“
plain
error
”.
it
doesn't
say
whether
they
mean
plain
error
at
the
time
of
trial,
or
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal.
olano
says
it
means
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal.
if
we
say
that's
what
it
means,
then
that's
what
it
means
always.
and
what
harm
will
that
do,
given
the
fact
--
but,
still,
there's
a
plenty
of
a
good
reason,
and
appellate
judges
know
their
job,
not
to
send
things
back,
where
it's
some
technical
matter,
where
he's
trying
to
sandbag
the
judge,
where,
in
fact
--
now
we
have
all
the
rule
4,
the
fourth
prong
consideration.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
words
mean
what
they
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
agree,
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
is
mr.
dreeben's
excellent
argument.
and
then
olano
--
rather,
johnson
says
the
contrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
federal
appeals
court
normally
will
not
consider
a
legal
error
that
has
made
by
a
criminal
trial
court
unless
the
defendant
first
brought
the
error
to
the
trial
court's
attention.
but
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
52(b)
creates
an
exception
or
a
“plain
error.”
it
says
a
federal
appeals
court
may
--
may
consider
a
plain
error
even
though
it
was
not
brought
to
the
trial
court's
attention.
now,
supposed
that
the
time
of
trial,
a
ruling
was
legally
questionable,
but
it
wasn't
plainly
erroneous
and
supposed
forwarded
that
the
defendant's
lawyer
did
not
question
that
ruling,
supposed
that
after
the
trial
but
before
the
appeal,
the
relevant
law
becomes
clarified
perhaps
through
a
decision
of
this
court.
so
that
by
the
time
of
the
appeal,
it
is
clear
that
the
ruling,
as
of
the
time
of
appeal,
was
plainly
erroneous
but
the
error
was
not
plain
at
the
time
of
trial.
does
the
federal
rule
allow
the
appeals
court
to
consider
it?
that
is
the
question
before
us.
do
the
rules'
words
plain
error,
encompass
errors
that
are
not
plain
until
the
time
of
appeal
by
which
time
they
are
not
plain?
now,
the
rules'
language
does
not
tell
us,
but
in
an
earlier
case,
johnson
v.
united
states,
we
held
that
the
rule
did
encompass
errors
that
were
not
plain
until
the
time
of
appeal
when
the
lawyer's
objection
before
the
trial
court
would
have
seen
pointless
because
the
law
at
that
time
seemed
to
be
so
much
indeed
clearly
in
the
trial
court's
favor.
it
would
be
anomalous,
we
think,
to
remit
a
court
of
appeals
to
consider
what
is
now
but
was
not
--
it
was
now
a
plain-error
they
could
consider
it.
everybody
agrees.
when
the
trial
court
was
plainly
wrong,
that's
the
ordinary
case.
and
when
the
trial
court
was
plainly
right,
that's
the
johnson
case,
but
not
consider
it
when
the
law
was
not
clear
at
the
time
of
trial.
that's
the
present
case.
pleading
those
differently
would
be
anomalous.
and
for
this
reason
and
for
other
reasons
set
out
in
our
opinion,
we
find
that
the
words
plain-error
in
the
rule
include
errors
that
are
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal
even
though
they
were
not
plain
before.
our
holding
does
not
mean
that
courts
of
appeals
will
automatically
find
in
the
appellant's
favor
because
there
are
other
hurdles
the
appellant
must
overcome,
including
a
requirement
that
the
error
affects
substantial
rights
and
that
the
error
seriously
affect
the
fairness
integrity
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
in
this
case,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
couldn't
proceed
further.
it
just
could
not
consider
an
error
then
plain
because
it
was
not
plain
at
the
time
of
trial.
we
reversed
that
determination
and
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
enjoined
by
justice
thomas
and
justice
alito.
