justice
sonia
sotomayor
some
circuits
have
even
said
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
second
circuit
says
that
if
it's
a
sentencing
error,
that
the
amount
of
substantial
rights
and
the
integrity
of
fairness
of
the
preceding
question
is
a
different
balance.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
was
justice
breyer
essentially
correct
that
in
most
of
the
cases
where
an
error
is
not
plain
at
the
time
of
trial
that
the
third
and
fourth
prong
of
olano
almost
always
take
care
of
the
issue?
i
mean,
i've
been
looking
for
a
case
in
this
court
in
which
more
substantial
errors
than
the
one
that
occurred
here
--
we
are
going
to
put
aside
the
fact
that
i
don't
see
how
this
defendant
on
the
third
or
fourth
could
ever
win,
given
that
he
was
begging
for
drug
treatment
during
his
sentencing,
so
how
a
resentence
would
affect
the
fairness
or
integrity
of
this
proceeding
is
beyond
my
understanding.
but
isn't
justice
breyer
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
would
say
to
you
that
that's
more
in
keeping
with
the
attitude
that
justice
kennedy
asked
about,
which
is
i
think
most
circuit
courts
believe
the
fourth
prong
is
more
easily
met
in
sentencing
than
in
trial
cases.
whether
they
are
right
about
that,
that's
not
an
issue
we
are
facing
today.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why?
the
very
essence
of
52(b)
is
when
you
don't
make
an
objection.
i
mean,
it's
treating
two
--
it's
addressing
two
different
situations;
a
says
when
you've
made
an
objection,
you
just
have
to
prove
prejudice;
and
b
says
you
have
to
prove
that
substantial
rights
are
affected.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
wall,
why
is
this
whole
test,
as
you're
proposing
it,
dependent
on
the
smartness
or
not
smartness
of
a
particular
circuit
and
the
speed
with
which
a
particular
circuit
reaches
an
issue
or
doesn't?
i
mean,
this
--
basically,
what
you're
saying
is
we
reward
the
circuits
and
the
judges
who
don't
reach
issues,
because
if
the
law
is
unsettled,
then
if
a
substantial
right
is
affected,
that's
so
serious
that
it
affects
the
fairness
and
integrity
of
a
proceeding,
that
is
not
going
to
result
in
a
reversal.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i'm
a
district
court
judge
or
a
circuit
court
judge
or
anyone
else
or
a
circuit
court,
i
would
try
to
avoid
as
many
issues
as
i
could
because
there's
going
to
be
as
little
set
of
reversals
as
possible.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
going
back
to
what
justice
ginsburg
said,
we
take
cases
where
the
split
is
8
to
1,
okay,
or
8
to
0,
because
a
particular
circuit
hasn't
gotten
to
--
to
an
issue.
does
this
mean,
as
justice
breyer
said,
that
the
eight
circuits
who
got
it
right,
the
defendants
have
a
johnson
plain-error
rule,
and
the
one
circuit
who
just
didn't
get
to
it
doesn't?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why
isn't
the
focus
of
the
system
on
the
nature
of
error?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
52(b)
is
about
not
making
the
objection.
that's
--
that's
sort
of
going
around
in
a
circle.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
guess,
i
--
i
continue
to
be
confused
about
what
makes
error
plain
or
clear.
i
don't
know
why
the
pronouncement
of
a
circuit
court
accomplishes
that.
meaning,
so
we
said
in
tapia
that
the
statute
is
perfectly
plain,
perfectly
clear.
and
so
why
shouldn't
it
have
been
clear
to
those
circuits
or
to
that
district
court
judge
at
the
time
of
trial?
you're
equating
the
plainness
of
error
with
what
the
outcome
is
to
--
in
circuit
courts,
and
i'm
having
trouble
with
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
understand
how
you
get
that
from
the
rule.
the
rule
says
any
plain
error
that
affects
substantial
rights,
even
if
it
wasn't
brought
to
the
judge's
attention.
