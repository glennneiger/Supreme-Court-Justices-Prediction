well,
it
would
be
narrow
in
the
sense
that
substantial
rights
would
have
to
be
affected
and
the
other
conditions
of
olano
on
that.
but
i
think,
consequent
on
justice
scalia's
question
is,
that
itself
would
be
another
issue
in
every
case.
is
this
one
of
those
cases:
number
one,
it
was
wrong;
number
two,
it's
new;
number
three,
is
it
clear
under
all
the
olano
criteria.
and
that
would
have
to
be
decided
in
every
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
could
be
a
small
subset
of
cases,
but
the
number
that
would
be
presented,
both
to
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
would
be
quite
substantial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
one
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
is
that,
well,
if
you
require
an
objection,
and
you
have
to
have
a
laundry
list
of
everything
that
might
change,
the
--
the
answer
to
that,
in
turn,
is,
if
--
if
you
use
that
rationale,
then
we're
just
asking
the
attorney
to
conceal
from
the
judge
every
--
everything
that's
important.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
seem
to
me
the
laundry
list,
even
though
that's
perhaps
an
initial
objection
to
justice
scalia's
concern,
is,
frankly,
preferable
to
a
system
where
we
just
don't
--
don't
talk
about
what
might
be
clear
error.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
let
me
ask
you,
i
don't
wish
to
sidetrack
the
discussion
on
the
metaphysics
of
the
plain-error
rule,
because
it's
important
and
it's
the
--
part
of
the
case,
but
in
this
case,
there
wasn't
going
to
be
a
new
trial.
there
wasn't
going
to
be
a
new
jury.
it's
just
the
sentence.
has
any
argument
been
made
that
we
should
have
a
different
rule
for
sentences
than
for
errors
that
would
require
a
new
--
a
complete
new
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
there
any
relief
for
him
in
the
--
in
the
regulations
of
bureau
of
prisons
or
the
government
--
other
than
a
pardon,
i
suppose,
of
defendants?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
eligible
for?
