justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
what
your
--
your
first
answer
was
that
this
is
a
very
small
set
of
cases
that
you're
dealing
with.
if
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
is
yes,
this
court
could
take
a
case
that's
unsettled
and,
by
settling
it,
make
the
error
plain.
that
would
open
the
door
to
a
huge
number
of
cases,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
a
reason
--
i
think
you
represented
your
client
at
the
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
a
reason
why
you
didn't
bring
this
up
when
the
judge
imposed
that
sentence?
i
mean,
there
was
--
one
thing
is
tapia;
but,
before
that,
there
was
a
statute
that
says,
judge,
don't
lengthen
sentences
for
purposes
of
rehabilitation.
and
you
didn't
call
that
statute
to
the
attention
of
the
--
of
the
judge,
did
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
were
you
--
were
you
aware
of
the
statute
at
the
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
months
are
left
for
the
defendant's
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
judge
was
not
aware
of
those
impediments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wall,
why
doesn't
that
describe
this
case?
in
here
is
a
statute,
never
mind
tapia,
the
statute
says
to
the
judge,
don't
lengthen
the
defendant's
sentences
for
purposes
of
some
cure.
and
if
the
judge
was
not
aware
of
that
statute,
he
surely
should
have
been,
the
prosecutor
--
wasn't
it
incumbent
on
the
prosecutor
to
tell
the
judge,
judge,
sorry,
you
can't
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
was
not
aware
of
the
statute.
no
one
called
it
to
his
attention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
why
was
it
a
tapia
claim?
why
wasn't
it
simply,
trial
--
trial
judge,
the
statute
says
imprisonment
is
not
an
appropriate
means
of
promoting
correction
and
rehabilitation?
why
weren't
those
--
why
wasn't
it
really
incumbent
on
the
prosecutor
to
tell
the
judge,
just
read
those
words?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
what
about
what
the
rules
--
what
the
rules
advisory
committee?
i
mean,
is
it
--
when
52(b)
was
put
in
the
statute,
they
--
they
cited
a
case
you
cite
in
your
brief,
the
wiborg
--
or
wiborg
case.
that
wasn't,
at
the
time,
error.
it
was
a
sufficiency-of-the-evidence
error,
the
kind
of
thing
you
would
expect
the
counsel
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
and
nonetheless,
the
--
the
advisory
committee
put
it
in
as
an
example
of
how
52(b)
should
operate.
and
why?
they
said
they
put
it
in
there
because
it
was
a
matter
vital
to
the
defendant.
so
the
objection
wasn't
made,
so
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
was
--
was
not
observed
and
nonetheless,
the
court
said,
we
are
going
to
take
--
we
are
going
to
consider
it
on
appeal
because
the
matter
is
vital
to
the
defendant.
i
can't
imagine
anything
more
vital
than
being
deprived
of
19
to
27
months
of
freedom.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wall,
your
time
is
up,
but
we
have
a
rule
--
the
supreme
court
has
a
rule
--
and
i
would
like
to
know
how
the
government
reads
it.
it's
our
rule
24,
that
says
we,
this
court,
may
consider
plain
error
not
covered
in
the
questions
presented
but
evident
from
the
record.
is
our
rule
--
in
your
view,
must
the
error
be
plain
at
the
trial
court
stage,
or
is
it
enough
that
the
error
was
plain
at
the
court
of
appeals
stage
for
us
to
apply
our
rule?
