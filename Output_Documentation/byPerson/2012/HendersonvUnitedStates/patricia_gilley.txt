ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
primary
points
i
would
like
to
focus
on
this
morning
during
my
argument.
first,
the
question
presented
by
mr.
henderson
involves
a
very
small
subset
of
cases
which
are
--
which
come
before
the
court
under
rule
55
--
52(b)
each
year.
these
are
the
cases
that
were
referred
to
as
the
special
case
in
the
olano
decision.
they
have
errors
which,
at
the
time
of
trial,
were
unsettled
or
unclear;
but,
by
the
time
they
made
it
to
the
appellate
court,
they
had
become
clear
by
a
clarifying
rule
or
a
decision.
second--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
i
believe
that
the
court
would
have
the
authority
to
do
that
because
it
says
if
it
is
on
direct
appeal
or
not
yet
final.
so
it
would
not
yet
be
final
unless
the
time
had
expired
for
the
petitioner
to
get
to
the
supreme
court.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
well,
i
believe
the
supreme
court
has,
under
its
own
special
rules,
the
--
the
ability
to
take
an
argument
in
--
a
petition
that
has
not
been
raised
before,
but
on
its
own
could
accept
it
if
it
is
clear
at
the
time--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
provisions
to
get
to
the
supreme
court
--
frankly,
i
don't
know
the
answer
as
to
if
you
had
skipped
the
--
the
appellate
court,
and
--
and
we're
still
in
that
window
of
time,
that
transition
period
after
the
appellate
court
had
ruled,
and
only
then
the
clarifying
error
came,
i
think
you
could
still
come
to
the
supreme
court.
but
the
very
narrow
--
the
very
narrow--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
your
honor,
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
i
think
there
would
be
very
few
that
would
come
directly
to
the
supreme
court.
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
obviously
would
come
through
the
circuits.
and
what
i
was
referring
to
as
a
very
small
subset
would
be
those
cases
where
there
is
actually
an
unsettled
error
--
an
unsettled
claimed
error
at
the
trial.
there
are
very
few
cases
that
would
come
out
of
the
supreme
court
during
the
period
of
time
of
appeal
that
would
allow
for
the
petitioner
to
--
to
say,
well,
now
it's
clear.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
it's
--
well,
this
case
started
in
2009.
my
client
pled
guilty
in
june
of
2010.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
i
think
that
my
--
this
case,
mr.
henderson's
case,
is
unusually
long.
in
fact,
it
was
a
year
between
the
time
he
was
sentenced
in
june
of
2010
until
june
of
2011,
when
tapia
was
decided.
so
he
was
actually
waiting
between
the
period
of
the
trial
stage
to
--
into
the
fifth
circuit
for
over
a
year
before
tapia
was
even
decided,
and
then
several
months
after
that
before
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
on
the
issue.
so
this
is
an
unusually
long
period
of
time.
i
don't
think
that
that's
common.
i
think
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
do
not
come
within
that
transitional
period.
as
--
as
the
fifth
circuit
noticed
after
mr.
henderson's
case
in
escalante-reyes,
they
sua
sponte
had
their
own
--
they
called
for
an
en
banc
in
escalante-reyes
and
changed
the
position
that
they
had
in
mr.
henderson's
case.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
your
honor,
it
serves
a
very
important
purpose.
and
i
must
say
that
my
understanding
of
that
has
evolved
considerably
since
i
started
researching
this
issue.
i
think
it's
very
important.
and
it
certainly
is
helpful
to
--
to
the
practitioner
because
when
you
come
to
the
appellate
court,
and
you
say,
now,
i
have
a
--
a
decision,
it
is
now
plain,
or
i
have
a
rule,
a
statute,
that
now
makes
this
plain,
it
--
it
is
a
very
important
prong
in
the
olano--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--the
purpose
of
--
of
52(b)
is
--
is
a
safety
belt
for
the
very
extreme
measures
of
rule
51,
which
says
if
you
--
if
you
fail
to
raise
contemporaneously--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--i
absolutely
would.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
the
finding,
the
assessment
of
plain
error;
is
that
the
question
you're--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--i
think
that
it
very
much
helps
to
assess
and
evaluate
the
plainness
of
the
error
at
the
time
of
appeal.
that
--
that
is
where
it
can
really
be
helpful.
and
that,
in
fact,
is
what
the
court
did
in
both
olano
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--i
think
that
it
serves
judicial
efficiency
very
much
better,
as
amicus
very
well
stated
in
his
brief,
the
example
of
the
ninth
circuit,
where,
if
you
don't
have
plain
error,
and
then
the
appellate
court
must
go
back
to
the
trial
level,
the
trial
stage,
and
determine
was
this,
was
this
clear
at
the
time
of
trial?
was
it
clearly
against
the
defendant?
was
it
clearly--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
be
a
correct
assessment.
i
think
that
the
judicial
efficiency
would
be
more
at
the
time
of
appeal
because,
as
many
of
the
circuits
have
noticed,
that's
what
they
are
going
--
they
agree.
i
think
it's,
you
know,
8
to
--
8
to
2
that
they
find--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
multiple
parts
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
i
think
there
--
i
think
that
the
cases
--
the
solicitors,
the
responders
--
respondents
have
conflated
the
idea
of
why
we
have
52(b).
it's
not
primarily
for
the
efficiency
of
the
judicial
system.
it's
to
--
it's
to
correct
a
very
serious
wrong,
an
injustice
that
was
incurred
by
the
defendant.
that's
the
primary
purpose
of
52(b).
and
then,
if
you
look
at
it
the
way
the
court
would
--
the
solicitors
would
have
--
have
the
court
decide
at
time
of
trial,
there
would
be
no
remedy
for--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
we
have
the
rules
going
back
to
the
atkinson
case.
and
the
question
was
what
happens
when
we
have
the
very
serious
rule
51,
if
you
don't
have
contemporaneous
objection,
you're
out
of
luck?
fortunately,
we
have
the
safety
belt
with
52(b).
and
then
this
court,
looking
at
the
--
what
--
what
was
codified
from
atkinson,
has
the
four-prong
test.
first,
we
have
an
error.
it
must
be
clear.
the
--
the
reason
for
having
it
clear,
first
of
all,
it
--
it
creates
efficiency
in
the
--
in
the
appellate
level
court.
the
practitioner
can
now
come
and
say,
my
client
has
a
clear
error.
tapia
has
now
been
decided,
and
it
is
clear.
it
was
only
unclear
and
unsettled
at
the
time
we
were
in
court.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
well--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
i
think
we
must
talk
about
clear
error.
and
--
and
i
think
that
in
my
--
my
briefing,
in
my
--
in
my
beginning
to
the
closing
brief,
and
certainly
in
the
amicus
brief,
which
is
an
excellent
source
on
this
point,
when
the
court
looked
at
both
--
52(b)
in
both
olano
and
johnson,
they
looked
to
the
text,
that
this
court
looked
to
the
text
of
52(b).
and
the
clear
error
that
they
looked
at
was
they
decided
those
cases
on
the
basis
that
the
error
was
clear
at
the
time
of
trial.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
i
think
--
and
--
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
judge
owens'
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
escalante-reyes
in
the
fifth
circuit.
she
addressed
this
quite
well
in
three
pages
of
her
--
of
her
opinion,
where
the
justice
did,
in
a
unanimous
opinion,
state
in
--
let's
see,
i
think
footnote
5--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
i
believe
that
what
justice
rehnquist
looked
to
was
the
text
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
and
--
and
i
noticed
in
my
record
that
i,
in
fact,
had
promoted
justice
clark
in
my
brief,
which
the
errata
shows,
and
so
i'm
--
i'm
not
perfect.
but
the
--
justice
rehnquist
looked
--
and
he
talked
specifically
about
looking
at
--
at
52(b)
and
saying,
"we're
not
going
to
expand
on
it.
"
"we're
not
going
to
cut
it
out
of
new
cloth.
"
"we're
not
going
to
make
new
exceptions.
"
"we
looked
for
it
as
--
as
it
is.
"
and
i
think
that
was
just
a
couple
of
lines
after
acknowledging
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
said,
well,
it
would
have
been
a
laundry
list,
and
that's
inconvenient,
and
it's
futile,
and
it's
a
waste
of
time.
but
that,
i
think,
was
more
of
an
argument
that
went
along
with
what
the
chief
justice
wrote,
that
we're
looking
at
the
text,
and
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
we've
got
olano
that
says,
at
the
very
minimum,
the
error
must
be
clear
at
the
time
of
appeal.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
i
think
that
the
four
prongs
of
olano
are
the
justification.
that's
where
i
would
have
been--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
there
--
there
is
no
purpose
for
that.
and
--
and
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--but
the
appellate
court
has
the
responsibilities
of
applying
the
law
as
it
is
current.
that's
what
the
appellate
court
is
directed
to
do.
that's
what
atkinson
--
that's
what
--
even
what
atkinson
said.
you
apply
the
law
at
--
as
it
is
current.
and
so
what
you're
doing
by
interpreting
time
of
trial
as
a
point
of
determining
the
clarity
of
--
of
the
error,
you
are
completely
eliminating
the
ability
for
the
appellate
court
to
even
rule
on
that
question
because
there
will
never,
ever
be
a
plain
error
if
you
apply
the
time
of
trial
as
the
point
of
determining
whether
it
was
clear
or
not.
people
like
armarcion
henderson
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
--
to
have
plain
error
because
it
would
never
be
clear.
we
have
to
have--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
the
--
the
reason
would
be
similar
to
what
mr.
henderson
faced
in
the
three-judge
panel.
the
--
the
judge
--
the
panel
said
that
the
error
was
--
was
clear,
as
far
as
they
--
they
know
it
happened.
tapia
said
it
happened,
and
--
and
there
was
no
question
about
that;
but,
the
fact
that
it
was
not
clear
at
the
time
of
trial
defeated
mr.
henderson's
ability
to
get
relief.
so
even
though
the
--
the
congress
said,
you
shouldn't
put
these
people
in
jail
for
the
purpose
of
rehabilitation,
it
was
clear
--
everybody
agreed
it
was
wrong,
but
my
client,
instead
of
having
the
recommended
33
to
41
months,
received
a
60-month
sentence.
that's
unjust.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
i
did
not,
your
honor.
and
that
was
a
--
i
knew
that
there
was
--
certainly,
i
was
concerned,
and
i
was
--
that
the
--
the
sentence
was
so
much
beyond
what
the
sentencing
guidelines
had
--
had
recommended.
there
was
--
the
situation
was
i
knew
that
at
that
point
the
guidelines
were
advisory.
i
couldn't
figure
--
at
that
point--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--i
was
not.
in
fact,
i
was
not
aware
of
that
statute.
and
when
i
--
i
did
file
a
rule
35(a)
motion
eight
days
later.
after
i
went
and
did
my
research,
i
realized
there
was
only
one
case
that
i
could
find,
in
re
sealed
out
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
had
addressed
that
particular
statute.
and
so
i
did
file
a
rule
35(a)
motion
timely,
eight
days
after,
and
asked
the
trial
court,
based
on
35(b)(2)(a)
to
please
correct
that
error
in
the
sentencing.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
your
honor,
certainly
petitioner
has
not
made
that;
but,
there
are
so
many
law
review
articles
out
there
right
now
on
ways
of
changing
plain-error
review,
it
might--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--yes.
that
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--that
is
correct.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
and
the
third.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
it
could
--
it
could
be
possible,
and
it
could
be--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--well,
i
think
that
whenever
--
and
i--
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
--it
is
very
substantial.
and
there's
a
recent
case
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit
that
i
was
going
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
judge
gorsuch.
and
his
--
his
comment
was,
"this
is
such
a
serious,
serious
situation
when
we
sentence
a
man
or
a
woman
to
a
time
in
prison
when
congress
says
he
should
not
be
there.
"
"that
is
one
of
the
ultimate
injustices
that
we
should
look
at.
"
and
--
and
i
think
that's
looking
at
it
from
the
--
having
a
separate
--
separate
review
system
for
sentencing
certainly
might
be
helpful.
it
could
certainly
be
more
speedy,
although,
frankly,
in
my
case
it
would
not
have
helped
mr.
henderson
because
it
took
tapia
a
year
after
my
client
was
sentenced
before
tapia
was
decided.
of
course,
i
think
the
argument
could
have
been
made
and
i
certainly
would
have
made
it
at
the
fifth
circuit
if
tapia
had
not
been
decided
by
the
time
we
made
it
to
the
fifth
circuit,
i
would
have
argued
that
it
was
clear
error
regardless.
the
statute
was
very
clear
and
that
it
was,
it
was
certainly
--
when
the
court
eventually
did
look
at
tapia,
they
used
the
straightforward
--
you
used
the
straightforward
language
of
it.
but
i
think
that,
that
the
main,
the
main
point
--
another
point
that
i
did
want
to
make
is
that
by
deciding
that
plainness
should
be
determined
at
the
time
of
appeal,
this
court
would
be
consistent
with
its
holdings
in
olano
and
in
johnson,
because
in
olano,
the
court
said
it
would
be,
in
this
case,
it
is
adequate
that
the
error
is
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal.
in
johnson,
the
court
said
there
was,
in
fact,
no
error
at
the
time
of
trial
but
it
is
clear
at
the
time
of
appeal.
and
so
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
text
of
52(b),
which
is
on
page
1
in
my
brief,
the
text
of
the
brief
is
what
the
court
relied
on
and
the
court,
the
court
said
that
based
on
that
test,
it's
adequate
that
the
court
find
the
appeal
--
find
the
error
plain
at
the
time
of
appeal.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
he
is
scheduled
to
be
released
in
may
of
2013.
he
never
did
get
the,
the
in-depth
treatment
program.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
he
did
not,
and
it's
unlikely
he
would
have
ever
gotten
it
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
a
gun
charge.
he
pled
guilty
to
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm,
which
puts
the
--
the
individual
at
a
very
low
eligibility
for
getting
into
the
program.
the
rdap
program
is
very
highly
coveted
because
if
completed
successfully,
it
reduces
the
time
that
you
are
going
to
be
incarcerated.
ms.
patricia
a.
gilley
the
judge
was
very
well
aware,
and
that
was
part
of
the
problem
that
we
had.
i
was
arguing
at
the
time
of
sentencing
for
mitigating
circumstances
that,
that
my
client
really
hadn't
done
it
and
he
had
possessed
this
gun
for
about
10
minutes.
the
facts
are
not
important
to
this
court,
but
he
had
done
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
this.
he
did,
in
fact,
commit
the
crime
and
he
was
ready
to
take
the
punishment.
the
sentencing
guideline
range
was
33
to
41.
i
did
not
object,
the
government
did
not
object,
and
so
i
assumed
it
would
be
in
that
range.
