but,
mr.
wall,
your
whole
argument
about
judicial
efficiency
is
an
incentives
argument,
and
it
depends
upon
the
notion
that
a
lawyer
is
going
to
change
their
behavior,
a
lawyer
is
going
to
make
an
objection
that
he
otherwise
wouldn't
have
made
if
the
rule
that
ms.
gilley
proposes
is
accepted.
and
this
goes
back
to
what
justice
breyer
said
earlier.
i
don't
know
of
a
lawyer
who
would
say
the
following
to
himself:
i'm
not
going
to
make
this
objection
because
i'm
just
going
to
assume
that
sometime
between
now
and
my
direct
appeal
the
law
is
going
to
change,
and
it's
going
to
change
in
my
favor,
and
when
it
changes,
i'm
going
to
be
able
to
make
this
objection
and
get
over
not
only
prong
two
but
prong
three
and
four
of
the
test,
and
life
will
be
grand
for
my
client.
now,
who
is
going
to
say
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
should
the
government
agree
with
that
really?
should
some
--
can
you
imagine
--
isn't
it
just
as
much
of
a
unicorn
for
an
attorney
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
take
great
care
because
i
think
that
the
law
is
going
to
change
between
now
and
the
appeal,
and
because
i
think
i'm
going
to
win
on
prongs
two
and
three
--
three
and
four.
i
mean,
nobody
can
think
that
those
circumstances
would
arise.
they're
flukes
when
they
arise.
and
so
it
--
it
doesn't
affect
either
the
attorney's
intentional
conduct
or
his
level
of
preparation
and
care.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
the
government
had
a
different
argument
before.
in
johnson,
the
government
called
this
distinction
an
amorphous
one.
and
it
says,
"nothing
in
the
text
of
rule
52(b)
contemplates
or
permits
any
such
distinction.
"
"an
error
is
either
plain,
or
it
is
not.
"
"it
is
more
faithful
to
the
text
of
52(b)
and
simpler
for
the
courts
of
appeals
to
obviate
that
distinction
altogether.
"
said
the
government.
justice
elena
kagan
this
court
did
not
disagree.
this
court
took
a
half
step.
and
the
question
before
us
is
still
the
question
that
was
before
you
when
you
wrote
this
passage,
you
being
the
government,
which
is
should
we
distinguish
between
the
johnson
case
and
this
one.
and
you
very
clearly
stated,
both
as
to
a
matter
of
text
and
to
a
matter
of
what's
simpler
for
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
there
should
be
no
such
distinction.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
wall,
can
--
can
i
ask
you
about
footnote
4
of
your
brief?
this
is
the
footnote
in
which
you
say
that
this
case
involves
only
a
claim
of
sentencing
error,
and
it
doesn't
involve
a
claim
of
actual
innocence
based
on
an
intervening
decision.
is
that
footnote
meant
to
suggest
that
you
think,
or
at
least
that
you
contemplate
the
possibility
that
where
there
is
an
intervening
decision
making
clear
the
conduct
that
a
person
had
been
convicted
of
was
in
fact
not
criminal,
that
you
would
think
a
different
rule
should
apply?
that
the
johnson
rule
should
apply?
justice
elena
kagan
because
then
that
creates
yet
another
complication
in
this
interpretation
of
rule
52.
and
one
might
say,
we
just
want
a
uniform
rule,
that
it
should
all
be
at
one
time,
and
having
said
which
time
it
should
be
at
in
johnson,
and
having
suggested
that
it
should
also
be
in
the
time
of
appeal
for
actual
innocence
claims,
that
it
would
be
strange
to
carve
out
this
single
set
of
cases
involving
intervening
changes
of
the
law,
and
say
those
should
be
at
the
time
of
trial.
justice
elena
kagan
but
--
an
honest
footnote,
an
honest
footnote
in
that
you're
saying
there
is
this
other
category
of
cases
that's
lurking
out
there,
and
that
category
seems
as
though
we
should
have
the
johnson
rule.
justice
elena
kagan
but
now
we
have
two
tails.
but,
you
know,
the
one
tail
is
johnson
and
one
tail
is
actual
innocence,
but
this
is
just
a
tail,
too.
