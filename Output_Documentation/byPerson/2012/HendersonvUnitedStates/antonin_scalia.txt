justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
about
the
time
they
come
up
here?
52(b)
applies
to
every
court,
does
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
suppose
there's
been
--
been
no
objection
to
a
uncertain
question
of
--
on
an
uncertain
question
of
law
until
the
case
gets
here.
can
--
can
counsel
argue
that
this
court
should
nonetheless
review
the
case
because,
if
we
agree
with
counsel,
thereupon,
the
law
would
be
clear?
when
we
issued
our
decision,
the
law
would
be
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
wonder
how
we
would
go
about
deciding
whether
we
would
take
such
a
case
or
not.
we'd
take
all
--
all
those
cases
where
counsel
says,
i
didn't
--
we
didn't
raise
any
of
these
objections,
neither
in
the
court
of
appeals
nor
in
the
district
court;
but,
if
you
agree
--
if
you
agree
with
me,
your
honors,
that
the
law
is
thus
and
so,
once
you
say
that,
that
will
make
the
decisions
below
clear
error,
and,
therefore,
you
should
be
able
to
reverse
it.
makes
sense,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when,
as
is
the
situation
in
this
case,
the
law
is
uncertain
at
the
time
of
trial,
and
there
are
some
circuits
that
have
gone
one
way,
some
circuits
that
have
gone
the
other
way,
surely
it
greatly
serves
efficiency
to
bring
that
situation
to
the
attention
of
the
judge.
he
has
a
50
percent
chance
of
getting
it
right.
and
if
he
gets
it
right,
then
the
case
is
done.
instead,
your
--
your
client
did
not
raise
any
objection,
and
the
judge
just
went
ahead.
now,
if
--
if
the
error
was
plain,
you
can
say,
well,
he
didn't
need
an
objection,
any
--
any
dumb
judge
would
have
--
would
have
known
this.
okay.
so
you
make
that
kind
of
an
exception.
but
i
don't
see
the
reason
for
making
that
exception
where
you
could
have
brought
this
to
the
judge's
attention,
and
he
could
have
solved
the
problem;
or,
if
he
didn't
solve
it,
maybe
the
prosecutor
could
have
by
making
some
alteration
in
what
he
was
demanding
as
a
--
as
a
punishment
or
whatever.
that
--
that
seems
to
me
such
a
--
such
a
clear
efficiency
in
the
system.
i
don't
know
what
the
efficiency
is
when
you
do
it
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
all
you
tell
me
is
that,
well,
it
saves
you
the
trouble
of
going
back
and
figuring
out
what
--
what
the
situation
was
at
the
trial
--
at
the
time
of
trial,
right?
but
you've
got
to
go
back
to
the
time
of
trial
anyway
to
decide
whether
--
whether
substantial
rights
have
been
affected,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
there's
--
this
brings
you
back
to
justice
alito's
question.
there's
always
an
injustice
when
the
district
court
has
gotten
it
wrong.
the
district
court
got
it
wrong,
applied
the
wrong
rule.
justice
has
not
been
served.
but
we
don't
say,
we
want
to
do
justice.
we
say,
we're
only
going
to
do
justice
if
it
was
clear.
now,
why
--
why
would
you
--
why
would
you
have
that
limitation
on
it?
the
only
--
the
only
reason
that
limitation
makes
sense
to
me
is
--
is
because
when
it
is
clear,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
raised
below.
the
judge
ought
to
know
better,
anyway,
and
so
you're
not
sacrificing
any
efficiency.
but
if
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
just
to
do
justice,
i
don't
understand
the
reason
for
the
clear
limitation.
why
should
it
be
only
when
it's
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
okay.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
is
that
so?
why
is
that
so?
why
does
--
does
the
effect
upon
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings
change
when
it's
sentencing
or
when
it's
the
merits?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
--
you're
here
complaining
about
sentencing.
that's
a
substantial
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
--
i
can
also
not
imagine
a
lawyer
who
intentionally
makes
that
decision.
that
--
that
lawyer
is
a
unicorn,
i
suppose.
but
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
lawyers
who
will
not
be
as
careful
about
finding
all
of
the
issues
that
they
should
bring
to
the
court's
attention,
perhaps
be
unaware
of
a
statute
that
they
should
have
been
aware
of.
if
--
if
we
--
if
we
adopt
the
rule
that's
being
urged
by
the
petitioner
here,
it
does
affect
attorney
behavior
for
the
attorney
to
know
that
stuff
that
he
--
he
ought
to
know
but
doesn't
know
will
--
will
not
be
able
to
be
patched
up
on
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
more
than
that,
johnson
stood
on
its
head,
did
it
not,
not
to
decide
the
case
the
easy
way,
which
was
simply
to
say
if
it's
clear
on
appeal,
the
rule
applies.
it
could
have
said
that.
the
case
would
have
been
very
easy.
it
--
it
instead
avoided
that
by
saying,
oh,
well,
this
is
a
very
special
case.
well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
special
case
if
--
if
the
argument
presented
by
the
petitioner
here
were
accepted.
i
don't
--
far
from
--
far
from
appearing
that
johnson
supports
petitioner's
case,
i
think
johnson
tends
to
undermine
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely.
i
mean,
that
--
that
argument
applies
to
whether
the
error
was
plain
or
not.
apply
the
law
as
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
that
was
a
bad
footnote.
i
think
you're,
you
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
joined
johnson,
and
maybe
i
have
to
repudiate
it
if
it
leads
--
leads
to
that
conclusion.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
didn't?
oh,
thank
god.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
sound
like
me.
i
believe
in
the
slippery
slope.
and
we're
proving
that
today,
aren't
we?
