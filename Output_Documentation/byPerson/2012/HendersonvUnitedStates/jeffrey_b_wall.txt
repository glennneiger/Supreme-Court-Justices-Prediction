mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
contemporaneous--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no.
not
in
the
government's
view.
i
think
it's
a
question
for
another
day
how
much
work
the
fourth
prong
is
doing
in
the
lower
courts,
but
i
would
say
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
defendant
is
claiming
that
his
sentence
is
lengthened.
i
think
in
all
of
them
he
will
be
able
to
meet
the
third
prong
to
show
that
his
substantial
rights
were
affected.
it
becomes
a
fourth
prong
question
then.
and
in
the
escalante-reyes
case,
one
of
the
dissenting
opinions
attached
an
appendix
in
which
the
fifth
circuit,
in
181
cases,
had
found
that
fourth
prong
met
and
had
found
plain
error
satisfied.
but
i
would
think
it--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--the
second
circuit
has
adopted
that
rule.
i
don't
know
that
other
courts
have
but
it's
really
--
the
prongs
of
the
plain-error
review
test
are
meant
to
serve
different
purposes.
the
third
and
fourth
prongs
are
looking
at
harm
to
the
defendant
and
to
the
judicial
--
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
proceedings.
the
second
prong
is
really
designed
to
do
something
different.
it's
designed
to
enforce
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement
by
isolating
errors--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--oh,
no
question.
the
purpose
of
that
prong
is
to
isolate
out
one
set
of
errors,
obvious
errors,
from
all
of
the
other
trial
errors
that
happen
every
day
that
are
not
correctable
under
rule
52,
debatable
errors
that
even
reasonably
experienced
district
court
judges
and
prosecutors
might
have
overlooked
in
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
a
trial.
that
second
prong
is
designed
to
say,
“
we
want
”,
as
the
court
said
in
frady,
"obvious
egregious
errors
that
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor
were
derelict
in
countenancing.
"
because
there
we
are
not
as
worried
about
incentivizing
the
defendant
to
make
a
contemporaneous
objection,
because
every
party
in
the
courtroom
should
have
known
and
applied
the
law.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it
cuts
actually
exactly
the
opposite
way.
there
was
a
long-standing
circuit
split
that
the
court
resolved
in
tapia.
courts
have
reached
different
conclusions
on
this.
and
if
the
defendant
here
had
said,
look,
district
court,
you
shouldn't
lengthen
my
sentence
based
on
rehabilitative
purposes.
some
courts
have
found
that
is
impermissible
and
you
should
follow
those
courts,
not
the
courts
that
have
permitted
it,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
sentencing
transcript
is
that
the
district
court
was
genuinely
on
the
fence
here
about
what
to
do
with
this
particular
defendant
and
whether
to
lengthen
his
sentence.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
no.
it
is
then
exactly
the
kind
of
debatable,
open,
unsettled
legal
question
that
our
adversarial
system
counts
on
parties
to
raise
every
day.
and
what
we
do
in
rule
52
is
we
have
a
narrow
safety
valve
for
obvious
errors
that
everyone
in
the
courtroom
should
have
caught.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
that--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--and
i'll
see
if
i
can
get
them
all
in.
so
all
i
can
say
to
you,
justice
breyer,
is
the
same
thing
the
court
has
said
in
puckett,
dominguez,
benitez,
young,
the
rule
52
has
an
interest
in
error
correction,
egregious
error
correction,
no
question.
but
it
is
balanced
against
a
very
important
systemic
interest
in
judicial
efficiency.
and
far
from
being
a
horror,
that's
a
necessary
corollary
of
our
system--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
kagan,
it's
not
just
about
incentives.
even
if
i
granted
that
the
incentives
of
defendants
would
be
entirely
unchanged
no
matter
what
rule
this
court
adopted,
and
i
don't
grant
that
for
all
the
reasons
in
our
brief.
but
even
if
i
thought
that
were
right,
every
time
a
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
issued
an
intervening
decision
of
criminal
law
or
criminal
procedure,
a
set
of
defendants
who
had
not
raised
a
claim
of
that
error
at
trial
would
come
in
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
with
a
claim
of
plain
error.
and
what
we
would
see
is
a
significant
shift
of
judicial
resources
to
plain-error
cases,
to
do
fact-intensive
third
and
fourth
prong
review
to
consider
a
set
of
errors
that
were
never
meant
to
be
put
on
the
table
under
rule
52(b).
that's
not
what
this
safety
valve
was
designed
to
do.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
the
government
agrees
with
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kagan,
i'm
not
here
saying
that
i
think
lawyers
are
sitting
in
--
in
trial
courts
intentionally
going
through
the
kind
of
thought
processes
that
you
describe.
but
i
think
the
effect
that
justice
scalia
is
talking
about
is
real.
i
think,
at
the
margins,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
when
we're
talking
about
these
incentives,
i
do
think
that
in
cases
like
this
one
--
i
mean,
this
is
the
heartland,
where
the
district
court
says,
i'm
going
to
give
you
an
above-guideline
sentence
in
order
for
you
to
take
a
drug
treatment
class.
now,
defendants
all
around
the
country
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
trial
were
raising
tapia
claims.
this
was
not
some
novel
legal
claim
unknown.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
so,
justice
ginsburg,
i
didn't
mean
by
tapia
claim,
depending
on
--
because
this
court
hadn't
issued
tapia.
i
mean
a
claim
like
the
one
in
tapia,
where
defendants
were
saying,
section
3582,
the
statute
to
which
you're
pointing,
does
not
permit
you,
district
court
judge,
to
do
this.
lots
of
defendants
were
making
those
claims.
they
were
percolating
up
through
the
circuits.
even
defendants
in
the
fifth
circuit
were
making
that
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--it's
--
it's
not
about
rewarding
or
faulting
district
courts.
it's
the
way
our
system
works.
where
a
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
issues
a
decision
that
governs
a
district
court,
that's
the
law.
and
the
court
said
in
frady,
we
count
on
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor
to
bring
those
kinds
of
egregious
errors
to
the
court's
attention.
but
where
it's
an
open
question--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
think
the
focus
of
the
system
is
on
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement
in
rule
51,
which
is
what
rule
52
is
designed
to
enforce.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
only
in
the
sense
that
what
rule
52(b)
does
is
it
says
okay,
you
didn't
object.
we
will
let
you
get
a
narrow
form
of
relief,
but
only
in
the
cases
where
your
objection
should
have
been
unnecessary
because
there
was
governing
law
which
everyone
in
the
courtroom
should
have
been
able
to
point
to,
or
where
it
would
have
been
futile--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--because
there's
a
governing
precedent
the
other
way.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think
johnson
--
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
earlier,
the
analysis
in
johnson,
it's
fairly
brief.
the
court
did
not
discuss
the
text,
history
of
the
rule
or
this
court's
previous
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
in
danger
of
running
afoul
of
justice
kagan,
i'm
going
to
agree
again.
that's
exactly
the
government's
argument.
if
johnson
had
resolved
the
broader
question,
it
could
not
have
set
aside
the
--
the
question
here.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
and
this
court
disagreed,
but
studiously
avoided
placing
its
decision
on
the
text--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
kagan,
there
is
no
question
that
in
the
briefs
and
in
argument,
the
government
in
johnson
asked
this
court
not
to
draw
a
futility
exception
to
rule
52
for
cases
in
which
an
objection
would
have
been
pointless
at
trial
in
light
of
governing
precedent,
and
the
court
disagreed
with
us
on
that.
and
the
question
here
is,
is
the
johnson
tail
going
to
wag
the
plain-error
dog?
johnson
rested
on
a
policy
consideration.
they're
just
flatly
inapplicable
here.
this
is
the
heartland
of
cases
in
which
a
contemporaneous
objection
could
have
been
quite
helpful.
this
is
not,
as
the
court
said
in
johnson,
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
being
asked
to
make
an
objection
that
the
district
court
was
powerless
to
grant.
the
district
court
here,
i
think,
was
genuinely
on
the
fence
about
what
to
do,
and
an
objection
could
have
been
quite
helpful.
so
to
take
--
i
mean,
either
the
holding
in
johnson,
which
was
limited
and
could
not
have
been
if
the
court
had
decided
on
a
broader
ground,
or
the
rationale.
even
taking
just
the
rationale,
that
doesn't
apply
here.
i
think
the
only
way
you
could
read
johnson
that
would
help
petitioner
is
to
say
it
resolved
the
broader
question
of
what
the
text
of
the
rule
requires
regardless
of
context.
and
that's
the
one
reading
of
johnson
that's
just
not
persuasive
on
the
face
of
the
opinion.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
breyer--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--there
is
no
question
that
that
concern
animated
this
court's
decision
--
retroactivity
decision
in
griffith,
and
there
is
no
question
that
that
is
one
of
the
concerns
underneath
the
rule.
but
if
it
were
the
only
concern--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--the
rule
wouldn't
say
plain.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--so
i
--
i
want
to
suggest
that
the
administerability
problem
is
very
small
because
it
has
not
been
difficult
for
the
lower
courts
to
apply
this
test.
and
i
want
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
really
significant
cost
on
the
other
side,
which
is
you're
putting
on
the
table
an
entire
set
of
errors
that
rule
52
was
not
designed
to
remedy,
and
you
are
diverting
the
resources
of
the
judicial
system
toward
those
plain-error
cases,
and
you
will
see
a
set
of
such
claims
every
time
a
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
issues
a
decision
of
criminal
law
or
criminal
procedure.
in
just
this
circuit
alone,
it
has
issued
five
opinions
in
the
last
year
considering
just
tapia
plain-error
claims.
and
that's
just
tapia.
and
that's
just
one
circuit.
and
i
think
the
question
is,
what's
the
obvious
prong
designed
to
do?
what's
it
there
for?
and
it's
got
to
be
there
to
catch
something.
and
what
it
is
there
to
screen
out
are
errors
that
were
debatable,
that
even
reasonable
district
court
judges
and
prosecutors
might
have
missed
and
catch
errors
that
everyone
in
the
courtroom
should
have
recognized
because
they
why
egregious
under
the
law
as
it
stood
at
the
time.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
--
not
in
general--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no.
it's
because
we
have
johnson.
i
mean,
i
--
mr.
dreeben
stood
here
in
johnson
and
said,
we've
got
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
rule,
and
you
shouldn't
carve
out
a
futility
exception
to
it.
and
then,
in
our
view,
that
is
what
the
court
did
without
discussing
the
tax.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
i
--
but
wiborg
falls
squarely
within
what
we
all
believe
is
the
core
of
the
rule.
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
at
trial.
that
would
have
been
obvious
to
everyone
in
the
courtroom
that
the
prosecution
hadn't
satisfied
some
element
of
the
offense.
there
is
no
change
in
intervening
law
like
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
and
i
take
your
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
that
we've
got
by
far
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
text.
it's
backed
up
by
the
history.
it's
backed
up
by
this
court's
understanding
in
cases
like
frady,
that
is
designed
to
cure
errors
so
egregious
that
the
trial
court
and
prosecutor
were
derelict
in
countenancing
them,
as
this
court
said
in
frady.
and
i
--
i
don't
see
petitioner
or
the
amicus
really
taking
issue
with
the
government
on
that
text
or
history
or
cases
like
frady.
i
think
they
are
resting
it
on
johnson,
and
for
the
reasons
i
tried
to
explain
to
justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
any
persuasive
reading
of
johnson
gets
them
home.
it
could
not
have
set
aside
this
question
if
it
had
thought
it
was
resolving
what
the
text
of
the
rule
mr.
chief
justice
meant,
or
general--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
think
he
could
certainly
raise
that
claim
in
habeas
and
attempt
to
--
to
get
relief,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
relief
for
him
under
rule
52.
and
i
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
he
--
he
been
a
--
not
specifically
aimed
at
this,
justice
kennedy.
i
will
say
he
has
been
eligible
for
the
rdap
in
the
time
that
he
has
been
in
prison,
and
he
has
never--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--for
the
--
the
--
for
the
residential
drug
abuse
treatment
program
that
the
district
court
wanted
him
to
participate
in.
he
never
applied
to--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
--
not
invariably,
justice
sotomayor.
i
--
it's
possible
to
imagine
a
case
in
which
a
district
court
judge
was
not
foreclosed
from
reaching
some
legal
conclusion
that
nevertheless
no
reasonable
judge
would
reach.
i
just
think
it's
impossible
to
say
that
that's
what
tapia
was.
you
had
courts
that
had
reached
different
conclusions,
and
you
had
a
sentencing
practice
that
had
been
in
existence
for
decades.
now,
this
court
ultimately
found
and
agreed,
the
government
confessed
to
her,
and
the
court
agreed
that
that
was
an
impermissible
sentencing
practice.
but
it
was
still
an
open,
debatable,
legal
question
on
which
courts
have
reached
different
conclusions
for
many,
many
years.
and
i
think
to
say
to
a
district
court
judge
in
a
circuit
that
has
decided
the
question
against
the
defendant,
well,
that's
not
clear
law.
i
think
a
district
court
would
look
at
you
like,
what
are
you
talking
about?
i
have
an
on-point
court
of
appeals
decision
that
tells
me
to
do
x
or
y.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
we
are
leaving
open,
if
the
court
says
that
there
is
an
actual
innocence
exception
in
habeas
to
procedural
default
rules,
that
whatever
it
covers,
acts
that
are
no
longer
criminal,
sentences
beyond
the
statutory
maximum,
that
whatever
that
exception
covers,
we
leave
open
the
possibility
that
you
could
also
get
relief
for
that
under
rule
52.
that
--
that
those
cases
could
--
those
exceptions
could
trap
each
other.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kagan,
i
think
far
stranger
than
letting
the
johnson
tail
wag
the
plain-error
dog
would
be
letting
the--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--now,
i'm
going
to
go
the
other
way.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
but
actual
innocence
isn't
the
tail,
it's
like
the
nub
or
the
tip
of
the
tail.
and
whatever
the
court
decides
to
do
with
actual
innocence,
it
shouldn't
dictate
the
interpretation
of
procedural
rules
more
generally.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
one
tail,
one
nub.
but
the
--
the--
[laughter]
justice
kagan,
this
has
not
been
difficult
to
apply
the
lower
courts
doing
this
have
not
found
it
difficult
to
determine
because
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
frankly,
in
the
real
world,
are
like
this
one.
courts
have
reached
different
conclusions
on
a
legal
question,
and
this
court--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
agree.
and
the
rule--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no.
the
rule
suggests
--
by
far,
the
most
natural
reading,
is
that
the
plain
error
could
have
been
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
the
district
court,
the
one
that
committed
the
egregious
error,
and
neither
petitioner
nor
amicus
has
advanced
any
other
textual
interpretation.
i
mean,
if
we're
deciding
about
that--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--that's
right.
even
--
so
that
that's
the
first
clause.
and
the
second
clause
is,
even
if
not
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
which
suggests
that
that
plain
error,
that
egregious,
obvious
error,
could
have
been
brought
to
the
district
court's
attention;
not
that
it
was
debatable
at
the
time,
and
it
became
clearer
later
because
an
appellate
judge
opined.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
again,
justice
breyer,
johnson
did
nothing,
either
as
a
matter
of
its
holding
or
its
rationale,
to
say
what
the
rule
requires
more
generally
in
cases
like
this
one,
where
a
contemporaneous
objection
could
have
been
quote
helpful
to
the
district
court.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
you
did
not
join
the
relevant
portion
of
johnson.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
it's
fully
open
to
you
to
agree
with
the
government
here.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
don't
think
there's
anything
about
the
text
or
history
or
the
way
that
rule
has
been
used
that
suggests
it
should
be
interpreted
differently
from
rule
52.
