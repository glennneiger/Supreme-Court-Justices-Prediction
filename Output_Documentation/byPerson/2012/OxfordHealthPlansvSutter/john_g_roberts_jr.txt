chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-135,
oxford
health
plans
v.
florida.
mr.
waxman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
it's
not
exactly
--
this
is
not
the
only
clause
that
provides
for
arbitration.
it
is
not
the
standard
boilerplate
so
you
could
say
when
he
interprets
it,
he's
really
making
a
decision
about
arbitrability.
and
you
can
follow
--
i
mean,
you
may
disagree
with
it,
i
may
disagree
with
it
--
but
you
understand
the
reasoning.
it
says,
no
civil
action
be
brought,
all
such
disputes
will
go
to
arbitration,
this
is
a
class
action,
this
is
a
civil
action,
so
it
must
go
to
arbitration,
and
therefore,
it's
there.
now,
you
--
you
may
not
agree
with
it,
but
it
--
it
at
least
purports
to
be
an
interpretation
of
the
language
rather
than
a
general
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katz?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
inconsistent
with
the
law
that's
developed
--
actually
in
fairness
to
the
arbitrator,
after
he'd
made
his
initial
decision,
which
is
that
if
you
have
something
that
just
says
disputes
and
doesn't
address
the
issue
of
class
arbitration
at
all,
that
you
can't
have
class
arbitration.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
get
back
--
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
getting
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
i
thought
his
--
first
options
is
fairly
strong
authority
for
him,
because
there
you
have
a
situation
with
the
arbitrator
determining
that
a
particular
entity
or
individual
is
bound
by
the
agreement.
and
we
said
that's
something
that
we
will
review
de
novo
without
deference.
why
isn't
it
the
same
here?
in
other
words,
not
everything
an
arbitrator
says
is
subject
to
the
deferential
standard
of
review,
even
if
he
purports
to
say
i'm
interpreting
the
agreement,
which
i
think
the
arbitrator
in
first
options
did?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
difference
is
in
first
options.
the
one
thing
first
options
says
is
the
question
of
who's
going
to
be
bound
by
arbitration
is
decided
by
the
court
de
novo.
and
in
the
class
context,
you
are
binding
19,999
individuals
who
did
not
agree
to
be
bound,
depending
upon
the
particular
interpretation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
this
may
not
--
i'm
not
sure
it's
relevant,
but
it
--
it
might
be.
i
thought
the
purpose
of
arbitration
was
to
decide
these
things
quickly.
this
has
been
going
on
11
years,
right?
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
facetious
question,
because
i
think
one
of
the
concerns
about
class
arbitration
is
that
it
--
it
eliminates
the
supposed
benefits
of
arbitration,
because
you
can't
have
sort
of
quick
and
rough
and
ready
determinations
when
it's
going
to
bind
20,000
people.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
surely--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
under
--
under
--
that
provision,
the
partiality
provision,
is
addressed
to
favoring
one
party
as
opposed
to
another
party.
i
think
justice
kennedy's
question
goes
to
an
institutional
concern
about
an
arbitrator
making
a
decision
of
this
sort
that
goes,
not
to
partiality
between
parties,
but
a
problem
about
the
way
the
system
would
work,
that
would
create
an
incentive
for
an
arbitrator,
implicit
or
explicit,
to
reach
a
ruling
that
expands
his
authority.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry
to
just
interrupt.
for
most
of
that
two
centuries,
courts
refused
to
enforce
arbitration
agreements.
that's
the
whole
reason
we
have
the
faa.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
katz.
mr.
waxman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice

g.
roberts,
jr.

you,

waxman.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-135,
oxford
health
plans
versus
sutter.
