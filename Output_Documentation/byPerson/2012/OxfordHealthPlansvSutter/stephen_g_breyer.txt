justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
comes
under
our
basic
thing
--
as
i
read
this,
the
difference
was
between
this
and
stolt-nielsen,
you
have
two
parties
here
and
they
both
say,
arbitrator,
you
decide
whether
or
not
this
language,
that
says
nothing
about
it,
did
encompass
class
or
not.
in
stolt-nielsen
the
claimant,
who
wanted
arbitration,
agreed
that
the
clause
said
nothing
about
it.
so,
given
his
concession
there,
the
only
way
it
could
have
gotten
in
is
if
the
arbitrator
was
doing
some
policy
thing.
given
the
lack
of
any
similar
concession
here,
the
way
that
the
arbitrator
got
it
in
is
he
read
this
ambiguous
language,
looked
at
the
situation,
and
said,
hmm,
guess
it's
in.
now,
in
the
latter
case,
we
should
presume
everything
from
the
arbitrator's
favor;
former
case,
no,
they've
admitted
that
it
wasn't
in
the
clause.
okay.
so,
that
--
now,
what's
the
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
thought
it
said
that
--
that
the
award
--
if
the
award
displays
manifest
disregard,
or
words
like
that.
i
mean,
misco
is
--
is
not
absolute.
misco
has
a
narrow
exception,
and
that
exception
is
where
there's
just
no
basis
in
the
contract
for
the
decision.
and
so
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
here
that's
clearly
not
so,
there
is
a
basis.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
different
thing,
that's
a
different
thing.
it
doesn't
say
whatever
he
says
about
the
contract,
he
wins.
it
says
what
he
says
about
the
contract,
it
is
not
just
manifestly
wrong,
it
isn't
just
plain
language
to
the
contrary,
and
et
cetera.
there
is
language
in
the
cases
to
that
effect.
so
i
would
be
repeating
myself,
but
are
you
saying
there
is
no
loophole
no
matter
how
tiny?
that's
news
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
i
think,
since
i
wrote
the
words
in
first
options,
that
something
like
manifest
disregard
or
totally
ignoring
plain
law
is
a
ground
for
reversing
an
arbitrator,
even
an
arbitrator.
now,
suppose
i
think
that.
then
do
i
decide
against
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
look,
i'm
going
to
say
something
and
you
are
going
to
say,
that's
right,
that's
just
what
i
wanted,
and
that
won't
do
me
any
good
if
you
don't
think
of
it.
the
arbitrator
in
front
of
me,
so
you
better
tell
me
why
i'm
wrong,
because
they
certainly
will
and
they
are
in
the
briefs.
mr.
arbitrator,
this
class
--
this
language
here
says
all
disputes
will
go
to
arbitration.
it
doesn't
say
they
are
supposed
to
be
class
or
can
be
or
can't
be.
you
decide
what
it
means.
and
the
arbitrator
thinks,
hmm,
all,
hmm,
it
doesn't
say,
but
i
got
to
reach
a
decision.
so
what
kind
of
a
case
is
it?
small
claims.
and
then
it
says
something
about
court
suits
where
they
have
class.
hmm,
gets
his
magic
8-ball
out
and,
whatever
it
is,
he
says,
that's
what
it
means.
it
means
it
could
include
class,
too.
okay?
where
in
our
case
law
is
that
a
manifest
disregard?
he's
looked
at
the
language,
there
were
two
plausible
constructions,
he
came
up
with
one
of
them.
what's
the
problem?
now,
that's
of
course
their
problem,
but
if
you
just
say
yes
and
don't
go
into
why
they
are
saying
no
it's
not
going
to
help
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
--
obviously
you
don't.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
use
whatever
word
you
want.
manifest
disregard,
stick
to
the
law.
now,
suppose
the
arbitrator
had
said
this:
it
doesn't
say
how
to
do
it;
i
see
how
you
do
it;
you
get
out
a
magic
8-ball.
now,
we
would
strike
that
down,
because
that
is
not
relevant.
but
he
didn't
say
magic
8-ball.
he
said
class.
and
there
are
many
class
arbitrations.
so
it
isn't
quite
magic
8-ball.
now,
you
explain
to
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--a
magic
8-ball
is
you
have
--
that's
a
little
thing,
it's
the
--
it's
a
non-sportsman's
equivalent
of
throwing
darts.
[laughter]
