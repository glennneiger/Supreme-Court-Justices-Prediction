mr.
waxman,
can
i
just
ask
you
what
you
think
the
standard
is
under
10(a)(4),
because
my
understanding
of
the
standard
was
that
a
court
had
to
find
that
an
arbitrator
was
exceeding
his
powers,
was
acting
outside
the
scope
of
his
authority--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
that
we
have
said
quite
a
number
of
times
that
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
committed
an
error
and
even
a
serious
error
is
not
enough,
that
he
had
to
be
doing
something
that
was
simply
outside
the
scope
of
his
authority.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
disagree
with
that?
and
if
you
disagree
with
that,
what's
your
standard
for
what
we
should
be
thinking
about
in
--
under
10(a)(4).
justice
elena
kagan
and
you
don't
disagree,
do
you,
that
this
arbitrator
--
if
you
read
his
opinion,
you
might
think
it's
terribly
wrong,
but
that
what
he's
doing
is
trying
to
construe
a
contract.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
he
is
going
--
but
he's
looking
at
the
words,
that
he's
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
parties
agreed
on
when
there's
no
explicit
statement
about
what
the
parties
agreed
on.
justice
elena
kagan
so
now
you're
saying
that
he
exceeded
his
authority
because
he
didn't
apply
a
kind
of
clear
statement
presumption.
but
i
don't
think
that
we've
ever
suggested
that
there
is
such
a
clear
statement
presumption.
in
stolt-nielsen,
we
said
that
if
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
they
haven't
agreed
on
anything,
then
we're
not
going
to
accept
class
arbitration.
but
we've
not
said
that
in
the
process
of
construing
an
agreement
there
is
a
clear
statement
rule.
now,
maybe
we
should
have
said
that,
but,
you
know,
it's
--
it's
no
place
in
our
case
law
now.
justice

this
is
a
case
about
the
finality
of
arbitration
decisions.
john
sutter,
the
respondent
here,
is
a
pediatrician
who
had
a
fee
for
services
contract
with
petitioner
oxford
health
plans,
a
health
insurance
company.
sutter
sued
oxford
in
new
jersey
court
on
behalf
of
the
proposed
class
of
new
jersey
physicians,
alleging
that
oxford
had
violated
its
agreements
by
failing
to
make
full
and
prompt
payment
for
the
doctor's
services.
citing
the
contracts
arbitration
clause,
oxford
successfully
moved
to
compel
arbitration
of
sutter's
claims.
oxford
and
sutter
then
agreed
that
the
arbitrator
should
decide
whether
their
contract
authorized
class
arbitration.
after
analyzing
the
text
of
their
arbitration
agreement,
the
arbitrator
concluded
that
it
did
and
the
case
proceeded
on
a
classwide
basis.
a
few
years
later,
we
hold
in
a
case
called
stolt-nielsen
that
an
arbitrator
may
employ
class
procedures
only
if
the
parties
have
affirmatively
authorized
them.
oxford
immediately
asked
the
arbitrator
to
reconsider
his
decision
in
light
of
stolt-nielsen,
but
the
arbitrator
issued
a
new
opinion
explaining
again
that
he
read
the
parties'
agreement
to
authorize
class
arbitration
and
therefore,
that
stolt-nielsen
had
no
impact
on
the
case.
oxford
filed
this
suit
in
federal
court
arguing
that
the
arbitrator
had
exceeded
his
powers
which
under
section
10(a)(4)
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
a
ground
to
vacate
an
arbitrator's
decision.
the
district
court
rejected
oxford's
argument
in
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
today,
we
affirm
the
third
circuit.
courts
can
vacate
arbitral
awards
only
in
very
unusual
circumstances.
here,
as
i
just
said,
oxford
relies
on
section
10(a)(4)
which
authorizes
a
court
to
set
aside
an
arbitrator's
decision
when
the
--
when
the
arbitrator
exceeded
his
powers.
we
have
long
held
that
an
arbitrator
does
not
exceed
his
powers
by
making
an
error,
even
a
large
one.
that's
because
when
the
parties
agree
to
have
an
arbitrator
resolve
a
dispute,
theyv
bargained
for
the
arbitrator's
answer
and
they
have
to
live
with
it.
an
arbitrator's
decision
that
is
even
arguably
construing
or
applying
the
contract
cannot
be
vacated.
it's
only
when
an
arbitrator
clearly
goes
beyond
the
scope
of
his
delegated
authority
when
he
imposes
his
own
policy
preferences
rather
than
looking
to
the
contract
that
a
court
may
overturn
his
decision.
in
short,
the
only
question
for
us
is
whether
the
arbitrator
arguably
interpreted
the
contract,
not
whether
he
got
its
meaning
right
or
wrong.
as
our
opinion
explains,
the
arbitrator's
decisions
here
were
through
and
through,
interpretations
of
the
parties'
agreement.
in
both,
he
answered
the
question
the
parties
submitted
to
him
whether
their
agreement
allowed
class
arbitration.
he
did
so
by
interpreting
the
text
of
their
arbitration
clause.
whether
his
interpretation
was
right
or
wrong
makes
no
difference.
because
the
arbitrator
was
interpreting
the
contract,
he
did
not
exceed
his
powers.
it
is
just
that
simple.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
