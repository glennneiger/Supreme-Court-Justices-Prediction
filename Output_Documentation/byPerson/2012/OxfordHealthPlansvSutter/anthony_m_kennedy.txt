justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
rule
is
that
although
we
must
defer
to
an
arbitrator's
interpretation
of
the
contract,
in
this
case,
there
is
an
exception
because?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
we
make
that
rule
just
with
reference
to
the
word
“
arbitration
”
when
it's
in
the
class
action
context,
or
does
this
apply
to
other
words
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
just
not
sure
what
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
--
could
they
opt
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
how
could
--
how
could
they
opt
out
if
the
arbitrator
said
--
says,
as
justice
scalia
and
justice
alito
are
suggesting,
we
have
--
i
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
case.
i
decide
that
there
is
a
class
action,
all
these
people
are
in
the
class?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
--
ask
you
this
question,
because
i
think
it's
consistent
to
the
answer
you're
giving
to
the
chief
justice,
a
little
bit
different,
though.
suppose
you
have
--
and
this
is
a
hypothetical
case;
this
is
not
this
case
because
i
don't
know
the
facts.
suppose
you
have
an
attorney
in
a
small
town,
well
respected,
doesn't
have
a
great
big
practice,
and
he's
chosen
as
the
arbitrator.
and
if
he
arbitrates
the
one
case,
he's
going
to
get
a
fee
of,
i
don't
know,
$10,000.
he
says,
you
know,
if
this
is
a
class
arbitration,
i
can
keep
this
going
for
11
years,
i
will
make
a
million
dollars.
does
he
have
the
obligation
to
say,
i'm
going
to
decide
the
class
action
issue
under
this
theory
that
is
decided
here,
and
after
i
do
that,
since
i
have
a
conflict,
i'll
bow
out.
i'll
just
say,
there
is
a
class
action,
and
then
i
will
leave
it
for
some
other
arbitrator.
does
he
have
that
obligation?
and
if
he
doesn't,
should
that
bear
on
our
decision
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
tell
me
why
--
why
is
that
a
factor
or
not
a
factor
in
--
in
our
decision?
that
should
not
be
a
factor
in
our
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
significant
point?
[laughter]
