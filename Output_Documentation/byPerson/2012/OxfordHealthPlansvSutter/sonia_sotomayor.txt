mr.
waxman--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
my
question.
did
you
never
--
you
never
argued
that
it
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
arbitrator
to
decide
this
question,
did
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
--
always
an
arbitrator's
question
when
all
disputes
are
supposed
to
be
submitted,
or
was
just
--
was
there
just
a
mistake
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
should
we
rewrite
our
standard
of
review
to
accommodate
your
client's
error?
because
that's
really
what
you're
asking
us
to
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
more
than
once
we
have
said
an
error
of
law
or
fact
is
not
a
basis
to
say
that
an
arbitrator
exceeded
his
or
her
powers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
waxman,
how
wrong
does
an
arbitrator's
decision
have
to
be
to
become
an
issue
of
law?
meaning
--
because
that's
the
rule
you're
proposing.
i
used
to
think
that
exceeding
your
powers
was
deciding
an
issue
the
parties
hadn't
agreed
to
arbitrate,
but
here
you've
conceded
that
you
gave
the
issue
to
the
arbitrator.
so
he
hasn't
exceeded
his
power
to
construe
the
contract
with
respect
to
this
dispute;
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
what
instead
you're
saying
is
that
“
exceeded
your
powers
”
means
that
an
error
the
arbitrator
makes
has
to
be
of
what
quality?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
i
see--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel
--
counsel,
you
seem
--
i
don't
know.
i
see
two
questions
here.
the
first
was
an
arbitrator
exceeds
his
power
if
he
decides
a
question
is
arbitral
when
it's
not.
and
--
but
here
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
because
you
are
right,
your
adversary
submitted
this
question
to
arbitration.
and
that's
what
i'm
hearing
you
respond.
he
did,
there's
no
question,
he
said
the
arbitrator
has
to
decide
this
issue.
justice
breyer
raised
the
second
question:
assuming
he
could,
is
there
any
remaining
power
in
the
court
to
overturn
his
decision?
and
justice
breyer
said,
if
the
standard
is
manifest
disregard
of
fact
and
law,
why
would
you
still
win?
because
your
adversary
is
saying:
the
law
is
clear
you
have
to
find
some
hook
in
the
agreement
to
agree
to
class
action
--
arbitration.
and
he
says
there
is
none.
that's
basically
his
position,
that
the
arbitrator's
decision
on
its
substance
manifestly
disregarded
the
law.
so
that's
the
question
that
i
believe
is
extant
still.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
was
it
a
hypothetical?
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
want
to
say
why
there
wasn't.
i
want
you
to
explain
why
there
wasn't
one.
