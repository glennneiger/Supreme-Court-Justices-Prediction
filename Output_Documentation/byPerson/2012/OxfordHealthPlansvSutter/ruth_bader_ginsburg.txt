but
--
about
the
parties
never
considering
it,
when
this
case
was
in
the
new
jersey
courts,
oxford
explained
--
this
is
in
the
red
brief
at
page
27
that's
quoting
oxford's
counsel
then,
that
"the
arbitrator
has
the
power
to
ascertain
whether
the
parties
contemplated
class
arbitration
in
their
agreements.
"
a
power
in
the
arbitrator
that
oxford
does
not
contest.
does
it
--
that
seems
to
be
a
recognition
by
oxford
that
--
that
class
arbitration
was
contemplated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
--
in
stolt-nielsen,
the
parties
stipulated
that
the
contract
said
nothing
on
the
issue
of
class
proceeding.
in
this
case,
we
have
no
such
stipulations--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
arbitrator
is
interpreting
a
term
of
the
contract,
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
--
that
the
arbitration
--
arbitrator's
interpretation
of
a
contract
term,
wrong
or
right,
unless
it's
off
the
wall,
is
--
is
not
to
be
overturned.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
a
combination
of
the
two
provisions.
he
said
that
everything
that
is
excluded
by
the
first
provision
is
included
in
the
second.
and
he
also
said
something,
which
may
or
may
not
be
so.
he
said
that
this
particular
way
of
describing
the
--
the
--
what's
arbitrable,
this
is
an
unusual
wording.
we
have
--
there's
no
civil
action
in
the
first
clause
and
then
arbitration
in
the
second.
he
said
that
he
had
never
seen
this
particular
language.
is
he
wrong
in
--
in
saying
that
this
language
is
unusual?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
this
--
was
this
a
--
well,
was
this
an
experienced
arbitrator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
of
course,
this
was
--
this
was
an
adhesion
contract,
so
there's
no
--
it
was
drafted
by
oxford.
and
you
made
a
point
about
betting
the
house,
that
the
company
wouldn't
have
agreed
to
it.
but
on
the
side
of
the
doctor,
he
has
a
$10,000
--
a
$1,000
claim,
and
he
is
saying
that
without
a
class
proceeding,
there
is
--
there
is
essentially
no
means
to
enforce
the
contract
against
oxford,
that
none
of
these
parties,
none
of
the,
what
was
it,
13,000
doctors,
none
of
them
could
enforce
the
contract
because
the
expense
would
be
much
greater
than
the
$1,000
they
could
get
at
the
end.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
oxford
conceded
that
it
did
not
preserve
any
question
of
entitlement
to
de
novo
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
don't
you,
mr.
katz,
why
don't
you
concentrate
on
what
the
arbitrator
himself
said.
mr.
waxman
said
this
clause
wasn't
unusual
but
the
arbitrator
said,
i've
never
seen
anything
like
this.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
--
is
the
contract
authorized
it
as
for
dr.
sutter,
all
of
the
others
are
similarly
situated,
they
got
the
same
contracts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
either
the
contract
means
what
the
arbitrator
said
it
meant
or
it
doesn't.
if
it
means
what
the
arbitrator
said
it
meant,
then
everybody's
bound.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
those
--
and
there
are
rules
that
governed
that,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
never
have
class
action
arbitration
if
that
were
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
would
be
impossible,
because
you
could
never
get
in
advance
--
they
find
out
that
by
getting
notice
and
then
they
decide
whether
they
want
to
stay
with
it
or
opt
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
long
--
can
we
straighten
out
this
11
years?
how
many
years
was
this
in
the
new
jersey
court
before
there
was
ever
an
arbitrator
appointed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
--
how
--
what
is
the
history
of
class
actions
and
arbitrations?
there
are
at
least
enough
of
them
so
that
the
aaa
has
a
set
of
rules
about
how
you
handle
class
arbitrations,
right?
