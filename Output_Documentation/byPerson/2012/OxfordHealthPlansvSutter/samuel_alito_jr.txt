out
of
curiosity,
mr.
waxman,
in
a
case
like
this,
how
is
the
arbitrator
paid?
is
the
arbitrator
paid
by
the
hour
or
a
flat
fee?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
a
question
on
something
a
little
bit
different?
did
the
arbitrator
have
--
how
many
parties
were
there
to
this
agreement?
there
is
oxford
on
one
side
and
how
many
doctors
on
the
other
side?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
so
20,000.
and
the
effect
of
the
arbitrator's
decision
is
that
all
of
those
20,000
doctors
are
deemed
to
have
agreed
to
class
arbitration,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
we
assume
--
if
i
ask
you
to
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
agreement
does
not
constitute
an
agreement
to
engage
in
class
arbitration,
where
did
the
arbitrator
get
the
authority
to
make
that
holding
with
respect
to
all
of
these
absent
class
members?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
they
didn't
agree
to
class
arbitration,
how
can
they
--
and
they
didn't
agree
to
have
the
arbitrator
decide
whether
the
agreement
calls
for
--
for
class
arbitration.
how
did
he
purport
to
bind
them
to
that
decision?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wait
a
minute.
where
did
he
get
the
authority
to
make
that
decision
to
interpret
the
contract
with
respect
to
them?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you're
saying
he
can
do
it
with
respect
to
oxford
because
oxford
agreed
to
have
the
arbitrator
decide
whether
this
calls
for
class
arbitration.
but
these
other
people
didn't.
they
didn't
agree
to
have
the
arbitrator
decide
whether
it
calls
for
class
arbitration.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
presumably
they
could
opt
out,
but
did
they
agree
to
be
bound
by
this
unless
they
opted
out?
that's
not
the
usual
way
people
are
bound
by
litigations.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
you're
--
you're
not
--
you're
not
accepting
my
assumption
that
this
is
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
contract.
that's
the
assumption.
this
is
incorrect.
if
we
were
reviewing
this
as
an
appellate
court
reviewing
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
under
stolt-nielsen,
we
would
say,
this
is
wrong.
this
is
really
wrong.
okay?
assume
that
to
be
the
case.
then
how
are
they
--
how
are
these
absent
people
bound?
and
it's
really
not
an
answer
to
say,
well,
they
can
opt
out.
if
they
didn't
agree
to
be
bound
by
this
arbitrator's
decision,
then
they
didn't
agree
to
be
bound
absent
by
opting
out,
which
is
an
unusual
procedure
for
being
bound
by
an
agreement.
