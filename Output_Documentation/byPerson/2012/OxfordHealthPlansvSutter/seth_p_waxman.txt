mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
stolt-nielsen,
this
court
held
first
that
a
party
may
not
be
compelled
to
submit
to
arbitration
unless
there
is
a
contractual
basis
for
concluding
that
the
party
agreed
to
do
so;
and
second,
that
because
class
arbitration
changes
the
nature
of
arbitration
to
such
a
degree
that
it
cannot
be
presumed
that
parties
consented
to
class
arbitration
simply
by
agreeing
to
submit
their
disputes
to
an
arbitrator.
that
precisely
describes
this
case.
the
agreement
commits
the
parties
to
submit
their
disputes
to
arbitration
and
says
nothing
about
class
arbitration.
there
is
no
extrinsic
evidence
suggesting
that
the
parties
ever
considered
such
a
prospect,
and
there
is
no
background
principle
of
state
law
that
favors
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
ginsburg,
two
things.
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
page
10
--
or
page
14,
footnote
7
of
our
yellow
brief,
you'll
see
all
of
the
references
made
in
the
advocacy
before
the
state
court
judge
by
my
--
my
brother
here,
not
recognizing
repeatedly
that
what
oxford
was
asking
for
was
a
dismissal
and
a
transfer
to
individual
arbitration
--
bilateral
arbitration.
there
was
no
mistake
whatsoever
in
the
new
jersey
state
courts
that
oxford's
position
was
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes
--
that
bilateral
arbitration
was
what
was
requested,
and
--
but
there
was
similarly
no
dispute
that
both
parties
--
certainly
oxford
took
the
position
based
on
an
understanding
of
new
jersey
law
at
the
time,
because
this
court
hadn't
decided
class
action
question,
that
the
decision
would
be
submitted
in
the
first
instance
to
the
arbitrator
as
it
was
in
stolt-nielsen.
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
i
apologize.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
the
first
instance,
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
there
was
a
mistake
here.
i
think
it
was
--
it
was
understandable
in
light
of
the
state
of
the
law
in
2002.
but
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
justice
sotomayor,
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
vary
in
any
material
respect
the
highly
deferential
standard
that's
reflected
in
section
10(a)(4)
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
but
we
are
asking
that
that
generally
applicable
standard
of
review
be
applied
to
a
question
with
a
very
strong
empirical
presumption
that
the
faa
has
attached
to
it
and
this
court
has
announced,
which
is,
that
absent
an
actual
agreement
by
the
contracting
parties
that
they
will
permit
their
disputes
to
be
arbitrated
on
a
class
basis,
an
inference
that
may
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
be
derived
from
an
agreement
to
submit
all
disputes
to
arbitration--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
in
this
case,
you
defer,
as
you
always
do,
but
you
--
you
--
you
--
you
have
to
provide
--
there
is
some
level
of
review.
it's
not
just
because
the
arbitrator
says,
i've
looked
at
the
contract
and
i
think
this.
as
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again,
including
in
stolt,
just
saying
something
is
so
doesn't
make
it
so.
there
is
deferential
review,
but
there
is
review.
and
the
review
is
of
a
proposition
that
this
court
has
now
said
twice
strongly
presumes
that
there
is
--
there
is
no
agreement
to
arbitrate
as
a
class
unless
it
is
clearly
shown
to
be
so,
and
that
that
showing
is
not
satisfied
by
an
all-disputes
clause.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--so,
i
--
i
think
--
i
mean,
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
that
class
--
that
the
question
of
class
versus
bilateral
arbitration
is
a
special
kind
of
question
under
the
faa
as
to
which
the
federal
arbitration
act
itself
applies
a
rule
of
decision.
and
therefore,
the
question
i
suppose
is,
when
a
court
looks
at
a
--
an
assertion
by
an
arbitrator
that
the
language
of
the
contract
permits
--
and
in
this
case,
the
arbitrator
found
that
it
required
class
arbitration
--
a
court
has
to
ascertain
whether
that
assertion
of
fact
is
at
least
plausible,
or,
to
use
the
vernacular
of
this
court
in
stolt-nielsen,
the
court
said
in
stolt-nielsen
that
the
stipulation
left
no
room
for
an
argument
that
the
parties
had
agreed.
and
similarly
here,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
everyone
agrees
in
this
case,
as
one
would
have
to,
based
on
the
holding
in
stolt-nielsen,
that
if
the
--
this
arbitration
clause
in
this
case
just
said
all
disputes
will
be
arbitrated,
not
litigated,
that
the
arbitrator
could
not
--
the
arbitrator
would
be
reversed
if
it
--
if
he
found
that
that
indicated
an
actual
agreement
of
the
parties
to
class
arbitration.
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
actual
holding
in
stolt-nielsen.
and
in
this
case,
that
sentence
is
indistinguishable
from
that
orthodox
clause.
all
that
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
not
to
be
pejorative,
but
i
would
say
this:
in
the
vernacular
of
stolt-nielsen,
this
language,
quote,
“
leaves
no
room
”
for
a
conclusion
that
the
parties
agree
to
arbitrate
on
the
facts--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
and
in
this
case,
a
question
of
federal
arbitration.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
let
me
--
let
me
--
let
me
refer
you
to
stolt-nielsen
first,
and
then
to
a
hypothetical
example
that
my
brother
gives.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
stolt-nielsen
said
--
i
--
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
you
mean
a
non-class
action
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
i
can't
--
i'm
sort
of
trying
to
scroll
through
all
your
arbitration
decisions.
i
can't
--
there
may
be.
i
can't
think
of
a
holding
of
this
--
well,
no,
i
guess
--
i
guess
first
options
is
an
example
in
which
the
arbitrator
found
that
the
parties
had
agreed
to
let
the
arbitrator
decide
the
arbitrability
question.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
court
reviewed
the
--
the
facts
of
the
case
and
said
there
is
no
way
that
the
kaplans
agreed
to
have
the
arbitrability
question
submitted.
and
if
i
may
--
i
realize
this
isn't
an
actual
case
--
but
my
brother
gives
the
example
of
a
form
of
deferential
review,
which
would
allow
a
court
to
examine
and
reverse
an
arbitrator's
decision
in
the
context
in
which
the
arbitration
agreement
says,
this
is
going
to
be
arbitrated
under
california
law,
and
the
arbitrator
says,
well,
i'm
going
to
apply
new
york
law
in
this
case
because
--
i
don't
know,
the
parties
have
all
moved
to
new
york
and
they
like
new
york
and
they
litigate
in
new
york.
my
brother
says
that
is
reviewable
and
reversible.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
have
here
a
clause
that
this
court
has
said
cannot
suffice
to
establish
actual
agreement
to
arbitrate
as
a
class.
and
the
arbitrator
has
said
nonetheless,
i
have
read
it
that
way.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
the
arbitration
clause
--
the
sentence
has
two
clauses.
one
says,
you
cannot
bring
a
civil
action
in
court
about
any
dispute
under
this
agreement,
you
must
settle
your
disputes
in
arbitration
is
completely
orthodox.
and
as
we
point
out
at
page
24,
note
3
of
our
blue
brief,
it's
quite
arguably
required
by
new
jersey
law
and
laws
of
other
states
that
say
to
be
perfectly
--
it
is
--
you
have
to
be
perfectly
clear
when
you
are
telling
a
contract
--
a
contracting
counterparty
that
disputes
will
be
arbitrated.
you
have
to
tell
them
that
that
means
that
they
cannot
bring
their
disputes
in
court.
and
a
rule
--
a
reading
of
this
--
i
mean,
i
--
i
submit
to
you
that,
consistent
with
grammar
and
ordinary
meaning
of
words,
it
cannot
be
plausibly
read
to
say
that
you
can't
bring
a
civil
action
about
any
dispute
in
court
means
that
you
can
--
you
are
agreeing
to
arbitrate
your
dispute
on
a
class
basis,
for
a
whole
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
agree
with
that
as
a
proposition
of
what
review
is
under
10(a)(4),
that
is
whether
the
arbitrator
exceeded
his
authority.
in
this
case,
in
the
context
of
the
question
about
actual
agreement
to
arbitrate
on
a
class,
as
a
class,
this
court
has
interpreted
federal
law
to
require
evidence
of
a
contractual
basis
of
actual
agreement
between
the
parties
and
has
precluded
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
an
arbitrator
from
inferring
such
agreement
from
an
all-disputes
clause.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
that
--
i
mean,
trying
i
think
is
not
a
defense.
what
i
would
say,
in
addition--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
but
he
did
not
take
cognizance
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
stolt-nielsen,
reiterated
in
concepcion,
that
you
may
not
infer
intent
from
an
agreement
to
submit
to
arbitration.
and
more
fundamentally,
he
did
not
heed
the
presumption
in
the
federal
--
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
that
this
court's
holdings
in
those
two
cases
reflects.
that
is,
there
--
this
court
said
in
concepcion
that
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
that
--
hard
to
believe
that
defendants
would
ever
bet
the
company
with
no
effective
means
of
review.
there
is
therefore
a
presumption
of
the
law
that,
absent
a
very
clear
statement
of
a
meeting
of
the
parties'
minds
there
is
no
consent.
but
he
indulged
the
opposite
presumption.
his
presumption
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kagan--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
are
not
--
you
didn't
say
the
words
“
clear
statement
”.
you
--
what
you
said
in
stolt-nielsen
--
what
you
held
in
stolt-nielsen
was
not
simply
that
parties
who
have
stipulated
can't
be
forced
into
class
arbitration.
what
you
held
was
that
you
cannot
have
class
arbitration
in
the
absence
of
affirmative
agreement
that
is
not
evidenced
by
an
all-disputes
clause;
and
the
--
that
background
--
that
strong
presumption
must
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
inform
the
arbitrator's
decision.
and
in
this
case,
not
only
didn't
it,
because
you
said,
look,
an
all-disputes
clause
doesn't
suffice.
and
he
said,
well,
there's
the
word
“
civil
action
”
in
here
and
i
think
that
that
not
only
suffices,
but
that
indicates
an
actual
agreement
to
require
class
arbitration.
that
doesn't
pass
any
test.
it
doesn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--arbitration
clauses
that
say
in
one
form
of
words
or
another
that
you
may
not
bring
any
dispute
to
court,
you
must
bring
all
disputes
to
arbitration,
is
--
is
utterly
commonplace.
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
clause
in
the
steelworkers'
trilogy.
i
mean,
they
--
there's
a
lot
of
citation
to
enterprise
wheel
in
this
case.
the
--
the
provision
in
--
in
the
steelworkers
agreement,
and
virtually
all
labor
agreements,
make
this
explicit.
it's
not
precisely
every
single
article
and
preposition
in
the
clause
here,
but
it
is
functionally
indistinct.
the
same
was
true--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
--
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
yes.
but
my
--
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
about
this,
i
submit
to
you
two
things:
number
one,
there
is
no
way
--
three
things:
number
one,
there
is
no
way
consistent
with
the
rules
of
grammar
that
one
can
read
this
sentence
as
sending
class
actions
to
arbitration,
requiring
class
arbitration.
number
two,
there
is
no
heed
by
the
arbitrator
--
number
two
is
that
--
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
this
clause
is
the
clause
that
is
orthodox,
that
was
at
issue
in
stolt-nielsen.
it's
the
same
as
the
one
the
fifth
circuit
decided
and
the
second
circuit
decided
in
the
cases,
the
other
cases
that
created
the
split
here.
it's
the
same
as
the
standard
labor
clause
that
was
at
issue
in
the
steelworkers
v.
enterprise
wheel.
and
--
and
this
is
my
other
point
--
it
is
plain
from
the
arbitrator's
decisions,
both
in
his
2003
decision
and
his
post-stolt-nielsen
2010
decision,
that
he
not
only
was
not
applying
the
federal
law
presumption
that
this
court
identified
in
stolt
and
concepcion,
but
he
was
applying
the
opposite
presumption.
he
said
in
2003
that
because
--
if
this
--
if
this
clause
wouldn't
be
construed
to
permit
or
require
class
arbitration,
it
would
mean
that
the
parties
had
agreed
not
to
resolve
their
disputes
in
any
forum
using
a
class
manner,
and
that
would
be,
quote,
"so
bizarre,
it
would
require
an
express
provision.
"
in
2010,
he
said,
well,
i
overshot
the
mark
here.
but
the
point
is
still
the
same.
and
this
is
on
page
41a
--
40a
and
41a
of
the
petition
appendix.
he
said,
the
--
the
point
is
that
if
he
is
not
allowed
to
bring
a
class
proceeding
in
arbitration
when
he
at
least
presumptively
was
in
state
court,
that
would
be
so
strange
that,
“
if
the
clause
”,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
second
full
paragraph
on
41a,
"if
the
clause
cannot
permit
dr.
sutter's
court
class
action
to
go
to
arbitration,
then
dr.
sutter's
original
class
action
must
be
outside
of
the
arbitration
agreement
altogether.
"
in
other
words,
he
was
indulging
a
presumption
that
it
is
so
unnatural--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--so
the
arbitrator
--
so
a
couple
of
responses.
the
arbitrators
in
stolt-nielsen
didn't
apply
--
didn't
construe
animalfeeds'
lawyers'
concession
at
oral
argument
before
the
arbitrators
the
same
way
this
court
did.
what
it
said
was
that
it
is
looking
at
the
language
of
the
contract
and
as
this
court's
majority
opinion
points
out,
there
are
several
textual
references
in
the
arbitrators'
decision,
and
they
decided,
well,
we're
interpreting
this,
applying,
i
think
they
said,
new
york
principles,
that
the
parties
didn't
agree
to
preclude
it,
therefore,
they
must
be
understood
to
have
permitted
it.
what
this
court
said
is:
as
a
matter
of
law,
no;
silence
doesn't
mean
consent.
consent
can
only
be
shown
in
this
type
of
decision
by
an
actual
agreement.
the
court
italicized
the
word
“
agreement
”
twice
in
its
opinion.
and
it
doesn't
show
actual
agreement
if
you
just
agree
to
arbitrate,
not
litigate,
your
disputes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
am
not
sure,
justice
alito,
if
the
record
shows.
i
believe
it's
by
the
hour.
the
--
the
point
is
that
what
this
court's
--
the
fact
that
there
was
a
stipulation
that
the
court
identified
in
stolt-nielsen
made
it
easier
to
apply
the
principle
that
you
--
that
--
that
actual
agreement
is
required,
but
you
can't
infer
it
from
an
all-disputes
clause
to
the
case.
the
court
said
that
the
stipulation,
quote,
"left
no
room
for
an
inquiry
regarding
the
parties'
consent.
"
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes,
i
do,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
you
--
so
if
you
--
an
arbitrator
exceeds
his
powers
if
it
--
if
he
decides
to
arbitrate
a
subject
matter
that
the
parties
have
not
agreed
to
arbitrate.
he
--
he
exceeds
--
he
or
she
exceeds
his
or
her
power
if
they
--
if
he
or
she
decides,
as
this
court
stated
in
stolt-nielsen,
that
you
agreed
to
arbitrate
with
someone
with
whom
you
didn't
agree
to
arbitrate.
that
is
this
case.
and
as
i
said,
we
are
not
at
the
--
if
you
asked
--
i
don't
--
i
would
apply
--
i
think
you
could
simply
apply
the
standard
that
you've
applied
in
stolt-nielsen,
which
is
the
“
leave
no
room
”
standard,
which
is
pretty
darn
deferential,
and
you
would
have
to
find
that
this
sentence,
in
light
of
federal
law
as
announced
by
stolt-nielsen,
leaves
no
room
for
a
conclusion
that
the
parties,
that
oxford
and
dr.
sutter
actually
agreed
to
class
arbitration
regarding
their
disputes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg,
neither
the
arbitrator
nor
any
of
the
courts
below
made
any
finding
about
whether
this
is
a
contract
of
adhesion
or
whether
this
is
a
so-called
negative
value
case.
there
was
litigation
over
federal
court
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
the
court
found
that
there
was,
in
part
based
on
evidence
that
oxford
submitted,
that
there
were
many
claims
that
were
far
in
excess
of
$75,000.
and
it
is
not
true
that
dr.
sutter's
claims
as
he
brought
them
to
arbitration
was
$1,000
or
anything
like
it.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
i
have
three
points,
two
small
ones
and
one
significant
one.
the
first
small
one
is
that
this
notion,
this
canard,
that
we
told
the
district
--
the
state
court
judge
that
class
actions
should
be
sent
to
arbitration
is
dispensed
with
on
pages
13
and
14
of
our
reply
brief,
following
the
sentence:
"tellingly,
sutter
resorts
in
part
to
misrepresenting
oxford's
previous
positions.
"
and
i
refer
the
court
again
specifically
to
footnote
7
on
page
14,
where
we
quote
my
brother's
statements
to
the
state
court
judge
explaining
that
what
we
were
asking
for
was,
quote,
"a
motion
to
compel
individual
arbitration.
"
the
second
small
point
goes
to
the
issue
of
what
the
number
is
of
class
arbitrations.
i
also
don't
know
that.
but
we
know
that
as
of
this
court's
decision
in
stolt-nielsen,
because
this
was
reported
in
the
aaa
amicus
brief,
that
not
a
single
final
decision
had
been
rendered
prior
to
--
as
of
the
time
of
stolt-nielsen,
in
any
class
arbitration.
the
aaa
class
arbitration
rules
were
adopted
after
this
court's
decision
in
bazzle,
which
left
open
the
possibility,
a
possibility
that
the
arbitrator
in
this
case
said
was
surprising,
because
the
arbitrator
said
quite
correctly
that
everyone
expected
that
in
bazzle
this
court
would
say
there's
no
such
thing
as
class
arbitration.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
can't
go
back
200
years,
but
let's
just
go
to
1960
in
terms
of
the
standard.
and
in
the
steelworkers
v.
the
enterprise
wheel
case,
what
this
court
held
was,
quote,
"an
award
is
legitimate
only
so
long
as
it
draws
its
essence
from
the
agreement.
"
"when
the
arbitrator's
words
manifest
an
infidelity
to
this
obligation,
courts
have
no
choice
but
to
refuse
enforcement
of
the
award.
"
and
our
submission
is
that
this
award,
the
conclusion
that
the
all-disputes
provision
here
manifested
an
actual
agreement
by
the
parties
to
class
arbitration,
cannot
possibly
be
reconciled
with
the
plain
language
or
stolt-nielsen's
holding.
thank
you.
