justice
antonin
scalia
you're
--
you're
saying
that
this
is
off
the
wall.
that's
your
--
to
put
it
in
--
in
justice
ginsburg's
terms,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
that
the
--
that
the
deference
which
we
give
to
arbitrator's
statement
of
fact,
like
the
deference
we
give
to
a
lower
court's
adjudication
of
fact,
has
a
limit,
that
at
some
point,
the
distortion
of
fact
becomes
an
issue,
a
question
of
law
rather
than
fact,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
other
examples
from
other
--
other
review
that
we've
given
to
arbitrators'
factual
decisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
adopt
a
special
rule
for
--
for
class
actions,
but
if
--
if
you're
telling
me
this
is
just
a
general
principle,
that
at
some
point
if
it's
too
much
off
the
wall,
it
becomes
an
error
of
law
and
--
and
we
can
reverse
it.
what
--
what
other
examples
do
--
do
we
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
want
a
case.
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
is
a
class
action
case.
i
--
i
don't
care
what
it
said.
i
want
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
want
a
case
where
we
have,
or
where
federal
courts
have
with
our
approval,
disregarded
a
--
a
factual
finding
by
an
arbitrator
because
the
factual
finding
was
too
much
off
the
wall;
that
there
was
simply
not
enough
basis
to
support
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
--
that's
all
he
has
to
do
is
saying,
you
know,
i'm
--
i'm
interpreting
the
contract,
and
whatever
he
says
is
okay
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
--
we
were
concerned
in
stolt-nielsen
about
a
--
a
--
a
company
betting
the
company,
right,
on
--
on
class
action
whenever
--
whenever
it
agrees
to
arbitration,
because
class
arbitration,
you
know,
will
bankrupt
the
company
and
without
an
appeal
to
the
court
or,
you
know,
not
--
not
--
not
much
of
an
appeal
anyway.
and
you're
saying
that,
in
effect,
you
do
bet
the
company
every
time.
so
long
as
you
leave
it
up
to
the
arbitrator
to
decide
whether
there's
a
class
action
allowed
or
not,
which
most
agreements
probably
do,
he
can
find
whatever
he
likes,
right?
he
can
find
--
so
long
as
he
says,
i'm
interpreting
the
agreement,
it
can
be
as
wildly
inconsistent
with
the
agreement
as
you
like
and
there's
nothing
the
courts
can
do
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that
standard
--
all
that
standard
means
is
that
the
arbitrator
has
to
say
is,
i
am
interpreting
the
contract,
even
though
what
he
says
is
flatly,
visibly,
unquestionably
contrary
to
what
the
contract
says,
and
the
court
has
to
accept
that,
so
long
as
he
says,
i'm
interpreting
the
contract.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
exactly
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
supports
his
decision?
i
mean,
you
--
you
say
that.
what
--
what
supports
his
decision
that
the
parties
here
agreed,
agreed,
that's
the
standard.
did
they
agree
to
class
arbitration?
what
--
what
supports
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
there
is
a
distinction
between
all
disputes
and
all
actions
relating
to
the
dispute?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
top
of
page
6?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
enough.
as
stated
by
justice
breyer,
he
has
to
have
come
to
a
plausible
construction.
it's
not
enough
that
he
said,
i'm
construing
the
contract;
i
have
looked
at
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
what
the
parties'
said,
and
my
construction
of
the
contract
is
x.
that's
not
enough.
it
has
to
be
plausible.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
is
this
plausible?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
a
magic
8-ball?
i
don't
know
what
you
are
talking
about.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
did
these
other
people
agree
to
this
arbitrator?
i
mean,
they
might
have
said,
this
arbitrator,
he's
a
wild
guy,
he's
going
to
say
that
--
that
we
agreed
to
class
action.
we
didn't
agree
to
class
--
i
don't
want
this
arbitrator.
they
didn't
agree
to
this
arbitrator.
why
should
they
be
bound
by
--
by
whatever
he
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
they
opt
out
if
they've
agreed
to
class
arbitration?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure?
it
seems
to
me
if
they've
agreed
to
class
arbitration,
they've
agreed
to
class
arbitration.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
have
there
been?
have
there
been
dozens,
hundreds,
thousands?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
there's
been
a
number.
what's
the
number?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
be
less
than
100?
