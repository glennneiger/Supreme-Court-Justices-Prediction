mr.
eric
d.
katz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
out
by
discussing
the
applicable
standard.
there
are
only
two
ways
a
losing
party
can
vacate
an
arbitration
award
under
10(a)(4),
which
is
the
only
standard
that
applies
here.
it's
the
only
question
that
came
up
to
this
court
on
cert
and
--
under
the
exceeding
powers
standard.
number
one,
the
arbitrator
had
no
authority
to
interpret
the
contract;
or
number
2,
the
award
was
based
not
on
an
interpretation
of
the
contract.
oxford
cannot
satisfy
either
of
those
standards
here.
oxford
does
not
dispute
that
the
arbitrator
interpreted
the
contract.
oxford's
sole
dispute
here
or
challenge
is
that
the
--
that
the
arbitrator
interpreted
the
contract
incorrectly.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
justice--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--justice
scalia,
stolt-nielsen
taught
us
that
the
language
of
the
contract
or
any
other
evidence
has
to
demonstrate
the
--
that
the
parties
agreed
to
class
arbitration.
stolt-nielsen
did
not
alter
this
10(a)(4)
standard,
the
same
standard
which
before
it
was
codified--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--this
court's
jurisprudence
for
almost
2
centuries
has
held
just
exactly
that.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
there
--
well,
there
is
a
basis.
what
misco
--
as
i
understand
what
misco
teaches
is
that
it
has
to
be
unambiguous,
that
the
arbitrator--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
manifest
disregard
--
certainly,
manifest
disregard
is
not
a
standard
by
which
this
matter
has
come
up
before
the
court.
and
this
court
has
held
in
hall
street
and
other
cases
that
10(a)(4)
is
the
exclusive
ground
set
forth
by
congress,
that
this
court
did
not
have
the
authority
--
and
i'm
quoting
the
court
--
it
"did
not
have
the
authority
to
expand.
"
mr.
eric
d.
katz
no,
justice
breyer,
because
here
both
sides,
not
only
in
2003,
but
in
2010
after
stolt-nielsen,
came
to
the
arbitrator
and
said,
we
want
you
to
decide
it.
they
told
the
arbitrator
at
that
time,
look
at
the
agreement,
look
at
what
transpired
in
2002,
back
when
this
matter
was
in
the
superior
court
and
make
your
decision.
so
the
arbitrator
applied
the
law
that
--
and
applied
the
--
the
standard
that
he
was
told
to
apply.
he
didn't
just
disregard
it.
he
didn't
make
a
decision
saying,
i
don't
care
what
you
are
telling
me
to
do.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
justice
scalia,
they
did
agree.
when
we
were
in
court
in
2002,
oxford
represented
to
the
state
court
judge
there
that
not
only
are
the
disputes
going
to
arbitration,
but
all
actions
regarding
the
dispute.
and
the
judge
specifically
relied
upon
that,
expressly
relied
upon
that,
in
not
sending
just
the
disputes,
but
sending
everything
that
had
been
asserted
by
dr.
sutter,
including
the
claims
of
the
class.
and
the
arbitrator--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--oxford
made
that
distinction
in
2002.
in
fact
--
and
we
point
this
out
in
our
brief
on
page
5,
the
red
brief,
where
oxford
has
expressly
--
it's
both
on
page
5
and
page
6
and
i
will
refer
to
page
6,
the
top
of
6.
this
is
oxford's
counsel
in
2002.
“
the
contract
”--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--the
top
of
page
6,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
plaintiff
quoted
the
contract
here
as
saying
"that
any
dispute
under
the
contract
needs
to
be
arbitrated.
"
that's
wrong,
the
contract
says
“
actions
concerning
any
dispute
”.
that
is
what
oxford
has
always
argued
at
all
times
before
the
arbitrator.
the
arbitrator
understood
that.
the
arbitrator
interpreted
the
agreement.
it's
based
both
on
the
agreement
and
on
the
representations
made
by
oxford
as
to
what
its
own
agreement
meant.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
the
arbitrator,
however,
mr.
chief
justice,
cannot
be
faulted
or
his
award
vacated
based
upon
changes
or
arguments
that
were
never
made
at
the
time.
the
parties
made
their
arguments
to
the
arbitrator.
oxford,
if
you
will,
sat
on
the
sidelines.
and
this
court
has
also
held
that
a
party
cannot
sit
on
the
sidelines,
wait
till
the
award
comes
down,
and
when
it's
against
them
then
raise
new
arguments
for
the
first
time.
oxford--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--i'm
sorry.
i
was
just
going
to
finish
saying,
oxford
could
have
raised
these
arguments
and
maybe
at
the
end
of
the
day,
if
they
raised
these
arguments,
they
would
have
carried
the
day.
but
i
respectfully
submit,
as
this
court
repeatedly
held,
that
courts
do
not
have
the
authority
to
second-guess
the
arbitrator
and
make
decisions
or
come
up
with
a
resolution
that
would
have
been
different
with
the
arbitrator
just
because
they
disagree.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
arbitrator
did
exactly
what
the
parties
had
asked
him
to
do,
though.
he
did
not
venture
and
do
something
outside
of
what
the
parties
had
asked
them.
the
parties
specifically
presented
the
question
to
the
arbitrator
as
to
whether
class
arbitrations
were
available
and
specifically
directed
the
arbitrator
both
to
the
agreement,
the
language
in
the
agreement,
as
well
as
the
representations
and
the
submissions
that
were
made
below
in
the
court
system
in
making
their
respective
arguments.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
that
is
correct.
oxford
has
always
maintained
that
it
was
the
arbitrator's
decision
to
make,
and
in
2010,
even
after
stolt-nielsen,
came
back
to
the
arbitrator
and
asked
the
arbitrator
to
reconsider
his
opinion
from
2003.
the
--
oxford
had
never,
until
after
losing
this
case
obviously,
has
oxford
sought
the
court
for
the
first
time
for
a
de
novo
interpretation.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
answering
that
--
answering
that
hypothetical,
assuming
that
was--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
if
there
was
a
manifest
disregard--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
the
arbitrator
did
not
manifestly
disregard.
the
arbitrator
did
what
the
parties
wanted
the
arbitrator
to
do.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
i
don't
believe
that
is
--
justice
breyer,
i
don't
believe
that
is
a
manifest
disregard.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
and
the
reason
being
is
that
the
arbitrator
based
his
determination
on
the
standards
or
the
materials
that
were
put
forth
before
him,
the
agreement
and
the
evidence,
and
he
made
a
decision.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
yes.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
plausibility
comes
into
play.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
justice
ginsburg,
what
the
arbitrator
had
found
was
that
the
“
no
civil
action
”
part
of
the
clause
was
--
was
coextensive.
it
was
completely
interrelated
with
the
mandatory
arbitration
provision.
in
other
words,
what
the
arbitrator
found
was
that
everything
that
was
prohibited
from
being
filed
in
a
litigation
in
the
court
had
to
be
arbitrated,
and
that
was
based
on
not
only--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
this
specific
agreement
was
dr.
sutter
and
oxford,
but
there
are
20,000
physicians
who
had
signed
the
same
agreement.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
correct.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
the
arbitrate--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
the
arbitrator
made
the
decision
based
on
the
language
and
the
evidence
presented
before
him
and
finding
that
it
authorized
class
arbitration.
that
was
the
determination
that
was
made
initially.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
they
all
--
they
all
had
the--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--that
--
that
is
correct.
now,
ultimately,
when
the
matter
was
certified--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
the--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
justice
alito,
this
--
this
is
no
different
than
in
any
other
contract
interpretation
issue.
the
arbitrator
makes
a
determination
based
upon
the
reading
of
the
language
and
what
the
parties
are
telling
him
that
language
means.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
but
stolt-nielsen,
which
the
arbitrator
faithfully
reviewed,
analyzed,
and
followed,
makes
clear
that
you
can
have
class
arbitration
as
long
as
the
arbitrator
determines
that
the
contracting
parties
to
that
agreement
establish
that
class
arbitration
is
available.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
for
one
thing,
justice
scalia,
that's
exactly
what
oxford
wanted.
oxford
argued
that
the
class
action
should
go
into
arbitration.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
ultimately,
they
could
--
they
could
opt
out
when
it
was
certified.
and
i
want
to
--
i'd
like
to
be
clear
on
a
point,
if
i
may.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
they
can
opt
out
of
the
class
and
pursue,
if
they
wanted
to
at
that
point,
an
individual
arbitration
if
that's
what
they
chose
to
do.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
they
--
they
proceeded
--
they
agreed
for
the
matter
to
proceed
as
a
class
proceeding.
but
the
matters--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
that
is
before
we
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
class
itself
be
certified.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
justice
kennedy,
the
determination
that
this
matter
could
proceed
as
a
class
arbitration
was
only
the
first
issue
that
was
decided.
we
then
engaged
in
the
procedural
mechanism
by
which
the
matter
could
be
certified
and
that
they
could--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--but
everyone,
justice
alito,
everyone
signs
the
same
agreement.
and
therefore,
if
the
arbitrator's
going
to
make
a
determination
here--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--if
--
if
it
was--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
in
any
class
arbitration,
the
arbitrator
is
not
going
to
decide
the
same
questions
as
to
the
20,000
of
the
same
agreements.
it's
decided
based
upon
the
class
representative
who
brings
the
matter.
and
even
if
the
arbitrator
was
wrong,
justice
alito,
i
submit
that
under
10(a)(4)
in
the
applicable
standard,
that
even
in
concepcion,
this
court
said
10(a)(4)
is
--
is
not
an
issue
of
mistake;
it's
an
issue
of
misconduct.
and
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
if
there
was
a
mistake,
that
still
would
not
be
enough
with
respect
to
the
courts
to
have
vacated
the
arbitrator's
determination
on
this
matter.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
this
has
been
going
on
11
years.
that
is
true.
it's
been
going
on--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
class
arbitration
is,
as
in
many
arbitrations
in
this
day
and
age,
involves
complex
issues,
that
sometimes
you
have
major
corporations
doing
battle
over
--
over
major
agreements
that
they
know
at
the
time
involved
big
ticket
items.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
justice
kennedy,
that
should
not
bear
on
the
decision
here,
because
this
matter
comes
up
under
10(a)(4).
if
there
were
questions
about
the
partiality
of
the
arbitrator,
then
i
want
to
rule
in
favor
of
katz,
because
i
want
to
prolong
this
thing
as
long
as
possible,
then
perhaps
oxford
should
have
brought
the
matter
under
10(a)(2)
and--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well,
the
matter
wasn't
in
the
new
jersey
courts
for
that
long,
but
various
points
in
time,
because
the
aaa
rules
allow
for
a
--
a
filing
of
a
federal
suit
to
vacate,
oxford,
on
multiple
occasions--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--partiality
is
not
a
factor,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--in
this
decision.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
in
this
decision,
because
partiality
or
what
could
potentially
be
perceived
as
a
subjective
intent,
so
the
arbitrator
does
not
play
under
10(a)(4).
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
arbitrators
--
i
would
submit
that
an
arbitrator
who
was
doing
something
that
was
--
that
was
documented
or
perceived
to
be
crazy
--
and
pardon
my
vernacular
--
or
just
way
out
of
line,
then
i'd
submit
that
arbitrator
is
not
going
to
be
hired
again.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
that's
correct.
i
think
it's
important
--
if
i
could
just
address
a
couple
of
points
regarding
that.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--well
--
i
don't
think
there
has
been
thousands,
but
there
--
i
know
there
have
certainly
been
a
number
so
far
that
the
american
arbitration
association
has
set
forth
rules--
mr.
eric
d.
katz
--i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
the
number.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
i
wouldn't
know
that,
justice
scalia.
but
--
if
i
may
point
this
out,
class
arbitrations
were
certainly
in
existence
at
the
time
that
this
matter
was
sent
into
class
arbitration.
and
in
fact,
i
think
it's
also
worthy
to
understand
that
when
i
brought
this
matter
in
superior
court,
i
argued
that
the
class
action
should
be
kept
in
court,
but
it
was
oxford's
argument
that
everything
including
the
class
action
go
into
arbitration.
it
was
oxford's
interpretation
of
its
own
clause
that
the
arbitrator
relied
upon,
which
puts
this
case
completely
outside
of
stolt-nielsen,
where
in
stolt-nielsen,
the
arbitrator
fashioned
his
--
their
own
rules
based
on
some
policy
preference
about
class
actions
which
wasn't
present
here.
and
if
i
could
address
an
issue
that
was
raised
about
--
that
the
arbitrator
discussed
something
that
was
bizarre.
in
2003,
that
was
a
pre
--
so
that
was
prior
to
stolt-nielsen
--
the
arbitrator
expressly
disavowed
that
in
his
2010
opinion.
and
he
made
it
very
clear
that
he
based
his
decisions
on
the
interpretation
of
the
agreement
as
well
as
the
representations
made
as
to
what
that
agreement
meant
to
the
court
system.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
for
2
centuries
that
an
arbitrator's
error
in
law
or
fact
cannot
be
the
grounds
for
a
vacatur.
mr.
eric
d.
katz
but
here,
both
sides,
mr.
chief
justice,
expressly
asked
the
arbitrator.
this
is
not
a
question
of
arbitrability
because
both
sides
wanted
the
arbitrator
to
make
that
decision.
then
even
after
2010,
when
it
came
to
light
that
bazzle
--
there
was
a
plurality
and
the
issue
of
whether
it's
a
question
of
arbitrability
is
an
open
question;
oxford
didn't
go
running
to
court
then.
instead,
it
went
back
to
the
arbitrator
and
said,
we
want
you
to
reconsider
your
2003
decision.
and
the
arbitrator
again
went
through
the
analysis
of
interpreting
the
agreement
and
the
representations
made
by
the
parties
about
what
that
agreement
meant.
i
submit
we
have
to
--
if
we
trust
arbitrators
to
handle
such
important
issues
as
civil
rights
issues
and
other
very
important
matters
of
singular
importance,
we
have
to
expect
that
they
will
follow
the
precepts
of
this
court
and
the
faa
as
to
what
constitutes
grounds
for
class
arbitration.
i
think
the
third
circuit
should
be
affirmed,
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
