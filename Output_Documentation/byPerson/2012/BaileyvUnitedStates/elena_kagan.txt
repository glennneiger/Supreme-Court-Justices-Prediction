and
what
is
the
immediate
vicinity?
how
would
you
define
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
what
if
he
were
aware,
or
what
if
there
was
reason
to
think
he
might
be
aware,
would
you
then
allow
the
police
to
do
what
the
police
did
here?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
shanmugam,
when
you
talk
about
the
justifications
in
your
brief
and
just
now,
you
talk
about
two;
but,
there
were,
in
fact,
three,
and
the
third
was
flight.
so
how
is
it
that
that's
dropped
from
your
understanding
of
summers?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
wall,
you
have
that,
too,
about
the
person
in
her
workplace,
and
you
said
that
your
argument
didn't
apply
to
the
person
in
her
workplace.
so
you
have
to
come
up
with
something
better
than
that.
and
i
guess
the
question
is
your
rule
would
seem
to
encompass,
you
know,
a
whole
set
of
people
who
are
leaving
their
houses
for
ordinary
reasons:
i'm
going
to
work
in
the
morning.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
police
can
stop
this
person
who's
going
to
work
in
the
morning,
who's
given
no
indication
that
he's
seen
the
police
officers
at
the
scene,
no
indication
that
he's
coming
back
immediately
or,
you
know,
in
any
amount
of
time
that
it
will
take
you
to
complete
the
search.
and
that's
not
an
outlier
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hypothetical
i
just
gave
you
might
very
well
be
the
more
common
case
than
the
hypothetical
that
you
gave
me.
so,
you
know,
why
isn't
this
just
too
broad
a
categorical
rule?
justice
elena
kagan
right.
but
the
across-the-board
is
a
set
of
people
who
are
at
the
house
when
you
want
to
search
the
house.
and
of
course,
some
of
this
makes
perfect
sense.
you
want
to
search
the
house,
you
can't
have
these
people
roaming
around,
right?
so
you
have
to
detain
the
people.
but
what
you're
now
saying
is:
well,
there's
another
class
of
people,
they're
going
to
work
in
the
morning.
and
we've
--
there's
--
there
is
no
indication
that
they've
seen
the
police
officers;
they're
going
to
work.
but
we
get
to
detain
them,
too,
just
because
we
have
a
warrant
to
search
the
house.
and
the
question
is
why?
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
something
meaningful
very
--
very
much
changes.
before,
you're
dealing
with
a
problem
of
a
person
on
the
premises
while
you're
trying
to
search
the
premises.
and
now
you're
talking
about
a
person
who
is
going
to
work,
leaving
the
premises,
letting
you
search
the
premises
without
any
interference.
