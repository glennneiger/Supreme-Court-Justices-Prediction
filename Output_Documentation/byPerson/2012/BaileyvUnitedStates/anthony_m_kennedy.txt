if

if
you
think
that
leaving

in
justice
kagan's
hypothetical,
that
he's
leaving
the

with
incriminating
evidence,
at

point
you
have

you
have
a

he's
right

he's
just
leaving

something?

what
would
you
think
generally
in
my
hypothetical?
there'd
be
hundreds
of
other
facts,
but--
justice

--just
--
just
before
the
search,
yes.
justice

right.

i

we
have
to
take
the
case
on
the
assumption

i
agree
with
you
there
probably
was
probable
cause

but
i
think
you
have
to
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
arrest,
because
they
didn't
--
they
did
not
rely
on
that
authority.

justice

had
the
hypothetical
of
the

leaving
to

the
9:00

person.
suppose
the

going

can
they
detain
him
at
his
office
so
that
he

back--
he
always
goes
right
home.
he
takes
the

can
you

no,

you're

this
is
bailey
versus
the
united
states
as
the
chief
justice
has
just
indicated.
the
case
began
with
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
for
a
place,
but
in
the
end,
it
concerns
the
detention
of
the
person
and
the
resulting
seizure
of
evidence
from
that
person.
the
place
to
be
searched
was
a
basement
apartment
in
a
town
in
long
island,
new
york.
an
informant
told
the
police
he
had
observed
a
gun
when
he
was
there
to
purchase
drugs
for
the
man
known
as
polo.
this
information
was
the
basis
for
the
search
warrant
for
the
apartment.
the
police
obtained
a
warrant
and
assembled
a
search
team.
a
few
minutes
before
ten
in
the
evening,
two
detectives
were
keeping
the
premises
under
surveillance.
the
search
team
had
not
yet
arrived,
apparently.
while
the
search
team
was
preparing
to
go
to
the
premises,
the
detectives
saw
two
men
leaving
the
apartment.
both
men
appeared
to
match
the
general
description
of
polo,
and
one
of
them
later
turned
out
to
be
polo
and
he
assumed
bailey,
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
bailey
and
the
other
men
left
in
a
car.
the
detectives
waited
for
that
car
to
pull
away
and
followed
in
their
own
unmarked
police
car.
they
followed
for
a
distance
of
about
seven-tenths
of
a
mile
and
for
about
five
minutes.
the
detectives
signaled
the
men
to
stop
and
ordered
them
out
of
their
car.
a
patdown
search
of
bailey
produced
a
set
of
keys
which
the
detectives
took.
both
men
were
put
in
handcuffs.
the
detectives
call
for
a
marked
patrol
car
to
take
the
men
back
to
the
apartment,
the
scene
of
the
search.
in
the
meantime,
the
search
had
taken
place
and
had
revealed
guns
and
drugs
in
plain
view
in
the
apartment.
bailey
was
then
arrested
and
charged
with
federal
drug
and
weapons
offenses.
at
trial,
he
objected
to
the
admission
of
the
keys
found
in
the
patdown
search
into
the
admission
of
certain
statements
that
he
made
when
he
was
first
stopped
by
the
detectives.
and
it
is
the
admissibility
of
that
evidence
which
presents
the
issue
here.
the
united
states
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
bailey's
detention
and
ensuing
search
were
permissible
as
incident
to
the
search
of
the
apartment.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
rule
that
allows
detention
of
those
who
are
on
the
premises
to
be
searched
can
be
applied
to
persons
beyond
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
search
scene.
and
this
court
now
holds
that
the
execution
of
a
warrant
to
search
a
premises
cannot
support
the
stop
and
detention
of
an
individual
who
is
away
from
the
scene
of
the
search
because
bailey
was
not
on
the
premises
or
in
the
immediate
vicinity
when
the
stop
and
detention
took
place,
that
stop,
detention,
and
search
of
his
person
cannot
be
justified
as
necessary
for
the
search
of
the
apartment.
the
court
has
recognized
that
officers
can
detain
occupants
of
the
premises
while
a
lawful
search
is
in
progress
and
even
restrain
those
occupants
in
handcuffs.
the
two
principal
cases
discussed
in
the
opinion
in
which
--
discussed
that
proposition
are
michigan
versus
summers
and
muehler
versus
mena.
those
cases
go
quite
far,
for
they
allow
detention
even
without
a
particular
suspicion
that
an
individual
is
involved
in
criminal
activity
or
poses
a
specific
danger
to
the
officers.
the
detention
is
allowed
in
order
to
ensure
the
efficacy
of
the
search.
and
the
interest
that
allow
this
detention
includes
safety
considerations,
so
the
officers
can
search
without
fear
that
an
occupant
will
become
dangerous
or
disruptive
to
the
search,
and
so
that
the
search
can
be
completed
without
occupant's
hiding
or
destroying
evidence
and
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
search
by
preventing
flight
of
the
occupants
who
are
on
the
scene.
a
detention
of
a
person
to
protect
the
search
for
those
reasons,
however,
must
be
confined
to
those
persons
who
are
on
the
premises
to
be
searched
or
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
there
would
be
no
adequate
limiting
principle
or
a
rule
to
allow
detention
of
persons
beyond
the
premises
of
the
search.
a
spatial
constraint
defined
by
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
premises
being
searched
is
required
for
detention
under
the
summers
rationale.
and
as
these
facts
indicate,
when
detention
occurs
away
from
the
premises,
there's
an
added
public
stigma
and
indignity
in
being
seized
in
public,
placed
in
handcuffs,
and
transported
back
to
the
place
where
the
search
is
taking
place.
for
these
reasons,
it
was
error
to
admit
the
evidence
based
on
a
rule
in
michigan
versus
summers.
the
district
court
had
held
that
an
alternative
basis
for
sustaining
bailey's
detention
is
the
rule
allowing
certain
stops
and
searches
based
on
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity
under
our
case
in
terry
versus
ohio.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
breach
the
terry
issue
and
neither
does
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
can
address
that
matter
on
remand,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg
and
kagan
joined.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
thomas
and
alito
joined.
