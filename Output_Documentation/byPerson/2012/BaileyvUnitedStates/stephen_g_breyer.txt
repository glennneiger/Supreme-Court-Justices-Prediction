what
is
the
actual
difference?
i
mean,
you
have
two
officers
or
three.
if
they
go
into
the
property
and
somebody's
there,
they
can
detain
them,
and
summers
gives
three
reasons:
one,
as
justice
kagan
pointed
out,
preventing
flight
in
the
event
that
incriminating
evidence
is
found.
we
are
considering
now
the
case
where,
instead
of
going
and
detaining
the
people,
the
people
inside
the
house
walk
out
and
there
are
two
officers
in
a
patrol
car
or
an
unmarked
car
outside
waiting
to
go
in.
okay.
that
seems
to
me
identical,
as
you
said.
the
last
one
is
facilitating
orderly
completion
of
the
search.
that
seems
to
me
identical.
you
want
the
person
there
so
that
he
can
open
a
drawer,
so
he
can
unlock
a
closet,
et
cetera,
okay.
identical.
the
third
one,
where
there
is
the
only
place
for
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
is
minimizing
the
risk
of
harm
to
the
officers.
now,
the
harm,
risk
of
harm
to
the
officers
i
guess
if
he
goes
into
the
house
is
that,
well,
if
they
leave,
they
might
come
back,
goodness
knows,
and
they
would
see
they
are
looking
for
the
drugs,
da,
da,
da.
or
maybe
they
will
rush
out,
or
maybe
there
will
be
a
--
well,
any,
goodness
knows
what.
here
i
can
see
a
slight
difference,
but
maybe
not.
i
don't
know.
maybe
they
will
come
back.
maybe
they
noticed
the
people
in
the
car
outside.
maybe
they
didn't.
certainly
the
policemen
don't
know.
and
they
might
go
in
quicker,
and
then
the
others
will
be
alerted.
i
mean,
when
you
talk
generally
about
a
risk
of
harm
to
the
police,
it
seems
to
me
pretty
close,
if
not
identical.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
am
i
missing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
already
said
the
first
one's
identical.
i
don't
see
how
the
third
one
could
change,
and
what
about
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
know
that?
they
are
sitting
outside
in
the
car.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
just
that.
it's
that
they
might
want
to
get
in
quicker
to
stop
this
person
from
leaving
because
he's
the
one
who
knows
where
the
drugs
are.
at
least
that's
what
they
think.
or
they
start
to
shout,
and
alert
the
others.
or
--
i
mean,
i
have
never
conducted
such
a
search,
you
know,
so
i
don't
know
the
risks
involved
there,
but
i
can
see
the
possibilities.
and
probably
you
might
have
conducted
them,
but
i
don't
know.
so
how
am
i
supposed
to
answer
this
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
problem.
the
police
have
to
know
what
they're
supposed
to
do
when
they
go
in
to
search
a
house,
all
right?
and
they
know
that
sometimes
they
can
keep
the
people
there,
and
you
are
saying,
but
they
can't
stop
them
from
leaving
if
they're
not
--
all
of
a
sudden,
i'm
a
policeman,
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do
exactly
because
i
don't
know
how
to
fill
in
that
blank.
and
therefore,
i
might
rush
in
--
i
don't
know
--
i
see
a
recipe
for
a
mess,
and
that's
what
--
and
the
mess
could
involve
physical
harm,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
can't
stop
them
from
leaving
if,
blank.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
it
in
the
process?
does
summers
apply
and
does
this
apply
only
when
the
police
are
in
the
process
of
executing
a
valid
search
warrant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
--
if
the
police
executing
the
valid
search
warrant
walked
through
the
gate
and
at
that
moment
the
individual
emerging
from
the
house
had
not
yet
passed
through
the
gate,
then
under
summers
the
police
would
have
the
right
to
detain
him.
all
right.
so
the
question
here
is
he's
walked
through
the
gate.
now,
i
guess
the
police
--
all
right,
i
see.
the
police
objection
is:
i
don't
know.
these
things
are
complicated
and
we
might
not
want
to
push
him
back.
i
don't
know
what
the
neighborhood
is
like
and
maybe
somebody
will
get
killed.
i
mean,
that's
the
kind
of
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
you'd
say
that
was
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
he
had
a
key
to
the
--
to
the
place
where
they
keep
the
drugs,
the
basement
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
fanciful?
is
it
fanciful
that
people
who
are
searched
open
doors
or--
