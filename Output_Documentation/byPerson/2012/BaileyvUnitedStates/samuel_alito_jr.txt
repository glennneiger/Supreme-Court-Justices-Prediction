justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
would
you
think
of
this
situation?
officers
have
a
no-knock
warrant,
and
they're
--
they're
at
the
house.
they
see
somebody
come
out
the
door
and
start
to
go
down
the
steps,
doesn't
look
like
that
person
has
noticed
their
presence.
now,
they
have
the
choice,
if
you
prevail,
of
either
rushing
in
and
stopping
the
person
within
the
curtilage,
in
which
case
they
could
detain
the
person,
or
they
could
allow
the
person
to
walk
some
distance
outside
of
the
site
of
the
house
and
then
stop
the
person,
and
that
would
allow
them
to
execute
the
warrant
without
endanger
--
without
enhancing
the
danger
to
them
from
potentially
armed
people
inside
or
allowing
of
the
destruction
of
evidence.
what
--
in
that
situation,
what
argues
in
favor
of
your
rule,
that
if
they
want
to
detain
this
individual,
they
have
to
rush
in
and
stop
him
before
he
leaves
the
premises?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
without
interrupting
--
in
that
situation,
officer
safety
is
undermined
by
your
rule
because
it
requires
them
to
stop
the
person
on
the
premises
and,
therefore,
tip
off
those
inside,
potentially,
about
their
presence.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
explain
what
you
mean
by
the
immediate
vicinity?
is
it
based
on
--
on
property
line?
is
it
some
absolute
distance
from
the
--
the
entrance
to
the
premises?
is
it
based
on
how
far
you
could
see
from
the
--
the
site
of
the
search?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
the
person
comes
out
the
door
and
walks
--
and
has
walked
50
feet
down
the
block
within
sight
of
the
entrance
at
the
time
when
the
police
are
entering
to
make
the
arrest?
would
that
person
be
in
the
immediate
vicinity?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
that
if
the
person
is
within
sight
of
the
entrance
to
the
premises
at
the
time
when
the
police
enter,
then
that
person
can
be
searched--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
be
detained.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
--
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
exact
situation
in
summers?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
the
original
understanding
was
that
what
happened
in
summers
was
okay,
but
if
you
get
out
of
the
immediate
vicinity,
that's
where
they
drew
the
line?
