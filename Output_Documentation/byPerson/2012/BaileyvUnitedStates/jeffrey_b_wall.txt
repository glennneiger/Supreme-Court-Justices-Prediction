mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no,
justice
sotomayor.
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
start
there
because
i
think
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
much
of
his
argument
today
is
devoted
to
a
position
the
government's
not
taking.
so
let
me
be
very
clear.
in
the
government's
view,
summers
is
about
current
and
recent
occupants,
people
whom
police,
when
they
are
executing
the
warrant,
find
at
the
home
or
see
leaving
the
home
in
the
process
of
executing
a
warrant.
and
the
question
here
is
do
the
justifications
apply
equally
as
a
departing
occupant
steps
away
from
the
home
and
onto
a
sidewalk,
a
yard,
a
couple
blocks
away.
and
i
think
my
friend's
answer
to
that
has
a
wonderfully
abstract
quality
to
it
that
doesn't
engage
any
of
the
realities
on
the
ground.
justice
alito,
your
hypothetical
is
anything
but.
it
comes
very
close
to
the
facts
of
the
cochran
case
out
of
the
sixth
circuit.
police
arrive
at
the
scene.
the
occupant
is
known
to
carry
a
gun,
and
he
has
a
guard
dog.
so,
rather
than
walk
up
to
the
door,
they
wait
for
him
to
leave;
but,
by
the
time
they
can
catch
up
to
him,
he's
off
of
the
bounds
of
the
property,
but
he's
still
very
close
to
the
residence.
they
stop
him.
they
take
him
back
to
the
residence.
he
lets
the
officers
in.
he
secures
the
dog,
and
they
complete
the
search.
i
think
that
is
a
model
law
enforcement
practice,
and
it
is
indistinguishable
in
any
important
respect
from
what
went
on
in
summers.
the
justifications
for
detention
apply
equally
to
departing
occupants
when
they
are
seen
by
officers
leaving
in
the
process
of
executing
the
warrant.
but
no,
justice
sotomayor,
the
government
is
not
contending
that
other
connections
to
the
residence,
other
than
that
kind
of
observed
connection
by
the
officers,
could
justify
a
detention
under
summers.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
we
do
have,
though,
the
officers
seeing
him
departing
the
residence
as
they're
executing
the
warrant.
it's
a
no-knock
warrant
for
a
gun.
and
rather
than
stop
him
right
outside
the
house
because
they
don't
know
who
else
would
be
inside--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--no.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
they
had
obtained
the
warrant.
they
had
--
the
team
had--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
respectfully
disagree.
and
the
government
would
be
happy
to
have
this
case
decided
by
having
the
court
look
at
the
federal
and
state
cases,
look
at
the
risks
that
are
present
in
those
cases,
and
deciding
whether
the
interests
of
summers
are
served
in
those
cases.
what
we
see
in
the
cases
is
that
--
take
this
very
case,
for
instance.
petitioner
is
driving
his
friend
home
to
meet
a
court-imposed
probation
curfew,
and
he
is
then
returning
to
the
house.
i
think
the
reasonable
inference
in
the
record
is
that
he'll
be
back
in
a
matter
of
minutes.
so
he--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--but
think
how
formalistic
and
odd
that
is,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
police
see
someone
leaving,
but,
if
they
can't
catch
up
to
them
on
the
bounds
of
the
property,
which
has
no
reasonable
relationship
to
the
warrant
here,
which
was
for
the
premises,
not
for
the
--
for
that
property--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--oh,
assuming--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--they
often
do,
justice
scalia,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
certainly
in
urban
areas
they
do.
i
think
it's
more
difficult
where
you
have
smaller
police
departments
in
rural
areas.
but
the
government's
not
disputing
that
posting
sentries
is
a
good
idea.
that
doesn't
begin
to
take
care
of
the
most
serious
cases,
where
people
outside
of
the
area
of
the
search
fire
on
or
assault
officers.
so,
for
instance,
in
2008--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
sotomayor,
there
is
no
question
that
executing
a
warrant
is
dangerous,
and
people
can
come
onto
the
scene
at
any
time.
the
question
is,
do
we
want
to
increase
that
risk
to
officers?
here,
petitioner
is
leaving,
he'll
be
back
in
a
matter
of
minutes,
and
they're
searching
for
guns.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
sotomayor,
i
completely
agree,
although
i
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--because
we
know
that
some
percentage
of
those
people
will
come
back.
some
percentage
will
flee,
which
is
one
of
the
interests
in
summers,
which
i
think
petitioner
does
not
take
seriously.
but
some
percentage
of
them
will
come
back
and
some
percentage
of
those
returning
occupants
will
harm
officers.
and
unfortunately--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
first,
that
isn't
even
arguably
going
to
serve
two
of
the
three
summers
interests,
preventing
people
from
fleeing
or
garnering
their
assistance
in
the
orderly
completion
of
the
search.
but
even
if
we--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
your
question
fills
in
the
answer.
what
the
court
said
in
summers
is
when
you
see
someone
--
when
you
find
someone
at
a
home
or
you
see
them
leaving
at
a
time
when
a
neutral
magistrate
has
determined
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
is
being
committed
inside,
you
have,
in
the
words
of
the
summers
court,
“
articulable
and
individualized
suspicion
”
to
believe
that
that
person
is
linked
to
the
criminal
activity
inside
the
home.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
justice
kagan,
let
me
break
that
up
into
both
parts.
first,
you
know,
as
far
as
detaining
people
who
have
other
connections
to
the
home,
i
think
you're
right
that
some
of
the
arguments
that
the
court
adopted
in
summers
and
that
the
government
is
making
here
could
translate.
and
i
think
when
those
cases
come
to
the
court,
the
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
to
recognize
doctrines
analogous
to
summers
or
terry
in
those
contexts.
but
that's
not
what
summers
is
about.
the
connection
that
summers
discusses
and
approves
is
seeing
someone
leaving
a
home
subject
to
a
valid
warrant
for
contraband.
that's
the
only
connection
at
issue
here.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
yes,
justice
breyer.
even
petitioner,
the
way
i
read
his
briefs,
concedes
that
if
police
had
caught
him
outside
the
basement
apartment
or
somewhere
within
the
property
bounds--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
breyer,
that
is
absolutely
right.
the
government's
central--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
mean,
i
--
the
government's
central
contention
is
there's
nothing
magical
about
the
gate
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
when
he
steps
through
the
gate,
he's
just
as
much
of
a
flight
risk,
a
danger
to
officers
and
just
as
able
to
assist
in
the
orderly
completion
of
a
search.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
as
soon
as
reasonably
practicable.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
it
is
an
absolute
rule
and
it
tells
you
who,
it
gives
you
a
who,
who
is
detainable.
people
we
find--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
the
who
is
categorical.
people
you
find
on
the
premises
or
you
see
leaving
the
premises
at
a
time
when
a
magistrate
has
determined
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
is
being
committed
inside.
the
where,
the
location.
just
like
duration,
just
like
use
of
force
in
the
muehler
and
rotelli
cases,
those
are
subject
to
the
general
requirement
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
reason
summers
carved
out
the
rule
is
it
said,
look,
for
--
for
current
and
recent
occupants
as
a
class,
we
--
officers
see,
they
find
or
see
them
at
a
residence
where
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
is
committed,
so
across
the
board
we've
got
reasonable
suspicion,
and
that's
why
we
draw
a
rule
so
that
we're
not
going
to
rebalance
every
time.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kagan,
as
far
as
we
know,
george
summers
was
going
to
work.
i
mean,
george
summers
was
detainable,
as
was
petitioner
here,
on
his
view
if
we
had
caught
him
within
the
physical
bounds
of
the
property.
the
question
is
not,
you
know,
how
to
apply
it
in
that
circumstance.
it's
does
something
meaningfully
--
meaningfully
change
when
he
hits
the
sidewalk
or
the
neighbor's
yard?
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
that
explains
why
you
couldn't
let
george
summers
go
on
his
way,
and
it
doesn't
explain
why
the
court
in
summers
didn't
say,
look,
rather
than
roam
the
house,
if
it
really
is
true
that
once
we
let
you
outside
the
front
door
or
the
front
gate,
you
are
no
longer
a
danger
and
are
likely
only
to
be
a
hindrance,
why
not
give
you
the
option
to
leave.
turn
them
out,
because
on
petitioner's
view,
they're
safe
to
go.
and
what
the
court
in
summers
recognized
is,
no,
important
interests
are
served
by
detaining
people
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
mean,
i
think
at
that
point
they
had
probable
cause;
they
could
have
arrested
him
and
i
think
they
could
have
taken
him
down
to
the
station
house.
they
returned
him
to
the
scene
instead.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
in
the
record
about
why
they
took
him
back
to
the
scene
rather
than
--
than
straight
to
the
station
house.
but,
justice
ginsburg,
i
do
want
to
fight
the
premise
a
little
bit.
all
--
all
that
the
government
is
asking
for
is
for
the
court
to
look
through
the
federal
and
state
cases,
because
we
see
the
exact
same
interests
that
were
served
in
summers.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kennedy,
in
that
--
assuming
that's
true,
then
they
took
him
back
to
the
scene
to
complete
the
search,
by
which
time
they
had
found
the
drugs
and
the
guns,
and
then
they
did
arrest
him.
and
he
has
not
claimed
that
at
that
point
there
wasn't
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
but
these
risks
are
real,
and
they
do
play
themselves
out
in
the
cases,
justice
kagan--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--of
course.
a
very
brief
terry
stop
could
allow
a
departing
occupant
to
go
on
his
way
long
before
the
search
is
completed,
and
now
he's
fully
aware
of
the
police
presence.
so
now--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--sure.
okay.
imagine
that--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well,
i
take
one
of
the
differences
between
terry
and
summers
to
be
that
in
terry
the
seizure
is
tied
to
the
officer's
brief
investigation,
and
in
summers
it's
tied
to
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
now,
if
what
you're
talking
about
is
a
terry
stop
that
could
last
for
the
duration
of
the
warrant,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
much
of
a
difference,
then,
between
terry
and
summers.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
because
i
think
the
danger
is
that
courts
will
apply
terry
the
way
that
they
have,
and
we
don't
want
to
dilute
one
doctrine
with
another.
a
brief
terry
stop
could
allow
occupants
to
go
on
their
way,
but
now
they're
aware
of
the
police
presence.
now,
they
are
much
more
of
a
risk
to
flee
or
harm
officers.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
ginsburg,
that's
certainly
true
here.
i
was
only
saying
to
justice
sotomayor,
you
can
imagine
a
case
where
they
execute
the
warrant,
and
it
takes
them
a
while
to
find
something.
and,
in
the
meantime,
they
stop
a
departing
occupant,
he's
not
carrying
a
gun,
he
answers
the
questions
and
does
not
arouse
the
officer's
suspicion,
and
now
he
is
on
his
way.
and
he
is
on
his
way
while
the
search
is
ongoing,
and
now
he
knows
about
it.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
think
the
texas
officers
in
the
valdez
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
briefs,
would
find
it
surprising,
where
they
did
let
someone
go
from
the
scene,
and
she
came
back
with
an
individual
and
started
fighting
with
police.
look,
i
take
petitioner's
point--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--it
is
true
that
only
a
foolhardy
person
would
do
it,
but,
unfortunately,
that
is
a
perfect
description
of
many
criminals
who
do
not
tend
to
be
level-headed,
rational
actors.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia.
and
in
the
mine
run
of
cases,
what
we
know
is
that
these
people
are
leaving
a
home
where
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
a
crime
is
being
committed.
police
are
detaining
them
a
short
distance
away,
and
they
are
doing
it
in
cases
where
people
are
fleeing
or
they
--
we
can
reasonably
believe
they
would
flee
once
they're
seen
officers,
if
they
were
not
detained.
they
are
violent.
they
are
aggressive.
some
number
of
them
can
come
back,
and
we
can
make
reasonable
predictions
about
what
they
would
do,
and
they
provide
very
valuable
assistance.
they
secured
guard
dogs,
like
in
the
head
and
cochran
cases,
where
there
were
pit
bulls
and
dobermans.
they
allow
police
to
--
they
give
them
keys
so
they
don't
have
effect
forceable
entry--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
mean,
i
think
it
is
one
of
three
legitimate
law
enforcement
interests
where
you
have
someone
for
whom
there
is
articulable
and
individualized
suspicion
to
believe
that
they
are
connected
to
criminal
activity.
and
i
think
that
this
court
in
summers
was
absolutely
right.
you
do
find
people
securing
guard
dogs,
moving
families
out
of
harm's
way,
providing
keys
so
that
officers
don't
have
to
break
in
and
harm
property
or
jeopardize
third
parties.
you
find
them
handing
over
contraband
rather
than
endanger
officers.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
well,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--and
the
argument
in
summers
is
you
can
detain
them
because
you've
got
reasonable
suspicion.
the
question
is,
what
are
the
interests
served
by
the
detention?
and
that
is
an
interest
served
by
detention.
now,
we're
not
saying
it's
an
independent
basis
to
support
it.
these
are
people
for
whom,
as
a
class,
there's
reasonable
suspicion,
which
is
why
summers
carved
out
the
rule
that
it
did.
now,
this
--
the
situation
in
this
case
and
the
federal
cases
that
we're
seeing
are
not
meaningfully
distinguishable
from
summers.
you've
got
the
same
reasonable
suspicion,
same
law
enforcement
interests,
same
minimal
intrusion.
there
is
no
--
along
no
dimension
is
there
a
meaningful
difference
between
this
case
and
summers.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
kennedy,
no,
not
under
summers.
now,
whether
they
can--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
when
that
case--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--when
that
case
comes
to
the
court,
the
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
to
recognize
a
doctrine
analogous
to
summers
and
terry.
and
i
will
honestly
admit
that
some
of
the
arguments
that
the
government's
making
here
and
that
the
court
adopted
in
summers
will
translate.
but
summers
is
not
about
that.
summers
is
about
current
and
recent
occupants.
and
those,
as
a
class,
have
reasonable
suspicion.
now,
i
think
these
other
cases
get
harder.
they
will
turn
much
more
on
what
the
connection
was
in
the
facts
of
a
specific
case.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
sotomayor,
to
be
clear,
that's
not
the
government's
rationale.
that's
the
rationale
of
the
court
in
summers.
maybe
the
wife
is
aiding
and
abetting.
we
don't
have
any
idea.
maybe
the
wife,
you
know,
is
implicit
in
the
--
the
husband's
crime
in
some
way.
the
court's
point--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--i--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--my
view
is
with
the
court's
on
summers.
it's
appropriate
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
articulable
and
individualized
suspicion
on
which
the
police
based
the
detention
of
the
occupant
of
a
home
subject
to
a
search
warrant.
and
what
the
court
said
is,
whether
you're
inside
or
whether
you're
on
the
front
steps
or
the
sidewalk,
like
george
summers,
that
reasonable
suspicion
exists.
the
police
have
placed
you
in
the
home
at
a
time
when
a
neutral
magistrate
has
determined
there's
probable
cause.
and
to
be
clear,
we're
not
trying
to
blow
the
doors
off
of
this
exception.
this
is
a
very
narrow
exception.
what
we
see
time
and
again
in
the
federal
cases
is
the
same
fact
pattern:
someone
leaves
the
house;
the
police
catch
up
to
them
within
a
mile,
but
usually
just
within
a
few
blocks;
and,
they
return
them
to
the
scene.
the
police
are
not
treating
this
as
a
sort
of
entitlement.
this
is
not
gant,
where
the
results
are
outstripping
the
rationale.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
justice
scalia,
we're
not
here
asking
for
the
court
to
extend
summers.
we
are
just
asking
for
a
faithful
application
of
what
the
court
said
in
summers.
and
i
understand
that,
you
know,
it
would
seem
troubling
would
--
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
court
in
summers
really
walked
through
why
as
a
class,
when
you're
inside
the
home
or
you're
leaving
the
home,
we've
got
reasonable
suspicion
that
you're
connected,
and
there
are
a
number
of
good
reasons
why
police
can
detain
you
while
they
execute
the
warrant.
you're
right,
the
fourth
amendment
does
require
reasonableness,
and
what
the
officers
did
here
was
eminently
reasonable.
they
are
executing
a
no-knock
warrant
at
a
drug
stash
house
for
a
gun;
they
see
someone
leave
who
fits
the
description
of
the
drug
dealer;
and
rather
than
stop
him
right
on
the
threshold
inside
the
curtilage
and
risk
alarming
his
confederates,
they
let
him
drive
a
short
distance
away
and
they
return
him
to
the
scene.
there's
no
meaningful
difference
between
that
and
if
they
had
stopped
him
right
outside
the
house.
the
only
thing
they
would
have
been--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--it's
far
from
being
fanciful.
the
sherrill
case
out
of
the
eighth
circuit,
the
sears
case
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
they
came
back
and
they
unlocked
doors
so
the
police
wouldn't
have
to
make
forcible
entry.
in
montieth
out
of
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--mr.
chief
justice,
we're
not
here
saying
that
every
time
somebody
could
be
helpful
in
a
search
you
could
go
out
and
detain
them.
it
is
an
exception
to
the
normal
probable
cause
requirement,
but
it's
an
exception
analogous
to
terry
because
you've
got
reasonable
suspicion.
and
the
question
is
there,
okay,
as
a
categorical
rule,
you
know
you've
got
reasonable
suspicion
for
this
entire
group
of
people,
current
and
recent
occupants;
what
reasons
do
police
have
to
detain
them?
and
there
are
really
good
reasons.
one,
they
tend
to
flee.
and
we
see
that
in
cavazos
out
of
the
fifth
circuit.
two,
they
provide
assistance
in
the
search;
and
three,
they
are
often
violent
or
aggressive
individuals.
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant
that
the
vast
majority
of
search
warrants
for
contraband
are
for
guns
and
drugs,
and
you
see
a
number
of
amici
states
in
here
saying:
look,
this
is
a
legitimate
and
important
law
enforcement
practice
for
officers
in
a
very
dangerous
and
volatile
situation
in
executing
these
warrants.
and
i
think
petitioner
takes
those
risks
way
too
lightly,
and
will
not
--
steadfastly
refuses
to
engage
the
realities
on
the
ground
that
we
see
in
the
cases.
judges
and
the
federal
and
state
courts
are
grappling
with
this
every
day,
and
what
these
opinions
reveal
is
that
these
risks
cannot
be
so
easily
dismissed.
they
are
serious
and
they
are
real,
and
we
see
them
play
themselves
out
across
this
entire
set
of
cases.
and
what
we
don't
see
noticeably
is
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
court
tends
to
be
worried
about
in
fourth
amendment
cases:
abuse
and
police
entitlement.
again
and
again,
you
see
police
detaining
departing
occupants
a
very
short
distance
from
a
residence,
returning
them,
not
prolonging
the
detention,
not
engaging
in
exploitative
questioning,
and
actually
serving
the
three
interests
that
the
court
identified
in
summers.
and
to
be
clear,
petitioner's
solution
is
more
than
just
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem;
it
carries
its
own
problem.
it
is
severely
under-inclusive.
it
will
not
capture
any
number
of
cases
where
there
are
valuable
law
enforcement
interests
to
be
served.
and
it
will
produce
very
silly
results
in
a
number
of
cases
where
police
can't
catch
up
to
a
departing
occupant
for
one
reason
or
another
until
after
he's
crossed
some
magical
gate,
and
they
will
have
to
sit
on
their
hands
until
he
returns
so
that
they
can
do
exactly
what
they
would
have
done
minutes
or
hours
earlier
if
they'd
been
able
to
detain
him.
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
they
can,
but,
justice
ginsburg,
tailing
is
a
risky
proposition,
particularly
in
an
urban
area.
and
that
doesn't
even
arguably
begin
to
serve
the
interest
in
avoiding
flight
or
facilitating
efficient
and
orderly--
mr.
jeffrey
b.
wall
--justice
scalia,
if
you
start
from
the
premise
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
permit
this,
then
i
lose.
but
i
think
what
the
court
said
in
summers
is,
what
we
--
this
court
has
already
drawn
a
number
of
exceptions
to
the
probable
cause
requirement
in
reasonable
suspicion
cases.
this
is
another,
and
it
serves
very
valuable
interests
in
this
case
and
others.
