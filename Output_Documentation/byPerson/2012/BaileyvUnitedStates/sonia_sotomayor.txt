justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
two
tests,
yours
seem
to
be
the
immediate
vicinity
test,
and
the
second
circuit
is
as
soon
as
practical
test.
your
adversaries
point
out
that
the
second
circuit
test
actually
focuses
on
the
police
officer's
conduct,
which
should
be
the
focus
of
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness.
your
test
just
creates
an
artificial
line
that
is
subject
to
as
much
play
as
the
other.
why
isn't
the
focus
on
police
conduct
the
right
focus?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
can
i
come
back
to
the
facts
that
my
colleagues
have
raised
and
break
it
down
implicating
the
terry
question?
here,
the
officers
had
a
report
of
something
in
the
house,
and
they
saw
the
defendant
--
two
people
leaving.
i
know
terry
hasn't
been
decided,
but
why
do
you
think
--
just
the
stop,
not
the
detention,
not
the
bringing
them
back
to
the
house,
why
do
you
think
that
just
stopping
them
was
wrong?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
terry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
court
below
did.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
goes
back
to
if
a
police
officer
saw
an
individual
leaving
the
house
and
was
concerned
about
them
tipping
someone
off,
et
cetera,
what
would
be
the
problem
with
the
officer
stopping
the
person
around
the
corner,
holding
them,
making
sure
people
got
in
and
then
letting
them
go.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
your
better
answer
was
the
risk
of
somebody
coming
back
to
a
house
exists
whether
the
person
just
left
it
or
left
it
an
hour
after
or
before
or
2
hours
or
24.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
the
police
walk
in,
they
always
have
to
guard
against
reentry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
wall,
would
you
answer
--
direct
your
first
response
to
that
last
issue
because,
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
seem
not
to
be
accepting
the
second
circuit's
rule
at
all.
you
seem
to
be
proposing
what
appears
to
me
to
be
a
much
broader
rule
that
says
--
at
one
point
in
your
brief
you
state
that
it
is
the
occupant's
observed
connection
to
a
home
subject
to
a
valid
warrant,
not
his
physical
location
at
the
time
that
he
is
detained,
that
makes
him
subject
to
detention.
now,
i
know
police
when
they're
executing
warrants
often
have
an
advance
team
that
has
been
surveilling
a
home,
sometimes
for
days.
and
they've
got
one
officer
sitting
there,
and
they
see
who
they
think
is
the
occupant
leave,
and
the
team
doesn't
arrive
till
12
hours
later.
is
it
your
position
that
in
that
circumstance
the
officers
are
authorized
to
go
to
wherever
the
defend
--
wherever
the
occupant
is,
the
office,
the
--
wherever
he
might
be,
his
mother's
home,
and
effect
an
arrest
there?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
missing
the
point,
which
is
that's
going
to
happen
regardless,
meaning
that
risk
exists
whether
the
person
left
the
minute
you
got
there
or
a
minute
before
or
an
hour
before
or
two
hours
before.
that's
the
whole
point,
which
is
the
risk
is
extant
no
matter
what.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
didn't
know
--
you
don't
know
that
in
any
search,
meaning
any
time
you
do
a
search
you
have
no
idea
when
the
--
whether
the
occupant
--
sometimes
you
know
whether
the
occupant
is
inside.
you'll
hear
the
tv
or
something
else.
but
often
you
don't,
and
you
don't
know
if
someone
will
come
back
and
when.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
is
seeing
someone
leaving
increasing
that
risk?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
what
constitutional
right
entitles
you
to
stop
someone
from,
using
the
word,
“
fleeing
”?
you
certainly
are
entitled
to
stop
someone
with
whom
you
have
reasonable
suspicion.
but
what
constitutional
right
entitles
you
to
stop
a
person
who's
just
leaving
in
the
normal
act,
without
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
the
problem
with
absolute
rules
like
we
did
in
summers
is
that
they're
an
exception,
and
they're
absolute.
go
back
to
the
question
you
were
asked
by
one
of
my
colleagues
earlier,
why
wouldn't
terry
give
you
all
of
the
rights
that
you're
seeking
on
the
absolute
rule,
but
subject
your
police
conduct
to
the
question
of
reasonableness,
which
is
the
normal
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
i'm
litigating
for
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
could
very
easily
imagine
that
what
the
fight's
going
to
be
like
below
is,
we
stopped
them
because
we
saw
them
coming
out
of
the
house,
and
all
we
want
to
do
is
make
sure
that
they
don't
return.
so
we're
just
going
to
hold
them
in
place.
we
don't
have
to
drag
them
in
a
car
back
to
a
place
they
just
left.
we're
just
going
to
stop
them
in
place
to
get
a
phone
call
that
everything's
all
clear.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
we
don't
know,
but
why
don't
we
let
that
develop.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
my
--
i
remain
with
my
question,
which
is,
we
have
a
circumstance-driven
power
of
terry.
your
power
is
really
going
much
more
broadly,
because
you're
basically
saying
if
that
--
if
probable
cause
exists
to
search
a
premise,
it
exists
without
being
tied
to
an
individual
because
anybody
who
leaves
the
house,
whether
or
not
they
have
been
tied
to
a
crime
in
that
house
in
the
past
or
not,
is
now
subject
to
being
detained.
so
we
have
evidence
that
only
a
husband
is
involved
in
a
fraud,
and
his
wife
is
leaving
for
work.
because
she
was
observed
leaving
the
house,
she
can
now
be
stopped
a
mile
away.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
your
--
your
view
is
that
summers
gave
you
--
entitled
you
to
hold
people
merely
for
purposes
of
investigation--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--without
any
reasonable
suspicion?
that's
really
what
your
rule
is
saying.
