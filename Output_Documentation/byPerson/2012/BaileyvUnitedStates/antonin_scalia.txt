justice
antonin
scalia
may
be?
there
certainly
is.
i
mean,
that
was
summers,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
he
wasn't
on
the
premises,
he
was
on
the
sidewalk,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
in
the
curtilage
of
the
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
just
the
stop
would
be
--
but
--
but
they
did
more
than
just
stop
them.
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
handcuffed
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shanmugam,
please
help
me.
i
--
i
don't
understand
why
--
why
the
terry
stop
is
at
issue,
inasmuch
as
there
was
not
a
terry
stop.
i
mean,
what
occurred
here
went
well
beyond
a
terry
stop,
did
it
not?
so
what
do
you
do?
you
--
you
slice
the
baloney
that
thin;
you
say
well,
the
--
the
first
stop
is
a
terry
stop.
oh,
yes,
he
later
went
on
to
detain
them
for
a
long
time
and
put
handcuffs
on
them
and
take
them
back
to
the
premises.
what
--
what
relevance
does
the
terry
stop
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
--
i
guess,
i
didn't
realize
that
it's
an
open
question
whether
you
can
do
that
much
in
--
in
a
mere
terry
stop.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
physical
bounds
of
the
property
is
--
is
too
much.
i
mean,
you
know,
what
if
it's
a
farm
and
it's
a
50-acre
farm?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
are
much
better
off,
i
think
your
submissions
sometimes
say
immediate
vicinity.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
that
much
better
than
boundaries
of
the
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
that
they
can't
stop
them
from
leaving.
have
you
said
that;
they
can't
stop
them
from
leaving?
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
anybody
coming
back
to
the
house,
not
just
the
person
who
just
left.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
surely
the
police,
when
they're
conducting
a
search,
post
guards
to
prevent
people
from
coming
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
they
always
do.
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
special
threat
from
the
person
who
--
who
left
the
house.
there's
always
a
threat
of
somebody
else
coming
into
the
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
you
have
a
large
enough
force
that
you
can
afford
to
send
two
of
them
in
a
car
chasing
this
fellow
for
a
mile,
why
can't
you
just
post
those
two
outside
the
house,
just
in
case
somebody,
whether
it's
this
person
who's
just
left
or
anybody
else,
comes
back?
i
mean,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
what
your
positing
is
--
is
--
is
unlikely,
namely,
having
--
having
sufficient
personnel
to
follow
these
persons,
but
not
having
sufficient
personnel
to
defend
the
premises
against
somebody
entering.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
something
magical
about
the
gate
or
at
least
about
the
immediate
facility
of
the
house.
what
we're
trying
to
apply
here
is
an
absolute
rule
to
make
it
unnecessary
for
the
officers
to
guess
whether
they
can
do
this
or
that.
and
the
rule
you
propose
is,
well,
you
know,
a
mile
away.
what's
your
test,
a
reasonable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
soon
as
reasonably
practicable.
you
consider
that
an
absolute
test?
i
thought
that
the
test
we
invented
here
was
meant
to
help
officers,
to
say
this
is
the
rule
and
you
can
do
it.
and
you
want
to
do
anything
else,
use
terry
or
use
--
use
normal
probable
cause
principles,
but
this
is
an
absolute
rule
governing
the
--
the
search
of
a
home.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
give
you
a
where.
you
need
more
than
a
who.
you
need
a
who
and
a
where.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what?
what's
he
going
to
--
he's
going
to
phone
them
and
say,
hey,
you
know,
you're
going
to
be
searched.
the
cops
are
crawling
all
around
the
house
already.
so
the
only
realistic
additional
threat
is
that
he
is
going
to
voluntarily
go
back
to
where
the
police
are
in
the
house?
i
mean,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
so
implausible.
what
--
what
harm--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
threat
to
the
policemen
can
possibly
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
very
unusual.
justice
antonin
scalia
very
unusual.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
adopt
absolute
rules
to
cover
foolhardy
people.
i
mean,
we
--
absolute
rules
are
designed
to
cover
the
mine
run
of
cases,
the
generality
of
cases,
not
the
oddball
case.
that's
not
what
you
use
an
absolute
rule
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the
procedure
has
to
be
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
right?
now
--
now,
the
requirements
for
a
warrant
are
not
the
outer
bounds
of
--
of
what's
reasonable,
but
nonetheless,
what
--
it
seems
to
me
that
what's
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
can
be
estimated
from
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
warrant
to
contain,
and
what
a
warrant
must
contain
is
a
description
of
the
place
to
be
searched,
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
and
what
you're
arguing
for
is
a
special
rule
which
says
once
you
have
a
warrant
that
this
place
can
be
searched,
you
can
seize
anybody
--
you
can
seize
not
only
anybody
there
in
order
to
protect
the
police,
but
anybody
connected
with
the
--
with
the
place.
and
that
--
that
is
so
contrary
to
what
seems
to
me
the
theory
of
--
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
i
am
very
reluctant
to
--
to
extend
our
cases
any
further
than
they
already
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
might
have
wanted
to
help
in
the
search.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
law
enforcement
would
be
a
lot
easier
if
we
didn't
have
the
doggone
fourth
amendment.
i
mean,
the
fourth
amendment
is
an
impediment
to
law
enforcement.
of
course
it
is.
there
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
say
there
was
a
historical
basis
for
the
rule,
in
that
officers
have
always
been
allowed
to
take
necessary
action
to
protect
themselves.
and
that's
the
principal
justification.
