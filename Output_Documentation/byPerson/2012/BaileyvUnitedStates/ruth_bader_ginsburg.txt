but
terry
--
terry
is
an
open
question
in
this
case.
it
wasn't
decided
below,
but
it
was
raised.
so
--
so
you're
arguing
we
shouldn't
extend
summers,
but
that
leaves
this
very
case
susceptible
to
the
assertion
that
this
was
a
legitimate
terry
stop.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
did
do
--
if
they
did
do
a
terry
stop,
and
in
the
process
of
that
stop
the
police
officer
got
a
call
that
said,
we
found
lots
of
contraband,
guns
in
this
house,
at
that
point
they
could
have
turned
the
terry
stop
into
an
arrest,
couldn't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
he
came
back
--
i
mean,
the
scenario
here
is
he
was
supposed
to
be
driving
his
friend
home,
and
he
would
have
come
back
while
the
search
was
ongoing,
but
the
police
could
apprehend
anyone
while
the
search
--
if
that's
what
you're
saying,
while
the
search
is
ongoing--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
mr.
shanmugam
says
they
could
stop
him.
they
could
stop
anybody.
the
search
is
ongoing.
somebody
approaches
the
house;
the
police
can
stop
that
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
wall,
the
summers
case
was
an
exception.
the
main
rule
is
you
would
have
probable
cause.
so
you
are
taking
the
exception,
which
was
tied
tightly
to
the
house.
you
want
him
to
stay
on
the
premises
so
he
can
--
there
won't
be
any
risk
that
he's
going
to
disrupt
the
search,
but
it
was
--
it
was
an
exception
to
the
main
fourth
amendment
rule,
and
now
you
are
asking
to
have
that
exception
spread.
and
so
today
you
say,
oh,
well,
we're
not
--
we're
not
asking
if
the
person
gets
to
her
workplace,
but
that
the
police,
but
maybe
why
--
why
not?
i
mean,
you
--
it's
one
thing
to
confine
summers
to
the
house,
the
immediate
premises,
and
another
to
say
seven-tenths
of
a
mile
away,
that's
okay,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
have
to
draw
a
line
someplace.
when
he
is
descending
the
steps
to
his
house,
he
is
still
associated
with
the
house.
and
once
he
steps
over
that
line,
the
summers
rationale
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
apply.
but
there's
a
curiosity
about
this
case,
maybe
you
can
explain
it
to
me.
they
stop
him
seven-tenths
of
a
mile
away.
by
that
time,
the
search
is
ongoing.
they
have
found
guns
and
contraband.
they
take
--
why
do
they
take
him
back
to
the
house?
what
was
the
reason
for
taking?
there
was
nothing
there
that
he
could
--
he
couldn't
obstruct
the
search.
he
was
in
handcuffs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
couldn't
point
out
anything
in
drawers
because
they'd
found
it
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
explain
--
explain
to
me
--
the
police,
they
have
the
informant's
tip,
and
they
see
them
coming
out
of
the
house.
so
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
good
case
that
that
would
be
reasonable
suspicion.
coming
out
of
the
house,
he
looks
like
what
the
informant
says.
then
they
--
can
they
--
they
pat
him
down
and
they
find
his
keys,
and
the
keys
are
to
the
house.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case,
you
couldn't
think
of
a
reason
why
they
took
him
back
to
the
scene.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
could
follow
him.
