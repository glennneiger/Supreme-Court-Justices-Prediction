chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-770,
chunon
bailey
v.
united
states.
mr.
shanmugam.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
say
the
difference
is
there's
no
immediate
threat
to
the
officers
here.
but
there
is
a
threat,
i
suppose,
i
mean,
if
he
finds
out
about
the
search
and
comes
back,
if
he
sees
the
officers
outside
his
dwelling,
if
there's
somebody
in
the
dwelling
who
can
notify
him,
send
him
a
message
that
the
police
are
searching
and
he
can
get
his
confederates
and
come
back.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
requiring
that
there
be
a
larger
number
of
police
present
at
the
site
conducting
the
search,
being
lookouts
for
anybody
that
might
come
back,
being
able
to
detain
people
who
are
leaving
as
they
approach.
there's
no
immediate
threat,
but
there's
certainly
a
threat.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
requires
more
unless
they
want
the
guy
to
get
away,
i
guess,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
talked
about
--
we
talked
about
officer
safety.
what
about
the
safety
of
others?
suppose
the
place
being
searched
is
adjacent
to
a
playground
and
there
are,
you
know,
dozens
of
children
playing
in
the
playground.
the
police
are
worried
there
would
be
a
shootout
and
they
want
to
detain
the
person,
so
they
say:
well,
let's
wait
until
he
gets
a
block
down
the
street
and
detain
him
there
for
the
safety
of
the
kids.
that
has
--
they
can't
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
the
precaution
is
let's
wait
until
he's
a
block
down
the
street
because
it
will
be
a
lot
safer.
can
they
do
that
and
be
covered
by
summers
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wall.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
in
this
case.
we
have
them
getting
into
a
car,
driving
almost
a
mile
away
and
being
stopped
at
that
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
they're
executing
the
warrant,
i
don't
remember,
was
the
--
did
the
individual
know
that
they
were
executing
the
warrant
in
this
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
danger
to
them
is
not
at
all
like
the
situation
with
the
dog
and
the
armed
guy
just
off
of
the
property.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
argument
in
summers
i
just
don't
understand.
the
argument
is
you
can
detain
the
people
because
they
might
want
to
give
the
officers
assistance.
well,
if
they
want
to
give
them
assistance,
they
don't
have
to
be
detained.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
odd,
you
know,
we're
going
to
tie
--
we're
not
going
to
tie
you
up
--
we're
going
to
keep
you
here,
you
can't
leave
because
we
think
you
might
tell
us
where
the
drugs
are.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
they
want
to
do
that,
they
can.
the
question
is
whether
you
can
detain
them
in
the
hope
that
they
will
decide
to
help
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
give
you
the
key
to
the
cabinet.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
the
question
is
whether
you
have
to
detain
them
to
do
something
you're
saying
they'd
want
to
do.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shanmugam,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-770,
bailey
versus
united
states.
