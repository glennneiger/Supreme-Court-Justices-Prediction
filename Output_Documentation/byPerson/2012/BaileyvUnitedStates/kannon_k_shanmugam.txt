mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,--
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
michigan
v.
summers,
this
court
established
a
categorical
exception
to
the
default
fourth
amendment
requirement
of
probable
cause.
under
summers,
officers
executing
a
search
warrant
for
contraband
may
detain
individuals
they
encounter
at
the
scene
while
they
are
in
the
course
of
executing
the
warrant.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
summers
exception
also
permits
officers
to
detain
individuals
who
have
left
the
scene
before
the
warrant
is
executed.
because
individuals
who
have
left
the
scene
do
not
pose
an
immediate
threat
to
the
safe
and
efficient
completion
of
the
search,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
by
permitting
their
detention
absent
probable
cause
or
even
individualized
suspicion.
its
judgment
should
therefore
be
reversed.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
let
me
explain,
justice
sotomayor,
first,
the
sort
of
theoretical
basis
for
why
we're
offering
this
line,
and,
second,
say
a
word
about
the
comparative
merits
of
the
two
tests.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
theoretical
basis
for
the
line,
our
fundamental
submission
to
this
court
is
that
summers
does
not
create
a
police
entitlement;
it
is
instead
a
rule
of
necessity
and
should
be
confined
to
situations
in
which
a
detention
serves
search-related
purposes.
and
in
our
view,
the
justifications
for
a
detention
evaporate
once
an
individual
has
left
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
premises.
and,
again,
that's
because
in
those
circumstances
a
detention
serves
no
interest
in
ensuring
the
safe
and
efficient
completion
of
the
search
because
the
individual
poses
no
immediate
threat
to
the
safe
and
efficient
completion
of
the
search.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
ordinarily,
the
immediate
vicinity
will
be
the
physical
bounds
of
the
property;
but,
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
an
individual
who
is
just
outside
the
physical
bounds
of
the
property
should
nevertheless
be
detained,
so
to
provide--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
in
summers
itself,
the
individual
was
on
the
premises
just
outside
the
house
that
was
going
to
be
searched,
and
the
officers
were,
in
the
government's
words
in
that
case,
approaching
the
property.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
he
was
actually
on
--
he
was
on
the
property
because
he
was
on
a
sidewalk
that
connected
the
front
steps
to
the
public
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
house.
the
officers
were
approaching
the
house,
about
to
effectuate
entry.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
he
was
pretty
clearly
within
the
curtilage,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
if
anything,
it's
the
government's
approach
that
requires
a
greater
number
of
officers
at
the
site
because,
under
the
government's
approach,
you
have
the
two
officers
who
conduct
the
detention
while
a
separate
group
of
officers
execute
the
search.
and
it's
really
for
that
reason,
justice
scalia--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
let
me
say
something
about
this
prospect
that
the
individual
will
return.
we
think
that
the
appropriate
analysis
here
is
the
analysis
that
this
court
set
out
in
arizona
v.
gant.
and
this
court,
in
arizona
v.
gant,
suggested
that
where
a
categorical
rule
is
involved,
you
have
to
look
at
the
class
of
cases
to
which
the
rule
would
be
extended
to
see
if
the
justifications
apply.
now,
with
regard
to
this
class
of
individuals
who
have
left
the
scene,
we
believe
that
it
is
simply
unlikely
either
that
such
an
individual
who
has
left
the
scene
will
be
aware
of
the
presence
of
police,
or
that
such
an
individual
will
return
in
an
effort
to
disrupt
the
search.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
we
wouldn't.
and
that's
simply
because
we
believe
that
this
should
be
a
categorical
analysis.
so,
again,
you're
looking
at
this
entire
class
of
cases
where
individuals
have
left
the
scene
to
determine
whether
the
justifications
for
the
summers
rule
apply.
now,
let
me
provide
a--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
the
analysis
under
terry
is
whether
there
is
reasonable
suspicion,
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
the
individual
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
ordinarily,
when
an
individual
is
seen
leaving
the
scene
--
and
suppose
--
let
me
provide--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
of
course,
the
individual
who
is
leaving
the
scene
doesn't
necessarily
know
that
the
search
is
about
to
take
place.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
and
so,
to
provide
a
hypothetical
that
will
hopefully
put
some
meat
on
the
bones
of
this
issue,
suppose
that
an
individual
leaves
a
house,
and
he
actually
sees
police
officers
sitting
in
a
car,
whether
marked
or
unmarked,
outside
the
house.
and
it
is
clear
that
he
has
seen
the
officers.
he
waves
at
the
officers
and
then
ambles
down
the
street.
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
doubt
but
that
that
individual
could
not
be
detained
unless
he
did
something
more;
unless,
for
instance,
he
engaged
in
flight
at
that
point,
at
which
point
he
could
perhaps
be
detained
under
terry.
and
so
we
simply
submit
that
the
analysis
should
be
no
different
in
a
situation
in
which
the
purpose
--
the
reason
why
the
officers
are
sitting
outside
the
house
is
because
another
group
of
officers
is
about
to
execute
the
search
warrant.
of
course,
that
individual--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
and
just
to
be
clear
about
how
these
two
doctrines
work
together,
our
submission
to
this
court
is
that
within
the
search
zone,
within
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
premises,
the
rule
of
summers
applies,
so
that,
if
officers
encounter
an
individual
within
that
zone
while
they
are
in
the
process
of
executing
the
warrant,
a
detention
is
permissible
absent
probable
cause
or
individualized
suspicion.
outside
that
search
zone,
ordinary
fourth
amendment
principles
apply.
and,
of
course,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
detentions
of
persons
have
to
be
justified
by
some
degree
of
individualized
suspicion;
probable
cause
for
a
full-fledged
arrest,
individualized
suspicion
for
a
more
limited
detention
under
terry.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
justifications
articulated
by
this
court
in
summers,
justice
alito,
and
in
particular
what
we
really
believe
are
the
primary
justifications,
first,
minimizing
the
risk
of
harm
to
officers
executing
the
warrant;
and,
second,
facilitating
the
orderly
completion
of
the
search.
and
let
me
say
a
word
about--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--but
they
also
have
the
choice
not
to
engage
in
a
detention
at
all.
and
i
think
the
fundamental
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals'
rule
and
with
the
government's
submission
to
this
court
is
that
it
really
entails
the
conclusion
that
once
officers
see
the
individual
leaving
the
house,
they
have
an
entitlement
to
detain
that
individual,
with
the
only
open
question
being
where
and
how
they
go
about
effectuating
the
detention.
but
we
simply
believe
that
the
justifications
for
the
detention
don't
attach
to
the
individual.
they
are
search-based
justifications.
and
the
mere
fact
that
an
individual
is
seen
leaving
a
house
that
is
about
to
be
searched
in
our
view
is
insufficient
to
give
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
we
simply
think,
justice
kagan,
that
that
justification
is
insufficient
standing
on
its
own.
and
that
is
simply
because
the
justification
in
preventing
flight
is
different
in
kind
from
the
other
two
justifications
that
we've
been
discussing.
the
other
two
justifications
are
truly
special
law
enforcement
interests,
to
use
this
court's
words
in
summers.
the
interest
in
preventing
flight,
by
contrast,
is
an
ordinary
law
enforcement
interest.
and
just
as
in
my
hypothetical,
when
the
officers
are
sitting
outside
and
they
see
an
individual
wander
by,
the
mere
fact
that
the
individual
saw
the
police
and
perhaps
would
therefore
conclude
that
the
police
were
on
to
him
would
not
give
rise
to
a
basis
for
detention
simply
because
that
individual
could
subsequently
flee.
so,
too,
we
think
that
preventing
flight
in
and
of
itself
is
insufficient.
that
is
the
ordinary
law
enforcement
interest
that
requires
individualized
suspicion.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
under
terry?
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
sure.
well,
and
first
of
all,
i
should
preface
what
i'm
about
to
say
by
noting
that
the
court
of
appeals
itself
didn't
reach
the
terry
issue,
and
the
government
doesn't
advance
that
issue
in
its
merits
brief.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
so
that
would
be
an
issue
that
would
be
open
on
remand.
and
let
me
say
why
on
remand--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
that's
right.
the
stop
and
the--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--and
just
to
be
clear,
because
there
are
the
two
separate
issues.
there's
the
question
of
the
stop
and
the
question
of
the
detention.
there
would
be
a
separate
question
about
whether
under
terry
a
detention
of
a
particular
length
might
or
might
not
be
permissible.
but
as
to
the
stop,
the
argument
that
we
would
make
on
remand
if
we
were
to
prevail
before
this
court
would
be
that
here
what
you
have
is
insufficient
to
meet
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard.
and
what
i
assume
that
the
government
would
argue
is
that
the
combination
of
the
search
warrant
and
the
fact
that
the
individual
was
seen
leaving
the
premises
that
were
about
to
be
searched,
and
as
to
which
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
was
present,
and
the
fact
that
my
client
met
the
extremely
generic
description
provided
by
the
confidential
informant,
would
be
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion.
now,
clearly
we
don't
think
--
i
was
just
going
to
say,
clearly
we
don't
think
that
either
of
those
factors
standing
on
its
own
would
be
sufficient.
the
question
would
be
whether
that
combination
of
factors
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case
would
be
sufficient,
and
we
would
submit
that
that
combination
is
insufficient
as
well.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
they
could
very
well,
with
one
caveat,
and
that
caveat
is
simply
that
the
circumstances
under
which
the
contraband
is
found
might
be
relevant
to
the
analysis
of
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause,
because
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
individual
constructively
possessed
the
contraband
at
issue.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
that
would
be
the
additional
question,
whether
the
detention
in
this
case,
which
did
involve
taking
my
client
and
the
other
individual,
putting
them
in
handcuffs,
putting
them
in
the
patrol
car,
and
then
taking
them
back
to
the
scene,
was
permissible
within
the
scope
of
a
terry
stop.
and
i
think
that
would
also
be
an
open
question,
and
that
would
particularly
be
an
open
question
in
a
number
of
these
cases
in
which
the
detention,
pursuant
seemingly
to
summers,
occurs
over
a
very
lengthy
period
of
time.
under
terry,
of
course--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
under
terry
officers
may
detain
an
individual
for
the
period
of
time
it
takes
for
them
to
confirm
or
dispel
the
suspicion,
and
i
think
that
there
would
be
an
open
question
as
to
whether
or
not
when
officers
are
executing
a
search
warrant,
for
the
duration
of
the
execution
of
the
search
warrant,
that
falls
within
the
scope
of
that
terry
test.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
ordinarily
it
will
be
within
the
physical
bounds
of
the
property.
so
--
but
--
but
if,
for
instance,
officers
saw
an
individual
coming
out
of
his
house
and
he
walked
out
and
he
just
happened
to
step
--
step
off
the
curb
into
the
road
before
the
officers
got
to
them,
we
would
say
that
that
would
satisfy
the
immediate
vicinity
standard.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
and
the
point
of--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
we
--
we
proposed
to
this
court
the
immediate
vicinity
standard
in
large
part
because
it
really
is
comparable
to
similar
limits
this
court
has
adopted
for
other
fourth
amendment--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well
--
and
to
provide
a
couple
of
examples,
under
maryland
v.
buie,
the
case
that
permits
officers
to
conduct
a
protective
sweep
incident
to
an
arrest,
the
court
permits
officers
to
search
the
area
immediately
adjoining
the
place
where
the
arrest
occurs
and
that
has
not
proven
to
be
a
difficult
standard
to
apply
in
practice.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well
--
well,
let
me--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--let
me
address
each
of
those
three.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
i
actually
don't
think
that
even
the
first
one
is
identical.
but
look,
we
think
that
first
and
foremost,
the
interest
in
ensuring
officer
safety
is
really
the
paramount
interest
here,
and
we
simply
think
that
it
is
unlikely
that
an
individual
who
is
seen
leaving
the
scene
is
either
going
to
be
aware
of
the
presence
of
police
or
return
to
disrupt
the
search.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
government
has
not
identified
a
single
example
of
an
individual
who
is
seen
leaving
the
scene
who
has
returned
to
disrupt
the
search
in
that
fashion.
indeed,
the
government
makes
a
much--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
and
that
was
going
to
be--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
and
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
point,
justice
sotomayor;
and
the
government
really
tries
to
make
a
broader
and
more
ambitious
argument.
the
government
tries
to
make
the
argument
that
an
individual
with
a
connection
to
the
place
to
be
searched
could
arrive
at
the
scene
while
the
search
is
ongoing,
really
regardless
of
whether
that
individual
was
aware
of
the
presence
of
police,
and
then
seek
to
disrupt
the
search.
now,
we
think
even
as
to
that
broader
category
of
cases
the
government
hasn't
made
a
sufficient
showing
that
those
sorts
of
confrontations
are
a
common
occurrence,
particularly
in
light
of
the
routine
precautions--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
haven't
personally
conducted
any
searches,
justice
breyer.
but
i
can
say
that
with
regard
to
categorical
rules
it
is
really
incumbent
on
the
government
to
make
a
showing
as
to
why
an
extension
of
a
categorical
rule
is
required.
because
after
all--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--officers
will
naturally
take
precautions
in
situations
like
that.
they
will
go
in
with--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--they
cannot
be
covered
by
summers,
but
what
they
can
do
is
either
follow
the
individual
for
the
period
of
time
during
which
they
are
executing
the
warrant,
or
they
can
detain
that
individual
if
he
returns
to
the
scene.
and
again,
all
of
the
examples
that
the
government
cites
--
and
there
aren't
that
many
of
them
--
but
the
examples
that
the
government
cites
are
examples
of
individuals
who
arrive
at
the
scene
and
when
they
realize
that
their
place
of
residence
is
being
searched,
they
become
obstreperous;
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
concern
about
the
threat
posed
to
the
safety
of
officers
in
those
circumstances,
we
would
submit
that
the
obvious
solution
is
to
make
clear
that
summers
permits
the
detention
of
individuals
who
arrive
at
the
scene;
and
officers
routinely
do
establish
perimeters
when
they
are
executing
search
warrants.
and
so
when
they--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
if
he
were
to
return
to
the
scene
while
the
search
is
ongoing,
we
believe
that
he
could
be
detained
pursuant
to
summers,
and
we
cite
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
cases
that
have
so
held.
what
the
government
is
really
arguing
for
here
is
an
even
more
ambitious
rule,
an
additional
layer
of
fourth
amendment
prophylaxis,
if
you
will,
that
permits
officers
to
detain
an
individual
who
is
seen
leaving
the
scene
based
on
the
possibility
that
they
are
going
to
return.
the
government
has
not
come
even
close
to
making
an
empirical
case
as
to
why
that
additional
layer
of
prophylaxis
is
required.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
i
think
that
the
natural
limit
on
the
immediate
vicinity
rule
is
imposed
by
the
underlying
justification,
namely,
that
officers
should
have
the
authority
to
encounter
individuals
--
to
detain
individuals
they
encounter
while
they
are
in
the
course
of
executing
the
warrant.
and
so
if
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
alito,
the
search
team
is
marching
up
to
the
house,
and
they
encounter
the
individual
50
feet
away
from
the
door
or
the
property
line
while
they
are
in
the
course
of
doing
so,
the
justifications
of
summers
kick
in
at
that
point.
that
individual
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
police
are
about
to
search
his
house,
and,
as
such,
that
individual
poses
a
threat
to
the
safe
and
efficient
completion
of
the
search.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
we
don't
think--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--we
don't
think
that
that's
necessarily
a
line
of
sight
rule.
so
if
you
had
an
individual
who
was
sitting
out
in
front
of
a
house
six
doors
down,
we
don't
think
that
that
individual
could
be
detained.
of
course,
in
this
case,
my
client
was
detained
at
least
seven-tenths
of
a
mile
away--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--so
the
issue--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--you're
missing
the--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--they
--
they
could
always
proceed
to
execute
the
warrant
when
they
see
an
individual
leaving;
and,
if
they
are
in
the
course
of
executing
the
warrant,
a
detention
is
permissible.
but
let
me
say
just
one
word
about
the
issue
of
the
administrability
of
the
rule
because,
after
all,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
bright-line
rule.
and
the
very
purpose
of
a
fourth
amendment
bright-line
rule
is
to
provide
guidance
to
courts
and
officers
alike.
it
is
true
that
one
can
posit
difficult
hypotheticals
under
our
immediate
vicinity
standard;
but,
it
is
also
true
that
it
is
even
easier
to
posit
difficult
hypotheticals
under
the
as
soon
as
reasonably
practicable
standard
that
the
government
advances,
which
really
reintroduces
the
very
case-by-case
analysis
that
bright-line
rules
are
designed
to
avoid.
and,
in
addition,
it
is
entirely
unclear
to
us
what
fourth
amendment
purpose
that
limitation
serves
because
it
is
not
clear
to
us
why
it
matters
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
how
quickly
officers
effectuate
the
detention.
and
just
one
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
before
reserving
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
the
rule
that
the
government
seems
to
be
advocating
before
this
court
is
really
a
much
more
ambitious
rule
than
we've
even
been
discussing
this
morning.
the
government
seems
to
suggest
that
the
government
has
the
authority
to
detain
any
individual
with
a
connection
to
the
place
to
be
searched.
and
i
think
that
that
is
out
of
recognition
that
an
individual
who
happens
to
be
at
their
workplace
could
just
as
easily
return
to
the
place
to
be
searched
as
an
individual
who
is
seen
leaving.
in
our
view,
that
is
an
astonishing
extension
of
the
rule
that
this
court
announced
in
summers.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
--
just
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
having
suggested
in
its
brief
that
the
police
may
detain
any
individual
with
a
connection
to
the
place
to
be
searched
under
summers,
the
government
today
falls
back
to
the
view
that
the
police
may
detain
any
individual
with
an
observed
connection,
suggesting
that
this
court
can
leave
for
another
day
the
question
of
whether
to
detain
people
with
a
certain
but
non-observed
connection.
leaving
that
aside,
the
government
suggests
on
at
least
five
occasions
today
that
that
observed
connection
is
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion.
that
was
not
the
basis
on
which
this
court
adopted
its
categorical
rule
in
summers.
if
it
had
been,
the
discussion
of
the
special
law
enforcement
interests
supporting
the
rule
would
have
been
entirely
superfluous.
and
it's
for
that
reason
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
made
clear
in
footnote
19
that
summers
permits
officers
to
detain
individuals
regardless
of
the
quantum
of
proof
justifying
the
detention
of
specific
individuals.
and
this
court's
subsequent
cases
applying
summers
have
made
clear
that
summers
permits
the
detention
of
individuals
with
no
apparent
connection
to
the
criminal
activity
being
investigated.
and
that
leads
into
my
second
point,
which
is
that
terry
will
serve
as
a
fallback
in
many
of
these
cases
to
permit
detentions
of
individuals
who
are
seen
leaving
the
premises,
where
there
is
a
sufficient
additional
basis
to
give
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion.
in
fact,
it
may
very
well
be
the
exception
to
the
rule
that
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
aren't
sufficient
additional
articulable
facts
to
give
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
case
falls
within
that
exceptional
category,
but
it
really
underscores
why
the
expansion
of
summers
that
the
government
is
seeking
is
really
unnecessary.
i
would
just
note,
in
response
to
a
point
that
justice
scalia
made,
that
the
fundamental
flaw
with
the
government's
position
is
that
it
really
can't
be
reconciled
with
any
original
understanding
of
the
fourth
amendment.
there's
no
historical
evidence
suggesting
that
officers
at
the
time
of
the
founding
or
thereafter,
when
executing
search
warrants,
detained
the
occupants
of
the
premises.
and
the
problem
with
the
government's
approach
is
that
it
really
would
convert
any
search
warrant
into
a
search
and
seizure
warrant.
it
would
really
would
suggest
that
there
is
a
freestanding
right
to
detain
anyone
with
a
connection
or
an
observed
connection
to
the
place
to
be
searched
that
operates
alongside
the
warrant-conferred
right
to
conduct
the
search.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
no,
we
wouldn't,
justice
alito.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we're
not
challenging
the
rule
of
summers
itself.
we're
simply
suggesting
that
there's
no
historical
basis
for
that
rule,
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
any
expansion
of
summers
would
really
be
of
questionable
validity.
in
summers
itself,
the
detention
was
truly
incident
to
the
execution
of
the
warrant
because,
after
all,
the
officers
were
approaching
the
house
and
literally
just
about
to
effectuate
entry
when
the
detention
took
place.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
perhaps,
but
we
have
been
unable
to
find
any
examples
of
detentions
of
occupants
of
the
premises
until
at
least
1880.
and
our
point
is
simply
that
the
detention
ceases
to
be
truly
incident
to
the
search
where
the
individual
has
left
the
scene.
the
justifications
for
the
detention
evaporate
at
that
point.
thank
you.
