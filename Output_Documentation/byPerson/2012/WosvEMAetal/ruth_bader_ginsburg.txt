justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
answered
the
question
with
respect
to
jury
verdicts.
i
suppose
it
would
be
no
different
if
it
's
the
judge
that
found
the
10
percent
rather
than
the
jury.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
that
justice
breyer
was
asking
about
the
10
percent
has
already
been
answered
because
we
were
told
that
if
a
jury
allocated
10
percent
to
medicals,
it
would
not
make
any
difference,
the
statute
entitles
the
state
to
30
percent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
--
i
thought
your
brief
says
that
at
some
point,
if
it
gets
too
high,
you
do
have
a
problem
under
these
anti-lien
provisions
of
medicaid?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
--
is
that
what
happens?
you
said
you
--
that
in
north
carolina
for
workers'
compensation
--
for
settlements
that
are
subject
to
workers'
compensation
liens,
you
have
this
type
of
system.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
it
work
for
workers'
compensation
recoveries
that
have
the
same
thing,
they
--
they
owe
the
state
for
the
medical.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
--
do
you
agree
that
the
only
flaw
in
the
north
carolina
statute
is
that
it's
a
fixed
amount,
and
that
if
it
were
a
rebuttable
presumption
it
would
be
okay?
if
the
north
carolina
law
says
30
percent
is
the
cap,
but
in
a
particular
case
you
can
show
that
that's
not
a
fair
allocation?
