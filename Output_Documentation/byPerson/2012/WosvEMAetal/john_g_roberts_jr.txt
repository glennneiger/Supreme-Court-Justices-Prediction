chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-98,
delia
v.
e.m.a.--
mr.
maddrey?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it
can
--
it
can
participate
in
that
process,
can't
it?
its
money's
at
issue?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
browning?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
worse
than
that.
he
does
care,
because
the
smaller
amount
means
that
the
victim
is
going
to
actually
get
to
keep
more
and
that's
all
the
victim's
lawyer
is
concerned
about,
and
that's
fine
with
the
tortfeasor's
lawyer
because
otherwise
he
would
have
to
pay
more.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sorry
to--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
the
same
point.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
fair?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
exactly
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
going
to
say,
how
do
we
know
what's
fair
and
appropriate?
you
come
in
--
let's
say
you
have
$20,000
in
medical
expenses
and
a
claim
for
pain
and
suffering.
and
they
come
in
and
they
recover
a
million
dollars,
right?
so
what's
appropriate
in
that
case?
the
other
side
will
say:
well,
we
settled
on
a
million
dollars,
pain
and
suffering
was
really
20
million
and
we
came
down
to
a
million.
so
what's
fair
allocation
in
the
case
of
the
medical
expenses?
it
seems
to
be
an
entirely
artificial
judgment.
to
the
extent
it's
not,
it
depends
on
the
views
of
the
two
parties
negotiating
and
i
thought
we
established
that
that
is
entirely
subject
to
manipulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
--
it's
a
little
better
than
that,
but
go
ahead
and
answer.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
said
several
times
that
the
way
you
do
this
is
based
on
the
judge's
experience
and
so
on
with
--
with
the
cases.
and
i
think
what
your
--
your
friend
on
the
other
side
is
saying
is
that's
pretty
much
what's
going
on
here
except
over
time
--
i
mean,
would
it
be
all
right
if
over
time
the
judge
says,
well,
typically,
sometimes
it's
25
percent,
sometimes
it's
35
percent,
over
time,
it's
sort
of
33
percent.
and
so
we're
going
to
have
that
as
an
absolute
rule
so
that
we
don't
have
to
go
through
these
proceedings
every
time
just
to
make
sure
that
it's
30
percent
rather
than
33
percent.
what's
--
i
guess
it's
justice
kagan's
question
--
what's
wrong
with
the
bright-line
rule
here?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we're
dealing
with
a
north
carolina
statute.
don't
they
get
deference
along
the
same
lines?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
can't
be
very
clear
because
cms
took
the
opposite
position
before
this
case,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
anders?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
thanks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
a
reasonable
--
this
is
the
federal
district
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
not
a
state
procedure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
what
if
the
other
--
the
parties
i
guess
are
coming
in
and
saying,
well,
that's
not
how
juries
work.
they
don't
care
that
this
measure
of
damages
is
particularly
calculable.
they
come
to
a
general
view.
you've
got
medical
expenses,
you've
got
pain
and
suffering.
they
make
a
judgment
about
that.
would
that
be
a
good
argument
to
make?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
how
would
it
take
it
into
account?
you
said,
well,
because
the
medical
expenses
are
readily
calculable,
we
assume
that
that's
what
the
jury
meant
first,
and
then
the
other
stuff
is
extra
so
the
state
can
get
it.
but
maybe
sometimes
they
just
come
to
a
--
a
total
figure
and
they
don't
care
how
it's
allocated.
you
say,
well,
that's
an
argument
they
can
make.
well,
what's
a
judge
supposed
to
do
in
a
particular
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
this
is
a
real,
significant
increase
in
the
burden
on
the
state
under
the
medicaid
program.
you're
saying
yes,
you
can
try
to
recover
recovery
from
third-party
tortfeasors,
but
if
you
do
that
you've
got
to
set
up
this
apparatus
where
everybody
can
come
in
and
you've
got
to
prove
what
the
allocation
was
and
all
that.
so
--
i
mean
some
--
34
states
haven't
done
that,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yes,
for
your
purposes.
but
i'm
interested
in
my
purposes.
and
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
whether
or
not
that's
a
significant
financial
burden
on
the
state
--
if
they're
going
to
go
about
trying
to
recover
this
money,
that
they've
got
to
provide
some
apparatus,
administrative,
judicial,
whatever,
to
make
a
calculation
that
i
still
don't
understand
what
it's
addressed
to.
and
not
only
that,
but
even
if
you
do
know
what
it's
addressed
to,
you
just
take
into
account
all
these
things
and
come
up
with
an
equitable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
maddrey,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
