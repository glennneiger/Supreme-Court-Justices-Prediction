justice
antonin
scalia
they
must
allocate?
is
the
state
saying,
you
do
not
own
that
30
percent
of
the
recovery,
so
you
never
get
a
property
right
in
it,
so
that
there's
never
any
problem
about
asserting
a
lien
against
it?
i
thought
that's
what's
going
on
here.
and
i
think
that's
sort
of
disguised
by
talking
about
allocation.
i
thought
the
state
is
saying,
as
to
30
percent
of
the
recovery,
you
have
no
property
right
in
it.
is
it
not
saying
that?
am
i
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
you
didn't
hear
my
--
my
question.
my
question
is:
is
the
state
saying
that
you
have
no
property
right
in
the
30
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
my
question
again.
is
the
state
saying
that
you
have
no
property
right
in
the
30
percent?
i
think
that
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
bind
the
parties
for
other
purposes,
i
assume.
there
are
other
purposes
for
which
the
distinction
between
pain
and
suffering
and
medical
expenses
might
make
a
difference,
right?
what
if
the
parties
agreed
that
it's
50/50?
would
the
state
take
50
percent
then,
or
is
the
state
still
limited
to
30?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
the
statute
may
--
may
give
you
the
answer?
it
says:
"any
attorney
retained
by
the
beneficiary
shall
out
of
the
proceeds
obtained
on
behalf
of
the
beneficiary
by
settlement
with,
judgment
against,
or
otherwise
from
a
third
party
by
reason
of
injury
or
death
distribute
to
the
department
the
amount
of
assistance
paid
by
the
department
on
behalf
of.
"
"up
to
33
percent.
"
it
applies
to
judgments
as
well
as
to
settlements.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
don't
understand
that.
you
see,
i
think
the
only
way
you
can
defend
it
is
that
--
is
that
the
recipient
never
--
never
had
a
property
right.
once
--
once
recovery
is
given
to
the
recipient,
the
recovery
does
not
belong
to
the
recipient.
and
if
that's
true
for
33
percent,
it
can
be
true
for
100
percent.
has
there
ever
been
any
litigation
since
1935
about
takings
problems,
with
--
with
the
state
requiring
33
percent
to
go
to
the
medical
provider,
even
though
it
may
well
be
that
less
or
more
of
that
amount
went
to
medical
damages?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question.
i
mean
that
portion,
according
to
north
carolina,
is
one-third.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
what
the
state
says
is
the
law.
i
mean,
the
state
says
one-third
is
for
medical.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
need,
ultimately
you
need
an
adjudication.
you
have
to
leave
it
either
to
a
jury
to
decide
what
percentage
of
the
total
award
is
medical
expenses
or
have
a
separate
proceeding.
let's
say
where
there
has
been
a
settlement,
you
need
a
separate
proceeding
to
decide
how
much
of
it
is
really
for
medical.
you
know,
they
may
say
10
percent
is,
but
who
believes
that?
you
need
a
proceeding.
that
is
awfully
time-consuming.
and
as
justice
kagan
suggests,
i'm
not
sure
it's
going
to
be
very
accurate.
i
don't
think
a
jury
determination
is
going
to
be
--
is
going
to
be
accurate
on
that
score.
and
i
don't
know
how
you
go
about
determining
how
much
of
a
settlement
is
attributable
to
medical
expenses
versus
other
things,
especially
when
the
settlement
itself
says
only
10
percent
is
medical
expenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
what
do
you
adjudicate?
what
is
the
issue
in
the
adjudication?
how
much
of
the
award
should
have
been
allocated
to
medical
expenses,
or
how
much
of
the
award
was
in
fact
allocated
to
medical
expenses?
which
is
the
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it
should
be
the
latter,
shouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
how
much
was
allocated,
right?
it
doesn't
matter
what
ought
to
have
been.
the
issue
is
what
proportion
did
the
parties
in
fact
allocate
to
medical
expenses,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
say
1
penny.
how
are
you
going
to
contradict
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
but
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
putting
--
putting
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
as
you
say
is
done
in
the
workmen'
compensation,
is
quite
different
from
what
you're
proposing
here.
that
seems
to
me
quite
workable,
you
know.
the
--
the
court
hears
the
evidence
and
he
decides
how
much
should
be
reimbursed
within
--
within
the
court's
discretion.
but
here,
you're
--
you're
asking
a
court
to
decide
how
much
of
a
recovery
or
how
much
of
a
settlement
was
attributable
to
--
to
the
medical
portion.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
totally
different
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
be
the
defendant
who's
--
who's
--
who's
jiggering
the
system,
i
mean,
not
suing
for
the
medical
portion
simply
because
the
defendant
knows
that
at
least
some
of
that
portion,
if
not
all
of
it,
would
--
would
go
--
would
go
to
the
state.
so,
in
a
situation
such
as
yours
where
the
total
recovery
is
--
is
not
going
to
suffice
to
cover
both
pain
and
suffering
and
medical
expenses,
it'd
be
very
intelligent
to
do
what
justice
alito
proposed.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
real,
i
don't
know,
gaming
--
gaming
of
the
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
have
a
--
i
have
a
theoretical
problem
right
at
the
outset.
i
mean,
what
the
statute
forbids
is
asserting
a
lien
on
recovery
that
is
for
medical
expenses.
and
you're
telling
me
that
the
states
aren't
even
trying
to
find
out
what
portion
of
the
recovery
was
for
medical
expenses.
they're
looking
to
determine
what
proportion
should
have
been
for
medical
expenses.
how
does
that
tie
in
with
the
--
with
the
prohibition
of
the
lien?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
you're
saying
that
the
state
can,
in
making
this
determination,
in
fact
take
away
from
a
plaintiff
who
has
recovered
a
--
a
greater
amount
in
medical
expenses,
or
a
lesser
amount
in
medical
expenses,
can
take
--
take
away
that
by
determining
how
much
should
have
been
allocated
to
medical
expenses,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
messing
up
the
lien
law
anyway,
no
matter
which
way
you
play
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
hhs
has
--
has
authority
over
how
a
state
recovers.
i
don't
see
that
it's
part
of
the
administration
of
the
statute
committed
to
hhs.
so,
i,
you
know,
i
admire
you're
not
citing
chevron.
