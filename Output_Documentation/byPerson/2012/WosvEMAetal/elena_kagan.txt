justice
elena
kagan
general,
how
do
you
come
up
with
33?
why
33?
why
not
10
or
60
or
90?
why
--
how
did
you
come
up
with
the
number?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
you
were
--
you
were
telling
me
a
little
bit
about
the
history
of
this
statute.
but
why
30?
is
there
any
indication
of
why
the
state
picked
30?
justice
elena
kagan
if
that's
where
it
comes
from,
then
it
does
relate
to
a
kind
of
estimate,
doesn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
general,
on
your
theory
am
i
correct
that
the
north
carolina
legislature
could
amend
this
statute
tomorrow
to
make
it
two-thirds?
justice
elena
kagan
but
that's
what
i
mean.
i
mean,
on
your
theory
it
seems
not
to
matter
whether
this
statute
says
one-third
or
two-thirds.
and
i'm
asking
whether
that's
correct.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
i
got
that.
in
other
words,
i'm
assuming
an
amendment
that
just
all
it
does
is
it
changes
one-third
to
two-thirds.
and
so
your
theory
it
seems
to
me
would
work
the
exact
same
way.
then
you
say:
well,
you
need
a
rational
basis
for
doing
that.
but
i
thought
you
told
me
that
the
one-third
really
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
an
estimate
of
how
much
is
medical
and
how
much
is
not
medical.
so
it
seems
that
you
would
have
the
same
basis
to
say
two-thirds
as
you
do
to
say
one-third.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you're
saying
there's
a
kind
of
side
constraint,
that
medicaid
recipients
have
to
be
treated
like
others,
but
then
presumably,
the
state
could
change
everybody's?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
browning,
let
me
give
you
a
different
rationale
for
this
statute.
it's
different
than
the
one
the
state
suggests,
but
it
would
go
something
like
this:
there
is
an
allocation
that
has
to
be
made.
in
making
allocations
there
are
two
ways
of
doing
it.
we
can
do
it
case-by-case,
individualized
decisionmaking;
or
we
can
use
some
bright-line
rules.
and
the
advantage
of
bright-line
rules
is
that
they
are
cheap
and
efficient
and
sometimes
they
are
not
more
inaccurate
than
individualized
decisionmaking,
because
in
individualized
decisionmaking
you
can
maker
errors,
too.
so
this
is
a
reasonable
way
to
make
an
allocation
decision.
and
nothing
that
we
said
in
ahlborn
suggests
that
a
state
needs
to
use
case-by
case
decisionmaking
rather
than
bright-line
rules
to
make
the
allocation
that
it
needs
to
make
between
medical
and
nonmedical
damages.
what
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
and
in
those
rebuttal
presumption
states,
can
both
sides
come
in
and
try
to
rebut
it?
so
the
individual
beneficiary
can
try
to
rebut
it,
but
the
states
could
as
well?
or
is
it
just
a
right
for
the
beneficiary
to
try
to
rebut
the
presumption?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
general,
how
about
this,
and
i
am
having
a
little
bit
of
trouble
here
because
i
think
a
state
could
come
in,
or
i
think
there
is
a
reasonable
argument
that
a
state
could
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
we've
made
an
estimate,
and
here's
our
best
estimate,
and
we
don't
think
there
is
a
need
for
an
individualized
decisionmaking
on
top
of
that.
but
as
i
understand
your
argument,
that
is
not
what
you
are
saying.
you
are
making
a
very
different
kind
of
argument,
suggesting
that
you
can
take
this
number
any
place,
no
matter
what
the
relationship
between
the
number
and
the
actual
allocation
that
cases
--
that
allocation
of
medical
and
nonmedical
damages
in
the
real
world.
so
if
that's
the
case,
what
do
i
do?
