ms.
ginger
d.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
start
with
the
types
of
procedures
that
states
may
use
to
allocate
medical
damages,
i
think
the
states
have
a
broad
range
of
discretion
to
determine
what
should
be
an
appropriate
allocation.
they're
not--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--sorry.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
is
this
better?
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
so
the
states
are
not
determining,
they're
not
trying
to
reconstruct
what
the
plaintiff's
and
the
defendant's
intent
was
in
entering
into
the
settlement.
often,
there
will
be
no
shared
intent.
what
--
what
the
states
are
doing
is
determining
what
the
appropriate
allocation
should
be.
and
the
states
that
have
individualized
determinations,
which
is
what
we
think
is
required
here,
have
developed
a
number
of
different
procedures
for
doing
that.
for
instance,
a
district
court
in
pennsylvania,
in
mckinney--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
this
court
established
in
ahlborn
that
the
beneficiary
and
the
state,
they
respectively
have
interests
in
the
settlement
that
arises
from
the
fact
that
in
the
tort
case
the
plaintiff
has
asserted
claims
for
medical
damages
and
for
nonmedical
damages.
and
so
ahlborn
establishes
that
we
need
to
divide
the
two
in
order
to
determine
what
the
state
may
recover.
ahlborn
also
establishes
that
the
beneficiary
has
an
interest
in
the
settlement
that
arises
from
her
nonmedical
claims
that
can
be
allocated
away
by
an
allocation
method,
such
as
one
that
gives
--
that
says
that
100
percent
of
the
settlement
must
always
be
allocated
to
--
to
medical
damages.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
the
state
does
have
some
discretion
to
determine
what
the
appropriate--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
ahlborn
establishes
that
we
have
to
make
some
kind
of
division
of
the
settlement,
and
when
the
parties
haven't
done
it,
there's
no
jury
determination.
we
don't
know
ahead
of
time
before
the
allocation
has
been
done
what
precisely
the
amount
the
medical
damages
should
be.
but
we
do
know,
because
the
plaintiff,
the
beneficiary,
has
asserted
nonmedical
claims
and
she
has
compromised
them,
we
do
know
that
she
has
an
interest
in
the
settlement
that
arises
from
her
nonmedical
claims.
so
for
instance,
you
can
imagine
the
situation
in
which
a
plaintiff
has
a
claim
that
is
10
percent
medical
damages
and
90
percent
lost
--
past
lost
wages.
so
they're
both
equally
concrete.
in
that
situation,
when
the
plaintiff
settles
for
pennies
on
the
dollar,
i
think
we
would
have
serious
questions
about
whether
a
one-third
allocation
to
medical
damages
in
that
case
would
be
appropriate.
but
without
an
individualized
determination,
there
would
be
no
way
to
know
whether
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
--
the
blanket
rule
that
the
state
has
is
actually
overestimating
the
amount
that
should
be
appropriately
allocated
to
medical
damages.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
certainly.
so
for
instance,
in
mckinney
v.
philadelphia
housing
authority,
a
district
court
case
in
pennsylvania,
what
the
court
did
was
it
said:
we
have
the
settlement;
we
know
how
much
the
past
medical
damages
were
because
we
know
what
the
medical
bills
were;
and
we
can
--
we
can
assume
that
the
jury,
had
this
case
gone
to
trial,
would
have
awarded
100
percent
of
the
medical
damages
because
they
were
provable
and
because
there
weren't
disputes
about
that.
and
so
the
court
then
said:
i'm
going
to
then
apply
a
discount
rate
for
the
uncertainty
that
the
defendant
would
have
been
held
liable
at
all.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that
was
the
federal
district
court.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
pennsylvania
law.
that
case
happened
to
be
in
federal
court.
pennsylvania
law
provided
a
rebuttable
presumption,
and
so
the
court
determined--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
the
court
could
take
that
into
account
in
allocating,
yes,
some--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
--
this
is
positing
a
situation
in
which
there's
been
a
settlement
rather
than
a
jury
determination.
so
i
think
that
the
--
the
court
that's
doing
the
allocating
has
some
discretion
here.
and
so
one
thing
it
can
do
is
say
i'm
going
to
essentially
prioritize
medical
damages,
because
i
think
juries
usually
will
award
them.
but
a
state
could
also
provide
that
the
inquiry
should
be
more
equitable
and
open-ended.
so,
for
instance,
illinois
and
missouri
have
provided
simply
that
--
that
the
court
shall
make
an
equitable
allocation.
it
can
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
plaintiff
may
receive
a
double
recovery.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
that's
absolutely
right.
and
--
and
to
return
to
one
of
justice
kagan's
earlier
questions,
i
think
a
one-third
allocation
may
be
in
the
mine
run
of
cases
a
reasonable
presumption.
but
there
will
be
some
cases,
like
my
90
percent,
10
percent
example,
where
it
isn't
a
reasonable
allocation.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
in
those
states,
it's
just
a
right
for
the
beneficiary
to
try
to
rebut
the
presumption.
some
of
those
states
start
with
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
full
reimbursement.
so
--
so
the
presumption
starts
at
the
full
amount
that
the
state
paid.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
what's
more
significant
for
our
purposes
is
that
16
states
plus
d.c.
have,
and--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
don't
think
that
these
states
have
found
that
it's
a
significant
administrative
burden.
one
reason
is
that
once
the
allocation
rules
are
in
place,
it's
our
understanding
that
most
of
these
cases
settle.
the
beneficiary
and
the
state
agree
as
to
what
the
allocation
is,
so
this
doesn't
go
to
a
hearing
in
the
first
place.
but
even
--
even
when
there
are
hearings,
i
think
states
can
take
significant
measures
to
lessen
the
burden.
for
instance--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--there
are
--
there
are
five
other
states
like
north
carolina
that
have
an
irrebuttable
presumption
with
a
cap.
there
are
10
others
that
have
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
we
think,
of
full
reimbursement.
but
i
should
caveat
that
by
saying
that
we
simply
don't
know
in
those
states
what
they
do,
what
their
practices
are.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
we
think
that
--
the
position
reflected
in
our
brief
is
hhs's
considered
position,
and
we
do
think
that
it's
--
it
is
persuasive.
now,
hhs
presumably
could
regulate,
it
could
go
through
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
and
establish
rules--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--we
haven't
claimed
chevron
deference.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--there
aren't
regulations
on
this.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
hhs
has
--
the
statute
requires
the
states
to
--
to
enact
reasonable
measures
for
recovery.
hhs
thinks
that
a
measure
that
circumvents
the
anti-lien
provision
like
north
carolina's
wouldn't
be
a
reasonable
measure,
but
there
aren't
regulations
on
that
subject.
