i
don't
want
to
take
up
too
much
time
talking
about
andrews,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
said
in
andrews
is
that
in
those
states
where
there
is
a
prior
determination,
that
controls,
but
north
carolina
is
entitled
to
adopt
a
different
procedure
and
have
a
one-third
across-the-board
rule.
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
accord
with
your
understanding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.

the
second
case
is
no.
12-98,
wos
versus
ema.
when
a
medicaid
beneficiary
is
injured
and
later
receives
a
tort
judgment
or
settlement.
the
federal
medicaid
statute
requires
states
to
seek
reimbursement
for
the
amount
of
the
money
the
states
expended
for
the
beneficiary's
medical
care,
at
the
same
time,
the
federal
medicaid
statute
prohibits
states
from
placing
a
lien
on
any
portion
of
the
tort
recovery
not
designated
as
payments
for
medical
care.
a
north
carolina
law
says
that
one
third
of
any
beneficiary's
tort
recovery
represents
payment
for
medical
care.
of
course
the
state's
share
is
capped
so
its
recovery
is
the
lesser,
the
full
amount
of
its
expenditure
or
one
third
of
the
beneficiary's
tort
recovery.
the
question
is
whether
this
law
is
consistent
with
the
anti-lien
provision
in
the
federal
statute.
respondent,
e.
m.
a.
and
her
parents
sued
her
physician
in
a
hospital
where
she
was
born
after
she
suffered
multiple
serious
birth
injuries
that
left
her
deaf,
blind
and
with
little
mobility.
she
requires
between
12
and
18
hours
of
skilled
nursing
care
per
day.
the
lawsuit
sought
damages
for
e.
m.
a.
and
for
her
parents.
though
the
damages
sought
were
over
$42
million,
the
suit
was
settled
with
the
assistance
of
a
mediator
for
$2.8
million
and
this
amount
apparently
was
driven
in
large
part
by
the
amount
of
insurance
coverage
that
was
available.
under
the
statute
here
at
issue,
the
state
statute,
north
carolina
demanded
one
third
of
this
amount
as
reimbursement
for
its
expenses.
e.
m.
a.
and
her
parents
argued
that
the
state's
one
third
rule
violates
the
medicaid
anti-lien
provision.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
that
this
north
carolina's
law
is
invalid.
this
court
agrees.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
the
court
concludes
that
the
federal
anti-lien
provision
does
preempt
north
carolina's
irrebuttable
statutory
presumption.
in
an
earlier
case
from
this
court
called
arkansas
department
of
health
and
human
services
versus
ahlborn,
the
court
held
that
the
federal
medicaid
statutes
says
both
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
on
a
state's
potential
share
of
the
beneficiary's
tort
recovery
through
federal
law
that
requires
an
assignment
to
the
state
the
right
to
recover
the
portion
of
a
settlement
that
represents
payments
for
medical
care.
but
that
same
federal
law
also
prohibits
the
state
from
taking
any
part
of
the
remainder
of
the
settlement.
under
north
carolina
statute
however,
when
the
state's
medicaid
expenditures
exceed
one
third
of
the
beneficiary's
tort
recovery,
the
statute
establishes
a
conclusive
presumption
that
the
one
third
of
the
recovery
represents
compensation
for
medical
expenses.
north
carolina's
law
in
some
circumstances
would
permit
the
state
to
take
a
portion
of
the
medicaid
beneficiary's
tort
judgment
or
settlement
not
designated
for
medical
care.
the
law
sets
forth
no
process
for
determining
what
portion
of
the
beneficiary
tort
recovery
is
attributable
to
medical
expenses.
instead,
the
state
has
picked
arbitrary
percentage,
and
by
statutory
command
labeled
that
portion
of
the
beneficiary's
tort
recovery
is
representing
payment
for
medical
care.
the
state
may
evade
preemption
through
creative
statutory
interpretation
or
description.
the
court's
opinion
in
ahlborn
contemplated
the
possibility
of
an
allocation.
it
envisage
that
a
judicial
or
administrative
proceeding
would
be
necessary
where
a
beneficiary
and
the
state
cannot
agree
on
what
portion
of
the
settlement
represents
compensation
for
medical
expenses.
north
carolina's
irrebuttable
one
size
fits
all
presumption
is
incompatible
with
the
federal
statute.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
joined.
