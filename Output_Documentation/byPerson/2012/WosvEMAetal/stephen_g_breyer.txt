justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
somewhat
technical
--
and
i
appreciate
your
paying
attention
because
it's
hard
for
me
to
keep
all
this
in
my
mind.
all
right.
it's
my
understanding
of
north
carolina,
everyone
accepts
the
rule
and
north
carolina
agrees
that
if
you
in
--
in
north
carolina
advance
to
the
victim
$50,000
in
medical
expenses
--
now,
you're
never
going
to
get
more
than
that
back
and
you
don't
want
more
than
that
back.
now,
the
victim
and
the
tortfeasor
enter
into
a
settlement
and
you
have
a
rule
and
the
rule
is
you
will
never
get
more
than
50,000
or
33
percent,
whichever
is
less.
that's
the
rule,
whichever
is
less.
so
if
the
settlement
is
for
$100,000,
you
are
not
going
to
take
more
than
33,
so
you
have
advanced
50.
okay.
so
you
have
basically
three
situations.
the
first
situation
is
where
a
judge
has
said,
you
know
what,
i
find
that
only
$10,000
of
this
settlement
is
for
medical
expenses.
in
that
case
you
take
$10,000,
no
more.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh.
i
got
the
impression
that
if
there
was
a
judicial
--
there
are
three
situations:
one
is
there
is
a
judicial
finding
that
only
10
percent
was
medical.
and
the
second
is
the
situation
where
they
stipulate
that
only
10
percent
is
for
medical,
and
the
third
situation
is
this
situation,
namely
there
is
no
stipulation
and
there
is
no
judicial
finding.
so
my
thought,
which
is
wrong
i
guess,
is
if
the
judge
says
it's
10
percent
you
won't
take
more
than
10
percent,
but
if
in
fact
it's
a
stipulation
of
10
percent
north
carolina
courts
have
not
yet
decided
that,
and
this
is
a
case
where
there
is
no
stipulation
and
no
judicial
finding.
now
you're
telling
me
i
have
that
wrong.
so
you
explain
what
the
north
carolina
is
on
that,
because
i
think
it
makes
quite
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
in
the
settlement
they
stipulate
that
10
percent
is
for
medical
and
the
rest
for
pain
and
suffering.
now,
i
thought
north
carolina
courts
have
not
yet
decided
whether
north
carolina
--
which
would
like
more
than
10
percent
--
can
get
it.
is
that
true
or
not
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have
decided?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
ahlborn.
ahlborn
we
all
agree
says
you
cannot
get
more
than
medical,
the
medical
expense,
okay?
the
question
here
is
how
to
figure
that.
so
i
thought
that
one
way
to
figure
it
--
i
will
just
be
repeating
myself.
one
way
to
figure
it
is
how
much
of
this
$100,000
settlement
is
attributable
to
medical
expenses
as
a
judge
would
say.
now,
you're
telling
me
there
is
a
case
in
north
carolina
which
says
if
the
judge
himself
says
that
10
percent
of
the
settlement
is
for
medical,
that's
not
what
california
--
that
doesn't
matter
according
to
north
carolina
law,
and
i'd
like
the
name
of
the
case,
the
state
case
that
says
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
we
know
what
you
would
like,
but
we
don't
know
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
go
back
for
a
second?
because
i
want
to
show
you
where
i
got
my
perhaps
mistaken
idea
from.
there
is
a
case
called
andrews.
and
there
is
a
statement
in
andrews,
which
is
a
south
--
north
carolina
case
--
which
says
in
certain
circumstances,
although
the
statute
says
just
what
justice
scalia
says,
the
lawyer
sits
there,
he
takes
one-third
and
pays
it
to
the
state.
then
this
case
has
this
sentence
in
it:
"ahlborn
controls
when
there
has
been
a
prior
determination
or
stipulation
as
to
the
medical
expense
portion
of
a
plaintiff's
settlement.
"
"in
those
cases,
the
state
may
not
receive
reimbursement
in
excess
of
the
portion
so
designated.
"
now,
having
read
that
sentence,
i
thought
the
law
of
north
carolina
was
that
this
statute
does
not
apply,
and
that
when,
in
fact,
the
jury
or
the
judge
finds
that
only
10
percent
was
for
medical
expenses,
the
state
cannot
take
more
than
10
percent.
and
the
same
is
true
of
a
stipulation.
that's
what
those
words
seem
to
say
to
me.
now
you're
telling
me
that
i'm
not
reading
those
words
correctly,
the
case
of
andrews
does
not
affect
our
case
here,
and
that
you
--
that
the
law
of
north
carolina
is
that
you
get
one-third.
now,
what
is
it?
do
you
see
why
i
am
confused?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
a
prior
determination
or
stipulation.
i
took
prior
determination
to
mean
a
determination
by
a
judge
or
a
jury.
what
does
it
mean,
if
it
doesn't
mean
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work?
because
i
would
imagine
at
the
negotiation
you
have
the
victim's
lawyer
and
the
tortfeasor's
lawyer
and
the
tortfeasor's
lawyer
is
interested
that
the
bottom
line
number
be
as
low
as
possible
and
the
victim's
number,
that
it
be
as
high
as
possible.
and
the
victim's
lawyer
in
fact
would
like
as
little
as
possible
to
be
allocated
to
a
source
which
is
going
to
take
that
money
away
from
him.
so
they
can
reach
agreement.
what
they
will
do
is
say
1
penny
is
for
medical
expenses
and
everything
else
is
for
pain
and
suffering,
and
that's
very
good
for
the
victim.
and
it's
irrelevant
to
the
tortfeasor.
so
when
you
see
that
on
a
piece
of
paper,
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
do?
what
kind
of
proceeding
are
you
going
to
have?
it's
a
proceeding
about
a
proceeding.
it's
a
proceeding
about
the
settlement
negotiation.
what's
it
going
to
look
like?
what
does
it
look
like
in
the
16
states?
we
will
have
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
testify.
he
will
say,
your
honor,
i
really
wanted
1
penny
and
only
1
penny
to
be
allocated
to
pain
and
--
to
medical
expense.
and
the
defendant's
lawyer,
he's
being
very
honest,
he'll
say:
i
didn't
care;
if
that's
what
he
wants,
that's
fine
with
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
so
what
does
it
look
like?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
same
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
it
work
in
those
states?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
am
asking
the
same
question.
there
are
16
states
that
have
this
procedure.
how
does
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
to
know
that
they
have
it.
i
want
to
know
how
it
works.
we
have
put
the
problem
as
to
why
it
seems
it
might
not
work
too
well,
and
now
i
would
like
you
to
tell
us
how
it
really
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
--
you're
satisfied
with
the
presumption.
is
there
any
law
here
that
gives
you
a
leg-up?
i
mean,
is
this
like
chevron
or
skidmore
or
something
like
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
that's
their
position.
but
my
question
is,
does
the
law
mean
that
when
we
decide
this
case,
i
see
you
have
a
reasonable
point,
they
have
a
reasonable
point,
that
if
both
points
are
reasonable,
you
get
the
benefit
of
some
kind
of
legal
presumption
like
chevron,
skidmore,
et
cetera.
maybe
you
can
think
of
another
one,
i
don't
know.
do
you
or
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
--
the
missing
part
here
--
maybe
i
just
missed
it
--
we're
interpreting
a
statute,
and
the
part
that
trumps
the
lien
provision
is
the
part
that
says
the
state
is
entitled
to
payment
that
has
been
made
for
medical
assistance
for
health
care
items
--
and
some
other
similar
language
is
in
the
statute.
they
think
their
one-third
rule
is
a
good
way
of
measuring
that.
you
think
that
the
one-third
rule
as
a
rebuttable
presumption
is
a
better
way
of
measuring
that.
now
normally,
or
often,
i
would
see
government
arguments
like
that
where
they'd
say:
and
by
the
way,
we're
interpreting
very
technical
language
in
our
statute,
and
chevron
and/or
skidmore
means
that
you
should
give
us
particular
weight.
is
that
part
of
your
argument
here,
and
if
it
isn't,
why
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
impression
is
that
you
get
chevron
deference
on
the
basis
of
whether
congress
--
and
there's
a
lot
of
rules
and
so
forth,
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
haven't
claimed
it.
and
i
--
so
that
puzzles
me
--
and
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
not
--
you
argue
what
you
want
to
argue,
but
i
--
this
is
awfully
technical
language.
it's
a
minor
interstitial
claim.
