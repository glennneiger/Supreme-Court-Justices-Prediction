justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
know
that
ex
ante?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
could
you
ever
know
that
ex
ante?
i
mean,
without
looking
at
the
individual
facts
of
the
case,
the
30
percent
is
going
to
be
underinclusive
in
some
circumstances,
overinclusive
in
others.
so
how
do
you
deal
with
our
holding
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
the
overinclusive
portion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
life
is
never
certain,
and
so
i
don't
even
go
to
that
issue.
i
go
just
simply
to
the
question,
how
can
you,
ex
ante,
predict
--
particularly
with
a
statute
that
wasn't
based
on
any
empirical
data
--
that
30
percent
normally
is
the
right
amount?
you
just
picked
it
out
of
the
air?
you
could
pick
40,
50,
60.
how
do
we
draw
the
line?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
how
does
it
have
the
right
to
announce
that
in
a
fela
case
or
in
a
jones
act
case
where
those
injured
parties,
they
have
a
property
right
in
their
protection
but
this
statute
applies
to
that
recovery
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
can
deny
a
litigant
a
property
right
in
that
recovery?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
how
you
can
go
in
and
ask
for
something
you
don't
own.
i
don't
know
how
the
plaintiff
can
go
in
and
litigate
a
case
if
they
don't
have
a
property
interest
that
they
can
then
assign
to
someone
else.
i've
never
heard
of
such
a
thing,
how
they
would
have
standing
to
sue
on
your
behalf
if
they
have
no
property
interest
in
the
recovery.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
sue
for
something
you
have
no
property
interest
in?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
has
to
be
some
interest
in
the
30
percent
by
the
plaintiff.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
just
clarify
one
point?
does
this
rule
preclude
parties,
as
we
said
in
ahlborn,
from
stipulating
to
a
settlement
at
all?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
brief
is
not
clear
on
that.
they
can
still
stipulate.
it's
only
if
after
the
stipulation,
it
hasn't
been
allocated
that
you
can
recover?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you're
basically
now
saying
is
that
there
can
never
be
a
stipulation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
saying
that
the
parties
cannot
enter
into
a
stipulation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
didn't
hear
justice
ginsburg's
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
basically
you
are
saying
the
judge
would
be
required
to
give
you
your
one-third
regardless
of
what
the
jury
said.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
all
those
states
that
have
jury
verdicts,
special
verdicts
that
require
a
certain
amount,
they
could
avoid
that
by
just
simply
passing
this
law
and
avoid
the
anti-lien
statute
that
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
16
states
already
have
something
close
to
a
presumption
of
a
percentage.
do
you
have
any
evidence
that
in
those
16
states
where
it's
only
a
presumption
and
not
a
fixed
amount,
that
they
are
falling
apart
because
of
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
the
absence
of
this
statute,
what
did
your
state
do
beforehand?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
am
i
correct
that
what
you
believe
and
what
the
courts
have
been
doing
in
your
state,
the
lower
courts,
is
that
they
won't
approve
a
settlement
that
doesn't
have
the
one-third,
and
they
won't
enter
a
judgment
that
doesn't
have
the
one-third?
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i'm
right.
they
just
won't
accept
the
private
stipulation
that
doesn't
do
that,
and
they
won't
enter
into
a
judgment
that
doesn't
do
that,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
answer
my
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
going
back
to
justice
alito's.
the
jury
says
it's
less
or
more
or
whatever
of
--
of
the
settlement
as
medical
expenses,
it
doesn't
matter
what
they
say,
the
court
can't
enter
a
judgment
for
that
amount,
they
have
to
enter
a
judgment
for
either
the
one-third
or
the
full
medical
expenses.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that's
what
they
have
been
doing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know
that
was
argued
before.
but
i
read
ahlborn
very
carefully,
and
i
don't
see
it.
i
read
the
amici
briefs
that
reference
different
procedures,
and
not
one
of
them
referenced
the
north
carolina
procedure.
so,
i
know
that
was
argued
before.
you
didn't
argue
it
in
your
brief
here,
and
i
assume
you
didn't
because
you
did
what
i
did,
which
was
to
read
ahlborn
carefully
and
read
what
it
cited,
and
i
don't
see
it
cited.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
see
the
north
carolina
procedure
referenced
in
ahlborn
as
something
that
states
could
do.
it
wasn't
referenced
directly
in
the
--
in
the
opinion,
and
it
wasn't
referenced
indirectly
by
the
amici.
the
amici
were
talking
about
substantially
different
procedures.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
my
point
is,
justice
kennedy's
question
was
that
somehow
in
that
opinion,
we
approved
the
north
carolina
system.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
a
direct
reference
to
north
carolina's
system--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
that
or
in
any
of
the
amici
brief
that
talked
about
different
state
rules?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
16
are
doing
it
already.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
because
they
know
they
are
going
to
be
subject
to
a
hearing
if
they
don't
reach
an
agreement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
is
an
inducement
for
them
to
do
what
this
state
didn't
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
told
to
come
in,
they
ignored
it.
in
those
states,
states
know
they
are
going
to
increase
potentially
their
costs,
so
they
come
in
more
often.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
judges
do
this
in
non-medicaid
cases
regularly?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
deal
with
what
appears
to
be
many
of
my
colleagues'
gut
instinct,
okay?
this
is
--
it
costs
too
much,
it's
too
burdensome.
we've
already
answered
why
not,
but
in
the
end,
they
don't
believe
you
could
ever
figure
out
the
number.
that's
really
their
bottom
line,
that
this
number's
artificial
no
matter
what
you
do,
so
you
might
as
well
just
throw
a
label
on
it,
reasonable
or
not,
and
leave
it
alone.
how
do
you
answer
that
argument,
because
that's
the
essence
of
their
--
of
their
belief--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
this
bottom
line
allocation
is
always
going
to
be
wrong
somehow.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
in
those
proceedings,
are
witnesses
called
or
is
it
usually
done
on
papers?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
move
the
microphone
so
it's
a
little
closer
to
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
thank
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
ms.
anders,
could
you
please
finish
your
response,
when
you
said
various
states
do
various
things.
could
you
describe
some
of
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
states
have
north
carolina's
rule?
do
you
know?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
--
what
do
we
do
with
the
federal
statute
that
says,
you
are
not
entitled
to
a
lien
of
any
amount
that
is
greater
than
your
medical
expenses?
and
using
the
solicitor
general's
office
example,
everybody
knows
that
the
true
value
of
medical
expenses
in
a
particular
case
was
only
10
percent,
you
are
still
getting
30
percent.
how
do
we
--
how
do
we
honor
the
terms
of
the
federal
statute?
