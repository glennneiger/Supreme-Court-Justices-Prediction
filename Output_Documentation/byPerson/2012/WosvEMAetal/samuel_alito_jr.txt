justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
this
case
is
tried
to
a
verdict
and
there
is
a
special
verdict
and
the
jury
says
that
10
percent
was
medical
expenses?
the
statute
would
override
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
ahlborn,
where
you
have
--
where
the
state
has
agreed
that
a
certain
amount
is
attributable
for
medical
expenses,
and
then
this
hypothetical
that
the
jury
has
determined
that
a
certain
amount
constitutes
medical
expenses?
what's
the
difference
between
those
two?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
the
reasoning
of
ahlborn
that
when
we
know
to
a
certainty
how
much
the
medical
expenses
were
and
what
--
what
part
of
the
judgment
this
represents
or
the
settlement
represents
medical
expenses,
then
only
that
much
can
be
assigned
to
the
government?
and
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
that
and
the
verdict
situation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
how
often
this
comes
up
in
north
carolina?
do
you
have
any
figures
where
you
have
a
dispute
of
this
nature,
during
the
course
of
a
year?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
how
is
this
allocation
not
happening?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
this
is
what
i
envision
happening,
if
the
--
if
the
parties
can't
--
if
the
state
and
the
--
and
the
recipient
of
the
--
of
medicaid
assistance
can't
come
to
an
agreement.
basically,
you
have
to
make
an
estimate
of
what
the
damages
would
have
been
if
the
case
had
been
tried
and
then
you
determine
that
the
medical
portion
of
the
damages
would
have
been
15
percent
and
so
you
reduce,
then
you
take
the
amount
of
the
settlement,
and
the
amount
of
the
settlement
that
is
attributable
to
the
medical
expenses
is
15
percent.
that
would
be
what
i
would
envision.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
seems
very
--
that
seems
really
very
complicated.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
a
judge
--
where
the
case
is
settled
and
the
judge
doesn't
really
know
anything
about
the
proof,
how
is
a
judge
going
to
be
in
a
position
really
to
do
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
i
ask
you
a
question
on
this
different
point?
could
the
--
suppose
the
north
carolina
legislature
passed
a
statute
that
says
something
like
the
following:
"in
any
tort
action
in
which
an
item
of
damages
sought
is
medical
expenses,
the
plaintiff
may
not
recover
for
any
other
item
of
damages
until
the
full
amount
of
the
medical
expenses
is
satisfied.
"
now,
then
they're
just
restructuring
their
tort
law.
would
there
be
a
problem
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
does
federal
law
--
did
federal
law
require
your
client
to
seek
compensation
for
medical
expenses?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
could
have
--
could
you
have
filed
suit
and
disclaimed
any
--
any
claim
for
medical
expenses,
you
only
want
to
be
compensated
for
other
things?
