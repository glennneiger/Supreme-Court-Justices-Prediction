mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
--
general
maddrey
has
steadfastly
argued
that
the
north
carolina
statute
overrides
a
jury
verdict.
i
think
his
argument
is
well-grounded,
given
the
language
of
the
statute,
but
that
illustrates
the
very
problem
here,
that
this
statute
takes
one-third
of
a
settlement
or
judgment
regardless
of
the
true
facts
of
the
case.
and
that
is
problematic
under
ahlborn.
justice
kagan,
you
had
asked
mr.
--
general
maddrey
about
the
basis
for
the
north
carolina
statute.
general
maddrey
had
referred
to
it
being
a
rule
of
thumb
of
three
times
medicals.
but
if
you
actually
turn
to
the
fourth
circuit's
decision,
which
is
based
on
the
briefs
that
were
filed
in
the
fourth
circuit,
in
the
petition
at
page
20a,
the
rule
of
thumb
is
actually
three
times
specials,
which
of
course
is
different
than
three
times
medicals,
because
special
damages
would
include
things
like
lost
wages
and
various
other
things.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
would
turn
to
the
language
of
the
ahlborn
decision
which
makes
clear
that
states
cannot
lay
claim
to
more
than
a
portion
of
a
settlement
or
judgment
that
represents
payment
for
medical
care
or
medical
expenses.
when
you
have--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--it
is
the
state
saying
it
is
one-third
even
though
there
is
no
basis
and
even
though
you
have
cases
like
this
where
it's
clearly
not
one-third--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
that
is
all
north
carolina
had
to
do,
of
course,
the
ahlborn
decision
would
have
been
dramatically
different
if
arkansas
had
simply
enacted
a
cap
of
100
percent
or
50
percent
or
40
percent,
because
in
the
ahlborn
decision,
the
state
of
arkansas
was
only
seeking
to
recover
39
percent
of
the
tort
settlement.
and
under
north
carolina's
theory,
if
arkansas
had
simply
been
bright
enough
to
implement
a
cap,
the
ahlborn
decision
would
have
been
completely
different.
and
that
makes
absolutely
no
sense.
i
think
the
ahlborn
decision
indicates
that
there
has
to
be
a
process
in
order
to
fairly
and
appropriately
determine
the
amount
that
the
state
may--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it
is
very
easy
for
states
to
follow
that
and
to
put
in
practices
or
procedures
that
result
in
appropriate
allocation
of
medical
expenses.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes.
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
that
states
can
do
it.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
absolutely.
16
and
the
district
of
columbia
have
a
process
for
appropriate
adjudication.
moreover,
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
if
a
state
wants
to
have
a
presumption.
the
problem
is
it
can't
be
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
first
can
turn
to
your
point
and
then
respond
to
justice
breyer's
question.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
well,
let
me
say
this
at
the
outset:
that
first
of
all,
it
is
our
position
that
the
parties
simply
can't
stipulate
or
reach
an
agreement
that
somehow
deprives
the
state
of
their
interest.
there
has
to
be
an
appropriate
adjudication.
it's
worked
well
in
the
states
that
have
implemented
this
process.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
it's
all
of
that
complicated.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
what
should
be
adjudicated--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--what
should
be
adjudicated
consistent
with
the
ahlborn
decision
is
the
portion
of
the
settlement
that
represents
payment
for
medical
expenses.
and
that,
that
is--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
think--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--we
would
not
assert
that
the
parties'
subjective
belief
is
necessarily
binding.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
and
in
most
of
those--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--how
it
really
works
in
those
states
is
the
states
will
generally
negotiate
with
the
state
medicaid
agency
and
come
to
a
fair
allocation
without
the
necessity
for
a
judicial
determination
that's
appropriate.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
exactly,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
it
levels
the
playing
field
so
that
there
is
an
incentive
on
both
sides
to
come
to
an
appropriate
allocation.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
it
is
a
process
that
the
courts
can
determine
based
upon
the
experience
of
the
judge,
who
generally
would
be
very
experienced
in
the
valuation
of
cases,
can
make
an
appropriate
decision,
and
can
consider
all
the
facts,
the
equities--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--oh,
absolutely.
they
do
it
in
north
carolina
in
the
context
of
workers'
compensation
liens,
having
to
come
up
with
an
appropriate
allocation,
and
there
the
court
has--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--justice
sotomayor,
the
--
the
concern,
of
course,
is
that
--
forgive
me,
i've
lost
my
train
of
thought
here,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
that
is
--
that
is
certainly
an
approach
similar
to
ahlborn,
a
proportionality
sort
of
review.
you
--
you
--
you
look
at
how
much
you're
able
to
recover
versus
the
amount
--
the
amount
of
the
total
claim
versus
the
amount
of
the
settlement
and
you
come
to
an
appropriate--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--well--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
it
is
a
matter
of
the
parties
coming
forward,
presenting
evidence
as
to
the
damages
in
the
case,
perhaps
an
explanation
as
to
why
the
case
settled
for
less
than
full
value,
and
the
court
using
their
experience
to
determine
is
this
appropriate,
should
there
be
any
reductions
and
of
course--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--yes,
in
the
context
of
third-party
liability.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
statute
--
the
north
carolina
statute
directs
in
--
in
that
lien
situation
for
the
court
to
consider
the
likelihood
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
actually
recovered
on
the
claim,
and
various
other
factors
that
the
court
deems
appropriate
and
it
puts
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
court.
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
ahlborn
requires
that
there
must
be
a
determination
of
the
portion
of
the
settlement
that
represents
payment
for
medical--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--it's
usually
done
in
a
fairly
expedited
process,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
i
think
it
needs
to
be--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
an
objective
determination.
i
don't
think
the
parties
can
skew
it
one
way
because
of
the
way
they
structured
the
settlement
just
because
--
just
as
the
state
can't
skew
it
the
other
way
because
they
have
an
arbitrary
number,
whether
it
be
100
percent,
90
percent,
75
percent,
it
doesn't
allow
for
the
fact
that--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
a
rule
that
creates
a
presumption.
what
is
the
problem
is,
you
have
cases
that
are
on
the
extremes
like
this
case
where
you
have
absolutely
horrendous
injuries
and
a
physician
who
doesn't
have
the
financial
wherewithal
to
pay
for
the
extent
of
the
damages
that
he
caused.
here,
ema's
guardian
had
no
option
but
to
settle
the
case
for
the
available
funds
of
$2.8
million.
but
that
is
a
far
cry
from
how
anyone
would
objectively
evaluate--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
certainly
think
in
this
case
the
fact
that
the
united
states
department
of
health
and
human
services
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
that
points
out
that
this
sort
of
ill
rebuttable
presumption,
this
sort
of--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
give
chevron
deference
to
the
arguments
of
the
united
states--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
the
starting
point
has
to
be
the
federal
statute,
medicaid's
anti-lien
provision,
which
is
very
clear
that
no
lien
may
be
imposed.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
they
took
the
opposite
position.
with
regard
to
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
congressman
coble
that
that
was
a
--
an
employee
who
was
not
within
a
policymaking
decision,
who
has
to
field
thousands
of
these
sort
of
requests
for
information
coming
into
cms.
so
i
don't
think
we
can
put
a
whole
lot
of
credence
on
that
particular
letter
that
has
been
expressly
disavowed
by
the
secretary
and
the
director
of
cms.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
anti-lien
provision,
that
that
would
effectively
circumvent
the
anti-lien
provision
and
allow
by
the
backdoor
what
we
would
contend
would
not
be
--
the
state
could
not
do
directly.
so
yes,
i
do
see
potential
problems
with
that.
obviously,
it
would
be
different
than
the
scenario
that
we
have
here,
but
it
does
--
the
starting
point
has
to
be
the
anti-lien
provision,
which
is
no
lien
may
be
imposed.
this
court
in
ahlborn
assumed
without
deciding
that
there
would
be
an
implied
exception
to
that
statute.
but
that
--
that
exception
is
very
limited.
it
has
to
be
in
the
context
of,
as
this
court
recognized,
a
state
can
only
lay
claim
to
that
portion
of
the
settlement
that
represents
payment
for
medical
care.
so
until
you
have--
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
requirement
that
medicaid
beneficiaries
would
have
to
file
a
suit
and
try
to
recover
medical
expenses.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
if
--
first
of
all,
there
would
be
some
medical
expenses
that
wouldn't
be
medicaid,
medical
expenses
that
were
incurred
by
the
family.
but
moreover,
even
in
that
scenario,
i
think
given
the
language
of
the
north
carolina
statute,
the
state
would
still
be
seeking
one-third.
so,
if
one
were
to
take
that
route,
it
would
be
an
extremely
treacherous
route
that
you
be
--
would
be
not
being
able
to
--
to
get
full
--
full
recovery
from
the
defendant
but
still
having
to
be
paying
a
third
to
the
state
of
north
carolina.
mr.
christopher
g.
browning,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
gaming
of
the
system,
justice
scalia,
if
the
state,
based
upon
the
statute,
based
upon
its
previous
directives
would
expect
the
medicaid
beneficiary
to
seek
recovery
of
those
claims
and
to
remit
one-third
to
the
state.
thank
you,
your
honor.
