mr.
john
f.
maddrey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
medicaid
act
requires
states
to
take
reasonable
measures
to
seek
reimbursement
from
liable
third
parties
and
that
states
require
recipients
to
assign
their
rights
for
--
to
payment
for
medical
care.
the
act
does
not
direct
how
a
state
must
determine
what
portion
of
a
recipient's
third-party
recovery
is
properly
attributable
to
past
medical
expenses.
north
carolina's
procedure
establishes--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--excuse
me?
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
justice
sotomayor,
the
answer
to
that
depends
on
whether
the
state
has
to
predict
with
certainty
the
amount--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
the
--
the
statute
doesn't
predict;
it
defines.
it
tells
the
recipient
how
much
out
of
recovery
they
must
allocate
to
satisfy
the
repayment
obligation.
if
it
were
a
prediction,
that
would
make
it
a
presumption
and
you
would
have
to
defend
it
as
such.
but
here
the
statute
defines
the
portion
that
the
state,
as
a
condition
of
extending
the
medicaid
benefits,
tells
the
recipient
they
must
allocate--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
the
state
is
saying
that
as
to
the
amount
of
medicaid
benefits
provided,
the
state
has
the
right
of
recovery.
and
it
says
that
of
any
third
party--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--the
state
has
the
right
to
recover
that
portion.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
and
--
yes,
your
honor,
the
position
would
be
there
is
no
property
right
in
that
--
in
that
percentage
that
the
state
has
conditioned
the
extension
of
benefits
on.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
if
those
--
if
those
litigants
are
medicaid
recipients,
it
applies
to
them
as
a
condition
of
having
received
the
state
medicaid
benefits.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
as
a--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
i'm
--
i'm
confused
by
the
question.
i
was--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--i
don't
know
how
you'd
sue
for
something
you
don't
have
a
property
interest
in,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
the
inner--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--the
--
the
30
percent
attaches
upon
the
recovery
from
a
third
party.
the
--
the
cause
of
action
is
for
whatever
sources
of
injury
that
individual
would
have.
to
the
extent
the
recovery
is
for
medical
expenses
previously
paid
for
by
medicaid,
that's
what
the
state's
interest
could--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
your
honor,
the
stipulation
must
include
the
state
as
a
party
to
it
for
it
to
be
binding.
that's--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--there
could
be
an
advance
agreement,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--if
the
parties
are
private
litigants,
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant
in
a
medical
malpractice
action,
their
--
their
stipulation
doesn't
bind
the
state.
all
parties
to
this
case
agree
that--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
the
statutory
percentage
applies
in
that
situation
as
well.
the
33
percent
cap
would
apply.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
again,
the
state's
interest
is
the
amount
of
the
medicaid
benefits
it
provided,
capped
at
33
percent
of
the
recovery.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
first
enacted
it
as
it
relates
to
medicaid
in
1988.
it
reflects
a
legislative
history
in
north
carolina
going
back
to
1935
with
a
--
a
statutory
lien
applicable
to
medical
providers
in
--
in
civil
actions.
it
became
specifically
applicable
to
medicaid
scenario
in
the
1988
provision.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
your
honor,
i
believe
the
judge
imposing
judgment
following
that
jury
verdict
would
have
to
conform
the
verdict
to
the
law.
just
as
if
the
verdict
had
said,
there
was
100
--
excuse
me,
$1
million
in
punitive
damages
when
there
is
a
statutory
cap
of
$500,000
for
punitive
damages,
the
judge
would
have
to
conform
the
verdict
to
the
applicable
law.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
in
the
jury
verdict
scenario,
the
state's
not
a
party
to
that
and
didn't
commit
to
the
--
to
the
portion
that
--
that
was
attributable
to
medical
expenses.
the
jury
doesn't
have
any
authority
to
countervene
the
statute,
to
enter
a
verdict
in
violation
of
--
of
the
statutory
requirement.
and
here
the
statute
tells
the
medicaid
recipient
in
advance
how
much
of
any
recovery,
whether
that
be
from
a
settlement
or
a
verdict,
has
to
be
allocated
and
paid
back
to
the
state.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
the
verdict
situation
would
depend
upon
what
--
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
parties
to
the
lawsuit,
what
evidence
was
presented,
what
--
what
theories
were
advanced.
the
state
would
not
have
any
control
over
that.
it
would
be--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--the
state
can
initiate
a
lawsuit
on
behalf
of
its
--
its
medical
claim
by
virtue
of
the
subrogation
and
the
assignment
of
the
right.
it
could
participate
in
advance
or
it
could
participate
afterwards.
but
that
doesn't
come
without
costs,
because,
of
course,
if
the
state
participates
on
its
own
in
advance,
it
would
be
for
the
full
amount
of
the
medical
payments.
here--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--here
1.9
million,
and
the
33
percent
cap
would
have
no
application.
that
applies
only
to
amounts
recovered
by
a
recipient
from
a
third
party.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
your
honor,
historically
33
percent
or
three
times
the
medicals
was
the
--
the
rule
of
thumb
used
in
tort
actions
that
--
that
parties
used
that
as
the
methodology,
the
way
to
come
up
with
a
value
to
the
case,
with
the
theory
being
33
percent
for
the
medicals,
33
percent
for
attorneys'
fees
and
33
percent
to
the
victim.
that
was
the
underlying--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--historically
it
does.
it's
been
the
policy
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
for
almost
a
century,
as
i
referenced
the
lien
statutes
that
apply
generally
to
--
to
tort
actions,
to
civil
recoveries,
to
protect
the
providers
of
medical
services,
and
those
cases
date
back
to
1935.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
your
honor,
the
statute
applies
to
settlements
or
judgments
received
by
a
medicaid
recipient
from
a
third
party.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
the
andrews
case
said--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--said
that
the
key
point
in
ahlborn
was
the
stipulation--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
case.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
i
would
agree,
justice
ginsburg.
the
statute--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--exactly.
as
we
said,
he
would
either
have
to
conform
the
jury
verdict
to
the--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
it
would
--
it
would
depend
how
the
state
could
rationally
defend
their
statute
under
their
experience
as
consistent
with
their
jurisprudence.
of
course,
tort
law
being
primarily
the
province
of--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
i
don't
have
any
evidence
as
to
the
specific
performance
in
those
16
states.
that
would
leave
34
states
that
don't
have
one.
it
would
also
would
raise
the
question
of
how
many
of
those
states
--
i
believe
the
16
states
were
the
ones
that
had
some
sort
of
procedure,
some
post-settlement
either
hearing
or
trial
to
allocate--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--this
statute
dates
back
to
1988.
prior
to
1988
i
don't
know
how
from
the
1965
effective
date
of
medicaid
how
things
were
handled.
but
certainly
for
the
last--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--certainly
a
statute
could
be
amended.
whether
it
could
be
defended
under
--
under
the
circumstances--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--two-part
answer,
your
honor.
as
to
the
anti-lien
provision
of
the
medicaid
act,
if
the
statute
defines
the
amount
of
medicals
as
230
--
excuse
me
--
two-thirds,
that
would
present
the
same
analysis
under
the
anti-lien
provision
of
the
medicaid
act.
the
difference
would
be
whether
the
state
could
show
a
rational
basis
in
its
tort
law,
in
its
jurisprudence.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
i
would
say,
justice
kagan,
the
reason
it's
not
the
same
is
that
it
would
treat
medicaid
recipients
decidedly
differently
than
other
tort
litigants
in
north
carolina.
given
the
1935
history
of
the
allocation
of
--
of
tort
settlements
and
the
liens
in
favor
of
the
providers
of
medical
care
that
preexist
the
north
carolina
medicaid
statute,
if
you
then
change
the
medicaid
statute--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--i
--
i
believe
that
would
be
the
case,
yes.
the
--
the
question
would
be
whether
there
was
any
disparate
treatment,
any
singling
out
of
--
of
a
medicaid
recipient.
and
certainly,
we've
demonstrated
that
under
the
--
the
north
carolina
experience,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
i
--
i
believe,
your
honor,
in
response
to
the
90
percent
or
100
percent
scenario
or
hypothetical,
i
would
certainly
posit
it
would
be
difficult
for
a
state
to
defend--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
under
the
general
lien
statutes
in
chapter
44
of
the
north
carolina
general
statutes,
sections
49
and
50
are
the
two
provisions
that
we
cite.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
takings-related
challenges
to
those
laws.
i
am
aware
of
state
supreme
court
opinions
saying
that
the
attorney
had
to
distribute
proceeds
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
try
--
try,
if
i
can,
to
explain
what
i
believe
to
be
the
source
of
the
confusion
is.
the
stipulation
in
ahlborn
referenced
in
the
andrews
decision
was
between
the
medicaid
recipient
and
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
lienholder.
it
came
in
the
federal
court
action
to
challenge
arkansas's
imposition
of
its
lien.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
therefore,
there
was
a
stipulation
binding
the
state,
the
lienholder,
that
controlled
in
ahlborn.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
i
think
later
in
the
andrews
decision,
you
will
see
a
reference
to
the
parties
certainly
had
the
opportunity
to
negotiate
with
the
state
a
lesser
amount
than
--
that
the
amount
of
the
statutory
lien.
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
the
prior
determination,
i
believe.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
your
honor,
when
there's
a
lump
sum
settlement
in
--
in
these,
the
court
directs
the
attorney
for
the
recipient
to
enforce
the
statute
to
protect
the
state--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--here,
the
state
court
ordered
the
$933,000--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
they
have
to
enter
a
judgment,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
is
the
rationale
behind
the
statute
that
the
jury,
nor
the
judge,
can
enter
a
judgment
that's
not
in
conformity
with
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
your
honor,
i've
tried
in
the
briefs
to
indicate
the
dollar
amounts
involved.
the
numbers
of
cases
are
in
the
hundreds,
it's
my
understanding,
because
typically
they
involve
third-party
payments,
not
just
for
medical
malpractice
cases,
but
insurance
coverage
and
other
situations
that
trigger
the
repayment
obligation.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
well,
certainly,
that--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
i
think
they
were
saying
two
things.
other
states
have
different
procedures--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--and
that
in
north
carolina,
this
is
the
rule,
and
that
the
prior
determination
also
could
include
an
action
involving
binding
the
state
of
north
carolina.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
know--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--your
honor,
the
holding
in
ahlborn
said
you
can't
go
beyond
the
amount
represented
--
that
represents
repayment
for
medicals.
it
didn't
say
how
a
state
has
to
or
could
determine
that,
and
that's
the
question
that's
presented.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--absolutely--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--not
that
i'm
aware
of.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
we
have
heard
a
lot
about
what
a
state
could
or
maybe
should
do,
but
what
must
a
state
do
under
the
medicaid
act
to
fulfill
its
obligations?
the
fourth
circuit
and
respondents
and
apparently
the
united
states
say
they
have
to
have
a
post-settlement
trial,
i
guess
a
trial
to
settle
the
settlement.
and
that,
while
an
available
option,
is
not
a
mandatory
requirement
under
anything
that
i
can
see
in
the
medicaid
act.
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
your
honor,
the
statute
--
north
carolina's
statute
defines
the
amount
that
must
be
included
for
the
repayment
by
the
medicaid
recipient.
it's
not
guessing
after
the
fact,
but
instead
providing
in
advance,
the
recipe
as
to
how
to
put
the
settlement
together.
it
tells
the
parties
what
they
have
to
do.
and
that
makes
it
a
bright-line
rule,
which
i
think
you
need
to
compare
to
the
alternative,
which
is
this
--
this,
what
the
fourth
circuit
called
a
true
value
hearing
after
the
fact,
after
the
settlement,
how
did
--
how
did
they
get
there?
is
it
what
they
did
or
what
they
should
have
done
or
what
they
could
have
done?
in
this
case
you've
got
a
$42
million
damage
claim
settled
for
2.8
million--
mr.
john
f.
maddrey
--because
the
state
statute
says
the
state
never
recovers
more
than
its
actual
medical
expenses.
if
in
that
hypothetical
the
medical
expenses
were
100,000
or
10
percent,
the
north
carolina
statute
would
say
north
carolina
gets
up
to
one-third
of
the
settlement
but
never
more
than
they
paid.
so
by
definition
it
can't
be
for
something
that
was
not
medicals.
and
that's
the
bright-line
rule
that
the
north
carolina
statute
creates.
