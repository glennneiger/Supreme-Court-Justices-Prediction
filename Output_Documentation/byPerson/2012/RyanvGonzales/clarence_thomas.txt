ryan
versus
gonzales
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
tibbals
versus
carter
comes
to
us
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
the
first
case,
ryan
versus
gonzales,
valencia
gonzales,
a
death
row
inmate
in
arizona,
sought
federal
habeas
relief.
his
counsel
moved
to
stay
the
proceedings
on
the
grounds
that
gonzales
was
mentally
incompetent
and
that
his
incompetence
prevented
him
from
rationally
communicating
with
or
assisting
counsel.
the
district
court
denied
a
stay
finding
that
the
claims
before
it
were
record-based
on
resolvable
as
a
matter
of
law
and
thus,
would
not
benefit
from
gonzales'
input.
gonzales
then
sought
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
ninth
circuit
applied
its
recent
decisions
in
nash
versus
ryan
and
rohan
versus
woodford,
and
concluded
that
section
3599
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
gave
gonzales
the
right
to
stay
pending
competency
proceedings.
in
the
second
case,
tibbals
versus
carter,
sean
carter,
death
row
inmate
in
ohio,
likewise
initiated
federal
habeas
proceedings
but
eventually
moved
for
competency
determination
and
a
stay
of
proceedings.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
because
it
found
carter
incompetent
to
assist
counsel.
relying
on
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
rohan,
the
court
determined
that
carter's
assistance
was
needed
in
order
to
develop
four
of
his
claims.
it
thus
dismissed
as
habeas
petition
without
prejudice
and
perspectively
told
statute
of
limitations.
on
appeal
to
sixth
circuit
relying
in
part
on
our
decision
in
rees
versus
peyton
found
a
statutory
right
to
competence
in
section
4241
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code
which
provides
a
mechanism
for
competency
determinations
in
certain
situations.
it
thus
ordered
that
carter's
petition
be
stayed
indefinitely
with
respect
to
any
claims
requiring
his
assistance.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
in
both
cases.
the
ninth
circuit
located
a
right
to
competency
in
section
3599,
which
grants
federal
habeas
petitioners
on
death
row,
the
right
to
federally
funded
counsel,
but
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute
provides
habeas
petitioners
with
the
right
to
stay
of
proceedings
when
they
are
found
to
be
incompetent.
furthermore,
we
have
never
held
that
a
right
to
competence
is
a
component
of
the
right
to
counsel.
we,
therefore,
will
not
assume
that
congress
embedded
a
right
to
competency-based
stays
within
section
3599's
right
to
counsel.
the
ninth
circuit
first
identified
the
right
to
competency-based
stays
in
rohan,
concluding
there
that
a
petitioner's
mental
incompetence
could
have
eviscerate
the
statutory
right
to
counsel
in
federal
habeas
proceedings.
but
given
the
backward
looking
record-based
nature
of
section
2254
proceedings,
counsel
can
generally
provide
effective
assistance
to
a
habeas
petitioner
regardless
of
the
petitioner's
competence.
moreover,
our
decision
in
rees
versus
paton,
which
involved
an
incompetent
death
row
inmate's
attempt
to
withdraw
his
petition
for
certiorari
offers
no
support
for
gonzales'
position
because
rees
did
not
so
much
as
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
statutory
right
to
competence,
much
less
hold
that
such
a
right
exist.
the
sixth
circuit's
approach
is
similarly
incorrect.
section
4241
does
not
provide
a
statutory
right
to
stay
of
federal
habeas
proceedings
based
on
a
petitioner's
incompetence.
the
sixth
circuit
based
its
holding
largely
on
a
misreading
of
our
decision
in
rees,
which
as
noted,
did
not
recognize
such
a
right.
moreover,
section
4241
does
not
apply
to
federal
habeas
proceedings.
by
its
own
terms,
it
applies
only
to
federal
trial
proceedings
before
sentencing
and
“at
anytime
after
the
commencement
of
probation
or
supervised
release.”
federal
habeas
proceedings
fall
into
neither
of
these
categories.
as
part
of
their
inherent
power
to
manage
their
dockets,
district
courts
ordinarily
have
the
authority
to
issue
stays
where
a
stay
would
be
a
proper
exercise
of
discretion.
we
hold
that
a
stay
is
generally
unwarranted
however
when
a
petitioner
raises
only
record-based
claims
subject
to
review
under
section
2254(d),
because
counsel
may
present
such
claims
regardless
of
the
petitioner's
competence.
we
also
hold
that
indefinite
stays
are
inappropriate
because
they
frustrate
the
state's
attempts
to
defend
their
presumptively
valid
judgments.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
