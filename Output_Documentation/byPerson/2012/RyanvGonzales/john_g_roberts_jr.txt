chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
now
hear
argument
in
case
10-930,
ryan
v.
gonzales.
general
horne.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
treatment
begins
after
some
sort
of
initial
hearing,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
it
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
nit-picking,
but
why
is
it
six
to
nine
months?
eight
months
--
i
mean,
why
isn't
it
six
months?
or
nine
months?
i
don't
understand
why
there's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--so
six
months?
or
nine
months?
why
does
it
need
to
be
six
to
nine
months?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
shortly
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
i
thought
you
were
saying
after
a
year.
i
think
it's
--
it's
some
guidance
to
say
no
more
than
a
year.
it's
really
no
guidance
to
say
after
a
reasonable
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
standard
when
the
district
court
is
deciding
whether
to
stay
the
proceedings?
we've
heard
a
number
of
them,
plausible
basis
in
the
record,
truly
plausible,
iqbal.
which
--
which
--
what
is
the
government's
position
on
the
appropriate
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
standard
is
“
could
provide
”?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
mean
--
you
are
not
suggesting
that
don't
abuse
your
discretion
is
a
limit,
are
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
marquez.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel?
i'm
sorry--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
--
if
we
think
it's
necessary
to
set
some
objective
limit
on
how
long
an
inherent
authority
could
be
exercised,
is
there
any
reason
to
adopt
any
limit
other
than
the
one
that
the
psychiatrists
have
suggested,
which
is,
i
gather,
most
people,
if
they're
going
to,
will
recover
competence
within
9
months?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we're
looking
for
a
little
more
guidance
than
that,
and
feel
the
need
for
an
objective
standard
other
than
abuse
of
discretion,
you
don't
have
any
number
that
has
any
basis
in
psychiatric
evidence,
or
anything
else,
besides
the
9
months?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
nobody
here
thinks
today
--
no
one's
arguing
that
it
prevents
any
kind
of
stay
today,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
didn't
understand
--
i
thought
everybody
was
focusing
on
the
limitation
on
stays.
and
surely
aedpa
is
pertinent
when
it
comes
to
recognizing
the
need
for
those
limits,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so,
did
--
did
he
begin
treatment
prior
to
the
district
court
order
on
federal
habeas?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
so
how
--
what
is
this
nine
months
or
one
year?
is
that
the
amount
of
time
he's
under
treatment
or
the
amount
of
time
from
the
district
court
determination?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
horne,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general,
counsel.
the
two
cases
are
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-218,
tibbals
v.
carter.
ms.
schimmer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
understand
how
your
approach
works.
the
defendant,
the
habeas
petitioner,
the
allegation
is
made:
i'm
incompetent,
there
is
support
for
it.
the
district
court
says:
okay,
i
can't
enter
an
indefinite
stay,
but
you
are
going
to
be
treated;
i
want
you
to
come
back
in
6
months,
okay,
and
we
will
look
at
it
then.
he
comes
back
in
6
months,
and
there's
been
no
change.
what
happens
then?
another
6
months?
at
what
point
does
it
become
indefinite?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
give
me
a
loose
and
soft
rule.
i
mean,
is
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
it
two
years,
or
is
it
ten
years?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
michelman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
that
exactly.
what
--
what
prevents
them
from
picking
up
where
they
left
off?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
it's
adjudicated,
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
a
truly
suggested
by
the
record
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
well,
how
is
it
compared
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
it
more
stringent?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now
we've
gone
from
plausible
to
truly
--
plausible
--
well,
truly
suggested
by
the
record.
i
mean,
suggested
by
the
record
might
be
plausible.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
pretty
loose
standard
that
entitles
the
defendant
to
a
stay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
in
that
case,
the
whole
basis
of
the
analysis
was
that,
although
it
was
collateral,
it
really
was
the
first
opportunity
to
raise
a
particular
claim.
you
say
that,
earlier,
that
trial
judges
do
this
all
the
time
in
the
trial
context.
it's
an
important
distinction
in
our
jurisprudence
if
there's
difference
in
terms
of
the
rights
to
which
you
are
entitled
preconviction
and
post-conviction.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
your
--
what
is
your
limit?
you
think
there
is
no
limit
on
the
inherent
authority,
that
these
things
can
go
on
and
on?
or
as,
i
mean,
your
friend
on
the
other
side
suggested,
1
year
as
a
presumption?
do
you
have
any
limit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
did
you
say
that
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
not
whether
he
is
competent
today
to
assist
his
counsel,
but
whether
he
was
14
years
ago?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
in
the
world--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--right.
how
is
a
--
do
mental
health
professionals
make
those
determinations
on
a
regular
basis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
pretty
inefficient
system,
isn't
it,
that
a
judge
has
to
learn
a
particular
record
to
dispose
of
claims
1
through
9,
when
he
knows
that
he's
not
going
to
be
able
to
dispose
of
the
petition
until
the
petitioner
is
competent,
maybe
a
year
later,
then
he
has
to
go
through
the
whole
thing
again?
i
don't
see
a
district
court
saying,
"well,
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
this
until
i
can
dispose
of
the
whole
thing.
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
schimmer,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
no.
10-930,
ryan
vs.
gonzales
and
no.
11-218
tibbals
versus
carter.
