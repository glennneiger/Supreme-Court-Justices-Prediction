ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
from
the
sixth
circuit,
which
held
that
habeas
claims
can
be
stayed
indefinitely
because
prisoners
have
a
statutory
right
to
competence
to
assist
in
their
case,
but
even
mr.
carter
now
disowns
the
circuit's
rationale,
and
the
court's
indefinite
stay
order
was
wrong
for
two
other
reasons.
first,
habeas
claims
cannot
be
stayed
indefinitely.
doing
so
is
fundamentally
incompatible
with
the
timeliness
concerns
underlying
aedpa.
second,
while
we
readily
acknowledge
that
limited
stays
will
be
appropriate
in
some
situations,
this
is
not
one
of
them.
all
of
mr.
carter's
claims
are
record
based
and,
therefore,
resolvable
without
his
assistance.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
limited
stays,
we
think,
your
honor,
would
be
appropriate
in
situations
where
the
prisoner's
ability
to
effectively
communicate
with
his
counsel
or
to
disclose
evidence
would
be
necessary
to
his
claim.
and
we
think
that
would
be
true
in
a
case,
potentially,
where
aedpa
does
not
restrict
federal
review
to
the
state
court
record.
so
here,
for
instance,
we
think
that
the
prisoner's
assistance
would
not
be
necessary,
and,
therefore,
even
a
limited
stay
would
not
be
appropriate,
because
all
of
mr.
carter's
claims
were
vetted
before
the
state
courts
and
decided
on
the
merits.
and
therefore,
under
2254(d)
in
this
court's
decision
in
pinholster,
the
federal
court
is
limited
to
reviewing
the
state
court
record.
we
don't
think
that
the
prisoner's
assistance
in
that
case
is
necessary.
we
don't
think
mr.
carter
has
made
a
case
for
why
his
assistance
would
be
necessary
in
this
specific
case.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
well,
we
absolutely
agree,
justice
kennedy,
that
indefinite
stays
are
never
appropriate,
regardless
of
the
circumstances;
that
indefinite
stays
contravene
aedpa's
timeliness
concerns.
and
to
the
extent
that
all
of
the
parties
in
this
case
agree
now
that,
to
the
extent
district
courts
have
some
power
to
issue
stays
--
we
say
only
limited
stays
--
in
these
cases,
that
power
is
grounded
in
equitable
discretion.
and
we
do
not
think
that
it
comports
with
equitable
discretion
to
allow
a
prisoner
essentially
to
win
his
case,
to
obtain
a
suspension
of
his
capital
sentence,
the
ultimate
end
relief
that
he
seeks--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--we
think
in
those
situations,
certainly
the
state
of
ohio
wouldn't
contest,
for
instance,
under
2254(b),
that
if
you
were
incompetent
before,
that
that
would
be
a
legitimate
basis
potentially
for
not
having
been
able
to
reasonably
discover
a
new
claim,
if
one
had
a
new
claim.
so
we
do
think
that
moving
forward,
that
no
indefinite
stay
should
be
permitted.
and
when
the
courts
move
forward,
yes,
if
someone's
competency
is
later
restored,
there
are
backstops.
the
person,
certainly
in
ohio,
can
always
go
back
to
state
court--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--the
backstop
would
be
a
newly
discovered
claim,
i
would
say.
i
think
that
would
be
what--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--i
think
that's
right.
because
i
think,
to
the
extent
that
using
this
case
as
a
springboard,
the
court
could
draw
the
boundary
line
--
could
draw
one
bright
boundary
line
and
say
indefinite
stays
are
never
permitted,
but
limited
stays
might
be
permitted
in
cases
where
the
claims
are
not
record
based.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
oh.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
i
agree.
i
agree
with
you
that
the
court
could
rule
on
that
ground.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
that
is
true,
too.
that
is--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--that
is
true,
too--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--i
suppose,
yes.
i
mean,
we
would
urge
the
court
to,
i
think,
do
both,
to
say--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--that
is
not
our
argument,
justice
sotomayor.
our
--
our
definition
of
an
indefinite
stay
is
a
stay
that
is
imposed
until
the
prisoner
is
restored
to
competence.
that--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--like
the
stay
in
rees,
or,
really,
like
the
stay
the
sixth
circuit
has
issued.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
rees
really
has
any
force
or
provides
any
guidance
in
this
case.
that,
of
course,
was
a
case
where
a
prisoner
was
seeking
to
abandon
his
further
appeals.
there
are
multiple
reasons
why
we
think
that
rees
does
not
endorse
the
power
of
federal
courts
to
indefinitely
stay
habeas
proceedings.
one
is
the
fact
that
the
court's
stay
order
was
completely
unexplained
and
very
terse,
didn't
announce
any
rule
of
law.
second,
the
historical
record
shows
that
the
court's
stay
in
rees
was,
at
most,
a
judicially
negotiated
settlement,
meaning
far
from
a
demonstration
of
the
court's
inherent
power.
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
carefully
orchestrated
exercise
of
consented-to
power.
the
third
point
is
that--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--not
in
--
not
where
it's
appropriate,
no,
your
honor.
and
again,
your
honor,
our
definition
of
an
indefinite
stay
is--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--no.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
correct.
we
would
--
here's
how
we
would
taxonomize
the
appropriateness
of
stays.
we
would
say
indefinite
stays
are
never
permitted,
meaning
a
court
can
never
premise
a
stay
exclusively
on
the
restoration
of
the
prisoner's
competency,
in
saying
however
long
it
takes--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--if
a
doctor
says,
it
can
be
done,
we
have
to
try,
and
it's
a
situation
where
it's
appropriate--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--right.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
it
can
be
done.
we
would
say,
your
honor--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--right.
so
we
would
say
in
certain
situations,
yes,
that
would
be
perfectly
appropriate.
the
state
of
ohio
certainly
agrees
that
having
a
competent
prisoner
is
a
desirable
thing
in
a
habeas
case
and
that
courts
do
have
some
discretion
to
try
to
vindicate
that
goal.
our
point,
though,
is
simply
that
it
cannot
come
at
all
cost,
meaning--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--no.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
well,
the
court
--
the
court
in
the
end
held
up
the
cert
petition
for
several
decades
without
deciding
the
case.
and
in
the
end
mr.
rees
died
and
then
the
cert
petition
was
ultimately
later
dismissed.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
right.
well,
since
we
are
playing
on
the
field
of
equitable
discretion,
your
honor,
it's
going
to
be
difficult
to
put
forward
a
hard
and
fast
rule.
but
justice
sotomayor
rightly
points--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--sure.
a
loose
and
soft
rule.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
we
would
say
presumptively
a
year.
and
we
think
there
is
support
for
that,
even
from
mr.
carter's
own
amici.
the
brief
of
the
american
psychiatric
association,
pages
19
to
21,
and
especially
footnote
30,
talks
about
how
most
prisoners
who
are
ultimately
successfully
restored
to
competency,
that
does
happen
in
a
matter
of
months,
6
to
9
months
at
the
longest
end;
about
90
percent
of
them
are
restored
within
6
to
9
months.
so
we
think,
presumptively,
a
year
would
be
an
appropriate
period
of
time
for--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--well,
we
think,
your
honor,
at
the
point
at
which
you
say
that
the
test
for
a
limited
stay
is
however
long
it
takes
to
restore
somebody's
competency
is
the
point
at
which
we
have
returned
to
the
definition
of
saying
that
indefinite
stays
are
proper.
and
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
think
that--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--because
we
do
think
that
there
comes
a
point,
given
the
finality
concerns
underlying
aedpa,
that
a
limited
stay,
when
that
window
expires
--
the
person
has
a
reasonable
period
of
time
to
be
restored
to
competency;
that
when
that
window
expires,
at
some
point
the
proceedings
do
have
to
continue.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
and
to
the
extent
that
we
are
balancing
different
parties'
interests
in
these
cases,
after
the
preliminary
limited
stay
expires,
we
believe
at
that
point
the
prisoner's
interest
in
a
continued
stay
has
diminished,
and
the
state's
interest
in
the
proceedings
continuing
and
moving
forward
has
then
increased,
and
that
the
court
should
then
move
on.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
that
would
be
the
threshold
question,
and
there
seems
to
be
a
good
amount
of
consensus
on
that
point.
it's
the
test
articulated
by
the
sixth
and
ninth
circuits
and
by
my
colleague
here
today.
and
we're
willing
to
accept
that
as
the
test
for
when
limited
stays
can
be
imposed.
with
that,
if
there
aren't
further
questions
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
thank
you.
first
off,
are
there
is
nothing
narrow
about
what
the
sixth
circuit
held.
at
page
15-a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
sixth
circuit
ordered
that
all
of
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
be
stayed
until
mr.
carter
is
competent,
meaning
these
claims
will
be
stayed
at
any
and
all
cost
to
the
progress
and
finality
of
the
proceedings.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
we
think
there
are
a
few
values,
justice
sotomayor.
first
of
all
is
that
the
state
has
--
still
has
an
interest.
first
of
all,
we
don't
concede
mr.
carter
is
ford
incompetent.
those--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--putting
that
aside,
though,
the
state's
interest
is
that
it
still
has
this
powerful
interest
in
the
finality
of
its
conviction
and
sentence.
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
no.
but
even
if
the
implementation
of
that
sentence
is
ultimately
forestalled
by
a
ford
ruling,
that's
true
in
a
dignitary
sense,
but
it's
also
true
in
a
practical
sense,
meaning
the
state
should
not
--
if
somebody
gains
competence
many
years
down
the
line,
the
whole
point
of
aedpa
is
that
the
state
at
that
time
should
not
have
to
be
litigating
a
stale
case.
and
to
wait
potentially
5
and
10
and
15
years
until
someone's
competency
is
restored
on
this
total
speculation
that
something
might
happen--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--well,
again,
your
honor--
ms.
alexandra
t.
schimmer
--right.
well,
we
still
don't
see
how
that
has
any
traction
in
a
case
like
this
where,
whether
competent
or
not
competent,
2254(d)
and
pinholster
say
this
claim
--
all
of
these
claims
were
adjudicated
on
the
merits
in
state
court,
and,
therefore,
no
new
evidence
can
be
considered
by
the
federal
court.
so
that,
we
think,
resolves
that.
and
in
terms
of
how
you
deal
with
limited
stays
and
then
going
on,
we
would
say
simply
that
the
state
of
ohio's
experience
in
this
case
has
been
that
the
state
of
ohio
has
been
standing
ready
for
ten
years
to
defend
the
judgment
of
its
state
courts
in
this
case,
even
though
all
of
mr.
carter's
claims
are
record
based.
there
is
no
right
to
competence;
everybody
seems
to
agree
on
that.
indefinite
stay
has
contravened
aedpa,
and
we
don't
think
that
any
stay
is
justified
here
because
of
the
record-based
claims.
thank
you.
