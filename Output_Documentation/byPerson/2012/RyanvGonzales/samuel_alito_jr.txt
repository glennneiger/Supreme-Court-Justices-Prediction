justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
there
is
a
time
limit
--
if
there
is
a
time
limit
of
six
to
nine
months--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--at
what
point
does
it
begin
to
run?
does
it
begin
to
run
at
the
time
when
the
petitioner
moves
for
a
stay,
even
if
no
effort
was
made
prior
to
that
to
restore
the
petitioner
to
competency?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
but
my
question
is
this:
suppose
that
no
effort
has
been
made
by
counsel
to
provide
--
to
obtain
treatment
for
the
petitioner
to
restore
the
petitioner
to
competency
prior
to
the
point
when
a
motion
is
made
to
stay
the
proceeding.
the
six-to
month
period
would
still
begin
to
run
at
the
time
when
the
motion
for
the
stay
is
made,
or
would
it
begin
to
run
at
some
earlier
point
or
some
later
point?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
happens
if
after
9
months
mental
health
experts
come
in
and
they
say
there's
a
90
percent
chance
of
restoring
the
petitioner
to
competency
in
another
9
months
or
another
three
months
or
another
month.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
it's
not
limited
to
cases
where
the
review
is
restricted
to
the
record.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
there
--
if
the
court
were
to
point
to
some
guideline
as
to
the
maximum
length,
or
the
presumptive
maximum
length
of
a
stay,
what
--
because
that's
the
period
within
which
there's
a
good
chance
in
most
cases
of
restoring
a
petitioner
to
competency
--
at
what
point
would
that
begin
to
run?
would
there
be
any
obligation
to
begin
the
treatment
prior
to
the
--
to
the
time
when
the
motion
for
a
stay
is
--
is
filed?
could
many
years
go
by
with
the
same
attorney
representing
a
client,
and
then
at
the
very
last
minute
--
and
no
effort
is
made
to
obtain
treatment
that
would
restore
the
petitioner
to
competency,
and
then
at
the
very
last
minute,
a
motion
for
a
stay
is
entered,
and
then
this
period
of
time
--
6
months,
9
months,
a
year,
whatever
it
is
--
would
begin
to
run?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
here,
the
motion
--
when
was
the
motion
made,
the
motion
for
a
competency
determination
and
a
stay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
when
was
that?
do
you
remember
the
date,
roughly?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
when
was
the
initial
habeas
petition
filed
in
district
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
of
2000?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
why
wasn't
there
--
then
there
was
no
obligation
to
do
anything
between
2000
and
2006?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
was
only
after
6
years
of
being
unable
to
communicate
with
him
that
the
attorney
said
maybe
there's
a
competency
problem
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
is
it
your
position
that
any
time
a
petitioner
raises
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
the
habeas
proceeding
can
potentially
be
stayed
indefinitely?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
isn't
what
you're
proposing
just
a
mechanism
that
will
permit
stays
in
virtually
every
capital
case,
if
that's
what
the
petitioner
wants
--
if
that's
what
petitioner's
counsel
wants?
let's
say
you
have
a
case
where
there
is
a
small
amount
of
mitigating
evidence
about
the
petitioner's
childhood,
but
not
enough
to
sway
the
sentencing
authority.
it's
alleged
that
if
the
petitioner
had
been
--
if
the
petitioner
was
competent,
the
petitioner
could
provide
a
lot
more
information
about
what
went
on
during
his
childhood
years;
and,
therefore,
the
proceeding
has
to
be
stayed
indefinitely
until
the
petitioner
is
restored
to
competence
or
he
dies,
as
happened
in
rees.
what
do
you
do
with
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
if
the
district
court
says,
well,
there's
a
little
bit
here,
and
i
can't
rule
out
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
lot
more
that's
locked
in
the
petitioner's
mind,
but
he
is
unable
to
provide
it
because
he
is
incompetent,
then
i'm
going
to
grant
a
stay
until
he
is
restored
to
competence;
and,
then
that
would
be
insulated
from
being
overturned
on
appeal
by
abuse
of
discretion
standard;
that's
what
you're
arguing?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
is
consistent
with
aedpa;
that
congress,
knowing,
in
particular,
that
a
lot
of
district
judges
and
a
lot
of
court
of
appeals
judges
don't
like
the
death
penalty
and
will
go
to
some
length
to
prevent
the
imposition
of
that
sentence,
that
we're
just
going
to
leave
that
all
to
the
discretion
of
every
individual
district
judge?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
can't
the
competency
--
why
can't
the
issue
of
competency
at
trial
be
resolved?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
to
be
competent
during
the
habeas
proceeding
in
order
to
assist
in
proving
that
he
was
--
that
he
was
incompetent
at
the
time
of
trial?
