justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
the
--
it
might
be
unusual,
but
you
can't
try
a
person
who's
not
competent.
you
can't
try
him.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
about
--
and
now
he's
been
tried,
and
he's
been
convicted
and
been
appealed
and
gone
through
the
procedures.
but
some
case
could
arise
where,
in
habeas,
they
made
like
a
prima
facie
showing
or
a
--
convinced
the
judge
that
there
really
is
a
very
good
chance
here,
or
maybe
even
i
think
it's
probable
that
the
basic
trial
was
unfair,
to
the
point
where
it's
like
not
having
a
trial.
what
about
in
that
situation,
if
it
ever
arises?
i
mean,
should
we
leave
the
door
open
just
for
that
possibility?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
that.
that's
why
i
put
in
the
possibility
that
on
the
basis
of
what's
presented
to
me,
the
judge,
i
think
i
have
so
much
without
this
defendant's
testimony
here
suggesting
it
was
unfair,
that
maybe
the
presumption
should
shift
back.
that's
what's
worrying
me
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
that
there
could
be
such
a
case.
there
have
been
in
history.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
he
can't
do
if
he's
not
competent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean
--
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
it
in
that
particular
tone.
but
i
mean,
trial
judges
run
their
trials.
you
know,
that's
what
they're
hired
for.
and
once
we
make
it
clear,
it
shouldn't
go
on
forever,
and
why
can't
we
trust
them
to
do
their
job?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
shouldn't
be
indefinite.
the
object
of
this
is
you're
trying
to
give
--
like
you
would
with
any
witness
who's
not
around
at
the
moment,
you're
trying
to
produce
a
hearing
that
will
reach
a
result
with
this
witness.
and
if
you
think
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
that
witness
will
recover
and
be
available,
fine.
and
if
there
is
no
hope
of
that,
forget
it.
i
mean,
you
know,
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
we,
in
this
kind
of
case,
as
opposed
to,
say,
some
other
case
where
a
witness
is
missing
and
it's
crucial?
the
district
court
does
have
authority
to
grant
stays.
and
we
haven't
said,
but
no
longer
than
a
year.
why
do
we
say,
but
they
do
it
in
a
reasonable
time?
if
they
abuse
their
discretion,
there
is
mandamus,
or
there
are
other
ways
of
controlling
the
discretion.
why
are
we
suddenly
here,
in
this
case,
imposing
a
fixed
number
of
days?
i
mean,
the
reason,
of
course,
that
the
psychological
association
says
six
months
to
nine
months
is
they
have
different
studies.
in
some
places,
it's
six
months;
in
some
places,
it's
nine
months.
and
so
why
are
we
picking
a
number
out
of
a
hat
here
when
we
don't
elsewhere?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
should,
but
it
should
be
something
like
reasonable
or
don't
abuse
your
discretion
or
--
i
mean,
at
the
moment,
i'm
just
not
seeing
why
this
is
different
than
10,000
other
kinds
of
instances
where
we
set
that
kind
of
limit,
rather
than
days.
