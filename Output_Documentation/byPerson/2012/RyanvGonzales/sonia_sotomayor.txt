justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
tell
me
how
you
define
indefinite
stays,
meaning
are
you
okay
with
the
six
months
to
a
year
stay
for
a
court
to
try
to
get
someone
back
to
competence,
assuming
that
there
is
a
claim
in
which
the
defendant's
information
is
necessary?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
you
deal
with
justice
kagan's
earlier
question
of
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
person's
still
necessary
--
or
the
information,
potential
information
is
still
necessary,
what
makes
it
unnecessary
after
a
year?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
those
cases
didn't
establish
a
limit
on
how
long
states
needed
to
take
to
adjudicate
claims.
they
just
said
a
district
court
should
put
in
conditions
that
move
things
along--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
require
defendants
to
press
their
claims
within
a
reasonable
time
that
required
periodic
updates,
that
required
monitoring
by
the
court,
but
it
didn't
set
an
artificial
end
time.
it
just
said
you
can't
just
do
an
open-ended
stay
and
not
give
conditions
to
comply
with.
why
should
this
be
treated
differently?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
cap
it
by
saying
as
long
as
the
discretion
is
not
exercised
for
more
than
a
year.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
that
standard
have
been
met
in
both
of
these
cases?
meaning,
carter's
claim
--
and
the
one
that
concerns
me
the
most
is
why
he
was
excluded
from
trial,
and
what
if
he
did
or
did
not
do
with
his
attorneys
afterwards.
and
gonzales
is
a
slightly
different
case.
but
would
your
position
be
that
in
both
cases
there
was
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
my
question
was,
on
the
facts
of
both
of
these
cases,
was
there
a
basis
for
granting
the
stay
with
respect
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--their
conditions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
neither
carter
or
gonzales?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
is
that
you're
--
that
seems
like
almost
a
due
process
argument,
that
in
every
single
case
you
have
to
grant
a
stay.
you're
--
you're
parting
from
the
respondent
in
carter,
and
you
are
making
a
broader
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
incompetent
client,
presumably,
can
help
you
make
those
decisions.
so
tell
me,
are
you
saying
that
in
every
single
case,
the
client
is
entitled
to
a
stay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
does
that
situation
give
you
an
entitlement
if
it's
not
in
every
single
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
in
the
record
could
plausibly,
certainly
be
seen
that
would
suggest
that
your
defendant
has
information
that
could
be
valuable?
assume
it's
not
the
aba
standard,
but
the
plausibility
standard
or
the
certainty
standard
or
something.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
you
can
see
from
the
record.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
plausibly
give
rise
to
a
belief
that
there
was
some
ex
parte
exchange
between
the
judge
and
the
defendant?
is
there
anything
to
suggest
that
in
the
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
anything
to
suggest
that
there
had
been
an
ex
parte
exchange
that
would
account
for
that
snarling?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
in
this
case,
the
district
court
denied
a
stay.
if
this
is
an
equitable
power,
how
can
you
be
comfortable
that
the
ninth
circuit
as
an
appellate
court
overrode
the
district
court's
equitable
discretion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you're
not
claiming
that
that
issue
is
always
in
the
district
court's
hands
to
start
with.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
please
identify
for
me
what
--
how
we
establish
or
set
a
standard
so
that
appellate
courts
are
not
overriding
that
at
whim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
you're
flipping
it.
you're
saying
first
you
give
a
stay
for
competence.
you've
determined
competency
first
and
not
essentiality
first?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
million
dollar
question:
assume
we
say
you
have
to
spend
a
reasonable
time
trying
to
get
someone
to
competency.
and,
here,
there
appears
to
have
been
efforts
to
do
so.
and
your
client
is
saying,
i
can't
be
treated
because
the
drugs
make
me
sick.
so
when
does
all
of
this
end?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
time
has
passed
by
now,
hasn't
it?
that
that
--
they
stopped
treating
him?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
one's
continuing
to
monitor
him
or
trying
to
treat
him?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
a
little
confused
as
to--
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
so
that
treatment
could
be
had.
so
why
has
it
stopped?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
am
i
--
am
i
understanding
that
your
position
in
response
to
the
question
from
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
is
that
for
you,
indefinite
is
any
stay
whatsoever?
it
sounds
like
what
you
are
proposing,
or
in
response
to
them,
is
that
no
stay
for
purposes
of
determining
competence,
whether
it's
short
or
long,
is
permissible.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
could
take
objection
to
that
characterization,
because
the
clerk
of
the
court
told
the
court
that
neither
party
was
happy
with
what
was
happening,
and
the
court
still
entered
the
order.
but
let
me
go
back
to
my
question
a
moment.
amici
say
that
most
competency
issues
are
resolved
within
months
and
that
many
individuals,
the
vast
majority,
are
restored
to
competency
with
proper
medication
within
months.
are
you
opposing
those
kinds
of
stays?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
under
your
definition,
it's
never
appropriate,
really.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
argue
--
you
argue
two
things.
you
say,
under
pinholster,
courts
always
have
to
rely
on
the
record.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
though
a
doctor
says,
it
can
be
done,
we
have
to
try?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
they
can
never
say,
it
can
be
done.
they
can
say--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--we
have
to
try.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
also
--
i'm
not
sure
how
they
can
do
that
until
they
try.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
petitioner
says
they
won't
because
they
can
come
back
with
new
evidence
after
habeas
is
closed.
why
is
that
inadequate?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
presume
--
i
presume
that
the
one
claim
among
your
many
--
yours
is
the
defendant
who
was
excluded
from
trial,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
if
he
comes
back
and
says,
i
told
my
attorneys
i
would
behave,
and
i
wanted
to
come
back
earlier,
but
they
never
let
me
back
in,
this
would
not
be
a
new
claim,
this
would
be
part
of
the
old
claim
that
has
been
adjudicated,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
without
his
information.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that
you
could
see
from
the
record.
the
question
in
my
mind
would
be
whether
he
told
counsel
he
would
behave
and
counsel
ignored
that
information,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
tell
me
what
the
value
is
to
wait
for
the
ford
analysis
or
the
ford
examination
to
the
time
of
execution?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
putting
that
aside.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
“
at
all
costs
”
is
what
you
seem
to
be
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
your
adversary
has
not
said
it's
total
speculation.
he
suggests
that
if
we
set
a
standard
that
requires
--
we
can
talk
about
what
the
terms
are:
suggestive
in
the
record,
plausible
in
the
record,
typical
sort
of
situation
--
but
assuming
that
there
is
some
basis
to
believe
that
the
defendant
can
provide
information
of
importance
to
the
claim,
why
should
that
be
--
that
door
be
shut?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
how
do
you
deal
with
his
answer
that
if
the
claim
is
not
a
new
claim,
but
just
new
information
about
an
old
claim,
that
he
will
be
barred
from
a
successive
petition?
