justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
would
you
define
that
standard?
what
standard
do
you
suggest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
it
isn't
solved
after
nine
months,
then
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
competency
cannot
be
restored?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
based
on
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
he
under
duty
to
raise
it
as
soon
as
possible,
at
the
risk
of
forfeiture
if
he
doesn't?
that's
the
import
of
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
why
i'm
asking.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
--
why
shouldn't
the
rule
be
that
an
indefinite
stay
is
never
necessary;
you
just
proceed
based
on
the
evidence
you
have?
sometimes
we
have
evidence
where
a
witness
is
missing.
we
have
to
go
on
with
the
case.
then
it
could
be
open
to
argue
in
a
later
case
that
there
was
new
evidence
that
was
not
available.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
second
part
of
the
equation?
suppose
that
there's
no
stay,
that
the
habeas
proceeding
is
adjudicated
against
the
petitioner.
he
then
becomes
competent
and
claims
there's
new
evidence.
would
that
be
grounds
to
reopen,
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
the
backstop
be
newly
discovered
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
help
me
with
your
discussion
of
2244(b)?
i
have
it
in
front
of
me.
and
the
hypothetical
was
that
he's
incompetent,
his
claim
is
adjudicated,
then
he
becomes
competent,
and
he
says
now
there
is
some
new
evidence
which
could
not
have
been
discovered.
i
thought
you
told
us
that
you
not
only
have
to
have
new
evidence,
but
new
law.
that's
not
the
way
i
read--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--(b)(2)(b)(1),
unless
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
says,
"or
the
factual
predicate
for
the
claim
could
not
have
been
discovered
previously
through
the
exercise
of
due
diligence.
"
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
clear
and
convincing,
that's
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
--
but
then
you
are
fighting
the
arguendo
assumption.
let's
assume
that
the
ford
standard,
the
standard
for
competence
to
be
executed,
is
more
lenient,
less
--
less
forgiving
than
competence
to
assist
counsel.
let's
assume
that.
then
justice
scalia
has
to
be
right;
you've
simply
eliminated
the
ford
standard
altogether.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am
i
--
is
it
correct
that
the
petitioners
in
both
cases
--
pardon
me,
that
the
criminal
defendants
in
both
cases
here,
the
respondents,
have
all
but
conceded
that
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
the
right
to
competency
during
habeas,
or
am
i
overstating
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
once
you
concede
the
constitutional
point,
so
that
there's
no
fundamental
unfairness,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
all
but
given
away
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
fairness
that's
not
fundamental
--
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
unfairness
that's
not
fundamental.
