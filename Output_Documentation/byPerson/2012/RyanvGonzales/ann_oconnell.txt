ms.
ann
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
agrees
with
ohio
and
arizona
on
the
general
framework
for
when
no
stay
is
allowed
and
for
when
a
limited
stay
is
allowed
in
federal
post-conviction
proceedings.
i'd
like
to
provide
the
court
with
a
practical
example
of
how
a
limited
stay
might
work,
since
that
seems
to
have
been
of
some
concern.
an
analogous
federal
statute
is
18
u.s.c.
section
4241,
the
federal
competency
hearing
statute
that
the
court
cited
or
provided
a
cf
citation
to
in
rees.
that
provides
the
framework
for
how
a
district
court
determines
competency
for
a
prisoner
to
stand
trial
and
could
provide
a
framework
for
how
a
district
court
should
proceed
with
competency
hearings
in
a
case
where
it
would
be
appropriate.
under
section
4241
the
criminal
defendant,
if
he
is
found
incompetent,
the
district
court
may
give
an
initial
period
of
up
to
4
months
for
him
to
be
treated
to
determine
whether
he
can
come
back
to
competency.
if
he
cannot
regain
his
competency
at
the
end
of
that
4-month
period,
then
the
court
can
grant
an
additional
reasonable
extension
of
that
time
if
the
doctors
say
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
this
prisoner
can
be
restored
to
competence.
that
could
provide
a
framework,
if
that's
what
this
court
is
looking
to
do,
for
showing
district
courts
how
they
could
enter
a
limited
stay.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--i
think
we
agree
on
the
outer
end
that--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
but
this
is
what
district
courts
do.
they
do
it
whenever
a
competency
motion
is
filed
in
a
federal
criminal
trial,
and
we
agree
with
the
--
the
outside
limit
of
about
a
year.
it
depends
on
the
--
the
interests
at
stake,
the
interests
at
stake
in
the
state
in
proceeding
with
its
judgment
and
the
interests
in
finality
and
whether
the
doctors
think
that
there's
actually
a
chance
that
this
prisoner
could
be
restored
to
competence
if
they
work
a
little
harder.
if
the
--
if
the
evidence
is
crucial
or
necessary
or
there's
some
indication
that
we
want
to
work
hard
to
get
this
information
from
the
prisoner,
we
would
go
for
a
little
bit
longer.
but
at
some
point,
that
attempt
to
restore
the
prisoner
to
competency
has
to
end
and
the
--
and
the
proceedings
should
move
forward
based
on
the
best
evidence
that's
available.
ms.
ann
o'connell
there's
not.
but
--
but
at
some
point
we
do
give
up,
and
the
district
courts
have
discretion
to
determine
how
long
that
would
be,
and
--
and
again,
we
propose
an
outer
limit
of
about
a
year,
but
it's
up
to
the
district
court
in
that
particular
circumstance
to
see
how
hard
they
want
to
work
to
try
to
get
that
evidence
into
the
proceeding.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
the--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--no.
the
difference
between
our
position
and
that
position
is
that
if
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time
the
prisoner
cannot
be
restored
to
competence,
the
claim
should
move
forward
without
him
using
the
best
evidence
that's
available.
that's
because
when
we
arrive
at
post-conviction
proceedings,
we
have
a
conviction
and
a
sentence
that
have
been
affirmed
on
direct
appeal
and
are
presumed
to
be
valid,
and
although
it's
a
valid
consideration
for
the
district
court
to
take
into
account
whether
the
prisoner
is
competent
and
could
assist
his
counsel
has
a
role
in
these
proceedings,
there's
no
right
for
the
prisoner
to
be
competent
during
the
post-conviction
proceedings.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yeah.
we
think
the
outer
limit
should
be
presumptively
about
a
year.
it's
not
to
say
that
the
united--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--justice
ginsburg,
we
think
that
it
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
allow
the
defendant
to
try
to
regain
his
competence
and
help
his
lawyer
with
the
proceedings
if
there
is
some
opportunity
for
him
to
present
evidence
or
to
present
new
claims
in
his
proceeding.
that
may
be
the
case.
it
will
often
be
the
case
for
a
section
2255
petitioner.
it
is
his
first
round
of
federal
post-conviction
proceedings.
it
may
be
his
first
opportunity
to
present
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
and
in
those
circumstances,
if
he
has
something
that
--
if
the
lawyer
has
something
that
he
wants
the
prisoner's
assistance
with
or
may
need
testimony
from
--
from
the
prisoner,
we
think
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
allow
a
stay,
a
limited
stay
to
allow
the
prisoner
to
regain
his
competence.
ms.
ann
o'connell
right.
in
those
cases,
we
think
that
no
stay
is
appropriate,
that
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
enter
a
stay.
aedpa
doesn't
tolerate
delay
without
a
justification,
and
if
it's
a
record-based
claim
like
a
state
prisoner
where
he's
barred
by
section
2254(d)
in
pinholster
from
bringing
in
new
evidence
and
that
the
review
is
strictly
limited
to
the
state
court
record,
then
there
is
no
role
for
the
prisoner
to
play
and
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
stay
the
proceedings
in
an
effort
to
bring
him
back.
ms.
ann
o'connell
we
--
we
think
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
grant
a
stay
when
the
prisoner's
participation
could
be
--
he
could
provide
a
useful
source
of
evidence
or
guidance
in
the
proceedings.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yes.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yes.
in
those
circumstances,
we
don't
think
the
district
court
would
abuse
its
discretion
by
allowing
him
an
opportunity
to
regain
his
competence.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yes,
yes.
ms.
ann
o'connell
right.
ms.
ann
o'connell
if
there
is
an
opportunity
for
this
prisoner
to
present
new
claims
or
new
evidence
in
his
section
2255
proceeding,
that
we
don't
think
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
allow
him
that
opportunity.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that's
right.
we
think
it
has
to
be
just
a
limited
stay.
we
--
the
united
states
would
be
opposed
in
any
circumstances
to
a
stay
that's
conditioned
only
on
the
prisoner's
ability
to
regain
his
competence.
at
some
point
if
he
can't,
we
move
forward.
ms.
ann
o'connell
not
just
that
there
was
enough,
but
that
the
federal
court
would
be
prohibited
from
considering
further
information.
ms.
ann
o'connell
no.
ms.
ann
o'connell
no.
because
both
--
all
of
the
claims
involved
in
these
two
cases
are
limited
to
the
state
court
record
and
federal
post-conviction
proceedings
under
section
24
--
2254(d)
and
pinholster.
this
prisoner
could
not
provide
any
new
evidence
to
his
client
that
could
be
introduced
at
court
or
that
could
be
relied
on
by
the
federal
court.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that's
right.
ms.
ann
o'connell
the
court
doesn't
have
to
do
that.
we're
--
we
were
suggesting
a
year
as
the
outer
limit
just
because
that
is
sort
of
what
the
amici
say
is
sort
of
the
outer
limit
for
when
people
will
be
restored
to
competency
if
they
are
going
to
be
able
to
be
restored;
but,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
--
to
set
an
outer
limit.
i
mean,
it
--
it
--
but
it
--
what
we
are
most--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
perhaps
it
isn't.
but
to
--
to
go
along
with
that
analogy,
if
a
different
piece
of
evidence
or
a
different
witness
were
unavailable,
we
wouldn't
allow
the
district
court
to
hold
up
the
proceedings
indefinitely
to
wait
for
that
witness.
and
so
it
should
be
no
different
when
the
petitioner--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
you
know,
if
the
court
wants
to
provide
more
--
more
guidance
to
district
courts,
i
mean,
we
would
say
that
about
a
year
is
how
long
it
would
take
for
a
person--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--to
regain
their
competence.
ms.
ann
o'connell
that
would
be
a
perfectly
appropriate
--
also
a
perfectly
appropriate
way
to
dispose
of
this
case,
to
conclude
that
all
of
these
claims
were
limited
to
the
record,
and
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
grant
a
stay
in
these
cases.
thank
you.
