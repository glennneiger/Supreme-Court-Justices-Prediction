mr.
scott
michelman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ohio
and
the
united
states
have
agreed
today
that
courts
have
the
authority
to
stay
habeas
proceedings
when
the
petitioner
is
mentally
incompetent.
so
then
the
questions
for
this
court
are
when
may
such
stays
issue
and
how
long
may
such
stays
be.
the
court's
answers
should
reflect
the
important
principle
that
no
individual
should
lose
potentially
meritorious
claims
because
of
mental
illness.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing--
mr.
scott
michelman
--i
think
that's
--
that's
a
crucial
question,
justice
sotomayor,
that
justice
kennedy
asked
as
well.
and
it
goes
to
the
limits
on
second
or
successive
petitions.
they
can't
come
back
if
they
are
later
competent
if
they
first
lose
their
claim
because
they
didn't
have
the
evidence
they
needed
and
then
try
again
later.
they
are
subject
to
the
bar
on
second
or
successive
petitions,
which
requires
not
only
that
they
have
new
facts,
but
also
that
they
have
new
law.
so
that's
a
very
restrictive
standard
that
would
not
allow
them
to
simply
pick
up
where
they
left
off.
mr.
scott
michelman
mr.
chief
justice,
section
2244(b),
the
bar
on
second
or
successive
petitions.
imagine
mr.
carter
has
a
potentially
meritorious
claim
now
that
he
can't
speak
to
because
of
his
incompetence,
it's
adjudicated
without
him,
he
loses
it.
mr.
scott
michelman
imagine
it's
adjudicated
without
him,
he
loses
it,
and
then
he
can't
simply
waltz
back
into
court
and
say:
i'm
here,
i'm
competent;
hear
me
out.
mr.
scott
michelman
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
scott
michelman
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
scott
michelman
yes.
and,
in
fact,
the
record
lends
some
support
to
this
suggestion
by
showing
that
counsel
frequently
put
their
own
safety
and
their
own
concerns
ahead
of
my
client's
interests,
for
example
stating
on
the
record
--
and
i'm
quoting
here
from
trial
counsel
--
"i
am
still
worried
about
him
behaving
during
this
phase.
"
"so
the
bottom
line
is,
he
wants
to
stay
where
he
is.
"
so
there
is
a
question
of
whether
trial
counsel
was
really
looking
out
for
mr.
carter's
interests
at
that
time.
there's
also
the
question
of
whether--
mr.
scott
michelman
--yes,
justice
sotomayor.
there
is
strong
support
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
mr.
carter
has
additional
information
to
provide,
both
about
his
desire
to
return
to
the
courtroom
and
about
his
competence
once
he
was
removed
from
the
courtroom.
was
he
hallucinating
during
the
trial?
could
he
see
it?
could
he
communicate
with
counsel?
mr.
scott
michelman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
scott
michelman
no,
you're
right,
justice
kennedy.
i
misspoke.
he
needs
new
law
or
new
facts,
but
the
new
facts
have
to
come
with
a
showing
of
actual
innocence.
i
misstated
that.
i
apologize.
but,
either
way,
new
law
is--
mr.
scott
michelman
--new
facts
are
not
enough.
mr.
scott
michelman
and--
mr.
scott
michelman
--and
(b)(2)--
mr.
scott
michelman
"--
the
facts
underlying
the
claim,
if
proven,
would
show
that
but
for
the
constitutional
error--
"
mr.
scott
michelman
--right.
so
he
needs
not
only
the
new
facts,
but
needs
to
meet
that
higher
standard
showing
that
no
reasonable
factfinder
would
have
found
him
guilty.
but
one
of
his
claims,
his
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
in
mitigation,
goes
to
not
his
guilt,
but
his
punishment.
so
that
claim
would
be
barred
under
2254.
additionally,
his
competence
doesn't
go
to
his
guilt
either.
mr.
scott
michelman
that's
potentially
correct,
justice
alito.
but
i
would
emphasize
the
role
of
the
district
courts
as
gatekeepers
for
only
potentially
meritorious
claims
that
are
truly
suggested
on
the
record
that
someone--
mr.
scott
michelman
--where
it's
truly
suggested
on
the
record
that
the
petitioner
could
help,
if
competent,
so
that
we
wouldn't
be
engaging
in
imaginative
speculation
or
claims
that
were
purely
record
based.
mr.
scott
michelman
well,
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
suggested
by
the
record.
i'm
not
sure
the
adverb
truly
is
necessary.
mr.
scott
michelman
well,
i
would
look
to
this
court's
decision--
mr.
scott
michelman
--i
think
it
would
be
--
well,
i
guess,
not
compared
to
the
iqbal
standard,
your
honor.
probably
the
plausibility
standard
would
actually
be
somewhat
analogous,
although--
mr.
scott
michelman
--well,
but
that's
not
the
only
criterion,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
be
not
only
that
it
was
suggested
by
the
record
that
it
was
a
potentially
meritorious
claim,
as
the
district
court
found,
and
the
standard
this
court
endorsed
in
rhines,
but
also
that
the
petitioner
is
genuinely
incompetent.
this
doesn't
happen
very
often.
in
fact,
in
the
state's
amicus
brief
discussing
how,
in
their
characterization,
this
type
of
litigation
has
exploded
in
the
ninth
circuit,
in
their
characterization,
they
pointed
only
to
nine
cases
in
the
past
nine
years,
so
--
and
not
all
of
those
resulted
in--
mr.
scott
michelman
--justice
alito,
i
think
district
courts
have
a
wide
amount
of
discretion
in
that
matter,
and
they
could
say,
well,
it
looks
like
there
is
a
little
evidence
here,
but,
based
on
what
i
think
you
could
tell
me,
i
don't
think
there
is
enough.
here,
by
contrast,
the
district
court
did
find
that
mr.
carter's
competent
assistance
was
necessary.
so
i
think
we
have
to
trust
the
district
courts
to
be
gatekeepers--
mr.
scott
michelman
--that's
--
that's
correct,
justice
alito.
that
would
be
something--
mr.
scott
michelman
--i
think
it
is
consistent
with
aedpa,
your
honor,
because
of
this
court's
recent
jurisprudence
in
martinez,
in
holland
and
rhines,
which
make
clear
that
aedpa
did
not
pursue
finality
at
all
cost.
it
did
not
eliminate
the
discretion,
the
equitable
discretion
of
the
district
courts
that
they
traditionally
enjoyed,
as
this
court
stated
in
holland.
and
as
this
court
stated
in
martinez,
the
court
is
concerned
that
there
could
be
claims
that
no
court
will
have
heard,
not
the
state
court,
not
the
federal
court.
mr.
scott
michelman
yes,
justice.
mr.
scott
michelman
it's
a
different
standard,
justice
scalia.
mr.
scott
michelman
well,
it
could
be
easier
in
some
cases,
but
harder
in
others.
mental
--
mental
health
science
is
complex,
so
one
might
be
competent
to--
mr.
scott
michelman
--and
he
has
to
understand
why.
mr.
scott
michelman
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
the
test--
mr.
scott
michelman
--i
don't
think
that's
true,
justice
scalia,
because
the
two
standards
are
different
and
for
different
purposes.
so
there
could
be
individuals
who
meet
one
and
not
the
other.
it's
not
--
it's
not
an
either/or
choice.
mr.
scott
michelman
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
even
if
one
is
easier--
mr.
scott
michelman
--that's
right,
justice
ginsburg.
we
--
our
standard
builds
in
the
assumption
that
there
will
be
mental
health
experts
that
will
testify
to
the
condition
of
the
petitioner.
so
the
petitioner
can't
simply
select
a
standard
and
declare
that
he
meets
it.
he
would
have
to
satisfy
mental
health
professionals
that
he
meets
that
standard,
whether
it's
competency
to
be
executed
or
competency
for
these
purposes.
and
so
that
will--
mr.
scott
michelman
--i
understand
sometimes
that's
not
true,
justice
scalia,
but
that's
why
we
rely
on
the
district
courts
to
do
what
they
do
every
day
in
the
trial
competency
context
and
adjudicate
conflicting
claims
about
a
petitioner's
mental
competence--
mr.
scott
michelman
--i
don't
think
you
are,
justice
kennedy,
though
i
won't
speak
for
mr.
gonzales.
mr.
carter
does
not
press
a
constitutional
argument
here,
only
the
argument
that
a
district
court's
discretion,
which
the
state
of
ohio
recognizes,
to
stay
habeas
proceedings
should
cover--
mr.
scott
michelman
--well,
i
don't
think
there
needs
to
be
constitutional
unfairness
for
there
to
be
unfairness.
for
instance,
this
court's
opinion
in
martinez--
mr.
scott
michelman
--well--
mr.
scott
michelman
--i
think
martinez
v.
ryan
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
that
point,
justice
kennedy,
because
there,
the
court
held,
not
that
there
was
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
habeas
stage,
but
that
ineffective
assistance
on
initial
review
collateral
proceedings
could
provide
cause
and
prejudice
to
overcome
a
procedural
default
in
order
that
the
petitioner
would
not
lose
his
claim,
and
that
--
to
prevent
a
situation
where
no
court
would
hear
of
the
claim
before
he
was
executed.
mr.
scott
michelman
that's
--
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
if
the
facts
haven't
been
presented
--
and
here
what
of
the
district
court
found
was
there
were
facts
missing,
facts
that
were
exclusively
within
mr.
carter's
knowledge.
they
weren't
presented
to
the
state
court,
they
haven't
been
available
to
either
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court,
so
it's
possible
this
man
could
be
executed
and
no
one
could
have
fully
heard
these
potentially
meritorious
claims.
mr.
scott
michelman
well,
we
would
leave
it
in
the
first
place
to
the
district
court's
discretion.
we
--
as
far
as
the
question
of
indefinite
stays
go,
we
agree
with
the
state
of
ohio
that
most
competency
issues
are
resolved
within
a
matter
of
months,
so
we
can
expect--
mr.
scott
michelman
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
and
this
--
this
would
be
a
rare
case
in
which
a
stay
might
need
to
be
more
than
6
months,
9
months,
a
year.
but
because
most
--
in
most
situations,
the
competency
issue
will
resolve
in
a
short
period
of
time,
this
court
shouldn't
fear
that
it's
opening
the
floodgates
to
long
stays
in
many,
many
cases.
there
--
this
is
a
rare
case
with
a
very
severely
ill
man
with
potentially
meritorious
claims
that
require
his
assistance.
that's
not
something
that--
mr.
scott
michelman
--well,
because
the
issue--
mr.
scott
michelman
--yes,
justice
alito.
and
that's
because
the
competency
question
at
this
point
is
retrospective.
we're
not
talking
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
simply
examining
mr.
carter
today
and
saying,
"how
do
you
feel?
"
"what
do
you
experience?
"
"are
you
hearing
the
voice
of
the
devil?
"
but
it's
a
question
of
was
he
doing
that
during
his
trial
14
years
ago.
and
that's
why
it's
important
that
he
be
able
to
participate
now.
what
the
sixth
circuit
ordered
in
this
case
was
a
remand
for
a
narrow
stay
with
appropriate
monitoring
by
the
district
court
to
make
sure
that
this
didn't
become
just
sit
around
on
the
docket
for
years
with
nobody
looking
at
it.
mr.
scott
michelman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
scott
michelman
with
respect
to
the
underlying
claim.
that's
the
question.
mr.
scott
michelman
i
understand
that
they
do,
your
honor.
i
understand
it
is
possible
for
a
person
with
a
psychosis
to
recover
and
have
memories
of
experiences
during
that
psychosis.
now,
i
admit
that's
not
a
fact
in
the
record,
but
that's
something
that,
if
we're
dispositive,
could
be
established
on
remand
in
this
case.
so
it's
because
of
the
rarity
of
these
claims,
because
they
are
not
going
to
come
up
every
day,
and
because
district
courts
exist
as
strong
checkpoints
to
prevent
non-genuine
claims
of
competence
or
not
potentially
meritorious
claims
for
which
the
petitioner's
assistance
is
necessary,
a
narrow
stay
authority
should
be
preserved
and
should
be
applied
to
mr.
carter's
case.
mr.
scott
michelman
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
scott
michelman
well,
in
this
case
--
and
i
think
it
really
illustrates
the
narrowness
of
the
sixth
circuit's
order.
in
this
case
he
had,
for
example,
claims
about
the
jury
instructions.
he
had
claims
about
prosecutorial
misconduct.
he
has
a
claim
about
the
method
of
execution
that
the
state
of
ohio
uses.
these
claims
may
go
forward
because
they
don't
require
his
assistance.
and
it's
a
measure
of
the
sixth
circuit's
moderation
and
discretion
that
they
held
that
only
the
claims
that
genuinely
require
his
assistance
should
be
stayed;
the
others
may
go
forward
with
the
help
of
the
next
friend.
mr.
scott
michelman
well,
i
suppose
there
would
be
some
appeal
to
the
notion
that
the
district
court
might
stay
the
rest
of
it,
simply
waiting,
your
honor;
but
we
don't
think
that's
likely
to
happen
frequently.
thank
you.
