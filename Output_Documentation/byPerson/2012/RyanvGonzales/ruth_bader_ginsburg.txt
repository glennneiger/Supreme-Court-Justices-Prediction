in
which
cases
would
you
say
the
defendant's
ability
to
assist
counsel
is
necessary,
on
what
issues?
you
say
that
if
--
the
assistance
has
to
be
necessary
to
a
fair
adjudication--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
what
cases
would
that
be
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
about
a
very
narrow
range
of
cases,
because
i
take
it
your
principal
position
is
it
--
it
would
be
unusual
that
the
defendant
needs
to
be
competent
in
order
for
the
lawyer
effectively
to
represent
him
on
habeas.
so,
under
what
circumstances
do
you
think
competency
matters
so
that
the
lawyer
should
not
be
expected
to
go
on
without
a
competent
client?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
should
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
should
the
court
do
that?
why
should
it
provide
any
guidance
if,
as
you
say,
in
both
of
these
cases
the
review
is
limited
to
the
record,
and
we
would
never
get
to
the
question
of,
if
it
weren't
reviewed,
limited
to
the
record,
then
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
couldn't
you
use
the
transcript?
everything
--
all
--
all
the
exchanges
between
the
defendant
and
the
trial
judge
are
in
the
transcript.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
district
judge
in
this
case
explained
why
he
concluded
that
there
was
no
issue
that
couldn't
be
fairly
adjudicated
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
what
was
wrong
with
his
explanation?
he
looked
at
the
case
carefully
and
he
said:
there's
nothing
that
can't
be
fairly
adjudicated
on
the
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
treatment
stopped
because
he
said
there
were
side
effects?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
opposing
counsel
says
there
is
an
exception
for
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
under
our
decision
in
martinez.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
like
--
like
the
stay
in
rees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
have
to
--
to
maintain
your
position,
the
court
would
have
to
qualify
rees,
or
at
least
the
interpretation
that
says
the
stay
should
be
indefinite
once
the
petitioner
is
found
incompetent,
because
that's
what
happened
there.
the
court
said,
find
out
if
he's
competent.
the
answer
was,
he
is
incompetent.
and
then
the
court
just
let
it
sit
until
the
man
died.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
be
no
stay
at
all
unless
it's
necessary
for
just
adjudication
of
the
claim,
so
that
would
be
a
threshold
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
least
only
--
only
in
cases
where
the
--
the
claim
of
incompetence
is
genuine.
i
mean,
if
anyone
says,
oh,
i
want
to
make
--
take
advantage
of
the
more
defendant-friendly
standard,
all
i
have
to
do
is
allege
i'm
incompetent.
but
that's
not
the
case.
he
has
to
be.
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
that
determines
he
is,
indeed,
incompetent.
and
most
defendants
i
don't
think
would
be
able
to
establish
that
they
are,
indeed,
incompetent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
this
one,
because
the
claim
is
he
was
never
competent;
isn't
that
so?
he
wasn't
competent
to
stand
trial,
and
he
--
his
mental
condition
never
improved.
so
this
person,
if
--
if
the
standard
is
he's
got
to
be
competent,
the
likelihood
is
he
will
never
be
competent
because
he
wasn't
even,
according
to
him,
competent
at
the
time
he
was
tried.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
staying
everything,
according
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
there
are
issues
or
may
be
issues
that
can
go
forward
right
away.
and
as
to
that,
is
there
any
issue
that
could
be
argued
despite
the
incompetence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
those?
