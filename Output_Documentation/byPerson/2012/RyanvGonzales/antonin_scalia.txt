you
don't
think
that
aedpa
would
alter
the
outcome
of
rees?
do
you
think
rees
would
come
out
the
other
way
after
aedpa?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
all
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
really
understand
why
the
american
psychiatric
association
said
six
to
nine
months,
too.
ninety
percent
are
cured
within
nine
months,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
have
to
follow
them
in
that
non
sequitur,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
are
not
lawyers,
right?
they
are
psychiatrists.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's
a
reasonable
extension?
justice
antonin
scalia
another
4
months?
6
months?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
with
you.
it
seemed
to
me
you
had
something
really,
really
clear
and
solid
until,
you
said
“
reasonable
extension
”.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
any
different
from
what
the
defendants
are
arguing
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
saying,
you
know,
give
a
--
give
a
temporary
stay
and
extend
it
as
long
as
--
as
you
need
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
taking
their
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
“
could
provide
”
means
might
provide;
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
just
a
possibility--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
all
it
takes?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
if
the
client
is
incompetent,
you
--
you
bring
both
claims,
right?
you
--
you
both
--
you
both
challenge
the
guilt,
and
you
challenge
the
sentence.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
--
why
--
why
is
it
--
it
is
unfair
to
prevent
--
to
stop
everything
so
that
the
client
can
tell
you
not
to
bring
one
of
those
things?
i
don't
know
why
that's
unfair.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
get
that
in,
right?
i
mean,
aren't
you
limited
to
the
record?
so
what
--
what
use
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
--
to
find
out
these
little
--
little
secret
things
that
your
client
knows
if
they
cannot
be
admitted?
justice
antonin
scalia
alternatively,
we
could
--
we
could
rule
that
indefinite
stays
are
never
appropriate;
in
which
case,
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
decide
whether
any
stay
is
appropriate
where
--
for
a
record-based
claim,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can
do
it
from
either
end.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
we
could
decide
both,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
rees
was
not
an
indefinite
stay
in
--
in
the
absolute
sense,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
trial
proceeded.
there
was
going
to
be
an
end,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
really
not
the
same
question
when
it
comes
back,
is
it?
because
there
are
two
questions:
is
reasonable
competence
useful
for
his
defense;
but,
also,
the
second
question,
is
there
a
reasonable
probability
that
he
can
be
restored
to
competence?
the
first
time,
there
obviously
is
that,
and
you
give
him
a
year.
when
you
come
back
a
second
time,
you
say,
well,
it's
been
a
year.
they
usually
come
back
within
6
to
9
months.
there
is
no
longer
a
reasonable
probability.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
michelman,
we
have
established
a
different
standard
for
the
degree
of
competence
that
has
to
exist
in
order
to
prevent
execution,
right?
the
prisoner
has
to
be
aware
of
what
is
being
done
and
why
it's
being
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
much
lower
standard
than
the
standard
of
competence
required
for
deciding
whether
he
can
assist
counsel,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
--
no,
it's
a
much
--
it's
a
much
easier
standard
for
the
state
to
establish.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
all
he
has
to
know
to
prevent
--
to
prevent
execution
is
he
has
to
know
that
he's
being
executed
for
a
crime,
right?
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
order
to
assist
counsel,
doesn't
he
have
to
know
a
lot
more
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
make
believe
that
i'm
right
about
that,
okay,
that
there
are
two
standards,
and
one
is
really
quite
more
difficult
than
the
other.
why
isn't
the
difference
between
the
standards
utterly
eliminated?
because
whenever
there
is
a
capital
case,
a
habeas
petition
is
filed,
and
counsel
says,
my
--
my
client
cannot
--
cannot
assist
me.
oh,
yes,
he
understands
why
he's
being
executed,
but
he
may
have
a
new
claim,
he
may
be
able
to
tell
me
stuff,
so
we
have
to
stay
the
execution
indefinitely
until
he
can
assist
--
assist
me
in
continuing
his
defense.
you've
just
converted
the
standard
for
proceeding
with
the
execution
from
an
easier
one
to
a
much
more
difficult
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
mental
health
experts
always
agree,
don't
they?
those
provided
by
the
defense
always
agree
with
those
provided
by
the
prosecution.
yes.
