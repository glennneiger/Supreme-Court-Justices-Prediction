mr.
leticia
marquez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
correcting
a
statement
by
the
united
states.
mr.
gonzales
is
not
precluded
by
2254(d)
or
pinholster.
mr.
gonzales
has
identified
several
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
that
would
be
ripe
for
review
under
this
court's
decision
in
martinez
and,
therefore,
would
be
available
in
district
court.
and
we
would
also
be
able
to
present
new
evidence.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
in
our
particular
case,
we
--
we
raise
several
claims
in
habeas
--
in
habeas
proceedings.
we
raise
guilt
claims,
and
we
also
raise
sentencing
claims.
and
it
is
often
the
case
with
our
clients
that,
at
their
direction,
they
choose
not
to
--
not
to
pursue
or
do
not
want
to
pursue
sentencing
claims
and
want
to
only
pursue
guilt
claims.
so
those
are
claims
that
are
strictly
on
the
record,
and
under
the
aba
guidelines
the
client
is
the
ultimate
decisionmaker
as
to
where
the
particular
representation
is
going.
so
that
is
a
huge,
all-encompassing
decision
that
a
client
needs
to
make
as
to
the
ultimate
outcome
of
his
or
her
case.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
your
honor,
where
it
does
--
just
an
example
of
where
if
there
is
a
client
in
--
in
that
particular
situation--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--no,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
in
every
single
case.
mr.
leticia
marquez
the
--
that
situation
goes
with
the
aba
guidelines
and
what
an
attorney's
duties
are
to
maintain
communication
with
the
client.
and
that's
just
but
one
reason
why
we
need
a
--
a
competent
client.
but
to
answer
your
question--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--that
--
that
is
if
a
client
is
incompetent.
i
suppose,
if
that's
--
if
we
were
forced
to
do
so,
we
would.
mr.
leticia
marquez
that's
just
but
one
--
one
reason
why
we
would
need
a
client.
but
to
answer
justice
kagan's
question,
we
--
we
--
there
are
several
claims.
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
are
--
are
necessary
for
--
for
us
to
be
able
to
talk
to
our
client.
and
especially
in
this
case,
where
there
was
an
antagonistic
relationship
between
his
--
the
client
and
the
trial
lawyer,
that
would
put
the
situation
in
context,
and
we
would
able
to
--
be
able
to
identify
those
facts.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
in
--
there
--
there
are
--
transcripts
are
--
are
available
and
--
but
there
are
situations
that
are
not
transcribed.
in
inner
--
in
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims,
the
interactions
between
the
lawyer
and
the
client
at
the
prison,
at
the
jail--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--well--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--well,
as
this
court
held
in
pinholster,
not
all
federal
habeas
claims
fall
within
the
scope
of
2254(d).
and
there
are
situations
where
we
would
be
granted
an
evidentiary
hearing.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
not
yet
been
--
briefed
our
2254(d)
claims.
we
are
at
the
stage
where
we're
going
to
brief
merits
claims,
and,
in
addition
to
that,
we
are
going
to
brief
evidentiary
development
in
this
case,
where
we
would
have
to
assert
what
--
what
facts
need
to
be
developed
and,
also,
the
diligence
standard.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
there
was
--
there
is
information
in
the
record
that
the
trial
judge
and
our
client
had
an
antagonistic
relationship.
and
there
was
comments
--
the
trial
prosecutor
was
interviewed
--
or
said
on
the
--
on
the
record
that
the
judge
and
the
defendant,
mr.
gonzales,
snarled
and
snapped
at
each
other.
mr.
leticia
marquez
right.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
we
would
--
we
would
suggest
that
the
actual
relationship
itself.
we
would
have
to
know
where
--
where
this
relationship
went
awry,
or
why
it
is
that
mr.
gonzales
and
the
trial
judge
were
basically
at
each
other's
throats.
the
intensity--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--we
currently
have
not
been
able
to
get
that
information
from
our
client
as
to
--
to
sit
down
to
--
with
our
client
and
say,
what
happened
in
this
situation?
mr.
leticia
marquez
first,
initially,
the
district
court
judge
agreed
with
--
with
mr.
gonzales
that
there
was
a
need
for
mr.
gonzales
to
be
competent
at
his
habeas
proceeding.
and
we
actually
began
a
course
of
--
of
a
competency
determination.
and
--
and
that
is
a
longer
record.
also,
our
client
went
into
--
was
treated
at
the
state
mental
hospital.
however,
the
--
we
believe
the
trial,
or
the
district
court
judge,
was
in
error
when
he
made
that
finding.
the
trial
judge
did
not
have
--
or
the
district
court
judge
did
not
have
all
the
evidence
before
it
when
the
district
court
looked
at
the
particular
claims.
we
were
just
asked
to
identify.
we
did
not
put
forward
a
--
a
complete
briefing
on
that
issue.
and
the--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--the
judge
decided
it
just
on
a
motion.
mr.
leticia
marquez
excuse
me,
your
honor.
no.
we
--
a
year
or
6
months,
just
by
listening
to
the
questions
from
the
court,
seems
to
be
problematic.
we
suggest
that
this
is
all
within
the
district
court's
discretion.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
your
honor,
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
look
to
this
decision
in
rhines,
where
--
and
my
answer
is,
we
can
look
at
a
year.
and
possibly,
if
the
client
is
not
competent
at
the
end
of
that
year,
then
explore
other
options
such
as
next
friend
or
perhaps
proceeding.
but
what
we
would
do
is
direct
the
court
to
this
court's
decision
in
rhines,
where
stays
were
--
where
district
courts
are
allowed
to
--
to
stay
a
proceeding
so
that
the
petitioner
could
--
could
go
back
to
state
court
and
exhaust.
and
in
--
in
that
decision,
the
court
was
specific
as
to
guidelines
for
the
district
court
to
assert
its
discretion.
30-day
updates,
make
sure
that
clients
are
not
--
are
not
being
dilatory
in
seeking
these
stays,
and
so
forth.
and
the
--
there
has
not
been
a
problem
with
rhines
stays.
the
district
courts
have
been
able
to
handle
those
stays.
mr.
leticia
marquez
we
believe
that
the
district
court
was
--
abused
its
discretion,
but
first
did
not
apply
the
correct
standard,
which
is
essential
communication.
the
district
court
erroneously
decided
that
mr.
gonzales
was
not
essential,
or
his
communication
was
not
essential
to
the
proceedings.
mr.
leticia
marquez
yes.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
we
would
--
we
would
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
district
--
or
the
ninth
circuit's
essential
communication
standard,
where
you
first
have
a
finding
of
competency,
and
then
a
determination
of
whether
that
client's
communication
is
essential
to
the
proceeding.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
that's
how
the
cases
are
--
are
being
raised.
always
there
is
a
question
of
competency,
and
then
the
courts
are
looking
to
whether
or
not
there
is
essentiality.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
argument
that
the
aedpa
somehow
--
or
aedpa
--
somehow
forecloses
any
types
of
stays.
congress
recognized
the
need
for
finality
to
be
balanced
against
a
firm
regard
for
due
process
and
full
constitutional
protections.
so
we
are--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--but
i
was
just
--
i
was
just
letting
the
court
know
that
the
aedpa
does
not
foreclose
stays.
i
thought
i
heard--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--exactly,
your
honor.
also,
i
would
like
to
address
the
court's
--
or
the
government's
concern
as
to
whether
or
not
these
cases,
or
rohan
decisions,
would
open
the
floodgates
to
district
court
stays.
the
--
we've
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
on
page
32,
33,
the
few
stays
that
have
actually
been
granted.
the
district
courts
have
been
handling
these
motions.
and
unless
there's
any
further
questions--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--i
believe
there's
an
obligation
for
counsel
to
continue
to
try
to
effectively
communicate
with
his
client.
and
once
that
attorney
gets
to
a
point
where
that
incapacity
forestalls
that
attorney
from
being
able
to
move
forward
on
his
case,
then
that
attorney
is
at
that
point
under
a
duty
to
raise
this
claim
with
the
district
court.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
that's
--
that's
the
million
dollar
question.
i
would
think
that
the--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--i
--
i
think
the
aba
guidelines
on
ethical
duties
guide
attorneys
to
make
that
decision.
and
yes
--
i'm
sorry
--
if
there
is
dilatory
action
on
the
part
of
the
attorney,
that
is
something
for
the
district
court
to
consider
in
issuing
a
stay.
mr.
leticia
marquez
the
motion
in
this
case
was
made
when
we
--
the
stay
was
lifted
in
district
court,
and
we
were
ordered
to
do
--
to
do
merits
briefing.
mr.
leticia
marquez
that
was
in
2000
--
february
2006.
mr.
leticia
marquez
it
was
filed
in
july
2000.
mr.
leticia
marquez
yes.
mr.
leticia
marquez
the
counsel
was
attempting
to
communicate
with
the
--
with
mr.
gonzales
the
entire
time.
at
that
point,
the
case
was
stayed
in
district
court
for
rhines
and
ring
and
summerlin
determinations.
and--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--no.
we
were
having
difficulty
with
the
client
the
entire
time
since
we
started
--
since
we
first
got
on
the
case.
and
after
--
and
we
just
thought
he
was
a
difficult
client.
and
after
we
--
we
filed
the
amended
petition,
which
was
basically
a
notice
pleading,
the
--
within
a
month
of
that,
we
first
got
in
contact
with
mental
health
experts
saying
there's
something
wrong
with
this
guy,
and
sought
to
put
together
his
mental
health
history.
at
that
point,
mr.
gonzales
was
back
in
state
court
exhausting
issues
and
raising
ring
claims.
in
that
court
--
in
the
state
and
district
court
--
in
that
court,
his
post-conviction
counsel
raised
ineffective
assistance
--
i'm
sorry,
competency
issues
--
and
it
was
--
and
it
was
an
incompetency
to
assist
in
post-conviction
--
post-conviction
--
and
that
claim
was
denied.
mr.
leticia
marquez
no.
it
was
not
until
the
district
court
ordered
--
or,
actually,
the
district
court
ordered
him
transported
back
to
--
or
transported
to
the
state
mental
hospital,
and
there
he
was
to
be
evaluated
to
finally
determine
competency.
and
while
there,
he
was
--
he
was
treated.
and
while
he
was
being
treated,
he
was
starting
to
regain
competency,
at
least
to
some
extent.
then
treatment
stopped.
mr.
leticia
marquez
because
he
had
back
pain.
and
then
we
began
briefing
on
what
the
course
of
treatment
should
be,
if
any.
mr.
leticia
marquez
i
believe
he
was
at
the
state
mental
hospital
for
about
six
months,
and
he
was
being
evaluated.
and
as
--
inadvertently,
then,
the
state
mental
hospital
began
treatment.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
first,
our
client
did
not
say
he
couldn't
be
treated
because
--
that
he
couldn't
be
treated.
it
was
just
these
specific
drugs.
and
we
were
on
a
course
of
trying
to
figure
out
what,
if
any,
other
regimen
was
available.
and
we
believe
that
it
is
within
the
district
court's--
mr.
leticia
marquez
--they
--
they
quickly
transported
him
back
to
doc,
and
he
is
not
being
treated
currently.
mr.
leticia
marquez
no,
your
honor.
and
we
are
--
we
do
not
have
--
he
will
not
see
us,
and
we
do
not
have
access
to
medical
records
because
we
do
not
have
a
current
release.
and
the
district
court
did
not
grant
us
an
order
to
get
those
records
on
a
consistent
basis.
so
we
have
no
access
to
our
client
whatsoever.
mr.
leticia
marquez
well,
we
haven't
moved
forward
in
district
court.
we
have
been
here
appealing
our
decision.
or
the
state
has
appealed
the
decision.
