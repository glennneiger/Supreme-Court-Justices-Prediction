mr.
thomas
c.
horne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
picking
up
on
a
question
asked
by
justice
ginsburg
on
the
rees
case.
the
rees
case
is
pre-aedpa.
if
there
is
one
thing
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
aedpa,
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
it
is
that
the
death
penalty
process
needs
to
be
speeded
up,
and
habeas
should
not
result
in
undue
delays
to
give
effect--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--well,
i
think
that
rees
didn't
really
deal
with
our
issue,
which
is
competence
to
aid
counsel.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
i
agree,
your
honor,
but
i
thought
it
would
be
relevant
to
point
out
that
it
was
pre-aedpa.
and
then,
on
that
point,
this
court
has
said
several
times
that
habeas
should
not
be
used
to
grant
indefinite
stays.
in
fact,
even
pre-aedpa,
in
the
barefoot
case,
this
court
said
that
habeas
is
not
a
time
to
retry
a
case,
and
even
less
is
it
a
time
to
grant
indefinite
stays.
so
the
sentence
with,
“
even
less
”,
followed
the
sentence
with,
“
not
”.
so
it
was
even
less
than
not
that
it
should
grant
permanent
stays.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
the
ohio
position.
in
the
american
psychiatric
brief,
i
think
it's
page
10,
note
20,
they
said
that
up
to
90
percent
of
the
cases
are
solved
in
six
to
nine
months.
and
i
think
that
if
this
court
set
a
standard
of
no
more
than
a
year
for
the
successive
stays,
that
would
give
some
guidance
to
the
courts.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
because
i
think
the
consequence
of
aedpa
is
that
a
balance
has
to
be
drawn
between
the
fact
that
there
has
to
be
finality.
in
fact,
this
court
has
said
the
purposes
of
aedpa
include
finality,
comity,
federalism,
and
reduction
of
delays
in
death
sentence
cases.
there
needs
to
be
a
balance
between
that
and
the
need
to
have
a
competent
defendant,
if
we
can
have
one,
in
a
case
where
the
testimony
is
necessary.
this
court
has
said
several
times
--
i
was
going
to
mention
also
the
heinze
case,
where
this
court
thinks
that
--
very
clearly
that
stays
cannot
be
indefinite.
so
i
think
it
would
be
very
helpful
for
this
court
to
give
a
guideline
to
the
courts
and
say,
the
way
to
balance
this
is
that
if
they
get
the
time
in
which
90
percent
of
the
cases
are--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
we
think
it
would
be
helpful
--
and
we
agree
with
ohio
on
this
--
we
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
the
court
gave
some
kind
of
a
standard
so
that
there
would
be
some
guidance
and
uniformity,
and
so
that
--
so
that
courts
did
not
get
around
this
court's--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--the
standard
we
would
suggest
would
be
that
six
to
--
six
to
nine
months
would
be
the
standard,
and
certainly
no
more
than
a
year;
that
it
would
be
in
months
and
not
years,
including
not
just
the
first
stay,
but
any
successive
stays.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
in
all
cases.
in
all
cases
where
a
stay
was
appropriate.
now,
in
the
record-based
case,
no
stay
is
appropriate.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
your
honor,
because
the
assumption
--
once
the
conviction
has
occurred,
the
presumptions
shift.
in
the
criminal
trial,
all
the
presumptions
are
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
the
case
has
to
prove
--
the
state
has
to
prove
its
case--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--well,
this
court
said
in
daniels
that
the
presumption
is
that
the
conviction
was
valid,
and
it
becomes
the
burden
of
the
petitioner
to
overturn
that,
or
the
burden
of
the
prisoner
to
overturn
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--sorry?
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
i
would
believe
the
time
would
begin
to
run
with
the
treatment,
because
the
basis
for
the
six
to
nine
months
was
what
was
in
the
amicus
brief
against
us
by
the
american
psychiatric
association
indicating
that
in
six
to
nine
months
almost
90
percent
of
the
cases
are
cured.
so
we
needed
to
have
some
basis
to
suggest
a
standard
to
the
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
i
would
think,
if
the
motion
is
made
and
the
other
requirements
are
shown,
that
it
--
that
the
prisoner's
testimony
is
essential,
then
--
and
that
it's
not
a
record-based
case,
then
i
would
think
the
six
to
nine
months
would
begin
to
run
when
treatment
begins,
because
that
is
our
basis
for
the
standard
we
are
suggesting.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
that's
correct,
your
honor.
when
the
court
--
if
the
court
grants
the
motion
for
the
temporary
stay,
and
presumably
treatment
would
begin
right
away,
or
perhaps
treatment
has
been
ongoing,
but
from
that
point
on
we
suggest
a
six
to
nine
months
standard.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
we
have
difficulty
coming
up
with
cases
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding,
your
honor,
because
presumably
the
information
the
prisoner
would
have
would
be
known
to
others.
especially
if
it's
newly
discovered
evidence,
that
would
typically
be
from
outside,
such
as
a
--
somebody
admitting
--
somebody
else
admitting
to
the
crime,
dna
evidence,
something
of
that
sort.
it
appears
to
us
highly
unlikely
that
the
prisoner
has
information
that
he
didn't
disclose
earlier
when
he
was
competent
in
the
state
proceedings
and
in
the
post-conviction
proceedings
at
the
state
level,
so
we
think
it
would
be
a
very
rare
case,
your
honor.
but
we
are
prepared
to
admit
that
if
a
showing
were
made
that
his
testimony
is
necessary,
that
a
six
to
nine
month
temporary
stay
be
granted,
as
long
as--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--we
had
to
find
something
to
suggest
to
the
court,
and
so
we
took
it
out
of
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--oh,
i
agree,
your
honor.
then
it
should
be
nine
months,
because
that's
the
point
at
which
the
american
psychiatric
association
says
almost
90
percent
of
the
cases
are
solved.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
then
the
case
proceeds--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--correct,
your
honor,
then
the
case
proceeds,
which
was
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--based
on
the
record
--
well,
if
it's
record
based,
there
should
be
no
continuance
at
all.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
we're
just
suggesting
there
should
be
a
guideline,
and
we
had
to
find
some
basis
for
the
guideline.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
we're
suggesting
that
the
court
should
draw
a
line
to
guide
the
other
courts,
so
that
--
so
that
--
because
once
you
allow
one
additional
period,
there
can
be
successive
additional
periods
and
then
it
becomes
an
indefinite
stay.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
well,
this
court
in
heinz
said
that
pre-aedpa,
the
courts
had
discretion
to
grant
stays,
but
aedpa
circumscribe
--
circumscribes
that
discretion,
and
so
i
think
this
court
needs
to
give
guidance
to
the
courts
as
to
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--i
understand,
your
honor.
our
suggestion
is
--
is
that
the
court
give
a
guideline.
i
understand
your
honor's
position.
i
do
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
i
just
wanted
to
make
one
quick
point
about
that
the
--
that
the
witness
has
to
be
essential
to
the
case
being
made.
it
was
suggested
in
the
ohio
case
that
--
that
if
there
were
a
possibility
that
he
could
be
helpful,
that
that
would
be
sufficient.
but
the
american
psychiatric
association
and
the
aba
both
agree
that
there
has
to
be
a
particularized
and
substantial
case
made
that
the
witness
is
necessary
or
--
or
they
also
use
the
word
“
essential
or
necessary
”,
and
we
think
that
that
--
that
standard
should
prevail.
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
need
to
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
on
one
point
about
the
standard.
the
standard
has
to
be
essentiality.
the
witness
has
to
be
essential.
in
fact,
you
heard
my
friend
representing
gonzales
emphasize
essentiality,
and
it
was
emphasized
in
their
--
in
their
responsive
brief
at
pages
1,
2,
9,
10,
11,
12,
21,
30,
and
39.
on
all
of
those
pages,
they
said
the
witness's
testimony
must
be
essential.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
well,
i
think
the
first
--
the
first
priority
is
that
there
should
be
no
indefinite
stay,
and
the
second
priority
is
that
there
should
be
no
stay
in
a
records-based
case.
those
are
the
two
prongs
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
which
we
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--the
time
limit
is
crucial,
but
i
have
to
say
no
stay
on
a
records-based
case
is
a
matter
of
pretty
clear
law
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--i
would
say
it
can't
be
indefinite.
that
would
be
the
first
priority.
but
i
think
it's
also
clear
from
this
court's
very
definite
statements
in
a
number
of
cases
that
--
that
there
cannot
be
a
stay
in
a
records-based
case.
now--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--your
honor,
in
this
case,
the
district
judge
specifically
found
that
there
is
no
possibility
for
a
case
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
those
were
waived
by
the
--
by
--
when
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
state
for
additional
post-conviction
relief
proceedings,
that
claim
was
waived.
it's
in
the
district
court's
order,
appendices
b
and
c
to
our
--
to
our
petition.
and
even
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
argue
that.
the
ninth
circuit
argued
that
there
was
an
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
prejudice
by
the
judge.
but
there
is
a
very
detailed
analysis,
again,
in
the
district
court's
order,
showing
that
every
time
that
claim
was
made,
and
was
claim
--
made
a
number
of
times
in
the
state
proceedings,
it
was
clear
that
those
were
on-the-record
comments.
there
was
nothing
secret.
there
was
nothing
ex
parte.
those
were
on-the-record
discussions
that
were
being
complained
about.
and
the
district
court
judge
found
that
if
there
was
something
secret,
then
those
have
been
waived
by
the
petitioner
because
he
didn't
bring
it
up
in
the
numerous
case
--
times
that
it
came
up
at
the
state
level,
and
he
was
talking
only
about
on-the-record
comments
by
the
trial
judge.
