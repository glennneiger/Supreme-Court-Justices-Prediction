but,
ms.
o'connell,
where
does
that
outer
limit
come
from?
you
suggested
looking
to
that
statute
as
an
analogy,
but
there
would
be
no
outer
limit
in
application
of
that
statute,
would
there?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
marquez,
could
you
tell
me,
if
it
were
the
case
that
somebody
was
limited
to
the
state
court
record,
what's
your
best
example
of
a
case
in
which,
nonetheless,
a
stay
would
be
appropriate;
in
which,
nonetheless,
consultation
with
the
client
was
necessary
for
a
full
and
fair
adjudication?
because
i
have
been
trying
to
think
of
examples,
and,
you
know,
i'm
not
doing
very
well,
quite
honestly.
so
what's
your
best
one?
justice
elena
kagan
general,
could
i
ask
you,
you
have
been
arguing
on
two
different
axes.
one
is
how
tight
the
standard
should
be
to
grant
any
stay
at
all,
and
the
other
is
what
limits
there
should
be
on
how
long
a
stay
can
be
if
a
stay
is
warranted.
and
i'm
just
curious,
if
i
forced
you
to
prioritize
in
terms
of
the
state's
interests
in
effective
habeas
adjudication,
which
is
more
important,
you
know,
cranking
up
the
standard,
or
making
sure
that
there
is
a
time
limit
in
place?
justice
elena
kagan
but
ordered
in
that
way,
that,
for
you,
the
time
limit
is
the
more
important?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
i
know.
but,
really,
i
said,
if
i
forced
you
to
prioritize
between
the
two.
justice
elena
kagan
what
situations
would
they
be
appropriate
in?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
schimmer,
if
you
are
right
that
no
stay
was
appropriate
in
these
circumstances,
we
would
never
reach
the
question
of
how
much
of
a
stay
is
appropriate
in
other
circumstances.
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
saying
the
exact
opposite.
justice
elena
kagan
in
other
words,
if
there
was
one
bright
line
which
says
that
stays
are
not
appropriate
in
a
record-based
claim
because
there's
really
nothing
that
the
client
can
contribute,
then
we'd
have
no
need
or
cause
to
reach
the
second
question
of
what
happens,
in
a
case
where
a
stay
might
be
appropriate,
how
long
that
stay
should
be.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
schimmer,
why
would
that
be?
i
mean,
assume
a
case
where
you
say
a
stay
would
be
appropriate.
so
it's
not
a
closed
record
case;
it's
a
case
where
the
client
might
be
expected
to
provide
information
that's
--
let's
assume
it's
necessary
to
a
full
and
fair
adjudication
of
the
habeas
claim.
why
would
you
cut
it
off
at
a
year?
why
wouldn't
it
be
still
true
in
2
years,
that
a
full
and
fair
adjudication
couldn't
take
place
in
those
circumstances?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
not
an
indefinite
stay.
i
think
the
judge
would
do
what
the
chief
justice
suggested,
that,
you
know,
it's
not
for
ever
and
ever.
we're
just
going
to
come
back
to
it
periodically.
but
if
the
answer
is
the
same,
which
is
that
the
client's
participation
is
necessary
for
a
full
and
fair
adjudication,
then
the
court's
answer
should
be
the
same,
too.
why
isn't
that
right?
