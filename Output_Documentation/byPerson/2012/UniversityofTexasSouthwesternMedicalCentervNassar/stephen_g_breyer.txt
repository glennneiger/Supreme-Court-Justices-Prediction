justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
--
is
this
a
violation
of
title
vii?
i
don't
know
the
answer.
smith
works
for
jones.
jones'
whole
job
is
to
supervise
smith
and
be
certain
that
smith,
a
well-known
racist,
has
kept
his
racism
under
control.
he
didn't.
smith
--
they
fired
someone
--
smith
did
--
did
some
terrible
thing
and
got
rid
of
somebody
for
racist
reasons.
he
tells
his
boss.
his
boss
knows
it.
his
boss
does
nothing
about
it.
all
right?
is
the
boss
violating
section
vii?
he
--
he
had
no
reason
for
doing
nothing
about
it.
he
himself
wasn't
a
racist.
it
was
just
his
job.
but
he
didn't.
is
he
--
is
he
violated
section
vii?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
immediate
supervisor
does.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
yes,
yes.
okay.
so
there
what
we
have
is
somebody
is
guilty
under
section
vii.
even
though
that
individual
did
not
himself
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
it
was
circumstances
where
the
subordinate
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race.
all
right?
and
yet
the
--
there's
no
doubt
that
m
applies
to
that.
m
applies
to
that,
i
imagine,
unless
you're
going
to
start
distinguishing
within
title
vii,
are
you
going
to
say
m
doesn't
apply
to
that.
my
question's
going
to
be,
if
m
applies
to
that,
then
why
doesn't
it
also
apply
here?
because
you
see
here,
what
you
have
is
--
it's
at
one
removed.
it
is
the
individual
who
is
retaliating
been
retaliated
against.
that
individual
did
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
nor
did
the
individual
in
farr
read
into
it,
but
the
whole
thing
is
based
on
race.
and
if
sometimes
under
section
vii
simpliciter,
people
are
guilty
although
the
race
motive
--
the
race
involvement
is
one
level
down.
why
wouldn't
you
--
that
perhaps
is
too
complicated
a
question,
and
if
you
only
have
five
minutes
left,
so
i
will
take
your
answer
as
being,
"judge,
you
better
think
this
out
on
your
own.
"
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
say
you
are
better
off
keeping
your
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
just
like
to
get
to
what
i
think
is
one
of
their
arguments
and
i'm
having
some
--
the
argument
is
purely
linguistic,
all
right?
and
they
say,
read
m.
m
says
race
is
a
motivating
factor
in
an
unfair
employment
situation.
now,
we
look
to
what
the
unfair
employment
situation
is
at
the
beginning
unfair
employment
practice.
it
is
to
dismiss
a
person
because
of
race,
all
right?
so
obviously,
it
applies.
now
we
look
to
the
definition
that
we're
at
issue
in
here.
it
says
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
dismiss
a
person
because
of
retaliation.
now,
retaliation
for
what?
for
race,
that's
true.
but
we're
--
we
couldn't
care
less
about
whether
that
race
is
part
or
a
little
bit
or
it's
all
--
it
could
even
be
totally
unjustified.
what
we're
interested
in
is
the
retaliation.
so
they
say,
you
see,
the
words
of
(m)
do
not
speak
about
race.
they
speak
about
retaliation.
they
speak
about
race.
so,
whatever
the
policy
reasons
are,
you
can't
do
it
any
more
than
if
you
have
a
statute
that
refers
to
carrots
and
you
try
to
put
in
a
beet.
you
just
can't
do
it.
now,
that's
the
answer
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
hear
an
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
have
to
say
retribution
for
race
is
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
--
now,
what
i
was
looking
for,
perhaps
without
success,
is
some
other
example
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
retribution,
but
where
that's
clearly
so.
that's
why
the
example
came
into
my
mind
that
it
is
possible
that
you
could,
under
the
basic
unfair
employment
section,
find
a
person
liable
of
race
discrimination
even
though
that
person
himself
was
not
motivated
by
race,
but
perhaps
had
an
obligation
to
report
a
race
discrimination,
which
he
failed
to
do
because
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
racetrack.
you
see?
i'm
looking
for
some
other
--
is
there
any
other
example
in
the
history
of
these
statutes
where
we've
said,
you,
mr.
jones
or
ms.
smith,
you
are
guilty
of
race
discrimination,
even
though
that's
because
of
your
responsibilities,
because
of
what
you
did
or
didn't
do,
it's
not
because
you
yourself
held
the
motive,
but
you
--
you'd
attribute
the
motive
to
them
for
reasons
to
do
with
the
statute.
is
there
--
does
that
ring
any
bell
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
i
have
looked--
