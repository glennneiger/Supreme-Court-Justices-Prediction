mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
good
morning,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decision
in
gross
does
most
of
the
work
in
this
case
and
the
plain
language
of
the
1991
amendments
to
title
vii
do
the
rest.
under
gross,
nassar
must
prove
that
retaliation
was
the
but-for
cause
of
the
challenged
employment
action
unless
congress
has
specifically
relieved
him
of
that
burden
by
authorizing
a
mixed
motive
claim.
in
--
in
the
1991
amendments,
however,
congress
authorized
mixed
motive
treatment
only
for
title
vii
claims
that
challenge
--
that
challenge
discrimination
based
on
membership
in
a
protected
class,
not
for
retaliation
claims.
and
for
that
reason,
a
title
vii
retaliation
claim
must
prove
but-for
causation.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
yeah.
well,
the
age
act
does
not
permit
any
mixed
motive
claims.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
so
for
this
purpose
in
the
age
act,
everything
is
but-for,
that's
correct.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
well,
that
--
i
mean,
to
some
extent
within
title
vii,
that
is
the
question
in
the
case,
but
what
we
have
here
is
an
amendment
within
title
vii,
it
is
first
in
title
vii
where
it's
set
forth
discrimination
based
on
class
and
discrimination
based
on
retaliation
as
separate
types
of
discrimination,
and
this
provision
treats
them
differently.
it
specifically
limits--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--well,
i
mean
--
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
--
i
would
agree
in
the
sense
that
if
what
we're
talking
about
is
but-for
versus
mixed
motive,
right?
it's
--
it's
but-for
everywhere
except
for
within
the
meaning
of
this
one
amendment.
congress
clearly
intended
to
make
an
exception
here
to
the
normal
but-for,
so
the
question
is
to
the
scope
of
it.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
no,
because
it's
but-for
everywhere
except
for
this
one
amendment.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
not
--
i
can't
point
to
anything
specific
because
what
we
had,
right,
was
--
there
was
--
i
can't
point
to
anything
specific
on
that.
up
until
the
statute,
the
whole
point
of
gross,
right,
is
that
the
statute
carves
out
a
narrow
exception
from
but-for
and--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--well,
i
mean,
yes
and
no,
in
the
sense
that
if
we're
talking
about
but-for
versus
mixed,
right,
yes,
that's
a
creature
of
this
specific
statute
we're
talking
about.
if
we're
talking
about
other
aspects
of
retaliation
and
other
types
of
discrimination,
there
are
differences
in
the
statutes.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
no.
and
the
--
i
mean,
the
backdrop
here,
which
is
the
whole
point
of
gross,
right,
is
that
as
of
price
waterhouse,
we
had,
you
know,
a
somewhat
confusing
and
murky
alignment
of
opinions,
that
--
and
i
think
everyone
agrees
with
this
--
interpreted
only
at
section
2a,
the
discrimination
based
on
class
provision.
then,
two
years
later,
congress
came
in
with
this
amendment
to
specifically
identify
what
it
wanted
to
do
about
mixed
motive.
and
gross
says
that
except
for
when
congress
has
specifically
called
for
this
mixed
motive
treatment,
it's
but-for
is
the
holding
of
gross.
and
when
we
look
to
this
provision
--
i
mean,
there
are
different
ways
of
looking
at
it,
but
one
would
be
to
say
that
i'm
not
aware
of
any
statute
that
has
a
specific
retaliation
provision
where
this
court
has
construed
discrimination
based
on
class
generally
to
encompass
retaliation,
because
that
would
make
the
retaliation
provision
here
in
3a
absolutely
surplusage.
it
would
make
the
other
statutory
cross-references
to
3a
surplusage,
because
you'd
be
taking
the
specific
retaliation
provision
within
title
vii
and
subsuming
it
within
a
general
treatment
of
discrimination
based
on
--
on
class,
race,
and
so
forth.
and
this
basic
structure
of
these
provisions
of
title
vii
is
that
when
congress
wants
to
refer
to
all
title
vii
discrimination
claims,
it
will
refer
as
it
did
in
subsection
2n
to
a
claim
of
employment
discrimination,
generally;
it
will
refer
as
it
did
also
in
section
2
to
an
unlawful
employment
practice,
which
would
cover
the
waterfront,
but
when
it
wants
to
cover
a
specific
subset,
it
refers
to
retaliation
as
spelled
out
in
3(a),
or
to
discrimination
based
on
membership
in
one
of
the
five
protected
classes.
and
here--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--well,
the
reason
--
well,
what
jackson
says
of
course
and
title
vii
is
vastly
different.
and
the--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--well,
the
distinction
that
jackson
draws
and
also
that
gomez-perez
draws
expressly
in
distinguishing
this
type
of
situation
is
if
--
if
you
have
a
broad
general
prohibition
on
discrimination
or
discrimination
based
on
race,
without
more
--
without
more
specificity,
the
court
will
presume
that
that
would
include
retaliation.
but
when
you
have
a
statute,
like
this
one,
that
specifically
singles
that
--
specifically
describes
in
detail
the
different
types
of
prohibited
discrimination,
including
specifically
retaliation,
this
court
has
never
overridden
that
specific
statutory
text
to
put
one
of
those
specifically
broken-out
types
of
discrimination
into
another
more
general
one,
such
as
discrimination
based
on
race,
which
is
why--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--well,
because
otherwise,
you
are
taking
the--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--as
a
matter
--
well,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
right,
which
then
drives
the
outcome,
the
difference
is
that
if
--
if
you
treat
a
specific
retaliation
reference
or
provision
as
being
subsumed
within
a
more
general
one,
a
discrimination
based
on
race,
for
example,
you
are
treating
the
specific
retaliation
reference
to
be
surplusage,
to
have
no
effect
and
to
not
need
to
be
there,
and
you're
treating
the
other
statutory
cross-references
to
it
as
also
being
surplusages,
which
is
why,
when
congress
does
speaks
more
directly
this
court's
never
overridden,
never
said
that
it
will
take
a
specific
retaliation
provision
and
treat
it
like
it's
not
there
and
toss
it
and
--
based
on
race,
for
example.
and
that's
why
--
i
mean,
that's
why
those
general
cases
they
cite,
those
are
our
cases,
because
jackson
specifically
says
that
title
vii
is
vastly
different
for
this
very
reason.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
there
are
a
couple
--
if
you
just
look
at
1991,
there
are
a
few
reasons
that
we
know
from
the
'91
that
doesn't
work.
one
is
at
almost
at
the
same
time
in
1991
congress
enacted
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
where
it
again
separately
broke
out
discrimination
based
on
disability
and
retaliation,
treated
them
separately.
so
congress
hadn't
forgotten
that
it
was
treating
them
differently.
also,
in
this
very
provision,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991,
congress
specifically
cross-referenced
both
the
part
of
title
vii
that
contains
the
general
provision
and
the
part
of
vii,
section
3,
that
contains
retaliation.
so
it's
specifically
dealing
with
these
separate
provisions,
acknowledging
that
it
has
in
fact
presumptively
at
least
has
read
them
and
understands
the
distinction.
i
mean,
i
think
we
presume
it
anyhow,
but
we
know
it
from
the
actual
statutory
text
of
the
'91
--
1991
act.
and
then--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--for
--
for
those
cases
that
--
that
the
motivating
factor
provision
governs,
it's
more
plaintiff-friendly,
yes.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
that
was
basically
the
same
argument
that
this
court
rejected
in
gross,
in
--
in
that
gross
involved
an
absolutely
identical
statutory
provision,
that
was
lifted
in
fact,
deliberately
lifted
verbatim,
from
title
vii
to
be
put
into
the
age
act.
and
what
this
court
held,
basically,
it
was
that,
look:
whatever
congress's
overall
purpose
or
general
purpose
behind
the
1991
act
as
a
whole,
right,
what
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
what
it
actually
did,
what
lines
it
actually
drew
in
any
given
situation.
and
here--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--yes.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
well,
the
--
under
title
vii,
there
are
basically
three
different
ways
to
establish
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
one
is
the
general
provision
for
discrimination
because
of
membership
in
a
class.
one
is
because
of
retaliation.
and
this
is
another
one.
so
this
defines
basically
a
third
way
of
establishing
whether
an
employment
practice
is
unlawful.
and
what
it
says
is
that
any
employment
practice
that
is
motivated
by
one
of
the
five
listed
factors
is
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
so
this
is
why
it
all
keeps
coming
back
to
do
those
five
factors,
those
five
motivations,
do
they
or
do
they
not
include
retaliation?
we
agree
with
the
government
that
that's
what
it
all
comes
down
to.
and
as
to
that
question,
i
mean,
there
was
discussion
earlier
today
about
the
weight
of
authority.
i
mean,
nine
courts
of
appeals
have
squarely
addressed
this.
they've
all
agreed
with
us
because
title
vii's
text
and
structure
are
so
clear,
that
title
vii
--
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
distinction
of
title
vii
in
gomez-perez.
excuse
me.
gomez-perez
distinguished
the
identical
provisions
of
the
age
act,
made
the
same
point.
jackson
again
was
vastly
different
for
this
reason--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--i
apologize,
your
honor.
i
was
just
saying
the
basic
point
is
that,
as
jackson
and
gomez-perez
indicated,
the
specific
controls
the
general.
and
when
congress
breaks
out
retaliation,
that's
a
different
subset
of
discrimination
that's
not
been
subsumed
within
discrimination
based
on
class.
otherwise,
you
are
reading
out
the
retaliation
provisions
and
making
them
surplusage,
which
is
why
all
of
the
many
courts
of
appeals
that
looked
at
this
unanimously
agreed
with
us.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
right.
well,
this
court
has
already
disagreed
with
the
eeoc.
the
eeoc
has
two
footnotes
and
informal
guidance
that
say
that
under
the
1991
amendments
retaliation
claims
can
be
proven
under
a
mixed
motive
theory
for
any
of
the
statutes
that
the
eeoc
administers,
which
is
clearly
contrary
to
gross.
and
that
informal
guidance
does
not
contain
--
what
it
contains
basically
is,
you
know,
policy
analysis
of
why
they
would
like
that
to
be
the
result,
but
no
textual
analysis
whatsoever.
there's
--
so
the
guidance
in
one
doesn't
get
deference
because
it's
contrary
to
the
plain
text
of
the
statute,
as
numerous
courts
of
appeals
have
recognized.
and
two,
in
terms
of
its
power
to
persuade,
i
mean,
this
court
has
already
rejected
it
and
even
as
applied
to
title
vii
retaliation,
you
know,
courts
of
appeals
have
unanimously
rejected
it
as
well
because
there
is
just
policy
there,
there's
no
textual
analysis.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
yes,
the
other's
before.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
i
think
you
are
right
about
the
timing.
and
sullivan
was
so
general
that
--
i
don't
know
that
the
law
was
a
whole
lot
different
in
1991
than
it
had
been
in
'64
on
this.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
right.
but
the
--
and
the
main
point
is
the
one
i
was
making
earlier,
that
in
1991
itself,
congress
was
continuing
to
distinguish
between
retaliation
and
discrimination
based
on
class,
and
in
provisions
of
this
act
and
also
in
the
almost
simultaneously
enacted
americans
with
disabilities
act.
but
there
has
been
another
provision
in
the
disabilities
act
that
treats
retaliation
and
discrimination
based
on
--
on
disability
is
significantly
different
in
terms
of
the
remedies
that
are
available
for
the
two.
so
even
at
the
same
time,
congress
has
elsewhere
also
been
distinguishing
between
the
two.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
well,
what
--
gross
rejected
a
fair
amount
of
that
reasoning,
right?
i
mean,
the
point
is
that
price
waterhouse
--
you
could
say
that
in
price
waterhouse,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
there
should
be
mixed-motive
claims,
right?
now,
congress
shortly
thereafter
came
in
with
the
'91
amendments
to
say,
okay.
we'll
have
mixed
motive
claims
in
this
one
category.
gross
says
that's
a
relatively
narrow
category.
we're
going
to
assume
congress
does
not
want
them
anywhere
else,
even
though,
you
know,
discrimination
under
the
age
act
or
under
title
vii,
you
could
ask
why
should
it
be
different.
well,
because
congress
decided
it
would
be.
here--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--well,
first
off,
it
did.
because
in
this
statute,
as
in
others,
it
distinguishes
between
discrimination
based
on
membership
in
a
class
and
retaliation,
but
it
wants
to
cover
all
of
it,
it
uses
a
more
general
phrase.
when
it
wants
to
cover
one
of
them,
it
says
one.
here
it
said
one.
but
beyond
that,
again,
in
terms
of
the
backdrop
though
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
whole
point
of
gross
is
that
you
--
you
stick
to
the
plain
language
of
'91,
and
that's
--
that's
where
mixed
motive
treatment
is
permitted,
and
also
where
there's
a
--
there's
a
negative
inference
elsewhere
that
is
so
strong
that
as
you
said,
it
applies
even
in
other
statutes.
well,
if
that
negative
inference
applies
in
other
statutes,
it
would
sure
apply
within
the
same
statute
that
--
that
this
provision
exists
in
and
is
amending.
also,
there
are
significant
differences
between
discrimination
based
on
class
and
retaliation
that
congress
could
--
didn't
have
to
--
but
could
certainly
reasonably
choose
to
follow.
one
is
that
retaliation
is
--
well,
excuse
me.
the
primary
evil
congress
was
after
here,
right,
was
discrimination
based
on
race,
sex,
religion,
and
so
forth.
retaliation
is
an
important
derivative
prophylactic
provision
to
help
enforce
the
primary
right,
but
congress
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
significant
cons
with
mixed
motive
treatment
did
not
justify
extending
it
to
the
secondary
right.
also--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--the
only
thing
you'll
find
in
the
legislative
history,
the
only
thing
you'll
find
that's
specific
to
this,
is
that
congress
was
aware
of
retaliation,
including
aware
of
title
vii's
retaliation
provision,
and
it
amended
legislation
to
incorporate
that
provision
when
it
wanted
to.
you're
not
going
to
find
anything
else
in
there.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
well,
the--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--no,
my
--
my
point
is
this.
this
court
explained,
for
example,
in
burlington
northern,
the
two
--
the
two
are
both
prohibited
types
of
discrimination,
generally,
under
but-for
standard,
but
they
are
different,
which
is
why
we
have
different
labels
and
different
names
for
the
two
categories.
and
--
and
congress
could
reasonably
choose
to
give
greater
protection
to
the
primary
right
and
not
the
secondary
one
considering
the
negative.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
yes.
and
textually,
but
it
then
describes
seven
different
unlawful
employment
practices.
discrimination
based
on
the
five
classes
and
discrimination
based
on
the
two
types
of
protected
conduct.
this
provision
then
applies
to
the
five
practices
and
leaves
out
the
two
types
of
protected
conduct,
which
is
why,
textually
speaking,
and
there's
no
contrary
legislative
history,
congress
meant
to
apply
this
to
some,
but
not
all
types
of
unlawful
conduct
--
of
unlawful
--
of
employment
practices.
and
the
reason
that
that's
perfectly
rational
is
three
things.
first,
as
i
mentioned,
this
is
the
secondary
of
them.
second,
it
sweeps
--
by
its
nature,
retaliation
sweeps
so
much
broader,
well
outside
of
the
traditional
workplace.
while
congress
was
thinking
about
jettisoning
traditional
burdens
of
proof
and
relieving
a
plaintiff
of
the
--
of
the
traditional
burden
of
proving
its
own
case,
they
could
certainly
balk
at
doing
that
in
a
much
broader
setting.
and
third,
the
potential
for
meritless
and
abusive
suits
is
particularly
pronounced
in
a
retaliation
context,
because
any
employee
at
all
can
opt
into
a
retaliation
claim
by
making
a
--
a
charge
of
--
a
relevant
charge,
knowing
that
--
you
know,
potentially
knowing
that,
yeah,
the
writing's
on
the
wall,
probably
i'm
going
to
get
fired.
and
if
you
then
flip
the
burden
so
the
plaintiff
doesn't
have
prove
its
own
claim,
the
plaintiff
can
point
to
the
timing
of
his
own
complaint,
the
inevitable
employment
action
would
have
happened
anyway,
and
the
proximity,
then,
is
probably
going
to
get
the
plaintiff
past
summary
judgment.
now,
what
you're
then
looking
at
is
an
expensive
and
unpredictable
trial,
most
defendants
will
be
forced
to
settle
even
meritless
claims.
and
the
eeoc's
own
statistics
show
that,
one,
retaliation
claims
have
become
all
the
rage.
they
are
the
--
the
leading
type
of
claims
being
raised
these
days.
and,
two,
the
eeoc's
reasonable
cause
determination
show
that
only
5
percent
of
them
have
even
reasonable
cause
to
support
them,
which
is
not
an
especially
high
standard.
so
when
we're
talking
about
a
potential
massive
amount
and
growing
amount
of
mostly
meritless
but
expensive
litigation
to
defend,
it's
perfectly
reasonable
for
congress
to
decide,
well,
within
the
scope
of
what
price
waterhouse
was
exactly
dealing
with
--
to
get
back
--
to
get
back
to
justice
kagan's
point
--
we'll
have
--
we'll
allow
some
mixed
motive
treatment
there,
but
that'll
be
it
now,
because
--
because
there
are
other
issues
with
retaliation
that
caused
--
caused
congress
to
reasonably
do
exactly
what
it
so
clearly
did
in
statutory
text.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
it
--
it
was
--
the
same
argument
was
rejected
in
gross,
right?
because
in
gross,
you
had
another
absolutely
identical
provision
to
--
to
the
--
to
the
two
title
vii
provisions
at
issue
here.
and
this
court
held
that,
no,
what
congress
was
doing
in
1991
was
specifically
authorizing
mixed
motive
treatment
when
it
wanted
and
otherwise
casting
what
this
court
called
the
strongest
possible
inference
that
there
would
be
no
other
mixed
motive
treatment.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
if
i
understand
the
hypo
right,
there's
no
question
that
the
immediate
supervisor
and
the
employer--
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
--but-for,
but-for
causation.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
so
it's
just
a
supervisory
hypo
question?
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
no,
no,
no.
no,
no.
hopefully,
i'm
keeping
up
with
you.
if
not,
just
tell
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
were
basically
two
different
parts
to
that.
one
is,
in
terms
of
your
main
hypo,
your
first
hypo,
i
don't
know
that
2(m)
even
comes
into
play
because
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
intermediate
supervisor
is
clearly
liable
under
2(a)
under
a
but-for
theory.
and
then
you
just
get
into
a
vicarious
liability
question.
i
don't
think
2(a)
gets
into
that.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
i
was
going
to
say
under
2(m)
though,
i
think
the
overriding
point
here
is
that
if
i
have
two
thoughts
in
my
head,
a
bad
one,
but
then
i
go
ahead
and
treat
the
person
the
same
way
i
would
have
anyhow,
then
i
have
done
what
under
title
vii,
generally
understood,
i
am
supposed
to
do,
which
is
i
treat
everyone
equally
regardless
of
the
bad
thought
in
my
head.
and
at
that
point
--
and
that's
why
mixed
motive
claims
really
threaten
to
take
the
statute
from
one
that
ensures
equal
treatment
to
one
that
goes
into,
you
know,
thought
control.
beyond
that,
i
will
take
the
advice
and
save
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daryl
l.
joseffer
thank
you.
this
case
seems
to
boil
down
to
two
very
simple
legislative
drafting
rules
or
interpretive
principles.
the
first
is,
from
gross,
we
know
that
congress
doesn't
relieve
the
plaintiff
of
the
traditional
burden
of
proof
unless
it
specifically
indicates
so.
and
so
then
we
talk
to
subsection
(m)
where
the
relevant
bases
are
the
litany
of
race,
color,
sex,
religion,
and
national
origin.
so
the
second
interpretive
principle
is,
then,
does
that
litany
here
encompass,
you
know,
complaining
about
unlawful
conduct
and
participating
in
an
investigation,
which
are
the
protected
conduct
for
purposes
of
retaliation.
that
principle
comes
straight
out
of
jackson
and
gomez-perez,
that
when
congress
broadly
refers
to
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
in
the
statute
without
greater
specificity,
the
court
will
read
retaliation
in.
when
congress
breaks
it
out,
the
surplusage
canon
--
and
i
agree
with
justice
scalia,
i
really
didn't
understand
why
they
were
talking
about
that
--
and
also
the
general
canon
is
the
same
canon,
which
is,
put
differently,
is
that
specific
provisions,
you
know,
control
over
general
ones,
they're
not
subsumed
within
them.
that
tells
us
that
when
congress
is
speaking
more
specifically,
it's
speaking
more
specifically.
here,
that
tells
congress
very
clearly
how
to
amend
these
statutes
when
it
wishes
to,
which
it
does
all
the
time,
and
how
the
courts
--
and
how
lower
courts
should
construe
them.
in
addition,
title
vii,
as
a
whole,
is
especially
clear,
because
the
same
subsection
2
within
title
vii,
when
it
wants
to
refer
to
all
types
of
employment
discrimination,
it
will
say
“
a
claim
of
employment
discrimination
”.
and
by
the
way,
the
1991
congress
put
that
provision
in
there.
so
this
congress
knew
how
to
say
“
any
claim
of
employment
discrimination
”,
as
it
did
so
in
subsection
(n),
which
comes
right
after
this
one.
congress
will
also
say
“
an
unlawful
employment
practice
”
when
it's
referring
to
all
of
them,
but
when
it
wants
to
specifically
refer
to
one
subset
or
another,
it
does
so.
that's
a
clear,
logical,
coherent
reading
of
the
statute
as
a
whole
that
every
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
question
has
adopted.
they're
asking
you
to
read
various
statutory
provisions
to
be
surplusage,
and
there's
simply
no
reason
to
do
so,
especially
because,
looking
just
at
1991,
congress
at
that
point
was
not
saying,
oh,
in
light
of
jackson,
we
can
now
just
speak
more
generally.
because
it,
specifically
in
1991,
cross-referenced
the
anti-retaliation
provision
of
title
vii
when
it
wanted
to,
and
it
specifically
used
broader
phrases
like
“
a
claim
of
employment
discrimination
”
when
it
wanted
to.
and
especially
since
the
whole
point
of
gross,
or
much
of
the
point
of
gross
was
to
replace
a
--
a
totally
unworkable
and
confusing
regime
with
something
that
is
clear
and
straightforward,
you've
done
that.
and
the
question
now
is
whether
to
retreat
back
into
a
jurisprudential
morass
where,
within
the
very
same
statute,
the
drafting
rules
this
court
has
otherwise
articulated,
no
longer
apply.
the
final
point
i'd
make
is
that,
yeah,
there's
this
question
about
are
--
are
we
treating,
you
know,
retaliation
and
--
and
substantive
discrimination
differently
within
one
statute,
and
the
answer
is,
well,
yes,
as
congress
did.
the
other
way
of
looking
at
it
is
they
want
to
treat
retaliation
differently
in
this
statute
than
it's
treated
in
every
other
statute.
you
can
--
you
can
point
to
similar
anomalies
across
the
board,
the
reason
being
that
congress
has
chosen
to
have
two
different
sections
within
this
area.
and--
