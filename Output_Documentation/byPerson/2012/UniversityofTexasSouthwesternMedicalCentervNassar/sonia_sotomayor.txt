i'm
sorry,
i
somehow
lost
what
you
were
saying.
isn't
the
law,
and
our
presumption
in
jackson,
that
when
we
talk
about
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
that
it
includes
retaliation
generally?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
different
because
it
was
the
beginning
of
this
sort
of
endeavor
of
creating
a
statute.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
what
difference
it
makes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
other
than
in
the
outcome
you
want
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
do
you
see
that
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
it
--
it
calls
it
the
same
thing
it
calls
the
substantive
discrimination
charge,
an
un
--
it's
a
--
an
unfair
employment
practice.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
how
you
--
where
you
get
to
your
policy
point--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--from
the
fact
that
it
calls
it
the
same
thing
on
both
substantive.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
calls
it
both
identical
things,
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
policy
argument
just
says
jackson's
wrong.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
just
doesn't
make
any
--
much
sense
to
me
that
in
1991,
when
they
were
thinking
about
price
waterhouse
burdens,
that
somehow
they
thought
that
it
should
now
apply
that
burden
differently
to
retaliation.
