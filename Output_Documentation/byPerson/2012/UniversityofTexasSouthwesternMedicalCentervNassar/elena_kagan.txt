justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
guess
the
question,
mr.
joseffer,
is,
is
there
any
other
discrimination
statute
in
which
one
can
say
that
there's
a
different
standard
for
proving
retaliation
than
there
is
for
proving
substantive
discrimination?
because
as
i
sort
of
survey
the
universe,
it
seems
as
though
whatever
the
standard
is,
the
standard
is
the
same
for
both,
and
there's
no
statute
in
which
the
two
have
been
divorced.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
i'll
try
again.
is
there
any
other
statute
in
which
we
have
a
different
standard
of
causation
for
a
retaliation
claim
than
we
do
for
a
substantive
discrimination
claim?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
is
there
--
i
mean,
it's
but-for
everywhere.
is
there
even
any
time
at
which
whatever
the
standard
that
applied,
you
know,
pre-gross,
is
there
ever
a
moment
and
is
there
ever
a
statute
in
the
history
of
antidiscrimination
laws
where
there
has
been
a
divorce,
a
different
standard
for
retaliation
than
for
substantive
discrimination?
justice
elena
kagan
all
i'm
saying,
you
know,
gross
was
a
couple
of
years
ago.
it
said
but-for
covers
the
--
the
aba
and
outside
title
vii.
you
know,
we've
had
a
lot
of
discrimination
statutes
since
1964.
we've
had
a
lot
of
different
standards
applying
to
those
discrimination
statutes
since
1964.
and
you're
coming
in
here
and
asking
for
the
first
time
in
all
of
those
many
decades
that
we
should
divorce
the
retaliation
claim
from
the
substantive
discrimination
claim
and
make
them
follow
two
different
standards;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
joseffer,
i
mean,
title
vii
is
written
before
any
of
these
cases
come
along.
so
title
vii
is
written
and
it
says
we
have
an
anti
--
you
know,
a
substantive
antidiscrimination
provision,
and
we
have
a
retaliation
provision.
and
then
the
court
starts
issuing
cases.
and
it
says,
by
the
way,
you
actually
don't
need
both.
one
will
do
the
job
for
you,
because
one
includes
the
other.
and
that's
in
sullivan.
and
that's
in
jackson.
and
that's
in
gomez-perez,
and
i'm
sure
i
am
missing
a
few.
three,
four,
five
times,
the
court
says
this.
so
then
in
1991
congress
comes
back
and
it
says,
we
want
to
make
some
amendments,
what
do
we
have
to
do?
do
we
have
to
amend
both,
the
anti
--
the
substantive
provision
and
the
retaliation
provision?
well,
no,
we
have
been
told
five
times
that
as
long
as
we
say
one
it
means
both.
and
so
that's
what
congress
does
in
1991.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but,
mr.
joseffer,
in
cbocs,
we
said
that
because
of
sullivan
alone,
just
because
of
sullivan,
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
exclude
explicit
language
about
retaliation.
in
other
words,
we
--
we
said
sullivan
made
the
point
clear.
now,
justice
alito
was
right.
after
that,
it
goes
on.
we
have
done
it
many
more
times
after
1991.
but
we
have
said
that
sullivan
itself
made
the
point
clear
that
you
did
not
need
explicit
language
about
retaliation.
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
here's
what
you're
ask
--
this
goes
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
--
but
here's
what
you're
asking
us
to
accept,
mr.
joseffer.
congress
comes
along
in
1991
in
a
world
in
which
there
has
--
there
have
never
been
separate
standards
for
retaliation
and
substantive
discrimination.
congress
is
trying
to
codify
and
make
even
stronger
the
price
waterhouse
decision,
right?
they
--
you
know,
they
say,
basically,
we
like
price
waterhouse,
but
it's
kind
of
confused
and
the
court
was
kind
of
fractured.
we're
going
to
really
put
it
into
place
legislatively.
they
do
that,
they
follow
the
--
essentially
the
drafting
manuals
that
we
have
given
them
in
sullivan.
and
you're
saying,
well,
no.
what
they
really
meant
was
that
retaliation
would
have
a
different
standard
and,
indeed,
retaliation
would
have
a
standard
that
the
dissenting
justices
suggested
in
price
waterhouse,
notwithstanding
what
congress
was
clearly
intending
to
do
was
codify
the
majority
--
the
plurality-plus
position.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
gross
is
talking
about
outside
of
title
vii.
and
--
and
whatever
might
be
said
of
gross
outside
of
title
vii,
here,
where
congress
is
specifically
trying
to
make
title
vii
conform
with
price
waterhouse,
with
the
backdrop
of
our
legislative
drafting
instructions,
and
with
the
backdrop
of
never
distinguishing
between
retaliation
and
antidiscrimination,
you
know,
how
do
you
get
to
where
you
want
to
be?
this
would
be,
like
--
talk
about
elephants
in
mouse
holes
or
talk
about
--
you
know,
we
can
take
up
all
our
cliches,
the
dog
that
didn't
bark.
you
know,
congress
doesn't
do
things
like
this
without
saying
something.
