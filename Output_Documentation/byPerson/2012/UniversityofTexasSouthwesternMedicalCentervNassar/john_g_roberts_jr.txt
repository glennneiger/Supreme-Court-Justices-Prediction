thank

mr.
lauten.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

over
a
powerful
dissent.

but
it
would
have
been
so
easy.
there
--
it's
--
it's
a
set,
race,
color,
religion,
sex
or
national
origin.
and
why
would
they
leave
it
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
would
they
leave
"or
in
violation
of
section
2000e-3(a)?

i
know
your
argument
is
well,
look,
the
court's
already
said
well,
that's
--
that's
included,
but
they've
got
two
provisions
fairly
close
to
each
other,
and
i
don't
know,
if
they're
running
through
the
usual
list,
why
they
wouldn't
have
just
run
through
a
list
as
it
appeared
in
(g)(2)(a).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

thank
you,

where
are
they
--
where
are
they
going
to
be
weeded
out?
on
summary
judgment
or
on
--
after
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
before
you
do
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
i
understood
we
are
talking
about
what
possible
reason
there
could
be
for
drawing
this
distinction.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
protection
against
discrimination
--
race,
color,
religion,
sex
--
that
sets
forth
the
basic
principle
of
--
of
fair
and
equal
treatment.
the
anti-retaliation
provision
is
more
functional.
the
way
you
protect
against
that
discrimination
is
you
make
sure
people
don't
retaliate
when
they
complain
about
it.
now
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
order
of
--
of
hierarchy,
removed
from
the
basic
principle.
so
perhaps
you
would
have
a
different
standard
of
causation
when
you
deal
with
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
--
i
think
that
was
my
point,
that
they
are
linked
together
but
they
are
at
different
levels.
i
mean,
the
--
you
protect
against
retaliation
so
that
the
protection
against
race,
color,
national
origin
can
be
vindicated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
joseffer,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,

justice
kennedy
also
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-484,
university
of
texas
southwestern
medical
center
versus
nassar.
