justice

scalia
i
can't
understand
you
very
well.
could
you
--
maybe
you
have
to
lift
up
your
mike,
or
maybe
you
have
to
speak
more
slowly.
but
i'm
having
an
awful
time
following
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
they
--
why
did
they
include
it
in
a
separate
section?
if
they
knew
that,
why
did
they
have
a
separate
section
on
retaliation?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
why
did
they
do
it
if
they
knew
it
was
already
included?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
really
don't
understand
--
i
didn't
understand
the
law
to
be
that.
you
mean
if
an
employee
files
a
discrimination
claim,
and
then
is
fired
--
let's
assume
there
is
no
other
reason
except
retaliation;
he's
fired
for
filing
that
claim
--
he
has
to
prove
not
only
that
he
was
fired
in
retaliation
for
filing,
but
also
that
his
claim
was
valid?
is
that
what
you
are
saying
the
law
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
saying.
i
thought
that's
what
justice
alito's
question
asked.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
his
hypothetical,
he
did.
justifiable
retaliation,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
i
mean,
the
employer
files
a
frivolous
claim
to
embarrass
the
employer.
he
can't
erase
that
from
his
mind.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
he
fired
this
guy.
and
you
say:
ooh,
if
that's
one
of
the
reasons,
no
matter
how
frivolous
or
anything
else,
he's
liable
under
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
do
you
understand
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
not
under
this
statute.
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
the
text
of
this
statute,
which
simply
destroys
your
argument
that
there's
no
difference
between
retaliation
and
race
discrimination.
section
2000e-5(g)(2)(a)
limits
remedies
where
a
defendant
acted
--
and
this
is
a
quote
from
the
statute
--
"for
any
reason
other
than
discrimination
on
--
on
account
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin,
or
in
violation
of
section
2000e-3(a)
of
this
title.
"
it
--
it
separates
out
2000e-3(a),
retaliation,
from
the
other
aspects
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
sir,
the
statute
says
what
it
says.
it
doesn't
matter
when
congress
put
it
in
there.
the
statute
has
to
be
read
as
a
whole.
and
if
you
read
it
as
a
whole,
this
provision
clearly
separates
out
retaliation
from
race
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
period.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
--
i
don't
have
to
psychoanalyze
congress
and
say
did
they
really
mean
it,
blah,
blah,
blah.
it's
there
in
the
statute.
they
didn't
take
it
out.
the
statute
still
makes
a
clear
distinction
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
might
be
a
good
idea,
though,
and
--
and
if
so,
congress
can
do
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
issue
is
whether
this
statute
does
it
or
not.
the
fact
that
nobody
has
ever
done
it
before,
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
don't
understand.
say
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
talk
about
congress
as
though
it's
a
continuing
body
out
there,
the
same
people,
and
would
the
same
people
that
did
this
do
that.
they
are
not
the
same
people.
i
don't
know
what
congress
it
was
that
passed
this
particular
act
versus
other
antidiscrimination
acts.
some
of
them
may
have
been
democratic
congresses
and
others
may
have
been
republican
congresses.
to
--
to
assume
that
there
is
one
congress
out
there
that
--
that
has
to
operate
logically
in
all
these
areas,
it
seems
to
me
unrealistic.
and
--
and
the
best
thing
we
can
be
guided
by
is
simply
the
text
that
congress
adopted,
however
the
makeup
of
that
congress
happened
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
maxim
that
you
don't
add
words
where
you
don't
need
them
doesn't
--
doesn't
help
your
case.
it
hurts
your
case,
because
in
the
other
provision
that
was
carried
over
from
the
prior
law,
you
--
you
were
making
a
nullity
of
the
--
the
addition
after
referring
to
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
of,
you
know,
retaliation.
