justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
did
this
court
ever
hold
that
a
price
waterhouse
framework
applied
to
retaliation
claims?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
as
of
1991
--
well,
gomez-perez
and
jackson
came
after
1991,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
as
of
1991,
was
there
any
case,
any
decision
of
this
court
other
than
sullivan,
that
could
have
possibly
led
congress
to
a
conclusion
that
the
general
prohibition
against
discrimination
included
a
prohibition
of
retaliation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
take
you
back
to
your
opening
statement
that
there
is
no
reason
why
congress
might
have
wanted
to
have
a
different
standard
for
substantive
discrimination
and
retaliation.
would
you
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
the
motivating
factor
analysis
creates
special
problems
in
the
retaliation
--
in
the
retaliation
context?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
know
it's
not
going
to
go
away.
let
me
give
you
this
example,
this
hypothetical.
an
employee
thinks
that
he
is
about
to
be
fired.
and
let's
--
let's
suppose
that
the
employer
really
has
a
good,
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
firing
the
employee.
on
the
eve
of
that
the
employee
makes
a
spurious
charge
of
discrimination
and
does
it
in
a
way
to
maximize
the
embarrassment
to
the
employer.
then
the
employer
formally
makes
the
decision
to
terminate
the
employee.
and
what
the
employer
says
at
that
time
is,
we
were
going
to
fire
so
and
so
anyway
for
all
these
other
reasons,
but
now
because
he
has
done
this
and
really
embarrassed
us
publicly,
we
are
really
happy
that
we
are
going
to
fire
him.
now,
how
does
that
work
out
under
the
motivating
factor
analysis?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
correct?
can't
you
--
can't
you
succeed
on
a
retaliation
claim
if
your
underlying
substantive
claim
is
invalid.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
no,
i
understand
that.
and
it's
not
a
policy
question.
it's
a
question
of
interpreting
the
statute.
but
i
understood
your
lead
argument
in
favor
of
a
particular
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
be
it
can't
mean
what
the
petitioner
wants
it
to
mean,
what
the
petitioner
says
it
means,
because
that
would
make
no
sense.
and
the
point
of
my
question
was
to
explore
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
very
good
reason
why
congress
would
want
a
different
causation
standard
for
substantive
discrimination
and
retaliation.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
price
waterhouse
is
a
little
different
from
subsection
(m)
though,
isn't
it?
you
have
to
have
proof
of
--
you
have
to
have
direct
evidence
of
a
substantial
--
direct
and
substantial
evidence
before
you
get
into
price
waterhouse,
right?
you
don't
need
that
under
subsection
(m).
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
it
the
case
that
justice
o'connor's
opinion
in
price
waterhouse
required
direct
evidence
and
substantial
evidence
before
there
was
a
shift
in
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
--
that's
a
fair
point,
but
it's,
like,
if
we
change
it
a
little
bit
so
that
it's
--
it's
not
frivolous,
but
it
is
clearly
groundless
once
its
examined,
then
you
still
have
the
problem.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
problem
is--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
problem
is
this:
it's
one
thing
to
say,
and
it's
a
good
thing
to
say
to
employers:
when
you
are
making
employment
decisions,
you
take
race
out
of
your
mind,
take
gender
out
of
your
mind,
take
national
origin
out
of
your
mind.
it's
not
something
you
can
even
think
about.
but
when
you
are
talking
about
retaliation,
when
you
are
talking
about
an
employer
who
has
been,
perhaps
publicly,
charged
with
discrimination
and
the
employer
knows
that
the
charge
is
not
a
good
charge,
it's
pretty
--
it's
very,
very
difficult
to
say
to
that
employer
and
very
difficult
for
the
employer
to
say:
i'm
going
to
take
this
completely
out
of
my
mind.
i'm
not
even
going
to
think
about
the
fact
that
i
am
--
have
been
wrongfully
charged
with
discrimination.
isn't
that
a
real
difference?
