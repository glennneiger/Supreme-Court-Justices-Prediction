in
the
--
in
the
aids
discrimination
context,
there
wouldn't
be
a
difference
between
the
discrimination
claim
itself
and
the
retaliation.
they'd
both
be
governed
by
the
same
standard,
isn't
that
right,
in
the
age
discrimination
area,
the
but-for
causation?
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
argument
is
that
in
title
vii,
where
it's
very
clear
what
the
standard
congress
wants
to
have
for
the
discrimination
claim,
you're
going
to
have
a
different
standard
for
retaliation.
so,
in
these
statutes,
i
thought
these
two
traveled
together,
whatever
the
standard
is
for
discrimination
is
the
same
for
retaliation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
seems
that
the
overall
purpose
of
the
'91
act
was
to
overrule
decisions
of
this
court
that
congress
thought
had
not
interpreted
title
vii
properly.
and
am
i
right
that
what
they
put
about
motivating
factor,
a
motivating
factor,
that
is
more
plaintiff-friendly
than
the
--
than
the
standard
that
the
court
declared
in
--
in
price
waterhouse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
--
it's
really
odd
to
think
that
in
wanting
to
go
beyond
what
we
did
in
price
waterhouse,
the
court
meant
to
set
up
an
entirely
different
standard
for
--
for
retaliation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
look
at
what
they
actually
did.
if
we
look
at
this
(m)
section,
it
says,
"except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
subchapter.
"
i
take
it
that
would
include
retaliation
as
well,
in
the
subchapter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
"--
an
unlawful
employment
practice
is
established.
"
and
then
when
we
go
over
to
the
retaliation
provision,
it
says,
"it
shall
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
"
so
why
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
--
“
an
employment
practice
”
under
the
retaliation
provision
is
the
same
as
“
an
employment
practice
”
under
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
eeoc
didn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
alternate
argument
would
--
would
involve
two
standards,
the
one
that
congress
provided
for
substantive
discrimination,
the
--
the
improvement
on
--
on
price
waterhouse,
and
then
for
retaliation,
price
waterhouse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
started
this
--
this
argument
by
asking,
is
there
--
in
the
realm
of
anti-discrimination
law,
is
there
any
example
where
you
have
the
--
the
substantive
charge
governed
by
one
standard
and
retaliation
by
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
two
of
the
decisions
announced
today,
the
court
has
corralled
title
vii,
an
act
designed
to
stomp
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin
in
our
nation's
work
places.
both
decisions
dilute
the
strength
of
title
vii
in
ways
congress
could
not
have
intended.
for
that
reason,
justices
breyer,
sotomayor,
kagan,
and
i
dissent.
the
decision
justice
alito
just
announced,
vance
v.
ball
state
university,
answers
the
question,
who
is
the
supervisor
for
title
vii
purposes?
the
answer
is
important
because
this
court
has
held
that
an
employer
is
vicariously
liable
for
a
supervisor's
harrassing
conduct.
if
the
harasser
is
a
co-worker
and
not
a
supervisor,
however,
we
have
held
that
the
employer
is
not
responsible
unless
the
victim
of
the
harassment
proves
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
to
do
so,
the
employee
must
show
that
the
employer
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
harassing
conduct
and
failed
to
stop
it.
that
is
a
burden
not
easily
carried.
an
employee
may
have
a
reputation
as
a
harasser
among
those
in
his
vicinity,
but
if
no
complaint
makes
its
way
up
to
management,
the
employer
will
escape
liability.
the
supervisor
co-worker
distinction
makes
sense
and
employee
can
walk
away
from
harassing
co-worker
or
tell
him
just
to
buzz
off.
the
harassment
of
a
supervisor,
however,
is
harder
to
avoid,
given
the
control
rein
held
by
an
in-charge
superior.
so,
who
qualifies
as
a
supervisor?
all
agree
that
an
employee
with
authority
to
take
tangible
employment
actions
that
is
to
hire,
fire,
promote,
demote
qualifies.
in
addition,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
the
agency
charged
with
interpretation
and
administration
of
title
vii
defines
as
a
supervisor,
not
vaguely,
but
simply
as
one,
authorized
to
direct
other
employees
daily
work
activities.
notably,
the
eeocs
definition
was
accepted
by
both
plaintiff
and
defendant
in
this
case.
yet
the
court
rejects
it
and
confines
the
supervisory
category
to
those
authorized
to
take
tangible
employment
actions.
who
does
that
leave
out?
a
typical
and
not
at
all
hypothetical
example;
a
female
highway
maintenance
worker
is
giving
assignments
by
employees
called
lead
workers.
sex
based
invectives
are
hurled
at
the
female
worker
and
a
pornographic
image
is
taped
to
her
locker.
the
lead
worker
forces
her
to
wash
her
truck
in
subzero
weather,
assigns
her
to
undesirable
yard
work
instead
of
road
crew
work,
and
directs
other
employees
to
give
her
no
aid
in
fixing
a
malfunctioning
heating
system
in
her
truck.
harrassing
conduct,
conceitedly,
yes.
was
the
lead
worker
in
charge
of
the
harassed
employee's
daily
work
assignments?
certainly,
but
the
lead
worker
lacked
authority
to
hire
or
fire
or
take
other
tangible
employment
actions,
so
under
today's
decision
the
lead
worker
would
be
ranked
merely
a
co-worker
not
supervisor.
as
anyone
with
employment
experience
can
easily
grasp
in-charge
employees
authorized
to
assign
and
control
subordinate
employees
daily
work
are
aided
in
accomplishment
--
in
accomplishing
the
harassment
by
the
superintending
position
in
which
their
employer
places
them,
and
for
that
reason,
the
employer
is
properly
held
responsible
for
their
misconduct.
the
court's
disregard
for
the
realities
of
the
workplace
means
that
many
victims
of
workplace
harassment
will
have
no
effective
remedy.
the
result,
title
vii's
capacity
to
prevent
and
redress
discriminatory
conduct
is
diminished.
i
turn
now
to
the
decision
and
now
inspire
justice
kennedy,
university
of
texas
southwestern
medical
center
against
nassar.
dr.
nassar,
a
physician
of
middle
eastern
descent,
resigned
from
his
position
on
the
medical
faculty
of
the
university
and
in
a
letter
to
the
chair
of
internal
medicine
nassar
attributed
his
resignation
to
his
superior's
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
his
race,
religion,
and
national
origin.
nassar
charged
that
in
retaliation
for
his
complaints
about
his
supervisor,
the
university
blocked
his
employment
at
an
affiliated
hospital.
retaliation
in
response
to
complaints
of
workplace
discrimination
is
proscribed
by
title
vii.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
jury
verdict
in
nassar's
favor.
the
court
today
vacates
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
and
holds
that
nassar
cannot
prevail
unless
he
shows
that
the
university
would
not
have
taken
the
same
action,
absent
a
design
to
retaliate
against
him.
the
court
reaches
this
conclusion
not
withstanding
a
provision
of
title
vii
2
(m)
explicitly
instructing
that
a
plaintiff
need
show
only
that
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin
was
a
motivating
factor
in
an
adverse
employment
decision
and
employer's
proof
that
other
fact
is
also
a
motivated
the
decision
will
not
defeat
the
plaintiff's
claim.
section
2
(m)
is
not
in
point,
the
court
says
because
the
provision
applies
only
to
claims
alleging
discrimination
based
on
protective
characteristics
and
does
not
cover
retaliation.
in
so
holding,
the
court
departs
from
a
line
of
our
decisions
unbroken
until
today,
teaching
that
retaliation
for
complaining
about
discrimination
based
on
protected
characteristics
is
a
form
of
discrimination
based
on
those
characteristics.
the
court's
departure
from
precedent
recognizing
this
simple
truth
is
particularly
imprudent
in
nassar's
case.
section
2
(m)
was
added
to
title
vii
as
part
of
the
1991
civil
rights
act
passed
in
response
to
several
decisions
of
this
court
that
sharply
cut
back
on
the
scope
and
effectiveness
of
antidiscrimination
laws.
in
reading
(2)
(m),
to
exclude
retaliation
claims
the
court
has
seized
on
a
provision
enacted
to
strengthen
title
vii
and
turned
it
into
a
measure,
reducing
the
force
of
the
ban
on
retaliation.
six
years
ago
in
ledbetter
against
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company,
the
court
read
title
vii
in
a
similarly
restrictive
way.
in
2009,
congress
corrected
that
error.
today,
the
ball
again
lies
in
congress'
court
to
correct
this
court's
wayward
interpretations
of
title
vii.
