ms.
melissa
arbus

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
start,
justice
alito,
with
your
question
as
to
why
it
would
make
sense
or
why
it
might
make
sense
for
congress
to
adopt
a
different
causation
standard
with
respect
to
substantive
discrimination
on
the
one
hand
and
retaliation
on
the
other.
and
what
that
question
reveals
is
what,
justice
kagan,
you
had
mentioned.
there
is
not
a
single
statute
that
petitioner
can
point
to
and
not
a
single
statute
that
i
am
aware
of
where
congress
has
ever
expressly
adopted
two
different
causation
standards
with
respect
to
intentional
discrimination
under
the
same
statute.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
and
on
that--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
--
and
i
want
to
address
that
because
i
don't
think
that's
quite
right.
you
can't
just
scream
“
discrimination
”
when
you're,
you
know,
when
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
and
you
know
you're
going
to
get
fired.
as
this
court
recognized
in
clark
county,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly
in
opposition
cases
required
there
to
be
a
reasonable
good
faith
belief
that
the
discrimination
actually
occurred.
so
if
we
are
talking
about
truly
frivolous
claims,
i
know
i
am
going
to
get
fired,
you
know,
i
might
as
well
say
my
boss
is,
you
know,
sexually
harassing
me,
that's
not
going
to
happen;
those
cases
are
going
to
be
weeded
out.
the
other
point
i
would
make--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--at
summary
judgment.
and
they
are
weeded
out
at
summary
judgment.
in
cases
--
there
needs
to
be
a
protected
activity,
and
it
is
not
a
protected
activity
if
your
claim
of
discrimination
--
you
don't
have
a
reasonable
belief
in
that
claim.
again,
you
can't
just
scream
“
discrimination
”
as
they
are
kicking
you
out
the
door.
the
other
point
i
would--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
then
i
don't
think
it's
as
severe
of
a
problem
as
your
honor
is
suggesting,
for
a
couple
of
different
reasons.
number
one,
if
you
are
positing
a
situation
where
there
is
clear
evidence
that
the
employer
would
have
made
the
same
decision
regardless,
that
is
a
defense
that
is
available
to
the
employer
and
there
is
no
reason
they
couldn't
seek
partial
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
that.
that
severely
limits
the
remedies
that
are
available.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
in
circumstances
where
the
employer
would
have
made
the
same
decision--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--even
without
the
improper
motive--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--that
is
a
defense
under
(g)(2)(b),
and
it's
something
that
the
employer
could
certainly
raise
under
partial
summary
judgment
that
would
severely
limit
the
remedies
available.
the
other
point
i
would
is
it
does
still
needs
to
be
a
motivating
factor.
it
needs
to
actually
play
a
role
in
the
employment
decision,
and
so
that
is
the
standard.
and
it's
a
standard
that,
you
know,
that
congress
has
adopted
clearly
with
respect
to
substantive
discrimination
claims.
and
if
i
could
turn
now
to
the
language
of
the
statute
because
that
is
our
primary
argument.
if
you
look
at
the
language--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--sure.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
and
i
don't
think
it
is,
for
the
reasons
that
this
court
talked
about
in
burlington
northern
and
in
thompson
and
in
crawford.
and
what
the
court
said
in
those
cases
is
that
the
two
are
linked
together.
you
do
need
to
have
robust
retaliation
protections
in
order
to
ensure
that
that
primary
purpose,
that
discrimination,
is
outside
of
the
workplace.
and
so
if
employees
are
worried
or
afraid
to
come
forward
and
report
discrimination,
the
discrimination
is
going
to
persist.
it's
not
going
to
be
remedied.
and
so
the
two
are
linked
together
and
it
makes
sense
to
have
the
same--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor.
i
think
you
--
that
is
the
reason
you
protect
against
retaliation.
and
in
order
to
have
sufficient
protections
so
that
interest
can
be
vindicated,
individual
employees
need
to
feel
comfortable
coming
forward.
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
and
you
have
a--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
don't
think
it
is
and
i
think
it's
significant
if
we
are
talking
about
distinguishing
between
retaliation
--
it's
significant
that
congress
in
a
number
of
whistleblower
statutes,
so
specifically
retaliation
statutes,
has
adopted
a
contributing
factor,
a
motivating
factor
standard,
and
in
fact
has
adopted
a
same-decision
defense
where
you
need
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
so
i
think
congress's
judgment
is
that
that
distinction
is
not
one
that
should
be
made,
that
it
is--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--and
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
i
am
actually
happy
to
turn
to
the
text.
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
language
of
subsection
(m)
and
it's
on
page
15a
of
our
brief.
and
if
you
follow
that
language,
it
starts
off
very
plainly
saying
as
"except
as
otherwise
provided
in
subchapter
(m),
unlawful
employment
practice
is
established.
"
this
is
a
means
of
proving
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
and
we
know
when
you
look
at
3a,
which
is
on
page
17a
of
our
brief,
that
retaliation
is
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
congress
used
that
phrase
“
unlawful
employment
practice
”
in
subsection
(m).
it's
an
unadorned
phrase.
it
didn't
limit
it.
it
didn't
say
“
under
this
section
”;
it
didn't
say
“
under
section
2000e-2(a)
”.
it
said
“
unlawful
employment
practice
”.
and
if
you
continue
on:
"when
the
complaining
party
demonstrates
that
race,
color,
religion,
sex
or
national
origin
was
a
motivating
factor.
"
and
we
know
under
this
court's
cases
under
gomez-perez,
under
cbocs,
under
jackson
and
sullivan
that
race
is
a
motivating
factor
in
an
employment
decision
that
is
based
on
retaliation
when
you've
complained
about
race
discrimination.
and
so
the
language
of
(m),
the
plain
language,
clearly
encompasses
the
retaliation
claims
in
title
vii.
and
so
the
only
argument,
i
believe,
that
petitioner
is
making
is
that
there
are
things
elsewhere
in
the
statute
that
might
make
you
think
otherwise
here.
and
we
would
argue
that
none
of
them--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--i
think
that
defines
what
the
protected
activity
is.
i
don't
think
it
is
any
different
than
in
jackson
or
gomez-perez.
in
those
cases,
it
was
a
general
discrimination
provision,
but
once
retaliation
claims
are
recognized,
there
--
there
still
actually
needs
to
be
protected
activity.
there
has
to
be
opposition,
there
has
to
be
participation
of
some
sort.
and
so
i
don't
think
it's
any
different
in
that
respect.
justice
scalia,
you
were
talking
about
g-2(a),
and
if
i
could
just
take
a
moment
on
that,
because
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
petitioner
is
making.
my
colleague
made
the
point
that
it
was
adopted
by
the
1964
congress;
it
was
adopted
before
sullivan.
and
so
if
i
could
focus
on
the
1991
congress
that
enacted
both
subsection
(m)
and
subsection
g-2(b),
that
congress
was
acting
in
light
of
sullivan.
and
we
know
it
was
legislating
with
full
knowledge
of
sullivan,
because
that's
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
cbocs.
cbocs
involved
section
101,
rather,
of
the
1991
act;
this
involves
section
107
of
the
1991
act.
so
we
know
that
when
congress
was
writing
(m)
and
when
it
was
writing
g-2(b),
it
knew,
because
of
sullivan,
that
it
didn't
need
extra
words.
it
didn't
need
redundant
words.
it
didn't
have
to
say
under
section
2000e-2
and
section
2000e-3;
it
could
simply
say
exactly
what
it
said
in
(m),
and
that
would
do
the
trick.
and
it's
a
common
rule
of
statutory
interpretation
that
you
don't
add
extra
words
if
you
don't
need
them.
and
so
what
congress
did
in
(m)
is
it
adopted
exactly
what
words
it
needed
to
effectuate
its
purpose,
which
is
to
have
one
causation
standard,
a
motivating
factor
standard
available
with
respect
to
all
intentional
discrimination
claims--
ms.
melissa
arbus
sherry
--your
honor,
may
i?
to
answer
that
question,
it's
important
--
what
happened
in
1991,
congress
didn't
add
that
language,
it
didn't
amend
that
language;
it
simply
didn't
delete
it.
and
i
think
it's
completely
reasonable
when
congress
is
faced
with
a
choice
of
deleting
language
that
had
been
there
for
25
years
that
wasn't
a
problem,
it's
just
at
worst
was
redundant,
chose
to
leave
it
in
place
lest
any
negative
inference
arise
from
the
deletion,
and
simply
legislate
in
subsection
(m),
in
g-2(b),
based
on
the
new
understanding
that
the
court
adopted
in
sullivan.
