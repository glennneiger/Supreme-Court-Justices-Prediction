do
--
do
you
agree
with
the
government's
position
that
the
limited
affirmative
defense
provisions
congress
enacted,
that
is
to
say,
limited
damages
when
there's
multiple
or
mixed
motives
would
also
apply
to
retaliation
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
thrust
of
justice
alito's
question
was
that
retaliation
claims
are
--
are
now
quite
common,
and
they
can
almost
be
used
as
a
defensive
mechanism,
as
a
defense
when
you
know
you
are
about
to
be
hired.
and
if
that's
true,
shouldn't
we
be
very
careful
about
the
causation
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
--
so
that
--
that
was
the
thrust
of
--
of
his
question.
justice
anthony

well,
but
under
--
under
that
analysis,
you
don't
need
the

of

of

“

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
the
law
grants
persons
the
right
to
compensation
for
injury
from
wrongful
conduct,
there
must
be
some
demonstrated
connection,
some
link
between
the
injury
sustained
and
the
wrong
that's
alleged.
and
that
connection
between
wrong
and
the
injury
is
governed
principles
of
causation
and
this
case
requires
the
court
to
define
those
causation
rules
and
the
context
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
particularly
with
reference
to
employment
discrimination.
that
act
provides
remedies
to
employees
who
are
injured
by
employment
discrimination
and
in
this
case,
the
court
discusses
the
causation
rules
for
two
categories
of
employer
conduct
that's
prohibited
by
title
vii.
the
first
is
what
we
call
“status-based
discrimination,”
that
is
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin.
that
discrimination
is
made
unlawful
by
what
we
can
call
here
section
2
(a).
the
second
type
of
unlawful
conduct
is
under
the
act,
is
employer
retaliation
for
employee's
opposition
to
or
an
employee's
complaints
about
workplace
discrimination
and
retaliation
is
prohibited
by
section
3
(a),
so
there's
2
(a)
and
3
(a).
the
petitioner
here
is
the
university
of
texas
southwestern
medical
center,
respondent,
dr.
nassar
is
a
medical
doctor
of
middle
eastern
descent.
until
july
2006,
he
was
a
member
of
the
university
faculty
and
he
was
also
a
staff
physician
at
one
of
its
affiliated
hospitals.
now,
one
of
respondent's
university
supervisors
was
a
dr.
beth
levine.
and
levine
expressed
the
view
that
middle
easterners
are
lazy
and
she
gave
particularly
close
scrutiny
to
the
respondent's
billing
practices.
desiring
to
escape
levine's
oversight,
respondent
sought
an
arrangement
where
he
could
work
at
the
hospital
but
not
at
the
university
and
he
reached
a
tentative
deal
with
the
hospital.
then
he
quit
his
teaching
job
and
he
sent
various
administrators
a
letter
describing
levine's
alleged
harassment.
one
of
these
administrators
then
contacted
the
hospital
to
oppose
respondent's
hiring.
and
he
asserted
that
the
institutions
affiliation
agreement
reserved
staff
physician
post
for
faculty
members
and
the
doctor
was
no
longer
a
member
of
the
faculty.
so,
the
hospital
withdrew
its
offer.
respondent
then
filed
suit
in
federal
court.
he
alleged
the
university's
opposition
was
retaliation
for
his
having
complained
about
levine.
there
were
other
claims
as
well,
but
the
retaliation
claim
was
the
relevant
one
here.
and
on
that
claim,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
but
for
causation
was
not
required
and
applying
that
standard,
the
jury
found
for
the
respondent
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
this
court
addressed
that
issue
of
causation
and
employment
discrimination
in
a
1989
case,
called
price
waterhouse
versus
hopkins,
and
that
case
allowed
recovery
on
status-based
claims
under
a
lessened
causation
standard.
congress
then
amended
the
statute.
that
amendment
allowed
recovery
based
on
lessened
causation,
but
it
did
limit
the
remedies
that
are
available
when
that
test
was
applied.
then
in
the
case
of
gross
versus
fbl
financial
services
in
2009,
this
court
considered
a
different
statue
that
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
and
in
gross,
the
court
held
that
but
for
causation,
not
lessened
causation
was
applicable.
today,
the
court
again
interprets
title
vii
and
the
question
is
whether
the
provision
that
congress
amended,
a
provision
that
applies
but
its
terms
only
to
status-based
discrimination,
should
be
extended
so
that
it
also
includes
retaliation
claims.
and
today,
the
court
holds,
it
should
not
be
extended
to
those
claims
and
this
holding
is
consistent
with
the
reasoning
of
gross
and
the
analysis
is
based
on
an
interpretation
of
the
text
and
structure
of
title
vii.
title
vii's
retaliation
provision
makes
it
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
any
of
his
employees
because
he
has
opposed
or
supported
a
complaint
that
alleges
unlawful
employment
discrimination.
and
in
general,
requiring
proof
that
a
certain
effect
occurred
because
of
a
ceratin
action,
means
that
the
effect
would
not
have
happened
absent
that
action.
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
there
is
no
persuasive
reason
not
to
give
the
word
“because”
the
standard
meaning.
it
is
true,
as
respondent
argues
that
the
1991
amendment
provides
for
the
lessened
causation
standard
for
some
title
vii
claims,
but
that
provision
applies
by
its
own
terms
only
to
claims
alleging
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex
or
national
origin,
the
status-based
claims
that
were
noted
here
at
the
outset.
it
says
nothing
about
retaliation.
when
congress
created
that
lessened
causation
standard
in
1991,
it
added
this
as
a
part
of
section
2,
which
is
title
vii's
bar
on
status-based
discrimination,
rather
than
in
a
statutory
section
dealing
with
retaliation.
these
textural
and
structural
clues
as
well
as
others
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
the
opinion
show
that
retaliation
claims
must
be
proved
according
to
the
normal
rule
of
but
for
causation
and
these
requires
proof
that
allegedly
unlawful
action
would
not
have
occurred
in
the
absence
of
a
motive
to
retaliate.
because
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
lessened
causation
standard
rather
than
the
“but
for
standard”
the
statute
requires,
its
judgment
is
vacated.
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
bryer,
sotomayor,
and
kagan
join.
