mr.
brian
p.
lauten
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
it
does
not
make
any
sense
at
all
for
congress
to
have
created
two
causation
standards
under
the
same
statute
in
1991
without
saying
anything
about
it
at
all.
there
are
three
good
reasons
why
congress
had
not
to
amend
e-3(a)
in
1991.
the
first
is
in
1964,
that
is
when
e-3(a)
was
originally
drafted.
it
was
part
of
the
original
bill.
5
years
later,
in
1969
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park,
this
court
held
that
42
u.s.c.
1982
included
retaliation.
so
in
1981,
congress
knew
that
retaliation
was
encompassed
within
discrimination.
point
number
2--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--well,
when
congress
added
e-2
in,
justice
scalia,
it
supplemented
the
act.
it
created
a
new
provision
altogether.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
well,
they
didn't
have
to
amend
e-3(a)
because
there
were
policy
--
the
burlington
northern
case,
for
example,
where
this
court
held
that
retaliation
is
considerably
broader,
that
provision,
where
the
court
held
that
retaliation
in
burlington
actually
went
beyond
conditions
in
the
workplace.
that
was
the
second
reason.
and
the
third
reason
is,
imagine
if
they
had
amended
e-3(a)
or
if
they
had
deleted
or
repealed
it.
we
would
be
here
saying,
well,
why
did
they
do
that
if
they
had
already
knew
in
sullivan
since
1964,
why
would
they
amend
the
act?
e-2(m)
on
its
text
applies
to
e-3(a).
congress
could
have
very
well
put
an
e-2(m)
under
this
section.
it
could
have
very
well
put
an
e-2(m),
an
individual's
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
national
origin.
but
what
it
did
is
it
said
a
complaining
party
must
demonstrate,
and
then
it
lists
those
things.
and
then
it
says
“
for
any
employment
practice
”.
e-3(a)
specifically
defines
retaliation
as
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
so
the
text
of
e-2(m),
which,
again,
was
a
new
provision
altogether
--
congress
did
not
go
in
and
amend
e-2(a)
through
e-2(d)
as
it
easily
could
have
done,
but
it
created
a
new
provision.
the
motivating
factor--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--not
at
all,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
reason,
and
this
court
needs
to
keep
this
in
mind.
motivating
factor
causation
is
not
going
away
no
matter
what
this
court
holds
today.
it's
in
e-2(m),
it
is
going
to
apply
to
substantive
discrimination.
with
respect
to
how
it's
submitted--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--very
easily,
because
in
that
situation
the
employer
wouldn't
even
have
to
prove
the
affirmative
defense
because
the
employee
wouldn't
be
able
to
prove
a
violation
of
the
act
because
it
was
a
spurious
claim.
that's
point
number
1.
point
number--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--you
cannot
prevail
on
a
retaliation
claim
under
e-2(m)
without
proving
first
a
violation
of
the
act,
and
that
is
the
distinction
congress
made
in
e-2(m)
for
price
waterhouse,
whereas
price
waterhouse
held
there
was
no
violation
as
long
as
the
affirmative
defense
was
proven.
what
congress
did
in
1991
was
say
once
you
prove
a
motivating
factor
and
a
violation
of
the
act,
only
then
do
you
get
to
the
affirmative
defense.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
no,
no,
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
that
--
and
you
can
look
at
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case
--
you
would
have
to
prove
that
the
employer
acted
in
part
to
retaliate,
and
--
for
the
protected
activity.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
well,
here's
--
here's
our
position,
justice
scalia.
our
position,
number
one,
is
the
court
doesn't
even
get
to
that
issue
because
the
statute
applies.
if
e-2(m)
applies,
then
motivating
factor
causation
applies.
if
it
doesn't
apply,
if
the
court
rejects
our
statutory
argument,
then
by
default
we
are
under
the
price
waterhouse
framework
and
motivating
factor
causation
should
apply.
but
to
the
policy
question,
justice
alito--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--substantive
discrimination,
the
teeth
of
the
act,
relies
on
employees
being
able
to
cooperate
and
be
witnesses,
that
they
have
the
guts
to
come
forward.
if
you
take
that
protection
away,
you
are
taking
the
teeth
out
of
title
vii.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
in
1991
that
supports
that.
in
fact,
i
would
argue
the
contrary.
when
congress
passed
section
101
in
1991,
which
is
42
u.s.c.
1981,
in
that
provision
where
it
overruled
patterson
v.
mclean
and
the
court
held
that
retaliation
was
encompassed
within
the
substantive
discrimination
provision,
which
is
what
the
court
held
in
cbocs
v.
humphries,
in
the
house
bill
that
accompanied
the
act
it
said
that
congress
intended
for
retaliation
to
apply
to
section
101,
but
it's
not
in
the
section
at
all
that
became
101
that
was
in
cbocs.
in
gomez-perez
v.
potter,
as
you
well
know,
this
court
held
the
absence
of
retaliation
provision
under
the
federal
sector
provision
did
not
undermine
the
argument
that
retaliation
was
included,
even
though
congress
had
a
separate
anti-retaliation
provision
in
the
private
sector.
and
there
was
a
very
good
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals,
as
you
well
know,
that,
hey,
if
congress
wanted
an
anti-retaliation
provision,
why
wouldn't
they
have
done
so,
they
did
it
on
the
private
part.
and
there
were
arguments
the
other
way,
that
there
was
already
a
civil
service
remedy
in
place.
and
this
court
rejected
that
argument,
relied
on
sullivan,
jackson
v.
birmingham,
and
those
trilogy
of
cases--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--yes,
sir,
your
honor.
i
think
the
point
is
that
--
that
complaining
about
race
is
race
discrimination.
the
court
held
that
in
sullivan.
complaining
about
gender
discrimination
is
--
it's
gender
discrimination,
jackson
v.
birmingham.
complaining
about--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--retribution?
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
yes.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
if
--
if
i
understand
your
question,
what
i
would
default
to
are
the
three
or
four
cases
that
i
mentioned:
sullivan,
jackson
v.
birmingham,
cbocs
v.
humphries,
gomez-perez
v.
potter,
where
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
complaining
about
discrimination
is
intentional
discrimination.
and
i
want
to
bring
up--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--justice
scalia,
that's
incorrect,
and
this
is
why.
this
is
--
this
is
exactly
my
point.
5(g)(2)(a),
the
text
of
that,
that
was
drafted
by
the
1964
congress.
that
was
a
part
of
the
original
bill.
5
years
after
that
text
came
through,
this
court
held
in
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
that
retaliation
encompasses
discrimination.
so
why
in
1991
would
congress
go
amend
5(g)(2)(a)
from
1964,
when
it
already
knew.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
that
--
that--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--justice
scalia,
respectfully,
that
argument
is
directly
contrary
to
cbocs
v.
humphries,
and
it's
directly
contrary
to
gomez-perez,
where
this
court
held
that
congress
is
charged
with
knowing
what
this
court
is
deciding
prior
to
acting.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
why
would
they
leave
5(g)(2)(a)
out?
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
well,
here's
my
response
to
that.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
well,
this
is
really
important.
the
word
“
retaliation
”
is
nowhere
in
title
vii
at
all.
that's
point
number
1.
point
number
2
is,
if
--
congress
could
have
specifically
put
in
there
an
individual's
race,
color,
religion,
sex
or
national
origin,
and
clearly,
that
would
have
been
anchored
to
e-2(a)
to
e-2(d).
instead,
it
created
a
different
provision
altogether,
e-2(m),
and
specifically
said
a
complaining
party
demonstrates,
and
it
didn't
say
under
this
section,
and
it
defines
any
unlawful
employment
practice.
any.
and
then
if
you
look
at
e-3(a),
it
specifically
defines
what
we
refer
to
as
retaliation,
albeit
title
vii
doesn't
use
that
word,
as
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
now,
i
want
to
make
this
really
clear,
because
the
government
is
not
making
this
--
this
argument.
if
you
reject
our
statutory
argument,
if
you
reject
that
argument,
and
you
find
that
e-2(m)
does
not
govern
e-3(a),
although
we
strongly
urge
the
court
to
--
to
embrace
that
argument,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
done
as
well,
but
if
you
reject
that
argument
by
default,
we're
under
price
waterhouse
--
juries
have
been
instructed
since
jury
trials
started
in
1991
under
a
price
waterhouse
framework
in
retaliation
cases.
and
this
argument
about
unwarranted
retaliation
claims,
this
is
the
way
we've
been
doing
it
since
1991.
this
isn't
something
new.
juries
have
been
instructed
this
way
since
'91.
so
this
idea
about
creating
new
jurisprudence,
this
is
a
huge
step
backwards
from
the
framework
we've
been
working
under.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
just--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--no,
ma'am.
and
--
and
you
brought
up
a
great
point.
i
am
aware
--
true
to
justice
kagan's
point
earlier
--
i
am
aware
of
nowhere
in
american
history
of
congress
ever
creating
two
causation
standards
for
retaliation
and
discrimination,
especially
under
the
same
statute.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
well,
that's--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
to
interpret
the
act,
but
going
back
to
judge
ginsburg's--
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
--absolutely.
if
--
if
this
court
embraces
our
argument,
5(g)(2)(b)
would
apply
to
retaliation.
but
i
want
to
--
this
is
really
important.
judge
ginsburg
brought
up
a
great
point.
justice
ginsburg.
if
you
do
the
fallback
to
price
waterhouse,
it
doesn't
create
two
causation
standards.
the
juries
are
going
to
be
instructed
the
same
way.
the
only
thing
that's
going
to
happen
is
if
they
prove
the
affirmative
defense,
it's
a
complete
bar.
whereas,
if
you're
under
the
e-2(m)
amendment,
it
goes
to
the
remedy,
but
that
is
an
issue
at
the
time
of
judgment.
so
no,
there
--
there
won't
be
two
causation
standards
under
title
vii.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
i
don't
have
--
i
don't
have
an
answer
for
that.
the
answer
is,
i
do
not
know.
my
--
my
belief
is
that
e-2(m)
and
5(g)(2)(b)
--
the
distinction
e-2(m)
makes
is
that
it
makes
it
a
violation
of
the
act
to
prove
an
illegal
motive,
whereas
in
price
waterhouse,
you
haven't
violated
the
act
at
all
until
the
affirmative
defense
is
disproved.
so
that
that
is
the
distinction
with
e-2(m).
5(g)(2)(b)
just
goes
to
the
remedy,
whereas
the
affirmative
defense
of
price
waterhouse
was
a
complete
bar.
so
my
point
is,
is
that
even
if
the
court
by
default
finds
that
e-2(m)
does
not
apply,
you
are
not
exchanging
or
creating
two
standards.
all
that
is
going
to
happen
is
that
if
the
affirmative
defense
is
prevailed
upon
under
the
default
price
waterhouse
standard,
it's
a
complete
bar,
whereas
5(g)(2)(b)
limits
the
remedies.
that's
the
only
distinction.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
i
think
judge
--
i
think
justice
o'connor
in
her
concurrence
did
say
direct
evidence
under
price
waterhouse,
albeit
six
judges
agreed
in
1989
that
motivating
factor
causation
applies.
the
--
i
guess
the
last
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
this
court
really
needs
to
consider
this
record
on
its
face.
dr.
nassar,
after
going
through
months
of
discrimination,
finally
reports
that
he's
leaving.
in
this
record,
dr.
fitz
admitted
to
dr.
keiser.
dr.
keiser,
a
white
baptist
supervisor
to
dr.
nassar,
goes
and
--
and
reports
it.
mr.
brian
p.
lauten
sorry.
thank
you
for
your
time.
