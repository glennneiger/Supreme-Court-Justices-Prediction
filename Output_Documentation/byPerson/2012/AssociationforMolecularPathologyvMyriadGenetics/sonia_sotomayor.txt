justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
why
their
test
wasn't
given
a
patent?
i
know
the
method
of
extraction
wasn't,
and
why.
why
would
the
tests
--
would
the
tests
be
subject
to
a
patent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
--
then
explain
when
you
said
you
can't
narrow.
you
said
earlier
you
can't
narrow.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right,
that
individual
claim
is
invalid.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
patent
with
respect
to
claims
that
are
not
invalid
would
still
stand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
primers
and
probes
stand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
whole
point,
isn't
it?
the
isolation
itself
is
not
valuable;
it's
the
use
you
put
the
isolation
to.
that's
the
answer,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so,
that
is
the
answer,
which
is
in
isolation
it
has
no
value.
it's
just
nature
sitting
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a
failure
of
the
patent
law.
it
doesn't
patent
ideas.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
go
to
--
can
we
go
to
cdna
a
moment?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
artificially
created
in
the
laboratory,
so
it's
not
bound
in
nature.
it's
not
taking
a
gene
and
snipping
something
that's
in
nature.
and
yet
you
claim
that
can't
be
patented.
the
introns
are
taken
out,
the
exons
are
left
in,
and
they're
sequenced
together.
give
me
your
brief
argument
on
that.
i
read
your
brief,
but
it
is
not
a
product
of
nature;
it's
a
product
of
human
invention.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
goes
to
obviousness.
that
does
not
in
my
mind
go
to
the
issue
of
whether
it's
patent
eligible.
you
may
have
a
very
strong
argument
on
obviousness,
but
why
does
it
not
--
it's
creating
something
that's
not
found
in
nature
at
all.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
a
separate
question--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--about
whether
this
claim
is
too
expansive
because
it's
claiming
every
15
nucleotides
and
nature
produces
15
randomly.
but
assuming
the
claim
was
for
the
entire
mutated
gene
and
not
the
small
snippet
that
they
want
to
capture
the
whole
gene
with,
that's
--
that
whole
gene
without
the
introns
is
just
not
found
in
nature.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
we
fighting
over
nothing?
are
you
fighting
over
nothing?
if
--
if
they
can
patent
this
cdna
in
the
way
they
have,
what
does
it
matter,
since
it
appears
as
if
research
has
to
rely
on
the
cdna
to
be
effective?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understand--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
understand
why
you
are
saying
cdna
is
patentable
as
a
subject
matter.
i
am
looking
at
the
way
the
claim
is
phrased,
however,
and
it
says
that
it's
patenting
a
dna
segment
15
nucleotides
long
or
longer.
the
reality
is
that
15
nucleotides
doesn't
necessarily
bridge
a
sequence
that
goes
between
exons.
it
--
it
can
--
one
exon
can
be
15
or
more
sequences
long.
so
are
you
arguing
that
this
claim
as
written
is
sustainable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
not
taking
the
position
that
this
claim
as
written
is
patentable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
as
i
understand
it,
15
nucleotides
long
exists
naturally
in
nature.
they
get
reproduced
in
that
sequence
of
15.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
on
the
basis
of
a
new
extraction
process?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
have
a
sort
of
analytical
problem.
i
find
it
very,
very
difficult
to
conceive
how
you
can
patent
a
sequential
numbering
system
by
nature,
in
the
same
way
that
i
have
a
problem
in
thinking
that
someone
could
get
a
patent
on
the
computer
binary
code
merely
because
they
throw
a
certain
number
of
things
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
certain
order.
i
always
thought
that
to
have
a
patent
you
had
to
take
something
and
add
to
what
nature
does.
so
how
do
you
add
to
nature
when
all
you
are
doing
is
copying
its
sequence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
add
to
it
besides
process
or
use?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
look,
i
can
bake--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
can
bake
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
using
natural
ingredients
--
salt,
flour,
eggs,
butter
--
and
i
create
my
chocolate
chip
cookie.
and
if
i
combust
those
in
some
new
way,
i
can
get
a
patent
on
that.
but
i
can't
imagine
getting
a
patent
simply
on
the
basic
items
of
salt,
flour
and
eggs,
simply
because
i've
created
a
new
use
or
a
new
product
from
those
ingredients.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
explain
to
me--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--why
gene
sequences,
whether
in
the
actual
numbers,
why
gene
sequences
are
not
those
basic
products
that
you
can't
patent.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
cdna.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i
put
salt
and
flour,
and
that's
different?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
i
take
them
apart,
now
you
can
get
a
patent
on
the
salt
and
now
you
can
get
a
patent
on
the
flour?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
guess--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
you're
not
suggesting
if
you
cut
off
a
piece
of
the
liver
or
a
piece
of
the
kidney
that
that
somehow
makes
that
piece
patentable.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
the
difference?
i
mean,
if
you
cut
off
a
piece
of
the
whole
in
the
kidney
or
liver,
you're
saying
that's
not
patentable,
but
you
take
a
gene
and
snip
off
a
piece,
that
is?
what's
the
difference
between
the
two--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
there
some
value
to
us
striking
down
isolated
dna
and
upholding
the
cdna?
if
we
were
to
do
what
the
government
is
proposing
in
this
case,
what's
the
consequences?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
how
do
you
understand
judge
bryson's
dissent
with
respect
to
cdna?
i
think
he's
saying
that
a
gene
created
from
--
into
cdna
as
a
whole
is
okay,
but
that
he
had
a
problem
with
the
description
of
that
claim
because
it
included
15
nucleotide
long
segments
or
fragments
which
he
says
reoccur
in
nature.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
i'm
making
your
job
harder.
how
could
they
write
it
to
do
what
he
thinks
would
be
patentable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
assuming
we
believe
that
there
is
some
human
invention
in
this
process;
whether
it's
obvious
or
not,
separate
question.
but
he's
not
creating
--
the
cdna
is
not
in
nature
naturally.
so
make
that
assumption.
make
the
assumption
that
they
can
make
a
claim
for
it.
how
do
we
avoid
his
problem?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know
you
are
helping
your
adversary
by
answering
this
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
am
putting
that
aside.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
only
if
they
do
a
recombinant
dna,
that's
what
you
are
saying.
