justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hansen,
could
you
tell
me
what
you
think
the
incentives
are
for
a
company
to
do
what
myriad
did?
if
you
assume
that
it
takes
a
lot
of
work
and
takes
a
lot
of
investment
to
identify
this
gene,
but
the
gene
is
not
changed
in
composition,
and
what
you
just
said
is
that
discovering
uses
for
that
gene
would
not
be
patentable
even
if
those
new
--
even
if
those
uses
are
new,
what
does
myriad
get
out
of
this
deal?
why
shouldn't
we
worry
that
myriad
or
companies
like
it
will
just
say,
well,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
do
this
work
anymore?
justice
elena
kagan
i
thought
you
were
going
to--
justice
elena
kagan
--i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
something
else,
mr.
hansen,
and
i
guess
i
--
i
hoped
you
were
going
to
say
something
else,
which
is
that,
notwithstanding
that
you
can't
get
a
patent
on
this
gene,
that
--
that
there
are
still,
you
know,
various
things
that
you
could
get
a
patent
on
that
would
make
this
kind
of
investment
worthwhile
in
the
usual
case.
but
if
that's
the
case,
i
want
to
know
what
those
things
are
rather
than
you're
just
saying,
you
know,
we're
supposed
to
leave
it
to
scientists
who
want
nobel
prizes.
and
i
agree
that
there
are
those
scientists,
but
there
are
also,
you
know,
companies
that
do
investments
in
these
kinds
of
things
that
you
hope
won't
just
shut
them
down.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
hansen
--
mr.
hansen
just
said
that
to
do
recombinant
technology,
you
have
to
use
the
cdna
rather
than
the
native
d
--
the
isolated
dna.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
elena
kagan
general
verrilli,
could
i
understand
what
you
said,
because
i
think
it
might
be
a
little
bit
different
from
mr.
hansen
and
i
just
want
to
understand
your
position.
you
said
that
a
company
can't
get
a
--
a
patent
on
the
thing,
but
can
get
it
on
the
uses.
so,
if
i
find
this
plant,
let's
say,
in
the
amazon
and
i
can't
get
a
patent
on
the
thing
itself,
but
can
i
get
a
patent
when
i
discover
that
if
you
eat
this
plant
it
has
therapeutic
effects?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
castanias,
go
back
to
justice
alito's
plant
in
the
amazon,
right,
because
it
takes
a
lot
of
ingenuity
and
a
lot
of
effort
to
actually
find
that
plant,
just
as
it
takes
a
lot
of
effort
and
a
lot
of
ingenuity
to
figure
out
where
to
snip
on
--
on
the
genetic
material.
but
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
you
could
patent
that
plant
because
it
takes
a
lot
of
effort
and
a
lot
of
ingenuity
to
find
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
can
you
patent
the
thing
itself?
justice
elena
kagan
even
though
you
know
you
have
to
extract
the
plant
itself--
justice
elena
kagan
--from
the
amazon
forest.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
not
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
manipulation
means.
i
mean,
you
have
to
take
the
plant
and
uproot
it,
all
right?
justice
elena
kagan
and
carry
it
away
and
isolate
it.
can
you
now
patent
the
thing
itself?
you've
now
taken
it
out
of
the
amazon
forest.
can
you
now
patent
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
the
plant
in
the
forest
can't
be
used
for
any
purpose
either.
it
only
has
a
use
when
it's
taken
out
--
you
know,
when
it's
uprooted
and
taken
out
of
the
forest.
but
it's
still
the
same
thing.
and
i
guess
what
you
haven't
gotten
me
to
understand
is
how
this
is
different
than
that.
it's
still
the
same
thing,
but
now
that
you've
isolated
it,
it
in
fact
has
lots
of
great
uses.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
castanias,
could
i
take
you
away
from
the
deference
point
and
just
ask
again
about
the
--
the
kind
of
law
that
you
would
have
us
make.
do
you
think
that
the
first
person
who
isolated
chromosomes
could
have
gotten
a
patent
on
that?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
justice
elena
kagan
right.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
first--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry,
because
--
because
--
because,
like
justice
breyer,
i
consider
uses
--
patents
on
uses
in
a
different
category.
so
i'm
just
asking,
could
you
patent
the
isolated
chromosome?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
chromosomes
are
very
useful.
justice
elena
kagan
the
first
person
who
found
a
chromosome
and
isolated
it,
i
think
we
can
all
say
that
that
was
a
very
useful
discovery.
and
the
question
is,
can
you
then
--
can
the
person
who
found
that
chromosome
and
isolated
it
from
the
body,
could
they
have
gone
to
the
pto?
justice
elena
kagan
and
the
pto
seems
very
patent
happy,
so
could,
you
know,
would
--
would
they
have
had
a
good
patentability
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
of
course
it
does.
justice
elena
kagan
would
--
would
--
okay.
justice
elena
kagan
and
that's
interesting--
justice
elena
kagan
--because
then
it's
not
a
question
about,
you
know,
breaking
these
covalent
bonds
or
whatever
judge
lourie
thought
it
was
about.
right?
so,
you
know,
if
--
if
not
dna,
if
--
if
not
the
--
the
more
smaller
unit
in
the
chromosome,
you
know,
we
could
just
go
up
from
there
and
talk
about
all
kinds
of
parts
of
the
human
body,
couldn't
we?
couldn't
we
get
to,
you
know,
the
first
person
who
found
a
liver?
