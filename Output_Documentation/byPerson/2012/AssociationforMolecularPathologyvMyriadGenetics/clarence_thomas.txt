this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
each
human
gene
is
encoded
with
dna,
or
as
dna
which
takes
the
shape
of
a
double
helix.
dna
is
used
to
create
strings
of
amino
acids
that
build
proteins
in
the
body.
scientists
can
extract
dna
from
cells
and
isolate
specific
segments.
they
can
also
synthetically
creates
strands
of
dna
containing
only
the
portions
of
dna
that
are
actually
used
to
create
strings
of
amino
acids.
these
synthetic
dna
molecules
are
known
as
complimentary
dna
or
cdna.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
dna
and
cdna
are
eligible
for
patent
protection.
respondent
myriad
genetics,
found
the
precise
sequence
and
location
of
the
human
genome
of
two
genes
or
on
the
human
genome
of
two
genes
called
brca1
and
brca2.
mutations
in
these
genes
are
dramatic
or
can
dramatically
increase
the
risk
of
breast
and
ovarian
cancers
developing.
this
knowledge
enabled
myriad
to
develop
medical
test
useful
for
detecting
mutations
in
those
genes
and
is
thereby
assessing
a
patient's
risk
of
developing
cancer.
once
it
found
these
genes
myriad
sought
and
obtained
several
patents.
these
patents
gave
myriad
the
exclusive
right
to
isolate
an
individual's
brca1
and
brca2
genes
and
the
exclusive
right
to
synthetically
create
cdna
based
on
these
genes.
petitioners
filed
a
lawsuit
seeking
a
declaration
that
myriad's
patents
are
invalid.
the
district
court
agreed
and
invalidated
myriad's
patents,
but
the
federal
circuit
reversed,
finding
both
isolated
dna
and
cdna
patent
eligible.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
section
101
of
the
patent
act
states
“that
who
ever
invents
or
discovers
any
new
and
useful
composition
of
matter
may
obtain
a
patent”
subject
to
other
requirement
is
not
an
issue
here.
in
interpreting
this
language
we
have
long
held
that
so
called
“products
of
nature
are
not
patentable
because
something
that
already
exists
in
nature
is
a
not
a
new
invention.
but
we
have
also
recognized
that
the
rule
against
patents
on
naturally
occurring
things
does
have
limits,
because
at
some
level
everything
comes
from
nature.
patent
protection
strikes
a
delicate
balance
between
creating
incentives
that
lead
to
creation,
invention
and
discovery
on
the
one
hand
and
impeding
flow
of
information
that
might
permit
and
spur
invention
on
the
other.
applying
these
principles
we
must
determine
whether
myriad's
patents
claim
a
new
and
useful
composition
of
matter
or
instead
claim
naturally
occurring
phenomena.
myriad's
dna
claim
falls
within
the
products
of
nature
exception
and
are
not
eligible
for
patent
protection.
myriad's
principal
contribution
was
uncovering
the
precise
location
and
sequence
of
brca1
and
brca2
genes.
myriad
did
not
create
or
altered
the
genetic
information
encoded
in
the
two
genes
or
the
genetic
structure
of
the
dna
itself.
it
identified
important
and
useful
genes
but
this
discovery,
ground
breaking
as
it
was,
does
not
by
itself
satisfy
the
section
101
inquiry.
we,
therefore,
conclude
that
nearly
finding
the
location
of
the
brca
1
and
brca2
genes
does
not
render
the
genes
patent
eligible,
new
compositions
of
matter
under
section
101.
myriad's
claims
are
not
saved
by
the
fact
that
isolating
dna
from
the
human
genome
severs
the
chemical
bonds
that
bind
gene
molecules
together.
the
claims
are
not
expressed
in
terms
of
chemical
composition
nor
do
they
rely
on
the
chemical
changes
resulting
from
the
isolation
of
a
particular
dna
section.
consequently
myriad's
patent
on
brca
gene
--
on
the
brca
gene,
are
invalid.
we
reach
different
conclusion
how
ever
with
respect
to
cdna.
in
our
view,
cdna
is
not
a
product
of
nature
and
is
therefore
patent
eligible
under
section
101.
in
order
to
create
cdna,
portions
of
natural
dna
must
be
eliminated
from
the
naturally
occurring
gene.
the
result
is
a
molecule
that
contains
only
the
portions
of
the
dna
sequence
that
create
proteins.
because
cdna
is
not
naturally
occurring
but
is
instead
the
product
of
human
ingenuity,
we
conclude
that
cdna
is
distinguishable
from
not
patentable
products
of
nature.
for
these
reasons
and
others
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
federal
circuit
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
