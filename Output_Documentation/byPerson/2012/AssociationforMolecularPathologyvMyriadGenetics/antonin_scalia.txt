well,
i'm
curious
as
to
why
the
methodology
of
extracting
the
gene
has
not
been
patented.
you
say
everybody
--
everybody
uses
it.
why
wasn't
that
patented?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
still
haven't
answered
her
question.
why?
why
would
a
company
incur
massive
investment
if
it
--
if
it
cannot
patent?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
still
not
answering
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
curiosity
is
your
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
but,
of
course,
to
profit
from
--
from
that
recombinant
dna,
you
have
to
not
just
isolate
the
gene,
but
then
you
have
to
do
something
with
it
afterwards.
so
you
really
haven't
given
us
a
reason
why
somebody
would
try
to
isolate
the
gene.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
sure,
yes,
i
can
do
stuff
with
it
afterwards,
but
so
can
everybody
else.
what
advantage
do
i
get
from
being
the
person
that
or
the
company
that
isolated
that
--
that
gene.
you
say
none
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
lovely.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
--
you've
really
lost
me
when
you
say
that
it's
nature
that
does
the
alteration
rather
than
the
scientist.
i
mean,
whenever
a
scientist
does
an
alteration,
he
does
it,
you
know,
by
some
force
of
nature.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
he
doesn't
do
it
unnaturally,
does
he?
i
mean,
there's
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
well,
well,
well,
this
is
something
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
i
--
i
assume
that
it's
true
that
--
that
those
abridged
genes,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
do
exist
in
the
body.
that
they
do
exist.
you
--
you
haven't
created
a
type
of
gene
that
does
--
does
not
exist
in
the
body
naturally.
