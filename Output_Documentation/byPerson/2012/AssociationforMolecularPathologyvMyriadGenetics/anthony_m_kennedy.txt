from
what
you
know
and
from
what
the
record
shows,
would
the
process
of
tagging
the
isolated
dna
be
patentable?
the
process
of
tagging,
we
just
don't
know
about
that
or
is
there
a
patent
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
our
--
our
law,
is
a
patent
ever
divisible
so
that
if
it's
valid
in
part
but
invalid
in
another
part,
it
can
still
stand
as
to
the
part?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
haven't
challenged
this,
then
--
then
where
are
we
with
respect
to
the
tagging?
i
don't
quite
understand.
because
the
--
the
entire
patent
which
includes
tagging
would
fail
under
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
the
court
can
decide
the
case
on
--
on
that
basis.
i'm
sure
that
there
are
substantial
arguments
in
the
amicus
brief
that
this
investment
is
necessary
and
that
--
and
that
makes
sense.
to
say,
oh,
well,
the
taxpayers
will
do
it,
don't
worry,
is
i
think
an
insufficient
answer.
as
justice
kagan's
follow-up
questions
indicated,
i
thought
you
might
say,
well,
there
are
process
patents
that
they
can
have,
that
this
is
sufficient.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
--
i
just
don't
think
we
can
decide
the
case
on
the
ground,
oh,
don't
worry
about
investment,
it'll
come.
i
--
i
just
don't
think
we
can
do
that.
it
may
be
that
the
law
allows
you
to
prevail
on
the
fact
that
this
is
--
occurs
in
nature
and
there's
nothing
new
here,
but
that's
quite
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
i
first
looked
at
this
case,
i
--
i
thought
that
maybe
the
cdna
was
kind
of
an
economy
class
gene,
was
--
it
wasn't.
but
my
understanding
is
that
it
may
have
a
functionality
that
the
--
the
dna
isolate
does
not,
easier
to
tag,
et
cetera.
that
may
be
incorrect
for
the
record,
but
that
was
my
present
understanding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
all
the
tagging
done
on
recombinant
dna?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
his
understanding
is
correct.
suppose
your
misunderstanding
--
suppose
your
understanding
is
not
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
when
you
--
when
you
isolate
the
dna,
that
by
itself
cannot
be
used
as
--
as
a
probe
until
you
add
tags
and
--
and
other
chemicals
that
make
it
a
probe.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
seemed
to
me
your
--
your
answer
was
not
quite
accurate
when
you
said,
well,
it
can't
be
used
in
the
body
to
detect
breast
cancer.
neither
can
the
isolate
without
some
additions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
if
it's
--
if
it's
the
process
or
the
additions
that
make
it
patentable,
fine.
but
you're
say
that
the
moment
it's
snipped,
it's
patentable,
and
that
it
seems
to
me
was
--
was
the
point
of
justice
kagan's
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
could
have
said
that
with
atomic
energy,
with
electric,
but
so
far
the
choice
--
electricity
--
but
so
far
the
choice
of
the
patent
was
that
we
have
a
uniform
rule
for
all
industries.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
that
avoids
giving
special
industries
special
subsidies,
which
is
very
important
it
seems
to
me.
let
me
ask
you
this,
and
it's
consistent
with
my
--
my
preface.
if
we
were
to
accept
the
government's
position
that
the
dna
is
not
patentable
but
the
cdna
is,
would
that
give
the
industry
sufficient
protection
for
innovation
and
research?
and
if
not,
why
not?
