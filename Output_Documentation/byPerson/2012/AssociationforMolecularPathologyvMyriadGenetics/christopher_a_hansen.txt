mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
way
to
address
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
what
exactly
did
myriad
invent?
and
the
answer
is
nothing.
myriad
unlocked
the
secrets
of
two
human
genes.
these
are
genes
that
correlate
with
an
increased
risk
of
breast
or
ovarian
cancer.
but
the
genes
themselves,
their
--
where
they
start
and
stop,
what
they
do,
what
they
are
made
of,
and
what
happens
when
they
go
wrong
are
all
decisions
that
were
made
by
nature,
not
by
myriad.
now,
myriad
deserves
credit
for
having
unlocked
these
secrets.
myriad
does
not
deserve
a
patent
for
it.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
in
--
in
essence,
your
honor,
everything
starts
with
a
natural
product.
and
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
just
extracting
a
natural
product
is
insufficient.
for
example,
this
court
has
used
the
example
of
gold.
you
can't
patent
gold
because
it's
a
natural
product.
the
examples
that
you
cite
all
involve
further
manipulation
of
a
product
of
nature,
so
that
the
product
of
nature
is
no
longer
what
it
was
in
nature;
it's
become
something
different,
and
in
many
instances
has
taken
on
a
new
function.
but--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--of
course.
i
think
that
is
totally
acceptable.
and
what's
interesting
in
this
case
is,
the
process
that
myriad
uses
to
extract
the
genes
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
it's
a
process
that's
used
by
geneticists
every
day
all
over
this
country.
it
is
routine,
conventional
science.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
the
--
the
process
by
which
it's
extracted
is
now
very
routine.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
think
they
have
to
find
a
different
way
of
extracting
it,
in
the
same
way
that
finding
a
method
of
extracting
gold
does
entitle
you
to
a
patent
on
the
method
of
extracting
gold,
it
may
also
entitle
you
to
a
patent
on
the
use
of
gold.
for
example,
if
you
find
a
new
way
of
using
gold
to
make
earrings,
or
if
you
find
a
new
way
of
using
dna
to
do
something,
you
may
be
entitled
to
a
patent
on
that,
because--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--the
tests
are
also
routine
and
conventional
science,
but
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
some
method
claims
that
we
challenged.
the
method
claims
in
this
case
involved
taking
the
genes
that
you
extracted
from
the
woman
and
the
gene
that
you
--
the
way
you
think
it
should
be,
and
simply
looking
back
and
forth
to
see
if
they're
the
same
or
different.
and
the
federal
circuit
that
--
found
that
that
was
an
abstract
idea,
and
not
patentable.
and,
in
fact,
that's--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--the
original
--
the
original
methodology
was
patented,
and
is
--
is
patentable.
in
fact,
if
they
came
up
with
a
new
process,
it
would
be
patentable.
but
it
has
--
but
that
--
it
has
been
very
freely
licensed.
in
fact,
the
patent
may
now
have
expired.
and
so
it's
used
all
over
the
country
every
day.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
if
there
is
no
alteration,
if
we
simply
pick
the
leaf
off
of
the
tree
and
swallow
it
and
it
has
some
additional
value,
then
i
think
it
is
not
patentable.
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
method
patent
on
it,
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
use
patent
on
it,
but
you
can't
get
a
composition
patent.
but
as--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--no,
that
may
well
be
eligible,
because
you
have
now
taken
what
was
in
nature
and
you've
transformed
it
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
you've
made
it
substantially
more
concentrated
than
it
was
in
nature;
and
second,
you've
given
it
a
function.
if
it
doesn't
work
in
the
diluted
form
but
does
work
in
a
concentrated
form,
you've
given
it
a
new
function.
and
the
--
by
both
changing
its
nature
and
by
giving
it
a
new
function,
you
may
well
have
patent--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--well,
i
don't
think
it
has
a
new
function,
your
honor,
with
respect.
i
believe
that
what
--
myriad
has
proffered
essentially
three
functions
for
the
dna
outside
the
body
as
opposed
to
inside
the
body.
the
first
is
we
can
look
at
it.
and
that's
true,
but
that's
not
really
a
new
function.
that's
simply
the
nature
of
when
you
extract
something
you
can
look
at
it
better.
the
second
two
rationales
that
myriad
has
proffered
are
that
it
can
be
used
as
probes
and
primers.
three
of
the
--
three
of
lower
court
judges
found
that
full-length
dna,
which
all
of
these
patent
claims
include,
cannot
be
used
as
probes
and
primers.
but
more
important,
finding
a
new
use
for
a
product
of
nature,
if
you
don't
change
the
product
of
nature,
is
not
patentable.
if
i
find
a
new
way
of
taking
gold
and
making
earrings
out
of
it,
that
doesn't
entitle
me
to
a
patent
on
gold.
if
i
find
a
new
way
of
using
lead,
it
doesn't
entitle
me
to
a
new
--
to
a
patent
on
lead.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
the
very
patents
in
this
case
include
claims
on
--
on
dna
that
is
tagged
so
that
it
can
be
used
as
a
probe.
we
have
not
challenged
that.
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
strike
down
that.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
no,
it
is
not
permissible
under
patent
law
to
do
essentially
a
narrowing
--
narrowing
construction
of
the
--
of
the
claim.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
oh,
i'm
sorry,
no.
i
misunderstood.
the
claims
that
we
are
challenging
do
not
--
are
not
limited
to
tagging,
are
not
limited
to
use
as
probes.
there
are
other
claims
that
we
are
not
challenging
that
are
limited
to
probes.
those
would
remain,
but
the
--
but
the
claims
that
we're
challenging
would
in
fact
be
struck
down,
because
they're
not
so
limited.
in
fact--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--yes.
if
a
claim
reaches
something
that
is
both
impermissible
and
permissible,
it
--
the
claim
is
invalid,
period.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
that
individual
claim.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
would
--
would
still
remain.
even
if
you
were
to
rule
for
petitioners,
you
would
not
have
to
rule
concerning
the
use
of
dna
as
a
probe
or
a
primer.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
we
know
that
would
not
have
happened
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
we
know
that
there
were
other
labs
looking
for
the
brca
genes
and
they
had
announced
that
they
would
not
patent
them
if
they
were
the
first
to
find
it.
we
also
know
that
prior
to
the
patent
actually
being
issued,
there
were
other
labs
doing
brca
testing
and
myriad
shut
all
that
testing
down.
so
we
know
in
this
particular
case
that
problem
would
not
have
arisen.
but
the
point
of
the
whole
--
the
whole
point
of
the
product
of
nature
doctrine
is
that
when
you
lock
up
a
product
of
nature,
it
prevents
industry
from
innovating
and
--
and
making
new
discoveries.
that's
the
reason
we
have
the
product
of
nature
doctrine,
is
because
there
may
be
a
million
things
you
can
do
with
the
brca
gene,
but
nobody
but
myriad
is
allowed
to
look
at
it
and
that
is
impeding
science
rather
than
advancing
it.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
taxpayers
paid
for
much
of
the
investment
in
myriad's
work,
but--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--but
--
yeah.
but
i
think
scientists
look
for
things
for
a
whole
variety
of
reasons,
sometimes
because
they're
curious
about
the
world
as
a
whole;
sometimes
because--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--sometimes,
because
they
want
a
nobel
prize.
sometimes--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--let
me
give
a
specific
example
that
may
be
helpful
in
doing
a
better
job
of
answering
the
question.
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
amici
has
worried
a
lot
about
whether
a
decision
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
invalidate
recombinant
dna.
recombinant
dna
is
in
fact
what
all
the
major
innovations
in
the
industry
are
doing
these
days.
it's
dna
where
the
scientist
decides
the
sequence
rather
than
nature
deciding
the
sequence.
there
is
nothing
in
our
position
that
would
prevent
recombinant
dna
from
being
patented,
but
there
is
--
it
is
the
cases
that
if
the
patents
are
upheld,
recombinant
dna
is
frustrated.
people
can't
use
pieces
of
the
brca
gene
to
recombine
them
and
find
new
treatments
and
find
new
diagnoses
and
find
new
things
that
will
advance
medicine
and
science
as
a
result
of
these
patents.
it's
a
perfect
example
of
what
the
point
of
the
product
of
nature
doctrine
is.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--no,
i
think
you
get
enormous
recognition,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--but
i
think
that
we
know
that
that's
sufficient.
we
know
it's
sufficient
with
respect
to
these
two
genes.
we
also
know
it's
sufficient
with
respect
to
the
human
genome.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
and
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
and
it
is
certainly
true,
as
your
honor
suggests,
that
one
of
the
incentives
here
is
a
process
patent
or
a
development
patent.
if
you
--
if
you've
isolated
the
gene
and
you
find
a
new
use
for
it,
you
could
get
a
patent
on
the
new
use
for
the
patent.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
that's
exactly
correct.
thank
you.
yes,
that
is
the
answer.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
interestingly,
it
has
one
value.
and
that
is
you
can
look
at
it
to
see
if
there's
a
mutation
in
it.
and
when
you
find
a
mutation
in
the
isolated
gene,
you
write
back
to
the
woman
who
provided
the
sample
and
you
say
to
her:
because
the
isolated
gene
is
the
same
as
the
gene
in
your
body,
i
can
tell
you
that
there's
a
mutation
in
your
body.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
and
it
shouldn't
patent
ideas,
and
--
but
it
also
makes
the
point
that
isolated
gene
and
the
gene
in
the
body
are
the
same.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
sure.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
there
are
two
big
differences
between
cdna
and
dna.
the
first
is
exactly
the
one
your
honor
just
discussed,
which
is
that
the
introns,
the
noncoding
regions,
have
been
removed.
that
is
done
in
the
body,
by
the
body.
that's
done
in
the
process
of
dna
going
to
mrna.
what
the
scientist
does
who's
creating
the
cdna
is
they
take
the
mrna
out
of
the
body
and
then
they
simply
have
the
natural
nature-driven
nucleotide
binding
processes
complement
the
mrna.
so
that
if
the
mrna
has
a
c,
the
scientist
just
puts
the
corresponding
nucleotide
in
there
and
nature
causes
them
to
bind
up.
the
scientist
does
not
decide--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--yes.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
yes.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
but
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
question
is
not
whether
it
is
identical
to
something
in
nature.
the
question
is
whether
there
was
a
human
invention
involved,
whether
it
is
markedly
different
from
what
is
found
in
nature.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
the
sequence
of
the
nucleotides
is
dictated
by
nature.
the
order
that
they
go
in
is
dictated
by
nature.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
it
is
true--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--it
is
not
--
the
--
the
exons
with
the
exact
same
composition
and
in
the
exact
same
order
are
found
in
nature,
and
the
question
is
whether
when
the
body
removes
the
introns,
has
the
body
made
something
markedly
different
than
what
is
in
nature,
and
it
is
our
view--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--it
is
somewhat
easier
to
work
with
cdna
to
make
recombinant
dna,
and
it's
recombinant
dna
that
is
the
place
where
all
of
the
innovation
and
all
the
efforts
are
taking
place.
and
if
we
lock--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--all
of
the
change
--
all
of
the
useful
things
that
we
are
inventing
is
done
--
is
done
through
the
process
of
recombinant
dna.
and
if
we
lock
up
the
cdna,
it
makes
it
harder
to
do
the
recombinant
dna.
so
that
if
someone
owns
all
the
cdna,
i
can't
do
recombinant
dna
using
what
the
company
owns.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
it
certainly
--
there's
--
there
is
some
manipulation,
although
it's
--
it's
letting
nature
manipulate,
not
doing
--
not
the
scientist
manipulating.
but
it
--
what
the
other
factor
that
distinguishes
aspirin
and
the
other
examples
you
use
from
cdna
is
that
they
have
--
the
alteration
of
the
substance
has
also
altered
the
function,
and
cdna
has
exactly
the
same
function
as
dna
with
the
exception
of
justice
kennedy's,
that
it's
easier
to
use
with.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
no--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--well,
let
me
try
an
analogy,
your
honor,
that
might
be
helpful.
in
our
view,
it's
like
funk
brothers
in
the
sense
that
the
five
bacteria
in
funk
brothers
didn't
sit
together
in
nature.
the
scientists
took
them
and
put
them
together
in
nature.
here
the
scientist
takes
the
exons
and
lets
the
natural
processes
of
the
body
put
them
together
in
--
in
the
laboratory.
it's
exactly
the
same
as
funk
brothers.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
sure,
of
course.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
no--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
there--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--well,
that
certainly--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--yes.
the
other
support
for
it
is
the
definition
of
the
dna
in
the
patent
itself,
which
we
cite,
which
says
that
whenever
we
use
the
term
“
dna
”
we
mean
both.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
of
--
of
course
there
would
be
value
in
that
in
the
sense
that
--
that,
a,
it
reinforces
the
product
of
nature
doctrine,
but
more
importantly,
the
effect
of
the
patents
in
this
case
allows
myriad
to
stop
all
research
on
a
part
of
the
human
body.
if
you
uphold
the
patents
in
this
case,
myriad
can
--
has
the
authority
given
it
by
the
government
to
stop
anyone
from
doing
research
on
a
piece
of
the
human
body.
that
would
be
a
significant
advance,
if
you
were
to
--
to
make
it
clear
that
was
impermissible.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
and
yes,
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
he
was
focusing
on
claims
5
and
6,
which
are
the
ones
that
include
15
nucleotides
or
--
or
longer.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
all--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--well--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--that's
fine,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
--
all
of
the
claims
in
this
case,
all
nine
claims
that
we
are
challenging
include
both
fragments
and
the
whole
gene.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
you
can
do
with
respect
to
these
nine
claims.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
i
think
by
saying
that
when
genes
are
transformed
in
such
a
way
that
the
scientist
decides
their
sequence
rather
than
the
nature
deciding
their
sequence--
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
--right,
right.
now
i
don't
think
cdna
is
recombinant
dna,
that's
what
we've
argued,
but
that's
--
that's
at
least
one
plausible
way
of
looking
at
it.
the
genes
in
this
case,
the
patents
on
the
genes
in
this
case
cover
the
genes
of
every
man,
woman,
and
child
in
the
united
states.
and
as
i
just
said,
it
gives
the
--
the
government
has
given
myriad
the
authority
to
stop
research
on
every
one
of
our
genes.
that
simply
can't
be
right.
and
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
point
with
respect
to
dr.
lander's
brief.
on
page
16
of
dr.
lander's
brief
he
discusses
specifically
that
the
brca
genes
appear
in
the
body
with
covalent
bonds
in
fragments.
there
isn't
any
real
--
there
isn't
any
scientific
dispute
about
that
fact.
mr.
christopher
a.
hansen
well,
i
guess
the
only
other
thing
i
would
say,
your
honor,
is
to
respond
to
what
i
may
have
left
a
misimpression
with
justice
kagan's
questions.
we
agree
that
you
could
get
a
patent
on
a
use
of
the
leaf
that
is
pulled
out
of
the
amazon
or
a
plant
that
is
pulled
out
of
the
amazon.
we
don't
dispute
that.
we
don't
think
you
cannot
get
a
patent
on
the
plant
itself
just
because
you
pulled
it
out
of
the
ground
and
took
it
to
the
united
states.
