mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
now
33
years
after
chakrabarty,
31
years
after
the
first
isolated
gene
molecule
patents
issued,
and
12
years
after
the
patent
and
trademark
office
issued
its
carefully
reasoned
utility
guidelines
confirming
that
new
isolated
gene
molecules
are
eligible
for
patents,
and
it's
almost
16
years
after
myriad's
patents
began
to
issue,
patents
which
--
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
on
a
--
a
new
extraction
process,
no.
most
of
the
processes
are
known.
but
that's
not
relevant
to
patent
eligibility
or,
for
that
matter,
patentability.
as
the
last
sentence,
justice
sotomayor,
of
section
103a
says,
"patentability
shall
not
be
negated
by
the
manner
in
which
the
invention
was
created.
"
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
i
guess
i'll--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--sure.
well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
guess
i'll
take
issue
with
the
notion
that
there
is
nothing
additive
here.
what
myriad
inventors
created
in
this
circumstance
was
a
new
molecule
that
had
never
before
been
known
to
the
world.
now
remember,
genes
are
themselves
human
constructs.
and
this
points
up
some
of
the
serious
analytical
problems
with
the
product
of
nature
doctrine
as
the
line-drawing
exercise
that
you've
asked
general
verrilli
and
mr.
hansen
to
engage
in
has
illustrated.
now,
the
line-drawing
is
what
is
the
product
of
nature
to
start
with?
is
it
me?
is
it
the
genome?
is
it
the
chromosome?
is
it
the
--
and
the
gene
ultimately--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--is
what
was
defined.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
and
that's--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--sure.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
okay.
i'll
start
by
--
by
showing
you
how
this
is
actually
a
different
structure.
it
actually
has
an
entirely
different
chemical
name
when
you
give
it
the
c--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--no,
no,
no.
that's
absolutely
true
with
regard
to
the
isolated
molecule
as
well.
because
if
you
were
to
write
it
out
in
those
--
those
interminable
chemical
equations
that
we
had
to
do
in
high
school,
it's
a
“
c
”
very
different,
“
h
”
very
different.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
that
is
--
that
is
the
combination,
yes,
of
two
different
things,
and
that's
sort
of
like
--
that's
sort
of
like--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--well,
they
were
apart
before,
but
they
were
both
old.
but
that's
the
problem
with
using
the
really
simplistic
analogies,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
about
you
know,
like
coal--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--like
leaves
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
yes,
thank
you,
justice
alito.
it
--
it's
got
5,914
nucleotides.
the
genome
itself
has
over
3
billion.
it's
arranged
in
the
way
set
forth
--
as
set
forth
in
the
seq
ids
number
1
and
2.
number
2
is
the
so-called
genomic
dna,
seq
id
number
1
is
the,
as
justice
breyer
understood,
the
cdna
molecule.
when
you
look
at
those
particular
sequences,
there
was
invention
in
the
decision
of
where
to
begin
the
gene
and
where
to
end
the
gene.
that
was
not
given
by
nature.
in
fact--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--but
we've
--
i'll
--
i'll
use
my
own
simplistic
analogy
which
we
offered
in
our
brief
and
which
we
offered
to
the
lower
court.
a
baseball
bat
doesn't
exist
until
it's
isolated
from
a
tree.
but
that's
still
the
product
of
human
invention
to
decide
where
to
begin
the
bat
and
where
to
end
the
bat.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
i
will
tell
you
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--well,
no,
i
think
--
i
think
you
may
have
read
some
of
the
submissions
correctly,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that's
a
question--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--i
think
that's
a
question
of
some
dispute
in
this
record.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
what
i
will
tell
you--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--what
i
will
tell
you
is
that
what
are
called
pseudogenes--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--yes.
so
the
answer
--
i
would
say
the
answer
is
no,
because
there
is
no
evidence--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--i
do
disagree
with
it
with
the
following--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--as
a
matter
of
science
with
the
following
--
okay.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
you
want
me
to
tell
you
something
from
a
scientist
that
you
should
read
that
tells
you
that
it
is
wrong?
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
i
think
you
could
look
at
the
declaration
in
the
--
the
joint
appendix
for
dr.
kay,
for
example.
dr.
kay's
declaration
appears
at
--
starting
at
page
370.
you'll
find
an
extensive
discussion
in
there
of
the
technology
here
and
--
and
of
the
genetics.
but,
justice
breyer,
just
to
explain
the
finishing
thought,
what
--
what
dr.
lander
says
in
his
brief
is
that
these
pseudogenes,
which
are
un
--
undifferentiated
fragments,
exist
in
the
body.
what
hasn't
been
brought
to
the
--
to
the
forefront
is
something
that
is
new
and
useful
and
available
to
the
public
for
--
for
allowing
women
to
determine
whether
they
have
breast
or
ovarian--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--mutations
that
are
likely
to
result
in
cancer.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
sure.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
i
--
i
guess
i'll
even
take
issue
with
that,
because
the
--
the
story
of
how
the
seq
id
number
2,
the
genomic
dna
segment
came
about
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
that.
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
page
488
of
the
joint
appendix,
that's
the
declaration
of
one
of
the
inventors,
donna
shaddick,
at
paragraph
27,
what
--
what
she
explains
is
that
the
myriad
inventors
first
created
the
cdna,
which
we
agree
at
least
on
that
score
with
the
solicitor
general,
is
indeed
eligible
for
patenting.
but
then
--
and
by
the
way,
that
cdna
was
created
from
hundreds
of
different
patient
samples
to
create
what
was
called
a
consensus
sequence.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
and
then
what
the
--
what
the
myriad
inventors
then
did
to
create
what
is
called
seq
id
number
2
and
what
is
claimed
in
claim
1
of
the
'282
patent
is
to
take
--
actually
manipulate
that
further
to
add
in
the
introns.
it
was
in
--
actually,
the
inventive
process
was
additive.
now,
ultimately,
again,
going
back
to
the
last
sentence
of
section
103,
the
patentability
should
not
be
negative
--
or
negated
by
the
manner
in
which
an
invention
was
made,
maybe
that
shouldn't
matter.
but
it
is
a--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--well,
first
of
all,
you
wouldn't
even
know
where
to
snip
until
the
myriad
invention.
that's
the
first
problem.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
right.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
and
--
and
that
is
indeed
a
product
of
human
ingenuity
and
that
has
substantial
new
uses.
now,
my
friends
on
the
other
side
have
said--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--the
plant
itself,
i
think
not,
justice
kagan,
but
i
think
the
question
that
was
--
that
was
posed
was
whether
i
could
take
an
extract
from
that
plant.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
the
thing
itself
i
would
--
in
that
hypothetical,
i
would
say
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
it's
a
lot
of--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--ah,
but
you
see,
now
you're
adding
the
manipulation--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--okay.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
what
i
--
what
i
haven't
done
is
isolated
a
new
thing.
all
i
have
done
is
isolate
the
plant
from
the
forest.
and
that's
the
distinction
i
think
i'm
trying
to
get
across
to
the
court,
not
particularly
well
at
least
in
my
colloquy
with
justice
breyer,
but
i'll
try
again.
and
that
is
that
what
--
what
was,
quote,
merely
snipped
out
of
the
body
here
is
fundamentally
different
in
kind
from
what
was
in
--
what
is
in
the
body.
the
most
important
reason
it's
different
in
kind
is
that
it
cannot
be
used
in
the
body
to
detect
the
risk
of
breast
and
ovarian
cancers.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
i
think
there
are
two
ways
--
two
ways
to
look
at
that.
first
of
all,
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
from
the
--
the
perspective
of
the
so-called
product
of
nature
doctrine,
which
i
think
has
some
very
dangerous
consequences
if
it's
not
cabined
and
understood
correctly
--
but
if
you
look
at
it
strictly
from
a
product
of
nature
doctrine,
you
could
say,
well,
that's
the
same
plant
and
it
says
in
the
1930
legislative
history
of
the
plant
patent
act
that
plants
that
are
unmanipulated
by
the
hand
of
man
are
not
eligible
for
patents,
and
that's
fine,
in
terms
of
their
breeding
and
genetics
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
the
product
of
nature
doctrine
is
troublesome
for
this
reason:
modern
medicine
--
go
beyond
just
the
isolated
dna
patents
here.
modern
medicine,
particularly
the
area
of
personalized
medicine,
is
trying
to
get
to
a
point
where
what
we
are
administering
to
individual
patients
is
giving
them
the
opportunity
to
mimic
the
actions
of
the
body.
and
--
so
actually,
the
goal
of
medicine
is
to
get
closer
to
nature,
rather
than
farther
away.
and
anything
that
takes
the
product
of
nature
doctrine
beyond
the
simple
truism
that
the
product
of
nature
is
something
that
is
not
a
human
invention,
then
that's
very
dangerous,
not
just
for
our
case--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--as
a
probe,
that's
true.
as
a
primer,
that
wouldn't
be
required.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
since
this
court
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
i
--
i
will
say
that
that
is
the
final
inventive
act.
it's
not
the
only
inventive
act.
it's
the
final
inventive
act.
if
--
if
indeed
you
were
creating
it--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
no,
what
--
i
think
justice
--
judge
lourie
was
exactly
correct
to
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
says
that
isolated
dna
fragments
of
brca1
exist
in
the
body.
neither
does
dr.
lander's
brief,
for
that
matter.
and
for
that
matter,
those
isolated
fragments
that
are
discussed
in
dr.
lander's
brief
again
are
--
are
what
are
known
not
--
not
in
any
way
as
isolated
dna,
but
as
pseudogenes.
they're
typically
things
that
have
been
killed
off
or
mutated
by
a
virus,
but
they
do
not--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--that's
pretty
much
the
same
as
what
he's
talking
about,
is
that
there
might
be
something
that
was
out
there
somewhere.
but
--
but
that's
really
--
the
search
for
this
sort
of
thing
that
might
be
very
similar
to
the
thing
but
never
was
known
before.
the
patent
law
has
taught
--
the
patent
law
is
all
about
pushing
the
frontiers.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--i
--
i
will
offer
the
view,
justice
breyer:
first
of
all,
in
this
court's
decision
in
brenner
v.
manson,
followed
repeatedly
by
the
federal
circuit,
it
has
been
hornbook
patent
law,
to
use
your
term,
that
you
do
not
need
to
--
to
call
out
the
utility
of
an
invention
in
a
particular
claim.
what
you
do
have
to
do
is
have
utility
for
the
invention
itself
described
in
the
specification.
and
that's
what
the
patent
office
looked
to
in
its
utility
guidelines
in
2001.
but
ultimately,
neither
--
i
think
this
case
is
very
--
very
easily
decided
on
a
straightforward
ground
that
does
not
require
the
court
to
go
making
fine
distinctions
between
cdna
and
dna.
and
that
ground
is
this:
the
reasoned
utility
guidelines
issued
in
2001
by
the
patent
office,
who
has
not,
in
a
very
significant
decision,
joined
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case
--
and
which
they
continue
to
apply
under
section
2107
of
the
manual
of
patent
examining
procedure,
these
guidelines
not
only
tell
examiners
what
to
do,
but
in
the
federal
register
they
had
notice
and
comment
and
23
specific
reasoned,
supported
by
case
law,
supported
by
science,
responses
to
the
objectors.
almost
every
objection
that
is
made
to
our
patents
here
was
made
there
and
answered
there.
the
pto
issued
those
guidelines
to
the
public.
they
have
been
relied
on
now
for
12
years,
and
they
confirm
a
practice
that
has
been
in
place
much
longer
than
that.
and
if
you
take
--
whether
you
can
call
it
the
skidmore
deference
or
just
giving
respect
to
the
agency
that
sits
at
the
intersection
of
law
and
science
--
justice
breyer,
as
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
dickinson
v.
zurko
pointed
out
--
those
--
that
decision
by
the
patent
office
is
entitled
to
respect,
the
reliance
that
has
been
placed--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--even
so,
and
--
and
the
reason
for
that
is--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--i
think
you
can
dilute
it
a
little
bit,
but
you
can't
take
away
the
fact
that
it
is
a
30-plus
year
practice
that
the
patent
office,
despite
the
executive's
position
in
this
court
and
in
the
federal
circuit,
continues
to
follow.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
i
think
in
theory
that
is
possible,
but
i
should
say
this:
because
this
case
is
about
section
101,
i'm
trying
--
i'm
answering
your
question
as
though
it's
about
101,
patent
eligibility.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
would
it
be
obvious,
would
it
be
novel?
i'm
not
sure.
those
are
different
--
those
are
different
analytical
structures.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
but
would
it
--
and
i
think
really,
the
--
the
statute
does
the
work
here.
it
is
new
and
useful
composition
of
matter--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--if
it
had
use.
if
it
had
a
new
utility,
then
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
again,
i
--
i
perhaps
am
not
making
myself
as
clear
as
i
should.
in
section
101,
a
patent
claim
must
be
shown
to
be
useful;
and
that
--
that
is
a
utility
that
it
has
to
be
shown--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--in
any
case.
[laughter]
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
if
they
--
if--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--i
think
if
--
to
get
through
the
section
101
gateway,
if
that
chromosome
had
a
specific
substantial
and
credible
utility,
in
other
words,
it
could
be
used
in
some--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--diagnostic
way
in
the
way
that
we're
talking
about
here,
then
yes,
it
would
pass
through
the
section
101
gate.
whether
it
would
pass
through
the
section
102
gate
or
the
103
gate,
i
don't
have
any
opinion
on.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
and
then
there's
the
further--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--sure.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
i
--
i
think
--
i
think,
justice
kagan,
you're
really
putting
your
finger
on
the
problem
with
this,
again,
i
--
i
keep
wanting
to
refer
to
as
the
so-called
product
of
nature
doctrine
because
i
don't
believe
that
as
a
separate
doctrine
it
really
exists.
it's
just
the
flip
side
of
the
coin
of
something
that
shows
a
lack
of
invention.
and,
of
course,
that's
where
section
103
comes
into
full
force
as
the
chief
justice
mentioned
earlier
in
the
argument.
section
103
allows
you
to
make
comparisons
to
what
was
old
and
what
was
new.
i
don't
think
the
organ,
the
liver,
gets
past
103
in
that
circumstance
even
if
you
say,
well--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--even
if
it
gets
through
the
101--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--no.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
okay.
so
let
--
let
me
try
to
help
you
with
that.
because
--
because
the
distinction
is
between
the
liver
or
the
kidney,
which
was
the
one
brought
up
in
the
federal
circuit
opinion,
but
liver,
kidney,
you
know,
gallbladder,
pick
your
organ.
but
it's
the
same
thing.
it
is
the
same
thing
when
it's
inside
the
body
and
it's
out.
that's
where
our--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--no.
absolutely
not.
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
under
--
under
your
existing
decisions
in
chakrabarty,
j.e.m.,
that
set
forth
a
broad
understanding
of
section
101
and
an
understanding
of
what
is
within
the
limited
exception,
then
what
--
i
--
i
would
--
i
mean,
honestly,
i
think
that
section
103
does
this
work
better
than
section
101,
but
to
the
point
of
section
101,
there's
--
there
is
nothing
different
about
that
piece
in
the
body.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
and
i
think,
justice
breyer,
there
is
where
i've
--
i've
tried
to
explain
to
you
about
the
different
functions,
the
different
values.
if
you
think
about
patents
as
economic
instruments,
the
different
economic
values
that
come
out
of
this,
the
different
things
that
patients
now
have
as
a
result
of
this
human
ingenuity,
they
didn't
have
the
brca1
isolated
gene
before
the
myriad
invention.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
right,
but
in--
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
--the
--
the
problem
of
making
that
decision
now
is
that
so
much
has
happened
since
these
gene
patents
issued
and
since
the
utility
guidelines.
i
can't
tell
you
for
a
certainty
whether
it
will
hurt
the
industry
as
a
general
matter
to
not
have
isolated
gene
but
only
have
cdna
patents.
but
here's
what
i
think
it
will
hurt,
and
i
think
it
ultimately
will
hurt
the
doctrine
that
this
court
comes
out
of
this
case
with.
because
what
you
will
then
be
asking
litigants
to
do
and
courts
to
do
is
to
draw
fine
distinctions
under
section
101
between,
well,
how
much
more
manipulation.
my
friend
on
the
other
side
used
the
term,
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg,
"further
manipulation
is
required
to
take
it
out
of
the
product
of
nature.
"
he
--
he
said
no
alteration,
to
justice
alito,
would
make
it
a
product
of
nature.
but
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
there
has
been
some
alteration
of
the
isolated
dna
molecules.
and
that
brings
me
back
to
the
utility
guidelines.
this
line
was
drawn.
it
was
drawn
by
an
expert
agency
that
sits
at
the
intersection
of
law
and
science,
and
it
has
said,
without
any
apparent
--
other
than
the
declarations
and
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
put
into
this
case
--
without
any
apparent
effect
on
the
explosion
in
biotechnology
and
the
successful,
economically
successful,
technologically
successful,
and
life-saving
industry
that
is
at
the
heart
of
these
inventions.
that
has
not
--
those
--
that
parade
of
horribles
has
not
happened.
and
you
don't
have
to
hypothesize
at
this
point
because
you've
got
all
of
these
years
of
experience
between
the
time
these
patents
issued
and
the
time
that
this
--
this
challenge
belatedly
came
along.
justice
breyer,
a
point
about
no
impermissible
preemption
before
i
sit
down.
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
mayo
made
that
very
much
an
important
point,
but
i
think
what
you
--
what
is
important
to
understand
here
is
that
these
patent
claims
aren't
for
methods.
they
don't
prevent
--
present
that
problem
that
the
court
identified
in
that
argument
and
in
the
argument
in
bilski.
these
are
for
specific
molecules
that
exist
in
the
physical
world.
that
--
that
concern
that
is
present
with
method
claims
is
not
here,
these
patents
cover
--
these
patent
claims
cover
only
what
is
claimed
and
no
more.
there
is
no
risk
of
a
natural
law
or
a
physical
phenomenon
like
energy
or
electricity,
neither
of
which
falls
within
the
statutory
categories.
there
is
no
risk
of
anything
being
preempted
other
than
what
the
claims
properly
claim,
which
are
human-made
inventions
of
isolated
molecules.
and
i
think
one
last
point
to
close
on.
it's
important
to
note
that
molecules
have
been
patented
for
a
very
long
time.
that's
what
drugs
are.
and
drugs
are
often
made
by
taking
one
molecule
and
another
molecule,
both
of
which
are
known,
reacting
them
in
a
test
tube,
which
is
a
very
common
thing,
reactions
have
been
around
100
years
just
like
snipping
has
been,
but
they
make
something
new
and
useful
and
life
saving
from
that.
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
well,
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
--
the
discussion
we
had
earlier,
the
--
in
--
in
fact,
the
sequence
that's
claimed
in
claim
1
of
the
'282
patent
was
not
created
by
snipping.
if
i
can
just
conclude
with
one
more
sentence?
mr.
gregory
a.
castanias
only
once
it
was
created
can
a
scientist
ever
know
how
and
where
to
make
the
decision
to
snip.
thank
you.
