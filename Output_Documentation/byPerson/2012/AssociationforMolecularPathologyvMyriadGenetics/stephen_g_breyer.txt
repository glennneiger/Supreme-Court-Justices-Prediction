justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
i
don't
see
the
answer,
because
i
gather,
if
i
--
if
i've
read
it
correctly,
that
when
you
have
an
r
--
the
messenger
rna
does
not
have
the
same
base
pairs.
there's
a
u
or
something
instead
of
an
a
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
when
you
actually
look,
if
you
could
get
a
super-microscope
and
look
at
what
they
have
with
the
cdna,
with
their
cdna,
you
would
discover
something
with
an
a,
not
a
u.
is
it
au?
is
that
the
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
--
so
you
would
discover
something
with
an
a
there,
you
see,
and
you
wouldn't
discover
something
with
a
u
there.
and
there
is
no
such
thing
in
nature
as
the
no-introns
agg,
whatever,
okay?
it's
not
there.
that's
not
truly
isolated
dna.
but
you
can
go
look
up
the
amazon,
wherever
you
want.
hence
the
question.
now,
on
that
one,
how?
how
is
that
found
in
nature?
the
answer
is
it
isn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
a
question,
which
i
don't
think
will
be
taken
from
your
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
have
to
ask
you
this.
look,
you
say
don't
reach
the
cdna
issue
and
the
reason
is
because
of
the
nature
of
the
claim.
okay,
i
look
at
their
claim.
their
claim
says
they
want
"the
isolated
dna
of
claim
1
wherein
said
dna
has
the
nucleotide
sequence
set
forth
in
seq
id
no.
1.
"
then
we
turn
to
that
and
the
first
thing
it
says
right
there
is
it
says,
“
the
molecule
involved
is
”
--
“
molecule
type:
cdna
”.
and
then
it
has
a
long
list
and
that
long
list
is
a
list
of
the
basis,
okay.
so
molecule
type,
cdna.
so
they
say
what
do
you
mean
they
aren't
claiming
cdna?
that's
what
they
say
they're
claiming.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
of
the
word
“
wherein
”.
so
i
go
back
to
the
“
wherein
”
in
prometheus
and
the
“
wherein
”
--
you
read
“
wherein
”
as
in
context,
and
in
this
context
you
mean
to
say
that
a
person
who
makes
isolated
dna
that
has
lots
of
introns
in
it
as
well
as
the
sequence
is
going
to
be
an
infringer
under
claim
2?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
support
for
that
other
than
the
treatise
that
you
cited?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
looked
at
that
and
it
said
read
the
“
wherein
”
depending
on
context.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
depending
on
--
okay.
then
you
got
--
you
heard
what
i
said,
so
i
want
to
know
is
there
anything
else
i
should
read?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
saw
that.
i
saw
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
true,
but
then
you
were
saying
something
that
i
just
didn't
understand,
because
i
thought
the
--
the
scientists
who
had
filed
briefs
here,
as
i
read
it,
said
it's
quite
true
that
the
chromosome
has
the
brca
gene
in
the
middle
of
it
and
it's
attached
to
two
ends.
but
also
in
the
body,
perhaps
because
cells
die,
there
is
isolated
dna.
and
that
means
that
the
dna
strand,
the
chromosome
strand
is
cut
when
a
cell
dies,
and
then
isolated
bits
get
around,
and
there
may
be
very
few
of
them
in
the
world,
but
there
are
some,
by
the
laws
of
probability,
that
will
in
fact
match
precisely
the
brca1
gene.
now,
have
i
misread
what
the
scientists
told
us,
or
are
you
saying
that
the
scientists
are
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
probably
misread
it.
there's
a
better
chance
that
i've
misread
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
which
one
have
i
not
read--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
the
lander
brief
is
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know,
because
i
have
to
admit
that
i
read
it
and
i
did
assume
that
as
a
matter
of
science
it
was
correct.
so
i
would
like
to
know
whether
you
agree,
as
a
matter
of
science,
that
it
is
correct,
not
of
law,
but
of
science,
or
if
you
are
disagreeing
with
it,
as
a
matter
of
science.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
like
a
yes
or
no
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
the
answer
no,
you
do
not
disagree
with
it?
i
wonder,
i
disagree
or
i
do
disagree?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
a
matter
of
science.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
very
well.
if
you
are
saying
it
is
wrong,
as
a
matter
of
science,
since
neither
of
us
are
scientists,
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
what
i
should
read
that
will,
from
a
scientist,
tell
me
that
it's
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
need
to
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so,
when
you
are
on
that,
that's
good.
a
more
basic
question
to
me
is
when
you
use
the
word
“
dangerous
”.
i
had
thought
--
and
you
can
--
i'd
be
interested
in
your
view
--
that
the
patent
law
is
filled
with
uneasy
compromises,
because
on
the
one
hand,
we
do
want
people
to
invent;
on
the
other
hand,
we're
very
worried
about
them
tying
up
some
kind
of
whatever
it
is,
particularly
a
thing
that
itself
could
be
used
for
further
advance.
and
so
that
the
compromise
that
has
been
built
historically
into
this
area
is:
of
course,
if
you
get
a
new
satisfying
process
to
extract
the
sap
from
the
plant
in
the
amazon,
patented.
of
course,
if
you
get
the
sap
out
and
you
find
that
you
can
use
it,
you
manipulate
it,
you
use
it,
you
figure
out
a
way
to
use
it
to
treat
cancer,
wonderful,
patented.
but
what
you
can't
patent
is
the
sap
itself.
now,
in
any
individual
case
that
might
be
unfortunate
or
fortunate.
but
consider
it
in
the
mine
run
of
things.
it's
important
to
keep
products
of
nature
free
of
the
restrictions
that
patents
there
are,
so
when
captain
ferno
goes
to
the
amazon
and
discovers
50
new
types
of
plants,
saps
and
medicines,
discovers
them,
although
that
expedition
was
expensive,
although
nobody
had
found
it
before,
he
can't
get
a
patent
on
the
thing
itself.
he
gets
a
patent
on
the
process,
on
the
use
of
the
thing,
but
not
the
thing
itself.
now,
that's
my
understanding
of
what
i'd
call
hornbook
patent
law,
which
you
i
confess
probably
understand
better
than
i.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
would
like
you
to
express
your
view
on
that,
because
that's
the
framework
that
i
am
bringing
to
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
saying
it
gets
past
101.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
--
that's
the
problem.
i
mean,
all
parts
of
the
human
body?
anything
from
inside
the
body
that
you
snip
out
and
isolate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
gets
through
101?
does
it
have
to
--
i
mean,
that's
actually
what's
bothering
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
then
--
then
watch
what
you're
doing.
that's
very,
very
interesting,
because,
really,
we
are
reducing,
then,
101
to
anything
under
the
sun,
and
--
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
we've
rejected
more
often
than
we've
followed
it.
and
particularly
with
a
thing
found
in
nature
doctrine,
because,
of
course,
it
doesn't
just
--
human
kidneys
and
so
forth.
everything
is
inside
something
else.
plants,
rocks,
whatever
you
want.
and
so
everything
will
involve
your
vast
taking
something
out
of
some
other
thing
where
it
is,
if
only
the
environment.
and
it's
at
that
point
that
i
look
for
some
other
test
than
just
that
it
was
found
within
some
other
thing.
