mr.
hansen,
respondents
say
that
isolating
or
extracting
natural
products,
that
has
long
been
considered
patentable,
and
give
--
examples
were
aspirin
and
whooping
cough
vaccine.
how
is
this
different
from
--
those
start
with
natural
--
natural
products.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hansen,
you
answered
my
initial
question
by
saying
they
start
--
everything
starts
with
a
national
--
natural
product,
but
these
others,
the
examples
that
i
gave,
you
said
they
involve
manipulation.
the
--
the
cdna
can't
be
characterized
as
involving
manipulation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mister
--
general
verrilli,
i
got
the
distinct
impression
from
your
brief
that
your
view
was
that,
although
the
cdna
may
be
patentable,
it
might
very
well
be
rejected
as
obvious.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli,
there's
an
assertion
made
in
respondents'
brief
that
the
united
states
would
be
in
a
singular
position.
that
is,
they
suggest
that
in
every
other
industrialized
nation
this
could
be
subject
--
could
be
patentable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
concede--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
concede
at
least
that
the
decision
in
the
federal
circuit,
that
judge
lourie
did
make
an
incorrect
assumption,
or
is
the
lander
brief
inaccurate
with
respect
to
that,
too?
that
is,
judge
lourie
thought
that
isolated
dna
fragments
did
not
exist
in
the
human
body
and
dr.
lander
says
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
though
--
even
though
the
government
has
disavowed
it,
even
though
the
government,
representing
the
united
states--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--at
least
that
the
strength
of
the
presumption
would
be
diluted.
