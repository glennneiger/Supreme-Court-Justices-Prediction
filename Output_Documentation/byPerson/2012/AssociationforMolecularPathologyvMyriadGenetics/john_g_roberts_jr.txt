chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-398,
association
for
molecular
pathology
v.
myriad
genetics,
inc.--
mr.
hansen?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
dispute
that
you
can
patent,
however,
a
process
for
extracting
naturally-occurring
things?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
isn't
that
--
why
isn't
that
a
way
to
in
effect
have
patent
protection
for
the
product?
does
somebody
who
wants
to
use
the
product,
the
dna
--
extracted
dna
in
this
case
have
to
find
a
new
process
from
--
to
extract
it
if
they
want
to
have
it
available?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no
--
yes,
i
know.
i'm
assuming
it
isn't,
that
they
discover
this
process
and
it
leads
to
a
--
a
particular
product.
does
anybody
who
wants
to
use
the
product
either
have
to
get
a
license
for
the
process
or
find
a
different
way
of
extracting
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general
verrilli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
i
--
i
thought
the
basic
general
approach
here
was
we
have
a
very
expansive
view
of
what
is
patent
eligible
and
then
we
narrow
things
through
things
--
issues
like
obviousness
and
so
on.
why
--
wouldn't
it
make
more
sense
to
address
the
questions
at
issue
here
in
the
obviousness
realm?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
got
something
that's
big,
it
seems
to
me
pretty
obvious
that
you
could
take
a
smaller
part
of
it;
that
the
idea
--
a
smaller
part
of
something
that's
bigger
is
obvious.
now,
yes,
you
can
have
a
patent
on
the
process
of
extracting
that
small
part,
but
i
don't
understand
how
a
small
part
of
something
bigger
isn't
obvious.
and
if
it
is,
i
don't
understand
why
this
--
these
issues
aren't
addressed
at
that
stage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that's
responsive
to
my
concern.
your
answer
said
well,
here
are
a
lot
of
reasons
why
this
shouldn't
have
patent
protection.
my
question
goes
to
whether
we
ought
to
focus
on
those
reasons
at
the
eligibility
stage
or
at
the
obviousness
stage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
briefly,
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
castanias?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--can
i
get
back
to
your
baseball
bat
example?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
understanding
--
my
understanding
is
that
here,
what's
involved,
obviously
through
scientific
processes,
but
we're
not
talking
about
process.
here,
what's
involved
is
snipping.
you've
got
the
thing
there
and
you
snip
--
snip
off
the
top
and
you
snip
off
the
bottom
and
there
you've
got
it.
the
baseball
bat
is
quite
different.
you
don't
look
at
a
tree
and
say,
well,
i've
cut
the
branch
here
and
cut
it
here
and
all
of
a
sudden
i've
got
a
baseball
bat.
you
have
to
invent
it,
if
you
will.
you
don't
have
to
invent
the
particular
segment
of
the
--
of
the
strand;
you
just
have
to
cut
it
off.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
you've
got
the
cdna.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
still
don't
understand
what
--
in
what
sense
it's
different
than
just
snipping
along
--
along
the
line.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
that's
a
particular
--
where
you
snip.
we're
talking
about
though
the
patentability
of
what's
left--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--after
you've
snipped
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
how
this
is
at
all
like
that,
because
there
you're
obviously
combining
things
and
getting
something
new.
here
you're
just
snipping,
and
you
don't
have
anything
new,
you
have
something
that
is
a
part
of
something
that
has
existed
previous
to
your
intervention.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
hansen,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
don't
you
take
another
minute.
you
weren't
afforded
an
opportunity
to
use
the
time
you
were
reserved.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12
-398,
the
association
for
molecular
pathology
versus
myriad
genetics.
