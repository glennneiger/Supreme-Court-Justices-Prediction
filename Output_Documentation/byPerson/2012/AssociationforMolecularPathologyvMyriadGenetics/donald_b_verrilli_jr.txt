mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
enforcing
the
distinction
between
human
invention
and
a
product
of
nature
preserves
a
necessary
balance
in
the
patent
system
between
encouraging
individual
inventors
and
keeping
the
basic
building
blocks
of
innovation
free
for
all
to
use.
isolated
dna
falls
on
the
ineligible
side
of
that
divide
because
it
is
simply
native
dna
extracted
from
the
body.
the
claim
that
it
is
a--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
actually
think
that
--
i
think
we're
--
we're
fighting
about
something
of
importance.
that
question
gets
right
to
it.
i
want
to
answer
the
question
directly,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
make
a
prefatory
point
before
doing
so.
the
claim
that
isolated
dna
is
a
human
invention
rests
entirely
on
the
fact
that
it
is
no
longer
connected
at
the
molecular
level
to
what
surrounded
it
in
the
body.
but
allowing
a
patent
on
that
basis
would
effectively
preempt
anyone
else
from
using
the
gene
itself
for
any
medical
or
scientific
purpose.
that
is
not
true
about
a
patent
on
cdna.
a
patent
on
cdna
leaves
the
isolated
dna
available
for
other
scientists
and
other
--
and
others
in
the
medical
profession
to
try
to
generate
new
uses.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
not
my
understanding,
justice
kagan.
my
understanding
is
that
you
--
that
the
native
dna
can
be
used
for
recombinant
dna
without
the
step
of
cdna.
we
do
think
cdna
is
important
and
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
cdna
is
patent
eligible.
we
disagree--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--our
position,
though,
is
that
cdna
is
patent
eligible
because
we
think,
unlike
the
isolated
dna
which
is
just
taken
from
your
body,
cdna
is
an
artificial
creation
in
the
laboratory
that
doesn't
correspond
to
anything
in
your
body.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
true
now,
justice
ginsburg,
but
obviousness
is
determined
at
the
time
that
the
patent
is
issued,
so
what
may
be
true
now
might
not
have
been
true
at
the
time
the
patents
were
initially
issued.
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--that's
a
little--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
my
answer
to
that,
i
guess,
your
honor,
would
--
would
point
first
to
mayo,
in
which
the
court
recognized
that
the
threshold
test
under
section
101
for
patent
eligibility
does
do
work
that
the
obviousness
test
and
a
novelty
test
and
a
specification
test
do
not
do;
and
the
work
that
it
does
here,
i
would
respectfully
submit,
is
to
ensure
that
the
natural
substance,
the
product
of
nature
itself,
is
not
subjected
effectively
to
a
monopoly,
because
if
it
can
be
deemed
to
be
a
human
invention
solely
as
a
result
of
the
change
that
occurs
when
you
extract
it
from
the
body,
then
that
means,
as
a
--
as
a
practical
matter
that
you
have
granted
a
patent
on
the
gene
itself
because
no
one
else
can
extract
it
because
extracting
it
is
isolating
it;
isolating
it
violates
the
patent.
and
so
as
a
result
of
that,
no
one
else
can
try
to
develop
competing
tests
for
breast
cancer,
no
one
else
can
try
to
use
this
gene
for
recombinant
dna.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
the
court
identified
in
chakrabarty
and
then
reiterated
in
mayo
that
--
that
it
is
--
that
the
right
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
is
to
focus
on
them
at
the
eligibility
stage,
because
the
--
because
getting
the
balance
right
is
of
critical
importance.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
i
would
--
again,
i
would
point
the
court
to
what
the
court
said
last
term
in
mayo,
which
is
that
the
determination
of
patent
eligibility
really
is
a
double-edged
sword.
and
it
may
be
that
in
a
--
in
a
particular
case,
maybe
this
case,
although
we
are
not
expressing
a
view
on
it,
you
could
sort
the
issue
out
on
some
of
the
other
criteria,
but
that
won't
generally
be
true,
and
the
proposition
of
whether
you
can
patent
the
gene
itself
is
a
question
we
think
of
fundamental
importance,
and
it
raises
exactly
the
two-edged
sword
concern
that
led
the
court
to
conclude
what
it
did
in
mayo.
and
mayo
was
a
situation
very
much
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
and
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--no.
i
think
the
picture
is
much
more
complicated
than
that.
in
many
other
nations
it
wouldn't
be
patentable
and
the
patent
law
is
different
from
nation
to
nation.
i'll
give
one
example
i
think
helps
illustrate
the
point.
in
germany
and
france,
for
example,
you
can
get
a
patent
on
isolated
genomic
dna
but
only
for
a
particular
use.
so
you
would
get
what
is
the
equivalent
of
a
use
patent,
which
is
a
patent
that
we
would
think
under
our
patent
laws
is
acceptable,
too.
if
you
--
just
as
with
the
question
that
justice
alito
asked
earlier
about
identifying
a
--
a
useful
substance
in
a
plant
in
the
amazon,
if
you
isolate
that
and
it
proves
to
have
therapeutic
effects,
you
can
get
a
patent
on
that
use
of
it,
but
what
you
can't
do
is
get
a
patent
on
the
substance
itself
so
that
no
one
else
can
explore
it
for
different
uses
and
for
--
and
for
different
therapeutic
purposes
or
to
try
to
recombine
it
and
turn
it
into
a
--
an
even
more
therapeutic
--
therapeutically
valuable
substance.
and
that's--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--your
honor,
as
a
--
i
am
going
to
invoke
my
privilege
as
an
amicus
in
this
situation.
i
think
that's
a
fight
between
the
parties.
the
point
that
we
wanted
to
make
is
that
as
a
conceptual
matter
cdna
is
patent
eligible.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
we're
just
saying
as
a
conceptual
matter
that
we
think
cdna
is
a
creation
of
the
lab,
it's
an
artificial
creation;
it's
as
a
general
matter
patent
eligible.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
--
that
may
well
be
right,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
we're
not
taking
a
position
on
the
particulars.
but
if
i
--
just
to
return
to
the
point
that
justice
alito
made,
the
court
really
was
faced
with
a
similar
situation
in
mayo.
on
the
one
side
you
had
the
--
the
industry
coming
in
and
saying:
look,
we
have
got
a
lot
of
reliance
issue,
pto
has
issued
more
than
150,000
patents
here.
you
are
going
to
really
disrupt
those
reliance
issues.
on
the
other
side
you
had
the
american
medical
association,
as
you
have
here,
coming
in
and
saying:
actually,
these
patents
inhibit
much
more
innovation
than
they
incent.
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
--
as
justice
kennedy
alluded
to
earlier,
that
the
court's
not
in
a
position
to
resolve
that
dispute
conclusively.
it
doesn't
have
the
institutional
wherewithal
to
do
it.
but
what
the
court
is
in
a
position
to
do
is
to
apply
the
general
principles
of
law
as
they
were
articulated
in
mayo,
and
then
if
there
needs
to
be
a
particular
different
set
of
rules
for
the
biotech
industry,
congress
can
provide
that
different
set
of
rules.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
may
i
answer
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
you
certainly
can,
and
that
illustrates
the
difference.
that
patent
is
just
for
the
use;
it
doesn't
tie
up
all
other
potential
uses
of
the
substance
and
that's
the
key.
thank
you.
