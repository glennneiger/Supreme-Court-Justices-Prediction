justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
take
you
back
to
--
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
because
i'm
--
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
you
got
at
what
troubles
me
about
that.
suppose
there
is
a
substance,
a
--
a
chemical,
a
molecule
in
the
--
the
leaf
--
the
leaves
of
a
plant
that
grows
in
the
amazon,
and
it's
discovered
that
this
has
tremendous
medicinal
purposes.
let's
say
it
--
it
treats
breast
cancer.
a
new
discovery,
a
new
way
--
a
way
is
found,
previously
unknown,
to
extract
that.
you
make
a
drug
out
of
that.
your
answer
is
that
cannot
be
patent
--
patented;
it's
not
eligible
for
patenting,
because
the
chemical
composition
of
the
--
of
the
drug
is
the
same
as
the
chemical
that
exists
in
the
leaves
of
the
plant.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you're
making
--
you
keep
making
the
hypotheticals
easier
than
they're
intended
to
be.
it's
not
just
the
case
of
taking
the
leaf
off
the
tree
and
chewing
it.
let's
say
if
you
do
that,
you'd
have
to
eat
a
whole
forest
to
get
the
--
the
value
of
this.
but
it's
extracted
and
--
and
reduced
to
a
concentrated
form.
that's
not
patent
--
that's
not
eligible?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
when
you
concede
that,
then
i'm
not
sure
how
you
distinguish
the
isolated
dna
here,
because
it
has
a
different
function.
will
you
dispute
that?
isolated
dna
has
a
very
different
function
from
the
dna
as
it
exists
in
nature.
and
although
the
chemical
composition
may
not
be
different,
it
--
it
certainly
is
in
a
different
form.
so
what
is
the
distinction?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
issue
here
is
a
very
difficult
one.
it's
one
on
which
the
government
has
changed
its
position;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
seems
that
there
is
disagreement
within
the
executive
branch
about
it.
this
case
has
been
structured
in
an
effort
to
get
us
to
decide
this
on
the
broadest
possible
ground,
that
there's
no
argument,
that
it's
just
about
101,
it's
not
about
any
other
provision
of
the
patent
act.
why
--
why
should
we
--
why
should
we
do
that?
we
have
claims
that
if
patent
eligibility
is
denied
here
it
will
prevent
investments
that
are
necessary
for
the
development
of
new
drugs
or
it
will
lead
those
who
develop
the
new
drugs,
new
diagnostic
techniques,
to
keep
those
secret,
not
disclose
them
to
the
public.
why
--
why
should
we
jump
in
and
--
and
decide
the
broadest
possible
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
the
chemical
composition
in
the
isolated
dna
different?
you
were
about
to
explain
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
this
just
a
question
of
probability?
to
get
back
to
your
baseball
bat
example,
which
at
least
i
--
i
can
understand
better
than
perhaps
some
of
this
biochemistry,
i
suppose
that
in,
you
know,
i
don't
know
how
many
millions
of
years
trees
have
been
around,
but
in
all
of
that
time
possibly
someplace
a
branch
has
fallen
off
a
tree
and
it's
fallen
into
the
ocean
and
it's
been
manipulated
by
the
waves,
and
then
something's
been
washed
up
on
the
shore,
and
what
do
you
know,
it's
a
baseball
bat.
is
that--
[laughter]
--is
that
what
dr.
lander
is
talking
about?
