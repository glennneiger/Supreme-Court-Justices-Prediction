justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
may
i
interrupt
a
moment
on--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--following
up
on
an
issue
raised
in
part
by
the
chief
and
by
justice
ginsburg.
assuming
that
davis
was
a
direct
supervisor,
would
there
be
an
affirmative
defense
available
to
the
employer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
would
be
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
this
could
not
be
grounds
that
someone
who
directs
an
employee's
day-to-day
activity
should
be
treated
like
someone
who
hasn't
actually
undertaken
the
threat
because
the
situations
are
different.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
what
this
fight
is
about?
what
if
we
were
to
say
that
the
eeoc's
test
governed
or
the
second
circuit
test
governed,
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
difference
between
formal
supervisors
who
take
tangible
work
activities
and
informal
supervisors
who
the
employer
would
have
less
control
over
and
less
knowledge
about
their
activities,
that
we
would
require
an
employee
to
complain.
would
that
be
a
crazy
rule,
and
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
require,
would
permit
the
affirmative
defense
to
be
raised
by
an
employer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
but
there
is
a
difference
between
those
supervisors
who
take
direct
activity,
tangible
direct
actions,
who
are
in
power
to
do
that,
and
supervisors
who
don't
have
that
power,
because
supervisors
who
don't
have
that
power
are
supervised
--
their
actions
are
supervised
in
a
way
that
non-tangible
employment
supervisors
are
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
it's
whether,
whether
or
not
this
whole
fight
is
over
that
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
because
it's
also
about
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
we
keep
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
employer
raising
the
affirmative
defense,
does
that
solve
half
your
problem?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
tell
me
what
you
see
as
the
major
difference
between
the
eeoc
and
the
second
circuit
rule,
and
why
one
is
compelled
over
the
other?
it's
the
regulatory
agency
charged
with
oversight
of
--
of
the
implementation
of
the
statute.
why
shouldn't
we
give
deference
to
it
on--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
standard
it
sets
forth?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
we
have
a
developed
record
enough
to
do
that
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
--
do
we
have
a
developed
record
enough?
petitioner's
counsel
says
we
don't,
that
the
seventh
circuit
test
didn't
permit
them
to
develop
the
record
sufficiently
to
clarify
all
of
these
issues.
we
certainly
have
snippets
or
--
or
lack
snippets,
as
the
case
may
be.
but
is
the
record
sufficiently
developed
for
the
court
to
even
pronounce
--
make
pronouncements
of
that
nature?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
garre,
there
is
one
bsu
internal
document
that
--
a
note
to
the
file
by
a
compliance
officer,
who
apparently
investigated
one
of
the
complaints,
that
says
that
--
kimes
is
recorded
as
saying
--
he's
the
avowed
supervisor
--
that
he,
quote,
"knows
davis
has
given
direction
to
vance,
and
that
he
just
doesn't
know
what
else
to
do.
"
doesn't
that
defeat
summary
judgment
on
its
face?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
justice
breyer's
question
was
what's
not
in
the
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
something
that's
not
in
the
record
that
will
materially
add
to
this
discourse?
