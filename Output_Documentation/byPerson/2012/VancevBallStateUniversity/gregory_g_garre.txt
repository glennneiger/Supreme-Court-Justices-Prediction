mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
because
the
record
establishes
that
the
only
employees
whose
status
is
at
issue
lacked
the
supervisory
authority
necessary
to
trigger
vicarious
liability
under
title
vii.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
we
don't
think
the
seventh
circuit
test
is
the
complete
answer
to
the
question
of
who
may
qualify
as
a
supervisor.
but
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
--
the
person
whose
status
is
at
issue
did
not
qualify
and
therefore,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
this
court--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
most
importantly,
justice
alito,
because
the
courts
need
guidance
on
how
to
apply
the
eeoc
and
the
second
circuit
standard.
the
best
way
to
provide
that
guidance
is
to
do
what
this
court
often
does,
which
is
to
apply
the
facts
to
the
standard.
in
this
case,
applying
the
record
facts
to
the
standard
that
we
think
applies,
the
“
materially
enables
the
harassment
”
standard,
it's
clear
that
ms.
davis,
the
person
who
is
at
issue,
does
not
qualify
as
a
supervisor.
and
the
reason
why
it's
clear
is
the
record
is
uncontradicted
that
either
the
chef
or
mr.
kimes
made
the
daily
assignments
through
the
prep
sheets.
the
prep
sheets
are
what
every
employee
in
the
kitchen
got
each
day
and
they
would
tell
you:
dice
vegetables
for
60
people;
prepare
boxed
lunches
for
20;
prepare
six
vegetable
trays.
that's
--
that
was
their
daily
assignments,
and
the
record
is
absolutely
clear,
ja
2
--
277,
278,
ja
424
--
that
all
the
employees
got
the
prep
sheets
from
the
chef
or
mr.
kimes.
it's
also
absolutely
clear
that
mr.
kimes
was
the
one
who
controlled
the
schedule
in
the
kitchen.
he
is
the
one
that
told
employees
what
times
of
days
that
they
could
work.
he
controlled
the
schedule.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
there
is
--
there
is
neither
a
material
nor
genuine
dispute
on
that,
your
honor.
it
at
the
very--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but
they
--
they
omit
the
--
the
clause
that
follows,
which
is
critical,
which
is
"via
demonstration,
coaching,
or
overseeing
to
ensure
efficiency.
"
that
is
on
page
joint
appendix
13.
and
that
job
description
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
record
that
makes
crystal
clear
that
it
was
the
chef
who
did
the
daily
assignments
for
the
prep
sheets.
and
there
--
and
there
are
examples
of
the
prep
sheets
as
an
exhibit
to
ms.
fultz's
affidavit,
the
affidavits
at
424
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
--
the
exhibits
are
lll
and
jjj--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
you--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor
has
excellent
briefing
defending
the
seventh
circuit.
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
other
amici
have
defended
it.
we
certainly
think
that
it
--
that
--
that
it's
a
superior--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
a
superior
bright
line,
but,
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
ultimately
this
court's
precedents
compel
that
the
court
reject
that.
and
i
think
most
--
most
squarely
we
look
at
the
faragher
decision.
we
look
at
lifeguard
silverman
in
faragher,
who
had
the
authority
to
control
all
aspects
of
the
victim's
schedule
and
daily
activities
in
a
virtually
unchecked
manner.
so
if
the
court
is
looking
for
an
example
that
it
wants
to
point
to
of
someone
who
could
qualify
under
the
non-seventh
circuit
category,
we
think
that
lifeguard
silverman,
from
this
court's
precedents,
would
be
the
example
that
this
court
would
hold
out.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that
--
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
ginsburg.
and
i
think,
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
justice
kagan
brought
up
in
her
colloquy
with
--
with
mr.
srinivasan,
i
think
the
logic
of
the
court's
precedents,
agency
principles
adopted,
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
someone
who
does
control
virtually
all
aspects
of
one's
schedule
but
yet
lacks
the
authority
to
hire,
fire,
or
demote,
nevertheless
still
would
be
qualified
as
someone
who--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
do
have
great
difficulty,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
if
we
are
wrong
about
what
this
court's
precedents
compel,
then
this
court
should
adopt
the
seventh
circuit
principle,
and
we've
--
we've
said
that
in
our
brief,
if
we're
wrong
in
our
understanding
of
the
court's
precedents.
secondly,
we
think
that
the
--
the
court
can
and
should
establish
meaningful
limits
on
what
this
broader
category
of
supervisors
would
require,
and
i
think
the
case
law
illustrates
that.
if
you
look
at
the
leading
circuits
who
apply
the
standard--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
i
--
i
would
take
issue
with
that.
we
--
we
tried
to
provide
guideposts
that
would
be
helpful.
but
if
you
look
at,
for
example,
the
principle
that
the
eeoc
agrees
with,
which
--
which
is
just
that
limited
or
marginal
occasion
authority
to
lead
or
oversee
by
virtue
of
a
paper
title,
its
grade,
or
seniority
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--what
this
court
said
in
faragher
and
ellerth
--
and
i
appreciate
that
you
dissented
in
the
case,
but
what
this
court
said
was
it
adopted
section
219(2)(d)
of
the
restatement,
second,
of
agency,
the
notion
that
if
--
if
there
was
--
if
the
employee
was
aided
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
harassment
by
virtue
of
an
agency
relation,
that
that
would
be
the
agency
trigger
for
liability.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
rma
then--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
don't
think
it
would,
your
honor,
because
we
agree,
certainly,
with
the
eeoc
that
there
are
material
limits
to
how
far
that
principle
could
be
stretched.
the
court
in
ellerth
made
clear
that
there
were
limits
to
the
vicarious
liability
of
employers
in
this
context.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
for
the
very--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--this
is
the
balance
i
think
that
the
court
struck
in
ellerth,
your
honor,
which
was
--
it
took
into
account
that
the
statute
was
passed
against
the
backdrop
of
agency
principles;
but,
yet,
congress
also
was
cognizant
that
imposing
vicarious
liability
on
the
employer
for
acts
that
the
court
recognized
were
not
themselves
authorized
by
the
employer,
that
that
was
a
punitive
aspect
of
that,
and
the
court
would
establish
limits.
and
i
think
our
position
takes
into
account
that
there
have
to
be
limits
in
this
area,
on
the
extent
of
vicarious
liability,
in
order
to
give
effect
to
congress's
intent;
but,
also
recognizes,
in
the
situation
like
you
had
with
the
lifeguard
in
faragher,
that
that
person
did
have
authority
that
would
assist
in
the
harassment
--
they
made
her
clean
the
toilets,
as
the
lifeguard
in
faragher
said.
and
so
the
court,
i
think,
struck
a
reasonable
balance.
and
taking
the
balance
and
what
this
court
said,
we
think
the
proper
way
to
resolve
this
case
is
to
adopt
something
like
the
eeoc
rule
or
the
second
circuit
rule,
but
to
make
clear
there
are
limits.
and
the
best
way
to
make
clear
that
there
are
limits
is
to
make
clear
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
ms.
davis
did
not
qualify
as
a
supervisor.
now,
my
friend
said
they
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
develop
evidence
to
the
contrary;
but,
the
fact
is,
from
the
outset,
they
litigated
this
case
as
if
the
seventh
circuit
standard
did
not
apply.
the
reasons
that
they
gave
for
why
ms.
davis
was
a
supervisor,
in
the
lower
court,
was
that,
one,
they
pointed
to
the
job
description,
that
she
had
this
other
authority
to
“
lead
and
direct
”,
and
they
also
pointed
to
the
fact
that
she
didn't
clock
in.
those
are
irrelevant
under
the
seventh
circuit
test.
so
all
along,
they
had
in
their
mind
that
they
wanted
to
try
to
show
that
davis
was
different,
and
it
did
have
some
marginal
authority
to
lead--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it's
a
lot
of
guidance,
justice
alito.
i
think
that
the
flip
side
of
that
is
the
court
would
make
clear
that
merely
having
some
occasional
or
marginal
authority
to
lead
or
direct
by
virtue
of
one's
better
paper
title
or
seniority
is
not
sufficient
to
trigger
vicarious
liability.
i
think
that's
going
to
resolve
the
mine-run
of
the
cases
in
which
this
question
has
come
up
and
been
litigated,
at
least
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
if
you
look,
for
example,
at
the
difference
between
something
like
the
mack
case
out
of
the
second
circuit
and
the
mikels
case
out
of
the
fourth
circuit,
in
mikels,
we
had
an
example
of
two
police
officers,
one
had
a
higher
paper
rank,
corporal
versus
private,
and
it
was
alleged
that
the
corporal
was
a
supervisor.
and
the
court
said,
no,
no,
no,
he's
not
a
supervisor,
all
there
is,
is
some
marginal
occasional
authority.
that's
not
sufficient.
it
was
clear
that
the
victim
in
that
case
wasn't
shy
about
telling
the
harasser
where
to
go,
to
tell
him
off.
and
that's
the
kind
of--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--right.
and
we
--
we
don't
think
that
that's
a
dispositive
criterion.
we
recognize
the
point
that
the
person
gets
to
establish
superior
ability
to
stand
up
to
despicable
treatment.
but
i
think
what
our
point
is,
is
that
it's
part
of
the
equation
that
you
would
look
at.
in
essence,
did
the
person
treat
the
alleged
harasser
like
a
co-employee,
or
did
the
person
treat
the
alleged
harasser
like
a
supervisor?
and
in
this
case,
the
record
is
clear
that
she
treated
her
like
a
co-employee,
someone
who
--
they
obviously
had
disagreements
among
them.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
take
this
piece
of
evidence
to
assist
the
court
on
the
question
presented.
i
think
--
but
we
think
what
was
sufficient
to
resolve
the
question
presented
is
the
clear
and
unrefuted
evidence
that
the
prep
sheets,
the
daily
activities
were
assigned
by
the
chef
or
mr.
kimes,
that
mr.
kimes
had
the
authority
to
control
the
schedule.
and
if
you
want
to
go
further
than
that,
the
record
also
shows
that
mr.
kimes
had
the
authority
to
review
--
to
do
annual
reviews.
mr.
kimes
had
the
authority
to
evaluate.
he
had
all
the
kind
of
authority
that
one
would
expect
in
a
supervisor.
so
you
would
ask
the
question,
what's
left?
essentially
nothing.
and
whatever
is
left,
we
agree
with
the
eeoc,
is
not,
as
a
matter
of
law,
sufficient
to
trigger
vicarious
liability.
that
doesn't
mean
she
can't
present
her
claim.
it
--
it
means
that
it's
just
simply
analyzed
under
the
framework
for
co-workers,
in
which
she
bears
the
burden
of
establishing
that
the
employer
was
negligent
in
not
responding
to
it.
and
as
judge
wood,
for
the
court
of
appeals,
and
judge
barker
made
clear
in
their
detailed
opinions,
this
was
not
a
situation
where
the
employer
stuck
its
head
in
the
sand
and
ignored
incidents
of
unpleasantries
or,
in
some
cases,
despicable
racial
epithets--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
it's
a
close
case,
but
my
friend
does,
and
his
amici
do.
and
i
think
the
damaging
signal
that
this
court
would
send
by
remanding
on
this
record
would
be
that,
whatever
it
might
say
in
its
opinion,
that
would
have
virtually
no
force
in
terms
of
establishing
a
standard
that
made
clear
that
this
--
whatever
else
may
be
true
about
what
would
qualify,
something
like
this
does
not
qualify.
and,
again,
like
this
court
did
in
the
global
tech
case,
when
the
court
establishes
a
standard,
oftentimes,
it
applies
the
standard
to
the
facts
and
appreciates
that
that's
the
best
way,
the
most
judicial
way
of
providing
guidance
on
what
that
standard
means.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
if
you
agree
with
our
principle,
that
the
eeoc
also
agrees
with,
that
having
some
limited
or
marginal
authority
to
lead
or
direct
as
a
matter
of
law
is
not
sufficient.
so
that
that
piece
of
evidence,
even
in
its
reasonable
inference,
would
not
be
sufficient
to
create
a
material
issue.
it
also
wouldn't
be
sufficient
creating
--
looking
at
the
body
of
the
evidence,
which
makes
crystal
clear
that
the
prep
sheets
are
really
what
was
driving
the
daily
activities
in
this
workplace.
and
it
was
kimes
or
the
chef
that
did
the
prep
sheets,
not
ms.
davis
at
all.
and
it
--
and
it
was
also
not
material
in
light
of
the
evidence
that
mr.
kimes
did
the
schedule.
ms.
davis
was
asked
at
her
deposition
on
page
135,
quote,
“
was
there
ever
”
--
"have
you
ever
been
assigned
to
a
less
meaningful
or
fulfilling
job
classification?
"
and
her
response
was
yes,
and
she
pointed
to
an
example
by
mr.
kimes,
because
it
was
mr.
kimes
who
had
the
authority
to
make
those
assignments,
not
ms.
davis.
so
the
mere
fact
that
you've
got
some
marginal
evidence
drawn
from
snippets,
giving
it
a
reasonable
inference
that
she
at
times
had
some
ability
to
lead
or
direct,
as
the
job
description
says,
"by
coaching,
demonstration
or
overseeing.
"
is
not
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
law
to
entitle
her
to
summary
judgment,
nor
do
we
think
that
this
court
should
take
the
unusual
step
of
remanding
so
that
she
can
dig
into
events
six
years
old
through
new
discovery.
again--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
first,
i
would
look
at
her
summary
judgment
briefs,
your
honor,
and
in
those
briefs
she
argued
that
davis
was
a
supervisor
because,
one,
under
the
job
description
she
had
the
authority
to
lead
and
direct,
the
same
sorts
of
things
that
we
are
talking
now
and
would
be
talking
about
under
the
eeoc
and
second
circuit
tests.
and,
two,
she
points
to
the
fact
that
they
didn't
clock
in,
again
something
that
is
irrelevant
under
the
seventh
circuit
test.
so
this
wasn't
a
case
where
the
litigant
felt
themselves
bound
by
the
legal
standard
and
one
could
surmise
that
they
would
have
pursued
it
differently.
i
think
i
would
look
at
that
first.
and
then
i
would
look
at
her
deposition
transcript
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
and
the
three
affidavits
that
she
put
in,
in
this
case,
which
are
in
the
joint
appendix.
at
some
point
you
would
expect
her
to
come
along
and
try
to
rebut
the
notion
that
mr.
kimes
and
ms.
fultz
assigned
the
daily
activities
through
the
prep
sheets.
in
fact,
it's
just
the
contrary.
if
anything,
in
her
own
affidavit
she
seems
to
accept
that
the
prep
sheets
were
done
by
kimes
and
the
chef.
that's
at
ja
430.
you
would
expect
her
to
contest
the
notion
that
mr.
kimes
was
the
one
who
did
the
scheduling,
who
did
her
annual
reviews,
who
disciplined
her
on
occasion.
after
all,
she
was
claiming
that
davis
was
the
supervisor,
and
she
didn't
feel
bound
by
the
seventh
circuit
tests.
so
you
would
expect
to
see
some
indication
of
how
ms.
davis
actually
assigned
her
something
to
do,
changed
her
schedule,
the
like.
instead
what
you
find
is
all
those
sorts
of
allegations,
she
made
them,
but
all
those
sorts
of
allegations
were
directed
to
mr.
kimes.
that
was
the
basis
for
her
retaliation
claim,
which
isn't
before
the
court.
but
there
are
all
the
sorts
of
things
that
you
might
expect
one
to
complain
about
against
a
supervisor
in
this
sort
of
vein:
she
made
me
cut
vegetables
instead
of
doing
the
baking
like
i
like
to
do;
she
didn't
assign
me
enough
overtime
so
i
could
make
more
money;
she
changed
my
hours.
those
allegations
were
made.
they
were
directed
at
mr.
kimes
and
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
record
evidence.
there
was
kimes
and
the
chef
who
had
the
authority
to
do
her
daily
activities,
and
kimes
had
the
authority
to
do
the
schedule.
it's
not
enough
for
her
to
come
here
today,
i
don't
think,
and
just
speculate
that
having
an
opportunity
to
go
through
greater
discovery,
which
in
essence
would
amount
to
a
fishing
expedition,
the
court
should
take
the
unusual
step
of
remanding
to
give
her
an
opportunity
for
discovery.
this
court
--
although
we
acknowledge
oftentimes
this
court
does
remand
for
the
lower
courts
to
undertake
that
inquiry,
it
certainly
doesn't
always
do
so.
so
global-tech
is
one
example;
we've
cited
many
more
in
our
briefs.
and
here,
i
think,
again,
the
parties
--
there
is
broad
agreement
on
what
the
standard
should
be.
something
like
the
eeoc
or
second
circuit
test
is,
we
think,
the
best
way
to
frame
it.
but
given
the
debate
among
the
parties
about
what
that
test
means
and
how
it
applies
to
davis
here,
i
think
it's
absolutely
critical
for
the
court
to
apply
the
legal
test
to
the
record
facts
and
hold
that
ms.
davis
is
not
a
supervisor
and
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
although
it's
not
before
this
court,
if
one
wants
to
go
to
the
next
step
and
think
about
the
affirmative
defenses
and
the
like,
this
isn't
a
case
where
the
court
would
be
putting
to
rest
a
valid
title
vii
claim.
but
the
claim
was
extensively
looked
at
below
by
judge
barker
in
the
district
court,
judge
wood
and
her
colleagues
on
the
court
of
appeals,
and
they
found
an
environment
in
which
ball
state
reacted
responsibly
to
the
allegations
that
were
made,
investigated
them
and
took
prompt
action
where
the
investigation
warranted
it,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
most
despicable
things
that
were
uncovered,
racial
epithets
that
were
used
by
another
employee,
ms.
mcvicker,
not
ms.
davis.
the
only
allegations
against
ms.
davis
that
we
think
are
relevant
here
during
the
time
period
that
ms.
davis
was
a
part-time
employee
were:
one,
the
so-called
elevator
incident
where
ms.
davis
allegedly
blocked
ms.
vance
as
she
got
out
of
the
elevator,
which
isn't
race-based
at
all,
we
don't
think;
and
two,
the
alleged
use
of
words
like
“
sambo
”
or
“
buckwheat
”
to
refer--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
we
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
if
you
look
on
page
ja
12,
the
job
description
position
function,
the
last
sentence
says
"requires
leadership
of
up
to
20
part-time
substitute
and
student
employees.
"
so
we
think
it's
clear.
we
said
this
is
in
our
red
brief
and
there
wasn't
any
response
to
it
in
the
yellow
brief,
that
any
authority,
any
conceivable
supervisory
authority,
could
have
only
existed
when
ms.
vance
was
a
part-time
employee.
but
we
don't
think
that
that's
relevant,
your
honor,
because
putting
aside
whether
she
had
authority
over
catering
assistants
who
were
part
time
or
full
time,
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
that
ms.
davis
just
lacked
the
authority
that
would
have
been
sufficient
to
trigger
vicarious
liability.
and
again
we
think
the
paradigm
case
where
that
authority
is
present
is
something
like
the
lifeguard
in
silverman
where
they
control
all
aspects
of
the
daily
activities,
one's
schedule,
one's
daily
work
assignments,
and
down
the
line.
here
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
of
that
authority
that
was
possessed,
and
the
record
makes
clear
beyond
doubt
that
all
that
authority
was
possessed
by
others,
ms.
--
the
chef
and
mr.
kimes.
and
i
think,
as
the
amicus
brief
makes
clear,
this
is
consistent
with
workplaces
across
america
today,
where
jobs
are
less
hierarchical,
more
collaborative,
and
so
where
you
have
got
more
senior
employees
by
virtue
of
their
experience
or
job
title,
just
a
paper
title,
are
in
a
broad
sense
team
leaders
of
the
like
in
the
workplace.
that
doesn't
mean
they
are
supervisors
in
any
traditional
sense,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
mean
they
are
supervisors
for
purposes
of
triggering
vicarious
liability
under
title
vii.
so
for
those
reasons,
we
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below,
to
make
clear
in
order
to
provide
the
needed
guidance
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
assumption
that
something
like
the
eeoc
or
second
circuit
standard
does
apply
to
determine
who
is
a
supervisor
triggering
vicarious
liability.
ms.
davis,
the
only
employee
who
is
at
issue,
does
not
meet
that
standard.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
if
you
have
no
more
questions,
thank
you.
