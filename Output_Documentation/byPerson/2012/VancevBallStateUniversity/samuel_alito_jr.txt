justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
you
point
out
what
the
materially
augments
rule
means?
could
you
provide
a
definition
of
that?
the
authority
to
assign
daily
tasks
has
to
be
sufficient
to
do
what?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
there
are
situations
where
the
assignment
of
responsibilities
is
extremely
unpleasant,
and
so
it's
easy
to
see
how
the
testimony
would
apply
in
that
situation.
but
there
are
also
a
lot
of
situations,
like
the
chief
justice's
example,
where
it's
really
very
unclear.
i
don't
know
how
courts
are
going
to
--
how
courts
can
grapple
with
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
said
that
being
subjected
to
country
music
or
hard
rock
or
wagner,
you
know,
every
single
day
in
the
workplace
would
not
be
sufficient.
i
don't
know.
some
people
might
think
that
it
was
--
that
that
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
the
most
unpleasant
thing
that
davis
could
have
assigned
the
petitioner
to
do?
could
it
be
chopping
onions
all
day,
every
day?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that
would
materially
augment?
chopping
onions
all
day
would
be
enough?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
chopping
--
how
about
chopping
other
things,
just
chopping?
you
are
the
sous-chef,
you
are
going
to
be
chopping
all
day
every
day.
would
that
be
enough?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
isn't
cleaning
the
toilets
a
limited
--
isn't
the
authority
to
decide
who
cleans
the
toilets
the
same
as
the
authority
to
decide
what
the
music
is
going
to
be?
it's
one
thing.
i
thought
--
and
your
answer
on
the
music
was,
well,
that
probably
wouldn't
count
because
it's
the
authority
to
decide
just
one
thing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
argument
is
if
the
only
authority
was
to
decide
who
cleans
the
toilets,
then
--
then
that
would
not
--
that
wouldn't
count,
because
that's
just
one
thing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
can't
possibly
be
what
the
case
means.
suppose
that
it's
--
it's
the
assignment
of
offices,
and
all
of
the
offices
except
one
have
heating
and
air
conditioning,
but
one
has
no
heating
and
no
air
conditioning.
and
so
--
and
that's
the
only
authority
that
this
person
has
is
to
assign
desks.
that
person
says,
if
you
don't
do
whatever
it
is
that
i
want
you
to
do,
i'm
putting
you
in
the
office
where
there's
no
heating,
and
there's
no
air
conditioning.
and
you
would
say
that
doesn't
count
because
it's
just
one
thing.
it's
not
a
broad
range
of
authorities
--
of
authorities.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
conclusion
in
your
brief
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
and
now
--
now
you
are
telling
us
that
we
should
--
we
should
basically
write
an
opinion
on
summary
judgment.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
we
took
this
case
to
decide
whether
the
faragher
and
ellerth
--
and
ellerth
supervisory
liability
rule
is
limited
to
those
harassers
who
have
the
power
to
hire,
fire,
demote,
promote,
transfer,
or
discipline
their
victim.
and
your
answer
to
that
is
no;
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
well,
if
we
--
if
we
agree
with
that
without
having
any
party
defending
the
rule
that
was
adopted
by
three
circuits,
then
surely
--
well,
then,
why
shouldn't
we
just
remand
this
case
for
the
lower
courts
to
decide
this,
this
summary
judgment
issue,
and
--
and
permit
further
development
of
the
record
if
the
record
isn't
fully
developed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
understand
mr.
ortiz
to
say
that
there's
at
least
a
dispute
of
fact
about
whether
davis
could
have
controlled
what
petitioner
did
on
a
daily
basis.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
doesn't
her
job
description
say
that
she
can
assign
tasks
in
the
kitchen?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
guidance
would
your
--
what
guidance
would
the
kind
of
opinion
that
you're
suggesting
we
write
really
provide?
the
--
the
guidance
would
be
that
if
someone
has
no
authority
to
assign
daily
work,
then
that
person
isn't
--
and
also
has
no
authority
to
hire,
fire,
promote,
et
cetera,
then
that
person
isn't
a
supervisor.
how
much
guidance
is
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
you
were
willing
to
concede
that
this
would
be
a
close
case
under
the
second
circuit
standard
or
under
the
eeoc
guidance,
then
there
might
be
an
argument
in
favor
of
our
applying
those
tests
--
or
one
of
those
tests
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
because
then
that
might
provide
some
guidance,
even
though
we
are
supposed
to
be
a
court
of
review,
not
a
court
of
first
view.
but
you're
saying
this
is
an
extremely
weak
case
under
those
standards;
and,
therefore,
what
is
--
what
benefit
is
there
in
our
applying
this?
just
send
it
back
and
have
it
done
in
the
normal
course
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
by
the
district
court.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
requires
us
to
explain
what
we
meant
into
1998
decisions
concerning
employer
liability
for
workplace
harassment
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
in
those
two
cases,
burlington
industries
versus
ellerth
and
faragher
versus
boca
raton,
the
court
held
that
somewhat
different
rules
applied
depending
on
whether
the
employee
accused
of
harassment
is
a
supervisor
or
simply
a
co-worker.
this
difference
comes
into
play
in
those
cases
in
which
no
tangible
employment
action
such
as
termination
or
denial
of
promotion
took
place.
in
these
cases,
if
the
alleged
harasser
was
merely
a
co-worker,
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
employer
was
negligent
in
allowing
the
harassment
to
occur.
but
if
the
alleged
harasser
was
a
supervisor,
the
employer
must
show
that
it
exercised
reasonable
care
and
that
the
plaintiff
unreasonably
failed
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
to
prevent
or
stop
the
harassment.
while
ellerth
and
faragher
established
a
special
rule
for
cases
involving
harassment
by
a
supervisor,
they
did
not
define
what
they
meant
by
the
term
“supervisor”
and
that
is
the
question
that
we
answer
in
this
case.
the
lower
courts
have
grappled
with
this
question
for
some
time
and
two
competing
definitions
have
emerged.
this
case
is
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
under
the
definition
adopted
by
that
court
and
some
others,
a
supervisor
is
a
person
who
has
the
authority
to
take
a
tangible
employment
action,
the
term
i
used
later
--
i
used
earlier,
to
hire,
fire,
promote,
or
take
some
other
action
having
economic
consequences.
under
the
alternative
interpretation
which
is
favored
by
the
eeoc,
supervisor
status
depends
on
a
weighing
of
a
number
of
factors,
several
of
which
are
quite
vague.
according
to
that
alternative,
a
supervisor
must
have
sufficient
authority
over
the
victim,
must
exercise
that
authority
more
than
occasionally,
and
must
do
so
with
respect
to
more
than
a
limited
number
of
tasks.
all
of
these
key
terms
are
hard
to
pin
down.
petitioner
in
this
case
was
employed
in
ball
state
university's
banquet
and
catering
division.
she
sued
ball
state
alleging
that
a
fellow
employee,
davis,
harassed
her
because
of
her
race.
she
claims
that
davis
“gave
her
a
hard
time
by
doing
such
things
as
glaring
at
her,
slamming
pots
and
pants
around
her,
giving
her
weird
looks,
and
blocking
the
entrance
to
an
elevator.”
the
district
court
held
that
ball
state
was
not
vicariously
liable
because
the
alleged
harasser,
who
could
not
take
tangible
employment
actions
against
vance,
was
not
a
supervisor.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
and
we
now
hold
that
the
seventh
circuit
applied
the
correct
definition
of
a
supervisor.
ellerth
and
faragher
adapted
a
framework
that
draws
a
sharp
line
between
supervisors
and
co-workers,
and
the
seventh
circuit's
clear
definition
of
a
supervisor
fits
best
within
this
highly
structured
framework.
perhaps,
the
greatest
advantage
of
this
approach
is
that
it
permits
harassment
cases
to
be
litigated
in
an
orderly
and
understandable
way,
and
this
serves
the
best
interest
of
all
concerned.
under
our
approach,
the
status
of
an
alleged
harasser
will
often
be
obvious
before
the
litigation
even
begins,
and
it
is
likely
to
be
resolved
as
a
matter
of
law
before
trial.
this
permits
the
parties
to
formulate
a
single
coherent
theory
to
be
presented
to
the
jury
and
it
simplifies
the
task
of
juries
which
are
already
required
to
grapple
with
complex,
instructions,
and
employment
discrimination
cases.
a
jury
that
understands
the
law
that
it
has
to
apply
is
more
likely
to
return
a
fair
verdict.
by
contrast,
the
alternative
definition
of
a
supervisor
is
a
study
in
ambiguity.
and
as
a
result
of
this
ambiguity,
the
status
of
an
alleged
harasser
would
often
remain
unresolved
throughout
the
trial.
the
parties
would
have
to
present
their
cases
under
two
separate
legal
frameworks
and
the
job
of
the
jury
would
be
greatly
complicated.
contrary
to
the
dissent,
the
approach
that
we
adopt
will
not
thwart
recovery
for
workplace
harassment.
two
major
points
should
be
kept
in
mind:
first,
regardless
of
whether
an
alleged
harasser
is
classified
as
a
supervisor
or
a
co-worker,
a
harassment
victim
may
always
recover
by
proving
that
the
employer
was
negligent
in
allowing
the
harassment
to
occur.
there
is
nothing
unusual
or
particularly
onerous
about
this
requirement.it
is
very
common
in
the
law
of
torts.
and
the
different
between
or
the
plaintiff
must
show
in
a
co-worker
case,
as
opposed
to
a
supervisor
case,
should
not
be
exaggerated.
perhaps,
the
biggest
difference
is
the
party
who
wins
if
the
jury
thinks
that
the
evidence
favoring
the
plaintiff
and
the
evidence
favoring
the
defense
are
exactly
equal.
in
all
other
cases
where
the
evidence
taps
--
tips
even
slightly
in
one
direction
or
the
other,
the
allocation
of
the
burden
of
persuasion
makes
no
difference.
second,
the
rule
that
we
adopt
today
is
neither
new,
nor
untested.
the
dissenting
opinion
recounts
the
allegations
or
evidence
of
harassment
in
a
number
of
shocking
cases
and
intimates
that
our
holding
would
thwart
recovery
in
such
cases,
but
that
charges
is
unfounded.
the
rule
that
we
adopt
has
been
the
law
for
some
time
in
the
first,
seventh,
and
eight
circuits
which
together
cover
fourteen
jurisdictions:
massachusetts,
new
hampshire,
maine,
rhode
island,
illinois,
puerto
rico,
indiana,
wisconsin,
minnesota,
and
north
and
south
dakota
and
nebraska,
arkansas
and
iowa.
we
are
aware
of
no
evidence
that
this
rule
has
left
harassment
victims
unprotected
in
say,
boston
or
chicago
or
minneapolis.
for
these
reasons,
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
breyer,
justice
sotomayor,
and
justice
kagan
have
joined.
