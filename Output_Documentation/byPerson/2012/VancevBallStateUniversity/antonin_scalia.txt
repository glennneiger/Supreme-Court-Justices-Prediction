justice
antonin
scalia
hard
rock
instead
of--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
why
--
why
--
why
no
more?
why
just
skidmore?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
an
absolute
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
take
this
case
to
--
to
decide
those
factual
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
really
didn't.
we
took
it
principally
to
decide
whether
the
seventh
circuit
rule
was
--
was
right
or
not.
and
you
don't
even
defend
that.
so
there
is
nobody
here
defending
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
not
talking
to
us
here,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
agency?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
why
--
why
do
any
of
these
tests
have
to
do
with
agency?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand
congress
writing
a
statute
that
says,
you
know,
any
--
any
person
given
--
given
authority
by
the
employer,
which
authority
is
used
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
a
person
to
complain
about
racial
or
sexual
harassment,
is
bad.
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
apply
agency
principles.
how
does
agency
have
anything
to
do
with
the
line
you're
arguing
that
we
take
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
why
not
leave
it
there?
if
that's
what
the
agency
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
you
don't
need
it
at
all.
so
the
music
--
the
music
would
--
the
thermostat
would
qualify.
it
would
all
qualify.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
mean,
if
that's
your
principle,
apply
the
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
are
aided,
you
know,
you're
going
to
work
in
a
cold
room
unless
you,
you
know,
comply
with
my
sexual
advances,
apply
the
principle.
what's
so
hard
about
that?
that's
a
clear
line.
