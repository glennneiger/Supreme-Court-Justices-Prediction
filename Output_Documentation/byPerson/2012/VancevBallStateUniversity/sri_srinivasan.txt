mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
person
controls
a
subordinate's
daily
work
activities
and
subjects
her
to
harassment,
that
person
qualifies
as
a
supervisor
for
purposes
of
the
faragher-ellerth
vicarious
liability
affirmative
defense
framework.
when
it
controls
daily
work
activities
and,
therefore,
for
example,
can
compel
the
cleaning
of
toilets
for
a
year,
the
principle
that
the
agency
relationship
augments
the
ability
to
carry
out
the
harassment
is
implicated
in
that
the
victim
will
lack
the
same
ability
to
resist
the
harassment
or
to
report
it
as
would
be
the
case
if
the
harassment
were
conducted
by
a
coworker
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
think
it
comes
out,
most
likely,
against
concluding
that
the
person
is
a
supervisor.
and
the
reason
is
that,
under
the
eeoc
enforcement
guidance,
that
accounts
for
situations
in
which
the
authority
is
exercised
over
a
limited
field,
a
limited
number
of
tasks
or
assignments.
and
this
is
at
page
92(a)
of
the
petition
appendix.
and
i
think
that
would
qualify
under
that
provision
because
it's
limited.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
could,
your
honor.
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
and
i
don't
disagree
that
there
are
going
to
be
cases
that
raise
issues
at
the
margins.
but
one
way
to
think
about
the
spectrum
of
options
available
to
the
court
today
is
to
envision
that
on
one
end,
you
have
harassment
that's
perpetrated
by
a
coworker,
and
you
consider
the
types
of
harassment
that
that
might
entail.
and
on
the
other
end,
you
have
harassment
that's
perpetrated
by
a
supervisor
with
authority
over
tangible
employment
actions.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well
--
well,
i
guess,
your
honor,
as
your
honor
put
it
to
--
to
petitioner's
counsel,
the
competing
approach
would
be
the
approach
adopted
by
the
seventh
circuit;
but,
that
approach
has
some
serious
flaws.
for
example,
it
wouldn't
cover
the
supervisor's
conduct
that
was
at
issue
in
faragher
itself,
where
the
supervisor
threatened
that
he
would
make
the
harassment
victim
clean
the
toilets
for
a
year
if
she
didn't
succumb
to
the
harassment.
and
i
think
that's
a
pretty
significant
cost.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
we
don't
--
i
guess,
we
don't
know
enough
about
the
threat
to
force
her
to
clean
the
toilets
for
a
year
to
know
whether
it's
only
one
thing.
but
it
could
be,
for
example,
that
if
there
--
in
the
scope
of
a
particular
day,
you
have
three
particular
options
as
to
what
you
might
do,
monitor
the
beach,
clean
the
facilities,
including
the
toilets,
or
prepare
meals,
then
it's
something
that
covers
the
entire
day.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no,
i
think
that
--
i
don't
think
we
have
an
answer
to
that
until
we
know
how
much
of
the
day's
work
is
encompassed
by
cleaning
the
toilets.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
he
--
he
controlled
every
aspect
of
her
--
of
her
day's
work,
and
cleaning
the
toilets
was
one
aspect
of
it.
so
that
was
a
particularly
poignant
example
that
he
visited
on
her
as
a
way
to
perpetuate
the
harassment.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
it
doesn't
constitute
authority
over
daily
work
activities.
and
i
guess
that's
what
the
eeoc
guidance
authorities--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--we
haven't
encountered
it
in
real
cases.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
they
haven't,
justice
breyer.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
they
have
not.
i'm
sorry.
they
have
not
turned
out
to
be
an
issue,
and
that's
what--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
they
haven't
--
i
guess
that's
two
components
to
the
answer,
mr.
chief
justice
--
they
haven't
generated
reported
or
underreported
decisions,
as
far
as
we've
seen.
and
this
is
not
scientific,
and
it's
just
based
on
our
conversations
with
the
eeoc
lawyers
who
are
charged
with
dealing
with
right
to
sue
letters
and
the
like.
they
haven't
encountered
these
sorts
of
situations.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
that
--
i
--
i
understand
that
that's
not
entirely
surprising,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--right.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
right.
in
our
conversations
with
them
about
the
way
in
which
these
issues
arise--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--and
i
don't
think
it
has,
justice
breyer.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
nature
of
this
inquiry
is
such
that
there's
going
to
be
cases
at
the
margins
that
raise
difficult
questions;
but,
in
ellerth,
the
court
recognized
that.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
that
if
there's
no
authority
over
--
to
--
to
direct
annual
employment
actions,
then--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
professor
would
not
qualify
as
a
supervisor
for
purposes
of
ellerth-faragher
framework.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
and
so
you'd
look
at
it
as
a
--
you'd
look
at
the
professor
as
a
coworker,
and
you'd
apply
the
same
standards
that
applied
to
harassment
conducted
by
the
coworker.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
and
i
think
that's
a
useful
frame
of
reference
that
i
was
trying
to
articulate
earlier,
which
is
that
we
can
envision
the
cases
as
falling
on
a
spectrum
between
ability
to
complain
when
the
harassment
is
perpetrated
by
a
coworker
on
the
one
hand,
and
ability
to
complain
when
harassment
is
perpetrated
by
a
supervisor
with
tangible
employment
authority--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--the
seventh
circuit
would
say
that
as
far
as
we
can
tell.
they
don't
appear
to
have
a
proviso
for
circumstances
in
which
the
harasser
has
a
role
in
determining
tangible
employment
actions,
because
that
is
one
thing
that
the
eeoc
guidance
takes
account
of.
it's
that
--
not
just
that
somebody
counts
as
a
supervisor
when
they
themselves
undertake
tangible
employment
action,
but
if
they
have
a
substantial
role
in
making
recommendations
that
in
turn
trigger
tangible
employment
actions,
the
eeoc
would
take
the
position
that
that
qualifies.
now,
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
but
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think
that
the
--
control
over
daily
work
activities
is
where
we
would
draw
the
line.
and
that's
what
has
come
up
the
most
in
the
cases.
the
reported
decisions
have
conflicts
on
--
have
a
conflict
on
that
issue,
and
that
is
where
the
eeoc
guidance
draws
the
line.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful,
if
the
court
were
going
to
issue
an
opinion
that
adopts
that
line,
to
elaborate
on
--
on
that
line
a
little
bit
in
the
following
sense:
that
relaying
instructions
that
are
--
that
are
disseminated
by
one
person
wouldn't
count
for
those
purposes.
that's
in
the
eeoc
guidance.
and
--
and
it's
the
functions
of
a
job
that
actually
matter,
not
the
job
title.
that
is
also
in
the
eeoc
guidance.
so
i
think
there
are
some
aspects
of
the
eeoc
guidance
that
elaborate
on
that
line
about
control
over
daily
activities
that
i
think
i
would
commend
to
the
court,
that
it
might
well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i'm
sorry?
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
--
i
think
the
real
question,
justice
sotomayor,
is
whether
the
parties
had
a
sufficient
opportunity
to
develop
the
record.
because
if
you
take
the
record
in
the
case
as
a
given,
we
think
that
the
record
would
support
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
for
ball
state
university,
because
there
isn't
a
sufficient
showing
in
the
record
if
you
take
it
as
a
given
that
the
relevant
supervisory
--
the
relevant
putative
supervisory
employee,
davis,
has
control
over
day-to-day
work
activities.
the
question
that
remains
is
whether
the
record
should
be
allowed
to
be
expanded.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
no.
i
think
if
you
take
the
record
as
a
given,
that
a
grant
of
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
employer
would
be
in
order.
but
in
the
normal
course
what
this
court
does
when
it
announces
a
new
standard
is
it
remands
for
the
lower
courts
to
deal
with
the
application
of
the
standard
to
the
facts.
and
the
conclusion
in
our
brief
is
just,
i
think,
a
parroting
of
that
normal
conclusion.
