justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
you've
looked
this
up.
and
apparently,
for
about
a
dozen
years,
the
eeoc
has
had,
as
--
as
an
alternative
basis
for
qualifying
as
a
supervisor,
the
individual
has
authority
to
direct
the
employee's
daily
work
activities.
and
in
addition,
we
have
three
circuits
that
for
some
period
of
years
have
been
following
roughly
the
same
kind
of
rule.
now,
has
this
problem
of
the
country
music
or
the
other
problems
raised,
have
they
turned
out
to
be
a
significant
problem
in
those
circuits
or
for
the
eeoc?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have,
or
they
have
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
guess
they'd
tell
you.
there
are
three
who
signed
the
brief,
or
four.
and
i
guess
they'd
tell
you,
wouldn't
they--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
the
problems
are,
if
they
have
problems.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
we
can
ask
the
other
side
the
same
question.
they've
seen
the
cases
in
the
circuits.
have
they
seen
instances
in
the
eeoc
or
before
the
circuits
where
it's
turned
out
to
be
a
serious
problem,
like
the
country
music
or
any
of
the
other
hypotheticals
raised?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
any?
you
said
he
went
through,
you
weren't
preceding
on
the
--
your
client,
originally
in
district
court,
not
preceding
on
the
basis
of
the
straight
seventh
circuit
test.
he
had
the
eeoc
look
into
it;
the
government
itself
says
that
we
should
affirm
and
they
have
eeoc
lawyers
on
it.
and
so
is
there
any
piece
of
information
that
would
be
relevant
that
you
know
of
that
you
would
introduce,
were
it
sent
back,
say
to
the
district
court,
that
you
have
not
already
introduced?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
read
what
they
said
in
the
last
page
of
their
brief.
they
said
either
affirm,
that
was
their
first
thing,
or
send
it
back.
okay.
now
my
question
remains
the
same.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
it?
