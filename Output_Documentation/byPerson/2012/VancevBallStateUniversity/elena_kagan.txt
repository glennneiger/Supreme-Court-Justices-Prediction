mr.
ortiz,
suppose
i
agree
with
your
standard,
but
i
just
can't
find
on
the
record
as
it
has
been
presented
in
this
court
any
evidence
that
davis
actually
served
as
vance's
supervisor.
what
--
i
mean,
what's
your
best
--
so
if
that's
true,
i
would
be
tempted
to
actually
just
decide
the
thing
rather
than
to
remand
it.
so
as
against
that
approach,
what
is
your
best
evidence
that
there
was
a
supervisory
relationship
under
your
standard
here?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
is
that
the
case?
is
there
evidence
that
you
did
not
present
because
the
seventh
circuit
applied
a
different
standard?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
ask
you
how
the
seventh
circuit
test
works
in
operation?
we're
in
a
university
setting
here,
so
let
me
give
you
a
university
hypo.
there's
a
professor,
and
the
professor
has
a
secretary.
and
the
professor
subjects
that
secretary
to
living
hell,
complete
hostile
work
environment
on
the
basis
of
sex,
all
right?
but
the
professor
has
absolutely
no
authority
to
fire
the
secretary.
what
would
the
seventh
circuit
say
about
that
situation?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
no,
the
secretary
is
fired
by
the
head
of
secretarial
services.
professors
don't
have
the
ability
to
fire
secretaries;
but,
professors
do
have
the
ability
to
make
secretarial
lives
living
hells.
so
what
does
the
seventh
circuit
say
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
under
the
seventh
circuit
test.
justice
elena
kagan
even
though,
of
course,
it's
actually
more
difficult
for
the
secretary
to
complain
about
the
professor
than
it
would
be
for
the
secretary
to
complain
about
the
head
of
secretarial
services.
justice
elena
kagan
and
mr.
srinivasan,
if
i
can
just
continue
on
about
this,
because
i
just
don't
even
understand
the
seventh
circuit
test.
would
the
seventh
circuit
test
also
say
that
--
that
that
person
is
not
a
supervisor
even
if
the
professor
evaluates
the
secretary
on
a
yearly
basis?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
garre,
could
i
ask
you
about
that?
you
said
before
that
there
is
no
--
nothing
to
suggest
that
she
left
anything
on
the
table
because
of
the
nature
of
the
seventh
circuit
standard.
so
what's
the
best
place
in
the
record
for
us
to
look
to
decide
that
question
as
to
whether
she
at
all
didn't
present
or
didn't
develop
evidence
because
of
the
nature
of
the
seventh
circuit
standard?
