mr.
ortiz,
why
isn't
the
question
that
you're
presenting
academic
in
this
case?
because
didn't
the
district
judge
say
that
there
had
been
no
showing
that
davis'
conduct
was
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive?
it
wouldn't
matter
if
the
supervisor
--
if
the
conduct
was
not
sufficiently
severe
or
pervasive
harassment,
and,
equally,
if
the
company
responded
every
time
a
complaint
was
lodged.
the
district
court
found
both
of
those
things,
that
it
wasn't
severe
and
pervasive,
and
that
every
time
she
complained
an
investigation
was
made.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
other
than
the
job
description?
the
job
description
says
that
the
catering
specialist
has
authority
to
direct
or
lead
the
part-time
employees.
but
what
concrete
instances
of
davis
exercising
supervisory
authority
over
vance
is
there
in
this
record?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
i
mean
is
not
the
statement,
well,
she's
a
supervisor.
but
comparable
to
faragher,
where
the
lifeguard
who
didn't
have
authority
to
hire
her
or
fire
her
said,
if
you
don't
date
me,
you
are
going
to
be
cleaning
the
toilets.
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
in
this
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
also
--
that
would
be
for
a
very
confined
period.
it
would
only
be
when
the
--
when
vance
was
a
part-time
employee.
once
she
is
a
full-time
employee
there
isn't
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ortiz,
did
she
ever
have
that
authority,
because
the
record
as
far
as
we
have
it
says
that
the
work
assignment,
what
vance
was
doing,
came
from
the
chef
or
from
kimes,
and
the
most
that
davis
did
was
transmit
the
chef's
orders
of
where
people
would
be
stationed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
have
you
answered
the
argument
it
shouldn't
get
any
deference
because
what
--
what
the
eeoc
guidance
does
is
it
is
--
it
is
interpreting
two
decisions
of
this
court,
and
this
court,
not
the
eeoc,
is
in
the
best
position
to
determine
what
those
two
cases
mean?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
in
faragher
it
was
that
--
that
the
lifeguard
gave
her
her
daily
work
assignments.
he
controlled
what
she
would
do
on
the
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
--
that
question
wasn't
presented.
it
was
--
it
was
just
assumed
that
--
that
silverman
would
qualify
as
a
--
as
a
supervisor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
should
that
--
why
should
that
matter?
i
know
you
said
that
in
your
brief,
mr.
garre,
if
the
alleged
victim
talked
back.
but
in
one
of
the
very
first
cases
that
we
had
in
this
line,
harris
v.
forklift,
there
was
--
it
was
the
boss,
so
there
was
no
question
about
supervisor,
and
he
was
really
making
things
hard
for
this
employee;
but,
she
was
very
firm,
and
she
talked
back
to
him.
but,
still,
that's
not
what
we
said
that
counted.
we
said,
is
she
being
subjected
to
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
that
she
would
not
be
subjected
to
but
for
her
sex.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ortiz
said
it
wasn't
just
part-time.
he
called
my
attention
to
the
page
before
that
says
she
also
--
that
davis
also
directed--
