mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
who
counts
and
who
does
not
count
as
a
supervisor
under
title
vii.
the
parties
and
the
united
states
agree
that
the
seventh
circuit
rule
violates
the
holding
of
faragher,
the
reasoning
of
faragher
and
this
court's
other
central
title
vii
precedents,
including
burlington
northern
and
staub,
and
the
common-sense
meaning
of
the
word
“
supervisor
”.
the
parties
even
agree
as
to
the
general
legal
standard,
although
they
style
it
a
little
bit
different
--
differently,
that
those
harassers
whose
employer-conferred
authority
over
their
victims
enables
or
materially
augments
the
harassment
should
count
as
supervisors.
this
is
not
a
standard,
your
honor,
that
imposes
automatic
liability
on
employers.
victims
must
still
prove
actionable
harassment,
and
employers
can
still
take
advantage
of
the
ellerth/faragher
affirmative
defense.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
no,
your
honor,
because
in
that
circumstance
the
adverse
action
would
not
amount
to
--
would
not
be
severe.
or,
perhaps
it
would
be
pervasive--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--well,
no,
your
honor,
this
is
the
--
the
severity
is
an
objective
standard;
it's
not
a
subjective.
so
in
this
case,
someone's
intense
dislike
--
maybe
it's
debilitating,
subjective
--
dislike
of
rock
music,
some
forms
of
country
music
--
might
impair
the
performance
of
some
in
the
workplace;
but,
from
an
objective
reasonable
employee's
standpoint,
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
the
case.
not
all--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--oh,
for
sure,
your
honor,
but
they
have
to
be
judged
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
the
respondent
actually
exaggerates
the
determinativeness
of
the
seventh
circuit
rule,
and
the
indeterminativeness
--
both
indeterminativeness
and
unpredictability
of
the
second
circuit
rule.
the
seventh
circuit
itself
has
recognized
--
the
judges
in
the
seventh
circuit
itself
have
recognized
that
the
rule
does
not
really
well
fit
the
realities
of
the
workplace.
it
also
just
moves
uncertainty
from
one
category
to
another.
the
category
of
supervisor
may
be
a
little
bit
tidier;
but,
under
the
seventh
circuit's
approach,
the
category
of
co-worker
is
very
unpredictable.
the
seventh
circuit
itself,
in
doe
v.
oberweis
dairy,
recognized
that
once
you
move
people
who
can
take
--
have
this
kind
of
power
over
their
victims
but
can't
actually
take
annual
employment
actions
against
them
into
the
category
of
co-workers,
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
to
apply
a
sliding
scale
of
negligence.
not
only
that,
but
the
jury
is
the
one
who
applies
it.
so
for
those
categories
--
this
exact
category
of
employee,
your
honor,
the
employer
going
forward
has
very
little
idea
of
whether
--
what
standard
of
care
is
that
a
particular
jury
would
apply
in
that
case
and
whether
the
jury
would
decide
it
is
met
or
not.
the
seventh
circuit
rule,
in
the
overall,
is
no
more
determinative
than
the
second
circuit
rule.
also,
respondent
points
to
no
cases
in
the
second
circuit
or
the
other
circuits
that
have
adopted
this
rule
where
courts
have
identified
problems
with
its
application.
and
that--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--it
has
to
be
sufficient
to
enable
the
harasser
to
instill
either
fear
in
the
victim
that
the
victim
should
not
turn
the
harasser
in,
or
that
it
may
have
to
do
with
the
harasser's
ability
to
control
the
physical
location
of
the
victim.
that
can
augment
harassment.
if
an
harasser
can
steer
a
victim
to
a
location
where
the
harasser
has
an
opportunity
to
harass,
and,
indeed,
may
have
an
opportunity
to
harass
without
other
employees
or
other
people
in
the
company
seeing
in,
that
would
materially
augment--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--well,
your
honor,
this--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--justice
alito,
this
part
of
the
standard,
particularly
the
materiality
requirement,
is
meant
to
track
this
court's
standard
in
burlington
northern,
where
it
said
that
only
actions
that
are
materially
adverse
to
the
employee
would
count.
and
this
court
identified
the
materiality
requirement
there
as
actually
working
to
make
the
standard
more
objective,
not--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--justice
ginsburg,
we
actually
tried
to
bring
those
things
up
before
the
seventh
circuit,
but
the
seventh
circuit
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
them
because
of
its
holding
as
to
supervisory
liability.
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
seventh
circuit's
affirmance
of
summary
judgment
of
the
district
court,
the
case
would
then
be
remanded
to
the
seventh
circuit,
where
it
could
either
look
at
these
alternative
--
these
other
holdings,
or
the
thing
would
be
--
it
could
be
remanded
at
that
point
and
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
another
look.
the
district
court's
reasoning,
the
seventh
circuit
noted,
when
it
was
talking
about
other
incidents
of
harassment
was
very
unusual.
what
the
district
court
did
was
it
divided
all
of
the
incidents
into
two
categories.
one
category
--
one
category
consisted
of
events
that
by
themselves
were
not
overtly
racial
in
nature
and
the
other
category
consisted
of
those
events
that
were
overtly
racial
in
nature,
where
a
racial
epithet
had
been
hurled
at
someone,
for
example,
and
said
with
respect
to
the
first
category,
the
things
--
the
events
that
on
their
face
did
not
announce
racial
animosity,
that
there
wasn't
any
racial
nexus,
so
they
didn't
count,
and
swept
all
those
events
out
and
then
looked
at
the
remaining
ones
where
the
connection
to
racial
animus
was
overt.
and
it
said,
well,
these,
there
may
be
some,
but
they
just
don't
count.
so
the
seventh
circuit
itself
discredited
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
those
very
holdings.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
first,
justice
kagan,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
record
was
developed
under
the
wrong
legal
standard.
but
even
considering
that--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--there
was
evidence
that
was
probably
not
developed
below
because
the
seventh
circuit's
standard
was
so
absolute.
but
there
is
actually
evidence
in
the
record,
we
believe
plenty
of
evidence,
sufficient
certainly
to
overcome
summary
judgment,
although
perhaps
not
enough
for
partial
summary
judgment
on
this
question
in
our
favor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
justice
--
there
is
two
separate
questions,
justice
ginsburg.
one
is
instances
of
it;
others
is
whether
she
has
the
authority
or
not.
because
this
court
has
held
in
faragher
itself
that
it
is
the
authority
that
makes
the
difference,
not
the
actual
exercising
of
it
in
a
particular
case.
but
let
me
go
through
what
is
in
the
record
now,
much
of
it
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
but
not
all,
because
we
were
not
aware
that
we
would
be
opposing
a
summary
judgment
motion
before
this
court.
first,
william
kimes,
who
is
the
director
of
the
university
banquet
and
catering
division,
thus
the
head
of
this
60-some-person
department.
two
employees
testified
that
he
told
them
that
davis
was
a
supervisor.
one
of
them
was
vance;
that
could
be
found
on
page
198
of
the
joint
appendix.
another
is
an
employee
who
was
in
vance's
position
named
dawn
knox,
and
that
statement
can
be
found
on
page
386
of
the
joint
appendix.
william
kimes
himself
testified
in
his
deposition
that
davis,
quote:
"directed
and
led
other
employees
in
the
kitchen.
"
that
can
be
found
on
page
367
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
an
internal
investigation
by
compliance
officers
at
ball
state--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--well,
there
was
no
overt
threat
like
that
in
the
record,
but
the
person
who
was
hurling
racial
epithets
at
her
was
in
a
position
of
authority
over
her,
both
according
to
the
job
description,
also
according
to
her
understanding,
according--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--no,
your
honor.
there
is
two
separate
provisions
in
the
job
description
which
cover
the
whole
period
of
time
here.
the
harassment
started
around
september
2005,
went
in
through
august
--
went
to
august
2007
with
one
incident,
march
1st,
i
believe
it
was,
2008.
on
january
1st,
2007,
ms.
vance
received
a
promotion
from
part-time
to
full-time.
page
13
on
the
joint
appendix
has
this
item
that
you
pointed
to,
justice,
which
specifically
lists
among
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
the
catering
specialist
leading
and
directing
part-time
employees.
however,
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix
lists
under
positions
supervised
by
the
catering
specialist,
exactly
vance's
position.
so
when
she
moved
from
full-time
--
sorry,
from
part-time
to
full-time
in
january
2007,
the
supervisory
nexus
in
the
job
description
merely
jumped
from
page
13
to
page
12.
but
it
was
covered
for
that
whole
period
of
time.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
certainly
within
the
--
within
the
job
duties
that
she
traditionally
did,
the
kind
of
things
she
had
to
work
with,
what
she
had
to
do,
things
like
this,
working
with
onions,
chopping
onions
all
day
might
be
punishment.
unfortunately
again,
though,
the
record
wasn't
developed
under
an
understanding
that
all
of
this
would
be
irrelevant.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
possibly,
your
honor.
it
depends,
again,
on
questions
which
would
depend
upon
how
you
had
to
chop,
how
heavy
the
knives
were,
whether
you
would
get
repetitive
injuries.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
your
honor,
it
is
not
quite
clear
at
this
point.
vance,
in
an
internal
investigation
at
ball
state
university,
ms.
vance
told
the
compliance
officer
who
was
conducting
the
investigation
that
davis
delegated
jobs
to
her
in
the
kitchen.
that
appears
in
document
59-16
on
page
2.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
for
sure,
your
--
for
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
--
this
falls
out
of
the
structure
of
the
affirmative
defense
as
laid
out
in
ellerth
and
faragher.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
that
this
court
would
require
under
those
circumstances?
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
it
doesn't
actually
map
on
well
to
the
structure
of
the
affirmative
defenses
laid
out
in
ellerth
and
faragher.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
under
the
existing
affirmative
--
affirmative
defense,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
an
employee
who
doesn't
complain,
unless
they
are
reasonable
in
not
complaining,
in
most
cases
would
make
the
affirmative
defense
unavailable
to
the
employer.
is
it
the
question
concerning
the
difference
between
unreasonably
failing
to
complain--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--that
--
this
whole
--
the
fight
is
in
--
in
part
about
that
issue.
that
is
certainly
not
the
only--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes,
your
honor.
it
makes
it
better.
and
this
court
has
recognized
the
affirmative
defense
appropriately
allocates
the
burdens
between
the
employee
and
the
employer
going
forward.
your
honor,
the
seventh
circuit
rule,
although
unsupported
by
respondent,
is
supported
by
several
of
the
respondents'
amici.
as
i
said,
they
tend
to
oversell
the
determinativeness
of
the
seventh
circuit
rule.
they
exaggerate
the
--
the
uncertainties
that
they
predict
will
happen
under
the--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--your
honor--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--it
is
--
it
is
entitled
to
deference
under
skidmore,
no
more.
and
it
is
our
understanding,
although
the
government--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--because
it's
--
it's
only
informal
guidance,
your
honor.
it
hasn't
gone
through
rulemaking,
formal
adjudication
and
those
processes
which
elevate
the
amount
of
deference--
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
--well,
your
honor,
it's
a
little
bit
contentious
on
this
court.
no,
your
honor,
it's
a
little
bit
contentious
on
this
court;
but,
following
head
products,
for
example,
it
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
more
than
skidmore
deference.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
what
it
is,
your
honor,
is
it
represents
an
interpretation
of
the
word
“
agent
”
in
title
vii.
now,
where
--
where
the
statute
--
the
statutory
term
gives
off
and
this
court's
interpretation
begins
is,
in
some
cases,
a
tough
question.
but
in
this
case,
the
eeoc
--
the
eeoc
is
really
giving
definition
to
the
word
“
agent
”
in
title
vii,
not
so
much
this
court's
interpretations
in
faragher
and
ellerth.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
seventh
circuit
rule
is
not
one
that
can
be
justified
in
terms
of
its
superior
judicial
manageability,
administrability,
despite
producing
a
few
odd
results.
as
justice
kagan's
question
revealed,
it
produces
truly
perverse
results.
someone
who
can
tell
you
what
to
do
in
your
job
day-to-day,
manage
you
during
the
whole
job
period,
what
kind
of
tasks
you
have
to
do,
was
not
necessarily
considered
a
supervisor,
while
the
person
upstairs
in
human
resources
that
you
may
never
see
or
even
know
would
be
considered
your
supervisor.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
justice
kennedy,
that
in
fact
is
one
thing
the
seventh
circuit
has
tried
to
do,
but
it
dispels
any
kind
of
certainty
and
predictability
in
the
rule,
because
the
duty
of
care
of
course
would
be
determined
by
a
jury
only
after
hearing
a
particular
case.
second,
my
friend
tries
to
get
out
from
under
the
clear
import
of
the
job
description
here
by
saying
directing
and
leading
somehow
don't
count
because
that
is
accomplished
through
oversight.
oversight,
however,
is
a
common
synonym
for
supervision
itself.
it's
merely
a
dog
chasing
its
own
tail.
third,
it's
no
surprise
that
many
of
the
things
that
ms.
vance
referred
to,
the
particular
instance
she
referred
to
went
back
to
william
kimes.
of
course,
that
related
to
the
retaliation
part
of
her
claim,
which
is
not
before
this
court.
also,
your
honor,
faragher
in
the
end
is
not
a
toilet
cleaning
case.
the
district
court
did
not
find
--
made
no
finding
on
that.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
mention
it.
this
court
in
its
faragher
opinion
mentioned
only
that
it
was
an
allegation
in
the
complaint.
it
is
not
clear
--
the
allegation
of
the
complainant
was
that
he
said
that,
not
that
silverman
actually
had
that
authority.
and
it
was
clear
from
the
case
that
he
actually
wasn't
interested
in
even
dating
faragher,
it
was
just
a
way
of
humiliating
her
in
the
workplace.
so
just
as
faragher's
expressed,
it
was
not
clear
that
was
even
something
that
silverman
had
authority
to
do.
and
finally,
if
this
court
is
worried
about
sending
signals,
think
about
what
kind
of
signal
it
will
be
sending
to
litigants
in
the
future
if
it
were
to
affirm,
simply
affirm
here.
in
the
future,
whenever
anyone
is
thinking
that
they
may
want
to
challenge
a
rule,
no
matter
how
well-settled
it
is
in
a
particular
circuit,
they
would
have
an
incentive
to,
through
discovery,
to
produce
information
that
might
be
relevant
to
any
future
twist.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
well,
your
honor,
first,
the
solicitor
general's
office
does
not
now
take
the
position
that
affirmance
is
proper.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
there
is.
mr.
daniel
r.
ortiz
on
page
197
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
the
deposition
testimony
of
ms.
vance,
she
says
that
davis
told
her
