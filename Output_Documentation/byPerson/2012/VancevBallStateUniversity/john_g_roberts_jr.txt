chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
11-556,
vance
v.
ball
state
university.
mr.
ortiz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
say
you
have
a
work
room.
there
are
five
people
who
work
there.
and
the
employer
has
a
rule
that
the
senior
employee
gets
to
pick
the
music
that's
going
to
play
all
day
long.
and
the
senior
employee
says
to
one
of
the
other
employees,
you
know,
if
you
don't
date
me
--
i
know
you
don't
like
country
music;
if
you
don't
date
me,
it's
going
to
be
country
music
all
day
long.
now,
that
affects
the
daily
activities
of
that
other
employee.
i
would
have
thought,
under
your
theory,
that
means
that
that
senior
employee
is
a
supervisor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
could
be
--
that
could
be
far
more
severe
than,
for
example--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
could
be
far
more
severe
than
simply
saying,
all
right,
you
know,
you're
going
to
--
as
in
this
case
--
you're
going
to
be
cutting
the
celery
rather
than,
you
know,
baking
the
bread,
or
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but,
i
mean,
there
are
places
where
the
environment
--
you
know,
an
assembly
line
or
something
like
that
--
where
the
task
may
not
be
that
different,
but
how
you
--
the
environment
in
which
you
have
to
perform
them
may
be
far
more
significant
than
whether
or
not
you're
attaching
the
door
handles
or
the
front
fenders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
exactly.
and
i
would
have
thought
the
benefit
of
the
seventh
circuit's
test
was
that
you
don't
have
to
go
through
those
case-by-case
basis.
i
think
we
can
have
a
reasonable
debate
about
whether
the
music
you
have
to
listen
to
for
eight
hours
is
objectively
a
significant
enough
interference
with
the
daily
activities
to
qualify
under
your
test.
but
the
seventh
circuit
test
makes
clear
--
it
doesn't
give
any
kind
of
immunity;
it
just
makes
clear
what
type
of
analysis
is
going
to
be
applied
to
the
allegation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
srinivasan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
the
music
hypothetical?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
--
where
do
you
think
your
test
comes
out
on
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
--
it
doesn't
really
have
to
do
with
the
number
of
tasks.
it
isn't
an
assignment
of
tasks.
it's
something
that
clearly
affects
the
daily
activities
of
the
employee
in
a
way
that
could
be
used
to
implement
or
facilitate
harassment.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
--
and
your
tests
sort
of
use
that,
just
as
you've
posed
it,
as
some
broad
continuum
in
which
we're
going
to
have
countless
cases
trying
to
figure
out
whether
music
falls
closer
to
this
end
or,
you
know,
what
--
the
senior
employee
controls
the
thermostat,
is
that
closer
to
this
end
or
that
end?
or
cutting
onions?
it
seems
to
me
that
every
single
case
has
its
own
peculiar
facts,
and
courts
are
going
to
be
--
have
to
figure
out
where
on
the
continuum
it
resides.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
you
know
that?
are
you
just
saying
they
have
not
generated
actual
federal
--
federal
court
reported
cases?
do
you
have
any
idea
how
this
works
on
the
ground
when
people
complain
about
the
exercise
of
authority
by
a
coworker
who
has
specific
responsibilities
that
might
be
reviewed
as
supervisory?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
eeoc
lawyers
think
the
eeoc
plan
is
working
just
fine.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
--
you've
talked
several
times
about
this
going
along
the
spectrum.
where
--
where
are
we
supposed
to
cut
off
the
--
where's
the
cutting
line
in
the
spectrum?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
every
--
every
time
--
every
time
you
adopt
a
rule
rather
than
a
multifactor
analysis,
there
are
going
to
be
particular
cases
that
fall
outside
the
rule
that
look
like
a
harsh
result.
now,
here
it
simply
affects
the
nature.
it
doesn't
give
any
immunity
for
harassment,
it
just
affects
the
nature
of
the
showing
that
might
be
made.
you
have
no
difficulty,
as
representing
an
employer,
by
saying
that
in
every
case
an
allegation
of
this
sort
is
made
you
have
to
go
through
a
case-by-case
description
of
the
particular
responsibilities,
whether
it's
the
thermostat,
whether
it's
the
music,
whether
it's
the
assignment
of
everything
that
the
employee
does,
and
decide
on
that
basis
whether
or
not
you
should
compensate
the
victim,
or
--
or
whether
or
not
you
should
go
to
court?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
i
think
your
friend
on
the
other
side
was
--
made
a
good
point
in
his
reply
brief,
which
is
the
variety
of
circumstances
you
think
courts
should
look
at
just
happen
to
correspond
with
the
factual
issues
that
you
would
have
resolved
in
your
favor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
ortiz,
you
have
4
more
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
all
in
the
record
in
this
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-556,
vance
versus
ball
state
university.
