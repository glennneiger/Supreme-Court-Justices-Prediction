justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
leave
out?
what
does
it
leave
out,
your
theory?
a
policeman's
a
law
enforcement
officer.
what
does
he
do
on
his
job
that
isn't
in
a
law
enforcement
role?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
idea
here
is
a
park
policeman
who
is
engaged
in
law
enforcement
some
of
the
time,
but
engaged
in
giving
tours
the
rest
of
the
time.
you're
saying
what
you
would
do
is
say
when
he's
engaged
in
the
law
enforcement
he's
covered,
but
not
when
he's
engaged
in
the
tour.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
isn't
this
--
why
isn't
what
the
prison
guard
does
law
enforcement?
i
mean,
the
law
says
these
people
are
going
to
be
locked
up
and
he's
enforcing
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
going
to
be
in
prison
under
these
da,
da,
da,
da,
da.
you
know,
all
that
da,
da,
da
means
the
conditions
of
the
prison,
et
cetera,
they're
all
regulations,
rules,
statutes.
he's
enforcing
them,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
so
now
you're
saying
what
those
three
things
could
provide
the
definition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
are
you
saying
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
epa
is
not
what
i'm
thinking
of,
i
don't
think
they
are.
i
am
thinking
of
police.
okay.
now,
one
basic
job
of
a
policeman
is
to
patrol,
but
not
arresting
people,
not
searching
and
not
seizing
evidence.
they
are
on
patrol.
that's
basically
what
they
do.
all
right?
is
that
a
law
enforcement
activity?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
but
i
mean
in
places
--
it's
federal,
i
understand.
so
i'm
sure
we
can
find
analogies
in
the
federal
situation
to
ordinary
policemen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
fbi
agents,
who
are
the
federal
police,
they're
people
on
federal
enclaves,
for
example,
there
are
--
they
are
on
federal
enclaves,
they
act
like
policemen,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
fair.
i
mean,
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
either
you
can
have
a
broad
definition
or
one
that's
going
to
get
into
trouble
when
we
consider
real
policemen.
so
if
you
have
a
broad
one,
then
i
don't
see
how
prison
guards
get
out
of
it.
if
you
have
a
narrow
one,
my
guess
is
we
could
find
lots
of
federal
policemen
who
really
are
policemen
who
aren't
doing
what
falls
--
who
are
doing
what
falls
outside
your
narrow
definition.
i
wish
i
could
think
of
better
examples,
but
i
came
up
with
the
ones
i
did.
