justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
prove
that
they're
officers.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
not
the
test
for
an
officer,
how
much
you're
paid.
the
test
is
whether
you
exercise
significant
authority
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
that's
a
pretty
fuzzy
line,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
a
prison
guard
exercises
significant
authority
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
will
give
you
--
i'll
give
you
a
textual
basis.
why
is
it
if
all
the
statute
is
concerned
about
is
the
status
of
being
a
law
enforcement
--
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officer
--
why
is
it
that
the
exception
it
makes
does
not
eliminate
the
exemption
for
libel,
slander,
misrepresentation,
deceit
or
interference
with
contract
rights?
there
is
excepted
from
the
provisions
of
the
tort
claims
act
any
claim
arising
out
of
assault,
battery,
false
imprisonment,
false
arrest,
malicious
prosecution,
abusive
process,
libel,
slander,
misrepresentation,
deceit
or
interference
with
contract
rights.
however,
for
--
for
purposes
of
this
exemption
from
the
exemption
--
the
exception
from
the
exemption,
they
leave
out
the
latter
part.
why
did
they
only
put
in
the
others?
i
think
the
reason
they
only
put
in
the
others
is
that
those
are
the
kind
of
torts
that
would
be
conducted
in
the
course
of
conducting
a
--
what's
the
words
--
investigative
or
law
enforcement
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
others
would
not
--
would
not
occur.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it's
--
it's
a
limiting
factor
that
--
that
shows,
that
displays
an
intent
to
limit
the
--
the
activities
of
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officers
to
those
activities
conducted
in
the
course
of
investigating
or
enforcing
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
it
leave
out
those
other
ones?
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
what
possible
reason
is
there
to
leave
out
libel,
slander,
misrepresentation,
deceit,
or
interference
with
contract
rights?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
--
i
didn't
deny
that
it's
the
judgment.
what
reason
could
there
be
for
that
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
give
you
a
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reason
--
the
reason
they
left
it
out
is
that
they
don't
think
those
torts
would
be
committed
in
the
course
of
investigating
or
enforcing
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
yang,
the
united
states
didn't
take
this
position
below,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
change
of
heart.
how
long
ago
was
it
that
the
united
states
took
the
opposite
position,
the
position
argued
by
amicus
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
couldn't
be
that
obvious,
i
guess?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
suggest
why
congress
might
have
left
out
libel,
slander,
misrepresentation?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
would
they
leave
that
out
if
they
are
only
looking
at
the
office
and
not
at
the
function
that
the
person
is
performing?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
mean,
that's
the
point.
so
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
suggests
that
they
mean
federal
law
enforcement
officers
engaged
in
law
enforcement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
think
the
epa
is
engaged
in
law
enforcement
when
it
enforces
statutes
and
regulations,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
an
officer
of
the
epa
be
a
law
enforcement
officer
when
he
writes
a
letter
to
a
company
saying,
you
know,
you
are
violating
section
such-and-such
of
the
statute?
is
that
a
law
enforcement
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
that
the
government
is
trying
to
minimize
the
consequences
of
coming
out
its
way
by
providing
a
definition
of
the
officers
covered,
which
will
not
hold.
you
think
it
does
cover
a
broader
category
of
officers
including
osha
inspectors,
but
it
does
not
cover
them
when
they
are
not
engaged
in
law
enforcement
activities.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
support
the
government's
position
on
who's
an
officer,
right?
so
it
wouldn't
include
epa.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
a
yes
or
a
no?
