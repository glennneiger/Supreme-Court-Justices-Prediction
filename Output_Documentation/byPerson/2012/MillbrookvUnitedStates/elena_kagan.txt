what
are
the
kinds
of
things,
mr.
yang,
that
would
be
within
the
scope
of
employment,
but
would
not
be
acting
within
a
law
enforcement
capacity
for
a
law
enforcement
officer?
what's
the
difference
between
those
two
standards
for
a
law
enforcement
officer?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
can't
give
me
just
a
couple
of
examples
of
how
the
difference
would
matter,
you
know,
in
some
states,
where
something
would
be
--
would
meet
the
scope
of
employment
test,
but
not
meet
the
acting
as
a
law
enforcement
officer
test,
for
a
law
enforcement
officer
again.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bucholtz,
the
statute
itself
has
a
kind
of
conduct-based
limitation
in
it.
it
says
law
enforcement
officers
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
so
i
guess
my
question
is,
given
that
there
is
that
conduct-based
limitation
in
the
statute,
why
one
would
substitute
for
it
law
enforcement
officers
acting
as
law
enforcement
officers?
why
wouldn't
one
use
just
the
conduct-based
limitation
that's
already
there?
justice
elena
kagan
but
again,
it's
not
just
any
acts
of
law
enforcement
officers.
it's
acts
of
law
enforcement
officers
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
and
now
you're
saying
acting
as
a
law
enforcement
officer.
i
mean,
one
question
i
suppose
i
have,
which
is
the
same
question
that
i
gave
to
mr.
yang,
is
what's
the
difference
between
those
two
things?
and
i
guess
the
second
question
is:
why
would
we
substitute
one
phrase
about
how
they
have
to
be
acting
for
the
phrase
that
congress
actually
used?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bucholtz,
i'm
sure
you
have
done
this
already,
so
i
apologize,
but
could
you
just
state
your
definition
of
what
it
means
to
be
acting
as
a
law
enforcement
officer?
what
activities
other
than
the
three
listed
get
included?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
don't
have
your
own
--
so
what
else
gets
in
the
mix?
how
would
you
define
it
generally?
justice
elena
kagan
maybe?
i
mean,
yes
or
no
or
when
or--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
if
we're
going
to
adopt
your
definition,
we
have
to
have
some
understanding
of
where
it's
taking
us.
justice
elena
kagan
have
they
also
adopted
the
government's
view
of
what
counts
as
an
officer,
or
have
they
not?
