justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you've
argued
something
slightly
different
than
i
took
from
your
briefs.
earlier,
in
response
i
think
to
justice
ginsburg,
you
were
queueing
closer
to
the
solicitor
general's
position
that
this
has
to
be
limited
in
some
way.
and
you
said
you'll
let
them
establish
the
boundaries.
i
don't
want
to
let
them
establish
the
boundaries.
i
want
you
to
tell
me,
is
it
criminal
law
enforcement
agents,
is
it
law
enforcement
agents
with
--
acting
--
as
the
ninth
circuit
says
--
acting
within
a
law
enforcement
activity?
because
i
am
finding
it
hard
to
figure
out
why
we
shouldn't
permit
tort
liability
on
an
osha
inspector,
who,
in
inspecting
whatever
he
or
she
is
inspecting
punches
someone
or
does
some
intentional
assaultive
act,
why
they
should
be
permitted
to
do
that.
assuming
it
falls
within
the
definition
of
a
law
enforcement
activity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
they're
saying
is
arrests,
search
and
seizure,
and
whatever
the
third
was.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
let's
define
it
more
broadly.
let's
assume
i
was
willing
to
define
it
to
include
all
of
the
activities
that
a
law
enforcement
agent
would
engage
in,
including
protective
services,
security
services,
like
your
officers.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
that
we've
defined
it
more
broadly.
what's
the
problem
with
their
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
of
--
yes,
with
amicus's
or
the
government's,
meaning,
instead
of
limiting
it
to
criminal
activity,
limited
to
law
enforcement
activities
broadly
defined.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
go
back
and
tell
me,
yet
again
--
you
give
a
limiting
principle,
but
i'm
not
sure
how
it
applies.
you
seem
to
be
saying
--
do
you
agree
with
your
--
with
the
petitioner
that
law
enforcement
officer
includes
correction
officers?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
why?
because
they
have
all
of
those
other
powers,
so
how
is
that
different
from
those
in
the
civil
area
who
have
similar
powers
to
arrest,
search
and
seize,
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
about
customs
agents?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
my
problem
is
park
employees
i
think
of
as
officers
when
you
meet
them
at
the
parks.
they
are
guarding
the
parks.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
they
may
also
be
giving
tours.
they
are
usually
doing
sort
of
a
mixture
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--duties.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
we
adopted
the
definition
justice
scalia
just
proposed,
law
enforcement
officer
engaged
in
law
enforcement
activities.
would
correction
officers
be
engaged
in
law
enforcement
activities?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
can
look
at
it
both
ways.
are
correction
officers
as
officers
who
are
protecting
or
securing
prisoners,
are
they
acting
in
a
law
enforcement
capacity
in
your
--
forget
about
what
act,
what
tort
they
commit,
but
do
they
function--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--okay.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what
--
what
is
it
about
a
corrections
officer
other
than
the
act
that
was
committed
here,
which
was
an
alleged
sexual
act
which
nobody
could,
except
by
some
definition
of
state
law,
think
that
that
ever
happens
naturally
in
the
course.
but
that's
an
intentional
assault.
the
very
definition
of
the
crimes
that
are
covered
assumes
that
it's
not
an
act
that's
licensed.
so,
why
isn't
the
correction
officer
acting
in
a
law
enforcement
capacity
when
he's
restraining
people
and
securing
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
what
happens
--
what
happens
in
the
police
precinct
when
police
officers
are
holding
pretrial
detainees?
are
they
acting
as
police
officers
or
as
security
people?
or
even
when
a
prisoner
comes
back
to
court
for
a
court
appearance
and
there
are
u.s.
marshals
who
guard
them
rather
than
correction
officers,
what
are
they
serving
as
in
your
mind?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
other
advantage
of
your
definition
is
that
it
takes
us
out
of
workplace
fights
between
two
employees,
because
presumably
the
officers
who
punch
each
other
out,
if
that
incident
occurs,
aren't
acting
in
a
law
enforcement
capacity.
i
am
assuming
that
is
part
of
your
argument
as
well.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
then
it
goes
back
to
the
question
i
asked
one
of
your
adversaries,
which
is
all
of
this
depends
on
how
broadly
or
narrowly
we
define
law
enforcement
activities.
if
we
take
it
as
broadly
as
the
government
is
suggesting,
at
moments,
it
would
--
we
could
very
well
say,
you
are
right,
it's
a
law
enforcement
activity,
but
not
as
narrowly
as
some
would
have
it
be.
it
would
include
securing
or
detaining
people,
or
securing
or
detaining
people.
and
it
would
include
the
park
service
person
who
stops
a
visitor
and
punches
them
out.
it
would
include
the
military
personnel
who
stops
someone
and
does
an
intentional
tort
against
them,
even
though
they
may
just
be
walking
on
the
grounds
rather
than
serving
as
security
that
particular
day.
so
the
point
is,
why
should
we
give
it
the
narrow
reading
you
are
giving,
and
not
the
broader
reading
the
government
seems
to
be
suggesting?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
difference
between
the
officer
who
punches
the
prisoner
to
get
him
on
the
ground
and
pick
him
up?
would
it
apply
to
the
officer
who
files
an
arrest
complaint
against
the
prisoner,
and
not
to
the
security
officer
who
just
merely
carries
him
back
to
his
cell?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
does
some
physical
injury
that's
substantial.
so
the
intentional
assault
gets
treated
as
an
exception
to
this
only
when
the
security
officer
actually
files
an
arrest
complaint?
or
would
it
at
all?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
