would
that
include,
say,
a
meat
--
a
meat
inspector?
there
is
a
wide
range
of
federal
employees
that
have
arrest
or
search
or
seizure--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
understand--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
view
is
that
the
limitation
is
scope
of
employment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
scope
of
employment
is,
and
you
don't
add
on
anything
else
to
that.
you
don't
add
arrest,
search
and
seizure.
but
does
this
whole
issue
have
an
academic
flavor,
because
how
in
the
world
could
the
conduct
involved
in
this
case
qualify
as
within
the
scope
of
employment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yang,
even
if
--
if
--
it
depends
on
state
law,
that's
clear.
but
does
the
united
states
sometimes
concede
scope
of
authority
so
it
can
represent
--
it
can
be
the
sole
defendant
in
the
case,
the
individual
officer
is
off
the
hook,
so
that
the
united
states
could
make
the
argument:
it
never
happened;
the
officer
didn't
do
what
the
plaintiff
charged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask,
in
light
of
your
opening
statement,
are
you
then
abandoning
your
position
that
it
must
be
either
arrest,
search
or
seizure?
you
have
used
the
ninth
circuit
formula.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
a
limitation?
is
scope
a
limitation?
i
thought
that
you
--
you
didn't
question
that,
that
scope
is
a
limitation
on
the
conduct
that's
covered,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
takedown
that
occurred
here
and
i
--
it's
not
uncommon.
the
--
your
definition
includes
three
things,
arrest,
search,
seizure.
and
correctional
officers
do
engage
in
searches
of
cells
for
contraband,
and
they
do
engage
in
seizures.
those
are
not
--
this
isn't
like
arrest,
which
you
point
out
the
arrest
is
unusual;
it's
an
escapee
or
a
visitor.
but
that's
not
true
of
search
and
seizure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
scope
becomes
kind
of
a
surplusage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
has
to
be
a
law
enforcement
function.
give
--
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
where
--
where
scope
would
also
be
relevant,
would
also
be
applicable
--
if
you
--
if
there
is
a
law
enforcement
function,
then
it
fits.
so
what
does
scope
add?
