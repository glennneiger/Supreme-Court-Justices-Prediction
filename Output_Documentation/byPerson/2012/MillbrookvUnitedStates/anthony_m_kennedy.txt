justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
a
general
matter,
first
in
the
states
and
then
in
the
federal
government,
is
a
correctional
officer
or
prison
guard
usually
deemed
to
be
a
peace
officer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
strong
textual
argument
for
your
position.
but
let
me
ask
this:
are
there
any
studies
or
any
statistics
we
can
look
at
to
see
as
a
predictive
matter
how
many
prison
suits
against
the
government
this
ruling
that
you
propose
would
--
would
cause?
it
seems
to
me
we
have
close
to
200,000
federal
prisoners,
i
think,
and
this
prison
work,
there
is
a
lot
of
shoving,
guards
have
to
break
up
fights.
so
there
is
going
to
be
any
number
of
instances
where
the
question
is
did
the
guard
overreach.
and
if
i
make
the
assumption,
and
it's
just
an
assumption
because
i
haven't
looked
at
any
statistics,
but
there
is
--
this
is
going
to
vastly
expand
the
number
of
cases
in
which
the
government
is
the
defendant.
doesn't
that
bear
on
the
likelihood
of
the
congressional
intent
to
adopt
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
and
then
--
then
take
that
theory
and
track
through
the
statute
to
show
me
how
that
theory
works,
which
is
what
your
opening
argument
was
going
to
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
how
does
that
argument
help
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
prisoner
--
a
prisoner
is
supposed
to
be
back
in
his
cell
block
at
6:00
in
the
evening,
he
isn't,
he's
on
the
recreation
yard,
he's
somewhat
recalcitrant,
and
two
guards
carry
him
back
to
the
cell
block.
is
that
an
arrest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he's
violating
the
prison
regulations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
not
a
law
enforcement
function
as
contemplated
by
the
statute,
in
your
view?
