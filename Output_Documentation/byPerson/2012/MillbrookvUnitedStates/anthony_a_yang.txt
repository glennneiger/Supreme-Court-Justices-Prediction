mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text
and
structure
of
the
law
enforcement
proviso
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
more
generally
make
clear
that
the
proviso
unambiguously
waives
sovereign
immunity
for
claims
arising
under
the
six
intentional
torts
listed
for
acts
or
omissions
of
persons
qualifying
as
federal
law
enforcement
officers
while
acting
within
their
scope
of
employment.
nothing
in
the
statute
supports
amicus's
additional
limit,
which
would
require
such
officers
to
be
acting
in
a
law
enforcement
capacity
or
by
exercising
law
enforcement
authority,
neither
of
which
phrase
occurs
within
the
statute
itself.
quite
the
contrary--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
this
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
for
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
scope
of
employment
is
a
question
that
turns
on
state
law.
as
a
result
it
will
vary.
some
states
have
a
rather
broad
understanding
of
scope
of
employment
and
sometimes
in
fact
will
encompass
within
the
scope
of
employment
rather
egregious
intentional
torts.
it's
not
necessarily
what
the
court
might
think
of
as
within
the
scope
of
one's
federal
law
enforcement
authority.
so
with
respect
to
law
enforcement
authority,
i
mean,
this
--
that
makes
the
question
a
little
more
difficult
because
that
is
not
something
that
actually
appears
in
the
statute
and
it's
not
something
that
the
united
states
embraces
as
a
test
because
it
is
a
creation
of
the
amicus.
what
the
statute
here
does,
the
only
term
--
the
only
place
that
it
uses
law
enforcement
is
in
the
defined
term
“
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officer
”
and
then
what
it
does
in
defining
that
term--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--again,
acting
as
a
law
enforcement
officer
test
is
not
something
that
appears
in
the
statute
and
it's
not
something
that
even
amicus
has
tried
to
meet
the
limitations
of.
it
could
mean
various
things.
it
could
mean,
for
instance,
something
as
limited
as
executing
a
search,
seizing
evidence
or
making
an
arrest.
that
would
be
the
pooler
type
of
rationale.
it
could
be
something
incident
to
that,
writing
a
report,
as
amicus
suggests.
it
could
be
other
things.
law
enforcement
officers
often
aren't
doing
the
very
things
that
we're
talking
about.
they
go
on
patrol,
they
talk
to
kids
in
schools.
there
are
all
types
of
things
that
law
enforcement
officers
might
do
that
don't
fall
within
what
might
thing
--
what
one
might
think
of
as
what,
you
know,
you
see
on
television
when
officers
are
making
contact
with
the
public
in
rather
high
stakes
incidents.
so
it's
difficult
both
because
we
have
a
state
law
term
that
varies
and
a
term
that
doesn't
even
appear
in
the
statute
and
that
we
don't
embrace.
so
again,
it's
difficult
to
provide
examples
in
any
definitive
way
because
both
of
the
comparators
shift
depending
on
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
believe,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
the
answer
is
yes,
but
let
me
qualify
that.
this
came
up
in
a
case
called
osborne
v.
haley.
and
the
question
about
scope
of
employment
for
purposes
of
the
westfall
act
turns
on
whether
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
incident
the
officer,
or
employee
in
many
cases,
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment.
now,
when
the
united
states
investigates,
this
is
authority
that
is
delegated
to
the
attorney
general,
which
is
in
turn
redelegated
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
offices,
investigates
the
relevant
circumstances
and
determines
that
the
allegations
are
just
false,
not
correct
at
all,
in
fact
it
never
happened,
the
employee
was
sitting
at
his
or
her
desk
beavering
away
at
important
federal
matters,
in
that
instance,
the
government
will
say
that
the
employee
was
in
fact
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment
and
can
explain
that
the
reason
for
that
is
the
government
rejects
the
underlying
factual
assertion.
that's
something
that
then
is
litigated
if
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
challenge
the
scope
determination.
and
the
court's
decision
in
osborne
explains
that
this
is
how
the
situation
will
play
out,
is
that
then
the
merits
of
the
case
ultimately
condense
into
a
challenge
to
the
scope
certification
of
the
attorney
general.
so,
no,
we
don't
simply
say
they
were
within
scope
for
no
reason.
we
determine
whether
they
were
within
scope
by
evaluating
the
circumstances
at
issue
and
if
the
alleged
circumstances
did
not
occur
and
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope
properly,
we
will
certify
that
the
employee
was
acting
within
the
scope.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
it
does.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
i
guess
there
are
two
elements
to
the
definition
of
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officer
within
the
statute.
first,
they
have
to
be
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
and
the
term
“
officer
”
when
we
are
talking
about
federal
officers,
the
dictionary
definition
that
most
commonly
and
comfortably
applies
here,
are
ones
that
we're
talking
about
like
sheriffs,
constables,
bailiffs,
people
who
have
normal
federal
criminal
law
enforcement
--
well,
not
federal
but
criminal
law
enforcement
responsibilities.
that
--
you
know,
when
you
back
out
to
the
second
criteria,
we
think
that
reinforces--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--customs
agents?
i
don't
know
if
they
have
criminal
--
i
believe
if
we
assume
that
they
are
simply
doing
a
civil
function,
custom
agents
would
not
fall
within
the
term
“
officer
”
as
normally
applied.
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
the
amicus
raises,
federal
forest
employees
--
forest
service
employees.
forest
service
employees,
the
clerks
that
work
in
d.c.
are
not
what
one
would
normally
think
of
as
an
officer,
particularly
when
we
are
talking
about
the
phrase
“
law
enforcement
officer
”.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
some,
some--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--actually,
i
don't
think
that
is--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
forest
service,
as
other
park
--
the
park
service,
has
different
roles
for
various
individuals
within
their
employ.
and
there
are,
in
fact,
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
park
service,
and
there
are
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
forest
service,
and
their
duties
are
what
one
would
traditionally
think
of
as
law
enforcement.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
that
is
correct.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
this
is
the
orsay
position,
which
is
not
the
pooler
position
i
believe
the
court
is
talking
about.
pooler,
the
government
has
not
taken
the
view
that
the
third
circuit
was
correct
and
pooler,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
except
within
the
third
circuit,
is
binding
precedent.
now,
when
we
take
a
step
back
and
abandon
pooler's
limited
approach
and
apply
a
more
amorphous
law
enforcement
capacity,
law
enforcement
authority,
the
government
has
done
that
in
a
number
of
lower
cases,
including
several
courts
of
appeals--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
think
in
those
cases
the
government
took
a
position
that
never
was
a
position
that
made
it
to
the
solicitor
general's
office.
and
when
we
took
this
--
both
in
the
reynolds
case
when
there
was
an
adverse
decision
to
the
united
states
and
in
this
case,
we
determined
that
the
position
was
not
one
that
could
be
--
was
not
correct
under
the
text.
and
i
think,
as
amicus's
--
amicus
does,
i
think,
a
valiant
job
of
trying
to
defend
that
position,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day,
there
simply
is
not
a
textual
argument
to
get
to
that
outcome.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
guess
there
is
a
few
parts
to
that
question.
on
the
statistics,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
statistics
that
we
would
be
able
to
reliably
extrapolate
to
see
what
this
would
mean.
i
think
there
may
well
be
some
additional
cases.
however,
there
are
other
tools,
as
we
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
including
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
which
requires
the
prisoners
both
pay
their
filing
fees
and
if
they
obtain
three
strikes,
must
in
fact
--
they
lose
ifp
status
and
must
pay
that
filing
fee
in
advance,
and
it's
a
substantial
amount
of
money
for
many
prisoners,
given
what
they
earn.
so
we
think
that
it's
not
a
reason
to
ignore
what
we
think
is
the
plain
text,
particularly
where
congress
here
has
in
the
proviso
specifically
referenced
section
1346(b).
section
1346(b)
makes
clear
that
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
applies
to
acts
or
omissions
committed
within
the
scope
of
employment.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
yes.
i
think--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
i
think
that
those
torts
serve
as
a
rough
approximation
of
what
congress
anticipated
would
be
the
areas
where
it
thought
the
united
states
should
be
liable,
when
we
are
talking
about
federal
law
enforcement
officers.
and
i
think
in
fact--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
not
--
i
don't
know
that
that
is
the
case,
justice
scalia.
certainly
there
is
some
correlation
between
those
torts
and
how
we
should,
for
instance,
understand
“
officer
of
the
united
states
”,
things
like
false
imprisonment,
false
arrest,
malicious
prosecution.
all
evoke
federal
criminal
law
employment
ideas.
however,
when
we
look
at
the
text
that
congress
used
to
implement
the
statute,
the
text
is
not
like
any
of
the
other
instances
within
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
where
congress
has
limited
the
waiver
to
particular
types
of
activities
or
carved
out
certain
activities.
in
fact,
what
congress
did
was
reference
back
to
the
general
waiver
provision
which
explains
that
the
waiver
applies
to
acts
within
the
scope
of
employment.
if
congress
had
wanted,
for
instance,
to
say
only
within
law
enforcement
capacity,
it
would
have
used
very
different
language.
the
language
of
sections
--
the
other
provisions
in
sections
2680,
for
instance,
subsections
(a),
(b),
and
(c),
which
limit
--
which
carve
out
the
execution
of
a
statute
or
regulation,
exercise
of
discretionary
functions,
the
laws
of
miscarriage
or
negligent
transmission
of
postal
matter,
assessment
or
collection
of
taxes
or
customs
duties,
(f)
specifically
directs
--
carves
out
the
imposition
or
establishment
of
a
quarantine,
(j)
carves
out
the
combatant
activities
of
military
forces.
if
congress
wanted
to
use
similar
language
like
law
enforcement
activities
of
a
law
enforcement
officer,
it
would
have
done
that.
and
the
united
states
--
i
don't
want
to
bang
the
drums
too
loudly
here.
we
did
take
a
contrary
position
previously,
but
when
our
office
reviewed
the
case,
we
simply
determined
that
the
position
could
not
be
one
that
would
square
to
the
test.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
yes
--
maybe
yes,
maybe
no.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
an
undefined
term
and
the
term
does
not
even
--
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
there
could
be
many
answers
to
that
question.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
you
could,
as
the
amicus
or
as
the
petitioner
suggests,
say
that
the
enforcement
of
a
criminal
sentence
is
part
of
law
enforcement
capacity,
so
anything
that
they
do
is
law
enforcement.
you
could
think
of
law
enforcement
capacity
as
more
like
arrests,
you
know,
searches
for
violations
of
federal
criminal
law,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
those
might
be
exercises
that
the
court
would
have
to
engage
in
if
congress
had
actually
used
text
directing
the
court
to
look
at
that.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
thank
you.
