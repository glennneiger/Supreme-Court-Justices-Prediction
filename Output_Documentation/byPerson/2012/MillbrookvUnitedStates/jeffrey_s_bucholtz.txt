mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
hope
to
convince
the
court
of
two
things
today.
first
is
about
our
reading
of
the
law
enforcement
proviso
as
limited
to
conduct
of
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officers
acting
as
such.
the
first
is
that
that
reading
is
textually
plausible.
it
is
a
reasonable
reading
of
what
congress
enacted
in
light
of
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
in
light
of
ordinary
english
usage.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
not
really
clear
how
different
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
are
from
each
other,
because
there
haven't
been
cases
that
have
arisen
that
have
really
tested
the
proposition
that
the
third
circuit
meant
only,
literally
only,
the
execution
of
a
search,
the
seizure
of
evidence,
or
the
making
of
an
arrest,
and
that
would
exclude
conduct
very
closely
incident
to
one
of
those
things.
those
cases
just
haven't
arisen.
so
the
courts
have
used
different
formulations.
they
appear
to
mean
slightly
different
things
by
them,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
exaggerate
the
differences
between
the
third
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit.
both
are
trying
to
capture
what
congress
was
getting
at
here,
which
was
the
law
enforcement
proviso
was
about
law
enforcement
activity.
it
was
about
covering
the
united
states
under
the
ftca
for
abuses
of
law
enforcement
authority
like
had
occurred
in
collinsville,
which
was
the
national
scandal
that
prompted
the
enactment
of
the
proviso.
so
i
think
the
answer
to,
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question,
is:
we
think
that
if
you
take
the
third
circuit's
language
in
pooler,
which
of
course
is
not
this
case,
but
if
you
take
the
pooler
language
literally
and
you
say
that
the
only
conduct
covered
is
conduct
in
the
course
of
--
that's
language
the
court
used
a
few
times
in
pooler
--
in
the
course
of
a
search,
an
arrest,
or
a
seizure
of
evidence,
that's
problematic
because
it's
clear
that
congress
was
trying
to
cover
abuses
of
law
enforcement
authority,
including
malicious
prosecution
and
abuse
of
process,
which
we
know
because
congress
included
those
torts
in
the
exception
to
the
exception.
and
if
you
had
a
situation
where
an
officer
conducted
a
search
and
then
wrote
a
false
report
about
the
search
that
he
had
conducted,
the
writing
of
the
report
wouldn't
literally
be
in
the
course
of
the
search.
so
if
you
take
those
words
in
pooler
literally,
that
would
be
excluded.
that
can't
be
right.
so
to
that
extent
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
position
rather
than
the
third
circuit
position.
but
again
i'm
not
really
sure
that
it's
fair
to
attribute
that
extreme
position
to
the
third
circuit.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
it's
a
substitution.
i
think
it's
an
addition
if
it's
anything.
but
really
the
reason
is
that
under
ordinary
english
usage,
when
there's
a
reference
to
somebody
defined
by
their
status,
it's
fair
to
assume
that
the
reference
to
the
person
defined
by
their
status
is
really
just
intended
to
cover
things
they
do
in
that
relevant
status
and
not
things
they
do
in
some
other
capacity.
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
here
is
exactly
what
the
court
did
in
lane
v.
pena.
in
lane
v.
pena,
the
statute
at
issue
was
the
rehabilitation
act.
it
waived
sovereign
immunity
and
provided
a
damages
remedy
against
federal
providers
of
funding.
the
department
of
transportation
clearly
was
a
federal
provider
of
funding.
it
gave
out
all
sorts
of
funding
to
all
sorts
of
recipients.
but
that's
not
what
the
case
was
about.
the
case
was
about
the
merchant
marine
academy
and
somebody
who
was
dismissed
from
it.
and
what
the
court
said
is
the
reference
to
federal
funding
providers
like
the
department
of
transportation
had
to
be
read
as
limited
to
federal
funding
providers
acting
as
such.
those
were
the
court's
words,
“
acting
as
such
”.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
justice
kennedy,
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
proviso,
the
operative
provision,
congress
referred
to
acts
or
omissions
of
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officers
of
the
united
states.
congress
didn't
say
any
acts
or
omissions
of
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officers
were
covered.
it
didn't
say
all
were
covered.
it
just
said
acts
or
omissions
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
same
way
that
the
statute
at
issue
in
lane
referred
to
conduct
of
a
federal
funding
provider.
and
so
what
this
court
should
do,
we
submit,
is
construe
acts
or
omissions
of
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officers
of
the
united
states
as
limited
to
acts
or
omissions
of
those
defined
--
that
defined
class
of
persons
in
the
relevant
capacity,
when
they're
acting
as
law
enforcement
officers.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
congress
didn't,
in
the
proviso,
justice
kagan,
congress
did
not
actually
use
the
phrase
“
scope
of
employment
”.
it
did
not
actually
incorporate
scope
of
employment
as
a
limitation
explicitly
in
the
proviso.
it
--
it
incorporated
1346(b),
which
contains
the
scope
requirement.
but
the
proviso
--
in
the
proviso,
congress
did
not
actually
speak
in
terms
of
scope
of
employment
as
the
operative
limitation.
so
i
don't
think
we'd
be
substituting
the
acting
as
such
limitation
for
anything
that
actually
appears
in
the
proviso.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
justice
ginsburg,
we
certainly
agree
that
--
that
the
conduct
that's
covered
has
to
be
within
the
scope
of
the
federal
officer's
employment.
the
only
point
i
was
trying
to
make
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
justice
kagan
is
that
requirement
exists
in
1346,
not
in
the
proviso
by
its
terms.
we
certainly
agree
with
that,
and
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
one
way
the
court
could
affirm
the
judgment
below
is
to
hold
that
the
officers
here
were
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment,
taking
the
allegations
as
true,
as
they
have
to
be
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
but
to
return
to
justice
kagan,
to
your
question
about
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
--
the
court
to
--
to
interpret
"acts
or
omissions
of
law
enforcement
officers.
"
as
acting
as
such,
it's
because
--
in
part
the
answer
is
because
scope
turns
on
state
law.
so
congress
doesn't
know
when
it
enacts
the
proviso
what's
going
to
be
covered
if
the
only
limitation
is
scope,
because
that
turns
on
50
different
states'
laws.
and
--
and
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
are
actual
meaningful
differences
between
different
states'
laws
as
to
scope
as
we
--
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief.
but
the
other
past
of
the
answer
is
the
--
is
the
second
part
of
this
court's
analysis
in
lane
v.
pena,
which
is
it's
entirely
possible
literally
to
read
the
rehabilitation
act
in
lane,
and
i
would
grant
that
it's
possible
literally
to
read
the
words
in
the
proviso,
as
covering
everything
that
a
defined
law
enforcement
officer
does
within
the
scope
of
employment.
but
the
court
said
in
lane:
we
can't
read
the
statute
that
way,
because
we're
talking
about
a
waiver
of
immunity,
and
waivers
of
immunity,
even
if
you
don't
have
to
put
a
heavy
thumb
on
the
scales
and
even
if
you
don't
have
to
require
that
it
be
unequivocal
--
we're
not
going
that
far
here
--
you
can't
interpret
it
more
broadly
than
there's
any
reason
to
think
congress
meant.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
there
may
be
certain
types
of
law
enforcement
officers,
justice
breyer,
who
generally
aren't
engaged
in
law
enforcement
activity
when
they're
within
the
scope
of
employment.
but
that's
not
the
case
with
respect
to
correctional
officers
like
are
at
issue
here.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
and
the
reason
for
that
is
--
and
other
types
of
officers,
which
hopefully
i'll
be
able
to
get
to,
but
correctional
officers
first
since
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
18
u.s.c.
3050
is
what
makes
correctional
officers
fall
within
the
second
sentence
of
the
proviso,
the
definition
that
congress
provided
of
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officers.
it's
what
gives
them
the
authority
to
execute--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--that's
right,
because
he
meets
the
status-based
definition
that
congress
provided,
but
there's
no
reason
to
think
congress
intended
that
he
be
covered
when
he's
not
engaged
in
law
enforcement
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
because
the
correctional
officer
essentially
has
two
capacities.
18
u.s.c.
3050,
which
is
the
only
source
of
law
that
anyone
has
pointed
to,
to
make
correctional
officers
fall
within
the
definition
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
first
place,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
correctional
officers'
daily
interaction
with
already
incarcerated
prisoners.
it
authorizes
correctional
officers
to
arrest
escaped
inmates
and
to
arrest
visitors
to
prisons.
it
has
no
application
to
their
daily
interaction
with
prisoners
who
are
already
incarcerated.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
justice
ginsburg,
correctional
officers
do
search
prisoners'
cells
on
a
routine
basis
as
part
of
their
duty
to
maintain
order
and
security
within
the
prisons.
that
responsibility
comes
not
from
18
u.s.c.
3050,
but
from
18
u.s.c.
4001
and
following,
which
is
an
entirely
different
set
of
legal
authorities
that
has
to
do
with
the
attorney
general's
management
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
under
his
supervision
and
correctional
officers
--
and
28
c.f.r.
part
552,
which
is
where
the
correctional
officers
get
their
authority
from
to
search
prisoner
cells,
et
cetera.
we
think
that
when
--
when
correctional
officers
are
engaged
in
that
kind
of
activity,
they're
acting
in
a
security
capacity
to
maintain
order
and
security
within
the
prison.
they're
not
acting
in
their
very
narrow
law
enforcement
capacity
conferred
by
18
u.s.c.
3050.
this
case
doesn't
have--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
as
i
said
before,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
there
are
certain
types
of
law
enforcement
officers
who
generally
when
they're
acting
within
the
scope
of
employment
are
engaged
in
law
enforcement
activity.
and
deputy
u.s.
marshals
would
probably
fall
within
that.
but
the
important
point
about
this
case
is
it
doesn't,
justice
ginsburg,
involve
an
allegation
about
a
search.
so
whatever
the
court
might
think
the
right
way
to
look
at
correctional
officers
when
they're
engaged
in
searches
might
be,
this
case
isn't
about
a
search.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
the
law
is
already--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--justice
breyer,
i
think
we
can
tell
from
the
definition
in
the
proviso
what
congress
was
focused
on
when
it
--
when
it
referred
to
law
enforcement
officers.
we
can
tell
what
congress--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--and
--
and
--
and
other
conduct
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--i
used
before
is
yes,
with
the
caveat,
and
i
think
it's
an
important
one,
that
it's
not
just
those
three
things,
only
what
occurs
in
the
course
of
those
three
things
the
way
pooler
could
possibly
be
read,
but
also
conduct
that's
closely
incident
to
those
things.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
it
depends,
justice
scalia,
it
depends--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
the
person
who
writes
the
letter
may
qualify
as
a
law
enforcement
officer
under
the
definition,
but
that's
a
different
question,
i
would
submit,
than
whether
that
--
whether
that
act
constitutes
law
enforcement
activity.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
scalia,
is
probably
no,
but
the
important
follow-up
is
if
that
person
meets
the
definition
of
law
enforcement
officer
because
he's
an
epa
agent,
and
after
the
letter
he
follows
up
and
goes
to
the
premises
of
the
recipient
of
the
letter,
knocks
down
the
door
and
conducts
an
illegal
search,
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
cover.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
if
it's
an
fbi
agent?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
justice
breyer,
the
answer
--
the
answer
--
well,
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
find
an
analogy
to
an
ordinary
policeman--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--sure.
and
when
they
are
engaged
in
patrols,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that's
probably
law
enforcement
activity--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--then
maybe
i
should
try
to
return
to
some
of
the
examples
that
other
justices
have
given.
so
there
was
talk
earlier
about
an
osha
inspector.
the
government's
position
--
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
difference
between
our
position
and
the
government's
--
the
government
would
say
that
because
osha
isn't
a
criminal
law
in
the
traditional
sense
and
an
osha
inspector
or
an
osha
agent
isn't
enforcing
criminal
law
in
the
colloquial
sense,
that
that
shouldn't
be
covered.
but
if
the
osha
inspector
knocks
down
your
door
and
conducts
an
illegal
search
and
batters
you,
why
shouldn't
that
be
covered?
we
know
that's
a
law
enforcement
abuse,
and
we
know
that
law
enforcement
abuse
is
exactly
what
congress
is
trying
to
get
at.
the
government,
it's
like
it's
trying
to
relitigate
marshall
against
barlows
where
this
court
held
that
osha
inspectors
have
to
have
a
warrant
even
though
you
could
think
of
osha
as
being
administrative
or
civil
as
opposed
to
criminal.
that's
the
argument
that
the
government
made
there
a
generation
ago
and
they
lost.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
because,
justice
kennedy,
the
point
in
this
case
is
that
we
agree
that
correctional
officers
fall
within
the
plain
language
of
the
definition
that
congress
provided.
again,
the
structure
of
the
proviso
is
there
are
two
sentences,
an
operative
provision
and
the
definition.
we
are
trying
to
get
the
court
to
construe
the
operative
provision,
the
first
sentence,
in
the
same
way
the
court
did
in
lane
against
pena.
the
government
is
trying
to
get
the
court
to
construe
the
definition,
the
second
sentence.
what
congress
said
in
the
definition,
what
the
term
means,
the
court
has
much
less
scope
to
construe
that
in
some
way
other
than
the
literal
language
that
congress
provided
where
congress
said
what
the
term
means.
so
we
agree
under
the
plain
language
of
the
definition
that
correctional
officers
are
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officers
because
of
18
u.s.c.
3050,
which
gives
them
the
power
under
limited,
and
inapplicable
here,
circumstances
to
arrest.
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
correctional
officers
under
18
u.s.c.
3050
or
under
the
different
authorities
under
18
u.s.c.
4001
and
following
and
the
regulations,
that
they
wear
two
hats.
sometimes
they
act
in
a
law
enforcement
capacity,
but
not
usually,
because
that
only
applies
in
the
narrow
context
of
escapes
or
visitors.
when
they
are
dealing
with
already
incarcerated
prisoners,
like
in
the
allegations
here,
they
are
really
not
acting
in
that
capacity
at
all.
they
are
wearing
a
different
hat.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
justice
scalia,
you
have
absolutely
perfectly
encapsulated
our
position.
thank
you.
[laughter]
the
reason
why
we
think
that
that
difference
between
our
position
and
the
government's
is
important
is
that
the
government's
position
would
render
the
proviso
severely
underinclusive.
we
know
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
law
enforcement
abuses
and
provide
a
remedy.
and
congress
--
the
government
would
say
that
if
it's
not
a
traditional
law
enforcement
officer
in
the
colloquial
sense
of
like
a
constable,
that
it's
not
covered.
but
all
sorts
of
agents
of
the
united
states
from
osha
to
fda
to
all
sorts
of
other
agencies,
to
epa,
engage
in
law
enforcement
activity
like
the
three
things
we
know
congress
was
focused
like
a
laser
beam
on:
executing
searches,
seizing
evidence,
making
arrests
for
violations
of
federal
law.
and
i
don't
see
any
basis
consistent
with
the
text
or
our
understanding
of
what
congress
intended,
to
the
extent
it's
different
from
the
text,
to
say
that
that's
not
covered.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
that's
part
of
it,
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
two
parts
to
the
answer,
justice
sotomayor.
the
first
is
the
government
is
trying
to
give
the
first
sentence
the
broader
reading,
which
it
recognizes
then
creates
a
problem
that
it
tries
to
solve
by
narrowing
the
second
sentence
in
a
way
that
we
think
won't
hold.
but
the
other
part
of
the
answer,
justice
sotomayor,
is
it's
about
congressional
intent.
justice
kennedy
asked
earlier
about
whether
the
government's
interpretation
or
the
petitioner's
interpretation
would
unleash
a
flood
of
suits
by
prisoners
and
whether
it's
fair
to
think
that
congress
would
have
intended
that.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
proviso,
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
that
anyone
in
congress
contemplated
that
the
proviso
would
or
could
or
should
apply
in
the
prison
situation.
all
congress
was
focused
on
was
providing
a
remedy
for
the
kinds
of
raids
that
had
occurred
in
collinsville.
and
so
i
think
when
somebody
has
two
hats,
like
a
prison
guard
has,
because,
again,
there
is
two
different
sources
of
legal
authority
that
they
are
exercising,
18
u.s.c.
3050
versus
4001,
or
a
military
policeman
who
has
two
hats,
in
the
cases
of
holian
that
we
describe
in
our
briefs
where
the
government
made
the
argument
that
where
a
military
policeman
is
engaged
in
a
military
function,
not
a
law
enforcement
function,
that
they
are
not
covered.
we
think
where
somebody
who
meets
the
definition
that
congress
provided
of
an
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officer
has
two
distinct
hats,
two
distinct
capacities.
when
they
are
not
acting
in
the
law
enforcement
one,
they
are
not
covered.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
intended
that
military
police
or
prison
guards
be
covered
when
they
are
maintaining
order
on
a
military
base
or
within
a
prison.
that's
not
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at.
and
we
think
again
a
severe
disadvantage
of
the
government's
position,
they
are
trying
to
solve
--
in
a
sense
they
are
trying
to
solve
the
same
problem
that
we
are
with
our
acting
as
such
interpretation,
but
they
are
trying
to
solve
it
through
the
wrong
part
of
the
statute
and
in
a
way
that
--
in
a
way
ends
up
with
the
worst
of
both
worlds.
you
end
up
with
broader
coverage
of
the
kind
of
conduct
that's
covered,
broader
than
there
is
any
reason
to
think
congress
intended,
conduct
that
doesn't
involve
law
enforcement
activity
at
all,
but
a
narrower
class
of
people
whose
conduct
is
covered.
where
that
excludes
people
like
osha
inspectors,
fda
agents,
epa
agents
and
in
the
rare
circumstance
where
the
forest
service
employee
is
acting
as
a
law
enforcement
officer
rather
than
as
a
botanist
or
an
entomologist
or
something
like
that,
we
think
congress
intended
to
cover
them.
we
know
from
the
definition
that
there
were
three
exercises
of
law
enforcement
authority
that
congress
was
focused
like
a
laser
beam
on:
executing
searches,
seizing
evidence
and
making
arrests.
where
somebody
meets
the
definition
of
law
enforcement
officer
and
they
are
doing
one
of
those
three
things,
there
is
no
basis
not
to
say
that
they
are
covered.
we
think
it's
better
to
interpret
the
first
sentence
of
the
proviso
the
same
way
the
court
did
in
lane
against
pena
as
limited
to
acts
or
omissions
of
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officers
acting
as
such,
and
keep
the
definition
that
congress
provided
the
way
congress
provided
it.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
not
surpluses
necessarily,
justice
ginsburg,
because
it
varies
among
states.
there
could
be
states
where
scope
is
narrower
or
broader,
and
there
could
always
be
situations
where
state
law
is
such
that
the
easiest
way
to
resolve
a
case
is
under
scope,
and
not
under
the
concept
of
acting
as
a
law
enforcement
officer.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
if
an
officer
is
executing
a
search
but
he's
doing
so
because
of
a
personal
vendetta
against
the
person
whose
premises
he's
searching,
and
he's
--
and
he's
not
--
under
whatever
the
state
--
state's
law
that
is
applicable,
if
there
is
a
relatively
narrow
conception
of
scope
so
that
you
have
to
be
trying
to
serve
your
employer,
which
is
the
traditional
rule,
and
not
just
sort
of
on
the
job
in
a
loose
sense,
which
is
what
the
d.c.
rule
has
come
to
be,
an
officer
who
is
engaged
in
a
search
or
making
--
making
an
arrest
for
a
completely
inappropriate
reason,
not
trying
to
serve
the
employer,
not
in
any
way
that's
authorized
by
the
employer,
might
not
be
within
the
scope,
but
might
be
engaged
in
one
of
the
three
law
enforcement
activities
that
congress
specified.
and
the
other--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--no,
justice
kennedy,
it's
not
an
arrest,
for,
among
other
reasons,
the
reason
that
prison
guards
don't
have
any
legal
authority
to
make
an
arrest
in
that
circumstance.
the
prisoner's
already
been
arrested.
that's
how
he
got
to
jail
in
the
first
place.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
yes.
and
28
cfr
part
552
sets
out
the
authorities
that
prison
guards
have
to
enforce
prison
regulations
to
maintain
security
and
order
within
the
prison,
like
in
that
circumstance.
that's
not
making
an
arrest.
the
prison
guards
have
the
authority--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
that
--
that
may
involve
the
use
of
force
and
i
--
you
know,
you
can
make
an
argument
that
--
that
when
you
pick
somebody
up
like
in
your
hypothetical,
that
that's
like
an
arrest
at
common
law.
there's
no
reason
to
think
congress
was
getting
at
that,
was
trying
to
cover
that
in
the
proviso.
where
somebody
has
two
different
distinct
capacities
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
way
bureau
of
prisons
guards
do,
and
they're
acting
in
the
one
and
not
the
other,
then
i
think
that's
the
simple
answer,
is
that--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--justice
sotomayor,
the
hypothetical
is--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--are
you
talking
about
a
bureau
of
prison
guard
filing
the
arrest
complaint?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
i
think
--
one
thing
to
point
out
is
the
government
informs
the
court
in
its
reply
brief
that
in
a
situation
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
prison
rules
that
may
also
be
a
violation
of
federal
law
that
may
also
be
a
crime,
such
that,
you
know,
in
ordinary
english
usage,
you
could
refer
to
the
prison
guard
as
conducting
an
investigation
for
violation
of
a
federal
crime.
what
happens
is
the
bop
guards
don't
do
that
themselves.
they
call
in
the
fbi.
that's
what
the
government
says
in
its
reply
brief.
so
i
think
that
itself
is
an
indication
of
the
distinction
between
prison
guards
who
are
law
enforcement
officers
as
congress
has
defined
the
term,
but
who
are
not
traditional
law
enforcement
officers,
as
the
government
seeks
to
define
--
redefine
the
term,
and
in
that
capacity
are
not
acting
as
law
enforcement
officers.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
well,
justice
kagan,
it's
hard
to
give
a
simple
comprehensive
answer
that
applies
to
all
different
types
of
law
enforcement
officers.
let
me
start
by
saying
that
the
three
things
that
have
to
be
included
are
the
three
things
that
congress
specified,
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
the
government's
definition,
is
that
it
reads
out
cases
involves
those
three
activities,
involving,
in
the
government's
view
--
kinds
of
officers.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
so
--
in
a
case
that
involves
one
of
those
three
things
but
also
something
else
that's
incident
to
or
related
to
those
three
things,
we
think
it
would
probably
be
artificial.
and
you
can
imagine
all
sorts
of
hypos,
but
it
might
well
be
artificial
to
separate
the
writing
of
the
--
of
the
report
about
the
arrest
and
the
arrest
itself.
so
conduct
incident
to
one
of
these
three
specified
activities
we
think
is
probably
covered.
we
also
think
that
maybe
when
you
are
talking
about
a
type
of
law
enforcement
officer
like
an
fbi
agent
who
is
wearing
his
law
enforcement
hat
all
the
time,
doesn't
have
a
second
distinct
capacity
as
a
matter
of
law,
like
a
military
policeman
or
correctional
officer,
that
maybe
a
broader
definition
is
appropriate,
that
maybe
the
fbi
agent
who
is--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
--well,
i
mean,
justice
kagan,
in
fairness,
this
case
doesn't
present
that
question,
because
it
doesn't
involve
any
law
enforcement
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
of
course.
and
where
i
think
it
would
be
taking
the
court
is
that
as
always,
there
could
be
hard
cases
that
could
arise
that
the
lower
courts
would
have
to
grapple
with,
but
i
think
the
important
concept
is,
that
where
somebody
has
two
hats,
a
law
enforcement
capacity
and
some
other
capacity,
then
it's
easy
to
draw
that
line,
in
concept.
again,
there
could
be
hard
cases,
but
as
a
concept,
it's
easy
to
draw
that
line.
where
somebody
doesn't
have
two
hats,
they
only
have
one
hat,
like
an
fbi
agent,
and
they
are
on
the
job
and
they
are
engaged
in
what
normal
people
would
think
of
as
law
enforcement
activity,
maybe
that's
covered.
i
don't
really
have
a
--
have
a
problem
with
that.
i
think
--
i
think
that's
probably
consistent
with
what
congress
was
getting
at.
and
maybe
the
way
to
think
about
it
is,
congress
defined
“
law
enforcement
officer
”
with
reference
to
the
three
specified
kinds
of
exercises
of
law
enforcement
authority,
but
when
the
fbi
agent
is
interviewing
a
witness
or
potential
suspect
but
hasn't
yet
gotten
to
the
point
of
arresting
a
person
or
conducting
a
search,
you
can
think
of
that
as
preliminary
to
an
exercise
of
one
of
the
three
specified
authorities,
because
after
all,
that's
what
the
fbi
agent
has
the
authority
to
do,
it's
what
his
job
entails.
and
depending
on
how
the
initial
questioning
goes,
that
might
be
the
next
step.
and
so
it's
never
far
from
the
scene,
when
an
fbi
agent
is
engaged
in
what
you
would
normally
think
of
as
law
enforcement
activity,
that
one
of
the
three
specified
law
enforcement
activities
could
be
in
the
offing.
that's
very
different
when
you're
talking
about
forest
service
employees
who
technically
meet
the
definition
but
usually
are
not
doing
anything
within
a
million
miles
of
what
normal
people
would
think
of
as
law
enforcement
activity.
so
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
different
kinds
of
people
who
fall
within
the
definition.
and
--
i
understand
the
court
wants
to
try
to
figure
out
what
the
implications
of
this
interpretation
would
be.
i
think
that
in
the
prison
context,
the
answer
is
clear,
because
there
are
two
distinct
capacities.
and
that's
a
hugely
important
context
as
a
practical
matter,
given
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
made
about
the
likelihood
of
an
enormous
number
of
claims
that
congress
probably
didn't
intend.
in
the
military
police
context,
where
there
are
also
two
distinct
capacities,
it's
probably
pretty
easy
to
draw
the
line.
in
other
cases,
it
will
be
case-by-case
whether
something
that
the
plaintiff
alleges
should
be
thought
of
as
law
enforcement
activity
or
law
enforcement
officer
acting
as
such.
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
the
broad
interpretation
of
law
enforcement
activity
acting
as
such,
dealing
with
the
traditional
law
enforcement
officer
in
a
context
that
it's
clear
congress
intended.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
bucholtz
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
