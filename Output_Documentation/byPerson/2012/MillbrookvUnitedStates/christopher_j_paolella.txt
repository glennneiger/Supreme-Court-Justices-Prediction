mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plain
language
of
section
2680(h)
is
law
enforcement
provides
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
clear,
precise
and
unambiguous
terms.
it
extends
the
waiver
to
any
claim
for
one
of
the
six
enumerated
torts
committed
by
a
federal
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officer
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment.
and
it
defines
investigative
or
law
enforcement
officer
as
any
officer
of
the
united
states
who
is
quote,
“
empowered
by
law
”,
unquote,
to
carry
out
searches,
seizures
or
arrests.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
the
proviso
doesn't
any
employee
of
the
united
states
who
is
authorized
to
carry
out
a
search,
seizure,
or
arrest.
it
used
the
term
"any
officer
of
the
united
states.
"
and
i
believe
that
the
term
“
officer
”
carries
some
water
here.
if
we
look
at
a
spectrum
of
individuals
who
have
powers
--
for
example,
to
carry
out
searches
--
we
can
envision
on
the
one
hand
very
traditional
core
of
law
enforcement
officers.
let's
take
a
dea
officer
who
can
carry
out
arrests,
do
searches
and
seizures,
is
authorized
to
use
force.
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
we
have
something
like
a
meat
inspector
or
an
osha
inspector,
who
may
have
a
limited
ability
to
carry
out
searches,
but
these
are
searches
that
are
in
really
a
law
enforcement
capacity
--
an
administrative
capacity
as
opposed
to
a
core
law
enforcement
capacity.
so
the
government
raises
the
argument,
and
we
think
it's
a
plausible
interpretation,
that
by
using
the
term
“
officer
”
rather
than
any
employee
of
the
united
states,
that
there
was
some
limiting
factor
imported
into
the
statute,
thereby
the
statute's
plain
language.
and
i
would
trust
my
colleague
from
the
solicitor
general's
office
to
map
the
boundaries
of
that.
i
would
say
that
in
any
case,
a
correctional
officer,
who
are
the
individuals
who
are
involved
here
in
committing
the
complained-of
acts,
certainly
falls
much
closer
to
core
law
enforcement
on
that
spectrum
than
to
the
administrative
side.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
the
--
yes.
in
many
states
that
use
the
term
“
peace
officer
”
in
the
statutes
defining
a
peace
officer
for
things
--
for
example,
authorizing
the
use
of
force
or
authorizing
the
carriage
of
weapons
--
many
states
--
it's
not
uniform,
but
many
states
include
correctional
officers
within
that
ambit.
the
federal
government
typically
does
not
use
the
term
“
peace
officer
”
in
its
statutes,
but
if
you
look
at
federal
statutes
that
use
the
term
“
law
enforcement
officer
”,
which
is
the
very
term
that's
used
in
subsection
(h),
many
--
many
of
those
other
statutory
schemes
expressly
include
correctional
officers.
so,
for
example,
for
purposes
of
civil
service
pay,
for
purposes
of
death
benefits,
of
retirement
benefits.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
i
would
think
in
the
context
of
the
prison,
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
a
prison
guard
could
exercise
any
more
authority
than
they
do.
in
addition
to
their
correctional
function,
prison
correctional
officers
are
essentially
the
police
force
for
the
prison.
they
are
charged
with
maintaining
order,
and
they're
charged
with
enforcing
the
laws
of
the
united
states
within
the
confines
of
the
prison,
and
indeed
in
some
specified
cases,
outside
the
prison
walls.
for
example,
they
are
explicitly
authorized
under
section
3050
of
title
18
of
the
u.s.
code
not
just
to
carry
out
arrests
in
prison
for
violations
of
federal
law,
both
by
prisoners
and
visitors,
but
to
carry
out
arrests
outside
the
prison
walls
to
prevent
prisoner
escapes
or
to
prevent
assaults
on
other
law
enforcement
officers.
so
there's
quite
expressly
an
arrest
authority
granted
to
correctional
officers.
in
addition,
they
have
the
power
to
search
for
contraband,
both
in
the
context
of
visitors
to
prison
and
prisoners
themselves.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
justice
sotomayor,
let
me
begin
answering
that
question
by
making
a
distinction
which
i
think
is
an
important
distinction
here,
between
the
definition
of
status
and
the
definition
of
the
conduct
that's
implied
here.
because
i
think
this
is
a
crucial
difference
between
the
amicus's
argument
on
one
hand
and
the
solicitor
general's
office
on
the
other
hand.
the
amicus
would
limit
the
type
of
conduct
that's
covered
by
the
statute.
they
would
limit
it
to
actions
that
occur
in
a
law
enforcement
capacity.
so
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
that
means.
i
think
that
gets
passed
along
with--
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
--or
some
other
similar
activities,
which,
again,
i'm
not
sure
addresses
the
topic--
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
the
problem
with
their
position
is
--
with
the
amicus--
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
--the
problem
with
amicus's
requirement
is
that
it
has
no
textual
basis
in
the
statute.
the
statute
is
very
precise.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
well,
your
honor--
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
--i
think
that
that
is
a
limiting
factor
that
is
not
just
implicit
but
explicit
in
the
statutory
text.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
well,
the
fact
that
congress
was
so
explicit
about
categorizing
precisely
the
kind
of
torts
that
are
covered
here
--
that
sort
of
conduct
--
and
the
fact
that
congress
was
so
precise
about
cross-referencing
section
1346(b),
which
incorporates
of
the
scope
of
employment
requirement,
suggests
to
me
that
when
congress
wanted
to
confine
the
capacity
in
which
the
acts
occurred,
it
could
do
so,
and
it
did
in
fact
do
so.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
that
was
the
policy
judgment
that
congress
made,
that
it
would
not--
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
--that
it
didn't
think
that
those
sorts
of
torts
in
this
context
--
and
i
think
we
all
agree
this
is
a
law
enforcement-oriented
provision.
it's
called
the
law
enforcement
proviso.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
from
that
we
ought
to
draw
an
entirely
extra-textual
additional
limitation
that
goes
beyond
the
specific
line
that
congress
did,
in
fact,
draw
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
of
scope
of
employment
was
something
that
was
conceded
below.
it
was
never
litigated.
it
was
never
briefed
before
the
respondents'
brief.
and
from
my
reading
of
the
question
presented
as
this
court
formulated
it,
it
was
excluded
from
the
question
presented.
so
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
address
it.
it's
more
properly
addressed
on
remand
if
it's
important.
but
here
i
think
that
there
is
an
argument
that's
within
the
scope
of
employment.
and
if
you
look
at
cases,
for
example
the
mary
m.
case
out
of
the
california
supreme
court,
there
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
a
sexual
assault
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
of
an
individual
who
was
subject
to
that
officer's
authority
could
be
held
to
be
within
the
scope
of
employment,
because
an
officer
is
vested
with
authority
and
it
is
reasonably
foreseeable
that
that
authority
can
sometimes
be
abused
if
it
happens
when
the
officer
is
in
uniform,
on
job
hours,
dealing
with
someone
who
that
individual
is
authorized
to
use
appropriate
force
against.
and
even
in
pennsylvania,
you
see
cases
where
people
do
outrageous
things,
like
a
private
detective
shooting
a
picketing
protester,
where
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
held
that
that's
within
the
scope
of
employment.
it's
a
complicated
issue.
it's
an
issue
of
state
law
and
it
will
be
different
in
every
state,
which
is
why
i
would
suggest
it's
more
appropriate
for
this
to
be
handled
on
remand
rather
than
have
a
ruling
by
this
court
on
a
narrow
issue
of
pennsylvania
state
law.
but
i
think
it
is
hardly
implausible
that
pennsylvania
courts
would
find
this
within
the
scope
of
employment.
your
honor,
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
begin
by
addressing
justice
kennedy's
point,
his
question
regarding
the
possibility
of
a
flood
of
lawsuits
from
prisoners.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
right
now,
pooler
and
orsay
are
the
minority
rules.
most
federal
courts
have
adopted
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
law
enforcement
proviso.
so
if
adopting
a
broader
interpretation
here
would
open
the
flood
gates,
the
flood
gates
are
already
open,
and
they
have
been
for
40
years
in
most
of
the
country.
and
we
haven't
seen
a
flood
of
ftca
suits
brought
by
prisoners,
especially
since
the
passage
of
the
plra--
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
--i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
issue
has
really
been
litigated
in
the
federal
courts.
it
simply
hasn't
come
up.
and
i
think
that
that's
an
indication
that
it's
--
it's
a
workable
test.
it's
--
it's
not
something
--
that
there
are
many,
many
cases,
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
involve
individuals
who
will
be
by
any
reasonable
definition
core
law
enforcement
officers.
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
every
federal
court
to
address
the
issue
has
defined
correctional
officers
as
law
enforcement
officers.
you
know
--
as
officers,
as
that
term
is
used.
so
i
think
that
these
things
are
really
ultimately
noncontroversial.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
i
think
that
the
word
“
officer
”
carries
some
water
in
this
statute,
and
it
means
something
other
than
“
employee
”.
mr.
christopher
j.
paolella
yes.
justice
scalia,
let
me
return
to
your
earlier
point
about
inferring
congressional
intent
from,
for
example,
from
the
list
of
enumerated
torts.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
best
evidence
of
congress's
intent
is
the
text
of
the
statute.
and
the
fundamental
problem
with
amicus's
position
is
that
he
very
ably
uses
tools
for
construing
ambiguous
statutes
to
construe
a
statute
that
at
its
core
is
not
ambiguous,
it's
precise
and
it's
definite.
now,
the
coverage
that
is
created
by
the
literal
words
of
the
statute
may
be
debatable
as
a
policy
matter.
maybe
it
makes
sense
to
include
correctional
officers,
maybe
it
doesn't.
but
it's
not
absurd.
and
this
court's
rule
is
when
you
were
construing
a
non-ambiguous
statute,
congress
gets
to
draw
that
policy
line,
not
the
court,
as
long
as
the
result
is
not
absurd.
and
we
would
argue
that
congress
drew
that
policy
line
here.
it
very
specifically
provided
that
any
claim
based
on
enumerated
tort
by
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
employment,
is
where
it
drew
that
line,
that's
what
the
statute
literally
says.
there
is
no
argument
about
that.
and
i
think
that
all
of
the
results,
the
parade
of
horribles
that
amicus
has
raised,
again,
may
be
debatable
as
a
policy
matter,
but
not
one
of
them
is
an
absurd
exercise
of
congress's
responsibility.
and
as
a
result,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse.
