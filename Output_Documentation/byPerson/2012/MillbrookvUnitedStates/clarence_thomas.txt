justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
ftca
waives
the
federal
government
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
for
various
tort
claims.
petitioner
kim
millbrook,
a
federal
prisoner
filed
a
suit
under
the
ftca
alleging
that
prison
officials
sexually
assaulted
and
battered
him.
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
arguing
that
millbrook
could
not
be
cover
because
section
26
(a)
(d)
(h)
of
the
ftca,
known
as
the
“intentional
tort
exception”
preserves
the
united
states
sovereign
immunity
from
claims
for
intentional
torts.
millbrook
argued
that
the
intentional
tort
exception
was
inapplicable
because
of
the
so-called,
“law
enforcement
proviso”.
this
provision
of
the
ftca
authorized
a
suit
for
certain
intentional
torts
committed
by
federal
law
enforcement
officers.
the
third
circuit
disagreed
with
millbrook.
it
held
that
the
law
enforcement
proviso
only
waives
sovereign
immunity
when
the
federal
officer's
conduct
occurs
in
the
course
of
executing
a
search,
seizing
evidence
for
making
an
arrest.
the
court,
thus,
concluded
that
millbrook's
claims
were
barred.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
the
ftca's
law
enforcement
proviso
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
any
claim
“arising
out
of
assault
or
battery”
that
is
based
on
the
acts
or
omissions
of
law
enforcement
officers
of
the
united
states
government.
so
long
as
the
officer
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
this
employment,
the
proviso
defines
law
enforcement
officer
to
mean
any
officer
of
the
united
states
who
is
empowered
by
law
to
execute
searches,
seize
evidence,
or
to
make
arrest
for
violations
of
federal
law.
the
question
is
whether
the
law
enforcement
proviso
waives
sovereign
immunity
for
millbrook's
assault
and
battery
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
have
taken
three
different
approaches
to
the
law
enforcement
proviso.
the
third
circuit
limits
the
waiver
to
cases
where
law
enforcement
officers
are
executing
a
search,
seizing
evidence,
or
making
an
arrest.
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
was
slightly
broader
and
holds
its
sovereign
immunity
as
waived
if
a
tort
is
committed
while
law
enforcement
officers
are
engaged
in
“law
enforcement
activity.”
the
final
approach
adapted
by
the
fourth
circuit
only
requires
officers
to
be
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
we
agreed
with
the
last
approach
because
it
is
consistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
law
enforcement
proviso
states
when
a
law
enforcement
officers
act
or
mission
give
rise
to
a
tort
claim
under
ftca.
the
challenged
conduct
must
arise
from
106
enumerated
intentional
torts
and
the
officer's
acts
or
missions
must
fall
within
the
scope
of
this
office,
his
office
or
employment.
nothing
else
in
the
text
further
qualifies
what
acts
or
missions
trigger
liability
under
the
ftca.
for
this
reason
and
other
stated
in
the
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
law
enforcement
proviso
extends
to
acts
or
missions
of
law
enforcement
officers
that
arise
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
