under
--
under
that
provision,
that's
certainly
true.
you
can't
--
you
can't
get
costs
under
that
provision
unless
there
has
been
that
prerequisite.
but
it's
--
it's
ancient
law
that
repeals
by
implication
are
not
favored.
and
what
you're
arguing
here
is
that
that
provision
effectively
repeals
another
provision
which
allows
costs
in
all
cases,
whether
or
not
there
has
been
misbehavior.
now,
why
--
why
is
this
an
exception
to
our
general
rule?
i
just
don't
--
this
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
the
clear
repealer.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
--
we
have
to
assume
ignorance
of
the
drafter.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
a
general
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
--
in
that
respect,
it
is
different
from
radlax,
in
which
the
two
provisions
--
where
we
held
the
specific
covers
the
general,
but
we
held
that
because
the
two
provisions
contradicted
each
other.

[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
a
lot
of
cases
that
say
that
--
that
the
agency's
views
about
what
courts
should
do
are
not
entitled
to
deference.
this
is
--
this
is
a
matter--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
in
the
first
sentence
of
3,
the
phrase
“
the
costs
of
the
action
”
is
really
superfluous
in
light
of
54(d)(1).
you
really
don't
know
that.
i
mean,
that
would
have
been
the
case
anyway.
so
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
it
isn't
frivolous
in
the
second
sentence
--
or
superfluous
in
the
second
sentence,
right?
why
did
they
have
to
say
the
costs
of
the
action
in
the
case
of
a
successful
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
costs
of
the
action,
together
with
a
reasonable
--
as
determined
by
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
--
they
have
the
costs
anyway,
if
congress
didn't
write
anything,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
gotcha.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
the
case
that,
in
order
to
appeal
to
the
proposition
that
the
specific
governs
the
general,
you
--
you
have
to
read
the
second
sentence
of
3
as
containing
a
negative
--
a
negative
implication?
as
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
may
not.
so
you
are
reading
in
a
negative--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
--
suppose
the
words
“
and
costs
”
were
left
out
in
the
second
sentence.
would
not
the
argument
be
made
that
you
cannot
award
costs
even
in
an
action
brought
in
bad
faith?
wouldn't
--
that
this
sum
argument
you're
making--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you're
saying
“
negative
implication
”.
if
it
--
if
it
says
only
"attorneys
fees
in
reasonable
relation
to
the
work
expended.
"
the
implication
would
be
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
cannot
--
you
cannot,
even
in
the
case
of
a
frivolous
action,
award
costs.
wouldn't
that
be
the
reading
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
but
i'm
suggesting
if
that
argument
is
rejected,
so
should
yours
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
seems
the
two
are
parallel.
