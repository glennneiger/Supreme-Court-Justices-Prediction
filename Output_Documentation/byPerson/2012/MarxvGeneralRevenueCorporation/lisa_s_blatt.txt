ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
the
second
sentence
of
section
1692k(a)(3)
is
a
pro-defendant
provision
that
does
not
strip
courts
of
their
discretion
under
rule
54
to
award
costs
to
prevailing
defendants.
we
think
that
first
because
of
the
text
and
structure,
and
second,
because
of
the
statutory
history
and
purpose.
as
to
the
text,
the
second
sentence
states
that
a
court
may
award
an
affirmative
grant
of
power
rather
than
the
court
may
award
attorney's
fees
and
costs
if
a
plaintiff
files
a
lawsuit
in
bad
faith.
the
text
doesn't
say
that
a
court
may
not
award
costs
in
the
absence
of
bad
faith.
the
text
doesn't
say
or
even
address
a
court's
discretion
to
award
costs
to
prevailing
defendants
as
an
ordinary
incident
of
defeat.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
i
disagree
with
everything
you
said
for
the
following
reasons--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--this
is
not
a
field
preemption
case.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
it
is.
you're
saying
that
if
it
addresses
costs,
that
it
trumps
it.
and
it
is
a
--
you
would
never
think
--
this
--
rule
54
doesn't
say
don't
award
costs
if
a
statute
can
be
plausibly
read
to
address
it.
it
says
unless
it
provides
otherwise,
which
means
congress
actually
intended
to
displace.
and
unless
you
actually
think
that
this
provision
intends
to
take
away
a
cost
authority--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--you
don't
get
there.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay,
here's
why
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
displace
it.
it
doesn't
in
terms
of
the
plain
text;
it
just
doesn't.
it
doesn't
say
any
--
there's
no
disabling
aspect
about
it.
it's
an
affirmative
grant
to
protect
a
defendant,
and
when
you
say
to
a
court
it
has
sanctioning
power
to
award
attorney's
fees
and
costs,
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
what
happens
in
the
ordinary
case
where
the
defendant
has
prevailed
at
trial
and
been
found
to
be
completely
innocent.
this--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--not
only
do
they
not
contradict,
this
is
not
a
specific
--
when
you
said
--
the
other
thing
i
disagreed
with,
when
you
said
this
comprehensively
addresses
costs,
no,
this
comprehensively
is
about
attorney's
fees.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
is--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--that's
not
correct,
it
doesn't
mention
prevailing--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes.
unlike
--
unlike
the
whole
statute
that
talks
about
prevailing
plaintiffs,
this
doesn't.
what
is
fascinating
about
this
case
is
in
all
50
titles
of
the
u.s.
code,
there
are
specific
provisions
that
say,
plaintiffs
shall
not
be
liable
for
costs,
or
a
plaintiff
shall
not
be
liable
for
costs
unless
a
certain
condition
occurs.
there's
only
one
statute
--
we
looked
at
all
50
titles
--
there
is
one
statute
that
says,
a
court
may
award
costs
if
a
certain
condition
occurs.
that's
the--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--we've
--
we've
looked
for
all,
we've
looked
at
all
the
cost
provisions.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
that's
what's
so
funny
about
this;
nothing
in
this
--
this
case
--
i
don't
mean
to
trivialize
it,
but
there's
only
one
other
statute,
that
electronic
fund
transfers
act
that
talks
about
the
court
shall
award
attorney's
fees
and
costs
if
there
is
bad
faith.
and
there
is
one
other
statute
that
says
for
a
prevailing
defendant,
the
court
may
award
costs
if
the
lawsuit
is
frivolous.
and
in
those
three
significant
ways,
i
think
it
shows
why
we
win,
and
that's
a
statute
they
relied
on
to
say
it's
just
like
our
statute,
on
page
18
of
their
brief,
page
29
of
our
brief.
first,
it
only
refers
to
costs.
the
statute
is
about
costs.
our
statute
is
about
attorney's
fees
being
the
main
event
upon
a
finding
of
bad
faith.
second,
it
mentions
prevailing
defendants;
ours
doesn't.
and
third,
which
i
think
is
missing
from
the
entire
30
minutes
that
you
heard,
their
argument
is
plaintiff
--
is
congress
sat
down
and
wanted
to
incentivize
frivolous
suits,
and
nonfrivolous
--
nonfrivolous
suits
alike.
at
least
in
the
pipeline
safety
act,
congress
said
if
it's
frivolous,
the
defendant
gets
its
costs.
here--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
i
mean,
a
couple
things
about
that.
it's
both
very
common
--
fee
shifting
provisions
routinely
refer
to
both
fees
and
costs,
just
like
salt
and
pepper,
peanut
butter
and
jelly,
they
go
together
as
a
set.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
and
here--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--i
don't
know
about
that
one.
but
here
--
here
i
think
congress
--
first
of
all,
it's
just
wrong
that
the
reference
to
“
and
costs
”
is
grammatically
inexplicable
and
devoid
of
practical
function;
and
that
is
the
fundamental
point
of
the
blue
brief,
that
this
is
just
grammatically
inexplicable,
and
that's
just
not
true.
what
“
and
costs
”
does
is
it,
basically
the
word
“
and
”
is
being
used
to
mean
“
in
addition
to
”.
“
and
”
means
“
in
addition
to
”.
and
so
what
congress
is
saying
is
when
courts
fee
shift,
attorney's
fee
shift
on
a
finding
of
bad
faith,
courts
additionally
may
award
costs
in
addition
to
and
over
and
above
the
attorney's
fees
that
were
measured
in
relationship
to
the
work
performed.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
i
think
their
policy
argument
is
--
i
mean,
it
could
not
be
worse.
a
homeless
person--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--no,
it
couldn't
be
worse,
and
here's
why.
a
homeless
person
filing
a
civil
rights
case
has
to
pay
costs,
and
at
last
that
person
has
to
pay
--
has
to
prove
damages?
this
plaintiff
gets
$1,000
for
free.
second
of
all,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
never
asks
for
relief.
well,
54
is
discretionary.
if
this
woman
was
in
pain
and
suffering,
why
didn't
she
say,
district
court,
i
can't
afford
this?
it
is
the
law
in
every
circuit
that
the
district
courts
don't
have
to
award
costs,
it's
discretionary.
so
rule
54
has
a
built-in
safety
valve;
it
accommodates
all
the
policy
concerns
on
the
other
side,
and
every
other
informal
paupers
litigant,
every
consumer
rights
plaintiff,
every
civil
rights
plaintiff,
every
plaintiff
in
the
country
faces
the
risk
of
a
cost
award
but
doesn't
get
$1,000
thrown
in
for
free.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
obviously
not.
i
don't
even
know
where
they
would
get
a
basis
for
deference.
i'm
sorry--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--but
that
would
be
ledbetter,
and
i
don't
want
to
cite
that
to
justice
ginsburg.
[laughter]
so
i
think
the
better
answer
is
what's
so
mystifying
about
their
policy
argument
is
that
they
enforce
--
they
enforce
20
consumer
protection
statutes,
and
all
of
them,
their
--
their
plaintiffs
have
to
pay
costs.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
they're--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
i'm
happy
to
go
canon
to
canon.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that's
the
government.
the--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--okay.
well,
i
don't
think
--
canons,
you
know,
don't
trump
common
sense,
context,
history--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--but
let's
go
to
canons.
let's
go
to
canons,
specific
versus
the
general.
it's
all
word
games.
it
turns
on
what
you
think
“
specific
”
means.
this
is
not
specific
to
the
question
presented
about
prevailing
parties
and
costs.
this
is
about
attorney's
fees.
that
--
and
costs
are
on
top
of
attorney's
fees,
is
essentially
how--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--i
don't
wish
for
a
different
statute.
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
congress
passed
a
firewall;
congress
said,
we
need
to
encourage
frivolous
suits
and
nonfrivolous,
but
let's
put
a
firewall
in
and
give
them
fees
and
costs,
that
god
forbid
there
is
bad
faith
and
harassment.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
--
it
affirmatively
gives
district
courts
emboldening
power
to
sanction.
so--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--but
not
if
you
file
a
lawsuit
in
bad
faith
and
for
purposes
of
harassment.
so
i
mean
--
i
think
even
--
i
think
the
history
is
obvious;
this
was
trying
to
make
defendants
better
off
than
the
defendant's
suit
under
the
truth
in
lending
act
which
is
part
of
the
same
umbrella
consumer
credit
protection
act,
and
they're
--
inexplicably,
somehow,
by
trying
to
make
them
better
off
made
them
worse
than
every
other
creditor
that
they
serve,
and
immunized
these
plaintiffs
from
the
universal
risk
of
cost
shifting
that
every
other
litigant
has
to
face,
and
so
--
and
you
don't
get
there
from
--
all
they
have
is
a
negative
inference.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
doesn't
speak
to
prevailing
defendants.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yeah,
i'm
going
--
i'm
going
to
keep
repeating
it
because
it's
my
position.
this
doesn't
--
does
the
fact
that
this
doesn't
refer
to
prevailing
defendants
speaks
volumes
that
what
was
not
on
congress's
mind
was
rule
54.
what
was
on
congress's
mind
is
victimized
debt
collectors
who
were
sued
in
bad
faith.
now,
i
understand
this
is
a
pro-plaintiff
statute,
but
this
would
be
extraordinary
to
think
that
they
gave
them
attorney's
fees
when
they
--
but
it's
basically
saying
--
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
defendant
who
went
to
trial
and
won,
was
law
abiding,
didn't
do
anything
wrong,
and
congress
in
that
situation
said
not
only
might
--
might
not
the
suit
be
--
be
--
have
merit
or
good
faith,
it
might
have
even
been
frivolous.
when
under
rule
54
--
again,
this
is
what
i
find
so
mystifying
about
this
case.
if
the
petitioner
thought,
oh,
i
had
a
really
hard
case
in
the
law
or
oh,
i'm
really
poor,
she
could
have
asked
for
discretionary
relief.
instead,
the
lawyer
went
into
court
and
said,
i
have
a
recent
ninth
circuit
decision
and
i
don't
have
to
pay
costs
at
all.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
54(d)?
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
uh-huh.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
we
wouldn't
--
certainly,
we
sought
costs
here
under
rule
54.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
i
know.
okay.
and
you've
took
it
up.
so
that
takes
out
my
route
seeking
for
costs
under
rule
54,
it
doesn't
exist
in
your
world.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
i'm
imagining
then
the
world
in
1936,
and
we
rely
on
1920
or
1919
or
the
long-standing
practice
of
courts
awarding
costs.
now,
a
court
might--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--we
would
not
get
costs
under
this
provision,
you're
correct.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
because
this
--
in
that
sense,
i
think
this
was
a
question
that
another
justice
asked.
if
you
just
look
at
this
provision,
the
only
basis
for
costs
and
fees
in
this
provision
is
the
bad
faith
finding
of
harassment.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
under
1692.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
because
--
because,
again,
rule
54
is
not
preemption,
a
field
preemption.
it's
saying
if
congress
intended
to
displace,
the
proviso,
unless
otherwise
provided,
it
was
recognition
that
other
statutes
might
displace
rule
54.
and
if
you
look
at
all
the
statutes
that
we
cite
on
pages
19
and
20,
they
actually
do
prohibit
costs.
and
then
if
you
look
at
the
statutes
on
pages
24
and
25,
where
time
and
time
again
congress
has
said
a
prevailing
party
may
recover
attorney's
fees
and
costs,
well,
the
“
and
costs
”
in
their
view,
i
guess
those
statutes
are
inexplicable.
i
mean,
it's
clearly
they're
redundant
and
they
overlap
with
rule
54.
they
don't
displace
it.
and
even
the
practice
guides
that
we
cite
on
page
22,
which
is
basically
wright
and
miller
and
moore,
say
something
that
merely
overlaps
with
rule
54
doesn't
displace
the
court's
discretion.
and
again,
i
think
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
what
was
congress
doing?
to
me,
this
is
--
this
is
a
--
the
attorney's
fees
are
the
main
show,
it
goes
with
bad
faith,
congress
was
not
thinking
about
rule
54,
and
i
think
you
can
be
quite
confident
congress
was
not
thinking,
we
want
plaintiff
lawyers
to
go
around
saying
not
only
congress,
but
the
government
wanted
us
to
file
frivolous
suits.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes,
if
you
--
right.
and
so
there's
like
that
oncale
case
with
same
sex
harassment,
congress
can
write
a
very
--
can
write
a
plain
language
provision
and
regardless
of
what
congress
intended,
if
the
language
covers
it,
that's
tough,
we're
going
to
construe
it.
that's
your
law.
this
is
not
that.
this
--
this
doesn't
say
anything
about
prevailing
parties.
this
is
talking
about
bad
faith
and
attorney's
fees.
it
doesn't
say
a
court
can't
act
in
the
absence
of
bad
faith,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
prevailing
parties,
it
doesn't
reveal
any
intent
to
displace
it,
especially
when
you
compare
it
with
all
the
other
statutes,
you
look
at
the
history.
sorry.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
prevailing
defendants
--
i
agree,
sorry.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yeah.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no,
because
it
says
expressly
in
a
case
of
successful
action,
it
talks
about
prevailing
plaintiffs,
and
then
it
says
if
there's
--
to
me,
it's
just
--
it's
natural
when
you
just
read
it
in
light
of
sort
of
common
sense
in
context
in
what
congress
was
doing.
if
a
plaintiff
files
in
bad
faith,
the
court
is
empowered
and
emboldened
--
it's
like
a
neon
light
--
courts,
you
have
authority
to
award
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yeah.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yeah,
and
i
think--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
and
i
think
you
have
to
keep
this
in
mind
that
there
are
completely
diametrically
opposed
background
presumptions
in
our
legal
system.
it's
an
extraordinary
event
to
get
attorney's
fees,
and
it's
an
extraordinary
event
not
to
get
costs.
and
so
the
court
--
the
congress
has
to
use
explicit
language
to
over
--
overturn
the
american
rule.
and
so
what
congress
did
here,
that
is
the
most
natural,
even
if
i
drew
you
to
a
tie--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right,
and--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--and
i
think
you
can
look
--
the
petitioner
did
--
did
a
valiant
job
of
trying
to
drudge
up
as
many
statutes
as
they
can.
all
the
statutes
on
point
are
explicit.
now,
there's
one
statute
that
might
not
be,
the
pipeline
safety
one.
and
so
the
question
is:
do
we
think
that
congress
actually
tried
to
displace
a
court's
authority
under
that
statute,
and
that's
a
statute
that
just
says
a
court
may
award
costs
if
a
lawsuit
is
frivolous.
this
one
just
doesn't
say
that.
you
at
least
--
even
if
you
don't
think
of
it
as
magic
language
or
an
explicit
statement,
the
fact
that
congress
repeatedly
has
used
explicit
language
casts
considerable
doubt
that
this
was
done
by
mere
implication,
and
then
you
look
at
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
mention
prevailing
parties,
it's
talking
about
bad
faith,
it
has
attorney's
fees,
what
was
congress
doing,
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
it
shows
that
it
was
--
it
was
trying
to
make
them
better
off
than
a
class
of
defendants,
but
their
view
inexplicably
makes
them
worse
off.
and
then
you
look
at
the
result
that
they're
actually
advocating
that
the
government
thinks
it's
a
good
idea
that
plaintiffs
can
file
lawsuits
cost
free
that
are
frivolous.
i
mean--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--successful
action
to
enforce
it.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
why
isn't--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--i
mean,
i
think
that
--
again
--
i
mean--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yeah,
i
know.
and
i
was
going
to
say
there's
so
much
is
superfluity
in
here,
i
don't
know
where
to
begin.
it's
all
over
the
place.
the
whole
thing
obviously
overlaps
with
the
court's
inherent
authority.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no,
it's
clear
“
shall
”.
it's
clear
“
shall
”
obviously.
the
first
sentence
does--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--oh,
yes,
that's
right.
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that's
true.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yeah.
the
question,
though,
was
in
the
case
of
any
successful
action
when,
obviously,
they
prevailed
to
begin
with,
so
the
question
is
whether
that's
superfluous.
but
the
whole
provision
overlaps
with
the
court's
inherent
authority.
and
i
know
it
hasn't
come
up,
but
i
just
think
it's
strange
that
it
says
for
the
purposes
of
bad
faith
and
harassment,
congress
was
obviously
using
belt
and
suspenders
there,
so
it's
not
surprising
that
congress
added
“
and
costs
”
here.
if
you
look
at
rule
54
--
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing,
justice
kagan
--
if
you
look
at
rule
54,
it
also
says
"unless
the
statute
provides
otherwise,
costs
other
than
attorney's
fees.
"
so
why
--
they
didn't
have
to
say
that,
because
in
the
next
provision
it
talks
about
attorney's
fees.
they
just
--
they
wanted
to
make
clear
for
whatever
reason
or
maybe
they
just
wrote
some
really
excess,
redundant,
silly
language,
but
they
said
costs,
meaning
anything
that's
not
costs.
it's
just
that
congress
sometimes
uses
these,
and
i
guess
this
was
the
honey
and
peanut
butter
thing,
that
a
lot
of
fee-shifting
statutes
talk
about
both
attorney's
fees
and
costs,
and
so
they
went
together
and
--
they
also
mentioned
it.
obviously,
it's
different.
i
agree
that
there's
a
verb
in
the
first
sentence
that's
mandatory,
so
it
trumps
rule
54.
but
with
respect
to
the
two
objects,
congress
was
already
thinking
about
attorney's
fees
and
costs
anyway
and
so
there's
nothing
wrong
with
them
saying,
in
addition
to
the
attorney's
fees
that
you
can
get
in
bad
faith,
once
you
calculate
the
attorney's
fees
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
work
performed,
you
also
get
costs.
and
the
only
thing
i
would
say,
when
we
define
“
and
”
as
in
addition
to,
they
seem
to
think
that
that
was
an
extraordinary
reading
of
the
word
“
and
”,
citing
something
from
something
called
[dictionarydotcom,]
and
if
you
just
went
to
[dictionarydotcom,]
which
i
had
not
done
before,
and
you
type
in
“
and
”,
the
first
definition
is
“
in
addition
to
”.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
