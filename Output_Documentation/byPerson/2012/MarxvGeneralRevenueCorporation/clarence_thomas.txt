justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
prohibits
certain
debt
collection
practices.
olivea
marx
filed
a
lawsuit
against
general
revenue
corporation,
alleging
that
it
violated
the
act
by
harrassing
and
threatening
her
in
order
to
collect
the
debt.
the
district
court
ruled
against
marx
and
awarded
respondent,
general
revenue
corporation,
cost
pursuant
to
rule
54(d)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
this
rule
gives
the
courts
the
discretion
to
award
cost
to
the
prevailing
party,
unless
a
federal
statute
provides
otherwise.
marx,
moved
to
vacate
the
award
arguing
that
section
1692k(a)(3)
of
the
fdcpa
provides
otherwise.
that
section
provides
that
“on
a
finding
by
the
court
that
an
action
under
this
section
was
brought
in
bad
faith
and
for
the
purpose
of
harassment,
the
court
may
award
the
defendant
attorney's
fees
reasonable
in
relation
to
the
work
expended
and
costs.”
that's
a
sentence
crying
out
for
editing.
marx
argued
that
this
provision
means
that
a
court
may
award
cost
to
the
defendant,
only
on
a
finding
that
the
action
was
brought
in
bad
faith.
in
her
view,
because
she
brought
the
case
in
good
faith,
the
respondent
was
not
entitled
to
cost.
the
district
court
rejected
marx's
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed.
it
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
costs
were
allowed
under
rule
54(d)
even
in
the
absence
of
bad
faith
because
nothing
in
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
displaced
the
judge's
discretion
under
that
rule.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
tenth
circuit.
rule
54(d)
gives
courts
discretion
to
award
cost
to
prevailing
parties.
that
discretion
can
be
displaced
by
a
federal
statute
that
“provides
otherwise.”
a
statute
provides
otherwise
if
it
is
contrary
to
the
rule
54(d).
the
language
and
context
of
section
1692k(a)(3)
persuade
us
that
it
is
not
contrary
to
rule
54(d).
section
1692k(a)(3)
provides
that
when
a
plaintiff
brings
an
action
in
bad
faith,
the
court
may
award
attorney's
fees
and
costs
to
the
defendant.
the
best
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
congress
intended
it
to
deter
plaintiffs
from
bringing
lawsuits
in
bad
faith,
but
it
does
not
address
whether
cost
may
be
awarded
in
this
--
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
the
plaintiff
brought
the
case
in
good
faith.
marx
argue
that
by
specifying
that
a
court
may
award
attorney's
fees
and
cost
when
an
action
is
brought
in
bad
faith,
congress
intended
to
preclude
a
court
from
awarding
fees
and
costs
when
bad
faith
and
purpose
of
harassment
are
absent.
we
are
not
persuaded
by
that
argument.
the
statute
provides
that
when
the
plaintiff
brings
an
action
in
bad
faith,
the
court
may
award
attorney's
fees
to
the
defendant,
but
a
court
has
inherent
power
to
award
attorney's
fees
based
on
a
litigant's
bad
faith
even
without
section
1692k(a)(3).
the
fact
that
section
1692k(a)(3)
codifies
the
background
rules
for
attorney's
fees,
weighs
against
inferring
congressional
intent
to
override
the
background
rule
with
respect
to
cost.
we
note
that
congress
has
expressly
limited
court's
discretion
to
award
cost
in
other
statutes.
had
congress
intended
section
1692k(a)(3)
to
displace
the
rule,
it
would
have
--
it
could
have
easily
done
so
by
saying
that
the
court
may
award
cost
to
the
defendant
only
on
a
finding
that
the
action
was
brought
in
bad
faith
and
for
the
purpose
of
harassment.
for
these
reasons
and
reasons
setup
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
section
1692k(a)(3)
does
not
provide
otherwise,
than
rule
54(d)
and
that
the
district
court
had
discretion
to
award
cost
without
finding
that
the
plaintiff
brought
the
action
in
bad
faith.
