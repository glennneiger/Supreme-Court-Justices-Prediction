justice

didn't
--
don't
district
courts
always
have
the
authority
to
award
costs
for
sanctionable
behavior
like
bad
faith?
so
this
provision
is
duplicate
no
matter
how
we
read
it.
it's
either
duplicative
of
a
power
the
court
already
had
to
award
costs
for
bad
faith
or
it's
duplicate
of
rule
54.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
limits
rule
54.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
your
--
your
answer
is
always
that
rule
54
obligates
court
to
give
costs.
and
this
rule,
as
you
read
it,
is
a
permissive
grant
only.
even
in
bad
faith
litigations,
a
court
could
choose
not
to
give
costs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
true.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
would
assume
that
if
rule
54,
instead
of
saying
what
it
currently
does,
said
something
like
"except
as
expressly
repealed
in
another
statute.
"
would
what
happened
here
meet
that
express
requirement
of
repeal?
it
was
justice
scalia's
question
to
you,
but
reformulated
in
a
different
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
expressly
repealed
54(d).
justice
sonia
sotomayor
am
i
to
understand
your
simple
position
to
be
that
what
rule
54(d)
says
is
if
another
provision
deals
with
costs,
you're
relegated
to
that
other
provision.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
unless,
and
this
--
you're
inverting
the
express
--
unless
that
provision
refers
you
back
to
54.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
with
that
is
that
there
are
some
statutes
that
don't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
not
always
peanut
butter
and
jelly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
peanut
butter
and
honey
sometimes.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
it
was
thinking
about
prevailing
parties
because
the
predecessor
sentence--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
it
was
talking
--
no,
prevailing
parties.
the
provision
is
geared
towards
prevailing
parties
in
some
form.
the
first
sentence
says
a
prevailing
plaintiff,
not
whether
it's
on
a
substantial
basis
or
any
exception.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
says
you
get
fees
or
you
can
get
fees
and
costs.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
then
decides
to
limit
what
a
prevailing
defendant
can
do.
isn't
that
a
natural
reading?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
think
that
there's
a
serious
argument
that
the
first
sentence
does
away
with
the
discretionary
nature?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
a
command.
54(d)
is
permissive
according
to
your
earlier
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
this
does
--
it's
not
superfluous
because
it
went
to
mandatory.
