ms.

m.
zieve
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rule
54(d)
provides
a
standard
for
an
award
of
costs
to
a
prevailing
party
that,
by
the
rule's
express
terms,
does
not
apply
where
federal
statute
provides
otherwise.
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
provides
otherwise
because
it
states
a
different
rule
for
awarding
costs
than
does
rule
54(d).
whereas
rule
54(d)
gives
district
courts
wide
discretion
toward
cost-prevailing
defendants,
the
fdcpa
limits
courts'
discretion
to
cases
brought
in
bad
faith
and
for
the
purpose
of
harassment.
the
text
of
the
act
provides
that
on
a
finding
that
action
was
brought
in
bad
faith
and
for
the
purpose
of
harassment,
the
court
may
award
attorneys'
fees
of
reasonable
relation
to
the
work
expended
and
costs.
that's
a
matter
of
grammar.
the
unmistakable
meaning
of
that
sentence
is
that
an
award
of
costs,
like
an
award
of
attorney's
fees,
is
subject
to
the
condition
that
the
plaintiff
suit
be
brought--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
there's
no
need
to
consider
repeal
by
implication
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
rule
54(d)
expressly
states
that
its
presumption
does
not
apply
for
a
federal--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
section
k(a)(3)
as
a
whole,
the
two
sentences
together
confirm
that
this
is
not
a
provision
about
bad-faith
plaintiffs,
but,
rather,
the
provision
is
addressing
both
fees
and
costs
to
--
to
plaintiffs
and
defendants.
and
if
--
if
the
congress
merely
wanted
to
state
in
that
second
sentence
that
fees
were
available
and
didn't
mean
to
say
anything
about
costs
to
defendants,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
congress
to
have
put
costs
in
that
sentence.
if--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
you've
made
a
few
points,
and
i'll
try
to
address
each
of
them.
first,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
include
costs
in
the
second
sentence
just
because
it
was
in
the
first
sentence,
because
the
first
and
second
sentences
are
not
parallel.
the
first
sentence
makes
an
award
of
costs
mandatory,
and,
therefore,
it
does
do
some
work
beyond
54(d);
it
clearly
has
a
function
in
that
sentence.
whereas
the
second
sentence,
the
award
is
subject
to
the
“
may
”;
that
is,
that
it's
not
mandatory
that
the
court
award
them.
if
--
if
congress
was
--
congress
would
have
no
need
to
be
concerned
that
if
it
left
costs
out
of
the
second
sentence
there
would
be
some
negative
implication,
because
there
are
several
statutes
that
mention
fees
without
costs.
and
grc
has
cited
no
instance
in
which
a
court
has
read
a
negative
implication
into
that.
we,
in
our
reply
brief,
cited
a
couple
cases
that
do
the
opposite.
it's
--
so,
therefore,
if
congress
had
omitted
costs,
left
it
out
of
the
sentence,
then
rule
54(d)
would
have
continued
to
apply
in
cases
where
the
defendants.
one
more
example--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
if
you
read
this
sentence
as
a
misconduct
provision,
then
it
does
repeat
the
court's
inherent
authority;
although,
as
this
court
has
mentioned
in
a
couple
cases,
sometimes
statutes
want
to
reiterate
authority
that
exists
elsewhere.
if
you
read
it
our
way,
however,
the
statute
--
this
provision
does
actually
do
some
work
that
it
wouldn't
otherwise
do.
that
is,
it
limits
cost
awards
to
prevailing
defendants
of
these
circumstances.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
right.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
rule
54
doesn't
obligate
a
court
to
give
costs;
it
establishes
a
presumption--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--and
this
says
the
presumption
is
limited
to
cases
brought
in
bad
faith
and
for
purposes
of
harassment.
there
are
other
statutes
that
do
--
similarly
do
what
we've
--
what's
done
here.
congress
could
have
omitted
--
if
grc
is
correct,
congress
could
have
just
omitted
the
words
“
and
costs
”,
leaving
the
costs
to
be
determined
under
rule
54.
an
example
of
that
is
15
u.s.c.
15c(d)(2),
which
is
actions
by
state
attorneys
general
and
provides
that
the
court
may
award
attorneys
fees
to
a
prevailing
defendant
upon
a
finding
that
the
action
was
in
bad
faith.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
fair
credit?
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well,
first,
your
honor,
the
congress's
purpose
was
not
simply
to
--
this
isn't
just
a
defendant-friendly
provision.
congress
had
dual
purposes
in
enacting
k(a)(3).
on
the
one
hand,
congress
wanted
to
deter
nuisance
suits,
but
on
the
other
hand,
congress
wanted
to
ensure
that
meritorious
suits
by
impecunious
debtors
were
not
deterred
by
the
prospect
that
an
award
of
costs
would
exceed
the
value
of
the
damage
that
could
be
recovered
in
a
successful
suit.
and
the
two
provisions
of
k(a)(3)
show
the
line
congress
drew
and
how
it
balanced
those
two
objectives.
as
to
the
other
statutes,
the
truth
in
lending
act,
the
credit
repair
organizations
act,
they
were
enacted
at
different
times
by
different
congresses,
they
have
different
sorts
of
provisions,
some
better
for
plaintiffs,
some
better
for
defendants.
and
--
but
this
category
--
in
enacting
this
statute,
congress
emphasized
that
the
widespread
and
national
serious
problem
of
collection
abuse
that
congress
said
inflicts
substantial
suffering
and
anguish,
and
noted
specifically
in
the
senate
report
this
court
has
cited
to
in
the
jerman
case
that
consumers,
the
impecunious
--
the
people
who
can't
even
afford
to
pay
their
debts,
are
the
primary
enforcers
of
the
statute.
the
ftc
got
about
120,000
complaints
from
consumers
about
debt
collectors
last
year,
more
than
any
other
industry.
so
congress
may
reasonably
have
decided
that
the
primary
enforcers
of
this
statute
weren't
going
to
be
doing
that
work
if
they
were
--
if
they
were
at
risk
of
significant
cost
awards
in
cases
that
have
frequently
small
value.
there
are
other
ways,
if
congress
wanted
to
preserve
rule
54(d),
that
it
could
have
done
it
that
did
not
happen
here.
for
instance,
in
49
u.s.c.
14707
(c),
congress
has
a
similar
provision
about
attorney's
fees
to
prevailing
--
attorney's
fees
to
prevailing
parties,
and
then
states
expressly
that
fee
is
in
addition
to
costs
allowable
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
congress
didn't
do
that
here.
or
congress
could
have
made
it
clear
that
it
was
not
displacing
rule
54(d)
as
to
cost
awards
by
stating
that
the
court
could
award
attorney's
fees
as
part
of
the
cost,
therefore
distinguishing
fees
and
costs.
congress
has
done
that
sort
of
thing
frequently,
including
in
a
statute
that
provides
for
an
award
in
cases
of
bad
faith.
i'm
looking
at
28
u.s.c.
1875,
that
provides
the
courts
may
award
fees
as
part
of
costs
if
an
action
was
frivolous
or
in
bad
faith.
so
--
but
congress
did
none
of
those
things
here.
instead,
what
it
did
was
draft
a
sentence
that
links
the
term
“
cost
”
to
the
term
“
attorney's
fees
”
with
the
conjunction
“
and
”,
and
subjects
both
of
those
objects
of
the
sentence
to
the
same
condition,
the
condition
that
the
plaintiff
suit
was
brought
in
bad
faith
and
for
purpose
of
harassment.
grc
suggests
that
the
reading
--
that
the
statute
the
justice
mentioned,
benefits
plaintiffs.
but
what
congress
wanted
to
do
here
--
i
mean,
would
benefit
plaintiff
--
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
help
defendants.
there's
actually
no
legislative
history
about
why
this
provision
was
put
in
there.
what
we
have
instead,
for
what
it's
worth,
is
a
markup
later
where
this
provision
is
discussed
in
response
to
concerns
that
frivolous
suits
should
be
deterred,
and
this
provision,
which
is
now
already
in
the
statute,
is
discussed
as
one
means
of
deterring
frivolous
suits.
but
the
bad
faith
and
harassment
standard
is
the
dividing
line
that
congress
drew
between
nuisance
suits
and
other
suits.
this
case
is
clearly
on
the
non-nuisance
side
of
the
line,
and
cases
on
that
side
of
the
line
are
not
subject
to
an
award
of
costs.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--if
rule
54(d)
incorporated
a
requirement
that
a
statute
expressly
referred
to
rule
54(d)?
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
that
would
be
a
very
different
case.
but
of
course,
rule
54(d)
doesn't
do
that.
instead,
when
rule
54(d)
was
adopted,
the
rules
committee
actually
--
the
advisory
committee
notes
list
25
statutes
that
it
says
will
not
be
affected
by
the
rule.
those
are
statutes
that
allow
fees,
forbid
fees,
condition
fees,
allow
fees
in
a
broader
scope
of
cases
than
rule
54(d)
does.
and
of
course,
none
of
those
would
have
mentioned
rule
54(d)
because
they
preceded
adoption
of
the
rule.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
thank
you.
first,
the
fdcpa
doesn't
just
encourage
frivolous
suits.
ms.
blatt
repeatedly
referred
to
plaintiffs
getting
a
free
$1,000.
if
the
--
if
the
plaintiffs
win
their
suits,
that
means
both
that
they're
not
frivolous
and
they're
not
in
bad
faith.
in
cases
that
are
frivolous
but
a
court
makes
a
finding
that
it's
not
in
bad
faith,
defendants
have
other
means
of
recovering
fees
and
costs
using
rule
11
or
section
1927;
and
there
are
cases
in
which
courts
have
denied
fees
and
costs
under
the
fdcpa
and
granted
them
under
rule
11
or
1927.
ms.
blatt
suggested
that--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--our
position
is
that
this
provision,
k(a)(3),
discusses
the
allocation
of
fees
and
costs
that
come
at
the
end
of
the
case
based
on
who
won
and
who
lost.
and
if
you
read
it
as
a
whole,
as
i
think
justice
kagan
suggested,
that's
what
congress
was
doing.
it
was
carefully
calibrating
the
allocation
of
fees
and
costs
at
the
end
of
the
case.
and,
in
fact,
in
instances
in
which
--
which
defendants
have
asked
for
fees
and
costs
in
fdcpa
cases
based
on
bad
faith,
they
do
always
come
at
the
end
of
the
case.
which
also
shows
this
is
not
a
misconduct
provision.
if
it
were
a
misconduct
provision,
it
wouldn't
just
be
about
bad
faith
in
bringing
the
action.
the
fair
credit
reporting
act,
for
example,
has
a
provision
that
provides
for
fees
but
not
costs
that
speaks
to
conduct
throughout
the
case,
but
with
respect
to
bad
faith
filings
of
pleadings,
motions,
or
other
papers.
that's
a
misconduct
provision;
this
one
isn't.
the
main--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--yeah.
we
do
read
the
“
court
may
award
”
to
mean
"and,
in
other
circumstances,
it
may
not.
"
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
just
as
this
court
--
just
as
this
court
read
“
may
”
in
cooper
industries
or
crawford
fittings
and
said,
"if
you
don't
read
“
may
”
to
define
the
scope
of
what
congress
is
authorizing
the
court
to
do,
then
that
provision
has
no
meaning.
"
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
right,
she
did
agree
that
without
rule
54
this
provision
--
that
--
that
no
costs
could
be
awarded
to
a
defendant
unless
they
had
acted
in
bad
faith.
i
mean,
i
think
at
some
points
grc
and
ms.
blatt
here
today
asked
you
to
just
ignore
that
“
and
costs
”
exists
in
the
sentence
at
all.
although
the
fact
that
this
sentence
is
not
replicated
numerous
times
throughout
the
u.s.
code
doesn't
seem
to
me
reason
for
ignoring
it,
but,
rather,
for
giving
effect
to
it.
congress
obviously
thought
it
was
doing
something
when
it
enacted
this
sentence
and
when
it
added
these
words
to
the
statute.
it
does
not
say,
"the
court
may
award
fees
in
addition
to
costs.
"
or
“
as
part
of
costs
”
or
“
together
with
costs
”.
again,
grammatically,
it
treats
the
two
terms,
“
fees
and
costs
”,
on
a
par--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
there
are
--
no.
there
are
statutes
that
provide
for
fee
awards
and
don't
--
don't
say
anything
about
costs,
and
these
cases
are--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--justice
scalia,
other--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--in
other
cases
under
other
statutes,
that
argument
has
been
made
occasionally
and
rejected.
it's
also
rejected
in
the
treatises
that
we
cite
that
if
you
don't
mention
costs--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--no.
because--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--if
the
--
if
the
statute
does
not
mention
costs,
then
it
doesn't
provide
otherwise
with
respect
to
costs.
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
well--
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
--well,
putting
aside
that
i
hope
that
congress
drafts
a
little
more
carefully
than
a
mother
may
threaten
her
child--
[laughter]
ms.
allison
m.
zieve
but
they're
--
the
presumption
behind
that
hypothetical
is
that
the
one
child
is
going
to
get
their
allowance
no
matter
what.
the
presumption
here
is
that
rule
54(d)
will
apply
unless
a
statute
provides
otherwise.
this
statute
doesn't.
thank
you,
your
honor.
