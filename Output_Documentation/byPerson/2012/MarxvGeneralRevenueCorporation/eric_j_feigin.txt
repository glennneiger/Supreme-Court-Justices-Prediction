mr.
eric
j.
feigin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rule
54(d)
expressly
codifies
in
absolute
form
the
well-established
principle
that
a
specific
provision
displaces
a
more
general
one.
and
i
think
that
principle
is
very
helpful
here
in
answering
a
couple
of
the
questions
that
have
come
up.
first
of
all,
it
makes
clear
that
no
express
textual
conflict
is
necessary.
this
court's
never
required
one,
and
the
specific
governs
the
general
cases.
let's
make
even
clearer,
if
you
look
at
the
pre-2007
version
of
the
rule,
which
is
meant
to
be
substantively
identical
to
the
current
version
of
the
rule
--
this
is
at
page
12
of
the
government's
brief
--
and
the
original
version
of
the
rule
said,
"except
when
express
provision
therefore
is
made
either
in
a
statute
of
the
united
states
or
in
these
rules,
costs
should
be
allowed
as
of
course
to
the
prevailing
party
unless
the
court
otherwise
directs.
"
i
think
that
that
makes
quite
clear
that
when,
as
the
fdcpa
does,
there
is
a
specific
statutory
provision
that
addresses
an
award
of
costs
incident
to
the
judgment,
that
specific
statutory
provision
prevails
over
the
default
rule
that
rule
54(d)
contains.
another
point
about
the
specific
governing
the
general
principle
is
it
would
apply
here
even
if
the
court
believed
that
section
1692k(a)(3)
covered
some
type
of
circumstances
that
rule
54(d)
and
other
things
don't.
and
that's
made
quite
clear
by
this
court's
recent
eight-justice
unanimous
opinion
in
radlax
gateway
hotel
v.
amalgamated
bank,
in
which
the
court
said,
and
i
quote,
"we
know
of
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
canon.
"
--they're
talking
about
the
specific
governance,
the
general
canon
--
"is
confined
to
situations
in
which
the
entirety
of
the
specific
provision
is
a.
"
--quote
--
"“
subset
”
of
the
general
one.
"
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
justice
breyer,
i
think
it
does
expressly
mention
costs
both
in
the
first
and
the
second
sentence.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
if
congress
were
satisfied
with
the
background
rule,
then
i
think
it's
strange
that
they
added
the
words
“
and
costs
”
to
a
sentence
that
is
expressly--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
i
think
that
gets
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
of
why
weren't
they
just
saying
“
and
costs
”
here
just
to
make
clear
that
not
only
fees
would
be
available
but
also
costs.
and
i
think
that's
an
implausible
hypothesis
of
what
congress
was
trying
do
for
the
following
reason.
a
congressperson
who
is
concerned
that
a
reference
to
fees
alone
in
the
second
sentence
of
section
1692k(a)(3)
would
preclude
application
of
the
default
rule
in
--
in
rule
54(d),
couldn't
possibly
have
thought
that
the
way
to
make
clear
that
rule
54(d)
applies
in
full
was
to
add
the
words
“
and
costs
”
in
a
sentence
that's
expressly--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
let
me
--
let
me
address
that
directly.
if
we're
presume
that
congress
is
aware
of
rule
54(d),
then
i
think
it's
quite
peculiar
and,
in
fact,
quite
counterproductive
to
have
added
the
words
“
and
costs
”
to
a
sentence
that's
expressly
conditioned
on
a
finding
of
bad
faith
and
purpose
of
harassment.
but
if
i
accept
your
hypothesis
that
congress
was
not
aware
of
rule
54(d),
again,
it's
quite
strange
that
when
thinking
about
the
cost-shifting
rule
that
should
apply
in
fdcpa
cases,
what
congress
decided
to
do
was
put
the
words
“
and
costs
”
into
a
sentence
that's
expressly--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
the
words
“
and
costs
”
appear
in
both
sentences.
i
agree
with
ms.
zieve
that
the
legislative
history
does
not
indicate
that
this
is
a
uniquely
pro-defendant
division
--
provision,
and
that's
what
the
court
found
in
jerman.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
first
of
all--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--you
can
look
at
--
there
is
no
legislative
history
directly
addressing
the
sentence
we're
trying
to
interpret
today.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
court's
opinion
in
jerman
and
the
hearing
cited
at
page
31
of
the
red
brief,
it
reflects
that
congress
was
trying
to
balance
deterrence
of
nuisance
suits
and
incentivizing
good-faith
consumer
enforcement.
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
address
the
policy
reasons
why
congress
would
have
found
it
particularly
useful
not
to
have
plaintiffs
pay
cost
rule
circumstances.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
the
reason
not
to
give--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
provision
is
uniquely
defendant
friendly.
i
think
it
draws
a
dividing
line
between
nuisance
suits
and
non-nuisance
suits
premised
on
a
finding
of
the
suit
being
brought
in
bad
faith
and
the
purpose
of
harassment.
and
the
reason
why
congress
thought
it
was
necessary
to
shield
good-faith
plaintiffs
from
costs
here
in
order
to
incentivize
enforcement,
is,
first
of
all,
these
are
particularly
low-value
suits,
especially
when
compared
to
other
statutes
in
the
ccpa.
they're
the
kind
of
suits
that
can
be
incentivized
by
a
mere
$1,000
in
statutory
damages.
and
as
this
case
demonstrates,
the
cost
of
a
suit,
if
taxed
against
the
plaintiff,
can
do
much
more
than
1,000--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
plaintiffs--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--plaintiffs
here
are
uniquely
likely
to
be
deterred
because
they're
the
kind
of
people
who
have
been
pursued
by
debt
collectors.
they're
going
to
be
in
debt
themselves;
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
pay
costs.
that's
why
attorneys
--
and
that's
why
the
statute
provides
for
attorneys
generally
to
take
these
cases
on
contingency,
on
the
hope
that
they'll
recover
fees
when
the
plaintiff
is
successful.
now,
if
plaintiff's
looking
to
bring
this
kind
of
case,
the
only
out-of-pocket
expense
the
plaintiff
is
facing
is
the
potential
that
if
it
loses
the
case
for
some
reason
that
it
can't
be
aware
of
initially,
such
as
a
bona
fide
good-faith
defense
or
the
law
being
interpreted
against
them
in
an
area
where
the
law
is
unclear,
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
out
of
pocket
against
the
plaintiff
himself,
not
the
plaintiff's
attorney,
who
are
the
people
the
defendant
claims
is
--
are
responsible
for
the
abuses
they
allege
in
fdcpa
cases.
this
is
going
to
come
out
via
judgment
directly
against
the
plaintiff.
it's
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
enacted
a
provision
specifically
because
it
believed
the
debt
collection
industry
was
forcing,
among
other
things,
personal
bankruptcies
and
wanted
the
kind
of
plaintiffs
who
were
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
enforce
the
fdcpa
to
have
to
face
the
risk
of
incurring
thousands
of
dollars
in
costs
if
they
lose
a
suit
that
they
bring
in
good
faith.
and
the
reason--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
no,
your
honor,
i'd
qualify
that
a
little
bit.
i
think
what
--
we
just
think
it
codifies
an
absolute
form
of
the
specific
governance
to
general
principles.
so
the
first
question
you
asked
is
whether
they're
covering
the
same
territory,
and
they
are
here.
both
1692k(a)(3)
and
54(d)
cover
awards
of
costs
incident
to
the
judgment.
the
second
question
you
asked
is
the
scope
of
the
displacement.
so
it's
possible
that
you
might
have
a
provision,
as
the
first
sentence
of
1692k(a)(3)
does,
that
only
governs
in
certain
circumstances
and
mandates
an
award
of
costs
in
those
circumstances.
we
don't
think
a
sentence
like
that
standing
alone
would
displace
a
court's
discretionary
authority
under
rule
54(d)
to
award
costs
in
other
circumstances.
but
we
don't
think
there's
any
need
--
may
i
finish
the
sentence,
your
honor?
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
we
don't
think
there's
any
need
to
adopt
some
new
special
rule
for
rule
54(d)
that's
different
from
how
this
court
normally
applies
specific
governance
to
general
principle.
thank
you.
