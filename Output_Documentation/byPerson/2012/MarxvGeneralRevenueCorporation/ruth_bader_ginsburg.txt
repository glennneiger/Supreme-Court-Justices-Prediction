yes,
indeed,
but
--
but
you
are
assuming
a
conflict.
you're
saying
either
the
--
the
statute
applies
or
rule
54(d)
applies,
but
the
statute
can
be
read
to
say,
"we're
describing
one
category
of
case.
"
"we
are
describing
the
worst
case;
the
bad-faith
harassing
plaintiff.
"
and
the
statute
deals
with
that
category
of
person
and
no
other.
so
if
you're
not
a
bad-faith
harassing
plaintiff,
but
you
nonetheless
lost,
then
you're
under
54(d).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons.
one
is
symmetry,
because
they
have
costs
in
the
part
about
defendants.
and
the
concern
that,
well,
if
we
leave
out
costs
for
the
bad-faith
harassing
plaintiff,
then
it
--
it
may
be
assumed
that
they
get
only
attorney's
fees
and
not
costs.
so
the
statute's
provisions
like
this
may
be
redundant,
but
one
can
see
that
a
drafter
might
very
well
want
to
say,
"well,
we
said
we're
dealing
with
the
defendant
costs.
"
"we
want
to
put
the
same
thing
in
a
plaintiff.

justice

ms.
zieve,
when
i
look
at
other
statutes,
it
seems
to
me
we
would
want
to
look
at
statutes
involving
lenders,
so
we
would
look
at
the
truth
in
lending
act
and
the
--
what
is
it,
the
credit
organizations
act--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
those
do
not
provide
for
attorney's
fees.
they
are
covered
only
under
54(d),
which
is
costs,
not
fees.
why
should
we
read
this
act
in
a
way
that
--
so
--
so
that
a
defendant
under
this
act
who
can
get
attorney's
fees
is
worse
off
with
respect
to
costs
than
defendants
under
the
other
lending
legislation,
the
ones
that
have
only
54(d)?
congress
gave
defendants
something
more
here.
why
--
why
would
--
why
should
it
be
that
54(d)
would
apply
to
the
lender
under
the
truth
in
lending
act
but
not
to
the
lender
under
this
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
blatt,
we
do
have
in
this
case
the
views
of
the
government
regulators,
the
ftc
and
the
consumer
finance
protection
bureau,
and
we
have
heard
the
government's
position
on
the
relationship
between
these
two
provisions.
should
we
give
any
weight
to
the
interpretation
of
the
government
administrators?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
explain
why
we
would
look
to
other
rules?
you
wouldn't
look
at
the
rule
54(d),
and
we
might
look
at
rule
11
and
we
might
look
at
something
else?
i
thought
your
--
your
position
was
that
this
statute
governs
all
requests
for
fees
and
costs
under
this
particular
act.
