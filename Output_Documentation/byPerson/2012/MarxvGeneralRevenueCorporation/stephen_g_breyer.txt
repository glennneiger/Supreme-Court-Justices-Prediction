justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
my
problem
with
this
is
i
don't
--
i
mean,
i
read
the
whole
statute,
and
they
have
a
good
claim
until
i
think
you
read
the
whole
statute.
and
i
don't
know
what
to
say
other
than
the
impression
--
the
impression
is
that
subsection
3,
which
is
what's
at
issue,
the
whole
thing
is
meant
to
say
that
the
winner,
when
it's
the
plaintiff,
is
going
to
get
attorney's
fees.
you
know,
it
mentions
costs,
but
that's
the
background
rule.
and
then
when
you
get
to
the
second
sentence
of
that,
it
means,
and
if
you're
in
bad
faith,
the
plaintiff,
then
the
defendant
gets
attorney's
fees.
it
doesn't
really
mention
costs.
that's
the
background
rule.
so
--
and
i
look
at
the
legislative
history,
there's
some
staffer,
at
least,
who's
tried
to
find
that
interesting;
the
--
they're
talking
about
what
the
point
of
this
is,
and
say
the
whole
point
of
this
section
is
to
help
prevent
frivolous
suits.
well,
so
there
we
are.
that's
--
that's
where
i
am
at
this
moment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
on
some
technical
linguistic
basis,
it
may
do
that,
that's
correct.
but
perhaps
i'm
unique
in
this,
but
i
don't
just
look
at
the
language,
i
look
at
the
context,
i
look
at
the
purpose,
and
--
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
language
that
gets
rid
of
the
background
rule,
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
purpose
that
gets
rid
of
the
background
rule,
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
history
that
gets
rid
of
the
background
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
consequences
that
suggests
that
you
get
rid
of
the
background
rule.
i
don't
see
anything
in
our
traditions
that
says
you
should
get
rid
of
the
background
rule.
so,
what
do
you
do
with
some
obstreperous
judge
who
doesn't
just
look
at
the
language?
i
mean,
i
know
uses
it,
but
that's
not
the
only
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
why?
a
person
who
is
a
drafter
says,
you
know,
you
get
your
costs
and
you
also
get
the
attorney's
fees.
they
don't
--
they
don't
know
every
statute,
the
people
who
draft
this.
they
--
they
--
they
just
say,
senator,
what
are
we
trying
to
do?
he
says,
we're
trying
to
give
them
attorney's
fees.
they
say,
okay,
we'll
give
them
the
costs
and
the
attorney's
fees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
if
you
had
been
drafting
it,
perhaps.
but
the
people
who
actually
draft
these
things
are
a
whole
section
over
in
congress,
they
don't
know
every
statute,
and
you
give
them
a
general
instruction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
--
the
general
instruction
would
be
add
attorney's
fees
on
the
plaintiffs,
and
add
attorney
--
all
right.
you
understand
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
ignorance
of
other
laws.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right,
general
ignorance.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then
they
shouldn't
have
put
those
words
in.
we're
talking
about
the
next
sentence,
and
the
next
sentence
doesn't
put
the
words
in.
so
you're
--
you're
--
you're
assuming
from
that
fact
that
in
a
pro
defendant,
this
is
a
pro-defendant
provision
they
put
in,
that
was
their
whole
point
apparently
reading
it,
that
what
they
decided
to
do
is
take
away
from
defendants
costs
which
they
normally
get
without
saying
anything
about
it.
i
mean,
that's
--
you
understand
the
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
--
where
does
it
say
that?
where
was
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
would
like
to
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
look
up
--
did
you
try
to
do
any
sampling
on
that?
because
i
did,
actually,
and
--
and
i
discovered
something
that
i
think
is
not
as
strong
for
you,
but
it
isn't
too
much
against
you.
we
just
did
a
random
sample
of
28
successful
cases,
and
i
think
the
average
recovery,
except
for
one
outlier
where
it
was
very
high,
it
was
around
$4,000,
3
to
4,
and
the
average
costs
on
the
ones
that
the
defendants
won,
i
guess,
was
around
a
thousand.
so
you
have
a
point--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
it
isn't
quite
as
good
a
point
as
you
seem
to
suggest.
that
is,
it's
a
not
so
low
value
and
the
costs
are
not
so
high--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
order
to
make
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you're
right.
what
about
their
policy
argument
here,
that
you're
a
--
you're
a
potential
plaintiff,
you've
borrowed
a
lot
of
money,
you
don't
have
a
lot
of
money.
and
the
deal
is
this
under
your
interpretation;
if
you
win
you're
going
to
get
2
or
$3,000;
if
you
lose
it
will
cost
you
about
a
thousand.
that's
--
that's
under
your
interpretation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
under
theirs,
it's
if
you
win,
you
get
2
or
$3,000,
and
if
you
lose,
at
least
you
don't
lose
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
it
could
be
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
--
how
does
this
work,
the
canon?
i'm
very
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
very
interested
in
canons,
and
i
want
to
know
on
the
canon,
the
traditional
thing,
which
you've
probably
looked
up,
what
about
the
specific
governs
the
general?
is
it
--
how
is
that,
that's
an
old
canon
that's
been
around
a
long
time,
and
people
are
aware
of
it,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
is
--
seems
to
be
the
one
they
feel
is
very
important.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
well,
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
--
that's
a
different
matter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
she
says
if
i
--
if
i
tease
--
if
you
tease
your
sister,
i'm
going
to
give
you
--
give
her
your
allowance
and
her
allowance,
that
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
sister
loses
her
allowance
if
you
don't
tease
her.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
instances--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
you
put
the
“
and
”
in
and
it
doesn't
mean
that
that's
the
exclusive
place
for
giving
it.
sometimes,
it
does;
sometimes,
it
doesn't.
that's
her
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
doubt
that
it
does.
i
mean,
they're
human
beings
over
there;
they're
not
necessarily
all--
