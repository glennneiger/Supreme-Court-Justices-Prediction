justice
elena
kagan
ms.
blatt,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
the
most
natural
way
to
read
this
statute,
and
it's
not
--
it's
not
your
way,
it's,
look,
we
have
this
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
that
--
that
contemplates
that
congress
sometimes
doesn't
write
--
it
writes
statutes
authorizing
lawsuits
without
providing
a
cost
provision.
and
because
we
know
that
about
congress,
we
provide
a
default
rule.
and
the
default
rule
is
what's
laid
out
in
subsection
d
as
to
costs
and
then
also
later
as
to
attorney's
fees.
but,
we
know
that
congress
sometimes
does
address
costs
and
fees,
and
where
congress
in
a
particular
statute
has
addressed
costs
and
fees,
we
look
to
whatever
congress
has
said,
you
know,
unless
congress
has
otherwise
provided.
and
here
this
is
--
1692k
is
a
provision
that
addresses
costs
and
fees.
it
addresses
them
comprehensively
and
specifically.
justice
elena
kagan
i
expected
you
might.
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
it's
not
a
question
of
field
preemption.
justice
elena
kagan
maybe
i'm--
justice
elena
kagan
--not
in
the
business
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
congress's
intent
is.
all
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
whether
this
federal
statute
provides
otherwise,
and
this
federal
statute
does
provide
otherwise.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
both.
you
know?
justice
elena
kagan
and
if
i
might
say,
i
mean,
you
object
to
this
statute;
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
say
congress
should
have
written
a
separate
provision
about
costs
and
attorney's
fees,
but
for
whatever
bad,
good
or
indifferent
reason,
congress
didn't;
and
so
this
statute
basically
says,
here's
what
prevailing
plaintiffs
get
as
to
both
costs
and
fees;
here
is
what
prevailing
defendants
get--
justice
elena
kagan
--under
what
circumstances,
as
to
both
costs
and
fees,
and
those
are
the
rules.
justice
elena
kagan
this
statute
is
very
--
is
very
normal
if
it
were
just
about
fees,
right?
it
would
be
just
like
the
civil
rights
fees
statutes,
where
it
said
prevailing
plaintiffs
get
fees,
but
prevailing
defendants
only
get
fees
upon
some
higher
standard,
here
bad
faith.
what
makes
this
statute
different,
and
it
is
different,
is
that
this
statute
twice
says
not
only
fees
but
also
costs.
justice
elena
kagan
now
you
might
say
that's
very
uncommon,
but
in
both
sentences
it
says,
we
want
the
same
rule
for
costs
as
we
do
for
fees.
justice
elena
kagan
sorry.
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
say
that,
but
it
says
to
both.
it
says
the
costs
together
with
the
reasonable
attorney's
fees,
and
then
the
next
sentence
it
says
fees
and
costs.
so
you
might
wish
that
they
were
a
different
statute,
and
it
might
be
good
policy
to
have
a
different
statute--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
not
in
the
business
--
i'm
not
in
the
business
of
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
congress
is
doing.
i'm
in
the
business
of
just
reading
what
congress
did;
and
what
congress
did
is
it
created
a
set
of
rules
that
applies
to
attorney's
fees
and
costs
at
the
same
time.
justice
elena
kagan
that
sounds
very
terrible.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
blatt,
you
say
it
--
it's
supposed
to
make
defendants
better
off
by
focusing
on
just
part
of
the
provision,
but
the
provision
is
--
as
a
whole,
it
does
a
set
of
things.
it
treats
plaintiffs
and
prevailing
plaintiffs
in
a
certain
set
of
ways,
and
it
treats
prevailing
defendants
in
a
certain
set
of
ways.
justice
elena
kagan
prevailing
defendants,
but
when
--
prevailing
defendants
are
treated
worse
than
prevailing
plaintiffs,
because
they
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
bad
faith
lawsuit.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
blatt,
let
me
try
it
a
different
way.
justice
elena
kagan
let's
just
suppose
that
54(k)
didn't
exist
at
all.
justice
elena
kagan
54(d)
didn't
exist.
justice
elena
kagan
and
all
you
had
was
this
provision,
okay?
justice
elena
kagan
so
this
provision
says
on
a
finding
by
the
court
that
it's
brought
in
bad
faith,
the
court
may
award
to
the
defendant
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
so
suppose
a
defendant
wins,
but
there's
not
a
finding
that
it
was
made
in
bad
faith,
would
then
the
person
be
entitled
to
either
attorney's
fees
or
costs?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
saying
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--in
my
world,
you
would
not
get
fees
or
costs.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
just
asking
you
a
simple
question.
justice
elena
kagan
you
would
not
get
costs
under
that
provision.
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
if
you
would
not
get
costs
under
that
provision--
justice
elena
kagan
--under
1692,
a
provision
that
talks
about
fees
and
costs
generally
as
to
both
plaintiffs
and
defendants,
then
how
does
a
rule
that
says
what
--
where
you
would
get
costs
unless
a
federal
statute
provides
otherwise
change
matters?
justice
elena
kagan
you
might
be
right,
but
suppose
congress
wasn't
thinking
about
rule
54.
suppose
it
didn't
occur
to
the
drafters
what
rule
54
said
or
what
the
default
provision
was.
they
just
wrote
a
statute
about
fees
and
costs.
and
then
--
it
doesn't
really
matter
whether
they
were
thinking
about
rule
54
or
not.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
--
that's
just
a
different
way
of
saying
the
following:
the
first
sentence
says,
when
you're
a
prevailing
plaintiff,
you
get
costs
and
fees.
how
about
defendants?
well,
prevailing
is
not
enough
for
defendants.
defendants
have
to
show--
justice
elena
kagan
--that
the
suit
was
filed
in
bad
faith--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
then
they
get
costs
and
fees.
justice
elena
kagan
i
completely
agree
with
that.
but
that's
what
it
comes
down
to,
that
if
you
think
that
congress
has
to
use
super
extraordinary
language
to
over
--
to
--
to
get
out
of
54(d),
then
you're
right.
but
54(d)
doesn't
say
that.
it
just
says--
justice
elena
kagan
--unless
the
federal
statute
provides
otherwise.
justice
elena
kagan
i
understood
ms.
blatt
to
actually
agree
with
that,
that
if
you
put
rule
54
aside,
this
does
say,
"you
may,
under
a
certain
set
of
conditions.
"
which
implies
you
may
not,
under
--
if
those
conditions
are
not
met.
