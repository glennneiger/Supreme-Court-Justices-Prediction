mr.
cullen,
it's
often
true
in
international
litigation
that
enforcement
is
very
difficult.
i
mean,
take
a
commercial
litigation
case
where
somebody
is
going
after
assets
and
the
assets
are
not
in
the
united
states,
and
somebody
looks
and
says,
well,
you
know,
a
court
can
do
whatever
it
wants
but
nothing
is
going
to
happen
afterwards.
so
why
is
this
case
any
different
from,
you
know,
a
very
frequent
problem
in
international
litigation,
which
is
sometimes
judgments
are
difficult
to
enforce?
and
if
you
look
at
it
practically,
it
may
--
may
never
be
enforced,
but
we
don't
put
courts
to
the
job
of
saying,
oh,
well,
let's
check
out
the
various
enforcement
options
and
make
predictions
about
who's
going
to
do
what.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it's
different
--
that
might
be
--
it's
certainly
different
in
terms
of
the
interests
at
stake,
and
that
might
be
a
very
good
reason
for
congress
to
step
in
and
try
to
fix
this
system
so
that
you
don't
have
children
shuttling
back
and
forth.
but,
you
know,
at
the
risk
of
sounding
hard-hearted,
in
terms
of
the
law,
what
is
different?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
cullen,
may
i
ask,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
exactly
your
argument
is.
so
let
me
give
you
two
options,
and
you
tell
me
what
your
argument
is,
all
right?
one
--
you
can
tell
me
it's
neither,
i
suppose.
but
one
is
this
case
is
moot
because
there's
no
practical
way
to
enforce
any
relief
that's
ordered
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
all
right.
that's
what
i
came
in
thinking
your
argument
was.
the
second
is,
is
just
no,
it's
just
improper
for
the
eleventh
circuit
to
enter
any
order
granting
relief.
so
which
is
it?
is
it
the
it's
improper
to
enter
any
order
at
this
point,
or
is
it,
you
know,
you
can
enter
an
order,
but
it's
just
not
going
to
be
enforced,
and,
therefore,
this
case
is
moot?
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
understand--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
there
could
be
no
rereturn
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty.
so
this
is
an
argument
that
hangs
on
what
the
treaty's
terms
say;
is
that
correct?
