justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
you're
saying
is
the
return
of
the
child
essentially
back
to
alabama.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
once
the
child
is
back
in
alabama,
that's
the
remedy,
then
the
state
court
would
be
seized
of
jurisdiction
sufficient
then
to
determine
the
habitual
residence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
whatever
the
state
--
well,
presumably
the
child
only
comes
back
if
you
win.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
presuming
you
win,
the
child
would
come
back,
and
the
alabama
courts
could
then
seize
the
custody
determination.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
was
their
reasoning
that
the
child
was
initially
removed
properly
because
there
had
been
an
order
permitting
the
mother
to
go?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
was
a
lawful
removal
at
that
moment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
they're
saying
is,
since
the
case
is
moot,
nothing
has
vacated
the
order,
but
it
didn't
make
her
action
illegal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
a
stand-still
order
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
is
a
judgment
against
your
client,
isn't
there,
for
$94,000
or
so?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
break
down
that
figure?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
that
cost
that
you
have
to
pay
for
the
mother,
even
though
the
case
was
mooted,
that
judgment
is
still
outstanding
for
the
moneys
you
have
to
pay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
you
win
on
this
appeal,
is
that
wiped
out?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
what's
--
what
happens--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--can
you
tell
me
what's
happening,
what
is
the
status?
given
the
vacated
return
custody
order
--
return
order,
will
the
scottish
court
ever
determine
habitual
residence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
order
has
been
vacated,
so
can
they
revisit
that
question
is
really
the
--
the
issue.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
at
the
hague,
it's
what
was
it
then.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
ask
a
question?
does
it
matter?
meaning,
whether
a
stay
is
granted
or
not,
you
are,
i
don't
think,
taking
the
position
that
only
if
the
stay
is
granted
is
the
court
of
appeals
seized
of
jurisdiction.
you're
saying
the
case
is
not
moot,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
now,
under
the
convention,
if
the
child
--
if
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court
now
to
fashion
a
remedy,
it
could
order
return,
it
could
decide
under
the
convention
that
bringing
the
child
back
after
14
months
presents
a
great
risk
to
the
child
under
the
convention
and
not
order
the
return,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
we
just
don't
know
what
the
court's
going
to
do,
but
some
form
of
relief
is
possible.
that's
why
you
used
the
word
“
possible
”.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they
have
the
power,
if
they
choose
it,
but
they
don't
have
to
choose
it;
that's
the
bottom
line,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
aware
of
--
i
happen
to
be
because
i
know
this
area
very
well
--
the
english
courts
have
an
amici
filed
with
us
yesterday,
and
they
are
sort
of
sensibly
keeping
track
of
what
we're
doing
and
trying
to
adjust
their
proceedings
accordingly
and
in
the
manner
they
think
is
most
helpful
to
us.
whether
it
is
or
not,
i
can't
comment
on.
is
this
common
in
the
custody
area?
is
there
discussions
between
courts
about
what
they're
doing
and
the
why
of
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
it's
required.
there
is
a
whole
system
set
up
now,
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
can't
they
order
the
mother
to
come
back
with
the
child?
because
the
scottish
court
stops
her?
there
is
competing
orders
all
the
time.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
not?
she
was
here.
she
submitted
to
the
court's
jurisdiction.
doesn't
her
--
jurisdiction
over
her
now
continue
until
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
doesn't
matter.
the
question
is,
isn't
she
seized
--
doesn't
the
court
have
jurisdiction
over
her
until
the
case
ends?
the
case
doesn't
end
until
there
has
been
an
appeal
and
a
judgment
and
the
judgment
affirmed
or
reversed.
that
hasn't
happened.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
are
suggesting
that
the
convention
deprives
a
party,
after
the
remedy's
been
ordered
and
effected,
of
the
right
to
appeal;
not
because
of
mootness,
but
because
the
convention
takes
away
a
fundamental
right
to
appeal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
not
going
to
suggest
all
those
countries
that
permit
appeals
explicitly
and
stop
removals
until
appeals
are
finished,
that
those
--
that
those
those
treaty
--
contracting
treaty
parties
are
breaching
the
convention,
are
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
that
--
that
actually
is
not
accurate.
the
convention
is
full
of
conditions
for
the
return:
the
safety
of
the
child,
the
support
of
the
parent
who
is
returning
--
there
is
a
whole
set
of
conditions
that
have
to
be
met
before
the
child
is
returned.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
happen
to
think
that
one
could
argue
that
returning
back
to
the
court
that
had
--
was
making
the
decision
after
an
appeal
is
raised,
that
that's
an
inherent
condition
of
a
return
order.
but
that
--
you're
arguing
against
that,
but
there
are
plenty
of
conditions
that
could
be
imposed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
you
can't
--
the
court
can't
order
custody
issues,
but
it
can
set
conditions
for
the
nature
of
the
return.
it
could
say
the
father
pays
the
cost;
the
father
has
to
pay
for
certain
expenses
in
the
country
the
child
is
being
sent
to;
those
kinds
of
conditions
can
be
imposed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me,
can
i
just--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
asking
is
not
enough.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
the
mother
can
get
on
the
plane
the
moment
she
hears
that
someone's
asked.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
there
a
spanish
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
there
a
spanish
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
not
a
scottish;
spain,
a
case
from
spain.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
the
child
was,
in
fact,
returned
when--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
there
is
an
amici
brief
here
that
says
that
the
scottish
courts
will
not
pay
attention
to
the
habitual
residence
of
a
child
at
the
time
of
the
removal.
the
amici
brief
that
was
filed
with
us
yesterday,
if
i'm
reading
it
correctly,
suggests
that
the
court
believes
that
hasn't
been
settled
in
english
law;
is
that
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
that
--
so
that
proposition
is
not
as
settled
as
the
amici
suggests?
