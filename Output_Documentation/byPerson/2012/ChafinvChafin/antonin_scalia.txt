justice

scalia
wouldn't
the
alabama--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
alabama
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
if
the
child
had
been
wrongfully
removed?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
wait,
wait.
the
opinion
below
has
been
vacated.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
--
there's
nothing
which
says
that
this
child
--
this
child's
habitual
residence
was
--
was
in
the
u.k.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
being
the
case,
the
only
question
is
will
the
alabama
court
proceed,
even
--
assuming
that
it
finds
the
child's
habitual
residence
was
in
alabama,
would
it
proceed
even
if
the
child
had
been
taken
out
of
the
jurisdiction,
and
i
understand
that
it
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
hasn't
been.
it's
been
vacated.
it's
as
though
it
never
happened.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
bad
law.
i
mean
--
you
mean
the
alabama
court
is
bound
by
a
vacated
decision
of
a
federal
court?
my
goodness,
i
never
heard
of
anything
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
--
i
don't
understand
that
answer.
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
--
that
your
failure
to
appeal
that
in
a
timely
fashion
makes
it
impossible
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
obliterate
that
award?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
--
that's
what
i
thought
the
question
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
--
then,
retain
your
tunnel
vision.
and
don't
say
that
the
case
remains
non-moot
simply
because
of
this
other
issue.
the
other
issue
is
either
in
the
case
or
out
of
the
case.
now,
is
it
part
of
your
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that's
lovely,
but
--
so
you
are
saying
that
you
don't
have
to
appeal
that
separately;
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
got
to
answer
my
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
to
appeal
that
separately
or
not?
if
--
if
the
way
you
answered
justice
alito's
question
was
--
was
the
way
you
did,
you
are
saying
that
it's
unnecessary
to
appeal
that
monetary
aspect
of
the
judgment
separately,
that
it
goes
--
it
goes
with
the
rest
of
it.
is
that
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
saying
it
doesn't
have
to
be
appealed
separately.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
could
bring
a
hague
proceeding
there,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
say,
you
know,
there
having
been
no
decision
in
the
united
states,
we
want
you
to
decide
what
habitual
residence
is,
and
we
think
it's
in
the
united
states.
you
could
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
don't
know
it'll
make
a
difference
without
answering
those
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
want
us
to
--
to
say
it
may
make
a
difference,
and
that's
enough,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
should
put
it
that
way,
then.
it
doesn't
--
you
don't
know
that
it
makes
a
difference,
but
you
don't
have
to
know,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
lovely,
but
there
wasn't
a
stay
here.
so
what
do
you
do
when
that
procedure
hasn't
been
followed?
that's
the
issue
that
we're
presented
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
do
we
even
know
that
a
stay
would
have
been
appropriate
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
presumably
a
stay
would
not
have
been
appropriate.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
all
that's
very
nice.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
this
case?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
burden
is
different,
but
i
don't
agree
that
the
standard
changes.
it's
just
who
has
to
prove
it,
one
side
or
the
other.
but
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
he
had
said
the
same
thing,
that
the
reason--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
good.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
are
you
arguing
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
implementing
the
treaty,
which
uses
“
forthwith
”
and
all
of
this,
is
to,
in
effect,
require
that
unless
there
is
a
motion
for
a
stay
pending,
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
be
carried
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
think
the
--
the
mere
word
“
forthwith
”
in
the
statute
is
enough
to
alter
our
normal
process
of
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
saying.
