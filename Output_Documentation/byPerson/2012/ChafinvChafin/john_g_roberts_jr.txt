chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-1347,
chafin
v.
chafin.
mr.
manely.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
that
that
time
period
was
tolled,
the
period
that
she
was
in
scotland
would
be
tolled.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
saharsky.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
do
you
agree
with
your
--
with
the
petitioner,
just
reading
a
sentence
from
its
brief,
that
"mootness
requires
that
relief
be
impossible?
"
do
you
think
that's
the
right
standard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
this
court
--
court
has
always
said,
if
it's
an
article
3
inquiry
under
standing,
and
it
said
that
it's
not
supported
by
injury
that
is
speculative
or
conjectural.
it
seems
to
me
when
you
start
talking
about,
well,
the
scottish
court
might
do
this
or
the
alabama
courts
might
do
this,
that
--
that
sounds
pretty
speculative
and
conjectural.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
do
you
think
it's
--
i
mean,
i
know
you've
got
a
laundry
list
of
things,
but,
as
i
understand
it,
you
think
it's
enough
that
if
the
court
issues
an
opinion,
the
scottish
court
might
do
something
as
a
result
of
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
one
of
the
arguments,
maybe
it
was
the
petitioner's
and
not
yours,
was
that
one
reason
it
wasn't
moot
is
because
the
scottish
courts
might
look
at
the
case
differently.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
cullen.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
thing
--
one
thing
the
court
can
do
is
give
him
back
$94,000.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
has
no
--
his
ability
to
challenge
the
propriety
of
the
order
that
he
pay
$94,000
is
gone?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
quite
fair
to
say
we
haven't
decided
whether
we're
going
to
appeal.
i
mean,
the
--
the
stay
motion
was
made
immediately
upon
the
determination
of
the
merits
by
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
said
no.
so,
i
mean,
didn't
they
do
everything
they
could
have
done
to
--
to
get
a
stay?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
out
of
respect
to
the
district
judge,
who's
just
issued
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
i
mean,
saying,
you
know,
we
have
to
consider
your
--
your
ruling;
not,
you
know,
we're
taking
you
up
right
away.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me,
and
i
may
be
taking
the
opposite
position
from
one
of
my
colleagues,
but
the
--
the
best
thing
is
to
hold
things
up
briefly,
so
that
the
child
doesn't
go
overseas
and
then
have
to
be
brought
back,
particularly
if
you
have
situations
where
there
can
be
an
expeditious
appeal.
and
i
think
most
appellate
courts
would
appreciate
the
--
the
benefit
of
that.
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
--
if
you're
correct
that
the
decision
is
moot,
it's
not
going
to
be
a
--
there
is
going
to
be
a
rush
to
judgment
by
the
individual
that
wants
to
take
the
child
away.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
everything
turns,
under
your
view,
on
whether
or
not
the
district
court
gives
the
losing
party
the
48-hour
stay
or
whether
the
mother
in
this
case
decides
to
stay
in
the
united
states
until
the
u.s.
proceedings
are
done.
the
incentives
if
you
prevail
are
for
the
custodial
or
the
parent
with
control
over
the
child
to
leave
immediately.
even
after
a
motion
has
been
filed
--
if
a
motion
for
a
stay
has
been
filed,
that's
not
a
stay.
get
on
the
first
plane
out
and
then
you're
home
free.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
unfortunate
result.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
know.
but
the
point
is
that
the
other
side
says
that
the
decision
was
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and,
you
know,
most
--
not
most,
but
many
district
judges
don't
like
to
immediately
say
after
they
have
issued
a
decision,
well,
there
is
a
good
likelihood
that
i'm
wrong,
and
therefore,
i'll
issue
a
stay.
[laughter]
so
there
has
to
be
at
least
a
period
before
somebody
can
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
get
a
stay,
and
if
you're
right,
what's
happening
during
that
48
hours
or
24
hours
is
that
the
parent
with
control
of
the
child
is
trying
to
find
the
first
flight
out
and
once
she
does,
it's
all
over.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
manely,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
sounds
awfully
speculative
and
conjectural.
that
doesn't
sound
--
whether
you're
analyzing
it
under
standing
in
the
first
instance
or
mootness
later,
that
doesn't
sound
to
be
the
sort
of
concrete
injury
that's
required.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
11-1347,
chafin
against
chafin.
this
case
involves
an
international
child
custody
dispute,
but
the
question
we
resolve
today
is
not
which
parent
gets
custody
of
the
child.
it
is
instead
whether
an
american
court
still
has
jurisdiction
in
the
case
when
the
child
in
question
has
been
taken
out
of
this
country
and
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
court
could
do
anything
about
it.
the
united
states
has
signed
a
treaty
known
as
the
hague
convention
on
international
child
abduction.
if
there
is
a
custody
dispute
between
parents
in
different
countries,
that
treaty
generally
provides
that
the
custody
will
be
determined
in
the
child's
--
and
this
is
a
term
of
art,
country
of
habitual
residence.
if
one
of
the
parents
has
taken
the
child
away
from
that
country
or
prevented
the
child
from
returning
to
it,
the
other
parent
can
get
an
order
directing
that
the
child
be
returned.
jeffery
chafin
is
a
member
of
the
u.s.
military.
when
he
was
stationed
in
germany
in
2006,
he
married
a
scottish
woman
by
the
name
of
lynne
hales.
together,
they
had
a
daughter
whom
we
will
call
e.c.
short
time
later,
mr.
chafin
was
sent
to
afghanistan
and
ms.
chafin
took
e.c.
to
scotland.
when
mr.
chafin
came
back
to
the
united
states,
specifically
alabama,
ms.
chafin
and
e.c.
eventually
came
to
join
him,
but
the
marriage
degenerated
and
mr.
chafin
filed
for
divorce
in
alabama
court.
as
those
proceedings
went
on,
ms.
chafin
was
deported.
she'd
overstayed
her
visa
and
e.c.
remained
in
alabama
with
mr.
chafin.
but
then
ms.
chafin
filed
suit
in
federal
court
asking
the
judge
to
order
that
e.c.
be
returned
to
scotland
pursuant
to
the
hague
convention.
ms.
chafin
came
back
to
the
united
states
for
a
hearing,
at
the
end
of
which,
the
district
court
ruled
that
e.c.'s
country
of
habitual
residence
was
indeed
scotland
and
that
ms.
chafin
could
take
her
back.
ms.
chafin
and
e.c.
got
on
a
plane
headed
to
scotland
within
hours.
mr.
chafin
appealed,
but
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
his
case
as
moot
because
e.c.
was
in
scotland,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
it
was
powerless
to
grant
mr.
chafin
any
remedy
even
if
he
were
to
win.
the
district
court
then
ordered
mr.
chafin
to
reimburse
ms.
chafin
for
her
attorney's
fees
and
travel
expenses
to
the
tune
of
$94,000.
now,
the
constitution
tells
us
that
federal
courts
may
only
adjudicate
real
cases
or
controversies.
federal
courts
do
not
engage
in
empty
gestures,
but
so
long
as
it's
possible
for
a
court
to
grant
some
effectual
relief,
there
is
still
a
case
or
controversy
and
the
case
is
not
moot.
here,
it
is
possible
for
courts
to
grant
effectual
relief
to
the
winner.
mr.
chafin
seeks
an
order
that
e.c.
be
return
to
the
united
states.
ms.
chafin
argues
that
he
will
not
win
on
that
claim,
but
that
argument
goes
to
who
is
right
on
the
merits.
the
mootness
issue
is
whether
if
mr.
chafin
is
right,
any
court
order
remedy
would
be
effective.
now,
on
that
point,
ms.
chafin
argues
that
mr.
chafin's
requested
remedy
would
not
be
effective
because
scotland
would
ignore
any
u.s.
order
that
e.c.
be
sent
back,
maybe.
but
u.s.
courts
have
the
power
to
order
people
who
have
appeared
before
them
to
take
certain
actions
even
if
they
are
outside
the
country
and
courts
can
back
up
those
commands
with
sanctions.
so,
an
order
that
e.c.
be
return
to
the
u.s.
would
bind
ms.
chafin
and
she
might
decide
for
a
variety
of
reasons
to
comply.
she
might
refuse
to
comply
of
course,
but
that
does
not
make
this
case
moot.
courts
can
issue
orders
even
though
it
is
unclear
whether
they
will
result
in
actual
relief.
for
example,
a
court
can
order
a
person
to
pay
damages
of
$100,000
even
though
that
person
is
broke.
as
long
a
decision
could
have
some
impact,
as
long
as
the
person
might
be
able
to
pay
something
someday,
the
case
is
not
moot.
now,
mr.
chafin
also
wants
the
order
that
he
pay
ms.
chafin
$94,000
overturned.
again,
ms.
chafin
argues
that
mr.
chafin
will
not
succeed
because
he
did
not
separately
appeal
that
order,
but
that's
beside
the
point.
remember,
for
mootness
purposes,
we
ask
whether
if
mr.
chafin
succeeds,
the
relief
ordered
will
be
effectual,
it
would
be.
relief
in
the
form
of
not
having
to
pay
$94,000
would
not
be
entirely
satisfactory
to
mr.
chafin.
his
daughter
would
remain
in
scotland.
but
$94,000
is
$94,000
and
it's
enough
to
keep
the
case
alive.
for
these
reasons,
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
dismissed
this
case
as
moot.
instead,
it
should
have
decided
it.
we
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
below
to
do
just
that.
our
opinion
ends
by
noting
how
important
it
is
that
these
cases
be
decided
as
quickly
as
possible.
the
best
interest
of
the
child
demand
that
custody
proceedings
begin
promptly
and
nothing
about
our
ruling
today
prevents
that,
quite
the
opposite.
we
think
that
if
these
cases
did
become
moot
between
trial
and
appeal,
courts
might
grant
stays
in
virtually
every
case
holding
up
the
effectiveness
of
their
opinion
to
prevent
parties
from
loosing
any
right
to
appeal,
but
then
children
would
loose
precious
months
when
they
could've
been
readjusting
to
life
in
their
country
of
habitual
residence.
instead,
we
think
courts
should
carefully
balance
several
factors,
including
the
best
interest
of
the
child
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
grant
stays
pending
appeal
and
courts
should
take
every
effort
to
decide
these
cases
as
quickly
as
possible
so
that
stability
can
be
returned
to
the
lives
of
these
children
and
their
parents.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
scalia
and
breyer
joined.
