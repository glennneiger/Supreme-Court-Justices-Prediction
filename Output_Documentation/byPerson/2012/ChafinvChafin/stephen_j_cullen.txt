mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
chief
justice,
the
effect
that
any
appeal
court
could
give
would
be
zero
in
the
scottish
court,
nothing.
there
is
nothing
a
court
can
do
in
this
judicial
process--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--which
--
well,
they
can't,
first.
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
they
cannot.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
well,
the
case
did
end
because
there
is
one
remedy,
and
one
remedy
only,
in
this
treaty,
and
that
is
return.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
no.
that's
not
correct.
i
can't
agree
with
that
because
then
we're
ignoring
article
3
and
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
mootness,
because
that's
where
the
constitutional
doctrine
comes
into
central--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--no.
the
convention
says
you
must
exercise
the
most
expeditious
remedies
available
because--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--no.
they're
not.
there
are
88
countries,
and
this
is
a
very,
very
good
convention.
it
works.
it
works
for
the
countries,
justice
sotomayor,
that
do
immediate
enforcement,
and
it
works
for
the
countries
that
don't
do
immediate
enforcement
pending
an
appeal.
but
the
question
presented
here
is
what
a
court
could
do
in
this
country
once
the
sheriff
court
in
the
hamlet
of
airdrie
is
seized
with
jurisdiction.
because
what
this
treaty
has
done
is
has
taken
jurisdiction
from
the
united
states
and
said,
scotland,
you
now
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
no,
it
cannot.
it
cannot.
i
was
very--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--it's
gone
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
in
the
joint
appendix,
pages
16
and
17,
you'll
see
--
i
believe
it's
docket
entry
52
on
page
16,
an
appeal
was
taken
off
those
fees.
if
you
go
on,
i
believe
it's
page
17
of
the
joint
appendix,
docket
entry
57,
you'll
see
that
the
petitioner
voluntarily
dismissed
his
appeal
of
the
fees.
so
having
taken
an
appeal
of
the
fees
and
having
dismissed,
there
is
nothing
left
for
any
appeal
court
now
to
do
with
respect
to
fees.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
right.
so--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--right.
but
the
test
that
the
court
would
apply
in
that
hypothetical
fees
determination,
is
totally
different
from
the
test
the
appeal
court
would
apply
in
looking
at
habitual
residence.
all
it
would
look
at
is,
is
it--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--right.
so
if
we
assume
that
the
fees
survives
--
they
can
pursue
the
fees
issue.
the
problem,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
there
--
there
is
no
habitual
residence
to
be
determined
back
in
time.
what
this
treaty
does
is
it
exercises
a
one-way
return.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
well,
the
premise,
though,
is
based
in
the
purpose
of
this
treaty,
because
back
in
the
'70s
before
this
treaty,
justice
kennedy,
there
was
chaos,
and
in
fact
the
government
is
suggesting
we
should
go
back
to
possibly
competing
custody
orders
between
scotland
and
alabama,
but--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--with
--
justice
breyer,
with
respect
to
the
lower
court's
opinion,
there
is,
as
justice
ginsburg
said
there
is
no
opinion.
there
is
nothing.
there's--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--justice
breyer,
the
sheriff
in
airdrie
would
say,
why
are
you
handing
me
a
finding
about
what
habitual
residence
was
2
years
ago?
the
child's
habitual
residence
2
years
later
is
clearly
scotland,
and
we
--
we
don't
look
back
in
time
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
justice
ginsburg,
that's
correct.
justice
breyer--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--justice
breyer--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--well,
with
respect
to
custody
law
versus
hague
law,
justice
kennedy,
there
--
there
is
a
difference.
the
relevance
of
the
hague
determination
2
years
in
the
past
is
not,
justice
breyer,
helpful,
but
i
agree.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
but,
justice
breyer,
if
--
we
say,
as
you
know,
you
can't
have
conditional
returns,
but
you
can
have,
with
respect
to
stays,
there
is
a
panoply
of
different
types
of
stays.
now,
what's
happened
in
the
district
court
in
this
instance--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--justice--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--we
don't
--
we
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
sotomayor.
there
are
affirmative
exceptions
that
can
be
asserted
by
a
respondent,
but
there
are
no
conditions;
in
fact,
article
19
of
the
treaty,
as
you
know,
says
you
cannot,
as
a
hague
court,
step
into
any
sort
of
custody
determinations
at
all.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
those
would
be
limited
undertakings.
as
you
know,
justice
sotomayor,
those
limited
types
of
undertakings
came
about
because
of
the
13b
exception
and
the
13b
exception
only,
where
a
judge
felt
there
was
some
risk
in
the
return
but
the
risk
did
not
rise
to
the
great
risk.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
justice
kagan,
not
to
state
the
obvious,
but
this
is
different
because
it's
a
child.
it's
a
child
question,
and
that
has
to
be
a
consideration
in
this
treaty.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
well,
what
is
different
is
--
and
i
need
to
answer
the
question
--
two
justices
have
asked
me
about
these
stays,
and
i
need
to
answer
that
so
i
can
answer
your
question.
the
--
the
district
court
was
presented
with
a
single
request
for
a
stay
in
this
case.
the
request
was
we
may
or
may
not
file
an
appeal.
we
haven't
filed
a
notice
of
appeal,
so
give
us
a
stay
so
we
can
decide
what
we
want
to
do.
what
should
have
happened
and
what
usually
happens
is
you
say,
give
us
a
stay,
but
if
you're
not
going
to
give
us
a
stay,
give
us
a
temporary
stay.
give
us
48
hours
to
see
if
we
can
get
a
stay
from
the
appellate
court.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
no.
it
was
a
peculiar
halfhearted
request
for
a
stay.
the
stay
was
we
don't
even
know
if
we're
going
to
appeal
this.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
right.
and
this
was
a
wednesday.
and
what
should
have
happened
is,
at
a
minimum,
a
24-hour
or
48-hour
request
for
a
temporary
stay.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
happens
all
the
time
in
hague
cases.
hague
practitioners
ask
for
stays,
and,
if
a
stay
is
not
going
to
be
granted,
ask
for
a
temporary
stay.
the
notion
presented
to
this
court
that
there
was
some
rush
to
justice
here
is
not
what
happened
on
the
ground
in
alabama.
that
is
not
what
happened.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
no,
we
don't
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
that
doesn't
take
account
of
the
four
factors
any
district
court
judge
is
supposed
to
exercise
in
her
discretion
in
determining
whether
a
stay
should
be
granted
or
not.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
justice
kennedy,
no,
what
we're
doing
is
we
are
following
the
letter
and
the
text
of
the
convention
and
the
implementing
legislation
in
this
country.
time
and
again,
this
peculiar
word
“
forthwith
”
is
used.
it
means
right
now.
time
and
again,
the
treaty
tells
us
you
must
act
expeditiously
because
the
idea,
justice
kennedy,
is
we
avoid
competing
litigation
in
countries.
we
must
have
one
country
that
is
deciding
this.
and
it's--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
it's
the
--
as
a
treaty,
it's
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
it
says,
if
you
decide
to
issue
a
return,
the
child
is
to
be
returned
forthwith.
and
the
plain
meaning
of
those
words
is
you
must
act
immediately.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
justice
breyer,
it's
not
that
we
enter
into
these
communications
and
agreements
with
any
country.
by
ratifying
this
particular
treaty
and
by
the
united
states
saying,
we
are
going
to
ratify
it
with
the
united
kingdom
or
scotland
or
brazil,
we
are
saying
much
more
than
there's
no
comity
here.
we
are
saying
we
trust
this
other
country
to
do
the
right
thing.
and
that's,
justice
breyer,
why
we
lodged
the
scottish
papers,
because
the
scottish
papers
should
satisfy
you
that
scotland
was
very
satisfied
there
was
a
valid
return.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
but
it
doesn't
matter,
justice
breyer,
because
there's
been
a
vacatur.
there
is
no
underlying
decision.
the
child
is
back
in
scotland,
and
now
one
court
can
proceed.
and
in
fact,
by
continuing
--
justice
breyer,
by
continuing
the
litigation,
the
effect
of
that
is
to
undermine
the
treaty,
because
the
idea
behind
the
treaty,
particularly
for
military
families,
was
to
enable
mobility.
and
by
having
ongoing
litigation
in
the
united
states,
the
only
thing
we
can
guarantee
this
court
is
this
child
is
not
coming
to
america
until
the
litigation
is
over.
so
now
we're
talking
two,
three,
four
years.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
justice
kagan,
i'm
going
to
take
your
third
non-offered
offer.
and
the
answer
is
because
the
constitution
tells
us
there
is
no
case.
we
cannot
--
we
cannot
--
and
i
see
justice
alito--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--because
--
because
article
3
says
we
have
to
be
able
to
grant
some
effectual
relief
in
the
judicial
process.
and
since
the
mills
case
in
1895,
right
up
to
the
knox
case
this
year,
this
court
has
always
said
it's
effectual
relief
in
this
judicial
process.
so
i
have
to
pose
the
question,
justice--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--it
is
a
mootness
question
because
it
goes
--
it's
not
--
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
constitutional
mootness.
it
goes
to
the
issue
of
this
may
be
uncomfortable,
and
this
may
be
inconvenient;
but,
once
we've
effected
a
remedy
--
the
only
remedy,
justice
alito,
under
this
treaty
--
and
once
it's
been
carried
out,
and
once
that
child
is
home
in
scotland,
no
matter
what
another
court
does
in
this
judicial
process,
it
can
have
no
effect
on
the
scottish
custody
proceeding--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--there
can
be
no
rereturn.
there
was
a
lawful
order
returning
the
child
to
the
jurisdiction
of
scotland.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
well,
it
is
--
it
is
very
textual,
which
is,
of
course,
what
surprised
us
so
much
in
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
because
as
you
know,
justice
kagan,
the
last
time
the
government
presented
this
position,
they
said
exactly
the
opposite
in
janakakis.
now,
they
tried
to
deal
with
this,
justice
kagan,
in
this
footnote
in
their
brief
saying,
well,
we
touched
briefly
on
this
point
before.
they
didn't
touch
briefly
on
it.
they
said
in
absolute
terms
that
nothing
in
the
convention
--
so
this
is
our
government
talking
about
the
text,
and
we
may
give
some
compelling
deference
to
--
to
the
government
on
text,
but
we
don't
give
any
deference
to
them
we
say
or
what
the
founding
fathers
meant,
but
with
respect
to
this
janakakis
case,
the
government,
said
nothing
in
the
convention
requires
courts
or
other
authorities,
and
this
was
in
greece,
to
give
binding
effect
to
any
judgment--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--i
would
say
it
is
the
point
because
the
convention
says
it's
the
point.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
the
convention
says
you
look
to
the
place
where
the
child
was
located
immediately
prior
to
the--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--well,
habitual
residence
being
fact
and
law--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--right?
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
you
look
to
1895,
you
look
to
the
mills
decision,
and
the
mills
decision
that
tells
you,
under
article
3,
a
case
is
moot
when
the
issues
presented
are
no
longer
live
and
the
parties
lack
a
legally
cognizable
interest
in
their
--
if
the
live
issue
of
habitual
residence
18
months
ago
is
dead.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
agree,
and
here's
why.
we
don't
agree
because
initially
the
district
court
judge
did
not
order
the
instantaneous
departure
of
this
child.
she
only
did
that
after
considering
the
motion
to
stay.
it
was
not--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--and
it's
--
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
it
is
all
over
once
--
once
the
doors
close
on
that
plane
and
that
child
arrives
back
in
scotland,
unless
the
plane
turns
round
and
comes
back
again,
it
is
all
over.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
yes,
justice
alito.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
well,
the
beckier
case
goes
to
mills
and
relies
on
church
of
scientology
and
mills--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--well,
this
is
the
--
this
is
what
makes
constitutional
mootness
uncomfortable
because
it's
an
answer
that
justices
and
judges
typically
don't
want
to
hear.
but
it
is
the
answer.
the
question
is
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
done.
the
one
remedy
has
been
effected,
justice
alito,
and
what
--
what
brings
all
this
into
sharp
contrast
now
is
what
we
lodged
last
week.
the
petitioner,
justice
alito,
himself
is
fully
participating
in
the
scottish
proceedings.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
right.
and
there
would
be
a
problem,
justice
alito,
if
we
didn't
have
the
motion
to
stay
concept,
if
we
didn't
have
all
of
the
alternatives
for
district
courts
to
enter
different
types
of
motions
to
stay.
what
--
what
at
least
will
happen
from
the
chafin
case,
i'm
sure,
will
be
everyone
will
know
that
you
need
to
ask
for
a
motion
to
stay,
everyone
will
know
you
need
to
ask
for
different
types
of
motions
to
stay--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--well,
ask--
mr.
stephen
j.
cullen
--the
mother
can
get
on
the
plane
when
she
is
allowed
to
get
on
the
plane,
and
in
this
particular
case,
probably
because
she
had
to
come
in
under
humanitarian
parole,
there
was
considerable
urgency
in
this
case.
and
it
was
a
very
young
child,
and
the
scottish
court
was
ready
to
beseize
the
jurisdiction.
why
would
judge
johnson
not
do
what
the
treaty
was
telling
her
to
do?
get
the
child
back
to
scotland.
i
found
habitual
residence
in
scotland,
and
let's
let
scotland
move
forward.
