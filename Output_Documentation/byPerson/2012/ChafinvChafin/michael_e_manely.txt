mr.
michael
e.
manely
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
united
states
courts
have
the
power
to
effectuate
relief
in
the
hague
convention
cases
under
circumstances
presented
here
in
this
international
treaty.
sergeant
first
class
--
first
class
chafin's
appeal
from
the
district
court's
decision
is
not
moot
because
reversal
of
the
district
court's
judgment
could
grant
sergeant
chafin
relief
in
three
ways,
each
sufficient
to
preclude
mootness.
first,
a
reversal
would
mean
that
the
united
states
is
the
child's
habitual
residence;
second,
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals
should
order
ms.
chafin
to
bring
the
child
back
to
the
united
states
and
overturn
the
monetary
award;
and,
third,
it
would
effectuate
relief
in
the
ongoing
alabama
case
and
the
scottish
case
by,
one,
letting
alabama
courts
proceed
to
determine
custody
and,
two,
cause
the
scottish
court
to
stay
or
dismiss
its
proceeding.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
uccjea,
which
is
what
the
state
of
alabama
would
use,
there
is
a
home
state
requirement
that
the
child
must
be
presently
--
six
months
before
the
action
is
commenced.
not
so
much
from
the
district
court
order,
but
coming
down
from
the
alabama
supreme
court,
but
premised
upon
the
original
district
court
order,
it
was
determined
that
alabama
was
not
the
home
state
of
the
child.
so
it's
sort
of
like
the
traffic
light
that
we
talk
about
in
our
brief.
it
would
allow
the
alabama
courts
to
say--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--yes.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
it
would
toll
because
the
child,
we
would
argue,
is
wrongfully
in
scotland
based
upon
an
errant
district
court--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--except
for
the
fact
that
there
is
an
error
in
the
determination
of
habitual
residence.
and
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
the
--
the
res
of
the
controversy
needs
to
be
brought
back
here.
that
--
that
would
be
the
appropriate
remedy
here,
so
that
we
have
not
only
the
habitual
court
--
or
habitual
residence
determination
in
the
district
court
because
of
reversal,
but
that
we
have
the
child
brought
back
here.
and
then
that
six--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--yes,
your
honor.
i
understand.
what
our
argument
is,
is
that
there
is
an
ability
to
grant
a
remedy
here,
and
that
is
the
reversal
of
that
determination,
so
that
we
go
back
to
habitual
residence
in
the
united
states.
that's
what
avoids
mootness
in
this
case.
there
is
a
remedy
that
can
be
provided
here.
it
is
not
impossible.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
bring
the
child
back.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
right.
proceed
under--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--the
alabama--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--no.
the
alabama
court
would
have
jurisdiction
under
the
uccjea
presently,
unless
this
court
should
determine
that
it
is
moot
when
a
child
is
removed
from
the
boundaries
of
our
--
of
our
nation.
the
alabama--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
if
there
never
had
been
a
district
court
determination
in
the
first
place,
certainly--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--the
posture
below
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit
vacated
the
opinion
in
february;
but,
as
recently
as
july
of
this
year,
the
alabama
supreme
court
said,
well,
since
the
matter
was
determined
moot,
then
only
the
divorce
can
proceed.
what
we
hope
to
do
is,
by
going
back
down
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
obtaining
a
reversal--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--yes,
sir.
it
goes--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--yes.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
at
that
moment,
yes.
and
by--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--correct.
and
by
reversing,
then
we're
going
back
to
what
was
argued
to
make
the
case
moot
in
the
first
place.
we
can
bring
the
child
back,
and
we'll
reverse--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--the
mother--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--yes,
your
honor.
absent
--
and
she
was
present
at
the
trial
in
the
district
court.
so
there
are
provisions
that
would
allow
her
to
return
for
that
particular
reason.
and,
of
course,
she
can
reapply,
i
think,
after
something
like
five
years.
she
was
deported
because
she
had
overstayed
her
visa.
but--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--the
order
of
the
court
in
scotland,
we
would
refer
to
on
a
state
level
as
being
a
standing
order.
and
what
it
does
is
tell
sergeant
first
class
chafin
that
he
can't
remove
the
child.
there
is
no
prohibition
to
the
mother.
there
is
no
sense
that
scotland
has
assumed
authority
over
this
child,
should
become
a
ward
of
the
country.
it's
more
that
since
the
mother
has
filed
a
custody
action
there,
it's
a,
dad,
you
can't
remove
the
child
from
scotland.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
october
13th
of
last
year,
i
believe,
so
approximately
14
months
now.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
the
alabama
courts--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
again,
applying
uccjea,
which
all
of
the
states
have
but
for
one,
they
are
to
look
at
hague
orders
in
the
same
way
that
they
would
apply
uccjea,
and
there
is
a
tolling
provision.
if
a
child
has
been
wrongfully
removed
from
that
jurisdiction,
then
the
child
is
still
presumed
to
have
retained
a
home
state
status
with
alabama.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
the
lion's
share
of
it
is
attorney's
fees,
but,
also,
within
the
hague,
there
is
a
mandatory
provision
for
costs;
not
just
costs
of
court,
but
the
costs
of
mother's
flying
over
here
from
scotland,
staying
here
for
approximately
a
week
and
a
rental
car.
so
while
that
isn't
the
predominant
share
of
the
$94,000,
it
was
a
substantial
portion
of
that.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
neither,
your
honor.
where
they
are
is
the
trial
level
court
is
waiting
to
grant
a
divorce,
but
that
is
kind
of
effectively
held
up
by
the
parties
in
hoping
that
we
can
use
alabama
rule
of
civil
procedure
60(b)(5);
that
if
we
get
a
reversal
from
the
eleventh
circuit
saying
habitual
residence
is
the
united
states,
we
can
reopen
the
custody
matter.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
certainly,
if
the
eleventh
circuit
reverses,
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
it
still
is,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
we
believe
that
it
is.
the
energy
of
our
case
is
thrust
into
having
habitual
residence
determination
reversed
and
bringing
the
child
back;
but,
we
think
that
when
--
the
provision
of
icara
that
allows
for
the
costs,
the
travel
costs
and
the
attorney's
fees
to
be
awarded,
is
also
obliterated.
so
that
is
also--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--it's
a
separate
order,
same
case.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
we
don't
think
so,
but,
again,
that's
not
the
thrust
of
our
case.
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
and
we
certainly
agree
with
that.
our
energy
all
along
has
been
spent
exclusively
on
reversing
habitual
residence
determination.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
your
honor,
i
believe
i
understand
your
question,
and
i
--
and
i
think
you're
correct.
if
we're
talking
about
a
determination
that
the
united
states
loses
power
over
children
when
they're
removed
from
our
borders,
then
the
rest
kind
of
falls
in
line.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
no,
sir.
and
it
may
be--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--i
apologize.
and
it
may
be
just
the
--
the
tunnel
vision
that
we
have
in
this
case.
we're
solely
focused
on
reversing
the
district
court
order
on
habitual
residence
and
returning
the
child.
the
rest
is--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--we
agree
with
the
government's
position
that
it
keeps
this
case
alive,
and
it
is
not
moot.
but
i
certainly
understand
the
issue,
particularly
since
our
focus
on
the
case
is
otherwise.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes,
your
honor.
i
agree.
and
the
--
allowing
the
child
to
leave
was
the
linchpin
that
allowed
the
costs.
removing
that
impediment
also
removes
the
costs.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
i'm
saying
i
trust
that
that
is
the
resolution
of
this;
but,
again,
our
focus
is
on
the
child,
not
costs.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yeah.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
is
correct
that
if
the
--
the
basis
for
the
award
is
removed,
then
the
award
is
removed;
but,
if
the
basis
for
the
award
remains,
then
it
would
be
difficult
to
assert
that
there
is
some
reason
to
appeal
that
award.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
great
answer.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
the
scottish
court
has
no
need
to
determine
habitual
residence
because
that
was
determined
by
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
i
don't
--
they
wouldn't
revisit
within
the
context
of
a
hague
proceeding
unless
a
hague
proceeding
were
brought
there.
within
the
context
of
their
own
custodial
determination,
like
the
alabama
court
would
in
the
divorce,
there
is
a
determination
of
--
of
jurisdiction
over
the
child.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
we
could
bring
a
hague
proceeding
there.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
we
could
do
that.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
we're
talking
about
different
points
in
time.
for
our
hague
--
actually,
his
mother's
hague
proceeding,
she's
the
one
that
filed
it
--
for
the
mother's
hague
proceeding,
the
time
period
that
we're
looking
at
was
february
of
2010
until
the
child
left
in
october
of
2011.
that
is
the
time
frame
we'd
really
like
to
stay
with.
that's
an
important
time
frame.
if
we
go
to
scotland,
we're
talking
about
a
different
time
frame.
it's
a
different
animal.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
from
a
united
states
perspective,
more
specifically
an
alabama
perspective,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
yes.
and
--
and
the
scottish
court
--
our
--
our
briefs
are
filled
with
the
citations
of
authority,
but
the
scottish
court
--
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
scottish
court
wouldn't
honor
what
the
united
states
court
has
said
about
habitual
residence,
the
case
brought
by
the
mother
in
the
federal
district
court
in
alabama.
so
that
if
that
was
the
linchpin
to
allow--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--yes.
custody
is
the
second
and
crucial
element
of
the
hague
convention
as
well.
if
--
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
thank
you,
your
honor.
with
that,
i'd
like
to
touch
on
four
points:
first
of
all,
these
courts
have
inherent
authority
to
order
the
child
be
brought
back.
it
is
a
way
of
reversing
the
wrong
decision
of
the
district
court.
when
we
are
talking
about
the
object
of
the
convention,
it
is
in
part
rapid
return,
but
that
is
kind
of
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
the
critical
issue
is
where
is
the
appropriate
habitual
residence
of
the
child,
and
that
is
the
place
that
then
needs
to
make
the
custodial
decision.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
i
think
that
may
well
be
his
argument.
i
disagree
with
it
entirely.
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
courts
are
quite
used
to
having
children
have
to
transfer
from
one
place
to
another.
the
closest
case
on
point
i
can
think
of--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--your
honor--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--there
no
cases
because
we
don't
run
into
this
problem,
quite
frankly.
and
--
and
re-return
is
a
catch
phrase
that
was
created
here.
bringing
the
child
back
would
be
a
part
of
the
court's
inherent
authority,
part
of
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals'
inherent
authority,
and
it's
the
basis
upon
which
scotland
has
the
child
in
the
first
place.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
e.
manely
there
is
a
scottish
custody
case
pending--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--a
spain
--
a
spanish
case,
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
the
child
was
sent
to
poland
based
upon
the
trial
court's
decision
in
that
case,
and
the
child
returned
from
poland
based
upon
the
supreme
court
of
spain's
decision
in
that
case.
so
there
is
a
confusion
between--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--well,
i
don't
know
ultimately
if
the
child
was
returned
from
poland,
so
much
as
the
supreme
court--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--except
that
we
never
have.
i
mean,
this
is
a
fairly
young
convention,
we
haven't
had
it
that
long,
but
we
never
have
had
that
problem
before.
it's
been
easy
enough
--
ohlander
v.
larson
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
is
a
great
case
to
look
at
for
where
the
united
states
has
been
very
giving
in
sending
children
back.
we
have
not
had
this
problem
before.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
that's
my
reading
of
it
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
e.
manely
correct.
i
think
they
are
waiting
to
see
what
--
what
we
want
to
do.
so
you've
got
villamonte
v.
marquez,
where
the
issue
there
is
it's
not
moot
because
it's
possible
an
extradited
person
could
one
day
voluntarily
return,
so
it's
not
moot.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
preventing
the
mother,
who
filed
the
case
before
the
district
court
and
is
still
a
party
to
the
case,
from
voluntarily
returning.
that
enough
is
--
is
enough
to
survive
this--
mr.
michael
e.
manely
--the
concrete
injury
has
to
do
with
the
habitual
residence
determination
in
the
district
court,
which
switches
if
the
appellate
court
reverses
and
grants
habitual
residence
here
and
orders
the
child
be
brought
back.
that
is
the
concrete
interest.
