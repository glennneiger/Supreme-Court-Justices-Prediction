ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
put
simply,
this
case
is
not
moot
because
an
appellate
decision
on
the
merits
would
matter.
what
the
court
has
been
discussing
today
is
there
are
various
ways
in
which
the
appellate
decision
might
matter.
there
are
ways
that
there
would
be
a
judgment
that
the
father
either
did
or
did
not
wrongfully
retain
the
child.
part
of
the
wrongful
retention
determination
is
the
900
--
or
the
$94,000
in
money
damages.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
the
child
might
remain
in
the
uk
or
be
brought
back
to
the
u.s.
and
then
there's
the
question
of
which
courts
are
going
to
decide
custody,
alabama
or
scottish
courts.
and
we
don't
need
to
know
precisely,
and
this
court
doesn't
need
to
figure
out
all
of
the
different
details
of
alabama
state
law
or
of
custody
law
under
the
scottish
proceedings.
all
the
court
needs
to
decide
is
that
the
appellate
court's
decision
would
make
a
difference
here.
and
it's
--
it's
just
not
the
case
that
you
could
say
it's
moot
because
it
doesn't
make
a
difference.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
i'm
glad--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
this
court
has
said
that
as
long
as
there's
any
possibility
of
effectual
relief,
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
so--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
what
i
would
say
is
that
you
don't
have
to
know.
but
just,
if
there
is
nothing
else
but
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
father
either
did
or
did
not
wrongfully
retain
the
child
in
the
u.s.,
that
is
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
world
that
has
consequences
to
these
parties.
it
has
consequences
in
terms
of
the
money
judgment
that's
been
entered,
and
it
has
consequences
in
terms
of
where
custody
will
be
determined.
the
whole
point
of
bringing
a
hague
convention
case
is
to
get
the
child
in
the
place
of
habitual
residence,
so
that
those
courts,
under
their
own
law,
can
decide
custody.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
we
share
your
concerns
about
not
wanting
the
child
to
be
shuttled
back
and
forth.
and
we
think
that
the
way
to
accommodate
those
concerns
are
by
stays
in
appropriate
cases,
where
the
four
factor
test
that
--
with
respect
to
a
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
and
a
balancing
of
the
equities
is
met;
and,
that
when
stays
are
put
in
place
pending
appellate
proceedings,
that
those
proceedings
be
expedited,
the
decisions
made
quickly.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
that's
what
we
would
say,
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
able
to
go
forward
with
the
case.
but
if
the
case
for
a
stay
has
not
been
made
by
the
losing
party,
then
the
child
should
be
returned
to
the
country
of
habitual
residence
because
a
determination
has
been
made
that
that's
the
country
where
the
child
should
be,
and
there's
not
a
good
argument
that
the
other
side
has
put
forth
for
a
stay.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
we
think
that
just
under
the
normal
court
appellate
rules,
that
that
effectively
is
what
happens
using
the
american
stay
standard
for
a
four
factor
test;
not
that
there
would
be
a
stay
in
every
case,
but,
when
the
showing,
the
appropriate
four
factor
showing
is
made
for
a
stay,
that
then
a
stay
would
be
appropriate,
and
an
expedited
appeal
would
be
appropriate.
but
you
can't--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
exactly
right.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
the
district
court
denied
a
stay,
and
petitioner
did
not
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
so
we
don't
know--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
then,
if
that's
the
case,
but
--
but
it
--
but
this
decision
actually
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
merits.
it
would
be
up
to
the
district
court
on
remand
to
determine
how
to
fix
its
prior
erroneous
decision.
and
it
would
use
the
equitable
authority
that
it
has
in
every
case
to
fix
a
wrong
decision
and
determine
what
the
right
thing
is.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
and
the
district
court
entered
a
brief
order;
so,
the
district
court
did
not
go
through
the
various
factors,
but
presumably
that
is
the
standard
the
district
court
would
have
used.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that's
exactly
right.
the
mootness
question
and
the
stay
questions
are
two
separate
questions.
and
you
don't
want
to
have
to
say
the
person
has
to
get
a
stay
in
every
single
case;
otherwise,
their
case
becomes
moot.
they
lose
their
appeal.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
we
don't
think
the
convention
addresses
that;
but,
the
district
court
could
make
that
determination
using
its
equitable
discretion.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
that
is
exactly
--
that
is
exactly
our
position.
we
don't
know
what
the
courts
would
do.
we're
glad
to
discuss
the
possibilities
with
the
court;
but,
the
standard
is
the
possibility
of
relief,
it
doesn't
need
to--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--that's
exactly
right.
the
position
of
the
other
side
is
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
the
courts
can
do
in
these
circumstances
once
the
child
leaves.
and
we
just
think
that
the
convention
doesn't
say
that.
it
doesn't
mandate
that.
it's
a
question
of
u.s.
mootness
law.
and
this
court
has
said
as
long
as
there's--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
in
the
convention,
there
is
kind
of
two
aspects
of
this.
one
is
in
child
custody
proceedings,
under
the
uccjea,
and
one
is
in
the
context
of
the
convention.
the
uccjea,
which
deals
with
competing
states
and
potentially
competing
countries'
custody
determinations,
has
specific
provisions
that
address
cooperation
and
communication.
they
are,
like,
section
110,
111,
and
112--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there
is
a
whole
system
for
that.
in
the
convention,
that
type
of
comity
and
cooperation
typically
occurs
through
the
central
authorities.
each
country
has
a
central
authority
that
communicates
with
each
other.
so,
for
example,
if
the
uk's
central
authority
would
like
something
to
be
brought
to
the
u.s.
court's
attention,
it
might
enlist
the
help
of
the
u.s.
central
authority
in,
for
example,
getting
the
parties
to--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
the
question
is
just
what
--
what
might
happen
in
this
case
in
terms
of
if
there
would
be
competing
court
orders
or
whether
the
courts
would
--
what
the
courts
would
do
in
response
to
each
other.
and
i
think
the
point,
at
least,
that
i
was
getting
from
justice
sotomayor's
question
is
that
there
is
a
measure
of
cooperation
here,
so
that
the
court
need
not
be
particularly
concerned
about
parallel
proceedings
or
competing
proceedings
in
other
countries.
the
way
that,
for
example,
this
case
has
played
out
is
that
while
the
hague
convention
dispute
has
been
litigated
in
federal
court,
the
alabama
custody
court
has
appropriately
stayed
its
hand,
as
it's
required
to
do
under
article
16
of--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
we
--
we
think
that
the
court
essentially
said
that
in
knox,
that
it
said
--
that
asked
whether
there
is
a
possibility
of
relief,
if
the
question
is
one
of
literal
impossibility,
we
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to
ask--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
made
those
comments
more
in
the
context
of
the
standing
inquiry
at
the
beginning
of
a
case,
as
opposed
to
the
mootness
inquiry
after
a
case
has
gone
on
for
a
while,
and
the
burdens
there
are
different.
at
the
standing
--
at
the
beginning
of
a
case
in
the
standing
inquiry,
the
party
coming
into
court
really
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
this
case
--
that
there's
something
to
be
adjudicated
in
court.
as
the
case
continues,
it's
the
party
who
doesn't
want
the
case
to
be
in
court
anymore
to
show
that
there's
nothing
the
court
can
do;
that
even
though
the
court
has
put
those
resources--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
and
our
position
with
respect
to
the
standard
is
simply
from
language
taken
from
this
court's
decision,
going
back
to
mills,
but
also
repeated
in
church
of
scientology
and
knox,
is
there
any
effectual
relief,
whatever;
is
it
possible
to
grant
relief?
relief
can
be
partial,
it
doesn't
need
to
be
complete.
that's
things
that
the
court
has
said.
you
know,
we
don't
interpret
that
to
be
a,
you
know,
literal
impossibility
standard.
we
just
understand
that
to
be
asking
the
question,
is
there
something
the
courts
can
do,
even
if
it's
not
complete--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
i
think
that
the
court
issuing
an
opinion
has
effects
in
america,
regardless
of
what
happens
in
scotland,
because
you
have
a
declaratory
judgment
that
sets
out
the
rights
of
the
parties.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
that's
--
i
think
it's
a
set
of
interrelated
reasons.
i
mean,
they're
really
all
connected
because
--
can
i
finish
the
sentence?
you
have
a
judgment
in
the
united
states
about
the
rights
of
the
parties.
it
affects
the
money
judgment.
it
affects
what
might
happen
with
custody.
i
mean,
it's
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
dispute.
thank
you.
