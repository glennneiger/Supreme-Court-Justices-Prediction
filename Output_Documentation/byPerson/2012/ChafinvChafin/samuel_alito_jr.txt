justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
alabama
courts
were
to
conduct
a
custody
proceeding?
since
the
child
has
now
been
in
scotland
for
over
a
year,
would
they
consider
the
child's
habitual
residence
to
be
scotland?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
they
did
that,
wouldn't
they
defer
to
the
scottish
courts
for
custody
determination?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
you
--
if
you
could
take
an
appeal
and
got
a
reversal
of
the
decision
--
of
the
order
removing
the
child
to
--
allowing
the
child
to
be
removed
to
scotland,
wouldn't
that
undermine
the
--
the
judgment
for
costs?
i
don't
understand
why
that
would
be
a
separate
order,
why
that
would
be
something
that
has
to
be
appealed
separately.
why
wouldn't
that
be
included
with
the
final
order
in
the
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
then
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
if
the
--
if
the
law
does
not
permit
the
issuance
of
a
particular
kind
of
order,
and
that's
what
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
--
or
that's
what
the
appellant
is
seeking,
then
the
case
is
moot.
is
that
your
argument?
that's
a
merits
question,
not
a
mootness
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
kagan,
your
argument
is
dependent
on
the
proposition
that
under
the
convention
that
once
the
child
has
left
this
country,
a
u.s.
court
no
longer
has
any
power
to
order
the
child
to
come
back;
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
i
don't
see
where
that
was
decided
either
by
the
court
in
this
case
or
in
the
beckier
case
that
the
eleventh
circuit
panel
here
cited.
there
is
no
discussion
in
either
of
those
opinions
of
the
--
how
the
convention
--
what
the
convention
says
on
this
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no,
no.
this
is
not
a
--
this
is
not
a
question
about
our
general
standard
of
mootness.
this
is
a
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
convention.
as
i
understood
your
argument
to
justice
kagan,
your
position
is
dependent
on
a
particular
interpretation
of
the
convention.
and
i
don't
see
any
discussion
of
that
interpretive
issue
in
either
of
those
opinions.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
convention
said
explicitly
that
a
court
in
this
country
or
whatever
other
sending
countries
involved
could
order
the
child
back,
this
case
would
not
be
moot;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
you
--
but
you
say
that
the
convention,
in
effect,
says
exactly
the
opposite;
once
the
child
leaves,
there
can't
be
an
order
requiring
their
return.
