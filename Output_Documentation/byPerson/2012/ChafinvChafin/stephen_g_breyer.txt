justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
that's
--
you've
won
a
judgment
in
lower
court
that
says
that
the
habitual
residence
of
the
child
is
scotland.
so
if
they
appeal,
they
might
win
one
that
says
that
was
wrong,
the
habitual
residence
was
the
united
states,
but
the
child
is
in
scotland.
you
understand
scottish
law
better
than
i,
but
they
are
also
bound
by
this
treaty.
so
i
would
imagine
a
scottish
court,
just
as
we
would
do,
when
they
are
trying
to
decide
what's
the
habitual
presumptive
then,
and
now
what's
the
habitual
residence;
they
would
look
at
what
the
united
states
courts
decided.
they
are
not
absolutely
bound
by
it.
but
just
as
we,
in
the
last
case
we
had,
were
very
interested
in
what
the
chilean
courts
said.
of
course
it
was
relevant
to
us
what
the
chilean
courts
had
held
was
the
proper
law
of
chile
in
respect
to
that
child.
wouldn't
the
scottish
courts
do
the
same?
wouldn't
it
matter
to
the
scottish
courts,
after
all,
that
an
american
court
had
decided
that
the
residence
was
not
bound?
i'd
certainly
give
it
--
wouldn't
they
give
it
consideration?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
assuming
they
win.
the
reason
that
they
want
to
appeal
is
they
want
to
win.
if
i
were
looking
at
the
case
as
you
present
it,
i
would
say,
of
course
you'll
win.
don't
worry.
what
are
you
worried
about?
but
--
but
they
have
a
different
view.
so
they
think
they
are
going
to
win.
now,
it
means
nothing
if
they
lose.
but
if
they
win
on
appeal,
they
then
have
their
order
that
says
that
this
child's
habitual
residence
was
the
united
states.
and
my
question
is
where
we
started,
armed
with
that
piece
of
paper,
they
walk
into
the
scottish
court
and
they
say,
oh,
scottish
judge,
please
read
this
paper.
of
course,
he
will
read
it,
and
i
would
think
that
that
judge
would
take
it
into
account
in
his
decision.
that's
what
we
do
with
the
foreign
--
similar
foreign
orders
of
other
foreign
courts,
and
i
think
we
should
do
that
and
i
think
the
scottish
courts
should
and
will.
now,
you
tell
me
where
i'm
wrong
in
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
--
then
argument
as
to
why
they
shouldn't
give
in
to
this
hypothetical
american
judgment.
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is
won't
they
consider
it
and
give
it
--
and
the
scottish
courts,
to
my
knowledge,
are
not
so
narrow-minded.
i
think
they
would
pay
attention
to
what
other
courts
have
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
or
wrong?
i
want
to
know
if
i'm
right
or
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
would?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
thank
you
for
justice
ginsburg's
answer.
she
is
quite
helpful.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
there,
but
i
didn't
understand
it
as
fully,
and
now,
i
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
unless
there
is
some
accommodation
here,
what
worries
me
is
this.
if
you
win
this
case,
it's
not
going
to
be
better.
maybe
for
your
client
it
will
be,
but
for
others
in
your
position,
it's
not
going
to
be
better.
and
what's
worrying
me,
to
put
it
on
the
table
so
you
can
respond,
is
that
in
similar
situations
district
judges
will
think
this
child
belongs
in
england;
this
child
belongs
in
france;
this
child
belongs
in
china,
wherever
they
belong;
but
in
the
back
of
their
mind
will
be
the
possibility
that
they
are
wrong,
and
they
know
there
is
a
right
to
appeal.
and
so
instead
of
being
able
in
these
border
cases
--
borderline
cases,
instead
of
being
able
to
send
the
child
back
home,
they
will
think,
i've
got
to
keep
the
child
here
so
that
the
other
party
has
the
right
to
appeal.
now,
it
seems
to
me
in
general
that
would
be
bad
for
the
child.
it
would
be
--
and
it's
bad
for
our
system.
and
it
would
be
better
to
work
out
a
system
that
you
can
send
the
child
back,
and
then
if
you're
reversed
on
appeal,
it
does
matter
to
the
other
country's
courts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
can't
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
want
a
treaty
where
the
best
interests
of
the
child
is
what's
at
issue,
and
you
interpret
it
in
a
way
that
the
court
of
one
nation
with
the
child
where
you
have
parents
from
both
nations
pays
no
attention
at
all
to
what
courts
in
other
nations
are
saying.
i
mean,
my
experience
out
of
that
is
chile,
where,
of
course,
we
wanted
to
know
what
the
law
of
chile
was
and
how
the
chilean
domestic
relations
judge
understood
the
relations
between
the
parents.
that
was
important.
and
similarly,
i
think
the
scottish
judge
should
want
to
know
the
same
thing
about
the
courts
deciding
in
the
united
states.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
united
states
judge
wanting
to
know
about
scotland
and
so
forth.
i
don't
see
how
we're
going
to
get
harmony,
in
other
words,
unless
you
let
appellate
processes
go
forward,
too.
and
--
and
i
don't
know
what
the
treaty
drafters
would
have
had
in
mind
if
they
wanted
some
other
regime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
trust
scotland
to
do
the
right
thing.
and
i
think,
to
help
scotland
do
the
right
thing,
it
would
be
nice
for
scotland
to
know
what
american
judges
have
decided.
that's
all.
and
the
reverse
is
equally
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
does
equate
but
now
you've
got
me
--
i
think
i'm
on
the
same
wavelength,
and
i
think
it
was
back
just
as
well,
let
me
see
because
justice
ginsburg,
i
see
the
point
of
her
answer
now.
it's
really
fact-specific
to
this
case
that
you're
talking
about.
so
it
just
happens
that
the
child
has
now
been
in
britain
or
in
scotland
for
18
months.
and
so
the
question
of
current
habitual
residence
where
they
have
been
there
for
18
months
is
a
question
of
what's
been
happening
over
these
18
months,
and
what
happened
before
the
18
months
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
and
the
most
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
say
is
that
it
was
resident
in
america
18
months
ago
and
that's
no
more
relevant
than
saying
that
the
cow
jumped
over
the
moon
or
some
other
thing.
is
has
--
is
that
the
point,
is
that
the
point?
is
that
the
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
the
point
--
yes,
that
is
the
point.
okay.
if
that's
the
point--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
the
convention
doesn't
know
whether
it's
18
months
or
6
months
or
what
counts
as
habitual
residence,
does
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true
but
you
have
to
decide
whether
that's
the
habitual
residence,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
adding
a
factual
thing,
that
what
happened
in
18
months
earlier
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
child
is
now
an
habitual
resident
of
scotland.
and
what
i
want
to
know,
and
i'm
not
going
to
find
this
in
the
treaty,
i
don't
think,
because
it's
not
going
to
say
whether
it's
11
months
or
12,
but
i
want
to
know
what
source
i
look
to,
to
show
that
you're
right
and
that
what
happened
18
months
previously
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
child's
habitual
residence
as
of
the
place
where
he
has
lived
for
18
months.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yours
is
fact.
i
want
to
know
what
i
look
to,
to
find
out
that
fact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
he
says
is
that
after
18
months
in
scotland,
the
scottish
court
will
decide
where
is
the
habitual
residence
of
the
child.
we
are
now
in
august
of
year
2.
and
what
happened
before
january
of
year
one
is
now
totally
irrelevant.
so
even
if
the
american
courts
decided
prior
to
january
of
year
1
the
correct
habitual
residence
was
alabama,
when
the
scottish
courts
decide
what
is
his
habitual
residence
as
of
18
months
later,
they
won't
pay
any
attention
at
all
to
that
american
decision
because
it
is
not
relevant.
that,
i
take
it,
to
be
his
argument,
which
depends
on
the
long-time,
18
months.
so
what
is
your
response?
