justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
have
the
state
proceedings
been
dismissed?
or
are
they
in
suspense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
would
be
your
position
that
the
alabama
courts
still
have
jurisdiction
over
the
child
and
the
mother?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
you
go
further
and
say
that
if
a
stay
is
not
in
place,
that
that
still
does
not
deprive
the
court
of
appeals
of
jurisdiction
to
resolve
the
case
on
the
merits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
he
might
have
assumed
that
the
issue
of
fees
would
still
be
alive
if
the
eleventh
circuit
ruled
on
the
merits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
he
--
he
was
just
trying
to
have
a
single
appeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
appellate
courts
all
the
time
have
issues
where
they
apply
different
standards
to
multiple
issues
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
of
course
--
on
your
premise
that's
right.
on
their
premise
it's
wrong,
that
--
the
issue
of
custody
is
still
alive
under
their
perspective.
that's
what
we
are
arguing
about,
so
you're
just
assuming
your
own
premise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
am
--
i
am
quite
surprised
that
you
would
say
that
prior
residence
can
never
bear
on
present
residence.
in
custody
disputes
this
happens
all
the
time.
the
child
spent
5
years
in
this
country,
4
years
in
that
country;
now
for
the
last
2
years
the
child
has
been
in
this
country
--
the
previous
experience
of
the
child
has
a
tremendous
bearing
on
custody.
to
say
that
it's
only
now,
prospective
only,
after
the
child
has
been
removed,
i
just
think
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
custody
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
again,
you're
just
assuming
that
the
district
judge
is
right,
but
that's
the
whole
issue.
and
as
the
chief
justice
indicates,
under
your
position,
we
give
a
premium
to
the
very
sort
of
precipitant
action
that
the
hague
convention
is
designed
to
avoid.
