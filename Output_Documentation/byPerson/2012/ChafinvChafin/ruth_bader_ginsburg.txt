justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
it
make
any
difference?
once
the
decision,
the
district
court
decision
is
vacated,
then
the
state
court
can
go
forward.
there
is
nothing
that
inhibits
it
from
doing
so.
there
is
no
federal
court
order.
so
your
third
point,
i
think,
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--now,
i
don't
understand
that.
the
child
is
now
in
scotland.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
would
these
six
months
be
satisfied?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
can
argue
that
on
the
basis
of
the
vacation
of
the
district
court's
hague
convention
order.
you
--
you're
not
inhibited
by
anything,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
that
the
federal
court
has
done.
since
it's
been
vacated,
it's
as
though
it
never
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
have
--
you
don't
have
the
individual
--
the
residence
--
habitual
residence
determination
because
it's
been
wiped
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
bring
the
child
back,
there's
an
impediment
to
that
because
now
this
court
in
scotland
has
told
her
don't
--
the
child
stays
here.
there's
an
order
that
the
child
not
be
removed
from
scotland,
and
there
is
also
--
doesn't
the
mother
have
--
wasn't
this
mother
deported?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
she
--
she
--
if
she
--
the
mother
comes
back
into
the
united
states,
she's
committing
a
criminal
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
order
of
the
court
in
scotland?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
long
has
the
child
been
--
now
since
the
return
pursuant
to
the
federal
court's
order,
how
long
has
the
child
been
residing
in
scotland?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
done
in
a
separate
judgment?
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
is
there
any
problem
about
the
time
to
appeal
from
that
having
run?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
far
as
mootness
is
concerned,
if
you
have
not
appealed
from
that
order
and
the
time
has
run
from
your
appeal,
you
can't
rely
on
that
to
avoid
mootness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
scotland,
it's
--
it
would
be
a
custody
proceeding.
forget
about
the
hague.
the
child
is
there.
the
mother
is
bringing
a
custody
proceeding.
and
the
question
for
that
court
is
where
is
the
child's
habitual
residence
now?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
only
for
determining
the
hague
convention;
and,
if
the
hague
convention
is
out
of
it,
then
there
is
a
custody
proceeding.
the
idea
of
the
hague
convention
is
just
to
get
the
case
to
a
forum
that's
an
appropriate
forum
to
decide
the
custody
question,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
saharsky,
not
to
--
i
mean,
the
whole
object
of
the
hague
convention
is
to
stop
this
shuttling
the
child
back
and
forth.
but,
because
of
this
unfortunate
situation
we
have
where
the
district
judge
wouldn't
give
a
stay,
you're
--
what
you're
--
what
you're
urging
is
exactly
what
this
convention
was
meant
to
stop.
this
child
has
been
in
scotland
for
14
months.
now,
you
say
bring
it
back
to
the
united
states,
and
we
start
over.
the
whole
object
of
the
return
procedure
is
so
that
you
get
the
child
to
a
place
that's
a
proper
place
to
determine
custody;
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
agree
that
the
ideal
--
the
ideal
procedure
would
be,
and
i
quite
agree,
that
you
have
a
very
fast
track
stay
pending
appeal
and
an
expedited
appeal.
but
there
is
no
rule
that
--
that
requires
that,
so
how
--
how
could
that
sensible
procedure
be
put
in
place?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
wouldn't
go
back
to
what
shouldn't
have
happened,
that
is,
the
district
judge
applying
the
four
factor
test
--
or
did
the
district
--
there
was
an
application
for
a
stay.
it
was
denied,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
--
i
think
you're
--
you're--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
--
we
have
a
brief
in
--
in
the
case
telling
us
that
the
question
justice
breyer
is
posing,
would
they
look
at
it;
they
would
say
it's
irrelevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
what
her
habitual
residence
was
then
doesn't
matter
one
whit
to
us.
we
want
to
know
where
she
is
residing
now,
and
that's
the
reason
why
the
scottish
court
would
say
it's
not
relevant
to
the
question
before
us.
their
question
is
not
a
treaty
question.
their
question
is
custody
of
this
child.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cullen,
are
you
saying
that
the
--
under
the
treaty,
there
can
be
no
rereturn
order?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
whether
the
--
whether
the
return
order
was
wrong
or
right,
there
can
be
no
rereturn?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
convention
was
to
cut
that
out.
that's
the
whole
reason
for
the
convention,
that
they
wanted
to
stop
the
shuttling
of
children.
do
you
--
are
you
aware
of
re-return?
your
--
your
thesis
is
that
the
--
that
now
the
court
of
appeals
could
tell
the
district
judge,
you
were
wrong.
and
then
the
father
armed
with
that
can
go
and
get
a
re-return
order
from
the
scottish
court
under
the
convention.
have
there
been
instances
under
the
convention,
was
this
question
of
re-return
--
is
re-return
authorized
assuming
that
there
was
a
valid
return
order,
at
least
valid
when
it
was
entered
and
when
the
child
was
returned--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
is
the
incidence
of
re-return
under
the
hague
convention?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
the
child
returned,
or
was
it
just
a
decision
that
the
appeal
could
not
be
avoided?
was
the
child
returned
by
poland?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
--
see,
that's
the
whole
problem
is
that
you
--
you're
going
to
have
rival
decrees
of
two
countries,
which
is
what
--
exactly
what
the
convention
was
meant
to
avoid.
