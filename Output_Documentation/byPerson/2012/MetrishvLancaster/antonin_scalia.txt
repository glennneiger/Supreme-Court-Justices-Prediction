200
years?
did
you
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
--
i
would
have
thought
your
--
you
can
get
to
your
second
one,
but
i
would
have
thought
your
first
response
to
--
to
the
question
would
have
been
to
deny
that
you
say
it's
clear
because
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
has
said
so.
i
thought
your
argument
is
it's
clear
because
it's
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
okay.
it
should
have
been
your
first
point.
the
premise
is
simply
wrong.
you're
saying
it
was
clear
because
the
statute's
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
would
have
been
able
to
raise
it.
there's
a
lot
of
question
about
whether
it
would
have
been
successful,
because
if
it
had
gone
up
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
--
the
statute
was
in
effect
during
his
first
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
have
raised
it,
but
if
it
went
up
to
the
michigan
supreme
court,
it
would
have
had
the
same
result
as
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
only
--
your
only
defense
would
have
been,
oh,
it's
a
great
surprise.
but
i
don't
see
how
it's
a
surprise
if
the
michigan
law
has
been,
as
--
as
the
solicitor
general
of
michigan
has
described
it,
that
--
that
there's
a
clear
tradition.
if
--
if
the
statute
addresses
the
area,
the
courts
will
not
--
will
not
supplement
it
by
--
by
common
law
additions.
did
he
not
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
it
was
firmly
--
do
you
--
do
you
contest
the
--
the
assertion
by
the
solicitor
general
that
there
is
no
case
which
--
which
acknowledged
and
held
the
defense
of
diminished
capacity?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--lets
the
defendant
off
on
the
basis
of
diminished
capacity?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
case
has
a
holding,
a
holding
that
diminished
capacity
excuses
the
crime
or
mitigates
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
--
is
that
correct?
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
supreme
court
have
done
that
if
it
--
if
it
thought
that
at
least
--
at
least
it
was
arguable?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mogill,
as
--
as
i
understand
your
burden
here,
it's
--
it's
not
enough
to
show
that
michigan
law
seemed
to
be
what
you
--
what
you
say
it
was;
but
it
has
to
have
been--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
you
say
it
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
--
there
was
an
evulsive
change
by
the
supreme
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
--
it's
hard
to
believe
that,
given
--
given
the
clear
text
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
--
if
a
prosecutor
raised
that
objection
knowing
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
--
would
reverse
the
exclusion,
right
--
i
mean,
it's
clear
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
done,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
once
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
it
and
said
the
trial
was
infected
with
that
error,
could
--
could
the
defendant
be
retried?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
he's
--
he's
convicted
and
the
--
i'm
sorry
--
he's
--
he's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
he
be
retried?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
--
then
you
would
be
crazy
to
raise
it
as
a
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could
get
an
--
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
--
how
often
was
it
mentioned
in
intermediate
court
opinions?
justice
antonin
scalia
four
mentions
in
the
supreme
court
that
say
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
held
that
a
state
law
has
been
determined
to
be
x
simply
because
intermediate
state
courts
have
uniformly
held
it
to
be
x?
never
mind
assumed
it
to
be
x;
have
held
it
to
be
x?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
mean
it's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
show
it's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it's
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
he
contested
that.
i
think
he
never
went
further
into
it,
but
he
seemed
to
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
where
there
is
a
michigan
statute
it
can't
be
supplemented
by
the
common
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
rely
on
reese
as
establishing
the
principle
that
you
cannot
supplement
the
defenses
in
a
criminal
statute,
but
reese
was
a
2012
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
you'd
need
a
case
in
which
the
prosecutor
was
pretty,
pretty
clear
that
a
diminished
capacity
defense
would
prevail.
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
--
the
game
wouldn't
be
worth
the
camel,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
us
to
say
“
yet
again
”
when
we
write
our
opinion?
