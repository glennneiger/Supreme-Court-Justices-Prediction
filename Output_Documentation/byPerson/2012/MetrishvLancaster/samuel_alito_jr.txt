justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
we
don't
--
well,
we
don't
really
have
to
reach
this
issue
in
this
case,
according
to
your
submission,
but
what
would
happen
if
a
state
--
an
intermediate
state
appellate
court
said
the
law
is
such-and-such,
and
then
a
--
a
person
is
tried
in
the
interim,
is
tried
and
subsequently,
the
state
supreme
court
says
that
intermediate
state
court
decision
was
incorrect,
that
never
was
the
law
of
this
state;
the
law
was
exactly
the
opposite.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
wondering
is
how
we
even
get
beyond
the
statement,
the
holding
by
a
state
supreme
court
regarding
the
--
the
law
of
the
state.
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
as
the
--
as
the
law
of
the
state?
isn't
that
what
our
decision
in
fiore
says?
if
the
state
supreme
court
says
this
is
the
law
and
it's
always
been
the
law,
then
how
can
we
second-guess
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
griffin
--
you
describe
griffin
in
your
brief
as
follows:
"the
court
vacated,
reversed,
and
remanded
the
decision
below
based
on.
"
quote,
"defendant's
claim
that
trial
counsel
was
ineffective
for
failing
to
explore
defenses
of
diminished
capacity
and
insanity.
"
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
“
and
insanity
”.
so
it
wasn't
specifically
--
wasn't
limited
to
diminished
capacity.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
was
insanity
in
general.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
unfairness--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
is
the
unfairness
here?
do
you
think
there's
a
reliance?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
--
so
what
is
the
unfairness
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
the
question
can
be
whether
there
was
a
change
in
michigan
law,
because
we
can't
second-guess
the
michigan
supreme
court
about
what
michigan
law
was.
michigan
law
is
whatever
the
state
supreme
court
says
it
was.
we
might
agree,
we
might
disagree.
so
i
think
we
have
to
start
from
the
proposition
that
the
law
didn't
change,
because
that's
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
said.
so
there
must
be
some
other
ex
post
facto
principle
that
applies
when
there's
a
certain
type
of
unfairness.
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
articulate
what
that
principle
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
you're
--
what
you're
arguing
is
that
under
certain
--
in
evaluating
certain
constitutional
claims,
the
--
the
question
of
what
state
law
is
is
not
dispositive.
i
don't
think
you're
arguing
that
a
federal
court
has
a
right
to
tell
a
state
court
what
state
law
is.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
suppose
this
were
a
diversity
case.
can
--
can
a
federal
court
say,
you
know,
we
--
we
think
that
the
--
the
decisions
of
the
intermediate
state
supreme
court
were
correct
and
this
new
decision
by
the
state
supreme
court
is
incorrect,
so
we're
not
going
to
follow
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it's
not
--
it's
not
this
case,
because
there,
you're
trying
to
figure
out
what
state
law
is.
here
you're
applying
a
constitutional
principle.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what
is
that
--
that
gets
me
to
the
second
part
of
my
question.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
the
--
the
constitutional
principle
that
doesn't
depend
on
what
state
law
was?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
is
--
this
is
the
due
process
issue,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
why
is
it
unfair?
why
is
there
an
entitlement
under
due
process
to
assert
what
appears
under
the
law
of
the
state's
intermediate
court
decisions
to
be
a
valid
defense,
but
is
later
determined
never
to
have
been
or
not
to
have
been
at
the
time
a
valid
defense?
what
is
the
unfairness
involved
there?
