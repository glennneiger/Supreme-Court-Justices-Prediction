justice
elena
kagan
you
--
you
suggested,
general,
that
the
--
the
fact
that
this
is
statutory
makes
your
position
easier.
justice
elena
kagan
and
i
wonder
if
that's
true.
i
mean,
you
could
see
an
--
an
argument
the
exact
other
way,
which
suggests
that
we
all
understand
that
common
law
changes
and
evolves
over
time,
but
that
it's
rare
for
a
court
to
reverse
a
decision
on
what
a
statute
means,
and
that
that's
not
foreseeable
in
the
same
way.
so
--
now,
especially
if
it
were
a
single
court
saying
the
statute
means
a
today,
and
then
tomorrow
it
comes
back
and
it
says,
no,
it
means
b,
whether
that
isn't
actually
--
whether
that
wouldn't
cut
against
your
position.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
general,
i
guess
i
wonder
whether
it's
relevant
what
the
statute
really
says
as
opposed
to
what
courts
said
it
says.
i
mean,
sometimes
judges
make
errors
and
our
law
is
dotted
with
places
where
courts
have
made
errors
and
said
that
things
mean
what
they
don't
mean
or
don't
mean
what
they
do
mean,
and,
you
know,
we
expect
people
to
follow
what
the
court
says
is
the
law
even
if
there's
really
a
better
reading
out
there.
and
also,
we
think
that
people
should
rely
on
what
the
court
says
is
the
law,
even
though
there's
really
a
better
reading
out
there.
and
so,
you
know,
what
does
it
matter
if
we
come
out
and
said
--
and
say,
you
know,
what
were
these
crazy
michigan
courts
doing?
if
that's
what
they
were
doing,
it
seems
as
though
people
had
a
right
to
rely
on
that.
justice
elena
kagan
but
was
there
anyone
prior
to
2001
who
couldn't
raise
a
defense
like
this,
who
was
precluded
from
doing
so
because
a
court
thought,
oh,
you
know,
the
--
the
statute
really
clears
the
field,
and
--
and
this
defense
is
not
available?
was
it
--
can
you
point
to
anything?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
they
can
point
to
just
a
lot
of
people
who
were
raising
this
defense.
justice
elena
kagan
this
is
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
have
something
like
in
the
middle?
[laughter]
justice
elena
kagan
and
if
you
were
a
prosecutor,
you
would
not
have
objected
to
that
defense,
would
you
have?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
have
any--
justice
elena
kagan
--have
any
reason
to
think
that
any
prosecutor
ever
objected
to
such
a
defense?
justice
elena
kagan
just
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
i
mean,
there
may
be
no
way
you
can
answer
this,
but
are
we
talking
about,
you
know,
do
five
people
a
year
--
did
five
people
a
year
raise
this
or
--
or
20
or
100?
i
mean,
what
kind
of
numbers?
justice
elena
kagan
right.
justice
elena
kagan
you
can't
really
tell
because
nobody
was
objecting
to
anything--
justice
elena
kagan
--right?
