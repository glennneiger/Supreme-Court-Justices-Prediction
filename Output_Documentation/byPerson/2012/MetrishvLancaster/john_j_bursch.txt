mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
sixth
circuit
habeas
appeal
involving
aedpa
deference.
harrington
v.
richter
holds
that
a
federal
court
may
only
overturn
a
state
court
conviction
that
is
such
an
erroneous
misapplication
of
this
court's
clearly
established
precedent
as
to
be
beyond
any
possibility
of
fair-minded
disagreement.
that
is,
an
extreme
malfunction.
here,
a
fair-minded
jurist
could
conclude
that
the
michigan
supreme
court's
carpenter
decision
was
neither
indefensible
nor
unexpected
when
it
simply
applied
plain
statutory
language
in
accord
with
well-established
michigan
interpretive
principles.
accordingly,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
application
of
carpenter
was
not
error,
and
the
sixth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
statutory
text.
in
1975,
the
michigan
legislature
passed
a
comprehensive
mental
capacity
affirmative
defense
statute.
in
it,
the
defenses
are
defined
for
mental
illness
and
mental
retardation,
but
it
says
nothing
about
diminished
capacity.
and
that
silence
is
crucial
here,
because
in
michigan,
for
over
200
years,
it
has
been
a
code
jurisdiction,
which
means
that
if
the
statutes
address
a
particular
area
of
criminal
law,
only
that
statute
applies,
and
the
michigan
courts
are
not
allowed
to
either
add
to
or
subtract
from
that
statutory
text.
so
only
the
michigan
legislature
had
the
power
to
add
a
diminished
capacity
defense.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
actually,
even
before
michigan
was
a
territory
--
i'm
--
before
it
was
a
state
in
1810,
it
passed
a
law
that
abolished
common
law
criminal
principles
when
there
was
a
statute
that
addressed
the
--
the
subject
matter.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
it
--
it
changed
one
time.
in
1973,
there
was
a
michigan
court
of
appeals
decision
that
recognized
as
a
matter
of
common
law
the
diminished
capacity
defense,
but
that
was
set
aside
by
the
1975
statute
which
established
all
the
comprehensive
diminished
capacity
defenses
available,
and
left
out
diminished
capacity.
so
in
1975,
1976,
you
know,
1978--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
did
beginning
in
1978
in
the
mangiapane
case
was
to
ask,
is
diminished
capacity
part
of
the
statutory
code,
and
it
never
held
expressly
that
it
was.
what
it
did
in
mangiapane
and
in
subsequent
cases,
it
assumed
that
the
defense
existed,
but
it
never
held
that.
and
that
dicta
could
not
override
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
and,
in
fact,
counsel
on
the
other
side
has
not
pointed
to
a
single
michigan
decision
where
a
conviction
or
an
exoneration
on
acquittal,
or
even
a
finding
of
ineffective
assistance
was
ever
based
on
the
diminished
capacity
defense.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
the
1973
case
was
a
common
law
vacuum,
justice
kennedy,
where
the
michigan
legislature
had
not
yet
spoken
about
mental
incapacity
defenses,
and
so
it
stood
alone,
as
the
court
was
able
to
do,
as
a
common
law
decision.
there
were
no
other
cases
that
relied
on
it
before
the
'75
statute
was
enacted.
and
after
that
point,
the
michigan
appellate
courts
did
not
look
to
the
'72
decision
as
the
source
of
the
doctrine.
they
assumed
that
if
it
existed,
it
must
be
somewhere
within
the
statute.
and
then
in
carpenter,
in
2001,
the
michigan
supreme
court,
when
finally
the
very
first
michigan
court
to
look
at
the
question
explicitly
says,
well,
it's
not
in
the
statute,
diminished
capacity
isn't
there.
we've
got
mental
retardation,
we've
got
mental
illness.
no
diminished
capacity.
as
the
michigan
judiciary,
we
lack
the
power
to
add
the
diminished
capacity
defense.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
think
you
would
apply
the
same
principles
to
that
hypothetical
as
you
did
in
rogers.
and
--
and
in
rogers,
you
had
a
nearly
100-year
common
law
history
of
the
year
and
a
day
rule
in
the
tennessee
supreme
court
that
the
defense
was
available
to
use
that
term
for
nearly
100
years,
and
yet
it
didn't
violate
due
process
in
rogers
for
the
tennessee
supreme
court
to
abolish
the
rule
because
it
was
neither
indefensible
nor
unexpected.
now,
this
case
is
much
easier
than
rogers
or
your
hypothetical
for
several
reasons.
first,
as
i
mentioned,
it's
a
habeas
case
and
so
we've
got
the
layer
of
aedpa
deference
that
wasn't
there.
second,
we're
not
talking
about
the
evolution
of
the
common
law
like
we
were
in
rogers.
we're
talking
about
a
statute
and
the
statute
meant
what
it
said
in
'75,
just
like
it
did
in
'01,
just
like
it
does
today.
and
the
last
thing
is
that
in
the
rogers
case
even
the
tennessee
supreme
court
acknowledged
there
was
a
change.
and
here
the
michigan
supreme
court
said
there
was
no
change
because
the
statute
said
what
it
said
in
1975
and
that
meant
no
diminished
capacity.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
alito,
i
would
think
about
it
in
--
in
two
pieces.
and
the
first
piece
is
can
you
second-guess
the
michigan
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
the
answer
there
everybody
has
to
agree
is
no.
the
state's
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
binds
this
court,
binds
all
federal
courts,
just
like
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
decision
in
--
in
bouie
did.
with
respect
to
the
michigan
supreme
court's
analysis
of
the
retroactive
effect,
i
agree
that
fiore
stands
for
that
very
proposition,
and
i
think
indiana
makes
that
case
very
forcefully
in
the
--
the
multi-state
amici
brief.
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
here,
however,
because
given
the
aedpa
standard
and
the
fact
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
decision
was
so
clearly
not
a
misapplication
of
rogers
and
bouie,
it
makes
this
a
relatively
easy
case.
but
i
think
you'd
be
fully
within
your
right
to
follow
the
fiore
holding.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
kagan,
i
think
this
is
the
easiest
case,
because
it's
not
just
statutory
interpretation;
it's
statutory
interpretation
of
a
statute
that
is
just
plain
on
its
face.
if
you
had
an
ambiguous
statute,
yes,
then
maybe
there
would
be
some
more
uncertainty.
but
where
you've
got
a
statute
that
enumerates
several
defenses,
does
not
include
diminished
capacity,
and
under
michigan
law
it's
not
enumerated,
it's
not
there,
and
the
courts
can't
add
it,
that
does
make
this
easier.
i
think
it
was
probably
a
--
a
bigger
challenge
in
rogers,
for
example,
to
acknowledge
that,
one,
tennessee
law
had
changed
right
out
from
underneath
the
defendant;
and
yet,
even
given
that
change,
this
court
was
comfortable
that
it
was
not
indefensible
or
unexpected.
i
think
when--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
it
--
it
didn't
recognize
it
as
a
defense
in
the
sense
that
it
analyzed
the
statute
and
said
yes,
the
defense
is
available.
it
in
many
instances
assumed
that
it
might
exist
and
if
it
did
then
this
is
the
result.
the
closest
it
comes
is
this
mangiapane
decision
in
1978,
and
the
court
says
very
specifically
there
that
the
definition
of
mental
illness
in
the
statute,
it's
similar
to
diminished
capacity,
but
the
court
says
at
page
247
of
the
north
west
second
report
the
court
was
not
prepared
to
say
they
are
identical.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
so--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--recognizing
it
as
a
possible
defense.
again,
in
every
single
one
of
those
cases,
all
of
which
would
be
contrary
to
the
statutory
language,
incidentally,
in
not
a
single
one
of
them
did
a
conviction
or
an
acquittal
or
a
finding
of
ineffective
assistance
ever
turn
on
that
point.
and
so
in
that
sense,
it's
also
again
very
much
like
rogers,
where
this
court
said
that
the
year
and
a
day
rule
had
never
been
used
for
an
acquittal
or
a
conviction
in
any
tennessee
case.
and
so
the
question
is,
again
through
the
aedpa
deference
lens,
which
is
very
high,
was
the
carpenter
decision
defensible
and
expected?
and
we
would
submit
that
any
time
that
a
state
supreme
court
applies
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
in
accord
with
established
principles
of
interpretation
in
that
state,
it
could
almost
never
be
indefensible
or
unexpected.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
two
responses
to
that,
justice
sotomayor.
first,
i
want
to
be
again
very
careful
about
what
mangiapane
actually
held.
it
did
look
at
the
statutory
language
and
at
page
247
said:
"we
are
not
prepared
to
say
they
are
identical.
"
meaning
the
definition
of
mental
illness
and
the
concept
of
diminished
capacity.
there
the
question
was
procedural
because
the
defendant
had
not
given
the
prosecutor
notice
of
any
defense
based
on
mental
capacity
in
the
trial
court,
and
so
the
court
said,
well,
you
know,
assuming
that
the
--
the
defense
exists,
we
are
not
prepared
to
decide
that
today--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--because
you
would
have
to
give
statutory
notice.
the
second--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--justice
scalia,
that
was
my
second
point.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
it
was
clear.
and
if
any
michigan
court
had
had
the
opportunity
to
actually
decide
it
on
the
merits
in
light
of
this
200-year
history
of
michigan
being
a
criminal
code
state,
it
was
clear.
and
so
this
is
the
point
when
a
state
court
decision
is
most
defensible
and
most
expected,
applying
the
plain
language
of
a
clear
statute
in
accord
with
state
principles.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
justice
kennedy,
i'm
not
aware
of--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i'm
not
aware
of
any
other
states
that
have
the
same
statute
and
have
addressed
the
question
one
way
or
the
other.
i
do
know
that
the
language
of
the
michigan
statute
is
fairly
unique.
if
you
look
in
the
criminal
law
treatises,
we're
kind
of
in
a
category
of
only
a
very
few
states
that,
you
know,
on
the
one
hand,
define
mental
illness
and
mental
retardation,
do
not
define
or
mention
diminished
capacity,
and
yet
still
have
this
guilty
but
insane
option,
which
is
something
that
michigan
common
law
did
not
have,
but
then
that
was
added
in
the
'75
statute.
so
it's
a
little
bit
unique.
i
think
it's
also
unique
to
michigan
that
we
have
this
200-year
criminal
code
history,
which
if
you're
interested
you
can
read
all
about
it
in
the
in
re
lamphere
case
that
we
cite
on
page
4
to
5
of
our
reply
brief.
but
it's
when
you
put
those
things
together
that
really
make
this
such
an
easy
case.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
the
expectation
certainly
is
that
people
would
rely
on
michigan
statutory
law.
and
i
concede
that
this
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
if
the
michigan
supreme
court
in,
say,
1990
had
come
out
in
a
published
opinion
and
and
said
the
exact
opposite
of
what
it
said
in
2001.
obviously,
that's
not
what
happened
here.
but
--
but
ultimately,
you
know,
the
question
that
would
have
been
on
mr.
lancaster's
mind
back
in
1993
when
he
shot
and
killed
toni
king
was,
does
michigan
law
prohibit
me,
will
it
punish
me
if
i
--
i
kill
someone?
and
--
and
clearly,
he
had
to
know
that.
and
if
he
had
looked
at
the
1975
statute,
he
would
have
seen
that
diminished
capacity
was
not
mentioned
there.
so
to
the
extent
that
he
--
he
wanted
to
rely
on
that
defense,
he
wouldn't
have
found
it
in
michigan's
codified
law.
now,
i
know
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is,
well,
we
have
these
other
cases
which,
you
know,
mention
the
doctrine,
kind
of
assume
without
deciding
that
--
that
it's
out
there.
and
he
wants
to
assume
that
he
has
all
the
knowledge
of
that,
but
not
the
knowledge
of
the
background
principle
that
michigan
won't
add
affirmative
defenses
to
a
statute
through
a
judicial
action.
and
if
you're
going
to
impute
any
knowledge
to
him,
and
--
and
we
submit
that
you
probably
shouldn't,
then
you've
got
to
impute
all
the
knowledge
of
michigan
law,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
interpretive
principles
that
should
guide
what
that
statute
means.
he
knew
that
killing
someone
was
wrong.
unquestionably,
he
was
on
fair
notice
of
that.
and
--
and
just
like
in
rogers,
this
diminished
capacity
defense
after
1975
was
never
relied
on
by
any
michigan
court
to
either
hold
someone
guilty
or
to
acquit
them
or
to
find
that
there
was
ineffective
assistance.
it
just
was
not
the
kind
of
well-established
principle
that
could
possibly
make
the
carpenter
decision
either
indefensible
or
unexpected.
and
then
when
you
layer
that
on
top
with
aedpa
deference,
you
know,
really,
this
is
about
as
simple
as
it
gets.
there
is
no
decision
of
--
of
this
court,
not
rogers,
not
bouie,
not
fiore,
not
bunkley,
any
court
decision
that
is
contrary
to
or
misapplied
in
this
michigan
court
of
appeals
opinion.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
i
think
we
actually
have
a
lot
of
areas
of
agreement
after
45
minutes
of
oral
argument.
number
one,
justice
breyer,
is
that
there
really
is
only
one
case
in
michigan
that
reaches
the
holding
that
mr.
carpenter
would
like
that
you
can
assert
this
defense,
and
that
was
the
lynch
case
in
1973,
which
preceded
the
1975
statute.
so
under
well-established
michigan
law,
again,
you
know,
in
re
lamphier,
reese,
which
was
their
2012
decision
reapplying
in
re
lamphier,
that
code
occupies
the
field,
and
at
that
point,
the
common
law
decision
no
longer
existed.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i
did
not
hear
him
say
that.
and
if
you
go
back
and
you
read
reese
and
in
re
lamphier,
i
don't
know
how
anyone
could
possibly
disagree
with
that.
there
are
certainly
areas--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--sure.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
okay.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
then
i
disagree
with
that.
if
you
look
at
in
re
lamphier
and
reese,
it's
well-settled
in
michigan
that
when
the
michigan
legislature
speaks
to
a
particular
subject
matter
in
criminal
law
that
the
code
controls
and
the
common
law
cannot
supplement
it.
the
words
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
reese
itself
were:
"the
courts
have
no
power
to
add
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
legislature
did
not
create.
"
and
--
and
i
really
don't
think
there
can
be
a
dispute
about
that.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
i'm
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
justice
ginsburg,
and
--
and
the
reason
for
that
--
that
quirk
is
because
his
habeas
process
by
coincidence
happened
to
take
such
a
long
time.
it's
pretty
rare
that
we're
up
here
on
a
case
where
the
murder
actually
took
place
20
years
ago
and
the
trial
is
shortly
after
that.
but
--
but
quirks
in
how
long
litigation
happens
don't
determine
whether
the
people
get
the
benefit
of
changes
in
law
or
not.
what
matters
is
the
standard
that
this
court
applied
in
rogers
and
bouie,
was
the
change
--
if
there
was
a
change
--
indefensible
and
not
expected.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
we
can't
point
to
anything,
just
like
they
can't
point
to
anything.
you've
got
a
--
you
know,
in
1975--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--right.
and
they
can
point
to
cases
that
assume
without
deciding
that
the
defense
might
exist.
and
then
it
wasn't
until
2001,
when
the
michigan
supreme
court
became
the
first
michigan
court
to
look
at
it
--
and
i
forget
now
who
mentioned
this;
i
think
it
was
justice
kennedy
--
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
what
this
court
often
does:
it
waited
for
the
right
case
to
present
itself.
and
when
it
did,
it
applied
the
plain
statutory
language
in
accordance
with
michigan
interpretive
law.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
you
know,
it
could
be
because
the
michigan
supreme
court
thought,
you
know,
there's
enough
confusion,
because
of
the
mentions
in
the
lower
court,
that
it's
time
that
--
that
we
address
this.
i
don't
know
why
the
michigan
supreme
court
took
it
up
in
carpenter.
what
i
do
know
is
that
fair-minded
jurists,
which
is
the
habeas
standard,
could
agree
that
carpenter
was
neither
indefensible
nor
unexpected.
and,
you
know,
it's
not
a
head-counting
business,
but
i
would
note
that
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
here
was
unanimous.
previously,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
in
talton,
decided
the
year
after
carpenter,
reached
the
exact
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
due
process
question.
so
we've
got
six
michigan
appellate
judges
looking
at
this.
you
know,
going
back
to
--
to
what
the
michigan
law
said,
i
--
i
also
heard
my
friend
mention
the
griffin
case.
this
is
the
three-paragraph
order
where
they
--
they
remand
for
ineffective
assistance.
well,
griffin
is
one
of
the
cases
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
discusses
in
carpenter,
and
in
the
very
next
sentence,
the
supreme
court
says:
"however,
we
have
never
specifically
authorized
the
defense's
use
in
michigan
courts.
"
you
know,
it
just
wasn't
there.
what
you
have
are
these
mentions,
and
then,
as
justice
breyer
mentioned,
he's
got
jury
instructions
which
are
promulgated
by
the
state
bar,
not
the
state
supreme
court,
or
by
any
court
for
that
matter.
and
what
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
is
it
objectively
unreasonable,
is
it
beyond
any
possibility
of
fair-minded
disagreement
that
a
michigan
court
of
appeals
panel
could
conclude
that
carpenter
was
both
indefensible
and
unexpected.
and--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--well,
all
we
have
are
the
mentions
in
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
about
37,
i
believe.
it
was
four
michigan
supreme
court
opinions
and
33
court
of
appeals.
so
it
was
37.
now,
of
those
the
michigan
supreme
court
itself
said
their
four
decisions
didn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
of
the
other
33,
32
of
them
weren't
even
binding
in
other
michigan
court
of
appeals
panels.
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
wasn't
bound
to
follow
any
panel
decision
prior
to
november
1st,
1990.
so
those
weren't
even
binding
on
the
court
of
appeals
itself.
if
you
are
thinking
about
what's
firmly
established,
you
know,
there
were
no
roots
at
all
to
these
mentions.
it
would
be
like
walking
past
your
neighbor's
yard,
and
if
there
is
an
oak
tree
there,
you
expect
it
to
be
there
the
next
day.
you
know,
but
if
there
is
a
small
weed,
you
expect
it
to
be
pulled
up
and
rooted
out.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here
when
the
michigan
supreme
court
finally
addressed
the
question.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
i
mentioned
reese
because
it's
the
most
recent
application.
it
cites
in
re
lamphier,
which
is
an
1886
decision,
which
itself
references
the
1810
territorial
act
which
abolished
common
law
criminal
principles
--
if
you
have
the
statute--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--there
are
many
cases
in
the
middle.
there
is
at
least
a
1990
case,
although
i
can't
recall
the
name.
if
you
just
key
cite
or
shepherdize
in
re
lamphier,
you
--
you
will
find
scores
of
cases
that
rely
on
this
proposition.
it's
--
it's
not
in
dispute.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
right.
exactly.
you've
got
lynch,
which
was
the
common
law.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
oh,
no,
no,
no.
to
be
perfectly
clear,
what
in
re
lamphier
and
reese
and
everything
else
say
is
that
when
the
legislature
has
spoken
to
a
particular
area,
then
the
courts
cannot
supplement.
they
had
never
spoken
about
mental
capacity
defenses
prior
to
1975,
and
so
the
slate
was
free
for
the
courts
to
do
what
they
wanted.
so
there's
nothing
wrong
with
lynch
in
'73.
the
problem
is
continuing
to
assume
that
there
was
a
defense
that
wasn't
in
the
'75
statute.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
undoubtedly.
but
i
don't
think
it
means
that
fair-minded
jurists
could
not
possibly
conclude
that
carpenter
was
both
indefensible
and
not
expected.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
well,
i
don't
know.
if
i
was
a
prosecutor,
i
would
have
looked
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--and
i
probably
would
have--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--i
don't
know
one
way
or
the
other.
we
--
we
just
don't
have
the
data
for
that.
so
ultimately,
what
we
are
talking
about
here--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
no,
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
a
single
case
in
those
37
where
someone
tried
to
raise
the
defense
and
the
court
said
no.
nor
was
there
a
case
where
the
prosecutor
said
you
can't
raise
the
defense
and
the
court
said
yes.
it
was
just
a
number
of
cases.
and,
you
know,
mangiapane
is
really
the
paradigm
example.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
but
the
question
was,
did
they
give
notice?
if
the
defense
exists,
is
it
part
of
the
statute?
and
--
and
all
the
michigan
courts
agree
that
that
has
to
be
the
case.
but
it's
not
till
carpenter
where
the
court
finally
says,
is
it
part
of
the
statute
and
says
no.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
you
know,
all
we've
got
are
the
appellate
decisions
referencing
it.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
so
if
we've
got
37
cases--
mr.
john
j.
bursch
--correct.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
so
you've
got
37
cases
over
a
course
of
18
years,
'75
to
--
to
'93.
now,
that
--
that
tells
us
maybe
two
cases
a
year
in
a
system
that
processes
thousands
of
criminal
cases.
you
know,
there
was
nothing
here
that
would
make
the
supreme
court's
application
of
the
plain
language
so
indefensible,
so
unexpected
that
no
reasonable
jurist
could
possibly
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
as
now
two
unanimous
michigan
court
of
appeals
panels
have.
i
wanted
to
touch
briefly
on
the
unfairness
point.
and
justice
ginsburg,
i
--
i
believe
brought
up
bouie.
and
bouie
is
really
the
perfect
analogy,
because,
again,
under
the
aedpa
standard,
it's
lancaster's
burden
to
show
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
here
was
contrary
to
our
misapplication.
and,
to
the
contrary,
it
was
the
exact
application
of
bouie.
in
bouie,
you
had
a
clear
statute
that
was
very
narrow,
and
the
state
court
expanded
it
in
a
very
unexpected
way.
and
this
court
found
that
was
indefensible
and
unexpected.
the
exact
opposite
happened
here.
you
had
the
michigan
supreme
court
applying
very
narrow
statutory
language
exactly
the
way
it
was
written
in
accord
with
200
years
of
interpretive
principles.
so
--
so
really,
the
problem
here
is
not
any
unfairness,
the
problem
is
the
sixth
circuit
yet
again
not
applying
habeas
deference
under
the
statute
or
this
court's
precedent
and
disregarding
another
michigan
state
court
decision
where
reasonable
jurists
could
have
reached
different
conclusions
on
this.
it's
not
our
burden
to
--
to
demonstrate
what
the
law
was
or
wasn't.
all
we
have
to
show
is
that
a
reasonable
jurist
could
have
reached
the
conclusion
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
did
here,
and
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
any
question
that's
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
bursch
yes,
justice
scalia.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
