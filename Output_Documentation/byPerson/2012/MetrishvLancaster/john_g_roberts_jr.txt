chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-547,
metrish
v.
lancaster.
mr.
bursch?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
mogill.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
said
your
view
of
the
law
was,
you
know,
so
well-established--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--as
to
be
beyond
question.
that
is
the
standard
under
aedpa,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
to
be
--
you
have
to
be
--
you
have
to
be
that
right
to
prevail,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
--
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
lynch
--
the
lynch
case
was
2
years
before
the
michigan
legislature
adopted--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with
here,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that's
where
you
are
putting,
if
not
all
of
your
eggs,
most
of
your
eggs,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
--
that's
the
whole
case.
the
whole
--
the
whole
point
is
that
the
law
made
that
moot
because
the
law
under
michigan
did
not
specify
diminished
capacity
and
it's
a
code
state,
so
you
only
get
what
they
specified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you'll
at
least
--
well,
maybe
not.
i
mean,
would
--
would
you
acknowledge
that
the
force
of
lynch
was
arguably
diminished
by
the
fact
that
michigan
passed
a
statute
that
did
not
mention
the
diminished
capacity
defense
2
years
after
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
lynch.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
two
--
two
dissents
is
what
you're
relying
on?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
bursch,
you
have
13
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
hate
just
to
interrupt
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
did
challenge
my
premise
when
i
presented
that
to
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
do
think
he
disagrees
with
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
you
were
representing
a
defendant
in
this
position,
you
certainly
would
have
raised
the
diminished
capacity
defense
prior
to
carpenter,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-547,
metrich
versus
lancaster.
