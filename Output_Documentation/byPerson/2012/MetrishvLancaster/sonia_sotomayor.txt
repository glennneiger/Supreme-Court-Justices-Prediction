this
--
that
seems
a
little
strange
for
the
following
reason,
just
as
i
think
this
case
presents
an
example.
you're
claiming
it's
clear
because
the
supreme
court
said
it
was
clear,
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
mangiapane,
whether
or
not
it
assumed
it
or
not,
did
an
analysis
that
clearly
says
that
it
believes
that
the
definition
of
legal
insanity
includes
diminished
capacity.
its
holding
didn't
need
that
analysis,
because
it
could
have
assumed
it
and
then
just
said:
but
no
notice
was
given,
so
the
defense
fails
here.
it
took
the
time
to
analyze
just
this
question
and
came
to
a
contrary
conclusion.
its
contrary
conclusion
was
that
“
legal
insanity
”
was
a
broad
enough
term
under
michigan
law
to
encompass
this
defense.
the
court
of
--
the
state
supreme
court
has
now
said
no,
it's
not.
but
i
don't
know
that
that
makes
the
statute
any
less
ambiguous
merely
because
a
court
announces
that
it
thin
ks
it's
not.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
--
that's
your
whole
point,
isn't
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
can't
prove
a
negative,
because
if
everybody
accepts
after
mangiapane
that
the
defense
exists
then
trial
courts
are
not
going
to
be
excluding
it
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
excludes
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
whole
point
you
are
making.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
--
is
there
any
evidence
of
a
trial
court
holding
an
exclusion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
even
suggesting
one?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
then
you
were
arguing
that
lynch
was
wrong
to
begin
with,
because
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
it
created
a
common
law
defense
that
the
courts
say
you
can't
under
michigan
law.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
but
you're
saying
to
me
it
was
wrongly
decided
under
this
general
michigan--
