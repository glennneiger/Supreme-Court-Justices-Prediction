justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
holdings
are
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
the
answer
is
zero,
right?
i
mean,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
looked
at
your
brief
and
then
i
looked
at
their
brief
and
they
say
the
answer
is
zero.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
--
the
holding
is
that
--
the
pure
holding
would
be
if
the
trial
court
judge
says
no,
you
cannot
raise
it.
okay?
the
defendant
is
convicted
and
appeals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
he
says
to
the
appellate
court:
they
wouldn't
let
me
raise
it.
and
the
appellate
court
says:
you
have
a
right
to
raise
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
lynch.
and
lynch
is
what
year?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
1973.
okay.
so
we
have
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
was
there
any
other
case
in
1973
--
this
is
10
years
before.
was
there
any
other
case
in
which
the
same
pattern
of
facts
and
they
said
the
same
thing
as
lynch?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
we
--
we
have
lynch
on
one
side.
is
there
any
case
--
this
is
an
intermediate
appeals
court
--
is
there
any
case
in
which
the
defendant
says,
i
would
like
to
raise
it,
the
judge
says
no,
convicted,
appeal,
and
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
says:
defendant,
you
are
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
and
so
all
this
period
from
1973
until
1995
or
whatever--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--carpenter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
2001.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
exactly
one
case
on
point
which
does
favor
you,
and
there
are
zero
cases
that
favor
them;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
mangiapane
was
a
--
a
lot
of
words,
but
the
holding
was
not
notice;
isn't
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we've
got
one.
that's
--
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
state
of
the
art.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
state
of
the
art
is
one
for
you,
zero
for
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
were
no
others,
and
now
i've
reduced
your
one
to
nothing
to
like.01
to
nothing,
because
it
favors
you,
lynch,
yes,
as
the
chief
justice
just
pointed
out,
and
now
you've
already
said
there
were
no
other
cases.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
because
--
everybody
agrees
with
you,
i
think
--
i
agree
with
you
on
this
anyway.
i
agree
the
bar
puts
it
in
the
instructions,
and
if
the
bar
puts
it
in
the
instructions,
people
tend
to
follow
it.
that's
true.
so
it's
not
surprising
that
a
lot
of
people
tend
to
follow
it.
but
as
far
as
court
decisions
are
concerned,
we
have
no
--
what
i'm
trying
to
think
of
is
a
pre-statute.
i
give
you
a
little
credit
on
that.
that's
lynch.
pre-statute,
and
we
have
what
i
might
sort
of
exaggeratedly
refer
to
as
the
great
mentioner.
we've
noticed
the
great
mentioner
is
often
wrong,
and
--
and
here,
even
though
there
are
judicial
mentioners,
they
get
something.
i
don't
know
how
much
in
the
scale
to
--
to
give
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
think
of
a
federal
case
where
--
i
see
what
we
have.
i'm
now
adding
up
the
something
for
lynch,
the
something
for
the
bar,
which
is
a
--
which
is
a
something,
and
--
and
then
the
fact
that
some
courts
have
quite,
not
surprisingly,
tended
to
follow
it
and
there
were
others
that
mentioned
it
favorably,
but
not
the
michigan
supreme
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
--
so
we've
got
that.
now,
actually,
that
kentucky
case,
was
it?
tennessee?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
rogers.
that
went
against
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
can
you
think
of
any
federal
precedent
on
this
issue
that's
come
even
close
to
that
being
sufficient?
what's
your
best?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
alternative
is
you
are
going
to
allow
the
bar
associations,
helpful
as
they
are,
by
writing
instructions
to
determine
issues
that
courts
themselves
have
never
determined,
or
at
least
not
authoritative
supreme
courts.
and
that's
a
worrying
matter
where
you
are
trying
to
create
coherent
systems
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
idea,
a
rough
estimate,
how
many
cases
there
were
between,
say,
'75
and
'93
where
this
defense
was
raised?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
do
know
about
how
many?
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what's
in
the
37
cases
then?
i
--
they
got
up
there.
i
assume
the
defendant
must
have
brought
them.
they
must
have
brought
them.
he
must
have
wanted
to
--
to
raise
the
defense
and
somebody
said
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
