there
was
some
law
in
effect
in
michigan
on
this
subject
from
the
year
1973
till
the
year
2001.
there
was
no
statute
and
there
was
no
ancient
common
law.
but
what
--
what
was
it?
if
i
asked
you
the
question,
what
was
the
law
in
michigan
on
diminished
capacity
from
1973
to
2001,
what
would
you
respond?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
--
how
was
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
construing
the
defense?
did
it
say
--
it
didn't
say
anything
about
the
1975
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
counsel,
what
about
the
michigan
court
of
appeals?
there's
only
one
court
of
appeals,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
that
court
several
times
recognized
diminished
capacity
as
a
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
colleague
said
that
there
were
130
appellate
decisions
--
i
take
it
that's
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
--
recognizing
diminished
capacity
as
a
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
the
question
that
was
asked
was,
as
a
bottom
line
at
the
end
of
the
day--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
anybody
get
sentenced
less?
did
it
affect
the
outcome?
you
gave
a
case
where
a
defendant
was
allowed
to
raise
diminished
capacity,
but
was
--
are
there
cases
where
the
defense
was
successful
on
the
merits?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
--
the
case
is
--
is
very
different
from
bouie
which
you
--
which
you
rely
on.
in
--
in
bouie,
it
was
the
question
of
a
rule
that
is
governing
conduct.
people
come
on
to
premises;
they
have
no
reason
to
think
that
they
are
committing
an
offense
if
they
don't
leave
when
somebody
asks
them
to
if
they
came
onto
the
premise
lawfully.
so
what
the
court
said
in
bouie
was
that
this
is
a
regulation
of
primary
conduct,
and
at
the
time
these
people
acted,
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
what
they
did
was
unlawful.
that's
quite
a
different--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
--
it
isn't
subjective
reliance,
it's
--
it's
what
was
the
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
said
that
the
state
supreme
court
interpretation
of
the
statute
was
quite
a
surprise.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
--
is
this
a
one
of
a
kind,
in
that,
whatever
the
law
was,
it's
clear
from
2001
on?
are
--
are
there
any
other
people
who
were
similarly
situated,
who
committed
a
crime
before
2001
but
were
tried
after?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
--
why
was
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--why
was
it
the
right
case?
the
parties
didn't
even
raise
it,
did
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
respondent
burt
lancaster
is
a
former
police
officer
with
a
long
history
of
severe
mental-health
problems.
in
april
1993,
he
shot
and
killed
his
girlfriend
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
shopping-plaza.
lancaster
was
convicted
in
michigan
state
court
of
first-degree
murder
and
a
related
firearm
offense.
at
the
time
of
the
shooting,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals,
which
is
michigan's
intermediate
appellate
court,
had
repeatedly
approved
the
defense
of
diminished-capacity.
the
defendant
invoking
that
defense
would
present
the
evidence
of
his
mental
illness,
not
to
establish
that
he
was
legally
insane,
but
instead
to
suggest
that
he
lacked
the
specific
intent,
the
mens
rea,
required
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
of
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged.
by
the
time
of
lancaster's
2005
trial,
however,
in
a
case
decided
in
2001,
people
v.
carpenter,
the
michigan
supreme
court
had
rejected
the
diminished-capacity
defense.
michigan's
legislature,
the
michigan
supreme
court
held,
had
foreclosed
use
of
the
defense
by
failing
to
incorporate
it
into
the
state's
comprehensive
statutory
scheme,
codified
in
1975,
governing
mental
illness
defenses.
based
on
carpenter's
holding,
the
judge
presiding
at
lancaster's
trial
barred
him
from
asserting
a
diminished-capacity
defense.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
rejecting
lancaster's
argument
that
the
trial
court's
retroactive
application
of
carpenter
violated
due
process.
after
the
michigan
supreme
court
declined
review,
lancaster
reasserted
his
due
process
claim
in
a
federal
habeas
petition.
the
district
court
denied
the
petition,
but
a
divided
the
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed.
the
michigan
high
court's
decision
in
carpenter
was
unforeseeable,
the
sixth
circuit
majority
concluded,
for
three
reasons:
first,
as
previously
mentioned
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
had
consistently
approved
the
diminished-capacity
defense.
second,
before
carpenter,
the
michigan
supreme
court
had
several
times
mentioned
the
defense
without
casting
a
shadow
of
doubt
on
it.
finally,
the
michigan
state
bar
had
included
the
defense
in
its
pattern
jury
instructions.
these
considerations
persuaded
the
sixth
circuit
majority
that
by
rejecting
lancaster's
due
process
claim,
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
had
unreasonably
applied
clearly
established
federal
law.
the
sixth
circuit,
therefore,
ruled
that
lancaster
was
entitled
to
a
new
trial
at
which
he
could
present
his
diminished-capacity
defense.
we
granted
review
and
now
reverse.
lancaster's
habeas
claim
is
subject
to
the
demanding
standards
set
by
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act
of
1996.
under
that
standard,
lancaster
may
gain
relief
only
if
the
state
court
decision
he
assails
unreasonably
applied
clearly
established
federal
law
as
determined
by
this
court.
lancaster
has
not
satisfied
that
exacting
standard.
when
the
judiciary
alters
a
common
law
doctrine
of
criminal
law,
we
have
held,
the
due
process
clause
prohibits
retroactive
application
of
the
alteration
only
if
the
rule
change
is
unexpected
and
indefensible
by
reference
to
the
law
expressed
prior
to
the
conduct
at
issue.
in
carpenter,
the
michigan
supreme
court,
for
the
first
time,
squarely
addressed
the
validity
of
the
diminished-capacity
defense.
rejecting
several
lower
court
decisions
that
had
approved
the
defense
michigan's
high
court
rested
its
judgment
on
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
controlling
statutory
language.
this
court
has
never
found
a
due
process
violation
in
circumstances
even
remotely
resembling
lancaster's
case.
fair-minded
jurist,
no
doubt,
could
conclude
that
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
--
the
decisions
of
that
court
reached
in
carpenter
was
not
unexpected
nor
was
it
indefensible.
lancaster,
therefore,
is
not
entitled
to
federal
habeas
relief.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous.
