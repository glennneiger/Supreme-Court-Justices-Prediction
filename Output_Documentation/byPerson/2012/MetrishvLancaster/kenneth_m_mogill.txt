mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
mr.
chief
justice
--
excuse
me
--
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
time
of
his
offense
in
this
matter,
respondent
had
a
well-established
uncontested
right
to
present
evidence
of
diminished
capacity
in
order
to
negate
the
elements
of
premeditation
and
deliberation
in
the
first-degree
murder
charge
against
him,
and
he
did
assert
that
defense
at
his
first
trial.
that
trial
was
rendered
unfair
by
the
prosecutor's
batson
error.
respondent
was
not
allowed
to
present
the
same
defense
at
his
retrial,
however,
because
8
years
after
his
offense,
the
michigan
supreme
court
unexpectedly
changed
the
rules
in
midstream,
holding
in
carpenter
that
a
statute
that
had
been
enacted
26
years
before
and
that
did
not
use
the
words
“
diminished
capacity
”,
did
not
express
an
intent
to
abolish
any
defense
of
diminished
capacity,
but
the
supreme
court
held
that
it
had
been
abolished.
that
was
fundamentally
unfair
to
respondent,
all
the
more
so,
because
if
the
michigan
courts
had
ruled
correctly
on
the
batson
issue,
retrial
would
have
occurred
before
2001,
and
there's
no
question
but
that
respondent
would
have
been
able
to
raise
the
diminished
capacity
as--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
with
all
due
respect--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--with
all
due
respect
to
opposing
counsel,
i
--
the
view
--
our
view
of
the
law
is
--
is
entirely
different.
michigan
recognizes
the
common
law
in
its
constitution.
michigan
law
has
--
was
firmly
established
that
the
diminished
capacity
defense
existed.
by
1973--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--i
disagree.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
first
of
all
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
--
let
somebody
off?
well,
first
of
all,
we're
not
talking
about--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--mitigates.
justice
scalia,
in
lynch
itself
in
1973,
ms.
lynch
was
charged
with
first-degree
murder
for
the
starvation
--
in
relation
to
the
starvation
death
of
her
infant.
the
trial
judge
declined
to
permit
--
declined
to
permit
her
to
offer
psychiatric
testimony
to
mitigate
to
second
degree.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
indicating
that
evidence,
mental
health
evidence
of
the
kind
she
wanted
to
offer,
was
admissible
to
establish
diminished
capacity,
that
is,
to
negate
the
element
of
premeditation
and
deliberation.
once
that
case
was
decided,
there
is
one
direction
only
in
michigan
law
from
1973
until
carpenter
by
surprise
in
2001.
yes,
the
statute
was
passed
in
1975,
and
just
3
years
later
in
1978,
mangiapane
decided
that
diminished
capacity
comes
within
the
definition
of
legal
insanity.
the
phrasing
in
the
--
in
the
court's
opinion
is
very
significant
and
it's
much
more
than
opposing
counsel
suggests.
the
court
stated
explicitly:
"we
find
that
the
--
the
defense
known
as
diminished
capacity
is
codified
within
the
definition
of
legal
insanity.
"
once
that
happened,
then
that
required
an
accused
who
wanted
to
raise
a
diminished
capacity
partial
defense
to
comply
with
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
new
statute.
from
that
point
forward,
it
was
clear
that
diminished
capacity
--
and
--
and
these
are
published
court
of
appeals
decisions,
so
they
are
binding
precedent
statewide
in
michigan
unless
or
until
reversed
or
modified
by
the
state
supreme
court,
the
legislature,
or
a
constitutional
amendment.
once
that
happened,
there
is
not
a
case,
including
in
carpenter
itself,
where
the
prosecution
objected
to
the
admissibility
of
diminished
capacity
evidence.
it
was
so
well-established,
it
was
beyond
question.
it
was
so
well--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that's
a
very
important
question.
the
--
the
closest
i
can
come,
the
first
part
of
my
answer
is
in
the
griffin
case
in
1989,
in
an
order
which
was
a
dispositive
order
and
therefore
was
precedent,
the
michigan
supreme
court
disposed
of
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
by
vacating
and
remanding
a
case
for
an
ineffective
assistance
hearing
because
of
defense
counsel's
failure,
inter
alia,
to
consider
a
diminished
capacity
defense.
that
order
could
not
have
occurred
unless
the
supreme
court
had
determined
that
diminished
capacity
was
a
valid
defense.
the
second
part--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--i
--
i
respectfully
submit
that
under
strickland
analysis,
no.
if
it
--
if
it's
not
an
established
defense,
if
it's
not
something
that
would
arguably
come
within
the
strickland
framework,
there
would
not
have
been
a
remand.
that
would
have
been
a
--
a
question
of
a
lawyer
trying
to
be
creative,
but
it
wouldn't
implicate
strickland
principles.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
the
basis
for
a
remand
in
a
case
like
this,
and
this
is
not
an
unusual
kind
of
a
situation
in
practice,
is
where
the
law
is
clear,
then
the
remand
is
to
determine
the
factual
basis
for
the
defendant's
claim,
were
the
facts
such
that
a
reasonably
competent
attorney
should
have
been
expected
to
investigate
and
--
and
raise
it.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
well
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
what
i
have
to
establish
is
that
the
decision
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
here
was
objectively
unreasonable.
and
whether
it's
beyond
question,
i
think
we
certainly
have
objectively
unreasonable
ruling
for
the
reasons
that
it
was
without
--
not
only
was
it
well-established
--
and
i
want
to
weave
into
this
the
second
part
of
what
i'd
like
to
answer
of
justice
ginsburg's
question.
i
think
it's
very
important
in
understanding
the
question
of
reversals
or
not
what
the
lay
of
the
land
was,
because
where
you
have
a
framework
that
allows
a
defense
to
be
raised
and
prosecutors
aren't
objecting,
the
--
the
application's
going
to
be
a
factual
matter
for
a
jury
to
decide.
so
it's
not
going
to
be
something
that's
going
to
percolate
up
into
appellate
legal
issues.
it's
going
to
be
successful
sometimes,
it's
not
going
to
be
successful
sometimes,
and
there
are
no
statistics
on
that.
but
it
doesn't
--
it
won't
present
a
legal
issue,
and
that's
in
no
small
part
why
the
question
of,
well,
what
about
a
reversal--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
and
that's
why
in
my--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--no,
it
was
both.
the
--
the
insanity
defense
is
separate
from
diminished
capacity,
which
is
a
partial
defense;
in
fact,
in
respondent's
first
trial,
prior
counsel
had
raised
both.
at
retrial
i
only
wished
to
raise
the
diminished
capacity
defense.
the
law
recognizes
the
difference
between
the
two
in
michigan.
had
diminished
capacity
not
been
a
recognized
defense,
the
court's
order,
i
respectfully
submit,
would
have
been
worded
just
with
respect
to
insanity.
there
would
have
been
no
legal
basis
for
arguing
--
or,
excuse
me,
for
including
the
--
the
reference
to
diminished
capacity.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have.
we
have,
from--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--the
problem,
i
--
i
respectfully
submit,
is
that
nobody
in
michigan
until
carpenter
--
and
--
and
i
--
it
--
that
sounds
like
an
extreme
statement,
but
again
the
record
is
clear.
prosecutor's
weren't
objecting.
there
is
a
state
bar
committee
on
criminal
jury
instructions
whose
responsibility
it
is
to
come
up
with
standard
jury
instructions
on
areas
of
law
that
are
agreed
upon
and
--
and
routinely
enough
raised
in
court
to
warrant
a
standard
instruction.
that
committee
is
comprised
of
judges,
prosecutors,
and
defense
attorneys.
in
1989,
that
committee
promulgated
a
diminished
capacity
instruction.
that's
how
well
established
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
--
what
would
happen--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--convicted,
convicted
of
second
instead
of
first;
could
he
be
tried
on
first?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no.
but
that's
the
question.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
on
first,
no.
but--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--no.
what
i
--
but
i
--
justice
scalia,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
--
is
encompassed
by
the
statutory
scheme
which
requires
advanced
notice.
the
--
a
defendant
can't
offer
diminished
capacity
evidence
in
the
middle
of
trial.
a
defendant
has
to
give
30
days
or
whatever
other
time
set
by
the
judge
notice,
or
it
had
to
at
the
time.
if
the
prosecutor,
in
any
case,
believed
that
such
evidence
wasn't
admissible,
the
prosecutor
had
plenty
of
time
prior
to
trial
to
seek
an
in
limine
ruling
from
the
trial
court,
to
seek
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
michigan
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
and
--
and
i
will
tell
you
the
prosecutors
in
michigan
are
aggressive
in
--
in
seeking
interlocutory
appeals.
we
have
--
again,
it
is
so
well
established,
there
is
not
a
contrary
decision,
there
is
not
a
question
raised
in
any
opinion
or
any
decision.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there
are
many
mentions
with
the
--
the
holdings--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--no.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
lynch
is
a
holding.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
and
that's
exactly
lynch,
justice
breyer.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
1973.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
and
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
--
i'm
not
aware--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
is
there
is
no
such
case.
and
the
reason--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--'93
was
the
offense.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
2001
was
carpenter--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--the
offense
was
'93.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
you
talk
holding
only
and
if
you
discount
mangiapane.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
holding
was
he
didn't
--
but
there
was
no
reason
for
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--to
reach
that
question
unless
diminished
capacity
exists.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
i
can
supplement
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
one
of
the
things
--
one
of
the
points
this
court
looked
to
in
rogers
was
how
many
times
the
year-and-a-day
rule
had
been
“
mentioned
”,
and
that
--
this
is
--
that's
this
court's
word
--
in
tennessee
decisions.
and
so
one
of
the
things
we
did,
and
that's
the
addendum
in
our
red
brief,
is
look
at
how
many
times
there
are
mentions
--
all
of
which
are
favorable,
not
one
of
which
raises
even
a
question,
of
diminished
capacity
in
michigan.
and
that--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--we
have
4
mentions
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
33
in
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
between
1975
and
1993,
and
we
have
over
100
--
about
100--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--well,
griffin
is
one
of
them.
and
then
you
have--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
don't
know
of
a
particular
case.
but
to
answer
your
question,
justice
scalia,
the
law
in
michigan
is
clear,
as
stated
by
the
michigan
supreme
court,
that
a
published
court
of
appeals
decision
is
precedentially
binding
statewide
unless
and
until
reversed
by
the
supreme
court.
so
the
fact
that--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--no.
but
in
terms
of
it--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--no,
i
have
to
show
that
it
is
the
law
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--i
have
to
show
that
it
is
the
law
of
the
state.
and
it
was
the
law
of
the
state
from
1973
forward.
and
i
would
like
to
supplement
that,
if
i
might.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
when
--
when
lynch
was
decided,
it
wasn't
acting
on
something
new.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
indicates
that
what
we're
doing
is
nothing
novel
because
the
diminished
--
the
right
to
present
diminished
capacity
evidence
to
rebut
an
--
the
elements
of
premeditation
and
deliberation,
grows
out
of
a
100-year
history
in
michigan.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
i'm
--
that
--
that
is
--
that's
an
egg,
and
i
think
i've
got
a
pretty
full
basket.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
disagree
with
that
statement
by
brother
counsel.
the
--
and
that's
why
i
quoted
article
3,
section
7.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
would
if
the
facts
of
the
subsequent
litigation
supported
that
interpretation
of
the
statute.
to
the
contrary,
every
case
--
mangiapane
wasn't--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--no
other
holdings.
but
we
have
many,
many
mentions,
we
have
on-the-ground
consistent
reliance
by
prosecutors,
defense
attorneys,
and
judges.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yes.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
and
which
gets
me
to
--
to
rogers,
and
--
and
we
turn
to
the
questions
of
fundamental
fairness.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there
is
nothing.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
it
--
it
is
so
extreme,
justice
sotomayor,
that
even
in
carpenter
itself,
the
prosecution
did
not
contest
the
admissibility
of
diminished
capacity
evidence
as
a
trial
court--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
the
standard
that
this
court
set
in
rogers
is
whether
the
--
the
decision
of
carpenter,
in
this
case,
would
have
been
unforeseeable
and
indefensible
by
reference
to
the
law
as
previously
expressed
so
that
it
could
be
applied
retroactively.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
no,
the
michigan
supreme
court
did
mention
it
favorably
as
well.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
rogers?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
i
think
the
principle
that
the
court
established
there
was
very
much--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--i
think
the
closest
point,
and
it's
important,
and
it
goes,
justice
scalia,
to
respond
to
your
point
about
lower
court
--
reliance
on
lower
court
opinions,
is
in
lanier,
when
the
question
concerned
what's
the
scope
of
the
statute
that's
at
issue
here.
and
this
court
very
explicitly
stated
that
its
permissible
for
the
world
outside
of
court
to
look
at
lower
court
decisions,
court
of
appeals
decisions,
in
terms
of
what
had
been
reasonably
expressed.
that's
consistent--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--justice
kennedy,
thank
you
for
that
question,
but
i
respectfully
disagree.
the
relief
we
are
requesting
here
is
simply
that
while
the
michigan
supreme
court
was
entirely
free
to
interpret
this
statute
any
way
it
wanted
to
prospectively,
so
long
as
it
didn't
conflict
with
some
other
decision
of
this
court,
the
question
is:
what
about
applying
it
retroactively?
and
this
court
in
bouie
and
rogers
has
set
out
clear
principles
for
when
a
court
that
wants
to
reverse
ground
can
do
that
or
not,
consistent
with
fundamental
fairness,
principles
of
notice,
foreseeability,
et
cetera,
all
of
which
go
in
our
direction
here.
an
--
an
interesting
contrast,
and
i
think
a
useful
contrast--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
there's
not
a
reliance,
nor
is
that
an
element--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--in
both
--
in
both
bouie
and
rogers,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
reliance
is
not
an
issue.
the
unfairness,
and
that's
a
very
important
point,
justice
alito,
is
that
by
eliminating
the
right
to
present
this
category
of
evidence,
the
mental
health
evidence
that
would
show,
if
accepted
by
a
jury,
that
the
respondent
was
guilty
of
second-degree
murder
instead
of
first-degree
murder,
what
the
court
was
doing
was
expanding
the
--
the
scope
of
premeditation
and
deliberation;
they
were
aggravating
the
offense.
that
is
a
fundamental
unfairness.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
yeah,
i
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
except
that
at
footnote
5
in
bouie,
this
court
explicitly
rejected
the
notion
that
subjective
reliance
by
the
accused
is
--
is
even
an
aspect
of
the
test
for
determining--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--and--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--yes.
and
what
the
court
did
in
both
bouie
and
in
rogers
was
look
at
the
underlying
state
law.
in
bouie,
the
court
looked
at
the
history
of
south
carolina
law
regarding
trespass
and
found
that
until
a
year
and
a
half
later,
it
hadn't
been
construed
to
apply
to
a
failure
to
leave
as
opposed
to
an
entry.
in
rogers,
the
court
surveyed
the
very
--
a
very
sparse
tennessee
authority
on
the
year
and
a
day
rule.
that
same
analysis
here
will
--
must
lead
to
a
conclusion
that
all
of
the
law
in
michigan
--
and
again,
there
are
minimal
holdings
for
the
reasons
justice
sotomayor
indicated
--
the
minimal
holdings,
but
all
the
mentions
and
the
holding
go
in
the
direction
of
this
existed.
it
was
relied
on,
it
wasn't
contested--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--i
would
be
happy
to,
justice
alito,
but
first
i
want
to
address
your
point
about
having
to
rely
on
michigan
supreme
court's
determination
of
michigan
law,
because
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
you
can't
let
a
state
court
relabel
something
in
a
way
that
avoids
federal
constitutional
review.
chief
justice
rehnquist
spoke
to
that
point
in
collins
v.
youngblood.
justice
kennedy,
you
spoke
to
that
in
your
dissent
in
clark.
justice
scalia,
in
your
dissent
in
rogers,
you
spoke
to
the
point,
i
think,
in
an
apt
phrasing,
that
this
court
will
rely
on
a
state
court's
reasonable
determination
of
state
law.
i--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--i'm
sorry?
no.
the
majority
--
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
collins,
but
it's
also
a
well-established
principle,
and
i
also
wanted
to
note
that
the
two
other
mentions,
but
it's
not
a
principle
that's
been
in
dispute.
the
--
the
court's
analysis
in
both
bouie
and
rogers
also
supports
what
i'm
saying,
because
the
court
independently
looked
at
south
carolina
law
in
bouie.
the
court
independently
looked
at
tennessee
law
in
rogers
and--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--this
court
certainly
does
not
have
a
right
to
tell
the
michigan
supreme
court
going
forward
what
state
law
is
with
respect
to
diminished
capacity.
but--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--no.
but
this
is
not
--
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
involves
reliance--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--we're
trying
--
we're
applying
a
constitutional
principle--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--yes,
exactly.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
the
constitutional
principle
is
that
respondent
had
a
right
to
present
a
defense
that
existed
at
the
time
of
his
offense,
unless
it
was
clearly
unforeseeable
--
excuse
me
--
unless
it
was
unforeseeable
and
--
and
indefensible
by
reference
to
law
that
had
been
expressed
prior
to
the
time
of
the
conduct,
that
that
law
might
change,
which
we
don't
have
here.
and
justice
breyer,
i
think
that
the
phrasing
also
goes
to
respond
to
your
question.
the
--
the
formulation
in
--
in
rogers
that
confines
looking
to
the
law
as
of
the
time
that
the
conduct
occurred,
and
--
and
even
if
you
go
forward,
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
an
alternate
interpretation
of
the
statute,
a
questioning
opinion,
nothing
that
would
suggest
that
the
law
in
michigan
was
about
to
change.
we
also
have
the
fact
that,
unlike
the
year-and-a-day
rule,
diminished
capacity
as
--
as
a
doctrine
is
well-supported
and
increasingly
supported
by
medical
and
mental
health
evidence.
it's
the
--
the
exact
opposite
of
the
year-and-a-day
rule
in
that
regard.
it
also
furthers--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--it's
--
that's
exactly--
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
--the
unfairness
is
because
it
was
sufficiently
well-established,
it
was
thoroughly
well-established
as
a
matter
of
michigan
law,
so
respondent
and
everybody
else
in
michigan
had
a
right
to
rely
on
it.
in
fact,
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
sixth
circuit,
respondent
would
be
the
only
person
in
michigan
charged
with
a
crime
prior
to
carpenter
who
would
not
be
allowed
to
present
a
diminished
capacity
defense
at
a
fair
trial.
that's
how
extreme
the
violation
was.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
if
i
can
briefly
--
quickly
respond,
justice
breyer,
the
--
i
disagree
that
we're
--
that
i'm
in
any
way
suggesting
turning
anything
over
to
the
bar
association.
the
fact
of
that
instruction
is
i
think
strong
evidence
of
the
reasonableness
of
reliance
of
the
bench
and
bar
in
michigan,
but
not
looking
to
turn
authority
over
to
anybody.
mr.
kenneth
m.
mogill
thank
you
very
much.
