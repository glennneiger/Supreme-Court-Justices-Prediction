was
the
1973
case
that
you
mentioned
based
on
a
statute
or
was
it
based
on
allegedly
a
vacuum
that
the
statutory
structure
allowed
the
court
to
fill?
i
mean,
is
that
the
way
the
1973
case
came
about?
and
was
the
1973
case
followed
by
other
courts,
or
was
it
just
an
isolated
precedent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
states
with
a
statute
identical
or
--
or
close
to
the
michigan
statute
that
have
interpreted
the
statute
to
say
it
does
include
diminished
capacity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
statute
is
--
fairly
well
tracks
the
common
law
tradition,
which
indicates
that
diminished
capacity
is
not
a
defense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
just
curious
to
know
if
any
state
courts
have
reached
an
opposite
conclusion
under
a
statute
like
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
surprised
at
your
answer
and
justice
scalia's
question
indicates
the
same.
if
the
law
was
as
well
settled
as
you
say
it
was
in
the
appellate
courts,
then
it
seems
to
me
certainly
counsel
should
raise
it
and
is
arguably
deficient
for
not
doing
so.
whether
or
not
he'll
prevail
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
something
quite
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
--
if
you
prevail
here,
it
may
well
change
the
dynamic
for
state
supreme
courts.
state
supreme
courts,
much
like
us,
they
wait
until
courts
of
appeals
have
issued
their
opinions.
they
wait
to
see
how
the
practical
application
of
those
works
insofar
as
of
the
fairness
of
the
trial.
they
wait
to
see
about
scholarly
commentaries,
and
then
they
--
and
then
they
take
the
case.
if
you
prevail,
state
supreme
courts
are
--
are
going
to
say,
you
know,
if
we
don't
take
this
case,
even
if
though
it's
--
does
not
present
the
issue
as
clearly
as
some
other
case
might,
we
don't
rush
in,
then
we're
going
to
be
foreclosed.
i
think
you're
proposing
a
--
a
dynamic
which
makes
the
federal
courts
intrude
on
the
way
in
which
state
courts
choose
to
develop
their
law.
