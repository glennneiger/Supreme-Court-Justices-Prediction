chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-167,
united
states
v.
davila.
mr.
feigin?
it
is
feigin,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yablon?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
if
you
have
the
situation
where
the
judge
is
conveying
purely
factual
information?
there's
a
--
a
plea
bargain
on
the
table
for
one
year
and
the
judge
says,
you
should
know
that
i
--
i
have
these
cases
a
lot.
the
last
ten
cases
that
went
to
trial
where
the
defendant
was
found
guilty,
i
sentenced
them
to
a
minimum
of
12
years.
pure
facts.
the
facts
might
have
the
effect
of
pushing
the
defendant
one
way
or
another,
but
it's
also
factual
information
of
which
he
ought
to
be
aware.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
do
need
to
have
a
good
sense
of
how
far
your
--
your
per
se
structural
argument
is
going
to
reach
before
we
decide
--
in
deciding
whether
it's
appropriate
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
--
what
about
the
hypothetical
that
i
posed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
--
if
it's
my
example
and
he
says,
this
is
what
i've
done
the
past
ten
times,
so
you
ought
to
think
long
and
hard
about
whether
a
bargain
for
one
year
is
a
good
deal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
kind
of
a
fine
line
to
--
to
draw,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now
--
well,
but
you've
answered
a
lot
of
these
questions
by
saying,
you
know,
it's
hard
to
draw
the
line
and,
you
know,
maybe
in
that
case,
maybe
in
this
case.
most
--
our
precedents
where
we
recognize
structural
error
and
--
and
plain
error
are
ones
that
are
pretty
easily
categorized.
did
a
magistrate
conduct
voir
dire
or
did
he
not?
you
know
right
away
one
way
or
the
other.
did
he
participate
enough?
you
know,
well,
if
he
told
them
how
many
times
he
sentenced
people
this
way,
it's
not,
but
if
he
said
you
ought
to
--
you
ought
to
pay
attention
to
what
i'm
telling
you
when
you'd
consider
whether
to
plea
or
not,
well,
then
it
is.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
in
the
typical
plain
error
cases,
we're
very
--
the
categories
are
very
sharply
defined.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
say
in
both
of
those
examples,
the
line
--
the
gray
area,
if
you
were,
is
really
quite
narrow
than
here,
where
almost
every
time
you've
been
asked
a
question
about
a
difficult
hypothetical,
you
say,
well,
maybe,
maybe
not.
and
i
think
that's
quite
different
than
saying
is
the
court
closed
or
not
or
was
the
person
--
you
know,
did
he
represent
himself
in
fact
or
not.
and
those
just
strike
me
as
much
easier
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
if
you
were
--
if
you
were
arguing
whether
or
not
it's
--
it's
categorical
error
when
the
magistrate
conducts
voir
dire,
it'd
be
pretty
hard
for
somebody
to
come
up
with
a
tough
hypothetical.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
do
we
--
if
we're
giving
this
guidance,
what
do
we
say
about
the
fact
that
he
had
a
different
judge
subsequent
to
this,
that
he
filed
a
speedy
trial
motion
after
this
coercion,
to
suggest
that
he
wasn't
coerced
all
that
much.
are
we
supposed
to
take
all
that
into
consideration,
too?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
feigin,
13
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-167,
united
states
versus
davila.
