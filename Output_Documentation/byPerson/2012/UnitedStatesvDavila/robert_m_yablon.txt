mr.
robert
m.
yablon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
by
imploring
anthony
davila
to
forego
his
trial
rights,
confess
his
alleged
crimes,
and
accept
a
plea
deal,
the
magistrate
judge
abandoned
his
role
as
neutral
arbiter
and
fundamentally
distorted
the
pretrial
process.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
by
foregoing--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--his
trial
rights.
this
--
the
right
at
issue
in
this
case
is
not
one
that
should
be
subject
to
post
hoc
speculation.
judges,
when
an
error
of
this
kind
occurs--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--that's
--
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
first,
let's
put
to
one
side
the
fact
that
we
do
argue
that
we
should
not
be
in
a
plain
error
framework
at
all
in
this
case
because
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
judge's
improper
intervention
occurred.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
so
this
court
has--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--and
this
court
has,
at
the
very
least,
strongly
suggested
that
substantial
rights
when
you're
dealing
with
a
structural
error
are
affected,
per
se,
where
they've
left
the
door
open
to
some
additional
analysis
is
the
fourth
prong
of
the
plain
error
standard
where
the
court
is
called
upon
to
consider
whether
the
error
affects
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
the
proceedings.
and
the
government
has
never,
in
this
case,
invoked
that
fourth
prong.
they've
never
claimed
that
the
error
here
is
one
that
--
that
does
not
affect
the
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation.
so
when
you're
only
dealing
with
the
third
prong
of
the
plain
error
standard,
does
the
error
affect
substantial
rights,
that
language
is
the
same
in
rule
52(b),
the
plain
error
standard,
as
it
is
in
rule
52(a),
affects
substantial
rights,
and
if
it
means
in
rule
52(a)
that
this
is
the
sort
of
error
for
which
an
individualized
prejudice
inquiry
is
not
appropriate,
then
the
same
analysis
necessarily
carries
over
to
rule
52(b).
so
i
would
not
say
that
this
is
at
all
the
kind
of
sui
generis
example
that
--
that
you're
indicating.
and
i
do
want
to
--
to
--
and
try
to
show
that
this
error
is
quite
similar,
both
to
constitutional
and
nonconstitutional
violations
in
with
--
which
this
court
has
said
that
an
error
should
be
said
to
affect
substantial
rights
without
the
sort
of
specific
showing
of
prejudice
that
the
government
is
demanding.
when
you
have
a
judge
that,
as
in
this
case,
is
stepping
out
of
his
proper
role,
is
acting
contrary
to
his
duties
to
guard
against
ill-considered
and
involuntary
waivers
of
the
defendant's
basic
trial
rights,
is
actually
ratcheting
up
the
already
tremendous
pressure
on
the
defendant
to
plead
guilty,
that
is
a
systematic
distortion
of
the
process.
that
is
not
unlike
the
kind
of
error
that
occurs
when
a
defendant
is
denied
an
impartial
adjudicator.
it
is
not
unlike
the
kind
of
error
that
occurs
when
a
defendant
is
denied
counsel
or
is
forced
to--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--that's
right,
your
honor,
and
this
raises
a
question
about
what
the
scope
of
the
participation
prohibition
actually
is.
and
we're
in
a
strange
posture
in
this
case
because
the
government
has
conceded
that
we're
dealing
with
a
conceded
plain
violation
of
the
rule,
and
yet
their
analysis,
instead
of
proceeding
from
that
violation,
it
goes
out
to
the
periphery
and
tries
to
figure
out
where
are
the
boundaries
of
rule
11.
now
--
and
they
cite
some
appellate
cases
that
arguably
have
applied
too
broad
a
construction
of
the
rule
and
have
reversed
where
maybe
there
was
just
a
one-off
comment
or
a
purely
informational
comment,
but
it's
not
clear
that
that
is
actually
what
the
text
of
rule
11
forbids,
particularly
when
you
consider
the
context
of
the
rule
and
its
underlying
purposes.
so--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--that's
right,
your
honor,
and
there
are
--
there
are
two
ways
to
break
it
down.
one
is
we
do
argue
that
the
remedy
that
we
seek
should
apply
for
all
cases
of
judicial
participation.
and
the
question
then
is:
are
judicial
participation
violations
as
expansive
a
category
as
the
government
suggests
that
they
are?
our
second
argument
is
that--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--the
most
minor
thing
that
the
government
could
do
or
a
judge
could
do?
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
well,
the
most
minor
--
we
think
that
rule
11
is
concerned
with
judicial
pressure
to
plead
guilty.
and
so
the
most
--
i
mean,
a
judge
might
make
a
comment
that,
viewed
from
the
transcript,
would
suggest
that
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
is
overwhelming
or
that
the
defendant
is
likely
to
get
a
much
lower
sentence
if
he
pleads
guilty
than
if
he
goes
to
trial.
those
we
think
are--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--so
that
hypothetical,
if
--
if
we
were
talking
about
a
purely
informational
statement
like
that,
then,
actually,
we
don't
think
that
that
is
likely
to
be
a
violation
of
rule
11(c)(1).
and
the
reason
is,
if
you
look
at
11(b),
the
rule
expects
that
judges
are,
in
fact,
going
to
be
offering
a
lot
of
advice
to
defendants
before
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
and
so
if
a
judge
is
making
the
kinds
of
comments
that
rule
11(b)
is
contemplating,
informing
the
defendant
about
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him,
attempting
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant
understands
that
his
trial
right
is
a
real
one,
telling
the
defendant
a
little
bit
about
what,
in
fact,
the
--
the
sentencing
exposure
might
be
if
he
is
convicted,
those
purely
informational
statements
we
don't
think
is
what
is
meant
to
be
prohibited
by
the
rule.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
so
--
and
--
and
this
is
getting
--
and
then
the
judge
may
well
be
crossing
the
line.
and
what
the
judge--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--there's
no
question
that
there
will
be
close
cases.
i
would
say
that
if
you
look
to
the
majority
of
cases
that
are
actually
out
there,
most
judges,
of
course,
are
very
scrupulous
about
following
the
rule.
and
when
a
judge
is
not,
the
judge
is
not
usually
being
circumspect
about
it,
the
judge
is
trying
to
get
a
message
across
to
the
defendant.
and
so
there
may
be
difficult
line-drawing
cases,
and
that's
true
whether
you're
looking
at
the
remedial
approach
that
we're
asking
for
or
the
remedial
approach
that
the
government's
asking
for.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
and
at
no
point
during
the
plea
colloquy
hearing
is
the
district
judge
in
any
way
acknowledging
or
disavowing
the
magistrate
judge's
comments,
which,
we
submit,
there
is
at
least
a
very
strong
probability
that
those
comments
affected
the
defendant's
thinking
and
the
reason
that
the
defendant
is
at
the
rule
11
hearing
in
the
first
place.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
and,
of
course,
in
that
situation,
the
defendant
is
likely
not
thinking
about
pressure
that
may
come
from
the
judiciary
itself.
and
also,
not
to
nitpick
but
when
he's
asking
that
pressure
question
he's
asking
whether
anyone
pressured
him
to
plead
guilty
today,
which
may
not
cause
the
defendant
to
think
back
on
why
he
started
down
the
negotiation
road.
i
think
an
important--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--that
statement
reveals
just
how
little
confidence
we
actually
should
have
in
the
plea
decision
that
he
made.
here
is
a
defendant
who
for
the
better
part
of
a
year
was
adamant
about
his
desire
to
go
to
trial
and
exercise
his
rights.
it's
the
reason
that
the
in
camera
hearing
happened
in
the
first
place,
because
he
was
unhappy
that
the
lawyer
just
wanted
him
to
plead
guilty.
after
that
hearing,
suddenly
there
are
plea
negotiations
and
a
plea
deal,
which
it's
clear
that
he
is
never
happy
about
from
the
start.
even
at
the
plea
hearing,
he
is
attempting
to
tell
the
judge:
look,
i
don't
think
that
my
conduct
actually
is
consistent
with
the
conspiracy
charge
as
alleged.
and
he
says
later
at
the
sentencing
hearing
when
they
are
discussing
the
withdrawal
motion
that
basically
he
went
forward
because
his
lawyer
was
instructing
him
that
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
and
if
you
look
at
that
sentencing--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--and
we
don't
need
to
prove
that.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
either
way,
if
you
were
looking
at
whether
this
conduct
should
be
viewed
as
inherently
prejudicial
the
reason
that
you
might
do
that
is
because
you
might
think
that
at
least
in
all
of
these
cases
there
might
at
least
be
a
reasonable
probability
that
it
would
affect
where
the
defendant
is.
and
here
you
have
a
defendant
who
has
been
adamant
that
he's
not
going
to
plead,
and
when
you
have
the
judge
making
these
comments
in
front
of
the
defendant,
having
him
lose
confidence
in
his
right
to
go
to
trial,
then
it's
likely
that
that
is
shifting
the
defendant's
mind
set
in
a
way
that
gets
him
to
the
negotiating
table.
and
it
also
reaffirms
the
defense
lawyer's
position
in
this
case.
and
so
you
have
a
defense
lawyer
who
may
then
go
back
to
the
prosecutor
and
say:
we're
just
going
to
get
this
deal
done,
and
it
may
not
be
the
deal
that
the
defendant
would
otherwise
have
wanted
reached.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
let
me
address
that
in
two
ways,
because
we
have
two
separate
arguments
and
i
want
to
try
to
keep
them
distinct.
one
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
text
and
the
history
of
rule
11,
there
is
strong
evidence
that
congress
actually
made
an
affirmative
judgment
not
to
sweep
in
rule
11
violations
within
the
scope
of
rule
11(h).
our
second
argument
is
even
if
rule
11(h)
applies
to
all
rule
11
errors,
that
all
rule
11(h)
does
is
apply
the
same
substantial
rights
language
that
you
see
in
rule
52(a)
and
(b).
and
this
court
has
recognized
that,
while
that
substantial
rights
language
is
often
synonymous
with
a
case
of
specific
prejudice
inquiry,
that's
not
always
true.
and
there
are
a
number
of
examples.
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
constitutional
cases
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
an
error
is
structural
without
trying
to
determine,
make
a
case-specific
determination
of
prejudice.
but
there
are
a
number
of
nonconstitutional
cases
as
well
in
which
the
court
has
said
an
individualized
prejudice
inquiry
is
simply
inappropriate,
that
the
error
affects
substantial
rights
by
its
nature.
so
one
example
that
i
think
is
fairly
close
to
the
one
we
have
here
is
gomez
v.
united
states,
where
you
have
the
court
addressing
a
statutory
provision
that
prevents
magistrate
judges
from
conducting
the
jury
voir
dire
and
that
proviso
is
violated
and
the
court
is
asked
to
conduct
a
prejudice
analysis:
did
it
matter
that
the
magistrate
judge
conducted
voir
dire?
and
the
court
said:
we
are
not
going
to
go
there;
this
is
in
effect
a
structural
defect
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
first,
justice
sotomayor,
this
court
has
said
that
rules
of
criminal
--
i'm
so,
sorry--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--and
i
should
be--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--that
makes
it
that
much
more
embarrassing.
she
used
to
sit
over
there.
this
court
has
said
that
federal
rules
and
statutes
stand
on
equal
footing,
so
whether
we
are
talking
about
applying
this
with
respect
to
a
rule
or
a
statute,
it
shouldn't
make
a
difference;
the
analysis
should
be
the
same.
and
in
fact
there
is
at
least
one
case
where
the
court
did
apply
in
effect
the
structural
analysis
to
--
to
a
rule
violation
and
a
second
case
in
which
the
court
at
least
left
open
the
possibility.
so
the
case
in
which
the
court
did
so
is
the
mccarthy
case,
which
is
discussed
extensively
in
the
briefs.
the
court
referred
to
the
1966
version
of
rule
11
and
said
that
prejudice
adheres
in
a
violation
of
that
rule
and
that
it
was
not
going
to
conduct
an
individualized
analysis.
it
was
simply
going
to
grant
relief
where
there
had
not
been
full
compliance
with
that
provision.
of
course,
the
rule
has
been
amended
since
then,
but
that
provides
evidence
that
the
court
is
not
unwilling
to
adopt
this
kind
of
rule
in
the
context
of
the
federal
rules.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
so
we
think
that
our
approach
is
consistent
with
how
the
rule
is
in
fact
meant
to
be
interpreted.
the
rule
really
is
about
this
problem
of
placing
judicial
pressure
on
defendants
to
plead
guilty,
and
those
are
the
cases
that
ought
to
be
reversed.
but
the
court
has
a
line-drawing
decision
to
make
either
way.
either
the
line
that
the
court
should
focus
on
is
the
line
that
separates
participation
from
nonparticipation
or,
again,
a
narrower
class
of
participation.
and
i
want
to
get
to
this
point
that--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--i
believe
there
are
some
decisions
out
that
have
adopted
probably
a
broader
construction
than
we
think
is
necessary
and
appropriate.
but
what
is
easier
for
reviewing
courts
to
monitor?
is
it
easier
for
them
to
monitor
the
narrowing,
the
improper
narrowing
of
the
rule
over
time,
or
is
it
easier
for
them
to
monitor
improper
applications
of
the
harmless
error
rule,
especially
applications
of
it
that
are
happening
in
this
kind
of
setting,
where
it's
going
to
be
almost
inherently
a
very
speculative
analysis,
an
attempt
to
read
the
defendant's
mind
and
ascertain
whether
the
defendant
was
influenced
by
what
the
judge
was
saying.
and
it
would
be
much
easier
for
appellate
courts
to
focus
on
the
line-drawing
exercise
that
determines
whether
or
not
a
violation
had
occurred
or,
if
you
think
that
the
rule
is
broader,
whether
the
kind
of
violation
that
occurred
in
this
case
occurred,
than
it
would
be
to
try
to
make
this
case-by-case
scouring
the
record,
individualized
prejudice
determinations.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
so
there
ought
to
be
things
that
a
judge
is
able
to
do
in
that
situation.
suppose,
for
example,
that
the
judge
becomes
aware
that
the
defense
attorney
has
given
the
--
his
client
false
information
about
the
elements
of
the
charge.
it
would
not
violate
rule
11(c)(1)
for
the
judge
to
say:
i
understand
that
you
were
told
that
the
elements
of
the
charge
are
a,
b,
and
c,
but
in
fact
they
are
x,
y,
and
z.
so
there
are
--
there
are
certainly
steps
that
a
judge
can
take
to
help
root
out
the
violation.
and
i
would
say
that
the
fact
is
that
generally
when
it
comes
to
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
there
is
only
so
much
that
the
trial
could
court
can
do.
so
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
may
not
be
able
to
solve
or
prevent
every
ineffective
assistance
claim
in
this
context
is
not
necessarily
an
argument
against
the
rule,
because
the
judge
often
is
not
aware
of
the
privileged
communications.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
well,
the
judge's
role
in
that
situation
is
--
is
not
to
step
in
as
defense
counsel
or,
in
effect,
as
second
prosecutor.
the
judge
--
i
think
that
there
may
be
ways
in
that
case
for
the
judge
to
try
to
alleviate
the
error
without
--
without
crossing
the
line.
but
when
--
but
when
you
start
to
make
exceptions
in
that
--
in
that
situation,
you
--
you
go
down
the
road
of
--
of
the
judge
being
the
one
who
is
evaluating
the
evidence
and
who
is,
in
effect,
potentially
presuming
the
defendant's
guilt.
and
the
judge--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--and
if
this
is
happening
in
the
context
of
active
discussions
of
whether
the
defendant
should
or
should
not
take
a
plea,
then
that
--
that
may
well
cross
the
line.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
i
think
--
isn't
it
the
opposite,
justice
kennedy?
the
colloquy
happens
after
the
defendant--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--so
--
so
taking
--
so
in
that
instance,
again,
you
have
a
situation
that
may
not
be
different
from
situations
that
arise
in
completely
different
contexts,
where
the
attorney
is
doing
something
that's
ineffective,
for
example,
and
the
judge
just
doesn't
know
about
it.
and
--
and
whether
or
not
that
can
be
cured
in
this
--
in
this
setting
of
the
--
of
plea
discussions,
it's
just
a
little
bit
tangential,
i
think,
to
the
key
issue.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
that's
actually
not
accurate.
i
would
say,
for
example,
take
the
defendant's
right
to
self-representation.
and
do
you
--
there
may
be
obvious
cases
and
when
the
defendant's
right
to
self-representation
has
been
clearly
denied.
but
there
are
going
to
be
line-drawing
problems
when
you're
trying
to
figure
out
did
standby
counsel
intervene
so
much
that
he
denied
that
right.
or
similarly
with
the
public
trial,
obviously,
a
court
can
be
totally
closed,
but
then
there
are
going
to
be
difficult
cases
when
you
have
to
decide
whether
the
justifications
for
closing
the
courtroom
are--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--and,
of
course,
i'm
being
asked
all
of
the
difficult
hypotheticals.
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
actually
rise--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--in
that
instance,
yes.
but
there
certainly
are
instances
in
which
the
structural
--
in
which
the
court
has
found
structural
error,
even
when
there
will
be
difficult
line-drawing
problems.
and--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--your
honor,
no
jurisdiction
endorses
judicial
exhortations
to
plead
guilty.
and
--
and
so
this
court
can
resolve
the
case
just
on
that
narrower
basis,
that
there
is
a
category
of
cases
that
clearly
do
involve
direct
judicial
pressure.
and
no
state
allows
it,
and
those
are
clear
violations
of
the
rules.
so
without
needing
to
draw
these
other
lines
about
how
broad
participation
may
reach,
the
court
can
do
that.
but
even
in
those
states,
it's
important
to
note
that
--
that
the
federal
system
has
made
a
different
structural
choice.
so
whether
or
not
it
may
violate
the
constitution
for
states
to
have
carefully
tailored
procedures
that
allow
some
type
of
judicial
involvement,
that's
not
the
structure
that
the
federal
system
has
chosen.
and
when
you're
dealing
with
the
structural
choice
that
was
made
in
rule
11,
that
judges
shall
not,
must
not
participate
in
plea
discussions,
that
that
is
as
elemental
to
the
federal
system
of
plea
bargaining
that
we
have
as
many
of
the
familiar
elements
of
--
of
the
trial
are.
and
so,
the
fact
that
states
have
made
--
made
different
structural
choices
does
not
mean
that
it's
not
a
structural
error
here.
now,
i
do
want
to
get
back
to
this
line-drawing
issue,
because
i
think
that
this
is
not
something
that
should
trouble
the
court
too
much,
for
a
couple
of
reasons:
first,
in
most
cases,
the
line
will
not
be
that
hard
to
draw
when
you
consider
the
purpose
of
rule
11(c)(1),
which
is
reducing
judicial
pressure,
and
instances
in
which
judges
are
stepping
out
of
their
role
as
impartial
adjudicators,
and
when
reviewing
courts
take
that
as
the
touchstone,
there
may
be
difficult
cases,
but
they're
going
to
be
able
to
resolve
most
of
them.
now,
if
the
court
feels
like
it
may
be
difficult
to
do
line
drawing,
and
it
is
uncomfortable
extending
the
rule,
the
remedy
that
we're
seeking
that
far,
it
is
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
--
to
take
out
a
subcategory
of
rule
11(c)(1)
violations.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
it
would
factor
into
the
prejudice
analysis
that
the
court
undertakes,
but
it
also
is
a
reason
just
to
--
to
draw
the
line.
i
mean,
this
court
in
--
in
various
instances
has
indicated
that
--
i
mean,
there
are
some
--
some
broad
rules
out
there:
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
it
comes
in
different
shapes.
and
the
prejudice
analysis
that
applies
for
a
total
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel
is
different
from
the
one
that
applies
when
you're
dealing
with
mere
deficiency
in
counsel's
performance.
and
there
is
--
and
again,
this
is
--
this
is
a
comparative
line-drawing
problem.
either
you
draw
the
line
looking
at
what
a
violation
is
or
looking
at
what
a
judicial
exhortation
is
from
the
statement
that
is
made,
or
you
engage
in
this
freewheeling
speculation
that
the
government
wants
engaged
in,
where
you
were
trying
to
read
the
defendant's
mind.
and
that
is
simply
not
how
harmless
error
analysis
normally
proceeds,
where
you
have
a
closed
universe
of
a
record,
you
have
specific
criteria
that
are
being
applied,
and
you
can
posit
what
a
reasonable
juror
is.
there
is
no
reasonable
defendant
that
can
be
posited
in
the
same
way,
because
defendants
are
idiosyncratic
and
are
entitled
to
be
idiosyncratic.
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
the
answer
is
no,
and
that
would
be
--
and
we
would
urge
the
court
that
if
it
does
not
accept
our
primary
submission,
that
it
make
clear
that
judicial
exhortations
like
this
are
highly
unlikely
to
be
harmless.
that
is
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
done,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit,
the
tenth
circuit,
the
d.c.
circuit.
they
are
in
effect
applying
a
per
se
analysis,
they're
just
not
calling
it
that.
they
are
reversing
in
all
of
these
cases.
and
so,
if
this
court
is
uncomfortable
calling
it
a
per
se
rule,
at
least
it
should
give
very
strong
indications
that
comments
like
this
cannot
be
written
off,
that
they
are
highly
likely,
given
the
position
of
the
judge
relative
to
the
defendant,
to
affect
the
defendant's
thinking,
to
affect
the
way
that
the
defense
counsel
approaches
the
case,
and
possibly
the
prosecution
as
well
in
those
cases
in
which
the
prosecution
is
aware
of
the
error.
and
we
would
go
further
and
say
that
if
the
court
were
to
go
down
this
road,
it
would
be
useful
for
the
court
to
provide
the
additional
guidance
of
holding
that
this
particular
type
of
error
was
not
harmless.
that
would
send
a
signal
to
the
lower
courts
that
this
conduct
is
clearly
off
limits,
and
it
would
give
them
an
indication
that
the
court
means
what
it's
saying,
that
these
kind
of
comments,
where
a
judge
is
exhorting
a
defendant
to
come
to
the
cross,
that
he
needs
to
plead
guilty--
mr.
robert
m.
yablon
--you
should
say
that
those
inferences
are
not
adequate
to
overcome
the
inference
that
you
draw
from
this
type
of
participation,
particularly
here.
i
mean,
consider
the
change
in
judge.
the
reason
this
hearing
occurred
before
the
magistrate
judge
is
because
the
defendant
sent
a
letter
to
the
district
court
asking
--
explaining
his
problems
with
his
counsel.
he
got
a
response
from
the
magistrate
judge.
so
in
the
defendant's
mind,
the
magistrate
judge
and
the
district
court
are
effectively
one
and
the
same,
and
you
would
not
want
a
system
where
district
courts
are
encouraged
to
send
these
issues
to
magistrate
judges,
so
magistrate
judges
can
engage
in
these
kind
of
comments,
but
then
the
district
judge
can
basically
just
cleanse
it.
it
is
going
to
affect
the
way
that
the
process
plays
out.
now,
the
speedy
trial
issue,
if
i
may
just
--
we
can
equally
draw
the
inference
that
that
was
only
done
because
counsel
wanted
to
put
some
pressure
on
the
government
to
actually
reach
a
deal.
and
it
is
that
kind
of
speculation
that
makes
this
error
ill-suited
to
the
kind
of
remedial
analysis
the
government
favors.
