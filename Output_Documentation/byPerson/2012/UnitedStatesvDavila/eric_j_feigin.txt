mr.
eric
j.
feigin
yes,
your
honor,
thank
you.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals'
practice
of
automatically
granting
appellate
relief
for
every
violation
of
rule
11(c)(1),
irrespective
whether
it
prejudiced
the
defendant,
is
flawed.
as
this
court
recognized
in
united
states
v.
vaughn,
rule
11(h)
was
adopted
for
the
precise
purpose
of
ending
the
then-common
practice
of
automatically
reversing
even
for
non-prejudicial
rule
11
errors.
it
would
be
especially
inappropriate
to
apply
an
automatic
reversal
rule
in
a
case
like
this
one
that
comes
to
the
appellate
courts
in
a
plain
error
posture.
erroneous
judicial
participation--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i'd
respectfully
disagree
with
the
notion
that
just
because
respondent's
counsel
was
advising
him
to
plead
guilty,
that
respondent's
counsel
had
so
advocated
--
so
abdicated
his
representation
that
he
couldn't
be
expected
to
object
to
an
error
that
the
judge
made.
i'd
also
point
out
that
if
the
court
were
to
create
an
exception
to
the
plain
error
doctrine,
this
would
be
a
particularly
inappropriate
case
in
which
to
do
it
because
not
only
was
there
not
a
contemporaneous
objection,
there
wasn't
an
objection
before
the
district
judge
in
the
months
and
proceedings
that
followed.
they
didn't
raise
any
claim
of
error
on
appeal
until
the
court
of
appeals
raised
it.
and
in
fact,
in
this
case,
respondent
did
file
a
motion
in
the
district
court
to
withdraw
his
plea.
and
he
didn't
mention
the
magistrate's
comments
or
any
pressure
he
felt
from
those
comments
at
all.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
if
respondent
wants
to
make
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
on
collateral
review,
he
can
make
that.
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
court
of
appeals
that
has
abandoned
the
plain
error
doctrine
in
this
kind
of
case
and
i
don't
think
there
should
be
any
sort
of
special
exception
that
says
when
--
that
we
assume
when
counsel
is
advising
his
client
to
plead
guilty,
that
we
can't
expect
counsel
to
make
objections
to
errors
that
occur
based
on
the
judge's
comments.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
let
me
just
say
one
other
word
about
that.
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
easy
for
courts
of
appeals
to
tell
exactly
why
the
lawyer
may
not
have
made
an
objection,
and
i
just
don't
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
in
every
rule
11(c)(1)
case
that
the
lawyer
is
effectively
acting
at
contrary
purposes
to
his
client.
i
mean,
lawyers
advise
clients
to
plead
guilty
all
the
time
and
that
doesn't
mean
that
they've
abandoned
the
representation
to
the
point
where
you
can't
assume
they're
acting
on
the
client's
behalf
and
will
raise
objections.
but
our
basic
point
in
this--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that's
exactly
right,
justice
sotomayor.
that
was
exactly
the
next
sentence
that
was
going
to
come
out
of
my
mouth
is
that
our
basic
point
in
this
case
is
that
you
have
to
apply
prejudice
analysis
in
some
form,
and
whether
it's
harmless
error
or
plain
error,
the
court
of
appeals
refuses
to
do
it.
and
we
think--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
want
to
take
issue
with
the
notion
that
all
rule
11(c)(1)
errors
are
alike.
there's
actually
a
variety
of
different
kinds
of
rule
11(c)(1)
errors.
rule
11(c)(1)
has
been
held
to
cover,
for
example,
a
judge
pressuring
the
government
outside
the
defendant's
presence
to
offer
a
plea,
a
judge
discouraging
a
plea,
a
judge
commenting
in
a
well-intentioned
manner
about
the
obvious
difference
in
potential
sentencing
consequences
between
a
potential
plea
agreement
and
a
trial,
or
a
judge,
having
rejected
one
plea
agreement
that
the
parties
reached,
indicating
a
bit
too
strongly
what
kind
of
plea
agreement
the
judge
might
accept.
i
think
adopting
some
sort
of
“
one
size
fits
all
”
rule
would
--
would
be
inappropriate,
and
the
rebuttable
presumption
i
think
would
also
be
inappropriate,
for
a
few
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
courts
should
have
to
distinguish
between
different
types
of
errors
to
see
whether
a
rebuttable
presumption
should
apply.
second
of
all--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
think
that's
already
built
into
rule
52
in
a
couple
of
different
ways.
first
of
all,
rule
52
places
a
presumption
based
on
whether
or
not
the
defendant
objected.
if
the
defendant
objected,
the
burden's
on
the
government.
if
the
defendant
didn't
object,
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant.
but
also,
i
don't
--
i
want
to
be
clear
on
this:
the
type
of
error
--
if
there
is
a
very
serious
error,
the
nature
of
the
error
and
the
error's
seriousness
would
of
course
be
a
factor,
and
a
very
important
factor,
in
the
prejudice
analysis.
but,
as
your
honor
has
recognized
with
this
case,
there
may
be
other
circumstances
that
indicate
that
the
error
did
not
in
this
case
have
a
reasonable
probability
of
affecting
the
decision
of
the
plea.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i
have
thought
about
that
a
little
bit,
your
honor,
and
i'd
say
that
trying
to
break
rule
11(c)(1)
into
different
pieces
and
adopt
different
rules
based
on
different
kinds
of
error
would
be
inappropriate,
for
three
main
reasons.
the
first
one
is
i
think
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
position
in
neder
v.
the
united
states,
which
makes
clear
that
in
deciding
whether
an
error
is
structural
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
class
of
errors.
and
rule
11(c)(1)
defines
the
class
of
errors
as
cases
in
which
a
judge
participates
in
plea
negotiations
in
some
way,
and
it
doesn't
define
subcategories.
second,
i
think
breaking
this
up
into
pieces
would
essentially
be
an
incomplete
and
unsatisfactory
form
of
prejudice
analysis.
that
is,
reviewing
courts
would
still
be
looking
at
errors
and
differentiating
between
them
in
order
to
decide
whether
relief
is
warranted,
but
they
would
be
narrowly
focused
only
on
the
binary
inquiry
of
how
to
categorize
the
error,
they'd
be
disregarding
how
serious
that
particular
error
was
versus
other
errors
in
that
category,
and
they
would
be
disregarding
all
the
other
facts
and
circumstances
the
courts
always
look
at
and
are
well
familiar
with
how
to
look
at
in
a
normal
prejudice
analysis,
to
determine
whether
the
error
affected
the
outcome.
third,
particularly
because
the
subcategories
don't
exist
in
the
rule
and
would
be
something
of
judicial
invention,
i
think
that
approach
would
be
inherently
inadministrable
and
manipulatable
and
lead
to
inconsistent
results.
it
could
be
very
difficult
to
tell
whether
a
particular
type
of
error
should
fall
into
one
category
or
another,
and
under
the
approach
you're
suggesting,
which
i
think
is
the
approach
respondent
is
advocating
--
i
don't
think
respondent
is
actually
advocating
the
per
se
rule
that
the
eleventh
circuit
adopted
here
--
i
think
under
that
approach,
you
know,
everything
turns
on
a
narrow
question
of
categorization.
i
think
the
much
better
approach,
and
the
approach
that
rule
52
adopts,
is
to
look
at
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
to
attempt
to
determine
the
effect
on
the
outcome.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
certainly,
your
honor.
we
--
the
government
loses
many
of
these
cases
even
in
circuits
that
have
prejudice
analysis.
in
fact,
one
example
the
court
might
want
to
look
to,
there
was
a
certiorari
petition
i
think
filed
at
the
end
of
last
term,
a
case,
11-8966,
rebollo-andino,
which
was
a
case
of
rule
11(c)(1)
error.
the
government
conceded
that
even
on
a
plain
error
analysis
that
that
was
prejudicial.
i
can
describe--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
let
me
take
--
let
me
take
a
different
example.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
united
states
v.
bradley,
the
judge
essentially
told
the
defendants
that
he
--
it
boggled
his
mind
that
they
were
going
to
trial
and
kept
essentially
harassing
them
about
why
they
were
going
to
trial.
and,
eventually,
they
said,
all
right,
your
honor,
we
are
going
to
--
we're
going
to
plead
guilty.
i
mean,
that
kind
of
thing
obviously
is
going
to
be
prejudicial.
but
the
advantage
of
a
prejudice
approach
is
it
allows
you
to
separate
that
kind
of
case
from
kinds
of
cases
when
there
are
less
serious
errors,
or
even
a
case
where
there
is
a
fairly
serious
error
--
and
this
case
may
fall
within
that
category
--
but
there
are
facts
and
circumstances
that
indicate
that
the
error
didn't
have
a
reasonable
probability
of
affecting
the
defendant's
decision
to
plead.
and
while
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
resolve
the
prejudice
analysis
here
in
the
first
instance,
we
--
we're
just
asking
the
court
to
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
that,
i
think
it's
just
worth
noting
that
--
a
couple
of
the
factors.
one
is
that
--
there
was
a
3-month
break
between
the
magistrate
judge's
comments
and
the
entry
of
the
plea,
and
a
month
into
that
a
speedy
trial
motion
was
filed,
which
indicated
at
least
some
intent
at
that
point
to
go
to
trial.
the
plea
and
the
sentencing
occurred
in
front
of
the
district
judge,
not
the
magistrate
judge
who
made
the
comments.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i
don't
--
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
in
the
record
that
reflects
whether
he
did
or
did
not.
there's
never
been
an
allegation
that
--
that
he
said
something
about
them,
or
that
he
was
aware
of
them
or--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
my
understanding
is
the
government
was
not
aware
of
this
because
it
occurred
in
an
ex
parte
hearing
in
which
the
government
wasn't
in
attendance.
the
government
wasn't
aware
of
it
until
the
eleventh
circuit
conducted
its
own
review
of
the
record
and
asked
for
further
briefing
on
the
issue.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
yes,
your
honor.
he
has
a
right
to
go
to
trial
if
he
wants
to
go
to
trial,
even
if
it
would
be
crazy.
so
under
that
circumstance,
if
he
wouldn't
have,
you
know,
pleaded
guilty
without
the
erroneous
comments
from
the
judge,
there
would
be
prejudice.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
this
actually
happened
in
a
non-hypothetical
fashion
in
a
case
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
called
in
re
united
states,
in
which
the
judge
was
apparently
unhappy
with
the
government's
conduct
in
that
case
and
had
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
in
chambers,
or
at
least
in
court,
without
the
defendant's
presence,
and
was
urging
the
parties
to
reach
a
plea
agreement.
i
think
if
something
like
that
happens,
your
honor,
there'd
be
some
question
whether
the
defendant
was
made
aware
of
it,
and
whether
it
actually
influenced
the
defendant's
decision
to
plead.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
a
presumption
that
just
because
counsel
heard
it,
that
necessarily--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--so
--
your
honor,
i
think
one
of
our
main
concerns
in
bringing
this
case
before
the
court
is
the
interaction
of
this
court's
decisions
in
lafler
and
frye
with
rule
11(c)(1),
and
frye
suggests
that
one
way
a
judge
can
try
to
guard
against
a
later
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
is
to
conduct
a
colloquy
with
the
defendant
--
not
a
colloquy,
but
a
discussion
with
the
defendant
--
during
the
initial
proceedings
to
try
to
establish
that
he
understands
the
consequences
of
his
plea
and
that
he's
receiving
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
i
think
that
could
be
done
very
carefully
by
asking
very
general
questions,
but
i
think
it's
very
easy
to
see
how
a
judge
might
slip
up
and
say,
oh,
that's
an
interesting
offer.
did
you
discuss
that
with
your
counsel?
that
seems
like
something
you
ought
to
discuss
with
your
counsel.
and
i
think
what
the
automatic
reversal
rule
the
court
of
appeals
has
adopted
is
it
really
puts
judges,
and,
frankly,
the
government,
in
kind
of
a
box.
on
the
one
hand,
judges
have
to
guard
against
these
later
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
by
discussing
plea
discussions,
and
on
the
other
hand,
any
slipup
in
that
discussion
is
going
to
lead
to
automatic
reversal
on
appeal.
now,
i
--
i
just
want
to
add
one
--
one
more
thing,
which
is,
i
think,
the
best
evidence
that
we
have
that
this
--
the
magistrate
judge's
comments
here
did
not
create
a
reasonable
probability
of
effecting
the
defendant's
decision
to
plead
is,
again,
defendant
himself
moved
pro
se
to
withdraw
his
plea
in
the
district
court,
and
his
reasons
for
withdrawing
his
plea,
which
start
on
page
58
of
the
joint
appendix,
never
mention
the
magistrate's
comments.
instead,
in
his
own
words,
what
he
says
is,
"your
honor,
my
decision
to
enter
the
plea
was
a
strategic
decision.
"
"the
reason
being
is
that
i
knew
that
the
prosecutor
had
a
duty
with
the
courts
to
disclose
the
information
relevant
for
this
court's
determination
of
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
the
plea.
"
and
what
he
means
by
that
is
that
he
took
issue
with
some
aspects
of
the
allegations
in
the
indictment,
although
he's
quite
clear,
both
in
that
proceeding
and
at
his
guilty
plea
proceeding,
that
he
did
commit
the
conspiracy
offense,
and
he
just
believed
that
those
allegations
in
the
record
would
be
cleaned
up
or
have
to
be
withdrawn
by
the
prosecutor
if
he
pleaded
guilty.
now,
he
was
wrong
about
that.
but
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
clear
unvarnished
explanation
by
the
defendant
in
his
own
words
about
why
he
pleaded
that
doesn't
mention
the
magistrate's
comments.
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
disregarding
that.
and
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
make
one
quick
point
in
response
to
the
notion
that
we're
asking
for
some
form
of
new
prejudice
analysis
here.
this
is
the
exact
same
prejudice
analysis
from
dominguez
benitez,
that
looks
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
error
affected
the
plea.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
will
rest--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
am
aware
of
one
or
two
state
cases
in
which
the
court
has
looked
at
the
passage
of
time
as
a
reason
why
that
kind
of
error
wouldn't
have
been
prejudicial.
but
otherwise,
i
agree
with
respondent
that
in
the
federal
courts
of
appeals,
that
does
tend
to
get
reversed.
and
i
think
that
supports
the
idea
that
if
the
court
adopts
the
normal
prejudice
approach,
and
reaffirms
that
approach
in
this
case,
that
there's
not
really
that--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
there
--
my
--
i'm
not
going
to
go
so
far
as
to
endorse
the
results
they've
reached
in
every
single
case--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--but
i
think
insofar
as
they
approach
the
matter
that
--
you
know,
if
there's
a
fairly
serious
error
and
the
defendant
pleads
guilty
right
after
that,
that
that's
very
likely
