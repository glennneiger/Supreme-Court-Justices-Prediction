well,
suppose
you
just
stick
with
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical,
or
perhaps
not
even
a
hypothetical,
what
happened
in
this
case.
just
assume
that
the
defense
attorney
likes
this
judicial
intervention
and
he
--
he
wants
this
to
take
place.
it
--
it
seems
quite
unfair
to
talk
about
the
plain
error,
because
he
doesn't
tell
--
as
justice
ginsburg
says,
what
does
the
defendant
know
about
rule
11(c)?
he
doesn't
know
about
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
--
what
happens
under
--
under
the
rule
if
the
magistrate
asked
that
the
defendant
be
excused
--
i
don't
know
quite
how
you
do
that;
the
defendant
has
to
be
present.
but
can
the
--
can
the
judge
just
have
the
attorneys
before
him
and
say,
now,
i
want
you
to
be
very,
very
clear
that
this
is
a
mandatory
minimum,
that
we
should
try
to
avoid
if
at
all
possible.
can
he
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
awfully
hard
to
have
a
hypothetical
where
you
exclude
the
defendant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
opening
because
i
think
--
i
just
didn't
hear
your
first
--
“
by
foregoing
”?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
by
foregoing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
when
it
can
happen,
because
there's
no
colloquy
when
there's
a
guilty
plea.
the
colloquy
happens
when
there's
a
not
guilty
plea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no
--
you're
correct.
you're
correct.
