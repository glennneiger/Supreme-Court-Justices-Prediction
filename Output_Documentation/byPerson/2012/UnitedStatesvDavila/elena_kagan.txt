well,
on
that,
what's
the
most
minor
thing
that
the
government
could
do
that
would
still
count
as
a
rule
11(c)(1)
violation?
justice
elena
kagan
that
the
judge
could
do.
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
yablon,
have
we
ever
said
that
about
the
violation
of
a
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
that
it's
structural
error
no
matter
what
the
circumstances?
justice
elena
kagan
you
worked
for
her,
too,
i
think.
justice
elena
kagan
i
would
think,
mr.
yablon,
that
one
of
the
effects
of
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do
is
that
the
rule
would
just
get
narrower
and
narrower.
in
other
words,
if
automatic
reversal
is
always
the
effect
of
finding
a
violation
--
and
i
think
you
acknowledge
this
in
a
way
--
that
people
will
just
find
fewer
and
fewer
violations.
and
i'm
wondering
why
we
should
do
something
like
that
rather
than
interpret
the
rule
as
it
was
meant
to
be
interpreted,
but
then
say:
you
know,
somebody
can
look
and
say
it
really
just
didn't
matter
that
it
was
violated
in
this
case.
justice
elena
kagan
but
that
seems
a
bit
odd,
don't
you
think,
mr.
yablon?
you
know,
you're
saying,
well,
there
are
core
violations
as
opposed
to
noncore
violations.
i
mean,
presumably,
that's
part
of
what
the
court
would
think
about
when
it
was
doing
prejudice
analysis.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
yablon,
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
there
is
one
of
these
core
violations,
these
exhortation
cases,
where
the
court
did
not
find
prejudice?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
feigin,
can
i
ask
you
the
same
question
that
i
asked
mr.
yablon:
do
you
know
of
any
cases
where
in
these
--
where
there
are
really
core
violations,
where
a
judge
exhorts
the
defendant
to
plea
it
--
does
the
court
ever
find
that
non-prejudicial?
