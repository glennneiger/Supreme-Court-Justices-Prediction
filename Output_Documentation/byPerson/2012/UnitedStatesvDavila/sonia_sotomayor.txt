it
doesn't
really
matter--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--excuse
me.
does
this
issue
go
--
it
doesn't
go
to
whether
you
should
apply
the
prejudice
prong,
because
either
under
normal
harmless
error
or
plain
error
you
have
to
get
to
whether
it
prejudices
someone.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
one
of
the
most
powerful
arguments
of
your
adversary
is
that
in
the
most
common
of
situations
--
and
it's
how
i
read
the
advisory
notes
--
it's
going
to
be
awfully
difficult
to
say
that
a
judge's
intervention
hasn't
influenced
a
defendant.
this
is
the
unusual
case
where
you
might
actually
have
a
no
prejudice
argument
because
of
the
unique
facts.
but
there
is
a
purpose
for
keeping
judges
out
of
this,
and
that's
because
the
subtle
influence
that
judges
exert
is
not
so
subtle.
it's
very
palpable
and
does
influence
most
decision
making,
both
by
lawyers
and
defendants.
so
if
that's
the
standard,
why
isn't
it
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
prejudice
exists?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
has
to
be
an
awfully
high
presumption,
otherwise,
you
make
mockery
of
the
rule,
in
my
mind.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
don't
disagree
that
one
doesn't'
have
to
use
the
word
“
rebuttable
presumption
”,
but
there
has
to
be
a
strong
prejudice
factor--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--whether
rebuttable
or
not,
assumed
in
a
judge's
intervention.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
creating
a
sui
generis
structural
error
analysis.
you're
basically
--
because
even
with
respect
to
constitutional
violations
that
we
have
found
structural
error
in,
we've
created
the
plain
error
rule
that
still
requires
a
proof
of
prejudice.
so
you're
asking
us
to
create
something
that's
really
sui
generis
in
saying
it's
always
a
structural
error.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assume
i
accept
that
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
--
you're
saying
this
is
a
structural
error
always.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
yablon,
i
agree
with
you
totally.
i'm
not
as
much
convinced
in
the
delay
in
pleading
because
defendants
often
think
about
it
and
i
can
imagine
a
hypothetical
where
the
lawyer
comes
in
and
says:
i
told
him
to
plead
guilty
and
he
said
to
me:
i
don't
want
to,
but
the
judge
told
me
to.
so
i
don't
think
the
time
limit
--
we
don't
know
if
that
happened.
but
what
did
happen
is
that
the
defendant
made
a
motion
to
withdraw
his
plea
and
he
directly
said:
"i
entered
the
plea
because
i
strategically
decided
that
the
government
would
eventually
have
to
come
forward
and
vacate
the
charges
against
me.
"
he
said
it
himself
with
no
pressure
by
a
lawyer,
because
he
was
making
the
motion.
how
do
you
get
past
that
statement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that
is
the
whole
point,
which
is
this
may
be
iac,
but
i
don't
know
how
--
how
you
prove
that
what
the
magistrate
judge
said
to
him
led
to
his
decision.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
only
if
we
don't
accept
that
prejudice
is
a
consideration
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
not
the
first
time
that
has
happened.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
disagree
with
how
the
fourth
and
seventh
circuits
and
other
circuits
apply
a
prejudice
analysis,
but
one
that
says
that
it's
highly
unlikely
that
you're
not
going
to
find
prejudice?
do
you
disagree
with
their
analysis
and
approach?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no.
