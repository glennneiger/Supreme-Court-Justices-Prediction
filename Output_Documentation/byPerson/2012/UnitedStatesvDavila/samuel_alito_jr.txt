justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
there's
a
case
where
the
--
the
defendant
would
not
have
pled
guilty
without
the
court
saying
something
inappropriate
about
it's
a
case
where
the
defendant
would
be
crazy
to
go
to
trial
because
the
trial
would
lead
to
a
much
more
severe
sentence.
would
there
be
prejudice
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
--
what
if
the
judge
sees
what
the
judge
thinks
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
under
our
decision
in
lafler
taking
place?
is
there
anything
that
can
be
done?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
are
arguing
for
a
narrower
interpretation
of
rule
11(c)(1)
than
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
say
something
about
mr.
feigin's
comments
regarding
what
a
judge
can
and
cannot
do
if
the
judge
thinks
that
he
or
she
sees
a
violation
of
lafler
and
frye
taking
place?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
judge
knows
as
a
result
of
pretrial
motions
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
is
very,
very
strong.
let's
say
there's
a
--
there's
been
a
motion
to
suppress
extremely
incriminating
evidence
and
the
motion
has
been
denied,
so
the
judge
knows
this
is
going
to
come
in.
and
the
judge
thinks
if
this
comes
in,
there's
virtually
very
little
chance
that
the
defendant
is
going
to
be
acquitted,
and
yet
the
defendant
--
and
the
judge
knows
that
a
plea
bargain
--
a
plea
offer
was
made
and
the
defendant
initially
was
going
to
take
it,
and
then
before
it
was
accepted,
it's
rejected.
is
there
anything
a
judge
can
do
in
that
situation?
just
sit
back
and,
you
know,
wait
for
the
case
to
be
--
to
be
reversed?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
just
puts
--
puts
the
judge
in
a
very
difficult
position.
it
could
--
can
the
judge
say,
you
--
do
you
realize
that
i
denied
your
motion
to
suppress
that
wiretap?
and
do
you
recognize
that
on
that
wiretap,
you
conceded
that
the
loss
in
this
case
is
$20
million,
and
do
you
know
that
under
the
sentencing
guidelines,
the
sentence
where
the
loss
is
$20
million
is
whatever
it
is,
ten
years
in
jail.
if
the
judge
says
all
of
that,
has
the
judge
violated
rule
11(c)(1)?
