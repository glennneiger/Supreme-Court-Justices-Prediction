justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
--
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
it's
plain
error
because
the
defendant
didn't
make
an
objection
in
the
lower
court.
but
the
defendant
doesn't
know
about
rule
11
and
doesn't
know
about
11(c)
that
says
a
judge
is
not
supposed
to
participate
in
plea
bargaining,
and
his
lawyer
doesn't
tell
him
the
judge
is
doing
something
wrong
because
his
lawyer
wants
him
to
plea.
so
he
lacks
the
information
necessary
to
make
a
prompt
objection.
so
it
seems
a
bit
unfair
to
say
that
he's
subjected
to
plain
error
when
he
hasn't
got
a
clue
that
the
judge,
magistrate
wasn't
supposed
to
do
what
he
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
a
lawyer
that
had
filed
an
anders
brief.
so
he
didn't
--
even
at
that
stage,
the
lawyer,
the
--
i
don't
want
to
absorb
your
time
beyond
this,
but
i
think
the
plain
error
is
questionable
when
it
seems
that
the
judge,
the
lawyer,
they
arranged
against
the
--
the
defendant,
and
the
defendant
doesn't
know
that
he
has
this
route.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
feigin,
is
there
any
situation
in
which
a
--
a
judge
participating
in
a
plea
bargaining,
any
situation
that
would
be
prejudicial,
that
you
recognize
would
be
prejudicial,
and
if
there
is
can
you
describe
what
that
would
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
makes
it
prejudicial
and
this
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
that
point,
do
we
know
--
do
we
know
if
the
district
judge
who
did
preside
at
the
plea
hearing
knew
about
the
episode
with
the
magistrate
3
months
earlier?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
same
for
the
prosecutor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
yablon,
the
--
the
case
that
you're
presenting
would
be
quite
strong
if
the
same
judge
--
if
the
magistrate
judge
also
presided
at
the
plea
hearing,
but
here
we
have
two
factors
that
are
special
in
this
case.
one
is
it's
a
different
judge,
and
two
is
we
have
the
interval
of
some
three
months
in
between.
and
then
we
have
a
plea
hearing
that
looks
to
me
like
it's
exemplary.
the
district
judge
did
go
through
everything
that
rule
11
calls
for.
so
it
is
a
different
case,
isn't
it,
when
we
have
a
plea
hearing
with
a
judge
who
is
exerting
no
pressure
at
all,
has
nothing
to
do
with
encouraging
the
defendant
to
plead,
but
there
was
an
earlier
episode
where
a
magistrate
judge
did
overbear?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
--
but
the
--
but
the
judge
did
ask,
do
you
recognize
that
your
--
your
conduct
satisfied
the
elements
of
the
conspiracy?
and
the
defendant
answered
yes.
and
the
--
the
judge
asked,
has
anyone
pressured
you
to
plead
guilty?
and
he
answers
no.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
yablon,
one
problem
with
calling
this
structural
error
is
that
it's
not
so
clear
that
this
is
a
--
a
bad
thing.
that
is,
some
states
even
today
allow
a
judge
to
participate
in
plea
bargaining,
and
the
advisors
--
the
rules
advisory
committee
--
said,
when
it
--
when
it
framed
this
rule
that
some
commentators
had
said
it
was
quite
--
quite
a
frequent
thing
that
happened,
that
judges
participated.
so
it
isn't
like
not
having
a
public
trial
or
not
giving
a
person
counsel
of
choice.
it's,
this
was
--
this
was
something
that
still
some
jurisdictions
think
it's
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
governs
guilty
pleas.
this
case
involves
two
parts
of
that
rule.
the
first,
rule
11(c)(1)
bars
judges
from
participating
in
plea
negotiations.
the
second,
rule
11(h)
states,
a
variance
from
the
requirements
of
rule
11
is
harmless
error
if
does
not
affect
the
defendant's
substantial
rights.
anthony
davila,
respondent
here,
was
indicted
on
multiple
federal
tax
fraud
charges.
early
on
he
wrote
to
the
u.s.
district
court
expressing
dissatisfaction
with
his
court
appointed
attorney
because
he
offered
no
defensive
strategy
but
simply
advised
davila
to
plead
guilty.
at
an
in
camera
hearing
with
only
davila
and
his
lawyer
present,
a
magistrate
judge
told
davila
he
would
not
get
another
court
appointed
attorney
and
said
davila's
best
course,
given
the
strength
of
the
government's
case,
was
to
plead
guilty.
over
three
months
later,
davila
pleaded
guilty
before
a
u.s.
district
court
judge.
under
oath
davila
affirmed
that
he
had
not
been
pressured
to
enter
the
plea.
the
plea
hearing
complied
in
all
respects
with
rule
11.
davila
said
nothing
to
the
district
judge
about
the
in
camera
hearing
before
the
magistrate
judge.
on
appeal,
the
eleventh
circuit,
unprompted
by
davila,
found
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
before
the
magistrate
judge
as
ordering
davila
to
plead
to
guilty,
all
agreed
violated
rule
11(c)(1).
following
circuit
precedent,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
violation
of
the
ban
on
judicial
participation
in
plea
bargaining
requires
automatic
vacatur
of
a
guilty
plea
whether
or
not
the
error
was
prejudicial.
we
granted
review
to
resolve
a
circuit
conflict
on
this
issue.
does
violation
of
rule
11(c)(1)
require
automatic
vacatur
of
a
guilty
plea
as
the
eleventh
circuit
held
or
as
the
government
urges
must
a
reviewing
court
consider
case
specific
facts
and
circumstances
to
assess
the
impact
of
the
error
on
the
defendant's
decision
to
plead
guilty?
we
hold
that
the
latter
inquiry
is
the
one
called
for
by
the
rule
and
our
decisions.
acknowledging
that
automatic
vacatur
is
inappropriate
for
most
rule
11
violations,
davila
argues
that
conduct
banned
by
rule
11(c)(1)
is
different.
he
distinguishes
plea-colloquy
omissions
from
pre-plea
exhortations
to
admit
guilt;
the
former
come
into
play
after
a
defendant
has
already
decided
to
plead
guilty,
the
latter,
before
a
defendant
has
made
that
choice.
improper
judicial
involvement
in
plea
discussions,
davila
maintains,
heightens
the
risk
that
a
defendant's
guilty
plea
would
be
the
result
of
coercion
and
not
a
genuine
exercise
of
freewill.
but
nothing
in
rule
11's
text
indicates
that
the
ban
on
judicial
involvement
in
plea
discussions
is
more
basic
than
other
rule
11
descriptions.
and
nothing
in
the
rule
or
its
history
suggest
that
the
ban,
if
dishonored,
requires
automatic
vacatur
without
regard
to
case
specific
circumstances.
of
overriding
importance,
the
rule
11(h)
specifically
designed
to
stop
automatic
vacaturs
falls
for
across
the
board
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule.
rule
11(c)(1)
was
adopted
as
prophylactic
measure
not
one
impelled
by
the
due
process
clause.
violation
of
the
rule
thus
does
not
belong
in
the
highly
exceptional
category
of
structural
errors
that
trigger
automatic
reversal
because
they
undermine
the
fairness
of
the
entire
criminal
proceeding.
instead,
in
assessing
rule
11
errors,
a
reviewing
court
generally
should
take
into
account
all
that
transpired
in
the
trial
court.
here,
that
includes
the
three-
month
interval
between
the
hearing
before
the
magistrate
judge
and
davila's
guilty
plea,
and
exemplary
plea-colloquy
conducted
by
a
district
judge
and
the
opportunity
davila
had
at
the
plea-colloquy
to
raise
any
questions
he
might
have
about
matters
relating
to
his
plea.
because
the
appellate
court
did
not
engage
in
a
full
record
assessment
of
the
particular
facts
of
davila's
case,
we
vacate
its
judgment.
we
decide
only
that
the
automatic
vacatur
rule
is
incompatible
with
rule
11(h)
and
leave
all
remaining
issues
to
be
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
joins.
