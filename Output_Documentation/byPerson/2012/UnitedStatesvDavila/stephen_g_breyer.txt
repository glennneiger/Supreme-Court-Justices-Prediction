but
that's
the
problem.
is
there
a
way
of
doing
this,
which
i
--
i
don't
see
at
the
moment?
but
the
judge
intervenes
in
a
serious
way
and
says,
you
go
listen
to
your
lawyer
and
this
is
a
very
harsh
penalty
and,
boy,
you
are
into
--
okay?
a
serious
problem.
and
now
to
track
down
whether
that
affected
substantial
rights,
you
have
to
try
to
track
down
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant
and
would
he
have
pled
guilty
anyway.
and
that's
sometimes
quite
difficult
to
do,
very
hard.
but
if
you
don't
insist
on
doing
it,
and
you
have
an
absolute
rule
of
structural
error
or
something,
then
you
suddenly
discover
these
minor
things.
the
judge
says,
go
to
lunch,
or
--
or,
you
know,
some
really
trivial
intervention,
and
you
are
going
to
say
that
--
the
guilty
plea,
he
can
just
void
his
guilty
plea.
so
there
should
be
a
way
of
distinguishing
the
trivial
from
the
--
from
the
really
important
in
terms
of
how
serious
the
intervention
was,
but
i
don't
see
any
way
to
do
that.
have
--
have
you
thought
about
that
at
all?
do
we
have
to
go
all
the
one
way
or
all
the
other
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
want
us
to
basically
not
apply
the
11(h),
the
harmless
error
business,
and
you
basically
want
to
prevent
bizarre
results
by
making
a
tough
definition
of
the
word
“
participate
”.
that's
how
i
understand
you.
and
maybe
you
are
right,
but
it
sounds
to
me
as
you
say
it
in
reading
the
briefs
that
this
is
really
a
job
for
the
rules
committee.
this
is
a
rule.
we
don't
normally
have
structural
errors
with
respect
to
rules.
we
have
rules
committees
there
to
listen
to
this
kind
of
complaint,
to
weigh
it
in
the
system
as
a
whole
and
to
come
up
with
better
rules.
