mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
sentence
of
section
7703(b)(2)
provides
that
district
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
all
mixed
cases,
and
that
provision
is
largely
dispositive
here.
the
second
section
of
7703(b)(2)
on
which
the
government
relies
is
a
statute
of
limitations,
and
it
doesn't
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts.
that
subsection
is
set
out
at
pages
16a
to
17a
of
the
government's
brief.
the
first
sentence
provides
that
for
a
described
category
of
cases,
they
are
to
be,
quote,
"filed
under
one
of
the
listed
federal
antidiscrimination
statutes.
"
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
elgin,
all
of
those
are
statutes
which
authorize
jurisdiction
in
claims
in
district
courts.
indeed,
in
title
vii
and
the
adea,
that
is
the
only
federal
court
which
is
authorized
to
hear
the
cases.
mr.
eric
schnapper
with
regard
to
the
--
when
the
case
gets
to
district
court,
there
may
be
two
substantive
claims,
a
discrimination
claim
and
a
csra
claim.
your
question,
i
take
it,
is
about
the
former.
our
view
is
that
the
claim
is
filed
and
pled,
as
indeed
it
was
pled
in
this
case,
as
a
discrimination
case;
in
this
case,
under
several
different
statutes.
and
the
complaint
here
reads
very
much
like
an
ordinary
discrimination
complaint.
the
government
may
raise
the
--
that
sort
of
procedural
issue
as
an
affirmative
defense,
and
it
would
be
free
to
do
so
here.
and
that
--
that
happens
on
a
number
of
occasions.
for
example,
if
there
were
a
case
in
which
the
plaintiff
had
not,
as
required
by
the
regulations,
appealed
to
the
mspb
within
30
days
of
the
--
of
receipt
of
the
agency
decision,
the
government
could
move
to
dismiss
that
claim
on
what
the
lower
courts
call
exhaustion
grounds.
and
the
lower
courts
have
repeatedly
sustained
those
motions--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--but
that's
a
determinative
defense.
mr.
eric
schnapper
when
it's
come
up,
your
honor,
it
has
generally
been
a
question
of
law,
like
whether
the
30-day
rule
had
applied.
if
you
had
something
that
was
--
if
it
were
a
factual
issue,
our
contention
is
then
those
section
7703(c)
factual
issues
have
to
be
decided
de
novo.
mr.
eric
schnapper
and
the
first
question
would
be
whether
it's
an
affirmative
defense
at
all,
and
our
position
would
be
that
it
is
not.
not
everything
that
could
go
awry
in
the
internal
procedure
is
an
affirmative
defense.
one
of
the
central
principles
of
the
1972
amendments
to
title
vii
was
to
create
an
exhaustion
regime
which
is
precise,
simple
and
short.
and
if--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--they're
there--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it's
--
yeah,
i
totally
understand
the
question.
mr.
eric
schnapper
they
--
they
are
different.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
--
the
discrimination
claim
is
dealt
with
de
novo.
the
intent
of
congress
was
that
it
would
generally
be
treated
like
a
private
discrimination
claim.
however,
the
csra
claim
is
dealt
with
under
the
same
standard
that
would
apply
in
the
federal
circuit.
and
that's--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well
established.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that's
what
the
lower
courts
have
been
doing.
and
we
don't
--
we
think
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i
doubt
it.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
your
honor.
i
was
talking
about
the
amendments
to
the
19
--
to
title
vii
in
1972.
mr.
eric
schnapper
prior
to
that,
courts
were
applying
the
judicially
fashioned
exhaustion
requirements.
and
the
--
congress
made
a
decision
to
replace
that.
as
this
court
noted
in
chandler
and
in
brown
v.
gsa,
congress
concluded,
i
think
correctly,
and
the
court's
opinion
suggests
that,
that
the
steps
necessary
to
exhaust
were
not
clear.
so
the
regime
established
by
section
717
of
title
vii,
which
was
adopted
in
1972,
sets
up
an
exhaustion
requirement
which
is
clear,
simple
and
limited
in
time.
it
requires
the
plaintiff
to
file
a
complaint,
wait
at
that
point
180
days,
and
at
that
point,
the
plaintiff
was
done
and
could
go
to
district
court.
plaintiff
also
had
the
option
at
that
point
of
going
to
the
civil
service
commission,
waiting
180
days.
but
as
long
as
a
timely
complaint
was
filed,
that
was
all
that
was
required
of
the
plaintiff.
and
that
was
a
fundamental
change
in
the
way
this
had
been
dealt
with.
the
adea
regime,
which
was
adopted
in
1974,
was
actually
even
simpler,
although
it's
been
changed
a
little
bit
since.
the
plaintiff
to
exhaust
had
to
do
only
one
of
two
things,
either
file
a
complaint
with
the
eeoc,
period,
or
give
the
eeoc
notice
that
the
plaintiff
was
going
to
sue
and
wait
30
days.
as
the
government
pointed
out
in
its
brief
in
stevens,
the
exhaustion
regime
under
the
adea
hadn't
--
didn't
in
any
way
address
what
happened
after
the
complaint
was
filed.
it
simply
said,
file
the
complaint.
that
is
the
fundamental
principle
that's
animated
the
title
vii
exhaustion
requirement
in
title
vii
and
the
adea,
and
we
don't
think
the
csra
was
written
to
change
that.
indeed,
to
the
contrary,
the
csra
has
--
it
doesn't
do
so
expressly
--
it
incorporates
by
reference
those
statutes;
it
expressly
reiterates
the
de
novo
exhaustion
requirement.
it
actually
shortened
the
period
of
time
that
plaintiff
has
to
wait
for
these
cases.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes,
your
honor.
plaintiff
can
do
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
your
honor.
the
affirmative
defenses
could
still
be
raised.
it's
just
that
the
csra
claim
under
section
7703(c)
would
be
abandoned.
and
that's--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that's
what
happened
here.
it's
not
uncommon.
the
csra
claim
involves
a
right
that
is
much
more
valuable
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
administrative
process.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
statute
says
“
cases
of
discrimination
subject
to
”--
mr.
eric
schnapper
"cases
of
discrimination
subject
to
7702.
"
and
7702--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no.
the
way
the
courts
have
read
this,
and
i
think
correctly,
is
this:
if
--
so
this
is
just
one
case.
it's
a
little
bit
like
supplemental
jurisdiction.
so
long
as
the
plaintiff
is
asserting
a
discrimination
claim,
the
csra
claim
comes
along
with
it.
if
the
plaintiff
were
to
abandon
the
discrimination
claim,
then
the
case
would
have
to
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
that's
the
way
the
courts
have
interpreted
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
the
second
point
you
make
is
really
separate
from
the
first,
because
even
if
only
a
discrimination
claim
is
filed,
the
government
can
insert
an
affirmative
defense,
and
one
possible
affirmative
defense
which
the
government
has
repeated
asserted
successfully
is
that
the
appeal
to
the
mspb
was
untimely.
so
that
happens
either
way.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
it's
because
--
because
the
discrimination
statutes
themselves
have
two
requirements.
you
have
to
have
filed
the
complaint
or
an
appeal,
depending
on
where
you
are
in
the
process.
you
have
to
wait
a
certain
amount
of
time
if
you
don't
have
a
decision.
the
statutes
themselves
don't--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--your
honor,
that
question,
of
course,
isn't
here
because
we
haven't
asserted
a
csra
claim.
and
if
you
have
doubts
about
it,
i
think
i
would
reserve
that
for
another
case.
but,
we
think
the
--
the
courts
have
treated
this
as
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
claims
of
discrimination
subject
to
7702.
it
says
“
cases
of
discrimination
”.
and
if
you
look
at
section
7702,
which
is
set
out
at
page
8a
of
the
government's
brief,
it
describes
the
cases
involved
as
cases
which
contain
these
two
elements.
they
are
treated
as
one
case
in
the
administrative
process.
and
it
would
be
highly
peculiar
for
the
government
--
for
the
statute
to
take
one
administrative
proceeding
and
then
split
it
in
half.
mr.
eric
schnapper
yes.
title
vii
and
all
the
statutes
authorize
that.
mr.
eric
schnapper
in
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--that's
exactly
right.
and
we
think
this
is
a
classic
example
for
application
of
the
rule
that
implied
repeals
are
disfavored.
this
statute
is
quite
precise
when
--
when
it's
changing
something,
it's
very
specific.
the
second
section,
section
7703(b)(2),
begins
with
the
words
“
notwithstanding
”,
because
it
is
changing
the
statute
of
limitations
that
would
otherwise
apply.
it's
changing
it
from
90
days
in
title
vii
to
30
days.
so
when
congress
wanted
to
change
something,
it
was
very
specific.
but
the
whole
thrust
of
this
statute
is
to
leave
in
place,
except
where
very
specifically
it
does
otherwise,
the
regime
that
existed
under
title
vii
in
the
adea.
mr.
eric
schnapper
not
--
that's
not
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
exhaustion
premises
in
the
statute,
but
these
statutes
do
not
contain
a
time
period
within
which
a
charge
or
a
complaint
must
be
filed
with
the
agency,
and
they
don't
contain
a
time
period
within
which
an
appeal
must
be
taken.
those
time
periods
are
in
the
regulations.
the
lower
courts
have
taken
the
position
that
those
time
periods
also
have
to
be
complied
with,
and
we
think
that's
correct.
in
the
case
of--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--and
there
are
also
time
periods
relevant
to
filing
a
complaint
at
the
agency
level.
it's
an
--
in
the
case
of
a
private
discrimination
claim,
that
time
period
is
specified
by
title
vii.
but
section
717
about
federal
employees
is
simply
silent.
congress
didn't
deal
with
it.
but
it
did
authorize
the
eeoc
and
the
mspb
to
write
regulations.
they
have
both
written
regulations
that
--
with
regard
to
the
agency,
it
is
the
eeoc
regulations
which
set
up
the
time
period
within
which
a
complaint
must
be
filed.
with
regard
to
appeals
to
the
mspb,
both
the
eeoc
and
the
mspb
have
regulations
which
are
the
same.
mr.
eric
schnapper
we
don't
--
we
think
not,
your
honor.
again,
this
doesn't
go
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
which
is
specified
in
the
statute.
the
statute
creates
a
regime.
it
doesn't
set
up
time
periods.
we
think
the
statute
should
be
read
to
--
to
mean
that
the
authority
of
the
government,
of
the
agencies
to
write
regulations,
includes
regulations
setting
up
time
periods.
it's
just
inconceivable
that--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--congress
contemplated
you
would
have
forever
to
do
these
things.
mr.
eric
schnapper
non-mixed
case.
yes.
there
are
regulations
governing
both.
the
non-mixed
case
claim
would
only
be
governed
by
the
eeoc
regulation.
the
mixed
case
claim
is
governed
as
well
by
the
time
limit
in
the
mspb
regulation,
but
that
is
the
same
as
the
time
limit
in
the
eeoc
regulation.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
your
honor,
the
--
you
have
led
a
charmed
life.
mr.
eric
schnapper
i'm
not
sure
how
that
affects
it.
the
phrase
mixed
case
is
in
the
regulations,
both
of
the
eeoc.
it
also
was
in
currency
prior
to
1978.
when
congress
was
working
on
this
problem,
it
was
already
calling
these
kinds
of
cases
mixed
cases.
and,
of
course,
we
haven't
touched
on
this.
a
mixed
case
is
a
case
which
involves
--
has
two
elements.
first,
it
involves
what's
called,
under
the
civil
service
reform
act,
an
appealable
issue.
that
is
an
issue
which
can
be
appealed
to
the
mspb,
not--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--you
could
not
take
that
case
to
the
federal
circuit
without
waiving
your
antidiscrimination
claim.
that
is
what
the
--
that's
the
way
we
read
the
law
and
that
is
the
way
the
mspb
reads
the
law.
the
mspb
regulation
expressly
provides
that
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
federal
circuit
you
must
waive
that
right.
mr.
eric
schnapper
well,
it's
our
view
that
once
you
appeal
to
the
mspb,
and
putting
aside
the
unusual
situation
of
people
who
withdraw
the
appeal,
you
then
must
wait,
under
the
statute,
120
days
or
until
you
have
a
decision.
so
you
are
ready,
all
set,
and
you
could
go
to
court
after
the
district
court
decision,
but
if
you
appeal
to
the
mspb,
you
then
have
to
wait
until
120
days
have
passed
or
you
have
a
decision.
mr.
eric
schnapper
what
you
gain
are
the
rights
in
section
7701(c)
which
are
set
out
on
page
3a
of
the
government's
brief.
in
the
appeal
to
the
mspb
with
regard
to
the
civil
--
the
csra
claim,
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
its
decision
was
correct.
if
you
bypass
the
mspb
and
go
to
district
court,
then
your
claim
is
only
a
claim
under
section
7703(c),
which
requires
the
plaintiff
to
establish
that
there
wasn't
even
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
decision.
so,
plaintiff--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--the
csra
claim
is
much
more
valuable
at
the
mspb.
in
terms
of
discrimination
claim,
in
the
real
world
that's
probably
not
why
people
go
to
the
mspb.
the
mspb,
according
to
the
only
study
i've
been
able
to
find,
out
of
2,000
mixed
cases
the
mspb
actually
only
found
discrimination
in
four.
but
a
much
higher
percentage
of
csra
claims
are
successful
there.
so
that's
why
people
go
there.
mr.
eric
schnapper
sure.
and
that's
why
people
go
there.
that's
why
people
go
there.
mr.
eric
schnapper
no,
no,
that
was
not
our
distinction.
that
was
the
distinction
that
i
think
in
the
tenth
circuit--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--yes.
our
view
is
that
all
mixed
cases
go
to
the
district
court.
that
is
the
view
of
the
mspb
and
of
the
eeoc
and
the
regulations--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it's
not
the
view
of
the
circuit
courts.
mr.
eric
schnapper
that
is
not
their
view
and
we
think--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--right.
we
think
that
that's
wrong
and--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--well,
you
don't--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
you
don't
need
to
address
it,
but
we
think
those
decisions
are
wrong.
the
statutory
arguments
that
we're
making
treat
--
draw
no
distinction
between
procedural
and
jurisdictional--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--it's
somewhat
stronger,
but
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
why
we
think
this
distinction
doesn't
make
sense.
the
first
one
is
if
jurisdictional
issues
went
to
the
federal
circuit
you
would
have
an
--
a
really
bizarre
problem
of
--
of
splitting
the
claim,
and
here's
why:
if,
under
the
eeoc
regulations
which
the
government
has
referred
to,
if
the
mspb
holds
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
in
a
mixed
case,
the
discrimination
claim
doesn't
die.
under
the
regulations
it
goes
back
to
the
agency
which
then
processes
it
as
a
non-mixed
case.
but
the
plaintiff
is
still
free
to
challenge
the
decision
of
the
mspb
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
in
the
government's
view,
that
would
go
to
the
federal
circuit.
so
the
case
would
then
be
pending
in
two
different
places.
and
if
the
plaintiff
came
to
the
end
of
the
line
in
the
--
at
the
agency
level
and
lost,
the
plaintiff
clearly
would
go
to
district
court.
on
our
view,
everything
goes
to
the
district
court.
mr.
eric
schnapper
you
can,
and
you
don't
need
to
address
what
i
just
said.
mr.
eric
schnapper
your
honor,
you
don't
need
to
rule
for
that
--
me
on
that,
but
if
i
could
identify
another
problem
before
my
time
runs
out.
there
is
--
and
it
comes
up
in
two
ways.
sometimes
whether
a
case
is
appealable
depends
on
whether
there
was
discrimination.
there
is
a
district
court
decision
in
barel
v.
louisiana
in
which
that
problem
arose.
i
will
spare
you--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--right.
but
that's
why
i
think
if
you
have
doubts
about
it,
you
should
stay
away
from
it
because
that's
very
bad.
in
addition,
in
a
constructive
discharge
case
based
on
sexual
harassment,
whether
there's
jurisdiction,
the
mspb
in
deciding
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
has
to
decide
whether
there
was
sexual
harassment.
it
seems
to
me
you
would
not
want
that
going
to
the
federal
circuit.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
schnapper
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
answer
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
yesterday
morning
in
lozman.
you--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--i
--
i
am
happy
to
do
so,
your
honor.
you
pointed
out
that
--
that
where
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
is
it
important
that
rules
be
clear?
and
you
asked
counsel
for
respondent,
why
was
respondent's
rule
clearer
than
the
petitioner's
rule?
in
this
case
our
rule
is
demonstrably
clearer.
the
question
is
which
mixed
cases
go
to
the
district
court?
our
answer
is
all.
the
government's
answer,
the
rule
that
is
derived
from
ballentine,
has
confounded
the
lower
courts
since
ballentine
and
those
problems
are
reflected
in
the
divergent
accounts
of
the
rule
in
the
government's
brief.
there
are
more
than
half
a
dozen
of
these
problems.
first,
the
courts
are
divided
below,
as
is
the
government's
brief,
about
whether
the
government's
rule
applies
to
all
procedural
issues
or
only
to
procedural
issues
that
arise
before
the
court
reaches
the
merits.
for
example,
in
--
in
hopkins
v.
mspb,
after
the
court
had
resolved
the
merits,
there
was
a
dispute
about
counsel
fees
and
an
argument
that
the
counsel
fee
application
was
untimely.
the
government
took
the
position
that
that
timeliness
issue
belonged
in
the
district
court.
secondly,
the
lower
courts
are
divided
as
is
the
government's
brief
about
whether
a
procedural
issue
that
is
related
to
or
intertwined
with
the
merits
goes
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
a
line
of
cases
holding
that
a
--
a
--
when
the
mspb
holds
there
is
no
jurisdiction
because
the
discrimination
claim
is
frivolous,
that's
a
procedural
jurisdiction
issue,
it's
not
a
merits
issue.
and
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
in
hill
v.
department
of
the
air
force,
you
see
a
lengthy
description
of
title
vii
law,
in
mcdonnell
douglas
v.
green,
in
the
course
of
a
decision
by
the
federal
circuit
holding
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
third,
it
is
unclear
what
constitutes
the
line
between
a
merits
decision
and
a
procedural
decision
issue.
some
things
are
really
neither.
for
example,
there
are
recurring
disputes
about
whether
a
settlement
was
voluntary.
well,
it's
not
the
merits
of
the
discrimination
case,
but
it's
not
procedural
in
any
normal
sense
of
the
word.
fourth,
there
are
cases
which
involve
several
claims
resolved
on
several
different
bases.
we
noted
some
of
them
in
our
reply
brief.
one
--
one
claim
was
rejected
on
jurisdictional
grounds;
one
claim
was
rejected
on
res
judicata
and
one
claim
was
decided
by
the
board
on
the
merits.
unclear
how
that
would
go.
there
are
also
situations
in
which
two
cases
get
filed,
one
of
which
--
and
they
are
related
cases,
and
they
go
to
the
same
judge,
and
one
--
one
involved
an
mspb
decision
on
procedural
grounds,
one
on
the
merits.
the
court
in
that
case
just
thought
it
ought
to
just
keep
them
both.
it's
not
clear
how
that
comes
out.
fourth
--
some,
sorry,
fifth.
mr.
eric
schnapper
sometimes
within
the
mspb
--
you
have
the
point.
i
don't
mean
to
belabor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
schnapper
oh,
that
was
--
i
didn't
mean--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--oh,
okay.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
--
i
think
we
are
at
six.
mr.
eric
schnapper
the
ms
--
the--
mr.
eric
schnapper
--okay.
the
--
an
mspb,
alj,
or
the
board
itself
could
resolve
a
claim
on
alternative
grounds,
as
judges
do
all
the
time,
and
say,
well,
we
think
this
is
time
barred,
but
we
also
find
that
it
lacks
the
merits.
i
know
where
that
goes.
there
is
also
a
problem,
which
the
briefs
address,
about
factual
disputes
that
arise
with
regard
to
jurisdiction
or
procedure.
the
--
7703(c)
says,
"questions
of
fact
get
decided
de
novo.
"
what
does
that
mean?
if
there
--
let's
take,
for
example,
a
case
in
which
the
claim
is
that
a
charge
wasn't
filed
on
time
with
the
agency.
that's
a
question
of
fact.
the
agency
might
find
that
it
was
timely
--
there
could
be
a
dispute
of
fact
about
when
the
violation
occurred
which
triggers
the
limitation
period.
the
agency
would
make
a
finding
of
fact.
the
mspb
might
affirm
that
finding.
the
government
tells
us
they
would
affirm
whatever
the
agency
did.
the
statute
seems
to
say
that's
got
to
be
decided
de
novo,
but
federal
circuit
can't
do
that.
thank
you.
