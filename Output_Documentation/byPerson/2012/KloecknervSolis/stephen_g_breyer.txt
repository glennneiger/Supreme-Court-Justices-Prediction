justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
read
it
that
way,
do
you?
i
mean,
look,
it
says
in
(a),
it
says,
let's
take
an
employee
who
is
affected
adversely,
and
then
it
says
"alleges
that
the
basis
for
the
action
was
discrimination.
"
okay.
in
that
case
the
board
shall
within
120
days
decide
both
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
the
appealable
action.
so
they
decided
it.
they
decided
it
was
out
of
time.
they
decided
it
was
barred.
they
decided
da,
da,
da.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
decisions
on
an
issue
that
a
person
raises
in
court
and
we
don't
normally
say
they
didn't
decide
the
issue,
the
court.
it
decided
it.
it
decided
it
was
untimely.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
i
see.
the
issue.
they
shall
decide
the
issue
of
discrimination.
i
mean,
you
can
read
it
as
saying
they
have
to
decide
the
merits
or
you
could
read
it
as
saying,
there
could
be
several
claims
that
went
on
below.
heard
them,
decide
the
discrimination
one.
now,
you
decide
the
discrimination
one.
and
i
agree
they
used
the
word
“
issue
”
instead
of
saying
decide
the
discrimination
claim,
that
it
says
here,
he
alleges.
they
could
have
said,
decide
the
allegation.
they
could
have
said,
decide
that
part
of
the
case.
but,
i
mean,
why
do
we
want
to
jump
over
14
hurdles
to
give
this
narrow
interpretation
to
that
word
issue
when
all
that's
going
to
happen
is
we'll
have
a
new
jurisprudence
arising.
is
the
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
allegation
of
discrimination,
that
it
wasn't
enough
to
really
make
out
discrimination?
it
was
partial
summary
judgment.
it
was
a
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
the
statement
in
the
complaint.
it
was
--
i
mean,
we
can
think
of
40
different
things,
perhaps,
that
are
going
to
be
hard
to
distinguish
as
to
whether
they're
procedural,
jurisdictional
or
on
the
merits.
and
why
do
we
want
to
get
courts
into
that,
when
the
simplest
thing
is
the
person
says,
i
allege
discrimination.
there
it
is
right
in
paragraph
1(b)
of
his
paper.
the
mspb
says,
you
lose
for
any
reason
on
that
particular
one,
and
now
we
go
to
the
district
court.
that's
just
so
simple.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no.
all
we're
doing
is
interpreting
what
you've
said
is
the
word
issue,
not
to
be
quite
so
technical
as
to
mean
decide
on
the
merits,
which
it
doesn't
mean
normally,
but
we're
interpreting
it
to
mean
decide
the
allegation
that
he
has
raised
that
he
was
discriminated
against.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
you
want
to
say
on
the
question
of
which
is
worse?
that
is
to
say,
i
get
your
point
on
the
word
“
issue
”,
and
i
think
you
can
read
the
word
“
issue
”
to
say
there
is
a
contested
point
as
to
whether
there
was
discrimination
or
to
say
there
is
a
contested
point
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
the
mspb
--
whether
the
plaintiff
has
a
--
has
a
legal
right
before
the
mspb
to
get
the
lower
--
the
agency
reversed
on
the
issue
of
discrimination.
the
latter
way
favors
your
opponent,
the
former
favors
you;
okay.
so
we
could
do
either,
i
guess.
the
one
way,
if
you
win,
there
will
be
a
body
of
law
about
what
counts
as
procedural
and
what
doesn't.
that
sounds
confusing
to
me.
if
you
lose,
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
there
will
then
be
different
courts
deciding
different
procedural
matters,
where
you'd
get
more
uniformity
out
of
the
federal
circuit.
okay.
do
you
have
anything
to
say
about
which
of
those
two
evils
is
worse?
is
there
any
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--have
we
any
way
of
knowing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--going
back
to
the
language,
and
so
far,
in
my
hypothetical
anyway,
i
think
the
language
at
best
might
be
read,
that
word
“
issue
”,
the
way
you
say,
but
need
not
be.
