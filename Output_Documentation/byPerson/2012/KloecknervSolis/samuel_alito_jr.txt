samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
you
tell
me
what--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
provision--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--what
provision
authorizes
the
filing
of
anything
other
than
a
discrimination
claim
in
district
court?
i
don't
see
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
“
cases
of
discrimination
”--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--yes.
it
says,
"shall
be
filed
under
title
vii.
"
so
you
are
saying
that
a
nondiscrimination
claim
can
be
filed
under
title
vii?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that
a
lot
of
courts
have
read
it
that
way.
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
how
it
fits
in
the
statutory
language.
and
in
particular,
since
the
second
sentence
of
subsection
(2)
there
has
its
own
filing
deadline,
it
seems
strange
to
have
a
district
court
review
the
timeliness
of
the
filing
before
the
mspb.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
you're
giving
this
up,
and
i
don't
see
--
i
also
don't
see
any
provision
that
says
that
--
that
specifies
what
the
standard
of
review
in
the
district
court
is
for
a
nondiscrimination
claim.
(c)
sets
out
the
standard
of
review
in
the
federal
circuit
for
a
nondiscrimination
claim,
but
it
pointedly
says
nothing
about
the
district
court.
doesn't
that
suggest
that
that
claim
doesn't
go
to
the
district
court?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can't
an
employee
take
a
mixed
case
appeal
to
the
federal
circuit?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
doesn't
the
language
that
justice
kagan
referred
to,
the
requirement
that
the
board
within
120
days
decide
both
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
the
appealable
action,
mean
that
the
board
has
to
dispose
of
both
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
the
appealable
action,
not
that
it
must
actually
adjudicate
those
two
issues?
what
if
you
have
a
threshold,
you
have
a
threshold
timeliness
issue
that
is
completely
dispositive?
you're
saying
that
this
language
means
the
board
nevertheless
has
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
discrimination
issue?
