justice
sonia
sotomayor
counselor,
can
i
back
you
up
a
minute
to
join
the
two
questions
that
my
colleague
posed
to
you?
let's
assume
there's
a
merits-based
decision
on
the
csra
and
one
on
the
discrimination.
in
the
normal
course,
assuming
you
are
not
barred
by
being
untimely,
you
could
go
to
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
presumably
would
have
jurisdiction,
if
one
is
a
discrimination-based
decision,
to
decide
both
questions.
what's
the
standard
of
review
that
a
court
would
apply
to
each
of
those
claims
independently
or
together?
i
mean--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--we
can
then
fight
about
whether
the
factual
issue
regarding
the
timeliness
and
exhaustion
should
be
subject
to
one
or
the
other
standard
of
review,
but
what
are
the
standards
of
review?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
argued
that
you
were
exceeding
the
dismissals
on
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
should
go
to
the
federal
circuit,
but
that
you
were
only
invoking
the
exception
that
procedural
dismissals
should
be
permitted
to
go
to
the
district
court
or
authorized
to
go.
are
you
still
standing
by
that
distinction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
but
when
you
argued
it
below
you
argued
the
exception,
you
didn't
argue
the
jurisdictional
rule.
are
you
abandoning
that
distinction?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it's
not
the
view
of
the
circuit
courts,
even
the
courts--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--even
the
courts
whose
exception
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--every
circuit
court
unanimously
holds
that
jurisdictional
rule
dismissals
should
go
only
to
the
federal
circuit.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--should
you
be
arguing
this
before
us?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
this
a
distinction
you
should
abandon
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
at
least
ask
us
not
to
address?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
actually
the
7512
argument
has
more
legs,
i
think.
the
point
is
that
you're
only
permitted
to
go
to
district
court
on
issues
of
discrimination
that
are
within
the
board's
jurisdiction.
so
if--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
you
abandoning
the
jurisdictional
procedural
distinction
as
you
did
in
your
brief?
are
you
telling
us
to
rule
either
completely
for
you
or
against
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
prepared
on
behalf
of
the
government
to
say
that
if
we
rule
that
procedural
dismissals
can
go
to
the
district
court,
then
you
--
then
the
government
will
concede
that
jurisdictional
dismissal
should
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
7512.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case,
but
your
brief
seemed
to
make
the
argument
that
there
was
no
basis
for
the
distinction
between
procedural
and
jurisdictional.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
ask
you
a
couple
questions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
when
the
federal
circuit
was
created,
this
language
preexisted
its
creation,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
could
you
tell
me
how
when
congress
was
writing
7702
it
was
creating
the
system
that
you
are
advocating
when
it
had
no
idea
that
it
would
ever
create
the
federal
circuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
still
doesn't
answer
my
question,
which
is:
assuming
there
is
no
federal
circuit,
i
have
to
read
the
language
that
exists
in
7702
and
7703,
and
i
see
judicial
review,
appealable
judicial
review,
used
not
in
the
manner
that
you're
describing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
have
a
quarrel
with
your
opposing
counsel's
position
that
once
the
board
decides
the
csra
claim
and
the
discrimination
claim,
the
district
court
reviews
both?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
justice
alito
was
questioning
that,
but
you
don't
quarrel
with
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
lack
of
uniformity
is
inherent
in
this
structure.
you
just
want
to
carve
out
one
piece
of
it
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
you
say
deserves
more
uniformity.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
a
problem,
because
to
accept
your
reading
is
to
say
that
judicially
reviewable
action
differs
between
770
--
differs
between
7702
and
the
escape
hatch,
because
the
only
way
the
escape
hatch
can
work,
it,
too,
cross-references
7702
in
the
same
way
that
the
provisions
you
are
relying
on
do.
under
your
reading
both
should
be
given
identical
meaning,
because
they
both
cross-reference
7702;
and
yet
your
brief
says,
no,
we
shouldn't
have
that
absurd
result.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
concede
that
there
is
an
absurd
result
in
applying
your
interpretation
to
the
escape
hatch,
by
definition,
your
meaning
can't
be
ascribable
to
that
phrase.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
the
board--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
when
does
the
time
frames
of
the
escape
hatch
commence--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
the
board
hasn't
rendered
any
decision
on
anything?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
still
have
an
exhaustion
argument
to
raise
if
we
were
to
send
this
to
the
district
court?
