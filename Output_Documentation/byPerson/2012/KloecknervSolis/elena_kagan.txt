justice
elena
kagan
could
i
make
sure
i
understand
something
that
you
said,
mr.
schnapper.
when
you
talk
about
the
affirmative
defenses
that
the
government
can
raise,
those
are
exhaustion
defenses
under
the
applicable
anti-discrimination
statute,
right?
it's
whatever
exhaustion
requirements
title
vii
sets
out
or
whatever
exhaustion
requirements
the
adea
sets
out;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
those
time
periods
relevant
to
the
mspb?
justice
elena
kagan
and
would
that--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
would
that
put
the
employee
who
has
a
mixed
case
in
the
same
position
as
an
employee
who
has
a
straight
anti-discrimination
case?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry
--
go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
schnapper,
if
i
disagree
with
everything
that
you
just
said,
i
can
still
rule
for
you
in
this
case,
right?
justice
elena
kagan
because
there
does
seem
to
be
a
good
deal
of
difference
between
the
question,
what
happens
to
something
that
is
clearly
a
mixed
case,
and
alternatively,
the
question
of
whether
something
is
a
mixed
case;
that
is,
whether
it
includes
a
claim
about
an
action
which
the
employee
may
appeal
to
the
mspb.
and
one
could
think
that
questions
about
what
can
be
appealed
to
the
mspb
ought
to
go
to
the
federal
circuit
under
this
statutory
language
in
a
way
that
questions
that
are
involved
in
this
case
do
not.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
just
makes
the
next
case
very
complicated
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
ms.
harrington,
go
back
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
you,
because
the
question
was:
should
we
read
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
as
something
different
from
action
subject
to
judicial
review,
which
is
how
you
would
normally
read
that
language,
as
something
different
from
just
final
agency
action
that
you
can
take
to
a
court.
not
saying
which
court,
that
you
can
just
take
to
a
court.
and
you're
asking
us
--
you
said
it's
a
term
of
art.
so
i
guess
the
next
question
is:
how
do
you
get
the
definition
of
the
term
of
art
that
you
say
exists
in
this
statute?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
it
has
to
be
an
action
that
--
you
know,
the
mspb
is
done
and
now
you
have
a
certain
number
of
days
to
take
it
to
a
court.
so
that's
the
normal
way
you
would
read
that
language.
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
say
no,
it
really,
you
know,
it
includes
some
kinds
of
decisions
and
not
other
kinds
of
decisions
and
the
effect
of
that
is
that
it's
really
a
switch
as
to
which
court
you
get
to
take
the
action
to,
which
is
a
very
counterintuitive
way
to
read
this
language.
so
i
guess
i'm
asking
you:
where
do
you
find
the
definition
of
the
term
of
art?
and
i
think
what
your
answer
is
going
to
be
is
this
notion
the
board
shall
decide
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
the
applicable
action;
is
that
correct.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
harrington,
would
you
agree
that
this
is
a
remarkably
strange
way
of
congress
trying
to
accomplish
this
objective?
i
mean,
if
congress
were
really
saying
we
don't
want
procedural
determinations
to
go
to
the
district
court,
that's
a
very
easy
thing
to
say.
congress
does
not
need
to
send
you
--
you
know,
involve
six
different
cross
--
references
and
unnatural
reading
of
statutory
language.
and,
you
know,
in
the
end,
your
argument
just
is
based
on
this
notion
that
congress
used
the
word
decide
rather
than
dispose
of
in
this
single
provision.
the
argument
would
completely
collapse
if
that
were
not
the
case.
it
just
seems
like
if
congress
wanted
what
you
say
it
wanted,
congress
would
not
have
done
it
in
this
extremely
complicated
and
backhanded
way.
justice
elena
kagan
but
you're
not
--
the
federal
circuit
didn't
exist
at
the
time
that
these
statutes
were
written,
so
what
--
you
know,
really,
it
would
have
been
taken
to
the
various
courts
of
appeals,
and
you
wouldn't
have
gotten
that
uniformity
anyway.
justice
elena
kagan
right,
but
justice
sotomayor
is
right,
that
when
you
define
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
in
your
way,
then
7702(e)(1)(b)
becomes
nonsensical
and
you
have
to
save
it
by
inserting
additional
language,
by
saying,
you
know,
“
and
other
”
--
“
and
other
kinds
of
action
”.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
wouldn't
make
sense,
but
it's
what
the
language
would
command
if
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
means
what
you
say
“
judicially
reviewable
means
”.
justice
elena
kagan
under
the
civil
service
reform
act,
which
i'll
call
the
csra
for
short,
a
federal
employee
who
was
fired,
demoted
or
subjected
to
another
serious
personal
action
can
challenge
that
action
before
an
administrative
body
called
the
merit
systems
protection
board
which
i
sometimes
just
the
board
for
short.
if
the
employee
thinks
the
personnel
action
was
not
only
unjustified
but
also
based
on
illegal
discrimination,
such
as
race
discrimination
or
sex
discrimination,
then
the
employee
has
what
federal
regulations
call
a
mixed
case.
the
case
is
called
mixed
because
it
involves
both
a
serious
personnel
action
against
the
federal
employee
and
a
claim
of
discrimination.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
carolyn
kloeckner
has
such
a
mixed
case.
she
was
fired
by
the
department
of
labor
and
claims
that
her
firing
was
discriminatory,
so
she
initially
brought
her
case
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board,
but
the
board
found
that
she
had
not
complied
with
its
filing
deadlines
and
dismissed
the
case.
an
employee
like
ms.
kloeckner,
whose
mixed
case
is
rejected
by
the
board
is
entitled
to
judicial
review,
review
by
a
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
where
ms.
kloeckner
should
go
to
seek
that
review.
that
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
what
does
the
csra
say
about
which
court
ms.
kloeckner
should
file
suit
in.
ms.
kloeckner
says
that
under
the
csra,
she
should
file
a
discrimination
suit
against
the
government
in
federal
district
court
and
that
is
in
fact
what
she
did.
but
the
government
says
that
would
be
true
only
if
the
board
had
ruled
against
her
on
the
merits
of
her
discrimination
claim,
because
the
board,
instead,
dismissed
her
case
on
procedural
grounds.
the
government
contends
ms.
kloeckner
should
instead
file
a
petition
in
the
federal
circuit
which
is
a
specialized
appellate
court.
the
courts
below
agreed
with
the
government
and
accordingly
dismiss
the
suit
ms.
kloeckner
filed
in
district
court.
today,
we
reverse
that
decision.
we
hold
that
when
the
board
rules
against
the
federal
employee
who
claims
that
a
serious
personnel
action
violates
an
anti-discrimination
statute,
the
employee
should
seek
judicial
review
by
filing
suit
in
district
court
under
the
applicable
anti-discrimination
law.
that
is
true
irrespective
of
whether
the
board's
decision
was
on
the
merits
or
on
procedural
grounds.
our
decision
is
based
on
two
sections
of
the
csra.
we
look
first
to
section
7703.
that
section
provides
that
federal
employees
should
generally
seek
judicial
review
of
board
decisions
in
the
federal
circuit,
but
it
also
includes
an
important
exception
for
what
it
describes
as
cases
of
discrimination
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
7702.
those
cases,
section
7703
tell
us,
should
be
filed
in
district
court.
we
next
look
to
section
7702,
the
cross-referenced
section,
which
tells
us
that
cases
of
discrimination
subject
to
its
provisions
are
what
i've
been
calling
mixed
cases,
cases
like
ms.
kloeckner's
in
which
a
federal
employee
charges
that
a
serious
personnel
action
was
discriminatory.
so,
when
we
put
sections
7703
and
7702
together,
we
find
a
straightforward
instruction.
mixed
cases
like
ms.
kloeckner's
should
be
filed
in
district
court
and
not
in
the
federal
circuit.
the
government's
argument
to
the
contrary,
it's
claimed
that
the
csra
sends
the
board's
merits
decisions
to
district
court
while
sending
it's
procedural
rulings
to
the
federal
circuit.
well,
it's
very
complicated.
it's
so
complicated
that
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
explain
it
to
you
this
morning.
more
to
the
point,
it's
too
complicated
to
be
right.
the
csra
provides
a
simple
answer
to
the
question
before
us
and
we
today
acknowledge
that
clear
congressional
command
in
rejecting
the
government's
argument
and
telling
ms.
kloeckner
that
she
was
correct
to
file
her
discrimination
suit
in
district
court.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
