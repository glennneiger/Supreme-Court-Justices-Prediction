justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper,
could
you
clarify
what
the
district
court,
as
you
see
it,
does?
does
it
deal
only
with
the
discrimination
claim,
or
does
it
deal
with
the
mspb's
procedural
ruling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
don't
we
take
this
--
this
very
case,
where
the
mspb
said
that
--
that
the
claim
was
time
barred,
so
the
government
would
raise
it
as
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
--
you're
talking
about
the
discrimination
claim.
in
your
view,
could
the
plaintiffs
now
in
the
district
court
say,
i'll
forget
the
csra
remedy;
district
court,
you
have
authority
to
hear
the
title
vii
case,
the
adea
case,
and
that's
all
i
need?
and
so
i'm
not
--
i'm
abandoning
my
csra.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
that
would
take
care
of
the
whole
thing
you
discussed
before
about
the
affirmative
defense
and
the
government.
it
would
be
the
plaintiff's
choice,
i
want
my
title
vii
case
and
that's
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper,
can
you
explain
something
about
the
mspb's
role?
that
is,
once
you
have
a
final
decision
from
the
agency,
you
could
go
right
to
court.
you
don't
--
on
the
discrimination
claim,
right?
you
don't
need
to
go
to
the
mspb.
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
anything
before
the
mspb
to
get
your
discrimination
claim.
so,
how
does
the
m
--
the
possibility
of
going
to
the
mspb
make
the
discrimination
claim
any
less
ripe
for
judicial
review
than
it
would
be
if
you
stopped
at
the
agency
level?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
--
what
are
your
advantages?
you
are
deciding
--
you
have
the
final
agency
decision,
you
could
go
right
to
court
on
the
discrimination
claim.
what
do
you
gain
by
invoking
the
mspb
authority?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
harrington,
may
i
just
clarify
that
if
--
if
the
case
goes
to
the
mspb,
and
the
ms
--
the
federal
circuit,
the
federal
circuit
agrees
with
the
mspb
that
this
was
untimely
filed,
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
the
discrimination
claims
would
never
be
heard
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the
plaintiff
then
goes
to
the
district
court,
then
what
position
does
the
government
take?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schnapper
told
us
in
his
brief,
and
he
repeated
it
this
morning,
that
the
mspb
and
the
eeoc
disagree
with
your
reading
of
the
statute,
that
they
think
that
the
so-called
mixed
case
goes
to
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
didn't
--
in
the
ballentine
case,
didn't
the
mspb
take
the
position
that
it
didn't
go
to
the
federal
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
you
--
are
you
--
are
you
telling
us
that
the
position
you're
representing
on
behalf
of
the
government
is
the
position
that
the
mspb
would
take
today,
is
the
position
that
the
eeoc
would
take
today?
