chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-184,
kloeckner
v.
solis.
mr.
schnapper.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
schnapper--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
critical
point,
i
gather,
is
what
standard
of
review
the
district
court
will
apply
to
that
exhaustion
question,
or
the
bottom
question,
right?
i
assume
you
think
that
the
standard
review
in
the
district
court
is
going
to
be
more
favorable
to
your
client
than
the
standard
--
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
that
would
be
applicable
in
the
federal
circuit?
i
guess--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
if
you
give
up
your
csra
claim,
they
can
assert
that
defense?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
suppose
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
i
suppose
if
you
say,
i
was
fired
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
the
agency
says,
no,
you
were
fired
because
you
were
incompetent,
you
could
take
the
incompetence
claim
to
the
mspb,
and
if
you
win,
saying,
no,
you
were
perfectly
competent,
they
shouldn't
have
fired
you,
you
get
that
relief
and
you
don't
need
to
proceed
with
the
discrimination--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
harrington.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
does
that
mean
that
it
is
not
a
judicially
reviewable
action
if
it
is
thrown
out
on
a
procedural
ground.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
is
that?
i
mean,
we
think
of
a
--
we
review
cases
on
procedural
objections
all
the
time
and
we
think
of
those
as
judicially
reviewable.
it's
--
it's
a
real
stretch
to
say
simply
because
it
says
“
judicially
reviewable
”
it
means
judicially
reviewable
on
the
merits.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
could
you
say
that
again?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
little
more
slowly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
it's
subject
to
judicial
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
the
next--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--okay.
so
i
thought
that
your
argument
in
the
brief
reduced
to
the
question
that
an
action
subject
to
judicial
review
in
one
section
is
not
judicially
reviewable
in
another.
that's
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
more
slowly.
[laughter]
i
thought
--
i
thought
i
heard
you
to
say,
and
this
is
what
i
understood
your
brief
to
say,
that
an
action
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review
is
not
judicially
reviewable
under
7703(b)(2).
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
tough
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
getting
back
to
judicially
reviewable--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
if
i
accept
your
argument
that
that's
not
the
same
as
subject
to
judicial
review,
isn't
it
an
odd
backhanded
way
to
get
to
your
position?
this
is
not
something
about
--
a
provision
about
what's
judicially
reviewable
and
what's
not.
it's
a
notice
provision.
it
says
these
actions
have
to
be
filed
within
30
days
after
notice
of
judicial
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
then
you
say
that
judicial
reviewability
is
the
key
linchpin
that
bases
your
argument,
when
it's
really
just
in
a
sentence
about
notice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yes,
that's
where
the
phrase
comes
in,
but
it
does
seem
an
odd
way
to
establish
that
that
is
the
critical
element
that
tells
you
which
provisions
you
can
take
forward
when
it
just
says
your
time
is
30
days
after
you
get
notice
of
judicial
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
here
the
government
says,
aha,
judicial
review,
we
think
that
does
not
mean
subject
to
judicial
review.
judicially
reviewable
doesn't
mean
subject
to
judicial
review.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
of.
see,
it
shall
be
reviewable
action
as
of.
again,
it's
just
going
to
the
timeliness.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
harrington.
mr.
schnapper
you
have
4
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
better
remind
me.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
fifth.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
i
--
i
just--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
are
on
number
five.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
no.
11-184
kloeckner
versus
solis.
