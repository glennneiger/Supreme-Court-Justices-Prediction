justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
finish
your
prior
answer?
you
--
you
started
to
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
started
to
say
that
the
civil
service
reform
act
made
some
fundamental
change?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
--
suppose
the
civil
service
reform
act
had
said
nothing
at
all
about
suits
under
the
civil
rights
act,
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
and
so
forth.
what
would
the
situation
be?
wouldn't
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
to
prevent
you
from
going
to
district
court
under
those
statutes,
you
have
to
find
a
repealer
contained
somewhere--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
civil
service
reform
act,
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
that
a
repealer
of
what
would
otherwise
be
the
law
under
all
these
civil
rights
statutes?
why
isn't
that
a
repealer
of
what
would
otherwise
be
their
right
to
go
to
district
court?
you
are
saying,
no,
you
can't
go
to
district
court
because
of
these
time
limits,
not
even
established
by
statute,
but,
for
pete's
sake,
established
by
regulation.
you
think
that
that's
--
that's
an
effective
repealer
of
the
right
to
go
to
district
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
just
keeping
score.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
checking
them
off.
