i've
probably
led
a
charmed
life,
but
i've
never
heard
of
mixed
case
until
this
matter
came
before
us.
and
i
was
--
i
suppose
you
have
to
adopt
the
phrase,
but
the
statute
7703
just
say
“
cases
”,
“
cases
of
discrimination
”,
which
is
what
this
is.
we
don't
usually
think
of
cases
that
we
call
a
discrimination
case
based
on
whether
or
not
it
contains
other
issues.
it's
a
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
i
think
that
helps
you.
