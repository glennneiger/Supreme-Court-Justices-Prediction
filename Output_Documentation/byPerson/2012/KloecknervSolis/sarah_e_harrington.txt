ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
if
i
could
with
justice
scalia's
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
always
been
our
position,
justice
sotomayor.
our
position
has
consistently
been
that
the
only
decisions
of
the
mspb
that
can
get
review
in
a
district
court
are
decisions
on
the
issue
of
discrimination.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
your
honor.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
again,
we
don't
think
any
of
them
should
and--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
agree
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
distinction
and
part
of
that
is
because,
as
my
friend
mr.
schnapper
pointed
out,
there
is
an
eeoc
regulation
providing
that
when
the
board
dismisses
a
case
on
jurisdictional
grounds
the
case
can
go
back
to
the
agency,
the
agency
can
essentially
reissue
its
final
decision,
and
then
the
plaintiff
goes
in
to
district
court.
so
if
the
whole
point
is
to
find
a
way
for
an
employee
to
get
into
district
court
on
her
discrimination
claim,
we've
already
had
that
taken
care
of
in
jurisdictional
dismissal
cases.
so
the
action
really
here
is
with
procedural
dismissals.
and
i
would
like
to
start
with
justice
scalia's
line
of
questions
about
whether
there
has
been
a
repeal
of
the
right
to
go
to
district
court
on
discrimination
claims.
and
i
think
our
starting
point
is
in
the
federal
courts
improvement
act
which
is
28
usc
1295(a)(9)
which
provides
that
review
of
mspb
decisions
is
exclusively
in
the
federal
circuit.
this
court
most
recently
in
elgin
but
in
various
cases
over
of
the
last
25
years
has
seen
that
that
is
an
exclusive
grant
of
judicial
review
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
circuit
over
mspb
final
decisions,
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
elgin
the
only
exception
to
that
is
for
the
subset
of
final
board
decisions
that
are
covered
in
7703(b)(2).
and
if
you
look
at
7703(b)(2)
the
only
reference
to
a
final
board
decision
is
at
the
top
of
page
17a
of
the
government's
brief
is
to
judicially
reviewable
actions
under
section
7702.
now
we
put
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
the
phrase
judicially
reviewable
action
and
the
reason
we
do
that
is
because
throughout
the
entire
u.s.
code
that
phrase
is
only
ever
used
either
in
or
in
reference
to
section
7702.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
means
that
it's
not
a
judicially
reviewable
action
under
7702.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
in
our
view,
again,
because
it
uses
the
phrase
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
under
7702
and
that
phrase
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
in
the
whole
u.s.
code
is
only
ever
used
when
you
are
talking
about
7702,
that
--
in
our
view
that's
the
signal
that
that's
a
term
of
art
in
this
context.
so
although
dismissal
on
procedural
grounds
is
a
board
action
subject
to
judicial
review,
in
our
view
it's
not
a
judicially
reviewable
action
under
7702.
and
so
you
need
to
look
at
7702
to
see
how--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
a
procedural
dismissal
by
the
board
is
a
final
board
action
that's
subject
to
judicial
review
in
the
federal
circuit.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
it
does
not
fall
within
the
term
of
art
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
under
7702.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
say
it
again?
i'm
sorry?
[laughter]
this
is
going
to
happen
a
lot.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
right.
it
does
not
fall
within--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--the
exception
to
exclusive--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--review.
it's
a
tough
statute.
in
our
view,
our
argument
is
the
best
reading
of
the
overall
statute.
and
again,
because
we
think
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
under
7702
is
sort
of
the
linchpin
phrase
in
7703(b)(2),
we
want
to
look
to
7702
to
how
the
phrase
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
is
used
by
congress
in
that
statute,
and
the
relevant
pages
here
are
page
8a
and
9a
in
the
statutory
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
i
have
two
answers.
the
first
is
that
in
the
last
25
years
in
all
the
cases
where
this
court
has
looked
as
section
7703,
in
lindahl
and
fausto
and
most
recently
in
elgin,
the
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
as
it
exists
today,
which
as
it
exists
today
directs
review
of
board
decisions
to
the
federal
circuit.
but
the
second
answer
is,
even
for
that
brief
window
after
the
csra
was
enacted
before
the
federal
circuit
was
created,
congress
still
had
taken
away
jurisdiction
from
district
courts
over
board
decisions
and
had
directed
them
to
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
this
court
recognized
in
fausto
that
that
--
congress
specifically
had
that
intent
when
it
enacted
the
csra.
it
was
tired
of
this
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
all
the
district
courts
throughout
the
country
over
federal
employment
actions
and
it
wanted
to
reduce
a
layer
of
review
and
direct
them
to
fewer
courts.
now--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
disagree,
your
honor.
and
there
is
nothing
in
7702
or
7703
that
would
indicate
that
congress
wanted,
even
in
1978
to
have
mspb
final
decisions
reviewed
in
district
court.
and
again,
we
don't
need
to
assume
that
the
federal
circuit
doesn't
exist
today
because
it
does,
and
that's
how
this
court
has
construed
the
statute
for
the
last
25
years,
ever
since
the--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
you
look
at
7702,
and
let
me
just
say,
even
if
you
disagree
with
us
that
it's
a
term
of
art,
it's
hard
to
disagree
with
the
fact
that
it
has
to
be
a
judicially
reviewable
action
under
7702.
that's
in
the
text
of
7703(b)(2).
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--yes.
can
i
just
take
you
back
one
sentence
and
say,
the
point
is
not
just
that
the
board
is
done,
the
point
is
that
the
board
is
done
under
7702;
that
it
has
issued
a
decision
under
7702,
and
so
then,
as
you
suggest,
we
look
at
7702
and
in
that
provision
congress
specifies
various
points
at
which
a
final
board
decision
under
7702
becomes
a
judicially
reviewable
action.
the
one
that's
relevant
in
this
case
is
in
subsection
(a)(3),
which
is
on
page
9a
in
the
middle
of
the
page
there.
it
says:
"any
decision
of
the
board
under
paragraph
(1).
"
--so
that's
7702(a)(1)
--
"of
this
subsection
shall
be
a
judicially
reviewable
action,
either
when
it's
issued
if
the
employee
doesn't
seek
eeoc
review
or
when
the
eeoc
declines
to
hear
the
case.
"
so
in
our
view
there
are
two
indications
in
(a)(3)
that
tell
you
that
it
has
to
be
a
decision
on
the
issue
of
discrimination
in
order
to
be
a
judicially
reviewable
action
--
action
under
section
7702.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no.
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question.
the
directive
in
section
--
that
you're
referring
to
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
8a.
the
directive
is
that
the
board
shall
decide
both
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
the
appealable
action
in
accordance
with
the
board's
appellate
procedures.
in
this
case
the
board
complied
with
that
directive
by
not
deciding
the
issue
of
discrimination
because
the
appeal
was
untimely.
and
i
know
that
sounds
a
little
strange
when
i
first
say
it,
so
let
me
give
you
an
analogous
example.
imagine
a
state
law
that
directed
the
dmv
to
issue
a
driver's
license
to
any
applicant
in
accordance
--
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
governing
such
applications.
if
the
dmv
required
that
driver's
license
applicants
either
pay
a
fee
or
submit
to
an
eye
exam,
you
wouldn't
expect
that
they
would
have
to
issue
a
license
to
someone
who
refused
to
comply
with
those
requirements.
in
that
case
the
dmv
would
comply
with
the
directive
that
it
issue
a
license
in
accordance
with
its
procedures
by
not
issuing
a
license
at
all.
and
it's
the
same
thing
here.
here
the
board
complied
with
the
directive
that
it
decide
the
issue
of
discrimination
in
accordance
with
its
appellate
procedures
by
not
deciding
the
issue
of
discrimination
and
therefore
not
issuing
a
decision
under
7703.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
i
think
normally
when
a
court
dismisses
a
case
based
on
timeliness
you
don't
think
of
it
as
deciding
the
issue.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that
would
certainly
be
simpler.
and
if
it
were
up
to
us
to
make
up
the
rules,
maybe
that's
what
we
would
decide.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
figure
out
how
much
of
an
exception
congress
wanted
to
create
to
the
exclusive
--
to
the
federal
circuit's
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
mspb
decisions.
in
our
view,
its
choice
of
the
word
issue
is
important,
because
it's
not
just
deciding
the
case
that
alleges
discrimination.
it's
the
issue
of
discrimination.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
there's
another
hint
in
paragraph
(a)(3),
and
let
me
know
if
you
want
to
jump
in,
but
not
just
the
direction
to
look
at
(a)(1),
but
paragraph
(a)(3),
another
hint
that
congress
was
really
talking
about
cases
where
the
board
decides
the
issue
of
discrimination.
in
paragraph
(a)(3),
again,
on
(9)(a),
congress
provides
that
a
judicially
reviewable
action
becomes
--
becomes
a
judicially
reviewable
action
when
the
employee
decides
not
to
seek
review
from
the
eeoc
or
when
the
eeoc
decides
not
to
take
the
case.
now,
the
only
types
of
decisions
from
the
board
that
the
eeoc
can
review
are
decisions
that
reach
an
issue
of
discrimination.
and
so
it
would
be
strange
to
be
talking
about
decisions
under
(a)(1)
that
the
eeoc
could
review
if
you're
talking
about
decisions
that
don't
involve
the
issue
of
discrimination.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
mean,
the
plaintiffs
could
then
file
a
suit
in
district
court
and
seek
equitable
tolling
for
having
missed
the
deadline
to
file
from
the
date
of
the
final
agency
decision.
and,
in
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
alternative
bases
for
jurisdiction
that
was
asserted
in
the
district
court
below
in
this
case.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
depends
on
the
case.
in
this
case,
we
argued
against
equitable
tolling
because,
in
our
view,
she
had
missed
the
deadlines
through
her
own
fault.
but
if
there
was
some
reason
to
think
that
it
wasn't
really
her
fault
for
missing
the
deadlines
for
appealing
and
--
so
that
even
though
her
appeal
to
the
mspb
was,
in
fact,
untimely,
it
wasn't
really
her
fault,
then
we
might
not
resist
equitable
tolling.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
i
didn't
hear
him
say
that;
but,
if
he
said
that,
i
don't
think
--
i
mean,
i
know
it's
not
correct
that
the
eeoc
and
mspb
disagree
with--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--that
was
our
position,
you
know,
i
think
it
was
30
years
ago
now.
and
since
the
ballentine
decision,
the
government
has
had
the
other
--
has
had
the
position
that
we're
asserting
today,
which
is
that
the
only--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--yes.
yes.
our
brief
is
filed
on
behalf
of
all
the
agencies
in
the
united
states
that
are
affected
by
this.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
but
some--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
it's
in
a
provision
that's
describing
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
that's
set
out
in
7703.
so
the
general
rule
in
7703
is
that
when
you're
talking
about
final
board
decisions,
judicial
review
of
those
decisions
is
in
the
federal
circuit.
and
this
is
at
16(a)
and
17(a)
in
the
government's
brief.
it
says,
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
(b)(2).
so
when
you're
looking
to
(b)(2),
you're
asking
what
subset
of
final
board
actions
--
that's
--
final
order
or
decision
--
that's
their
language
used
in
(a)(1)
--
what
subset
of
final
orders
or
decisions
of
the
merit
systems
protection
board
fall
within
(b)(2).
now,
in
(b)(2),
the
only
types
of
final
orders
that
are
described
there
is
at
the
end
of
the
section,
judicially
reviewable
action
under
section
7702.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
under--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--so
even
if
you
throw
out
the
term
of
art--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--per
our
argument,
and
all
you
look
at
is
the
last
two
words
of
that
sentence,
which
is
section
7702,
you
still
have
to
look
at
7702
and
figure
out
when
congress
told
you
that
a
final
board
decision
could
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
and
the
relevant
place
for
this
case
where
it
did
that
is
in
section
(a)(3),
which
is
on
page
9a.
and
there
again,
it
points
at
(a)(1),
which
directs
that
the
board
decide
the
issue
of
discrimination.
so
it
says
a
decision
under
(a)(1)
is
--
is
judicially
reviewable.
if
a
decision
does
not
reach
the
issue
of
discrimination,
it
is
not--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--right.
but
again
--
but
the
two
time
triggers
would
only
come
into
play
if
a
decision
reached
an
issue
of
discrimination,
because
the
eeoc
can't
review
issues
--
can't
review
dismissals
on
jurisdictional
or
procedural
grounds.
it
can
only
--
the
eeoc's
review
of
the
board's
--
of
a
board
decision
is
limited
to
its
review
of
the
board's
interpretation
of
an
antidiscrimination
law
or
its
application
of
those
laws
to
a
particular
case.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
mean,
i'm
not
going
to
resist
the
idea
that
the
csra
is
very
complicated.
i
mean,
every
case
this
court
has
had
about
the
csra,
they
have
remarked
about
how
it
is
a
complex
statutory
scheme.
but
i
think
congress
did
accomplish
in
a
pretty
simple
way
what
you
suggest,
which
is
directing
that
procedural
rules
should
be
reviewed
in
the
federal
circuit,
and
it
did
that
by
making
that
the
background
rule.
in
7703(a)
and
(b)(1),
it
says,
final
decisions
of
the
board
are
reviewed
in
the
federal
circuit,
full
stop
only,
except
as
provided
in
(b)(2).
and
then
the
question
is,
well,
which
of
those
decisions
fall
within
(b)(2).
in
our
view,
you
should
not
read
that
exception
more
broadly
than
necessary
to
accommodate
employees'
rights
to
have
their
discrimination
claims
determined
de
novo
in
district
court.
here,
the
board
decision,
it
decided
two
things.
first,
was
petitioner's
appeal
to
the
board
timely;
and,
second,
was
there
good
cause
to
excuse
her
untimeliness.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
would
have
wanted
that
board
decision
to
be
reviewed
anywhere
other
than
the
federal
circuit.
the
whole
point
of
having
the
federal
circuit
is
to
have
a
unified
body
of
law
governing
certain
things
in
the
country
that
congress
really
thought
should
be
directed
to
one
place,
and
that
included
board
decisions.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
right,
but
you
would
have
had
more
uniformity
than
you
would
have
had
if
the
cases
had
continued
to
go
to
the
district
court,
which
is
what
--
which
is
what
was
happening
before
the
csra,
and
congress
specifically
wanted
to
stop
that
process.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
we
don't
quarrel
with
it.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it
is
true
that
a
small
range
of
procedural
issues
governing
the
board's
procedures
might
be
heard
in
district
court,
but
it
is
truly
a
very
small
universe
of
issues
bordering
on
non-existent,
and
let
me
explain
why.
as
suggested
here,
the
only
reason
--
the
only
way
it
would
come
up
is
as
part
of
an
affirmative
defense
by
the
agency,
a
defense
of
exhaustion.
but
then
generally
speaking
it
would
have
to
be
a
procedural
issue
that
the
government,
that
the
agency
raised
before
the
board
and
the
board
rejected.
now,
the
board's
own
regulations
allow
the
board
to
waive
any
of
its
--
any
of
its
regulatory
requirements,
including
timeliness,
for
good
cause.
and
so
the
government
would
have
to
argue
in
the
district
court
that
essentially
the
board
abused
its
discretion
by
not
waiving
a
procedural
objection,
and
that's
a
very
high
hurdle
and
i
think
it's
really
hard
to
imagine
very
many
cases
in
which
that's
going
to
come
up,
where
the
government's
going
to
make
that
kind
of
argument.
so
although
there's
--
there's
potential,
there's
a
potential
for
a
tiny
bit
of
erosion
of
uniformity
under
our
view,
it
is
really
a
small
universe
of
issues
that
could
go
to--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--absolutely.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
mean,
i
think
congress
made
the
determination.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
i
think
you
can
resolve
the
ambiguity
in
the
use
of
the
word
“
issue
”
by
looking
at
the
rest
of
(a)(3),
which
again
ties
the
decision
under
(a)(1)
to
reviewability
by
the
eeoc.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
that
the
eeoc
can
only
review
board
decisions
that
involve
an
issue
of
discrimination,
either
an
interpretation
of
an
antidiscrimination
law
or
an
application
of
such
a
law
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
not
because--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
so
just
to
be
clear,
we
think
the
phrase
“
judicially
reviewable
action
”
should
be
given
the
same
meaning
in
section
(e)
that
it
is
given
elsewhere
in
7702.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
our
view
is--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--so--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--exactly.
if
the
--
if
the
appeal
is
still
pending
before
the
board,
that's
when
the
escape
hatch
of
(e)
comes
in,
because
it's
just
intended
to
prevent
employees
from
being
held
hostage
by
board
inaction.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
it
only
becomes
nonsensical
if
you
think
it
should
apply
to
cases
that
are
no
longer
pending
before
the
board
under
section
7702.
in
our
view,
once
the
board
issued
a
decision
--
the
decision
in
this
case,
it
issued
a
decision
under
section
7701
which
is
the
general
provision
governing
board
decisions,
and
then
the
case
was
no
longer
pending
under
section
7702.
and
so
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
apply
the
escape
hatch
to
cases
in
that
situation.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
is
true
that
our
commonsense
gloss
on
the
statute
is
not
found
in
the
text
of
the
statute.
but
i
think
once
the
--
once
the
cases
has
been
decided
under
section
7701
on
procedural
grounds,
it's
no
longer
a
7702
case
before
the
board.
and
so
there
is
just
no
reason
to
think
that
subsection
(e)
would
apply
in
the
--
in
that
situation.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
we
raised
an
exhaustion
argument
as
an
alternative
ground
before
the
district
court.
the
district
court
construed
this
case
as
seeking
review
of
the
board's
decision,
not
seeking
review
of
the
agency's
decision.
petitioner
did
not
challenge
that
district
court
holding
before
the
circuit
in
her
opening
brief.
she
didn't
flag
that
as
issue
in
the
cert
petition
papers,
and
so
i
think,
although
now
she's
suggested
in
the
merits
briefing
that
this
case
--
this
court
maybe
should
really
just
decide
whether
she's
seeking
review
of
the
agency
decision
instead
of
the
board
decision,
in
our
view
that's
not
really
a
question
that
is
presented
in
--
in
the
case
any
longer.
in
our
view
she
is
seeking
review
over
the
board
decision,
the
board
decision
decided
that
her
appeal
was
untimely,
that
there
wasn't
good
cause
to
excuse
the
untimeliness.
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
statute
that
congress
would
have
wanted
that
kind
of
board
decision
to
be
reviewed
anywhere
other
than
the
federal
circuit.
and
so
in
our
view
it
does
not
fall
within
--
in
the
exception
to
exclusive
federal
circuit
jurisdiction
provided
in
(b)(2)
because
it
does
not
decide
the
issue
of
discrimination.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
