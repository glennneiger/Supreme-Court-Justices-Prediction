justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
think
they
disagreed
about
what
he
may
do;
i
thought
they
disagreed
about
what
he
must
do.
that
is,
the
florida
supreme
court
said
you
must,
da,
da,
da,
da,
da,
and
gave
a
whole
list.
i
thought
that's
what
the
case
was
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
a
totally
different
matter.
of
course,
i
agree
with
you
that
a
trial
judge
has
control
of
the
trial.
he's
likely
to
know
what's
relevant.
in
different
circumstances,
different
matters
will
be,
and
he
has
first
say
on
what
you're
going
to
go
into.
it's
the
must.
and
now
you're
on
the
point.
why
is
that
the
right
list?
i
mean,
what
in
the
constitution
requires
that
list?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
doesn't
the
supreme
court
believes
the
constitution
requires
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what--
