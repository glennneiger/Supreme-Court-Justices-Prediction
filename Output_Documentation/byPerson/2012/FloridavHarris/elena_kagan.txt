justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
garre,
could
i
understand
your
argument?
because
--
suppose
in
a
case
the
government
comes
in,
says
this
dog
has
been
through
training
and
the
handler
has
been
through
training.
and
this
is
a
case
in
which
--
this
is
never
going
to
come
up
when
the
dog
actually
alerts
to
narcotics;
it's
not
worth
anybody's
time
at
that
point.
it's
only
going
to
come
up
in
a
case
like
this,
where
a
dog
alerts
to
narcotics,
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
narcotics,
but
something
else
is
found,
and
so
the
person
ends
up
being
criminally
prosecuted.
so
it's,
you
know,
a
small
universe
of
cases.
so
the
government
comes
in
and
says
that
the
dog
has
been
trained.
can
--
can
the
criminal
defendant
at
that
point
call
the
handler,
say,
how
has
the
dog
been
trained,
what
are
the
methods
that
--
that
the
dog
has
--
was
used,
and
how
did
the
dog
do
in
training?
can
the
--
can
the
defendant
do
that.
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
can
ask
questions
like
how
did
the
dog
do
in
training.
justice
elena
kagan
and
how
about
if
you
really,
if
there
were
some
articles
that
said,
you
know,
that
there
was
a
certain
kind
of
method
that,
for
example,
led
to
a
lot
of
subconscious
cueing
by
the
handler.
could
the
--
could
the
criminal
defendant
say,
did
you
use
that
method
that
leads
to
these
problematic
results?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
using
“
cueing
”
not
in
terms
of
any
intentionality,
but
one
thing
that
i
learned
in
reading
all
of
this
was
that
one
difficulty
here
is
that
dogs
respond
to
subconscious
cues
and
that
there
are
different
ways
of
training
that
make
that
less
or
more
of
a
problem.
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
just
meant
to
say
that
there
were
--
there
were
no
drugs
found.
justice
elena
kagan
if
you
take
out
the
florida
supreme
court
and
this
one
trial
court
in
massachusetts,
basically
you
think
what
courts
have
been
doing
is
the
right
thing?
justice
elena
kagan
but
where
at
the
same
time
they'll
allow
a
defendant
to
question
the
handler
about
that
training,
about
how
the
dog
has
performed
in
that
training;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
in
this
case,
a
drug
detection
dog
alerted
at
a
truck,
signaling
the
drugs
were
inside.
the
question
we
consider
is
how
a
court
should
determine
whether
that
kind
of
alert
provides
a
police
officer
with
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle.
our
opinion
first
discusses
the
wrong
approach
and
then
describes
the
right
one.
officer
william
wheetley
pulled
over
a
truck
with
an
expired
license
plate
while
on
patrol
with
aldo.
a
dog
trained
to
detect
certain
narcotics.
after
the
driver,
clayton
harris,
refuse
to
consent
to
a
search.
wheetley
had
aldo
sniffed
the
drug's
exterior
the
truck's
exterior.
in
a
way,
this
court
has
previously
approved.
aldo
alerted
at
the
driver
side
door.
on
that
basis,
wheetley
decided
he
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
truck.
and
in
that
search,
he
found
illegal
ingredients
for
making
methamphetamine.
harris
challenged
the
search
is
legality,
arguing
that
aldo's
alert
did
not
give
wheetley
the
probable
cause
to
search.
the
florida
supreme
court
agreed.
at
first,
he
said
that
a
dog's
alert
provides
probably
cause
only
if
the
dog
is
a
reliable
detector
of
narcotics.
and
then
it
held
that
to
show
the
dog
is
reliable,
the
state
must
produce
extensive
documentary
evidence
on
a
variety
of
matters
including
statistics
about
how
the
dog
has
performed
in
the
field.
how
many
times
the
dog's
alerts
have
lead
to
the
discovery
of
drugs
and
how
many
times
they
have
not.
because
wheetley
didn't
have
those
records,
the
court
held,
he
didn't
have
a
sufficient
basis
to
search
harris's
truck.
today,
we
reverse
that
decision.
we
agree
that
a
dog
must
be
reliable
for
its
alert
to
provide
probable
cause
for
a
search,
but
we
disagree
with
the
florida
supreme
court
about
how
to
establish
the
dog's
reliability.
in
evaluating,
whether
police
have
probable
cause,
we
have
rejected
rigid
rules
in
favor
of
a
flexible
inquiry
into
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
florida
supreme
court's
approach
was
wrong
first
and
foremost
because
it
required
the
states
to
tick
off
every
item
in
a
lengthy
evidentiary
checklist
in
order
to
show
probably
cause.
that's
inconsistent
with
our
instructions
to
balance
all
the
evidence
relevant
to
reliability
in
a
more
holistic
way.
making
matters
worse,
the
court
treated
records
of
a
dog's
field
performance
as
the
gold
standard
in
evidence.
when
in
most
cases,
those
records
have
relatively
limited
import.
that's
because
a
dog
might
have
been
right
to
alert
even
if
no
drugs
are
found.
maybe
the
drugs
were
too
well-hidden
or
maybe
they
would
just
recently
remove
and
the
dog
responded
to
a
lingering
odor.
for
reasons
like
that,
the
better
way
to
asses
a
dog's
reliability
is
through
the
controlled
testing
that
is
a
standard
part
of
training
and
certification
programs.
the
florida
court
put
too
much
weight
on
the
dog's
field
performance
and
too
little
on
its
certification
and
training.
we
make
clear
today
that
a
court
should
evaluate
a
dog's
reliability
in
the
same
way
it
assesses
probable
cause
and
other
contexts.
by
the
telling
the
state
to
put
on
its
best
case,
allowing
the
defendant
to
rebut
it,
and
then
weighing
all
the
evidence
presented.
if
the
state
has
offered
evidence
that
a
dog
performs
reliably
in
finding
drugs
in
controlled
testing
environments
and
the
defendant
has
not
contested
that
showing,
then
the
court
should
fine
probable
cause.
if
the
defendant
has
challenged
the
state's
case
by
contending,
for
example,
that
the
dog
was
inadequately
trained
or
that
the
officer
improperly
cued
the
animal,
then
the
court
should
balance
that
evidence
against
the
states.
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
all
the
facts
surrounding
a
dog's
alert
viewed
through
the
lens
of
common
sense
would
make
a
reasonably
prudent
person
to
think
that
a
search
would
reveal
evidence
of
a
crime.
here,
that
test
was
satisfied.
the
state
offered
ample
evidence
of
aldo's
training
and
his
superior
performance
in
controlled
testing.
harris
did
not
contest
that
evidence
and
offered
no
other
valid
reason
to
think
that
aldo
was
not
a
reliable
detector
of
drugs.
accordingly,
the
florida
supreme
court
should
have
found
probable
cause.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
