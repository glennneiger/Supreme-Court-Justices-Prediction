what
is
wrong
with
the
state's
argument
that
field
performance
records
are
not
very
probative
because
dogs
detect
odors,
they
don't
detect
the
physical
presence
of
the
substance
that
created
the
odor,
and
therefore
so-called
false
alerts,
cases
in
which
a
search
was
performed
and
no
contraband
was
found
are
not
really
cases
of
false
alerts.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
may
all
be
true,
but
then
what
--
what
can
one
infer
from
the
fact
that
a
dog
alerted
a
number
of
times
when
no
contraband
was
found?
i
think
what
you
just
said
was
the
explanation
could
be
the
dog
detected
an
odor,
but
the
substance
wasn't
there,
or
it
could
be
that
the
dog
was
cued
or
the
dog
was
confused
or
the
dog
is
not
very
competent.
so
what
can
one
infer
from
these
field
performance
records?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
excuse
me.
where
--
when
nothing
is
found,
how
can
you
tell
whether
the
dog
alerted
to
a
residual
odor
or
simply
made
a
mistake?
now,
there
may
be
cases
where
there
is
other
evidence
that
suggests
that
drugs
were
present
in
that
location,
and,
therefore,
that
is
something
from
which
you
can
infer
that
the
dog
was
alerting
to
residual
odor;
but,
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
evidence
of
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
wasn't
residual
odor.
justice
samuel

was
that
the
holding
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
because
the
dog
alerted
to
the
wrong
part
of
the
truck?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
was
it
any
part
of
their
reasoning?
