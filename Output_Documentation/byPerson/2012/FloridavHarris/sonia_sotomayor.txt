justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
garre--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
thought
all
of
these
training
facilities
were
private
entities
that
contracted
with
police
departments.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question?
there's
no
--
what
i
hear
--
read
the
florida
court
saying
is
there's
no
national
standard
for
certification.
that's
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there's
no
national
standard
that
defines
what's
adequate
training,
correct.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
let
me
just
finish
my
question.
so
assuming
there's
no
national
standards,
then
how
do
you
expect
a
judge,
without
asking
questions
about
the
content
of
the
certification
process,
the
content
of
the
training
process,
and
what
the
results
were
and
how
they
were
measured,
how
do
you
expect
a
judge
to
decide
whether
the
certification
and
the
training
are
sufficiently
adequate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
still
have
to
ask
what
that
training
was,
and
the
judge
still
has
to
determine
whether
the
judge
believes
it
was
adequate,
correct?
that's
what
the
totality
of
circumstances
requires.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
does
a
judge
do,
just
say,
the
police
department
says
this
is
adequate,
so
i
have
to
accept
it's
adequate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
garre,
i
--
i
have
no
problem
that
this
record
--
with
this
record.
my
problem
is
how
do
we
rule.
because
it
seems
the
me
that
i'm
not
quite
understanding
what
--
how
--
the
legal
rule
you're
asking
us
to
announce.
i
think
the
legal
rule,
you're
saying,
if
the
dog
has
been
tested
for
proficiency
by
a
police
department's
determination
of
what's
adequate
for
proficiency,
that
establishes
probable
cause.
that's
what
i
think
the
rule
you
want
us
to
--
to
do.
i
don't
know
what
the
role
of
the
judge
is
in
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--with
that
rule.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no
certification,
no
questioning
of
the
handler
and
the
handler's
training?
the
judge
can't
do
any
of
that
and
shouldn't
do
any
of
that,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
not
enough
for
you
to
win
by
us
saying
that
a
court
can't
insist
on
performance
in
the
field
records,
that
it
has
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
what
other
case
have
--
have
we
announced,
under
a
totality
of
the
circumstance
test,
a
absolute
flat
rule
like
the
one
you're
proposing?
where
else
have
we
said
that
one
thing
alone
establishes
probable
cause--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
one
factor
alone.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
somewhat
troubled
by
all
of
the
studies
that
have
been
presented
to
the
court,
particularly
the
australian
one
where,
under
a
controlled
setting,
one
dog
alerted
correctly
only
12
percent
of
the
time.
how
and
when
and
who
determines
when
a
dog's
reliability
in
alerting
has
reached
a
critical
failure
number?
and
what
is
--
what
do
you
suggest
that
number
is,
and
how
does
a
judge
determine
that
that's
being
monitored?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i'm
deeply
troubled
by
a
dog
that
alerts
only
12
percent
of
the
time.
that
whatever
--
whether
we
have
a
fixed
number
or
an
unfixed
number,
that
seems
like
less
than
probability
for
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
doesn't
answer
what
happens
to
the
dogs
who
have
--
dogs
grow
old.
they
are
taken
out
of
service
for
a
reason.
so
how
--
how
is
a
court
supposed
to
monitor
whether
or
not
a
dog
has
fallen
out
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
have
two
separate
questions
for
you.
tying
the
earlier
case
a
little
bit
to
this
one,
i
am
assuming
that
your
position
is
--
and
you'll
tell
me
what
the
legal
standard
is
--
that
a
well-trained
dog,
if
he
alerts,
or
walks
by
a
row
of
apartments,
a
row
of
houses,
and
alerts
the
drugs,
that
that
simple
alert
is
probable
cause
for
the
police
to
get
a
search
warrant.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that,
without
any
other
information
about
--
unlike
the
earlier
case
or
this
one,
where
the
police
officer
saw
the
individual
being
nervous,
et
cetera,
et
cetera
--
that
all
--
all
it
takes
is
a
dog
alert,
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
no
study
that
says
the
dogs
reliably
alert
100
percent
of
the
time?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
--
i
understand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
so
shouldn't
we
be
addressing
the
question
whether
a
--
an
alert,
especially
outside
a
home
in
particular,
should
be,
standing
by
itself,
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
only
because
the
officer
said
that
he
satisfactorily
performed--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
what
the
florida
court
said:
but
we
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
understood
the
florida
supreme
court,
counselor,
to
say
that
the
deficit
in
the
training
records
here
was
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
false
positives,
that
the
reports
didn't
say,
the
training
reports
didn't
say,
if
the
dog
was
alerting
falsely.
assume
that
the
record,
as
your
adversary
claimed,
shows
the
opposite,
that
a
satisfactory
completion
means
that
the
dog
detected
drugs
where
they
were.
what
--
why
wouldn't
the
training
records
here
be
adequate
in
that
circumstance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
guess
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
as
a
matter
of
law
you
want
us
to
hold
that
training
records
are
inadequate
unless
what?
unless
--
you're
going
to
specify
now
a
list
of
things
they
have
to
include?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
how
is
that
any
different
than
a
police
officer
who
comes
to
a
car
and
smells
marijuana?
he's
never
going
to
know
whether
there
is
any
more
in
the
car
or
not.
it
could
have
been
smoked
up
an
hour
before.
i
don't
know
how
long
marijuana
lingers
for,
but
--
i'm
not
sure
why
residual
odor
affects
the
reliability
of
the
dog,
which
was
justice
scalia's
point.
it's
no
different
than
an
officer
who
smells
something.
he
doesn't
actually
know
whether
it's
physically
still
present
or
not,
but
we're
talking
about
probabilities.
