chief

john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
garre,
welcome
back.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
palmore.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
agree
that
that's
an
appropriate
area
of
inquiry?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
judge,
presented
with,
here's
aldo,
he
was
--
went
to
this
school,
he
was
certified,
the
judge
can
say,
when
was
he
last
tested,
right?
when
did
he
last
go
through
some--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
--
the
only
thing
really
you
say
they
can't
ask
about
is
what's
--
what's
his
record.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
i'm
not
sure
it's
relevant,
but
do
dogs
--
does
their
ability
--
is
it
even
across
the
board?
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
dog
that's
trained
and
good
at
sniffing
out
heroin,
the
same
dog
is
going
to
be
good
at
detecting
a
bomb,
or
is
there
some
difference?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
don't
know
whether
--
in
other
words,
are
dogs
good
at
sniffing
things,
or
are
they
--
can
they
be
good
at
bombs,
but
not
good
at
meth?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
gifford.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
getting
back
to
--
i'm
confused
about
the
difference
between
must
and
is
required.
what
if
the
judge
has
before
him
or
her
a
record,
this
is
where
the
dog
went
to
school
and
it's
a
bona
fide
school,
this
is
where
the
dog
was
certified,
he's
trained
every
--
every,
you
know,
couple
of
weeks
or
whatever
it
is,
and
the
judge
says,
do
you
have
any
field
records,
and
the
officer
says,
no,
and
the
drug
says
--
the
judge
says,
well,
then
no
probable
cause.
that's
reversible
error,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have,
i
guess,
experts
testify
about
whether
--
what
constitutes
a
good
training
program.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what's
the
magic
number?
what
percentage
of
accurate
alerts
or
inaccurate
is
enough
for
probable
cause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
garre,
you
have
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-817,
florida
against
harris.
