that
--
that
goes
to
the
field
performance;
but,
the
other
requirements,
that
the
--
some
showing
--
the
test
--
that
the
training
program
is
reputable,
some
showing
that
the
handler,
not
only
the
dog,
that
is
--
has
had
training,
it
seems
to
me
those
two
are
not
--
there's
nothing
improper
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
did
--
then
why
didn't
they
get
the
dog
recertified?
by
the
time
of
the
search,
the
certification
had
expired
16
months.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
have
to
show
to
establish
that
the
dog
was
well
trained.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
it
were
just
that
--
you
have
the
show
that
the
program
was
reputable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
garre,
you
said
there
was
the
certification,
training
program,
but
you
gave
a
third.
you
said,
or
otherwise
show
proficiency
in
locating
narcotics.
so
if
there
is
no
certification,
no
training,
how
would
the
state
establish
that
the
dog
was
reliable
in
detecting
drugs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
think
you'll
agree
that
the
handler,
too,
the
handler
would
have
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
--
not
certification,
but
that
the
handler
has
been
--
has
been
trained--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
work
with
drug
detection
dogs.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
palmore,
you
criticize
the
florida
supreme
court
for
requiring
evidence
of
field
performance;
and,
assuming
that
that
evidence
is
not
required,
if
the
defendant,
in
preparing
for
the
suppression
motion,
wants
what
information
there
is,
would
it
be
proper
to
seek
--
for
the
defendant
--
would
it
be
permissible
for
the
defendant
to
speak
--
to
seek
through
discovery
whatever
field
performance
records
there
are?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
the
state
doesn't
keep
--
if
the
state
doesn't
keep
any
performance
records,
then
there
would
be
no
field
performance
to
show,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
state
loses;
is
that
what
you're
saying?
the
state
doesn't
keep
performance
records.
the
florida
supreme
court
seems
to
say
field
performance
records
are
required.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
conceding
that
the
florida
supreme
court,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
field
performance
records,
was
wrong,
that
they
--
it
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
outline
what
the
government
must
prove,
and
that
was
one
of
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
this
--
this
officer
has
been
working
with
this
dog
for
many
months.
they
have
training
periods
every
week.
so
why
isn't
that
enough
to
show
that
this
handler
and
this
dog
worked
effectively
as
a
team?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
not
what
the
florida
supreme
court
said?
it
listed,
along
with
training,
that
the
--
the
provision
of
records
of
field
performance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it's
--
it's
a
dog
that's
just
completed
the
training,
training
course,
top-performing
dog
in
the
training
program,
but
there's
no
field
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
alert
--
the
alert
here
could
have
been
to
residual
odor,
or
it
could
have
been
to
drugs
inside
the
pickup
truck.
if
it's
--
because
the
alert
was
in
front
of
the
--
a
front
door
handle,
is
that
--
so
it
--
it's
equally
likely
that
it
--
that
it
was
just
residual
odor
or
that
there
were
drugs
inside
the
pickup
truck.
can
the
police
establish
probable
cause
when
what
the
dog
alerted
to
may
well
have
been
residual
odor
and
nothing
inside?
the
dog
didn't
alert
anyplace
other
than
the
door
handle,
is
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
if
we
think
they
were
wrong
in
that
respect,
i
suppose
that
you
would
say
the
court
shouldn't
reverse,
but
should
vacate
and
remand
because
the
question
did
alert
him
to
the
door
handle,
was
that
enough?
was
that
enough
to
establish
probable
cause
that
there
were
drugs
in
the
vehicle?
