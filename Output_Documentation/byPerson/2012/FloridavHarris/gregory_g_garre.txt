mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
your
honor,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
when
does
a
trained
drug
detection
dog's
alert
to
a
vehicle
establish
probable
cause
to
search
the
vehicle.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
for
it
again,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
the
florida
supreme
court
answered
that
question
by
erecting
what
we
think
is
an
extraordinary
set
of
evidentiary
requirements
that,
in
effect,
puts
the
dog
on
trial
in
any
suppression
hearing
in
which
defendant
chooses
to
challenge
the
reliability
of
the
dog.
i
think,
most
fundamentally,
the
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals'
--
the
supreme
court's
decision
--
is
that
it
misconceives
what
this
court's
cases
conceive
of
the
probable
cause
requirement,
converting
probable
cause,
which
this
court
has
referred
to
as
a
substantial
chance
or
fair
probability
of
the
detection
of
contraband
or
evidence
of
a
crime,
into
what
amounts
to
a
continuously
updated
batting
average
and
a
requirement
that
dogs
be
virtually
infallible.
that
--
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
under
our
view
of
it,
it's
okay
to
inquire
into
whether
or
not
the
dog
has
successfully
completed
a
bona
fide
training
program,
which
--
which
we
think
is
a
training
program
in
which
the
dog
is
going
to
be
tested
for
proficiency,
including
in
a
setting
where
some
vehicles
have
drugs
and
some
vehicles
don't.
and
aldo,
the
dog
in
this
case,
clearly
was.
he'd
received
a
120-hour
training
program
with
the
police
department
in
apopka,
florida.
he
received
a
40-hour
refresher
seminar
by
another
police
department
in
dothan,
alabama.
and
he
was
subjected
to
continuous
weekly
training,
in
which
part
of
that
training
consisted
of
taking
him
out,
walking
him
by
some
vehicles
that
contained
cars,
some
vehicles
that
didn't.
and
the
testimony
of
officer
wheetley
was
that
aldo's
performance
was
really
good.
and
what
he
meant
by
that
was
that
if
there
were
eight
cars
with
drugs.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
it
was
a
lapse,
your
honor.
the
dog
subsequently
was
recertified.
our
position
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
impose
an
annual
certification
requirement.
some
states
have
it,
some
states
don't.
i
think,
more
important
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
the
dog
was
continuously
trained,
continuously
evaluated
and
trained.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
most
important
thing
is
successful
completion
of
proficiency
testing.
i
mean,
what
--
what
our
friends
would
like,
and
what
the
florida
supreme
court
would
like,
was
really
for
the
courts
to
delve
into
all
aspects
of
the
training,
what
types
of
distracters
were
used,
what
type
of
smell
and
printing
was
used
and
the
like.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
certainly
that
it
was
authentic,
your
honor.
and
here,
the
programs
were
conducted
by
actual
police
departments
in
--
in
alabama
and
florida.
and
this
court
ordinarily
would
presume
regularity
in
those
sorts
of
training
settings.
and
there's
no
reason
to
approach
the
training
of
a
dog
any
differently,
but--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--no,
your
honor.
the
certification.
certification
usually
is
done
by
private
entities
which
are
operated
by
former
law
enforcement
officers.
but
the
training
itself,
it
usually
and
here
was
done
by
police
departments
themselves.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
right.
there--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--and
i
think
that
the
central
inquiry
that
we
would
think
the
judge
would
undertake
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
dog
was
performing
successfully
in
proficiency
testing.
after
all,
that's
why
we
train
the
dogs.
and--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
your
honor,
in
our
view,
we
don't
think
it's
--
it's
an
appropriate
role
for
the
court
to
delve
into
the
contours
of
the
training,
what
specific
methods
were
used
to
train
or
distract
or
--
you
know,
all
the
contours
that
they
bring
up
in
their
brief.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
not
--
you
would
have
to
accept
it,
your
honor,
on
its
face.
i
think
you
--
in
a
record
like
this
--
and
i
think
this
record
is
clearly
sufficient
--
and,
ultimately,
that's
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
hold
--
what
you
have
in
the
record
is
evidence--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
it
would
be
close--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--close
to
that.
we
would
ask
whether
or
not
the
dog
successfully
treated
--
completed
training
by
a
bona
fide
organization.
and
here--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--certification
is
not
required.
it
may
be
one
way
that
the
police
department
could
establish
reliability
a
different
way,
but
certification
itself
is
not
required
when
you
have
a
record
of
the
type
of
training
that
you
have
here.
we
do
think
that
you
could
put
the
handler
on
the
stand
and
ask
about
the
reliability,
certain
questions
about
reliability.
we
don't
think,
in
a
record
like
this,
the
judge
would
say,
well,
it
says
that
he
completed
120
hours
in
narcotics
detection
at
the
apopka,
florida
police
department,
and
40
hours
at
the
dothan
police
department,
so--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
one
area
where
the
court
mentioned
that
was
in
the
lago
vista
case,
where
it
talked
about
the
importance
of
clear
rules
for
police
officers--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--absolutely.
and
the
same
way
that
when
an
officer
provides
evidence
for
a
search
warrant,
we
don't
demand
the
training
of
the
officer,
what
schools
he
went
to
or
what
specific
courses
he
had
in
probable
cause.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
unusual
case,
and
it
probably
would
be
captured
by
the
other
factors;
but,
what
we
meant
by
including
that
is
that
there's
no
limit
on
the
types
of
evidence
that
the
police
could
submit
to
show
reliability.
if
you
didn't
have
certification
or
a
formal
training
program,
the
fact
that
there
was
evidence
that
a
dog
like
aldo
successfully
performed
in
weekly
training
over
the
course
of
the
year,
and
the
police
submitted
the
records,
like
the
records
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case
at
pages
106
and
116,
that
might
be
another
way
of
establishing
reliability.
but
the
--
the
central
way
would
be
showing
that
the
dog
successfully
completed
training
or
that
the
dog
was
certified.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
requirement
of
certification
for
handlers.
again,
this
is
something
that
varies
among
states.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
that's
correct.
and
officer
wheetley
here,
of
course,
had
been
trained.
he
had
gotten
a
160-hour
course
in
narcotics
detection,
and
had
done
training
with
aldo
in
the
dothan,
alabama
police
department,
40
hours
there.
and
these
dog
--
the
dog,
aldo,
and
officer
wheetley
had
worked
together
for
about
a
year
before
the
time
of
the
search.
the
handlers
themselves
are
going
to
be
in
the
best
position
to
know
the
dogs
and
evaluate
their
reliability.
and
they
have
a
strong
incentive
to
ensure
the
dogs
are
reliable.
that's
both
because
they
don't
want
to
miss
contraband
when
it's
available
--
when
it
exists
in
the
field;
and,
also,
they
don't
want
to
be
put
into
harm's
way.
the
traffic
stop,
in
particular,
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
encounters
police
officers
face.
they're
not
going
to
want
to
be
working
with
a
dog
that
is
consistently
putting
the
officer
in
a
position
of
searching
cars
based
on
an
alert
when
that
dog
is
not
reliable
in
predicting
the
presence--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--we
don't
think
the
fourth
amendment
puts
a
number
on
it.
this
court
has
rejected
a
numerical
conception
of
probable
cause.
but
with
respect
to--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--but,
but
let
me
--
let
me
address
the,
the
south
wales
study,
your
honor,
which
i
think
is
the
one
that
you
were
referring
to
and
it's
the
primary
one
relied
on
by
the
other
side.
in
that
case
they
reported
that
over
the
course
of
several
years
the
dogs'
alerts
resulted
in
discovery
of
drugs
only
26
percent
of
the
time.
but
there
is
another
part
of
that
study
which
doesn't
come
up
in
the
amicus
briefs,
and
that's
that
in
60
percent
of
the
other
cases
the
individuals
admitted
to
using
drugs
or
being
in
the
proximity
of
drugs.
and
if
you
include
that
in
the
universe
of
accurate
alerts,
as
you
should,
then
the
number
becomes
70
percent
of
dogs
accurately
alerting.
that
70
percent
based
on
the
primary
study
that
they
rely
upon--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--well,
primarily
by
looking
at
whether
the
dog
has
successfully
completed
training.
and
you're
right,
dogs
do
go
out
of
service
when
they
reach
a
certain
age.
dogs,
like
humans,
become
old
and
impaired
over
time.
but
--
but
looking
at
weekly
training
records,
like
are
available
in
this
case,
dogs
that
successfully
perform
week
in
and
week
out
in
training
are
going
to
successfully
perform
in
the
--
in
the
real
world.
and,
after
all,
i
think
the
most
problematic
aspect
of
the
challenges
to
the
reliability
of
these
dogs
is
that
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
country
at
the
state
and
federal
level,
law
enforcement
agencies
around
the
world,
and
law
enforcement
agencies
that
protect
this
court
rely
on
detection
dogs
as
reliable
predictors
of
the
evidence
of
contraband,
evidence
of
the
presence
of
explosives
or
likewise.
and
this
is
an
area
where
we
think
that
a
page
of
logic
and
experience
is
worth
a
volume
--
a
page
of
experience
and
history
is
worth
a
volume
of
logic.
these
dogs
have
been
used
and
are
being
used
in
many
settings
across
the
country
and
across
the
world
today.
and
the
reason
they
are
being
used
is
because
the
people
who
work
with
them
know
that
they
are
reliable
and
--
and
know
by
experience
that
they
are
reliable.
and
that's
one
of
the
central
problems
we
have
with
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
is
that
ultimately
this
court
should
distrust
the
reliability
of
the
dogs.
and
again--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
defendant
can
call
the
handler
and
can
ask
those
sorts
of
questions.
i
think
the
court
would
cut
it
off
if
you
got
into
questions
like,
well,
did
they
use
the
play-reward
or
the
scent-imprinting
method
in
training.
well,
what
specifics
--
because
i
think
that
delves
too
far
into
the
details.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
yes,
and
that
was
done
here.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
cueing
is
not
part
of
this
case
because
they
haven't
argued
that
the
dog
was
cued.
the
argument
is
the
dog
was
just
sort
of
inherently
reliable.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
and
our
position
is,
is
that
you
can
inquire
into
cueing
during
this
hearing,
that
the
defendants
can
--
can
argue
that
the
dog
was
cued,
and
in
--
in
the
course
of
that
argument
you
might
be
able
to
get
into
those
sorts
of
things.
that's
different
than
the
challenge
that
was
made
here.
there
wasn't
a
cueing
challenge
made
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
just
go
back
to
one
of
the
premises
of
your
question,
which
is
that
the
dog
in
this
case
didn't
accurately
alert.
the
dog
in
this
case
accurately
alerted
to
the
odor
of
illegal
narcotics.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
right.
and,
and
i
think
that's
another
central
problem
with
the
florida
supreme
court's
decision,
is
this
notion
that
alerts
to
so-called
residual
odors
aren't
indicative
of
the
dog's
reliability.
a
dog's
alert
to
the
lingering
odor
of
methamphetamine
which
was
in
the
car,
must
have
been
in
the
car
in
this
case,
is
just
as
accurate
as
a
dog's
alert
to
the
presence
of
methamphetamine
itself
in
the
car.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
probable
cause
in
this
court's
precedents
looks
not
only
to
the
likelihood
that
contraband
would
be
present,
but
the
likelihood
that
there
would
be
evidence
of
a
crime.
and
that
would
include
the
so-called
residual
odor,
evidence
that
drug
paraphernalia,
someone
had
recently
smoked
illegal
narcotics
in
the
vehicle,
or
the
like.
so
the
alert
to
the
so-called
residual
odor
of
drugs
is
just
as
probative
to
the
question
of
probable
cause
as
an
alert
to
drugs
themselves.
the
fact
that
aldo
alerted
to
the
door
handle
area
of
the
car
doesn't
negate
in
any
way
the
probable
cause
that
officer
wheetley
had
to
search.
what
it
means
is
that
the
door
handle
area
was
where
the
scent
of
the
illegal
narcotics
was
the
strongest.
it
could
have
been
narcotics
coming
out
of
that
area,
or
coming
out
of
the
door
seam,
or
could
have
been
the
fact
that
someone
who
had
used
narcotics
was
using
the
door
handle
to
get
in
and
out
of
the
car.
second,
courts
can
determine
reliability
in
this
context.
they
would
look
to
the
performance
in
the
controlled
training
environment.
there
is
a
real
danger
with
suggesting
that
field
performance
records
are
--
are
a
permissible
foray
for
defendants
in
suppression
hearings
to
challenge
the
reliability
of
dogs
because,
one,
as
justice
alito
pointed
out,
it's
not
a
controlled
setting.
we
don't
know
whether
the
dog
did
alert
to
residual
odors
of
narcotics
that
had
been
in
the
car,
drugs
that
were
hidden
and
simply
not
found
during
the
relatively--
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
--i
think
they
could
ask
about
it,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
could
demand
the
performance
records
themselves.
and
that
would
be
a
huge
deterrent
to
law
enforcement,
even
maintaining
those
records.
third,
officer
wheetley
and
aldo
did
train
together
for
nearly
a
year
before
the
search
in
question.
they
did
complete
the
40-hour
drug
detection
seminar
at
the
dothan,
alabama,
police
department.
and
that
certificate's
at
page
105
of
the
record.
and
second,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
all
the
incentives
in
this
area
are
aligned
with
ensuring
the
reliability
of
drug
detection
dogs.
it's
not
in
the
police
interest
to
have
a
dog
that
is
inaccurate
in
finding
contraband
or
that
is
inaccurate
and
putting
an
officer
in
harm's
way.
humans
have
relied
upon
dogs
for
law
enforcement-related
purposes,
due
to
their
extraordinary
sense
of
smell,
for
centuries.
dogs,
trained
drug
detection
dogs
and
explosive
detection
dogs,
are
invaluable
members
of
the
law
enforcement
community
today.
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below,
which
would
act
as
a
serious
detriment
to
the
use
of
that
valuable
tool.
mr.
gregory
g.
garre
thank
you,
your
honor.
