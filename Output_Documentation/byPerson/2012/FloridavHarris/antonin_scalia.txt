justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
for
or
against
the
dog
this
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i
suppose
that
if
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
depended
upon
some
evidence
given
by
a
medical
doctor,
the
court
would
not
go
back
and
examine
how
well
that
doctor
was
trained
at
harvard
medical
school
and,
you
know,
what
classes
he
took
and
so
forth,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
coon
dogs
chasing
squirrels.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
i
thought
the
court
said
--
held
against
the
state.
i
thought
what
the
florida
court
was
saying
is
if
you
didn't
produce
it,
the
dog's
evidence
would
not
be
allowed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
search
is
invalid.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
worse.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
requirement
too?
that's
a
constitutional
requirement,
that
the
dog
training
doesn't
count
unless
it's
training
with
the
officer
who
is
using
the
dog?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
fine.
counsel
can
bring
that
up.
counsel
can
bring
that
up
at
the
hearing
before
the
judge.
but
--
but
i
understood
this
to
be
a
--
a
requirement.
you
never
even
get
to
that
hearing,
because
there's
no
evidence
that
this
dog
was
ever
trained
with
this
policeman.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
therefore
end
of
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
--
what
--
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
incentives
here?
why
would
a
police
department
want
to
use
an
incompetent
dog?
is
that
any
more
likely
than
that
a
medical
school
would
want
to
certify
an
incompetent
doctor?
what
--
what
incentive
is
there
for
a
police
department?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
good
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
acquire
probable
cause,
you
go
in
and
there's
nothing
there.
you've
wasted
the
time
of
your
police
officers,
you've
wasted
a
lot
of
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
the
police
department
doesn't
care
about
that,
but
it
certainly
cares
about
wasting
the
time
of
its
police
officers
in
fruitless
searches.
justice
antonin
scalia
willy-nilly.
officers
just
like
to
search.
they
don't
particularly
want
to
search
where
they're
likely
to
find
something.
they
just
like
to
search.
so
let's
get
dogs
that,
you
know,
smell
drugs
when
there
are
no
drugs.
you
really
think
that
that's
what's
going
on
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
like
to
search
where
they're
likely
to
find
something,
and
that
only
exists
when
the
dog
is
well
trained.
it
seems
to
me
they
have
every
incentive
to
train
the
dog
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
assure
you
that
if
we
agree
with
you
there
will
be
a
whole
body
of
experts
that
will
spring
into
being
about
dog
training.
i
assure
you
that
that
will
be
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
counsel,
you're
defending
a
florida
supreme
court
opinion
which
says
“
must
”.
you
can't
just
say,
you
know,
i'm
not
asserting
any
particular
thing
is
necessary,
just,
you
know,
totality
of
the
circumstances.
you
have
an
opinion
here
in
which
the
florida
supreme
court
says
“
must
”.
it
must
include
the,
you
know,
the
field
training.
now,
do
--
do
you
disavow
that
or
--
or
do
you
want
us
the
ignore
it?
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
is
absent
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
and
you
nonetheless
hold
that
there
was
probable
cause,
then
“
must
”
does
not
mean
“
must
”,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are
likely
to
be
found
if
there
is
a
residual
odor
of
drugs,
even
though
the
drugs
are
no
longer
there.
so
it's
not
an
incompetent
dog
when
he
alerts
because
of
the
residual
odor.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
at
least
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
mothballs
in
this
case;
is
that
right?
there
are
no
mothballs?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
--
would
you
allow
counsel
to
ask
about
that?
