mr.
glen
p.
gifford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
no
canine
exception
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
for
probable
cause
to
conduct
a
warrantless
search.
if
that
is
true,
as
it
must
be,
any
fact
that
bears
on
a
dog's
reliability
as
a
detector
of
the
presence
of
drugs
comes
within
the
purview
of
the
courts.
this
can
encompass
evidence
of
initial
training,
certification,
maintenance
training
and
performance
in
the
field.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
i
do
understand
the
government
to
disagree
about
the
relevance
of
field
performance.
and
where
i
specifically
think
the
government
disagrees
is
on
the
level
of
detail
that
can
be
inquired
into
by
the
trial
court
on
any
of
these
elements.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
well,
the
florida
supreme
court
did
have
several
passages
in
its
opinion
where
it
talked
about
what
the
state
must
produce.
and
at
first
glance,
that
looks
rather
didactic.
however,
what
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
was
saying
there
was
that
if
this
--
these
records
exist,
the
state
must
produce
them.
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
state's
burden
of
proof
to
justify
a
warrantless
search.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
i
don't
believe
the
constitution
requires
it,
and
i
don't
believe--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
even
though
they
used
the
word
must.
i
think
that
the
must
concerns
performance
records
and
training
records
that
exist.
farther
down
in
the
opinion,
the
court
says
reasons
why
the
--
why
the
state
should
keep
and
present
performance
records--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--if
the
state
does
not
keep
field
performance
records,
that
is
a
fact,
that
is
a
lack
of
evidence
that
could
be
held
against
the
state
in
the
suppression
hearing.
and
it
shifts
the
focus
onto
providing
evidence
of
the
initial
training,
the
certification,
and
the
maintenance
training
that
can
show
to
the
trial
court
that
this
is
a
reliable
dog.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
they
did
use--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--the
court
did
use
the
word
must--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--but
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
specific
recipe
that
can't
be
deviated
from.
because,
in
addition
to
listing
the
records
that
must
be
produced,
the
florida
supreme
court
also
said,
and
all
other
evidence
that
bears
on
the
reliability
of
the
dog.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
so
it's
not
a
specific
recipe,
and
it's
talking
about
what
--
if
these
records
exist,
they
must
be
produced.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
i
don't
think
they
--
i
don't
think
they
require
field
performance
records
to
establish--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--they
said
what
the
government
must
produce
if
those
records
exist.
but
when
you
go
down
to
the
part
of
the
opinion
where
the
court
applies
the
law
to
the
facts,
the
court
didn't
just
say,
because
there
were
no
field
performance
records,
no
probable
cause,
we
close
up
shop,
conviction
reversed.
what
the
court
did
was
take
into
consideration
the
lack
of
field
performance
records,
the
lack
of
any
records
about
initial
training
and
certification
aside
from
the
fact
that
this
dog
had
a
certificate.
and
we
have
to
remember
that
this
certificate,
not
only
was
it
16
months
out
of
date,
it
wasn't
a
certificate
for
aldo.
it
was
a
certificate
for
aldo
and
a
seminole
county
deputy
together
as
a
team.
this
dog
was
never
certified
as
part
of
a
team
with
officer
wheetley
in
this
case.
and
the
certifications
in
this
area
are
team
certifications,
not
individual
certifications.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
no,
but
that's
an
indicator
of
reliability,
which
is
the
ultimate
test
here,
has
this
team
been
trained
and
certified
together--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--that's
correct,
there
is
no
such
evidence.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
no,
not
end
of
case.
the
fact
that
the
dog
wasn't
trained
with
this
policeman
means
that
you
need
to
look
for
evidence
--
other
evidence
of
reliability,
which
also
doesn't
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
well,
first,
this
weekly
training
is
maintenance
training.
it's
to
maintain
the
dog
at
a
level
of
proficiency
that
has
previously
been
established.
that
level
of
proficiency
hadn't
been
established
with
this
team
of
wheetley
and
aldo.
the
level
of
proficiency
that
had
been
established
was
with
wheetley
and
with
another
seminole
county
deputy.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
the
incentive
is
to
acquire
probable
cause
to
search
when
it
wouldn't
otherwise
--
otherwise
be
available.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
is
that
a
good
thing?
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
and
--
and
you've
invaded
the
privacy
of
an
individual
motorist
who
was
innocent.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
the
incentive
of
the
officer
to
be
able
to
conduct
a
search
when
he
doesn't
otherwise
have
probable
cause
is
a
powerful
incentive.
as
the
court
has
said,
ferreting
out
crime
is
a
competitive
enterprise.
and
also,
these--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--officers
like
to
search
so
that
they
can
get
probable
cause
so
that
they
can
advance
their
career.
forfeiture
is
also
an
issue.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
but
the
question
goes
back
to
the
dog's
reliability,
what
the
officer
knows
objectively,
and
what
that
officer
can
demonstrate
on
the
stand
to
the
trial
court
to
determine
by
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
that
dog
is
well
trained.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
it
is
reversible
error
if
we
know
what
went
into
the
training
and
certification.
was
that
training
and
certification
sufficient
to
prove
the
dog
was
reliable?
did
it
include
the
use
of
blanks
and
did
the--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--no,
not
necessarily
experts,
but
simply
the
--
the
officer
who
participated
with
the
dog
can
testify
as
to
what
he
and
the
dog
went
through
to
obtain
the
training
certificate
and
the
--
and
the
certification.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
those
experts
already
exist.
they
--
they
are
prevalent
in
the
case
law
already.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
that
would
be
one
of
several
showings
that
would
make
the
training
records
adequate.
also,
you
would
want
to
know
whether
there
were
distractors
used
in
the
field.
however,
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
supports,
except
--
and
this
is
arguable;
the
parties
dispute
this
--
for
the
maintenance
training.
all
the
state
had
for
the
initial
training
with
deputy
morris,
not
with
deputy
wheetley,
was
a
certificate:
one
certificate
that
said
this
dog
was
trained
by
the
apopka
police
department
for
120
hours
with
deputy
morris;
another
certificate
saying
that
this
dog
was
certified
by
drug
beat
narcotics
certifications,
again
with
deputy
morris,
for
1
year.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
no.
this
court
in
--
in
a
number
of
circumstances
has
provided
examples
that
can
guide
a
court
in
probable
cause
determinations.
in
illinois
v.
gates,
under
the
old
aguilar-spinelli
test,
the
court
specified
where
evidence
on
one
prong
can
be
so
strong
that
it
substitutes
for
evidence
on
another
prong.
in
ornelas,
the
court
pointed
to
local
knowledge
that
can
be
relied
upon,
such
as
the
winter
climate
in
milwaukee.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
that
is
--
that
is
not
the
holding
on
which
i'm
relying
here.
the
holding
on
which
i'm
relying
is
that
training
and
certification
alone,
the
mere
fact
of
training
and
certification
alone,
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
the
dog's
reliability.
and
as
to
the
language
about
“
must
”,
remember,
the
florida
supreme
court
didn't
just
say
that
the
failure
to
produce
one
of
these
elements
necessitated
reversal.
it
then
went
and
engaged
in
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
and
several
lower
courts
applying
that
case,
applying
harris,
have
reached
the
same
conclusion.
in
two
of
those
cases--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--“
must
”
means
“
must
”
if
the
state
has
the
records.
if
the
records
exist,
then
the
state
must
produce
them
because
it
bears--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--i
read
that
as:
if
those
records
exist,
the
state
must
produce
them,
because
not
only
does
it
bear
the
burden
of
proof;
it's
the
only
party
that
can
produce
these
records
because
it
keeps
the
dog.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
if
that
--
if
the
training
is
sufficient,
if
it
has
those
elements
that
demonstrate
that
the
dog
is
reliable,
those
are
the
circumstances.
you
have
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
there
and
those
circumstances
don't
include
any
field
performance.
and,
yes,
under
that
circumstance,
a
trial
court
can
find
the
dog
to
be
reliable.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
well,
you
don't
know
whether
they're
cases
of
false
alerts
or
not,
because
the
state
will
always
point
to
the
possibility
of
residual
odor
as
a
reason.
and
we
know
from
the
studies
that
have
been
cited
in
the
briefs
that
there
are
other
reasons
that
dogs
alert
when
that
alert
cannot
be
verified.
handler
cueing
is
identified
as
the
chief
one.
and
simply
dogs
make
mistakes.
dogs
err.
dogs
get
excited
and
will
alert
to
things
like
tennis
balls
in
trunks
or
animals,
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
well,
what
you
can
infer
is
this
dog
is
not
a
very
accurate
indicator
of
probable
cause,
because
probable
cause
tests
whether
drugs
are
likely
to
be
found
in
a
search
that
follows
an
alert.
if
the
dog's--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--but
if
a
dog
has
--
but
if
a
dog
has
previously
alerted
and
no
drugs
have
been
found
because
the
dog's
hyperacuity
causes
him
to
smell
drugs
that
were
there
two
days
or
two
weeks
ago,
then
the
next
time
that
dog
alerts,
it's
less
likely,
the
probability
declines
that
drugs
will
be
found.
it
goes
to
what
probable
cause
measures,
rather
than
what
the
dog
training
and
certification
community
measure,
and
that
is,
the
likelihood,
the
reasonable
probability,
that
drugs
will
be
found
following
the
search.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
that's
correct.
and
--
and
the
difference
is
that
--
that
the
police
officer
can
describe
what
he
has
smelled
and
can
say,
i
smell
marijuana.
all
the
dog
tells
the
police
officer
is,
i
smell
something
i
was
trained
to
detect,
perhaps,
if
i'm
operating
correctly.
but
getting
to
this
--
this
issue
of
residual
odor,
our
position
is
that
an
alert
where
no
drugs
are
found
means
that
the
dog
--
that
--
it
detracts
from
probable
cause
in
that
instance.
but
that's
not
the
only
rule
available
to
the
court.
residual
odor,
whether
an
alert
was
to
residual
odor
and
is
therefore
correct
and
accurate,
is
something
that
can
be
litigated.
in
one
of
the
lower
courts
that
decided
the
case
after
the
florida
supreme
court,
the
court
looked
to
the
field
performance
records,
and
it
found
several
of
them
well
supported
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
alert
was
probably
to
the
odor
of
drugs;
several
it
didn't
find.
so
that
is
an
issue
that
can
be
litigated.
another
possibility
is--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--no,
it
doesn't
mean
that
there
wasn't
residual
odor.
but,
again,
you
go
back
to
what
probable
cause
measures,
i
believe.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
didn't
demand
evidence
of
residual
odor.
what
it
did
is
it
said
that
if
field
performance
records
exist,
then
the
state
can
explain
unverified
alerts
in
the
field
as
residual
odor,
and
then
a
court
can
then
evaluate
that.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
well,
this
court
has
always
hesitated
to
assign
percentages
to
probable
cause;
but,
in
the
lower
courts,
once
you
get
below
50
percent,
probable
cause
is
much
less
likely
to
be
found,
assuming
that
there
is
no
other
corroborative
evidence,
no
other
reasonable
suspicion
factors.
i'd
like
to
talk
briefly
about
the
oregon
supreme
court
and
what
that
court
did
in
several
cases.
helzer
and
foster
decided
in
2011,
independently
of
the
florida
supreme
court
decision,
doesn't
cite
--
in
foster,
the
oregon
supreme
court
had
a
dog
that
trained
initially
with
the
same
handler,
unlike
here,
where
the
evidence
was
very
strong
as
to
the
features
of
the
training
and
certification
program,
and
where
that
dog
had,
i
believe,
a
66
percent
field
performance
record.
now,
the
court
in
foster
said
that
the
dog's
reliability
can
be
established
by
training,
certification,
and
performance
in
the
field.
the
court
added
that
it
didn't
think
that
performance
in
the
field
was
the
most
reliable
measure,
but
it's
relevant,
and
the
court
considered
that
66
percent
percentage.
but
then,
on
the
same
day,
in
helzer,
there
was
a
dog
that
trained
initially
with
a
different
handler,
that
the
handler
ultimately
testified
to
very
few
details
of
the
ongoing
training
and
the
certification.
in
foster,
the
certification
was
with
an
organization
that
required
a
90
percent
success
rate.
in
helzer,
there
was
no
such
testimony.
and
this
officer,
like
the
officer
here,
didn't
keep
field
performance
records
when
the
dog
alerted
and
no
drugs
were
found.
in
helzer,
the
court
found
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
reliability.
and
i
believe
that
those
two
cases
demonstrate
what
is
a
--
what
is
a
correct
line
to
draw
in
navigating
what
is
reliable.
on
several
arguments
made
by
the
state,
the
argument
was
that
the
maintenance
training
included
blanks,
and
that
the
dog
did
not
alert
to
blanks.
the
record,
we
believe,
supports
the
florida
supreme
court's
conclusion
that
blanks
were
tested
--
the
dog
was
tested
on
blanks,
but
there
was
no
testimony
as
to
whether
the
dog
didn't
alert
on
those
blanks.
the
state
has
said
that
the
dog
was
subsequently
recertified.
i
don't
find
support
in
the
record
for
that.
at
a
suppression
hearing,
the
state
argued
--
the
officer
testified
that
the
dog
was
scheduled
for
another
certification,
but
we
don't
know
whether
the
dog
was
ever
recertified.
the
court
can
affirm
the
florida
supreme
court
simply
on
the
failure
to
produce
adequate
documentation
of
certification
and
initial
training,
and
on
the
fact
that
this
dog
was
never
certified
with
this
trainer
--
with
this
handler
and
didn't
initially
work
with
this
handler.
you
don't
have
a
dog
here
who
was
reliable
enough
to
demonstrate
probable
cause.
the
florida
supreme
court
so
concluded.
i
believe
its
conclusion
was
correct.
and
unless
there
are
additional
questions.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--it
can
constitute
probable
cause.
what
officer
wheetley
testified
to
in
this
case
was
he
believed
that
this
alert
was
to
residual
odor
on
the
door
handle--
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
--it
may.
it
may.
it
can
constitute
probable
cause
in
this
case.
officer
wheetley
testified
that
this
dog
alerted
to
the
door
handle.
and
in
his
prior
experience,
when
the
dog
alerts
to
the
door
handle,
it
means
that
someone
who
had
smoked
or
consumed
drugs
or
handled
drugs
had
touched
the
door
handle.
now,
if
officer
wheetley
had
testified
that
in
his
experience
when
he'd
seen
such
alerts
and
conducted
a
search,
drugs
were
found
inside
the
vehicle,
then
that
residual
odor
alert
would
support
probable
cause.
officer
wheetley
did
not
so
testify.
there
was
insufficient
evidence
that
this
residual
odor
alert
--
that
a
residual
odor
alert
of
this
nature,
without
finding
drugs
afterward,
supports
probable
cause.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
no.
no
mothballs
to
my
knowledge.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
glen
p.

no,
your
honor.
mr.

they
were
concerned
about
residual
odor
alerting
without
any
explanation
by
the
state
as
to
how
residual
odor
alerting
supports
probable
cause.
but
the
primary
basis
for
its
decision
was
the
lack
of
performance
records
and
the
lack
of
records
supporting
initial
training
and
certification
to
show
that
this
dog
was
reliable.
mr.
glen
p.
gifford
well,
i
don't
think
the
door
handle
itself
is
--
is
dispositive.
i
think
it's
the
door
handle
plus
the
lack
of
evidence
that
we
have
a
reliable
dog.
and,
again,
the
reason
you
need
a
reliable
dog,
evidence
on
what
training
and
certification
means,
is
that
there
are
no
standards,
no
standards
whatsoever
for
initial
training.
some
states
do
have
standards
for
training
and
certification.
florida
does
not.
and
no
standards
for
--
for
maintenance
training
as
well.
in
order
to
have
probable
cause,
you
have
to
know
what
that
certification,
what
that
training
means,
if
you
don't
have
standards
that
will
tell
that
for
you.
if
there
are
no
additional
questions,
i'll
conclude.
