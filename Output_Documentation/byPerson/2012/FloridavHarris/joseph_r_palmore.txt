mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
long
recognized
the
ability
of
trained
dogs
to
reliably
detect
target
odors
and
such
dogs
every
day
perform
critical
life
and
death
homeland
security
and
law--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes,
we
believe
that
an
alert
by
a
trained
dog
is
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
100
percent
of
the
time
is
of
course
not
required
for
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
it's
a
fair
probability
standard
and
certainty
is
not
required,
and
i
think
that
was
the
principal
and
fundamental
flaw
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
it
demanded
infallibility
where
infallibility
is
not
required.
in
terms
of
studies,
it
is
actually
well
studied--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i
think
what
the
court
--
of
course
reliability
is
important.
the
question
is
how
you
determine
reliability.
this
is
a
somewhat
unique
setting
where
the
law
enforcement
tool
is
actually
tested
initially
and
on
an
ongoing
basis
in
a
controlled
setting
to
establish
its
reliability.
your
honor
asked
what
the
standard
for
bona
fide
training
is.
we
think
the
--
the
important
point
is
the
outcome
of
the
training:
is
the
dog
proficient,
can
the
dog
reliably
detect
narcotics
odor
and
only
narcotics
odor
in
a
controlled
setting
where
false
positives
and
false
negatives
can
accurately
be
measured?
that
record
is
established
here.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
we
--
i
think
we
do
know
what
it
means,
your
honor.
there
are
two
different
showings
that
are
made
here.
there
is
a
formal
training
and
formal
certification,
both
for
the
dog
and
the
handler
separately,
and
then
a
separate
training,
formal
training
together.
but
then,
just
as
important,
you
have
ongoing
but
less
formal
proficiency
exercises
conducted
by
the
handler
in
which
the
dog,
in
a
controlled
setting
where
errors
could
reliably
be
identified,
performed
quite
strongly,
including
2
days
before
the
arrest
here.
so
that's
ja
113
on
june
22nd,
the
dog
performed
perfectly
in
a
controlled
setting.
and
we
have
--
there
are
records
in
this
case
going
back
several
months
before
the
arrest
and
several
months
after
the
arrest
showing
that
--
that
this
dog
passed
the
test,
this
dog
was
reliable.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
think
it
is.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes,
i
think
the
judge
can
ask
those
kinds
of
questions.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
there
is
a
question
--
there
are
a
couple
sub-issues
here.
the
principal
vice
of
the
florida
supreme
court
was
in
imposing
an
unprecedented
and
inflexible
set
of
evidentiary
obligations
that
are
part
of
the
government's
affirmative
case
that
the
government
has
to
always
introduce
any
time
it
seeks
to
establish
probable
cause
based
on
a
dog
alert.
we
think
that's
fundamentally
misplaced
for
a
--
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
the
question
of
what
the
government
--
what
are
fair
game
questions
for
a
defendant
to
ask
once
the
handler
is
on
the
stand
is
a
--
is
a
different
question.
and--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
--
the
critical
aspect
of
reliability
in
this
context
is
the
dog's
performance
in
a
controlled
setting.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
don't
think
so,
certainly
not
as
a
routine
basis.
the
kind
of
burden
that
that
might
impose
on
law
enforcement
we
don't
think
is
justified.
that's
a
separate
question
from
whether
the
defendant
can
ask
the
handler,
if
the
handler
is
on
the
stand,
about
field
performance,
and
then
the
court
can
give
that
answer
whatever
weight
is
appropriate.
we
think,
typically,
an
answer
on
field
performance
is
not
going
to
be
material.
it's
not
going
to
be
helpful.
because
the
problem
is
in
the
field,
when
a
dog
alerts,
the
dog
is
trained
to
alert
to
the
odor
of
drugs.
it's
like
a
--
what
the
--
florida
supreme
court
wanted
a
batting
average,
a
batting
average
that
would
be
calculated
when
we
know
the
number
of
at
bats,
but
we
don't
know
in
many
cases
whether
there
was
a
hit
or
an
out.
so
we
had
a
fraction
where
we
know
the
denominator
but
not
the
numerator.
the
answer
to
the
florida
supreme
court's
question
and
concern
about
reliability,
again,
is
to
go
back
to
the
controlled
setting,
where
we
know
what's
a
hit
and
what's
an
out,
and
we
can
calculate
a
reliable
batting
average.
that
needs
to
be
where
the
focus
should
be
in
determining
the
reliability
of
a
dog.
and
there
should
--
there's
no
reason
to
constitutionalize
the
process
or
the
training
methodologies
that
get
you
to
that
point.
what
matters
is,
is
this
dog
successful
in
a
setting
in
which
we
can
measure
success.
and
i
think
that
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
the
florida
court
was
basically
alone
in
establishing
these
unprecedented
and
inflexible
sets
of
evidentiary
requirements.
there
is
a
large
body
of
case
law
in
the
lower
courts
on
the
reliability
of
drug
detection
dogs
going
back
30
or
40
years,
and
there
are
no
other
courts,
no
other
appellate
courts
to
be
sure,
that
have
imposed
these
kinds
of
requirements
on
law
enforcement
when
it
seeks
to
establish
probable
cause
for
a
detection
--
for
after
a
detection
dog
alerts.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
in
general.
there
is
some
diversity
across
the
courts,
but
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
judge
gorsuch's
opinion
in
the
ludwig
case
from
the
tenth
circuit,
or
the
jones
case
from
the
virginia
supreme
court,
you
see
approaches
that
are
basically
sound,
where
courts
have
confidence
that
if
law
enforcement
comes
in
and
says,
this
dog
is
trained
and
has
demonstrated
proficiency
in
a
training
setting,
that
that
dog
is
generally
reliable.
and
i
think,
as
mr.
garre--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--yes.
those
questions
can
be
asked.
but
i
think
it's
critical,
as
mr.
garre
pointed
out,
that
the
courts
not
constitutionalize
dog
training
methodologies
or
hold
mini
trials
with
expert
witnesses
on
what
makes
for
a
successful
dog
training
program.
because,
as
mr.
garre
said,
the
government
has
critical
interests,
life
and
death
interests,
that
it
stakes
on
the
reliability
of
these
dogs.
so
the
u.s.
marshals
use
dogs
to
protect
federal
judges.
the
federal
protective
services
use
dogs
to
keep
bombs
out
of
federal
buildings.
the
tsa
uses
dogs
to
keep
bombs
off
of
airplanes.
fema
uses
dogs
to
find
survivors
after
hurricanes.
there
are
32
k-9
teams
in
the
field
right
now
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
looking
for
survivors
of
hurricane
sandy.
so,
in
situation
after
situation,
the
government
has
in
a
sense
put
its
money
where
its
mouth
is,
and
it
believes
at
an
institutional
level
that
these
dogs
are
quite
reliable.
and
i
think
the
courts--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--no,
there
--
well,
i
think
any
dog
could
be
trained
in
either
discipline.
and
if
you
look
at
the
scientific
working
group
on
detection
dogs
report
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
report
explains
that
the
same
general
methodologies
and
the
same
different
--
same
general
approach
is
used
to
train
each
kinds
of
dogs.
but,
typically,
a
drug
detection
dog
will
not
be
cross-trained
on
explosives.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
i
don't
know
the
specific
answer
to
that.
i
think
once
a
dog
kind
of
chooses
a
major,
that's
what
they
stick
with.
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--right.
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
these
dogs
have
to
meet
--
have
to
pass
proficiency
in
an
initial
training
program,
and
then
they,
as
is
shown
in
the
record
here
in
great
detail,
they
show
proficiency
on
an
ongoing
basis,
including
in
this
case
two
days
before
the
arrest.
thank
you,
your
honor.
