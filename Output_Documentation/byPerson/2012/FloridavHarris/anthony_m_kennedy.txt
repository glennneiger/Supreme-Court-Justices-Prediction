justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
judges
do
this
thousands
of
times
in
thousands
of
cases.
they
ask:
was
the
tip
reliable?
there
are
any
number
of
permutations.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
was
--
made
a
correct
determination
in
determining
that
there
was
or
was
not
sufficient
cause
for
the
police
to
proceed.
it
just
happens
every
day.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
understand
the
government
to
disagree
with
that
general
position?
in
other
words,
the
trial
court,
if
you
have
an
attorney
that's
really
concerned
about
the
training
of
this
dog,
they
can
ask
about
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
did
you
say
it
can
or
it
can't?
