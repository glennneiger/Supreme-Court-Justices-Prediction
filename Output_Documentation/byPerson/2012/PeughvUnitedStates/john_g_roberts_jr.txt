chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-62,
peugh
v.
united
states.
mr.
kinnaird.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
have
a
law
that
sentencing
judges
must
consider
these
factors,
and
one
of
the
factors
is
whether
the
defendant
has
strong
family
ties
that
will
be,
you
know,
jeopardized
or
whatever,
if
he's
incarcerated.
you
don't
want
to
take
him
away
from
his
family,
because
that
will
penalize
other
people.
and
then
congress
thinks
that's
not
a
good
idea
and
they
take
that
away.
is
that
an
ex
post
facto
violation?
it
increases
the
factors
of
--
or
the
risk
that
the
defendant
will
get
a
higher
sentence
before
he
could
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
he
had,
you
know,
a
particular
family
situation.
later,
he
could
not.
that's
a
change
in
what
the
sentencing
court
must
consider
and
is
to
his
prejudice.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
under
--
under
our
modification
of
the
guidelines
approach,
isn't
that
just
a
list
of
factors
that
the
court
should
consider,
or
must
consider?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
law
said
the
court
must
begin
with
a
comparison
of
what
the
average
sentence
is
across
the
country,
okay?
and
the
data
collection
over
time
becomes
more
sophisticated
and
they
can
give
you
a
more
accurate
number
for
what
the
average
sentence
is.
and
it
turns
out
it's
higher
than
what
their
informal
survey
was
before.
is
that
an
ex
post
facto
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no.
it'd
be
the
same
--
it'd
be
the
same
thing.
one
of
the
things
that
the
sentencing
commission
considers
is,
of
course,
what
the
average
sentences
were
around
the
country.
and
let's
say
that
the
law
says
that's
something
you
have
to
consider,
and
the
technology
or
the
range
of
--
of
judges
that
they
can
survey
becomes
more
sophisticated,
the
number
goes
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
so
the
answer--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
so
the
answer
to
my
question
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
just
getting
more
accurate
information
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause
in
the
framework
that
you've
set
forth?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
who
prevails?
the
government
or
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
feigin.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
--
i'm
sorry.
are
you
finished?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
good
advocate.
let's
say
you
had
a
statute
--
not
a
guideline,
a
statute
--
that
said
a
sentence
for
a
particular
offense
will
be
5
years,
but
the
judge
can
lower
it
to
4
years
if
he
thinks
it
would
be
a
manifest
injustice
to
sentence
to
5
years.
that
provision
is
later
repealed.
now
it
just
says
that
the
sentence
should
be
5
years.
does
that
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
matter
how
narrow
--
no
matter
how
narrow
the
original
grant
of
discretion
is?
in
other
words,
only
in
the
case
of
manifest
injustice,
or
however
dramatic
you
want
to
limit
the
available
discretion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
would
--
how
would
a
court--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--right.
how
would
a
court
go
about
answering
that
question?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it's
a
statistical
evaluation
of
the
kind
we
were
talking
about.
you
look
and
you
say,
well,
it's
only
once
in
a
blue
moon
that
the
judge
invokes
the
manifest
injustice
provision,
so
it's
not
increasing
the
risk.
on
the
other
hand,
well,
every
four
out
of
five
judges
do
and
therefore
it
is
an
increase.
is
that
how
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
can
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
kinnaird,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-62,
peugh
versus
united
states.
