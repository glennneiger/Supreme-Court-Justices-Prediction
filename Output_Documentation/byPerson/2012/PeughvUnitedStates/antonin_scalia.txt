a
mandatory
schedule?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
mandatory
schedule,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
change
of
the
law
if
--
if
the
law
does
not
require
the
guidelines
to
be
imposed.
your
--
your
case
rests
upon
the
proposition
you
stated
at
the
outset,
which
is
that
the
ex
post
facto
law
applies
--
prohibition
applies
--
if
there
is
a
substantial
possibility
of
--
of
a
higher
sentence
--
was
that
the
language
you
used?
justice
antonin
scalia
significant
risk.
suppose
--
suppose
the
district
judge
for
the
federal
district
in
which
somebody's
crime
was
committed
was
a
--
a
bleeding
heart
judge.
he
always
gave
the
lowest
sentence
possible,
and
everybody
knew
that.
and
he
is
replaced.
he
retires
after
the
arrest,
after
the
crime,
and
he
is
replaced
by
maximum
john,
who
everybody
knows
gives
the
highest
sentence
every
time.
ex
post
--
ex
post
facto
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
statutes
allowing
relatives
and
friends
of
the
victim
to
testify?
let's
assume
a
crime
committed
before
--
a
horrible
crime
committed
before
that
statute
is
enacted,
does
it
violate
the
ex
post
facto
law
to
give
effect
to
that
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
don't
--
don't
you
think
it
creates
a
significant
risk--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
defendant
will
get
a
higher
sentence?
don't
you
think
that's
the
whole
object
of
the
law,
in
fact?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
--
is
that
what
--
who
says
that
they're
the
benchmark
that
you
start
with?
where
is
that
writ?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
court
--
a
court
must
begin
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
--
your
case
depends,
it
seems
to
me,
upon
the
proposition
that
significant
risk
is
only
applicable
at
the
sentencing
stage.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true.
i
mean,
what
--
why
--
why
would
that
be
so?
what
if
--
what
if
you
have
a
new
law
that
permits
evidence
to
come
in,
in
a
criminal
trial
that
previously
was
not
allowed
to
come
in,
let's
say
the
testimony
of
a
wife
or
whatever.
i
think
the
law
is
pretty
well
established
that
that
change
in
procedure
does
not
violate
the
ex
post
facto
law.
and
your
response
to
that
is:
well,
that's
not
sentencing;
it's
trial.
so
what?
i
mean,
if
--
certainly
making
a
conviction
more
likely
is
--
is
even
worse
than
making
a
higher
sentence
more
likely.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
saying
that
the
sentencer
has
to
consider
testimony
from
the
victim
or
from
relatives
of
the
deceased,
that
--
that
change
in
sentencing
law
is
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
pertains
to
sentencing.
it
--
it
says
what
the
sentencing
authority,
the
judge
or
the
jury,
must
consider.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
evidence
brought
before
the
sentencer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
that
and
saying
that
the
--
the
guidelines
have
to
be
considered
by
the
sentencer.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
“
affix
a
higher
punishment
”,
in
the
words
of
calder
v.
bull?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
that's
a
question
at
all.
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
easy.
it
does
not
affix
a
higher
punishment,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
then
rely
on
garner,
but
not
on
calder
v.
bull.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
help--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
disagree
with
all
that,
by
the
way.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
statute
is
one
that
permits
10
days,
right?
sort
of
an
unusual
statute,
but
if
the
hypothetical
is
in
the
real
world,
the
statute
provides,
you
know,
10
days
to
life,
okay?
and
the
judge
thinks
10
days
is
okay.
i
think
that's
the
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
are
saying
that
it
doesn't
matter
because
they
are
advisory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is
reversible
error,
is
it
not,
simply
to
blindly
apply
the
guidelines
without
considering
the
factors
in
3553?
that's
reversible,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feigin,
i'm
under
the
impression
--
more
than
the
impression
i
know
--
that
the
sentencing
commission
can
make
a
revision
of
the
guidelines
retroactive.
can
it
only
do
that
for
revisions
that
lower
the
--
the
suggested
penalty
or
can
it
do
that
for
revisions
that
increase
it
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
for
lower,
okay.
because
if
it
could
increase
it,
then
it
would
be
violating,
according
to
your
friend,
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
