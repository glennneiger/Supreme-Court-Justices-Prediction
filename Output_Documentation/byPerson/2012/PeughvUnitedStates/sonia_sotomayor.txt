justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
what
your
definition
of
legal
consequence
is?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you're
taking
--
you're
disagreeing
with
the
proposition
of
our
older
cases
that
to
--
for
there
to
be
an
ex
post
facto
violation,
you
have
to
have
a
legal
consequence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
there's
a
--
there's
the
disconnect
for
me.
yes,
i
do
accept
that
the
district
courts
have
to
consider
the
guidelines,
but
how
do
you
tie
that
to
the
requirement
that
the
punishment
has
to
be
tied
to
the
guidelines?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
assuming
that's
changed
over
time.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
wasn't.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
you
tell
me
the
narrow
rule
that
you
would
propose--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--getting
back
to
justice
scalia--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--which
is
procedures
change
risks.
having
a
victim
testify
at
sentences
--
at
a
sentence
is
likely,
if
you
examined
it
statistically,
to
increase
--
increase
the
sentence.
so
assume
that's
the
set
of
hypotheticals.
you
change
it,
now
victims
can.
why
is
that
not
or
is
it
an
ex
post
facto
change?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
is
this
not
procedural?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
give
me
the
rule
where
i
can
draw
a
line
between
those
changes
that
are
permissible
and
those
that
are
not,
not
the
general
statement
you're
making,
because
both
increase
the
risk
of
a
higher
sentence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it
can't
be
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
answering
me
differently
now?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
answering
me
differently?
i
posed
exactly
the
question
that
justice
scalia--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
said
the
sentencing
--
the
assumptions
i
made
were
the
sentencing
law
changes,
victims
must
testify,
judges
must
consider
what
they
say,
and
after
5
years
it's
proven
that
when
victims
speak
the
sentences
are
higher.
is
that
a
substantive
or
a
procedural
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
asking
you
to
draw
it.
so
tell
me
what's
the
rule?
do
you
want
something
as
broad
that
says
even
that
kind
of
change
can
be
an
ex
post
facto?
and
if
you
don't,
articulate
how
i
draw
the
line?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
does
that
mean
to
you,
the
number
of
years
in
jail?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
as
limited
as
you
want
it
to
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
we
know
that's
miller.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
not
miller.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
have
you
had
--
are
you
aware
of
any
circuit
court
case
in
recent
time
where
a
circuit
has
reversed
the
lower
range
than
the
guideline,
basically
because
the
deviation
from
the
guideline
was
unreasonable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
are
you
fighting
this
proposition?
because
the
starting
point
doesn't
matter.
why
didn't
you
stick
to
your
old
position
that
judges
should
start
from
the
old
one
and
simply
consider
the
new
one?
why
this
whole
supreme
court
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
practically
speaking,
do
you
believe
it
makes
no
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
the
reason
that
miscalculating
a
guideline
is
considered
a
procedural
error?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
begs
the
question.
obviously,
if
we
hold
it's
a
procedural
error
to
miscalculate
the
guidelines,
using
the
guidelines
has
some
significant
importance
in
the
process.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know
there
is
a
lot
of
dispute
now
about
the
child
pornography
sentences.
let's
assume
--
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
--
a
judge
comes
in
and
says:
i
know
child
pornography
is
criminal,
but
i
don't
think
what
the
guidelines
are
imposing
are
fair
to
any
defendant.
so,
10
days
in
jail.
why
would
that
be
substantively
unreasonable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i'm
giving
you
exactly
what
the
judge
says.
you
don't
think
that
the
appellate
court
would
say
that's
substantively
unreasonable
because
it's
not
giving
due
deference
to
the
commission's
assessment
of
the
seriousness
of
this
crime?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
an
effort
of
to
reduce
unwarranted
disparities
in
federal
sentencing,
congress
passed
the
sentencing
reform
act.
the
act
created
the
united
states
sentencing
commission
which
is
tasked
with
promulgating
sentencing
guidelines.
those
guidelines
prescribe
a
sentencing
range
for
a
criminal
defendant
based
on
his
personal
characteristics
such
as
his
criminal
history
and
the
characteristics
of
his
offense.
as
enacted,
the
guidelines
were
meant
to
be
mandatory,
meaning
that
they
were
legally
binding
on
the
sentencing
court.
in
united
states
versus
booker,
this
court
found
that
the
mandatory
guidelines
were
unconstitutional.
to
cure
the
constitutional
problem,
the
court
struck
down
the
provisions
of
the
act
that
made
the
guidelines
mandatory
and
left
an
advisory
system
in
its
place.
after
booker,
the
guidelines
still
operate
to
channel
sentencing
discretion
and
avoid
excessive
disparities,
but
district
courts
may
now
sentence
outside
the
guidelines
subject
to
deferential
appellate
review.
the
sentencing
commission
periodically
reviews
and
amends
the
guidelines.
district
courts
are
directed
to
apply
the
most
up-to-date
version
of
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
of
sentencing
with
one
caveat.
they
are
not
to
do
so
if
applying
the
new
guidelines
would
violate
the
constitution's
ex
post
facto
clause
by
retroactively
increasing
the
punishment
for
the
defendant's
crime.
we
have
interpreted
this
clause
to
bar
laws
that
create
a
significant
risk
of
increasing
a
defendant's
punishment.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
now
that
the
guidelines
are
advisory;
it
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause
to
apply
a
new,
more
punitive
guideline
retroactively.
petitioner
marvin
peugh
was
convicted
of
multiple
counts
of
bank
fraud.
under
the
version
of
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
of
his
crime,
peugh
would
have
been
subject
to
an
advisory
guideline
range
of
30
to
37
months
of
imprisonment.
but
in
between
the
time
of
the
crime
and
peugh's
sentencing,
the
sentencing
commission
amended
the
guidelines
in
several
ways,
increasing
peugh's
guideline
range
to
70
to
87
months
of
imprisonment.
the
district
court
rejected
peugh's
argument
that
applying
the
new
guideline
range
violated
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
the
court
decided
that
a
within-guideline
sentence
was
appropriate
and
sentenced
peugh
to
70
months
of
imprisonment.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed,
applying
circuit
precedent
holding
that
retroactive
increases
in
the
advisory
sentencing
guidelines
do
not
implicate
an
ex
post
facto
concern.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reversed.
while
the
guidelines
are
no
longer
mandatory,
they
still
occupy
a
central
role
in
sentencing.
indeed,
they
are
designed
to
anchor
sentencing
discretion
in
order
to
promote
uniformity.
under
our
post-booker
precedents,
district
courts
are
required
to
begin
sentencing
by
calculating
correctly
the
guidelines
range.
failure
to
do
so
is
reversible
procedural
error.
district
courts
may
depart
from
the
range,
but
they
must
consider
the
extent
of
any
deviation
and
provide
us
sufficient
justification
to
support
the
variance.
court
of
appeals,
in
turn,
may
presume
a
within-guidelines
range
as
reasonable
and
may
further
consider
the
extent
of
any
deviation
from
the
guidelines
in
reviewing
a
sentence
for
reasonableness.
the
cumulative
effect
of
these
legal
rules
is
to
make
the
guidelines
the
loadstar
of
sentencing
in
the
federal
system,
even
in
a
post-booker
world.
both
common
sense
and
empirical
evidence
indicate
that
these
rules
will
steer
district
courts
to
give
more
within-guideline
sentences.
as
a
result,
increasing
the
applicable
sentencing
range
carries
a
significant
risk
of
an
increased
punishment.
for
these
reasons
which
we
elaborate
in
greater
detail
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
retroactively
applying
an
increase
in
the
applicable
guideline
range
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice,
justice
scalia
and
justice
alito
joined
in
part.
justice
alito
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
scalia
joins.
