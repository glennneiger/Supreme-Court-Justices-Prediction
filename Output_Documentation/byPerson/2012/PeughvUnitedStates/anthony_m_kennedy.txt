justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
--
your
--
your
brief
spent
some
time
on
statistics,
how
often
this
happens;
but
i
take
it
you're
not
saying
that
our
inquiry
is
a
statistical
one.
you're
simply
saying
that
the
statistics
bear
out
that
as
an
objective
legal
matter,
the
framework
that
you
are
explaining
to
us
is
and
must
be
followed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
it
be
ex
post
facto
in
--
in
the
hypothetical
justice
scalia
gave?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
you
remind
me
--
it's
in
the
briefs
--
if
a
sentence
is
appealed,
what
is
the
review
authority
of
the
appellate
court?
it
must
begin
with
the
guidelines
as
the
framework?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
when
it
comes
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
different.
the
court
of
appeals
begins
with
a
framework
of
whether
or
not
it's
within
the
guidelines.
that's
how
it
begins
to
measure
the
exercise
of
discretion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
i
agree
with
justice
ginsburg's
follow-up
question.
it
seems
to
me
you
avoid
the
question.
you
said,
oh,
well,
the
judge
looked
at
all
this
and
selected
the
sentence
he
did.
but
he
did
so
because
he
referred
to
the
later
guidelines
and
i
think
you
have
to
recognize
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'd
like
to
finish.
unless
i
am
wrong
under
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
--
that
gets
back
to
--
to
your
argument.
you're
--
i
sense
that
you
want
me
to
leave
the
bench
saying
the
guidelines
just
don't
make
any
difference.
suppose
--
suppose
the
district
judge
said,
you
know,
if
it
were
just
up
to
me,
i
would
give
this
lower
sentence,
but
the
guidelines
are
an
important
institutional
part
of
our
system.
uniformity
in
sentencing
is
--
is
desirable.
for
us
to
take
into
account
the
experience
of
other
--
of
other
courts
and
what
the
sentencing
commission
does
is
very
important.
therefore,
my
discretion
is
guided
by
these
guidelines.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
don't
want
me
--
you
don't
want
me
to
say
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
statement
to
me
was
--
and
to
us
earlier
--
was
that
there
is
no
legal
constraint
on
the
exercise
of
discretion.
i
agree,
the
judge
--
everybody
knows
the
judge
can
go
lower.
but
that
overlooks
the
fact
that
discretion
is
defined
by
legal
standards.
that's
how
we
begin
to
think
about
discretion.
that's
how
appellate
courts
weigh
discretion.
and,
again,
you
want
to
give
the
guidelines
no
effect
in
determining
how
that
discretion
is
shaped,
guided
and
exercised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
accept
the
fact
that
they
define
the
discretion
even
though
they
don't
constrain
it?
