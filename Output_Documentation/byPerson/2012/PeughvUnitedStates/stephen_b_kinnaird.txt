mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
sentencing
petitioner
marvin
peugh,
the
district
court
applied
the
2009
guidelines
sentencing
range
of
70
to
87
months,
rather
than
the
1998
range
of
37
to
46
months
applicable
at
the
time
of
his
offense.
retroactive
application
of
harsher
guidelines
passed
after
the
offense
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause
if
it
--
if
it
creates
a
significant
risk
of
increased
punishment.
now,
the
government
here
objects
that
a
guidelines
amendment
does
not
change
the
law,
but
that
is
incorrect.
the
guidelines
are
legislative
rules
that
define
a
term
of
a
mandatory
statute,
mainly
subsection
(a)(4)
of
section
18
usc.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no,
it's
a
term
of
a
--
of
a
mandatory
statute,
subsection--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--(a)(4)
of
--
of
18
usc
3553.
that
provision
requires
the
district
court
to
consider
the
guidelines
sentencing
range,
and
i'll
quote,
"established
for
the
applicable
category
of
offense
committed
by
the
applicable
category
of
offender.
"
so
in
1998,
the
guide
--
that
statute,
the
law
mandated
that
the
district
court
shall
consider,
as
applied
to
peugh's
offense
and
offender
category
a
sentencing
range
of
37
to
46
months.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor.
you
would
under
the
statute
have
to
follow
all
the
steps
in
the
rita/gall
framework,
but
the
district
court
is
always
able
to
consider
any
developments
that
it
wants.
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
change
of
law.
and
that
was
the
point
i
was
just
getting
to.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
substantial
--
significant
risk.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no,
because
the
ex
post
facto
clause
only
applies
to
laws
where
here
are
delegated
lawmaking.
and
here's
where
the
change
in
the
law
was,
your
honor.
as
i
mentioned,
in
1998,
the
law
required
the
district
court
to
consider
a
sentencing
range
of
37
to
46
months.
with
the
guidelines
amendment,
the
law
changed.
the
law
now
required
the
district
court
for
that
category
of
offender
and
offense
to
consider
as
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--well,
legal
consequence
refers
to
punishment.
that's
something
--
that's
something
different.
so
the
fact--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
the
legal
consequence
is
the
--
is
the
ultimate
sentence
imposed.
and
in
morales
and
lynce,
the
court
said--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--well,
the
court
said
in
morales
and
in
lynce
that
--
and
then
when
it
was
reconciled
in
two
different
formulations
of
the
standard
--
and
in
lynce,
the
court
said
it's
the
same
test
whether
you
increase
the
penalty
or
whether
you
determine
that
there's
a
sufficient
risk
of
increasing
the
penalty.
because
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--that's
the
standard
of
garner
and
morales,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
yes.
that
--
that
is
certainly
one
element
of
it.
but
the
--
the
fact
--
it's
not
exactly
the
same,
but
the
fact
is
that
even
under
the
advisory
guidelines,
the
change
in
law
creates
a
significant
risk.
and
when
you're
evaluating
significant
risk,
i
think
you
have
to
start
from
the
premise
that
the
ex
post
facto
violation
prohibits
an
increase
in
punishment
of
any
quantum,
even
of
1
day.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
and
that's
--
the
inquiry
in
garner
--
in
garner,
the
court
said
you
can
demonstrate
significant
risk
either
by
showing
that
the
risk
is
inherent
in
the
rule,
or
as
applied
to
your
sentence,
and
marshalling
the
evidence
of
the
practical
operation
of
the
rule.
so
statistical
evidence
is
--
is
evidence
of
the
fact
of
significant
risk
by
the
operation
of
that
framework.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
a
series
of
cases
saying
those
kind
of
changes
in
trial
procedure
would
not
be
within
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
you
have
to--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--well,
but
--
you
have
to
show
--
i
think
you
have
--
this
is
a
core
sentencing
law.
it
changes
the
law
of
punishment,
which
is
different
from
procedure.
and
in
miller,
the
court
said
that
when
there's
a
change
in
the
--
in
the
actual
sentencing
standard,
the
number
of
years,
that's
substantive,
not
procedural.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think
if
it
is
simply
a
change
in
the
mix
of
factors,
even
the
mandatory
factors,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
create
a
significant
risk.
but
the
guidelines--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
guidelines
are
distinctive,
because
they
are
the
actual
benchmark,
and
they
must
--
and
the
starting
point
for
any
sentencing.
it
is
critical
that
what
range
you
start
your
sentencing
analysis,
it's
going
to
affect
the
analysis
whether
you're
starting
at
a
range
of
20
to
30
months
or
120--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--that's
in
gall.
so
that's
in
--
a
construction
of
what's
implied
in
the
sentencing
format.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
yes.
yeah,
that's
the
--
and
the
court
not
only
must
begin
with
it,
must
be
cognizant
of
it
throughout
the
process.
and
any--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
don't
think
necessarily
so,
but
this
is
a
--
a
requirement
to
actually
consider
a
range.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think
it
may
be
if
you
had
the
exact
same
rita
and
gall
framework--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--and
that
--
that
framework
is
that
that
range
actually
is
the
benchmark
and
the
--
and
the
starting
point.
the
district
court
must
justify
any
deviation
from
that
range
--
and
this
is
language
from
gall
--
with
"sufficiently
compelling
justifications
to
support
the
degree
of
the
variance.
"
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
and
it
is
then
reviewed
on
appeal--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--it
would
be
--
i
think
it
would
be
likely
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
within
the
same
framework,
if
it's
the
mandatory
benchmark
with
appellate
review
for
substantive
reasonableness,
and
a
presumption--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--and
a
presumption
of
--
of
reasonableness
on
appeal
would
attach
to
that
standard.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think
if
it's
--
if
you
could
--
if
it's
an
actual
--
well,
i
don't
know
--
the
distinction
i
was
trying
to
draw
is
that
if
you
actually
--
if
the
statute
has
effectively
delegated
the
specification
of
a
specific
range,
as
opposed
to
just
a
data
factor
that
might
change
over
time.
and
that's
the
key
change
in
law
here.
as
i
mentioned,
1998,
had
to
consider
36
to
47
months.
with
the
guidelines
amendment,
the
law
changed.
he
now
must
consider
for
that
offense
and
offender
category
a
range
of
70
to
87
months,
and
--
and
--
as
the
mandatory
benchmark.
that's
a
change
in
the
law.
and
then
you
go
to
the
test
of
significant
risk.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think
it
makes
the
--
well,
we
have
an
argument
that's
specific
to
our
sentencing.
but
if
the
--
if
in
a
particular
case,
a
defendant
were
making
an
empirical
analysis,
that
may
diminish
the
chance
of
significant
risk,
but
with
a
caveat,
because
it's
not
just
sentences
within
the
guidelines
range,
it's
the
fact
that
the
district
court,
even
if
it
sentences
out
of
the
guidelines
range,
the
ultimate
amount
that
it
sentences
to
is
going
to
be
partially
determined
by
that
mandatory
benchmark.
and
that
--
that's
an
important
point.
and
as
i
said,
the
significant
risk
is
a
risk
of
any
increase
in
the
quantum
of
punishment.
so
it's
really,
is
there
a
significant
risk
that
had
he
been
--
had
the
old
guidelines
been
in
place
as
the
benchmark,
that
he
would
have
gotten
a
--
a
sentence
of
less
than
60
--
70
months.
and--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
think
it's
clear--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--perhaps,
but
again
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge,
so
we
look
to
current
data.
there
has
been
a
very
slight
gradual
decline,
but
there's
still
80
percent
of
the
sentences
are
either
within
the
guidelines
or
they're
below
the
guidelines
range
pursuant
to
a
guidelines
sanction
departure
motion
from
the
government.
so
it's
an
--
even
the
sentencing
commission
attributes
that
relationship
to
the
fact
that
it's
the
initial
starting
point
in
the
2012
booker
report.
so
i
think
it
has
a
profound
effect.
now,
if
the
court
wanted
to
rule
more
narrowly
in
this
case
on
significant
risk,
it
could.
and
it
could
adopt
a
rule
that
when
the
new
and
the
old
guidelines
ranges
do
not
overlap
at
all,
so
that
any
sentence
that
would
be
in
the
new
guidelines
range
would
have
required
an
upward
variance,
and
here
a
50
percent
upward
variance,
those
are
as
rare
as
hen's
teeth
in
the
--
in
the
district
courts
--
that
at
least
shows
at
a
minimum
a
significant
risk,
absent
any
indication
that
the
judge,
as
the
question
was
posed,
wasn't
going
to
apply
them
at
all.
here,
the
judge
specifically
and
expressly
deferred
to
the
2009
guidelines.
so
it's
clear
that
the
significant
risk
was
increased
by
this
change
in
the
law.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
think
my
response
would
be,
your
honor,
that's
not
--
that
particular
change
would
not
be
in
the
third
category
of
calder,
the
increase
in
punishment.
that
would
be
in
the
fourth
category,
in
the
changes
of
the
evidence
where
you
don't
even
look
to
significant
risk.
but
i
think
the
--
the
change
in
punishment,
at
a
minimum,
it's
the
sentencing
law
of
this
kind--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
--
well,
it
may,
depending
on
the
circumstances,
be
within
the
fourth
category,
but
not
under
the
third.
i
think
in
the
third--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
the
narrow
rule--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
don't
think
so,
because
the
court
has
generally
excluded
procedural
changes
even
if
you
could
show--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--because
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--right.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no.
what
miller
--
what
miller
said
--
in
miller
v.
florida
the
argument
was
made
that
a
change
in
the
sentencing
range,
the
presumptive
range,
was
a
change
in
procedure,
and
the
court
said,
no,
that's
substantive.
this
is
the
substantive
benchmark
that
is
applied.
it's
a
substance
standard.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
still
be
a
substantive
standard
regardless
of
whether
it's
binding
or
--
or
whether
it's
advisory.
it's
still
a
substantive
standard.
so
if
it's
a
change
in
the
substantive
sentencing
law,
you
go
to
significant
risk
analysis.
and
there
you
either
look
to
the
inherent
risk,
and
i
think
there
is
an
inherent
risk
in
this
framework
that
there's
going
to
be
some
increase
of
some
quantum
of
punishment
beyond
what
they
would
have
done
if
they'd
applied
the
older
guidelines
as
the
mandatory
benchmark.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
under
the
fact
that
it's
considered
a
procedural
law,
not
substantive.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--well,
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
i
may
have
misheard
your
--
your
hypothetical.
in
that
case,
it
may
very
well
be
a
sentencing
--
a
sentencing
law,
it
may
pass
that
threshold,
and
then
you
go
to
significant
risk.
i
would
say
significant
risk
is
more
difficult
to
determine
than
in
this
particular
case,
where
you
have
the
actual
starting
point,
an
actual
number,
which
has--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i
--
i
may
have
misheard,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
i
think
miller
did
draw
a
distinction.
there
are
procedures
that
are
involved
in
sentencing,
and
i'm
not
sure
if
the
court's
procedure-substance
cases
have
drawn
that
distinction.
if
it--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
think
--
i
think
the
court
could
draw
the
line
simply
on
substantive
standards
that
are
applied.
but
if
the
court
were
to
go
the
other
direction,
significant
risk--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
it
could
be.
i
mean,
or
at
least
--
you
know,
if
it's
a
mandatory
sentencing
factor,
something
like
that,
as
opposed
to--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--right.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
but
even
the
--
there
are
sentencing
factors
that
are
mandatory
other
than
the
guidelines
range.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
right.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
it
is
a
law
that
changes--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
think
it--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--but
--
but
the
court
in
garner,
in
lynce,
have
equated
that
with
increased
risk
of
significant
punishment.
and
that
--
the
importance
of
garner
is
that
it
recognizes
that
that
the
ex
post
facto
clause--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--yes.
i
think
--
but
garner
is
applying
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--okay.
so
what
garner
--
what
garner
does
say
is
that
you
look
to
the
significant
risk.
and
it's
important
for
ex
post
facto
--
ex
post
facto
jurisprudence,
because
the
exercise
of
discretion
can't
displace
ex
post
facto
protections.
you
have
to
look
at
the
effect
on
the
actual
punishment.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
the
review
authority
is
to
review
for
both
procedural
and
substantive
reasonableness.
so
procedural
i
think
has
been
interpreted
to
look
at
whether
there
was
a
correct
calculation,
whether
they
--
they
did
not
treat
it
as
mandatory,
that
they
considered
it
as
the
benchmark
and
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
yes.
i
was
getting
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
it
is.
and
the
second
step
is
substantive
reasonableness
review
and
the
court
has
held
that
an
appellate
presumption
of
reasonableness
may
attach.
so
that
attaches
only
to
this
guideline
range.
and
that
makes
the
risk
of
reversal
higher
if
you
--
if
you
go
outside
the
guidelines.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
well,
i
think
that
they
are
fairly
low
--
i
don't
know
the
precise
statistics
--
i
believe
they're
low
for
defendant
appeals.
but
partly
you're
worried
about
here
is
--
is
the
government
going
to
appeal.
they
don't
appeal
very
often,
but
they
have
a
high
rate
of--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--i
believe
the
--
yes,
it
may
be
--
i
don't
know.
it's
not
a
great
number,
but
they
prevail
when
they
do.
and
it
--
and
it
does
have
some
effect,
which
i
think
the
court--
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
--the
government
tends
to
prevail
when
it
brings.
but,
you
know,
that's
a
potential
deterrent
effect.
but
even
the
fact
of
substantive
reasonableness
review,
you
have
to
have
reasons,
you
have
to
be
able
to
justify
your
deviations.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
i'm
not
sure.
i
haven't
reviewed
all
those
cases,
your
honor.
so
the
--
returning
to
the
question
of
this
particular
sentencing,
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
rule
on
a
narrower
ground
based
on
non-overlapping
ranges,
which
is
not
going
to
be
particularly
common,
here
there's
unquestionably
a
significant
risk.
you
have
a
defendant
who
prior
to
this
course
of
conduct
had
lived
an
exemplary
life.
his
threshold
--
his
--
the
loss
in
his
case
barely
crawled
into
the
2.5
million
to
5
million.
it
was
about
40,000
over
2.5
million.
and
the
district
court
sentenced
at
the
bottom
of
the
guidelines
range,
agreeing
with
the
policy
of
increasing
sentences
with
the
amount
of
loss.
that
same
policy
was
present,
but
not
the
same
level
of
increase,
in
the
1998
guidelines.
so
i
think
there's
clearly,
as
applied
to
his
sentence,
the
significant
risk
he
would
not
have
gotten
70
months,
which
would
have
been
an
upward
variance
of
50
--
of
50
percent
from
the
old
guidelines
range.
but
i
think
if
the
court
does
wish
to
consider
the
broader
ruling,
i
think
it's
also
true
that
it
is
inherent
in
this
system,
in
the
rita
and
gall
framework,
which
provide
for
a
mandatory
benchmark,
which
provide
for
the
substantive
reasonableness
review,
that
you're
going
to
have
some
significant
risk
of
some
increased
quantum
of
punishment
as
a
result
of
this
change
in
law.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
your
honor,
there
are
two
things
you
could
mean
when
you
use
the
word
“
anchor
”.
one,
you
could
mean
that
there's
some
sort
of
legal
anchor,
and
we
think
that
the
court's
decisions
that
i've
just
described,
in
particular,
the
court's
repeated
insistence
that
district
courts
cannot
presume
a
guidelines
range
to
be
reasonable,
means
the
district
courts
cannot
treat
them
as
a
legal
anchor.
second,
you
might
be
suggesting
that
they
serve
as
some
sort
of
psychological
anchor.
that's
not
a
concern
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
the
ex
post
facto
clause
doesn't
guarantee
defendants
a
right
to
a
judge
who
has
a
particular
sentencing
philosophy.
mr.
stephen
b.
kinnaird
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
five
quick
points.
first,
the
government
says
this
must
be
an
overt
legal
restraint
to
be
within
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
this
court
has
repeatedly,
in
weaver
and
other
cases,
said
it's
the
effect
of
the
change
of
law,
not
its
form,
that
matters
for
ex
post
facto
purposes,
the
effect
on
punishment.
and
what
this
revision
and
amendment
of
the
mandatory
benchmark
did
was
to
alter
the
legal
framework
in
a
way
that
channelled
and
redefined
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
the
direction
of
greater
punishment.
secondly,
what
range
is
the
--
is
the
mandatory
benchmark
under
the
statute
matters
greatly,
as
justice
kennedy
alluded
to,
to
appellate
review
for
substantive
reasonableness.
you
have
--
it's
the
key
factor
in
determining
whether
a
sentence
is
reasonable,
and
it's
the
standard
to
which
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
may
attach.
third,
as
far
as
the
record,
there's
--
there's
no
analysis
in
the
record
of
the
1998
guidelines
other
than
to
--
to
set
them
aside.
and
--
and
what
you
have
to
have
under
the
constitution
is,
he
has
to
actually
apply
those
as
the
statute
required
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
as
the
mandatory
benchmark.
instead,
he's
quite
clear,
he's
applying
the
'98
guidelines.
he's
deferring
to
the
--
to
the
policy
judgments
there,
and
to
the
loss
calculations.
so
it
had
a
clear
substantive
effect
on
his
risk
of
greater
punishment.
the
post-booker
report
does
have
those
line
--
those
charts
that
show
that
for
all
offenses
and
for
fraud
offenses,
when
the
guidelines'
minimum
goes
up,
the
average
sentences
go
up,
and
that's
a
very
compelling
point
of
evidence.
and
finally,
i
would
point
out
here
that
one
of
the
amendments
here
was
actually
a
response
of
the
commission
to
a
congressional
directive
in
the
wake
of
the
enron
scandal
and
the
sarbanes-oxley
act,
where
there
was
great
public
and
legislative
outrage
over
light
fraud
sentences,
to
reconsider
the
fraud
guidelines.
and
that
puts
this
in
the
core
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
that
it
violates
fundamental
notions
of
retroactivity
for
a
legislature
to
be
able
to
alter
the
law
of
punishment
after
the
offense.
thank
you.
