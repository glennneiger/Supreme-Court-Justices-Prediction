justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
gone
back
to
calder
v.
bull.
and
calder
v.
bull,
which
this
court
refers
to
all
the
time
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
has
four
categories
and
the
only
one
that
fits
this
case
is
a
law
that
changes
the
punishment--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
inflicts
a
greater
punishment
than
the
law
annexed
to
the
crime
when
committed.
so
whatever
these
other
hypotheticals
are,
they
do
not
involve
--
they
are
not
laws
that
change
the
punishment.
but
yours
is
a
law
that
changes
the
punishment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wouldn't
concede
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
isn't,
but
that
i
think
is
an
undecided
question
at
best.
if
you
won
the
case
on
that
ground,
i
would
say
that
what
the
guidelines
and
the
sentencing
commission
are
best
at,
gathering
information
from
across
the
country
and
saying
a
typical
person
who
commits
this
crime
in
a
typical
way
should
be
sentenced
to
the
typical
range
that
applies,
let's
say
18
to
24
months.
that
would
be
down
the
drain.
and
i
think
that
rita,
in
fact,
and
the
other
cases
have
at
the
very
most
left
open
and
maybe
decided
against
you
the
question
of
when
a
court
of
appeals
gets
the
sentence
from
a
judge
who
does
not
apply
the
guideline
because
he
doesn't
like
the
policy
judgment.
that's
a
different
matter
from
when
he
applies
it
and
when
he
thinks
he
shouldn't
apply
it
because
the
person
in
front
of
him
doesn't
meet
the
policy
conditions.
those
are
different.
the
commission
has
the
expertise
in
the
first,
the
judge
in
the
second.
and
so
there
is
at
least
a
question
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
should
give
more
leeway
to
the
guidelines
in
the
first
and
more
leeway
to
the
judge
in
the
second.
now,
i
think
rita
is
consistent
with
that,
and
i
think
every
opinion
we
have
written
is
consistent
with
that.
and
i'd
hate
to
see
that
suddenly
decided
and
changed
in
a
way
i
think
is
inappropriate
in
this
case.
so
have
you
all
thought
that
through?
and
is
the
position
of
the
government
now
that
we
think
the
guidelines,
even
if
it's
a
policy
matter
that
they
have
gathered
evidence
on,
are
entitled
to
nothing
if
they
run
across
a
district
judge
who
happens
to
think,
though
he
was
an
outlier,
that
the
outliers
were
right
as
a
matter
of
policy,
which
of
course
will
always
be
true.
every
judge
who
is
an
outlier
thinks
the
outliers
are
right.
otherwise
why
would
he
do
it?
you
see?
now,
i
didn't
know
that
issue
was
in
this
case
and
that
changes
the
case
dramatically
for
me.
and
i
thought
we
could
decide
this
just
on
the
ground
that
this
is
a
law
that
changes
punishment.
it's
a
law.
it's
a
regulation.
and
justice
scalia
i
thought
was
completely
right.
the
question
is
whether
it
inflicts
greater
punishment.
and
there
is
a
test
on
that
and
the
controlling
inquiry
is
whether
retroactive
application
of
a
change
in
a
law
that
affects
punishment
created
a
sufficient
risk
of
increasing
the
measure
of
punishment
attached.
all
right?
and
that's
--
that's
what
i
thought
the
framework
of
law
was
in
this
case.
now,
this
is
sort
of
tough
for
you
on
oral
argument
because
i'm
just,
perhaps,
bringing
it
all
up
to
get
it
all
out
there
and
see
what
you
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
--
i
see
now
where
you're
going.
what
i
think
you're
saying
is
whatever
the
sentence
is
--
i
am
the
judge,
i
read
the
guidelines.
now,
i
may
think
that
i
am
more
likely
to
get
reversed
if
i
substitute
a
different
view
than
the
commission
had
on
a
matter
of
policy.
that's
all
true.
but
still,
i
don't
have
to
do
it.
no
matter
what
it
is,
i
can
not
use
the
guidelines.
and
if
i
get
reversed
on
other
grounds
or
the
sentence
is
not
reasonable,
da,
da,
da,
da,
da.
but
there's
no
legal
binding
nature
there.
that's
your
point,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
exactly
your
point--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
now
i
can
narrow
what
the
question
i
think
is.
