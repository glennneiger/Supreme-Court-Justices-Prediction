but
isn't
the
important
point,
mr.
kinnaird,
that
there's
a
presumption
of
correctness
that
attaches
to
guidelines
sentences
on
appeal--
justice
elena
kagan
--that
does
not
attach
to
non-guidelines
sentences?
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
this
is,
one
would
think,
great
legal
consequence.
justice
elena
kagan
but
what
that
suggests
is
that
the
guidelines
serve
as
an
anchor
and
are
supposed
to
serve
as
an
anchor,
and
that
the
reason
why
the
miscalculation
is
error
is
because
you've
picked
the
wrong
anchor
and
that's
going
to
affect
or
--
or
has
a
significant
likelihood
of
affecting
your
ultimate
decision.
and
isn't
that
really
what
we've
suggested
is
the
way
the
guidelines
ought
to
work,
and
the
way
you
think
the
guidelines
ought
to
work,
that
it
serves
as
an
anchor
for
sentencing
decisions.
yes,
you
can
vary,
you
can
deviate,
but
it's
your
anchor.
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
i'm
saying
more
than
it's
all
in
your
head.
i
think
i'm
saying
you
start
in
a
particular
place,
you
have
to
get
the
particular
place
right.
the
appellate
court
looks
at
the
particular
place
that
you've
started
and
if
you
--
if
you've
ended
up
there,
has
to
grant
a
presumption
of
reasonableness.
but
the
rules
are
all
geared
towards
saying,
yes,
you
can
deviate,
but
you
have
to
understand
that
there's
--
that
--
deviation
requires
some
kind
of
thought
process
and
some
kind
of
reason.
otherwise,
this
is
where
you
should
be.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
feigin,
you're
sounding
awfully
like
according
deference
to
the
guidelines
counts
as
reversible
error.
justice
elena
kagan
but
surely,
you
do
not
want
judges
living
in
a
world
where
they
think
that
they
cannot
give
deference
to
the
guidelines;
isn't
that
right?
you
want
them
to
give
appropriate
deference
to
the
guidelines;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
feigin,
take
this
example.
let's
suppose
that
there's
a
crime
and
the
punishment
for
crime
is
5
years
to
life,
all
right?
now,
congress
passes
a
statute
and
it
says,
no,
we
think
this
crime
now
is
much
more
important
than
we
used
to,
now
it's
25
years
to
life,
right?
a
--
a
person
commits
the
offense
prior
to
that
change.
absolutely
obvious
case,
right,
that
you
have
to
apply
the
--
the
5
years
to
life,
right?
obvious,
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
now,
the
sentencing
commission
does
what
the
sentencing
commission
always
does
when
there
is
a
legislative
change
like
this.
it
says,
well,
we
have
this
guidelines
that
assumes
5
years
to
life.
we
have
to
change
our
guidelines
because
now
it's
25
years
to
life.
and
it
passes
a
guideline
amendment
which
completely
conforms
to
the
legislative
amendment.
but
you're
saying,
no,
the
25-year-to-life
guideline
is
the
appropriate
one
to
implement,
even
though
the
5-year
statute
is
the
appropriate
one
to
implement
--
is
the
appropriate
one
to
give
effect
to.
can
that
possibly
be
right?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
more
goes
into
it
than
empirics.
but
there's
this
unbelievable
chart
really
in
one
of
the
green
briefs
about
--
you
know,
where
there's
one
line
which
is
what
happens
to
the
guidelines
and
there's
this
other
line
which
is
what
happens
to
the
sentence,
and
they
follow
each
other
identically,
exactly.
you
can't
get
a
chart
that
looks
better
from
this
than
--
from
mr.
kinnaird's
point
of
view.
