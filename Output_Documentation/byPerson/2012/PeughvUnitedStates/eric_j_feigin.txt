mr.
eric
j.
feigin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
made
clear
in
miller
v.
florida
that
an
ex
post
facto
law
has
to
change,
quote,
"the
legal
consequences
of
a
prior
act.
"
a
guidelines
amendment
doesn't
do
that.
a
district
court
has
the
same
authority
and
the
same--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
we
--
we
opposed
certiorari
largely
on
that
ground.
we
don't
think
the
guidelines
impose
a
constraint
on
a
district
court's
exercise
of
sentencing
discretion.
that
is,
if
a
judge
decides
that
a
guidelines
range
that
the
commission
has
suggested
at
some
other
time
suggests
a
more
appropriate
sentence
or
if
the
judge
believes
that
some
sentence
that's
unrelated
to
any
guidelines
range
is
the
most
appropriate
sentence,
the
judge
has
discretion
to
impose
that
sentence.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
i
freely
believe
that
the
guidelines
are
very
influential
to
many
district
judges
and
district
judges
often
agree
with
the
guidelines.
they
often
impose
sentences
within
the
guidelines
range
or
close
to
the
guidelines
range.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
the
government
changed
its
position
in
response
to
this
court's
decisions
in
gall,
kimbrough
and
irizarry,
because
before
those
decisions
came
out,
there
was
an
argument
that
the
guidelines
still
imposed
some
substantive
legal
constraint
on
a
district
court's
sentencing
discretion.
after
gall,
kimbrough
and
irizarry,
after
nelson
and
spears,
that
argument
no
longer
exists.
rita
makes
clear
that
district
courts
cannot
presume
a
guidelines
range
to
be
reasonable.
irizarry
makes
clear
that
a
defendant
is
constitutionally
on
notice
that
he
can
get
sentenced
anywhere
within
the
statutory
range,
and
gall
makes
clear
that
courts
of
appeals
should
apply
the
same
deferential
standard
of
review
to
every
sentence
regardless
whether
it
falls
within
the
guidelines
range,
just
outside
the
guidelines
range,
or
far
outside
the
guidelines
range.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
i
think
rita
actually
supports
our
position,
not
petitioner's.
the
court
made
clear
in
rita
that
the
presumption
of
reasonableness
on
appeal
that
this
--
that
courts
of
appeals
can
choose
to
apply,
but
need
not,
has
no
legal
effect.
rather,
it
reflects
the
commonsense
proposition
that
when
the
commission
recommends
a
particular
sentencing
range
as
to
a
particular
class
of
defendants
and
the
district
court,
in
its
discretion,
actually
imposes
the
sentence
within
that
range,
that
the
sentence
is
likely
to
be
reasonable.
the
entire
premise
behind
the
presumption
of
reasonableness
that
was
adopted
in
rita
is
that
district
courts
are
in
fact
exercising
their
discretion
when
they
impose
sentences,
and
that's
the
same
premise
on
which
we'd
ask
you
to
decide
this
case.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
it's
very
clear
from
3553(a)(4)
that
congress
wants
district
courts
to
start
with
the
right
mix
of
information,
which
includes
the
most
up-to-date
recommendation
of
the
sentencing
commission.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
it
has
importance,
your
honor,
and
as
i've
said
before,
they
can
be
very
influential
to
judges,
but
the
reason
why
it's
an
error
to
miscalculate
the
guidelines
is
not
because
the
guidelines
impose
any
substantive
constraint
on
the
district
court's
discretion.
after
reversal
for
miscalculating
the
guidelines,
the
judge
is
free
to
impose
the
same
sentence
anyway,
and
there's
no
constraint
on
the
judge's
discretion
that
arises
from
the
guidelines
frame.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
the
court
made
clear
in
pepper
two
terms
ago
that
the
district
court's
overarching
legal
duty
is
to
impose
a
sentence
sufficient
but
not
greater
than
necessary
to
meet
the
statutory
purposes
of
sentencing
in
section
3553(a)(2).
the
guidelines
are
one
of
several
factors
that
inform
the
district
court's
exercise
of
discretion.
if
a
district
court
treats
the
guidelines
as
some
sort
of
legal
constraint
this
court's
decisions
say
it
can't
be
treated
as,
that
would
be
statutory
error.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
let
me
start
at
the
end
there,
justice
breyer.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
well,
your
honor,
justice
breyer,
beginning
with
what
you
said
at
the
end
there,
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
untether
the
significant
risk
test
from
the
requirement
that
there
be
an
ex
post
facto
law.
that
is,
there
has
to
be
a
significant
legal
risk,
a
risk
that
is
traceable
to
some
sort
of
change
in
the
decisionmaker's
authority
with
respect
to
sentencing,
and
we
don't
have
that
here.
a
district
court
has
the
same
authority
and
the
same
obligation
to
impose
an
appropriate
sentence
the
day
after
the
guidelines
are
amended
as
the
judge
had
the
day
before
the
guidelines
are
amended.
and
any
judge
who
forgets
that
is
going
to
be
committing
statutory
error,
and
the
sentence
could
be
reversed
on
appeal
for
violating
the
booker
remedy.
and
that's--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
as
i've
explained,
the
reason
why
courts
--
the
only
way
in
which
courts
of
appeals
can
apply
a
different
standard
of
review
to
a
sentence,
depending
on
where
it
falls
in
the
guidelines
range,
is
the
presumption
of
reasonableness
the
court
recognized
in
rita.
and
i
think
rita
makes
quite
clear
that
that
is
a
practical
presumption.
that
is,
it
simply
acknowledges
the
commonsense
proposition
that
when
a
district
court
exercising
its
discretion
reaches
a
judgment
that
accords
with
the
commission's
expertise,
it's
likely
that
sentence
is
reasonable.
i
don't
think--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
it
would
depend
on
the
individual
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
might
say
that
it's
substantively
unreasonable
because
it's
a
very,
very
low
sentence
even
in
comparison
to
the
statute.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
and,
your
honor,
in
that
case,
it
is
possible
a
court
of
appeals
would
decide
that
that
is
substantively
unreasonable.
it's
possible
a
court
of
appeals
might
reference
the
guidelines.
but
the
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
would
find
it
substantively
unreasonable
is
because
as
a
whole
it
is
substantively
unreasonable
and
not
because
it
varies
too
far
from
the
guidelines.
i
also
want
to
emphasize--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
complaints
that
petitioner
could
be
making
about
his
particular
sentencing.
one
could
be
that
he
thinks
the
judge
treated
the
guidelines
too
deferentially
as
a
legal
matter.
and
if
that's
what
he
believes,
his
remedy
is
a
claim
of
statutory
error
under
booker.
he's
never
made
that
claim.
the
other
claim--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--and
whichever
set
of
guidelines
the
district
court
started
with,
it
had
discretion
and
in
fact
the
obligation
to
impose
the
appropriate
sentence
under
3553(a).
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
petitioner
argued
in
this
case
that
the
former
guidelines
range
suggested
a
more
appropriate
sentence
than
the
2009
guidelines
range.
the
district
court
considered
that
argument
and
it
rejected
it.
and
defendants
are
always
free
to
raise
that
argument.
if
i
could
go
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
child
pornography
hypothetical--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--well,
your
honor,
on
the
record,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
full
sentencing
transcript,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
see
that
one
of
the
questions
the
judge
had
to
answer
was
which
set
of
guidelines
were
provided
--
were
the
set
of
guidelines
that
he
had
to
calculate
under
3553(a)(4)(a)(2).
and
then
there
was
a
separate
section
in
which
he
considered
the
argument
that
the
2009
guidelines
were
too
harsh.
if
you
look
at
the
sentencing
memorandum
that
petitioner
filed
in
this
case,
it
argued
that
the
increase
in
loss
amounts
in
the
fraud
guidelines
was
too
harsh,
that
judges
often
impose
sentences
that
are
the
guidelines,
and
the
district
court
should
do
so
here.
the
district
court
considered
that
argument
and
rejected
that.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
justice
ginsburg,
it's
--
as
the
court
considers
these
as
two
separate
questions,
one
is
which
is
the
set
of
guidelines
i'm
required
to
calculate
under
section
3553(a),
and
second,
having
calculated
those
guidelines,
what
sentence
should
i
impose,
with
the
guidelines
as
one
of
the
factors
that
the
court
consider.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
i'm
saying
treating
the
guidelines
as
some
sort
of
legal
constraint
on
the
district
court's
sentencing
discretion
is
reversible
error.
now,
if
the
district
court
chooses
in
its
own
discretion
to
give
weight
to
the
guidelines,
that's
within
the
realm
of
choice
that
3553(a)
provides.
there
are
many
circumstances--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and,
justice
kagan--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
we
want
them
to
find
the
guidelines
persuasive
and
influential.
we
recognize
that
under
this
court's
decisions,
they
cannot
treat
the
guidelines
as
a
legal
constraint
on
their
sentencing
discretion.
if
a
judge
follows
the
guidelines,
that's
because
the
judge
is
exercising
its
discretion
to
decide
that
a
guidelines
range
sentence
is
appropriate
in
that
particular
case.
now,
there
are
many
instances
in
which
judges
choose
not
to
do
that.
so,
for
example,
justice
sotomayor
brought
up
child
pornography.
in
fiscal
year
2012,
a
defendant
for
a
non-production
child
pornography
offense,
that
is,
receipt
or
possession
of
child
pornography,
was
substantially
more
likely
to
get
a
nongovernment-sponsored
below-range
sentence
than
to
get
a
within-range
sentence;
48.4
percent
nongovernment-sponsored
below-range,
32.7
percent
within
range.
if
we
want
to
talk
about
fraud
for
a
minute,
which
is
what
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
charged
with,
if
you
look
at
page
67
of
the
commission's
post-booker
report,
and
i'd
encourage
the
court
to
read
that
report
in
full,
because
it
makes
very
clear
the
variations
in
sentencing
practices
among
--
depending
on
the
crime,
depending
on
the
particular
circuit,
depending
on
the
particular
district,
and
even
depending
on
the
particular
judge.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
so,
your
honor,
i
think
the
post-booker
report
refutes
that
in
the
respect
i
just
suggested.
it
says
that
there
are
actually
very
different
sentencing
practices,
depending
on
the
particular
crime,
depending
on
the
particular
judge.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
the
commission
says
many
things
in
its
report.
one
of
the
things
it
says
is
that
in
the
aggregate,
guidelines
do
--
actual
sentences
do
tend
to
track
the
guidelines.
but
if
you
look
beyond
that
one
aggregate
statistic
and
you
start
to
look
at
the
variations
in
sentencing
practices
in
courts
across
the
nation
that
vary
not
only
by
judge
but
by
guideline,
you
see
that
the
system
is
actually
operating
the
way
you'd
expect
to--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--that's
exactly
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i'd
like
to
add
two
--
two
observations
to
that,
first
of
which
is,
as
an
empirical
matter,
it
is
extremely
unlikely
for
a
sentence
to
get
reversed
on
substantive
reasonableness
grounds.
the
commission's
post-booker
report
--
and
i'm
talking
about
the
one
that
they
just
issued
a
few
weeks
ago
that's
cited
in
the
reply
brief
--
states
that
substantive
unreasonableness
reversals
are
very
rare.
petitioner,
on
page
30
of
his
brief,
cites
a
database
that
contains
38
such
reversals
post
gall.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
and
the
second
point
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
that
is
that
i
don't
think
this
court
should
assume
that
district
courts
are
actually
going
to
change
what
sentences
they
impose
and
not
impose
the
sentence
they
believe
is
sufficient,
but
no
greater
than
necessary
to
meet
the
purposes
of
sentencing
just
because
they--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--your
honor,
i
absolutely--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
absolutely
do
not
want
you
to
leave
the
bench
with
the
impression
that
the
guidelines
are
unimportant.
i
want
you
to
leave
the
bench
with
the
impression
that
the
guidelines
don't
impose
any
legal
constraint
on
a
judge's
exercise
of
discretion.
different
judges
--
not
only
does
it
vary
by
guideline,
but--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--yes.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
i
think
i'm
saying
something
slightly
different.
i
think
under
3553(a),
the
court
would
calculate
the
current
guidelines.
now,
the
defendant
would
have
a
very
good
argument
in
that
case
that
the
current
guidelines
range
would
simply
not
be
appropriate
for
him,
and
i
think
a
district
court
would
do
well
to
listen
to
that
argument
in
that
particular
case
if
it
thought
that
the
sentences
that
the
new
guidelines
range
was
suggesting
were
out
of
whack
with
the
statute
at
the
time
the
offense
was
committed.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i
believe
it's
only
for
revisions
that
lower--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--and,
your
honor,
getting
back
to
how
the
advisory
guidelines
are
working
in
practice
for
a
minute,
which
again
is
i
don't
think
what
this
--
what
the
focus
should
be.
the
focus
should
be
on
whether
there's
actually
been
a
change
in
the
law
that
either
increases
or
decreases
a
sentencer's
discretion.
if
you
imagine
two
states,
for
example,
each
of
which
had
exactly
the
same
advisory
guidelines
system
that
the
federal
government
has,
and
in
one
of
them
judges
are,
you
know,
tend
to
find
the
guidelines
very
persuasive,
they
sentence
within
the
guidelines
70
percent
of
the
time.
in
the
other
one,
judges
exercising
their
discretion
don't
find
the
guidelines
very
persuasive
and
they
sentence
within
the
guidelines
10
percent
of
the
time.
i
don't
think
it
makes
sense
that
under
the
exact
same
legal
regime
an
amendment
to
the
guidelines
in
one
state
would
be
an
ex
post
facto
law
and
an
amendment
to
the
guidelines
in
the
other
state
wouldn't
be
an
ex
post
facto
law.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
they
are
a
factor.
they're
a
factor
under
3553(a).
they're
a
factor
that
the
district
court
has
to
consider.
but
they
don't
themselves
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
constrain
the
district
court's
exercise
of
discretion.
a
district
court
can
decide
that
--
not
to
impose
a
guidelines
sentence.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say
they
define
the
discretion
either.
i
think
they
are
a
recommendation
and
information
that
informs
the
exercise
of
discretion--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i'm
happy
to
be,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i
think
it
might
well
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
your
honor,
because
in
that
case
you
have
something
we
don't
have
here,
which
is
that
the
decisionmaker
has
less
discretion
than--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--the
reason
--
the
reason
i
said
“
might
well
”
is
i
think
at
that
point
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
the
significance
of
the
increase
or
decrease
in
the
sentencer's
authority,
and
decide
whether
that
was
a
significant
enough
increase
or
decrease
to
trigger
the--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--the
ex
post
facto
clause.
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
i
think
that's
where
the
significant
risk
test
comes
in.
and
under
the
significant
risk
test,
you
can
either
see
whether
it
facially
has
that
effect
--
we
know
that's
not
true
of
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
because
the
court's
made
clear
they
don't
impose
any
legal
constraints,
or
you
could
see
whether
it
has
that
effect
as
applied
under
garner.
we
know
that--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--i
think
it's
fundamental
--
the
decision
in
garner
doesn't
precisely
describe
exactly
how
the
significant
risk
inquiry
works.
i
think
it
is
fundamentally
a
legal
inquiry,
because
the
bottom-line
question
the
court's
always
trying
to
answer
is
whether
there
has
been
an
ex
post
facto
law.
and
i
think,
to
the
extent
it's
okay
to
look
at
empirical
data
--
and
i
don't
think
the
court
in
garner
expressly
says
that
that's
the
kind
of
data
it
was
contemplating
--
it
would
be
to
inform
how
the
legal
framework
actually
operates
in
practice.
and
if
the
court
found
it
necessary
to
look
at
that
here,
in
--
the
post-booker
report
makes
clear
that
sentencing
practices
vary
over
the
districts,
over
the
circuits,
and
with
respect
to
particular
guidelines.
so
justice
alito
brought
up
the
example
of
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
we
don't
have
to
look
any
further
than
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
where
petitioner
was
sentenced
here,
where
the
latest
2012
statistics
that
came
out
on
friday
show
that
a
defendant
actually
has
a
slightly
higher
probability,
very
slightly
higher
probability,
of
getting
a
non-government-sponsored
below-range
sentence
than
of
getting
a
sentence
within
the
guidelines
range.
i
think
all
these
variances
show
two
things.
one,
they
show
that
the
system
is
working
exactly
as
you'd
expect
an
advisory
system
to
work.
and
two,
i
think
they
show
that
some
sort
of
narrow
focus
on
empirical
data,
which
is
what
you
are
left
with
once
you
divorce
the
ex
post
facto
inquiry
from
a
change
in
law,
is
inherently
unworkable.
you
have
to--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--so
let
me
say
two
things
in
response
to
that,
your
honor.
if
you
look
in
the
post-booker
report,
they
have
charts
like
that
that
are
broken
down
by
offense--
mr.
eric
j.
feigin
--if
you
look
at
fraud
and
you
look
at
child
pornography,
they
deviate
when
they
go
in
--
when
the
guidelines'
suggestion
goes
up,
the
sentences
don't
go
up
in
accordance
with
that
at
the
same
level
of
the
chart
you
are
looking
at.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
