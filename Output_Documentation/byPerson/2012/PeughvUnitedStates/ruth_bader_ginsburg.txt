your
real
formula
is
significantly
increased
the
risk
of
perform
--
of
prolonging
the
defendant's
incarceration.
that's
the
standard
you
would
like
us--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
is
--
is
the
heart
of
your
argument
that
there
really
isn't
much
difference
at
all
in
what
district
judges
are
doing
now
that
the
guidelines
are
discretionary
than
what
they
did
when
they
were
mandatory,
that
is,
most
of
them
will
start
with
and
stop
with
the
guidelines.
i
think
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
was
in
the
--
that
florida
case
was
the
mandatory,
almost
mandatory
guideline,
and
i
think
our
starting
point
is
--
your
starting
point,
too
--
is
that
when
the
guidelines
were
mandatory
it
was
ex
post
facto
because
our
decision
in
the
florida
case
said
it
was.
is
this
sufficiently
different
now
that
the
guidelines
are
advisory
rather
than
mandatory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
is
a
change
--
your
position
is
--
is
a
change,
at
least
in
the
position
that
the
government
took
in
--
in
the
seventh
circuit
case
that
started
all
this.
the
government
confessed
error.
the
government
said
the
district
judge
should
have
used
the
guidelines
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
the
offense
was
committed,
and
the
government
came
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
confessed
error.
so
there
was
not
even
an
argument
until
the
seventh
circuit
and
judge
posner
wrote
the
opinion
that
included
all
the
hypotheticals
that
--
that
were
aired
earlier
about
the
victim
impact
statement
and
all
of
those
are
in
that
opinion.
so
it
was
only
after
--
after
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
that
the
government
changed
its
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
guidelines
range
gets
a
presumption
of
reasonableness
at
the
appellate
level.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
disagree
with
--
getting
back
to
what
this
case
is
about,
the
d.c.
circuit,
in
opposition
to
the
seventh
circuit
said:
"it
is
enough
that
using
the
new
guideline
created
a
substantial
risk
that
the
defendant's
sentence
was
more
severe
that
it
would
have
been
if
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
crime
were
used.
"
and
it
said,
"there
is
no
doubt
that
this
case
fits
that
description.
"
"there
was
quite
a
substantial
risk
that
the
elevated
guidelines
would
result
in
a
more
severe
sentence.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he's
saying
that
--
the
question
is
which
guidelines
in
this
case?
and
he's
saying
it's
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
he
committed
the
crime.
we
are
not
dealing
with
other
--
i
mean,
it's
quite
a
simple
choice.
is
it
--
does
the
court
start
with
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed
or
does
it
start
with
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
of
sentencing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
we
know
that
this
district
judge,
he
didn't
want
to
get
into
any
philosophical
things
about
what
was
better
or
what
was
worse.
he
said,
i
want
to
follow
the
guidelines.
so
the
question
for
him
was
only
which
guideline.
he
got
his
answer
from
the
seventh
circuit.
they
said
the
guidelines
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
a
judge
in
the
d.c.
district
court
will
get
the
other
answer,
the
guidelines
in
effect
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
the
judge
thought
that
the
one
guideline
was
better
than
the
other.
he
specifically
said
he
wasn't
interested
in
that
question.
the
question
was
which
guideline
does
he
follow.
what
does
he
start
with?
and
you
recognize
that
you
do
start
with
the
guidelines.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
court
was
following
orders.
he
was
following
the
seventh
circuit.
the
seventh
circuit
had
said:
you
start
with
the
higher
guidelines.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
judge
randolph
wrong
when
he
said,
quoting
the
sentencing
commission,
that
within-guidelines
range,
even
after
booker,
is
the
standard?
indeed,
the
actual
impact
of
booker
on
sentencing
has
been
minor,
and
for
that
minor,
he
cites
the
sentencing
commission.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
statement
comes
from
final
report
on
the
impact
of
the
united
states
v.
booker
on
federal
sentencing.
