justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let's
say
you
prevail
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
resentencing.
is
there
anything
that
would
prevent
the
district
court
from
saying,
you
know,
before
the
promulgation
of
the
new
guidelines,
i
thought
the
range
in
the
old
guidelines
was
about
right
for
this
offense.
but
now
that
i've
seen
the
new
guidelines,
i
think
that
those
really
fit
best
under
the
factors
that
i
have
to
consider
under
the
statute
in
determining
the
correct
sentence,
so
i'm
going
to
reimpose
exactly
the
same
sentence.
not
because
it's
required
by
the
guidelines,
in
fact,
i'm
going
to
go
outside
the
guidelines.
i
just
think,
with
the
enlightenment
that
the
new
guidelines
have
provided
me,
that
that's
the
best
sentence.
would
that
be
--
would
there
be
an
ex
post
facto
problem
there?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
statistics
showed
that
nationwide
only,
let's
say,
25
percent
of
defendants
were
being
sentenced
within
the
guideline
range;
would
that
change
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
there's
a
fair
chance
that
as
time
goes
by--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--we're
going
to
see
fewer
and
fewer
sentences
within
the
guidelines.
as
judges
who
began
their
careers
during
the
guidelines,
the
mandatory
guidelines
era,
leave
the
bench,
new
judges
come
in
who
never
had
to
deal
with
the
mandatory
guidelines,
i
think
we're
going
to
see
fewer
and
fewer
guidelines
sentences.
and
--
and
the
percentages
in
some
districts
are
--
are
really
quite
striking.
i'm
told
that
in
the
southern
district
--
or
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
now,
only
30
percent
of
the
defendants
receive
within-guidelines
sentences.
so--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
when
i
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
we
thought
it
was
our
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
district
courts
were
complying
with
the
sentencing
reform
act.
that
might
not
have
been
true
across
the
river,
but--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--let's
say
this
case
comes
back
in
20
years
and
the
statistics
show
that
only
a
--
a
distinct
minority
of
defendants
are
being
sentenced
within
the
guidelines;
would
the
case
come
out
differently?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
know
what
the
statistics
are
as
to
the
number
of
below-guidelines
sentences
each
year
that
are
reversed
by
the
courts
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
they
are
not
reasonable?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
in
the
single
digits.
