justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
state
legislature
articulates
clearly
and
expresses
affirmatively
that
it
wants
municipalities
to
share
the
state's
antitrust
immunity,
is
that
sufficient,
or
is
there
a
degree
of
specificity
that's
necessary
as
to
the
particular
anticompetitive
conduct
that
the
state
wants
to
cover?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that's
what's
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
want
to
take
up
your
rebuttal
time,
but
i
don't
see
how
that's
consistent
with
your
answer
to
justice
kagan
about
a
grant
of
discretionary
authority.
