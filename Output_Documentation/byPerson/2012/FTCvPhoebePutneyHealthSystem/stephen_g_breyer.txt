justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
about
the
other?
the
next
line
that
they
give
is
they
give
to
the
hospital
authority
the
power
to
acquire
and
operate
projects
and
the
power
to
form
and
operate
one
or
more
networks
of
hospitals,
physicians
and
other
health
care
providers.
now,
as
i
read
that,
it
certainly
includes
the
rather
specific
power
of
acquiring
a
hospital.
and
having
read
that
--
not
just
something
you
might
see
in
general
motors'
charter.
and
that's
the
language
of
the
grant
of
power.
now,
i
want
to
know
what
you
want
us
to
do,
because
in
my
mind,
reading
this,
it's
a
statute
that
provides
for
regulation,
price
regulation
of
hospitals.
and
you
say
--
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
thought
of
one
way
in
which
that
could
be;
i
can
think
of
100,
that
you
could
have
prices
that
are
different
from
those
set
by
a
free
market.
so
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
sets
--
i
start
from.
now,
what
is
it
--
i
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
original
question.
what
is
it
you
want
us
to
say?
even
though
this
--
this
statute
is
immune,
does
grant
immunity
from
attack
on
a
basis
of
cost
and
price
regulation,
it
is
not
immune
in
respect
to
mergers,
okay?
i
can,
unfortunately,
think
of
about
50
examples
where
a
merger
might
be
anticompetitive
and
yet
it
would
lead
to
lower
prices.
and
the
department
of
justice
might
attack
it,
but
this
statute,
and
that's
what's
bothering
me,
seems
to
want
to
further
that
kind
of
thing.
that's
where
i
am,
and
i'm
not
at
all
decided.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
think
i
know
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
are
not
understanding
my
question,
i
guess.
you
have
to
take
as
a
given
that,
even
though
what
you
say
is
true,
i
would
find
that
this
statute
clearly
prohibits
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
pricing
decisions.
that's
the
job
of
the
authority.
now,
if
i
start
with
that,
then
you
will
say,
okay,
i
have
to
decide
against
you.
or
you
might
say,
even
so
i
win,
because
mergers
are
different.
now,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
ask
you,
why
are
they
different?
after
all,
we
have,
one,
the
specific
language
i
read;
and,
two,
i
can
think
of
examples
where
a
merger
would
be
anticompetitive
under
the
doj
and
your
ftc
rules--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
yet
probably
would
further
the
purposes
of
the
statute
by
lowering
the
cost.
do
you
think
that's
the
null
set?
i
don't
think
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
does
the
words
mean,
"to
form
and
operate
one
or
more
major
networks
of
hospitals?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
follow
the
words
"to
acquire
and
operate
projects,
defined
to
include
hospitals?
"
so
what
about
those
words?
why
aren't
they
good
enough?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
looking
at
section
30
--
well,
where
are
we?
31-7-75(3).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
falls
within
the
words
“
to
acquire
and
operate
projects
”.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
can't
--
in
other
words,
the
two
hospitals
in
the
town,
when
they
say
the
price
here,
you
shall
see
that
the
price
is
not
higher
than
38
cents,
whatever,
and
would
you
please
get
together
and
be
certain
that
you
have
similar
terms
and
you
have
similar
agreements
and
similar
prices
there,
we
don't
want
either
of
you
to
be
higher,
you
would
then
proceed
against
them
for
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
would
you
also
do
the
same
if
the
electricity
regulator
in
any
state
or
telephone,
a
local
telephone
regulator--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
gas
pipeline
regulator
--
what
they
did
is
the
same
thing;
they
said,
our
prices
are
--
you're
to
file
tariffs
and
the
tariffs
are
to
be
reached
after
you
go
meet
in
committee;
and
that
would
also
fall
within
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
language
is
awfully
similar
to
what
you
find
in
public
utility
statutes:
to
set
reasonable
rates,
to
be
certain
that
nobody
is
higher
than
a
reasonable
rate.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
mean,
to
establish
rates
and
charges
for
the
services
and
use
of
the
facilities
of
the
authority?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
point
--
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt,
but
the
point
that
he's
making
in
response
to
my
earlier
questions
along
these
lines
i
think
was
the
following:
where
do
they
get
their
hospitals,
these
authorities?
the
law
sets
up
a
hospital
authority.
all
right.
where
did
they
get
their
hospitals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know
what
actually
happened?
do
you
know
in
fact
where
these
hospital
authorities
got
their
hospitals
from?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
mean
--
i
now
am
in
a
county
and
suddenly
i'm
a
mayor
and
i
see
this
law
and
it
says
we
can
set
up
a
hospital
authority.
so
joe,
i
say,
you
are
the
boss,
you
are
the
hospital
authority
guy.
and
he
says
--
you
are
to
run
the
hospital,
and
he
says,
what
hospital?
we
don't
have
a
hospital.
so
i
want
to
know
where
did
they
get
their
hospitals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
need
to
know
all
of
them.
i
just
want
some
rough
idea
where
they
come
from.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
may
not
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i've
got
it,
i've
got
it.
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
he
says
this:
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
the
wrong
way.
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
like
the
california
state
public
utilities
commission.
they
regulate
all
the
electricity
producers.
that
isn't
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
these
were
a
group
of
people
that
ran
some
hospitals,
some
municipal
hospitals.
and
now
they
can
acquire
not
just
general.
i
agree
with
you,
it
isn't
just
general.
they
have
a
lot
of
power
there
to
acquire
other
hospitals
from
outside
the
system;
but,
when
they
do
that,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
that
gives
them
the
power
to
acquire
it
where
it's
anticompetitive.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
fact
that
you
can
regulate
your
own
hospitals,
which
is
one
track
and
one
group,
doesn't
say
that
you
have
to
bring
in
anticompetitive
people
--
i
mean,
you
have
to
bring
in
others
where
they're
anticompetitive.
that
--
that
i
think
is
his
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
think
of
it
as
one
thing,
think
of
it
as
two
separate
systems.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
i
know
that.
but
once
you
don't,
once
you
don't,
he
says,
you
see,
they
don't
regulate
prices
at
non-authority
hospitals,
they
don't
do
this
for
non-authority,
they
don't
do
that
for
non-authority,
even
though
they
might
have
the
power
to
bring
them
in;
but,
when
they
have
the
power
to
bring
them
in,
why
read
this
--
it's
at
least
ambiguous
--
why
read
this
as
saying
you
can
bring
them
in
where
it's
anticompetitive
to
do
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
--
they
say
on
that,
that
it's
a
sham.
well,
just
say
30
seconds
on
their
argument
that
the
ftc
looked
into
it,
these
people
had
never
regulated
anything,
they'd
never
looked
at
any
price
anywhere,
they've
never
done
a
single
thing,
it's
a
sham;
and
therefore
that's
the
end
of
it.
what
about
that?
