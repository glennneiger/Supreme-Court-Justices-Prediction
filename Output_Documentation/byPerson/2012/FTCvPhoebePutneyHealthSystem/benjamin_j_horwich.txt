mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
action
doctrine
provides
a
defense
to
a
federal
antitrust
suit
when
a
state
has
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
an
intent
to
displace
competition
with
respect
to
the
particular
activity
at
issue
in
the
suit.
now,
in
practical
terms,
what
that
comes
down
to
is
whether
application
of
federal
competition
law
would
somehow
subvert
a
sovereign
state
policy
choice
that's
clearly
evident
in
state
law.
now,
that
policy
might
be
expressed
in
mandatory
or
compulsory
terms,
but,
short
of
that,
it
would
also
be
enough,
if
the
--
the
state
had
specifically
permitted
conduct
that
is
inherently
anticompetitive.
but
a
grant
of
general
power
to
act--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
think
it
is,
although
for
reasons
that
don't
affect
the
analysis
of
the
question
about
an
anticompetitive
acquisition.
and
let
me
explain
why
the
analysis
might
be
different
with
respect
to
prices.
there
is
specific
authorization
in
the
statute
for
the
hospital
authorities,
in
conjunction
with
the
counties,
to
partly
fund
--
or,
i
guess,
entirely,
in
principle
--
fund
their
services
through
tax
revenues.
so
they
have
another
source
of
funding
that
would
allow
them
to
price
in
ways
that
a
competitive
actor
would
not
necessarily
price
its
services.
so
if
we're
talking
about
particular
pricing
decisions
--
say
--
i
guess
it
would
be
below
cost
pricing
that
is
alleged
to
somehow
be
anticompetitive
--
then
there
might
very
well
be
a
state
action
defense
to
that
because
it
--
because
the
state
--
the
power
to
price
services
subsidized
in
a
way
that
an
ordinary
actor
wouldn't
be
able
to
do--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--might
very
well
displace
competition
in
that
regard.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
do
think--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yeah,
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
i
think
--
i
think
the
best
example
comes
from
goldfarb
v.
virginia
state
bar.
so
in
that
case,
the
issue
was
a
challenge
to
a
practice
of
minimum
fee
schedules
that
were
set
by
--
not
by
the
state,
but
agreed
upon
by
a
bar
organization.
now,
the
state
in
that
case
of
course
regulated
the
practice
of
law.
it
regulated
admission
into
the
practice
of
law.
it
regulated
certain
aspects
of
the
conduct
of
the
practice
of
law.
and
this
court
held
in
bates
v.
arizona
state
bar
that
those
sort
of
regulations
do
constitute
state
action.
but
the
court
did
not
accept
the
submission
that
the
state
action
defense
covered
the
setting
of
minimum
prices
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case,
because
that
was
not
something
that
there
was
state
action
over.
and
as
a
--
and
taking
a
step
back,
the
justification
for
the
state
action
doctrine
is
that
the
state
is
trying
to
pursue
some
policy
that
is
part
of
its
traditional
sovereign
prerogatives
to
regulate
its
own
economy,
and
that
federal
law
was
not
understood
to
intrude
upon
that.
but
if
the
state
is
not
actually
trying
to
advance
some
other
policy
with
respect
to
the
particular
conduct
at
issue,
then
it
can't
be
said
that
the
state
has
done
something
that
federal
law
should
stand
aside
for.
the--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
the
key
difference
there,
justice
ginsburg,
between
the
hypothetical
we
offered
in
the
reply
brief
and
the
statute
here
is
that
the
--
the
additional
words
“
any
and
all
”
make
it
clear
that
the
state
is
contemplating
that
there
could
--
the
county
might
opt
for
socializing
its
hospital
services,
putting
all
of
them
under
the
control
of
the
hospital
authority.
and
by
contrast,
what
we
have
here
is
an
ordinary
corporate
power
to
acquire
property.
and
like
all
of
the
ordinary
corporate
powers
that
the
authority
possesses
that
are
--
that
resemble
those
that
an
ordinary
business
corporation
would
have,
the
most
natural
understanding
of
them
is
that
the
state
expects
them
to
be
exercised
in
conformity
with
the
background
principles
that
bind
everybody.
so--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
it's
probably
in
our
--
the
hypothetical
offered
in
our
reply
brief,
it's
probably
the
“
all
”
--
the
“
any
and
all
”
that
would
i
think
be
what
communicates
the
state's--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--no,
i
don't
think
it
does.
well
--
but
i
think,
in
this
area,
it's
--
it's
important,
for
a
couple
reasons,
that
we
actually
have
--
have
some
substantial
assurance
of
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
here.
and
a
power
to
grant
proper
--
excuse
me
--
a
power
to
acquire
properties,
generally
speaking,
unadorned
with
any
particular
expression
from
the
state
about
how
--
how
that
power
is
to
be
used,
is
something
that
can
be
used
competitively
or
anticompetitively,
and
you
can't
infer
from
that
that
the
state
really
has
an
objective
of,
as
i
say,
such
as
socializing
its
hospital
services
because
--
and
--
and
that
clarity
of
expression
from
the
state
is
really
important
here,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
this
is
an
odd
rule
to
begin
with,
in
that
it
allows
state
law
to
displace
federal
law.
so
we
would
want
some
clarity
from--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yeah,
it
absolutely
does.
and--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--it
is
issued
by
the
state.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no,
we
don't.
and
we
don't
generally
think
that
those
corporate
powers
express
an
intent
to
displace
any
other
background--
if
i
could
give
some
examples,
maybe
we
could
look
at
some--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
--
i
think
the
defense
would
be
available
if
the
beginning
of
your
hypothetical
was
kind
of
quoting
the
statute,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
certainly,
the
hospital
authority
can
figure
it
--
figure
out,
but
what
it's
figuring
out
is
whether
to
actually
invoke
a
displacement
of
competition
that
the
state
has
expressly
put
on
the
table.
and
that's
what
is
different
in
this
case--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes,
that's
fine.
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
states
setting
up
a
clear
set
of
tools,
some
of
which,
in
your
example,
might
inherently
displace
competition--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--and
having
it
exercised,
actually,
at
a
local
level.
that's
fine.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no.
i
disagree
with
that.
the
reason
they
are
part
of
our
governing
test
is
this,
is
that
a
state
can
certainly
give
a
--
a
menu
of
specific
options
that
sub-state
entities
can
select
from.
and
it
might
be
that
some
of
those
are,
in
fact,
not
anticompetitive.
let
me
give
you
an
example
from
this
court's
cases.
southern
motor
carriers
involved
the
submission
of
--
by
motor
carriers
of
their
rates
to
a
public
service
commission
that
was
--
that
would
accept
them
as
filed
rates.
now,
the
states
--
some
of
the
states
there
said,
well,
you
can
file
them
individually,
or
you
can
file
them
jointly,
and
we
don't
necessarily
have
a
preference
one
way
or
the
other
for
it.
but
the
fact
that
the
states
had
said
you
can
file
them
jointly,
which
is
a
horizontal
agreement
among
competitors
and
sure
looked
anticompetitive,
the
fact
that
the
state
had
said
that
and
put
that
option
on
the
table
qualified
as
a
clear
articulation
from
the
state
that
it
intended
the
displacement
of
competition
to
occur
if
that
specific
option
was
chosen.
the
difference
here
is
that
if
you
are
willing
to
say
in
a
case
like
what
we
have
here
with
a
statute
that
confers
a
--
a
power
that
is
entirely
neutral
as
to
how
it
would
be
--
how
it
could
be
exercised,
you
have
the
problem
of
not
really
knowing
what
the
state
would
intend.
and
so
you
can't
say
that
the
state
clearly
intended
that
there
be
displacement
of
competition--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--sure.
well,
i
guess
i
would
--
i
guess
i
would
first
point
out
that
price
competition
is
not
the
be-all
and
end-all
of
anticompetitive
consequences,
right.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
mean,
we
have
this
concern
--
obviously,
we
have
a
concern
here
that
without
--
and
this
is
detailed
very
clearly
in
the
complaint.
i
mean,
i
think
starting
with
paragraph
8,
it
talks
about
some
of
the
price
--
some
of
the
pricing
constraints.
but
you
get
on
to
the
later
paragraphs
of
the
complaint,
you
have
all
these
descriptions
of
loss
of
quality
competition
here.
so
you
have--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes,
and
i
guess
that
is
what
i'm
--
i
guess
that
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
is
that
mergers
are
different
because
the
challenged
anticompetitive
act
here
is
not
a
pricing
decision
by
the
hospitals.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yeah.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no,
i
--
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
whether
that
is
--
i
don't
know
whether
that
is
true
or
not,
but
i
think
we're
relying
on
the
more
--
i
think
you
can't
simply
start
with
the
idea
that,
well
--
you
can't
start
with
the
premise
that
this
act
exists
to
pursue
an
objective
and
to
pursue
it
at
any
cost,
without
regard
to
whether
it
displaces
competition
in
the
market
for
paid
health
care
services,
without
regard
to
whether
it
displaces
competition
for
quality
among
these
hospitals.
i
mean,
on
that
logic
--
and
i
think
it
might
help
to
look
at
some
of
the
other
powers
here.
if
you
go
to
the
back
of
the
government's
brief
on
page
6a,
the
authority
has
the
power
to
make
and
execute
contracts.
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
implies
a
privilege
to
enter
price-fixing
contracts.
that's
part
of
the
background
principles
of
antitrust
law.
i
also
don't
think
it
implies
the
power
to
enter
contracts
against
public
policy.
a
state
presumably
doesn't
wish
to
abandon
that
background
principle
simply
because
it
wants
the
authority
to
pursue
its
mission.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
exactly.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no,
i
agree
with
that,
that
it
doesn't
categorically.
but
it
does
--
it
does
seem
to
me
that
--
that
if
we're
looking
through
this
list
of
powers
that
the
hospital
authorities
have,
there
is
not
anything
meaningfully
different
about
the
power
to
acquire
property
versus
make
contracts
versus,
as
justice
scalia
said,
any
other
powers
that
are
--
that
exist
in
a
general
corporation's
business
charter.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
no,
because
i
think
the
baseline
when
the
statute
was
enacted
was
that
the
hospital
authorities
didn't
even
exist.
so
they
didn't
own
any
hospitals.
and
the
first
acquisition
of
a
hospital
can't
raise
a
competitive
concern
because
it's
not
concentrating
the
market
in
any
way.
it's
simply
transferring
ownership
of
the
hospital
from
one
actor
to
another.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
i
think
you'd
have
to
imagine
a
very
stylized
hypothetical
to
see
that
the
state
had
clearly
intended
to
displace
competition.
you
would
want
to
see,
for
example
--
let
me
give
you
an
example--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--right.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
right,
but
i
suppose
that
the
guesswork
is
not
going
to
be
a
basis
for
saying
a
state
has
clearly
intended
to
displace
competition.
the
situation
in
which
i
think
you
might
recognize
it
is
if
the
hospital
authorities
were
already
in
existence,
but
they
--
and
they
all
each
owned
a
hospital,
but
they
had
never
had
the
power
to
acquire
a
hospital,
and
you
knew
that
they
were
all
--
that
each
of
them
had
their
neighboring
competitor,
and
then
the
legislature
comes
in
and
says:
you
know,
we
would
like
you
now
to
actually
be
able
to
acquire
--
acquire
additional
hospitals.
i
mean,
the
power
here
is
not
the
power
to
acquire
additional
hospitals.
but
if
the
legislature
had
said,
we
have
the
power
to
acquire
additional
hospitals
and
we
know
you
already
have
one,
and
we
know
that
the
one
you
are
going
to
acquire
is
going
to
be
your
neighbor
and
we
know
there
is
not
lots
of
hospitals
out
there,
then
you
might
say
that,
yes,
the
clear
implication
of
that
is
that
that's
going--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
the--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
where
your
honor
is
looking.
they
aren't
actually
--
they
don't
follow
themselves
in
the
statute,
but--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--right.
and
so
i
think
what
you
are
referring
to
is
number
--
number
27
on
the
list.
and
i
think
in
the
health
care
industry
the
idea
of
forming
a
network
is
not
the
idea
of
socializing
all
of
the
available
resources
under
government
control.
a
network
is
an
integrated
system
where
you
can
go
to
the
hospital
for
your
emergency
care
and
they
can
refer
you
to
an
outpatient
clinic
that
they
have
somewhere
else,
and
there
is
a
physician
who
has
an
arrangement
with
both
of
those
who
can
track
your
care.
and
you
can
go
acquire
your
durable
medical
equipment
from
some
--
from
some
store
they
operate.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
that's
what
a
network
is.
that's
not
vertical
integration.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes,
exactly
right.
that's
a
tying
situation.
this
is
--
this
is
a
merger
within
--
within
one
relevant
market.
and
that's
what's
different.
so
i
don't
think
the
27--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--it
does.
but
so
--
it
does,
but
there
is
nothing
about
acquiring
a
project
that
is
inherently
--
that's
inherently
anticompetitive.
acquisitions
are
not
always
anticompetitive.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
no,
i
think
--
i
think
horizontal--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--generally
horizontal
agreements,
i
think
you
--
so
the
contracting
power
doesn't
--
doesn't
allow
the
hospital
authority
to
go
--
i
don't
think
the
hospital
here
could
any
more
merge
with
palmyra
than
it
could
go
enter
into
a
contract
with
palmyra
that
says,
hey,
we
are
going
to,
you
know,
fix
the
prices
that
we--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--absolutely,
your
honor.
this
statute
--
and
take
a
step
back--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--no,
i
think
those
would
likely
be
very
different.
i
want
to
be
clear
about--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--the
point.
the
point
of
this
law
is
to
grant
counties
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
market
by
providing
care
to
indigents.
this
is
not
a
law
about
public
utility
regulation.
if
you
think
that
this
is
a
law
about
public
utility
regulation,
that
all
hospitals
are
supposed
to
be
--
that
the
state
intends
counties
to
be
able
to
elect
to
put
all
hospitals
under
their
control
and
manage
them
as
such
and
manage
them
in
the
way
that
a
public
service
commission
would
regulate
all
of
the
utilities--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
the
authority
does
not
have
the
power
to
--
justice
breyer,
the
authority
does
not
have
the
power
to
establish
rates
at
private
hospitals.
and
that
--
that
would
be
a
signal
difference
between
the
authority's
power
in
this
case
and
the
power
of
a
public
service
regulator
over
a
--
over
a
utility.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
facilities
of
the
authority,
yes,
but
not
other
hospitals
within
the
jurisdiction.
it's
only
--
it's
only
the
hospitals
that
the
authority
itself
is
--
is
operating.
and
so
--
so
i
guess
we
also
have
here
--
i
want
to
be
clear
that
in
all
of
this
discussion
we
are
operating
on
the
premise
that
it's
actually
the
authority
itself
that
is
operating
the
hospital.
of
course,
that
is
not
what
this
case
is.
the
hospital--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--right.
no,
we
don't
think
it
means
that.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
no,
it's
not
a
normative
judgment.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
correct.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
exactly.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
our
definition
--
our
definition
--
well,
i
have
to
be
honest
with
you,
it's
hard
to
define
it
because
it's
going
to
arise
in
a
number
of
different
contexts.
but
what
this
--
but
the
times
where
this
court
has
used
it,
it
has
used
it
to
convey
the
idea
that
the
choice
that
the
state
is
offering
is
no
choice
at
all
if
federal
law
is
going
to
come
in;
that
federal
law
would
just
negate
the
choice.
so
to
be
concrete
about
this,
in
hallie,
for
example,
the
choice
that
the
state
provided
at
the
end
of
kind
of
a
complicated
line
of
statutory
rules
about
how
cities
do
or
don't
have
to
provide
their
sewage
treatments
to
their
neighbors,
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
city
had
a
choice
to
say,
fine,
we
will
give
you
sewage
treatment
services,
but
you
have
to
be
annexed
to
us
and
take
the
other
things
that
come
with
annexation
to
the
city.
now,
if
that
choice
is
--
is
--
if
that
choice
is
anticompetitive,
it's
going
to
be
taken
away
by
federal
law.
and
the
choice
that
the
state
has
tried
to
offer
is
no
choice
at
all.
it's
going
to
be
negated,
and
the
only
choice
left
for
the
city
in
hallie
is
going
to
be
to
opt
--
to
just
relent
and
get
the
sewage
treatment
service--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
in
your
hypothetical
we
are
imagining
kind
of
a
municipality
enabling
act
that
just
has,
you
know,
a
section
in
it
that
says:
municipalities
shall
enjoy
the
state's
exemption--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
so
that
--
that's
not
a
clear
articulation
problem
because
it's
plenty
clear
what
the
state's
trying
to
do.
there
might
be
what
i
would
call
an
affirmative
expression
problem
there
because
simply
saying
that
the
state
doesn't
want
the
antitrust
laws
to
apply,
that's
not
the
basis
in
federalism
for
the
state
action
doctrine.
the
basis
in
federalism
is
that
the
state
has
made
some
affirmative
choice
that
it
wants
to
accomplish
something
else,
and
that
it's
offered
some
principle
on
which
the
sub-state
actors
can
act
to
serve
the
state's
policy
interests.
and
so
i
think
you
might
have
to
hesitate
in
a
case
like
that
to
say,
well,
if
the
state
is
just
passing
out
indulgences
to
--
to
get
out
of
federal
competition
law,
that
may
not
be
something
substantively
federal
law
will
stand
aside
for.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
was
assuming
in
justice
kagan's
hypothetical
that
we
had
some
of
the
other
things
going
on
here
that
manifested
a
particular
objective
that
the
state
was
trying
to
pursue.
so
sort
of
a
state
trying
to
pursue
municipal
governance
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
enough
of
an
affirmative
state
policy
to
say
that
works.
so
i
think
that
would
distinguish
the
two.
and
if
i
could
reserve.
thank
you.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
thank
you.
i
guess
i
--
i
heard
several
members
of
the
court
asking
mr.
waxman
specifically:
where
do
you
find
this?
where
can
you
locate
this
intent
to
displace
competition
in
the
statute?
and
i
would
like
to
just
run
through,
if
i
could,
each
of
his
answers
and
why
i
think
they
are
insufficient.
so
the
first
one,
of
course,
we've
talked
a
lot
about
the
existence
of
general
corporate
powers,
but
the
most
natural
inference
there
is
that
the
state
expects
those
to
be
exercised
in
conformity
with
the
background
principles
that
anybody
else
who
has
general
powers
has.
now,
the
idea
that
the
authority
has
a
mandate,
a
purpose
it's
supposed
to
serve,
of
course
that's
always
true.
states
always
have
some
purpose
in
mind
when
they
set
up
some
sub-state
entity.
the
question
isn't
whether
there
is
particular
ends
the
state
is
trying
to
pursue.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
state
intended
to
pursue
those
ends
through
the
particular
means
of
displacing
competition,
here,
displacing
competition
in
the
market
for
paid
health
care
services.
and
mr.
waxman
also
pointed
to
the
rate
of
return
provision
in
the
statute.
now
as
a
sort
of
a
threshold
matter,
there's
--
if
past
is
prologue,
there
is
not
any
reason
to
think
that
that
will
be
not
be
rigorously
enforced
with
respect
to
the
privately
controlled
operations
here.
but
--
and
that's
sort
of
the
second
question
presented,
and
we
can
set
that
aside
for
the
moment,
i
guess.
but
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
far
more
natural
explanations
for
the
presence
of
the
rate
of
return
provision
in
the
statute
than
the
one
mr.
waxman
would
like
you
to
--
to
give
to
it.
the
first
explanation
is:
this
is
a
statute
about
providing
public
care
for
indigents.
nobody
should
be
making
a
profit
off
of
that
and
the
state
wants
to
say
that.
and
that
seems
to
be
a
very
natural
explanation
that
doesn't
depend
at
all
on
the
state
intending
to
displace
competition
completely.
the
--
the
rate
--
the
price
regulation
provision
also
can
be
naturally
understood
as
a
response
to
the
recognition
that
there
will
be
some
de
facto
monopolies
in
the
situation
where
there
is
only
one
hospital
in
the
county.
but
it
does
not
mean
that
the
state
wants
there
to
be
more
monopolies
so
that
it
can
bring
in
the
unfortunate
medicine
of
rate
regulation
to
respond
to
those.
presumably,
the
state
intends,
as
is
the
accepted
background
principle
of
free
market
competition
in
this
country,
that
there
won't
be
monopolies
unless
they
--
unless
they
arise
of
necessity.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
right.
well,
the
--
the
--
i
--
i
don't
think
the
two
are
entirely
--
are
entirely
separable
as
a
matter
of
competition
law,
because
the
reason
the
competition
law
is
concerned
with
mergers
is
not
because
of
the
transaction
as
such,
but
it's
because
of
what
it
does
going
forward
to
the
structure
of
the
market
and
the
competitive
behavior
of
those
in
the
market.
and
so
the
state
action
doctrine
says
that
the
state
--
if
the
state's
going
to
go
create
monopoly,
it
needs
to
take
ownership
of
that
monopoly.
and
i'm
using
ownership
not
in
the
literally
sense,
but
at
least
ownership
in
the
sense
of
actively
supervising
the
monopoly
to
be
sure
that
it
is
pursuing
the
--
the
objective
that
the
state
has
in
mind
for
creating
it.
so
that's
--
that's
why
we
are
still
concerned
there.
mr.
waxman
referred
to
the
certificate
of
need
law.
i
think
there
is
a
very
close
analogy
to
be
drawn
to
goldfarb
here.
that
is
the
--
the
question
of
minimum
fee
schedules
agreed
to
by
lawyers.
the
state
of
--
the
state
of
virginia
regulated
entry
into
the
market
for
the
practice
of
law
just
as
the
certificate
of
need
regulates
entry
into
the
hospital
market.
but
horizontal
agreements
among
people
already
in
the
market,
such
as
here
and
such
as
the
minimum
fee
schedule
in
goldfarb,
are
not
exempt
just
because
of
it.
thank
you.
