you
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
have
any
cases
in
which
we
--
we
slice
it
that
fine--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
--
that
you
are
a
state
actor
for
some
anticompetitive
purposes
and
not
for
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
the
normal
corporate
charter
contains
such
a
provision,
the
authority
to
acquire
property,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
don't
--
that
charter
is
issued
by
the
state,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
that
that
enables
all
corporations
to
ignore
the
sherman
act,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
how
any
of
that
pertains
to
whether
they
can
create
a
hospital
monopoly.
you
can
do
all
of
that,
even
though
you
are
not
the
only
hospital
in
the
area.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
the
only
respect
relevant
here
is
--
the
only
respect
relevant
is
the
ability
to
acquire
other
hospitals.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
--
and
that's
a
general
corporate
power.
every
corporation
in
georgia
has
the
power
to
acquire,
including
acquire
other
businesses.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
a
lot
of
states
have
that.
you
can't
open
a
new
hospital
without
getting
a
certificate
of
need.
are
you
saying
that
in
all
of
those
states
the
result
is
that
the
antitrust
laws
can
be
ignored?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waxman,
if
you
don't
want
to
be
interrupted,
you
have
to
pause
between
sentences.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
that's
right.
you've
given
a
--
you
know,
an
appealing
example
of
a
small
county
that
has
one
--
one
hospital,
and
this
operation
purchases
that
one
hospital.
seems
nothing
wrong
with
that;
although,
as
justice
sotomayor
suggests,
i
doubt
whether
the
ftc
would
be
pursuing
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
natural
monopoly.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
monopoly
would
be
owned
by
the
state
or
not.
but
your
argument,
if
we
follow
it,
embraces
a
quite
different
situation,
a
very
large
county
which
has
five
hospitals
that
are
competing
vigorously
in
price,
in
specialties,
they
advertise
on
the
radio,
as
some
hospitals
do.
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
operation
can
take
over
all
of
those
hospitals
and
eliminate
all
of
that
competition.
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
no
--
we
have
no
idea
whether
they
are
willing
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
have
a
federal
antitrust
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
didn't
it
intend
this?
i
don't
understand.
you
--
you've
told
us
that
they
did
intend
this,
that
they
did
intend
to
displace
competition.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
now
you
say:
but
georgia
will
say:
oh,
no,
they
didn't
intend
to
displace
competition.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
it?
