chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-1160,
the
federal
trade
commission
v.
phoebe
putney
health
system.
mr.
horwich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
so
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
you're
saying
there
would
be
a
difference
if
the
charter
said
the
authority
may
require
--
acquire
any
properties
to
fulfill
its
mission,
and
if
it
said
the
authority
may
acquire
properties
to
promote
its
mission?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
a
general
saying
they
may
acquire
properties
doesn't
implicitly
say
they
may
acquire
all
properties.
that
seems
a
pretty
thin--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
you've
already
told
us
that
it
can
be
state
action
for
some
purposes
and
not
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
the
fact
that
you
have
examples
where
you
might
conclude,
no,
they
didn't
mean
to
do
that,
doesn't
seem
to
categorically
suggest
that
you
prevail
with
respect
to
another
one
of
the
powers
that
are
granted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
may
be
completely
wrong.
you
can
tell
me.
i
would
doubt
that
in
counties
or
municipalities
of
this
size
you
are
going
to
have,
you
know,
five
hospitals,
and
so
that
the
authority
could
acquire
a
hospital
and
yet
still
it
not
have
any
significant
merger
consequences
on
its
face.
in
other
words,
when
this
law
was
passed
giving
them
the
power
to
acquire
hospitals,
wasn't
it
the
case
that
there
would
likely
be
only
one
other
hospital
or
two,
so
that
any
acquisition
of
another
hospital
would
have
the
merger
consequences
that
this
one
had?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
the
state
--
does
the
state
have
a
procedure
where
it
can
give
real-time
approval?
in
other
words,
this
is
going
on
and
the
hospital
authority
says,
boy,
the
ftc
is
sending
us
these
letters.
state,
could
you
do
something
to
show
that
you
approve
this
transaction,
whether
it's
a
special
law
or
there
is
some
organization
i
guess
in
some
other
case
setup,
that
could
give
its
approval?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know.
but
i
guess
my
point
is,
can
the
burden
of
going
forward
be
switched
the
other
way,
and
can
this
hospital
authority
say,
you
know,
to
the
state,
we
would
like
some
blessing
on
this
so
that
we
can
go
ahead
with
it?
so
the
choices
aren't
really
build
your
own
hospital
or
acquire
the
other
one
in
the
abstract,
but
ask
the
state,
you
know,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
do
you
want
us
to
build
a
new
hospital,
or
is
it
okay
if
we
acquire
this
one?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
horwich,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1160,
federal
trade
commission
versus
phoebe
putney
health
system.
