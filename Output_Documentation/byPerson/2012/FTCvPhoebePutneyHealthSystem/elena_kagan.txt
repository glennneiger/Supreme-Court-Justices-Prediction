justice
elena
kagan
mr.
horwich,
could
i
just
--
before
you
give
examples,
just
make
sure
i
understand
your
basic
position.
suppose
this
statement
said
very
clearly
that
these
hospital
authorities
had
the
power
to
engage
in
acquisitions
of
hospitals
that,
for
a
normal
actor,
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
but
--
but
basically
said
the
hospital
authorities
had
the
discretion
to
do
that
or
not.
and
the
state
didn't
know
the
hospital
authority
might
do
it,
but
it
also
might
not
do
it.
that
would
be
subject
to
the
immunity;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
the
sheer
grant
of
authority,
but
the
authority
is
completely
discretionary.
so
the
state
is
basically
saying,
we
don't
know;
we're
going
to
let
the
hospital
authority
figure
it
out.
justice
elena
kagan
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
the
state
has
put
it
on
the
table
only
as
a
completely
discretionary
action.
the
state
has
not
expressed
a
preference
for
it.
the
state
has
only
said
that
the
hospital
authority
can
think
about
conditions
on
the
ground
in
its
particular
locality
and
can
decide
whether
such
an
anticompetitive
acquisition
is
appropriate.
justice
elena
kagan
so
all
of
this
language--
justice
elena
kagan
--so
all
this
language
in
your
brief
about
necessarily
and
inherently
and
compelled,
all
of
those
things
really
are
not
part
of
your
--
your
governing
test.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
waxman,
we
do
have
a
brief
from
quite
a
number
of
states,
and
the
brief
basically
says:
we
do
this
all
the
time;
we
set
up
these
local
authorities,
and
then
we
give
them
powers
because
they
have
to
act
in
the
world.
we
give
them
normal
powers,
like
the
ability
to
make
contracts
and
the
ability
to
buy
property.
and
when
we
do
that,
we
don't
mean
that
they
can
do
anything
they
want
notwithstanding
the
antitrust
laws.
and
to
construe
these
very
normal
powers
that
we
would
give
to
a
state
entity
in
order
to
allow
it
to
operate
as
a
permission
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
is
not
at
all
consistent
with
our
own
intentions.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
waxman,
could
i
understand
where
you
think
this
expressed
approval
is
coming
from?
because
you
said
general
corporate
powers
is
not
enough.
so
the
general
ability
to
buy
property,
you
said,
is
insufficient.
then
you
have
this
idea
they
have
a
mission.
but
the
mission
can
be
accomplished
in
all
kinds
of
ways
that
are
perfectly
consistent
with
the
antitrust
laws,
so
that
doesn't
seem
to
get
you
all
that
far.
so
what
else
have
you
got
to
show
that
the
state
actually
thought
about
this
issue
and
approved
this
power
for
the
hospital
authorities?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
waxman,
i
mean,
that's
right,
it
is
about
choices,
but
--
but
the
question
is
whether
the
state
has
made
a
choice.
and
that's
what
all
these
cases
are
about--
justice
elena
kagan
--is
our
trying
to
find
whether
the
state
has
made
a
choice
as
to
this
kind
of
conduct.
justice
elena
kagan
so
now
we
have
your
corporate
powers
aren't
enough,
your
general
mission
isn't
enough.
you
said
a
certificate
of
need,
but
a
certificate
of
need
isn't
even
given
out
by
this
authority.
it's
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
powers
of
this
authority.
then
you
said
there's
some
kind
of
a
price
regulation
that
happens
as
to
the
hospitals
that
the
authority
owns,
but
not
with
respect
to
other
hospitals.
so
i
guess
i'm
still
looking
for
the
things
that
show
that
the
state
has
made
a
choice
that
it
wants
these
--
these
hospital
authorities
to
be
able
to
make
anticompetitive
purchases.
where
do
i
find
that?
