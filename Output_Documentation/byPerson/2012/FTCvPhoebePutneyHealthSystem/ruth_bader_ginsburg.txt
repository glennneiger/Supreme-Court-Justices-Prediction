bader

mr.
horwich,
you
said
in
--
in
your
reply
brief
that
if
the
hospital
authorities
law
specifically
authorized
local
hospital
authorities
to
acquire
any
and
all
hospitals
within
their
geographic
area,
then
the
clear
articulation
requirement
would
be
satisfied.
but
the
authorities
law
does
authorize
the
acquisition
of
other
hospitals.
and
it
doesn't
say
one
or
two;
it
says
other
facilities.
so
why
doesn't
the
hospital
laws
law
do
exactly
what
you
said
would
satisfy
the
clear
articulation
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
georgia
wasn't
so
sure,
because
didn't
it
come
in
originally
on
the
side
of
the
ftc
in
this
case?

mr.

justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
waxman,
you
are
essentially
interpreting
the
georgia
statute
that
sets
up
the
hospital
authority.
and
you're
saying
this
is
how
we
read
it.
we
start
with
the
antitrust
exemption
is
for
the
state,
not
subdivisions,
so
the
state
has
to
give
it
to
the
subdivision
for
the
subdivision
to
have
it.
could
the
federal
court
have
said,
we'd
like
to
know
what
the
georgia
legislature
--
what
the
georgia
authorities
think
this
statute
means?
so,
could
a
question
have
been
certified
--
i
don't
know
if
georgia
has
a
certification
procedure,
but
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
--
and
said,
tell
us,
does
this
statute,
is
it
intended
to
transfer
the
state's
immunity
to
the
locality,
to
the
local
unit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is,
does
this
--
does
this
legislature
mean
that
the
state
is
transferring
its
immunity
to
this
local
unit?
