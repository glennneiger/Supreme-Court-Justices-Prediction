justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
think
that
the
grant
of
powers
in
this
case
would
permit
the
hospital
authorities,
the
corporation,
to
set
prices
for
their
services
that
are
below
the
competitive
prices
in
order
to
serve
the
needy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
that
inherent
in
the
regulations?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
network
is
tying
products,
to
tie
products.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess
that
just
adds
on
to
the
issues
that
we
have
a
price-fixing
mechanism,
we
have
a
tying
mechanism
that
is
expressed.
so
what's
left
after
that?
just
this?
mergers
and
acquisitions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
at
what
point--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--could
you
define
“
necessity
”
as
you
use
it?
i
am
hearkening
back
to
justice
kagan.
we
have
plenty
of
cases
that
say
you
don't
need
to
find
out
whether
the
exemption
is
necessary
to
make
the
program
work.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
don't
make
that
judgment.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
state
makes
that
judgment.
exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
in
your
answer,
you
conceded
that
whether
--
if
there
is
discretion,
it's
not
necessary
to
make
it
work
because
the
authority
can
say
yes
or
no--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
what's
your
definition
of
“
necessity
”?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--there
is
a
problem
here,
which
is,
i
understand
the
public
mandate
to
serve
the
indigent,
but
you
are
asking
us
to
take
this
a
step
further.
you're
elevating
that
public
mandate
to
a
public
command
that
serving
the
indigent
has
to
override
the
needs
of
the
majority
in
terms
of
price
competition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that,
that
step,
that
further
step
that
the
state
intended
to
immunize
their
--
the
monopoly
power,
is
the
step
we
are
trying
to
find
in
this
grant.
and
that's
what
i
don't
see.
i
see
the
compulsion
to
serve
the
needy.
i
hear
that
much
of
georgia
is
rural,
but
your
adversary
says
in
most
instances
there
is
only
one
hospital,
so
the
municipality's
taking
it
over
is
not
going
to
be
a
merger
issue.
to
the
extent
that
they
step
in
and
take
over
one
of
two
hospitals,
there
is
no
merger
issue
because
it's
only
substituting
one
owner
for
another.
this
situation
they
claim
is
a
rarity,
where
there
are
only
two
or
three
providers
and
a
hospital's
going
to
--
and
a
public
--
a
municipality
is
going
to
then
get
monopoly
power
by
an
acquisition.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
waxman,
i'm
showing
my
ignorance.
is
this
--
would
this
merger
be
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
it
were
--
if
we
were
not
to
find
state
immunity,
would
the
merger
be
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
was
embarrassed
to
ask
the
question,
but
i
was
taught
to
ask
the
question.
if
it
is
--
i'm
going
to
assume
that
we'll
both
be
--
we'll
both
be
corrected
by
our
respective
colleagues
soon
enough.
but
if
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that's
right.
but
--
but
my
question
is
really
more
fundamental,
which
is
yes,
i
understand
that
you
have
a
great
defense,
potentially,
to
a
rule
of
reason
challenge
that
--
that
there
was
necessity
in
its
truest
sense,
in
its
economic
sense
in
this
situation,
so
why
should
we
undo
our
decades
of
writings
that
say
that
we
should
construe
immunity
narrowly
and
not
broadly
when
it
comes
to
displacing
our
antitrust
laws?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
can
i
interrupt--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
just
a
moment
to
address
a
question
raised
by
justice
breyer,
which
is
your
alternative
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
have
lots
of
evidence
that
the
authority
does
very
little
oversight
of
these
hospitals
when
they
move
forward.
but
is
that
the
issue
before
us?
is
the
question
of
immunity
as
to
what
happens
in
the
operation
of
the
hospital,
or
in
their
merger
and
acquisition,
their
actual
formation?
and
--
so
that
to
the
extent
that
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
state
has
delegated
immunity
on
the
basis
of
merger?
why
do
we
need
to
look
any
further
at
whether
there
has
or
has
not
been
an
appropriate
degree
of
supervision
of
that
decision?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
federal
antitrust
laws
do
not
prevent
states
from
imposing
market
restraints
as
an
act
of
government.
this
case
concerns
a
scope
of
that
state
action
immunity
doctrine.
in
georgia,
towns
and
counties
may
create
special-purpose
public
entities
called
hospital
authorities
to
provide
hospital
services
to
residents
on
a
non-profit
basis.
georgia
law
gives
these
authorities
numerous
general
powers
including
the
power
to
acquire
in
these
hospitals.
the
hospital
authority
of
the
city
of
albany
and
dougherty
county
owns
memorial
hospital
which
is
one
of
two
hospitals
in
that
county.
the
authority
leases
memorial
to
a
private
non-profit
company
which
manages
memorial's
day-to-day
operations.
in
2010,
the
authority
approved
a
plan
to
acquire
the
second
hospital
in
the
county
until
lease
it
to
a
corporate
affiliate
of
the
company
that
operates
memorial.
the
federal
trade
commission
or
ftc
filed
an
administrative
complaint
and
then
sought
a
preliminary
injunction
arguing
that
the
planned
acquisition
would
substantially
reduce
competition
in
the
market
for
hospital
services
in
violation
of
section
5
of
the
ftc
act
and
sections
--
section
--
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
district
court
denied
the
request
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
dismissed
the
ftcs
claims
on
the
ground
that
the
authority
and
the
other
parties
to
the
transaction
were
entitled
to
antitrust
immunity
under
the
state
action
doctrine.
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed.
the
court
reasoned
that
georgia's
legislature
must
have
foreseen
that
the
grant
of
power
to
hospital
authorities
to
acquire
and
lease
hospitals
would
produce
anticompetitive
effects
because
acquisitions
could
consolidate
ownership
of
competing
hospitals.
we
grant
a
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
under
our
precedent,
a
local
governmental
entity,
like
the
authority
is
entitled
to
immunity
only
if
it
acts
pursuant
to
a
clearly
articulated
and
affirmatively
expressed
state
policy
to
displace
competition.
we
have
applied
that
just
practically
recognizing
that
state
legislatures
do
not
typically
catalogue
all
of
the
anticipated
effects
of
a
statute
delegating
authority
to
a
local
governmental
entity.
but
because
state
action
immunity
is
disfavored,
we
have
also
applied
the
test
rigorously
insisting
that
the
challenged
anticompetitive
effects
must
have
been
affirmatively
contemplated
by
the
state.
thus,
we
have
found
the
state
policy
to
displace
federal
antitrust
laws
as
sufficiently
expressed
in
cases
where
the
displacement
of
competition
was
the
inherent
logical
or
ordinary
result
of
the
exercise
of
authority
delegated
by
the
state
legislature.
in
that
scenario,
we
have
concluded
that
a
state
must
have
foreseen
an
implicitly
endorsed
the
anticompetitive
effects
as
consistent
with
its
policy
goals.
here,
there
is
no
evidence
that
georgia
affirmatively
contemplated
that
hospital
authorities
would
displace
competition
by
consolidating
hospital
ownership.
the
acquisition
of
leasing
powers
exercised
by
the
authority
in
the
challenge
transaction,
mirror
general
powers
routinely
conferred
by
state
law
upon
private
corporations.
such
general
grants
of
power
should
be,
can
be,
and
typically
are
used
in
ways
that
raise
no
federal
antitrust
concerns.
in
concluding,
otherwise,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
concept
of
foreseeability
from
our
clear
articulation
test
too
loosely.
while
it
is
always
possible
that
a
local
governmental
entity
might
exercise
general
powers
in
anticompetitive
ways,
a
reasonable
legislature's
ability
to
foresee
that
possibility
fells
--
falls
well
short
of
clearly
articulating
an
affirmative
state
policy
to
displace
competition.
respondents
insist
that
georgia
law
does
more
than
give
hospital
authority's
permission
to
play
in
the
market.
they
contend
that
because
hospital
authorities
are
granted
unique
powers
and
responsibilities
to
fulfill
the
state's
objective
of
providing
residents
with
the
access
to
adequate
and
affordable
hospital
care.
the
state
must
have
anticipated
that
the
authorities
would
decide
to
acquire
additional
local
hospitals
to
increase
their
capacity.
but
for
reasons
discussed
in
the
opinion,
we
find
nothing
in
georgia
law
that
clearly
articulates
a
state
policy
to
let
hospital
authorities
exercise
their
acquisition
power
without
regard
to
negative
effects
on
competition.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
is
reversed.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
