well,
but
to
follow
the
chief
justice's
question,
suppose
it
were
shown
that
there
were
many
rural
counties,
rural
areas
in
georgia
very
much
like
this
one.
would
that
change
this
case?
i
thought
that
was
the
purport
of
the
--
the
thrust
of
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
know
georgia
has
158
counties
or
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
think
they
probably
have
many
rural
areas
with
one
or
two
hospitals.
that's
just
a
guess.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
a
fair
characterization
of
your
argument
--
is
it
a
fair
characterization
of
your
argument
to
say
that
the
possibility
that
the
hospital
authority
can
use
this
general
power
in
this
way
is
tantamount
to
or
equivalent
to
the
legislature
intending
that
it
be
used
that
way?
is
that
your
argument?
