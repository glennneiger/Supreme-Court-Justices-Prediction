mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
specific
area
of
local
hospital
services,
the
georgia
legislature
has
adopted
a
model
of
local
public
choice,
including
the
choice
to
reduce
or
eliminate
competition.
there
is
no
issue
here,
justice
scalia,
with
respect
to
your
earlier
question,
of
general
corporate
powers.
the
hospital
authorities
law
creates
local
public
authorities
to,
quote,
"exercise
public
and
essential
government
functions
to
provide
hospital
care
for
residents,
especially
residents
who
cannot
pay.
"
it
empowers
authorities
to
acquire
projects,
plural,
specifically
including
each
authority
the
ability
to
acquire
hospitals,
plural,
but
with
limitations.
they
have
to
--
it
has
to
be
within
a
very
confined
geographic
and
demographic
jurisdiction.
and
for
authority
hospitals,
it
replaces
any
pure
market
model
with
statutory
mandates,
a
mandate
to
provide
services
to
all
indigent
in
the
community,
and
to
price
all
services
on
a
not-for-profit
basis
and
with
a
statutory
limitation
on
rate
of
return.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
guess
my
point
here
is
that
the
legislature's
--
the
powers
that
the
legislature
has
given
hospital
authorities
are
not
by
any
means
general
corporate
powers.
they
are
broader
than
what
a
corporation
may
have
in
certain
represents
and
much
narrower
in
other
respects.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
right.
and
there
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
--
there
--
these
--
these
are
--
the
supervening
wish,
mandate,
of
the
legislature,
and
this
is
well
explained
in
georgia
supreme
court
cases,
particularly
dejarnette,
which
was
decided
right
after
georgia
amended
its
constitution,
enacted
the
hospital
authorities
law,
was
the
desire
to,
the
goal
to
provide
adequate
hospital
services,
particularly
for
the
indigent.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
did.
and
georgia's
complaint
and
its
theory
in
the
district
court,
which
it
did
not
pursue
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
here,
was
not
that
the
authorities
weren't
exercising
state
power,
but
the
contention
that
the
operation
of
the
hospital
by
the
special
purpose
corporations
that
the
hospital
authority
created
was
not
adequately
supervised.
that
is
what
the
state
was
arguing
in
the
district
court.
and
when
it
lost
that
point,
it
withdrew
from
the
case
and
has
remained
absent
ever
since.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
have
no
problem
with
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
states
supporting
the
ftc
in
this
case,
which
is
positive,
quite
expressly
and
at
the
outset,
on
an
understanding
that
what
is
involved
here
is
simply
a
state
authorization
of
creation
of
a
local
entity
with
general
corporate
powers
and
nothing
more.
that
could
not
be
farther
from
this
case.
these
special
purpose
authorities
do
not
simply
have
general
corporate
powers.
they
have
a
mandate.
there
is
a
georgia
constitutional
amendment
that
coincided
with
the
enactment
of
the
hospital
authorities
law
that
derogated
the
state's
duty
to
provide
indigent
care
to
its
--
hospital
care
to
its
citizens.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
we
take
seriously
the
standard
that
this
court
announced
in
self-consciously
clarifying
the
level
of
explicitness
that
a
legislature
has
to
used
in
town
of
hallie.
this
court
said
--
the
court
asked
whether,
quote,
"suppression
of
competition
was
a
foreseeable
result
of
what
the
state
legislature
authorized.
"
and
it
derived
that
formulation
expressly
from
its
earlier
decision
in
city
of
lafayette,
which
explains
that
a,
quote,
"adequate
state
mandate
exists
when
it
can
reasonably
be
inferred.
"
quote,
"from
the
authority
given
a
local
entity
to
operate
in
a
given
area
that
the
legislature
contemplated
the
kind
of
action
complained
of.
"
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
this
court's
test,
whether
what
was
done
by
the
hospital
authority
or
any
sub-state
entity
was
foreseeable
by
a
reasonable
legislator,
which
in
this
case
is
that
--
was
it
foreseeable
that
in
--
in
pursuing
the
state-imposed
mandate
to
serve
the
indigent
in
a
confined
jurisdiction,
especially
in
rural
counties
which
abound
in
georgia,
a
hospital
authority
might
require
market
power
or
even
a
public
service
monopoly,
because
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--is
the
natural
way
to
acquit
the
statutory
mandate.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
i
don't,
i
don't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--so,
justice
sotomayor,
as
to
your
first
point,
our
position
is
not
that
the
only
mandate
is
to
serve
the
indigent.
the
actual
mandate
in
the
constitution
and
the
hospital
authorities
law
is
to
provide
hospital
services
for
all
residents,
with
a
particular
note
to
the
obligation
to
serve
indigent
clients.
second
of
all,
we
are
not
here
to
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know
where
the
government
is
coming
up
with
its
speculation
that
out
of
georgia's,
i
think
it's
154
counties
for
a
population
of
10
million
people,
it
is
the
rare
instance
in
which
there
will
be
anything
other
than
just
one
or,
you
know,
a
multiplicity
of
hospitals.
i
mean
the
federal
trade
commission
guidelines
for
market
concentration
is
anything
up
to
four,
four
or
fewer
participants.
the
notion
that
the
legislature
in
1941
was
providing
the
express
authority
to
acquire
multiple
hospitals
in
a
single
municipality
or
county
was
focused
only
on
huge
metropolises,
of
which
there
was
only
one,
or
on
counties
that
were
so
small
that
they
couldn't
otherwise
even
attempt
to
support
more
than
one
hospital
is
just
fanciful;
it's
made
up.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
okay.
i
mean,
for
one
--
one
other
thing
is
in
section
7-77,
as
was
noted
before,
the
authorities
are
subject
to
regulation
of
rate
of
return.
now,
if
that
doesn't
bespeak
the
foreseeable
consequence
of
market
power,
i
don't
know
what
does.
that
is
the
hallmark
of
a
regulated
public
service
monopoly
or
at
least
the
regulation
of
a
return
by
a
participant
with
market
power.
the
other
thing
that
exists
and
the
government
pooh-poohs
it
as
somehow
not
part
of
the
hospital
authorities
law
is
that
the
georgia
state
legislature
has
--
this
law
was
enacted
in
the
backdrop
of
other
laws
in
which
georgia
has
quite
deliberately
displaced,
quote,
“
unfettered
private
market
competition
”.
the
certificate
of
need
law
is
the
paradigmatic
example
of
the
imposition
of
regulation
at
the
expense
of
free
market
competition
and
in
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
our
argument
is
not
that
the
certificate
--
that
the
existence
of
the
certificate
of
need
law
indicates
an
intent
by
the
legislature
to
fully
displace
the
antitrust
laws
with
respect
to
anybody
else.
my
point
is
in
the
context
of
other
georgia
systems
that
strictly
limit
entry
into
or
expansion
into
these
local
markets,
combined
with
very
severe
rate
restrictions
and
obligations
and
mandates
to
serve--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
can
--
i
mean,
the
legislature
permits
them
to
be
built,
bought--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--you
mean
all
of
the
hospitals
authorities
in
georgia?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
answer,
justice
breyer,
i
think
--
i
mean
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
where
all
the
hospitals--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
let's
take
the
example--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
no,
no.
let's
take
the
example
of
this
county
in
terms
of
what
was
done
and
what
is
now
being
challenged.
so
when
the
hospital
--
there
was
a
public
hospital
beginning
in
1911
in
dougherty
county.
when
the
state
constitution
was
amended
to
impose
on
counties
the
state's
obligation
to
provide
adequate
hospitalization
care,
it
enacted
the
hospital
authority
law
for
counties
that
chose
to
make
use
of
that
device
in
order
to
acquit
their
public
service
mandate.
and
dougherty
county
did
soon
thereafter--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--establish
an
authority,
and
the
assets,
all
of
the
assets
and
all
of
the
operations
of
the
existing
hospital,
were
transferred.
there
then
--
and
there
was
a
natural
monopoly
in
that
county.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
then--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we're
not
arguing
that
the
hospital
authority
law
gives
the
hospital
authorities
the
right
to
regulate
non-authority
hospitals.
we're
not
arguing
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
mean,
this
doesn't
say
you
can
bring
them
in
where
it's
anticompetitive
to
do
so.
that's
their
any
and
all
hypothetical.
and
this
court
has
never
required,
for
good
reason,
express
authority.
that
was
the
whole
point
of
city
of
hallie
and
city
of
lafayette
--
town
of
hallie
and
city
of
lafayette.
the
point
here
is,
okay,
so
they
created
a
hospital
authority,
it
ran
a
public
hospital,
it
was
a
natural
monopoly.
the
county
grew.
a
private
hospital
developed.
the
public
hospital,
which
is
serving
more
than
ten
times
the
number
of
indigent
patients
than
the
private
hospital,
which
is
very
underused,
the
county
hospital
has
been
--
the
hospital
authority
has
been
saying
for
years
and
years
and
years,
we
need
more
capacity,
we
need
more
capacity.
there
are
--
in
order
to
accomplish
our
mission,
there
are
two
ways
to
do
it.
we
can
only
operate
in
this
confine.
we
can
build
a
new
hospital,
and
here's
what
it
would
cost,
and
here's
what
we
would
get.
and
we
would,
by
the
way,
have
to
satisfy
the
state
authorities
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
certificate
of
need
in
the
context
in
which
the
private
hospital
is
severely
underutilized.
or
we
can
talk
with
the
private
hospital
about
whether
they
would
like
to
be
acquired.
and
the
record
shows
that
they
did
that
for
many,
many
years,
even
before
the
phoebe
putney
entities
were
created.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you
mean
if
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
am
embarrassed
to
say
i
don't
know
enough
about
sherman
act
laws--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--probably
me
sooner
than
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
because
the
point
of
state
action
immunity,
which
is
respect
for
the
sovereign
choices
of
sovereign
states,
is
--
exists
not
only
to
provide
a
defense
--
an
ultimate
defense
in
litigation
on
the
merits,
it's
to
protect
states
and
sub-state
entities
from
the
cost
of
litigating.
i
mean,
the
question
ultimately
in
this
case,
and
in
all
these
cases,
is,
who
gets
to
decide?
who
gets
to
decide
if
this
is
reasonable
or
not?
is
it
the
federal
trade
commission
that
comes
in
and
files
a
lawsuit
for
this
poor
hospital
authority?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
may
not
be
able
to
convince
you,
but
let
me
take
another
run.
i
think
it's
the
combination.
because,
as
this
court
has
expressed
repeatedly,
it's
--
one
has
to
look
at
the
specific
power
granted,
which
here
is
the
power
to
acquire
hospitals
within
a
very
circumscribed
jurisdiction,
in
the
context
of
the
law
as
a
whole.
the
context
of
the
law
as
a
whole
here
--
and
i
hope
this
works
for
the
court,
but
if
it
doesn't,
you
know,
perhaps
i
am
wrong;
it
certainly
makes
this
a
stronger
case
than
hallie
--
here
we
have
a
law
that
says
counties
have
the
obligation
now,
unlike
the
state,
to
provide
adequate
hospitalization
services.
they
will
exercise
--
what
they
do
is
deemed
to
exercise
public
and
essential
government
function
within
strictly
limited
areas.
and
they
have
the
power
to
acquire
hospitals
in
those
areas
subject
to
very
strict
rate
of
return
regulations
and
very,
very
strict
conditions
on
how
they
operate
those
hospitals,
including
the
power
to
lease
to
an
operator
for
--
in
order
to
serve
the
public
mission.
and
they
do
that
against
the
backdrop
of
a
series
of
--
they
have
eminent
domain
power.
they
can
take
another
hospital
if
it
is
essential
to
fulfill
their
mission.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
they
do
this
in
a
backdrop
of
a
state
that
has
--
notwithstanding
the
advocacy
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
has
repeatedly
strengthened,
rather
than
abrogated,
a
--
a
certificate
of
need
law
that
leads--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
mean,
i
--
i
--
i
assume
that
the
georgia
state
courts
could
do
that;
but,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
ftc
doesn't
dispute
that
the
--
that
hospital
authority
--
county
hospital
authorities
are,
in
fact,
agents
or
arms
of
the
state--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
i
believe
the
ftc
--
mr.
horwich
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
--
but
i
believe
the
ftc's
position
is
generally,
yes,
but
not
with
respect
to
the
merge
--
what
is
alleged
to
be
a
merger
to
monopoly.
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
acts
under
this
law
and
applying
the
foreseeable
result
standard,
whether
the
acts
of
the
hospital
authority
in
this
case
in
approving
and
acquiring
the
second
hospital
are
fairly
attributable
to
the
state.
and
if
i
could
just--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
was
taking
a
cue
from
your
honor's
last
argument.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
--
for
purposes
of
federal
antitrust
law,
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
for
purposes
of
state
law,
almost
certainly
no.
and
the
point
here
is
--
and
that
is
the
point
here.
the
point
is
that
georgia,
either
through
both
private
suits
and
actions
authorized
by
its
attorney
general,
can
take
steps
in
order
to
restrain
hospital
authorities
from
doing
what
they
can.
and
in
fact--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
yes,
we
do.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
--
we
absolutely
do,
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
solid
line
of
cases
in
which
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
--
has
quite
rigorously
enforced
the
limitations
of
the
hospital
authority
law
in
order
to
prevent
hospital
authorities
from
doing
things
that
it
says
the
legislature
didn't
intend.
the
tift
county
case
is
the
best
example,
but
there
are
others
cited
in
our
brief.
the
last
point--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
no,
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
my
point
is
that,
with
respect
to
your
hypothetical,
whether
the
hospital
authority
of
fulton
county
--
and
i
believe
there
is
more
than
one
hospital
authority
in
fulton
county
and
they
are
authorized
to
merge
in
any
event
--
but
could
they
acquire,
by
purchase
or
eminent
domain,
all
of
the
hospitals
in
metropolitan
atlanta
to
do
so?
and
my
point
is
that
for
purposes
of
federal
antitrust
law
the
answer
is:
you
are
out.
that's
--
you
are
not
the
authority
to
inquire.
the
question
is
--
just
as
this
court
--
you
explained
for
the
court
in
omni,
there
may
be
very
many
things
that
a
local
authority
can
do
that
would
violate
state
law,
and
there
are
state
law
remedies.
and
my
point
only
was
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
been
very
quick
to
enforce
the
limitations,
but
as
a
matter
of
federal
antitrust
law
the
only
question
is:
were
they
--
were
they
authorized
to
do
things
like
this?
and
if
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--okay.
if
i
can
just
finish
my
answer
to
justice
--
i
have
one
other
point
to
make
for
--
to
justice
kagan,
who
has
asked
it
twice.
my
last
point
i
want
to
make,
and
then
i
will
answer
this,
is
that
this
county,
this
hospital
authority,
like
many,
facing
a
capacity
constraint
and
a
--
and
a
nondiscretionary
mandate
to
serve
the
public
needs
for
hospitalization,
had
two
choices:
it
could
have
tried
to
convince
the
state
to
spend
three
times
as
much
money
to
get
half
the
number
of
beds,
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
excess
capacity;
or
it
could
buy
the
other
hospital
and
get
that
capacity
in
a
consensual
transaction
by
the
authority.
and
here's
my
point,
justice
scalia:
this
case
is
on
all
fours
with
this
court's
decision
in
omni.
the
notion
that
this
may
have
long
been
desired
by
this,
this
special-purpose
entity,
is
totally
irrelevant.
this
--
this
acquisition
was
proposed
to,
considered
by,
and
--
and
approved
by
the
hospital
authority.
and
not
only
that,
when
the
ftc
came
and
complained
about
it,
they
reconvened
another
public
meeting
and
discussed
it
again
and
came
to
the
conclusion
again
that
they
wanted
to
acquire
this
hospital.
and
before
they
signed
the
lease,
they
issued
a
notice
and
comment
period.
there
was
three
months
for
people
to
tell
the
authority
whether
this
lease
was
or
was
not
consistent
with
community
interests.
they
had
a
public
meeting
and
they
approved
it.
and
that
is
the
act
of
the
state.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
i
mean,
this
is
--
the
hospital
authorities
law
says:
counties,
this
is
your
responsibility.
here
are
your
powers.
if
anybody
in
the
state
or
any
competitor
or
the
attorney
general
thinks
that
you
are
abusing
those
statutory
powers,
the
courts
are
open
and
quite
receptive
to
those
concerns.
but
there's
no--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
believe
there
is
any
such
mechanism,
and
i
believe
that
the
--
the
state,
the
legislature,
didn't
contemplate
anything
like
that,
because
the
mandate
and
the
responsibility
and
the
authorization
was
devolved
to
the
counties.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
--
what
the
hospital
authority
could
do
and
did
do,
although
it's
not
in
the
record
of
this
case,
is
evaluate
the
likelihood
of
getting
a
certificate
of
need
to
build
the
additional
required
facilities.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
