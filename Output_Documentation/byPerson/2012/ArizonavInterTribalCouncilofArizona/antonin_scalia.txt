justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
form
should
have
included
the
eligibility
requirements
that
your
state
demands.
and
it
seems
to
me
your
complaint
is
that
the
federal
form
does
not
require
proof
of
citizenship,
unless
you
consider
just
the
statement
that
i'm
a
citizen
to
be
proof
of
citizenship.
but
why
didn't
you
challenge
the
form?
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
my
problem
with
this.
i
frankly
think
that
federal
form
doesn't
make
much
sense
unless
it's
--
unless
it's
to
be
exclusive
for
federal
voting.
and
--
and
why
didn't
you
challenge
the
--
the
refusal
of
the
commission
to
include
on
the
form
as
additional
state
requirements
the
proof
of
citizenship?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
--
you're
simply
denying
then
that
the
federal
government
can,
so
long
as
it
protects
the
requirements
that
your
state
imposes,
you're
--
you're
saying
the
federal
government
cannot
prescribe
a
single
form
for
--
for
voter
registration.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
--
why
can't
it
make
it
exclusive?
let's
assume
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
that
accept
and
--
and
employ,
whatever
the
language
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
--
suppose
i
think
that
that
does
mean
that
it's
supposed
to
be
exclusive.
what
harm
is
there
so
long
as
the
federal
commission
requires
as
part
of
the
federal
form
all
of
the
necessary
proofs
of
--
of
qualification
that
the
state
imposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
did
nothing
more
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
didn't
go
to
court
to
say
you
have
to
include
this
as
one
of
the
state-specific
requirements.
why
didn't
you
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
okay.
why
didn't
he
do
it?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
you
establish
citizenship
without
having
something
mailed
in,
in
addition
to
the
form?
what
are
the
other
state-specific
requirements?
you
have
to
put
down
your
driver's
license
number
or
some
other
numbers?
i
--
i
guess
you
could
--
you
could
make
them
check
off
place
of
birth
and
if
that
place
of
birth
is
not
the
united
states,
you
could
require
them
to
write
down
some
number
of
--
of
their
admission
to
citizenship.
are
there
--
are
there
numbers
that
you
could
demand?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that's
the
kind
of
thing
you
should
have
had
and
that
your
predecessor
should
have
asked
for
to
be
included
in
the
federal
form.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
they're
driving
the
bus
as
to
the
form.
they
can't
drive
it
into
a
ditch.
they're
--
they're
--
they're
subject
to
arbitrary
and
capricious
limitations
just
as
any
other
agency
is.
and
to
allow
louisiana
--
to
include
what
--
what
they've
allowed
in
louisiana
to
include
and
to
say
that
the
only
proof
of
citizenship
--
there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute
which
says
consistent
with
determining,
the
states
being
able
to
determine
the
qualifications.
isn't
there
a
provision
which
makes
it
clear
that
the
federal
form
has
to
make
allowance
for
the
states
determining
the
qualifications?
justice
antonin
scalia
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
form
has
to
enable
the
state
to
do
that.
and
it
seems
to
me
you
were
quite
able
to
argue
that
in
--
in
refusing
to
allow
you
to
include
in
the
--
in
the
federal
form
in
arizona
some
indication
of
proof
of
citizenship
requiring
nothing
else
except
oh,
i'm
a
--
check
off,
i
am
a
citizen,
right?
so
it's
under
oath.
big
deal.
if
--
if
--
if
you're
willing
to
violate
the
voting
laws,
i
suppose
you're
willing
to
violate
the
perjury
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
think
you
should
--
you
should
have
challenged
the
commission's
refusal
to
--
to
place
that
evidence
in
the
federal
form.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
if
i
believed
--
if
i
believed
in
legislative
history,
i
would
find
that
very
persuasive.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
enclosing
your
driver's
license
number
is
that
immense
barrier,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what's
keeping
40
percent
of
eligible
voters
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
still
think
that's
a
relatively
few
number,
and
--
and
if
you
don't
have
the
driver's
license,
then
you
can
use
your
naturalization
certificate.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
say
that
about
any
certification
procedure
that,
now
and
then
there
will
be
a
mistake.
i
mean
the
fact
that
there
is
one
person
where
--
where
the
computer
spit
out
the
wrong
number
or
something,
that
is
the
basis
for
rejecting
the
entire
system
that
arizona
proposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
conclusive
or
can
that
be
challenged?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
they
may
require
it.
it
doesn't
say
they
must
require
it.
so
it
leaves
it
open
to
the
commission,
does
it
not,
to
decline
to
require
some
materials
that
is
necessary
to
enable
the
appropriate
state
election
official
to
assess
eligibility?
isn't
that,
isn't
that
what
the
language
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
means
may.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
no,
we're
talking
about
--
right
now
we
are
talking
about
the
consequences
of
that
language,
not
--
and
the
consequence
of
the
may
is
may.
it
does
not
even
require
the
commission
to
include
within
the
form
everything
that's
necessary
for
the
state
to
determine
eligibility.
now,
why
would
congress
ever
create
such
a
system
where
the
commission
need
not
require
what's
necessary
for
eligibility,
and
nonetheless,
the
state
cannot,
cannot
require
anything
further
than
what
the
commission
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
says
what
you
only
may
require.
it
doesn't
say
what
you
only
shall
require.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
all
that
stuff
required
by
the
vote
america
act?
all
that
stuff?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
the
first
thing
you
mentioned
for
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
rest
is
--
is
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
anything
else
that
they
want.
but
what
is,
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
necessary
to
enable
the
appropriate
state
election
official
to
assess
the
eligibility
of
the
applicant?
it's
clear
that
the
statute
intends
the
states
to
be
able
to
do
that.
and
you
say,
well,
the
--
you
know,
the
commission
has
--
has
required
its
--
its
own
proof
and
the
state
wants
a
different
kind
of
proof.
the
proof
the
commission
requires
is
simply
the
statement,
i'm
a
citizen.
this
is
proof?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
proof
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
oath
is
not
proof
at
all.
it's
just
a
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
srinivasan,
the
problem
that
i
have
with
that
is
that
the
provision
you're
alluding
to
says
that
--
not
that
the
state
shall
--
not
that
the
commission
“
shall
”
require
the
information
necessary
to
enable
the
appropriate
state
election
official
to
assess
eligibility,
but
it
simply
says
that
it
“
may
”
require
only
that
information.
now,
is
it
conceivable
that
congress
intended
that
the
commission
may
not
require
some
information
that
is
necessary
to
enable
the
appropriate
state
election
official
to
assess
eligibility,
but
that
the
state
may
not
require
it
either?
is
that
a
conceivable
disposition
of
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
“
may
require
only
”
means
shall
require
only?
is
that
--
is
that
your
submission?
“
may
require
only
”
means
shall
require
only?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not
be
a
problem
if
the
state
could
require
it.
it
would
not
be
a
problem.
when
--
when
the
commission
fails
to
do
what
enables
the
state
to
assess
qualifications,
the
state'll
do
it.
no
problemo.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
and
since
you
believe
that
“
may
require
only
”
means
“
shall
require
only
”,
in
judicial
review,
a
determination
before
the
--
the
court
would
be
whether
indeed
this
information
is
necessary
to
enable
the
state
to
assess
the
qualifications,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
district
court
here
certainly
thought
that
was
necessary.
so
you're
going
to
be
in
--
in
bad
shape
--
the
government
is
going
to
be
--
the
next
time
somebody
does
challenge
the
commission
determination
in
court
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
got
to
stop
saying
the
commission
approved
of
it.
2-2
is
not
approving.
you
could
say
the
commission
was
unable
to
disapprove
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
national
voter
registration
act
of
1993
requires
states
to
“accept
and
use,”
that's
the
crucial
language
here,
a
uniform
federal
form
to
register
voters
for
federal
elections.
the
federal
form
developed
by
the
election
assistance
commission
requires
that
an
applicant
aver
under
penalty
of
perjury
that
he
is
a
citizen.
the
federal
form
does
not
require
however
any
concrete
evidence
of
citizenship.
arizona
law
does.
it
requires
voter
registration
officials
to
reject
any
application
for
registration
including
a
federal
form
that
is
not
accompanied
by
documentary
evidence
of
citizenship.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
arizona's
requirement
as
applied
to
federal
form
applicants
is
preempted
by
the
federal
act's
mandate
and
state's
accept
and
use
of
the
federal
form.
arizona
argues
that
accept
and
use
requires
only
that
a
state
“willingly
receive”
the
federal
form
and
use
it
in
some
way
not
that
it
be
deemed
conclusive
of
valid
registration.
that
is
certainly
a
possible
meaning
of
accept,
a
merchant's
notice
that
he
will
accept
visa
credit
cards
does
not
mean
that
he
will
not
require
in
addition
personal
identification.
but
reading
except
merely
to
require
willing
receipt
seems
out
of
place
in
the
context
of
an
official
mandate
to
accept
something
for
a
given
purpose.
imagine
for
example
a
government
diktat
that
civil
servants
shall
accept
government
ious
for
payment
of
salaries.
that
command
certainly
does
not
invite
the
response,
“sure,
we'll
accept
ious
if
you
pay
us
a
10%
down
payment
in
cash.”
the
implication
of
a
mandate
to
accept
is
that
that
object
is
to
be
accepted
as
sufficient
for
the
requirement
it
is
meant
to
satisfy.
here,
the
requirement
of
registration.
many
other
federal
statutes
impose
and
accept
requirement
that
obviously
bears
this
meaning.
arizona's
reading
is
also
difficult
to
reconcile
with
other
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
--
the
voting
registration
act
as
we
explained
in
detail
in
our
opinion.
in
some,
the
act
forbids
states
to
demand
that
an
applicant
submit
additional
information
beyond
that
required
by
the
federal
form.
we
add
an
important
caveat
however
the
act
does
not
prevents
states
from
denying
registration
based
on
any
information
in
their
possession
establishing
the
applicant's
ineligibility.
arizona
seeks
to
vindicate
its
reading
of
the
statute
by
invoking
the
canon
of
construction
that
statutory
ambiguities
should
be
resolved
in
a
fashion
that
avoids
constitutional
doubt.
the
constitution,
arizona
rightly
points
out,
empowers
congress
to
regulate
how
federal
elections
are
held
but
with
a
few
exceptions
not
relevant
here,
does
not
permit
congress
to
regulate
who
may
vote
in
federal
elections.
determining
what
qualifications
of
voter
must
possess
is
the
province
of
the
states.
arizona
is
correct
that
it
would
raise
serious
constitutional
doubts
if
a
federal
statute
prevented
a
state
from
obtaining
the
information
necessary
to
enforce
its
voter
qualifications.
but
to
avoid
these
doubts,
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
accept
and
use
a
meaning
that
allows
arizona
to
deny
the
sufficiency
of
the
federal
form.
at
oral
argument,
the
united
states
expressed
the
view
that
one
section
of
the
statute
requires
the
election
assistance
commission.
you
remember
them
there
that
people
that
design
the
form,
requires
the
election
assistance
commission
to
include
on
the
federal
form
information
“necessary
to
enable
the
appropriate
state
election
official
to
assess
the
eligibility
of
the
applicant.”
we
need
not
consider
whether
the
statute
requires
that.
it
is
enough
that
the
executive
has
discretionary
authority
to
apply
it
that
way
in
order
to
avoid
serious
constitutional
doubt.
one
further
elaboration,
the
voter
registration
act
provides
that
any
state
may
ask
the
commission
to
include
state
specific
instructions
on
the
federal
form,
and
the
commission
has
done
that
for
some
other
states.
if
the
commission
rejects
such
a
request
or
fails
to
act
upon
it,
a
state
may
seek
judicial
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
that
alternative
means
of
enforcing
its
constitutional
power
to
determine
voting
qualifications
remains
open
to
arizona
here.
if
arizona
makes
a
request
and
the
commission
does
not
approve
it,
arizona
would
have
the
opportunity
to
establish
in
a
reviewing
court
that
requiring
affirmance
of
citizenship
on
a
mere
affirmance
of
citizenship
on
pain
of
perjury
will
not
suffice
to
effectuate
its
citizenship
requirement.
if
that
is
so,
the
commission
would
be
under
a
nondiscretionary
duty
to
include
arizona's
concrete
evidence
requirement
on
the
federal
form.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
alito
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
