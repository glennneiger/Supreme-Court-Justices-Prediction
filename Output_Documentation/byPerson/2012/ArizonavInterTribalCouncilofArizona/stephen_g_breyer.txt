justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
ask
a
different
--
can
i
ask--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
probably
a
perfectly
good
answer
to
this,
but
i
--
i
notice
that
in
this
federal
law
in
7(b),
it
says
what
the
registration
form
shall
contain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
there
are
four
subsections
and
only
one
of
those
refers
to
a
particular
thing,
and
that
is,
identifying
information.
it
shall
include
a
statement,
including
citizenship,
saying
--
that
contains
an
attestation
the
applicant
meets
that
requirement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
under
perjury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
that.
then
i
look
at
the
arizona
law
and
it
says
in
arizona,
you
have
to
include
like
in
immigration,
you
know,
a
passport,
a
birth
certificate,
and
then
you
have
a
couple
of
other
things
that
show
you're
a
citizen,
correct?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
okay.
that's
not
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying
given
these
five
or
six
specific
things--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
show
you're
a
citizen--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
use
does
arizona
make
of
that
attestation
under
perjury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
say
it
wasn't.
i
just
want
to
know,
since
you
have
right
in
front
of
you
a
birth
certificate
or
the
equivalent,
what
use
are
you
making
of
the
federal
provision
that's
there
in
the
form:
i
am
a
citizen.
what
use
are
you
making
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know
--
i'm
sure
you
are
and
then
my
question
is
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
his
point
is,
he
keeps
making
the
point,
your
colleague,
and
he
says,
no,
that
isn't
what
it
says.
what
the
statute
says
is
it
may
require
only
such
identifying
information
as
is
necessary
to
assess
eligibility.
in
other
words,
it's
telling
the
people
who
write
the
form
what
they
can
put
on
it.
and
they
can't
put
other
things
on
it.
but
it
nowhere
says
that
the
state
can't
do
other
things.
now
that's
his
point.
and
when
i
asked
him,
well,
how
are
you
--
how
are
you
using
--
you
have
to
be
able
to
use,
oh,
he
says,
we
use
it.
we
use
the
citizen
part
and
these
things
on
the
form
to
prosecute
people
for
perjury.
so
we're
doing
what
it
says,
we're
using
it
and
it
doesn't
say
we
can't
add
a
few
other
things.
okay.
now,
that's
his
argument.
now,
your
answer,
which
would
be
very
helpful
to
me,
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
the
form.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
his
problem
is
how
do
you
get
to
that
conclusion?
he
says
you
can't
get
there
from
the
language
because
the
language
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
what
the
commission
can
put
on
the
form.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
some
other
agency,
such
as
a
state
or
sovereign,
can
add
something.
now,
that's
his
problem.
and
i
would
like
to
hear
very
succinctly,
the
reason
he
is
wrong
about
that
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
26h.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
you're
going
is
this,
as
i
heard
you
before:
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
specific
language
saying
the
state
can't
do
this,
can't
add
things.
but
it
does
make
a
huge
point
approving
citizenship
in
a
particular
way
on
the
form.
what
would
the
point
of
that
be
if
the
state
could
add
things?
so
we
must
look
back
to
the
purpose,
not
necessarily
exclusively
the
language,
of
deciding
what
that
particular
provision
b,
in
particularly
one
as
you
quote
adding
to,
what
could
it
have
been?
and
there
the
legislative
history
in
my
view
is
helpful
because
it
makes
clear,
for
example,
in
at
least
one
place
that
congress
did
think
they
shouldn't
add
a
provision
that
allows
the
state
to
do
just
what
it's
doing
here
because
that
wouldn't
be
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act.
so
i'm
putting
words
in
your
mouth
but
don't
accept
them
because
i
put
them
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
grand
--
to
go
back
to
your
--
i
see
that
as
your
grand
purpose.
that's
the
grand
purpose
argument.
and
then
there
is
the
subsidiary
purpose
argument,
which
you
started
to
make,
which
i
wanted
to
hear,
which
has
to
do
with
(b).
it
says
may
require
only
such
identifying
information.
so
i
thought,
well,
they
could
require
less,
less
than
what's
necessary.
they
could.
it
says
you
can't
require
more.
they
could
require
less.
but
suppose
they
put
a
statement
in
and
they
say,
in
respect
to
this
qualification,
nothing
to
do
with
citizenship:
this
is
what
is
necessary.
no
more.
but
we've
done
everything
that
is
necessary.
then
could
a
state
come
along
and
say,
we
think
more
is
necessary?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it's
the
word
“
necessary
”
that
you
thought
--
that
that
would
be
dependent
upon?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
know
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
not
quite
--
the
last
step
of
what
i
wanted
you
to
think
of
was
this--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it
does
say
“
may
require
only
”--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--“
that
which
is
necessary
”.
so
if
they
said
--
and
this
what
is
necessary.
fine.
pretty
tough
for
the
state
to
say
i'm
going
to
add
some
things.
but
the
very
next
subsection
does
use
the
words
“
shall
include
”.
so
i
wonder
--
and
that
has
to
do
with
citizenship.
so
i
wonder
if
that
is
a
statement
by
congress
that
in
respect
to
citizenship,
that
is
what
is
necessary.
