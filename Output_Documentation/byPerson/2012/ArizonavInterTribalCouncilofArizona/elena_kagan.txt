but,
general
horne,
wouldn't
it
contradict
it
if
instead
of
saying
well,
we'd
like
you
to
offer
identification,
saying,
well,
we'd
like
you
also
to
have
a
paper
ticket.
justice
elena
kagan
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
accept
and
use
language,
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
have
done
something
to
the
federal
form,
and
that
essentially
creates
a
new
set
of
requirements
and
a
new
form.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
you
could
have
said,
you
know,
we
have
our
own
state
form
which
we're
allowed
to
have
under
the
statute.
anybody
who
requires
the
federal
form
has
to
append
the
state
form
as
well.
could
you
have
done
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
do
we
draw
the
line?
where
does
the
line
get
drawn
between
adding
just
your
own
form,
and
adding
a
new
set
of
requirements,
which,
you
know,
you
could
just
as
easily
have
called
a
form?
justice
elena
kagan
but
--
but,
general,
doesn't
the
--
the
statute
make
the
eac
the
decisionmaker
with
respect
to
what
can
be
added
to
the
federal
form?
the
federal
form
--
form,
you're
exactly
right,
sets
a
floor.
but
if
you
look
at
section
7,
what
section
7
does
is
to
say
the
eac
gets
to
decide
the
minimum
necessary
and
it
consults
with
the
states
and
the
states
can
come
to
it
and
tell
it
what
it
needs
and
the
eac
can
take
action.
but
the
eac
is
driving
the
bus,
according
to
section
7
of
this
statute.
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
a
little
bit
confused.
justice
elena
kagan
general,
could
i
take
you
back
to
this
distinction
that
you're
making.
you
said
you
can't
append
an
additional
form,
you
can't
use
an
additional
form,
but
you
can
require
additional
information.
justice
elena
kagan
so
how
do
--
what's
the
difference
between
requiring
additional
information
and
requiring
an
additional
form?
isn't
--
when
you
say
you
need
information
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
that's
just
a
form,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
what
is
the
--
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
requiring
a
federal
form
if
you
could
just
say,
and
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
to
give
ten
more
items
of
information?
i
mean,
then
the
federal
form
just
becomes
another
hoop
to
jump
through.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
millett,
i
mean,
suppose
it
were
true
that
the
eac
has
been
inconsistent
in
this
respect.
that
would
be
a
different
kind
of
lawsuit.
