mr.
thomas
c.
horne
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
nvra
should
not
be
construed
to
preempt
arizona's
proposition
200
for
three
reasons.
first,
prohibiting
a
state
from
effectively
enforcing
the
citizenship
requirement
is
so
far-reaching
that
if
congress
had
intended
that,
it
would
have
put
the
prohibition
in
the
statute
expressly,
which
it
did
not
do.
congressional
silence
should
not
disable
states
from
taking
sensible
precautions
to
exclude
noncitizens
from
voting.
second,
when
congress
wanted
to
expressly
prohibit
something,
it
knew
how
to
do
it.
it
expressly
prohibited
notarization
and
other
forms
of
authentication.
this
court
has
frequently
held
that
statutory
language
that
indicates
--
that
prohibits
one
thing
indicates
there's
no
other
implicit
prohibition:
the
expressio
unius
rule.
third,
proposition
200
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
nvra,
because
the
purpose
of
the
nvra--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
--
simplifying
the
procedure
is
one
of
two
important
purposes
of
the
nvra.
the
other
is
the
integrity
of
the
system--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
neither
takes
precedence
over
the
other.
they're
both
equally
important.
and
so--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--your
honor,
i
think
the
question
is,
if
you
take
the
two
purposes
together,
does
--
does
the
proposition
200
strongly
fulfill
one
and
have
a
minimal
burden
on
the
other?
and,
your
honor,
i
would
rely
on
the
findings
of
the
--
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
in
fact,
this
court
instructed
the
ninth
circuit
to
defer
to
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
in
the
purcell
case,
which
was
this
case
in
an
earlier
stage.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
because,
your
honor,
the
--
the
congress
did
not
specify
what
the
states
could
or
could
not
do.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
this
statute
does
not
say
the
signature
is
the
only
thing
that
the
states
can
use
to
verify
the
eligibility
of
the
applicant.
now,
in
--
in
using
the
term
“
accept
and
use
”,
your
honor,
accept
and
use
in
ordinary
language
--
we've
given
lots
of
examples
in
our
briefs
--
one
can
accept
and
use
a
form
for
a
particular
purpose
without
that
form
being
sufficient
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
i
came
here
from
arizona
on
an
airplane.
if
the
airline
said
we
accept
and
use
an
e-mail
ticket,
you
don't
need
to
bring
a
paper
ticket.
and
then
i
got
there
and
they
said,
we
want
to
see
identification
to
prove
that
you
are
who
you
say
you
are,
that
would
not
contradict
the
statement
that
they
are
accepting
and
using
the
e-ticket.
they
are
accepting
and
using
the
e-ticket
for
a
specific
purpose--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--yes,
your
honor.
if
they--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
i
take
that
analogy
to
our
--
to
our
facts,
if
we
had
changed
the
federal
form,
i
think
we
would
have
been
in
violation.
but
we
did
not
change
the
federal
form.
we
used
the
federal
form
exactly
as
it's
printed
by
the
federal
government.
and
we--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--your
honor,
we
--
we
accept
and
use
the
federal
form.
we
ask
in
addition
to
that
for
evidence
that
the
person
is
a
citizen,
that
they're
eligible
to
vote.
the
form
is
not
exclusive.
the
form
does
not
bind
us
to
use
only
the
form
and
nothing
else.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
would
have
been
contrary
to
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
act.
i
think
what
we
did
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
act.
but
if
you--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--because
the
statute
contemplates
that
it
--
that
it
is
the
burden
of
the
states
to
determine
the
eligibility
of
the
voters.
the
--
the
eac
was
given
the
duty
to
develop
the
form,
and
we
don't
argue
with
the
fact
that
the
form
belongs
to
the
eac.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
under
section
6(a)(1)
of
the
statute,
the
burden
of
determining
whether
the
citizen
is
eligible
rests
with
the
state.
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--the
form
belongs
to
the
eac.
the
determination
of
whether
the
applicant
is
eligible
belongs
to
us.
so
whether
or
not
they
put
what
--
what
we're
asking
for
on
the
form
doesn't
matter.
we
are
fulfilling
our
duty
under
section
6(a)(1)
by
determining
the
eligibility
of
the
applicant
by
asking
for
additional
evidence
of
citizenship.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
the
federal
government
can
prescribe
the
form,
but
the
form
is
not
exclusive.
the
responsibility
to
determine
the
eligibility--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--accept
and
use.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
form
is
--
cannot
be
exclusive.
i
mean,
even
the
itca
respondent
and
the
united
states
respondent
admit
that
we
can
look
to
external
evidence
to
determine
whether
the
voter
is
eligible.
the
argument
is,
they
say
we
can
look
at
external
evidence,
but
we
can't
ask
the
applicant
himself,
who
has
the
most
information,
to
pull
out
his
driver's
license
and
write
down
a
number.
there's
no--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--we
did,
your
honor,
and
the
commission
itself
took
no
action.
the
executive
director
rejected
our
request.
the
executive
director
has
no
power
to
make
determinations.
congress
explicitly
stated
that
the
eac
can
act
only
by
a
vote
of
three
out
of
four
of
its
members.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
that
--
that
was
under
a
predecessor
of
mine,
so
i
don't
know
the
reason.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
would
be
competent
to
answer
for
him,
your
honor.
but
i
think
--
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
because
the
form
is
--
is
one
thing
that
we
accept
and
use
to
determine
the
eligibility
of
the
voter,
but
it's
not
the
only
thing.
my
friends
on
the
other
side--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
position
that
the
executive
director
took,
that
if
the
form
is
fully
filled
out
and
on
its
face
it
shows
the
person
is
qualified
we
must
accept
the
application.
we
then
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
that
would
mean
that
even
if
we
had
documentary
proof
that
the
person
was
not
a
citizen,
we'd
still
have
to
accept
the
application.
in
response
to
that,
the
respondent
itca
and
the
federal
government
said:
no,
you
can
look
at
external
evidence
if
it
shows
that
the
person
is
not
a
citizen.
so
the
only
question
remaining
then
is
there
any
basis
in
the
statute
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
our
looking
to
external
evidence
that
we
have
and
our
asking
the
applicant
to
write
down
a
--
a
number
from
his
driver's
license.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
if
that
were
consistent
with
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
act
we
could,
your
honor.
and
in
determining
that,
one
would
have
to
weigh
our
interest
in
the
integrity
of
the
system
versus
what
burdens
that
places
on
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--your
honor,
the
federal
form
sets
forth
certain
minimum
requirements
that
--
that
have
to
be
met.
in
fact,
the
--
the
act
says
specifically
in
section
7(b)(2)
that
they
must
ask
for
the
signature
under
oath
of
the
applicant.
the
federal
form
also
provides
under
7(a)(1)
that
additional
things
that
are
necessary
to
determine
the
eligibility
of
the
applicant
can
also
be
put
on
the
form.
the
eac
chose
not
to
put
anything
additional
on
the
form,
which
was
their
right.
it
was
permissive.
but
they
did
set
--
set
up
a
system
of
state-specific
requirements.
i
think
that
reflects
the
fact
that
the
states
have
the
burden
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
eligible
--
the
applicant
is
eligible.
that's
--
that's
our
burden.
we
must
accept
and
use
the
federal
form
as
a
tool
in
doing
that,
but
it
is
not
the
exclusive
tool,
and
my
friends
on
the
other
side
have
admitted
that
it's
not
the
exclusive
tool,
because
they've
admitted
that
if
we
have
documentary
evidence
the
person
is
not
a
citizen,
we
can
reject
the
application.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
well,
some
states
require
the
social
security
number--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--which
is
not
--
which
is
not
provided
for
in
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
but
the
--
but
it's
not
prohibited.
and
the
states
were
held
in
--
in
the
cases
that
were
brought
under
that,
the
states
were
held
that
they
could
add
it
because
it's
not
prohibited.
the
state
of
louisiana
--
inconsistently
on
the
part
of
the
eac,
the
state
of
louisiana
has
a
requirement
that
was
approved
by
the
eac
and
is
in
the
form
that
says,
"if
the
applicant
has
neither
a
louisiana
driver's
license,
a
louisiana
special
identification
card
or
a
social
security
number,
the
applicant
shall
attach
one
of
the
following
items
to
his
application:
a
copy
of
a
current
and
valid
photo
identification,
a
copy
of
a
current
utility
bill,
bank
statement,
government
check,
paycheck
or
other
government
document.
"
so--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--your
honor,
the
federal
form
is
not
exclusive.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
the
eac
is
driving
the
bus
as
to
the
form,
but
the
states
are
driving
the
bus
as
to
what
is
necessary
to
determine
the
ultimate--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
--
and
the
--
but
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--the
--
the
duty
of
the
states,
your
honor,
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
voter
is
eligible,
that
is
a
duty
that
rests
with
the
state,
not
with
the
eac.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
the
eac
can
only--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
the
federal
form
is
--
is
a
tool
that
we
have
to
use
to
determine
the
eligibility
of
the
voter,
but
the
ultimate
responsibility
under
--
under
section
6(a)(1)
of
--
of
this
very
act
is
with
the
states
to
determine
the
eligibility
of
the
voter.
my
friends
on
the
other
side
are
admitting
that
the
--
that
we're
not
stuck
with
the
four
corners
of
the
form,
because
--
because
we've
pointed
out
that
would
result
in
a
ridiculous
conclusion
that
we
could
have
documentary
proof
that
the
person
is
not
eligible.
so
if
we're
not
bound
by
the
four
corners
of
the
form,
as
in
the
ordinary
use
of
the
term
“
accept
and
use
”,
we
accept
and
use
the
form
for
a
specific
purpose,
but
it
does
--
it
is
not
sufficient
to
satisfy
that
purpose.
all
parties
agree
to
that.
the
only
question
is,
is
there
a
distinction
which
we
do
not
find
in
the
statute
between
using
external
evidence
that
we
already
have
and
asking
someone
to
write
down
the
--
the
number
on
his
driver's
license,
which
he
is
the
one
that
has
the
most
information.
it's
the
logical
way
to
do
it.
in
fact,
there
is
no
federal
register
of
american
citizens.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
there
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
draw
a
distinction
between
our
having
other
extrinsic
evidence,
which
they
agree
we
can
use
outside
of
the
form
and
our
asking
people
to
say,
write
down--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--yes,
but
--
but
they
don't
make
the
form
exclusive.
congress
could
have
said
the
form
is
exclusive
and
you
can't
ask
for
anything
else.
they
didn't
do
that.
and
they
had
shown
when
they
dealt
with
authentication
that
they
knew
how
to
prohibit
something
if
they
wanted
to
prohibit
it.
they
chose
not
to
prohibit
this
exclusively
and
--
and
so
therefore,
it
rests
with
the
states--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
if
the
--
if
the
legislative
history
were
consistent,
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
was
an
argument
that
could
be
made.
but
the
legislative
history
her
is
extremely
self-contradictory
and
one
cannot
conclude
from
any
part
of
that
legislative
history
what
was
the
intent
of
the
majority
of
the
congress.
the
house
committee
which
dealt
with
the
very
act
that
--
that
we
have
said:
"only
the
elected
officials
designated
and
authorized
under
state
law
are
charged
with
responsibility
to
enroll
eligible
voters
on
the
list
of
voters.
"
"the
nvra
should
not
be
interpreted
in
any
way
to
supplant
that
authority.
"
"the
committee
is
particularly
interested
in
ensuring
that
election
officials
continue
to
make
determinations
as
to
applicants'
eligibility
such
as
citizenship
as
they're
made
under
current
law
and
practice.
"
and
the
fec,
which
is
a
predecessor
to
the
eac,
relying
on
that
house
committee
report,
said
that
an
application
received
by
a
local
voter
registration
official
is
only
an
application
and
be
subject
to
whatever
verification
procedures
are
currently
applied
to
all
applications.
in
addition,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
could
i
just
add
one
quick
point,
and
that
is
that
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
was
opposed
to
that
amendment
in
conference
committee,
saying
it
wasn't
necessary,
that
the
states
could
already
verify
applicants
under
the
existing
law
as
it
was
written
before
that
amendment.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
those
are
very
unusual.
normally,
you
just
write
down
the
number
from
your
driver's
license.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
okay,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
well,
there
have
been
--
actually,
there
have
been
prosecutions
for
perjury,
your
honor.
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
at
all
a
verification
of
the
eligibility
of
the
citizen
because--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--well,
your
honor,
we
are
making
use
of
it
and
i
just
mentioned--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--by
prosecuting
--
there
have
been
ten
prosecutions
in
one
year
alone
of
people
who
swore
falsely.
out
of
the
hundreds
that
were
caught
swearing
falsely,
ten
in
fact
were
prosecuted.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
but
that
--
but
that
is
not
a
--
that
is
not
a
sufficient
use
or
that
is
not
a
sufficient
measure
of
determining
eligibility,
because
literally
hundreds
have
been
caught
swearing
jury
--
jury
commissioner
forms
swearing
they
are
not
citizens
after
they
had
already
registered
to
vote.
other
people
were
caught
in
their
applications
to
citizenship
when
they
checked
and
found
that
they
had
previously
registered
to
vote
and
voted.
so
--
so
we
are
making
use
of
it,
but
it
is
not
a
--
it
is
not
a
functional
way
to
determine
eligibility.
and
in
7(a)(1),
congress
said
that
--
that
both
the
federal
form
and
the
state
form
as
incorporated
under
section
4
may
ask
for
such
additional
information,
only
such
additional
information
as
is
necessary
to
determine
the
eligibility
of
the
voter.
that
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
prohibit
us
from
getting
additional
information
as
is
necessary
to
determine
the
eligibility
of
the
voter.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
a
form.
it's
--
it's
an
instruction
to
--
to
write
down
on
the
federal
form
a
number.
and
there
is
--
item
six
on
the
federal
form
has
a
block
where
you
write
down
the
number
and
if
you
don't
have
either
number
--
you
can
write
down
a
--
a
driver's
license,
you
can
write
down
a
naturalization
number,
you
can
write
down
an
indian
tribal
identification
number.
if
you
don't
have
any
of
those
numbers,
then
you
can
send
in
one
of
these
additional
documents.
but
that
is
not
an
additional
form.
the
reason
--
the
distinction
i
draw
between
the
--
incorporating
another
form
or
the
state
form
and
asking
for
additional
information
is
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
act.
the
act
indicates
that
the
state
form
is
an
alternative
to
the
federal
form,
but
cannot
take
its
place.
so
i'm
saying
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
purpose
and
objectives
of
the
act
to
attach
the
form,
but
it
is
consistent--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
first
of
all
--
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
federal
form
does
provide
minimums.
you
must
--
you
must
answer
the
questions
set
forth
in
the
federal
form.
but
secondly,
to
the
extent
we
add
things
to
the
federal
form,
those
things
must
be
consistent
with
the
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
act.
and
i
--
and
i
--
and
i
justify
my
assertion
that
prop
200
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
and
objectives
of
the
act
by
relying
on
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
that
relate
exactly
to
that
question,
finding
that
it
was
a
minimal
burden,
overcome
by
a
major
interest
that
the
state
has
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
system,
where
the
--
where
the
trial
judge
found
a
lot
of
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
voter
fraud
going
on,
although
not
the
fault
of
the
individuals,
the
fault
of
the
organizations
that
often
fool
people
into
signing
the
form
when
they
don't
intend
to
or
they
don't
intend
to
break
the
law;
but
as
--
but
as
against
that,
that
the
--
that
the
burdens
are
minimal.
and
the
trial
court,
the
district
court,
had
a
lot
of
findings
justifying
the
statement
that
the
burdens
are
minimal,
including
the
fact,
for
example,
that
if
all
the
rejected
forms
had
been
accepted,
the
increase
in
hispanic
registration
would
have
only
have
been.1
percent,
which
is
statistically
insignificant,
including
the
fact
that
out
of
a
population
of
$6
million,
the
plaintiffs,
who
have
all
the
resources
one
can
imagine
if
you
look
at
the
list
of
plaintiffs,
could
only
find
one
person
out
of
six
million
people
that
could
not
satisfy
--
who
was
entitled
to
vote,
who
could
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
act;
and
a
lot
of
other
findings
by
the
trial
court.
and
this
court
instructed
the
ninth
circuit
to
give
deference
to
the
factual
findings
of
the
trial
court
in
the
purcell
case,
and
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
that.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
if
you
look
at
the
factual
findings
of
the
trial
court,
our
position
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
and
objectives
of
the
act.
and
i'd
like
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--could
i
reserve
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
the
qualification
has,
but
our
--
our
objection
to
the
ninth
circuit
decision
preempting
proposition
200
is
that
it
leaves
us
unable
to
enforce
our
qualification
requirement,
which
under
the
constitution
clearly
is
a
state
function.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
it's
extremely
inadequate,
your
honor.
it's
essentially
an
honor
system.
it
does
not
do
the
job.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
that's
what
they
decided
as
a
minimum
in
the
federal
form,
but
they
did
not
say
that
we
could
not
ask
for
additional
information.
congress
could
have
said
that,
just
as
they
said
we
can't
ask
for
notarization.
they
chose
not
to
say
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
we
have
to
accept
and
use
the
form
and
we
can't
change
the
form,
but
we
can
ask
for
additional
evidence
to
perform
our
function
of
determining
that
citizens--
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
your
honor,
incidentally,
there
have
been
references
to
a
postcard.
the
eac
itself
says
put
the
form
in
an
envelope.
and
--
and
just
as
you
put
the
form
in
an
envelope,
you
can
put
a
copy
of
your
birth
certificate
in
an
envelope.
but
i
would
point
out
under
crawford
v.
marion
county,
the
holding
in
this
case,
if
there's
a
minimal
burden
on
the
great
majority
of
the
people
and
a
somewhat
higher
burden
on
a
few
people,
that
does
not
negate
the
interests
of
the
state
and
the
integrity
of
the
system.
may
i
reserve
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
horne
thank
you,
your
honor,
and
i'll
apologize
in
advance
for
talking
really
quickly.
the
--
my
friend
says
in
discussing
section
7(b)(1)
that
it
would
not
be
rational
to
require
only
the
signature.
but
that's
exactly
what
they
did.
all
they
required
was
the
signature,
and
7(b)(1)
has
nothing
to
do
with
that;
7(b)(2)
requires
a
signature.
so
what
the
eac
chose
to
do
under
7(b)(1)
was
exactly
nothing,
zero,
which
--
which
emphasizes
the
point
that
this
is
the
responsibility
of
the
states,
and
that's
how
they
understood
it.
with
respect
to
the
license
having
--
we
cited
ara
section
28-3173,
an
arizona
statute
in
our
reply
brief
that
provides
that
you
--
you
must
renew
every
12
years.
so
by
2004,
the
problem
that
my
friend
spoke
about
was
completely
erased.
everybody
had
a
new
license
which
would
be
sufficient
for
this
purpose,
100
percent.
they
admit
that
we
can
reject
applications
by
reference
to
other
--
by
reference
to
other
documentation
but
they
try
to
draw
a
distinction
between
that
and
asking
the
person
to
write
down
the
driver's
license
number.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
justifies
that
distinction.
a
reference
to
criminal
history
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there
is
a
distinction
with
respect
to
citizenship
between
looking
at
other
documents
and
asking
the
person
for
their
driver's
license
numbers.
in
both
cases
it's
something
outside
of
the
form
and
they
have
admitted
we
can
go
outside
the
form.
with
respect
to
legislative
history,
your
honor,
i
think
the
key
thing
--
mr.
justice
breyer,
in
your
question
was,
it's
only
in
one
place.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
places
that
go
the
other
way.
so
we
cannot
conclude
from
that
one
place
what
the
majority
of
congress
expected.
with
respect
to
hava,
in
hava,
the
congress
had
another
opportunity
to
expressly
state
that
the
state
could
not
look
to
external
evidence
and
ask
for
additional
evidence,
and
they
chose
not
to
do
that.
and
so
i
would
say
that
hava
is
further
evidence
that
congress
was
not
choosing
to
prohibit
us
from
asking
for
additional
information
to
fulfill
our
function,
if
it's
necessary,
of
being
sure
that
the
applicant
is
eligible
to
vote.
with
respect
to
the
siebold
case,
the
court
in
siebold
specifically
said
there
will
be
no
preemption
unless
there
is
a
direct
conflict
and
only
to
the
extent
of
that
conflict,
and
in
that
connection
--
one
last
sentence,
your
honor
--
if
there
are
two
plausible
interpretations,
ordinary
principles
of
federalism
say
one
should
not
choose
the
interpretation
that
results
in
preemption,
and
the
same
thing
applies
with
respect
to
the
canon
of
constitutional
accordance.
thank
you,
your
honor.
