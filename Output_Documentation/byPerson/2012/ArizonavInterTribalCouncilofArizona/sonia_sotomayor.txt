if
i
see
the
purpose
of
the
nvra
to
simplify
registration--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--how
is
arizona's
provisions
consistent
with
that
objective
and
purpose--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--given
that
some
of
the
amici
explain
that
many
people
don't
have
the
documents
that
arizona
requires?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
why
does
one
take
precedence
over
another?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
something
you
do
conflicts
with
one
of
those
purposes,
why
isn't
it
preempted
by
the
federal
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
would
you
think
that
congress,
in
doing
the
short
form
registration,
didn't
consider
the
issue
of
fraud,
and
decide
that
it
had
arrived
at
the
balance
it
wanted?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
a
--
i
have
a
hugely
great
difficulty,
which
is,
the
nvra
says
that
people
can
mail
in
this
form.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know
how
your
rejection
of
the
mail-in,
how
you're
accepting
and
using
it
when
you're
refusing
to
register
someone
when
they
do
exactly
what
the
federal
law
permits
them
to
do:
mail
it
in.
there
--
there's
--
i
don't
--
i
have
a
real
big
disconnect
with
how
you
can
be
saying
you're
accepting
and
using,
when
you're
not
registering
people
when
they
use
it
the
way
the
federal
law
permits
them
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
some
of
us
have
--
do
believe
in
legislative
history.
some
of
my
colleagues
don't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
but
at
least
one
of--
[laughter]
did
he
point
to
himself?
one
of
the
concurring
judges
below
said
that
he
found
the
statute
ambiguous,
but
that
with
the
--
the
legislative
history
there
just
could
be
no
conclusion
but
that
congress
rejected
your
reading.
legislation
history
is
very
clear
that
this
issue
of
what
states
could
add
to
the
form
was
raised
and
permission
to
do
so
was
proposed
explicitly
and
rejected.
how
do
you
--
assuming
that
i
believe
in
legislative
history,
don't
argue
to
me
that
i
shouldn't,
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
get
around
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
general--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
still
having
a
problem.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
both
the
federal
law
and
the
state
law
require
an
individual
to
be
a
citizen.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
basic
qualification.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
both
agree
that
that's
essential.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
fit
in
the
question
of
what
documents
you
use
to
prove
that
with
establishing
the
qualification?
meaning
citizenship,
you
either
have
it
or
you
don't.
that's
why
the
federal
form
says
are
you
or
aren't
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there's
--
that
qualification
has
been
set
by
arizona
and
the
federal
system.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
have
proof,
there
are
people
that
you
have
rejected
even
without
these
forms?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
what
the
federal
system
decided
was
enough.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
you
admit
that
it
doesn't
let
you
add
things.
you
have
to
accept
and
use
that
form.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
go
back
to
justice
kagan.
if
you
don't
have
a
driver's
license
to
put
a
number
down--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--this
list
of
things
says
you
have
to
append
to
the
form
other
items:
a
copy
of
your
birth
certificate,
a
copy
of
your
naturalization
certificate.
why
isn't
that
just
creating
another
form?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
ms.
millett,
i
want
to
give
up--
