could
you
also
ask
for
an
address,
for
proof
of
the
address
or
proof
of
date
of
birth?
justice

but
then
again,
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
form,
as
some
of
my
colleagues
have
indicated,
is
not
worth
very
much.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
--
i
take
it
that
--
that
counsel
on
--
on
--
on
the
other
side
will
disagree
with
that
and
they
say,
well,
this
is
--
this
is
the
line
to
be
drawn.
the
--
the
postcard
is
presumptive
evidence
of
registration
and
--
and
of
qualification.
and
if
you
have
evidence
to
the
contrary,
then
it's
different.
but
otherwise,
the
whole
utility
of
the
single
form
is
missing
--
is
gone.
justice
anthony

other
than
the
statutory
words
that
authorize
the
use
of
the
form.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there's
a
different
preemption
test
under
--
for
this
law
under
this
constitutional
provision
than
there
is
under
the
supremacy
clause.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
ignores
the
proposition
that
the
state
has
a
very
strong
and
vital
interest
in
the
integrity
of
its
elections,
even
when
those,
and
perhaps
especially
when
those
are
elections
of
federal
officials.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
ninth
circuit's
new
test
did
not
give
sufficient
weight
to
that
interest.
