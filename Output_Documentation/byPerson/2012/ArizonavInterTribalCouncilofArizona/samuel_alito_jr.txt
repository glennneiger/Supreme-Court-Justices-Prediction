the
statute--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
statute
says
that
arizona
must
accept
and
use
the
federal
form.
what
does
that
mean?
let
me
give
you
two
possible
definitions:
one,
the
person
must
be
registered
if
the
federal
form
is
properly
completed
and
submitted;
two,
the
state
may
not
make
any
further
inquiry
of
the
person
who
submits
the
form.
maybe
you
have
other
definitions,
but
what
is
the
--
what
do
you
interpret
“
accept
and
use
”
to
mean?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
this
example--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--a
person
rides
up
to
a
place
to
register
on
a
bicycle
and
gets
out
and
hands
in
the
federal
form.
this
boy
looks
like
he
is
13
years
old
and
he
is
carrying
school
books,
he
is
wearing
a
middle
school
t-shirt,
but
he
has
filled
out
the
form
properly.
are
they
required
to
register
him
or
can
they
ask
him,
could
you
show
me
some
proof
of
age,
like
he
would
have
to
if
he
tried
to
buy
alcohol
or
cigarettes?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
your
sentence.
what
--
what
do
you
make
of
the
fact
that
states
can
create
their
own
forms?
arizona
has
its
own
form,
right?
and
i
don't
believe
you
argue
that
its
form
is
illegal.
maybe
you
think
it
is
and
you'll
explain
that.
but
what
--
and
arizona
could
put
on
its
own
form
a
demand
for
the
information
that
it
--
it
wants
to
apply
to
people
who
submit
the
federal
form.
it
seems
like
a
very
strange
system.
so
if
somebody
happens
to
fill
out
the
arizona
form,
their
application
may
be
rejected;
whereas
if
they
had
filled
out
the
federal
form,
it
would
be
accepted.
how
can
that
be?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
statutory
provision
would
you
challenge
that
under?
there's
--
there's
a
provision
under
the
statute,
the
numbers
are
complicated
and
i
don't
have
it
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue,
it
says
what
the
state
form
must
do
and
i
didn't
see
anything
in
that
that
would
--
that
would
preclude
their
requiring
this
additional
proof.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i've
read
all
those
provisions
and
--
all
right.
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
arizona
could
do
this
on
its
own
form.
you
haven't
argued
that
their
form
is
illegal.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
seems
to
me
like
a
crazy
system.
this
is
like
the,
you
know,
the
irs
creating
two
different
tax
returns
with
different
--
with
different
tax
rates
and
different
tax
tables
and
how
much
you
pay
would
depend
on
which
particular
form
you
happened
to
pick
up
and
submit.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
i
asked
ms.
millett?
does
the
united
states
think
that
the
arizona
form
is
illegal?
and
if
it
is
not,
what
sense
does
it
make
to
have
a
system
in
which
whether
or
not
someone
will
successfully
register
depends
on
the
happenstance
of
the
particular
form
that
the
person
fills
out.
