mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
national
voter
registration
act
aims
to
streamline
the
process
of
registration
for
applicants,
and
the
provisions
that
provide
for
the
establishment
of
a
federal
form
embody
that
objective.
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
three
features
of
the
relevant
statutory
language
that
i
think
support
our
reading.
and
the
particular
critical
provision
is
at
page
22a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
and
i'm
sorry,
i
know
that
the
provisions
are
located
in
a
number
of
areas,
but
the
gray
brief
at
page
22a
has
the
critical
provision
in
our
view,
which
is
one
that
ms.
millett
was
pointing
to.
and
that's
gg-7(b)(1).
now,
what
this
provision
embodies
is
this
understanding:
that
the
eac
is
the
one
who
determines
what
the
content
of
the
federal
form
is.
not
the
states,
but
the
eac.
the
states
do
have
a
role
in
this
scheme,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
what
that
role
is.
the
states
have
a
consultative
role
at
the
front
end.
and
this
is
back
at
page
21a
--
i'm
sorry
for
skipping
back.
but
at
page
21a
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
eac
is
to
develop
a
form
in
consultation
with
the
chief
election
officers
of
the
states.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
it
is,
justice
scalia,
but
i
think
the
problem
with
that
is
in
the
premise.
i
grant
you
that
the
statute
says
“
may
require
”,
but
it
says
“
may
require
only
”,
and
i
think
the
only
fair
way
to
read
this
provision
is
that
the
commission
is
to
require
the
information
that's
necessary,
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
“
may
require
only
”
in
effect
means
shall
require
information
that's
necessary,
but
may
only
require
that
information.
i
think
the
statute
would
make
very
little
sense
if
the
eac
discharged
its
statutory
responsibility
by
having
a
federal
form
that
required
nothing
other
than
the
name.
that
wouldn't
be
within
anybody's
conceivable
conception
of
a
rational
objective
of
congress
that
would
enable
the
eac
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
i
think
the
whole
point
of
this,
justice
scalia
--
and
this
is
where
i
started,
with
all
due
respect
--
is
to
come
forward
with
a
federal
form
that
streamlines
the
process
of
registration
for
applicants.
and
if
the
regime
that
resulted
were
one
in
which
the
federal
form
served
very
little
purpose
other
than
to
set
a
floor,
but
then
each
of
the
50
states
could
superimpose
whatever
additional
requirements
they
wanted
to,
i
think
that
would
largely
defeat
the
entire
purpose
of
the
federal
form.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
don't
think
so,
justice
breyer.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
coupled
with
the
statutory
objective,
because
what
this
provision
says
is
that
the
eac,
in
consultation
with
the
states,
is
supposed
to
create
a
form
that
imposes
the
following
burden
on
individuals,
on
individuals.
that's
the
key.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
sure.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
correct.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
do
think
that
that's
what
congress
contemplated
was
necessary,
but
not
to
the
exclusion
of
this,
which
is
that
if
a
state
comes
forward
to
the
eac,
which
is
a
body
that's
charged
with
responsibility
for
defining
the
contents
of
the
federal
form,
and
says
we
think
something
more
is
necessary,
take
a
look
at
what
we
want
to
submit
to
you,
and
you
should
amend
the
federal
form,
or
you
should
at
least
amend
our
state-specific
portion
of
the
federal
form
to
include
this
requirement
in
it,
the
eac
could
make
that
determination.
congress
made
that
responsibility--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
to
be
clear,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
general
horne
would
disagree
with
this
--
the
executive
director
initially
responded
to
the
request
by
rejecting
it,
but
it
did
go
to
the
full
commission,
and
at
that
point,
there
was
a
fully-constituted
commission.
the
commission
divided
by
a
vote
of
2-2.
and
so
in
that
instance,
the
commission
took
no
action.
but
a
2-2
vote
is
a
--
qualifies
as
a
rejection.
and
that
is
something
that
could
--
potentially
could
have
been
the
subject
of
judicial
review.
now,
i'm
obviously
not
going
to
give
away
any
federal
offenses
but--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
mean,
obviously,
i'd
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
i
think
we'll
be
in
perfectly
good
shape.
and
i
think
part
of
the
reason
is
that
this
--
requiring
a
statement
under
penalty
of
perjury
is
the
traditional
way
in
which
states
enforce
their
qualifications.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
understood
that
that
was
the
traditional
way.
what
the
state
seeks
to
do
here
is
do
something
over
and
above
the
traditional
way
to
enforce
qualifications.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
louisiana
is
not
--
is
not
situation-specific
here,
your
honor,
as
ms.
millett
was
pointing
out--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
correct.
and
that
was
submitted
to
the
eac,
and
the
eac
approved
of
it.
and
i
think
that's
the
critical
distinction
here.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
because
the
statute
--
the
statute
seeks
to
streamline
registration,
but
it's
not
directed
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
objectives.
and
the
eac
is
charged
with
balancing
the
various
competing
statutory
objectives.
and
it
concluded
in
--
with
respect
to
the
louisiana
submission
--
that
that
one
was
okay.
i
do
think
that's
different.
a,
because
the
eac
approved
of
it;
and
b,
because
the
specific
forms
of
identification
that
are
outlined
in
louisiana
addition
were
exactly
those
forms
of
identification
that
congress
already
said
was
okay
at
either
the
registration
stage
or
the
voting
stage.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things,
justice
scalia.
i'm
talking
about
louisiana.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
was
trying
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question.
in
arizona,
it
was
2-2.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
one
other
critical
feature
of
the
statute,
and
general
horne
alluded
to
this
and
said
that
there's
no
way
to
look
in
the
statute
and
see
a
distinction
between
on
one
hand
what
the
individuals
can
be
required
to
provide,
and
on
the
other
hand
what
the
state
can
then
do
with
the
individual
information
to
crosscheck
it.
and
the
statute
presupposes
that
the
state
can
conduct
its
own
investigation
to
crosscheck
the
information
that
the
individual
supplies.
and
then
the
critical
provision
to
see
that
is
at
page
19a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
and
that's
a
provision
that
deals
with
a
different
qualification,
felony
history.
but
it
operates
on
this
assumption
that
states
can
conduct
their
own
investigation,
which
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world.
this
provision
that's
in
subsection
(g)
at
the
top
of
the
page,
which
is
1973gg-6(g),
what
this
does
is
it
tells
the
united
states
attorney's
offices
that
when
there
is
a
federal
conviction
of
a
felony,
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
is
supposed
to
give
written
notice
of
that
conviction
to
the
chief
state
election
official.
and
what's
the
state
--
chief
state
election
official
going
to
do
with
that?
well
of
course,
what
they're
going
to
do
is
they're
going
to
take
a
look
at
the
federal
form,
they're
going
to
see
what
the
individual
said
about
their
felony
history,
and
they're
going
to
crosscheck
it
--
this
information
that
they
got
from
the
united
states
attorney
--
to
make
sure
that
the
information
on
the
form
is
accurate.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
here
is
the
sense
it
would
make
--
even
if
--
if
arizona
had
the
authority
to
add
to
the
federal
requirements
on
its
own
state
form,
the
sense
it
would
make
is
this:
that
the
federal
form
always
operates
as
a
form.
it's
always
there
for
somebody
to
use
to
register,
regardless
of
what
the
state
form
might
do
in
addition.
and
that
has
--
i
take
your
honor's
assumption
--
if
i
can
just
briefly
finish
--
i
understand
your
honor's
point
that
there
is
a
practical
question
about
whether
that
would
ever
be
practicable
or
useful,
given
that
an
individual
would
want
to
use
the
state
form
for
state,
local
and
federal
elections,
but
there
is
also
the
--
the
well-understood
practice
of
organizations
that
go
out
to
register
individuals
to
vote.
and
they
can
use
the
federal
form,
and
the
federal
form
would
suffice.
