but
it
did
--
but
congress
did
specify
how
citizenship
was
to
be
handled.
and
it
was
to
be
an
attestation,
a
signed
attestation
subject
to
--
to
the
penalty
of
perjury.
so
it's
not
as
though
the
federal
form
didn't
relate
to
citizenship.
it
did.
and
it
said
this
is
the
way
we
deal
with
citizenship.
then
arizona
adds
something
else.
so
i
would
like,
general
horne,
for
you
to
respond
to
a
question
that's
already
been
raised
in
--
by
the
--
the
panel
that
decided
this
case
originally,
which
was,
the
statute
said
--
says
each
state
must
accept
and
use
the
federal
form,
period.
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
then
it
says,
in
addition
to
that,
the
state
can
do
other
things.
the
judge
who
asked
that
question
thought
it
was
perfectly
clear,
you
use
the
federal
form,
and
if
you
want
to
do
something
in
addition
--
but
you
must
use
and
accept
the
federal
form
and
not
add
something
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
horne,
there
--
there
are
a
whole
list
of
state-specific
requirements
that
get
appended
to
the
form.
and
i
think
justice
scalia
was
raising
the
question,
did
you
ask
to
have
arizona's
requirement
--
just
as
the
other
state-specific
requirements
--
did
you
ask
the
federal
commission
to
include
as
a
state-specific
requirement
this
proof
of
citizenship?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
those
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
are
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
additional
--
the
question
here
is,
is
proof
of
citizenship
an
additional
thing
the
state
can
ask.
now
you're
telling
us
that
there
are
some
additional
things.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
--
can
you
explain
--
it's
puzzling.
you
have
all
these
state-specific
and
pages
of
state-specific
requirements.
what
state-specific
requirements
are
permitted
and
what
state-specific
requirements
are
not
permitted?
you're
putting
the
citizenship
on
the
not
permitted
side
of
the
line.
what
is
permitted
and
what
is
not
permitted
and
what's
the
difference
in
the
two
categories?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
srinivasan,
i
think
general
horne
told
us
that
--
that
the
state
did
ask
the
commission,
but
the
commission
had
only
two
members;
the
commission
didn't
act
on
it.
only
the
legal
director.
so
how
could
they
get
court
review
of
an
agency
decision
that
was
never
made?
