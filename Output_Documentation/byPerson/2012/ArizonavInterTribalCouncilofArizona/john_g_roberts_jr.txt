chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-71,
arizona
v.
the
inter
tribal
council
of
arizona.
general
horne.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
millett?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
ms.
millett,
is
there
--
i
take
it
under
your
theory
what
the
eac
allowed
louisiana
to
do
was
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
i
know.
i'm
assuming
that,
and
i'm
saying
they
were
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you've
got
a
great
deal
of
reliance
on
what
the
eac
has
done,
and
i'm
saying
if
it's
not
doing
a
very
good
job,
i'd
be
--
i'd
question
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
the
eac
is
going
to
implement
it
is
sufficient
assurance
that
the
act
reads
the
way
you
say
it
does.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
just
different
forms.
you'd
have
different
voter
rolls
then,
right,
depending
on
which
form?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
would
have
thought
since
you
allow
--
contemplate
a
state
form
that
has
different
requirements
than
the
federal
form,
you
would
then
end
up
with
two
different
voter
rolls.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
some
people
that
registered
under
the
state
form,
some
people
that
registered
under
the
federal
form.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah,
but
it
doesn't
work
the
other
way.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
satisfy
the
federal
form,
so
you're
on
the
federal
list,
but
not
satisfy
the
state
form,
so
you're
not
on
the
state
list.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
srinivasan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
as
--
as
louisiana
has
done.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
certainly
things
that
were
not
required
in
the
federal
form.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
is
that
consistent
with
the
statutory
purpose
to
streamline
registration?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
general
horne,
two
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-71,
arizona
versus
the
intertribal
council
of
arizona.
