ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
arizona
simply
disagrees
with
the
balance
that
congress
drew.
and
when
it
comes
to
registration,
justice
kennedy
and
justice
kagan,
you're
both
correct,
the
whole
point
of
the
federal
form
is
that
congress
had
to
draw
a
different
balance.
it
confronted
a
situation
in
which
40
percent
of
eligible
voters
were
not
registered,
because
state
procedures
and
burdens
were
standing
as
an
obstacle,
a
barrier
in
the
direct
line
of
accountability
between
individual
citizens
and
their
federal
government.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
first--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--first
of
all,
with
--
with
respect
to
the
driver's
license,
it's
only
driver's
licenses
issued
after
1996,
october
1996,
and
those
that
were
not
--
that
someone
did
not
obtain
when
they
became
naturalized.
so
you
have
to
be
about
33
years
of
age.
anyone
older
than
that,
their
driver's
license
isn't
going
to
work.
and,
in
fact,
mr.
gonzalez
in
this
case
used
his
driver's
license
number
and
got
bounced.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
gonzalez
did
that
as
well
and
the
naturalization
certificate
got
bounced
because
the
naturalization
certificate,
when
put
into
the
computer,
does
not
produce
records.
it
is
a
mistake
in
arizona's
proposition
200.
neither
way
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--joint
appendix
page
263,
the
district
court
found
that
31,550
people
were
rejected
from
voting
because
of
proposition
200.
even
on
that
same
page
he
finds
that
11,000
of
them
subsequently
registered
but
they
had
to
do
the
double
gauntlet
that
congress
was
trying
to
eliminate.
the
other
20,000
swore
under
oath
that
they
were
citizens
and
mr.
horne
before
the
ninth
circuit
conceded
he
had
no
evidence
that
they
were
not
citizens--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--of
the
united
states.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we
interpret
“
accept
and
use
”,
it's
mainly
the
latter,
your
second
one,
and
that
is
that
it
is
a
limitation
on
what
can
be
asked
of
the
individual
and
that's
not
just
from
the
section
4
language
where
accept
and
use
comes
from.
but
what's
critical
here
is
section
gg-7
which
is
on
26h
of
the
petition
appendix
here.
and
that's
where
they
say
on
this
form.
the
form
may
require
only,
may
require
only
--
from
the
applicant,
i'm
adding
that
in
--
such
identifying
information
essentially
as
the
commission
determines
is
necessary
to
allow
the
state
to
make
its
decision.
now
this
is
not
just
a
ticket
into
the
state's
own
registration
process
so
they
can
go
thank
you
very
much
for
throwing
it
in
the
garbage
can,
now
do
what
we
would
like
you
to
do.
it
is
a
registration
form,
and
when
filled
out
completely
and
submitted
under
oath
it
has
the
same
legal--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--as
the
registration
form.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
they
may
not
require
anything
else
from
the
applicant
but
they
can
certainly
apply
their
own
evidence
that
they
obtain,
whether
it's
from
their
own
eyeballs
or
whether
it
is
through
records
or
databases
that
they
run
these
through
which
is
the
more
common
one,
and
make
a
decision.
now
a
decision,
the
decision
isn't
simply
we
would
like
more
from
you.
that's
not
an
appropriate
decision.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
my
answer
is
when
you
look
at
26h
it's
talking
about
the
form.
and
first,
we
know
that
the
commission
is
the
one
that
decides
what
is
necessary
on
this
form,
a
decision
that
wasn't
challenged--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
can
certainly
be
challenged
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it
was
not
in
this
case.
but
it
says
what
is
necessary
on
this
form.
now,
when
you
talk
about
what's
necessary
on
a
form
you're
talking
about
from
the
applicant.
so
this
defines
what
is
necessary
from
the
applicant,
what
can
be
requested
or
demanded
from
the
applicant--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--on
the
form,
exactly.
on
the
form.
and
that
is
the
necessary
information
to
let
them
apply
their
own
tools
and
make
the
decisions
that
the
states
make--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
commission,
let
me
just
--
if
we
turn
to
26h
at
the
very
top
line--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--26h,
where
it
has
a
number
1,
let's
insert
the
commission
before
i
get
to
the
word
“
may
”.
and
that's
all
you
need
to
do.
we
know
from
the
prior
page
the
commission
is
the
one
doing
this.
the
commission
may
require
only
from
the
applicant.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that's
all
the
commission
is
allowed
to
require
from
the
applicant.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
and
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
state
to
do
it.
if,
justice
breyer,
if
the
question
is
they
may
require
that,
and
then
the
state
can
require
anything
else
it
wants,
it
is
an
utterly
pointless
form.
and
what
we
know
from
six--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
what
congress
would
have
assigned
to
them.
but
even
if
it
were,
justice
scalia--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
something
to
be
challenged
through
the
administrative
procedure
act--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the
relevant
phraseology
is
may
require
only,
and
that
is
not
your
normal
permissive
language.
it's
actually
congress
--
it
is
language
of
limitation
when
used
that
way.
“
you
may
require
only
”
does
not
mean
that
you
may
--
that
you
may
do
what
you
want,
and
they
have
further
down--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
you
may
require
what
is
necessary
to
enable.
so
the
language
here,
i
think
any
fair
reading
--
and
we
don't
strain
the
language
in
this
context
--
the
natural
reading
is
that
they
may
require
only
the
information
from
the
applicant
that's
necessary
essentially
to
shift
the
burden.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
would
just
like
to
add
to
that,
justice
breyer,
two
points,
and
that
is
with
respect
to
citizenship
in
particular,
not
only
does
the
statute,
the
nvra
flag
it,
but
the
help
america
vote
act
in
2002.
so
even
if
you
don't
want
to
go
just
with
the
legislative
history,
justice
scalia,
in
2002
congress
revisited
the
citizenship
requirement
for
the
federal
form
and
it
added
a
box
that
you
have
to
check
that
you
are
a
citizen
--
that
you
are
a
citizen.
so
congress
revisited
this
issue
after
the
statute
had
been
in
effect
for
nine
years.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it's
unclear.
it's
a
little
different
in
that
context
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
commission
made
the
decision
so
they
have
that.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
oh,
i'm
sorry.
and
then
the
second
thing
is
the
information
that's
required
there
is
information
for
the
most
part
that
is
--
that
the
help
america
vote
act
allows
states
to
require
of
individuals.
now,
in
the
help
america
to
vote
act,
it's
an
either
do
it
at
the
polls
or
do
it
in
the
registration.
maybe
the
commission
thought
it
could
forward
it,
but
at
least
there
you
have
two
profound
differences
and
that
is
it's
at
least
information
that
a
separate
statute
has
said
states
can
require
from
individuals.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
but
i
think
it's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
is
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
it's
not
proof
of
citizenship.
what
it
is,
is
an
identification
requirement
that
can
be
applied
at
the
polls
or
the
help
america
vote
act
says
at
the
time
of
registration.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
okay.
first
of
all,
the
state
requirement
of
citizenship,
it's
permitted
in
the
sense
that
congress
requires
in
three
different
ways
that
citizenship
be
affirmed.
it's
simply
disagreeing
about
proof.
so
it's
not
as
though
citizenship
is
left
off
this
form,
it's
simply
a
question
of
how
it's
proved.
but
the
help
america
--
just
to
get
right
to
your
question
--
there's
two
aspects
to
the
help
america
vote
act
that
change
this
form
a
little
bit.
when
you
go
through
those
instructions,
what
you
will
see
--
here's
what
those
state-specific
instructions
are:
they
are
the
requirement
that
you
put
in
an
id
number
that
is
required
by
the
help
america
vote
act
required.
so
clearly,
that
is
to
be
on
the
form
because
another
statute
requires
it.
and
then
you
put
on
--
it
says
to
put
on
party
identification
for
the
states
that
have
it.
some
states
have
race
identified,
and
then
the
instructions
tell
you
about
the
different
filing
deadlines--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
no--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--just
the
identification
number.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
there's
two
--
those
are
things
that
are
in
the
state
--
when
you
look
at
those
state-specific
instructions,
they
are
not
add-ons.
they
are
not
adding
attachments.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that
would
be
a
very
different
lawsuit
that
was
never
brought
in
this
case.
and
this
just
--
the
louisiana
thing
just
happened
in--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--but
the
act,
i
think,
by
--
by
its
own
plain
language
and
by
its
normal
--
it
can't
have
no
--
there
is
only
two
ways
to
look
at
this
statute.
it
either
created
a
form
that
is
simply
to
be
the
servant
of
every
state
and
they
can
pile
on
to
it
anything
else
they
want,
and
that
is
utterly
irreconcilable
to
congress's
findings
and
the
entire
purpose
of
this
statute
or
this
is
congress's
registration
mechanism
that
it
shows
exercising
its
power.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
this
is
--
statements--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--statements
under
oath,
statements
under
oath
in
a
criminal
case--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--statements
under
oath
in
a
criminal
case
are
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
which
we
execute
them.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it's
a
very
serious
oath
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
there
is
two
responses.
one,
it's
an
open
question
whether
what
--
whether
the
state
form
for
purposes
of
federal
elections
can
add
new
requirements,
but
we
haven't
challenged
it,
we
haven't
challenged
here
and
i
think
it's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
--
i
think
it's
actually
a
very
complicated
question.
and
so
to
be
clear,
there
is
statutory
language,
i
think,
going
both
ways
on
this
question.
there
is
in
4(a)(2),
which
says
the
state
form
has
to
meet
the
criteria
of
7(b),
but
then
--
and
then
there
is
in
5(a)(6),
which
says,
if
you're
going
to
be
handing
it
out
as
your
public
office,
it's
the
public
agencies
have
to
provide
the
form,
it
has
to
be
equivalent.
but
then
in
section
2
--
i'm
sorry
to
throw
all
these
numbers,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
show
you
how
it's
complicated.
in
section
2,
the
very
background
for
the
federal
form
is
that
it's
in
addition
to
whatever
the
states
are
already
doing--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--correct.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
not
--
not
in
this
sense.
first
of
all,
it
would
be
very
respectful
of
the
states
and
congress
to
arrive
at
a
balance
here,
if
it
did
that.
but
congress
has
made
clear
that
there
is
this
essentially
safe
harbor
role
for
the
federal
form
and
that
--
and
they
can't
hide
it
away.
it
has
to
be
available
for
the
--
the
driver's
license
and
motor
voter
process.
it
has
to
be
handed
out
at
the
relevant
public
agencies,
and
the
mail
form
is
available
to
be
handed
out
or
online
for
people
to
find.
and
so
yes,
could
it
be
different
--
it's
an
open
question
whether
that's
what
congress
wanted
for
federal
elections
or
not
or
whether--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
oh,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--as
--
as
of
now,
arizona
is
doing
it
as
a
unitary
system.
because
anyone
who
fills
out
the
state
form
necessarily
satisfies
the
requirement
of
the
federal
form.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
doesn't
work
the
other
way.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
doesn't
work
the
other
way
at
least
for
state
elections.
for
federal
--
for
federal
elections,
it
has
to
be
the
same.
and
so
for
federal
elections,
it's
a
single
roll.
it's
up
to
states
to
decide
how
they
want
to
deal
with
the
state
form.
at
the
time
the
congress
enacted
this
statute,
about
half
of
the
states
in
1993,
including
arizona,
had
a
postcard
form
where
you
just
attested
to
citizenship
under
oath.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
first
of
all,
the
ninth
circuit's
test
came
out
of
this
court's
language
in
siebold.
it
had
both
conflict
language
and
harmonization,
both
of
which
appear
in
this
court's
decision
in
siebold.
but
to
get
directly
to
your
question
of
whether
there
should
be
a
different
test,
i
don't
think
it
matters
on
the
outcome
in
this
case,
because
the
preemption
is
in
those
31,550
people
who
couldn't
register.
but
i
think
the
election
clause
is
going
to
be
very
different
in
this
sense
--
in
two
critical
senses.
and
that
is
that
the
elections
clause
involves
an
authority
in
the
states
that
is
conferred
by
the
constitution
itself.
may
i
finish?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
--
it
has
no
reserve
power
that's
being
protected
there,
and
by
the
very
nature
of
the
election
clause
is
that
congress
only
acts
when
it
means
to
displace
or
change
what
the
states
are
doing.
and
so
the
necessity
of
having
a
presumption
makes
no
sense
in
this
context,
particularly
when
you're
talking
again
about
a
federal
form
for
federal
elections
of
federal
officials
by
federal
voters
who
need
a
direct
line
of
accountability.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you.
