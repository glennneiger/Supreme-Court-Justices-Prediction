mr.
richard
bourke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
louisiana
court
of
appeal
in
this
case
correctly
found
that
the
majority
of
the
delay,
the
7-year
delay
was
caused
by
the
lack
of
funding,
but
when
moving
to
assess
that
cause
under
barker,
incorrectly
determined
that
it
was
a
cause
beyond
the
control
of
the
state,
and
adopting
its
earlier
ruling
under
the
state
statute
found
that
it
was
a
cause
beyond
the
control
of
the
state
in
the
sense
that
it
was
beyond
the
control
of
the
local
district
attorney's
office.
mr.
richard
bourke
he
was
unable
to
fund
himself,
your
honor,
that
is
why
he
asked
for
the
appointment
of
counsel.
mr.
richard
bourke
yes.
mr.
richard
bourke
that
is
--
he
was
unable
to
move
forward
to
trial
because
he
was
not
provided
with
counsel
adequately
funded
to
advance
the--
mr.
richard
bourke
--in
fact
in
a
sense,
your
honor,
he
had
two
counsel.
mr.
richard
bourke
no,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
bourke
--that
is
not
correct.
that
is
not
the
state
of
louisiana
law.
mr.
richard
bourke
louisiana
absolutely
does
not
provide
a
right
to
two
counsel
in
capital
cases.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
rule
31
provided
that
the
court
should
appoint
two
counsel,
but
also
it
provided
expressly
that
that
created
no
procedural
or
substantive
right.
similarly
there
is
no
right--
mr.
richard
bourke
--that
is
not
the
law
in
louisiana.
mr.
richard
bourke
it
is
a
supreme
court
rule
which
directs
the
trial
judge
to
appoint
two
counsel.
however,
it
makes
it
clear--
mr.
richard
bourke
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the--
mr.
richard
bourke
--no,
your
honor.
in
--
in
this
case,
as
the
court
of
appeal
correctly
found,
mr.
boyer
did
not
have
adequate
funding
for
the
case
to
go
to
trial.
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
predicate
that
on
the
need
for
two
counsel.
the
motion
to
determine
source
of
funds
was
not
predicated
on
rule
31.
mr.
richard
bourke
mr.
lorenzi
was
lead
certified
counsel.
mr.
richard
bourke
correct.
mr.
richard
bourke
mr.
lorenzi
declined
to
pay
for
mr.
boyer's
defense
out
of
his
own
pocket.
mr.
richard
bourke
there
was--
mr.
richard
bourke
--there
was
at
all
times
one
counsel
appointed
as
associate
counsel,
that
is
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
mr.
lorenzi
as
lead
counsel.
mr.
richard
bourke
well,
i
don't
understand
the
--
the
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
to
place--
mr.
richard
bourke
--a
qualification
minimum,
so
i'm
not
sure
i'm
understanding
your
question.
mr.
richard
bourke
the
--
there
is
no
--
i'm
having
trouble
answering
the
question,
justice
scalia,
because
the
two
things
don't
talk
to
each
other.
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
impose
a
certification
requirement.
mr.
richard
bourke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
bourke
the
court
of
appeal
twice
found
--
knowing
that
associate
counsel
had
been
appointed,
the
court
of
appeal
twice
found
that
the
case
could
not
proceed
due
to
a
lack
of
adequate
funding
and
the
state--
mr.
richard
bourke
--your
honor,
if
mr.
boyer
had
been
brought
into
court
and
had
been
told,
we've
got
associate
counsel
here;
they
are
qualified
in
the
sense
that
they
are
barred
in
louisiana;
and
they
can
take
your
case
to
trial
and
move
it
forward
now.
but
if
you
wait,
we
might
have
funding
for
another
lawyer
here
who
will
join
him,
is
more
senior
in
experience,
that
will
double
your
firepower.
you
can
choose,
mr.
boyer,
do
you
want
to
go
ahead
now
with
this
guy,
or
do
you
want
to
wait?
in
that
circumstance
there
would
not
be
an
invidious
choice
between
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
to
speedy
trial.
it
would
be,
we
are
giving
you
constitutionally
adequate
counsel,
and
you
can
wait
for
better
if
you
wish
to.
but
that
is
not
what
occurred
here.
and,
justice
scalia,
the--
mr.
richard
bourke
--because
the
funding
problem
did
not
exist
solely
around
mr.
lorenzi's
overhead
and
expenditure.
there
was
no
money
for
investigation,
there
was
no
money
for
experts.
and
the
associate
counsel
who
had
been
appointed
had
been
appointed
solely
and
for
the
limited
purpose
as
an
assistant
to
mr.
lorenzi,
not
to
conduct
the
case
in
his
own
right.
if
this
issue
had
been
raised
in
the
trial
court,
this
would
have
been
clearly
explained
into
this
record.
it
wasn't.
but
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
court
--
the
court
of
appeal,
third
circuit
in
louisiana,
knew
and
understood
that
there
was
no
investigative
funding,
there
was
no
expert
funding,
there
had
been
an
assistant.
this
isn't
the
case
where
there
was
a
lawyer
appointed
and
they
were
waiting
for
the
second
lawyer.
it's
a
case
where
they'd
found
an
assistant
and
were
waiting
for
the
first
lawyer.
mr.
richard
bourke
that
is
a
very
case-specific
determination,
your
honor,
and
in
louisiana
at
that
time
rested
with
a
judicial
determination
that
the
investigative
or
expert
expenses
were
reasonably
necessary
to
ensure
a
fair
trial
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause.
so
it
was
a
funding
level
tagged
to
the
constitutional
minimum
of
due
process.
mr.
richard
bourke
there
was
never--
mr.
richard
bourke
--no,
your
honor,
that
was
one
of
the
big
tag
items.
but
in
a
capital
case,
the
investigation
of
both
the
guilt
phase
and
the
full
mitigation
and
life
investigation,
along
with
the
use
of
potential
expert
witnesses,
particularly
in
the
case
where
there
were
all
the
indications
of
mental
health
problems
and
the
like,
are
often
equal
to
or
in
some
cases
greater
than
the
cost
of
counsel.
and
so
no,
the
big
tag
item
wasn't
just
mr.
lorenzi's
overhead
and
expenses.
the
big
tag
item
was
providing
adequate
funding.
and
to
return
to
your
earlier
point,
justice
scalia,
just
to
--
to
make
it
clear,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
cases
which
mandate
that
a
case
cannot
go
forward
without
counsel
do
not
reference
rule
31
at
all,
or
two
counsel.
they
are
cases
which
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
case
cannot
go
forward
without
constitutionally
adequate
counsel,
counsel
who
can
provide
reasonably
effective
assistance.
this
case
began
in
2002.
at
that
point,
the
controlling
louisiana
decision
on
not
moving
forward
without
effective
assistance
was
peart,
p-e-a-r-t,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
which
said
that
the
court
will
not
allow
a
case
to
proceed
without
reasonably
effective
counsel.
during
the
life
of
this
case
--
sorry.
mr.
richard
bourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
bourke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
bourke
well,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
bourke
--that
is
what
judge
cook
said.
mr.
richard
bourke
your
honor,
what
mr.
boyer
did
was
act
at
all
times
in
full
compliance
with
the
procedural
mechanisms
set
up
in
louisiana
for
doing
that.
at
arraignment
--
he
had
already
identified
he
was
indigent
and
asked
for
counsel.
at
arraignment,
he
requested
a
jury
trial.
his
lawyer
was
appointed,
and
his
lawyer
immediately
identified
the
funding
problem,
and
said:
we
need
money
or
we
can't
go
forward.
louisiana
statute
bars
counsel
from
filing
a
motion
for
speedy
trial
without
an
affidavit
saying
you're
ready
to
go
forward.
louisiana
has
said
in
article
7--
mr.
richard
bourke
--it's
a
procedural
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
bourke
well,
your
honor,
the
rule
i
am
referring
to
is
a
procedural
rule.
it
does
not
in
any
way
limit
the
relief
from
a
speedy
trial,
but
you
can't
move
for
a
speedy
trial.
you
can
move
to
quash
because
you
have
been
denied
one,
but
you
can't
move
for
one.
it's
exactly
what
this
court
referred
to
in--
mr.
richard
bourke
--that
was
the
first
point
at
which
under
louisiana
procedure
he
had
a
remedy
available,
exactly
as
judge
cook
stated
in
her
abstaining
opinion.
that
was
when
he
could
move
to
quash.
he
could
not
move
for
a
speedy
trial
in
a
valid
motion
for
speedy
trial
without
having
an
affidavit
saying,
we
are
ready
to
go.
louisiana
has
passed
that
rule
to
stop
pro
forma
requests
for
speedy
trial.
mr.
richard
bourke
we
do,
your
honor.
that
armed
robbery
charge
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
first-degree
murder
count.
mr.
boyer
was
originally
indicted
on
first-degree
murder,
which
in
louisiana
is
intentional
killing
during
the
course
of
an
armed
robbery.
there
are
other
varieties,
of
course.
but
intentional
killing
during
an
armed
robbery.
and
those
are
the
elements
of
first-degree
murder.
the
state
unpacked
those
two
elements,
or
two
lesser
included
offenses,
to
second-degree
murder,
which
is
intentional
killing,
and
armed
robbery.
and
the
state
in
fact
conceded
that
had
the
charge
remained
a
first-degree
murder
charge
then
the
armed
robbery
charge
would
have
created
a
double
jeopardy
problem,
and
that's
at
page
3703
to
'4
of
the
record,
where
counsel
for
the
state
indicated
that
the
armed
robbery
charge
could
be
added
because
the
primary
charge,
the
first-degree
murder,
had
been
dropped
to
second-degree
murder,
and
specifically
said,
"mr.
bourke
is
correct
that
had
we
filed
for
first-degree
murder,
there
may
be
double
jeopardy
problems.
"
but
because
they
had
unpacked
that
charge
from
murder
and
armed
robbery
down
to
murder
and
also
armed
robbery,
there
was
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
mr.
richard
bourke
justice
kennedy--
mr.
richard
bourke
--well,
i
think
it
starts
with
the
proposition
that
it
is
the
state,
not
the
prosecutor
who
has
the
responsibility
to
ensure
a
speedy
trial
in
accordance
with
due
process.
and
then
the
state
can
make
all
sorts
of
different
arrangements
and
the
states
around
this
country
make
different
arrangements,
but
it's
their
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
they
work.
and
if
they
don't
work,
then
the
state
is
going
to
have
to
make
reasonable
accommodation
for
that
to
meet
its
responsibility.
and
so
by
assisting
the
cause
of
delay
against
the
state,
but
within
the
barker
weighing
framework,
the
court's
dealing
with
speedy
trial
claims
would
be
able
to
deal
with
short-term
unexpected
exigencies,
they
would
be
able
to
weigh
the
reasonableness
of
the
response.
a
valid
reason
for
delay
will
justify
that
delay,
as
this
court
said
in
barker,
but
here--
mr.
richard
bourke
--yes.
mr.
richard
bourke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
bourke
the
first
thing
that
we
want
is
exactly
that,
your
honor,
that
the
court
below
incorrectly
--
incorrectly
failed
to
attribute
this
to
the
state.
and
this
court
--
i
accept
this
court
could
stop
there
and
remand
to
the
third
circuit
to
deal
with
that
in
accordance
with--
mr.
richard
bourke
--well,
your
honor,
it
--
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
this
court
to
answer
the
question
by
saying
the
court
got
it
wrong
at
the
first
step
by
failing
to
attribute
it
to
the
state
and
then
remand
for
full
consideration
of
weighing
in
light
of
that.
what
we
have
asked
in
our
briefing
for
the
court
to
do
is
to
also
provide
some
guidance
on
the
weight
that
should
be
given
to
delay
resulting
from
the
lack
of
funding,
because
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
bourke
--your
honor,
i'd
suggest
that
this
court
does
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
louisiana
court
of
appeal
did
with
them,
which
was
to
find
that
it
was
the
lack
of
funding,
not
any
action
by
mr.
lorenzi,
which
caused
the
delay.
the
louisiana
court
of
appeal
declined
to
adopt
the
state's
argument
that
it
was
mr.
lorenzi's
fault.
and
the
reason
it
did
that
was
because
the
lack
of
a
funding
hearing
caused
no
delay
at
all
in
the
conduct
of
this
trial.
the
funding
hearing
when
conducted
produced
no
funding,
no
ruling
or
order
and
had
no
influence
on
the
date
of
the
trial.
and,
of
course,
the
right
at
issue
was
the
right
to
go
to
trial,
not
to
--
the
time
of
the
pretrial
hearings.
furthermore,
all
of
those
continuances
which
were
joined
in
by
the
state
were
related
to
trying
to
identify
and
find
funding
for
this
case
and
for
this
man.
none
of
them
were
for
a
dilatory
purpose.
they
were
because
a
new
procedure
was
in
--
occupies
to
submit
bills
in
a
different
way
to
the
idb,
because
the
louisiana
supreme
court
had
accepted
the
citizen
--
and
ultimately--
mr.
richard
bourke
--in
the
absence
of
funding,
there
was
no
trial
to
be
had.
at
the
funding
hearing
--
or
i'm
sorry
--
at
the
motion
to
quash
hearing
in
november
2006,
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecutor
in
which
the
trial
court
said,
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
this
case?
they
can't
have
a
defense
without
money.
this
was
not,
absolutely
not--
mr.
richard
bourke
--well,
under
louisiana's
article
701,
there
was
no
filing
a
motion
for
speedy
trial,
saying,
please
give
me
a
speedy
trial,
set
a
date
now.
and
at
the
same
time--
mr.
richard
bourke
--your
honor,
this
court
in
barker,
when
dealing
with
this
very
topic
under
the
issue
of
assertion,
specifically
said
it
would
allow
judges
to
take
account
of
assertion
in
accordance
with
local
procedural
requirements.
the
local
procedural
requirement
in
a
state
that
already
has
its
own
statutory
prescriptive
period,
if
you
don't
bring
second-degree
murder
to
trial
within
two
years,
you're
out.
the
--
louisiana
does
not
need
a
defendant
to
tell
them
that
they
have
to
bring
a
speedy
trial,
and
they
don't
want
a
defendant
doing
it
unless
they're
ready
to
go
to
trial
themselves.
they
don't
want
the
sort
of
pro
forma
assertion
that
was
rejected.
mr.
richard
bourke
in
july
of
2005--
mr.
richard
bourke
--in
july
of
2005,
mr.
lorenzi
moved
to
quash
the
indictment
and
said
exactly
that.
said
it's
too
late,
no
funding,
no
trial,
speedy
trial
is
up.
and
it
was
still
another
2
years
before
the
funding
crisis
was
solved.
so
there
was
a
very
lengthy
period
if
such
notice
were
required,
and
that
is
not,
in
our
submission,
the
message
from
barker
and
the
message
from
article
701,
they
got
that
notice
in
july
2005,
when
there
was
the
motion
to
quash.
and
returning
to
your
question--
mr.
richard
bourke
--if
i
can
clarify
that,
justice
ginsburg,
mr.
lorenzi
was
at
pains
to
say
he
was
not
withdrawing
the
motion,
but
dismissing
the
motion
to
quash
because
he
couldn't
advance
it
in
a
successful
way
in
louisiana
without
demonstrating
prejudice.
mr.
richard
bourke
he
specifically--
mr.
richard
bourke
--well,
the
point,
your
honor,
was
that
he
was
not
withdrawing
his
claim
to
a
speedy
trial,
but
rather,
dismissing
his
motion
to
quash
on
the
violation
of
that
at--
mr.
richard
bourke
--no,
it
was
dismissed.
he
chose
dismiss
rather
than
withdraw
is
the
word
and
what
he
intended
by
that
was
that
he
wasn't
saying,
i
don't
want
one;
he
was
saying,
i
can't
bring
the
type
of
hearing
louisiana
courts
require
to
get
my
six
amendment
motion
to
quash
granted.
mr.
richard
bourke
to
move
for
a
speedy
trial,
he
had
to
do
exactly
that.
mr.
richard
bourke
the
local
procedural
requirements
for
how
one
goes
about
doing
that.
mr.
richard
bourke
it's
the
difference
between
moving
for
a
speedy
trial,
please
give
me
a
trial
date,
i
want
to
go
to
trial
next
week,
and
moving
to
quash
because
the
speedy
trial
right
has
been
violated.
mr.
richard
bourke
he
moved
to
quash
at
the
first
moment
that
it
became
available
under
the
state
statute,
which
was
at
the
3-year
mark.
he
moved
1
month
after
that
3-year
mark
as
soon
as
it
became
available.
mr.
richard
bourke
yes,
your
honor.
article
579
and
following
provides
that
the
state
must
bring
a
first-degree
murder
charge
to
trial
within
3
years
or
the
case
is
proscribed,
the
indictment
must
be
dismissed
with
prejudice.
and
so
the
state
always
knew
it
had
that
deadline.
it
didn't
even
set
a
trial
date
for
a
period
of
over
3
years
in
the
middle
of
this,
didn't
even
try
to
set
a
trial
date
for
3-1/2
years,
didn't
bring
mr.
boyer
into
court
for
3-1/2
years
to
address
his
case
at
all.
and
so
as
soon
as
the
remedy
available
became
open,
as
judge
cook
said
in
her
opinion,
defense
counsel
filed
using
exactly
the
remedy
provided
for.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
bourke
thank
you.
and
i
have
a
few
points
of
clarification
that
i
want
to
make
just
in
a
very
quick
fashion.
justice
sotomayor,
there
was
no
funding
in
2001,
2002,
2003.
it
was
never
there.
if
your
honor
looks
at
the
louisiana
supreme
court
opinion
in
citizen,
it
will
describe
the
turner
case
funding
hearing
in
2001.
mr.
lorenzi
was
stuck
with
that
one
as
well.
there
was
no
money.
mr.
lorenzi
did
indeed
submit
bills
in
2003,
because
a
new
procedure
had
been
announced,
and
that's
at
page
--
joint
appendix
page
401
to
'3.
you'll
see
the
correspondence
showing
he
did
submit
bills
and
there
was
no
money.
mr.
richard
bourke
right.
it
was
underwater.
it
was
oversubscribed.
it--
mr.
richard
bourke
--yes,
certainly.
mr.
richard
bourke
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
bourke
the
passage
you're
referring
to
is
from
a
writ
application
purely
limited
to
the
application
of
the
state
speedy
trial
statute,
which
does
accord
a
new
clock
to
every
new
filing.
so
under
louisiana
state
statutory
law,
the
armed
robbery
started
the
state
statutory
clock
again,
but
that
is
not
the
case
for
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
richard
bourke
the
armed
robbery
was
a
lesser
included
of
first-degree
murder,
but
it
is
not
a
lesser
included
of
second-degree
murder.
our
double
jeopardy
argument
was
the
same
force
was
applied
in
both,
the
force
for
the
murder
and
the
force
for
the
armed
robbery.
so
that's
completely
irrelevant.
but
that
was
a
state
statutory
argument
about
the
armed
robbery
charge
which
has
no
application
in
the
case
in
front
of
us.
mr.
richard
bourke
it
is
well
beyond
the
question
presented,
your
honor,
i
agree.
your
honor,
the--
mr.
richard
bourke
--he
has
a
murder
and
armed
robbery
conviction
from
the
same
incident.
it's
the
same
charge
as
the
first-degree
murder,
it's
just
unpacked.
mr.
richard
bourke
that
--
that
is
why
this
court
would
remand
to
allow
the
--
the
local
court
to
deal
with
it,
and
ensure
that
that's
accurate.
justice
breyer,
the
reference
to
our
earlier
--
the
decision
of
this
court
and
the
supreme
court
is
a
reference
to
the
earlier
decision
on
the
interlocutory
writ
application,
the
earlier
decision
that
a
lack
of
adequate
funds
prevented
the
prosecution.
and
if
your
honor
looks
at
joint
appendix
at
page
126,
which
is
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit,
you
will
see
earlier
in
their
opinion
they
discuss
their
own
earlier
ruling
on
the
supreme
court--
