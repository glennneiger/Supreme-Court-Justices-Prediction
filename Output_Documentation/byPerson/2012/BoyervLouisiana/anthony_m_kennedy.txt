can
you
tell
me
why
that
is
not
what
occurred
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
--
what
about
the
basic
problem
in
this
case
as
i
understand
the
question
presented,
is,
should
the
state
be
responsible
when
the
funding
problem
is
at
a
local
level?
so
suppose
you
have
a
state
that
says,
you
know,
we
have
had
problems
in
funding;
if
we
give
this
to
the
county,
it's
going
to
be
much
better,
and
the
counties
are
very,
very
good
at
raising
money
and
knowing
who
the
counsel
are.
so
it's
all
handled
by
the
county.
then
one
county
has
a
disaster,
a
hurricane
in
that
county
particularly.
is
that
not
a
reason
for
delaying,
or
does
the
state
have
to
immediately
step
in
and
supplement
the
funding?
can't
the
county
say,
oh,
we
need
another
2
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that's
the
issue
that
we're
trying
to
decide
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
like
to
get
the
structure
of
your
argument.
you
began
to
say
there's
three
reasons.
i
would
just
like
to
hear
those
three
reasons
so
that
i
can
understand
the
framework
for
all
these
questions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
three
reasons
that
we
should
affirm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
and
the
second?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
thank
you.
