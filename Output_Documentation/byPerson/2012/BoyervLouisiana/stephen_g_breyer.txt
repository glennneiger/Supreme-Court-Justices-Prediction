justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
point
of
view
in
this
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
your
point
of
view,
would
it
satisfy
you
if
we
say
the
louisiana
court
of
appeal
found
the
largest
part
of
the
delay
involved
the
funding
crisis
experienced
by
the
state
of
louisiana
--
that
meant
giving
you
adequate
money
for
counsel.
then
they
said,
the
progression
of
the
prosecution
was
out
of
the
state's
control
as
determined
by
this
court,
which
i
think
referred
to
that
funding
crisis.
and
we
could
--
and
your
view
would
be
that's
what
they
said.
we
don't
know
the
underlying
facts,
but
that's
what
they
said.
and
insofar
as
they
said
that
the
state
wasn't
responsible
for
that
part
of
the
delay
that
they
are
talking
about,
they're
wrong,
because
the
state
is
responsible
for
not
providing
enough
money,
even
if
there's
a
problem
and
to
say
they
weren't
responsible
is
wrong,
okay?
that's
what
you
want
us
to
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
period,
and
send
it
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
answer
to
the
question,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
do
--
this
case,
the
briefing
is
filled
with
whether
he
asked
in
time,
whether
he
was
delaying,
whether
he
should
have
done
some
other
thing,
whether
he
should
have
--
but
the
question
that's
asked
is
simply
whether
the
failure
to
fund
counsel
is
a
factor
that
should
be
weighed
against
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
maybe
it
only
gets
very
little
weight,
because
maybe
there
was
a
hurricane,
and
maybe
it
doesn't
even
matter
because
he
didn't
make
the
right
motions.
but
the
lower
court
said
it
shouldn't
be
weighed
against
the
state,
period.
and
do
we
have
to
do
anything
other
than
say,
if
you're
right,
yes,
it
should.
now,
how
much
weight
it
gets,
well,
that
depends.
there
was
a
hurricane
and
--
but
--
but
it's
something
that
they
can't
just
ignore
in
--
in
the
hearing.
they
have
to
figure
out
what
happened
and
to
the
extent
the
state
should
have
done
more,
it
weighs
against
the
state.
do
you
want
any
more
than
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
else--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
also
agree,
probably
on
this
subject,
but
the
only
sentence
that
i
can
find
--
i
haven't
read
it
totally
carefully
--
but
in
the
lower
court
opinion
that
has
to
do
with
this
is
the
sentence
that
i
read
before,
and
it
says:
"the
first
3
years
he
was
incarcerated,
he
was
charged
with
first-degree
murder,
and
the
progression
of
the
prosecution
was
out
of
the
state's
control,
as
determined
by
this
court
and
the
supreme
court.
"
now,
when
i
look
at
those
words,
i
am
not
100
percent
certain
what
they
mean,
so
it
would
be
helpful
--
but
i
don't
want
--
you're
not
going
to
do
it
--
but
i'd
like
to
--
are
you
--
would
you
concede
that
that
statement
means
they're
saying
that
the
state,
for
speedy
trial
purposes,
is
not
to
be
held
accountable
really
at
all
for
not
providing
the
money
insofar
as
that's
a
cause
of
the
delay?
is
that
a
conceded
point,
or
is
that
something
i
have
to
spend
quite
a
lot
of
time
going
through?
and
if
you
don't
concede
that,
what
is
it
that
you
concede,
which
would
spare
a
little
time
going
through
this
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
thought
maybe
you
would
not,
but--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
you
are
right.
most
of
this
opinion,
and
almost
all
of
it,
is
about
the
other
factors.
now,
i
agree
with
you,
that's
what
it
looked
like.
but
we
do
have
this
sentence,
so
how
am
i
supposed
to
figure
out
whether
that
sentence
really
means
what
they
say,
or
just
is
something
they
threw
in
to
make
the
opinion
more
difficult
for
us
to
understand?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
neither
do
i.
i
don't
doubt
it.
but
what's
the
argument
--
sounds
as
if
it
has
something
to
do
with
funding.
so
what's
the
argument
it
doesn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says,
you
see
--
"as
determined
by
this
court
and
the
supreme
court.
"
what
were
they
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
okay.
well,
then
that's
it.
they're
referring
to
barker.
okay.
so
when
they
say
it's
out
of
this
state's
control
as
referred
to
in
barker,
which
is
our
case,
then
what
they
mean
is
that
it's
not
something
that
the
state
had
anything
to
do
with,
so
they
shouldn't
be
blamed
for
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
agreed
with--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--suppose
it
is
negligent.
for
a
year,
this
person
isn't
represented
because
the
state
keeps
sending
the
checks
to
his
cousin
of
the
same
name.
i
mean,
you
know,
they
didn't
do
it
purposely.
he
just
happens
to
have
a
cousin,
this
lawyer,
of
the
same
name
who
doesn't
tell
him
he's
getting
these
checks
out
of
nowhere.
so
he
can't
hire
the
expert.
absolute
negligence.
i
mean,
that's
not
to
be
attributed
to
the
state?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
authority
for
that?
i
mean,
you
know,
maybe
you'd
discount
it
because
it
wasn't
deliberate,
but
no
attribution
whatsoever?
