bader

the
one
counsel
who
was
qualified,
what
was
his
name?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
lorenzi,
yes.
he
was
only
one
at
the
time
who
was
qualified
to
be
lead
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said,
you
don't
have
to
do
this.
you're
his
--
you're
his
attorney,
but
you
have
a
right
to
be
paid,
and
the
state
has
to
pay
you.
so
there
was
no
obligation
on
counsel's
part
to
do
anything;
and
he
kept
asking,
please
have
a
funding
order,
let
me
be
paid
and
i'll
do
my
job.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
like
us
to
say
what
judge
cook
said
in
her
opinion,
that
responsibility
for
funding
rests
with
the
state,
not
with
the
defendant.
once
an
attorney
is
appointed,
it
is
the
state's
obligation
to
ensure
that
adequate
funds
are
available
for
the
defense.
and
i
take
“
for
the
defense
”
to
mean
not
simply
counsel,
but
the
witnesses,
the
investigation.
it
is
certainly
true
that
none
of
the
delay
due
to
the
lack
of
funds
was
in
any
way
attributable
to
the
defense.
that's
essentially
what
you
would
like
us
to
say?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
clarify
one
point?
justice
scalia
said
something
about
a
defendant
facing
the
death
penalty
going
scot-free.
there
was
an
armed
robbery
charge
that
was
added
in
2007.
do
you
dispute
that
a
new
clock
started
in
2007,
the
first
time
that
the
robbery
charge
was
made?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
there
something
about
that
motion
was
withdrawn,
the
2005
motion
was
withdrawn
in
2006?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
--
on
that,
how
could
it
possibly
be
lorenzi's
fault,
which
is
what
you
said
is
your
first
point,
when
he
said:
pay
me.
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
you
have
said
that
my
operation
as
counsel
for
this
indigent
defendant
doesn't
become
operative
till
i
get
paid.
i
have
a
right
to
get
paid.
all
that
counsel
did
was
to
say
again
and
again:
pay
me;
get
the
funds
to
pay
me.
i
don't
understand
how
in
the
world
it
could
be
the
fault
of
an
attorney
who
has
not
gotten
one
cent
from
the
state,
has
a
right
to
be
paid
before
he
engages
in
representation
--
how
can
it
be
his
fault?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
boyer
was
--
had
a
limited
education
and
a
low
iq.
did
anyone
ever
counsel
him
about
this,
no,
you
don't
have
to
have
two
lawyers,
you
can
have
one?
did
any
judge
ever
tell
him
what
his
rights
were?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
the
level
of
his
education?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
was
expected
to
know
all
this
about
two
counsel
--
you
have
a
right
to
two
counsel
but
if
the
state
isn't
going
to
pay
them,
you
can
go
forward
with
one
counsel.
did
anyone
ever
tell
this
man
with
an
eighth
grade
education
what
his
rights
were?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
was
not
in
--
you
said
that
all
times,
he
had
at
least
two.
it
seemed
to
me
--
two
paid
counsel.
lorenzi
wasn't
paid,
so
it
was
singer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
then
the
woman,
lehman,
is
it?
but
when
she
started
representing
him,
she
didn't
have
the
qualifications
to
be
counsel.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
she
wouldn't
--
she
couldn't
be
appointed
counsel
in
a
death
case
under
louisiana's
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
from
the
very
beginning,
she
wasn't
even
qualified
to
do
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
court
itself
said
repeatedly
that
the
cause
of
the
delay
was
the
funding
crisis.
the
court
said.
i
think
we
have
to
accept
that
as
being
the
case,
that
the
funding
crisis
--
the
effort
to
get
this
lawyer
paid
failed
time
and
again.
and
it
was
the
court's
determination
that
it
is
the
funding
crisis
that
caused
the
delay.
