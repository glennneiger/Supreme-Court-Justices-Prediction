elena
kagan
mr.
bourke,
did
anyone--
justice
elena
kagan
but
how
do
we
know
that?
how
do
we
know
that
they
would
have
reach
the
same
determination
if
they
had
gotten
it
right
on
that
single
factor?
justice
elena
kagan
whether
something
is--
justice
elena
kagan
--whether
something
is
the
state's
fault
is
a
significant
factor
in
the
analysis,
and
we
have
made
that
very
clear
in
our
cases,
and
so
if
they
got
that
wrong
--
and
you,
i
think
quite
rightly,
are
saying
we
can't
defend
that
part
of
it
--
if
they
got
that
wrong
don't
we
at
least
have
to
say,
okay,
well,
get
it
right
now
and
do
it
again?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
sigler,
on
appeal
you
said
this,
the
--
the
state
said:
because
the
defendant
was
without
properly
funded
counsel
for
so
long,
the
state
simply
could
not
ethically
or
legally
bring
him
to
trial.
so
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
that,
that
the
state
could
not
ethically
or
legally
bring
him
to
trial?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
did
you
ever
say
to
mr.
boyer,
you
know,
you
can
go
ahead
right
now
with
this
single
counsel
that
you
have?
was
that
ever
a
choice
put
to
him?
or
because
--
the
way
i
read
all
of
your
assertions
below,
and
indeed
the
entire
record
below,
is
that
everybody
simply
assumed
that
the
case
could
not
go
forward
in
its
present
circumstances.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
a
decision
implies
a
choice.
was
a
choice
ever
put
to
him?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
didn't
even
know
that.
you
said
the
state
could
not
ethically
or
legally
bring
him
to
trial.
how
was
he
supposed
to
know
that?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
sigler,
could
you
go
back
to
justice
alito's
question?
justice
elena
kagan
that
was
a
big
segue.
do
you
have
it--
justice
elena
kagan
--when
we
said
in
brillon,
delays
resulting
from
a
systemic
breakdown
in
the
public
defender
system
could
be
charged
to
the
state.
so
that
suggests
systemic
breakdown
doesn't
necessarily
mean
deliberate.
it
just
means
there
has
been
a
breakdown,
and
the
result
is
that
the
person
can't
get
to
trial.
and
i
think
--
if
justice
alito
could
even
read
that
again,
and
if
you
think
about
it
in
light
of
this
statement
in
brillon,
the
systemic
breakdowns
are
systemic
breakdowns,
whether
or
not
they
are
deliberate.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
boyer
--
why
would--
justice
elena
kagan
--why
would
we
get
to
that
question?
i
mean,
no
courts
below
have
dealt
with
it.
it
has
been
briefed
to
us
in
a
grand
total
of
two
paragraphs,
i
think.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
us
to
get
to
that
question.
justice
elena
kagan
so
--
so
from
that
point
of
view,
we
can
assume
that
there
is
a
robbery
conviction
that
is
still
out
there.
