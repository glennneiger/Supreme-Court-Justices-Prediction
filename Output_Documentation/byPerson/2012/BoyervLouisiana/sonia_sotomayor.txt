justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
think
what
you
--
let's
go
back
to
that.
it
was
his
view
that
under
louisiana
law
to
assert
his
sixth
amendment
right,
he
had
to
follow
the
procedure
laid
out
in
the
louisiana
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
under
the
sixth
amendment,
he
had
to
comply
with
the
requirements,
the
procedural
requirements
of
louisiana.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
then
how
do
you
--
if
he
couldn't
do
it
in
2002,
'03,
'04
or
'05,
how
did
he
end
up
doing
it
in
'05?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
didn't
he
move
to
quash
earlier?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
is
there
a
law
or
a
regulation
in
--
in
louisiana
that
gives
it
a
3-year
mark?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
the
reasoning,
is
delay
because
of
the
lack
of
funding
attributable
to
the
state
or
not,
or
to
the
district
attorney
as
agent
of
the
state?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what's
wrong
with
what's
been
suggested
by
some,
to
remand
to
tell
the
court
below
to
whatever
extent
this
was
the
basis
of
your
decision,
it
was
wrong.
now
redo
the
barker,
the
factors.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
one
factor
determinative
always
in
this
calculation?
i
thought
it
was
a
weighing
factor,
and
so
if
it's
a
weighing
factor,
why
isn't
that
in
and
of
itself
a
factor
that
a
court
needs
to
weigh
against
the
others?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
wait
a
minute.
this
is
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
doesn't
he
say
at
the
same
time,
i
couldn't
do
the
investigation
to
make
the
motion
required
by
the
state?
so
didn't
that
implicate
the
funding
for
investigation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
were
there
funds
for
investigation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
funds?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
wait
a
minute.
i
was
told
--
maybe
i
am
sort
of
misreading
this
record
--
that
he
was
ultimately
told
that
fund
wouldn't
be
made
available.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
do
you
want
to
define
constitutionally
adequate
counsel?
is
it
anybody
who's
graduated
from
harvard
and
yale?
[laughter]
or
even
just
passed
the
bar?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
would
think
--
no,
no,
no.
this
is
a
very
serious
question,
which
is,
i
don't
know
that
we
have
ever
defined
what
the
minimum
qualification
is
for
qualified
counsel.
but
it
is
--
some
of
it
has
to
be
that
counsel
themselves
feel
adequate
to
represent
a
capital
defendant.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know
plenty
of
lawyers
who
would
never
either
volunteer
or
would
resist
being
appointed
to
take
on
that
kind
of
case,
because
it
has
many
differences
to
a
normal
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
she's
a
very
experienced
trial
counsel.
there's
no
--
no
doubt
of
that,
but
was
she
a
capital
counsel?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
what's
the
difference
between
saying
i'm
broke
and
i
want
to
pay
the
prosecutor,
because
they
kept
paying
the
prosecutor,
i
want
to
pay
for
the
prosecutor's
investigation,
but
i
won't
pay
you?
what
--
what
is
the
difference
in
applying
the
negligence
versus
deliberate
standard?
i
mean,
look,
in
the
end,
states
are
always
strapped,
but
i
don't
know
a
state
who
doesn't
make
some
income.
they
make
a
choice
about
where
they
want
that
income
to
go.
and
it
may
be
in
your
judgment
a
more
legitimate
decision,
but
why
is
the
situation
less
negligent
--
why
is
it
negligent
and
not
deliberate?
why
is
the
choice
one,
not
the
other.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
then
answer
the
question.
why
isn't
the
choice
to
say,
i'm
broke,
so
i
don't
want
to
pay
you,
i'm
going
to
pay
the
prosecutor,
which
happens
--
the
prosecutors
were
being
paid
throughout.
they
had
enough
money
to
investigate,
but
we're
choosing
not
to
pay
the
defendants.
why
isn't
that
a
deliberate
choice?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
available
funds
to
pay
the
lawyer?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
going
to
argue
the
funding
issue
because
i've
got
to
go
look
at
the
record
again.
but
let's
assume
that
the
record
doesn't
support
your
claim,
because
as
i
read
the
decisions
below
and
the
record
that
i
saw
there
wasn't
funding
available
until
i
think
it
was
2006
or
'07?
and
so
somehow,
there's
a
disconnect
between
what
you're
saying
and
the
record.
but
let's
assume
that
--
my
hypothetical,
that
there
wasn't
money
despite
whatever
you're
saying.
what's
your
position
then?
then
it's
not
deliberate?
it's
still
negligence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
there
could
never
be
a
systematic
breakdown
in
your
judgment,
because
any
time
the
state
gives
resources
to
something
else,
it's
not
deliberate
--
it's
not
a
systemic
breakdown.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there
was
money
allocated,
but
if
i
understood
the
record
correctly
--
by
the
state
--
the
funding
was
grossly
inadequate
to
cover
all
the
needs?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
to
the
murder
or
as
to
the
independent
robbery
count?
it's
not
a
lesser
included
offense,
the
robbery
count.
