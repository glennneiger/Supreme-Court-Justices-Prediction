justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bourke,
was
it
within
the
control
of
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
he
unable
to
get
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
speedy
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
--
he
had
one
counsel,
right?
during
the
whole
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
part
of
it
he
had
two,
and
then
there
was
not
enough
funding
for
the
second,
okay?
so
he
was
faced
with
a
choice.
louisiana,
as
i
understand
it,
has
adopted
a
provision
which
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
require.
the
sixth
amendment
just
requires
counsel,
but
louisiana
says,
in
capital
cases
we
are
going
to
provide
two
counsel,
and
you
can't
go
to
trial
until
you
have
two
counsel,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
state
of
louisiana
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
that.
that's
not
louisiana
law
that
you
--
that
you
can't
proceed
without
two
counsel?
that's
not
the
law
in
louisiana?
i
thought
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
--
you
don't
consider
supreme
court
rules
to
be
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
fact
that
in
louisiana
you
cannot
proceed
to
trial
in
a
capital
case
unless
there
are
two
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
don't
have
a
case.
you
should
have
proceeded
to
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
there
at
all
times
one
counsel
who
was
being
paid
by
the
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
all
times?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
counsel
qualified
enough
under
our
constitutional
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
the
question
is,
would
only
lead
counsel
under
--
under
the
supreme
court's
rule
qualify
as
competent
counsel
for
purposes
of
complying
with
the
constitutional
requirement?
or
would
this
certified
second
chair
qualify?
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly.
i'm
just
saying,
can
you
establish
that
the
one
counsel
that
your
client
had
throughout
this
whole
--
whole
proceeding
would
not
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement?
can
you
--
is
there
any
basis
for
your
saying
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
because
of
a
federal
constitutional
reason;
the
court
found
you
are
not
complying
with
the
supreme
court
rule.
you
can't
proceed
without
complying
with
the
supreme
court
rule.
it
seems
to
me
your
client
was
faced
with
a
choice.
you
could
either
demand
what
louisiana
in
its
generosity
has
given
to
capital
defendants,
namely
the
right
to
two
counsel,
whether
it's
by
statute
or
by
supreme
court
rule,
it
doesn't
matter.
you
can
either
demand
that
right,
or
you
could
demand
your
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
that
was
your
choice.
and
it
seems
to
me
what
counsel
chose
was
to
insist
all
along,
i
want
my
right
to
two
--
to
two
counsel.
you
didn't
have
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
didn't
have
to
take
that
right.
you
could
have
gone
to
the
supreme
court
and
said,
you
know,
since
it's
taking
so
long,
i
demand
my
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
but
you
didn't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
a
finding
by
the
district
court,
or
whichever
court
found
it,
that
there
was
not
enough
money
to
pay
counsel,
to
investigate,
and
to
do
whatever
else
--
buy
stamps
--
is
not
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
there
was
not
enough
money
to
investigate
and
to
buy
stamps.
counsel
was
a
part
of
that
mix.
you
never
had
a
finding
that
there
was
not
enough
money
to
pay
counsel,
right?
or
--
i'm
sorry,
that
there
was
not
enough
money
to
allow
the
counsel
that
has
been
appointed
to
investigate
and
buy
stamps.
was
there
ever
any
such
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the
big
tag
item
was
paying
counsel,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
enough
that
none
of
the
delay
was
attributable
to
the
defense.
the
defense
has
to
complain,
has
to
demand
its
right
to
a
prompt
trial.
what
did
your
client
do?
frankly,
i
am
skeptical
that
a
capital
defendant
who
has
already
confessed
to
the
crime
wants
to
be
tried
as
soon
as
possible.
i'm
skeptical
about
that.
now,
what
--
what
did
your
client
do
to
demand
his
right
to
a
prompt
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
--
surely
that's
unconstitutional.
did
counsel
say,
i
demand
a
speedy
trial?
you
can't
condition
my
right
to
a
speedy
trial
upon
my
getting
some
affidavit
or
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
still
waiting
for
anybody
telling
the
court:
i
demand
a
speedy
trial,
and
if
i
don't
get
a
speedy
trial,
you
are
violating
the
constitution
and
i
ought
to
go
scot-free.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
quite.
i
mean,
the
question
presented
is
not
as
general
as
that.
it's
much
more
fact-bound.
it
says
whether
a
state's
failure
to
fund
counsel
for
an
indigent
for
5
years,
particularly
where
failure
was
the
direct
result
of
the
prosecution's
choice
to
seek
the
death
penalty
should
be
weighed
against
the
state
for
speedy
trial
purposes.
i
think
this
is
inviting
us
to
look
into
the
facts
of
this
case
and
decide
whether
this
5-year
delay,
particularly
since
the
prosecution
chose
the
death
penalty
--
you
know,
i
don't
like
having
to
do
that
and
--
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
the
question
presented
at
least
requires.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
requires
such
a
motion.
i
mean,
i
don't
care
whether
they
have
a,
you
know,
a
speedy
trial
motion.
if
denying
him
the
right
to
speedy
trial
violates
the
constitution,
surely
he
is
entitled
to
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
louisiana
court,
whether
there's
a
specific
statutory
or
rule
provision
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
they
--
they
don't
even
want
counsel
to
say,
you
know,
your
honor,
we've
been
trying
to
get
funding,
and
we're
just
sick
and
tired
of
waiting
for
this.
we
demand
a
speedy
trial,
and
if
we
don't
get
funding
and
therefore
don't
get
a
speedy
trial,
we
think
there's
a
constitutional
violation
and
we're
going
to
ask
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed.
nobody
ever
made
a
statement
like
that
to
the
court,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
dismissing
it
instead
of
withdrawing
it,
that's
the
fine
line
he's
drawing?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
line
in
louisiana
law?
i
don't
know.
does
this
--
this
come
from
french
law
or
something?
it
seems
to
me
withdrawing
and
dismissing
sound
to
me
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
withdrawing
his
motion
to
quash.
so
it
was
withdrawn,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
going
to
ask
you
that
question.
opposing
counsel
said
that
it
--
it
wasn't
primarily
attorney's
fees
that's
at
issue
here
but
investigation
costs.
that
makes
a
difference
to
me
because
if
it's
just
attorney's
fees
he
could
have
gone
ahead
with
one
attorney
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
statement
meant
could
not
ethically
or
legally
bring
him
to
trial
while
he
is
insisting
on
his
right
to
two
counsel.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
been
different
if
he
had
said,
the
devil
with
the
second
counsel,
i
want
a
--
i
want
a
prompt
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
would
have
felt
that
legally
and
ethically,
you
could
proceed.
justice
antonin
scalia
his
one
counsel
might
have
known.
he
did
have
one
counsel.
he
had
one
counsel,
because
he
only
graduated
from
the
eighth
grade.
that's
why
we
provide
counsel.
and
that
counsel
could
have
known,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
she
was
a
graduate
of
yale
law
school,
wasn't
she?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
another
of
his
counsel,
mr.
singer
--
of
the
three
that
he
had
--
he
was
a
graduate
of
harvard
law
school,
wasn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
son
of
a
gun.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bourke,
would
you
respond
to
the
last
point
made
by
--
by
opposing
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
did
state,
it's
in
appendix
j,
even
if
the
murder
indictment
were
quashed,
mr.
boyer
faces
the
armed
robbery
prosecution.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
told
us
today
that
that's
not
the
case,
that
the
armed
robbery
prosecution
goes
down
the
drain.
which
is
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
assume
there
isn't,
right?
