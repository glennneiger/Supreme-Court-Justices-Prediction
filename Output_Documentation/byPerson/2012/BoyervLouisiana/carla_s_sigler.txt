ms.
carla
s.
sigler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
should
affirm
the
holding
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
three
separate
reasons.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
justice
sotomayor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
funding
--
that
we
can
credibly
argue
that
funding
is
completely
outside
the
role
of
the
state.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
your
honor,
if
you
review
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
opinion,
which
is
at
appendix
d,
the
other
barker
factors
are
analyzed
incredibly
thoroughly
with
a
mind
to
this
court's
jurisprudence,
and
the
rationale
may
be
flawed
with
regard
to
that
one
point
in
this
court's
opinion,
but
the
result
is
not.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
i
think
that
this
court
has
always
acknowledged
in
its
barker
v.
wingo
jurisprudence
that
there
is
no
one
talismanic
factor;
all
of
the
factors
are
interrelated
and
all
are
reviewed.
and
that
is
why,
even
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
one
assessment
of
the
third
circuit's
opinion,
the
result
is
sound.
with--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--i
think
when
you
look
at
the
third
circuit
of
appeals
opinion,
they
specifically
and
with
direct
quotations
to
barker
v.
wingo,
go
through
every
other
factor
in
the
analysis,
and
they
discuss
the
fact
of
the
repeated
continuances
of
defense
counsel
of
his
own
funding
motion
as
part
of
the
assertion
of
the
right.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
justice
kagan,
i
don't
think
that
what
i
would
say
is
they
got
it
completely
wrong,
because,
as
this
court
has
acknowledged
throughout
its
barker
jurisprudence,
there
are
different
weights
you
attribute
to
government
action,
whether
it
is
negligence
or
whether
it
is
a
deliberate
attempt
on
behalf
of
the
state
to
evade
giving
a
defendant
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
yes,
sir,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
the
first
reason
is
that,
as
in
vermont
v.
brillon,
the
delay
occasioned
in
this
case
was
due
to
petitioner's
counsel's
repeated
requests
to
continue
his
own
funding
motion,
which
delayed
a
source
of
funding
when
the
petitioner
wished
to
proceed
with
capital-certified
counsel.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
the
second
reason,
your
honor,
would
be,
pursuant
to
loud
hawk,
even
if
this
court
determines
that
there
was
a
negligence
factor
with
regard
to
the
state
of
louisiana
in
not
properly
funding
capital-certified
counsel,
there
are
valid
policy
interests
at
play
here;
and
the
fact
that
louisiana
is
generous
enough
to
provide
specially
certified
counsel
to
capital
indigent
defendants
when
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
for
it
to
do
so.
and
then
our
third
argument,
your
honor,
would
be
that,
based
under
the
barker
v.
wingo
jurisprudence,
the
delay
should
not
be
attributed
to
the
state
in
this
case
because
of
petitioner's
failure
to
meaningfully
assert
his
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
and--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--yes,
sir.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
several
reasons
why
it's
mr.
lorenzi's
fault,
the
first
of
which
is
he
filed
a
motion
under
state
v.
wigley
and
that
is
appendix
x
of
your
joint
appendix.
in
that
motion
he
identified
state
v.
wigley
and,
although
he
referenced
wanting
expert
resources
as
well,
he
primarily
based
that
motion
on
his
entitlement
to
attorney's
fees.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
and
if
you
look
at
appendix
ll,
which
is
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
quash,
mr.
lorenzi
says
point
blank
in
that
appendix,
he
says:
i
was
not
going
to
file
substantive
motions
until
i
was
funded.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
justice
sotomayor,
if
you
look
at
appendix
ll
where
mr.
lorenzi
is
speaking,
he
says
"i
have
done
substantial
investigation
on
my
own.
"
mr.
lorenzi
had
the
assistance
at
that
time
of
the
lcac
with
ms.
christine
lehmann
assisting
him
as
associate
counsel.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
there
were
funds
available
in
2003
that
mr.
lorenzi
did
not
avail
himself
of
because
he
continued
his
funding
motion
eight
times.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
there
was
a
capital
defense
account
that
was
held
by
the
calcasieu
parish
public
defender's
office.
mr.
lorenzi
identified
that
account
as
a
source
of
funding
in
record
volume
1,
pages
193
to
194.
he
says
in
a
letter
to
judge
david
painter,
then
the
presiding
trial
judge,
that
he
has
identified
a
source
of
funds
for
his
representation.
in
that
same
letter
he
moves
to
continue
a
funding
hearing
that
was
at
that
time
scheduled
for
the
next
month.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
if
you
read
appendix
ll,
chief
public
defender
wonwer
testifies
that
that
fund
had
been
used
to
pay
other
capital
counsel
in
calcasieu
parish.
it
had
been
used
extensively.
now,
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
funding
hearing,
which
was
delayed
because
of
mr.
lorenzi,
we
are
in
2006.
at
that
time
there
is
a
backlog
in
expenses
that
they
are
paying
other
capital
counsel,
because
they
pay
their
bills
on
a
first
come,
first
served
basis.
had
mr.
lorenzi
proceeded
to
hearing
in
2003,
there
was
an
identified
account
that
would
have
paid
him.
he
did
not
submit
any
bills
to
the
public
defender's
office
to
be
paid.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
justice
kagan,
what
that
statement
meant
was
that
we
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
at
all
times
urging
his
privilege
under
rule
31
to
capital-certified
counsel.
we
did
not
want
to
be
involved
in
the
business
of
questioning
a
petitioner's
right
to
counsel.
we
did
not
feel
that
ethically
we
could
do
so
under
the
rules
of
professional
conduct.
for
us
to
interfere
with
that
right
would
have
been
inappropriate
in
our
view.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
justice
kagan,
i
think
that
that
assumption
was
made
in
part
out
of
a
desire
to
recognize
mr.
boyer's
decision
to
try
to
pursue
rule
31
privileges.
it's
certainly
--
i
understand
that
we
could
have--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--he
had
a
choice
that
was
implicit,
your
honor,
under
louisiana
law;
and
he
knew
that
and
his
counsel
certainly
knew
that.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
justice
kagan,
our
response
in
that
particular
phrase
that
you
are
speaking
of
has
to
do
with
our
response
to
how
the
petitioner
has
phrased
this
issue
all
along.
the
petitioner
has
continuously
phrased
this
issue
as
if
he
had
a
right
to
capital-certified
counsel,
and
in
fact
in
his
reply
brief
that
is
what
he
states.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
that's
correct.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
it's
interesting
that
petitioner
argued
that
here
today,
because
under
article
71
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
while
an
affidavit
is
listed
in
the
statute
as
one
requirement,
as
a
matter
of
course,
motions
for
speedy
trial
are
granted
pro
se
all
the
time
that
meet
none
of
the
requirements
in
that
statute.
in
addition,
rule
31
does
not
say
that
a
defendant
who
is
trying
to
avail
himself
of
rule
31
can't
file
a
motion
for
a
speedy
trial.
it
says
nothing
to
that
effect.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
first
like
to
address
that
i
do
not
believe
the
petitioner
has
a
low
iq.
in
fact,
that
was
refuted
by
our
dr.
charles
robertson
at
a
competency
proceeding.
in
fact,
the
result
that
was
given
from
an
iq
test
was
15,
the
person
administering
it
specifically
stated
that
he
was
malingering,
which
would
cause
a
10-point
drop
in
the
iq--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--i
believe
his
level
of
education
was
eighth
grade.
but
i
would--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
believe
that
that
specific
discussion
was
ever
had--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--absolutely.
in
fact,
mr.
lorenzi
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
could
have
chosen,
the
petitioner
could
have
chosen,
to
proceed
with
just
one
counsel.
but
i'd
also
like
to
note,
justice
scalia,
that
from
2002
to
2004,
he
had
three
counsel.
he
had
mr.
lorenzi,
he
had
mr.
steven
singer
and
he
had
miss
christine
lehman.
he
didn't
just
have
one,
he
had
three.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
justice
ginsburg,
as
has
been
alluded
to
before,
i
believe
by
justice
scalia,
she
absolutely
had
the
qualifications
to
serve
as
counsel
as
required
by
the
sixth
amendment.
and--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--she
met
the
qualifications
for
associate
counsel.
in
fact,
she
was
later
certified
in
a
motion
filed
by
mr.
lorenzi
to
be
associate
counsel--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--well,
there
was
a
provision
--
there
is
a
provision
in
louisiana
law
that
allows
someone
to
move
for
the
admission
and
the
certification
of
somebody
as
capital
counsel,
which
was
the
procedure
employed
in
this
case.
that
is
perfectly
permissible.
but
miss
lehman
at
that
time
was
a
very
experienced
attorney,
and
we
lay
out
her
qualifications
in
the
brief.
so
while
she
may
not
have
been
perfectly
qualified
under
rule
31
to
serve
as
lead
counsel,
she
was
certainly
more
than
qualified--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--she's
a
very
impressive
attorney.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
i
would
refute
that,
justice
thomas.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
or
lsu
law.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
sotomayor,
but
i
would
invite
you
to
look
at
the
motion
that
moved
for
the
certification
of
ms.
lehman,
which
is
in
the
record.
that
motion--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--she
was,
your
honor.
that
motion
specifically
refers
to
the
seven
capital
cases
she
had
worked
on,
and
states
that
while
at
the
lcac,
the
louisiana
capital
assistance
center,
she
had
worked
on
other
capital
cases
in
advisory
positions.
so
she--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--if
the
failure
to
provide
funding
is
a
deliberate
attempt
on
the
state
to
interfere
with
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
then
i
would
agree
with
that.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
justice
breyer,
i
regret
to
inform
you
that
i
do
not
concede
that
point.
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the--
[laughter]
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
i
believe
if
you
look
at
appendix
d,
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
other
barker
factors
are
discussed,
and
the
continuance
motions
that
were
filed
by
defense
counsel
are
mentioned
with
regard
to
the
assertion
of
the
right,
but
not
necessarily
mentioned
with
regard
to
the
state.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
i
don't
think
that
was
the
stated
--
the
intention
of
the
third
circuit.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
i
believe--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--well,
i
believe
what
the
third
circuit
was
referring
to
was
this
court's
barker
v.
wingo
jurisprudence.
this
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
even
if
something--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--i
think
that
they
are
attempting
in
some
fashion
to
reconcile
some
of
this
court's
later
statements
in
the
barker
jurisprudence,
which
this
court
made
it
clear
in
vermont
v.
brillon
that
certain
actions
are
not
going
to
be
attributed
to
the
state
for
speedy
trial
purposes--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
absolutely.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
i
think
that
this
court
has
always
recognized
in
the
barker
jurisprudence
that
negligence
is
a
very
different
factor
in
how
it
weighs
against
a
state
than
a
deliberate
attempt
to
violate
a
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
justice
kagan,
i
think
that
the
best
evidence
or
the
fact
that
there
was
no
systemic
breakdown
is
the
funding
hearing
itself,
appendix
jj.
at
that
funding
hearing
there
are
extensive
discussions
about
other
capital
cases
within
the
state
that
are
being
tried
the
entire
time
this
case
was
pending,
including
one
case
that
we
referred
to,
state
v.
reeves
in
calcasieu
parish,
a
capital
case
that
went
to
trial
in
less
than
4
years,
that
included
a
retrial.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
i
think
from
that
scenario,
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
state's
intention.
i
certainly
think
that
if
the
state
flat
out
said,
i'm
sorry,
you're
not
getting
counsel
for
a
year,
then
we
would
have
to
attribute
that
factor
to
the
state
more
heavily,
even
though
it
does
appear
that
in
your
scenario
it's
more
of
a
negligence
problem
than
a
deliberate
we're
not
going
to
fund
you
problem.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
no,
justice
breyer.
clearly--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--well,
you
discount
it,
justice
breyer,
and
you
attribute
it
to
more
of
a
negligence
standard
than
you
would
a
--
an
absolute
failure
or
refusal
to
provide
counsel.
and
this
court
has
done
that
repeatedly.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
justice
sotomayor,
i
believe
in
this
court's
decisions
under
barker
v.
wingo
the
choice
aspect,
the
deliberate
intent
aspect,
has
been
looked
at
by
the
courts
in
deciding
how
much
of
the
blame
is
to
be
assessed
against
the
state.
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
well,
justice
sotomayor,
that
choice
was
not
made
in
this
case.
there
was
available
funds.
what
we're
here
--
we're
today--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--there
were
available
funds
in
2003.
i
was
referring
to
that
letter
in
the
record
that--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
funding
crisis
that
the
court
ruled
on
was
present
in
2006.
it
was
not
present
in
2003,
when
this
case
started.
mr.
lorenzi
himself
identified
a
source
of
funds
to
pay
him.
and
when
we
hear
chief
public
defender
ron
ware
testify
at
that
motion
for
funding
hearing
at
appendix
jj,
he
says:
yes,
i
have
a
special
capital
defense
account;
and
yes,
i
have
been
paying
capital
attorneys
from
this
account
throughout
this
time
period.
the
fact
that
there
weren't
funds
available
readily
in
2006
is
directly
attribute
to
petitioner's
counsel's
failing
to
move
his
funding
herein
forward
in
2003,
when
he
first
identified
that
source
of
funds.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
was
never
any
funding.
this
was
a
case
in
which
defense
counsel,
for
whatever
reason,
delayed
a
resolution
of
the
funding
issue,
an
issue
that
he
himself
identified
as
one,
without
any
resolution
he
was
not
going
to
go
forward
with
substantive
motions.
the
onus,
the
blame
or
more
of
the
blame
in
this
case
on
the
funding
problem
belongs
with
the
petitioner,
not
the
state
of
louisiana,
whether
we
mean
the
prosecution--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--justice
sotomayor,
i
maintain
that
position,
and
i
believe
it
to
be
consistent
with
this
court's
repeated
analysis
under
barker
v.
wingo
jurisprudence.
you
do
look
at
the
intent
of
the
state
as
either
a
negligence
factor,
akin
to
more
of
a
neutral
factor,
a
deliberate
factor,
or

the
delay.
and
i
would
also
suggest
to
your
honor--
ms.
carla
s.
sigler
--justice
sotomayor,
i
would
invite
you
to
look
at
the
motion
for
funding
hearing
again.
there
was
money
allocated
to
indigent
defense
by
louisiana.
it
has
increased,
and
this
is
public
record
and
it's
partially
supported
by
the
funding
hearing.
that
money
has
increased
from
9.4
million
in
2006
to
20
million
in
2
--
i'm
sorry
--
in
2005
to
20
million
in
2006
to
$33
million
today.

that
is
the
precise
amount
prosecutors
are
awarded
by
the
state.
i
would,
again,
suggest
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
systemic
breakdown.
and
i
think
that
as
a
policy
matter,
this
court
should
be
reluctant
to
rule
against
the
state
of
louisiana,
which
as
justice
scalia
noted,
has
been
so
generous
in
trying
to
provide
capital
indigent
defendants
with
specially
qualified
counsel,
which
is
more
counsel
than
they're
even
entitled
to
under
the
sixth
amendment.
and
i
would
also
urge
this
court
to
be
cognizant
of
its
own
repeated
statements
in
the
past
that
this
is
a
very
severe
remedy
with
regard
to
letting
a
convicted
murderer
free.
i'd
also
like
to
address
before
i
sit
down
and
turn
this
back
over
to
mr.
bourke,
justice
ginsburg,
earlier
you
had
addressed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
armed
robbery
was
in
fact
still
a
valid
charge.
contrary
to
mr.
bourke's
assertion
before
your
honor
today,
if
you
look
at
appendix
254a,
there
is
a
writ
of
opposition
that
was
filed
by
the
petitioner
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
and
at
254a
he
says,
and
i
quote:
"even
if
the
murder
indictment
were
quashed,
mr.
boyer
faces
the
armed
robbery
prosecution.
"
the
third
circuit
also
rejected
mr.
bourke's
current
double
jeopardy
argument
and
stated
specifically
that
there
was
no
speedy
trial
problem
with
regard
to
the
armed
robbery.
thank
you.
