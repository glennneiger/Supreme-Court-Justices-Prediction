argument
next
this

boyer
v.
louisiana.
mr.
bourke?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
much
money
would
be
needed
for
investigation
and
experts
before
you
would
acknowledge
that
that
would
be
competent
representation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean,
justice
alito's
problem
seemed
to
me,
to
get
back
to
justice
scalia's
point,
is
that
he
seemed
more
interested
in
the
funding
than
a
speedy
trial.
the
funding
that
would
be
provided
by
the
state
under
its
procedures.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
as
justice
alito
pointed
out
on
several
occasions,
what
the
defense
lawyer
said
was,
let's
put
it
off
and
see
if
we
can
get
funding,
let's
put
it
off
until
there's
the
funding
hearing.
let's
put
it
off
and
put
it
off
as
opposed
to
saying,
i
want
a
speedy
trial,
i'm
entitled
to
it
now,
if
you
don't
have
the
money,
i
don't
get
a
speedy
trial,
i
get
off
scot-free.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

you,
counsel.

go
to
trial?
