isn't
it
true
that
you
waited
3
years
before
doing
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
we
provide
--
if
we
provide
that
guidance,
what
do
we
do
about
the
continuances
that
mr.
lorenzi
requested
that
relate
to
the
funding?
january
10,
2003,
lorenzi
requests
a
continuance
of
funding
hearing
citing
scheduling
problems.
august
5,
2003,
lorenzi
moves
to
continue
hearing
on
motion
to
designate
source
of
funds
so
that
the
indigent
defender
board
can
consider
funding
boyer's
case
at
an
august
26
meeting.
so
this
is
--
okay.
lorenzi
moves
to
continue
september
12,
2003.
lorenzi
moves
to
continue
hearing
on
motion
to
designate
funds
in
trial
so
that
the
idb
may
again
consider
the
funding
defense
at
its
next
meeting.
december
15,
lorenzi
moves
to
continue
hearing
on
motion
to
designate
funds,
et
cetera.
there
are
many
of
these
motions.
what
do
we
do
with
those?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
let
me
--
let
me
give
you
a
holding
--
this
is
an
incredibly
factually
complicated
case.
we
don't
usually
take
cases
that
are
so
fact-bound,
but
we've
taken
it.
[laughter]
let
me
give
you
a
rule
that
we
might
adopt:
if
the
failure
to
provide
funding
makes
it
impossible
for
some
period
of
time
for
a
case
to
be
tried,
then
the
delay
is
attributable
to
the
state.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
agreed
with
the
--
the
principle
that
i
mentioned,
except
that
you
want
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
failure
to
provide
funding
and
the
deliberate
failure
to
provide
funding?
is
that
a
real
difference?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
the
state
inadvertently
failed
to
provide
funding?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
if
you
have
a
case
where
the
defendant
wants
counsel,
can't
afford
counsel,
and
the
state
says:
we'd
love
to
provide
counsel
for
you,
but
we're
broke;
we
just
don't
have
any
money
to
provide
counsel;
but
maybe
in
a
year
we'll
have
money
to
provide
counsel.
now,
what
do
we
do
with
the
delay
between
that
point
and
--
and
the
--
the
point
a
year
later
when
the
money
becomes
available?
