justice
anthony

am
i
correct
or
incorrect
that
a
considerable
number
of
these
roads
are
--
a
significant
number
of
these
roads
were
built
initially
by
the
logging
industry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
a
little
hard
for
you
to
say
that
when
these
were
built
by
the
logging
industry
and
presumably
maintained
to
some
respect
by
the
logging
industry,
to
say,
oh,
well,
these
are
used
by
hunters
and
so
forth.
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
submission
that
we
should
issue
an
order
vacating
this
moot
or
issue
an
order
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
whether
it's
moot?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
submission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
in
other
words,
it
goes
--
under
your
view,
it
would
go
back
to
the
district
court;
the
district
court
would
try
all
this;
and,
as
the
chief
justice
says,
we
know
what
the
law
of
the
case
is,
if
--
if
the
opinion
stands.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
so
isn't
--
isn't
it
fairly
clear,
well,
we
know
that
the
district
court
must
do
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
excuse
me.
this
is
page
18.
that's
the
last
page.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
so
i'm
reading
under
where
it
says
“
stormwater
discharges
”?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
--
but
then
why
--
why
isn't
your
--
aren't
your
concerns
met
if
we
vacate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
in
the
first
instance
the
extent
to
which
this
regulation
may
bear
on
its
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
opinion
is
in
the
cases
of
decker
versus
northwestern
--
northwest
environmental
defense
center,
and
georgia
pacific
west
versus
northwest
environmental
defense
center.
the
clean
water
act
established
a
general
rule
that
permits
are
required
before
pollutants
may
be
discharged
from
any
point
source
into
the
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states.
congress
later
amended
the
act
to
exempt
most
discharges
composed
entirely
of
stormwater
because
there
is
so
much
stormwater.
a
few
types
of
stormwater
discharges,
however,
still
require
permits.
as
relevant
here,
permits
are
required
for
stormwater
discharges
that
are
associated
with
industrial
activity.
and
the
term
“associated
with
industrial
activity”
covers
only
discharges
under
the
statute,
directly
related
to
manufacturing,
processing
or
raw
materials
storage
areas
at
an
industrial
plant.
petitioner
georgia-pacific
has
a
contract
with
oregon
to
harvest
timber
from
a
state
forest,
west
of
portland,
oregon.
it
rains
a
lot
in
this
part
of
oregon,
in
some
places
more
than
100
inches
a
year,
so
water
runs
off
to
logging
roads
used
by
the
petitioner
and
into
the
ditches
and
culverts,
and
channels
that
discharge
the
water
into
nearby
streams
and
rivers.
and
the
discharge
often
contains
sediment
that
may
be
harmful
to
fish
or
other
aquatic
organisms.
respondent
northwest
environmental
defense
center
filed
suit
against
georgia-pacific
and
state
and
local
governments
and
officials
and
alleged
that
the
defendant
should
have
obtained
permits
before
discharging
stormwater
runoff
from
the
logging
roads.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
discharges
from
the
logging
roads
did
require
permits.
that
is
because,
in
their
view,
they
were
associated
with
industrial
activity.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
contrary
to
the
epa's
interpretation
of
its
regulation.
now,
just
before
the
oral
argument
in
these
cases,
the
epa
issued
a
final
version
of
an
amendment
to
its
storm
--
to
its
industrial
stormwater
rule.
and
that
amendment
clarified
that
the
permit
requirement
applies
only
to
a
certain
subset
of
logging
operations,
but
not
the
logging
roads
like
the
ones
here.
the
new
regulation
does
not
make
these
cases
moot.
the
preamendment
version
of
the
regulation
governed
the
petitioner's
past
discharges.
it
might
be
the
basis
for
the
imposition
of
penalties
even
if,
in
the
future,
the
discharges
are
allowed
without
a
permit
under
the
new
amendment.
so
in
this
case,
the
court
now
turns
to
the
preamendment
version
of
the
industrial
stormwater
rule
and
the
court
finds
that
the
preamendment
rule
is
a
permissible
construction
by
the
epa
of
the
statutory
term
associated
with
industrial
activity.
as
such,
it
exempts
from
the
permitting
scheme,
discharges
of
channeled
stormwater
runoff
from
the
logging
roads.
when
an
agency
interprets
its
own
regulation,
the
court,
as
a
general
rule,
defers
to
it
unless
that
interpretation
is
plainly
erroneous
or
inconsistent
with
the
regulation.
this
principle
is
often
referred
to
as
the
auer,
as
auer
deference,
a-u-e-r,
after
the
court's
ruling
in
the
case
of
auer
versus
robbins.
here,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
epa
to
conclude
that
under
the
regulatory
scheme,
the
permit
requirement
extends
only
to
traditional
industrial
buildings
such
as
factories
and
other
relatively
fixed
facilities.
for
example,
a
sawmill
might
be
a
site
for
which
discharge
permits
are
required,
but
these
logging
roads
are
not.
the
epa
has
been
consistent
in
this
position.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
the
cases
are
remanded
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
in
which
justice
alito
joins.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
and
dissenting
in
part.
justice
breyer
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
