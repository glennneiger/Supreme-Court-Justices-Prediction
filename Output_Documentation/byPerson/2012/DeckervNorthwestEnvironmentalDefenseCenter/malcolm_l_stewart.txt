mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
friday,
the
epa
administrator
signed
a
new
rule
that
amends
epa's
existing
regulatory
definition
of
the
term
"stormwater
discharge
associated
with
industrial
activity.
"
the
new
rulemaking
specifically
disapproves
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
and
states
explicitly
that
the
only
facilities
under
sic
code
2411
that
are
industrial
are
rock
crushing,
gravel
washing,
log
sorting
and
log
storing.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
we
were
not.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
learned
on
friday
morning
that
the
final
rule
would
be
issued.
i
learned
on
friday
afternoon
that
the
final
rule
had
been
issued.
within
five
minutes
of
that
time,
i
alerted
counsel
for
both
the
petitioners
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
knew
that
it
was
a
strong
possibility
--
i
knew
that
it
was
a
strong
possibility
that
it
would
come
out.
the
epa
had
issued
a
notice
in
september
of
proposed
rulemaking.
there
was
a
notation
on
omb's
website
in
early
november
to
the
effect
that
the
rule
had
been
transmitted
for
final
approval
by
omb.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
in
early
november.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
we
--
you
know,
we
did
explain
in
the
opening
brief
that
the
rule
had
been--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
i
think
that
--
well,
i
think
this
happened
more
quickly
than
it
usually
does,
but
i
think
we
intended
respect
for
the
court's
processes
rather
than
disrespect.
obviously,
it's
suboptimal
for
the
new
rule
to
be
issued
the
friday
before
oral
argument;
but,
it
would
have
been
even
worse,
i
think,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
parties'
and
the
court's
decision-making
processes
if
the
rule
had
been
issued
a
week
or
two
after
the
court
heard
oral
argument.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
with
respect
to
the
impact
of
the
rule
on
this
case,
the
new
rule
was
not
intended
to
change
the
meaning
of
the
preexisting
definition,
and
in
our
view
it
renders
the
case
moot.
and,
really,
the
point
of
issuing
the
new--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
question
of
attorney's
fees,
if
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
was
vacated
on
the
ground
that
the
case
would
become
moot,
attorney
fee's
are
available
under
the
clean
water
act
and
citizen
suits
only
to
prevailing
or
substantially
prevailing
parties.
and
i
don't
see
any
way
that
respondent
could
make
a
claim
to
be
a
prevailing
or
substantially
prevailing
party
when,
at
the
end
of
the
day,
it
got
no
relief.
now,
with
respect
to
questions
of
remediation,
and
particularly
of
civil
penalties,
the
court,
in
steel
company
and
laidlaw,
addressed
the
circumstances
under
which
civil
penalties
would
--
could
and
could
not
be
awarded
in
citizen
suits.
and
the
court
in
steel
company
said
that
in
citizen
suits,
a
citizen
plaintiff
lacks
standing
to
seek
civil
penalties
as
a
remedy
for
past
violations
because
the
citizen
derives
no
benefit
from
payment
of
the
penalties
into
the
treasury.
in
laidlaw,
the
court
held
that
where
there
is
a
prospect
of
recurring
violations
or
ongoing
violations,
the
citizen
plaintiff
does
have
standing
to
seek
civil
penalties
as
a
deterrent
to
future
illegality.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
that
even
if
--
if,
by
the
time
the
suit
was
wound
up,
there
was
no
prospect
of
an
ongoing
or
future
violation
because
epa
had
amended
the
rule
to
make
clear
that
the
conduct
was
lawful,
there
would
be
no
future
illegality
to
deter.
and
then
there--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
and
if
we
actually
had
a
civil
penalty
award
issued
by
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance,
it
might
be
a
complicated
question
whether
that
award
should
be
vacated.
but
the
district
court
ruled
in
the
petitioner's
favor.
there
was
never
any
civil
penalty
award.
and
so
if
--
if
the
question
is
can
the
district
court
at
some
future
stage
of
this
case
enter
a
civil
penalty
award,
under
laidlaw
the
only
justification
for
that
in
a
citizen
suit
would
be
to
deter
illegal
conduct
that
might
be
thought
to
be
possible
after
the
civil
penalty
award
was
issued
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would
not
have
to
be
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
was
wrong
at
the
time
that
it
was
entered;
that
is,
even
if
epa
had
done
something
that
was
explicitly
characterized
as
a
change
in
the
law,
if
epa
had
issued
a
rule-making
that
said,
what
petitioners
had
been
doing
was
unlawful
up
to
this
point,
but
we've
decided
that
it
shouldn't
be
unlawful,
and,
therefore,
we're
amending
the
rule
to
make
it
legal,
if
epa
had
done
that
there
would
still
be
no
prospect
of
future
illegality,
assuming
that
the
rule
is
taken
to
be
valid.
and,
therefore,
although
in
an
epa
enforcement
action,
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
getting
monetary
awards
for
past
misconduct
because
that's
something
the
government
can
do,
the
citizen's
only
stake
in
the
matter
would
be
to
deter
future
illegalities.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
certainly
is
possible
that
the
rule
will
be
challenged,
but,
as
petitioners
have
emphasized
in
their
brief,
and
we
agree,
the
proper
forum
for
adjudicating
challenges
to
the
validity
of
an
epa
regulation
is
through
a
suit
brought
against
epa
based
on
the
administrative
record.
that
is,
a
citizen
suit
against
the
petitioners--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--you
don't
know.
but
i
think
at
this
point
the
prospect
that
the
epa
rule
would
be
both
challenged
and
vacated
is
sufficiently
speculative
that
it
would
be
out
of
keeping
with
general
principles
of
mootness
for
the
court
to
go
on
to
decide
the
question
of
what
the
old
rule
meant.
and,
really--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
we
would
want
to
study
that
a
little
further.
the
general
rule,
certainly,
is
that
injunctive
--
the
propriety
of
injunctive
relief
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
court's
decision.
and
under
the
newly
promulgated
rule,
once
the
rule
took
effect,
that
--
that
would
be
to
the
effect
that
the
discharges
from
stormwater
runoff
are
not
covered,
and
an
order
requiring
remediation
would
be
a
form
of
prospective
injunctive
relief.
it
would
address--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
either
one
would
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--our
preference
would
be
that
the
court
issue
an
order
vacating
as
moot;
but,
it
would
also
be
an
appropriate
decision
to
leave
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
instance.
and,
again,
epa's
objective
in
this
was
to
obviate
the
need
to
decide
vex
questions
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
old
rule.
that
is,
epa
has
said
for
nearly
40
years
that
it
doesn't
believe
that
npdes
permits
are
the
appropriate
way
of
addressing
the
dangers
to
water
quality
that
are
posed
by
these
sorts
of
discharges
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
one
piece
that
we
would
want
to
take
a
closer
look
at
is
the
specific
question
of
remediation
for
past
harm,
that
is,
concrete
steps
on
the
ground
to
undo
the
results
of
past
discharges.
the
other
two
pieces
of
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
correct,
that,
as
i
say,
we
haven't
--
we
haven't
specifically
focused
on
this
question;
but,
my
instinct
is
that
an
order
of
remediation
would
be
an
aspect
of
prospective
injunctive
relief
that
would
be
governed
by
the
general
rule
that
injunctive
relief
is
to
be
determined
under
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
court's
decisions.
but
with
respect
to
the
other
two
elements
of
relief,
i
think
those
can
be
easily
dealt
with
as
a
matter
of
law;
that
is,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
seeking
an
injunction
ordering
that
no
further
discharges
occur
without
a
permit,
then
clearly
the
propriety
of
that
sort
of
injunction
would
be
determined
under
the
new
rule,
and
it
wouldn't
be
available.
and
i
think
laidlaw
is
clear
that
the
only
basis
that
a
citizen
has
for
seeking
civil
penalties
is
to
deter
future
violations,
not
to
punish
prior
violations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
because,
here,
the
basis
for
mootness
is
not
that
the
defendants
in
the
suit
have
promised
to
change
their
ways;
it
is
that
the
epa
has
issued
a
new
regulation
to
make
clear--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
epa
is
--
epa
is
not
the
defendant
in
the
case;
so,
even
if
this
were
viewed
as
a
change
in
ways,
it
wouldn't
be
voluntary
cessation.
