justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
ruling
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
on
the
statute
--
whether
the
statute
mandates
that
these
logging
roads
be
governed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
so
that's
not
a
point
that
this
court
could
resolve
in
the
first
instance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
you
can
do
that;
but,
this
court
is
a
court
of
review,
not
first
view,
and
we
don't
take
questions
that
haven't
been
aired
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
wouldn't
have
to
do
anything
if
the
court
vacated
the
decision
below.
then
you
wouldn't
be
facing
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
be--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
you
be
entitled
to
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
so
if
you're
right
that
you're
entitled
to
it
and
we
agree
with
you,
then
there
is
nothing.
you
don't
have
anything
hanging
over
your
head
as
a
result--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--of
the
prior
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
--
that
is
the
question,
the
question
of
what
the
statute
requires,
was
not
decided
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you're
not
urging
that
we
reach
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
were
challenging
the
new
rule,
you
would
have
epa
as
your
adversary.
the
format
of
this
case
now
is
we
have
--
we
have
decker
on
one
side
and
you
on
the
other
and
the
epa
is
not
in
the
lawsuit.
