mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
a
straightforward
ground
for
reversal
here
that
rests
on
a
standard
application
of
deference
principles
to
epa's
treatment
of
stormwater.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
thank
you.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
thank
you.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
thank
you.
the
problem
with
that
rule
is
that
it
puts
into
place
something
that
epa
has
been
telling
the
courts
throughout
this
litigation,
that
in
the
stormwater
rule
where
epa
refers
to
standard
industrial
classification
2411,
that
what
it
is
referring
to
is
solely
the
four
identified
point
sources
in
the
silvicultural
--
rock
crushing
and
so
on.
in
this
case,
nedc
respondent
argues
that
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute
which
is
that
discharges
that
are
associated
with
industrial
activity
must
have
npdes
permits,
prevents
epa
from
doing
that--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--no.
it
did
not.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
that
is
an
argument
that
respondents
have
made
in
this
court.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
i
don't
think
that's
--
i
don't
think
that's
right.
the
--
the
respondent
can
defend
its
judgment
on
grounds
other
than
those
that
were
--
that
were
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
there
is
an
additional
reason
why
we
don't
think
that
the
rule
here
moots
--
moots
the
issue.
let
--
let's
assume
that
there
is
a
petition
for
review.
i
think
that's
a
fairly
safe
--
safe
assumption.
that
some
environmental
groups
argue
that
the
new
rule
is
impermissible
because
it's
at
odds
with
the
language
of
the
--
language
of
the
statute,
an
argument
that
i
think
is
--
is
near
frivolous,
but
that
i
think
will
be
--
predictably
will
be
made.
the
rule
is
prospective.
what
we
have
is
a
judgment
from
the
ninth
circuit
that
says
that
we
were
in
violation
for
decades
by
not
having
permits.
and--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
let
me
argue
--
let
me
--
maybe--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
i
wish
it
were
so
clear.
certainly,
we
think
that
that
is
the
case.
what
they've
asked
for
below
is
penalties,
attorney's
fees
and
remediation
of
environmental
harm.
now
--
now,
we
think
that
under
laidlaw
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
get
any
of
those
three
things.
now,
this
only
happened
on
friday,
so
i
can't
claim
that
i've
done
complete
research
on
--
on
the
point.
but
it
--
you
know,
i
do
think
that
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
any
law
on
the
application
of
laidlaw
to
a
claim
for
remediation.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
it's
an
amendment
of
the
existing
rule.
but
what
it
does
is
to
put
into
place
against
the
rule
exactly
what
epa
has
been
saying
throughout
this
litigation.
there
is
nothing
new
in
the
rule.
so
this
is
something
that
epa
has
been
saying
in
the
litigation
and
that
we
think
is
entitled
to
auer
deference
as
a
result
of
that.
now,
it's
in
the
rule
so
it
gets
--
it
gets
chevron
deference.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
we
are
--
we
are
hoping
that
you
rule
--
you'll
rule
with
us.
and
certainly
on
the
basis
of
this
rule--
[laughter]
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
on
the
basis
of
this
rule,
you
have
to
understand
that
the
challenge
to
this
rule
is
the
claim
that
the
--
the
words
“
associated
with
industrial
activity
”
must
be
interpreted
by
epa
to
include
harvesting
activities
and
the
--
the
moving
of
the
logs
out
of
the
harvest
area.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
yes.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
right.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
and
this
court
can
cut
through
all
of
that
by
deciding
this
case,
which
the
simplest
way
to
decide
this
case
is
under
the
stormwater
rule.
if
the
court
decides
this
case
in
our
favor
under
the
stormwater
rule,
then
that
will
preclude
a
large
part
of
the
basis
for
the
challenge
to
the
new
rule.
it's
squarely
in
front
of
this
court.
mr.
fisher
has
made
the
argument
here.
the
stormwater
rule
is
squarely
here.
congress
completely
revamped
the
clean
water
act's
approach
to
stormwater
in
1987
and
it
made
clear
that
as
a
default
point-source
stormwater
is
regulated
by
the
state,
with
npdes
permits
required
only
for
discharges
that
are
associated
with
industrial
activity
and
a
few
other
categories.
and
those
statutory
terms
“
industrial
activity
”
and
“
associated
with
”
are
both
ambiguous.
and
with
those
words,
congress
left
epa
with
discretion
to
determine
what
activities
count
as
industrial.
and
it's
in
keeping
with
dictionary
definitions
for
epa
to
have
categorized
activities
like
law,
banking,
retail,
agriculture,
and
silviculture
as
not
industrial.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
i
think
there
is
briefing
on
it.
i
mean,
both
parties
have
briefed
it.
it
gets
2
pages
because
it's
a
--
a
near-frivolous
argument
under
the
--
under
the
caselaw,
i
think.
but,
the
fact
is,
if
you
don't--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--now,
the
issue
is
before
this
court.
if
the
court
doesn't
decide
the
issue,
then
we
go
back,
we
have
to
fight
for
years
about
remedies,
about
the
appropriateness
of
remedies
for
this
adjudicated
past
violation
under
laidlaw.
laidlaw
has
some
very
complex
law
that's
developed
under
it.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
obviously,
if
the
court
held
the
case
was
moot,
then
we'd
like
the
--
the
vacatur.
but
in
the--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--but
if
there's
going
to
be
a
challenge
to
the
new
rule--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--yes,
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
vacatur.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
what's
left
of--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--what's
left
at
that
point
is
another
5
or
6
years
of
litigation
under
the
new
rule
on
an
issue
that
is
briefed
in
this
court,
before
this
court,
and
i
think
relatively
easy
to
decide
under
the
stormwater
rule.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
the
industrial
activities
issue.
i
mean,
the
--
the
rest
of
this
case
has
become
very
complex,
i
think,
because
of
--
of
the,
you
know,
the
government
has
raised
the
seminole
rock
argument
that
--
that
no
one's
ever
heard
of
before.
mr.
fisher
has
introduced
an
argument
about
whether
the
1375(b)
categories
--
the
case
falls
within
those
categories.
but
there
is
a
simple
way
to
decide
this
case
and
that
is
under
the
stormwater
rule
epa
had
the
discretion
to
determine
what
activities
are
industrial
and
it
determined
that
timber
harvesting
is
not
industrial.
it
defined
“
immediate
access
roads
”
in
a
way
that
does
not
cover
these
--
these
roads
even
if
it
were
industrial.
and
these
are
terms
--
the
term
“
industrial
”
is
one
that
is
ambiguous.
the
term
“
associated
with
industrial
activity
”
is
one
that
admits
of
degree.
it's
like
the
word
“
minimized
”--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the
public--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--the
public
--
no.
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
issue
because
the
epa
has
decided
that
the
timber
harvesting
activity
is
not
industrial.
in
the
rule
--
implementing
this
rule
with
a
--
a
multisectored
general
permit
for
industrial
activity,
epa
said,
quote:
"harvesting
activities,
including
loading
and
initial
transport
from
an
active
harvest
site,
are
not
required
to
be
covered
under
the
stormwater
permits.
"
you
know,
it's
been
perfectly
clear
in
--
when
it
promulgated
the
rule,
it
said
that
the
reference
to
sic
24
was
a
reference
to
sawmills,
planing
mills,
and
other
mills.
when,
in
the
briefs
in
this
case,
it
--
it
explained
the
reference
to
sic
2411,
it
said:
"by
not
excluding
sic
2411,
epa
intended
to
reference
only
the
four
categories
of
silvicultural
activities
already
defined
as
point
sources.
"
so
it's
--
epa
has
been--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--absolutely
clear
that
timber
harvesting
is
not
industrial
activity--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--and,
therefore,
it
does
not
get
to
the
“
associated
”.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
you
can--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
remember
that
the
stormwater
rule
applies
to
point
sources.
the
default
position
under
the
stormwater
rule
is
that
point
sources
do
not
require
npdes
permits.
and
then
congress
said
there
are
certain
categories
that
do,
and
one
of
those
is
discharges
that
are
associated
with
industrial
activity.
epa
has
said
that
under
these
terms,
“
associated
with
industrial
activity
”,
“
in
industrial
activity
”,
neither
the
timber
harvest
nor
the
roads:
"the
initial
loading
and
initial
transport
from
an
active
harvest
site
are
not
required
to
be
covered
by
stormwater
permits.
"
it
says
in
the
rule
that
immediate
access
roads
are
the
only
things
that
are
covered.
it
explains
in
the
preamble
to
the
1976
rule
that
that
means
on-plant
roads
that
are
dedicated
for
use
by
an
industrial
facility,
not
public
roads.
these
are
public
roads.
these
are
used
by
hunters,
fishermen,
off-road
vehicle
enthusiasts,
bird
watchers.
these
are
fairly
heavily
trafficked
public
roads
that
are
used
for
a
few
weeks
every
few
decades
for
logging
activities.
and
so
these
are
not,
epa
has
been
very
clear,
the
sort
of--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--yes,
some
--
some
of
them
surely
--
surely
were.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
but
--
but
they
are
public
roads.
they
are
owned
by
the
counties
or
they're
owned
by
the
state.
these
two
particular
roads
that
we
are
talking
about
here
have
been
there
between
50
and
75
years.
they
run
by
the
river.
there
is
a
school
bus
pull-off
on
one
of
them
because
there
are
houses
by
the
side
of
this
road.
there
--
these
are
--
these
are
quintessential
public
roads
that
are
used
by
loggers
from
time
to
time.
are
they
--
are
they
built
there?
are
there
other
roads
that
are
built
by
us?
yes.
but
they
are
public
roads
maintained
by
us
under
contracts
with
the
state
only
during
the
period
when
we
are
using
them
for
--
for
logging
activity,
and
otherwise
maintained
by
the
--
by
the
state.
so
the
--
and
we
think,
to
come
back
to
your
--
your
initial
question,
chief
justice,
about
whether
this
can
be
decided
without
getting
into
these
other
complex
issues
--
that
you
don't
have
to
--
if
you
decide
this
case
under
the
stormwater
rule,
it's
--
and
taking
at
face
value
what
the
ninth
circuit
said,
which
is
the
rule
itself
is
not
clear,
we
see
the
ninth
circuit
set
a
reference
here
to
sic
2411,
which
is
logging.
we
see
this
reference
to
immediate
access
roads.
so
at
--
at
that
point,
we
--
you
look
at
what
epa
has
said.
and
epa's
explanation
in
its
1976
preamble,
in
its
briefs
and
in
--
in
this
case,
are
--
are
absolutely
clear
that
there
was
no
intention
on
epa's
part
to
cover
the
channelled
runoff
alongside
these
roads.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
well,
if
there
is
--
if
there
is
a
vacatur,
so
that
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
remedies
below--
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
--well,
the
remedies
--
we
are
obviously
not
worried
about
injunctive
relief.
we
are
worried
about
the
relief
that
they
have
asked
for,
for
past
--
supposed
past
violations,
which
is
penalties,
attorney's
fees,
and
i
think
the
more
complex
one
under
the
case
law
is
remediation
for
environmental
harm,
which
the
case
law
just
doesn't
seem
to
address
under
--
under
laidlaw.
so
we
are
worried
about
those.
and
principally,
what
we
would
like
to
do
is
to
get
sorted
out
once
and
for
all
here
an
argument
that
otherwise
would
drag
through
the
courts
for
the
next
five
or
six
years
under
this
rule,
putting
the
whole
industry
into
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
that
we
think
is
unwarranted.
if
i
can
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
timothy
s.
bishop
thank
you.
we
are
not
asking
you
to
adjudicate
the
new
rule.
i'm
not
sure
why
we
are
hearing
all
of
this
about
the
details
of
the
new
rule.
what
we
are
asking
you
to
do
is
to
get
rid
of
this
case.
in
getting
rid
of
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
stormwater
rule,
it
will
eliminate
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
plaintiffs
will
make
in
a
--
in
a
challenge
to
the
new
rule.
it
will
simplify
that
challenge.
what
it
will
do
is
to
get
rid
of
this
case
and
get
rid
of
a
ninth
circuit
opinion
that
really
put
the
court
in
a
--
the
position
of
overriding
what
epa
has
been
saying
consistently
since
1976,
consistent
position
that
collected
forest
road
runoff
is
not
point
source,
and
since
1980
that
logging
is
not
industrial
activity
and
these
roads
are
not
associated
with
industrial
activity.
and
for
my
clients,
that
is
--
has
a
great
deal
of
values,
particularly
since,
as
mr.
fisher
has
admitted,
what
he
really
wants
here
is
to
be
back
in
the
ninth
circuit
seeking
not
only,
apparently,
relief,
backward-looking
relief,
but
also
prospective
relief.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
submit.
