chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-338,
decker
v.
northwest
environmental
defense
center
and
georgia-pacific
v.
the
northwest
environmental
defense
center.
mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
before
--
before
we
get
into
that,
congratulations
to
your
clients--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--getting
almost
all
the
relief
they're
looking
for
under
the
new
rule
issued
on
friday.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
thank
you
for
calling
it
to
our
attention.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
--
it's
an
unusual
situation
for
us
to
rule
in
a
case
where
the
issue
has
ongoing
significance
and
that's
taken
away.
and
what
we
would
be
doing
is,
when
there
is
a
new
rule,
we
would
be
considering
quite
a
lot
of
difficult
issues
to
determine
what
the
old
rule
was,
so
that
you
can
unravel
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
upheld.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
a
--
is
this
a
new
rule
that
they
--
i
too
haven't
had
much
of
a
chance
to
look
at
it,
but
is
this
a
new
rule,
or
is
it
an
amendment
of
the
existing
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
you
sure
you
want
what
you're
asking
for?
what
if
we
go
ahead
and
decide
this
case
and
rule
against
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
now,
i
suppose
that
your
clients
and
others
similarly
situated,
or
i
--
i
guess
it
would
be
the
respondents,
can
challenge
the
new
rule,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
would
have
simultaneously
pending
a
case
involving
the
interpretation
of
the
old
rule
and
a
challenge
to
the
new
rule.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
each
of
which
would
have
the
same
issue.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
issue
are
you
talking
about?
the
industrial
activities
issue
or
the
silvicultural?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
were
you
as
surprised
as
we
were
to
learn
about
that
final
rule?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
did
you
learn
that
the
final
rule
would
be
issued
on
friday?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
had
no
idea
before
friday
that
this
was
coming
out?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
early
november?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
maybe
in
the
future
you
could
let
us
know
when
something
as
definite
as
that
comes.
there
were
875
pages
on
the
merits
briefing
in
this
case,
and
if
we
knew
that
the
final
rule
was
imminent,
we
could
have
rescheduled
the
case
for
april
or
something
along
those
lines.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
i
know,
that
there
was
a
proposed
rule.
is
it
your
experience
that
proposed
epa
rules
become
final
within
a
couple
of
months
particularly?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
maybe.
and
it
would
have
been
best
if
we
had
known
about
this
in
early
november.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
--
are
you
saying
that
the
private
companies
would
not
be
liable
for
civil
penalties,
even
though
the
alleged
violation
was
ongoing
at
the
time
of
the
district
court
litigation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
can
i
stop
you
just
for
a
moment?
epa
made
clear
that
the
conduct
was
not
unlawful.
we
have
a
new
regulation.
the
fact
that
they
have
issued
a
new
regulation
doesn't
mean
that
the
reading
--
doesn't
mean
that
that's
a
demonstration
that
the
prior
conduct
under
the
old
regulation
was
lawful.
now,
i
know
you've
taken
the
position
that
it
was
not,
but
you've
got
a
court
of
appeals
decision
saying
it
was.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
would
have
to
be
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
was
wrong.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
--
i'm
having
trouble
seeing
how
we
can
dismiss
it
as
moot
when
there
would
remain
pending
claims
for
civil
penalties
and
injunctive
relief,
which
you've
already
said
you
want
to
take
a
closer
look
at,
and
attorney's
fees.
now,
you
seem
fairly
confident
that
they'll
lose
on
those,
but
you
felt
pretty
confident
that
you'd
win
on
this.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
something
that,
in
terms
of
mootness,
we
should
evaluate
under
the
voluntary
cessation
doctrine?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
epa
has
changed
its
ways.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
we
do
that,
if
we
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted,
you
still
go
back
and
you
--
you
get
your
attorney's
fees,
you
get
the
civil
penalties,
you
get
remediation
because
the
law
governing
your
case
would
be
the
existing
ninth
circuit
opinion.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
case
is
not--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
was
just
going
to
say
the
case
is
not
going
to
be
over
if
we
dismiss.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because,
as
you
just
said,
it's
interlocutory.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
--
i
thought
--
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
they
said
that
their
rules
mooted
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
we
--
if
we
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
ninth
circuit
would
then
be
the
--
be
a
court
to
consider
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
just
thinking
if
we
vacate,
perhaps
another
court
will
consider
it,
but
if
we
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted
the
ninth
circuit
will,
quite
reasonably,
think
they
are
done.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
they're
done
--
they
are
done
in
terms
of
their
interpretation
of
the
regulation
and
the
applicable
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
point
--
the
ninth
circuit
had
the,
of
course,
epa's
views
before
it.
i
don't
know,
if
i'm
the
ninth
circuit,
why
i
would
reconsider
my
ruling
in
light
of
this
new
regulation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
mean
the
ruling
in
the
decision
that
they--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--issued
that's
before
us
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bishop,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
