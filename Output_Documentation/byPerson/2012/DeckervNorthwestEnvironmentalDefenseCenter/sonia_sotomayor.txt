i
thought
the
case
law
was
fairly
clear
that
when
the
epa
changes
its
rules
in
your
favor,
that
they
can't
--
the
court
can't
impose
penalties
for
a
past
violation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
we
--
how
do
we
avoid,
under
your
reading
--
assuming
we
agreed
with
you
with
what
the
rule
says,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
logging
roads
and
access
roads.
the
other
side
raises
a
lot
of
question
about
whether
these,
in
fact,
are
access
roads
or
not.
so
do
--
do
we
need
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--do
we
have
to
reach
that
issue
then?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
we--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
may
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--it
may
not
be,
but
these
are
pipes,
ditches,
and
channels
which
the
cwa
explicitly
defines
as
point
sources--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
are
not
part
of
the
harvesting.
by
definition,
they
are
not.
they're
--
you're
saying
public
roads
and
not
access
roads.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
deal
with
his
points
about
the
ex-fact
remedies
of
attorney's
fees
and
remediation.
why
are
--
why
are
those
moot?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
this
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
you're
disclaiming
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals;
you
think
you
can
bring
a
citizen
suit
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
regulation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
the
whole
point,
which
is
if
you
go
back
what's
the
value
of
the
backward-looking
construction
if
what
you're
seeking
is
injunctive
relief
that
has
to
be
based
on
the
new
rule.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
that
include
a
right
to
intervene
and
dismiss
the
action?
