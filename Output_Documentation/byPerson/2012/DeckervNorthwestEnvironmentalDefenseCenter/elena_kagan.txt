but,
mr.
bishop,
as
--
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
that
question
was
not
decided
below,
and
in
the
context
of
this
case,
which,
of
course,
was
very
different
when
it
was
briefed,
mr.
fisher
spent
a
grand
total
of
2
pages,
and
rightly
so.
it
wasn't
--
it
was
--
it
was
not
the
main
issue
in
the
case
then.
so
would
we
really
be
doing
something,
you
know,
a
good
practice
to
decide
this
issue
without
really
any
briefing
on
it
and
without
a
decision
below?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
isn't
really
quite
fair.
it
is
2
pages
because
it
wasn't
decided
below
and
because
--
and
because
the
--
the
question
the
--
in
the
case
was
very
different,
with
a
different
regulation.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bishop,
could
i
--
i'm
sorry
that
i
don't
understand
this
well
enough
yet,
but
can
i
understand
what's
still
at
stake
for
you
in
--
in
the
case?
put
aside
the
question
of
whether
the
new
rule
is
valid
or
not,
all
right?
and
what
--
what
do
you
have
riding
on
whether
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
correct
at
this
point?
justice
elena
kagan
which
remedies
are
you
worried
about?
justice
elena
kagan
is
what
you
said
true
also
of
the
remediation
piece
of
this?
you
said
that
at
this
point
even
if
we
understand
this
as
a
change
in
the
law,
the
plaintiffs
would
not
be
entitled
to
fines.
would
they
also
not
be
entitled
to
any
kind
of
remediation?
justice
elena
kagan
it
seems
strange
that
you
would
--
there
would
be
an
order
of
remediation
to
undo
the
results
of
past
discharges
when
at
this
point
the
law
going
forward
is,
go
ahead
and
discharge.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fisher,
why
would
you
proceed
that
way?
it's
at
least
arguable
that
you're
wrong
on
that.
i
mean,
it's
a
--
it's
a
question
as
to
what
1369
does.
and
you
obviously
do
have
the
route
of
direct
review.
why
don't
you
proceed
that
way
with
respect
to
the
new
regulation?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
that,
on
your
view
of
1369,
you
can't
go
to
the
ninth
circuit?
