that's
usually
the
objective.
justice

what
if
--
what
if
the
rule
is
held
invalid?
i
mean,
we
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
until
this
rule
is
challenged
and
there
is
ultimately
a
--
i'm
sure
it
will
be
challenged
because
their
position
is
that
the
--
this
rule
contradicts
the
statute.
so
how
does
that
factor
in
to
your
analysis?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
my
point
is
until
that
suit
is
concluded,
you
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
possibility
of
future
violation
or
not,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
active,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
--
they
cut
maybe,
what,
every
--
every
10
years?
is
that
active?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
9
years
in
between?
are
they
being
actively
used?
justice

i'm
looking
at
page
7
and
it
doesn't
say
the
authority
to
designate
additional
roads.
it
says
additional
stormwater
discharges.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
could
be
stormwater
discharges
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
logging.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
they
are
just
intervening.
it's
not
like
what
happens
in
the
--
in
the
suits
for
fraud
against
the
government
where
they
take
over
the
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
take
it
over.
they
just
intervene.
