mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me,
in
light
of
the
recent
events,
that
the
most
appropriate
course
for
this
court
is
to
just
simply
dismiss
this
case
as
improvidently
granted.
if
this
court
had
reached
its
--
had
gotten
a
cert
petition
under
the
circumstances
present
right
now,
it
seems
to
me
there'd
be
three
very
strong
reasons
simply
just
to
deny
the
petition.
first
of
all,
because
epa,
in
its
rulemaking
on
friday
afternoon,
itself
says
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
has
--
cancels
out
any
impact
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
on
the
ground
moving
forward.
second
of
all,
the
case
is
interlocutory
in
posture.
remember,
we
are
just
on
a
reversal
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
so
every
argument
that's
left
in
the
case,
in
addition
to
whatever
mootness
arguments
anyone
wants
to
make,
which
i'll
explain
why
in
a
moment
we
would
disagree
with,
can
all
be
made
on
remand
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
if
people
are
unhappy
--
or
not
on
remand,
but
just
simply
when
the
case
returns
--
if
people
are
unhappy
with
those
results,
they
can
bring
the
case
back
up
to
this
court.
and--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
if
that's
where
the
case
ends
up
when
it's
over
and
they
bring
it
back
and
you
deny
cert.--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
there's
a
much--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
that's
my
point,
yes.
and
--
but
i
want
to
make
one
thing
very
clear.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
the
law
of
the
case
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--all
the
district
court
must
do
under
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
consider
this
to
be
a
point
source,
for
the
reason
that
justice
sotomayor
mentioned,
and
that
--
the
other
side
has
virtually
walked
away
from
that
argument,
anyway.
it
is
pipe,
ditch
or
channel;
it's
perfectly
obvious
we're
dealing
with
point
sources
here.
the
only
question
is
whether
have
you
this
covered
by
the
stormwater
rules,
to
the
extent
they
are
valid.
and
that,
the
district
court
or
the
ninth
circuit
or
whoever
would
consider
in
the
first
instance,
and
that
could
come
back
to
this
court.
but
if
i
might
just
explain
to
this
court,
i
think
it
will
help
the
conversation
if
i
explain
exactly
what
our
case
looks
like
going
forward,
because
we
have
and
will
maintain
a
claim
for
forward-looking
relief
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
for
the
reason
that
was
mentioned
a
couple
of
times
in
the
beginning
part
of
the
argument,
because
we
contend
that
the
new
rule
simply
violates
the
statute,
and
we
have
a
right
to
bring
a
citizen
suit
for
a
violation
of
the
clean
water
act
itself,
which
is
to
say
the
language
that
requires
epa
to
regulate--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--all
discharges
associated
with
industrial
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
wouldn't
put
it
exactly
that
way,
justice
sotomayor.
what
i
would
say
is
that
we
that
have
the
power
to
bring
--
or
we
have
the
right
to
bring
a
citizen
suit
to
enforce
the
act.
and
if
there
is
a
regulation
that
the
other
side
brings
up
that
says
we
are
--
supposedly
says
we
are
exempt
from
having
to
get
permits,
our
position
is
that
regulation
just
simply
doesn't
fall
under
1369(b)(1),
for
the
reasons
judge
pryor
just
found
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
i
sent
that
up
as
supplemental
authority.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
is,
a--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
ninth
circuit
had
no
--
no
reason
to
reach
it
because
the
regulations
on
stormwater
as
then
written
were
absolutely
clear
that
logging
activities--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
the
most
prudent
thing,
as
i've
said,
is
for
this
court
not
to
reach
that,
and
to
let
--
as
you
described,
to
let
a
lower
court
look
at
it
first,
and
to
bring
it
back.
but
if
i
can
finish
my
question
--
or
my
answer
to
justice
sotomayor,
the
reason
why
that
regulation
doesn't
require
us
to
go
to
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
instance
and
actually
lets
us
proceed
on
a
citizen
suit
is
because
the
only
two
subsections
of
1369(b)(1)
that
they
have
mentioned
are
subsections
(e)
and
(f).
subsection
(f)
deals
with
epa
decisions,
quote,
“
issuing
or
denying
a
permit
”.
well,
this
decision
does
neither
of
those
things.
secondly,
it
covers
epa
actions
that
set
effluent
levels
or
effluent
limitations.
and,
again,
for
the
reasons
the
eleventh
circuit
just
held
and
other
courts
have
held,
this
doesn't
do
that
either.
so
there
is
nothing
in
1369(b)(1)
that
stands
in
our
way
of
bringing
a
citizen
suit
to
enforce
the
statute
on
those
terms.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
that
what
we'll
do
is
proceed
whatever
way
we
can.
because
our
--
you
know,
either
--
either
we
are
supposed
to
go
directly
to
the
ninth
circuit
--
or
any
court
of
appeals,
or
we
are
not.
and
if
we
are,
then
we
will;
and
if
we're
not
supposed
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
as
we
believe
a
fair
reading
of
the
law
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
plain
text
meaning
of
the
law
that
could
go
otherwise
--
then
we
have
--
the
only
way
we
can
do
this
is
through
a
citizen
suit.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
exactly.
and
that's
what
the
eleventh
circuit
just
held
in
a
case
just
like
this,
where
there
was
a
regulation
at
issue
that
exempted
certain
discharges
from
the
permitting
program.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
case
dismissed.
you
can't
bring
this
directly
to
us.
so
we
have
an
ongoing
claim
for
a
violation
of
the
statute,
which
i
can't
imagine
this
court
would
want
to
address
in
the
first
instance.
we
also,
it's
important
to
understand,
have
a
second
claim.
and
before
i
describe
that
second
claim,
let
me
describe
overall
--
just
remind
the
court
what
exactly
the
case
is
about.
the
case
isn't
about,
as
the
other
side
has
portrayed
many
times,
all
logging
roads,
all
logging
roads
that
may
exist
in
the
world
--
or
the
united
states.
what
the
case
is
about
are
two
very
specific
kinds
of
logging
roads:
one,
logging
roads
that
drain
themselves
by
way
of
pipes,
ditches
and
channels,
only
the
small
subset
of
logging
roads
that
do
that;
and,
second
of
all,
only
logging
roads
used
--
being
used
for
active
timber
harvesting
and
hauling.
not
roads
that
just
happen
to
be
sitting
in
the
forest
not
being
used,
but
only
the
small
subset
of
logging
roads
being
used
for
active
timber
cutting
and
harvesting.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
means
under--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well
--
well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
justice
scalia.
and
so
under
this
--
the
facts
of
this
case,
remember,
we're
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
so
when
mr.
bishop
says
1
or
2
weeks
out
of
whatever,
we
would
like
to
have
a
record
on
that
because
we
don't
think
that's
reality.
but
what
the
case
--
what
we
say
in
our
complaint
is
that
they
have
a
contract
with
the
state
of
oregon
to
harvest
particular
areas
and
use
particular
roads
to
access
that
timber
and
to
take
it
out.
and
the
--
and
the
contract
actually
requires
them
to
use
those
roads
and
to
maintain
their
drainage
systems.
and
so
our
claim
--
again,
just
to
remind
you
what
our
claim
is
under
the
statute
--
is
that
that
harvesting
activity
can't
be
thought
of
in
any
other
way
than
industrial
in
nature,
and
that
these
roads
are
associated
with
that
activity.
they
are
designed
for
that
purpose,
and
they're
indispensable
to
the
activity.
now,
we
have
a
second
argument.
even
if
the
court
thought
that
we
couldn't
win
--
or
a
--
whatever
court
looks
at
this,
thought
we
couldn't
win
on
the
statute,
we
have
a
chevron
step
ii
argument
that
we
will
make,
and
have
every
right
to
make,
because
if
--
i'll
beg
this
court's
indulgence
--
if
--
this
rule
that
they
have
just
announced
on
friday
afternoon
is
not
as
clear
as
you
might
think.
so
if
you
start
with
the
language
of
the
rule,
which
is
on
page
18,
what
they
have
done
is
they
have
amended
--
they
have
amended
the
stormwater
rules
to
--
to
provide
that
the
only
industrial
activities
associated
with
logging
are
sawmills,
which
are
covered
elsewhere,
and
then
these
four
categories
of
things:
rock
crushing,
gravel
washing,
log
sorting,
and
log
storage.
all--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it's
page
18,
the
last
page
of
--
at
least,
i'm
--
i
hope
your
copy
is
the
same
as
mine,
but
on
the
pdf
that
--
that
was
sent
up
to
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
and
if
you
go
all
the
way
to
the
bottom,
sub
2,
“
facilities
classified
under
sit
24
”.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
and
they
list
those
four
things.
and
--
and
then
industry
group
242
is
the
sawmills.
so
they
are
saying
those
are
the
only
industrial
activities
that
are
associated
with
logging.
but
that
doesn't
answer
our
claim.
our
claim
isn't
that
logging
roads
themselves
are
industrial
activities.
our
claim
is
that
logging
roads
are
associated
with
industrial
activities.
and
so
we
still
have
a
claim
that,
under
that
--
even
if
those
are
the
only
four
industrial
activities
--
or,
sorry,
five,
those
four
things
plus
sawmills
--
we
still
have
a
claim
that
logging
roads
are,
quote,
“
immediate
access
roads
”
to
those
activities.
and
the
definition
of
“
immediate
access
roads
”,
which
is
unchanged
by
the
new
regulation,
is
at
pet.
app.
40a
--
the
ninth
circuit
quoted
it,
and
i
think
it
was
described
earlier
by
my
friend
--
"roads
which
are
exclusively
or
primarily
dedicated
for
the
use
by
the
industrial
facility.
"
so
it's
still
a
mystery
to
us
how
logging
roads
are
not
primarily
for
use
by
even
sawmills
or
these
other
four
things.
and,
indeed,
if
you
look
very
carefully
at
epa's
new
regulation
in
the
preamble
on
page
6,
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
only
sentence
here
that
epa
gives
us
that
even
suggests
a
possible
response
to
the
argument
i
just
described
is
the
one
that
begins
with
the
word
“
unlike
”.
they
say:
"unlike
immediate
access
roads
associated
with
industrial
activities,
many
logging
roads
--
many
logging
roads
have
multiple
uses,
including
recreation
and
general
transportation,
and
commonly
extend
over
long
distance,
i.e.,
may
not
provide
immediate
access
to
an
industrial
site.
"
so
epa
is
leaving
open
our
argument.
epa
is
saying:
well,
logging
roads
that
are
just
generally
recreational,
et
cetera,
are
not
immediate
access
roads.
but
our
claim--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
that's
what
they
are
standing
here
today
saying.
but
i'm
telling
you
on
the
language
that
they
gave
us
on
friday
it
doesn't
moot
the
case.
and
i
can't
imagine
an
argument
being
made
on
monday
that
hasn't
been
prepared
in
any
written
form,
based
on
a
written
thing
that
we
got
on
friday,
that
we
have
an
argument
under
would
moot
our
case.
and
particularly,
mr.
chief
justice
--
and
this
is
my
point
about
going
through
all
this
--
i
can't
imagine
why
this
court
would
want
to
touch
all
this
in
the
first
instance,
particularly
without
supplemental
briefing,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
make
every
sense
to
let
the
ninth
circuit
address
our
arguments
first.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
because
we
have
a
forward
look
at
the
--
the
first
thing
we'll
tell
the
ninth
circuit
is--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
only
as
to
the
backward-looking
regulation,
but
now
we
have
--
our
complaint,
you
know,
as
a
citizen
suit
does--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
i
--
i
think
that
gets
you
very
close
to
the
same
place,
justice
kennedy.
i'm
just
saying
there
is
no
reason
to
vacate
because
the
ninth
circuit's
point-source
holding
is
so
self-evidently
right
that
i
don't
know
why
you'd
go
to
the
trouble
to
do
that.
it
makes
the
case
simpler
going
forward.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
do
you
mean
the
backward-looking
ruling?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
don't
know
that
they
would
reconsider
that--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
the
--
but
the
main
event
going
forward
is
the
new
rule,
because
the
citizen
suit
seeks
cessation
of
ongoing
violations
of
the
act,
and
that
remains
the
core
of
our
lawsuit
which
is
still
seeking
damages--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--it
doesn't
matter
very
much,
justice
sotomayor.
there
is
two
ways
in
which
it
might
matter
a
little
bit.
one
is
if
we
want
to
press
a
claim
for
any
kind
of
civil
penalties
or
remediation,
the
backward-looking
thing
would
matter.
we
have
to
decide
whether
we
would
want
to
do
that.
the
second
way
it
would
matter
would
be
it
would
provide
a
helpful
baseline
for
judging
the
new
rule
in
the
totality
of
epa
action,
which
brings
me
to
my
--
which
brings
me
back
to
the
argument
i
was
describing,
which
would
be
our
chevron
step
ii
argument,
that
epa
has
simply
either
left
this
argument
open
--
i
still
--
it
is
still
a
mystery
to
us
what
epa
thinks
about
our
real
argument,
which
is
that
active
hauling
logging
roads,
when
they
are
being
used
for
active
harvesting
and
hauling,
are
subject
to
the
act
because
they
are
plainly
associated
with
industrial
activity.
and
if
epa
later
on
came
out
and
said,
no,
no,
no,
we
mean
to
exclude
that,
too,
then,
we
respectfully
submit,
epa
would
still
have
a
lot
of
explaining
to
do.
first
of
all,
we
would
very
much
wonder
why
log
sorting,
log
storage,
gravel
washing
and
rock
crushing
are
industrial
activities,
but
mechanized
timber
harvesting
with
20-ton
pieces
of
machinery
is
not.
we'd
also
wonder
why
this
stuff
isn't
industrial
activity
where
construction
activity,
landfill
operations,
surface
mining
operations
that
have
all
the
same
attributes
of
being
done
out
in
the
field,
extraction
of
resources,
heavy
machinery,
etcetera,
are,
as
the
epa
itself
admits,
industrial
activity;
but,
somehow,
somehow,
logging,
which
has
all
the
same
attributes,
isn't.
and
so
that's
what
our
claim
is
going
forward
now.
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
address
that
because
i'm
not
sure
this
court
wants
to
get
into
all
of
this
stuff
yet;
but,
what
i
am
telling
this
court
is,
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
to
find
this
case
is
moot,
or
i
don't
think
this
court
would
want
to
touch
any
of
the
arguments
being
made
here
without
further
briefing,
at
least
as
to
the
new
rule.
we
do
think
it's
absolutely
clear
we
are
dealing
with
point
sources.
we
do
think
it's
absolutely
clear,
based
on
the
language
of
1369(b)(1),
that
there
just
can't
be
any
way
that
there
is
a
jurisdictional
or
whatever
other
kind
of
problem
you
want
to
label
it
with
us
bringing
a
claim
based
on
the
statute
itself.
the
new
regulation
just
simply
doesn't
fall
into
those.
so
if
this
court
dismisses
the
case,
we'll
go
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
tell
them
we
want
to
go
forward
for
the
following
reasons.
and
if
anybody
is
unhappy
with
what
happens
in
the
ninth
circuit,
obviously,
we
can
file
or
they
can
file
petitions
for
cert
in
this
court.
let
me
just
say
one
last
thing
to
this
court
about
what
we
view
as
really
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
nature
of
epa's
new
rule
and
why
you
shouldn't
touch
it.
remember,
i
said
--
and
this
is
in
epa's
regulations
themselves
--
that
construction
activity,
any
construction
activity
in
a
site
five
acres
or
more
is
industrial
activity.
so
if
a
developer
buys
a
parcel
of
forested
land
and
wants
to
build
a
subdivision
there,
and
the
first
thing
the
developer
does
is
punch
in
some
roads
and
drainage
systems
and
cut
some
trees
down
to
make
room
for
the
houses,
that
is
covered
by
the
epa's
stormwater
rules;
but,
if
a
logging
company
does
precisely
the
same
thing,
epa's
position
seems
to
be
it's
not
covered.
and
not
only
is
it
not
covered
if
it
happens
on
public
land,
but
i
think
at
least
the
implication
of
my
friend's
position
is
that
for
logging
companies,
of
which
there
are
many
in
the
northwest,
that
own
their
own
land,
own
their
own
giant
pieces
of
forest
land,
and
that
are
not
open
to
the
public,
that
are
not
open
to
hunters,
that
are
not
open
to
recreation,
but
they
have
their
own
logging
roads
on
their
own
private
lands
that
nobody
can
use
but
them,
i
still
think
his
position
is
that's
not
covered
by
the
act.
and
finally,
epa
has
one
other
thing
that
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
about
this
new
rule.
and
it's,
again,
got
our
heads
--
it
gets
our
heads
scratching
as
to
what
epa
is
really
doing
here.
epa
says
twice
in
the
preamble
to
their
new
rule,
once
on
page
7
and
also
on
page
12,
that
it,
quote,
retains
the
authority
to
designate
at
least
some
logging
roads
as
covered
by
its
so-called
point
--
phase
ii
system.
what
the
phase
ii
system
is,
is
under
section
1342(p),
which
is
the
stormwater
amendments
to
the
act,
it's
the
category
of
point
source
discharges
that
epa
says
are
not
a
covered
--
are
not
industrial
activity,
associated
industrial
activity,
but
we
nonetheless
are
going
to
require
certain
things
of
them.
this
is
the
critical
point.
epa
says
this
twice.
well,
the
only
authority
epa
would
have
to
regulate
any
logging
roads,
discharges
from
logging
roads,
is
if
they
are
point
sources,
because
you
don't
get
into
the
phase
ii
program,
you
don't
get
into
the
stormwater
amendments
unless
you
have
a
point
source.
if
it's
a
non-point
source,
then,
as
my
friend
has
pointed
out
quite
at
length
in
his
brief,
it's
entirely
up
to
the
state
and
epa
has
nothing
to
say
about
it.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
if
that's
all
we
had,
justice
scalia,
it
might
be
a
little
bit
ambiguous,
although
of
course
this
is
in
the
context
of
logging
the
roads.
but
look
at
page
12.
and
this
is
the
final
--
this
is
the
very
end
of
--
of
the
preamble.
the
last
sentence:
"epa
believes
that
stormwater
discharges
from
forest
roads,
including
logging
roads,
should
be
evaluated
under
section
402(p)(6).
"
the
only
authority
epa
has
for
doing
that
is
if
they
are
point
sources,
whereas
epa
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
that
says
that
they
are,
at
least
some
of
them,
are
not.
i
don't
know
if
it's
walking
away
from
that
or
is
planning
on
walking
away
from
that,
but
again
there
is
a
variety
of
questions
i
think
that
epa
should
have
to
address
and
answer
--
did
you
have
one?
i'm
sorry
--
that
epa
should
have
to
address
and
answer
before
any
court
does
anything
based
on
this
new
rule.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
epa
of
course
is
an
amicus,
justice
ginsburg,
and
epa
has
an
ongoing
right
to
intervene
in
any
citizen
suit.
that's
a
statutory
right.
and
it's
a
statutory
notice
that
any
plaintiff
in
a
citizen
suit
is
required
to
provide
to
epa,
which
we
did
provide
to
epa.
and
so
epa
has
every
right
to
intervene
in
the
case
at
any
point
as
a
party.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
i
think
that
epa
has
a
right
to
intervene
and
make
an
argument
that
the
case
is
moot
or
any
other
substantive
argument
they
would
like
to
make
back
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
of
course,
mootness,
if
it's
genuinely
moot,
which
for
all
of
these
reasons
we
think
of
course
it's
not,
but
mootness
is
an
article
iii
principle
that
an
amicus
could
raise
and
a
court
would
be
bound
to
consider
on
its
own.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that's
what
would
happen.
you
could
ask
them
how
they
would
like
to
proceed,
but
i
assume
that's
how
it
would
happen
and
i
assume
the
defendants
in
the
case
would
remain
the
same.
so
i'm
happy
to
answer
any
other
questions
about
what
the
case
looks
like
or
what
you
ought
to
do,
but
otherwise
i'll
submit
it.
