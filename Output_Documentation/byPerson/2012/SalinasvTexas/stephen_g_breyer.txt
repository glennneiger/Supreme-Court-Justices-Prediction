justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what's
the
law?
what
is.
i
mean,
joe
smith
leaves
a
--
a
blank
in
part
of
his
tax
return.
the
irs
gets
it,
later
it
turns
out
to
be
relevant,
and
the
prosecutor
wants
to
say,
hey,
he
left
this
blank.
okay?
now,
griffin
doesn't
apply,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
isn't
it
--
you're
not
going
to
say
that
any
--
any
time
you
refuse
to
tell
the
government
anything,
and
later
on
it
turns
out
to
be
relevant
to
a
criminal
prosecution,
that
that's
taken
as
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
i
mean,
do
you
want
to
go
that
far?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
you
need
a
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what
is
--
then
you
need
a
line.
so
where
is
--
there's
the
tax
case;
then
we
have
a
case
they're
selling
tickets
to
the
policeman's
ball
and
somebody
comes
to
the
door
and
the
policeman
says,
hey,
i
haven't
seen
you
around
before,
and
he
doesn't
answer.
okay?
now,
that's
probably
not
an
invocation.
and
then
we
have
the
clear
line,
which
in
custody,
and
now
you
want
to
extend
that
line.
and
so
what
i
want
to
know
if
i
follow
you
and
extend
it,
what
line
do
i
draw?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yes,
there's
no
doubt
he
was
remaining
silent,
but
the
issue
is
whether
he
was
trying
to
raise
his
fifth
amendment
right.
now,
suppose
your
rule
were,
whatever
the
situation,
where
either
the
individual
expressly
raises
his
right
or
at
the
least
it's
a
fair
implication
from
the
circumstance
that
he
was
trying
to
assert
his
right,
would
that
be
a
sensible
rule?
and
if
so,
how
would
your
case
stack
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
depends
on
the
circumstance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
well,
but
yes.
the
answer
is
going
to
be
yes,
because
we're
going
to
hear
it
in
one
minute,
because,
as
you
say,
it
follows
a
fortiori
for
berghuis.
if
you're
going
to
have
to
make
an
explicit
statement
to
invoke
your
fifth
amendment
right
when
you're
not
in
an
inherently
coercive
setting,
i
mean,
that's
going
to
be
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not
in
an
inherently
coercive
setting
as
you
are
in
the
miranda
situation,
you're
not
at
trial,
and
outside
those
two
situations,
you
have
to
say
explicitly,
i'm
invoking
the
fifth
amendment--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
tap
on
the
constitution
or
something
in
order
to
indicate--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what's
at
issue
and
that's
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
and
that's
saying
because
there
we
have
a
line.
it's
called
the
in
custody
line.
once
you
get
outside
of
custody--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
don't
want
to
make
the
government's
argument
for
them.
they'll
make
it
very
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
think
the
argument
will
be,
i
think,
at
least
in
my
mind,
that
if
after
sitting
there
for
45
minutes
--
or
maybe
it
was
an
hour
and
45
minutes
--
without
saying
anything,
i'm
--
i'm
maybe
taking
a
dissenting
position,
but
if
when
the
answer
doesn't
answer
over
that
long
period
of
time,
but
doesn't
say,
i
want
to
remain
silent,
if
that
long
period
of
behavior
is
insufficient
without
the
express
statement
to
show
that
he
wanted
to
remain
silent,
so
outside
custodial
setting,
should
it
be
insufficient
to
simply
remain
silent
to
show
that
--
you
see,
it's
argument
by
analogy,
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
that?
that
is
what
i'm
--
i'm
uncertain
about
this.
and
they
cite
page
468,
note
37
of
miranda.
what
is
the
law,
in
your
opinion
now,
in
respect
to
--
and
what
case
would
support
this?
a
defendant
comes
in,
he
is
warned
and
given
his
miranda
rights.
he
says
fine,
and
then
he
proceeds
to
answer
a
whole
bunch
of
questions.
then
they
ask
question
number
432,
he
says
nothing.
you
then
go
on
to
433,
434,
et
cetera,
and
he
answers
them
all.
okay?
at
the
trial,
the
lawyer
--
the
prosecutor
wants
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
in
the
face
of
that
single
question
--
though
answering
many,
many
more
--
he
remained
silent.
does
griffin
say
he
can
--
the
prosecutor
can
make
that
comment,
yes
or
no?
and
i'd
appreciate
the
government
answering
this
question,
too,
because
they're
--
if
they
--
are
they
speaking
here,
or
are
you
doing
the
whole
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
--
i'd
like
to
get
the
same
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
--
well,
now
they
cite
for
the
proposition,
i
think,
that
it
--
that
the
prosecutor
is
forbidden
to
make
that
comment,
note
37
of
miranda.
okay.
i
just
read
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
--
may
be
ambiguous
on
the
point.
it
says
you
have
the
right
to
maintain
immunity
in
the
face
of
an
accusation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
fine.
but
what's
your
opinion?
i
mean,
what
is
the
law
in
respect
to
that
single
point?
and
at
least
to
me,
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
know
your
opinion
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
authority,
or
is
it
just
your
opinion
that
we
have
to
go
on?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
are
you
--
are
you
conceding
the
--
the
point
that
they
make?
i
--
that
--
that
even
if
in
the
custodial
setting
he
waives
his
miranda
right.
he
answers
500
questions,
but
doesn't
answer
one
of
the
500,
that
the
prosecutor
cannot
comment
on
that
fact
that
he
didn't
answer
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it?
what
do
you
think?
he
says,
“
no,
you
can't
”,
and
he
quotes
miranda.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
do
you
have
a
view
on
it?
