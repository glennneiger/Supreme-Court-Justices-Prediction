chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-246,
salinas
v.
texas.
mr.
fisher.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he's
not
in
custody.
so
let's
say
he's
answering
the
questions.
all
of
a
sudden
he
gets
a
particular
question
and
he
says,
you
know,
it's
getting
late.
i
think
i'm
done
and
going
to
go
home.
is
that
an
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
is
that
something--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--is
that
something
that
could
be
used
against
him
at
trial?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
probative
if
that
he
says
that
--
he's
answering
all
the
questions,
they're
fine,
all
of
a
sudden
they
say,
well,
is
your
shotgun
going
to
match
the
shell?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
he
goes,
gosh,
it's
late.
i'm
going
to
go
home.
that
seems
as--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
seems
as
probative
as
the
silence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
curry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
particularly
since
he
did
want
to
talk
some
more,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
anders?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fisher,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.

our
opinion
this
morning
