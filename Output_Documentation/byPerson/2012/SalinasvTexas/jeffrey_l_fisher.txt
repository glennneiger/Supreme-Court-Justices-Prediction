mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
amendment
prohibits
using
a
person's
silence
during
a
noncustodial
police
interview
against
him
at
trial,
and
nothing
about
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
give
this
court
cause
to
refrain
from
applying
that
rule
here.
to
the
contrary,
the
state's
closing
argument
in
this
case
urging
the
jury
to
find
mr.
salinas
guilty
because,
quote,
"an
innocent
person
would
have
denied
law
enforcement's
accusations.
"
strikes
at
the
core
of
everything
the
griffin
rule,
and
indeed
the
fifth
amendment,
is
designed
to
prohibit.
it
evokes
an
inquisitorial
system
of
justice.
it
effectively
shifts
the
burden
of
proof
onto
the
defendant,
and
it
demeans
individual
dignity
by
conscripting
the
defendant
as
a
product
of
his
own
demise.
now,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
resisted
this
logic
and
held
the
fifth
amendment
didn't
apply,
because
there
was
supposedly
no
compulsion
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
there
was
no
physical
or
psychological
coercion
of
the
kind
that's
inherent
in
custody.
but
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
simply
misunderstood
the
nature
of
a
griffin
claim
and
the
nature
of
the
compulsion.
the
compulsion
that
mr.
salinas
faced
was
when
the
police
asked
him
the
question
about
ballistics
evidence,
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
to
avoid
supplying
the
state
with
incriminating
evidence
that
it
could
use
against
him.
if
he
answered
the
question--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
that's
not
the
holding
of
the
berghuis
case,
with
all
due
respect.
the
berghuis
case
was
about
whether
his
subsequent
statements
could
be
used
against
him.
this
court
didn't
hold
that
his
silence
that
preceded
those
statements
could
be
used
against
him,
and
indeed,
that
would
be
contrary
to
miranda
itself
in
footnote
37
where
the
court
said,
if
somebody
stands
mute
in
a
custodial
setting
in
the
face
of
law
enforcement
accusations,
they
may
not
be--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--if
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
i
don't
need
to.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
this
case
is--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well,
it's
sufficient
to
decide
this
case
to
say
that
a
noncustodial
police
interview
during
the
investigation
of
a
crime
where
they're
interviewing
somebody
about
--
who
is
--
who
is,
as
the
state
concedes,
a
suspect
in
a
crime.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
griffin
extends
a
little
bit
further,
and
remember,
the
solicitor
general
at
least
agrees
that
griffin
applies
in
a
noncustodial
setting.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that
would
be
admissible,
but
it
would
be
forbidden
for
the--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--yes.
that
word
would
be
admissible
if
the
state
had--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--perhaps.
but
the
state
--
what
the
state
would
not
be
able
to
do
would
be
to
argue
that
his
silence
and
refusal
to
answer
the
question
demonstrated
his
guilt.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that
may
well
cross
the
line.
you
have
the
exact
issue
that
arises
already
in
custodial
settings,
where
under
doyle
and
footnote
37
of
miranda
you've
held
that
silence
can't
be
used
against
a
criminal
defendant.
so,
justice
kennedy,
you're
right
that
questions
will
arise
in
two
ways.
one
is
whether
words
that
the
defendant
uses
are
tantamount
to
refusing
to
answer
the
question,
and
then
there
is
a
second
question
about
physical
demeanor
evidence.
the
law
is
already
sorted
out
on
this
in
the
lower
courts,
and
i
think
it's
a
very
workable
test.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
what
it
is,
and
the
reason
why
this
court
hasn't
seen
a
case,
itself
seen
a
case
like
that,
is
because
once
the
rule
is
established
that
the
prosecution
can't
use
silence
against
the
defendant,
the
temptation
drops
away
to
try
to
introduce
that
evidence
for
some
supposedly
different
purpose.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
insofar
as
demeanor
evidence
that
the
state
offers
has
communicative
values
and
the
state
argues
that
it
has
communicative
value,
independent
of
simply
what
the
defendant
looked
like
when
he
remains
silent,
then
it
--
then
it
may
well
be
able
to
introduce
that
evidence.
now,
as
i
said,
as
i
was
just
finishing
up
telling
justice
kennedy,
you're
not
going
to
have
hard
cases
in
this
respect
because
once
the
temptation
--
once
it's
clear
that
silence
can't
be
used,
then
the
prosecution
i
think
has
little
motivation
to
try
to
walk
that
line.
and
indeed,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
in
a
case
if
the
prosecution
said,
look,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
started
we
think
is
relevant
for
some
reason
independent
of
what
he
--
of
failing
to
answer
the
question.
the
jury
could
be
instructed,
as
they
are
in
griffin,
griffin
settings
already,
that
you
aren't
to
consider
the
defendant's
refusal
to
answer
the
question
against
him,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
and
i
--
and
this
is
where
justice
ginsburg's
question
came
from,
so
i
think
it's
very
important
for
me
to
be
clear
on
this.
a
person
in
a
noncustodial
setting
still
has
fewer
rights
than
a
person
in
a
custodial
setting.
what
the
court
held
in
berghuis
is
that
if
the
defendant
wants
to
exercise
his
prophylactic
right
under
miranda
to
cut
off
police
questioning
--
those
are
the
words
this
court
used
--
that
has
to
be
expressly
invoked
in
some
manner
during
the
interrogation.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
i
may,
let
me
focus
on
the
berghuis
question
and
then
turn
to
the
selective
silence
point.
the
reason
why
he
doesn't
have
--
mr.
salinas
doesn't
have
the
right
that
mr.
berghuis
had
to
cut
off
questioning.
that's
the
right
that
has
to
be
expressly
invoked,
and
it
indeed
can
only
be
effectuated
in
this
setting.
there
was
no
issue
in
berghuis,
i
don't
think,
that
his
silence
could
be
used
against
him.
the
state
never
argued
in
the
berghuis
case
that
because
he
failed
to
answer
for
2
hours
that
shows
he's
guilty.
what
the
state
argued
in
berghuis
was
the
fact
that
he
later
confessed
is
what
shows
that
he
is
guilty.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
you
can.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
let
me
separate
two
rights.
one
is
the
prophylactic
right
under
miranda
to
have
police
cease
asking
you
questions.
that's
one
right,
and
that
right
has
to
be
expressly
invoked
in
some
manner
during
the
interrogation,
after
you've
been
warned
in
order
to
effectuate
it.
there
is
a
separate
right,
which
is
the
genuine
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent.
and
this
court
said
in
miranda
itself
and
it's
never
questioned
since
that
that
right
doesn't
have
to
be
expressly
invoked.
so
the
question
is--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
so
i
think,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
he
didn't.
and
so
the
question
--
i
think
unless
the
court's
prepared
to
hold
that
even
an
expressed
invocation
could
be
used
against
him,
then
it
reduce
to
the
question
you
framed,
justice
kennedy.
and
so,
ask
yourself
whether
there's
any
good
reason
to
require
an
express
invocation
in
that
setting.
mr.
salinas,
remember,
did
expressly
invoke
his
right
to
--
fifth
amendment
right
to
remain
silent,
at
trial
in
a
timely
manner,
asking
for
the
evidence
to
be
excluded.
so
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
reason
to
ask
him
to
do
it
sooner.
and
our
argument
is
it's
unnecessary,
unfair,
and
a
rule
like
that
would
be
unadministrable.
so
let
me
walk
through
those
if
i
can.
it's
unnecessary
because
all
the
cases
the
solicitor
general
cites
for
an
express
invocation
principle
involve
a
scenario
where
the
government
has
no
good
reason
to
know
that
it's
seeking
incriminatory
information.
and,
justice
breyer,
this
is
the
limiting
principle
that
you
were
searching
for
in
the
tax
cases
and
the
like.
if
the
government
doesn't
know
or
have
good
reason
to
know
that
the
defendant
who
is
silent
is
likely
to
be
exercising
his
rights,
then
the
government
needs
to
be
put
on
notice,
because
the
government
may
--
may
well
challenge,
may
well
go
seek
a
court
order.
it
may
well
decide
to
grant
immunity.
it
may
do
a
number
of
things.
but
here,
the
government
would
do
absolutely
nothing
different.
police
would
have
done
absolutely
nothing
different.
indeed,
look
at
the
record
in
this
case.
what
the
solicitor
general
says
is
that
mr.
salinas
should
have
said,
"i
refuse
to
answer
that
question.
"
and
if
he
had
said
that
everything
would
be
different.
but
look
at
what
the
state
argued
at
trial
and
what
the
officer
testified.
the
officer
testified:
when
we
asked
him
that
question,
he
wouldn't
answer.
the
prosecution
argued
to
the
jury:
he
refused
to
answer
that
question.
so
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
setting
whether
he
was
remaining
silent.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yes.
i
think
as
long
as
the
latter
part
of
that
test,
justice
breyer
--
can
be
satisfied
by
exercising
the
right,
that
is
remaining
silent--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--in
a
setting
in
which
--
in
a
setting
in
which
the
government
has
every
good
reason
to
know
that
the
person
is
most
likely
to
be
relying
on
the
fifth
amendment.
and
here,
where
they
are
investigating
a
murder
and
bringing
in
somebody
as
a
suspect
and
asking
him
basically
did
you
commit
the
crime,
i
think
it's
a
fair
assumption
--
at
least
absent
any
clarification
by
the
police
--
remember,
when
he
was
silent,
the
police
would
have
had
every
right
to
say,
mr.
salinas,
why
aren't
you
answering
the
question?
and
so
the
police
could
clarify.
but
absent
any
clarification
from
either
the
police
or
the
suspect,
the
more
likely
than
not
scenario
--
and
that's
the
test
the
solicitor
general
agrees
should
be
used
--
the
more
likely
than
not
conclusion
there
is
that
he
is
exercising
the
right.
now--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
justice
sotomayor,
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
if
i
understood
your
hypothetical,
it
sounded
like
the
defendant
may
have
been
on
the
stand
and
that
would
be
an
impeachment
scenario
that's
entirely
different.
but
even--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--right.
so
but
--
but
even
if
that
were
the
case,
then
that
would
be
basically
using
his
statement
against
him.
and
so
a
material
omission
from
a
statement
is
not
the
same
as
silence.
here,
mr.
salinas
was
silent.
now,
it's
also
not
just
that
there's
no
good
reason
to
require
some
sort
of
magic
words
to
be
spoken
by
the
suspect,
but
it's
unfair.
remember,
the
states
tell
you
in
their
amicus
brief
that
if
you
affirm
in
this
case
and
adopt
the
rule
they're
asking
you
for,
police
officers
are
going
to
tell
people
in
its
custody,
which
would
be
nothing
more
than
an
accurate
statement
of
the
law,
sir,
if
you
are
silent
in
response
to
any
of
our
questions,
the
prosecution
is
going
to
argue
that
that
--
that
shows
that
you're
guilty.
they're
also
going
to
have
every
good
reason
to
bring
people
in.
i
think
this
goes
a
little
bit
to
justice
kennedy's
question
and
--
and
perhaps
just
yours
as
well,
the
fact
that
mr.
salinas
did
agree
to
commence
this
interview.
remember,
he
agreed--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i
think
you'd
have
to
ask
that
to
the
solicitor
general.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
the
one
requiring
an
invocation.
and
that
is
part
of
the
administrability
problem
that
the
rule
raises.
i
have
no
idea
of
all
the
permutations,
one
of
which
you've
raised--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--but
you
can
imagine
many
more.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
it
can
be
introduced.
it's
hard
to
understand
how
that
is
probative,
the
fact
that
he
said,
i
have
to
leave
now.
it's
time
to
go.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
yeah.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--well
--
and
so
--
what
the
state
cannot
do
is
what
it
did
in
this
case,
and
sort
of
transform
that
into
he
refused
to
answer
and
therefore
it
shows
he's
guilty.
and
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
part
of
the
unfairness
and
the
difficulty
here,
it's
not
--
it's
just
that
--
yes,
mr.
salinas
did
come
to
the
police
station,
but
remember
why
he
came
to
the
police
station,
because
they
said,
we
want
to
bring
you
in
to
clear
you
as
a
suspect,
to
get
elimination
prints.
so
he
was
effectively
told
to
come
in
so
that
we
can
clear
you
as
a
suspect,
asked
perfectly
innocuous
questions
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview,
and
then
everything
shifted
on
a
dime
to
this
one
“
gotcha
”
question.
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
reasonable
and
customary
in
out-of-court
settings
where
the
defendant
isn't
on
the
stand
and
so
telling
some
story
now
trying
to
backtrack
it,
but
out
of
court,
to
be
able
to
selectively
exercise
your
right
to
silence
when
you
feel
now
law
enforcement
is
turning
against
me.
and
remember
--
this
is
the
other
part
about,
justice
kennedy,
your
question.
of
course,
people
know
they
have
a
right
to
remain
silent,
so
why
not
--
why
not
ask
them
to
invoke
it.
remember,
people
in
this
setting
generally
don't
have
lawyers.
they
don't
have
a
right
to
lawyers.
what
does
the
layperson
know?
the
layperson
knows,
i
have
a
right
to
remain
silent.
that's
what
the
layperson
knows.
the
layperson
doesn't
know
i
have
to
say
some
sort
of
magic
words.
and
the
police,
believe
me,
aren't
going
to
tell
him
that
he
does
in
order
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
relevant
distinction
there,
justice
alito,
as
long
as
an
investigatory
interview
--
and
this
court
has
said
time
and
again,
whether
it's
berkemer
in
a
traffic
stop
or
plenty
--
or
royer,
that
the
police
can
try
to
initiate
consensual
encounters.
and
the
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
people
don't
have
to
participate
in
them
and
they
can
cut
them
off
at
any
time.
and
it
would
be
odd--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--in
--
well,
if
he
wants
to
talk
to
them--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--i'm
not
sure
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent,
no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
think
that
might,
depending
on
the
precision
of
the
hypothetical,
be
a
little
bit
of
a
difficult
--
different
case.
but
if
the
person
said,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
criminal
activity,
started
giving
statements
about
a
--
about
a
past
crime,
so
it
was
an
investigatory
interview,
i
think
it
may
well
apply.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
i
don't
want
a
gray
area
opinion.
remember,
justice
kennedy,
at
least
the
solicitor
general
--
and
i'll
let
the
state
speak
for
itself
--
but
the
solicitor
general
agrees
that
griffin
rule
applies
in
a
noncustodial
setting.
i
--
i
totally
understand
there's
a
bright
line
between
custody
and
noncustody,
and
so
a
custodial
suspect
is
in
a
different
situation
than
a
noncustodial
suspect.
but
all
i'm
saying
is,
again,
in
agreement
with
the
solicitor
general,
whereas
all
we
disagree
on
is
whether
the
magic
words
need
to
be
spoken,
that
a
person
who
is
at
least
in
a
police
investigatory
setting
and
so
the
police
would
reasonably
expect
that
a
failure
to
speak
or
answering
your
question
was
relying
on
a
fifth
amendment--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that's
precisely
what
the
court
said
already
in
footnote
37
in
miranda,
what
the
lower
courts
have
depended
on
for
a
generation
now,
and
i
don't
think
my
opponents
are
even
arguing
to
the
contrary.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
right.
fair
enough.
i
think
that's
perfectly
well-established
law.
and
so
the
reason
is,
is
there
any
reason
to
distinguish
for
purposes
of
the
griffin
rule.
i
understand
those
reasons
to
distinguish
in
the
--
in
the
settings
that
berghuis
raises,
but
for
purposes
of
the
griffin
rule,
is
there
any
reason
to
distinguish
between
a
custodial
and
a
noncustodial
setting?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
but
--
but--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
justice
breyer,
this
is
crucial.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
if
mr.
salinas
had
been
in
a
--
if
everything
about
the
case
was
identical,
but
he'd
been
in
custody,
there
would
be
no
argument
that
his
silence
could
be
used
against
him.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
but
it's
not
because
of
the
physical
or
inherent
pressures
of
custody,
because
what
the
court
has
said
time
and
again
is
that
after
somebody
receives
their
miranda
warnings,
they
have
a
free
and
deliberate
choice
whether
to
talk.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
well,
no,
but
i
do
want
--
i
do
want
to
make
sure
that
the
court
understands
the
critical
difference
between
the
express
invocation
requirement
that
this
court
established
in
berghuis
and
what
i'm
asking
for
today.
and
the
express
invocation
requirement
in
berghuis
is
the
--
is
--
is
to
administer
the
miranda
prophylactic
rule
that
the
police
have
to
stop
asking
somebody
questions
when
they
invoke
their
rights.
the
rights
they've
just
been
advised
of,
remember.
it
didn't
hold
in
berghuis
and
it
--
and
it's
never
held
that
if
somebody
is
mirandized,
and
let's
say
mr.
berghuis
was
mirandized
and
just
remained
silent
for
two
hours,
and
then
the
police
said
to
themselves,
oh,
this
guy
is
never
going
to
talk.
we
end
the
interview.
there
would
have
been
no
argument
the
state
could
have
made
in
that
case,
that
his
silence
could
be
used
against
him.
and
so
i
understand
that
--
that,
you
know,
i'm
--
that
custody
is
different,
but
in
terms
of
the
express
invocation
requirement,
there's
no
express
invocation
requirement
in
custody
and
there's
no
reason
for
it
here.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
i
understand,
but
his
silence
wasn't
able
to
be
used
against
him
in
berghuis;
his
state
--
his
later
statements
were.
and
so
yes,
you
could
have
a
scenario--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--pardon?
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
exactly.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
precisely.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
that's
exactly
my
point.
and
remember,
again,
the
layperson
in
this
setting
who
knows
--
if
there's
one
thing
the
layperson
knows,
and
most
every
american
knows
this,
they
have
a
right
to
remain
silent.
so
somebody
nervous
in
this
setting,
without
a
lawyer,
the
one
sanctuary
they
have
is
simply
not
to
talk.
if
you
issue
an
opinion
that
says,
as
the
solicitor
general
would
like,
you
have
to
pronounce
some
sort
of
magic
words,
it's
terribly
unfair
and
terribly
misleading,
and
again,
for
no
good
reason.
and
it
raises
all
kinds
of
administrability
problems.
the
court
is
going
to
have
an
absolute,
i
think,
flood
of
cases
of
all
the
permutations
of
somebody
under
different
kind
of
police
warnings
or
the
other
that
may
be
given
ahead
of
time
and
different
kind
of
verbal
formulations.
maybe
he
says,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
something
else.
maybe
he
says,
as
the
chief
justice
explained,
i'm
going
to
leave
now.
maybe
he
actually
just
doesn't
show
up
for
the
interview.
there
is
innumerable
permutations.
the
easy
rule--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--no.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
so
as
to
where
you
draw
the
line,
if
i
understand
your
question,
as
to
where
an
express
invocation
before
trial
would
be
required,
you
are
going
to
have
to
draw
a
line.
i
think
it's
very
easy
to
draw
the
line
and
just
say
a
police
investigatory
interview,
because
that's
the
setting
where
the
police
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
silence
is
an
exercise
of
the
right.
all
the
other
settings,
whether
they
be
tax
settings,
whether
they
be
immigration
cases,
all
the
totally
disparate
settings
the
solicitor
general
cites
cases
involving,
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
require
an
advance
indication
there.
but
remember,
the
court
said
in
chavez
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
a
trial
right,
and
so
invoking
it
at
trial
is
perfectly
timely
in
the
ordinary
setting.
the
only
question
is
whether
you
should
have
some
sort
of
special
requirement
for
special
reason.
we
think
there
is
no
good
reason
and
it
would
be
very
unfair.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
make
three
points.
first,
justice
breyer,
your
question
about
the
state
of
the
law
with
respect
to
question
number
432.
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
4,
we
cite
cases
that
are
all
fifth
amendment
cases,
and
canterbury
also,
which
is
a
tenth
circuit
case
cited
elsewhere
in
our
brief,
uniformly
holding
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies.
the
solicitor
general,
when
they
speak
about
a
circuit
split
with
relation
to
doyle,
they're
talking
about
impeachment
cases.
remember,
doyle
and
jenkins,
which
are
the
cases
the
state
cited
to
you
in
response
to
your
question
are
impeachment
cases
that
are
entirely
different.
second,
if
i
--
we
can
look
at
the
transcript
this
afternoon,
but
i
believe
both
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
said
to
you
today
if
mr.
salinas
would
have
said,
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
question,
then
he
would
win,
then
griffin
would
apply;
but
because
it
was
somehow
ambiguous,
that
it
shouldn't,
that
is
ridiculous.
if
you
look
at
the
transcript
in
this
case,
what
did
the
officer
testify
when
he
said
--
he
asked
him
the
question,
he
said
he
did
not
answer.
what
did
the
prosecutor
argue
to
the
jury
in
closing?
verbatim
of
what
the
state
is
telling
you
today
is
all
mr.
salinas
had
to
say.
at
closing
the
state
said,
the
police
officer
testified
that
he
wouldn't
answer
that
question.
he
didn't
want
to
answer
that.
so
the
whole
principle
behind
express
invocation
jurisprudence
is
to
put
the
state
and
the
police
on
fair
notice
that
somebody
is
exercising
the
right
to
remain
silent.
there
was
zero
ambiguity
in
this
case
that
was
going
on.
so
it
explains
why
the
rule
that
the
state
and
the
solicitor
general
have
fallen
back
on
in
court
today
is
formalism
of
the
absolute
worst
kind,
and
the
only
thing
that
this
formal
requirement
of
saying
some
sort
of
magic
words
--
and
i
agree
with
justice
kagan,
i
don't
know
what
they
are
--
but
whatever
they
are,
what
--
exactly
what
the
state
argued
to
the
jury
apparently
would
have
been
enough,
is
just
nothing
more
than
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
who
is
told
through
culture
and
learning
that
he
has
a
right
to
remain
silent.
and
he
does
the
one
thing
that
is
consistent
with
his
right,
which
is
exercising
it,
and
somehow
the
state
is
telling
you
that
it
can
walk
into
court
and
say,
because
he
remains
silent,
he's
guilty
of
a
crime.
jury,
you
should
conclude
he's
guilty
of
a
crime.
and,
justice
sotomayor,
when
you
asked
the
state,
well,
what
about
an
officer
that
tells
the
defendant,
as
he
will
have
every
incentive
to
do,
in
south
carolina
v.
neville
in
a
roughly
comparable
situation
that
law
enforcement
actually
admitted
they
were
already
doing
it,
but
the
states
tell
you
they'll
do
it
here,
when
the
officer
says,
if
you
don't
answer,
we're
going
to
use
that
against
you,
the
state
said
that
would
be
coercion.
but
the
officer
would
be
doing
nothing
more
than
stating
the
rule
the
court
is
asking
you
to
announce
today.
so
wouldn't
the
defendant
know
the
law?
don't
we
assume
that
the
suspect
knows
the
law?
and
the
state's
telling
you,
well,
if
the
officer
tells
the
person
what
the
law
is,
it's
coercion.
so
really,
what
we're
asking
today
is
nothing
radical.
it's
nothing
of
a
departure
of
our
deepest
traditions,
which
require
the
government
to
shoulder
the
load
itself,
to
prove
the
case
itself,
and
not
to
enlist
the
defendant
as
an
instrument
in
his
own
demise.
people's
silence,
it
is
the
time-honored
concept
of
the
fifth
amendment
which,
remember,
was
created
for
out-of-court
questioning
by
law
enforcement
authorities,
that
people
who
remain
silent
could
not
have
that
used
against
them
at
trial.
and
finally,
i
hope
the
--
the
confusion
with
respect
to
the
berghuis
as
related
to
this
case
has
been
dispelled.
i
think
justice
kagan
got
it
exactly
right.
but
remember,
another
way
to
make
it
clear
is
that
if
mr.
salinas
had
said
in
response
to
the
question,
i'd
like
for
you
to
stop
asking
me
questions,
the
police
wouldn't
have
had
to
honor
that.
somebody
not
in
custody
doesn't
have
a
right
to
have
questioning
cut
off,
so
the
police
could
have
kept
asking
him
questions.
that's
the
only
right
that
a
custodial
suspect
has
and
needs
to
expressly
invoke.
the
right
to
remain
silent
is
not
something
that's
ever
had
to
be
expressly
invoked
by
somebody
in
custody
or
not
in
custody,
and
there's
no
good
reason
to
require
it
to
be
invoked
here.
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'd
be
happy
to
entertain
them.
otherwise,
i'll
submit
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
no,
that
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
fisher
--that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
and
we
wouldn't
have
a
problem
with
the
state
making
legitimate
arguments
based
on
demeanor
evidence
that
is
itself
communicative
as
opposed
to
what
it
did
in
this
case,
which
is
argue
that
his
silence
demonstrated
his
guilt.
