mr.
alan
k.
curry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
absent
an
invocation,
a
defendant's
failure
to
answer
a
question
during
a
noncustodial,
voluntary
interview
should
not
be
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
it
should
be--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--well--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--yeah,
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
sufficient
to
convict
him.
and
that
--
that
hypothetical
might
suggest
that
the
probative
value
of
that
particular
failure
to
answer
a
question
was
less--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--well--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--i
think
one
of
the
things
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do,
justice
sotomayor,
is
to
recognize
that
silence,
certainly
as
occurred
in
this
case,
doesn't
always
occur
in
a
vacuum.
and
the
defendant's
failure
to
answer
this
question,
accompanied
by
things
that
he
did
along
with
or
contemporaneously
with,
you
know,
the
shuffling
of
the
feet,
the
biting
of
the
bottom
lip,
revealed
a
guilty
conscience
on
his
part.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
right.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
correct.
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
the
import
of
our
argument.
and
we've
referenced
this
court's
language
in
baxter
to
that
extent,
that
a
jury
can
give
what
weight
they
wish
to
give
it.
but
the--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--i
don't
know
that
that's
an
invocation,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
know--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--number
one,
i
don't
think
a
prosecutor
ever
would
argue
that
because
that's
ambiguous
and
not
probative,
and
i
think
--
not
probative
for
someone
just
to
not
come
in
when
police
offer
them
a
chance
to
come
in.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
right.
the
legal
theory
of
guilt
in
that
situation
would
be
lessened
than
it
is
in
this
case,
because
there
is
no
--
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
that
defendant
was
guilty
necessarily
because
he
decided
not
to
show
up
to
the
police.
but
here
in
this
situation,
the
defendant's
failure
to
answer
the
question,
accompanied
by
the
other
things
that
he
did,
did
reveal
a
guilty
conscience
on
his
part,
and
it
was
nothing
to
reflect
that
he
was
trying--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--i
don't
believe
he
has,
your
honor.
i
mean
if
he
--
you
said
he
was
provided
miranda
rights,
so
maybe
they
feel
he
is
in
custody
or
not,
but--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--he
is
guilty
if
he
revealed
a
guilty
conscience,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
not
what
we're
--
that's
not
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
here.
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
say
that
every
time
silence
occurs
that's
necessarily
going
to
be
probative,
and
every
time
silence
occurs
that's
necessarily
going
to
be
something
that
we
utilize.
we're
merely
saying
that
in
this
particular
situation
the
defendant
needs
to
tell
something
to
the
police
in
order
to
reveal
that
he
is
relying
on
a
constitutional
right
and
not
merely
having--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
i
believe
that
has
been
our
position,
your
honor.
we
do
have
some
alternative
argues
as
well
based
upon
this
court's
jurisprudence.
but
i
think
the
government
and
we
both
agree
that
the
defendant
in
this
particular
situation
would
need
to
invoke.
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
we
proceed.
and
we
are
not
proceeding
just
upon
berghuis
v.
thompkins.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
we
would
not
attempt
to
just
--
we
would
not
attempt
to
introduce
anything,
for
example
“
i
plead
the
fifth
”,
"i
don't
want
to
talk
any
more.
"
something
like
that.
no,
we
would
not
be
introducing
that.
i
do
believe
that
would
be
a
rule
--
a
violation
of
the
rule--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--correct,
if
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
correct.
that's
the
rule--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--i
think,
your
honor,
i
would
not
want
to
--
i
would
not
want
to
introduce
a
statement
that
a
defendant
was
relying
on
a
constitutional
right
by
saying,
"i
don't
want
to
talk
any
more.
"
as
opposed
to
the
mere
silence,
which
might
be
probative
in
conjunction
with
other
evidence.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
it
might.
but
it
also
might
suggest
that
he's
having
difficulty
coming
up
with
an
exculpatory
response.
it
might
suggest
that
he
can't
think
of
a
good
answer.
it
might
suggest
that
he
is
worried
about
the
question
and
he
is
thinking
more
about
how
worried
he
is
about
the
question
than
how
he
wants
to
respond
to
it.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
correct.
he
continued
to
respond,
you
know,
several
questions
thereafter,
continuing
to
provide
exculpatory
responses.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
yes,
your
honor.
that
may
be
--
that
may
be
a
permissible
inference.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
necessarily
means
that
he
was
invoking
his
fifth
amendment
right,
because
he
did
continue
to
talk.
he
already
knew
what
the
police
were
investigating.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
to
--
to
allow
the
use
of
evidence
if
there
was
no
invocation
involved.
in
jenkins
v.
anderson,
justice
stevens
recognized
the
importance
of
an
invocation,
even
in
--
even
in
that
type
of
situation.
this
court
--
it's
not
just
berghuis
v.
thompkins
that
we're
relying
upon,
where
the
court
has
recognized
the
necessity
of
an
invocation.
garner
v.
united
states
says
the
same
thing,
that
--
that
an
invocation
is
necessary
for
fifth
amendment
rights.
and
i
know
that
we
don't
have
a
case
that
is
squarely
on
--
on
four
with
this
one.
but
all
the
defendant
would
have
to
say
is,
i
don't
want
to
talk
anymore,
or
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
question,
and
then
we
would
be
in
a
completely
different
posture
at
this
point.
but
here,
the
--
the
defendant
failed
to
answer
a
question,
and
did
other
things
that
revealed
a
guilty
conscience
on
his
part,
and
that
is
precisely
the
type
of
evidence
that
we
believe
that
we
can
introduce.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
well,
number
one,
because
the
hypotheticals
are
different.
in
--
in
our
particular
situation,
the
defendant
did
answer
questions,
and
only
did,
you
know,
fail
to
answer
one
particular
question.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
okay.
in
--
in
berghuis
v.
thompkins,
this
court
looked
at
the
ambiguous
nature
of
whether
or
not
the
invocation
had
occurred.
if,
in
your
hypothetical,
the
defendant
failed
to
answer
any
questions
whatsoever--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--but
it
could
be
a
suggestion
where
he
was
attempting
to
exercise
the
--
the
right,
because
he
never
answered
anything.
but
in
our
situation,
the
defendant
can't
be
said
to
have
been
doing
that.
he
can't
be
said
to
have
been
exercising
the
right
because
he
failed
to
answer
a
question,
but
answered
several
other
questions.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
that's
one
of
the
reasons,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
well,
we're
saying
that
you
cannot
infer
an
assertion
of
a
fifth
amendment
right
based
upon
this.
we
cannot
infer
that
he
was
necessarily
asserting
his
fifth
amendment
right,
whether
to
cut
off
questioning
or
stop
talking
altogether,
or,
you
know--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--no.
i
think
you
need
to
invoke
in
every
--
every
noncustodial
encounter
if
--
if
you
do
not
want
the
things
that
you
say
to
be
utilized
against
you.
if
you
--
if
you
want
to
--
you
know,
if
you
want
to
be
prevented
from
that
evidence
being
utilized,
you
have
to
say,
i
don't
want
to
talk
anymore,
or
i
plead
the
fifth,
or
whatever
the
words--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--no.
no.
if
he
didn't
answer
any
questions,
then
--
then
it
would
be
drawn
closer
to
--
to
berghuis
v.
thompkins,
in
which
this--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--correct.
correct.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
but
--
but
the
defendant
in
berghuis
did
answer
some
questions,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
makes
it
different
from
berghuis.
in
--
in
that
--
in
that
case,
the
defendant
did
ultimately--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--correct.
he--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--well,
it
is
a
different
question,
but
here,
i
think
the
police
were,
quote-unquote,
“
going
away
”.
i
mean,
they
--
they
finished
their
questioning
at
some
point.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
but
this
court's
case
law
still
requires
an
invocation.
and
the
rule
we're
asking
this
court
to
adopt
would
essentially
settle
the
split
that
largely
exists
in--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--no,
the
government
is
also
arguing
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
yes.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
correct.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
right.
i
think
the
reliance
of
on
the
footnote
is
--
is--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
has
extended
griffin
to
this
particular
type
of
fact
situation,
and
griffin
wouldn't
apply
to
that.
mr.
alan
k.
curry
well,
i
believe
this
court
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
extend
griffin.
for
example,
doyle
v.
ohio,
basically,
the
court
did
not
do
that.
this
court
had
the
--
the
opportunity
to
extend
griffin
in
fletcher
v.
weir
and
did
not
do
that.
so
i
do
not
believe
this
court
has
necessarily,
you
know,
sought
to
always
attempt
to
extend
griffin
in
that
situation.
now,
we
--
i
see
some
ambiguity
in
the
standing
mute
phrase
from
footnote
37.
does
that
mean
not
talking
at
all?
does
that
mean
not
answering
one
particular
question?
in
your
hypothetical,
if
it
was
as
probative
as
it
was
in
our
case,
you
know,
that
might
be
something
the
prosecution
would
want
to
use
without
violating
the
fifth
amendment
right,
because
there's
no
clear
indication
that
the
defendant
did
in
fact
rely
upon
his
fifth
amendment
right.
now,
i
don't
want
to,
you
know,
misread
footnote
37,
but
that's
how
we
read
footnote
37,
because
of
the
absence
of
--
there's
many,
many
cases
cited
there,
and
it's
not
clear
that
it's
attempted
to
apply
an
--
an
extension
of
griffin
in
that
situation.
the
rule
we're
--
we're
offering
here
would
not
--
would
not
change
the
law
with
regard
to
how
it
exists
in
much
of
the
federal
circuits.
in
much
of
the
federal
circuits,
these
defendants
where
--
where
the
courts
have
held
that
we
cannot
utilize
this
evidence,
those
defendants
have
in
fact
done
something
to
invoke.
so
i
think
the
--
the
rule
that
we're
asking
the
court
to
adopt
would
allow
for
these
--
that
case
law
to
stand;
i.e.,
if
a
defendant
says
i
don't
want
to
talk
anymore,
i
plead
the
fifth,
you
know,
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
issue
a
rule
that
says
that
we
can
introduce
that.
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
--
to
introduce
is
consistent
with
this
court's
case
law
that
would
require
an
invocation,
or
some
invocation
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
was
being
relied
upon,
and
not
just
a
difficulty
with
the
question,
or
i
can't
think
up
an
exculpatory
answer
for
that
particular
question,
so
i
don't
know
what
to
say.
i
mean,
there,
the
defendant
is
not
relying
upon
a
constitutional
right.
and
i
think
we're
asking
this
court
to
--
to
look
at
whether
an
inference
has
to
be
made
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
is
being
done,
or
perhaps
another
inference
can
be
--
can
be
provided.
and
baxter
v.
palmigiano
allows
for
acquiescence,
you
know,
to
--
to
be
something
that
we
can
utilize
against
a
defendant.
here,
the
jury--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--i
could
perceive
then,
your
honor,
the
--
the
trial
court
upholding
a
claim
by
the
defendant
that
he
was
coerced
at
that
point,
that
at
that
point,
the
officer--
mr.
alan
k.
curry
--no.
if
--
i
don't
know
that
i
would
say
griffin
is
protecting
it,
but
what
i
would
say
is
this
court's
penalty
jurisprudence
would
say
that
when
a
penalty
flows
directly
from
something
the
defendant
is,
you
know,
either
saying
or
not
saying,
you
know,
that
could
be
a
problem.
so
when
an
officer
says,
you
know,
"i'm
going
to
hold
--
hold
against
you
your
failure
to
answer
a
question.
"
you
know,
that
can
be
something
where
the
court
might
utilize
as
--
as
for
some
sort
of
penalties
flown.
justice
--
justice
stevens
said,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
mckune
v.
lile,
that
there
is
an
appreciate
difference
between
some
sort
of
sanction,
official
sanction
being
placed
upon
a,
you
know,
of
essentially
disobeying
of
an
order
as
opposed
to
a
voluntary
choice
arising
from
--
from
just
a
possible
adverse
consequence.
and
here,
i
think,
the
fact
situation
that
confronts
this
court
in
this
case
is
just
the
risk
of
an
adverse
consequence
and
not
something
that
necessarily
is
going
to
occur.
however,
if
an
officer
says,
"i'm
necessarily
going
to
use
this
against
you.
"
the
adverse
consequence
may
become
more
--
more
tangible
at
that
point.
that
isn't
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
i
also
want
to
disagree
with
mr.
fisher
with
regard
to
his
suggestion
that
the
police
essentially
manipulated
this.
if
you
look
on
the
joint
appendix,
page
14,
lines
9
and
10,
the
officer
clearly
says
that
he
wants
mr.
salinas
to
come
down
to
the
police
station
and
talk,
as
well
as
do
elimination
fingerprints.
the
officer
had
already
been
questioned.
these
people
knew
we
were
investigating
a
double
murder.
these
people
knew
that
they
were
looking
for
a
shotgun.
they
now
have
a
shotgun
that
they
got
from
the
defendant.
so
this
defendant
was
not,
you
know,
all
of
a
sudden
sprung
on
him
the
idea
that
they
were,
you
know,
looking
for
him
as
the
possible
suspect
at
that
point
when
they
asked
a
ballistics
question.
