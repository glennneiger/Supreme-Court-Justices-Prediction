why
isn't
it
--
why
isn't
it
like
the
berg
--
is
it
berghuis
case?
there
was
a
case
of
someone
who
was
given
miranda
warnings
and
even
so,
the
court
said
he
was
silent.
he
didn't
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
therefore,
his
silence
can
be
commented
on.

mr.
fisher,
but
then
--
do
--
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you're
saying
demeanor
is
different,
so,
although
it
was
impermissible
to
comment
on
silence,
it
was
okay
to
say
he
looked
down,
he
seemed
to
be
sweating,
he
was
very
nervous,
he
was
shuffling
his
feet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
the
most
logical
inference
from
the
silence
not
that
he
isn't
quick
enough
to
come
up
with
an
exculpatory
answer,
but
that
it
would
incriminate
him
if
he
answered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
he
could
--
he
could
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
one
set
of
questions
and
not
another.
and
what's
disturbing
me
about
your
position,
if
it's
--
if
you
have
--
someone
being
interrogated
who
is
savvy
will
say,
“
i
plead
the
fifth
”.
and
somebody
who
is
not
that
smart
is
just
silent.
to
make
a
difference
between
those
two
people
on
whether
comment
can
be
made
on
the
failure
to
respond
is
troublesome.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you've
--
you've
said
in
your
brief
that
there
might
be
a
whole
other
--
many
other
reasons
for
remaining
silent,
and
i
--
i
suggested
that
the
--
in
--
in
this
kind
of
scenario,
the
most
likely
reason
that
the
suspect
will
clam
up
is
that
he
fears
incrimination.
but
what
--
what
obvious
other
reasons
unrelated
to
the
fifth
amendment
why
a
defendant
might
remain
silent?
i
mean,
the
griffin
rule
is
he
doesn't
have
to
say
“
i
plead
the
fifth
”
because
we
assume
that
when
he
doesn't
take
the
stand
he
is
doing
so
because
he
doesn't
want
to
incriminate
himself.
justice
ruth

okay.
but
--
but
i
don't
think
you
--
you
were
going
to
tell
me
this
great
deal
of
conduct,
what
silence
could
mean
other
than
“
i
fear
incrimination
”.
what
else
is--
