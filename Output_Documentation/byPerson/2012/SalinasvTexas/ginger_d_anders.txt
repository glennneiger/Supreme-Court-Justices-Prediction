ms.
ginger
d.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
minnesota
v.
murphy,
this
court
applied
the
general
rule
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
not
self-executing
and
that
a
suspect
must
invoke
it
in
order
to
claim
its
protection
to
a
noncustodial
interview
in
which
the
--
the
probation
officer
doing
the
questioning
was
aware
that
the
questions
that
she
asked
could
be
incriminating.
the
court
there
held
that
because
the
suspect
had
not
invoked
his
fifth
amendment
rights,
his
statements
could
be
used
against
him
as
evidence
at
trial.
a
suspect's
silence
should
similarly
be
admissible
against
him
when
he
fails
to
expressly
invoke
the
privilege.
requiring
invocation--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
when
a
citizen
is
voluntarily
interacting
with
the
police
and
there
--
there
is
no
coercion
because
it's
not
a
custodial
situation,
we
expect
that
person
to
be
treated
as
fully
capable
of
deciding
whether
or
not
to
assert
his
rights.
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
united
states
v.
drayton
in
an
analogous
context,
which
is
whether
someone
has
voluntarily
consented
to
a
search.
the
person,
even
if
he
is
not
told
that
--
that
he
can
refuse
to
--
to
consent,
we
still
assume
that
he
knew
that
he
could
refuse
to
consent,
and,
therefore,
it
was
a
voluntary
choice.
and
i
think
you
can
draw
the
same
inference
here,
that
when
someone
--
we
--
i
think
we
all
agree
that
most
people
know
--
people
know
what
their
fifth
amendment
rights
are,
and,
therefore,
they
can
assert
them
when
they
don't
face
any
coercive
pressure.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
and
so
when
the
person
does
not
do
that--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
the
reason
that
we
don't
require
invocation
in
the
miranda
setting,
i
think
highlights
the
fundamental
difference
between
custodial
interrogation
and
noncustodial
interrogation.
so
in
the
custodial
setting,
the
court
has
said
that
--
that
the
suspect
faces
inherent
coercive
pressures
to
confess--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--and
therefore--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--exactly.
that's
why
we
give
the
warnings.
and
in
the
warnings,
we
promise
the
suspect
that
his
silence
will
not
be
used
against
him.
and
so
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
doyle
v.
ohio,
that
because
of
that
promise,
the
suspect
does
not
have
to
expressly
invoke,
and
his
silence
can't
be
used
against
him.
but
in
the
voluntary
situation,
we
presume
that
the
suspect
knows
his
rights,
and
because
he
is
not
facing
any
pressure,
he
can
simply
say,
"i
don't
want
to
answer
that
question.
"
and
so
when
he
doesn't
say
that--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--that's
right.
the
--
the
griffin
rule
says
--
or
it's
premised
on
the
idea
that
when
you
fail
to
testify
at
trial
you're
inherently
exercising
your
fifth
amendment
right.
but
i
think
when
you're
looking
at
a
--
a
noncustodial
interrogation,
the
question
whether
the
person
is
trying
to
exercise
his
fifth
amendment
right,
i
think
the
operative
question
is
not
whether
he
wants
to
avoid
inculpating
himself,
it's
whether
he
wants
to
refuse
to
answer
as
a
matter
of
right.
and
i
think
we
know
that
because,
if
you
look
at
the
interview
as
a
whole,
presumably
his
overarching
motivation
is
not
to
inculpate
himself.
that's
why
his
statement
--
his
statements
can
be
used
against
him
at
trial,
because
those
statements
we
--
we've
--
the
court
held
in
minnesota
v.
murphy,
those
statements
are
inconsistent
with
a
desire
to
refuse
to
answer
as
a
matter
of
right.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
that
raises
a--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
there
is
--
there
is
a
circuit
split
on
that,
and
--
and
i
think
the
circuit
split
shows
that
it
raises
a
different
analytical
question
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
get
into
here.
the
circuit
split
is
that
some
courts
say,
as
i
understand
it,
that
even
after
the
person
waives
his
miranda
rights,
doyle
still
applies,
and
so
you
can't
use
his
silence
against
him.
and
some
of
those
other
courts
say,
no,
once
he
has
waived
his
miranda
rights,
he
is
essentially
in
the
same
situation
as
he
would
be
if
he
weren't
in
custody--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
--
i
think
we
think
that
the
better
view
is
that
doyle
probably
does
not
apply,
but
i
think
there
is
a
serious
question
there.
and
i
think
the
court
doesn't
have
to
resolve
it
here
because,
again,
that
highlights
a
distinction
between
custodial
and
noncustodial
interrogation,
that
once
the
suspect
has
been
promised--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
--
i
think
the
standard--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--right.
so
like
this
case
except
20
questions.
well,
i
think
the
standard
is
whether
the
--
the
suspect
has
done
something
that
reasonably
can
be
construed
as
invocation.
this
is
the
standard
that
the
court
announced
in
united
states
v.
quinn
a
long
time
ago,
but
it's
also
the
same
formulation
that
the
court
used
in
davis
and
berghuis.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
if
he
expresses
the
desire
not
to
answer
the
question,
that
is
sufficient
because
he
is
saying,
"i'm
not
going
to
answer
that.
"
and
implicitly
he
has
a
right
not
to
do
that.
i
think
the
20
questions
hypothetical
that
justice
kennedy
proposed,
probably
that
would
not
be
sufficient
by
--
by
analogy
to
thompkins
where
the
suspect
sat
silent
for
two
hours.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
absolutely.
i
think
--
i
think
there
are
several
types
--
there
are
several
mental
states
that
silence
can
reflect
that
are
both
probative
of
guilt
and
not
consistent
with
the
desire
to
refuse
to
answer
the
question
as
a
matter
of
right.
so,
for
instance,
the
suspect
could
want
to
answer
the
question
but
have
trouble
coming
up
with
an
exculpatory
answer.
he
could
strategically
decide
that
he
is
just
going
to
sit
silent
for
a
bit,
to
see
what
else
the
prosecution
--
or,
i'm
sorry
--
the
police
say
in
order
to
spin
it
out,
see
what
they
know.
he
could
be
dismayed
or
shocked
momentarily
because
the
question
reveals
that
the
police
have
more
evidence
than
he
thought
they
did.
so
i
think
in
all
of
those
situations,
those
--
those
mental
states
are
not
consistent
with
the
desire
to
invoke
the
privilege,
and
that's
why
petitioner's
rule
is
essentially
a
prophylactic
rule
that
would
protect
a
great
deal
of
conduct
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
desire
to
exercise
the
fifth
amendment
right.
i
think
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
that,
where
you
have
a
--
a
suspect
who
speaks
for,
you
know,
several
minutes,
you
know,
half
an
hour,
whatever,
and
he's
answering
questions
in
an
exculpatory
manner.
he's
suddenly
silent
in
response
to
one
question,
and
so
i
think
the
inference
that
could
be
drawn
there
is
that
he
was
surprised
by
the
question
and
didn't
know
how
to
answer
it
in
the
most
exculpatory
manner.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient,
yes,
to
say,
i
don't
want
to
answer
any
more
questions.
and
i
think--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to
invoke
with
respect
to
questions
on
that
topic.
and
i
think,
as
--
as
in
thompkins,
i
think
it's
important
to
have
a
clear
rule
here,
because
invocation
does
affect--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
think
it's
--
it's
an
objective
standard
and
it's
the
same
formulation
that
the
court
has
already
adopted
in
berghuis
and
in
thompkins
and
in
davis.
so
in
the
miranda
context,
the
court
has
already
faced
this
problem:
how
do
we
know
when
the
defendant
has
invoked
his
rights
and
what
should
the
standard
be?
and
it
has
said
that
it
is
an
objective
standard,
it's
what's
reasonably
perceived
as
an
invocation,
and
so
the
lower
courts
are
very
used
to
applying
that.
i
think
it's
very
administrable
because--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
i
--
i
think
there
are
a
variety
of
circumstances
in
which,
as
i
said
before,
silence
is
probative
of
guilt.
and
so
the
question
is
whether
you
want
a
broad,
prophylactic
rule
that
will
protect
a
great
deal
of
conduct
that
--
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
exercise
of
the
right.
