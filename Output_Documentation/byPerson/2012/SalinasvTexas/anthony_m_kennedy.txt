justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
--
it's
well
settled
that
when
you're
--
wherein
you're
examining
the
witness
and
he
takes
--
and
he
suddenly
says
i
don't
want
any
more
questions,
that
that's
--
he's
waived
if
you're
in
court,
if
you're
examining
a
witness
on
the
stand.
so
against
that
background,
suppose
in
this
case
the
facts
were
just
about
the
same,
and
he
said
what
--
the
police
said,
what
would
you
do
if
we
matched
the
shotgun
shells,
and
he
said
--
he
said
“
well
”
--
and
then
he
starts
to
cry.
he
said
one
word,
“
well
”,
and
he
started
to
cry.
admissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
he
said,
“
well
”?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
could
the
police
officer
also
testify
that
and
then
he
started
to
cry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
the
prosecution
could
say,
well,
he
said,
well,
and
started
to
cry,
and
he
never
told
us
anything
else.
that
--
that
final
sentence
that
i
used
is
impermissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
want
--
are
you
saying
that
before
the
miranda
warning
is
required,
you
cannot
invoke
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean
--
that's
my
--
that's
how
i
understood
that.
i
know
you're
not
arguing
that,
but
that's
why
i'm--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
it
can
be
invoked,
and
that
might
make
a
big
difference.
in
your
--
in
your
brief,
you
acknowledge
that
most
citizens
know
they
have
a
fifth
amendment
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
if
there's
--
if
questions
are
somehow
troublesome,
you
say,
i'm
invoking
my
fifth
amendment
right;
go
away,
even
if
you're
not
in
custody,
even
if
miranda
doesn't
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
client
didn't
do
that
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
--
you're
giving
us
miranda,
not
miranda,
custody,
not
custody,
gray
area.
that
--
that's
what
you're
arguing.
you
want
a
gray
area
opinion
to
be
written.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
berghuis,
we
found
no
implication.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
--
so
justice
kagan's
question
stands.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a
few,
as
i
recall.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
kagan's
earlier
question
to
the
hypothetical
of
the
defendant
that
says
nothing
for
20
questions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
there's
no
--
and
there's
no
miranda
warning
and
no
custody.
