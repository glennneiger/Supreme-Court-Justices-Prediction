well,
it
would
be
up
to
the
jury,
wouldn't
it?
the
jury
might
well
agree
with
justice
sotomayor
that
it
doesn't
prove
anything
that
he
answered
a
question,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
is
whether
you
can
ask
the
jury
to
consider
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
wouldn't
say
that.
he
would
say
one
of
the
indications
of
his
guilt
is
that
he
refused
to
answer
the
question.
no
prosecutor
would
argue
that
that
alone
would
support
a
conviction,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
line
you're
drawing,
between
his
just
not
answering
and
his
saying,
i
don't
want
to
answer?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
latter
can't
be
introduce
to
the
jury,
but
the
former
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
you
--
why
would
you
draw
that
--
that
line?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
the
mere
silence
suggest
"i
don't
want
to
talk
any
more?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
you
said
he
didn't
have
to
do
that
if
he
didn't
answer
any
questions.
didn't
you?
isn't
that
what
you
said?
