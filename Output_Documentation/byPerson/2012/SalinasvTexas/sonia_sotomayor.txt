mr.
fisher,
my
--
i
have
a
number
of
problems.
the
first
is
your
rule
would
be
seen
to
be
giving
noncustodial
defendants
more
rights
than
those
defendants
in
custody,
because
you're
arguing
that
--
i
think
--
that
a
greater
degree
of
expression
other
than
silence
would
be
needed
to
show
the
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
are
you
trying
to
equate
the
rights
that
a
defendant
has
to
custodial
and
noncustodial
with
respect
to
invocation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
--
i
have
an
easier
problem
understanding
this
argument
with
respect
--
and
i'm
going
to
ask
your
adversaries
--
with
respect
to
the
situation
in
which
someone
is
approached
by
the
police
and
said,
come
in
and
talk
to
us.
i
have
a
hard
time
understanding
how
the
refusal
to
come
talk
to
them
could
be
held
against
them.
there
i
understand
it.
but
here,
your
defendant
went
in
and
talked.
so
once
he
chose
to
do
that,
why
does
he
get
more
rights
than
berghuis
did,
who
remained
silent
for
2-1/2
hours?
the
court
wasn't
willing
to
find
that
that
was
an
invocation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
why
would
it
find
the
refusal
to
ask
one
--
answer
one
question
indicative
of
the
privilege
against
silence
--
or
the
privilege
for
silence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
would
you
deal
with
another
comment
situation
where
a
defendant
meets
up
with
the
police,
gives
a
story,
and
then
later
changes
the
story.
and
the
question
is
asked
at
trial,
you
never
volunteered
that
story
to
the
police
when
they
questioned
you.
would
that
be
silence,
to
you?
would
that
be
an
invocation
of
his
right
not
to
incriminate
himself,
or
would
you
--
would
the
prosecutor
be
barred
from
arguing
to
the
jury,
as
often
is
done,
he
chose
to
say
this
but
not
that,
so
this
is
a
made-up
story.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
though
sometimes
they
come
back
and
later
do
a
different
confession.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i'm
assuming,
now
that
i'm
thinking
about
your
argument,
you
would
argue
that
even
in
a
custodial
setting
a
prosecutor
couldn't
say,
i
asked
him
did
he
shoot
his
wife,
and
the
prosecutor
can't
argue
that
because
he
refused
to
answer
that
makes
him
guilty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
in
fact,
at
most
trials,
district
court
judges
tell
juries
the
evidence
is
not
the
unanswered
question,
it's
the
question
plus
the
answer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
guess,
as
i
understand
your
rule
--
i'm
sorry.
i'll
ask
it
on
rebuttal.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why,
counsel?
i
mean,
really
what
you're
saying
is,
merely
because
i
asked
you
the
question
and
you
choose
not
to
answer
it
makes
you
guilty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
--
no
problem.
here
you're
asking
about
the
crime
of
investigation.
but
you
could
have
asked
him,
did
you
kill
joe
blow
on
another
street,
and
if
he
had
remained
silent
you
would
be
arguing
that
proves
he
is
guilty,
i
could
introduce
that
at
trial.
and
you
would
be
arguing
it
would
be
sufficient
to
convict
him;
that
you
merely
asked
the
question
and
he
remained
silent
about
it
shows
his
guilty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
a
little
scary
to
me
that
an
unanswered
question
is
evidence
of
guilt.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
he
is
not
arguing
that
the
physical
response
is
not
admissible.
he
is
just
arguing
that
the
mere
asking
of
a
question
and
a
failure
to
answer
it,
you
can't
argue
as
a
prosecutor
that
that
shows
someone
is
guilty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
your
--
my
hypothetical
that
i
posed
earlier,
if
the
police
call
you
and
say
come
in
for
questioning
and
you
ignore
them,
is
that
an
invocation
of
the
right
to
silence
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
could
you
argue
that
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they
--
they're
arguing
what
the
legal
theory
of
guilt
is
in
that
situation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
why
is
it
--
would
it
be
admissible
that
someone
decides
--
someone
comes
in
and
they
say,
police
say
to
him
or
her
we
are
investigating
this
crime,
help
us.
they
start
asking
questions
and
it's
clear
from
the
first
question
--
there
is
a
waiver
of
miranda
and
from
the
first
question,
the
first
question
is,
did
you
kill
this
person?
the
guy
remains
silent,
they
ask
a
whole
bunch
of
other
questions
and
he
remains
silent.
has
he
invoked
his
right?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
a
prosecutor
could
go
into
the
jury
and
say
he
waived
his
miranda
rights
and
he
is
guilty
because
he
refused
to
answer
our
questions?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
does
the
compulsion
line
come
in?
your
adversary
points
out
that
under
this
scenario,
the
police
could
ask
you
questions
and
say
to
you,
you
know,
if
you
stay
quiet
in
this
question,
i'm
going
to
use
it
against
you
at
trial.
that
police
will
actually
to
that.
that
they'll
actually
come
in
and
tell
defendants
who
are
telling
the
story,
you
know,
either
answer
or
it'll
be
used
against
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
can't
you
say
that
a
call
from
a
police
officer
to
someone
who
says
come
in
and
talk,
that
that
can't
be
used
against
them
at
trial
as
--
you
gave
me
a
different
answer.
you
said
it
wasn't
probative.
but
you
didn't
say
griffin
would
protect
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
such
a
radical
position,
that
silence
is
an
admission
of
guilty.
that's
really
what
the
argument
is.
i
certainly
understand
that
speaking
can
implicate
you,
and
if
you
choose
to
speak,
clearly
whatever
you
say
can
be
used
against
you
unless
you're
in
custody
and
unless
you've
invoke
the
right
before.
but
this
is
radically
different.
we
are
--
we
are
--
you're
trying
to
say
acts
of
commission
and
omission
are
the
same,
but
statements
are
different
than
silence,
because
then
you're
making
the
person
who
is
asking
the
question
your
--
your
admission.
you
are
saying
you're
adopting
their
statement
as
true.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
not
administrable
about
telling
the
police
you
just
can't
argue
to
a
jury
that
merely
not
asking
a
question
is
guilt?
what
--
what
lacks
administrable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'll
like
to
go
back
to
what
justice
ginsburg
argued,
because
there
is
an
argument
here
that
there
wasn't
an
invocation
of
the
right,
that
by
physical
conduct,
there
was
a
statement.
would
you
have
had
a
problem
if
the
prosecutor
had
argued
at
trial,
you
know,
when
he
was
asked
about
this
testing,
he
didn't
remain
silent,
he
got
nervous.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
shows
his
guilt.
