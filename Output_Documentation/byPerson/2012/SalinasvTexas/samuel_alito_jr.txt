justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
draw
a
distinction
between
mr.
salinas's
situation
and
someone
who's
questioned
in
the
home
--
in
the
person's
home
or
on
the
street?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
if
--
what
if
the
person
--
what
if
the
person
was
totally
unknown
to
the
police,
but
called
up
the
police
and
said
they
want
--
and
wants
to
talk
to
them
for
some
purpose.
you
wouldn't
draw
a
distinction
between
that
situation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
he
wants
to
talk
to
them
and--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--he
wants
to
talk
to
them,
and
then
in
the
course
of
this
conversation,
the
same
thing
happens
that
happened
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
unless
you're
going
to
argue
that
--
that
silence
cannot
be
--
can
never
be
commented
on
in
any
noncustodial
situation,
and
i
didn't
think
you
were
willing
to
go
that
far
when
i
was
questioning
you
previously,
you're
going
to
have
the
same
kind
of
line-drawing
questions;
aren't
you?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
was
it
held?
what
was
the
nature?
who
initiated
it?
was
the
person
really
under
suspicion?
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
the
questioning?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
question
in
this
is
case
is
whether
petitioner
salinas'
fifth
amendment
right
against
compelled
self-incrimination
was
violated
when
the
prosecutor
at
his
trial
commented
on
his
failure
to
respond
to
a
police
officer's
question
during
a
voluntary
noncustodial
interview.
we
hold
that
petitioner's
right
was
not
violated.
i
filed
an
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
we
conclude
that
there
was
no
fifth
amendment
violation
in
this
case
because
petitioner
failed
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
with
limited
exceptions
that
do
not
apply
here,
our
cases
have
long
required
defendants
to
invoke
the
privilege
in
order
to
benefit
from
it.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
justice
thomas
would
not
extend
the
court's
holding
in
griffin
versus
california
to
a
defendant's
silence
during
a
pre-custodial
interview.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
sotomayor,
and
kagan
have
joined.
