isn't
the
--
isn't
the
point,
mr.
fisher--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
question
is:
what
is
it
insufficient
for?
in
berghuis,
it
was
insufficient
for
the
purpose
of
cutting
off
police
questions.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
not
the
case
here.
the
question
here
is
whether
it's
sufficient
or
insufficient
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
his
statement
--
his
silence
to
be
used
against
him
at
trial.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
an
entirely
different
question,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
just
to
nail
that
down,
because
your
first
three
words
were
“
absent
an
invocation
”.
justice
elena
kagan
are
you
now
adopting
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
because
your
brief
goes
further?
so
are
you
now
saying
that
the
crucial
thing
is
the
invocation?
justice
elena
kagan
and
so
you
would
agree
with
the
government
that
if
he
had
invoked,
that
the
fifth
amendment
right
would
come
into
play.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
curry,
in
a
case
like
berghuis,
which
is
in
a
custodial
setting,
if
the
defendant
there
had
not
ever
said
anything,
had
gone
through
the
entire
interview
and
really
never
said
a
word,
so
that
the
police
kept
asking
him
questions,
but
he
never
said
anything,
the
prosecutors
could
then
not
go
in
and
say,
look,
for
3
hours,
we
asked
him
questions
and
he
didn't
talk.
that
would
be
off
limits.
and
the
question
is,
if
that's
off
limits,
why
shouldn't
this
be
off
limits
as
well?
if
there's
no
invocation
necessary
there,
for
some
of
the
reasons
that
justice
ginsburg
was
saying,
why
should
there
be
an
invocation
requirement
here?
justice
elena
kagan
yes.
i
--
i
understand
that
in
your
case,
there
happens
to
be
a
kind
of
selective
answering
sort
of
question.
but
let's
say
--
let's
take
that
out
of
the
picture,
all
right?
and
just
say,
you
know,
he
just
didn't
want
to
answer
questions,
all
right?
so
then
the
question
is,
why
would
that
case
be
any
different
from
the
case
that
i
posited?
justice
elena
kagan
he
--
he
didn't
invoke,
he
just
didn't
answer.
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
you're
pinning
your
argument
really
on
the
fact
that
he
did
a
lot
of
answering.
justice
elena
kagan
on
this
--
on
this,
you
know,
you
can't
pick
and
choose
kind
of
argument.
justice
elena
kagan
so
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
your
argument
is,
look,
you
can't
just
like
keep
talking
and
talking
and
talking
and
--
and
at
that
point,
you
have
to
invoke?
if
--
if
you've
been
doing
a
lot
of
talking
and
then
decide
you
want
to
stay
silent,
at
that
point,
you
have
to
invoke.
but
that's
not
to
say
that
you
have
to
invoke
in
every
noncustodial
encounter.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
elena
kagan
you
took
the
words
out
of
my
mouth.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
curry,
berghuis
is
different
for
a
different
reason.
berghuis
is
different
because
the
question
in
berghuis
is
what
do
you
have
to
do
to
make
the
police
go
away.
here,
the
police
were
not
going
away.
there
was
no
--
there's
no
question
of
that.
but
the
question
is
what
do
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
bar
the
prosecutor
from
introducing
your
silence
at
trial.
so
that's
a
really
different
question,
isn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
exactly.
that's
why
berghuis
is
irrelevant
here,
because
berghuis
said
at
a
certain
point,
you
know,
you
need
to
invoke
in
order
to
stop
questioning.
but
--
but
that's
not
what's
at
issue
here.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
anders?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
sorry.
we
don't
require
invocation
at
trial,
and
we
don't
require
invocation
in
a
custodial
setting.
and
you
might
think,
well,
custodial,
that's
very
different
because,
after
all,
custodial
is
inherently
coercive,
but
that's
the
whole
point
of
miranda
warnings,
is
that
once
we
give
miranda
warnings,
that
coercion
is
dispelled
and
the
custodial
setting
essentially
becomes
like
a
noncustodial
setting.
so
if
we
don't
require
invocation
even
after
miranda
warnings
are
given
in
a
custodial
setting,
why
should
we
require
invocation
here?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
because
then
when--
justice
elena
kagan
--you're
given
the
warnings,
and
then
that's
gone.
justice
elena
kagan
what
--
what
does
that
mean?
does
he
just
--
how
about
if
he
just
said,
"you
know,
i
don't
really
want
to
answer
that
question?
"
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
anders,
suppose,
you
know,
he
thinks
that
the
interview
is
going
to
be
one
thing
and
then
it
turns
out
that
the
interview
was
something
else.
he
realizes,
it
dawns
on
him
that
the
police
really
do
see
him
as
a
suspect.
and
he
says
to
himself,
i
better
stop
answering,
right?
so
he
says,
okay
--
he's
answered
a
bunch
of
questions
already,
but
--
but
now
he's
--
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
answer
any
more
questions.
is
that
an
invocation?
justice
elena
kagan
or
if
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
answer
questions
about
a
particular
topic;
is
that
an
invocation?
justice
elena
kagan
that
doesn't
sound
like
a
clear
rule.
i
mean,
you
know,
as
--
as
between,
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
answer
those
questions
on
a
particular
topic,
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
question,
or
just
like
could
we
go
on
to
a
different
question
or
--
or
i
don't
know.
why
is
that
different?
