justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
back
up.
when
he
asked
for
a
permit,
he
voluntarily
said,
as
mitigation
for
the
loss
of
wetlands,
i
am
going
to
voluntarily
create
a
conservation
easement
on
the
rest
of
my
property.
so
he
recognized
from
day
one
that
there
had
to
be
some
mitigation
for
what
he
was
seeking
to
do
in
the
permit.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
he
had
offered
nothing
and
he
just
said,
i
want
this
permit
to
develop
my
land,
and
the
agency
said,
you
have
offered
no
mitigation,
we
deny
your
permit,
would
he
have
a
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
he
just
put
in
the
application,
no
mitigating
--
no
mitigation
of
any
kind,
and
the
agency
says
no.
you
recognize
that
he
would
have
no
claim,
right?
that
he
had
an
obligation
to
mitigate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
--
i
think
you
have
a
problem
with
that,
mr.
beard,
because
if
you
look
at
the
record,
the
record
is
very
clear
that
it
was
not
--
that
the
district
didn't
come
back
and
say,
take
it
or
leave
it,
you
--
you
improve
our
wetlands
or
you
get
no
permit.
there
was
and
if
you
--
they
are
set
out
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
pages
13
to
15,
oh,
at
least
half
a
dozen,
maybe
more,
that
the
district
said
here
are
several
ways,
several
ways
that
you
could
sufficiently
offset
the
adverse
impact.
and
some
of
them
had
nothing
to
do
with
improving
the
government's
own
land.
so
if
we
can't
--
we
really
can't
say
this
was
a
take
it
or
leave
it,
either
you
do
the
improvements
that
we
are
asking
you
to
do
or
you
get
no
permit,
what
do
you
do
with
the
fact
that
as
the
appendix
certainly
bears
out,
that
the
district
offered
a
range.
it
offered
many,
many
ways
that
this
permit
might
be
granted,
and
then
it
says,
then
you
are
free
to
come
up
with
some
other,
something
else.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
is
because
he
wouldn't
go
beyond
what
he
was
offering,
but
that's
--
some
of
these
options
--
one
was
that
he
--
that
he
adjust
the
size
of
his
project,
that
he
make
it
smaller.
the
staff
suggested
eliminating
--
no,
that's
a
different
one.
but
there
was
one
that
suggested
that
he
--
he
reduce
the
scale,
the
petitioner
reduce
the
scale
of
his
project
to
1
acre,
and
preserve
the
rest
for
the
conservation
easement.
now,
if
he
took
that,
would
you
have
any
--
any
case
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
they
said,
we
will
give
you
a
permit
if
you
reduce
the
scale
of
your
project
to
1
acre,
and
then
preserve
the
rest
by
a
conservation
easement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
record
just
doesn't
bear
that
out.
the
record
shows
that
it
wasn't
one
option.
they
gave
him
a
laundry
list
of
things
he
could
do,
some
of
them
having
nothing
whatever
to
do,
anything
off
his
own
property.
suppose
the
--
whatever
the
district
court
might
have
said,
the
record
shows
that
the
agency
said,
you're
right,
seven
things
you
could
do,
come
up
with
something
else
if
you
have
something
else.
and
some
of
them
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
other
properties.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
--
where
is
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
why
isn't
it
entirely
reasonable
to
say,
if
you
are
going
to
put
a
condition
on
a
permit,
that
condition
has
to
have
some
rough
proportionate
relationship
to
the
harm
that
is
being
done
to
the
permit
--
that
seems
to
me
permanently
sensible,
that
if
they
are
going
--
if
they
are
going
to
exact
a
condition,
the
condition
has
to
have
some
discrete
proportional
relationship
to
the
harm?
