justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i've
had
a
problem
with
your
argument,
okay?
from
the
record
it's
very
clear
that
a
conservation
offer
is
not
considered
mitigation
because
there's
still
a
net
loss
of
wetlands.
the
policy
is
abundantly
clear,
stated,
and
undisputed.
okay?
so,
given
that
policy,
why
are
we
even
in
this
case?
meaning
whether
there
was
an
exaction
or
no
exaction
or
whatever
happened
in
terms
of
the
denial,
you
couldn't
win
on
your
offer
because
the
policy
of
the
state
was
clear,
and
in
my
mind,
unassailable.
we
have
to
preserve
wetlands.
conservation
of
other
wetlands
is
not
enough.
mitigation
means
make
sure
that
we
get
a
net
gain
of
wetlands.
so
why
are
we
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
decide
whether
the
agency
has
done
that
right
or
not?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
normally
decide?
let's
assume
justice
kagan's
question
or
justice
ginsburg's
question.
no
--
it
just
says,
come
to
us
with
a
mitigation
plan.
and
you
say,
this
is
what
i
offer
and
it's
enough.
and
they
say,
no,
it's
not
enough;
denied.
would
you
go
through
the
state
administrative
process
to
figure
out
whether
that
was
arbitrary
and
capricious,
whether
it
was
a
penn
central
violation?
what
would
you
do
with
that
claim
in
the
normal
circumstance?
justice
kennedy's
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
would
be
an
inverse
condemnation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
--
how
does
that
not
address
going
too
far?
you
just
said
it.
if
--
if
this
is
unrelated
to
the
denial
of
your
permit
of
all
uses
of
your
land
and
you're
saying
that's
the
problem,
which
is
i
still
have
a
use,
i
just
want
more,
why
does
that
entitle
you
to
your
lost
profits?
when
were
you
ever
entitled
to
start
with
the
claim
that
somehow
you're
entitled
to
a
permit
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
go
back
to
the
questions
presented
for
a
moment?
the
court
below
did
two
separate
rulings,
i
think.
one
is
there
can't
be
a
taking
if
the
--
if
the
claim
is
that
it's
of
an
undifferentiated
money,
not
a
risk.
and
i
think
you
would
agree
with
that.
if
the
only
issue
is
an
obligation
to
pay
money,
that
that's
not
a
takings
claim,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
there
was
a
second
holding,
however,
which
really
gets
eclipsed
by
the
second,
which
is
a
denial
of
a
permit
doesn't
permit
you
to
raise
the
nollan-dolan
case,
and
it
appears
to
me
even
if
there
is
an
easement
situation,
so
even
if
there
is
an
actual
takings
claim
at
issue.
do
you
agree
with
that
first
holding
by
the
court
below?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assuming
we
narrow
it
not
to
undifferentiated
money,
but
is
there
a
difference
between
a
denial
or
a
grant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
we
do
with
what
mr.
kneedler
says
is
a
ruling
in
your
favor
on
this
question,
that
all
denials
are
subject
to
nollan
and
dolan?
what
do
we
do
with
that?
what's
the
--
i
see
an
enormous
flood
gate
here,
and
one
in
which
we
are
sending
a
signal
that
perhaps
states
should
be
more
quiet
rather
than
more
engaging.
they
should
just
say
no,
because
anything
they
offer
is
going
to
be
seen
as
an
--
potentially
as
an
unconstitutional
taking.
they
should
just
plain
say
no,
not
explain
why,
not
engage
in
any
work
with
you
to
mitigate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
they're
not.
people
are
asked
to
pay
taxes.
homeowners
are
asked
to
pay
taxes
all
the
time;
development
fees
if
they
want
to
develop
something.
people
are
subject
to
money
exactions
all
of
the
time
in
this
society.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
happens
in
just
--
when
the
legislature
passes
a
development
fee?
are
you
now
saying
that's
subject
to
nollan
and
dolan,
too?
