justice
antonin
scalia
for
what?
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
know
what
property
was
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
posing
a
situation
in
which
he
never
came
forward
with
any
suggestion.
they
never
came
forward
with
any
suggestion.
you
say
he
still
has
a
cause
of
action
for
a
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
taking
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
other
side
says
that
you
may
have
such
a
cause
of
action
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
the
other
side
in
this
case
acknowledge
that
you
have
such
a
cause
--
that
you
may
have
such
a
cause
of
action
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
just
saying
you
don't
have
a
cause
of
action
for
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that's
fine.
that
--
that
would
enable
you
to
challenge
the
denial
of
the
permit,
saying
it's
based
upon
an
unconstitutional
condition.
but
how
does
it
--
how
does
it
enable
you
to
say
there's
been
a
taking?
what
has
been
taken?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
hasn't
--
it
hasn't
been
taken.
i
mean,
he
turned
it
down.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
--
the
--
the
permit
was
granted
in
nollan
and
dolan.
and
--
and
the
condition
attached
to
the
permit,
therefore,
took
effect;
namely,
that
you
had
to
dedicate
this
easement
over
your
--
over
your
beach
whereas
--
as
my
colleague
pointed
out,
anybody
could
walk
back
and
forth
barefooted.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
sliced
bread's
supposed
to
be
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
would
be
subject
to
nollan
and
dolan
analysis
if
they
took
the
$10,000.
if
they
issued
the
permit,
the
developer
went
ahead
with
the
development
and
the
state
then
attached
the
bank
account
in
the
amount
of
$10,000
or
whatever,
that
would
be
nollan
--
and
nollan
and
dolan
--
in
nollan,
there
was
a
taking.
he
had
gone
ahead
with
the
--
with
the
development
of
his
house
under
the
permit
which
said
if
he
did
that,
he
gave
away
the
easement.
so
there
--
there
was
a
--
a
taking
there.
the
easement
would
have
been
taken
automatically.
in
--
in
--
in
dolan,
there
was
--
the
individual
had
not
gone
ahead
with
the
development,
but
it
was
clear
that
any
development
the
person
undertook
would
be
subject
to
the
--
the
exaction
that
the
municipality
required.
so
there
was
a
--
a
taking
there,
we
said.
here,
there's
nothing
that
happens.
the
permit
was
denied,
unlike
in
--
unlike
in
--
in
dolan
where
the
permit
was
granted
and
it
was
understood
that
if
she
went
ahead
with
it,
she
was
going
to
lose
--
lose
some
land
rights.
here,
the
permit's
been
denied.
i
can't
see
where
there's
a
taking
here.
nothing's
been
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
permit
had
issued.
the
permit
had
issued
in
both
of
those
cases,
and
therefore
the
person
was
saying:
to
go
ahead
with
this
permit
i
give
up
this
land.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
approval
with
conditions.
there's
one
thing
for
a
municipality
to
issue
an
approval
with
conditions,
and
a
municipality
saying
we
can't
approval
it
unless
you
agree
to
these
conditions.
and
the
person
doesn't
agree
and
the
municipality
says
we
don't
approve
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
raise
penn
central.
you
keep
on
running
away
from
it
by
saying
penn
central
or
lucas.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
deprive
the
land
of
all
value.
the
land
still
has
some
value.
penn
central
is
totally
out
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
your
position,
cash
is
magical,
right?
the
government
can
come
in
and
come
into
my
house,
take
all
of
the
cash
that's
there,
and
that
is
not
the
basis
for
takings
claim,
right?
because
cash
is
not
--
is
not
a
taking.
does
that
make
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
stopping
point
is
don't
take
my
cash.
your
answer
to
my
question
is:
that's
okay,
it's
not
a
taking,
right?
i
may
have
some
other
cause
of
action,
but
not
a
--
not
a
taking?
the
government's
come
in
and
taken
my
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
nollan
and
dolan.
i'm
talking
about
your
position
that
the
taking
of
cash
cannot
be
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
--
if
they
say,
you
have
to
turn
over
to
us
whatever
money
you
have
in
your
house,
or
you
have
to
turn
over
to
us
whatever's
in
your
bank
account,
that's
not
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
do
it
to
five
or
six
other
landowners,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
gee,
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
--
as
entirely
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
a
tax
that
is
imposed
only
on
landowners,
and
it's
--
you
know,
it's
a
tax
--
$5,000
per
landowner,
if
that
were
replaced
by
a
provision
that
said,
every
landowner
shall
contribute
to
the
state
a
portion
of
his
property
worth
$5,000.
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
latter
is
bad
and
the
former's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
surprises
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
justification
is
the
protection
of
wetlands.
that's
a
justification.
the
protection
of
wetlands.
there's
no
necessary
comparison,
as
nollan
and
dolan
requires,
between
the
harm
that
would
be
occasioned
if
the
permit
were
granted
and
what
the
state
is
exacting
in
order
to
mitigate.
that
doesn't
exist
anywhere
in
--
in
the
analysis
that
you
are
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that
is
a
problem.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
taken
in
nollan
and
dolan?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
nollan
and
dolan,
wasn't
the
easement
what
was
taken?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
--
wasn't
what
was
taken
unreasonably
the
ability
of
this
homeowner
to
make
the
alterations
to
his
house
that
he
wanted
to
make?
he
wanted
to
add
another
story
and
the
court
--
and
the
state
said,
you
can't
do
it.
and
its
only
basis
for
saying,
you
can't
do
it
was,
because
you
wouldn't
give
us
the
easement.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
this
unreal?
i
mean,
you
are
saying
all
along
in
the
negotiations
the
agency
says,
if
you
do
x,
you
get
the
permit.
and
x
is
--
would
--
would
be
an
unconstitutional
condition.
okay,
he
refuses
to
do
x.
the
permit
is
denied
with
a
general
statement
like
this:
the
permit
is
denied
because
he
has
refused
to
do
the
necessary
mitigation.
isn't
it
clear
that
the
reason
he's
refused
to
do
the
necessary
mitigation
is
he
has
refused
the
last
demand
of
the
agency?
