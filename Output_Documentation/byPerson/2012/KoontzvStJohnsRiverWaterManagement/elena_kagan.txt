mr.
beard,
can
i
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
first
question
and
make
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
it?
suppose
that
the
state
just
had
a
policy
that
said,
we're
concerned
about
wetlands;
in
order
to
develop
your
piece
of
property,
you
have
to
come
forward
with
a
proposal,
a
mitigation
proposal,
and
an
adequate
mitigation
proposal.
and
then
it
gives
some
guidance
about
what
an
adequate
mitigation
proposal
would
mean,
but
it
really
leaves
it
up
to
the
landowner.
and
the
landowner
says,
sorry,
i'm
not
giving
you
anything.
i
think
i
should
be
able
to
develop
this
on
my
own
without
providing
any
mitigation.
and
the
state
says,
well,
then,
sorry,
you
don't
get
a
permit.
is
that
a
taking?
does
the
man
have
a
takings
claim?
i
heard
you
answer
the
question
yes.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
the
next
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
because
my
understanding
of
nollan
and
dolan
was
that
it
assumed
the
conditions,
if
taken
alone,
would
constitute
a
taking.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
then
you
need
a
taking
someplace
in
the
picture.
isn't
that
right?
nollan-dolan
said
this
is
how
we
analyze
takings
in
the
context
of
a
permit
scheme.
so
we
have
to
look
for
a
taking.
so
in
my
example,
where
is
the
taking?
this
was
justice
ginsburg's
example.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
--
mr.
beard,
i
don't
think
anybody
is
contesting
that
there
was
a
condition
imposed
or
maybe
there
are.
but
--
you
know,
there's
another
question
whether
that
position
is
a
taking.
and
we've
been
trying
to
figure
out
what's
the
taking
here.
in
nollan
and
dolan,
they
took
an
easement,
they
took
a
piece
of
land.
so
that's
the
taking.
now,
you
said
the
funds
are
the
taking;
is
that
correct?
any
time
that
somebody
comes
up
with
a
proposal
for
--
for
a
developer
to
pay
money
in
order
to
compensate
the
state
for
the
costs
that
are
associated
with
his
development,
that
that
is
itself
a
taking?
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i
understand.
but
in
the
permit
context,
a
state
can't
say
to
somebody,
you
have
to
pay
to
perform
some
service
or
to
compensate
without
it
being
a
taking
and
without
it
being
subject
to
nollan
and
dolan
analysis.
justice
elena
kagan
so
--
so,
for
example,
and
i'll
try
to
do
this
very
quickly,
if
--
if
the
state
just
had
a
policy
for
every
acre
of
wetlands
you
fill
in,
it
costs
us
$10,000,
you
need
to
pay
$10,000,
that's
subject
to
nollan
and
dolan
analysis,
too.
