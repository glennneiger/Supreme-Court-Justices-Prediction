justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
i
think
might
be
driving
some
of
these
questions
is
the
district
court
says,
just
as
you
say,
had
koontz
offered
additional
mitigation,
the
additional,
that
would
have
cost
$10,000,
he
would
have
gotten
the
permit.
that's
what
he
said.
so
then
you
look
back
to
see
what
additional
mitigation.
and
here
we
have
in
the
record,
at
least
that
my
law
clerk
finds,
he
noted
that
they
went
to
koontz
and
they
said,
here
are
some
choices:
install
a
subsurface
stormwater
management
system
in
the
development,
i
mean
right
on
your
land;
or
reduce
the
size
to
1
acre;
or
eliminate
the
filling
of
the
slide
slope
areas;
or
replace
15
culverts
and
eliminate
a
ditch
system
somewhere
else;
or
enhance
50
acres
somewhere
else.
now,
at
that
point
--
and
then
they
said,
won't
you
negotiate
for
30
more
days,
maybe
we
can
find
some
other
things?
he
says,
no,
i'll
bring
a
lawsuit.
okay.
now,
i
absolutely
can
see
a
penn
central
claim
there.
but
the
land
--
what
you're
talking
about
is
not
some
land
somewhere
off
the
site.
we're
talking
about
his
land.
if
after
all
they
said
you
have
to
leave
all
the
coal
in
the
mine
to
hold
up
the
ceiling
--
you
know
what
i'm
referring
to?
then
they
go
too
far.
and
here,
if
we
look
at
all
these
conditions
proposed
and
said
--
you
know,
this
is
just
terrible,
they
don't
do
it
for
anybody
else,
your
client's
the
only
one,
it
bears
no
relation,
oh,
it
just
goes
too
far,
you
win
under
penn
central.
so
i
can
see
the
framework
here.
i'm
not
saying
you're
going
to
win,
but
i
got
it
clear
what
the
framework
is.
but
suddenly
you
bring
this
nollan-dolan
business
into
it
and
i
get
confused.
and
the
reason
is
because
there
was
a
different
piece
of
land
in
nollan
and
dolan.
the
piece
of
land
that
was
different
was
an
easement
in
front
of
--
and
an
easement
is
a
piece
of
property
in
nollan,
and
there
was
a
bike
path
in
dolan,
right
across
his
property.
so
i
don't
see
how
nollan
and
dolan
have
to
do
with
this.
i
see
everything
that
penn
central
has
to
do
with
it,
and
that
grows
out
of
the
nature
of
what
was
being
offered.
you
were
saying
what
they
are
offering
you
is
simply
going
too
far.
i've
got
that
conceptually.
i
ask
this
question
because
all
these
briefs
are
about
nollan
and
dolan,
and
i
don't
understand
what
they
have
to
do
with
it.
i
must
be
missing
something,
and
that's
why
i
am
asking
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
of
course,
they
are
land
claims
because
they
took
a
piece
of
land
which
everybody
assumes
--
right
in
front
of
his
house
--
and
said
you've
got
to
let
everybody
from
the
beaches
walk
back
and
forth
from
one
beach
in
the
north
to
another
one
in
the
south.
and
they
are
going
to
walk
over
your
land.
and
the
court
said
you
can't
take
his
land
unless
you
have
a
nexus
to
some
public
purpose
that
is
related
to
his
building
the
house.
i
got
it.
i
just
don't
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
of
course
you
can.
you
backed
out
too
much
coal.
that's
an
unconstitutional
condition.
it
goes
too
far,
and
there
is
a
framework
called
penn
central
which
deals
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
it's
the
same
question.
i
just
want
an
answer
to
my
question.
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
question,
i
am
assuming
enormously
in
your
favor.
i
am
assuming
that
this
set
of
conditions
is
the
worst
thing
since
sliced
bread.
[laughter]
i
think
there
--
all
right,
i'm
assuming
that
in
your
favor.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
been
proved
bad.
[laughter]
but
--
but
in
any
case,
the
--
the
--
the
point
is,
you
see,
i
assume
that
in
your
favor.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
the
conceptual
framework.
i
assume
that
in
your
favor.
i
assume
whether
they
didn't
issue
the
permit
and
would
have,
but
they
haven't
quite
or
maybe
they
have,
it
means
nothing.
now,
having
assumed
that,
it
seems
to
me
what
your
argument
is,
is
that
this
is
a
form
of
regulatory
taking
of
the
kind
that
holmes
was
talking
about,
and
that
--
that's
what
was
going
on
in
penn
central,
and
so
we
simply
look
to
see
if
it
went
too
far
or
whatever.
the
lower
courts
could
do
that.
i
got
that
part.
now
i
want
you
to
answer
the
question,
which
is,
am
i
right?
is
there
another
part,
a
different
part
to
this
case
called
the
nollan,
dolan
part
and
explain
that
to
me.
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
i
want
to
hear
what
you're
going
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
--
am
i
wrong
about
--
i
might
have
this
--
i
thought
the
framework
roughly
is
the
following:
it
is
not
the
case
that
penn
central
applies
only
where
there
is
a
physical
invasion
of
property,
or
there
is
total
destruction
of
the
value
of
the
property.
in
those
two
situations,
what
we
said
in
lucas
is
it
applies
without
case-specific
inquiry,
but
there
are
another
set
of
cases
where
penn
central
and
mcmahon
apply
with
case-specific
inquiry.
and
those
to
discover
whether
you
have
one,
you
look
into
such
things
as
whether
the
regulation
destroys
investment-backed
expectations,
and
then
you
look
to
the
nature
of
the
government
interest
and
the
relationships,
et
cetera.
that's
what
i
thought
the
framework
was.
now,
if
that's
the
framework,
then
when
the
government
says,
i
will
let
you
develop
your
land
if
and
only
if
you
give
$50,000
to
the
shriners
hospital,
you
would
say,
i
can't
develop
my
land.
and
besides,
that
significantly
interferes
with
my
investment-backed
expectations.
and
besides,
there
is
no
relation
whatsoever.
therefore,
i
win
under
the
takings
clause.
now,
i
spell
all
that
out,
because
if
i'm
wrong
about
that
framework
--
if
i
am
right
about
the
framework,
that
could
apply
to
this
case.
if
i
am
wrong
about
the
framework,
i
want
to
know
where
in
the
cases
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
if
i'm
right
about
the
framework,
that
takes
care
of
all
the
hypotheticals
you
were
asked.
in
those
cases,
there
is
a
significant
interference
with
investment-backed
expectation,
and
there's
no
justification
whatsoever,
so
the
takings
clause
applies.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
why
isn't
the
answer
yes,
it
is
applicable?
of
course
it's
applicable.
i
own
a
piece
of
land
and
they
have
significantly
interfered
with
my
investment-backed
expectation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
to
say
that
i
can't
put
a
house
on
this
because
i'm
supposed
to
pay
for
a
football
field,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
is
as
close
to
insisting
that
you
have
to
have
4,000
columns
of
coal
in
your
mine
so
that
you
can
never
use
it
as
i
can
think
of.
it's
holmes
brought
up
to
date.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
least
that
argument
would
be
made--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
winning
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree
with
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
he's
going
to
say
in
part
is,
i
guess,
i
did
a
little
numbers
from
your
brief,
the
37
million
acres
in
florida,
say
about
4
million
are
bodies
of
water,
and
say
a
third
of
them
are
built
up,
and
we
have
11
million
that
are
wetland
and
11
million
that
aren't.
that's
crude.
so
they're
saying
why
in
heaven's
name
are
we
supposed
to
--
everybody
wants
to
build,
and
why
should
the
people
that
happen
to
live
in
wetland
have
to
pay
for
all
the
other
wetland?
that's
just
coincidence.
so
he
is
going
to
say
that
that
is
like
the
shriners
hospital.
you
are
going
to
say,
no,
it
isn't
like
the
shriners
hospital.
now,
all
i'm
saying
is,
isn't
it
at
least
an
issue
under
the
takings
clause
whether
it
is
or
isn't?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you'll
say
that.
he
will
say
that
it
is.
