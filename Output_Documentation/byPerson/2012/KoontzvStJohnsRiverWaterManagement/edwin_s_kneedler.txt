mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
the
outset
that
petitioner's
argument
that
nollan
and
dolan
should
apply
in
this
context
would
--
would
constitute
a
radical
change
in
the
--
in
the
way
standard
generally
applicable
regulatory
programs
are
operated.
it
is
standard
procedure
when
someone
applies
for
a
permit
from
the
government,
it
is
the
permit
applicant's
burden
to
establish
that
he
complies
with
the
regulatory
program.
nollan
and
dolan
shift
that
burden
to
the
government.
that
has
never
been
the
case
under
regulation,
including
land
use
regulation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
what
--
if
--
if
the
permit
had
issued
and
an
easement
was
granted,
yes,
it
was
the
easement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
basis
of
the
--
the
theory
of
nollan
and
dolan,
and
the
court
made
this
clear
in
lingle
and
in
delmonte
dunes,
for
that
matter,
is
those
two
cases
apply
in
a
specific
situation
where
there
is
an
exaction
of
a
right
of
access,
an
easement
for
the
public
to
enter
the
land
as
a
condition.
and
the
reason
for
that,
the
court
explained
in
lingle,
there
are
really
two
reinforcing
points.
the
first
was
that
there
would
be
public
access,
which
is
a
permanent
physical
occupation,
which
is
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
general
penn
central
test
for
regulatory
takings.
the
other
is
that
it
was
a
per
se
taking.
it
was
per
se
that
the
government
could
not
have
acquired
that
easement
for
paying
--
without
paying
compensation;
therefore,
the
government
could
not
attach
as
a
condition
to
the
granting
of
a
permit
that
the
person
convey
something
unless
it
was
proportional.
so
the
theory
began
with
the
idea
that
the
easement
itself
would
have
been
--
the
taking
of
that
would
have
been
a
per
se
taking.
this
is
a
very
different
situation
because
the
other
way
in
which
petitioner's
theory
would
constitute
a
radical
departure
is
that
compliance
with
regulatory
programs
frequently,
maybe
almost
always,
requires
the
expenditure
of
money.
if
someone
wants
to
build
a
power
plant,
a
coal-fired
power
plant,
he's
going
to
have
to
install
a
scrubber
to
protect
the
air,
to
prevent
no
diminution
of
air
quality.
constructing
that
costs
money.
it
can't
be
that
the
requirement
to
spend
money
to
comply
with
a
regulatory
program
is
itself
a
taking.
the
taking
would
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
in
that
situation
there
would
be
a
very
substantial
equal
protection
challenge
because
one
landowner
is
being
singled
out
with
no
rational
basis.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
--
it
applies
when
there
is
an
identifiable
property
taken--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
right,
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
certainly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--certainly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--certainly
a
penn
central
argument
could
be
made
there,
but
i
think
that's
very
different
from
a
nollan
argument--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--which
--
which
imposes
the
--
the
burden
on
the
government
and
basically
treats
the
payment
of
money
as
itself
a
taking.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
and
this
is
not
even
an
obligation
to
pay
money.
it's
an
obligation
to
spend
money
to
come
into
compliance.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
if
the
--
if
the
agency
decision
is
written
where
there
is
an
express
condition,
we
don't
think
that
it
matters
--
an
express
condition
satisfying
nollan
and
dolan;
in
other
words,
an
exaction,
a
per
se
taking,
we
don't
think
it
matters
whether
the
--
whether
it's
a
permit
grant
or
permit
denial.
there
was
no
actual
taking
in
the
sense
that
compensation
would
be
owed,
but
it
could
be
challenged
as
an
unconstitutional
condition
under
the
nollan
and
dolan
analysis.
but
we
think
it's
critical
when
thinking
about
that
that
the
permit
denial
--
that
only
applies
if
the
permit
denial
expressly
is
based
on
the
condition,
because
otherwise
you
would
get
into
a
situation
of
negotiations
and
what
was
discussed
and
liability
could
turn
on
an
exchange
of
ideas,
whereas
it
should
turn
on
the
formality
of
the
agency's
final
decision.
it's
akin
to
the
williamson
county
final
decision
requirements.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
if
you
look
at
the
orders
denying
the
permit
applications
in
the
record
at,
i
believe
it's
49
to
51
and
59
to
61.
in
those
situations
it
says
the
permits
were
denied
because
the
plaintiff
did
not
give
the
reasonable
assurances
that
the
statute
requires
in
order
to
get
the
permit,
the
reasonable
assurances
of
no
loss
of
wetlands
functions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
the
ultimate
standard
under
the
statute
is
whether
he
has
provided
reasonable
assurances.
what
assurances
--
the
way
in
which
he
goes
about
it,
whether
offsite
or
onsite
--
the
offsite
part
just
arises
because
this
is
a
wetlands
case.
normal
regulation
wouldn't
raise
the
offsite
--
onsite
problem.
but
the
ultimate
question
is
he
didn't
carry
his
burden
of
establishing
no
net
loss
of
wetlands.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it's
clearly
not
like
the
shriners
hospital--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
i
did
want
to
come
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
the
permit
denials,
just
general
permit
denials,
the
court
made
clear
in
del
monte
dunes
are
not
covered
by
nollan
and
dolan.
they
are
covered
by
penn
central.
and
the
court
made
clear
in
nollan
that
the
court
could
have
denied
the
permit
without
attaching
the
condition.
we
think
it's
important
that
the
agency
always
have
that
option.
and
the
third
point
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
don't
think
so
because
--
because
there
are
situations
in
which
an
agency
actually
wants
to
get
the
easement.
but
this
court,
in
lingle,
made
clear
that
the
general
rule
is
penn
central
with
only
the
two
exceptions
for
regulatory--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
may
i
answer,
because
the
agency
has
to
reserve,
has
to
have
the
ability
to
deny
the
permit
because
the
conditions
required
by
the
statute
were
not
met,
and
nollan
and
dolan
deal
with
formality
and
the
formality
of
conveyance
of
an
easement.
if
there
is
not
a
document
that
requires
that,
then
the
strict
requirements
for
the
narrow
exception
for
nollan
and
dolan
do
not
apply.
