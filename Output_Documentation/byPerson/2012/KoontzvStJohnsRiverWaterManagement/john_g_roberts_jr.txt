we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
11-1447,
koontz
v.
st.
johns
river
water
management
district.
mr.
beard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
i
will
afford
you
some
additional
time
since
our
questioning
intruded
on
yours.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
wolfson?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
it
make
any
difference
in
his
refusing
to
do
anything
more
whether
the
condition
is
onsite
or
offsite?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
state
law
provisions
you
are
talking
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
is
there
anything
in
the
federal
constitution
that
limits
the
conditions
that
you
can
demand?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
is
no,
there
is
no
restraint
on
the
agency.
it
can
ask
for
the
moon
--
before
it
will
give
a
permit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
the
government
has
lost
a
penn
central
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
may
we
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
happen
very
often.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
nail
it
down,
your
position
is
that
there
is
no
limit
in
the
federal
constitution
on
what
the
agency
can
demand
as
a
condition
for
the
issuance
of
a
permit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
takings
clause
does
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure
it
would
have
been.
sure
it
would
have
been
if
they
just
went
along
--
to
a
landowner
and
the
landowner
is
there
minding
his
own
business
and
they
say,
well,
you
own
some
property,
so
give
us
a
1
million
dollars
to
build
a
football
stadium.
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
of
the
things
the
federal
provision,
the
takings
clause,
is
designed
to
prevent
property
owners
from
having
to
bear
the
costs
that
should
be
borne
by
the
people
as
a
whole.
the
football
stadium
example.
there
is
no
reason
that
a
particular
landowner
should
have
to
pay
for
the
football
stadium
simply
because
he
owns
property.
the
takings
clause
was
designed
to
make
sure
that
those
exactions
are
not
imposed
on
property
owners
but
spread
more
evenly
across
the
citizens
who
benefit
from
it.
and
i
guess
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that
the
takings
clause
is
the
one
provision
that
doesn't
apply
in
that
type
of
situation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
generally
applicable
regulation
in
the
football
stadium
hypothetical
is
not
generally
applicable.
it
says,
you
are
the
owner
of
this
property,
and
if
you
want
to
develop
it,
you've
got
to
build
a
football
stadium.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that
your
point
goes
to
the
question
that
has
been
raised
about
--
there's
no
permit
issued.
he
didn't
accept
the
permit.
and
i
don't
understand
that
proposition.
are
you
saying
that
if
you
are
confronted
with
an
unconstitutional
condition,
you
have
to
accept
it,
and
then
you
can
challenge
it?
you
can't
simply
say
you
denied
that
on
the
basis
of
an
unconstitutional
condition,
and
that's
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
federal.
you
often
fall
back
to
the
state
provisions.
i'm
looking
at
the
federal
constitution,
and
assuming
the
state
provisions
give
you
no
relief,
is
it
your
position
that
he
has
no
claim
unless
he
accepts
a
permit
with
unconstitutional
conditions?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
kneedler?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
the
football
stadium?
do
they
--
can
you
pick
a
particular
landowner?
i
mean,
you
took
a
case
in
which
there
is
no
question
under
nollan
and
dolan
about
the
relationship,
proportionality,
and
nexus.
let's
put
those
to
one
side
because
the
issue
is
whether
nollan
and
dolan
apply.
can
the
government
say,
okay,
you
want
a
permit,
we
will
give
you
the
permit
if
you
fund
the
new
football
stadium?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
one
constitutional
provision
that
is
concerned
with
protecting
property
owners
from
having
to
bear
burdens
that
should
be
borne
by
the
public
at
large
is
not
applicable?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
--
your
friend
on
the
other
side
cited
a
number
of
places
in
the
record
where
he
thought
your
condition
was
satisfied,
that
the
denial
of
the
permit
was
expressly
based
on
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
offered
conditions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
beard,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
case
is
now
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
