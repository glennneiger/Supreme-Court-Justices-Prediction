justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
district
did
have,
as
i
think
it
did
here,
a
uniform
policy
that
for
every
acre
you
develop,
you
have
to
preserve
10
wetlands,
10
acres
of
wetlands.
and
then
two
cases,
both
hypothetical.
one
is
somebody
had
an
100-acre
parcel
and
they
want
to
develop
5
acres,
and
they
have
50
acres
that
they
mitigate
for
wetlands.
the
other
person
has
only
1
acre
and
he
wants
to
--
and
he
has
to
develop
the
whole
acre.
can
the
district
then
say,
we'll
give
you
the
1-acre
development
permit
if
you
reclaim
wetlands
on
10
other
acres
that
you
--
that
we
can
designate
for
you
elsewhere?
the
hypothetical
being
designed
to
point
out
whether
or
not
the
crux
of
your
argument
is
that
he
had
to
go
off
offsite.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
my
hypothetical
you
would
--
would
there
be
a
violation
in
my
hypothetical
as
you
understood
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
have
one
question.
i
know
you
are
running
short
on
your
rebuttal
time.
assume
that
when
we
look
at
this
record,
assume
we
think
there
is
a
due
process
violation,
not
a
taking
violation.
that
is
not
before
us
here,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
--
suppose
the
agency
said,
we
are
really
short
of
revenue;
we
will
let
you
develop
your
land
if
you
contribute
a
million
dollars
to
our
new
football
stadium.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
--
let's
put
--
let's
put
it
this
way.
i
take
it
it's
a
given
that
the
government
cannot
take
an
easement
on
your
property.
it
cannot
use
your
property
for
its
own
purposes.
it
cannot
park
its
trucks
there.
it
cannot
cut
the
grass.
why
is
it
that
if
it
can't
do
those,
it
can
still
force
you,
as
a
condition
to
using
your
property
to
its
highest
and
best
use,
to
pay
them
money?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
isn't
that
an
equal
burden
--
why
isn't
that
an
equal
use
of
the
property
by
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
penn
coal
v.
mahon,
the
government
didn't
enter
the
property.
it
didn't
take
the
property
in
the
physical
sense
of
moving
in
and
appropriate
it.
it
just
says,
congratulations,
you
have
some
coal
under
your
land,
and
we
hope
you
enjoy
it
because
you
can't
move
it.
and
we
said
that
is
a
taking;
that
is
a
regulation
that
goes
too
far,
and
it
deprived,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
the
owner
of
investment-backed
expectations,
although
that
word
wasn't
in
that
penn-mahon.
