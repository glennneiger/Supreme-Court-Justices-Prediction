justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
left
of
nollan
and
dolan
if
we
agree
with
you.
let
me
give
you
three
situations.
first,
the
petition
--
the
district
says,
we
are
granting
your
permit
on
the
condition
that
you
give
us
one-third
of
your
land.
that's
nollan
and
dolan,
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
situation
number
2:
permit
is
denied,
but
it
will
be
granted
if
you
give
us
one-third
of
your
land.
what
about
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
that
the
same
as
the
first
example
for
purposes
of
nollan
and
dolan?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
i
want
to
get
to
my
third.
the
permit
is
denied
but
it
will
be
granted
if
you
give
us
the
fair
market
value
of
the
third
of
the
land,
and
once
you
have
done
that
then
we're
going
to
condemn
your
land
and
pay
you
the
fair
market
value
for
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
made
the
reference
--
you
are
making
nollan
and
dolan
a
trap
only
for
really
stupid
districts
--
you
know.
they
--
they
say
the
right
words
and
then
they
are
out
from
under
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
shouldn't
matter
whether
the
--
whether
the
permitting
authority
says
expressly
in
the
denial,
"it's
denied
because
you
didn't
do
this.
"
or
it
just
says,
it's
denied,
but
it's
perfectly
well
understood
what
was
needed,
what
they
were
going
to
demand
in
order
to
get.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
first
case
is
koontz
versus
saint
johns
river
water
management
district,
no.
11-1447.
this
case
involves
two
of
our
important
land-use
precedents,
nollan
versus
california
coastal
commission
and
dolan
versus
city
of
tigard.
those
cases
held
that
a
unit
of
local
government
may
demand
property
as
a
condition
of
its
approval
of
a
land-use
permit
only
if
the
demand
has
a
nexus
with
and
is
roughly
proportional
to
the
public
arms
that
the
proposed
land-use
would
cause.
those
cases
thus
served
to
place
at
least
some
limits
on
the
ability
of
local
authorities
to
abuse
their
power.
in
this
case,
petitioner
coy
koontz
applied
to
the
saint
johns
river
water
management
district
for
a
permit
to
build
on
land
he
owned
east
of
orlando,
florida.
the
district
denied
the
application
telling
mr.
koontz
that
it
would
approve
the
application
only
if
he
agreed
to
pay
for
improvements
to
state-owned
property
several
miles
away.
mr.
koontz
refused
and
instead
sued
in
state
court
alleging
that
the
district's
demand
ran
afoul
of
our
decisions
in
nollan
and
dolan.
the
trial
court
applied
those
precedents
and
ruled
for
mr.
koontz,
but
the
florida
supreme
court
reversed
finding
nollan
and
dolan
distinguishable
on
two
grounds.
today,
we
reject
both
of
those
rationales
and
therefore
reverse.
first,
the
florida
supreme
court
thought
that
it
made
a
difference
whether
a
local
authority
says,
“your
permit
is
granted
on
the
condition
that
you
give
us
your
property,”
as
suppose
to
saying,
“your
permit
is
denied
because
you
refused
to
give
us
your
property.”
we
hold
that
nollan
and
dolan
cannot
be
so
easily
circumvented.
they
are
special
applications
of
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
which
forbids
the
government
from
coercing
someone
into
giving
up
a
constitutional
right.
we
have
repeatedly
held
that
this
doctrine
applies
with
equal
force,
regardless
of
whether
the
government
phrases
its
demand
as
a
condition
precedent
or
a
condition
subsequent
to
obtaining
a
governmental
benefit.
under
that,
well-settled
principle,
nollan
and
dolan
apply,
regardless
of
whether
permitting
officials
used
the
words
“only,
if,
or,
not,
unless.”
second
and
for
similar
reasons,
we
hold
that
the
state
supreme
court
should
have
applied
nollan
and
dolan
even
though
respondents
demand
was
for
money
rather
than
a
tangible
interest
in
real
property.
demands
for
money
in
the
land
use
permitting
context
implicate
the
central
concern
of
nollan
and
dolan
that
the
government
may
abuse
its
broad
discretion
to
regulate
land
use
to
extort
property
that
the
takings
clause
would
otherwise
require
it
to
pay
for.
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
not
much
difference
between
a
demand
that
a
landowner
give
up
a
certain
portion
of
its
property
and
a
demand
that
the
landowner
pay
the
value
of
the
property
in
question,
which
of
course
would
allow
the
land
use
authority
than
to
turn
around
if
it
has
the
eminent
domain
power,
condemn
the
land
and
acquire
the
land
in
that
way.
again,
nollan
and
dolan
cannot
be
so
easily
circumvented.
despite
respondent's
argument
to
the
contrary,
this
case
does
not
implicate
eastern
enterprises
versus
apfel
in
which
five
justices
took
the
position
that
a
governmental
demand
for
money
from
an
unspecified
source
cannot
give
rise
to
a
taking.
unlike
the
demand
at
issue
in
that
case,
here,
the
district's
demand
burdened
the
ownership
of
a
specific
parcel
of
real
property.
the
judgment
of
the
florida
supreme
court
is
reversed.
justice
kagan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
breyer,
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
