mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
parties
agree
that
florida
may
require
a
landowner
to
perform
mitigation
as
a
condition
for
a
permit
that
would
allow
the
destruction
of
a
wetlands.
the
parties
disagreed
as
to
how
much
mitigation
was
appropriate
in
this
case.
the
district
thought
that
mr.
koontz's
proposal
was
insufficient
to
mitigate
the
damage
to
wetlands.
mr.
koontz
rejected
the
district's
counterproposals
and
he
refused
to
do
anything
more.
and
the
district
denied
his
permit
application
because
he
refused
to
do
anything
more.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean,
the
--
under
the
florida
regulatory
regime,
we
cannot
demand
certain
conditions
from
the
landowner.
the
--
we
are
obligated
--
if
the
--
if
the
permit
--
the
landowner
has
to
establish
under
his
permit
application,
and
it's
his
burden,
that
he
meets
the
various
standards,
the
public
interest
standard
which
includes
no
adverse
impact--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--correct.
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
--
not
--
not
--
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
question
is,
when
you
are
talking
about
what
analytical
rubric
you
should
apply,
whether
it
be
nollan
or
dolan
or
penn
central,
i
think
you
can
always
argue
that
the
impact
of
any
of
the
conditions
that
we
would
demand
--
and
i
will
assume
here
that
they
are
true
demands
--
you
can
always
argue
that
the
impact
of
the
conditions,
be
they
onsite,
offsite,
or
monetary,
would
be
so
burdensome
that
it
would
called
into
play
penn
central
or--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
don't
--
i
think
that
penn
--
first
of
all,
i
think
there
are
many
restraints
on
the
agency.
first
of
all,
i
think
penn
central
imposes
a
restraint
on
the
agency.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
there
are
several
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
mean,
hodel
v.
irving
is
a
penn
central
case,
i
believe,
and
i
think
kaiser-aetna
was
also
a
penn
central
case.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it
does
--
it
certainly
doesn't--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
it
is
--
certainly
the
burden
is
on
the
landowner.
but
i
think
that
penn
central,
i
think
in
lingle
when
this
court
tried
to
sort
of
restore
some
coherence
to
the
takings
jurisprudence
and
repudiated
the
agins
point,
the
court
pointed
out
that
they
--
that
the
normal
--
sort
of
the
normal
jurisprudence
is
that
the
government
is
not
required
to
establish
by
a
heightened
scrutiny
sort
of
that
there
is
a
connection
between
means-ends
analysis
when
it
engages
in
economic
regulation.
and
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
no,
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
our
position.
first
of
all,
the
due
process
clause
may
certainly
impose
conditions.
the
equal
protection
clause
may
certainly
impose
conditions.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
if
the
conditions
are
so
onerous
that
it
would
make
it
essentially
impossible
to
derive
any
value
from
the
land,
that
may
very
well
call
into
question
penn
central
or
lucas.
i
mean,
in
many
ways
this
case
could
have
been
litigated
as
a
very
straightforward
penn
central
case.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
that
may
very
well
raise
a
penn
central
or
lucas
claim.
it
also
sounds
like--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
it's
not--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it's
not
a
nollan
or
dolan
claim
is
my
point,
justice
kennedy,
and
it's
not
a
nollan
or
dolan
claim
because
it's
not
a
--
the,
as
my
friend
acknowledged,
the
question
in
nollan
and
dolan
or
the
rationale
of
nollan
and
dolan
is
would
the
condition
by
itself,
if
demanded
unilaterally
and
outside
the
permitting
context,
would
that
have
been
a
taking
of
property
for
which
just
compensation
would
have
been
required.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
would
--
i
mean
i
think
that
would
violate,
could
well
violate
the
due
process
clause.
it's
hard
to
see
what
the
rationality
of
it
is.
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
extended
the
concept
of
a
taking
to
requirements
that
a
landowner,
that
anybody
or
a
landowner,
either
pay
money
or,
more
importantly
because
i
think
what
really
is
this
case,
is
come
into
compliance
with
a
regulatory
requirement
that
would
have
--
which
he
would
have
to
expend
money
to
comply
with.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
in
that
situation,
in
other
words,
if
the
situation
is
really
exactly
the
same
like
nollan
and
dolan,
but
the
permit
is
denied
but
it's
clear
that
it
is
a
concrete
--
concrete
condition,
the
landowner
can
go
up
through
the
judicial
review
process
and
say,
this
is
--
you
know,
the
denial
of
the
permit
application
is
predicated
on
an
unconstitutional
condition,
and
you
should
set
that
aside.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
almost.
almost,
justice
alito.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
alito,
i
think
that
this
court's
decision,
this
court
decision
in
village
of
norwood,
essentially
says
if
what
is
going
on
is
just
a
pure
contrivance
to
avoid
the
requirement
of
compensation
in
the
just
compensation
clause,
that
the
court
has
said,
no,
it
will
look
through
to
the
substance
of
the
demand
and
determine
that
there
was
--
you
know,
essentially
an
evasion
of
the
just
compensation
requirement.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
first
of
all,
justice
scalia,
of
course
this
case
we
don't
believe
involves
cash.
it
involves
a
requirement
to
do
something
that
costs
money,
which
is
different
than
cash.
cash
is
--
the
problem
with
extending
--
the
problem
with
extending
the
takings
concept
to
a
monetary
obligation
which
can
be
paid
for
out
of
sort
of
undifferentiated
funds--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--is
that
it
has
no
logical
stopping
point.
i
mean,
the
court--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
nollan
and
dolan
claim
for
the
government
to
say
if
you
want--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
if
a
--
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
if
the
government
is
seizing
the
identifiable
dollar
bills
that
are
in
your
house,
i
mean
that
sounds
more
like
a
case
like--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--webb's
fabulous
pharmacies,
where--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--justice
scalia,
i
think
there
are
many
--
there
are
many
constitutional
claims
that
could
be
made.
and
i
also
want
to
add,
there
is
an
extensive
overlay
of
state
law
in
this
area
that
protects
landowners
from
arbitrary,
irrational,
intrusive,
excessive
demands
by
government
agencies.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
the
armstrong
policy
of
the
--
that
the
government
--
that
an
individual
person
should
not
be
forced
to
bear
what
society
should
--
what
should
be
spread
to
society
as
a
whole
--
is
not
violated
when
the
government
insists
that
a
landowner
comply
with
a
generally
applicable
regulation.
now,
of
course--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
think
that
is
saying
to
one
particular
landowner,
you
may
have
to
build
a
football
stadium
where
no
other
type
of
similar
regulation
or
requirement
would
ever
be
imposed
on
any
other
landowner
sounds
--
you
know,
like
--
you
know,
sounds
like
an
equal
protection
claim
if
the
government
just
picks
out
one
landowner.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
then,
justice
scalia,
i
think
you
have
to
ask
what
--
what
regulatory
scheme
is
the
government--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
for
several
reasons,
justice
kennedy.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
this
nation
has
a
long
legal
tradition
of
giving
unique
legal
protection
to
property
as
opposed
to
money.
i
mean,
there
are
many
circumstances
--
many
circumstances
--
where
the
government
can
say
to
an
individual,
you
must
give
me
$1,000,
but
cannot
say
--
or
a
group
of
individuals
--
but
cannot
say
to
the
same
group
or
individual,
you
must
give
me
land
worth
$1,000.
i
mean,
there
--
that
is
what
the
just
compensation
clause--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
government
obviously--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
would--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
would
raise
very
serious
questions.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
this
court
has
ever
--
has
ever
been
faced
with
exactly
such
a
case,
but
i
think
that
would
raise
a
very
serious
question.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
breyer,
we
think
that
you
are
right
about
that
framework.
that
--
and
just
6
weeks
ago
in
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
just
6
weeks
ago,
in
the
arkansas
fish
and
game
commission
case,
this
court
reiterated
that
penn
central
is
presumed
to
be
the
test.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
we
agree,
justice
scalia,
and
we
don't--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
justice
scalia,
there
are
--
there
is
another
problem
with
the
nollan
and
dolan
claim
in
this
case,
which
is,
it's
hard
to
see
how
you
can
have
an
exactions
takings
claim
when
nothing
has
ever
actually
been
exacted.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
and
so
--
and
in
this
case,
if
the
--
if
the
claim
for
the
taking
--
for
the
compensation
is
based
on
nollan
and
dolan,
it
seems
that
there
is
a
mismatch,
and
that
what
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
do
is
sort
of
take
the
nollan-dolan
heightened
scrutiny
government
bears
the
burden
of
proof
analysis
and
sort
of
convert
that
into
what
is
the
regulatory
takings
analysis
for
the
entire
parcel
of
his
land,
which
is
--
which
is
the
measure
of
damages
that
he
received.
so
i
think
that
there
is
the
mismatch.
and
now,
this
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
that's
not
our
argument,
mr.
chief
justice.
florida
has
opened
an
avenue
for
judicial
relief
for
you
to
go
up
through
the
florida
epa
process
just
like
the
federal
epa,
where
you
can
say,
stop
--
stop
the
district
from
doing
this
to
me;
they
are
predicating
their
--
either
their
grant
or--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--if
there
is
no
--
if
there's
no
claimed
avenue
as
i
was
saying,
then
i
would
think
we
would
then
--
you
would
have
to
obtain
--
you
have
to
seek
compensation,
but
your
compensation
is
for
the
value
of
your
land
that
was
taken.
and
in
lingle,
this
court
reiterated
that
the
takings
clause
is
not
a
substantive
limitation
on
the
government's
power
to
regulate.
the
takings
clause
--
or
as
i
should
call
it,
the
just
compensation
clause
--
is
a
requirement
that
if
--
that
the
government
will
pay
you
just
compensation
for
any
property
or
property
interest
it
has
seized
from
you.
it
does
not
--
it
does
not
itself
impose
a
--
a
requirement
that
the
government
substantively
justify
its
regulation.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
the
district
thought
that
they
were
acting
roughly
proportional.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
government
shouldn't
act
--
that
government
should
not
act
reasonably.
but
i
think
when
you
force
these
cases
into
court
under
the
nollan,
dolan
framework,
you
have
a
--
you
have
basically
a
mismatched
and
extraordinarily
complex
situation,
and
you
have
--
you
run
right
into
what
this
court
said
in
lingle,
which
is
that
it
is
not
ordinarily
the
court's
jurisdiction
--
the
appropriate
approach
to
require
the
government
to
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
correct.
and,
justice
kennedy,
nobody
is
disputing
that
mr.
koontz
could
have
made
the
argument
that
the
regulation
goes
too
far
in
the
sense
of
the
burden
on
his
proposed
project.
i
mean,
he
had
all
of
those
arguments
available
to
him.
he
bought
the
--
he
says
he
bought
the
land
before
the
regulation
went
into
effect.
he
had
investment-backed
expectations
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
but
that
is
not
the
claim
that
he
is
advancing
to
this
court.
thank
you.
