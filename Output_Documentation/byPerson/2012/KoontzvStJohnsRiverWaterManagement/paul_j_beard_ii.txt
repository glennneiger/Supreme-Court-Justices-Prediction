mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
extent
to
which
nollan
and
dolan
review
should
be
made
available
to
individuals
to
challenge
excessive
exactions
imposed
as
conditions
to
land
use
approval.
here,
before
he
could
make
small
use
of
his
property,
coy
koontz
was
told
by
the
district
that
he
had
to
finance
enhancements
to
50
acres
of
publicly
held--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--that
is
correct.
with
his
application,
justice
ginsburg,
he
did
offer
a
mitigation
in
the
form
of
a
conservation
easement
on
most
of
his
property.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
if
there
was
no
condition
attached
to
the
permit
denial,
then
there
would
be
no
claim;
although
it
would
be
up
to
the
district,
under
nollan
and
dolan,
to
make
the
individualized
determination,
both
of
the
amount
of
impact
to
wetlands
and
the
amount
necessary
to
offset.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
it
depends,
your
honor.
if
the
denial
was
based
on
the
idea
that
he
was
obligated
to
offer
mitigation,
and
that
was
the
extent
of
the
district's
communication
with
him
--
in
other
words,
that
the
district
told
him,
you
must
offer
us
something,
we
won't
tell
you
what
and
we'll
let
you
decide
what
you
want
to
offer
in
mitigation
--
if
that
was
in
the
record,
and
that
was
the
--
and
the
result
of
that
was
a
permit
denial
because
mr.
koontz
said,
for
example,
well,
gee
whiz,
i
don't
know
how
much
i
need
to
mitigate
for,
you
haven't
told
me,
i
still
believe
there
would
be
a
dolan
violation
because
in
dolan
the
court
made
clear,
there
has
to
be
an
individualized
determination--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--he
wouldn't
know
where--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--not
for--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--not
for
a
taking,
your
honor,
but
he
--
he
may
have
a
cause
of
action
under
nollan
and
dolan
for
the
imposition
of
an
unconstitutional
condition
that
may
not
--
the
contours
of
which
may
not
be
known.
but
the
fact
that
the
district
told
him,
you
need
to--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--excuse
me,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
--
well,
their
argument--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--that
is
correct.
they
are
saying
that
we
don't
have
a
cause
of
action
for
a
taking.
of
course,
in
nollan
and
dolan,
there
was
no
transfer
of
property
from
the
applicant
to
the
relevant
agencies.
as
this
court
will
recall
in
both
nollan
and
dolan,
there
was
an
imposition
of
an
exaction
and
immediately
the
applicant
in
both
cases
sued
to
prevent
the
unlawful
exaction
from
being
consummated.
so--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--justice
sotomayor,
we
don't
contest
the
legitimacy
of
the
policy,
of
course,
in
preserving
wetlands;
nor
do
we
contest,
for
that
matter,
the
ratios
that
the
district
has
imposed
via
its
regulations.
it
is
undisputed,
the
trial
court
found
below
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
the
finding
was
undisturbed
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
that
in
fact
the
offsite
mitigation,
that
part
of
the
mitigation
that
went
beyond
the
conservation
easement,
was
in
excess;
it
violated
nollan
and
dolan.
so
the
underlying
factual
findings
are
not
in
dispute.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
justice
ginsburg,
it's
true
that
there
were
negotiations
and
that
a
range
of
offers
were
made.
on
mr.
koontz's
application
to
use
3.7
acres
of
his
property
in
conjunction
with
the
conservation
easement,
the
district
made
a
final
decision
denying
him
his
permit
because
he
would
not
go
beyond
the
easement
and
offer
offsite
mitigation.
and
that
is--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg?
if
we
took--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--unlikely
not,
your
honor,
because
the
trial
court
did
conclude
based
on
the
evidence
that
he
was
having
minimal
impact
on
any
viable
wetlands.
and
so
even
a
reduction
in
the
size
of
the
project
with
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
mitigation
would
have
a
fortiori
gone
beyond
even
what
we
have
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
made
clear
as
a
matter
of
law
that
mr.
koontz
was
entitled
to
a
determination
on
the
application
he
submitted.
he
submitted
that
application
and,
as
the
district
admitted
in
a
pretrial
statement
right
before
trial,
the
denials
were
based
exclusively
--
and
this
is
a
quote
--
"the
denials
were
based
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
would
not
provide
additional
mitigation
to
offset
impacts
from
the
proposed
project.
"
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
my
answer
was
that
he
may
have
a
nollan-dolan
claim.
i
don't
want
to
get
confused
about
the
term
taking,
because
taking
could
imply
many
types
of
regulatory
takings
claims.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
i
do
not
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
right.
and
i
think
that's
correct,
that
under
nollan
and
dolan
you
would
have
to
have
a
condition
that
was
imposed
on
you.
my
only
point
was
would
it
be
lawful,
would
it
be
a
problem
in
the
district
shifting
its
burden
on
to
the
applicant
and
saying:
we're
not
going
to
establish
what
mitigation
is
required;
we're
not
going
to
establish
what
the
impacts
are;
we'll
leave
that
up
to
you;
you
give
us
what
you
think
is
necessary.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
the
crux
is
not
that
he
had
to
go
offsite,
but
that
--
that
did
play
into
the
trial
court's
analysis
as
to
the
connection
between
his
impact
and
what
was
being
required.
and
there
was
testimony
below
that
there
was
no
connection
there.
and
the
fact
that
the
mitigation
was
4
to
7
miles
away
played
into
the
analysis
as
to
whether
there
was
a
connection.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
it
depends,
your
honor,
because
you
have
to
determine
what
in
each
respective
hypothetical,
what
the
impact
was
actually
to
the
wetlands,
and
then
determine
what
the
appropriate
mitigation--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--excuse
me?
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
in
the
normal
circumstance,
if
there
was
no
condition
imposed,
there
would
not
be
a
nollan
and
dolan
claim.
there
may
be
another
kind
of
claim,
say,
under
penn
central.
and
that
could
be
brought.
that
wouldn't
have
to
be
brought
via
administrative
remedies
if
there
was
a
final
agency
action.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
correct.
it
could
be
an
inverse
condemnation
type
of
a
claim.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
justice
breyer,
nollan
and
dolan
fundamentally
are
about
whether
a
property
owner
has
been
singled
out
to
bear
public
burdens.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
because
you
can
have
an
unconstitutional
condition
imposed
on
your
right
to
do
something,
in
this
case
make
use
of
your
property.
and
the--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--penn
central
is
a
special
takings
case
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
a
regulation
of
the
use
of
property
that
is
sought
to
be
developed
has
gone
too
far
so
as
to
affect
the
taking.
penn
central
is
not--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--we're
entitled
under
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
to
not
have
to
bear
a
public
burden
that
has
no
bearing
on
the
impact
that
we're
trying
to
use
on
our
property.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
what
has
been
--
what
has
been
taken
in
effect
is
his
funds
that
have
to
be
put
now
to
a
public
use,
the
enhancement
of
50
acres
of
public
wetlands.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
takings
clause,
nothing--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--nothing
was
taken
in
nollan
and
dolan,
either.
what
was
proposed
there,
though,
was
a
threat
of
a
taking.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
justice
scalia,
in
nollan
and
dolan,
there
was
approval
--
approval
with
conditions.
there
were
no
permits
issued,
and
that's
--
that
is
an
important
distinction
to
make
that
most
agencies,
including
this
one,
you
approve
a
permit
with
a
--
with
conditions,
which
means,
we
will
give
you
your
permits
as
soon
as
you
comply;
which
is
substantively
the
same
as
saying,
we
won't
give
you
your
permits
until
you
say
yes
to
our
conditions.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
justice
breyer,
there
is
another
part,
a
very
distinct
part,
and
that
part
goes
to
the
question
of
the
condition
that
produced
the
denial.
so
there
are
--
there
are
actually
two
parts
here.
there's
the
conditioning
of
your
permit.
in
other
words,
we
will
not
issue
you
permits
unless
you
agree
to
perform
offsite
mitigation.
now,
the
question
under
nollan
and
dolan
is,
was
that
condition
constitutional?
was
he
asked
to
give
up
something
that
the
state
or
the
district
in
this
case
should
not
have
asked
him
to
give
up
in
exchange
for
his
right
to
use
his
property?
now,
it's
true
as
--
as,
justice
breyer,
you
mentioned,
that
the
permit
denial
and
whether
that
affects
a
regulatory
taking
of
his
land,
of
the
thing
he
wants
to
use,
that's
an
entirely
different
question,
and
it
may
raise
another
kind
of
claim,
another
kind
of
taking
claim.
but
the
crux
of
the
claim
that
was
litigated
in
this
case
from
the
trial
court
all
the
way
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court
is:
was
the
condition
to
perform
offsite
mitigation,
and
that
was
accepted
as
true
by
the
courts
below,
that
this
was
a
condition
that
had
been--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--we
agree
that
there
were
negotiations
and
that
even
in
the
orders
allege
that
various
options
were
provided
to
mr.
koontz,
but
ultimately
the
decision,
as
the
district
admits,
the
decision,
the
final
decision
to
deny
the
permit
application
for
3.7
acres
of
use
was
mr.
koontz's
refusal
to
acquiesce
in
the
condition
that
he
perform
50
acres
of
offsite
improvements.
and
by
the
way,
the
reference--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
pages
70
to
71,
which
is
the
pretrial
statement
where
each
party
sets
forth
his
and
her
position.
there
the
court
--
i'm
sorry
--
the
district
made
clear
that
the
condition
that
had
been
refused
and
was
the
cause
of
the
permit
denial
was
the
one
to
perform
offsite
mitigation
at
a
cost
of
a
range
between
$10,000
on
the
low
end,
our
experts
said
in
the
range
of
100
to
150,000
--
90
to
150,000.
so,
the
district
later
on,
even
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
justice
ginsburg,
said
in
its
petitioner's
brief
on
jurisdiction
at
page
1
that
it
required
additional
mitigation
before
it
would
authorize
the
permits
and
that
quote:
"additional
mitigation
would
be
offsite
because
the
available
conservation
land
on
site
was,
in
the
district's
view,
insufficient
mitigation.
"
so
there's
no
question
that
an
actual
condition
was
imposed,
whose
rejection
produced
a
permit
denial.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
i
want
to
be
clear
that
we're
not
saying
that
all
monetary
fees
or
exactions
would
be
subject
to
nollan
and
dolan,
only
within
the
permit
context,
the
special
context
of
land
use
permitting.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
correct.
if
the
state
or
the
government
or
the
permitting
authority
asks
for
the
--
for
the
property
owner
to
give
up
property,
even
money
to
be
put
to
a
public
use
and
it's
not
an
application
for
your
user
fee
or
something
like
that,
it's
for
mitigation,
that
should
be
subject--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--correct,
it
would
be
subject
to
nollan
and
dolan
analysis
to
determine
if
they're
really
on
the
ground,
there's
a
connection
between
the
impact--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--in
nollan
and
dolan,
your
honor,
nothing
was
taken,
either.
in
nollan
you
had
a
permit
approval
with
conditions.
it's
true
that
development
had
not
gone
forward,
but
here
as
well
development
had
not
gone
forward.
presumably
--
theoretically
if
the
development
had
gone
forward
he
might
have
been
subject
to
conditions
that
he
would
have
had
to
satisfy.
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--the
permits
in
nollan
and
dolan
actually
did
not
issue.
there
was
only
approval
with
conditions
and
there
is
a
difference.
and
that
is
no
different
from
what
happened
here.
the
threat
is
the
same.
you
don't
get
a
permit
issued
to
you
until
you--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--but
in
either
case
he
faces
the
threat,
the
unconstitutional
condition
on
his
use
of
his
property:
you
don't
get
your
use
until
you
comply
with
our
conditions.
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--no.
the
due
--
there
is
no
due
process
claim
here.
there
is
only
a
state
statute
that
embodies
sort
of
a
due
process
standard,
but
there
is
no
due
process
claim
here.
and
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
thank
you.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
point
the
court,
and
particularly
justice
scalia,
to
pages
30
and
31
of
our
brief
on
the
merits
where
we
describe
with
citations
to
the
nollan
and
dolan,
what
precisely
happened
there.
i
want
to
make
sure
that
it's
clear
that
what
they
did
there
was
not
issue
permits.
they
approved
with
conditions,
but
the
property
owner
still
had
to
satisfy
the
conditions
in
order
to
receive
the
permit.
as
to
the
question
about--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--justice
sotomayor,
i
don't
believe
that
negotiations
will
suddenly
break
down,
and
we
will
see
a
flurry
of
permit
denials
if
the
court
rules
in
our
favor.
what
will
happen,
instead
--
it's
true,
i
should
say,
they
will
lose
flexibility
in
demanding
whatever
it
is
that
they
want
under
the
takings
clause.
they
won't
have
any
review.
but
the
benefit
of
applying
our
rule
that
says
monetary
exaction
should
be
treated
like
other
exactions
and
be
reviewed
under
nollan
and
dolan--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--no
question
that
we
all
are
subject
on
a
daily
basis
to
government
demands
that
we
pay,
that
we
have
a
financial
obligation.
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
if
the
legislation
requires
an
agency
who
processes
a
permit
to
impose
a
fee
in
exchange
for
a
permit
--
again,
within
the
land-use
context,
we
are
not
talking
about
taxes,
homeowners
fees,
we
are
talking
within
the
discretionary
land-use
process
--
that
is
imposed
there,
then
the
risk
of
coercion,
undue
influence
and
the
like
arise
and
nollan
and
dolan
should
apply.
but
i
wanted
to
respond
specifically
to
justice
breyer's
questions
about
penn
central.
i
think
conceptually
there
is
an
important
difference
between
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
which
is
what
we
seek
to
apply
here,
and
what
would
be
a
permit
--
or
what
would
be
a
penn
central
claim.
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine,
the
offense
there
is
the--
mr.
paul
j.
beard
ii
--the
offense
there
is
the
conditioning,
the
improper
conditioning
of
a
permit.
it's
not
did
the
condition
force
me
to
lose
the
value
in
my
land.
that's
a
very
different
question
that
a
case
like
