it's
--
it's
my
understanding
that
there
is
a
place
where
texas
can
put
a
line
into
the
river,
and
then
a
subset
of
that
question
is,
the
main
stem
of
the
river,
through
--
without
going
through
oklahoma
property,
other
than
perhaps
just
the
bank
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
say
entirely
within
oklahoma,
just
because
of
ownership
of
the
banks?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
because
of
there's
also
some
intervening
property
between
texas
and
the
bank
that
oklahoma
owns?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
--
do
the
current
laws
prohibit
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--at
any
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
agree
with
your
reading
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
it
seems
to
me
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
consistent
with
the
respondents'
argument
that
they
looked
at
the
terms
of
the
compact.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
may
be
right
that
the
compact
either
says
you
get
the
water
or
you
don't,
and
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
just
irrelevant.
but
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
being
quite
consistent
with
that
proposition.
you
win
or
you
lose,
up
or
down,
under
the
compact.
the
dormant
commerce
clause
doesn't
--
just
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
the
way
i
read
the
analytic
approach
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
39a,
when
it
starts
talking
about
the
point
of
--
section
5.05.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
be
clear,
in
your
view,
texas
can,
without
going
on
oklahoma
property,
take
water
from
the
main
stem
in
basin
5?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
question
was,
can
they
take
it
from
the
main
stem--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
that
the
part
that,
under
their
allegation
at
least,
is
saline?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
is
that
the
part
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--they
are
referring
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
they
say
it's
too
saline?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this
is
a
--
a
perfectly
legitimate
argument
for
you
to
make,
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question.
at
least
as
i
understood
it,
it's
this:
i
want
you
to
assume
--
i
know
you
don't
agree
with
that
--
i
want
you
to
assume
that
the
compact
gives
texas
a
right
to
25
percent
of
the
--
of
the
excess
--
of
the
water
above
the
cubic
foot.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
want
you
to
assume
that.
now,
wouldn't
the
compact
be
meaningless
if
texas
couldn't
actually
reach
that
water?
