mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
red
river
compact,
oklahoma
agreed
that
texas
would
be
allowed
to
use
a
specified
quantity
of
water
that
is
located
in
oklahoma.
oklahoma
is
now
trying
to
back
out
of
that
bargain.
what
its
argument
to
this
court
in
support
of
its
position
is
essentially
that
the
court
should
disregard
language
that
appears
in
the
red
river
compact
because
that
language
is
superfluous,
that
the
court
should
read
into
the
compact
language
that
does
not
appear
there,
and
that
the
court
should
not
give
the
text
of
the
compact
what
oklahoma
in
its
brief
describes
as
talismanic
significance.
our
very
different
view
is
that
the
plain
text
of
the
compact
must
control.
now,
in
the
red
river
compact,
texas
and
oklahoma,
along
with
louisiana
and
arkansas,
agreed
to
allocate
among
themselves
the
waters
of
the
red
river
basin.
the
compact
divides
that
basin
into
large
areas
called
reaches
and
subdivides
the
reaches
into
subbasins.
as
to
some
of
those
areas,
the
compact
expressly
allocates
entitlement
to
water
by
state
line.
it
says
that
the
states
may
use
the
water
within
their
boundaries
exclusively.
but
in
the
section
of
the
compact
which
is
at
issue
here,
reach
2,
subbasin
5,
the
compact
uses
a
very
different
and
unique
language.
that
section
--
that
subbasin
includes
the
territory
of
three
of
the
four
compacting
states.
the
boundaries
of
that
subbasin
are
drawn
not
by
state
lines,
but
by
reference
to
the
--
the
last
downside
dam
sites
before
tributaries
to
the
red
river
basin
--
red
river
flow
into
the
river
itself.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
provision
that
we
are
relying
on,
i
would
say
is
not
sketchy
at
all.
it
is
quite
clear
that
all
four
of
the
compacting
states
are
in
the
language
of
the
compact,
have
equal
rights
to
the
use
of
water,
defined
water
in
a
defined
area
of
the
subbasin,
so
long
as
no
state
uses
more
than
25
percent
of
the
water.
that
--
that
is
quite
express
as
to
what
is
required.
in
--
it's
difficult
to
read
that
language
to
mean
anything
other
than
that
the
states
can
take--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
appears
--
it
is
reprinted
on
page
8
of
the
blue
brief
in
the
indented
text,
and
it
says,
"within
this
--
within
this
subbasin,
the
signatory
states
have
equal
rights
to
the
use
of.
"
and
then
it
defines
the
water
that
they
have
the
rights
to
the
use
of,
“
at
times
of
normal
flow
”
--
with
the
flow
of
the
red
river
at
3,000
cubic
feet
per
second
at
the
arkansas/louisiana
border
--
"provided
that
no
state
is
entitled
to
more
than
25
percent
of
the
water
in
excess
of
this
amount.
"
so
the
--
the
gist
of
the
language
is
states
have
--
all
--
all
four
signatory
states
have
equal
rights
to
the
use
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
have
to
disagree
with
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
says
that
--
the
section
is
designed
to
allocate
the
water
of
the
subbasin,
and
it
says,
"within
the
subbasin,
states
have
equal
rights
to
use
of
the
runoff.
"
that's
the
first
part
of
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
second
part
of
it
then
says,
"provided
that
no
state
is
entitled
to
more
than
25
percent--
"
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--a
couple
points
to
say
about
that.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
at
all
a
complex
job.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
right.
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--okay.
again,
several
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
in
all
these
other
compacts
to
which
justice
ginsburg
alludes
that
are
cited
by
our
opponents,
which
expressly
allow
for
cross-border
--
virtually
none
of
them
provide
any
of
the
kinds
of
details
that
you
are
describing.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
what
i
say
--
i
guess
i
will
say
two
things
about
that.
one,
i
think
what
you
just
say
is,
in
fact,
with
respect,
is
not
consistent
with
the
language.
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--equal
rights
to
use
of
specified
water.
it
--
the
--
the
subbasin
is
defined,
again,
not
by
state
lines;
it's
defined
by
--
by
downstream
dam
sites.
so
it
has
created
a
pool
of
water
in
the
--
in
this
subbasin,
and
it
says
that
all
four
states
have
equal
rights
to
use
of
this
water,
provided
that
none
takes
more
than
25
percent.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
face
of
it,
that
is
saying
state
lines
are
not
relevant
and
that
what
we
are
looking
at
is
a
pool
of
water
the
states
can
come
and
get
it.
and
it
is
particularly
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
i
may
just
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
and
i
think
to
the
extent
that
there
could
be
any
ambiguity
in
the
--
in
that
language
viewed
in
isolation,
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
compact,
there
are
places
where
the
drafters
of
the
compact,
in
fact,
did
refer
to
state
lines.
they
said
that
states
are
entitled
to
use
the
water
within
their
state
values,
the
respective
states
may
use
the
water
within
their
boundaries.
they
did
not
--
the
framers
did
not
use
that
language
in
this
provision.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
will--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me
make
two
points
about
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
not
only
does
it
make
sense
in
the
language;
it's
compelled
by
the
language,
because
the
language
says
within
this
subbasin
all
four
states
have
equal
rights.
separately,
there
is
another
separate
reach.
reach
v
of
the
compact
is
louisiana's,
and
so
the
water
flows
into
louisiana.
when
the
water
gets
to
louisiana,
it's
no
longer
within
the
subbasin,
it's
somewhere
else.
so
the
plain
language
of
the
compact
compels
the
reading
--
compels
the
--
the
point
that
louisiana
could
take
its
water
from
within
the
subbasin.
now,
could
it
do
that?
the
subbasin
runs
through
to
arkansas
to
louisiana,
so
it
could
go
to
louisiana--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
i
may
just
finish
with
justice
sotomayor
and
i
will
turn
to
that?
i
think
the
second
answer
to
the
question
is,
the
states
are
going
to
take
the
water
from
the
closest
point
where
they
can
get
it.
and
so
louisiana
is
not
going
to
go
to
oklahoma.
if
it's
going
to
go
into
subbasin
5,
it's
going
to
go
to
arkansas
directly
across
the
state
line.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
has
to
apply
to
whichever--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
it's
going
to
oklahoma,
and
this
is
partially
responsive
to
justice
breyer,
it
would
have
to
apply
to
the
water
authorities
within
oklahoma.
so
what
is
going
on
here,
tarrant,
the
texas
water
district,
is
applying
to
the
oklahoma
water
resources
board.
it
will
seek
a
permit.
this
will
operate
precisely
in
the
same
way
as
if
an
oklahoma
applicant
is
seeking
a
permit.
you
will
go
to
--
you
will
go
and
say,
i
want
to
take
water
out
of
this
point.
the
water
resources
board
will
apply
its
ordinary
standards
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
can
be
granted.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
tarrant
presumably
will
do
that.
if
tarrant
needs
to
obtain
rights
of
way,
oklahoma
law
provides
for
exercise
of
eminent
domain,
or
tarrant
can
simply
purchase
the
property
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
--
that
i
think
is
not
correct
as
a
factual
matter.
the
--
the
red
river
lies
entirely
within
oklahoma,
and
so
oklahoma,
in
order
to
get
water
out
of
the
main
stem,
if
--
if
texas
were
to
do
that,
it
would
have
to
go
into
oklahoma.
and
--
and
in
fact,
this
is
in
response
to
--
in
part
to
what--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--because--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
--
the
border
between
oklahoma
and
texas
is
the
south
vegetation
line
of
the
red
river,
so
therefore
it
is
out
of
the
river
past
the
bank
to
the
vegetation
line.
so
in
order
to
get
water
out
of
the
main
stem,
oklahoma
and
--
texas
would
have
to
go
into
oklahoma.
now,
there
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--oklahoma's
current
laws
would,
i
would
think,
prevent--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--at
any
point,
because
the
laws
that
tarrant
is
challenging
here
are
laws
that
are
discriminatory
oklahoma
laws
that
prevent
any
use
of
water
originating
in
oklahoma
outside.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
right.
and
that
--
if
i
may,
justice
alito,
that
is
--
that's
a
very
misleading
way
of
looking
at
it.
and
i
think
oklahoma's
brief
suggests
that
the
texas
rangers
are
going
to
descend
on
oklahoma
and
seize
the
water.
that
is
not
what
--
what
is
contemplated.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
i
--
there
is
an
--
there
is
an
oklahoma
statute
that
says
in
order
to
--
someone
who
has
a
permit
to
obtain
water
can
exercise
eminent
domain.
an
oklahoma
person
can
do
this.
a
texas
person
can
do
this.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
oklahoma
cannot
use
more
than
25
percent
of
the
water
within
the
subbasin.
i
think
that
our
friends
concede
that,
because
the
language
of
the
compact
says
no
state
is
entitled
to
more
than
25
percent.
within
each
state's
25
percent
allocation,
a
resident
water
user
of
the
state
will
apply
to
the
oklahoma
--
if
they
are
seeking
to
take
their
water
from
oklahoma,
it
will
apply
to
the
oklahoma
water
resources
board,
which
will
assess
that
permit
precisely
as
it
assesses
permits
from
oklahoma
residents.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
--
if
there
is
a
request
for
that
much
water
from
a
texas
user,
and
the
texas
user
has
priority
as
a
permit
applicant
against
others
who
are
seeking
to
take
water
from
this
particular--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
it
does
not.
it's
--
all
--
all
the
compact
says
is
that
texas
is
entitled
to
take
water
from
within
the
subbasin,
its
25
percent.
now
when
it
applies
in
a
particular
place,
as
tarrant
has
done
here,
it's
going
to
apply
--
be
consistent
with
the
oklahoma
water
resources
board
permit
application
policies,
as
it
has
done.
the
resources
board
will
assess
that
permit
application
just
as
it
would
assess
an
application
from--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
--
a
permit
applicant
submits
an
application,
which
has
to
demonstrate
that
it
satisfies
the
standards
for
obtaining
the
water.
that
will
be
assessed
on
its
merits
by
the
water
resources
board.
if
there
are
competing
applications
for
the
same
water,
then
it's
--
it's
done
in
the
terms
of
priority
--
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
is
their
current
policy.
that
would
not
be
all
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
suppose
there
--
there
are
two
points
there.
one
is,
if
there
is
enough
water
to
go
around
for
everyone,
as
in
fact
there
is,
then
they
simply
assess
it
in
terms
of
priority
in
time.
whoever
makes
the
first
application
will
get
it.
however,
oklahoma
can
only
get
--
use
25
percent
of
the
water.
and
therefore,
texas
has
the
right,
so
long
as
there
is
water
available
and
texas
has
not
used
its
25
percent
of
the
subbasin
water,
texas
has
the
right
to
seek
that
anywhere
it
can
get
it
in
the
subbasin.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
of
points.
first,
my
friend,
ms.
blatt,
said
that
it
would
make
mincemeat
and
a
complete
mess
out
of
the
compact
to
apply
its
terms
as
they
were
written.
we
think
that
this
compact
was
negotiated
over
a
period
of
25
years.
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
very
painfully
see
that
there
are
reams
and
reams
of
commentary
on
the
--
on
the
negotiations.
i
think
the
court
has
to
assume
that
when
the
drafters
of
the
compact
used
language
and
referred
to
state
lines
in
one
place
and
not
in
another
place,
they
had
some
idea
of
what
they
were
doing
and
they
made
these
different
choices
intentionally.
so
i
think
the
court
simply
should
read
the
terms
of
the
compact--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
don't
think
that
it
has
to
mean
that.
if
oklahoma
wants
to
enter
texas
to
take
--
if
it
makes
more
sense
for
them
to
do
it,
they
can.
if
not,
they
can
just
wait
for
the
water
to
flow
down.
i
think
one
thing
which
--
which
ms.
blatt
did
not
address
is
the
practicalities
of
how
subbasin
5
operates.
if
you
look
at
the
map
that
was
pointed
out
to
you,
subbasin
5,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here,
is
a
very
wide
--
hundreds
of
miles
wide,
but
extremely
narrow.
it's
10
to
20
miles
wide
--
north
to
south
for
most
of
its
length.
the
reason
the
drafters
drew
this
is
because
the
states
all
take
--
the
assumption
was
all
of
the
water
in
this
subbasin
was
going
to
be
surplus
water,
literally
excess
water.
the
states
all
take
the
water
that
they
want
to
use
outside
of
subbasin
5,
and
so
the
--
the
allocations
that
ms.
blatt
was
referring
to
by
oklahoma
are
all
in
subbasin
1;
they
are
not
in
subbasin
5.
the
water
that
flows
into
subbasin
5
is
water
that
the
states
assumed
was
going
to
be
surplus.
and
so
it
would
make
no
sense,
having
divided
this
water
evenly
between
the
compacting
states,
to
think
that
the
drafters
would
have
required
a
water
user
in
texas
at
the
far
west
end,
which
would
get
its
portion
of
the
25
percent
share
two
miles
across
the
border
in
oklahoma,
instead
to
have
to
go
200
miles
to
the
east
to
get
it
out
of
texas.
that
is
not
what
the
drafters
intended
to
accomplish
by
this.
they
created,
by
the
plain
terms
of
the
--
of
the
language,
a
common
pool
of
water
defined
by
dam
site,
not
by
state
line,
and
gave
each
state
equal
rights
to
access
that
water
so
long
as
they
did
not
use
more
than
25
percent.
your
response
to
a
question
which
was
raised
by
justice
kagan
both
to
me
and
ms.
blatt,
i
think
the
practical
application
of
this
is
very
simple.
one
simply
has
to
apply
to
the
permitting
authorities,
wherever
you're
submitting
your
application
from,
they
will
apply
their
ordinary
standards.
oklahoma
water
resources
board
does
that
now
for
applications
from
within
oklahoma;
it
can
do
it
just
as
well
for
applications
from
texas
or
other
from
other
states.
and,
again,
the
practicality
of
this
is,
water
users
are
going
to
want
to
use
water
as
close
to
where
they
are
located
as
they
can.
they're
going
to
go
right
across
the
state
line
within
subbasin
5
if
that's
the
place
to
get
the
water.
it
makes
no
sense
to
require
them
to
go
hundreds
of
miles
distant
to
get
it.
ms.
blatt
suggested
that
we
are
reading
the
25
percent
limitation
out
of
the
compact.
i
think
her
reading
reads
the
equal
rights
language
out
of
the
compact.
they
read
the
subbasin
5
language
as
being
all
capped
and
no
entitlement.
it
does
two
things:
it
gives
equal
rights
to
the
water,
and
then
says
that
you
can't
take
more
than
25
percent
within
your
state.
so
it's
designed
to
do
two
things.
it's
designed
to
give
you
an
entitlement
and
to
say
you
can
only
use
25
percent
of
it.
and
finally,
ms.
blatt
raised
questions
of
sovereignty
and
political
concern.
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
this
is
a
compact
that's
an
agreement
between
coordinate
sovereigns.
they
have
decided
what
they
want
to
do.
and
the
thing
that
gives
respect
to
sovereignty
is
to
read
the
plain
language
of
the
compact
as
the
framers
wrote
it.
again,
they
spent
25
years
writing
it.
they
took
considerable
care,
as
you
can
tell
if
you
look
at
the
negotiating
history,
in
using
the
words
for
each
provision.
those
words
should
be
given
meaning.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
