ms.
ann
o'connell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
oklahoma
may
categorically
foreclose
texas
water
users
from
accessing
reach
ii
subbasin
5
water
in
oklahoma,
and
the
court
reached
that
conclusion
for
reasons
that
in
the
view
of
the
united
states
are
wrong.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
applying
a
presumption
against
preemption
to
determine
whether
the
challenged
oklahoma
laws
conflict
with
the
compact.
the
rationale
for
that
presumption
where
it
has
been
applied
is
one
of
federalism,
but
the
states
themselves
created
the
terms
of
the
interstate
compact,
and
respect
for
the
states
as
sovereigns
in
that
context
requires
enforcement
of
the
compact
according
to
its
terms.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
general
compact
provisions
to
conclude
that
the
compact
gives
states
unrestricted
authority
to
regulate
the
water
within
their
boundaries.
but
the
general
provisions
of
the
compact
make
clear
that
a
state's
regulation
of
water
has
to
be
consistent
with
the
allocations
made
under
the
compact,
and
each
state's
obligations
under
the
compact.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
we
agree
with
that.
we
don't
think
that
the
dormant
commerce
clause
comes
into
play
here.
we
think
that
whether
texas
can
access
the
water
in
oklahoma
through
the
oklahoma
permitting
process
depends
entirely
on
whether
the
compact
gives
them
that
right
or
not.
ms.
ann
o'connell
right.
and
we
don't
disagree
with
that,
that
the
--
that
the
commerce
clause
shouldn't
come
into
play
here.
where
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
is
with
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that,
regardless
of
whether
a
state
law
would
frustrate
the
purpose
or
pose
an
obstacle
to
a
state
obtaining
its
share
of
water
under
the
compact,
that
that
state
law
should
prevail
under
the
compact.
so
the
compact
makes
clear
that
those
general
provisions
preserving
state
water
law
need
to
be
consistent
with
each
state's
obligations
under
the
compact.
and
if
i
could--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
first
of
all,
we
think
that
that's
an
issue
that,
if
the
court
decided
that
--
that
there
are
errors
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
should
be
corrected,
we
think
that's
something
the
court
of
--
that
the
lower
courts
could
consider
on
remand.
but
i'll
tell
you
where
it
comes
from,
which
is
sections
2.01
and
2.10(a)
of
the
compact,
which
preserve
the
application
of
state
water
law.
section
2.01
says
that,
"each
state
may
freely
administer
water
rights
and
uses
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
that
state,
but
that
such
--
such
uses
shall
be
subject
to
the
availability
of
water
in
accordance
with
the
compact.
"
ms.
ann
o'connell
no.
what
we're
saying
is
that
if
there's
a
state
law
that
conflicts
with
the
allocation
or
poses
an
obstacle
to
the
allocation
of
water
under
the
compact,
then
it's
preempted.
but,
for
example,
if
texas
could
access
25
percent
of
the
water
from
within
its
state,
then
the
--
the
application
of
a
state
law
that
would
bar
texas
water
users
from
obtaining
a
portion
of
its
water
in
oklahoma
wouldn't
necessarily
be
preempted,
because
it
wouldn't
pose
an
obstacle
to
the
allocation.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
we
think
--
again,
we
think
this
is
a
--
an
issue
for
the
court
of
--
for
the
lower
courts
to
look
at
on
remand,
but
we
think
there's
a
--
there's
a
good
argument
to
be
made
that,
so
long
as
texas
could
access
25
percent
of
the
water
within
its
boundaries,
then
application
of
an
oklahoma
law
that
would
prohibit
texas
from
going
through
the
oklahoma
permitting
process
wouldn't
necessarily
be
preempted.
and
again,
we
--
these
--
these
--
there
are
lots
of
issues,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
we
did
at
the
invitation
stage,
that
would
need
to
be
addressed,
perhaps,
in
further
proceedings
or
perhaps
before
the--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--justice
kagan,
i'd
like
to,
if
i
could,
go
to
the
second
point,
which
is
on
the
--
the
--
whether
you
read
this
as
a
25
percent
entitlement
or
a
cap,
and
i
would
like
to
point
the
court,
not
just
to
the
language
of
the
compact,
which
we
think
weighs
in
favor
of
the
idea
that
each
right
--
each
state
has
an
equal
right
and
that
the
--
the
equal
right
to
use
the
water
in
the
subbasin
implies
an
equal
right,
not
just
an
opportunity.
but
the
interpretive
comments
that
follow
section
5.05(b)
--
this
is
at
page
30
of
the
is
joint
appendix
--
refer
to
a
“
right
”.
the
first
full
paragraph
there
says,
“
when
the
flows
”
--
i'm
sorry;
it's
the
--
the
second
line.
"if
the
states
have
competing
uses
and
the
amount
of
water
available
in
excess
of
3,000
cubic
feet
per
second
cannot
satisfy
all
such
uses,
each
state
will
honor
the
other
state's
right
to
25
percent
of
the
excess
flow.
"
the
red
river
compact
commission
also
approved
rules
and
regulations,
and
those
say
--
they're
on
page,
i
think,
19
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
might
have
that
page
--
yeah,
i
have
that
page
wrong.
but
the
--
the
red
river
compact
commission's
rules
and
regulations
say
that
when
the
flow
is
above
12,000
cubic
feet
per
second,
so
that
louisiana
could
get
its
3,000
cubic
feet
per
second,
"each
of
the
signatory
states
shall
be
entitled
to
25
percent
of
the
total
runoff
in
undesignated
flow.
"
so
i
think
it
--
it's
pretty
clear
that
based
on
the
--
both
the
text
of
the
compact
and
the
interpretive
comments
in
the
rules
that
the
red
river
compact
commission
came
up
with,
that
there
is
not
just
that
you
can
take
whatever
is
in
your
borders
even
if
that
doesn't
amount
to
25
percent,
but
--
but
that
each
state
is
entitled
to
25
percent
of
the
water,
and
that
if
that
involves
going
into
another
state
within
this
geographic
area
that's
not
defined
with
respect
to
state
boundaries,
then
that
is
permissible
under
the
compact.
and
as
the
petitioner
pointed
out,
when
the
states
wanted
to
impose
a
state
boundary
restriction
in
the
compact,
they
did
so.
there
are
several
subbasins
that
span
more
than
one
geographic
--
or
more
than
one
state,
and
the
compact
in
those
provisions
says
that
you
can
take
whatever
you
want
within
your
boundaries.
and
i
also
don't
think
that
this
is
going
to
be
particularly
troublesome
to
administer.
i
mean,
there
may
need
to
be
some
further
proceedings
on
that,
but
oklahoma
law
provides
the
backdrop
for
what
would
happen
when
a
texas
water
user
goes
in
to
--
to
ask
for
a
permit
to
appropriate
and
divert
water
from
within
oklahoma.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
the
oklahoma
water
resources
board
would
just
apply
its
normal
procedures
and
laws
to
determine
whether
this
particular
use
of
water
could
be
put
to
beneficial
use.
if
--
they
would
just
apply
whatever
laws
they
would
apply
to
any
applicant,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
from
texas
or
oklahoma.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--well,
i
think
just
as
--
as
petitioner's
counsel
pointed
out,
there's
a
--
a
priority
in
water
law,
where
whoever
submits
the
application
first
would
--
would
get
the
water
if
it's
available
and
they
can
put
it
to
beneficial
use.
and
i
--
and
i
--
the
court
shouldn't
be
concerned.
i
know
all
--
i
know
there
are
amicus
briefs
submitted
by
other
texas
entities
that
would
like
to
have
water
from
this
particular
subbasin
as
well.
they're
all
part
of
the
same
region
c,
and
they
--
i
think
they
have
some
way
to
work
it
out.
it's
not
like
they--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--that
--
true,
to
the
extent
that
texas
was
not
receiving
its
water.
i
mean,
under
--
under
our
theory,
which
we
think
could
be
developed
more
in
the
lower
courts,
if
texas
was
already
receiving
25
percent
of
the
water,
then
oklahoma
would
not
have
to
give
it
any
kind
of
special
priority.
but
if
it
--
if
it
was
not,
then
the
oklahoma
water
resources
board
would
treat
it
just
like
an
oklahoma
applicant.
ms.
ann
o'connell
yes.
ms.
ann
o'connell
and
in
oklahoma
as
well.
ms.
ann
o'connell
this
--
this
is
the
last
point
made
in
the
respondent's
brief--
ms.
ann
o'connell
--and
--
and
the
response
to
that
would
just
be
that
all
of
the
states
would
have
the
opportunity
to
do
that.
in
fact,
the
whole
subbasin
is
defined
by
the
last
major
dam
site
on
the
tributaries
that
are
running
in.
so
oklahoma
could
do
the
same
thing.
and
also,
when
the
reservoirs
are
full,
they're
full.
it's
not
like
texas
could
keep
all
of
the
water
that's
--
that's
there
from
flowing
into
the
bottom
portion
of
that
tributary.
ms.
ann
o'connell
well,
i
--
it's
--
we
don't
think
it
needs
to
be
decided
in
this
particular
proceeding.
i
think
there
are
two
errors
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
in
applying
a
presumption
against
preemption
and
in
concluding
that
a
texas
water
user
could
never
divert
water
from
outside
of
its
state.
those
could
be
developed
--
those
additional
problems
could
be
dealt
with
by
the
oklahoma
water
resources
board
or
as
you
said,
perhaps
in
the
original
action.
