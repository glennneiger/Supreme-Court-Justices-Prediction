mr.
rothfeld,
we
are
told
that
in
other
compacts
when
they
really
mean
to
give
one
state
the
right
to
take
another
state's
water,
the
provision
in
the
compact
is
much
clearer,
much
more
definite.
this
clause,
the
one
that
you
rely
on,
is
kind
of
sketchy,
isn't
it?
doesn't
say
how
they're
going
to
get
it,
if
they're
going
to
pay
for
it.
there's
a
lot
to
be
filled
in.
justice

how
--
how
does
it
do
it?
does
it
have
to
apply
to
texas?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
oklahoma.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
--
who
erects
the
facilities
to
accomplish
this
diversion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
say
that
again,
because
we
have
a
green
brief
that
gives
us
samples
of
provisions
for
cross
border.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
there
have
been
many,
many--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
blatt,
does
oklahoma
law
in
any
circumstance
permit
an
appropriation
of
water
--
water
in
oklahoma
for
out-of-state
use?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
here
and
now,
does
oklahoma
ever--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--permit
out-of-state
use
of
its
water?
