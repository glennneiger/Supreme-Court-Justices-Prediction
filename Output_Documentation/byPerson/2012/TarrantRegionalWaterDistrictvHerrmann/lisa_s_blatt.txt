ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
i
could
just
address
two
sort
of
factual
questions.
under
the
--
the
actual
red
river
boundary
compact,
the
lawyer
for
tarrant
was
wrong.
there's
actually
a
strip
called
shawnee
creek,
from
the
denison
dam
to
the
shawnee
creek,
that
actually
belongs
to
texas.
so
there's
a
piece
of
the
red
river
in
this
very
subbasin
that
is
--
it's
in
the
express
boundary
compact.
moreover,
all
of
the
red
river
and
lake
texoma
that
is
in
texas
is
part
of
the
main
stem,
and
that
is
not
only
in
the
land
of
texas,
texas
users
draw
water,
quite
a
lot
of
water,
from
lake
texoma.
so
that's
two
places
on
the
main
stem.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
can
and
does.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
who
knows?
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
who
knows?
texas
has
more
than
a
dozen
fresh
tributaries
running
from
subbasin
2
and
subbasin
4.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
subbasin
5,
these
are
all
--
excuse
me
--
these
are
tributaries
that
run
into
subbasin
5.
there
is
more
than
a
dozen
tributaries
in
subbasin
5.
for
30
years
no
one
has
ever
kept
track
of
any
kind
of
accounting
whatsoever,
so
when
we
say
“
who
knows
”?
that
is
the
way
the
drafters
--
it's
not
only
the
way
the
drafters
intended,
but
that
has
been
the
state
of
play
for
30
years.
so
nobody
--
and
in
the
laws
of
louisiana
and
arkansas
don't
even
track
diversions.
so--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--in
subbasin
5,
there
is
only
up
from
denison
dam
east
to
shawnee
creek.
so
that's
just
anywhere
from
a
half
a
mile
to
three-quarters.
it
runs
from
the
--
from
the
middle
of
the
channel.
east
--
excuse
me,
west
is
lake
texoma,
and
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
map,
it's
a
big
old
lake.
that
is
a
lot
of
water.
and
they
definitely
do
take
--
and
that's
in
the
brief
--
they
take
lots
of
water
from
that
lake
from
the
texas
side.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
only
in
that
--
that
little
slip
of
land
to
shawnee
creek.
it's
--
it's
a
part
of
texas--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--well,
again,
they
drink
the
water
in
subbasin
5.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
they
think--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
they
think
all
the
water
that
their
residents
drink
is
salty,
but
they
still
are
drinking
it.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
they're
drinking
it.
in
fact,
they're
--
footnote
3
and
footnote
4,
their
water
planning
documents,
say
this
is
a
--
quite
a
--
a
drinkable
source
of
water.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
i
understand
they
think
it's
salty,
but
they
drink
it.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
the--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--so
if
you
look
at
the
--
if
you
look
at
the
map
in
the
red
brief
that's
got
all
the
--
the
colors,
and
the
pink
is
subbasin
5.
so
where
they
divert
water
from
is
all
up
and
down
those
blue
tributaries
that
are
in
pink
south
of
the
red
river.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
this
is
33a--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--this
map.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
so
they
--
and
then
if
you
look
at
that
--
that
blue
lake
that
looks
like
a
dragon,
that
is
also
where
they
are
--
they
are
taking
water.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that
just
happens
to
be
in
reach
i.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
but
their
water
planning
documents
show
that
all
the
water
in
the
pink
on
the
texas
side
is
a
very
valuable
source
of
drinking
water.
and
if
you
see,
all
the
way
down
to
lake
texarkana,
they
can
--
they
are
taking
that
water,
too.
and
when
we
say
about
what
we
know,
no
one
has
ever
done
any
accounting
because
the
equal
rights
clause
has
always
been
read
as
equal
rights
to
the
use
of
the
water
without
prejudice
to
or
from
each
other's
state,
and,
in
that
sense,
it
means
that
if
one
state
took
an
earlier
use
of
the
water,
it
wouldn't
gain
a
priority
indefinitely
over
the
other
states.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
i
mean,
it
is
our
position
that
the
states
would
have
never
agreed
to
this
extraordinary
right
without
an
--
an
unequivocal
explicit
statement.
but
i
do
think
it
is
absolutely
critical
to
understand
that
what
they
are
asking
for
is
unprecedented,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
has
never
been
a
cross-border
diversion
--
ever
--
under
any
state
water
compact.
and
the
two
examples
they
cite
in
their
reply
brief
are
inexplicable
--
absolutely
inexplicable.
they
cite
the
niobrara
compact
with
no
cite.
they
--
they
cite
the
compact,
but
they
never
say
there
has
been
a
cross-border
diversion.
and
if
you
look
on
the
map--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yeah,
under
explicit
right.
there
has
never
been
a
cross-border
diversion
without
an
explicit
statement.
not
only--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--many
with
explicit
statements
and
then
the
essential
bells
and
whistles
as
to
eminent
domain,
points
of
diversion,
and
which
choice
of
law.
and
what
they
tried
to
say,
because
we
have
been
saying
all
along
how
unprecedented
this
would
be
to
sort
of
read
in
silence
on
borders,
they
tried
to
come
up
with
two
examples
in
their
reply
brief.
and
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
the
reply
brief
is
not
only
--
is
devoid
of
a
citation,
but
nebraska
and
wyoming
told
both
us,
and
wyoming
told
tarrant's
counsel,
that
there
have
never
been
diversions.
and
nebraska
was
quite
--
like,
"wow,
we
hadn't
known
that.
"
and
it
shows
the
danger
of
their
position.
they
think
if
it's
silent
as
to
borders,
the
state
of
wyoming
can
go
hundreds
of
miles
into
nebraska
and
take
the
water
across
the
border.
the
other
example
they
cite
is
fascinating
because
it's
a
lawsuit
before
you.
they
cite
the
rio
grande
compact
as
a
basis
of
saying
el
paso
can
walk
into
new
mexico,
but
their
lawsuit
to
you
is
based
on
the
notion
that
texas
can't
go
into
new
mexico.
it's
new
mexico
has
a
downstream
delivery.
so--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--i'm
there.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
but
with
all
due
--
sorry.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
justice
breyer.
it's
just
not
true.
what
they
cite
to
is
a
1970
engineering
report--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--oh.
well,
the--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--oh.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
okay.
34
percent
of
the
watershed
is
in
texas,
so
there
is
no
reason
to
think
anyone
thought
texas
couldn't
get
its
share.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
there's
no
--
because
there's
no
evidence
there
was
any
discussion
about
any
state
and
whether
--
texas
never
complained.
no
one
ever
said
texas
couldn't
get
its
water.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
if
you--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--sure.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
we
did.
they
did
in
their
brief,
and
they
came
up
with
an
11
to
16
percent.
our
engineers
ran
the
numbers
after
correcting
their
three-series
method
--
methodological
errors,
and
we
came
up
with
29
percent.
they
--
they
double-counted
streams.
they
forgot
that
subbasin
5
is
not
only
runoff
but
also
rain.
and
then
--
this
one's
humorous
--
they
didn't
count
the
excess.
so
all
the
--
all
the
math
that
they
did
favored
texas,
so
the
math
didn't
come
out
that
way.
but
what's
interesting
about
the
tarrant's
view
in
juxtaposing
with
the
united
states'
view,
tarrant's
view
is
it
could
have
all
the
water,
but
they
could
get
all
of
it
still
from
oklahoma.
so
louisiana,
arkansas,
and
--
and
texas
could
come
take
all
their
share
from
oklahoma,
forcing
oklahoma
to
have
to
go
south.
now
the
united
states'
view,
and
this
is
i
--
they
read
a
border
limitation
in
there.
they
say,
"look,
borders
are
here,
but
if
texas
really
needs
it,
you
got
to
let
them
come
in.
"
that
--
that's
the
united
states.
they
definitely
--
which
i
don't
understand
their
reliance
on
the
russello
principle,
because
they
read
borders
into
this.
texas
has
actually
disavowed
this
view.
tarrant's
disavowed
it.
they
disavowed
it
to
the
tenth
circuit
when
the
tenth
circuit
asked
for
what
their
standing
would
to
be
to
press
it.
they
said,
“
we've
never
claimed
this
”.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
the
remedy?
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay.
yeah.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yeah.
so
let's--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--okay.
it's
the
last
statement.
the
compact
no
way,
no
how
entitles
the
parties
to
equal
25
percent.
it
just
doesn't
say
equal
rights
to
a
numerical
share.
it
doesn't
say
equal
rights
to
a
numerical
quantity.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
right.
and
you
and
i
could
have
equal
rights
to
the
use
of
the
family
car
or
equal
rights
to
the
use
of
the
highway.
that
doesn't
tell
me
anything
about
how
many
hours
i
can
spend
on
the
highway.
but
here's
the
problem.
the
real
problem
is
with
the
cap.
okay?
their
view
is
that
the
first
clause
gives
you
an
absolute
equal
right
to
a
fixed
25
percent;
no
exceptions.
but
then
you
have
this
provided
clause
which
does
no
work
for
them.
the
provided
clause,
which
says
you
don't
get
any
more
than
25
percent,
they
are
saying,
"well,
by
definition,
if
you
get
exactly
25
percent,
the
state
can
take
no
more
than
25
percent.
"
so
they
actually
just
sort
of
combine
the
two.
the
other
--
i
hate
to
point
this
out,
because
i
--
i
feel
a
lot
of
affinity
for
the
united
states,
but
their
proof--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--affinity
for
them.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
but
listen
to
their
proof
for
why
there's
an
equal
25
percent.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
i
am,
but
i
used
to
work
for
them.
they
say
well,
we're
guaranteed
an
equal
25
percent
share,
and
they
cite
the
compliance
rules
on
page
19.
and
entertainingly
so,
the
rules
that
they
cite
just
disprove
what
they
said.
the
first
rule
they
cite
only
gave
3
states.
they
divided
it
by
3
instead
of
4.
their
view,
the
united
states'
view,
is
there's
a
guarantee
of
25
percent
of
any
amount
that's
in
excess
of
3,000.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
the
excess,
yeah.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
that
is
--
that
is
the
united
states'
view,
and
they'd
have
to
go
above
it.
what
they
would
have
to
do,
which
no
one
else
--
no
one
has
done
--
and
i
think
the
drafters
thought
it
was
ultimately
impossible
because
of
arkansas
and
louisiana,
is
call
for
an
accounting
and
actually
figure
out
what
the
total
was,
figure
out
what
the
excess
was,
divvy
up
the
4
shares,
do
exactly
what
tarrant
wants
i
guess
to
happen,
which
has
never
happened,
and
it's
not
clear
to
the
drafters
of
the
compliance
rules
that
it
could
in
fact
ever
happen
because
of
the
riparian
laws
of
arkansas
and
louisiana.
but
--
so
in
other
words,
if
we
lost
this
case,
which
is
probably
why
tarrant
is
disavowing
the
united
states'
view,
is
texas
would
be
in
quite
of
a
pickle
trying
to
prove
they
couldn't
get
their
25
percent.
and
so
i
read
tarrant
as
saying,
don't
you
dare
send
us
back
to
try
to
prove
that.
we
want
to
be
able
to
go
whole
hog
into
oklahoma.
and
if
i
could
get
to
the
point
that
justice
kagan
was
talking
about,
what's
on
the
ground
happening,
and
why
oklahoma
would
have
never
agreed
to
this
type
of
cross-border
right,
because
what
tarrant
is
doing
is
exploiting
oklahoma's
law,
which
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
water
in
oklahoma
is
a
public
trust
that's
held
for
the
exclusive
benefits
of
oklahoma.
and
there
are
three
ways
where
oklahoma
would
not
have
agreed
to
this,
and
it
would
have
been
carefully
articulated
in
a
compact.
the
first
is
prior
appropriation.
there
are
4
texas
entities
that
have
signed
up
for
permits:
the
upper
trinity,
the
north
texas
municipal
water
district,
irving
and
tarrant.
and
poor
oklahoma
city
got
sandwiched
in
the
middle.
it
beat
--
it
beat
trinity
to
the
permit
office
by
24
hours.
and
so,
not
surprisingly,
it's
open
season
for
oklahoma
water,
all
of
north
texas
has
come
in
and
sought
a
permit
and
there's
priority.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
i
have
two
points.
first,
had
--
had
oklahoma
seen
this
coming,
since
they
hadn't
heard
about
this
until
tarrant
filed
its
application,
oklahoma
city
certainly
would
have
gotten
in
line
faster.
and
second
of
all,
the
whole
point
of
this
compact
--
and
if
you
think
about
your
equitable
apportionment
doctrines,
which
whoever
gets
to
the
water
first
gets
a
prior
--
gets
a
priority
permanently
--
this
was
the
point
of
the
compact.
louisiana
and
arkansas
wouldn't
have
to
develop
their
water,
texas
and
oklahoma
were
much
more
economically
developed
states,
and
the
equal
rights
prevented
a
race
to
the
permit
office.
let
me
get
to
the
second
aspect
what's
a
problem,
and
that
is,
compacts
usually
spell
out
the
points
of
diversion.
the
last
place
oklahoma
would
have
picked
as
the
point
of
diversion
is
the
kiamichi
river,
and
tarrant
is
saying,
not
surprisingly,
it's
the
most
desirable.
and
the
third
is
the
eminent
domain.
eminent
domain
law
in
oklahoma
proceeds
on
the
assumption
that
those
are
oklahomans
who
got
the
permit,
and
thus
can
exercise
a
core
sovereign
power,
and
tarrant,
not
surprisingly,
would
like
to
come
in
and
do
that.
and
none
of
this
is
happening
with
the
normal
political
checks
in
oklahoma.
oklahoma
can't
vote
out
of
office
the
tarrant
officials.
it
cannot
vote
out
of
office
the
upper
trinity
or
the
north
texas
municipal
water
district.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
it's
--
if
it's
compacted
water,
you
have
to
get
legislative
approval
and--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--yes,
it
can.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
it
has
not.
it
could,
but
the
--
but
tarrant
is
correct
that
there
are
facial
differences
with
respect
to
out-of-state.
so
out-of-state
users
would
have
to
get
the
water
going
faster,
it's
subject
to
a
review.
and
there's
a
statement
in
there
that
you
need
to
look
and
see
if
there's
a
better
use
for
oklahoma.
now,
i
hope
you
ask
them
this,
because
i
gather
their
view
is
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
all
of
those
laws
are
constitutional
with
respect
to
99
percent
of
the
compact,
which
is
it's
allocated
to
--
to
oklahoma
for
its
free
and
unrestricted
use.
so
they're
basically
saying
there's
1
percent
of
this
compact
that's
unconstitutional.
and
not
only
is
it
1
percent,
the
minute
it
drops
below
3,000,
all
of
a
sudden,
it
became.
and
on
this,
we'd
like
to
talk
to
the
russello
principle.
i
also
hope
you
ask
them,
this
is
on
page
15a
of
--
14a
of
the
15a
brief.
there
are
border
references
arbitrarily
and
they're
missing,
they're
there.
it's
completely
inconsistent.
and
this
--
their
view
would
make
complete
mincemeat
out
of
4
other
provisions
of
the
compact.
and
ironically,
it
would
march
a
lot
of
states
into
texas.
but
back
to
(b)
--
(b)(2)
and
5.05(c)
operate
identical
in
that
they're
basically
downstream
delivery,
where
all
states
have
to
release
40
percent
of
the
water
downstream.
so
they
--
they're
the
same.
they're
absolutely
identical.
you
hold
on
to
60,
you
let
40
percent
go.
but
only
(c)
contains
that
border
reference.
only
(c)
says
“
within
their
respective
states
”.
and
yet
even
in
(c),
it's
completely
redundant
and
unnecessary,
because
you
can't
release
water
from
without
your
state.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
this
is
on
page
14a
and
15a
--
sorry
--
of
the
red
brief.
so
only
(c)
says
within
their
respective
states,
but
(b)(2)
is
the
exact
same
functioning
provision,
and
it's
missing
the
border
reference.
and
i
--
you
don't
have
time
now
to
ask
the
united
states'
view,
but
i
think
the
united
states
would
agree
with
us
that
if
you
give
this
border
thing
kind
of
the
magical
meaning,
borders
kind
of
appear
and
disappear
with
the
water
flow,
which
is
very
strange.
tarrant
thinks
that
there's
some
heretofore
unheard
of
crediting
system,
but
they
don't
have
an
explanation
on
how
(b)(2)
and
(c)
--
but
more
importantly,
if
you
could
just
turn
to
9a
for
just
a
minute,
which
is
402,
i
want
to
walk
you
through
this
--
i'm
sorry,
401(b).
this
is
a
provision
that
--
this
is
water
wholly
within
texas.
and
you
don't
have
to
understand
much
to
know
that
texas
keeps
60,
oklahoma
gets
40.
so
you
have
a
big
chunk
of
texas,
and
texas
is
allocated
60
and
oklahoma
is
allocated
40.
now,
under
tarrant's
view,
because
this
is
silent
as
to
borders
and
because
oklahoma
is
not
in
this
reach,
it's
not
actually
located
within
the
subbasin,
oklahoma
either
is
entitled
to
or
has
to
go
get
all
of
its
water
from
texas.
and
this
pattern
repeats
itself
--
this
is
on
page
41
of
our
brief
--
throughout
the
compact,
where
the
compact
is
silent
as
to
borders,
and
under
their
view
--
and
their
louisiana
view
is
somewhat
entertaining.
i
can't
tell
if
they
think
louisiana
can
go
into
oklahoma
or
has
to
move
one
inch
up
to
the
border
to
take
it
out
as
opposed
to
just
waiting,
but
under
this
view
--
and
again,
it
repeats
itself
throughout
the
contract
--
the
state
that's
not
in
the
basin,
because
there
are
no
borders
and
because,
i
guess
under
their
view,
the
only
way
that
oklahoma
to
get
its
water
would
be
to
go
into
texas,
and
that's
why
they're
sort
of
taking
this
bit
about,
oh,
this
russello
principle,
if
it's
here,
it
must
mean
--
it
must
have
had
significance,
would
make
a
complete
mess
of
the
compact.
if
i
could
also
just
turn
to
the
remand
of
the
united
states.
i
just
wanted
to
make
--
to
make
three
points.
and
that
is,
i
do
think
it
is
significant
that
it's
pointed
--
it
is
addressed
to
a
problem
that
texas
itself
has
never
asserted.
they're
saying
well,
poor
texas
can't
get
its
water.
and
remember,
texas
is
upstream,
so
this
sort
of
poor
texas
is
only
to
texas.
no
other
state
is
going
to
have
this
problem
because
the
rest
are
downstream.
so
this
you
have
to
be
able
to
get
to
your
25
percent
is
a
uniquely
pro-texas
provision
that
apparently
at
the
same
time
for
20
years
of
drafting
history
when
texas
was
trying
to
buy
this
water,
and
the
three
states
were
saying
“
no
way,
no
how
”,
they
either
subconsciously
or
unconsciously
or
unintentionally
enacted
this
provision
for
texas's
benefit.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
which
reach?
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
are
you
talking
about
401?
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay.
so
that's
in
reach
1.
so
that's
on
this
map
--
the
next
map.
so
none
of
it
--
it's
all
within
the
green,
the
same
with
the
panhandle
of
texas.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
yes.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
justice
breyer,
you
have
to
trust
me.
there
has
never
been
an
accounting
ever,
ever,
ever,
ever
under
this
compact.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
no
measurements
have
ever
been
taken
with
respect
to
this.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well,
there
are
gauges.
so
they
--
i
mean,
it
would
not
be
impossible,
although
very
expensive.
and
just
so
you
know,
section
211,
and
in
the
interpretive
comments
of
211,
the
state
said
the
last
thing
we
want
is
this
accounting
because
it's
expensive
and
burdensome.
and
louisiana
and
arkansas,
if
you
look
at
the
minutes,
they
are
complaining
because
their
laws
are
not
set
up
for
accounting.
they
are
riparian
states,
so
they
don't
track
diversions.
they
just
--
they
don't
do
it.
so
this
was
--
this
is
--
when
you
talk
about
how
this
cuts,
you
have
20
years
of
silence--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--okay.
so
when
you
comment--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
okay.
so
in
the
--
the
oklahoma
and
texas,
in
their
permitting
system,
what
they
permit,
they
track
how
much
you
take
under
the
permit.
they
measure.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
louisiana,
if
you
are
a
landowner,
you
just
draw
from
the
water
and
it's
a
--
it's
a
voluntary
reporting
system,
so
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
tell
the
state
how
much
you
took
out.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
so
one
is
a
permitting
system,
and
in
louisiana
and
arkansas
--
and,
i
think,
again,
the
minutes
just
talk
about
we
hope
louisiana
and
arkansas
will
develop
their
laws
to
do
better
tracking
of
diversions.
but
again,
this
would
be
the
problem
of
an
accounting.
but
i
--
so
in
terms
of
the
20
years
of
history,
you
have
complete
silence
on
this,
even
though,
under
our
view,
it
always--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
well--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--the--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--justice
breyer,
the
disaster
would
be
and
the
affront
to
sovereignty
is
throughout
the
compact,
not
so
much
the
measuring
that's
a
problem:
oklahoma
would
be
able
to
insist
on
crossing
texas's
borders
to
draw
that
40
percent.
and
no
one
has
ever,
ever
envisioned
any
of
the
compact
as
not
applying
borders.
it's
not
so
much
the
measurement.
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
okay.
but
their
view
--
i
mean,
it
is
that
they
have
to
--
again,
our
view
is
that
if
they
had
wanted,
like
all
the
other
cross-border
rights,
to
allow
for
an
extraordinary
right,
they
would
have
made
an
explicit
statement
and
then
spelled
out
exactly
what
that
meant,
most
importantly
the
point
of
diversion.
here,
at
most
you
have
silence
on
the
issue.
now,
the
government
reads
into
borders
sometimes,
because
they
say
you
do
have
borders
unless
there
is
a
need.
under
tarrant's
view,
which
i
think
is
the
most
jarring
and
remarkable
view,
this
is
all
a
borderless
common,
and
every
state
could
have
criss-crossing
pipelines
into
every
state,
because
you
don't
have
an
exhaustion
requirement.
so
texas,
even
though
it's
got
plenty
of
water
in
its
fresh
water
streams
and
currently
uses
them,
could
take
their
whole
25
percent
from
oklahoma;
oklahoma
could
take
its
whole
25
percent
from
texas;
arkansas
could
come
into
oklahoma
--
and
that's
their
view
of
the
world.
and
i
think
the
united
states
thought,
no,
that
doesn't
make
too
much
sense.
let's
at
least
make
texas
exhaust.
but
the
provision
--
the
compact
doesn't
say
this.
again,
the
united
states
and
tarrant
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
numerical
share,
that
it's
equal
rights
to
an
exact
25
percent,
exact
25
percent.
well,
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
just
says
equal
rights
to
the
use
subject
to
a
cap,
and
we
think
a
cap
by
limiting
the
use
is
not
a
guarantee
that
you
can
reach
the
cap,
much
less
that
you
can
cross
borders
to
reach
the
cap.
and
if
i
could
just
make
one
more
sense--
ms.
lisa
s.
blatt
--so
they
--
you
mean
the
two
compliance
rules
they
cited?
they
cited
--
so
they
say
--
that's
what
i
was
saying
that
was
sort
of
sad
is
because
what
they
cited
disproved
what
they
were
trying
to
assert
it
for.
so
if
you
--
you
don't
even
have
to
read
the
--
you
don't
even
have
to
read
the
compliance
rules.
just
read
page
19
of
their
brief.
they
say
in
the
same
sentence
that
we
have
an
equal
--
there's
an
equal
right
to
one-fourth
of
an
excess
above
3,000.
so
that
means
you
take
whatever
is
above
3,000
and
divide
by
four
equally.
and
then
they
cite
a
provision
that
only
divides
by
3.
and
then
the
next
provision
they
cite
didn't
divide
the
excess,
it
divided
the
total
water.
i
don't
know
why
they
--
it's
inexplicable.
i
can't
tell
you
why
they
did
that.
and
the
only
other
thing
i
want
to
say
on
the
extrinsic
evidence,
and
i
do
think
--
if
you
think
there's
any
ambiguity
in
here,
which
i
think
there
clearly
is,
you
have
30
years
of
post
ratification,
which
the
states
immediately
did
long-term
water
planning
without
so
mentioning
of
this
right.
and
tarrant
actually
offered
to
buy
the
same
water
for
$1.7
billion
in
2002,
which
is
a
little
bit
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
they
had
this
right
all
along.
they
just,
in
18
months
of
negotiating
history,
never
mentioned
that
they
thought
they
owned
the
water,
they
were
actually
offering
to
pay
1.7
million.
and
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
tribes,
on
page
4,
says
we
were
at
the
negotiating
table
and
we
never
heard
tarrant
mention
this
right.
and
the
other
thing,
i
do
think
the
water
planning
documents
are
highly
significant
because
not
so
much
louisiana
and
arkansas,
but
oklahoma
and
texas
take
water
planning
very
seriously
because
of
their
prior
appropriation
systems.
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pages
on
the
internet
and
none
of
them
mention
this
right.
again,
they
cited
something
in
their
reply
brief,
but
if
you
go
look
at
it,
it
doesn't
come
close
to
mentioning
a
right
of
subbasin
5.
again,
ironically
it
mentioned
a
portion
of
oklahoma
where
texas
would
have
to
actually
buy
the
water.
we'd
ask
you
to
affirm.
thank
you.
