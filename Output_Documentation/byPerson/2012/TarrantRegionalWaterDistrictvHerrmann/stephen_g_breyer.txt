justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
"no
state
is
entitled
to
more
than
25
percent.
"
it
doesn't
say
--
i
mean
that
language
doesn't
say
what
happens
if
in
fact
there's
a
state
that
because
of
cliffs
or
something
can't
get
the
25
percent
to
which
it
is
entitled.
it
just
doesn't
say
anything
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
does
it
say
something
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
does
that
mean
that
a
state
can,
when
it
can't
get
its
pipeline
to
the
river,
go
into
some
other
state
and
take
the
water
out
of
that
other
state?
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought,
if
that
was
their
intent,
there
would
be
a
mechanism
for
doing
it;
that
you'd
have
some
authority
set
up
by
the
compact
that
would
decide
where,
whether
it's
really
true,
and
how
are
we
supposed
to
do
it,
and
there
is
no
such
mechanism,
rather
if
there
is
such
a
right,
which
it
doesn't
say
anything
about,
it's
left
to
the
state
courts
in
different
states
to
try
to
do
what
is
an
extremely
complex
and
controversial
administrative
job.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
at
all
complex
when
oklahoma
is
going
to
say,
texas,
go
run
the
pipe
to
the
south
of
the
red
river,
and
texas
is
going
to
say,
i'm
sorry,
we
can't
get
there,
there's
too
much
cactus.
and
then
they're
going
to
say,
don't
you
know
that,
in
fact,
when
you
put
your
pipeline
into
oklahoma,
you
are
going
to
be
taking
part
of
the
25
percent
that
belongs
to
us.
and
texas
will
say,
no,
we
aren't.
and
then
we'll
have
to
have
a
way
of
measuring
how
much
goes
into
the
river
at
different
places
and
what
are
all
these
different
pipelines
are
going
to
take
out.
you
understand
what
i'm
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
have
thought
a
mechanism
would
be
set
up
to
do
that
and
there
is
none.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
but
they
do
say
expressly,
and
i
don't
know
what
the
terrain
is
like
in
the
other
areas.
and
here
it
does
not
say
anything
about
it.
that's
why
i
think
we're
here
in
the
court,
because
all
it
says
is
you
can't
take
more
than
25
percent.
it
doesn't
say
what
happens
when
texas
is
unable
to
get
its
25
percent
from
the
south.
i'm
now
repeating
myself,
but
you
point
to
the
language
that
says
what
i
just
say
is
not
consistent
with
the
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
language
is
it
not
consistent
with?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
go
back
to
the
first
one,
because
what
you
have
done
is
you've
pushed
me
back
to
the
equal
rights.
and
now
if
i
am
going
to
fight
you
on
it,
i
have
to
say
the
equal
rights
to
water
means
equal
rights
to
water
arising
within
its
boundaries.
and
all
you
have
to
say
is
equal
rights
to
water
arising
anywhere
in
the
subbasin.
and
if
i
just
heard
that,
then
i
might
say
okay,
i
think
yours
is
a
little
better.
but
--
but
we
have
this
enormous
administrative
mess
that
would
seem
to
be
created,
and
both
those
interpretations
seem
possible.
so
let's
go
back
to
that
and
let
me
hear
quite
clearly,
now
that
i've
focused
it:
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
we're
only
considering
the
instance
where
there
isn't
enough
water
to
meet
the
25
percent
in
texas.
and
in
that
instance,
i
guess
there
are
50,000
places,
not
just
in
oklahoma,
but
also
in
arkansas,
where
they
might
get
some.
and
all
my
question,
and
i
think
that
was
being
asked,
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
say
as
to
why
that's
an
easy
matter
to
decide?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
was
a
point,
it
seems
to
me,
to
favor
them,
which
is
go
back
to
1970
--
the
'70s,
when
they
drafted
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
they
are
in
the
room,
and
there
are
representatives
of
all
four
states,
and
as
they
argue,
there
is
going
to
be
more
than
3,000
feet,
what
happens?
and
louisiana
would
say,
we
want
at
least
25
percent;
done.
arkansas,
25
percent;
done.
oklahoma,
same;
done.
texas,
same;
done.
but
everybody
in
the
room
knows
that
texas
could
never
get
more
than
12
percent
within
its
borders.
and
since
it
could
never
get
12
--
more
than
12
percent,
louisiana
would
be
sitting
there
with
not
really
25
percent
but
with
38.
and
so
--
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
would
suggest
that,
hey,
no,
they
all
knew
this
and
so
they
meant
there
must
be
some
way
for
texas
to
get
the
extra;
otherwise,
why
were
they
saying
25
percent
for
texas?
if--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
know,
this
is
an
example
i
made
up,
because
i
think--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--an
imaginary
conversation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
in
an
imaginary
conversation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wouldn't
that
be
a
fairly
easy
thing
to
check
going
back
to
1970--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
found
out
whether,
you
know,
texas
was
just
on
some
little
salt
flat--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--near
the
river
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
subbasin
1,
that's
mostly
in
oklahoma,
but
texas
gets
a
lot
of
the
water
or
the
other
way
around?
it
looked
to
me
like
subbasin
1's
in
oklahoma.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
subbasin
1.
it
says
subbasin
1.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
401.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
get
it.
anyway--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
of
that
and
because
during
the
time
when,
let's
say,
there's
5,000
feet
of
the
--
of
the
2,000
extra,
you
know,
louisiana
has
to
get
500.
okay.
how
do
they
know
whether
they're
getting
it?
i
mean,
how
--
there
must
be
some
system
of
measurement
going
on
or
how
does
this
all
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
so
--
in
other
words--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--fine.
so
that
--
i
don't
know
how
that
cuts,
because
certainly
the
people
who
drew
this
must
have
thought
at
least
in
those
other
provisions
they
are
going
to
develop
a
measurement
system
in
case
of
controversy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
relevant
legal
argument,
i
think,
is
look
at
what
you
just
cited
to
us
about
this
reach
in
the
subbasin.
60
percent
goes
to
texas,
40
percent
to
oklahoma.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
they've
never
measured
it.
that's
because
they
never
fought
about
it,
i
guess.
and
now
we
have
a
fight.
so
why
is
it
any
easier
to
develop
the
necessary
measuring
system
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--than
it
would
be
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
argues
against
you
because
your
main
point,
really,
is
that
this
is
all
too
complicated.
