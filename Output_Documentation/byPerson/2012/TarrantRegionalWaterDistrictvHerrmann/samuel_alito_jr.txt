justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
you
say
texas
has
the
right
to
go
into
oklahoma,
just
--
just
think
about
that
phrase.
that's
--
that's
very
striking.
i
mean,
it
sounds
like
they
are
going
to
send
in
the
national
guard
or
the
texas
rangers.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
were
saying
that
oklahoma
--
that
texas
has
the
right
to
force
oklahoma
to
take
private
property
in
oklahoma
by
eminent
domain
if
necessary.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
if
--
if
you're
correct,
wouldn't
the
oklahoma
board
have
to
give
priority
to
the
texas
applicants
in
order
to
make
sure
that
texas
got
its
share
of
the
water?
it
couldn't
just
treat
--
it
couldn't
just
be
indifferent
as
to
whether
it
was
an
oklahoma
or
texas
applicant.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
is
it
correct
that
--
that
there
are
reservoirs
in
texas
that
flow
into
--
from
which
water
is
released
into
the
red
river?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
and--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
what
if
texas
didn't
--
what
if
texas
could
get
--
could
--
could
release
that
water
and
increase
the
flow
of
the
river,
but
it
chose
not
to
do
so,
so
it
could
take
other
water
out
of
the
river?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes.
