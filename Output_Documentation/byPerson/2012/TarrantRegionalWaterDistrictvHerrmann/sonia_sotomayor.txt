excuse
me.
justice

sotomayor
no,
no.
finish.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
under
your
argument,
and
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
louisiana
could
decide
it
doesn't
want
to
wait
for
the
flow
of
water
to
come
to
it,
and
it
could
just
go
right
into
oklahoma,
in
which
it
shares
no
border,
and
i
don't
know
how
it's
going
to
do
that,
and
take
its
25
percent.
does
that
make
sense
in
terms
of
the
language?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
texas,
but
texas
shares
a
border
and
so
it
may
be
a
little
easier
to
cross
the
borderline.
but
what's
louisiana
going
to
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
i'm
sure
--
you're
--
you're
saying
that
the
state
of
texas
can
take
water
directly
from
the
main
stem?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
my
point,
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
you
think
is
the
remedy?
meaning--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
--
let
me
just
posit
the
point;
okay?
i
understand
your
point
to
the
chief
that
there's
been
no
proof
that
texas
doesn't
get
its
25
percent
or
that
it
couldn't
get
it
from
the
main
stem
or
somewhere.
i
accept
that.
but
let's,
for
the
hypothetical,
say
that
there's
a
major
drought
and
texas
can't
get
it
from
its
portion.
what's
its
remedy?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
--
that
it's
not
getting--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--25
percent--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--as
the
compact
entitles
it
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
says
"shall
have
equal
rights
to
the
use
of
runoff
originating
in
subbasin
5.
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
you
deal
with
all
the
provisions
she
was
mentioning
with
respect
to
the
60/40
division?
i
can't
make
rhyme
or
reason
of
those
provisions
that
don't
use
within
state
boundaries,
but
it
has
to
mean
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
red
river
is
an
important
geographic
feature
of
the
southwest.
both
it
and
its
tributaries
are
critical
sources
of
waters
for
communities
across
four
states.
since
1980,
the
red
river
compact,
a
congressionally
sanctioned
agreement
among
the
states
of
oklahoma,
texas,
arkansas,
and
louisiana,
has
--
has
governed
the
allocation
of
water
within
the
red
river
basin.
the
region,
the
compact
governs
is
divided
into
five
geographic
areas
called
“reaches,”
and
each
reach
is
further
subdivided
into
smaller
subbasins.
the
case
before
us
today
deals
with
water
rights
within
subbasin
5
of
reach
ii
which
covers
portions
of
all
four
states.
petitioner
tarrant
regional
water
district
is
a
texas
state
agency
responsible
for
supplying
water
to
several
cities
located
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
state.
a
population
boom
coupled
with
a
devastating
drought
has
substantially
increased
texas'
need
for
water.
and
so
for
years,
tarrant
have
been
trying
to
locate
suitable
sources
of
potable
water.
as
part
of
its
efforts
from
2000
to
2002,
tarrant
attempted
to
purchase
water
from
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
some
other
parties,
but
these
negotiations
proved
unsuccessful.
in
2007,
tarrant
applied
for
a
water
permit
to
the
oklahoma
water
resources
board,
the
owrb,
the
respondents
here.
tarrant
sought
to
divert
water
from
a
tributary
of
the
red
base
--
red
river
located
in
oklahoma's
portion
of
subbasin
5
of
reach
ii
of
the
compact.
however,
tarrant
was
concern
that
a
package
of
oklahoma
laws
which
plays
restrict
--
which
plays
conditions
on
the
out
of
state
export
of
water
which
wore
its
application.
consequently,
tarrant
also
file
a
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
these
oklahoma
laws
conflict
with
the
compact's
water
allocation
and
are
therefore
preempted
by
it.
i
think
every
student
in
the
audience
is
going
to
look
up
the
word
preempted
today.
tarrant
also
argued
in
the
alternative
that
the
oklahoma
water
laws
violate
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
respondents
on
both
of
tarrant's
claims
and
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
its
judgment.
we
granted
tarrant's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
now
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit.
tarrant's
preemption
argument
centers
on
section
5.05
(b)(1)
of
the
compact
which
governs
the
distribution
of
water
within
subbasin
5
during
times
of
normal
flow.
in
such
circumstances,
(b)(1)
provides
that
each
of
the
“signature
states
shall
have
equal
rights
to
the
use
of
runoff
originating
in
subbasin
5
and
undesignated
water
following
--
flowing
--
following
into
subbasin
5,
so
long
as
the
flow
of
the
red
river
at
the
arkansas-louisiana
state
boundary
is
3,000
cubic
feet
per
second
or
more,
provided
no
state
is
entitled
to
more
than
25%
of
the
water
in
excess
of
3,000
cubic
feet
per
second.”
in
other
words,
a
minimum
flow
of
water,
3000
cubic
feet
per
second
must
be
allowed
to
reach
louisiana,
but
above
this
level
of
flow,
each
state
is
entitled
to
use
up
to
25%
of
water
in
subbasin
5.
tarrant
contends
that
(b)(1)
silence
with
respect
to
the
role
of
state
boarders
in
allocating
water
rights
means
that
subbasin
5
must
be
treated
as
something
of
a
borderless
common
in
which
each
of
the
four
signature
states
may
cross
each
others
boundaries
to
access
a
shared
pool
of
water.
whether
the
compact
preempts
the
oklahoma
water
statute
depends
on
the
meaning
of
this
silence
because
the
red
river
compact
is
at
core,
a
contract
among
its
signature
--
signatory
states.
we
construe
it
under
the
principles
of
contract
law
and
seek
to
ascertain
to
intent
of
the
parties
who
agreed
to
it.
applying
these
principles
to
the
compact,
three
things
persuade
us
that
tarrant's
reading
of
(b)(1)'s
ambiguous
silence
is
wrong.
the
first
is
that
our
jurisprudence
has
long
recognized
that
the
states
do
not
easily
or
quietly
cede
their
sovereign
powers
including
their
control
over
the
waters
within
their
border.
accordingly,
when
confronted
with
silence
and
compacts
touching
on
the
states'
authority
to
control
their
waters,
we
have
previously
stated
that
if
any
inference
at
all
is
to
be
drawn
from
such
silence
on
the
subject
of
regular
authority,
we
think
it
is
that
each
state
was
left
to
regulate
the
activities
of
her
own
citizens.
tarrant's
position
asked
us
to
infer
that
the
signatory
states
silently
dispense
with
the
core
state
prerogative
to
control
waters
within
their
own
boundaries.
but
we
think
that
(b)(1)
silence
is
best
understood
to
indicate
that
the
contracting
parties
drafted
the
compact
with
this
legal
background
in
mind
and
therefore,
did
not
intent
to
grant
each
other
cross
border
rights
under
the
compact.
indeed,
the
drafting
of
other
interstate
water
compacts,
many
of
which
specifically
provide
for
any
cross
border
rights
is
a
second
factor
that
tips
against
tarrant's
reading.
this
customary
practice
of
explicitly
including
cross
border
rights
and
providing
for
the
mechanics
of
managing
any
cross
border
diversions
of
water
means
that
the
present
compact
silence
regarding
state
borders
is
best
understood
as
an
indication
that
the
parties
to
the
compact
never
intended
to
provide
for
any
cross
border
rights.
finally,
the
party's
course
of
performance
under
the
contract
also
count
against
tarrant's
position.
tarrant
attempts
to
purchase
water
from
oklahoma
over
the
course
of
2000
until
2002
was
a
strange
move
if
tarrant
believed
it
was
entitled
to
demand
such
water
without
payment
under
the
compact.
prior
to
tarrant's
suit,
none
of
the
signatories
to
the
compact
ever
pressed
for
such
a
right.
and
so
again,
the
implication
is
that
(b)(1)
silence
was
not
intended
to
create
any
cross
border
rights.
in
some,
we
conclude
that
(b)(1)
cannot
be
read
to
create
a
cross
border
right
in
the
compact's
signatory
and
so
tarrant's
argument
that
oklahoma's
water
laws
conflict
with
the
compact
must
fail.
this
brings
us
to
tarrant's
other
argument
that
the
compact
violates
the
dormant
commerce
clause
by
impermissibly
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce'
for
the
forbidden
purpose
of
favoring
local
interest
by
creating
barriers
to
the
distribution
of
water
left
unallocated
under
the
compact.
but
tarrant's
arguments
rest
on
the
assumption
that
a
substantial
amount
of
reach
ii
subbasin
5
water
located
in
oklahoma
is
not
a
portion
to
any
state
and
therefore
is
available
to
permit
applicants
like
it.
that
assumption
is
incorrect.
the
interpretive
comment
for
the
compact
makes
clear
but
during
periods
of
normal
flow,
all
states
are
free
to
use
whatever
amount
of
waters
they
can
put
to
beneficial
use.
subject
to
the
requirement
that
if
the
states
have
competing
uses
and
the
amount
of
water
available
and
excess
of
3000
cubic
feet
per
second
cannot
satisfy
all
such
uses.
each
state
will
utter
the
others
right
to
25%
of
the
excess
flow.
this
means
that
if
more
than
25%
of
subbasin's
5
waters
is
located
in
oklahoma,
that
water
is
not
unallocated
as
tarrant
assumes,
rather
it
is
allocated
to
oklahoma
unless
and
until
another
state
calls
for
an
accounting
and
oklahoma
is
asked
to
reframe
from
utilizing
more
than
it's
entitled
share.
the
oklahoma
water
statutes
cannot
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
in
any
unallocated
water
because
the
compact
leaves
no
water
unallocated.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
is
affirmed.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
