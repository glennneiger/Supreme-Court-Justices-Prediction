justice
elena
kagan
and
what
does
that
mean
exactly?
what
would
oklahoma
do
to
evaluate
that
application
and
to
compare
it
to
other
applications
from
oklahomans,
and
also
maybe
to
compare
it
--
maybe
there
is
more
than
one
texas
application.
how
does
the
oklahoma
board
make
those
decisions?
justice
elena
kagan
i'm
really
asking
you
to
tell
me
what
the
oklahoma
board
is
going
to
do.
i
mean,
why
doesn't
the
oklahoma
board
just
say,
you
know,
sorry,
we
like
oklahomans?
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
elena
kagan
what
--
what
--
what
different
kind
of
priorities
do
they
have
to
use,
and
why
do
they
have
to
use
them,
as
i
think
--
somewhere
along
the
lines
of
what
the
chief
justice
was
asking?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
o'connell,
isn't
that
a
reason
why
we
shouldn't
accept
your
basic
view?
i
mean,
if
--
if
you
think
of
all
the
issues
that
you
laid
out
that
are
going
to
have
to
be
decided
and
the
difficulty
of
those
issues
--
i
mean,
you
read
this
brief
that
you
submitted,
it
gives
you
kind
of
a
headache.
that
--
that
--
you
know,
and
it
--
it
suggests
how
difficult
the
process
is.
and
then
you
look
at
this
provision,
and
maybe
this
provision
can
be
read
as
an
entitlement,
but
it
can
just
as
easily,
as
--
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
be
read
as
a
cap,
“
no
more
than
25
percent
”.
so
as
between
those
two
possible
readings,
the
complexity
of
your
way
of
reading
this,
which
would
have
--
why?
justice
elena
kagan
and
what
does
that
mean?
what
would
oklahoma
do?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
people
keep
on
saying
that,
and
i
--
i
guess
i
just
still
don't
understand
quite
what
it
means.
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
let's
say
oklahoma,
the
board
is
sitting
there
and
it
gets
lots
of
applications
from
oklahoma
users.
and
let's
say
it
also
gets
multiple
applications
from
texas
users.
that
it's
not
just
one
county,
it's
four
counties.
what
does
oklahoma
do
to
--
to
decide
who
gets
the
water?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
blatt,
the
solicitor
general
here
today
spoke
of
lots
of
different
examples
where
the
language
of
entitlement
and
rights
was
used.
do
you
have
a
view
as
--
as
to
that?
