chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
11-889,
tarrant
regional
water
district
v.
herrmann.
mr.
rothfeld?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
--
how
does
oklahoma
apply
its
law
in
this
situation?
i
assume
there
is
normal
priorities
and
they
will
get
applications
from
a
lot
of
people.
but
they
have
to
--
what
do
they
have
to
give
texas?
up
to
25
percent?
i
mean,
they
can't
just
say
--
deny
it,
because
another
oklahoma
user
has
priority,
or
all
this.
how
does
that
fit
in
with
the
existing
administrative
structure?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it's
got
to
give
texas
at
least
up
to
its
25
percent,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
what
i'm
asking
is,
does
the
compact
give
texas
special
priority
apart
from
what
oklahoma
--
oklahoma's
priorities
would
be?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
o'connell.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
where,
if
you're
relying
on
the
compact
and
its
language,
where
do
you
come
up
with
this
idea
that
states
first
have
to
try
to
get
their
25
percent
from
water
within
their
borders?
i
don't
see
that
anywhere.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
like
some
provisions
of
state
law,
but
not
others.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
--
what
do
you
do
with
a
situation
--
let's
say
there's
oklahoma
water
available
to
tarrant
that
is
closer
than
the
water
they
would
get
from
somewhere
else
in
texas.
do
they
have
to
incur
the
additional
expense
to
get
texas
water,
or
can
they
take
the
cheaper
route
and
get
oklahoma
water?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
blatt?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
they
licensed?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
anywhere
close
to
of
the
25
percent
they
claim
entitlement
to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
was
hoping
you
did.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
subbasin
5.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
texans.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
never
--
it
never
says
that.
i
mean,
that's
why
we
have
a
case.
it
never
says
it
has
to
be
from
your
state.
and
i
appreciate
your
--
the
focus
in
your
argument
on
state
sovereignty,
but
this
is
an
interstate
compact.
and
the
whole
point
of
interstate
compacts
is
that
we
have
to
--
each
state
has
to
give
up
a
little
here
or
a
little
there
to
solve
a
problem.
so
i
--
i
guess
it's
--
i
don't
know
why
these
basic
principles
of
state
sovereignty
apply
in
the
context
of
an
interstate
compact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
feel
a
lot
of
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
are
representing
oklahoma.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that's
the
same
problem.
even
if
you
take
within
state,
all
of
these
people,
if
they
were
applying
for
water
in
texas
as
well,
there'd
be
the
same
issue
there.
one
of
them
would
beat
the
other
one.
it's
a
question
of
priority.
you're
just
claiming
that
everybody
from
oklahoma
should
have
--
well,
not
absolute
priority,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
thought
that
was
what
your
--
the
other
side
does
envision,
that
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
bound
by
the
borders
but
it's
bound
by
the
agreement,
the
compact.
compacts
compromise
the
individual
state
sovereignty.
that's
the
whole
point
of
them.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-889,
tarrant
regional
water
district
versus
herrmann.
