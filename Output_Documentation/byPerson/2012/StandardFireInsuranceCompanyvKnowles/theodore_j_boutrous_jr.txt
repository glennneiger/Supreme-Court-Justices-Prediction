mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
class
action
fairness
act
of
2005,
cafa,
to
expand
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
and
to
protect
defendants
and
absent
class
members
against
the
kind
of
state
court
class
action
abuses
that
are
occurring
in
miller
county,
arkansas.
congress
directed
that
in
calculating
the
amount
in
controversy,
"courts
shall
aggregate
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
members.
"
that's
28
u.s.c.
section
1332(d)(6),
quoted
in
full
at
page
2
of
our
blue
brief.
congress's
express
focus
on
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
members
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
rather
than
on
the
amount
being
sought
by
the
would-be
class
representative,
is
dispositive
of
the
question
presented
and
requires
reversal
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
we
are
not
arguing
that
here.
there
are
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
going
back
to
barry
v.
edmunds
in
1886
where
there
are
allegations
in
a
complaint
that
might,
for
example,
yield
a
punitive
damage
claim
but
it's
not
explicitly
pled,
and
the
courts
then
look
and
say:
punitive
damages
could
be
recovered
here
and
say
the
amount
in
controversy
clearly
exceeds
the
--
the
necessary
amount.
but
we're
not
saying
that
in
every
case
the
courts
need
to
look
through
and
see
every
claim
that
could
be
in
play.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
that's
really
how
it's
been
done,
your
honor,
from
day
one.
under
the
traditional
diversity
statute,
the
courts
look
and
see
what's
the
maximum
amount
the
plaintiff
on
his
or
her
best
day
could
recover
based
on
the
factual
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
the
causes
of
action
that
could
arise
from
the
factual
allegations--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
individual--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--i
don't
want
you
to
apply
that
rule,
your
honor,
because
that
rule
applies
to
the
individual
who
brings
his
own
case
in
court
and
can
say:
i
want
to
come
into
court
and
collect
less
than
the
amount
that
would
give
federal
jurisdiction.
it's
much
different
when
mr.
knowles
has
come
to
court
and
said:
i
want
to
represent
these
other
individuals
in
arkansas.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
it
wouldn't
protect
it
--
protect
from
the
problems
and
abuses
that
congress
was
concerned
about,
your
honor,
and
that
are
occurring
here.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
it
could
be,
your
honor.
and
another
class
representative
could
come
in
and
could
seek
more
than
$5
million.
that's
why--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--but
what
congress
was
concerned
about
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
the
senate
report
makes
this
very
clear,
that
with
all
the
abuses
that
occur
in
the
interim,
discovery
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
--
the
discovery
here
goes
back
10
years.
the
--
this
case--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--your
honor
--
excuse
me.
the
congress
was
very
concerned
that
cases
were
being
kept
in
the
state
courts
through
abuses
and
manipulations
of
the
amount
in
controversy.
it's
very
clear
in
the
senate
report,
congress
talks
about
this
because,
for
example,
in
this
case
the
defendants
can
never
get
a
class
certification
hearing
in
miller
county.
they
could
never
get
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
and
in
the
meantime,
the
kind
of
abuses
that
congress
was
concerned
about,
the
lack
of
the
rule
23
protection,
the
application
of
those
standards
to
protect
the
class
members--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
the
text
does
take
away
the
st.
paul
rule
that
an
individual
can
control
what
he
seeks
and
go
where
he
desires
and
do
what
he
wants,
or
she,
because
it
points
to
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
members
and
the
text
congress
could
expect--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
i
would
answer
you
that
it's
worth
as
much
as
i
can
possibly
obtain
in
court
if
i
was
seeking
to
adequately
represent
the
class.
but
in
terms
of
valuing
the
claims
here--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--your
honor,
we've
cited
the
tohono
o'odham
nation
case,
where
the
court
interpreted
the
word
“
claim
”
and
said
when
a
statute
uses
the
word
“
claim
”
regarding
claims
that
have
not
been
brought,
it's
the
operative
facts
and
the
right
to
recovery,
not
the
demand.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
absolutely
right.
and
because
the
statute
focuses
on
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
members,
mr.
knowles
has
no
power
to
affect
those
claims.
he's
not
the
master--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--exactly.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
that's
--
smith
v.
bayer
says
the
plaintiff
can't
bind
the
class.
plaintiffs
have
now
conceded
that.
so
what
we
have
here,
the
district
court
found
on
an
uncontradicted
record
that
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
members
exceed
$5
million.
that
means
there's
federal
jurisdiction.
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
point,
that
is
exactly
our
point,
your
honor.
a
named
plaintiff
cannot
affect
or
jeopardize
or
undermine
the
claims
of
absent
individuals.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
yes.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
it's
the
other
part
that
is
extremely
important,
section
1332(d)(6).
you
were
quoting
from
section
1332(d)(2).
unlike
section
1332(a),
congress
in
cafa
explicitly
added
subsection
(6),
which
says
"in
any
class
action,
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
member
shall
be
aggregated
to
determine--
"
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--well,
justice
breyer,
congress
could
have
said
we're
just
getting
rid
of
zahn,
or
it
could
have
said
the
aggregate
amount
being
sought
by
the
named
plaintiff
is
going
to
take
control.
but
if
you
took
that
away--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--it's
really
not
the
word
“
aggregation
”,
your
honor.
it's
the
word
“
individual
”
and
it's
with
the
word
“
claims
”.
if
congress
had
done
what
you
are
suggesting,
justice
breyer,
it
could
have
said
the
aggregate
amount
being
sought
by
the
named
plaintiff,
or
the
total
amount,
or
the
demand
of
the
plaintiff.
in
the
venue
clarification
act,
which
was
passed
in
2011,
which
applies
to
1332(a),
congress
said
the
sum
demanded
will
control.
but
here,
to
protect
the
legitimate
claims,
congress
defining,
i
urged
the
court--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--your
honor,
it
really
goes
to
a
fundamental
issue
of
what
a
class
action
is.
if
mr.
knowles
had
come
into
court
himself
on
behalf
of
himself,
and
zahn
--
in
st.
paul,
the
money
quote,
if
you
will,
in
st.
paul
says
"if
he
desires
to
go
to
state
court,
he
can
limit
his
recovery.
"
mr.
knowles--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--we
don't
stop
them
from
doing
all
of
those
things,
your
honor.
and
there
are
certain
things
--
we
--
we
agree
that
the
complaint
controls
a
great
deal
--
the
factual
allegations.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
you
could.
and
i
believe
that
the
court's
decision
in
hertz
said
if
there
is
a
sign
of
manipulation
that
is
meant
to
thwart
jurisdiction
or
affect
jurisdiction,
the
court
can
look
through
that
to
look
to
competent
proof
of
what
the
actual
facts
are.
and
i
think
that
what
has
happened
here
is
the
plaintiff's
lawyers,
in
addition
to
these
stipulations,
they're
slicing
and
dicing
the
classes
up
into
pieces
to
thwart
jurisdiction
and
manipulate
jurisdiction.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
it's
an
unusual
position
to
be
in,
your
honor,
it's
not
quite
what
we're
arguing.
we're
arguing
that
under
the
rules
for
judging
the
amount
in
controversy
that
this
court
has
enforced,
the
lower
courts
have
enforced
these
for
hundreds
of
years,
and
it's
that
you
look
at
the
complaint
and
say
what's
the
maximum
amount
the
plaintiff
can
get
on
their
best
day
under
the
claims
they've
pled
based
on
the
facts
and
the
proof
and
the
evidence.
here,
the
uncontradicted
evidence,
put
aside
the
statute
of
limitations
question
or
any
other
claim
they
could
have
brought,
it
exceeds
$5
million.
the
plaintiff
never--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--that's
--
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
there's
greater
leeway
under
cafa
because
under
1332(a)
and
1446,
there
are
certain
standards
that
need
to
be
met
to
allow
the
defendant
to
put
on
proof.
but
that's
how
it's
always
been.
the
defendant
can
then
put
on
evidence
and
say
this
is
the
actual
amount
in
controversy.
and
here,
the
only
way
the
plaintiff
got
around
it
in
the
lower
courts
was
to
argue
that
the
stipulation
was
binding,
justice
kagan,
that
was
their
argument
below
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
it
found
that
the
stipulation
was
binding
on
the
class.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
and
that
means
that
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
exists,
because
we
judge
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
removal.
and
at
the
time
of
removal,
there
was
no
binding
limitation
on
the
recovery
that
could
be
obtained,
undisputed
facts
showed
that
that
exceeds
$5
million
when
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
members
are
aggregated.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
the
problem,
your
honor,
again
and
this
isn't
just
me.
this
is
what
congress
said
in
its
findings.
in
--
in
the
text
as
you
noted,
it
eliminated
the
the
five
pillars
of
restrictions
and
diversity
jurisdiction
because
in
state
courts,
the
courts
aren't
applying
rule
23
like
standards.
they're
not
doing
it
in
miller
county.
they're
not
even
allowing
class
certification
to
occur
or
to
be
heard,
and
instead
this
discovery
is
being
taken.
here,
the
limitations
period
is
limited
to
two
--
or
the
class
period
is
limited
to
two
years.
the
discovery
that
was
served
with
the
complaint
goes
back
to
13
years.
so--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--that's
--
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
that's
something
page
3a
of
the
addendum
to
our
opening
brief,
the
finding--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--well,
that's
what
congress
was
concerned
about,
too,
your
honor.
it
was
concerned
that
the
state
courts
weren't
applying
standards
of
uniformity
in
these
class
actions
that
are
affecting
interstate
commerce
and
that
rule
23's
protections
and
standards
should
apply.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
we
don't
have
a
state
court
judgment
yet,
your
honor,
that
--
and
we
judge
the
removal
issues
and
the
amount
in
controversy
at
the
time
of
removal.
and
$5
million
is
$5
million,
congress
drew
the
line
there.
and
as
justice
alito
was
pointing
out,
the
notices
to
the
absent
class
members,
congress
--
i
was
about
to
say
3a
of
the
addendum
to
our
blue
brief,
those
are
the
findings
that
congress
put
into
the
public
law,
number
--
letter
c:
confusing
notices
are
published
that
prevent
individuals
from
exercising
their
legitimate
rights
in
--
and
enforcing
their
legitimate
claims.
and
it
would
be
ironic
in
the
extreme
if
a
--
where
a
statute
was
enacted
to
protect
--
and
this
is
in
the
findings
--
"legitimate
claims
of
absent
class
members.
"
and
to
allow
them
--
the
cases
to
be
in
federal
court,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
a
named
plaintiff
who
doesn't
represent
those
people
can
come
into
court
and
--
and
say
we're
not
going
to
seek
the
full
amount
of
those
claims
in
order
to
keep
the
case
out
of
federal
court.
that
would
be
totally
contrary
to
congress's
intent.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
i'm
not
making
a
judgment
on
that
point,
your
honor.
it
may
or
may
not
be,
and
the
plaintiff
makes
this
point.
maybe
it's
better
to
be
in
state
court.
but
for
removal
purposes
only,
going
back
to
just
the
pure
analysis,
the
question
is
does
the
amount
in
controversy
when
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
members
are
aggregated
exceed
$5
million?
it's
undisputed
that
that's
true.
the
only
basis
for
saying
it
doesn't
exceed
that
amount
is
the
stipulation,
which
everyone
now
agrees
has
no
binding
affect
whatsoever.
the
plaintiffs
also
argue,
concede
in
their
brief
that--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--but
the
question,
your
honor,
is,
is
it
binding
in
this
case
on
anybody
or
anything
other
than
mr.
knowles?
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
but,
your
honor,
again,
under
the
jurisdictional
approach
--
and
your
honor
cited
st.
paul.
st.
paul
says
that
if
--
once
the
amount
in
controversy
has
been
established
to
exceed
the
amount,
here
$5
million,
it's
on
the
burden
of
the
parties
seeking
to
oust
jurisdiction
to
show
to
a
legal
certainty
that
the
amount
will
not
go
over
$5
million.
your
questions
and
the
plaintiff's
brief
concede
it
could
well
go
over
$5
million
if
this
class
representative
is
found
inadequate,
if
another
person
is
appointed
to
be
the
class
representative,
and
therefore,
there
is
federal
jurisdiction.
that's
the
rule
that
plaintiffs
say
should
apply.
they
don't
even
--
he
does
not
even
try
to
suggest
that
it's
legally
impossible
that
the
amount
might
go
over
$5
million,
and
that's
the
problem.
it's
going
--
it's
an
amount
that
is
over
$5
million
and
these
cases,
the
--
the
stipulation
is
meant
to
just
keep
the
case
in
state
court,
contrary
to
congress's
intent
and
i
will--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--that's
--
that's
what
we're
using,
your
honor,
for
our
calculations,
the
proposed
class,
including
the
narrower
time
frame
that
we
think
is
a
manipulation,
but
nevertheless
we've
used
that
and
the
amount
exceeds
$5
million.
and
if
i
could
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor?
thank
you.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
let
me
just
start
with
the
concerns
that
i
have
and
i
think
they're
best
expressed
and
encapsulated
in
two
of
the
friend-of-the-court
briefs,
the
manufactured
housing
institute
brief
and
the
21st
century
brief.
they
explain
what
has
been
happening
in
miller
county.
it's
not
speedy
justice.
it
takes
five
or
six
years
to
get
a
hearing
on
anything
and
then
there's
no
hearing,
even
on
class
certification.
and
that's
why,
justice
kagan,
it's
cold
cold
comfort
to
maybe
somebody
day
the
court
will
find
this
is
an
inadequate
class
member
or
class
representative.
it
does
not
solve
the
problem
that
congress
sought
to
address.
with
respect
to
mr.
fredrick's
suggestion
that
this
stipulation
is
binding
in
this
case
forever
and
all-time
on
anybody
who's
in
the
case,
his
own
brief
on
page
41
says:
it
might
well
be
that
another
class
representative
might
get
appointed
and
the
stipulation
might
be
invalidated
because
it's
an
unfair
stipulation
and
not
valid
for
the
class.
that
new
class
representative
could
come
in
and
say:
we
are
not
going
to
be
bound
by
this
$5
million
number.
that's
not
the
amount
in
controversy.
mr.

well,
it
theoretically
could
be,
your
honor,
but
that
won't
solve
the
problem
of
discovery.
if
it
goes
back
ten
years
in
a
case
that's
supposed
to
be
about
two
years.
it
won't
solve
the
problem
of--
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
--that's
incorrect,
your
honor.
first,
congress
knew
what
was
going
on
in
state
courts
and
wanted
swift
removal
in
a
simple
way
for
defendants
to
protect
defendants
and
absent
class
members
because
it
knew
what
was
going
on.
there
wasn't
these
protections.
the
federal
rules
provide
protection
against
discovery.
this
court
said
--
one
of
the
reasons
is
speedy
motion
to
dismiss,
and
a
strong
standard
is
necessary
as
to
avoid
discovery
that
is
burdensome,
that
coerces
settlements
that
don't
relate
to
the
merits.
so
congress
knew
it
was
bringing
cases
into
the
federal
system
for
precisely
that
reason.
and
on
this
master
of
complaint
point,
mr.
frederick
is
simply
incorrect
on
this
point.
st.
paul
wasn't
a
master
of
the
complaint
case,
it
said
the
plaintiff
can
limit
the
amount
that
he
wants
to
seek.
the
master
of
the
complaint
doctrine
has
never,
ever
been
applied
by
this
court
where
an
unappointed
named
plaintiff,
who's
not
been
appointed
to
represent
people,
seeks
to
try
to
alter
the
claims
and
judgments
of
other
people
and
the
rights
of
them
to
recover.
it's
usually
been
applied
in
the
arising
under
contexts.
where
the
court
has
said
if
a
plaintiff
wants
to
bring
a
state
claim,
they
can.
we
are
not
going
to
force
them
to
bring
a
federal
claim.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
your
honor,
on
the
amount
in
controversy,
this
court
has
never
held
in
a
class
action
or
otherwise
that
that's
something
that's
subject
to
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule
or
the
master
of
the
complaint
doctrine.
the
court
in
the
hertz
case
and
in
the
mcnutt
case,
which
it
cites,
said
the
court
should
look
past
what
the
pleadings
say.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
no,
your
honor.
may
i
answer,
your
honor?
mr.
theodore
j.
boutrous
jr.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
same
rules
on
this
score
that
the
court
has
always
applied,
that
when
the
complaint
claims
one
amount,
the
defendant
can
bring
forth
proof
that
it's
a
larger
amount,
that
it
exceeds
the
amount
in
controversy
and
the
court
looks
at
the
competent
proof,
that's
the
language
the
court
used
in
the
hertz
case,
to
determine
the
actual
amount
in
controversy,
not
some
jerry-rigged
amount
the
plaintiffs
came
up
with.
thank
you.
