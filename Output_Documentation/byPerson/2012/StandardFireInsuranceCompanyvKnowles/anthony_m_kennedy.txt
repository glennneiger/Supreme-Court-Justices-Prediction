justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
(6)
doesn't
apply
at
this
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
(6)
talks
about
class
action,
and
it
says
the
duty
of
the
district
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
to
aggregate
the
claims
of
the
individual
class
members.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
you're
saying
in
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
--
and
i
don't
think
you've
really
addressed
his
point
--
that
the
statute
number
6
says
“
shall
aggregate
the
individual
claim
”.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
simplest
thing
is
to
evade
the
statute.
evasion
is
simple.
and
therefore,
we
still
use
that
approach,
because
the
simplest
is
the
best.
that
just
is
not
responsive
to
his
question.
