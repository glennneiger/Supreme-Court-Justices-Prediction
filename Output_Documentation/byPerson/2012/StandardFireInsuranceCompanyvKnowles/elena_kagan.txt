justice
elena
kagan
you
say
what
congress
is
concerned
about
and
point
to
the
senate
report.
you
know,
usually
we
look
to
the
text
and
the
text
makes
very
clear
that
congress
was
concerned
about
many
things
and
it
did
many
things.
it
got
--
it
really
--
it
raised
the
matter
in
controversy
threshold.
it
eliminated
the
zahn
anti-aggregation
rule.
it
eliminated
the
complete
diversity
requirement.
it
eliminated
the
one-year
limit
on
removal.
here's
one
thing
it
didn't
eliminate.
it
didn't
eliminate
the
st.
paul
master
of
your
complaint
rule.
so
i
guess
where
in
the
text
do
you
see
this?
you
point
to
claim,
the
word
“
claim
”.
is
that
the
only
thing
that
you
are
resting
on
in
the
text?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
i
said
to
you,
mr.
boutrous
"is
your
claim
for
over
$100,000?
"
what
would
you
think
i
mean?
would
you
think
i
mean
some
sort
of
abstract
version
of
the
best
claim
you
could
bring,
or
would
you
think
i
mean
what
i
demanded,
what
i
asked
for?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
that
the
word
“
claim
”
is
not
--
when
you
say
joe
made
a
claim
for
$100,000,
a
claim
is
not
what
he
asked
for,
but
is
instead
some
kind
of
law
professor's
view
of
what
the
best
thing
that
he
could
have
asked
for?
justice
elena
kagan
but
he
doesn't
have
power
to
affect
those
claims
before
the
certification
has
happened.
justice
elena
kagan
before
the
certification
has
happened,
they
can
do
whatever
they
want.
they
can
bring
their
own
claim
for
$6
million.
and
that's
why
smith
v.
bayer,
which
you
so
happily
rely
on,
does
not
have
much
to
do
with
this
case.
smith
v.
bayer
is
the
question
--
can
a
person
be
precluded
by
a
judgment
when
that
person
was
not
part
of
a
class.
there's
no
question
that
this
person
is
going
to
be
precluded.
this
person
can
go
do
whatever
he
or
she
wants
before
class
certification
and
judgment.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
boutrous,
that
form
of
argument
--
congress
could
have
said
--
does
seem
to
me
to
be
much
worse
for
your
position.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
st.
paul
master
of
your
complaint
rule,
it
could
have
said:
we
are
getting
rid
of
the
st.
paul
master
of
your
complaint
rule.
but
you're
trying
to
find
it
in
a
position
which
is
really
an
anti-zahn
position,
not
an
anti-st.
paul
provision.
justice
elena
kagan
let's
get
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
because
there
are
a
thousand
ways
in
which
we
let
the
named
plaintiff
prior
to
certification
construct
a
case,
and
then
we
ask,
as
justice
sotomayor
said,
later
we
ask,
is
the
way
he's
constructed
a
case
adequate
or
not,
and
we
allow
him
to
go
forward
or
not
based
on
that.
but
he
gets
to
decide
whether
to
seek
damages.
he
gets
--
at
all,
or
whether
he
only
can
seek
injunctive
relief.
he
gets
to
decide
which
claims
to
bring,
trespass
or
negligence.
he
gets
to
decide
how
many
years'
worth
to
ask
for.
he
gets
to
decide
which
defendants
to
sue.
all
of
these
things
are
going
to
have
an
effect
on
--
on
the
amount
that's
--
that's
being
asked
for.
and
yet
in
all
of
these
ways,
we
allow
for
--
maybe
you're
telling
me
no
--
do
we
stop
the
named
plaintiff
from
doing
all
--
all
of
those
things,
too?
justice
elena
kagan
it's
binding
if
the
class
is
certified
and
the
case
proceeds
to
judgment.
it's
not
binding
on
the
absent
class
members
prior
to
certification
and
prior
to
judgment.
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
i
don't
understand
that,
mr.
boutrous,
because
what
you
have,
given
that
this
is
a
state
which
says
that
these
stipulations
are
binding
if
it
proceeds,
if
there's
certification
and
if
it
proceeds
to
judgment,
you
have
a
cap
of
$5
million.
you
cannot
be
charged
more
than
$5
million
under
this
state's
law,
if
this
case
ever
gets
to
judgment.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
congress
was
concerned
about
suits
of
over
$5
million.
and
--
and
the
question
here
is,
is
this
a
suit
of
over
$5
million.
now,
if
it
is
a
suit
over
$5
million,
a
state
court
is
bound
by
the
due
process
clause
and
a
state
court
is
going
to
find,
look,
you're
just
giving
these
plaintiffs'
claims
away.
we're
not
going
to
allow
you
to
do
that.
you're
not
an
adequate
representative.
on
the
other
hand,
in
a
case
like
this
where
it's
$5,024,000
and
it
only
gets
there
because
you've
added
on
one
and
a
half
million
dollars
of
legal
fees,
the
court
might
very
well
say
you
are
an
adequate
representative,
go
for
it.
now,
usually
we
don't
question
state
court
judgments
of
that
kind.
why
should
we
do
so
here?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
boutrous,
as
you
think
--
you
have
to
be
careful
about
two
different
uses
of
the
word
“
binding
”.
it
has
no
binding
effect
right
now
on
an
absent
class
member;
they
can
go
out
and
bring
their
own
suit.
if
the
--
the
named
plaintiff
is
found
to
be
adequate
and
the
suit
goes
forward
and
goes
to
judgment,
then
the
stipulation
does
indeed
have
binding
effect
and
--
and
you
have
not
been
exposed
to
more
than
$5
million.
justice
elena
kagan
it's
binding
--
it
is
binding
on
everybody
if
there's
a
finding
of
adequate
representation
and
if
this
goes
forward
as
a
class
action;
then
it's
binding
and
you
haven't
been
exposed.
justice
elena
kagan
and
they
can
remove
no
matter
when
that
happen;
is
that
right,
as
a
result
of
cafa,
because
cafa
took
off
the
one
year
limit?
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
ask
you
this,
because
i
have
been
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
mr.
boutrous
is
concerned
about?
and
one
thing
he
might
be
concerned
about
is
that,
notwithstanding
that
the
class
has
really
plans
for
$20
million,
the
thing
is
going
to
be
certified
for
$5
million,
and
all
these
absent
class
members
are
--
are
being
deprived
of
something
meaningful
to
them.
but
that's
something
which
--
you
know
usually,
we
assume
that
state
court
judges
will
do
their
jobs,
will
pay
attention
to
the
constitution,
will
apply
adequacy
of
representation
standards
that
come
from
the
due
process
clause.
so
that
seems
like
a
strange
thing
to
worry
about
in
interpreting
this
federal
statute.
the
other
possibility
is
that
you
might
be
worried
that
this
stipulation
won't
be
really
as
binding
as
you
say,
that
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
an
adequacy
of
representation
determination
made,
the
class
goes
forward,
and
then
things
work
out
and
it
really
looks
like
all
these
absent
class
members
are
going
to
get
--
you
know,
badly
treated.
he's
going
to
tear
this
stipulation
up
or
do
something
like
that.
and
it's
going
to
be
way
down
the
line.
and
why
should
we
allow
that
to
happen?
justice
elena
kagan
but
this
is
--
he's
done
the
certification,
now
it
turns
out
that
the
certification
was
wrong,
that
in
fact,
these
claims
are
worth
a
good
deal
more.
and
he
says,
i
can't
in
good
faith
allow
all
these
people's
claims
to
be
adjudicated
for
this
amount
of
money
when
i
know
they're
worth
five
times
as
much.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
boutrous,
you
know,
a
lot
of
your
brief
talks
about
this
problem
of
discovery.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
there
is
a
significant
one,
i
don't
know,
but
when
you
look
at
cafa,
i
mean,
cafa
did
a
lot
of
things.
and
it
did
not
address
this
problem
that
you
have
with
discovery.
there
could
be
--
i
can
give
you,
you
know,
ten
different
proposals
that
would
enable
you
to
bypass
expensive
discovery,
but
cafa
didn't
do
any
of
them.
and
this
is
a
kind
of
a
jerry-rigged
solution
to
get
at
a
problem
that
congress,
in
fact,
did
not
address.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
boutrous,
the
idea
of
master
of
the
complaint
is
inherent
in
every
class
litigation
because
there
could
be
no
class
action,
there
could
be
no
definition
of
anything,
of
the
claims,
of
the
amount
of
damages,
of
the
number
of
defendants,
of
the
amount
of
time
unless
the
plaintiff,
the
named
plaintiff,
had
some
ability
to
define
the
claim.
and
this
is
just
one
aspect
of
that
larger
power.
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
then
you
really
are
asking
us
to
blow
up
the
whole
world.
justice
elena
kagan
because
you're
saying:
next
time
we
will
be
back
and
tell
you
that
the
named
plaintiff
can't
define
the
clans.
next
time
we
are
going
to
be
back
and
tell
you
that
they
can't
name
the
defendants.
