justice
ruth
bader

mr.
boutrous,
i
thought
at
least
as
an
alternative
argument,
you're
saying:
the
statute
itself
is
silent.
it
doesn't
deal
with
this
question
of
amount
in
controversy.
however,
the
individual,
the
named
plaintiff,
who
has
said,
i'm
not
going
to
seek
more
than
the
$5
million,
cannot
speak
for
the
members
of
the
class
who
are
absent.
he
can't
stipulate
that
they
will
take
under
5,000.
i
thought
that
was
the
central
part
of
your
argument,
not
based
on
the
statute
itself,
but
on
the
notion
that
a
named
plaintiff,
unless
and
until
he
is
--
he
is
certified
to
represent
the
class
--
doesn't
represent
them.
he
can
represent
himself,
but
he
can't
bind
the
people
who
--
who
have
not
been
certified
as
part
of
a
class.
i
thought
that
was
part
of
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
specifically
the
question
that
the
chief
asked
about
time?
you
did
argue
in
the
district
court
that
these
plaintiffs
could
have
specified
a
5-year
time
period,
in
which
case
it
would
be
clear
that
the
amount
in
controversy
was
satisfied.
but
instead,
they
took
a
2-year
period.
can
we
take
that
also
into
account
in
determining
the
amount
in
controversy,
that
the
complaint
could
have
been
enlarged
to
include
5
years
instead
of
2
years?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
concern
is
that
the
--
that
the
certification
--
if
the
certification
would
occur
in
the
federal
court,
that's
one
thing.
but
you're
saying
that
the
named
plaintiff
can't
stand
for
the
entire
class
when
we
know
that
--
that
the
certification
question,
if
the
stipulation
is
binding
to
prevent
removal,
it's
going
to
be
the
state
court
that's
going
to
look
into
the
adequacy
of
representation
and
whether
the
stipulation
binds
all
members
of
the
class.
that's
your
whole
concern.
if
the
federal
court
made
that
determination,
i
think
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
--
in
the
language
in
1332(d)(1)(d),
the
term
“
class
members
”
means
the
persons,
named
or
unnamed,
who
fall
within
the
definition
of
the
proposed
class,
the
proposed
class,
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
theory
doesn't
depend
on
it
being
just
a
little
over
$5
million,
the
theory
would
hold
whether
it
was
$8
million,
$9
million.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
you
admit
in
your
brief
--
you
agreed
that
the
stipulation
--
i
didn't
think
that
this
is
what
you
said
on
page
53,
the
stipulations
that
have
no
effect
on
absentees,
until
the
court
finds
at
the
certification
stage
that
the
stipulation
was
made
in
good
faith
and
doesn't
render
the
named
plaintiff
an
inadequate
representative.
but
we
have
to
judge
removal
at
the
time
removal
is
made,
and
at
that
time,
there
is
no
determination
of
class.
so
at
the
removal
stage,
the
stipulation
is
inoperative
as
to
the
non-named
class
members.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
is
it
binding
when
you
said
in
your
brief
it
doesn't
bind
the
unnamed
class
members?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
would
not
come
up
on
your
theory,
because
the
federal
court
would
never
get
the
chance
to
make
that
determination.
it
would
be
made
in
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
would
that
include
the
i'm
suing
for
two
years
when
i
could
have
sued
for
five?
