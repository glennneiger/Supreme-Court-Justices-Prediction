yes,
but
under
the
traditional
--
you
surely
don't
want
us
to
apply
the
rules
of
the
traditional
diversity
statute
to
this
case,
because
it's
clear
that
under
the
traditional
diversity
statute,
you
--
you
can
waive
excessive
damages,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
want
us
to
apply
that
rule
here.
justice

scalia
or
the
state
court
could
find
the
claim
is
worth
a
lot
more
than
5
million
but
it's
worth
that
amount
to
be
in
this
generous
court
for
these
generous
juries.
and
you're
really
not
harming
these
absent
plaintiffs
because
they
ought
to
want
to
be
here.
we've
got
juries
and
very
favorable
judges.
couldn't
they
find
that?
justice

scalia
i
understand
it,
but
--
but
i'm
just
addressing
your
point
which
you
blithely
say,
if
the
representation
is
inadequate,
if
indeed
it's
worth
a
lot
more,
that
will
be
handled.
not
necessarily.
the
state
court
could
find,
and
i
suspect
this
state
court
would
find,
that
it's
worth
the
money
to
be
in
state
court.
