chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-1450,
the
standard
fire
insurance
company
v.
knowles.
mr.
boutrous.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
issue
were
not
the
amount
sought
but
rather
the
substantive
claims?
say
there
are
two
different
claims
the
class
member
--
the
class
could
raise.
one
would
yield
damages
of
$4,900,000.
the
other
would
yield
damages
of
$10
million.
do
you
have
the
same
objection
in
a
case
in
which
the
prospective
representative
only
pleads
the
first
claim?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
do
seem
to
have
a
difficulty
with
your
position
about
how
far
it
goes.
you
make
the
point
in
your
briefs
about
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
in
other
words,
it's
not
just
how
much
they
claim,
but
where
they
decide
to
cut
off
the
statute
of
limitations
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
a
bit
of
a
slippery
slope
if
you
start
saying
we're
going
to
look
at
what
the
class
could
recover
in
deciding
whether
or
not,
not
simply
whether
or
not
this
representative
is
adequate,
but
whether
or
not
it's
below
or
above,
above
or
below
$5
million.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
approach
leads
to
particularly
perverse
results.
you're
at
the
position
of
arguing
that,
you
know,
they
are
seeking
less
than
$5
million,
but
we're
responsible
for
a
lot
more
damage
than
that.
and
of
course,
you
don't
concede
it,
but
you
do
say:
if
in
fact
we're
liable,
the
damages
are
going
to
be
a
lot
greater.
i
assume
that
admission
could
be
used
against
you
under
principles
of
judicial
estoppel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
go
by
seniority.
justice
alito.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you're
assuming
that
it's
a
bad
thing
for
the
class
members
to
have
their
claims
limited.
but
it
may
well
be
a
good
thing
for
them
to
have
their
claims
limited
if
that
gets
them
into
what
would
reasonably
be
regarded
as
a
more
sympathetic
forum.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
you
--
i
assume
you
agree
that
if
at
the
adequacy
hearing,
if
there
ever
is
one,
and
it's
demonstrated
that
well,
in
fact,
the
amount
in
controversy
is
$10
million,
then
you
would
be
obviously
not
an
adequate
representative.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
you
had
a
case
where
a
lawyer
brings
an
action
in
miller
county
and
says:
i
want
to
represent
the
class
of
people
with
these
claims
and
these
claims,
whose
names
begin
with
a
to
k.
it
turns
out
that's
$4
million.
and
in
the
next
county,
at
the
same
time,
he
files
a
case
saying,
i'd
like
to
represent
these
people
whose
names
begin
l
to
z.
in
each
of
those
cases,
it's
$4
million.
i
take
it
you
don't
have
any
objection
to
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
is
a
counsel
who
proceeds
on
that
basis,
is
there
any
reason
to
question
his
adequacy,
let's
say
he's
fully
representing,
bringing
all
the
claims
and
all
the
damages.
he's
just
decided
to
break
it
up
from
a
to
k.
somebody
from
l
is
not
going
to
say:
well,
he's
inadequate
when
he's
representing
him
just
because
he
could
have
represented
everybody
in
the
other
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
realize,
of
course,
you
are
on
pretty
thin
ice.
you
are
talking
about
a
senate
report
and
now
you
are
talking
about
proposals
that
weren't
enacted.
your
friend
on
the
other
side
focuses
on
the
statutory
language
which
tells
you
how
to
find
out
how
much
is
at
stake.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
another
thing
he
might
be
worried
about
is
that
if
this
actions
is
allowed
to
proceed,
although
on
its
face
it's
worth
$4
million,
they're
going
to
have
to
make
a
determination
whether
to
settle
for
a
particular
amount
or
not.
and
if
they
make
a
determination
that
they've
got
to
settle
for
whatever
it
is,
20
--
you
know,
$20
per
class
member,
that
is
going
to
set
the
limit
for
other
classes,
including
the
class
members
who
opt
out
of
this
action,
the
class
members
from
missouri.
and
the
point
is
that,
for
a
variety
of
reasons,
that
this
gives
extraordinary
leverage
to
the
individual
class
representative
of
a
sort
that
--
precisely
the
sort
that
congress
was
worried
about.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
going
to
be
worth
a
lot
more,
because
if
you
go
to
trial,
you're
going
to
have
a
judgment
that
they
should
have
been
giving
the
general
contractor
whatever--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--pickup
it
is
in
every
case.
and
so
that
is
going
to
be
extremely
valuable.
it's
going
to
be
worth
a
lot
more
--
but
the
downside,
it's
going
to
be
a
lot
more
than
$5
million.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
very
difficult
--
one
reason,
it's
very
difficult
to
speculate
about
congress,
what
they
speculate
about
what
they
would
have
intended.
presumably,
they
may
not
have
thought
about
the
idea
that
there
will
be
class
actions
worth
a
lot
more
than
$5
million,
but
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
will
only
ask
for
less
than
$5
million.
chief
justice

g.
roberts,
jr.

did
you

in

county?
