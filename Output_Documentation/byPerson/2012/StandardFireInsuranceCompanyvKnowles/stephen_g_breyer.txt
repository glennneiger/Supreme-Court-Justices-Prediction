justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
what
i
--
could
you
go
back--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to
justice
kagan's
first
question?
i
was
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
if
i
look
at
1332,
which
has
been
on
the
books
a
long
time,
it
says:
"the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
all
civil
actions
where
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
or
value
of
$75,000,
exclusive
of
interest,
of
costs,
and.
"
--et
cetera,
okay?
then
i
look
here
and
it
says:
"the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
in
which
the
manner
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
or
value
of
$5
million,
exclusive
of
interest
and
costs.
"
et
cetera,
okay?
so
the
words
seem
identical.
now,
in
respect
to
the
first,
we
know
that
a
lawyer
can
file
a
binding
stipulation
that
says,
i
don't
care
what
this
is
about,
i
am
not
asking
for
more
than
$75,000,
and
the
federal
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
given
that's
true
in
the
first
statute,
and
given
that
the
second
statute
is
almost
identically
worded,
at
least
in
that
part,
why
can't
you
do
the
same
thing
with
the
$5
million?
and
it
can't
be
the
words
i
quoted
that
stops
him
from
doing
it,
so
what
is
the
word
that
stops
him
from
doing
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
to
what
that
looks
like,
“
shall
be
aggregated
”,
again
from
the
language,
is
it
simply
to
make
certain
that
zahn
does
not
require
the
individual
thing
to
approach
--
to
count.
in
other
words,
you
aggregate
rather
than
just
looking
at
the
individual
members,
which
is
zahn,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
they
rarely
pass
a
statute
that
says:
let's
just
get
rid
of
case
x.
normally
they
look
to
the
holding
of
case
x,
and
then
they
pass
the
statute
that
says
the
opposite.
so
the
holding
of
zahn
was
that
you
could
not
aggregate
the
individual
members'
claims
in
a
class.
so
to
get
rid
of
zahn,
what
we
do
is
we
pass
a
statute
that
says
you
can
aggregate.
and
indeed,
nobody
objects
here
to
the
aggregation.
it's
the
total
amount
of
the
claims
being
limited
by
a
stipulation
that
is
the
issue
here,
and
that's
why
i
had
trouble
finding
your
argument
in
the
word
“
aggregation
”.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
same
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
so,
this
is
just
a
loophole
because
it
swallows
up
all
of
congress's
statute,
which
is
what
their
problem
is,
all
you
have
to
do,
even
if
you
were
less
obvious
than
the
chief
justice's
example,
what
you
do
is
you
--
you
file
a
complaint,
you
say
it's
for
$4,900,000;
in
fact,
it's
worth
10
million.
but
you
inform
people,
unlike
justice
alito,
you
figure
a
way
around
his
problem,
you
keep
them
informed,
and
you
say:
it's
getting
close,
getting
close.
and
once
you
are
up
to
$4,800,000,
the
others
get
the
word:
stay
out
of
it.
and
once
they
stay
out
of
it,
you
go
ahead
with
your
action
and
then
those
that
stayed
out
of
it
becomes
the
subject
of
a
second
action.
and
if
it's
for
50
millions,
then
you
have
ten
actions
and
then
you
have
20.
so,
in
fact,
all
that
is
required
is
a
few
extra
pieces
of
paper
that
will
soon
become
standardized,
and
a
lot
of
postage
stamps.
and
we
have
30
or
40
or
$50
million
cases
being
tried
in
whatever
counties
congress
liked
the
least.
i
gather
they're
some
in
arkansas.
but
that
seems
to
be
all
behind
justice
scalia's
and
the
chief
justice's
questions,
and
i
would
like
to
hear
a
pretty
complete
answer
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
you
said
then
in
response
--
we're
on
the
same
subject,
and
i'm
drawing
the
conclusion
from
what
you
say
that
yes,
we've
found
a
way
around
this.
and
what
we're
going
to
do
is
we
will
divide
our
$25
million
class
action
into
six
subsidiary
actions
and
proceed
exactly
the
same
merry
way.
and
we
do
that
by
means
of
stipulation.
now,
your
words
in
the
statute
do
favor
that,
in
my
opinion,
at
the
moment.
but
the
purpose
seems
to
strongly
cut
the
other
way.
and
i
do
see
a
way
to
go
the
other
way,
in
that
you
could
say,
given
the
purpose
of
this,
the
words
do
mean
something
different,
and
they
do
mean
you
should
aggregate
the
real
value
of
the
real
amounts
that
the
class
is
likely
to
have.
now,
it's
capable
of
that
reading,
and
the
virtue
of
that
reading
is
that
it
would
stop
what
looks
like,
from
what
you're
saying,
a
mechanical
method
of
avoiding
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
say
that
explicitly
because
i
really
want
to
make
it
as
much
as
possible
that
you
will
focus
in
on
what's
a
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
--
what
about,
has
anyone
thought
of
this
--
i
hate
to
bring
up
sort
of
a
new
idea,
but
somebody
may
have
thought
of
it.
imagine
we're
now
in
the
federal
district
court.
and
the
federal
district
court
reads
the
statute
because
the
case
has
just
been
removed.
and
he
says,
you
know,
this
--
this
case
would
be
worth
a
lot
more
than
5
million
were
it
not
for
that
stipulation.
and
let
now
me
look
at
that
stipulation.
that
stipulation
is
a
part
of
some,
let's
call
it
quote
“
monkey
business
”,
end
quote,
which
you
will
resist
that,
but
i
mean
by
that
to
--
to
encompass
the
kinds
of
things
we've
been
talking
about,
that
there
are
going
to
be
five
similar
class
actions,
that
they're
going
to
take
the
people
a
through
k,
that
they're
going
to
--
anything
like
that.
and
he
says
that's
not
under
this
statute
the
kind
of
stipulation
that
congress
meant
to
bar
my
consideration
of
the
$5
million.
so
if
it's
a
manipulative
stipulation,
whatever
that
might
be,
it
doesn't
bar
me
as
the
district
judge
from
aggregating
up
to
--
beyond
5
million,
but
if
it's
not
manipulative,
fine.
has
there
--
has
there
been
any
thought
on
that
kind
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
but
there
might
be
--
there
might
be
ways
of
working
with
this
notion,
a
little
risky
from
your
point
of
view,
but
there
might
be
ways
of
working
with
this
good
faith
notion
so
that
some
--
there
would
be
some
power
in
the
federal
district
court
to
set
aside
certain
stipulations
which
were
used
for
manipulative
purposes
and
what
definition
that
manipulative
is
something
that
isn't
clear
to
--
to
me
at
the
moment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
case
is
simpler.
it's
called
“standard
fire.”
the
class
action
fairness
act
provides
that
federal
“district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction”
of
a
civil
“class-action”
if
among
other
things
the
“matter
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
or
value
of
five
million
dollars.”
the
statute
adds
that
to
determine
whether
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
five
million
dollars,
the
claims,
including
the
claims
of
any
proposed
class
member
shall
be
aggregated.
in
this
case,
a
plaintiff
filed
a
proposed
class-action
complaint
in
arkansas
state
court.
the
defendants
sought
to
remove
the
case
to
federal
court.
the
federal
court
aggregated
the
claims
to
those
who
fit
the
definition
of
the
purported
class.
the
court
found
that
the
aggregate
amount
exceeded
five
million
dollars,
but
the
court,
nonetheless
remanded
the
case
to
state
court
because
the
plaintiff
had
also
filed
a
stipulation
in
which
he
promised
the
damages
would
not
exceed
five
million
dollars.
this
stipulation,
the
federal
court
decided,
would
assure
that
the
sum
or
value
of
the
claims
would
still,
and
nonetheless,
fall
below
the
five
million
dollar
threshold.
in
our
view,
however,
the
stipulation
could
not
defeat
otherwise
proper
federal
jurisdiction.
our
reason
is
a
simple
one.
the
stipulation
was
not
binding.
the
class
had
not
yet
been
certified
and
a
stipulation
does
not
bind
proposed
class
members
prior
to
certification,
thus
the
stipulation
cannot
assure
that
the
sum
or
value
of
the
claims
will
fall
below
five
million
dollars.
our
opinion
sets
forth
the
authority
for
these
basic
legal
propositions
and
it
explains
our
reasoning
at
somewhat
greater
length.
our
decision
is
unanimous.
