justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--is
there
a
difference
between
what
you
are
advocating
and
the
approach
that's
now
taken
in
the
general
removal
statute
as
it's
been
amended
recently
under
1446(c)(2)?
so
there
as
i
read
it,
the
amount
demanded
in
the
complaint
is
not
necessarily
controlling.
a
case
can
be
removed
even
if
the
amount
demanded
in
the
complaint
is
below
the
jurisdictional
threshold
and
then
the
defendant
can
prove
that
the
real
amount
involved
exceeds
the
jurisdictional
threshold.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
even
if
this
case
were
handled
on
remand
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court
exactly
like
a
federal
class
action,
i
don't
understand
how
absent
class
members
would
ever
be
able
to
--
to
determine
whether
by
failing
to
opt
out,
they
had
compromised
part
of
their
claim.
i
don't
see
how,
even
if
they're
notified
that
there's
a
$5
million
cap
--
and
i
don't
know
that
rule
23
requires
that,
but
suppose
they're
notified
of
that.
they
can't
tell
whether
by
remaining
a
member
of
the
class
their
claim
is
going
to
be
compromised
at
all.
it
would
depend
on
lots
of
different
things,
including
how
many
members
are
in
the
class
after
it's
certified.
and
that's
something
they
can't
know.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
under
your
argument,
the
amount
that's
demanded
seems
to
be
totally
meaningless.
here,
we
are
told
that
the
real
amount
is
only
slightly
above
the
$5
million
figure,
but
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference.
so
let's
say
that
what
was
--
you
stipulate
you
are
not
going
to
get
more
than
$5
million,
but
really
the
value
of
the
claim
is
$50
million.
and
you
say
that's
perfectly
okay.
it
will
be
dealt
with
later
when
the
case
--
after
the
case
has
been
remanded
to
the
--
to
the
state
courts.
isn't
that
right?
so
the
$5
million
is
just
--
just
means
nothing.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
practical
terms.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
but
does
that
matter?
we
assume,
i
think,
that
the
real
amount
is
a
little
bit
over
$5
million.
suppose
the
real
amount
is
6
million
or
7
million,
8
million,
does
it
matter
where
along
that
continuum
the
real
amount
falls?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
this
were
an
individual
action,
and
the
amount
is
--
an
individual
diversity
action
--
and
the
amount
that
is
pled
is
under
$75,000.
the
defendant
still
can
remove
the
case
and
prove
that
the
amount
is
really
higher
than
that,
because
the
practice
of
the
state
in
question
is
to
allow
a
recovery
that
is
over
$75,000.
so
why
shouldn't
the
same
approach
apply
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
wouldn't
it
be
perverse
if
the
rule
were
that
in
an
individual
action
where
a
plaintiff
is
simply
stipulating
how
much
he
or
she
is
demanding
--
individually
--
which
the
person
can
do,
it's
possible
to
look
behind
that
number.
but
in
a
class
action
where
the
named
plaintiff
is
purporting
to
make
a
stipulation
on
behalf
of
absent
class
members
as
to
whom
the
named
plaintiff
at
that
point
has
absolutely
no
authority,
you
can't
look
behind
the
number--
