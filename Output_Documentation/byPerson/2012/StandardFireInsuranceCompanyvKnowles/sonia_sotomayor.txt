justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
why
doesn't
--
why
doesn't
the
normal
class
certification
process
protect
adequately
the
absent
class
members?
first
of
all,
counsel
has
to
prove
he
or
she
is
adequate.
so
doesn't
that
mean
that
if
they
enter
a
stipulation
that
is
grossly
unfair
to
the
class
that
the
judge
is
not
going
to
certify
that
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
answered.
if
--
if
the
court
finds
the
stipulation
inadequate
for
the
class,
is
that
class
going
to
be
certified?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
then
they
would
get
removed
to
the
federal
court,
which
is
what
the
statute
was
intended
to
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
discovery
vis
a
vis
the
certification
of
the
class
is
going
to
happen
anyway.
my
point
is
that
much
of
your
argument
in
your
brief
is
centered
around
binding
the
absent
class
members.
what
i'm
getting
to
is
that
if
the
stipulation
is
grossly
unfair,
there
may
not
be
a
class
at
all,
or
the
plaintiffs
who
have
claims
greater
than
those
in
the
aggregate
might
opt
--
will
get
notice
and
opt
out.
and
there
is
due
process
challenges
if
a
settlement
is
entered
that
is
so
grossly
unfair
that
it
violates
due
process.
so
i
don't
know
why
the
process
itself
doesn't
protect
the
interests
of
congress.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
--
you
chimed
into
this
discussion--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
would
never
involve
a
judgment
that
a
claim
is
really
worth
$50
million
and
just
to
defeat
this
statute,
it's
being
limited
to
5.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
only
strategic
reason
according
to
your
adversary
is
they
want
to
stay
in
state
court.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
frederick,
your
answer
just
doesn't
deal
with
the
component
that's
been
troubling,
which
is
that
it
doesn't
protect
the
absent
class
members.
in
situations
like
the
one
justice
alito
or
the
point
justice
alito
made,
which
is
they
don't
really
know
how
much
the
entire
quantity
of
the
class
might
truly
be,
and
who's
protecting
them--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--if
it
would
go
your
way?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
can't
the
case
be
removed
at
that
moment?
