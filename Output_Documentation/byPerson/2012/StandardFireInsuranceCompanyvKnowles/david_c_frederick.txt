mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
the
stipulation
is
binding
throughout
the
"civil
action
filed
by
the
putative
class
representative.
"
i
want
to
focus
on
the
words
“
civil
action
”
because
there
has
been
no
civil
action
filed
by
any
absent
class
members.
the
only
civil
action
that
the
district
court
is
being
considered
for
jurisdiction
is
the
civil
action
that
has
been
filed
by
the
putative
class
representative.
so
if
the
class
is
later
not
certified,
the
stipulation
would
only
bind
the
putative
class
representative.
if
the
class
is
certified--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
what
1332(d)(1)(b)
does,
justice
kennedy,
is
define
class
action
in
terms
of
the
civil
action
that
was
filed
so
long
as
it
was
filed
pursuant
to
federal
rule
23
or
an
equivalent
state
statute.
what
the
complaint
here
does
in
the
prayer
for
relief
and
in
paragraph
11
of
the
complaint
is
to
say
that
this
civil
action
is
not
going
to
be
worth
more
than
$5
million.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
that
would
be
one
outcome
that
a
state
court
could
come
to.
a
second
outcome
could
be
that
at
that
point,
if
an
alternate
class
member
comes
in
and
files
an
intervened
complaint
and
says:
this
case
really
is
worth
$10
million,
at
that
point
section
1453(b)
applies
and
they
can
remove
to
federal
court.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
what's
very
clear,
justice
scalia,
is
that
congress
was
not
attempting
to
address
the
adequacy
of
class
representation
issue
where
it
decided
this
statute
and
enacted
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
a
putative
class
representative
makes
all
kinds
of
strategic
judgments
about
how
best
to
maximize
value
for
his
clients
and
for
the
class.
and
that
entails
judgments
about
whether
to
assert
various
legal
theories
here.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
goes
to
your
very
first
question,
this
complaint
renounced
a
claim
to
punitive
damages.
but
there
are
some
cases
out
of
the
tenth
circuit,
the
frederick
case,
not
associated
with
me,
and
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
back
doctors
case,
they
say
essentially
if
there
is
a
claim
for
punitive
damages
you
have
to
make
an
estimate
for
amount
in
controversy
purposes.
as
i
understand
their
theory
and
as
they
express
it
on
page
11
of
the
reply
brief,
it's
very
uncertain
as
to
a
case
like
ours
where
we
have
renounced
a
claim
to
punitive
damages
whether
or
not
a
federal
district
court
is,
nonetheless,
supposed
to
take
that
into
account.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
my
objection
would
be
at
the
class
certification
stage,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
the
requisite
of
locality,
numerosity,
the
contrivances
that
are
being
done
are
--
are
going
to
whether
or
not
those
represent
--
representatives
are
adequate.
it
does
not
speak
to
federal
jurisdiction--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
misunderstood,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
for
federal
jurisdiction
purposes,
the
court
has
always
had
--
that
kind
of
legal
strategy
is
perfectly
appropriate
under
the
master
of
the
complaint--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--sure.
justice
breyer,
if
you
look
at
the
report
that
went
along
with
the
statute,
what
congress
was
most
concerned
about
was
the
situation
where
each
individual
class
member
would
not
be
able
to
exceed
$75,000
but
there
might
be
a
million
of
them.
and
so
you
might
have
a
million
class
members,
each
of
whom
had
a
claim
for
$50,000,
and
there
was
no
way
to
get
that
to
federal
court
because
of
the
zahn
non-aggregating
rule.
congress
was
not
concerned
about
having
the
master
of
the
complaint
altered
in
this
class
process;
and,
in
fact,
congress
rejected
a
proposal
that
would
lower
the
amount
in
controversy
for
class
actions
to
$2
million
because
the
congressional
budget
office
said:
if
you
keep
it
at
that
low,
virtually
every
class
action
will
be
in
federal
court
and
congress
has
not
appropriated
additional
funds
for
the
federal
courts
to
deal
with
all
of
the
class
actions
that
would
occupy
this
space.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
i'm
telling
you
that
his
focus
on
the
word
“
claims
”
is
insufficient
because
there
are
no
claims
by
absent
members
until
there
is
a
civil
action
that
has
been
filed.
and
that
is
why
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
a
class
action,
it
is
a
civil
action
that
is
filed
pursuant
to
one
of
those
rules.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
the
5
million--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
alito,
it
means
we
have
to
determine
and
the
district
court
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
5
million
has
been
satisfied
on
the
basis
of
the
well
pleaded
complaint
and
an
aggregation
where,
as
a
factual
matter
and
as
a
stipulated
matter
in
paragraph
11
of
the
complaint,
the
class
representative
here
said:
this
case
is
not
worth
more
than
$5
million.
and
we
know
that
that's
true
because
even
under
their
estimate
of
all
of
the
class
members
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
the
damages
only
equal
about
$3
million.
and
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not
so
long
as
there
is
a
binding
stipulation
that
says
so
long
as
this
civil
action
is
in
place,
it
is
not
going
to
be
worth
$5
million.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
well,
justice
breyer,
congress
could
have
addressed
any
number
of
those
kinds
of
issues
with
the
specific
terms
that
it
used,
but
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
and
the
master
of
the
complaint
rule
is
a
very
subtle
part
of
our
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
that
is
so
because
we
want
these
jurisdictional
issues
to
be
simple,
not
complicated.
under
their
approach,
they
would
take
all
the
conceivable
legal
theories
that
might
be
brought
over
a
conceivable
period
of
time,
and
ask
the
district
court
to
make
very
nuanced
judgments
about
--
what--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
try
it
this
way,
which
is
that
for
the
large
case,
the
one
that
i
gave
in
my
hypothetical
where
there
are
a
million
class
members,
and
each
of
them
has
a
claim
of
$50,000,
we
know
that
prior
to
cafa,
that
case
was
staying
in
state
court
because
of
this
court's
zahn
rule.
but
that
might
be
a
nationwide
case.
it
might
be
worth
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
damages.
that
was
the
kind
of
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at.
but
the
case
where
there's
a
stipulation
that
actually
might
be
meaningful,
where
the
amount
in
controversy
is
debatable
as
to
whether
it's
really
$5
million,
that's
the
kind
of
case
where
jurisdictional
simplicity
ought
to
encourage--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct,
because
--
and
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
that's
precisely
because
we
want
the
ability
to
make
legal
judgments
and
strategies
to
reside
in
the
person
who's
bringing
the
complaint.
we
don't
want--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not
where
there
are
allegations
about
what
the
aggregated
damages
are
about.
that's
why
--
to
address
this
in
the
language
of
the
civil
action,
those
absent
class
members
haven't
filed
any
lawsuit.
we
don't
really
know
what
claims
they
might
conceivably
bring
if
they
were
to
be
hypothesized.
what
we
do
know
is
that
there
is
a
civil
action,
it
has
been
filed
by
a
putative
class
representative,
that
putative
class
representative
in
good
faith,
the
district
court
found
had
acted
in
good
faith
in
stipulating
to
a
lower
amount
than
$5
million
--
and
the
question
is
should
that
be
given
legal
effect,
where
everybody
knows
it
will
be
binding
if
the
class
is
certified,
and
it
will
be
binding
on
the
class
representative
if
the
class
is
not
certified.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
you
were
referring
to
a
statute,
justice
alito,
that
was
recently
enacted,
in
which
it
does
say
that
the
presumption
shall
be
that
the
amount
pleaded
in
the
complaint
is
subject
to
disproval.
but
that's
reversing
200
--
well,
100-plus
years
of
settled
removal
law,
after
the
reforms
of
the
1870s
created
the
removal
jurisdiction
the
way
it
is
more
currently
constructed.
and
so
in
that
interregnum
between
the
1870s
and
that
statute
passed
just
a
couple
of
years
ago,
the
rule
was
well-settled
that
the
individual
case
pleading
amount
was
fine.
and
under
st.
paul
mercury,
if
there
was
a
stipulation
that
had
been
filed
contemporaneously
with
the
complaint
or
prior
to
removal,
that
that
would
be
given
legal
effect.
here,
the
stipulation
was
filed
with
the
complaint.
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
was
done
in
good
faith.
the
district
court
found
that
--
and
i
don't
think
that's
really
an
even
arguable
proposition
here,
where
they
were
asserting
a
40
percent
attorney's
fee
on
this
--
and
so
really
the
question
is,
where
you
have
an
aggregated
estimate,
should
that
be
given
legal
effect.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
as
a
policy
matter,
we
might
have
a
debate
about
the
various
virtues
of
that,
but
they
were
not
enacted
in
the
same
piece
of
legislation.
so
what
we
do
know
is
that
for
cafa,
congress
had
not
adopted
the
rule
that
you're
positing.
nonetheless,
we
do
not
attempt
to
argue
that
they
have
no
basis
for
making
arguments
about
amount
of
controversy
when
they
remove,
but
it
is
subject
to
the
rule
that
a
binding
stipulation
shall
be
given
binding
effect
in
the
civil
action
that
has
been
filed.
and
if
that
is
later
proved
to
be
inadequate--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
ginsburg,
this
is
important
that
you
and
i
understand
each
other
on
this
point,
because
it
is
binding
in
the
civil
action
filed
for
all
purposes.
so,
whoever
is
covered
by
that
civil
action
will
forever
be
bound
by
the
$5
million
stipulation.
what
we
do
not
know
is
who
will
be
members
of
that
class
until
the
certification
hearing
is
done.
whoever
ends
up
being
covered
by
that
civil
action
will
forever
be
bound
by
that
stipulation.
that
is
what
the
district
court
knows.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
for
two
reasons,
because
there
are
protections
that
are
in
the
statute
that
protect
both
defendants
and
absent
class
members.
and
the
protection
for
the
absent
class
members
is
it
that
if
that
stipulation
is
insufficient
to
adequately
represent
their
interests,
the
district
court,
the
trial
court
and
state
court
will
not
certify
the
class.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
--
and
as
a
matter
of
judicial
estoppel,
what
is
absolutely
clear
in
every
state
that
i
am
familiar
with
is
that
it
follows
this
court's
basic
formula
in
new
hampshire
v.
maine,
which
looks
at
whether
or
not
a
change
in
position
would
prejudice
the
interests
of
the
other
party
if
the
court
had
relied
on
the
original
position
of
the
litigant,
and
that
will
estop
that
person.
now,
it
may
--
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
due
process
issues
associated
with
class
representative
and
the
adequacy
of
a
class
representative
is
a
continuing
concern
throughout
a
litigation
precisely
because
of
due
process
concerns.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
actually,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
with
all
due
respect,
the
economic
incentives
are
completely
reversed,
because
if
a
class
representative
is
bound
by
a
stipulation
that
this
case
is
not
worth
than
$5
million,
the
bidding
starts
at
5
million,
but
it
goes
down,
it
doesn't
go
north,
because
the
defendant
knows
that
no
matter
whether
we
go
to
trial
or
not,
this
case,
this
civil
action
is
only
going
to
be
worth
$5
million.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
gcop.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice,
congress
could
have
drafted
a
statute
that
allowed
for
the
removal
of
every
state
class
action
and
dealt
with
that
issue
if
it
was
deemed
appropriate
to
have
federal
courts
decide
all
class
actions,
but
that
wasn't
the
statute
that
congress
enacted.
and
congress
also
could
have
expressed
concerns
and
difficulty
with
this
idea
of
having
the
master
of
the
complaint
rule
applied
in
the
class
action
context,
but
it
didn't
address
that
either.
and
so
when
congress
is
only
addressing
a
very
narrow
problem
of
dealing
with
the
non-aggregation
principle
so
that
class
actions
that
were
worth
more
than
$5
million
would
be
allowed
to
be
removed
to
federal
court,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
try
to
infer
a
larger
set
of--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
these
kinds
of
stipulations
are
well
known
and
in
fact,
as
we
quote
on,
i
think
it's
page
5
of
our
brief,
congress
was
aware
of
factual
stipulations.
they
concede
in
their
reply
brief
that
it's
perfectly
fine
for
their
to
be
a
joint
stipulation
between
the
putative
class
representative
and
the
defendants.
and
yet,
i
would
think
that
that
would
raise
even
more
problems
and
concerns
by
you,
because
that
would
lead
to
the
kind
of
collusion
between
a
putative
class
representative
and
the
defendant
without
knowing
what
the
other
interests
of
the
absent
class
members
are.
and
so
here,
where
a
good
faith
effort
is
made
to
quantify
the
aggregate
claims
and
that
good
faith
effort
leads
to
the
stipulation
that
the
case
will
not
be
worth
more
than
$5
million,
the
interests
of
jurisdictional
simplicity,
the
interest
of
fairness
to
the
class
members,
the
interest
of
understanding
what
the
civil
action
is
all
about
so
that
the
defendant
is
on
notice
about
what
will
be
claimed
in
this
civil
action
are
all
things
that
should
be
given
respect.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
there
are
two
tools
that
--
that
we
describe
in
our
brief
and
that
i
think
are
reasonable
ways
that
federal
courts
address
these
matters.
one
is
to
look
at
whether
or
not
it
violates
rule
11
and
there
are
--
there's
a
frivolous
assertion
of
a
stipulation,
which
federal
district
judges
deal
with
rule
11
motions
all
the
time.
the
second
is
the
concept
of
good
faith,
which
is
what
st.
paul
mercury
addressed
when
it
said
that
a
stipulation
for
less
than
the
jurisdictional
amount
if
made
in
good
faith
is
something
that
will
be
treated
as
dispositive
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
if
i'm
understanding
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
it's
at
the
amount
of
controversy
stage
and
so
there
is
litigation
at
that
stage
and
the
defendant
presumably
would
bring
to
the
judge's
attention,
i
think
this
is
being
done
in
bad
faith
and
i
have
these
arguments
for
why
this
is
deceiting
--
deceitful,
misleading,
et
cetera.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
there
are
lots
of
tactical
reasons
why
litigants
might
want
to
limit
their
claims
or
might
have
a
good
faith
basis
for
saying,
i've
only
investigated
this
time
period,
i
do
not
have
a
good
faith
basis
for
asserting
claims
in
a
different
time
period
that
i
have
not
investigated
that
does
not
serve
the
court.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
--
the
--
the
notion
that
i
have
distilled
from
st.
paul
mercury
and
the
idea
of
good
faith
and
looking
at
cases
that
have
addressed
bad
faith,
which
is
obviously
the
converse
of
good
faith,
is
whether
or
not
there
is
something
misleading
or
deceitful
in
the
way
that
this
stipulation
would
be
framed.
and
i
think
that
that
is
as
good
a
guidance
as
i
can
give
you
absent
briefing.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
there
--
there
could
be
a
strategic
reason,
justice
sotomayor,
why--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
but
there
are
reasons,
because
in
arkansas,
for
instance,
there
is
a
direct
appeal
for
the
state
supreme
court.
we
could
finish
this
case
in
many
fewer
years
than
it
would
take
to
wind
its
way
up
through
the
eighth
circuit
and
up
to
this
court.
that
is
one
salutary
reason.
the
second
is
we're
talking
about
state
law
claims
that
are
breach
of
contract
claims
for
a
state-regulated
industry.
the
state
insurance
board
would
be
looking
at
how
state
insurance
is
done
here.
so
there
are
very
good
reasons
why
a
--
why
a
lawyer
would
want
this
case
to
be
in
state
court
and
not
want
it
to
be
removed
to
federal
court
wholly
apart
from
the
ad
hominem
attacks
that
they
make
about
miller
county
which
were
not
brought
to
congress's
attention
and
in
fact
are
false.
as
we
have
put
into
amicus
briefs,
it
is
false.
the
arguments
that
they
talk
about
abuse
involve
all
cases
that
predated
cafa.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
because
these
are
texarkana
lawyers
who
filed
on
behalf
of
all
arkansas
residents
and
texarkana,
arkansas
is
a
jurisdiction
in
arkansas.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--sure.
in
his
hypothetical,
that's
true
under
federal
rules,
too.
if
you're
applying
federal
rule
23
and
you
have
a
large
number
of
class
members
and
the
case
gets
settled
for
x
dollars,
the
individual
class
member
is
held
to
the
duty
of
deciding
whether
to
opt
out
because
that
individual
class
member
thinks
i
may
have
been
able
to
get
more
than
what
is
being
offered
in
this
class
settlement
or
to
attack
the
adequacy
of
the
representation
because
the
aggregate
amount
is
not
high
enough.
it's
a
problem
that
applies
in
both
federal
and
in
state
court.
it's
not
unique
to
state
court
at
all.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we'll
submit.
