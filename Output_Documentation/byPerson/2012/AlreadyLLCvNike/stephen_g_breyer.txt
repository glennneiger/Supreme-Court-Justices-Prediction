justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
right,
that's
the
standard.
and
so
you
said
that
--
i
mean,
i
feel
perhaps
more
calmly
about
this
than
i
might
feel
is
warranted,
but
the
--
the
question
is,
is
there
anything
here
that
you
--
so
you
said
by
definition,
we're
going
to
produce
some
new
shoes,
which
new
shoes
are
not
--
do
not
have
the
appearance
of
any
current
and/or
previous
footwear
product
designs
and
any
colorable
imitations
thereof.
so
i
would
like
you
to
refer
me
to
the
record
where
your
president
of
your
client
or
somebody
else
says
we
are
intending
to
produce
some
new
shoes
that
fall
outside
that
definition,
and
of
course,
i
will
look
at
that.
because
your
opponent
says
we
can
find
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
they
are
going
to
produce
anything
or
they
have
any
present
intent
of
showing,
of
producing
something
that
falls
outside
that
definition.
but
now,
you
just
said,
oh,
no,
we're
definitely
going
to.
so
just
refer
me
to
those
pages
in
the
record
that
shows
that,
because,
of
course,
you
win
if
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that
isn't
the
point.
the
point
is,
is
the
new
footwear
that
you're
designing
footwear
that
is
not
--
does
not
have
the
appearance
of
any
current
or
previous
footwear
product
designs
or
any
colorable
imitation
thereof?
and
so
to
say
you
are
in
the
business
of
producing
new
footwear,
at
least
to
me,
suggests
nothing,
because
the
question
is
what
the
footwear
looks
like,
not
that
you're
producing
new
footwear.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
not
interested
in
the
real
world.
i
am
interested
in
the
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
does
it
show
anything
at
all
in
respect
that
would
support
the
claim
that
you
are
going
to
produce
new
footwear
that
doesn't
either
resemble
nor
is
a
colorable
imitation
of
anything
that
you
have
previously
produced
or
is
the
subject
of
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
period?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
i
take
it
that
this
case
really
boils
down
to,
should
you
have
--
should
they
have
or
you
both
have
another
chance
to
say
what
the
new
footwear
will
be
--
look
like
under
a
new
standard,
or
is
there
enough
here
already
to
say,
well,
really,
the
judges
could
conclude
that
there
is
no
real
likelihood
that
you're
going
to
produce
something
that
won't
look
like
what's
already
been
produced?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
maybe
you
could
suggest
to
me
that
we
should
change
what
the
law
has
been
or
not
follow
it
here,
but
where
i'm
taking
the
law
from
is
friends
of
the
earth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
friends
of
the
earth
it
says
a
defendant,
namely
nike,
claiming
its
voluntary
compliance
moots
a
case,
and
what
they're
claiming
is
that
this
--
a
covenant
moots
the
case,
moots
the
case,
the
covenant
they
gave.
there's
the
formidable
burden
--
you
know,
it's
formidable,
you're
quite
right
--
of
showing
it
is
absolutely
clear,
correct,
that
the
allegedly
wrongful
behavior,
namely
their
suing,
but
their
suing
in
respect
to
this
kind
of
shoe
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
recur.
and
they
say,
since
we
promised
in
an
enforceable
promise
not
to
repeat
this
behavior
ever,
100
years,
how
could
it
be
expected
reasonably
to
recur?
how
could
our
behavior,
namely
suing
for
infringement
in
respect
to
a
shoe
like
this,
be
reasonably
expected
to
recur
given
our
covenant?
and
your
response
to
that
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
--
i
would
like
to
know.
i
mean,
i
assume
you
ask
them,
do
you
have
any
current
or
future
plan
to
produce
a
shoe
that
would
violate
our
mark--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
that
might,
which
does
not
look
at
all
like
the
present
--
your
present
shoe,
and
isn't
even
colorably
like
your
present
shoe,
do
you
have
a
plan
to
do
such
a
thing,
are
you
in
the
process,
is
it
likely?
and
they
say,
no,
it's
not
likely.
that's
the
end
of
it,
they're
just
as
if
they
manufactured
cell
phones.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
they
were
to
say,
you
know,
we
make
new
shoes
all
the
time--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
this
is
some
kind
of
thing
we
might
well
consider,
and
we
have
people
working
on
it;
and
they
are
considering
whether
to
do
it
or
not,
it's
well
in
the
works
--
they
win.
okay?
what
did
they
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
say
is
that
they
changed
this
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
a
minute.
you
know,
they
have
--
they
have
stuff
they
put
out,
and
we
have
the
yums
and
the
sweet,
whatever
it
is
and
the
jelly
bean
and
so
forth,
and
we
keep
changing
it.
and
so
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
seem
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
if
it
is
--
if
i
come
to
that
conclusion,
is
it
the
case
--
i
thought
perhaps
in
looking
at
this
that
the
line
i
quoted,
remember,
which
puts
a
lot
of
burden
on
you,
from
friends
of
the
earth,
is
not
quoted
in
the
district
court,
not
quoted
in
the
court
of
appeals,
so
perhaps
the
thing
--
i
think
the
sg
wants
something
like
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
say,
okay,
this
is
the
standard;
it's
tough
for
nike
to
show
this;
you
seem
to
have
conducted
this
case
without
that
standard
quite
in
mind.
it's
tough
for
nike,
but
they
can
do
it,
you
know,
depending
on
the
facts,
and
you
have
these
protective
orders,
da,
da,
da.
so
send
it
back,
use
the
right
standard,
and
give
nike
a
chance
and
give
them
a
chance,
and
that
way
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
that?
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
answer
to
that
question
is
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excellent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
your
opinion,
that
you
will
win
on
remand.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
ask
nike,
i
suppose,
nike
could
say,
you
know,
i
read
the
page
73
and
you
changed
things
at
the
rate
of
mile
a
minute,
and
we
looked
at
yums
and
jelly
bean
and
they're
sort
of
like
our
shoe
but
we
didn't
think
enough,
but
you
did
think
enough,
and
are
some
of
these
changes
that
could
happen
at
a
mile
a
minute
--
is
there
any
reason
to
think,
you
know,
that
they
won't
look
really
colorably
even
like
what
you
just
did,
but
nonetheless
is
a
pretty
good
point
that
they
might
infringe
our
--
our
present
trademark.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
long
question,
i
don't
know
if
i'll
get
a
good
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that.
but
i
thought
your
response
to
justice
kennedy
was
a
different
one.
i
liked
it
because
it
was
that
--
the
concern
that
nike
can
go
and
find
out
the
competitor's
plans
is
true,
but
it
exists
whenever
a
--
a
--
a
manufacturer
brings
a
trademark
infringement
case,
because
that
manufacturer
has
to
show
he
is
now
making
the
product;
or
if
not,
he
intends
to.
and
if
it's
a
question
of
intends
to,
then
the
defendant
can
go
and
look
and
see
if
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
response,
i
took
it,
to
that
was
there
are
procedures
that
deal
with
that,
they're
called
protective
orders,
and
so
is
that
--
have
i
got
that
right
with
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
your
argument
is,
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so,
look,
how
are
you
hurt
then?
because
suppose
he
wins
here.
now,
you,
if
you
have
the
president
of
the
company
say,
hey,
i'm
going
to
do
an
exact
copy,
go
bring
a
--
go
bring
a
cancellation
action.
if
you
can't
quite
say
that,
you
know,
you
can
start
one
--
you
can't
quite
say
that,
but
he
says
something
sort
of
vague
about
it
that's
close,
go
to
the
pto.
and
if
he
can't
say
anything
like
that
at
all,
well,
then,
maybe
you
should
lose.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
--
what's
the
practical
problem
with
that?
