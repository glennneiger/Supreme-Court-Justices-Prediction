justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
--
if
i
were
to
write
an
--
an
opinion
indicating
that
there's
a
chill
here
because
distributors
and
retailers
will
see
that
there's
been
this
suit
against
the
--
your
client
and
they
will
be
reluctant
to
distribute,
would
there
--
would
i
just
make
that
up,
or
is
there
something
i
can
read
to
find
out
--
find
that
out,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
the
evidence
here
was
that
they
did
need
investors,
and
investors
were
reluctant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
wasn't
specific
evidence,
but
then
i
--
anything
besides
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
is
that
--
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you
said
it's
incredibly
costly
to
do
this
and
so
forth,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
it
makes
sense,
but
i
--
i'm
a
little
reluctant
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
shoe
business.
i
mean--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
would
think
that
you
would
add
this
as
well,
that
for
a
competitor
to
demand
that
the
other
competitor
tell
its
plans,
its
marketing,
is,
to
say
the
least,
patronizing,
and
--
and
probably
quite
injurious
in
and
of
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
again,
there's
--
do
i
just
know
that
because
i'm
a
judge,
or
is
there
someplace
i
can
look
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
we
say
there
is
just
a
presumption
that
if
you're
in
the
business
that
you
probably
are
interested
in
future
design,
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wouldn't
establish
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
its
future
--
its
future
shoes
are
clearly,
and
i
thought
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
might
have
added
this
in
his
answer
to
justice
sotomayor,
that
its
future
shoes
are
not
covered
by
this.
and
if
nike
has
the
heavy
burden
of
proof,
can
it
have
discovery
and
take
depositions
on
what
their
plans
are,
what
their
marketing
plans
are,
what
designs
they're
thinking
about?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
covenant
not
to
sue
gives
nike
an
advantage
that
no
other
manufacturer
has.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
mean
any
manufacturer
without
--
without
any
litigation
can
ask
already,
well,
tell
us
your
plans,
what
shoes
are
you
thinking
about?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
should
already
have
to
do
that
to
anybody?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
nike
has
an
advantage
over
already
that
no
other
manufacturers
had.
it
can
demand
what
its
future
plans
are.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just
ask
one
question
on
that,
and
it's
a
little
bit
off
of
what
we've
been
talking
about.
you
say
in
your
brief,
well,
now
don't
worry.
what
you
can
do
is
you
can
go
to
the
trademark,
the
pto
board,
and
they'll
adjudicate
this
mark.
and
so,
you
know,
you
can
really
go
out
of
the
courts
and
go
to
the
administrators.
suppose
already
goes
to
the
administrative
agency
and
loses,
can
it
have
judicial
review?
and
is
there
--
is
standing
easier
to
show
once
there
has
been
an
adverse
action
in
the
administrative
office?
or
are
we
right
back
where
we
started,
so
once
you
go
to
the
agency
and
you
try
to
appeal,
the
court
says,
well,
this
is
an
article
iii
court,
we
need
a
case
of
controversy,
and
you're
right
back
where
we
are
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
a
big
part
of
your
argument.
you
were
telling
us,
oh,
don't
worry,
you
can
always
go
to
the
patent
level.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
--
my
question
is,
is
the
article
iii
requirement
that
already
has
the
same
in
this
case
as
it
would
be
if
they
sought
judicial
review
from
an
adverse
order
of
the
administrative
agency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
going
to
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
--
is
--
is
the
petitioner
--
do
you
anticipate
that
the
petitioner
will
agree
with
you,
that
this
covers
future
products?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
two
categories.
you
have
current
and
previous
as
to
which
the
covenant
runs
to
everything.
then
you
have
what
you
say
is
future,
and
that
has
to
be
a
colorable
imitation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
--
so
it
--
so
it
does
cover
some
future
designs,
and
they're
correct
about
that
and
you're
incorrect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
because
it
usually
sues.
page
114
of
the
joint
appendix
says,
"your
honor,
over
the
past
8
months
nike
has
cleared
out
the
worst
offending
infringers.
"
"now
already
remains
as
one
of
the
last
few
companies
that
was
identified
on
that
top
ten
list
of
infringers.
"
i
mean,
that
--
that's
your
company's
policy,
that's
your
attorney,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
because
you
gave
them
the
covenant
after
you
sued
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
are
on
the
top
ten
list
of
infringers.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
--
you
referred
just
in
a
fleeting
way
to
the
fact
that
they
can
go
to
the
pto
and
to
the
board.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
my
question,
and
i
wasn't
--
it
was
probably
my
fault--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
didn't
quite
understand
the
government's
petition.
is
the
standing
burden
any
less
after
there
is
a
--
an
administrative
adjudication
and
you
go
to
court
for
judicial
review?
