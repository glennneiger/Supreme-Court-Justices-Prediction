justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
dabney,
are
you
saying
that
this
device
of
the
unilateral
covenant
is
no
good
unless
it
says
that
you
will
never
be
sued
for
any
shoe
that
you
ever
produce?
is
--
are
you
saying
that
the
covenant
is
no
good,
or
that
this
covenant
is
deficient?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
if
--
if
you
are
uneasy
about
the
covenant
as
it
exists,
why
didn't
you
say,
judge,
this
covenant
doesn't
give
us
adequate
protection,
it
should
be
amended,
and
then
say
what
you
think
you
need
to
be
adequately
covered?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dabney,
that's
a
different
answer
than
the
one
you
gave
me
when
i
asked
the
same
question.
you
said,
because
we
don't
want
to
be
an
involuntary
licensee
of
nike.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
can
you
--
can
you
just
explain
to
me,
you've
given
a
name
to
this
carte
blanche
that
--
that
nike
would
give
you.
what
is
the
significance
of
your
being
an
involuntary
licensee?
it's
not
something
that
you
wear
as
a
brand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
going
back
to
saying
the
covenant
--
no
covenant
is
any
good.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dabney,
suppose
there
had
been
no
infringement
claim,
could
you
have
--
but
you're
in
the
shoe
business
and
you're
worried,
could
you
have
brought
a
declaratory
action
or
an
action
for
an
injunction
to
have
the
trademark
declared
invalid?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
you
could
not
have
brought
a
suit
to
cancel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
dabney,
you
told
me
you
could
not
bring
such
an
independent
suit,
you
have
to
be
stoned
once.
so
you
can
bring
it
as
a
counterclaim,
as
you
did
here,
once
there's
an
infringement
suit,
but
you
did
say
that
you
could
not
just
walk
into
court
and
say,
i
want
an
injunction
invalidating
the
trademark.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
anders,
you
did
say,
if
i
recall
correctly,
that
congress
regarded
the
pto
as
the
preferred
form
for
cancellation
proceedings.
the
statute
sets
up
the
pto
proceeding,
but
it
also
allows
the
claim
to
be
brought
in
court.
so
what
--
what
shows
that
congress
meant
these
claims
to
be
--
to
go
to
the
agency
in
preference
to
the
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
how
the
case
came
to
us,
how
this
case
originated
was
a
counterclaim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
at
the
time
the
counterclaim
was
asserted
there
was
certainly
article
iii
jurisdiction
over
the
counterclaim,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
--
so
it's
a
question
of
--
of
deficiency
in
their
pleading.
suppose
they
amended
that
counterclaim
and
said,
as
soon
as
we
are
able,
we
want
to
do
a
counterfeit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
i
know
you
said
that
in
your
brief,
but
if
you
give
it
--
yes,
if
you
--
if
you
say
the
--
the
whole
world
can
copy
it.
but
this
covenant
would
give
it
to
only
one
manufacturer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
would
you
abandon
--
why
would
giving
a
covenant
to
already
amount
to
abandonment
of
your
mark?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
can
you
inform
us
of
when
this
practice
of
the
unilateral
covenant
in
order
to
moot
a
--
a
cancellation
claim,
when
--
how
long
has
it
been
around?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
what
about
federal
rule
41(a)(2)?
it
says
if
the
defendant
has
pleaded
a
counterclaim,
and
you
have
recognized
that
there
was
article
iii
jurisdiction
over
that
counterclaim,
the
case
may
be
dismissed
on
the
plaintiff's
request
over
the
defendant's
objection
only
if
the
counterclaim
can
remain
pending
for
independent
adjudication.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
on
the
face
of
it,
it
seems
that
that
rule
fits
this
case
to
a
t;
that
is,
the
--
plaintiff
wants
the
case
withdrawn,
defendant
objects,
and
the
question
is
can
the
counterclaim
remain
pending
for
independent
adjudication.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
interject
just
one
thing
that
i
would
like
you
to
clarify?
justice
breyer
started
out
by
saying
the
standard
comes
from
friends
of
the
earth.
do
you
agree?
because,
as
i
recall,
your
brief
doesn't
--
doesn't
even
cite
friends
of
the
earth.
