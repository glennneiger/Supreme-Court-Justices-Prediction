mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
trademark
holder
can
moot
a
declaratory
judgment
action
seeking
to
invalidate
a
trademark
by
offering
the
plaintiff
a
sufficiently
broad
covenant
not
to
sue.
whether
the
covenant
eliminates
the
controversy
between
the
parties
should
be
analyzed
under
the
voluntary
cessation
doctrine.
the
analysis
that
the
government
is
proposing
is
both
a
way
of
determining
whether
the
covenant
has
eliminated
any
concrete
dispute
between
the
parties
and
also
a
framework
for
the
parties
to
use
to
negotiate
the
appropriate
scope
of
the
covenant.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
once
the
--
once
the
defendant
offers
the
covenant,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
there
is
anything
that
the
plaintiff
is
intending
to
do,
its
current
activities
or
its
concrete
plans
for
anticipated
activities
that
would
fall
outside
the
covenant
and
potentially
be
infringing.
because
if
those
activities
exist,
then
the
covenant
has
not--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
presumption
would
establish
a
concrete
interest.
the
question
here
is
whether--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--it
would
not
establish
that
the
plaintiff
has
a
concrete
interest.
the
question
is
whether
the
dispute
between
the
parties
is
reasonably
likely
to
recur,
and
if
the
plaintiff
cannot
point
to
anything
that
it's
currently
doing
or
that
it's
planning
to
do--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
what
they
have
to
do
is
they
have
to
state
that
they
intend
to
make
products
that
may
be
outside
the
covenant,
and
now--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
the
--
the
affidavit
says
that
they
intend
to
produce
new
shoes
as
a
general
matter.
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
those
shoes
may
be,
whether
they
--
it
doesn't
give
us
a
way
of
knowing
whether
they
might
fall
outside
the
covenant.
and
i--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that
could
depend
on
the
breadth
of
the
covenant.
i
think
in
some
cases,
for
instance,
if
the
covenant
doesn't
cover
any
future
products,
it
may
be
enough
for
the
plaintiff
to
credibly
allege
we
intend
to
make
future
products
that
aren't
covered.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
so
i
also
think
that
it
may
depend
--
the
less
far
along
a
party's
plans
are
to
make
its
shoes,
the
easier
it
will
be
for
the
defendant
to
say
it
is
speculative
that
your
plans
will
actually
mature
into
something
that
doesn't--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that's
right.
i
think
if
the
parties
went
back
on
remand
in
this
case,
and
we
do
think
there
should
be
a
remand
here,
but
if
the
parties
went
back
and
we
had
the
exact
same
facts
and
nike
said
that
anything
that
was
a
colorable
imitation
of
already's
shoes
was
covered
by
the
covenant
and
already
came
back
and
said,
just
generally,
we're
making
new
shoes,
i
think
in
that
situation
it
would
be
relatively
easy
for
nike
to
show
that
the
possibility
that
already
would
be
impacted
by
the
covenant
--
or
impacted
by
the
trademark,
i'm
sorry
--
would
be
speculative.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
there
are
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
when
this
court
establishes
a
new
standard,
it
often,
it
traditionally
will
remand
to
allow
the
courts,
the
lower
courts
to
apply
that
standard
in
the
first
instance.
and
the
second
is
that
there
was
some
uncertainty
about
what
the
covenant
meant
below.
so
nike
represented
that
the
covenant
covered
the
existing
shoes
and
already
said
in
its
motion
to
dismiss
briefing
that
it
thought
that
the
covenant
did
not--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
think
that
would
be
one
way
for
nike
to
try
to
establish
that
the
dispute
is
not
reasonably
likely
to
recur.
it
could
get
discovery
into--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--i
don't
think
it
does
give
the--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
once
already
produces
--
once
already
identifies
what
its
future
activities
may
be
--
and,
again--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
we
think
it
makes
sense
for
already
to
have
to
--
have
to
at
least
identify
here
what
activities
it
thinks
may
not
be
outside
the
covenant,
and
i
don't
think
that
hurts
already,
and
the
reason
is
that
if
already's
evidence
convinces
the
court
that
the
case
isn't
moot,
then
already
gets
its
adjudication
on
the
related--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
it
will
get
--
the
trademark
will
be
adjudicated
if
already
convinces
the
court
the
action
isn't--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--well,
a
couple
of
points
on
that.
the
first
is
that
we
are
not
proposing
that
the
court
should
dismiss
discretionarily
every
action
just
because
the
ttab
exists
and
can
adjudicate--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--what
we're
proposing
here
is
that
as
a
function
of
the
court's
broader
discussion
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
united
states
v.
w.
t.
grant
is
that
when
the
court
believes
that
it
probably
does
have
jurisdiction
but
it
doesn't
think
that
the
likelihood
of
a
dispute
is
--
is
really
that
great,
that
in
that
situation
it
can
discretionarily
dismiss.
so
that
would
be
a
situation
in
which
there
is
article
iii--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--the
administrative
agency's
standing
rules
are
broader
than
article
iii,
so
it
would
--
it
is
easier
to
get--
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
--and
so
once
it
goes
to
court,
there
may
be
rare
cases
in
which
already,
as
the
party
that
lost,
if
it
isn't
injured
in
fact
by
the
ttab's
decision
itself,
that
it
would
not
have
the
necessary
article
iii
injury
to
seek
judicial
review.
that
hasn't
--
to
our
knowledge,
that
has
not
occurred,
but
it
is
possible
that
that
could
happen
because
15
u.s.c.
1064
makes
the
ttab
standing
requirements
broader
than
is
in
article
iii.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
well,
i
think
congress
didn't
set
it
up
as
an
exhaustion
requirement,
so
i
don't
think
it's
that
congress
preferred
for
all
of
these
claims
to
go
to
the
ttab,
but
the
ttab
is
the
expert
body
that
--
that
adjudicates
cancellation
of
validity
issues
all
the
time.
so
we
think
there
could
be
circumstances
in
which
it
would
be
particularly
appropriate
for
a
district
court
to
consider
the
existence
of
the
ttab
proceeding.
for
instance,
if
there's
a
related
proceeding
pending
before
the
ttab
or
there's
a
concurrent
proceeding,
something
like
that,
we
think
it
would
make
sense
for
the
district
court
in
considering
whether
to
dismiss
the
action
to
take
that
into
account.
ms.
ginger
d.
anders
i
think
there
could
be
some
circumstances
in
which
the
ttab's
decision
would
create
injury-in-fact
if
it
said
something
about
the
scope
of
the
trademark,
something
like
that.
so
there
could
be
situations
in
which
1071
would
then
allow
the
losing
party
to
get
judicial
review.
