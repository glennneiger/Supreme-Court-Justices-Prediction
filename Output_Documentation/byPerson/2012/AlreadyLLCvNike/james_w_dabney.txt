mr.
james
w.
dabney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
article
iii
question
in
this
case
turns
on
resolution
of
two
issues:
first,
whether
loss
of
freedom
to
operate
on
the
part
of
a
direct
competitor
qualifies
as
article
iii
injury
in
fact;
and
second,
what
party
bears
the
burden
of
proof
of
facts
that
are
contended
by
it
to
render
a
claim
moot.
the
counterclaim
in
this
case
seeks
to
extinguish
a
source
of
cost,
risk,
and
official
restraint
on
what
footwear
products
the
petitioner
can
and
cannot
legally
sell.
these
are
classic
forms
of
injury
in
fact.
on
the
burden
of
proof
point,
the
proponent
of
a
factual
contention
always
bears
the
burden
of
proving
this,
and
this
is
especially
true,
and
the
question
arises
in
the
context
of
a
claim
that
a
voluntary
act
has
allegedly
ousted
a
federal
court
of
jurisdiction.
mootness
doctrine
protects
a
party
seeking
relief
from
the
kind
of
evasive
maneuvering
that's
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
injury
in
fact
is
a
question
of
fact,
and
injury
in
fact
is
based
on
evidence.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
there
are
three
forms
of
injury
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
petitioner's
cost
of
operation
is
increased
because
the
disputed
claim
was
not
expunged.
when
the
petitioner
designs
and
sells
new
products,
it
has
to
go
through
an
incredibly
costly
process
to
determine
whether
or
not
its
next
line
of
shoes
might
give
rise
to
a
plausible
claim--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--it
certainly
is.
the
petitioner
says
through
its
president,
on
page
173
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
he's
engaged
in
new
development
of
new
shoe
lines,
which
by
definition
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
covenant
document.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that
specific
statement
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
your
honor,
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
up,
because
under
the
mootness
doctrine,
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
and
every
other
fact
relevant
to
mootness
fell
on
the
respondent.
under
this
court's
precedents,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
in
order
to
oust
the
district
court
of
jurisdiction,
had
to
show
two
things
to
a
high
degree
of
probability:
the
first
thing
the
respondent
had
to
show
is
that
it
was
absolutely
clear
that
the
petitioner
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
bring--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--page
173a
of
the
record
of
the
joint
appendix
states
that
the
petitioner
is
intending
--
is
regularly
engaged
in
the
design
of
new
footwear.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
your
honor,
in
the
real
world,
a
business
competitor--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
record
does
not
show
that
the
petitioner
lacks
any
concrete
interest
in
entering
the
line
of
commerce
that--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--your
honor,
what
the
record
shows,
and
it
is
what
it
is,
is
that
the
petitioner
is
actively
engaged
in
designing
and
bringing
out
new
footwear
products--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--period.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
when
you
apply
the
mootness
doctrine,
since
we're
not
talking
about
picking
a
fight
here,
we're
talking
about
someone
who
was
sued
once
--
once
bitten,
twice
shy
--
that
when
someone
has
been
sued
for
alleged
infringement
has
asked
for
a
judgment
that
would
eliminate
any
need
to
think
about
whether
or
not
a
new
shoe
will
attract--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--exactly.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
exactly.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that
would
itself
be--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
law
is
that
as
i
stand
here
today,
the
government
has
registered
a
claim
that
the
petitioner
is
duty
bound
not
to
bring
out
the
shoe
shown
in
the
registration,
number
one,
which
according
to
the
respondent
is
one
of
the
best
selling,
most
profitable
shoe
styles
of
all
time;
and
also,
as
i
stand
here
today,
the
law
is
that
petitioner
is
at
risk
if
it
brings
out
a
shoe
that
is
going
to
be
giving
rise
to
a
plausible
claim--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--i'm
saying
that
the
respondent
bore
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
covenant
completely
and
irrevocably
eradicated
all
the
facts.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
because
the
petitioner
asks
for
judgment
in
accordance
with
law,
and
it
would
prefer
not
to
be
the
involuntary
licensee
of
the
respondent
that
sued
it.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
your
honor,
again--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--not
--
no--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--that's
--
that's
not
actually
right.
the
reason
why
--
70
years
ago,
learned
hand
created
the
metaphor
the
scarecrow
patent.
and
the
reason
scarecrows
are
effective
is
not
because
they
are
likely
to
climb
down
from
the
pole,
but
because
from
a
distance
and
being
looked
at
quickly,
the
way
people
in
the
marketplace
have
to
react
to
official
government
records
of
claims,
they're
deceptive.
so--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--your
honor,
the
covenant
actually
reasserts
the
allegation
that
these
shoes
infringe.
the
covenant
does
nothing
more
than
purport
to
waive--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--it
says
it
right
on
the
--
on
page,
i
believe
it
is
96
of
the
record
where
it
says,
in
the
second
whereas,
"the
actions
complained
of
no
longer
infringe
or
dilute
at
a
level
sufficient
to
warrant
the
substantial
time
and
expense.
"
i
mean,
it
libels--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--there
would
be
one
small
little
less
bit
of
injury
in
this
case.
that's--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--when
someone
seeks--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--no.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the
practice
in
this
case
dates
to
1995.
this
is
a
totally
recent,
controversial
practice
that
has
never
been
embraced
by
this
court
at
all.
in
fact,
it
was
articulated
in
a
case
two
years
after--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
reason
is,
your
honor,
that
the
registration
causes
informational
injury,
and
what
the
respondent
is
trying
to
do
is
to
hang
on
to
government
action
that
disadvantages
its
competitor
while--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
question
the
trademark
practitioners
get
asked
every
day
is
whether
something
is
available,
and
so
long
as
that
question
is
asked,
a
covenant
that's
in
the
file
of
a
company
is
not
going
to
prevent
deception
and
confusion
of
people
who
look
and
say,
oh,
this
is
a
protected
design.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
that
is
a
second
form
of
injury
that
we
have
now,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out.
right
now
we
cannot
just
ignore
the
claim
and
bring
out
either
this
--
a
yums
version--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--what
we've
substituted
is
instead
of
getting
a
judgment
in
accordance
with
law
that
expunges
the
allegedly
invalid
government-registered
claim
of
right
to
exclude
competition
and
sale
of
goods
in
favor
of
the
chance
to
litigate
with
our
arch
rival
to
see
whether
they
will
prove--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--a
covenant
that
leaves
the
covenantor
in
possession
of
the
unreviewed
government
benefit
that
it
got--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the
claim
the
counterclaim
seeks
to
extinguish
is
not
simply
the
particular
rights
of
action
that
they
have
covenanted
not
to
exert.
the
claim
that
is
sought
to
be
extinguished
is
the
much
broader
government-registered
claim
of
right
to
exclude
competition
in
the
sale
of
shoes
that
embody
that
design.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
yes.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
i
would
say
we
have
very
distinct
and
concrete
and
palpable
injury
in
that--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--no.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
it
is
undeniable
by
law
that
the
petitioner's
cost
of
operation,
the
petitioner's
risk
of
operation
is
increased
because
of--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--yes,
but
we're
a
direct
competitor
which
we
say
is
currently
subject
to
an
unlawful
restraint
on
our
freedom
to
operate.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
when
our
shoes
were
launched,
it
obviously
never
even
occurred
to
the
petitioner
that
they
could
be
deemed
an
infringement
of
any
rights
of
this
respondent.
so
the
answer
is
we
were
not
injured
at
that
point.
but
now
that
we've
been
sued
--
once
bitten,
twice
shy
--
we
now
have
been
told
by
the
respondent
that
it
claims
a
far-reaching
claim
of
right
to
exclude
competition
in
the
sale
of
goods.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the
three-part
test
of
injury-in-fact
is
universally
applicable.
so
we
did
not
allege
and
i
don't
believe
we
had
injury-in-fact
when
our
shoes
were
launched.
so,
no,
of
course
there
would
not
have
been
a
suit
that
could
be
brought
at
that
time.
but
since
we're
in
a
mootness
case
and
we've
been
sued
and
we've
been
told
and
have
all
these
defamatory
allegations
about
and
dragged
our
company's
name
through
the
mud,
the
situation
is
different,
as
your
honor
has
said.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
if
the,
as
i
said
before,
if
the
only
injury
we
were
complaining
about
and
trying
to
extinguish
was
the
injury
that
flows
from
being
sued
again
by
this
respondent,
then
i
suppose
you
could
--
you
could
conceive
of
a
covenant
that
would
extinguish
that
injury.
but
in
trademark
registration
practice,
it
has
been
routinely
heard
by
federal
courts
--
we
cite
two
on
page
8
of
our
reply
brief
--
that
the
kind
of
injury
that
petitioner
is
complaining
about
in
this
case
has
been
heard
and
adjudicated
by
federal
courts
for
decades.
we
cite
two
cases
85
years
apart.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
well,
let
me
clarify.
the
petitioner
totally
agrees
there
has
to
be
injury
in
fact
in
all
cases.
and
so
my
answer
to
your
question
in
this
hypothetical
question
is,
we
would
have
to
allege
adequate
injury.
and
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
increased
cost
of
capital
might
or
might
not
qualify
for
injury
in
the
initial
standing
case
where--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--might
not,
that's
right.
[laughter]
so
we
have
increased
cost
of
capital,
increased
costs
of
--
of
design,
and,
of
course,
we
have
the
legal
burden
and
duty
to
refrain
from
making
shoes
now
that
would
give
rise
to
a
plausible
claim
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
your
honor,
the
covenant
--
the
affidavits
in
this
case
were
prepared
about
five
weeks
after
this
completely
unexpected
development
in
the
middle
of
a
hard
pressed
litigation
was
made,
and
the
position
that
the
petitioner
made
to
the
district
court
was
there
is
obviously
subject
matter
jurisdiction
here,
not
just
because
of
the
rule
41
point,
but
that
you
can't
say,
well,
we
have
a
case
that
raises
these
three
issues,
you
could,
say,
enter
a
single
judgment
right
now,
the
plaintiff's
claims
are
waived
because
they've
waived
them,
the
trademark
is
invalid,
and
the
registration
was
unlawfully
issued
and
should
be
granted.
courts
issue
judgments
on
the
basis
of
alternative
holdings
all
the
time,
and
the
only
reason
why
we're
even
talking
about
this
is
that
judge
sullivan
bifurcated
the
proceedings
so
that
we
dealt
with
this
one
issue
in
isolation
and
then
the
other
thing
came
up
separately.
so
we
said
we
think
there's
a
case
right
now,
but
if
you
doubt
it,
we
request
leave
to
amend
our
counterclaim
to
assert
claims
for
invalid
procurement
of
registration
and
other
things
that
could
have
been
asserted.
so
the
state
of
the
record
reflects
the
--
the
suddenness
with
which
the
--
the
plaintiff
most
unexpectedly
did
what
it
now
says
in
public
it's
never
done
before
and
dropped
its
claim
so
unexpectedly
in
the
case.
so
there's
no
question
but
that
if
--
if
it
turns
out
that
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
we're
actively
engaged
and
we
want
to
do
all
of
the
things
any
person
in
a
normal
position
would
want
to
do,
and
we
have
a
concrete
interest,
the
--
the
defendant
can
certainly
allege
more
than
what
it
has
been
alleged.
the--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--your
honor,
the
petitioner
has
been
trying
now
for
two
and
a
half
years
to
establish
its
right
to
do
that.
it
was
not
our
understanding
that,
under
the
law
as
it
stood,
that
the
--
in
addition
to
saying
we
have
an
enormous
commercial
interest
in
doing
this,
and
we
are
seeking
the
right
to
do
this
since--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--the
commercial
interest
is
to
partake
of
this
very
large
and
lucrative
business
that
the
respondent's
evidence
shows
in
this
case.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
i
--
i
think
it
is
--
first
of
all,
the
petitioner,
up
until
now,
has
said
what
he
said.
i
could
stand
here
and
say
i
believe
that
if
the
registration
were
cancelled,
it
is
highly
likely
that
the
petitioner
would
bring
out
a
yums
shoe.
mr.
james
w.
dabney
the
practical
problem
here
is
that
in
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case,
which
is
analogous
to
a
summary
judgment
situation,
all
inferences,
all
reasonable
inferences
need
to
be
drawn
in
favor
of
the
nonmoving
party.
the
suggestion
that
we
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
the
record
is
completely
incorrect.
there
wasn't
even
oral
argument
on
this
motion.
the
district
court
never
gave
us
any
opportunity
to
put
in
evidence
other
than
to
come
in
and
say
we
have
what
we
believe
is
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
now,
rule
41(a)(2)
precludes
you
from
dismissing
our
counterclaim,
but
if
you
think
what
we've
alleged
now
is
not
enough,
we
request
leave
to
amend
our
pleading.
so
to
force
us
to
start
all
over
again
in
a
new
suit
is
--
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
to
the
petitioner,
and
what
we're
seeking
here
is
simply
judicial
review.
we're
seeking
the
--
the
ability
to
obtain
extinguishment
not
just
of
the
particular
claims
that
this
plaintiff
saw
fit
to
waive,
but
the
much
broader
government-registered
claim
of
right
to
exclude
competition
in
the
sale
of
shoes,
and
the
fact
that--
mr.
james
w.
dabney
--thank
you.
