but
why?
justice
elena
kagan
but
that's
not
the
question,
mr.
dabney.
the
question
is,
is
there
any
covenant
that
exists
in
the
world
that
would
make
you
feel
secure?
and
i
suppose
i'm
having
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
with
the
answer,
with
an
answer
that
says:
no,
there
is
no
covenant
that
you
can
write
that
would
make
us
feel
secure.
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
that's
the
case,
if
the
difference
is
that
you've
been
sued,
then
it
should
be
adequate
protection
if
you
know
that
you
won't
be
sued
again,
and
that's
why
there's
the
question
of
what
kind
of
covenant
would
give
you
adequate
protection
that
you
won't
be
sued
again.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
ms.
anders,
take
this
case
where
already
says,
you
know,
we're
not
really
going
to
say
anything
particular.
we're
just
going
to
say
that
we're
in
the
business
of
making
shoes,
and
we
might
make
a
shoe.
would
that
--
would
that
--
that
would
not
be
enough
under
your
standard;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
given
what
already
has
said
in
this
case,
why
is
it
that
you
think
that
we
should
remand?
i
mean,
it
sounds
as
though
we're
remanding
for
no
purpose,
given
what
already
has
said
throughout
the
course
of
the
litigation
and,
indeed,
in
this
court
today.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
that
this
covenant
covers
an
exact
copy
of
your
shoe?
justice
elena
kagan
but
suppose
in
a
different
hypothetical
case
they
had
said,
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
copy
nike's
shoes--
justice
elena
kagan
--what
then
should
have
happened
then,
in
your
view?
