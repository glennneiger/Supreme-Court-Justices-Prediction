chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
today
in
case
11-982,
already,
llc,
d/b/a
yums
v.
nike.
mr.
dabney.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
get
a
lot
of
what
this
extra
stuff,
you
know,
that
you
say,
well,
even
if
this
is
all
right,
they're
not
going
to
sue
me
for
that,
there's
all
the
collateral
damage.
you
get
a
significant
amount
of
that
by
the
covenant
not
to
sue.
nike
can't
go
around
giving
out
these
covenants
left
and
right
because
if
they
do,
they
will
undermine
their
own
trademark.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
where
does
it
--
where
does
it
do
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
so
if
you
take
--
if
that
were
taken
out,
is
your
case
the
same
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
guess
maybe
this
is
the
same
question
justice
ginsburg
was
asking.
you're
--
you're
a
lawyer
in
this
area.
you
want
to
write
a
covenant
that
will
satisfy
the
fellow
on
the
other
side,
but
what
does
it
say?
can
you
do
that,
or
do
you
have
to
say:
the
only
way
this
case
can
be
rendered
moot
is
if
the
trademark
is
totally
invalidated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
that's
kind
of
a
yes
or
no
answer.
can
you
write
a
covenant
that
says
something
other
than
the
trademark
is
totally
invalidated?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
saying
that
in
this
case
there's
no
way
--
i
mean,
i
thought
it
was
a
practice
that
was
not
unprecedented
for
parties
to
grant
covenants
of
this
sort.
you're
saying
this
is
unheard
of,
nobody
can
do
this?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
dabney--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
you
had
the
various
interests
that
you're
asserting
now
--
we're
not
talking
about
mootness,
but
we're
talking
about
article
iii
standing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
what
you're
alleging,
that
you
have
plans
to
introduce
particular
shoes.
people
are
considering
investing
in
your
company.
your
opponent
has
intimidated
retailers.
if
you
brought
a
suit
by
yourself,
is
that
sufficient
to
establish
article
iii
standings?
are
those
the
sort
of
concrete
and
tangible
injuries
that
we've
required?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
because
you
plan
to
introduce
a
particular
line
of
shoes,
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
okay.
just
because
people
are
considering
investing
--
somebody
who
came
in
and
said,
i've
got
this
company,
people
are
thinking
of
investing
in
it,
and
therefore
you
want
to
proceed
with
your
lawsuit?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
surely
would
not
establish
article
iii
standings.
everybody's
cost
of
operation
is
increased
whenever
there's
any
trademark
at
all
because
you
have
to
check
and
see
whether
it
violates
a
trademark.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
suggest
it
might
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
anders.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
might
be
that
the
--
an
adverse
decision
from
the
agency
covering
you
is
an
additional
injury,
in
fact,
that
gives
you
article
iii
standing,
unless
the
--
unless
the
basis
for
the
agency's
decision
is
you
don't
have
any
injury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
could
you
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
and
answer
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dabney,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
case
no.
11-982
already,
llc
versus
nike
incorporated.
under
the
constitution,
federal
courts
are
limited
to
deciding
actual
cases
or
controversies.
they
do
not
sit
to
resolve
academic
or
hypothetical
disputes.
this
case
began
as
a
real
one.
the
question
is
whether
it
became
simply
an
academic
dispute
and
therefore
had
to
be
dismissed.
the
parties
to
the
case
are
two
corporations,
nike
and
already.
they
each
design
and
market
athletic
shoes.
nike
sued
already
claiming
that
two
of
already's
shoe
designs
violated
nike's
air
force
1
trademark.
already
counterclaimed
arguing
that
the
air
force
1
trademark
was
invalid
in
the
first
place.
nike
backed
off
and
issued
a
covenant
not
to
sue.
basically,
an
enforceable
promise
that
it
would
never
again
claim
that
already's
current
shoes
were
imitations
of
those
shoes
violate
nike's
air
force
1
trademark.
now,
nike
argues
that
this
covenant
means
that
the
case
is
over
and
everyone
can
go
home.
according
to
nike,
the
only
injury
the
trademark
imposed
on
already
was
a
threat
that
already
would
be
sued
for
infringing
that
trademark,
but
that
threat
vanished
when
nike
dismissed
its
own
suit
and
promised
not
to
file
a
suit
like
it
had
against
already
ever
again.
our
precedents
established
that
someone
trying
to
end
a
lawsuit
by
voluntarily
stopping
what
it
was
sued
for
doing
must
meet
what
we
have
called
a
formidable
test,
the
voluntary
cessation
test.
now,
under
that
test,
we
have
said,
a
party
claiming
that
its
voluntary
compliance
moots
a
case
causes
it
to
end
has
to
show,
and
this
a
quote,
that
it
is
absolutely
clear,
the
allegedly
wrongful
behavior
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
recur.
the
reason
for
such
a
rigorous
test
is
clear.
you
do
not
want
parties
who
are
sued
to
be
able
to
stop
their
allegedly
wrongful
conduct
and
have
the
case
against
them
dismissed
and
then
start
up
all
over
again
repeating
the
process
if
necessary
until
they
accomplish
their
wrongful
ends.
in
this
case,
nike's
covenant
meets
the
voluntary
cessation
standard.
as
written,
it
is
unconditional
and
irrevocable.
beyond
simply
prohibiting
nike
from
filing
suit,
it
prohibits
nike
from
making
any
claim
or
any
demand.
it
reaches
beyond
already
to
protect
already's
distributors
and
customers
and
it
covers
not
just
current
or
previous
designs
but
in
a
colorable
imitations
of
those.
it
is,
all
things
considered
a
very
broad
and
categorical
covenant
promising
not
to
sue.
now,
given
the
breadth
of
this
covenant,
it
was
up
to
already
to
indicate
that
it
has
plans
to
create
shoes
that
arguably
infringed
the
air
force
1
trademark
but
are
not
protected
by
the
covenant.
in
other
words,
already
needed
to
indicate
that
it
still
face
the
threat
of
a
lawsuit
in
which
nike
alleges
that
already
shoes
are
violating
the
air
force
1
trademark.
but
despite
the
opportunity
and
despite
being
asked,
already
never
asserted
any
such
plans
in
the
district
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
before
us.
instead,
already
argued
that
it
continued
to
suffer
other
injuries
even
with
the
covenant
in
place.
now,
the
problem
for
already
is
that
none
of
the
injuries
it
asserted
is
enough
to
keep
the
case
in
federal
court.
for
example,
already
contends
that
so
long
as
nike
keeps
its
trademark,
investors
will
be
apprehensive
about
investing
in
already,
but
the
fact
that
some
investors
will
remain
skittish
about
investing
in
already
even
though
there
is
no
reasonable
prospect
that
nike
can
sue
already
again,
cannot
be
enough
to
keep
the
case
live.
we
have
never
held
that
such
speculative
concern
of
investors
is
enough
to
support
standing.
next,
already
contends
that
given
nike's
decision
to
sue
in
the
first
place,
nike's
trademarks
will
now
hang
over
already's
head.
as
already's
counsel
told
us
at
oral
argument,
once
bitten,
twice
shy.
but
here,
there's
no
reason
for
already
to
be
so
shy
among
nike's
competitors,
already
is
the
one
with
a
judicially
enforceable
covenant
protecting
it
from
litigation
relating
to
the
air
force
1
trademark.
finally,
already
argues
that
as
one
of
nike's
competitors,
it
inherently
has
standing
to
challenge
nike's
intellectual
property.
according
to
already,
letting
nike
moot
this
case
allows
companies
like
nike
to
register
in
brandish
invalid
trademarks
in
order
to
intimidate
smaller
competitors,
avoiding
judicial
review
by
issuing
covenants
in
the
rare
case
where
the
little
guy
fights
back.
thus,
already
argues
simply
as
one
of
nike's
competitors,
it
has
the
right
to
challenge
nike's
trademark.
under
this
approach,
even
if
nike
had
never
sued
already
and
even
if
already
had
no
plans
to
make
anything
resembling
the
air
force
1,
already
could
still
sue
to
invalidate
nike's
trademark
solely
because
already
and
nike
both
compete
in
the
athletic
footwear
market.
we
have
never
accepted
such
a
boundless
theory
of
standing.
in
essence,
already's
arguments
boiled
down
to
a
basic
policy
objection
that
dismissing
this
case,
allows
nike
to
bully
smaller
innovators,
lawfully
operating
in
the
public
domain.
now,
accepting
already's
theory
may
benefit
the
small
competitor
in
this
case,
but
lowering
the
gates
for
one
party
lowers
the
gates
for
all.
as
a
result,
bigger
companies
with
more
resources
will
have
standing
to
challenge
the
intellectual
property
portfolios
of
their
more
humble
rivals,
not
because
they're
actually
threatened
by
any
particular
patent
or
trademark,
but
simply
because
they
are
competitors
in
the
same
market.
this
would
further
encourage
parties
to
employ
litigation
as
a
weapon
against
their
competitors,
rather
than
as
a
last
resort
for
resolving
actual
disputes.
so,
already's
only
legally
cognizable
injury,
the
fact
that
nike
took
steps
against
to
enforce
its
trademark
is
now
gone
and
given
the
breadth
and
binding
nature
of
the
covenant
cannot
reasonably
be
expected
to
recur.
they're
being
no
other
basis
on
which
defined
the
live
controversy.
this
case
is
moot
and
must
be
dismissed.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justices
thomas,
alito,
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
