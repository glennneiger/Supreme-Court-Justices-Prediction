mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
very
much.
may
it
please
the
court:
you
will
want
to
have
available
to
you
the
cert
petition
and
the
small
volume
of
the
joint
appendix.
in
our
submission
the
court
needs
to
adopt
a
rule
that
has
balance
to
it,
and
that
is
there
--
it
has
to
be
possible
to
resolve
one
of
these
cases
through
a
covenant
not
to
sue
of
appropriate
breadth,
but
it
also
has
to
be
the
case
that
a
covenant
not
to
sue
can't
just
always
eliminate
the
other
side's
injury.
and
so,
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
covenant
and
it's
going
to
depend
on
what
the
other
side
says
about
its
plans.
and
our
point
in
this
case
is
that
you
should
adopt
the
following
rule:
and
that
is,
if
you
have
a
covenant
not
to
sue
and
it
covers
everything
that
the
other
side
alleges
an
intent
to
produce,
then
there
is
no
more
injury.
if
it
doesn't
cover
that,
then
there
may
well
be
injury,
and
our
point--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--absolutely.
so
one
thing
that's
very
important
to
recognize
--
two
things
about
trademark
practice.
first
is
that
in
all
of
these
cases,
remember,
most
of
the
time
the
question
of
trademark
or
patent
validity
will
just
be
a
suit
for
invalidity.
it
might
be
a
counterclaim.
this
happens
all
the
time.
and
in
all
of
these
cases,
including
this
case,
there
is
a
protective
order,
and
there
is
one
in
this
case.
and
the
protective
order
says
that
a
party
can
designate
its
material
so
that
it's
lawyers'
eyes
only,
and
so
that
no
business
person
from
the
other
side
is
entitled
to
see
it.
so
that,
justice
kennedy,
with
respect,
it's
actually
not
true
that
this
is
an
unusual
situation
or
that
we
would
get
some
special
advantage.
in
every
single
patent
or
trademark
invalidity
case,
after
this
court's
decision
in
medimmune,
the
party
alleging
invalidity
in
order
to
show
its
standing
has
to
say,
we
intend
to
make
a
product
that
is
regarded
as
potentially
infringing.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
the
answer
to
your
question
is
going
to
be
yes,
but
it
has
two
parts
to
it.
the
first
is
--
because
i
really
want
to
focus
on
precisely
what
you
said.
you
said
first,
what
did
they
simply
say?
now,
if
they
were
to
simply
say
it,
there
could
be
a
factual
inquiry
into
whether
they're
telling
the
truth
or
not.
we
could
debate.
we
could
have
a
fight
about
the
actual
evidence.
but
let's
assume
they
could
prove
it,
and
that
is,
the
district
judge
was
told
by
already
or
whatever
other
competitor,
we
want
to
make
a
counterfeit.
in
that
case,
unquestionably,
unquestionably,
there
would
be
a
continuing
article
iii
injury,
and
let's
then
go
to
your
understanding
of
what
the
declaration
in
this
case
actually
says.
so,
first,
let
me
start
with
how
the
case
came
to
you,
and
that
is
the
court
of
appeals,
what
it
understood
the
record
and
the
district
court
understood
the
record
to
be,
and
that
is
going
to
be
in
the
petition
appendix
at
page--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
absolutely
right.
and
we
accept,
for
present
purposes,
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
reduced
requirement
under
the
voluntary
cessation
doctrine.
we
briefed
why
we
don't
think
that's
true,
but
i
assume
for
the
purposes
of
these
answers,
that
the
court
is
going
to
apply
the
heightened
burden
on
us
to
show
that
the
case
is
over.
and
we
believe
that
we
showed
beyond
--
that
we
really
resolved
this
case,
when
we
didn't
really
dismiss
our
claim
with
prejudice,
but
we
affirmatively
granted
them
a
covenant
not
to
sue
that
covered
not
only
their
existing
products
but,
justice
kennedy,
their
future
products
--
and
i'm
glad
to
take
you
to
the
language
of
the
covenant
--
because
they
are
the
colorable
imitations
of
their
current
products.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
does
not.
and
if
the
other
side
had
said
in
the
district
court,
we
have
an
intention
--
and
this
is
justice
sotomayor's
point,
we
have
an
intention,
we
have
a
desire
to
make
a
copy
of
your
shoe,
then
there
would
be
a
case
or
controversy.
and
it's
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
because
although
the
cert
petition
says
that
it
doesn't,
we
have
quite
stridently
pointed
out
in
our
briefing
that
that
was
completely
inaccurate.
and
i'll
just
--
let's
go
to
the
covenant.
i
don't
think
this
is
really
that
hard
or
that
controversial.
so,
if
we
go
to
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
96
to
97,
and
so
--
and
--
and
i
remind
you
that
the
--
the
question
presented
is
--
is
exactly
what
you're
saying,
justice
kennedy.
i'll
read
it
so
you
don't
have
to
turn
back
to
the
cert
petition.
and
its
premise
was
that
the
registrant
promises
not
to
assert
its
mark
against
the
party's
then
existing
commercial
activities.
so
now
i'm
in
the
covenant
itself
on
page
97a,
and
this
is
what
we
promised
not
to
sue
them
about.
we
have
promised
not
to
sue
them,
and
i'm
five
lines
down
from
the
top,
on
account
of
any
possible
action
based
on
or
involving
trademark
infringement,
unfair
competition
or
dilution,
under
state
or
federal
law
based
on
the
appearance
of
already's
current,
okay,
that's
not
future
or
previous
footwear
product
designs
and
any
colorable
imitations.
and
that's
what
--
and
that's
what--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
are
not
colorable
imitations--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
kennedy,
i
--
i
may
have
confused
things.
this
is
the
situation
with
the
covenant.
our
covenant
not
to
sue
covers
everything
they
have
made
in
the
past,
everything
they
were
making
at
the
time
and
every
future
product
of
theirs
that
is
a
colorable
imitation.
our
point
is
not
that
it
covers
every
future
shoe
of
theirs.
we're
on
the
same
page
in
that
respect.
you
are
absolutely
right,
justice
kennedy,
that
there
are
shoes
that
they
could
make
in
the
future
that
would
not
be
covered
by
the
covenant.
there
could
be
an
injury
about
that.
and
so,
my
point
about
the
record
in
the
case
and
how
the
case
was
developed
and
how
we
might
have
modified
the
covenant
if
they
had
told
us
anything,
suggesting
--
suggested
anything
outside
the
covenant
they
might
want
to
make
is
let's
look
at
what
they
actually
told
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
about
what
their
intentions
were.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
it
is
not
a
deficiency
in
the
pleading.
it's
a
deficiency
in
the
proof.
so
my
point
about
this,
it's
very
important
for
the
court
to
understand
that
this
case
was
not
dismissed
just
on
the
pleadings.
it
wasn't
just
an
insufficiency
in
their
allegation.
and
they
said,
actually,
we
have
more
that
we
want
to
say,
because
we
actually
can
explain
to
the
courts
that
we
want
to
make
other
shoes.
the
case
was
decided
on
a
fully
developed
record.
we
moved
to
dismiss.
they
submitted
five
declarations
in
response
that
described
their
intentions
precisely.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
so
i
do
--
i
would
love
to
return
to
what
actually
happened,
but
in
that
hypothetical,
what
would
happen
is
that
our
motion
to
dismiss
would
be
denied,
unless
and
until
we
could
prove
that
what
they
were
saying
wasn't
true,
because
it
is
absolutely
the
case,
and
it
is
a
strong
point
in
our
favor,
that
you
can't
evade
an
attempt
to
invalidate
your
trademark
through
a
covenant
not
to
sue,
because
you
can't
give
a
covenant
not
to
sue
over
a
counterfeit
because
you
are
in
real
risk
of
being
deemed
to
have
abandoned
the
mark
because
you're
just--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
it
is
not
a
settled
question
in
the
law.
there
is
no
case
that
has
considered
this
question.
what
a
party
claiming
abandonment
would
say
is
that
we
would
have
licensed
already
then
to
increase
its
production
and
its
distribution,
but
even
if
one
didn't
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg,
my
point
would
be
this,
and
that
is
you
can't
continually
evade
an
attempt
to
invalidate
your
mark,
because
certainly
the
degree
--
we
would
agree
that
if
you
give
a
second
one
of
these
things
out
or
the
third
one,
you
would
be
abandoning
the
mark.
i
have
some
actual
facts
for
you
about
this,
and
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
page
173
of
the
joint
appendix.
they
had
every
opportunity
to
describe
exactly
what
you
wanted
to
know
about,
justice
breyer.
we
moved
to
dismiss
the
case--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
that
would
be
fine.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
and
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--they're
going
to
win.
they're
going
to
win,
justice
sotomayor;
and
so
for
your
vote,
i
am
resting
my
entire
case
on
the
fact
that
you're
understanding
that
this
is
what
their
affidavit
suggests
that's
just
not
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
so
page
173
--
because
there
is
a
record
here.
you
--
you
don't
have
to
hypothesize;
this
was
all
on
the
table
in
the
district
court.
we
said,
they
have
no
intention,
no
desire,
no
nothing,
to
make
something
that
is
not
unambiguously
covered
by
the
covenant;
and
justice
ginsburg
did
point
out
in
passing
that
if
they
said
something
to
the
contrary,
we
would
have
modified
the
covenant.
so
here's
what
they
said,
and
i
--
it
would
take
a
lot
of
your
time
for
me
to
read
all
seven
paragraphs
on
page
173,
but
they
don't--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--so
these
paragraphs
do
not
say
--
they
do
not
suggest,
they
do
not
imply,
even
between
the
lines,
an
intention
to
make
something
that
is
outside
the
covenant.
they
just
don't.
and
that's--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
do
you
want--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--all
right,
justice
breyer,
so
you've
got
a
choice.
you
could
let
us
win
now
or
you
could
say,
well,
maybe
you
will
win
on
remand.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
right.
[laughter]
and
justice
breyer,
i
have
two
answers
for
you.
number
one
is
going
--
the
first
one
is
going
to
be
about
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
the
second
is
just
going
to
be
jurisprudential.
the
first
one
is,
what
more
could
one
imagine
in
such
an
opinion
that
you
would
ask
nike
to
do
on
a
remand?
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
justice
breyer--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
i
hope
you'll
get
a
good
answer.
the
--
my
point
is
this,
justice
breyer:
what
you've
just
said
on
remand,
what
we
would
do
is
ask
a
question.
we
wouldn't
try
to
prove
and
anything.
my
point
is
this:
already
has
told
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
court
everything
that
it
wants
to
say
about
its
intentions.
it
has
had
every
opportunity
in
every
court
to
have
its
lawyers
simply
say,
justice
sotomayor,
this
is
not
an
accident.
the
reason
they
are
not
saying
that
they
want
to
make
a
covenant
of
the
--
a
copy
of
the
air
force
1
is
that
they
don't
want
to
make
a
copy
of
the
air
force
1.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
to
send
this
back
to
give
--
ask
already
again
the
question
that
has
been
asked
in
three
separate
courts.
i
said
i
had
a
jurisprudential
answer
to
you
as
well,
and
that
is
the
case
was
presented
to
you
as
presenting
a
question
of
law,
and
that
is,
can
you
have
a
covenant
not
to
sue
that
will
end
a
case
like
this?
and
if
you
tell
the
lower
courts,
we
don't
know,
you
are
doing,
i
think,
not
as
much
of
a
service
to
the
development
of
the
law
as
you
could.
it
is
a
much
more
sound
approach,
we
think,
to
say
already
had
the
chance
to
build
its
record--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--it
is
still
--
it
has
been
around
for
at
least
20
years.
it
is
still
not
very
common
for
the
very
important
reason
that
trademark
owners
know
that
if
they
hand
these
things
out,
they
are
at
risk
of
having
their
mark
invalidated;
and
second
they
know
that
it
doesn't
avoid
a
--
a
determination
of
the
validity
of
the
mark
because
a
party
like
already
can
always
go
to
the
federal
agency,
the
ttab.
so
i
said
i
have
some
actual
facts,
and
the
facts
are
these:
although
nike
has
a
broad
trademark
portfolio,
it
has
only
once
in
its
history
issued
a
covenant
not
to
sue.
it
is
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
--
justice
kennedy,
we
do
enforce
our
trademarks.
you
say
we
usually
sue.
i
will
tell
you
that
we
have
filed
six
trade
dress
actions
in
the
company's
history.
now,
you
had
said,
because
i
think
it's
the
other
side's
--
the
impression
the
other
side
has
given,
that
we
are
getting
a
special
advantage
over
them.
i
think
it's
really
important
to
recognize
for
purposes
of
standing
doctrine
and
mootness
doctrine
that
of
all
the
shoe
manufacturers
in
the
country,
the
one
that
is
least
likely
to
be
injured
by
this
trademark,
there
is
only
one;
and
it
is
already,
because
they
are
the
only
company
in
the
entire
world
that
has
a
promise
that's
substantial
not
to
be
sued
under
this
trademark.
we
are
the
one
--
they
are
the
ones
that
are
least
likely
to
come
into
conflict
with
nike.
now,
they--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
yes,
that's
right,
but
we
did
give
them
the
covenant,
that's
my
point.
after
the
covenant
--
we
didn't
merely
withdraw
the
case.
i
have
one
other
piece
of
fact.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes,
we're
judicially
estopped.
it's
not
a
contract.
we
are
estopped
and
they
have
--
the
district
court
acted
in
reliance
on
it,
construed
it,
and
so
we
are
bound
by
it.
i
did
have
one
other
fact
for
you,
because
the
other
side
has
given
you
this
impression
that
once
bitten,
twice
shy;
that
if
you
are
sued
once
for
a
trademark
--
they
have
a
special
fear
that
they're
in
the
cross
hairs,
that
we're
watching
everything
that
they
do.
so
when
they
made
this
argument--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
they
are
on
the
top
ten
list
of
infringers.
but
after
that
--
after
that
they
and
they
alone
got
a
covenant
not
to
be
sued,
under
the
--
they
are
the
--
they
are
in
the
specially
protected
position,
not
a
specially
disadvantaged
position.
i
did,
however,
when
they
made
this
argument
in
the
reply
brief
try
to
figure
out
if
that
is
true.
is
it
actually
the
case
that
a
person
who
is
sued
once
has
a
legitimate
worry
that
they
will
actually
be
sued
again,
so
you
should
lower
the
--
the
mootness
or
standing
bar
still
further.
so
we
looked
at
every
single
trademark
action
between
2000
--
january
1,
2000,
and
december
31,
2004,
all
of
them.
there
were
593,
and
over
the
next
eight
years
we
tried
to
figure
out
how
many
times
did
the
plaintiff
sue
the
defendant
again.
it
happened
six
times.
so--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
you
could
not
--
you
could
not
be
more
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it's
also
the
truth
that
--
that
it
is
what
happens
in
every
single
patent
and
trademark
invalidity
case.
if
you
believe
that
gives
rise
to
article
iii
injury,
then
every
party
has
standing
to
challenge
every
competitor.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
i
think
the
reason
they
did
not
pursue
the
rule
41
argument
in
this
court
and
abandoned
it
is
that
it's
completely
understood
if
the
party
that's
instituting
the
claim
says
i'm
not
going
to
pursue
my
case
at
all,
there
simply
is
no
article
iii
jurisdiction.
and
so
even
without
a
rule
41
dismissal,
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
remaining
in
the
case.
the
district
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
might
also
have
said
when
it's
dealt
with
this
issue
on
8(a)
and
9(a)
of
the
petition
appendix,
that
they
actually
acceded
to
the
dismissal
of
our
claims,
they're
happy
to
have
our
claims
gone,
and
you
can't
say
we'll
take
the
dismissal
of
the
--
sorry
--
the
plaintiff's
claim
but
want
to
have
the
counterclaim
remaining.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
no,
i
understand--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--the
chief
justice
suggested
an
argument
that
could
be
made.
it
is
an
argument
that
we
disagree
with.
we've
looked
at
the
cases.
we
think
that
it's
a
point
in
their
favor,
justice
kennedy,
that
while
you
can
go
to
the
ttab,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
appeal
to
an
article
iii
court.
i
think
that's
a
point
in
their
favor.
a
point
in
our
favor,
however,
is
this
notion
of
scarecrow
trademarks
hanging
out
there
on
the
fields
is
inaccurate
because
of
the
ability
to
go
to
the
ttab
in
the
first
instance;
they're
experts.
and
second,
remember
what
i
said
to
justice
sotomayor.
anybody
in
this
market
can
say
we
want
to
counterfeit
the
air
force
1
--
we
just
want
to
make
a
copy
of
it,
it's
not
complicated
--
and
they
will
have
the
right
to
bring
a
claim
to
invalidate
the
mark.
so
we
can't
leave
the
trademark
hanging
out
there.
i
have
kept
trying
to
come
back,
and
if
i
could
in
my
remaining
time,
to
the
understanding
of
the
lower
courts
about
the
record,
because
i
said,
justice
breyer,
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
for
you
to
resolve
the
case
because
they
had
the
opportunity
to
build
a
record,
the
case
came
to
you
on
two
courts'
understanding
of
the
record,
and
so
if
i
could
take
you
back
to
14(a)
and
15(a)
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
not
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
so
on
--
we
do
disagree
because
of
the
court's
decision
in
deakins
that
this
a
voluntary
cessation
case,
but
we
accept
for
present
purposes,
so
you
don't
think
i'm
fighting
the
hypothetical.
assuming
that
voluntary
cessation
principles
apply,
here's
how
they
apply:
when
you
not
just
dismiss
the
case,
but
you
grant
the
covenant
not
to
sue,
and
the
covenant
not
to
sue
says
i
won't
sue
you
over
what
you're
doing
now
or
anything
that
i
can
imagine
you
doing
in
the
future,
because
you
haven't
told
me
anything
else,
then
you
have
ensured
that
the
controversy
can't
arise
again,
and
you've
met
the
voluntary
cessation
doctrine.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
side
comes
forward
with
a
declaration
from
an
officer,
some
other
form
of
proof
that
says,
no,
i'm
worried
i
might
do
something
outside
the
covenant,
i
would
definitely
want
to
make
a
counterfeit,
then
the
case
is
going
to
go
on.
but
this
case
is
not
that
hypothetical
case.
on
14(a),
the
first
full
paragraph,
seven
lines
from
the
bottom,
"given
the
similarity
of
yums'
designs
to
the
'905
mark
and
the
breadth
of
the
covenant,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
scenario
that
would
potentially
infringe
the
'905
mark
and
yet
not
fall
under
the
covenant.
"
"yums
has
not
asserted
any
intention
to
market
any
such
shoe.
"
and
then
in
footnote
5
on
15(a),
"given
the
absence
of
record
evidence
that
yums
intends
to
make
any
arguably
infringing
shoe
that
is
not
unambiguously
covered
by
the
covenant,
this
hypothetical
possibility
does
not
create
a
definite
and
concrete
dispute.
"
that's
how
the
case
should
be
resolved.
you
should
say,
yes,
there
can
be
other
cases
where
the
covenant
is
too
narrow;
yes,
there
can
be
other
cases
where
someone
does
allege
a
desire
to
make
a
counterfeit.
those
are
different
cases.
but
do
not,
i
suggest
to
you,
remand
when
the
facts
have
already
been
developed
in
this
case.
if
we
lose
on
this
record,
we
lose
on
this
record.
but
if
we
win
on
this
record,
we
win
on
it
because
the
record
has
been
built
in
this
case
and
it
is
settled.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
our
burden
was
met
by
our
submission
of
the
covenant
which
dealt
with
every
product
they're
making
and
every
colorable
imitation
in
the
future
of
it.
and
when
they
didn't
then
come
back
and
say,
actually,
we
want
to
make
something
that
might
be
outside
the
covenant,
then
it
was
--
that's
--
that's
when
we
won
the
case.
thank
you
very
much.
