justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
does
that
mean
that
if
they
gave
you
a
covenant
that
said,
vis-a-vis
your
company,
our
trademark,
the
form
of
this
shoe,
is
invalid,
we
won't
sue
you
for
anything,
either
an
exact
duplicate
or
any
colorable
imitation
thereof
with
respect
to
this
design;
would
that
be
enough
for
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know
you
want
to
help
everybody
else--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
why
wouldn't
that
be--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
you're
saying
is
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
i
don't
know
why
--
but
my
solution
was
that
they
would
give
you
a
covenant
that
i
suggested
as
a
possibility
that
would
say,
vis-a-vis
you,
you
can
imitate,
counterfeit,
use
this
design,
only
vis-a-vis
you.
why
doesn't
that
protect
you
fully?
because
what
they're
saying
to
you
is,
copy
the
design
if
you
want,
so
long
as
you're
not
using
another
trademark.
but
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is
whether
you're
infringing
this
design.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
ms.
anders,
what
--
there
is
a
question
about
why
a
competitor
should
have
to
produce
to
its
competition
its
future
plans
of
development.
i
mean,
the
marketplace,
especially
in
fashion,
importantly,
likes
to
keep
quiet
what
it's
doing
because
it
doesn't
want
other
imitators
to
beat
it
to
the
punch.
so
given
that
interest,
why
isn't
their
claim
that
they're
being
inhibited
because
of
the
requirement
to
produce
their
products
or
their
intended
products
enough
to
establish
injury
in
this
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
then
what
did--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
read
this
affidavit
as
saying,
we're
in
the
shoe
industry,
we're
going
to
make
new
shoes
regularly.
we
want
to
copy
their
shoe.
we
don't
think
it's
protected
by
trademark.
we
want
to
copy
it
--
they
don't
say,
and
that's
something
on
rebuttal
that
maybe
petitioner
will
explain,
that
we
want
to
copy
it
exactly.
but
what
they're
saying
is,
we
want
to
copy
it
because
it's
a
free
form.
that's
really
what
i
read
their
affidavit
as
saying.
so
if
--
why
do
they
have
to
actually
--
do
they
have
to
produce
their
design
to
prove
they're
doing
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
saying
it
is
enough?
that's
what
i
thought
their
affidavit
said,
and
i
thought
the
court
below
said,
no,
you've
got
to
show
us
the
product.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
please,
now
go
back
to
my
question.
is
it
enough
to
just
say
it,
or
do
they
have
to
produce
the
designs
so
that
the
court
and
nike
can
decide
--
it
is
nike,
right?
the
court
and
nike
can
decide
whether
the
shoe
is
a
colorable
imitation
or
an
exact
copy.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
agree
with
you.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
you
deal
with
the
point
that's
been
discussed
with
your
adversary,
they
have
to
show
you
everything
they
intend
to
produce?
what
entitles
you
to
that
showing?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
if
they
simply
said--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
have
the
trademark,
we
think
it's
invalid,
we
want
to
copy
your
shoe?
we
want
to
copy
just
the
form
of
your
shoe
because
that's
what
the
trademark
involves.
and
once
we
have
the
invalidity,
that's
what
we're
going
to
do.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
that
be
enough
of
a
showing?
we
don't
have
plans
right
now
because
your
trademark
stopped
us
from
having
the
plans,
but
the
minute
your
trademark
is
--
isn't
validated,
for
sure
we're
going
to
do
it
because
it's
going
to
mean
great
sales
if
we
put
our
name
on
it
rather
than
your
name.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
colorful
imitations
--
colorable
imitations
are
colorable
imitations
of
their
shoe?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
haven't
promised
to
not
sue
them
over
colorable
imitations
of
your
shoe?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
making
this
as
simple
as
i
can.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
a
shoe
manufacturer.
i
want
to
make
new
designs,
and
i
want
to
be
free
to
make
the
designs
that
i
want.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
this
mark
isn't
validated--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
intend
to
copy
as
much
of
it
as
i
can.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
have
any
records
of
doing
the
planning
because
the
trademark
was
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
for
sure,
given
my
current
shoe--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
the
fact
that
they
thought
i
imitated
them--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--meaning
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
invalidate
the
mark,
i'm
going
to
copy
as
much
of
it
as
i
can.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
that
be
enough?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
your
mind
you're
saying--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
could
do
discovery
then?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
the
discovery
is
going
to
show
what?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
president
comes
in
and
says
exactly
what
i
said.
there
are
no
plans--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--yes.
you
don't
have
to
read
to
us.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
what
they
were
arguing--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you
are
saying
that
you've
met
--
if
we
decide
you
bear
the
burden
of
proof,
you're
saying,
you
--
you
could
live
with
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
your
burden
was
met
by
their
submissions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
his
challenge,
you
said
to
have
a
chance
in
three
different
courts
to
say
directly
and
unequivocally
if
the
mark
is
invalid,
we're
going
to
imitate,
and
you
haven't
been
willing
to
do
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
your
commercial
interest?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
you
willing
to
make
the
statement
he's
asked
you
for?
you
keep
equivocating
on
the
answer.
you
know,
it's
like
i
don't
want
to
say
it,
is
what
you're
telling
us.
