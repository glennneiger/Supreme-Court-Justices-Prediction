justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
reason
for
the
formula
--
of
course,
part
of
the
formula
looks
back
to
what
happened
in
1965.
and
it
says
are
you
a
jurisdiction
that
did
engage
in
testing
and
had
low
turnout
or
--
or
low
registration?
now,
that
isn't
true
of
alabama
today.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
when
congress
in
fact
reenacted
this
in
2005,
it
knew
what
it
was
doing
was
picking
out
alabama.
it
understood
it
was
picking
out
alabama,
even
though
the
indicia
are
not
--
i
mean,
even
though
they're
not
engaging
in
that
particular
thing.
but
the
underlying
evil
is
the
discrimination.
so
the
closest
analogy
i
could
think
of
is
imagine
a
state
has
a
plant
disease
and
in
1965
you
can
recognize
the
presence
of
that
disease,
which
is
hard
to
find,
by
a
certain
kind
of
surface
movement
or
plant
growing
up.
now,
it's
evolved.
so
by
now,
when
we
use
that
same
formula,
all
we're
doing
is
picking
out
that
state.
but
we
know
one
thing:
the
disease
is
still
there
in
the
state.
because
this
is
a
question
of
renewing
a
statute
that
in
fact
has
worked.
and
so
the
question
i
guess
is,
is
it
rational
to
pick
out
at
least
some
of
those
states?
and
to
go
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
as
long
as
it's
rational
in
at
least
some
instances
directly
to
pick
out
those
states,
at
least
one
or
two
of
them,
then
doesn't
the
statute
survive
a
facial
challenge?
that's
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
this
is
then
the
question,
does
it
justify?
i
mean,
this
isn't
a
question
of
rewriting
the
statute.
this
is
a
question
of
renewing
a
statute
that
by
and
large
has
worked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
you
have
a
statute
that
sunsets,
you
might
say:
i
don't
want
it
to
sunset
if
it's
worked,
as
long
as
the
problem
is
still
there
to
some
degree.
that's
the
question
of
rationality.
isn't
that
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
they're
thinking
exactly,
but
it
seems
to
me
one
might
reasonably
think
this:
it's
an
old
disease,
it's
gotten
a
lot
better,
a
lot
better,
but
it's
still
there.
so
if
you
had
a
remedy
that
really
helped
it
work,
but
it
wasn't
totally
over,
wouldn't
you
keep
that
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
would
you
not
at
least
say
that
a
person
who
wants
to
keep
that
remedy,
which
has
worked
for
that
old
disease
which
is
not
yet
dead,
let's
keep
it
going.
is
that
an
irrational
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
sorry.
the
old
disease
is
discrimination
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
which
is
abridging
a
person's
right
to
vote
because
of
color
or
race.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
what's
the
answer?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i
hear
your
answer
to
an
allegation,
argument,
an
excellent
argument,
that's
been
made,
or
at
least
as
i've
picked
up,
and
that
is
that:
yes,
the
problem
was
terrible;
it
has
gotten
a
lot
better;
it
is
not
to
some
degree
cured.
all
right?
i
think
there
is
a
kind
of
common
ground.
now
then
the
question
is:
well,
what
about
this
statute
that
has
a
certain
formula?
one
response
is:
yes,
it
has
a
formula
that
no
longer
has
tremendous
relevance
in
terms
of
its
characteristic
--
that
is
literacy
tests.
but
it
still
picked
out
nine
states.
so,
so
far,
you're
with
me.
so
it
was
rational
when
you
continue.
you
know,
you
don't
sunset
it.
you
just
keep
it
going.
you're
not
held
to
quite
the
same
criteria
as
if
you
were
writing
it
in
the
first
place.
but
it
does
treat
states
all
the
same
that
are
somewhat
different.
one
response
to
that
is:
well,
this
is
the
fifteenth
amendment,
a
special
amendment,
you
know?
maybe
you're
right.
then
let's
proceed
state
by
state.
let's
look
at
it
state
by
state.
that's
what
we
normally
do,
not
as
applied.
all
right.
now,
i
don't
know
how
satisfactory
that
answer
is.
i
want
to
know
what
your
response
is
as
to
whether
we
should
--
if
he's
right
--
if
he's
right
that
there
is
an
irrationality
involved
if
you
were
writing
it
today
in
treating
state
a,
which
is
not
too
discriminatorily
worse
than
apparently
massachusetts
or
something.
so
--
so
if
that's
true,
do
we
respond
state
by
state?
or
is
this
a
matter
we
should
consider
not
as
applied,
but
on
its
face?
i
just
want
to
hear
what
you
think
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
his
point,
i
think
the
point
is
this:
if
you
draw
a
red
line
around
the
states
that
are
in,
at
least
some
of
those
states
have
a
better
record
than
some
of
the
states
that
are
out.
so
in
1965,
well,
we
have
history.
we
have
200
years
or
perhaps
of
slavery.
we
have
80
years
or
so
of
legal
segregation.
we
have
had
41
years
of
this
statute.
and
this
statute
has
helped,
a
lot.
so
therefore
congress
in
2005
looks
back
and
says
don't
change
horses
in
the
middle
of
the
stream,
because
we
still
have
a
ways
to
go.
now
the
question
is,
is
it
rational
to
do
that?
and
people
could
differ
on
that.
and
one
thing
to
say
is,
of
course
this
is
aimed
at
states.
what
do
you
think
the
civil
war
was
about?
of
course
it
was
aimed
at
treating
some
states
differently
than
others.
and
at
some
point
that
historical
and
practical
sunset/no
sunset,
renew
what
worked
type
of
justification
runs
out.
and
the
question,
i
think,
is
has
it
run
out
now?
and
now
you
tell
me
when
does
it
run
out?
what
is
the
standard
for
when
it
runs
out?
never?
that's
something
you
have
heard
people
worried
about.
does
it
never
run
out?
or
does
it
run
out,
but
not
yet?
or
do
we
have
a
clear
case
where
at
least
it
doesn't
run
out
now?
now,
i
would
like
you
to
address
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
don't
change
horses.
you
renew
what
is
in
the
past--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
it
works,
as
long
as
the
problem
isn't
solved.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
this
difference,
which
i
think
is
a
key
difference.
you
refer
to
the
problem
as
the
problem
identified
by
the
tool
for
picking
out
the
states,
which
was
literacy
tests,
et
cetera.
but
i
suspect
the
problem
was
the
denial
or
abridgement
by
a
state
of
the
right
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
race
and
color.
and
that
test
was
a
way
of
picking
out
places
where
that
problem
existed.
now,
if
my
version
of
the
problem
is
the
problem,
it
certainly
is
not
solved.
if
your
version
of
the
problem,
literacy
tests,
is
the
problem,
well,
you
have
a
much
stronger
case.
so
how,
in
your
opinion,
do
we
decide
what
was
the
problem
that
congress
was
addressing
in
the
voting
rights
act?
