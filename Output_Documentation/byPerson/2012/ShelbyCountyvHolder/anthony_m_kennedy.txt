justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
the
thrust
of
the
questions
so
far
has
been
if
you
would
be
covered
under
any
formula
that
most
likely
would
be
drawn,
why
are
you
injured
under
this
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
--
that's
the
hypothesis.
if
you
could
be
covered
under
most
suggested
formulas
for
this
kind
of
statute,
why
are
you
injured
by
this
one?
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
some
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--some
of
the
questions
asked
to
this
point
i
think
mirror
what
the
government
says
toward
the
end
of
its
brief,
page
48
and
page
49.
it's
rather
proud
of
this
reverse
engineering:
we
really
knew
it
was
some
specific
states
we
were
interested
in,
and
so
we
used
these
old
categories
to
cover
that
state.
is
that
a
methodology
that
in
your
view
is
appropriate
under
the
test
of
congruence
and
--
and
proportionality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
--
suppose
there
were
and
suppose
that's
the
rationale,
because
that's
what
i
got
from
the
government's
brief
and
what
i'm
getting
--
getting
from
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench.
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
--
and
i
don't
know
why
--
why
you
even
go
that
far.
i
don't
know
why
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
it
would
be
proper
to
just
single
out
states
by
name,
and
if
that
in
effect
is
what
is
being
done,
that
seemed
to
me
equally
improper.
but
you
don't
seem
to
make
that
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
like
to
hear
the
answer
to
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
time
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--about
ready
to
expire
for
the
rebuttal
period.
but
i
do
have
this
question:
can
you
tell
me
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
can
very
easily
bring
a
section
2
suit
and
as
part
of
that
ask
for
bail-in
under
section
3.
are
those
expensive,
time-consuming
suits?
do
we
have
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
or
anything
in
the
bar's
experience
that
you
could
advise
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
an
effective
remedy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
reverse
engineering
that
you
seem
so
proud
of,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
obscures
the
--
the
real
purpose
of
--
of
the
statute.
and
if
congress
is
going
to
single
out
separate
states
by
name,
it
should
do
it
by
name.
if
not,
it
should
use
criteria
that
are
relevant
to
the
existing
--
and
congress
just
didn't
have
the
time
or
the
energy
to
do
this;
it
just
reenacted
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
marshall
plan
was
very
good,
too,
the
morale
act,
the
northwest
ordinance,
but
times
change.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
do
think
the
evidence
is
very
clear
that
section
--
that
individual
suits
under
section
2
type
litigation
were
just
insufficient
and
that
section
5
was
utterly
necessary
in
1965.
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
with
--
with
a
modern
understanding
of
--
of
the
dangers
of
polling
place
changes,
with
prospective
injunctions,
with
preliminary
injunctions,
it's
not
clear
--
and
--
and
with
the
fact
that
the
government
itself
can
commence
these
suits,
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
there's
that
much
difference
in
a
section
2
suit
now
and
preclearance.
i
may
be
wrong
about
that.
i
don't
have
statistics
for
it.
that's
why
we're
asking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
tell
us
how
many
attorneys
and
how
many
staff
in
the
justice
department
are
involved
in
the
preclearance
process?
is
it
5
or
15?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
preclearance
device
could
be
enacted
for
the
entire
united
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
because
that
there
is
a
federalism
interest
in
each
state
being
responsible
to
ensure
that
it
has
a
political
system
that
acts
in
a
democratic
and
a
civil
and
a
decent
and
a
proper
and
a
constitutional
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
--
if
alabama
wants
to
have
monuments
to
the
heros
of
the
civil
rights
movement,
if
it
wants
to
acknowledge
the
wrongs
of
its
past,
is
it
better
off
doing
that
if
it's
an
own
independent
sovereign
or
if
it's
under
the
trusteeship
of
the
united
states
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
a
section
2
case
can,
in
effect,
have
an
order
for
bail-in,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
under
section
3
and
then
you
basically
have
a
mini
--
something
that
replicates
section
5.
