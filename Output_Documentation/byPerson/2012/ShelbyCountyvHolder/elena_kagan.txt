but
think
about
this
state
that
you're
representing,
it's
about
a
quarter
black,
but
alabama
has
no
black
statewide
elected
officials.
if
congress
were
to
write
a
formula
that
looked
to
the
number
of
successful
section
2
suits
per
million
residents,
alabama
would
be
the
number
one
state
on
the
list.
if
you
factor
in
unpublished
section
2
suits,
alabama
would
be
the
number
two
state
on
the
list.
if
you
use
the
number
of
section
5
enforcement
actions,
alabama
would
again
be
the
number
two
state
on
the
list.
i
mean,
you're
objecting
to
a
formula,
but
under
any
formula
that
congress
could
devise,
it
would
capture
alabama.
justice
elena
kagan
and
in
1986
--
or
excuse
me,
2006
--
congress
went
back
to
the
problem,
developed
a
very
substantial
record,
a
15,000-page
legislative
record,
talked
about
what
problems
had
been
solved,
talked
about
what
problems
had
yet
to
be
solved,
and
decided
that,
although
the
problem
had
changed,
the
problem
was
still
evident
enough
that
the
act
should
continue.
it's
hard
to
see
how
congress
could
have
developed
a
better
and
more
thorough
legislative
record
than
it
did,
mr.
rein.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
sounds
like
a
good
argument
to
me,
justice
scalia.
it
was
clear
to
98
senators,
including
every
senator
from
a
covered
state,
who
decided
that
there
was
a
continuing
need
for
this
piece
of
legislation.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
the
fifteenth
amendment
says
“
denial
or
abridgement
”.
what
would
“
abridgement
”
mean
except
for
dilution?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
the
formula
that
has--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
mr.
rein,
the
formula
that
--
that
is
applied
right
now,
under
that
formula
covered
jurisdictions,
which
have
less
than
25
percent
of
the
nation's
total
population,
they
account
for
56
percent
of
all
successful
published
section
2
lawsuits.
if
you
do
that
on
a
per
capita
basis,
the
successful
section
2
lawsuits,
four
times
higher
in
covered
jurisdictions
than
in
noncovered
jurisdictions.
so
the
formula
--
you
can,
you
know,
say
maybe
this
district
shouldn't
be
covered,
maybe
this
one
should
be
covered.
the
formula
seems
to
be
working
pretty
well
in
terms
of
going
after
the
actual
violations
on
the
ground
and
who's
committing
them.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
all
formulas
are
underinclusive
and
all
formulas
are
overinclusive.
congress
has
developed
this
formula
and
has
continued
it
in
use
that
actually
seems
to
work
pretty
well
in
targeting
the
places
where
there
are
the
most
successful
section
2
lawsuits,
where
there
are
the
most
violations
on
the
ground
that
have
been
adjudicated.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
rein--
justice
elena
kagan
--that
is
the
question,
isn't
it?
you
said
the
problem
has
been
solved.
but
who
gets
to
make
that
judgment
really?
is
it
you,
is
it
the
court,
or
is
it
congress?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
a
big,
new
power
that
you
are
giving
us,
that
we
have
the
power
now
to
decide
whether
racial
discrimination
has
been
solved?
i
did
not
think
that
that
fell
within
our
bailiwick.
