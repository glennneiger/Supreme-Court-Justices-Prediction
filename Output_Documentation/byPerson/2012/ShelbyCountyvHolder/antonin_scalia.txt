justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
about
to
ask
a
similar
question.
if
someone
is
acquitted
of
a
federal
crime,
would
it
--
would
the
prosecution
be
able
to
say,
well,
okay,
he
didn't
commit
this
crime,
but
congress
could
have
enacted
a
different
statute
which
he
would
have
violated
in
this
case.
of
course,
you
wouldn't
listen
to
that,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
congress
must
have
found
that
the
situation
was
even
clearer
and
the
violations
even
more
evident
than
originally,
because
originally,
the
vote
in
the
senate,
for
example,
was
something
like
79
to
18,
and
in
the
2006
extension,
it
was
98
to
nothing.
it
must
have
been
even
clearer
in
2006
that
these
states
were
violating
the
constitution.
do
you
think
that's
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
decided
that
perhaps
they'd
better
not
vote
against
it,
that
there's
nothing,
that
there's
no
--
none
of
their
interests
in
voting
against
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
same
thing.
i
thought
it's
sort
of
extraordinary
to
say
congress
can
just
pick
out,
we
want
to
hit
these
eight
states,
it
doesn't
matter
what
formula
we
use;
so
long
as
we
want
to
hit
these
eight
states,
that's
good
enough
and
that
makes
it
constitutional.
i
doubt
that
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
happens
not
to
be
the
method
that
congress
selected.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
selected
that,
you
could
say
they
used
a
rationale
that
works.
but
just
because
they
picked
some
other
rationale
which
happens
to
produce
this
result
doesn't
seem
to
me
very
persuasive.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
will
always
be
true
forever
into
the
future.
you
could
always
say,
oh,
there
has
been
improvement,
but
the
only
reason
there
has
been
improvement
are
these
extraordinary
procedures
that
deny
the
states
sovereign
powers
which
the
constitution
preserves
to
them.
so,
since
the
only
reason
it's
improved
is
because
of
these
procedures,
we
must
continue
those
procedures
in
perpetuity.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
argument
you
are
making?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
the
argument
you
were
just
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
different
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
hundreds?
dozens?
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
it
was
making
that
judgment,
mr.
verrilli.
but
that's
--
that's
a
problem
that
i
have.
this
court
doesn't
like
to
get
involved
in
--
in
racial
questions
such
as
this
one.
it's
something
that
can
be
left
--
left
to
congress.
the
problem
here,
however,
is
suggested
by
the
comment
i
made
earlier,
that
the
initial
enactment
of
this
legislation
in
a
--
in
a
time
when
the
need
for
it
was
so
much
more
abundantly
clear
was
--
in
the
senate,
there
--
it
was
double-digits
against
it.
and
that
was
only
a
5-year
term.
then,
it
is
reenacted
5
years
later,
again
for
a
5-year
term.
double-digits
against
it
in
the
senate.
then
it
was
reenacted
for
7
years.
single
digits
against
it.
then
enacted
for
25
years,
8
senate
votes
against
it.
and
this
last
enactment,
not
a
single
vote
in
the
senate
against
it.
and
the
house
is
pretty
much
the
same.
now,
i
don't
think
that's
attributable
to
the
fact
that
it
is
so
much
clearer
now
that
we
need
this.
i
think
it
is
attributable,
very
likely
attributable,
to
a
phenomenon
that
is
called
perpetuation
of
racial
entitlement.
it's
been
written
about.
whenever
a
society
adopts
racial
entitlements,
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
out
of
them
through
the
normal
political
processes.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
to
be
gained
by
any
senator
to
vote
against
continuation
of
this
act.
and
i
am
fairly
confident
it
will
be
reenacted
in
perpetuity
unless
--
unless
a
court
can
say
it
does
not
comport
with
the
constitution.
you
have
to
show,
when
you
are
treating
different
states
differently,
that
there's
a
good
reason
for
it.
that's
the
--
that's
the
concern
that
those
of
us
who
--
who
have
some
questions
about
this
statute
have.
it's
--
it's
a
concern
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
question
you
can
leave
to
congress.
there
are
certain
districts
in
the
house
that
are
black
districts
by
law
just
about
now.
and
even
the
virginia
senators,
they
have
no
interest
in
voting
against
this.
the
state
government
is
not
their
government,
and
they
are
going
to
lose
--
they
are
going
to
lose
votes
if
they
do
not
reenact
the
voting
rights
act.
even
the
name
of
it
is
wonderful:
the
voting
rights
act.
who
is
going
to
vote
against
that
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
looked
behind
it
in
boerne.
i'm
not
talking
about
dismissing
it.
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
looking
at
it
to
see
whether
it
makes
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
true
in
every
state,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
i
don't
think
anybody
is
contesting
that
it's
more
effective
if
you
use
section
5.
the
issue
is
why
just
in
these
states.
that's
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
the
noncovered
states
are
worse
in
that
regard
than
the
nine
covered
states;
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
every
--
every
one
of
them
is
worse.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
a
fair
one,
it's
the
crucial
question.
congress
has
selected
these
nine
states.
now,
is
there
some
good
reason
for
selecting
these
nine?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
good
answer.
i
was
hoping
you
would
say
that.
