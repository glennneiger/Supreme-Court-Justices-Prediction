justice
sonia
sotomayor
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
assuming
i
accept
your
premise,
and
there's
some
question
about
that,
that
some
portions
of
the
south
have
changed,
your
county
pretty
much
hasn't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
--
in
the
period
we're
talking
about,
it
has
many
more
discriminating
--
240
discriminatory
voting
laws
that
were
blocked
by
section
5
objections.
there
were
numerous
remedied
by
section
2
litigation.
you
may
be
the
wrong
party
bringing
this.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
the
standard.
and
why
would
we
vote
in
favor
of
a
county
whose
record
is
the
epitome
of
what
caused
the
passage
of
this
law
to
start
with?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
facial
challenges
are
generally
disfavored
in
our
law.
and
so
the
question
becomes,
why
do
we
strike
down
a
formula,
as
justice
kagan
said,
which
under
any
circumstance
the
record
shows
the
remedy
would
be
congruent,
proportional,
rational,
whatever
standard
of
review
we
apply,
its
application
to
alabama
would
happen.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
interestingly
enough,
in
katzenbach
the
court
didn't
do
what
you're
asking
us
to
do,
which
is
to
look
at
the
record
of
all
the
other
states
or
all
of
the
other
counties.
it
basically
concentrated
on
the
record
of
the
two
litigants
in
the
case,
and
from
that
extrapolate
--
extrapolated
more
broadly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you're
asking
us
to
do
something,
which
is
to
ignore
your
record
and
look
at
everybody
else's.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
with
those
hypotheticals
is
obvious
that
it
starts
from
a
predicate
that
the
application
has
no
basis
in
any
record,
but
there's
no
question
that
alabama
was
rightly
included
in
the
original
voting
rights
act.
there's
no
challenge
to
the
reauthorization
acts.
the
only
question
is
whether
a
formula
should
be
applied
today.
and
the
point
is
that
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
to
show
that
you
should.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
not
like
there's
some
made-up
reason
for
why
the
$1,000
is
being
applied
to
you
or
why
a
different
crime
is
going
to
be
charged
against
you.
it's
a
real
record
as
to
what
alabama
has
done
to
earn
its
place
on
the
list.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
the
reason
section
5
was
created
was
because
states
were
moving
faster
than
litigation
permitted
to
catch
the
new
forms
of
discriminatory
practices
that
were
being
developed.
as
the
courts
struck
down
one
form,
the
states
would
find
another.
and
basically,
justice
ginsburg
calls
it
secondary.
i
don't
know
that
i'd
call
anything
secondary
or
primary.
discrimination
is
discrimination.
and
what
congress
said
is
it
continues,
not
in
terms
of
voter
numbers,
but
in
terms
of
examples
of
other
ways
to
disenfranchise
voters,
like
moving
a
voting
booth
from
a
convenient
location
for
all
voters
to
a
place
that
historically
has
been
known
for
discrimination.
i
think
that's
an
example
taken
from
one
of
the
section
2
and
5
cases
from
alabama.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
the
difference
is
except
that
this
court
or
some
may
think
that
secondary
is
not
important.
but
the
form
of
discrimination
is
still
discrimination
if
congress
has
found
it
to
be
so.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--what
it
did
with
section
5.
it
said
we
can't
keep
up
with
the
way
states
are
doing
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
was
on
voter
dilution
as
well.
it
had
already
evolved
away
from
that,
or
started
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
are
you--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--why?
why
does
congress
have
to
fix
any
problem
immediately?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
going
to
have
a
hard
time
with
that
because
you
can't
be
suggesting
that
the
government
sees
a
problem
in
one
or
more
states
and
decides
it's
going
to
do
something
for
them
and
not
for
others,
like
emergency
relief,
and
that
that
somehow
violates
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
you
can't
treat
states
the
same
because
their
problems
are
different,
their
populations
are
different,
their
needs
are
different.
everything
is
different
about
the
states.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
tell
me
what
you
think
is
left
of
the
rational
means
test
in
katzenbach
and
city
of
rome?
do
you
think
the
city
of
boerne
now
controls
both
fourteen
--
the
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
how
we
look
at
any
case
that
arises
under
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
in
the
reauthorization--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
that
the
right
to
vote
is
a
racial
entitlement
in
section
5?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
asked
a
different
question.
do
you
think
section
5
was
voted
for
because
it
was
a
racial
entitlement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
there
was
no
basis
to
find
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--do
you
think
that
racial
discrimination
in
voting
has
ended,
that
there
is
none
anywhere?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
shouldn't--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--you've
given
me
some
statistics
that
alabama
hasn't,
but
there
are
others
that
are
very
compelling
that
it
has.
why
should
we
make
the
judgment,
and
not
congress,
about
the
types
and
forms
of
discrimination
and
the
need
to
remedy
them?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
other
states
have
240
successful
section
2
and
section
5--
