mr.
bert
w.
rein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
almost
4
years
ago,
eight
justices
of
the
court
agreed
the
2005
25-year
extension
of
voting
rights
act
section
5's
preclearance
obligation,
uniquely
applicable
to
jurisdictions
reached
by
section
4(b)'s
antiquated
coverage
formula,
raised
a
serious
constitutional
question.
those
justices
recognized
that
the
record
before
the
congress
in
2005
made
it
unmistakable
that
the
south
had
changed.
they
questioned
whether
current
remedial
needs
justified
the
extraordinary
federalism
and
cost
burdens
of
preclearance.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
i--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
this
is
an
on-face
challenge,
and
might
i
say,
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
i
don't
agree
with
your
premises,
but
let
me
just
say,
number
one,
when
i
said
the
south
has
changed,
that
is
the
statement
that
is
made
by
the
eight
justices
in
the
northwest
austin
case.
and
i
certainly--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
ginsburg,
judge
williams
said
that,
as
he
assessed
various
measures
in
the
record,
he
thought
those
states
might
be
distinguished.
he
did
not
say,
and
he
didn't
reach
the
question,
whether
those
states
should
be
subject
to
preclearance.
in
other
words,
whether
on
an
absolute
basis,
there
was
sufficient
record
to
subject
them--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
if
--
if
i
might
respond,
because
i
think
justice
sotomayor
had
a
similar
question,
and
that
is
why
should
this
be
approached
on
face.
going
back
to
katzenbach,
and
all
of
the
cases
that
have
addressed
the
voting
rights
act
preclearance
and
the
formula,
they've
all
been
addressed
to
determine
the
validity
of
imposing
preclearance
under
the
circumstances
then
prevailing,
and
the
formula,
because
shelby
county
is
covered,
not
by
an
independent
determination
of
congress
with
respect
to
shelby
county,
but
because
it
falls
within
the
formula
as
part
of
the
state
of
alabama.
so
i
--
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
reluctance
upon
on
this--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--there
--
there
are
two
separate
questions.
one
is
whether
the
formula
needs
to
be
addressed.
in
northwest
austin,
this
court
addressed
the
formula,
and
the
circumstances
there
were
a
very
small
jurisdiction,
as
the
court
said,
approaching
a
very
big
question.
it
did
the
same
in
rome,
the
city
of
rome.
it
did
the
same
in
katzenbach.
the
--
so
the
formula
itself
is
the
reason
why
shelby
county
encounters
the
burdens,
and
it
is
the
reason
why
the
court
needs
to
address
it.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
katzenbach.
in
katzenbach,
what
the
court
did
was
examined
whether
the
--
the
formula
was
rational
in
practice
and
theory.
and
what
the
court
said
is,
while
we
don't
have
evidence
on
every
jurisdiction
that's
reached
by
the
formula,
that
by
devising
two
criteria
which
were
predictive
of
where
discrimination
might
lie,
the
congress
could
then
sweep
in
jurisdictions
as
to
which
it
had
no
specific
findings.
so
we're
not
here
to
parse
the
jurisdictions.
we
are
here
to
challenge
this
formula
because
in
and
of
itself
it
speaks
to
old
data,
it
isn't
probative
with
respect
to
the
kinds
of
discrimination
that
congress
was
focusing
on
and
it
is
an
inappropriate
vehicle
to
sort
out
the
sovereignty
of
individual
states.
i
could
tell
you
that
in
alabama
the
number
of
legislators
in
the
alabama
legislature
are
proportionate
to
the
number
of
black
voters.
there's
a
very
high
registration
and
turnout
of
black
voters
in
alabama.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
really
addresses
the
issue
of
the
rationality
in
theory
and
practice
in
the
formula.
if
congress
wants
to
write
another
statute,
another
hypothetical
statute,
that
would
present
a
different
case.
but
we're
here
facing
a
county,
a
state
that
are
swept
in
by
a
formula
that
is
neither
rational
in
theory
nor
in
practice.
that's
the
--
that's
the
hub
of
the
case.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
we
don't
agree
that
we
would
be
covered
under
any
formula.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
i
think
that
if
--
if
congress
has
the
power
to
look
at
jurisdictions
like
shelby
county
individually
and
without
regard
to
how
they
stand
against
other
states
--
other
counties,
other
states,
in
other
words,
what
is
the
discrimination
here
among
the
jurisdictions,
and
after
thoroughly
considering
each
and
every
one
comes
up
with
a
list
and
says
this
list
greatly
troubles
us,
that
might
present
a
vehicle
for
saying
this
is
a
way
to
sort
out
the
covered
jurisdictions--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--no,
because
that
would
just
invent
another
statute,
and
this
is
all
a
debate
as
to
whether
somebody
might
invent
a
statute
which
has
a
formula
that
is
rational.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
i
mean--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
sotomayor,
with
all
respect,
the
question
whether
alabama
was
properly
placed
under
the
act
in
1964
was
--
it
was
answered
in
katzenbach,
because
it
came
under
a
formula
then
deemed
to
be
rational
in
theory
and
in
practice.
there's
no
independent
determination
by
the
congress
that
alabama
singly
should
be
covered.
congress
has
up
--
you
know,
has
readopted
the
formula
and
it
is
the
formula
that
covers
alabama
and
thus
shelby
county--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
thank
you.
justice
breyer,
a
couple
of
things
are
important.
the
court
said
in
northwest
austin,
an
opinion
you
joined,
"current
needs
have
to
generate
the
current
burden.
"
so
what
happened
in
1965
in
alabama,
that
alabama
itself
has
said
was
a
disgrace,
doesn't
justify
a
current
burden.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
justice
breyer--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--if
you
base
it
on
the
findings
of
1965.
i
could
take
the
decision
in
city
of
rome,
which
follows
along
that
line.
we
had
a
huge
problem
at
the
first
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
court
was
tolerant
of
congress's
decision
that
it
had
not
yet
been
cured.
there
were
vestiges
of
discrimination.
so
when
i
look
at
those
statistics
today
and
look
at
what
alabama
has
in
terms
of
black
registration
and
turnout,
there's
no
resemblance.
we're
dealing
with
a
completely
changed
situation--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--to
which
if
you
apply
those
metrics
--
excuse
me.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
let
me
speak
to
that,
because
i
think
that
that
highlights
one
of
the
weaknesses
here.
on
the
one
hand,
justice
breyer's
questioning,
well,
could
congress
just
continue
based
on
what
it
found
in
'65
and
renew?
and
i
think
your
question
shows
it's
a
very
different
situation.
congress
is
not
continuing
its
efforts
initiated
in
1975
to
allow
people--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
sotomayor--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--when
congress
is
addressing
a
new
evil,
it
needs
then
--
and
assuming
it
can
find
this
evil
to
a
level
justifying--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--the
extraordinary
remedy--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--i
think
we're
dealing
with
two
different
questions.
one
is
was
that
kind
of
remedy,
an
unusual
remedy,
never
before
and
never
after
invoked
by
the
congress,
putting
states
into
a
prior
restraint
in
the
exercise
of
their
core
sovereign
functions,
was
that
justified?
and
in
katzenbach,
the
court
said
we're
confronting
an
emergency
in
the
country,
we're
confronting
people
who
will
not,
who
will
not
honor
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
who
will
use--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
i'm
not
questioning
whether
congress
did
its
best.
the
question
is
whether
what
congress
found
was
adequate
to
invoke
this
unusual
remedy.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no.
i
think
the
court
has
to--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--that
is
a
hypothetical
that
doesn't
address
what
happened,
because
what
happened
is
the
old
disease,
limiting
people's
right
to
register
and
vote,
to
have--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--but
the
focus
of
the
congress
in
1965
and
in
katzenbach
in
1964
and
in
katzenbach
was
on
registration
and
voting,
precluding--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--i
beg
your
pardon,
but
i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
that
this
court
has
never
decided
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
governs
vote
dilution.
it
has
said
the
fourteenth
amendment
does,
but
the
original
enactment
was
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
“
abridgement
”
might
mean,
for
example,
i
let
you
vote
in
one
election
but
not
in
another;
for
example,
separate
primary
rules
from
election
rules.
abridgement
can
be
done
in
many
ways.
i
think
dilution
is
a
different
concept.
we're
not
saying
that
dilution
isn't
covered
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
was
responding
to
justice
breyer
in
saying
there
was
an
old
disease
and
that
disease
is
cured.
if
you
want
to
label
it
“
disease
”
and
generalize
it,
you
can
say,
well,
the
new
disease
is
still
a
disease.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
but
i
think
that's
not
what
happened.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no,
i
think
it
is
not.
first
of
all,
i
don't
accept
that
it
was,
quote,
“
reverse
engineered
”.
i
think
it
was
just,
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
continued
because
it
was
there.
if
you
look
at
what
was
done
and
was
approved
in
1964,
what
congress
said,
well,
here
are
the
problem
areas
that
we
detect.
we've
examined
them
in
detail.
we've
identified
the
characteristics
that
would
let
somebody
say,
yes,
that's
where
the
discrimination
is
ripe.
they're
using
a
tester
device.
the
turnout
is
below
the
national
average
by
a
substantial
margin.
that
spells
it
out
and
we
have
a
relief
valve
in
the
then-existing
bailout.
so
it
was
all
very
rational.
here
you'd
have
to
say
is
the
finding
with
respect
to
every
state
--
alaska,
arizona,
the
covered
jurisdictions
in
new
york
city
--
is
the
designation
of
them
congruent
to
the
problem
that
you
detect
in
each
one?
even
assuming
--
and
we
don't
accept
--
that
any
of
these
problems
require
the
kind
of
extraordinary
relief,
what's
the
congruence
and
what's
the
proportionality
of
this
remedy
to
the
violation
you
detect
state
by
state.
so
merely
saying
it's
reverse
engineered,
first
of
all
it
says,
well,
congress
really
thought
about
it
and
said,
we
made
up
a
list
in
our
heads
and,
gee
whiz,
this
old
formula
miraculously
covered
the
list.
there's
no
record
that
that
happened.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
if
--
if
there
was
a
record
sufficient
for
each
of
those
states
to
sacrifice
their
--
their
inherent
core
power
to
preclearance,
to
prior
restraint,
i
think
that
you
certainly
could
argue
that,
well,
how
congress
described
them,
as
long
as
it's
rational,
might
work.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
have
that
record
here,
so--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
scalia,
i
agree
with
that.
what
i
was
saying
here
is
that
congress
did--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--okay.
the
answer,
justice
kennedy,
is
congress
cannot
arbitrarily
pick
out
states.
congress
has
to
treat
each
state
with
equal
dignity.
it
has
to
examine
all
the
states.
the
teaching
of
katzenbach
is
that
when
congress
has
done
that
kind
of
examination,
it
can
devise
a
formula
even
if
it
understands
that
that
formula
will
not
apply
across
all
50
states.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
so
we
accept
katzenbach.
but
in
terms
of
just
picking
out
states
and
saying,
i'm
going
to
look
at
you
and
i'm
going
to
look
at
you,
no,
that
--
that
does
not
protect
the
equal
dignity
of
the
states.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
there
are
--
there
are
two
fallacies,
justice
kagan,
in
--
in
that
statement.
number
one
is
treating
the
covered
jurisdictions
as
some
kind
of
entity,
a
lump:
let
us
treat
them.
and
as
judge
williams
did
in
his
dissent,
if
you
look
at
them
one
by
one,
giving
them
their
equal
dignity,
you
won't
reach
the
same
result.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
if
--
if
you
look
at
the
analysis
state
by
state
done
by
judge
williams,
that
isn't
true.
congress
has
picked
out
some
states
that
fall
at
the
top
and
some
that
do
not,
and
there
are
other
states
like
illinois
or
tennessee,
and
i
don't
think
they
deserve
preclearance,
that
clearly
have
comparable
records.
and
second,
dividing
by
population
may
make
it
look
it
look
better,
but
it
is
irrational.
it
is
not
only
irrational
when
we
object
to
it,
but
note
that
in
the
brief
of
the
harris
respondent
they
say
it's
irrational
because,
after
all,
that
makes
delaware,
a
small
state,
look
worse
on
a
list
of
who
are
the
primary
violators.
it's
not
a
useful
metric.
it
may
make
a
nice
number.
but
there
is
no
justification
for
that
measure.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
correct.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
thank
you.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--it
is
--
number
one,
it
is
effective.
there
are
preliminary
injunctions.
it
depends
on
the
kind
of
dispute
you
have.
some
of
them
are
very
complex,
and
it
would
be
complex
if
somebody
brought
--
a
state
brought
a
section
5
challenge
in
a
three-judge
court
saying
the
attorney
general's
denied
me
preclearance.
so
it's
the
complexity
of
the
question,
not
the
nature
of
section
2.
and
might
i
say,
if
you
look
at
the
voting
rights
act,
one
thing
that
really
stands
out
is
you
are
up
against
states
with
entrenched
discriminatory
practices
in
their
law.
the
remedy
congress
put
in
place
for
those
states
was
section
2.
and
all
across
the
country,
when
you
talk
about
equal
sovereignty,
if
there
is
a
problem
in
ohio
the
remedy
is
section
2.
so
if
congress
thought
that
section
2
was
an
inadequate
remedy,
it
could
look
to
the
specifics
of
section
2
and
say,
maybe
we
ought
to
put
timetables
in
there
or
modify
it.
but
that's
not
what
happened.
they
reenacted
section
2
just
as
it
stood.
so
i
think
that
section
2
covers
even
more
broadly,
because
it
deals
with
results,
which
the
court
has
said
is
broader
than
effects.
it's
an
effective
remedy,
and
i
think
at
this
point,
given
the
record,
given
the
history,
the
right
thing
to
do
is
go
forward
under
section
2
and
remove
the
stigma
of
prior
restraint
and
preclearance
from
the
states
and
the
unequal
application
based
on
data
that
has
no
better
history
than
1972.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
i
think
that
that
referred
in
katzenbach
--
i'm
familiar
with
that
statement.
it
referred
to
the
fact
that
once
you
use
a
formula
you
are
not
--
you
are
selecting
out.
the
court
felt
the
formula
was
rational
in
theory
and
practice
and
therefore
it
didn't
on
its
face
remove
the
equality
of
the
states.
they
were
all
assessed
under
the
same
two
criteria.
some
passed,
some
did
not.
but
i
think
that
that
really
doesn't
mask
the
need
for
equal
treatment
of
the
sovereign
states.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
i
think
when
congress
uses
the
powers
delegated
under
article
i,
section
8,
it
has
substantial
latitude
in
how
it
exercises
the
power.
we
are
talking
about
remedial
power
here.
we
are
talking
about
overriding
powers
that
are
reserved
to
the
states
to
correct
abuse.
when
congress
does
that,
it
has
to
treat
them
equally.
it
can't
say--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
the
two
tests
have
a
lot
in
common
because
in
city
of
boerne,
the
katzenbach
decision
was
pointed
out
as
a
model
of
asking
the
questions
that
congress
in
proportionality
asked
us
to
address.
number
one,
how
does
this
remedy
meet
findings
of
constitutional
violation?
you've
got
to
ask
that
question.
they
asked
that
question
in
katzenbach.
what
is
the
relation
between
the
two?
and
then
i
think
you
have
to
ask
the
question:
all
right,
you
know,
is
this
killing
a
fly
with
a
sledgehammer,
a
fair
question,
because
when
you
start
to
invade
core
functions
of
the
states
i
think
that
a
great
deal
of
caution
and
care
is
required.
so
i
think
that
the
rational
basis
test,
the
mcculloch
test,
still
applies
to
delegated
powers.
but
here
on
the
one
hand
the
solicitor
defends
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
saying,
well,
if
something
doesn't
violate
the
fifteenth
it
violates
the
fourteenth.
and
the
court's
precedent
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
very
clear
that
the
city
of
boerne
congruence
and
proportionality
test
applies.
the
court
has
applied
it,
but
i
don't
think
we
--
we
wouldn't
really
need
to
get
that
far
because
we
believe
that
if
you
examine
it
under
mccullough,
just
as
they
did
in
katzenbach,
it
would
fail
as
well.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
no.
the
fifteenth
amendment
protects
the
right
of
all
to
vote
and--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
congress--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--was
reacting
--
may
i
say
congress
was
reacting
in
1964
to
a
problem
of
race
discrimination
which
it
thought
was
prevalent
in
certain
jurisdictions.
so
to
that
extent,
as
the
intervenor
said,
yes,
it
was
intended
to
protect
those
who
had
been
discriminated
against.
if
i
might
say,
i
think
that
justice
breyer--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--i
think
that
the
world
is
not
perfect.
no
one
--
we
are
not
arguing
perfectibility.
we
are
saying
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
jurisdictions
that
are
called
out
by
the
formula
are
the
places
which
are
uniquely
subject
to
that
kind
of
problem--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--we
are
not
trying--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--may
i
answer
that?
number
one,
we
are
not
looking
at
alabama
in
isolation.
we
are
looking
at
alabama
relative
to
other
sovereign
states.
and
coming
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
the
question
has
is
alabama,
even
in
isolation,
and
those
other
states
reached
the
point
where
they
ought
to
be
given
a
chance,
subject
to
section
2,
subject
to
cases
brought
directly
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
to
exercise
their
sovereignty--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--justice
sotomayor,
i
could
parse
statistics,
but
we
are
not
here
to
try
alabama
or
massachusetts
or
any
other
state.
the
question
is
the
validity
of
the
formula.
that's
what
brings
alabama
in.
if
you
look
at
alabama,
it
has
a
number
of
black
legislators
proportionate
to
the
black
population
of
alabama.
it
hasn't
had
a
section
5
rejection
in
a
long
period.
i
want
to
come
to
justice
breyer's
point
because
i
think
that
--
i
think
he's
on
a
somewhat
different
wavelength,
which
is
isn't
this
a
mere
continuation?
shouldn't
the
fact
that
we
had
it
before
mean,
well,
let's
just
try
a
little
bit
more
until
somebody
is
satisfied
that
the
problem
is
cured?
mr.
bert
w.
rein
right.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
well,
and
i
think
the
problem
to
which
the
voting
rights
act
was
addressed
is
solved.
you
look
at
the
registration,
you
look
at
the
voting.
that
problem
is
solved
on
an
absolute
as
well
as
a
relative
basis.
so
that's
like
saying
if
i
detect
that
there
is
a
disease
afoot
in
the
population
in
1965
and
i
have
a
treatment,
a
radical
treatment
that
may
help
cure
that
disease,
when
it
comes
to
2005
and
i
see
a
new
disease
or
i
think
the
old
disease
is
gone,
there
is
a
new
one,
why
not
apply
the
old
treatment?
mr.
bert
w.
rein
i
wouldn't--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--well,
it
is
certainly
not
me.
[laughter]
mr.
bert
w.
rein
but
i
think
the
question
is
congress
can
examine
it,
congress
makes
a
record;
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
problem
indeed
has
been
solved
and
whether
the
new
problem,
if
there
is
one--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--i
did
not
claim
that
power,
justice
kagan.
what
i
said
is,
based
on
the
record
made
by
the
congress,
you
have
the
power,
and
certainly
it
was
recognized
in
northwest
austin,
to
determine
whether
that
record
justifies
the
discrimination
among--
mr.
bert
w.
rein
--i
think
you
look
at
katzenbach
and
you
look
at
the
evidence
within
the
four
corners
of
the
voting
rights
act.
it
responds
to
limited
registration
and
voting
as
measured
and
the
use
of
devices.
the
devices
are
gone.
that
problem
has
been
resolved
by
the
congress
definitively.
so
it
can't
be
the
basis
for
further
--
further
legislation.
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
that
congress
looks
and
says,
well,
we
did
solve
that
problem.
as
everyone
agrees,
it's
been
very
effective,
section
5
has
done
its
work.
people
are
registering
and
voting
and,
coming
to
justice
scalia's
point,
senators
who
see
that
a
very
large
group
in
the
population
has
politically
wedded
themselves
to
section
5
are
not
going
to
vote
against
it;
it
will
do
them
no
good.
and
so
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
evidence
that
everybody
votes
for
it
would
suggest
some
of
the
efficacy
of
section
5.
you
have
a
different
constituency
from
the
constituency
you
had
in
1964.
but
coming
to
the
point,
then
if
you
think
there
is
discrimination,
you
have
to
examine
that
nationwide.
they
didn't
look
at
some
of
the
problems
of
dilution
and
the
like
because
they
would
have
found
them
all
over
the
place
in
1965.
but
they
weren't
responding
to
that.
they
were
responding
to
an
acute
situation
where
people
could
not
register
and
vote.
there
was
intentional
denial
of
the
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
bert
w.
rein
thank
you.
