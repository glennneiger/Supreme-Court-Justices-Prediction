justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
congress
passed
a
law
that
said,
everyone
whose
last
name
begins
with
a
shall
pay
a
special
tax
of
$1,000
a
year.
and
let's
say
that
tax
is
challenged
by
somebody
whose
last
name
begins
with
a.
would
it
be
a
defense
to
that
challenge
that
for
some
reason
this
particular
person
really
should
pay
a
$1,000
penalty
that
people
with
a
different
last
name
do
not
pay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
there's
no
question
that--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--there's
no
question--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--there
is
no
question
that
the
voting
rights
act
has
done
enormous
good.
it's
one
of
the
most
successful
statutes
that
congress
passed
in
the
twentieth
century
and
one
could
probably
go
farther
than
that.
but
when
congress
decided
to
reauthorize
it
in
2006,
why
wasn't
it
incumbent
on
congress
under
the
congruence
and
proportionality
standard
to
make
a
new
determination
of
coverage?
maybe
the
whole
country
should
be
covered.
or
maybe
certain
parts
of
the
country
should
be
covered
based
on
a
formula
that
is
grounded
in
up-to-date
statistics.
but
why
--
why
wasn't
that
required
by
the
congruence
and
proportionality
standards?
suppose
that
congress
in
1965
had
based
the
coverage
formula
on
voting
statistics
from
1919,
46
years
earlier.
do
you
think
katzenbach
would
have
come
out
the
same
way?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
then
why
shouldn't
it
apply
everywhere
in
the
country?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
you
do
really
think
there
was
--
that
the
record
in
2006
supports
the
proposition
that
--
let's
just
take
the
question
of
changing
the
location
of
polling
places.
that's
a
bigger
problem
in
virginia
than
in
tennessee,
or
it's
a
bigger
problem
in
arizona
than
nevada,
or
in
the
bronx
as
opposed
to
brooklyn.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
statistics
that
i
have
before
me
show
that
in,
let's
say
the
5
years
prior
to
reauthorization,
the
gap
between
success
in
section
2
suits
in
the
covered
and
the
non-covered
jurisdiction
narrowed
and
eventually
was
eliminated.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
your
time
expires,
i
would
like
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
position
on
this
as-applied
versus
facial
issue.
is
it
your
position
that
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
it
were
brought
by,
let's
say,
a
county
in
alaska
as
opposed
to
shelby
county,
alabama?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
section
5
--
the
section
5
activity
may
show
that
there's
a
problem
in
the
jurisdictions
covered
by
section
5,
but
it
says
nothing
about
the
presence
or
absence
of
similar
problems
in
noncovered
jurisdictions,
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
