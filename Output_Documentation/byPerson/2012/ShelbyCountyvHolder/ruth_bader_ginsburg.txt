congress
said
that,
too.
nobody

there
isn't
anybody
in
--
on
any
side
of
this
issue
who
doesn't
admit
that
huge
progress
has
been
made.
congress
itself
said
that.
but
in
line
with
justice
sotomayor's
question,
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
the
dissenting
judge
there,
judge
williams,
said,
"if
this
case
were
about
three
states,
mississippi,
louisiana,
and
alabama,
those
states
have
the
worst
records,
and
application
of
section
5
to
them
might
be
okay.
"
justice

you
keep
--
you
keep--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
rein,
you
keep
emphasizing
over
and
over
again
in
your
brief
registration
and
you
said
it
a
couple
of
times
this
morning.
congress
was
well
aware
that
registration
was
no
longer
the
problem.
this
legislative
record
is
replete
with
what
they
call
second
generation
devices.
congress
said
up
front:
we
know
that
the
registration
is
fine.
that
is
no
longer
the
problem.
but
the
discrimination
continues
in
other
forms.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rein,
i
just
remind,
because
it's
something
we
said
about
equal
footing,
in
katzenbach
the
court
said:
"the
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
the
states
invoked
by
south
carolina
does
not
bar
this
approach,
for
that
doctrine
applies
only
to
the
terms
upon
which
states
are
admitted
to
the
union
and
not
to
the
remedies
for
local
evils
which
have
subsequently
appeared.
"
that's
what
--
has
the
court
changed
that
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
verrilli--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
verrilli,
could
you
respond
to
the
question
that
justice
kennedy
asked
earlier,
which
was
for
why
isn't
section
2
enough
now?
the
government
could
bring
section
2
claims
if
it
seeks
privately
to
do.
why
isn't
--
he
asked
if
it
was
expensive.
you
heard
the
question,
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
majority
and
the
dissenters
agree
on
two
points.
first,
race-based
voting
discrimination
still
exist,
no
one
does
that.
second,
the
voting
rights
act
addresses
an
extraordinary
problem,
a
mere
century
of
disregard
for
the
dictates
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
congress
has
taken
extraordinary
measures
to
meet
the
problem.
beyond
those
two
points
the
court
divides
sharply.
congress
failed
to
redo
the
coverage
formula
the
court
holds
--
the
court
holds
that
that
renders
inoperative,
the
preclearance
remedy
of
section
5.
section
5
cannot
operate
without
the
formula.
section
5
is
the
provision
far
more
effective
than
any
other
in
securing
minority
voting
rights
and
stopping
backsliding.
justices
breyer,
sotomayor,
kagan,
and
i
are
of
the
view
that
congress's
decision
to
renew
the
act
and
keep
the
coverage
formula
was
in
all
together
rational
means
to
serve
the
end
of
achieving
what
was
once
the
subject
of
a
dream,
the
equal
citizenship
stature
of
all
in
our
polity,
a
voice
to
every
voter
in
our
democracy
undiluted
by
race.
most
fundamentally,
we
see
the
issue
as
a
“who
decides”
question.
in
this
regard
we
note
that
the
very
first
amendment
to
our
constitution
exhibits
a
certain
suspicion
of
congress.
it
instructs
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press.
the
civil
war
amendments
are
of
a
distinctly
different
thrust
as
the
fifteenth
amendment
instructs
that
the
right
to
vote
shall
not
be
denied
or
abridged
on
account
of
race
and
it
vests
in
congress
as
to
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendments
how
to
enforce
the
guaranteed
right
by
appropriate
legislation.
as
the
standard
setting
decision
south
carolina
v.
katzenbach
puts
it
as
against
the
reserved
powers
of
states,
congress
may
use
any
rational
means
to
effectuate
the
constitutional
prohibition
of
race
discrimination
in
voting.
congress
sought
to
do
just
that
in
1965,
when
it
initially
passed
the
voting
rights
act
and
in
each
reauthorization
including
the
most
recent
one.
indeed,
the
2006
reauthorization
was
the
product
of
the
most
earnest
consideration.
over
a
span
of
more
than
20
months,
the
house
and
senate
judiciary
committees
held
21
hearings
heard
from
scores
of
witnesses,
received
numerous
investigative
reports
and
other
documentation
showing
that
serious
and
widespread
intentional
discrimination
persist
in
covered
jurisdictions.
in
all,
the
legislative
records
filled
more
than
15,000
pages,
representative
sensen
brenner,
then
the
chair
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
described
the
record
supporting
the
authorization
as
one
of
the
most
extensive
considerations
of
any
piece
of
legislation
that
the
united
states
congress
had
dealt
with
in
the
27
and
a
half
years
he
had
served
in
the
house.
the
reauthorization
passed
the
house
by
a
vote
of
390-to-33.
the
vote
in
the
senate
was
98-to-0.
president
bush
signed
the
reauthorization
a
week
after
he
received
it,
noting
the
need
for
further
work
in
the
fight
against
injustice
and
calling
the
extension
an
example
of
our
continued
commitment
to
a
united
america
where
every
person
is
treated
with
dignity
and
respect.
why
was
congress
intent
on
renewing
section
5
particularly?
as
the
chief
justice
explained,
section
5
requires
cover
jurisdictions
to
obtain
preclearance
before
making
changes
in
voting
laws
that
might
introduce
new
methods
of
voting
discrimination.
congress
found,
first
of
all,
that
section
5
had
been
enormously
successful
in
increasing
minority
registration
and
access
to
the
ballot.
but
it
also
learned
how
essential
section
5
was
to
prevent
a
return
to
old
ways.
in
1995,
for
example,
the
state
of
mississippi
was
stopped
by
section
5
from
bringing
back
to
its
jim
crow
era
to
voter
registration
system.
and
in
2006,
texas
was
stopped
from
curtailing
early
voting
in
a
predominantly
latino
district
in
defiance
of
this
court's
order
to
reinstate
the
district
after
texas
tried
to
eliminate
it.
congress
confronted
similar
examples
of
discrimination
in
covered
jurisdictions
by
this
score.
of
signal
importance
congress
found
that
as
registration
and
voting
by
minority
citizens
impressively
increased,
other
barriers
sprang
up
to
replace
the
tests
and
devices
that
once
impeded
access
to
the
ballot.
the
second
generation
barriers
included
racial
gerrymandering,
switching
from
district
by
district
voting
to
at-large
voting,
discriminatory
annexations,
methods
more
subtle
than
the
visible
methods
used
in
1965
but
serving
effectively
to
diminish
a
minority
community's
ability
to
exercise
clout
in
the
electoral
process.
congress
retained
section
5
to
put
down
the
second
generation
barriers
before
they
got
off
the
ground.
but
the
coverage
formula
is
no
good,
the
court
insist,
for
it
is
based
on
decades-old
data
and
eradicated
practices,
so
congress
must
start
from
scratch.
but
suppose
the
record
shows
as
engaging
with
it
would
reveal
that
the
formula
continuous
to
identify
the
jurisdiction
of
gravest
concern,
jurisdiction
with
the
worst
current
records
of
voting
discrimination.
if
congress
could
determine
from
the
reams
of
evidence
it
gathered
that
these
jurisdictions
still
belonged
under
the
preclearance
regime,
why
did
it
need
to
alter
the
formula.
bear
in
mind
that
shelby
county
has
now
did
a
facial
challenge
to
the
reauthorization.
by
what
right
does
the
court
address
the
county's
claim?
on
the
basis
the
court
has
explained
that
facial
challenges
are
the
most
difficult
to
mount
successfully.
the
challenger
will
not
be
heard
to
complain
on
the
ground
at
the
statute
in
question
might
be
applied
unconstitutionally
to
others
in
situations
not
before
the
court.
congress
continued
preclearance
over
alabama
including
shelby
county
only
after
considering
barriers
remaining
there
to
minority
voting
clout.
there
were
many,
they
were
shocking,
and
they
were
recent,
they
are
spelled
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
what
has
become
of
the
court's
usual
restraint,
its
readiness
to
turn
away
facial
attacks
unless
there
is
no
set
of
circumstances
under
which
an
act
would
be
valid.
the
court
points
to
the
success
of
section
5
in
eliminating
the
test
and
devices'
extent
in
1965
and
an
increasing
citizen's
registration
and
ballot
access.
does
that
provide
cause
to
believe
section
5
remedy
is
no
longer
needed?
the
notion
that
it
does
is
hardly
new.
the
same
assumption
that
the
problem
can
be
solved
when
particular
methods
of
voting
discrimination
are
identified
and
eliminated
was
indulged
and
proved
wrong
repeatedly
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
voting
rights
act.
that
is
why
the
2006
renewal
targeted
no
particular
practices
but
instead
aimed
to
reach
in
all
their
variety
and
persistence
measures
that
effectively
impaired
minority
voting
rights.
and
it
is
why
congress
found
in
the
second
generation
barriers
demonstrative
evidence
that
a
remedy
as
strong
as
preclearance
remains
vital
and
should
not
be
removed
from
the
federal
arsenal.
it
was
the
judgment
of
congress
that
40
years
has
not
been
sufficient
amount
of
time
to
eliminate
the
vestiges
of
discrimination,
that
judgment
of
the
body
empowered
to
enforce
the
civil
war
amendments
by
appropriate
legislation
should
go
under
this
court's
unstinting
approbation.
the
great
men
who
led
the
march
from
selma
to
montgomery
and
their
call
for
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
foresaw
a
progress
even
in
alabama.
“the
arc
of
the
moral
universe
is
long,”
he
said
“but
it
bends
toward
justice
if
there
is
a
steadfast
commitment
to
see
the
task
through
to
completion.”
that
commitment
has
been
disserved
by
today's
decision.
