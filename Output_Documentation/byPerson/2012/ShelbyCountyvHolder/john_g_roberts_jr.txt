mr.

chief

john
g.
roberts,

thank
you,
counsel.
our
questions
have
intruded
on
your
rebuttal
time,
so
we'll
give
you
the
5
minutes
and
a
commensurate
increase
in
the

time.
general
verrilli?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
just
a
little
bit
about
that
record.
do
you
know
how
many
submissions
there
were
for
preclearance
to
the
attorney
general
in
2005?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
3700.
do
you
know
how
many
objections
the
attorney
general
lodged?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one,
so
one
out
of
3700.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
to
get
the
--
do
you
know
which
state
has
the
worst
ratio
of
white
voter
turnout
to
african
american
voter
turnout?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
massachusetts.
do
you
know
what
has
the
best,
where
african
american
turnout
actually
exceeds
white
turnout?
mississippi.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
state
has
the
greatest
disparity
in
registration
between
white
and
african
american?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
massachusetts.
third
is
mississippi,
where
again
the
african
american
registration
rate
is
higher
than
the
white
registration
rate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
general,
is
it
--
is
it
the
government's
submission
that
the
citizens
in
the
south
are
more
racist
than
citizens
in
the
north?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
once
you
said
it
is
not,
and
you
don't
know
the
answer
to
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
a
need
to
do
what?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
not
--
and
not
impose
it
on
everyone
else?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
the
distinction
between
facial
and
as-applied
when
you
are
talking
about
a
formula.
as
applied
to
shelby
county,
they
are
covered
because
of
the
formula,
so
they're
challenging
the
formula
as
applied
to
them.
and
we've
heard
some
discussion.
i'm
not
even
sure
what
your
position
is
on
the
formula.
is
the
formula
congruent
and
proportional
today,
or
do
you
have
this
reverse
engineering
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
--
to
the
problem
or
--
or
was
the
formula
congruent
and
proportional
to
the
remedy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well
--
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
an
extra
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
adegbile.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
do
you
agree
with
the
reverse
engineering
argument
that
the
united
states
has
made
today?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
guess
--
i
guess
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
disparity
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
differential
treatment
under
section
5.
once
you
take
away
the
formula,
if
you
think
it
has
to
be
reverse
engineered
and
--
and
not
simply
justified
on
its
own,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
much
harder
test
to
justify
the
differential
treatment
under
section
5.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
also
said
congruent
and
proportional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
limited
to
intentional
discrimination,
and,
of
course,
the
preclearance
requirement
is
not
so
limited,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
have
there
been
episodes,
egregious
episodes
of
the
kind
you
are
talking
about
in
states
that
are
not
covered?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
then
it
doesn't
seem
to
help
you
make
the
point
that
the
differential
between
covered
and
noncovered
continues
to
be
justified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rein,
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
12-96,
shelby
county
versus
holder.
voting
discrimination
against
african-americans
was
so
entrenched
and
pervasive
in
1965
that
to
cite
just
one
example,
less
than
7%
of
african-americans
of
voting
age
in
mississippi
had
been
able
to
register
to
vote.
in
contrast,
70%
of
white
citizens
of
voting
age
were
registered.
a
gap
of
63
percentage
points.
prodded
to
action
by
the
civil
rights
movement,
congress
passed
the
voting
rights
act
in
1965
to
confront
that
problem.
the
act
prohibited
racial
discrimination
in
voting
and
banned
literacy
tests
and
the
like
that
were
being
used
to
prevent
african-americans
from
voting.
those
provisions
are
not
at
issue
here.
congress
then
went
on
to
adopt
other
measures
to
address
the
extraordinary
of
the
problem
it
faced.
first,
it
required
states
to
submit
and
proposed
voting
change
to
the
united
states
attorney
general
or
a
three-judge
court
in
washington,
d.c.
before
such
a
change
could
take
effect.
this
was
a
significant
departure
from
basic
principles
of
our
federal
system.
second,
the
act
made
this
requirement
applicable
only
to
some
states,
a
similar
departure
from
the
principle
that
states
enjoy
equal
sovereignty.
the
preclearance
requirement
applied
only
those
states
that
had
a
voting
test
in
1964
and
had
less
than
50%
voter
registration
or
turnout
in
the
1964
election.
congress
recognized
that
a
voting
test
was
used
as
a
means
to
keep
african-americans
from
registering
or
voting
and
that
the
resulting
discrimination
would
show
up
in
low
voting
numbers.
the
formula
meant
that
six
states
in
the
south
were
covered,
reflecting
the
unprecedented
nature
of
this
selective
preclearance
regime,
the
provisions
were
temporary,
set
to
expire
after
five
years.
the
act
was
challenged
but
this
court
upheld
it
saying
and
i
quote,
“exceptional
conditions
can
justify
legislative
measures
not
otherwise
appropriate.”
the
act
was
extended
in
1970
for
an
additional
five
years,
in
1975
for
an
additional
seven,
in
1982
for
an
additional
25,
and
in
2006
for
an
additional
25.
the
last
time
the
coverage
formula
was
updated
however,
the
formula
for
deciding
which
jurisdictions
had
to
submit
voting
changes
was
with
the
1975
extension.
that
means
that
jurisdictions
are
covered
today
based
on
whether
they
had
a
voting
test
and
low
voter
registration
or
turnout
in
1964,
1968,
or
1972.
the
act
has
been
a
resounding
success.
you
will
recall
the
7%
registration
figure
for
african-americans
in
mississippi
in
1965,
it
was
76%
in
2004.
as
for
the
gap
of
63
percentage
points
between
african-american
and
white
voter
registration
in
that
state
in
1965,
there
was
a
gap
in
2004
of
about
4%,
but
it
was
in
favor
of
african-american
registration.
there
are
examples
of
progress,
more
poignant
than
the
numbers.
during
the
freedom
summer
of
1964
in
philadelphia,
mississippi,
three
men
were
murdered
while
working
in
the
area
to
register
african-american
voters.
on
bloody
sunday
in
selma,
alabama
in
1965,
police
beat
and
used
tear
gas
on
hundreds
marching
in
support
of
enfranchising
african-americans.
today,
both
philadelphia
and
mississippi
and
selma,
alabama
have
african-americans
mayors.
no
one
doubts
that
there
is
still
voting
discrimination
in
the
south
and
in
the
rest
of
the
country.
as
noted
when
we
upheld
the
original
act,
we
said
that
exception
conditions
can
justify
legislative
measures
not
otherwise
appropriate.
the
question
is
whether
the
extraordinary
measures
of
preclearance
and
desperate
treatment
of
the
states
that
were
upheld
45
years
ago
remained
constitutional
in
light
of
today's
changed
conditions.
now
that
question
was
before
us
four
years
ago
in
case
called
northwest
austin.
in
our
decision,
we
stated
that
the
preclearance
and
selective
coverage
features
of
the
act
“raised
serious
constitutional
questions.”
but
we
did
not
decide
those
questions
at
that
time.
instead,
we
applied
a
doctrine
known
as
constitutional
avoidance.
under
that
doctrine,
courts
should
look
carefully
to
see
if
there
is
some
way
to
decide
a
case
without
getting
into
sensitive
constitutional
issues.
we
determined
that
it
was
reasonably
possible
to
decide
the
case
on
statutory
grounds
and
we
did
so.
but
we
made
our
concerns
about
the
continued
constitutionality
of
the
preclearance
provision
and
coverage
formula
very
clear.
those
concerns
were
expressed
in
an
opinion
joined
by
eight
members
of
the
court.
congress
took
no
action
in
response.
today,
we
cannot
avoid
reaching
the
constitutional
questions.
the
arguments
that
the
preclearance
requirement
in
section
5
of
the
act
can
no
longer
be
justified
have
a
great
deal
of
force,
but
we
do
not
strike
down
that
provision.
we
do
however
find
that
the
coverage
formula
in
section
4
violates
the
constitution
and
cannot
be
used
to
decide
which
jurisdictions
are
subject
to
preclearance.
that
formula
looks
to
conditions
as
they
were
in
1972
and
earlier,
more
than
40
years
ago.
a
jurisdiction
is
subject
to
preclearance
today
if
it
employed
a
voting
test
at
that
time
or
had
done
so
since
1964
and
if
voter
registration
or
turnout
in
the
state
had
been
low
in
elections
in
the
1960s
and
early
1970s.
but
the
act
imposes
current
burdens
and
must
be
based
on
current
political
conditions
as
we
warned
four
years
ago
in
northwest
austin.
if
congress
had
started
from
scratch
when
it
extended
the
challenge
provisions
in
2006,
it
plainly
could
not
have
enacted
the
present
coverage
formula.
it
would
have
been
irrational
for
congress
to
distinguish
between
states
in
such
a
fundamental
way
based
on
40-year
old
data
when
today's
statistics
tell
an
entirely
different
story.
and
it
would
have
been
irrational
to
base
coverage
on
the
use
of
voting
test
40
years
ago
when
such
test
had
been
illegal
since
that
time,
but
that
is
exactly
what
congress
has
done.
the
government
points
to
the
extensive
record
congress
compiled
when
it
extended
the
act.
the
parties
debate
about
how
that
record
should
be
analyzed,
but
that's
not
the
point.
congress
did
not
use
that
record
as
the
basis
for
a
coverage
formula
reflecting
current
conditions.
it
instead
extended
a
formula
based
on
whether
a
jurisdiction
had
a
voting
test
40
years
earlier
and
based
on
plainly
obsolete
statistics.
any
racial
discrimination
in
voting
is
too
much,
but
our
country
has
changed
in
the
past
50
years.
in
the
last
election,
the
percentage
of
african-americans
turning
out
to
vote
exceeded
white
voter
turnout
in
five
of
the
six
states
original
subject
to
the
preclearance
requirement.
the
gap
in
the
six
state
was
less
than
one
half
of
1%.
when
taking
such
extraordinary
steps
as
subjecting
state
legislation
to
preclearance
in
washington
and
applying
that
regime
only
to
some
disfavored
states,
congress
must
ensure
that
the
legislation
it
passes
speaks
to
current
conditions.
the
coverage
formula,
unchanged
for
40
years
plainly
does
not
do
so
and
therefore
we
have
no
choice
but
to
find
that
it
violates
the
constitution.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
in
which
justices
breyer,
sotomayor
and
kagan
have
joined.
