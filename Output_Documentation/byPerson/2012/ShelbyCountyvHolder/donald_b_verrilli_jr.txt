mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there's
a
fundamental
point
that
needs
to
be
made
at
the
outset.
everyone
acknowledges,
petitioner,
its
amici,
this
court
in
northwest
austin,
that
the
voting
rights
act
made
a
huge
difference
in
transforming
the
culture
of
blatantly
racist
vote
suppression
that
characterized
parts
of
this
country
for
a
century.
section
5
preclearance
was
the
principal
engine
of
that
progress.
and
it
has
always
been
true
that
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
submissions
under
section
5
result
in
objections.
so
that
progress
under
section
5
that
follows
from
that
has
been
as
a
result
of
the
deterrence
and
the
constraint
section
5
imposes
on
states
and
subjurisdictions
and
not
on
the
actual
enforcement
by
means
of
objection.
now,
when
congress
faced
the
question
whether
to
reauthorize
section
5
in
2006,
it
had
to
decide
whether
--
whether
it
could
be
confident
that
the
attitudes
and
behaviors
in
covered
jurisdictions
had
changed
enough
that
that
very
effective
constraint
and
deterrence
could
be
confidently
removed.
and
congress
had,
as
judge
kagan
identified
earlier,
a
very
substantial
record
of
continuing
need
before
it
when
it--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
don't
know
the
precise
number,
but
many
thousands.
that's
true.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
there
was
one
in
that
year.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
i
think
--
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
why
i
made
the
point
a
minute
ago
that
the
key
way
in
which
section
5
--
it
has
to
be
the
case,
everyone
agrees,
that
the
significant
progress
that
we've
made
is
principally
because
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
and
it
has
always
been
true
that
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
submissions
result
in
objections.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
that
is
not
the
argument.
we
do
not
think
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
is
not.
congress
relied
on
far
more
on
just
the
deterrent
effect.
there
was
a
substantial
record
based
on
the
number
of
objections,
the
types
of
objections,
the
findings
of--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--but
they
are
related.
they're
related.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
do
not.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
congress
recognized
that
expressly
in
the
findings
when
it
reauthorized
the
act
in
2006.
it
said
that
the
first
generation
problems
had
been
largely
dealt
with,
but
there
persisted
significant--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
when
congress
--
the
choice
congress
faced
when
it
--
congress
wasn't
writing
on
a
blank
slate
in
2006,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
faced
a
choice.
and
the
choice
was
whether
the
conditions
were
such
that
it
could
confidently
conclude
that
this
deterrence
and
this
constraint
was
no
longer
needed,
and
in
view
of
the
record
of
continuing
need
and
in
view
of
that
history,
which
we
acknowledge
is
not
sufficient
on
its
own
to
justify
reenactment,
but
it's
certainly
relevant
to
the
judgment
congress
made,
because
it
justifies
congress
having
made
a
cautious
choice
in
2006
to
keep
the
constraint
and
to
keep
the
deterrence
in
place.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no,
but
what
congress
did
in
2006
was
different
than
what
congress
did
in
1965.
what
congress
did
--
congress
in
2006
was
not
writing
on
a
clean
slate.
the
judgment
had
been
made
what
the
coverage
formula
ought
to
be
in
1965,
this
court
upheld
it
four
separate
times
over
the
years,
and
that
it
seems
to
me
the
question
before
congress
under
congruence
and
proportionality
or
the
reasonably
adapted
test
in
mccull
--
or
whatever
the
test
is,
and
under
the
formula
in
northwest
austin
is
whether
the
judgment
to
retain
that
geographic
coverage
for
a
sufficient
relation
to
the
problem
congress
was
trying
to
target,
and
congress
did
have
before
it
very
significant
evidence
about
disproportionate
results
in
section
2
litigation
in
covered
jurisdictions,
and
that,
we
submit,
is
a
substantial
basis
for
congress
to
have
made
the
judgment
that
the
coverage
formula
should
be
kept
in
place,
particularly
given
that
it
does
have
a
bail-in
mechanism
and
it
does
have
a
bailout
mechanism
which
allows
for
tailoring
over
time.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
--
the
formula
was
--
was
rational
and
effective
in
1965.
the
court
upheld
it
then,
it
upheld
it
three
more
times
after
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
--
but
the
question
is
whether
times
had
changed
enough
and
whether
the
differential
between
the
covered
jurisdictions
and
the
rest
of
the
country
had
changed
enough
that
congress
could
confidently
make
the
judgment
that
this
was
no
longer
needed.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
yes.
with
respect
to
--
start
with
katzenbach.
katzenbach
made
the
point
that
section
2
litigation
wasn't
an
effective
substitute
for
section
5,
because
what
section
5
does
is
shift
the
burden
of
inertia.
and
there's
a
--
i
think
it
is
self-evident
that
section
2
cannot
do
the
work
of
section
5.
take
one
example:
polling
place
changes.
that
in
fact
is
the
most
frequent
type
of
section
5
submission,
polling
place
changes.
now,
changes
in
the
polling
places
at
the
last
minute
before
an
election
can
be
a
source
of
great
mischief.
closing
polling
places,
moving
them
to
inconvenient
locations,
et
cetera.
what
section
5
does
is
require
those
kinds
of
changes
to
be
pre-cleared
and
on
a
60-day
calendar
which
effectively
prevents
that
kind
of
mischief.
and
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
you
could
use
section
2
to
effectively
police
that
kind
of
mischief.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
and
i
think
it
remains--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
really
think
that
that
conclusion
follows.
i
think
these
under
the
--
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
these
under-the-radar
screen
changes,
the
polling
places
and
registration
techniques,
et
cetera.
and
in
most
of
those
i
submit,
your
honor,
the
--
the
cost-benefit
ratio
is
going
to
be,
given
the
cost
of
this
litigation,
which
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
reasons
katzenbach
said
section
5
was
necessary,
is
going
to
tilt
strongly
against
bringing
these
suits.
even
with
respect
to
the
big
ticket
items,
the
big
redistrictings,
i
think
the
logic
katzenbach
holds
in
that
those
suits
are
extremely
expensive
and
they
typically
result
in
after-the-fact
litigation.
now,
it
is
true,
and
the
petitioners
raised
the
notion
that
there
could
be
a
preliminary
injunction,
but
i
really
think
the
petitioner's
argument
that
section
2
is
a
satisfactory
and
complete
substitute
for
section
5
rests
entirely
on
their
ability
to
demonstrate
that
preliminary
injunctions
can
do
comparable
work
to
what
section
5
does.
they
haven't
made
any
effort
to
do
that.
and
while
i
don't
have
statistics
for
you,
i
can
tell
you
that
the
civil
rights
division
tells
me
that
it's
their
understanding
that
in
fewer
than
one-quarter
of
ultimately
successful
section
2
suits
was
there
a
preliminary
injunction
issued.
so,
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
basis,
certainly
given
the
weighty
question
before
this
court
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
law,
to
the
extent
the
argument
is
that
section
2
is
a
valid
substitute
for
section
5,
i
just
don't
think
that
the
--
that
the
petitioners
have
given
the
court
anything
that
allows
the
court
to
reach
that
conclusion
and
of
course--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it's
a
--
it's
a
very
substantial
number
and--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
means
i
don't
know
the
exact
number,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
it's
dozens.
and
so
the
--
and
so
it
--
so
it's
a
substantial
number.
it
is
true
in
theory
that
those
people
could
be
used
to
bring
section
2
litigation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
mail,
i
submit,
because
it's
still
--
you're
never
going
to
get
at
all
these
thousands
of
under-the-radar
changes
and
you're
still
going
to
be
in
the
position
where
the
question
will
be
whether
preliminary
injunctions
are
available
to
do
the
job.
there
is
no
evidence
that
that's
true.
and
i'll
point
out
there's
a
certain
irony
in
the
argument
that
what
--
that
what
petitioner
wants
is
to
substitute
section
2
litigation
of
that
kind
for
the
section
5
process,
which
is
much
more
efficient
and
much
more
--
and
much
speedier,
much
more
efficient
and
much
more
cost
effective.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
well,
because
i
think
congress
made
a
reasonable
judgment
that
the
problem
--
that
in
2006,
that
its
prior
judgments,
that
there
--
that
there
was
more
of
a
risk
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
continued
to
be
validated
by
the
section
2
evidence.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
think
the
combination
of
the
history,
which
i
concede
is
not
dispositive,
but
is
relevant,
because
it
suggests
caution
is
in
order
and
that's
a
reasonable
judgment
on
the
part
of
congress,
the
combination
of
that
history
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a
very
significant
disproportion
in
successful
section
2
results
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
as
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
country,
that
congress
was
justified
in
concluding
that
there
--
that
it
--
there
was
reason
to
think
that
there
continued
to
be
a
serious
enough
differential
problem
to
justify--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
--
the
--
you
have
to
look
at
it,
and
congress
appropriately
looked
at
it
through
a
broader
--
in
a
--
in
a
broader
timeframe,
and
it
made
judgments.
and
i
think
that
actually,
the
--
the
right
way
to
look
at
it
is
not
just
the
population
judgment
that
mr.
rein
was
critical
of,
the
fact
is,
and
i
think
this
is
in
the
katz
amicus
brief,
that
the
covered
jurisdictions
contain
only
14
percent
of
the
subjurisdictions
in
the
nation.
and
so
14
percent
of
the
subjurisdictions
in
the
nation
are
generating
up
to
81
percent
of
the
successful
section
2
litigation.
and
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--it
is
not,
and
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
but
i
do
think
it
was
reasonable
for
congress--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--i
--
it's
not
our
submission.
as
an
objective
matter,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
congress
had
before
it
evidence
that
there
was
a
continuing
need
based
on
section
5
objections,
based
on
the
purpose-based
character
of
those
objections,
based
on
the
disparate
section
2
rate,
based
on
the
persistence
of
polarized
voting,
and
based
on
a
gigantic
wealth
of
jurisdiction-specific
and
anecdotal
evidence,
that
there
was
a
continuing
need.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
to
maintain
the
deterrent
and
constraining
effect
of
the
section
5
preclearance
process
in
the
covered
jurisdictions,
and
that--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
--
that's
right,
given
the
differential
in
section
2
litigation,
there
was
a
basis
for
congress
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
let
me
give
two
responses,
justice
breyer.
the
first
is
one
that
focuses
on
the
practical
operation
of
the
law
and
the
consequences
that
flow
from
it.
i
do
not
think
that
shelby
county
or
alabama
ought
to
be
able
to
bring
a
successful
facial
challenge
against
this
law
on
the
basis
that
it
ought
not
to
have
covered
arizona
or
alaska.
the
statute
has
bailout
mechanism.
those
jurisdictions
can
try
to
avail
themselves
of
it.
and
if
they
do
and
it
doesn't
work,
then
they
--
they
may
very
well
have
an
as-applied
challenge
that
they
can
bring
to
the
law.
but
that
doesn't
justify
--
given
the
structure
of
the
law
and
that
there
is
a
tailoring
mechanism
in
it,
it
doesn't
justify
alabama--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--congress's
decision
in
2006
to
reenact
the
geographic
coverage
was
congruent
and
proportional
because
congress
had
evidence--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--the
court
has
upheld
the
formula
in
four
different
applications.
so
the
court
has
found
four
different
times
that
the
formula
was
congruent
and
proportional.
and
the
same
kinds
of
problems
that
mr.
rein
is
identifying
now
were--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--were
true
even
back
in
city
of
rome,
because
of
course
the
tests
and
devices
were
eliminated
by
the
statute,
so
no
--
no
jurisdiction
could
have
tests
and
devices.
and
city
of
rome
itself
said
that
the
registration
problems
had
been
very
substantially
ameliorated
by
then,
but
there
were
additional
kinds
of
problems.
the
ascent
of
these
second-generation
problems
was
true
in
city
of
rome
as
a
justification
that
made
it
congruent
and
proportional.
and
we
submit
that
it's
still
true
now,
that
congress
wasn't
writing
on
a
blank
slate
in
2006.
congress
was
making
a
judgment
about
whether
this
formula,
which
everyone
agrees,
and
in
fact
mr.
rein's
case
depends
on
the
proposition
that
section
5
was
a
big
success.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you.
i
may
need
it
for
that
question.
[laughter]
justice
scalia,
there's
a
number
of
things
to
say.
first,
we
are
talking
about
the
enforcement
power
that
the
constitution
gives
to
the
congress
to
make
these
judgments
to
ensure
protection
of
fundamental
rights.
so
this
is
--
this
is
a
situation
in
which
congress
is
given
a
power
which
is
expressly
given
to
it
to
act
upon
the
states
in
their
sovereign
capacity.
and
it
cannot
have
been
lost
on
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
that
the
power
congress
was
conferring
on
them
was
likely
to
be
exercised
in
a
differential
manner
because
it
was,
the
power
was
conferred
to
deal
with
the
problems
in
the
former
states
of
the
confederacy.
so
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
grant
of
power,
we
do
think
it
is
a
grant
of
power
to
congress
to
make
these
judgments,
now
of
course
subject
to
review
by
this
court
under
the
standard
of
northwest
austin,
which
we
agree
is
an
appropriate
standard.
that's
the
first
point.
the
second
point
is
i
do
--
i
do
say
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
--
to
look
behind
the
judgment
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
statutory
findings,
and
--
and
evaluate
the
judgment
of
congress
on
the
basis
of
that
sort
of
motive
analysis,
as
opposed
to--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
--
but
--
but
i
do
think
that
the
deference
that
congress
is
owed,
as
city
of
boerne
said,
“
much
deference
”
--
katzenbach
said
“
much
deference
”.
that
deference
is
appropriate
because
of
the
nature
of
the
power
that
has
been
conferred
here
and
because,
frankly,
of
the
superior
institutional
competence
of
congress
to
make
these
kinds
of
judgments.
these
are
judgments
that
assess
social
conditions.
these
are
predictive
judgments
about
human
behavior
and
they're
predictive
judgments
about
social
conditions
and
human
behavior
about
something
that
the
people
in
congress
know
the
most
about,
which
is
voting
and
the
political
process.
and
i
would
also
say
i
understand
your
point
about
entrenchment,
justice
scalia,
but
certainly
with
respect
to
the
senate,
you
just
can't
say
that
it's
in
everybody's
interests
--
that
--
that
the
enforcement
of
section
5
is
going
to
make
it
easier
for
some
of
those
senators
to
win
and
it's
going
to
make
it
harder
for
some
of
those
senators
to
win.
and
yet
they
voted
unanimously
in
favor
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
is
a
record
that
would
substantiate
that.
but
i
do
think
congress
was--
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
--and
we
agree
with
that,
we
respect
that,
we
acknowledge
that
northwest
austin
requires
an
inquiry
into
that.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
of
course
it
would
be
better
in
the
former
situation.
but
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
everyone
agrees
that
it
was
appropriate
for
--
for
congress
to
have
exercised
this
express
constitutional
authority
when
it
did
in
1965,
and
everybody
agrees
that
it
was
the
--
was
the
exercise
of
that
authority
that
brought
about
the
situation
where
we
can
now
argue
about
whether
it's
still
necessary.
and
the
point,
i
think,
is
of
fundamental
importance
here
is
that
that
history
remains
relevant.
what
congress
did
was
make
a
cautious
choice
in
2006
that
given
the
record
before
it
and
given
the
history,
the
more
prudent
course
was
to
maintain
the
deterrent
and
constraining
effect
of
section
5,
even
given
the
federalism
costs,
because,
after
all,
what
it
protects
is
a
right
of
fundamental
importance
that
the
constitution
gives
congress
the
express
authority
to
protect
through
appropriate
legislation.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
no.
not
--
not
--
no.
let
me
just
try
to
articulate
clearly
what
our
--
what
our
position
is.
they've
brought
a
facial
challenge.
we
--
we
recognize
that
it's
a
facial
challenge.
we're
defending
it
as
a
facial
challenge,
but
our
point
is
that
the
facial
challenge
can't
succeed
because
they
are
able
to
point
out
that
there
may
be
some
other
jurisdictions
that
ought
not
to
be
appropriately
covered,
and
that's
especially
true
because
there
is
a
tailoring
mechanism
in
the
statute.
and
if
the
tailoring
mechanism
doesn't
work,
then
jurisdictions
that
could
make
such
a
claim
may
well
have
an
as-applied
challenge.
that's
how
we
feel.
mr.
donald
b.
verrilli,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
