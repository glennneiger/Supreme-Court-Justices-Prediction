mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
extensive
record
supporting
the
renewal
of
the
preclearance
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act
illustrates
two
essential
points
about
the
nature
and
continuing
aspects
of
voting
discrimination
in
the
affected
areas.
the
first
speaks
to
this
question
of
whether
section
2
was
adequate
standing
alone.
as
our
brief
demonstrates,
in
alabama
and
in
many
of
the
covered
jurisdictions,
section
2
victories
often
need
section
5
to
realize
the
benefits
of
the
--
of
the
ruling
in
the
section
2
case.
that
is
to
say,
that
these
measures
act
in
tandem
to
protect
minority
communities,
and
we've
seen
it
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
justice
scalia--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--fair
enough.
it's
beyond
a
question
of
being
true
in
any
place.
our
brief
shows
that
specifically
in
the
covered
jurisdictions,
there
is
a
pattern,
a
demonstrated
pattern
of
section
2
and
5
being
used
in
tandem
whereas
in
other
jurisdictions,
most
of
the
section
2
cases
are
one-off
examples.
we
point
to
a
whole
number
of
examples.
take
for
example
selma,
alabama.
selma,
alabama
in
the
1990s,
not
in
the
1960s
but
in
the
1990s,
had
a
series
of
objections
and
section
2
activity
and
observers
all
that
were
necessary
to
continue
to
give
effect
to
the
minority
inclusion
principle
that
section
5
was
passed
to
vindicate
in
1965.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
the
bail-in
is
available
--
bail-in
is
available
if
there's
an
actual
finding
of
a
constitutional
violation.
it
has
been
used
in
--
in
a
number
of
circumstances.
the
united
states
brief
has
an
appendix
that
points
to
those.
one
of
the
recent
ones
was
in
port
chester,
new
york,
if
memory
serves.
but
it's
quite
clear
that
the
pattern
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
is
such
that
the
repetitive
nature
of
discrimination
in
those
places
--
take,
for
example,
the
case
in
lulac.
after
this
court
ruled
that
the
redistricting
plan
after
the
2000
round
of
redistricting
bore
the
mark
of
intentional
discrimination,
in
the
remedial
election,
the
state
of
texas
tried
to
shorten
and
constrain
the
early
voting
period
for
purposes
of
denying
the
latino
community
of
the
opportunity
to
have
the
benefits
of
the
ruling.
what
we've
seen
in
section
2
cases
is
that
the
benefits
of
discrimination
vest
in
incumbents
who
would
not
be
there
but
for
the
discriminatory
plan.
and
congress,
and
specifically
in
the
house
report,
i
believe
it's
page
57,
found
that
section
2
continues
to
be
an
inadequate
remedy
to
address
the
problem
of
these
successive
violations.
another
example
that
makes
this
point
very
clearly
is
in
the
1990s
in
mississippi.
there
was
an
important
section
2
case
brought
finally
after
100
years
to
break
down
the
dual
registration
system
that
had
a
discriminatory
purpose.
when
mississippi
went
to
implement
the
national
voter
registration
act,
it
tried
to
bring
back
dual
registration,
and
it
was
section
5
--
section
5
enforcement
action
that
was
able
to
knock
it
down.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
i
would
frame
it
slightly
differently,
chief
justice
roberts.
my
understanding
is
that
the
history
bears
some
importance
in
the
context
of
the
reauthorizations,
but
that
congress
in
--
in
none
of
the
reauthorizations
stopped
with
the
historical
backward
look.
it
takes
cognizance
of
the
experience,
but
it
also
looks
to
see
what
the
experience
has
been
on
the
ground.
and
what
congress
saw
in
2006
is
that
there
was
a
surprisingly
high
number
of
continuing
objections
after
the
1982
reauthorization
period
and
that--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--this
court
in
northwest
austin
said
that
it
needs
to
be
sufficiently
related,
and
i
think
there
are
two
principal
sources
of
evidence.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
indeed.
i
don't
understand
those
things
to
be
unrelated.
i
think
that
they're
part
of
the
same,
same
test,
same
evaluative
mechanism.
the
idea
is,
is
congress
--
the
first
question
is,
is
congress
remedying
something
or
is
it
creating
a
new
right.
that's
essentially
what
boerne
is
getting
to,
is
congress
trying
to
go
--
do
an
end-around,
a
back
doorway
to
expand
the
constitution.
we
know
in
this
area
congress
is
trying
to
implement
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
history
tells
us
something
about
that.
but
specifically
to
the
question--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--that's
correct.
but
this
court's
cases
have
held
that
congress,
in
proper
exercise
of
its
remedial
powers,
can
reach
beyond
the
--
the
core
of
the
intentional
discrimination
with
prophylactic
effect
when
they
have
demonstrated
that
a
substantial
problem
exists.
the
--
the
two
things
that
speak
to
this
issue
about
the
disparity
in
coverage
and
continuing
to
cover
these
jurisdictions,
there
are
two
major
inputs.
the
first
is
the
section
5
activity.
the
section
5
activity
shows
that
the
problem
persists.
it's
a
range
of
different
obstacles,
and
section
5
was
passed
to
reach
the
next
discriminatory
thing.
the
case
in--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--absolutely,
justice
alito.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
and
so
i
come
to
my
second
category.
the
second
category,
of
course,
is
the
piece
of
the
voting
rights
act
that
has
national
application,
section
2.
and
what
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows,
and
it
was
before
congress,
is
that
the
concentration
of
section
2
successes
in
the
covered
jurisdictions
is
substantially
more.
justice
kagan
said
that
it
was
four
times
more
adjusting
for
population
data.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
another
piece
of
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
where
peyton
mccrary
looks
at
all
of
the
section
2
cases,
and
what
he
shows
is
that
the
directional
sense,
that
the
ellen
katz
study
pointed
to
dramatically
understates
the
disparity
under
section
2.
and
so
he
found
that
81
percent--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--justice
scalia--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--justice
scalia,
it's
--
it's
a
fair
question,
and
--
and
i
was
speaking
to
the
aggregate--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--what
we
see
in
the
evidence
is
that
of
the
top
eight
states
with
section
--
favorable
section
2
outcomes,
seven
of
them,
seven
of
them
are
the
covered
jurisdictions.
the
eighth
was
bailed
in
under
the
other
part
of
the
mechanism
that,
as
justice
kennedy
points
out,
can
bring
in
some
jurisdictions
that
have
special
problems
in
voting.
and
so
we
think
that
that
points
to
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
static
statute,
it's
a
statute
that
is--
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
--fair
enough,
justice
breyer.
i
think
that
the
--
what
the
evidence
shows
before
congress
is
that
it
hasn't
run
out
yet.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
act
is
that
we
made
progress
and
congress
recognized
the
progress
that
we
made.
and,
for
example,
they
took
away
the
examiner
provision
which
was
designed
to
address
the
registration
problem.
in
terms
of
when
we
are
there,
i
think
it
will
be
some
point
in
the
future.
our
great
hope
is
that
by
the
end
of
this
next
reauthorization
we
won't
be
there.
indeed,
there
is
an
overlooked
provision
that
says
in
15
years,
which
is
now
9
years
from
where
i
stand
here
today
before
you,
congress
should
go
back
and
look
and
see
if
it's
still
necessary.
so
we
don't
think
that
this
needs
to
be
there
in
perpetuity.
but
based
on
the
record
and
a
2011
case
in
which
a
federal
judge
in
alabama
cited
this
court's
opinion
in
northwest
austin
--
there
were
legislators
that
sit
today
that
were
caught
on
tape
referring
to
african
american
voters
as
illiterates.
their
peers
were
referring
to
them
as
aborigines.
and
the
judge,
citing
the
northwest
austin
case
--
it's
the
mcgregor
case
cited
in
our
brief
--
said
that,
yes,
the
south
has
changed
and
made
progress,
but
some
things
remain
stubbornly
the
same
and
the
trained
effort
to
deny
african
american
voters
the
franchise
is
part
of
alabama's
history
to
this
very
day.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
absolutely,
chief
justice
roberts.
mr.
debo
p.
adegbile
but
the
great
weight
of
evidence
--
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
look
at
--
on
some
level
you
have
to
look
piece
by
piece,
state
by
state.
but
you
also
have
to
step
back
and
look
at
the
great
mosaic.
this
statute
is
in
part
about
our
march
through
history
to
keep
promises
that
our
constitution
says
for
too
long
were
unmet.
and
this
court
and
congress
have
both
taken
these
promises
seriously.
in
light
of
the
substantial
evidence
that
was
adduced
by
congress,
it
is
reasonable
for
congress
to
make
the
decision
that
we
need
to
stay
the
course
so
that
we
can
turn
the
corner.
to
be
fair,
this
statute
cannot
go
on
forever,
but
our
experience
teaches
that
six
amendments
to
the
constitution
have
had
to
be
passed
to
ensure
safeguards
for
the
right
to
vote,
and
there
are
many
federal
laws.
they
protect
uniform
voters,
some
protect
eligible
voters
who
have
not
had
the
opportunity
yet
to
register.
but
together
these
protections
are
important
because
our
right
to
vote
is
what
the
united
states
constitution
is
about.
