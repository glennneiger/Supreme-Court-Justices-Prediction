chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
next
this
morning
in
case
11-10189,
trevino
v.
thaler.
mr.
wolf?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
district
court,
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
has
the
texas
--
texas
appellate
courts
ever
sent
a
--
a
claim
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
far
as
you
know,
the
court
--
the
appellate
court's
never
done
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
why
does
texas
afford
people
in
your
client's
position
a
new
appellate
counsel?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
friend
says,
page
18
of
his
brief,
that
--
that
you
do.
he
says
under
texas
rule
of
appellate
procedure
21,
direct
appeal
counsel
can
supplement
the
record
with
evidence
developed
by
investigators
and
experts,
the
ones
that
are
appointed
and
paid
for
by
the
state
on
appeal.
now,
is
that
just
wrong?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
surely,
the
trial
court
in
texas,
when
it
gets
a
new
trial
motion
within
30
days
and
the
new
counsel
on
appeal
says,
what,
i
have
reason
to
believe
--
well,
we
can
see
that
there
wasn't
an
adequate
investigation
of
mitigating
circumstances
or
whatever
made
below,
and
i
would
like
the
time
to
conduct,
you
know,
the
psychological
evaluation
or
to
contact
these
witnesses,
is
the
trial
court
going
to
say
no?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
oldham?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
beyond
the
75
days?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wolf,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
are
--
what
are
these
investigators,
experts,
they're
available
to
the
new
appellate
counsel,
what
are
they
supposed
to
be
doing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
the
direct
appeal
attorney.
you
say
--
basically,
you're
saying
there's
no
way
they
can
do
anything
within
these
time
limits
and
yet,
the
state
procedure
provides
for
investigators
and
experts,
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
odd
for
them
to
provide
for
people
and
to
pay
for
people
who
can't
do
anything.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-10189,
trevino
versus
thaler
which
justice
kennedy
will
announce.
