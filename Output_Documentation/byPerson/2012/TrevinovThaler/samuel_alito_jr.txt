justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
have
the
same
questions
that
my
colleagues
have
asked.
could
you
give
us
in
a
sentence
or
two
the
test
that
you
would
like
us
to
apply?
where
a
state
does
not,
like
arizona,
prohibit
the
raising
of
this
issue
on
direct
appeal,
martinez
nevertheless
applies
where
the
state
does
--
blank.
fill
in
the
blank.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
impracticable
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
now,
that
really
would
require
a
case-by-case
determination
in
every
other
state
that
doesn't
fall
within
the
martinez
category,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
no?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that.
but
--
so
--
so
the
state
says
you
have
to
raise
this
on
direct
appeal,
but
you
have
to
comply
with
our
time
limits
on
direct
appeal.
and
they
don't
appoint
--
you
know,
you
don't
get
a
new
attorney
on
direct
appeal.
it's
the
same
attorney
who
represented
you
at
trial.
so
that
attorney
is
in
the
position
of
arguing
that
he
or
she
was
ineffective
at
trial,
and
that
would
be
okay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
have
to
raise
it
on
direct
appeal
or
it's
lost.
you
can't
wait
until
collateral
--
until
the
collateral
proceeding.
and
by
the
way,
you
don't
get
a
new
attorney.
you
get
the
same
attorney
that
represented
you
at
trial.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
you
have
the
same
system
where
you
get
a
new
attorney
but
you
have
to
comply
with
the
time
limits--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
then
you
say,
well,
i
can't
do
all
of
this
social
background
research
that
wiggins
requires
within
the
time
limits,
so
that's
impracticable.
is
that
state
okay?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
not
okay
either.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
the
reason
why
--
the
reason
why
there
was
a
movement
to
channel
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
to
collateral
review
is
that
it
is
often,
maybe
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
impracticable
to
adjudicate
them
on
direct
appeal.
so
under
your
standard,
it
seems
to
me
that
covers
every
state.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
try
this
one
more
time.
you
seem
to
say
in
your
brief
that
the
kansas
procedure
and
the
--
the
michigan
procedure
take
those
states
outside
of
the
martinez
category;
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
now,
as
i
understand
the
procedure
in
those
cases,
it
is
the
following:
on
direct
appeal,
the
attorney
can
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
based
on
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
and
if
some
threshold
is
met,
the
appellate
court
can
remand
the
case
to
the
trial
court
for
a
hearing
on
ineffective
assistance.
is
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
okay.
and
that
would
--
in
most
of
those
cases,
the
attorney
on
direct
appeal
is
going
to
be
the
attorney
who
represented
the
defendant
at
trial
and
is
probably
not
going
to
be
in
a
very
good
position
to
argue
that
he
or
she
was
ineffective
at
trial.
but
that
would
still
be
okay.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
you
don't
do
that,
you've
lost
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that
was
a
case
in
which
--
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
court
unwisely
reversed
a
certain
third
circuit
decision.
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
respondent
says
that
the
kansas
and
the
michigan
procedures
are
sufficient
to
take
the
case
--
to
take
those
states
outside
of
martinez.
you
say
your
stay
and
abate
proceeding
is
the
same,
essentially,
as
those
procedures.
his
response
is
that
texas
has
used
this
remedy
in
only
one
situation,
and
that
is
when
a
defendant
is
deprived
of
counsel
during
the
new
trial
window
and
suffers
prejudice
from
the
deprivation.
now
is
that
correct?
