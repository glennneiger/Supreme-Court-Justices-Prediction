justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
don't
know
that
you've
answered
justice
ginsburg's
question.
and
so
i'm
going
to
take
it
up,
because
it
interests
me.
let's
assume,
as
she
did
in
her
hypothetical,
that
a
state
says
--
doesn't
have
any
case
law
like
texas
does
that
says
we
prefer
you
to
go
that
way
for
non-record-based
claims.
is
the
difference
between
that
hypothetical
state
that
says
you
can
do
either
and
the
texas
situation,
is
that
texas
in
your
mind
puts
up
procedural
impediments
to
using
the
direct
appeal
mechanism,
and
so
that
if
the
other
state
hasn't
done
that,
has
made
the
development
of
evidence,
has
provided
a
full
opportunity
for
you
to
develop
a
record
before
the
direct
appeal
is
over
with,
that
state
wouldn't
be
subject
to
martinez,
and
texas
is
subject
to
it
only
because
it
has
the
procedural
impediments?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
you
--
you
started
to
answer
this
question,
but
it
is
something
raised
by
many
of
the
amici
opposing
your
position,
which
is
that
by
adopting
your
position
we're
essentially
having
to
examine
the
49
plus,
because
we
have
territories
that
have
collateral
and
direct
review
as
well,
plus
systems
to
see
which
apply
--
to
which
martinez
applies
and
to
which
martinez
doesn't
apply.
and
so
the
question
is,
how
do
we
write
this
to
sort
of
give
enough
guidance
so
that
we're
not
examining
each
of
the
49
--
or
49
systems,
or
maybe
48
after
we've
decided
martinez?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
why
should
we
not
fear
that
outcome?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
you
just
please--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--let
me
understand
what
you
are
suggesting.
counsel
doesn't
have
a
record,
he
or
she
is
newly
appointed.
can
they
go
into
court
and
say,
i
don't
know
if
there
is
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim,
but
i
need
to
protect
my
client
and
abate
this
hearing
now
until
i
get
the
trial
record,
whether
it
takes
6
months,
7
months
or
a
year.
what
will
the
court
do
with
its
rule
that
requires
counsel
to
provide
affidavits
setting
forth
the
good
faith
basis
for
a
claim?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
were
given
an
indefinite
stay
until
they
got
the
trial
record
to
set
forth
the
affidavits?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
do
you
do
with
the
75-day
rule,
which
i
think
is
absolute,
which
says
if
the
court
hasn't
ruled
on
the
new
trial
within
75
days
the
matter
ends?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
some
of
them
have
the
information
and
some
don't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
guys
who
do
it,
it's
because
they
have
the
information
and
so
they've
exhausted
their
claim.
but
we
are
talking
about
the
people
who
don't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
assumes
you
get
the
transcript.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
the
75
days
has
passed.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
if
you
haven't
made
the
new
trial
motion
within
the
30
days
initially?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
--
can
i
go
back
to
what
you
are
proposing,
and
what
you
are
saying
this
system
stands
for?
if
an
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
is
brought
on
direct
appeal
with
or
without
a
record,
or
it
says,
we
don't
have
a
record,
it
throws
it
into
collateral
review,
as
i
have
seen
it
do
dozens
of
times
--
are
you
saying
in
that
situation
that
martinez
applies?
counsel
raised
it
but
was
told,
we're
not
going
to
decide
it.
puts
them
into
collateral
review.
does
martinez
apply
there.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
forget
it
--
when
it
happens--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--okay.
so
they
haven't
gotten
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
because
they
presented
their
case
but
texas
has
said,
we
don't
want
to
do
it
here.
do
it
there.
you
are
still
saying
martinez
doesn't
apply?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
--
because
it
can
but
texas
chose
not
to,
now
there's
no
protection,
there
is
no
full
and
fair
opportunity
for
the
petitioner
to
have
had
that
claim
adjudicated?
that's
really
the
end
result
of
what
you're
saying.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
raised
it,
and
the
state
said,
wow,
go
to
collateral
review.
you're
saying,
no
martinez
protection?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
counsel
was
ineffective
in
habeas
in
that
--
in
state
habeas,
you
can
do
nothing
about
it.
