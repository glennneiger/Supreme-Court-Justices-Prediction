there's
clearly
no
martinez
protection.
the
question
you
are
being
asked,
i
think,
boils
down
to
whether
we
should
develop
a
new
case,
martinez
plus,
in
which,
even
though
there
is
technically
the
ability
to
raise
it,
which
is
all
that
martinez
spoke
about,
the
mere
fact
that
the
ability
to
raise
it
is
not
effective
enough,
should
produce
the
same
result
that
martinez
produced.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
--
i'm
not
even
sure
the
other
side
claims
that
martinez
said
what
--
what
he
is
arguing
here.
justice

it
was
the
nose
of
the
camel,
which
is
what
martinez
was
--
which
is
what
the
dissent
said,
actually.
