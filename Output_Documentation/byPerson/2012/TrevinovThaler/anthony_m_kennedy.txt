justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
--
how
do
you
want
us
to
formulate
the
rule
if
we
write
the
opinion
in
your
favor?
if
a
state
does
not
give
a
realistic
opportunity,
a
feasible
means
for
expanding
the
record
on
direct
review,
then
martinez
applies,
because
it
is
the
collateral
proceeding
that
is
the
meaningful
one
--
and
then
we
go
through
50
states
to
see
if
that
rule
applies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
justice
ginsburg's
formulation
was,
but
i
don't
understand
why
you
didn't
say,
oh,
yes,
that's
right,
there
has
to
be
one
full
fair
opportunity
to
raise
the
issue,
and
that's
what
we
are
arguing
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
the
next
--
then
my
question
is,
does
this
apply
just
to
capital
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
we
in
a
--
oh.
so
this
doesn't
apply
just
to
capital
cases
in
your
opinion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
because
of
the
rather
sharp
disagreements
in
the
briefs
on
what
the
actual
facts
are
here,
i
looked
at
the
brief
filed
by
the
state
bar
of
texas
in
support
of
neither
party.
can
you
tell
me
--
and
that
they
are
critical
of
having
new
counsel
work
simultaneously
on
a
simultaneous
timeframe
concurrently
with
the
--
with
the
new
direct
appeal
counsel.
can
you
tell
me
how
anything
that's
said
in
the
texas
bar
briefs
helps
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
--
but
the
comment
is
that
the
record
has
to
be
done
within
a
very
short
period
of
time,
and
the
trial
record
isn't
even
available
for
--
of
the
transcript
for
some
7
months.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
new
counsel
on
direct
waits
for
7
months,
gets
the
transcript.
in
the
meantime,
let's
assume
has
made
some
investigation,
and
he
said
--
and
he
tells
the
appellate
court:
we
have
some
very
important
material
that
we
want
to
introduce
and
we
need
to
supplement
the
record;
please
remand
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
has
never
happened
in
the
state
of
texas
in
a
capital
case,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
--
you
say
it's
before,
but
this
indicates
how
texas
views
its
system.
and
as
justice
ginsburg
indicates,
texas
views
this
system
as
being
one
in
which
the
collateral
appeal,
or
the
collateral
proceeding
counsel,
is
in
the
best
position
to
raise
iac
claims.
that's
--
that's
just
where
it
is.
and
the
--
the
state
bar
says,
agrees
with
the
respondent
--
pardon
me
--
with
the
petitioner
on
this
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
very
amusing
in
a
capital
case.
let
me
ask
you
this
question:
is
there
anything
in
the
state
bar
brief
that
substantially
helps
your
position?
i'm
very
interested
in
the
state
bar
brief.
it's
a
little
hard
for
me
to
parse.
it
did
say
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
in
--
between
the
habeas
counsel
and
the
counsel
on
direct.
and
it
also
--
it
also
indicates
that
the
habeas
counsel
has
to
file
the
application
in
the
convicting
court
not
later
than
180
days
after,
or
not
later
than
45
days
after
the
state's
original
brief,
which
seems
to
help
the
petitioner
here
because
the
original
brief
in
--
in
the
direct
appeal
proceeding
is
deemed
important
for
the
habeas
counsel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
75-day--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
understood
that
if
the
30-day
rule
had
been
complied
with,
within
the
75
days,
you
can
ask
the
appellate
court
to
please
remand
because
there
is
some
additional
evidence
to
be--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
be
determined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
opinion
for
the
court
as
the
chief
justice
indicates
by
--
written
by
justice
breyer,
the
bench
announcement
is
as
follows.
last
year,
in
martinez
versus
ryan,
the
court
was
faced
with
an
arizona
prisoner
who
asserted
that
his
trial
lawyer
provided
constitutionally
ineffective
assistance,
but
before
he
came
to
the
federal
court
seeking
habeas
release
â€“
relief
on
that
claim,
the
prisoner
had
procedurally
defaulted
that
claim
in
the
state
court.
under
arizona
state
law,
he
was
forbidden
to
raise
the
claim
on
direct
repeal.
the
state
instead
required
him
to
raise
a
claim
in
a
state
habeas
proceeding.
but
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
do
so.
this
was
because
he
said
of
his
lawyers
default.
so,
under
the
rule
that
this
court
had
earlier
said
out
in
coleman
versus
thompson,
the
federal
courts
could
not
consider
the
merits
or
the
petitioner's
ineffective
trial-counsel
claim
because
that
default
took
place
during
his
first
state
habeas
proceeding,
rather
than
on
state
direct
review.
but
remember,
that
in
the
martinez
case
in
arizona
procedural
rule
prevented
him
from
raising
the
inadequate
trial-counsel
claim
on
direct
review.
it
required
the
prisoner
to
raise
the
claim
of
trial
ineffectiveness
in
his
state
habeas
proceedings.
so
on
martinez
we
reasoned
that
a
narrow
exception
to
the
coleman
rule
is
necessary.
otherwise,
the
prisoner
might
be
deprived
of
any
review
at
all
of
his
ineffective
assistance
of
trial-counsel
claim.
and
so,
we
decided
that
in
arizona
a
procedural
default
would
not
bar
a
federal
habeas
court
from
hearing
the
prisoner's
substantial
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
at
trial
if
in
the
state's
initial
collateral
review
proceeding,
there
was
no
counsel
or
counsel
in
that
initial
collateral
review
proceeding
was
ineffective.
in
the
case
decided
today,
we
are
faced
with
the
prisoner
from
texas.
like
the
prisoner
in
martinez,
he
asserts
that
his
trial
lawyer
provided
ineffective
assistance.
and
like
the
prisoner
in
martinez,
he
has
procedurally
defaulted
that
claim.
and
like
the
prisoner
in
martinez,
this
prisoner
asserts
that
his
procedural
default
is
due
to
the
ineffectiveness
of
his
initial
state
habeas
lawyer.
but
here
at
texas,
unlike
arizona,
does
not
require
prisoners
to
race
ineffective
assistance
of
trial-counsel
claims
on
state
collateral
review,
rather
on
its
face,
texas
law
permits
prisoners
to
bring
such
claims
on
direct
review
and
we
must
decide
whether
this
difference
matters.
we
conclude
that
it
does
not.
as
explained
in
detail
in
today's
opinion,
the
court
concludes
that
the
texas
system
does
not
offer
most
defendants
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
present
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
on
direct
appeal.
as
a
practical
matter,
a
typical
defendant
will
not
be
able
to
race
such
a
claim
in
texas
into
state
collateral
review
proceedings.
and
so,
we
conclude
that
the
law
should
treat
the
arizona
and
texas
systems
similarly.
the
martinez
exception
applied
to
the
arizona
system
should
also
apply
in
texas.
we
vacate
the
fifth
circuit's
judgment
to
the
contrary
and
remand
the
case
before
the
proceedings.
those
proceedings
can
determine,
in
the
first
instance,
where
the
trevino's
trial
counsel
ineffectiveness
claim
is
substantial
and
whether
he
was
provided
ineffective
assistance
in
his
initial
state
habeas
proceeding.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
alito.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
thomas.
