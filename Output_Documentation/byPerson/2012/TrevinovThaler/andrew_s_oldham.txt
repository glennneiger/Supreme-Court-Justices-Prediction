mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
texas's
procedures
for
raising
ineffectiveness
claims
are
some
of
the
most
generous
in
the
country.
those
procedures
offered
petitioner
two
bites
at
the
apple.
the
first
bite
came
in
a
constitutionally
protected
direct
appeal
proceeding.
and
any
deficiency
in
that
proceeding
would
have
been
the
source
of
cause
under
existing
cause
and
prejudice
standards
to
excuse
a
subsequent
default.
allowing
the
petitioner
to
assert
cause
on
the
basis
of
a
second
bite
at
the
apple,
that
is,
a
state
habeas
proceeding,
would
create
an
unwarranted
and
unworkable
extension
of
martinez.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
justice
ginsburg,
the
very
next
sentence
of
that
opinion,
mata
v.
state,
states
that
the
lack
of
a
clear
record
usually
will
prevent
the
appellant
from
meeting
the
first
part
of
the
strickland
test
as
the
reasonableness
of
counsel's
choices
and
motivations
during
trial
can
be
proven
deficient
only
through
facts
that
don't
normally
appear
in
the
appellate
record.
so
the
only
question
presented
by
those
instructions
that
are
quoted
over
and
over
again
in
the
petitioner's
briefs
is
whether
and
to
what
extent
newly-appointed
counsel
--
as
justice
alito
was
pointing
out,
texas
provides
newly-appointed
counsel
on
direct
appeal
in
capital
cases
--
can
supplement
the
appellate
record
with
an
explanation
from
the
trial
--
trial
counsel.
and
where
the
new
counsel
gets
an
explanation
of
the
strategies
of
the
trial
counsel,
the
record
is
then
complete--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--oh,
yes,
ma'am.
it
does
mean
that.
it's
just
that
what
the
court
is
saying,
the
very
next
sentence
following
the
ones
that
are
quoted
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
says,
"the
reason
that
one
should
not
raise
an
issue
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
direct
appeal
is
because
in
cases
where
there
is
no
explanation
from
the
trial
counsel
it
will
be
impossible
to
adjudicate
the
first
prong
of
the
strickland
test.
"
it
doesn't
say
that
as
a
general
rule
you
should
just
never
do
it.
it
just
says
if
you
are
actually
going
to
raise
a
claim
of
ineffective
assistance,
you
should
create
the
proper
record
before
you
do
it.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
yes,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
why
texas
has
a
procedure
for
abating
and
remanding
appeals
that
is
materially
identical
to
the
one
that
kansas
provides
and
the
petitioner
concedes
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
this
court's
inquiry
in
martinez.
so
the
way
that
the
procedure
in
texas
would
work,
as
it
does
in
kansas,
is
that
the
newly
appointed
direct
appeal
lawyer,
who
has
no
conflict
and
is
therefore
free
to
accuse
trial
counsel
of
being
ineffective,
would
file
a
motion
to
stay
the
appeal,
abate
it
and
remand
it
to
the
trial
court.
the
showing
in
both
states
is
roughly
the
same;
it's
a
facially
plausible
claim
of
ineffectiveness.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
yes,
your
honor.
and
one
point--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
capital
case,
but
it
has
been
done
in
many,
many
noncapital
cases.
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
specifically
blessed
it,
especially
--
particularly
in
a
case
involving
a
wiggins
type
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
at
punishment
phase.
that
is
a
case
called
cooks
v.
state.
it's
cited
on
pages
32
and
34
of
our
brief.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
i
believe
it
just
needs
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of,
is
the
preferred
vehicle
if
you
have
not
developed
the
record
to
bring
a
claim
--
to
bring
a
claim
appropriately
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
well,
justice
sotomayor,
many,
many
prisoners
in
texas
in
capital
and
noncapital
contexts
alike
have
done
that
within
the
30
days,
but
i
want
to
emphasize--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--well,
if
it's
done
within
the
first
30
days,
you
don't
need
a
stay,
indefinite
or
otherwise.
you
can
just
file--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--i
think
the
easiest
way
to
think
about
it
is
there
are
basically
three
stages.
there
is
the
first
30-day
window,
and,
as
i
say,
many
capital
and
noncapital
prisoners
have
effectively
brought
their
claims
in
that
30-day
window.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
so
that's
the
first
box.
but
it's
certainly
not
the
last.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
so
to
the
second
box.
after
the
new
trial
motion
has
been
denied
by
an
operation
of
law,
you
can
make
effectively
a
factual
proffer
of
--
so
the
trial
court
no
longer
has
jurisdiction
to
grant
your
motion,
but
you
can
make
a
factual
proffer
of
what
you
would
have
shown
and
what
you
want
to
show
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
well,
we
are
still
prior
to
the
transcript
because
this
is
still--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--and
then
after
that,
there
is
no
briefing
that
has
been
done
in
the
appellate
court
at
this
point,
because
the
appellate
briefing
schedule
and
the
transcript
production
are
tied
to
one
another,
so
it
would
never
be
a
case
where
you're
actually
litigating
a
direct
appeal
without
the
transcript.
the
latter
doesn't
start
until
you
get
the
former.
and
at
that
point
you
can
make
a
motion
to
stay
and
abate
to
return
to
the
district
court
and
to
supplement
the
record
with
evidence
of
your
trial
counsel's
ineffectiveness.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
yes,
your
honor.
it
effectively
restarts
the
clock,
so
the
old
75
days
is
obviously
gone
and
you
get
a
new
35
days
on
the
stay
and
abate
motion.
so
in
that
sense,
it's
materially
identical
to
the
procedure
that
kansas
applies,
although,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
in
capital
cases,
the
state
of
texas
guarantees
its
prisoners
a
new
conflict-free
lawyer
who
can
help
with
that
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
your--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--almost
exactly,
except
that
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--you
ask
for--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--yes,
although
it's
called
a
new
trial
motion.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
it's
called
cooks
vs.
state.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
except
that
they
didn't
get
actually
get
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
cooks
because
there
was
no
facially
plausible
showing
of
the
claim
that
they
would
have
raised.
but--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--well,
your
honor,
where
he
doesn't
get
a
full
and
fair
opportunity,
whether
it's
because
his
new
lawyer
is
ineffective,
his
old
lawyer
was
ineffective,
the
transcript
wasn't
available,
the
very
case
that
we're
talking
about,
the
cooks
case,
recognizes
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and
that
prisoner
would
have
a
constitutional
claim
to
assert
for
the
failure
of
his
counsel,
the
failure
of
the
circumstances--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
could
do
one
of
two
things:
you
could
always
certify
the
question
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
if
you
thought
that
the
question
--
that
the
answer
turns
on
what
the
texas
procedures
are
and
that
the
parties
disagree
with
them.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
no,
your
honor.
and
that
is
because
the
funding
thresholds
that
are
cited
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief
are
wrong
in
two
respects.
one
is,
those
--
those
only
came
into
effect
after
the
filing
of
the
state
habeas,
and
after
the
filing
of
the
direct
appeal
in
this
case.
but
the
second,
and
perhaps
i
think
more
relevant
sense
in
which
they're
wrong,
is
it
does
apply
to
the
amount
of
money
that
are
given
to
the
lawyers,
whereas
the
subsection
(l)
provision
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
applies
to
the
money
for
investigators
and
experts.
it's
reimbursement
for
investigators
and
experts,
it's
not
the
amount
of
money
they
give
to
the
lawyer.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
yes,
your
honor,
after
1999.
but
the
state
habeas
application
in
this
case
was
filed
a
month
before
that
statute
went
into
effect.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
justice
kennedy,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
that
the
--
that
claims
of
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
properly
can
be
brought
on
direct
appeal.
the
texas
state
legislature
has
said
it
by
authorizing
a
new
direct
appeal
attorney,
and
stating
throughout
the
legislative
history
--
and
i
think
in
the
text
and
structure
of
the
statute
--
that
they
intend
for
these
claims
to
be
able
to
be
brought
on
direct
appeal
--
not
that
they
are
channeled
on
direct
appeal;
they're
not
channelled
either
way.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
justice
kagan,
i
am
aware
of
no
case
where
someone's
brought
a
new
trial
motion
that
--
in
the
procedurally
proper
way,
and
been
told
not
to
do
it
that
way.
i
think
what
we--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--no,
your
honor.
that's
--
that's
the
usual
response
when
the
record
is
insufficient.
that
is,
when
you
haven't
you
haven't
given
your
trial
lawyer--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--your
honor,
that's
not
what
happened
in
the
armstrong
case,
where
someone
brought
a
wiggins
--
it's
not
what
happened
in
the--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--your
honor,
it's
--
it's
not
the
only
case.
we
have
--
a
similar
claim
was
raised
in
the
motley
case,
which
was
cited
in
our
brief.
it
was
also
raised
in
a
rosales
case,
also
cited
in
our
brief.
similar
to
wiggins
kinds
of
cases.
and
then
--
in
the
motley
case,
they
were
able
to
have
school
teachers
testify.
there
was
a
neurological
examination
done.
it's
certainly
a
practical
way
to
do
it,
and
it
--
it
is
as
generous
or
more
generous
than
a
lot
of
the
states
in
the
country,
including
states
that--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--with
no
new
trial
and
no
new
standing
abatement?
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
if
there
was
no
opportunity
to
develop
--
to
develop
the
facts,
and
there
was
practically
no
opportunity
to
raise
the
claim
on
direct
appeal,
i
think
the
question
would
still
turn
on
whether
and
to
what
extent
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
have
an
effective
appeal
of
that
issue.
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
afforded
constitutional
protection
to
that
new
trial
window,
and
to
the
meaningfulness
of
the
record
necessary
to
raise
these
claims
on
direct
appeal.
and
i
think
that
is
what
is
sufficient
to
move
this
case
out
of
the
martinez
box
and
into
the
normal
cause
and
prejudice
standards
that
this
court
applies--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--it
can
happen
in
every
single
case
when
there
was
no
opportunity--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--oh,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
martinez
would
apply
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
precisely,
because
there
is
no
default
upon
which
to
apply
martinez.
so
there's
nothing
--
there
is
no
work
for
martinez
to
do
in
that
hypothetical,
precisely
because
the
claim
can
be
met.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
well,
i'm
certainly
not
suggesting
that
the
rule
needs
to
turn
on
the
meaningfulness
of
the
opportunity
to
raise
it
on
direct
appeal.
i
think
that
martinez
was
very
clear
when
it
said
--
whether
it's
a
complete--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--well,
you
don't
--
there's
nothing
to
do
in
the
sense
that
in
that
very
hypothetical,
that
very
claim
could
be
raised
in
habeas
the
first
time,
but
it
also
could
be--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--i
think
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia,
and
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
sotomayor
was
asking,
the
court's
ordinary
cause
and
prejudice
standards
would
accommodate
for
that,
there
would
be
no
inequity
for
the
court
--
for
martinez
to
do
anything.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
well,
if
the
--
if
the
court
by
hypothesis
is
telling
the
bar
not
to
bring
claims
under
any
set
of
circumstances
on
direct
appeal,
i
think
that--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--justice
breyer,
martinez
should
not
apply,
even
to
that
hypothetical.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
i'm
not
sure
how
to
answer
the
full
and
fair
opportunity
question,
because
that's
certainly
not
the
standard
that
we
are
advocating
here.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
we
believe
that
martinez
applies
where
it
said
that
it
applies,
and
that
is
where
a
state
makes
a
deliberate
choice
to
disallow
all
claims
on
direct
appeal,
we
understand
the
necessity
to
having
a
martinez
clause
to
apply
to
an
eventual
default.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--justice
kennedy,
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
the
state
bar
brief
that
helps
either
side
in
this
sense
because
the
state
bar
agrees
that
there
were
no
relevant
guidelines
of
any
kind
at
the
time
of
any
of
the
proceedings
in
this
case.
the
only
guideline
that
any
bar
association
had
promulgated
at
the
time
of
the
direct
appeal
proceeding
or
state
habeas
proceeding
in
this
case
was
the
1989
american
bar
association
guideline
11.9.2,
which
specifically
told
the
direct
appeal
lawyer
in
this
case
to
raise
every
colorable
claim
he
could,
regardless
of
any
state
procedures
to
the
contrary.
and
if
he
had
raised
a
substantial
wiggins
claim
or
if
he
had
even
tried
his
best
to
raise
a
wiggins
claim
that
could
be
amplified
and
further
developed
on
state
habeas,
we
wouldn't
be
standing
here
today
because
it
would
have
been
properly
exhausted
and
adjudicated
on
the
merits
at
the
state
court.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
bar
association
really
has
anything
one
way
to
say
or
the
other,
which
is
maybe
why
it
filed
on
behalf
of
neither
party.
but
to
return
to
justice
breyer's
question,
i
don't
think
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
to
come
up
with
anything
new.
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
outside-of-martinez
world
is
actually
very
old.
we
are
just
talking
about
the
carryover
rule,
the
normal
rule
that
applies
to
cause
and
prejudice
for
all
defaults
in
states
across
the
country.
and
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
understand
it
is
to
imagine
in
the
very
hypothetical
that
you
offered
where
there
is
just
one
person
who
could
get
through,
that
person
would
have
a
constitutional
claim
in
the
state
of
--
i'm
sorry,
the
other
900
or
however
many
there
were,
those
people
would
have
constitutional
claims
in
the
state
of
texas
for
the
deprivation
of
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
press
their
claims
on
direct
appeal.
and
as
from
the
federal
--
and
that
would
serve
as
cause,
if
the
state
courts
denied
it,
that
would
serve
as
cause
to
overcome
a
default
in
federal
court
and
to
get
an
adjudication
of
that
claim.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
justice
kagan,
there
is
no
work
for
an
equitable
rule
in
martinez
to
do
if
you
can
get
there
another
way.
and
it's
not
just
that
you
can
raise
it
on
direct
appeal,
it's
also
that
if
your
direct
appeal
lawyer
doesn't
do
it,
you
can,
under
certain
circumstances,
establish
cause
against
your
direct
appeal
lawyer
to
overcome
an
ensuing
default.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
i'm
not
sure
about
specifically
wiggins
claims,
but
yes,
it
is
in
fact
established
in
the
leading
treatise
on
texas
practice
cited
on
both
sides
that
it
is
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
to
fail
to
develop
the
record
to
allow
any
claim
to
be
adjudicated
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
no,
justice
ginsburg,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
particular
case
on
wiggins
in
particular.
but
the
claims
against
appellate
ineffectiveness
for
failure
to
raise
a
claim
on
direct
appeal
are
raised
and
adjudicated
on
the
merits
all
the
time
in
texas
courts.
and
there
are
specific
ones
that
say
that
ineffective
assistance
of
appellate
counsel
to
fail
to
develop
the
record
using
the
procedures
which
the
state
has
allowed
through
the
new
trial
window.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
no,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
an
expectation
that
the
extra-record
evidence
will
be
developed
either
through
the
new
trial
proceeding,
through
a
factual
proffer
following
it,
or
through
a
stay
and
abatement
procedure
to
make
sure
that
when
the
claim
actually
gets
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
it
has
a
record
upon
which
to
adjudicate
the
claim.
that's
all
that
--
and
to
the
extent
that
the
appellate
lawyer
fails
to
do
that,
he
can
constitute
cause
under
the
ordinary
rules
of
cause
and
prejudice
without
creating
another
martinez
exception,
which
we
would
submit
is
going
to
be
highly,
highly
unworkable
given
that
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
determine
when
is
a
little
bit
enough
and
when
is
not
enough
sufficient
for
martinez.
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
it's
when
the
counsel
--
when
the
prisoner
has
suffered
a
deprivation
of
the
opportunity
to
develop
the
record
in
the
new
trial
window.
so
in
the
cooks
case,
for
example,
that
was
--
there
was
only
a
lawyer
for
10
of
the
30
days,
and
the
court
said
the
new
trial
window
is
a
critical
stage
for
the
development
of
a
particular
record
for
raising
a
wiggins-style
claim
on
direct
appeal,
and
because
that
is
so--
mr.
andrew
s.
oldham
--and
because
that
is
so,
where
there
has
been
a
deprivation
of
counsel
in
that
circumstance
that
prohibits
the
development
of
that
meaningful
record,
we
will
allow
you
to
go
back,
assuming
you
can
show
prejudice.
