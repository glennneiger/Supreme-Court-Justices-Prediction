so
if
everything
--
if
everything
in
texas's
system
were
the
same,
but
you
had
a
year,
would
that
flip
texas
into
a
different
category?
justice
elena
kagan
is
the
problem,
is
what
makes
this
impracticable
just
the
amount
of
time?
justice
elena
kagan
please--
justice
elena
kagan
--well,
able
to
be
brought,
mr.
oldham,
but
as
justice
ginsburg
started
off
by
saying,
many
times
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
the
preferred
method
is
to
bring
it
on
collateral
appeal.
and
more
to
the
point
even,
when
attorneys
try
to
bring
these
kinds
of
claims
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
typical
response
is
to
say,
no,
this
is
not
the
proper
venue
for
that,
go
back
and
do
it
again
on
collateral
review.
so
we
have
--
you
say
that
there's
a
formal
mechanism
that
could
be
used.
but
it
seems
as
though
the
courts
and
the
lawyers
both
in
texas
are
being
told
continually,
don't
use
that
form
of
mechanism.
instead,
do
this
on
collateral
review.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
isn't
the
usual
response
just
to
dismiss
it
without
prejudice
and
to
say,
we
don't
have
time
to
deal
with
this,
go
away,
come
back
again
on
collateral
review?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
because
mostly
the
record
isn't
sufficient
for
a
wiggins
claim.
so
anytime
somebody
brings
a
wiggins
claim
on
this
30-day
window,
the
court
says,
you
know,
there's
only
30
days.
the
record
is
insufficient.
go
away,
do
it
again.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
your
one
case,
it
seems
to
me.
you
only
have
one
case.
it's
armstrong.
armstrong
seems
to
me
sort
of
like
proof
as
to
why
it
is
that
the
texas
courts
don't
do
that
generally,
because
what
they
did
in
armstrong
was
they
ended
up
trying
to
adjudicate
that
on
the
merits,
and
realizing
that
there
was
--
that
the
record
wasn't
sufficient.
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
agree,
mr.
oldham,
that
if
you
did
not
have
the
mechanism
for
a
new
trial,
then
you
would
form
under
the
martinez
rule?
justice
elena
kagan
in
other
words,
no
opportunity
for
factual
development.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
oldham,
i
had
thought
that
martinez
was
really
an
equitable
rule.
it
was
an
equitable
rule
about
giving
people
an
opportunity
to
raise
a
trial
ineffectiveness
claim.
and
if
it's
true
that
although
texas
has
a
technical
possibility
of
doing
that
outside
of
collateral
review,
but
in
fact
that
the
lawyers
are
told
not
to
use
that
route,
that
the
lawyers
don't
use
that
route,
that
if
they
do
use
that
route
the
likelihood
is
that
they
will
be
thrown
out
for
using
that
route,
the
question
is
why
that,
the
formal
availability
of
a
mechanism
that
nobody
uses
and
that
everybody
is
told
not
to
use
should
matter
with
respect
to
the
application
of
an
equitable
rule
like
martinez?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
are
suggesting
that
if
an
attorney
is
appointed
within
a
few
days
or
within
a
week,
as
happened
here,
that
in
that
case
there
would
not
be
that
opportunity,
it
would
be
the
30
days,
that's
it,
stop.
