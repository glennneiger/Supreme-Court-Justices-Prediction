mr.
warren
a.
wolf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
repeatedly,
quote
"as
a
general
rule,
a
defendant
should
not
raise
an
issue
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
on
direct
appeal.
"
and
has
recognized
that
texas
procedure
make
it
quote,
"virtually
impossible
for
appellate
counsel
to
adequately
present
such
a
claim.
"
those
claims
of
the
choices
made
by
the
sovereign
state
of
texas
and
it
renders
this
case
just
like
martinez.
this
case
well
illustrates
the
consequences
of
that
choice.
the
transcript
in
this
case
was
not
ready,
available
for
7
months.
that's
4
1/2
months
after
the
trial
lost
--
trial
court
lost
jurisdiction
on
any
new
trial
motion.
the
state
itself
argued,
quote,
in
sprouse,
"without
access
to
that
record,
new
counsel
would
have
little
basis
for
attacking
the
performance
of
trial
counsel.
"
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
texas
systemically
channels
ineffective
assistance
claims
to
collateral
--
to
state
habeas.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
it's
not
just
them
saying
it
in
words,
but
it's
also
saying
it
in
the
legislation
and
in
the
rules
that
the
state
of
texas
has
adopted.
in
order
to
expand
the
record
in
a
wiggins
claim,
which
is
what's
the
basis
of
mr.
trevino's
claim,
in
order
to
expand
that
record,
you
have
a
30-day
window
to
file
a
motion
for
new
trial,
and
75
days
--
75
days
to
have
a
hearing
on
it
or
else
the
court
loses
jurisdiction
by
operation
of
law.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
that's
correct.
and
so
you
couldn't
expand
the
record.
and
in
order
to
present
a
wiggins
claim
especially,
it
takes
a
considerable
amount
of
extra
record
investigation.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
after
75
days,
the
district
court
loses
jurisdiction,
and
i
realize
there
are
some
jurisdictions
around
the
country
that
have
that
opportunity,
but
texas
has
a
finality
where
there
is
no
provision
to
expand
the
record
after
that
75-day
period.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
that's
correct.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
there's
two
--
actually,
texas
has
a
dual
track
system.
it
was
developed
in
1995,
a
year
before
the
federal
system
was
developed
in
aedpa.
and
the
concept
--
and
the
reason
for
it,
the
rationale
was
to
expedite
these
type
of
claims,
especially
in
death
penalty
claims
under
section
11.071,
but
the
--
and
the
purpose
is
that
there
is
two
counsels
that
are
appointed.
one
counsel
is
appointed
to
handle
the
record-based
claims,
and
that's
done
on
direct
appeal.
the
other
counsel
is
appointed
in
all
cases,
there's
no
question,
on
habeas.
and
that
attorney,
that
counsel
is
appointed
with
the
understanding
that
he's
going
to
have
the
time
to
do
the
extra-record
based
claims.
in
a
case
like
this,
the
record
wasn't
even
prepared
for
seven
months
after
the
date
of
the
judgment.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
that's
correct,
because
the
--
the
scheme
that
texas
has
developed
systemically
channels
the
habeas
claim,
the
iac
claim,
the
ineffective
assistance
claim,
into
habeas.
there
is
no
--
to
say
that
it
could
be
done
is
really
an
illusion.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
it
wouldn't
really
affect
50
states
because
some
states
provide
a
mechanism
for
an
abatement
to
go
back
on
direct
appeal
and
--
and
expand
the
record.
other
states
require
that
it
go
to
direct
appeal.
and
each
--
and
those
states
made
--
have
made
a
choice.
and
texas
has
made
a
choice
by
developing
this
scheme.
and
as
far
as
the
other
states,
they
would
have
to
compare
themselves
to
the
situation
that
--
that
we
would
--
that
would
come
out
of
this.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
when
it
makes
it
impracticable
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
to
raise
the
claim
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
not
necessarily--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--justice
alito,
because
there's
--
some
states
require
that
their
cases
are
directed
back
to
--
to
direct
appeal
and
there's
a
mechanism
to
expand
the
record.
there
is
some
--
there
is
--
some
require
it
to
go
to
direct
appeal.
but
in
texas,
what
we
have
is
a
limitation
that's
the
rules
that
texas
supreme
court
has
devised,
with
texas--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--if
the
--
let
me
make
sure
i
understand.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
no.
because
the
new
--
the
old
attorney,
the
trial
attorney
is
in
the
worst,
really,
position
to
understand
his
ineffectiveness.
there
is
a
disincentive
for
him--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--and
that--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--no,
because
that's--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--because
that
state
is
--
in
the
texas
scheme,
in
the
texas
scheme,
the
--
texas
gives
us
another
attorney
in
this
dual
track,
this
system,
and
it's
understood
that
that
attorney
is
the
habeas
attorney,
and
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
have
that
time
limitation
that
the
direct
appeal
attorney
has,
that's
--
that
75-day
limitation.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
but
the
bottom
line
in
--
in
our
situation
in
texas
is
that
we
have
a
scheme.
we
have
a
set
of
--
of
laws
and
--
and
rules
that
channel
these
type
of
claims.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
first
of
all,
the
rule
--
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
21.8
talk
about
the
limitations
of
--
the
number
of
days
that
you
have
to
expand
the
record
in
a
motion
for
new
trial.
75
days,
the
district
court
loses
jurisdiction,
they
cannot
hear
anything
else
on
this
case.
the
record
in
this
case
wasn't
even
available
for
7
months
after
the
date
of
the
trial.
so
even
with
a
new
attorney
that's
appointed
--
first
of
all,
that
new
attorney
is
a
stranger
to
the
case.
he
doesn't
know
anything
about
the
case.
he's
not
in
a
position
to
talk
to
the
client.
the
client
is
not
the
best
person
to
understand
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
so
he's
got
to
wait
on
that
--
on
that
trial
record,
first
of
all,
to
see
what's
there.
and
then--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--i'm
sorry
if
i
missed
that,
but
that's
exactly
the
point.
and
that's
what--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--no.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
not
necessarily.
but
the
--
in
the
capital
arena
in
texas,
we
have
the
dual-track
system,
where
you
get
an
attorney
appointed
automatically
in
a
habeas
setting,
where
in
a
non-death
penalty
setting
there
is
a
possibility
of
getting
an
attorney
in
the
interest
of
justice,
but
it's
not
always
guaranteed.
and
in
that
case,
the
appeal
is
done
in
a
successive
way,
not
in
this
dual-track
way.
and
in
--
in
the
death
penalty
arena,
it
manifests
--
it
makes
it
even
more
manifestly
obvious
that
there
is
a
systematic
channeling
by
the
state
referring
these
type
of
claims
into
habeas,
while
the
state
attorney,
the
district
appeals
attorney,
focuses
on
the
record-based
claim,
and
the
habeas
attorney
is
dealing
with
all
of
the
case,
not
just
the
trial,
but
the
--
the
appeal,
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
ineffectiveness
on
his
part,
and
also
to
do
the
investigation
on
the
extra-record-based
claims,
which
takes
a
substantial
amount
of
time.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
right.
well,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--okay.
i
would
suggest
the
rule
to
be
that
martinez
applies
when
a
state
channels
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
to
state
habeas
and
makes
it
impracticable
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
to
raise
the
claim
on
direct
appeal.
and
in
answer
to
your
question
about
all
of
the
states,
many
of
the
states
do
make
it
--
do
make
habeas
available
in
the
direct
appeal
arena.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
it
wouldn't,
justice
alito,
for
this
reason.
many
states
have
a
mechanism,
unlike
the
texas
scheme,
which
permits
the
expansion
of
the
record.
some
states,
like
utah,
who
authored
the
amicus
brief,
has
a
rule
21.3
which
permits
the
claimant
to
go
back
and
expand
the
record.
we
don't
have
that
ability
in
texas.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
yes.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is,
in
order
to
obtain
a
record,
one,
you
need
to,
when
you
file
your
motion
for
new
trial,
you
have
to
specifically
set
out
the
factual
basis
for
the
claim;
and
two,
the
affidavit
has
to
identify
the
evidence
that
any
further
investigation
would
have
revealed.
so
you've
got
that
30-day
window
when
you
file
that
motion
for
new
trial
that
you
have
to
do
all
of
those
things.
and
that's
not
enough
time.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
if
the--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--yes,
because
the
time
--
the
time,
especially
in
a
wiggins
claim,
is
prohibitive
in
order
to
be
able
to
prepare
and
not
just
the
time
there,
but
the
time
that
is
imposed
by
the
rules
of
--
of
appellate
procedure.
that
75-day
window
in
order
to
expand
the
record
is
part
of
this
whole
system
that
it's
understood
that
the
habeas
claim
is
the
--
the
iac
claim
is
channelled
into
habeas.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
yes.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
yes.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
but
it's
a--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--well,
there's
a
problem
with
declaring
yourself
ineffective.
one,
it's
--
it's
kind
of
counterintuitive.
in
texas,
if
you
declare
yourself
ineffective,
there's
repercussions.
you're
no
longer
available
to
--
you
know,
be
taken
off
the
list
to
get
appointments
on
these
type
of
claims.
and
--
and
it's
also
against
the
bar
rules
to
--
to
have
that
adverse
interest
against
your
client.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
that,
as
far
as
their
state,
you
know,
other
states
are
concerned,
you
know,
those
are
problems
within
those
states.
but
as
far
as
texas
is
concerned,
you
know,
we
are
in
a
situation
that
we
find
ourselves
in
--
in
a
martinez
situation
where
there
was
no
ability
to
--
to
raise
--
the
system
that
we
have
prevents
you
from
raising
this
claim.
and
as
far
as
the
other
states
are
concerned,
some
of
the
states
have
a
more
liberal
opportunity
to
--
to
expand
the
record,
but
that's
not
the
system
that
we
have
in
texas.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
it
--
it
takes
a
while.
i'm
not
going
to
say
a
long
while,
but
releases
are
required,
sometimes
there's
opposition
to
releasing
those
records.
but
the
biggest
part
of
this
whole
problem
is
getting
the
record,
is
also,
in
our
situation,
to
have
mr.
trevino
evaluated
regarding
his
--
there
was
never
a
psychological
or
sociological
study
done
in
his
case,
and
to
have
a
psychological
eval
done,
that
doesn't
happen
in
30
days.
and
one,
you've
got
to
get
the
records
and
in
some
of
these
situations,
one
record
leads
to
another
record,
and
finding
one
witness
leads
to
another
witness.
and
by
the
time
you
start
developing
all
these
other
avenues
and
when
you
put
all
that
together,
then
you're
in
a
position
to
present
that
to
an
expert
in
order
to
make
that
sort
of
evaluation.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
that's
correct
because
the
30
days
is
--
is
a
limit;
it's
a
bar.
that's
all
he
has.
and
in
addition,
the
--
the
trial
--
the
direct
appeal
attorney
has
his
own
responsibilities.
there's
a
division
of
labor
that's
here
that
the
direct
appeal
attorney
is
supposed
to
review
the
entire
record
to
look
for
all
of
whatever
errors
that
might
be
there.
and
while
--
and
that's
why
in
texas
where
you
have
this
dual
track
system
in
order
to
expedite
the
appeal,
there
is
a
new
attorney
that's
appointed
to
do
the
habeas
work.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
it
helps
our
case
because
it
recognizes
the
dual
track
system
and
it
recognizes
that
the
extra
record
under
section
12.22
of
the
guide
--
of
the
texas
guidelines
that
were
formulated
that
the
state
bar
was
--
one
of
their
committees
on
indigent
defense
helped
develop.
they
recognize
the
fact
that
extra
record
investigation
is
the
responsibility
of
the
habeas
counsel.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this
abatement
issue.
the
abatement
issue,
as
justice
alito
just
said,
is
only
available
as
referred
in
our
brief
on
page
6,
is
only
available
when
there
is
a
denial
of
the
constitutional
right
to
an
attorney.
and
those
situations
is
when
there's
a
delay
in
appointing
the
direct
appeal
attorney
after
the
trial.
so
during
the
30-day
window
to
file
the
motion
for
new
trial,
that
time
limitation
is
--
is
--
that
clock
is
running,
and
if
there's
no
attorney
appointed,
the
constitutional
violation
is
considered
a
critical
stage
of
the
trial.
and
since
there's
--
if
there's
no
attorney
appointed
during
those
30
days,
that
is
the
only
time,
as
justice
kennedy
is
correct
in
saying,
that
that
is
the
time
that
the
abatement
procedure
is
permitted.
that
is
the
only
time.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
and
when
that
new
--
that's
correct.
and
if
a
new
attorney
is
appointed,
because
there
was
no
attorney
appointed,
that
new
attorney,
he
himself
also
has
only
30
days.
the
clock
starts--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--that's
not
true.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
our
briefs,
to
the
--
to
the
time
that
the
authorities
that
we
cite
and
also
the
amicus
brief
from
the
state
bar
of
texas.
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
to
the
direct
appeal
attorney?
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
well,
they
don't
--
to
do
a
wiggins
claim,
to
do
--
they're
doing
things
that
would
--
investigates
things
that
came
out
of
the
record,
because
that's
what
is
relegated
to
the
direct
appeal.
the
habeas
attorney
has
more
money
available
and
has
more
time
available
to
do
the
things,
and
it
becomes
a
function
of
time
as
well.
but
i
want
to
direct
the
court's
attention
also
to
the
--
to
the
statement
in
sprouse.
and
--
and
the
statement--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--in
the
case
of
sprouse
in
our
--
it's
page
20
of
our
reply
brief.
that
the
position
in
sprouse
is
that
there
would
be
no
constitutional
defect
if
appellate
counsel
didn't
have
time
or
the
record
to
raise
the
ineffective
assistance
claim,
and
that's
because
the
habeas
proceeding
is
available
to
direct
--
to
develop
the
claim
and
is
the
proper
place
to
do
so.
and
that's
the
state's
brief.
it's
on
page
20
of
our
reply
brief.
the
other
thing
that
i
wanted
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
is
that
the
respondent
cites
a
couple
of
cases
that
are
aberrant
--
they're
aberrations
and
they
really
don't
--
shouldn't
--
since
this
court
has
--
has
brought
out
a
sensible
rule
in
martinez
and
this
court
has
said
this
court's
rule
sensibly
speak
to
the
ordinary
case,
not
the
aberrational.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
the
last
thing
that
i
wanted
to
say
is
--
is
that
the
direct
appeal,
if
--
if
--
there's
a
choice
here
that
the
state
has
systemically
developed
a
system
that
has
caused
--
that
has
directed
attorneys
on
appeal
that
the
habeas
attorney
does
the
extra-record
claims,
the
wiggins-type
claims,
and
that
the
claims
that
are
raised
on
the
record
go
to
the
direct
appeal
attorney.
that
is
the
system
that
the
state
has
developed.
those
are
the
rules
that
govern
this
system
that
have
been
promulgated
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
the
supreme
court,
and
that's
the
system,
the
scheme
that
we
are
under.
and
because--
mr.
warren
a.
wolf
--we're
just
looking
for
the
--
because
of
the
procedural
defaults
scenario
that
we
find
ourselves
in,
we
tried
to
do
that.
and
--
and
because
1107.1
also
has
--
when
they
--
when
that
was
promulgated
in
1995
in
order
to
expedite
these
claims,
it
provided
three
things:
one,
a
new
attorney;
two,
the
money
to
fund
those
claims;
and
three,
an
abuse
of
the
writ,
which
is
section
58,
which
is
what
we
met
in
--
in
our
case.
the
texas
scheme,
because
of
that
abuse
of
the
writ,
proceeds
--
causes
procedural
default,
and
that
puts
us
in
this
quandary
where
a
person
like
mr.
trevino
is
unable
to
get
relief
because
he
has
an
ineffective
trial
lawyer
and
now
he
is
--
that
ineffective
trial
lawyer,
his
ineffectiveness
is
being
insulated
by
the
ineffectiveness
of
his
--
of
his
habeas
lawyer.
and
that's
not
what
should
happen.
it's
--
it's
just
not
equitable,
it's
not
fair.
and
mr.
trevino,
someone
in
his
situation,
should
have
a
right
to
complain
about
the
ineffectiveness
of
his
trial
lawyer.
