justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
state's
position
were
not
as
you
accurately
have
stated
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeal.
it
didn't
say
collateral
review
is
the
preferred
route.
it
said
either
way
will
do.
you
can
bring
it
up
on
direct
appeal
or
you
can
bring
it
up
on
collateral.
would
you
say
that
martinez
applies
in
that
situation,
or
does
it
depend
on
having
the
state
highest
court
in
the
matter
saying,
this
is
the
preferred
way
to
go?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
it
didn't,
if
it
just
said,
you
can
bring
it
up
on
direct,
but
we
realize
these
limitations,
because
the
transcript
won't
be
ready,
so
you
can
wait
and
bring
it
up
on
habeas.
i'm
just
saying
how
far
--
the
rule
that
you
would
like
us
to
adopt,
you
said
this
is
just
like
martinez.
is
that
where
you
would
draw
the
line,
that
the
state's
highest
court
has
to
say,
we
prefer
this
matter
to
be
brought
up
on
collateral
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
your
point
that
he
has
to
have
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
make
the
wiggins
claim,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
direct
or
collateral?
i
think
you
mentioned
that
at
least
one
state
requires
you
to
do
it
on
direct,
but
does
provide
for
developing
the
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
the
rules
other
than
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
having
said
in
several
decisions
the
preferred
route
is
collateral
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
that
is
the
system
in
kansas
and
michigan,
then
why,
why
is
it
outside
martinez,
if
the
point
is
you
can't
effectively
present
the
ineffective
assistance
counsel
when
you've
got
the
same
counsel
who
was
alleged
to
have
been
ineffective
and
is
not
going
to
condemn
himself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
explain
why
the
time
that
you
have
on
direct
appeal
isn't
adequate.
so
you
say
you
need
--
need
to
investigate.
well,
some
of
the
things
like
school
records,
his
prison
records,
it
doesn't
take
a
long
time
to
get
those,
does
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
it
a
second
bite
when
the
texas
supreme
court,
court
of
criminal
appeals,
has
said
again
and
again,
as
a
general
rule,
defendants
should
not
raise
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
on
direct
appeal,
should
raise
it
on
collateral
review?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
--
does
the
statement
"defendants
should
not
raise
ineffective
assistance
of
trial
counsel
on
direct
appeal.
"
doesn't
mean
what
it
says?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
when
it
ruled
in
favor
of
texas
but
said
in
the
ibarra
case
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
made
it
clear
that
state
habeas
petitions
--
and
the
state
habeas
petition
is
the
preferred
vehicle
for
developing
ineffective
assistance
claims?
was
that
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
have
--
mr.
oldham,
if
the
information
is
correct,
that
direct
appeal
counsel
in
the
county
involved
here
gets
a
very
limited
amount
of
money
--
gets,
it
said,
i
think
it's
$1,500
fixed
fee.
but
if
counsel
who's
appointed
as
collateral
review
gets
$25,000,
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
counsel
on
direct
appeal
is
expected
to
deal
with
trial
errors,
and
the
one
that
gets
all
this
$25,000
can
go
out
and
find
a
psychologist,
a
sociologist,
whoever
is
going
to
give
us
a
profile
on
this
person?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
true
that
it's
the
county
that
reimburses
the
direct
appeal
counsel,
and
the
state
reimburses
the
habeas
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
there
ever
been
such
a
case,
any
case
in
which
a
direct
appeal
counsel
has
been
found
ineffective
for
failing
to
present
a
wiggins
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
asked
if
there
was
any
decisions
that
said
you
should
have
raised
it
on
appeal.
appeals
counsel
didn't,
relying
on
the
advice
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
and
therefore,
the
cross-counsel
followed
the
advice
of
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
she
was
ineffective?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
addition
to
saying
as
a
general
rule
bring
it
up
on
collateral
review,
said
--
and
there's
a
reason.
the
reason
why
is
the
undeveloped
record
on
direct
appeal
would
be
insufficient
to
establish
claims
that
must
be
supported
by
extra-record
elements.
that
seems
to
be
an
expectation
that
extra-record
evidence
will
be
developed
on
collateral
review,
not
direct
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
position
of
the
state
that
says
martinez
is
relatively
new,
if
there
is
an
extension
of
martinez
to
cover
this
case,
then
at
least
give
the
texas
courts
the
first
crack
at
deciding
whether
there
was
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
instead
of
having
that
done
in
the
federal
court?
