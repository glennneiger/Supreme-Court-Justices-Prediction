justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he
can
do
this
--
i
didn't
understand
this,
i'm
sorry.
joe
smith
is
convicted
on
day
1.
the
transcript
appears
9
months
later.
okay?
9
months
later
his
new
lawyer,
who
is
supposed
to
proceed
on
appeal,
reads
the
transcript.
he
thinks:
hmm,
i
think
there
was
a
problem
with
his
lawyer
at
the
trial
and
i
would
like
to
raise
this
claim
and
get
a
new
trial.
and
you
are
saying
what
he
does
is
he
goes
back
to
the
trial
court
and
he
says,
judge,
i
just
read
this,
it
raises
some
factual
matters;
will
you
please
give
me
an
evidentiary
hearing
with
the
old
lawyer
there
and
me
there,
so
we
can
develop
this.
now,
that
is
what
--
how
texas
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
i
did
not
get
that
impression
from
the
state
bar
brief,
but
you
are
saying
that
is
how
it
works?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
what
do
you
say?
you
say,
court
of
appeals,
will
you
please
direct
the
trial
court
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
on
the
adequacy
of
trial
counsel
before
you
hear
the
appeal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
yes
or
no?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
you
are
just
saying
that
they
are
all
wrong
about
how
texas
works.
so
i
guess
you
could
refer
to
a
case
where
that
happens.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
what
case
did
that
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
cooks
vs.
state.
and
they
got
the
transcript
months
later
and
they
looked
bag
and
they
said,
oh,
dear,
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
trial
performance.
so
we
go
to
the
federal
appeals
--
the
state
appeals
court
and
you
say,
state
appeals
court,
please
direct
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
they
directed
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
they
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
trial
judge
--
really
what
would
have
happened
on
state
habeas.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
i
am
puzzled
about
what
i'm
supposed
to
do,
because
i
would
have
thought
that
the
standard's
fairly
easy,
that
this
individual
must
always
have
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
present
his
claim
of
inadequate
assistance
at
trial.
there
are
certain
things
that
could
deprive
him
of
that.
one,
his
lawyer
in
the
habeas
state
could
be
incompetent.
all
these
lawyers
could
be
incompetent.
or,
the
state
at
a
certain
stage
didn't
give
him
enough
proceeding.
all
right?
well,
what
do
i
do
where
people
are
disagreeing
about
how
the
state
procedure
works
as
to
whether
it
was
full
and
fair?
what
do
i
do?
what
is
your
suggestion?
by
the
way,
if
he
doesn't
get
the
full
and
fair,
he
still
has
to
show
to
the
federal
habeas
judge
that
he
has
a
substantial
claim,
that
that
trial
was
not
--
so
what
do
you
suggest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right
now
--
but
i'm
saying
what
i
would
like
you
to
sympathize
with
my
problem.
my
problem
is
i
have
seen
--
i
have
a
bunch
of
briefs.
and
they
seem
to
me
that
what
you
have
just
described
is
a
full
and
fair
procedure
to
develop
all
these
evidentiary
matters
before
the
appeal
even
takes
place.
it
exists
in
texas,
and
therefore
unless
he
could
say
his
lawyer
there
was
incompetent,
he's
out
of
luck.
okay?
the
other
side
seems
to
say,
no,
it
doesn't
exist
in
texas.
and
now,
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
since
i
am
not
an
expert
on
texas
procedure?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
tried
that
once
in
a
case
involving
pennsylvania
and
the
result
was
such
that
i
resolved
never
to
do
it
again.
[laughter]
but
--
but
don't
say
never.
all
right.
so
one
thing
we
got--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
happens
--
imagine
we
have
a
state
supreme
court
and
it
says,
okay,
you
could
raise
this
claim
on
appeal.
we
don't
advise
it.
we
think
--
it's
so
much
easier
to
do
it
in
state
habeas.
please
do
it
in
state
habeas.
it's
not
absolutely
binding,
but
do
it.
okay?
that's
what
they
are
saying.
now,
he
raises
nine
of
his
ten
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claims
in
state
habeas.
and
the
state
habeas
court
says,
no,
you
are
out
on
all
nine,
but
he
never
raised
the
tenth.
now
we
are
in
federal
court
and
the
prisoner
says,
you
know,
that
tenth
claim
is
fabulous.
and
the
judge
says,
it
is
substantial.
and
he
says,
you
know
why
it
wasn't
raised
before?
because
my
counsel
was
incompetent
on
state
habeas,
and
they
didn't
raise
it
on
appeal
because
that's
just
how
people
normally
do
things
in
texas,
they
don't
raise
it
on
appeal.
they
wait
until
state
habeas.
has
that
person
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
raise
this
tenth
claim
in
the
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
are
not
saying
never.
they
are
just
saying
it
works
so
much
better.
what
they
say
is
we
appoint
state
habeas
counsel
at
the
same
time.
it's
easier
to
develop
it.
please.
we
won't
say
never.
we'll
just
say
hardly
ever.
now,
what's
--
what
is
the
--
what
is
your
view
about
whether
that
person
has
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
develop
his
tenth
ineffective
assistance
claim
in
the
state
courts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
even
thinking
about
martinez
at
the
moment
because
i
don't
want
to
get
into
whether
it
is
an
extension
or
just
an
elaboration
or
just
a
situation
covered
but
they
didn't
think
of
it
or
just
a
lot
of
other
things.
i
just
want
to
know,
given
martinez,
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
standard
you
are
advocating?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
in
fact
they
say,
yes,
there
is
a
route,
never
used
but
once,
filled
with
minefields,
very
hard
when
compared
with
the
other
one,
there
you
say,
it
isn't
martinez,
it
is
a
totally
--
it
is
a
new
thing.
because
martinez,
after
all,
had
no
rationale.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
being
sarcastic
there
but
i
don't
mean
to
be.
i
mean,
you
see
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
the
dissent
said
that.
[laughter]
