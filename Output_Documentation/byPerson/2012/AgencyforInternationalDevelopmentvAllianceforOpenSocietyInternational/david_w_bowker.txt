mr.
david
w.
bowker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
do
not
dispute
that
the
spending
clause
gives
the
government
significant
authority
to
fund
the
programs
of
its
choosing
and
to
control
speech
and
conduct
within
those
programs.
the
problem
with
the
policy
requirement
is
that
it
aims
at
grantees,
requiring
that
they
profess
a
personal
belief,
and
refrain
from
certain
private
speech
outside
the
context
of
the
government
program.
in
rust
v.
sullivan,
the
court
held
that
the
government
could
ban
abortion-related
speech
in
the
government's
own
family
planning
program,
but
the
grantees
there
were
left
unfettered
in
their
personal
beliefs
and
in
their
private
speech
outside
the
program.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
well,
i
think
the
policy
requirement
here
has
been
applied
a
little
differently
than
mr.
chief
justice
suggests.
it
--
it
is
applied
in
a
way
that
is
a
funding
condition,
not
part
of
the
selection
criteria.
when
the
government
goes
out
to
select
its
partners
in
this
case,
it
--
it
goes
out
with
requests
for
applications,
and
those
requests
for
applications
pertain
to
the
particular
program
at
issue.
and
they
are
very
detailed
about
what
precisely
is
required
for
that
program,
including--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--no.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
right.
i
--
i
think
the
government
absolutely
can
pick
partners
who
are
dedicated
to
the
particular
program
for
which
they
are
applying,
but
there
are
constitutionally
permissible
ways
to
do
that.
one
of
the
ways
to
do
that
is
to
look
at
technical
capacity,
past
performance,
references:
what
have
you
done
before
that
shows
you're
able
to
do
this
particular
program?
mr.
david
w.
bowker
yes.
and
--
and
the
reason
it's
bad
is
because
the
government
there
is
focused
on
viewpoint
and
not
on
ability
to
perform
the
program.
the
problem
--
the
problem
with
focusing--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--well--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--the
--
the
congress
can
certainly
fund
a
particular
program
and
not
fund
others.
and
we
have
no
--
we
have
no
argument
with
that.
the
spending
condition
--
the
spending
clause
definitely
comes
with
that
ancillary
power.
and
in
fact
that's
what
the
congress
did
here.
it
said,
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
fund
a
fight
against
hiv/aids.
we
don't
want
to
support
that
disease.
and
we
want
to
oppose
prostitution.
we
don't
want
to
support
that
practice.
what
it
cannot
do,
then,
is
take
its
viewpoint
and
impose
its
viewpoint
on
the
grantee
and
make
it
a
--
make
it
a
condition.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
well,
i
don't--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--if
--
if
congress
is
looking
at
the
viewpoint
of
an
organization
and
deciding
whether
to
fund
it
based
on
its
viewpoint,
i
think
that's
problematic.
and
the
reason
i
think
it's
problematic
is
because
this
court
has
said
to
deny
a
subsidy
or
a
benefit
on
the
basis
of
the
exercise
of
one's
first
amendment
rights,
including
holding
one's
own
views,
to
deny
a
subsidy
on
that
ground--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--is
problematic.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
not
at
all.
i
think--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--well,
this
court
has
never
said
that
the
congress
can
make
a
decision
based
on
viewpoint
alone.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
sure.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
congress
can
--
can
certainly
decide
what
programs
to
fund
and
what
programs
not
to
fund.
but
when
congress
makes
that
decision,
congress
then
can't
take
the
next
step
to
say
the
only
people
who
can
get
funds
under
this
particular
program
are
people
who
agree
with
us
and
who
will
refrain
from
saying
anything
inconsistent
in
their
private
speech.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
the
court
has
never
said
that's
okay,
and
it's
our
--
and
it's
our--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--it's
our
position
that
it
is
constitutionally
problematic
to
make
funding
decisions
based
on
the
viewpoint
of
grantees.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
unconstitutional
as
applied
here.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
however
--
however,
we
are
not
saying
that
there
is
no
circumstance
in
which
the
government's
interest
wouldn't
be
compelling
enough
to
override
the
first
amendment
right.
now,
in
our
situation--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--i
think
the
rules
are
different
when
the
government
hires
a
spokesperson.
when
the
government
hires
a
spokesperson,
the
government
has
the
right
under
the
--
under
its
ancillary
power
under
the
spending
clause
to
control
what
that
spokesperson
says
for
the
government.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
well,
the
--
the
government
does
say
that.
the
government
says,
what
we
need
to
prevent
is
the
situation
where
the
--
the
government
spokesperson
says
one
thing
with
public
funds,
turns
right
around
and
says
the
opposite
with
private
funds.
and
what
we
say
is
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge.
we
have
--
the
government
concedes
my
clients
have
not
been
enlisted
as
government
spokespersons
and
they
are
not
responsible
for
conveying
any
viewpoint
or
any
message.
and
i'd
like
to
talk
for
a
moment
about
what
my
clients
really
do.
in
the
field,
my
clients
provide
services
in
the
fight
against
hiv/aids,
things
such
as
preventing
mother-to-child
transmission
of
hiv
in
tanzania,
caring
for
orphans
of
aids
victims
in
kenya,
and
providing
hiv/aids
support
services
in
places
like
vietnam.
and
--
and
this
is
a
ja88
and
89,
where
you
can
see
the
list
of
things
that
my
clients
do.
none
of
those
things
relate
to
an
opposition
to
prostitution
and
none
of
those
things
relates
to
messaging.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
certainly,
that
would
be
okay
within
the
four
corners
of
the
government
program.
the
government
controls
speech
and
conduct
within
its
program.
it
can
tell
us
what
not
to
say
within
the
program.
and
that's
rust.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
and
that's
rust.
and
what--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--and
what
rust
says,
and
i
--
i
think
we
fall
back
on
rust,
which
we
think
is
just
on
all
fours
with
where
we
are
here,
and
that
is
what
the
government
cannot
do
--
and
i
think
this
answers
your
question
--
is
outside
the
government
program
the
government
cannot
control
private
speech.
and
it
was
critical
in
that
case
--
justice
rehnquist,
at
pages
196
and
197,
said,
"the
doctors
there
and
the
public
health
organizations
there
are
free
to
engage
in
their
own
private
speech
and
their
own
activities,
and
they
are
not
required
to
endorse
any
viewpoint
they
don't,
in
fact,
hold.
"
and
here--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--rust
does
not
say
that,
to
be
clear.
but
the
reasoning
of
rust,
and
the
majority's
reasoning
there,
makes
quite
clear
that
the
reason
the
court
was
comfortable
there
is
that
the
recipient
was
not
the
target
of
the
control.
the
control
was
around
the
program
and
the
recipient
was
free
outside
the
program.
and
--
and
respondents
here
have
respected
that
line.
there
is
no
question
that
for
the
past
10
years,
even
though
the
policy
requirement
has
not
been
enforced
--
initially
because
the
department
of
justice
concluded
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
and
then
subsequently
because
the
district
court
enjoined
it
--
it
has
not
been
enforced
for
the
last
decade,
essentially.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
and
there's
no
evidence
of
harm
at
all
here,
so
there's
none
of
this
undercutting
the
program
that
the
government
is
alleging
here.
sorry,
justice.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
yes.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
right.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
that's
not
the
case
here,
but
taking
that
case--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--taking
that
case,
i
think
the
government
can't
do
that.
i
think
the
government
cannot
gag
an
organization's
private
speech
outside
the
program.
now,
even
the
government
says
there
has
to
be
some
germaneness
between
what
they
are
doing
in
the
program
and
what
our
requirement
is.
so
i
do
think
it
would
be
a
tougher
case
for
us
and
a
stronger
case
for
the
government
if
my
clients
were
engaged
in
a
program
that
opposed
prostitution
--
we're
not,
but
if
we
were
--
and
then
we
went
right
outside
and
said
the
opposite
with
our
private
funds,
i
think
they
would
have
an
easier
time
showing
that
there
is
some
compelling
interest
that
overrides
the
first
amendment
interest.
now,
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
facts,
and
those
are
not
the
facts
here.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
i
don't
think
you
can
in
terms
of
viewpoint
either,
justice
breyer.
i
do
think
that
the
key,
the
key
that
this
court
outlined
in
rust
is
the
government's
authority
to
control
its
program.
and
if
there
is
a
threat
to
its
program
and
the
government
needs
to
take
some
action
in
order
to
protect
its
program,
prevent
the
message
from
being
garbled
or
distorted,
whatever
the
language
is,
then
the
government's
case
is
strongest.
here,
that
is
not
at
all
what
is
happening.
as
i
described,
our
programs
are
not
opposition
to
prostitution
programs.
our
programs
are
hiv
testing.
these
are
mother-to-child
transmission
situations
where
we're
trying
to
stop
the
disease
from
spreading.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
yes.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
no.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
no.
the
government
cannot
target
viewpoint,
and
for
us,
that's
--
that's
a
bright-line
rule.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
mr.
chief
justice,
i
need
your
help
on--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--well,
our
position
here
is
that
viewpoint
is
not
the
basis
on
which
a
decision
can
be
made.
that
is
our
position.
we
think
the
government
has
a
multitude
of
permissible
grounds
on
which
to
make
these
types
of
decisions,
and
they
do
it
every
day
in
every
other
program
where
they
don't
have
this
odd
policy
requirement.
they
do
it
every
day.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
we
absolutely
would
have
a
leg
to
stand
on,
and
let
me
just
explain--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--what
i
attempted
to
concede
before,
and
that
is,
if
--
if
the
government
--
in
that
narrow
case
where
the
government
is
hiring
a
spokesperson,
which
is
what
they've
focused
on,
saying
one
thing
with
public
funds
and
turning
right
around
and
saying
another
with
private
funds,
there
is
no
case
that
says
they
can
gag
the
private
speech
of
that
spokesperson.
but
what
we're
saying
is
it
is
certainly
possible
that
they
would
have
a
stronger
case
in
that
particular
circumstance;
however,
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge,
my
clients
are
not
spokespersons,
they
concede
that.
my
clients
are
not
delivering
a
message
or
any
particular
viewpoint
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
they
concede
that.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
no,
i
don't
think
it
is.
to
the
extent
the
--
the
criteria
used
by
the
congress
are
merely
pretext
to--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--and
says
this
is
the
reason.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
congress
cannot
do
that.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
well,
even
the
government
concedes
that
--
that
they
can't
do
that.
what
they
say
is
that
in
--
it
must
be
germane.
that's
their
limiting
principle.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that's
permissible,
because
all
that
is,
is
penalizing
a
particular
viewpoint
and
withholding
a
subsidy
or
benefit
based
on
viewpoint.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
well,
that
--
i
don't
think
it
can
make
that
decision
based
on
viewpoint.
however--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--i
mean,
the
--
the
reason
that
that
case
is
so
much
tougher
than
this
one
is
because
in
this
one,
they're
not
attempting
to
select
organizations
that
will
do
the
best
job
by
using
the
policy
requirement.
the
policy
requirement
is
being
used
after
the
organization
has
been
selected
to
say,
now
that
you've
been
selected,
we
want
you
to
toe
the
line.
we
want
you
to
profess
your
belief
in
our
viewpoint
and
not
to
say
anything
with
your
private
funds
outside
the
program.
so
it
is
so
far
beyond
this
--
this
weighing
in
a
selection
situation.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
yes,
i
understand.
i
--
i
think
the
government
could
--
if
it
could
make
the
case
that
an
organization
will
be
unable
to
do
this
effectively
because
of
what
it
has
said
in
the
past,
or
what
it
has
done
in
the
past,
or
how
--
how
the
population
associates
--
what
the
population
associates
with
that
organization.
but
here
--
here
--
and
the
government
even
concedes
--
there
would
--
there
has
to
be
some
--
i
think
the
word
was,
it
has
to
be
tightly
tethered
to
the
programmatic
objective.
now,
we
think
that's
--
that's
way
too
easy
to
fulfill;
that
should
not
be
the
standard.
but
that's
what
they
say
the
limiting
principle
is,
is
germaneness,
tightly
tethered.
in
--
in
your
example,
i
think
that
probably
doesn't
even
meet
their
limiting
principle.
but
in
our
case
--
in
our
case,
there
is
no
tethering
at
all.
we
are
out
testing
for
the
disease
by
extracting
blood
and
running
tests.
we're
out
caring
for
orphans.
we
are
out
improving
public
health
services
that
ngos
deliver,
and
they're
saying
now
you
have
to
profess
your
belief
in
our
particular
viewpoint.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
well--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--well,
as
it's
been
applied
to
us,
it's
more
than
just
have
a
policy.
it's
have
a
policy
and
then
tell
us
you
agree
with
our
policy,
and
we
want
to
make
sure
that
you
believe
it
so
we
know
that
you
will
do
a
good
job
in
the
program.
so
the
purpose
here
is
to
police--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--well,
that's
--
that's
precisely
it,
justice
scalia,
is
we
are
required
to
profess
our
allegiance
to
the
government.
mr.
david
w.
bowker
that's
the
profession
that
we're
required
to--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--that's
the
pledge.
as
--
as
the
author
of
--
of
the
provision
called
it,
it
was
the
pledge.
that's
the
pledge
to
the
government.
now--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--the
government
no
doubt
has
a
good
reason
for
putting
it
there.
the
problem
is
the
first
amendment,
and
where
does
that
--
where
does
that
end?
what
is
the
limiting
principle?
if
all
that's
required
here
is
germaneness
and
then
you
give
a
dollar
and
you
own
the
viewpoint
and
you
own
the
private
speech,
where
does
that
end?
what
that
means
is
--
on
the
government's
theory,
the
government
can
give
you
--
can
give
anyone
in
the
country
a
dollar
in
medicare
funds
and
say,
okay,
now
that
you've
taken
a
dollar
of
our
money,
we
want
you
to
profess
your
agreement
with
the
affordable
care
act,
and
we
want
you
to
never
say
anything
inconsistent
with
that
in
your
private
speech.
that
is
--
that
is
wildly
inconsistent
with
the
first
amendment.
that's
exactly
what's
happening
here.
the
only
difference
is
the
subject
of
prostitution.
that's
what
makes
it
less
palatable.
but
for
us--
mr.
david
w.
bowker
--within
the
program,
they
can
tell
us,
if
we
are
speaking
for
them,
what
to
say,
and
--
on
their
behalf,
not
ours.
and
they
can
tell
us
what
not
to
say,
which
is
rust.
they
cannot
command
fealty
to
their
viewpoint
and
they
certainly
cannot
control
our
private
speech
outside
the
program.
now,
to
be
clear,
i
just
want
to
address
one
last
thing
before
my
time
runs.
to
be
clear,
respondents
here
do
not
promote
prostitution
nor
do
they
approve
of
it.
they
merely
want
to
be
free
in
their
own
private
programs
to
operate
those
programs
as
they
see
fit,
consistent
with
public
health
objectives,
and
they
want
to
be
able
to
participate
in
the
policy
conferences.
they
want
to
be
able
to
publish
papers,
and
they
want
to
be
able
to
be
a
part
of
the
discussion
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
right
here
in
the
united
states,
not
in
the
--
in
the
nether
reaches
of
the
world
--
right
here
in
the
united
states.
they
would
like
to
be
free
to
engage
in
this
important
discussion
and
to
be
unfettered
by
a
policy
requirement
that
demands
fealty
to
the
government's
viewpoint.
now,
the
first
amendment
gives
respondents
that
right,
and
--
and
that's
why
we
are
here.
so
unless
the
court
has
further
questions--
