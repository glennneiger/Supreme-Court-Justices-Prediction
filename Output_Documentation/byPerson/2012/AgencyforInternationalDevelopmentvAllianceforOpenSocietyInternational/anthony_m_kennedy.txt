anthony
m.
kennedy
one
--
one
thing
before
your
time
is
up.
i
have
the
same
concerns
that
justice
ginsburg
expressed
about
the
difficulty
of
simply
creating
structures
in
--
in
foreign
countries.
if
--
and
i've
looked
through
all
of
your
cases.
what's
your
closest
case,
your
best
case
for
the
fact
that
you
should
get
extra
deference
because
this
is
the
foreign
affairs
field?
i
mean,
i
think
of
u.s.
v.
curtis
wright.
anything
more
specific
than
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
let
--
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you
this:
suppose
that
you're
a
congressman
or
a
congresswomen
and
you
are
a
constitutional
expert
and
you
take
your
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution
very
seriously.
a
funding
bill
comes
before
you.
you're
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
and
you
decide
that
you're
going
to
fund
a
rather
than
b
because
you
like
their
speech
much
better.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
you
like
their
policies
much
better?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
--
i
see
the
difference.
that
the
--
a
conscientious
congressperson
cannot
--
can,
in
your
view,
say,
i'm
going
to
prefer
organization
a
over
organization
b
because
i
like
their
policies
better--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--across
the
board,
with
reference
to
drugs,
with
reference
to
guns,
with
reference
to
public
health.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
--
let
me
just
ask
--
ask
this
one
more
time.
it
seems
--
because
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
get
into
the
details
of
your
answer,
you
indicate,
oh,
well,
the
government
has
lots
of
other
criteria
it
could
use,
which
seems
to
me
just
an
invitation
to
disguise
what
the
government's
real
motive
is.
suppose
the
government's
interested
in
preventing
and
stopping
the
spread
of
malaria.
and
there's
an
organization
that's
marvelous
at
delivering
the
proper
message
for
this,
but
they
criticize
the
united
states
often.
so
they
choose
an
organization
that's
not
quite
as
good
but
is
quiet
on
these
other
issues.
is
that
permissible
for
the
congress
to
do?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
this
isn't
--
no.
my
concern
was
that
your
position
was
pretext.
here
the
congress
is
right
upfront.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
they
say
the
reason
we're
not
giving
to
organization
a
is
because
it's
always
critical
of
the
united
states;
even
though
its
technical
skills
are
better,
we
prefer
organization
b.
congress
cannot
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
best
case
for
that
proposition
is
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
they
should
if
they're
going
to
--
if
they're
going
to
be
able
to
establish
the
principle
that
allows
them
to
prevail
in
this
case
and
that's
why
i'm
asking.
