justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
--
well,
it
would
on
that
particular
point.
what
should
we
do
--
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
briefs,
the
people
who
work
with
the
prostitutes
to
try
to
prevent
aids
uniformly
tell
us
that
if
you
go
to
those
prostitutes
and
you
try
to
get
them
to
take
steps
to
stop
aids,
it's
very
hard
to
do
if
at
the
same
time
you've
announced
you're
against
all
prostitution.
so
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
condition
imposed
will
interfere
with
the
objective,
and
if
there
is
a
germaneness
requirement
--
and
nobody
says
the
opposite.
i
mean,
i've
noted
nobody
denies
what
they're
saying
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
of
their
work,
so
--
i
don't
think.
at
least,
i
didn't
read
them
all
with
great
care;
maybe
you
can
point
to
somebody
who
does.
but
if
everyone
is
telling
us
that
this
is
counterproductive
and
the
exact
opposite,
then
can
we
say,
well,
it
isn't
germane.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
quite
a
few,
yes.
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that,
and
i
see
you
have
two
sides
to
the
policy
question.
and
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
that
justice
ginsburg
was
speaking
of
is
pretty
relevant.
why?
well,
that
case,
regan
and
league
of
women
voters,
all
seem
quite
comparable.
they
are
trying
to
balance
the
--
the
desire
of
the
government
to
further
a
policy
objective
with
the
undesirability
of
the
government
invading
what
would
otherwise
be
a
constitutional
protected
right
to
speech.
and
the
way
they
have
done
it
is
quite
technical
and
narrow,
but
it
may
be
applicable.
in
both,
what
they
said
was:
don't
worry
about
your
protected
speech
as
much
as
you
are
because
there
is
another
way
you
can
do
it
here.
you
go
through
a
--
an
independent
structured
organization.
and
where
that
wasn't
present,
namely
the
league
of
women
voters,
the
court
struck
it
down.
now
if
that's
the
right
framework,
then
here
i
don't
see
how
you
could
have
an
independently
structured
organization
for
the
reason
that
a
group
that
said
i
am
--
i
am
opposed
completely
to
prostitution,
publicly,
to
get
the
money,
and
then
set
up
a
structure
that
said
the
opposite,
would
be
seen
as
totally
hypocritical.
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
their
message
across.
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
express
in
any
way
what
it
is
they
think
about
the
administration
of
aids
in
the
context
--
anti-aids
in
the
context
of
prostitution.
that's
a
long
question,
but
you
see
where
--
where
i've
ended
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
the
moment,
for
purposes
of
the
question.
so
why
isn't
this
case
more
like
league
of
women
voters
and
less
like
the
other
two?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wasn't
exempting
that
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
main
difference
it
seemed
to
me
is,
assuming
all
of
that
away,
is
that
here
the
separate
structure
does
not
fulfill
the
constitutional
need
simply
because
the
basic
condition
has
to
do
with
express
speech.
because
when
a
says
“
i
believe
in
x
”
and
then
they
set
up
a
separate
structure
--
and
every
one
knows
they
have
set
it
up;
i
mean,
that's
the
point
of
it
--
and
the
structure
says,
“
just
kidding
”,
nobody
believes
them
from
day
one.
and
so
you
can't
do
it
and
if
the
government
has
its
way
and
has
awarded
the
thing
properly,
according
to
your
criteria,
the
part
that
won't
be
believed
is
the
“
just
kidding
”
part.
and
so
the
structure,
separate
structure,
just
doesn't
work
in
terms
of
communicating
their
belief.
and
i
don't
think
that's
true
in
rust,
and
i
don't
think
it's
true
in
regan,
and
i
do
think
it's
true
in
fcc
v.
league
of
women
voters.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
boy,
if
--
if
the
structure
--
the
separate
structure
is
not
really
part
of
a
constitutional
analysis,
then
the
government
could
say,
why
not?
it's
easy
to
find
policy
reasons,
and
really
find
very,
very
decent
and
thoughtful
people
who
agree
with
the
policy
reason,
you
know?
there
--
there
are
people
on
both
sides
of
these
questions,
and
they
come
in
and
they
say,
okay,
we're
giving
money
for
an
anti-abortion
purpose
or
a
pro-abortion
purpose,
you
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
--
and
suddenly
people
can't
say
anything
in
these
areas
in
face
of
such
a
condition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there's
no
way
to
separate
--
with
an
organization
in
the
field
that
does
things,
there
is
no
way,
i
don't
think,
to
separate
what
they
do
from
what
they
say.
congress
has
two
opposite
views
on
this
in
front
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
is
the
view
that
the
way
to
fight
aids
is
consistent
with
and
is
furthered
by
longer
term
efforts
to
abolish
trafficking
in
women,
okay,
prostitution.
all
right.
the
other
view
is
the
better
way
to
do
it
is
to
go
into
the
active
sex
worker
area
and
--
and
not
express
views
on
the
merits
of
what
they
are
doing.
okay?
so
they
have
two
opposite
views,
and
--
and,
moreover,
the
groups
that
do
this
act
on
those
views.
so
why
can't
they
say,
we
prefer
view
a
or
b,
whichever
it
is,
because
that's
what
our
program
is
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
only
because
--
see,
it's
not
--
it's
not,
in
my
opinion,
not
a
viewpoint
matter
if
they're
going
to
fund
a
--
a
group
that
wants
to
end
discrimination
against
women
around
the
world
because
they
think
all
kinds
of
good
things
will
flow
from
that.
the
government
wants
to
fund
it.
of
course
such
a
group
has
a
viewpoint;
that's
why
they're
in
the
business.
so
the
word
isn't
viewpoint.
and
you
started
to
say
something
about
that
there
is
more
than
that
here,
it
has
to
do
with
the
express
nature.
and
then,
in
answering
justice
sotomayor,
you
went
a
little
bit
further
on
that.
and
what
are
the
form
of
words,
if
you
were
me
and
if
i
were
to
decide
in
your
favor,
what
form
of
words
would
you
dictate
to
describe
where
it
is
in
your
opinion
that
the
first
amendment
cuts
in
with
a
preventative
restriction?
how
do
you
describe
it?
i
--
i
don't
think
you
can
in
terms
of
viewpoint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
did
too,
because
i
--
i
didn't
see
the
reason.
i
thought
that
was
--
i
can
think
of
dozens
and
dozens
of
programs
all
over
the
world
that
the
government
supports
in
some
way
or
another,
and
of
course
the
people
in
those
programs
have
a
certain
viewpoint,
and
of
course,
they
don't
hold
the
opposite
viewpoint.
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
be
in
the
program.
so
--
so
that's
why
i
didn't
find
that
useful.
but
now,
i
don't
think
you
can
have
it
both
ways
between
answering
these
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
they're
doing
that,
they
say,
because
we're
part
of
the
belief
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
the
best
way
to
go
about
this,
whether
you
think
so
or
not,
is
to
restrict
the
grants
to
those
people
who
will
oppose
the
long-term
extension
of
prostitution
expressly.
now,
that's
their
view
of
how
to
get
rid
of
aids,
you
say.
might
disagree
with
it,
but
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
think
the
opposite.
so
they're
saying
we're
not
doing
it
for
any
reason
other
than
to
further
our
policy.
