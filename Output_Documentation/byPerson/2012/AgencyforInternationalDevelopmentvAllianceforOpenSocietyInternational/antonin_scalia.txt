say
it
again.
i
didn't
understand
the
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
partnering?
how
does
this
partnering
differ,
partnering
differ
from
just
giving
them
the
money
to
do
the
job?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
--
what
do
you
mean
by
partnering?
you're
saying
they
are
given
money
to
carry
out
a
particular
program.
is
that
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
all
you
mean
by
partnering?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
carry
out
a
particular
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
it
is
a
naked
grant
of
money
to
implement
a
particular
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
call
that
“
partnering
with
the
federal
government
”.
justice
antonin
scalia
terrible
verb,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
isn't
just
able
to
do.
are
--
are
you
saying
that
they
--
they
just
can't
make
it
a
--
a
prior
condition,
but
they
can
select
applicants
on
the
basis
of
which
ones
they
know
agree
with
the
government's
objectives?
you
--
you
have
two
equally
qualified
--
technically,
two
equally
qualified
applicants,
and
the
government
intentionally
picks
the
one
whose
views
on
--
on
prostitution
are
--
are
similar
to
the
government's.
is
--
is
that
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
my
goodness.
they
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
can't
fund
the
boy
scouts
of
america
because
they
like
the
programs
that
the
bsa
has?
they
--
they
have
to
treat
them
equivalently
with
the
muslim
brotherhood?
is
that
really
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
can
take
into
account
the
--
the
principles
and
the
--
and
the
policies
of
--
of
the
organization
that
you're
giving
funding
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
--
you
go
further
than
that.
in
answer
to
my
question,
you
--
you
go
further
than
that,
and
you
say,
moreover,
even
without
making
it
a
condition
precedent
to
getting
the
money,
congress
can
--
the
government
cannot
intentionally
select
those
people
that
it
thinks
are
in
accord
with
its
views.
right?
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
asking
what
the
court
said;
i'm
asking
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
problematic
or
--
or
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
--
can
i
--
can
i
be
sure--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand
what
you've
just
conceded
in
--
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer.
the
government
could
require
as
a
condition
to
come
into
this
program
and
become
a
partner
with
the
united
states,
that
the
recipient
not
have
the
viewpoint
of
favoring
prostitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
said
it's
not
a
viewpoint
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said
to
justice
breyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
him
or
me?
you
have
to
choose.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say,
“
profess
belief
”.
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
that.
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
it
just
says
they
have
to
have
a
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
policy.
which
means
i
suppose
they
have
to
tell
their
employees
don't
do
anything
to
--
to
foster
prostitution.
but
they
don't
have
to
get
up
--
get
up
and
announce
publicly,
we
oppose
prostitution,
do
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
get
all
that
without
making
you
profess
it,
unless
--
unless
you
consider
the
only
profession
to
be
the
assurance
to
the
--
to
your
partner,
the
united
states
government,
that
you
--
that
you
in
fact
oppose
prostitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
tell
the
government.
that's
--
that's
the
only
profession
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
okay.
