we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
12-10,
agency
for
international
development
v.
the
alliance
for
open
society
international.
mr.
srinivasan.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
guess
the
problem
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
different
ways
you
could
carry
out
the
program.
and
let's
say
you
have
an
organization
that
focuses
on
a
particular
--
you
know,
the
administration
of
hospitals
or
whatever
it
is
that's
covered
by
the
program,
and
they
regard
this
issue
as
collateral
to
what
they're
concerned
with.
there
--
there
have
to
be
some
limitations
on
what
type
of
loyalty
oath
you
can
require
them
to
sign,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
if
they--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--all
right.
i
appreciate
that.
what
if
they're
not?
what
if
the
government
has,
in
addition
to
this
policy,
a
strong
policy
in
promoting,
you
know,
recycling,
and
so
they
require
everybody
with
whom
they're
going
to
do
business,
every
grantee,
to
adopt
a
policy
in
favor
of
using
renewable
resources?
any
problem
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bowker?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
see
why
this
is
a
--
you
talk
about
banning
their
speech.
the
government
is
just
picking
out
who
is
an
appropriate
partner
to
--
to
assist
in
this
project.
it
wants
to
go
and
find
people
who,
like
them,
are
opposed
to
prostitution.
and
all
they
want
to
do
is
make
sure
that
you're
opposed
to
prostitution.
it's
like
any
other
sort
of
condition.
you
know,
we
want
to
make
sure
that
you
haven't
been
convicted
of
tax
fraud
over
the
last
10
years,
so
sign
a
certification
that
you
--
you
haven't.
yes,
it's
related
to
speech,
but
the
whole
program
is
about
that.
why
would
they
want
to
sign
up
with
somebody
who
didn't
share
the
objectives
of
the
program?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
it
would
be
a
different
case,
in
your
--
your
view,
as
if
--
when
they
have
those
criteria,
they
have
one
of
them
is,
oh,
by
the
way,
you
must
agree
with
the
objective
of
the
program,
which
is
to
eliminate
to
the
extent
possible
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
just
say
the
government
wants
to
have
an
ad
campaign
to
discourage
people
from
smoking
and
they
are
looking
for
ad
agencies
to
--
to
help
them
with
it.
and
an
ad
agency
comes
in
and
says,
look,
we
are
the
best
ad
agency
there
is;
we
know
exactly
how
to
get
to
the
markets;
we
know
what's
persuasive
and
all
of
that.
and
yet
--
and
then
the
ad
agency
says,
you
know,
come
work
at
our
agency
if
you
smoke;
we
think
smoking
is
okay;
we
have
smoking
breaks;
we
do
all
this.
"the
government
can't
take
that
into
account?
"
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
part
of
what's
going
on
here?
one
of
the
things
we
want
to
do
is
eradicate
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking,
and
we
want
you
to
get
that
message
out,
and
the
one
thing
we're
sure
of
is
if
you're
not
in
--
if
you're
in
favor
or
you're
not
opposed
to
it
because
you
have
other
objectives,
you're
not
going
to
help
get
the
message
out
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
is
saying
this
is
what's
happening
in
rust,
okay?
and
rust
is
okay.
that's
very
different
from
saying
it
has
to
be
that
way
and
if
it's
any
other
way
it's
no
good.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
just
taking
the
limitation
on
the
facts
in
rust
and
saying
that
is
an
absolute
requirement,
which
is
a
misreading
of
the
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
always
choose
me,
too.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
approach,
it
seems
to
me,
is
just
dealing
with
the
breadth
of
the
program.
if
the
program
here
solely
concerned
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking
and
not
other
areas
where
you
say,
look,
we
do
a
great
job
in
these
other
areas,
we
just
don't
get
involved
in
that
area.
but
if
the
sole
program
was
on
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking,
you
--
you
wouldn't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on,
would
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you're
an
organization--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
--
the
government
has
a
program
to
develop
water
resources.
and
let's
say
it's
in
south
africa
before
the
abolition
of
apartheid.
and
there's
a
pro-apartheid
group
and
an
anti-apartheid
group,
and
you're
saying
the
government
can
only
decide
which
one
is
better
at
digging
wells,
and
it
can't
say
we're
going
to
prefer
the
anti-apartheid
group.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
viewpoint
on
apartheid.
it
can't
say,
so,
the
other
one
shows
we've
got
a
better
record,
we
dig
the
wells
quicker.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
goes
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
program.
it's
related
to
it.
the
united
states
doesn't
want
the
company
or
the
organization
that
goes
into
a
village
and
says
we're
going
to
bring
--
you
know,
this
is
from
the
united
states,
we're
bringing
you
fresh
water
and
it's
a
pro-apartheid
group.
that
does
undermine
what
they
are
trying
to
do,
just
as
in
this
case
to
have
the
organization
providing
the
services
that
your
organization
provides
be
identified
as
as
an
organization
that
doesn't
want
to
abolish
prostitution.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
srinivasan,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
srinivasan--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
have
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-10,
united
states
agency
for
international
development
versus
the
alliance
for
open
society
international.
in
2003,
congress
passed
a
united
states
leadership
against
hiv/aids,
tuberculosis,
and
malaria
act.
that
act
set
forth
a
comprehensive
strategy
to
among
other
things
combat
the
spread
of
hiv/aids
around
the
world.
as
part
of
that
strategy,
congress
appropriated
billions
of
dollars
to
fund
efforts
by
nongovernmental
organizations
to
assist
in
the
fight.
the
money,
however,
comes
with
two
related
conditions
first,
no
funds
made
available
by
the
act
may
be
used
to
promote
or
advocate
the
legalization
or
practice
of
prostitution
or
sex
trafficking.
and
second,
no
funds
may
be
used
by
an
organization
that
does
not
have
a
policy
explicitly
opposing
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking.
this
case
concerns
the
second
condition
referred
to
as
the
policy
requirement.
the
respondents
are
grant
recipients
under
the
act
who
object
to
that
requirement.
they
work
with
prostitutes
to
try
to
stop
the
spread
of
aids
and
think
that
it
will
be
hard
to
do
that
effectively
if
the
prostitutes
are
afraid
the
organizations
want
to
take
away
their
livelihood.
the
organizations
claim
that
the
policy
requirement
violates
their
first
amendment
rights
by
compelling
them
to
adopt
a
particular
view
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
now,
if
the
requirement
were
a
direct
regulation,
it
would
of
course
violate
the
first
amendment.
the
government
cannot
tell
you
what
to
believe.
what
makes
this
case
hard
is
that
the
requirement
is
imposed
only
as
a
condition
on
the
receipt
of
federal
funds.
as
the
government
puts
it,
“if
you
do
not
like
the
requirement
that
you
have
a
policy
opposing
prostitution,
don't
take
the
money.”
under
our
cases,
that
answer
is
usually
sufficient
when
it
comes
to
funding
conditions
in
general.
in
some
cases,
however,
we
have
said
that
a
funding
condition
can
give
rise
to
a
first
amendment
violation
that
it's
not
enough
to
say,
“just
don't
take
the
money.”
the
line
that
emerges
from
our
cases
and
it
is
not
a
clear
one
is
between
conditions
that
regulate
how
the
federal
funds
are
to
be
used
in
the
program
and
conditions
that
seek
to
leverage
the
funding
to
regulate
speech
outside
the
program.
so,
where
does
the
policy
requirement
fall?
it
does
not
just
tell
an
organization
how
it
can
use
the
funds.
if
you
remember,
the
first
condition
does
that.
it
says,
“you
can't
use
the
funds
to
promote
legalization
or
the
practice
of
prostitution.”
the
policy
requirement
does
more.
it
tells
an
organization
what
it
must
believe.
it
must
have
a
policy
explicitly
opposing
prostitution.
that
compelled
belief
goes
with
the
organization
wherever
it
goes.
the
organization
cannot
say
it
has
one
belief
when
it
comes
to
the
federal
program
and
the
different
belief
when
it
is
working
on
its
own
time
and
dime.
it
is
the
very
nature
and
purpose
of
the
policy
requirement
that
it
apply
outside
the
confines
of
the
particular
federal
program.
the
government,
therefore,
cannot
insist
that
organizations
adopt
the
anti-prostitution
policy
as
the
price
of
obtaining
leadership
act
funds.
the
government
says,
“organizations
that
receive
funds
under
the
act
should
not
be
allowed
to
undermine
the
government's
policy
opposing
prostitution.”
but
the
policy
requirement
does
not
just
say,
“don't
do
anything
to
undermine
the
government's
policy.”
it
says,
“you
must
adopt
the
government's
policy
as
your
own.”
now
as
to
that,
we
cannot
improve
on
what
was
said
in
this
courtroom,
from
this
bench
70
years
ago
last
friday.
that
was
when
justice
robert
jackson
announced
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
flag
salute
case.
he
said,
“if
there
is
any
fixed
star
in
our
constitutional
constellation,
it
is
that
no
official,
high
or
petty,
can
prescribe
what
shall
be
orthodox
in
politics,
nationalism,
religion,
or
other
matters
of
opinion
or
force
citizens
to
confess
by
word
or
act
their
faith
therein.”
the
judgment
below
has
affirmed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
justice
kagan
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
