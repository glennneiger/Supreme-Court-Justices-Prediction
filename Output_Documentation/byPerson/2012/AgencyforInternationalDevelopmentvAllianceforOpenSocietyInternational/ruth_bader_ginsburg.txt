mr.
srinivasan,
there
isn't
--
at
least
i'm
not
familiar
with
anything
quite
like
this
where
if
you're
not
told,
if
you
want
to
run
a
government
program,
you
have
to
speak
the
government's
speech.
this
doesn't
require
the
recipient
to
speak
to
anybody
at
all,
except
to
the
government
itself,
to
say,
i
pledge
that
my
policy
is
the
government's
policy.
so
it's
making
somebody
adopt
as
her
own
the
government's
policy
rather
than
saying,
i
understand
that
i
get
my
government
money,
i
have
to
follow
the
government's
rules
about
what
i
can
say
to
the
public.
here
--
and
is
--
is
there
anything
else
quite
like
this
where
you
make
a
pledge
to
the
government,
but
with
respect
to
third
parties
doesn't
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
srinivasan,
on
this,
it
does
seem
to
me
unusual,
as
justice
alito
brought
out,
requiring
somebody
to
say
“
i
believe
this
”
or
"i
agree
with
the
government
on
that.
"
the
rust
v.
sullivan,
which
is
one
of
the
precedents
on
which
you
rely,
made
it
a
point
that
the
doctor
was
not
required
to
represent
as
his
own
views,
not
required
to
represent
an
opinion
that
he
doesn't
hold.
he
has
to
adhere
to
the
government's
program
in
his
dealings
with
the
public,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
say
“
i
agree
with
the
government
”.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
just
an
irrelevant
consideration
in
rust,
that
no
one
--
no
one
was
being
obliged
to
say
i
believe
something
that
they
don't
believe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
mr.
srinivasan,
there
is
a
difference
in
this
international
setting.
most
of
those
separate
affiliates
was
in
taxation
without
representation
and
it
was
the
cure
for
the
legal
of
women
voters.
but
here,
as
the
d.c.
district
court
said
in
its
opinion,
which
was
in
your
favor:
oh,
all
you
have
to
do
is
spin
off
a
subsidiary
that
gets
the
government
money;
it's
just
a
simple
matter
of
corporate
reorganization.
but
you
know
that
getting
an
ngo,
a
new
ngo,
recognized
in
dozens
of
foreign
countries
is
no
simple
thing
to
accomplish.
i
mean,
to
take
a
concrete
example,
look
what
happened
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
in
egypt
when
the
u.s.
ngo's
were
indicted
for
criminal
--
for
not
complying
with
the
permit
requirements
of
the
country.
so
it's
one
thing
to
set
up
a
501(c)(3)
and
501(c)(4)
operating
in
the
united
states,
each
does
its
thing.
but
to
require
an
ngo
to
then
in
the
countries
where
it's
operating
get
the
necessary
permits
is
quite
an
arduous
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
--
what
--
are
you
saying
that
you
can
--
within
the
government
program,
within
the
government
program,
the
government
can
specify
whatever
it
wants,
including
this
--
this
policy,
but
it
can't
then
say
and
the
organization
outside
the
program
is
also
bound
by
this
profession?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
srinivasan,
that
was
one,
veterans.
everybody
else
was
subject
to
the
lobbying
restriction.
here
it's
20
percent
of
the
funds
go
to
the
organizations
that
are
free
from
this
pledge.
