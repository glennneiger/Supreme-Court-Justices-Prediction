mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress's
comprehensive
program
to
address
the
worldwide
problem
of
hiv
and
aids
includes
a
policy
of
opposing
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking
because
they
contribute
to
the
diseases
spread.
and
correspondingly,
congress
determined
--
determined
that
the
government
should
partner
with
and
should
grant
limited
competitive
federal
funding
to
those
organizations
that
agree
with
the
policy
opposing
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking,
because
organizations
that
agree
with
that
policy
are
most
likely
to
carry
out
the
federal
program
in
conformity
with
the
federal
policy
priorities.
now,
no
organization
that
carries
out
hiv
programming
is
required
to
subscribe
to
the
federal
government's
views,
but
if
an
organization
wants
to
partner
with
the
federal
government
and
get
federal
funds
to
carry
out
the
federal
program,
well,
that
organization--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
way
that
congress
looked
at
this
was
to
look
at
--
at
the
organizations
with
which
the
government
is
going
to
partner
across
the
mine
run
of
situations.
and
i
think
what
one
can
do
is
look
at
respondents'
brief,
because
respondents
encompass
a
variety
of
different
types
of
organizations.
but
respondents'
brief
itself
tells
you,
at
pages
11
to
12
and
at
pages
32
and
33,
that
there
are
going
to
be
situations,
in
their
own
experience,
in
which
these
issues
about
prostitution
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--and
sex
trafficking
come
into
issue.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
would
present
a
different
question.
of
course,
you
know
that
it
presents
a
different
question,
but
it
would
be
a
little
bit
more
difficult
for
the
--
for
the
following
reason:
that
there
is
a
germaneness
component
to
congress's
--
the
constitutionality
of
congress's
funding
decisions
in
this
area.
and
the
more
sweeping
and
the
less
germane
the
condition
would
be,
the
more
it's
open
to
constitutional
attack.
now,
this
condition
is
very,
very
germane,
because
as
--
because
as
congress
found,
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking
contribute
to
the
spread
of
the
disease.
and
so
it
makes
good
sense
that
congress
would
have
imposed
this
condition.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
understand--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
think
so,
and
two
responses
on
that
score.
first
of
all,
everybody
is
not
telling
you
that,
and
i'll
tell
you
who's
not
telling
you
that
in
a
second.
but
the
more
--
but
the
overarching
point
is
that
this
is
a
policy
determination
that
congress,
of
course,
took
into
account
when
it
fashioned
the
statute,
and
it
concluded
that
it
was
important
to
have
an
opposition
to
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking.
now,
as
far
as
the
organizations
that
aren't
telling
you
that,
there
is
an
amicus
brief
that's
filed
by
46
organizations
that
it's
in
our
support--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--that's
in
our
support,
and
the
lead
organization
is
the
coalition
against
trafficking
in
women,
and
they
--
they
support
us.
and
they
think
that
the
best
way
--
and
they
--
and
they
argued
this
passionately
in
their
brief
--
they
think
that
the
best
way
to
provide
services
to
the
target
audience
is
under
a
rubric
of
opposition
to
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking.
and
i
would
urge
you
to
take
a
look
at
that
brief,
because
it
explains
why
the
program
should
be
conducted
in
this
fashion.
now,
is
there
a
debate
about--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--justice
ginsburg,
if
i
could
just
fight
the
premise
of
your
question
just
very
slightly
and
then
explain
why
i
think
this
kind
of
requirement
makes
sense
in
this
particular
context.
the
goal
of
this
is
not
to
persuade
somebody
to
change
their
view.
the
goal
of
this
is
to
partner
with
organizations
that
self-identify
as
organizations
that
agree
with
the
government's
policy
priorities.
and
the
reason
the
government
has
done
that,
and
the
reason
why
congress
could
--
felt
that
that
was
a
good
idea
is
straightforward,
and
that
is
that
those
organizations
that
agree
with
congress's
policy
priorities
are
going
to
be
more
likely
to
be
reliable
and
effective
partners
in
carrying
out
the
government's
program.
and
one
way
to
think
about
it
is
to
envision
this:
you
have
a
circumstance
in
which
you're
down
to
your
last
few
dollars
of
a
discretionary
federal
funding
and
you're
looking
at
two
different
organizations
that
are
competing
for
that
money.
one
of
them
comes
to
you
and
says,
we
agree
with
your
policy
of
an
opposition
to
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking,
and
the
other
one
says,
we're
not
going
to
tell
you
whether
we
agree;
we're
going
to
remain
studiously
neutral.
but
we'll
tell
you
that
we'll
conduct
our
affairs
in
a
manner
that's
not
inconsistent
with
your
policy
priorities.
i
think
it
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world
for
congress
to
decide
that
the
government
should
preferably
partner
with
the
former
organization
rather
than
the
latter,
because
they're
going
to
be
more
reliable
and
more
effective
at
carrying
out
the
government's
program.
and
there's
another
aspect
of
this
that
i
think
that
is
important
to
highlight,
and
that
is
that
we're
not
just
talking
about
circumstances
in
which
the
conduct
is
--
is
arguably
going
to
be
neutral,
so
that
there's
going
to
be
no
position
taken.
there's
also
going
to
be
occasions
in
which
the
organizations
that
are
providing
services
are
going
to
have
the
opportunity
to
affirmatively
embrace
the
government's
policy
in
opposition
to
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
there
--
there
is
germaneness,
justice
alito,
and
i
can
point
to
a
couple
of
other
limiting
principles
that
have
been
noted
in
this
court's
decisions
and
i
think
that
are
satisfied
here.
one
is
that
finley
talked
about,
and
i
think
it
captures
some
other
decisions
in
this
--
this
respect,
disallowing
the
government
from
leveraging
its
control
over
funding
conditions
in
a
manner
that
services
a
speech-suppressive
objective.
and
so
you
have
to
be
careful,
and
i
think
this
maps--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it
--
it
--
the
government
is
limited
from
leveraging
its
control
over
funding
conditions
so
that
it
can
achieve
a
speech
--
speech-suppressive
objective.
and
i
think
what
the
court
was
getting
at
is
that
you
want
to
be
careful
that
the
speech
condition,
the
speech-related
condition,
is
tightly
tethered
to
the
programmatic
objective
and
not
allow
the
government
to
--
to
have
the
program
seep
into
other
areas
where
it
doesn't
have
to
go.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
with
--
with
certain
limitations.
i
mean,
i
think
germaneness
is
a
--
is
a
criterion.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
well,
i
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i'm
not
sure,
justice
alito,
and
of
course
it's
going
to
be
hard
for
me
to
decide
that
we
are
not
going
to
defend
something.
but
let
me
just
give
you
a
limiting
idea
that's
out
there,
which
is
that
i
think
there
is
an
important
distinction
between
circumstances
in
which
the
government
is
partnering
with
an
organization
to
carry
out
a
government
program,
and
circumstances
in
which
the
government
is
extending
a
federal
subsidy
to
an
individual
organization
as
kind
of
an
across-the-board
entitlement.
so
in
the
generally
applicable
across-the-board--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it
the
differs
from
giving
the
money
to
do
the
job.
i
guess
what
i'm
saying
is
there
are
going
to
be
circumstances,
for
example,
like
in
speiser,
where
the
financial
question
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
expenditure
of
the
money
by
the
recipient
in
a
manner
that's
commensurate
with
congressional
goals.
in
that
context
you're
giving
a
generally
applicable
entitlement,
and
you're
not
so
worried
about
how
the
money
is
being
spent
because
that
person
is
not
partnering
with
the
government
in
carrying
out
a
federal
program.
here
the
organizations
are
partnering
with
the
government
in
carrying
out
the
federal
program,
because
it's
the
federal
hiv
program
that's--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--yes.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
they
are
given
money
to
carry
out--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--but
in
concert
with
federal
policy
priorities.
so
it's
not
just
--
it's
not
just
a
naked
grant
of
money.
if
you
had
an
entitlement,
justice
scalia,
for
example,
let's
just
consider
your
classic
entitlement--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--to
implement
a
particular
program
and--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
do.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
okay.
my
apologies
for
that,
for
associating
with
the
organization
recipient
in
carrying
out
a
federal
program.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
yes.
that's
true,
justice
ginsburg.
but
here's
why--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
here's
why
i
think
it
makes
sense
in
this
context.
it
is
distinct
in
that
respect,
but
here's
why
i
think
it
makes
sense
in
this
specific
context.
what
congress
wanted
to
do
is
secure
an
ex
ante
commitment
from
the
organizations
with
which
the
government
works
to
assure
that
they
agreed
with
the
government's
policy
priorities.
now,
where
these
programs
are
carried
out
is
in
the
main
in
foreign
territory,
in
distant
lands,
and
in
that
context
i
think
congress
would
have
understood
that
monitoring
of
conduct
can
be
particularly
challenging.
and
that
monitoring
is
made
all
the
more
challenging
because
these
issues
can
come
into
play
through
a
myriad
of
interactions
between
the
organizations
that
are
working
with
the
government
and
local
communities
and
local
officials.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
think
i
do.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
for
the
following
reasons,
justice
breyer:
there
is
an
alternative
affiliated
organizational
vehicle
in
this
case
as
well,
and
i
think
that's
constitutionally
significant.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
quibble
with
your
honor's
point
about
how
the
organization
that's
the
funding
recipient
has
made
this
policy
agreement
and
that
that
can
have
ripple
effects,
but
here's
why
that
matters.
the
point
of
having
an
alternate
vehicle
is
not
that
it
remedies
a
constitutional
problem
that
already
exists.
the
point
of
it
is
to
get
to
this
leveraging
purpose
that
i
was
talking
about
earlier,
and
it's
to
show
that
what
the
government
is
doing
is
keeping
the
condition
within
its
appropriate
confines,
and
it's
not
allowing
that
condition
to
spread
beyond
that
into
other
realms.
and
that
purpose
is
fully
served
by
the
organizational
affiliate
alternative
here.
and
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
guess
it
depends
on
which
direction
it
runs
as
a
principal
point.
i
mean,
of
course,
the
recipient
organization
that's
been
conducting
the
program
to
date
can
continue
to
conduct
the
program
and
the
affiliate
that's
set
up
could
be
the
alternate
channel.
and
so
you
could
run
in
the
opposite
direction
and
i
think
you
wouldn't
run
into
that
problem.
but
i
would
like
to
address
on
this
score
an
important
point,
which
is
that
i
think
respondents
have
suggested
that
there
is
a
material
distinction
between,
justice
breyer,
the
circumstances
in
rust
and
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
because
rust
involves
separate
programs
within
a
legal
entity,
and
this
case
involves
separate
organizations.
and
i
think
the
point
the
respondents
are
trying
to
make
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
because
at
least
there
one
legal
entity
could
have
multiple
programs,
some
of
which
are
subject
to
the
condition
and
some
of
which
are
not,
whereas
here
there
is
a
difference
because
this
condition
applies
to
an
entire
organization.
but
i
think
that's
a
false
premise.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
okay.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
i
guess
i'd
--
i'd
make
two
points,
justice
breyer.
one
is,
as
i
was
suggesting
earlier,
the
purpose
of
having
this
alternate
channel
is
not
to
remedy
a
constitutional
violation
that
otherwise
would
exist.
i
mean,
of
course,
we
start
from
the
premise
that
it's
okay
to
require
this
condition
at
the
front
end.
it's
not
that
it's
unconstitutional,
and
the
way
to
compensate
for
that
is
to
create
this
affiliate
alternative.
we
think
the
condition's
okay
ab
initio.
what
the
alternate
vehicle
does
is
to
address
this
other
problem,
that
it
shows
that
the
condition
is
appropriately
tailored.
it's
not
reaching
beyond
its
appropriate
confines,
because
it's
allowing--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--well,
as
part
of
the
--
as
part
of
the
constitutional
analysis,
i
guess
it's
just
addressing
a
different
part
of
the
constitutional
analysis
than
--
than
what
your
--
your
honor
is
addressing.
i
guess
the
other
points
that
i'd
make
are
twofold.
one
is
that
i
think
there
is
something
to
the
notion
that
if
the
organizations
are
sufficiently
separate,
then
--
as
they
have
to
be
to
comply
with
the
regulations
--
then
it
does
work
that
one
organization
can
say
that
we
have
a
particular
policy,
and
the
organization
--
another
organization
--
another
organization
can
say
that
we
have
a
different
policy,
precisely
because
of
the
premise
that
they're
sufficiently
distinct.
so
i'm
not
seeing
the
same
degree
of
cognitive
dissonance
you
are--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--and
the
other
point
i'd
make--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--thank
you,
justice
sotomayor.
the
other
point
i'd
make
is
this,
that
the
speech-related
objections
that
respondents
levy
are
twofold.
one
is,
they
complain
about
the
threshold
condition.
but
the
second
is
--
and
this
is
--
may
--
manifests
at
pages
11
to
12
and
32
and
33
of
their
brief
--
is
that
they
want
to
engage
in
activities
that
involve
affirmative
speech.
they
want
to
be
able
to
participate
in
the
dialogue
about
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking
and
whether
they
should
be
legalized.
and
with
respect
to
that
aspect
of
what
respondents
are
complaining
--
complaining
about,
i
think
the
alternate
affiliated
organization
opportunity
is
a
perfect
remedy,
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
in
rust,
and
in
the
same
way
that
it
--
that
it
was
in
regan.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
--
i'd
certainly
understand
why
a
church
would
be
reluctant
to
do
that.
i
mean,
i
guess,
you
know,
one
way
to
look
at
it
is
that
the
city
i
think
would
have
to
think
very
long
and
hard
about
whether
that's
a
--
a
desirable
policy
objective,
precisely
because
some
of
the
organizations
with
which
it
wants
to
work
are
going
to
have
difficulty
abiding
by
it.
and
so
there's
going
to
have
to
be
a
front
end
determination
as
a
matter
of
policy
about
whether
that's
an
appropriate
thing
to
pursue.
but
if
the
city,
as
congress
did
in
this
case,
thought
that
it
was
an
appropriate
thing
to
do,
then
i
think
i
would
--
i
think
i
would
defend
that
--
apart
from,
you
know,
free
exercise
issues
of
other
things
that
aren't
in
play
here
--
i
think
i
would
defend
it
as
long
as
it's
sufficiently
germane,
and
as
long
as
it's
in
furtherance
of
the
policy
objectives
that
congress
or
by,
in
your
hypothetical,
the
city--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
know
that
it
would,
justice
alito,
on
that--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--because
--
because
i
think,
first
of
all,
it
would
depend
on
whether
there
--
there
is
the
requisite
germaneness.
it
would
depend
on
whether
in
fact
the
organizations
are
working
with
--
i'm
trying
to
avoid
using
the
word
“
partnering
with
”
--
but
are
working
with
the
--
the
government
in
carrying
out
the
program.
it
would
depend
on
those
kinds
of
considerations.
and
whether
--
another
point
to
be
made
here
is
that
a
limitation
that's
been
recognized
in
this
court's
cases
is
that
at
the
end
of
the
day,
the
government
--
the
government
can't
be
seeking
to
suppress
speech,
or
to
suppress
disfavored
viewpoints,
even
in
the
context
of
subsidization.
and
you'd
have
to
ask
the
question
whether
that
scheme
is
designed
to
do
that.
now,
if
--
if
it
crossed
all
those
thresholds,
then
i
think
yes,
i
would
defend
that
as
well,
but
i
do
think
that
it
presents
different
and
more
difficult
questions.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
know
that
i
have
a
particular
case
other
than
the
doctrine
generally,
justice
kennedy.
but
i
do
think
that
the
foreign
location
of
this
is
significant
vis-a-vis
the
concern
that
i
think
many
of
you
have
raised
about
why
have
an
affirmative
condition
that
requires
espousal
of
a
policy.
precisely
because
the
conduct
here
is
carried
out
in
foreign
areas,
and
precisely
because
it
can
involve
myriad
interactions
with
local
officials
and
local
policymakers,
as
respondents
admittedly
want
to
do,
on
these
sensitive
questions,
it
makes
sense
in
this
context
--
particular
sense
in
this
context
to
secure
an
ex
ante
commitment
of
agreement
with
the
government's
policy,
because
that
will
have
a
self-policing
aspect
to
it.
it
will
be
more
designed
to
secure
conduct
in
those
areas
that,
in
conformity
with
federal
policy,
in
a
realm
in
which
that
conduct
is
particularly
--
particularly
difficult
to
monitor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
might.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
--
a
few
points
in
rebuttal.
first,
by
--
by
way
of
characterizing
this
requirement,
i
think
there
has
been
a
suggestion
made
that
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
impose
a
viewpoint
on
organizations.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
imposing
a
viewpoint
on
somebody.
it's
a
matter
of
picking
organizations
with
which
to
work
who
self-identify
as
having
views
that
are
commensurate
with
the
government's
views,
so
that
they
will
be
reliable
in
carrying
out
the
government's
program.
now,
justice
kennedy,
you'd
asked
about
why
--
whether
the
foreign
context
of
the
case--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--because
it
goes
to
the
limitation
that
the
court
has
imposed
in
its
decisions
about
leveraging
funding
so
as
to
suppress
viewpoints.
that's
not
what's
going
on
here.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
funding
is
being
leveraged
to
suppress
a
viewpoint.
it's
a
case
in
which
we
are
trying
to
get
an
ex
ante
determination
of
whether
the
organizations
that
are
going
to
carry
out
the
federal
program
agree
with
our
policies.
if
they
do,
they
can
participate--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--i
don't
think--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--it's
not
--
justice
alito,
with
all
respect,
i
don't
think
it's
trying
to
change
their
viewpoint.
i
think
if
they
decide
later
on
that
they
would
affirm
to
us
that
they
agree
with
the
policy
at
that
point
in
time,
well,
we
may
--
we
may
take
that
observation
and
engage
them.
but
i
don't
think
that
effort
is
to
try
to
change
their
viewpoint.
it's
to
try
to
get
them
to
self
--
self-identify
that
they
are
going
to
be
reliable
in
carrying
out
the
government
program.
justice
kennedy,
you'd
asked
the
question
about
whether
the
foreign
context
matters,
and
i
talked
about
why
it
matters
in
the
sense
that
monitoring
can
be
challenging
in
this
context.
it
also
matters
in
another
sense
that
i
should
add,
which
is
that
when
the
organizations
are
doing
this
work
in
those
areas,
they
are
identified
as
working
with
the
united
states
government.
there
is
a
statutory
provision
at
291(a)
of
the
petition
appendix,
which
is
22
u.s.c.
7611(h),
and
that
requires
the
global
aids
coordinator
to
develop
a
message
that
enhances
awareness
by
program
recipients
that
the
program
is
an
effort
on
behalf
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states.
so
there
is
a
real
perception
out
there
that
when
the
organization
is
carrying
out
its
functions,
it's
doing
so
at
the
behest
of
the
united
states
citizens.
and
part
of
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
avoid
a
misimpression
about
why
--
about
what
the
united
states'
policy
priorities
are.
and
one
way
to
do
that
is
to
assure
that
the
organizations
with
which
the
united
states
works
share
the
united
states'
policy
commitment
against
prostitution
and
sex
trafficking.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
sotomayor,
congress
is
not
required
to
--
to
pursue
every
objective
no
matter
what
the
cost
may
be.
the
court
confronted
a
similar
situation
in
regan.
that
case
involved
an
exemption
for
veterans.
the
court
applied
a
rationality
standard
and
said
--
said
that
was
fine.
and
there's
certainly
a
rationale
here.
mr.
sri
srinivasan
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
the
exemption
for
these
organizations
makes
good
sense
if
you
consider
the
character
of
the
organizations.
three
of
the
four
are
--
have
members
that
are
sovereign
entities.
and
so
one
can
understand--
mr.
sri
srinivasan
--can
i
just
finish
this
thought?
one
can
understand
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
tread
with
sensitivity
when
--
when
we
are
dealing
with
foreign
countries,
especially
foreign
countries
that
have
different
views
about
prostitution.
and
there's
less
of
a
danger
--
and
this
is
the
final
point
--
there's
less
of
a
danger
in
that
context
that
those
entities'
views
are
going
to
be
misattributed
to
the
united
states
precisely
because
they
are
foreign
countries.
