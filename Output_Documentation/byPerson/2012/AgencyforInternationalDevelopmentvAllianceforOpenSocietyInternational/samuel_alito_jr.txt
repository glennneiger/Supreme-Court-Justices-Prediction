justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
permissible
for
congress
to
condition
federal
funding
on
the
recipient's
expression
of
agreement
with
ideas
with
which
the
recipient
disagrees.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
that
kind
of
compelled
speech
has
been
permitted.
and
i
would
be
interested
in
--
and
it
seems
to
me
like
quite
a
--
a
dangerous
proposition.
i
would
be
interested
in
whatever
limitations
you
think
there
might
be
on
that
rule,
which
seems
to
be
the
general
rule
that
you're
advocating.
other
than
the
requirement
of
germaneness,
is
there
anything
else.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
this
example,
which
is
mentioned
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
the
government
provides
lots
of
funding
to
universities
to
--
in
various
forms,
either
directly
or
through
student
loans,
in
the
form
of
tax
exemptions,
so
anything
that
would
be
germane
to
the
general
purpose
of
higher
education
presumably
could
be
attached
as
a
condition
to
those
funds.
would
that
be
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
with
what
--
with
what
limitations?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
government
could
have
a
whole
list
of
things,
of
principles
that
it
thinks
should
be
incorporated
into
higher
education,
and
it
could
require
a
university
as
a
condition
of
receiving
these
--
this
money,
let's
say
directed
through
student
loans,
to
express
agreement
with
all
of
these
propositions.
would
that
be
true.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why
don't
i
give
you
another
example
that's
along
the
same
lines.
the
federal
government
provides
lots
of
funds
to
entities
and
individuals
who
are
involved
in
the
provision
of
health
care.
so
let's
suppose
congress
says
that
we
think
that
the
issue
of
guns
is
very
germane
to
public
health,
and
therefore,
we
will
not
allow
anybody
to
receive
any
of
these
funds
directly
or
indirectly
unless
that
entity
or
person
proclaims
agreement
with
whatever
we
happen
to
think
at
the
moment
about
guns.
so
they
must
either
say
we
believe
that
guns
should
be
strictly
limited
--
access
to
them
should
be
strictly
limited
for
public
health
purposes
or
that
guns
should
be
freely
available
because
we
think
that
promotes
public
health.
that
would
be
permissible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
would
it
not?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
rebuttal,
but
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
those
two,
those
two
things
that
you
just
tried
to
distinguish.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
suppose
you
have
an
organization
that
previously
has
expressed
support
for
the
legalization
of
--
of
prostitution.
then
when
you
tell
them,
well,
if
that's
your
policy
you
can't
get
our
money,
they
say,
well,
we
need
your
money,
so
we're
going
to
have
to
say
uncle
and
now
we
are
opposed
to
the
legalization
of
prostitution.
that
then
--
that
isn't
trying
to
change
people's
viewpoint?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--to
change
the
viewpoint
that
they
are
expressing?
