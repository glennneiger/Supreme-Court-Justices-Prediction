justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
finish
answering
him
and
then
i'll--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
problem
that
i
have
with
that
answer
is
that
it
doesn't
cure
the
organization's
need
to
stay
true
to
its
own
beliefs.
because
if
--
and
i
think
this
is
what
justice
breyer
is
trying
to
get
to
--
if
it
truly
an
independent
organization
speaking,
then
that's
that
organization's
belief;
it's
not
an
alternative
under
rust
to
the
needs
of
that
organization
to
have
its
own
personal
views.
and
--
and
so
i
have
that
problem,
which
is
how
is
it
an
alternative
for
that
organization
to
be
able
to
have
its
views?
let
me
posit
a
hypothetical
that
i'm
actually
very
troubled
by.
let's
assume
a
city
government
is
undertaking
a
campaign
to
prevent
teen
pregnancy
and
its
associated
problems,
and
it
wants
to
promote
the
use
of
contraceptives
that
protect
from
contracting,
you
know,
diseases,
things
like
that.
and
some
of
its
programs
involve
the
distribution
of
contraceptives,
but
others
involve
parenting
classes
for
teenage
mothers
and
offering
them
free
daycare.
and
a
church
seeks
funds
for
the
daycare
part
and
the
parenting
part.
can
the
city
now
say
because
we
have
this
really
important
need
to
avoid
sexually
transmitted
diseases,
anyone
who
seeks
our
funds
also
have
to
say
they
believe
in
the
use
of
contraceptives?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
church
there
would
say,
we
don't
believe
and
why
should
we
say
we
believe.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
that's
my
problem,
which
is
i'm
trying
to
tease
out
what
your
position
is.
okay?
i
--
i
have
an
understanding
of
you're
saying:
you
can't
compel
me
to
say
i
don't
like
something.
and
--
and
that's
like
a
oath
of
loyalty.
that
--
that's
understandable.
but
if
the
government
said
the
following
more
clearly
--
this
is
an
oddly
phrased
policy,
okay,
because
it
seems
to
be
requiring
this
oath.
but
if
it
simply
said,
"if
you're
an
organization
that
wants
our
funds,
you
have
to
say
that
you're
not
going
to
promote
actively
the
contrary
policy.
"
would
that
be
okay?
"you're
not
going
to
go
out
there
and
do
things
to
promote
the
legalization
of
prostitution
because
that's
going
to
undermined
our
message.
"
those
are
two
different
positions,
so
tell
me
where
you
draw
the
line.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes,
that's
rust.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
a
step
further.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no,
no,
no.
i
cut
you
off.
but
--
but
i
guess
what
i'm
--
i
keep
going
back
--
you
keep
going
back
and
forth
on
this
it
--
it's
not
okay
to
tell
me
to
take
an
oath
of
loyalty.
but
would
it
be
okay
for
you
to
step
outside
the
doors
of
this
program
and
pass
out
literature
that
promotes
the
legalization
of
prostitution?
am
i
making
my
question
clear?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
is
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
answer
the
question
of
why
does
the
constitution
bar
the
government
from
saying,
look,
if
you're
going
to
work
with
me,
you
can't
go
out
there
and
promote
a
--
actively
promote--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--a
different
message?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
would
have
less
problem
accepting
your
message
if
there
weren't
four
major
organizations
who
were
exempted
from
the
policy
requirement
and
--
medical
science
--
vaccinators
are
exempted.
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
selection
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
terms
of
who
it
wants
to
work
with.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
really
wanted
to
protect
the
u.s.,
you
wouldn't
exempt
anybody
from
this.
