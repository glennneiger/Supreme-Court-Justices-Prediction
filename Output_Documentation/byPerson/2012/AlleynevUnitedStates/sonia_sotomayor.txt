justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
could
you
address
an
issue
that's
very
important
to
me,
the
one
of
stare
decisis.
and
so,
that
--
hone
in
on
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
problem
is,
whether
you're
right
or
wrong
--
and
you're
absolutely
right,
it
was
a
plurality
opinion
--
your
adversary
says
states
have
passed
laws
relying
on
it,
the
federal
system
is
now
structured
around
it,
why
isn't
the
damage
as
great
as
they
claim?
potential
damage,
i
should
say.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
address,
please,
the
practical
consequences.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
many
--
how
many
federal
courts
are
you
aware
are
already
charging
the
924(c)
facts
to
a
jury,
notwithstanding
the
--
the
fact
that
it's
not
required?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
say--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--do
you
have
any
statistics
on
at
least
924(c)
of
how
often
the
greater
is
the
sentence
than
the
absolute
minimum
required
by
law?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so,
in
effect,
your
argument
is
that
fixing
a
sentence
is
different
than
giving
a
judge
discretion
because
it
ignores
the
fact
that
a
judge
might
have
given
you
less?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
it's
depriving
you
of
the
constitutional
right
to
have
a
jury
decide
what
your
sentence
could
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
of
having
a
judge
decide
what
your
sentence
could
be?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about
booker?
what
did
booker
do--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
the
logic
of
apprendi?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
even
when
the
statutes
had
a
higher
maximum.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
the
jury
was
--
because
the
judge
was
constrained
within
a
different
maximum.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
your
argument
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
go
back
to
a
simple
question
on
the
stare
decisis,
the
practicality
question.
what
is
so
impractical
about
letting
a
jury
decide
an
issue
that
sets
a
mandatory
sentence
of
any
kind?
why
--
why
are
juries
incapable
of
figuring
out
whether
a
gun
was
carried
or
brandished?
why
are
they
incapable
of
figuring
out
how
many
--
how
much
drugs
were
sold
or
whether
someone
was
driven
by
any
of
the
factors
that
states
want
to
commit
to
judges,
but
the
sixth
amendment
might
require
them
to
submit
to
juries?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
needs,
the
constitutional
need
to
make
sure
that
juries
are
driving
a
fixed
sentence
of
any
kind?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
know,
but
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
dreeben,
can
i
go
back
to
a
point
you
made
earlier?
you
talked
about
a
legislature
not
attempting
to
supplant
the
jury's
role
on
the
maximum.
you
don't
see
the
same
danger
--
we
started
out
in
a
country
where
almost
all
sentencing
was
in
the
discretion
of
the
judge;
whatever
crime
you
committed,
the
judge
could
decide
where
to
sentence
you.
as
apprendi
and
its
subsequent
progeny
laid
out,
these
sentencing
changes
that
have
come
into
existence
have
really
come
into
existence
the
latter
half
of
the
last
century.
what
--
don't
you
fear
that
at
some
point
the
legislature
will
go
back
to
the
old
system
of
supplanting
the
jury
by
just
saying
what
it
said
in
924(c)?
every
single
crime
has
a
maximum
of
life.
and
all
the
--
and
every
single
fact
that's
going
to
set
a
real
sentence
for
the
defendant,
a
minimum,
we're
going
to
let
the
judge
decide
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
bottom
line
of
my
question
is,
when
apprendi
was
decided,
what
should
be
the
driving
force
of
protecting
the
jury
system?
the
deprivation
of
discretion,
whether
that's
permissible
or
not,
or
whether
a
sentence
is
fixed
in
a
range,
whatever
it
might
be,
by
a
jury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
better
rule
to
keep
both
extremes
from
happening?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
the
historical
--
you
said
earlier
that
most
of
the
historical
evidence
was
that
determinate
sentences
would
be
decided
by
juries;
they
found
facts
and
a
determinate
sentence
was
given.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
is
the
judicial
discretion
now?
you
find
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
a
mandatory
minimum
makes
you
give
seven.
so
where
is
the
judicial
discretion?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
think
for
a
defendant
in
a
constitutional
right,
that
they
are
more
--
that
it's
constitutional
to
have
a
determinate
sentence
at
seven,
and
still
constitutional
and
make
the
jury
find
it
by
a
--
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
it's
still
constitutional
to
have
a
determinative
sentence
of
7
years
but
have
the
jury
find
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
those
are
--
those
are
equal?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
know
we
said
it
in
harris;
the
question
here
before
us
today
is--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
how
about
in
o'brien,
if
the
legislature
had
said
40
years
for
a
machine
gun.
would
we
--
how
do
we
justify
saying,
no,
that
has
to
remain
an
element?
under
your
theory,
the
democratic
process
didn't
work.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
--
what
would
we
do
in
that
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
is
the
legislature
being
deprived
of
that
right,
if
they
give
it
to
the
jury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
you
give
it
to
a
jury
or
a
judge,
the
legislature
protects
itself
by
declaring
a
minimum
sentence.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
determines
the
sentence,
really.
