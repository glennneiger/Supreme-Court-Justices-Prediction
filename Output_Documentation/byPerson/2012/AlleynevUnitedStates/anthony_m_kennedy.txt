justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
was,
what
--
what
strategic
decision
do
you
think
the
lawyer
should
make?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
--
but
justice
alito
has
a
real
problem.
what
--
don't
you
put
the
defense
in
a
very
difficult
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
isn't
it
difficult
for
you
to
say
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
drugs
plus
the
drugs
didn't
weigh
more
than
a
certain
amount?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that
i
am
hearing
that
in
every
case
you
are
going
to
want
witnesses,
you
are
going
to
insist
on
a
jury
determination
of
the
amount.
that's
kind
of
what
i'm
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
alito
says
why
doesn't
that
put
defense
counsel
in
a
very
difficult
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
not
getting
far
with
this.
but
one
answer
you
could
say
is
that
in
order
to
preserve
the
constitutional
right
you
want
us
to
have
a
bifurcated
trial.
i
thought
you
might
say
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
good,
because
that's
an
extra
problem.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
could
say
that
with
reference
to
the
--
to
the
maximum.
everything
you
said
could
be
applied
to
the
maximum,
and
apprendi
says
you
can't
say
that.
