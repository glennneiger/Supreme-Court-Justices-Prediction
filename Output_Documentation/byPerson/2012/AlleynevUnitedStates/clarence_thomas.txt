justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
a
jury
found
the
petitioner
allen
ryan
alleyne
guilty
of
multiple
federal
offenses
for
his
participation
in
an
armed
robbery.
one
of
his
convictions
was
for
using
a
firearm
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence.
that
conviction
carried
a
sentencing
range
of
five
year
to
life
imprisonment,
but
if
the
court
found
that
petitioner
brandished
the
gun,
his
mandatory
sentence
automatically
increased
to
seven
years.
at
sentencing,
the
government
presented
evidence
of
brandishing
to
the
judge.
the
judge
ultimately
determined
that
petitioner
had
brandished
a
gun
thus
triggering
the
seven-year
mandatory
minimum.
unable
to
impose
a
lower
sentence,
the
judge
sentenced
petitioner
seven
years.
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed
petitioner
sentence.
petitioner
claims
that
the
application
of
the
seven-year
mandatory
minimum
violated
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial.
we
agree.
we
have
long
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
each
element
of
a
crime
to
be
proved
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
order
to
enforce
this
right,
we
must
know
which
facts
can
constitute
elements
of
a
crime.
legislators
have
brought
authority
to
define
the
elements
of
crimes,
but
this
authority
has
limits.
in
apprendi
versus
new
jersey,
we
held
that
any
fact
other
than
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
that
increases
a
defendant's
maximum
sentence
is
an
element
of
the
crime,
even
if
the
legislature
did
not
label
it
as
such.
we
explained
that
this
rule
was
consistent
with
the
historical
understanding
of
the
jury
trial
right
and
helped
to
preserve
the
role
of
the
jury
as
a
buffer
between
the
state
and
the
criminal
defendants.
this
case
requires
us
to
decide
whether
facts
increasing
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence
are
elements
of
the
crime
that
must
be
proved
to
a
jury
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
under
apprendi,
any
fact
that
exposes
a
defendant
to
a
punishment
greater
than
that
otherwise
legally
prescribed
is
by
definition
and
element
of
a
separate
legal
offense.
we
hold
that
this
principle
applies
with
equal
force
to
facts
that
increased
the
mandatory
minimum.
first,
increasing
the
floor
of
a
sentencing
range
alters
the
penalty
attached
to
the
crime
because
a
floor
and
the
ceiling
have
arranged
together
constitute
a
penalty.
second,
it
is
clear
that
moving
the
range
upward
even
if
only
by
racing
the
floor
makes
the
punishment
affixed
to
the
crime
more
severe.
the
defendants
expected
punishment
has
increased
as
a
result
of
the
narrowed
range
and
the
judge
must
impose
a
greater
punishment
if
he
finds
the
fact
triggering
the
mandatory
minimum
even
if
he
would
rather
impose
a
lower
sentence.
taking
these
two
points
together,
it
follows
that
facts
increasing
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence
are
within
the
principle
established
by
apprendi
and
therefore,
must
be
found
by
jury
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
in
this
case,
based
on
the
jury's
finding
along,
petitioner
was
only
subject
to
a
five-year
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
however,
the
district
court
applied
a
seven-year
mandatory
minimum
based
on
it's
finding
that
petitioner
had
brandished
the
gun.
for
the
above
reasons
and
other
reasons
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
this
sentence
violated
petitioner's
sixth
amendment
right
--
sixth
amendment
jury
trial
right.
we,
therefore,
vacate
this
--
his
sentence
on
the
firearm
count
and
remand
for
resentencing.
