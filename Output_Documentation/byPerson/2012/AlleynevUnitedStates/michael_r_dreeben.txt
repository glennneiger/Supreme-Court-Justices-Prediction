mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
should
adhere
to
its
decision
in
harris
v.
united
states,
which
reaffirmed
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania,
because
those
decisions
properly
respected
the
fact
that
a
mandatory
minimum
divests
the
defendant
of
the
right
to
judicial
leniency.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
sotomayor,
the
government's
argument
here
is
not
that
juries
are
incapable
of
finding
facts
under
the
federal
statutes
that
involve
mandatory
minimums.
it's
that
congress
has
sound
reasons
for
wishing
to
allocate
that
factfinding
to
the
sentencing
process
and
that
it
is
not
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
do
so.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
--
the
constitutional
question,
in
my
view,
justice
sotomayor,
turns
on
whether
there
is
a
right
to
the
mercy
of
a
tenderhearted
judge.
that
is
what
a
defendant
loses
when
a
judge
finds
a
mandatory
minimum
fact.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
breyer,
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
breyer,
we
have
a
chart
in
our
brief
that
i
think
is
addressed
explicitly
to
the
question
that
you
are
asking,
and
it's
on
page
36
of
our
brief.
and
it
illustrates
the
difference
between
an
apprendi
situation
and
a
harris-mcmillan
situation.
so
the
government's
gray
brief.
and
the
point
of
the
chart
is
this--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--this
is
page
36
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
okay.
the
point
of
apprendi
is
a
jury
cannot
be
reduced
to
low-level
gatekeeping.
congress
cannot
pass
a
statute
that
says
it
is
a
crime
to
assault
someone
and
that's
punishable
by
1
year
in
prison,
but
if
the
crime
involves
rape
then
it's
punishable
by
10
years
in
prison,
or
if
the
crime
involves
attempted
murder
then
it's
punishable
by
up
to
life.
congress
can't
do
that,
because
it
would
diminish
the
role
of
the
jury
in
finding
the
critical
facts
that
constitute
the
crime
that
sets
the
defendant's
maximum
exposure.
apprendi
protects
against
that.
in
a
harris
situation,
the
defendant
is
already
exposed
to
the
maximum
penalty
that
the
defendant
incurs
under
the
statute,
and
that's
what
the
second
column
illustrates.
the
defendant
who
commits
a
section
924(c)
crime
knows
that
the
defendant
faces
up
to
life
in
prison.
when
the
mandatory
minimum
comes
along,
it
doesn't
increase
the
defendant's
exposure
to
the
most
severe
punishment
he
can
get;
it
divests
the
defendant
of
a
degree
of
judicial
discretion.
but
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
protect
a
right
to
judicial
discretion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
not
just
in
my
mind,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
when
he
cannot--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
matters
because
the
sixth
amendment
protects
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
it
does
not
protect
a
right
to
judicial
leniency.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
because
in
--
in
the
other
situation,
it
protects
the
right
of
the
jury
to
determine
the
ingredients
of
the
crime
that
congress
has
determined
exposed
the
defendant--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
we
know--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
weren't
relevant
in
the
first
situation,
because
if
there
is
no
cap
from
the
maximum
that
a
judge
could
impose
based
on
judicial
factfinding,
the
role
of
a
jury
can
be
shrunk
to
what
the
court
has
called
low-level
gatekeeping.
that
can
never
happen
under
a
statute
that
increases
only
the
mandatory
minimum.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
certainly
doesn't
increase
the
maximum
punishment
that's
authorized
under
the
statute,
and
it
doesn't
prevent
the
judge
from
making
the
exact
same
finding
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
jury
did
not
make
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
giving
7
years
even
if
there
were
no
mandatory
minimums.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
first
of
all,
not
entirely
accurate
that
judges
do
not
give
higher
sentences
than
the
minimum.
there
are
plenty
of
cases
in
which
they
do
so.
if
the
920--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--but
taking
away
judicial
discretion
to
treat
a
fact
within
the
range
differently
than
what
congress
wants
doesn't
infringe
the
jury
trial
right.
the
jury
can
find
facts
by
a
--
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
when
the
judge
is
at
sentencing,
he
is
not
operating
under
that
burden,
so
the
fact
finding
role
of
the
jury--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
it's
quite
true
that
everything
that
i
said
applies
to
the
maximum,
justice
kennedy,
because
as
the
plurality
opinion
in
harris
explained,
once
the
court
has
been
confronted
with
a
defendant
who's
convicted,
the
judge's
discretion
extends
up
to
the
statutory
maximum.
he
can't
use
his
fact
finding
ability
to
increase
the
defendant's
exposure
to
criminal
punishment.
mandatory
minimums
can
never
do
that.
the
defendant
is
already
exposed
to
the
sentence
that
the
judge
could
give.
and
i
grant
you,
justice
kagan,
that
some
judges
might
choose
to
give
a
lower
sentence,
but
the
fact
that
they
might
choose
to
reflects
judicial
leniency,
tenderheartedness,
something
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
speak
to.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
judge
said
he
would
be
intellectually
honest
and
not
ignore
the
fact
that
the
--
the
finding
of
brandishing
did
trigger
the
mandatory
minimum.
he
did
not
say,
i
otherwise
would
have
given
five.
and
i
think
that
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
the
usual
case,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
it,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
way
this
case
evolves,
it's
not
even
clear
that
the
jury
rejected
brandishing.
what's
very
interesting
about
this
case
is
it's
possibly
the
best
illustration
of
the
unfairness
problem
that
justice
alito
alluded
to
and
that
justice
breyer
has
written
about
in
his
opinions.
the
issue
at
trial
in
this
case
was
identity.
was
the
defendant
actually
the
person
sitting
in
the
car
while
his
accomplice
walked
up
to
the
victim
and
--
and
put
a
revolver
into
his
neck
and
asked
for
money?
that
was
the
issue
at
trial.
there
was
no
discussion
of
brandishing
whatsoever.
nobody
focused
on
it,
and
it
allowed
the
defendant,
after
the
jury
rejected
his
identity
argument,
to
go
to
the
judge
and
say,
even
though
the
jury
has
now
found
that
my
guy
did
it,
he
could
not
have
foreseen
that
a
gun
would
have
been
used.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
that
the
court
recognized
in
apprendi
that
its
role
was
limited
and
to
certain
extent
could
be
evaded
by
legislatures
if
they
were
inclined
to
do
so.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
agree
in
part
with
both
you
and
justice
sotomayor
on
history.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
1790
crimes
act
that
the
first
congress
passed,
many
of
the
set
sentences
are
determinant
sentences.
others
of
the
sentences
were
--
were
prescribed
up
to
a
certain
amount
of
years,
and
within
that,
it
was
well
understood
that
judges
would
find
facts
to
graduate
the
penalties
according
to
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
and
what
the
legislatures
have
done
in
the
20th
century
innovation
of
mandatory
minimums
within
an
otherwise
authorized
range,
as
you
have
with
924(c),
is
say,
we
would
prefer
that
judges
take
into
account
brandishing
and
discharging
as
under
justice
kagan's
hypothetical
statute,
but
we
would
like
to
--
to
do
that
in
a
uniform
manner.
we
know
that
they
can
find
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
brandishing
exists.
we
know
that
many,
if
not
most,
judges
would
consider
that
worse
than
simple
possession
of
a
firearm
in
a
crime
of
violence,
and
we
want
judges
to
behave
consistently.
by
proscribing
consistency,
they
are
acting
in
accord
with
the
historical
tradition
of
having
determinate
sentences,
a
tradition
that
this
court
held
in
chapman
versus--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--and
there
was
no
judicial
discretion,
which
i
think
makes--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
judicial
discretion
is
what
the
defendant
is
losing.
he
is
not
losing
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
because
the
very
same
verdict
authorizes
the
judge
to
find
brandishing
and
impose
7
years.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
to
have
the
jury
find
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
just
my
position
that
it's
constitutional
for
a
--
a
judge
to
find
mandatory
minimum
triggering
facts
by
a
preponderance.
i'm
sure
that
a
legislature
could
allocate
that
to
a
jury.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
and
i
think
that
--
that
not
only
does
it
not
contradict
any
decision
of
this
court
to
allow
the
judge
to
make
those
findings,
it
doesn't
contradict
the
principle
behind
the
jury
trial
right
or
the
right
to
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
that's
the
difference
between
this
and
apprendi.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
descriptively
accurate,
but
it
says
nothing
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
procedure.
and
i
think
that
it's
very
important
to
focus
not
only
on
the
fact
that
stare
decisis
is
in
play,
but
that
apprendi
has
been
a
very
history-driven
area
of
the
law.
last
term,
when
the
court
extended
apprendi
to
fines,
it
has
found
an
ample
historic
basis
for
doing
so.
in
this
case,
by
comparison,
there
is
no
historical
showing
that
would
justify
extending
apprendi
to
fines.
not
only
is
there
no
direct
analogy
to
a
924(c)
type
statute,
but
the
three
pillars
of
their
historical
argument
are
extremely
weak
and
strained
analogies.
the
first
one
is
simply
that
to
get
a
statutory
crime
that
was
parallel
to
a
common
law
crime
but
differed,
the
prosecutor
had
to
charge
all
of
the
elements
of
the
statutory
crime
in
the
indictment.
that
says
nothing
about
mandatory
minimum
sentencing.
the
second
pillar
of
their
historical
argument
is
the
procedure
called
benefit
of
clergy,
which
was
a
form
of
what
blackstone
called
a
statute
pardon,
that
allowed
a
defendant
to
avoid
a
capital
sentence.
in
the
first
crimes
act
in
section
31
in
1790,
congress
said:
"benefit
of
clergy
shall
not
exist
in
the
united
states
for
any
crime
punishable
by
a
capital
sentence.
"
benefit
of
clergy
has
never
been
part
of
this
country's
sixth
amendment
heritage.
it
was
abolished
before
the
sixth
amendment
was
even
ratified.
and
the
third
pillar
of
their
historical
argument
are
three
late
19th
century
cases:
jones,
garcia,
and
lacy,
each
of
which
involve
statutes
that
both
raised
the
maximum
and
the
minimum,
not
a
single
one
of
them
spoke
about
the
constitution.
none
of
them
purported
to
define
what
a
legislature
could
do
if
it
wanted
to
raise
only
the
minimum,
and
that's
it.
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
kind
of
gertrude
stein
history
where
there's
really
no
“
there
”
there,
is
not
sufficient
to
overturn
the
legislative
prerogative
to
make
uniform
the
findings
of
fact
within
a
range--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
constitutional
argument
is
the
same.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
o'brien
suggests
that
unless
the
legislature
were
absolutely
clear
about
it,
the
court
would
conclude
that
those
would
be
deemed
elements.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
deemed
elements.
under
the
decision
in
o'brien,
where
the
machine
gun
finding
raised
the
minimum
to
30
years,
the
court
held
that
it
should
be
deemed
to
be
an
element,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
the
jury
is
being
a
low
level
gatekeeper
in
that
situation,
because
the
jury's
verdict
alone
--
and
this
is
a
serious
crime
--
exposes
the
defendant
to
a
life
sentence.
this
is
a
crime
that
involves
either
a
predicate
federal
crime
of
violence
or
a
federal
drug
trafficking
crime,
plus
the
use
of
the
gun
in
it.
and
i
think
congress
could
reasonably
expect
that
the
worse
the
use
of
the
gun,
the
more
extreme,
the
higher
the
corresponding
penalty.
and
indeed
if
a
924(c)
violation
is
charged
by
itself,
and
a
defendant
is
an
armed
career
criminal,
then
his
sentencing
range
goes
up
to
360
months
to
life--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
not
incongruous
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
fact
that
the
jury
verdict
itself
allows
a
life
sentence,
and
if
the
defendant
draws
the
proverbial
hanging
judge
who
in
his
discretion
or
her
discretion
wants
to
give
that
life
sentence,
the
defendant
knew
from
day
one
when
he
committed
the
crime
that
if
the
jury
finds
him
guilty
of
it,
he's
exposed
to
a
life
sentence.
and
the
court
in
apprendi
said
structural
democratic
constraints
will
preclude
legislatures,
or
at
least
discourage
them,
from
assigning
maximum
sentences
to
crimes
that
are
higher
than
what
the
legislature
deemed--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
that
situation,
the
democratic
process
would
have
concluded
that
firearms
brandishing,
discharge
or
use
of
a
machine
gun
is
an
extremely
serious
component
of
this
crime.
we
know
judges
will
take
that
into
account
in
sentencing.
we
simply
want
them
to
take
that
into
account
in
the
same
particularly
harsh
way.
and
in
--
in
trying
to
achieve
uniformity
among
judicial
actors
when
finding
facts
at
sentencing,
which
everybody
knows
that
they
will
do,
does
not
deprive
the
defendant
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
elements
of
the
crime,
it
deprives
him
of
the
right
to
a
judge
who
might
show
mercy
under
a
particular
set
of
facts.
and
that
simply
is
not
the
right
that's
embodied
in
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
agree
that
you
can
say
them,
justice
breyer--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--respectfully,
no.
we
--
the
critical
point
about
apprendi
is
by
assigning
the
role
of
constitutional
element
status
to
a
fact
that
increases
the
maximum,
the
court
has
preserved
the
jury
trial
right
against
its
reduction
to
essentially
a
formality
on
a
particular
subset
of
elements.
and
the
relationship
of
a
crime
that's
covered
by
apprendi
and
the
so-called
base
crime
is
like
a
greater
included
offense
and
a
lesser
included
offense.
whereas,
in
the
mandatory
minimum
situation,
we
know
that
the
judge
will
be
engaged
in
sentencing.
we
know
that
the
judge
will
find
facts
that
extend
beyond
the
elements
of
the
crime
to
inform
himself
about
how
the
basic
crime
is
committed.
we
also
know
that
different
judges
may
treat
those
facts
differently
after
finding
them
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
mandatory
minimum
changes
only
one
thing:
it
says,
judge,
if
you
find
this
fact,
brandishing
or
discharge,
you
will
impose
the
same
sentence
as
your
neighboring
judge
down
the
hall,
not
a
different
one
based
on
your
different
perception
of
sentencing
philosophy.
so
it
allows
the
legislature
to
intervene
after
having
defined
a
sufficiently
serious
enough
crime
and
determine
how
