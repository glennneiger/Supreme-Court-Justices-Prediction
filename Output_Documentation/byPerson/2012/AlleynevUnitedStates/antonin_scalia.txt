justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
distinguished
mcmillan.
you've
distinguished
harris.
how
do
you
distinguish
mcmillan?
your
only
grounds
for
distinguishing
that
is
it
was
not
a
sixth
amendment
case,
even
though
the
opinion
refers
to
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
about
“
mostly
”.
the
issue
is
whether
mcmillan
was
a
sixth
amendment
case,
in
part
or
in
whole.
and
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
it
wasn't.
we
--
we
don't
decide
cases
on
what
a
case
mostly
says.
we
decide
on
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
problem
if
the
question
had
to
be
decided
by
the
jury?
why
does
--
why
does
requiring
it
to
be
decided
by
the
jury
eliminate
that
problem
of
the
mixing
or
not
mixing?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
maguire,
could
you
repeat
the
first
sentence
you
uttered
in
this
argument?
i
hesitated
to
jump
in
so
early,
but
could
you
repeat
it
verbatim?
maybe
you
had
committed
it
to
memory.
good
--
good
counsel
often
does
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
that
wasn't
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
what
you
said
was:
who
has
to
decide
a
fact
which
causes
a
defendant
to
be
subject
to
a
penalty
that
he
would
not
otherwise
be
subject
to?
and
the
fact
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
mandatory
minimum
the
defendant
could
have
been
given
that
mandatory
minimum.
it
was
up
to
the
judge.
so
this
mandatory
minimum
does
not
increase
the
penalty
to
which
the
defendant
is
subject.
he's
subject
in
justice
kagan's
example
to
any
penalty
between
1
years
--
1
year
and
10.
the
judge,
even
without
the
statute
that
she
mentioned,
could
have
given
him
7
years
because
he
brandished
a
gun.
there
is
really
no
--
no
increase
in
the
penalty
to
which
he
is
exposed.
and
i
thought
that
is
what
apprendi
addressed,
any
increase
in
the
penalty
to
which
you
are
exposed,
so
that
when
you
decide,
i'm
going
to
rob
a
bank,
you
know,
when
you
go
in,
you
are
going
to
get
between
1
and
10
years,
and
with
a
mandatory
minimum
you
get
between
1
and
10
years.
so
what's
the
complaint
as
far
as
apprendi
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
leading
to
a
more
harsh
--
more
harsh
sentence.
that's
the
whole
point
of
apprendi:
does
it
lead
to
a
sentence
which
is
greater
than
the
judge
would
otherwise
be
authorized
to
impose?
and
in
the
case
of
a
mandatory
minimum,
it
never
is.
the
judge
could
impose
that
if
he
was
a
hanging
judge.
you
know,
you
have
some
hanging
judges;
you
have
some
bleeding
heart
judges.
and
--
and
what
a
mandatory
minimum
simply
says
is,
you
know,
we
don't
care
what
kind
of
a
judge
you
are,
at
least
this
much.
but
it
doesn't
expose
the
defendant
to
any
greater
penalty.
he's
--
he's
at
risk
between
1
and
10
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
seems
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
quoted
apprendi
correctly
as
saying
that
the
jury
has
to
decide
any
fact
which
increases
the
sentence
to
which
the
defendant
is
exposed.
that's
the
language
you
quoted,
and
it's
accurate.
why
does
a
mandatory
minimum
increase
the
sentence
to
which
the
defendant
is
exposed?
he
could
get
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
even
if
there
were
no
mandatory
minimum
prescribed.
he
is
exposed
to
a
sentence
of
1
to
10
years.
a
mandatory
minimum
says,
you
must
impose
7
years
if
he
brandishes.
but
the
sentence
to
which
he
is
exposed
is
1
to
10
years.
and
the
mandatory
minimum
does
not
change
that
at
all.
he
is
at
risk
for
1
to
10
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true,
but
you
must
acknowledge
that
that's
not
the
theory
of
apprendi.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
logic
of
apprendi
is
that
the
jury
has
to
decide
it
if
it
increases
the
sentence
to
which
the
defendant
is
exposed,
not
if
it
eliminates
some
discretion
of
the
court.
he's
exposed.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
a
mandatory
minimum
case,
booker
was
a
case
in
which
the
maximum
was
increased
on
the
basis
of
judge
finding
of
fact.
the
maximum
was
increased.
so
under
the
situation
in
booker,
the
--
the
exposure
of
the
defendant
was
indeed
increased
on
the
basis
of
judge
fact
finding.
instead
of
1
to
10,
the
statute
in
booker
said,
if
you
brandish
a
gun,
you
can
get
15.
that's
a
--
that's
a
quite
different
situation
from
saying,
yeah,
you
are
still
on
the
hook
for
1
to
10,
but
if
you
brandish,
you
got
to
get
7.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
page?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wonder
who
that
could
have
been.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
is
it
the
usual
case
that
a
judge
when
faced
with
his
decision
has
before
him
a
jury
finding?
i
--
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
petitioner
is
asking
these
cases
to
be
thrown
out
even
if
there
has
been
no
jury
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
judge
says,
you
know,
i
have
to
decide
whether
he
brandished
or
not;
i
think
he
brandished.
but
i
--
you
know,
the
petitioner
here
wants
to
say,
the
judge
cannot
consider
himself
bound
by
a
mandatory
minimum.
it
seems
to
me
the
unusual
case
in
which
you
have
a
jury
finding
that
the
judge
must
ignore
in
--
in
--
actually
he
doesn't
ignore
it,
he
goes
along
with
it.
the
jury
may
well
be
right
that
it's
impossible
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
--
that
the
felon
brandished
a
gun,
but
it's
--
it
--
it's
quite
easy
to
say
that
it's
very
likely
he
branded
a
gun
--
brandished
a
gun,
which
is
what
the
judge
has
to
find.
so
he's
not
even
ignoring
the
jury
finding.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
i
think
that
history
is
wrong.
in
fact,
the
way
the
country
started,
there
was
no
judicial
discretion.
there
were
simply
fixed
penalties
for
crimes.
if
you
stole
a
horse,
you
were
guilty
of
a
felony
and
you
would
be
hanged.
that's
where
we
started.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
would
think
that
the
risk
involved
is
whether
if
we
come
out
the
way
that
the
petitioner
here
urges
us
to
do,
legislatures
will
consider
going
back
to
--
to
where
we
started
from,
and
simply
saying,
if
you
brandish,
you
get
7
years,
period,
with
no
discretion
in
the
judge.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
greater
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
hear
your
last
word.
those
would
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
so
bad
he
wants
to
extend
it.
[laughter]
