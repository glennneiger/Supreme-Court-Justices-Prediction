ms.
maguire,
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
take
the
position
that
there's
no
stare
decisis
effect.
in
a
unanimous
--
and
a
recent
unanimous
decision
of
this
court,
obviously,
would
carry
more
weight
than
one
that
has
a
plurality
opinion,
so
you
don't
have
to
say
--
it
isn't
a
question
of
yes
or
no,
it's
a
question
of
the
degrees
of
respect
that
we
would
give
to
our
former
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
drug
weight.
let's
--
so
you're
making
--
your
argument
would
mean
that
drug
weight
also
has
to
be
found
by
the
jury,
because
that
can
--
the
length
of
the
sentence
can
depend
on
the
--
the
drug
weight.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
about
in
deference
to
the
jury's
finding?
i
mean,
in
this
--
this
--
this
very
case,
wasn't
it
so
that
the
judge
said,
i
could
just
say
7
years
because
it's
within
the
range,
but
it
would
be
dishonest
of
me
to
do
that,
wouldn't
it?
i
have
to
say
seven
because
it's
the
mandatory
minimum.
i
think
this
is
a
case
where
the
effect
is
shown
graphically,
that
the
judge
says,
i'm
stuck
with
the
stuck.
i
would
prefer
five.
that's
what
the
jury
would
lead
me
to
do,
but
i'm
--
my
hands
are
tied,
i
cannot
respect
the
jury's
finding.
