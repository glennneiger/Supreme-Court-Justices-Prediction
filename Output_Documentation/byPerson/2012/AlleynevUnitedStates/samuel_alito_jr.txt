justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
isn't
your
position
that
a
decision
of
this
court
is
not
entitled
to
stare
decisis
protection
if
there
isn't
a
majority
opinion
in
that
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
can
think
of
some
pretty
important
decisions
of
this
court
that
were
not
the
result
of
a
majority
opinion.
do
you
want
us
to
adopt
that
as
a
blanket
rule?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court
not
decided
with
the
majority
opinion,
no
stare
decisis
effect.
that's
your
argument?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
important
for
this
court
to
have
a
consistent
doctrine
of
stare
decisis.
the
doctrine
can't
be
we
will
overrule
decisions
that
we
don't
like,
but
we
will
stick
with
decisions
that
the
majority
does
like.
so
i'm
still
looking
for
your
understanding
of
what
stare
decisis
means
in
constitutional
cases.
now,
with
the
suggestion
of
justice
ginsburg,
i
gather
that
your
position
is
if
it's
a
narrow
decision
then
it's
--
stare
decisis
has
less
weight;
is
that
it?
now,
what
other
factors?
so
it
has
less
weight.
why
isn't
it
controlling,
though?
why
does
it
have
insufficient
weight
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
now,
if
you
were
defending
a
case
involving
drug
weight
and
your
client
maintained
that
he
or
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
these
drugs,
how
would
you
proceed?
your
argument
would
be:
they're
not
my
drugs,
but
if
they
were
my
drugs,
they
weren't
--
they
didn't
weigh
more
than
one
kilo.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
is
booker
--
why
is
booker
entitled
to
greater
stare
decisis
weight
than
harris
and
mcmillan?
