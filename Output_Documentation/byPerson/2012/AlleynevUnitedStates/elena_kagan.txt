but
why
is
this
not
workable?
i
mean,
you
can
--
you
can
argue
about
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong.
you
can
argue
about
whether
it
has
created
some
incongruity
in
the
system.
but
haven't
the
last
number
of
years
suggested
that
it's
perfectly
workable?
everybody
knows
what
they
are
supposed
to
do,
everybody
does
it.
why
--
why
is
this
not
workable?
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
maguire,
could
i
take
you
to
a
different
kind
of
question?
justice
elena
kagan
let's
assume
that
there
were
a
statute
and
it
said
carrying
a
gun
is
an
offense
and
that
the
range
is
5
to
10
years.
i
realize
it
goes
up
further
in
the
real
word,
but
let's
just
say
5
to
10
years.
and
congress
said
in
setting
the
penalty
within
that
range
the
judge
shall
consider
whether
the
defendant
brandished
the
gun
and
whether
the
defendant
discharged
the
gun.
now
--
and
that's
all
the
statute
said.
that
would
be
constitutional,
is
that
not
right?
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
so
it's
constitutional
for
the
judge
to
say,
7
years
because
you
brandished,
9
years
because
you
discharged.
so
what
makes
it
unconstitutional,
what
makes
it
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment,
when
now
congress
just
provides
something
extra
in
the
statute?
it
says,
not
just
you
shall
consider
brandishing
and
discharging,
but
if
you
find
brandishing
you
get
7,
if
you
find
discharging,
you
get
9.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
seems
right
as
a
definitional
matter,
as
a
descriptive
matter.
but
i
guess
the
question
i'm
having
difficulty
with
is
why
does
that
matter
for
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment?
the
jury
is
doing
the
exact
same
thing,
which
is
the
jury
isn't
doing
anything
in
either
of
my
examples.
so
the
only
difference
between
example
number
one,
which
you
said
was
constitutional,
and
example
number
two
is
that
now
congress
is
giving
further
instruction
to
the
judge,
but
nothing
more
is
being
taken
away
from
the
jury,
is
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
apprendi
goes
both
ways.
i
mean,
that's
the
best
sentence
for
you
in
apprendi,
but
there
are
other
sentences
in
apprendi
which
more
go
towards
what
justice
scalia
suggested,
that
the
question
was
increasing
it
above
the
maximum
that
the
jury
authorized.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
we
can
get
from
the
language
of
apprendi
--
and
i
guess
the
question
is
as
a
matter
of
principle.
i
completely
understand
why
a
defendant
would
care
about
this.
the
question
is,
does
it
--
does
it
create
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
which
is,
you
know,
the
jury
has
to
do
this,
when
--
when
congress
is
decreasing
the
judge's
discretion,
but
it's
--
either
way
the
jury
isn't
deciding
this.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
you
said,
mr.
dreeben,
and
--
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
a
great
question:
is
the
jury
functioning
as
a
low
level
gatekeeper
under
the
harris
rule?
because
i
could
make
the
argument
that
in
fact
it
is.
you
know,
you
take
a
statute
and
it
says,
5
and
up
for
carrying,
and
7
and
up
for
brandishing,
right?
and
this
isn't
even
a
hypothetical.
this
is
pretty
close
to
this
case.
it
goes
to
the
jury,
the
jury
says
we
think
he
was
carrying,
we
do
not
think
that
he
was
brandishing,
all
right?
and
then
it
goes
to
the
judge.
and
now
the
judge
says,
you
know
what,
if
i
had
my
druthers,
i
would
only
give
5
years.
if
i
had
my
druthers,
i
absolutely
would
defer
to
the
jury
verdict,
but
i
can't
defer
to
the
jury
verdict
because
congress
has
said
i
have
to
make
this
special
factfinding,
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
i
think
he
did
brandish,
and
so
i
have
to
give
7
years.
so
the
judge
is
not
deferring
to
the
jury,
and
he's
not
deferring
to
the
jury
when
he
would
prefer
to
do
so.
i
guess
the
question
is:
isn't
that
in
every
practical
sense
--
doesn't
the
mandatory
minimum
effectively
increase
the
maximum
punishment
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
otherwise
would
get?
justice
elena
kagan
yes,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
the
world
of
judges,
you
know,
this
--
the
graph
you
wrote
has
very
little
difference
in
the
harris
situation
between
five
and
seven,
but
in
fact
most
judges
want
to
give
five.
i
mean,
that's
the
truth
of
the
matter,
that,
you
know,
nobody's
given
a
97-year
sentence.
so
--
so
the
action
in
the
criminal
justice
system
is
at
this
lower
range.
and
at
this
lower
range,
what
the
mandatory
minimums
do
is
effectively
tell
a
judge
that
they
cannot
defer
to
a
jury
verdict.
justice
elena
kagan
i
know
there
are
plenty
of
cases.
all
i'm
saying
is
it's
not
the
unusual
case
to
find
ourselves
in
exactly
this
position,
where
the
judge
wants
to
give
five,
the
jury
wants
to
give
five,
the
judge
can't
defer
to
the
jury's
verdict
that
it
should
be
five.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dreeben,
could
i
take
you
back
to
the
principles
involved?
let's
suppose
that
instead
of
this
statute,
which
is
579,
you
had
a
statute
which
was
five
for
carrying,
five
otherwise
and
then
for
brandishing,
40.
all
right?
and
maybe
if
we
did
discharge,
then
60.
all
right.
so
a
very
large
gap.
is
your
argument
still
the
same?
justice
elena
kagan
but
suppose
the
legislature--
justice
elena
kagan
--suppose
--
suppose
that
congress
is
absolutely
clear
about
it,
and
you
say
--
and
i
think
that
you're
right,
you've
got
to
be
right
about
this
--
it's
a
constitutional
matter,
it's
the
same,
but
the
hypothetical
sort
of
suggests
exactly
what
you
said
our
inquiry
ought
to
be,
is
that
in
a
world
like
that,
the
jury
is
in
fact
functioning
only
as
a
low
level
gatekeeper.
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
and
that
the
only
reason
we
see
it
in
the
hypothetical
a
little
bit
more
clearly
is
because
the
numbers
are
a
bit
more
dramatic.
justice
elena
kagan
if
it's
something
deeply
incongruous,
isn't
there,
where
you
have
an
apprendi
rule
which
says
if
the
maximum
is,
you
know,
five
to
seven,
and
then
the
judge
says
7
years
and
a
day,
we're
going
to
take
that
out.
but
as
a
mandatory
minimum
that
will
leapfrog
you
from
five
to
40
doesn't
get
the
same
result?
