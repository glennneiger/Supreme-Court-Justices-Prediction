justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it
isn't
quite.
i
mean,
the
--
the
linguistic
difference,
i
agree
with
justice
scalia
and
i
agree
with
you,
it
turns
on
the
word
“
exposed
”.
i
mean,
if
you
state
apprendi's
holding
as
it
was
just
stated,
this
is
a
different
case
because
you
could
in
fact,
if
you
were
the
defendant,
have
been
sentenced
to
that
anyway.
that's
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
let's
put
it
differently.
there
is
a
fact
in
the
world.
there's
a
gun
or
there
wasn't
a
gun.
in
the
apprendi
case,
if
the
fact
turns
out
to
be
gun,
you
could
get
2
more
years.
all
right?
we
have
to
go
to
the
jury.
now,
here
there's
a
fact
in
the
world,
gun
or
not
gun.
if
it
turns
out
not
gun,
you
get
a
lower
sentence,
you
could;
and
if
it
turns
out
to
be
the
fact,
gun,
you
can't
--
the
judge
cannot
put
you
in
that
box,
he
has
to
put
you
in
a
worse
box.
he
has
to
put
you
in
a
worse
box.
he
has
to
give
you
more
than
--
more
than
the
3
years,
2
years
or
1
year.
he
has
to.
okay?
now,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant,
worse
or
at
least
as
bad.
from
the
point
of
view
of
congress,
same.
they
drew
some
lines,
want
a
judge
to
administer
them,
and
they
turn
on
facts,
and
the
sentence
very
often
will
turn
on
those
facts.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
judge,
same.
it's
the
jury
decides
or
he
decides.
in
the
one
case,
his
discretion
is
cut
off
to
give
a
lower
sentence;
in
the
other
case,
his
discretion
is
granted
to
give
a
higher
sentence.
now,
i
see
tremendous
similarities,
though
i
grant
you
the
words
are
different,
but
can
you
--
can
you
just
explain--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
the
difference
in
the
words
should
overcome
the
fact
that
i
can't
think
of
a
--
of
a
difference
other
than
those
words
that
happened
to
be
used
in
apprendi?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
afraid
the
other
side
was
upside
down
and
i
saw
what
you
meant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
--
that's
the
--
you've
used
all
the
words,
which
do
make
the
difference
in
your
mind.
but
my
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
why
should
those
words
make
a
difference?
look,
in
the
one
case,
i'll
be
repeating
myself,
but
i
want
you
to
see
it,
in
the
one
case,
presence
of
a
fact
or
not
means
the
defendant
goes
into
a
higher
sentencing
box.
and
the
other
case,
presence
of
a
fact
or
not
means
that
he
cannot
go
into
the
low
sentencing
box.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
one
case,
he
cannot
go
into
the
low
sentencing
box;
in
the
other
case,
he
can't
go
into
the
high
sentencing
box.
i
got
that
difference.
my
only
problem
is,
why
does
it
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it's
not
--
well,
you
can
call
it
judicial
leniency,
but
you
could
call
the
other
judicial
harshness.
i
mean,
what
is
in
fact
turning
out--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
here
we
have
the
ingredients
of
a
crime
that
congress
has
determined
that
you
have
to
get
the
5
years.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
in
the
one
case
you
can
say
all
that
apprendi
did
--
it
never
should
have
been
decided;
i
mean,
some
of
us
thought
that
--
because
in
fact--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
you're
talking
about
there
is
that
you
are
stopping
the
judge
from
exhibiting
his
otherwise
discretion
towards
harshness,
and
that's
a
matter
for
judges.
i've
heard
all
these
arguments
before,
you
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i've
just
heard
them
in
the
context
of
harshness,
and
now
i
don't
know
why
changing
it
to
leniency
makes
them
somehow
more
relevant.
they
weren't
apparently
relevant
in
the
first
situation,
so
why
are
they
relevant
in
this
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here's
another
way
of
putting
the
same
point:
with
the
mandatory
minimum,
the
judge
can't
go
below
the
5
years,
okay?
but
you
say,
well,
he
could
have
gone
below
the
5
years
anyway,
couldn't
he
have?
i
mean,
you
--
he
could
have
given
you
the
5
years
anyway.
sorry,
he
could
have
given
you
the
5
years
anyway.
that's
your
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
he
could
have
given
you
the
5
years
--
he
could
have
given
you
the
5
years
if
you'd
been
--
if
you
had
been
convicted
of
a
different
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
the
best
way
i
thought
of
putting
it
is
the
heading
on
page
6
of
their
reply
brief
is
almost
right,
i
think.
it
says
--
it's
permitting
judges
to
find
facts
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
compels
sentences
higher
than
a
set
of
those
permitted
by
the
jury's
verdict.
that's
exactly
what's
going
on
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
--
and
i
want
to
know,
what
is
it?
and
the
trouble
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
just
going
to
say,
well,
he
could
have
given
the
same
sentence
anyway.
and
i'm
going
to
say,
well,
so
what,
why
does
that
matter?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
--
i
don't
know
if
you
can
add
anything
to
this,
but
remember,
i
agree
with
you
about
the
history,
but
i
just
apply
it
to
apprendi,
too.
so
the
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
thought
--
are
you
sure
it
was
gertrude
stein
and
not
dorothy
barker?
but
i
think
you're
probably
right
about
that.
but
the
--
the
--
i'm
thinking
of
this
as
well,
apprendi,
i
see
what
they're
thinking.
they're
thinking
that
once
you
have
to
add
the
extra
fact
to
get
above
the
otherwise
ceiling,
it's
like
a
new
crime.
it
isn't
really
a
new
crime,
but
it's
like
a
new
crime.
okay?
but
then
i
can
say,
well,
once
you
have
to
really
cut
off
that
5
years
and
less
and
really
send
him
to
jail
for
5
years,
hey,
that's
just
like
a
new
crime.
so
why
can't
i
say
everything
that
we
said
about
apprendi
here,
except
i
can't
deny
what
you
say,
the
judge
could
have
given
the
sentence
anyway.
that's
absolutely
right.
but
all
the
other
things,
i
can
say.
is
that
true?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
mean,
are
they
true?
[laughter]
