ms.
mary
e.
maguire
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
who
gets
to
decide
the
facts
that
trigger
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
any
fact
that
entitles
a
prosecution
by
law
to
a
sentence
more
severe
than
a
judge
could
otherwise
impose
must
be
found
by
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
under
harris,
the
government
is
entitled--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--yes,
justice
sotomayor.
i
do
not
believe
that
stare
decisis
poses
a
problem
for
the
court
in
this
case,
because
harris
was
a
plurality
opinion.
and
while
four
of
the
justices
found
that
--
i'm
sorry,
five
of
the
justices
voted
to
uphold
mcmillan,
only
four
of
the
justices
found
that
mcmillan
was
consistent
with
apprendi.
and
so
we
have
a
plurality
opinion,
and
for
our
constitutional
issue,
we
do
not
believe
that
harris--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--well,
first
of
all,
i
would
just
note
that
even
though
mcmillan
was
decided
in
1986,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
congress
referred
on
mcmillan
when
it
passed
924(c).
in
addition,
924(c)
is
silent
as
to
who
should
be
the
fact-finder
that
triggers
the
mandatory
minimum.
and
finally,
in
the
mcmillan
case,
that
was
not
really
a
sixth
amendment
case--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--certainly.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
yes,
i
would
say
that
there
is
little
to
no
practical
effect
if
the
court
is
to
adopt
a
rule,
because
the
majority
of
the
federal
courts
are
already
--
and
federal
prosecutors
are
already
--
alleging
these
facts
in
the
indictment
and
proving
them
to
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
i
think
that
this
case
is
the
exact
example
of
that.
it
was
alleged
in
the
indictment.
it
went
to
the
jury,
the
jury
got
a
special
verdict
form,
so
there
is
no
difficulty
in
implementing
this
rule--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--yes,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
harris
has
precedential
value,
because
it
is
a
plurality
opinion.
in
our--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--no,
your
honor,
but
i
would
note
that
in
constitutional
questions
like
this
one,
stare
decisis
is
at
its
weakness
--
weakest.
i
would
also--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--well,
and
also,
your
honor,
what
i
think
is
significant
in
this
case
in
terms
of
the
issue
of
stare
decisis
is
that
mcmillan
was
not
a
sixth
amendment
case.
mcmillan
was
decided
more
on
due
process
grounds.
and
the
only
discussion
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
mcmillan
comes
in
the
last
paragraph,
when
it
talks
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
has
no
right
to
jury
sentencing.
and
so
for
those
reasons,
we
do
not
believe
that
stare
decisis
poses
a
problem.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
your
honor,
it
does
in
fact
refer
to
the
sixth
amendment
in
the
very
last
paragraph.
but
what
mcmillan
was
mostly
concerned
about
was
a
due
process
claim--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--that's
absolutely--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--i
think
that
that
is
exactly
right,
justice
ginsburg.
and
in
fact
the
other
factors
that
the
court
considers
when
looking
at
stare
decisis
is:
what
were
the
margins
of
vote
on
the
previous
cases,
and
mcmillan
was
decided
on
a
5-4
decision,
whereas
harris,
as
we've
noted,
was
a
plurality
decision.
both
opinions
were
found
over
spirited
dissents.
they
have
been
criticized
by
this
court
and
the
lower
courts,
and
in
all
of
those
instances
we
believe
that
stare
decisis
is
at
its
weakest.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
because,
justice
alito,
another
thing
that
you
look
to
when
you
are
considering
stare
decisis
is
whether
or
not
the
rule
is
workable,
whether
or
not
the
prior
decision
was
badly
reasoned,
and
those
are
other
factors
that
the
court
can
consider.
and
if
you
look
at
this
court's
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
as
it
has
developed
since
apprendi,
then
in
booker,
then
in
blakely,
then
in
cunningham,
what
we
are
asking
for
today
is
a
logical--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--well,
the
harris
rule
is
not
workable
on
a
practical
level
because
what
happens
under
the
harris
rule
is
the
government
is
entitled
to
a
fact
that
drives
a
more
severe
punishment,
that
never
goes
to
the
jury.
and
what
we
are
asking
here
is
that
the
court
find
that
where
there
is
a
fact
that
triggers
a
mandatory
minimum,
that
that
fact
be
found
by
the
jury.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
i
think
it
becomes
unworkable
in
the
drug
cases,
your
honor,
and
in
the
9841
statute,
because
what
you
have
there
is
you
have
in
some
circuits
people
alleging
drug
weight,
but
in
other
circuits
you
have
what
is
called
mixing
and
matching.
and
as
long
as
the
statutory
maximum
does
not
exceed
20
years,
the
prosecutors
are
not
alleging
the
drug
weights
in
the
indictment.
and
that
becomes
unworkable
and
quite
confusing
to
the
courts.
and
the
lower
courts
have
criticized
the
harris
rule
primarily
in
cases
like
krieger
and
others
that
we
--
are
cited
in
our
amicus
brief,
that
the
rule
is
somewhat
unworkable.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
asking
it
to
be
found
by
a
jury
solves
the
problem
because
it
allows
the
fact
to
go
to
the
jury,
the
jury
finds
it,
and
we
have
a
long
history
in
this
country
that
jury
verdicts
drive
punishment.
and
so
the
idea
is
that
the
punishment
that
somebody
is
open
to
should
be
driven
by
the
jury
verdict.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
if
the
drug
weight
is
going
to
trigger
a
mandatory
minimum,
your
honor,
yes,
we
would
say
that
under
our
rule
that
that
would
have
to
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
proved
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which,
as
our
amicus
briefs
point
out,
is
being
done
already
in
the
majority
of
circuits
throughout
the
country.
and
so
this
is
not
going
to
put
any
additional
burden
on
the
prosecutors
to
be
doing
this,
and
fundamentally
what
it
does
is
that
it
levels
the
playing
field,
because
what
it
does
in
trial
situations
is
it
allows
a
defendant
to
know
exactly
what
it
is
that
the
government
is
going
to
prove.
the
government
then
has
to
bring
in
those
witnesses
at
the
time
of
trial
so
that
they
can
be
cross-examined
on
this
fact
that
is
going
to
trigger
the
mandatory
minimum
in
their
case,
and
so
it
helps
level
the
playing
field
in
that
regard.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
justice
alito,
those
are
strategical
questions
that
come
up
in
every
trial
case
that
we
have.
and
you
have
to
decide
as
a
trial
lawyer
what
your
theory
of
the
defense
is
going
to
be.
it's
simply
going
to
be,
i
wasn't
there,
or
you
may
decide
to
challenge
the
drug
weight.
but
those
--
those
strategic
decisions
exist
whether
or
not
the
court
adopts
this
rule
or
doesn't
adopt
the
rule.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
any
strategic
decision
a
lawyer
makes
is
going
to
depend
on
the
individual
facts
of
the
case.
for
example--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--you
don't
put
the
defense
in
a
very
difficult
position,
because
in
fact
if
you
adopt
our
rule
we
believe
that
you
are
protecting
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
to
a
jury
because
this
is
a
fact
that
is
going
to
be
triggering
a
mandatory
minimum.
and
if
the
government
has
to
prove
it,
they
then
have
to
bring
in
the
witness
to
the
trial,
who
is
then
subject
to
cross-examination,
which
is
a
far
more--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--i
don't
believe
that
that
is
difficult,
and
i
believe
that
those
are
decisions
that
you
make
in
every
case.
for
example,
in
the
case
--
in
this
case,
in
mr.
alleyne's
case--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--that
is
the
rule,
justice
kennedy,
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
adopt,
that
if
there's
a
fact--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--well,
it
doesn't
put
defense
counsel
in
a
difficult
position
at
all,
because
those
are
the
same
decisions
that
you
make
whether
or
not
you
adopt
this
rule
or
you
don't
adopt
this
rule.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
no,
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
asking
for
a
bifurcated
trial.
we
are
just
asking
that
if
there's--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--certainly.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
yes,
justice
kagan,
that
would
be
constitutional,
because
it
doesn't
have
the
mandatory
effect.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
okay.
what
makes
that
unconstitutional
is
because
you
are
stripping
the
judge
of
all
authority,
and
by
operation
of
law
you
are
telling
that
judge
that,
you
must
impose
this
sentence.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
yes,
it
is,
because
in
your
second
hypothetical
where
it
is
the
mandatory
minimum,
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case,
this
notion
that
somehow
congress
is
channelling
discretion
is
a
fiction,
because
what
it
does
is
it
tells
the
judge,
you
must
impose
7
years
and
you
cannot
even
consider
what
is
authorized
by
the
jury
verdict
in
this
case.
and
the
jury
verdict
in
this
case
authorized
a
range
of
5
years
as
the
bottom.
and
so
what
happens
is
when
you
have
congress
coming
in
and
saying
that
if
you
find
this
fact
on
a
mere
preponderance
standard
you
must
impose
7
years,
then
you
are
stripping
the
defendant
of
the
benefit
of
the
full
jury
verdict
in
this
case,
which
authorized
a
range
that
had
a
lower
floor
than
that
called
for
by
the
federal
statute.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
my
very
first
sentence
was:
this
case
is
about
who
gets
to
decide
the
facts
that
trigger
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
the
complaint
is
that
--
and
why
we
believe
that
the
rule
we
are
asking
the
court
to
adopt,
justice
scalia,
is
a
natural
--
it
follows
the
logic
of
apprendi,
is
because
in
both
cases
you
have
judicial
factfinding
that's
leading
to
a
more
harsh
sentence.
in
your--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--well,
and
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that's
--
that's
a
false
presumption.
and
i
think
that's
the
position
of
the
government,
that
somehow
mandatory
minimums
channel
discretion
within
a
range.
that
is
a
fiction
because
the
judge
is
being
told,
you
must
impose
this.
you
have
no
choice.
you
cannot
go
below
this.
that
is
the
whole
nature
of
a
mandatory
minimum,
and
so
this--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--well,
justice
sotomayor,
this
court
found
in
o'brien,
and
i
think
that
it's
also
cited
in
the
lucas
briefs
and
dorsey
briefs
that
this
court
is
holding,
that
the
majority
of
all
defendants
convicted
under
924(c)
are,
in
fact,
sentenced
at
the
mandatory
minimum.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
that
is
exactly
right.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
that
is
exactly
right.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
that
is
exactly
right,
and
it's
further
depriving
you
--
it
is
depriving
the
defendant
of
liberty
interests.
it
is
imposing
a
stigma,
and
it
is
entitling
the
prosecutor
to
a
greater
and
more
severe
punishment.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
actually
the
language
of
this
court
in
apprendi
said
that
"it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
legislature
to
remove
from
the
jury
the
assessment
of
facts
that
increase
the
prescribed
range
of
penalties
to
which
a
criminal
defendant
is
exposed.
"
and
that
is
exactly
what's
happening
in
this
context
because--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--well,
justice
kagan,
we
do
believe
the
sixth
amendment
is
implicated
because
we
think
the
history
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
this
country
shows
that
the
role
of
the
jury
is
the
buffer
between
the
citizen
meant
to
protect
and
the
government.
and
mandatory
minimums
give
the
prosecution
far
much
power
and,
in
fact,
if
you
do
not
adopt
our
rule
and
--
and
make
the
government
have
to
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
what
happens
is
then
the
average
citizen
does
not
get
the
benefit
of
a
jury
verdict
and
his
sentence
is
not
driven
wholly
by
the
jury
verdict,
because
in
this
case
we
had
a
jury
verdict,
the
government
alleged
the
fact,
we
had
a
special
verdict
form,
and
the
jury
failed
to
find
that
fact.
as
a
result
of
that,
then,
the
range
that
mr.
alleyne
should
have
been
exposed
was
a
5-year
mandatory
minimum
and
for
the
constitutional
argument
assuming
a
maximum
of
life.
here
what
happened,
then,
at
the
sentencing
hearing
was
on
a
mere
preponderance
the
judge
had
to
impose
seven.
and
so
we
believe
that
is
where
you
have
the
sixth
amendment
problem,
because
the
defendant--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--well,
i
understand
that
that
may
not
change
the
exposure.
what
it
does
on
a
practical
level
is
it
prevents
the
judge
from
even
considering
anything
less
than
the
7
years.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
and
that
becomes
the
problem.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
i
think
the
theory
of
apprendi
if
you
--
if
you
take
it
out
to
its
logical
step
is
that
if
you
have
judicial
fact
finding
that
is
resulting
in
a
more
harsh
sentence
being
imposed,
then,
in
fact,
you
have
a
sixth
amendment
problem.
and
so
what
happens
on
a
mandatory
minimum
is
that
if
a
judge
finds
the
mandatory
minimum
a
more
harsh
sentence
is
being
imposed,
because
as
an
example
in
this
case,
the
judge
could
not
even
consider
giving
the
5-year
year
floor
as
a
mandatory
minimum,
which
we've
already
noted
is,
in
fact,
how
most
criminal
defendants
are
sentenced
under
the
924(c)
statute
at
the
mandatory
minimum
level.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
i
think--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--justice
sotomayor,
what
i
believe
that
booker
did
is
that
booker
indicated
that
when
you
have
a
fact
that
drives
--
a
finding
of
fact
that
drives
a
mandatory
sentence
to
be
imposed,
that
obviously
that
was
the
sixth
amendment
problem.
now,
i
understand
and
appreciate--
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
yes.
and
so
what
i
believe
is
that
what
booker
indicates
is
that
it
is
this
mandatory
effect
which
may
--
and
that
is
why
this
court
found,
extending
apprendi
in
the
booker
case,
that
in
fact
the
guidelines
then
had
to
become
advisory.
it
is
the
mandatory
effect
of
the
fact
finding
that
is
essential
in
these
cases.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
concern
in
booker
was
the
mandatory
nature
of
the
guidelines,
and
while
i
would
agree
with
you
that
this
court
in
its
constitutional
part
of
the
booker
decision
did,
in
fact,
look
to
the
increase
in
the
maximums,
it
is
the
same
problem.
you
have
judge
--
judicial
fact
finding
that
is
mandating
a
particular
sentence.
ms.
mary
e.
maguire
well,
i
believe
that
booker
is
--
is
entitled
to
greater
weight
because
it
was
more
recently
decided
by
this
court,
and
i
also
believe
that
it
is
a
more
recent
interpretation
of
this
court
of
the
principles
held
in
apprendi.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder

it
is
the
effect
of
the
fact
finding
that
is
important,
not
what
it
is
called.
a
mandatory
minimum
does,
in
fact,
increase
the
exposure
that
a
defendant
is
--
is
exposed
to,
because
his
range
then
goes
from
five
to
life,
which
was
wholly
authorized
by
the
jury's
verdict
in
this
case,
to
seven
to
life,
and
that
is
an
increase.
and
we
are
not
talking
about
a
right
to
leniency,
but
a
right
for
the
judge
to
consider
the
full
range
that
the
jury
authorized.
and
i
would
note
the
language
in
apprendi
did,
in
fact,
address
this
issue
of
range
when
it
said:
"one
need
only
look
to
the
kind,
degree,
or
range
of
punishment
to
which
the
prosecution
is
by
law
entitled
for
a
given
set
of
facts.
"
thank
you.
