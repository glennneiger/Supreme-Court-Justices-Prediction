mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
stark
choice
between
two
plausible
definitions
of
the
phrase,
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
our
definition
is
the
more
consistent
with
the
english
language,
and
is
the
only
definition
that
does
not
do
mischief
with
the
same
use
of
that
phrase
each
time
it's
repeated.
ours
is
the
only
one
consistent
with
a
400-year
common
law
history,
and
65-year-old
right
that
was
in
the
statute
through
1976,
and
consistent
with
the
principle
that
congress
doesn't
abolish
those
things
without
being
clear.
ours
gives
the
copyright
owners
much
of
what
they
asked
for
when
they
were
seeking
an
importation
provision,
just
not
everything;
whereas,
wiley's
grants
them
rights
far
beyond
anything
that
anyone
could
have
imagined
asking
for
back
then.
ours--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
to
put
a
finer
point
on
it,
ours
is
that
lawfully
made
under
this
title
means
made
wherever,
in
a
way
that
satisfies
u.s.
copyright
standards,
made
in
accordance
with--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--international
exhaustion.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i
have
a
few
answers
to
that.
the
first
is
it
is
not
true
that
no
country
adopts
national
exhaustion.
congress
adopted
national
exhaustion
in
sections
905
and
906
6
years
after
the
statute
was
passed,
as
to
microchips.
but
second,
wiley
is
making
the
point
that
there
is
now
a
norm.
they
say
most
states
--
most
countries,
that
is.
back
in
1976
wiley
is
not
even
arguing
that
there
was
any
international
norm,
much
less
that
the
drafters
of
the
statute
were
focused
on
international
norms;
and
the
truth
is
that
there
isn't
an
international
consensus
around
national
exhaustion.
we
know
that
for
a
fact.
in
1994
when
125
nations
got
together,
they
--
they
agreed
to
disagree
on
international
copyright
exhaustion
principles,
and
they
codified
that
disagreement,
to
each
his
own,
in
the
trips
agreement.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor,
not
to
quibble;
they
don't
follow
national
exhaustion.
they
follow
regional
exhaustion.
so--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--agreed,
your
honor,
but
it
is
regional,
it's
not
national.
and
--
and
the
point
here
is
we've
got
to
of
course
read
what
congress
wrote.
what
congress
wrote
was
“
lawfully
made
under
this
title
”,
not
"lawfully
made
in
the
united
states.
"
or
not
"lawfully
made
under
this
title
and
made
in
the
united
states.
"
when
congress
wants
to
say
that,
congress
says
that
very
explicitly.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no,
your
honor.
just,
i
--
i
would
say
“
lawfully
made
under
this
title
”
means
lawfully
made
in
a
manner
that
does
not
violate
the
standards
articulated.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
give
a
--
an
example
that
actually
is
consistent
with
what--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--that
that
statute
that
you
just
described
would
only
do
a
third
of
the
job
of
the
first-sale
doctrine.
everyone
agrees
the
first-sale
doctrine
applies
at
a
minimum
to
products
made
in
the
united
states.
and
if
you
use
that
counterfactual,
if
u.s.
law
had
applied,
it
would
indicate
that
it,
the
first-sale
doctrine,
does
not
apply
in
situations
where
it
was
made
in
the
united
states.
so
the
counterfactual--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--so
the
first-sale
doctrine
applies
to
goods
made
in
the
united
states--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--and
to
goods
made
outside
of
the
united
states,
is
our
argument.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
if
it
applies
in
the
united
states,
if
we're
talking
about
goods
made
in
the
united
states,
the
counterfactual
“
if
this
title
had
applied
”
would
not
work,
because
this
title
does
apply
to
the
goods
made
in
the
united
states,
and
that's
the
core
of
the
first-sale
doctrine.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor,
if
i
may
just
change
one
word,
because
“
piratical
”
is
a
mischievous
word.
back
in
the
day
when
the
1976
statute
was
passed,
“
piratical
”
meant
unlawful
under
the
laws
of
other
countries.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes.
so--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--absolutely.
and
--
and
the
key--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--counterfeit.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
that
is
right.
and
your
honor,
the
reason
was
--
what
was
driving
copyright
owners
crazy
was
this
notion
that
there
were
lawless
states
out
there
that
had
no
significant
copyright
protection.
and
we
were
applying
their
standards
to
products
that
were
infiltrating
the
u.s.
market.
and
one
of
the
most
important
things
to
underscore
here,
which
i
think
got
lost
in
the
costco
argument,
is
that
the
space
--
that
602
does
an
enormous
amount
of
work
even
with
109,
the
first-sale
doctrine,
carved
out
of
it.
copyright
owners
wanted
three
things
out
of
the
1976
act
with
respect
to
importation,
and
they
got
two
and
a
half
of
them.
the
first
was
what
we've
just
been
talking
about,
your
honor.
it
was
driving
them
crazy
that
there
were
lawless
states
out
there;
they
gave
the
example
of
russia,
which
--
where
an
agency
approved
the
making
and
distribution
within
russia
of
classic
english
language
works.
they
got
imported
to
the
u.s.
and
they
were
competing
with
u.s.
works,
u.s.
copies
within
our
domestic
market.
and
they
got
their
wish
to
shut
that
down,
to
use
u.s.
law
as
the
standard
for
those
works.
secondly,
they
got
coverage
for
copies
that
were
lawfully
made
but
stolen.
and
this
was
the
one
ask
that
the
film
industry
had.
we
see
it
in
the
colloquies.
they
rented
films
abroad.
the
films
--
that
was
their
business
model.
the
films
would
get
stolen;
and
the
u.s.
market
would
be
awash
with
stolen
films.
and
so
they
wanted
to
shut
down
with
the
importation
provision
those
stolen
goods
coming
into
the
u.s.
market.
and
the
third
thing
that
they
wanted
is
--
is
what's
been
dominating
this
debate.
but
it's
only
the
third
thing,
and
that
was
help
dividing
geographic
markets,
so
that
they
could
go
after
the
rogue
distributors,
yes,
but
also
go
after
the
downstream
sales.
they
got
half
of
that.
they
got
a
cause
of
action
against
the
rogue
distributors.
they
did
not
get
a
cause
of
action
that
went
downstream.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
the
only
question
under
our
definition
is,
was
the
making
lawful,
which
is
to
say,
was
it
authorized,
whether
it's
by
transfer
of
licensing
or
by
transfer
of
copyright
or
in
any
other
way?
is
it
lawful
as
measured
by
u.s.
standards?
and
--
and
that--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--if--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--right.
and,
your
honor,
the
reason
that
the
language
works
the
way
we've
described
is
because
we
are
not
focusing
on
whether
the
making
was
under
this
title;
we're
focusing
on
whether
it
was
lawful
under
this
title.
does
this
--
would
this
title,
when
you
apply
it
to
wherever
it
happens
to
be,
whether
in
the
united
states
or
abroad,
would
this
title
say
that
this
is
authorized?
now,
let
me
just
circle
back
again.
the
reason
if
this
title
had
been
applicable
doesn't
work
is
because
there
are
enormous
numbers
of
situations,
probably
three-quarters
of
them,
that
the
first
sale
doctrine
applies
to
where
this
title
does
apply.
and
so
trying
to
say
where
--
you
know,
if
this
title
had
applied
would
work
for
foreign
goods
coming
in,
but
not
for
u.s.
goods,
which
is
the
core
of
the
first
sale
doctrine.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor.
and,
in
fact,
(a)(2)--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes.
in
2008--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--yes,
your
honor.
but
--
so
what
congress
did
was
to
find
a
much
simpler,
more
efficient
way
to
say
all
of
that.
in
2008,
it
figured
that
out
and
put--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
your--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--correct.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
right.
and
just
not
to
diminish
it--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--so,
justice
ginsburg,
my
answer
to
justice
breyer
was
about
why
the
language
in
109
was
changed,
that
is,
from
obtained
possession
to
lawfully
made.
and
that
was
--
what
justice
breyer
pointed
out
was
exactly
why,
because
--
and
not
to
minimize
bailees,
bailees
was
the
movie
industry
problem.
bailees
was
stealing
things
from
the
manufacturers'
loading
docks
or
from
shippers.
but
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
also
a
segment
of
the
publishing
industry
that
wanted
that
third
thing.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
no.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i
was
answering
yes
to
was
this
a
motivation
of
the
publishers.
and
if
i
misunderstood
the
question,
your
honor--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--a
motivation
for
602.
when
the
conversation
turned
to
109,
your
honor,
not
a
word
was
uttered
about
dividing
distribution
or
divided
markets.
it
was
all
about
this
problem--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well,
it
makes
perfect
sense,
your
honor.
obviously,
you
know,
the
industry,
at
least
back
in
1976,
did
not
get
everything
that
they
wanted.
what
they
got
was
a
much
more
powerful
weapon
than
a
contract.
i
mean,
a
copyright
weapon
gives
you
injunctive
relief,
gives
you
multiples
of
damages
which
you
don't
get
out
of
a
contract
remedy.
but
to
justice
breyer's
point,
because
i
think
it's
an
important
one,
when
you
go
to
the
history
--
and
i
think
you
are
right,
your
honor,
that
there
is
exactly
one
spot
in
the
drafting
history
where
the
relationship
between
602
and
109
was
discussed.
it
was
that
conversation
between
clark
and
goldman,
who
was
the
general
counsel
of
the
copyright
office.
it's
on
pages
11
to
12
of
our
reply
brief.
it's
recited
in
extensive
detail
in
the
amicus
brief
that
costco
submitted.
and
here's
what
happened.
they
got
their
importation
provision.
and
carp
says,
now,
wait
a
minute,
i
don't
get
it.
you
have
got
this
importation
provision,
and
you've
got
this
first
sale
doctrine.
they
are
at
war
with
each
other.
which
one
wins?
they
seem
to
be
agreeing
that
first
sale
wins,
but
they
realize
that
there
is
this
problem.
and
what
they
do,
the
general
counsel
of
the
copyright
office
says,
we
obviously
haven't
thought
this
through.
we
need
to
do
more
work
on
this,
says
the
librarian
of
congress.
and
the
next
thing
that
happens,
you
see
it
in
a
red
line
on
page
13
of
our
reply
brief,
is
that
for
the
first
time
in
the
drafting
history,
the
two
are
reconciled
by
making
602
subordinate
to
109,
in
exactly
the
way
that
quality
king
found
it
to
be.
so
the
copyright
owners
got
half
the
loaf.
it
may
not
have
been
the
half
that
was
more
important
to
them,
but
they
got
a
lot
more
from
the
extension
of
the
importation
provision.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
to
put
it
bluntly,
yes.
that's
my
ultimate
position.
but
i
do
think
it
can
be
reconciled
with
our
position.
let's
start
with
the
question
presented
in
quality
king
is
exactly
the
question
that
is
presented
here,
and
the
court
answered
it
yes,
that
is,
do
imports
--
is
109
applicable
to
imports.
the
whole
driving
logic
of
quality
king
is
about
109
trumping
602.
and
it's
only
in
that
part
iv,
where
the
court
is
rebutting
various
attacks
on
its
position,
that
it
gets
to
that
dictum,
and
that
dictum
is
in
the
third
tier
explanation
to
one
of
five
rebuttals.
i
believe
it
can
be
reconciled,
certainly
in
result.
what
you
had
there
was
the
foreign
distributor
who
had
only
british
rights
importing
directly
into
the
united
states.
there
was
never
a
first
sale.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
and
i
have
an
--
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
have
an
explanation.
i
offer
it
tentatively.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
right
or
not,
either
as
to
what
the
court
intended
or
under
the
statute.
my
hunch
is
the
court
was
thinking
about
a
scenario
where
the
british
publisher
only
needs
10,000
copies
to
cover
britain;
but,
instead,
what
it
does
is
to
print
100,000
copies.
everyone
would
know
that
that
is
not
authorized,
it's
not
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
because
the
intent
is
to
send
it
over
to
the
united
states.
so
it's
not
lawfully
made
at
that
moment.
let
me
also
just
mention
an
important
undergirding
to
our
position,
which
is
that
our
position
is
the
only
one
that
does
not
make
a
complete
hash
out
of
every
uses
of
the
same
phrase
--
every
use
of
the
same
phrase
in
the
rest
of
the
statute.
wiley's
reading
makes
almost
all
of
them
nonsensical.
so
let
me
just
give
you
an
example.
section
110,
the
classroom
provision.
wiley
acknowledges
this
is
the
result
but
doesn't
explain
why
congress
would
ever
have
wanted
it.
the
result
is
that
a
teacher
can
go
and
buy
a
beethoven
record
and
play
it
to
her
class
if
it
was
made
in
the
united
states.
but
if
she
flips
one
past
it
to
the
next
beethoven
record
that
happens
to
have
been
made
in
asia,
she
can't
play
that
for
her
class.
or
section
109(c),
the
public
display,
the
buffalo
cafe
owner
is
allowed
to
purchase
something
in
the
united
states
and
put
it
up
on
her
walls,
you
know,
say,
a
picture
of
niagara
falls.
that
is
permissible
if
it
was
made
in
the
united
states.
but
off
the
same
retail
rack,
she
flips
one
past;
if
it
was
made
in
asia,
it's
not
permissible.
nor
does
wiley
explain
why
congress
would
adopt
an
exception
to
the
first
sale
doctrine
that
is
not
at
all
about
sales,
that
is
only
about
where
copies
were
made.
so
a
u.s.
manufacturer
who
wants
to
sell
into
the
u.s.
market
has
this
incentive
to
go
and
send
jobs
overseas.
it's
an
irresistible
incentive
if
the
law
is
--
if
this
court
says
the
law
is
what
wiley
says.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
your
honor,
i'm
sure
it
has.
they
haven't
announced
it.
now,
let
me
just
be
clear.
the
ninth
circuit
came
out
with
its
opinion,
this
court
has
intervened
twice,
so
the
law
has
never
been
settled
in
wiley's
favor.
the
courts
were
split.
the
moment
that
a
manufacturer
learns
that
this
court
says
you
get
what
we've
called
the
holy
grail
of
manufacturing,
endless
eternal
downstream
control
over
sales
and
rentals,
you
can
ruin
secondary
markets
that
are
competing
with
you,
the
moment
that
happens,
that
will
be
yet
another
reason
for
manufacturers
silently
to
decide
that
they're
headed
--
that
they're
sending
their
manufacturing
overseas.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
well,
your
honor,
there
are
only
three
courts
of
appeals
that
have
weighed
in,
but
yes,
the
second
circuit
is
the
only
one
that
has
adopted
the
absolutist
rule,
and
that's
yet
another
problem
with
wiley's
position.
wiley
urges
its
position
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
is
refusing
to
stand
by
it.
the
moment
it
gets
past
the
language
of
the
statute,
every
argument
it
makes
is
an
argument
that
is
about
tempering
what
--
you
know,
like
a
sky
hook
coming
down
from
on
high,
tempering
its
interpretation
in
a
manner
that
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
language.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
yes,
your
honor,
which
--
which
is
even
--
creates
even
more
mischief.
the
government's
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
109
doesn't
have
to
do
any
work.
in
service
of
giving
more
berth,
you
know,
greater
magnitude
to
602,
we're
going
to
make
109
completely
superfluous
because
bobbs-merrill
does
all
of
the
work.
now,
109
congress
said
--
it
put
into
the
statute,
it
said
it
on
every
recodification
to
codify
bobbs-merrill,
and
the
government
is
now
making
109
completely
irrelevant,
but
picking
and
choosing,
deciding
that
it
wants
the
limitation
on
us
from
109,
but
borrowing
from
bobbs-merrill
some
reservoir
of
law
that
modifies
the
first-sale
doctrine.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like--
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
--well
--
so
first,
your
honor,
back
in
1976,
this
notion
of
geographic
division
was
very,
very
new,
so
it's
not
at
all
clear
what
congress
was
thinking
with
that
--
with
respect
to
that.
but
secondly,
no,
we're
not
--
we're
not
saying
that
when
the
owner
sells
his
chinese
--
its
chinese
rights
to
the
chinese
company,
it
is
selling
all
rights.
certainly,
the
chinese
company
cannot
sell
everywhere,
but
after
that
first
sale,
all
of
the
manufacturer's
rights
are
cut
off.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
e.
joshua
rosenkranz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
want
to
step
back
and
take
a
look
at
what
the
government's
doing
here.
after
eloquently
arguing
in
quality
king
in
the
last
two
pages
of
its
brief
that
our
position
on
the
meaning
of
this
language
is
right,
it's
saying
our
position
is
wrong.
and
then,
it's
trying
to
come
up
with
a
middle
ground
that
has
absolutely
no
basis
in
the
statute.
if
bobbs-merrill
provides
the
content
for
the
first
sale
doctrine,
then
what
does
section
109
do?
and
so
the
government
is
creating
a
scenario
in
which,
in
order
to
save
602
from
being
superfluous
in
the
way
it
is
described,
although
we
believe
it's
not
superfluous
at
all,
it
is
making
109
superfluous.
justice
kagan
asked
a
question
about
essentially
sentence
diagramming.
our
view
is
that
under
this
title
modifies
lawfully.
you
use
the
u.s.
metric
of
u.s.
law
to
figure
out
whether
it's
lawful.
the
government's
and
wiley's
position
is
that
under
this
title
modifies
both
made
and
lawfully.
and
at
least
the
way
i
learned
grammar,
you
can't
use
the
same
phrase
to
modify
both
terms.
i
want
to
correct
something
that
i
said
to
justice
ginsburg
because
i
said
it
backwards.
905
and
906
are
examples
of
the
united
states
congress
in
a
copyright
context
applying
national
exhaustion,
and
that
was
six
years
after
this
statute
was
passed.
to
justice
breyer's
question,
the
bear
is
there.
it
is
very
much
there.
the
only
reason
no
one
has
ever
pursued
these
legal
arguments
is
that
the
legal
arguments
that
are
the
baseline
for
all
of
this
have
yet
to
be
accepted
by
this
court.
but
i
have
not
heard
any
argument
for
why
the
vast
majority
of
them
will
not
necessarily
obtain,
and
they
are
not
in
any
of
the
briefs.
to
use
the
toyota
example,
there
simply
is
no
other
defense.
there
is
none.
fair
use
doesn't
apply
to
the
vast
majority
of
the
scenarios
that
i've
just
described.
finally,
outsourcing:
congress
did
not
want
u.s.
jobs
to
go
overseas.
congress
in
the
very
same
statute
in
section
601
was
hoarding
manufacturing
jobs
to
the
united
states;
and
as
the
government
said
on
the
last
page
of
its
quality
king,
"it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
same
congress
that
hoarded
jobs
in
the
united
states
was
prepared
to
tolerate
a
situation
in
which
there
was
eternal
downstream
control.
"
that
the
copyright
owners
would
be
encouraged
to
seize
by
sending
jobs
overseas.
so
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court
--
i
saw,
i
just
realized
i
said
the
same
thing
twice
incorrectly
to
justice
ginsburg.
905
and
906
are
examples
of
international
exhaustion.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court
and
respectfully
request
that
the
court
reverse
the
judgment
below.
