justice
elena
kagan
so,
mr.
rosenkranz,
is
what
--
is
your
theory
of
this
statute
essentially
that
this
language
means
nonpiratical
copies
as
that
is
defined
by
u.s.
copyright
law?
justice
elena
kagan
no.
justice
elena
kagan
i
said
as
defined
by
u.s.
copyright
law.
justice
elena
kagan
so
that's,
that's
what
the
statute
means.
it's
--
the
statute
in
your
view
is
setting
up
a
distinction
between
piratical,
pirated,
whatever
the
term
is
--
copies--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
other
copies,
and
saying
that
that
distinction
should
be
measured
by
u.s.
copyright
law?
justice
elena
kagan
but
a
motivation
for
109,
or
a
motivation
for
602?
justice
elena
kagan
so
on
602,
you
said
that
one
of
the
things
that
they
wanted
was
the
segmentation
of
markets.
they
got
half
of
it.
they
got
the
rogue
distributors'
half.
and
i
guess
mr.
olson
makes
the
point,
and
it
seems
a
good
one,
it's
like
that's
a
crazy
half
to
have
gotten.
that's
the
kind
that
they
don't
need
because
they
have
a
contractual
remedy
about
--
against
the
distributors.
and
then
they
don't
get
people
like,
frankly,
your
client,
who
are
rogue
something
elses,
with
no
contractual
privity.
and
what
sense
does
that
make?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rosenkranz,
there
is
that
passage
in
quality
king,
which
is,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say,
unfortunate
to
your
position.
is
your
basic
view
of
that
passage
that
it
was
simply
ill-considered
dicta
that
we
should
ignore?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
in
result,
but
not
in
reasoning.
the
passage
specifically
says
this
was
presumably
not
to
be
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rosenkranz,
can
i
take
you
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
opening
question?
just
as
a
matter
of
copyright
theory,
i
had
always
understood
copyright
to
--
a
copyright
holder
has
a
kind
of
a
bundle
of
rights.
it's
not
one
right
that
applies
everywhere
in
the
world.
it's
you
have
your
u.s.
rights
and
you
have
your
chinese
rights,
you
have
your
rights
under
each
jurisdiction's
law.
and
your
position
is
essentially
to
say
that
when
i
sell
my
chinese
rights
to
somebody,
i'm
also
selling
my
u.s.
rights
to
that
same
person,
because
the
person
who
has
the
chinese
rights
can
just
turn
around
and
import
the
goods.
i
mean,
that's
the
nature
of
your
position,
isn't
it,
that
your
u.s.
rights
are
always
attached
when
you
sell
more
--
your
rights
under
the
jurisdiction
of
another
country?
justice
elena
kagan
it
wasn't
necessary,
was
it?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
olson,
can
i
just
take
you
to--
justice
elena
kagan
--please.
justice
elena
kagan
can
i
take
you
back
to
the
words
here,
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
which
you
say
clearly
means
what
you
say
it
means.
so,
i
find
this
language
a
little
bit
perplexing,
and
i
can
kind
of
see
it
both
ways.
so
what
you
say
is
made
under
this
title,
that
must
mean
made
in
the
united
states,
and
lawfully,
just
as
this
little
word
that's
--
that
modifies
that
basic
phrase,
made
under
this
title,
which
means
made
in
the
united
states.
but
what
mr.
rosenkranz
essentially
says
--
he
doesn't
say
it
in
these
words,
but
he
says,
"the
focus
of
this
provision
is
on
“
lawfully
made
”.
"
that
is
what
the
focus
is
on.
it's
on
lawfully
made
as
opposed
to
unlawfully
made.
now,
when
we
just
say
lawfully
made,
you
know,
we
need
something
to
measure,
well,
how
do
we
know
whether
it's
lawfully
made?
well,
you
look
to
the
rules
in
the
copyright
law.
so
if
you
just
--
if
you
focus
more
on
the
lawfully
word,
lawfully
made,
and
then
under
this
title
doesn't
mean
made
in
the
united
states,
it
means
lawfully
made
under
the
rules
of
this
title.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
lawfully
made,
under
the
rules
of
the
united
states,
regardless
where
the
thing
was
manufactured,
is
what
i'm
saying.
that's
the
way
--
it
just
seems
to
me
as
though--
justice
elena
kagan
--you
are
saying
made
must
be
manufactured.
but
lawfully
made
is
a
lawfully
made
copy.
how
do
we
know
if
it's
lawfully
made?
we
look
to
this
title.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
intending
where?
i
mean,
i
--
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
the
legislative
history
and
the
purposes
behind
602.
but
the
language
that
we're
supposed
to
be
interpreting
is
the
language
in
section
109.
and
the
language
in
section
109,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
there's
really
nothing
to
support
your
argument
that
that
language
was
intended
to
address
this
gray
market
problem.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
know,
section
109
is
just
a
rewording
of
a
prior
provision
that
you
would
clearly
lose
under,
where
the
prior
wording
had
nothing
to
do
with
where
any
product
was
manufactured.
and
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
we
should
read
this
change
in
wording
--
which
actually,
there's
a
real
theory
behind
what
the
change
in
wording
meant
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
place
of
manufacture,
that
we
should
read
it
as
incorporating
a
place
of
manufacture
requirement,
because
there
was
a
separate
debate
going
on
in
section
602
about
that
question.
justice
elena
kagan
so
mr.
stewart,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
both
here
and
in
quality
king
you
want
the
copyright
holder
to
have
some
control
over
importation,
but
at
the
same
time
you
don't
want
the
copyright
holder
to
have
control
over
all
downstream
sales.
justice
elena
kagan
and
that's
what
your
bobbs-merrill
argument
is
designed
to
do.
it's
designed
to
prevent
that.
justice
elena
kagan
coming
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
do
you
think
that
truly
the
way
to
do
those
two
things,
to
give
the
copyright
holder
control
over
importation
but
not
over
downstream
sales,
that
our
problem
really
is,
do
you
think
in
your
heart
of
hearts
that
we
got
it
wrong
in
quality
king?
justice
elena
kagan
so
you
are
essentially
saying
that
the
appropriate
way
to
read
this
statute,
to
make
sense
of
all
of
its
provisions,
is
to
give
the
copyright
holder
control
over
the
importation,
to
give
wiley
the
ability
to
go
after
this
importer,
mr.
kirtsaeng,
but
to
find
a
way
to
stop
it
there.
