well,
it
may
be
important
dictum,
but
do
you
really
want
to
argue
it
wasn't
dictum?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
was
the
holding
of
the
case?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you're
saying
bobbs-merrill
means
something
beyond
section
109,
but
when
--
the
1909
copyright
act
said
that
it
was
codifying
the
holding
in
bobbs-merrill,
and
the
1976
statute
which
is
now
before
us
said
it
wasn't
changing
the
meaning
of
the
earlier
law.
so
i
don't
know
how
--
bobbs-merrill
wasn't
a
constitutional
decision,
it
was
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
so
how
does
some
sliver
of
bobbs-merrill
still
survive
all
of
this?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
of
the
following
is
worse:
all
of
the
horribles
that
the
petitioner
outlines
to
the
extent
they
are
realistic,
or
the
frustration
of
market
segmentation,
to
the
extent
that
would
occur,
if
petitioner's
position
were
accepted?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
the
--
if
that
middle
ground
is
--
were
found
to
be
not
viable,
which
of
the
two
sets
of
consequences
is
worse
from
the
government's
perspective,
or
can
you
not
say?
