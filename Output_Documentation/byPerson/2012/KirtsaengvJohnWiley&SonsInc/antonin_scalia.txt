do
you
mean
by
“
lawfully
made
under
this
title
”,
simply
lawfully
made
in
a
manner
that
does
not
violate
united

the
standards,
okay.
so
--
so
it
could
be
lawfully
made
in
england,
let's
say;
in
a
country
that
has
compulsory
licensing,
it
could
be
lawfully
made
there,
but
it
would
not
be
lawfully
made
under
our
--
under
our
copyright
law,
because
we
don't
have
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
--
so
at
least
they
are
correct
in
contending
that
what
you
are
arguing
for
is
--
is
not
lawfully
made
under
--
lawfully
made
if
the
united
states
copyright
law
had
applied
where
it
was
made;
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
--
of
those
--
of
those
courts
that
did
hold
the
way
your
--
your
opponent
would
--
would
have
it,
am
i
correct
that
only
one
of
them
adopted
the
absolutist
rule?
