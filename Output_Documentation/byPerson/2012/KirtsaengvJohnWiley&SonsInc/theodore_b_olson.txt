mr.
theodore
b.
olson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
commercial
enterprise
is
precisely
what
section
602(a)(1)
was
enacted
to
address,
an
international
gray
market
in
copyrighted
works.
this
court
unanimously
recognized
in
the
quality
king
case
that
602(a)(1)
encompasses
copies
of
books
that
were
lawfully
made
not
under
the
united
states'
copyright
act,
but
under
the
law
of
some
other
country.
602(a)
is
broader
than
6
--
109(a),
because
it
encompasses
copies
not
subject
to
the
first-sale
doctrine,
for
example
copies
made
under
the
law
of
another
country.
these
are
the
words
of
every
member
of
this
court
in
the
quality
king
case.
now,
referring
to
it
as
dicta
misstates
what
was
going
on,
on
the
quality
king
case.
the
argument
was
that
if
you
interpret
602(a)
and
109(a)
as
allowing
a
defense,
a
first-sale
defense,
you
emasculate
section
602(a),
and
so
the
court
was
explaining
on
page
147
and
148,
i
believe,
why
there
were
three
reasons
why
602(a)
would
have
viability.
and
one
of
those
reasons
had
to
do
with
direct
action
against
someone
that
was
engaged
in
pirating,
and
some
of
it
had
to
do
with
bailees
and
lessees.
these
are
relatively
small
problems
either
otherwise
dealt
with
by
contract
law
or
otherwise
dealt
with
by
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
but
the
third
reason
for
the
court's
interpretation
and
its
decision
in
that
case
was
precisely
the
case
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
i
do.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
it
was
the
holding
of
the
case
in
the
sense
that
it
was
necessary,
the
court
felt.
and
we
could
--
you
know,
i
don't
--
i
don't
feel
i
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
arguing
what
the
word
“
dicta
”
means,
but
it
was
a
necessary
ingredient
to
what
the
court
felt
was
an
explanation
for
why
it
was
deciding
the
case
that
it
was
deciding.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
we're
--
well,
if
we're
reading
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
is
that
copy
--
now,
there
are
exceptions
for
the
books
that
are
brought
in--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
there
are
fair
use
exceptions
and
there's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--other
exceptions
and
--
and
there
are
exceptions
for
the
one
that
you
bring
back
for
your
wife
and
your--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
says--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
provisions
in
the
statute
that
deal
with
the
libraries
talk
about
bringing
--
importing
books
for
lending--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--for
lending
purposes.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
what
i'm
--
what
i'm--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--with
respect
to
the
copy
brought
in,
in
the
suitcase
for
--
to
give
to
a
--
a
family
member
or
to
turn
over
to
someone
else?
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
oh,
to
keep
for
yourself--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--what
--
i
believe
that
that
is
covered
by
the
various
provisions
of
the
copyright
statute.
and
the
question
is,
is
it
covered
by
section
2
--
602(a)(1)?
yes,
it's
an
import
of
an
acquired
copy.
do
you
have
a
defense
under
the
first-sale
doctrine?
and
i
go
to
the
exact
explicit
language
of
the
statute.
there
may
be
exceptions
under
other
provisions
of
the
copyright
law,
but
the
first-sale
doctrine,
109(a)
specifically
says
“
lawfully
made
under
this
title
”.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
and
this--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
may
be--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
may
be
just--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--there
are
other
defenses,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
is
not--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
government
--
the
government
would
argue
for
a
broader
interpretation
under
what
was
made
under
this
statute,
whether
that
would
include
the
importation
or
the
distribution
in
commerce.
that's
an
argument
that
the
government
makes,
but
it's
not
necessary
to
decide
this
case.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
well,
i'm
--
first
of
all,
i
would
say
that
when
we
talk
about
all
the
horribles
that
might
apply
in
cases
other
than
this
--
museums,
used
toyotas,
books
and
luggage,
and
that
sort
of
thing
--
we're
not
talking
about
this
case.
and
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
language
used
by
the
statute
that
does
apply
to
this
case.
and
that--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
and
that's--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--and
--
exactly,
justice
kennedy.
and
that's
what
you
were
doing
in
the
--
in
the
quality
king,
when
we
were
--
we
were
discussing
with
justice
alito
whether
this
is
dicta
or
not.
the
court
was
specifically
saying
what
it
would
apply
to,
and
it
--
what
--
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
that
case
was
books
made
not
pursuant
to
title,
but
pursuant
to
some
other
country's
copyright
law.
this
copyright
law
provisions--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
if
he
is
doing
--
if
he
is
manufacturing
the
book
in
england,
he's
not
--
because
the
copyright
law
does
not
have
extraterritorial
application,
he
is
not
making
those
copies
under
this
title.
and
this
court--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--but
the
problem
is
--
the
statutes
may
not
be
perfect
with
respect
to
this,
and
there
may
be
horribles
that
occur
under
one
set
of
interpretations
of
the
statute,
and
the
other
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
to
interpret
it
as
--
as
the
petitioner--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
--
there
--
there
is
a
body
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
that
is
entitled
and
capable
of
fixing
this.
these
parade
of
horribles
have
been
--
people
have
been
arguing
about
these
for
years.
for
30
years,
the
statute
has
been
interpreted
the
way
that
we
are
suggesting
that
it
should
be
under
this
title,
which
this
court
earlier
this
year,
in
another
case,
in
the
novo
nordisk
case,
specifically
said,
under
this
title
means
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
title.
this
court
said
that
before
in
--
in
the
ardestani
case.
the
under
this
title
occurs
not
only
in
section
109(a),
but
under
this
title
occurs
in
602(a)
itself;
and
then
under
this
section
appears
twice
in
section
602(a)--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--yes,
and
--
and
in
each
case
--
first
of
all,
if
the
interpretation
that
my
opponent
is
arguing
for
was
the
law,
that
--
those
are
the
words
that
are
in
602(b)
and
602(a)(2).
so
congress
could
have
used
those
words
that
our
opponents
are
arguing
for,
and
did
use
those
words,
one
of
which
was
written
on
the
same
time
in
the
same
--
passed
in
the
same
time,
in
1976,
that
602(a)(1)
was.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
with
respect
to
those
other--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--with
respect
to
those
other
provisions,
justice
ginsburg,
the
--
the
government
specifically
goes
over
each
one
of
those,
but
each
one
of
those,
if
you
interpret
the
statute
as
under
this
title
as
pursuant
to
this
title,
each
one
of
those
provisions
makes
sense
in
the
context
in
which
that
term
is
used
there.
and
--
and
there
is
only
one
real
way
to
interpret
under
this
title
in
the
provisions
in
109(a)
in
--
in
conjunction
with
602(a)(1),
and
that
is
the
way
the
court
decided
it
in
the
quality
king
case,
specifically
looking
at
this
question.
now
the
facts
were
slightly
different
in
the
sense
that
that
was
a
round
trip;
this
isn't
a
round
trip.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
lawfully
made
under
this
title
is
lawfully
made
under
the
copyright
laws
of
the
united
states.
it
can't
say,
lawfully
made
in
the
united
states,
because
then
something
might--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--i
think
under
this
title
means
that
it
was
made
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
copyright
law.
i
can't
imagine
the
difficulties
that
would
ensue
with
litigation
over
whether
or
not
something
made
in
another
country,
made
under
another
country's
different
laws
--
and
they
vary
enormously
throughout
the
world
--
whether
that
was
somehow
compatible
with
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
because
the--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--the
main
--
main--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
each
one
of
those
situations
that
you
posit,
justice
breyer,
has
a
whole
panoply
of
set
of
facts.
with
respect
to
the
museums,
with
respect
to
the
person
bringing
books
into
the
united
states,
there
are
other
defenses,
including
fair
use.
there
are
other
defenses
under
the
copyright
law.
but
--
and
one
of
the
things
is
that,
to
a
certain
extent,
if
you're
going
to
use
the
product
created
by
someone
else
in
a
way
that's
contemplated
by
the
copyright
laws,
maybe
it's
required
that
you
actually
comply
with
the
copyright
laws
by
going
to
the
owner
of
the
copyright
and
saying,
look,
here's
what
i
propose
to
do,
can
i
have
a
license
to
do
this?
it's
a
nonprofit.
it's
a
museum.
and
i'm--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--no.
and
some
of
--
but
--
but
they're--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--it
may
be
a
fair
use.
it
may
be
an
implied
license,
for
example,
with
respect
to
copyrighted
items
or
trademarked
items
that
appear
in
a
product
that
was
licensed
abroad.
the
government
has
offered
another
alternative
interpretation
of
the
word
“
made
”,
as
putting
it
in
the
flow
of
commerce.
that
might
deal
with
some
of
these
situations.
but
the
point
i
guess
i
am
making,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
congress
was
clearly
intending
to
talk
about
the
vast
gray
market
problem.
this
provision--
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
--well,
no.
i
think
that
section
109
and
602(a)
were
adopted
in
the
same
statute.
they
were
put
in
the
draft
of
the
statute
at
the
same
time,
in
1964.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
but
the
two
pro
--
what
i'm
--
i
guess
what
i'm
trying
to
explain
is
that
the
two
were
enacted
at
the
same
time.
they
were
out
there
and
available
to
the
public
for
12
years
before
they
were
finally
adopted.
these
parade
of
horribles
could
have
been
addressed
by
congress
in
a
different
way
at
the
time,
and
the
interpretation
--
this
is
a
--
109
is
a
defense
--
is
offered
as
a
defense
to
section
--
to
section
602(a)(1).
so
what
does
it
mean?
what
provide
--
what
is
the
defense
that's
provided?
and
you
then
have
to
interpret,
“
made
under
this
”
--
“
lawfully
made
under
this
title
”.
what
does
that
mean?
and
you
have
done
that
in
the
quality
king
case.
you
explained
in
the
quality
king
unanimously
that
it
makes
a
difference
because
you
are
--
exhausting
--
congress
intended
to
allow
segmentation
of
the
market.
it
only
makes
sense
to
interpret
it
this
way
if
you
allow
segmentation
of
the
market
pursuant
to
these
provisions,
because
it
is
exhausting
the
copyright
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
once
you
make
a
sale
of
a
product
produced
in
the
united
states
subject
to
the
united
states'
copyright
laws.
you
are
not
exhausting
your
u.s.
copyright
when
you
make
something,
or
allow
something
to
be
made
abroad.
you
are
not
exhausting
that
copyright.
you
have
not
done
that
yet.
so
the
first
sale
is
not
something
that
happens
abroad
that
uses
up
the
copyright
laws
--
of
the
protection
under
the
copyright
laws
of
the
united
states.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
this
does
make
perfect
sense.
and
it
makes
--
there
is
not
going
to
be
a
perfect
solution
in
every
case.
the
court
has
dealt
with
that
frequently
with
respect
to
copyright
laws.
but
if
you
interpret
it
as
my
opponent
interprets
it,
you
are
opening
the
door
to
commercial
enterprises
precisely
like
this.
it's
not
necessary
in
this
case
to
decide
every
single
permutation
of
a
problem
that
someone
crosses
a
border
with
a
product,
but
this
section
602
specifically
contemplates
products
that
are
acquired
abroad
and
then
brought
back
into
the
united
states.
here,
we
have
a
commercial
enterprise
doing
exactly
what
is
contemplated
by
the
people
who
were
talking
about
602(a)
and
section
109
when
the
two
were
adopted
at
the
same
time.
mr.
theodore
b.
olson
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
one,
that's
congress's
concern.
and
--
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
would
really
actually
happen.
and
congress
was
concerned
with
creating
a
segmentation
of
the
market.
but
it's
entirely
speculative
as
to
whether
or
not
people
are
going
to
start
manufacturing
books
or
other
items
outside
the
united
states.
congress
can
address
that
if
that
should
become
a
problem,
but
it's
not
something
that
was
suggested
as
a
part
of
what
was
taking
place
at
that
time.
