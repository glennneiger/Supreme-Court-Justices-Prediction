mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
discuss
--
begin
by
discussing
our
bobbs-merrill
argument,
because
it's
a
part
of
our
brief
that's
different
from
both
the
parties'
submissions,
and
i
do
think
it's
very
important
to
understanding
the
practical
implications
of
the
court's
decision.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
there
are
two
related
reasons,
and
one
of
them
is
the
dictum,
but
i'll
get
to
that
second.
i
think
in
both
cases,
our
overriding
objective
was
to
offer
a
reading
of
section
109(a)
that
would
not
supersede,
or
would
not
effectively
negate
the
implication
prohibition
in
section
602(a)(1),
because
from
the
copyright
office's
perspective,
we
agree
with
mr.
olson
that
the
primary
reason
for
the
enactment
of
602(a)(1)
was
to
facilitate
market
segmentation.
and
the
argument
we
made
in
quality
king
was
you
can
accomplish
that;
you
can
prevent
section
109(a)--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
best
thing
i
could
point
to
is
a
report
of
the
registrar
of
copyrights
that
was
issued
in
1965,
in
which
the
copyright
office
identified
as
one
of
the
circumstances
that
would
be
covered
by
the
importation
ban,
the
situation
in
which,
quote,
"the
copyright
owner
had
authorized
the
manufacture
of
copies
in
a
foreign
country
for
distribution
only
in
that
country.
"
it
didn't
use
the
phrase
“
market
segmentation
”,
but
clearly,
the
point
was
the
same.
you
are
authorizing
copies
to
be
made
abroad
for
distribution
only
in
that
place,
not
for
redistribution
here.
and
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
we
lost
that
case
9-0,
and
so
i
am
not
arguing
too
vociferously
that
the
court
should
change
its
opinion.
but
yes,
we
think
that
we
still
would
adhere
to
our
view
that
section
109(a)
should
not
be
read
as
a
limitation
on
section
602(a)(1).
if
the
court
had
gone
that
path,
it
could
read
“
lawfully
made
under
this
title
”
to
encompass
both
foreign-made
and
domestic-made
copies,
without
doing
damage
to
the
copyright
holder's
ability
to
segment
markets.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we're
not
urging
the
court
to
take
that
course,
but
yes,
that
would
have
been
one
way
to
accomplish
the
same
objective.
and
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
think
our
bobbs-merrill
argument
does
provide
a
very
principled
way
to
stop
it
there
without
going
back
on
what
the
court
said
in
quality
king.
that
is,
bobbs-merrill
was
a
1908
case
in
which
the
publisher
sold
books
to
retailers
on
the
proviso
that
they
not
be
sold
at
retail
for
less
than
a
specified
amount.
one
of
the
retailers
violated
that
resale
restriction
and
was
sued
for
copyright
infringement.
and
this
court
in
bobbs-merrill
said
--
parsed
the
statutory
language,
which
at
that
time
gave
the
copyright
owner
the
exclusive
right
to
vend
copies
of
the
work.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
maybe
i
can
put
it
this
way:
if
i
buy
a
piratical
copy
of
a
book,
one
that
was
illegally
made
without
the
consent
of
the
copyright
owner,
and
all
i
do
is
read
it
and
put
it
on
my
shelf,
i
can't
rely
on
109(a)
because
the
copy
was
not
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
but
i
still
couldn't
be
held
liable
for
copyright
infringement
because
there
is
no
exclusive
right
to
read
the
book
or
to
own
it.
i
wouldn't
have
been
infringing
any
of
the
copyright
owner's
rights.
and
so
in
order
to
have
a
valid
claim
for
copyright
infringement,
the
copyright
holder
would
have
to
show
both
that
109(a)
was
inapplicable,
and
that
what
the
defendant
was
doing
was
a
violation,
an
infringement
of
one
of
the
exclusive
rights.
and
mr.
rosenkranz
seems
to
postulate
a
situation
in
which
a
cagey
manufacturer
would
locate
its
facilities
overseas,
make
the
copies
there,
import
them
into
the
united
states,
sell
them
in
this
country,
subject
to
conditions
on
resale.
and
if
the
goods
were
resold
in
violation
of
those
restrictions,
the
copyright
owner
would
sue
for
infringement.
and
i
think
the
first
argument
the
defendant
would
make
is
that
is
exactly
the
conduct
that
the
court
in
bobbs-merrill
said
did
not
infringe
the
exclusive
right
to
vend.
now
--
namely
the
resale
in
violation
of
restrictions
on
resale.
how
can
you
now
say
it's
now
an
infringement
of
the
exclusive
right
to
distribute?
and
it
would
be
a
particularly
difficult
argument
for
the
copyright
owner
to
make
because
what
the
house
report
said
in
1909,
it
didn't
say
exactly
that
it
was
codifying
the
holding
of
bobbs-merrill;
it
said
that
it
was
amending
the
statute
in
other
respects,
and
it
wanted
to
make
clear
that
there
was
no
intent
to
enlarge
the
exclusive
right
to
vend.
and
so
the
plaintiff,
in
mr.
rosenkranz's
hypothetical,
would
in
effect
be
arguing
that
by
codifying
section
109(a),
congress
had
implicitly
expanded
the
scope
of
the
implicit
--
of
the
exclusive
right
to
vend
or
distribute,
even
though
it
said
it
was
doing
the
various
opposite.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
i
think
that
would
be
true
under
anybody's
reading.
that
is,
once
a
court
in
a
case
determined
for
whatever
reason
that
section
109(a)
was
inapplicable,
it
didn't
provide
a
safe
harbor,
the
next
step
could
never
be
simply
to
proceed
to
judgment
and
say
that
there
was
infringement.
the
next
step
would
always
have
to
be
to
look
at
what
the
defendant
had
done--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
other
point
i
would
make
about
the
petitioner's
approach
is
that
it
--
it
really
has
no
grounding
in
the
statutory
text.
that
is,
the
petitioner
is
arguing
that
if
the
publisher
in
thailand,
if
the
manufacturer
of
the
books
had
shipped
them
directly
into
this
country,
that
person
could
have
been
sued
for
infringement
for
the
importation
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
--
i
give
two
answers
for
that.
and
the
first
is
that
coke
was
saying
that,
in
most
circumstances
at
least,
a
sale
is
sufficient
in
order
to
divest
the
owner
of
his
prior
right
to
control
distribution,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
a
sale
is
necessary.
and
my
point
is
that
when
mr.
rosenkranz
says
the
hypothetical
foreign
publisher
who
makes
copies
with
authorization
but
ships
it
into
the
--
them
into
the
united
states
without
could
be
held
liable
for
infringement,
there
is
nothing
in
section
109(a)
that
would
allow
a
court
to
draw
that
distinction;
that
is,
although
109(a)
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
codification
of
the
first
sale
doctrine,
it
doesn't
require
an
antecedent
first
sale.
so
as
long
as
the
foreign
publisher
was
the
owner
of
the
books
at
the
type
--
time
they
were
manufactured,
if
those
books
were
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
under
petitioner's
reading
they
could
be
imported
and
distributed.
we
know
also
that
this
was
not
an
oversight,
that
congress
didn't
intend
the
provision
to
be
subject
to
a
sort
of
implicit
first
authorized
sale
requirement,
because
the
language
was
intended
to
cover
copies
that
were
made
pursuant
to
a
compulsory
license.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
if
they
actually
happened,
then
i
think
the
--
the
horribles
would
be
worse.
but,
as
i
say,
we
--
we
feel
that
we
have
offered
a
reading
of
all
the
statutory
provisions
together
that
would
avoid
both.
the
other
couple
of
things
i
would
say
as
to
why
a
first
sale
by
itself--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
would
say
that
the
consequence
that
all
foreign-made
goods,
even
if
imported
into
the
united
states
with
the
authorization
of
the
u.s.
copyright
owner,
are
subject
to
continuing
licensing
requirements,
etc.
,
i
would
say
that
would
be
worse
than
the
frustration
of
market
segmentation
that
would
occur
under
petitioner's
view.
