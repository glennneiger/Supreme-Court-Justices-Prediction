we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-696
--
697,
kirtsaeng
v.
john
wiley
&
sons.
mr.
rosenkranz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
olson.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
you
said
there
are
other
defenses,
including
fair
use.
in
--
in
the
catalogue
that
justice
breyer
recited,
are
all
those
fair
uses?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
which
ones
are
--
i
mean,
i'm
--
it
seems
unlikely
to
me
that,
if
your
position
is
right,
that
a
court
would
say,
it's
a
fair
use
to
resell
the
toyota,
it's
a
fair
use
to
display
the
picasso.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
olson.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
an
awfully
difficult
maze
for
somebody
to
--
to
get
through.
you
have
to
start
with
the
difficulty
of
the
language
here,
and
then
you
have
to
proceed
and
put
the
quality
king
gloss
over
it;
and,
when
you
finally
get
to
that
point,
you
say,
well,
now
you've
got
to
read
bobbs-merrill
and
figure
out
how
the
common
law
governs
all
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
not
that
complicated
under
the
petitioner's
approach.
it
says
once
you've
you
had
a
first
sale,
that's
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rosenkranz,
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
this
morning.
