but
your
reading
--
your
reading
is
essentially,
once
a
copy
is
sold
anywhere,
the
copyright
owner
loses
control
of
distribution
everywhere.
that
is
essentially
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
--
but
--
so
this
notion
of
sold
anywhere,
end
of
distribution
rights
everywhere,
that
has
been
called,
i
think,
the
universal
exhaustion
principle.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
are
told
that
no
country
has
adopted
that
international
exhaustion
regime,
that
most
countries
adhere
to
the
national
exhaustion
regime,
which
nobody
is
contesting
here.
that
is,
if
it's
manufactured
in
the
united
states
and
sold
in
the
united
states,
that
copy
belongs
to
the
person
who
purchased
it,
end
of
case.
but
if
the
exhaustion
doctrine
applies
only
nationally,
then
your
argument
is
asking
for
something
that
runs
against
the
regime
that
is
accepted
in
most
places.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take,
for
example,
the
european
union,
the
position
in
--
in
those
countries.
suppose
we
--
we
just
transformed
--
transferred
this
case
to
one
of
those
countries,
the
exact
same
case;
and
my
understanding
is
that
they
would
follow
the
national
exhaustion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
not
--
not
exhaust
--
you
sell
a
copy
in
--
in
thailand;
then
it's
home
free
all
over
the
world.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
they
give
all
rights
--
wasn't
there
also
the
question
of
allowing
manufacturers
to
segment
markets
so
we'd
have
the
copyright
by
abroad,
governed
by
foreign
law,
copyright
in
the
united
states
governed
by
u.s.
law?
wasn't
segmentation
of
the
market
allowing
people
to
do
just
what
these
people
are
doing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
has
that
ever
happened?
i
mean,
the
ninth
circuit
cases
have
been
around
for
some
time.
has
any
manufacturer
ever
moved
abroad?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenkranz
told
us
that
under
this
title
means
different
things
in
other
sections,
and
he
gave
a
number
of
examples.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
olson,
do
you
have
an
answer
to
the
outsourcing
problem
and
the
charges
that
if
you
read
the
statute
as
you
are
urging,
then
you
are
inviting
the
outsourcing
of
manufacturing
jobs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question.
in
quality
king
the
government
took
the
position
that
the
petitioner
is
taking
here.
what
led
the
government
to
change
its
mind?
was
it
just
what
has
been
called
dictum
in
quality
king,
or
is
there
another
reason
why
the
government
has
switched
sides?
