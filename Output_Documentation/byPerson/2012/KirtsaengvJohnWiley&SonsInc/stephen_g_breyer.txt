justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
don't
have
to
say
--
you
can
say
both,
either
it
was
manufactured
directly
and
received
an
american
copyright
and
satisfied
all
the
conditions,
or,
if
that
wasn't
the
case,
it
was
manufactured
in
a
way
that
satisfied
the
conditions
of
the
american
statute,
even
though,
for
technical
reasons,
it
didn't
apply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
your
argument
is,
i
take
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
are
off
on
a
kind
of
curly
cue
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
took
it
that
the
reason
they
wrote
--
or
changed
the
statute
was
just
because
they
were
worried
about
bailees
or
lessees
or
somebody
under
the
old
statutes
not
satisfying
the
first
--
they
were
worried
about
that
--
somebody
--
a
printer
lawfully
obtains
a
book,
and
he
shouldn't
have
advantage
of
the
first
sale
doctrine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he's
in
the
middle
of
printing
it.
and
therefore
you
have
to
change
the
language.
so
they
changed
the
language
to
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right;
or,
if
i
am
wrong,
why
did
they
change
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
couldn't
find
a
word.
i
could
not
find
a
word
of
that
in
the
legislative
history.
irvin
carp,
who
was
the
strongest
representative
for
the
publishers,
said
you
couldn't
do
that
ten
years
earlier.
so
is
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
but
you
just
said
yes
in
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question.
so
she'll
find
exactly
what
there
is
there,
so
i
would
like
to
know
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
need
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
--
602(a)
has
plenty
of
meaning.
i
mean,
an
american
copyright
holder
licenses
a
british
company
to
publish
the
work
under
british
copyright
law.
602(a)
says
he
can't
import
the
books
into
the
united
states,
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
the
only
--
so
there's
plenty
of
meaning
there.
the
question
is
what
happens
when
he
sells
it
to
his
bookstore
and
you
or
i
go
in
and
buy
it
and
we
want
to
give
a
copy
to
our
wife
when
we
get
back
to
the
united
states.
the
question
is,
did
--
is
that
unlawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no
exception
i
take
it
once
i
bring
back
five
copies
and
i
give
one
to
my
son.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
fair
use.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
reason
--
what
i
was
trying
to
bring
up
and
i
didn't
do
it
artfully--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is,
imagine
toyota,
all
right?
millions
sold
in
the
united
states.
they
have
copyrighted
sound
systems.
they
have
copyrighted
gps
systems.
when
people
buy
them
in
america,
they
think
they're
going
to
be
able
to
resell
them.
now,
under
your
reading
--
now,
this
is
one
of
their
horribles,
i
gather,
and
i
want
to
know
your
answer
to
it.
under
their
reading,
the
millions
of
americans
who
buy
toyotas
could
not
resell
them
without
getting
the
permission
of
the
copyright
holder
of
every
item
in
that
car
which
is
copyrighted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
or
am
i
wrong?
am
i
off
base
or
am
i
wrong
--
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
do
you
distinguish?
how
do
you
distinguish?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
explain
to
me,
because
they're
horribles
if
i
summarize
them,
millions
and
millions
of
dollars'
worth
of
items
with
copyrighted
indications
of
some
kind
in
them
that
we
import
every
year;
libraries
with
three
hundred
million
books
bought
from
foreign
publishers
that
they
might
sell,
resale,
or
use;
museums
that
buy
picassos
that
now,
under
our
last
case,
receive
american
protection
as
soon
as
that
picasso
comes
to
the
united
states,
and
they
can't
display
it
without
getting
permission
from
the
five
heirs
who
are
disputing
ownership
of
the
picasso
copyrights.
those
are
some
of
the
horribles
that
they
sketch.
and
if
i
am
looking
for
the
bear
in
the
mouse
hole,
i
look
at
those
horribles,
and
there
i
see
that
bear.
so
i'm
asking
you
to
spend
some
time
telling
me
why
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
we
need--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--interpretation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what
about
litigation
in
this
respect?
i
want
to
bring
you
back
to
the
horribles.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
main
point
is
that
horribles
haven't
occurred.
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sometimes
horribles
don't
occur
because
no
one
can
believe
it.
now,
for
example,
i
believe
there
is
going
to
be
a
storm,
but
it
hasn't
started
yet.
so
i
would
like
to
know
--
i
would
like
to
know,
if
you
were
the
lawyer
for
the
toyota
distributor,
and
if
you
were
the
lawyer
for
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art,
or
you
are
the
lawyer
for
a
university
library,
and
your
client
comes
to
you
and
says,
my
god,
i
just
read
the
supreme
court
opinion.
it
says
that
we
can't
start
selling
these
old
books
or
--
or
lending
them
or
putting
them
in
our
word
processor
or
reselling
the
toyota
without
the
--
without
looking
--
displaying
the
picasso
without
the
permission
of
the
copyright
holder,
who
may
or
may
not
be
toyota
itself.
what,
as
their
lawyer,
do
you
tell
them?
do
you
tell
them,
hey,
no
problem;
or,
do
you
tell
them,
you
might
become
a
law
violator;
or,
do
you
tell
them,
i
better
litigate
this?
what
do
you
tell
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
word
has
grounding.
it
is
coke
upon
littleton,
1628,
where
it
says
that
if
a
man
be
possessed
of
a
chattel
and
give
or
sell
his
whole
interest
upon
a
condition,
that
condition
is
no
good.
and
coke
says,
and
that's
how
it
should
be.
and
now
that's
picked
up
in
bobbs-merrill;
it's
picked
up
in
dr.
miles.
it's
been
the
law.
now
if,
in
fact,
there
are
two
ways
of
interpreting
the
statute,
and
one
is
consistent
with
that
basic
principle
of
commercial
law,
and
the
other
produces
some
of
the
complexities
that
you
have
just
mentioned,
isn't
it
better
to
go
with
the
common
law
and
simply
reaffirm
a
principle
that's
been
in
the
commercial
law
almost
forever?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
first
case
is
kirtsaeng
versus
john
wiley,
and
the
respondent
is
john
wiley
and
sons
as
a
publisher
of
textbooks.
it
holds
a
copyright
on
certain
textbooks
that
it
publishes
in
the
united
states,
but
it's
granted
an
asian
subsidiary
the
right
to
publish
the
same
textbooks
abroad.
the
petitioner,
supap
kirtsaeng
is
a
thai
national
who
is
studying
on
a
scholarship
in
the
united
states.
he
discovered
that
the
asian
edition
of
his
textbooks
that
wiley
had
licensed
was
cheaper
and
he
had
his
friends
in
relations
buy
copies
of
that
edition
in
thailand,
send
them
to
him
in
the
united
states,
and
he
resold
them
at
a
profit.
because
of
a
copyright
law
provision
called
“the
first-sale
doctrine,”
if
kirtsaeng
or
anyone
else
had
bought
copies
made
in
the
united
states
after
he
bought
them,
he
would
be
free
to
resell
them.
the
first-sale
doctrine
provides
that
if
you
buy
a
first
--
the
first
--
if
you
a
first-sale,
once
the
book
is
sold,
that
exhausts
the
copyright
and
the
buyer
is
pretty
much
free,
you
or
anybody
else,
to
do
what
he
wants
with
the
copy
that
he's
bought.
but
does
that
doctrine,
which
is
in
section
109
of
a
copyright
act,
does
that
doctrine
apply
when
the
copy
was
made
not
in
the
united
states,
but
it
was
made
abroad?
that
legal
question
is
difficult.
we
held
in
a
case
called
quality
king
that
the
first-sale
doctrine
is
a
defense
in
a
copyright
infringement
suit
that
involved
the
importation
of
a
book
from
abroad.
and
we
further
said
it
wasn't
relevant
whether
the
first-sale
took
place
domestically
or
abroad,
but
quality
king
was
a
case
where
the
copyrighted
items
were
made
in
the
united
states
and
they
were
sent
abroad
and
somebody
was
trying
to
bring
them
back.
but
here,
the
copies
were
made
abroad
and
that
fact
is
important
because
section
109
of
the
copyright
doctrine
says
that
first
law
--
says
that
the
first-sale
doctrine
applies
to
copies
“lawfully
made
under
this
title.”
so,
what
do
those
five
words,
“lawfully
made
under
in
this
title,”
what
do
those
five
words
mean?
should
we
interpret
them
geographically?
holding
that
they
apply?
and
does
the
first-sale
doctrine
applies
only
to
copies
that
have
been
made
in
the
united
states?
that
is
what
wiley
and
the
solicitor
general
roughly
argue.
or
should
we
interpret
the
words
non-geographically?
as
applying
to
copies,
whether
made
here
or
abroad,
but
have
been
made
in
accordance
with
the
copyrights
act
requirements.
that
is
what
kirtsaeng
argues.
ultimately,
we
conclude
that
kirtsaeng's
is
the
better
interpretation.
it
is
more
consistent
with
the
legislative
intent
that
the
act
reflects.
four
sets
of
considerations
lead
us
to
this
conclusion.
first,
we
think
the
language
leans
at
least
slightly
in
kirtsaeng's
favor.
as
interpreted
non-geographically,
those
five
words,
“lawfully
made
under
this
title,”
basically
distinguished,
lawfully
made
copies
from
pirated
copies.
protecting
purchasers
only
when
they
--
when
what
they
buy
has
been
lawfully
made,
according
to
the
u.s.
copyright
act.
the
geographical
interpretation,
however,
bristles
with
linguistic
difficulties.
since
the
phrase
says
nothing
about
geography,
wiley,
for
example,
must
claim
that
it
refers
to
where
the
act
applies
and
then
add
the
act
does
not
apply
to
copies
made
abroad.
it
doesn't,
why
not?
at
least
linguistically
speaking,
a
statute
that
imposes
a
tariff
on
rhododendrons
grown
in
nepal
applies
in
some
sense
to
those
foreign
rhododendrons
from
the
day
they
first
bud.
second,
the
context,
including
the
history
of
the
1976
revisions
to
the
act,
indicates
that
congress
used
those
five
words
in
the
statute,
not
to
prevent
the
doctrine
from
applying
to
sales
abroad,
but
to
achieve
totally
unrelated
purposes.
third,
we
normally
approach
relevant
statutory
text
with
an
assumption
that
congress
intended
to
codify,
not
to
displace
a
well-established
common
law
doctrine.
and
the
first-sale
doctrine
is
a
historically
venerable
common
law
doctrine.
about
a
century
before
the
framers
wrote
our
constitution,
lord
coke
in
his
treatise
on
littleton
explained
that
the
english
common
law
had
long
embodied
that
doctrine.
it
reflected
the
commercial
need
not
unnecessarily
to
interfere
with
competition
and
trade,
as
well
as
the
practical
difficulties
that
would
have
accompanied
any
judicial
effort
to
trace
what
a
purchaser
of
movable
goods
was
doing
with
them.
in
1908,
this
court
involves
merrill,
a
well-known
copyright
case
held
that
the
copyright
law
embodied,
in
some
sense,
this
doctrine.
and
of
course,
congress
codified
the
doctrine
in
1909.
forth,
to
accept
the
contrary
geographical
interpretation
threatened
serious
copyright
related
harm.
library
associations
tell
us
that
they
buy
many
thousands
of
books
printed
abroad.
the
libraries
do
not
necessarily
obtain
permission
to
circulate
those
books
in
the
united
states
after
they
buy
them.
how
are
they
to
find
the
copyright
owners
and
obtain
that
permission?
should
they
stop
circulating
the
books?
used-book
dealers
tell
us
that
for
similar
reasons,
the
geographical
interpretation
threatens
their
trade.
retailers
of
billions
of
dollars'
worth
of
imported
merchandise
often
with
copyrighted
labels,
shapes,
design
or
instructions,
tell
us
again
for
similar
reasons
that
they
faced
similar
threats.
museums
tell
us
that
they
may
find
it
difficult
to
display
20th
century
paintings
on
loan
from
foreign
museums
without
also
obtaining
permission
from
the
copyright
holders,
perhaps
the
artist
or
his
heirs,
who
may
be
difficult
to
find.
can
a
student
resell
a
used
textbook
bought
abroad?
can
a
buyer
of
a
foreign
automobile,
which
typically
contains
many
pieces
of
copyright
and
software,
resell
the
car
as
used?
whom
should
they
contact
to
get
the
necessary
permissions?
there
maybe
answers
to
these
problems,
but
they're
just
seem
to
us
too
many
linguistic
and
other
hurdles
preventing
the
adoption
of
other
answers
to
rely
upon
alternative
interpretive
solutions
to
keep
these
problems
within
bounds.
nor
can
we
rely
simply
upon
the
hope
that
copyright
holders
would
not
enforce
their
rights.
to
rely
upon
widespread
non-compliance,
to
make
the
law
workable
risks
undermining
habits
of
obedience,
thereby
threatening
respect
for
the
copyright
law
itself.
for
these
reasons
and
other
set
forth
in
our
opinion,
we
conclude
that
petitioner
kirtsaeng
has
correctly
interpreted
the
statute
and
we
set
aside
the
lower
court's
decision
to
the
contrary.
justice
kagan
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion
in
which
she
is
joined
by
justice
alito.
the
interpretive
question
is,
as
i
said,
a
difficult
one.
and
the
arguments
for
a
contrary
interpretation
are
clearly
set
forth
in
the
dissenting
opinion
written
by
justice
ginsburg
in
which
she
is
joined
by
justice
kennedy
and
in
which
justice
scalia
joins
except
as
to
parts
3
and
5
(b)(1).
