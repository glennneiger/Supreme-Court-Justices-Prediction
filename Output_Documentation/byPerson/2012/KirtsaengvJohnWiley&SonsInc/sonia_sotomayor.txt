mr.
rosenkranz,
can
i
ask
you,
just
--
it
is
a
practical
question,
but
i
think
it
has
theoretical
impact.
a
manufacturer
can
choose
to
contract
or
a
copyright
holder
choose
to
contract
with
someone
here
to
manufacture
their
goods.
they
could
contract
with
someone
abroad,
anywhere
in
the
world,
directly.
they
can
choose
to
license
their
trademark
and
permit
a
distributor
abroad
to
manufacture
under
their
u.s.
copyright;
or
they
can
permit
the
licensee
to
register
the
copyright
abroad
and
distribute.
in
your
definition
of
“
lawfully
made
under
this
title
”,
does
“
lawfully
made
under
this
title
”
apply
to
all
of
those
situations,
i.e.--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
think
clearly
to
the
manufacturer
who
manufactures
abroad--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--clearly
to
the
manufacturer
who
licensed
a
distributor
to
do
it
for
it.
but
does
it
also
apply
to
the
--
to
the
copyright
owner
who
basically
gives
the
copyright
to
a
foreign
distributor
and
lets
the
foreign
distributor
register
it
abroad?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
is
--
that
is
broader
than
i
thought.
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
you
don't
mean
if
this
title
applied.
because
if
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
manufacturer
who
is
manufacturing
under
the
english
copyright,
because
the
distributor
has
an
english
copyright,
is
not
manufacturing
under
the
u.s.
copyright,
they
are
manufacturing
under
the
english
copyright.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
is
your
reading
now
that
when
the
library
imports
in
a
book
or
a
film
or
whatever
it's
importing
in,
it
goes
to
the
customs
agent
and
it
says
to
the
customs
agent:
i
don't
have
the
express
authorization
of
the
copyright
owner,
but
i'm
a
library,
so
i
can
import
this
book
in?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
--
i'm
a
person
who's
bought
the
book
in
england
and
i'm
bringing
it
to
my
wife?
what
provision
gives
me
the
right
to
do
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
deal
with
the
wife.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
does
the
wife
get
her
book?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no.
is
there
--
what
provision
gives
the
wife
a
right
under
your
reading?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
to
keep
for
yourself.
as
far
as
i
understand--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--your
reading,
i
brought
it
abroad,
i
can't
import
it
in.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
don't
those
horribles--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--why
is
it
that
a
u.s.
copyright
owner
who
contracts
in
england
to
make
books
--
he
doesn't
have
an
english
copyright,
he
just
simply
chooses
that
place
to
manufacture
as
opposed
to
the
u.s.
--
why
is
he
making
that
copy
under
english
law
and
not
under
his
rights
of
u.s.
copyright?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
he's
selling
it
no
--
no
differently
than
quality
king
was
--
or
the
quality
king--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--mr.
olson,
we
know
from
the
carp
exchange
that
the
response
was,
this
is
something
that
we
have
to
study
with
care,
in
1976.
the
parade
of
horribles
is
now
causing
the
solicitor
general
and
at
least
one,
if
not
two,
courts
of
appeals
to
write
exceptions
into
the
language
to
take
care
of
what
they
perceive
as
horribles.
isn't
it
incumbent
upon
us
to
give
the
statute
what
is
plainly
a
more
rational
plain
meaning
than
to
try
to
give
it
a
meaning
and
then
fix
it
because
we
understand
that
the
meaning
doesn't
make
sense?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
point
to
something
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
get
what
you
wanted
anyway.
that's
really
the
bottom
line.
we
undo
quality
king,
except
that
the
price
is
that
people
have
to
ship
their
manufacturing
abroad.
