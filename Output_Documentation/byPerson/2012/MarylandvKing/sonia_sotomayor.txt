justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
i'm
having
a
hard
time
understanding
the
bail
argument.
because
in
my
time,
most
bail
decisions
were
made
at
the
time
of
arrest.
and
here
the
arrest
was
in
april
and
the
results
didn't
come
up
until
august.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
yet,
he
was
detained
anyway,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
--
and
there
might
be
a
case
where
someone's
gotten
out,
but
it
would
be
the
rare
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
use
it
routinely
for
the
bail
determination.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
it
doesn't
include
the
time
to
collect
the
sample,
send
it
to
you
or
the
time
to
do
the
match.
it's
just
to
do
the
genome
rapid,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so
now,
i
see
two
lines
of
cases,
okay?
the
fourth
amendment,
which
says
you
can't
do
a
search
without
a
warrant
and
probable
cause.
and
samson.
and
most
of
your
brief
argument
was
based
on
samson.
as
i
read
samson,
it
was
the
special
relationship
between
the
parolee
or
the
probationary
person,
that
line
of
cases,
and
the
assumption
being
that
they're
out
in
the
world,
i
think,
by
the
largesse
of
the
state.
so
a
state
has
a
right
to
search
their
home
just
as
it
would
their
cell
essentially.
why
is
that
true
for
an
arrestee?
what
about
--
what
creates
this
special
relationship
that
permits
you
to
intrude,
search
their
home,
search
their
car,
search
their
person,
to
solve
other
cases?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
you're
going
to
have
to
tell
me
why
searching
their
person
is
different
than
searching
their
home
or
car.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
there's
no
other
case
but
samson
in
that
line
that
permits
searches
on
this
balancing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
i
want
to
know
is
what's
the
legal
theory
now?
how
far
do
we
let
the
state
go
each
time
it
has
some
form
of
custody
over
you
in
schools,
in
workplaces,
wherever
else
the
state
has
control
over
your
person?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
doesn't
explain
why
you
can't
go
into
his
home.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
mean,
you
know,
if
the
whole
issue
is
how
dangerous
is
he,
you
should
be
able
to
go
into
his
home,
into
his
car,
to
any
place
he
has
visited,
to
just
sort
of
run
rampant
in
his
life
to
make
sure
that
he
is
not
a
bail
risk.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
you
are,
because
what
you
are
saying
really
is
law
enforcement
need
alone,
without
any
suspicion
whatsoever
of
another
crime,
permits
you
to
take
this
information
from
the
person
and
use
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
key
principle
is
the
fourth
amendment--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
we
go
back
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
so
i
am
really
worried
about
the
question
you
haven't
satisfied
me
with,
which
is
i
agree
completely
that
today
it's
used
primarily
and
almost
exclusively
for
purposes
of
solving
other
crimes.
but
let's
--
is
this
--
the
question
that
i
think
one
of
my
colleagues
asked,
is
that
only
because
technology
hasn't
moved
fast
enough?
you
said
we
have
to
look
at
the
constitutional
principles
5
years
from
now
when
they
will
use
it
to
pull
up
a
guy's
criminal
history.
not
unsolved
crimes,
but
criminal
history.
get
to
that
day.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
me
what
the
--
why
you
would
then
say
that
would
still
be
unconstitutional.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
let's
assume
we
go
under
a
normal
fourth
amendment,
you
need
probable
cause
to
search.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
was
interested
in
a
broader
thought
process,
actually.
do
you
mind
giving
it
to
me?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
which
is,
there
is
something
inherently
dangerous
about
dna
collection
that
is
not
the
same
as
fingerprinting.
