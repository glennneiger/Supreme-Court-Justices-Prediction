but,
ms.
winfree,
that
can't
be
quite
right,
can
it?
i
mean,
such
a
person,
assume
you've
been
arrested
for
something,
the
state
doesn't
have
the
right
to
go
search
your
house
for
evidence
of
unrelated
crimes;
isn't
--
isn't
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
it
doesn't
have
the
right
to
search
your
car
for
evidence
of
unrelated
crimes.
justice
elena
kagan
just
because
you've
been
arrested
doesn't
mean
that
you
lose
the
privacy
expectations
and
things
you
have
that
aren't
related
to
the
offense
that
you've
been
arrested
for.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
and
if
there
were
a
real
identification
purpose
for
this,
then
i
understand
that
argument.
but
if
it's
just
to
solve
cold
cases,
which
is
the
way
you
started,
then
it's
just
like
searching
your
house,
to
see
what's
in
your
house
that
could
help
to
solve
a
cold
case.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
if
that's
what
you're
basing
it
on,
then
you're
not
basing
it
on
an
arrestee.
i
mean,
then
the
chief
justice
is
right,
it
could
be
any
arrestee,
no
matter
how
minor
the
offense.
it
could
be
just
any
old
person
in
the
street.
why
don't
we
do
this
for
everybody
who
comes
in
for
a
driver's
license
because
it's
very
effective?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
dreeben,
is
it
really?
because
if
this
were
like
fingerprints,
i
think
that
you
would
have
a
quite
good
case.
but
as
i've
been
reading
about
this,
it
seems
as
though
the
technology
is
not
the
same
as
the
fingerprint
technology;
and
because
the
technology
is
different,
it
is
used
differently.
fingerprints
you
go
in,
you
put
in
a
fingerprint,
there
is
identifying
information
that
comes
back
to
you
in
5
minutes,
right?
this,
you
put
in
something,
and
ms.
winfree
said
was
11
to
17
days,
in
this
case
it's
four
months.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
used
because
the
technology
doesn't
allow
it
to
be
used
as
the
kind
of
routine
identifier
that
fingerprints
does.
so
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
dreeben,
could
i
understand
how
this
works
exactly?
the
swab
is
taken,
and
if
i
--
there
is
a
database
which
is
known
offenders
and
there
is
a
database
which
is
kind
of
crime
scene
dna;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
and
when
the
swab
is
taken
and
it's
put
into
the
system,
you
check
that
against
the
crime
scene
dna
database;
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
check
it
--
does
maryland
check
it
against
the
known
offenders
database?
justice
elena
kagan
because
that
suggests
that
right
now
it's
functioning
as
let's
solve
some
crimes,
which
is
a
good
thing,
you
know,
that
we
should
solve
some
crimes,
but
not
as
an
identification
device.
because
here
if
it
were
an
identification
device
you
would
be
comparing
it
to
the
known
offender
database,
not
to
the
cold
case
database.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
typical
special
needs
case
is
one
in
which
we
say
there's
no
law
enforcement
interest,
that
there's
an
interest
other
than
the
interest
in
solving
crime.
justice
elena
kagan
when
you
started,
mr.
dreeben,
you
started
by
saying,
you
know,
they
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
and
we
have
important
interests.
you
went
right
into
free-form
balancing.
that's
typically
not
the
way
we
do
it.
if
we
said
to
you,
look,
you
know,
the
way
we
do
it
is,
you
need
a
warrant,
and
if
you
--
there
is
some
exceptions,
then
you
have
to
put
yourself
into
a
well-recognized
exception
where
you
can
search
without
a
warrant.
and
that's
especially
the
case
when
there
is
no
suspicion
whatsoever.
how
would
you
do
it?
how
would
you
do
it
short
of
free-form
balancing?
what
exception
are
you
a
part
of?
justice
elena
kagan
what
are
your
other
two
distinctions?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
shanmugam,
this
seems
to
me
a
real
distinction
in
this
case
as
it's
been
litigated.
i
take
what
the
government
is
saying
is
something
like:
give
us
5
years
and
those
won't
look
very
different.
in
other
words,
we
will
be
able
to
do
in
5
years
time
exactly
what
we
can
do
with
fingerprinting,
except
it
will
be,
as
justice
breyer
says,
more
accurate.
so
we
are
just
about
5
years
ahead
of
that,
so
give
us
a
break.
justice
elena
kagan
just
suppose
--
i
mean,
i
guess
the
question
is
would
this
be
unconstitutional?
it's
not
the
world
we
are
living
in
now,
but
let
me
--
10
years
from
now
the
government
says,
we
are
really
switching
over
to
a
fingerprint
system
--
to
a
dna
system
and
what
that
system
is
going
to
allow
us
to
do,
is
it's
going
to
allow
us
to
identify,
and
it's
going
to
allow
us
to
bring
up
the
old
criminal
history
and
it's
going
to
allow
us
to
see
whether
there
are
also
unsolved
crimes
that
we
can
tag
to
this
person
and
discover
that
he's
really,
really
dangerous.
all
right?
and
so
the
government
puts
that
system
into
effect.
is
it
constitutional?
