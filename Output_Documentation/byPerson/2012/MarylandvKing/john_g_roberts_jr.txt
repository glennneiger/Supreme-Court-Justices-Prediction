chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
12-207,
maryland
v.
king.
ms.
winfree?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
procedure
limits
the
collection
to
certain
violent
offenses,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
argument
would
not
be
so
limited,
would
it?
under
your
theory,
there's
no
reason
you
couldn't
undertake
this
procedure
with
respect
to
anybody
pulled
over
for
a
traffic
violation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
understand.
but
there's
no
reason
you
couldn't,
right?
i
gather
it's
not
that
hard.
police
officers
who
give
breathalyzer
tests,
they
can
also
take
a
q-tip
or
whatever
and
get
a
dna
sample,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
long
does
it
take
to
--
to
undergo
the
procedure?
you
say,
ah
and
then--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
dreeben?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
but
that
doesn't
mean,
for
example,
that
you
can
go
into
their
house
without
a
warrant.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
factual
question.
i
understand
your
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
it
only
looks
at
26
loci
and
they
are
supposedly
not
connected
in
any
way
with
other
information.
does
the
sample
that
you
retain
--
can
it
be
evaluated
more
broadly?
in
other
words,
saying,
well,
the
law
says
we
only
look
at
these
13,
but
we
have
this
saliva,
we
want
to
look
at
all
sorts
of
other
stuff.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
argument
only
makes
sense
if
we're
in
your
future
world
where
it's
90
minutes,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
depends
on,
if
we
have
a
situation
such
as
maryland
says
11
to
17
days,
the
footnote,
whatever,
the
amicus
brief
says
something
else,
but
you
are
not
going
to
put
off
the
bail
hearing
for
2
weeks.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
according
to
samson
and
knights,
you're
dealing
with
people
who
are
still
subject
to
the
--
a
criminal
sentence.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
shanmugam?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
is
right.
but
i'm
curious
as
to
why
your
position
is
that
--
let's
say
he
served
his
time.
he's
no
longer
subject
to
the
criminal
justice
system.
he's
not
on
parole,
he's
not
a
probationer.
you
concede
that
the
dna
evidence
can
be
taken
from
him,
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
is
the
pertinence
of
the
fact
--
i
mean,
this
is
not
something
that
people
are
or
can
keep
private.
i
mean,
if
you're
in
the
interview
room
or
something,
you
take
a
drink
of
water,
you
leave,
you're
done.
i
mean,
they
can
examine
the
dna
from
that
drink
of
water.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
doesn't
that
compromise
the
--
the
expectation
of
privacy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
it's
not
a--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--my
question
was
not
trying
to
get
at
whether
it's
a
search
or
not,
it's
whether
--
it's
getting
at
the
reasonableness
of
the
expectation
of
privacy
that
the
--
your
dna
is
protected
from
examination
when
it's
left
wherever
you
happened
to
have
been.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
isn't
that
part
of
the
--
isn't
that
part
of
the
question,
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
person's
dna?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
you're
simply
just
--
you're
--
i
guess
that's
begging
the
question.
and
--
but
i'd
just
be
repeating
my
question
--
how
legitimate
is
it
to
you
to
expect
privacy
in
something
that
the
police
can
access
without
you
even
knowing
about
it,
without
any
voluntary
or
involuntary
--
if
you
take
a
drink
of
water,
if
you
leave
behind
a
cigarette
butt?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
are
two
different,
two
different
interests.
one
is
we
want
to
solve
unsolved
crimes;
and
the
other
is
we
want
to
be
sure
--
we
have
someone
in
our
custody
and
we
want
to
be
sure,
before
he
is
released
back
into
the
community,
that
he
isn't
a
person
who
has
committed
five
violent
crimes
before
that.
now,
your
brief
says,
well,
the
only
interest
here
is
the
law
enforcement
interest.
and
i
found
that
persuasive
because
of
the
concern
that
it's
going
to
take
months
to
get
the
dna
back
anyway,
so
they
are
going
to
have
to
release
him
or
not
before
they
know
it.
but
if
we
are
in
a
position
where
it
now
takes
90
minutes
or
will
soon
take
90
minutes
to
get
the
information
back,
i
think
that's
entirely
different,
because
there
you
can
find
out
whether
--
it's
just
tied
in
with
the
bail
situation,
do
you
want
to
release
him
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
because,
that's
because
we
are
not
yet
at
a
situation
where
it
takes
90
minutes.
sure,
it's
not
going
to
do
you
any
good
if
it's
taking
4
months
or
whatever
it
took
in
this
case.
but
if
it's
at
the
point
where
it's
90
minutes,
it
would
be
critical
to
make
that
determination.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
let's
say
the
judge
or
the
magistrate
is
going
to
make
a
bail
determination
and
he
says:
well,
it's
important
to
me
to
know
whether
you
are
going
to
commit
another
crime.
so
we
are
not
saying
you
have
to
give
a
dna
sample,
but
it
will
enter
into
my
calculation
if
you
refuse
to
do
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
does
that
mean?
is
that
okay
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
do
it
--
doesn't
that
sound
just
like
a
breathalyzer?
you
are
pulled
over,
they
say,
we
want
you
to
take
a
breathalyzer
test.
they
say,
you
don't
have
to,
but
if
you
don't
your
license
is
suspended
for
6
months
or
whatever.
why
isn't
that
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
disclose
all
of
this
intimate
private
information
when
you
take
a
drink
of
water
and
leave
--
leave
the
glass
behind.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
winfree,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
can
i
base
a
decision
today
on
what
you
tell
me
is
going
to
happen
in
2
years?
you
say,
in
2
years
we
will
have
this
rapid
dna
available,
but
we
don't
now.
don't
i
have
to
base
a
decision
on
what
we
have
today?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-207,
maryland
versus
king.
