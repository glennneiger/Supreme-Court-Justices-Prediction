justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
particular
specific
quick
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
read
this,
this
concerns
people
arrested
for
a
felony,
a
crime
of
violence,
attempted
crime
of
violence,
burglary
or
attempted
burglary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
we're
not
talking
about
people
who
are
driving
cars
and
traffic
stops
and
all
these
other
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
thing
we
have
to
decide
is
whether
a
person,
where
there's
probable
cause
to
arrest
a
person
for
those
four
crimes,
their
fingerprints
are
all
taken.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
whether
they
also
can
take
dna,
that's
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
nothing
else.
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
part
surprised
us.
then
do
you
think
the
states
are
wrong?
i
mean,
they
all
say
in
their
brief,
in
footnote
10:
dna
identification
database
samples
have
been
processed
in
as
few
as
2
days
in
california,
and
although
around
30
days
has
been
average.
so
i
guess
the
technology
is
there
now
to
process
this
in
2
days,
not
9
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
case
of
--
do
you
have
any
information
--
are
there
instances
with
fingerprints
where
returns
have
not
come
back
for
as
long
as
30
days,
or
are
they
all,
or
almost
all,
done
in
5
minutes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
to
give
a
complete
answer
to
what
justice
alito
and
justice
kagan
both
were
asking,
i
think.
to
summarize
that,
if
i
look
in
terms
of
intrusion,
i
am
not
talking
legally;
i
am
talking
practically.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
--
i
can
argue
that
it
is
certainly
a
much
lesser
intrusion
than
fingerprints.
you
have
to
stand
there,
have
the
thing
rolled;
stick
out
your
tongue.
i
mean,
it's
hard
to
say
it's
more
for
me.
i'm
not
saying
for
others.
accuracy,
it's
much
more
accurate,
and
that
doesn't
just
help
the
defendant.
there
is
a
whole
brief
here
filed
by
the
victims
that
have
case
after
case
where
people
spent
5
years
in
prison
wrongly
and
where
this
system
and
the
codis
helped
victims
avoid
being
arrested
and
sent
to
jail
when
they
were
innocent.
so
it
works
both
ways.
so
one,
it's
no
more
intrusive.
two,
it
is
much
more
accurate.
and
three
and
four
and
five,
how
it's
different
and
worse
in
practice,
is
what
i
would
ask
you
to
summarize.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
by
the
way,
when
you
talk
about
what
information
you
could
get
out
of
it,
there
is
a
brief
filed
by
leading
scientists
in
the
field.
and
i
came
away
from
the
brief
thinking
there
isn't
much
more
information,
because
fingerprints
can
be
abused,
too.
of
course,
you
can
learn
loads
from
fingerprints.
photos,
try
photos;
my
god,
you
could
learn
a
lot:
who
he
was,
who
--
you
know,
so
all
these
things
could
be
abused.
but
i
came
away
from
that
brief,
frankly,
to
think,
well,
in
terms
of
the
possibility
of
abuse,
it's
there,
but
these
other
things,
photos,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
tell
me
in
light
of
that
hostile
question--
[laughter]
--i
would
like
you
--
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me,
okay,
it's
different
from
fingerprints
and
worse
because
of
one,
two,
three,
and
i
will
write
it
down
and
i'll
remember
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think
i
can
totally
lose
this
because
i
have
a
confusion
that
you
can
clear
up.
there
is
something
to
what
you
say.
i
see
what
you
are
saying.
but
what
does
this
word
“
identification
”
mean?
it's
used
for
identification.
we
have
a
person
who's
been
arrested.
he
writes
his
name
down,
mr.
smith.
maybe
he's
lying.
we
have
his
picture.
well,
his
picture's
pretty
good.
if
he
turns
up
in
a
bar
somewhere
in
the
future,
we
can
look,
see,
and
that's
awfully
good.
and
now
you
say,
well,
what
is
fingerprinting
doing
that
photos
aren't
doing
in
terms
of
identification?
what
does
it
do
in
terms
of
just
identification?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
that
mean,
confirming
his
identity?
we
have,
you
mean
what,
what
exactly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
really?
i
mean,
do
you
think
the
fingerprints
--
where
do
you
go
to
find
out
if
he's
alonzo
king?
a
lot
of
people
have
never
had
their
fingerprints
taken
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
to
determine
what
his
name
really
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
you
want
to
determine
what
his
name
really
is
plus
his
adjudicated
criminal
history,
and
here
we
have
the
dna,
which
i
guess
might
or
might
not
help
determine
what
his
name
really
is;
and
his
criminal
history,
it
does
about
the
same.
and
also
fingerprints
are
sometimes
used
to
--
for
unsolved
crimes,
and
they
are
sometimes
used
for
unsolved
crimes
but
your
point
really
is
more
for
unsolved
crimes.
have
i
got
it?
