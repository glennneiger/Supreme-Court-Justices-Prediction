mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
arrestees
are
in
a
unique
category,
they
are
on
the
gateway
into
the
criminal
justice
system.
they
are
no
longer
like
free
citizens
who
are
wandering
around
on
the
streets
retaining
full
impact
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
arrest
itself
substantially
reduces
the
individual's
expectation
of
privacy.
the
arrestee
can
be
searched
and
sent
to
arrest.
his
property,
whether
or
not
connected
with
a
crime,
can
be
inventoried.
when
he's
taken
into
the
jail
situation,
he
can
be
subjected
to
a
visual
strip
search.
if
he's
admitted
to
the
population
of
the
jail,
he'll
be
given
a
tb
test
and
a
thorough
medical
screen.
these
are
not
individuals
who
are
like
free
citizens,
and
they
are
not
like
free
citizens
in
another
significant
respect.
arrestees
are
rarely
arrested
for
the
first
time.
they
tend
to
be
repeat
customers
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
up
to
70
percent
of
arrestees
have
been
previously
arrested.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
certainly
correct,
chief
justice
roberts,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
going
into
the
house
will
expose
a
substantial
number
of
highly
private
things
to
the
view
of
the
state.
taking
a
dna
sample
is
not
of
that
character.
it
is
far
more
like
taking
a
fingerprint.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
by
law,
the
government,
under
codis,
and
the
states
cannot
look
at
anything
except
identification
information.
the
sample
contains
the
entire
genome.
the
sample
cannot
be
looked
at
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
i
think
it's
critical
to
this
case
to
--
for
the
court
to
understand
that
if
the
court
concludes,
as
is
probably
correct,
that
the
individual
will
retain
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
genomic
material
that
does
not
reveal
identity,
then
additional
fourth
amendment
scrutiny
would
be
required
before
the
government
could
make
use
of
the
rest
of
the
genome.
here,
it's
making
use
of
an
identity
indicator
that
is
highly
similar
to
fingerprints
with
one
significant
difference:
it
is
far
more
accurate.
when
respondent
committed
his
rape--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
are
not
wrong,
justice
kagan,
but
the
future
is
very
close
to
where
there
will
be
rapid
dna
analyzers
that
are
devices
that
can
analyze
and
produce
the
identification
material
in
the
dna
within
90
minutes.
and
the
design
of
this
program
is
to
put
them
at
the
booking
station
so
that
dna
can
be
taken
and
within
90
minutes
that
information
is
known.
in
that
circumstance,
it
will
be
highly
relevant
to
the
immediate
release/custody
decision,
which
it
already
can
play
a
role
in--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
justice
breyer.
yes,
justice
breyer,
there
is
no
question
it
can
be
done
quickly
because
of
the
volumes.
i'm
not
contending
that
today--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--fingerprint
histories
tend
to
come
back
quickly
except
if
the
prints
are
unrecognizable
or
unreadable.
it
is
very
significant,
i
think,
that
fingerprints
are
used
for
crime
solution
as
well
as--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
i
cannot
tell
you,
justice
alito.
it
is
now
in
use.
it
is
in
use
both
for
identification
and,
contrary
to
the
representation
of
respondent
in
his
brief,
fingerprints
are
run
against
the
latent
fingerprint
database
which
reflects
fingerprints
from
crime
scenes.
it
returns
about
50,000
hits
a
year.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
at
any
point
because
the
state
has
a
compelling
interest
in
taking
biometric
identification
information
from
the
individual
that
is
arrested
and
using
it
for
a
myriad
of
purposes:
determining
criminal
history,
attempting
to
solve
crimes,
funneling
that
information
back--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
the
routine
method
under
codis,
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
do
not
know
precisely
whether
maryland
does
that.
the
federal
system
does
not
routinely
do
that.
upgrades
to
the
software
system
will
permit
it
to
do
that,
and
many
states
do
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
agree
with
that
and
i
think
that
in
california
the
brief
for
the
states
indicates
that
many
states
do
that
and
california
itself
uses
it
to
resolve
discrepancies
in
identity
when
a
fingerprint
comes
back
and
it
returns
to
multiple
names,
or
the
fingerprint
is
not
good
enough
to
permit
an
identification.
california
cross-checks,
so
it
does
perform
an
identification
function.
and
as
i
suggested,
with
the
advent
of
rapid
dna,
it's
not
that
it
is
unconstitutional
before
rapid
dna,
but
rapid
dna
will
permit
dna
identification
to
replace
fingerprint
identification
because
it's
far
more
accurate
and
it
has
far
more
utility
in
the
secondary
purpose
of
fingerprints,
which
is
to
match
them
to
latent
prints
and
solve
crimes.
and
this
is
highly
relevant
to
both
of
the
major
purposes
for
taking
dna,
crime
solution
and
facilitating
the
release/custody
determination.
any
judge
who
is
looking
at
a
bail
case
would
like
to
know
--
i
have
a
guy
who
has
been
arrested
on
grand
theft
auto.
he
has
no
criminal
history.
should
i
release
him
back
on
the
street?
well,
it's
a
first
offense,
he
has
family
ties;
maybe
yes.
if
that
judge--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
serves
an
enhanced
reliability
function
to
ensure
there
is
no
mix-up
and
it
provides
an
evidentiary
function
of
permitting
the
new
dna
match
to
be
admitted
in
a
sample
that
is
taken
under
the
warrant.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
undercutting
the
value
of
taking
dna
on
the
spot
because,
i
was
indicating,
the
judge
who
would
know
this
defendant's
dna
came
back
and
returned
a
cold
case
hit
to
a
murder-rape,
he's
not
such
a
good
risk
to
be
put
back
on
the
street.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
but
bail
can
be
revoked
and
the
government
will
go
back
in
and
make
a
motion
to
revoke
bail
if
new
information
emerges
that
indicates
this
individual
is
a
danger
to
the
community.
and
the
whole
point
of
this
is
we
are
talking
about
arrestees,
somebody
who
has
taken
a
step
into
the
gateway
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
the
criminal
justice
system
at
that
point
has
to
deal
with
this
person.
it
has
to
know
who
is
this
person,
which
includes
what
has
this
person
done
so
we
know
whether
to
release
him
and,
if
we
keep
him,
in
what
situations
do
we
keep
him.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
it
does,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
are
not
asking
for
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court's
balancing
test
suggests
that
these
two
cases
are
equivalent.
my
first
submission
is
that
because
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
saying
that
because
an
arrestee
is
someone
whose
conduct
has
given
rise
to
probable
cause
that
he
committed
a
crime,
he's
in
a
different
position
from
ordinary
citizens.
and
this
court
does,
as
it
did
in
samson
and
in
knights,
balance
the
expectations
of
privacy
against
the
governmental
interests.
and
here,
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
minimal
in
the
cheek
swab,
and
the
information
obtained.
it's
identical--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
they're
differently
situated
in
that
respect,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
will
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
case
on
my
side
that
decides
the
case
this
way.
and
there's
no
case
that
--
on
respondent's
side
that
decides
the
case
for
him.
the
court
i
think
has
treated
the
category
of
what
he
calls
special
needs
cases
--
what
the
court
has
called
special
needs
cases
--
as
dealing
with
suspicionless
or
warrantless
intrusions
on
ordinary
citizens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
we
have
a
strong
law
enforcement
interest
with
respect
to
people
who
are
arrested
based
on
probable
cause.
they
are
no
longer
similarly
situated
to
other
people.
they
can
be
deprived
of
their
liberty.
their
property
can
be
searched
upon
entry
into
the
jail.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we're
not
asking
for
a
new
exception.
what
we're
asking
for
is
for
the
court
to
apply
what
it
called
"the
key
principle
of
the
fourth
amendment.
"
it
said
that
in
bell
v.
wolfish.
it
said
that
in
martinez--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
kennedy,
it's
not.
that
stands
on
its
own
doctrinal
footing.
but
we
do
think
the
fact
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
is
certainly
a
search--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--you
can
certainly
look
at
it
as
an
incident
of
the
arrest.
the
court's
search
incident
to
arrest
cases
have
been
bottomed
on
different
justifications
than
the
ones
that
we're
advancing
here.
i'm
entirely
happy
if
you,
justice
kennedy,
view
it
as
an
incident
to
arrest
in
that
sense,
because
i
think
that
it
is
appropriately
viewed
as
something
that
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
in
doing
once
a
person
has
been
arrested,
and
that
is,
knowing
who
that
person
is,
which
includes
knowing
what
the
person
has
done.
and
dna
does
that
in
a
far
more
powerful
way
than
fingerprints
have
done--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
inaccurate,
justice
scalia.
a
search
incident
to
arrest
allows
a
full
search
of
the
person
for
any
destructible
evidence,
because
a
person
who
has
been
arrested
has
a
tremendous
incentive
to
destroy
evidence.
and
i
just
want
to
come
back--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
on
--
on
the
individual's
person.
the
crime
of
arrest
limitation
appears
only
in
arizona
v.
gant,
and
it
relates
to
cars.
but
i
think
it's
critical
to
note
that
respondent
has
conceded
that
an
individual
can
have
their
dna
taken
once
convicted.
suppose
we
have
the
same
individual
who's
picked
up
on
grand
theft
auto,
and
that
individual
knows
that
if
he's
convicted
of
grand
theft
auto,
he
is
going
to
have
his
dna
taken.
but
he
also
knows
that
he's
committed
a
string
of
rapes.
and
if
the
government
cannot
take
his
dna
now,
it
will
not
connect
him
--
may
i
complete
the
sentence
--
it
will
not
connect
him
to
those
rapes.
so
he
has
a
tremendous
incentive
to
flee.
the
government
has
a
tremendous
need
for
this
information
at
the
time
of
arrest
to
solve
crimes,
exonerate
the
innocent,
and
give
closure
to
victims.
thank
you.
