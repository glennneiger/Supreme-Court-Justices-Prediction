justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
really
good.
i'll
bet
you
if
you
conducted
a
lot
of
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
you'd
get
more
convictions,
too.
[laughter]
that
proves
absolutely
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
its
purpose,
to
enable
you
to
identify
future
criminals,
the
perpetrators
of
future
crimes?
that's
the
purpose
of
it?
i
thought
that
that
wasn't
the
purpose
set
forth
in
the
--
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
do.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
our
--
our
search
incident
to
arrest
cases
don't
allow
that.
that's
sort
of
the
point.
they
--
they
allow
you
to
search
for
firearms,
they
allow
you
to
search
for
material
that
relates
to
the
crime
for
which
the
person
has
been
arrested.
but
you
can't
search
the
person
for
other
stuff.
justice
antonin
scalia
evidence
relating
to
matters
other
than
the
crime
of
arrest?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shanmugam,
i
--
i
wouldn't
have
made
the
concession
that
you've
made,
that
this
case
is
about
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if
there's
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
there's
no
search.
but
here,
there
is
a
search.
you
have
a
physical
intrusion.
you
--
you
pull
a
guy's
cheek
apart
and
stick
a
--
a
swab
into
his
mouth.
that's
a
search.
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
thought
you
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
gave
us
one
and
two.
i
have
been
waiting
for
three.
will
you
drop
the
shoe?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
if
we
believe
that
the
purpose
of
it
has
much
to
do
with
whether
it's
legitimate
or
not,
you
can't
demonstrate
that
the
purpose
is
immediate
identification
of
the
people
coming
into
custody.
you
just
can't
demonstrate
that
now.
maybe
you
can
in
2
years.
the
purpose
now
is
--
is
the
purpose
you
began
your
presentation
with,
to
catch
the
bad
guys,
which
is
a
good
thing.
but
you
know,
the
fourth
amendment
sometimes
stands
in
the
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
describe
that
dissenting
opinion.
the
court's
opinion
barely
mentions
the
crucial
fact
about
this
case.
the
search
here
was
entirely
suspicionless.
the
police
had
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
that
king's
dna
would
link
him
to
any
crime.
in
approving
that
suspicion
a
search,
the
court
has
cast
aside
a
bedrock
rule
of
our
fourth
amendment
law
that
the
government
may
not
search
its
citizens
for
evidence
of
crime
unless
there
is
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
such
evidence
will
be
found.
the
men
who
wrote
and
ratified
that
amendment
had
come
to
know
well
what
it
was
like
to
live
under
a
regime
that
did
not
obey
this
principle.
whenever
we
have
allowed
suspicionless
searches,
we
have
insisted
upon
a
justifying
motive
apart
from
mere
investigation
of
crime.
our
cases
call
those
exceptional
searches
special
needs
searches,
an
example
being
the
drug
testing
of
train
engineers
for
public
safety
purposes.
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
no
special
need,
no
non-investigative
motive
justified
the
swabbing
of
king's
cheek.
the
purpose
was
to
learn
whether
king
had
committed
an
unsolved
crime.
a
fact
the
court
does
mention
often
is
that
king
was
under
arrest
when
his
dna
was
taken,
but
that
is
quite
irrelevant.
the
state's
accusations
do
not
suddenly
render
a
man
stranger
to
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
limited
circumstances
in
which
we
have
permitted
searches
of
arrestees
do
not
support
what
the
court
does
today.
the
fact
of
an
arrest
will
allow
a
brief
search
for
weapons,
but
that
is
a
type
of
a
special
need
search,
a
matter
of
officer's
safety,
not
crime
solving.
and
if
the
police
believe
that
an
arrestee
has
evidence
relevant
to
his
crime
of
arrest,
they
may
search
him
for
it,
but
that
is
not
a
suspicionless
search.
we
have
never
held,
however,
that
arrestees
maybe
subjected
to
general
suspicionless
searches
simply
because
that
would
be
useful
to
solve
unrelated
crimes.
that
is
a
terrifying
principle,
too
much
in
the
end
even
for
today's
majority.
so
after
genuflecting
to
king's
arrestee
status,
the
court
dedicates
nearly
all
of
its
opinion
to
a
different
argument.
king's
dna
was
taken,
we
are
told,
to
identify
him.
that
assertion
taxes
the
credulity
of
the
credulous
unless
what
the
court
means
is
that
taking
king's
dna
identified
him
in
the
sense
of
enabling
the
police
to
learn
what
crimes
he
had
committed
before.
but
that
sort
of
identification
is
just
another
way
of
describing
the
police's
ordinary
interest
in
solving
crimes
which
is
never
enough
to
permit
a
suspicionless
search.
we
would
never,
for
example,
permit
the
police
to
search
every
lawfully
stopped
car
in
hopes
of
turning
up
evidence
of
unrelated
crimes.
but
doing
so,
would
identify
the
driver
in
the
question-begging
sense
the
court
uses
the
word
today,
that
is
in
the
sense
that
it
would
tell
whether
he
was
committing
or
had
committed
some
other
crimes.
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
identification,
the
sense
in
which
we
all
use
it,
the
dna
search
here
did
not
and
could
not
have
identified
king
for
a
host
of
reasons.
first,
the
maryland
statute
forbids
it.
it
sets
forth
several
permissible
purposes
for
dna
testing,
chief
among
them
being
investigation
of
crime,
but
while
it
permits
dna
testing
to
identify
missing
persons
and
to
identity
human
remains,
it
nowhere
mentions
identification
of
arrestees.
moreover,
under
maryland
law,
the
dna
testing
cannot
even
begin
until
the
arrestees'
first
appearance
in
court
which
makes
a
hash
out
of
the
court's
theory
that
dna
could
be
used
to
set
bail
and
once
the
testing
does
begin
it
is
far
too
slow
to
be
used
for
identification.
it
took
months
to
process
king's
dna
sample.
by
the
time,
and
not
because
of
some
mistake,
it
typically
takes
months
in
maryland.
by
the
time
it
was
done,
his
first
trial
was
nearly
over
and
the
case
was
titled
state
versus
king,
not
state
versus
john
doe.
and
when
the
sample
was
finally
processed,
it
was
not
used
to
confirm
king's
identity.
instead
of
being
checked
against
the
dna
samples
of
known
convicts
and
arrestees
which
would
have
identified
him,
king's
sample
was
compared
against
dna
of
unknown
individuals,
taken
from
unsolved
crimes.
that
is
perfectly
sensible
if
one
wants
to
solve
those
crimes,
but
it
is
baffling
if
one
wants
to
identify
someone.
in
fact,
when
king's
dna
was
entered
into
the
collection
of
arrestee
dna
samples,
it
was
entered
along
with
information
identifying
him.
so,
that
if
the
dna
matched
that
from
an
unsolved
crime,
they
would
know
whom
to
pursue.
in
other
words,
the
entire
design
of
the
database
assumes
that
the
identity
of
arrestees
will
already
be
known.
the
court's
comparisons
to
fingerprinting
and
other
booking
procedures
can
see
that
only
if
the
reader
knows
no
more
than
today's
opinion
chooses
to
tell
him
about
how
these
dna
searches
really
work.
an
arrestee
can
be
fingerprinted
in
moments
and
results
come
back
virtually
instantly.
the
fingerprint
database,
unlike
the
dna
database
for
unsolved
crimes,
contains
detailed
identification
information.
and
while
maryland
waited
three
days
after
his
arrest
as
its
law
required
to
begin
testing
king's
dna,
i
doubt
very
much
that
they
waited
that
long
to
ask
his
name
or
to
take
his
fingerprints.
fingerprinting
in
short
really
is
used
to
identify
arrestees.
it
does
the
job
so
well,
in
fact,
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
separate
wholly
redundant
confirmation
of
the
same
information
using
dna.
what
dna
adds
is
the
ability
to
solve
crimes,
nothing
more.
that
is
certainly
a
noble
objective,
but
not
one
that
can
justify
a
suspicionless
search.
the
court's
opinion
minimizes
the
seriousness
of
the
search.
it
is
not
as
intrusive,
the
opinion
says
as
would
be
a
suspicionless
search
of
the
home.
that
is
a
curious
view
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
lists
the
entities
protected
against
unreasonable
searches
in
the
following
order;
persons,
houses,
papers,
and
effects.
a
search
of
the
person
is
the
most
offensive.
i
would
not
want
to
have
been
the
royal
officer
charged
with
swabbing
the
cheek
of
patrick
henry
and
while
minimizing
the
intrusiveness
of
the
search,
the
court's
opinion
exaggerates
its
benefits.
the
dna
testing,
the
court
tells
us,
“may
have
the
salutary
effect
of
freeing
a
person
wrongfully
imprisoned
for
the
same
effect
--
for
the
same
offense.”
that
is
quite
impossible
since
the
dna
database
with
which
king's
dna
was
compared
contains
dna
connected
from
unsolved
crimes.
persons
are
wrongfully
imprisoned
only
for
solved
crimes.
to
assess
the
benefits
of
this
search,
one
also
must
realize
that
there
is
no
problem
once
the
individual
has
been
convicted
of
then
taking
his
dna.
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
that
person
convicted
are
less.
that
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
conviction.
so,
what
that
means
is
that
the
only
thing
achieved
by
today's
opinion
is
that
people
who
are
wrongfully
arrested
or
at
least
arrested
for
a
crime
that
they
are
not
convicted
of
will
be
subject
to
dna
testing.
if
they're
convicted,
there's
no
problem
about
using
it.
it's
only
the
innocent
arrestees.
the
court
attempts
to
disguise
the
vast
scope
of
today's
holding
by
promising
to
limit
it
to
those
who
have
been
arrested
for
what
it
calls
serious
offenses.
that
line
lacks
any
principle
basis
and
will
not
last.
if
you
believe
that
a
dna
search
will
identify
someone
arrested
for
bank
robbery,
you
must
believe
that
it
will
identify
someone
arrested
for
running
a
red
light.
to
decide
otherwise
would
require
the
sort
of
senseless
distinctions
that
this
court
is
not
accustomed
to
make,
is
not
supposed
to
make
if
there
is
any
difference
between
prescribing
legal
rules
willy-nilly
and
deciding
what
an
existing
legal
principle
requires.
in
the
end,
logic
will
out.
make
no
mistake
about
it
because
of
today's
decision,
your
dna
can
be
taken
and
entered
into
a
national
database
if
you
are
ever
arrested
rightly
or
wrongly
and
for
whatever
reason.
this
will
solve
some
extra
crimes
to
be
sure
but
so
would
taking
your
dna
whenever
you
fly
on
an
airplane.
surely
the
tsa
must
know
the
identity
of
the
flying
public.
for
that
matter,
so
would
taking
your
children's
dna
when
they
start
public
school.
it
maybe
wise
as
the
court
obviously
believes
to
make
the
leviathan
all
seeing
so
that
he
may
protect
us
all
the
better,
but
the
proud
men
who
wrote
the
charter
of
our
liberties
would
not
have
been
so
eager
to
open
their
mouths
for
royal
inspection.
i
respectfully
dissent.
