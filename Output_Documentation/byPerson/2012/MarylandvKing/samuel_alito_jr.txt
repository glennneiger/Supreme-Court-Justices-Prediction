justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
you
get
on
to
--
before
you
go
to
that,
fingerprints
have
been
taken
i
believe
from
people
who
are
booked
for
offenses
for
many,
many,
many
years;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
did
the
fbi's
afis
system
for
comparing
fingerprints
by
computer
begin?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
question
that
i
had
was
this:
if
the
constitutionality
of
taking
fingerprints
is
dependent
on
the
speed
with
which
a
fingerprint
comparison
can
be
done
now
by
a
computerized
system,
would
that
mean
that
the
taking
of
fingerprints
was
unconstitutional
back
in,
let's
say,
the
'50s
when
that
wasn't
possible
and
fingerprints
could
only
be
compared
manually?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
the
intrusion
is
worse
when
you
just
take
a
swab
and
you
go
inside
somebody's
cheek,
as
opposed
to
rolling
fingerprints?
which
is
the
greater
intrusion?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
which
is--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--well,
the
thrust
of
a
lot
of
what
we
have
been
presented
with
in
the
briefs
and
what
we
have
heard
this
morning
--
and
by
the
way,
i
think
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
criminal
procedure
case
that
this
court
has
heard
in
decades.
the
attorney
for
the
state
began
by
listing
a
number
of
crimes
just
in
maryland
that
had
been
solved
using
this.
so
this
is
what
is
at
stake:
lots
of
murders,
lots
of
rapes
that
can
be
--
that
can
be
solved
using
this
new
technology
that
involves
a
very
minimal
intrusion
on
personal
privacy.
but
why
isn't
this
the
fingerprinting
of
the
21st
century?
what
is
the
difference?
if
it
was
permissible
and
it's
been
assumed
to
be
so
for
decades,
that
it
is
permissible
to
fingerprint
anybody
who's
booked,
why
is
it
not
permissible
to
take
a
dna
sample
from
anybody
who
is
arrested?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
as
to
the
first,
in
our
cases
involving
searches
for
--
where
a
urine
sample
is
taken
to
determine
drug
use.
the
urine
can
be
analyzed
for
all
sorts
of
things
besides
the
presence
of
drugs,
and
the
court
has
said
in
those
cases,
we
are
only
going
to
consider
that
--
we
are
considering
that
this
is
a
reasonable
search
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
whether
the
person
has
taken
drugs,
not
all
the
other
information--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--that
can
be
obtained
from
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
was
the
purpose
of
fingerprinting
before
it
was
possible
to
make
fingerprint
comparisons
by
computer?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i
would
assume
that
before
it
was
possible
to
do
computer
searches,
the
way
in
which
fingerprinting
established
identification,
what
it
did
in
that
respect
was
to
identify
the
person
arrested
on
this
occasion
so
that
if
the
person
was
arrested
again,
then
the
police
would
know
that
it
was
the
same
person.
there
was
no
way
of
--
no
practicable
way
of
taking
the
fingerprints
of
somebody
who
was
booked
and
determining
whether
that
person
--
you
didn't
have
anything
to
compare
it
to.
and
they
certainly
--
you
couldn't
do
it
manually.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
yes,
so
you
know
that
on
day
one
you
have
arrested
--
you've
arrested
mr.
x,
and
then
a
year
later
you
arrest
somebody
else
and
you
know
it's
mr.
x
again.
and
dna
can
do
exactly
the
same
thing
except
more
accurately.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
someone
has
a
bloody
shirt
and
throws
it
away
in
the
trash
--
in
a
public
trash
can
along
the
street,
you
are
saying
that
the
police
can't
analyze
that
without
a
search
warrant?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
your
client
was
convicted
of
the
offense
of
arrest.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
it
was
a
serious
offense
punishable
by
up
to
10
years
imprisonment--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--isn't
that
correct?
and
he
was
sentenced
to
4
years.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
--
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
do
you
think
that
it
is
--
that
it
is
permissible
to
take
a
dna
sample
from
someone
who
is
convicted
of
an
offense
that
would
qualify
as
a
felony
under
common
law?
