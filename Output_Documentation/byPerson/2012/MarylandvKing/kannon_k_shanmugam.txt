mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
maryland
searched
my
client
without
a
warrant
in
order
to
investigate
crimes
for
which
there
was
no
suspicion.
it
is
settled
law
that
warrantless,
suspicionless
searches
are
presumptively
unconstitutional.
the
state
cites
no--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
correct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
that
is
also
correct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
don't
know
that
the
record
indicates
that.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
yes.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we're--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--yes.
just
to
be
clear,
justice
kennedy,
we're
not
disputing
the
proposition
that
certain
intrusions
on
privacy
are
permissible
as
to
arrestees,
but
where
we
fundamentally
disagree
with
the
state
and
the
federal
government
is
with
regard
to
the
argument
that
this
court
should
take
the
rationale
of
samson
v.
california,
and
essentially
extend
that
rationale
to
the
point
of
arrest.
the
government--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
correct.
an
agreed
part
of
the
condition
of
parole.
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
would
concede,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
--
that
it
could
be
taken
at
least
while
he
is
still
under
the
supervision
of
the
state,
because
after
all,
both
samson
and
knights
were
cases
in
which
the
individual
was
still
under
state
supervision.
that
is
to
say,
we're
not
arguing
that
at
the
point
of
conviction,
that
the
resulting
lessened
expectation
of
privacy
extends
in
perpetuity
as,
say,
a
firearm
or
felon
disability
does.
but
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
--
to
look
at
this
court's
cases
in
samson
and
knights,
they
both
centrally
depended
on
the
proposition
that
it
is
the
fact
of
conviction
that
deprives
an
individual
of
the
full
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
think
it's
an
open
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
search
when
dna
is
collected
from
cells
that
could
be
said
to
have
been
involuntarily
or
voluntarily
abandoned.
and
to
the
extent
that
there's
an
argument
that
there
would
still
be
a
search,
it
would
be
based
on
this
court's
reasoning
in
skinner,
where
the
court
suggested
that
the
subsequent
analysis
of
a
urine
sample
would
constitute
a
further
invasion
of
the
test
of--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
privacy
interest.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
would
say
two
things
about
the
privacy
interests
at
stake
here.
first
of
all,
there
is
an
intrusion
into
the
body,
and
that
is
what
triggers
the
applicability
of
the
fourth
amendment
here
to
be
sure.
but
it
is
also
a
relevant
intrusion
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
but
secondly,
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
there
is
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
contents
of
an
individual's
dna.
and
to
the
extent
that
this
court
were
to
engage
in
balancing,
we
certainly
think
that
interest
is
the--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--yes,
and
we
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
that
an
individual
has--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--mr.
chief
justice,
i've
heard
mr.
dreeben
concede,
as
i
think
he
must,
that
an
individual
retains
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
at
least
some
of
the
information
contained
in
the
individual's
dna.
and
i
suppose
we
can
have
a
dispute
about
what
types
of
information
would
qualify.
but
i
think
it
really
is
settled
that
there
are
profound
privacy
concerns
raised
by
the
government's
coming
into
possession
of
an
individual's
dna.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
scalia,
i
didn't
think
i
was
conceding
anything.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
if
i
was,
let
me
just
be
clear.
we
don't
think
that
this
court
should
be
engaging
in
balancing
here.
indeed,
that
is
really
our
principal
submission
to
the
court.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
we
think
that
it
is
settled
that
intrusions
into
the
body
constitutes
a
search
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
suppose
that
the
argument
could
be
made,
justice
alito,
that
there
is
a
similar
trespass
on
the
person
and,
therefore,
a
search
when
fingerprints
are
collected.
i
would
note
parenthetically
that
in
the
first
half
an
hour
of
this
argument
we
heard
no
explanation
either
by
the
state
or
by
the
federal
government
as
to
their
theory
as
to
why
fingerprinting
is
constitutional.
now,
we--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
alito,
we
think
that
fingerprinting
is
distinguishable
on
three
grounds.
first
of
all,
as
a
practical
matter,
an
individual's
dna
contains
far
more
information
and
far
more
personal
information
than
an
individual's
fingerprints.
but
as
a
doctrinal
matter,
we
think
that
fingerprinting
is
distinguishable--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--but
that
is
because--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--but
that
is
because,
justice
alito,
in
those
cases,
cases
like
skinner
and
von
raab
and
vernonia,
there
was
a
special
need
apart
from
the
ordinary
interests
in
law
enforcement.
and
here
it
is
clear
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
maryland
statute
and,
indeed,
the
similar
statutes
on
the
federal
and
state
levels
was
the
ordinary
interest
in
crime
control,
to
solve
unsolved
crimes.
and
that
is
why
those
special
needs
cases
are
distinguishable,
and
i
think
that's
why
the
state
essentially
disavows
any
reliance
on
the
special
needs
doctrine.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
with
regard
to
fingerprinting,
we
think
that,
notwithstanding
the
physical
intrusion
involved
with
taking
an
individual's
fingers
and
putting
them
on
the
pad,
that
the
better
view
is
that
fingerprinting
is
not
a
search,
and
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
addressed
the
question
it
has
suggested
that
fingerprinting
is
not
a
search
because
an
individual
has
no
expectation
of
privacy
in
their
fingerprints
because
their
fingers
are
constantly
exposed--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--sure.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
justice
breyer,
let
me--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--let
me
--
i
will
gladly
get
to
three
with
regard
to
fingerprinting,
and
then
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
balancing
in
the
event
that
the
court
reaches
it.
obviously
we
don't
think
that
balancing
is
appropriate
here
because
we
don't
think
that
the
special
needs
doctrine
is
applicable
and
we
don't
think
that
samson
should
be
extended
to
arrestees.
but
with
regard
to
fingerprinting,
the
other
reason
why
we
think
fingerprinting
is
different,
above
and
beyond
the
fact
that
we
think
the
better
view
is
that
fingerprinting
is
not
a
search,
is
because
fingerprinting
as
it
is
currently
practiced
does
serve
a
special
need.
the
primary
purpose
of
fingerprinting
is
to
identify
an
individual
who
is
being
taken
into
the
criminal
justice
system.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
and
my
response
to
that
would
be
that
under
the
special
needs
doctrine,
what
is
relevant
is
not
how
a
system
could
conceivably
operate;
what
is
relevant
is
the
primary
purpose
behind
the
program
at
issue.
so
if
the
government
were
to
come
back
in
5
years'
time
with
a
dna
testing
program
the
primary
purpose
of
which
was
pretrial
supervision
or
identification,
one
of
these
other
purposes
that
is
being
offered,
then
sure,
the
analysis
would
be
different.
that
is
simply
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
this
special
needs
doctrine,
unlike
the
rest
of
the
fourth
amendment,
looks
to
purpose,
namely
the
purpose
of
the
program
at
issue.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
justice
system
always
has
an
interest
in
law
enforcement
and
solving
crimes,
and
we
certainly
don't
dispute
that
proposition.
but
what
we
do
dispute
is
mr.
dreeben's
principal
submission
to
this
court,
which
is
that
simply
because
law
enforcement
can
do
certain
things
to
arrestees,
it
can
do
others.
the
primary--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
difference
between
an
arrestee
and
an
ordinary
citizen,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
as
to
an
arrestee
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
arrestee
committed
a
particular
offense.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
related--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--they
have
that
interest,
but
if
they
want
to
investigate
other
crimes,
they
have
to
do
what
they
would
have
to
do
as
to
an
ordinary
citizen.
they
have
to
have
a
warrant
or
some
level
of
individualized
suspicion.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
the
touchstone
of
the
analysis
under
the
special
needs
doctrine
is
what
was
the
primary
purpose
of
the
program
at
issue.
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
pretrial
supervision
was
a
purpose
of
any
of
these.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
said
to
justice
kagan,
the
constitutional
analysis
may
very
well
change
at
later
point.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
underscore
that
neither
the
state
of
maryland
nor
the
federal
government
identifies
a
single
instance
in
which
a
pretrial
supervision
decision
in
their
jurisdictions
was
altered
as
a
result
of
the
dna
test.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
outside
the
programmatic
context,
ordinary
fourth
amendment
rules
would
apply.
and
ordinary--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
i
think
in
that
circumstance,
where
there
is
no
individualized
suspicion,
a
search
cannot
occur,
and
an
arrestee
stands--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
you
know,
i
will
say
that
the
one
thing
that
is
slightly
different
about
your
hypothetical,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
analysis
might
be
somewhat
different
where
what
you
are
talking
about
is
a
condition
of
release.
i
think
you
would
trigger
the
unconstitutional
conditions
doctrine
and
the
analysis
might
operate
somewhat
separately,
somewhat
differently.
but
just
to
conclude
with
regard
to
my
answer
with
justice
kennedy
and
then
to
get
back
to
the
rest
of
justice
breyer's
question.
justice
kennedy,
with
regard
to
arrestees,
the
intrusions
on
privacy
that
are
permissible
are
all
intrusions
that
relate
to
the
arrest.
so
to
take
the
two
principal
examples,
the
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine,
which
you
mentioned,
and
searches
associated
with
an
individual's
continued
detention,
so
the
strip
searching
example,
those
doctrines
have
discrete
justifications
that
limit
their
scope.
so
the
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine
permits
searches
for
officer
safety,
to
prevent
destruction
of
evidence,
and
at
least
in
the
vehicular
context,
to
search
for
evidence
related
to
the
offense
of
arrest.
now,
none
of
those
rationales
apply
here,
and
i
would
note
parenthetically
that
in
schmerber
v.
california,
this
court
suggested
that
the
search
incident
to
arrest
doctrine
would
not
permit
searches
into
the
body.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
am
not
disputing
that
the
government
has
an
interest
in
knowing
about
prior
offenses
that
an
individual
has
committed.
what
i
am
simply
saying
is
that
the
primary
purpose
of
dna
testing,
unlike
fingerprinting,
is
to
investigate
unsolved
crimes.
that
is
the
ordinary
interest
in
law
enforcement,
and
when
the
government
is
indicating--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--fingerprints
taken
upon
booking
are
primarily
used
for
the
purpose
of
identification,
and
by
identification
i
would
include
determining
whether
the
individual
had
a
prior
criminal
record,
because
as
iafis
is
currently
structured,
that
is
information
that
is
returned
once
there
is
a
hit
for
that
initial
search.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
i
think
fingerprinting
really
has
from
the
outset
served
the
purpose
of
identification,
because
fingerprinting
really
came
into
being
approximately
100
years
ago,
because
in
large
urban
areas
officers
could
no
longer
identify
individuals
on
sight.
now,
to
be
sure,
fingerprinting
does
serve
a
law
enforcement
purpose
as
well.
as
mr.
dreeben
indicated,
there
is
a
latent
fingerprint
database
that
roughly
corresponds
to--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
true.
but
again,
the
purpose
of
fingerprinting
as
it
developed
over
time
was
identification
in
the
sense
that
as
fingerprints
were
being
collected,
individuals
could
proceed
to
be
identified
based
on
prior--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--but
i
think
it's
important
to
realize,
justice
alito,
that
at
least
as
the
dna
system
is
currently
constituted,
when
an
arrestee's
profile
is
prepared,
it
is
compared
against
the
offender
and
arrestee
indices,
not
the
forensic
index.
and
indeed,
as
we
understand
it
and
i
think
mr.
dreeben's
discussion
of
this
is
probably
consistent
with
this,
at
least
on
the
federal
level,
it
is
not
permissible
to
take
that
profile
and
search
it
against
the
offender
and
arrestee
indices.
now
that
very
well
may
occur
in
certain
states.
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
that
is
what
takes
place
in
maryland.
but
again,
this
is
really
what
distinguishes
the
way
in
which
fingerprinting
is--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--sure.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we
think
it
means
determining
or
confirming
the
identity
of
an
individual.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
confirming,
for
instance,
in
this
case
that
the
individual
in
the
government's
custody
was
alonzo
king.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
but
73
million
people
are
in
the
criminal
offender--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--and
his
criminal
entity,
sure,
his
adjudicated
criminal
history,
which
can
also
be--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
breyer,
no,
i
think
with
respect
you
haven't.
with
regard
to
dna
testing,
a
dna
profile,
at
least
as
the
federal
system
is
configured,
is
compared
against
the
forensic
index.
that
is
the
index
of
samples
from
unsolved
crimes.
and
so
that
is
really
in
contradistinction
to
how
the
fingerprint
database
works.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
sure.
well,
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--justice
sotomayor,
assuming
that
this
court
does
not
accept
the
proposition
that
arrestees
are
somehow
subject
to
a
lessened
expectation
of
privacy--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--right.
and
the
only
other
potentially
applicable
exception
to
the
principle
that
warrantless,
suspicionless
searches
are
unconstitutional
is
the
special
needs
exception,
and
that
exception
looks
to
the
primary
purpose
of
the
program
at
issue.
and
the
mere
fact
that
dna
testing
could
be
used
for
other
purposes
wouldn't
necessarily
be
dispositive
of
the
inquiry.
if
the
primary
purpose
of
dna
testing
is
still
to
investigate
unsolved
crimes,
the
program
would
still
not
qualify
under
the
special
needs
doctrine.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i
think
that
it
could
be,
and
that
would
simply
be
because
you
would
have
a
system
where
dna
testing
is
essentially
being
used
as
fingerprinting
is
being
used
today.
but
again
i
don't
think--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--well,
there
is,
and
that
gets
me
back
finally
to
the
rest
of
justice
breyer's
question
from
a
few
minutes
ago,
because
justice
breyer
had
kind
of
asked
how
the
analysis
should
work
in
the
event
that
the
court
were
to
proceed
to
balancing.
and
so
i
just
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
relevant
privacy
interests
and
the
relevant
governmental
interests
and
to
explain
why
we
think
that
the
relevant
privacy
interests
outweigh
those
governmental
interests.
on
the
privacy
side
of
the
ledger,
we
certainly
believe
that
there
are
profound
privacy
concerns
associated
with
the
government's
collection
of
an
individual's
dna.
and
leaving
aside
the
question
of
how
much
personal
information
is
contained
in
the
13
loci
--
and
we
certainly
think
that
there
is
significant
personal
information
even
as
to
those
loci
--
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
dispute
that
when
you
evaluate
the
entirety
of
an
individual's
dna,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
personal
information
contained
there.
and
in
our
view,
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
when
engaging
in
balancing.
now,
the
government's
response
to
that
is
essentially
the
“
just
trust
us
”
defense;
namely
that
the
government
is
not
looking
at
all
that
information,
it
is
only
looking
at
a
certain
subset
of
that
information.
but
that
has
never
been
how
this
court
has
analyzed
privacy
interests,
at
least
outside
the
special
needs
context.
probably
the
closest
analog
is
this
court's
decision
in
tyler
v.
united
states,
where
the
court
said
that
it
was
of
no
moment
that
the
heat-sensing
device
that
was
at
issue
in
that
case
did
not
detect
any
information
about
the
intimate
details
of
activities
within
the
home.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
we
believe
that
there
might
still
be
--
indeed,
we
think
the
better
view
under
this
court's
cases
is
that
there
would
still
be
a
fourth
amendment
search
there.
the
only
difference
would
be
that
you
don't
have
the
intrusion
into
the
body
that
makes
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
search
here
an
easy
one.
now,
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
governmental--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--the
argument
would
be
that
the
subsequent
analysis
of
the
dna
nevertheless
still
constitutes
a
search.
and
the
most
significant
decision
on
this
issue
to
date
is
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
united
states
v.
davis,
which
i
would
encourage
you
to
look
at
if
you
are
interested
in
this
issue,
because
it
holds
that
the
extraction
of
the
dna
from
an
item
that
was
lawfully
in
the
government's
custody
still
constitutes
a
search.
let
me
say
just
a
word,
though,
about
the
governmental
side
of
the
balance
here,
because
i
think
this
is
important.
ms.
winfree
started
with
the
statistics
about
the
efficacy
of
dna
testing
of
arrestees,
but
our
submission
is
simply
that
when
you
look
at
the
relevant
subset
of
cases,
namely
individuals
who
have
been
arrested
but
who
are
not
subsequently
convicted
of
the
offense
of
arrest,
the
law
enforcement
value
of
dna
testing
is
relatively
modest.
my
understanding
is
that--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
correct.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
well,
my
client--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--that
is
--
my
client
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
arrest,
to
be
sure.
but
under
the
maryland
statute
that
crime
was
not
a
serious
enough
crime
to
qualify
for
dna
collection
at
that
point.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
we
think
that
it
would
be
permissible
to
collect
dna
from
any
individual
who
has
been
convicted
and
is
subjected
to
the
continued
supervision
of
the
state.
and
that
is
simply
because
those
individuals
have
a
lessened
expectation
of
privacy.
but
just
to
get
on
the
table--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--we
don't
--
we
don't
think
in
that
circumstance,
justice
ginsburg,
that
the
government
would
have
to
destroy
the
dna
sample.
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
i'm
sorry?
a
felon
who
has
been--
mr.
kannon
k.
shanmugam
--i
would
not
say
that
that
person
has
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy.
what
i
would
say
is
that
there
are
certain
intrusions
on
privacy,
some
of
which
are
quite
substantial,
that
are
permissible
because
there
are
justifications
unique
to
the
arrest.
so
in
florence,
this
court
permitted
the
strip
search
of
an
individual
who
is
being
admitted
into
the
general
jail
population
based
on
the
special
need
of
ensuring
prison
safety
and
preventing
contraband
from
being
introduced
into
the
prison.
