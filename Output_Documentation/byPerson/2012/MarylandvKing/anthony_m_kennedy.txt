why

just
--
just
like
taking
the
pockets
out

and
seeing
what's
in
the

and
so
forth
is
a

they

so
his

he

i

a
person
has
been
arrested
for
a
felony
and
is
in

do
the
police,
does
the
justice
system
have
an
interest
in
knowing
whether
that
person
committed
other
crimes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
is
whether
or
not
the
police
who
have
john
doe
in
custody
for
a
felony
have
an
interest
in
knowing
at
the
outset
or
within
a
few
weeks
time
whether
or
not
that
person
has
committed
other
crimes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
also
have
a
reason
for
keeping
him
in
custody.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
my
question
is,
do
they
have
an
interest
and
a
legitimate
interest
in
knowing
if
that
person
has
committed
other
crimes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
are
also
talking
about
identity.
i
assume
that
in
maryland
and
in
a
number
of
states
the
time
between
release
on
bail
and
return
for
trial
is
more
than
four
months.
and
if
it's
found
as
an
identity
matter
that
this
person
has
a
criminal
record
or
that
they
are
--
is
suspected
of
serious
crimes,
that
is
a
mandatory
ground
for
reconsideration
of
bail.
and
you
say
there
is
no
interest
in
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
a
felon
who's
been
arrested
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
at
the
time
of
arrest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
a
felon
--
does
a
person
who
has
been
arrested
for
a
felony
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
at
the
time
of
his
arrest?
justice
anthony

in
2003,
a
man
concealing
his
face
and
armed
with
a
gun
broke
into
a
woman's
home
in
salisbury,
maryland.
he
raped
her.
the
police
were
unable
to
apprehend
the
assailant
but
they
did
obtain
from
the
victim
a
sample
of
his
dna.
some
six
years
later,
in
2009,
alonzo
king,
who
is
the
respondent
here,
was
arrested
in
maryland
for
a
different
crime.
he
was
arrested
for
assault
while
brandishing
a
weapon
and
this
was
an
arrest
for
a
serious
offense
as
defined
by
maryland
law.
as
part
of
a
routine
booking
procedure
for
serious
offenses
authorized
by
maryland
law,
king's
dna
was
taken
when
he
was
arrested.
now
to
take
a
dna
sample,
officers
have
the
subject
to
open
his
mouth,
they
use
a
swab
that
looks
like
a
long
q-tip
to
take
the
sample.
now
the
procedure
is
routine
and
painless.
king's
dna
was
found
to
match
the
dna
taken
from
the
salisbury
rape
victim.
this
information
led
to
king's
trial
and
conviction
for
the
rape.
codis
is
the
dna
nationwide
database
that's
used
to
connect
dna
laboratories
for
this
matching
process,
they're
connected
nationwide
by
codis.
in
this
case,
it
took
about
four
months
from
the
time
the
sample
was
first
taken
from
king
until
the
report
matching
dna
from
the
rape
was
received.
but
the
time
was
often
faster
and
in
any
event,
the
bail
determination
or
actual
release
of
the
serious
offender
as
a
routine
matter
before
trial,
can
take
weeks
or
months.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
set
aside
king's
rape
conviction.
it
ruled
that
the
dna
taken
when
king
was
arrested
in
2009
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
held
that
it
was
a
violation
because
it
was
an
unreasonable
search.
this
court
now
reverses
the
judgment
of
the
maryland
court.
the
advent
of
dna
technology
is
one
of
the
most
significant
scientific
advances
of
our
era.
the
full
potential
for
use
of
genetic
markers
in
science
and
medicine
is
still
being
explored,
but
the
utility
of
dna
identification
in
the
criminal
justice
system
is
already
undisputed.
although
the
dna
sample
procedure
used
here
presents
a
question
this
court
has
not
yet
addressed,
the
framework
for
deciding
the
issue
was
well
established.
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
unreasonable
search
and
seizures.
there
can
be
no
dispute
that
the
dna
swab
process
is
a
search.
but
the
fact
that
a
dna
swab
is
a
much
more
gentle
process
than
say
a
needle
that's
used
to
withdraw
blood
is
of
central
relevance
in
determining
whether
the
search
is
reasonable.
the
ultimate
measure
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
governmental
search
is
reasonableness.
in
ruling
that
the
search
was
reasonable,
today's
opinion
explains
that
the
legitimate
government
interest
served
by
a
dna
identification
is
one
that
is
well
established,
the
need
for
law
enforcement
officers
in
a
safe
and
accurate
way
to
process
and
identify
the
persons
they
must
take
into
custody.
when
probable
cause
exists
to
remove
an
individual
from
the
normal
channels
of
society
on
charges
for
a
serious
offense
and
hold
him
with
proper
safeguards
in
legal
custody
or
release
him
on
bail
with
adequate
conditions,
dna
identification
plays
a
critical
role
in
serving
those
interests.
an
individual's
identity
is
more
than
just
his
name
or
social
security
number.
the
government's
interest
in
identification
goes
beyond
ensuring
that
the
proper
name
is
typed
on
the
indictment.
a
suspect's
criminal
history
is
a
critical
part
of
his
identity.
police
already
seek
this
information
using
a
variety
of
long
approved
means,
notably
the
comparison
of
an
arrestee's
fingerprints
against
databases
of
known
criminals
and
unsolved
crimes.
identification
necessarily
entails
searching
public
and
police
records
to
see
what
is
already
known
about
an
arrestee.
dna
is
another
means
of
identification
used
to
connect
the
arrestee
with
his
or
her
public
persona
as
reflected
in
records
of
his
or
her
actions
that
are
available
to
the
police.
this
includes
matching
to
other
dna
samples
previously
collected
from
crime
scenes.
this
information
found
in
official
records
is
checked
as
a
routine
matter
to
produce
a
more
comprehensive
record
of
the
suspect's
complete
identity.
in
this
respect,
an
arrestee's
codis
profile
is
a
different
form
of
identification
than
a
name
or
fingerprint
but
its
function
is
the
same.
now
among
the
many
reasons
for
this
identification,
why
this
identification
is
important
is
to
determine
whether
an
arrestee
can
be
released
pending
trial.
dna
identification
establishing
more
about
the
person's
identity
and
background
can
provide
critical
information
relevant
to
the
conditions
of
his
release
and
whether
to
revisit
an
initial
release
determination
and
as
said
earlier,
sometimes
this
process
takes
months
in
any
event.
pre-trial
release
is
the
most
serious
responsibility.
it
is
reasonable
in
all
respects
for
the
state
to
use
an
accepted
database
to
determine
if
an
arrestee
is
the
object
of
suspicion
in
other
serious
crimes,
suspicion
that
may
provide
a
strong
incentive
for
the
arrestee
to
escape
or
to
flee
on
--
after
him
being
released.
given
the
importance
of
dna
and
the
identification
of
police
records
pertaining
to
arrestees
and
the
need
to
refine
and
confirm
that
identity
for
its
important
bearing
on
the
decision
to
continue
release
on
bail
or
impose
new
conditions
or
to
revoke
bail,
dna
serves
an
essential
purpose
despite
the
existence
of
delays
such
as
the
delay
that
occurred
in
this
case.
by
comparison
to
this
substantial
government
interest
and
the
unique
effectiveness
of
dna
identification,
the
intrusion
of
a
cheek
swab
to
obtain
a
dna
sample
is
a
minimum
one.
in
addition,
the
processing
of
king's
dna
did
not
intrude
on
his
privacy.
the
codis
points
of
comparison
come
from
non-coding
parts
of
the
dna
that
do
not
reveal
genetic
traits
of
the
arrestee
and
maryland
law
provides
a
substantial
statutory
protection
system
to
guard
against
further
invasion
of
privacy.
for
these
reasons
and
others
set
forth
in
the
opinion
published
today,
the
court
concludes
that
dna
identification
of
arrestees
is
a
reasonable
search
that
can
be
considered
part
of
a
routine
booking
procedure.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
is
reversed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
sotomayor,
and
kagan
join.
