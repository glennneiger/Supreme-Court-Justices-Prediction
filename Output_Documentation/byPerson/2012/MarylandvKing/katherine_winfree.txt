ms.
katherine
winfree
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
2009,
when
maryland
began
to
collect
dna
samples
from
arrestees
charged
with
violent
crimes
and
burglary,
there
had
been
225
matches,
75
prosecutions
and
42
convictions,
including
that
of
respondent
king.
ms.
katherine
winfree
well,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
it
does,
in
fact,
point
out
the
fact
that
--
that
the
statute
is
working,
and
in
the
state's
view
the
act
is
constitutional.
ms.
katherine
winfree
no,
not
--
not
just
to
identify
people.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
enable
the
state
to
identify
perpetrators
of
serious
crimes
and
--
and
to
use
the
information
to
make
bail
determinations
for
people
who
are
validly
in
their
custody.
ms.
katherine
winfree
that's
true,
justice
sotomayor.
ms.
katherine
winfree
he
was
detained
anyway.
ms.
katherine
winfree
well--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--at
this
point,
you're
absolutely
correct,
justice
sotomayor.
we
don't
use
it
routinely
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
for
one,
as
in
mr.
king's
case,
there
has
been
in
the
past
a
more
substantial
delay
in
getting
those
results
back.
our
--
our
lab
now
is
getting
results
between
11
and
17
days.
now,
that,
of
course--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--no,
that's
the
whole
--
that's
the
whole
process,
justice
sotomayor.
it's
for
getting
the
sample
and
getting
it
into
the
system,
the
dna
profile
and
getting
the
match
back.
that's
what
we're
being
told.
it's
from
11
to
17
days.
now,
of
course,
that
wouldn't
be
timely
for
that
first
bail
determination,
but
the
state
under
maryland's
procedure
certainly
has
the
ability
to
go
back
to
--
to
the
judge
and
ask
that
sentence
--
or
that
--
i'm
sorry
--
that
bail
determination
to
be
modified.
and
in
point
of
fact,
though,
we
don't
have
any
particular
statistics
in
maryland.
in
california's
amicus
brief,
which
was
joined
by
the
49
other
states
and
d.c.
and
puerto
rico,
they
actually
do
cite
two
particular
examples
where
--
where
two
people,
castillo
and
shamblin,
were
arrested.
one
was
arrested
on
a
credit
card
charge
and
another
on
a
drug
charge.
mr.
castillo
was
actually
released
on
his
--
on
or
and
when
his
sample
was
matched,
it
came
back
to
a
--
an
unsolved
rape
and
sodomy
and
his
or
was
revoked.
in
mr.
shamblin's
case,
he
was
granted
diversion,
because
his
drug
charge
is
a
relatively
low
level
offense
and
when
the
match
came
back,
it
--
it
tied
him
to
a
rape
and
murder.
his
diversion
was
revoked,
and
he's
currently
pending
charge
--
pending
trial
on
both
of
those
charges.
ms.
katherine
winfree
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
ms.
katherine
winfree
well,
in
maryland,
it's
not
just
the
fact
that
we
have
those
--
those
violent
crimes
and
burglaries.
actually,
we
don't
collect
dna
unless
someone
is
physically
taken
into
custody.
now,
with
respect
to--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--well,
what
i
would
say
to
that
is
that
with
respect
to
a
traffic
stop,
this
court
said
in
berkheimer
that
a
motorist
has
an
expectation
that
a
traffic
stop
is
going
to
be
relatively
brief
and
temporary,
that
he
or
she
will
be
given
a
citation
and
sent
on
their
way.
ms.
katherine
winfree
it
doesn't
take
long,
but
what
i
was
suggesting
is
that
because
of
the
nature
of
a
traffic
stop,
this
court
might
well
decide
that
a
motorist
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
not
to--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--in
a
terry
--
well,
this
court,
i
guess,
we
would
look
at
two
--
one
case
in
particular,
this
court's
case
--
decision
in
hayes
v.
florida.
that
involved
a
defendant
who
was
taken
into
custody,
so
his
--
he
was
not
arrested,
but
taken
into
custody
for
--
to
get
his
fingerprints,
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
--
that
was
not
constitutional.
but
the
court
further
said
that
there
could
be
a
circumstance
in
a
terry
stop
if
the
officer
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
the
individual
was--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
i
could
go
back
to
your
question
about
the
terry
stop.
the
cornerstone
of
our
--
and
i
do
believe
that
this
court
could
--
could
--
who
knows
how
this
court
would
come
out
in
that
situation,
but
i
think
in
terms
of
our
argument,
the
corner--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--well,
happily
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
one
today.
but
what
i
--
the
cornerstone
of
our
argument
is
that
when
an
individual
is
taken
into
custody,
an
individual
is
arrested
on
a
probable
cause,
on
a
probable
cause
arrest,
that
person
by
virtue
of
being
in
that
class
of
individuals
whose
conduct
has
led
the
police
to
arrest
him
on
--
based
on
probable
cause
surrenders
a
substantial
amount
of
liberty
and
privacy.
ms.
katherine
winfree
that's
correct,
justice
kagan.
ms.
katherine
winfree
that's
correct.
ms.
katherine
winfree
that's
correct.
but
what
we're
seizing
here
is
not
evidence
of
crime,
what
it
is,
is
information
related
to
that
person's
dna
profile.
those
26
numbers--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--well,
i
would
say
there's
a
very
real
distinction
between
the
police
generally
rummaging
in
your
home
to
look
for
evidence
that
might
relate
to
your
personal
papers
and
your
thoughts.
it's
a
very
real
difference
there
than
swabbing
the
inside
of
an
arrestee's
cheek
to
determine
what
that
person's
codis
dna
profile
is.
it's
looking
only
at
26
numbers
that
tell
us
nothing
more
about
that
individual.
ms.
katherine
winfree
i
think
the
difference
there
is
these
people
are
lawfully
in
custody
having
been
arrested
based
on
probable
cause.
and
that--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--well--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--well,
if
i
could
start
at
the
back
end
of
your
question,
justice
sotomayor,
we're
not
suggesting
and
this
statute
doesn't
permit
the
state
or
police
to
search
an
arrestee's
home
or
his
person
beyond
--
beyond
simply
swabbing
the
cheek
for
the
dna.
now,
in
terms
of
the
--
the
individual's
relationship
to
the
state,
an
arrestee
is
not
that
dissimilar.
there
is
obviously
a
range
of
--
of
relationships
with
the
state.
those
of
us
who
are
out
on
the
street,
ordinary
citizens
are
at
one
end,
people
who
are
imprisoned
upon
conviction
are
at
the
other
end.
and
--
but
in
terms
of
when
an
arrestee
is
physically
in
custody,
he
has
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
and
that's
what
makes,
in
our
view,
it
makes
this
case
more
similar.
to
be
sure,
this
is
not
samson,
there's
no
--
there's
no
one
case
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
that's
exactly
like
this.
ms.
katherine
winfree
well--
ms.
katherine
winfree
--well,
those
are
different
situations,
justice
sotomayor.
we're
not
suggesting
that
the
police
could
swab
a
student
for
--
for
a
dna
sample.
we're
talking
about
a
special
class
of
people
who
by
their
conduct
have
--
have
been
arrested
based
on
probable
cause.
ms.
katherine
winfree
yes,
justice
breyer.
ms.
katherine
winfree
yes,
justice
breyer.
ms.
katherine
winfree
that's
absolutely
correct.
ms.
katherine
winfree
yes.
ms.
katherine
winfree
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
ms.
katherine
winfree
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
katherine
winfree
on
the
question
of
rapid
dna,
the
fbi
estimates
that
we're
about
18
to
24
months
away
from
that
world,
and
i
would
cite
the
national
district
attorneys
association's
amicus
brief
on
page
20
where
it
discusses
the
--
that
this
is
not
science
fiction.
so
we
are
very,
very
close
to
that.
and
i
wanted
to
just
address
a
couple
of
the
questions
that
arose
during
respondent's
presentation.
justice
kennedy,
the
state
does
have
a
compelling
need
and
a
compelling
interest
in
knowing
who
is
in
its
custody,
and
arrestees
do
not
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
their
identity.
we
have
a
legitimate
and
compelling
need
to
identify
suspects
and
to
aid
in
solving
crimes.
and
our
--
and
our
definition
of
what
identification
is,
is
somewhat
broader
than
respondent's.
it's
not
just
what
his
name
is
and
what
his
face
is
and
what
his
fingerprints
show.
it
is
that
codis
dna
profile,
those
26
numbers.
so
in
our
view
that's
a
broader
definition
of
identity.
and
i
wanted
also
just
finally
to
address
justice
alito's
question.
this
is
the
fingerprinting
of
the
21st
century,
but
it's
better.
typically
dna
evidence
is
used
to
identify
rapes
and
murderers.
fingerprints
typically
do
not
solve
those
kinds
of
crimes.
and
if
the
primary
purpose
of
fingerprinting
is
just
to
identify,
it
also
is
used
--
fingerprinting
now
is
used,
the
prints
are
compared
against
the
latent
database
in
iafis
and
they
are
used
to
solve
crimes.
but
they
typically
don't
solve
the
kind
of
crimes
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
and
it
wouldn't
have
been
solved
in
mr.
--
in
mr.
king's
case.
ms.
katherine
winfree
well,
that's
really
only
one
component
of
our
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
certainly
with
respect
to
a
bail
determination
we
will
be
able
to
make
it
more
rapidly
at
the
time
that
rapid
dna
comes
into
effect.
ms.
katherine
winfree
it
has
a
corollary
purpose,
justice
scalia.
what
we
are
suggesting
and
arguing
is
that
solving
crimes,
to
be
sure,
is
the
key
component,
but
in
solving
crimes
and
connecting
an
arrestee
to
a
crime
that's
unsolved
informs
a
judge's
determination
about
whether
to
release
that
individual.
and
as
mr.
dreeben
said,
bail
modifications
can
happen,
they
do
happen
all
the
time.
and
in
maryland,
it's
going
to
have
--
it's
going
to
be
happening
before
rapid
dna.
right
now
we
are
able
to
make
that
determination
in
a
period
between
11
and
17
days.
so
we
are
not
asking
you
to
base
your
decision
on
the
futuristic
world,
which
is
really
only
2
years
out
with
rapid
dna
anyway.
but
we
can
make
those
bail
determinations
now
and
in
fact
they
are
important
for
where
we
house
prisoners
and
how
we
supervise
them
in
custody.
