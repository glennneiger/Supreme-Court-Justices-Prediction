how
about
a
terry
stop?
a
terry
stop?
justice

but
these
--
these
are
all
cases,
i
mean,
the
dominant
use
is
to
solve
what
they
call
cold
--
cold
cases,
and
you
gave
one
example.
this
case
is
another.
a
rape
committed
6
years
before,
right?
and
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion,
there
was
no
nothing,
right?
and
the
suspicion
comes
up
only
because
the
dna
sample
comes
back
as
a
match.
so
is
it
the
--
this
is
a
--
a
very
reliable
tool,
but
it's
not
based
on
any
kind
of
suspicion
of
the
individual
who's
being
subjected
to
it,
right?

mr.
dreeben,
can
you
explain
how
it
works,
mechanically?
because
i
understand,
at
least
maybe
this
is
just
the
maryland
statute,
but
if
you
can't
use
the
swab
that
is
taken
from
the
arrestee
when
he
is
arrested
--
it
can't
be
used,
it's
inadmissible
--
then
you
do
it
again.
you
do
it
--
but
what
it
does
supply
is
probable
cause,
because
you
found
out
that
he
was
a
perpetrator
of
a
rape
6
years
ago.
then
you
have
probable
cause
and
you
get
a
warrant
and
do
it
again.
what
--
what
is
the
reason
for
the
doubling
--
the
doing
it
twice?

i
thought
fingerprinting
--
mr.
shanmugam,
i
thought
fingerprinting
was
used
to
determine
whether
they
--
the
person
has
a
record.
we
have
this
person
and
now
we
check
the
fingerprints
to
find
out
if
he
has
a
prior
record,
that's
different
from
to
find
out
if
he
has
committed
a
crime
that
we
don't
know
about.
but
are
fingerprints
used
to
determine
whether
the
person
has
a
prior
record?
justice
ruth

when
they're
no
longer
in
the
custody
of
the
state,
does
the
government
have
to
destroy
it?
they
served
their
time
and
their
privileges
have
been
restored.
