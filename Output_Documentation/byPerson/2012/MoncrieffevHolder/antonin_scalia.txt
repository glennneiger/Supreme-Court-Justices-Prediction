material
weight
says
less
than
1
ounce--
justice

--parentheses,

grams.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
conviction
mean?
you
say
the
categorical
approach.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
categorical
statute
under
which
you
have
been
convicted
or,
as
you
seem
to
be
saying,
the
indictment?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
he
convicted
of
that
or
is
he
convicted
of
violating
georgia
code
16-13,
whatever
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i
thought
that
when
congress
enacted
this
provision
there
was
not
the
distinction
between
elements
and
sentencing
factors
that
we
now
have,
that
the
statute
was
enacted,
in
other
words,
before
apprendi.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be,
but
it
certainly
goes
to
your
argument
that
congress
had
in
mind
some
distinction
between
elements
and
sentencing
factors.
