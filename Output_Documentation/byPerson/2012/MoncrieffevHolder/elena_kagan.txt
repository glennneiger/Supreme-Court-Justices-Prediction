justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
goldstein,
assuming
he
was
convicted
of
that,
as
you
suggest,
you
have
an
underinclusiveness
problem.
the
government
has
an
overinclusiveness
problem.
justice
elena
kagan
if
you
assume
that
this
statute
covers
and
is
regularly
used
to
cover
both
sets
of
people,
both
people
with
these
very
minor
offenses
and
people
with
much
more
major
offenses--
justice
elena
kagan
--the
at
least
apparent
attractiveness
of
the
government's
position
is
that
they've
tried
to
cure
their
overinclusiveness
problem,
and
they
have
done
it
by
sticking
on
--
and,
you
know,
one
can
ask
where
this
comes
from
in
the
statute--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
they
have
done
it
by
sticking
on
something
that
attempts
to
address
their
overinclusiveness
problem,
so
that
people
who
are
really
misdemeanants
get
classified
as
misdemeanants,
and
people
who
are
really
aggravated
felons
get
classified
that
way.
and
you
have
no
similar
cure
for
your
underinclusiveness
problem,
so
why
shouldn't
we
go
with
their
problem,
which
at
least
attempts
to
solve
this
problem?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
that
the
attorney
general
could
just
issue
some
kind
of
directive
telling
all
administrative
law
judges
and
officials
to
deny
cancellation
of
removal
to
anybody
who
commits
these
kinds
of
offenses?
justice
elena
kagan
to
do
the
exact
same
thing--
justice
elena
kagan
--but
through--
justice
elena
kagan
--an
attorney
general
directive.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
shah,
the
board
may
have
been
doing
these
inquiries,
but
i
just
don't
understand
the
statutory
argument,
because
the
way
the
statute
--
the
way
your
own
statutory
argument
runs
is
that
if
the
conviction,
the
state
conviction,
was
a
conviction
for
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
then
those
are
the
elements
of
a
federal
--
of
a
federal
felony.
and
so
the
person
--
and
an
aggravated
felony.
so
you
say
under
the
elements
approach,
this
person
has
committed
an
aggravated
felony.
and
the
statutory
directive
is
that
when
a
person
has
committed
an
aggravated
felony,
he
is
deportable,
and
there
is
no
exercise
of
discretion
that
can
come
into
play.
and
so
your
whole
back-end
process,
which
says,
oh,
well,
maybe
not,
maybe
he's
not
automatically
deportable,
it
doesn't
come
from
the
statute,
and
it
seems
to
run
into
the
statutory
language
which
says
an
aggravated
felon
must
be
deported,
the
end.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
what
the
statute
says,
and
that's
what
your
own
statutory
analysis
says.
justice
elena
kagan
no,
i'll
just
read
you,
mr.
shah,
this
sentence
from
your
brief,
and
i
could
read
you
a
thousand
of
these
in
your
brief:
"because
petitioner's
georgia
conviction
necessarily
established
that
he
knowingly
possessed
marijuana
with
the
specific
intent
to
distribute
it,
that
conviction
constitutes
an
aggravated
felony.
"
well,
if
that
conviction
constitutes
an
aggravated
felony,
he
has
to
be
deported
and
there
is
no
exercise
of
discretion
that
this
statute
allows.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
now
you've
just
put
in
words
into
your
brief.
justice
elena
kagan
--and
--
and
really,
truly
you
say
this
10
or
15
times.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
shah,
i
think
the
problem
with
your
main
argument
is
that
it
leads
you
to
a
result
that
you
don't
want
to
accept,
because
your
main
argument
is
all
we've
done
in
our
past
cases,
and
i
can
argue
with
this,
but
your
argument
is
all
we've
done
is
compare
the
elements.
but
if
all
we
do
is
compare
the
elements,
then
we
don't
get
to
your
discretionary
scheme
in
which
we
also
admit
evidence
of
the
case-specific
nature
of
the
offense.
i
mean,
so
your
arguments
all
go
towards
a
very
purist
solution.
and
then
you
say,
oh,
no,
that's
a
crazy
solution.
it's
a
crazy
solution
because
we
would
wind
up
saying
that
misdemeanants
like
this
person,
like
people
who
are
actually
convicted
under
(b)(4)
who
are
clearly
misdemeanants,
would
wind
up
as
aggravated
felons
and
--
and
must
be
deported.
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
think
we
really
have
an
agreement--
justice
elena
kagan
--because
it
seems
to
me
that
carachuri
actually
says
we
don't
just
look
to
elements.
but
if
we
were
just
to
look
to
elements
in
the
way
you're
arguing
for,
we
wouldn't
get
the
result
that
you're
arguing
for.
justice
elena
kagan
i
don't
think
that
that
is
quite
right,
mr.
shah,
because
if
you
read
this
statute,
what
it
most
looks
like
is
that
congress
is
simply
classifying
two
different
kinds
of
conduct.
congress
has
the
--
the
social
sharing
conduct,
and
that's
in
one
section.
and
the
everything
else,
the
more
dangerous
conduct,
is
in
another
section.
and
so
it's
not
something
where
it's
like,
oh,
you're
trying
to
get
them
to
negate
a
specific
--
a
point.
congress
has
created
two
separate
sections,
two
--
and
one
is
a
felony,
and
one
is
a
misdemeanor.
and
that's
the
real
way
to
understand
this
statute.
and
then,
the
categorical
approach
suggests,
well,
in
that
case,
we
accept
the
underinclusion
rather
than
the
overinclusion.
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i
don't
understand,
mr.
shah.
that
seems
just
a
question
of
labeling
to
me.
i
mean,
why
should
we
--
why
should
we
accept
that
labeling
rather
than,
look,
what
congress
did
here
was
to
say
that
certain
kinds
of
offenses
are
felonies
deserving
of
grave
punishment,
and
other
kinds
of
offenses
are
misdemeanors
deserving
of
less
than
a
year
in
prison,
and
we
see
those
categories
of
conduct
differently.
and
if
you
are
saying
that
if
congress
had
said
two
separate
offenses,
then
the
categorical
approach
means
that
mr.
goldstein's
client
wins,
i
guess
i
just
don't
get
what
in
this
statute
suggests
something
different
for
that.
