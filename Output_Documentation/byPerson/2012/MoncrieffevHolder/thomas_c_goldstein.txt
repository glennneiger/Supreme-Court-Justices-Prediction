mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you
very
much.
may
it
please
the
court:
today's
undercard
is
an
immigration
case.
adrian
moncrieffe
was
convicted
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
marijuana
under
georgia
law.
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
he
was
thereby
convicted
of
a
controlled
substances
offense,
which
is
a
deportable
offense,
but
also
an
aggravated
felony
of
illicit
trafficking
in
drugs,
which
would
mean
that
the
attorney
general
has
no
discretion
to
cancel
his
removal.
now,
everyone
agrees
that
under
the
georgia
statute,
there
is
going
to
be
some
conduct
that
would
be
a
federal
felony,
but
it's
also
undisputed
that
the
georgia
statute
regularly
involves
prosecutions
that
would
be
federal
misdemeanors.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
they
were
not.
we
do
not
--
we
attempted
very
hard
to
collect
them.
this
is
the
information
i
can
give
you
about
federal
and
state
prosecutions
of
marijuana
cases
in
the
united
states.
in
the
state
system,
the
most
recent
available
data
--
it
was
published
by
the
department
of
justice
in
2006,
but
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
it's
changed
materially
--
in
2006,
there
were
roughly
750,000
prosecutions
in
the
states
for
marijuana
offenses.
by
contrast,
in
the
federal
system,
we
have
data
from
2010.
and
we
have
two
different
kinds
of
data
here
that
is
a
little
bit
more
granular,
and
that
is
for
prosecutions
under
841(b)(1),
which
is
the
trafficking
provision,
there
were
6,200
cases.
for
prosecutions
under
841(b)(4),
which
is
the
provision
we
say
you
ought
to
look
at
here,
and
844,
which
is
the
possession
provision,
combined,
there
were
only
93
prosecutions
in
2010.
and
what
we
think
that
illustrates
is
that
there
is
a
massive
amount
of
activity
in
the
states
doing
things
that
show
that
this
--
and
this
case
is
perfectly
commonplace,
we
think.
it's
consistent
with
the
other
cases
that
we've
seen
published
by
the
bia.
adrian
moncrieffe
possessed--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yeah.
i
apologize.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
that's
right.
the
georgia
statute,
which
just
refers
to
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
contemplates
both
social
sharing
of
marijuana
--
this
case,
for
example,
1.3
grams
of
marijuana,
which
is
less
than--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
although
this
is
--
we
believe
the
case
is
proceeding
under
the
categorical
approach,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
so
let
me
take
you
to
two
places.
one
is
going
to
be
at
the
back
of
the
blue
brief,
where
we
have
the
chemist's
report.
so
page
19.
this
is
from
the
--
the
record
in
the
immigration
proceedings.
and
on
page
19
of
the
appendix
to
our
blue
brief
--
we
just
agreed,
because
there
was
so
little
record
material,
that
we
wouldn't
have
a
joint
appendix
in
the
case.
we
just
published
it
at
the
end
of
our
brief
--
it
says,
"material
weight
less
than
1
ounce;
approximate
weight
is
1.3
grams.
"
and
for
those
of
us
who've
been
fortunate
enough
not
to
experience
the
drug
laws
a
lot,
that's
less
than
half
the
weight
of
this
penny.
so
it's,
i
think
everybody
agrees,
a
small
amount.
now,
on
the
question
of
no
remuneration,
what
i
have
to
offer
you
is
the
georgia
statute--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sorry.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yeah.
1.3
grams.
1.3.
that's
very,
very,
very,
very
little.
so
then,
on
the
question
of
remuneration
--
and
i
should
just
step
back
and
explain,
the
reason
we're
talking
about
this
is
that
the
federal
misdemeanor
provision,
841(b)(4),
says
that
it's
not
a
felony,
and
thus,
it
wouldn't
be
an
aggravated
felony,
if
it's
a
small
amount
and
no
remuneration.
and
justice
ginsburg
asked
about
the
--
what's
in
the
record
about
that.
now,
there
isn't
record
evidence
about
no
remuneration,
but
there
is
one
significant
fact.
and
to
know
that
fact,
you
have
to
look
at
the
georgia
statute,
which
is
also
at
the
end
of
our
brief.
it's
on
page
9
of
our
appendix.
this
is
the
statute
he
was
prosecuted
under.
it's
the
second
provision.
section
16-13-30(j)(1).
and
i'll
just
read
it.
"it
is
unlawful
for
any
person
to
possess,
have
under
his
control,
manufacture,
deliver,
distribute,
dispense,
administer,
purchase,
sell.
"
--sell
--
"or
possess
with
intent
to
distribute
marijuana.
"
and
he
was
not
charged
with
and
he
was
not
convicted
of
selling,
and
so
we
think
that
should
negative
any
indication
--
any
implication
that
he
might
have
gotten
remuneration
for
this.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
under
our
rule,
the
plea
colloquy
is
irrelevant,
but
we
would
win
under
a
rule
in
which
it
was
relevant.
so,
to
start
with
the
former,
we
say
that
the
categorical
rule
applies.
there's
no
--
the
only
reason
that
you
would
look
at
the
modified
categorical
approach
here
is
to
know
that
it
was
a
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
conviction
rather
than
a
sale
conviction,
but
that
evidence
would
still
come
in.
it
would
be
highly
relevant.
it's
the
basis
that
this
court
explained
in
carachuri-rosendo,
that
the
immigration
judge
would
deny
cancellation
of
removal.
right?
that
factor
would
still
be
highly
relevant.
the
attorney
general
would
exercise
his
discretion
in
such
a
case.
now--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--you
said
still
felons.
we--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
so,
you
know,
lawyers
often
try
and
avoid
the
strength
of
the
other
side's
case.
and
so
let
me
just
confront
what
i
think
is
a
big
argument
of
theirs.
they
say
our
position
is
underinclusive
because
the
georgia
statute
does
include
conduct
that
would
be
a
felony.
you
just
gave
an
example
of
it.
but
our
point
is
that
our
underinclusivity
is
a
problem,
but
it's
not
a
big
problem.
it's
not
as
big
as
their
problem.
because,
as
this
court
explained
in
carachuri-rosendo,
the
offense
still
is
removable,
and
the
attorney
general
will
just
deny
cancellation
of
removal.
now,
the
reason
they
have
a
much
bigger
practical
problem
is
that
their
rule
is
overinclusive.
it
treats
as
felonies
some
convictions
that
should
be
misdemeanors.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
because
i
don't
think
anybody
would
believe
me
if
i
went
to
an
immigration
judge
and
i
said,
judge,
i
promise,
i
promise
that
the
fact
that
this
isn't
a
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
case
means
that
there
are
never
cases
in--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
--
i
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
have
not
read
this
court's
cases
to
suggest
that
we
call
the
state
attorneys.
we
have
read
the
court's
cases
to
engage
in
ordinary
statutory
construction,
and
felony--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
because
the
government's
position
is,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
has
agreed
with
it
--
and
just
to
--
just
to
make
sure
everyone
is
on
the
same
page,
and
that
is,
the
federal
statute
is
triggered
by
a
conviction.
justice
breyer
has
just
made
the
point
that,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
he
was
not
even
convicted
because
he
got
first
offender
treatment
here,
which
is
a
point
in
our
favor.
it
does
show
that
it
was
a
small
and
non-serious
offense.
the
reason
is
that
there
is
a
federal
definition
of
convicted
that's
independent
of
the
state
definition
of
convicted.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
that's
correct.
and
it's
an
even
stronger
point
in
our
favor,
because
worse
than
interviewing
four
district
attorneys
is
having
a
fact-bound
inquiry
into
every
one
of
these
immigration
cases.
remember--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it.
we
disagree
for
reasons
i'll
explain.
i
will
note
in
our
favor
that
the
attorney
general
doesn't
even
defend
that
position
anymore.
remember
that
they
do
not
argue
that
you
can
just
look
at
the
conviction.
they
want
to
have
the
fact-bound
inquiry
into
every
one
of
these
cases.
and
the
reason
is
that
if
you
apply
the
categorical
approach
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
they
want
to
do
it
in
every
single
case
at
the
beginning.
so
i
can
just
make
clear
everybody's
position.
there
really--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--sorry.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
in
every
case
at
the
beginning.
so
i'll--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
in
the
middle
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
immigration
proceedings.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
so
let
me--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--so
let
me
explain.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
so
our
position
is
it
is
a
controlled
substances
offense,
and
you
take
account
of
the
seriousness
of
the
offense
in
cancellation.
their
position
is
that
it
is
presumptively,
but
only
presumptively,
an
aggravated
felony.
and
in
every
single
immigration
proceeding,
when
you
have
a
case
like
this
the
noncitizen
can
come
forward
with
fact-found
evidence,
not
limited
to
the
record
of
conviction--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
let
me
just
say
first,
i
do
want
to
make
--
just
want
to
focus
on
what
the
parties'
positions
are.
and
they
do
have
this
fact-found
inquiry
in
every
one,
so
i
do
want
to
turn
to
what
i
think
is
probably
their
second
best
argument.
i
was
talking
about
the
underinclusiveness
as
the
first
one.
their
second
one
is
they
want
to
draw
an
analogy
between
this
and
what
would
happen
in
a
criminal
case.
so
they
say,
take
the
conviction
and
imagine
that
the
conviction
is
all
the
facts
that
you
had
in
a
federal
criminal
prosecution,
and
then
you
would
have
a
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
that
he
was
subject
to
the
misdemeanor.
we
have
several
points
about
that.
the
first
is
this
is
not
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
the
federal
statute
involved
is
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act,
and
it
tells
you
that
you
are
supposed
to
look
at
the
conviction
itself
and
determine
whether
it
corresponds
to
a
federal
felony.
this
further
proceeding
doesn't
exist,
and
it's
exactly
the
argument
that
was
rejected
in
carachuri-rosendo.
and
let
me
talk
about
why--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
we
disagree.
what
the
court
said
in
--
i
agree
with
the
beginning
of
how
you
characterize
the
carachuri
case.
what
the
court
said
is
we
don't
go
beyond
the
--
the
conviction
itself.
and
it's
true
that
in
that
case
the
government
wanted
to
go
beyond
the
record
to
go
up.
but
here
what
they're
saying
is
that
you
should
go
beyond
the
record
to
figure
out
if
you
should
go
down.
and
what
the
court
said
is,
no,
you
look
at
the
conviction
itself.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
it
is
what
you
are
convicted
of.
so
here,
he
was
convicted
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
the
other
side's
argument
is,
well,
if
i
had
just
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
that
would
be
a
federal
felony.
so
we
acknowledge
the
strength
of
that
point.
but
our--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--as
i
was
--
i
mentioned
very
briefly
to
justice
sotomayor,
when
you
have
a
divisible
statute
like
this,
that
includes
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
sell,
possess,
all
of
those
things,
you
use
the
modified
categorical
approach
to
figure
out
which
one
applies.
and
so
we
know
he
was
convicted
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
and
that's
common
ground
between
the
parties.
it's
not
the
whole
statute.
it's
just
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
hope
we
will.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
two
reasons.
first,
they
don't
have
a
real
solution.
and,
second,
congress
solved
our
problem.
and
this
is
what
carachuri-rosendo
says,
and
that
is,
when
you
have
an
underinclusiveness
problem
just
like
ours,
the
statute
fixes
it
because
the
statute
treats
the
conviction
as
a
controlled
substances
offense.
the
statute
provides
the
backstop.
you
don't
have
to
make
one
up,
which,
i
suggest
to
you,
is
the
difficulty
with
their
position.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
agree
with--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--that
is
our
problem.
i
agree
with
that
problem.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
okay.
that's
the
part
we
disagree
with,
justice
ginsburg.
maybe
i
can
just
read
to
you
what
this
court
said
about
this
exact
issue
in
carachuri-rosendo.
it
said
that
when
you
have
this
very
underinclusiveness
problem,
it
is
solved
by
the
statute,
because
the
attorney
--
all
that
happens
under
our
rule
--
it's
still
a
deportable
offense
and
the
attorney
general
denies
cancellation
of
removal.
so
if
could
just
read
very
briefly,
and
this
is
from
the
supreme
court
reporter
at
page
2589:
"we
note
that
whether
a
noncitizen
has
committed
an
aggravated
felony
is
relevant,
inter
alia,
to
the
type
of
relief
he
may
obtain
from
a
removal
order,
but
not
to
whether
he
is
in
fact
removable.
"
"in
other
words,
to
the
extent
that
our
rejection
of
the
government's
broad
understanding
of
the
scope
of
aggravated
felony
may
have
any
practical
effect
on
policing
our
nation's
borders,
it
is
a
limited
one.
"
"carachuri-rosendo
and
others
in
his
position
may
now
seek
cancellation
of
removal
and
thereby
avoid
the
harsh
consequence
of
mandatory
removal,
but
he
will
not
avoid
the
fact
that
his
conviction
makes
him--
"
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no,
justice
ginsburg,
it
does
not.
i
promise
you
it
does
not.
the
upshot
of
our
position
is
that
mr.
moncrieffe
has
committed
a
controlled
substances
offense,
and
anyone
else
in
his
position
has
committed
one.
and
if
there
is
a
serious
drug
amount,
the
attorney
general
will
deny
him
cancellation
of
removal.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
we
--
it's
an
interesting
question
that
i
have
puzzled
about
at
length.
i
think
the
answer
is
no
for
a
very
particular
reason,
however,
and
that
is
the
attorney
general
has
no
such
categorical
rules.
we
think
it's
a
point
in
our
favor
that
the
attorney
general,
in
the
application
starting
with
212(c)
before
the
1996
act,
which
is
discussed
in
this
court's
decision
in
st.
cyr,
through
the
present
has
instead
applied
a
holistic
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances.
what
he
certainly
can
do
is
direct
the
immigration
judges
to
place
special
weight
--
and
this
was
the
rule
before
1996,
by
the
way.
if
you
had
a
serious
offense,
you
had
to
show
special
equities
that
would
justify
your
not
being
removed
from
the
country.
and
so
we
think
that's
the
most
likely
outcome.
a
per
se
categorical
rule
would
be
very
unlike
what
we
understand
the
attorney
general
to
do
in
any
other
circumstance.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
i
think--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--well,
we
think
we
would
win,
so
i
wouldn't
be
back
for
this
client.
but
i
think
there
would
be
a
substantial
argument
that
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious,
because
it
would
be
so
unlike
anything
the
attorney
general
does
in
other
circumstances.
but
they
would
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
to
treat
all
of
these
cases
as
barring
cancellation
of
removal.
to
get
us
on
the
back
end,
as
it
were,
and
that
is--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
and
i
think
our
argument
that
it's
arbitrary
would
be
supported
by
the
fact
that
this
court
would
have
ruled
that
he
couldn't
do
the
identical
thing
on
the
front
end.
but
it's
an
open
question,
and
it's
not
presented
here.
i
had
said
that
there
were
two
flaws
in
the
--
sort
of
their
characterization
of
the
over
and
underinclusiveness
problem.
the
second
one
is
they
don't
have
a
real
solution.
this
is
a
big
problem.
under
these
state
convictions
in
which
the
amount
of
drugs
and
whether
there
was
remuneration
are
irrelevant,
it's
going
to
be
extremely
difficult
for
uncounseled
noncitizens
who
are
in
jail,
who
don't
have
access
to
tools
of
communication,
to
prove
to
an
immigration
judge
this
fact-found
inquiry
which
they
are
inserting
into
every
single
case,
that
their
offense
actually
corresponds
to
a
misdemeanor.
so
while
you
say
that
they
have
provided
the
solution,
i
don't
know
where
it
comes
from
in
the
statute,
but
we
think
it
is
not
a
practical
solution.
and
that
problem
is
even
worse
in
the
many
contexts
that
are
not
just
straight
removal.
we
said
in
our
opening
brief,
and
the
government's
response
ignores,
that
there
are
many
cases
in
which
immigration
officials
have
to
make
these
decisions
about
whether
it's
an
aggravated
felony
much
more
on
the
fly,
without
the
opportunity
to
call
everybody
in
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--we
don't.
we
tried.
i'm
sorry,
we
were
unable
to
do
it.
the
department
of
justice
has
better
relationships
with
prosecutors,
and
so
maybe
it
will
have
that
information
for
you.
but
i
can
say
that
the
--
it
is
absolutely
commonplace,
from
looking
at
the
case
law,
for
the
states
to
tackle
this
small
social
sharing
of
a
couple
of
marijuana
cigarettes.
this
is
--
that's
the
distinction
between
93
prosecutions
under
--
or
convictions
under
(b)(4)
and
possession
in
the
federal
system
and
750,000
in
the
states.
federal
prosecutors
leave
these
to
the
states.
which
brings
me
back
to
my
other
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
pointing
out
the
government's
argument
about
a
parallel
between
this
and
a
federal
criminal
prosecution.
and
the
reason
they
want
to
do
that,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
in
a
federal
--
actual
federal
criminal
prosecution,
the
burden
of
proof
never
matters,
including
because
federal
prosecutors
almost
never
bring
these
cases.
so
here's
what
we
tried
to
do.
this
statute,
(b)(4),
was
enacted
in
1970,
some
42
years
ago.
we
tried
to
identify
one
case
in
42
years
in
which
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
federal
case
made
any
difference
at
all,
and
we
were
unable
to.
and
i
would
be
really
interested
to
know
if
my
friend
is
able
to
identify
one
case
in
42
years
which
it
actually
made
a
difference.
and
the
reason
is,
in
an
actual
federal
prosecution,
the
fbi
agent
would
come
in
and
say,
here
are
the
drugs,
and
they
were
trying
to
sell
it
to
an
undercover
officer.
it's
never
the
case
that
it
actually
--
the
defendant
is
in
a
position
of
trying
to
prove
that
it
was
a
misdemeanor.
but
what
they
are
trying
to
do
is
to
take
that
rule
which
is
derived
from
apprendi,
that
there
is
a
burden
of
proof
so
that
the
government
doesn't
have
to
indict
that
it
wasn't
a
(b)(4)
offense,
and
take
the
silence
of
the
state
record,
where
these
facts
are
completely
irrelevant,
the
quantity
and
remuneration,
and
transpose
them
into
the
federal
system
and
take
great
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
record
is
silent.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yes.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
sure.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
yeah.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
there
are
about
15
of
those
states,
and
in
those
states,
if
you
weren't
convicted
under
the
small
one,
then
you
would
infer
it
wasn't
a
small
amount
and
no
remuneration,
and
the
person
would
have
committed
an
aggravated
felony.
our
issue
arises
only
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
state
is
prosecuting
people
under
the
statute
that
would
be
a
federal
misdemeanor.
if
the
state--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--no.
if
the
state
has
a
different
system,
as
a
material
number
of
states
do,
in
which
they
track
the
federal
system,
and
they
have
a
small
provision
or
a
remuneration
provision,
which
another
nine
states
have
a
remuneration
provision,
in
those
situations,
if
you
have
a
conviction
that
isn't
under
that
social
sharing
provision,
it's
an
aggravated
felony.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
i
have
one
really
good
example
of
a
prosecution
for
a
small
amount.
it's
this
case.
and
we
don't
deny
that
there
are
--
mr.
chief
justice,
please
do
not
misunderstand
me
to
be
arguing
that
every
georgia
conviction
or
that
80
or
90
percent
of
them
are
the
small
ones.
what
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
is
that
a
lot
of
them
are
just
like
this
one,
and
i
think
the
data
bears
that
out.
and
the
question
before
you
is,
under
a
categorical
approach,
is
it
fair
to
presume
that
they're
all
felonies?
is
it
fair
to
presume
that
what
congress
recognized
here
is
that
there
would
be
a
correspondence
between
a
conviction
under
this
statute
and
the
federal
aggravated
felony
of
illicit
trafficking
in
drugs,
to
strip
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
of
any
opportunity
whatsoever
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
case?
we
think
that
is
not
the
best
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
told
you
i
was
going
to
acknowledge
the
strengths
of
the
other
side's
case,
and
i
want
to
just
recognize
that
you
can
conceivably
read
the
statute
their
way.
but
the
question
is
if
you
actually
adopt
their
statutory
construction
argument
and
you
say
we're
going
to
look
at
the
elements
and
it's
an
aggravated
felony,
we're
comparing
two
different
ways
of
reading
it.
and
they
admit
that
their
way
of
reading
the
statute
comes
up
with
an
answer
that
congress
couldn't
possibly
have
intended
by
treating
all
these
misdemeanants
as
aggravated
felons.
now,
their
solution
is
to
add
a
whole
'nother
proceeding
that
isn't
in
the
statute.
another
solution
is
just
to
recognize
their
reading
is
wrong.
if
it
produces
this
ridiculous
result
that
congress
couldn't
have
intended
and
our
reading
is
perfectly
sensible
and
not
only
do
you
have
the
solution
of
the
removal
proceedings,
but
also
justice
kennedy's
suggestion
of
the
attorney
general's
ability
to
issue
an
order;
justice
sotomayor's
solution
of
being
able
to
look
at
the
plea
allocution,
questions
that
aren't
presented
here,
but
lots
of
ways
of
addressing
any
adverse
consequences
of
our
rule.
what
in
statutory
construction
allows
us
just
to
add
this
procedure
that--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
well,
“
punishable
”
is
a
good
word--
mr.
thomas
c.
goldstein
--okay.
but
i
don't
think
that's
actually
what
they're
doing
because
mr.
shah
did
not
deny
justice
kagan's
questions
about
yeah,
it
would
produce
this
ridiculous
result
and
so
we're
going
to
add
this
other
proceeding.
when
they
say
--
what
they
do
with
punishable
is
they
say
look
at
only
the
elements
of
the
federal
offense.
and
that's
how
they
say
that
any
georgia
conviction,
even
though,
justice
ginsburg,
lots
of
these
convictions
will
just
be
equivalents
to
federal
misdemeanors,
because
they
are
the
equivalent
of
--
because
they
involve
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
those
are
the
only
elements
of
the
offense,
then
they're
all
punishable
as
felonies
even
if
they
would
be
a
misdemeanor.
so
i
don't
think
punishable
helps
them,
and
they
don't
seem
to
argue
on
the
basis
of
punishable.
so
my
base
point
to
you
is
that
why,
in
choosing
between
these
two
readings,
we
have
strengths,
they
have
strengths.
their
argument
starts
from
the
proposition
that
theirs
produces
a
result
that
congress
couldn't
have
intended.
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
start
out
with
the
hardcore
position.
i
can
give
you
the
example.
it's
our
case.
remember,
even
though
this
is
1.3
grams,
even
though
he
was
not
convicted
of
selling,
they
ordered
him
mandatorily
deportable
without
an
inquiry
into
the
underlying
facts.
they
recognize
that
can't
be
right.
and
so
they
are
trying
to
tack
something
on
to
the
statute
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute.
the
last
point
that
i
want
to
address
is
actually
a
very
small
one,
and
that's
about
justice
thomas's
dissent
in
the
lopez
case
on
whether
you
should
look
to
the
state
definition
of
whether
this
is
a
felony
or
instead,
the
federal
one,
because
the
government
cites
it
in
a
footnote
in
their
brief.
and
we
would
only
say
that
the
government
is
not
relying
on
the
lopez
dissent.
it
invokes
lopez
repeatedly
in
the
federal
courts.
and
so,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
court's
decision
in
lopez
should
take
hold
as
a
matter
of
statutory
--
stare
decisis,
and
what
matters
here
is
the
federal
treatment
of
it.
when
you
don't
know
if
the
georgia
conviction
is
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor
under
federal
law,
you
don't
know
which
one
it
is,
what
the
categorical
rule
says
is
that
the
state
conviction
doesn't
necessarily
establish
it's
a
federal
offense,
the
federal
felony
here,
and
therefore,
you
don't
treat
it
that
way.
the
arguments
that
my
friend
ended
with,
ended
with
about
hey,
this
is
going
to
be
applied
in
federal
sentencing
and
lots
of
other
contexts
makes
it
worse,
not
better.
how
in
the
world
are
we
going
to
have
these
others
castro
rodriguez
proceedings,
these
other
intermediate
proceedings
about
determining
the
facts
of
the
offense
in
federal
sentencing?
it
gets
vastly
more
complicated.
our
rule
addresses
the
core
concern
of
congress.
it
gets
the
right
people
deported.
their
rule,
because
it's
overinclusive,
there
will
be
noncitizens
who
can't
prove
their
offense
was
a
misdemeanor
and
they
shouldn't
be
removed.
thank
you.
