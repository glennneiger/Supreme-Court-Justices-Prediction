justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
you
use
that
word,
regularly.
do
you
have
statistics
on
that?
were
they
provided
in
the
briefs?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
--
we
are
discussing
the
categorical
approach,
but
let's
assume
he
had
pled
guilty,
and
in
his
allocution,
he
had
admitted
to
not
a
smaller
amount
or
to
remuneration.
would
--
would
an
immigration
judge,
under
the
argument
you're
making
today,
have
to
ignore
that
allocution,
or
would
he
be
able
to
apply
the
modified
approach
and
find
this
gentleman
an
aggravated
felon?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
issue
with
this
case.
none
of
these
immigrants
are
being
let
out
automatically.
they
are
still
felons
subject
to
removal.
the
only
issue
is
whether--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well
--
they're--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--they're
still
subject
to
removal--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--either
way.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
goldstein,
there
are
at
least
93
cases,
all
right.
so--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
i
don't
know
and
i'm
not
going
to
ask
you
to
prove
to
me
how
the
burden
of
proof
was
met
or
not
met
in
those.
but
let
me
give
you
a
different
hypothetical.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
georgia
has
the
federal
statute,
but,
differently
than
the
federal
statute,
it
has
a
sale-distribution
provision,
and
it
has
a
small
amount,
no
remuneration
statute.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
would
happen
in
those
states?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what's
the
free
pass?
the
free
pass
is
mandatory
as
opposed
to
discretionary
deportation,
correct?
so
the
free
pass
is
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
those
convicted
individuals
would
still
be
subject
to
deportation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
nothing
would
stop
the
ins
judge
from
considering
the
amount
of
drugs,
correct,
that
the
individual
actually
was
involved
in,
and
that
could
be
introduced
through
hearsay,
through
almost
any
document,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
do
you
suggest
that
the
immigration
judges
don't
know
that,
and
that
they
wouldn't
weigh
that
desire
heavily
in
a
case
in
which
a
--
the
convicted
individual
is
proven
to
have
sold
the
larger
amount?
you
still
think
they
are
going
to
cancel?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
each
time
you
get
--
you
say
that,
you
get
back
into
the
hole
that
justice
kagan
has
been
asking
you
to
climb
out
of.
if
--
if
congress's
intent
was
to
bar
discretion,
then
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
you
get
to
your
alternative
to
get
out
of
your--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--overinclusiveness
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
counselor.
i
--
the
government
can
do
it
very
easily.
if
you
have
less
than
an
ounce
of
marijuana
and
nothing
else
from
which
you
can
infer
an
intent
to
sell
or
distribute,
and
you
have
no
proof
that
this
individual's
engaged
in
drug
trafficking,
what
more
does
a
defendant
have
to
show?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
does
it
raise
his
burden
of
proof?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
i
guess
my
point
is
that
one,
which
is
don't
the
facts
that
the
government
have
either
show
it
or
not
show
it
in
virtually
every
instance?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
would
be
less
than
an
ounce.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
go
back
to
your
substantive
argument?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
this
is
a
--
you
are
right;
it's
an
unusually
crafted
statute,
and
really
what
the
issue
is,
generally
what
you
have
with
lesser
included
offenses
is
you
have
a
base
offense
and
then
an
enhancement
that
goes
up.
you
commit
the
base
offense--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--of
burglary,
but
if
you
did
it
with
an
explosive
or
you
did
it
with
a
dangerous
weapon,
it
goes
up.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
applying
the
categorical
approach
is
relatively
easy
there
because
either
the
state
offense
includes
the
addition
or
it
doesn't.
this
is
sort
of
in
reverse.
you've
got
a
statute
with
the
same
elements
that
can
be
either
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony,
and
you're
saying
it
can
be
either
under
the
csa,
but
we
have
to
assume
it's
the
greater.
because--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--of
apprendi,
because
of
--
of--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
that's
under
apprendi.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
a--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--didn't
we
--
didn't
we
talk
about
the
categorical
approach
in
footnote
3
of
our
case
in
carachuri?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
where
we
said
that
in
talking
about
the
generic
federal
offense,
whether
it's
a
felony
or
not,
that
we
can't
look
at
just
strictly
the
elements
of
the
crime,
but
we
have
to
also
look
at
the
sentencing
factors,
because
when
we're
talking
about
what
constitutes
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony
under
federal
law
we
have
to
look
at
both.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
same
elements
would
go
to
the
misdemeanor.
really
the
issue
for
me
is
it
could
be
one
or
both
and
when
do
we
tell
the
immigration
judge
that
he
can,
should,
or
should
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--choose
between
the
two?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
however
you
do
it,
the
misdemeanor
still
has
the
same
three
elements.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
we
choose
between
it
being
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
under
the
--
under
the
--
do
you
have
the
same
answer
as
mr.
goldstein,
that
the
modified
categorical
approach
wouldn't
permit
the
immigration
judge
to
look
at
the
plea
allocution
to
determine
the
amount?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
that
in
--
in
many
of
these
cases
that
we're
talking
about,
it
is
possible
that
the
plea
allocution
itself
would
set
out
the
amounts
that
the
alien
sold
or
show
that
he
sold
something--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
that
would
take
care
of
this
issue
of
how
many
people
are
escaping
automatic
removal.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
the
vast
majority
--
the
vast
majority
in
my
experience
do
--
do
say
whether
the
crime
was
for
sale
or
distribution.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
case
concerns
the
immigration
consequences
of
a
conviction
for
a
marijuana
distribution
offense.
petitioner
adrian
moncrieffe
is
a
jamaican
citizen
who
came
to
the
united
states
legally
at
age
three.
over
20
years
later,
during
a
traffic
stop,
police
found
about
two
or
three
cigarettes'
worth
of
marijuana
in
his
car.
the
state
of
georgia
charged
him
with
possession
of
marijuana
with
intent
to
distribute.
he
plead
guilty
under
a
georgia
program
for
first-time
drug
offenders
which
allowed
him
to
avoid
prison
time.
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
however,
a
non-citizen
who
is
convicted
of
almost
any
drug
offense
may
be
deported.
and
so
the
federal
government
sought
to
deport
moncrieffe
because
of
his
conviction.
ordinarily,
a
non-citizen
may
ask
the
attorney
general
for
discretionary
relief
for
removal.
but
if
a
non-citizen
has
been
convicted
of
a
subset
of
drug
offenses
called
“illicit
drug
trafficking
offenses,”
then
the
attorney
general
is
prohibited
from
granting
discretionary
relief
no
matter
how
compelling
the
non-citizen's
case
is.
that
is
because
illicit
drug
trafficking
is
considered
an
aggravated
felony
under
the
immigration
laws,
and
aggravated
felonies
carry
a
specially
harsh
consequences.
an
illicit
drug
trafficking
offense
is
defined
as
any
felony
punishable
under
the
federal
drug
laws.
so
the
question
before
us
is
whether
moncrieffe's
georgia
conviction
for
possession
of
marijuana
with
intent
to
distribute
is
equivalent
to
a
felony
under
the
felony
drug
laws.
if
it
is
equivalent,
then
moncrieffe
is
subject
to
mandatory
deportation
as
an
aggravated
felon.
if
it
is
not
equivalent,
then
moncrieffe
is
still
deportable
as
a
drug
offender,
but
he
may
ask
the
attorney
general
for
discretionary
relief.
our
cases
have
held
that
we
determine
whether
a
state
offense
is
equivalent
to
a
federal
offense
by
using
an
analysis
called
“the
categorical
approach.”
this
is
a
somewhat
complicated
doctrine.
the
essence
of
it
is
that
we
do
not
examine
the
facts
underlying
the
non-citizen's
particular
conviction
to
determine
whether
those
facts
could
have
given
rise
to
a
federal
conviction.
instead,
we
consider
whether
any
conviction
of
the
state
crime
would
necessarily
establish
the
requirements
of
the
possibly
equivalent
federal
offense.
if
you
think
this
is
difficult,
so
does
everybody
else.
if
so,
then
we
say
that
the
state
offense
categorically
matches
the
federal
offense.
this
is
an
approached
that
has
long
been
used
in
our
immigration
law.
it
promotes
fairness
by
ensuring
that
all
non-citizens
who
are
convicted
under
the
same
statute
are
treated
the
same
and
it
avoids
the
need
to
re-examine
the
underlying
facts
of
old
state
convictions
years
later
in
immigration
court.
for
moncrieffe's
georgia
conviction
to
count
as
an
aggravated
felony,
it
would
need
to
categorically
match
a
federal
drug
offense
that
is
punishable
as
a
felony.
there
is
no
question
that
possession
of
marijuana
would
intent
to
distribute
is
a
federal
drug
offense,
but
whether
it
is
punishable
as
a
felony
under
federal
law
depends
upon
the
amount
of
marijuana
and
whether
there
was
remuneration.
the
mere
social
sharing
of
a
small
amount
of
marijuana
is
generally
a
misdemeanor
under
federal
law,
but
if
the
offense
involves
a
sale
or
a
larger
amount
of
marijuana,
it
is
a
felony.
here,
the
georgia
statute
says
nothing
about
remuneration
--
boy,
that
word
gets
me
--
or
the
quantity
of
marijuana.
it
punishes
all
instances
of
possessing
marijuana
with
the
intent
to
distribute.
including
those
had
involved
just
a
small
share
--
social
sharing
of
a
small
amount
of
marijuana.
the
georgia
statute
is
thus
broader
than
the
federal
aggravated
felony
because
it
comprises
both
marijuana
distribution
offenses
that
are
punishable
as
felonies
and
those
that
are
punishable
as
misdemeanors.
as
a
result,
a
conviction
under
the
georgia
statute
does
not
categorically
fit
within
the
federal
definition.
and
so,
moncrieffe's
conviction
is
not
an
aggravated
felony.
the
government
has
argued
that
the
misdemeanor
provision
for
sharing
a
small
amount
of
marijuana
should
not
be
relevant
under
the
categorical
approach
because
in
a
federal
drug
prosecution,
it
would
be
a
mere
sentencing
exception.
instead,
the
government
suggests
that
convictions
like
moncrieffe's
should
be
presumed
to
be
an
aggravated
felony,
but
that
non-citizen
should
then
be
allowed
to
show
in
immigration
court
that
their
convictions
involved
only
a
small
amount
of
marijuana
pursuit
for
no
money.
for
reasons
set
forth
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
reject
that
position
because
it
is
unsupported
by
the
text
of
the
immigration
law
and
inconsistent
with
our
established
categorical
approach.
again,
our
inquiry
must
focus
on
what
a
non-citizen's
conviction
standing
alone
established,
not
what
acts
he
committed
on
a
particular
occasion.
and
moncrieffe's
conviction
does
not
establish
an
offense
that
necessarily
qualifies
for
felony
treatment
under
federal
law.
the
government
also
fears
that
this
approach
will
allow
those
who
actually
committed
to
serious
drug
trafficking
offenses
to
avoid
being
labeled
as
aggravated
felonies.
but
remember
that
escaping
aggravated
felony
treatment
only
means
escaping
mandatory
deportation,
not
deportation
altogether.
a
serious
drug
trafficker
whose
state
conviction
is
not
categorically
an
aggravated
felony
may
apply
to
the
attorney
general
for
relief,
but
the
attorney
general
may
deny
that
relief
in
his
discretion
because
of
its
non-citizen's
serious
--
more
serious
conduct.
so
the
effect
of
this
decision
on
a
government's
ability
to
police
our
boarders
is
limited.
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
--
fifth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded.
justices
thomas
and
alito
have
each
filed
dissenting
opinions.
