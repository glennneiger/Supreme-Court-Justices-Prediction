chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-702,
moncrieffe
v.
holder.
mr.
goldstein.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
question's
not
before
us
today.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
well,
isn't
the
reason
we
don't
look
at
the
particular
facts
and
particular
case,
and
don't
depose
four
district
attorneys,
is
that
the
court
has
adopted
a
categorical
approach
precisely
to
avoid
that
type
of
inquiry
in,
whatever
it
is,
750,000
cases?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
no,
i'm
sorry.
we
don't
need
that
because
we've
adopted
a
categorical
approach.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
841(b)(1)(d)
lists
the
elements,
and
conviction
in
--
georgia,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--conviction
in
georgia
under
their
provision
satisfies
--
has
each
of
those
elements.
and
under
our
categorical
approach,
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
want
to
do
that
at
the
tail
end,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
before
you
get
on
--
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
their
position
at
all.
i
suppose
we
--
i
certainly
will
ask
them
because
they're
probably
better
able
to
articulate
their
position,
but--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
could
you
remind
me
what
the
“
it
”
is
that
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
an
order
from
the
attorney
general--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
the
immigration
judges--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
use
of
the
statistics,
i
think,
assumes
that
georgia
and
other
states
are
prosecuting
every
case
that
comes
before
them,
because
that's
how
you
get,
you
know,
at
least
750,000
nationwide,
so
much
more
than
must
involve
tiny
amounts.
but,
of
course,
perhaps
they
don't
prosecute
the
cases
involving
tiny
amounts,
so
that
most
of
those
cases,
or
some
percentage
of
them,
may,
in
fact,
also
involve
the
serious
type
of
conduct
addressed
by
the
federal
statute.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shah.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
will
you
pause
right
there.
i
don't
--
you
just
made
the
argument
that
your
position
on
castro-rodriguez
is
wrong.
you
say
congress
took
away
the
attorney
general's
discretion.
then
you
come
back
and
say,
well,
we're
going
to
exercise
that
discretion
under
castro-rodriguez,
and
this
petitioner
in
particular
can
take
advantage
of
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
--
is
the
authority
for
that
castro-rodriguez?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
authority
for
that
the
decision
in
castro-rodriguez?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
this
is
--
this
is
a
new
position
for
the
government.
my
understanding
is
that
you
--
your
clients
were
on
the
other
side
of
this
position
in
castro-rodriguez
itself;
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
that
was
a
change
in
the
government's
position,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
what
does
--
in
a
case
in
which
the
attorney
general
can
cancel
removal,
putting
aside
this
case,
what
are
the
sort
of
things
he
looks
at
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
cancel
removal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
one
of
the
things
presumably
is
the
amount
of
drugs
involved,
whether
they
were
for
intent
to
distribute
for
remuneration
--
all
the
sorts
of
things
that
you
say
he
can
consider
under
the
provision
that
says
he
does
not
have
the
authority
to
cancel
removal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
the
whole
point
--
the
whole
point
is
that
there
is
no
similar
provision
in
the
statute
at
issue
in
this
case,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
does
that
--
does
the
castro-rodriguez
proceeding
take
care
of
those
additional
consequences?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
goldstein,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-702,
moncrieffe
versus
holder.
