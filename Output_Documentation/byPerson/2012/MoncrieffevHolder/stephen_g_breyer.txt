justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that.
there's
something
i
really
don't
understand
in
these
cases,
because
the
other
cases,
our
precedent's
been
around
a
long
time,
so
i
would
have
guessed
that
under
that
precedent
in
these
other
statutes,
the
obvious
thing
to
do,
the
obvious
puzzle
here
is
not
the
federal
statute,
it's
the
state
statute,
what
is
this
thing
he
was
convicted
of
about.
so
you'd
pick
up
the
phone,
and
you'd
phone
at
random
four
u.s.
attorneys.
not
u.s.
attorneys,
but
four
state
attorneys--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
work
with
the
statute
in
georgia,
and
say,
now
look,
the
indictment
here
says
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
i
can
show
from
the
documents
that
it's
a
tiny
amount.
now,
is
it
your
policy,
if
he
was
selling
it,
to
charge
under
the
sell?
is
it
your
policy
if
he's
not
selling
it
to
charge
under
intent
to
distribute?
is
it
totally
random
whether
you
say
sell
or
intent
to
distribute?
what's
your
policy?
okay?
then
we
get
some
answers.
then
we'd
have
an
idea
whether
what
you're
saying
is
right.
now,
you
could
do
that,
but
they
could
do
it,
too.
anyone
could
do
it.
and
then
we'd
have
some
actual
facts
about
whether
this
charge
--
really,
it
corresponds
to
the
misdemeanor
or
the
felony
in
the
federal
statute.
so
why
--
i'm
not
--
i
mean,
that
isn't
a
brain
--
that
isn't
--
doesn't
require
--
it's
not
rocket
science,
okay?
so
why
has
no
one
done
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
say
never.
the
question
is
what
kind
of
a
statute
is
this
state
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
kind
of
statute
that
it
is,
is
a
statute
that
is
used
to
prosecute
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--with
small
amounts
when
they
don't
sell.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
your
version
of
what
that
felon
intends
to
distribute,
the
distinction
there
is
really
picked
up
by
the
district
attorneys.
and
if
it's
not,
then
they
may
be
right,
because
--
because
then
intent
to
distribute
may
well
often
include,
as
it
does
under
federal
law,
people
who
sell
stuff.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
you
didn't.
in
any
words,
nobody
did
it.
so
my
other
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--which
is
the
only
other
one
i
really
have,
aside
from
making
that
suggestion,
but
here,
what
happened
to
this
person?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
was
--
was
he
sentenced
under
16-13-2(a)?
that
is,
was
he
sentenced
to
probation,
which
would
be
evidence
in
your
favor,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
was
he
or
wasn't
he?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
he
was,
what
it
says
in
this
provision
is
that
the
court
may
without
entering
a
judgment
of
guilt.
so
there
was
no
judgment
of
guilt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
says,
if
he
completes
it,
he
then
is
discharged
without
court
adjudication
of
guilt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
shall
not
be
deemed
a
conviction,
it
says
for
purposes
of
this
code.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
are
we
saying
he
was
convicted
of
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
the
word
“
punishable
”,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
thinking
under
georgia
law
this
is
punishable
as
a
felony
only
if
it
wasn't
a
small
amount
used
for
personal
use,
you
see,
and
therefore,
they
go
into
the
hearing.
it's
not
punishable
as
an
841
felony,
unless
those
two
things
are
absent
and
therefore
they
have
the
hearing
to
find
out.
and
the
word
“
punishable
”
doesn't
appear
in
the
statutes,
the
other
ones
that
we've
construed.
that's
what
i
thought
they
were
doing.
