justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
now,
mr.
goldstein,
when
you
say
this
case,
is
there
any
proof
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
small
amount
and
no
remuneration?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goldstein,
it's
because
they
are
trying
to
mirror
the
federal
statute,
which
makes
the
small
amount
and
no
remuneration,
makes
that
like
an
affirmative
defense.
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
those
two
things
to
get
out
from
under
the
main
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
the
government
is
suggesting
is
as
close
to
the
federal
statute
as
you
can
get.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
carachuri.
that
case
involved,
in
order
to
hold
for
the
government,
you
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
of
the
state
conviction.
you'd
have
to
add
something
that
wasn't
in
the
state
conviction.
and
it's
the
same
thing
here.
to
get
to
where
you
want
to
go,
you
have
to
add
something
that
isn't
in
the
state
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--your
answer
because
i
think
you
have
to
concede
that
under
your
view
a
lot
of
people
who
are
convicted
under
the
georgia
statute
who
had
a
significant
quantity
which
they
intended
to
distribute--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
remuneration--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--many
of
those
people
would
--
under
your
view
of
the
statute,
many
of
those
people
would
not
have
committed
an
aggravated
felony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
have
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
large
underinclusiveness
problem
which
you
haven't
solved.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
that
follows
from
in
carachuri-rosendo
the
government
wanted
to
go
outside
the
record.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
agree
with
mr.
goldstein
when
he
says
in
reality
it's
not
an
affirmative
defense,
that
the
defendant
never
has
to
prove
the
amount?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
any
other
consequences?
we've
been
talking
only
about
dispensation
from
removal.
but
are
there
any
other
consequences
that
matter?
