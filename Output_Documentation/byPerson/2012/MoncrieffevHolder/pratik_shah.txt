mr.
pratik
a.
shah
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
proposed
rule
would
confer
a
free
pass
from
aggravated
felony
treatment
to
criminal
aliens
convicted
under
a
majority
of
state
laws
that
require
neither
remuneration
nor
more
than
a
small
amount.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
the
free
pass
is
that
you
would
never
have
an
aggravated
felony
for
this
conviction
under
any
state
that
did
not
make
an
element
of
the
state
offense
to
disprove
--
no
remuneration
or
more
than
a
small
amount.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor,
they
would
still
be
subject--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
you're
talking
about
the
discretionary
cancellation
of
removal
proceeding?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
it's
true,
your
honor,
that
could
come
in
there.
but
congress
specifically
enacted
this
aggravated
felony
provision
to
take
away
that
discretion
from
the
attorney
general.
the
motivating
factor
behind--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--what
--
your
honor,
what
congress
said
when
it
passed
this
very
provision
was
that
immigration
judges
were
granting
too
much
discretionary
relief
to
this
very
class
of
criminal
aliens,
and
that
is
why
it
implemented
this
aggravated
felony.
now,
petitioner
says
it's
not
going
to
have
a
big
deal
on
immigration
--
big
impact
on
immigration
policy
for
the
reason
that
you
suggest:
the
attorney
general
can
do
it
at
the
back
end.
but
that--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
it's
not
an
exercise
of
discretion
under
castro-rodriguez.
we
at
the
tail
end
have
an
inquiry
that
i
think
mirrors
the
csa
scheme.
remember
that
this
aggravated
felony
provision
in
the
ina
incorporates
by
reference
the
csa
scheme.
what
the
csa
scheme
provides
is,
as
a
default
matter,
any
conviction
for
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
marijuana
will
be
a
felony.
but
the
csa
scheme
also
provides
a
narrow
mitigating
exception
for
those
who
distribute
just
a
small
amount
socially.
what
our
scheme
does
is
that--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
to
have
that
secondary
proceeding?
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
i
think
it
comes
from
the
statute,
the
ina,
which
incorporates
the
csa
scheme.
because
many
of
the
state
provisions
don't
offer
that
same
affirmative
mitigating
exception
that
the
federal
scheme
does,
what
castro
rodriguez
does
is
it
looks
to
the
ina,
which
incorporates
the
csa,
and
then
provides
a
similar
mechanism
in
immigration
court.
but
it's
not
an
unprecedented
inquiry.
the
board
has
been
doing
similar
inquiries
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
century.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i
agree,
the
government
could
have
taken
the
hard-line
approach
that
it's
game
over
under
the
categorical
inquiry
because
the
elements--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
scheme.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
consistent.
and
here's
one
way
to
think
about
it.
this
--
this
particular
aggravated
felony
is
a
little
bit
complicated
because
it
incorporates
by
reference
in
two
different
levels
the
csa.
congress
--
let's
assume
congress
rewrote
the
aggravated
felony
definition
to
eliminate
the
incorporation
by
reference.
i
think
what
the
equivalent,
the
functionally
identical
formulation
would
be
--
the
definition
of
the
aggravated
felony
is,
"any
distribution
of
a
controlled
substance,
unless
the
defendant
shows
that
it
involved
a
small
amount
of
marijuana
for
no
remuneration.
"
that
would
incorporate
both
the
presumptive
felony
provision,
any
distribution
of
controlled
substance
--
you
have
the
same
two
elements
--
and
then
it
would
add
in
the
proviso
that
it's
in
the
csa
mitigating
exception.
functionally
identical.
aggravated
felony
is,
"any
distribution
of
a
controlled
substance,
unless
the
defendant
shows
that
it
was
a
small
quantity
for
remuneration.
"
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
what
our
inquiry
does
is--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--what
our
inquiry
does
is
allow
the
board
to
get
to
that
second
part
of
the
definition,
the
“
unless
”
clause,
and
that
mirrors
exactly
other
aggravated
felony
provisions
in
the
ina.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i'm
not
positing--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i'm
not
positing
a
new
statute.
i
was
simply
taking
out
the
incorporation
by
reference
so
we
could
look
at
it
in
a
different
way.
i
think
it's
functionally
identical
to
the
provision
at
issue
here.
and
i
think
it's--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
say
that
it
presumptively
creates
the
aggravated
felony,
and
it's
because
of
that--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
well--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
the
heading
to
the
brief
says
“
presumptively
”,
and
so
i
didn't
use
that
word
every
time,
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
it
would
be
the
--
the
aggravated
felony
has
that
“
unless
”
clause.
and
if
you
look
at
other
aggravated
felony
provisions
in
the
34
of
the
government's
brief,
it
defines
an
aggravated
felony
as
certain
document
fraud
crimes,
and
then
it
has
a
clause
that
says,
quote,
“
unless
”
--
"unless
the
alien
has
affirmatively
shown
that
the
alien
committed
the
offense
for
the
purpose
of
assisting,
abetting
or
abating
only
the
alien's
spouse,
child
or
parent
to
violate
a
provision
of
the
ina.
"
so
you
could
say
ball
game
over
once
you
have
shown
the
document
fraud
crime
under
the
categorical
approach.
but
the
ina
specifically
has
a
provision
that
says
unless
the
alien
can
show
that
he
committed
the
offense
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
and
abetting--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
we
categorically
deny
that
you
could
have
this
sort
of
proceeding,
and
in
the
op
to
this
case,
i
know
petitioner
says
this
is
a
new
position
in
this
case.
pages
13
through
16
of
our
op
embrace
castro-rodriguez
as
the
right
way
to
do
it.
i
think--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
i
can
say
that
the
--
the
government
did
dispute
the
particular
facts
in
castro-rodriquez.
i
can't
say
that
they
categorically
rejected
the
availability
of
that
sort
of
inquiry,
and
that
sort
of
inquiry
is
not
new.
if
you
look
at
the
grijalva
decision,
which
is
discussed
on
--
in
footnote
23
of
our
brief
on
page
36,
that
was
a
precursor
to
the
controlled
substance
ground
of
removability
that
is
currently
in
effect.
and
so
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
that
precursor
provision,
essentially
it
said
any
aliens
deportable
for
a
drug
offense,
unless
that
drug
offense
involves
simple
possession
of
marijuana
of
30
grams
or
less.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
it's
a
balance
of
equities.
after,
assuming
that
the
--
the
alien
has
established
the
three
eligibility
criteria
set
forth,
it
will
be
a
balance.
it's
a
favorable
exercise
of
discretion;
it's
a
balance
of
the
equities.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
those
are
the
sorts
of
factors
that
might
be
open
to
consideration,
but
what
congress
did
is
it
took
away
the
ability
for
the
attorney
general
to
exercise
that
discretion.
that
was
the
main
purpose
of
this
very
aggravated
felony
provision.
now
justice
sotomayor,
if
i
can
go
to
your--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
this
will
bar
discretion
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
and
here's
why.
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
data
question
that
you
asked,
justice
sotomayor,
we
do
have
federal
data,
and
i
interpret
the
data
a
little
bit
differently
than
my
colleague.
what
data
we
have
is
that
over
the
last
decade
there
have
been
over
60,000
convictions
under
--
under
section
841(a)
for
crimes
involving
something
more
than
possession
of
marijuana,
60,000.
there
have
been
in
those
10
years
exactly
20
that
have
been
sentenced
under
section
841(b)(4).
my
colleague
combines
844(a),
which
is
a
possession
offense,
but
if
you
isolate
out
of
the
data
only
those
who
qualify
for
the
mitigating
exception,
those
who
are
charged
with
distribution
of
marijuana
but
only
have
a
small
amount
of
remuneration,
you
have
20
out
of
over
60,000.
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
atypical
case.
to
the
extent
this
petitioner--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that,
because
if
it
were
in
fact
the
case
that
the
government
had
to
disprove
the
--
the
small
amount
and,
more
importantly,
the
remuneration
element,
that
would
be
a
very
different
statute.
every
court
of
appeals
and
lots
of
the
federal--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--oh,
i--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i'm
not
saying
it
--
the
defendant
has
to
show
more.
i
believe
justice
--
i
thought
justice
ginsburg's
question
is
what
would
the
government
have
to
show
to
disprove
it,
and
i
think--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
it's
a
very
different
question.
if
you
put
the
burden
on
the
government
to
show
that
in
fact
no
remuneration
was
involved,
the
government
would
have
to
meet
its
burden
in
a
criminal
case
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
was
no
remuneration
at
all.
that
is
going
to
change
the
result
in
a
large
number
of
cases
where
there
is
a
relative
--
it's
going
to
be
the
universe
of
cases
where
there
is
a
relatively
small
amount
of
drugs
involved.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
right.
but
in
--
and
in
that
universe
of
cases,
in
fact
the
presumption
is
probably
going
to
be
that
it's
not
for
a
distribution
or
remuneration.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
--
i
think
it's
because
of
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute.
apprendi
might
have
influenced
that
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
interpreted
this
statute
has
said
that
the
--
the
default
punishment
is
the
punishable
up
to
5
years.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
both
before
and
after
apprendi,
your
honor,
this
statute
was
interpreted
the
same
way.
apprendi
didn't
change
anything
because
there
were
no
sentencing
factors
or
elements--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--to
get
to
the
5-year--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--uh-huh.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
your
honor,
what
carachuri
involved
was
something
very
different.
it
involved
a
recidivism
factor,
an
aggravating
factor.
when
you
are
talking
about
an
aggravating
factor
apprendi
jurisprudence
has
treated
those
somewhat
equivalent
to
an
element,
because
it
raises
the
statutory
maximum.
and
so
when
you
are
trying
to
decide
whether
something
is
punishable
as
a
felony,
it's
natural
to
look
at
the
aggravating
factor.
the
other
thing
i
would
say
about
carachuri
is
that
it's
easily
distinguishable
on
the
grounds
that
justice
ginsburg
raised.
it
--
the
government's
argument
in
carachuri
was
much
more
difficult.
the
government
was
trying
to
rely
on
a
recidivism
factor
that
was
not
part
of
the
predicate
conviction,
and
it
was
trying
to
rely
on
that
factor
to
elevate
what
was
otherwise
a
misdemeanor
under
both
state
and
federal
law
to
a
felony.
here,
the
predicate
conviction
itself
has
all
the
elements
that
are
required
for
a
federal
felony
under
the
csa,
namely
possession
of
marijuana
and
a
specific
intent
to
distribute
it.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
i
think
there
are--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
there
are
--
i
think
there
are
two
ways,
your
honor,
that
--
two
different
lines
of
reasoning
that
show
that
the
government's
approach
to
the
categorical
part
of
the
inquiry
is
--
is
the
right
approach,
and
not
petitioner's
approach.
the
first
is--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
here's
--
here's
how--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--right.
i
think
here
are
the
two
ways
you
get
there.
first
is
by
looking
at
how
this
court
has
consistently
formulated
the
categorical
inquiry.
starting
with
taylor,
pre-apprendi
case,
compare
the
elements
of
the
predicate
offense
to
the
those
of
the
generic
offense.
fast
forward
past
apprendi
through
all
of
the
more
recent
cases,
lopez
and
not
--
still
the
same
inquiry,
focusing
on
the
elements
of
the
predicate
and
the
elements
of
the
generic.
if
that
is
not
enough
for
you,
justice
sotomayor,
if
there
is
still
some
uncertainty
as
to
when
you
have
mitigating
factors,
like
in
this
case,
and
the
question
is,
well,
does
the
predicate
conviction
have
to
affirmatively
negate
those
narrow
mitigating
criteria,
then
this
court
can
look,
if
it
wants
to
go
to
first
principles,
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
nijhawan.
there,
it
had
a
different
aggravating
felony,
certain
fraud
and
deceit
offenses
which
resulted
in
a
$10,000
loss
to
the
victim.
what
the
court
said,
look,
fraud
and
deceit,
those
are
clearly
elements,
we
are
going
to
apply
the
categorical
approach
to
figure
out
whether
those
elements
are
satisfied.
but
the
$10,000
loss
factor,
we're
not
sure.
we're
not
sure
whether
the
predicate
offense
has
to
affirmatively
establish
it
or
not.
and
so
what
the
court
did
is
it
did
a
survey
of
the
50
states.
it
looked
at
the
50
states.
and
it
turns
out
that
in
a
vast
majority
of
those
states,
the
predicate
conviction
will
never
establish
that
$10,000
loss
factor,
and
so
you're
going
to
have
a
vastly
underinclusive
aggravated
felony,
and
that's
something
that
congress
--
that
congress
could
not
have
intended.
the
court
said
congress
would
not
have
intended
its
aggravated
felony
provision
to
apply
in
such
a
limited
and
haphazard
manner.
i
submit
that's
exactly
what
you
have
here
on
pages
26
to
30
of
our
brief.
and
petitioner
does
not
take
issue
with
a
single
one
of
the
statutes
that
we
cite,
and
we
go
through
all
50
of
them.
we
show
that
in
a
clear
majority
of
the
states,
the
predicate
conviction
will
not
establish
that
there
is
remuneration
or
more
than
a
small
amount.
congress
cannot--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
first,
your
honor,
i
am
glad
that
we
have
an
agreement
on
the
first
part
of
the
categorical
inquiry,
because
i
think
that
is
the
main
part
of
the
inquiry
that
--
that
would
establish--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--okay.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
again,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
this
particular
aggravated
felony,
which
i
think
is
structured
similar
to
other
aggravated
felonies
in
the
ina.
if
you
look
at
the
aggravated
felony
in
the
ina
that's
on
page
--
top
of
page
34
of
our
brief,
and
that
is
the
one
about
document
fraud
crimes,
it
says
the
alien
--
then,
if
the
alien
then
shows
that
that
document
fraud
crime
was
perpetrated
in
order
to
help
a
family
member,
then
no
more
aggravated
felony.
how
does
the
alien
make
that
showing?
he
comes
into
immigration
court
--
after
it's
already
been
established
that
you
have
the
predicate
document
fraud
felony,
he
comes
into
immigration
court.
he
has
to
bring
forth
evidence
on
his
own
that
shows
that
it
satisfied
this
familial
exception
to
that
document
fraud
aggravated
felony.
i
think
the--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
the
point
is
that
there
is
a
similar
provision.
in
the
--
the
ina
here
incorporates
the
csa
to
define
the
aggravated
felony.
the
csa
says
it's
a
felony
if
you
have
possession
plus
intent
to
distribute,
unless
the
defendant
shows
--
and
this
is
how
it
has
been
interpreted
by
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
interpreted
the
csa
--
unless
the
defendant
shows
it
was
only
a
small
amount
for
no
remuneration.
that
is
an
identical
formulation
to
some
of
the
other
aggravated
felonies
in
the
provision,
and
how
those
other
aggravated
felony
provisions
have
been
interpreted
is
to
allow
the
alien
to
come
into
immigration
court
to
show
the
exception.
we
are
not
aware
of
a
single
court
decision
that
has
ever
interpreted
any
similar
provision
in
any
of
the
other
aggravated
felony
provision
to
require
the
predicate
conviction
to
affirmatively
negate
it.
and
that's
exactly
what
petitioner's
main
submission
is,
that
this
predicate
conviction
has
to
affirmatively
negate
the
possibility
of
a
narrow
mitigating
exception.
that
is--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--well,
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that
characterization
of
that
statute.
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
this
statute
has
rejected
the
argument
that
we
have
two
separate
offenses
and
that
the
--
that
the
government,
in
order
to
get
to
the
higher
offense,
the
default
felony
provision,
that
the
government
would
have
to
treat
as
elements
the
mitigating
criteria
of
remuneration
and
small
amount.
every
court
of
appeals
has
rejected
that.
if
this
statute
were
drawn
as
you
suggest,
and
it
were
elements
of
a
crime,
that
is,
you
had
two
separate
offenses,
one
is
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
a
small
amount
for
no
remuneration,
or
it
could
just
say
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
marijuana,
if
that
was
one
distinct
offense
that
was
a
misdemeanor,
and
then
congress
created
a
second
offense
that
says
in
cases
where
there
is
more
than
a
small
amount
and
which
there
is
remuneration,
then
you
get
a
five-year
maximum
instead
of
a
one-year
maximum,
that
is
effectively
making
as
an
element
the
government
to
disprove
both
the
possibility
of
no
remuneration
and
more
than
a
small
amount.
if
that
was
the
statutory
scheme
that
were
at
issue,
i
would
agree
with
you,
petitioner
would
prevail
under
the
categorical
approach.
that's
not
the
cat
--
that's
not
the
statutory
scheme
here.
they
do
not
disagree
with
that.
they
agree
that
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
interpreted
this
has
interpreted
it
as
one
offense,
and
that
those
mitigating
criteria
are
just
that,
they
are
mitigating
exceptions
and
not
offense
elements.
i
think
the
other
point
i
would
make,
your
honor,
is
that--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--two
things,
your
honor.
one
is
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
labeling
because
congress
knows
that
these
labels
actually
have
big
consequences.
if
you
made
those
mitigating
criteria
elements,
that
would
be
a
very
different
statute
which
the
government
in
every
case
would
have
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it's
more
--
more
than
a
small
quantity.
that
may
not
be
difficult;
but,
in
cases
where
there
is
a
small
quantity,
it
may,
in
fact,
be
difficult
to
disprove--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
this
statute
was
enacted
before
apprendi,
but
apprendi
doesn't
change
the
interpretation
of
this
statute.
this
statute
--
in
the
relevant
criteria.
this
statute
was
interpreted
--
interpreted
both
the
same
before
and
after
apprendi
with
respect
to
the
default
provision
because
the
default
provision
doesn't
require
any
factors
or
elements
at
all
to
get
to
the
felony
provision.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
well,
i
think
what
congress
had
in
mind
is
that
those
mitigating
criteria
would
not
be
treated
as
elements.
and,
justice
kagan,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
how
do
we
know.
well,
we
can
look
at
the
inquiry
that
the
court
did
in
nijhawan.
it
would
not
be
--
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
congressional
intent
to
assume
that
congress
intended
that
this
aggravated
felony
provision
would
not
have
any
effect
in
the
clear
majority
of
states
that
do
not
make
either
remuneration
or
more
than
a
small
quantity
an
element
of
the
offense.
that
is
what
nijhawan
was
about.
it
was
trying
to
figure
out,
did
congress
intend
this
particular
piece
of
the
aggravated
felony
description
to
be
subject
to
the
categorical
approach
or
not;
that
is,
did
it
require
the
predicate
conviction
to
establish
or
negate
it?
and
the
right
way
to
look
at
that
is
to
look
at
the
state
of
the
state
laws.
and
here
we
know
that
in
a
clear
majority
of
states,
they
do
not
require
remuneration,
they
do
not
require
more
than
a
small
amount,
you
will
never
get
an
aggravated
felony
conviction
out
of
a
majority
of
states.
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
result.
that's
what
nijhawan
stands
for.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
your
honor,
i
think
that's--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
that
--
i
think
that's
an
open
question.
that's
one
that
has
not
come
up
yet.
i
think
congress
specifically--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--it
may
--
it
may
be
--
be
an
option
open
to
the
attorney
general
to
do
that.
the
attorney
general
would
have
to
issue
an
order
to
that
ground.
i
imagine
it
would
be
challenged
and
we'd
have
to
litigate
it.
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
congress
didn't
want
those
sort
of
discretionary
determinations
made.
congress
knew
that
all
of
these
areas--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
the
modified
categorical
approach
would
allow
--
would
allow--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--i
think
if
the
plea
agreement
or
plea
colloquy
set
forth
the
amount
and
it
was
more
than
a
small
amount,
i
think
the
modified
--
our
position
would
be
that
the
modified
categorical
approach
would
allow
you
to
reach
that.
petitioner's
and
his
amici's
argument
are
essentially
that
the
plea
agreements
aren't
going
to
say
that
in
a
large
majority
of
these
cases
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
--
that
a
vast
majority
of
the
states
don't
make
more
than
a
small
quantity
an
element
of
the
crime
and
so
it's
going
to
be
irrelevant.
but
that
simply
shows--
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
--and
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
government
would
agree
that
if
we
were
to
lose
this
case,
we
could
then
look
at
--
look
at
that
evidence
to
--
to
show
--
to
disprove
more
than
a
small
amount,
something
that's
not
an
element
in
any
of
the
state
crimes.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
other
consequences
that
matter.
for
example,
a
person
who's
not
--
a
person
is
not
only
removable
and
not
only
deprived
of
cancellation
relief.
there
--
those
who
are
aggravated
felons
are
just
essentially
deprived
of
all
forms
of
discretionary
relief
except
for
convention
against
torture
relief
and
withholding
of
removal.
it
also
has
implications
beyond
the
immigration
context.
at
the
same
time
that
congress
enacted
this
aggravated
felony
provision,
it
made
it
a
sentencing
enhancement
provision
in
criminal
prosecutions
for
illegal
reentry.
and
so
in
any
illegal
reentry
prosecution,
if
the
defendant
is
also
--
has
a
prior
conviction
for
marijuana
distribution,
they
would
be
subject
to
a
significant
sentencing
enhancement
under
both
the
guidelines
and
section
1326,
the
illegal
reentry
statute.
if
petitioner's
rule
were
to
prevail
in
a
significant
number
of
those
cases
in
any
state
in
which
it
did
not
have
those
relevant
elements,
that
sentencing
enhancement
would
no
longer
have
operative
effect.
so,
your
honor,
it's
not
simply
the
case,
as
petitioner
would
like
to
say,
that
the
only
thing
here
is
--
is
a
difference
between
removability
and
cancellation
of
removal
relief
that
the
attorney
general
can
fix
on
his
own.
there
are
other
ancillary
consequences,
and
i
think
the
criminal
--
the
consequence
of
the
criminal
prosecution
is
a
significant
one.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
if
i
may
respond,
your
honor.
mr.
pratik
a.
shah
thank
you.
i
don't
--
i
think
what
--
we
haven't
had
any
criminal
cases
where
the
--
where
an
alien
has
come
in
and
tried
to
make
the
argument.
i
imagine
if
petitioner
prevails,
it
will
be
made
in
every
single
one
of
those
1326
reentry
prosecutions.
i
think
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
government's
submission
both
on
the
threshold
categorical
inquiry
and
on
the
tail-end
fact-specific
inquiry,
i
think
a
defendant
would
probably
be
able
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
to
make
that
showing
in
the
federal
sentencing
proceeding
as
well.
