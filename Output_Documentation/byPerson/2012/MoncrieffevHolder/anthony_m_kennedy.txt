it's
a
massive
amount
of
conduct
that
the
statute
contemplates?
the
statutory
scheme
--
i
just
didn't

again,
i
didn't

they
want
to
do
it
in
every--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--at
the
beginning
of
the
state
prosecution?
justice
anthony
m.

all
right.
justice
anthony
m.

would
it
be
permissible
--
i
had
the
same
question.
would
it
be
permissible--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
would
you
be
back
up
here
saying
that
this
violates
the
statute.

anthony
m.

do
you
have
any
statistics,
if
you
take
the
whole
universe
of
convictions
under
the
georgia
statute,
what
percentage
of
them
are
for
these
minor
offenses
and
what
are
for
the
major?
do
we
have
any
handle
on
that
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you've
answered
justice
kagan's
question
by
--
she
said,
doesn't
your
own
interpretation
of
this
statute
require
the
opposite
result
and
--
or
the
harsh
result?
and
you
say,
well,
suppose
congress
wrote
a
statute
this
way.
but
that
wasn't
her
question.
the
question
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
--
you
said
that
congress
could
write
a
new
statute.
of
course
congress
could
write
a
new
statute,
but
what
about
this
one.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
do
not
--
if
you
do
not
prevail
in
this
case,
can
you
simply
solve
this
problem
in
the
discretionary
removal
proceedings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
just
say
we're
going
to
--
we're
going
to
order
you
removed
unless
you
bring
in
evidence
that
this
was
a
minor
amount.
period.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
don't
you
think
it's
--
it's
under
the
law,
and
under
administrative
practice
that
it's
an
option
available
to
you?
