chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
first
in
case
12-17,
mcburney
v.
young.
mr.
gupta.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
--
all
he
has
to
do
is
get
somebody
from
--
from
virginia
to
ask
for
him,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
person
too
much,
he
just
has
to
write
a
letter
saying
give
me
these
documents,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
an
increased
cost
of
--
i
don't
know
how
much
--
100
bucks,
right?
go
--
write
a
letter,
say
you
want
these
documents,
and
when
they
come
to
your
house,
give
them
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
a
regulation
of
commerce.
it's
a
state
practice
that
may
have
an
incidental
effect
on
commerce,
and
the
incidental
effect
may
be
disproportionate,
depending
upon
whether
you're
state
or
local,
but
it's
not
a
regulation
of
commerce.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
if
the
state
of
virginia
says,
as
a
policy,
we
want
to
help
virginia
businesses
and
so
we're
going
to
open
a
business
training,
best
practices
institute
where
you're
going
to
learn
how
to
be
a
better
business
person,
but
the
only
people
who
can
come
in
are
--
are
virginia
businesses.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
your
theory,
because
that
will
have
an
effect,
an
incidental
effect
on
commerce
in
a
way
that's
discriminatory,
is
--
is
that
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
that
--
when
you're
talking
about
impact,
is
that
a
pike
analysis?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
if
it
was
facial
discrimination,
you're
not
concerned
about
impact.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
a
question
of
talking
about
the
effects
on
interstate
commerce,
that's
the,
you
know,
the
pike
analysis.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
--
is
this
your
privileges
and
immunities
argument
or
your
dormant
commerce
clause
argument?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
then
it's
not
enough
that
this
is
a
big
deal
to
your
client.
it
has
to
be
something
that
is
essential
to
hold
the
country
together
as
a
national
unit.
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
say
somebody
gathering
records
about
commercial
--
under
foia
fits
that
description.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
but
see,
they're
just
to
get
into
those.
again,
i
think
a
lot
of
those
examples
you
--
you
do
have
access
under
other
statutes.
you're
talking
about
mortgage
rules
and
all
that.
aren't
those
all--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
general
getchell?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
sotomayor,
the
only
reason
you
don't
let
out-of-staters
get
these
records
is
because
of
the
added
overhead
costs?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know.
but
--
but
--
so
why
don't
you
do
it
anyways?
just
as
i
asked
your
friend,
it
doesn't
seem
like
that
big
a
deal.
it
doesn't
seem
like
that
big
a
deal
for
you
either.
if
you
can
recoup
overhead
costs
from
people
who
request,
and
i'd
assume
you
would
be
able
to,
why
don't
other
people
--
people
from
west
virginia
may
have
interest
in
how
virginia
government
operates,
too.
and
--
and
again,
what
cost
is
there
to
you
other
than
overhead?
you
don't
want
to
keep
how
virginia
government
operates
quiet
from
outsiders
when
you
let
in
--
its
citizens
get
the
access,
do
you?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
under
the
privileges
--
privileges
and
immunities
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
okay.
but
what
about
the
dormant
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
i
know
--
i
understand
your
argument.
i'm
just
asking
you
why
bother?
i
mean,
what
--
what's
the
--
and
that's
certainly
pertinent
to
some
of
the
commerce
clause
analysis.
and
i
haven't
heard
anything
other
than
the
overhead
costs.
and
i
think
you
can
recoup
that
from
the
requesters.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you've
got
to
maintain
and
generate
the
database
anyway
for
virginia
citizens
who
are
going
to
ask
for
it.
this
is
not
an
added
cost.
other
than
--
it's
an
added
cost
if
you
have
to
hire
an
additional
person
to
handle
--
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
just
these
two
people.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
no
more
complicated
in
the
system
if
you
let
out-of-staters
have
access,
too.
you
say
we
want
a
simple
system.
it's
going
to
be
the
same
system
whether
you
win
or
lose.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
general.
mr.
gupta,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
