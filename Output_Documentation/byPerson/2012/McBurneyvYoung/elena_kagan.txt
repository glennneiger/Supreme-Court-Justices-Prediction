and
is
the
only
thing
that's
necessary
--
excuse
me
--
is
the
only
thing
that's
necessary
that
the
law
affect
a
few
people
commercially?
i
mean,
how
much
--
how
many
of
the
requesters
have
to
be
engaged
in
some
kind
of
commercial
activity
in
order
for
your
arguments
to
work?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
don't
deny
that
in
general,
this
does
affect
out-of-state
data
collectors,
people
who
are
engaged
in
the
kind
of
business
that
justice
breyer
was
talking
about.
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
general,
just
indulge
me
with
a
hypothetical.
suppose
that
the
backgrounds
for
these
statutes
was
different.
the
statutes
were
the
same,
but
in
addition
to
talking
about
people's
right
to
know
about
how
their
government
works,
the
people
spend
a
lot
of
time
also
talking
about
the
economic
benefits
of
a
free
flow
of
information
in
our
country.
would
that
--
if
that
were
true,
and
i
want
to
put
myself
on
record
as
not
remembering
when
these
statutes
were
passed--
[laughter]
but
if
that
were
true,
would
this
case
be
different
or
would
you
still
be
up
here
saying
the
same
thing?
justice
elena
kagan
the
statute
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
there
might
be
two
interests
behind
the
statute;
one
is
about
knowing
the
way
your
government
operates
and
the
other
is
about
free
flows
of
information
in
the
economy.
and
if
both
of
those
things
had
gone
into
the
mix
to
create
the
statutes
of
this
kind,
would
you
be
up
here
saying
the
same
thing
or
not?
justice
elena
kagan
i
think
the
thing,
general,
that
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
very
good
case
that
these
statutes
were
meant
for
a
different
purpose.
but
in
fact,
it
seems
as
though
your
friends
there
have
a
good
case
that
these
statutes
have
been
taken
over,
to
a
large
extent,
across
the
country
by
economic
enterprises
doing
economic
things.
and
at
that
point
in
time,
virginia's
--
and,
you
know,
you
are
only
one
of
two
states
--
virginia's
maintenance
of
this
kind
of
--
no,
it's
virginians,
virginia
information
for
virginians,
looks
very
different
from
what
it
might
have
looked
like
when
the
statute
was
originally
passed.
