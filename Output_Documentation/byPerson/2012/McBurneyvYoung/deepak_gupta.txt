mr.
deepak
gupta
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
all
50
states
have
public
records
laws.
47
of
those
states
make
access
available
to
residents
and
nonresidents
on
equal
terms.
virginia,
by
contrast,
enforces
a
discriminatory
access
policy,
and
because
commercial
requesters
make
up
the
vast
majority
of
records
requesters,
out
of
state
businesses
bear
the
brunt
of
virginia's
policy--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--that's
right.
all
of
these
laws--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--in
the
'60s
and
the
early
'70s.
the
virginia
law
was
enacted
in
1968.
and
we
don't
deny
that--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
to
be
clear,
the
modern
transparency
laws
are
new,
but
they
sit
on
top
of
well-established
common
law
rights
to
access
that
are
based
not
on
modern
notions
of
transparency
but
on
the
right
to
secure
property
and
other
basic
interests--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
it's
true
that
--
that
virginia's
law
exempts
deeds
from
its
freedom
of
information
law,
but
if
i
understand
their
position
correctly,
they
would
be
entitled
as
a
constitutional
matter
under
their
theory
to
preclude
people
from
other
states
from
accessing
even
deeds.
mr.
deepak
gupta
my
client,
mr.
hurlbert,
is
in
the
business
of
gathering
property
records
for
his
clients.
now,
it's
true
that
in
virginia,
he
could
get
the
deed,
but
what
he
can't
get
and
what
he
principally
gathers
for
his
clients
are
real
estate
tax
assessment
records,
and
those
are
a
much
richer
storehouse
of
property-related
information
than
simply
the
deed.
mr.
deepak
gupta
that's
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
he
--
you
know,
he
doesn't
just
do
the
routine
request.
these
--
the
large
data
companies
are
the
ones
who
hire
him.
and
they
--
if
they're
routine
requests,
they
can
do
them
themselves.
although
if
they're
not
based
in
virginia,
they
would
still
have
to
hire
a
virginian
to
do
it.
but
they
bring
him
in
when
there's
some
flaw
in
the
--
the
routine
process
where
the
--
the
state
is
being
recalcitrant,
or
the
local
official
is
being
recalcitrant.
and
he's
an
expert
in
being
able
to
gather
these
--
these
records,
and
knowing
the
process
is
knowing
what
he's
allowed
to
do
and
what
he's
not
allowed
to
do.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
he
could
hire
someone
from
virginia
to
do
that,
but
that's
--
you
know,
that's
sort
of
precisely
what
the--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--he
would
still
have
to
hire
someone,
and
that
would
be
an
increased
cost.
and--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--yeah.
for
the
large
data
companies,
you
know,
they
will
hire
someone
other
than
him
to
perform
this
service.
they
will
--
if
you're
talking
about
routine
requests.
but
even
--
you
know,
even
for
them,
if
you're
talking
about
a
--
a
request
that
isn't
routine,
if
he
has
to
do
something
further
to
enforce
the
rights,
he's
going
to
have
to
do
that
in
his
own
name
or
the
data
company
will
have
to
hire
someone
other
than
him,
someone
based
in
virginia,
to
do
that
for
them.
and
then
he
will
lose
that
business.
so
the
lower
you
go
down
in
the
food
chain
of
the
data
industry,
the
bigger
the
effect
of
virginia's
policy.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
for
him,
in
the
virginia
market,
it
completely
forecloses
him
from
doing
access
--
business
in
the
virginia
market.
and
if
other
states
were
to
have
policies
like
this,
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
business
in
those
states
as
well.
so
if
--
if
the
focus
is
on
him
and
his
business
in
virginia,
it
completely
cuts
him
off.
if
the
focus
is
on
--
on
what
the
effect
is
in
the
aggregate
on
the
market
as
a
whole,
because
most
public
records
requests
are
commercial
requests,
it's
going
to
have
an
effect
on
most
commercial
requesters
who
are
out
of
state.
and--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--a
few
responses,
justice
scalia.
first,
transparency
was
one
purpose,
but
as
i
said,
these
laws
also
carried
forward
the
much
more
longstanding
rights
to
access
based
on
personal
interests
and
property
interests.
also,
even
at
the
time
that
these
laws
were
enacted--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--even
--
even
at
the
time
that
these
laws
were
enacted
in
the
--
in
the
'60s,
it
was
well-understood
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
big
commercial
impact.
the
property
records
industry
was
in
full
swing
by
the
end
of
the
late
19th
century.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
well,
elections
just
simply
don't
work
if
you
--
if
you
allow
noncitizens
to
participate
in
elections,
or
if
you
can't
wall
off
the
state
in
that
respect.
but
what
the
state
can't
say
is
simply
because
one
purpose
of
this
law
is
that
we
want
to
constitute
ourselves
as
a
political
community,
that
we
can
exclude
activities
that
have
a
big
commercial
effect.
and,
you
know,
when
we're
looking
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
or
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
this
court's
cases
have
said
repeatedly
you
don't
look
to
uncover
the
original
legislative
purpose,
you
look
to
whether
there
is
discrimination,
which
there
is
here
on
its
face,
and
you
look
to
whether
there
is
a
discriminatory
effect.
one
example
of
how
this
policy
is
actually
being--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
there
is
no
de
minimis
exception
if
there's
discrimination
against
commerce,
but
here,
what's
going
on
is
anything
but
de
minimis.
virginia
does
not
deny
that
the
--
the
vast
majority
of
the
requesters
are
commercial
requesters,
the
vast
majority
of
out
of
state
requesters
are
commercial
requesters.
their
--
the
amicus
brief
supporting
their
side,
the
local
government
attorneys
of
virginia
amicus
brief
at
page
30
explains
the
way
this
policy
is
being
implemented,
is
that
noncommercial
requests
are
typically
honored,
but
out
of
state
requests
by
data
miners
are
being
categorically
denied
under
the
policy.
mr.
deepak
gupta
but
that's
--
that
was
the
fourth
circuit's
theory
and
i
think
incidental
can
mean
a
few
different
things,
and
i
think
in
--
in
their
opinion,
it
--
it
does
mean
at
least
three
different
things.
so
maybe
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
try
to
unpack
that.
if
it
means
incidental
in
terms
of
the
effect
on
my
client's
business
--
i
think,
as
i've
explained,
it's
anything
but
incidental;
it
completely
forecloses
him
from
the
market.
if
it
means
incidental
in
terms
of
the
--
the
aggregate
effect
of
this
statute,
again,
it's
not
incidental
because
the
vast
majority
of
--
of
affected
parties
under
this
policy
are
out-of-state
commercial
requesters,
particularly
data
companies.
and,
you
know,
if
it
means
incidental
compared
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
i've
said,
transparency
was
one
purpose
of
the
modern
foia
laws,
but
they
also
subsumed
and
sit
on
top
of
all
of
the
longstanding
rights
of
public
access
that
have
been
around
since
the
--
the
first
settlements
in
the
united
states
--
or
before
the
united
states,
when
in
order
to
have
a
functioning
property
system,
we
recognized
that
you've
got
to
have
records
of
who
owns
what
and
--
and
those
records
have
to
be
made
available
to
anyone
in
order
to
exercise
property
rights.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
i
don't
think
so.
and
there
are
a
couple
of
distinctions.
first,
that's
not
something
that
the
state
exclusively
is
able
to
provide.
it's
not
like
the
courthouse
or
the
public
archives
across
the
street
or
the
road
that
runs
between
them
that
only
the
--
the
state
is
able
to
provide.
anyone
can
provide
a
business
training
institute,
so
the
state
is
just
one
player
among
many.
also--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
maybe
i
didn't
explain
it
very
well.
to
be
clear,
i
think
it's
more
than
just
a
difference
in
degree;
it's
a
difference
in
kind.
these
are
fundamentally
different
when
--
when
you're
talking
about
running
the
courthouse
or
running
the
public
archives,
nobody
else
can
do
that.
nobody
else
can
collect
--
you
know,
make
tax
assessments,
collect
those
records
and
keep
the
official
public
archive
of
those
things.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
to
the
extent
that
you
--
you
think
it
does
matter,
i
mean,
that
--
that
distinction
doesn't
matter
in
this
case
because
the
impact
is
--
is
great.
the
principal
impact
is
an
impact
on
out-of-state
commerce.
but
let
me--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--no.
i
think
this
--
if
you
were
in
--
in
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
this
would
be
the
per
se
rule
of
invalidity.
you
have
facial
discrimination.
the
--
the--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
no.
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
--
that
the
first
--
sort
of
first-tier
scrutiny,
the
per
se
rule
is
--
is
for
cases
where
there's
discrimination
on
its
face
or
discrimination
in
effect.
and
then
you've
got
this
other
category
for
the
--
the
pike
analysis
where
the
state
regulates
evenhandedly.
mr.
deepak
gupta
when
you
say
“
this
”,
you
mean
the
--
that
public
records
access
is
commerce?
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
i
think
if
you're
--
if
you're
--
if
the
question
is
about
whether
or
not
records
access
is
commerce,
there's
reno
v.
condon
this
court's
unanimous--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
i
think,
you
know,
this
court's
unanimous
decision
in
reno
v.
condon
held
that
because
people
buy
public
records
and
sell
them
in
interstate
commerce,
that's
indisputably
interstate
commerce.
so
we--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--that's
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
virginia
doesn't
deny
that
there's
discrimination
on
its
face,
so
i
take
your
question
to
be
asking,
you
know,
what
about
the
commerce
aspect.
and
in
reno
v.
condon--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--yeah,
i
mean,
you
--
okay.
so
you
can
also
look
to
camps
newfound,
which,
i
think,
you
know,
was
much,
more
attenuated
to
commerce.
there
you
had
a
generally
applicable
law,
a
property
tax
law--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--yeah.
mr.
deepak
gupta
yeah.
i
mean,
you
know,
look.
there's
no
case
that's
--
that's
entirely
on
all
fours,
but--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--so
right.
so
--
so
--
okay.
so
the
camps
newfound
case
is
--
is
a
case
where
you
had
a
generally
applicable
law.
it
was
a
property
tax
law.
it
exempted,
you
know,
charities
that
served
primarily
in-state
residents.
it
was
--
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
state
of
maine
intended
that
to
be
a,
you
know,
a
discrimination
against
commerce,
and
obviously
swept
more
broadly
and
affected
both
commerce
and
non-commerce.
but
this
court
said
that,
you
know,
you
had
facial
discrimination
against
commerce
because
there
were
people
operating
these
summer
camps
and
they
were
treated
differently--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
well,
i
mean,
one
--
you
know,
one
piece
of
evidence,
justice
breyer,
is
the
media
exception
to
the
virginia
statute.
it
--
this
--
this
makes
it
clear
that
virginia
was
aware
that
people
who
were
requesting
information
for
commercial
purposes
were
going
to
use
this
statute
and
they
exempted
the
press--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--that's
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
deepak
gupta
that's
right.
so
it's
--
it's--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
if
this
is
a
statute,
it's
a
pretty
unusual
statute
that
discriminates
among
newspapers.
so
it
says--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--there
is
a
separate
virginia--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--yes.
there
is
a
separate
virginia
statute
that
allows
this.
mr.
deepak
gupta
that's
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
that's
correct.
mr.
deepak
gupta
uh-huh.
mr.
deepak
gupta
sure.
you
know,
that
--
we
don't
deny
that
that's
an
interest
that
the
state
has,
but
then
you
have
to
see
whether
the
--
the
interest
is
reasonably
furthered
by
the
statute.
and
here
you
have
a
resource
that
is
not
finite
and
the
statute
allows
the
state
to
recoup
its
expenses.
so
nothing
is
lost
to
virginians.
there
isn't
any
loss
in
transparency
to
virginians
by
extending
access
to
out-of-state
data
companies.
mr.
deepak
gupta
but
--
but
there's
no
loss
in
resources,
justice
ginsburg,
because
the
statute
allows
virginia
to
fully
recoup
any
administrative
expenses.
mr.
deepak
gupta
yeah.
that
--
that
is
certainly
their
interest.
but
you've
got
to
see
whether
the
policy
serves
--
serves,
you
know,
the
interest,
and
--
and
this
is
a
statute
that
is
supposed
to
promote
transparency.
it
actually
makes
less
transparent.
mr.
deepak
gupta
no,
not
at
all.
i
mean--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--it's
the
privilege
or
immunity
of
pursuing
a
common
calling
across
state
borders.
so
there's
no
dispute
here
that
mr.
hurlbert's
common
calling
is
--
is
gathering
data.
in
fact,
those
are
the
principal
users
of
public
records
laws.
mr.
deepak
gupta
that's
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
that's
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
yes.
so
--
so
it's
an
as-applied
challenge
with
respect
to
mr.
hurlbert's
common
calling.
there's
no
--
there's
no
dispute
that
that
is
his
common
calling
and
that
this
law
has
the
effect
of
completely
cutting
him
off
from
pursuing
his
common
calling
in
the
virginia
market
and
that
47
other
states--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--right.
i
mean,
you
would,
you
know,
we
would
--
we
would
ask
that
you
rule
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him
and
then
virginia
would
have
the
choice
if
it
has
a
to
the
statute--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--well,
he's
--
all
he's
asking
for
is
information
that's
available
in
the
public
archives
on
equal
terms
with
virginians.
in
the
same
way
that
--
that
someone
who--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--no.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
but
this
is
--
this
is
a
profession
that
has
existed
since
the
founding
era.
i
mean,
we've,
you
know,
we've
cited
cases
in
our
opening
brief
of
--
of
people
hiring
professionals
to
search
the
records
for
them
before
engaging
in
property
transactions.
by
the
late
19th
century,
you
had
an
enormous
industry
that
was
designed
to
do
this.
so
this
isn't
--
mr.
hurlbert
isn't
some
--
someone
who's
making
up
some
profession.
he's
part
of
a
very
large
industry
that
has
done
this
for
a
very
long
time.
and
that
industry,
yes,
like
lawyers
depend
on
courthouses
or
truckers
depend
on
roads,
his
industry
depends
on
access
to
the
public
archives.
and,
you
know,
it's
true
that
--
that
now
you
have
these
modern
public
records
laws,
but
i
--
i
think
virginia's
argument
would
be
the
same
if
you
were
just
talking
about
can
--
can
they
bar
the
doors
to
the
archives
building?
can
they
bar
the
doors
to
the
property
records?
so
there's
no
--
i
don't
see
any
distinction
in
kind--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--you
know,
i
think
the
logic
of
both
arguments
are
similar,
but
i
think
it
most
clearly
is
illustrated
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
context
where--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--i
don't
think
it's
a
stretch
at
all,
justice
--
chief
justice.
the
--
the
aggregators
of
records
make
possible
mortgage
origination,
credit
reporting,
insurance
adjustment.
the
--
the
economy
--
and
you
have
an
amicus
brief--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--no,
no.
not
to
this
kind
of
information.
the
--
the
information
that
mr.
hurlbert
is
gathering,
tax
assessment
information,
is
essential
to
--
to
mortgage
origination
and
credit
reporting.
the
people
who
hire
him
are
large
data
companies,
and
the
--
the
data
industry
brief
explains
the
uses
of
this
information.
that
--
that
information
is
essential
to
these
activities.
and
virginia,
virtually
alone
among
the
states,
is
--
is
erecting
this
barrier
to
access
that
market,
and
reserving
the
right
to
access
that
market
to
only
people
who
live
in
the
state.
and
--
and,
you
know,
this
would
be
no
different
if
it
were
just
talking
about
the
archives
that
--
that
include
all
the
information
that
the
--
yes,
it's
true
that
virginia
has
exempted
of
the
title
itself,
but
i
don't
see
that
the
logic
of
their
position
allows
them
to
make
that
distinction.
i
mean,
that's
just
a
feature
of
their
--
of
their
statute.
mr.
deepak
gupta
i
think
that
would
be
a
closer
question,
but
i
think
that
presents
some
problems
as
well.
i
mean,
so
in
your
hypothetical
it's
free
to
the
citizens
of
the
state,
but
they're
just
passing
the
cost
on
to
out-of-staters.
and,
you
know,
this
--
this
court
in
cases
like
toomer
and
mullaney
have
said
that
at
least,
you
know,
where
the
state
can
show
that
the
nonresidents
pose
some
unique
evil,
that
the
--
the
state
is
entitled
to
pass
the
costs
on.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
mr.
deepak
gupta
right.
but
--
but
that
would
be
discriminating
against
not
as
--
noncitizens
solely
because
they're
noncitizens.
so
if
there's
some
particular--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--right.
well,
that's
--
that's
precisely
the
rationale
that
--
that
in
justice
kennedy's
opinion
for
the
court
in
barnard
v.
thorstenn,
this
court
rejected.
this
--
the
virgin
islands
wanted
to
say
if
we
open
up
our
bar
to
people
from
all
over
the
country,
it's
going
to
increase
the
administrative
resources,
and
this
court
said,
no,
that's
not
a
good
a
enough
reason.
that's
just
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
citizenship.
but
if,
for
example,
the
state
could
show
that
there
was,
you
know,
there
were
shipping
costs
that
were
uniquely
posed
by
nonresidents
and
they
wanted
to
assess
a
$5
shipping
fee
for
all
nonresidents,
that
might
be
permissible.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
deepak
gupta
thank
you.
just
a
few
quick
points.
first,
i
just
want
to
clear
up
on
the
statute,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
this
statute
does
allow
the
state
to
fully
recoup
its
costs,
including
administrative
costs,
and
the
state
hasn't
said
otherwise.
and
secondly,
the
suggestion
has
been
made--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--that
--
that's
right,
justice
scalia--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--that
--
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
and
that's
true
of
other
things,
like
roads
and
courthouses.
and
i
think
this
gets
to
--
justice
breyer
asked
for
our
test
to
try
to
differentiate
this
from
other
services
and
i'd
like
to
try
to
provide
one.
i
think,
at
least
where
you've
got
a
function
that
is
reserved
to
the
state
--
only
the
state
can
do
it,
only
the
state
can
run
the
archives
--
it's
necessary
as
a
channel
to
--
to
commerce.
and
in
the
--
in
the
modern
economy,
this
is
as
much
part
of
the
information
infrastructure
as
transportation
is,
like
courthouses,
like
archives,
like
roads.
it
would
not
stretch
limited
resources;
it
would
not
cost
the
state
additional
money;
and
it
would
not
jeopardize
important
local
traditions
or
institutions--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--and
i
think
we
feel
comfortable--
mr.
deepak
gupta
--right.
and
i
--
i
think
the
test
that
i
just
laid
out
would
work
for
both
clauses.
it's
a
limiting
principle
on
the
justification
side.
but
that's
right:
mr.
mcburney
does
not
have
a
dormant
commerce
clause
claim.
his
claim
is
based
on
equal
access
to
proceedings.
he
wanted
to
get
recovery
of
child
support
that
he
was
owed.
so
he
is
a
creditor
seeking
to
pursue
a
debt
on
equal
terms
with
people
in
the
state
of
virginia,
and
the
state
set
up
a
process:
as
one
step
along
the
way
to
court,
you
go
to
the
agency;
you
ask
the
agency
to
enforce.
the
agency
has
unique
enforcement
tools.
it
can
suspend
someone's
driver's
license,
for
example.
it
can
--
it
can
intercept
income
tax
refunds,
and
it
can
go
to
court
on
your
behalf.
and
all
he's
asking
for
is
the
rules
of
the
game.
he
wants
to
know
what
procedures
apply
to
that
process.
and
at
least
where
a
--
an
agency
has
a
process
that
directly
affects
a
non-stater
in
the
pocketbook,
all
we
are
saying
is
that
equal
access
to
the
proceedings
means
equal
access
to
the
information
governing
those
proceedings.
and,
finally,
i
would
just
like
to
close
by
saying
that,
you
know,
what
i
don't
think
we
heard
on
the
justification
side
from
the
state
was
really
any
justification,
because
the
state
can
recoup
its
costs.
and
so
they
are
not
saying
that
this
will
cost
them
anything
more.
which
was
the
only
justification
they
pressed
in
--
in
the
courts
below.
and
so
they
are
left
with
the
position
that
they
can
discriminate
simply
because
they
think
they
can.
and
if
you
look
at
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
it
sits
right
next
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
which
indicates,
if
anything,
that
the
framers
thought
that
the
movement
of
public
records
across
state
lines
was
important
to
interstate
comity.
they
changed
the
articles
of
confederation
version,
which
did
not
include
public
records;
it
only
referred
to
judicial
records.
they
added
a
mention
of
judicial
records
--
nonjudicial
records
and
saw
that
that
was
important
to
--
to
comity
across
state
lines.
but
--
but
their
position
is
about
the
step
before
that.
it's
about
whether
you
get
the
records
in
the
first
place.
thank
you.
