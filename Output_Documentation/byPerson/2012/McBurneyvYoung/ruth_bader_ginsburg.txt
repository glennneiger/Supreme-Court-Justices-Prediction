justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
--
can
you
explain
that
business
a
little
more
fully
than
you
did
in
the
briefs?
he's
in
the
business
of
collecting
records
from
all
the
states
about
tax
assessments.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
he
--
and
he
does
that
for
a
client
who
could
very
well
ask
himself.
so
what
is
the
service
that's
being
performed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
much
--
how
much
of
an
impact
in
fact
does
it
have
on
his
business?
i
mean,
there
are
47
states
who
will
provide
this
information.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
point
is
that
foia
is
tied
to,
as
justice
scalia
said,
the
citizens
should
know
what
their
government
is
doing.
and
you
don't
have
to
give
any
reason
at
all,
if
you
were
a
part
of
that
political
community.
now,
virginia
doesn't
allow
people
from
out
of
state
to
vote.
they're
not
part
of
virginia's
political
community.
so
why
isn't
this
--
if
you're
not
part
of
the
political
community,
then
you
don't
fall
under
foia,
which
is
a
peculiar
statute,
in
that
everybody
who
is
covered
by
it
can
get
whatever
they
want,
and
they
don't
have
to
give
any
reason
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it
costs
for
virginia
--
virginia
has
to
take
care
of
its
own,
and
if
it
has
to
service
foia
requests
from
all
over,
it's
going
to
cost
the
state.
it's
going
to
have
to
hire
people
to
do
this.
they're
going
to
have
to
spend
many
hours
going
through
these
records.
so
the
state
doesn't
--
it
wants
to
conserve
its
resources
for
its
own
people.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you
would
be
doing
something
very
strange
with
this
statute,
because
you
would
be
saying
hurlbert
has
a
right
to
this
because
it's
his
business.
but
the
statute,
the
character
of
this
statute
is
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
want
the
information
for.
but
you're
saying
the
out-of
--
the
in-stater,
it
doesn't
matter.
out-of-stater,
is
it
your
argument
that
if
this
out-of-stater
has
a
good
reason
for
getting
this
and
it's
related
to
the
out-of-state's
business,
so
you
--
you're
changing
the
character
of
a
foia
statute
which
is
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
want
it
for.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
has--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
else
can
virginia
do
besides
--
i
don't
know
if
there
are
elk
in
virginia,
but
besides
--
to
reserve
for
its
own
--
for
its
own
people?
you
say,
this
is
--
good
government
in
virginia
is
for
virginians.
big
game
hunting,
scarce
resource,
can
be
reserved
for
in-state
people.
what
else
can
virginia
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
leaving
out--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
leaving
it
--
you
--
you
switched
now
--
and
you
were
led
there
but
you
switched
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
what
about
your
other
client,
mcburney?
he
doesn't
have
any
dormant
commerce
clause
claim.
