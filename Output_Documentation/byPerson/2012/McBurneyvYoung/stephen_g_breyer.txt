justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
only
have
time
to
read
one
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
possibly
two,
which
would
you
like
me
to
read?
i
think
that's
basically
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
but
i
assume
you
don't
want
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--look
at
those.
but
i
think
the
commerce
clause
basically
has
as
its
objective,
insofar
as
it's
dormant,
to
prevent
a
legislature
or
decisionmaker
within
its
state
discriminating
in
favor
of
their
own
state
producers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
it's
pretty
hard
for
me
to
put
this
case
into
that
mold.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
does
what
the
--
i
had
exactly
the
same
question
for
both
parts
of
your
argument,
that,
what
it's
their
--
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
anyone
can
get
any
information
--
anyone
in
any
state
can
get
any
information
that
pertains
to
him
or
her?
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know,
whether
it's
separate
or
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anyone
from
alaska
to
hawaii
can
get
any
information
that
pertains
to
him
or
her.
second,
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
judicial
records.
there
is
a
different
statute
that
makes
judicial
records
public.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
we're
now
talking
about
the
class
of
information
other
than
the
two
classes
i've
mentioned.
and
i
then
ended
up,
and
i'd
like
you
to
add
something
to
this,
if
you
can,
that
really
this
is
about,
since
getting
information
involves
usually
a
benefit
to
the
recipient,
but
sometimes
harm
to
the
person
the
information
is
about,
that
willing
to
run
that
harm
and
risk
of
harm
is
the
interest
in
state
good
government,
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
that's
the
interest,
that's
an
interest
that
probably
a
state
has
the
right,
just
as
it
has
the
right
to
say
other
people
can't
vote
in
state
elections.
if
that's
the
interest,
then
i
guess
it
could
take
reasonable
measures
related
to
that
interest.
all
right.
now,
that
is
the
--
the
argument
or
the
position
that
i
would
appreciate
your
addressing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
--
he
has
a
very
reasonable
request
in
my
view,
but
the
question
isn't
the
reasonableness
of
his
request.
the
question's,
you
know,
whether
they
can
do
it.
and
the
--
the
way
--
the
work
--
the
thing
that's
bothering
me
on
the
work
part
is
this:
it
seems
that
the
work
is
sort
of
tailored
to
the
statute.
it's
in
this
way.
i
--
i
have
a
job
and
my
job
is
to
study
election
processes.
and
i
write
reports
and
i
find
amazing
things
about
differences
among
states.
they're
truly
amazing.
and
i
say,
you
know,
it
would
help
me
a
lot
if
i
was
actually
a
voter
in
each
of
these
states.
that
would
help
my
job.
it
would
lend
authenticity
and
i
could
learn
things
that
i
probably
couldn't
learn
otherwise.
now,
does
that
add
anything
to
the
argument?
i
mean,
i
don't
think
so,
but
it
sounds
a
little
bit
like
you're
making
that
kind
of
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
--
and
they
either
do
have
the
right
or
they
don't.
and
i
don't
know
that
it
helps
that
i
--
that
i
say,
well,
i
really
want
it
for
my
work.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
where
he
comes
in
with
his
argument.
because
i
--
i
agree,
you
can
--
you
don't
have
--
let's
say
the
most
fabulous
reason
for
doing
this,
but
you
have
a
reason.
and
so
the
question
is,
does
it
have
to
be
better
than
that?
and
--
and
they
are
saying
yes.
and
as
i
heard
it,
what
i
would
characterize
as
a
strong
argument,
which
sort
of
first
of
all
strikes
me
as
a
stronger
argument,
is
that,
look,
if
we
go
back
into
history,
out
of
state
real
estate
people
could
always
get
information
about
property
--
let's
say
they
had
a
client
who
wanted
to
buy
it.
now,
you've
protected
that.
but
in
today's
world,
it's
important
that
we
get
statistics
about
this,
too,
because
our
economy
is
national.
if
we
understand
how
states
are
taxing
their
real
estate,
we
will
know
to
what
extent
they
increase
the
value,
to
what
extent
they
increase
the
rate,
to
what
extent
they
really
get
the
money
they
are
supposed
to,
to
what
extent
they
might
get
money
or
not
get
money
in
the
future.
and
all
of
those
things
are
nationally
important
so
people
can
put
them
together
and
make,
better
than
we
have
done
in
the
past,
predictions
about
what
is
likely
to
happen
to
states,
and
hence,
the
national
economy.
all
right?
that's
--
that's
the
kind
of
argument
he's
making.
so
therefore,
there
is
a
national
interest
in
the
flow
of
this
information.
and
that
means
you
have
to
have
a
better
than
“
uh-huh
”
kind
of
rationale.
that's
--
that's
what
he's
saying.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
to
be
fair,
i
--
i
was
sort
of
expanding
it.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
--
there
--
suppose
--
i
think
they
have
an
argument,
saying
of
course
this
information
would
be
useful
for
gathering
national
statistics
and
helping
the
national
economy.
i
think
that's
true.
on
the
other
hand
you
say,
well,
but
look,
there
must
be
something
left
that
the
states
can
reserve
to
their
own
citizens.
there
must
be
something.
they
can't
protect
their
own
commerce;
that's
clear.
they
can't
discriminate
against
people
who
want
to
come
here
and
live
here.
that's
clear.
they
can't
do
this
and
that
and
the
other
thing,
but
gee,
there
must
be
something.
i
mean
can't
they
reserve
at
least
their
--
their
beaches
for
their
own
citizens?
no.
parking
near
their
beaches?
well,
maybe.
and
--
and
maybe
deer.
and
if
not
this,
what?
that's
the
end.
okay?
so
that's
basically
what
you
are
saying.
this
is
just
an
interest
in
trying
to
find
out
how
state
institutions
work,
and
the
voters
have
the
main
interest
there,
and
this
is
other
--
so
you
say
the
other
one
is
attenuated,
but
not
non-existent.
he
says
the
other
is
important,
though
he
recognizes
states
should
be
able
to
do
something.
so
if
you
were
me,
how
would
you
decide?
how
would
you
choose?
what
is
the
standard,
because
you
know
the
--
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
is
--
is
considerably
opaque,
and
there
are
very
few
cases
on
it.
and
so
what
--
how
would
you
tell
me
to
--
to
resolve
that
--
that
tension,
because
there
is
a
tension.
