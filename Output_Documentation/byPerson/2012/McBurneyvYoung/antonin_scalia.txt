justice
antonin
scalia
when
--
when
was
the
first
of
those
laws
enacted,
do
you
know?
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
in
my
adult
lifetime
that
florida
was
the
first
to
enact
a
sunshine
law.
is
that
--
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
'60s.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that's
a
fundamental
--
that's
a
fundamental
right
covered
by
a
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
which
nobody
had
until
the
1960s.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
those
--
those
rights
still
exist
in
this
state,
don't
they?
cannot
you
get
records
of
deeds
and
whatever
the
common
law
would
have
covered?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'll
ask
him
--
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
their
position,
but
--
but
i
guess
we
can
ask
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gupta,
i
--
i
understand
that
the
--
the
reasoning
of
virginia
in
not
allowing
out
of
state
people
to
--
to
get
these
foia
requests
is
the
following:
that
the
purpose
of
these
--
these
laws
--
and
i
remember
it
when
the
first
ones
were
enacted
--
government
in
the
sunshine.
the
purpose
of
it
was
not
to
enable
people
to
get
information
per
se,
it
was
to
enable
people
to
see
how
their
government
is
working,
so
that
they
could
attend
to
any
malfeasance
that
is
occurring
in
the
process
of
government.
it
seems
to
me
entirely
in
accord
with
that
purpose
of
these
laws
to
say
it's
only
virginia
citizens
who
--
who
are
concerned
about
the
functioning
of
virginia
government,
and
ought
to
be
able
to
get
whatever
records
virginia
agencies
have.
what's
--
what's
wrong
with
that
reasoning?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
--
but
you
don't
need
any
personal
or
property
interest
under
these
laws.
you
can
just
--
out
of
curiosity,
if
you
--
if
you
were
a
virginian
at
least
in
virginia,
even
though
you
have
no
interest
in
the
matter
at
all,
you
can
ask
the
agency
for
records
about
this
or
that.
it
--
it
can't
be
based
on
--
on
the
traditional
property
interest.
it's
based
on
the
ability
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
to
find
out
what
the
--
what
the
government
of
the
state
is
up
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
--
that
just
goes
to
the
extent
of
the
impact,
not
--
not
on
the
principle.
and
you
say
extent
doesn't
matter.
you
say
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
de
minimis
exception.
so
that
--
that
explanation
doesn't
--
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
hold
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what?
except
to
the
extent
that
that
bears
upon
how
much
of
an
imposition
this
is
upon
interstate
commerce.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
only
relevance
of
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
--
and
you
dismiss
that
relevance.
you
say
it
doesn't
matter
how
extensive
the
impact
is
on
--
on
interstate
commerce.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
virginia
media,
though,
isn't
it?
isn't
it
only
media
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--exists
or
is
broadcast
into
virginia?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that's
consistent
with
their
purpose
that
this
statute
is
meant
to
assure
good,
honest
government
in
virginia.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
--
but
they
just
don't
want
out
--
they
--
they
don't
want
outlanders
mucking
around
in
--
in
virginia
government.
it's
perfectly
okay
for
good
old
virginians
to
do
that,
but
they
don't
want
outlanders
to
do
it.
why
--
why
is
that
unreasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
virginia
citizens
pay
for
that
database,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
out-of-staters
don't
pay
for
the
database.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
besides,
do
--
do
you
--
is
it
the
law
that
--
that
the
state
of
virginia
cannot
do
anything
that's
pointless?
only
the
federal
government
can
do
stuff
that's
pointless?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
for
commercial
purposes.
don't
you
think
if
--
if
those
who
created
these
government
in
the
sunshine
laws
could
have
drafted
them
in
such
a
way
that
inquiries
for
commercial
purposes
would
not
be
allowed,
but
only
those
inquiries
that
are
intended
to
look
into
the
workings
of
state
government
and
produce
government
in
the
sunshine,
don't
you
think
that
they
probably
would
have
excluded
commercial
inquiries
if
they
could?
but
you
can't
tell
which
ones
are
commercial
and
which
aren't.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
that
it's
no
more
necessary
for
you
to
show
that
there's
no
commercial
value
to
allowing
out-of-staters
to
do
this
than
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
show
that
there
is
no
commercial
value
to
your
not
allowing
out-of-staters
to
hunt
deer
in
virginia.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
that
it's
up
to
virginia--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
out-of-staters
can
hunt
for
virginia
game.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
up
to
virginia
whether
out-of-staters
can
have
access
to
the
state's
records,
that
they
have
no
interest
in
personally,
under
this
law.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
logical.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
your
argument
on
it,
i
reject
it
as
justice
kennedy
does.
i
didn't
understand
you
to
be
arguing
that
there
is
no
commercial
value.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
say
discriminatory
regulation.
what
about
tax?
i
mean,
you
can't
tax
discriminatorily,
and
i
wouldn't
call
taxation
in
and
of
itself
a
regulation
of
commerce,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it's
--
even
though
it's
not
a
regulation
of
commerce?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that's
your
argument
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
talking
about
state-owned
documents,
aren't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
not
much
that's
as
close
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
as
the
possession
and
right
to
exclude
people
from
its
own
records
and
its
own
documents,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
--
the
issue
is,
can
the
state
allow
its
own
citizens
for
purposes
of
seeing
that
the
government
is
--
is
being
run
on
the
up-and-up,
have
access
to
those
documents
without
letting
the
whole
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
the
--
i
--
i
think
what
he's
saying
is:
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
costs
of
developing
and
maintaining
those
records,
which
costs
are
paid
by
the
citizens
of
virginia,
which
gives
them
an
additional
interest
in
being
able
to
get
to
those
documents.
you
--
you
don't
claim
that
--
that
you
pay
for
the
development
and
the
maintenance
of
those
records.
you
just
pay
for
the
incremental
costs
of
giving
it
to
you,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
virginians
pay
for
all
the
rest?
