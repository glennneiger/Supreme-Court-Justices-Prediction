what's
your
closest
case
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
this
is
impermissible
as
a
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce?
what's
your
best
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
--
if
you
--
you
are
arguing,
as
one
of
your
arguments
here,
that
this
is
discriminatory
as
to
--
as
to
interstate
commerce,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
what
is
the
best
case
you
have
to
support
your
position?
what's
the
closest
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my
question
is
what's
the
best
case
you
have
for
your
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
wasn't
a
discrimination.
that
wasn't
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
just
--
that
goes
to
the
question
whether
or
not
this
is
commerce.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
best
case
to
show
that
this
is
discriminatory
in
violation
of
our
precedence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
i
have
to
write
the
opinion,
what
case
do
i
put
down?
i'm
waiting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
why
you're
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
telling
us
that
there
is
simply
no
commercial
consequences
to
this
statute
at
all,
that
virginians
find
this
to
be
of
no
commercial
value
in
any
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
were
the
one
with
summary
judgment.
maybe
they
didn't
come
forward
with
the
information,
but
we
interpret
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
losing
party.
and
so
you
say
you
are
totally
agnostic.
i
am
concerned
you
are
preventing
them
by
the
summary
judgment
from
showing
that
their
--
even
with
virginians,
there
is
a
commercial
value
frequently
to
this
information.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
just
political.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
talk
about
the
commerce
clause.
you
are
saying
you
are
agnostic.
you
have
no
idea
whether
or
not
there
might
be
some
commercial
value
to
this
information.
i
would
think
as
an
officer
of
the
state
of
virginia
or
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
we
would
take
notice
that
there
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
assumes
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
general
commercial
interest
in
these
--
in
these
--
in
these
documents.
and
you
say,
oh,
you
are
agnostic.
at
least
that
means
you
are
open
to
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
commercial
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
pike
is
not
relevant
here.
pike
involves
--
the
southern
pacific
v.
arizona
where
there
were
melons
--
where
there
were
melons
and
arizona
wanted
to
make
sure
that
you
had
labels
and
packing
of
the
melons
in
arizona.
that
was
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce.
that's
not
--
that's
not
dormant
commerce
clause
but
that
is
discrimination,
and
there
is
discrimination
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
--
you
could
say
the
same
thing,
we
don't
discriminate
against
californians
who
want
to
come
and
pack
their
melons
in
arizona.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
--
it
would
surprise
me
if
an
out-of-state
investor
who
was
thinking
of
putting
a
large
plant
in
virginia
had
absolutely
no
interest
in
virginia's
tax
policies.
