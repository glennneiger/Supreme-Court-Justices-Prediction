justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
having--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
i'm
--
i
--
there
is
underlying
your
argument
a
sort
of
fundamental
belief
that
you
are
entitled
to
relief
--
pardon
the
alliteration
simply
because
the
statute
discriminates
between
citizens
and
noncitizens.
is
that
your
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
if
it's
not,
what
are
the
two
rights
that
you
--
or
what
rights
are
it
that
you're
claiming
have
been
violated?
you
say
privileges
and
immunities.
what's
the
privilege
or
immunity?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
this
an
as-applied
challenge
to
the--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i'm
having
a
problem,
and
then
i
think
it's
justice
ginsburg's
problem,
which
is
absent
the
statute,
he
can't
demand
that
virginia
provide
him
with
this
information
because
that's
how
he
wants
to
work,
correct?
so
what's
the
added
value
that
gives
him
a
right
to
demand
it
merely
because
a
statute
exists?
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
the
information.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
still
trying
to
tease
out
what
your
claim
is.
let's
suppose
virginia
passes
a
statute
that
says:
we'll
let
nonresidents
have
access,
but
they
have
to
pay
all
the
costs.
nonresidents
don't.
would
that
satisfy
you
as
valid?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
it
just
--
you
just
being
costs
them
more?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
was
justice
ginsburg's
point,
which
is
every
time
you've
put
in
a
request,
you're
costing
them
more
money.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
why?
you
were
costing
them
more.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
not
sure
how
you
save
administrative
costs
under
this
statute.
they
could
go
to
any
virginia
resident,
it's
not
illegal,
and
probably
will,
it'll
cost
them
something
more,
but
not
you,
and
get
the
very
same
information.
so
how
do
you
justify
this
discrimination?
because
it's
so
easily
--
the
administrative
cost
is
going
to
be
imposed
anyway.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
want
to
give
more
businesses
to
virginia
citizens
who
will
now
charge
out-of-state
residents
money
to
process
their
foia
requests?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
keep
making
that
argument.
but
you
don't
stop
residents
for
asking
for
the
information
from
someone
else.
i
mean,
that's
one
of
the
points
of
your
law,
which
is,
they
can
hire
a
virginia
resident
to
get
it
for
them.
most
of
the
big
people
are
doing
that
already.
so
you're
not
saving
any
money
if
they
can
get
the
information
simply
by
paying
someone
in
virginia
to
get
it
for
them.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
only
in
his
privileges
and
immunities
clause
claim.
he
claims
that
the
dormant
commerce
clause
has
been
effected
because
he
reads
this
statute
as
saying
only
virginia
recording
companies
have
access.
out-of-state
can't.
and
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute.
it
only
permits
virginia
residents,
which
include
commercial
and
noncommercial,
to
access
the
information.
so
assume
hypothetically
that
the
statute
reads
"only
virginia
commercial
businesses
have
access
to
this
information--
"
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--well,
that's
the
question
i'm
--
i'm
raising
the
best
argument
for
your
adversary,
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
we
could
call
it
a
direct
--
he
calls
it
direct
discrimination,
because
commercial
businesses
are
being
permitted
in
virginia
but
not
noncommercial.
you
say
it's
indirect.
how
do
we
draw
the
line
between
direct
and
indirect
when
the
bottom-line
consequence
is
the
same?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
doesn't
the
dormant
commerce
clause
affect
the
hypothetical
i
laid
out?
because
directly
this
permits
virginia
commercial
businesses
to
get
something
that
out-of-staters
can't.
the
state
is
putting
this
instrument
into
commerce.
you
say,
i
don't
know
that.
but
make
the
assumption
that
we
think
the
record's
clear
enough
on
that
point.
i
know
you
want
to
fight
me
on
that,
but
it's
hard
--
it's
a
fight
with
no
legs.
because
you
have
to
know
that
commercial
enterprises
in
virginia
seek
these
records.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
tell
us
under
our
jurisprudence,
the
dormant
common
commerce
jurisprudence
--
i
have
colleagues
who
don't
--
who
don't
believe
it
should
exist.
take
that
argument
out.
why
is
this
not
a
dormant
commerce
clause
case?
