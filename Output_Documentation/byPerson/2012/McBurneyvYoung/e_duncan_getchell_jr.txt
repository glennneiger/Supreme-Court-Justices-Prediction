mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
would
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
political,
not
commercial,
left
the
state
with
the
position
that
it
was
going
to
subsidize
with
tax
dollars
this
function
because
we
can't
recover
our
overhead;
we
can
over
--
only
recover
the
actual
cost.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
anybody
was
thinking
about
businesses
of
any
sort.
i
think
they
were
saying
that
we
have
a
political
hygiene
statute.
they
were
very
much
the
fad.
it
happened
in
my
lifetime,
too.
i
remember
when
they
were
adopted.
nobody
thought
they
were
commercial
in
nature.
and
i
do
want
to
--
want
to
repel
the
notion
that
there
is
even
substantial
discrimination
in
this
case,
because
mr.
hurlbert,
in
his
admission
that
this
is
an
as-applied
challenge,
has
a
difficulty
with
substantial
equality
of
access,
because
it
turns
out
that
mr.
hurlbert,
in
his
reply
brief,
when
he
teed
up
the
1786
statute,
which
does
give
access
--
did
give
access,
he
focused
his
argument
on
that
statute.
and
if
you
run
that
statute,
you
will
find
that
between
1830
--
1813
and
1840,
that
you
did
not
have
general
access.
they
went
back
to
having
to
show
a
particular
interest.
but
that
--
from
1840,
'41
until
today,
through
the
codes
of
1819
and
--
and
up
until
the
present
code,
section
17.1208,
he
has
the
right
of
access
to
tax
assessment
records.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it's
just
not
part
of
the
interests
the
state
was
trying
to
serve.
the
state--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--the
--
we
are
here
to
defend
the
decisions
of
the
two
lower
courts
that
apply
existing
doctrine.
and
under
existing
doctrine,
only
if
we
discover
that
this
is
a
fundamental
right
do
i
have
to
justify--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
we
would
first
have
to
have
a
regulation
of
commerce
that's
discriminatory.
and
i
would
say
that
a
--
that
this
is
a
governmental
function.
i
would
say
that--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
statute
says
i
cannot
recoup
the
cost
of
maintaining
and
generating
the
database,
which
is
by
definition
overhead.
i
cannot--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--it's
an
added
burden,
too.
it's
not
all--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--they
do.
this
is
a--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--this
is
a
taxpayer
subsidized
system.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
the
--
there
is
a
burden
--
there
is
a
non-financial
burden
as
well,
because
as
one
who
is
subject
to
foia
requests,
we
have
a
finite
number
of
officials
and
employees
who
have
to
address
these
things.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
in
--
in
fact,
the
state
of
virginia
has
made
the
policy
decision
to
give
this
information
to
its
citizens,
and
not
to
inquire
behind
it
to
see
whether
or
not
somebody's
doing
it
for
an
out-of-stater.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
and
we
don't
--
and
we
don't
try.
we
have
a
policy
decision
that
we
want
to
have
a
very
simple
system
that
allows
our
citizens
to
make
inquiries
without
a
demonstrated
need
or
cause,
because
we
want
there
to
be
sunshine.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
the
thing
that
is
of
--
of
great
concern
--
why
do
we
care?
why
do
we
bother
--
is
the
principle
that
when
a
government
is
providing
a
taxpayer-subsidized
service
of
recent
origin
to
its
citizens,
that
it
does
not
have
to
explain
its
choice
either
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
or
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
it
is
very
important
that
we
not
find
ourselves
with
lawsuits
that
say
“
services
”.
voluntary
services
are
in
fact
things
that
now
have
to
be
justified
under
those
two
provisions
of
the
constitution.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
but
it's
very
difficult
for
mr.
hurlbert
to
make
that
fairly
expansive
argument,
because
it
turns
out--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--but
in
point
of
fact,
because
he
is
entitled
to
the
tax
assessment
data
in
the
clerk's
office,
in
the
case
of
henrico
county,
where
he
went,
you
go
in
the
same
building
and
--
if
you're
mr.
hurlbert,
you
turn
in
one
direction
and
go
to
the
clerk's
office.
and
if
somebody's
in
virginia
and
wants
to
--
for
whatever
reason
get
it
from
the
tax
assessor's
book
instead
of
from
the
clerk's
book,
you
turn
in
the
other
direction.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
have
no
idea
in
this
record,
because
we
were
on
summary
judgment
--
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment,
and
the
district
court
of
the
court
of
appeals
both
in
our
judgment
correctly
ruled
that
there's
a
two-step
inquiry.
and
the
first
step
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
fundamental
right.
and
in
the
absence
of
a
fundamental
right--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--if
--
if
in
fact
you
want
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
--
subject
it
to
attack,
obviously,
that
would
then
raise
questions
about
a
nongovernmental
protectionist
intent.
but
that's
not
the
way
this
statute
was
written.
it's
not
how
it
was
crafted,
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
commerce.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
right.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
would
have
about
three
answers
to
that.
the
first
one
is
that
we
don't
trigger
the
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis
unless
we
are
exercising
the
police
power
of
a
state
to
regulate
commerce.
and
that
means,
it
does
mean
that
not
every
statute
a
state
passes
triggers
an
inquiry,
even
if
it
has
an
indirect
effect
on
commerce.
whereas
here,
we
have
a
statute
that
has
a
solely
political
intent,
the
fact
that
now
the
amici
want
to
tell
us
about
this
great
burgeoning
enterprise,
they
want
the
court
to
take--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
am
totally
agnostic
on
this
record
because
we
don't
have
any
data
on
that.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
on
this
record
--
on
this
record
the
position
that
was
accepted
by
the
two
courts
below
entirely
in
accordance
with
this
court's
existing
doctrine
was
the
first
inquiry
under
privileges
and
immunities
was
whether
there
was
a
fundamental
right.
if
there
is
not
then
we
make
no
further
inquiry.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
under
this
record
that
never
came
up
nor
should
it
have
come
up,
because
what
the
court
said
on
dormant
commerce
clause,
both
of
the
courts
below,
was
this
was
not
a
regulation
of
commerce,
it
is
a
governmental
action--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
believe
you
are
correct.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
but
remember
they
do
have
access
to
this
information,
both
hurlbert
and
mcburney.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
here's
the
problem
in
this
case.
because
i
think
that
we
are
not
at
first-tier
analysis
because
there
is
no
regulation
of
commerce
that
is
discriminatory--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i'm
trying
to
explain
why
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
it
doesn't
matter
because
if,
on
the
threshold
inquiry,
we
don't
have
a
discriminatory
regulation
of
commerce
but
just
an
ordinary
governmental
function
than
only
pike-church
analysis
could
possibly--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
has
been
--
taxes
have
been
found
to
be
both
violations
of
privileges
and
immunities
and
dormant
commerce
clause
where
there
was
unequal
taxation
of
commerce.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
okay.
well--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
apologize
i
chose
a
word
that
is
not
as
apt
as
it
should
have
been,
but
a
regulation
or
taxation
centering
around
commerce
intended
to
affect
and
actually
affecting
commerce,
this
just
isn't
that
kind
of
activity.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
if
i
had
--
if
i
had
a
statute
which
on
its
face
dealt
with
commerce--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--i
would
be
saying
something
at
least
slightly
different
if
i
had
different
facts
that
i
had
to
deal
with,
but
i
think
in
principle
i
would
be
arguing
the
power
of
the
state
to
pass
this
kind
of
act
without
having
to
submit
to
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
at
least
first-tier
dormant
commerce
clause
analysis.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
well,
virginia
can
do
things
including
have
in-state
tuition.
it
can
have
--
it
can
subsidize
it's
own
businesses
either
by
training
programs
or
even
by
other
direct
subsidy
from
public
fisk.
it
limits
welfare
payments
to
residents
of
the
commonwealth.
when
the
commonwealth
is
just
acting
as
a
government
and
not
as
a
regulator
or
taxer
of
interstate
commerce,
it
has
the
status
of
a
coequal
sovereign
that
in
its
own
sphere
is
allowed
to
do
its
own
policy
choices.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
if
--
if
we
were
going
to
say,
if
you
were
going
to
say
that
this
is
an
inquiry
that
needs
to
be
made
under
the
commerce
clause,
this
would
be
a
particularly
poor
vehicle
for
doing
it,
because,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
pike
analysis
of
the
district
court
was
not
appealed,
and
therefore
this
case
could
not
be
sent
back
on
remand
to
develop
a
burden
analysis
of
a
record--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--well,
there's
--
there's
discrimination
only
in
the
sense
that
we
discriminate
against
people
who
we
don't
let
vote
because
they
don't
live
in
the
commonwealth
as
well.
i
mean,
we
--
this
statute
has
a
function.
it's
a
legitimate
function,
and--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--well,
i
would
say
that
--
that
whether
or
not
somebody
can
deal
with
an
item
in
commerce
is
--
is
--
raises
commerce
clause
questions.
and
just
like
in
reno
v.
condon,
where
the
state
of
south
carolina
was
choosing
to
take
its
records
and
sell
them
into
the
stream
of
commerce,
there
the
court
held
that
--
that
they
thereby
became
a
thing
in
commerce.
the
records
of
the
tax
assessor
of
the
county
of
henrico,
which
are
available
through
the
clerk's
office
to
mr.
hurlbert,
are
not
things
or
persons
in
commerce,
nor
are
they--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--but
they
are
available.
they
are
publicly
available.
they
are
not
just
not
available
through
this
adjunct
service.
all
--
all
foia
is,
is
a
device
where
you
don't
have
to
go
and
look.
there
has
always
been
public
access
for
these
--
these
records.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
--
i
think
there
that
--
that
the
important
policy
issue
in
this
case
for
us
is
precisely
as
you
articulated.
there
--
there
is
residual
sovereign
power
in
the
state
to
act,
and
we
have
to
violate
the
constitution,
clearly,
before
we
lose
that
authority.
and
under
existing
privileges
and
immunities
doctrine,
the
privileges
and
immunities
are
--
are
few;
they
are
--
they
have
been
enumerated
in
the
courts,
they
are
similar
in
character
having
to
do
with
commerce,
not
governmental
action.
so
i
would
say
you
would
not
extend
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
agree,
your
--
justice
scalia.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
i
am
--
i
am
arguing
that
--
of
course
i
think
we
say
in
our
brief
that
--
that
they
can
be
put
into
commerce.
they
are
put
into
commerce.
but
we
don't
put
them
into
commerce.
and
we
have
--
in
the
architecture
of
our
bill,
our
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
commerce.
and
if
a
state
can't
deal
with--
mr.
e.
duncan
getchell,
jr.
--because
it
is
not
an
exercise
of
the
state
police
power
to
regulate
commerce.
the
documents
in
the
--
in
the
tax
assessor's
office
of
the
county
of
henrico
are
not
things
or
persons
in
commerce,
nor
are
they
channels
or
instrumentalities
of
commerce.
they
are
just
the
records
of
the
sovereign,
which
we
will
allow
our
citizens
to
obtain.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
think
this
argument
has
been
developed
from
our
standpoint.
