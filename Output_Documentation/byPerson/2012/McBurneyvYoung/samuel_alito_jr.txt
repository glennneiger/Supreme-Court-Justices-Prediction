justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
a
provision
of
virginia's
freedom
of
information
act
that
provides
public
records
access
to
virginia's
citizens
but
not
to
citizens
of
other
states.
petitioners
who
are
citizens
of
california
and
rhode
island
filed
requests
under
the
act,
but
the
request
were
denied
because
of
their
citizenship.
they
then
brought
suit
contending
that
this
feature
of
the
virginia's
freedom
of
information
act
violates
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv
of
the
constitution
and
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
the
fourth
circuit
rejected
their
claims
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
with
the
third
circuit
which
is
held
that
delaware's
citizens
only
foia
provision
violates
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
we
hold
that
petitioners'
constitutional
claims
were
properly
rejected.
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
prohibits
the
state
from
denying
to
citizens
of
other
states
those
fundamental
privileges
and
immunities
that
are
extended
to
the
state's
own
citizens.
petitioners
alleged
that
virginia's
freedom
of
information
act
bridges
four
fundamental
privileges
or
immunities
the
right
to
pursue
a
common
calling,
the
right
to
own
and
transfer
property
in
virginia,
the
right
to
access
public
proceedings,
and
a
broad
right
to
obtain
public
information.
the
first
three
of
these
privileges,
however,
are
not
actually
abridged
by
the
virginia
law
and
the
fourth,
at
least,
in
the
broad
sense,
framed
by
petitioners
is
not
fundamental.
in
addition
to
his
privileges
and
immunities
claim,
petitioner
hurlbert
contends
that
virginia's
freedom
of
information
act
violates
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
but
the
virginia
law
neither
regulates
in
a
more
burdens
commerce.
it
simply
provides
a
service
to
virginia
citizens.
for
these
and
other
reasons
set
out
in
our
opinion,
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
affirmed.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
