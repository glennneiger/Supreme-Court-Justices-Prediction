chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
first
in
case
12-357,
sekhar
v.
united
states.
mr.
clement?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
why
isn't
that
--
you
focused
on
transferability
when
you
began.
why
isn't
that
completely
transferable?
i
have
leverage
against
this
official
and
if
you
want
him
to
recommend
yes
on
your
investment,
you
have
to
pay
me
a
certain
amount
of
money.
and
you
can
transfer
that.
you've
got
everybody
in,
say,
you
know,
the
association
or
whatever
and
you
can
auction
that
off.
it
seems
to
me
it's
perfectly
transferable
from
the
defendant
to
anyone
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
the
lawyer's
going
to
make
recommendations
in
many
other
cases
as
well.
and
if
you
have
an
application
coming
up
and
you
want
a
favorable
recommendation,
you
can
go
to
the
--
the
individual
that
has
the
leverage
and
say,
i
will
pay
you
this
much
money
if
you
can
get
the
person
to
give
me
a
favorable
recommendation.
and
that's
transferable
from
the
person
with
the
--
the
leverage
to
--
to
someone
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
harrington.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
--
you
point
out,
of
course,
that
it
was
based
on
the
new
york
law,
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
point
that
they
did
not
carry
forward
the
separate
crime
of
coercion,
which
was
in
the
new
york
law
but
not
in
the
hobbs
act?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
do
you
do
with
the
fact
that
the
state
authorities
did
charge
it
under
coercion?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
you
could
characterize
the
right
to
work
as
more
of
a
liberty
interest
than
a
property
interest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
draw
a
distinction
between
extorting
someone
not
to
go
to
work
and
extorting
him
how
to
do
his
job
once
he's
at
work?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
clement,
5
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-357,
sekhar
versus
united
states.
