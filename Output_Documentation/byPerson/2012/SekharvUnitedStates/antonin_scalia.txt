justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
what
the
word
“
extort
”
means?
you
extort
something
from
someone?
it
means
you
get
it
from
him,
you
don't
get
it
from
some
third
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
person
coerced
here
was
a
--
was
a
corrupt
person
and
had
put
his
recommendation
out
for
bids.
okay?
he
said,
you
know,
i'll
--
i'll
recommend
whoever
pays
me
the
most
money.
would
that
alter
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
--
if
then
somebody
comes
in
and
says,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
you
the
money,
but
i'll
--
i'll
break
your
knees
if
you
don't
recommend
me,
would
that
be
extortion?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
is
--
i
have
a
property
interest
in
doing
my
job?
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
i
mean,
just
throwing
words
around.
you
are
calling
doing
a
job
a
property
interest.
normally
when
i
think
of
property,
i
think
of
something
that
can
be
conveyed.
can
i
convey
the
--
the
doing
of
my
job
to
somebody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i'm
not
talking
about
my
labor.
i'm
talking
about
my
doing
the
job
that
the
employer
has
assigned
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
my
--
not
my
labor
in
the
abstract.
nobody
is
taking
my
labor
away
from
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
cite
me
one
--
one
extortion
case
at
common
law
--
or
let
me
put
it
another
way.
what
is
the
closest
extortion
case
at
common
law
that
you
can
allude
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
--
we
are
using
a
common
law
term
here,
“
extortion
”.
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever.
what's
the
closest
that
comes
to
this
abstract
"the
doing
of
my
job
is
property?
"
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what's
the
closest
new
york
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
--
that's
the
problem
with
your
new
york
cases
as
well.
you
--
you
are
focusing
on
property
in
another
context,
where
the
property
is
harmed,
not
whether
property
is
taken.
you
--
you
have
neither
a
new
york
case
nor
any
other
common
law
case
involving
extortion
where
the
property
taken
consists
of
somebody's
doing
his
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
obtainable
property
and
--
and
harmable
property
are
one
and
the
same
thing,
i'm
really
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
--
you
are
contradicting
what
you
yourself
said
a
little
bit
before,
which
is
that
property
means
the
same
thing
for
both
provisions--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
both
the
obtaining
and
the
harming.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
mean
the
same
thing
for
the
harming,
because
there
is
some
property
that
can't
be
harmed.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
valuable
to
me?
why
is
it
valuable
to
me
--
i
can
see
how
the
job
is
valuable
to
me.
i
get
paid
to
do
the
job.
but
why
making
one
recommendation
rather
than
another
is
valuable
to
me?
i
don't
think
it's
valuable
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
because
i'm
an
honest
person
that
i
want
to
make
the
proper
recommendation,
but
to
say
that
it
has
any
economic
value
that
i
recommend
a
rather
than
b?
it's
--
it's
totally
neutral
whether
one
is
--
is
more
economically
valuable
than
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
very
true
and
an
honest
lawyer
should
do
that,
but
that
doesn't
prove
that
it's
economically
valuable
for
the
lawyer
to
give
the
right
advice
rather
than
the
wrong
advice.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
that
one
of
the
choices
the
jury
had?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
obtaining
of
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
true.
not
the
obtaining
the
property,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
think
would
be
covered
by
coercion
that
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
government's
extortion
theory
here?
give
me
an
example
of
--
of
coercion?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
for
example--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
--
why
isn't
that
property?
why.
you
know,
my
--
my
choice
of
marrying
whom
i
want,
why
isn't
that
as
much
property
as
--
as
my
ability
to
--
to
perform
my
job
the
way
i
want?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
people
marry
for
money.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
--
it
at
least
makes
available
the
argument
that
you
don't
have
to
go
this
far,
that
there
are
other
provisions
that
would
enable
you
to
get
to
this
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
--
instead
of
inducing
us
to
define
property
so
broadly
that
it's
unrecognizable,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we're
talking
about
property
for
purposes
of
extortion,
the
common
law
crime
of
extortion.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
property
is
property.
i
think
property
can
--
can
have
a
--
a
different
meaning
with
--
with
regard
to
various
provisions
of
the
law.
and
--
and
the
provision
of
the
law
defining
extortion
brings
with
it
a
whole
baggage
of
--
of
common
law
cases.
and
that
may
well
be
different
from
the
word
“
property
”
used
in
some
other
federal
statute
that
does
not
invoke
the
common
law
of
extortion.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry
about
that
but
this
is
shorter.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
new
york's
common
retirement
fund
is
an
employee
pension
fund
for
the
state
of
new
york
and
its
local
governments.
in
october
2009,
the
state
comptroller's
office
was
considering
whether
to
invest
in
a
fund
managed
by
fa
technology
ventures.
the
general
counsel
of
the
office
recommended
against
the
investment.
the
general
counsel
then
received
anonymous
e-mails
demanding
that
he
recommend
in
favor
of
the
investment
and
threatening,
if
he
did
not,
to
disclose
publicly
information
about
an
alleged
extramarital
affair
he
was
having.
the
e-mails
were
traced
to
petitioner,
a
managing
partner
of
fa
technology
ventures.
petitioner
was
then
convicted
of
attempted
extortion
in
violation
of
the
hobbs
act,
which
defines
extortion
to
mean,
this
definition
is
crucial,
“the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
induced
by
wrongful
use
of
actual
or
threatened
force,
violence,
or
fear.”
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction.
it
held
that
the
general
counsel
had
a
property
right
to
make
a
recommendation
free
from
threats
and
that
petitioner
sought
to
obtain
that
right
by
attempting
to
force
to
general
counsel
to
make
a
different
recommendation.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
reverse.
absent
other
indication,
congress
intends
to
incorporate
the
well-settled
meaning
of
the
common-law
terms
that
it
uses
in
it
statutes.
extortion
is
one
of
the
oldest
crimes
in
our
legal
tradition.
yet
no
case
preceding
the
hobbs
act
ever
identified
conduct
such
as
that
charged
here
as
extortion.
the
text
of
the
act
confirms
that
obtaining
property
requires
“not
only
the
deprivation
but
also
the
acquisition
of
property.”
the
property
extorted
must
therefore
be
transferable
--
that
is,
capable
of
passing
from
one
person
to
another.
the
alleged
property
here
lacks
that
defining
feature.
the
genesis
of
the
hobbs
act
reinforces
this
conclusion.
congress
borrowed
nearly
verbatim
the
definition
of
extortion
from
a
1909
new
york
statute
but
did
not
copy
the
coercion
provision
contained
in
that
statute.
at
the
time
of
the
borrowing,
new
york
courts
had
consistently
held
that
the
sort
of
interference
with
rights
that
occurred
here
was
extortion
--
i'm
sorry
was
coercion.
wow,
i
almost
blew
that
one.
in
support
of
the
conviction,
the
government
urges
--
argues
that
the
petitioner
sought
to
obtain
the
general
counsel's
property
right,
but
no
fluent
speaker
of
english
would
say
that
“petitioner
obtained
and
exercised
the
general
counsel's
right
to
make
a
recommendation”,
any
more
than
he
would
say
that
a
person
“obtained
and
exercised
another's
right
to
free
speech.”
he
would
say
that
“petitioner
forced
the
general
council
to
make
a
particular
recommendation,”
just
as
he
would
say
that
a
person
“forced
another
to
make
a
particular
statement.”
adapting
the
government's
theory
would
not
only
make
nonsense
of
words;
it
would
collapse
the
longstanding
distinction
between
extortion
and
coercion
and
would
ignore
congress'
choice
to
penalize
one
but
not
the
other.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
alito
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
kennedy
and
sotomayor
have
joined.
