justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
jury
had
--
had
returned
the
verdict
which
is
at
ja142,
and
it
had
marked
that
the
attempt
to
extort
was
to
extort
the
commitment,
you
might
still
maybe
have
some
causation
arguments,
but
i
assume
the
property
argument
you're
about
to
make
is
just
irrelevant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
--
could
the
case
have
been
indicted
--
has
it
been
charged
as
one
in
which
what
they
were
taking
was
the
commissions
that
would
ultimately
have
been
generated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
here,
what
the
petitioner
wanted
were
the
commissions,
ultimately.
and
you
can't
commit
extortion
in
order
to
get
--
and
that's
real
money.
it's
for
the
government
to
answer,
not
you,
but
can
--
do
you
have
any
idea
why
they
didn't
charge
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
took
you
away
from
your
argument
about
intangible
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
let
me
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
position.
suppose
roughly
these
facts:
the
general
counsel
is
threatened
with
something
very
serious,
let's
say
violence,
unless
he
makes
a
favorable
recommendation.
he
does.
they
act
on
that
recommendation,
it's
--
it's
a
substantial
cause
in
making
the
investment,
and
the
investment
is
made
and
they
get
the
money.
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
--
but
that's
a
causation
argument,
not
whether
or
not
you
received
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
so
far
as
the
property
point
in
my
hypothetical,
if
the
recommendation
leads
to
the
contract
and
the
contract
leads
to
the
commission
and
the
commission
means
money
in
your
pocket,
that's
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
then
we
just
have
a
causation
argument,
not
a
property
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
add
to
justice
breyer's
question,
it's
--
suppose
the
secretary/typist
is
--
the
stenographer
is
charged
with
typing
the
letter
“
i
do
not
recommend
”
and
they
bribe
her
and
she
says
“
i
recommend
”.
she
has
an
interest
in
her
integrity
to
give
an
honest
transcription.
under
your
view,
and
this
is
what
justice
breyer
is
getting
at,
i
think,
that
--
that
secretary
has
property
that
you
are
taking.
that's
very
far-reaching.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
--
it
does
seem
to
me
important
that
you
can't
give
us
a
common
law
case
because
common
law
is
extortion
--
at
common
law
is
extortion,
it's
usually
the
other
way
around.
it's
usually
the
official
who's
doing
the
extorting.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
--
at
common
law,
could
anyone
ever
extort
an
official,
or
we
just
don't
have
those
cases?
