mr.
clement--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
clement,
just
along
the
same
lines.
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
still
would
not
be
extortion
--
let's
say
somebody
in
your
client's
position
runs
an
investment
company,
wants
an
investment,
wants
the
fees
that
come
along
with
that
investment.
goes
to
--
let's
say
that
there's
a
single
person
who
gets
to
decide
whether
to
make
that
investment,
and
so
to
pay
those
fees,
goes
to
that
person,
threatens
that
person
with
something
terrible
happening
to
him.
you're
saying
that
that
does
not
count
as
extortion,
that
there's
a
reason
that
the
government
didn't
charge
it
like
that?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
they
want
the
investment
with
--
and
the
fees
that
come
with
the
investment.
so
--
and
that's
why
they're
threatening
the
person.
justice
elena
kagan
even
--
even
though
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
investment
and
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
fees
absent
the
--
the
threat
of
force
or
--
or
violence?
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
you
think
the
commitment
is
real
cash,
is
a
real
contract,
real
cash,
real
property,
right,
then
it
wouldn't
matter
under
that
--
under
what
you
just
said,
that
the
threat
was
made
to
the
general
counsel
rather
than
to
the
final
person
who
issued
the
money,
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
right.
but
you
wouldn't
say,
well,
we're
dealing
with
an
organization,
so
it's
only
extortion
if
you
threaten
the
person
who
writes
the
check?
justice
elena
kagan
if
you
threaten
the
person
who
makes
a
recommendation
to
the
person
who
writes
the
check,
that's
good
enough.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
harrington,
just
to
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
--
i
mean,
suppose
--
was
there
a
reason
why
it
wasn't
charged
in
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
simpler
way,
which
is
a
threat
was
made
in
order
to
get
an
investment
and
in
order
to
get
fees
to
put
in
your
pocket
and
--
and
go
away
with,
and
that's
extortion.
so
why
wasn't
it
--
why
wasn't
that
the
theory
of
the
case?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
there's
an
obstacle
to
charging
a
case
that
way?
mr.
clement
seems
to
think
that
there's
an
obstacle,
that
even
though
there's
property
in
that
case,
there's
some
other
problem
with
charging
the
case
that
way.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
harrington,
go
back
to
the
scheidler
example,
because
that
was
a
case
where
we
said
there
was
not
extortion
when
there
were
threats
of
violence
meant
to
close
down
an
abortion
clinic's
operations.
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
if
those
threats
of
violence
had
been
targeted
at
the
abortion
clinic's
lawyer
in
order
to
get
him
to
tell
the
clinic
to
shut
down
their
operations
because
they
were
a
violation
of
law,
that
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
now,
how
could
that
be?
justice
elena
kagan
so
--
so
you
think
if
--
if
they
targeted
the
--
the
clinic's
lawyer
or
the
--
if
the
threats
were,
don't
shut
down
the
clinic;
instead,
start
delivering
babies,
that
that
would
be
extortion,
whereas
in
the
real
case
it
wasn't?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
because
there
wasn't
--
and
there's
nothing
obtained
either
way.
i
mean,
you
are
trying
to
change
what
the
person
is
doing,
but
you
are
not
getting
anything
from
it.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
yes,
he
would
have
ended
up
with
something
intangible
in
those
hypotheticals.
he
would
have
ended
up
with
the
mowed
lawn.
he
would
have
ended
up
with
the
thing
that
the
service
was
providing
them.
justice
elena
kagan
the
--
the
problem
here
is
that
there
is
no
obtaining
of
anything
that
the
person
is
getting
from
your
theory.
justice
elena
kagan
ms.
harrington,
i
guess
i'm
just
confused,
and
this
goes
back
again
to
justice
kennedy's
initial
question,
why
it
wasn't
charged
in
a
much
simpler
way
where
the
property
is
not
a
right
by
a
lawyer
to
do
his
job,
which
seems
no
other
person
can
get,
but
where
the
property
was
the
contract,
was
the
--
was
the
investment
and
the
fees,
and
the
theory
was
that
a
threat
was
used
in
order
to
get
that
investment
and
fees.
and
why
wasn't
--
why
isn't
that
just
--
you
know,
i
look
at
the
facts
here
and
i
say
extortion,
but
not
on
your
theory,
on
my
theory.
and
why
wasn't
that
simple
theory
used?
justice
elena
kagan
but
you
don't
think
that
there's
any
reason
why
it,
in
a
future
case,
it
couldn't
be
charged
just
the
way
i
said
it?
