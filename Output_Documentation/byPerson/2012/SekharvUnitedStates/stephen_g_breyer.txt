justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
--
what
about
the
mob
goes
to
a
grocer
and
says,
you
know,
you're
dead
or
something
if
you
sell
cheerios,
and
the
reason
is
because
they
have
a
monopoly,
some
other
grocery
who's
connected
has
a
monopoly.
and
they
threaten
him.
now,
does
that
violate
hobbs
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
he
did
was
--
and
he's
--
he's
not
going
to
sell
cheerios.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
--
now,
in
fact,
they're
doing
it
to
get
money,
and
they
do
get
money,
but
via
the
means
of
the
other
grocer.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
words
of
this
act
that
says
that
the
property
has
to
be
taken
from
the
individual
whom
you
coerce.
it's
easy
to
imagine
situations
where
the
coerced
individual
has
a
relationship,
direct,
special
and
so
forth,
with
the
person
who
has
the
money.
so
what
happens
when,
say,
the
mob
coerces
the
person
without
the
property
so
that
he
will
do
a
thing
such
that
the
person
with
the
property
gives
them
the
property?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now
just
make
it
different.
what
they
do
is
they
get
the
assistant
bank
employee
and
they
threaten
him
to
do
such
a
thing
such
as
shout
at
a
certain
time
where
they
know
that
that
shouting
will
lead
them
to
be
able
to
rob
the
bank.
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
easy
to
think
up.
what
i
can't
figure
out
here
is,
is
there
some
requirement
that
the
person
who
is
coerced
has
to
be
the
same
person
as
the
person
who
gives
them
the
property.
if
the
answer
to
that's
no,
then
none
of
the
government's
chamber
of
horribles
is
horrible,
because
there's
a
way
around
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
haven't
found
anything
on
this.
you'd
be
making
it
up
now,
is
that
basically
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
--
is
the
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
to
be
more
property,
more
money,
more
money
in
return
for
less
services
or
something
than
otherwise.
that's
what
you're
saying.
but
i
don't
think
that's
--
i
mean,
right.
but
the
answer
--
go
ahead,
because
i
--
that's
the
qualification
you're
making,
the
mcnally
qualification.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
obvious
problem,
which
you
might
want
to
address
at
some
point,
is
that
--
that
if
you
take
your
definition
that
this
recommendation,
legal
recommendation,
is
property
and
the
fellow
said,
you
know,
i'm
going
to
fix
you
if
you
don't
do
it,
if
that's
property,
we're
back
to
the
honest
services
statute,
because
anyone
in
government
and
anyone
in
business,
indeed
everybody,
has
a
job
and
those
jobs
always
require
you
to
do
things.
so
if
every
time
somebody
threatens
a
person
and
says,
we
don't
want
you
to
do
the
thing
you're
supposed
to
do,
we
want
you
to
do
the
thing
like
this,
well,
then
you're
violating
this
property
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
seems
very
far-reaching,
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
abortion
case
--
the
abortion
clinic
case,
etcetera,
and
it
is
easy
to
reconcile
with
the
honest
services
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
that
sounds
technical.
you
see,
the
problem
i'm
interested
in
is,
by
accepting
your
definition
do
we
suddenly
throw
within
the
statute,
which
speaks
of
property,
any
time
there
is
an
appropriate
threat
which
has
as
a
condition
the
person
doing
the
job
differently?
that's
true
of
whether
it's
a
postman,
you
know,
any
public
official,
any
private
official,
anybody.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
seems
very
far-reaching.
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
i
understand
that.
but
i
still
would
like
an
answer
to
my
question,
and
it's
well-phrased
with
an
example
by
justice
kennedy.
every
secretary
in
the
united
states
who
is
about
to
write
a
recommendation
for
somebody
to
go
to
college
or
some
other
thing
then
is
faced
with
a
threat,
you
put
in
name
such-and-such
or
put
in
yes
instead
of
no,
and
is
under
your
definition
that
person's
property,
that
what
she
does
the
taking
of
property?
the
answer
is
either
you
think
yes,
in
which
case
i
would
like
you
to
defend
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
the
--
yes.
okay.
then
what
conceivable
ground?
i'm
not
--
i
don't
want
to
--
that
sounds
a
little
pejorative,
but
i'll
say:
what
ground
is
there
for
a
definition
that
is
so
broad
that
it
sweeps
within
it
all
working
people
in
the
united
states
in
the
performance
of
their
ordinary
jobs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
think
about
it
in
terms
of
the
new
york
cases,
as
you
write
them
up
here,
it
sounds
as
if
someone
was
trying
to
get
control
of
a
business.
so
i
think
business,
land,
labor,
and
capital.
all
right.
i
can
see
why
somebody
who's
trying
to
get
control
of
a
whole
business
is
trying
to
take
land,
labor
and
capital.
there
may
be
no
land
there,
but
so
what.
and
--
but
a
person's
trying
to
take
control
of
another's
job
by
just
telling
him
what
to
do
2
percent
of
the
time
seems
well
across
some
kind
of
line.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
no
attaining
question.
i'm
just
thinking
is
it
reasonable
to
call
a
secretary
doing
one
job
which
takes
3
percent
of
her
time
that
hour
property,
in
a
way
is
that
different
from
taking
control
of
macy's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
probably
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i'm
not
worried
about
copyrights
or
other
intangibles.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
the
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why,
just
as
long
as
we
are
idly
speculating,
didn't
you
use
18
u.s.c.
875,
"whoever
with
intent
to
extort
from
any
person
anything
of
value?
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
--
you
don't
have
property
in
there.
you
have
a
thing
of
value--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
some
--
i
mean,
it
just
seems
obvious
you'd
be
in
a
much
stronger
position
when
you
say
that
the
recommendation
not
to
buy
or
to
buy
a
particular
service
from
somebody
is
a
thing
of
value.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
they
in
the
court
been
treated
as
a
thing
of
value
means
property?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
no.
