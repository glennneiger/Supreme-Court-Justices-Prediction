mr.
paul
d.
clement
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
crime
of
extortion
under
the
hobbs
act,
like
the
related
crimes
of
larceny,
burglary
and
embezzlement,
is
at
bottom
a
property
crime.
accordingly,
understanding
the
scope
of
obtainable
property
under
the
hobbs
act
is
critical
to
deciding
the
scope
of
the
basic
criminal
prohibition.
the
government
has
offered
you
a
definition
of
property
that
only
a
prosecutor
could
love:
any
intangible
right
with
economic
value,
but
that
definition
is
fundamentally
incompatible
with
this
court's
precedence
and
with
congress's
conscious
decision
in
the
hobbs
act
to
criminalize
the
state
--
new
york
state
crime
of
extortion,
but
not
the
new
york
crime
of
coercion.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant,
justice
kennedy.
i
would
have
a
different
argument.
i
think
that
i
would
stand
first
and
foremost
on
this
court's
decision
in
cleveland,
where
it
recognized
that
something
like,
i
think
the
commitment,
certainly
the
video
poker
license
was
at
issue
there,
the
court
also
referenced
an
unissued
patent.
and
it
recognized
that
there
are
things
that
have
value
once
they're
issued,
but
in
the
hands
of
the
government,
they
don't
have
value,
and
therefore
don't
qualify
as
property.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
justice
kennedy,
it
might
have
been
possible
to
say
that
what
was
obtained
here
was
money,
but
i
think
if
the
government
had
prosecuted
it
under
that
theory,
it
would
have
to
prove
that
somehow
the
government
paid
too
much.
i
don't
think
it
can
point
just
to
the
commissions.
and
i
would
analogize
it
to
the
mcnally
case.
in
the
mcnally
case,
you
know,
there
was
this
scheme
in
which
various
sort
of
friends
of
government
officials
were
getting
the
commissions
from
a
workmen's
compensation
policy.
and
what
this
court
said
is,
well,
it
would
have
been
one
thing
if
the
government
had
come
in
and
said
that
the
government
paid
commissions
that
were
too
high,
or
the
government
had
received
inferior
quality
insurance.
but
what
the
government
did
there
instead
was
sort
of
take
the
shortcut
and
plead
that
what
had
happened
is,
the
government
had
been
deprived
of
its
interest
in
having
the
honest
services--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
i
think
the
reason
that
they
didn't
charge
that
is
probably
practically
twofold.
one
is
that
a
commitment
under
new
york
law
and
practice
is
not
quite
as
what
it
sounds;
it's
not
really
a
commitment.
and
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
with
the
last
fund
for
this
particular
management
company,
they
got
a
commitment
from
the
state
and
there
was
no
ultimate
investment
made.
so
there's
a
subsequent
step
down
the
road.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
so
i
think
that's
part
of
it.
the
other
thing
i
would
say
is
as
in
mcnally,
i
think
they
would
have
had
to
prove
that
the
management
fees
were
somehow
excessive
or
something
like
that,
so
they
didn't
do
that.
they
focused
on
this
recommendation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
say
that
that
--
i
would
say
a
couple
of
things.
i
would
say
that's
a
harder
case
than
the
one
i
have
before
you
today.
i
would
say
that
i
don't
think
that's
actually
extortion
if
what
they
charge
is
the
commitment,
not
the
money
that
goes
--
that
flows
from
the
government.
and
then
what
i
would
say
--
and
the
reason
i
would
say
that
is
because
of
cleveland.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
and
i
would
say
that
under
mcnally,
in
that
kind
of
case,
what
the
government
has
to
prove
is
that
if
they
want
to
make
the
property
the
money
interest
that
the
government
is
paying
out
and
the
person
is
obtaining,
they
have
to
show
that
there's
some
sort
of
excessive
commission
or
excessive
sort
of
management
fee.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
again,
that
would
be
my
position.
and
i
think
it
would
follow
from
this
court's
decisions
in
cases
like
cleveland
and
mcnally,
because
in
mcnally,
of
course,
the
people
who
were
part
of
that
fraudulent
scheme,
they
were
getting
commissions
from
the
workmen
comp
program.
and
the
government's
theory
was
that
just
interfering
with
the
government's
decision
about
who
to
give
the
workmen
--
where
to
place
the
workmen's
comp
policies
was
enough
of
an
interference
to
support
a
fraud
conviction.
and
this
court
said
no.
and
one
of
the
things
it
then
said
is
well,
it
would
be
different
if
--
if
the
government
went
in
and
proved
that
the
commissions
that
were
paid
were
too
high,
or
that
the
government
somehow
got
inadequate
insurance.
but
if
all
they're
doing
is
saying
that
what's
going
on
here
is
sort
of
the
interest
of
the
government
in
having
its
employees
serve
them
honestly
and
in
their
best
interest,
and
not
in
some
third
party's
best
interest,
that
brings
you
squarely
into
honest
services.
and
nobody's
saying
that
doing
that's
a
good
thing,
but
it's
--
it's
the
traditional
office
of
the
state
law
crime
of
coercion.
it's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
this
was
charged
by
new
york
state
authorities
as
coercion.
so
the
very
crime
that
congress
didn't
incorporate
into
the
hobbs
act,
the
new
york
crime
of
coercion,
was
charged
here,
and
it's
my
understanding
that
the
new
york
crime
of
coercion,
like
the
earlier
version
of
coercion
in
the
racketeer
--
in
the
anti-racketeering
act
of
1934,
like
the
traditional
model
penal
code
definition
of
coercion
--
it's
the
--
the
threat
part
of
it
is
the
same
as
extortion.
so
it
covers
a
threat
to
a
person
or
to
property.
and
it's
been
interpreted
certainly
to
include
threats
to
disclose
information
like
this.
so
i
think
the
real
difference
between
the
crime
of
extortion
and
the
crime
of
coercion,
both
as
a
general
matter
and
under
new
york
law,
is
whether
or
not
property
is
obtained.
and
that's
ultimately
what's
so
problematic
about
the
government's
definition
here,
because
their
definition
is
essentially
the
property
includes
the
autonomy
interest
of
a
business
to
operate
free
from
coercion.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
would
say
that
for
property
to
come
within
the
terms
of
the
hobbs
act
prohibition
on
obtaining
property,
it
has
to
be
alienable,
transferable,
moveable.
that's
the
critical
thing.
so
the
distinction
is
not
between
alienable
and
inalienable.
a
patent
is
an
inalienable
--
i
mean,
rather,
a
patent
is
an
intangible
property
right,
but
it's
transferable,
it's
obtainable,
it
is
sellable,
and
so
it
has
the
characteristics
of
things
that
i
think
come
within
the
traditional
definition.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--right.
i
--
i
would
say
that
that
hypothetical
that
you've
given
me
would
be
coercion;
it
would
not
be
extortion
under
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think,
at
least
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
where
the
relationship
between
the
two
parties,
basically
the
competitors,
i
would
say
that
that's
two
distinct
relationships.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
it
is,
it
depends.
i
don't
think
i
can
give
you
a
definitive
that
the--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
what
--
what
i
would
tell
you
is
i
think
the
assumption
of
most
of
the
cases
is
that
the
person
that
is
the
pressure
of--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--is
the
person
who's
offering
up
the
property.
this
court's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
think
that's
basically
right,
justice
scalia.
what
i
would
say,
though,
is
i
think
there's
an
exception
to
the
--
at
least
to
the
following
extent,
which
i
think
it
would
be
open
to
the
government,
to
basically
say
that
within
an
entity,
if
you
sort
of
put
the
pressure
on
one
agent
of
the
corporation
and
you
actually
get
the
money
from
another
agent
of
the
same
corporation,
that
that's
probably
close
enough.
and
so
in
this
case,
if
the
pressure
was
put
on
a
particular
individual
and
they
obtained
like
actual
cash
from
the
government,
that
might
be
a
different
case.
but,
of
course,
here
what
they
received
was
this
commitment,
which
i
think
is
analogous
to
the
video
poker
license
in
the
cleveland
case,
so
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
--
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
kagan,
but
i
think
that's
because
they're
all
sort
of
agents
to
the
same
principal.
and
i'm
not
sure
you
get
all
the
way
to
what
justice
breyer
was
suggesting,
which
you
can
sort
of
run
it
through
competitors
or
something
like
that.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
no.
i--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--exactly,
your
honor.
but
what
i
would
also
say
is,
you
know,
this
is
a
real
case
and
there
are
real
jury
findings,
and
as
justice
kennedy
alluded
to,
there
were
a
variety
of
theories
of
property
put
in
front
of
the
jury.
they
were
invited
to
circle
as
many
of
them
as
they
could,
as
many
as
they
found
satisfied,
and
the
only
one
they
circled
was
the
recommendation.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--justice
sotomayor,
i'm
happy
to
have
you
rule
in
favor
of
my
client
on
“
obtained
”
or
“
property
”
and,
as
scheidler
ii
demonstrates,
those
terms
are
really
kind
of
married
together.
and
i
guess
the
reason
i
sort
of
think
that
the
“
obtained
”
and
the
“
property
”
should
be
construed
together
is
twofold.
one,
structurally
that's
what
the
statute
does.
so
when
you're
talking
about
in
the
statute
property
that
can
be
obtained,
i
think
that's
a
clue
that
you're
not
talking
about
property
in
its
broadest
manifestation.
and
you
contrast
that
with,
say,
the
clayton
act
that
talks
about
disjunctively
property
and
--
or
property
rights,
and
there
you
have
a
clue
that
congress
means
a
very
broad
conception.
when
it's
talking
about
it
in
conjunction
with
“
obtained
”,
i
think
it
has
a
narrower
ambit
in
mind.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
what
i
would
say
is
obtaining,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
scheidler
ii,
is
not
some
metaphysical
obtaining.
i
mean,
the
argument
was
made
to
this
court
that
the
abortion
protesters
obtained
the
autonomy
interest
of
the
business
in
--
the
clinics,
in
deciding
whether
--
who
to
serve
and
when
to
serve
and
when
to
be
open
and
when
to
be
closed.
and
this
court
said
no,
and
it
said
principally
that
that's
not
obtaining,
but
it's
--
but
it
also
noted,
i
guess
you'd
call
it
dictum,
that
what
--
what
--
obviously,
what
the
hobbs
act,
based
on
its
common
law
roots
in
extortion,
is
talking
about
is
the
kind
of
property
that
can
be
deprived,
it
can
then
be
transferred,
sold,
exercised.
and
i
do
think.
just
to
get
the
second
part
of
my
answer
out
if
i
could,
it's
just
--
the
common
law
roots
here
are
also
where
you
see
the
definition
of
property
can't
be
as
broad
as
the
government
suggests.
because
extortion
is
one
of
the
classic
common
law
property
crimes.
the
definition
of
property
for
purposes
of
extortion
ought
to
be
the
same
as
the
definition
of
property
for
larceny,
embezzlement,
burglary.
you
can't
go
into
somebody's
house
and
steal
their
honest
services
or
their
autonomy
interests.
so
the
kind
of
property
you
can
obtain
for
purposes
of
the
hobbs
act
is
that
same
kind
of
alienable,
transferable,
moveable
property.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
don't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--it
would
not,
justice
scalia,
and
i
would
say
because
--
the
state
of
louisiana
in
the
cleveland
case,
if
there
was
a
corrupt
official
who
was
putting
those
video
poker
licenses
on
sale
on
the
on
the
sly,
i
don't
think
that
would
change
the
result
there.
this
court
said
that
those
kind
of
government
things
do
not
have
value
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
the
fact
that
somebody,
you
know,
could
sort
of
be
corrupt
and
therefore
have
a
little
auction
on
the
side
i
don't
think
changes
that
basic
fact.
i
would
say,
too,
that
there's
an
important
difference
here
between
a
hypothetical
case
where
what
somebody's
trying
to
do
is
kind
of
get
something
for
nothing
and
essentially
get
the
benefit
of
the
work
of
a
government
official.
but
that's
not
what's
at
issue
here.
this
is
not
a
client
who's
trying
to
get
--
like,
you
know,
they
wanted
an
opinion
on
how
to
incorporate
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
they
thought,
well,
the
lawyers
are
kind
of
expensive
in
the
private
sector,
so
i'm
just
going
to
coerce
it
from
this
government
official.
all
they
care
about
in
this
case
is
the
bottom
line,
thumbs
up,
thumbs
down
recommendation.
i
don't
think
this
case
would
be
any
different
if
there
were
an
investment
committee
within
the
state
government
and
you
had
to
get
unanimous
assent
to
an
investment
and
there
was
one
holdout.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
now,
there
are
some
voting
rights
that
are
transferable
in
that
sense.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
stock
--
a
proxy
in
a
stock,
or
something
like
that,
that
may
well
come
within
the
definition.
but
when
you
have
these
essentially
voting
or
autonomy
interests
that
are
really
--
you
know,
they're
--
they're
sort
of
inherently
inalienable,
because
this
recommendation
matters
because
it's
the
general
counsel
and
the
comptroller's
office
recommendation.
and--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
the
confident
--
i
may
not
be
understanding
the
hypothetical.
certainly,
the
confidential
information
that
the
potential
coercer
has
may
be
transferable,
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
carpenter,
that
may
be
property.
but
the
voting
right
within
the
state
government
or
the
role
within
the
state
government's
internal
deliberative
process,
that
really
belongs
to
the
general
counsel,
and
he
can't--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--i
would
say
no,
but
i
would
say
it's
a
much
more
difficult
case.
and
the
reason
i
would
say
no
is
because
the
government
--
or
i'd
say
potentially
no.
i
would
still
say
that
the
government
has
to
prove
something
more,
which
is
that
it's
an
investment
where
there
either
was
not
the
optimal
investment
or
they
paid
too
high
a
commission.
and
--
and
i
take
that
from
mcnally.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right,
because
--
but
my
point
is
simply
that
if
the
government--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--yes.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
i
think
that's
right.
if
what's
obtained
is
money,
and
that's
what
the
government
focuses
its
prosecution
on,
then
that
is
--
that
satisfies
the
property
requirement
of
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
right,
exactly.
exactly,
exactly.
so
you
obtained
the
property,
so
that
box
is
checked,
but
the
--
sorry.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
say
that
what
you've
just
articulated
is
exactly
the
government's
theory,
and
the
problem
is
that
i
can
use
that
same
theory
to
take
any
autonomy
interest
and
turn
it
into
property
that
can
be
exercised,
it
can
be
obtained
by
somebody
and
then
exercised
by
them
in
a
way
different
from
the
way
that
the
person
would
otherwise
exercise
it.
and
whatever
--
i
mean,
you
know,
we're
talking
about
one
word
in
a
three-word
phrase
in
scheidler
ii.
and
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
read
that
phrase
the
way
you
would
read
a
statute.
but
the
second
thing
i
would
say
is
the
one
thing
the
chief
justice
did
not
mean
with
respect
to
the
word
“
exercise
”
is
it
meant
that
it
opened
up
a
big
gap
so
you
could
take
every
coercion
case
and
turn
it
into
an
extortion
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
there's
--
there's
no
federal
crime
and
that's
the
result
of
a
very
deliberative
decision
by
congress
in
1946
in
enacting
the
hobbs
act.
of
course,
they
had
in
front
of
them
the
model
of
the
anti-racketeering
act
of
1934
that
prohibited
both
coercion
and
extortion.
congress
made
a
conscious
decision
to,
in
the
hobbs
act,
prohibit
robbery
and
extortion,
but
not
pick
up
the
prohibition
on
coercion.
and
so
there
isn't
a
federal
crime
directly
on
point,
but
it's
a
very
conscious
decision
by
congress.
and,
of
course,
the
new
york
crime
on
point
is
exquisitely
on
point,
because
not
only
is
there
a
coercion
offense
under
new
york
statute,
but
it
is
an
aggravated
offense
if
the
victim
is
a
government
official
discharging
their
public
duty.
and
so
this
is
really
a
situation
where
the
state
courts
have
a
crime
that
directly
fits.
it's
as
--
i
mean,
it's
almost
amazing,
because
it's
not
just
any
state;
it's
the
state
of
new
york.
and
congress,
in
passing
the
hobbs
act,
was
looking
at
new
york
law.
and
they
looked
at
new
york
law
and
they
said,
new
york
has
a
coercion
prohibition
and
extortion
prohibition.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
i'd
be
happy
to
address
that.
what
happened
is
there
were
some
pretrial
rulings.
and
one
of
the
pretrial
rulings
gave
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
do
some
discovery
on
the
state
government
to
figure
out
whether
this
was
really
done
in
the
discharge
of
public
duties
or
maybe
this
was
sort
of
a
political
thing
that
was
going
on.
and
once
that
state
law
discovery
happened
into
the
government
of
albany,
all
of
a
sudden
the
state
prosecution
didn't
seem
like
such
a
great
idea
anymore.
and
the
federal
prosecutors
are
just
down
the
street,
so
they
were
very
happy
to
lateral
it
to
the
federal
prosecutors
and
have
them
take
it
over.
and
because
the
federal
offense
doesn't
have
an
element
of
interfering
with
the
public
duty,
they
didn't
have
to
worry
about
the
discovery.
and
that
is
just
a
very
concrete
illustration
of
the
problem
of
over-federalizing
crime,
because
this
--
we're
talking
--
this
is
the
opposite
of
the
typical
public
corruption
case
where
you
think,
well,
maybe
there
are
people
in
the
state
government
who
aren't
going
to
--
state
prosecutors
won't
be
willing
to
prosecute
one
of
the
bigs
in
the
state
government,
so
we
need
the
federal
government
to
step
in.
the
one
thing
a
state
doesn't
need
extra
incentive
to
do
is
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
internal
deliberative
process
from
coercion
or
extortion,
for
that
matter.
but
the
--
the
real
cost
then
to
having
these
duplicative
federal
crimes,
and
they
were
front
and
center
in
this
case
--
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
couple
of
points
in
rebuttal.
ms.
harrington
started
by
pointing
to
the
language
in
mcnally.
and
she
is
absolutely
correct
that
at
the
same
time
that
mcnally
got
rid
of
the
honest
services
prosecution
that
was
brought
there,
they
reserved
two
possible
prosecutions.
one
would
be
the
obtaining
of
money,
where
there
was
a
difference
in
what
the
government
paid
for
and
what
the
government
got.
the
other
thing
that
she
alludes
to
is
there
--
the
court
did
say,
well,
maybe
there's
a
possibility
that
you
could
prosecute
based
on
the
government's
loss
of
control
over
its
allocation
of
these
workman's
comp
policies.
the
problem
is,
of
course,
that
mcnally
precedes
cleveland.
and
in
cleveland,
the
government
seized
on
that
language
and
said,
well,
even
if
the
video
poker
license
isn't
property,
the
right
to
control
who
gets
it
is
property,
and
that
got
exactly
zero
votes
from
this
court.
so
i
think
that
argument
is
no
longer
viable.
ms.
harrington
also
points
to
these
new
york
cases
about
the
scope
of
property
for
purposes
of
851
of
the
new
york
penal
code.
but
of
course,
what
we're
talking
about
is
850
of
the
new
york
penal
code,
the
kind
of
property
that
can
be
obtained.
i
think
it's
common
ground
that
--
they
are
not
co-extensive.
there
are
--
there
is
property
that
you
can
obtain
that
you
can't
threaten.
indeed,
the
classic
thing
you
obtained
in
--
in
an
extortion
case
is
money,
and
i'm
not
sure
how
you
really
threaten
money.
you
can
threaten
to
take
money
from
someone,
but
you
don't
really
threaten
the
money.
so
these
are
different
terms.
so
relying
on
the
barondess
case,
which
is
the
same
case
that
justice
stevens
relied
on
in
dissent
in
scheidler
ii
just
doesn't
work.
now,
she's
also
absolutely
correct
that
extortion
at
common
law
only
involved
official
extortion,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
aren't
common
law
places
to
look
for
a
relevant
definition
of
property.
because
the
same
basic
concept
was
in
the
larceny
statutes,
the
--
not
statutes,
the
common
law
crime
of
burglary,
larceny,
and
embezzlement.
and
indeed
to
this
very
day,
new
york
refers
to
extortion
as
larceny
by
extortion.
and
if
you
go
to
those
new
york
cases,
the
place
i
would
point
you
to
is
the
ashworth
case,
which
is
cited
in
both
of
our
briefs.
this
is
a
case
that
makes
very
clear
that
under
new
york
law,
they
didn't
even
think
that
services
at
all
were
property.
this
is
a
case
where
the
foreman
of
a
mill
gets
the
bright
idea
that
he's
going
to
do
some
work
for
his
own
company
using
the
mill's
facilities.
and
he's
charged
with
larceny.
and
the
court
in
that
case
says:
no,
that's
not
larceny,
you
didn't
obtain
any
goods.
classic
sort
of
common
law
property
is
in
order
to
be
the
kind
of
property
that
you
can
steal
or
extort
it
has
to
be
moveable.
one
of
the
elements
of
the
common
law
crime
is
exportation,
removing
it--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--and
if
i
can
just
sort
of
put
the
point:
they
say
all
of
that
and
they
reject
that
argument.
and
they
use
a
line
which
i
think
really
captures
what's
going
on
here.
they
say,
well,
maybe
you
can
conceive
of
such
a
conception
of
property,
but
they
say
to
conceive
this
requires
a
certain
intellectual
flexibility
which
is
probably
not
possessed
by
the
average
person.
and
i
would
simply
submit
it
also
is
not
the
kind
of
flexibility
that
should
be
possessed
by
the
average
judge
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
paul
d.
clement
well,
a
couple
of
things,
justice
sotomayor.
i
went
back
to
the
tropiano
case,
because
it
is
sort
of
the
pro
genitor
of
this
whole
line
of
second
circuit
cases,
and
i
noticed
two
things.
one,
i
noticed
it
was
written
by
a
district
court
sitting
by
designation.
so,
i
mean,
i
--
i
don't
mean
anything
by
that
other
than
this
is
not
marbury.
second,
i
would
say
that
the
second
thing
i
noticed
is
that
the
debt--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--well,
it's
not
--
it's
a
good
thing
you're
no
longer
sitting
in
that
capacity,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
d.
clement
--because
i
--
i
certainly
mean
you
no
offense.
you
could
write
marbury
here.
so
the
--
the
difference
is,
your
honor,
that
that
could
have
also
been,
i
think,
actually
prosecuted
as
a
property
crime,
because
in
that
case,
there
were
customer
accounts
that
were
obtained,
and
those
customer
accounts,
as
the
facts
of
tropiano
discussed
it,
actually
had
value;
they
could
have
been
transferred
from
one
business
to
another.
so
i
think
what
would
happen
in
the
second
circuit,
if
you
decide
this
case
the
way
we
would
like
you
to,
is
the
government's
going
to
have
to
be
careful.
they're
going
to
have
to
write
their
indictments
to
focus
on
things
like
money
or
obtainable
property,
and
they
can't
get
sloppy
and
put
together
these
autonomy
interests
and
call
them
property.
thank
you,
your
honor.
