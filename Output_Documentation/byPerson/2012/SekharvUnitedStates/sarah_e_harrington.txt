ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start,
if
i
could,
where
justice
kennedy
began
and
ended,
which
is
asking
whether
there
would
have
been
extortion
if
the
jury
had
found
here
that
what
--
that
the
property
that
was
obtained
was
the
commissions
at
the
end
of
the
day
after
the
investment.
my
friend
mr.
clement
says
no,
no,
no,
mcnally
says
no.
but
what
mcnally
actually
said
was
the
case
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
property
that
had
been
alleged
to
be
deprived
was
either
money
or
property,
but
it
also
said
it
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
commonwealth
had
been
deprived
of
control
over
how
its
money
was
spent.
and
that's
the
type
of
property
that's
at
issue
here,
control
over
a
property
right.
now--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
he
was
charged
with
attempting
to
obtain
the
commitment,
which
in
most
cases
ends
up
being
the
investment
itself.
that's
not
what
the
jury
found
was
the
property
that
was
obtained,
so
it's
not
the
verdict
that
we
are
here
defending
today.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
that's
what
i'm
saying.
what
he's
saying
is
that
the
obstacle
is
you'd
have
to
prove
that
the
state
was
out
more
money
than
it
would
have
been
if
it
had
invested
in
the
company
it
wanted
to
invest
in.
what
i'm
saying
is
no,
mcnally
said
the
result
would
have
been
different
if
the
state
had
been
deprived
of
control,
of
the
ability
to
control
its
money,
and
that's
the
property
that
would
have
been
obtained
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
because
property
and
control
of
property
are
just
--
are
just
different
aspects
of
the
same
property.
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
exclusive
control
of
property
is
one
vital
aspect
of
private
property.
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
type
of
property
that
was
charged,
that
was
--
that
was
obtained
in
this
case.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
i
guess
i
would
have
two
points.
the
first
is
that
this
is
not
about
honest
services,
because
the
victim
here
is
not
the
state
of
new
york,
it
wasn't
the
citizenry
of
new
york.
that's
the
kind
of--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--whatever--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
i
want
to
separate
again
the
question
of
what
is
property
and
when
property
is
obtained.
under
the
hobbs
act
--
the
hobbs
act
absorbed
the
new
york
state
extortion
law.
and
in
that
--
in
the
--
in
the
cases
construing
that
law,
they
had
construed
the
word
“
property
”
to
include
the
running
of
a
business,
the
engagement
of
a
person
in
their
occupation,
and
the
doing
of
a
job.
people
have
property
interests
in
doing
those
things
because
those
are
the
source
of
economic
wealth
for
those
people.
they
generate
a
stream
of
revenue
for
people
to
live
their
lives
on.
now,
it's
a
different
question
--
not
every
time
you
interfere
with
someone's
doing
of
their
job
are
you
obtaining
that
property.
here,
what
petitioner
was
trying
to
do
was
not
keep
the
general
counsel
from
making
a
recommendation;
he
was
attempting
to
dictate
the
substance
of
what
the
recommendation
was.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
the
ground
is
the
general
particularized
meaning
that
the
word
“
property
”
has
obtained
in
the
law,
and
including
in
new
york
cases
construing
the
very
law
on
which
the
hobbs
act
was
based.
a
person
has
a
property
interest
in
running
their
business.
they
also
have
a
property
interest
in
doing
their
job.
when
--
when
someone
comes
along
and
uses
threats
of
harm
or
threats
of
force
or
violence
to
try
to
get
them
to
do
their
job
in
a
different
way,
what
they
are
doing
is
they
are
taking
control
of
that
property
interest
that
the
person
has.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
you
can
convey
your
labor
to
your
employer
in
that
sense.
when
you
enter
an
employment
contract,
you
are
selling
your
labor
to
your
employer.
and
the
--
the
extent
of
your
right
to
do
that
job
is
then
defined
by
the
parameters
of
your
job.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
that
is
your
labor.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
in
this
case
what
petitioner
was
trying
to
take
was
the
fruits
of
the
general
counsel
--
counsel's
labor.
his
job
was
to
give
his
recommendation
to
his
client
about
what
was
in
keeping
with
the
client's--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
can't,
because
at
common
law
the
person--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--yes,
but
it
was
a
different
crime
at
common
law,
because
it
only
involved
public
officials
taking
money
or
other
thing
of
value
in
exchange
for
doing
something--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
don't
have
an
example
of
that,
but
what
i
do
have
are
examples
from
the
new
york
cases
which
were
construing
the
new
york
state
extortion
law,
and
this
court
has
noted
again
and
again
that
that's
the
basis
for
the
hobbs
act.
congress
was
explicitly
trying
to
evoke
that
law.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
so
i
think
there
are
two
cases.
the
barondess
case
and
the
short
case
are
the
best
cases.
and
in
the
barondess
case,
which
is
from
1893,
i
think,
the
--
the
court
said
that
the
running
of
a
business
was
property.
and
in
the
short
case
the
court
said
that,
just
the
same
way
that
the
running
of
a
business
is
property,
a
person's
doing
their
job
is
property,
and
that
that
can
be
damaged--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
in
those
cases
the
property
wasn't
taken.
under
the
new
york
extortion
law,
the
law
used
“
property
”
in
two
different
places,
and
this
is
noted
in
our
brief.
first,
it
was
something
that
could
be
taken,
that
could
be
obtained
through
extortion;
and
second,
it
was
--
one
of
the
means
of
committing
extortion
with
doing
violence
to
property,
it
was
harming
property.
and
the
court
was
construing
property
--
in
those
cases,
it
was
--
it
was
in
the
latter
sense
of
what
qualified
as
harm
to
property.
but
the
court
said
in
the
short
case,
which
is
from
1911
--
the
court
noted
that
property
is
used
in
--
in
both
provisions,
section
850
and
section
851,
and
said
it
was
construing
it
as
it
was
used
in
both
of
those
sections.
and
in
that
--
that
was
the
case
that
said
doing
a
person's
job,
the
person
has
a
property
interest
in
doing
their
job.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
we
--
that's
absolutely
what
we
are
saying,
in
the
same
way
that
we
said
that
if
the
target
of
the
--
if
the
--
if
the
protesters,
excuse
me,
had
been
trying
to
get
the
clinics,
if
they
had
been
trying
to
take
over
the
clinics
and
get
them
to
provide
a
different
type
of
service,
to
get
them
to
be
a
restaurant
or
to
provide
a
different
type
of
medical
service,
then
they
would
have
been
obtaining
the
right
of
the
--
of
the
clinic
the
right
to
run
--
to
operate
their
business.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes,
because
scheidler
came
out
the
way
it
did
not
because
there
wasn't
property
at
issue,
but
because
there
wasn't
an
obtaining.
and
i
do
think
it's
important
to
try
to
keep
those
two
things
separate.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
you
are
dictating
the
substance
of
what
they
are
doing,
and
so
you
are
obtaining
their
right
to
exercise
their
property
right.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it's
true,
but
the
new
york
courses
--
the
new
york
cases
said
that
they
were
construing
the
word
“
property
”
to
mean
the
same
thing
as
used
--
used
in
both
places
in
the
statute.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
--
to
define
the
word
“
property
”
to
include
the
concept
of
being
obtainable,
because
the
statute
already
separately
requires
that
property
be
obtained
before
there
is
extortion.
just,
if
i
can
just
note
that--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--they
might
not
be,
but
they
are
both
--
but
property
is
property.
that's
our
position,
that
there
is
a
legal
meaning
of
property,
it
includes
the
right
to
run
a
business,
the
right
to
--
to
engage
in
an
occupation.
in
a
particular
instance
that
property
may
not
be
obtainable
and
then
there
won't
be
a
hobbs
act
violation.
but
you
don't
have
to
read
the
obtainability
into
the
definition
of
“
property
”.
it's
the
same
thing.
the
hobbs
act
also
says
that
you
can
commit
a
violation
by
committing
physical
violence
against
property.
now,
in
their
opening
brief,
petitioner
said,
well,
if
something
can't
be
physically
harmed,
it
can't
be
property.
we
are
happy
to
see
in
the
reply
brief
they
sort
of
gave
that
up
by
saying,
"okay,
yeah.
"
"well,
business
secrets
are
property.
"
"a
patent
is
property.
"
"those
things
can't
be
physically
harmed.
"
but
there
is
no
reason
to
read
“
property
”
means
different
things.
if
something
can't
be
physically
harmed,
it
won't
be
the
basis
for
liability
under
that
provision
of
the
hobbs
act.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
exactly--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--right.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
property
means
something
different.
it
just
means
if
it's
property
that
can't
be
harmed,
then
it
--
it
won't
be
a
basis
for
liability
under
that
provision.
i'm
just
saying
you
don't
want
to
give
a
different
definition
to
the
same
word
used
different
times
in
the
same
statute,
when
the
concept
is
--
is
--
where
the
work
is
carried
by
other
words
in
the
statute.
i
think
if
i
could
point
to--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--what
you
are
doing
is
--
what
happened
in
this
case
is
petitioner
was
attempting
to
obtain
control
over
the
fruits
of
the
general
counsel's
labor.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
right,
so
what--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
property
and
exclusive
control
of
property
are
just
different
aspects
of
the
same
thing.
they're
different
sticks
in
the
bundle
that
make
up
the
property.
here,
what
petitioner
was
trying
to
do
was
he
was
trying
to
dictate
the
substance
of
the
recommendation,
and
in
doing
so,
he
was
trying
to
exorcise
the
general
counsel's
right
to
make
the
recommendation,
his
right
to
do
his
job,
and
that
was
his
property.
he
wasn't
just
trying
to
keep
him
from
going
to
work;
he
was
trying
to
literally
dictate
what
the
recommendation
was.
and
that's
how
it
was
charged
in
the
indictment,
that's
what
the
jury
found.
that
was
where
the
obtaining
came
in.
the
--
the
concept
of
property
and
control
of
property
is
well
illustrated
by
this
court's
decision
in
carpenter.
there
the
property
--
one
of
the
pieces
of
property
at
issue
was
confidential
business
information,
which
was
taken
from
the
wall
street
journal.
but
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
really
taken
from
the
wall
street
journal
because
the
wall
street
journal
still
had
the
information
at
the
end
of
the
day.
what
the
court
found
was
taken
from
the
wall
street
journal
was
the
ability
to
control,
to
have
the
exclusive
control
over
the
information.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
i
mean,
you
might
have
an
obtaining
question
if
it's
only
2
percent
of
the
time.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
you
should--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
i
guess
--
i
mean,
it's
sort
of
two
--
two
different
kinds
of
responses.
one
is
that
when
you're
asking
if
something
is
property,
you
want
to
look
at
it
sort
of
on
a
class-wide
or
aggregate
basis.
if
you
have
one,
single
unauthorized
download
of
a
copyrighted
song,
that's
not
necessarily
going
to
cause
harm
to
the
record
company--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--no,
i
understand.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
i'm
just
saying
you
want
to
look
at
something
in
the
aggregate
on
a
class-wide
basis,
and
persons
doing
their
job
on
a
class-wide
basis
is
something
that
is
economically
valuable
to
them.
and
therefore,
it's
property.
i
lost
track
of
what
my
second
response
was
going
to
be.
so
anyway,
the
--
the
hobbs
act
clearly
was
targeted
--
was
trying
to
get
at
racketeering
activity;
it
was
trying
to
get
at
organized
crime
families.
and
congress
knew
that
one
of
the
main
means
that
organized
crime
families
use
was
taking
control
of
businesses.
now,
those
cases
might
seem
easier,
because
taking
control
of
a
brick
and
mortar
business
may
seem
more
obviously
like
property
than
taking
control
of
a
person's
occupation
or
their
job.
but
a
person's
right
to
labor
is
economically
valuable
to
them
and
is
property
to
them
in
the
same
way
that
the
running
of
a
business
is.
now,
petitioner's
view
would
--
if
it
--
i
mean,
his
real
view
is
that
he'd
want
to
wipe
out
the
heartland
of
hobbs
act
organized
crime
prosecutions,
but
i
think
his
fallback
position
is
that
he
would
want
to
wipe
out
any
extortion
of
a
business
that
provides
services
instead
of
providing
a
tangible
good.
but
that
doesn't
make
sense
either.
if
petitioner
had
threatened
harm
to
a
plumber
if
the
plumber
didn't
come
and
--
and
fix
his
leaky
faucet,
he
would
have
been
extorting
that
plumber's
labor,
and
the
same
thing
for
a
gardener,
if
he
tried
to
get
a
gardener
to
come
and
mow
his
lawn.
now,
he
wouldn't
end
up
with
anything
tangible
at
--
at
the
back
end,
but
what
he
would
have
taken
from
those
laborers
would
be
their
right
to
labor,
their
right
to--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
he
wouldn't--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it's
the
same
kind
of
obtaining
here,
because
he
wouldn't
take
the
mowed
lawn
from
the
--
from
the
gardener,
he
wouldn't
take
a
lack
of
leaking
from
the
plumber.
what
he's
taking
from
them
is
their
services
in
order
to
get
a
particular
result.
it's
the
same
thing
here;
he's
trying
to
take
from
the
general
counsel
his
service
of
making
a
recommendation
that's
in
his
client's
best
interest
and
he's
trying
to
dictate
the
substance
of
the
recommendation
to
try
to
get
him
to
give
a
particular
recommendation,
a
positive
recommendation.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
that's
what
i'm
saying--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it
has
economic
value
because
the
lawyer's
job
is
to
give
his
advice
in
keeping
with
his
client's
best
interest.
it's
the
same
thing
as
the
record
company.
a
single
unauthorized
download--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it
is.
if
petitioner
had
tried
to
blackmail
the
general
counsel
every
week
to
give
a
different
recommendation
than
what
he
wanted,
the
result
would
have
been
the
general
counsel
would
have
lost
his
job.
he
would
have
lost
his
stream
of
revenue.
he
might
have
been
disbarred.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
economically
valuable
to
him.
it's
the
same
thing
as
a
single
download
of
a
--
of
a
record
that
might
not
cause
economic
harm
to
a
record
company,
but
it's
still
taking
property,
because
in
the
aggregate,
the
rights
of
that
copyright
or
trademark
have
--
the
property
right
has
value
to
the
record
company.
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
factual
scenario
here.
here,
petitioner
was
trying
to
use
blackmail
to
coerce
a
state
agent
into
doing
something
that
was
against
his
--
his
will
in
order
to
get
a
$35
million
investment
from
the
state.
now,
again,
this
might
seem
like
a
harder
case
than
if
he
was
trying
to
coopt
the
running
of
a
brick
and
mortar
business,
but
what
he
was
trying
to
do
is
coopt
an
individual's
doing
of
his
job.
he's
trying
to
dictate
the
substance
of
the
recommendation.
in
doing
that,
he's
obtaining
property
from
the
victim.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
it
was
charged
on
several
different
theories,
and
one
of
the
theories
was
that
he
was
trying
to
gain
the
commitment
to
the
investment.
now,
the
jury
was
given
choices.
the
jury
circled
the
lawyer's
positive
recommendation
as
the
property
that
was
obtained.
i
assume
that's
because
the
evidence
in
the
case,
the
e-mails
from
petitioner
to
general
counsel
talked
about
the
recommendation
and
so
that
was
a
tangible
thing
in
the
jury's
mind.
it
was
sort
of
that
there
was
a
really
direct
connection
between
what
petitioner
was
saying,
what
he
was
trying
to
do,
and
the
recommendation.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
don't
think
--
i
think
it
could
have
been
charged
that
he
was
trying
to
get
the
money
here.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that
he
was
trying
to
get
commitment;
that
was
one
of
the
choices.
what
they
circled
was
the
recommendation.
now,
who
knows
why
a
jury
does
anything.
i
assume,
like
i
said,
it's
because
that
was
what
the
e-mails
were
about,
they
were
about
the
recommendation.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
they
circled
--
it
says
the
general
counsel's
recommendation
--
this
is
on
the
ja
142.
that's
where
it--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--ja
142.
what
they
circled
was
the
general
counsel's
recommendation
to
approve
the
commitment.
and
i
think
that
wording
is
very
helpful
to
us,
because
it's
not
just
that
he's
trying
to
obtain
a
recommendation
from
the
general
counsel.
he's
trying
to
obtain
a
particular
recommendation,
the
recommendation
to
approve
the
commitment.
i
think
that
encapsulates
both
the
property
and
the
obtaining
that
is
the
theory
of
our
case.
the
general
counsel's
job
was
to
give
his
legal
advice.
the
petitioner
was
trying
to
dictate
the
substance
of
that
legal
advice.
his
property
interest
was
in
doing
his
job.
the
general
counsel
--
the
petitioner
was
trying
to
take
control
of
the
doing
of
the
job,
and
therefore
trying
to
take
the
general
counsel's
property.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
was
always
the
official
who
was
doing
the
extorting.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no.
at
common
law,
it
was
only
limited
to
acts
by
an
official.
there
was
no
--
and
--
and
the
court
has
recognized
that
when
congress
enacted
the
hobbs
act,
it
expanded
the
--
the
reach
of
extortion
in
that
sense,
in
the
same
way
that
new
york
did
when
it
enacted
the
state
extortion
law.
and
i
do
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
--
the
hobbs
act
is
based
on
the
new
york
law
and
we
don't
want
to
just
ignore
the
new
york
cases
that
construe
the
word
“
property
”
to
mean
the
running
of
a
business
and
the
doing
of
a
job.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
it
wasn't
--
i
mean,
it's
true
there
weren't
cases--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
concede
that
point.
i
concede
that
point.
but
it
was
--
it
was
defining
the
word
“
property
”
and
that
property
is
used
twice.
and
so,
again,
it's
a
separate
question
here
whether
the
property
was
obtained.
we
think
it's
clear
that
there
was
property.
we
think
it's
clear
the
property
was
obtained
as
well,
but
those
are
two
separate
questions.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
true
--
i
mean,
it
was
a
separate
crime
of
coercion.
there
was
a
separate
crime
of
coercion
under
new
york
law.
i
think,
you
know,
the
congress
conceived
of
the
hobbs
act
as
a
property
--
as
a
crime
of
--
against
property,
and
so
it
didn't
want
to
include
coercion.
it
included
extortion
and
robbery.
of
course,
every
extortion
crime--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--in
this
case.
well,
i
think
it's
important
to
note,
and
petitioner
doesn't
mention
this,
that
the
attempted
extortion
charge
he
was
initially
charged
with
was
a
misdemeanor
and
the
attempted
coercion
charge
he
ultimately
ended
up
being
charged
with
in
state
law
was
a
felony.
so
i
think
that
explains
what
was
going
on
there.
and
it's
a
good
example
--
it's
a
good
illustration
of
why
it's
hard
to
judge
ex-post
what
happened,
you
know,
what
was
motivating
different
charging
decisions.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
anything
that
doesn't
involve
property.
so
if
you're
trying
to
coerce--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--so,
trying
to
coerce
someone
to
marry
someone
they
don't
want.
i
think,
in
the
scheidler
case--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--because
it's
--
i
think
it's
more
properly
viewed
as
a
liberty
interest.
it's
not
a
source
of
economic
value
in
the
sort
of
traditional
sense.
i
think
if
you
take
the
scheidler
case--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it's
true.
i
walked
into
that
one.
i
think
--
so
let's
take
the
scheidler
case
for
an
example.
there
were
different
types
of
property
that
were
initially
alleged
in
that
case.
one
of
them
was
the
right
of
women
to
access
the
services
of
the
clinic.
this
court
--
this
court
distinguished
that
from
the
other
alleged
property
interests,
which
were
the
running
of
the
business
that
was
the
clinic.
and
the
court
said
that
the
right
of
women
to
access
the
services
of
the
clinic
was
really
more
of
a
liberty
interest
and
the
running
of
a
business
was
really
more
of
--
it
didn't
say
it
was
property
because
it
didn't
have
to
decide
that,
but
it
said
that's
really
more
in
the
nature
of
property.
that
was
the
property
right
alleged.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
think
it's
both.
and
so
someone
--
the
general
counsel
could
have
been
coerced
in
this
case
if
he
had
been
prevented
from
going
to
jobs,
to
his
job.
but
here
what
petitioner
was
trying
to
do
again
was
to
--
to
take
the
substance
of
the
job,
where
he
was
trying
to
take
the
fruits
of
the
labor
of
the
general
counsel
by
trying
to
dictate
the
substance
of
the
recommendation.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
not
on
the
basis
of
property,
but
on
the
basis
of
obtaining.
the
former
is
--
there's
no
obtaining
and
in
the
latter
there's
obtaining
because
what
you're
doing
is
you
are
exercising
the
person's
right
to
do
their
job.
and
the
court
has
said
again
and
again
that
exclusive
control
of
property
is
an
essential
element
of
all
personal
property,
of
all
private
property.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
we
did
use
it,
and
he
was
--
i
mean,
there
are
five
convictions
under
875.
what
happened
is
in
this
case
we
conceded
that
section
875
uses
the
word
“
extort
”.
we
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
“
extort
”
has
the
same
meaning
as
“
extortion
”
under
the
hobbs
act.
and
so
if
there
wasn't
extortion
under
the
hobbs
act,
there
wouldn't
be--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--that's--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--that's
true.
in
this
case,
again,
we
have
treated
them
as
the
same.
but
i
think
you
would
want
to
reserve
for
another
case
the
question
whether
section
875--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
think
“
thing
of
value
”
is
a
broader
term
than
“
property
”.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
right.
so
we
haven't
made
an
argument
about
875
here.
we've
conceded
that
whatever
the
result
is
as
to
the
hobbs
act
would
control
as
to
875.
but
i
do
think
that's
a
question
for
another
case
if
we
don't
prevail
in
this
case.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
again,
i
don't
think
we
are
going
too
far--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but,
justice
scalia,
you
have
already
defined
it
this
broadly
in
cases
dealing
with
section
20
of
the
clayton
act,
the
due
process
clause,
the
scope
of
a
court's
equity
jurisdiction.
the
court
has
said
that
the
running
of
a
business
is
property.
the
court
has
also
said
that
pursuit
of
an
occupation
is
property.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
hear
what
you're
saying.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
property
is
property.
and
it's
true
that
in
extortion
the
property
has
to
be
obtained
for
there
to
be
a
crime.
that
work
is
done
by
the
word
“
obtained
”.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
this
federal
crime
of
extortion
brings
with
--
brings
with
it
the
baggage
of
the
new
york
state
extortion
law,
and
the
new
york
cases
said
in
that
law
the
word
“
property
”
includes
the
running
of
a
business
and
doing
a
job.
it's
true
that
that
wasn't
the
property
being
extorted
in
those
cases,
but
that's
what
they
said
property
means.
and
if
you
are
worried
that
those
things
can't
be
obtained,
you
don't
need
to
worry
--
you
don't
need
to
have
a
special
definition
of
property
to
take
care
of
that,
because
the
hobbs
act
already
requires
that
property
be
obtained
before
there
is
extortion,
so
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
redundancy
built
in
for
that.
again,
i
can
understand
how
--
how
the
main
hobbs
act,
sort
of
heartland
cases
which
involve
the
co-opting
of
a
brick
and
mortar
businesses,
seem
like
easier
cases.
and
you
might
want
to
draw
a
line
between
the
running
of
a
business
and
the
doing
of
labor.
but
a
person
has
a
property
interest
in
doing
their
job
the
same
way
that
they
have
a
property
interest
in
running
a
business.
the
fact
that
they
work
for
someone
else
shouldn't
mean
that
they
have
less
of
an
interest
in
doing
their
job
than
if
they
run
their
own
business.
doing
a
job
is
a
source
of
economic
value
to
a
person
and
the
court
should
construe
it
as
property,
and
the
right
to
exercise
control
over
doing
their
job
is
also
property.
if
the
court
has
no
questions?
