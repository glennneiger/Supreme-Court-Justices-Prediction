mr.
clement,
what
is
--
i'm
sort
of
trying
to
figure
out
why
you're
trying
to
get
the
word
“
property
”
to
do
the
work
of
the
“
obtain
”
part
of
the
statute,
because
when
you
answered
justice
alito
you
were
using
the
terms
of
“
obtain
”
to
define
property,
which
is
in
my
mind
a
sort
of
strange
way
to
do
things,
okay?
property
generally
means
value
of
some
sort
and
you
don't
use
any
of
those
words
in
your
definition.
so,
what
you're
using
in
my
mind,
and
not
illogically,
is
to
say
that
the
second
part
of
the
statute
has
to
do
some
work,
so
it
has
to
mean
that
you're
taking
something
of
value
away
from
someone
else.
that
makes
logical
sense
to
me.
and
i
understand
the
second
piece
of
your
argument,
which
is
the
recommendation
--
not
the
recommendation,
but
his
honest
services
wasn't
being
given
to
your
client,
it
was
being
given
to
the
employer.
so
your
client
obtained
nothing
of
value
for
himself.
he
didn't
get
anything
transferred
to
him.
and
that
--
that
argument
makes
eminent
sense
to
me.
and
i
tease
it
out
of
your
brief,
but
i
don't
know
why
you're
trying
to
get
our
definition
of
“
property
”
to
do
that
work.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
the
work
in
the
“
obtain
”
part?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
take
the
government's
definition
that
property
is
anything
of
value.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
and
let's
assume,
because
it
--
as
i
said,
that
seems
to
have
some
sort
of
conceptual
appeal.
then
make
the
argument
for
me.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
make
your
argument
for
me
why
this
isn't
an
obtaining.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
--
going
back
a
little
bit
to
justice
breyer's
question,
how
do
you
gain
possession
of
someone's
advice
or
how
they
do
their
job
when
it's
not
giving
you
a
direct
benefit;
it's
something
that
belongs
to
someone
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
problem,
this
obtaining
controlled
concept.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
you're
--
you're
equating
taking
control
with
possession.
and
that's
where
i'm
having
difficulty.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
didn't
think
they
circled
recommendation.
they
circled
his
honest
advice,
didn't
they?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
clement,
when
you
finish--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--let
--
look,
i
think
if
we
take
your
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion,
what
you
are
telling
us
is,
do
away
with
the
second
circuit's
tropiano
decision,
and
the
large
progeny
of
cases
that
come
from
it.
the
most
common
is
the
threat
to
a
business
that
says
pull
out
of
this
market
because
we
don't
want
you
in
it.
and
we
want
all
the
customers.
and
courts
routinely
have
said
that's
a
hobbs
act
violation.
you're
using
the
threat
of
force
to
tell
people
to
keep
out
of
a
particular
market.
today
you
are
telling
us
that
under
your
theory
of
the
hobbs
act
and
your
definition
of
property,
that
doesn't
count
as
a
hobbs
act
violation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
i
think
when
i
sat
as
a
district
court
judge,
i
would
have
been
insulted
by
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
it's
really--
