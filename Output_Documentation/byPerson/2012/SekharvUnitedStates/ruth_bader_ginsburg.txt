but
it's
--
the
coercion
crime,
at
least
under
new
york's
definition,
requires
force.
and
--
and
here,
it's
a
threat
of
exposure
of
an
embarrassing
fact.
so,
what
--
am
i
right
about
that,
that
the
coercion,
which
is
not
a
federal
crime
but
is
a
state
crime,
requires
a
threat
of
force
to
restrict
him
of
his
freedom?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
--
you
said
transfer,
sell,
but
there's
also
exercise.
and
the
theory
is
that
the
defendant
sought
to
take
away
the
officer's
right
to
make
this
recommendation,
take
it
away
from
the
officer,
exercise
it
himself.
so
why
doesn't
it
fit
--
why
isn't
this
an
intangible
right
taken
from
one
and
exercised
by
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
--
there
is,
i
take
it,
no
federal
crime
that
this
conduct
would
fit?
you
said
new
york
state
has
a
coercion
crime
which
you
say
this
conduct
might
fit.
but
there's
no
federal
crime.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
why
did
--
why
did
new
york
--
was
the
new
york
case
dropped
and
the
state
officials
urged
the
government,
the
federal
government,
to
make
this
a
federal
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
was
it
--
could
you
tell
us
a
little
more?
how
was
it
taken?
