mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
erisa
permits
plan
fiduciaries
to
seek
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan.
six
years
ago,
this
court,
in
sereboff,
concluded
that
reimbursement
actions
by
erisa
plans,
such
as
the
one
at
issue
here,
seek
equitable
liens
by
agreement.
and
because
the
plan's
claim
here
is
one
for
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
that
means
one
person
with
equitable
defenses,
those
derived
from
unjustment
enrichment,
offer
no
help
to
respondents.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
certainly
are,
justice
sotomayor,
bound
by
equity.
our
contention
is
not
that
once
you
say
the
magic
words
“
equitable
lien
by
agreement
”,
that
somehow
transforms
into
a
“
we
win
”
as
plaintiffs.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
quite
to
the
contrary,
justice
sotomayor,
our
position
is
that
the
rules
of
equity
bind
equitable
liens
by
agreement
just
as
they
bind
anything
else.
we're
not
trying
to
say
that
the
equity
doesn't
apply--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so,
our
position
is
that
the
attorney
doesn't
--
there
is
no
lien
created
with
the
attorney;
that
once
mr.
sereboff
signed
--
entered
into
an
agreement
with
us
air,
that
agreement
said
--
provided
for
100
percent
reimbursement
rights.
and
there
is
no
--
essentially,
what
happened
is
mr.
sereboff
--
mr.
--
mr.
mccutchen
double-promised
his
money.
he
promised
it
first
to
--
first
to
the
us
airways
plan,
and
then
he
promised
it
to
--
to
his
attorneys.
and
that's
a
problem
that
he
might
have
with
his
attorneys,
although,
as
i
understand
the
facts
here,
maybe
that
debt
has
been
forgiven,
but
it
is
not
something
that
creates
an
independent
lien
on
the
money
that's
at
issue
here.
that
is,
the
rules
in
equity
say
that
it
is
the
agreement
that
controls
--
when
we're
talking
about
an
un
--
when
we're
talking
about
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--right.
so
our
position
is
not
that
sereboff's
letter
controls
this
case.
we
do
think
the
reasoning
of
sereboff
essentially
does
decide
the
question,
because
what
sereboff
said,
justice
ginsburg
--
and
this
is
at
page
368
of
the
opinion
in
the
text
--
it
said
--
the
sereboffs
had
argued
the
make-whole
doctrine.
and
the
--
in
response,
what
this
court
said
is,
quote,
"mid
atlantic's
claim
is
not
considered
equitable
because
it
is
a
subrogation
claim.
"
"mid
atlantic's
action
qualifies
as
an
equitable
remedy
because
it
is
indistinguishable
from
an
action
to
enforce
an
equitable
lien
established
by
agreement
of
the
sort
epitomized
by
our
decision
in
barnes.
"
mid
atlantic
need
not
characterize
this
action
as
a
freestanding
action
for
equitable
subrogation.
accordingly,
the
parcel
of
equitable
defenses
the
sereboffs
claim
accompany
any
such
action
are
beside
the
point.
“
beside
the
point
”.
and
our
position
is
once
the
court
has
decided
that
the
type
of
action
that
is
at
issue
here
is
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
the
relevant
doctrine
--
and
this
is
further
answer
to
you,
justice
sotomayor
--
that
the
court
is
to
look
to
is
how
are
equitable
liens
by
agreement
evaluated
in
equity.
and
those
rules
in
equity
say
that,
again,
the
general
rules
of
equity
apply
in
government;
but,
the
one
place,
the
one
set
of
defenses
that
aren't
governed,
are
those
that
sound
an
unjust
enrichment.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
true
in
some
subrogation
states.
however,
even
with
respect
to
that,
when
you
have
--
as
long
as
it's
not
abrogated
by
statute
or
something
like
that.
but
if
you
simply
have
an
agreement
by
an
insured
and
it
provides
for
100
percent
reimbursement
and
abrogation
of
the
common
fund,
even
there,
justice
kennedy,
the
agreement
is
enforced.
so
state
farm
v.
clinton,
which
is
a
case
cited
in
our
brief,
as
long
as
--
as
well
as
the
dobbs
case
and
other
decisions
--
the
arkansas
supreme
court
in
1969,
the
arkansas
court
in
1931
--
have
all
said
that
if
you
have
an
insurance
agreement
that
abrogates
the
common
fund
doctrine,
that
that
agreement
is
enforced.
and,
here,
of
course,
we're
dealing--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
ginsburg,
the
district
court
at
pages
30a
to
32a
of
the
petition
appendix,
had
two
pages
that
found
the
agreement
clear
and
unambiguous
with
respect
to
abrogation
of
the
common
fund
doctrine.
and
the
plan
itself
is
found
at
joint
appendix
page
20.
that
finding
by
the
district
court
was
never
appealed
to
the
third
circuit,
it
was
not
appealed
to
this
court,
and,
indeed,
the
brief
in
opposition
conceded
this
issue.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes.
the
summary
plan
description
is
at
page--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--exactly.
and
so
the
plan
itself
was
submitted,
i
believe,
a
few
days
ago.
the
respondents
have
now
made
an
issue
of
it.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
your
honor,
i
suppose
that
--
that
they
could
have
made
this
an
issue
when
they
appealed
the
district
court's
finding
on
this.
they
didn't.
and,
indeed,
there
was
discovery--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
much
to
the
--
and
much
to
the
contrary,
justice
scalia,
exactly,
this
is
the
way
that
they
framed
the
brief
in
opposition.
the
question
presented
is
this,
"whether
a
seriously
injured
erisa
beneficiary
must
reimburse
his
erisa
plan
for
100
percent
of
his
medical
expenses
simply
because
the
plan
language
so
provides.
"
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
two
things,
justice
kennedy.
first,
that
brief
in
opposition
goes
on
to
say
that
that
plan
was
clear
with
respect
to
the
common
fund
doctrine
and
others
at
page
5.
but,
second,
if
you're
concerned--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
second
point
--
the
second
point
is
even
if
you
are
concerned
about
any
discrepancy,
point
--
4.2
of
the
actual
plan
itself,
and
this
is
page
22
of
the
pdf
that
was
submitted
by
--
lodged
by
my
friends
on
the
other
side
a
few
days
ago,
has
essentially
an
anti-amara
clause
in
it.
it
says
that
the
benefits
that
are
provided
under
the
plan
are
those
put
forth
in
the
summary
plan
description.
so
there
is
no
discrepancy
between
the
spd
in
the
plan
in
this
case,
unlike
in
amara
where
there
very
well
was
a
discrepancy.
so
here--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
the
plan
has
in
4.7
two
things.
it
has
the
plan
--
quote,
"the
plan
shall
have
the
right
to
recover
from
any
participant
the
amount
of
any
benefits
paid
by
this
plan
for
expenses
which
were
recovered
from
or
paid
by
a
source
other
than
this
plan.
"
and
then
later,
in
4.6,
it
says
participants
are
--
quote,
"are
obligated
to
avoid
doing
anything
that
would
prejudice
the
plan's
right
of
recovery.
"
so
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
discrepancy,
justice
sotomayor.
and
to
the
extent
that
this
court
were
concerned
about
it,
there
were
4
years
for
them
to
have
made
this
an
issue,
but
this
is
just
about
as
procedurally
barred
as
--
as
anything--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--all
right.
and,
justice
breyer,
if
you
were
the
district
court
judge
in
this
case,
i
suppose
you
could
have
reached
that
result.
the
district
court
here--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--well,
they
--
they
had
the
summary
plan
description,
and
they
did
not
make
an
issue.
but
they
had
all
sorts
of
discovery
requests,
but
never
made
a
request
for
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--justice
breyer,
we
absolutely
agree
that
a
plan
could
be
written
in
order
to
embrace--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--but
i
think
it
would
be
highly
unusual
for
this
court,
indeed,
i
think,
procedurally
unavailable
for
this
court
to--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
so,
again,
we're
not
overriding
with
the
principle
of
equity.
we're
saying
that
the
rules
of
equity,
if
they
have
in
the
plan
an
abrogation
of
the
common
fund,
as
that
is
here,
in
the
way
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
then
that
is
what
settles
the
question.
now,
you
could
have
a
sereboff
plan,
which
says
the
reverse,
which
says,
we're
going
to
have
a
common
fund
doctrine,
and
avoid
that
problem
at
the
outset.
the
parties
evaluate
the
valuation
of
the
transfer
of
assets
at
the
outset,
and
that's
what
controls.
and
if
they
want
to
buy
into
the
common
fund,
as
this
court
said
in
sereboff,
that's
absolutely
enforceable.
and
so
it's
not
a
contract
around,
justice
sotomayor,
doctrines
of
equity.
it's
simply
a
reflection
of
the
general
rule
that,
in
equity,
if
--
when
we're
talking
about
equitable
liens
by
agreement,
it
is
the
agreement
that
controls,
that
starts
the
ball
game.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
sure.
if
they
had
asked
for
the
plan,
it
could
have
been
provided
to
them.
they
have--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i'm
not
quite
sure
about
that.
i
will
look
into
that
and
try
and
get
you
an
answer
on
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
sotomayor,
at
the
outset,
they
asked
for
the
summary
plan
description
or
the
plan.
the
summary
plan
description
was
provided.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
their
lawyer.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
--
and
i
should
say,
the
minute
that
us
air
found
out
that
a
tort
--
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
was
hired,
they
sent
a
letter
to
that
lawyer
saying,
we
assert
a
right
of
reimbursement.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
so,
justice
kagan,
there
are
two
very
distinct
rights.
subrogation
is
the
right
to
stand
in
someone
else's
shoes.
and
so
the
insured
--
the
plan
says,
we
are
going
to
inherit
all
of
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
the
insured
in
bringing
an
action.
it's
a
vicarious
--
it's
a
kind
of
vicarious
notion.
reimbursement's
an
entirely
different
concept.
it's
the
idea
that,
look,
we're
not
obligated
to
give
you
this
money
because
we're
not
at
fault
in
this
accident,
but
we're
going
to
essentially
advance
it
to
you,
but
you've
got
to
reimburse
us
for
it.
and
so--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--so
if
it
were
a
subrogation
agreement,
i
think
my
friend's
case
on
the
other
side
gets
a
lot
stronger
because
there
are
subrogation
cases
that
--
that
have
different
rules.
but
when
you
talk
about
reimbursement,
which
is
not
the
right
to
stand
in
someone's
shoes,
but
a
first
priority,
absolute
agreement
between
the
parties
to
get
money,
it's
just
simply
a
dispute
about
that
money.
and
you
can't--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--there
is
an
argument,
and,
indeed,
all
i
think
you
have
to
do,
justice
kagan,
is
look
at
what
happened
in
sereboff,
because
in
sereboff
you
had
essentially
the
same
thing,
a
plan
that
had
both
a
reimbursement
provision
and
a
subrogation
provision.
and
the
--
the
beneficiaries
in
sereboff
were
saying,
hey,
this
is
subrogation,
this
is
subrogation.
and
the
language
that
i've
read
to
justice
ginsburg
at
page
368,
as
well
as
earlier
language
in
the
opinion,
said,
no,
this
is
actually
a
claim
for
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement
that
does
not
sound
in
subrogation,
that
sounds
in
reimbursement.
and
so
all
you
have
to
do
here
is
precisely
what
this
court
unanimously
did
in
sereboff,
which
is
to
say,
look
at
the
nature
of
the
action,
is
this
an
action
that
seeks
personal
liability,
does
it
specify
a
particular
fund,
the
typical
hallmarks
of
an
action
for
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement;
and,
if
those
are
present,
as
they
are
here,
that
is
enough.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
not
at
all,
justice
alito.
two
things.
one,
the
rule
on
erisa
--
and
this
rule
has
been
the
rule
in
the
third
circuit
since
federal
express
v.
ryan
in
1996.
this
is
a
long-established
rule
--
if
an
attorney
comes
and
takes
a
case
knowing
that
there
is
a
--
an
erisa
plan
at
stake,
seems
to
me
they're
at
least
on
inquiry
notice
that
there
would
be
some
sort
of--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--not
so.
this
is
both
in
our
brief,
as
well
as
the
blue
cross
amicus
brief.
what
usually
happens
in
these
situations
is
that
an
agreement
is
struck
in
advance,
before
the
lawsuit
is
filed,
between
the
plan
and
the
plaintiff's
attorney
to
reach
some
accommodation.
after
all,
the
plan
has
an
incentive
in
some
sort
of
action
being
brought--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
quite
is
an
accurate
statement
of
the
facts.
that
was
precisely
what
the
district
court
evaluated
on
the
summary
judgment
motion.
they
made
a
big
issue
about
our
failure
to
communicate
and
so
on.
the
district
court
rejected
all
of
those
arguments--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
do
--
i
do
think
that
there
were
lots
--
and
this
is
in
joint
appendix,
pages
50
to
64
--
lots
of
communications
between
the
two.
now,
here's
--
there
was
one
place
where
there
wasn't
communication,
which
was
they
went
and
negotiated
a
secret
settlement
of
$100,000.
and
when
us
air
found
out
about
it--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
am
suggesting
that
we
didn't
have
the
opportunity,
justice
sotomayor,
that
we
typically
do
in
the
lion's
share
of
cases,
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
alito,
where
you
work
these
things
out
in
agreement
--
in
advance
with
clear
lines
of
communication.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
because
the
common
fund
rule
--
and
this
we
are
in
agreement
on,
the
parties
--
the
common
fund
rule
is
a
doctrine
based
in
unjust
enrichment.
this
is
what
they
say
at
page
26.
this
is
what
all
the
courts
say
common
fund
is.
and,
indeed,
up
until
six
months
ago,
seven
different
circuit
courts
had
evaluated
this
question
of
whether
the
agreement
can
trump
the
common
fund
doctrine.
21
of
21
circuit
court
judges
all
said
it
did.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
yes.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
precisely
right.
the
agreement
sets
the
evaluation
of
the
parties.
that's
what
the
state
farm
case
says,
what
their
own
treatise
says,
what
the
arkansas
supreme
court
says.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
correct.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
says
at
page
17,
quoting
the
restatement,
"a
valid
contract
defines
the
obligations
of
parties
as
to
matters
within
its
scope
displacing
to
that
extent
any
inquiry
into
unjust
enrichment.
"
any
inquiry.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
begin
where
mr.
wessler
left
off,
with
the
common
fund,
and
make
three
quick
points.
the
first
is
that
both
equity
law
and
erisa
law
point
in
the
same
direction.
justice
scalia
is
absolutely
right,
that
they
have
zero
cases
that
say
if
there's
a
preexisting
agreement
that
settles
the
common
fund
doctrine,
that
makes
it
not
enforceable.
and
justice
ginsburg's
absolutely
right
to
say
that
when
the
plan
--
the
plan
is
not
unjustly
enriched
to
get
the
money
that
they
are
entitled
to
get
under
the
contract.
the
second
point
i
would
make
is
that
the
solicitor
general
says,
well,
this
is
now--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
agree.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
sotomayor,
that's
precisely
what
cases
like
state
farm
and
the
arkansas
case
from
1969,
the
maryland
case
from
1931
address,
which
is
that
situation.
and
the
reason
is
that
essentially
here,
it's
a
mistake
to
see
this
as
a
third-party
case.
this
is
really
a
situation
created
by
mr.
mccutchen
double-promising
the
same
money
to
two
entities,
us
air
and
to
his
lawyers.
and
so
it's
essentially
a
dispute
really
among
two
parties,
not
three.
now,
the
solicitor
general
says,
well,
this
is
rooted
in
equitable
doctrine.
there
is
no
case
that
they
have
that
says
that
there's
some
equitable
doctrine
that
trumps
the
preexisting
agreement.
and,
indeed,
the
case
that
they
cite,
the
greenough
case,
is
one
that
essentially
relies
on
unjust
enrichment
principles.
sure,
the
court
has
an
equity
power
when
to
remedy
unjust
enrichment.
that
is
an
inherent
power
of
the
court.
we're
not
disagreeing
with
that.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
when
you
have
an
agreement
in
advance,
that
means,
per
se,
there
is
no
unjust
enrichment,
that
they
are
to
use
this
court's
language
in
the
sereboff
defense
that
it
is
beside
the
point.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that
is
precisely--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--that
is
correct.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
congress
in
1974
set
it
up
this
way.
and
i
think
that
that's
an
important
point,
justice
sotomayor.
for
38
years,
this
court
has
never
embraced
an
idea
that
federal
common
law
allows
rewriting
plan
terms.
it
would
be
a
very
dangerous
doctrine
to
do
so;
it'd
be
standardless.
and
here
is
a
very
vivid
example.
they
are
saying
that
it
is
inequitable
to
have
the
federal
blue
cross
blue
shield
plan,
which
governs
4.6
million
people,
including
perhaps
members
of
this
court,
which
has
the
exact
same
provisions
as
the
us
air
plan:
an
abrogation
of
common
fund
and
a
100
percent
reimbursement
provision.
and
they
are
saying
that
that
would
not
be
enforceable.
that
may
create
any
number
of
problems
for
the
government,
i
imagine,
when
it
tries
to
enforce
that.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
breyer,
if
the
agreement
settled
that
in
advance,
yes,
it
would
not
be
unjust.
it
is
the
agreement
that
controls.
