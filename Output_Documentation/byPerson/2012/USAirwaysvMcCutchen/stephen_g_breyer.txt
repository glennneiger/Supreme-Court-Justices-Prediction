justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
i
were
--
if
i
were
joe
smith,
and
a
plan
--
the
plan
pays
me
100
--
i
have
medical
expenses
of
$100,000.
and,
actually,
the
--
the
--
there
was
a
driver
who
caused
this
problem.
and
later,
i
collect
$100,000,
but
i
have
to
pay
50,000
to
get
the
100,000.
so
i
am
left
with
$50,000
net,
because
i
had
to
pay
my
lawyers,
i
had
to
pay
expert
witnesses.
there
were
a
lot
of
different
things
i
had
to
pay.
i'm
left
with
$50,000
now.
so
in
comes
the
plan
and
says,
we
want
100,000.
i
say,
what?
then
i
look
at
the
language.
the
language
allows
them
to
get
back
expenses
which
were
recovered
from
the
third-party.
i
didn't
recover
100,000
from
the
third-party.
i
recovered
50,000
from
the
third-party,
because
it
cost
me
50
to
get
the
100.
now,
if
i
were
a
judge
and
listening
to
that,
i'd
say,
assuming
they
wanted
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
this
language,
sounds
pretty
reasonable
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
--
here,
since
nobody
had
the
plan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but,
i
mean,
wouldn't
the
normal
result
of
such
a
case,
like
any
contract
case,
where
you
have
language,
even
if
it
was
the
word
“
any
”,
it
doesn't
mean
wheat
grown
on
mars,
okay?
and
so
you'd
say
--
if
it
says
you
can
recover
anything,
that
“
any
expense
”,
it
means,
yes,
you
can
recover
that
which
was
paid,
but
not
money
that
you
had
to
pay
to
get
the
amount
paid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
this
is
a
plan
that
they
wrote
and
that
us
air--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
so
i
can--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
issue
of
law?
the
issue
of
law
is
what
happens
if
we
have
a
plan
which
says
joe
smith,
my
employee,
if
you
have
to
spend
$90,000
to
get
back
92,000,
you
have
to
give
us
back
all
92,
even
though
you
only
have
2
in
pocket.
and
we
are
supposed
to
assume
that's
what
the
contract
said.
is
that
right?
and
then
--
and
then
we
say,
now,
can
you
override
that
with
the
principle
of
equity;
is
that
the
issue
you
see
before
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
my
exact
question.
i
think
now
what
we're
being
asked
to
decide
is,
from
your
point
of
view,
does
the
common
fund
doctrine
apply?
i
take
it,
the
common
fund
doctrine
says,
if
this
victim
here
got
some
money
back
from
the
person
who
caused
the
accident,
that
that
money
goes
into
a
common
fund
in
the
sense
that
those
who
share
in
the
fund
must
share
as
well
in
the
cost
of
producing
the
fund.
so
if
it
costs
$50,000
to
produce
$100,000,
which
is
in
the
fund,
that
we
have
to
have
us
air
as
well
pay
part
of
the
cost
of
producing
the
fund.
that
sounds
very
fair.
but
i
hear
the
argument,
fair
though
it
is,
we
have
here
an
agreement,
and
in
this
agreement
it
says,
it's
as
if
it
said,
and
you
shall
not
apply
the
common
fund
doctrine
or
any
other
equitable
doctrine
such
as
he
who
seeks
equity
must
do
equity,
etc.
and
i
think
that's
the
question
that's
being
asked.
and
so
what
is
your
response
to
that?
in
particular,
why
do
you
say
the
common
fund
doctrine
applies,
though
the
contract
says
it
doesn't,
we
assume,
but
all
these
other
equitable
doctrines
don't
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
good.
so
now
we
have
18th
century
authority
which
says
that
in
the
18th
century,
lord
cooke
or
someone
said
that
the
common
fund
doctrine
applies,
but
the
other
doctrines
don't.
and
the
--
and
the
name
and
citation
to
that
authority
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
--
why
is
it
so
unfair?
i've
been
putting
it
in
a
way
that
looks
unfair,
which
favors
your
side.
but
us
air
or
the
equivalent
says,
now,
here
is
the
deal,
we'll
pay
your
medical
expenses.
and
now,
if
somebody
causes
those
expenses,
you
come
to
us,
and
we
decide
whether
we
want
to
sue
and
get
our
expenses
back,
and
any
extra
money
we
give
to
you,
and
we
pay
our
attorneys'
fees
extra.
they
don't
count
against
the
fund.
and
if
our
lawyers
tell
us
it
isn't
worth
it,
you're
free
to
sue;
but,
i'll
tell
you
what,
your
lawyer
is
going
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
queue.
we're
first,
then
comes
your
lawyer,
and
anything
left
over
goes
to
you.
now,
if
you
can
find
a
lawyer
that
takes
it
on
those
conditions,
good
for
you.
but
he
might,
because
he
might
think
he's
going
to
get
--
but
our
lawyers
have
already
told
us
it's
not
going
to
work,
so
that's
the
situation.
now,
what's
--
i'm
not
--
i
think
us
air's
point
would
be,
well,
what's
unfair
about
that?
that's
--
that
makes
sure
we
get
our
money
back.
that's
what
we
want
to
do.
and
you're
free
to
sue;
it's
just
your
lawyer
who's
going
to
come
at
the
end
of
the
queue,
okay?
what's
--
why
is
that
unfair?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
enter
best
case.
what
is
your
best
case?
i'd
love
to
find
it.
there's
a
case
that
says
something
like
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
--
well,
let
me
tell
you
what
i'm
thinking
of.
the
--
there
is
a
contract
all
written
down.
they
forgot
to
put
a
seal
on
it.
they
forgot
to
put
a
seal
on
it,
so
i
guess
it's
now
1463
or
some
year
like
that.
so
they
go
into
equity.
and
now,
they
are
in
equity.
and
the
plaintiff
says,
judge,
i
want
you
to
enforce
this
contract.
he
says,
i'm
a
judge
in
equity.
he
says,
i
know,
but
we've
agreed,
and
you
enforce
it
in
equity.
the
contract
says
give
smith
all
the
wheat,
and
equity
says,
you
know,
there
are
other
people
who
would
like
some
of
this
wheat,
too,
so
we
are
not
going
to
follow
the
contract.
we
are
going
to
modify
the
contract
according
to
equitable
principles,
which,
as
you
say,
they
can
do.
and
the
other
side
says,
no,
they
wouldn't.
they'd
follow
the
contract.
they
are
just
in
equity
because
they
forgot
the
seal.
okay.
what
is
your
best
case
to
show
they
did,
indeed,
modify
it
with
the
common
fund
doctrine
or
some
other
doctrine?
i
want
to
be
sure
to
read
it
with
a
magnifying
glass.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know,
but
i
didn't
ask
you
about
what
they
found.
i
was
asking
what
you
found.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
the
expense
weren't
to
pay
the
lawyer.
suppose,
in
order
to
get
the
100,000,
you
had,
for
example,
to
build
a
model
car
to
demonstrate
to
the
manufacturer
who
had
caused
the
injury,
and
it
cost
you
98,000
to
do
it.
and
they
pay
you
100,000.
you're
saying
that
--
it
wouldn't
be
unjust
to
say
the
100,000
has
to
go
to
--
back
to
pay
us
air?
