justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
think
we
took
this
case
to
review
the
plan.
is
--
is
that
what
the
supreme
court
took
the
case
for,
to
say
what
this
particular
individual
plan
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
that
--
had
that
point
been
raised,
we
would
not
have
taken
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry.
maybe--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
please.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
i
guess
your
opponent
could
have
raised
that
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
didn't
raise
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
took
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
an
issue
of
law
involved--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
--
not
on
the
assumption--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say,
“
they
”.
i
assume
you
mean
their
lawyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not,
you
know,
an
ignorant
layman
who
knows
nothing
about
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
lawyer,
you
say,
did
not
ask
for
the
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
unusual.
the
motto
is
equity
follows
the
law.
doesn't
--
doesn't
that
usually
--
isn't
that
usually
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
there
is
a
legal
right,
equity
cannot
overcome
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
equitable
powers
to
enforce
the
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you
can
say
that
about
any
legal
rule,
that
some
courts
bollox
them
up.
i
mean,
that
means
the
rule
doesn't
exist,
because
it's
sometimes
used
in
a
confusing
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
rule?
do
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
the
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
an
agreement
that
contradicted
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
have
an
agreement
here,
so
how
does
--
how
does
that
line
of
authority
apply?
because
we
have
an
agreement
which
says
that
the
insurance
company
gets
all
the
money.
so
you
either
say
that
that
agreement
can
be
overcome
by
equity,
or
else
you
say
the
agreement
prevails.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
only
has
the
powers
to
enforce
the
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
various
equitable
powers,
and
it
can
use
various
of
them
to
enforce
the
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
quite
different
from
rewriting
the
agreement,
which
is
what
you
are
using
it
for
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
do
you
really
think
that
if
--
if
an
equity
court
finds
the
agreement
to
be
unfair,
it
can
say,
he
who
seeks
equity
must
do
equity,
and
rewrite
the
agreement
so
that
it's
fairer?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
never
doubted
that
before.
was
it
thought
before
that
all
the
equitable
powers
did
not
exist
under
erisa?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
be
self-evident
that
court
had
all
equitable
powers.
that's
not
a
change
in
the
law.
it's
just
a
restatement
of
the
obvious.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
opponent
says
this
is
not
a
subrogation
agreement,
so
that
argument
goes
nowhere.
he
would
concede
that
point.
you
have
to
tell
us
why
this
is
a
subrogation
agreement,
even
though
you
conceded
below
that
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
i
say
you've
conceded.
that's
a
common
fund
doctrine.
your
opponent
denies
that
the
common
fund
doctrine
applies.
and
it
says
this
is
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
so
that
the
common
fund
doctrine
doesn't
apply.
now,
you
say
it
is
not
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
whenever
you
have
a
contract
that
explicitly,
although,
you
know,
nowadays
when
the
merged
bars,
i
suppose,
you
wouldn't
even
have
to
say
it,
but
let's
assume
it
explicitly
says
that
rights
under
this
contract
can
be
enforced
in
law
or
--
at
law
or
in
equity.
whenever
--
whenever
you
have
a
contract
like
that,
it's
going
to
be
up
to
the
court
of
equity
to
decide
whether
it's
fair?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
this
a
legal
claim?
it
--
it's
--
it's
a
promise
made
in
a
contract.
why
is
that
not
a
legal
claim?
to
be
sure,
the
contract
says
that
--
that,
you
know,
all
equitable
remedies
are
available
to
enforce
that
claim.
but
why
is
it
an
equitable
claim,
not
a
legal
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
case
is
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
from
what
court,
what
--
what
year?
