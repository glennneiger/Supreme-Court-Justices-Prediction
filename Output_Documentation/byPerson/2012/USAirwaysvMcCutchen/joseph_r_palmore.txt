mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court's
cases
recognize,
section
502(a)(3)
invokes
the
equitable
powers
of
the
district
court.
all
of
the
remedial
powers
of
a
court
in
equity
are
available
that
--
under
section
502(a)(3)
that
would
have
been
available
when
an
analogous
claim
was
brought.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
yes.
and
so
we
agree
with
mr.
katyal
in
what
we've
characterized
as
the
first
question
presented,
that
we
think
is
essentially
decided
by
this
court's
case
in
sereboff.
at
equity,
when
there
was
a
--
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
that
agreement
was
generally
enforceable
according
to
its
terms.
it
was
like
a
mortgage,
is
the
classic
case,
and
the
mortgage
gave
a
security
interest
in
land;
and,
if
the
debt
was
not
paid
off,
then
the
lienholder
could
--
could
foreclose
on
that
land.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
i
think
that's
a
--
the
--
there
is
certainly
a
distinction,
and
the
couch
insurance
treatise
talks
about
the
distinction.
but
the
couch
insurance
treatise
also
explains
that
the
terms
are
often
used
interchangeably
in
a
confusing
way.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
bright
line
that
mr.
katyal
seeks
to
establish
between
subrogation
and
reimbursement
is
necessarily
reflected
in
all
the
cases
and
all
the--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--no,
i
think
it's
just
the
fact
that
the
courts
do
use
these
terms
interchangeably.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
acknowledge
that
when
there
is
a
--
when
there
is
a
contractual
plan-based
reimbursement
provision
like
this,
it
is
enforceable
as
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
in
the
same
way
that
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement
would
have
been--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--right.
we
think
--
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
this
is
a
case
for
reimbursement.
this
is
just
like
sereboff,
and
this
is
a
reimbursement
agreement.
what
--
what
adds
to
the
confusion
is
that
--
and
if
you
look
at
more
modern
insurance
decisions,
they're
bringing
in
all
kinds
of
concepts
from
state
law,
from
insurance
law,
from
public
policy
of
the
state.
they
don't
necessarily
reflect
what
would
have
happened
in
a
court
in
equity
at
the
time
of
the
divided
bench,
and
that's
the
import--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--because
we
think
the
equitable
doctrines
that
apply
are
the
equitable
doctrines
that
would
have
applied
at
equity.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
there
is
not
one
authority
that
is
going
to
give
you
both
--
both
answers.
but
the
equitable
lien
by
agreement
cases
from
the
time
of
equity,
as
i
mentioned
before,
were
typically
mortgage
cases
or
a
promise
to
provide
future
acquired
funds
to
discharge
a
debt.
and
it's
clear
under
those
cases
that
that
could
be
executed,
according
to
its
terms.
the
unjust
enrichment
principles
that
respondent
is
invoking
were
in
really
a
different
silo
involving
equitable
restitution.
and
this
court
in
sereboff
said,
we
are
not
going
to
look
at
equitable
restitution
principles,
we
are
going
to
look
at
equitable
lien
by
agreement
cases.
now,
there
is
a
separate
line
of
authority
involving
the
common
fund
that
we
talk
about
in
our
brief,
and,
as
mr.
katyal
said,
it
has
at
times
been
characterized
as
an
unjust
enrichment
doctrine,
but
its
roots
are
different.
its
roots
are
actually
in
an
analogy
to
trust
law.
if
you
look
back
to
the
principal
case
that
established
this,
the
greenough
case
that
we
talk
about
in
our
brief,
the
court
said
that
mr.
vose,
who
--
the
bondholder
who
had
secured
a
benefit
for
all
the
bondholders,
had,
while
not
a
trustee,
had
acted
the
part
of
a
trustee.
and
it
was
a
well-settled
principle
of
trust
law
both
then
and
now
that
a
trustee
is
entitled
to
reimbursement
for
reasonable
expenses
from
the
trust
itself.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
there
was
no
agreement
in
greenough
that
contradicted
that.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
there
are
two
answers,
justice
scalia.
one
is
that
a
plan
can't
add
to
or
subtract
from
the
powers
of
the
court
in
equity
under
section
502(a)(3).
a
plan
couldn't
disclaim
a
claimant's
ability
to
get
an
injunction--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--the
powers
to
enforce--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--but
we
don't
think--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--no,
we
are
saying
that
section
502(a)(3)
takes
the
settled
powers
of
the
court
in
equity
as
it
finds
them.
and
the
plan
can't
divest
the
court
of
those
powers,
it
can't
add
to
those
powers
like
this
court
held
in
great-west;
it
also
can't
take
away
from
them.
but
if
i
could
go
to
an
equity
answer,
because
i
think
this
is
important--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--not
on
general
unfairness
grounds,
but
it
was
a
settled
principle
at
trust
law,
and
remember,
greenough
based
the
common
fund
doctrine
on
trust
law
that
if,
for
instance,
a
trust
document
had
said,
the
trustee
shall
take
his
expenses
from
the
trust
corpus,
not
from
the
income
--
or
vice-versa,
says
the
trustee
shall
take
his
expenses
from
the
income
but
not
from
the
trust
corpus
--
if
that
proved
unworkable
or
unfair
and
the
trustee
couldn't
discharge
his
obligations
to
maintain
the
trust,
the
court
of
equity
had
broad
reformation
powers
and
was
not
bound
by
that
trust
document.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
we
do
have
a
new
secretary
under
a
new
administration.
but
that--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
law
has
changed
since
that
brief
was
filed
nearly
ten
years
ago
in
the
court's
review.
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
well,
i
apologize
for
that,
your
honor,
but
we
do
cite
in
that
footnote
the
amara
case,
and
that
is
a
key
element
to
our
position
here.
because
amara
said
that
section
502(a)(3)
incorporates
the
traditional
powers
of
the
court
at
equity.
and
it
talked
about
not
only
the
ability
to
issue
an
injunction,
but
the
ability
to
provide
for
a
surcharge
remedy,
the
ability
to
reform
contracts--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--these
cases
weren't
litigated
in
the
way
they
were
now
before
--
before
sereboff--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--and
we
think
the
court
has
all
equitable
powers
and
a
plan
term
can't
divest
the
court
of
those
equitable
powers,
so
among
those
equitable
powers
was
the
ability
to
enforce
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement
without
looking
at
inapplicable
unjust
enrichment--
mr.
joseph
r.
palmore
--well,
we
do
agree
with
respect
to
the
common
fund
doctrine,
and
we
think
that,
to
the
extent
this
court
is
willing
to
look
at
the
--
at
the
--
the
purposes
of
erisa,
that
the
position
that
we've
advanced
strikes
the
right
balance
and
in
particular
it
avoids
the
negative
recovery
scenario
that
is
a
particularly
harsh
result
of
petitioner's
position.
