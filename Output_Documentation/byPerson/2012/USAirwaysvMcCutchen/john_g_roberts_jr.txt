chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
case
11-1285,
us
airways
v.
mccutchen.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
was
the
plan
available
to
the
employee
at
any
time
before
this
litigation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
are
they
--
are
they
advised
that
they
can
ask
for
the
plan?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
palmore?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
the
position
that
the
united
states
is
advancing
today
is
different
from
the
position
that
the
united
states
previously
advanced.
you
make
their
point
in
footnote
9
of
your
brief.
you
say
that
in
prior
case,
the
secretary
of
labor
took
this
position.
and
then
you
say
that,
upon
further
reflection,
the
secretary
is
now
of
the
view
--
that
is
not
the
reason.
it
wasn't
further
reflection.
we
have
a
new
secretary
now
under
a
new
administration,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be
more
candid
for
your
office
to
tell
us
when
there
is
a
change
in
position
that
it's
not
based
on
further
reflection
of
the
secretary.
it's
not
that
the
secretary
is
now
of
the
view
--
there
has
been
a
change.
we
are
seeing
a
lot
of
that
lately.
it's
perfectly
fine
if
you
want
to
change
your
position,
but
don't
tell
us
it's
because
the
secretary
has
reviewed
the
matter
further,
the
secretary
is
now
of
the
view.
tell
us
it's
because
there
is
a
new
secretary.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
tell
us
the
law
has
changed.
don't
say
the
secretary
is
now
of
the
view.
it's
not
the
same
person.
you
cite
the
prior
secretary
by
name,
and
then
you
say,
the
secretary
is
now
of
the
view.
i
found
that
a
little
disingenuous.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
wessler.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
this
the
part
--
i
might
be
mixing
this
up
with
something
else,
but
is
this
the
part
where
he
says,
unfortunately,
the
courts
don't
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
can
--
i
want
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
the
argument
that
you've
waived,
the
--
the
--
your
argument
based
on
the
distinction
between
the
summary
of
the
plan
and
the
plan.
and
there
are
two
things
that
concern
me
about
that,
in
particular.
the
summary
of
the
plan,
which
you've
had
all
the
time,
says,
on
page
1,
"this
is
only
a
summary.
"
"complete
plan
details
are
contained
in
a
legal
plan
document.
"
"if
there
is
any
difference
between
the
information
in
the
summary
and
the
legal
plan,
the
legal
plan
document
--
the
legal
plan
document
will
govern.
"
so
when
you
had
the
summary,
you
were
on
notice
that
if
there
were
any
difference
between
it
and
the
plan,
the
plan
would
govern.
you
received
a
copy
of
the
plan
in
june
of
2012.
okay?
and
as
late
as
august
29th
of
2012,
two
and
a
half
months
afterward,
you
filed
a
joint
appendix
that
didn't
--
didn't
contain
the
provision
that
you
say
now
governs.
so
why
shouldn't
you
be
held
to
have
waived
that?
the
first
time
we
found
out
about
that
was
in
your
red
brief
that
was
filed
--
june,
july,
august,
september
--
three
months
--
october
--
four
months
after
you
had
the
plan.
so
didn't
you
waive
it?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
was
four
months
after
you
had
the
plan,
and
the
plan
was
lodged
with
us
last
week
for
the
first
time.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
problem
is
that
the
district
court
interpreted
the
plan
as
precluding
the
claim
you're
making
here.
and
your
argument
that
that's
not
true
is
based
not
on
the
summary
of
the
plan,
but
on
the
plan
itself.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
what
the
district
court
does
is
it
defers
to
the
administrator's
interpretation
of
the
plan.
so
the
district
court
found
that
the
administrator's
interpretation
was
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
so
what
your
friend
is
arguing
is
that,
well,
you
are
kind
of
stuck
with
the
district
court
interpretation,
and
you
can't,
at
the
last
minute,
argue
that
it
shouldn't
control
because
of
some
other
document.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
no,
cigna
didn't
tell
you
that.
the
plan
--
the
summary
told
you
that.
it
says
"complete
plan
details
are
in
the
legal
plan.
"
"if
there
is
any
difference
between
the
summary
and
the
plan,
the
plan
controls.
"
so
you
didn't
need
cigna
to
tell
you
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katyal,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1285,
u.s.
airways
versus
mccutchen.
