mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
reimbursement
claims
that
are
based
on
an
express
subrogation
agreement
are
subject
to
equitable
principles
of
subrogation.
in
equity,
these
claims
were
governed,
according
to
the
same
principles
that
governed
every
other
type
of
subrogation.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
your
honor,
it
is
a
subrogation
agreement.
the
claim,
however,
that
petitioners
have
pursued
here,
is
a
reimbursement
claim.
and
--
but
it's
based
on
an
express
subrogation
clause.
and
in
equity,
reimbursement
claims,
which
to
be
clear,
are
distinct
from
subrogation
claims
because
they
involve
a
suit
directly
against
the
insured
as
opposed
to
against
the
tortfeasor,
are
governed
by
the
same
principles
of
subrogation
that
equity
treated
--
equity
used
to
apply
to
all
claims
that
involved
an
insurer
who
is
seeking
to
recover
money
from
either
an
insured
or
a
tortfeasor.
and
so
we
concede,
absolutely,
your
honor,
that
the
claim
is
one
for
reimbursement
for
moneys
recovered
out
of
a
fund
obtained
by
the
insured.
but
it's
based
on
an
expressed
subrogation--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--no,
your
honor.
we
--
to
be
clear,
it
is
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
but
it
arises
within
the
doctrine
of
subrogation,
which
is
as
couch,
and
palmer,
and
other
treatises
explain,
is
an
umbrella
term
that
is
used
to
describe
all
of
the
rights
and
rules
that
govern
claims
by
insurers
for
money
back
after
they've
paid
it
out
under
a
policy.
now,
the
form
of
the
action
in
this
case
is
a
--
is
a
claim
for
reimbursement
out
of
a
fund,
but
the
mere
fact
that
that's
the
form
of
the
action,
which
in
sereboff
this
court
called
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
does
not
alter
the
underlying
rule
that
equity
courts
in
the
days
of
the
divided
bench
would
have
applied
to
the
claim.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
they
are
not
beside
the
point
for
one
reason,
and
let
me
--
let
me
explain
why.
what
the
court
actually
said
in
sereboff
was
that
the
parcel
of
equitable
defenses
accompanying
a
free-standing
claim
or
free-standing
action
for
equitable
subrogation
are
beside
the
point.
a
free-standing
action
for
equitable
subrogation
is
not
one
based
on
an
agreement.
it's
an
implied
claim,
a
claim
for
subrogation
or
reimbursement
based
on
the
mere
fact
that
the
insurer
has
paid
the
money.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
there
was,
but
what
this
court
--
there
was
absolutely
an
agreement
just
as
there
is
an
agreement
in
this
case.
what
the
--
the
distinction
the
court
drew
in
sereboff
was
it
said
that
whatever
principles
apply
to
free-standing
claims
are
beside
the
point,
because
--
precisely
because
the
claim
was
based
on
an
agreement.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
and
it's
perfectly
consistent
with
our
position,
because
we
believe
that
the
principles
in
equity
that
governed
exactly
the
kinds
of
claims
that
were
at
issue
in
sereboff
and
are
at
issue
here,
reimbursement
claims
based
on
an
express
agreement,
are
in
fact
governed
by
the
same
principles
of
unjust
enrichment.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
the
court
--
the
--
the
beneficiary,
your
honor,
in
sereboff,
argued
that
the
defenses
that
applied
to
a
--
a
freestanding
or
implied
claim
for
equitable
subrogation
should
control
the
--
the
measure
of
relief
available
in
the
case.
they
said
--
it
--
the
contract
doesn't
matter.
the
agreement
makes
no
difference.
what
the
plan
is
trying
to
obtain
here
is
a
pure,
freestanding
claim
for
subrogation.
and
--
and
look
at
all
these
great
rules
that
apply
to
that
--
to
that
kind
of
claim.
and
the
court
said,
absolutely
correctly,
in
sereboff,
whatever
those
principles
are
doesn't
matter
because
this
is
a
claim
based
on
an
agreement.
but
what
our
view
in
this
case
is--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--when
it
comes
to
the
rules
that
govern
relief,
there
is
no
difference.
the
same
principle
of
unjust
enrichment
controls,
and
it
limits
an
insurer
to
recovering
out
of
the
fund
only--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--not
so,
your
honor.
it
did
not
reach
the
question
in
sereboff
of
what
rules
apply
to
--
to
reimbursement
claims
based
on
express
agreement.
that
was
footnote
2.
the
court
said
all
we're
holding
in
sereboff
is
this
is
a--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--your
honor,
in
equity,
that
was
the
rule.
and
i'll
point
this
court's
attention
to
the
leading
treatise
on
equity.
it's
palmer's
treatise
cited
by
this
court
in
sereboff
and
in
great
west.
and
what
palmer
says,
and
he
--
he
discusses
precisely
this
claim
on
pages
473
and
474
of
his
treatise,
and
it's
cited
on
page
21
of
our
brief.
and
he
says
that,
"the
same
principle
of
unjust
enrichment
controls
claims
for
reimbursement
arising
out
of
an
express
agreement.
"
and
i'm
quoting
here--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--yes,
i'm
about
to
quote
that.
and
he
says
that
that
principle,
quote,
"should
serve
to
limit
the
effectiveness
of
contract
provisions
which
in
terms
provide
for
reimbursement
out
of
the
insured's
tort
recovery
without
regard
to
whether
or
the
extent
to
which
that
recovery
includes
medical
expense.
"
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
he
--
he
--
he
identifies
two
decisions
--
that
--
you're
correct,
your
honor
--
he
identifies
two
decisions
which
did
something
contrary
to
that
rule.
but,
in
his
view,
that
is
the
rule
that
governs
these
claims.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
because,
your
honor,
these
--
these
insurance
reimbursement
cases
arose
in
a
very
different
context
from
most
other
equitable
lien
by
agreement
cases.
and
the
core
difference
in
--
between
these
cases
and
all
22
or
--
or
more
of
the
cases
that
the
petitioner
cites
is
that
they
involve
a
third
party
who
has
caused
the
loss
both
to
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
and
that
third
party,
the
tortfeasor,
in
these
reimbursement
cases
is
not
the
defendant.
and
so,
in
two-party
equitable
lien
by
agreement
cases,
which
are
--
all
of
the
cases
that
petitioner
cites
involve
two-party
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
also
the
wrongdoer,
is
the
person
who
is
culpable
and
who
has
caused
the
--
the
plaintiff's
loss
--
in
those
cases,
when
courts
awarded
relief,
they
awarded
relief
that
was
consistent
with
the
defendant's
unjust
enrichment,
but
was
also
co-extensive
with
or
consistent
with
the
loss
under
the
contract.
in
these
three-party
cases,
however,
because
the
defendant,
who
is
--
who
is
a
beneficiary,
not
--
not
the
tortfeasor,
did
not
actually
trigger
the
loss,
courts
developed
in
equity
a
different
set
of
rules
to
apply
to
--
to
measure
the
relief
available
under
the
claim.
and
what
they
said
was,
where
there
is
a
fund
that
is
insufficient,
where
it
cannot
cover
all
of
the
losses
suffered
by
all
of
the
parties,
that
--
that
all
of
the
parties
must
share
equally
with
--
of
the
loss.
and
the
palmer
--
palmer
itself
has
an
entire
chapter
devoted
to
third-party
problems.
and--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--your
honor,
it's
unfair
because,
in
equity,
parties
could
not
defeat
the
rules
that
typically
apply.
now,
if
this
were
a
legal
case,
and
that
were
a
legal
claim,
there's
nothing
unfair
about
that.
the
parties
can
structure
their
contracts
or
agreements
as
they
see
fit.
but
the
fact
is
that
we
are
talking
about
the
rules
that
equity
applied
in
these
situations.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
right.
and
i
would
point
the
court
to
--
to
its
decision
in
mckee
in
1935,
in
which
it
drew
a
distinction
between
a
claim
in
equity
that
was
a
legal
claim
based
on
a
contract,
which
could
happen,
and
a
claim
in
equity
that
was
a,
quote,
“
purely
equitable
claim
”
based
on
the
contract.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
it
--
it
could
be
either,
your
honor.
and
we've
cited
--
cited
to
this
court
cases
in
--
in
the
days
of
the
divided
bench
in
which
a
party
could
have
sought
legal
relief
for
breach
for
this
exact
kind
of
claim,
but
there
was
also
a
remedy
that
a
party
could
seek
in
equity.
but
in
order
to
do
that,
in
order
to
--
to
enter
equity's
doors
on
this
reimbursement
theory,
it
--
it
had
to
agree
to
allow
other
parties
their
correlative
rights
in
equity,
and
it
also
had
to
agree
not
to
override
or
defeat
the
--
the
rules
in
equity
that
typically
would--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--no,
your
honor.
the
plan
is
in
a
bind
here.
and
we
know
this
from
sereboff
and
great
west
and
mertens.
they
cannot
seek
legal
relief
under
this
contract.
the
only
--
the
only
provision
in
erisa's
enforcement
section
that
allows
that
is
section
502(a)(1)(b),
and
it
says
a
party
has
rights
to
--
has
the
right
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
plan;
but
--
but
fiduciaries
like
petitioner
are
not
allowed
to
pursue
relief
under
that
provision,
so
all
they
get
is
purely
equitable
relief
under
502(a)(3).
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
your
honor--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--and
there
were
--
there
were
exceptions,
but
we
don't
view
this
case
as
a
specific
performance
case.
and
i'm
not
sure
petitioner--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--as
a
specific
performance
case.
that
was
a
specific
type
of
--
of
remedy.
the
remedy
here
that's
being
sought
is
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement,
but
--
but
in
our
view,
when
an
insurer
sought
to
enforce
through
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement
a
claim
or
a
lien
on
a
fund,
it
must
agree
to
take
that
relief
subject
to
the
way
equity
would
have
treated
the
claim.
and
what
palmer
and
what
couch
and
--
and
what
the
cases
we've
cited
say
is
that
even
for
those
reimbursement
claims
that
are
based
or
arise
on
an
express
agreement,
that
the
relief
available
is
limited
in
two
concrete
ways.
the
--
the
insurer
could
not
get
more
out
of
the
fund
than
its
share
of
the
fund
that
accounted
for
the
medical
expenses
it
paid,
and
it
must
have
agreed
to
reduce
proportionately
for
an
amount
of
fees
and
costs.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
the
svea
case,
your
honor,
which
is--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--well,
your
honor,
to
be
clear,
there
is
not
a
single
equitable
lien
case
that
--
that
petitioners
have
found
in
which
a
court
has--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--so
--
so,
your
honor,
the
svea
case,
is
--
is,
i
think,
our
best
example.
and
in
that
case,
the
insurer
had
a
subrogation
agreement
which
authorized
it
to
recover
--
authorized
recovery
to,
quote,
“
the
extent
of
its
payment
”
out
of,
quote,
"all
rights
of
recovery
of
the
insured.
"
and
in
that
case,
there
was
an
underlying
settlement
that
the
insured
reached
with
the
tortfeasor,
the
wrongdoer.
and
after
that
occurred,
the
insurer
did
not
participate
in
that
underlying
proceeding
at
all.
and
after
that
occurred,
the
insurer
then
directly
sued
the
insured.
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
case
we're
talking
about
here,
seeking
recovery
out
of
the
fund.
and
they
based
that
claim
on
their
--
on
their
express
subrogation
agreement.
and
they
said,
we
paid
approximately
$3,000.
you
recovered
something
like
$9,000.
we
should
get
$3,000
back.
and
the
court
there
said
no,
because
the
fund
was
insufficient
to
cover
all
of
the
losses
--
the
--
the
insured
did
not
recover
for
all
of
its
losses,
several
other
claimants
did
not
recover
for
all
of
their
losses
--
and
the
court
said
that
because
the
fund
was
insufficient,
the
--
the
insurer
was
limited
to
recovering
--
and
i'm
quoting
here
--
"no
more
than
its
proportion
of
the
amount
recovered
after
deducting
costs
and
fees.
"
and
so
they
applied
both
the
double
recovery
cap
that
we
believe
applied
in
every
single
case
in
equity
in
which
an
insurer--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--this
is
the
svea
case,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
the
highest
court
in
maryland,
i
believe
from
1901.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
did
not
arise
that
frequently
in
courts
of
equity.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
be
--
for
--
for
several
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
most
of
these
claims
arose
simply
as
freestanding
or
implied
claims.
so
there
was
not
--
there
was
no
need
for
an
insurer
to
include
in
its
insurance
policy
an
expressed
subrogation
agreement.
however,
that
--
that
changed
approximately
around
the
turn
--
the
mid-20th
century
when
medical
insurance
started
to
become
an
increasing
commodity.
when
that
occurred,
most
states
had
a
--
a
prohibition
on
the
assignment
of
personal
injury
claims.
and
so
what
insurers
began
to
do
to
get
around
that
prohibition
was
to
insert
in
their
--
in
their
policies
an
express
clause
allowing
them
to
obtain
reimbursement
from
the
insured
in
the
event
that
the
insured
recovered
money
that
it
had
paid.
now,
there
is
another
reason
in
this
case
--
or
in
these
erisa
cases
--
why
these
agreements
need
to
be
in
the
plan,
and
that's
because
section
502(a)(3)
itself
does
not
allow
for
a
plan,
like
petitioner,
to
obtain
a
general
right
to
equitable
relief.
all
that
the
petitioner
can
--
can
seek
here
is
equitable
--
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
enforce
the
terms
of
its
plan.
and
so
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
provision,
like
a
subrogation
clause,
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
pursue
a
--
a
general
right
to
subrogation.
it's
a
term
--
that
back-end
reference
is
a
--
is
a
term
of
limitation
that
limits
the
types
of
claims
that
petitioner
can
bring
in
these
cases.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
we
waived
it,
your
honor.
it's
in
our
opening
brief
on
the
merits
to
this
court,
and--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
our
view
--
and
--
and
i
think
i
need
to
be
clear
about
this.
i
mean,
the
--
the
fact
that
the
plan
contains
a
different
set
of
rights
than
--
than
the
spd,
to
us,
is
meaningful
in
--
in
its
--
in
its
effect
that
it
will
have
on
this
case
when
this
--
if
and
when
this
court
remands
because
--
because,
in
our
view,
the
rights
are
different.
however,
i
--
it
doesn't
change
the
underlying
nature
of
our
argument,
which
is
that
even
the
strong
form
argument
that
petitioners
have
made
here,
which
is
that,
on
the
spd,
it
can
defeat
the
--
the
rules
that
typically
would
have
applied,
that
equity
would
not
have
allowed
that.
and
so--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--that--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--well
--
well,
we
think
we
do
have
the
right
to
argue
that
on
remand,
your
honor.
and
--
and
this
court's
decision
in
cigna
only
--
only
arose
in
this
case
after
the
--
the
briefs
were
complete
to
the
third
circuit.
and
so
it's
--
i
--
i
think
cigna
has
changed
the
law
to
the
extent
that
all
parties
are
now
on
notice
and
know
that
the
plan
document
will
trump
any
contrary
language--
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
--well
--
well,
your
--
your
honor,
i
mean,
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
you
know,
that
--
for
us,
that's
an
issue
on
remand.
we're
comfortable
that
our
arguments
in
this
case
control
even
--
even
as
it
relates
to
the
actual
language
in
the
spd,
and
that
--
and
that
whatever
differences
between
the
spd
and
the
plan
actually
are
don't
necessarily
change
the
rules
that
govern
when
a
--
when
a
party
in
equity
sought
this
kind
of
reimbursement
relief
directly
from
--
from
an
insured.
i'd
like,
just
--
just
for
the
last
minute
or
so,
to
discuss
the
common
fund
rule
because
i
do
think
it
applies
as
a
separate
and
distinct
rule,
regardless
of
how
this
court
interprets
the
agreement
as
governing
the
rights
between
mr.
mccutchen,
the
beneficiary,
and
the
plan.
and
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
in
pettus
made
clear
that
the
common
fund
doctrine
confers
a
separate
lien
on
the
attorney.
and
so
whatever
the
agreement
control
between
the
beneficiary
and
the
plan
has,
it
cannot
defeat
the
rights
that
the
attorney
has,
as
a
separate
matter,
to
come
into
court
and
invoke
its
own
lien
on
the
fund
as
a
first
priority
lien
over
the
money.
and
--
and
i
--
and
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
petitioners
have
not
responded
to
that
argument.
nowhere
in
their
reply
brief
did
they
explain
why
their
theory
would
allow
them
to
defeat
the
rights
of
a
third-party
defendant
in
this
case,
mr.
mccutchen's
lawyers,
who
have
their
own
separate
right
to
the
lien.
and
--
and
none
of
their
equitable
lien
cases,
your
honor,
involve
any
kind
of
common
fund
whatsoever.
so
they
say
precisely
nothing
about
the
rules
that
would
have
applied
in
equity
to
an
attorney's
attempt
to
--
to
take
their
proportion
out
of
the
fund
before
it
was
distributed
to
any
of
the
parties.
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
the
common
fund,
your
honor,
applies
either
to
deduct
--
either
as
a
deduction
off
the
--
your
honor,
may
i
--
may
i
finish
answering
the
question?
mr.
matthew
w.h.
wessler
as
a
deduction
out
of
the
entire
fund
for
the
attorney's
lien,
or
it
can
be
applied
to
reduce
proportionately
each
of
the
claimant's
claims
to
that
fund.
and
in
this
case,
it
should
be
applied
to
reduce
petitioner's
claim
on
the
fund,
irrespective
of
mccutchen's
own
claim.
thank
you,
your
honor.
