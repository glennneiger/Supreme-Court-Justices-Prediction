justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
are
you
in
effect
asking
for
a
windfall
because
mr.
mccutchen
and
his
attorneys
didn't
understand
what
erisa
means
in
this
context?
if
they
understood
that
things
would
work
out
the
way
you
think
they
should
work
out,
and
they
saw
that
the
limits
of
the
insurance
policies
against
which
they
could
collect
were
$110,000,
wouldn't
they
have
realized
that
this
was
a
suit
that
wasn't
worth
pursuing?
there
would
be
no
point
in
doing
it
because
nothing
would
be
--
nothing
would
be
gained
for
mr.
mccutchen
or
for
the
attorneys.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
perhaps
they
should
have
realized
it;
but,
if
they
realized
it,
they
have
no
incentive
to
pursue
this
litigation
or
to
pursue
the
tort
decision--
