justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
katyal,
could
i
ask
you
about
the
legal
argument
that
you
are
making,
the
distinction
you
are
making
between
reimbursement
agreements
and
subrogation
agreements,
which
you
think
--
seem
to
think
is
critical
here.
and,
you
know,
once
you
put
it
in
one
box
rather
than
another,
some
result
follows,
different
results
follow.
justice
elena
kagan
so
--
so
how
do
you
know
whether
you
have
a
reimbursement
agreement
or
a
subrogation
agreement
and
what
follows
from
that
categorization?
justice
elena
kagan
so
if
this
were
a
subrogation
agreement,
what
would
follow?
justice
elena
kagan
so
if
your
friend's
argument
would
get
a
lot
stronger
if
it
were
a
subrogation
agreement,
how
do
we
tell
that
this
agreement
is
a
reimbursement
agreement
rather
than
--
are
we
supposed
to
just
take
that
because
that's
the
way
the
court
--
it's
come
to
us,
or
--
or
is
there
an
argument
about
why
there
is
a
reimbursement?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
palmore,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
katyal's
view
of
this
distinction
between
subjugation
--
subrogation
agreements
and
reimbursement
agreements
and
which
this
agreement
is?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
but
i
think
mr.
katyal
said
that
if
this
were
a
subrogation
agreement,
mr.
mccutchen
would
have
a
much
better
argument
because
a
different
set
of
rules
would
apply.
and
so
that
makes
this
categorization
question
quite
meaningful.
now,
you
could
say,
well,
we
don't
see
it
as
all
that
meaningful.
we
think,
no
matter
what
you
call
this
agreement,
the
same
rules
apply.
or
you
could
say,
yes,
different
rules
apply
with
respect
to
these
two
different
kinds
of
agreements,
and
your
job
is
to
figure
out
which
kind
of
agreement
this
is.
justice
elena
kagan
but
doesn't
sereboff
suggest
not?
i
mean,
i
realize
that
sereboff
has
this
footnote,
but
if
you
read
the
text
in
sereboff,
it
says
"these
affirmative
defenses
that
would
arise.
"
in
a
normal
subrogation
context
are
beside
the
point.
so
how
are
they
not
the
beside
the
point?
justice
elena
kagan
so
is
that
true
that
in
sereboff
there
was
no
agreement?
justice
elena
kagan
i
guess
i
don't
understand
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
when
sereboff
said
it
was
beside
the
point,
they
were
refuting
the
argument
that
the
insured
party
was
making,
that
the
insured
party
was
saying,
hey,
look,
we
have
these
great
defenses.
and
you
are
saying
they
had
an
agreement
but
they
also
said
they
have
these
great
defenses,
and
the
court
said,
too
bad,
those
defenses
don't
work
for
you
here.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
wessler,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
--
i
mean,
we're
in
this
unusual
position
because
we're
supposed
to
be
looking
back
to
before
the
1930s
sometime.
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
we
just
don't
have
very
many
cases,
and
mr.
katyal
doesn't
have
any,
and
you
don't
have
any,
that
raise
this
question
that
where
somebody
walks
into
an
equity
court
with
a
contract,
and
we
try
to
figure
out
whether
the
equity
court
is
going
to
use
these
unjust
enrichment
defenses?
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
we
just
don't
know?
justice
elena
kagan
why
didn't
it?
justice
elena
kagan
james
mccutchen
received
health
benefits
through
a
plan
established
by
his
employer,
us
airways.
when
mccutchen
was
injured
in
a
car
accident
caused
by
a
negligent
driver,
us
airways
paid
his
medical
bills
as
the
plan
provided.
sometime
later,
mccutchen
sued
the
other
driver
and
secured
a
modest
recovery.
us
airways
demanded
reimbursement
from
that
recovery
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
plan.
mccutchen
refused.
so,
us
airways
filed
suit
asking
for
a
lien
on
the
funds
he
had
obtained.
us
airways
relied
on
section
502(a)(3)
of
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
called
erisa,
which
allows
health-plan
administrators
to
seek
what's
called
appropriate
equitable
relief
to
enforce
their
plans.
the
question
here
is
whether
mccutchen
can
raise
either
of
two
equitable
defenses
to
us
airways
suit.
one,
would
limit
us
airways'
claim
to
the
amount
mccutchen
received
for
medical
expenses
and
let
him
keep
all
the
money
he
got
for
his
pain
and
suffering
or
other
kinds
of
loss.
the
other,
which
is
called
the
common
fund
doctrine,
would
require
u.s.
airways
at
least
to
pay
a
fair
share
of
the
attorney's
fees
that
mccutchen
expended
to
obtain
his
recovery.
mccutchen
contends
that
those
defenses
apply,
irrespective
of
whether
us
airways
plan,
which
is
a
kind
of
contract
provides
otherwise.
the
third
circuit
agreed.
today,
we
vacate
that
decision
in
an
opinion
that
has
two
parts
-
one,
favoring
us
airways
and
the
other,
mccutchen.
we
have
held
in
the
past
that
a
health
plan
administrator
can
sue
to
enforce
a
reimbursement
clause
in
its
plan
under
erisa's
section
502(a)(3).
we
reasoned
then
that
such
a
suit
sought
equitable
relief
as
the
statute
requires,
because
it
demands
something
called
an
equitable
lien
by
agreement.
that's
a
--
that's
a
fancy
name
for
a
fairly
simple
idea.
the
beneficiary
has
made
a
contract
to
reimburse
the
health
plan
administrator
and
equity,
therefore,
imposes
a
lien
on
the
money
he
agreed
to
turn
over.
we
think
it
follows
that
in
a
suit
like
this
one,
the
plain
terms
of
the
contract
controlled.
mccutchen's
equitable
defenses
cannot
override
them.
as
i'd
just
said,
the
equitable
lien
by
agreement
that
us
airways
seeks
to
enforce
is
a
creature
of
contract.
it
arises
from
the
party's
agreement
and
serves
to
carry
it
out.
enforcing
that
kind
of
contract
based
lien,
means
holding
the
parties
to
their
mutual
promises
and
conversely,
it
means
declining
to
apply
principles
that
are
at
odds
with
the
parties
expressed
commitments.
so,
us
airways
is
right
that
the
contract
governs.
but
mccutchen's
arguments
are
not
all
for
nothing.
even
if
equitable
principles
of
the
kind
he
raises
cannot
trump
a
contract,
they
may
aid
in
properly
construing
it.
erisa
plans
like
other
contracts
don't
always
speak
clearly.
sometimes
they
leave
gaps,
and
when
that
happens,
courts
routinely
consider
background
legal
principles
to
fill
in
the
contract.
here,
us
airways
plan
is
silent
on
how
to
allocate
attorney's
fees,
and
in
that
circumstance,
the
common
fund
doctrine
provides
the
appropriate
default
rule.
we
discussed
in
the
opinion
why
that
is
so,
how
well
established
the
rule
is
and
how
strong
the
basis
for
it.
without
any
sharing
of
attorney's
fees,
a
health
plan
administrator
would
free
ride
on
a
beneficiary's
efforts
getting
all
its
money
back
while
contributing
nothing
to
the
costs
of
obtaining
the
recovery,
and
possibly,
as
in
this
case,
leaving
the
beneficiary
worse
off
than
if
he
had
not
sought
the
recovery
in
the
first
instance.
we
do
not
think
that
a
contracting
party
would
expect
or
intend
a
plan
that
does
not
address
attorney's
fees
to
negate
the
equitable
principle
preventing
this
result.
and
we,
therefore,
read
us
airways
plan
to
incorporate
the
common
fund
doctrine.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
thomas
and
alito
joined.
