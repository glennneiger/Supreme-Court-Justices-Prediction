mr.
katyal,
if
you
go
to
equity,
why
aren't
you
bound
by
equity?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
but
that's
exactly
what
your
bottom
line
is,
which
is,
you
have
someone
else
do
the
work
for
you,
and
you
don't
pay
them.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
does
your
lien
have
priority
to
the
attorney's
lien
that
is
normally
created
at
the
commencement
of
the
litigation?
why
is
the
attorney
bound
by
the
agreement
you
signed
with
the
beneficiary?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
are
you
conceding--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
plan
doesn't
say
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
sorry,
the
phrase
that
you
just
read
says
that
the
benefits
are
the
same.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
reimbursement
and
subrogation
language
are
the
same.
so
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
and
point
out
in
the
plan
what
words
you're
relying
upon.
not
the
summary,
but
the
plan.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
thought
it
took
most
of
the
litigation
for
the
plan
to
be
provided.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
in
this
case,
he
wrote
--
the
attorney
wrote
to
you
any
number
of
times,
and
finally
said,
look,
unless
you
come
and
tell
me
what
your
position
is,
i'm
going
to
go
forward.
so
what
are
attorneys
supposed
to
do
in
those
situations,
just
drop
the
lawsuit?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
rejected
it
because
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
agreement,
but
it
didn't
reject
them
as
a
factual
matter,
that
you
were
contacted.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
were
they
supposed
to
--
if
the
insurance
limit
was
$100,000,
are
you
suggesting
that
that
was
a
bad
faith
settlement?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--or
not
to
enforce
it.
meaning
the
equity
is
to
enforce
it
or
to
stay
your
hand.
and
so
the
court
could
decide
not
to
reach
into
the
pocket
of
the
plan
participant
to
pay
back
money
that
the
lawyer
has.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
--
what's
the
difference
between
the
two?
meaning,
i
take
your
argument
to
be
that
the
court
was
right
before
that
freestanding
subrogation
claims
have
one
set
of
remedies
or
rights,
and
subrogation,
by
agreement,
have
another.
so
what
do
you
see
as
the
differences
between
the
two?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
was
the
court
in
an
exercise
of
futility
in
writing
what
it
did
in
sereboff?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
understand
the
argument.
it's
a
bit
unsettling
that
you've
got
two
kinds
of
rights,
one
implied
and
one
express,
and
there's
no
difference
between
the
two?
you
--
you've
got
to
give
them
a
little
bit
more
body
to
have
a
persuasive
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
there
another
line
after
that,
that
says
something--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
put
on
the
back
of
someone
else,
meaning--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
may
or
may
not
agree
that
in
terms
of
your
split
with
the
participant,
the
contract
might
control.
but
i
still
am
having
trouble
with
understanding
how
you
can
bind
a
third
party
like
a
lawyer,
who's
done
the
effort
to
recover
that
fund
--
more
along
justice
breyer's
question,
which
is,
not
only
in
--
in
all
equity,
lawyers
are
entitled,
whether
by
contract
or
by
unjust
enrichment
principles,
to
a
--
to
a
percentage
of
their
expenses
in
recovering
something.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i'm
assuming,
because
erisa's
in
place
now,
that
the
many
state
laws
that
prohibit
this
kind
of
agreement
where
insurance
plans
are
seeking
full
reimbursement
despite
an
attorney's
efforts,
that
those
are
void,
that
those
would
be
enforceable.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
only
one
who
can
fix
this
problem
now
is
congress,
if
they--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--perceive
it
as
a
problem.
