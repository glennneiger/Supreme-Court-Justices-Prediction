with
sereboff,
that
you
--
you
referred
to,
that
--
that
certainly
describes
the
lien
you
rely
on,
but
there's
a
footnote
toward
the
end
that
leaves
open
the
make-whole
doctrine
and,
i
assume,
also
the
common
fund
doctrine.
so
--
so
it's
--
it's
an
open
question.
justice

where
is
that
abrogation
--
where
is
that
abrogation
in
this
--
not
the
plan
description,
but
the
plan
itself
--
what
clear
language
in
the
plan
bars
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
asking
about
the
plan
itself
because
the
plan
controls
if
there's
a
discrepancy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
--
and
i
don't
--
you
--
you
make
a
distinction
between
reimbursement
clause
and
the
subrogation
clause.
and
this
--
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
plan,
there
is
no
reimbursement
clause.
the
only
one
that's
there
is
labeled
“
subrogation
”.
and
i
looked
at
what's
in
the
plan,
and
i
don't
see
language
that
clearly
abrogates
the
common
fund.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
go
back
to
what
the
--
the
simple
argument.
we
have
an
agreement
here,
and
the
plan
is
asking
for
what
the
agreement
gives
it.
why
is
the
plan
unjustly
enriched
by
receiving
exactly
what
the
plan
entitles
it
to
receive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
couldn't
that
party
simply
say,
i
want
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
court?
you
just
made
a
distinction
between
the
remedy
at
law
and
at
equity.
this
is
the
plan,
and
if
the
plan
is
told,
well,
if
you
go
to
equity,
you
get
all
these
extra
things,
you
could
say,
i'm
asserting
my
rights
at
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
discussing
the
common
fund
would
be
the
allocation
between
mccutchen
and
the
plan,
but
now
you
seem
to
be
talking
only
about
the
attorney's
right
to
come
in
first.
