justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
--
i
recognize
that
we're
talking
about
a
matter
of
federal
law
here.
what
about
the
law
of
most
of
the
states?
suppose
there's
an
agreement
with
an
insurer
and
an
insured
that
says
the
insured
gets
100
percent
of
the
proceeds.
i
would
think
that
the
law
of
most
states
gives
a
superior
lien
to
the
attorney
for
the
contingent
fee,
notwithstanding
the
agreement.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
it's
just
an
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
--
that's
the
summary
of
the
plan
that's
at
820.
that's
not
the
plan--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
i
mean,
you
--
you
want
us
to
decide
a
case
without
looking
at
the
plan?
i
have
before
me
the
same
language
that
i
believe
justice
ginsburg
is
looking
at,
and
i
think
she's
quite
correct.
the
word
“
abrogation
”,
of
course,
is
not
used,
but
neither
is
the
concept.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
simply
because
of
plan
language.
i
mean,
obviously,
we
have
to
look
at
the
plan
language
to
see
what
the
--
you're
--
you're
relying
on
the
plan
language.
and
you
cite
the
summary,
but
you
don't
cite
the
main
plan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
kagan's
question
had
two
parts.
she
said,
tell
me
about
the
two
boxes,
subrogation
and
reimbursement.
i
think
there
is
quite
a
bit
to
your
argument
that
this
is
not
subrogation.
the
plan
is
rather
confusingly
drafted.
the
plan
calls
it
subrogation.
i
don't
think
it
really
means
subrogation.
if
it's
not
subrogation,
justice
kagan's
question
was,
what
then?
the
--
the
common
fund
rule
still
does
not
apply?
because?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
are
still
in
equity
pursuant
to
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
are
you
saying
that
there
is
no
discretion
in
the
equitable
decrees
that
the
judge
made?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
general
rule
in
equity
was
that
the
equity
court
would
not
give
a
specific
performance
decree
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
money
was
the
general
rule.
were
there
exceptions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
--
and
if
so,
do
those
exceptions
bear
on
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
--
you
don't
view
the
case
as?
