justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
would
you
define
the
duty
that
new
hampshire
imposed
here
according
to
the
first
circuit
and
according
to
the
respondent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
me
to
write
down
in
this
case,
from
my
understanding,
that
under
new
hampshire
law,
strict
liability
is
determined
quite
without
reference
to
the
adequacy
of
warning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
wait.
what's
--
what's
a
factor?
the
warning
is
or
is
not
a
factor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
--
that's
not
the
thrust
of
your
argument.
and
i
think
it
was
a
factor
here
for
some
of
the
reasons
justice
kagan
has
suggested.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
which
does
--
was
the
warning
relevant
or
not
relevant
to
the
determination
of
strict
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
the
definition
of
the
duty.
was
it
permissible
for
the
jury
to
define
the
duty
here
and
the
breach
of
the
duty
in
part
by
--
by
reference
to
the
adequacy
of
the
warning?
and
i
--
i
now
understand
your
answer
to
be
yes.
