mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
questions
that
you
and
justice
alito
posed
about
state
law,
because
it's
important
to
understand,
before
you
have
impossibility
conflict
preemption,
to
understand
what
the
state
duty
is
here.
i
think
it
was
conceded
that
it
would
not
be
impossible
to
have
an
absolute
liability
regime.
so
the
question
here
is:
because
new
hampshire
actually
makes
it
somewhat
easier
for
manufacturers
to
evade
liability,
that
that
somehow
creates
a
different
kind
of
preemption
problem.
we
would
submit
that
it
doesn't.
what
the
state
law
is
seeking
to
do
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
to
impose
liability
where
there
is
proof
of
an
unreasonably
dangerous
product.
that
unreasonable
danger
entails
evidence
of
a
risk/benefit
analysis
that
looks
at
the
overall
risks
to
the
population
against
the
overall
benefits
that
are
provided
for
the
drug.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
it
is.
and
notably,
the
fdca
doesn't
preclude
that.
wyeth
v.
levine
affirms
that
principle.
and
what's
important
here
is
that
under
state
law,
there's
not
a
duty
to
change
the
design
or
to
change
the
label.
it
is,
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
exactly
as
you
postulated,
that
if
there
is
an
unreasonably
dangerous
drug,
that
the
people
that
are
harmed
egregiously,
like
karen
bartlett,
will
have
an
opportunity
to
compensate
them--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
mutual
put
in
their
defense
in
this
case
--
they
rested
after
the
plaintiffs
put
in
their
case.
so
it's
not
to
say
that
in
another
case,
they
wouldn't
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
there
is
some
benefit
of
their
drug.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
there's
no
claim
preclusion
effect
of
a
jury
verdict,
and
that
is
why
there
is
no
offensive
collateral
estoppel
that
would
be
applied,
mutual
can
adopt
a
different
trial
strategy.
it
is
often
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
the
defense
applies
different
tactics
to
how
they
defend
this
case.
in
this
particular
case,
they
chose
to
waive
their
comment
k
affirmative
defense.
they
chose
not
to
put
in
any
affirmative
evidence
itself.
they
chose
after
the
trial
in
their
rule
50
motion
for
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
not
to
challenge
the
warning
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
jury
--
as
judge
boudin
noted
and
as
the
district
court
noted
--
they
had
waived
their
preemption
warning
argument.
and
so
what
they
seek
to
do
here
after
not
being
able
to
show
--
which
they
cannot
show
under
new
hampshire
supreme
court
precedent
--
vautour
and
kelleher
--
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
brief,
that
new
hampshire
imposes
any
duty
to
change
any
conduct
by
the
manufacturer
whatsoever.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
let
me
address
that,
because
i
think
that's
the
hardest
part
of
this
case
to
understand,
and
why
this
is
different
from
mensing.
in
a
strict
liability
case
in
new
hampshire,
the
warning
is
not
relevant
as
a
--
as
an
element
of
the
claim.
what
the
jury
is
required
as
an
element
of
the
claim
is
to
prove
unreasonable
dangerousness.
and
district
judge
la
plant,
who
presided
over
this
very
complex
and
difficult
trial
with
a
lot
of
skill,
understood
the
difference
between
the
concept
of
adequacy
of
a
warning
which
describes
the
risks
and
efficacy
of
the
warning
which
limits
or
minimizes
the
risks.
and
all
over
the
pretrial
instructions,
he
made
very
clear
to
the
counsel,
you
are
not
to
argue
about
adequacy
of
the
warning,
because
that
goes
to
the
comment
k
defense
that
they
waived
on
the
eve
of
trial.
instead,
once
the
jury
finds
that
the
drug
is
unreasonably
dangerous,
it
may
use
the
warning
as
a
way
to
limit
or
minimize
the
risk.
in
other
words,
the
warning
could
only
benefit
mutual,
because
liability
was
going
to
be
found
in
spite
of
the
warning
and
not
because
of
the
warning.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
not.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
absolutely
not.
justice
breyer.
the
evidence
here
was
clear.
no
warning
would
have
made
any
difference
to
lessening
the
risk.
and
that
is
because,
and
this
is
on--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--all
that
they
--
in
terms
of
minimizing
the
risk.
justice
breyer,
here--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
case
as
it
was
litigated
up
until
the
day
before
the
trial
was
with
a
comment
k
defense,
which
allows
as
an
affirmative
defense
the
defendant
to
say
if
the
drug
is
unavoidably
unsafe
and
it
has
an
adequate
warning,
i.e.,
it
adequately
describes
what
the
risks
are,
complete
immunity
from
suit.
they
abandoned
that
comment
k
defense
on
the
eve
of
trial.
and
so
as
the
judge
understood
and
instructed
the
jury,
the
only
role
that
the
warning
actually
played
was
whether
it
could
lessen
the
risk
to
patients
who
took
the
drug,
i.e.,
in
the
risk/benefit
analysis,
it's
somewhat
less
risky
in
weighing
it
against
the
benefits.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
as
the
le
blanc
case
held
in
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
the
new
hampshire
law
treats
failure
to
warn
cases
as
distinct
from
design-defect
cases.
here,
no
words
would
have
made
any
difference
because
the
scientific--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
where
is
it
in
the
record?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
would
direct
you
to
two--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--two
pieces.
the
jmol
order
that
the
judge
issued,
which
is
in
the
petition
appendix,
goes
through
this
very
clearly.
and
judge
le
plant
understood
how
the
different
roles
of
warning
apply,
and
he
instructed
the
jury,
and
this
is
in
the
pre-formal
colloquy
that
he's
giving
to
the
jury
orally,
you
can
find
this
at
496
of
the
joint
appendix
where
he
says,
"adequacy
is
not
an
issue
for
--
the
adequacy
of
the
warning
is
not
an
issue
for
you
to
decide.
"
he
then
goes
further
to
explain
that
"you
will
only
consider
the
warning
after
you
have
considered
the
unreasonable
danger.
"
--that's
at
513
to
514,
and
then
on
page
516
of
the
joint
appendix,
he
says,
"you
only
consider
the
warning
to
minimize
the
risk.
"
i.e.,
to
benefit
mutual
in
the
assessment
of
whether
or
not
in
a
risk/benefit
analysis
this
drug
has
greater
risks
than--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
breyer,
a
chemotherapy
drug
has
got
a
huge
benefit.
it
potentially
saves
you
from
cancer.
a
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drug,
of
which
there
were
16
other
types,
is
not
at
all
analogous
to
a
chemotherapy
drug.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
but
that's
why
when
the
jury
gets
evidence
that
aspirin
and
acetaminophen,
tylenol
produce
the
same
kind
of
pain
relief,
but
they
do
not
produce
the
kind
of
sjs/10
that
ms.
bartlett
--
that
caused
60
percent
of
her
body
to
burn.
i
mean,
that
gives
you
a
very
clear
contrast.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
because
the
evidence
at
the
time
of
approval
had
not
yet
been
ascertained.
what
was
clear
from
the
unpublished
pharmacia
report
that
went
into
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
between
the
time
of
1980
and
1997,
the
adjusted
reporting
rate
of
these
adverse
incidents
went
very
high,
and
it
was
of
a
rate
that
was
comparable
to
bextra,
which
went
on
the
market
several
years
after
that
study
ended,
in
which
the
fda,
in
looking
at
a
comparable
adjusted
adverse
reporting
rate,
concluded
should
be
taken
off
the
market.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
true,
but
what
the
fda
did
not
take
into
account,
and
this
is
what
the
district
judge
instructed
the
jury
on
september
22nd,
2010,
i
think
it's
page
108
in
the
charging
colloquy,
is
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
the
fda
did
not
have
that
evidence.
so
what
the
solicitor
general
seeks
to
argue
here
is
evidence
that
was
not
in
the
record
and
in
which
mutual's
own
expert
who
created
this
evidence
testified
in
deposition
he
didn't
give
it
to
the
fda.
and
then
mutual
never
put
him
on
the
stand
to
be
cross
examined.
and
so
now
what
we
have
is
a
trial
record
that
shows
this
evidence
was
not
given
to
the
fda
at
all.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
is
incorrect.
that
the
fda,
if
it
considered
it,
there
is
no
record
of
it
doing
so
because
in
the
response
to
the
2005
citizen
petition
and
in
a
later
memorandum,
it
never
mentions
sulindac.
so
if
you
are
to
take
any
kind
of
regulatory
preemption
here,
it
surely
has
to
be
on
the
basis
of
a
considered
action
that
the
fda
takes
after
notice
and
comment
rulemaking.
that
was
the
kind
of
standard
that
was
advocated
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
wyeth
v.
levine,
that
is
absent
here.
and,
in
fact,
this
case
has
even
a
weaker
case
for
that
kind
of
considered
and
rejected
than
in
levine
itself
where
there
was
evidence
that
phenergan
had
caused
some
arterial
exposure.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
you
can
do
that.
yes,
justice
kennedy,
you
can
do
that.
it
is
a
factor
for
the
jury
to
consider.
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
claim.
and
what
pliva
makes
clear--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--the
warning
can
be
a
factor.
what
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
justice
kennedy--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
it
was
relevant
as
in
this
case.
but,
justice
kennedy,
if
you
were
to
take
the
position
that
mere
evidence
that
is
a
factor
for
the
jury
to
consider,
even
though
there
is
no
need
to
change
any
legal
duty,
you
would
be
adopting
field
preemption
under
this
statute,
because
the
whole
thrust
of
pliva--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
and
let's
be
clear
on
our
nomenclature
here.
a
duty
is
a
legal
requirement
imposed
under
state
common
law,
a
duty
to
use
due
care,
a
duty
to
change
the
label,
which
is
what
was
conceded
in
pliva
and
mensing.
here
new
hampshire
law
does
not
require
a
duty
to
change
the
label
or
to
change
the
design.
all
it
does,
justice
kennedy,
is
to
say,
if
the
jury
finds
that
the
risks
outweigh
the
benefits,
it
may
consider
whether
the
warning
would
have
lessened
the
risk.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
when
there
is
a
comment
k
defense,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
may
be
off
completely.
and
that's
why
the
role
of
comment
k
is
so
critical
in
these
strict
liability
claims.
all--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--there
is
a
difference,
and
the
difference
is
this:
assume
in
the
diana
levine
case
there
had
been
a
strict
liability
claim
that
went
all
the
way
through.
the
question
under
a
strict
liability
law
would
be
would
a
--
would
--
did
the
warning
lessen
the
risk
that
she
would
have
had
gangrene
and
amputation
of
her
arm?
the
adequacy
of
the
warning
under
a
strict
liability
law
simply
goes
to
did
the
manufacturer
adequately
describe
the
risks
that
the
patient
might
incur.
in
the
levine
case
it
very
well
might
have
been
that
the
warning
adequately
describes
that
there's
a
possibility
of
gangrene,
but
it
didn't
do
enough
to
lessen
the
risk
that
she
would
sustain.
and
because
there
was
a
way
to
change
the
label
to
lessen
that
risk,
she
got
a
judgment
for
a
failure
to
warn.
because
the
manufacturer's
conduct
was
such
that
it
could
have
improved
the
label.
here
we
acknowledge
and
the
evidence
shows
there
is
no
way
to
change
the
label
here.
some
--
some
--
some
number
of
people,
maybe
some
in
this
room,
might
take
sulindac
and
get
sjs/ten.
we
don't
know
who
they
are,
and
we
can't
write
words
that
would
tell
anyone
in
this
room,
you
have
a
lesser
chance
of
getting
that
horrible
disease.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
let's
be
clear,
justice
breyer.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
application
of
impossibility
preemption,
which
i
don't
think
anybody
here
can
argue
with
a
straight
face
that
simply
paying
a
judgment
in
strict
liability
is
impossible
in
light
of
the
federal
regime,
an
obstacle
preemption.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
there
could
be
cases
out
there
like
your
life-saving
type
drug,
which
by
the
way
has
a
special
regulation
under
a
special
statute
to
ensure
that
that
is
on
the
market,
and
some
other
drug
where
the
risk/benefit
equation
is
--
is
such.
but
surely
in
our
system
we
have
to
trust
district
judges
to
be
able
to
grant
or
deny
judgments
as
a
matter
of
law,
where
they
conclude
that
the
evidence
would
not
be
sufficient
to
show
that
the
risk
outweighed
the
benefit.
and
here,
the
judge
made
very
clear
that
because
mutual
had
not
put
in
any
evidence
of
the
benefit
of
its
drug
at
all
and
arguably
couldn't
have
done
so
because
this
drug
is
like
aspirin
--
except
that
it
causes
these
horrific
injuries
--
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
jury
which
can
decide
misbranding
actions
under
the
fdca,
and
that
has
been
acknowledged
by
the
majority
in
wyeth
v.
levine,
can
make
the
very
same
risk/benefit
safety
determination
that
justice
thomas
in
his
concurring
opinion
said
also
is
--
enabled
the
states
to
make.
the
states
are
not
precluded
under
the
fdca
from
making
that
kind
of
judgment.
so
in
the
hard
case,
justice
breyer,
there
is
a
mechanism
for
preemption.
the
fda
has
to
act.
it
has
to
act
pursuant
to
notice
and
comment
rulemaking.
it
has
to
identify
which
drugs
it
thinks
would
not
be
subject
to
these
kinds
of
strict
liability
claims.
but
it
hasn't
done
that
here.
all
it's
done
is
to
say,
we
happen
to
have
some
evidence
in
our
files,
ergo
preemption.
well,
preemption
doesn't
work
like
that
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is.
the
label
changed
after
karen
bartlett
sustained
the
injuries
that
she
did
in
this
case.
in
fact,
that
was
one
of
the
arguments
that
--
that
at
the
time,
this
was
before
pliva,
okay?
so
there
was
a
lot
of
failure
to
warn
being
argued,
because
the
regime,
as
the
case
came
into
trial
was
under
wyeth
v.
levine,
it
was
not
under
the
pliva
v.
mensing
case.
so
justice
kagan,
that's
why
it's
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
trial
lawyers
here
to
think
that
the
warning
is
an
appropriate
thing
because
this
court's
case
that
had
just
been
decided
made
that
perfectly
clear.
but
what
was
interesting
here
was
that
judge
laplante
made
a
very
clear
distinction
between
the
role
that
the
warning
would
play,
appropriately
so,
under
a
strict
liability
regime.
now,
i
would
like
to
note
that
the
avocado
case
is
one
that
did
not
entail
the
state
banning
avocado
sales.
judge
boudin
is
absolutely
right
when
he
says
that
there
is
nothing
under
the
fdca
to
preclude
the
state
from
making
a
reasonable
safety
determination
that
might
lead
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
drug.
now,
admittedly,
that
is
a
rare
circumstance.
and
that
is
not
what
new
hampshire
is
doing
here,
and
in
his
post-trial
orders
judge
laplante
made
clear
that
is
not
what
new
hampshire
is
imposing
here.
all
new
hampshire
is
imposing
here
is
a
duty
to
pay
compensation
if
your
unreasonably
dangerous
product
harms
a
patient.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
because
the
--
the
duty
here,
if
there
is
any
duty
to
stop
selling
under
new
hampshire
law,
it
can
be
complied
with
by
not
selling
the
drug.
there's
nothing
in
federal
law
that
requires
or
mandates
the
sale
of
these
drugs.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
would
be
very
dangerous.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
it
would
be
dangerous
to
try
comply
with
both
at
the
same
time.
but
certainly
if--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yeah.
if
the
difference
--
right.
but
the
difference,
justice
alito,
is
what
is
the
content
of
the
substantive
duty.
if
the
content
of
the
substantive
duty
is
you
--
the
state
says
to
do
one
thing
and
the
feds
say
do
the
opposite,
that's
impossibility
conflict.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
right.
but
our
position,
justice
scalia,
is
if
you
that
follow
pliva
to
what
it
says
in
its
logical
extension,
you
look
at
the
--
you
look
at
the
content
of
the
duty
there,
the
content
of
the
duty
was
to
change
the
label.
what
the
majority
opinion
says
is
that
minnesota
and
louisiana
law
said
you
must
change
the
label
and
the
federal
government
says,
you
cannot
change
the
label.
so
here--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--actually
we
dispute
what
they
say,
and
we've
got
an
--
an
excursus
about
mensing
in
our
brief,
and
what
is
clear
is
that
as
the
case
came
to
this
court,
the
only
duty
that
was
being
litigated
was
the
duty
concerning
the
warning
label.
there
was
not
a
strict
liability
claim
in
the
sense
of
a
design
defect.
mind
you,
there
are
strict
liability
claims
in
--
in
failure
to
warn
as
well.
that
is
essentially
what
comment
k
gets
at.
this
case
however,
was
tried
as
a
design
case
only,
and
the
state
law
duty
made
very
clear
there
was
no
duty
to
change
the
design
of
the
drug.
and
so
therefore,
under
mensing,
there
can't
be
impossibility
because
state
law
is
not
telling
you--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
breyer,
that's
not
an
impossibility
hypothetical.
that's
an
obstacle
hypothetical.
and
in
wyeth,
i
think
six
justices
said
there
is
no
obstacle
under
the
fdca
of
having
state
law
remedies
to
compensate
injured
patients.
so,
you
know,
the
reason
why
it's
important
to
keep
these
concepts
of
preemption
distinct
is
that
they
ask
you
to
grant
cert
on
whether
or
not
it
is
impossible
to
comply
in
light
of
pliva,
which
was
an
impossibility
preemption
case.
that
was
not
an
obstacle
preemption
case.
now,
having,
you
know,
i
think
gotten
a
deeper
view
of
what
state
law
requires,
they're
seeking
to
shift
the
case
into
an
obstacle
case,
and
virtually
all
of
the
federal
government's
arguments
here
are
obstacle-type
arguments.
it
is
because
the
fda
is
so
expert
that
it
has
this
information
in
its
files
and
that
that
should
therefore
negate
and
displace
and
nullify
state
law,
which
is
a
rather
sweeping
proposition.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
granted--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
yes.
our
position,
and
we
--
we
--
we
made
this
clear
that
all
they
were
asking
in
the
cert
petition
was
for
an
impossibility
look
at
pliva.
the
obstacle
argument
has
been
waived
in
our
view
of
the
way
this
court
ordinarily
takes
certiorari
cases
and
then
decides
them.
so
--
and
on
the
impossibility
point,
i
think
that
our
position
is
clear.
now,
justice
kagan,
the
very
first
question
out
of
the
box
was
does
this
rule
that
they're
advocating
apply
to
brand
name
drugs
and
the
answer
unfortunately
is
yes.
because
the
premise
of
their
argument
is
that
simply
because
the
fda
approved
the
drug
and
there
would
need
to
be
some
state
law
claim
that
would
give
rise
to
some
alteration,
that
that
necessarily
would
mean
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
comply
with.
and
so
that
applies
to
brand
name
drugs
as
well
as
generic
drugs.
we
don't
see
a
principal
difference,
unfortunately,
to
distinguish
them.
there
may
be
some
difference
in
certain
state
laws.
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
all
50
states,
but
the
basic
gist
of
their
argument
is
fda
approval
over
olives.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
the
fda
requires
a
--
a
new
drug
or
an
abbreviated
drug
application
--
i
get
the
terms
of
them
sometimes
confused
--
but
if
there
was
to
be
a
tweak
to
the
design,
they'd
need
to
go
to
the
fda
to
get
approval
for
that.
i
want
to
make
one
other
point,
which
is
that
strict
liability
applies
to
distributors
as
well
as
to
manufacturers.
and
so
here
it
seems
obvious
that
a
distributor
can't
change
the
design
and
it
cannot
change
the
label.
but
under
normal
principles
of
strict
liability,
the
idea
is
that
if
you
are
a
seller
of
the
product
in
your
normal
course
and
it
is
a
dangerous
product
that
causes
somebody
to
be
injured,
you
can
be
held
liable
in
strict
liability.
that
principle
is
very
well
settled.
and
so
it
would
seem
odd
to
suppose
that
the
distributor
who
has
no
power
to
make
any
change
in
conduct
that
would
make
the
product
any
safer
also
gets
to
be
immunized
from
suit.
i
have
no
further
points
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
i've
never
been
in
a
case
in
my
time
arguing
before
this
court
where
somebody
in
a
reply
brief
at
the
merits
put
in
evidence
that
they
did
not
put
in
at
trial
and
they
sought
to
persuade
you
that
that
was
somehow
relevant.
number
2,
the
issue
here
concerns
sulindac
manufactured
by
all
the
different
manufacturers
of
sulindac,
not
just
mutual.
number
3,
we
never
have
seen
that
information.
it
was
never
served
on
us.
we
have
no
way
to
test
it.
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
is
accurate
or
not.
number
4,
if
they
are
only
making
$7
million,
they
ought
to
withdraw
from
the
market,
because
their
--
their
product
causes
such
horrific
injuries
it
ought
not
to
be
sold.
thank
you.
