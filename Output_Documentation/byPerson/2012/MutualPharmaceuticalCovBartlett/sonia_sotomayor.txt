justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
tell
me,
is
--
is
it
now
your
position,
and
it
seems
to
be,
that
any
time
the
fda
approves
a
product
that
there
can
never
be
a
tort
liability
claim
because
the
fda's
approval
is
now
the
ceiling
of
what
you
can
do?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
approve
nonprescription
drugs.
they
approve
a
lot
of
things.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
not
true
with
respect
to
the
active
ingredients.
an
active
ingredient
requires
a
new
fda
approval
process.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
--
but
we
came
back
to
the
same
point,
which
is
--
and
we
are
sort
of
dancing
around
the
argument
--
which
is
what
happens
with
a
truly
dangerous
drug,
and
we
can
posit
one,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
warning
of
whether
it's
adequate
or
not,
but
a
drug
that
on
its
face
no
reasonable
practitioner
--
i'm
going
to
the
restatement
third
formulation
--
no
reasonable
practitioner,
knowing
all
the
benefits
and
risks,
would
ever
prescribe
this
drug.
because
your
adversary
basically
took
that
position
at
trial.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
doesn't
matter
--
there
were
other,
safer,
one-molecule
drugs;
no
one
should
have
prescribed
this,
no
matter
what
the
label.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
we
can
argue.
but
let's
go
to
the
point
i
raised,
which
is,
i
think
what
you
are
arguing
now
is
that
no
truly
bad
drug,
that
shouldn't
be
on
the
market,
would
there
ever
be
a
tort
claim
that
anybody
could
bring--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--because
the
fda
approved
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
tort
claim
could
they
bring?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
both,
again,
the
brand
could
manufacture
and
the
generic.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how?
the
fda
approved
the
design.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
they
couldn't
change
it
without
fda
approval.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
isn't
there
a
first
circuit--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
without
the
preemption
clause,
actually,
with
an
express
saving
clause,
you're
arguing
essentially
complete
field
preemption.
you're
basically
saying
the
minute
that
the
fda
gives
you
permission
to
sell,
it's
a
right
to
sell.
and
--
and
it
can't
be
altered
by
any
state
police
power.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
i
don't
see
how
you're
not
saying
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
that's
your
--
you're
telling
me
that's
exactly
what
the
fda
is
saying.
you're
saying
there
is
no
such
thing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
there's
no
strict
liability
that
a
state
could
impose.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
applies
to
everything
that
requires
fda
approval,
or
is
this
a
prescription
drug-only
rule?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
just
--
just
to
--
because
my
memory
is
failing
me,
is
this
drug
still
on
the
market?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
and
is
it
on
the
market
with
a
different
label?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
your
point
in
this
case
that
obstacle
preemption
has
been
waived?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
or
were
you
granted
cert
just
on
impossibility?
