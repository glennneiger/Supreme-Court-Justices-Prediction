chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
12-142,
mutual
pharmaceutical
company
v.
bartlett.
mr.
lefkowitz.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
one
of
our
cases--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yang?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
a
little
different.
our
cases
are
focused
on
the
concern
that
the
state
is
going
to
impose
on
the
manufacturer
a
different
duty
than
the
federal
government.
that's
not
what's
going
on
in
a
strict
liability
regime.
they're
saying,
we're
not
saying
you
should
have
a
different
structure,
we're
not
saying
anything
about
warning;
we're
saying
if
you
do
this,
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
for
the
damage.
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
different
duty.
and
i
think
that's
what's
underlying
the
argument
that,
well,
you
can
just
stop
selling,
because
you
don't
have
to
adjust
how
you're
going
to
make
the
drug.
you
understand
that
it's
going
to
be
the
same
as
the
federal
drug,
but
our
system
is,
you
pay
for
the
damage.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
is
that
meeting
a
standard
under
state
law
that
your
friend's
argument
says,
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about
here.
the
standard
is
the
same.
it's
just
a
question
under
strict
liability
that
if
you
follow
the
same
federal
standard
and
market
this
in
our
state,
you're
going
to
pay
the
compensation
for
the
reason
of,
you
know,
spreading
the
costs.
we
don't
want
you
to
do
something
different.
we
just
want
to
say
that
you
want
to
do
the
same
thing
as
the
federal
government,
and
then
you're
going
to
have
to
pay.
it's
different
than
the
--
at
least
that's
how
i
understand
their
argument,
which
is
that
it's
different
where
the
situation
says,
yes,
you
can
market
it
and
avoid
payment,
but
only
if
you
do
it
our
way.
that's
a
different
duty
for
the
manufacturer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
briefly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
frederick?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
so
sure
--
i'm
not
so
sure
it
works
that
way,
because
of
the
jury
point.
they
didn't
say
that
yes,
you
can
market
this
drug,
it
benefits,
you
know,
99.9
percent
of
the
people,
but
there
is
that
0.1
percent,
and
you're
going
to
have
to
compensate
that
person.
they
said
the
risks
outweigh
the
benefits,
period.
so
you
should
not
market
this
at
all.
and
it
does
seem
inconsistent
with
the
--
the
federal
regime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
in
that
case?
you've
got
one
jury
saying
the
risks
outweigh
the
benefits;
can't
do
it.
and
then
you're
saying
well,
later,
there
might
be
another
jury
saying
yes,
you
can.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
saying
you
didn't
put
the
warning
in,
so
you
are
liable
for
$9
million,
and
saying,
you
are
liable
for
$15
million,
but
if
you
put
the
warning
in,
you
are
only
liable
for
9
million?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
--
but
just
to
get
back
to
my
--
to
my
question.
you
say
there
is
a
difference
between
saying,
you
have
to
put
on
warning
and
you
are
going
to
be
liable
if
you
don't,
and
saying,
you
are
liable
no
matter
no
matter
what,
because
it's
strict
liability,
but
if
you
put
on
a
warning
it's
reduced.
if
you
are
a
drug
manufacturer,
you
are
supposed
to
see
a
difference
in
those
two
situations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
just
--
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
but
your
friend
on
the
other
side,
of
course,
says
pliva
involves
strict
liability
as
well.
so
it
did
not
say
you
must
change
the
label.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lefkowitz,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
alito
also
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-142,
mutual
pharmaceutical
company
versus
bartlett.
