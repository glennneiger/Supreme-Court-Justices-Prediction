suppose
that
new
hampshire
had
a
real
strict
liability
regime,
so
that
you
--
you
sell
a
drug,
and
whether
it's
unreasonably
dangerous
or
not
it
causes
an
injury,
you
pay,
to
spread
the
costs.
would
there
be
a
problem
with
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
mr.
frederick
argues
that
that
--
that's
the
thrust
of
the
--
of
the
new
hampshire
law.
why
is
he
wrong
on
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
just
ask
this
one
more
follow-up?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
--
why
would
--
why
is
a
generic
manufacturer
in
a
worse
position
under
the
absolute
liability
scheme
than
it
would
be
under
the
new
hampshire
scheme?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
because
under
the
absolute
scheme
they
might
say,
if
that's
the
cost,
we
are
not
going
to
sell
this
drug
at
all?
is
that
the
reason?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
that's
correct,
and
maybe
it
is,
doesn't
that
mean
the
drug
should
never
have
been
approved?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
isn't
it
true
that
when
the
--
the
fda
reviewed
this
whole
class
of
drugs,
they
decided
to
pull
bextra
but
not
this
drug?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
--
the
sg
says
that
the
fda
did
have
this
right,
did
have
it
and
did
consider
it,
and
that's
incorrect?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
argument
about
stopping
the
sale
of
the
drug
completely
seems
to
me
to
eliminate
the
impossibility
--
impossibility
preemption,
doesn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
that's
true
--
isn't
that
true
often
in
--
in
these
impossibility
cases?
let
me
say
congress
passes
a
law
that
says
everywhere
in
the
united
states
you
must
drive
on
the
right
side
of
the
road,
and
new
hampshire
is
quirky,
they
say,
in
new
hampshire
you
have
to
drive
on
the
left
side
of
the
road.
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
clear
impossibility
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
you
could
comply
with
both
rules
by
not
driving.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
not
to
drive
at
all?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
decide
--
if
you
decide
to
drive--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
this
case,
we
must
determine
whether
new
hampshire's
design-defect
tort
law
cause
of
action
was
preempted
by
federal
law.
responding
karen
bartlett
was
prescribed
clinoril,
the
brand
name
version
of
the
pain
reliever
sulindac
for
shoulder
pain.
her
pharmacist
dispensed
a
generic
form
of
sulindac
manufactured
by
petitioner
mutual
pharmaceutical.
the
results
were
disastrous.
respondent
experienced
a
rare
hypersensitivity
reaction
to
sulindac
and
suffered
severe
and
permanent
injuries.
she
sued
mutual
pharmaceutical
and
a
federal
jury
ultimately
retuned
a
large
verdict
against
mutual
pharmaceutical
based
on
a
new
hampshire
design-defect
tort
law
cause
of
action.
the
first
circuit
affirmed.
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
provides
that
the
laws
and
treaties
of
the
united
states
are
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
we
have
long
held
that
state
laws
that
conflict
with
federal
law
are
preempted.
that
is
without
a
fact.
one
way
that
state
laws
can
conflict
with
federal
law
is
by
requiring
a
private
party
to
take
an
action
that
federal
law
prohibits.
in
such
cases,
there
is
what
has
been
termed
impossibility
pre-emption.
here,
state
law
imposes
just
such
a
duty.
new
hampshire's
design-defect
cause
of
action
requires
a
manufacturer
to
ensure
that
its
products
are
not
unreasonably
dangerous
to
consumers.
it
may
fulfill
that
duty
in
any
or
all
of
three
ways
by
increasing
the
products'
usefulness,
by
decreasing
its
risk
of
danger,
or
by
strengthening
the
products'
warnings.
here,
the
first
two
avenues
were
close
to
mutual
by
both
federal
law
and
basic
chemistry.
changing
sulindac's
usefulness
or
risk
of
danger
would
have
required
mutual
to
change
sulindac's
chemical
composition,
but
federal
law
prohibits
manufacturers
from
making
such
changes.
the
federal
food
and
drug
act
fast
tracks
generic
drugs
to
market
on
the
assurance
that
their
chemical
composition
is
identical
to
that
of
their
brand-name
counterparts
and
federal
law
prohibits
manufacturers
from
deviating
from
that
approved
design.
moreover,
because
sulindac
is
a
one-molecule
drug
redesign,
it
was
chemically
impossible.
thus,
new
hampshire
law
ultimately
required
mutual
to
strengthen
its
label.
unsurprisingly,
allegations
that
sulindac's
labeling
was
inadequate
featured
prominently
at
trial.
but
as
we
recognized
two
terms
ago
in
pliva,
inc.
versus
mensing,
federal
law
prohibits
generic
drug
manufacturers
from
changing
the
labels
that
the
fda
has
approved
for
their
drugs.
accordingly,
because
it
required
mutual
to
take
actions
that
federal
law
prohibited
new
hampshire's
warning-based
design-defect
cause
of
action
is
pre-empted.
the
first
circuit
solution
that
mutual
could
have
complied
with
both
state
and
federal
law
by
simply
pulling
sulindac
from
the
market
is
no
real
solution.
our
impossibility
pre-emption
cases
have
presumed
that
an
actor
seeking
to
satisfy
conflicting
state
and
federal
law
obligations
is
not
required
to
cease
acting
altogether
in
order
to
avoid
liability,
at
least
where
neither
state
law
nor
federal
law
imposes
such
an
obligation.
indeed,
if
the
option
of
ceasing
to
act
defeated
a
claim
of
impossibility,
impossibility
pre-emption
would
be
all
but
meaningless
in
every
case
including
pliva
in
which
we
have
found
impossibility
pre-emption
would
have
been
wrongly
decided.
this
case
arises
out
of
tragic
circumstances
and
we
reach
our
conclusion
only
reluctantly,
but
the
application
of
long
standing
pre-emption
principles
compels
our
result.
the
judgment
of
the
first
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
kagan
has
joined.
justice
sotomayor
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined.
