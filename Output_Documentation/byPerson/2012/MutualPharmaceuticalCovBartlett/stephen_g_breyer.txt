justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
that.
but
i
don't
understand
why
that
matters.
that
is,
the
--
i
mean,
i
was
thinking
just
what
you
said.
i
was
thinking
well,
i
--
i
dissented
in
the
other
case,
but
i
lost,
okay?
so
i
lost,
i
lost.
the
--
the
--
the
point
is
that
--
that
you
have
a
drug,
and
you
say
to
the
jury,
well,
if
there
were
no
warning
here
at
all,
then
it
would
be
unreasonably
dangerous.
i
think,
yes,
that
probably
applies
to
chemotherapy,
it
probably
applies
to
parkinson's,
it
probably
applies
to
all
kind
--
but
you
see,
says
the
defense,
there
is
a
warning
here
and
it
says
how
to
use
it.
and
as
you
say,
that
would
be
not
--
it
would
be
despite
or
whatever
it
is,
despite,
not
because.
but
it
seems
to
me
in
terms
of
--
it
comes
for
the
same
thing,
lots
of
drugs
would
be
dangerous,
too
dangerous,
unreasonably
so
without
a
warning.
chemotherapy
is
what
i'm
thinking
of.
but
properly
labeled
they're
not,
and
so
that
seems
to
be
your
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
--
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
they
have
to
find
that
--
that
no
warning
--
there
is
no
such
warning
that
could
make
a
difference,
that's
what
they're
asked
to
find?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
is
that?
that's
--
i
do
see
that
distinction.
if,
what
you're
--
but
look,
the
complaint's
filled
with
words
about
adequate
warning,
no
adequate
warning,
no
adequate
warning,
da,
da,
da.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now
what
you're
saying
is,
is
really
what
the
jury
found,
nothing
to
do
with
adequate.
there
is
no
warning
in
the
world
that
anybody
could
have
invented
that
would
have
made
a
difference.
i'll
have
to
think
about
that
one.
but
in
the
meantime,
where
is
it
that
that's
what
they
said?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
how
do
i
discover
that
you're
right
about
this?
because
everything
in
the
--
in
the
complaint
that
i've
read
so
far
seems
to
talk
about
the
adequacy
of
warnings,
not
that
there
is
no
warning
in
the
universe
could
possibly
have
made
a
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
i
discover
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
second
point
is
a
different
point.
the
second
point
is,
look,
i
have
chemotherapy,
it
saves
100
and
it
kills
10.
all
right.
if
you
have
no
label
at
all,
a
jury
might
find
it
was
unreasonably
dangerous,
but
once
you
put
in
the
label
explaining
the
whole
thing,
it
doesn't.
it
isn't
unreasonably
dangerous
because
of
the
situation,
and
they
could
perhaps
wouldn't
find
it.
now,
you
can
call
that
diminishing
or
you
could
call
it
adequacy.
call
it
what
you
want,
but
that
seems
to
me
to
come
to
the
same
thing
and
is
different
from
saying,
no
label
in
the
universe
would
say
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
talking
about
what
juries
could
find
and
that's
what
--
and
i
don't
know
about
parkinson's
--
i
don't
know
what
these
drugs
are.
that's
why
i
said
let
the
fda
say
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
then
if
you
apply
this
--
what
is
deeply
bothering
me
in
all
these
cases,
and
it's
why
i
came
up
with
and
said,
the
fda
has
to
tell
us,
you
know.
because
just
what
you
said
before;
what
you
say
applies
to
sulindac
also
applies
to
12
people
who
will
tell
the
mary
hitchcock
hospital
up
in
dartmouth
that
they
can't
use
a
certain
kind
of
chemotherapy.
you
see,
you
could
in
certain
horrible
cases
find
a
very
sympathetic
plaintiff
who
really
did
suffer
terribly.
and
--
and
--
and
you
are
getting
12
people
rather
than
the
fda.
so
my
solution
to
it,
which
you
know,
because
you
read
medtronics,
may
not
work;
but
it's
the
best
i
can
think
of.
now,
what
--
what
--
you
can
tell
me
if
you
want,
no,
there
is
some
totally
different
thing.
but
what
you
are
saying
at
the
moment,
what
i
do
in
my
mind
is
i
say,
beware;
because
it's
also
true
potentially
of
some
of
these
life-saving
drugs
and
that's
what's
worrying
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
even
the
compensation,
suppose
you
had
strict
liability
that
florida
avocado
growers
could
--
what
they
have
to
do,
all
they
have
to
do
since
they
can
just
be
fined
and
the
money
would
go
to
pay
the
consumers
of
california
who
have
the
unfortunate
mixup
sometimes
of
eating
florida
avocados.
i
mean,
that
would
raise
at
least
serious
problems
of
--
commerce
clause
problems
and
preemption
and
so
forth.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
on
page
5496,
adequacy
of
the
warning,
i
guess,
the
judge
says,
is
not
an
issue
before
this
jury.
and
that
was
the
point.
