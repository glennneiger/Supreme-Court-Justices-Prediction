mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
classic
case
of
impossibility
preemption.
federal
law
required
generic
sulindac
to
have
the
same
ingredients,
the
same
warning
and
the
same
safety
profile
as
the
branded
version,
but
a
new
hampshire
jury
imposed
liability
because
sulindac
didn't
have
a
different
safety
profile,
meaning
a
different
ingredient
or
a
different
warning.
and
as
mensing
recognized,
that's
an
impossibility
conflict.
and
there
is
no
principle
basis
for
treating
design
defect
claims
any
differently
from
failure
to
warn
claims.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
justice
kagan,
it's
--
it's
certainly
the
position
that
the
government
takes
in
its
brief.
i'm
sure
plaintiff's
lawyers
would
find
arguments
to
differ.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
it's
really
a
distinction
without
a
difference
in
real
life,
because
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
wyeth
case,
what
happens
across
the
board
is
that
design
defect
claims
are
brought
either
as
they
are
in
nearly
every
state
where
there
is
a
warning
component,
or--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--if
you
are
hypothecating
--
hypothesizing
a
pure
design
defect
regime,
we're
not--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--correct.
that
is
certainly
the
argument
the
government
makes.
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
the
court
would
find
any
type
of
distinction
as
the
court
did
in
wyeth,
but
that
is
certainly
an
appropriate
interpretation
of
what
the
government
is
saying--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--your
honor--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--as
a
legal
matter,
i'm
not
sure
reading
the
fdca
there
is
a
matter.
my
point
is
simply
that
in
the
real
world,
the
cases
are
going
to
be
brought
as
failure
to
warn
claims,
or
as
design
defect
claims
with
warnings
component.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a
way
to
distinguish.
if
you
were
dealing
in
a
regime
in
a
state
statute
or
a
state
tort
regime
where
the
only
issue
was
design,
unlike
in
the
new
hampshire
design
defect,
where
as
we
know
from
pa
18
where
the
first
circuit
made
clear
that
it
in
fact
was
the
lack
of
an
adequate
warning
that
in
fact
made
the
drug
more
dangerous
under
the
design
defect
case,
the
supreme
court's
case
vautour,
which
is
the
leading
new
hampshire
case.
and
in
fact
the
jury
instruction
in
this
case
was
a
binary
choice.
it
specifically
said,
if
you
find
that
the
drug
is
unreasonably
dangerous,
then
you
have
to
take
a
look
at
was
the
warning
sufficient
or
not.
we
have
a
case
here
that
is
directly
controlled
by
mensing,
because
the
warning
was
critical
to
the
design
defect
case.
we
also
have
a
case
here
that
even
if
it
were
just
purely
a
design
defect
case,
at
least
with
respect
to
a
generic
drug
company,
the
federal
sameness
mandate,
the
same
federal
sameness
mandate
that
applied
in
mensing
to
warnings,
applies
in
design
defect
cases.
and
therefore
it
is
a
classic
impossibility
case,
just
as
the
court
found
in
mensing.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
absolutely
not,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
absolutely.
and
justice
sotomayor,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
mensing
--
in
wyeth
--
and
as
justice
thomas
made
clear
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
just
because
a
drug
is
granted
an
approval
by
the
fda
does
not
mean
that
it's
entitled
to
have
the
same
label
for
all
time.
the
distinction,
though,
that
the
court
articulated
was
that
in
wyeth
a
brand
company
has
the
authority,
and
indeed
as
this
court
found,
the
obligation
to
update
its
warnings.
a
generic--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--but
--
but
we
were
talking
in
that
case
about
the
warning.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--actually,
justice
sotomayor,
that
is
not
the
position
my
adversary
took
at
trial.
my
adversary
specifically
put
on
a
case
about
the
warnings
and
said,
the
fact
that
sjs/ten
was
warned
about
in
the
adverse
reaction
section
and
cross-referenced
within
the
warning
section
was
not
sufficient.
if
it
had
been
in
the
warning
section
like
the
fda
later
said
it
should
be,
that
would
have
made
the
difference.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
absolutely
not--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--absolutely
not.
that's
not
our
argument
at
all.
our
argument,
first
of
all,
is
a
very
narrow
argument--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--well,
they
could
bring--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--right
now
if
the
plaintiff
--
the
respondent
here
had
taken
the
brand-name
drug
clinoril
instead
of
the
generic
sulindac,
in
the
new
hampshire
law,
as
it
exists
and
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit,
she
would
have
had
both
a
design
defect
claim
and
a
failure
to
warn
claim.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
because
the
design
defect
claim--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--but
they
could
change
the
warning,
and
that's
the
essential
component,
as
the
first
circuit
made
clear.
at
pa
18
what
the
first
circuit
said
was
the
label
was
relevant
to
the
design
defect
claim.
the
lack
of
a
clearer
warning
made
the
product
itself
more
dangerous
under
the
risk/benefit
tests
prescribed
by
bextra.
that's
the
design
defect
standard.
so
had
the
respondent
taken
the
brand-name
drug,
she
would
have
had
a
cause
of
action,
even
under
the
articulation
of
the
sameness
standard
under
hatch-waxman
that
we
are
articulating
here.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that's
exactly
the
same
issue
that
we
had
in
the
mensing
case
a
couple
years
ago.
obviously
we
understand
that
not
all
consumers
get
to
select
on
their
own;
their
doctors
select
or
maybe
their
state
medicaid
laws
make
this
choice,
or
the
pharmacy;
but
the
standards
--
again,
conflict
preemption
comes
when
the
state
is
imposing
a
requirement
or
an
obligation
or
enforcing
a
standard
that
you
simply
can't
comply
with
under
federal
law
without
violating
federal
law.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
justice
alito,
i
think
if
we
had
what
would
really
be
an
absolute
liability
scheme,
i
think
is
really
what
you
are
suggesting,
something
similar
to
the
kind
of
vaccine
compensation
program
that
we
heard
about
this
morning,
that
would
not
raise
impossibility
preemption
problems
at
all.
it
might
or
might
not
raise
obstacle
issues;
it
would
depend
perhaps
on
the
scope
of
the
program,
whether
it
was
singling
out
certain
types
of
drugs,
how
expensive
it
was;
but
that
would
be
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well,
he's
wrong
because
--
price
v.
dick
--
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
case,
says
very
clearly:
"we
do
not
have
an
absolute
liability
system.
"
"we
do
not
make
manufacturers
insurers
of
their
product.
"
and
in
fact,
mr.
frederick
on
page
21
of
his
brief
articulates
the
standards
for
liability
in
this
very
case
where
he
said,
it
has
to
be
found
unreasonably
dangerous.
and
we
know
from
judge
boudin's
statement
that
i
just
read
that
that
--
that
condition
of
unreasonable
dangerousness
is
premised
in
large
part
on
the
question
of
the
warning;
and
it
makes
sense,
because
drugs
are
unavoidably
dangerous.
if
you
have--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--sure.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--no,
it's
--
it's
not
a
question
of
--
of
policy
choices,
it's
a
question
of
operation
of
law.
the
issue
here
--
states
are
free
to
do
lots
of
different
things;
they
only
are
not
free
to
do
things
when
they
conflict
directly
with
federal
obligations.
basically
the
supremacy
clause
sets
up
a
rule
of
priority.
and
you
have
that
rule
of
priority
come
into
play
when
you
have
a
state
requirement
and
you
have
a
federal
requirement.
here
the
vaccine
program
does
not
hinge
on
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
generic
company
violated
a
safety
standard,
whether
the
state
is
saying,
your
drug
is
too
dangerous
either
because
of
the
warning
or
because
of
the
design.
it
is
simply
saying,
we
are
going
to
charge
manufacturers
$1
dollar
per
prescription
or--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--with
respect
to
the
question,
justice
ginsburg,
as
the
mensing
court
made
clear,
when
this
very
issue
came
up
with
respect
to
warnings
which
are
commanded
as
a
sameness
requirement
by
federal
law
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
molecule,
the
design,
the
federal
regime
does
operate
as
a
floor
and
as
a
ceiling.
and
when
federal
law
authorizes
you
to
market
a
drug
in
interstate
commerce
by
granting
you
the
anda,
that
comes
with
it
enormous
protections.
in
fact,
congress
has
established--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--there
is
no
express
preemption
clause
here.
however,
as
we
know
from
mensing
where
the
court
articulated
it
in
footnote
5
and
as
we
know
from
geier
where
the
court
went
and
said
ordinary
conflict
principles
apply.
in
fact,
even
when
we
have
an
express
preemption
clause
and
we
have
a
savings
clause,
that
they
don't
apply,
we
have
to
use
ordinary
operations
of
conflict--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--your
honor,
justice
kagan,
i'd
like
to
give
you
two
answers
to
that.
the
first
as
to
the
impossibility,
for
over
50
--
50
years
exactly
now,
this
court
has
been
articulating
as
the
paradigmatic
example
of
impossibility
preemption.
the
example
from
florida
lime
and
avocado
growers
where
the
federal
government
said
you
can't
sell
an
avocado
with
less
than
7
percent
and
you
can't
sell
--
and
the
state
said
you
can't
sell
the
avocado
with
more
than
8
percent
oil.
now,
clearly,
there
is
no
federal
obligation
to
sell
avocados.
i
would
submit
that
congress
is
not
agnostic
about
the
sale
drugs,
but
the
key
is
that
the
quintessential
example
of
impossibility
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
federal
right
at
all.
it
is
simply
conflicting
standards.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
justice
kagan,
the
very
same
issue
came
out
in
mensing
as
well.
after
all,
pliva
was
not
obligated
in
any
way
to
sell
metoclopramide
in
mensing.
but,
of
course,
this
court
found
that
that
was
a
case
of
impossibility
conflict.
and
moreover,
congress
has
--
as
i
said,
is
not
agnostic
here.
congress
had
established
a
regime
where
in
order
to
take
a
drug
off
the
market,
congress
had
said
the
fda
has
to
provide
the
company
with
all
sorts
of
due
process
protection,
direct
appeal
to
the
federal
court,
and
in
fact,
congress,
in
1997,
specified
that
any
people
at
the
fda
involved
in
the
drug
approval
process
at
all,
withdrawing
drugs
or
approving
drugs,
has
to
have
special
technical,
scientific
expertise,
very
different
from
what
we
have
in
lay
jurors.
but
simply
stated,
your
honor,
from
a
impossibility
perspective,
this
is
not
only
the
florida
lime
example,
this
is
the
mensing
case
as
well.
now,
you
know,
the
--
the
respondent
doesn't
really
take
issue
with
either
the
sameness
requirement
of
design
or
the
sameness
requirement
of
warning.
the
respondent
recognizes
that
our
hands
are
tied.
the
respondent
also
doesn't
really
try
to
do
much
with
salvaging
the
first
circuit's
dodge
on
supremacy
by
saying
we
could
stay
out
of
the
market.
instead,
what
the
respondent
does
is
he
tries
to
carve
out
a
distinction
between
strict
liability
and
negligence
claims.
and
all
i
will
say
before
reserving
my
time
is
there's
simply
no
basis
in
the
law.
this
court
made
clear
in
riegel
and
in
cipollone
and
in
several
other
cases
that
with
respect
to
preemption,
the
same
rules
apply,
strict
liability
or
negligence
imposed
requirements
by
this
case.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
just
make
three
brief
points.
it
is
rather
incredible
to
hear
counsel
talk
about
how
the
warnings
were
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
from
the
opening
statement
of
plaintiff's
counsel,
i'm
quoting
now,
"the
evidence
will
show
you
that
sulindac
was
unreasonably
dangerous
and
had
an
inadequate
warning
as
well.
"
"one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
show
you
this
will
be
to
show
you
that
they
got
a
new
and
better
warning
about
six
months
after
respondent
took
the
drug.
"
"the
label
got
better.
"
"and
at
ca
app.
2761,
we
have
the
fda
letter
explaining
exactly
why,
in
the
fda's
view,
the
new
warning
was
going
to
make
the
drug
safer.
"
"what
it
said--
"
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--absolutely
not.
it
was
a
proper
instruction
under
new
hampshire
law.
it
was
an
instruction
that--
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
--the
jury
applied
the
instruction
that
the
court
gave
it,
which
was
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
jury
was
good
enough
--
the
warning
was
good
enough
or
not.
and,
in
fact,
as
the
first
circuit
made
very,
very
clear
at
pa
18a,
it
said,
the
label
was
relevant
to
the
design
defect.
the
lack
of
a
clearer
warning
made
the
product
itself
more
dangerous
under
the
risk/benefit
analysis
of
new
hampshire
law.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
your
honor,
let
me
be
clear.
we
objected
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
case,
we
said
this
is
all
preempted.
there
is
no
ability
to
change
the
warnings.
the
warnings
are
acceptable
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
and
this
court,
every
justice
on
the
court
agreed
in
mensing
that
we
couldn't
change
the
warning.
once
the
court
rejected
that,
it
was
a
fair
statement
of
new
hampshire
law.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
the
trial
judge
rejected
our
summary
judgment
motion
on
preemption.
we
raised
these
issues.
mr.
jay
p.
lefkowitz
well,
he
said
that,
but
then
he
went
and
he
instructed
the
jury
and,
again,
as
the
first
circuit
made
clear,
it
was
in
fact
--
the
dangerousness
was
because
of
the
arguable
inadequacies
of
the
warning,
which
the
plaintiff
said
we
could
have
changed,
we
should
have
changed.
i
want
to
just
finish
with
two
brief
points,
if
i
may.
on
impossibility,
look,
this
impossibility
doctrine
under
preemption
is
premised
on
the
fact
that
parties
will
engage
in
conduct.
as
justice
breyer
made
clear
in
his
opinion
in
the
geier
case,
he
said,
under
ordinary
obstacle
principles,
a
state
might
be
able
to
make
you
liable
for
using
the
federally
required
windshield
retention
requirements.
obviously,
there
is
no
federal
requirement
to
sell
cars.
it
conditions
that
if
you
sell
the
car,
you
have
a
requirement.
if
you
sell
a
drug,
a
generic
drug,
you
have
a
particular
requirement.
the
distinction
between
strict
liability
and
negligence,
cipollone,
riegel,
make
absolutely
clear
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
for
a
distinction
under
law.
