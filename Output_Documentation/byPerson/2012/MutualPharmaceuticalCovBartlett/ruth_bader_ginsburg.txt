and
she
didn't
take
--
she
didn't
take
the
--
the
brand-name
drug
because
the
pharmacist
gave
her
the
generic,
but
she
didn't
know
brand,
generic;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
ruth

mr.
--
mr.
lefkowitz,
then
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
fda's
approval
is
not
only
what
everyone
agrees
it
is,
a
floor
to
enable
you
to
market,
but
it
is
also
a
ceiling;
that
is
you
meet
the
fda
objective
--
fda
approval
and
that
gives
you
a
right
to
market,
not
simply
an
access
to
the
market,
but
it
--
it
operates
as
a
ceiling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
something
in
the
--
in
the
act
that
says
that
the
states
have
no
role
with
respect
to
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
the
drug
--
the
drug;
it's
only
the
fda
approval,
that's
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
failure
--
the
failure
to
warn
defense
was
--
the
--
the
judge
struck
that
out.
so
there
was
no
failure
to
warn
defense
in
the
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
respond
to
the
argument,
mutual's
argument
that
they
have
--
in
2005,
they
made
--
this
drug
produced
$7
million.
the
jury
verdict
was
21
million.
they
said
that
3
years
of
their
earnings
wiped
out.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
get
to
the
jury's
--
to
the
instructions
to
the
jury?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
what
the
jury
was
supposed
to
apply,
not
what
counsel
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
said
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
jury
instructions,
at
least
you
didn't
object.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
--
how
did
the
court
reject
it?
they
threw
out
the
failure
to
warn
claim.
