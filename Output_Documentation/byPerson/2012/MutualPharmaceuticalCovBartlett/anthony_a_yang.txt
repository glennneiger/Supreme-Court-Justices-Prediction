mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
new
hampshire
law
applies
a
hybrid
design-defect
standard
that
imposes
liability
for
harm
caused
by
a
product
if
the
product,
in
light
of
the
manufacturer's
warnings,
is
unreasonably
dangerous.
now,
that
standard
falls
within
the
traditional
way
that
this
court
has
looked
at
impossibility
preemption
in
mensing.
it's
also
implicit
in
levine,
because
the
analysis
of
the
courts
--
the
analysis
in
levine
reflects
an
implicit
judgment
that
the
manufacturer
could
simply
stop
selling
the
product.
you
know,
if
that
were
enough
to
avoid
a
federal
impossibility
preemption,
there'd
be
no
reason
to
do
the--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--there
are
two,
i
think,
arguments
embedded
within
that.
there
is
a
question
of
whether
state
tort
law,
whether
by
negligence
or
strict
liability,
imposes
a
duty
that
might
conflict
with
the
federal
obligation.
and
the
second
argument,
i
think,
which
is
distinct,
is
that
if
you
could
simply
stop
selling,
that
would
be
a
way
of
--
of
cancelling
impossibility
preemption
if
there
were
in
fact
a
conflict
between
the
two
standards.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
the
duty
is
that
one
cannot
market
an
unreasonably
dangerous
drug
in
light
of
the
warnings
--
that's
unreasonably
dangerous
in
light
of
the
warnings.
and
what
that
means
is
that
a
manufacturer
will
have
to
pay
money
in
the
liability
suit
if
he
doesn't
meet
that
standard.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
riegel
and
in
earlier
--
in
cipollone,
that
this
type
of
tort
obligation,
when
you
contingent
--
make
an
obligation
to
pay
tort
liability
based
on
meeting
a
standard
under
state
law,
that
is
a
duty
that
could
conflict
with
a
federal
duty.
and
the
federal
duty--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
stop
selling,
which
i
think
is
what
your
question
goes
to,
that
you
can
always
escape
liability
if
you
simply
stop
selling
and
don't
have
the
market.
it's
not
clear
to
me,
first,
that
respondent
is
in
fact
adopting
the
government's
position,
because
in
our
view,
the
obligation
to
change
the
labeling
to
make
it
safer
and
therefore
escape
liability
under
design-defect
law
in
new
hampshire
falls
within
the
court's
decision
in
pliva
v.
mensing.
the
only
distinguishing
factor
we
think
that
is
material
here
would
be
whether
the
ability
to
stop
selling
mean
that
there's
really
not
a
conflicting
obligation.
and
as
that
would
have
been
true
in
mensing,
it
would
have
been
true
also
in
levine,
and
would
not
have
necessitated
any
impossibility
analysis.
and
i
think
this,
as
my
brother
was
just
explaining,
traces
back
to
florida
lime
and
avocado
growers.
the
court
framed
the
impossibility
preemption
inquiry
there
--
and
i
think
this
is
important
--
at
the
top
of
page
143.
it
says,
the
question
is
whether
compliance
with
federal
and
state
regulation
is
a
physical
impossibility
for
one
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
that
was
the
--
the
formulation.
so
the
idea
is
if
you
are
an
avocado
grower
in
florida
and
the
federal
government
said
you
have
to
pick
your
avocados
before
they're
at
7
percent
oil
and
then
california
says,
you
can't
sell
in
our
state
unless
it's
8
percent
oil,
it's
impossible
to
be
a
person
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
there
unless
you
violate
one
of
those
obligations.
and
when
you
have
to
violate
one
of
those
obligations,
it's
the
state
law
that
--
that
falls.
and
i
think,
justice
kagan,
you
were
explaining--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--let
me
draw
a
distinction
if
--
that
i
think
might
help.
when
the
federal
government
were
to
say
--
let's
go
--
stay
with
avocados
--
that
avocados
must
have
at
least
7
percent
oil.
and
the
state
says,
you
know
what,
we
think
it
actually
means
8
percent
oil.
it's
not
impossible
to
comply
there.
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme,
where
an
expert
agency
with
the
relevant
information
makes
an
expert
judgment
based
on
sound
scientific
evidence
that
this
drug
is,
in
fact,
safe
and
effective
and--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--our
--
our
position
is--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--a
little
narrower.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
don't
think
the
court
has
addressed
this
question
expressly.
that
is
--
that's
true.
but
i
think
our
position
is
a
little
--
little
tighter
than
that.
which
is,
when
the
state
is
imposing
an
obligation,
they
do
it
based
on
a
safety
standard
--
that
is
in
fact
second-guessing
the
fda
--
that
is
preemptive.
not
simply
because
the
fda
has
set
the
standard,
but
the
fdca
also
has
within
it
the
judgment
that
safety
is
best
effectuated
not
only
by
having
the
fda
set
the
standard,
but
by
forbidding
any
manufacturer
from
deviating
from
that
once
it's
been
approved
by
the
fda.
when
we're
talking
about
a
drug's
formulation,
the
manufacturer
cannot
change
it.
and
that's
what
brings
this
within
the
ambit
of
pliva
v.
mensing.
and
it
also,
i
think,
reflects
why
the
florida
lime
example
is
--
is
relevant,
because
when--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
we're
--
we're
actually
not
saying
that.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
no,
with
respect
to
the
design-defect
claims
that
--
and
failure
to
warn,
with
respect
to
generics
--
remember,
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
mensing
--
we're
saying
the
result
in
mensing
controls
here.
now,
if
we
go
to
the
pure
design-defect
claim
--
and
a
pure
claim,
in
our
view,
is
one
in
which
carves
out
the
failure
to
warn
issue,
and
it
hypothesizes
a
reasonable
physician
that
knows
all
the
--
the
health
benefits
and
risks--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
but
we
--
in
that--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--if
i
might
just
finish.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
yes.
when
that
pure
design-defect
standard
has
been
satisfied,
it
means
that
no
physician
would
prescribe
the
drug
for
any
person,
which
means
that
drug,
regardless
of
how
you
might
improve
the
warnings
--
it
just
doesn't
matter,
because
they
know
all
--
all
the
adverse
and
positive
benefits
of
the
drug.
it
should
not
be
marketed
because
it
should
never
be
prescribed.
and
when
it
should
not
be
marketed
and
it
complies
with
the
federal
government's
misbranding
standard,
about
dangerous
to
health
when
used
as
instructed,
and
it
honors
the
fda's
rule
by
requiring
new
and
scientifically
significant
information
that
was
not
previously
before
the
fda,
that
would
not
be
preemptive.
that
is
not
this
case.
and
so
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
preserve
the
fda's
role
here,
not
have
juries
second-guess
on
a
case-by-case
and
state-by-state
basis
imposing
different
safety
obligations
on
manufacturers
--
when
congress
has
established
a
regime
for
fda
to
control
this.
now,
we're
not
saying
the
fda's
decision
is
forever
binding.
if
there
is
new
and
scientifically
significant
evidence
that
hasn't
been
considered
by
the
fda
--
and
this
is
analogous
to
what
the
court
already
did
in
wyeth
v.
levine
--
because
there,
in
the
impossibility
preemption,
the
court
looked
to
whether
or
not
there
would
be
newly
acquired
information
that
would
allow
a
manufacturer
to
go
within
the
changes
being
effected
regulation
in
order
to
change
the
labeling.
so
what
we're
doing
is
just
like
what
the
court
required
to
be
done
in
wyeth,
that
in
that
context,
if
you
meet
the
federal
misbranding
standard,
and
you
avoid
the
problem
of
pliva
--
because
you
don't
have--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--may
i
answer?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
with
respect
to
failure
to
warn,
you
can
--
prescription
drugs
can
be
sued,
generics
cannot.
with
respect
to
pure
design-defect
claims,
our
view
applies
to
both.
