justice
elena
kagan
mr.
lefkowitz,
could
i
understand
something
just
about
the
scope
of
your
argument?
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
we
are
not
really
dealing
with
generics;
we
are
also
dealing
with
brand-named
drugs.
and
i
guess
the
--
the
thought
there
would
be,
in
--
with
--
with
--
in
this
respect,
as
to
design,
as
compared
to
warnings,
but
as
to
design,
they're
really
all
in
the
same
boat.
in
other
words,
you
know,
they
have
a
design;
that
it
is
only
that
design
that's
approved.
if
they
change
their
design
there's
no
authority
to
continue
marketing
it.
they
have
to
go
back
to
square
one.
and
that's
just
as
true
of
brand
names
as
it
is
of
generics.
so
am
i
right
about
that?
that
--
that
if
we're
just
looking
at
a
pure
design
defect
claim,
putting
the
warning
card
aside,
where
you
are
in
a
different
position
from
the
brand-name
drugs,
but
as
to
design,
don't
the
brand-name
and
the
generics
go
hand
in
hand?
justice
elena
kagan
i
want
you
to
put
that
aside
for
me
for
just
a
second,
and
i
understand
that's
a
very
significant
thing
in
your
argument
to
put
aside.
but
let's
just
assume
that
there
was
a
design
defect
claim
that
didn't
have
to
do
with
warnings,
where
you
are
in
a
different
position.
let's
just
assume
on
a
pure
design
defect
claim,
am
i
right
that
generics
and
brand-name
manufacturers
are
in
the
same
position
with
respect
to
those
claims?
justice
elena
kagan
just
about
how
you
make
the
drug?
justice
elena
kagan
not
what
the
government,
i
mean,
i
myself,
i
just
can't
figure
out
what
distinction
there
would
be.
justice
elena
kagan
so
i'm
asking
you.
justice
elena
kagan
but,
you
--
but
again,
and
i
know
that
this
is
a
big
part
of
your
argument,
but
to
the
extent
that
a
warning
was
not
involved
in
the
claim,
and
it
was
just
about
the
design
of
a
drug,
i
guess
i'm
asking
you,
is
there
any
possible
way
to
distinguish
between
generics
and
brand-name
manufacturers?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
lefkowitz,
i
think
in
describing
the
fdca
just
now,
you
used
the
word
“
authorizes
”,
and
typically,
when
we
think
about
impossibility,
it's
not
enough
that
a
state
law
penalizes
what
federal
law
authorizes.
what
we
--
something
is
impossible
when
a
state
law
penalizes
what
federal
law
requires
or
maybe
--
or,
where
state
law
penalizes
what
federal
law
gives
you
a
right
to
do.
but
it's
not
enough
for
impossibility
that
state
law
penalizes
what
federal
law
permits.
and
it
seems
as
though
what
we
have
in
the
fdca
is
a
statute
that
authorizes,
that
says,
you
can
sell
this.
but
it
doesn't
say
you
must
sell
it,
and
it
doesn't
give
you
a
right
to
sell
it.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that
is
your
best
case,
but,
you
know,
there
are
quite
a
number
of
cases
where
we've
really
held
when
a
federal
law
permits
something,
typically,
a
state
can
do
more
if
it
wants
to.
justice
elena
kagan
i
mean,
that
suggests
that
there
is
an
obligation
of
the
federal
government.
if
there
is
one,
yes,
there's
a
conflict
and
yes,
there's
an
impossibility
defense.
but
if
there's
no
obligation,
if
all
there
is,
is
permission
from
the
federal
government,
where
do
you
get
the
impossibility
from?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
take
that
point,
mr.
yang.
i
take
that
point,
mr.
yang,
but
i
think
then
you're
--
you're
saying
something
quite
deep
about
the
fdca,
which
is
that
the
fdca
should
not
be
thought
of
as
merely
authorizing
drug
sales.
you're
saying
essentially
that
when
the
--
when
the
fda
does
what
it
does,
it's
saying
not
just
--
you
know,
you
can
do
this
if
you
want
to,
but
you
can
do
this
and
we
really
think
this
drug
ought
to
be
marketed.
so
that
when
states
take
action
against
that,
you
know,
it's
--
it's
a
conflict.
justice
elena
kagan
and
that's--
justice
elena
kagan
--and
that's
something
i
don't
think
we've
really
ever
said.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
frederick,
it
--
it
does
seem
to
me,
and
i
understand
that
there's
a
waiver
argument
floating
around
here,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
case
was
litigated
such
that
the
adequacy
of
the
warning
is
really
all
over
this
case.
there
was
expert
testimony
about
the
adequacy
of
the
warning,
there
were
jury
instructions
about
the
adequacy
of
the
warning.
in
the
closing
statements
that
the
lawyer
gave,
it
was
--
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
--
that
the
fda's
decision
to
change
the
label,
to
show
that
the
label
was
ineffective
before.
so
there
is
just
all
over
this
stuff
about
adequacy
of
the
warning,
which
does
suggest
that
this
is
sort
of
within
the
four
corners
of
mensing.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
how
can
that
be,
mr.
frederick,
because
the
plaintiff
really
spent
a
large
portion
of
their
case
trying
to
show
this,
that
the
warning
was
inadequate.
so
the
plaintiff
must
have
thought
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
if
the
warning
was
adequate,
the
jury
would
find
one
thing,
but
if
the
warning
was
not
adequate,
liability
would
follow.
justice
elena
kagan
there
is
no
such
thing
then
as
a
brand
name
manufacturer
can
change
some
design
features
of
the
drug,
you
know,
without
fda
approval
or
without
going
back
to
square
one
of
the
fda,
there's
nothing
like
that?
