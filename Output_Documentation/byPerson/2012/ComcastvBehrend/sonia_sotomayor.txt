mr.
estrada,
could
you
pronounce
for
me
or
give
me
the
legal
rule
as
you
want
us
to
articulate
it?
let
me
get
you
out
of
daubert,
okay,
because
i
think
you
really
can't
deny
that
you
never
raised
the
word
“
daubert
”
below
until
the
very
end.
your
fight
before
the
district
court
was
on
the
probity
of
the
model,
not
on
a
daubert
issue,
correct?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
did
you
use
the
word
“
daubert
”
before
the
district
court?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
so
you
didn't
use
“
daubert
”
below--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
let's
get
out
of
the
daubert
language,
okay?
tell
me
how
and
what
rule
we
announce
so
that
district
courts
find
an
expert's
evidence
probative,
the
other
side
argues
it's
not,
and
when
does
the
district
court
let
the
jury
decide
between
the
two?
where
is
the
line
that
the
district
court
draws
between
class
certification
and
merits
adjudication
so
that
at
some
point
it
goes
to
the
jury?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me,
do
you
think
--
that
--
that's
why
i
am
trying
to
get
away
from
magic
words.
why
do
you
disagree
with
the
simple
proposition
that
a
district
court,
by
whatever
magic
words
it
uses,
has
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
expert's
testimony
is
persuasive?
and
isn't
that
at
bottom
line
a
judgment
that
it's
reliable
and
probative?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
not
disagreeing
with
your
adversary
on
a
legal
standard.
every
judge
on
a
--
this
is
the
simple
way
i
formulate
the
rule
--
every
judge
before
he
certifies
--
he
or
she
certifies
a
class,
has
to
decide
whether
the
methods
being
used
are
probative
and
relevant,
sufficient
to
prove
common
--
common
question
of
damages.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
tell
me
--
you
articulate
for
me
what
you
think
--
what
the
district
court
found
when
it
accepted
your
expert's
theory
as
adequate.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
do
you
think
that
means
legally?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
so
what
does
sufficiently
persuasive
mean?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it
sounds
nice,
but
more
likely
than
not--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
the
bottom
line
is,
can
a
district
court
ever
say
that
it's
persuaded
by
unreliable
or
not
probative
evidence.
that's
really
the
bottom
line
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
does
it
commit
legal
error
when
it
finds
something
that's
unreliable
and
unpersuasive
or
unprobative?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
what
he
said--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--but
if
we're
answering
a
legal
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
problem
everyone's
having
is
--
i
think
--
that
why
do
you
need
daubert
to
point
out
that
something
is
not
probative
or
unreliable?
whether
it's
an
expert
or
a
lay
witness
testifying,
wouldn't
you
apply
that
same
standard
to
anybody's
testimony?
