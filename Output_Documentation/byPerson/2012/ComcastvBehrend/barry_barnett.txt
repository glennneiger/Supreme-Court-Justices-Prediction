mr.
barry
barnett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
kagan,
you
are
exactly
right,
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
framed
not,
as
counsel
just
misspoke,
in
terms
of
daubert,
but
it
was
framed
in
terms
of
whether
you
have
to
go
into
--
whether
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
to
deal
with
merits
issues,
and
that
question
was
what
was
reformulated.
and
to
get
a
sense
of
how
profoundly
uninterested
comcast
was
in
daubert
and
in
arguing
weight
and
probativeness
as
opposed
to
admissibility,
which
is
the
question
before
this
court,
they
never,
ever
cited
daubert.
they
didn't
cite
it
in
the
district
court,
they
didn't
cite
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
don't
think
it
is
a
magic
word
approach
at
all,
your
honor,
because
it
has
tremendous
significance
to
people
who
are
actually
litigating
the
case.
it's
--
i
submit
that
it
is
disrespectful
to
a
district
judge
not
to
object
on
daubert
grounds
and
then
complain
that
what
he
did
was
completely
unusable
in
the
court.
they
cited
daubert
and
rule
702,
50
--
i
quit
counting
at
50,
but
it
was
only
after
the
question
was
reframed
not
to
deal
with
merits
questions,
but
to
deal
with
daubert
specifically.
mr.
barry
barnett
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
barnett
that's
true.
mr.
barry
barnett
but,
justice
kennedy
it's
also
the
case
that
the
judge
saying,
"do
you
have
any
objections
to
this
witness
as
an
expert?
"
that's
about
as
big
an
invitation
you
can
get
that
if
you
have
got
a
daubert
objection,
you
better
make
it
now,
you
need
to
make
it
now.
mr.
barry
barnett
that
was--
mr.
barry
barnett
--the
second
step
is
using
the
--
the
court's
opinions
in
daubert,
as
well
as
in
carmichael,
as
well
as
in
joiner,
which
the
court
has
held
applies
to
all
kinds
of
expert
testimony
in
federal
court.
the
district
judge
has
an
obligation
to
serve
as
a
gatekeeper
whether
there
is
a
jury
in
the
box
or
not.
on
a
preliminary
injunction,
the
court,
if
there
is
a
proper
daubert
objection,
must
make
the
objection
at
that
time.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
completely
agree,
justice
sotomayor,
and
we
--
we
embrace
whatever
daubert
standard
anybody
wants
to
apply
retroactively.
but
the
main
point
is
judge
padova--
mr.
barry
barnett
--justice
sotomayor,
i
agree
with
that
proposition
if
such
that
there
is
a
proper
objection
made
such
that
the
district
court
is
put
on
notice
that
he
or
she
needs
to
do
the
work.
judge
padova
had
a
4-day
hearing,
heard
a
day
and
a
half
of
dr.
mcclave,
and
then
had
a
separate
hearing
to
ask
specific
questions
about,
what
about,
well
there
is
one
of
the
four
mechanisms
that
the
anticompetitive
conduct
translated
into
sky
high
prices
throughout
the
philadelphia
dma.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
and
again,
it's
not
magic
words.
trial
lawyers
--
and
i
have
been
on
this
case
for
almost
10
years
now
--
once
you
say
daubert,
once
you
say
702,
or
once
you
say
"i
object,
it's
not
reliable.
"
at
the
time,
contemporaneously,
the
district
judge
has
an
opportunity
to
fix
whatever
the
problem
is.
and
the
other
side
has
a
chance
to
fix
whatever
the
problem
is,
too.
mr.
barry
barnett
well,
it
--
it
certainly
is
not
an
admissibility
question.
so,
i
mean
that's
what
the
question
is
before
the
court.
that
is
definitely
not
an
admissibility
question,
it's
a
question
of
probativeness,
and
you
can
analyze
it
however
you
want
to
under
a
clearly
erroneous
test,
which
is
what
applies
both
under
a
daubert
standard
as
well
as
a
class
certification,
where
the
judge
is--
mr.
barry
barnett
--if
--
if
you
are
talking
about
at
the
hearing
for
the
class
certification--
mr.
barry
barnett
--as
opposed
to
a
trial.
mr.
barry
barnett
daubert--
mr.
barry
barnett
--if
it
is
unreliable
then
it
is
not
admissible.
mr.
barry
barnett
it
is
not
adequately
or
inadequately--
mr.
barry
barnett
--it's
--
okay,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
am
not
going
to
quibble
with
you
about
that,
but
this
case,
comcast,
at
the
heart
of
this
appeal
it's
comcast--
mr.
barry
barnett
--is
it
always
the
case?
mr.
barry
barnett
if
there
is
an
objection,
if
there
is
an
objection,
there
is
a
lot
of
authority--
mr.
barry
barnett
--i
--
i
am
unaware
of
any
time
this
court
has
said
it's
okay
not
to
object.
mr.
barry
barnett
your
honor,
i
agree
that
that's
one
of
the
options
that
your
honor
has,
but
of
course
it
goes
back
with
all
the
scuffs
and
scars
and
mess-ups
that
preceded
it
up
until
today.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
would
love
to
talk
about
the
model.
mr.
barry
barnett
yes,
i--
mr.
barry
barnett
--i
would
love
to
talk
about
this
model.
this--
mr.
barry
barnett
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do
have
to
show
that
this
is
a
fantastic
model,
which
it
is.
mr.
barry
barnett
all
right.
i
--
i
agree.
i
am
not
going
to
put
the
--
i
am
happy
with
whatever
test
you
all
want
to
apply
is
what
i'm
saying.
this
is
a
good
model.
and
two
of
the
basic
misconceptions
that
this
case
comes
into
this
court
with
is
first,
that
there
--
that
dr.
mcclave
was
talking
about
a
causal
connection
between
the
anticompetitive
conduct
and
the
damages.
he
was
estimating,
whatever
the
--
whatever
the
anticompetitive
conduct
is,
whatever
the
judge
or
jury
finds
is
the
anticompetitive
conduct
that
accounts
for
the
sky-high
prices
throughout
the
philadelphia
area
--
whatever
it
is,
this
is
an
accurate
reflection
of
the
damages
on
a
class-wide
basis
aggregated
across
the
class.
the
--
comcast--
mr.
barry
barnett
--and,
your
honor--
mr.
barry
barnett
--i
do
want
to
make
sure
i
--
i
make
the
correction.
dr.
williams
was
the
one
who
talked
about
this,
not
dr.
mcclave.
dr.
williams
was
the
one
who
said
this
is
the
anticompetitive
conduct
and
this
is
what
caused
there
to
be
less
competition.
it
was
dr.
mcclave's
job
to
figure
out,
well,
what's
the
harm
to
the
class
as
a
result
of
that
chain
of
events?
you
are
right,
your
honor,
that
--
justice
scalia,
that
judge
--
judge
padova
excluded
three
of
the
four
mechanisms
that
dr.
williams
talked
about
as
having
a
causal
connection.
and
it
turns
out
dr.
williams--
mr.
barry
barnett
--it
was
not,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
barnett
his
--
his
model
was
agnostic
about
what
the
anticompetitive
conduct
was.
mr.
barry
barnett
again,
i
want
to
make
sure
i
am
being
precise
about
this,
justice
scalia.
there
is
no
question
that
the
conduct
that
caused
the
harm
is
the
clustering
behavior
that
comcast
engaged
in
over
a
decade's
time.
what
is
not
clear,
was
not
clear
but
is
now,
because
judge
padova
has
told
us
which
of
the
mechanisms
that
dr.
williams
formulated
as
possible
causes
of
the
--
the
possible
engines
that
resulted
in
the
prices
going
way
up.
mr.
barry
barnett
exactly.
mr.
barry
barnett
exactly
right,
justice
breyer.
and
maybe
if
you
think
of
it
as
the
possibility
of
--
i
think
of
in
terms
of
engines.
there
is
an
engine
that
is
causing
something.
maybe
it's--
mr.
barry
barnett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
barnett
indeed.
mr.
barry
barnett
the
record
says
it
can
be
done.
in
fact--
mr.
barry
barnett
--i
would
--
would
cite
you
to
--
let's
see
if
i
can
find
it.
it's
in
--
actually
in
the
court
of
appeals
record
ao
01533
through
34.
it
is
stated
there
that
you
can
take
off
of
the
dbs
--
if
you
don't
like
the
dbs
penetration
screen,
then
you
can
turn
it
off
and
damages
are
still,
as
we
have
established
since
--
when
comcast
complied
--
when
they
finally
did
file
a
daubert
motion,
would
be
something
like
$550
million
on
a
class-wide
basis.
so
that
is
in
the
record
as
well
as
there
is
ample
evidence;
exhibit
82,
which
shows
23
different
iterations
of
the
damages
models
including
damages
models
that
dr.
chipty
on
the
comcast
side
put
together
slicing
and
dicing
all
of
this
data
to
show
that
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
and
dice
it
almost,
if
you
did
it
in
any
kind
of
a
fair
way
that
the
federal
judicial
center
recognizes
as
a
reliable
type
of
methodology
you
are
going
to
have
significant
damages
across
the
class
for
each
class
member
throughout
the
time
period.
the
other
thing
i
would
like--
mr.
barry
barnett
--no,
your
honor,
i
was
about
to
change
that
subject.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
--
i
do
not,
your
honor,
and
i
think
justice
--
judge
padova
got
it
exactly
right.
you
read
the
standard
that
he
applied.
in
fact,
if
anything,
it's
a
tougher
standard
than
should
be
the
test,
but
we
embrace
that
test
and
we
are
happy
about
it,
and
we
don't
disagree
with
mr.
estrada.
and
this
is
what
i
was
about
to
change
subject
to
a
little
bit,
the
two
misconceptions
that
fundamentally
affect
comcast's
view
of
the
world--
mr.
barry
barnett
--if
there
is
a
proper
objection,
properly
and
timely
presented,
it's
preserved
up
through
the
appellate
courts
and
all
the
things
that
you
need
to
do
in
order
to
be
fair
to
the
judge
as
well
as
make
sure
you
get
it
--
give
it
as
good
a
chance
to
be
right
as
possible,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
but
that's
a
lot
of
caveats
before
you
get--
mr.
barry
barnett
--well,
if
the
issue
of
admissibility
is
in
the
case,
i
don't
think
it
is.
if
evidence
comes
in
--
again,
this
is
--
this
was
not
a
bunch
of
expert
reports
that
were
just
piled
up
on
the
--
in
chambers
and
judge
padova
went
through
them.
he
actually,
at
their
request,
had
a
four-day
hearing,
and
then
a
fifth
day
where
he
posed
a
series
--
i
think
it
was
a
four-page
letter
where
the
judge
says,
"i'm
concerned
about
this,
i'm
concerned
about
that.
"
"y'all
come
back
and
tell
me
why
it's
okay.
"
mr.
barry
barnett
the
answer,
your
honor,
and
my
source
is
section
274
of
trial
and
corpus
juris
secundum,
well
recognized
in
this
court,
no
doubt.
it
says
that
if
it's
in
the
record,
if
it
comes
in
unobjected
to,
it
has
whatever
probative
value
the
court
--
the
trier-of-fact
chooses
to
place
on
it.
mr.
barry
barnett
no,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
barnett
what's
happening,
your
honor,
is
you
have
got
to
satisfy
--
rule
23(b)(3)
says
the
judge
has
to
make
findings.
that's
the
one
of
the
few
parts
of
rule
23
that
talks
about
findings.
mr.
barry
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
but
he's
acting
as
a
gatekeeper,
and
what
he's
doing
or
she's
doing
is
projecting:
what's
this
trial
going
to
look
like
based
on
the
evidence
in
front
of
me.
mr.
barry
barnett
absolutely.
he
does.
mr.
barry
barnett
justice
kennedy,
the
district
judge
asks:
prove
to
me
--
to
the
plaintiff,
that
you
can
prove
it
at
trial.
prove
to
me
now
that
at
trial
you
will
be
able
to
submit
a
damages
model
that
passes
muster,
under
daubert
or
whatever
test
there
is,
depending
on
what
the
objections
are.
so
the
judge
is
acting
in
a
gatekeeper
role
right
then,
kind
of
projecting
into
the
future
about
what
am
i
going
to
do
when
the
jury's
in
the
box--
mr.
barry
barnett
--and
the
finding
that
the
judge
makes
based
on
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
plaintiffs
have
shown
to
me
that
more
likely
than
not,
at
trial,
plaintiffs
will
be
able
to
show
on
a
class-wide
basis,
some
evidence,
enough
to
get
a
verdict
that
could
be
upheld,
enough
that
satisfies
to
some
evidence
or
whatever
the
test
is
at
trial,
that
shows
damages
on
a
class-wide
basis.
so
the
judge
isn't
saying:
this
is
it,
you
can't
fix
it,
you
can't
change
it,
you
can't
modify
it,
you
can't
enhance
it
between
now
and
trial.
he
says
that
you
can
do
it.
you
have
shown
to
me,
to
my
satisfaction,
that
more
likely
than
not
that
the
evidence
that
you
will
present
to
the
jury
at
trial
is
going
to
be
admissible
and
it's
going
to
be
sufficiently
persuasive
if
the
jury
chooses
to
accept
it.
and
this
is
where
--
i
really
want
to
get
to
this
about
the
merits.
i
think
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion
about
what
judge
aldisert
meant
in
the
third
circuit
when
he
talked
about
the
merits.
comcast,
each
time
construes,
when
he
uses
the
word
“
merits
”,
talk
about
incantation
of
magic
words,
that
that
means
whether
it's
good
or
bad,
that
that
is
what
judge
aldisert
was
talking
about.
that
is
not
what
he
was
talking
about
at
all.
he
was
talking
about
trial
on
the
merits.
he
was
saying
that
right
now
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
this
model
is
perfect.
it's
enough.
the
test
--
this
issue
isn't
before
us
because
it's
been
waived,
daubert
and
all
that,
but
if
you
want
to
know
what
our
observation
would
be
if
this
were
presented
in
a
proper
case,
then
observation
is
it
doesn't
have
to
be
perfect,
and
it
can
be
enhanced
between
now
--
which
is
supposed
to
happen
at
an
early,
practicable
time
--
and
trial,
so
that
the
jury
can
see
it.
mr.
barry
barnett
what
judge--
mr.
barry
barnett
--what
judge
padova
found
was
that
the
mcclave
damages
model
is
persuasive
to
him,
sufficiently
persuasive
to
him
that
it
could
be
used
at
trial
to
prove
damages
on
a
class-wide
basis.
mr.
barry
barnett
that
more
likely
than
not--
mr.
barry
barnett
--more
likely
than
not
that
it
will
be
admissible
at
trial,
and
it
will
meet
the
standard
that's
required
to
get
to
a
verdict.
not
that
it's
i'm
convinced
that
you're
right.
and
that's
what
judge
aldisert
was
talking
about.
he
said:
it's
not
time
for
us
to
say
comcast
wins
or
plaintiffs
win
based
on
all
this
evidence;
the
only
thing
that's
really
before
the
court
is
whether
more
likely
than
not
the
plaintiffs
have
presented
a
model
--
we're
talking
about
a
model
in
this
case;
it
could
be
a
different
issue
in
a
different
case.
in
than
the
amgen
case
that's
coming
up
it
could
be
a
different
issue.
mr.
barry
barnett
at
this
time,
your
honor,
i
think
--
i
think
it
has
no
bearing
on
what
this
court
does
or
does
not
do
in
this
case.
it
is
something
that
we
would
have
the
right
to
appeal
at
an
appropriate
time,
but
we're
not
doing
that
now.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
would
not
say
that.
and
partly--
mr.
barry
barnett
--well,
the
reason
i'm
hesitating
is
because--
mr.
barry
barnett
--well
--
and
also,
it's
because
it's
something
you
don't
know.
when
that
word
was
used,
“
unusable
”,
in
court,
they
were
talking
about
common
impact.
that's
what
that
was
about.
that
was
--
that
discussion
was
about,
it
wasn't
about
this
model.
mr.
barry
barnett
and
judge
padova
could
have
done
that,
but
he
didn't
do
that.
i
think
he
was
persuaded
by
the
evidence
that
dr.
mcclave
put
on
and
he
rejected,
because
we
know
from
his
81-page
opinion
that
he
rejected
an
awful
lot
of
what
comcast's
experts
said.
so
he
--
he
could
have
made
that
determination.
and
this
is
why
it's
an
--
if
we're
talking
--
if
we're
not
dealing
just
with
an
admissibility
issue
that's
been
forfeited
away,
we're
dealing
with
abuse
of
discretion
and
clearly
erroneous.
and
this
is--
mr.
barry
barnett
--your
honor,
if
you're
in
a
trial
court
and
somebody
says
daubert
or
somebody
says
rule
702
or
somebody
says
i
object
to
this
expert's
testimony,
that
has
profound
significance.
and
again,
i
think
it's
--
it's
almost
disrespectful
to
the
district
court
to
say,
"it's
okay,
although
this
--
this
question
wasn't
on
the
test
that
you
had
when
you
were
trying
to
decide
the
case,
we're
going
to
add
the
question
to
the
test,
and
by
the
way,
you
flunked
it.
"
that's
not
fair.
mr.
barry
barnett
i--
mr.
barry
barnett
--well,
your
honor,
i
agree,
and
of
course
that's
not
the
issue
in
the
case,
because
judge
padova
was
convinced
it
was
reliable.
and
there's
plenty
of
proof
that
there
was.
mr.
barry
barnett
right.
mr.
barry
barnett
we're
talking
about
the
--
the
edges
and
all
the
--
where
everything
is
done
properly
below.
if
it
doesn't
pass
muster
under
daubert,
whatever
the
test
is,
let's
not
reformulate
it
here,
i
suppose,
yes,
then
it's
not
admissible.
mr.
barry
barnett
justice
sotomayor,
let
me
just
give
you
an
example.
there
were
a
bunch
of
issues
that
the
dissenting
judge
raised,
including
the
overbuilding
screen,
a
particular
kind
of
market
screen,
mathematical
averages.
if
in
the
dbs
penetration
screen,
if
he
had
raised
any
of
those,
if
there
had
been
a
whisper
of
a
hint
of
a
suggestion,
of
a
thought
of
the
those
things
in
the
district
court,
we'd
have
been
all
over
that,
and
we
would
have
proved
that
it
was
false,
that
those
--
that
those
statements
are
untrue.
and
we
know
that's
accurate
because,
as
i
just
read
to
you
from
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
record,
the
dbs
screen
can
in
fact
be
taken
off,
eliminated
from
the
sample,
and
you
still
have
$550
million
worth
of
damages
on
a
class-wide
basis.
mr.
barry
barnett
and
the
reason
we
got
to
that
is
because
they
finally
did,
on
the
eve
of
trial,
file
an
actual
daubert
motion,
and
that
was
our
response,
and
they
cited
footnote
323
of
their
brief.
mr.
barry
barnett
it
depends
on
the
time
of
day,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
barnett
i
would--
mr.
barry
barnett
--justice
scalia,
i
would
say
what
you're
doing
is
what
i
suggest
the
court
ought
to
do.
everybody
knows
that
district
judges
have
broad
discretion
in
a
lot
of
different
things
that
they
do.
you
just
made
it
this
much
bigger
as
a
result
of
saying,
"we're
not
even
going
to
bother
with
the
daubert
thing,
we're
going
to
trust
that
the
district
judge
is
not
going
to
be
persuaded
by
phony
evidence,
and
we're
going
to
trust,
if
he
gets
it
nearly
close,
right,
that
he
got
it
right.
"
