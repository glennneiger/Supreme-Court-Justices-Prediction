justice
elena
kagan
mr.
estrada,
doesn't
justice
ginsburg's
question
actually
point
out
that
the
--
the
law
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
used
in
this
case
was
actually
quite
favorable
to
you.
unlike
some
courts,
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
said
that
the
plaintiffs
needed
to
show
that
there
was
a
class-wide
measurement
of
damages.
and
then
in
addition,
both
courts
said
really,
it
was
--
the
burden
was
on
the
plaintiffs
to
demonstrate
that
that
class-wide
measure
of
damages
existed.
now,
i
understand
that
you
have
problems
with
the
way
in
which
the
plaintiffs
met
that
burden.
you
say
that
they
didn't
meet
that
burden.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
legal
standard
that
was
used
was
exactly
the
legal
standard
that
you
wanted,
that
the
plaintiffs
had
to
come
in
and
show
by
a
preponderance
that
they
had
a
class-wide
way
to
measure
damages
in
this
case.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
here's
what
the
district
court
said.
"the
experts'
opinions
raise
substantial
issues
of
fact
and
credibility
that
we
are
required
to
resolve
to
decide
the
pending
motion.
"
that
is
the
motion
for
class
certification.
"having
rigorously
analyzed
the
experts'
reports,
we
conclude
that
the
class
has
met
its
burden
to
demonstrate
that
the
elements
of
antitrust
impact
is
capable
of
proof
at
trial
through
evidence
that
is
common
to
the
class,
and
that
there
is
a
common
methodology
available
to
measure
and
quantify
damages
on
a
class-wide
basis.
"
so
that
seems
to
me
exactly
what
you
say
they
should
have
done.
now,
you
disagree
with
their
ultimate
determination,
but
not
with
the
statement
of
the
law.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.--
justice
elena
kagan
--mr.
estrada,
as
--
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
i
guess
i
wonder
why
any
of
this
is
relevant.
you
mentioned
earlier,
you
mentioned
earlier
that
we
reformulated
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
and
we
reformulated
in
a
way
which
said
that
what
we
wanted
to
talk
about
was
whether
a
district
court
at
a
class
certification
stage
has
to
conduct
a
daubert
inquiry,
in
other
words
has
to
decide
on
the
admissibility
of
expert
testimony
relating
to
class-wide
damages.
and,
you
know,
it
would
not
be
crazy
to
surmise
that
we
reformulated
the
question
because
we
wanted
to
present,
we
wanted
to
decide
a
legal
question,
rather
than
a
question
about
who
was
right
as
to
this
particular
expert's
report
and
how
strong
it
was.
and
it
turns
out
that
as
to
that
legal
question,
your
clients
waived
their
--
their
argument
that
this
was
inadmissible
evidence.
so
--
so
what
do
we
do
in
that
circumstance?
justice
elena
kagan
the
district
court,
mr.
estrada,
clearly
understood
you
to
be
making
an
argument
about
weight
and
not
about
admissibility.
and
indeed
the
district
court
in
open
court
--
and
--
and
it's
in
the
transcript
--
suggests
that
it's
doing
something
different
from
holding
a
daubert
hearing,
explains
how
it's
different
from
holding
a
daubert
hearing,
and
both
lawyers
agree
to
that
statement.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
estrada,
it
seems
like
a
remarkable
proposition,
honestly,
especially
with
a
client
like
yours
that
is
well
lawyered.
it
seems
like
a
remarkable
proposition
that
somebody
--
a
party
can
say,
we
have
objections
about
the
weight
of
this
evidence.
we
don't
think
--
we
don't
think
it's
a
strong
expert
report,
and
that
--
and
that
we
--
and
that
the
court
should
then
infer
that
there
is
an
objection
to
admissibility
of
evidence
as
opposed,
again,
to
the
weight
and
strength
of
evidence.
i
mean,
surely
a
district
court
confronted
with
an
argument
about
the
weight
and
strength
of
evidence
does
not
have
to
say:
oh,
i
better
go
hold
a
daubert
hearing
to
rule
on
admissibility
even
though
nobody's
asked
me--
justice
elena
kagan
--to
rule
on
admissibility.
justice
elena
kagan
did
you
ever
file
a
motion
to
strike
the
expert
report?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
barnett,
it's
always
true,
isn't
it,
that
evidence
that
is
inadequately
probative
is
inadmissible?
justice
elena
kagan
it's
always
been
true,
right,
if
evidence
is
not--
justice
elena
kagan
--if
that's
the
case.
i
mean,
but
have
we
ever
said
that
--
that
without
an
objection
somebody
can
say,
look,
we
--
we
argued
about
this
evidence
and
that
should
be
just
good
enough,
even
though
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
make
an
objection
to
exclude
it?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
barnett
--
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
justice
elena
kagan
okay.
then
i
will.
i
am
still
in
search
of
a
legal
question
that
anybody
disagrees
about
here.
you
know,
i
read
before
the
district
court
statement
of
the
standard,
now
all
points
of
the
circuit
court
statement
of
the
standard,
where
the
circuit
court
says,
"the
inquiry
for
a
district
court
at
the
class
certification
stage
is
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
demonstrated.
"
--burden
is
on
you
--
"by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
they
will
be
able
to
measure
damages
on
a
class-wide
basis
using
common
proof.
"
the
parties
both
agree
with
that
statement
of
the
standard.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
parties
also
both
agree,
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
that
if
the
daubert
question
had
not
been
waived,
that
if
--
if
comcast
had
objected
to
the
admissibility
of
this
expert
report,
that
indeed,
the
court
would
--
should
have
held
a
hearing
on
the
admissibility
of
the
expert
report.
so
this
is
a
case
where
it
seems
to
me
that
except
for
the
question
of
how
good
the
expert
report
is,
none
of
the
parties
have
any
adversarial
difference
as
to
the
appropriate
legal
standard.
and,
you
know,
usually
we
decide
cases
based
on
disagreements
about
law,
and
here
i
can't
find
one.
is
there
any?
do
you
disagree
with
mr.
estrada
on
any
statement
of
the
legal
standard?
