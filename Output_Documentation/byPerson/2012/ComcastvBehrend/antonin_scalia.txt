we
must
have
thought
that,
i
suppose,
or
else
we
wouldn't
have
reformulated
the
question
this
way,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
way
you
put
the
question
initially,
and
we
reformulated
it
to
be
a
daubert
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
--
you
are
saying
it's
inadmissible
if
it's
inadequately
probative,
right?
so
your
objections
boil
down
to
the
same,
don't
they?
if
it's
inadequately
probative,
it's
inadmissible,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whenever.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
what,
what
is
the
criterion
for
daubert?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
adequately
probative?
if
not
it's
inadmissible.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
want
to
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
say
unreliable,
i
say
inadequately
probative.
it's
--
it
is
unreliable
because
it
is
inadequately
probative.
justice
antonin
scalia
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
didn't
say
what
--
there
--
there
were
four
possibilities
that
he
took
into
account,
right,
as
to
what
the
anticompetitive
conduct
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
as
it
turns
out,
only
one
of
those
was
found
to
--
to
be
in
the
game.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
the
basis
for
the
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
not
the
basis?
his
was
based
only
on
the
one
that
the
court
accepted?
where
in
the
record
is
--
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
be
agnostic
about
what
the
anticompetitive
conduct
is,
if
you
are
going
to
do
--
if
you're
going
to
do
an
analysis
of
what
are
the
consequences
of
the
--
of
the
anticompetitive
conduct,
you
have
to
know
the
anticompetitive
conduct
you
are
talking
about.

mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
barnett,
suppose
--
suppose
we
held
that
where
--
where
there's
a
bench
trial,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
--
what
--
whether
the
judge
excludes
the
evidence
under
daubert.
i
never
know
how
to
say
it.
is
it
daubert
or
daubert?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
think
you're
right.
it
doesn't
make
a
dime's
worth
of
difference
whether
the
judge
excludes
it
under
--
under
daubert
or
proceeds
to
find
it
simply
unreliable
--
unreliable.
suppose
--
suppose
we
held
that.
what
difference
would
it
make
in
the
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
trial
judge
could
say,
"yes,
i
have
a
daubert
motion,
but
--
but
i'm
going
to
defer
that.
"
"i'm
just
going
to

proceed
to
see
whether
this

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
comcast
corporation
and
its
subsidiaries
provide
cable
television
services.
from
1998
to
2007,
they
allegedly
engaged
in
the
series
of
transactions
that
the
parties
have
described
as
“clustering.”
a
strategy
of
concentrating
up
their
operations
in
a
particular
region
that
included
16
counties
located
in
pennsylvania,
delaware,
and
new
jersey.
what
they
would
do
is
buy
out
other
companies
in
that
area
or
trade-off
a
company
in
that
area
for
one
of
their
own
elsewhere.
respondents
are
subscribers
to
comcast's
cable
services.
they
filed
the
class-action,
alleging
violations
of
federal
antitrust
laws,
mainly
that
the
clustering
scheme
harms
the
subscribers
in
the
region
by
eliminating
competition
and
holding
prices
for
cable
services
above
competitive
levels.
respondent
sought
to
certify
a
class
of
more
than
two
million
people
pursuant
to
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23
(b)(3).
that
rule
permits
certification
only
if
“the
court
finds
that
the
questions
of
law
or
fact
common
to
class
members
predominate
over
any
questions
affecting
only
individual
members.”
the
district
court
held
and
it
is
--
it
was
uncontested
in
this
case
that
to
meet
the
predominance
requirement,
respondents
had
to
show,
one,
that
the
individual
injury
resulting
from
the
alleged
antitrust
violation,
referred
to
as
a
“antitrust
impact,”
was
capable
of
proof
at
trial
through
evidence
that
was
common
to
the
class,
rather
than
different
for
the
individual
members.
and
two,
that
the
damages
resulting
from
that
injury
were
measurable
on
a
classwide
basis
through
the
use
a
common
methodology.
respondents
proposed
four
theories
of
antitrust
impact.
one,
comcast's
clustering
resulted
in
decreased
market
penetration
by
direct
broadcast
satellite
providers.
number
two,
comcast
reduced
the
level
of
competition
from
overbuilders
that
is
companies
that
build
cable
networks
in
areas
where
an
incumbent
cable
company
already
exists.
three,
comcast
reduced
the
level
of
benchmark
competition
on
which
cable
customers
rely
to
compare
prices.
and
four,
comcast's
clustering
increased
its
bargaining
power
relative
to
content
providers.
each
of
these
forms
of
impact,
respondents
alleged,
increased
cable
subscription
rates
throughout
the
region.
the
district
court
accepted
only
one
of
those
four
theories
on
antitrust
impact.
as
capable
of
classwide
proof,
namely,
the
theory
that
comcast
activities
reduced
the
level
of
competition
from
overbuilders.
proceeding
then
to
the
second
question,
the
question
of
damages,
the
district
court
found
that
damages
could
also
be
calculated
on
a
classwide
basis.
and
so
concluding,
however,
the
district
court
relied
on
an
expert
model
that
did
not
isolate
damages
resulting
form
any
one
theory
of
antitrust
impact.
that
is
to
say
it
calculated
the
damages
attributable
to
all
four
of
the
alleged
antitrust
impacts
described
earlier.
the
district
court
certified
the
class
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals
saw
no
need
for
respondents
to
tie
each
theory
of
antitrust
impact
to
a
calculation
of
damages
attributable
to
that
impact
because,
the
court
said,
that
would
involve
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
antitrust
claim
which
has
no
place,
it
said,
in
the
class-certification
inquiry.
we
granted
certiorari
and
today
reverse.
the
class-action
was
improperly
certified
under
rule
23
(b)(3)
by
refusing
to
entertain
arguments
against
respondent's
damages
model
that
bore
on
the
propriety
of
class-certification
simply
because
those
arguments
would
also
be
pertinent
to
the
merits
determination.
the
court
of
appeals
ran
a
file
of
our
clear
precedence
requiring
precisely
that
inquiry.
and
it
is
clear
that
under
the
proper
standard
for
evaluating
certification,
respondents'
model
falls
far
short
of
establishing
that
damages
are
capable
of
measurement
on
a
classwide
basis.
that
is
because
as
i
have
described,
the
model
did
not
even
attempt
to
calculate
the
damages
resulting
from
reduced
overbuilder
competition.
the
only
theory
of
antitrust
impact
accepted
for
class-action
treatment
by
the
district
court.
respondents
contend
at
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
model
was
adequate,
was
a
finding
of
fact
that
we
must
accept.
we
think
at
no
more
a
finding
of
fact
than
is
a
district
court's
determination
of
what
--
one
of
our
our
opinions
holds.
and
even
if
it
were
a
finding
of
fact,
it
would
be
so
obviously
and
exceptionally
erroneous
that
we
need
not
accept
it.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
reversed.
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
breyer
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
sotomayor
and
justice
kagan
joined.
