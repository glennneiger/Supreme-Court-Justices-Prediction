justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
completely
agree
with
hornbook
law.
three
pipe
manufacturers
get
together
and
in
january
fix
their
prices,
all
right?
fourteen
wholesalers
want
to
show
that
and
each
has
different
damages
because
they
bought
different
amounts
of
pipe.
hornbook
law:
certify
the
class
and
leave
the
damages
issues
for
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
case,
this
case,
hornbook
law:
section
2
forbids
monopolization.
it
is
absolutely
clear
comcast
has
that
power.
that's
why
they're
--
that's
why
they're
regulated
and,
indeed,
they
engage
in
things
that
show
that
they
did
not
achieve
that
through
skill,
foresight
and
industry.
what
things?
and
now
we
have
a
list
of
four
and
the
district
court
says
exactly
what?
if
we
prove
monopolization,
which
is
relevant
to
all
these
people
in
the
class,
then
what
we
do
is
we
later
look
into
how
much
that
monopolization
raised
the
prices
above
competitive
levels.
and
i
offer
a
model
to
look
at
the
competitive
levels
and
look
at
what
happened
over
here
and
there
we
are,
it
will
help.
okay?
now,
hornbook
law,
whether
that's
so
or
not
so
is
a
matter
for
later,
but
see
first
if
there
is
liability.
okay,
that's
their
argument.
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
here,
since
what
they
are
saying
is
they
have
two
theories:
section
1,
the
agreements
to
keep
other
people
out
of
this
area
are
unlawful
in
themselves.
question
2
is
whether
they
contribute
to
monopolization.
okay?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
the
legal
issue
of
liability.
now,
if
they're
right,
why
isn't
the
measure
of
damages
just
what
you
said?
we
look
to
the
people
who
are
subject
to
the
monopoly
power,
and
we
work
out
how
much
above
the
competitive
level
they
had
to
pay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
some
paid
some,
some
paid
another.
we
have
some
experts
in
to
try
to
make
that
computation.
sounds
the
same
to
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
saw
the
four
theories
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
now
on
the
theory
of
one
of
the
pieces
of
exclusionary
conduct
was
agreement
through
various
mergers,
et
cetera,
that
potential
competitors
would
not
come
in
and
compete.
now,
i
don't
know
why
the
judge
struck
out
the
other
one,
the
number
2,
but
number
3
and
number
4,
i
can
see
it.
but
on
monopolization
theory,
that's
not
relevant
to
damages.
throughout
we
assume
that
the
regulator
is
doing
a
terrible
job,
otherwise
the
prices
wouldn't
be
so
high
in
the
first
place.
but
what's
the
difference
in
this
case?
i
just
didn't
hear
it,
and
i
put
that
to
show
you
how
it
seemed
to
me
there
is
very
similar.
the
difference--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that's
liability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
have
the
right
to
prove
that
they
weren't,
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
this
does,
too--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
if
they
prove
their
case,
the
question
on
damages
is
to
what
extent
did
the
absence
of
competition
from
the
overbuilders
--
and
it
should
have
been
dbs
too
from
reading
this,
but
nonetheless
let
me
express
no
view
on
that
--
but
on
--
on
--
to
what
extent
did
the
failure
of
competition
from
those
people
raise
price
above
the
competitive
level?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
pipes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
strongest
argument
i
think
for
that
point
of
view
would
be
simply
this,
the
sniff
company
makes
widgets.
the
plaintiff
says
they
monopolize
the
widget
business.
that
business
is
monopolized
because
they
achieved
the
power
to
raise
price
above
the
competitive
level
through
exclusionary
practices.
for
example,
united
fruit
used
to
pour
garbage
on
the
ships
of
its
competitors.
now
we
have
here
a
class
of
people
who
have
been
injured
by
their
monopoly
power
--
and
here
they
are,
and
you
give
a
list.
the
judge
says
or
the
other
side,
how
do
you
know
that's
the
right
list?
well,
we
know;
here's
how
we
know.
we
have
an
expert
here
who
has
used
a
model
to
pick
out
the
right
people
who
were
injured
by
the
monopoly
power,
its
exercise.
and
the
other
side
says
no,
that
model
is
no
good.
well,
if
it
genuinely
is
no
good,
and
really
worthless,
then
i
guess
you
haven't
shown
these
are
the
right
people
for
the
class.
and
i
think
that's
what
they're
saying.
and
so
the
response
to
that
is,
to
answer
this
question,
do
we
have
to
go
look
at
the
model?
i
mean
on
its
face,
it
seems
okay.
i
don't
know,
i
haven't
looked
at
the
record.
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--could
you
talk
about
that
a
little
bit,
please?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
i
get
my
analysis
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
that
isn't
what
i
want
to
really
know.
[laughter]
i
want
to
know
--
if
you
think
of
the
examples
i
just
--
as
the
plaintiff,
when
you
draw
up
your
list
of
class
members,
you
have
to
have
on
that
list
people
who
really
were
hurt
by
the
--
or
plausibly
were
hurt
by
the
exercise
of
market
power,
and
you
have
to
have
some
way
of
picking
them
out,
and
you
have
chosen
this
model
as
a
way.
so,
i
guess
they
could
object
on
the
ground
that
model
is
worthless.
is
this
analysis
right?
and
you
would
have
to
show
no,
it
isn't
worthless.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
show
that
much.
i
think
you
only
have
to
show
it's
a
plausible
model.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
in
a
monopolization
case
it
is
not
the
case
that
you
have
to
trace
the
damages
to
the
exclusionary
conduct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
classical
class
of
--
section
2
case,
the
damages
are
caused
by
the
monopolization,
which
lacks
skill,
foresight
and
industry
justification.
so
the
fact
that
he
omitted
three
but
kept
one
has
nothing
to
do
with
damages
in
the
classical
section
2
case,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
here
is
the
difficulty
that
i
am
having.
a
little
technical,
but
--
but
it
--
this
is
a
regulated
industry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
because
it's
a
regulated
industry,
the
regulator
in
your
view
is
doing
one
of
the
worst
jobs
in
history.
they
are
willing
to
come
in
and
overbuild
and
everything,
so
he
must
be
letting
prices
--
all
right.
suppose
the
judge
or
lawyer
were
to
find:
that's
okay,
doesn't
matter,
all
we're
interested
in
is
what
justice
scalia
says.
then
if
that
were
true,
from
looking
at
the
footnote
on
this,
i
guess
you'd
take
this
model
and
you
would
simply
subtract
or
add
to
the
base,
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
competitively
priced
districts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
districts
that
also
have
satellite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that
shouldn't
be
tough
to
do
but
i
don't
know
if
it's
tough
to
do
and
i
don't
see
how
we're
ever
going
to
find
out.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know.
how
would
you
answer
such
a
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
is
that
what
learned
hand
said?
is
--
is
that
what
alcoa
holds,
is
that
united
fruit
holds
when
they
bomb
their
competitor's
ship
and
achieve
monopolization
that
the
only
people
who
can
get
damages
are
the
people
who
run
the
ship
and
were
bombed--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--who
bought
those
bananas?
i
didn't
know
that.
but
besides,
if
you're
right,
which
i
tend
to
doubt,
but
i'll
look
it
up,
if
you're
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
all
right.
fine.
i'll
look
that
up.
if
you're
right
and
as
they
pointed
out,
it's
still
one
of
the
easiest
things
in
the
world
to
simply
change
the
base
for
this
model.
instead
of
the
base
being
those
businesses
or
homeowners
who
received
their
service
at
competitive
prices,
we
say
--
we
modify
it
by
including
those
who
received
services
where
dbs
was
involved,
and
that'll
be
a
higher
price
and
we
subtract
that
price
from
the
price
they
paid
where
there
was
overbuilding
threatened.
now,
that'll
be
a
new
number.
they
say
it
was
a
new
number.
and
i
think
anybody
running
a
model
could
do
that,
but
i
promise
you
i
don't
know.
and
to
know
whether
you're
right
on
that
or
they're
right,
i
will
have
to
get
into
the
model-building
business
where
i
am
not
an
expert.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
this
dissent,
the
others
agree
with
justice
ginsburg
and
i
will
try
in
a
minute
to
explain
why
i
think
when
we
ignore
our
usual
procedure
of
practice
is
we
risk
going
quite
seriously
wrong
of
a
substantive
subject
here
as
monopolization.
so,
to
explain
and
imagine
a
roughly
analogous
case,
suppose
a
plaintiff
were
to
claim
that
the
defendant
company
through
exclusionary
practices
had
obtained
90%
of
the
market
for
the
product
in
california.
and
the
defendant
says,
“well,
california
buyers
because
of
that
are
paying
13%
more
for
the
products
in
buyers
in
other
places.”
then
the
plaintiff
introduces
an
expert
and
he
produces
a
model.
and
the
model
shows
that
california
buyers
pay
13%
more
for
the
product
than
others
do
and
that
the
explanation
after
he
goes
through
all
the
possibilities
are
that
the
defendant
does
exercise
unlawful
monopoly
power
in
california.
that's
why
they're
paying
more.
now,
that
model,
everybody
i
think
would
say,
is
at
least
evidence
that
the
california
buyers
were
hurt
and
they
constitute
an
appropriate
class
of
plaintiffs.
however,
many
there
are
who
wants
to
buy
the
product.
now,
the
case
before
us,
in
our
view,
in
the
dissent
does
not
differ
meaningfully
from
that
example
and
the
court
doesn't
agree
with
that.
that's
because
they
think
the
model
works
differently.
the
court
points
out
that
the
plaintiffs
did
give
four
reasons
or
theories
why
other
firms
found
it
difficult
to
enter
the
market
here
in
philadelphia.
and
the
district
court
did
strike
three
of
those
reasons
or
theories
as
being
invalid.
now,
the
court
says,
“that
back
means
they
have
to
reconsider
the
model,”
but
the
district
court
found
explicitly
that
removal
from
of
the
three
theories
or
reasons
or
whatever
they
were
from
the
case
didn't
have
anything
to
with
the
model.
its
creation
was
not
premised
on
their
viability.
in
the
district
courts
words,
“whether
or
not
we
accepted
all
four
theories
is
inapposite
to
dr.
mcclave's
methods
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that.”
how
dr.
mcclave's
model
actually
works
is
a
matter
of
fact.
we
don't
normally
disturb
findings
of
fact
in
which
two
courts
below
have
concurred
and
having
looked
to
that
model
is
like
--
he
had
to
do.
i
believe
those
lower
courts
were
actually
right
when
they
held
here
as
a
matter
of
how
the
model
work,
but
like
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
at
a
minimum
and
that's
the
more
general
point,
at
a
minimum,
we
should
not
hold
to
the
contrary
without
having
the
benefit
of
the
parties
argued
the
point
specifically.
