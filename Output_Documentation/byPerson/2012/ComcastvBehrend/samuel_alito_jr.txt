justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
in
this
case
why
doesn't
the
question
of
probative
value
subsume
the
daubert
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
the
problem
is
--
let
me
ask
my
question
in
a
different
way.
if
the
problem
is
that
the
model
that
is
being
--
that
was
used
by
the
expert
does
not
fit
the
theory
of
liability
that
remains
in
the
case,
would
that
--
what
is
the
difference
in
determining
probative
value
there
and
determining
whether
it
comes
in
under
daubert?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
before
you
do
that,
let
me
ask
a
question
related
to
what
justice
kagan
just
asked.
if
we
were
to
answer
the
question
presented
as
reformulated,
i
take
it
your
answer
would
be
that
a
district
court
under
those
circumstances
may
not
certify
a
class
action;
is
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
then
the
only
remaining
question
is
whether
the
issue
was
in
the
case
as
a
factual
--
as
a
matter
of
the
record
here;
isn't
that
right?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
could
this
report
be
probative
if
it
did
not
satisfy
daubert?
