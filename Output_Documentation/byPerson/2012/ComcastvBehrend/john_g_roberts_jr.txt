chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-864,
comcast
corporation
v.
behrend.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
are
having
an
elaborate
discussion,
and
you
did
in
--
in
the
briefs
about
whether
or
not
this
was
a
claim
that
was
waived
below.
no
court
has
addressed
that
yet.
we're
a
court
of
review,
not
first
view.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
one
option
for
the
court,
since
we
did
reformulate
the
question,
is
to
answer
the
question
and
then
send
it
back
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
parties
adequately
preserved
that
option
or
not
--
that
objection
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
fine.
i
mean,
and
the
district
court
presumably
can
decide
based
on
the
proceedings
and
all
that
below,
all
the
scars
and
mess-ups,
whether
or
not
it
was
adequately
preserved
or
not.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
your
answer
to
justice
sotomayor,
which
is
whether
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
this
will
be
something
that
can
be
used
at
trial,
one
way
to
capture
that
is
whether
or
not
this
evidence
is
usable,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
more
likely
than
not
whether
it
can
be
used
at
trial,
that
sounds
like
is
it
usable.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know
the
reason
you're
hesitating.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
estrada,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-864,
comcast
corporation
versus
behrend.
