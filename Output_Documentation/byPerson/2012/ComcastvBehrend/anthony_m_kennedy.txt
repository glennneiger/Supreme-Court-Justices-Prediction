are
there
cases
in
the
--
in
the
ordinary
course
of
class
actions
--
i
know
they
are
all
different
--
where
the
district
court
can
find
that
common
questions
do
predominate
without
addressing
the
question
whether
damages
can
be
proven
on
a
class-wide
basis,
or
are
they
always
interlinked?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
my
--
one
of
my
questions
in
the
case
is
this.
there
was
a
question
to
mr.
estrada
with
reference
to
a
jury
trial,
but
the
judge
doesn't
really
have
a
gate
--
what
do
you
call
it,
a
gatekeeper
function
here.
there
is
no
--
there's
no
jury.
and
if
the
judge
admits
the
evidence
and
if
it
turns
out
that
that
doesn't
meet
the
standard
of
reliability,
then
he
can
exclude
it.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
why
the
judge
has
to
say:
all
right,
now
first
i'm
going
to
do
daubert,
and
next
i'm
going
to
do
whether
this
is
reliable.
this
is
just
a
magic
words
approach,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
take
it
there
is
no
argument
over
whether
or
not
the
expert
is
qualified.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
question
is
just
whether
his
--
his
theory
makes
any
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
petitioner
says
it
doesn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
--
i
can
think
of
--
my
initial
reaction
--
it
has
been
an
awful
long
time
since
i
have
been
in
the
courtroom
--
is
that
that's
whether
or
not
this
man
is
--
is
qualified
to
give
an
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
one.
the
next
thing
is
does
this
opinion
make
any
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
the
court
as
the
trier-of-fact
chooses
to.
that
the
--
not
reserved
to
cases
where
there's
a
jury?
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
that,
as
i
indicated
before,
that
the
whole
question
of
weight
and
admissibility
is
somewhat
less
important
when
the
trial
judge
is
not
the
gatekeeper.
the
trial
judge
at
the
end
of
the
day
can
hear
the
testimony,
say:
you
know,
i
admitted
this
testimony,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
it
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
does
what
i
said,
but
then
he
has
100
pages
of
findings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
think
that's
where
we
disagree.
the
judge
has
to
make
a
determination
that
in
his
view
the
class
can
be
certified.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
includes
some
factual
inquiries
as
to
the
damages
alleged
and
the
cause
of
the
injury
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
common
--
whether
or
not
there's
a
commonality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
not
--
i'll
think
about
it,
but
that's
not
my
understanding.
i
thought
the
judge
has
to
make
a
determination
that,
in
the
next
case
we
are
going
to
hear
this
morning,
that
the
representation
is
material,
or
it
affects
the
market.
the
judge
has
to
make
that
conclusion,
make
that
finding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course
there
matters
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
determine
at
the
merits
stage,
but
under
daubert
and
under
rule
702
the
judge
has
to
say
that
the
evidence
is
relevant
to
the
task
at
hand,
and
it
has
a
reliable
foundation.
i
can
see
a
judge
saying,
"well,
now,
this
theory
that
you're
using,
this
theory
works.
"
"i
think
it's
accepted
in
academia.
"
then
he
hears
all
the
testimony
and
he
says,
“
it
just
doesn't
work
here
”.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
what
i
just
described
is
not
daubert.
