mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
third
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
the
assessment
of
the
adequacy
of
expert
evidence
offered
in
support
of
class
certification
is
a
merits
question
that
has
no
place
in
the
class
certification
inquiry.
according
to
the
third
circuit
and
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
court,
what
is
sufficient
is
for
the
proponents
of
class
certification
to
point
to
some
abstract
methodology,
such
as
econometrics
or
regression
analysis,
that
conceivably
might
be
applied
to
the
problem
at
hand
in
a
way
in
which
in
the
fullness
of
time
will
evolve
into
admissible
evidence
by
the
time
of
the
class
trial.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
you
limited
my
argument
to
determination
of
damages,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
--
we
obviously
--
as
is
obvious
from
our
cert
petition,
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
for
purposes
of
inquiring
into
the
damages
question
in
this
court,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
that
is
so.
i
think
it
doesn't
change
the
outcome
with--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that
question,
justice
ginsburg:
one
about
what
the
legal
standards
are,
and,
you
know,
the
second
one,
which
is
as
important,
about
what
the
record
in
this
case
is.
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
what
the
rule
asks
us
to
look
at
is
not
questions
of
damages
versus
liability,
but
whether
the
common
questions
predominate
over
those
that
are
individual
to
the
class
members.
i
don't
disagree,
and
it
is
not
my
position
today,
that
there
may
be
cases
in
which
individual
damages
questions
are
consistent
with
class
certification.
but
as
the
lower
courts
have
recognized,
it
is
not
the
case
that
all
damages
questions
may
--
may
remain
individual
consistently
with
class
certification.
indeed,
the
1966
advisory
notes
expressly
say
that
questions
of
damages
with
respect
to
class
members
may
or
may
not
predominate
in
cases
like
this;
i.e.,
antitrust
class
actions.
let--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
kagan.
i
think
we
can
have
a
healthy
debate
about
whether
the
district
court
did
what
you
just
finished
saying.
i
think
there
can
be
no
debate
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
so,
because
repeatedly
throughout
its
opinion
said
that
the
questions
as
to
the
adequacy
of
whether
they
had
complied
with
the
hydrogen
peroxide
standard
was
a
merits
question
that
was
for
later
adjudication
in
this
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
think
that
it
is
true
that
our
position
in
the
district
court
was
that
hydrogen
peroxide
controlled,
and
that
the
district
court
correctly
stated
the
holding
of
the
third
circuit
ruling
in
that
case.
beyond
that,
i
don't
think
that
we
do
agree,
because
in
the
third
circuit,
once
the
case
got
there,
we
got
a
rule
of
law
saying
that
although
this
court
prescribed
the
rule
amendment,
23(f),
precisely
to
enable
courts
of
appeals
to
review
whether
the
district
court
got
it
right
for
important
policy
questions,
that
the
job
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
23(f)
can
be
fully
discharged
by
saying
that
providence
will
provide;
we'll
think
about
it
in
the
morning.
and
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
proposition
that
the
correct
law
was
applied
in
the
lower
courts.
furthermore,
although
the
district
court
did
enounce
the
correct
standard
in
reflecting
the
holding
of
hydrogen
peroxide,
it
is
far
from
apparent
--
and
this
is
part
of
our
point
to
the
third
circuit
--
excuse
me;
to
the
third
circuit
--
which
was
not
actually
heard
on
the
merits,
that
what
he
did
was
different
from
simply
saying
that
econometrics
and
regression
analysis
are
well
established
methodologies
for
dealing
with
problems
of
this
kind.
and
i
will
ask
you
to
look
at
the
top
of
page
145
of
the
pet.
app.,
where
you
can
look
at
discussions
--
i'm
sorry,
it's
131
in
footnote
24,
where
the
district
court
made
clear
that
his
understanding
of
the
capable
class-wide
proof
involved
the
inquiry
whether
the
plaintiffs
actually
had
evidence
that
reflected
the
methodologies
that
had
been
used
in
this
case
--
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
he
says,
"it
is
undisputed
that
multiple
regression
analysis
is
an
acceptable
and
widely
recognized
statistical
tool
for
cases
of
this
kind.
"
so
at
a
very
general
level,
i
don't
have
a
disagreement
with
you
that
in
many
cases
where
there
is
error,
the
district
court
started
out
with
the
right
foot.
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
the
correct
standard
either
was
applied
by
the
district
court
or
was
even
attempted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
if
we
were
to
go
to
the
merits
of
the
question
--
and
to
answer,
you
know,
the
second
part
of
the
question
that
i
started
out
with
justice
ginsburg,
keep
in
mind
that
even
on
the
assumption
that
the
district
court
accepted
that
there
was
common
class
proof
of
antitrust
impact,
that
is
not
the
same
as
accepting
--
and
i
don't
think
the
district
court
accepted
--
that
there
was
common
class-wide
proof
that
the
impact
for
every
individual
was
the
same.
and
that
is
a
key
point
about
what
the
theory
of
impact
here
was.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
and
i'm
happy
to
also
deal
with
that
question.
there
are
cases,
indeed,
in
which,
you
know,
the
variances
of
the
classes
can
be
dealt
with,
with
subclasses.
no
one
on
the
plaintiffs'
side
has
actually
asserted
here
that
the
record
would
allow
this.
and
mr.
jordan
pointed
out,
there
is
considerable
basis
for
skepticism
in
thinking
that
that
could
ever
be
accomplished
because
we
are
talking
about
649
franchise
areas
with
different
competitive
conditions.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
theory
of
impact,
and
the
theory
of
impact
was
that
rcn,
this
putative
overbuilder,
was,
you
know,
the
little
engine
that
could,
that
it
was
going
out
to
radiate
out
to
the
entire
dma
area
and
completely
overbuild
the
area.
so
the
theory
of
impact
was
if
you
drop
a
stone
in
the
water,
you
are
going
to
have
ripples
all
the
way
out,
so
you
have
ripples
as
to
every
member
of
the
class.
it
doesn't
mean
that
every
ripple
is
the
same.
so
--
so
that
the
key
question
for
the
damages
issue
in
front
of
you
now
is
whether
what
mcclave
came
up
with
was
an
adequate
methodology
for
measuring
the
size
of
the
ripple--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
i
think
the
text
of
(b)(20)
--
of
(b)(3)
expressly
requires
that
questions,
whether
they
be
damages
or
liability,
that
are
common
to
the
class
predominate
over
those
that
are
individual
as
to
class
members.
and
i
fully
accept,
and
i
am
not
arguing,
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
be
individual
damages
questions
precludes
class
certification.
i
am
actually
arguing
for
the
flip
side
of
that
issue,
which
is
that
just
because
it
--
it
may
not
be
preclusive
in
certain
cases
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
preclusive
in
no
case.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
by
judge
garwood
in
the
bell
v.
at&t
case,
which
was,
like
this,
an
antitrust
case,
where
the
fifth
circuit
acknowledged
that
in
many
of
these
cases
it's
almost
hornbook
law
that
there
may
be
individual
issues
that
would
not
preclude
class
cert,
but
that
there
are
certain
cases
in
which
the
theory
of
injury
and
--
and
the
proof
that
would
be
needed
to
make
it
out
is
so
sui
generous
and
individualized--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--right.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
mean,
the
answer
is
--
i
will
take
your
first
example
and,
in
fact,
i
was
going
to
give,
you
know,
the
example
of
a
case
that
i
had
that
was
similar
where,
you
know,
three
plastic
cup
manufacturers
met
in,
you
know,
some
airport
and
fixed
the
prices.
now,
this
is
like
saying
you
fixing,
you
know,
the
price
of
widgets.
there
is
a
preexisting
but-for
world
and
the
question
as
to
who
bought
what
when
is
not
really
a
question
of
adjudication
but
of
computation.
and
those
are
the
types
of
cases
where
the
courts
say
that
the
individual
damages
questions
really
do
not
preclude
a
--
a
certification.
now,
your
second
example
may
or
may
not
be
suitable
for
class
treatment.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
but
the
question--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--but
the
legal--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
but
it
isn't,
because
one
key
point
that
is
missing
from
the
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
is
exactly
what
the
theory
of
liability
that
is
present
in
this
case
is
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court.
they
had
four
theories
of
possible--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no.
i
mean,
i
think,
you
know,
the
key
point
that
you
are
missing
in
your
hypothetical--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--basically
starts
with
the
actual
point
of
antitrust
law,
whether
these
people
actually
are
potential
competitors.
it's
not
actually
relevant
to
the
class
certifications
that
we
face
today.
but
i
don't
accept,
for
present
purposes
or
for
later,
that
these
people
that
already
have
different
clusters
of
cable
service
that
were
simply
aggregated
in
these
transactions
actually
were
actual
potential
competitors.
they
were
not--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
you
are
right--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
just
said
that.
but
the
point
is
that
as
the
case
comes
to
the
--
to
the
court
the
question
is
whether
the
class
that
was
certified
by
the
district
court
and
validated
in
its
own
way
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
one
that
is
consistent
and
fits
reliably
with
the
legal
theory
that
the
plaintiffs
are
allowed
to
pursue--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--in
this
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
mean,
i
hate--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
breyer--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
mean,
i
really
hate
to
be
so
prosaic
and
you
mentioned
something
--
something
so
contrary
to
the
facts,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
fundamental
question
here
is
that
there
is
one
theory
they
are
permitted
to
pursue.
it
is
that
this
overbuilder,
rcn,
would
have
radiator
--
radiated
out
through
the
dma
area.
now,
you
may
think
that
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
pursue
some
other
different
theory.
it's
not
the
case
that
you
have
in
front
of
you.
and
the
fact
is
that
--
that
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
the
theory
that
remains
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
rcn
was
going
to
be
the
overbuilder
that
--
that
was
going
to
impact
prices.
two--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--if
i
could
just
finish.
two
things
follow
from
that.
you
know,
the
first
one
which
is
directly
pertinent
to
the
issue
here
is
that
the
mcclave
model
purported
to
compute
damages
that
were
not
limited
to
overbuilding,
and
that
in
fact
expressly
measured
overbuilding
only
as
to
5
out
of
the
16
counties.
the
damage
model
just
does
not
fit
the
legal
theory
that
stays
in
the
case.
the
second
aspect
of
it
is
that
as
a
question
of
the
factual
fit
with
the
record
in
the
case,
the
transactions
that
added
the
largest
number
of
subscribers
here
occurred
in
2000
and
very
early
2001.
the
record
in
this
case
includes
public
announcements
by
rcn,
repeated
by
the
fcc
in
its
competition
review,
that
they
were
not
going
to
franchise
any
new
franchises.
so
there
is
a
basic
question
of
lack
of
fit
between
the
ipse
dixit
of
the
expert
and,
you
know,
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
we
waived.
and,
you
know,
we
covered
this
in,
i
think,
3
or
4
pages
in
the
reply
brief
with
all
of
the
citations
as
to
how
we
challenged
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
that
is
not
right,
justice
ginsburg.
daubert
and
its
progeny
really
encompasses
three
distinct
prongs.
one
of
them
is,
of
course,
the
qualifications
of
the
expert.
the
second
one
is
the
--
the
reliability
of
the
methodology;
and
the
third
is
fit.
and
all
we
said
at
the
--
at
the
class
hearing
is
that
we
had
no
objection
to
the
proposition
that
these
people
have
ph.d.
's,
which
indeed
they
do.
but
the
issue
still
was
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
one
that
we
urged
that
the
methodology
was
not
relevant
and
did
not--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
but
i
think
we
--
we
agree
that
he
needed
to
conduct
more
than
a
daubert
hearing
because
we
agree
with
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
american
honda
that
the
question
at
the
class
cert
hearing
is
not
solely
one
of
whether
the
evidence
would
be
admissible,
but
also
one
of
--
of
whether
the
district
judge
himself
is
persuaded
that
this
is
class-wide
proof
that
has
not
been
impeached
in
his
own
mind.
and
so,
you
know,
the
mere
fact
that
we
all
understood
that
what
should
have
been
ruled
on
at
the
class
cert
hearing
encompassed
more
than
pure
daubert
admissibility
is
actually
part
of
our
complaint
here.
i
mean,
i
think
if
you
read
what
the
district
court
did,
he
basically
looked
at
his
job
as
looking
at
whether
the
model
was
capable,
as
in
literally
capable,
of
--
of
--
of
establishing,
you
know,
the
facts
that
the
plaintiffs
say
it
establishes
without
really
weighing
in
his
own
mind
whether
it
had
been
shown
to
be
fit
and,
you
know,
reliable.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
but,
justice
kagan--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--but,
justice
kagan,
i
mean,
i
think
we
could
go
through
chapter
and
verse
to
everything
that
we
put
in
the
reply
brief.
but
i
think
in
fairness
i
have
to
point
out
to
you
that
we
never
said
that
our
objection
was
to
the
weight
and
not
to
the
admissibility.
we
agree
that
these
people
have
properly
scholarly
credentials,
and
after
that,
as
we
say
in
the
reply
brief
with
citations
to
the
record,
we
said:
this
model
is
so
unreliable
that
it
is
just
not
usable
period,
full
stop.
we
went
to
the
third
circuit
and
said:
this
is
not
evidence
of
any
kind,
much
less--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
we
did
not,
and
we
actually
don't
think
that
that's
needed,
because
it
would
actually
be
sort
of
silly
to
engage
in
a
motion
to
strike
the
evidence
that
we
are
asking
the
district
judge
to
consider
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
actually
is
reliable.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't
think
that's
fair,
because
i
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
cited
daubert
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
did
say
to
the
district
court
that
the
model
was
not
usable.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
think
that's
fair.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
there
are
two
things
that
the
district
court
has
to
do
and
both
involve
an
assessment
of
the
validity
or,
as
you
would
put
it,
probity
of
the
expert
evidence.
you
know,
the
first
one
keeps
in
mind
that
the
focus
of
the
class
certification
hearing
is
to
decide
whether
the
--
this
case
should
be
tried
as
a
class,
and
therefore
the
first
question
that
the
district
court
has
to
ask
is,
even
if
i
think
that
this
is
not
ready
now,
do
they
have
a
methodology
that
sufficiently
fits
the
facts
and
is
reliably
based
on
a
scientific
method
so
that
these
people
will
be
capable
of
proving
class-wide
this
issue
at
trial.
that's
not
enough.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
was
--
i
was
going
to
point
out
by
reference
to
one
of
your
opinions,
justice
scalia,
that
there
is
a
question
sort
of
based
on
the
williams
case,
504
u.s.,
as
to,
you
know,
the
extent
to
which
these
issues
are
open
to
the
respondent
to
challenge
as
well.
because
by
the
time
we
framed
the
cert
petition,
even
though
we
framed
it
in
terms
of
daubert,
it
was
abundantly
clear,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief,
that
we
were
challenging
the
fit
and
the
reliability
of
the
methodology,
and
there
was
nary
a
word
in
the
--
in
the
brief
in
opposition
that
actually
took
issue
with
that.
on
the
face
of
that,
you
reformulated
the
question.
your
ruling
in
williams
would
say
that
that
issue
is
now
over
and
that
we
move
to
the
consideration
of
the
merits,
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
--
let
me
start
with
the
proposition
which
i
continue
to
find
startling,
that
a
damages
model
can
stand
up
to
examination
on
the
theory
that
it
is
not
linked
to
any
theory
of
anticompetitive
conduct.
now,
the
theory
seems
to
be
that
whether
the
mcclave
model
is
intended
to
do
is
to
isolate
competitive
markets
elsewhere
that
are
competitive
in
some
sense,
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
philadelphia
dma
is
somehow
less
competitive,
and
charge
whatever
the
expert
says
is
the
difference
to
comcast.
but
that
has
a
fundamental
failure
as
a
matter
of
substantive
antitrust
law,
because
we
know
from
cases
from
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
going
back
to
story
parchment,
that
the
one
requirement
is
that
causation
link
of
the
damages,
you
know,
it
has
to
be
certainly
linked
to
illegal
conduct.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
i
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--story
parchment.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
no.
i
think
all
you
have
to
do
is
whether
the
proponent
--
is
to
ask
whether
the
proponent
of
class
certification
has
discharged
his
duty
under
this
court's
cases
to
come
forward
with
evidence
that
is
persuasive
under
the
point
whether
the
case
as
a
whole
can
be
tried
as
a
class.
you
don't
have
to
become
an
econometrician;
you
have
to
know
enough
to
assess
whether
the
record
that
has
been
proffered
is
probative
on
the
question
before
the
court.
here,
it
isn't.
and
one
of
the
reasons
it
isn't
is
because
they
came
to
the
hearing
in
class
certification
in
the
fall
of
2009
after
full
merits
discovery.
the
papers
--
we
said
to
them,
"we
have
full
merits
discovery;
this
model
does
not
work.
"
we
had
variants
of
not
usable.
every
word
--
i
can
read
it
all,
justice
kagan,
if
it's
worth
taking
the
time.
you
know,
the
flaws
preclude
its
use,
it's
not
to
be
accepted,
it's
not
usable,
does
not
result
in
a
valid
methodology
that
can
be
used.
and
so
having
said
all
of
that,
we
said,
"this
model
is
bunk.
"
"you
have
full
class
merits
discovery.
"
"you
have
plenty
of
opportunity
to
come
up
with
a
better
model.
"
nothing.
we
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
affirmed.
then
it
goes
back
to
the
--
to
the
district
court
for
further
trial
proceedings.
the
district
court,
having
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
invites
them
to
submit
the
evolutionary
model
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
mind.
we
are
still
sticking
with
our
story:
mcclave's
the
guy.
and
so
they
have
had
every
conceivable
opportunity
to
develop
a
model.
why
haven't
they
done
that,
justice
breyer?
oh.
maybe
because
there
is
a
problem
in
the
record.
you
can
take
all
of
the
maps
in
the
record,
which
are
part
of
the
field
supplemental
appendix,
and
you
can
see
the
different
areas
of
penetration
for
dbs,
you
know,
has
different
rates
of
penetration
all
over
the
class
area.
same
thing
for
rcn
and
fios.
and
you
can
look
at
what
--
what
the
market
penetration
is
in
each
franchise
area.
consider
that
each
of
them
is
a
different
licensing
authority,
that
the
overbuilding
would
have
to
go
to
franchise
by
franchise
and
radiate
out
in
the
fullness
of
time.
and
i
don't
know
if
there
is
any
kind
of
attrition
that
can
combine
all
of
that
into
a
single
class
or
subclasses.
they
haven't
identified
one.
and
the
key
point
for
the
resolution
of
the
case
in
front
of
you,
justice
kagan,
is
that
the
question
that
comes
here
is
whether
a
class
that
is
more
expansive
than
the
one
that
you
--
that
you
certified
in
walmart
can
possibly
be
certified
where
there
is
no
evidence
that
is
tied
to
the
record
in
the
case
that
is
reliably
probative
that
a
class
would
exist.
