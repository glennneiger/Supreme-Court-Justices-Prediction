justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
estrada,
you
are
limiting
your
argument
to
the
determination
of
damages,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
--
because
the
third
circuit
agreed
that
as
far
as
any
antitrust
impact--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
could
be
established
on
a
class
basis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
--
why
not?
because
generally
--
at
least
it's
my
impression
--
that
in
class
certifications,
if
the
liability
question
can
be
adjudicated
on
a
class
basis,
then
the
damages
question
may
be
adjudicated
individually.
take
a
--
take
a
title
vii
case.
a
liability
--
pattern
of
practice
of
discrimination,
therefore
liability.
but
damages
can
be
assessed
on
an
individual
basis,
so
why
isn't
bifurcation
possible
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
same
for
every
member
of
the
class.
as
the
dissenting
judge
pointed
out,
you
can
have
subclasses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
challenged
the
probity,
mr.
estrada.
you
said
comcast
said
it
had
no
objection
to
mcclave's
qualification
as
an
expert.
so
what
you
were
talking
about
was
the
probity
of
this
report,
not
the
admissibility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
barnett,
this
is
on
a
different
issue,
but
you
had
originally
suggested
that
you
had
--
that
the
motion
--
that
the
settlement
that's
looming
was
a
reason
that
this
court
ought
not
to
decide
this
case.
but
do
you
now
agree
that,
given
the
district
court's
denial
of
your
motion
to
enforce
the
settlement,
that
the
proposed
settlement
has
no
bearing
on
this
court's
consideration
of
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
you
have
just
heard,
justice
breyer
and
i
joined
by
justices
sotomayor
and
kagan
think
this
case
is
not
fit
for
the
court's
review.
we
would
dismiss
the
writ
as
in
providently
granted.
we
dissent
on
grounds
both
procedural
and
substantive.
i
will
note
the
procedural
slips,
justice
breyer,
the
substantive
fault.
first,
the
court
wrote
its
own
question
presented.
comcast
question
concerned
rule
23's
prerequisites
for
cross-action
certification.
the
revised
question
instead
of
focusing
on
rule
23
as
whether
the
plaintiff's
class
had
introduced
admissible
evidence
including
expert
testimony
showing
the
damages
could
be
proved
on
a
class-wide
basis.
in
fact,
comcast
raised
no
objection
to
the
admission
of
the
damages
model
designed
by
plaintiff's
expert,
so
no
question
of
admissibility
was
preserved.
realizing
that
the
question
it
framed
was
in
inept,
the
court
addressed
a
different
question.
“did
plaintiff
fail
to
show
the
damages
could
be
awarded
on
a
class-wide
basis?”
the
court
settled
on
that
question,
however,
after
briefing
an
argument
ended.
understandably,
plaintiffs
followed
the
court's
instruction
and
trained
their
written
and
oral
arguments
on
admissibility,
not
rule
23
requirements.
thus,
the
plaintiffs
had
no
unclouded
opportunity
to
be
brief
and
argue
with
precision
the
issue
the
court
decides
against
them
today
and
that's
not
rigid.
second,
the
court's
ruling
is
good
for
this
day
in
case
only
for
it
depends
on
an
oddity,
the
plaintiff's
failure
to
oppose
the
need
to
prove
damages
on
a
class-wide
basis
through
a
common
methodology.
in
the
mine
run
of
cases,
class-certification
under
rule
23
(b)(3)
is
proper
when
liability
questions
come
into
the
class
predominate
even
if
damages
are
not
provable
in
the
aggregate.
that
is
black
letter
law
and
nothing
in
the
court's
opinion
today
disturbs
the
legions
of
federal
court
decisions
that
have
treated
liability
on
the
class
basis,
damages
in
smaller
units
or
individually.
