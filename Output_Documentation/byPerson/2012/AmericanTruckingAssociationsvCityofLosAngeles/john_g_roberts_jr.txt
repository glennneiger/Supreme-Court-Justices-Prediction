chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-798,
american
trucking
associations
v.
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
lerman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
matters
--
that
matters
in
your
view
whether
it's
a
key
component
of
commerce
or
not.
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
particular
highway,
a
particular
street,
you
think
castle
doesn't
apply
in
that
case?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
have
to
get
into
it
since
i
asked
you
a
question
about
it.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
they
say
there's
this
particular
road,
through
a
state
park
or
something,
that's
scenic,
and
sometimes
the
trucks
drive
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
it
causes
damage
to
what
the
state's
trying
to
preserve,
and
they
have
a
rule:
look,
if
you
do
that
three
times
and
we
warn
you,
the
fourth
time
you
can't
use
this
road.
that
is
preempted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
is
another
road
not
too
far
away.
you've
got
to
use
that
one.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bash,
welcome.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
true.
i
mean,
a
commercial
enterprise
might
want
to
attract
customers
because
of
its
reputation
as
a
--
as
a
green
company,
because
of
its
reputation
of
hiring
local
workers.
i
think
you
have
too
confined
a
notion
of
what's
good
business.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
rosenthal?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
like
a
lot
of
criminal
penalties,
that's
the
whole
point.
they
keep
people
from
doing
crimes.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
very
probative
to
say
we've
never
had
to
throw
anybody
in
jail
or
we
never
had
to
prosecute
anybody
criminally.
they
have
a
coercive
effect
that
a
private
operator
cannot
avail
itself
of.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
and
i've
heard
of
facial
attacks
to
criminal
statutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
lerman,
you
have
4
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kagan
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-798,
american
trucking
associations
versus
the
city
of
los
angeles.
