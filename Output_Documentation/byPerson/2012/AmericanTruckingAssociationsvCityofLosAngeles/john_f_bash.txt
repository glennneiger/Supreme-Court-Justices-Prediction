mr.
john
f.
bash
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--well,
if
the
city
were
to
pass
that
regulation,
they'd
have
to
make
out
a
record
that
it
either
--
it
comes
within
one
--
one
of
the
exceptions.
now,
it
could
have
been
the
safety
exception.
the
port
argued
for
that
here
and
the
district
court
rejected
it
on
the
record
after
hearing
testimony
about
the
alleged
safety
and
hazardous
cargo
justifications.
they
didn't
make
an
argument
under
sizes
and
weights.
presumably,
they
could
make
that
record.
you'd
have
to
see
about
the
strength
of
their
justifications.
i'd
note
that
i
--
it
would
probably
be
the
case
they
would
have
to
apply
uniformly
to
trucks
of
a
given
size
or
weights.
here,
they
were
only
going
after
drayage
trucks,
which
are
a
particular
category
of
trucks.
i
don't
know
if
they
could
make
that
showing
with
respect
to
all
trucks
or
if
that
was
their
intent
here.
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
could,
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
about
the
criminal
penalties
in
this
case.
we
accept
the
port's
statement
in
their
brief
on
face
value
that
the
criminal
penalties
would
only
fall
on
the
marine
terminal
operators.
but,
like
petitioner,
we
don't
think
that
makes
a
difference.
if,
for
example,
the
state
highway
commission
said,
okay,
certain
trucks
can't
use
our
roads
unless
you
sign
a
certain
agreement,
but
don't
worry,
if
you
don't
agree
to
abide
by
that
agreement
we
won't
do
anything
to
you,
but
we
will
throw
every
person
who
does
business
with
you
in
jail.
whatever
else
you
could
say
about
that
scheme,
i
think
it
would
be
pretty
clear
that
it
would
be
the
act
of
a
sovereign
and
so
it
would
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute.
mr.
john
f.
bash
yes.
we
think
not
only
is
there
enough
here,
but
there's
another
sort
of
a
bright-line
rationale
before
you
get
into
the
boston
harbor
sort
of
understanding
of
if
this
is
regulatory
or
market
participant.
and
that's
the
second
factor
we
cite
in
our
brief,
which
is
we
don't
consider
the
port
the
equivalent
of
the
cement
factory
in
reeves,
like
a
commercial
enterprise
that
you
might
see
in
the
private
marketplace.
this
port
authority,
like
i
think
virtually
all
other
port
authorities
in
charge
of
these
massive
container
ports,
hold
land
much
like
a
highway
commission
in
trust
for
the
public.
this
is
not
private
property
ownership.
if
you
look
at
all
the
different
metrics
of
success
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
to
and
the
district
court
pointed
to
and
i
think
the
port
points
to
in
their
brief,
they
are
not
bottom
line
business
metrics
like
shareholder
value
and
dividends
and
so
forth.
it's
economic
vitality
of
the
region.
it's
the
number
of
jobs
it
brought
to
the
l.a.
area.
that
is
not
the
mark
of
a
commercial
enterprise.
it's
the
mark
of
a
regulatory
body.
it's
something
a
mayoral
candidate
might
point
to.
mr.
john
f.
bash
i
think
it's
true
that
wal-mart
might
say:
hey,
we
don't
do
business
with
labor
law
violators,
or
we
adhere
to
certain
environmental
practices,
as
part
of
a
marketing
campaign.
but
i
think
what
this
court
said
in
boston
harbor
was
that,
yeah,
a
private
business
could
boycott
labor
law
--
law
violators
too,
and,
in
a
sense,
the
private
business
would
be
engaged
in
quote-unquote
regulation.
but
when
the
government
does
that,
when
the
government
uses
its
special
place
in
society
and
its
enormous
economic
power
to
effectively
leverage
its
power
to
impose
regulation,
that's
--
that's
fundamentally
different,
and
that
is
not
the
government
acting
in
a
market
capacity
even
though,
sure,
wal-mart
or
starbucks
could
do
a
similar
thing.
mr.
john
f.
bash
justice
kennedy,
that
--
that's
like
our
third
order
argument.
i
mean,
our
first
order
argument
is
criminal
penalties
and
just
the
nature
of
a
port
and
--
the
port
doesn't
contract
with
the
city.
the
port
is
a
department
of
the
city,
and
its
members
are
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
its
revisions
to
the
tariff
are
codified
in
city
ordinances.
so
it's
in
every
way
a
part
of
the
city,
it's
not
just
a
contractual
relationship.
we
think
just
the
criminal
penalties
here
and
the
nature
of
what
a
port
is.
a
port
--
a
regulatory
body
that
governs
a
critical
part
of
public
infrastructure
is
enough
to
resolve
this
case.
if
you
think
no,
the
criminal
penalties
don't
matter
and
this
port
is
more
like
the
cement
factory
in
reeves,
it's
really
just
a
plain
vanilla
commercial
enterprise,
we
do
think
the
fact
that
it's
leveraging
significant
economic
power,
that
it's
the
only
place
in
l.a.
to
do
this
business,
is
part
of
this
sort
of
gould
market
participant
analysis.
mr.
john
f.
bash
we're
--
we're
not
saying
it
has
no
recourse.
and
i
just
note
parenthetically
that
the
same
could
be
true
of
any
state
highway
commission
that's
contemplating
an
expansion
of
a
highway
project.
they
could
face
similar
suits
based
on
environmental
complaints.
they
could
face
similar
community
opposition:
we
don't
want
these
huge
trucks
coming
through
our
neighborhood.
that
doesn't
make
the
decrees
and
acts
of
a
highway
commission,
particularly
if
backed
by
criminal
penalties,
acts
that
lack
enforcement.
mr.
john
f.
bash
to
--
to
deal
with
that
sort
of
effectively
political
opposition,
community
opposition,
i
think
the
port
retains
a
lot
of
flexibility
under
the
statute
to
address
them.
if
you
look
at
page
90
through
93
of
the
pet.
app,
it
discusses
the
extensive
incentive
programs
that
the
port
established.
35
percent
of
the
drayage
trucks
currently
serving
the
port,
or
at
least
at
the
time
the
district
court's
opinion
was
written,
are
new,
clean
trucks
that
don't
have
the
same
emissions
problem.
mr.
john
f.
bash
i
took
justice
ginsburg's
question
to
be
addressing
a
slightly
different
point.
the
exceptions
are
for
things
like
safety,
hazardous
cargo--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--there
--
there
may
be.
it's
obviously
an
issue
that
hasn't
been
briefed
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
bash
but
i
--
i
just
wanted
to
emphasize
for
justice
ginsburg,
though,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
ports
and
other
--
other
municipal
entities
can
do
to
address
environmental
concerns.
and
they've
been
done
in
this
case.
it
is
the
replacement
of
these
trucks,
which
was
done
through
a
subsidy
and
incentive
program
that's
remarkably
similar
to
the
one
this
court
blessed
as
market
participation
in
hughes
that
allowed
these
extensive
emission
reductions
that
the
port's
seen.
that
sort
of
direct
participation
in
the
market
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
what
we
don't
have
here.
it's
not
enforced
through
criminal
penalties.
it's
not
the
--
the
port
acting
as
a
regulator
of
this
public
infrastructure.
it's
actually
entering
the
drayage
market
and
purchasing
trucks,
effectively
becoming
a
part
owner
of
the
truck.
so
i
do
think
that
the
port
has
extensive
authority
to
address
environmental
concerns
within
the
confines
of
this
preemption
statute.
the
chief
justice
asked
about
the
castle
question,
whether
it
matters
or
what
if
you
just
didn't
want
a
road
or
what's
the
size
of
it?
i
will
say
that
the
court
in
castle
seemed
to
think
it
made
a
difference,
the
sort
of
size
of
the
imposition,
but
i
don't
think
it
needs
to
make
a
difference
anymore
because
we
have
a
direct
preemption
statute.
we
think
that
the
logic
of
castle
applies
not
only
in
the
context
of
the
licensing
scheme
that
has
changed
but
was
effectively
in
place
during
castle,
but
under
section
14501(c)
itself.
14501(c)
says
states
can't
pass
regulations
that
relate
to
prices,
routes,
and
services,
but
it
also
gives
states
safety
exceptions
and
so
forth.
and
there
needs
to
be
a
reconciliation
of
those
two
provisions.
i
think
we'd
all
agree
that
if
a
state
--
if
a
truck
committed
two
safety
infractions,
you
couldn't
say,
well,
now
we're
going
to
regulate
your
prices,
routes,
and
services
as
punishment
for
that
infraction.
this
--
the
framework
we've
set
forth
in
the
castle
portion
of
our
brief
i
think
is
a
reasonable
reconciliation
of
the
state--
mr.
john
f.
bash
--no,
that's
certainly
not
okay.
we
think
that
fails
under
both
the
holding
of
castle
and
just
under
the
current
expansion
provision,
which
is
maybe
the
easier
way
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
bash
well,
it
should
be
clear
at
the
outset
that
we're
not
talking
about
people;
we're
talking
about
motor
carriers
as
an
ongoing
enterprise.
so
we're
not
saying
an
individual
can't
have
their
license
revoked.
are
you
finished
with
the
question?
mr.
john
f.
bash
but
more
broadly,
we
think
the
federal
regulatory
scheme
in
combination
with
this
preemption
provision
just
bars
states
from
taking
certain
actions
that
would
affect
the
interstate
operations
of
motor
carriers.
thank
you.
