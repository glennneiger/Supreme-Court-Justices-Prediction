mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
the
plain
text
of
the
faaaa
express
preemption
clause
and
the
continuing
vitality
of
this
court's
decision
in
castle
v.
hayes
freight
lines.
i'd
like
to
start
by
showing
why
the
port's
requirements
here
fall
within
the
text
of
the
statute
and
cannot
be
saved
by
any
market
participant
exception.
the
faaaa
provides
that
no
state
or
political
subdivision
of
a
state
may
enact
or
enforce
any
law,
regulation,
or
other
provision
having
the
force
and
effect
of
law
related
to
rates,
routes,
and
services
of
a
motor
carrier.
the
only
statutory
language
at
issue
here
is
the
force
and
effect
of
law
requirement.
and
the
port's
actions
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
under
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
phrase.
the
port
is
imposing
binding
standards
of
conduct
on
motor
carriers
as
a
condition
of
accessing
a
channel
of
interstate
commerce.
the
port
is
enforcing
those
requirements
through
criminal
penalties--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--they
--
they
did
make
that
representation
and
we
could
accept
that,
but
it's
irrelevant
because
the
port
is
still
imposing
the
criminal
penalties
on
the
terminal
operators.
and
when
a
state
is
imposing
criminal
penalties,
that
is
classic
governmental
action,
the
state
acting
in
its
sovereign
capacity,
regardless
of
whom
the
penalties
are
imposed
upon.
and
in
this
court's
decision
in
roe,
it
made
clear
that
states
could
regulate
trucking
activity
through
penalties,
in
that
case
civil
penalties,
imposed
only
on
people
who
do
business
with
truckers.
here,
the
state's
requirements
are
coming
at
the
truckers
from
both
ends.
on
the
one
end,
you
have
the
criminal
penalties
imposed
on
the
terminal
operators
to
coerce
their
conduct
and
exclude
truckers.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
tariff
which
puts
conditions
on
access
to
the
port
of
los
angeles,
which
is
a
key
channel
of
interstate
commerce.
so
the
port's
requirements
here
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
in
spades,
because
using--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--it's
--
it's
different
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
--
in
addition
to
the
overlay
that
14506
specifically
targets
identification
requirements,
and
--
and
for
purposes
of
this
case,
it's
--
but
i
understand--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--i
think
you
need
to
look
to
the
particulars
of
this
case,
and
the
--
and
the
fact
is
that
the
placard
requirement
here
is
codified
into
an
ordinance,
it's
backed
by
criminal
penalties,
and
it's
restricting
access
to
a
channel
of
commerce.
because
we
have
all
those
factors
here,
it
has
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
no.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
heavy
is
a
different
scenario,
justice
sotomayor,
because
there's
an
express
exception
to
the
faaaa
for
weight
and
size
restrictions.
so
congress
carved
out
a
series
of
exceptions
for
the
faaaa
for
safety
requirements,
which
gets
to
part
of
your
question,
for
height
and
weight
and
size
limits,
for
requirements
pertaining
to
the
transport
of
nonconsensual
goods
and
the
like.
it
did
not
create
a
proprietary
exception.
so
a
lot
of
your
honor's
concerns
may
well
be
covered
by
one
of
these
other
exceptions.
but
there
is
no
exception
for
a
proprietary
action.
if
it
has
the
force
and
effect
of
law
and
it
does
not
fall
within
one
of
the
enumerated
exceptions
to
the
statute,
then
it
is
preempted
under
the
terms
that
congress
used.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
the
ada.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
yes,
that's
quite
right,
and
precisely
because
that
statute
contained
an
exception
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
when
congress
enacted
the
faaaa,
it
copied
the
ada,
and
it
copied
the
express
preemption
clause,
but
it
--
congress
chose
not
to
include
that
proprietary
exception.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
i
don't
believe
the
record
--
the
legislative
history
doesn't
show
why.
but
congress
thought,
clearly
copied
the
statute
and
made
the
decision
not
to
include
it.
so
by
the
terms
of
the
statute,
congress
wrote
a
statute
that
preempts
any
action
with
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
and
it
chose
not
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
proprietary
action
which,
as
you
say,
your
honor,
was
included
in
the
airline
deregulation
act.
so
that
just
lends
added
force
to
the
argument
that
the
act
here
does
not
contain
an
unstated
exception,
an
exception
that
congress
has
created
not
only
for
the
ada,
which
is
the
express
model
for
this
act,
but
in
a
host
of
other
statutes
where
congress
carved
out
specific
exceptions
for
proprietary
actions.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
well,
boston
harbor
spoke
to
express
or
implied
indication
of
congressional
intent.
here
there
is
express
indication
of
congressional
intent,
which
is
an
express
preemption
provision
dictating
the
term
--
the
scope
of
preemption.
and
boston--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
it
was
implied
preemption.
there
was
no
express
preemption
clause
to
construe,
and
that
language
is
in
the
context
of
an
implied
preemption
case.
here,
as
justice
scalia
notes,
we
have
an
express
preemption
clause,
and
we
have
a
clause
that
has
carveouts
for
a
lot
of
things,
but
it
does
not
have
a
carveout
for
proprietary
action.
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
best
evidence
as
congress
has
intended.
this
court
has
stated,
when
there's
an
express
preemption
clause,
the
plain
language
of
the
clause
defines
the
scope
of
congress's
intent.
and
here
the
plain
meaning
of
the
clause
covers
actions
as
here
that
are
backed
by
criminal
penalties
and
impose
conditions
of
access
to
a
key
channel
of
interstate
commerce.
that
is
the
very
definition
of
force
and
effect
of
law.
the
port
is
invoking
the
full
coercive
power
of
the
state
to
impose
conditions
on
motor
carriers,
and
that
is
exactly
what
congress
sought
to
prevent.
congress
sought
to
prevent
state
actions
that
impede
the
free
flow
of
trade
or
that
would
result
in
a
patchwork
of
requirements
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction.
that
is
what
the
port's
doing
here.
it
--
it
conflicts
with
congress's
objectives
and
it
falls
within
the
text
of
the
statute.
and
it
cannot
be
saved
by
virtue
of
a
market
participant
exception
that,
by
respondent's
own
admission,
is
untethered
from
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
for
the
reasons
that
we've
discussed.
congress
made
quite
clear
what
it
wanted
to
except
from
the
broad
scope
of
preemption,
and
this
court
has
reinforced
the
breadth
of
preemption,
and
did
not
include--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--no.
if
this
has
the
force
and
effect--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--it
either
has
the
force
and
effect
of
law
or
it
doesn't.
if
it
has
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
it
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
express
preemption
clause
and
this
court
does
not
need
to
address
any
of
that.
i'd
like
to
turn
my--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--there
is.
thank
you--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--i
was
going
to,
but
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
i
was
going
to
get
to
the
second
question
in
the
case,
which
is
this
court's
decision
in
castle
v.
hayes
freight
lines.
in
castle,
this
court
held
that
--
that
a
state
cannot
enforce
otherwise
valid
requirements
through
a
partial
suspension
of
a
motor
carrier's
federally
granted
right
to
operate
in
interstate
commerce.
that
is
precisely
the
authority
that
the
port
is
claiming
here.
the
port
is
claiming
the
authority
to
suspend
or
revoke
motor
carrier's
access
to
the
port
of
los
angeles,
the
largest
container
port
in
the
united
states
and
a
key
channel
of
interstate
commerce.
that
would
affect--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
castle
spoke
to
partial
suspensions
of
a
motor
carrier's
right
to
operate
interstate
commerce
and
i
think
it
cannot
be
denied
that
in
this
case,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
port,
it
is
--
it
would
affect
a
partial
suspension.
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
get
into
single
roads
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--you're
quite
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
let
that
camel's
nose
under
the
tent.
if
it's
a
partial--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--that's
quite
correct.
it
would
affect
the
partial
suspension
of
interstate
commerce,
it
would
seriously
disrupt
their
interstate
commerce
operations.
this
falls
within
castle's
exact
terms.
and
congress
has
not--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--that
is--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--that
is
preempted
under
castle.
the
conventional
forms
of
punishment
might
include
the
three
times
and
we
fine
an
individual
truck.
but
that's
what
the
situation
was
in
castle.
you
can't
punish
a
violation
of
an
otherwise
valid
regulation
through
a
partial
suspension
of
interstate
commerce.
and
i
think
that
would
qualify.
and
castle
is--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--justice
kagan,
the
conventional
forms
of
punishment
include,
as
we
acknowledge,
taking
an
unsafe
truck
out
of
service
or
denying
access.
if
--
if
the
truck
is
leaking
hazardous
material,
the
port
can
deny
access
to
that
particular
truck.
the
key
--
the
key
problem
here
is
the
carrier-level
suspension
of
access.
and
so
saying,
because
that
one
truck
of
the
carrier
might
be
leaking
hazardous
material,
we
are
not
going
to
let
any
trucks,
even
perfectly
safe
trucks
that
don't
present
any
present
--
clear
and
present
safety
risk
--
into
the
port
until
you
fix
that
unsafe
truck.
and
that's
the
authority
reserved
by
the
state
in
this
case,
and
that
is
what
castle
said
is
preempted.
and
so
we
are
not
denying
the
authority
to
invoke
what
castle
called
conventional
forms
of
punishment,
which
we
would
concede
includes
the
--
the
type
of
punishment
your
honor's
contemplating,
but
what
it
doesn't
allow
is
a
--
a
suspension
of
access
to
a
motor
carrier
as
a
business
entity.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
because
that's
what
castle
dealt
with,
your
honor.
and
i
was
going
to
turn
to
the
statutory
scheme
in
castle,
which
is
castle's
decision
was
predicated
on
a
statutory
scheme
that
gave
the
federal
government
exclusive
authority
to
grant
interstate
commerce
permits--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--it
has
regulatory--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--i
don't
know
that
it
inspects
it
directly,
and
it
has
provisions
for
states
to
do
that.
but
the
federal
government
still
under
49
u.s.c.
13905
has
exclusive
authority
to
revoke
a
federal
--
a
motor
carrier's
federally
granted
operating
authority.
and
so
there
are
significant
rights
that
states
have
to
impose--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--i
don't
know
if
it's
ever
done
that,
but
what
it
has
done
is
--
is
what
castle
said,
which
is
--
is
--
there
was
no
reason
to
--
to
deny
that
the
conventional
forms
of
punishment
are
sufficient
to
protect
the
state's
safety
concerns,
and
then
if
they
are
not
sufficient
there
was
then
and
there
still
exists
a
remedy,
which
is
to
go
to
the
department
of
transportation
and
ask
them.
and
that
remedy
exists
to
this
day
under
49
u.s.c.
13905.
the
same
statutory
scheme
that
was
present
in
castle
and
animated
this
court's
decision
in
castle
is
present
today.
so
if
they
have
a
safety
concern,
there
are
ways
to
deal
with
it.
they
can
do
what
justice
kagan
suggested,
which
is
to
deny
access
to
a
particular
truck.
they
can
go
to
the
department
of
transportation
and
ask
for
--
for
some
type
of
action.
but
what
they
can't
do
is
assert
the
veto
power
that
this
court
held
was
precluded
in
castle
and
in
the
city
of
chicago
cases,
and
that
is
precisely
the
veto
power
that
they
are
asserting
here.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
i
think
that's--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--you're
right
that
it's
not
in
the
case,
your
honor.
it's
not
in
the
case
because
the
only
issue
here
was
whether
it
has
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
because
that's
what
the
court
below
held.
the
court
below
held
that
these
could
escape
preemption
because
the
port
was
acting
arguably
in
part
by
a
motivation
for
community
goodwill.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
i
don't
know
if
it
applies.
that
was
going
to
be
the
second
answer.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
i
don't
think
this
is
a
route
restriction.
i
don't
know
if
it
would
qualify,
and
that
would
be--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--not
only
are
we
arguing
a
different
question,
i
think
that
gets
to
--
and
i
would
like
to
answer
this
question
and
then
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
might.
but
that
gets
to
the
“
related
to
”
question:
is
that
in
fact
related
to
rates,
routes,
and
services
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property?
that
sometimes
is
a
more
factual
inquiry.
but
that
is
not
at
issue
here.
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
it
can
escape
preemption
because
the
port
was
arguably
motivated
in
part
by
a
proprietary
concern
such
as
community
goodwill.
none
of
those
words
are
in
the
statute,
which
preempts
all
actions
that
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
and
they
are
preempted
on
this
basis.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
justice
scalia,
the
criminal
penalties
are
not
a
red
herring.
rowe
makes
clear
that
you
can't
circumvent
the
act
by--
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
--i
know
you
didn't,
your
honor.
i
was
referring
to
mr.
rosenthal's
argument
that
--
in
response
to
a
question.
you
did
not
say
they
were
any
kind
of
herring
and
they're
not.
justice
breyer,
in
response
to
your
question:
rates,
routes
and
services
are
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
only
issue
is
whether
they
have
force
and
effect
of
law.
that's
the
only
issue
before
this
court.
the
court
below
said
they
lack
--
they
fell
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute
because
of
the
proprietary
nature.
mr.
rosenthal
talked
a
lot
about
the
commercial
motivations,
but
the
statute
doesn't
speak
to
commercial
motivations.
the
statute
speaks
to
actions
with
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
these
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law
and
are
preempted
on
that
ground.
mr.
rosenthal
said
castle
has
died.
castle
is
still
alive.
the
statutory
scheme
that
formed
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
castle
remain
to
this
day
in
title
49
of
the
u.s.
code,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
decision
then,
and
it's
the
basis
today.
justice
ginsburg,
the
concession
agreements
gives
the
port
unfettered
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
suspend
or
revoke
access.
in
this
court's
city
of
chicago
cases,
the
fact
that
the
city
claimed
at
least
some
power
to
deny
a
license
or
access
to
interstate
commerce
was
sufficient
and
it's
sufficient
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
n.
lerman
i
don't
agree
and
i
think
counsel
said
right
here
that
they
reserve
the
authority
to
suspend
access
for
past
or
ongoing
violations,
and
that
runs
afoul
of
castle
under
its
plain
terms.
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
