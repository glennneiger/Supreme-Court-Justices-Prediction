justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
--
even
though
a
related
statute
did
--
did
make
an
exception
for
proprietary
action,
isn't
that
right?
the
faaaa?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
ada.
justice
antonin
scalia
boston
harbor
was
implied
preemption,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
some
--
some
of
the
rules
are
okay,
though,
as
you
acknowledge,
and
i
guess
there's
a
second
question
in
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
were
about
to
get
into
that
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
you
should
stop
referring
to
a
key
component
of
interstate
commerce.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
key
or
not,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
the
federal
government
inspect
trucks
for
safety
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--leaking
hazardous
materials
and
such?
justice
antonin
scalia
has
it
ever
done
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
--
you
agree
with
that
--
that
that
provision
would
apply?
i
don't
see
that
it
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
route
restrictions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
there
is.
you
think
there
is?
he's
saying
that
you
can
answer
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
seems
to
me
the
answer
is
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
exception
do
you
appeal
to?
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
exception
are
you
appealing
to
from
the
--
from
the
preemption
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
different
point,
but
--
but
you're
--
you're
talking
about,
you
know,
an
exception
for
private
contract
operations
as
opposed
to
public
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
exceptions
to
the
preemption
and
that
is
not
one
of
them.
and
other
statutes
do
have
exceptions
for
--
for
commercial
operations
or
private
operations.
this
one
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
market
participants
impose
civil
and
criminal
penalties?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
how
we
decide
these
things?
when
there
is
on
the
books
a
criminal
penalty
that
can
apply
to
everybody,
do
we
let
the
state
come
in
and
say:
oh,
you
know,
no
harm,
no
foul
because
it's
on
the
books
but
we
--
we
don't
really
use
it.
well,
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
that
we
do
that.
if
it's
there,
it's
a
criminal
penalty,
and
if
--
if
the
condition
of
--
of
--
of
you're
being
able
to
impose
these
limitations
is
that
you
not
have
criminal
penalties,
there
is
a
criminal
penalty.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that's
crucial.
you
think
a
state
can
say
nobody's
going
to
come
on
our
highways
until
it
signs
a
contract?
okay?
these
highways
belong
to
us,
they
are
state
land,
and
anybody
who
wants
to
ride
on
the
highways,
you
have
to
enter
a
contract
with
the
state.
and
that's
going
to
get
around
this
federal
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
it's
a
highway
only
for
trucks.
it's
a
truck
highway.
okay?
it's
specially
reinforced
and
everything,
but
you
have
to
enter
a
contract
with
the
state
in
order
to
drive
your
truck
on
this
highway.
and
that's
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
we're
not.
that's
why
it's
a
hypothetical.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
the
state
makes
money
on
this
truck
highway.
it's
a
money-maker,
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
makes
it
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
implied
preemption
in
boston
harbor.
here
you
have
an
express
preemption
clause
which
contains
exceptions,
and
among
those
exceptions
is
not
the
running
of
a
commercial
enterprise,
even
though
that
is
made
an
exception
in
a
number
of
other
federal
statutes,
federal
preemption
statutes.
that's
a
very
high
hill
for
you
to
climb,
relying
solely
on
the
fact
that
you
are
a
commercial
enterprise.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
--
what
if
they
violate
those
conditions?
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
where
the
--
that's
where
the
shoe
pinches.
what
if
they
violate
those
contractual
conditions?
then
do
you
exclude
only
the
truck
that
violates
it,
or
do
you
exclude
the
whole
trucking
company?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
ultimate?
you've
tried
everything
else
and
you
whack
them
with
a
big
penalty.
what
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i've
never
heard
of
this
doctrine.
this
is
a
facial
attack
to
a
contract?
is
that
it?
i
mean,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
to
attack
this
contract
provision
by
provision,
or
application
by
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
say
they
were
a
red
herring.
