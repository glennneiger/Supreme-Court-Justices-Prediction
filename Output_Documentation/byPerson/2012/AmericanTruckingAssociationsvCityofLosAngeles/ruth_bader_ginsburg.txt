justice
ruth
bader

i
thought
that
the
port
said
we
don't
apply
criminal
penalties
which
come
from
the
tariff,
we
don't
apply
those
to
licensed
motor
carriers.
they
made
that
representation,
so
i
think
we
have
to
accept
that
as
being
so.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
why,
why
congress
had
a
different
regulation
for
ports
and
for
airfields?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
bash,
how
then
do
you
deal
with
the
problem
that
precipitated
all
of
this?
here
is
a
port
that's
getting
lots
of
complaints
from
the
neighborhood
people.
it
wants
to
expand
the
port,
it's
being
thwarted
by
environmental
suits,
so
it
wants
to
go
green
and
it
wants
to
do
something
about
the
pollution
and
the
traffic
and
the
hazards
from
the
truck.
you're
saying
that
it
can't
do
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
could
a
port
respond
to
the
complaints
if
you're
making
this
--
this
neighborhood
around
the
port
an
environmental
hazard?
and
so
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
our
representatives
vote
against
any
expansion
of
the
port.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
clarify
--
would
you
clarify
what
the
--
what
happens
when
there
is
an
infraction?
say
three
trucks.
is
it
right
that
you
can
suspend
until
the
infraction
is
cured,
that
you
can
suspend
all
of
that
operator's
trucks?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
do
the
other.
see,
i'm
--
what
--
what
are
--
is
it
--
is
it
just
a
matter
of
grace
that
you
will
say:
well,
we'll
require
them
to
fix
those
two
trucks
and
all
the
others
can
travel?
or
could
you
say:
until
you
fix
those
two
trucks,
none
of
your
trucks
come
through?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
say
it's
a
major
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
how
about
after
it's
corrected?
the
government
then
says
there's
some
uncertainty
about
that,
whether
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
there
--
there
was
a
representation
made
that
they
toe
the
line
that
the
government
draws.
that
it,
they
can
say:
"no
access
as
long
as
you
have
trucks
in
your
fleet
that
don't
comply.
"
"but
once
you've
gotten
your
fleet
in
order
and
you
are
in
compliance,
then
we
can't
punish
you
for
having
wrongs
in
the
past
by
saying
you're
--
you're
suspended.
"
that
--
that's
the
position
that
the
government
is
taking,
and
i
take
it
you
don't
agree
with
that.
