mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
today
are
two
provisions
contained
in
a
contract
between
commercial
actors.
they
set
forth
conditions
under
which
drayage
trucks
can
enter
the
nonpublic
portions
of
the
port,
and
they
are
indistinguishable,
indistinguishable
from
contract
provisions
that
private
parties
routinely
impose
on
those
who
seek
to
enter
their
property.
in
our
view,
the
faaaa
does
not
deal
with
contracts,
and
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
right
of
landowners
to
condition
those
seeking
entry
into
their
port.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
what--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--your
honor,
my
first
--
my
first
exception
is
the
actual
force
and
effect
of
law.
we
do
not
believe--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--we're--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--with
--
with
due
respect,
the
statute
says
"law,
regulation,
or
provision
having
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
"
that's
a
--
that's
something
which
applies
to
the
general
public.
we
submit
that
what
we
are
calling
the
market
participant
exception,
what
it
is
generally
congruent
with,
what
is
meant
by
congress
by
the
term
“
force
and
effect
of
law
”.
the
sixth
--
the
fifth
circuit
in
cardinal
said
that
the
market
participant
analysis
should
inform
what
is
meant
by
force
and
effect
of
law.
we're
not--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--ah.
i
think--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--the
answer
is
no,
but
i
think
the
criminal
penalties
is
a
red
herring
in
this
case,
and
if
you
will
--
if
you'll
just
indulge
me
a
moment,
the
concession
agreement
everyone
concedes
does
not
include
any
criminal
penalties.
the
tariff
which
applies
to
the
marine
terminal
operators,
yes,
it
contains
a
criminal
penalty,
but
the
criminal
penalty
is
not
included
in
this
tariff
against
the
marine
terminal
operators.
it's
intended
for
other
purposes.
we
have
no
recollection
of
a
cargo
operation
ever
having
had
a
criminal
penalty.
yes,
it's
in
there,
there
is
a
misdemeanor
penalty
but
it
applies
to
people
like
trespassers,
people
who
perform
traditional
criminal
acts.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record.
i
asked
the
director,
the
deputy
director
of
the
port,
how
do
you
enforce
these
requirements,
and
his
answer
was,
primarily
through
our
lease
contract.
obviously,
we
don't
want
to
do
away
with
the
--
with
our
lessor,
but
there
is
no
indication,
and
there
is
no
fact
on
the
record
that
these
criminal
penalties
which
our
opponents
keep
dredging
up
are
ever
used
against
mto's.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
justice
scalia,
first
of
all,
the
direct
criminal
penalty
doesn't
apply
to
the
truckers
at
all.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
so
the
argument
is,
this
is
an
indirect
effect,
and
what
i'm
trying
to
argue
is
the
indirect
effect
is
not
criminal
in
nature.
yes,
there
is
a
criminal
provision.
but
i'm
saying
as
a
practical
matter,
criminal
penalties
aren't
used
indirectly
to
enforce
this
prohibition.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
usually
criminal
penalties
apply
to
the
public.
the
reason
i'm
bringing
this
up
is
we
have
an
entirely
separate
and
much
more
robust
relationship
with
our
own
tenants
through
the
lease.
the
lease
is
the
way
this
is
enforced.
criminal
penalties
--
no
mto
thinks
for
a
second
about
the
criminal
penalty.
they
think
about
the
contractual
relationship.
and
that's
an
important
point
here
because
what
we're
talking
about
and
what's
central
here
is
the
management
of
land
which
we
own,
which
we
will
not,
underscore
“
not
”,
be
able
to
grow
and
develop
unless
we
have
some
modicum
of
control.
and
we
are
not
talking
about
expansive
control
here,
but
some
modicum
of
control
over
who
enters
our
land.
let
me
make
one
additional
point
which
i
think
is
terribly
important.
the
owner
of
land
--
the
owner
of
land
has
to
have
some
control
of
the
type
which
ata
and
the
government
says
we
can't
have
control
over.
i
will
give
you
a
simple
example
where
we
cut
a
hole
in
our
fence
and
say
the
trucks
can
come
in,
you
can
come
in
on
navy
way
but
you
can't
come
in
on
prospect
street.
that
under
a
strict
definition
of
the
statute
would
be
prohibited
to
us.
but
you
can't
prohibit
a
landowner
from
saying:
you've
got
to
identify
yourself.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
but
we're
not
acting--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--my
case
differs
because
we
are
not
dealing
directly
with
rates,
routes
or
services.
we
are
not
regulating.
we
are--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--no.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
that
question
was--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
the
--
the
answer
--
our
position
is
that
even
if
it
is
rates,
routes
and
services,
that
what
we
are
doing
is
not
regulation,
that
this
is
proprietary.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
i
think
--
i
think
--
it
differs
from
that
because
we're
not
prescribing
any
--
if
we
are
describing
--
if
we
are
prescribing
it,
it's
inherent
within
our
ability
to
access
our
particular
land.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
but,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
say
again,
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
that
attach
to
the
breach
of
the
contract.
it
is
purely
a
contract.
the
remedies
are
purely
civil.
even
our
other
side
in
their
argument
has
conceded
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
to
the
breach
of
the
concession
agreement.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no,
no,
no.
justice
scalia,
there
is
a
critical
distinction
here.
the
roads,
the
bridges,
the
parks
are
open
generally
to
the
public.
there
is
a
difference
between
that
and
the
private
part
of
the
city
hall.
for
example,
we
restrict
who
comes
into
the
garage
under
the
city
hall.
we
restrict
who
comes--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--but
we're
not
--
we're
not
dealing
with
that
hypothetical.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
but
there's
a
difference,
and
let
me
give
you
the
difference,
justice
scalia.
and
that
is
in
this
particular
case
we
are
dealing
with
a
business,
a
commercial
enterprise.
and
i
think
the
appropriate
standard
which
we
would
contend
controls
whether
force
and
effect
of
law,
market
participant
applies,
is
whether
this
was
an
action
taken,
reasonably
taken
to
deal
with
a
genuine
commercial
interest
of
the
port.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no,
no,
we're
not--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--no.
we
are
not
prepared
to
concede
that
making
money
is
sufficient,
taxes
are
sufficient.
we
have
findings
in
the
district
court
here
that
this
was
undertaken
to
advance
a
commercial
objective,
that
commercial
objective
being
to
allow
the
port
to
grow.
this
--
the
city
undertakes
regulatory
activities.
it
runs
a
police
department,
it
runs
--
it
runs
a
fire
department,
public
works.
it
does,
in
the
case
of
the
city
of
los
angeles,
run
three
enterprises:
a
port,
an
airport,
and
a
power
and
water
department.
that
is
substantively
different
than
running
the
public
roads
and
the
bridges.
and
we
believe
what's
critical
to
this
analysis
and
what
we
have
extensive
findings
from
the
district
court
is
that
this
was
run
as
a
business,
like
the
cement
plant,
like
the
boston
harbor.
boston
harbor
i
think
i
would
posit
is
far
closer
case,
it
seems
to
me
than
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
which
are
marine
terminals.
but
nonetheless,
in
boston
harbor
this
court
held
that
the
regulation
of
who
could
work
in
boston
harbor,
the
circumstances
fell
within
the
market
participant
doctrine.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
it's
not
the
only
thing,
justice
scalia,
i'm
relying
on.
i'm
also
relying
on
the
language
which
congress
put
in,
which
are
words
of
the
limitation,
which
is
force
and
effect
of
law.
if
congress
had
not
--
had
said
any
requirement
by
the
port,
any
requirement
by
a
city
whatsoever,
i
believe
we'd
have
a
closer
case.
but
they're
only
talking
about
things
which
have
application
to
the
general
public.
we
submit
that
force
and
effect
of
law
almost
invites
a
market
participant
analysis.
let
me
also
respond
to
your
point
about
the
ada,
the
airport
deregulation
act.
the
reason
there
is
a
limited
exception
for
airport
proprietors,
as
this
court
has
held,
is
because
there
was
a
longstanding
issue
about
airports
being
able
to
impose
restrictions
about
noise
pollution
on
surrounding
communities.
congress
was
well
aware
back
in
the
1970s,
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
of
that
controversy
and
they
wanted
to
preserve
of
the
existing
rights
of
airports.
there
is
no
comparable
controversy
with
respect
to
truck
ports
or
ports
or
the
government
that
was
ongoing
in
1994
when
this
particular
statute
was
adopted.
but
let
me
point
out
that
what
did
--
did
occur
in
1994
was
that
congress
was
writing
against
the
backdrop
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
boston
harbor
case,
in
which
congress
was
told
that
in
the
absence
of
something
express,
which
says
that
a
city
or
state
can't
manage
its
own
property
when
it
pursues
its
proprietary
interests,
that
there
would
not
be
inferred
--
not
be
inferred
--
a
restriction
on
a
state's
power
to
manage
its
own
property.
so,
unlike
the
situation
when
the
ada
was
adopted,
when
the
faaaa
was
adopted
in
1994,
there
was,
we
submit,
a
background
principle,
which
this
court
had
enunciated
earlier,
that
there
was
a
presumption
that
our
proprietary
powers
were
to
be
preserved.
if
--
if
i
can,
i'd
like
to
go
on
to
the
castle
argument
as
well.
our
point
--
we
make
three
different
points
in
castle.
first
of
all,
our
position
is
that
the
castle
decision
was
predicated
upon
a
very
specific
statutory
regime
that
existed
in
--
under
the
federal
motor
carrier
act
of
1935.
justice
black
specifically
noted
the
details
of
that
statutory
regime,
which
included
certificates
of
convenience
and
necessity,
very
precise
rules
under
which
trucks
were
to
operate
within
--
within
the
united
states.
that
regime
has
died.
died
several
decades
ago.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
castle
doctrine
as
it
existed
died
with
that
regime.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
in
fact,
we
don't
exclude
anybody
from
the
port.
we
simply
ask
that
those
trucks
that
come
on
to
port
property
sign
a
nonexclusive
concession
agreement
which
agrees
to
certain
conditions.
so
drayage
trucks
that
come
on,
on
a
regular
basis,
have
to
sign
these
conditions.
we
would
point
out
that
people
who
operate
at
our
port
intermittently
can
get
day
passes.
and
generally
speaking--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
we
--
we
--
there's
a
gradation
of
remedies.
we
don't
--
we
have
--
we
have
generally
not
excluded
or
revoked.
generally,
what
we've
done
is
tried
to
get
compliance.
there
are
--
there
are
penalties,
there
are
mechanisms
of
a
contractual
nature
which
are
used.
those
are
the
principal--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--in
--
in
cases
involving
fraud,
criminal
penalties
of
a
continuing
nature,
we
can
suspend
or
revoke
their
right
to
come
on
to
the
property.
that's
the
ultimate.
but
--
but
--
and
this
deals
with
the
castle
argument--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--again,
we
--
this
--
there
hasn't
been
this
experience
of
--
of
having
to
revoke
and
--
and
suspend
in
cases
like
what
you're
describing.
there
are
--
for
example,
there
has
been
revocations
when
an
lmc
has
not
had
the
insurance
it's
required,
but
that
applies
to
all
of
their
trucks.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
there
--
there
hasn't
been
the
experience.
what
we
said
before
is
that
the
severest
penalties
are
intended
for
severe
continuing
offenses.
and
our
position
is
that,
given
the
fact
that
there
are
reasonable
applications
of
the
revocation
--
of
the
suspension
requirement,
given
the
fact
that
ata
has
launched
a
facial
attack
on
our
regulation,
that
it
will
be
sufficient
time
to
deal
with
an
as-applied
castle.
if
castle
survives
and
this
court--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--yes.
let
me
--
let
me
give
you
--
let
me
give
you
my
--
the
three.
first,
we
don't
believe
castle
continues.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
second
--
second
argument
--
second
argument
is
that
even
under
the
castle
regime,
all
castle
talked
about
is
going
--
allowing
a
truck
to
go
up
to
a
customer's
property
line,
that
--
that
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
never
gave
anyone
permission
to
go
into
wal-mart
or
anything
else.
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
and
thirdly,
our
position
is
that
given
this
is
--
this
being
a
facial
attack,
given
the
fact
that
we
believe
that
there
are
lawful
applications
of
--
of
the
revocation
to
ongoing
continuing
violations,
which
is,
frankly,
the
only
--
i
can't
make
a
representation--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--well,
but
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
facial
attack
to
--
it
is.
it's
a
facial
attack
to
a
contract.
we
don't
believe
that
it
applies
to
our
contract
at
all.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
but
--
but
they're
arguing
that
our
contract
is
tantamount
to
a
law.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
right.
and
--
but
they
are
attacking
this
remedy
to
--
they've
--
they've
--
talking
--
they
are
attacking
this
on
--
on
its
face
and
saying
that
no
application
of
this
provision
is
--
is
an
exception.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
where
--
where
a
truck
is
in
continuing
violation,
a
company
is
in
continuing
violation
of
a
safety
restriction.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
because--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--let
me
--
let
me
try
to
respond,
justice
breyer.
i
think
if
one
reads
the
opinion
in
castle,
castle
dealt
with
a
past
violation,
not
a
continuing
violation.
the
record
in
that
case
didn't
deal
with
the
--
and
i
think
the
words
of
the
--
justice
black
said
that
would
be
a
different
case,
that
there
would
be
a
right
to
exclude
a
continuing
violation.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
you
certainly
may.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
if
--
if
it
does,
it
submits
an
off-street
parking
plan
for
all
of
the
trucks
which
are
registered
to
go
onto
the
property,
and
it
has
to
agree
to
keep
those
trucks
in
the
off-site
parking.
if
it
breaches
that
agreement,
it's
treated
as
a
breach,
and
we--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--that
--
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no,
it
does
not
have
to
be
permanently
affixed
to
the
truck.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
well,
there
were
--
we
--
we
provide
them
if
they
want
a
sticker
they
can
put
on
their
truck,
but
we
don't
require
it.
we
just
give
them
the
words.
and
most
trucks,
in
fact
virtually
all
trucks
of
this
type,
have
a
--
have
a
frame
on
the
outside
where
they
temporarily
put
plaques,
for
example,
at
times
when
they
are
carrying
hazardous
materials.
you
probably
have
seen
that
color
design
on
the
side.
those
are
temporarily
affixed.
so
if
a
trucking
company,
an
lmc,
wished
to
just
put
the
plaque
on
as
it's
crossing
the
gate
and
take
it
off
when
it's
leaving
the
gate,
it's
--
it's
fully
lawful
to
do
that
under
our
restrictions.
most
of
them
just
leave
--
leave
it
on,
but
that's
not
required.
the
plaque
is
only
required
as
it
enters,
while
it's
on
port
property,
and
when
it
leaves,
as
it
leaves.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
what?
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
there
are
--
there
are
--
there
are
members
of
the
public
include
also
the
people
who
are
on
--
at
the
mto,
also
other
truckers.
the
purpose
of
it
is
essentially
to
provide
a
--
a
remedy
to
notify
from
people
who
are
on
the
port,
and
--
and
also
to
act
essentially
as
a
notice
to
the
drivers
in
the
trucking
company
that
if
they
are
violating
the
rules,
there
--
people
know
there's
a
phone
number
they
can
call.
so
it
acts
--
it
has
a
certain
enforcement
effect.
my
point--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--we
--
we
are
--
there
has
been
very
little
practice,
justice
ginsburg,
under
that,
but
basically
our
enforcement
where
there
have
been
violations
has
been
to
ban
the
particular
truck
in
question,
not
the
entire
lmc.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
we
--
we
have
built
in
a
gradation.
i
mean,
it's
not
purely
a
matter
of
grace.
we
classify
things
as
minor
violations
and
major
violations.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
if
it
were
a
major
violation
involving
something
we
believe
was
systemic
within
the
lmc,
the
--
the
--
not
the
regulation,
but
the
concession
agreement
would
leave
the
possibility
that
we
could
revoke
or
suspend
until
the
problem
was
corrected.
but
--
but--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--we
have
--
we
have
never
enforced
it
that
way.
i
mean,
the
enforcement
--
we
haven't
used
revocation;
we
haven't
used
suspension.
and
generally
speaking,
our
intent
has
been,
as
we
stated
in
the
lower
court
and
as
we
stated
repeatedly,
to
use
this
for
continuing
violations.
but
we
are
really
talking
about
future
actions
because
revocation
and
suspension
have
not
been
common.
let
me
conclude
by
making
two
points
here.
number
one,
this
port
undertook
these
actions
as
a
reasonable
and
genuine
response
to
the
needs
to
build
and
grow
a
port.
if
we
are
prohibited
from
taking
what
are
substantively
limited
actions
to
control
trucking,
then
essentially
we're
going
to
be
in
a
posture
in
which
this
port
will
be
disabled
by
its
surrounding
community
from
doing
what
it
needs
to
do
to
compete.
secondly,
we
submit
you
cannot
be
the
owner-proprietor
of
property
without
having
some
control
over
the
conditions
under
which
owner
--
under
which
invitees,
business
invitees,
come
onto
your
property;
that
this
statute
of
congress
was
not
intended
to
constrain
that
property
interest.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
no.
i
disagree--
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
--justice
breyer.
it's
not
because
we're
--
we
have
support
as
the
proprietorship.
it's
because
these
actions
were
commercial
in
nature.
mr.
steven
s.
rosenthal
these
--
the
port
is
operating
as
an
enterprise
not
because
it
has
the
label
“
enterprise
”,
but
because
this
is
a
business
and
as
a
business
we
should
be
entitled
under
even-handedness
to
do
what
a
wal-mart
or
any
other
company
could
do
to
enable
us
to
prosper,
grow,
and
nurture
our
business
enterprise.
thank
you.
