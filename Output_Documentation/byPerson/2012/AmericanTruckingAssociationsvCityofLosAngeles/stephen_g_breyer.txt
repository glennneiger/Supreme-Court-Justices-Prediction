justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
make
a
somewhat
--
this
is
how
i'm
seeing
the
case
and
there
is
some
mystery
in
it
to
me
and
it
would
affect
how
i
might
write
this
thing
or
consider
it.
look,
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
not
have
trucks
park
in
the
neighborhood
on
the
street,
and
they
want
to
put
a
tag
on
it.
all
right.
so
the
second
--
you
seem
to
have
said
what
they
should
have
done:
you
go
to
the
ntsb
and
you
ask,
and
they
do
it.
they
approve
it
or
they
don't.
and
their
--
their
problem
is
that
they
don't
want
40
or
50
states
each
saying
a
different
sticker,
all
right?
so
then
the
whole
back
fills
up
with
stickers
and
that's
the
problem.
that's
the
problem.
you
go
explain,
et
cetera,
okay.
but
the
first
part,
the
parking,
it
seemed
to
me
of
course
they
should
be
able
to
do
that.
and
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
tailor-made
exception:
the
authority
of
the
state
to
impose
highway
route
controls
or
limitations.
and
if
that
isn't
tailor-made
for
this,
i
don't
know
what
is,
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
it's
doing
there.
and
so
why
has
nobody
done
that?
when
i
read
the
lower
court
on
that,
they
said:
oh,
it
affects
fares
and
it
affects
services.
every
route
restriction
affects
fares
and
services,
you
know?
so
here
i
see
an
exception
which
seems
tailor-made
for
what
they
want
to
do.
i
see
all
kinds
of
problems
with
the
proprietary
thing.
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
what
--
what
i
see
as
the
exception
tailor-made
for
this
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
do
you
suggest?
and
it's
a
question
for
both
sides.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you
can't
say,
don't
drive
our
truck
through
the
neighborhood?
this
is
residential
area,
no
trucks
over
such-and-such.
if
you
can
say
that,
why
can't
you
say
do
it
part
of
the
time?
why
can't
you
say
--
we're
arguing
a
different
question.
i
agree
it
is
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
wait.
why
isn't
the
--
i
mean,
i
thought
that
the
purpose
of
these
exceptions
--
of
course
cities
can
have
parking
regulations.
of
course
states
and
cities
can
have
regulations
involving
trucks
as
to
how
and
where
they
use
the
highways
and
which
ones
they
can't
use
and
which
routes,
et
cetera.
that's
the
purpose
of
that
exception,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
i
--
i
thought
that's
what
it
was.
and,
of
course,
you're
quite
right
in
saying
they
should
have
to
do
it
uniformly.
it
says
based
on
size
and
weight.
okay.
fine.
what's
the
problem
with
that,
that
i'm
not
seeing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it
says,
"the
authority
of
a
state
to
impose
highway
route
controls
or
limitations
based
on
the
size
and
weight
of
the
motor
vehicle
or
the
--
or
hazard
--
or
hazardous
nature.
"
and
it's
size
and
weight,
hazardous
nature.
i
mean,
isn't
there
room
in
those
words
to
include
environmental
consideration?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
myself
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
why
the
route
regulation
thing
is
the
exception.
but
the
state
of
california
decides--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--pardon
me.
i
know
you're
not.
the
state
of
california
decides:
here's
what
we
have:
a
state
public
utilities
commission
which
issues
a
tariff,
and
what
the
tariff
says
is
anyone
who
contracts
with
a
person
in
this
state,
a
property
owner,
to
move
his
goods
and
services,
cannot
charge
less
than
$30
a
pound.
all
right?
plainly
preempted.
and
your
case
differs
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
it
falls
outside
the
definition
of
“
routes
”.
well,
that
argument
is
not
in
front
of
us.
i
mean,
i
thought
we
were
conceding
here
it
falls
within
the
definition
of
routes
or
rates
or
services.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
parking
regulation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
if
it
doesn't
fall
within,
then
i'm
not
sure
what
we're
talking
about,
because
i
thought
the
problem
was
that
it
does
fall
within
the
rates,
routes
and
services,
and
then
the
question
is,
is
there
proprietary
exception,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
i
asked
you,
and
how
does
it
differ
from
the
hypothetical
i
just
put.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
three
reasons,
and
the
first
one,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
why
it
wouldn't
survive
in
a
policy
of
deregulation
if
it
seemed
to
apply
a
fortiori,
or
equally,
but
i
don't
want
to
argue
that
with
you.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
the
second
and
third.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
is
the
second
and
third?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what's
the
one
that
would
be?
give
me
the
example
that
you're
thinking
of
where,
given
castle--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
its
applications,
it
would
be--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
now,
how
does
--
how
--
how
would
that
differ
from
castle?
because
what
castle
was
concerned
about
was
a
state
that
has
a
perfectly
lawful
regulation,
and
it's
violated,
then
the
state
as
the
remedy
excludes
the
truck
from
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
it's
concerned
about.
and
it
didn't
say
anything
about
accepting
very
serious
violations,
i.e.,
continuing
ones.
the
reason
was
the
need
for
interstate
regulation
of
an
interstate
enterprise.
and
that
was
the
reasoning.
leave
it
to
the
icc,
a
fortiori,
where
it's
deregulatory
policy,
but
leave
that
to
the
side.
i
want
to
know
your
best
case
in
that
one,
and
i
don't
see
the
example
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
make
--
make
this
argument
precisely
and
substitute
for
“
port
authority
”
the
words
“
city
of
san
diego
”,
okay?
and
--
and
you'd
be
still
right.
i
mean,
what's
bothering
me
is,
i
--
i
don't
know
you've
got
the
right
one.
so
--
so
if
we
decide
in
your
way,
what
we've
done
is
distinguish
precisely
the
same
situation,
you
from
the
city
of
los
angeles,
simply
because
of
the
method
they
have
of
governmentally
regulating
the
port.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
see.
