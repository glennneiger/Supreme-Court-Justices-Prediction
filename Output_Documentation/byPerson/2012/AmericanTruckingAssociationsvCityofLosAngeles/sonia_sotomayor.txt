justice
sonia
sotomayor
can
i
break
down
your
arguments
into
two
components,
if
you
might?
whether
or
not
the
market
participant
exception
exists
at
all;
and
if
it
does,
how
far
does
it
go?
so,
let's
get
to
the
first
question
in
my
mind.
seems
almost
impossible
for
me
to
believe
that
the
states
couldn't
require
someone
to
put
a
little
placard
like
you
get
at
the
--
at
almost
any
building
that
you
go
into
to
park
your
car.
they
ask
you
to
put
a
little
placard
in
the
front
of
your
window
so
they
know
who
you
are
and
where
you're
going
in
the
port,
okay?
why
is
the
placard
requirement
here
any
different
than
that
requirement
generally?
because
if
you
enter
property,
you
have
--
most
people
tell
you
put
a
placard
in
the
window
to
tell
us
you
got
permission
to
come
in.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
even
if
that,
if
we
didn't
have
a
market
participant,
why
couldn't
the
state
say:
when
you
come
into
the
terminal,
you
just
got
to
put
a
little
placard
in
so
we
know
that
you're
not
parking
here
overnight
when
you've
already
been
unloaded
or
something
else?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
the
terminal
say,
we
have
a
pollution
problem
and
only
modern
trucks
can
come
and
unload
here?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
they
have
to
take
trucks
that
are
too
heavy
for
this
crane
to
lift?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
except
in
boston
harbor,
we
said
that
there
was
a
presumption
in
favor
of
it
unless
congress
explicitly
indicated
to
the
contrary.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
we
need
to
get
into
the
market
exception
if
we
find
that
this
is
--
has
the
force
or
effect
of
law
rather
than
being
a
private
contract?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
one
or
the
other
--
or
both,
but
we
could
choose.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
think
the
city
could
pass
a
regulation
like
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
that
says,
stay
off
residential
streets?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
--
do
you
think
that
a
statute
that
says
if
you're
trucking
company
operator
and
you
have
three
violations
of
x
safety
regulations,
you
just
can't
use
our
highways
because
we
don't
trust
you,
is
that
okay?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
why
isn't
it
a
standard
fact
that
states
and
cities
use
to
stop
people
from
repetitive
violations
to
tell
them,
if
you
keep
doing
this
and
don't
remedy
what
you've
done,
we're
just
not
going
to
let
you
do
x,
y,
and
z?
why
wouldn't
the
safety
violate--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
i
just
go
back,
because--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--the
theoretical
questions.
the
agreement
requires
the
operators
to
have
offsite
parking.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right?
it
has
to
do
that
for
a
reason.
it
means
that
if
its
trucks
don't
use
that
offsite
parking,
that
the
operator
is
in
default?
is
that
the
city's
position?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure.
what
you're
saying
is
if
trucks
park
anywhere
else,
then
the
operator's
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
with
respect
to
the
placard,
as
i
read
the
provision
it
says
you
have
to
have
the
placard
coming
in
and
going
out.
is
this
like
one
of
those
parking
placards
that
people
can
affix
temporarily
or
does
it
have
to
be
a
permanent?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
how
does
that
help
you?
meaning
to--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
how
is
the
public
going
to
use
that
plaque?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
is
the
public
going
to
use
that?
the
public
hangs
around
the
port
as
it's
loading
to
call
in
complaints?
