is
it
part
of
your
argument
that
the
city
contracts
with
the
port
and
then
the
port
contracts
with
the
truckers,
but
at
that
point,
the
ports
are
--
are
confined
in
what
they
can
do?
there
can
be
really
no
bargaining
between
the
ports
and
the
truckers
based
on
what
the
city
has
already
told
the
port?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
are
saying
that
you
can
do
by
contract
what
you
cannot
do
by
regulation.
and
i
don't
understand
that
argument
when
there
are
criminal
penalties
that
attach
to
the
breach
of
the
contract.
