justice
elena
kagan
castle's
didn't
say
that,
mr.
lerman.
what
if
the
court
is
just
saying,
we
want
to
keep
unsafe
trucks
off
the
road,
but
we're
not
prohibiting
you
for
past
violations
that
you've
cured.
all
we're
doing
is
keeping
unsafe
trucks
out
of
our
port.
justice
elena
kagan
but
why
does
that
--
why
does
it
have
to
be
truck
by
truck
rather
than
operator
by
operator?
why
can't
the
port
say,
you
know,
when
we
found
a
couple
of
trucks
that
this
company
uses
that
are
unsafe,
we're
just
going
to
keep
the
company
off
our
premises
until
the
company
can
show
us
that
they've
cured
all
their
trucks,
that
they
are
a
safe
operator
now.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
bash,
what
would
you
think
of
this
case
if
the
criminal
penalties
were
taken
out
of
it?
in
other
words,
if
the
port
did
this
all
through
contract,
basically
said
to
each
terminal
operator,
look,
if
you
contract
with
truckers
that
don't
have
this
concession
agreement,
we
are
going
to
charge
you
a
higher
price.
so
--
so
if
the
criminal
penalties
were
not
in
the
case,
is
there
enough
here
to
still
make
this
the
force
and
effect
of
law?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
rosenthal,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
a
second
and
just
make
sure
i
understand
what
your
policy
is?
who
do
you
exclude
from
the
port?
what
trucks
--
what
trucks
or
what
trucking
companies
do
you
exclude?
justice
elena
kagan
and
--
and
not
just
the
noncompliant
trucks,
but
the
entire
operator
who
are
having
some
noncompliant
trucks,
is
that
correct?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
you're
saying
there
isn't
that
experience,
i
mean,
could
--
are
you
in
a
position
actually
to
represent
that
you
would
not
exclude
anything
except
noncompliant
trucks?
justice
elena
kagan
this
case
concerns
the
preemption
of
trucking
regulations
at
the
port
of
los
angeles.
it's
our
second
case
this
term
about
the
preemptive
scope
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
authorization
act
or
faaaa.
that's
quite
a
lot
of
a's,
so
i'm
going
to
call
it
f4a
for
short.
the
los
angeles
port
is
the
largest
port
in
the
country.
it's
run
by
a
board
of
harbor
commissioners
under
a
city
ordinance
known
as
a
tariff.
the
port
owns
marine
terminal
facilities
which
at
leases
the
terminal
operators
that
load
and
unload
cargo
from
docking
ships.
short-haul
trucks
called
drayage
trucks
assist
in
those
operations
by
moving
cargo
into
and
out
of
the
port.
in
2007
and
response
to
neighbors
concerns
about
traffic
pollution
and
safety,
the
port
implemented
a
clean
truck
program.
as
part
of
that
program,
the
port
developed
the
standard
form
agreement
containing
a
number
of
requirements.
two
of
those
requirements
are
important
here.
one
requires
trucking
companies
to
display
a
placard
on
each
truck
with
a
phone
number
for
reporting
concerns.
the
other
requires
companies
to
submit
an
off-street
parking
plan.
the
other
provisions
of
the
agreement
deal
with
things
like
a
company's
financial
capacity,
truck
maintenance,
and
employment
of
drivers.
to
make
sure
the
drayage
companies
enter
into
the
agreement,
the
poor
amended
it's
tariff
which
again,
that's
municipal
law
to
make
it
a
criminal
offense
for
a
terminal
operator
to
grant
access
to
any
company
that
didn't
sign
the
agreement.
each
violation
is
punishable
by
up
to
six
months
in
prison.
the
petitioner
here,
american
trucking
association
or
ata
is
a
trade
group
that
represents
most
of
the
trucking
companies
at
the
port.
ata
filed
suit
arguing
primarily
that
the
f4a
preempts
that
is
invalidates
the
placard
and
parking
requirements
in
the
agreement.
the
district
court
found
out
that
neither
provision
was
preempted
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
today
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
and
hold
that
the
placard
and
parking
provisions
of
the
agreement
are
preempted.
the
f4a
preempts
any
state
or
local
provision
having
the
force
and
effect
of
law
that
deals
with
trucking
prices,
routes,
or
services.
that's
so
those
matters
are
the
special
providence
of
the
federal
government.
we've
held
in
the
past
that
language
of
that
kind,
the
force
and
effect
of
law
language,
draws
a
line
between
a
government's
exercise
of
regulatory
authority
and
its
own
proprietary
participation
in
a
market.
actions
that
fall
on
the
regulatory
side
of
the
line
are
preempted.
the
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
states
and
localities
are
not
to
be
involved
in
those
matters,
but
those
on
the
proprietary
side
of
the
line
where
the
state
or
locality
is
operating
just
as
a
commercial
actor
would
or
not
preempted.
now,
the
boundaries
of
that
line
might
sometimes
be
fuzzy,
but
the
outcome
here
is
quite
clear.
the
port
exercise
classic
regulatory
authority.
it
forced
terminal
operators
and
through
them
trucking
companies
to
alter
their
conduct
by
means
of
a
criminal
prohibition
backed
by
the
treat
of
imprisonment.
that
counts
as
action
having
the
force
and
effect
of
law
if
anything
does.
there
is
also
another
question
in
this
case
whether
our
decision
in
a
--
in
a
case
called
castle
versus
hayes
freight
lines,
prevents
the
port
from
enforcing
other
none
preemptive
provisions
of
the
agreement
by
borrowing
trucks
from
the
port.
but
we
decide
not
to
decide
that
question
today.
the
case
comes
to
us
in
a
pre-enforcement
posture
and
on
the
current
record,
we
cannot
tell
what
the
ports
enforcement
scam
really
is.
we
will
address
that
question
if
and
when
we
have
to
after
the
port
begins
to
enforce
its
agreement.
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
