ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
here
the
police
are
facing
a
destruction
of
critical
blood
alcohol
evidence.
every
minute
counts,
and
it's
reasonable
for
the
officers
to
proceed
without
a
warrant.
i
would
like
to
pick
up
where
some
of
the
court's
questions
led
off:
this
idea
that
we
might
live
in
a
world
where
warrants
could
be
gotten
so
quickly
that
there
is
not
true
exigency.
first
of
all,
that
is
not
state
of
the
world
now.
there
is
substantial
variation
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction,
and
we
are
just
not
in
a
place
where
the
time
to
get
the
warrant
everywhere
is
15
minutes
or
less.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no,
i
don't
think
that
that's
true
at
all.
the
police
do
not
have--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
that
if
the
world
changed
so
that
every
police
officer
had
an
ipad
and
that
judges
were
always
on
duty
and
that
the
warrants
could
be
gotten
that
quickly,
you
would
consider
that
and
you
would
also
consider
the
other
sources
of
delay,
which
are
the
time
to
get
to
the
hospital,
etcetera,
etcetera.
but
yes,
i
would--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--because--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
question--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right,
but
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
are
with
respect
to
the
destruction
of
evidence
and
what
the
police
are
witnessing.
they
know
there
is
certain
destruction
of
evidence
and
what
they
are
weighing
that
against
is
uncertainty
about
whether
there's
time
to
get
a
warrant.
they
have
no
idea
what
this
person's
blood
alcohol
content
is.
they
have
no
idea
how
fast
it's
decreasing.
they
might--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
there
are
legal
problems
with
that
and
practical
problems
with
that.
the
legal
problems
is
that
the
court
has
never
suggested
that
the
police
are
both
simultaneously
in
require-a-warrant
land
and
not
in
require-a-warrant
land.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
right.
i
mean,
in
all
of
the
destruction
of
evidence
cases
the
court
has
said:
there's
destruction
of
evidence;
we're
not
going
to
make
you
wait
until
half
of
it
is
destroyed
or
three-fourths
of
it
is
destroyed
or
something
like.
and
that's
the
rule
really
that
respondents
want.
everyone--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
suspect
that
nationwide
folks
could
get
warrants
in
those
circumstances.
you
typically
have
one
police
officer
on
the
scene
who
is
making
the
traffic
stop,
asking
the
person
questions,
taking
him
through
the
field
sobriety
test.
that
would
have
to
be
the
officer
who
would
do
the
affidavit
in
support
of
the
search
warrant
because
he's
the
one
who's
witnessing--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
i
mean,
a
couple
of
responses.
first
of
all,
this
court
makes
nationwide
rules
and
the
question
is
whether
it's
reasonable
to
do
what
missouri
did
here
even
if
other
jurisdictions
would
choose
to
or
could
do
it
differently.
but
second,
you
know,
this
idea
with
respect
to
--
that
it
should
matter
based
on
the
time
to
get
a
warrant
is
something
the
court
has
never
done
in
its
fourth
amendment
exigency
cases.
and
it
may
be
the
case
that
a
court
looking
backwards
could
say,
well,
we
think
you
had
enough
time
to
get
a
warrant.
but
the
police
officer
where
he
stands
with
the
person,
he
knows
a
few
things.
he
knows
one
thing
for
sure:
that
evidence
is
going
to
be
lost,
and
it's
critical
evidence.
it's
not
just
to
get
above.08,
but
you
have
these
laws
that
are
enhanced
with--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--right.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
but
the
court--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
it
matters
as
a
general--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
think
it
matters
as
a
general
matter
whether
warrants
take
time
to
get
and
whether
evidence
is
lost.
but
the
court
has
never
gone
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction.
it
has
never
second-guessed
the
police
in
the
way
that
the
court
is
suggesting
today.
in
kentucky
v.
king,
for
example,
an
exigency
case,
the
court
said
the
police
could
have
proceeded
a
couple
of
different
ways
here;
we
are
not
going
to
make
them
use
the
least
restrictive
way;
we
are
just
going
to
ask
whether
what
they
did
was
reasonable.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
well,
if
i
am
understanding
it
correctly,
i
think
our
point
is
this,
which
is
that
the
police
officers
have
to
act
reasonably
in
the
situation.
and
in
a
situation
they
know
for
sure
the
evidence
is
going
to
be
lost,
they
know
that
every
minute
is
critical.
for
example,
respondent
here's
blood--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--i
mean,
with
respect,
we
disagree.
this
evidence
is
critical,
and
the
number
matters.
i
mean,
it
is
the
case
that
blood
alcohol
evidence
is
the
most
important
evidence.
this
court
has
recognized
this
in
several
cases
--
schmerber,
skinner
--
and
since
then
the
law
has
only
changed
to
make
it
more
important.
in
2005
you
had--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--the
court
made
a
mention
of
2
hours,
but
that
was
not
a
critical
portion
of
its
analysis.
we
don't
think
that
that
mattered
to
schmerber
because
the
court
said,
first,
there
was
clear
probable
cause
in
that
situation.
second
of
all--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
it's
one
line
in
the
opinion.
if
you
look
at
it,
the
court
says,
we
are
told
the
percentage
of
alcohol
in
the
blood
begins
to
diminish
shortly
after
drinking
stops,
the
body
functions
to
eliminate
it
from
the
system.
particularly
in
a
case
like
this,
time
had
to
be
taken
to
bring
the
accused
to
a
hospital
and
to
investigate
the
scene--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
they
said
particularly
it
means
there's
an
extra
thing.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
first
thing
wasn't
enough.
and
what
we
say
is
if
there
was
some
uncertainty
in
schmerber,
the
court's--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
that
gives
me
the
second
part
of
my
answer,
which
is
the
court's
cases
since
schmerber
have
relied
on
the
destruction
of
this
evidence
being
enough
for
exigency.
and
i
would
just
point
the
court
to
look
at
skinner,
at
south
dakota
vs.
neville,
at
winston
vs.
lee,
and
even
in
a
footnote
in
kentucky
vs.
king.
this
court
has
not
said
anything
about
the
person
having
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
whether
there
was
an
investigation--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
because
in
that
situation,
i
think
they're
willing
to
take
their
chances
that
the
evidence
is
going
to
dissipate
below
the.08
standard
or
below
these
higher
enhanced
penalties,.15,
and
then
be
able
to
challenge
it,
as
opposed
to
if
they
gave
the
evidence
that
they
potentially
wouldn't
be
able
to
challenge
it.
but
i
think
the
point
that
comes--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers.
one,
you
typically
as
a
practical
matter
have
one
officer
on
the
scene
who's
proceeding
with
this
and
he's
the
one
that
would
have
to
prepare
the
affidavit,
typically
the
one
to
consult
with
the
prosecutor.
he's
the
one
who's
going
to
drive
to
the
hospital.
presumably,
we
don't
want
him
texting
during
driving,
et
cetera.
the
second
answer
is
a
legal
answer,
which
is
that
the
court
has
been
very
hesitant
to
second-guess
the
police
in
these
circumstances
and
to
say
when
the
police
are
in
a
fluid
situation
they
have
to,
say,
try
to
get
a
second
officer
on
the
scene
and
maybe
do
the--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
even
in
some
of
the
telephonic
--
telephonic
warrant
procedures,
you
still
have
to
have
a
written
document.
you
just
write
it
out
and
then
you
read
it
to
the
judge
and
then
actually
a
record
needs
to
be
made
of
it.
the
case
united
states
v.
reid
in
the
fourth
circuit
actually
considered
this
and
said:
you
know,
it
sounds
like
it
won't
take
that
long,
but
it
turns
out
these
procedures
actually
take
a
while.
and
it's
not
just
the
time
to
get
a
warrant.
it's
the
initial
time
that
had
been
taken
at
the
stop,
the
investigation,
the
field
sobriety
test.
then
there's
the
time
to
get
to
the
hospital.
and,
you
know,
sometimes
these
people,
these
folks,
get
to
the
hospital
and
they're
not
given
first
priority,
so
there's
sometimes
some
waiting
at
the
hospital.
so,
a
significant--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
we
think
that's
a
different
question
and
one
that
the
court
reserved
in
schmerber.
the
court
said
there
was
medical
personnel
in
a
medical
setting
taking
the
blood
in
that
case.
that's
the
exact
same
thing
that's
happening
here.
but
it
said
if
we
had
a
different
case,
we'd
ask
whether
the
--
the
situation
invited
an
unjustified
element
of
personal
risk
of
infection
and
pain.
so
we
think
the
court
should
get
a
case
that
has
a
record
on
this
and
then
it
could
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
there
is
that
risk.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true.
the
reason
that
a
few
states
have
considered
having
police
officers
get
trained
in
this
way
is
basically
out
of
necessity.
it
is
just
in
rural
jurisdictions
it's
too
far
to
get
to
the
nearest
hospital.
but
it's
fair
to
say
that
police
officers
do
not
want
to
be
in
this
business
of
taking
blood.
it
diverts
them
from
their
other
activities.
it's,
you
know,
it's
an
extensive
training
process.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true,
but
it's
not
something
the
court
has
to
decide--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
only
a
few
states
that
are
doing
it
now,
and
i
think
it
is
--
it
should
be
--
the
court
should
wait
until
it
actually
has
a
record
to
make
that
determination.
but,
you
know,
there
has
been
training
along
those
lines.
that's
something,
for
example,
that
nhtsa
at
the
department
of
transportation
has
helped
these
states
investigate
whether
it's
a
real
option,
because
the
police
officers
are
very
far
away
from,
you
know,
the
nearest
hospital
and
that
it's
--
it's
all
based
on
this
concern
about
destruction
of
evidence.
but
just
to
get
back
to--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--yes.
as
a
general
matter,
you
would
not
need
to
obtain
a
blood
test,
you
know,
practically,
because
the
evidence
is
not
the
same,
but,
you
know,
substantially
as
good.
the
blood
test
is
a
little
better
in
that
you
have
a
sample
that
sticks
around
as
opposed
to
one
that
is
gone.
you
also
get
two
samples,
so
the
defense
can
test
it,
and
it
is
better
evidence
with
respect
to
whether
it's
susceptible
to
challenge.
you
also
might
have
someone
who
consents
to
a
breath
test,
but
because,
as
you
pointed
out,
they're
so
drunk
they
can't
give
a
good
sample,
like
they
say
they'll
provide
a
sample,
but
they
really
just
can't.
and
then
there's
another
case
that
is
not
the
fact
here,
but
something
we
would
want
the
court
to
be
careful
about,
which
is
driving
under
the
influence
of
drugs.
those
do
not
show
up
on
a
breath
test,
but
the
police
officers
might
have
very
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
is
under
the
influence,
such
that
they
might
take
a
breath
test
and
get
a
zero
reading,
but
still
want
to
take
a
warrantless
blood
test.
so,
all
the
court
needs
to
do
to
resolve
this
case
is
say
where
this
person
refused
a
breathalyzer
--
actually,
the
exact
same
facts
of
schmerber
--
it
was
--
it
was
reasonable
for
the
police
to
say,
we
know
this
evidence
is
going
away,
we
know
it's
going
to
be
lost,
maybe
we
can
get
a
warrant
quickly,
maybe
we
can't,
we
don't
know
what
his
blood
alcohol
is,
we
don't
know
when
it's
going
to
dip
below.15,.08,
let's
just
go
ahead
and
proceed.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
no.
i
mean,
the
--
the
question
you'd
ask
will
be
the
same,
which
would
be
a
reasonableness
balancing
test,
but
i
think
the
government
interest
on
the
side
of
that
balance
would
be
very
different
from
the
ones
at
issue
here.
you
know,
the
court
here
has
said
that
drunk
driving
is
a
serious
public
safety
problem.
we're
talking
about
one
person
being
killed
every
51
minutes,
despite
everything
we've
done
in
the
last
3
decades.
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
yes.
that's
what
the
court
did
in
schmerber.
it
looked
at
the
intrusiveness
of
the
blood
test
in
this
context
and
then
it
looked
at
the
government's
need
for
the
evidence.
and
the
need
for
the
evidence
in
the
cases
you're
positing
we
suspect
the
court
would
not
think
as
strong
as
the
evidence
here.
but
just
to
get
back
to
some
of
the
questions
the
court
has
had
about
the
time
to
get
warrants,
i
mean,
the
evidence
that
the
court
has
before
it
is
that
it
would
take
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
to
2
hours
to
get
a
warrant
here.
that's
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
54.
even
though
the
person
said
--
one
officer
said
he
could
get
in
touch
with
the
prosecutor
and
judge,
he
did
not
quantify
how
long
it
would
take.
there's
also
an
exhibit
that
the
defense--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--it's
not
entirely
clear,
but
i
think
it's
2
hours
total.
there
was
also
on
page
70
of
the
joint
appendix
an
exhibit
that
the
defense
put
in
that
make
it
look
like
one
and
a
half
hours
to
2
hours
total.
i
also--
ms.
nicole
a.
saharsky
--there's
one
other
piece
of
data,
which
is
a
nhtsa
study
that's
referred
to
in
the
briefs,
about
where
the
court
--
where
folks
in
four
states
where
warrants
were
required
tried
to
get
them
quickly
as
possible.
they
put
the
judges
on
staff,
they
tried
to
do
it
electronically
as
much
as
possible,
and
still
there
it
was
one
and
half
to
2
hours.
that's
on
page
37
of
that
study.
thank
you.
