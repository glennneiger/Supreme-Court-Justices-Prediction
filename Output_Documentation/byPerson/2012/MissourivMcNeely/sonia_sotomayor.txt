justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
come
it
took
so
long
for
this
state
to
figure
out
that
it
needed
to
do
this
without
a
warrant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
officer
testified
that
he's
been
making
drunk
driving
arrests
for
years--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--and
i
think
in
only
one
circumstance
did
he
need
to
do
it
without
a
warrant.
so
what
made
the
need
here
eminently
the
sense
of
impractical
to
get
the
warrant?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
i
understand
why
he
decided
to
do
it,
to
forego
getting
a
warrant.
isn't
his
testimony
dispositive
of
this
case?
he
had
time
to
get
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
it
took
a
considerable
amount
of
time
for
all
the
years
he
did
it.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
--
and
he
didn't
testify
to
it
causing
a
loss
of
any
particular
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
constitutional
right
exists
for
a
state
to
get
the
best
evidence?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
no,
no,
no.
you,
the
state,
want
to
strive
for
that.
but
what
in
the
fourth
amendment
contemplates
that
that's
a
right
the
state
must
have,
that
is
has
to
get
the
very
best
evidence
it
can?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
can
it
be
reasonable
to
forego
the
fourth
amendment
in
a
procedure
as
intrusive
as
a
needle
going
into
someone's
body?
i
say
this
because
breathalyzers
in
my
mind
have
a
much
different
intrusion
level.
they
don't
intrude
into
your
body.
and
i
think
almost
all
jurisdictions
use
breathalyzers
instead
of
blood
tests.
a
small
fraction
that
actually
use
blood
tests.
the
ruling
by
us
today
is
going
to
change
that
and
is
going
to
--
if
in
your
favor
is
going
to
change
that
and
is
going
to
--
if
in
your
favor,
is
going
to
change
that
and
put
sort
of
a
print,
the
court's
print,
on:
use
the
most
intrusive
way
you
can
to
prove
your
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
the
new
rule
is
we
have
to
strengthen
--
the
fourth
amendment
is
going
to
be
suspended
whenever
the
prosecution
can't
get
the
best
evidence
to
make
its
case
out?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
do
you
define
reasonableness--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--so
would
the
importance
of
the
search
warrant
suggest,
as
a
constitutional
right,
suggest
that
we
should
judge
reasonableness
by
the
people
who
are
the
least
efficient
or
by
the
people
who
are
the
most
reasonably
efficient?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning
people,
police
jurisdictions.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
absolutely,
but
should
they
--
should
we
permit
them
to
vary
in
terms
of
inefficiency
or
should
we
be
encouraging
them
to
vary
within
a
reasonable
range?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
are
so
many
situations
in
which
we
require
a
warrant,
nevertheless.
when
there
is
drug
dealing
in
a
house,
every
time
people
enter
that
house,
it's
almost
a
certainty
that
they're
going
to
use
the
drugs
and
that
evidence
is
going
to
disappear.
you
rely
on
hope
--
on
knowing
that
there's
likely
to
be
telltale
signs
left
over.
and
that's
the
same
thing
you
do
in
an
alcohol
situation.
you
rely
on
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer,
you
rely
on
the
implied
consent
presumption.
it's
not
as
if
this
is
destruction
of
all
evidence,
and
not
like
a
fleeing
situation
where
someone
gets
away,
you
have
nothing
left.
this
is
--
this
is
vastly
different.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
it
okay
--
is
it
okay
to
let
police
officers
take
the
blood?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
i
bet
that
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
we
will.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
want
to
be
in
those
rural
places
and
be
stopped
without
an
independent
magistrate
approving
a
field
officer
taking
blood
from
you?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
shapiro,
could
you
tell
me,
and
what
i
am
deeply
troubled
about
in
your
argument,
is
you
incant
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test.
but
what
circumstances
is
the
court
actually
looking
at
to
determine
whether
forgoing
the
warrant
was
necessary
or
not
under
that
circumstance?
we
know
one.
we
know
where
a
fatality
has
occurred
or
a
serious
accident,
because
we
--
presumably
you
have
to
secure
the
scene
and
you
have
to
take
care
of
injured
people
or
have
cars
towed,
whatever
else
it
is.
but
i'm
not
sure
what
other
circumstances
under
your
theory
would
really
justify
a
magistrate
--
a
court
below
saying,
you
--
you
know,
it's
okay,
you
can
get
a
warrant
here.
it
can't
be
merely
because
it
takes
too
long
to
get
the
warrant
because
that
shows
inefficiency.
it
was
part
of
my
question
earlier.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
shapiro,
could
you
go
back
to
what
in
this
conversation
we
sort
of
have
lost
focus
of,
which
is
the
question
presented,
and
which
is
the
essence,
i
think,
of
your
adversary's
arguments.
i'm
not
sure
you've
really
put
forth
--
the
essence
of
their
argument
is
that
you
can
forego
the
warrants
requirement
when
you
know
for
a
fact
that
evidence
is
going
to
dissipate
over
time.
basically,
they're
saying
this
process
undermines
our
right
to
get
a
warrant,
because
the
evidence
is
dissipating.
we
certainly
have
cases
that
talk
about
destruction
of
evidence
being
a
reason
to
forego
the
warrant.
what
makes
this
case
different
from
those?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
sure.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
this
is
a
case
about
when
the
police
must
obtain
a
warrant
before
conducting
a
non-consensual
blood
test
of
the
drunk-driving
suspect.
respondent
tyler
mcneely
was
pulled
over
the
middle
of
the
night
after
a
highway
patrol
officer
observed
him
driving
erratically.
mcneely
also
exhibited
other
signs
of
intoxication
and
he
admitted
that
he
have
had
a
couple
of
beers
at
a
bar.
after
mcneely
performed
poorly
on
several
sobriety
tests,
the
officer
asked
him
to
take
a
breathalyzer
test.
he
declined.
the
officer
took
mcneely
without
his
consent
to
a
nearby
hospital
for
a
blood
test
instead.
the
subsequent
testing
revealed
that
mcneely's
blood
alcohol
concentration
or
bac
was
well
above
the
legal
limit.
mcneely
was
charged
with
driving
while
intoxicated.
he
moved
to
suppress
the
blood
test
arguing
that
drawing
his
blood
without
a
search
warrant
violated
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
a
trial
court
agreed.
the
court
concluded
that
it
would
have
been
practical
under
the
circumstances
for
the
officer
to
obtain
a
warrant
and
that
there
was
no
evidence,
the
officer
faced
an
emergency.
the
state
appealed
arguing
that
the
loss
of
evidence
that
results
from
the
body's
natural
processing
of
alcohol
is
on
its
own,
a
sufficient
basis
for
acting
without
a
warrant.
after
an
intermediate
court
transferred
the
case,
the
missouri
supreme
court
affirmed.
the
missouri
supreme
court
stated
that
the
permissibility
of
a
warrantless
blood
draw
should
be
through
--
determined
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
court
held
that
the
fact
that
alcohol
is
naturally
metabolized
does
not
create
a
per
se
emergency
that
allows
police
officers
to
conduct
the
blood
draw
without
a
warrant
in
every
case.
and
the
court
concluded
that
in
mcneely's
case,
there
were
no
circumstances
or
special
factors
that
made
a
warrantless
blood
test
reasonable.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
split
in
authority
on
the
question
whether
the
natural
dissipation
of
bac
evidence
constitutes
an
inherent
emergency
that
justifies
warrantless
blood
draws
in
all
drunk-driving
investigations.
we
now
affirm.
our
cases
have
recognized
that
before
the
police
may
conduct
to
search
of
a
person,
they
must
generally
have
a
warrant.
that
principle
applies
to
the
search
here
which
involved
the
physical
needle
intrusion
beneath
mcneely's
skin
to
recover
evidence
of
a
crime
requiring
law
enforcement
officers
to
obtain
authorization
from
a
neutral
magistrate
judge
before
invading
a
person's
body
in
search
of
evidence
helps
protect
people's
deep
rooted
expectations
of
privacy
and
the
integrity
of
their
bodies.
one
well-established
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
this
is
so
called
exigent
circumstances.
we
have
applied
that
exception
in
a
variety
of
contexts
including
as
is
relevant
here
when
the
police
need
to
act
to
prevent
the
evident
destruction
of
evidence.
in
evaluating
whether
law
enforcement
officers
face
exigent
circumstances,
we
have
consistently
looked
to
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
this
is
the
approach
we
applied
in
schmerber
versus
california
where
we
upheld
the
warrantless
blood
draw
based
on
the
circumstances
presented
and
it
is
an
approach
we
adhere
to
today.
the
state
of
missouri
supported
by
several
amici
including
the
united
states
contend
that
exigent
circumstances
always
exists
in
drunk-driving
cases
because
the
human
body
naturally
breaks
down
alcohol
and
as
a
result,
bac
evidence
is
constantly
being
lost.
we
reject
this
proposed
categorical
rule
as
overly
broad.
while
it
is
sometimes
reasonable
for
police
officers
to
conduct
warrantless
blood
test
when
officers
can
obtain
a
warrant
without
undermining
the
search,
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
they
do
so.
for
reasons,
we
explained
in
greater
detail
in
our
opinion.
we
conclude
that
it
is
sometimes
practical
for
police
officers
to
obtain
a
warrant
before
conducting
a
blood
draw.
the
dissipation
of
bac
evidence
is
gradual
and
fairly
predictable.
some
delay
is
inherent
to
blood
testing
independent
of
the
warrant
process
and
innovations
and
telecommunications
have
dramatically
reduced
our
average
warrant
processing
times
in
many
jurisdictions.
it
is
accordingly
not
the
case
that
exigent
circumstance
will
exist
so
as
to
justify
a
warrantless
blood
draw
in
every
drunk-driving
investigation.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
missouri
took
an
all
or
nothing
position
basing
its
argument
entirely
on
the
contention
that
the
natural
dissipation
of
alcohol
in
the
blood
constitutes
a
per
se
emergency
in
every
case.
we,
therefore,
have
no
occasion
to
elaborate
on
the
various
circumstances
in
which
a
warrantless
blood
draw
must
--
would
be
permissible.
having
rejected
to
sole
argument
presented
to
us
challenging
the
missouri
supreme
court's
decision,
we
affirm
that
court's
judgment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in

in
which

breyer
and

joined.
