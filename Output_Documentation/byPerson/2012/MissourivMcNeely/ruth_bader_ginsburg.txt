but
he
said
--
he
said
in
the
ten
or
so
cases
he
had
had
in
the
past,
i
had
--
i
encountered
no
difficulty
getting
a
warrant
in
prior
cases.
there
was
nothing
that
distinguished
this
case
on
the
facts
from
other
cases
on
the
facts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
probable
cause
is
not
enough.
if
you
have
probable
cause,
then
you
can
get
a
warrant.
but
it
was
and
i
think
still
is
the
main
rule
that
if
you
can
get
a
warrant,
you
must
do
that.
probable
cause
is
surely
not
enough.
then
we'd
never
need
a
warrant
when
there's
probable
cause.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
do
have
--
we
do
have,
i
think,
an
indication
that
there
are
jurisdictions
that
do
it
inside
of
a
half-hour.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
saharsky,
what
about
saying
at
least
they
should
try,
since
a
number
of
jurisdictions
can
do
this
within
a
half
hour,
say,
initiate
the
process
while
you
are
going
to
the
hospital;
when
a
half-hour
is
up
you
proceed;
but
at
least
there
has
been
an
effort
to
get
a
warrant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mentioned
schmerber.
why
did
the
court
go
through
all
of
the
--
why
--
it
could
have
made
it
a
much
shorter
opinion
by
simply
saying,
yes,
blood
alcohol
dissipates.
but
it
didn't.
it
pointed
out
that
in
that
particular
case
there
was
a
delay
to
investigate
the
accident,
the
person
had
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital
for
care,
so
how
much
time
elapsed?
i
think
it
was
2
hours,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
all
the
--
why
was
it
in
the
opinion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
they
didn't
need
to
say
any
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
that
field
sobriety
test?
suppose
the
person
who
is
apprehended
and
is
suspected
of
being
drunk
says,
i'm
not
going
to
walk
a
straight
line.
i'm
just
going
to
sit
here.
you
can't
make
me
do
anything
without
a
warrant.
do
you
need
--
if
the
defendant
doesn't
consent,
do
you
need
a
warrant
to
have
the
standard
sobriety
test?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
you're
saying
is
if
it's
now
or
never--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
the
other
is
a
slow
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shapiro,
before
your
time
runs
out,
the
case
of
the
fingernail--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--scrapings
has
been
raised
as
saying
well,
that's
--
somebody
is
going
to
scrape
your
fingernails,
that's
as
intrusive
as
a
blood
test.
