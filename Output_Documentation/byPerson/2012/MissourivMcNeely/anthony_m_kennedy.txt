justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
are
talking
about
reasonableness,
do
you
think
it's
relevant
for
us
to
look
to
the
rules
and
practices
of
other
states?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
fact
that
those
states
do
have
a
warrant
requirement
and
from
what
we
can
best
tell
make
it
work
very
well,
including
some
expedited
procedures
where
you
can
get
warrants
within
minutes
--
it
takes
usually
the
policemen,
say,
20
minutes
to
get
just
to
the
hospital
or
the
police
station
anyway.
and
if
--
if
we
see
that
other
states,
a
significant
amount
of
other
states,
number
one,
require
the
warrant,
number
two,
many
of
those
have
expedited
procedures,
does
that
bear
on
our
determination
of
reasonableness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we
have
always
--
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
think
that
we
have
always
thought
of
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
standards
as
being
a
national
standard.
suppose
40
states
--
you
know,
we
can
play
the
game.
suppose
40
states
had
rules
that
you
have
warrants
and
many
of
them
had
expedited
procedures.
that's
still
irrelevant?
we
don't
look
at
that
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
showing
that
conviction
rate
in
those
states
is
lower
than
in
the
states
where
the
practice
is
to
take
the
test
without
the
warrant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
have
--
i
don't
want
to,
because
you
have
multiple
answers
--
but
on
that
point,
we
do
talk
about
exigent
circumstances.
if
we
proceed
as
justice
ginsburg's
suggestion
indicates,
then
the
fact
that
you
can't
get
a
warrant
within
45
minutes
is
the
exigent
circumstance.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
justice
ginsburg
said
30
minutes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
--
i
thought
that
we
often
said
that
you
look
at
whether
or
not
you
can
get
a
warrant
before
you
can
break
in
so
that
the
drugs
aren't
flushed
down
the
toilet
and
so
forth.
we
make
that
judgment
all
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
that
showing
is
not
made,
you
must
get
a
warrant.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
think
it's
quite
incorrect
to
say
that
we
--
we
don't
look
at
the
time
factor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
look
at
it
all
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
agree
that
there
is
a
uniform
standard.
but
--
and
i
don't
know
if
you
ever
did
finish
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
but
she
had
suggested
that
we
have
a
uniform
rule
of
exigent
circumstances.
that
--
her
suggestion
complies
with
your
objection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
i
think
you
should
be
fair.
he
doesn't
have
to
prepare
a
written
affidavit
in
a
number
of
these
states.
it's
a
telephonic
warrant.
you
have
to
give
us
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
incidentally,
it
wasn't
clear
to
me:
is
that
1
hour
from
the
time
of
the
--
pardon
me
--
2
hours
from
the
time
of
the
stop
or
2
hours
from
the
time
he
put
him
in
the
back
of
the
patrol
car?
do
we
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
magistrate
is
unavailable
because
he
or
she
is
ill?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
that
that's
an
exigent
circumstance
which
would
allow
a
warrantless
blood
sample?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
--
we
know
the
defense
attorneys
love
it
when
there's
a
delay,
because
then
the
retrograde
analysis
has
more
and
more
contingencies
that
make
it
unreliable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
you'd
much
rather
examine
the
state's
expert
if
the
sample
was
taken
three
hours
than
if
it
were
--
after
the
arrest
than
one.
i
mean,
that's
a
given.
