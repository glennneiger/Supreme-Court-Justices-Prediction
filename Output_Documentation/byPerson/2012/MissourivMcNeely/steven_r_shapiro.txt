mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
may
stick
a
needle
in
the
arm
of
everyone
arrested
on
suspicion
of
drunk
driving
without
a
warrant
and
without
consent.
missouri's
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
even
in
routine
dwi
cases
like
this
and
regardless
of
how
quickly
and
easily
a
warrant
could
be
obtained.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
the
question
is
--
it's
not
clear
to
me.
number
one,
your
honor,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
driver
is
always
first
offered
the
opportunity,
the
choice
of
choosing
a
breathalyzer
as
opposed
to--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--this
client
was
offered
the
breathalyzer,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
and
declined
it
twice,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
under
missouri's
proposed
rule,
there
is
no
role
at
all
for
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
the
decision
whether
an
individual
can
be
required
to
submit
to
a
nonconsensual
blood
draw,
often
while
handcuffed
and
physically
restrained
as
my
client
was--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--right.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
i'd
be
happy
to
answer
that
question
right
now,
your
honor.
i
think
there
are
two
responses.
one
is
missouri
specific
and
case
specific
and
one
is
more
generic,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
they
are
not
asking
simply
to
reverse
the
suppression
motion
in
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
facts
of
this
case
made
it
reasonable
to
do
a
warrantless
blood
draw.
what
missouri
and
the
united
states
are
urging
is
a
categorical
exemption
to
the
warrant
requirement
in
all
dwi
cases
nationwide.
so
we
have
to
think
not
only
about--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--your
honor,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
but
i
think
it's
also
true,
your
honor,
that
warrants
in
general
are
never
turned
down,
that
the
overwhelming
percentage
of
warrant
requests
in
all
criminal
cases
are
granted
--
are
granted
by
magistrates.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
this
court's
entire
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence,
your
honor,
rests
on
the
proposition
that
the
privacy
safeguards
of
the
fourth
amendment
benefit
by
having
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
review
the
evidence
before
the
state
does
something
as
intrusive
as
putting
a
needle
in
somebody's
arm.
and
i
could
imagine
a
situation--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
it's
something
very
close
to
what
missouri
already
has,
your
honor.
in
cape
girardeau
county
the
prosecutor
has
prepared
standardized
forms
which
the
police
officer
then
fills
out,
presents
to
the
prosecutor,
the
prosecutors
sends
on
to
the
magistrate
and
the
magistrate
decides
whether
to
grant
the
warrant.
but
i
think
that
cuts
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction,
which
it
shows
that
the
process
of
obtaining
a
warrant
is
not
very
elaborate
and
it
need
it
not
be
very
timely.
and
i
can
imagine,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
questions,
i
can
imagine
circumstances
in
which
an
officer
might
apply
for
a
warrant
in
a
situation
where
they
have
not
asked
the
driver,
for
example,
to
go
through
the
field
sobriety
test;
said
as
they
--
as
we
stopped
the
driver
on
the
road,
he
was
going
10
miles
over
the
speed
limit,
i
questioned
him,
his
speech
was
slurred,
his
eyes
seemed
bloodshot,
i
want
to
do
a
blood
test.
and
the
magistrate
in
that
circumstance
might
say,
did
you
at
least
perform
the
field
sobriety
test?
did
you
at
least
offer--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--do
you
mean
do
you
need
a
warrant
to
have
the
field
sobriety
test?
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
is
that
the
question,
justice
ginsburg?
i
don't
think
you
need
a
warrant
to
require
somebody
to
put
his
finger
to
his
nose
or
to
walk
a
straight
line
or
to
stand
on
one
foot.
i
would
not
say
that
that
is
a
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
triggers
the
warrant
requirement.
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
putting
a
needle
in
somebody's
arm
triggers
a
warrant
requirement.
and
i
think
there
are
really
two--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
think
you
probably
do
need
a
warrant
for
a
breathalyzer,
your
honor.
but
missouri's
position
is
you
not
only
don't
need
a
warrant
for
a
breathalyzer,
you
don't
need
a
warrant
for
a
blood
test.
and
we
don't
--
this
is
not
a
breathalyzer
case.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
i
think,
your
honor,
it
--
i
would
say
that
requiring
somebody
to
produce,
to
breathe
into
a
machine
for
--
in
order
to
gather
evidence
for
the
state's
prosecution
is
a
state
--
is
a
search
that
should
probably
trigger
the
warrant
requirement,
but
it
is
certainly
a
less
--
it
is
certainly
less
intrusive,
your
honor,
it
is
certainly
less
intrusive
than
--
than
the
blood
test--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
i
certainly
don't
want
to
bite
--
i
want
to
bite
off--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--your
honor,
i
certainly
want
to
bite
off
as
little
as
i
have
to
chew
in
this
case,
but
there
are
two
salient
facts
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus
on
what
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
and
what
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
a
warrantless
blood
draw,
and
the
two
salient
facts
in
my
mind
are,
one,
as
i
said,
case
specific.
you
have
a
state
trooper
here
who
has
been
doing
this
for
17
and
a
half
years.
he
testifies
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
he
has
only
been
required
to
seek
a
warrant
fewer
than
ten
times.
why
is
that?
that
is
because
the
overwhelming
number
of
drivers,
in
fact,
give
their
consent.
and
in
the
ten
cases
over
those
17
years
where
he
had
to
seek
a
warrant,
he
testifies
that
he
never
had
any
difficulty
obtaining
a
warrant,
and
there
is
certainly
no
indication
that
those
warrants
in
any
way
interfered
with
the
state's
ability
to
prosecute
those
cases.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
yes,
so
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
got
it
right
in
schmerber.
i
think
the
question
is:
are
there
special
facts
that
are
extrinsic
to
the
warrant
process
itself
and
that
are
beyond
the
control
of
the
police
that
significantly
impede
the
ability
of
the
police
even
to
initiate
the
warrant
process.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
well,
your
honor,
cape
girardeau
county
is
a
rural
county
in
southeastern
missouri--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
would
say
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
the
state
ought
to
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
its
own
failure
to
modernize
an
expedited--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--then
i
think
that's
a
different
situation,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
think
it
might
well
if
the
magistrate
were
unavailable
and
there
were
no
alternative
magistrate.
but
the
second
salient
fact,
your
honor--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--that
is
correct,
justice
kagan.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
that
is
correct,
justice
kagan.
and
the
second
fact
i
just
wanted
to
come
back
to,
and
this
came
up
briefly
during
my
opponent's
argument,
is
we
know
that
there
are
half
the
states
in
the
country
by
our
count,
26
states
in
the
country
that
by
statute
have
prohibited
warrantless
blood
draws
in
routine
dwi
cases.
they
are
listed
on
page
31
of
the
red
brief
in
footnote
9.
given
that
fact,
in
the
face
of
that
reality,
i
don't
think
missouri
can
plausibly
claim
that
a
categorical
rule
that
would
then
apply
nationwide
if
this
court
were
to
announce
it
in
the
context
of
this
case
that
warrants
are
never
required
in
routine
dwi
cases,
could
satisfy
the
standard
that
this
court
has
established,
namely
that
the
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
that
is
being
proposed
serves
law
enforcement
needs
so
compelling
that
a
warrantless
search
is
objectively
reasonable
in
every
case.
there
is
no
evidence
that
i
am
aware
of,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
and
there
is
certainly
no
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
or
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
that
those
25
states
that
prohibit
warrantless
blood
draws
in
the
circumstances
that
my
client
confronted
here
have
a
lower
conviction
rate,
are
less
concerned--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
i
would
say
several
things.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
i
really
do
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
there's
any
jurisdiction
in
the
country
at
this
point
that
is
not
deeply
concerned
about
drunk
driving,
or
recognizes
that
drunk
driving
is
a
serious
problem.
that
is
certainly
not
our
position.
secondly,
the
reason
i
think
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
in
the
states
that
prohibit
warrantless
blood
draws
in
routine
dwi
cases
like
this
have
lower
conviction
rates
is,
number
one,
in
most
cases,
they
can
obtain
consent;
number
two,
in
cases
where
they
can't
obtain
consent,
they
have
been
able
to
obtain
warrants
in
a
timely
--
in
a
timely
fashion.
and
number
three,
even
in
the
absence
of
warrants,
all
the
facts
that
lead
to
probable
cause
often
create
a
very
compelling
case
for
conviction
in
the
absence
of
the
blood
alcohol--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
have
enormous
confidence
in
you,
justice
breyer.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
well,
well
--
well,
our
--
our
position,
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
you're
classifying
this
as
our
first
position
or
something
else
--
our
position
is
that
within
the
context
of
schmerber,
if
there
are
special
facts
external
to
the
warrant
requirement,
then
you
have
to
apply
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
and
you
ought
to
apply
a
reasonableness
standard.
in
the
context
of
the
delays
that
are
intrinsic
to
the
warrant
requirement,
absent
any
evidence
that
those
intrinsic
delays
have
interfered
with
the
ability
of
25
states
in
the
country
to
enforce
their
drunk
driving
laws,
this
court
ought
not
to
adopt
a
categorical
exception
to
the
--
to
the
warrant
requirement.
and
the
risk
of
doing
it,
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
breyer,
is
then
you
create
this
odd
disincentive,
which
is
the
states
that
have
the
slowest
and
most
cumbersome
warrant
procedures
are
the
states
that
get
a
free
pass
and
are
able
to
override
the
fourth
amendment.
that
seems
to
me--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
there
is
some
advantage
to
having
--
certainly,
a
search
that
is
conducted
pursuant
to
a
warrant
is
much
less
subject
to
suppression
than
a
search
that
is
subject
not
pursuant
to
a
warrant.
but
--
but
there
is
generally
speaking
in
these
cases
a
probable
cause
that
is
derived
from
the
officer's
observations
on
the
scene
and
the
defendant's
performance
in
the
field
sobriety
test,
that
--
that,
you
know,
can
support
the
warrant
--
support
--
support
the
search.
but
i
think--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
don't
--
excuse
me
--
i
don't
think
the
fourth
amendment
rule
turns
on
the
amount
of
blood
that
you
take
out
of
somebody's
body.
i
think
the
fourth
--
an
important,
maybe
not
the
important
dividing
line,
an
important
dividing
line
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
is
puncturing
the
skin,
and
the
court
has
recognized
this
in
other
circumstances.
and
i
think--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--this
court
has
said
that,
your
honor--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--in
a
variety
of
circumstances
with
drug
testing
cases,
where
they
weren't
even
law
enforcement
cases,
they
were
special
needs
cases.
the
court--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
think
that
--
i
think
that's
probably
--
i
think
that's
probably
correct,
your
honor.
you
presumably
do
not
need
a
search
warrant,
a
search
warrant
for
that.
and
this
court
held,
first
in
schmerber
and
then
reaffirmed
in
south
dakota
v.
neville,
that
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
issue
in
requiring
the
defendant
to
produce
the
evidence
that
can
then
be
used
against
you.
so
we
know
we're
not
talking
about
a
self-incrimination
problem;
we're
talking
about
a
search
and
seizure
problem.
and
if
the
government
were
able
to
obtain
the
evidence
in
a
way
that
did
not
rise
to
the
level
of
a
search,
then
the
warrant
requirement
wouldn't
apply.
but
we
are
not
there.
we're
not
there.
and
--
and
the
--
the
warrant
process
that
--
that
missouri
has
described
is
--
is
not
as
complicated.
there
are
many
places
now
that,
number
one,
permit
not
only
telephonic
warrants
but
electronic
warrants,
where
officers
are
equipped
in
their
patrol
cars
with
laptop
computers.
they
can
fill
out
these
pre-prepared
forms
in
a
matter
of
minutes
--
e-mail
them
to
the--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--but
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable,
your
honor,
and
it's
because
we
all
recognize
that
the
evidence
in
these
cases
is
relatively
routinized,
and
the
procedures
are
relatively
standardized.
but
that
does
not
mean
there
is
not
a
value
to
the
warrant
process,
and
to
the
second
look
by
a
mutual
detached
magistrate.
and
the
value
of--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i'd
be
happy
to
answer
that
question,
justice
sotomayor,
if
i
could
just
complete
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice
for
one
second.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
and
my
answer
would
be
that
even
if
there
are
boxes
on
a
standardized
form,
there
is
value
to
making
sure
that
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
have
checked
off
all
the
right
boxes
before
they
engage
in
a
process
as
intrusive
as
putting
a
needle
in
somebody's
arm.
now,
in
answer
to
justice
sotomayor's
question,
i
think
--
i
think
there
are
multiple
answers,
your
honor.
first,
this
court
has
on
two
previous
occasions
considered
and
rejected
the
notion
that
the
mere
fact
that
alcohol
dissipates
over
time
is
itself
sufficient
to
proceed
without
a
warrant.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
in
schmerber,
the
court's
discussion
of
what
the
court
itself
called
special
facts
would
have
been
unnecessary
if
all
the
court
needed
to
say
was
that
this
natural
dissipation
of
alcohol
in
the
blood
automatically
would
lead
to--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--i
think
the
special
facts,
your
honor,
were
the
accident
and
the
injuries
at
the
scene,
which
delayed
the
police
for
2
hours
before
they
could
even
get
to
the
hospital
and
initiate
the
process
of
applying
for
a
warrant,
at
a
time
when
there
were
no
cell
phones,
there
were
no
faxes,
there
were
no
internets,
and
all
warrant
applications
had
to
be
presented
in
person.
that's
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
excuse
me?
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
perhaps.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
practical
limitation,
whether
or
not
there
were
other
officers
on
the
scene,
right,
or
that
could
have
been
sent
to
the
scene,
we're
not
asking
for
a
rule
in
which
this
court
would
direct
police
officers
how
they
--
they
ought
to
deploy
their
resources.
if
there
are
multiple
police
officers
on
the
scene,
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable
to
say
one
can
attend
to
the
accident
and
the
other
one
can
search
--
can
search
for
a
warrant,
and
that
becomes
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
but
schmerber
is
not
the
only
case,
your
honor.
in
--
in
welsh
v.
wisconsin,
the
court
expressly
said
that
the
mere
dissipation
of
alcohol
in
the
blood
was
not
sufficient
to
justify
a
warrantless
entry
into
a
defendant's
home
in
order
to
arrest
the
defendant
on
dwi
charges.
it's
explicit
holding,
it's
not
simply
an
inference
that
one
has
to
draw
from
schmerber.
the
second
thing
i
would
say
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
sotomayor,
is
--
is
--
is
biology.
and
that
it
is
true
that
alcohol
dissipates
over
time
through
natural
body
processes.
but
that's
only
after
the
blood
alcohol
level
has
reached
its
peak,
and
that
is
generally
about
half
an
hour
after
somebody
has
had
his
last
drink.
so
there
is
a
period
of
time
in
which
the
blood
--
the
body
is
continuing
to
absorb
alcohol
and
then
--
and
the
blood
alcohol
level
is
continuing
to
rise.
only
at
peak
does
it
then
start
to
dissipate.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
the
relevance
of
that
is
that
it
is
not
true
that
in
every
--
it
won't
be
true
in
every
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
state
is
losing
evidence
with
each
passing
moment.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
well--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
you
may
or
may
not
know,
depending
on
what
the
--
the
person
is
willing
to
tell
you.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
every
case,
in
every
case,
it's
not
the
situation
that
from
the
moment
you
stop
the
driver,
his
blood
alcohol
level
is
going
down.
there
will
be
some
cases
where
it
is
going
up.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
right.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
right.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
because
the
process
is
a
very
different
process.
in
the
typical
drug
case,
which
is
what
this
court
has
considered
when
it
has
examined
the
question
of
whether
the
destruction
of
evidence
qualifies
as
an
exigent
circumstance,
that
question
has
almost
always
arisen
in
what
i'll
call
a
typical
drug
case,
richards
v.
wisconsin,
kentucky
v.
king.
and
in
those
situations,
what
the
court
is
worried
about
is
that
the
suspect
inside
the
house
is
going
to
flush
the
drugs
down
the
toilet.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
it
is
now
or--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--it
is
now
or
never
and
not
only
is
it
now
or
never,
that
--
but
in
most
of
those
cases,
probably
not
all,
but
in
most
of
the
cases,
the
state's
case
is
going
to
disappear
down
the
drain
along
with
the
drugs
and
the
ability
to
destroy
the
drugs
lies
entirely
within
the
control
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
gets
to
decide
whether
he's
going
to
put
the
drugs
down
the
toilet
or
not
and
when
he
does,
the
destruction
is
immediate
and
total.
in
this
situation,
the
process
is
gradual.
it
takes
hours.
it
can
take
hours,
depending
upon
how
much
alcohol
is
--
is
in
the
system
and
it
is
outside
the
control
of
the
suspect.
there
is
nothing
that
the
suspect
can
do
to
expedite
the
process
of
the
destruction
of
evidence.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
that
may
be
--
that
may--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--there
is
--
there
is
--
there
is
no
doubt,
justice
kennedy,
first
of
all,
the
retrograde
extrapolation
evidence,
which
is
now
being
considered
in
various
courts
around
the
country
is
controversial.
it's
subject
to
cross-examination.
the
--
the
--
we
haven't
resolved
whether
--
whether
the
state
of
that
--
the
state
of
that
--
the
state
of
that
evidence
yet.
but
having
said
that--
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
--
that
is
certainly
true
--
that
is
certainly
true
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
right.
and
there
--
and
there
is
no
doubt,
i
will
not
deny,
the
state's
case
will
be
easier
if
it
does
not
have
to
obtain
a
warrant,
but
this
case
--
court
has
recognized
that
many
times
in
the
past.
criminal
investigations
are
always
easier
if
the
state
does
not
have
to
comply
with
the
warrant
process.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
mm-hmm.
mr.
steven
r.
shapiro
well,
i
would
say
three
things,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
is
as
intrusive,
although
even
in
cupp
v.
murphy,
which
is
that
case,
the
court
described
it
as
a
serious
but
brief
intrusion
on
the
cherished
value
of
personal
security.
the
court
recognized
that
even
the
--
the
fingernail
scrape
was
--
was
a
serious
fourth
amendment
issue.
secondly,
that
evidence,
unlike
the
blood
alcohol
evidence,
was
under
the
control
of
the
defendant
and
in
that
case,
on
the
facts
of
that
case,
much
like
many
of
the
court's
other
exigent
circumstances
cases,
there
was
evidence
that
suggests
that
the
defendant
was
actively
engaged
in
the
process
of
degrading
the
evidence
at
the
time
that
the
police
stepped
in
and
said
we're
going
to
preserve
what
is
left
rather
than
allow
you
to
be
the
agent
of
your
own
destruction.
and
as
the
court
said
in
kentucky
v.
king,
it
is
a
very
different
situation
when
you
have
the
defendant
himself
destroying
evidence.
under
those
circumstances,
it
may
be
reasonable
for
the
court
to
say
you
can't
simultaneously
destroy
evidence
and
then
protest
that
the
destruction
of
the
evidence
--
evidence
has
created
the
exigency
that
requires
the
state
to
act
without
a
warrant.
but
there
is
no
agency
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
the
defendant
has
no
capacity.
and
i
come
back
to
what
i
said
before.
it
is
true,
i
think
this
question
came
--
came
up
earlier,
when
mr.
koester
was
being
--
was
being
questioned.
fourth
amendment
standards
are
not
determined
by
state
law.
the
court
has
said
that
in
virginia
v.
moore.
we
all
understand
that.
but
in
the
determination
of
what
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
this
court
has
often
looked
to
state
practices
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question.
in
tennessee
v.
garner,
you
have
the
court
say
half
the
states
have
abrogated
the
common
law
rule
that
would
have
allowed
the
police
to
shoot
any
fleeing
felon.
in
richards
v.
wisconsin,
you
have
half
the
states
that
not
support
an
exception
to
the
no
knock
rule.
here
we
have
half
the
states
in
the
country
that
would
not
have
permitted
what
went
on
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
