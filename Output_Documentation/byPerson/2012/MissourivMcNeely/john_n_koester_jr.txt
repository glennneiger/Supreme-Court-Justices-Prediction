mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
course
of
a
drunk
driving
investigation,
quickly
securing
blood
alcohol
evidence
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
is
incredibly
important--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
back
in
2003,
there
was
an
appellate
court
case
from
missouri
that
dealt
with
the
importance
of
the
words--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
--
that
ignores
the
fact
that
had
he
sought
a
warrant
--
there's
no
question
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
secure
a
warrant.
the
issue
was,
it
was
going
to
take
a
considerable
amount
of
time.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
but
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
going
to
take
90
minutes
to
2
hours
to
secure
the
warrant.
and
during
that
period
of
time,
the
most
probative
evidence
was
going
to
be
dissipating,
was
going--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
he
never
had
a
problem
securing
a
warrant,
but
there
was
a
delay;
and
that's
--
that's
the
difference.
we're
--
we're
looking
at
a
delay,
and
quickly
securing
blood
alcohol
evidence
is
important,
because
the
evidence
is
being
lost
at
a
significant
rate
with
every
minute
that
passes.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
well,
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
that
that
is
something
that
we
should
always
strive
for,
to
be
able
to
get
the
best
possible
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
the
--
the
touchstone
of
any
fourth
amendment
analysis
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
and
it's
reasonable--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--and,
justice
sotomayor,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
if
the
court
rules
in
our
favor,
i
think
the
end
result
will
be
more
people
will
agree
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test.
in
this
case
the
arresting
officer
gave
the
defendant
an
option
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test
and
when
he
clearly
told
him
he
was
not
going
to
take
it,
that's
when
he
decided
to
take
him
to
the
hospital
in
order
to
draw
the
blood.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
for
practical--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
both
tests
are
very
reliable.
we
rely
on
the
breathalyzer
test
on
a
daily
basis,
but
for
practical
reasons
it's
very
difficult
to
force
a
drunk
driver
to
take
a
breath
test.
the
breathalyzer
instruments,
they
measures
deep
lung
alveolar
air.
and
you
have
to
take
a
very
deep
breath.
and
one
police
officer
told
me
it's
sort
of
like
you
can
put
a
balloon
in
front
of
somebody's
mouth,
but
you
can't
make
him
blow
it
up.
it's
very
difficult
for
practical
reasons
to
force
someone
to
--
to
blow
into
the
breathalyzer.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
as
the
respondent
points
out,
there
are
25
states
that
would
be
opposed
to
--
to
the
warrantless
blood
draw
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
as
i
point
out
in
the
reply
brief,
15
of
those
states
have
joined
amicus
delaware
urging
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
missouri
supreme
court,
and
i
think--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
i
think,
as
virginia
v.
moore
plainly
teaches,
individual
state
laws
do
not
affect
whether
or
not
this
activity
was
reasonable
under
the
constitution.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
sampson
vs.
california
is
instructive.
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
approved
suspicion-less
searches
of
parolees,
and
i
think
a
vast
majority
of
states
disapproved
of
that
particular
law
enforcement
practice.
but
that
does
not
bear
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
that
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
i
suppose
that
is
a
possibility,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
amici
national
district
attorneys
association
cited
a
study.
i
know
the
respondent
also
cited
a
study
that
shows
it
doesn't
have
any
bearing.
but
i
think
it's
--
it's
pretty
clear
that
if
you
have
concrete
evidence
of
a
drunk
driver's
blood
alcohol
content,
concrete
evidence,
that
gives
you
a
far
greater
case,
a
far
greater
chance
of
securing
a
conviction
at
trial.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
no,
justice
sotomayor.
i
think
as
long
as
a
police
officer
has
probable
cause,
what
we're
saying
is
it's
objectively--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--you
are
absolutely
right,
justice
ginsburg,
probable
cause
is
not
enough.
but
probable
cause
coupled
with
the
indisputable
fact
that
alcohol
is
eliminated
from
the
human
body
with
every
minute
that
passes
after
a
drunk
driver
is
pulled
over--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--i
think
if
a
particular
jurisdiction
had
perfected
the
warrant
process
to
the
point
where
they
could
routinely
obtain
search
warrants
in
15
minutes,
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
outcome.
i
think
that
would
affect
the
analysis
of
the
case.
but
with
all
due
respect
to
the
hypothetical,
i
think
it
is
a
time-consuming
process
to
obtain
search
warrants.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
justice
breyer,
i
think
in
practical
application
it
is
going
to
be
more
of
a
time-consuming
process,
though,
to
obtain
the
search--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--to
obtain
a
search
warrant--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--well,
justice
breyer,
that's
why
i
drew
the
analogy
between
the
telephonic
search
warrants
that
were
approved
back
in
the
1970s.
it
sounds
like
that
would
be
an
instantaneous
procedure,
but
some
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
actually
examined
the
process,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
still
a
time
consuming
process--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
that
is
the
case
in
missouri.
the
prosecution
attorney--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
if
we
were
to
the
point
where
we
were
approving
search
warrants
in
3
minutes,
it
would
essentially
be
a
rubber
stamp--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--that
may
be
true,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
that's
a
difficult
question,
to
draw
a
bright
line
for
exactly
when
we
would
draw
the
line
where
--
where
the
exigency
would
disappear.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
well,
justice
sotomayor--
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
--of
course,
local
law
enforcement
practices
are
going
to
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
well,
i
think
prosecutors
are
always
going
to
strive
to
obtain
search
warrants
as
efficiently
as
possible.
but
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reasonable
search
does
not
depend
upon
local
police
practices.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
thank
you.
ms.
saharsky.
mr.
john
n.
koester,
jr.
thank
you.
everyone
agrees
that
the
closer
a
chemical
test
is
taken
to
the
time
of
driving,
the
more
reliable
the
evidence
of
intoxication
is,
the
more
reliable
the
evidence
of
impairment
is.
so
under
the
respondent's
approach,
it
would
be
mandated
that
we're
going
to
allow
the
most
reliable
evidence
to
dissipate
and
degrade
over
a
period
of
time
in
favor
of
admittedly
less
reliable
evidence
taken
at
a
later
time.
and
i
--
that's
simply
inconsistent
with
--
with
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
--
and
other
destruction
of
evidence
cases.
i
believe
the
respondent's
proposed
rule
here
is
completely
impractical
and
unworkable.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i--
