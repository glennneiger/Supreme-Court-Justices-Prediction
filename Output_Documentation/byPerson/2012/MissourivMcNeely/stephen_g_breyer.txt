justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
can't
you
do
that?
i
mean,
the
only
virtue
i
see
in
saying
you
have
to
go
get
a
warrant
is
the
officer
picks
up
the
phone,
there
is
usually
somebody
on
duty,
a
magistrate
somewhere,
he
phones
him
up
and
says:
i
have
a
drunk
driver
here;
he's
wobbling,
he
can't
cross
the
center
line;
and
he
won't
take
a
breathalyzer;
i
want
to
give
him
a
test.
now,
you
have
a
second
judgment
and
the
officer
has
to
talk
to
somebody,
so
he's
a
little
more
careful.
and
that's
a
protection,
not
necessarily
for
this
person,
but
a
protection
for
others
who
maybe
weren't
wobbling.
all
right.
so
i
think
that's
the
question
you're
being
asked.
why
--
what's
the
problem
with
doing
that?
which
adds
a
little
bit
of
security
that
this
warrant
really
is
--
this
search
is
really
necessary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
it
take
--
let's
see,
how
long
did
it
take
me
to
say
that?
it
took
me
about
30
seconds.
so
--
so
even
if
you
are
a
lot
more
careful,
why
would
it
take
more
than,
say,
3
minutes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
you
do
is
you
have
a
system,
and
you
phone
up
and
you
do
just
what
i
said.
and
this
man
or
woman
who
is
there
is
not
a
policeman.
the
virtue
of
it
is
this
man
or
woman
is
trained
to
listen
to
policemen
and
others
say
things
and
try
to
pin
him
down
a
little
bit
and
make
an
independent
judgment.
so
--
so
why
would
it
take
more
than
5
minutes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
question
was
if
--
if
in
fact
the
person
won't
agree
to
a
breathalyzer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
was
your
client
was
offered
the
breathalyzer
twice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
times?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
aside
from
all
--
the
thing,
what
it
boils
down
to,
at
least
in
my
mind,
is,
is
yes,
of
course
it
would
be
better
to
--
to
have
a
neutral
person
hear
what
the
policeman
has
to
say
and
to
act
as
a
second
judgment
on
that;
it
would
make
it
less
likely
that
people
who
are
really
innocent
in
fact
have
this
happen
to
them
and
so
forth.
but
they're
arguing
that
that's
a
--
that's
a
considerable
burden
in
many,
but
not
all
states.
and
at
some
point
--
and
the
addition
in
respect
to
the
second
judgment,
namely
the
magistrates
that
you
get,
is
not
worth
really
what
you're
going
to
lose,
which
are
going
to
be
people
who
are
drunk
driving
around
on
roads
and
--
and
possibly
killing
people.
we
all
know
how
that
side
can
be
built
up,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
at
some
point,
i
would
wish
you
would
spend
some
time
addressing
that,
that
practical
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
lot
of
states
have
varying
degrees
to
which
they
want
to
enforce
strict
rules
against
drunk
driving.
and
a
state
--
that's
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
worries
me
on
your
side.
the
--
you
have
a
bunch
of
states
that
don't
--
you
know,
it's
not
easy
to
get
hold
of
a
magistrate
in
15
minutes
or
so
forth.
and
so
what
to
do
about
that?
if
you
say,
well,
you
don't
have
to
because
you
haven't
got
it
provided,
you
give
them
every
incentive
not
to
make
the
magistrate
available.
that's
cutting
in
your
favor.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
pretty
tough
to
say
that
all
these
states
have
to
have
the
best
possible
magistrate
available
24
hours
a
day
so
somebody
can
call
in
ten
instances
a
year
because
the
guy
won't
take
the
blood
test
--
won't
take
the
breathalyzer.
that's
where
i
am
in
a
dilemma.
so
i'm
looking
for
an
answer
to
that.
and
you
don't
have
an
absolute
rule
or
i
don't
see
an
absolute
rule.
should
you
say,
look,
here's
what
you
have
to
do,
it's
better
to
have
a
second
opinion
there,
which
is
the
magistrate's?
and
so
on
the
way
to
the
hospital,
it's
just
that's
where
we
started,
you
have
to
phone
and
try
to
get
one,
and
if
you
don't
have
one
by
the
time
you're
at
the
hospital,
tell
them
again:
it's
your
last
chance,
give
us
the
breathalyzer
or
else.
and
if
he
says
no,
then
you
take
the
blood
test.
well,
that's
a
solution,
or
do
you
have
a
better
solution?
what's
the
solution
to
the
problem
if
you
are
willing
to
reject,
which
you
aren't,
but
hypothetically
you
might
be,
that
there's
the
absolute
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is
what
you
don't
want
to
do
and
you
don't
have
to,
but
if
you
think
of
a
second-best
solution
it
might
always
be
better
than
what
i
think
of
as
a
second-best
solution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
--
i
want
to
know
if
you
want
to
say
anything
that
would
suggest
--
we
have
a
number
of
them
floating
around
--
and
i
just
wonder
if
you
want
to
express
any
view
on
a
second-best
solution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
am
probably
just
--
but
a
policeman
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
somebody
inside
the
house
has
drugs.
he
hears
the
toilet
flushing
and
he
thinks
they're
flushing
the
drugs
down
the
drain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
doesn't
have
to
get
a
warrant
as
long
as
he
reasonably
believes
that
the
evidence
is
disappearing.
all
right.
now,
the
difference
between
your
case
here
and
that
is
specifically
what?
suppose
we
were
just
to
refer
to
those
cases--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
say
it's
the
same
thing.
