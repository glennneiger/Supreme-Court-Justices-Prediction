justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
jurisdictions
have
an
incentive
to
get
a
warrant,
i
would
think.
even
if
they
--
even
if
we
were
to
say
that
they
don't
need
one,
they
certainly
have
a
strong
incentive
to
get
warrants
because
it
insulates
the
search
to
a
much
greater
degree
from
later
challenge
at
a
suppression
hearing.
so
why
shouldn't
it
depend
on
the
practicalities
in
a
particular
jurisdiction?
not
every
jurisdiction
has
prosecutors
and
judges
who
are
staying
up
at,
you
know,
3:00
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
sunday
morning
waiting
for
the
phone
to
ring
or
for
--
to
receive
some
sort
of
an
electronic
message
that
there
has
been
a
stop
and
somebody
wants
a
--
wants
a
search
warrant.
maybe,
you
know,
big
jurisdictions
can
do
that,
but
small
ones
can't.
so
why
--
but
if
you
are
in
a
big
jurisdiction
that
--
or
one
that
feels
that
they
can
afford
that,
then
why
should
--
you
know,
why
should
the
fourth
amendment
permit
the
search
to
take
place
without
the
warrant
when
it
could
have
been
obtained--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
if
the
state
has
a
form;
we
have
forms
in
the
joint
appendix.
what
if
it
has
a
form
for
the
officer
to
fill
out?
he
checks
certain
boxes,
and
then
you
send
this
electronically
to
a
magistrate,
and
if
the
right
boxes
are
checked,
the
magistrate
will
grant
the
warrant.
is
that
--
do
you
think
that
is
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
suppose
you
are
in
a
rural
jurisdiction
and
it
takes
a
long
time
to
rouse
a
prosecutor
and
a
magistrate
at
3:00
in
the
morning
to
get
the
warrant.
you
would
say,
that's
too
bad,
everybody
has
--
the
whole
country
has
to
operate
like
new
york
city,
you
have
to
have
somebody
on
duty
all
the
time.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
i'm
asking
you
a
hypothetical
question.
i
bet
there
are
places
like
that.
i
have
encountered
magistrate
--
federal
magistrate
judges
who
were
unreceptive
to
receiving
warrant
applications
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
and
that
is
known
to
--
to
exist.
suppose
you
have
a
jurisdiction
like
that?
does
that
count
as
a
circumstance
that
would
justify
a
warrantless
taking
of
blood?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
that's
not
true,
because
there's
a
great
advantage
to
the
prosecution
in
having
a
search
with
a
warrant
as
opposed
to
a
warrantless
search
in
terms
of
suppression;
isn't
that
correct?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
how
much
blood
has
to
be
taken
in
order
to
test
for
blood
alcohol?
what
if
medical
technology
advances
to
--
i
gather
it's
a
--
it's
a
substantial
amount.
but
what
if
it
advances
to
the
point
that
you
don't
need
any
more
blood
than
you
need
now
to
test
blood
sugar,
and
you
just
have
a
little
machine
that
makes
a
tiny
prick
in
somebody's
finger
and
you've
got
enough
blood
to
do
a
blood
alcohol
test.
does
it
change
then?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
if
they
had
sent
more
police
officers
to
the
scene,
they
could
have
done
everything
faster.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
they
had
sent
more
police
officers
to
the
scene
of
the
accident,
if
they
--
then
they
could
have
done
it
faster.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
so
what's
the
difference
between
that
practical
limitation
and
the
limitation
that
exists
in
a
world
--
in
a
rural
jurisdiction?
