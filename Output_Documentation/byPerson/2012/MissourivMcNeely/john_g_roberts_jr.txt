chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
number
11-1425,
missouri
v.
mcneely.
mr.
koester.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
some
cases
i
suppose
the
judges
actually
want
to
read
the
affidavit
and
give
it
some
thought.
it's
not
going
to
be
3
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
members
of
the
court
have
intruded
on
your
rebuttal
time,
including
me,
so
we
will
give
you
a
little
extra.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can
finish
your
thought.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
a
breathalyzer,
do
you
need
a
warrant
for
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
know
what
missouri's
position
is,
and
i
know
it's
not
a
breathalyzer
test.
but
if
the
logic
of
your
position
leads
to
the
requirement
of
a
warrant
for
breathalyzer,
that
would
be
pertinent
in
analyzing
your
position.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
does
that
mean
--
the
last
footnote
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
talks
about
some
other
methods,
including
a
urine
sample.
not
as
accurate
as
blood,
but
it
can
help
achieve
the
same
result.
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
affects
the
view
in
this
case
is
it's
a
pretty
scary
image
of
somebody
restrained,
and,
you
know,
a
representative
of
the
state
approaching
them
with
a
needle.
but
i
take
it
you
would
say
you
need
a
search
warrant
for
a
urine
sample,
too?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
about
--
what
about
this
device
that
you
just
sort
of
hold
in
front
of
it,
you
don't
have
to
blow
up
the
balloon,
you
just
hold
it
in
front
of
the
individual
and
it
measures
to
some
extent
blood
alcohol
content,
or
at
least
whether
the
individual's
been
drinking?
surely
you
don't
need
a
search
warrant
for
that.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
in
an
odd
--
odd
position
to
be
making
--
it's
an
understandable
position
--
your
argument
is
these
warrants
are
just
easy
as
--
as
pie.
you
just
send
in
this
thing,
the
judge
does
it
in
an
instant,
it
doesn't
take
very
long
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
diminishes
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
a
far
--
far
greater
extent.
the
idea
is
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
supposed
to
spend
some
time
looking
at
this
before
submitting
it
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
is
supposed
to
spend
some
time
examining
it.
but
the
idea
that
you're
going
to
do
these
things
in
a
half
hour
seems
unreasonable
to
me.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'm
sorry,
what's
the
relevance
of
that?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
depends
upon
when
the
last
--
if
a
person
left
the
restaurant
right
after
they
had
a
nightcap
and
then
left,
but
if
they
just
had
drinks
before,
i
mean,
the
problem
seems
to
be
there
in
either
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
don't
know
when
the
person's
last
drink
was.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
koester,
you
have
--
we'll
give
you
three
minutes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
today
in
case
11-1425,
missouri
versus
mcneely.
