why
don't
you
force
him
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test,
instead
of
forcing
him
to
have
a
needle
shoved
in
his
--
in
his
arm?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
difference
between
the
reliability
or
the
acceptability
by
juries
of
a
breathalyzer
test
as
opposed
to
a
blood
draw?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
we
don't
know
why
they
disapproved.
and
i
guess
your
point
is
they
may
well
not
have
permitted
it
because
they
were
under
what
you
would
call
the
mistaken
belief
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
koester,
in
most
jurisdictions,
unless
i'm
mistaken,
the
cop
on
the
beat
cannot
apply
for
and
get
a
search
warrant.
he
has
to
go
through
a
prosecuting
attorney
or
someone
in
the
prosecutor's
office
first.
so
it's
not
just
getting
hold
of
a
judge.
it's
getting
hold
of
the
prosecutor
first
and
then
getting
hold
of
the
judge
if
the
prosecutor
approves
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
case
in
missouri?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
mean,
once
we
say
that
you
don't
need
a
warrant,
you
know,
even
if
things
improve,
the
game's
up,
right?
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
somebody
can
come
up
10
years
from
now
and
say,
although
you
approved
it
10
years
ago
without
a
warrant,
things
have
changed,
so
now
you
need
a
warrant?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
that's
the
case,
then
why
shouldn't
that
determination
be
made
case
by
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
case
by
case,
whether
in
fact
it
would
have
taken
that
long
to
get
a
warrant?
and
if
it
--
if
it
would
have
taken
too
long,
then
it's
okay
without
a
warrant.
if
it
wouldn't
have
taken
that
long,
it's
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
totality
of
the
circumstances
test,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
was
enough,
either,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel
for
missouri
tells
us,
ms.
saharsky,
that
the
breathalyzer
is
just
as
good
and
that
in
fact
he
expects
that
the
consequence
of
our
ruling
in
his
favor
in
this
case
will
be
that
drunken
drivers
will
agree
to
the
breathalyzer
test.
but
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
adequate
to
produce
that
result
simply
to
put
the
drunk
driver
in
a
--
in
a
paddy
wagon
and
on
the
way
to
the
hospital
say:
you
know,
we're
going
to
be
in
the
hospital
in
20
minutes;
we're
applying
for
a
warrant;
when
we
get
there,
we're
going
to
--
we're
going
to,
you
know,
stick
a
needle
in
your
arm,
unless,
of
course,
you
agree
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test.
why
isn't
that
enough
to
--
to
force
them
into
the
breathalyzer
test,
so
that
they
will
blow
up
the
balloon.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
a
lot
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing?
i
mean,
what
--
what
advantage
do
you
think
your
client
would
--
would
really
get
from
the
warrant
requirement
other
than
the
delay
that
that
would
entail
allowing
his
blood
alcohol
to
reduce
itself?
are
the
--
for
some
warrants,
let's
say
a
warrant
to
go
into
a
building
where
the
police
contend
there
may
be
drugs,
the
policeman
--
you
know,
the
magistrate
will
say,
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
there's
drugs?
well,
you
know,
two
weeks
ago
we
had
this
informer,
yesterday
we
saw
this
and
so,
you
know,
all
sorts
of
different
factors.
in
these
dui
cases
it's
always
going
to
be
the
same
thing.
the
policeman
is
going
to
say,
well,
you
know,
his
breath
smelled
of
alcohol;
we
gave
him
the
walk
a
straight
line
and
turn
around
test,
he
flunked
it;
he
couldn't
touch
his
nose
with
his
index
finger.
what
is
the
impartial
magistrate
possibly
going
to
do
except
to
say,
hey,
you
know,
that's
probable
cause.
are
any
of
these
warrants
ever
turned
down?
are
they
ever
turned
down
in
your
experience?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
bet
you
they're
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
many
of
them
there
is
a
lot
of
judgment
that
has
to
be
brought
to
bear:
is
this
a
reliable
informant,
how
long
ago
did
he
tell
you,
and
so
forth.
whereas,
in
all
of
these
cases
it's
going
to
be
the
same
thing:
his
breath
smelled
of
alcohol,
he
couldn't
walk
a
straight
line,
and
whatnot.
and
that's
the
probable
cause.
and
i
don't
see
how
the
independent
magistrate
is
going
to
do
you
a
whole
lot
of
good,
except
for
the
fact
that
it
will
delay
the
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
bears
considerably
on
the
reasonableness,
doesn't
it?
i
don't
know
why
you
want
to
bite
off
more
than
you
can
chew.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
different
case
and
what
is
reasonable
for
sticking
a
needle
in
your
arm
is
not
necessarily
reasonable
for
asking
you
to
blow
up
a
balloon.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
--
i
thought
you
would
also
distinguish
the
drug
flush
cases
on
--
on
the
ground
that
violation
of
the
integrity
of
your
home
is
somewhat
less
than
violation
of
the
integrity
of
your
body.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
goes
into
the
reasonableness
determination.
