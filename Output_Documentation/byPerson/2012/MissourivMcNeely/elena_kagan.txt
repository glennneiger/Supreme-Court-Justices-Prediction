mr.
koester,
suppose
that,
instead
of
waiting
2
hours,
there
were
procedures
in
place
in
missouri
and,
indeed,
across
the
country
where
it
was
possible
to
get
a
warrant
in
these
circumstances
within
15
or
20
minutes.
would
you
still
be
saying
that
there
is
a
sufficient
exigency
to
avoid
the
warrant
requirement?
justice
elena
kagan
you
suggest
that
15
or
20
would
be
a
different
case.
i
am
wondering
where
you
would
draw
the
bright
line.
justice
elena
kagan
or
maybe
they're
drunk.
but,
but,
but
--
i
mean,
justice
scalia
raises
a
point,
which
is
you
always
have
some
delay.
unless
you
are
talking
about
sticking
a
needle
in
somebody
roadside,
you
have
to
take
them
to
the
hospital.
so
there's
going
to
be
some
amount
of
time
which
you're
going
to
lose,
and
why
can't
you
use
that
amount
of
time,
if
you
can,
to
try
to
get
a
warrant?
justice
elena
kagan
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
if
a
person
does
take
a
breathalyzer,
is
there
ever
a
reason
for
a
warrantless
blood
test?
justice
elena
kagan
all
this
talk
about,
you
know,
losing
evidence
every
second,
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
exact
same
thing
could
be
said
in
other
alcohol-related
crimes,
public
drunkenness,
underage
drinking.
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
same
arguments
there,
would
you?
or
would
you?
justice
elena
kagan
so
it's
not
just
exigency
that
you're
--
you're
saying
that
there
should
be
a
weighing
of
the
costs
and
benefits
here.
justice
elena
kagan
that's
a
separate
question,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
one
prong
of
your
argument
is
you
need
individualized
circumstances,
you
can't
have
a
per
se
rule.
and
now
this
other
set
of
questions
about
what
you
get
to
count
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test;
is
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
so
one
could
disagree
with
you
and
one
could
think,
as
justice
alito
and
justice
kennedy
suggested,
you
know,
you
do
take
into
account
that
it's
the
middle
of
the
night
in
a
rural
county
and
it's
going
to
take
two
hours,
but
still
think,
well,
that's
the
analysis
you
had
to
go
through.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
shapiro,
schmerber
is
an
odd
case,
because
justice
ginsburg
are
exactly
right,
that
they
spend
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
special
facts,
and
particularly
so,
but
then
you
read
the
opinion
kind
of
backwards
and
forwards,
and
you
can't
find
the
special
facts.
