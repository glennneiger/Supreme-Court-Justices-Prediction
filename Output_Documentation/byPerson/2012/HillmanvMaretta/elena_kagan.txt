but
i
guess
the
question,
mr.
johnson,
is
whether
we
just
got
it
wrong
there.
because
if
you
look
at
this
statute,
it
seems
--
you
know,
if
you
were
just
doing
it
as
a
matter
of
first
impression,
that
what
congress
wanted
was
a
clear
and
uniform
rule
to
allow
it
to
pay
benefits
quickly
and
easily
without
any
discussion
or
investigation
of
a
person's
true
intent.
but
that
after
that,
why
does
congress
have
an
interest
any
further?
and
if
a
state
has
a
law
that
says,
really,
we
think
the
better
measure
of
intent
is
something
else,
then
we
should
let
the
states
go
ahead
with
their
law.
