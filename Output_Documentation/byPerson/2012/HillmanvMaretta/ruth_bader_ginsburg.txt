but
it's
written
--
but
it's
written
in
such
precise
terms,
it
must
be
incorporated
in
a
divorce
decree,
and
the
decree
must
be
filed
with
the
employee
agency
pre-death.
what
you're
saying
is
this
specific
exception,
rightly
cabined,
is
generalized
so
that
in
all
cases,
the
second
wife
will
prevail
over
the
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
it
be
different
than
the
outcome
in
wissner
and
ridgway
and
one
--
one
case
that
you
cite
quite
often
is
the
hisquierdo
case
for
--
you
--
you
cite
it
for
deference
to
state
domestic
relations
law,
but
what
was
the
outcome
in
that
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
--
what
was
the
issue?
what
was
the
issue
in
rose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
they
were
taking
them
from
him
to
support
his
family.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
quite
something
different.
this
is
taking
it
from
the
designated
beneficiary
and
giving
it
to
somebody
who
isn't
designated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ruttenberg,
how
do
you
get
to
this
notion
that
administrative
convenience
is
all
that
is
involved?
after
all,
this
is
an
employee's
life
insurance
and
the
government
is
saying
to
the
employee:
the
beneficiary
is
your
free
choice;
you
can
pick
anyone,
your
spouse,
a
charity;
it's
your
choice;
but
we
want
you
to
know
that,
although
you
make
it
and
you
can
change
it
any
time
you
want,
if
you
don't
change
it
that
will
be
it.
that
--
so
it's
giving,
the
employee,
control
over
the
proceeds
of
his
or
her
life
insurance.
why
isn't
that
a
purpose
along
with
administrative
convenience?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
would
agree
with
that?
i
assume
you
would
agree
with
what
justice
alito
just
said?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
it
has
only
to
do
with
administrative
convenience?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
this
scheme
be
treated
differently
than
the
national
service
life
insurance
and
the
successor
law
in
wissner
and
ridgway?
those
operated
the
same
way.
they
said
the
person
who
designates
says
who
gets
it
and
if
you
--
the
only
way
you
can
change
it
is
to
have
a
change
of
beneficiary
form
filed
with
your
employer;
if
you
don't
do
that,
whatever
you've
said
is
where
the
money
goes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
two
decisions
that
dealt
with
the
anti-attachment,
they
gave
that
as
an
alternative
ground
of
decision.
it
was
quite
separate
and
discrete
from
saying
what's
on
the
beneficiary,
the
designation
that
controls.
and
they
say,
and
also
there's
this
anti-attachment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
--
in
your
briefs
in
this
case,
you
put
in
the
assignment
provision
as
--
as
an
afterthought.
i
think
you
did
not
put
it
in
your
main
brief.
it
came
up
only
in
your
reply
brief,
and
you
didn't
put
it
in
the
appendix
to
your
main
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
--
you
seem
to
assign
lesser
importance
to
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ruttenberg,
what
about
the
interest,
which
was
an
interest
in
wissner
and
in
ridgway,
of
uniformity
under
this
federal
insurance
scheme?
that
is,
one
of
the
hypotheticals
in
the
briefs
was:
the
deceased
dies
domiciled
in
virginia.
wife
no.
1
comes
from
x
state,
not
virginia,
wife
no.
2
two
from
y
state,
and
they
all
have
different
--
different
rules.
the
employee,
in
the
course
of
her
career,
may
move
around
from
here
or
there.
but
if
you
follow
the
federal
law,
then
it's
going
to
be
the
same
for
every
employee.
these
are
the
rules
for
every
employee
no
matter
where
he
or
she
lives,
no
matter
the
location
of
the
spouse.
and
then
we
don't
have
these
messy
problems
with
choice
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
johnson,
that
--
that
is
in
the
opm
manual,
but
i
think
mr.
ruttenberg
pointed
out
that
it's
106-some-odd
pages.
how
are
employees
covered
by
this
insurance,
how
are
they
informed
about
what
the
beneficiary
designation
means?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
johnson,
there
are
at
least
one
case
where
the
state
law
would
override
the
beneficiary
designation
and
that's
obviously
if
the
beneficiary
murdered
the
--
the
insured.
so
how
does
this
scheme
to
displace
the
beneficiary
designated
in
the
policy
in
the
slayer
case
requires
state
law?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
get
there
by
a
federal
common
law
rule,
but
then
who
would
get
the
proceeds?
if
the
designated
beneficiary
is
out
because
of
the
federal
common
law
that
excludes
a
slayer,
where
would
you
go
next?
you'd
go
to
state
law,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
next
one
is
--
it
would
be--
