mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
intentionally
designed
feglia
so
that
the
federal
interest
ends
once
the
insurance
proceeds
are
paid
out.
feglia
was
established
to
enable
federal
employees
to
carry
out
their
responsibilities
to
their
families.
and
congress
knew
that
some
of
its
employees
would
get
divorced,
and
it
was
depending
upon
state
laws
to
help
make
sure
that
these
family
duties
and
obligations
were
carried
out,
because
congress
doesn't
want
to
get
into
the
--
the
business
of
regulating
the
divorce.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
justice--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
justice
scalia,
because
congress
knew
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
behind
feglia
was
to
help
the
insureds
or
enable
the
insureds
to
carry
out
responsibilities
to
their
families.
and
that
is
a
mechanism
to
help
do
that,
but
it
wasn't--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--justice
ginsburg,
i
believe
that
the
requirements
that
it
get
filed
in
--
it
being
a
divorce
decree
and
it
get
filed
before
death,
are
an
example
of
congress
intending
to
preempt
the
field
of
interference
with
the
fegli
plan.
it
--
congress
did
this
in
several
occasions.
if
you
wanted
to
do
a
beneficiary
designation,
you
have
to
do
it
before
--
in
order
for
it
to
be
honored,
it's
got
to
be
filed
before
death.
the
same
thing
with
an
assignment.
an
irrevocable
assignment
has
to
be
done
before
death.
these
are
all
examples
of
congress
saying
we
don't
want
states
interfering
with
the
administration
of
feglia
plans,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
a
statement
that
congress
is
saying
we
don't
want
states
to
regulate
domestic
relations
when
it
comes
to
fegli
benefits.
the
--
the
intent
of
congress
with
regard
to
fegli
benefits
needs
to
be
gained
from
a
review
of
the
entire
statute
of
feglia.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
the
outcome
in
that
case
was
the
preemption
prevailed
in
that
case.
i
--
i
was
citing
the
--
the
case
of
hisquierdo
because
i
think
it
very
well
lays
out
the
presumption
against
preemption
of
family
law.
and
--
and
while
that
presumption
can
be
overcome,
as
it
was
in
ridgway,
and
as
it
was
in
hisquierdo,
it
--
it
still
is
there.
and
it's
--
it's
a
statement
that
congress
generally
is
not
looking
to
regulate
divorce.
not
that
congress
can't
do
it
when
it
wants
to,
but
that
this
court
normally
starts
its
analysis
assuming
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
do
that,
unless
they
find
direct
--
a
direct
enactment
saying
this
is
--
we
want
to
preempt
all
other
state
laws.
that
--
that
was
the
--
the
purpose
behind
citing
hisquierdo.
but
to
answer
your
first
question--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--well,
the
exception
for
divorce
decrees
i
would
analogize
to
the
rose
case,
when
this
case
was
--
when
this
court
was
addressing
veterans'
benefits.
and
in
the
rose
case,
this
court
distinguished
ridgway
and
wissner,
because
the
purpose
behind
the
veterans'
benefits
statute
this
court
determined
was
in
part
to
take
care
of
the
veterans'
families
and
it
looked
at
--
it
looked
at
the
text.
it
looked
at
the
senate
report
that
said
that,
but
it
also
looked
at
the
text.
and
the
text
had
in
rose
a
--
a
provision
which
said
the
veterans
administration
can
apportion
a
part
of
those
benefits
for
the
benefit
of
the
noncustodial
children.
and
it
was
argued
in
that
case
that
that's
congress's
statement
that
this
is
the
only
exception
and
further
exceptions
shouldn't
be
applied
and
congress
was
trying
to
regulate
this
area.
but
this
court
said
that's
not
what
congress
was
doing
there.
that
was
congress
showing
that
they
cared
about
--
that
those
benefits
were
there
to
help
take
care
of
the
family
members.
and
feglia
is
the
same
way.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
in
rose,
there
was
veterans'
benefits
and
those
--
he
was
being
sued
in
state
court
for
enforcement
of
child
support
and
those
were
his
only
assets.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
correct.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
purpose,
the
stated
purpose
of
feglia,
which
is
to
help
insureds
carry
out
their
responsibilities
to
their
families--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--i
think
that--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
i
think
what
congress
was
doing
is
congress
was
making
a
statement
--
i
don't
think
they
were
trying
to
say
they
were
looking
at
this
divorce
law
in
particular.
i
think
what
congress
was
saying
is
that:
we're
just
going
to
look
to
the
states
and
let
the
states
use
their
benefit
and
wisdom
to
determine
which
divorce
laws
should
apply
and
which
shouldn't
apply.
so
that
in
this
case
in
particular,
there
--
there
are
benefits
and
detriments
possibly
to
section
d,
but
what
this
court
i
think
would
be
appropriate
to
do
would
to
--
to
pass
a
bright-line
rule
that
said
state
laws
that
interfere
with
the
administration
of
a
plan
are
preempted,
but
after
that,
after
the
money
has
been
paid
out,
laws
that
affect
the
benefits
are
not
preempted,
and
that
--
that
allows
the
states
to
be--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--justice
kennedy,
it's
not
the
purpose
of
the
preemption.
section
d
was
a
response
to
this
court's
opinion
in
egelhoff.
and
at
first
blush
it
looks
like,
especially
with
the
language,
that
that's
what
the
states
are
trying
to
do,
trying
to
end
run
preemption.
but
that
--
when
you
look
at
it
closely,
that's
not
what
was
going
on.
in
--
in
egelhoff,
this
court
found
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
a
washington
statute
very
similar
to
section
a,
but
what
congress
was
preempting
was
a
state
interfering
with
the
administration
of
the
plan.
it
wasn't
preempting
a
state
domestic
relations
equitable
remedy
designed
to
protect
the
people
to
whom
the
federal
employee
owed
a
duty
of
support.
it
wasn't
that
--
that
the
states
were
not
listening
to
congress
or
this
court,
and
they're
not
sticking
their
fingers
in
their
ears
going
la,
la,
la,
i
can't
hear
you.
a
good
example
of
this
would
be
if
a
state
had
a
estimated
tax
payment
law
that
said
when
you
get
insurance,
you've
got
to
pay
10
percent
into
the
court
or
into
the
state,
that
wouldn't
be
preempted.
but
if
the
state
thereafter
had
a
law,
enacted
a
law
that
said
we
want
a
withholding
requirement
and
if
that
money
is
withheld
then
you
don't
have
to
do
the
estimated
tax
payment,
well,
that
would
clearly
be
preempted
because
it
interferes
with
the
administration
of
the
plan.
but
the
first
law
would
still
be
fine.
it
shouldn't
per
se
be
preempted
because
it
enacted
the
second
law
that
is
preempted
because
it's
interfering
with
the
administration--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--well,
they're
--
they're
not
going
to
have
to
check
unless
it's
been
properly
filed,
but--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--yes,
yes.
but
the
federal
government
has
no
--
it
--
there
is
no
interest
that
the
federal
government
would
have
in
saying
that
a
divorce
decree
that
was
properly
filed
has
--
should
be
--
should
be
honored,
but
one
that
hasn't
been
properly
filed
shouldn't
be.
they
want
state
laws
there.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
justice
kennedy,
that's
the
--
the
whole
point,
is
that
the
insurance
company
isn't--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--that's
the
design
of
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
not
at
all.
the
statute's
specifically
written
so
that
the
former
spouse
becomes
personally
liable
to
the
widow
or
whoever
was
entitled
to
it.
it's
designed
to
make
the--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--i
think
this
court
can
establish
the
--
i
think
they
have
established
under
the
kennedy
case
that
they
have
a
duty
to
pay
the
designated
beneficiary.
in
kennedy,
with
regards
to
erisa
and
whether
or
--
it
was
very
clear
that
the
insurance
--
the
plan
administrator
has
to
pay.
so
i
think
that
there
is
no
concern
at
all
for
the
insurance
company.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
i
believe
that
the.
purpose
of
feglia
was
--
the
other
main
stated
purpose
was
that
congress
was
trying
to
offer
life
insurance
similar
to
what
was
being
offered
by
private
companies,
and
they're
acting
as
an
employer
in
this
regard.
and
just
like
with
private
group
life
insurance,
most
people
think
that
the
beneficiary
designations
are
going
to
control
where
that
money
goes
and
--
and
the
same
with
feglia.
but
also,
most
everyone
expects
when
they
get
divorced
that
their
assets
are
going
to
be
subject
to
state
divorce
law.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
congress
wasn't
concerned
with
employees
carrying
out
their
responsibilities
to
their
families.
i'm
suggesting
congress
is
using
the
state
law.
congress
doesn't
want
to
be
the
one
that
makes
sure
that
those
responsibilities
are
carried
out.
they're
relying
on
state
law
and
they've
developed
a
scheme
that
allows
state
law
to
help
make
sure
those
duties
are
carried
out.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
well,
justice
alito,
after
the
money
has
been
paid
out
in
a
case
like
that,
it
is
possible
that
there
are
state
laws
involved
that
--
that
would
allow
someone
to
have
a
suit,
institute
a
suit
against
who
received
that.
but
congress
doesn't
want
opm
or
metlife
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that.
they
just
want
opm
and
metlife
to
be
able
to
do
the
job
of
paying
out.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
i
don't
think
feglia
says
that.
what
it
says
is--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--yes.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
well,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
it
has
only
to
do
with
that.
that's
one
of
the
--
the
--
that's
the
reason,
though,
that
everything
ends
once
the
benefits
are
paid
out.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
there's
--
there's
a
--
you
have
to
compare
the
feglia
and
the
sglia
to
get
the
intent
of
congress.
you
want
to
--
this
court
should
look
at
the
text
of
feglia
and
it
should
look
at
the
legislative
history,
and
there's
five
main
differences
i
can
point
to
which
suggest
that
congress
intended
something
different.
the
first
is
that
feglia
doesn't
have
an
anti-attachment
provision.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
absolutely,
your
honor.
but
when
it
did
the
holding
regarding
the
order
of
precedence,
it
didn't
just
look
at
the
order
of
precedence.
it
looked
at
all
of
sglia
and
it
looked
at
the
differing
provisions,
and
one
of
the
provisions
i
think
that
indicates
congress's
intent
in
sglia
is
the
anti-attachment
provision.
so
if
the
second
holding
was
not
there
at
all
with
regards
strictly
to
the
anti-attachment
provision,
ridgway
still
would
have
held
the
way
it
held
because
it
was
looking
at
all
of
sglia.
but
that's
not
the
only
difference.
there's
also
the
divorce
provision
which
they
have
in
federal
group
life
insurance
and
they
--
they
didn't
put
that
into
the
servicemen's
group
life.
they
let
feglia
people
assign
their
benefits.
there's
a
limited
express
preemption
provision
in
feglia
which
they
didn't
feel
was
needed
in
sglia.
and
when
you--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
i
do
assign
less
importance
to
the
assignment
provision
than
i
would
to
the
--
the
lack
of
an
anti-attachment
provision
or
the
--
the
divorce
provision
or
the
express
preemption
provision
or
even
the
legislative
history.
but
i
do
still
think
that
it
is
a
factor
to
be
looked
at.
and
in
this
case,
again
pointing
to
the
rose
case,
in
the
rose
case,
they
were
dealing
with
the
same
anti-attachment
provision
in
rose
and
even
there
determined
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
those
dollars
should
be
kept
away
from
the
--
the
family
members
in
that
case.
so
i
would
again
analogize
that
to
this
case,
because
in
the
rose
case,
they
specifically
distinguished
those
two
cases
on
those
grounds.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
there
--
there
are
two
--
two
points
i'd
like
to
make
there.
one,
i
don't
think
congress
was
trying
to
get
involved
in
the
field
of
divorce.
i
don't
think
congress
with
that
law
was
saying
all
other
domestic
relations
laws
don't
apply,
we
only
want
to
apply
these
laws.
there's
so
many
other
domestic
relations
laws
like
community
property
rights
and
waivers.
and
children
even
in
these
divorce
decrease
can't
file
it,
and
then
children
would
lose
out
if
their
parents
didn't
know
enough
to
file
those
things.
so,
the
first
point
is
that
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
there
with
that
provision.
and
the
second
point
is
that
it's
not
a
superfluous
provision.
if
i
had
a
divorce
decree,
i
would
much
rather
file
it
with
the
court
so
that
i
knew
it
would
get
paid
directly
to
me
than
have
to
deal
with
it
after
it's
been
paid
out.
so
i
think
it
is
--
it
absolutely
serves
a
purpose,
but
it
doesn't
serve
the
purpose
of
trying
to
--
to
get
--
i
think
congress
was
trying
to
make
a
statement,
we
want
these
benefits
to
be
subject
to
state
laws,
not
that
we
want
these
benefits--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--i
believe
that's
basically
what
they
did,
because
the
other
type
of
court
orders
such
as
a
waiver
wouldn't
make
sense
to
put
in
there.
you
--
you
would
not
--
if
i
was
paying
attention
if
i
--
if
i
had
filed
--
if
i
had
a
divorce
decree
that
said
my
ex-wife
waived
a
right
to
my
insurance,
it
doesn't
make
sense
that
i'd
do
that
additional
filing
because
that
wouldn't
add
anything
to
it.
so
congress
was
saying
that
court
orders
can
--
that
direct
where
money
goes
does
that.
and
the
other
types
of
laws,
like
community
property
laws
or
waivers
or
this
type
of
law,
they
would
have
to
have
a
separate
section
for
each
of
them
to
draft
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
wouldn't
interfere
--
it
would
make
it
easy
on
opm
to
know
where
to
pay
the
money.
and
i
think
what
they
were
doing
is
they
weren't
saying
any
types
of
state
laws
can
come
in,
because
they
didn't
--
they
wanted
to
deal
with
the
ones
that
were
clear,
that
were
easy
for
them
to
deal
with,
so
that
they
--
so
that
opm
and
metlife
knows
where
to
pay
the
money.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
congress
was
definitely
concerned
with
--
and
--
and
as,
again,
i
keep
referring
to
the
rose
case
because
i
think
it
worded
it
well
--
it
was
concerned
with
the
uniformity
of
the
administration
of
the
policy.
and
they
wanted
opm
and
metlife
to
uniformly,
no
matter
where
anyone
lived,
be
able
to
pay
those
out.
but
just
like
a
private
employee,
people
expect
their
assets
to
be
subject
to
divorce
laws
after
they're
paid
out.
and
opm
is
not
involved
in
anything
messy,
metlife
is
not
involved
in
anything
messy
after
it's
paid
out.
they're
treating
them
just
like
any
other
employee
in
a
private
company.
and
--
and
congress
stated
that
the
purpose,
the
other
--
there
are
two
main
purposes.
the
other
main
purpose
of
feglia
was
to
create
an
insurance
plan
that
was
on
par
with,
not
the
special
kind
of
insurance
that
we're
offering
to
servicemen.
congress
with
servicemen's
group
life
took
out
a
magic
wand
and
said,
we're
going
to
make
these
insurance
proceeds
special,
and
gave
special
characteristic
--
characteristics
to
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
proceeds.
but
they
did
not
do
that
--
well,
the
reason
they
did
that
with
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
is
because
they
wanted
servicemen,
no
matter
how
much
they
messed
up
their
finances,
to
know
that
they
could
leave
some
asset
to
whoever
they
wanted
to
regardless
of--
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
--the
--
the
first
reason
is
because
i
don't
think
they
wanted
to
try
and
come
up
with
every
permutation
of
divorce
law.
the
second
reason,
you
--
you
characterize
this
as
a
--
a
“
sick
law
”,
but
48
states
incorporate
laws
which
have
this
concept.
they
say:
in
your
will,
reference
to
your
former
spouse
are
deemed
--
they
just
haven't
because
the
nature
of
asset
transfers
in
probate
has
developed
over
time
--
not
all
the
states
have
caught
up;
only
18
have.
but
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
h.
ruttenberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
a
quick
point
about
the
--
the
fegli
handbook.
the
fegli
handbook
came
out
in
july
2008.
warren
hillman
died
in
july
2008.
so
what
the
fegli
handbook
said
--
i
don't
know
that
it
applies
in
this
case.
but
even
if
it
did,
what
it
says
is
a
recitation
of
the
egelhoff
holding.
all
it
says
is:
"a
divorce
does
not
invalidate
a
designation
that
means
your
former
spouse
is
a
beneficiary.
"
it
says
nothing
about
domestic
relations
laws
not
applying
after
that,
and
that's
exactly
what
--
this
court
found
in
egelhoff.
another
--
another
point
that
my
friend
made
was
with
regard
to
servicemen's
group
life
insurance
and
the
holding
in
ridgway
was
based
on
the
fact
that
these
insurance
proceeds
belong
to
the
designated
beneficiary
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others.
that
was
one
of
the
main
purposes
this
court
depended
upon
in
ruling
that
the
--
the
state
law
was
preempted.
and
you
can't
say
that
in
this
case,
because
those
proceeds
can
belong
to
--
there's
express
enactments
which
allow
to
you
assign
it,
and
allow
a
federal
--
a
divorce
decree
to
direct
where
those
go.
so
it
can't
be
said
in
--
with
feglia
that
those
proceeds
belong
to
the
designated
beneficiary
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others.
and
the
example
that
mr.
chief
justice
gave
with
regard
to
bankruptcy,
the
--
in
the
case
of
a
bankruptcy,
that's
not
benefiting
the
designated
beneficiary
because
all
their
debts
are
being
discharged
anyways.
so
in
that
situation,
it's
solely
benefiting
the
creditors.
i
also
wanted
to
address
one
of
justice
scalia's
comments.
justice
scalia
was
suggesting
that
this
is
not
a
divorce
law
and
is
not
subject
to
the
preemption.
but
the
preemption
analysis
with
regards
--
there
were
i
think
two
reasons
he
suggested
that.
one
was
it's
a
federal
act,
and
they
applied
in
ridgway,
which
was
dealing
with
the
federal
act,
the
servicemen's
group
life
insurance,
they
did
apply
the
preemption
analysis
there.
it
was
overcome,
but
they
applied
it.
and
this
court's
case
in
egelhoff
also
recognized
that
the
statute,
very
similar
section
a,
the
washington
version
of
section
a,
was
a
divorce/probate
type
of
law,
both
of
which
are
historical
police
powers.
the
--
the
only
other
comment
i
would
like
to
make
is
with
regard
to
the
slayer
statutes.
many
state
slayer
statutes
are
drafted
with
the
identical
language
of
section
d,
which
says
if
preempted
then
there
can
be
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
they're
--
they're
based
on
the
same
uniform
code,
and
they
use
the
same
language.
and
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
just
would
like
to
say
what
an
honor
it's
been
today
and
cede
the
rest
of
my
time.
