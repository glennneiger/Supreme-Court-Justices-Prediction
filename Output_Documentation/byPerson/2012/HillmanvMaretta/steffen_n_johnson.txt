mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
two
separate
occasions,
this
court
has
held
that
order
of
precedence
provisions
like
those
found
in
feglia
grant
the
insured
an
absolute
personal
right
to,
quote,
"direct
that
the
proceeds
belong
to
the
named
beneficiary
and
no
other.
"
in
fact,
congress
enacted
feglia
just
4
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
wissner,
where
this
court
held
that
the
misla
order
of
precedence
was
the
controlling
section
of
the
act,
was
forceful
and
clear
in
defining
the
scope
of
this
federal
right,
preempted
post-distribution
efforts
to
nullify
the
insured's
choice,
quote,
"whether
directed
at
the
very
money
it
received
from
the
government
or
an
equivalent
amount.
"
and
ridgway,
of
course,
extended
wissner
to
sglia,
which
contained
the
very
same
text
at
issue
here.
now,
for
a
number
of
reasons
we
think
that
this
case
is
even
easier
than
wissner
and
ridgway.
first
of
all,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
generally
applicable
body
of
law;
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
is
quite
openly
an
attempt
to
do
an
end
run
on
preemption.
the
only
thing
that
triggers
section
d
is
being
a
former
spouse
and
receiving
the
proceeds.
the
statute
doesn't
make
any
inquiry
into
intent,
into
whether
there
has
been
a
tort
or
an
independent
contract.
it
simply
reallocates
the
proceeds.
it
substitutes
a
new
beneficiary.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
it
--
it
might,
your
honor.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
well,
congress--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--well,
one
reason,
your
honor,
is
8705(e).
congress
has
spoken
specifically
to
the
question
of
divorce
in
this
context,
and
i
think,
as
justice
scalia's
and
justice
sotomayor's
questions
indicate,
it
didn't
simply
say
that
the
existence
of
a
decree
or
the
fact
of
divorce
would
result
in
a
change
in
who
receives
the
proceeds.
it
said
a
very
specific
type
of
divorce
decree
would
change
the
result.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
your
honor,
there
is
certainly
elements
of
administrative
convenience
in
the
statute.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
it
was
trying
to
provide
a
benefit
to
federal
employees,
and
that
benefit
was
to
be
able
to
provide
benefits,
life
insurance
proceeds,
to
the
person
of
their
choice.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
in
the
case
of--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--in
the
case
of
a
will,
your
honor,
8705(a)
makes
specific
provision
for
the
filing
of
a
will
with
the
employing
officer,
opm.
and
so
congress
has
taken
account
of
wills
and
it's
rejected
the
idea
of
just
a
free-floating
inquiry
into
intent.
there
were
--
i
should
add
that
the
will
language
of
8705(a)
was
added
to
the
statute
in
1966.
there
had
been
some
lower
court
cases
that
had
sort
of
taken
this
approach
to
wills
contrary
to
the
regulations
that
existed
that
said
the
designated
beneficiary
provision
should
govern.
congress
rejected
a
free-floating
inquiry
into
intent.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
congress
wanted
a
simple
rule,
and
it
determined
that
the
best
evidence
of
intent
is
the
actual
naming
of
the
beneficiary.
section
d
doesn't
make--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--well,
i
think
you
can
debate
what
the
better
policy
default
is,
but
when
you
have
a
long-standing
policy
that
says
to
federal
employees,
this
is
what
we
take
account
of
and
we
give
top
--
top
billing,
top
priority
to
the
naming
of
the
beneficiary--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--the
simplest
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
form
itself.
it's
form
sf-2823.
this
form
says:
"keep
your
designation
current.
"
"submit
a
new
one
if
your
intentions
change,
for
example,
due
to
a
change
in
family
status
such
as
marriage,
divorce,
etcetera.
"
so
it's
not
simply
the
opm
handbook.
it's
the
form
itself.
and
this
form
is
publicly
available,
of
course,
on
--
on
opm's
website,
but
also
was
substantially
the
same
and
contained
this
language
at
the
time
of
warren
hillman's
designation
in
this
case.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
and
of
course
there
is
an--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--well
--
well,
it
is
true
that
if
you
open
the
door
you'll
have
this
be
problem.
congress
wanted
a
clear,
simple,
and
certain
rule,
and
--
and
it
spoke
both
to
the
issues
of
wills
in
8705(a)
and
to
the
issues
of
divorce
decrees
in
8705(e).
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
i
think
that's
part
of
what
was
involved
here.
i
think
--
i
think
they
wanted
to
ensure
uniformity
for
federal
employees
who
might
work
in
different
jurisdictions
or
move
around.
i
think,
you
know,
you
have
a
situation
where
wills
are
addressed
in
the
statute,
divorce
decrees
are
addressed
in
the
statute,
and
i
would
note
that
section
d
does
not
make
any
inquiry
into
intent.
it's
simply
--
it's
just
an
automatic
blunt
rule
that
the
divorce
itself
has
the
effect
of
rerouting
the
proceeds.
this
court
has
taken
a
very
practical
and
realistic
approach
to
issues
of
preemption
in
a
--
in
a
wide
variety
of
context,
just
this
term
in
the
wos
case,
we
said,
the
court
said,
that
--
that
it's
not
simply
a
matter
of
semantics.
in
free
v.
bland,
one
of
this
court's
precedents
involving
u.s.
savings
bonds,
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
husband
of
the
decedent,
who
had
an
absolute
right
of
survivorship
under
federal
laws
governing
the
u.s.
savings
bond,
and
a
son
who
would
have
taken
under
a
will,
and
the
--
the
texas
supreme
court,
as
the
case
came
to
it,
said:
we
can
simply
honor
title
by
saying,
yes,
the
husband
does
have
an
absolute
right
of
survivorship,
but
we'll
order
the
husband
to
reimburse
the
--
the
estate.
and
this
is
what
this
court
said
in
reversing:
"viewed
realistically,
the
state
has
rendered
the
award
of
title
meaningless.
"
"if
the
state
can
frustrate
the
party's
attempt
to
use
the
bond's
survivorship
provision
through
the
simple
expedient
of
requiring
the
survivor
to
reimburse
the
estate,
the
state
has
interfered
directly
with
the
legitimate
exercise
of
the
power
of
the
federal
government.
"
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
if
the
question
is
whether
it's
possible
to
comply
with
the
mandate
to
pay
the
named
beneficiary--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--in
--
in
many
cases,
your
honor,
the
former
spouse
will
have
the
care
of
children.
there
are
lots
of
reasons
why
one
might
want
to
leave
benefits
to
a
former
spouse.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
and
that
would
be
--
and
that
would
be
a
short
route
to
affirmance,
your
honor.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
this
court
has
spoken
to
the
--
the
nature
of
language
like
this.
sglia
is
essentially
identical.
wissner
in
fact
predates
the
adoption
of
feglia,
and
so
congress
had
the
benefit
of
that
ruling
when
it
was
deciding
to
enact
an
--
an
order
of
precedence
in
this
statute.
the
only
real
difference
between
the
order
of
precedence
here
and
the
order
of
precedence
in
wissner
is
that
the
range
of
choice
is
even
broader.
wissner--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--it's
conceivable,
your
honor,
but
at
a
minimum,
i
think
this
--
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
when
this
court's
ruled
on
the
meaning
of
language
and
--
and
a
similar
language
is
adopted
in
a
new
statute,
it's
given
the
judicial
interpretation
unless
congress
says
otherwise.
but
here--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--either
way,
it's
preemptive,
your
honor.
if
that
is
the
purpose
behind
it,
congress
has
a
very
different
means
of
determining
intent.
and
as
the
court's
repeatedly
said,
where
you
have
conflicting
means,
you
have
preemption.
but
section
d
doesn't
call
for
any
inquiry
into
intent.
it
makes
an
assumption
about
intent,
and
then
based
on
that
assumption,
the
rule
is
automatic.
so
whether
it's
a
statute
about
intent,
it's
preempted,
because
congress
says
the
best
evidence
of
intent
is
what
you
do
on
the
beneficiary
form;
or
whether
it's
about
--
about
divorce,
it's
preempted,
because
congress
has
spoken
to
when
divorce
will
affect
the
enjoyment
of
proceeds
by
the
beneficiary.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
your
honor,
i
believe
--
i
do
agree
with
the
premise
of
your
question
was
that
the
--
which
is
that
the
slayer
would
not
be
paid.
the
path
to
that
is,
i
think,
as
follows.
i
think
if
the
slayer
statute
looks
like
a
typical
slayer
statute,
then
it's
going
to
speak
to
--
it's
going
to
relate
to
life
insurance
and
the
express
preemption
provision
would
probably
kick
in
and
it
would
call
for
a
different
result;
it
would
be
preempted.
but
there's
a
longstanding
federal
common
law
rule,
and
the
lower
courts
addressing
this
situation
have
also
held
that
--
that
that
informs
the
federal
statute
here.
the
leading
case
from
this
court
is
an
1886
decision,
national
mutual
life
insurance
v.
armstrong,
and
it
is
such
a
well-established
rule
that
i
think
congress
can
be
viewed
as
having
incorporated
that
rule
under
the
statute
by
not
having
specifically
overridden
it.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
no,
it
would
go
to
the
order
of
precedence.
so--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--it
would
be
the
widow
or
the
--
then
the
children
and
so
forth,
in
that
scenario.
if
i
may
speak
to
petitioner's
argument
about
the
rose
v.
rose
case,
i
think
that
that
case
is
really
doubly
inapposite.
first
of
all,
as
this
court
acknowledged
in
rose,
the
statute
there
was
designed
to
benefit
dependents
as
well
as
the
veteran.
and
it
distinguished
wissner
and
ridgway
as
cases
involving
a
situation
where
congress
wanted
to
give
an
absolute
right
to
the
--
the
insured
to
ensure
that
they
would
enjoy
the
benefits.
second
of
all,
at
the
--
at
the
state
law
level,
again,
there's
no
guarantee
that
--
that
the
operation
of
section
d
will
result
in
the
proceeds
going
to
one's
family.
it
could
end
up
going
to
a
perfect
stranger
under
the
next
of
kin
provision.
and
in
many
cases,
of
course,
the
former
spouse
would
be
the
one
caring
for
children.
so
it's
really,
i
think,
doubly
inapposite.
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
i
think
that
would
be
right,
your
honor.
i
mean,
that
is
the
holding
of--
mr.
steffen
n.
johnson
--yes.
the
wissner
court
said
that
the
order
of
precedence
there
was
the
controlling
provision
of
the
act,
and
it
said
the
same
thing
again
in
wissner
concerning
sglia's
order
of
precedence
and
it
said
it
displaces
inconsistent
state
law.
wissner,
of
course,
in
that
case,
it
was
community
property
law;
in
ridgway,
it
was
state
constructive
trust
law.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
anti-attachment
provision.
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
that
was
an
alternative
holding
of
the
court
in
these
earlier
cases,
and
the
court
referred
to
the
order
of
precedence
provision
as
controlling.
rose
v.
rose
itself
acknowledged
that
the
anti-attachment
provision
was
an
alternative
holding
of
the
court,
and
we
think
that
that
is
sufficient
to
--
the
order
of
precedence
provision
is
sufficient
to
resolve
this
issue.
certainly,
congress,
looking
at
the
court's
opinion
in
1954
when
it
enacted
feglia,
would
have
been
likely
to
conclude
that.
in
--
in
summary,
your
honors,
this
case
is
not
a
difficult
case
for
a
finding
of
preemption
under
this
court's
precedence.
it's
really
a
much
easier
case.
it's
not
dealing
with
generally
applicable
law.
it's
governed
squarely
by
precedent,
and
the
statute
at
issue
here,
section
d,
is
effectively
an
attempt
to
do
an
end
run
on
the
will
of
congress.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
defer
to
ms.
goldenberg.
