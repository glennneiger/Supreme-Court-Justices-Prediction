in
other
words,
they're
preempted,
but
the
whole
purpose
of
the
preemption
can
be
thwarted.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
--
but
quite
apart
from
--
from
that,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
proposal
the
congress
would
actually
have
accepted
a
situation
where
one
spouse
sues
a
former
spouse.
in
other
words,
you
have
a
--
that's
the
whole
design
of
this
statute.
would
the
insurance
company
--
if
you
were
representing
the
insurance
company,
would
you
tell
the
insurance
company
that
they
were
completely
safe
in
paying
the
benefits
to
the
first
spouse
even
if
there's
going
to
be
a
suit
afterwards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
would
the
insurance
company
itself
be
under
some
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
design
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
just
wondering
whether
under
state
law
the
insurance
company,
if
it
--
if
it
knows
this
doesn't
have
some
duty
to
refrain
from
making
the
payment
or
to
put
it
in
escrow
or
to
interplead.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
you're
representing
the
insurance
company,
you
wouldn't
say
you
better
interplead
to
be
on
the
safe
side?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
--
in
the
wissner
case,
there
was
a
community
property
state.
do
you
know,
under
the
statute
we're
dealing
with
here,
is
community
property
in
those
states
also
preempted
so
that
the
--
the
insured
is
the
sole
owner
of
the
policy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
was
a
specific
provision
on
that
point
in
wissner,
and
i
--
or
the
court
so
read
it.
and
i
take
it
the
same
provision
applies
--
exists
in
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
--
your
concern
is
there
might
be
fraudulent
wills?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
grasping
at
straws.
