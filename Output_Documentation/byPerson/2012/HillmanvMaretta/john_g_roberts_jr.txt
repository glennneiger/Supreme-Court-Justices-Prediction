v.

g.

of
course,
if
the
ex-wife
were
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
this
money
would
not
necessarily
go
to
her,
right;
it
would
go
to
the
bankruptcy
estate?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
--
so
why
is
the
state
law
any
different--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--with
respect
to
divorces?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he's
--
by
the
time
the
issue
comes
up.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
goldenberg.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
far
--
how
far
does
that
go?
obviously,
the
benefit
becomes
the
property
of
the
named
beneficiary,
but
it's
not
like
to
her
enjoyment.
she
may
want
to
spend
it
on
something,
but
it's
going
to
be
--
have
to
go
through
bankruptcy,
it's
going
to
have
to
go
through
other
claims
like
any
other
property
under
state
law.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean,
we
do
get
these
cases
over
and
over
again.
i
mean,
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
--
it
may
be
very
easy
to
do,
but
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
people
often
overlook.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
ruttenberg,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1221,
hillman
versus
maretta.
