ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
d
seeks
to
substitute
a
new
beneficiary
in
place
of
the
one
that
federal
law
mandates,
and
it
does
that
through
an
attempted
end
run
around
federal
preemption.
i'd
like
to
start
off
by
talking
about
the
purpose
of
the
federal
law,
which
several
of
the
court's
prior
questions
spoke
to.
the
purpose
here
is
to
get
benefits
to
the
designated
beneficiary
for
that
person's
beneficial
enjoyment.
that's
the
purpose
that
the
court
found
in
very
similar
language
in
ridgway
and
wissner.
and
that's--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
designated
beneficiary
is
benefiting
in
a
sense
when
that
money
is
used
to
pay
that
person's
obligations.
so
we
don't
deny
that
because
there's
no
anti-attachment
provision
here,
the
designated
beneficiary
could
be
subject
to
a
contracts
judgment,
a
tort
judgment,
it
could
have
to
pay
other
outstanding
obligations
that
that
person
has.
but
that
is
extremely
different
than
a
law
like
the
one
we
have
here
that
says,
in
effect,
to
the
designated
beneficiary,
you
know
what,
we
don't
really
think
you're
entitled
to
this
money.
we
don't
really
think
you
deserve
it.
we
don't
think
you
have,
in
effect,
equitable
title
to
it.
we
think
that
belongs
to
somebody
else
and
so
we're
just
going
to
transfer
the
proceeds
to
that
other
person.
that's
an
extremely
different
situation.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
purposes
served
by
that,
and
that
speaks
to
the
will
question
that
your
honor
asked
earlier.
for
one
thing,
it
creates
certainty
in
the
process,
not
only
for
the
insured,
but
also
for
the
beneficiary,
who's
not
going
to
have
to
face
some
kind
of
long
legal
contest
over
the
money
that
may
eat
up
the
proceeds
in
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
and
that
was
a
purpose
that
congress
specifically
articulated
when
it
made
the
1966
amendment
to
the
statute.
it
also--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
it
creates
a
clear
and
uniform
set
of
rules
that
everyone
can
abide
by.
and
also,
i
think
in
the
case
of
a
will,
it
protects
the
insured
from
fraud.
that
was
another
purpose
that
congress
gave
in
1966.
they
don't
want
a
situation
where
someone
is
going
to
find
a
will
after
the
fact
and
say:
look,
this
shows
what
this
person
really
thought.
the
designated
beneficiary
form
is
the
expression
of
--
of
the
person's
intent,
and
that's
particularly
true
here,
where
you
have
a
very
clear
network
of
rules
set
up
by
the
federal
government
that
tells
insureds
what
they
must
do
if
they
want
to
change
their
beneficiary
designation,
and
tells
them
that
their
beneficiary
designation
is
going
to--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--it's
possible
that
if
you
are
looking
outside
the
designated
--
the
beneficiary
designation
form,
that
you
may
have
people
trying
to
come
up
with
some
other
expressions
of
intent.
it
could
be
a
will,
it
could
be
a
letter,
it
could
be
other
things.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
well,
your
honor,
that's,
as
i
say,
one
of
the
purposes
that
congress
gave
when
it
passed
that
amendment
in
1966
that
said
you
don't
conduct
this
free-floating
inquiry
into
the
insured's
intent.
you
don't
ask,
what
would
the
insured
have
said
if
someone
had
asked
them
in
the
last
moment
of
their
life
what
they
had
--
what
would
they
want.
you
look
at
the
designated
beneficiary,
you
look
at
the
beneficiary
designation
form.
and
as
i
was
saying,
in
--
in
part,
that's
because
it's
so
easy
to
change.
it's
a
one-page
form.
it's
very
simple.
and
insureds
are
told
over
and
over
again:
you
have
to
keep
your
beneficiary
designation
up
to
date;
divorce
doesn't--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--well,
they--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--opm
actually
does
instruct
agencies
to
periodically
remind
employees
that
they
must
keep
their
beneficiary
designations
up
to
date.
obviously,
there
is
no
way
to
know
exactly
what
mr.
hillman
was
told
here--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--i
hope
it's
clear
at
this
point.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
that
may
be,
but,
nevertheless,
federal
law
sets
up
the
rules
and
expects
people
to
abide
by
them.
and
what
you
can't
have
is
the
opposite
rule,
because
that
just
creates
tremendous
confusion.
and
i
think
the
conflict
here
is
very
starkly
illustrated
when
you
think
about
what
somebody
who
designated
their
spouse
and
got
divorced
and
then
wanted
to
keep
that
person
as
their
beneficiary
would
hear
from
the
federal
government
if
they
went
and
said,
what
should
i
do?
i
really
want
my
ex-spouse
to
keep
being
the
beneficiary.
what
ought
i
to
do?
and
if
they
were
to
consult
the
feglia
handbook,
if
they
were
to
ask
opm,
they
would
be
told:
do
nothing;
that
beneficiary
designation
is
valid;
it's
going
to
remain
valid
until
you
change
it
yourself.
now,
that
person's
intent
would
be
overridden
by
section
d,
which
would
essentially
pluck
the
benefits
right
out
of
the
hand
of
the
ex-spouse
that
that
person
meant
them
to
go
to
and
transfer
them
over
to
somebody
else.
and
that
makes
essentially
the
focus
of
the
federal
law
on
the
designated
beneficiary
meaningless.
it
makes
the
award
of
the
proceeds
to
that
person
a
meaningless
gesture.
that's
the
language
that
this
court
used
in
free
v.
bland,
which
was
a
case
about
ownership
of
federal
bonds.
and
that
can't
be
what
congress
intended.
and
you
can't
have
these
two
different
default
rules
operating
together
and
--
and
have
a
system
that
works.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
certainly
think
it's
possible,
your
honor.
i
think
every
person
is
different,
every
divorce
is
different.
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
i
don't
know--
ms.
elaine
j.
goldenberg
--i
don't
know
if
i
can
speak
to
how
common
it
is,
but,
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
there
may
be
many
reasons
why
somebody
would
want
to
give
their
ex-spouse
the
insurance
proceeds.
and
i
think
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
effectuating
the
intent
of
the
insured
as
expressed
in
their
designated
--
in
their
designation
form
--
so
that
there
would
be
a
clear
system,
a
uniform
system;
and
again,
so
that
the
beneficiary
would
be
protected
against
actions
much
like
this
one,
that
create
all
this
confusion
over
who
is
actually
entitled
to
the
proceeds,
and
may
--
may
eat
them
up
in
--
in
legal
fees.
in
addition,
i'd
point
out
that
if
petitioner
is
correct,
then
you
could
have
other
state
laws
that
are
like
this
one
that
try
to
rewrite
the
order
of
precedence.
and
essentially,
the
federal
order
of
precedence
could
be
completely
undone
by
state
law.
you'd
also
have
a
situation
in
which
federal
employees
attempting
to
figure
out
where
their
benefits
are
really
going
to
go
would
have
to
make
themselves
familiar
with
state
law.
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out
earlier,
there
may
be
serious
choice
of
law
problems
there.
the
vast
majority
of
these
employees
are
not
attorneys
and
this
is
a
tremendous
burden
to
place
on
them.
it's
much
simpler
and
clearer
to
have
the
system
that
we
have
under
federal
law,
and
that's
why
that
system
was
set
up.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
