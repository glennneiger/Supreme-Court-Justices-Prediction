justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
it
make
an
exception
then
only
for
divorce
decrees?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there
is
an
express
exception
in
the
statute
that
the
beneficiary
can
be
changed
by
a
decree
of
divorce.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
would
congress
say
that
while
at
the
same
time
believing
that
the
beneficiary
can
effectively
be
changed
without
a
decree
of
divorce?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
you
know,
the
--
the
exception
suggests
another
thing
besides
the
fact
that
it
suggests
that
the
only
way
the
second
spouse
prevails
is
by
a
divorce
decree.
it
also
suggests
that
congress's
sole
purpose
--
that
congress
did
not
have
the
sole
purpose
in
this
statute
to
make
it
easy
for
the
insurance
company
that
has
to
pay
out
the
proceeds
to
know
whom
the
--
who
the
beneficiary
will
be.
if
that
were
the
case,
there
wouldn't
be
this
exception
for
a
divorce
decree,
because
the
insurance
company
is
going
to
have
to
look
to
see
if
there's
a
divorce
decree
on
the
books,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
that
obviously
shows
that
congress
in
this
statute
not
only
had
a
concern
about
efficiency
of
payment,
but
also
had
a
concern
about
who
gets
the
payment,
right?
there's
no
other
way
to
explain
the
--
the
exception
for
divorce
decrees.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
that's
the
--
that's
the
purpose
of
this
exception
for
divorce
decrees?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
your
experience,
a
man
usually
has
more
children
or
children
in
his
second
marriage
than
he
did
in
his
first?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
so,
either.
i
--
i
think
if
congress
was
concerned
about
money
for
the
kids,
it
would
have
left
the
money
with
the
first
wife.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
the
divorce
exemption
blows
away
that
--
that
explanation,
that
all
congress
is
concerned
about
is
efficient
administration
of
the
plan
so
long
as
the
insurer
will
know.
you
know,
just
look
at
the
--
look
at
the
--
at
the
contract,
the
named
beneficiary,
pay
the
money
to
the
named
beneficiary,
and
you're
home
free.
that
--
that
is
blown
away
by
the
exception
for
divorce
decrees.
the
insurer
is
going
to
have
to
check
that
there
hasn't
been
a
divorce
since
the
contract
was
signed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
they
have
to
check
to
see
if
it
has
been
properly
filed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
keep
--
i
keep
coming
back
to
the
explicit
divorce
provision,
which
says
when
there's
a
divorce
decree,
only
properly
filed,
it,
without
a
change
by
the
beneficiary,
goes
to
the
new
wife,
okay.
and
you're
telling
us
that
even
without
a
divorce
decree,
the
new
wife
will
effectively
get
the
money
so
long
as
there
is
a
state
law
that
says
all
--
all
proceeds
from
insurance
companies
for
policies
entered
into
before
the
--
before
the
--
the
decedent
was
divorced
will
go
to
the
new
wife.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
such
a
--
such
a
blatant
frustration
of
the
--
not
just
the
purpose
of
--
of
the
very
text
of
the
divorce
provision
in
the
law,
which
says
only
if
there
is
a
decree
properly
filed
will
it
go
to
the
new
wife.
and
you're
saying,
well,
it
doesn't
really
matter
so
long
as
there's
a
state
law
which
says
it
will
go
to
the
new
wife
without
a
--
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
they
just
say,
look,
if
the
--
if
the
state
law
says
so,
the
--
the
new
wife
gets
it?
why
didn't
they
just
say
that
instead
of
--
you're
telling
me
they
set
up
this
--
this
sick
system
in
which
the
--
the
former
wife
or
the
new
wife
has
to
sue
the
former
wife
to
get
the
money
that
was
paid
to
the
former
wife.
i
mean,
my
goodness.
what
--
our
courts
are
crowded
with
--
with
suits
between,
you
know
--
why
--
why
don't
they
just
say,
if
the
state
law
says
it,
it
goes
to
the
new
wife.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
guess
--
i
guess
you
might
--
you
might
respond
also
that,
you
know,
it's
characterized
by
--
by
your
--
your
friend
as
a
--
a
state
law
having
to
do
with
--
with
marriage
and
--
and
so
forth.
maybe.
but
maybe
it's
just
a
state
law
having
to
do
with
discernment
of
intent.
and
here
you
have
a
federal
statute
and
i
guess
the
federal
congress's
assertion
of
what's
the
best
discernment
of
intent,
in
the
natural
order
of
things,
ought
to
prevail
over
the
state's
assessment
of
what's
--
what's
the
clearest
expression
of
intent,
right.
i
don't
know
why
it's
a
family
law
provision
as
much
as
it
is
a
provision
of
what
the
presumed
intent
of
--
of
a
decedent
is.
and
here
the
--
the
federal
government
has
spoken
to
it
with
respect
to
a
federal
statute,
and
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
intruding
upon
state
family
law
for
--
for
the
federal
government
to
--
to
assert,
in
its
own
right,
intent
under
this
statute
is
--
is
determined
this
way.
