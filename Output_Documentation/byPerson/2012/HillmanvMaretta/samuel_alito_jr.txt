justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
an
insured,
after
making
a
designation
of
a
beneficiary,
writes
a
will
and
leaves
the
insurance
proceeds
to
a
different
person,
the
federal
law
would
still,
as
interpreted
by
the
state
supreme
court,
require
the
money
to
be
paid
to
the
designated
beneficiary,
wouldn't
it?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
what
does
that
say
about
congress's
supposed
desire
to
ensure
that
the
money
goes
to
the
person
that
the
insured
wants
it
to
go
to?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
the
point
is
if
congress's
objective,
if
one
of
its
objectives
in
addition
to
administrative
convenience
was
to
effectuate
the
will
of
the
insured,
then
i
don't
see
why
it
would
provide
for
federal
law
to
override
a
subsequent
will
which
directly
expresses
the
desire
of
the
insured.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
my
problem
with
this
case
is,
other
than
administrative
convenience,
i
don't
see
what
purpose
congress
could
have
thought
that
this
provision
serves.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
else
--
what
other
--
what
other
objective
do
you
think
congress
was
trying
to
achieve?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
why
would
it
override
the
expressed
will
of
an
insured
in
--
the
express
desire
of
an
insured
in,
for
example,
a
will
that's
executed
after
the
time
of
the
assignment--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--and
the
designation
of
the
beneficiary.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
why?
you've
got
a
--
you've
got
a
designation
of
the
beneficiary
in
1975,
let's
say,
and
then
you
have
a
will
that's
executed
in
2005.
why
would
congress
want
the
--
the
designation
of
the
beneficiary
so
far
in
the
past
to
override
the
expression
of
the
desire
of
the
insured
in
the
subsequent
will?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
how
can
that
be
the
best
designation
of
intent?
you
have
a
designation
long
in
the
past,
then
you
have
a
will
that
says
that:
the
insurance
proceeds
i'm
leaving
to
a
different
person.
how
is
the
earlier
designation
of
a
beneficiary
a
better
expression
of
intent?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
that
provides
a
simple
--
that
provides
a
--
a
simple
rule
for
the
people
who
are
affected
by
this
dispute,
and
those
are
the
people
who
are
--
who
stand
to
benefit
either
under
the
designation
of
the
beneficiary
or
under
the
will.
but
what
--
why
does
congress
care
about
that?
there
are
a
lot
of
messy
domestic
relations
issues
out
there
in
the
states.
that's
what
congress
was
doing?
they
said,
you
know,
these
--
that
state
domestic
relations
law
leads
to
a
lot
of
nasty
and
difficult
disputes
--
you
know,
bleak
house.
let's
intervene
and
let's
simplify
this
with
a
simple
rule.
do
you
think
that's
what
was
involved
here.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
why
would
congress
want
to
make
sure
that
the
money
goes
to
the
designated
beneficiary
where
there
is
a
very
clear
expression
of
intent
on
the
part
of
the
insured
that
the
money
go
someplace
else.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
these
arguments
seem
to
be
circular.
you're
saying
that
the
--
the
reason
for
making
sure
that
the
designated
beneficiary
gets
the
money
instead
of
the
person
whom
the
insured
has
subsequently
and
very
clearly
said
he
or
she
wants
to
get
the
money
is
to
make
sure
that
the
designated
beneficiary
gets
the
money,
and
gets
it
without
any
hassle.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
when
are
they
told
--
when
are
they
told
over
and
over
again?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
they
--
they
get
the
form
when
they
--
when
they
sign
up
for
the
life
insurance,
so
they
periodically
get
notices
from
opm
saying,
now,
remember,
you've
designated
so-and-so
as
your
beneficiary,
you
know,
annually,
like
in
the
open
season?
do
you
really
want
to
keep
this
person
as
your
beneficiary?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
nobody
has
told
me
that
in
many
years.
[laughter]
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
think
that
situation
comes
up
a
lot,
where
an
--
an
insured
wants
to
make
sure
that
a
former
spouse
gets
more
money
than
the
spouse
is
entitled
to
under
the
divorce
decree?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
everything
is
possible.
do
you
think
that's
a
common
situation;
that's
what
congress
was--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--was
concerned
about?
