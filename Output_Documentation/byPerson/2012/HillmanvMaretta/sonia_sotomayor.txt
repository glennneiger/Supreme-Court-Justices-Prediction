so
why
not
just
say
that?
if
that
was
congress's
intent,
why
limit
it
to
a
specific
form
of
state
borders
involving
divorce,
annulment,
et
cetera?
why
not
just
simply
say
in
80
--
80705(e)
that
any
court
order
could
change
the
order
of
precedence,
if
that
was
congress's
intent?
justice

sotomayor
the
federal
employees'
group
life
insurance
act
of
1954
feglia
establishes
a
life
insurance
program
for
federal
employees.
feglia
provides
an
employee,
may
appoint
a
beneficiary
to
receive
insurance
proceeds
after
his
death.
this
case
turns
on
the
relationship
between
feglia
and
a
virginia
statute.
section
20-111.1(a)
of
the
virginia
code,
section
a
revokes
a
beneficiary
designation
in
any
contract
that
provides
a
death
benefit
to
a
former
spouse
when
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
decedent's
marital
status.
in
the
event
that
this
provision
is
preempted
by
federal
law,
a
different
provision,
section
20-111.1(d)
of
the
virginia
code,
section
d
creates
a
cause
of
action
rendering
a
former
spouse
liable
for
the
proceeds
to
whoever
could
have
received
them
if
section
8
were
not
preempted.
this
case
presents
a
--
the
question
whether
section
d
is
itself
preempted
by
feglia.
warren
hillman
and
respondent
judy
maretta
were
married.
in
1996,
warren
named
maretta
as
a
beneficiary
of
his
feglia
policy.
warren
and
maretta
divorced
in
1998
and
warren
subsequently
married
petitioner
jacqueline
hillman.
warren
died
in
2008.
at
that
time,
warren
had
never
changed
his
beneficiary
designation
and
maretta
collected
the
proceeds
of
his
life
insurance
as
the
named
beneficiary.
hillman,
then,
brought
an
action
in
virginia
circuit
court
arguing
that
maretta
was
liable
to
her
under
section
d
for
the
proceeds.
maretta
argued
in
response
that
section
d
is
preempted
by
federal
law
and
that
she
should
keep
the
proceeds.
the
virginia
court
rejected
that
argument
and
found
her
liable
to
hillman
for
the
proceeds.
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
turn
reversed
holding
that
section
d
is
preempted
by
federal
law.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
under
our
precedents,
state
law
is
preempted
when
it
stands
as
an
impediment
to
congress'
purposes
and
objectives.
in
ascertaining
congress'
purposes
here,
we
do
not
write
on
a
clean
slate.
in
two
previous
cases,
we
found
that
federal
statutes
similar
to
feglia
preempted
laws
--
rules
of
state
law
requiring
that
insurance
proceeds
be
paid
to
a
person
other
than
a
named
beneficiary.
in
wissner
versus
wissner,
we
considered
whether
the
national
service
life
insurance
act
of
1940
preempted
as
rule
of
state
marital
property
law.
there,
a
california
court
granted
a
decedent's
widow
who
was
not
the
named
beneficiary
an
interest
in
the
insurance
proceeds.
we
reverse
holding
that
the
federal
statute
preempted
the
state
law
action.
we
explained
that
congress
had
made
clear
that
the
proceeds
paid
under
the
federal
statute
belonged
to
the
named
beneficiary
and
no
other.
and
we
found
that
the
california
trust
conflicted
with
that
purpose.
then
in
ridgway
versus
ridgway,
we
considered
a
similar
question
regarding
the
federal
servicemen's
group
life
insurance,
seglia.
a
maine
court
imposed
a
constructive
trust
on
insurance
proceeds
paid
to
a
named
beneficiary,
an
order
that
they
be
transferred
to
the
decedent's
first
wife
under
the
terms
of
a
divorce
decree.
we
found
the
trust
preempted.
we
reasoned
that
the
statute
was
similar
to
the
one
we
considered
in
wissner
in
a
critical
respect.
both
statutes
reflect
that
congress'
purpose
in
requiring
that
the
proceeds
belong
to
a
named
beneficiary
and
that
she
be
able
to
use
them.
and
we
concluded
that
the
maine
trust
conflicted
with
that
purpose
by
taking
the
proceeds
from
the
named
beneficiary
and
reallocating
them
to
someone
else.
the
same
reasoning
applies
here.
the
statutes
we
considered
in
ridgway
and
wissner
are
similar
to
feglia.
like
these
statutes,
feglia
plainly
gives
highest
priority
to
a
named
beneficiary.
and
feglia
includes
an
order
of
precedents
nearly
identical
to
the
one
congress
enacted
in
seglia.
feglia
accordingly
reflects
congress'
clear
purpose
that
the
proceeds
should
actually
belong
to
the
beneficiary.
as
in
ridgway
and
wissner,
section
d
conflicts
with
that
purpose
by
allocating
the
proceeds
to
another
person.
we,
therefore,
hold
that
section
d
is
preempted
by
federal
law.
the
judgment
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
affirmed.
justice
thomas
and
justice
alito
have
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
