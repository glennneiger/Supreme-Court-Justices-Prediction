justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
do
you
resist
--
i'm
just
curious.
i
--
i
would
have
thought
that
to
answer
justice
scalia
you
were
going
to
say
the
answer
is
it
isn't
more
accurate.
if
you
write
a
will
and
say
i
want
these
proceeds
now
to
go
to
my
second
wife,
that
is
a
better
expression
of
the
person's
intent.
but
if
you
open
that
door,
you'll
get
other
wills
that
aren't
quite
so
clear,
and
that's
the
problem
that
congress
faced.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he
is
right,
if
the
only
consideration
that
led
congress
to
make
this
absolute
rule
and
so
forth
the
underlying
the
previous
holdings,
if
the
only
consideration
were
ease
of
administration
by
the
federal
administrator,
this
statute
wouldn't
undermine
it.
so
--
so
isn't
that
true?
i
mean,
the
federal
administrator
writes
the
check
to
the
person
that's
on
the
list.
this
is
a
matter
after
the
check
gets
mailed,
or
this
doesn't
undermine
it
at
all;
there
is
no
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
and
if
that
were
the
only
consideration,
administration,
this
doesn't
interfere
with
federal
administration.
so
in
order
to
find
something
to
--
to
interfere
with,
we
have
to
figure
that
they
are
trying
to
protect
an
interest
like
the
following:
the
person
is
married
twice.
he
secretly
wants
to
leave
the
insurance
in
the
name
of
his
first
wife
while
pretending
to
the
second
wife
it
was
just
an
oversight.
i
mean,
that's
what
we
have
to
make
up
in
order
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
maybe
we
should
say,
look,
this
is
a
statute
that
is
absolute.
there
is
no
interest.
all
this
does
is
run
around,
without
being
too
pejorative,
it
runs
around
the
earlier
cases,
which
is
your
basic
point.
it's
absolute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
