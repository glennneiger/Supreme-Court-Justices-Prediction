not
payment
over
towing;
payment
over
storage.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
if
this
was
a
consensual
contract,
he
asked
--
justice
scalia's
question.
they
contracted
for
the
tow.
what
state
laws
would
be
preempted
under
the
faaaa
with
respect
to
that
private
contract?
would
there
be
any?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
about,
do
consumer
fraud
laws
apply
to
that
contract
between
the
parties?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
the
basis
of
his
claim
here.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
ah,
so
you're
arguing
that
those
laws
would
be
preempted.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
gets
back
to
whether
the
services
include
storage,
which
is
what
the
new
hampshire
court
said
it
doesn't.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that
the
movement
of
property
or
towing
doesn't
include
services
for
storage.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
why
don't
you
answer
that
question?
as
i
read
the
list
of
things
that
are
preempted,
they
have
to
do
with
storage
during
transportation.
why
should
we
read
it
more
broadly
than
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
your
problem,
which
is,
what
is
it
directed
to?
and
that's
the
real
issue
in
this
case.
yes,
it's
preempted
with
respect
to
any
towing
activity.
the
issue
is,
is
it
--
is
it
preempted,
as
the
new
hampshire
court,
said
to
storage
and
sale?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
do
we
draw
the
line,
that
line
that
you
just
asked
us
to
draw
between
direct
and
indirect?
how
do
we
articulate
that
line?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
now
you're
--
now
you're
articulating
a
different
line.
you
are
saying
this
--
the
hypothetical
that
justice
kagan
posited
is
not
storage-related,
it
is
something
else-related.
it's
towing-related.
what's
the
difference?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
that
justice
breyer
is
--
i
may
be
speaking
for
him
--
he's
thinking
that
that
state
contract
or
that
state
regulation
that
permits
towing
companies
to
do
this
is
preempted
in
some
way.
that
would
be
his
argument,
because
it
affects--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--no?
