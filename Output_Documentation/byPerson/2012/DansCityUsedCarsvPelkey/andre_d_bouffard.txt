mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
14501
of
the
united
states
transportation
code
expressly
preempts
the
respondent's
state
law
consumer
protection
in
tort
claims
for
damages
against
a
tow
trucker
who
towed
his
vehicle
lawfully
and
then,
several
months
later,
disposed
of
the
vehicle
after
the
fees
for
towing
and
storage
had
not
been
paid.
both
of
these
claims
are
preempted
because
they
are
directed
at
the
conduct
--
the
type
of
conduct
that
tow
truck
companies
all
over
this
country
every
day
engage
in,
in
dealing
with
a
particular
type
of
tow
that's
referred
to
in
the
business
as
nonconsensual
tows.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
justice
ginsburg,
this
law
regulates
abandoned
motor
vehicles.
it's
an
abandoned
motor
vehicle
law.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
well,
if
a
garage
operator
came
into
possession
of
an
abandoned
motor
vehicle,
then
i
suppose
it
would.
if
--
if
you
look
at
the
--
at
the
title
to
this
subchapter
of
this
new
hampshire
statute,
the
title
is
abandoned
vehicles,
your
honor.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
well,
let
me
be
clear
about
this
statute,
your
honor.
it's
an
abandoned
vehicle
statute,
and
what's
really
important
to
understand
with
this
case
is
that
none
of
the
plaintiff's
claims
rely
on
this
abandoned
vehicle
statute.
the
plaintiff
has
pled
in
his
complaint
a
couple
of
allegations
of
violations
of
this
abandoned
vehicle
law,
but
the
substantive
rights
that
were
sued
upon
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
do
not
live
in
the
abandoned
motor
vehicle
law.
the
substantive
rights
that
were
sued
upon
by
the
plaintiff
live
in
the
state's
consumer
protection
law,
which
is
a
separate
new
hampshire
statute,
unrelated
to
the
abandoned
vehicle
law.
and
secondly,
the
claim
that
the
--
the
common
law
negligence
claim
in
this
case
arises
out
of
the
common
law
of
new
hampshire.
it
doesn't
arise
out
of
the
abandoned
motor
vehicle
law.
one
of
the
sources
of
confusion,
i
would
submit,
in
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court's
decision
is
that
it
did
not
adequately
deal
with
the
--
the
role
of
the
abandoned
vehicle
law
in
this
case.
the
abandoned
vehicle
law
actually
plays
a
relatively
minor
role
as
it
relates
to
the
causes
of
action
that
were
pled
in
this
case
and
the
causes
of
action
that
the
preemption
defense
is
directed
to
in
this
case.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
the
reason
--
the
reason
why
these
claims
are
preempted,
your
honor,
is
because
they
all
stem
from
the
towing
of
the
vehicle,
which
was
followed
by
the
storage
of
the
vehicle.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
well,
i
think
that's
a
different--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
we're
not--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--there's
no
--
there's
no
claim
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
the
abandoned
motor
vehicle
law
is
preempted,
that
new
hampshire's
abandoned
motor
vehicle
law--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--we
are
arguing
that
the
causes
of
action
that
were
pled
in
this
case,
which
are
a
consumer
protection
act
claim
for
damages
and
attorneys'
fees,
treble
damages
actually
in
the
consumer
protection
act
claim,
that
claim
is
predicated
on
the
consumer
protection
law,
it's
predicated
on
the
state
of
new
hampshire's
policy
protecting
consumers.
now,
there's
--
there's
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
there
was
also
--
there
happened
to
be
a
violation
of
this
abandoned
vehicle
law.
but
that
is
a
completely
meaningless
allegation
as
it
relates
to
the
consumer
protection
act,
because
even
if
it
were
a
violation
of
the
abandoned
vehicle
law,
that
would
not
make
it
a
violation
of
the
consumer
protection
law.
consumer
protection
laws
are
intended
to
regulate
fairness
in
business
practices.
that's
what
that
statute
is
about.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
well,
there's
a
difference,
your
honor,
justice
scalia,
between
whether
the
case
is
predicated
on
the
new
hampshire
towing
law
and
whether
or
not
these
causes
of
action
are
related
to
the
towing
of
the
vehicle.
our
point,
and
our
primary
argument,
is
that
all
of
these
claims
are
related
to,
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
to
the
towing
of
the
vehicle.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
that's
a
very
different
set
of
circumstances,
justice
scalia.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
well,
this
--
this
case
involves
a
nonconsensual
tow.
this
case
involves
a
situation
where
there
was
an
opportunity,
a
fair
opportunity,
to
pay
for
the
towing
and
the
storage
charges
that
had
been
incurred,
and--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--no,
we
wouldn't--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--i
--
i
think
the
state
could
regulate
that,
your
honor.
what
the
state
--
what
the
--
what
a
private
plaintiff
can't
do
in
a
case
like
this
is
assert
claims
like
common
law
negligence
claims--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--a--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--i
think
--
i
think
a
private
plaintiff
could
--
could
probably
assert
that,
that
negligence
claim.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
that
situation
doesn't
involve
a
payment
dispute,
your
honor.
this
case
--
the
case
we
have
before
us
today,
involves
a
payment
dispute.
this
is
really
a
payment
dispute.
a
person--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--well,
that
--
that's
not
a
payment
dispute.
the
parties
haven't
--
haven't
disputed
whether
or
not
there
--
there
is
a
payment
obligation.
the
part
--
this
--
this
case
is
about
a
dispute
over
whether
there
is
even
an
obligation
to
pay
for
the
--
the
towing
and
the
storage
services.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
this
--
this
plaintiff
had
an
opportunity
to
pay
for
and
to
discharge
his
obligation
under
state
law.
i
--
i
feel
the
need
to--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
we
don't
agree
with
that.
it
is
--
it
is
exactly
that
kind
of
case.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
there
--
there's
a
letter
in
the
record
of
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
your
honor,
it's
--
i
believe
it's
at
page
86
and
87
of
the
record
in
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court,
which
is
a
letter
from
mr.
shaughnessy,
counsel
for
mr.
pelkey,
to
my
client.
and
this
letter
was
written
something
in
the
range
of
3
months
after
the
towing
took
place,
and
--
and
before
the
vehicle
had
been
disposed
of.
and
the
letter
asserts
that
mr.
pelkey
doesn't
believe
he
should
have
to
pay
for
any
storage
fees.
he
would
--
he
would
pay
the
towing
fees,
but
he
doesn't
believe
he
should
have
to
pay
for
any
of
the
storage
fees.
and
that's
--
that's
--
that's
really
reflective
of
what
this
case
is
really
all
about.
it's
about
a
dispute
over
payment.
and
the
reason
why
this
case
is
so
significant--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--he
--
he
offered
in
this
letter
to
pay
the
towing
fees
only.
there
was
never
any
tender
of
payment.
there
was
an
offer
to
pay,
provided
that
--
provided
that
my
client
would
tow
the
vehicle
back
to
his
place
of
residence
because
the
vehicle
wasn't
operative
at
the
time.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
the
--
any
breach
of
contract
claim
that
might
arise
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
would
not
be
preempted.
that's
what
the
court
decided
in
the
wolens
decision.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
the
consumer
fraud
law
might--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--it
might
apply
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
but
it
would
be
preempted.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
it
would
be
preempted
to
the
extent
that
it's
a
--
the
case
involves
a
dispute
over
payment
for
the
services.
this
is
a
--
this
case
is
a--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--the
new
hampshire--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--that's
what
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
said,
relying
on
the
minority
view
that's
come
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
charas
decision.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
i
think
--
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
you
are
referring
to
the
argument
that's
been
made
by
my
friends
with
regard
to
the
final
phrase
in
the
statute
with
respect
to
transportation--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--and
the
short
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
term
“
transportation
”
is
a
defined
term
in
title
49,
and
it's
defined
very
broadly
for
--
for
good
reason,
because
that
term
is
used
throughout
title
49.
in
fact,
the
term
is
used
to
define
the
scope
of
jurisdiction
of
the
department
of
transportation,
and
the
definition
of
transportation
is
quite
broad,
and--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--that's
correct.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
if
you
tow
a
motor
vehicle,
you
bring
the
motor
vehicle
into
your
possession
via
towing
and,
as
is
the
case
here,
you
also
store
the
vehicle.
and
in
particular
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
claimant
was
seeking
to
have
the
vehicle
returned
to
his
place
of
business
--
to
his
place
of
residence,
those
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
wasn't
necessarily
the
end
of
the
transportation.
the
plaintiff
here,
the
respondent,
was
asking
for
further
transportation
services
at
the
end
of
the
day.
so
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
transportation
hadn't
ended.
but
even
if
--
we
do
have
a
situation
where
there
would
have
been
no
further
transportation.
the
--
the
reading
that
my
friends
have
advocated
inserts
the
word
“
incidental
”
to
--
to
transportation
in
the
statute
that
doesn't
appear
in
the
statute.
the
definition
of
“
transportation
”
doesn't
include
the
word
--
doesn't
say
"storage
incidental
to
the
movement
of
property.
"
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
that
that
scenario
would
fall
within
what
congress
intended
by
the
term
“
services
”
there.
that
--
that
claim
--
that
claim
that
--
that
you've
described,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
a
claim
that
would
really
be
a
--
a
breach
of
contract
claim
between
the
tow
truck
owners
and
his
landlord.
that
would
be
a
--
a
contract
dispute.
it
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
relate
to
the
transportation
services
of
the
--
of
the
tow
truck
company
in
a
way
that
is
picked
up
by
this
preemption
statute.
it
relates
to
it
in
a
very
tangential
way,
in
a
very
remote
way,
i
suppose,
but
not
--
not
in
a
way
that's
close
enough
--
not
in
a
way
that
--
that
relates
to
the
business
of
a
tow
truck
company
in
the
way
that
payment
disputes
over
--
over
the
services
relate
to
the
business
of
the
tow
truck
company.
there
are
any
number
of
different
types
of
disputes
that
motor
carriers,
like
tow
truck
companies,
could
get
involved
in
that
wouldn't
be
preempted
here.
motor
carriers
are
involved
in
lots
of
different
types
of
business
activity
that
doesn't
involve
the
delivery
of
their
services.
they
could
be
involved
in
a
real
estate
transaction,
for
example.
they
may
be
buying
a
new
--
a
new
depot,
and
there
may
be
claims
that
arise
out
of
disputes
in
connection
with
that
real
estate
transaction.
those
claims
aren't
preempted
by
this
statute,
even
though
in
a
very
remote
sense,
they
--
those
--
those
disputes
might
be
related
to
the
business
of
--
of
the
motor
carrier.
it's
very
remote,
unlike
a
situation
where
the
claim
arises
out
of
the
actual
delivery
of
the
transportation
services.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
i
don't
think
that's
preempted,
your
honor.
i
--
i
--
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
there's
a
whole
line
of
court
of
appeals'
decisions
in
the
airline
area
that
deal
with
negligence
claims
arising
out
of
the
negligent
operation
of
the
aircraft.
and
your
scenario
is
the
negligent
operation
of
a
tow
truck
as
opposed
to
an
aircraft.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
well,
literally,
i
think
you're
--
you're
right,
your
honor,
that
--
that
the
scenario
you
describe
could
fall
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
but
the
court
has
said
that
we
can't
go
--
we
can't
necessarily
go
to
the
literal
end
of
the
earth
in
the
reading
of
the
statute,
and
we
have
to
--
we
have
to
limit
this
in
some
fashion.
and
the
limitation
that
the
court
has
fashioned--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--well--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--respectfully,
justice
scalia,
i
think
those
words
came
from
your
dissent
in
that
case.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
no,
no.
no,
i
don't
say
that
they
were
wrong,
justice
scalia.
what
i
--
what
i
would
though
--
do
though
is
i
would
point
the
court
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
not
only
the
--
not
only
the
specific
statute
involved
here,
the
motor
carrier
statute,
but
there's
a
--
there's
a
twin
statute
that
applies
to
air
carriers.
and
it
also
applies
to
hybrid
air
and
--
and
motor
carriers.
and
i
apologize,
i
haven't
sent
up
a
text
of
this
statute
in
our
appendix
or
anything,
but
it's
--
it's
section
41713
of
title
49,
and
--
and
it
includes
very
similar,
general
--
broad,
general,
preemptive
language.
and
it
does
not
--
neither
of
those
--
those
provisions
in
41713
contains
limiting
language
that
--
that
--
that
would
limit
the
scope
of
preemption
in
any
way.
the
--
the
--
and
we
know
from
the
--
the
legislative
intent
with
regard
to
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
directly
that
congress
intended
that
the
scope
of
preemption
for
all
of
these
different
kinds
of
industries
would
be
coextensive.
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
with
this
statute,
was
to
give
motor
carriers
the
same
breadth
of
protection
through
preemption
that
air
carriers
enjoy
and
that
hybrid
air
and
motor
carriers
enjoy.
and
so
if
there
are
no
--
if
there
are
no
limitations
with
regard
to
air
carriers
and
--
and
hybrid
air
motor
carriers
of
--
of
the
type
that
are
suggested
by
my
friends
for
motor
carriers,
then
--
then
that
language
at
the
end
of
14501
can't
be
interpreted
in
a
--
in
a
strictly
limiting
fashion.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
well,
justice
breyer,
let
me
just
say,
first
of
all,
that
--
that
consumer
protection
is
--
is
--
i'm
not
sure
i
would
concede
that
consumer
protection
is
--
is
an
area
of
traditional
state
regulation.
in
fact,
the
new
hampshire
consumer
protection
law
dates
to
1970,
and
the
federal
government
has
largely
occupied
the
field
of
motor
carrier
transportation
since
1935
with
the
enactment
of
the
motor
vehicle
act
in
that
year.
so--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--that
is
what
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
said,
justice
sotomayor.
i
would
submit
that
--
that
that's
an
artificial
distinction
that
fails
to
take
into
account
the
broad
definition
of
“
transportation
”
in
federal
law.
if
the
court
has
no--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--well,
if
a
--
if
a
person
has
brought
their
vehicle
into
a
garage,
justice
ginsburg,
there's
been
no
transportation
by
a
motor
carrier.
the
difference
is
that
in
this
case
this
whole
scenario
started
out
with
a
transportation
by
a
--
by
a
motor
carrier
which
also,
once
it
had
possession
of
the
vehicle,
stored
it.
and
so,
in
a
garage
scenario,
i
suppose
if
a
tower
towed
the
vehicle
to
a
garage
and
then
left
it,
left
it
at
a
garage
to
be
worked
on,
that
--
that
garage
owner
wouldn't
be
in
a
position
to
say
that
i
can
assert
a
preemption
defense,
because
that
garage
owner
has
never
--
has
never
engaged
in
the
kind
of
transportation
activity
that
triggers
this
preemption
law.
i
hope
that
answers
the
question.
may
i
reserve?
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
thank
you.
let
me
take
a
couple
of
moments
to
try
to
address
some
of
the
questions
that
seem
to
be
troubling
some
of
the
justices.
justice
breyer,
the
simple
answer
to
why
local
traffic
safety
laws
wouldn't
be
preempted
is
that
there's
an
exemption
for
the
safety
regulatory
authority
of
states
in
the
statute.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
and,
justice
kagan,
the
reason
why
this
--
this
case
goes
over
the
line
and
is
preempted
is
because
what
the
plaintiff's
damages
claims
in
this
case
seek
to
do
is
they
seek
to
enforce
duties
that
go
well
beyond
what
even
the
new
hampshire
abandoned
vehicle
law
requires.
they
seek
to
impose
duties
of
reasonable
care
to
seek
out
the
owner
of
the
vehicle;
they
--
the
--
the
--
the
negligence
claim
seeks
to
impose
a
duty
to
act
--
a
duty
of
reasonable
care
in
disposing
of
the
vehicle;
and
--
and
a
duty
of
reasonable
care
to
return
the
vehicle
to
mr.
pelkey.
and
those
duties
and
what
has
been
a
breach
of
those
duties
will
be
determined
by
a
jury.
and
so
when
tow
truckers
are
faced
in
the
future
with
having
to
live
up
to
those
sets
of
duties,
they
will
never
know
whether
or
not,
in
any
given
situation,
their
conduct
will
be
second-guessed
as
having
been
not
reasonable
by
a
jury
and
they
will
be
subjected
to
damages
claims
by
plaintiffs.
under
the
--
the
abandoned
vehicle
law,
the
rule
is
very
simple
in
new
hampshire
and
under
--
and
in
many
other
jurisdictions
--
pay,
or
your
vehicle
can
be
sold.
it's
a
very
simple
rule.
and--
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
actually,
the
--
the
tower
here
wasn't
invoking
the
law,
the
tower
was
simply
following
what
the
law
says
in
terms
of
the
process.
this
is
a
mandatory
process.
when
--
when
a
person
comes
into
possession
of
another's
vehicle
in
new
hampshire
and
--
and
there's
no
claim
made
for
the
vehicle,
the
law
requires
that
the
tow
trucker
report
that
fact
to
the
department
of
motor
vehicles.
and
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
then
looks
at
the
information
that's
provided
and
then
instructs
the
tower
about
the
process
of
whether
or
not
the
vehicle
can
--
can
be
sold
without
notice,
or
if
it
--
if
notice
is
required,
what
notice
is
required.
mr.
andre
d.
bouffard
well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
new
hampshire
law
is
the
new
hampshire
law,
and
what
we
have
here
is
--
is
a
tow
trucker
that
was
just
making
a
good
faith
--
a
good
faith
attempt
to
comply
with
the
law.
and
if
--
if
tow
truckers
that
are
making
good
faith
attempts
to
comply
with
the
law
are
faced
with
consumer
protection
act
claims
and
negligence
claims
and
the
kinds
of
remedies
that
come
with
consumer
protection
act
claims,
that
will
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
business
of
these
motor
carriers.
