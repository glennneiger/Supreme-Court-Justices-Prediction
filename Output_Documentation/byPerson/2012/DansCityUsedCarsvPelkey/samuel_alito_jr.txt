what
difference
does
that
make?
suppose
there
was
a
towing
company
that
lawfully
towed
cars,
but
its
practice
was
to
hold
the
car
for
24
hours
and
if
it
wasn't
picked
up
they
would
immediately
sell
it
for
parts.
your
argument
would
be
that's
preempted
by
the
federal
statute?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
the
state
can't
regulate
that?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
all
right.
a
private
plaintiff
could
not
assert
a
common
law
negligence
claim
if
that
were
done?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
lawfully
towed,
sold
for
parts
within
24
hours
because
it
wasn't
picked
up.
justice

well,
if
that's
--
if
that
is
not
related
to
payment
for
services,
then
why
is
this
--
why
is
there
such
a
relationship
here?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
it
would
involve
a
payment
dispute
to
the
same
extent
as
this.
towed,
notice
sent
out
immediately,
wasn't
picked
up
within
24
hours,
sell
it
for
parts.
