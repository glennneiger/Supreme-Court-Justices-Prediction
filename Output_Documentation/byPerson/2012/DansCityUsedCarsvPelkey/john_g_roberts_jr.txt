chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
will
have
argument
next
in
case
12-52,
dan's
city
used
cars
v.
pelkey.
mr.
bouffard?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let's
say
you
park
your
tow
trucks
on
somebody
else's
parking
lot,
and
you
don't
pay
the
rent.
so
they
sell
your
tow
truck.
is
your
claim
against
your
landlord
preempted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
how
does
--
so
if
your
tow
truck
is
involved
in
an
accident,
is
that
--
and
a
suit
is
filed
for
negligence.
is
that
preempted?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
just
looking
at
the
statutory
language.
it
says,
you
know,
"related
to
a
service
of
a
motor
carrier
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property.
"
and
you
know,
your
motor
--
your
truck
is
involved
in
transporting
property.
that's
the
claim
against
you,
that
you
don't
--
you
don't
render
good
service
because
you're
negligent
in
a
--
and
it
just
seems
to
me
to
fit
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
if
you
adopt
as
broad
a
reading
as
you
adopt.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
shaughnessy?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
ignore
the
fact
that
part
of
what
tow
trucks
do
is
store
things.
i
mean,
it's
a
necessary
and
integral
part
of
the
motor
service,
the
transportation
of
property,
that
they
do.
and
regulation
of
the
storage
will
affect
the
services
that
they
provide.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
just
like
--
it's
not
just
like
storing
anything
else.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
isn't
too
--
i
mean,
this
is
a
provision
of
course
in
the
federal
aviation
administration
act.
whatever
rule
we
adopt
is
going
to
apply
to
air
transportation
as
well.
and
is
your
position,
for
example,
that
things
related
to
a
hangar
at
an
airport,
that
those
are
not
covered
by
this
at
all?
it
seems
to
me
that
there
the
connection
between
the
transportation
and
the
storage,
the
storage
of
the
airplane,
you
can
see
a
little
bit
more
clearly
how
that
would
affect
what
the
airplane,
you
know,
can
do.
a
lien
--
you
can't
take
the
airplane
out
of
the
hangar
because
you
didn't
pay
the
rent
or
whatever.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
yelin,
welcome.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
--
i
asked
your
friend
on
the
other
side
the
question.
storage
is
part
of
what
tow
trucks
do.
maybe
in
a
way
that,
you
know,
cross-country
trucks
don't.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
a
local
jurisdiction
who
figures
out,
well,
this
is
a
great
way
to
make
a
lot
of
money
or,
you
know,
to
give
--
or
the
other
way,
you
know,
you
can
charge
--
charge
a
lot
because
we
want
to
keep
subsidized
tow
trucks.
i
mean,
why
isn't
that
fairly
directly
related
to
the
service
they
provide?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean,
maybe
these,
but
you
can
easily
imagine
that
these
types
of
laws
would
be
subject
to
abuse
and
would
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
towing
company
and,
therefore,
on
the
transportation
of
property.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
now
we
only
--
now
we
not
only
have
to
decide
whether
this
type
of
law
is
related
to
it,
but
once
we
say
some
of
those
laws
might
be
and
some
won't
be,
depending
upon
the
impact
in
a
particular
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
every
law
doesn't
have
to
be
considered
in
its
application.
if
you
say
you
can't
speak
out
on
the
sidewalk,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
apply
it;
you
can
consider
that
law
absolutely.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
why
doesn't
this
one
really
whack
them,
though?
it's
treble
damages
and
all
that.
you
can
answer
my
question,
yes.
[laughter]
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bouffard,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
please.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
ginsburg
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-52,
dan's
city
used
cars
versus
pelkey.
