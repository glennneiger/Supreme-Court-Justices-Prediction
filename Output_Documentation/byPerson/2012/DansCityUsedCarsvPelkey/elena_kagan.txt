suppose,
mr.
shaughnessy,
that
the
new
hampshire
laws
were
more
onerous
than
they
are.
suppose
they
said
to
a
towing
company:
once
you've
towed
this
car
you
have
to
hold
on
to
it
forever.
or
suppose
they
said
to
the
towing
company:
you
have
to
hire
private
investigators
to
go
figure
out
who
owns
this
car.
would
any
of
those
be
preempted?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
yelin,
i
gave
mr.
shaughnessy
a
couple
of
hypotheticals
about
very
onerous
regulations
involving
storage
after
the
towing
that
might
very
conceivably
have
an
effect
on
the
tower,
drive
up
the
tower's
prices,
conceivably
even
drive
the
tower
out
of
the
market.
so
how
do
we
draw
the
line
as
between
this
and
those
kinds
of
things?
justice
elena
kagan
but
it's
a
process
that
allows
you
in
certain
circumstances
to
sell
the
car
and
to
take
the
money.
and
what
justice
ginsburg
is
suggesting
is,
you
know,
you
have
to
take
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
