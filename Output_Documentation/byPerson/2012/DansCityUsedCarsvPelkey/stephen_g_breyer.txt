justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
--
what's
your
point?
if
it's
not
part
of
the
towing
law,
then
it's
further
removed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
guess
you
could
have
thousands
of
claims
across
the
country,
millions
of
claims
where
there
are
all
kinds
of
towing
laws.
and,
you
know,
it
says
in
cambridge,
massachusetts
park
your
car
here
during
a
snow
emergency,
it
will
be
towed.
probably
every
northeastern
country
has
laws
like
that.
i
guess
there
could
be
millions
of
negligence
claims
when
the
thing
is
towed,
the
guy
broke
a
headlight.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
are
all
those
things
preempted?
i
would
be
amazed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
what's
the
difference
between
this
and
--
and
what
could
arise
any
day
of
the
week?
i
mean,
as
i
read
your
brief,
i
--
are
you
saying
that
all
the
northeast
statutes
that
say
your
car
will
be
towed
if
you
park
here
during
a
snow
emergency,
what
happens?
i
mean,
do
they
have
to
go
to
the
department
of
transportation?
boston
couldn't
function.
i
know
that
they
do
tow
cars.
i
don't
know
that
firsthand,
but
i've
seen
it.
[laughter]
so
how's
it
supposed
to
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
there
isn't
in
this
case,
but
i'm
curious
to
know
how
it
works,
because
it
seemed
to
me
from
what
you're
arguing,
all
the
abandoned
motor
vehicle
laws
and
all
the
snow
emergency
towing
and
everything
else
that
i
see
every
day
would
be
preempted
a
fortiori.
so
you
tell
me
how
it
all
works.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
there's
a
lot
of
language
in
the
majority
pretty
much
along
the
line
that
justice
scalia
said.
and
i
might
mention
that
point.
i
mean,
justice
ginsburg
wrote
the
majority,
and
she
said
the
reference
to
regulatory
authority
of
a
state,
which
is
a
different
reference,
i
agree,
should
be
read
to
preserve,
not
preempt
traditional
prerogative
for
the
state.
and
justice
white
said
previously
that
you
have
to
start
with
the
idea
that
this
is
--
historic
police
powers
of
the
state
are
not
going
to
be
superseded
by
the
act,
unless
it's
a
clear
manifest
purpose
of
congress.
so
i
guess
the
problem
is,
with
a
lot
of
the
other
things,
that
you
yourself
are
in
an
area
that
is
a
traditional
matter
of
state
regulation.
it
is,
in
fact,
regulated
in
a
way
that
applies
to
everybody.
it
is
indirectly
related
to
the
transport
itself,
and
that
it
takes
place
on
--
about
storage
that
took
place
after
the
event.
so
you
have
all
that
working
against
you.
now,
the
columbus
case
does
offer
some
hope
for
the
other
side,
i
would
think.
but
what
do
you
think?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
don't
lose
that.
i
will
ask
you
this
question
to,
which
favors
you
in
a
sense
but
i
want
the
answer
really
from
the
solicitor
general
who
may
know.
but
i'm
going
to
ask
it
to
you,
too,
because
you've
probably
both
thought
about
it.
he
may
have
--
they
may
have
some
experience
on
it.
if
you
start
talking
about
significant
effect,
without
those
last
words,
“
deregulatory
purpose
”
i
suddenly
worry
about
the
following:
that
every
city
in
the
united
states
depends
upon
towing
to
regulate
parking
within
the
city.
we
couldn't
function
without
it,
although
none
of
us
like
it.
we
know
that
it's
necessary.
and
certainly
a
law
that
provides
for
towing
does
directly
regulate
the
service
of
the
tow
truck.
it
says
do
it.
and
then
it
tells
you
when
not
to
do
it.
so
what's
the
--
what
happens?
is
every
traffic
law
in
the
united
states
involving
towing
suddenly
preempted?
i
can't
believe
that.
how
does
this
work?
so
there
is
much
more
significance
in
this
case
than
the
words
we
write,
perhaps,
than
in
the
particular
case.
and
now,
do
you
want
to,
in
light
of
what
my
concern
is,
add
anything
to
what
you
say.
and
you
may
not,
the
solicitor
general
might,
but
i'd
like
to
hear
anything
you
have
to
say
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
you
--
you
can
just
rest
on
that,
but
i'm
going
to
have
--
or
somebody's
going
to
have
to
write
an
opinion.
and
we
could
just
say
that,
but
i
--
i
don't
see
i
can
--
my
own
problem
is
not
being
able
to
have
an
intelligent
answer
to
that
without
having
some
answer
to
the
bigger
picture.
and
the
bigger
picture
seems
to
me
horrendously
important.
and
--
and
i
don't
know
what
that
answer
is.
you
seem
to
be
getting
there
with
the
words
“
deregulatory
purpose
”.
and
i
--
and
i
was
thinking
how
we
might
try
to
work
with
those,
but
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i
think
it's
much
harder
than
this
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
the
relationship
is
--
is
in
the
--
in
the
more
general
case
is
more
direct
to
the
tow
truck.
it
says
“
go
tow
”.
and
that's
--
that's
why
i
need
some
kind
of
bigger
picture.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we
have
a
statute
which
says,
if
you
park
your
car
here
for
more
than
3
hours,
you
will
be
towed,
okay?
and
as
part
of
that
statute,
though
we
don't
see
it,
there
is
an
arrangement
for
the
service
of
the
city
with
the
tow
truck
company,
which
says
when
the
parking
person
calls
you
and
says
--
the
meter
says
red,
yellow,
purple,
green,
you
are
to
go
there
and
tow,
okay?
doesn't
that
sound
as
if
it's
regulating
the
service
of
tow
trucks?
and
i
suspect
across
the
country,
there
is
some
variation
on
that
theme,
but
there
are
thousands
of
them.
and
since
the
words
--
i
would
be
repeating
it
--
the
words
of
this
case
may
affect
that
situation,
i
want
to
know
what
you
know,
which
may
not
be
very
much
--
i
don't
blame
you
--
about
that
broader
situation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
the
opposite.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they're
--
they're
very
attractive
places
except
in
the
winter.
but
a
--
a
motor
carrier
vehicle
--
a
service,
transportation
includes
related
to
the
movement
of
passengers
or
property.
related
to
the
movement
of
passengers
or
property.
so
we
have
these
words
“
related
to
”
again.
i
--
well,
you've
given
me
a
couple
of
ideas,
but
i
--
maybe
they'll
turn
out
not
to
be
relevant,
but
--
but
--
which
i
hope.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
me
we
have
two
choices.
in
morales,
since
i
can
mock
my
own
opinions,
i
wrote
at
the
end,
"it's
not
--
when
it's
too
tenuous,
remote
or
peripheral.
"
that's
singularly
unhelpful.
[laughter]
it
seems
to
--
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
you
were
right.
there
are
two
directions
you
could
go.
but
first
i
would
like
to
know,
it
seems
my
guess
is
it
is
universally
thought
by
cities
that
this
act
does
not
preempt
their
normal
parking
regulations.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
we
either
have
to
take
this
tenuous,
etcetera,
this
is
too
much,
this
isn't
too
much,
da,
da,
da,
or
you've
given
--
there
is
another
thought
being
thrown
out
and
that
is
you
relate
it
to
the
basic
purposes
of
the
deregulation
act
and
you
say
that
where
the
city
is
regulating
something
that
never
was,
could
not
be,
and
is
not
part
of
a
regulated
or
deregulated
market,
i.e.,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
matter,
then
it
is
not
preempted.
now,
do
you
want
us
to
take
that
approach?
should
we
punt
and
just
use
the
words
like
“
tenuous
”
or
--
and
if
we
take
the
implicit
suggestion,
what's
the
right
way
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
