justice
antonin
scalia
my
question
is
--
is
the
same
as
justice
breyer's.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
running
in
the
wrong
direction.
to
the
extent
you
say
the
case
doesn't
involve
new
hampshire's
towing
law
but
involves
just
its
general
consumer
protection
law,
it's
--
it's
even
further
distant
from
being
preempted.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
--
i
understand.
my
goodness.
suppose
a
vehicle
--
i
pay
for
somebody
to
tow
--
i
agree
that
somebody
will
tow
my
vehicle
and
i
will
pay
them
$100.
and
he
tows
the
vehicle,
puts
it
in
my
garage
and
says,
give
me
the
$100.
and
i
say,
ha,
ha,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
$100.
now,
do
you
think
that
that
general
obligation
under
state
law
to
pay
a
debt
that
you've
contracted
to
pay
is
eliminated?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
different
from
normal
consumer
protection
law?
i
--
i
don't
see
that
it's
so
much
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
--
it
includes
storage,
is
the
point
you
are
coming
to,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
definition
includes
storage.
you
think
it
means
--
it
means
storage
at
the
end
of
the
transportation?
suppose
you're
--
you're
a
company
that
moves
goods,
but
we
also
store
goods.
you
can,
you
know,
rent
--
rent
space
and
we
will
store
your
furniture
for
years.
if
that
company
picks
up
some
goods,
brings
it
to
its
warehouse
and
leaves
it
in
its
warehouse
for
3
years,
that
storage
is
covered
by
this
--
by
this
statute,
you
think?
see,
i
thought
the
storage
was
--
was
storage
in
the
course
of
the
transportation.
sometimes
when
you're,
you
know,
changing
the
mode
of
transportation,
going
from
trucks
to
ships
or
something,
you
have
to
store
it
temporarily
during
--
during
the
course
of
the
transportation.
that's
how
i
would
read
it.
but
you're
saying,
even
if
you're
a
storage
company,
if
you
pick
up
goods
and
bring
it
to
the
place
where
you
store
it,
that's
covered
by
--
by
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let
me
tell
you
how
we
--
it
seems
to
me
we've
limited
it
in
--
in
the
columbus
case,
columbus
v.
harrah's
garage
and
wrecker
services,
inc.
we
said
that,
"the
clause
--
the
clause's
limitation
to
motor
carrier
services
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property
massively
limits
the
scope
of
preemption
to
include
only
laws,
regulations,
and
other
provisions
that
single
out
for
special
treatment
motor
carriers
of
property.
"
and
here
you've
told
us
that
this
case
doesn't
involve
any
law
that
singles
them
out
for
--
for
special
treatment.
to
the
contrary,
it's
the
general
consumer
protection
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
want
us
to
eat
those
words,
they
were
wrong,
or
--
or
somehow
you
don't
come
within
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah.
[laughter]
i
forgot
that.
so
you
say
they
were
wrong,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
price
of
the
storage?
are
you
challenging
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
just
told
us
anything
that
significantly
affects
the
transportation
service
is
covered.
and
i
think
what
your
brother's
argument
is,
is
that
this
significantly
affects
the
service,
whether
he
can
collect
for
the
storage
after,
you
know,
after
the
--
after
towing
it
by
--
by
selling
it,
and
by
selling
it
on
terms
that
are
not
so
onerous
as
to
impinge
upon
his
--
his
ability
to
run
the
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
worried
that
it'll
be
preempted.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
mention
cambridge,
did
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you're
both
from
boston,
massachusetts.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
maybe
--
maybe
we
have
to
make
it
up,
what
the
limitation
--
i
mean,
you're
quite
right,
everything's
related
to
everything
else.
and
we've
had
trouble
with
the
same
--
the
very
same
words
with
erisa,
and
--
and
started
off
trying
to
give
it
its
--
its
apparent
meaning,
“
related
to
”,
and
we
finally
concluded
you
can't
do
that.
so
what
do
you
want
us
to
make
up?
what
kind
of
a
limitation
do
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--related
to
--
related
to
--
related
to
the
movement
of
the
property.
that's
the
problem.
it's
the
“
related
to
”
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
say
it
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
service
where?
justice
antonin
scalia
storage,
ah.
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
discover
that?
do
we
look
into
the
city
council
hearings
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
want
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
law
and
say
the
law
is
preempted
or
the
law
isn't
preempted.
don't
tell
me,
you
know,
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
this
or
that.
that's
not
something
i
am
able
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that's
factual.
but
whether
the
intent
of
the
city
council
was
this
or
that
is
not
factual.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
is
what
you
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
so
at
the
time.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
would
depend
upon
how
severe
the
consumer
protection
law
is,
is
that
right?
if
it's
a
consumer
protection
law
that
really
whacks
the
tow
truck
operator,
that
would
be
different
from
a
moderate,
benign
consumer
protection
law?
we
have
to
examine
each
consumer
protection
law
on
its
own,
is
that
it?
