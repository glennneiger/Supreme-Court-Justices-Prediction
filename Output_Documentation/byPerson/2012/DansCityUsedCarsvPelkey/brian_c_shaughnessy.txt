mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
transferring
title
and
disposing
of
mr.
pelkey's
car
against
his
will
and
not
compensating
him
for
the
loss
of
his
personal
property
is
not
a
service
of
a
motor
carrier
with
respect
to
transportation
of
property.
the
regulation
of
state-created
property
interests
is
a
field
of
traditional
state
regulation,
and
the
broad
sweep
advocated
by
dan's
city
used
auto
in
this
case
would
create
a
regulatory
vacuum
because
there
are
no
federal
laws
that
allow
the
sale
of
a
motor
vehicle.
now,
let
me
address
some
of
the
things
that
my
brother
has
argued
that
this
case
is
about
that
we
disagree
about.
my
brother
has
argued
that
this
case
is
about
payment.
this
case
is
not
about
payment.
mr.
pelkey
is
not
challenging
that
dan's
city
used
car
had
the
ability
to
tow
the
vehicle.
we
are
not
challenging
how
it
was
towed.
we
are
not
challenging
the
price
of
the
tow.
none
of
that
is
being
challenged,
and
those
are
all
the
services
of
a
motor
carrier.
let
me
also--
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
--we
are
not
challenging
the
price
of
the
storage.
there
was
a
reference
to
a
letter
that
i
had
sent
to
the
dan's
city
people
several
months
--
but
there
were
two
letters.
the
first
letter
was
actually
quite
close
to,
within
several
weeks
of
the
auction,
where
we
said,
no,
we
are
looking
to
pay
for
it.
the
other
letter
was,
i
think
in
june,
was
saying:
you
need
to
account
for
these
proceeds.
you
sold
the
vehicle
at
auction
and
there
is
equity
in
this
property;
you
need
to
account
for
these
proceeds.
so
we
didn't
challenge
the
storage,
but
that
brings
up
the
issue
raised
by
justice
sotomayor
with
respect
to
the
storage.
and
i
would
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
my
brother
with
respect
to
what
rsa
262
is.
rsa
262
talks
about
removed
vehicles.
it
actually
provides
the
authority
to
law
enforcement
to
remove
a
vehicle
that
might
be
in
a
public
way,
but
it
also
gives
the
authority
to
a
private
landowner
to
have
a
car
removed
that's
on
their
private
property.
it
does
not
relate
to
the
motor
carrier
services
of
a
tow
truck
operator.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
well,
we
would
say--
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
--well,
respectfully,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
say
that
storage
is
a
separate
service
altogether.
and
the
act
of
transportation
--
and
this
is
another
place
where
i
would
disagree
with
the
characterization
by
my
brother
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
“
transportation
”.
i
believe
the
definition
of
“
transportation
”
specifically
refers
to
a
“
motor
carrier
”,
meaning
a
person
providing
motor
vehicle
transportation
for
compensation,
but
also
relates
to
the
movement
of
the
passengers
and
the
property,
and
the
services
related
to
that
movement.
so
the
very
definition
that
applies
to
this
case
and
to
the
transportation
services
relate
to
the
movement
of
the
property.
here
the
movement
has
stopped.
and
the
storage
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case
is
precisely
the
storage
that
is
in
rsa
262,
which
is
the
storage
charges,
not
for
the
movement
of
the
property.
so
i
would
clarify,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
is
our
position
that
the
transportation,
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property
which
justice
scalia
has
aptly
pointed
out,
severely
limits
the
scope
of
this
preemption
statute.
the
services
of
the
motor
carrier
terminated
once
the
hook
was
off
the
tow
truck.
that
is
when
it
stopped.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
yes.
i
believe
it's
pointed
out
in
the
rowe
decision,
in
order
for
it
to
be
related
to
the
motor
carrier
service
you
have
to
either
directly
regulate
that
service
or
it
has
an
indirect
connection
with
the
service
that
significantly
affects
the
service.
in
your
example,
it
would
be
a
direct
regulation.
you're
actually
requiring
a
motor
carrier
to
actually
provide
a
service
that
the
marketplace
itself
wouldn't
provide
or
that
the
motor
carrier
would
not
otherwise
provide.
so
that
is
a
direct
regulation
or
an
example
of
directly
regulating
that
would
be
preempted
under
this
statute.
but
what
we
are
dealing
with
here,
the
storage
afterward,
is
not
that
motor
carrier
service.
and
i
do
believe
the
language
at
the
end
with
respect
to--
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
--the
direct--
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
--correct.
the
way
i
--
the
way
i
interpreted
the
hypothetical
is
the
state
is
then
saying
in
order
as
a
precondition
to
or
as
part
of
the
motor
carrier
service
of
transporting
or
towing
that
vehicle,
you
also
must
provide
this
other
service
over
here,
which
is
actually
one
of
the
problems
with
the
rowe
case
and
under
the
maine
state
statute.
under
maine
state
law
what
they
were
requiring
the
motor
carrier
to
do
in
rowe
was
actually
to
provide
the
verification
service.
and
so
that
was
a
direct
regulation
i
believe
that
this
court
found
under
rowe.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
well,
it
may
impinge
upon
his
ability
or
impinge
upon
how
much
he
can
collect.
it
may
impinge
upon
those
things,
your
honor.
but
it
doesn't
affect
the
service
of
the
motor
carrier
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
the
property
because
that's
the
movement
of
the
property.
certainly
getting
paid
is
an
important
part
of
the
service
that
anybody
provides,
but
that
is
getting
too
attenuated,
that's
getting
too
far
out.
that's
getting
towards--
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
--there
is
an
effect
there,
and
i
do
believe
that
this
court
started
drawing
that
line
actually
in
the
travelers
case.
and
when
the
travelers
case
looked
at
this
“
related
to
”,
that's
what's
causing
the
problem,
“
related
to
”
and
what
does
“
related
to
”
mean?
and
as
has
been
pointed
out,
if
you
actually
use
“
related
to
”
to
its
extreme,
everything
is
related
to
everything
else.
that
has
been
said
several
times
in
the
case
law.
but
“
related
to
”
in
travelers,
i
believe
in
that
case
the
court
looked
at
--
there
was
attention
to
that
type
of
broad
sweep
of
“
related
to
”
and
the
presumption
against
preemption,
which
says
we're
not
going
to
preempt,
but
“
related
to
”
seems
we
are
preempting
everything.
so
there
was
a
tension.
so
in
travelers
we
went
to,
well,
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
what
the
manifest
intent
of
congress
was
for
the
regulatory
scheme.
you
have
to
look
at
the
intent
of
congress,
and
certainly
the
best
place
to
look
for
that
intent
was
first
in
the
words
that
are
used.
but
once
we
are
looking
at
the
intent,
we
have
to
say
does
the
actual
thing
that
is
being
regulated
by
the
state,
and
they
are
putting
in
their
own
policies
by
direct
regulation
by
a
positive
enactment,
does
it
affect
or
significantly
affect
the
deregulatory
purposes.
and
i
believe
that's
the
line
that
was
adopted
in
rowe.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
well,
believe
--
i
believe
with
respect
to
rsa
262,
which
is
the
statute
that
is
in
this
case,
it
doesn't
require
a
tow
truck
company
to
do
anything.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
well,
i
think
it's
--
it
is
an
easier
case
in
this
case
under
the
faaaa--
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
--well,
i--
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
--i'm
getting
lost
in
the
“
go
tow
”
command,
if
you
will.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
well,
thank
you
for
the
out,
justice
breyer.
but
again,
i
--
i
--
the
reason
i'm
getting
lost
is
--
and
i
understand
the
--
the
example
having
to
do
with
the
city
of
cambridge
having
no
--
no
parking,
and
if
you're
there
for
3
hours,
that
allows
--
there
is
this
--
statutes
that
allow
the
tow
truck
operator,
the
motor
carrier,
to
go
and
collect
that
under
a
nonconsensual
tow.
and
a
nonconsensual
tow
is
a
special
animal,
unfortunately,
because
there
are
no
market
forces
in
play
there.
but
i
don't
believe
that
that's
affecting
the
motor
carrier
service.
there
is
nothing
that
forces
that
tow
truck
carrier
to
go
out
and
actually
undertake
that
tow.
and
if
they
do
undertake
the
tow
or
do
the
business
or
whatnot,
then
certainly,
they
would
be
under
whatever
obligations
that
the
state
has.
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
i
think
we
have--
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
--right.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
no.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
i
think
he
did
yesterday,
too,
your
honor.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
well
--
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
make
up
too
much
in
this
particular
case.
it
gets
easier
to
draw
the
line
because
of
the
with
respect
to
transportation
of
property.
so,
with
respect
to
the
faaaa
and
motor
carriers,
we're
drawing
the
line
as
to
only
the
services
of
the
movement
of
the
property,
and
that
is
limiting.
and
i
do
--
i
would
agree
with
your
dissent.
mr.
brian
c.
shaughnessy
correct.
and
then
we
go
back
to
the
instructions
in
rowe,
which
--
which
provided
the
framework
that
when
you're
interpreting
related
to,
you
go
1:
is
it
direct
--
directly
regulating
or
directly
affecting
service;
or,
if
it's
an
indirect
effect,
which
obviously
it
can
be,
it
has
to
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
services.
and
then
there's
the
ultimate
out
of
morales
that
says
if
it's
--
it
could
certainly
connect,
but
if
it's
too
far
attenuated
to
the
purposes
of
congress,
it's
just
not
going
to
be
done.
i
know
that
doesn't
help
with
the
line
drawing
in
--
in
connection
of
the
gray
area
that
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case,
but
i
do
believe
in
this
particular
case,
it
is
easier,
because
we
have
that
--
those
words
of
limitation:
"with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property.
"
are
words
of
limitation,
and
they
are
not
present
in
the
ada,
and
they
were
not
present
with
the
erisa
cases,
which
deals
with
a
broad
regulatory
scheme
with
long
history
and
other
things
that
apply.
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
i
believe
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
got
it
right
when
they
were
focusing
on
actually
what
is
a
service
of
a
motor
carrier,
and
i
believe
we
do
have
words
of
limitation
in
this
particular
case.
so,
what
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
said
is,
"the
manner
in
which
a
company
in
possession
of
a
towed
vehicle
may.
"
--not
must
--
"may
dispose
of
the
vehicle
to
collect
on
a
debt
created
by
the
operation
of
state
law
is
far
removed
from
congress's
aim
of
promoting
free
markets
and
equalizing
the
competitive
playing
--
playing
field
between
motor
carriers
and
air
carriers,
and
help
assure
transportation
rate
services
reflect
maximum
reliance
on
--
on
forces.
"
i
also
believe
that
the
petitioner
has
basically
given
up
the
case
and
conceded
the
case
in
several
places
in
their
brief
and
in
here
in
oral
argument
today.
if
you
look
at
page
34
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
it
says
that
most
--
that
"the
most
that
dan's
city
really
can
say
is
that
the
services
within
the
meaning
of
section
14501(c)(1)
includes
activities
that
are
incidental
and
distinct
from
the
actual
transportation
services.
"
so,
the
petitioner's
brief
is
calling
the
storage
afterwards,
after
the
transportation
has
stopped.
and
--
and
they
call
it
incidental
and
distinct.
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
21,
they
say,
"moreover,
criminal
laws
prohibiting
theft
are
not
the
kind
of
burdensome
state
economic
regulation
congress
sought
to
prevent
with
the
faaaa,
nor
are
abandoned
vehicle
laws
such
as
new
hampshire
chapter
262
in
its
regulations
which
do
not
hamper
the
operations
of
tow
truckers;
instead,
they
establish
procedures
for
the
efficient
handling
and
disposition
of
abandoned
vehicles.
"
so
they're
conceding
that
rsa
262
in
this
case,
the
statute
does
not
have
a
specific
impact,
so
this
is
not
a
clear
case.
i
see
i
have
more
time,
but
i
think
i've
made
all
my
points,
if
there
are
no
more
questions.
