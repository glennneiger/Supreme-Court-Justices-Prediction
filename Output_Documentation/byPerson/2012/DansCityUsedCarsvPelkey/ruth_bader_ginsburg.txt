mr.
bouffard,
this
law,
this
new
hampshire
law,
it
regulates
storage.
is
this
a
law
that
applies
only
to
the
towing
companies
who
tow
the
automobile
and
then
store
it,
or
does
the
law
apply,
say,
to
a
garage,
say,
someone
brings
a
car
to
a
garage
for
repairs,
and
does
this
storage
law
regulate
garage
operations
as
well
as
towing
operations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
--
so
it
would
apply
to
a
garage
operator.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
what
made
it
abandoned
was
that
they
tried
to
locate
the
owner,
couldn't
and
so
--
this
same
thing
could
happen
with
a
garage
owner
as
happened
to
the
towing
truck.
so
there's
nothing
peculiar
about
being
in
the
towing
business
that
makes
this
storage
application
--
storage
statute
apply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when?
when
did
that
opportunity
come
up?
because
i
thought
that
the
notice
didn't
get
to
the
--
to
the
plaintiff,
and
then
when
the
lawyer
said,
i
have
a
client,
it's
his
car,
then
the
towing
company
went
ahead
and
put
it
up
for
auction.
and
then
no
bidders,
so
they
sold
it,
pocketed
the
money,
gave
nothing
to
the
car
owner.
so
i
don't
understand
how
it's
a
dispute
about
payment.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
car
owner
said
i
won't
pay
for
the
towing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
what
point
did
pelkey
say,
i
won't
pay
for
the
towing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
why
should
the
tow
operation
be
treated
any
different
from
the
garage
when
they're
doing
the
identical
thing,
that
is,
storing
and
then
selling
the
vehicle?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
also
tells
how
the
vehicle
will
be
sold
--
sold,
and
your
client
is
invoking
that
statute
in
order
to
be
able
to
sell
the
car,
but
wants
to
have
enforced
only
the
parts
that
are
favorable
to
the
tow
operation.
and
the
--
the
regime
in
new
hampshire
is,
yes,
you
can
sell
the
vehicle,
but
this
is
how
you
do
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
not
how
it
was
done
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
concerns
the
preemptive
scope
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
authorization
act
of
1994,
its
acronym
f4a,
an
act
about
motor
carriers,
not
airplanes.
the
f4a
bar
state
laws
related
to
a
price,
route
or
service
of
any
motor
carrier
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property.
the
question
presented
is
whether
that
provision
precludes
state
law
claims
stemming
from
the
storage
and
disposal
of
towed
vehicles.
we
hold
it
does
not.
respondent
robert
pelkey
owned
a
honda
civic
which
he
parked
in
the
lot
of
his
apartment
complex.
tenants
were
required
to
remove
their
cars
in
the
event
of
a
snowstorm
so
the
snow
could
be
cleared.
when
it
snowed
heavily
in
february
2007
and
pelkey
failed
to
remove
his
car,
his
landlord
engaged
dan's
city
used
cars
to
tow
and
store
the
honda.
at
the
time
and
unknown
to
dan's
city,
pelkey
was
suffering
from
a
grave
medical
condition.
soon,
thereafter,
he
had
surgery,
suffered
a
heart
attack,
and
remained
hospitalized
for
two
months.
new
hampshire's
abandoned
motor
vehicle
law
allows
storage
companies
to
dispose
of
unclaimed
cars
if
efforts
to
locate
and
notify
the
owner
fail.
relying
on
that
law,
dan's
city
set
an
auction
date
of
pelkey's
car.
pelkey
learned
of
the
upcoming
auction
upon
his
discharge
from
the
hospital.
two
days,
prior
to
the
schedule
of
auction,
pelkey's
attorney
notified
dan's
city
that
pelkey
wished
to
reclaim
the
car
and
would
pay
charges
due
for
towing
and
storage.
dan's
city
nevertheless
proceeded
on
its
disposal
course.
attracting
no
bidders
at
the
auction,
dan's
city
traded
the
car
away.
receiving
no
proceeds
from
the
sale,
pelkey
sued
dan's
city
in
new
hampshire
state
court.
he
alleged
that
in
selling
his
honda,
dan's
city
failed
to
meet
requirements
of
new
hampshire's
abandoned
vehicle
law.
consequently,
pelkey
sought
damages
under
new
hampshire's
consumer
protection
act
and
common
law.
the
trial
court
granted
summary
judgment
to
dan's
city
holding
that
pelkey's
claims
were
preempted
by
the
f4a,
but
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
reversed
that
judgment.
the
f4a
does
not
preempt
pelkey's
suit,
the
higher
court
held,
because
his
claims
did
not
relate
to
the
transportation
of
property
or
to
a
motor
carrier's
service.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
the
f4a,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
preempts
state
laws
related
to
a
price,
route,
or
service
of
any
motor
carrier
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
property.
pelkey's
claims
are
not
preempted
because
they
do
not
concern
the
transportation
of
property.
he
seeks
redress
for
dan's
city's
disposal
of
his
vehicle
after
transportation
by
towing
had
ended.
pelkey
raises
no
objection
to
the
manner
in
which
his
car
was
moved,
nor
does
he
question
the
price
of
the
tow.
he
seeks
compensation
only
for
what
happened
once
the
car
ceased
moving
and
was
stored.
furthermore,
pelkey's
claims
are
unrelated
to
the
service
a
motor
carrier
offers
its
customers.
the
transportation
service,
dan's
city
provided,
was
the
removal
of
pelkey's
car
from
his
landlord's
parking
lot.
that
service,
which
did
involve
the
movement
of
property,
ended
months
before
the
conduct
of
which
pelkey
complains.
we
note
the
one-way
street
on
which
dan's
city
seeks
to
travel.
the
towing
company
relies
on
new
hampshire's
abandoned
vehicle
law
to
justify
selling
the
honda,
yet
it
would
stop
pelkey
from
invoking
that
very
same
law
to
demand
dan's
city's
compliance
with
owner
protective
provisions
of
the
law.
we
note
finally
that
via
the
f4a,
congress
sought
to
prevent
states
from
impeding
the
free
flow
of
trade
and
transportation
in
interstate
commerce.
state
law
claims
concerning
the
disposal
of
stored
vehicles
are
a
long
distance
from
congress'
driving
concern.
this
court's
decision
affirming
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court's
judgment
is
unanimous.
