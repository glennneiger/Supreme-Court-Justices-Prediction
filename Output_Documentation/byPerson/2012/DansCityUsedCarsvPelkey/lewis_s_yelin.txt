mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
deregulated
the
trucking
industry
to
eliminate
undue
interference
with
market
forces
and
consumer
choice.
but
market
forces
and
consumer
choice
cannot
operate
on
the
sale
of
nonconsensually
towed
cars,
and
there's
little
reason
to
think
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
state
laws
that
regulate
that
conduct.
this
court
in
this
case,
as
in
many
preemption
cases
involving
the
phrase
“
related
to
”,
must
engage
in
a
--
in
a
process
of
sensible
line
drawing.
everything
is
related
to
everything
else
in
the
literal
sense.
and
the
court
in
travelers
suggested
that
the
court
should
not
--
courts
should
not
use
uncritical
literalism
in
determining
the
scope
of
a
preemption
provision.
i
think
that
this
court
does
have
some
work
to
do
in
this
case,
but
a
lot
of
the
groundwork
has
already
been
laid
in
the
rowe
case.
in
rowe,
this
court
held
that
a
state
law
is
related
to
a
motor
carrier
service
if
the
state
law
either
directly
regulates
the
service
or
if
it
has
an
indirect
connection
with
the
service
and
a
significant
--
forbidden
significant
effect
on
congress's
deregulatory
and
preemptive
objectives.
i
think--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--it's
certainly
a
foreseeable
service
that
could
be
provided.
the
question
is
whether
it
has
a
sufficient
locus
to
the
transportation
itself.
i
think
there
are
indications
in
the
statute
itself
and
the
statutory
purposes
which
suggest
that
the
court
should
view
service
as
a
separate
type
of
service,
independent
and
distinct
from
transportation,
at
least
in
the
towing
context
where
the
motor
transportation
has
ceased.
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--yes,
sir.
i
think
that
there
are
reasons
in
the
statutory
text
itself
and
in
the
statutory
objectives
for
viewing
service
as
independent
--
excuse
me,
storage--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--i
misspoke,
justice
scalia.
storage.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
as
independent
of
transportation.
and
the
reasons
for
that
are
as
follows:
first,
let
me
start
with
the
statutory
text.
the
statute
defines
“
transportation
”
as
"services
related
to
the
transportation
of
property.
"
and
storage
has
been
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
over
100
years,
the
term
“
storage
”.
and
for
over
100
years
this
court
has
construed
disputes
concerning
storage
and
considered
whether
or
not
federal
law
governed
or
state
law
governed.
when
the
storage
was
before
delivery
of
a
package,
for
example,
the
storage
was
considered
to
be
storage
in
transit
and
it
was
part
of
the
transportation
itself.
but
if
the
storage
occurred
after
delivery,
that
was
a
separate
service
not
connected
with
the
transportation.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
so
i
have
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make
with
respect
to
that,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
i
think
the
hypotheticals
you
gave
are
much
more
difficult
cases
and
could
very
well
cross
the
line
if
a
state
tried
to
indirectly
influence
towers.
for
example,
let's
assume,
if
i
may
elaborate
on
your
hypothetical,
that
a
state
really
disliked
the
practice
of
nonconsensual
towing,
and
really
wanted
to
try
and
reign
it
in
and
so
imposed
certain
conditions
on
towers
that
would
discourage
them
from
engaging
in
this
particular
type
of
service.
i
think
that
would
be
an
indirect
type
of
regulation,
but
it
would,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
really
would
impair
the
ability
or
the
interest
of
towers
to
provide
this
service
to--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--i
think
in
part,
your
honor--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--your
honor,
i
think
some
of
these
preemption
questions
necessarily
are
factual
in
part
in
nature.
the
court,
to
consider
whether
or
not
a
service
of
the
motor
carrier
is
affected
by
an
indirect
statute
is--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--oh,
no.
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
that
would
be
part
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
no,
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether
it
would
have
that
effect,
that
factual
effect.
and
if
i
may,
i
think
it's
critical
in
this
case
to
point
out
that
petitioner
has
conceded
at
page
21
of
its
reply
brief
that
laws
like
chapter
262
do
not
hamper
towing
industry
practices.
and
respondent's
amicus
towing
and
recovery
association
explains
that
laws
like
this
provide
a
critical
backbone
for
nonconsensual
towing
services.
in
the
absence--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--and
if
there
were
such
abusive
laws,
your
honor,
and
if
they
do
impair
the
transportation
of
property
and
the
services
that
a
tower
was
willing
to
provide,
i
think
that
the
court
would
likely
consider
those
cases
and
consider
those--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--your
honor,
i
think
every
law
has
to
be
considered
in
its
application,
and
i
think
that,
for
example,
in
morales,
the
court
just
didn't
consider--
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
--fair
enough,
your
honor.
my
comment
was
too
broad.
what
i
would
say
is
some
laws
will
be
obvious.
those
that
directly
regulate
towing
industries,
for
example,
a
state
law
that
flatly
prohibits
nonconsensual
towing
would
be
the
type
of
direct
regulation
which
is
proscribed
by
this
preemption
clause.
when
you
are
talking
about
indirect
regulation,
however,
that
perhaps
is
where
i
think
one
needs
to
consider
it
on
an
as-applied
basis,
because
indirect
regulation
by
definition
is
not
going
to
have
an
obvious
direct
limit
on
towing
services
and
the
question
the
court
will
have
to
consider
is
whether
the
indirect
regulation
is
sufficiently
onerous
that
it
does
impair
the
provision
of
towing
services.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
you
are
right
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
your
honor,
i
think
the
two
alternatives
you
sketched
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
in
fact,
i
think
they
support
each
other.
i
believe
that
when
a
state
law
does
not
have
a
significant
effect
on
congress's
deregulatory
and
preemptive
objectives,
it
is
by
definition
going
to
be
too
tenuously
connected
to
the
motor
carrier
services.
i
would
propose,
your
honor,
that
in
this
context,
where
the
department
of
transportation
would
have
no
regulatory
authority
and
where
there
is
no
private
market
that
could
fill
the
vacuum
that
would
be
created
by
the
removal
of
state
laws
creating
the
structure
for
the
private
choices
that
are
undertaken
here,
this
would
be
a
prime
example.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
i
think
the
answer
has
to
be
yes,
justice
scalia.
in
morales,
for
example,
the
court
considered
the
application
of
the
consumer
protection
law
where
the
states
were
trying
to
use
specific
guidelines.
mr.
lewis
s.
yelin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
your
honor,
the
consumer
protection
act
claims
that
are
asserted
here
are
premised
on
chapter
262,
which
structures
the
background
organization
of
the
nonconsensual
towing
services
altogether.
there
will
be
no
treble
damages
if
the
substantive
provisions
wee
satisfied.
if
they
are
not,
that
would
be
a
different
question.
and,
your
honor,
there
has
been
no
evidence
suggested
here
that
in
fact
treble
damages
for
a
violation
of
the
background
laws
which
structure
the
standards
that
tow
truck
companies
are
supposed
to
undertake
would
have
that
harm.
