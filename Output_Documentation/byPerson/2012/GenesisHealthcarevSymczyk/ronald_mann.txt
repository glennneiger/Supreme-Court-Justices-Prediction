mr.
ronald
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
deprives
the
defendant
of
the
ability
to
free
itself
from
litigation
even
when
it
is
willing
to
pay
complete
relief
to
the
sole
plaintiff.
thus,
as
long
as
the
plaintiff
refuses
to
accept
full
and
complete
payment,
a
putative
collective
action
must
continue
onward
to
certification.
mr.
ronald
mann
that's
a
good
question,
justice
ginsburg.
because
it
was
an
offer
of
judgment,
if
the
offer
had
been
accepted,
the
result
would
have
been
a
judgment
by
the
federal
court
imposing
liability
under
the
statute,
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
on
the
defendant,
and
requiring
the
defendant
to
pay
full
and
complete
relief,
including
costs
and
attorneys'
fees,
to
the
plaintiffs.
so
there
would
have
been
a
judgment
of
the
federal
court
imposing
liability
under
the
statute.
mr.
ronald
mann
well,
i
think
there
is
rules
of
issuing
claim
conclusion
that
would
flow
from
the
judgment,
and
it
would
have--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
there
would
be
a
variety
of
fact
questions
that
would
have
to
be
resolved
to
determine
the
extent
of
the
preclusion
from
the
first
judgment.
but
the
rules
of
issue
and
claim
preclusion
would
apply,
and
to
the
extent
those
rules
call
for
matters
that
were
comprehended
within
the
judgment
to
bind,
in
a
later
case
they
would.
i
think
the
way
that
i
would
put
it,
looking
back
to
justice
kagan's
opinion
in
the
smith
v.
bayer
case,
it's
common
for
there
to
be
preclusive
effect
of
a
judgment
in
one
case
against
people
that
are
not
parties.
and
this
would
have
been
a
judgment
imposing
liability
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
based
on
the
allegations
made
in
the
complaint.
and
that's--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
let
me--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
rely
on
my
statements
here
to
say
that
we
would
have
accepted
judgment
of
liability
at
that
time.
the
--
the
offer
itself
was
a
formal
offer
of
judgment
on
a
form
promulgated
by
the
trial
court.
the
offer
itself
is
not
an
admission
of
liability.
the
offer
itself
is
not
a
judgment
against
the
defendant.
the
offer
is
a
statement
that,
under
the
ordinary
rules
for
rule
68,
if
--
if
they
accept
the
offer,
it
would
be
a
judgment
against
our
client.
mr.
ronald
mann
that's
detailed
later
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
77
to
79.
but,
essentially,
what
our
client
did
is
they
took
the
amount
of
time
for
breaks
during
the
respondent's
period
of
employment
and
offered
her
full
wages
for
all
of
the
break
time,
so
that
whatever
amount
of
break
time
was
appropriately
charged
for
her--
mr.
ronald
mann
--yes,
your
honor
--
yes,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
ronald
mann
okay.
so
there
is
two
things
i
want
to
say
about
that.
the
first
one
is
to
talk
about
what
happened
in
this
particular
case,
which
is
the
case
that's
before
the
court;
and,
the
second
is
to
discuss
the
practical
consequences
of
what
could
have
happened
in
some
other
case.
so
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
it
was
uncontested
that
the
offer
provided
complete
relief.
and
so
the
respondent
suffered
a
judgment
to
be
entered
against
her
because
of
the
conceded
acts
of
the
offer.
and
at
the
time
that
judgment
was
entered,
nothing
had
been
done
about
certification.
at
the
time
the
offer
was
entered
--
had
made,
nothing
had
been
done
about
certification.
so
what
we--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
i
think
there
is
two
questions
to
unpack
here
that
--
that
are
implicit
in
both
what
the
chief
justice
is
commenting
on
and
what
you're
commenting
on,
justice
ginsburg.
one
is
the
question
that
was
presented
in
the
petition,
which
is:
what
is
the
effect
on
a
collective
action
if,
before
certification
or
any
motion
for
collective
process
has
been
determined,
the
sole
plaintiff
loses
the
case.
the
second
one
is:
how
do
you
deal
with
the
housekeeping
issues
of
terminating
the
interest
of
a
plaintiff
when
there's
no
longer
controversy
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant.
and
so--
mr.
ronald
mann
--okay.
so
i
think
there
is
two
--
again,
there's
two
things
to
say.
one
is,
we
view
it
as
a
housekeeping
question
because
it
seems
to
us
clear
that,
if
the
defendant
no
longer
wishes
to
contest
liability
and
formally
offers
to
pay
all
of
the
relief
that
the
person
could
possibly
win
in
any
formal
litigation,
it
has
to
be
the
case
that
the
individual's
interest
is
moot.
now,
it
might
be
that
the
appropriate
response
is,
as
is
consistent
with
the
third
circuit,
is
that
the
district
court
should
just
dismiss
the
case,
because
if
the
person
won't
take
yes
for
an
answer,
the
federal
court
doesn't
need
anything
further--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
i
don't
think
our
position
depends
on
rule
68
at
all
for
the
mootness.
our
position
for
the
mootness
is
that
if
there's
no
further
controversy
about
the
relief
that
is
created
by
the
cause
of
action,
there's
nothing
more
for
the
trial
court
to
do--
mr.
ronald
mann
--there's--
mr.
ronald
mann
--i
think
--
i
think
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
taken
a
variety
of
approaches
to
what
i'm
characterizing
as
a
housekeeping
question
of,
if
there's
no
further
controversy
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
how
do
we
move
the
case
off
our
docket?
one
approach
which
is
followed
by
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
is
that
you
enter
a
judgment
against
the
plaintiff,
whether
they
like
it
or
not.
mr.
ronald
mann
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
--
you
enter
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
--
that
needs
to
be
clear
--
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff--
mr.
ronald
mann
--whether
they
want
a
judgment
or
not,
you
say:
here's
everything
you
asked
for;
you
must
take
it.
another
approach
is
to
say,
if
they're
willing
to
give
you
everything
to
which
you're
entitled
and
you
won't
take
it,
then
there's
no
reason
we
should
continue
to
adjudicate
your
case
because
there's
not
really
a
controversy.
mr.
ronald
mann
okay,
so
let
--
let
me
respond
to
that.
i
think
knox
flows
naturally
from
friends
of
the
earth,
and
i
think
they're
both
saying
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
the
--
what's
going
on
in
those
cases,
and
i
suppose
in
the
nike
case
from
last
month,
is
this
general
problem
of
a
defendant
is
faced
with
a
piece
of
litigation
and
they
no
longer
wish
to
contest
it.
if
the
action
seeks
prospective
relief,
it's
quite
difficult,
once
the
case
has
begun,
for
the
defendant
to
convince
the
court
that
they
are
going
to
change
their
conduct
in
a
way
that
moots
the
claim
for
prospective
relief.
and
this
court's
had
a
series
of
cases
and
has
often
not
been
convinced
of
that.
in
a
case
that
only
seeks
retrospective
relief,
it's
somewhat
easier
to
convince
the
court
of
that.
one
way
would
be
to
formally
offer
to
pay
everything
the
person
could
get.
what
happened
in
this
case
and
what's
before
the
court
is
simply
if
that
happens.
so
what
happened
here
is
there
was
an
offer
that
was
conceded
to
be
adequate
and
the
plaintiff
suffered
a
judgment
to
be
entered
against
her
on
the
premise
that
she
had
no
further
claim.
and
the
question
is
if
that
interest
is
gone,
which
has
been
conceded
at
all
stages
of
the
litigation
until
the
bottom
side
briefing
on
the
merits
in
this
court,
what's
the
consequences
for
the
collective
action.
and
so
what
the
parties
have
litigated
about,
because
this
was
conceded
repeatedly
over
the
course
of
several
years,
is
what
happens
when
that
interest
is
moot.
now,
we
believe
that
it
is
correct
that
a
defendant
faced
with
litigation
that
it
does
not
wish
to
contest
can
terminate
the
litigation.
mr.
ronald
mann
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
section
216(b)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
provides
compelling
guidance
for
the
case
that
the
court
of
appeals
ignored.
in
this
case,
because
it's
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
very
paragraph
you're
looking
at,
congress
has
opined
--
and
i'll
say
it's
only
an
opinion
because
the
lower
courts
ignored
it.
but
congress
at
least
has
opined
as
to
how
you
tell
when
people
that
are
not
yet
before
the
court
can
be
treated
as
relevant.
and
the
answer
is
the
non-party
plaintiffs
cannot
be
part
of
the
case
until
they
formally
opt-in--
mr.
ronald
mann
--the
statute
does
not
say,
if
a
plaintiff
files
a
case
and
alleges
that
other
people
are
similarly
situated,
the
case
shall
not
be
dismissed
until
the
court
has
proceeded
to
conclusively
determine
the
propriety
of
certification.
it
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
ronald
mann
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
flow
directly
from
this
court's
decision
in
geraghty.
the
first
question
would
be,
at
the
time
that
the
defendant's
interest
becomes
moot
who
is
a
party
to
the
case,
and
the
answer
would
be,
well,
there's
just
this
one
person.
the
next
question
would
be,
has
the
district
court
ruled
on
certification
in
a
way
that
could
have
erroneously
caused
the
mootness?
well,
the
answer
would
be
no
because
it
became
moot
not
because
of
an
erroneous
district
court
ruling
on
certification,
which
was
the
situation
in
geraghty--
mr.
ronald
mann
--it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
what
geraghty
turns
on,
and
--
and
i
encourage
you
to
look
at
the
portion
of
footnote
11
that
--
the
last
two
paragraphs
of
that
footnote
that
goes
over
onto
page
407,
the
court
emphasizes,
all
we're
saying
here,
all
we're
saying
here
is
that
if
the
basis
of
mootness
is
an
error
by
the
district
court
and
if
we
later
ascertain
that
error,
we
will
not
only
correct
the
error
about
certification,
but
we
will
forgive
the
mootness
that
flowed
from
that
error.
in
this
court
case,
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
district
court
error
caused
mootness
to
occur.
mr.
ronald
mann
i
think
that
--
that
those
cases
provide
a
way
to
analyze
that
situation.
so
one
possibility
is
that
the
district
judge
grants
certification
at
some
moment
after
the
plaintiffs
filed,
and
then
later
in
time
the
sole
person
who
is
in
the
case
at
that
time
loses
their
interest
in
the
case
for
one
reason
or
another--
mr.
ronald
mann
--there
is
doubt
in
that
case.
and
we
would
suggest
that
it's
clear
that
it
doesn't
go
forward.
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
as
opposed
to
rule
23,
which
was
at
issue
in
geraghty,
even
after
the
district
judge
signs
an
order
saying,
pursuant
to
justice
kennedy's
opinion
in
hoffman,
we
should
send
notices
out
to
see
if
we
can
find
some
new
plaintiffs,
if
none
of
those
people
have
yet
appeared
before
the
court
and
signed
into
the
case,
there
is
still
only
one
plaintiff.
so
in
geraghty,
it
was
important
to
the
court
that
when
the
case
got
here,
although
the
interest
of
the
named
prisoner
had
been
vitiated,
there
were
several
people
who
had
filed
motions
to
intervene.
and
so
it
appeared
that
at
all
times
there
were
other
people.
in
this
case,
by
contrast,
there's
every
reason
to
think
that
after
the
person's
interest
was
vitiated,
there
were
no
other
plaintiffs
because--
mr.
ronald
mann
--so
again--
mr.
ronald
mann
--okay.
so
i
would
say
two
things.
the
first
thing
is,
of
course,
the
plaintiff
did
not
challenge
the
use
of
the
offer
in
the
trial
court.
the
second
thing
responsive
to
your
question
on
the
merits
is,
trial
courts
have
considered
this
question,
have
generally
considered
that
the
offer
is
admissible
by
analogy
to
rule
408,
which
deals
with
settlement
discussions
more
generally,
and
the
advisory
committee
notes
discuss
this.
and
the
general
idea
is
the
offer
is
being
admitted
for
a
purpose
other
than
to
prove
the
validity
or
amount
of
the
disputed
claim,
and
so--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
i
think
that
the
offer
is
not
being
admitted
to
prove
the
validity
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
or
the
amount
of
the
plaintiff's
claim.
the
offer
is
being
admitted
to
prove
that
the
plaintiff
has
no--
mr.
ronald
mann
--if
the
plaintiff
accepts
the
offer,
then
the
district
judge
will
enter
offer
--
will
enter
judgment
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
amount
of
the
offer.
the
district
courts
that
have
considered
this
have
ordinarily
concluded
that,
in
cases
where
the
offer
is
not
accepted
and
the
defendant
contends
that
the
offer
is
complete,
that
the
offer
can
be
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
there
is
no
controversy
between
the
parties,
which
is
distinct
from
admitting
it
for
the
purpose
of
proving
the
validity
or
amount
of
the
claim.
mr.
ronald
mann
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and
so
the
problem
that
we
face
here
is
the
--
the
questioning
relates
to
something
that
was
not
disputed
below.
and
our
position
is
a
relatively
simple
one,
which
is
that,
under
the
doctrine
of
mootness,
it
has
to
be
correct
that
if
there
is
not
a
controversy
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
about
a
cause
of
action
that's
authorized
by
law,
then
the
case
is
over.
and
that
was
all
conceded
below.
the
plaintiff
suffered
a
judgment
to
be
entered
against
her.
she
did
not
challenge
that
judgment
on
appeal.
mr.
ronald
mann
we
think
that's
the
appropriate
response.
we
think
that
what
should
happen
is
that
if
the
defendant
makes
an
offer
of
judgment
and
--
and
files
a
motion
to
dismiss
suggesting
that
it
provides
complete
relief,
that
if
the
plaintiff
doesn't
concede
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed,
the
district
judge
should
hold
a
hearing,
as
the
district
judge
did
here--
mr.
ronald
mann
--the
proceeding
isn't
under
rule
68.
mr.
ronald
mann
the
proceeding
is
under
rule
12(b)
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
because
the
case
is
moot.
see,
we
don't
think
that
it
matters
that
the
offer
happened
to
be
made
under
rule
68.
there
are
obvious--
mr.
ronald
mann
--but
we
don't
think
that
the
mootness
of
the
case
flows
from
rule
68.
the
mootness
of
the
case
flows
from
the
fact
that
there
is
not
a
dispute
between
the
parties
about
anything
a
federal
court
can
handle.
mr.
ronald
mann
but
the
court--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
because
the
plaintiff
didn't
accept
the
offer.
one
course
of
action
is
we
make
an
offer
under
rule
68,
and
the
plaintiff
says,
all
right,
let's
have
a
judgment
under
rule
68,
in
which
case
there
would
be
a
judgment
under
rule
68.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
said,
i'm
not
interested
in
rule
68.
and
we
said,
all
right.
well,
now
what
we
see
is
a
cause
of
action
under
federal
law
congress
has
created
that
specifies
certain
forms
of
relief
that
are
available
to
the
plaintiff.
and
in
this
case
there
are
damages,
some
liquidated
damages,
some
attorney's
fees
and
costs.
there
is
no
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief.
and
we
have
a
defendant
that
is
willing
to
give
more
than
you
could
possibly
get
if
you
win.
mr.
ronald
mann
yes.
yes,
there
were.
the
offer
specifically
provides
for
attorney's
fees.
and
even
if
the
offer
didn't
provide
for
attorney's
fees,
they
would
be
avail
under
section
216(b)--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
i
think
there
could
be
constitutional
objections
depending
on
the
details
of
the
statute--
mr.
ronald
mann
--i
think
the
constitutional
issues
that
proposals
like
that
might
raise
would
flow
from
the
decision
in
vermont
agency.
and
the
question
has
to
be
whether
there
is
a
person
before
the
court--
mr.
ronald
mann
--i
think
the
problem
is
in
that
case
there
is
an
identifiable
person
to
substitute.
in
this
case,
it's
not
substituting
somebody
for
the
plaintiff.
it's
leaving
the
federal--
mr.
ronald
mann
--the
problem
in
this
type
of
case
would
be
that
the
federal
proceeding
would
be
moving
along
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
with
no
plaintiffs,
and
the
district
judge's
role
would
be
simply
to
assist
the
plaintiff
in
trying
to
find
--
plaintiff's
counsel
in
trying
to
find
new
plaintiffs.
mr.
ronald
mann
on
that
note,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
ronald
mann
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
most
useful
thing
to
do
is
to
address
the
point
that
justice
breyer
has
raised
several
times
because
i
think
it's
important
to
discuss
the
relationship
between
what
i
would
call
the
statutory
facts
and
the
constitutional
questions
that
they
might
raise.
and
so
i
do
think
it's
fair
in
a
sense
to
think
about
this
as
a
statutory
case.
when
a
plaintiff
files
suit
in
a
federal
court,
often
the
cause
of
action
rests
on
a
statute
that
congress
has
adopted.
those
statutes
have
a
lot
of
attributes
that
congress
can
control
to
make
it
easier
or
harder
for
a
defendant
to
make
an
offer
of
complete
relief.
they
can
provide
for
mandatory
seeking
of
attorney's
fees,
as
this
one
does.
they
can
alter
the
rules
for
shifting
costs,
as
perhaps
the
fair
debt
collection
practices
act
does
from
last
month.
they
can
provide
for
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief,
which
makes
it
basically
impossible.
but
congress
gets
to
decide,
when
they
write
a
statute,
whether
they
want
to
make
it
a
statute
for
which
it--
mr.
ronald
mann
--well,
that
leads
me
to
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make,
which
is
exactly
what
is
the
constitutional
problem.
and
i
think
the
way
to
get
to
it
is
when
my
colleague,
mr.
katyal,
refers
to
the
worst
that
happens,
well,
the
worst
that
happens,
i
think
it's
--
it's
important
to
understand
what
the
worst
thing
is
that
happens.
the
worst
thing
is
--
that
happens
is
the
case
is
on
the
docket
of
the
federal
district
judge,
and
there
is
no
plaintiff
with
an
interest.
and
the
procedure
in
the
district
court
is
we
should
spend
some
time,
have
some
discovery,
look
around
to
see
if
we
can
find
another
plaintiff.
and
so
i
think
that
that's
a
different
problem
from
how
the
district
court
should
decide
the
order
of
hearing
--
of
deciding
motions.
if
the
problem
is--
mr.
ronald
mann
--so
i
spoke
unartfully
before.
obviously,
there
is
a
difference
between
claim
preclusion
and
issue
preclusion.
and
what
i
was
attempting
to
say,
unartfully
i
will
agree,
was
the
extent
of
preclusion
will
depend
on
the
issues
that
are
actually
litigated
in
the
proceeding.
and
so
i
don't--
mr.
ronald
mann
--claim
preclusion
is
going
to
apply
because
there's
a
judgment
by--
mr.
ronald
mann
--but
it
is--
mr.
ronald
mann
--but
in
this
particular
case,
there's
no
further
dispute
likely
to
occur
between
these
parties.
these
--
she
no
longer
works
for
us.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
she
is
going
to
work
for
us
again.
the
court
has
extended
the
capable
of
repetition
and
--
review
to
class
actions
in
three
cases:
gerstein,
riverside,
and
swisher.
but
in
those
cases,
what
happened
was
the
plaintiff
sought
prospective
injunctive
relief.
the
case
became
moot.
if
the
court
has
held
that
those
cases
were
outside
of
article
iii,
the
result
would
have
been
that
the
defendant
could
have
been
engaging
in
the
conduct
that
allegedly
violated
federal
law
and
would
never
have
had
to
change.
in
this
case,
what
happened
--
in
this
case
and
in
the
cases
like
this,
what
happens
is
someone
seeks
purely
prospective
--
retrospective
relief
for
something,
an
injury
that
is
complete.
except
for
their
attorneys,
she
would
have
received
complete
relief.
we
didn't
engage
in
our
conduct
any
longer.
