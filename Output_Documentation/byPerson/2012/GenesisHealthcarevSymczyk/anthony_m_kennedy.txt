let
me
ask
you
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
ask
you
just
this
question.
just
tell
me
as
a
matter
of
common
practice,
do
district
courts
enter
judgments
against
plaintiffs
routinely
when
a
full
offer
of
settlement
has
been
made
and
the
defendant
just
is
silent?
i
mean,
does
this
happen?
i
just
can't
remember
seeing
a
--
but
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
may
be
that
it's
common
practice,
if
the
plaintiff
doesn't
reply
and
there's
an
offer
that's
filed
with
the
court,
the
court
says,
i
haven't
heard
anything,
i'm
going
to
enter
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
a
matter
of
housekeeping,
you
could--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
offer
says
you
hereby
offer
to
allow
entry
of
judgment
under
rule
68.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
from
justice
alito
was,
what
happens;
does
the
court
have
authority
to
have
a
hearing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
said,
oh,
well,
this
is
not
under
rule
68;
but,
you
offered
to
allow
entry
of
judgment
under
rule
68.
and
incidentally,
you
never
did
follow
up
and
say
that
you
wanted
an
entry
of
judgment.
you
just
wanted
a
dismissal.
and
that's
another
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
take
this
case
on
the
premise
that
you
would
have
objected
if
a
judgment
had
been
entered
in
your
favor
for
the
full
amount
plus
attorney's
fees?
