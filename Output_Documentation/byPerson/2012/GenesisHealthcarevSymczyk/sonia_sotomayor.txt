justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
so
what
am
i
to
make
of
your
transmittal
letter
which
says,
in
the
offer
itself,
that
--
ja
5556,
that
petitioners
make
clear
that
the
offer
of
judgment,
quote,
"was
not
to
be
construed
as
an
admission
that
petitioners
are
liable
in
this
action
or
that
respondent
has
suffered
any
damage?
"
what
--
what
are
we
to
make
of
that--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--when
you're
now
claiming
that
you
would
have
accepted
a
judgment
of
liability?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
did
you
pick
the
$7,500?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
see
in
the
--
in
the
flsa
that
it
also
requires
an
amount
for
liquidated
damages.
did
you
include
that
amount
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
i
have--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--counsel,
can
i
ask
a
fundamental
question
under
rule
68?
when
i
was
a
district
court
judge,
if
parties
told
me
about
their
settlement
discussions
i
would
get
quite
upset.
but,
it
says
explicitly
--
explicitly:
"evidence
of
an
unaccepted
offer
is
not
admissible
except
in
a
proceeding
to
determine
costs.
"
what
authorizes
you
to
use
evidence
of
that
offer
to
argue
anything--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--especially
when
the
statute
gives
the
plaintiff
an
absolute
statutory
right
to
refuse
it
at
a
specific
penalty?
what
permits
you
to
use
it
as
evidence
of
anything,
mootness,
i
don't
care
what
you're
using
it
for,
except
in
cost?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
have
a
question
for
you,
counsel.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
there
is
--
from
the
beginning,
you
never
accepted
the
offer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
you
appear
to
have
conceded
and
--
is
that
the
amount
of
the
offer
would
settle
your
personal
claim.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
mr.
katyal,
i'm
a
little
troubled
that
you
have
given
up
or
argue
that
the
ability
to
enter
a
forced
judgment
is
permissible
under
rule
68.
there
is
nothing
in
that
rule
that
gives
the
court
that
power,
certainly
not
stated
explicitly
or
even
implicitly,
because
it
talks
about
an
entire
procedure
of
accepting
the
offer
or
rejecting
it,
all
of
it
in
the
hands
of
the
parties,
none
of
it
until
the
entry
of
the
judgment
in
the
hands
of
the
court
and
only
after
the
plaintiff
has
accepted
the
offer
in
writing.
so
i
can't
see
anything
but
an
inherent
power.
so,
for
me,
if
there
is
an
inherent
power,
it
has
to
be
under
a
default
judgment
because
the
other
side
is
saying,
“
i
give
up
”.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
go
from
there,
at
least
with
me,
and
that
may
answer
an
earlier
question
about
an
inquest
on
damages,
because
that
is
a
part
of
the
requirements
for
a
default
judgment,
so
that
if
there
is
a
dispute
about
damages
that
can
be
resolved.
but
my
point
is
that
liability
is
admitted.
now
let's
deal
with
the
chief's
question
and
justice
scalia's
question,
which
is
in
what
ways
is
this
comparable
to
a
shared
cost
like
what
motivated
our
decision
in
class
actions,
that
the
settlement
of
one
existing
plaintiff
doesn't
settle
the
collective
action.
how
is
this
similar
to
that?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--to
get
the
point
--
the
court
had
to
evaluate
whether
the
offer
actually
met
your
personal
damages
claim,
too.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
what
you're
saying--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--in
those
pages
is
the
court
didn't
even
do
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
what
you're
talking
about
is
imputing
into
this
process
a
fairness
hearing,
essentially,
to
see,
by
the
district
court,
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
quirky
case
where
you
entered
a
judgment
and
you
don't
need
collective
action
or
whether
or
not
this
is
a
genuine
case
that
requires
joining
plaintiffs.
