justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this,
i
take
it,
is
a
statutory
case,
not
a
constitutional
case.
that
is,
do
you
have
any
constitutional
objection
if
congress
had
said
in
216(b)
that
joe
smith
and
other
people
similarly
situated
to
miss
laura
symczyk
have
a
genuine
dispute
with
the
employer,
and
the
way
they
file
their
case
is
miss
symczyk's
case
will
be
deemed
to
be
their
case
as
well,
though
it
ceases
to
be
their
case
unless
they
confirm
within
60
days
of
such
and
such
in
writing
that
it
is
their
case.
if
congress
passed
that
statute,
there
couldn't
be
a
constitutional
objection
to
it,
could
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at?
in
other
words,
if
congress
had
explicitly
said
in
216(b)
that
the
third
circuit's
procedure
is
the
correct
procedure
for
mr.
joe
smith
to
bring
his
case
in
such
circumstances,
if
they
had
said
that
explicitly,
is
there
a
constitutional
objection;
if
so,
what
could
it
be?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
we
know
at
least,
since
we
are
doing
--
i
looked
up
a
little
bit,
but
article
iii
is
what
was
a
case
or
controversy
in
westminster
in
1788
or
1750
or
whenever,
that
in
westminster,
in
a
court
of
equity,
i
found
at
least
two
instances,
a
person
dies,
there
is
no
case
with
that
person,
but
it
remained
in
equity
on
the
docket
until
the
other
person,
the
estate,
came
in.
a
woman
could
not
bring
a
case
if
she
was
married.
she
starts
as
a
single
person.
she
gets
married.
lo
and
behold,
the
case
remains
on
the
docket
until
her
husband
comes
in.
that's
not
a
happy
example,
but
nonetheless
it's
in
point.
now,
i
could
find
nothing
the
other
way,
so
i
thought
of
the
canon
of
interpretation
that
equity
deems
to
have
been
done
what
ought
to
have
been
done,
or
something
like
that.
others
on
the
court
--
but
the
--
the
point
is
that
there
are
instances--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what?
yes.
it
remained
on
the
docket
in
the
westminster
courts,
even
though
there
was
no
plaintiff.
so
i
would
ask
you
again,
is
there
any
counter
example?
is
there
any
instance
from
equity
or
elsewhere
where
there
is
a
constitutional
objection,
had
they
said
it,
at
which
point
our
question
is
have
they
said
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it's
mr.
joe
smith,
if
he
confirms
it
in
writing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you're
interpreting
--
i
think
it's
true
that
we're
interpreting
the
statute,
and
--
and
i'm
trying
to
look
at
what
document
are
we
interpreting?
is
there
a
different
rule
or
a
different
--
what
--
what
rule?
so
i
could
come
back
to
the
statute.
and
congress
could
deprive
--
could
provide
exactly
the
system
that
you
suggest.
i
don't
see
anything
unconstitutional
about
it.
but
isn't
it
a
little
hard
to
read
this
statute
as
providing
that
mechanism,
since
what
it
says
is
no
party
shall
--
no
--
you
know,
it
says
what
it
says
in
the
last
two
sentences.
how
do
we
read
that
to
foresee
the
mechanism
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
says
the
difference
in
the
class
action
context
is,
in
the
class
action
context
you
can
consider
them
there,
but
there
isn't
a
specific
sentence
somewhere
in
a
statute
which
says
no
one
shall
be
a
party
unless
he
signs
in
writing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why?
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
that's
--
why?
why
is
my
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
does
that
differ
from
an
employee
who
says
--
he
is
annoyed
for
a
variety
of
reasons
at
the
employer
and
he
sues
the
employer
for
his
pay,
for
his
pay
for
the
month
of
october.
the
employer
says:
he
got
his
pay;
i
--
i
sent
him
the
check;
i
mean,
he
gets
it
every
month.
and
he
says:
yes,
but
i
didn't
cash
the
check.
is
there
a
case
for
controversy?
he
can
go
sue
for
his
paycheck
that
he
didn't
cash?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
so
why
is
it
any
different
when
the
--
the
defendant
employer
says,
here's
the
check.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he
says:
oh,
i
didn't
cash
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
we
have
a
case
if
the
employer
for
some
reason,
a
mistake
in
bookkeeping
or
something,
didn't
send
the
check
on
time,
so
it
arrived
3
days
late.
and
he
says:
ha,
i'm
not
cashing
the
check;
now
i
can
sue
him.
right?
that's
your
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
he
--
he
--
it's
a
contract.
you
know.
he
--
he
is
paid
every
month,
the
end
of
the
month.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
the
--
the
employer
gave
him
the
paycheck.
he
just
didn't
cash
it.
plus
the
damage
is
for
the
3
days.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
that's
true.
and
so
what
we
would
be
reading
into
this
statute
is
a
relation-back
doctrine,
which
happens
every
day
of
the
week
in
class
action
cases
and
has
historical
analogies.
so
i
understand
the
difference
you're
pointing
to,
but
why
not
read
that
in?
it
would
be
fair,
and
it
would
get
the
job
done
that
congress
sets
up
in
the
statute.
that's
the
argument
the
other
way.
