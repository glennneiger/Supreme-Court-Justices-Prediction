chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-1059,
genesis
healthcare
v.
symczyk.
mr.
mann.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
what
if
the
district
court
--
this
proceeding
--
you
filed
the
suggestion
of
--
of
mootness,
whatever,
and
the
judge
says,
okay,
i
have
this
suggestion
of
mootness;
i
also
want
to
address
the
certification
issue;
the
mootness
argument
is
scheduled
for
three
months
down
the
road,
the
certification
issue
for
two
months
down
the
road;
isn't
this
just
a
question
of
what
order
the
district
court
wants
to
address
these
two
issues?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
counsel,
i
don't
know
that
you've
answered
my
question
sometime
ago,
but
what
--
if
the
judge
can
simply
order
the
two
determinations
in
a
way
that
certification
is
addressed
before
mootness,
does
that
take
care
of
your
problem?
obviously,
if
you
grant
certification,
there
is
an
ongoing
controversy.
and
under
roper
and
geraghty
if
you
deny
certification
the
relation
back
doctrine
applies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
there's
no
doubt
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
there's
no
doubt
that
that
--
in
that
situation,
the
case
goes
forward,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
what
do
you--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
katyal.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
waived
that
argument.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no
--
did
you
waive
it
or
not?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
was
not
the
way
the
case
was
presented
in
the
body
of
the
petition
and
i
would
suppose,
if
that
were
your
objection,
that
it
wasn't
received,
wasn't
accepted,
we
might
have
heard
about
that,
as
you
suggest.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
if
in
fact
we
thought
we
were
dealing
with
a
case
in
which
the
rule
68
offer
was
not
accepted,
we
might
have
thought
differently
about
whether
to
grant
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
rely
on
the
question
presented.
your
reformulated
question
doesn't
have
that
feature
in
it.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what,
what
benefit
does
this
--
why
are
you
arguing
so
much?
you
will
have
an
entry
of
judgment
in
the
favor
of
your
client
who
is,
according
to
you,
simply
situated
to
lots
of
others.
why
don't
you
just,
if
somebody
comes
forward,
just
take
them
in,
go
in,
you
get
a
check
for
$7500
or
whatever
it
is,
you
get
attorney's
fees,
and
you
can
do
that
as
often
as
you
want?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
know.
but
that's
the
fortuity
of
the
fact
that
she
didn't
accept
the
offer,
and
we
are
dealing
perhaps
with
a
case
on
the
record
as
presented
to
us
where
she
did
accept
the
offer,
if
you
waive
that
argument.
so
assume
the
case
where
the
offer
is
accepted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
matter
in
terms
of
what
the
judge
is
supposed
to
do
with
your
motion
to
certify
if
nobody
else
is
in
the
case?
i
mean,
isn't
that
one
of
the
factors.
i
don't
know
if
it's
even
a
sort
of
good-faith
pleading
if
--
if
--
you
want
certification,
but
there
is
no
nobody
else
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
we'll
hear
from
mr.
yang
now.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
you
think
there
is
a
live
case,
not
if
he
doesn't
cash
it,
but
i
guess
as
justice
breyer
was
asking,
if
it's
a
day
late?
you
--
you
said,
well,
there
was
a
past
injury,
it
was
a
day
late,
it
--
it,
you
know,
could
be
redressed
by
telling
him
what?
pay
him
again?
or--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
you
would
also
have
what's
usually
known
as
no
injury.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
think
a
court
has
to
go
through
the
whole
process
of
a
trial
if
the
check
is
a
day
late
and
the
employer
says,
i'm
sorry,
here's,
you
know,
whatever
the
interest
is
on
the
check?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
could
you
directly
answer
my
question
about--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
or
the
plaintiff
says
no
--
no
standing.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
--
and,
as
we've
said,
at
every
stage
of
the
litigation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
you're
due
--
if
you're
due
$100
from
your
employer,
it's
a
day
late,
he
gives
you
$100,
and
he
says,
well,
here's
another
dollar
for
interest,
that,
as
you
said,
doesn't
eliminate
the
past
injury?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
mann,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
thomas
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1059,
genesis
healthcare
versus
symczyk.
