justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mann,
could
i
come
back
to
your
response
to
the
question
of
knox,
the
statement
in
knox
that
--
you
know,
where
the
court
can
issue
--
can
provide
no
relief,
there
is
--
there
is
no
standing.
that
--
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
to
that
is
--
is
not
--
i
mean,
you
--
you
answered
it
on
the
facts,
but
that
statement
was
not
meant
to
be
exclusive,
that
that's
the
only
situation
in
which
there
--
there
is
no
standing.
it
was
addressing
just
the
third
prong
of
our
--
of
our
standing
doctrine,
namely
the
prong
that
where
the
court
can
issue
no
relief,
the
remedial
--
the
remedial
prong,
that
one
of
--
one
of
the
elements
of
standing
is
the
court
has
to
be
able
to
provide
relief.
but
there
are
other
elements
to
standing
as
well,
including
whether
there
is
injury
in
fact,
and
whether
the
injury
is
--
you
know,
springs
from
the
action
that
is
challenged.
and
those
--
those
prongs
would
continue
to
exist.
i
didn't
think
knox's
statement
was
meant
to
be
all
inclusive,
that
that's
the
only
--
only
way
in
which
standing
can
be
eliminated.
justice
antonin
scalia
equity
is
wonderful.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'll
bet
you
equity
could
have
considered
the
husband
to
have
been
substituted
automatically
and
could
have
been
considered
the
estate
to
have
been
substituted
automatically.
that
--
that
happens
when
that
particular
element
is
eliminated.
but
there
is
nothing
automatic
about
discovering
some
new
plaintiff
who
is
out
--
we
don't
know
who
is
out
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
undermines
the
collective
aspect
if
she
never
brings
the
suit
in
the
first
place.
i
mean,
i
must
say
i'm
not
terribly
impressed
by
the
fact
that,
you
know,
if
she
drops
out
there
is
--
there
is
no
collective
suit
for
these
other
people.
there
is
also
no
collective
suit
for
these
other
people
if
she
never
appeared
in
the
first
place.
i
don't
know
that
the
law
demands
that
there
be
a
collective
suit.
if
she
doesn't
bring
suit
or
if
she
brings
suit
and
is
given
everything
she
wants,
the
case
is
over
unless
other
people
have
come
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
accept
the
relation-back
doctrine
for
your
purposes
when
--
when
it's
clear
under
the
statute
that
if
parties
come
in
beyond
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
they're
not
in.
their
--
their
entry
is
not
deemed
to
relate
back
to
the
filing
of
the
original
complaint,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
purposes
of
the
statute
of
--
so
you
want
one
relation-back
doctrine
for
the
statute
and
a
different
one
for
what
we're
discussing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
yang,
would
--
would
you
continue
with
what
you
started
speaking
to,
issue
preclusion,
because
i'm
--
i'm
also
--
i
think
it's
questionable
whether
there
would
be
issue
preclusion
on
the
basis
of
a
judgment
issued
with
the
concession
of
the
defendant.
