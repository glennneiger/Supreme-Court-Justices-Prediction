justice
elena
kagan
well,
it
seems
as
though
it's
more
than
housekeeping
issue
that's
involved
here
because
--
i
mean,
i
realize
that
you
have
an
argument
about
what
happens
when
the
plaintiff's
individual
claims
have
been
fully
satisfied,
but
the
plaintiff
continues
to
want
to
represent
other
individuals.
but,
here,
the
plaintiff's
individual
claims
have
not
been
fully
satisfied.
she
walked
away
with
nothing.
she
walked
away
with
no
judgment,
and
she
walked
away
with
no
$7,500.
and
the
question
is:
how
can
it
possibly
be
that
her
individual
claim
was
moot?
justice
elena
kagan
here
is
what
the
court
said
last
in
knox
last
year,
when
it
said:
“
what
makes
a
case
moot
”?
it
says:
"a
case
becomes
moot
when
it's
impossible
for
a
court
to
grant
any
effectual
relief
whatever
to
the
prevailing
party.
"
now,
here
the
judge
says:
okay,
is
this
case
moot?
well,
it's
not
moot
because
i
could
give
--
at
the
very
least,
i
could
give
the
plaintiff
$7500;
but,
i
didn't
give
the
plaintiff
$7500,
so
she
still
has
her
claim
for
at
least
$7500,
regardless
of
the
collective
side
of
this
action.
i
mean,
she
hasn't
been
satisfied.
justice
elena
kagan
this
makes
no
sense
to
me
because
if
the
offer
is
for
judgment,
it
has
to
be
proof
of
validity
and
amount,
because
at
least
you
have
--
you
should
be
able
to
get
a
judgment.
justice
elena
kagan
but
didn't
you
just
tell
me
that
an
offer
results
in
an
admission
of
liability
and
a
judgment
for
a
particular
amount?
justice
elena
kagan
but,
mr.
mann--
justice
elena
kagan
what
do
you
think
the
court
should
do
in
that
circumstance,
where
a
defendant
comes
forward
and
says,
i'm
willing
to
satisfy
the
entire
claim?
what
should
happen?
justice
elena
kagan
is
this
under
rule
68
or
is
this
under
some
inherent
authority?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
katyal,
if
we
do
get
to
the
question
that
mr.
mann
wants
us
to
raise,
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
talking
about
mclaughlin
and
talking
about
gerstein.
those
cases
were
about
prospective
relief.
you're
asking
for
retrospective
relief.
why
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
justice
elena
kagan
so,
mr.
yang,
do
you
think
it
would
be
--
i
--
i
mean,
i
take
the
point
completely
that
judgment
was
rendered
against
the
wrong
party
here.
but
if
the
judgment
had
been
rendered
against
ms.
symczyk
--
for
ms.
symczyk,
but
--
but
the
court
had
done
so
prior
to
looking
at
the
whole
class
question--
justice
elena
kagan
--do
you
think
that
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion?
do
you
think
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
class
question
before
rendering
judgment
for
an
individual
plaintiff?
