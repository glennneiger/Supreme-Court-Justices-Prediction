justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
i
don't
have
good
news
for
them
either.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938,
flsa,
provides
that
an
employee
may
bring
an
action
to
recover
damages
for
specified
violations
on
behalf
of
himself
and
other
similarly
situated
employees.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
who
worked
as
a
nurse
filed
a
suit
against
her
former
employers
alleging
that
they
violated
the
flsa
by
automatically
deducting
30
minutes
per
shift
for
meals
--
for
meal
breaks
even
when
employees
worked
during
those
periods.
respondent
claim
she
was
bringing
suit
for
herself
and
on
behalf
of
all
other
persons
similarly
situated,
but
she
remained
the
only
plaintiff
throughout
the
litigation.
after
respondent
filed
her
suit,
petitioners
offered
her
complete
monitory
relief
on
her
individual
claim
as
well
as
caused
in
attorney's
fees.
respondent
rejected
the
offer.
the
district
court
then
dismissed
the
suit
concluding
that
petitioner's
offer
rendered
the
suit
moot
because
it
would
have
given
the
respondent
everything
she
requested
as
an
individual
plaintiff.
the
third
circuit
reversed.
the
court
concluded
that
even
though
petitioner's
offer
satisfied
respondent's
individual
claim,
the
action
was
not
moot
because
respondent
also
filed
a
complaint
on
behalf
of
similarly
situated
employees.
the
court
believed
that
this
fact
entitled
respondent
to
continue
the
collective
action
suit
in
district
court.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit.
the
constitution
provides
that
federal
courts
only
have
jurisdiction
over
"cases
and
controversies.
this
language
requires
plaintiff
to
show
that
they
had
a
personal
--
plaintiffs
to
show
that
they
have
a
personal
stake
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
at
all
times.
otherwise,
a
suit
becomes
moot
and
must
be
dismissed.
in
this
case,
respondent
did
dispute
--
the
district
court's
didn't
--
did
not
dispute
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
the
petitioner's
offer
fully
satisfied
her
individual
claim.
in
light
of
this
concession,
a
straightforward
application
of
mootness
principles
confirms
that
the
action
was
appropriately
dismissed.
respondent
offers
a
number
of
reasons
why
she
believes
she
still
has
a
personal
stake
in
the
litigation.
we
do
not
find
any
of
them
persuasive.
first,
the
respondent
argues
that
she
has
a
statutory
interest
in
representing
other
employees
under
the
flsa.
however,
nothing
in
the
flsa
gives
a
right
when
the
named
plaintiff
is
the
only
plaintiff
in
the
suit
and
her
individual
claim
is
fully
satisfied.
second,
respondent
relies
on
several
rule
23
class-action
cases
suggesting
that
a
name
plaintiff
may
remain
in
a
suit
even
after
his
claim
is
moot,
if
the
claim
is,
inherently
transitory.
these
cases
are
irrelevant,
however,
because
damages
claims
are
not
inherently
transitory.
damages
claims
remain
viable
until
they
are
settled,
judicially
resolved
or
barred
by
statute
of
limitations.
third,
respondent
argues
that
the
purposes
of
the
flsas
collective
action
provisions
could
be
frustrated
by
strategic
settlement
offers
designed
to
pick
off
named
plaintiffs
before
a
collective
action
can
run
its
course.
but
this
policy
concern
cannot
overcome
the
constitutional
requirement
that
the
named
plaintiff
maintain
a
personal
stake
throughout
the
action.
because
respondent
cannot
show
that
she
maintained
a
personal
stake
in
the
suit
and
once
her
individual
claim
became
moot,
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
was
correct
to
dismiss
the
case
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
kagan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
ginsburg,
breyer,
and
sotomayor
joined.
