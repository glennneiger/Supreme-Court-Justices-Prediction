justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
can
i
ask
this
question?
does
the
district
court
have
the
authority
when
an
offer
of
judgment
is
made
to
hold
a
hearing
as
to
whether
the
offer
of
judgment
actually
gives
the
plaintiff
everything
that
the
plaintiff
could
possibly
get
under
the
complaint?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
where
--
where
does
it
say
that
in
rule
68?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
what
is
it
under?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
if
i
were
to
--
i'm
sorry.
if
i
were
to
think
that
the
individual
plaintiff's
claim
isn't
moot
until
a
judgment
is
entered
into
her
favor,
but
that
--
but
that,
that
issue,
was
not
preserved,
can
you
give
me
an
analog
that
i
should
think
about
with
respect
to
the
second
question?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
should
i
--
yes.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
should
i
assume
that
this
is
the
same
--
the
case
would
then
be
the
same
as
if
a
default
judgment
had
been
entered
in
your
favor
for
that
amount?
