mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
the
question
of
whether
a
withdrawn
rule
68
offer
could
moot
a
case.
it
cannot.
this
court
has
said
that
article
iii's
case
and
controversy
requirement
demands
both
a
plaintiff
with
a
concrete
injury
and
a
matter
where
the
court
is
fully
capable
of
providing
relief.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
did
not
waive
--
we
did
not
waive
the
--
we
did
not
waive
it.
we
do
think
that
the
brief
in
opposition
should
have
pointed
it
out
absolutely.
it
was
a
mistake
on
our
part
not
to
--
not
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
impact
of
an
unaccepted
rule
68
offer.
however,
we
do
think
that
this
court
can
consider
that,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
is
an
answer
to
the
question
presented.
indeed,
it
is
literally
the
question
presented.
here
is
the
question
presented
as
my
friend
mr.
mann
wrote
it:
whether
a
court
--
"whether
a
case
becomes
moot
and
thus
beyond
the
judicial
power
of
article
iii
when
the
lone
plaintiff
receives
an
offer
from
the
defendants
to
satisfy
all
of
the
plaintiff's
claims.
"
and
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
that
the
mere
receipt
of
an
offer
without
more
cannot
possibly
moot
a
case.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
completely
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
guess
i
would
say,
however,
this
court
in
lebron
confronted
a
similar
situation
in
which
the
matter
of
whether
amtrak
was
a
state
actor
was
not
present
in
the
cert
papers;
indeed,
it
had
been
disavowed,
as
justice
scalia's
opinion
for
the
court
said.
nonetheless,
the
court
considered
it
and
got
into
the
merits
of
that
question.
and
we
think
here
actually
it's
an
easier
case
for
the
court
to
get
into
than
lebron.
both--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--it
does
have
the
unaccepted
offer
feature
in
the
question,
and
of
course
this
court's
decision
in
bray
does
say
that
it
is
the
question
presented
as
the
court
--
as
the
court
granted
it,
that
controls.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
exactly
right,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
don't
quite
think
we
conceded
even
that.
that's
a
separate
matter.
that's
about
what
the
terms
of
the
offer
were,
and
our
first
point
to
you
is
to
say
this
offer
wasn't
even
accepted.
mr.
mann
is
waxing
nostalgic
about
an
offer
that
literally
has
not
given
ms.
symczyk
a
dime.
she
is
as
injured
today
as
she
was
the
day
she
filed
her
complaint.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
think
that,
just
like
the
solicitor
general,
we
think
that
in
that
circumstance
it
is
possible
for
the
court
to
enter
a
default
judgment
and
force
relief
upon
the
plaintiff.
and
we
think--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--i
think
it
could
work
either
way
so
long
as
the
forcing
happened
within
the
time
period
of
rule
68.
i
don't
think
the
court
can,
like
lazarus,
raise
this
after
it
has
already
been
withdrawn.
the
text
of
rule
68
says
the
offer
is
now
dead.
if
they
had,
i
imagine,
moved
for
the
court
to
enforce
that
order,
enforce
that
offer
and
enter
a
default
judgment
within
the
14-day
period,
then
i
think
that
would
have
been
something
that
might
have
been
possible
to
do.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
for
two
reasons,
your
honor.
the
first
is,
of
course,
that
is
precisely
what
didn't
happen
here.
ms.
symczyk
has
zero,
not
even
the
$7500.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
i
think
it
goes
back
to
what
then-justice
rehnquist
said
in
roper,
because
what
he
said
is
it's
not
then
just
about
the
individual
plaintiff.
you
can't
force
an
offer
onto
a
plaintiff
that
doesn't
have
all
--
it
doesn't
award
complete
relief,
because
if
you
do
so
it
undermines
the
collective
action
aspect
of
the
claim.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
justice
scalia,
we
think
that
the
congress
has
answered
that
question
at
least
in
216(b)
by
providing
for
both
the
opportunity
to
file
a
complaint
on
her
own
behalf,
as
well
as
for
those
that
are
similarly
situated.
and
so
i
think
that,
as
justice
ginsburg
said
to
my
friend,
if
you
adopt
their
rule,
essentially
you
truncate
that
process
and
eliminate
the
ability
of
people
to
opt
in,
in
any
given
situation,
and
for
that
reason
it's
very
much
--
assuming
that
we
get
to
this
question,
that
it
is
very
much
like
gerstein
or
sosna
or
roper
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
exactly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
precisely
right.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
so
we
think
that
the
corpus
of
cases
that
this
court
has
handled
in
the
class
action
area
such
as
geraghty
and
gerstein
and
the
like,
we
don't
think
that
they
absolutely
control
this
question.
i
don't
want
to
say
that.
but
we
think
that
they
set
up
two
principles
that
help
inform
the
court's
judgment.
the
first
is
that
when
you
have
circumstances
like
this,
in
which
a
claim
has
gone
away
as
moot
because
the
named
representative
of
the
claim
has
gone
away
for
one
reason
or
another,
there
is
play
in
the
joints.
essentially,
you
can
have
a
bridge
plaintiff
who
acts
to
keep
the
case
alive
for
purposes
of
letting
the
class
unfold.
that's
really
what
then
--
justice
rehnquist
was
getting
at
in
his
decision
in
roper,
and
we
think
there
is
a
lot
of
force
to
that
because
otherwise,
as
justice
ginsburg
mentioned,
the
collective
action
mechanism
doesn't
even
get
off
the
ground.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
absolutely
agree
with
that
and
we
think
that's
precisely
the
problem.
and
this
case
illustrates
it,
justice
ginsburg,
because
they
--
we
filed
their
complaint
and
75
days
later
they
filed
their
preemptive
rule
68
offer.
and
now
they
are
coming
before
the
court
and
saying
something
even
more
radical
than
i
think
any
court
has
accepted
to
my
knowledge,
which
is
even
filing
a
class
certification
motion
along
with
the
complaint
wouldn't
be
enough.
that
is
something
that
would
essentially
cut
the
heart
out
of
the
collective
action
mechanism
altogether.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
because
the
text
of
216(b)
provides
for
two
different
processes,
both
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
then
a
subsequent
opt-in
process.
i
suppose
we
could
have
done
that.
that's
what
the
seventh
circuit
has
said
to
do
in
a
case
called
damasco,
but
this
court's
decision
in
hoffman-laroche
says
the
entire
collective
action
mechanism
depends
on
notice
and
discovery
to
find
out
who
those
people
are,
to
find
out
and
make
sure
that
they
are
similarly--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--your
honor,
that
is
what
we
did.
we
asked
the
district
court
right
after
the
rule
68
offer
expired,
within
4
days,
to
say:
please
set
up
a
class
certification
process.
and
that
process
was
then
interrupted
by
their
subsequent
motion
after
the
rule
68
offer
had
expired
to
say:
this
case
is
moot.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
that's
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice,
why
we
think
the
seventh
circuit
rule
doesn't
make
much
sense.
to
come
in
and
to
ask
for
certification
before
you've
conducted
the
discovery
and
gotten
the
names,
we
think
is
really
not
the
right
way
to
go.
rather,
i
think
this
court's
decisions
in
iqbal
and
twombly
suggest
that
you've
got
to
have
some
good-faith
belief
before
you
go
and
file
a
motion
for
class
certification.
and
i'd
be
very
hesitant
for
this
court
to
--
to
recommend
a
rule
to
litigants
that
says
go
and
file
your
motion
for
class
certification
right
away.
this
court,
in
mclaughlin,
i
think,
essentially
said
that
it's
not
about
the
timing
of
when
that
motion
for
certification
unfolds.
at
500
us
68,
the
court
said,
"the
fact
the
class
was
not
certified
until
after
the
named
plaintiffs'
claims
had
become
moot
does
not
deprive
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
"
"we
recognize
in
gerstein
that
some
claims
are
so
transitory
--
inherently
transitory
that
the
trial
court
will
not
even
have
enough
time
to
rule
on
a
motion
for
class
certification.
"
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
right.
i
take
it
this
is
mr.
mann's
point,
that
people
who
aren't
yet
opted
into
a
class
are
not
parties,
and,
therefore,
the
court
can't
properly
consider
them.
and
i
think
that's
the
same
exact
thing
in
the
class
action
context,
is
this
question--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--your
honor,
i
think
nothing
turns
on
their
designation
as
party
status
or
not;
rather,
the
relation-back
doctrine,
to
the
extent
the
court
wants
to
get
into
it
and
deem
this
offer
where
we
got
nothing,
somehow
they
want
to
deem
it
against
us,
but
if
it
does,
and
wants
to
get
into
the
relation-back
doctrine,
i
think
it
would
find
that
it
is
based
on
the
idea
that
the
cases
would
otherwise
go
away,
and
that
you
need
a
bridge
plaintiff.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
and
it's
a
very
important
reason--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--the
reason
for
that
goes
back
to
this
court's
decision
in
flast
--
in
flast,
in
which
it
said
that
in
the
kinds
of
cases
we're
talking
about
here,
it's
not
as
if
we're
risking
a
merits
judgment
in
which
relief
is
going
to
be
imposed
against
one
party
and
possibly
trench
on
the
separation
of
powers.
rather,
the
worst
that
happens
if
you
rule
for
us,
or
if
you
rule
for
the
plaintiffs
in
those
cases,
is
that
the
case
goes
back
down
on
remand
to
find
out
whether
or
not
any
of
those
parties
can
be
identified
and
come
forward.
if
they
do,
then
you
can
reach
the
merits.
but
this
is
a
very
different
separation
of
powers
inquiry
than
the
one
--
in
the
case
in
controversy
inquiry
than
the
one
that
the
court
traditionally
handles.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
it
--
for
purposes
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
exactly.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
absolutely.
and
we
think,
actually--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--and
--
and,
justice
scalia,
we
think
that
that
statute
of
limitations
argument
cuts
the
other
way.
so
the
statute
of
limitations
provision,
which
is
section
255,
says
that,
"in
determining
when
an
act
is
commenced
for
purposes
of
the
statute.
"
and
so
we
don't
think
it
bears
on
the
question
or
not
of
whether
relation
back
applies.
much
to
the
contrary,
the
real
worry
in
the
class
action
context,
and,
indeed,
my
friend's
opening
line
is,
"these
cases
are
going
to
linger
forever,
and
the
defendants
are
going
to
have
no
tool.
"
but
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
context,
actually,
it's
the
very
reverse
because
every
day
counts
against
the
plaintiffs
and
their
counsel.
they
are
incentivized
to
bring
these
cases
quickly
because
the
clock
is
literally
ticking.
and
so
you
don't
have,
i
think,
the
same
worry
that
you
do
in
the
regular
class
action
context
of
one
plaintiff
who
can
essentially
save
the
day
for
all
of
the
different
--
for
all
of
the
different
parties.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
think
that
it
is
a
difference,
but
we
don't
think
it's
enough
to
change
this.
and
it's
for
the
reasons
that
then-justice
rehnquist
said
in
roper.
here
--
here
is
what
he
said.
this
is
at
445
u.s.
341.
"the
distinguishing
feature
here
is
that
the
defendant
has
made
an
unaccepted
offer.
"
"the
action
is
moot
in
the
article
iii
sense
only
if
this
court
adopts
a
rule
an
individual
seeking
to
proceed
as
class
representative
is
required
to
accept
a
tender
of
only
his
individual
claims.
"
"acceptance
need
not
be
mandated
under
our
precedents
since
the
defendant
has
not
been
offered
all
that
has
been
requested
in
the
complaint,
i.e.,
relief
for
the
class,
and
any
other
rule.
"
"would
make
the
questions
unreviewable.
"
and
it's
the
same
point.
he
is
talking
there
about
a
retrospective
action
for
damages.
the
rule
that
we
are
seeking
here
is
no
different
than
what
then-justice
rehnquist
said
in
roper.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
you
should.
and
this
is
in
response
to
what
justice
alito
had
said
in
the
first
part
of
the
argument.
it
is
not
as
if
we
didn't
ask
for
a
hearing.
absolutely,
we
asked
for
a
fairness
hearing
at
joint
appendix
page
110
in
the
district
court,
and
then
again
at
the
third
circuit.
and
what
we
asked
for
specifically
was
review
of
the
contours
of
the
offer.
this
is
at
joint
appendix
page
110.
we
said,
quote
--
excuse
me,
111,
"there
has
been
no
review
and/or
approval
by
this
court
of
defendant's
offer
of
judgment
to
the
plaintiff.
"
and
for
that
reason
we
said,
quote,
"dismissal
is
inappropriate
at
this
early
procedural
juncture.
"
so
this
case
comes
to
the
court
having
asked
that
particular
question
about
the
contours
of
the
offer.
we
think
that
an
offer
that
never
gave
miss
symczyk
anything
is
one
that
didn't
make
her
whole,
and
for
that--
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
--sure.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
think
about
it
is
the
--
the
category
of
cases
from
geraghty,
gerstein
and
swisher
suggest
that
if
the
--
if
you
wanted
to
hold
that
offer
against
us,
that
you
would
then
say,
as
judge
sirica
did,
the
relation-back
doctrine
looks
similar
enough
to
the
216(b)
context
in
this
specific
area.
because,
otherwise,
the
216(b)
collective
actions
won't
work
the
way
congress
intended
them
to
work.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
i
think
--
well,
it's
hard
to
know
how
you'd
hold
that
offer
against
us
in
that
--
and
the
way
in
which
you
did
so,
i
think,
informs
that
second
question.
and
that's
part
of
the
reason
why
we
think
it
is
a
predicate
question.
i
suppose
that
yes,
you
could
say
--
one
path
available
is
to
say
it
is
a
default
judgment
now
that
is
imposed
on
us,
along
the
lines
of
the
second
circuit
decision;
and,
if
so,
then,
as
the
solicitor
general
says
at
pages
15
to
18,
the
then-appropriate
course
would
have
been
for
the
district
court
to
evaluate
whether
other
people
could
opt
into
the
class
using
the
procedures
of
hoffman-laroche.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
oh,
absolutely,
justice
sotomayor.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
we
were
proceeding
on
the
hypothetical.
mr.
neal
kumar
katyal
exactly.
i
was
proceeding
on
the
hypothetical
that
--
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
court
can't
reach
that
question.
and
we
think
lebron
absolutely
permits
this
court
to
do
so,
and
we
think
it's
prudent
for
this
court
to
reach
that
question
first,
because
you
can
side
step
and
avoid
what
is
undoubtedly
a
very
difficult
constitutional
question
about
exceptions
to
article
iii
mootness
and
the
relation-back
doctrine.
