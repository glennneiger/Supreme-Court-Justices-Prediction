justice
ruth
bader

did
that
offer
include
admission
of
liability,
or
was
it
just
that
it
was
going
to
pay
the
amount
of
damages
requested?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
--
if
there
were
judgment
of
liability,
then
that
would
be
preclusive
for
all
other
people
similarly
situated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
--
so
the
next
case
is
another
employee
who
claims
uncompensated
work
time,
and
that's
brought
on
behalf
of
similarly
situated
people.
then
that
next
case,
the
employer
would
be
--
would
be
subject
to
summary
judgment
because
the
liability
has
been
established.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
not
possible
for
anything
to
be
done
about
the
certification
because
you
moved
immediately.
the
complaint
is
filed,
and
then
you
moved
--
then
you
immediately
offered
the
judgment
that
you
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
nothing
in
rule
68
--
you're
basing
the
--
your
position
on
a
rule
that
provides
as
the
only
sanction
if
the
plaintiff
continues
and
gets
less
than
the
offer
of
proof,
then
the
plaintiff
has
to
pay
the
costs.
rule
68
doesn't
say
anything
about
dismissing
suits.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
when
--
when
you
have
a
governing
statute
that
says
that
an
employee
may
bring
suit
for
and
in
behalf
of
himself
and
other
employees
similarly
situated?
can
you
use
a
mere
rule,
rule
68,
to
carve
out
what
the
statute
authors
--
authorizes,
that
is
that
the
employee
can
seek
relief
on
behalf
of
himself
and
others
similarly
situated?
mustn't
you
give
a
chance
for
the
statutory
provision
to
work,
which
you
didn't.
by
filing
immediately,
you
didn't
allow
the
normal
process
of
inviting
opt-ins
to
occur.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
have
to
give
the
plaintiff
an
opportunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
--
suppose
the
plaintiff
had
simultaneously
with
the
filing
of
the
complaint
moved
to
have
it
preliminarily
certified
as
on
behalf
of
other
employees
situated;
so,
instead
of
having
the
complaint,
which
was
labelled
a
collective
complaint,
separate
from
a
motion
for
certification,
they
came
together;
that
the
plaintiff
filed
a
complaint
and
immediately
filed
a
motion
for
certification
and
a
request
to
discover
the
names
of
other
people
similarly
situated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
answer
is
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
there
attorney's
fees
in
that
offer?
i
thought
there
wasn't
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
don't
accept
the
argument
that
i
suggested,
that
is
rule
16
--
216,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
in
saying
that
you
can
commence
a
suit
on
behalf
of
others
similarly
situated,
and
implicit
in
that
is
that
there
be
some
decent
interval
for
you
to
find
similarly-situated
people?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
--
why
didn't
you
file
the
motion
for
certification
along
with
the
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
have
done
that
with
the
complaint
and
i
don't
--
you
say
you
want
to
get
joiners,
so
why
do
you
have
to
wait?
why
wouldn't
you
--
why
wouldn't
the
most
logical
thing
be
to
say,
court,
we
have
labelled
this
a
collective
action
and
now
we
want
to
start
the
ball
rolling
in
getting
certification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
mann,
if
this
is
--
if
what
mr.
yang
just
told
us
is
so,
then
there
would
be
no
issue
preclusion
because
there
has
been
no
adjudication
of
anything.
then
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
falls
into
a
classic
exception
to
mootness,
which
is
defendant's
voluntary
cessation
doesn't
moot
a
controversy;
and,
this
controversy
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evasive
review
because
every
time
--
so
the
plaintiff's
got
this
judgment,
not
preclusive.
the
employer
continues
in
the
old
ways.
the
plaintiff
sues
again.
this
seems
to
me
to
fit
exactly
into
that
category
of
cases.
if
there
is
no
issue
preclusion,
defendant
doesn't
have
to
stop
the
practice,
can
continue
the
practice,
and
then
every
time
there
is
a
suit
say,
okay,
we'll
pay
the
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
nothing
litigated
when
you
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--claim
preclusion,
but
the
claim
is,
for
this
period
of
time
i
wasn't
given
the
compensation.
that's
the
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
there
is
another
period
of
time,
and
there
is
no
issue
preclusion.
