mr.
anthony
a.
yang
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
has
never
been
compensated
for
her
individual
damage
claim,
nor
has
she
received
a
court
judgment
favorably
adjudicating
that
claim.
it
follows
that
her
individual
claim
remains
live,
as
does
this
collective
action.
more
generally,
a
settlement
offer
does
not
moot
a
claim
if
it
is
not
accepted.
individual
freedom
of
contract
is
basic
to
our
legal
system,
and
mutual
assent
is
always
a
necessary
element
for
any
settlement.
rule
68
embodies
those
principles.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
if
you're
--
you're
--
i'm
not
sure
what
the
injury
would
be
in
that
case.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
there's
a
difference--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--this
--
this
i
think
speaks
somewhat
to
justice
scalia's
point
earlier
on,
which
is
there
--
there
are
three
elements
to
article
iii
standing
and
it
also
carries
through
a
bit
to
mootness.
one
is
an
injury
in
fact.
when
we
are
talking
about
retrospective
claims,
there
is
a
past
injury.
if
you
get
a
payment
or
court
redress,
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
injury.
the
injury
continues
to
exist.
redressability--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
--
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
if
there
is
a
breach
of
a
contract,
that
is
an
injury.
and
it
is
a
past--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--if
i
can
just
finish,
i
think
it
is
a
past
injury.
it
is
traceable
to
the
defendant,
and
it
is
redressable
because
the
requested
relief
would
redress
it.
there
may
well
be
a
defense
on
the
merits.
it
may
well
be
that
there
was
payment.
it
could
--
there
could
be
accord
and
satisfaction.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
no.
i
--
i
guess
there
is
a
few
questions.
if
they
--
if
the
defendant
had
played
the
plaintiff,
then
you
would
have
what
is
traditionally
known
as
--
and
it's
accepted
--
you
would
have
accord
and
satisfaction.
it
is
an
affirmative
defense
in
rule
8(c).
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
well,
again,
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
between
injury
and
something
that
redresses
an
injury.
redress
of
an
injury,
like
a
court
redress,
which
is
the
only
question
that's
relevant
in
article
iii,
whether
the
requested
relief
from
the
court
would
redress
the
injury.
now--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--no,
certainly
not.
and
this
is
what
--
what
we
say
is
the
right
approach,
although
it's
not
a
question
of
mootness:
if
an
employer
comes
in
and
throws
up
their
hands
in
court
and
says,
it's
not
worth
it,
i
want
to
forfeit,
i
want
to
just
pay
the
judgment
--
and
--
and
by
the
way,
this
would
not
have
the
issue
preclusive
effect
notwithstanding
my
friend's
statement
earlier.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
the
court
can
simply
enter
judgment.
it
can
simply
enter
judgment
to
--
to
stop
pointless
litigation.
that's
the
normal
course,
is
that
if
there
is
a
past
injury,
it's
redressable,
but
the
defendant
comes
in
and
either
says
accord
and
satisfaction
and
says
that
there
is
no
merits
claim--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--or
i
just
give
up
on
the
merits--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--well,
no.
again,
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
standing
because
there
is
two
issues
going
on.
standing
has
to
exist
at
the
beginning
of
the
suit.
it's
assessed
at
the
date
that
the
complaint
is
filed.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
right.
that's
the
--
the
mootness
inquiry,
then.
it
has
to
continue
to
persist
throughout
the
litigation.
now,
the
fact
that
you
have
had
some
redress
of
some
sort
in
the
form
of
a
private
contract,
that
doesn't
eliminate
the
past
injury,
nor
does
it
mean
that
the
court
could
not,
if
the
court
were
to
give
additional
damages
relief--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--it
doesn't
eliminate
the
injury.
it
might
be
compensation
for
the
injury.
the
injury
would
--
once
a
past
injury
occurs,
it's
there.
it's
unlike
a
prospective
injury,
which
can
be
stopped.
when
you
--
when
you
seek
injunctive
relief,
you
need
have
to
have
an
imminent
on
ongoing
injury.
if
the
defendant
stops,
that
can
eliminate
the
injury
and
then
you
go
into
questions
of
voluntary
cessation.
but
with
respect
to
past
injury,
it's
quite
different.
now,
i
think
the
possibility
of
courts
wasting
their
time
on
this
cases
is
quite
small.
there
is
all
sorts
of
incentives
for
a
plaintiff
not
to
bring
these
suits.
there
is
questions
of
vexatious
litigation.
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act
a
judgment
by
congress
that
employees
are
to
have
a
right
in
the
--
to
--
to
go
forward
in
the
collective
form.
and
as
justice
kennedy's
opinion
for
the
court
in
hoffman-laroche
recognizes,
section
216
imposes
upon
district
courts
a
managerial
responsibility
to
join
plaintiffs
in
an
orderly
way.
and
the
--
the
collective
action
ties
in
with
other
aspects
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
action
is
designed,
as
hoffman-laroche
says,
to
serve
the
important
function
of
preventing
violations.
it
also
says
that
the
--
the
collective
action
is
to
be
enforced
to
the
full
extent
of
its
terms.
these
are
judgments
that
congress
made
because
they
were
trying
to
protect
particularly
vulnerable
employees
in
our
society.
these
are
nonunionized
generally,
low-wage
employees
without
bargaining
power.
congress
created
liquidated
damages
in
order
to
provide
a
strong
deterrent
for
employers
to
comply
with
the
law.
and
also--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--yeah.
this
--
this
is
page
14,
footnote
2
of
our
brief.
issue
--
there
might
be
claim
preclusion
in
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
able
to
bring
other
claims
associated,
res
--
traditional
res
judicata.
but
for
a
judgment
entered
by
a
concession,
the
actual
issue
is
not
litigated
and
necessary
to
the
judgment.
and
so
it's
well
established
that
that
would
not
serve
any
issue
preclusive
effect,
and
in
fact
i
think
if
it
did
it
would
put
a
chill
on
the
ability
of
people
to
settle
their
disputes
through
offers
of
judgment.
so
our
solution
that
we
provide
the
court,
we
think,
is
the
only
solution
that
provides
a
practical
way
to
accommodate
the
very
important
interests
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
one,
it
recognizes
the
district
court's
discretion
to
resolve
the
case
in
a
sensible
way
in
order
to--
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
--right.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
in
the
context
of
a
collective
action,
yes,
because
of
the
congressional
policy
that
gives
plaintiffs
a
right
to
proceed
collectively.
that
said,
the
collective
process
does
not
have
to
be
a
burdensome
one.
there
are
certain
small
claim,
idiosyncratic
claims
that
a
court
can
simply
look
at
the
--
the
allegations
and
say,
there
are
not
going
to
be
similarly
situated
people
here.
but
when
we
have
an
allegation
like
we
have
here,
which
there
is
a
widespread
policy
of
deducting
30
minutes
a
day,
notwithstanding
the
employer's
knowledge
that
the
employers
--
employees
are
working
through
that
lunch
break,
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
--
of
employees
similarly
situated,
and
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
court
not
to
proceed
at
least
down
that
road,
provide
some
discovery,
facilitate
class
notice
--
as
the
court
in
hoffman-laroche
recognizes
is
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
under
section
216
--
and
at
the
end
of
that
process,
which
could
be
short
for
some
cases,
a
little
longer
for
some,
should
be,
of
course,
always
exercised
in
the
court's
sound
discretion.
at
the
end
of
the
case,
if
there
are
more
plaintiffs
who
opt
in,
then
it
proceeds
as
a
collective
action.
if
it
remains
the
single
plaintiff,
the
court
might
decide
to
enter
judgment.
now,
we
don't
think
that
follows,
justice
sotomayor,
from
rule
68.
it
simply
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
willing
to
just
to
pay,
to
give
up.
it
won't
have
issue-preclusive
effect;
it
resolves
the
dispute:
judgment
in
the
amount
of
$7,500,
attorneys'
fees,
costs.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
i
don't
think
it's
a
fairness
hearing.
i
think
what
it
does
is
--
it
--
it's
a
question
about
whether
there
are
people
similarly
situated,
and
if
there
are
plaintiffs
similarly
situated,
the
case
should
proceed.
if,
at
that
point,
the
defendant
wants
to
pay
everyone,
it
certainly
could
do
so.
but
my
guess
is
usually
the
--
the
claims
would
be
litigated
on
the
merits
of
that.
mr.
anthony
a.
yang
thank
you.
