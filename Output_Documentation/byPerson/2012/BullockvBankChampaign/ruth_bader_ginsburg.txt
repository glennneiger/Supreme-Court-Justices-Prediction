justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
we
have
here
is,
i
think
everybody
agrees,
that
these
transactions
were
not
authorized
and
they
were
self-dealing
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
benefit
to
mr.
bullock
from
the
investments
that
were
made.
so
what,
in
addition
to
being
unauthorized
and
self-dealing,
which
the
government
tells
us
should
be
enough
to
make
defalcation,
what
else
other
than
that
it
was
not
authorized
and
it
was
self-dealing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
is
a
trustee
who
is
taking
--
borrowing
against
the
cash
value
of
the
life
insurance
making
an
investment
for
the
benefit
of
himself
and
his
mother
getting
profit
from
that
investment
and
not
sharing
it
with
the
other
siblings
who
are
also.
so
what
more
than
--
i
mean,
he
did
that
all
advertently.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
two
other
transactions
which
were
not
done
at
the
bidding
of
the
father?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
--
what
about
the
profit
from
the
transactions,
the
profit
that
he
made?
yes,
he
paid
back
everything
with
interest,
but
in
addition
to
that,
according
to
the
illinois
court
judgment,
there
was
a
profit
that
he
made
that
he
didn't
put
back
in
the
trust,
he
didn't
put
in
the
trust.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
question
that
is
not
a
technical
bankruptcy
question,
but
he
--
the
objective
of
filing
for
bankruptcy
was
to
get
rid
of
this
judgment
debt,
this
illinois
judgment
debt,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
eleventh
circuit
said,
you
know,
we're
really
sympathetic
to
that,
but
the
problem
is
that
the
bank
would
not
let
you
sell
the
collateral.
if
you
could
sell
the
collateral,
then
you
could
pay
off
the
loan
and
you
wouldn't
need
to
declare
bankruptcy.
did
you
bring
such
a
suit,
the
suit
that
suggests
that
the
bank
was
the
culpable
party
here
by
not
letting
you
sell
the
property
which
would
have
enabled
you
to
pay
the
debt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
byrne,
i
--
i
wasn't
finished
asking
you
about
the
background
of
this.
it
--
it
seems
the
simplest
thing,
if
the
bank
is
the
culprit,
then
why
not
go
after
the
bank
and
then
get
the
money
which
would
make
the
chapter
7
unnecessary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
what
the
eleventh
circuit
thought
was
a
solution
to
this
problem.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
were
they
wrong
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
shows
why
the
bank
refused
to
release
any
of
the
collateral.
