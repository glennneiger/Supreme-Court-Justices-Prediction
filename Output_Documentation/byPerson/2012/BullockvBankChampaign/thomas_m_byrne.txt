mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
one
of
the
most
confounding
questions
of
bankruptcy
law,
and
that
is
the
meaning
of
defalcation
which
is
found
currently
in
section
523(a)(4)
of
the
code.
it
is
an
undefined
term
in
a
bankruptcy
code
with
more
than
100
defined
terms
and
it
has
been
in
the
bankruptcy
code
or
bankruptcy
act,
excuse
me,
since
1841
and
in
every
version
of
it
since
then.
there
is
no
plain
contemporary,
ordinary
meaning
that
we
can
resort
to
with
respect
to
interpretation
of
the
word
because
it
is
not
in
common
use.
this
case
presents
both
the
question
of
the
action
required
to
establish
defalcation
and
the
mental
state
that
most
--
that
must
accompany
it.
and
on
the
mental
state
issue,
the
circuits
have
split
in
probably
three
ways
at
least.
the
eleventh
circuit
here
held
that
petitioner
committed
defalcation
by
acting
recklessly
and
affirmed
on
summary
judgment,
a
summary
judgment
order
that
was
granted
for
the
petitioning
creditor.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
your
honor,
it
should
apply
to
both,
but
it
applies
--
the
act
must
be
accompanied
by
a
culpable
mental
state.
we
will
argue
that
--
and
have
argued
that
mistake
of
law
can
be
relevant
to
the
knowledge
that
the
actor
has
when
he
commits
the
act,
and
we
have
argued
that
in
this
particular
circumstance
particularly
involving
dischargeability,
that
a
mistake
of
law
ought
to
be
permissible
in
responding
to
the
claim
of
defalcation.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
your
honor,
we
believe
that
a
showing
of
extreme
recklessness
at
least
is
required
as
to
the
self-dealing,
and
so
we
have
advocated
for
the
first
and
second
circuit
standard,
which
requires
either
extreme
recklessness
or
conscious
misbehavior
by
the
actor.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
your
honor,
let
me
go
back
to
the
question,
first
were
--
were
the
loans
authorized.
now,
this
case
--
the
finding
of
defalcation
here
is
based
entirely
on
the
two
illinois
court
orders
in
collateral
estoppel.
and
the
illinois
courts
specifically
reserved
the
question
of
whether
the
loans
were
authorized.
but
let
me
put
that
aside,
please,
and
answer
your
second
question.
and
what
--
what
sets
this
case
apart
and
what
--
what
at
least
creates
a
factual
question
on
whether
mr.
bullock
committed
defalcation
was
what
was
his
--
was
the
overall
transaction.
this
is
a
family
trust,
it
was
created
by
his
father,
involving
his
father's
life
insurance
policy.
there
is
uncontradicted
evidence
that
he
did
not
know
that
making
a
loan
to
his
mother
at
his
father's
request
would
somehow
run
afoul
of
the
law
more
than
a
decade
later
when
this
all
came
--
when
this
all
came
to
court.
so
we
say,
your
honor,
that
there
is
at
least
a
factual
question
that
would
have
entitled
him,
should
have
entitled
him
to
a
trial
on
the
question
of
the
mental
state
that
accompanied
his
actions.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
your
honor,
they
were
done
at
the
bidding
of
the
mother
and
also
they
were
--
they
went
into
the
family
business.
these
are
two
loans
that
went
into
the
business
created
by
the
father
and
the
mother,
the
garage
building
business.
that's
where
the
proceeds
went.
and
so
it
would
have
been
a
surprise,
we
say,
to
the
average
person
to
learn
that
there
was
a
legal
problem
with
those
loans.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
it's
not
unusual
to
have
some
sort
of
conflict
about
that,
your
honor.
but
the
record
is
very
limited
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
preferences
of
the
others
were.
it
is
--
it
seems
clear
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--that
--
that
position
seems
clear
now,
your
honor,
that
--
that
background,
these
loans
were
made,
please,
recall,
in
the
'80s.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
that
is
not
clear
from
the
record,
your
honor.
i
think
i
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
it
is
not
in
the
record
in
the
case,
so--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--your
honor,
let
me
--
let
me
try.
let
me
try
to
give
such
an
answer.
the
first,
with
respect
to
larceny,
embezzlement
and
fraud,
a
mistake
of
law
is
admissible
where
it
negates
the
scienter
or
the
mental
state.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
your
honor,
the
knowledge
of
the
law,
knowledge
of
wrongdoing
i
think
is
what
--
what
you're
asking,
where
does
that
come
into
this?
and
it
comes
into
the
question
a,
if
you
didn't
have
it;
and
b,
the
question
becomes
was
it
extremely
reckless
under
the
scienter
standard
that
the
first
and
second
circuits
--
the
first
and
second
circuits
follow--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--well,
your
honor,
but
he
did
it
without
knowing
that
they--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--well,
your
honor,
in
many
instances
--
not
many
--
but
in
some
instances,
the
court
has
held
that
not
knowing
that
a
practice
is
unlawful
is
a
defense
to
a
charge
of
the
crime.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
your
honor,
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
on
the
mental
state
--
and
then
i'll
get
to
the
actus
reus
element
of
this
quickly
--
but
as
to
the
mental
state,
if
the
mental
state
is
not
culpable
then
it
seems
entirely
inconsistent--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--well,
your
honor,
of
course,
it
does
not
save
you
from
liability.
our
issue
here
is
dischargeability,
which
is
a--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--well,
your
honor,
because
for
dischargeability
purposes,
because
of
gleason
v.
thaw,
and
the
rule
that
--
that
bankruptcy
discharge
exceptions
are
confined
to
those
plainly
expressed
doubts,
are
resolved
in
favor
of
the
debtor.
and
if
you
look
at
the
other
requirements
for
exceptions
to
discharge
in
section
523(a)
you
see
a
high
level
of
culpable
conduct.
for
example,
in
geiger,
the
court
held
that
reckless
torts
do
not
amount--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--well,
your
honor,
you're
alluding
to
cheek
v.
united
states
and
rasco
v.
united
states,
cases
in
which
ignorance
of
the
law
as
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
was
found
to
be
a
defense
in
those
cases.
and
what
you
had
in
those
cases
was
a
complex
legal
regime.
you
had
the
tax
laws
and
then
you
had
the
--
anti-structuring
statute.
and
here,
we
say
that
trust
law
in
and
of
itself
is
a
complex
enough
legal
regime
that
a
mistake
of
law
at
least
ought
to
be
admissible,
not
for
liability
but
for
establishing
bankruptcy--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
that
defalcation
requires
a
shortage
in
accounts
at
the
end
of
the
day.
and
so
there
must
be
--
in
the
trust,
there
must
be
some
res
missing
when
the
trustee
is
called
to
account.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
your
honor,
the
deletion
of
the
word
“
misappropriation
”
in
1978
from
the
bankruptcy
code
by
congress
suggests
that
misappropriations
that
--
that
are
on
an
interim
basis
that
cause
--
that
do
not
cause
a
loss
to
the
trust
and
are
--
are
never
accounted
for
is
not
the
kind
of
action
or
act
that
should
result
in
an
exception
to
discharge.
but
if
you
look
with
respect
to
defalcation
at
the
definitions
at
the
time,
the
definitions
that
were
available
in
1841
as
i
believe
justice
breyer
has
done,
the
--
the
definitions
you
get
are,
for
example,
in
webster's
1828
dictionary,
the
act
of
cutting
off
or
deducting
a
part.
and
the
origin
of
the
defalcation
exception,
and
i
believe
the
amici
for
respondent
are
correct
in
this
respect,
was
the
swartwout
scandal
in
1838,
when
one
samuel
swartwout,
who
was
the
--
in
charge
of
collections
for
the
new
york
customs
house,
which
was
a
substantial
part
of
the
federal
budget
at
that
time,
was
found
after
he
departed
the
country
to
have
$1.2
million
missing
from
his
accounts.
and
that
was
referred
to
as
a
defalcation
at
the
time
and
it's
quite
reasonable
to
assume
that's
how
it
ended
up
in
the
statute.
so
the
loss
of
res
there
for
loss
of
funds
to
which
the
--
the
fiduciary
is
responsible
for
collecting
at
the
time
of
--
that
--
that
he
turns
over
his
office,
because
this
really
originated
with
public
officials,
is
the
relevant
time.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
correct,
justice
kagan.
but
here,
there
was
never
any
money
taken
from
the
trust
that
didn't
wind
up
with
the
trust
at
the
end
of
the
day.
the
evidence
is
that
the
net
policy
value
on
the
day
mr.
bullock
unwittingly
became
a
trustee
in
1978
was
the
same
as
when
he,
at
the
end
of
his
tenure--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--he
was
--
he
was
charged
with
having
profited
with
respect
to
one
or
more
of
the
loans,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
it
did
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
he
--
he
does
for
liability
purposes,
of
course,
justice
scalia.
but
here
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
bankruptcy
defalcation.
and
that's
a
question
of
federal
law.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
that
--
that
action
has
not
been
brought,
your
honor.
and
in
that
action,
let's
say
it
were
brought
today,
it
could
do
nothing
to
relieve
petitioner
of
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit
and
the
lower
courts
here
that
he
has
a
debt
that
is
--
a
substantial
debt
that
is
excepted
from
discharge.
he
could
continue
litigating
perhaps
if
he
has
the
resources
in
--
in
illinois
for
many
more
years
perhaps,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--your
honor--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--your
honor,
the
--
the
loss
to
the
trust
should
be
measured
by
the
economic
loss
to
the
trust
between
points
a
and
point
b.
and
--
and
it's
--
it's
as
simple
as
that,
and
of
course
here
there
wasn't
loss
to
the
trust.
as
you
point
out,
it's
an
unusual
situation
perhaps,
but
of
course
life
insurance
trusts
and
other
kinds
of
trusts
that
present
this
situation
are--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--the
profit
to
the
trustee
would
not
come
into
play.
it
could
come
into
play
for
fraud.
it
could
come
into
play
for
embezzlement.
it
could
come
into
play
if
the
mental
state
that
we
argue
for
is
--
is
otherwise
met.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
for
the
--
for
that
worst
case,
your
honor,
there
is
embezzlement
in
the
statute.
so
if
a
--
if
someone
comes
into
possession
of
property
and
misuses
it
and
does
so
with
fraudulent
intent,
it
sounds
like
here,
then
there
is
a
--
then
embezzlement
can
be
established
under
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
your
honor,
there
is
a
good
bit
not
in
the
record
on
that,
and
i
presume
you
want
me
to
stick
to
the
record
in
responding
and
there
is
no
real
explanation
for
that.
there
is
in
the
record
a
consistent
track
of
petitioner
trying
to
get
the
bank
to
sell
the
collateral
in
order
to
pay
the
debt
off
over
time
and
with
an
urgency
to
it
because
the
collateral
was
deteriorating
in
value.
but
beyond
that,
there's
not
anything
else
in
the
record
about
the
practicality
or
availability
of
the
remedies
in
the
illinois
court.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
yes,
and
also
as
a
legal
matter,
because
the
illinois
courts
cannot
set
aside
the
order
here
excepting
the
debt
from
discharge.
the
only
--
the
only
agenda
potentially
left
for
petitioner
would
be
litigation
in
the
--
in
the
illinois
courts
against
the
trustee
to
create
some
sort
of
a
judgment
that
might
be
used
in
some
way
to
ameliorate
the
effect
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
judgment,
but
he
still
has
--
basically,
he's
been
consigned
to
permanent
insolvency
the
way
that
this
judgment
now
sits.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
--
that
that's
the
way
that
this
particular
version
of
the
bankruptcy
act
is
set
up.
in
the
past
however,
in
neal
v.
clark,
in
an
important
decision
by
this
court
in
1878,
the
court
held
that
fraud
should
be
construed
to
require
fraud
with
moral
turpitude
because
of
the
presence
of
embezzlement
in
the
18--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--thank
you,
your
honor.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
assuming
he
knew,
your
honor,
he
could
--
his
position
is
and
it
was
--
it
was
true
his
position
in
the
state
court
was
that
he
could
have
invested
it,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--as
a
trustee
for
the
trust.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
well,
your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
of
course,
the
illinois
court
never
decided
whether
he
was
right
about
whether
he
could
actually
invest
the
money
other
than
as
--
as
specified.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
if
you
assume
he
could
have--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
--
the
trust
instrument,
i
think
you'll
see
does
not
expressly
authorize
him
to
do
that.
he's
making
--
he
was
making
an
argument--
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
--if
the
argument
is
or
if
the
trust
provided
that
he
could
invest
in
other
things
and
it
made
him
prudent
investments,
then
there
could
be
a
loss
to
the
trust.
then
his
mental
state
would
--
would
be
poor.
mr.
thomas
m.
byrne
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
to
respond
to
a
few
things
said
by
respondent
and
by
the
solicitor,
the
petitioner
actually
did
put
into
the
record
when
he
opposed
summary
judgment
pro
se
in
the
bankruptcy
court
all
of
his
evidence
about
what
he
--
what
should
have
been
done
with
the
money
that
was
in
the
constructive
trust,
what
should
have
been
done
with
the
property
that
was
in
the
constructive
trust
during
that
period.
he
put
that
in
--
in
evidence,
it's
in
the
record
and
his
repeated
pleas
that
the
assets
be
sold
to
pay
the
judgment
are
reflected
by
that.
the
respondent
relied
entirely
on
the
two
illinois
court
orders
and
put
in
no
evidence
other
than
the
original
pleadings,
if
they
are
evidence,
in
the
--
in
the
illinois
case.
so
there
is
that
question
about
the
record,
and
petitioner
did
track
what
--
what
his
efforts
were
to
try
to
persuade
the
trustee
to
consent
to
the
sale
of
the
property.
and
it's
interesting,
the
constructive
trust,
of
course,
was
imposed
on
the
properties
that
were
acquired
with
loans
two
and
three.
so
if
there
are
any
profit
from
the
loans,
they
would
have
been
caught
in
those
properties.
and
eventually,
of
course,
they
were
not
sold.
but
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
loss
here,
a
trial
would
be
needed.
and
that's
really
why
we
were
hoping
the
court
will
give
us
--
give
mr.
bullock
a
day
in
court
here
to
establish
under
the
proper
legal
standard
what
any
loss
really
was,
if
there
was
one.
and
it
was
said
earlier
that
a
conflict
of
interest
itself
is
a
defalcation,
but
not
if
there's
no
loss.
that's
just
--
that's
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
other
exceptions
to
discharge
in
the
code.
mr.
gannon
read
the
--
noted
that
the
dictionary
definitions
evolved
over
time,
but
the
1856
definition
of
defalcation
from
bouvier's
law
dictionary
that's
quoted
in
the
government's
brief
actually
still
reflects
the
--
the
idea
that
--
or
the
definition
that
defalcation
is
the
act
of
a
defaulter.
and
a
defaulter
is
defined
as,
"one
who
fails
in
making
his
accounts
correct.
"
so
by
1856,
years
after
the
first
enactment
of
defalcation,
that
was
still
the
definition
that
was
prevailing
in
the
day,
at
least
according
to
that
dictionary,
and
according
to
the
others
that
--
that
we
cite
earlier.
petitioner
here
made
a
mistake
in
judgment.
there
was
never
any
finding
of
dishonesty
on
his
part.
there
was
never
any
finding
that
he
acted
with
a
malicious
intent.
in
fact,
there
was
a
finding
that
he
acted
with
no
apparent
malicious
intent
in
the
illinois
courts.
this
question
is
one
of
dischargeability,
and
his
debt
is
really
what
bankruptcy
is
for.
it's
for
a
fresh
start
for
an
honest,
but
unfortunate
debtor.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
remarks.
