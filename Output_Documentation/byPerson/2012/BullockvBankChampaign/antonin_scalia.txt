justice

scalia
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
in
loans.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
did
not
go
back
into
the
trust.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
it
should.
doesn't
the
trustee
have
to
disgorge
whatever
he
makes
by
improper
use
of
the
trust
funds?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
where
does
this
reckless
act
come
from?
where
do
you
get
reckless
act
out
of
either
fraud
or
defalcation?
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
so.
where
did
they
get
it
from?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
--
why
are
you
giving
away
that
it's
not
in
the
traditional
sense?
i
think
it's
a
loss
in
the
traditional
sense.
the
trust
was
entitled
to
whatever
profit
was
made
from
the
use
of
its
funds,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
made
a
quarter
million
dollars
that
should
have
belonged
to
the
trust.
it's
not
enough
to
say,
well,
you
know,
i'll
pay
you
2
percent
interest
or
whatever
the
going
rate
of
interest
was.
he
made
$250,000
which
should
have
been
given
to
the
trust.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
consistent
with
the
original
meaning
of
defalcation
to
which
you
were
appealing.
it's
pretty
clear
to
me
that
the
original
meaning
of
--
is
a
cutting
off,
a
failure
to
turn
over
money
that
was
due.
so
you
--
are
you
appealing
the
original
meaning
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
defalcation
just
means
breach
of
trust.
that's
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what
made
it
a
defalcation,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
then
you
say
there
has
to
be
a
cutting
off.
there
has
to
be
a
loss,
for
defalcation.
not
just
for
--
for
a
debt,
but
also
for
the
defalcation.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
are
you
fighting
that?
you're
going
to
have
to
prove
the
loss
anyway.
you
say
there
is
a
loss.
justice
antonin
scalia
“
malversation
”.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
not?
i
mean,
it's
a
--
it's
a
violation
of
the
trustee's
responsibility
when
he
makes
a
negligent
investment
of
the
funds,
right?
and
so
he
doesn't
turn
over
as
much
money
as
should
be
turned
over.
it's
a
defalcation.
