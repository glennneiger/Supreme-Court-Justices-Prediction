but
i
guess
the
question
is
how
do
you
measure
this
loss?
i
mean,
if
you
take
money
away
and
then
you
give
it
back,
or
even
if
you
give
it
back
with
2
percent
interest
or
something,
i
mean,
maybe
if
that
money
had
remained
in
the
trust
--
and
i
realize
that
this
is
a
strange
trust,
but
--
but
we
have
to
think
about
other
kinds
of
trusts
--
if
that
money
had
remained
in
the
trust,
there
would
have
been
a
profit
to
be
made
from
that
money.
and,
you
know,
it's
not
--
if
you
say,
well,
i
gave
it
back,
well,
yes,
but
if
you
had
just
left
it
there,
you
would
have
had
that
money
plus
all
the
money
that
that
money
earned.
justice

mr.
bensinger,
if
i
heard
you
correctly,
you
said
that
the
definition
was
a
monetary
deficiency
arising
from
a
breach
of
trust.
is
that
--
does
that
mean
that
you're
conceding
that
there
has
to
be
a
loss
of
monetary
deficiency?
justice
elena
kagan
whether
there
was
or
was
not
in
this
case,
but
you're
conceding
that
there
has
to
be
a
monetary
deficiency
according
to
the
traditional
definitions.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
monetary
deficiency,
again,
isn't
that
a
loss?
but
i
thought
that
your
position
was
that
there
didn't
need
to
be
a
loss.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
certainly
true--
justice
elena
kagan
--in
an
ordinary
trust,
but
isn't
there
a
real
question
as
to
this
trust,
because
if
this
trust
would
--
the
trustee
shouldn't
have
been
investing
this
in
the
first
place.
all
that
this
trust
was
going
to
get
was
the
principal
plus
a
fixed
income.
