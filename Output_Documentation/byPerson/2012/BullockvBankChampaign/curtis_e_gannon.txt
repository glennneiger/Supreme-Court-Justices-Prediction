mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
no
particular
mens
rea
is
inherent
in
the
term
“
defalcation
”
or
the
structure
of
section
523(a)(4).
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
each
of
those
terms
does
have
some
mens
rea
associated
with
it.
it
is
not,
however,
the
willfulness
requirement
that
my
friend
was
invoking
on
the
other
side.
there
is
no
obligation
under
any
of
those
that
there
be
an
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty.
there
are
specific
intents
to
defraud,
but
i
think
we
know
that
this
can't
be
--
it
can't
have
that
mens
rea
because
that
would
make
it
superfluous.
that's
what
judge
hand
said
in
the
herbst
decision,
and
that's
what
even
the
second
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
recognized
here,
that
they
could
not
adopt
the
same
mens
rea
that
belongs
with
the
other
terms
here
and
i--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--pardon?
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
that
would
probably
be
embezzlement
and
it
would
be
superfluous
in
that
sense.
i
think
that
the
dictionary
definitions,
if
you
look
at
the
dictionary
definitions
of
defalcation
that
we
quote
on
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief,
both
the
english
dictionary
definitions
and
the
legal
dictionary
definitions,
they
basically--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--pardon?
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
we
did
quote
the
samuel
johnson
dictionary
and
the
webster's
1828
dictionary
that
have
that
meaning.
if
you
look
at
the
oxford
english
dictionary
definition,
that
was
an
obsolete
meaning.
and
i
think
that
it's
quite
clear
that
the
meaning
that
congress
was
invoking
here
is
what
is
dealt
with
under
heading
five
in
the
oxford
english
dictionary.
and
my
friend
quoted
it
earlier:
there
is
either
a
monetary
deficiency
through
a
breach
of
trust
by
one
who
has
the
management
or
charge
of
funds--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
there
are
two
questions
there
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
illustrative
quotations
that
the
oed
uses
for
that
very
definition
doesn't
actually
refer
to
a
monetary
deficiency,
and
neither
do
most
of
the
other
dictionary
definitions.
so
i
do
think
that
there's
probably
an
open
question
about
what
the
purest
meaning
of
the
term
defalcation,
whether
it
requires
a
loss.
here,
we
do
think
that
there
is
a
loss.
there
is
a
loss
in
a
very
real
and
traditional
sense.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
that
because
the
petitioner
took,
engaged
in
self-dealing
and
made
a
profit
with
that,
with
the
money
that
he
had
taken
out
of
the
trust
corpus
and
refused
to
return
those
profits
to
the
trust,
that
is
a
loss
to
the
trust,
just
as
it
would
be
had
he
taken
the
money
and
invested
it
in
some
great
investment
scheme
and
--
or
he
decided
to
bet
it
at
the
track--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--and
he
decided--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
way
this
trust
operates.
it's
not
consistent
with
petitioner's
own
arguments.
petitioner's
argument
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
the
argument
that
he
says
is
the
reason
why
there
is
no
determination
about
whether
this
was
an
authorized
use
of
the
money
under
the
trust
instrument
is
that
--
that
he
was
allowed
to
invest
the
assets
of
the
trust.
and
so
the
way
the
courts
--
and
the
parties
have
offered
to
lodge
the
trust
instrument
with
the
court.
as
i
understand
it
it's
not
otherwise
in
the
record.
but
the
point
here
is
that
he
did--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
last
part
i
said,
that
the
parties
have
offered
to
lodge
the
trust
instrument
with
the
court,
but
my
understanding
is
that
it's
not
in
the
record.
but
i
don't
think
anybody
has
taken
the
position
that
the
only
thing
that
could
ever
be
in
the
trust
was
the
life
insurance
policy
plus
6
percent.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
i
believe
that
that
is
not
the
case
and
that
is
not
even
consistent
with
petitioner's
own
position
in
the
state
court,
where
he
said
he
was
taking
this
money
and
investing
it
in
some
alternative
thing
because
he
thought
that
would
be
safer
than
leaving
the
money
with
the
life
insurance
company.
and
i
think
if
i
can
go
back
to
explaining
why
i
think
that
this
is
a
loss
and
so
i
think
that
this
trust
is
not
as
unusual
or
unique
as
you
think
it
is,
in
part
because
we
don't
have
the
language
of
it
in
front
of
us.
but
secondly,
i
was
trying
to
say
that
had
he
taken
this
money
for
an
authorized
purpose
or
not
and
decided
he
was
going
to
go
invest
it,
he
had
some
boffo
scheme,
he
had
some
friend
who
had
a
great
stock
tip,
or
he
had
a
tip
at
the
races
and
he
was
going
to
go
down
to
the
track
and
bet
this
money,
he
made
1,000
percent,
and
he
decided,
well,
you
know
what,
had
i
not
taken
the
money
out
of
the
trust
all
i
would
have
to
do
is
return,
all
i
have
to
do
is
make
it
whole
in
the
sense
of
having
the
6
percent
that
it
otherwise
would
have
had,
that
everybody
would
understand,
that's
a
breach
of
his
duty
of
loyalty.
that's
a
defalcation.
it
is
an
injury
to
the
trust.
it
is
a
loss
in
every
relevant
sense.
and
in
addition
here,
the
$35,000
that
the
state
court
awarded
for
attorney's
fees
and
costs
is
also
another
concrete
loss
to
the
estate.
and
this
court's
decision
in
cohen
v.
de
la
cruz,
which
was
about
nondischargeability
of
a
fraud
judgment,
of
a
debt
for
fraud,
said
that
that
debt
for
fraud
included
all
of
the
legal
liability
associated
with
the
underlying
fraud--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--it's
not
that
there
--
it's
not
the
opportunity
loss.
it's
not
the
fact
that
the
trust
wasn't
already
earning
the
interest
in
the
--
vis
--
vis
the
insurance
company
as
it
otherwise
would.
petitioner's
position
is
if
he
already
gave
back
the
money
that
it
would
have
earned
in
interest
vis
--
vis
the
insurance
company,
my
position,
the
government's
position,
is
that
the
loss
here
is
that
he
failed
to
disgorge
the
profits
that
he
made
by
self-dealing
in
the
assets
of
the
trust
corpus.
that
is
a--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--the
other
argument--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--my
response
to
that
is
that
the
neal
v.
clark
decision
that's
being
discussed
here
is
--
and
we
discuss
this
in
our
brief
--
is
distinguishable
in
part
because
its
current
descendent
is
not
this
provision.
it
is
not
this
reference
to
fraud.
it
is
the
exception
from
discharge
in
paragraph
(a)(2)(a).
and
what
makes
this
different
is
that
this
is
fraud
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
which
was
not
true
in
the
context
of
neal
v.
clark,
and
that's
something
that
the
court
said
at
the
time,
that
because
it
did
not
actually
have
the
limitations
of
the
fiduciary
context,
they
needed
to
infer
some
type
of
limitation.
they
inferred
it,
the
court
inferred
it,
from
embezzlement.
and
so,
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
the
way
congress
has
dealt
with
that
is
that
it
has
put
actual
fraud
in
(a)(2)(a),
and
here
it
has
grouped
fraud
with
defalcation
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
and
therefore
it
includes
the
type
of
limitation
that
the
court
was
trying
to
impose
in
neal
v.
clark.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
inherent
mens
rea
in
defalcation
and--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
i
think
when
it
gets
further
away
from
the
heartland
definition
of
defalcation,
which
does
--
which,
as
was
discussed
in
this
court's
1844
decision
in
chapman
and
in
the
1841
bankruptcy
law,
the
defalcation
was
equated
with
self-dealing
in
trust
assets.
and
so
we
think
that's
the
heart
of
defalcation.
as
you
move
away
from
that
particular
type
of
fiduciary
breach,
and
if
you
move
away
from
there
it
may
become
more
relevant
whether
there
is--
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
--well,
to
be
fair,
the
dictionary
definitions
are
broad
enough
to
include
other
types
of
fiduciary
breaches,
but
it's
not
clear
that
that
means
that
defalcation
needs
to
be
doing
all
the
work
here
of
potentially
putting
limits
on
the
scope
of
the
exception.
and
so
if
you
look
at
the
ninth
circuit,
for
instance,
the
way
it
has
handled
this
is
it
has
recognized,
as
we
do,
that
defalcation
can
be
innocent
and
--
but
it
has,
it
has
concluded
that
the
essence
of
defalcation
is
the
failure
to
account
for
or
to
produce
funds,
and
therefore
it
wouldn't
be
something
that
would
just
be
garden
variety
mismanagement
of
the
assets.
mr.
curtis
e.
gannon
well,
we
certainly
do
think
that
that
may
well
be
the
ultimate
answer.
we
think
that
would
be
further
away
from
the
core
of
defalcation,
but
it's
not
this
case,
so
we
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm.
