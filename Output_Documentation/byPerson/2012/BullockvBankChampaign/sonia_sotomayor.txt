justice

their
preference
is
that
they
wanted
a
piece
of
the
action.
they
still
do.
they
want
the
profits
from
that
investment.
whether
they're
entitled
to
it
is
a
different
issue,
but--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--my
problem
is
the
following,
which
is
let's
assume
he
had
taken
the
money
and
lost
it
and
he
never
repaid
it.
what
does
it
matter
whether
he
thought
he
could
take
the
money
or
not?
i
thought
the
very
basic
definition
of
defalcation
in
every
dictionary
at
the
time
and
forever,
one
of
the
three
definitions
has
always
been
that
you
cause
a
loss
to
the
--
to
the
trust.
why
does
mental
state
matter
at
all,
is
my
bottom
line?
i
think
that
your
stronger
argument
is
that
loss
to
the
estate,
or
the
one
that
you
have
to
--
can
direct
your
attention
to,
is
what
is
the
loss
to
the
trust?
but
what
does
it
matter
whether
i
intended
to
lose
it
or
not
if
i
wasn't
entitled
to
lose
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
that's
justice
breyer's
point,
which
is
if
you
took
the
money
and
lost
it,
what
does
it
matter?
you
took
it.
unless
--
unless
you
were
drugged
and
didn't
know
that
you
were
taking
the
money
and
somebody
else
forced
you
to
in
some
--
under
some
sort
of
duress
defense,
some
outrageous
question
--
isn't
the
issue
the
one
that
justice
breyer
came
to?
if
you're
a
fiduciary,
why
should
an
excuse
of
ignorance
of
the
law
ever
save
you
when
you
are
required
to
exercise
the
highest
protection
of
the
trust?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
should
you
be
discharged
if
you
took
--
if
you
knowingly
did
an
act,
the
actus
reus,
with
its
concomitant
mental
state.
you
intended
to
take
the
money.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
give
me
your
best
answer
to
the
rule
that
we
should
write,
okay?
forgetting
that
i
don't
accept
that
you
need
a
mental
state,
okay?
let's
go
to
just
the
loss
issue.
if
i
agree
with
you
that
you
need
to
prove
the
loss,
this
is
a
very
unusual
trust,
because
the
measure
of
what
the
trust's
res
should
be
is
fixed.
it
was
the
amount
of
the
trust
plus
the
fixed
interest,
essentially.
this
is
a
very
unusual
trust.
in
the
norm,
the
trust
just
says
to
the
trustee,
invest
prudently.
and
the
trustee
self-deals
by
taking
the
res
out,
puts
the
investment
in
his
or
her
own
name
and
takes
the
profit.
in
that
situation,
how
would
you
measure
the
loss?
in
the
normal
self-dealing
where
the
trustee
just
has
to
invest
prudently
and
is
depriving
the
trust
of
that
investment
value,
would
you
say
in
that
situation
that
the
loss
is
measured
by
the
lost
opportunity?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
there
is
a
difference
between
what
the
trust
loses
and
the
gain
that
the
trustee
makes,
which
under
normal
trust
principles
the
gain
has
to
be
disgorged.
are
you
separating
out
those
two
things
and
how
are
you
separating
them
out
and
how
would
i
--
how
would
we
write,
the
court
write
this
opinion
to
give
loss
meaning?
what's
the
--
what's
the
meaning
you
want
to
give
it?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
under
your
theory,
the
profit
to
the
trustee
is
never
a
measurement.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
assume
that
that
is
distasteful,
because
for
all
the
reasons
the
government
argues
in
its
amicus
brief,
the
idea
that
a
trustee
could
self-deal
is
the
height
of
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
so
give
me
something
that
--
that
would
win
your
case
without
upsetting
the
fact
that
defalcation
somehow
should,
in
the
norm,
include
something
as
egregious
as
self-dealing.
you
don't
think
your
guy
did,
because
he
didn't
know,
but
let's
assume
the
worst
case.
the
guy
knew.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
does
it
matter
--
if
the
money
is
missing,
what
does
it
matter
the
reason
why
in
terms
of
recklessness
or
intent?
you
took
the
money.
justice
breyer
and
i
both
agree
you
intended
to
take
the
money.
so
why
are
you
adopting
the
need
for
recklessness,
unless
you're
trying
to
avoid
the
second
component
that
the
other
side's
talking
about,
which
is
that
you
caused
a
loss
to
the
trust?
because
that's
where
you
have
a
problem
here,
where
you
have
a
problem,
because
there
really
is
no
loss
to
the
trust
in
a
traditional
sense.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
the
problem
is
that,
yes,
there
was
a
breach
of
the
trust.
but
in
terms
of
the
terms
of
the
trust,
the
trust
got
every
penny
that
it
would
have
earned
if
the
money
had
not
been
taken.
it
got
the
trust
plus
the
fixed
6
percent
that
the
trust
was
entitled
to.
so
it
suffered
no
loss
in
its
traditional
sense.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
are
we
fighting
about
the
meaning
of
loss?
that's
really
the
question.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
are
we
fighting
about
what
loss
means?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
he
did.
this
is
the
unusual
part
of
this
trust,
which
is
that
by
the
terms
of
this
trust,
it
was
only
going
to
grow
at
principal
plus
a
fixed
interest.
most
trusts
are
not
written
this
way.
this
is
the
highly
unusual
trust,
where
it
never
--
should
have
made
more
money,
because,
taking
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
which
is
he
had
invested
it
and
just
gotten
the
interest
due,
why
would
there
be
a
defalcation?
what's
the
loss
opportunity
or
the
loss
that
you
would
have
suffered.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
yes.
but
let's
assume
a
different
fact
scenario,
that
he
didn't
make
$250,000,
that
he
happened
to
make
just
the
amount
of
the
interest
required,
and
he
paid
all
of
that
back
just
as
he
did
here,
what
would
have
been
the
defalcation
under
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i've
never
heard
of
a
defalcation
that
didn't
result
in
some
monetary
loss.
what
would
have
been
the
monetary
loss
in
the
chief's
hypothetical?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
would
you
just
repeat
what
you
said?
your
voice
turned.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
what
i
understood.
so
you're
saying
that
that
is
not
the
case?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
is
two
components
of
the
award,
the
attorney's
fees
plus
the
$250,000
profit.
and
you're
representing
to
me
right
now
that
as
a
trustee
he
was
entitled
to
invest
that
fund
for
the
trust?
and
so
there
was
a
lost
opportunity
here
as
well?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
it
your
position
that
he
couldn't
have
invested
this?
let's
assume
that
he
knew
--
that
he
knew.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
as
a
trustee
for
the
trust.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
okay.
then
you
may
be
losing
this
case.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
if
he
could
invest
it
for
the
trust,
why
isn't
the
loss
--
isn't
it
a
loss
for
the
trust
that
he
took
this
opportunity
away
from
the
trust?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
he
could
have.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
why
isn't
the
loss
of
opportunity?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
let's
assume
his
argument
that
he
could.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
then
we
have
to
go
back
to
--
to
the
first
issue,
whether
a
mental
state
is
required
or
not.
