i
--
i
assume
the
other
children
did
not
have
an
interest
in
the
business,
but
just
the
trustee
and
the
mother
did.
or
is
that
clear
from
the
record.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
briefs
--
the
briefs
on
your
side
of
the
case
say,
well,
you
know,
there
is
a
series
of
words
here:
fraud,
defalcation,
embezzlement,
larceny.
but
really,
fraud
and
defalcation
are
defined
in
a
further
way
where
embezzlement
and
larceny
are
not.
fraud
and
defalcation,
while
acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity,
then
embezzlement
and
larceny.
so
i'm
not
quite
sure
it's
there
to
say
that
all
four
words
must
be
consulted
for
the
use
of
generous
--
because
fraud
and
defalcation
are
qualified
by
“
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
”
and
then
a
comma.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
in
that
respect,
i
think
the
word
“
fraud
”
gives
you
some
assistance
in
arguing
your
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
there
a
finding
of
recklessness
in
the
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
crime
of
embezzlement
proven
if
you
show
recklessness
or
do
you
need
a
further
criminal
intent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that's
one
of
the
things
we
are
arguing
about
here.
i
don't
think
that's
conceded.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
a
number
of
embezzlers
--
not
all
of
them
--
many
embezzlers
fully
intend
to
pay
everything
back
once
things
turn
out
all
right.
but
there's
still
an
embezzlement.
but
there
is
also
a
criminal
intent
at
the
time,
or
a
wrongful
intent,
even
if
--
even
if
you
plan
to
pay
it
back.
and
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
standing
very
firm
on
the
fact
that
defalcation
means
something
different
than
fraud
in
the
first
clause,
or
embezzlement
and
larceny
in
--
in
the
following
clause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
problem
is,
as
the
--
your
friend
on
the
other
side
points
out,
that
there's
two
problems
with
this.
number
one,
it's
not
consistent
with
these
--
with
the
meaning
of
the
other
three
terms
in
the
--
in
the
statute;
and
two,
it's
not
consistent
with
the
idea
that
discharges
should
be
freely
given
so
that
debtors
can
begin
again.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
unlike
fraud
--
fraud,
larceny
and
embezzlement?
