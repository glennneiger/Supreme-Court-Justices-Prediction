chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
case
11-1518,
bullock
versus
bank
champaign.
mr.
byrne?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
it's
often
the
case
that
--
that
children
don't
want
to
go
into
the
family
business
and
it's
often
the
case
that
some
of
them
do
and
some
of
them
don't
and
the
idea
that
one
of
the
children
who
wants
to
put
the
money
back
in
the
family
business
is
--
you
know,
you
wouldn't
think
that
was
wrong
when
the
other
children
want
to
take
the
money
out
or
put
it
somewhere
else.
that's
not
at
all
unusual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
is
a
shortage
of
accounts
at
the
end
of
the
day.
it's
just
a
question
of
what
day
it
is.
when
he
takes
--
takes
the
stuff
and
it's
a
lost
--
it's
either
viewed
as
a
lost
opportunity
or
an
increase
in
the
risk
to
the
beneficiary,
and
that's
a
loss
to
them
at
that
point.
the
fact
--
it's
like
a
bank
robber
giving
back
the
money.
there
is
no
loss
to
the
bank,
but
it's
still
crime.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
bensinger?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
he
made
nothing
on
the
deal,
and
it
just
turns
out
he
got
whatever
the
--
the
trust
was
getting
under
its
interest
rate
and
gave
it
back,
there'd
be
no
defalcation,
because
there'd
be
no
loss
in
the
sense
of
a
lost
opportunity?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
kagan
to
be
that
you
--
there
must
be
a
loss,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
right.
does
there
have
to
be
a
loss
for
there
to
be
a
defalcation?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
taking
the
money
out
is
sufficient
for
defalcation
even
if
it's
brought
back
in
full
and
even
if
there
is
no
lost
opportunity.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
is
still
a
loss.
i
mean,
when
you're
investing
obviously
the
return
is
part
of
it,
but
also
the
question
is
what
risk
you
assume.
and
the
trust
would
have
suffered
because
during
that
period
they
were
incurring
a
greater
risk.
that's
one
reason
you
set
up
a
trust,
so
you
don't
--
you
protect
people
from
that
risk.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
gannon?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
byrne,
you
have
five
minutes
left.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
11-1518,
bullock
v.
bankchampaign.
