well,
before
we
get
to
the
various
candidates
for
applicable
mental
state,
if
there
is
one,
could
you
tell
me
what
this
mental
state
applies
to?
does
it
apply
to
facts
or
does
it
apply
to
law?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
recklessness
is
required?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
think
recklessness
is
required?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
recklessness
as
to
the
law,
as
to
what
the
law
requires
of
the
trustee.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
the
question
here
--
the
question
here
is
not
whether
the
trustee
is
liable.
yes,
the
trustee
is
liable.
the
question
is
whether
it's
dischargeable.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
you
look
at
the
other,
the
other
words
in
this
list,
fraud,
embezzlement,
larceny,
those
are
bad
acts.
there
is
a
degree
of
moral
culpability
involved
and
maybe
there
are
people
who
commit
fraud,
embezzlement
and
larceny
and
don't
realize
that
it's
illegal,
but
there
are
not
many.
it's
commonly
understood
that
those
are
bad.
so
in
a
very
impressionistic
sense,
there
is
a
difference
between
that
and
the
kind
of
conduct
that's
presented
to
us
here.
but
you
think
that's
irrelevant.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
what
about
a
reasonable
trustee
who
just
invests
very
imprudently,
an
unreasonable
trustee
who
invests
very
imprudently?
any
reasonable
trustee
would
realize
that
investing
in,
you
know,
the
widget
factory
totally
unrelated
to
him
is
a
really
bad
idea
and
money
is
lost
there.
what
about
that
trustee?
is
that
a
defalcation?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
could
you
explain
what
you
mean,
before
your
time
expires,
in
footnote
18?
i
understood
your
argument
until
i
got
there,
but
then
you
said
that
there
was
no
particular
mental
state
required.
and
then
in
footnote
18
you
said:
well,
there
may
be
cases
where
a
particular
mental
state
is
required.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
where
are
courts
supposed
to
look
to
find
out
what
is
the
border
between
the
heartland
of
defalcation
and
the
badlands
of
defalcation
and
whatever
else?
