mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner's
act
of
self-dealing
was
a
reckless
breach
of
his
fiduciary
duty
of
loyalty
and
was
therefore
a
defalcation.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
no,
your
honor.
there
was
not
a
finding
of
recklessness.
the
state
court
simply
found
that
the
debtor
engaged
in
self-dealing,
that
he
used
trust
assets
for
his
own
purposes
and,
thereby,
created
a
split,
a
conflict
of
interest
between
his
interest
and
the
interest
of
the
trust.
the
moment
that
he
made
those
loans,
there
is
an
absolute
certainty
that
there
would
be
a
conflict
of
interest
and
a
reasonable
person,
a
reasonable
trustee
in
the
petitioner's
position
would
not
have
made
those
loans,
because
the
risk
was
so
high,
nigh
on
an
absolute
certainly
that
there
would
be
this
conflict
of
interest,
and
that
has
been
the
harm
incurred
at
the
moment
he
made
the
loans,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
generally
speaking,
your
honor,
embezzlement
does
require
some
sort
of
specific
mental
intent,
an
intent
to
deceive
or
to
defraud.
but
defalcation
does
not
require
that
same
mental
intent
and
that's
borne
out
by
the
history.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
no,
your
honor,
it's
certainly
not
conceded,
but
it's
borne
out
in
the
history
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
defalcation
was
first
added
to
the
bankruptcy
act
in
1841
and
it
was
simply
an
exception
to
discharge
for
defalcation.
there
was
no
mention
of
fraud,
there
was
no
mention
of
embezzlement,
there
was
no
mention
of
larceny.
it
wasn't
until
1867
that
congress
in
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1867
that
congress
added
an
exception
to
discharge
for
embezzlement
and
for
fraud.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
yes,
your
honor.
recklessness
is
required
as
to
the
objective
act.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
recklessness
as
to
the
law,
correct,
your
honor,
but
also
as
to
the
act.
this
was
a
reckless
act.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
no,
your
honor,
and
i
apologize
if
i
misspoke.
all
that
is
required
is
an
intent
to
do
the
act
and
that's
what--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--your
honor,
fraud,
like
embezzlement,
does
require
a
specific
mental
intent,
but
defalcation
does
not.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
your
honor,
defalcation
must
mean
something
other
than
fraud.
the
statute
says
that--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--when
it's
described
like
that,
maybe,
your
honor.
[laughter]
however,
it
was
still
a
reckless
act,
your
honor,
in
that
a
reasonable
trustee--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--your
honor,
the
courts
have
traditionally
ascribed
--
most
courts
have
said
that
defalcation
does
require
some
form
of
reckless--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--your
honor,
that's
the
genesis
of
this
case.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
possibly
in
the
traditional
sense
there
might
not
have
been
a
loss,
but
there
was
a
loss
in
the
context
of
trust
law,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
used
trust
funds
for
his
own
benefit.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
maybe
not
in
the
traditional
sense,
but
in
the
context
of
a
fiduciary
obligation
a
trustee
is
not
allowed
to
benefit
from
his
position
as
trustee.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
is
what
the
illinois
state
court
found,
and
that
is
borne
out
also
by
the
other
exceptions
to
discharge
in
section
523(a)(4).
if
a
fraudster
commits
fraud,
he
doesn't
just
remedy
that
by
paying
back
what
he
took.
he
has
to
return
all
of
the
profits
that
he
has
obtained.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
it
is
irrelevant,
your
honor,
because
a
reasonable
trustee
would
not
act
this
way.
a
reasonable
trustee
would
know
that
the
moment
he
makes
loans
to
himself
he
has
created
a
conflict
of
interest
between
himself
and
his
trust.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
if
it's
unreasonable,
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
because,
first
of
all,
the
bankruptcy
court
never
made
any
specific
finding
of
facts.
those
were
allegations
that
were
included
in
--
in
the
record
of
the
district
court--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
petitioner
had
every
opportunity
to
bring
those
facts
into
--
into
evidence
at
the
bankruptcy
court
and
he
did
not.
there
are
facts
outside
the
record
as
there
are
on
both
sides
with
regard
to
this
issue,
why
the
trust
would
not
allow
subsequent
sales.
but
it
does
go
back
to
an
important
point,
and
that's
that
the
petitioner
did
have,
and
retains
today,
an
opportunity
to
go
back
to
state
court
and
seek
a
reduction
in
this
judgment
should
he
so
desire.
a
reduction
in
the
judgment
would
reduce
the
debt,
and
if
there
is
no
debt,
then
there
is
nothing
for
the
trust
to
collect
subsequent
to
this
discharge
or
subsequent
to
the
lack
of
discharge,
as
respondent
is
requesting.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
that
was
not
an
issue
that
ultimately
came
before
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bankruptcy
court
made
no
finding
of
facts.
there
were
only
allegations
on
appeal
to
the
district
court
and
to
the
eleventh
circuit,
your
honor.
however,
to
return
back
to
the
point
concerning
that
the
required
mental
intent
or
the
mens
rea,
both
in
the
petition
and
here
this
morning,
the
petitioner
has
not
been
able
to
articulate
exactly
what
mens
rea
is
required,
that
is,
what
mental
intent
is
required.
but
the
mental
intent
that
he
asked
is
that
it
be
something
greater
than
extreme
recklessness,
in
effect.
however,
that
cannot
work
in
the
code,
because
it
would
make
other
code
sections
superfluous.
specifically,
if
the
mental
intent
required
were
an
intent
to
cause
an
injury,
section
523(a)(6)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
already
accepts
from
discharge
debts
for
willful
and
malicious
injury.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
it
does,
your
honor.
defalcation
when
it
was
first
introduced
into
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1941
had
a
known
meaning,
and
that
known
meaning,
at
least
according
to
the
oxford
english
dictionary,
is
a
monetary
deficiency
through
breach
of
trust.
that
was
when--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--but,
your
honor,
the
subsequent
inclusion
of
the
terms
fraud,
embezzlement
and
larceny
cannot
retroactively
modify
or
change
the
known
definition
of
the
word
defalcation.
this
court
in
schwager
v.
northern
burlington
considered
two
sections
of
--
or
two
statutes
in
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
section
14(e)
and
section
10(b).
section
10(b)
was
the
first
enacted
statute.
section
14(e)
was
subsequently
enacted.
both
statutes
prohibited
a
manipulative
type
of
transaction
with
regard
to
securities.
section
14(e)
also
prohibited
a
fraudulent
act
with
regard
to
securities.
this
court
stated
in
that
case
--
while
it
wasn't
central
to
its
holding
--
the
court
did
state
that
the
inclusion
of
the
term
“
fraudulent
”
in
section
14(e)
could
not
modify
the
understanding
of
the
term
“
manipulative
”.
and
the
same
logic
applies
here.
the
subsequent
inclusion
of
the
terms
“
fraudulent
”
and
“
embezzlement
”
and
“
larceny
”
cannot
modify
the
known
meaning,
even
if
that
known
meaning
has
been
lost,
the
meaning
of
the
word
“
defalcation
”.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
your
honor,
there
was
a
monetary
deficiency
in
this
case
when
the--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--yes,
your
honor.
for
there
to
be
even
a
debt,
which
is
what
the
bankruptcy
code
discharges,
there
must
be
a
monetary
deficiency
in
this
case,
or
in
the
case
of
a
defalcation.
and
that
is
what
this
court--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
your
honor,
that
is
certainly
an
issue
that
the
parties
have
contested
in
the
briefs
before
this
court
and
in
the
courts
below,
whether
there
was
a
loss.
and
there
was
a
loss.
the
state
court
recognized
that
there
was
a
loss
in
the
amount
of
$250,000.
that
judgment
of
$250,000
creates
a
claim.
the
bankruptcy
code
at
section
101-5
defines
a
claim
as
a
right
to
payment.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
there
would
be
a
defalcation,
your
honor,
but
there
would
be
no
debt
in
that
case.
and
that
--
there
would
be
nothing--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--your
honor,
there
--
there
needs
to
be
a
loss
for
there
to
be
a
debt.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
no,
your
honor.
inconsistent
in
that
answer,
i
apologize.
i
did
not
intend
to
be.
there
must
be
a
loss
for
there
to
be
a
debt.
for
there
to
be
a
defalcation,
that
merely
goes
to
the
bad
act.
the
act
of
in
this
case
self-dealing.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
your
honor--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--no,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
in
this
case,
the
breach
of
trust,
the
self-dealing,
was
that
cutting
off
of
the--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
your
honor,
at
that
point,
there
was
a--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--your
honor,
the
loss
in
that
case
occurs
--
your
honor
is
absolutely
right
--
at
the
time
that
there
is
that
cutting
off,
at
the
time
in
this
case
the
petitioner
used
the
trust
assets
for
his
own
benefit.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
your
honor--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--because,
your
honor,
the
loss
occurred.
there
was
a
loss
in
the
amount
of
the
loans
that
he
took
out.
and
that
loss
was
compounded,
if
you
will,
your
honor,
by
the
petitioner's
failure
to
return
those
--
the
proceeds
of
those
loans--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--your
honor,
the
loss
that
the
trust
suffered
was
that
its
principal
was
taken
away,
was
it
invested
by
the
trustee
for
his
own
benefit--
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
--the
defalcation
there,
your
honor,
would
be
that
the
trustee
has
split
his
interest,
has
created
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
that
causes
a
loss.
there
might
not
be
a
monetary
--
a
straight
monetary
loss
at
that
time.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
in
that
case,
your
honor,
there
would
not
have
been
a
strict
monetary
loss
in
that
hypothetical
had
the
--
all
the
proceeds
--
had
there
not
been
any
benefit
that
the
trustee
obtained
from
the
investment
and
use
of
those
funds.
mr.
bill
d.
bensinger
that's
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you.
