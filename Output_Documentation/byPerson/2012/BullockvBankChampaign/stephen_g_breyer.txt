justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
--
could
you
go
back,
please,
to
justice
alito's
question?
i
--
i
don't
understand
the
answer
to
that.
that
is,
i
don't
understand,
and
it's
just
something
i
don't
understand.
i'm
not
saying
it
facetiously.
i
don't
understand
the
relationship
of
mental
state
to
the
issue.
i
mean,
i
didn't
think
there
is
any
doubt
here
that
the
individual,
your
client,
knew
what
he
was
doing.
he
knew
for
a
fact
that
he
was
taking
money
from
the
trust.
he
knew
he
was
giving
it
to
his
mother.
and
he
knows
where
it's
going.
and
he
knows
it
was
later
paid
back
with
6
percent
interest.
so
you
don't
have
to
assume
extreme
recklessness.
he
knew
it.
now,
what
he
didn't
know
was
that
that
was
unlawful.
and
therefore,
if
i
look
at
the
accompanying
things
--
embezzlement,
larceny,
fraud
in
the
trust
--
i
don't
think
any
of
them
require
a
knowledge
that
what
you're
doing
is
unlawful.
so
if
i
--
or
do
they?
i
don't
think
--
you
can
be
convicted
of
embezzlement
while
misunderstanding
the
law
of
embezzlement.
you
can
be
convicted
of
larceny,
it's
saying.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
a
person
to
commit
fraud
lies,
knows
it's
material,
knows,
et
cetera,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
know
there's
a
law
against
it.
and
--
and
so
--
if
i
do
what
justice
harlan
was
doing
and
comparing
it
to
the
other
three,
it
looks
as
if
you
don't
need
to
know
that
what
you're
doing
is
against
the
law,
where
you
commit
defalcation.
now,
that
i
think
is
what
justice
alito
was
driving
at.
and
i'd
like
to
hear
an
absolutely
clear
answer
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
didn't
think
there's
any
respect
here
in
which
missing,
mistake
of
law,
would
negate
the
mental
state
as
to
having
taken
money
from
the
trust,
used
it
in
the
family
business
and
then
paid
it
back,
which
i
take
it
are
--
we
assume,
which
is
a
different
question
i
have
--
but
for
present
purposes,
we
are
assuming
that
that's
sufficient
for
defalcation.
is
that
right?
where
is
it
--
and
where
does
it
negative
the
intent
in
respect
to
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
recklessness.
he
did
these
three
things
knowingly.
that
is
a
stronger
mental
state
than
recklessness,
not
a
weaker
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
were
unlawful.
so
we're
back
at
the
same
question,
and
i'm
now
assuming
you
have
no
answer
to
the
question
because
there
is
none.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
you
see
--
should
i
have
to
write
the
opinion
in
this
case,
i
would
have
to
deal
with
this
issue,
and
i'd
have
to
say
something
about
it.
and
as
soon
as
i
look
at
the
other
words,
those
are
words
like
“
embezzlement
”,
“
larceny
”
and
“
fraud
”.
now,
elsewhere
in
the
u.s.
code
where
those
are
crimes
ignorance
of
the
law
is
not
an
excuse.
it
often
is
an
excuse
where
in
fact
it's
a
tax
violation
or
some
other
technical
violation.
so
i
would
have
to
explain
why
the
word
“
defalcation
”
when
linked
to
those
three
is
being
treated
differently.
or
i'd
have
to
say
congress
used
words
which
never
have
ignorance
of
the
law
as
an
excuse
and
meant
them
differently.
each
of
those
is
pretty
hard
to
say.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
one
other
question
on
a
different
subject
that
may
be
more
helpful
to
you
or
not.
i
think
of
defalcation
as
the
individual
who
has
defalcated
shows
up
in
rio
with
two
suitcases
full
of
money,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
you
look
at
the
root
of
the
word,
it
consists
of
deminishing,
taking
a
sickle
and
cutting
something
down,
and
therefore
it
did
seem
to
refer
to
an
instance
where
you
take
the
corpus
or
money
belonging
to
the
trust
--
now
it
becomes
ambiguous
--
and
you
run
off
with
it.
is
there
anything
you
would
like
to
say
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait,
wait.
you
say
--
you
mean
either,
both?
i
mean,
there
is
no
doubt
here,
i
agree
with
you,
as
far
as
the
act
is
concerned.
it
wasn't
just
reckless,
it
was
intentional.
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
one.
thus
justice
kennedy's
basic
question
i'd
like
to
hear
your
answer
to.
i
thought
it
might
have
come
from
the
other
side,
but
you
concede,
i
take
it,
that
there
has
to
be
an
element
in
which
the
person
not
only
knows
what
he
has
done,
but
that
he
does
it
with
an
element
of
moral
turpitude;
i.e.,
he
knows
that
the
law
forbids
it
or
--
or
are
you
conceding
this
and
then
fill
in
the
blanks,
or.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
if
that's
your
position,
what
do
you
say
to
what
justice
kennedy
said,
add
in
justice
harlan's
comment
that
embezzlement
and
larceny
are
set
off.
these
two
concern
fraud
and
defalcation
in
respect
to
the
trust.
there
is
a
case
of
this
court
that
says
fraud
in
respect
to
the
trust
requires
an
element
of
moral
turpitude.
that
suggests
a
knowledge
that
what
you
are
doing
violates
the
law.
and
if
we
read
in
pari
materia,
we
get
the
same
kind
of
requirement
for
this,
indeed
more
so.
indeed,
you
just
conceded
it
existed
even
in
respect
to
embezzlement,
which
is
outside
the
parenthesis.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
defalcation
on
your
definition
would
seem
to
be
more
likely
to
be
thought
innocent
by
someone
who
commits
it
in
some
circumstances
than
would
fraud.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
it
may
mean,
for
example
here,
fine,
okay,
no
fraud,
but
what
you
did
was
you
took
some
money
that
belonged
to
the
trust
given
by
your
father
to
help
your
mother.
and
your
mother
says,
help
me,
and
the
brothers
and
sisters
will
benefit
well
too.
and
so
you
go
to
your
insurance
guy
and
he
says,
sure,
no
problem.
and
then,
lo
and
behold,
they
did
it.
i
mean,
innocence
just
radiates
from
what
the
conduct
was
as
described.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
--
before
we
leave
this
conduct,
i
mean,
i
understand
i
was
painting
you
a
picture
of
they're
being
innocent.
but
we
are
in
a
court
that
this
court
has
described
as
a
court
of
equity
or
akin
thereto.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
principle
i
used
to
learn
was
he
who
has
clean
hands
can
come
into
equity,
but
nobody
else.
now,
we
have
two
lower
courts
that
are
saying
your
client
has
pretty
dirty
hands
or
at
least
they
don't
understand
it;
that
this,
the
other
client
tried
to
get
him
to
sell
the
property,
but
they
write
the
properties
are
abandoned
and
uninsurable.
even
though
mr.
bullock
produced
a
buyer,
they
won't
sell
it.
and
so
do
you
have
clean
hands?
not
you
yourself.
you
didn't
take
the
money
and
you
do
not
have
dirty
hands,
all
right?
but
did
your
client
here
--
does
he
lack
clean
hands
because
two
courts
have
said
he
should
have
just
sold
his
collateral
and
he
would
have
gotten
the
money
and
saved
everybody
a
lot
of
trouble?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
we
remand
it
so
they
could?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
what's
the
loss?
i
mean,
let's
assume
the
trust
was
worth
$1
million
plus
6
percent,
and
every
year,
they
have
in
their
coffer
$1
million
plus
6
percent.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
only
part
they
don't
have
is
the
extra
money
that
the
trustee
made,
that
there
is
no
cutting
down
of
the
size
of
the
trust.
at
least
that's
an
argument.
now,
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
i
mean,
i
thought
defalcation
is
--
supposes
that
the
person
does
pack
his
suitcases
with
the
money
and
he
goes
and
shows
up
in
rio.
i
take
it
that
would
be
defalcation.
that
isn't
fraud.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
didn't
cite
to
the
latin,
did
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
didn't
have
the
latin
definition,
which
i
take
it
from
my
colleague
and
it
was
confirmed
by
my
law
clerk,
it
comes
from
medieval
latin,
starting
with
a
sickle
and
meant
to
cut
down,
to
cut
down,
and
that
suggested
reduction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
other
argument?
i
just
don't
want
you
to
leave
without
addressing
the
other
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
your
brief
you
talk
about
and
quote
learned
hand
and
say
it
means
--
"if
it
doesn't
mean
a
deliberate
malversation.
"
said
learned
hand--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
it
must
be
the
same
as
fraud
or
embezzlement.
so
i
will
go
look
up
“
malversation
”
as
soon
as
i
return
to
my
office,
and
i
will
get
that.
now,
the
other
argument
was,
yes,
fine,
a
loss;
two,
done
deliberately;
but
with
an
innocent
state
of
mind
because
he
didn't
understand
the
law.
justice
kennedy
quoted,
fraud
--
from
this
court,
that
fraud
in
bankruptcy
for
purposes
of
this
provision
requires
some
degree
of
moral
turpitude.
well,
that
suggests
that
you
aren't
innocent
in
respect
to
knowledge
that
it's
against
the
law.
what
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
1978,
the
father
of
the
petitioner,
the
petitioner
mr.
randy
bullock,
but
his
father
created
a
family
trust
that
had
a
single
asset.
a
life
insurance
policy
on
the
father's
life,
randy
was
the
trustee
and
randy
and
his
four
siblings
were
the
beneficiaries.
now,
the
policy
and
the
trust
instrument
permitted
the
trustee,
namely
randy,
to
borrow
money
against
the
policy's
value
and
randy
did
that.
once
he
did
it
because
his
father
asked
him
to
get
some
money
to
give
it
to
his
mother
who
used
it
for
the
family
business,
once
he
did
it
to
help
his
mother
and
randy
himself
by
a
mill
and
once
he
did
it
to
allow
his
mother
and
again
randy
himself
to
buy
other
real
property.
now,
randy
saw
that
all
of
the
money
was
eventually
paid
back
to
the
trust
along
with
6%
interest.
in
1999,
randy's
brothers
claimed
that
randy
had
violated
his
fiduciary
obligations
and
they
sued
him
in
state
court
and
the
state
court
said,
“randy
does
not
appear
to
have
had
a
malicious
motive
in
borrowing
funds
from
the
trust,
but
given
self-dealing,
which
it
certainly
was,
nonetheless,
the
court
required
him
to
pay
the
trust
back
money
that
he
had
made
from
his
borrowings.”
the
court
imposed
constructive
trust
on
various
assets
to
make
sure
randy
did
pay
those
debts
to
the
trust,
the
money
he
made
out
of
to
borrow.
randy
asked
the
new
trustee,
there
was
a
new
trustee
by
then,
the
bankchampaign
to
allow
him
to
liquidate
some
of
the
assets
so
he
would
have
money
to
pay
back.
bankchampaign
inexplicably
wouldn't
let
him
do
that
and
randy
then
said,
“i'm
bankrupt,”
then
he
went
into
federal
court.
now
with
all
that,
it
sort
of
been
interesting
story,
we're
now
at
the
legal
issue
in
the
case,
a
question
of
federal
law.
can
randy
discharge
in
bankruptcy
his
debts
to
the
trust?
why
not?
well,
the
bankruptcy
code
says
that
an
individual
cannot
obtain
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
from
a
debt
“for
fraud
or
defalcation
while
acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
embezzlement
or
larceny.”
are
the
underlying
debts
here
debts
for
defalcation?
oh,
that's
the
question
and
that
depends
upon
the
meaning
of
defalcation.
in
here,
in
particular,
it
depends
upon
we
think
that
the
state
of
mind
that
accompanied
randy,
the
trustees'
actions,
that
gave
rise
to
the
debt
for
his
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
what
is
the
state
of
mind
that's
necessary?
ever
since
1867
when
the
word
defalcation
first
found
its
way
into
the
bankruptcy
codes
exception
from
discharge
provision,
dictionary,
editors,
treatise
writers,
and
judges
have
disagreed
about
the
state
of
mind
question.
many
years
ago,
for
example,
judge
augustus
hand
wrote
that
the
relevant
“misappropriation
must
be
due
to
a
known
breach
of
the
duty
and
not
mere
negligence
or
a
mistake.”
the
judge
learned
at
hand
suggested
the
terms
“may
have
included
innocent
default.”
some
modern
courts
have
included
innocent
acts
within
the
scope
of
the
term,
other
insisted
on
conduct
that
is
objectively
reckless,
still
others
have
said
there
has
to
be
extreme
recklessness,
when
treatise
ends
its
discussion
of
the
topic
with
a
question
mark.
now,
we
have
to
answer
the
question
mark
and
we
base
our
answer
in
an
old
case
called
neal
versus
clark
written
for
the
court
by
the
first
justice
harlan
in
1878.
he
was
thinking
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
fraud
and
he
said,
“that's
created
by
fraud,”
or
those
who
are
reading
the
statute,
they're
right
next
to
embezzlement.
and
such
association,
he
said,
“justifies,
although
it
doesn't
imperatively
require,
the
conclusion
that
the
fraud
means
positive
fraud
or
fraud
in
fact
involving
moral
turpitude,
that's
a
little
easier
to
understand,
or
intentional
wrong
as
does
embezzlement
and
not
implied
fraud
or
fraud
in
law
which
may
exist
without
bad
faith
or
immorality.”
we
think
the
statutory
term
defalcation
should
be
treated
exactly
really
pretty
much
the
same
way.
so,
if
the
conduct
that
issued
does
not
involve
bad
faith,
moral
turpitude
or
immoral
conduct,
then
it
requires
an
intentional
wrong.
justices
require
for
the
statutory
neighbors,
embezzlement,
larceny,
and
fiduciary
fraud.
we
include
its
intentional
here,
not
only
conduct
that
fiduciary
knows
is
wrong,
but
also
reckless
conduct
of
the
kind
the
criminal
law
often
treats
as
the
equivalent
of
intentional
conduct
or
actual
knowledge
of
wrong
doing
is
missing.
the
conduct
is
still
the
same
if
a
fiduciary
can
consciously
disregard
or
is
willfully
belong
to
a
substantial
and
unjustifiable
risk
that
his
conduct
will
turn
out
to
violate
a
fiduciary
duty.
and
that
risk
has
to
be
of
such
in
nature
and
degree
is
considering
the
nature
and
purpose
of
his
act
--
of
his
conduct
and
all
of
his
circumstances
its
disregard
involves
a
gross
deviation
from
the
standard
of
conduct
that
a
law
abiding
person
would
observe
in
his
situation.
security's
law
is
somewhat
similar,
so
a
fairly
simple
answer
to
a
long-lined
up
question.
in
our
view,
this
interpretation
maintains
linguistic
harmony.
it
provides
each
word
in
the
statute
with
a
distinct
meaning
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
statute's
purpose.
we
explained
all
that
further
in
our
opinion,
if
you
want
to
read
it,
and
the
decision
is
unanimous.
