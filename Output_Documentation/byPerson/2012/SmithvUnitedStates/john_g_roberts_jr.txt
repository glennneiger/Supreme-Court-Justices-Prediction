chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
11-8976,
smith
v.
united
states.
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
--
i'm
sorry.
finish
your
answer.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
argument
basically
reduces
to
the
fact
that
when
it
comes
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
you
treat
the
conspirators
as
individuals
rather
than
as
members
of
the
conspiracy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
not
true
with
respect
to
other
aspects
of
the
conspiracy.
if
members
of
the
conspiracy
commit
a
murder
and
it
was
anticipated
and
all
that,
the
person
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
other
than
being
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
is
liable,
criminally
liable
for
that
as
well.
why
is
there
a
special
rule
for
statutes
of
limitations?
why
is
he
treated
as
an
individual
rather
than
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
my
point
is
that
once
you
prove
the
conspiracy,
a
member
who
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
actually
participate
in
the
activities
of
the
conspiracy
is
still
responsible
for
them.
so
it
makes
sense
to
say
you
can
prove
the
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy,
not
with
respect
to
each
individual.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
why
it's
very
difficult
to
put
the
burden
on
the
government,
because
the
people
--
he
says,
well,
i
told
so
and
so
i'm
out
of
this
business,
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
any
more.
and
so
the
government,
if
they
had
the
burden
of
proof,
would
say,
well,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
want
to
call
the
person
you
talked
to.
and
the
person
says,
well,
i'm
not
going
to
testify
because
i
take
my
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
there
is
no
way
the
government
--
in
many
cases
there
would
be
no
way
the
government
can
carry
this
burden
of
proof.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
having
trouble
understanding
how
this
works.
you
said
a
while
ago
that
the
government
has
--
doesn't
have
to
do
anything?
in
other
words,
he
puts
on,
he
says,
"i
withdrew.
"
"and
i
told
this,
the
head
of
the
conspiracy
that
i
wanted
no
more
part
of
it.
"
and
the
head
of
the
conspiracy
says,
"well,
i'm
not
going
to
testify.
"
and
then
the
government
doesn't
have
to
do
anything?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
how
is
that
--
how
is
that
carrying
the
burden
that
you
say
is
on
it
to
prove
the
absence
of
withdrawal
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
just
sits
there
and
doesn't
say
anything,
they
will
never
be
able
to
carry
their
burden.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
they
have
already
done
that.
that's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
no,
no.
my
hypothetical
is
because
we
are
talking
about
the
criminal
conspiracy,
and
the
idea
is
did
he
tell
those
people
he
was
out.
they're
probably
going
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
testify.
and
so
--
and
you
say,
well,
the
government
still
doesn't
have
to
do
anything.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
say
that
they've
carried
their
burden
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
if
they
have
nothing
to
say
about
an
issue
as
to
which
you
say
they
have
the
burden
of
proof.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
believe
what
evidence?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
can't
be
any
evidence
because
nobody
is
willing
to
testify
under
--
because
they
invoked
their
fifth
amendment
rights.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
the
defendant
does
testify,
and
he
says,
i
told
the
ringleader
i
want
out,
is
an
attack
on
his
credibility
sufficient
to
prove
the
absence
of
withdrawal
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
harrington.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
what
if
it
is?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
is
charged
in
the
indictment?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
what
he's
saying
is
that
it
wasn't
proven
to
be
within
the
limitations
period
with
respect
to
him.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
you've
indicted
--
you
haven't
indicted
a
conspiracy.
you've
indicted
an
individual,
and
it's
not
clear
to
me
why
you
don't
have
to
show
that
that
individual's
conduct
was
within
the
statute
of
limitations
period.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
at
least
when
he
comes
forward
with
--
under
the
burden
of
production
with
evidence
suggesting
the
opposite.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
mr.
kramer
says
it's
not
that
big
a
deal,
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
do
--
he
says
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
at
all.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
kennedy.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
all
of
this
is
questions
for
the
jury
under
--
under
the
petitioners'
view,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
that
last
point
seems
to
me
spurious
itself,
because
to
prove
withdrawal,
he's
got
to
accept
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
conspiracy
in
the
first
place.
so
if
he
doesn't
have
a
good
withdrawal
defense,
it's
unlikely
that
he
would
raise
it,
because
it
would
cost
him
any
argument
he
has
against
participation
in
a
conspiracy
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
mean,
that
works
in
a
civil
case,
but
i
mean,
in
a
criminal
case,
it's
kind
of
a
big
thing
to
say
--
begin
my
first
argument
is
that
"i
withdrew
from
this
horrendous
conspiracy
that's
been
going
on.
"
or
--
"and
then
i
wasn't
a
part
of
it
after
that.
"
that's
a
little
different
in
a
criminal
context.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
--
you
have
to
prove
that
every
defendant
did?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
let
me
--
so
you
charge
ten
people
as
participating
in
this
conspiracy
and
the
jury
determines
that
one
wasn't,
then
everybody's
off
the
hook?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
you
don't
have
to
prove--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
have
to
treat
them
as
individuals.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
which
is
what
your
friend
is
trying
to
argue
for
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
when
you
say
it
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference
in
this
case,
you're
basically
saying
you
had
some
good
evidence.
but
a
jury
could
have
always
decided
against
you,
right?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
i
think
it's
a
little
much
to
say
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference
because
the
jury
would
definitely
have
ruled
in
your
favor.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
ms.
harrington.
mr.
kramer,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
scalia
has
the
opinion
of
the
court
this
morning
in
case
11-8976,
smith
versus
united
states.
