justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
--
is
that
an
element
of
the
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
raised
by
the
defendant,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
means
it's
not
an
element.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
charged
in
the
indictment.
now,
how
can
something
that
goes
to
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
an
affirmative
defense
be
an
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
you
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
was
knowing
and
willfully
a
member
of
the
conspiracy,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
agree
that
that's
the
rule
of
law,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
duress
eliminate
willfully?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
different
from
this?
if
that's
not
an
element,
for
pete's
sake,
even
though
the
definition
of
the
crime
is
knowingly
and
willfully,
and
yet,
nonetheless,
that's
--
that's
an
affirmative
defense,
why
is
that
any
different
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
between
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
prove
that
he
withdrew.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
of
those
are
affirmative
actions?
i
mean,
the
law
is
that
he
has
to
take
an
affirmative
action
withdrawing
from
the
conspiracy.
i
don't
think
being
in
jail
is
--
is
an
affirmative
action.
i
don't
think
being
mad
at
the
ringleader
is
an
affirmative
action.
i
don't
think
any
of
the
things
you've
said
amount
to
an
affirmative
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
not.
but
it
--
it
may
mean
that
we
are
wasting
our
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
have
to
prove
within
the
limitations
period.
they
didn't
have
to
prove
that.
you
acknowledged
that
that
the
--
look,
what's
at
issue
here
is
not
a
defense
of
withdrawal.
it's
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
that
is
an
affirmative
defense.
and
you
are
arguing
that
what
establishes
that
affirmative
defense
in
this
case,
namely,
withdrawal
is
an
element.
how
--
how
can
something
that
is
--
that
does
nothing
more
than
establish
an
affirmative
defense
be
an
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
understand
that.
can
you
give
me
any
other
example
in
the
criminal
law
where
--
where--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
not
an
affirmative
--
i
want
an
example
of
something
which
is
an
affirmative
defense
and
where
the
proof
of
that
affirmative
defense
becomes
an
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it
have
to
be
contained
in
the
indictment
if
it's
an
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
up
to
the
defendant
to
raise
it
if
it's
an
element?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
at
least
is
logical.
i'm
not
sure
it's
right.
but
it's
logical.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
government
doesn't
have
to
prove
within
the
statutory
period.
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
raise
that
defense,
and
if
he
doesn't
raise
it,
it's
waived.
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
the
government
charge
in
the
indictment
that
the
conspiracy
existed
during
this
five-year
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
during
the
particular
five-year
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
have
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
did
not
have
to,
it
would
have
been
up
to
the
defendant
to
say:
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
on
my
participation,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
--
it
didn't
say
the
conspiracy
only
existed
within
that
five-year
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume
it
did.
would
--
would
--
let's
say
in
a
burglary
indictment,
let's
say
the
burglary
occurred
seven
years
ago
and
there
is
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations.
if
the
indictment
just
--
just
accuses
the
individual
of
conducting
a
burglary
seven
years
ago,
is
that
--
is
that
indictment
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
--
it's
up
to
the
defendant
to
say,
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--seven
years
is
too
long.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
government's
statement
that
the
conspiracy
existed
within
this
five-year
period
causes
that
to
be
an
element
of
the
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wish
i
had
--
we
had
the
supervening
indictment.
of
course,
it's
--
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
--
it's
described
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
follows:
"according
to
the
indictment
in
the
district
court
and
the
evidence
of
the
united
states
at
trial,
during
the
late
1980s
and
1990s
appellants
rodney
moore,
kevin
gray,
john
raynor,
calvin
smith,
timothy
handy,
and
lionel
nunn,
along
with
others,
some
of
whom
were
also
indicted
but
tried
separately,
conspired
to
conduct
and
did
conduct
an
ongoing
drug
distribution
business
in
washington.
"
so
apparently,
according
to
that
description,
it
--
it
was
not
charged
as
a
conspiracy
during
those
5
years.
it
was
just
charged
as
a
conspiracy.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
so
it
would
have
been
up
to
the
defendant
to
prove
that
the
statute
of
limitations
barred
--
barred
his
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
jackalope,
maybe.
i
never
heard
of
a
rabbit-duck.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
insanity.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
this
thing
doesn't
come
up
in
the
--
in
the
statute
of
limitations
context.
suppose
it
comes
up
in
the
context
of
whether
this
defendant
is
liable
for
an
act
committed
by
the
coconspirators
after
he
withdrew.
so
it's
the
same
issue
of
whether
--
whether
he
withdrew
or
not
before
the
murder
of
somebody,
okay.
he
said,
you
know,
before
that
occurred,
i
was
out
of
the
conspiracy.
what
do
our
cases
say
about
--
about
proving
it
in
that
context?
is
the
burden
on
the
defendant
or
is
the
burden
on
the
prosecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
he
could
present
his
defense
in
the
alternative.
"i
didn't
belong
to
the
conspiracy.
"
"and
anyway,
i
withdrew.
"
i
mean,
he
can
make
both
of
those
points,
can't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
petitioner,
smith,
was
indicted
for
crimes
connected
to
his
role
in
an
organization
that
distributed
illegal
drugs
in
washington,
d.c.
for
about
a
decade.
among
other
things,
he
was
charged
with
two
conspiracy
crimes.
one,
conspiracy
to
distribute
narcotics
and
to
poses
narcotics
with
the
intent
to
distribute
in
violation
of
21
u.s.c.
section
846.
and
two,
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
to
conspiracy,
rico,
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1962(d).
at
trial,
smith
argued
that
the
conspiracy
counts
were
barred
by
the
applicable
five-year
statute
of
limitations
which
is
18
u.s.c.
section
3282
because
he
was
no
longer
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
on
the
earliest
date
as
to
which
that
statute
permitted
prosecution.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
“the
relevant
date
for
purposes
of
determining
the
statute
of
limitations
is
the
date,
if
any,
on
which
a
conspiracy
concludes
or
a
date
on
which
that
defendant
withdrew
from
that
conspiracy.”
over
the
defense's
objection,
the
court
also
instructed
the
jury
that
“once
the
government
has
proven
that
a
defendant
was
a
member
of
a
conspiracy,
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
prove
withdrawal
from
a
conspiracy
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.”
the
jury
convicted
smith
of
the
conspiracy
counts
and
the
d.c.
circuit
affirmed
those
convictions,
we
granted
certiorari,
and
today,
affirmed
the
d.c.
circuits'
judgment.
petitioner
asserts
that
once
he
presented
some
evidence
that
he
ended
his
membership
in
the
conspiracy,
prior
to
the
statute
of
limitations
cut
off,
it
became
the
government's
burden
to
disprove
his
affirmative
defense
of
withdrawal.
this
position
draws
support
neither
from
the
constitution
nor
from
the
conspiracy
and
limitations
statutes
at
issue
here.
allocating
to
the
defendant,
the
burden
of
proving
withdrawal,
does
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
our
precedent
established
that
unless
an
affirmative
defense
negates
an
element
of
the
crime,
the
government
has
no
constitutional
duty
to
overcome
the
defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
withdrawal
does
not
negate
an
element
of
the
conspiracy
crimes
charged
here,
it
terminates
a
defendant's
liability
for
his
co-conspirators'
post-withdrawal
acts
but
he
remains
guilty
of
conspiracy.
moreover,
withdrawal
that
occurs
before
the
earliest
date
on
which
the
statute
of
limitations
permits
prosecution
does
not
render
the
underlying
conduct
non-criminal
but
merely
non-prosecutable.
thus,
while
union
of
withdrawal
with
a
statute
of
limitations
defense
can
free
a
defendant
of
criminal
liability,
it
does
not
place
upon
the
prosecution
a
constitutional
responsibility
to
prove
that
the
defendant
did
not
withdraw.
as
with
other
affirmative
defenses,
the
burden
is
on
him.
of
course
even
though
the
constitution
does
not
place
the
burden
on
the
prosecution,
congress
may
do
so
by
statute.
it
did
not
do
so
here.
neither
conspiracy
statute
at
issue
addresses
the
burden
of
proof
for
withdrawal,
so
it
is
presumed
that
the
common
law
rule
subsists.
affirmative
defenses
are
for
the
defendant
to
prove.
the
analysis
does
not
change
when
withdrawal
is
the
basis
for
a
statute
of
limitations
defense.
in
that
circumstance,
the
government
need
only
prove
that
the
conspiracy
continued
past
the
statute
of
limitations
cut
off.
the
burden
of
establishing
withdrawal
before
that
cut
off
rests
upon
the
defendant.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
the
court's
decision
is
unanimous.
