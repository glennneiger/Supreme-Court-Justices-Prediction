ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court::
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
the
government
to
disprove
withdrawal
outside
the
limitations
period,
because
lack
of
withdrawal
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy.
this
court
has
been
clear
that
the
winship
burden
attaches
to
only
things
that
are
elements
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and
when
something
is
an
element
in
the
constitutional
sense,
then
at
least
four
consequences
follow.
as
the
court
has
suggested,
first,
the
government
has
to
allege
in
the
indictment
in
every
case.
second,
the
government
has
to
prove
it
in
every
case.
third,
the
jury
has
to
be
instructed
on
it
in
every
case.
and
fourth,
a
defendant
can't
waive
the
requirement
that
it
be
proved
in
his
case
by
failing
to
raise
it.
but
none
of
those
things
apply
as
to
a
statute
of
limitations.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
correct.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
so
i
guess
i
have
two
responses.
the
first
is
that
it
is
a
statute
of
limitations
question
in
the
sense
that
the
government
proved,
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
this,
that
the
conspiracy
that
was
charged
did
exist
within
the
limitations
period.
and
so,
the
question
is
just,
did
this
particular
member
of
the
conspiracy--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--he
does,
and
there's
no--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--and
an
--
but
when
petitioner
talks
about
the
membership
or
participation
element,
what
he
is
really
talking
about
is
the
agreement
element.
the
government
has
to
prove
that
each
defendant
who
is
charged
with
a
conspiracy
intentionally
agreed
to
join
the
conspiracy.
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
government
proved
that
with
respect
to
petitioner--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
again,
the
element
is
agreement.
right?
so
we
prove
that
he
agreed
to
join
the
conspiracy,
and
we
proved
that
each
defendant
agreed
to
join
the
conspiracy.
we
don't
have
to
prove
that
that
agreement
happened
in
the
limitations
period,
as
long
as
we
prove
that
the
conspiracy
continues
to--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
we
know
it's
not
an
element
for
the
reasons
i
explained,
because
it
doesn't
have
to
be
charged
in
the
indictment,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
proved
in
every
case,
the
defendant
can
waive
it.
so
it's
not
an
element
in
the
constitutional
sense
for
all
of
those
reasons.
we
can
also
tell
that
in
the
specific
conspiracy
context,
it's
not
an
element
because
this
court's
decision
in
hyde
from
1912,
in
that
case
the
defendant,
mr.
schneider,
who
had
raised
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
had
not
done
anything
to
participate
in
the
charged
conspiracy
within
what
was
then
a
three-year
statute
of
limitations
period.
the
jury
was
charged,
he
didn't
do
anything,
the
court
said
he
didn't
do
anything.
the
court
said:
it's
fine,
he's
still
a
member
of
the
conspiracy,
because
he
has
not
taken
an
affirmative
act
to
withdraw
from
the
conspiracy.
so,
that's
now
we
know
that
some
sort
of
active
membership
isn't
an
element
of
the
crime,
as
long
as
the
government
has
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
joined
the
crime
at
some
point
and
that
the
--
joined
the
conspiracy
--
excuse
me
--
at
some
point
and
that
the
conspiracy
continued
to
exist--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
did
not
have
to
do
that,
but
there's
no
dispute--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--to
be
clear,
i'm
not
sure
it
specifically
used
that
phrase,
but
it
charged
--
it
charged
overt
acts
that
were
part
of
the
conspiracy
that
happened
within
the
five-year
period.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i'm
not
sure
what
--
i'm
not
sure
exactly
the
language
that
is
used
in
the
indictment,
but
it--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--this
court
--
this
court
has
held
since
the
cook
case
that
the
--
the
government
does
not
have
to
charge
that
satisfaction
of
the
limitations
period
in
the
indictment.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it's
up
to
the
defendant--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--to
raise
it,
right.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
i
think
this
part
has
been
clear,
that
it
doesn't
cause
it
to
be
an
element
of
the
crime.
i
mean,
back
as
far
as
the
cook
case,
the
court
said
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
--
timing
is
not
an
element,
is
not
of
the
essence
of
these
crimes,
and
so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
charged
in
the
indictment.
and
again--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
what
if
it
is?
of--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--then
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
cause
it
to
be
an
element
of
the
crime.
i
think
again
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
government
proved
that
the
conspiracy
did
exist
within
the
limitations
period.
i
don't
think
petitioner
is
contesting
that.
what
he
is
saying
is
that
he
wasn't
a
part
of
that
conspiracy
within
the
limitations
period.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
true,
but
once
the
--
it's
true
that
that's
his
argument,
but
once
the
government
has
proved
that
he
willingly
joined
the
conspiracy,
which
it
did
in
this
case,
then
the
law
presumes
that
every
person
who
has
willingly
joined
the
conspiracy
remains
a
member
of
an
ongoing
conspiracy
unless
or
until
he
takes
some
affirmative
action
to
withdraw
from
the
conspiracy.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
it
can't--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
mean,
i
think
it
can't
be
an
element
of
the
crime
because
if
the
defendant
doesn't
raise
it,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
prove
it
or
disprove
it,
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it.
so--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--you
have
to
prove
membership--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
withdrawal
does
not
negate
membership,
because
again,
membership
is
really
just
the
agreement,
and
in
fact
a
withdrawal
defense
tends
to
confirm
that
a
particular
defendant
agreed
to
join
a
conspiracy,
because
there
is
nothing
to
withdraw
from
if
he
didn't
join--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it's
true,
but
the
government
has
to
prove
that
the
defendant
joined
the
conspiracy
and
the
conspiracy
continued
to
exist
and
to
bring
you
back
to
the
hyde--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--this
court
stated
in
grunewald
that
the
government
bears
the
burden.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
right.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
we
don't
have
to
prove
that
he
--
that
the
agreement
happened
in
the
limitations
period
or
that
any
particular
defendant
did
something
to
sort
of
re-agree
within
the
limitations
period;
and
that
again
is
clear
from
this
court's
decision
in
hyde,
where
in
that
case
the
defendant
raising
the
limitations
defense
had
not
done
anything
related
to
the
conspiracy
within
the
limitations
period.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
well,
what
the
statute--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--it
--
that
is
the
simplified
version
of
his
argument.
i
think
if
you
look
at--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--okay.
well,
if
you
look
at
section
--
if
you
look
at
section
3282,
which
is
the
statute
of
limitations,
it
says
that
the
crime--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--what
we
have
to
prove
is
that
the
crime
was
committed
within
the
limitations
period.
we
proved
that
the
crime
was
committed
within
the
limitations
period
because
the
conspiracy
existed
in
the
limitations
period.
by
operation
of
law,
anyone
who
has
willingly
joined
the
conspiracy
at
some
point
remains
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
unless
or
until
he
takes
an
affirmative
step
to
withdraw.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
absolutely.
the
way
the
statute
of
limitations
defense
operates
within
the
conspiracy
context
is
it
asks
the
question
whether
and
when
a
conspiracy
was
complete.
but
--
but
the
affirmative
defense
of
withdrawal
is
actually
an
affirmative
defense
even
within
that
affirmative
defense,
because
it
asks
the
question
whether
a
conspiracy
was
complete
as
to
a
particular
defendant.
and
to
take
advantage
of
that
affirmative
--
affirmative
defense
within
an
affirmative
defense,
the
defendant
has
to
take
some
affirmative
act,
and
it
makes
sense
to
require
him
to
prove
that
he
took
those
acts.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it's
very
long.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it
was
charged
as
an
ongoing
conspiracy.
it
started
before
the
beginning
of
the
limitations
period.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that's
right.
that's
why--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--that's
really
a
rabbit.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
insanity
is
another.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
extreme
emotional
disturbance.
just
a
constitutional
matter,
this
court
held
in
patterson
that
the
government
didn't
need
to
disprove
that.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
the
view
established
by
this
court
is
that
the
crime
of
conspiracy
continues,
and
once
a
person
joins
the
conspiracy
he
or
she
is
liable
for
all
the
acts
of
his
co-conspirators
that
were
reasonably
foreseeable
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy;
and
that
is
true
even
if
that
person,
once
he
joins
the
conspiracy,
doesn't
ever
do
anything
else--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--that's
right.
and
the
petitioner's
view
is
grounded
in
due
process
concerns.
our
view
is
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
due
process
because
lack
of
withdrawal
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy.
so
once
you
take
due
process
out
of
the
equation,
then
you
have
to
ask
what
--
where
would
congress
have
understood
the
burden
--
the
allocation
of
burdens
to
be
when
it
enacted
these
conspiracy
statutes
in
1970?
and
as
a
matter
of
logic,
as
a
matter
of
history,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
congress
would
have
thought
the
burden
of
persuasion
to
be
anywhere
other
than
on
the
defendant.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
this
court
has
said
the
opposite,
has
said
that,
you
know,
people
can
come
and
go
in
a
conspiracy
and--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--that's
right.
and
again,
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
conspiracy
was
ongoing.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
because
once--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--well,
again,
if
we
can
take
the
due
process
part
off
the
table
because
we
think
it's
not
an
element
of
lack
of
withdrawal,
then
you
ask
sort
of,
you
know,
what
--
how
would
congress
have
understood
the
state
of
the
law
to
be
when
it
enacted
these
crimes,
that's
how
the
court
approached
this
question
as
to
duress
in
dixon.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
logic,
because
the
government
can
prove
that
someone
is
liable
for
a
conspiracy
by
proving
that
he
joined
a
conspiracy
at
some
point
and
that
the
conspiracy
existed
in
the
limitations
period,
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
require
the
government
to
disprove
withdrawal
once
it's
asserted--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--i
think
that's
kind
of
a
remarkable
assertion.
if
what
he's
saying
is
we
have
to
be
disprove
withdrawal
once
the
defendant
asserts
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
it's
hard
to
imagine
why
the
government
would
ever,
once
a
defendant
makes
a
prima
facie
case
of
withdrawal,
when
the
government
would
ever
just
say,
"oh,
well,
we'll
sort
of
rest
on
our
laurels
and
rest
on
the
--
the
evidence
we
have
proving
that
he
joined
the
conspiracy
outside
the
limitations
period.
"
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
your
cases
don't
say
anything
about
that.
our
view
is
that
the
burden
would
be--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--your
cases
don't
say
anything
about
that
question,
so
our
view
would
be
that
the
--
the
burden
stays
on
the
defendant
to
prove
that
he
withdrew
from
a
conspiracy
in
that
context.
the
pinkerton
liability
isn't
at
issue
here,
so
you
don't
need
to
--
to
wrap
that
up
into
this
case,
but
our
--
our
view
would
be
the
same.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
no,
we
--
we
do
rely
on
that.
that's
mentioned
in
our
brief,
at
the
back
end
of
the
brief
where
we
talk--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--no,
i
think
it
is
dispositive.
and
that
was
the
reason
we
gave
for
the
court
to
deny
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
because
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
this
defendant
was
in
fact
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
there's
evidence
that
the
leaders
of
the
conspiracy
gave
him
drugs
and
money.
first
of
all,
there's
evidence
that
the
reason
he
went
to
prison
was
to
help
out
the
leader
of
the
conspiracy.
there
was
evidence
he
was
paid
back
because
they
gave
him
drugs
and
money
while
he
was
in
prison.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
yes,
certainly.
i
mean,
under
--
under
both
views,
you
know,
it
all
--
all
the
evidence
goes
to
whether,
you
know,
he
had
joined
the
conspiracy
and
whether
he
proved
withdrawal.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
not.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it's
never
an
element.
it
is
true
that
the
government,
if
a
defendant
raises
a
statute
of
limitations
defense,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
crime
was
committed
within
the
limitations
period.
this
court
said
that
in
grunewald.
it
did
not
offer
any
explanation
for
that,
but
we
have
accepted
that
as
our
burden.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
think
just
because
it
is
an
--
it
is
a
burden
that
is
placed
on
the
government
by
congress
in
section
3282.
i
think
--
i
think
a
reason
one
could
think
that
it
makes
sense
is
that
the
government
already
has
to
prove
all
the
things
that
it
needs
to
prove
to
prove
that
the
crime
actually
happened.
and
generally,
in
proving
that
a
crime
actually
happened
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
you
also
prove
when
the
crime
actually
happened.
and
so
it
doesn't
really
add
very
much
to
what
the
government's
burden
already
is
in
proving
the
crime.
but
that
sort
of
leads
me
into
sort
of
the
policy
reasons
for
not
allocating
a
burden
of
persuasion
to
the
government
as
to
the
issue
of
withdrawal.
and
there
are
sort
of
four
big
reasons
why
congress
wouldn't
have
understood
the
burden
to
be
--
for
policy
reasons
--
wouldn't
have
understood
the
burden
to
be
on
a
defendant
as
to
the
issue
of
withdrawal.
the
person
--
the
defendant
will
almost
always
be
in
a
better
position
to
have
the
information
about
whether
he
withdrew
except
in
cases
where
he
withdraws
by
making
a
clean
rest
with
the
government,
in
which
case
it's
hard
to
imagine
he's
going
to
be
indicted
for
--
for
the
indictment
past
that
period,
except
in
those
cases
he
will
know
what
he
said
in
secret
to
his
coconspirators.
second,
the
government
will
also
be
prevented
from
bringing
up
evidence
to
rebut
an
assertion
of
withdrawal,
because
it
can't
make
a
defendant
testify
and
it
often
won't
be
able
to
make
his
coconspirators
testify.
third,
a
defendant
doesn't
have
to
give
any
advanced
notice
of
his
intention
to
rely
on
a
withdrawal
defense
and
so
often,
he
can
scuttle
the
defendant's
--
the
government's
ability
to
procure
any
other
evidence
it
may
be
able
to
procure
relevant
to
the
issue
of
--
of
withdrawal.
and
fourth,
petitioner's
rule
would
encourage
spurious
assertions
of
withdrawal,
because
it
has
--
it
could
have
the
effect
of
essentially
making
the
government
prove
something
extra.
it
already
has
to
prove
that
he
joined
the
conspiracy
willingly,
that
the
conspiracy
existed
in
the
limitations
period,
but
under
the
government's
--
under
the
petitioner's
rule
--
excuse
me
--
the
government
would
also
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
essentially
took
some
other
act
to
show
his
membership
or
somehow
re-agreed
to
the
conspiracy--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--but
in
cases
where
--
such
as
this
where
a
defendant
goes
through
a
period
of
inaction
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy,
which
this
court
said
in
hyde
is
not
enough
to
withdraw,
then
there
would
be
an
incentive
to
raise
a
spurious
assertion
of
withdrawal,
because
it
would
require
the
government
to
sort
of
--
to
rebut
that
by
proving
that
the
defendant
had
done
something
within
that
period,
which
it
doesn't
have
to
prove
in
order
to
establish
liability.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
he
certainly
can.
i
think
there's
a
good
deal
of
risk
in
that
for
a
defendant.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
it's
true.
and
the
theory
of
defense
in
this
case
was
in
fact
that
there
were
many
separate
conspiracies,
not
that
any
particular
person
had
withdrawn,
and
it
only
came
up,
as
my
friend
pointed
out,
because
the
jury
asked
a
question
about
it.
if
i
can
just
sort
of
wrap
up
on
a
--
on
a
broader
note.
a
defendant
does
not
become
liable
for
a
criminal
conspiracy
casually.
as
the
jury
was
charged
in
this
case,
the
government
has
to
prove
that
every
defendant
was
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy,
that
every
defendant
understood
that
it
had
an
illegal
objective,
and
that
every
defendant
willingly
agreed
to
participate
in
the
conspiracy
with
the
aim
--
aim
of
advancing
that
illegal
objective.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
that
every
defendant
willingly
joined
the
conspiracy,
yes,
with
the
understanding
that
they
were
advancing
some
illegal
objective,
the
objective
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
that's
a
high
evidentiary--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--no,
no,
no.
no.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
to
prove
liability
for
each
person,
you
have
to
prove
that
that
person--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--satisfied
all
these
things.
i'm
sorry--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--that's
what
i
meant,
yes,
yes.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
but
that
is
--
this
is
high
evidentiary
burden
that
the
government
has
to
bear
to
prove
that
each
defendant
took
some
affirmative
action
to
get
into
the
conspiracy.
and
once
the
--
once
the
government
proves
that
a
defendant
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy,
then
it's
on
the
defendant
to
prove
--
to
take
some
affirmative
action
to
get
himself
out
of
the
conspiracy,
and
it
only
makes
sense
to
require
him
to
prove
that
he
took
that
act
instead
of
requiring
the
government
to
prove
negative
that
he
didn't
take
that
act
in
every
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
i
mean,
it
would
not
have
made
a
difference
in
this
case
for
the
reasons
you
suggest.
we
had
good
evidence
that
he
had
active
participation
within
the
limitations
period.
it
can
make
a
difference
in
some
other
cases.
you
know,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
most
criminal
conspiracies
that
are
charged
in
the
federal
system
involve
activity
that
was
more
recent
than
some
of
the
activity
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
but
it
certainly
can
come
up,
and,
you
know,
if
we
didn't
have
the
type
of
evidence
that
we
did
about
this
particular
defendant's
behavior
in
prison,
then
it
would
have
been
hard
to
rebut
his
assertion
of
withdrawal
caused
by
his
incarceration.
so
it
definitely
can
come
up.
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
oh,
it
certainly
could
have;
right.
it
could
have
decided
against
us
on
the
whole
thing,
but--
ms.
sarah
e.
harrington
--okay.
yeah.
i
didn't
mean
to
be
brazen
about
it.
we
think
we
had
good
evidence
that
the
petitioner
continued
in
the
conspiracy
in
this
case.
