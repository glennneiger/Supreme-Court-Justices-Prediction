justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
i'm
having
trouble
understanding
how
your
argument
would
work.
let's
say
that
the
defense
calls
a
witness
other
than
the
defendant
to
testify
to
a
conversation
in
which
the
defendant
allegedly
withdrew
from
the
conspiracy,
and
by
doing
that,
satisfies
its
burden
of
production.
now,
you
say
the
government
has
the
burden
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
not
only
that
this
conversation
didn't
occur,
but
also
that
the
defendant
never
withdrew
at
any
other
time
during
the
limitations
period.
isn't
that
where
your
argument
would
lead?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
but
how
can
they
prove
that
he
did
not
withdraw
at
any
other
time
during
this
conspiracy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
aren't
you
transforming
the
nature
of
withdrawal?
you
are
seeming
to
argue
that
the
government
has
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
active
participation
in
the
conspiracy
during
the
statute
of
limitations
period
rather
than
the
affirmative
withdrawal
from
the
conspiracy.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
ms.
harrington,
would
you
agree
that
as
this
argument
is
developing,
what
really
is
at
issue
has
less
to
do
with
the
statute
of
limitations
than
the
nature
of
conspiracy?
and
one
view
is
petitioners',
and
it's
embodied
in
some
of
the
questions
that
has
been
--
that
have
been
asked,
and
it's
this:
that
the
crime
is
continuing
to
participate
as
a
member
of
a
conspiracy.
and
the
other
view
is
that
a
conspiracy
is
a
dangerous
thing.
it's
like
rounding
up
a
--
a
pack
of
lions
or
wolves,
or
setting
loose
some
thing
that
continues
to
be
a
danger,
and
if
you
do
that
thing,
by
joining
it
you
are
liable
criminally
for
everything
that
happens
after
that,
even
if
at
a
certain
point
you
walk
away,
and
you
do
nothing.
now
if
--
if
he's
right,
that
it
is
active
membership,
then
there
may
be
a
problem
for
you
here.
but
if
the
other
view
is
correct,
that
you
are
liable
for
setting
this
thing
in
motion,
whether
or
not
you
continue
to
do
anything
active
in
support
of
it
during
the
limitations
period,
then
you
are
correct.
now
which
is
the
--
which
is
the
established
view
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
think
the
crux
of
your
argument
is
that
the
government
is
going
to
have
to
prove,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
active
participation
in
the
conspiracy
during
the
statute
of
limitations
period,
because
it
is
impossible
for
the
prosecution
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
on
no
day
during
a
five-year
period
did
the
defendant
withdraw
from
the
conspiracy.
it
simply
can't
be
done.
this
person
was
under
24-hour
video
surveillance
for
the
whole
five-year
period.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
say
what?
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
prove--
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
--the
opposite
of
what
they
have
to
prove?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
i
thought
you
argue
that
every
day
that
there
is
--
that
something
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
the
prosecution
hasn't
provided
sufficient
evidence?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
couldn't
you
argue
they
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
defendant
did
not
withdraw
during
this
five-year
period?
they
have
the
burden
of
proving
that.
and
did
you
hear
any
evidence
from
them
that
--
did
you
hear
evidence
disproving
that
--
that
he
didn't
withdraw
during
that
period?
there
is
no
evidence
on
that.
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
you
can
make
that
argument?
