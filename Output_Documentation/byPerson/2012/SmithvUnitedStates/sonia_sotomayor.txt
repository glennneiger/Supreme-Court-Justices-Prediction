isn't
that
like
an
amnesty?
isn't
that
how
you
described
it
in
your
brief?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two
in
your
mind
that
makes
it
an
element
of
the
crime
or
a
negation
of
some
element
of
the
crime?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
you
are
a
member,
you
are
liable
for
all
the
foreseeable
acts
of
your
coconspirators,
whether
or
not
you
knew
they
were
going
to
happen,
so
long
as
they
were
foreseeable?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
you
can
be
liable
for
as
long
as
you
stay
until
you
prove
you
withdrew.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
that
extinguishes
your
liability
for
the
continuing
conspiracy.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
the
why
is,
once
you've
joined,
you
are
trying
to
extinguish
liability.
why
would
the
government
have
to
prove
that
you're
entitled
to
amnesty
or
not
entitled
to
amnesty?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
actually
thought
your
stronger
argument
in
your
brief
was
in
trying
to
explain
why
it
negated
an
element.
i
think
what
you
said
in
your
brief,
and
you
haven't
made
it
here
yet,
as
clearly,
was
that
if
he
wasn't
willingly
participating
during
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
he
hadn't
committed
the
actual
crime.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
counsel,
in
a
normal
case
where
it's
a
robbery
or
burglary,
whatever,
you
charge
the
crime
happened
in
x
date,
and
the
defendant
raises
an
affirmative
defense
that
it's
not
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
who
bears
the
burden
of
proving
it
does,
in
that
situation?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
all
right.
so,
if
you
bear
the
burden
in
the
normal
statute
of
limitations
case,
the
issue,
i
think,
in
my
mind,
becomes,
do
you
continue
to
bear
that
burden
in
a
conspiracy
crime?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
--
and
you
still
have
to
prove
--
you're
saying
that
the
elements
of
the
statute
of
limitation
there
are
that
there
was
an
agreement
to
commit
a
crime,
this
person
joined
it
at
any
time
during
the
conspiracy,
and
the
conspiracy
continues.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
was
part
of
that
conspiracy
or
joined
that
conspiracy
during
the
statute
of
limitations;
that's
your
point.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
think
his
intuitive
argument
is,
i
can't
be
responsible
for
a
crime
i
wasn't
a
part
of
during
the
limitations
period.
that
really
is
the
essence
of
his
argument,
and
if
it's
your
job
to
prove
that
he
committed
the
--
a
robbery
during
the
limitations
period,
that
it's
your
job
to
prove
that
he
committed
the
conspiracy
during
--
that
he
was
part
--
that
the
conspiracy
--
that
he
was
part
of
the
conspiracy
during
the
limitations
period--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--i
think
that
that's
the
simplicity
of
his
argument.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
simplify
your
response
to
me.
[laughter]
justice
sonia
sotomayor
that's
not
a
simple
response.
[laughter]
you
are
already
way
too
fast.
