justice
elena
kagan
--so,
how
do
we
tell
that,
ms.
harrington?
because
it
seems
to
me
the
crux
of
the
difference
between
you
and
your
friend
is
that
you
say
the
element
is
membership
in
the
conspiracy
at
some
point,
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
within
the
limitations
period.
and
he
says
the
element
is
membership
in
a
conspiracy
in
the
limitations
period.
and
if
he's
right,
a
set
of
things
follow
from
that;
and
if
you
are
right,
another
set
of
things
follow.
so
how
do
we
determine
that
the
--
you
know,
that
the
statute
of
limitations,
that
the
timing
question
is
not
baked
into
the
elements
question?
that
it's
just
membership
sometime
as
opposed
to
membership
at
a
particular
time?
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
make
sure
i
understand
one
part
of
your
argument,
ms.
harrington.
the
conclusion
that
timing
--
the
timing
is
not
an
element.
now,
take
justice
sotomayor's
example
of
something
which
is
not
a
conspiracy
at
all,
let's
say
somebody
commits
a
robbery
and
you
have
to
show
that
the
person
has
committed
a
robbery
and
that
the
person
brings
up
the
question
of
timing.
you
also
have
the
burden
of
--
of
persuasion
on
that.
but
would
the
timing
be
an
element
in
that
case
or
not?
justice
elena
kagan
and
so
you
are
essentially
saying
that
this
case
should
be
treated
just
as
every
other
case.
you
happen
to
have
the
burden
of
persuasion
if
somebody
says
the
statute
of
limitations
has
been
violated,
but
the
question
of
when
conduct
occurred
is
never
an
element.
justice
elena
kagan
why
is
it
then
--
i
mean,
why
would
grunewald
be
right,
that
you
do
have
the
burden
if
in
fact
this
isn't
an
element?
justice
elena
kagan
well,
that's
because
they
thought
that
you
had
the
burden.
and
it
--
it
does
strike
me
that
if
you
are
right
that
this
is
an
element
--
membership
in
the
conspiracy
at
a
particular
time
--
and
the
government
has
the
burden,
this
idea
that
the
government
could,
you
know,
just
sort
of
just
say,
"well,
we
don't
have
any
evidence,
but
we
think
you
should
presume
that
we're
right.
"
i
mean,
that's
--
the
government
couldn't
do
that
if
you
are
right.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
if
you
make
an
assertion
and
they
don't
really
respond
to
the
assertion
and
--
you
win.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
kramer,
if
they
really
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
is
membership
in
the
conspiracy
during
the
limitations
period,
they
couldn't
just
come
in
and
say,
"well,
there's
membership
in
the
conspiracy
before
the
limitations
period,
and,
you
know,
you
should
assume
that
it
continued.
"
i
mean
that's
not
a
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
kind
of
proof,
is
it?
