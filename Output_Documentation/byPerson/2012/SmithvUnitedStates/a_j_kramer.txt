mr.
a.
j.
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
from
the
first
congress
in
1790,
congress
has
made
the
decision
that
all
federal
statutes
which
are,
of
course,
creatures
that
are
created
by
congress
in
statutes,
should
be
subject
to
a
statute
of
limitations;
in
this
particular
case,
5
years.
when
it
comes
to
conspiracy
cases,
as
this
court
said
in
hyde,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
treated
a
little
differently,
because
conspiracy
statutes
are
--
excuse
me,
conspiracy
crimes
--
are
continuing
offenses.
so
the
court
said
the
way
we
determine
--
one
way
to
determine
whether
a
particular
defendant's
involvement
in
a
conspiracy
has
ended
--
in
other
words,
his
membership
has
ended
--
is
by
the
doctrine
of
withdrawal.
it's
the
statute
of
limitations
that
is
the
defense
in
the
case.
it's
the
doctrine
of
withdrawal
that
triggers
--
that
is
the
triggering
event
for
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
sets
the
date
for
when
the
statute
of
limitations
starts
to
run.
withdrawal
in
and
of
itself
is
not
a
defense.
it's
the
statute
of
limitations
that's
the
defense.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
no.
this
court
has
called
it
a
defense
in
the
cook
case,
in
the
oppenheimer
case--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--it
does
have
to
be
raised
initially--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--well,
i
don't
--
it
is
not
an
element,
i
agree
with
that;
but
it
is
--
i
would
say
that
it's
engrafted
onto
every
federal
criminal
statute
by
statute.
this
is
not
the
common
law,
but
by
congress's
decision.
i
would
also
say
that
even
though
it's
not
an
element
of
defense
--
of
the
offense,
in
winship,
this
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
government
must
prove
every
fact
necessary
to
prove
a
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it's
a
fact
necessary--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--i
think
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
obviously,
the
burden
of
proof
is
different
in
criminal
cases
as
the
court
said
in
mullaney
v.
wilbur.
it
has
been
suggested
that
because
of
the
difficulties
in
negating
an
argument
that
a
homicide
was
committed
in
the
heat
of
passion,
the
burden
of
proof
should
rest
on
the
defendant.
and
they
said
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
many
controverted
facts,
but
this
is
the
traditional
burden
which
our
criminal
justice
system
applies.
i
also
thin
k
that
the
court
has
distinguished
on
some
grounds
and
is
the
civil
statute
of
limitations
from
the
criminal
statute.
in
fact,
in
the
number
of
cases,
this
court
has
talked
about
the
criminal
statute
of
limitations.
it
has
never
referred
to
it
as
an
affirmative
defense.
it
has
said
it's
a
defense,
but
it
has
never
said
that
the
defendant
is
required
to
prove
it.
in
fact,
the
quick
case
said
it's
part
of
the
merits
of
the
case;
although
it
doesn't
have
to
be
pleaded
in
the
indictment,
and
the
--
that
it
has
to
be
--
the
government
has
to
present
evidence
of
it
and
proof
of
it.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
we
do
accept
that
there
is
a
burden
of
production
as
with
several
other
things
that
are
not
affirmative
defenses
like
entrapment
or
alibi,
also
have
a
burden
of
production
before
the
government
has
to
prove
the
elements
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so,
it's
not--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--it's
--
it's
not
dissimilar
to
those
in
that
respect,
and
it
does
go
to
negate
an
element
of
the
crime.
in
the
conspiracy
statute,
the
membership
in
the
conspiracy
is
an
element
of
the
crime.
withdrawal
negates
that
element
of
the
crime.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
that's
true.
what
it
does
is
extinguish
liability
for
that
offense
past
that
time
if
the
statute
of
limitations
has
--
if
withdrawal
occurs
before
the
statute
of
limitations,
someone
can
no
longer,
as
the
statute
says,
"be
prosecuted,
tried
or
punished.
"
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
there
are
some
cases
that
call
it
an
amnesty,
some
cases
call
it
an
extinguishment
of
liability.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
in
a
conspiracy
there
is
the
conspiracy
that
--
the
government
has
to
prove
obviously
the
conspiracy
itself,
which
is
an
agreement
between
--
it
can
be
anyone.
and
then
they
have
to
prove
the
defendant's
membership
in
that
conspiracy.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
yes,
under
pinkerton,
yes.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
until--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--i
would
say
until
you
produce
evidence
that
you
withdrew,
yes.
and
then
the
government
has
to
prove
that
you
were
still
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
within
the
statutory
limitations
period.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
this
court
has
never
said
in
hyde--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--i
think,
justice
sotomayor,
that
it's
really
no
different
than
if
the
government
has
to
prove
you
guilty
of
a
crime
in
the
first
place.
they
have
to
prove
that
you
committed
the
offense.
the
statute
of
limitations
which
is,
as
i
said,
engrafted
on
every
federal
criminal
statute,
almost
every
statute--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--yes.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
he
would
be
treated
for
the
withdrawal
purpose.
if
he
withdrew,
he
would
also
not
be
liable
under
pinkerton.
there
is
a
membership
element
component
of
pinkerton
as
well,
for
pinkerton
liability.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
well,
i
think
actually
it's
just
the
opposite.
if
--
under
grunewald,
the
government
--
if
the
defense
--
if
the
claim
of
termination
is
raised,
the
government
has
to
prove
that
the
conspiracy
continued
into
the
limitations
period
and
that
there
was
an
overt
act,
that
was
an
overt
act.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
well,
actually
in
this
case
there
was
different
statutes
of
--
i
believe
there
were
three
different
statute
of
limitations
that
the
district
court
instructed
the
jury
about
because
there
were
superseding
indictments
and
people
were
indicted
at
different
times.
so
there
were
already,
in
this
case,
different
statute
of
limitations.
but
if
one
of
the
reasons
for
withdrawal
is
to
encourage
people
to
get
out
of
the
agreement,
justice
kennedy,
then,
and
try
to
thwart
the
agreement,
then
people
may
have
--
may
come
in
and
leave
at
different
times
during
a
conspiracy.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
i
do,
and
i
think
that
an
argument
can
be
made
if
the
intent
--
if
one
of
the
elements
of
that
offense
is
to
deprive
the
owner
permanently
of
the
property
and
he
did
not
have
that
intent,
the
government
would
have
to
prove
what
it
would
have
to
prove
originally,
which
is
that
he
intended
to
deprive
the--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--that
the
burden
of
persuasion
remains
on
the
defendant?
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
yes.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
well,
i
guess--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--self
defense
and
duress,
as
the
court
said
in
dixon
dealing
with
duress,
because
it
did
not
negate
the
elements
of
the
offense.
it
was
an
affirmative
defense
that
excused--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--if
it
doesn't
negate
the
elements
of
the
crime,
i
would
say
then
this
court
has
classified
it
as
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
well,
i
don't
think,
first
of
all--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--that
the
government
has
shown
--
well,
first
of
all,
they
--
they
have
to
prove
nothing
more
than
what
they
would
have
to
prove
originally,
that
the
defendant
was
joined
--
knowingly
and
willfully
joined
the
conspiracy.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
no,
they
would
not
have
to
prove
that
twice.
they
could
just
rest
on
what
they
had
done
originally.
the
burden
of
production
on
the
withdrawal,
the
government
could
just
say
to
the
jury
that
that's
nonsense,
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
here.
we've
proved
that
he
was
a
member.
there
is
a
permissive
inference
that
he
is
still
a
member
within
the
limitations
period.
they
would
not
have
to
prove
it
twice.
they
could
rest
on
what
they
had
done
originally.
it's
very
simple
for
them,
however,
to
rebut
this
evidence.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
it's
actually,
i
think,
quite
a
high
burden
of
production.
you
would
--
the
defendant,
in
most
cases
i
would
think
the
defendant
himself
would
have
to
testify,
which,
of
course,
subjects
him
to
extensive
cross-examination
on
everything.
he
can,
of
course,
cannot
call
his
co-conspirators
as
witnesses.
he
might
be
able
to
present
third-party
evidence
which
again
would
be
subject
to
cross-examination.
but
he
has
to
show
that
he
took
some
--
produce
evidence
that
he
took
some
affirmative
act
to
disavow--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--no,
i
disagree
with
that.
i
think
in
every
case
it
would
actually
be
fairly
simple
for
them.
if
the
defendant
can't
call
that
person
to
support
his
defense,
the
government
could
just
say,
well,
you
didn't
hear
any
testimony
from
that
person
supporting
the
defense.
that's
enough
right
there
to
meet
our
burden.
the
government,
as
in
this
case,
had
extensive
cooperating
witnesses,
had
wiretaps,
had
documentary
evidence--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--the
defendant
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
defendant
has
to
--
and,
of
course,
it
could
vary
by
state.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
the
states
may
put
different
burdens.
in
the
federal
system--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--the
defendant
has
the
burden
by
a
preponderance
to
prove
the
duress
defense
or
the
self-defense
defense.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
it's
not
though
in
the
sense
that
the
only
thing
that
connects
an
individual
defendant
to
a
conspiracy
is
that
defendant's
membership,
knowing
and
willful
participation
in
the
conspiracy.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
i
actually
think
it
makes
it
stronger
in
the
sense
that
congress
has
made
this
choice
to
require
that
every
crime
be
proved
to
have
been
committed
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
that
was
the--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--that
was
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
yes.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
the
court
said
in
dixon
--
it
might,
to
my
thinking,
but
the
court
said
in
dixon
that
it
did
not
negate
any
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
that
she
had
to
do
the
acts
knowingly
and
willfully
in
dixon
and
that
it
did
not
negate
those
elements.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
because
the
only
way
a
defendant
can
prove
--
the
way
a
defendant
shows
that
he
withdrew
is
to
produce
evidence
of
withdrawal.
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
he
is
a
member
--
necessarily
negates
the
element
of
membership
in
the
conspiracy.
if
he
withdrew,
he
cannot,
at
the
same
time,
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
no,
i
don't
think
they
have
to
disprove
the
conversation.
all
they
have
to
prove
is
what
they
had
to
prove
originally,
which
is
that
the
defendant
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
within
the
limitations
period,
by
any
kind
of
evidence.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
as
in
this
case
they
had
a
number--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--as
in
this
case
they
had
a
number
of
cooperating
witnesses
who
testified
about
mr.
smith's
actions.
they
could
ask
them,
did
the
conspiracy
--
did
mr.
smith
continue
to
participate,
was
he
involved,
did
he
withdraw,
any--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--no.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
active
participation
if
that
means
an
overt
act.
it
can
just
be
--
the
government
could
simply
rest
upon
the
inference
from
hyde
that
the
defendant
had
been
a
member
outside
the
limitations
period
and
their
continued
participation
is
inferred.
that
is
overcome
when
the
defendant
produces
evidence
of
withdrawal.
so--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--in
this
particular
case
it
was
the
--
well,
it
was
the
jury
that
actually
called
the
issue
to
the
attention
of
everybody
in
the
first
place
by
sending
out
a
note
saying
that
if
we
--
the
conspiracy
continued
but
we
think
a
defendant
left,
must
we
find
him
not
guilty?
there
was
a
number
of
pieces
of
evidence
primarily
that
he
was
incarcerated
for
over
six
years
before
the
indictment--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--no,
there
are
some
circuit
cases
that
say
that
alone
may
be
enough,
but
there
was
more
in
this
case.
in
this
particular
case
one
witness
said
he
recalled
--
he
did
not
recall
any
contacts
between
kevin
gray,
who
was
the
ringleader,
after
the
arrest.
another
said
that
mr.
smith
was
mad
at
mr.
gray
for
not
sending
any
money.
they
weren't
communicating
with
him.
another
witness
--
there
was
testimony
from
another
witness
that
mr.
smith
refused
to
comply
with
an
order
that
mr.
gray
sent
to
him.
so
there
were--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--whatever
that
may
be,
it's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
in
the
sense
that
the
government
is
actually
the
one
who
requested
that
the
district
court
give
the
withdrawal
instruction
after
the
jury's
note.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
i
think
that
whether
this
qualified
as
affirmative
acts
or
not
is,
in
a
sense,
irrelevant
to
the
question
before
the
court,
because
after
the
jury's
note
came
out,
the
government
itself
requested
the
withdrawal
instruction.
and
the
government
not
only
requested
the
withdrawal
instructions
but
said,
we
have
no
objection
to
placing
the
burden
on
us
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
if
that's
what
the
defense
wants.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
the
government
can
just
say
--
they
can
rest
on
the
fact
that
the
proof
outside
the
membership
period,
and
rest
on
the
inference
from
hyde
that
his
membership
continued.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
i
think
--
i
think
they
can
by
just
saying
to
--
well,
i
don't
think
they
have
a
burden
to
prove
the
absence
of
withdrawal.
they
have
the
burden
to
prove
membership
within
the
limitations
period.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
within
the
limitations,
his
membership
within
the
period.
so
they
can
just
say
to
the
jury,
look,
this
evidence
of
withdrawal
is
nonsense.
you've
heard
the
testimony.
we
have
cross-examined
him.
it
makes
no
sense.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
i
think
it's
up
to
the
jury
whether
to
believe
that
evidence
or
not.
and
i
don't
think
the
government
has
to
prove--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--the
evidence
that
was
produced
by
the
defendant
that
he
actually
told
somebody
he--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
the
defendant
had
testified
to
that
effect
that
he
--
if
there
is
no
evidence,
there
is
nothing
for
the
jury.
there
is
no
--
if
there's
--
the
defendant
has
not
produced
any
evidence
of
withdrawal,
then
there
is
nothing--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--absolutely.
and
it
happens
all
the
time
in
trials,
that
the
government
relies
upon
the
fact
of
a
witness's
unreliability
and
what
happened
on
cross
to
say
that
they
proved
their
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
don't
have
to
prove
anything
they
didn't
have
to
prove
originally
in
this
case.
in
fact,
it
may
be
easier
because
it's
within
the
limitations
period.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
yes.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
i--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--i
mean,
an
alibi
or
entrapment
negate
elements
are
not
affirmative
defenses.
if
an
alibi,
the
defense
is
what
--
and
what
could
happen
in
any
case--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--i
may
have
given
the
wrong
impression.
i
don't
classify
the
statute
of
limitations
as
--
as
an
affirmative
defense,
nor
has
this
court
ever
done
it.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
it's
not
--
well,
it's
not
an
element.
but
in
grunewald
this
court
said--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--i
think
in
ledbetter
this
court
said
that
although
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
date
in
the
indictment,
the
government
--
it's
sufficient
if
the
government
proves
a
date
before
the
indictment
within
the
limitations
period,
this
court
specifically
referred
to
in
ledbetter,
which
is
at
page
21
of
our
brief.
so
i
don't
--
i
may
have
given
a
wrong
impression.
this
is
not
an
affirmative
defense.
an
affirmative
defense
does
not--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--well,
i'm
halfway
there.
[laughter]
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
that
is
--
that
is
the
heart
of
our
argument,
that
it
negates
the
element
of
membership
within
the
statutory
period
which
is
what
the
government
has
to
prove.
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
did
not
make
that
clear.
but
the
element
that's
at
issue
that
the
statute
of
limitations
negates
is
membership
within
the
statute
--
membership
in
the
conspiracy,
knowing
and
willful
participation--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--well,
i
think
it
is
up
to
the
government
to
prove
it.
it
may
be
that
if
--
this
court
has
never
said
a
defendant
waives
it
by
not
raising
it.
but
i
think
the
government
has
to
prove
it
in
every
case.
it
may
be
waived.
some
circuits
have
said
it's
waived.
this
court
has
not
said
so.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
thank
you.
i
would
just
like
to
start
with
one
quick
point.
my
friend
said
that
"the
government
would
never
rest
on
its
laurels.
"
but
that's
precisely
what
they
did
in
this
case.
it
was
12
days
into
jury
deliberation
when
they
said,
"go
ahead
and
instruct
the
jury
on
withdrawal.
"
so
they
rested
on
the
evidence
that
had
been
presented
in
the
trial.
so
that's
precisely
what
they
did.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
the
--
the
government
could
just
rest
on
whatever
they
had
presented
originally
and
tell
the
jury
that's
plenty
to
prove
beyond
--
to
meet
our
burden
of
proof.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
it
--
i
mean,
it
happens
all
the
time.
the
defendants
say,
“
i
didn't
do
it
”,
and
the
government
presents
their
evidence
and
say,
"that
defense
is
nonsense.
"
"we
presented
overwhelming
evidence.
"
in
fact,
in
this
case,
also
they
did
--
they
didn't
ask
in
the
instruction
because
they
thought
it
was
our
burden.
they
agreed
in
the
end
that
the
jury
should
be
instructed--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--all
they
have
to
prove,
justice
alito,
is
that
the
person
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
within
the
limitations
period.
that
could
be
done
by
the
inference
that
they
were
a
member
outside
the
limitations
period
and
say
that
there
was
just
insufficient
--
that
the--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--no.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
no.
that
they
--
insufficient
evidence
doesn't
create
a
reasonable
doubt
in
what
they
are
required
to
prove,
which
is
membership
within
the
limitations
period.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
it
is.
and
the
prosecution
stands
up
and
says,
"we
presented
plenty
of
evidence
that
--
that
there
is
no
reasonable
doubt
here
at
all.
"
and
that
happens
every
day,
needless
to
say,
that
people
are
convicted
by
that
argument
when--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--they
get
a
permissive
inference.
and
there
are
many
cases
when
i
think
that
would
be
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
a
jury.
absent
some
conflicting
evidence
presented
by
the
defendant,
more
than
just
a
proffer.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
of
course--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--yes.
or
did
we
prove
--
did
you
hear
any
evidence
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
mr.
smith
was
a
member
during
the--
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
--right.
mr.
a.
j.
kramer
i
mean,
and
that
happens
every
day,
i
think,
in
cases
where
the
prosecution
just
stands
up
and
says,
"you
heard
that
evidence.
"
"nobody
would
think
that
is
a
reasonable
doubt
that
someone
was
not
a
member.
"
thank
you
very
much.
