but
what
the
chief
justice
indicates,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
if
we
accept
your
view,
then
there
is
going
to
be
a
different
statute
of
limitations
for
each
member
of
the
conspiracy.
so
you
have
four
or
five
different
statute
of
limitations.
i
find
that
--
i
find
that
puzzling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
it
essential
to
your
argument
that
the
very
definition
of
a
conspiracy
is
a
crime
that
continues
over
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
suppose
a
conspiracy
is
defined
by
relation
to
its
criminal
objects,
not
to
its
membership.
if
there's
five
people
that
conspired
to
rob
a
bank
and
one
of
the
conspirators
has
said:
i'm
out
of
here,
i
withdraw
from
the
conspiracy,
metaphysically,
you
might
argue,
well,
it's
a
new
conspiracy
because
it's
a
new
group.
but
there
is
no
support
of
the
law
for
that,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it's
the
criminal
objects
that
define
the
conspiracy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
didn't
hear
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
just
--
i
was
curious.
in
1997,
the
petitioner
did
report
the
identity
of
another
cooperating
witness
to
gray.
you
don't
--
you
don't
rely
on
that
as
showing
that
he
was
indeed
part
of
the
conspiracy?
that's
just
irrelevant
to
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
was
--
it
was
kind
of
a
throwaway
line.
but
why
isn't
that
dispositive
for
you?
