justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
--
is
there
any
--
i'm
trying
to
find
an
analogous
instance
without
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
what
occurred
to
me
just
as
an
example
that
you
might
have
in
your
practice
found
a
different
one,
the
thomas
crown
affair.
he
robs
the
bank
or
the
art
museum,
but
he
has
an
intent
to
return
it
and
he
produces
evidence
that
he
had
an
intent
to
return.
now,
in
such
a
case,
once
he
produces
the
evidence,
does
the
government
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
didn't
have
the
intent
to
return,
or
does
he
--
is
there
any
instance
in
which
the
burden
of
persuasion
shifts?
do
you
see
what
i'm
driving
at?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
have
never
found
a
case
--
i
will
ask
the
government
this
--
in
the
substantive
criminal
law,
no
matter
what,
who
is
--
even
if
the
defendant
is
the
only
one
ever
likely
to
know
anything
about
it,
you've
never
found
a
case
where
once
the
burden
is
produced,
the
burden
of
persuasion
remains
on
the
defendant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
because
you
agree
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
production
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i
was
trying
to
think
of
some
instance
--
as
i
said,
i
would
be
repeating
myself
--
i
am
looking
for
any
instance
in
which,
leaving
the
statute
of
limitations
out,
the
burden
of
persuasion
shifts
to
the
defendant;
so
i'm
saying
did
you
ever
find
one?
the
thomas
crown
affair
or
some
other
instance
and
your
answer
is
no,
you
never
have
heard
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
have
you
heard
of
it?
so
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
not
--
this
does
not
negate
the
elements
of
the
defense
--
this
does
not
negate
the
elements
of
the
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
then
if
that's
so,
if
it's
an
affirmative
defense
and
if
sometimes
where
it
doesn't
negate
the
elements
of
the
crime
the
burden
of
persuasion
remains
on
the
defendant,
then
why
shouldn't
it
here?
because
he's
the
one
most
likely
to
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
do
you
prove
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
often
do.
i
just
want
to
go
back,
get
the
complete,
insofar
as
you
can
help
with
this.
all
right.
let's
take
duress
or
self-defense.
the
government
shows
all
the
elements
of
murder,
then
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
i
have
evidence
here
that
it
was
under
duress
or
evidence
that
it
was
self-defense.
then
to
prevail,
what's
the
standard
of
persuasion?
how
does
it
work?
is
it
then
that
--
is
it
that
the
defendant
must
show
more
likely
than
not,
or
is
it
the
defend
--
that
i
was
defending
myself?
or
is
it
that
the
government
--
how
does
it
work?
what's
the
rule?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
of
course.
of
course.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
then
their
point
is,
well,
this
is
awfully
similar.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
fact
that
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
makes
your
case
weaker,
not
stronger,
because
--
because
the
statute
of
limitations
is
most
directly
connected
to
the
elements
of
the
offense
than
is
self-defense
or
duress.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
true,
but
his
point,
basic
point,
and
he
has
responded
to
the
points
i've
made,
is
that,
of
course
if
there
is
a
five-year
statute
on
robbery,
it
doesn't
help
the
government
that
he
create
--
he
committed
a
robbery
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
he's
saying
what
you
charged
in
the
indictment
is
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
conspiracy
that
existed
between
1995
and
2005.
that's
the
crime
that
concerns
us,
roughly.
and
he
is
saying
to
prove
your
case,
you
have
to
show
as
an
element
that
he
was
a
member.
now,
you
did
present
some
evidence
that
he
was
a
member.
and
he
wants
to
present
some
evidence
and
has
that
he
wasn't
a
member.
and
he
wasn't
a
member
if
he
withdrew.
and
therefore,
once
he
presents
enough
to
get
--
make
that
an
issue,
you
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
was
a
member.
so
you
have
to
show
he
didn't
withdraw.
now,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
by
coincidence
it
does,
but
a
statute
of
limitations
issue
would
be
that
you
all
agreed
that
he
withdrew,
but
the
question
is
did
it
happen
in
1993
or
1997.
that's
a
statute
of
limitations
issue,
but
this
isn't.
this
is
a
question
of
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
during
the
time
period
that
you
charged
in
the
indictment.
that's
his
point.
so
what
is
the
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you
can
charge
me
or
anybody
in
the
audience
or
anybody
here
with
what?
not
charging
them?
you
are
saying
there
was
a
conspiracy,
doesn't
he
have
to
be
shown
to
be
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
in
order
for
you
to
get
a
conviction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
an
element
of
the
crime?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
more
relevance,
is
there,
to
the
fact
that
there
happened
to
be
a
pre-1995
conspiracy,
except
as
a
matter
of
proof,
i
shouldn't
say
relevance,
that
he
happened
to
rob
a
bank
before
1995?
i
mean,
in
each
instance
there
was
criminal
activity
before
1995.
now,
you
can
use
that
in
order
to
prove
that
he
was
a
member
during
'95
to
2000.
that
i
see.
but
he
similar
can
use
the
matter
of
withdrawal
to
prove
he
wasn't
a
member
during
1995
to
2000.
and,
therefore,
it
goes
to
show
whether
you
or
the
government
have
proved
an
element
of
the
offense,
namely,
that
he
was
a
member
between
'95
and
2000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
am
looking
at
it
as
a
puzzle
here,
because
i
think
you
could
look
at
it
either
way.
i
mean,
if
a
person
commits
a
burglary
and
the
indictment
charges
that,
and
he
says,
yes,
i
did,
i
did;
there
is
no
doubt
about
all
the
elements
being
satisfied,
but
it
happened
outside
the
limitation
period.
that's
in
the
statute
of
limitations
area.
but
where
you
charge
the
conspiracy
taking
place
within
a
period
of
time,
as
i
would
think
you
usually
would
--
i
would
think
the
--
those
words
on
the
paper
almost
always
have
a
date
in
them
--
then
you
could
look
at
it
as
a
question
of
membership
in
that
conspiracy,
the
one
that's
charged,
in
which
case
it's
a
question
of
the
elements.
and
then
if
you're
in
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
the
time
he
withdrew
was
inside
or
outside
the
period,
that
becomes
a
limitations
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i'm
--
i'm
sort
of
--
i'm
torn
here.
i
actually
can
see
it
either
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
that
isn't
true.
you
have
to
prove
membership.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
it
happens
in
this
instance
that
you
bring
in
a
prima
facie
case.
i'd
be
repeating
myself.
and
that
he
says
withdrawal,
and
withdrawal
is
designed
to
negate
membership.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
the
withdrawal
prior
to
the
time
charged
negates
membership
in
the
conspiracy
that
you
have
charged,
because
there
was
no
membership
during
that
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
suspect
i
agree.
if
--
it's
awfully
tough
to
turn
this
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
particular
dates
in
the
indictment,
but
the
--
the
thing
that
motivates
me
--
i
mean,
i
can
see
it's
like
a
rabbit-duck.
you
know,
is
it
a
rabbit
or
is
it
a
duck?
and
--
and
the
--
the
--
the
thing
that
is
so
rare
in
the
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yet
it's
so
rare
that
the
government
doesn't
have
the
burden
of
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
it
suggests
when
in
doubt,
say
reasonable
doubt.
but
--
so
what
do
you
want?
i
mean,
we've
thought
of
duress.
we've
thought
of
self-defense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
anything
else?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nothing
to
do
with
statute
of
limitations.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
--
i'm
sorry,
the
thomas
crown
affair
again,
all
the
evidence
shows
he
took
$10,000
from
the
bank.
he
testifies
and
says,
"oh,
i
was
going
to
give
it
back.
"
okay?
the
prosecution
puts
on
nothing.
the
jury
says,
“
are
you
kidding
”?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
