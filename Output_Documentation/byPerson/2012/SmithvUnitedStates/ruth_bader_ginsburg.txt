justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
prove
the
crime
without
a
reasonable
--
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
if
you
never
raised
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
statutes
of
limitations
exist
for
civil
claims
as
well
as
criminal
claims.
and
in
--
on
the
civil
side,
the
statute
of
limitations
is
an
affirmative
defense,
and
it's
up
to
the
plaintiff
to
plead
and
prove
--
both
plead
and
prove
it,
both
the
burden
of
production
and
persuasion.
why
should
it
be
different
on
the
criminal
side?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
--
i
think
you
--
you
recognized
that
--
that
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
production,
not
the
government,
the
burden
--
burden
of
coming
forward
with
this
defense
and
producing
some
evidence
of
the
withdrawal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
--
only
for
the
later
period.
it
doesn't
negate
that
this
person
was
once
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
the
government
has
the
burden
to
show
membership,
and
it
did.
so,
it's
not
--
it
doesn't
reach
back
to
negate
that
there
was
membership
at
some
time,
it
just
says:
after
withdrawal
we
no
longer
prosecute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
have
the
government
prove
that
twice.
they
prove
his
membership
in
the
conspiracy,
and
then
you
say
once
he
alleges
that
he
withdrew,
they
have
to
prove
it
again.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
would
you
--
what
would
you
have
to
produce
to
get
over
your
threshold
of
satisfying
the
burden
of
production?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
evidence
of
withdrawal
did
you
produce
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
agree
--
you
agree
that
that
would
not
have
necessarily
meant
withdrawal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
recognize
--
you
recognize,
as
i
think
justice
alito's
question
doesn't,
that
there
is
--
there
is
a
withdrawal
defense
and
the
question
is
how
do
you
allocate
the
proof
burden.
so
your
case
accepts
that
there
is
a
withdrawal
defense.
indeed,
the
judge
gave
a
charge
to
the
jury.
so
the
contest,
as
i
understand
it,
the
difference
between
the
two
of
you
is
you
say,
defendant
can
say,
“
i
withdrew
”.
if
he
does
that,
he
has
to
prove
it.
and
the
defendant
is
saying,
"i
have
to
produce
enough
so
that
a
jury
could
find
i
withdrew,
but
you
have
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion.
"
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
this
--
the
burden
allocation,
is
this
a
more
hypothetical
academic
question?
i
mean,
you
pointed
out
that
you
had
ample
evidence
to
show
that
he
remained
a
member
of
the
conspiracy,
so
does
the
allocation
of
burden
of
persuasion
to
the
defendant
versus
proof
of
production
to
the
defendant,
persuasion
to
the
government,
does
it
really
make
much
difference?
does
it
have
much
practical
consequence?
