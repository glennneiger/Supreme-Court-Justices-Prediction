and
one
way
is
to
assess
the
validity
or
the
strength
of
the
infringement
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
my
concern,
is
your
test
is
the
same
for
a
very
weak
patent
as
a
very
strong
patent.
that
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
wouldn't
that
determination
itself
reflect
the
strength
or
weakness
of
the
patent
so
that
the
market
forces
take
that
into
account?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
18
--
the
18-month
rule
primarily?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
i
mean
180
days,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
--
would
it
help
if
you
were
--
were
thinking
about
rules
and
caps,
to
consider
not
what
the
branding
company
would
have
--
would
have
made,
but
what
the
generic
company
would
have
lost,
and
--
and
use
the
latter
as
the
limit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
--
you
have
to
make
an
extrapolation,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
generic
wins,
though,
its
--
everybody's
profits
are
lower.
and
you
can
gear
it
to
just
what
the
--
what
the
generic
would
have
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
--
what
do
we
look
at
to
verify
what
you
say?
is
that
--
is
that
all
in
the
briefs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
i
had
thought,
as
justice
kagan's
question
might
indicate,
that
the
180
days
is
crucial,
it
allows
you
to
go
to
the
doctors,
to
give
them
the
name
of
your
generic
equivalent,
et
cetera,
and
that
that's
a
big
advantage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
now,
you're
--
now,
you're
indicating
that
it
isn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
--
suppose
that
hypothetical
is
correct.
that's
was
my
concerns,
too.
what
the
brand
company
can
lose
is
much
greater
than
what
the
generic
can
make.
so
why
don't
you
just
put
a
cap
on
what
the
generic
can
make
and
then
we
won't
have
a
real
concern
with
the
restraint
of
trade,
or
we'll
have
a
lesser
concern.
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
justice
ginsburg's
question
and
it's
my
concern
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
it's
not
hypothetical
that
if
the
generic
wins
everybody
--
the
brand
companies
profits
are
going
to
go
way,
way
down
right
away
and
generic
profits
are
not
going
to
be
that
great.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
so
then
the
question
still
holds.
if
you
--
if
you
key
your
payment
to
what
the
brand
company
will
make,
it's
just
a
much
higher
figure,
and
a
greater
danger
of
unreasonable
restraint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
i
will
grant
you
that
point
that
the
180
days
is
not
that
big
a
difference,
and
that
there
are
many
generics
out
there.
but
isn't
that
true
in
every
industry?
you
said
at
the
outset:
oh,
well,
now
in
the
drug
industry
there
are
a
lot
of
people
ready
to
pounce
in.
isn't
that
true
in
any
industry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it's
correct
that
to
develop
a
new
drug
sometimes
you
need
not
just
scientists
and
attorneys,
you
need
investment
bankers.
and
you
then
need
marketers,
because
the
cost
of
these
drugs
can
be
hundreds
of
millions.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
the
development
cost
of
this
drug?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
can
be
a
billion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
anything
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
anything
in
the
record?
