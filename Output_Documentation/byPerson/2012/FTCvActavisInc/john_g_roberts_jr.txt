chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
case
12-416,
the
federal
trade
commission
v.
actavis.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
weinberger?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
certainly.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
thought
that
mr.
weinberger's
point
was
that
this
is
always
going
to
happen,
because
it's
very
easy
--
as
he
said,
you
put
a
sign
on
your
neck
saying,
generics
line
up
to
get
your
payment.
that
seems
quite
different
than
saying
there's
another
firm
out
there
in
the
abstract
that
--
that
might
want
to
enter
into
a
similar
market
sharing
arrangement.
this
is
a
very
different
system.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
breyer
has
our
opinion
this
morning,
case
12-416,
the
federal
trade
commission
versus
activist.
