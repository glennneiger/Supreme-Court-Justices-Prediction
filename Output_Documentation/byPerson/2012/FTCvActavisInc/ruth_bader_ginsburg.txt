mr.
stewart,
does
this
represent
a
change
in
the
government's
position?
i
got
the
idea
from
the
briefs
that
at
the
time
of
this
schering-plough
case,
that
was
also
before
the
eleventh
circuit,
that
the
government
was
not
taking
that
position
it's
now
taking.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
consideration
that
seems
to
be
driving
the
government?
that
is,
the
generic
is
getting
an
offer
that
they
would
never
get
on
the
street.
i
mean,
they
have
been
paid
much
more
than
they
would
get
if
they
won
the
patent
infringement
suit.
if
they
won
the
patent
infringement
suit
then
they
can
sell
their
generic
in
competition
with
the
brand,
but
under
this
agreement
they
get
more
than
they
would
get
by
winning
the
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
government
was
telling
us
that
that's
this
case,
that
the
--
what
the
generic
is
being
offered
in
the
way
of
sharing
the
monopoly
profits
is
more
than
it
could
ever
make
if
it
wanted
to
and
sold
its
drug.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
was
the
change
that
was
made?
