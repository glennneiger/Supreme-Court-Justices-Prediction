mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
a
general
matter,
a
payment
from
one
business
to
another
in
exchange
for
the
recipient's
agreement
not
to
compete
is
an
paradigmatic
antitrust
trust
violation.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
such
a
payment
should
be
treated
as
lawful
when
it
is
encompassed
within
the
settlement
of
a
patent
infringement
suit.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
reverse
payments
to
settle
hatch-waxman
suits
are
objectionable
for
the
same
reasons
that
payments
not
to
compete
are
generally
objectionable.
they
subvert
the
competitive
process
by
giving
generic
manufacturers
an
incentive
to
accept
a
share
of
their
rival's
monopoly
profits
as
a
substitute
for
actual
competition
in
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
there
are
really
two
differences
between
that
--
that
scenario
and
the
one
presented
here.
the
first
is
that
an
exclusive
license
is
expressly
authorized
by
the
patent
act,
in
section
261
of
title
35,
but
--
but
the
second
thing
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
second
thing
is
that
an
exclusive
license
doesn't
give
the
--
the
infringement
defendant
anything
that
it
couldn't
hope
to
achieve
by
prevailing
in
the
lawsuit.
that
is,
if
the
--
at
least
any
right
to
compete
that
it
wouldn't
get
by
prevailing
in
the
lawsuit.
if
the
infringement
defendant
won,
it
would
be
able
to
sell
wherever
it
wanted
to.
now,
there
may
be
some--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
point
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
point
here
is
that
the
money
is
being
given
as
a
substitute
for
earning
profits
in
a
competitive
marketplace.
that
is,
in
--
in
the
hatch-waxman
settlement
context,
by
definition,
we
have
a
disagreement
by
parties
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
the
infringement
and
--
and/or
invalidity
questions
as
to
the
patent
infringement
suit.
the
brand
name
is
saying
its
patent
is
valid
and
infringed.
the
generic
is
saying
either
that
the
patent
is
invalid
or
that
its
own
conduct
won't
be
infringing
or
both.
and
if
the
generic
wins,
it
will
be
able
to
enter
the
market
immediately.
if
the
brand
name
wins,
it
will
be
able
to
keep
the
generic
off
until
the
patent
expires.
and
so
in
that
circumstance,
a
logical
subject
of
compromise
would
be
to
agree
upon
an
entry
date
in
between
those
two
end
points,
just
as
the
parties
to
a
damages
action
would
be
expected
to
settle
the
case
by
the
defendant
agreeing
to
pay
a
portion
of
the
money
it
would
have
to
pay
if
it
lost.
that's
an
actual
subject
of
compromise
and
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
if
you
adopt
respondent's
conception
of
what
it
means
to
act
within
the
scope
of
the
patent.
and
let
me
explain.
when
the
respondents
say
that
the
restrictions
at
issue
here
are
within
the
scope
of
the
patent,
what
they
mean
is
that
the
goods
that
are
being
restricted
are
arguably
encompassed
by
the
patent
and
the
restriction
doesn't
extend
past
the
date
when
the
patent
expires.
that's
all
they
mean.
and
if
that
were
the
exclusive
test,
the
defendants
in
masonite,
in
new
wrinkle
inline
material,
they
would
all
have
been
off
the
hook,
because
all
of
those
cases
involved
restrictions
on
trade
in
patented
goods
during
the
period
that
the
patent
was
in
effect,
and
yet,
the
court
found
antitrust
liability
in
each
of
these.
now,
the
way
that
respondent
tries
to
explain
masonite,
for
example,
masonite
involved
a
resale
price
maintenance
agreement
in
which
the
patentholder
sold
goods
and
then
attempted
to
control
the
price
at
which
they
would
be
resold,
and
the
court
said
that
under
the
rule
of
patent
exhaustion,
the
patentholder
didn't
have
the
right
to
do
that
and
therefore
the
patent
laws
provided
no
shield
and
the
agreement
was
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
respondents
say,
well,
that's
consistent
with
their
theory
because
the
restriction
imposed
went
beyond
the
scope
of
the
patent
because
the
right
to
control
resale
is
not
one
of
the
rights
that
the
patent
act
confers.
but
if
that's
the
test
for
whether
a
restriction
is
within
the
scope
of
the
patent,
then
we
would
say
that
it's
not
met
here,
because
there's
nothing
in
the
patent
act
that
says
you
can
pay
your
competitor
not
to
engage
in
conduct
that
you
believe
to
be
infringing.
and
really
that's
the
thrust
of
their
position,
that
if
you
have
--
if
a
patentholder
has
a
non-sham
allegation
that
a
particular
mode
of
competition
would
be
an
infringement
of
its
patent,
the
patentholder
can
pay
the
competitor
not
to
engage
in
that
competition.
again,
we
are
not
talking
about
conduct
in
which
there
has
been
any
judicial
determination
that
infringement
has
occurred.
we
are
just
talking
about
cases
in
which
the
patentholder
has
a
non-sham
allegation
that
infringement
would
occur.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
ftc
has
consistently
taken
this
position.
the
department
of
justice,
up
until
2009,
we
didn't
endorse
the
scope
of
the
patent
test.
indeed,
in
our
invitation
brief
in
joblove
we
specifically
said
that
the
scope-of-the-patent
test
was
--
didn't
provide
for
enough
scrutiny
of
these
settlements.
but
what
we
advocated,
what
the
department
of
justice
advocated,
instead
was
a
test
that
would
focus
on
the
strength
and
scope
of
the
patent.
that
is,
the
likelihood
that
the
brand
name
would
ultimately
have
prevailed
if
the
suit
had
been
litigated
to
judgment.
and
in
2009
for
the
first
time
in
an
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
second
circuit,
we
took
essentially
the
position
that
we're
taking
here,
that
is
that
agreements
of
this
sort
should
be
treated
as
presumptively
unlawful
with
the
presumption
able
to
be
rebutted
in
various
ways.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would
say
that
that's
not
a
way,
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
the
test
is
whether
there
has
been
a
payment
that
would
tend
to
skew
the
parties'
choice
of
an
entry
date,
that
would
tend
to
provide
an
incentive
for
the
parties
to
--
for
the
generic
to
agree
to
an
entry
date
later
than
the
one
that
it
would
otherwise
insist
on.
now,
it
probably
is
the
case
that
our
test
would
have
greater
practical
import
in
cases
where
the
parties
perceive
the
patent
to
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
in
the
kind
of
settlement
that
we
would
regard
as
legitimate,
where
the
parties
simply
agree
to
a
compromise
date
of
generic
entry,
then
the
parties
would
certainly
take
into
account
their
own
assessment
of
what
would
likely
happen
at
the
end
of
the
suit.
and
so
if
the
parties
believe
that
the
brand
name
was
likely
to
prevail,
then
if
the
brand
name
agreed
to
early
generic
entry
at
all,
it
would
presumably
be
for
a
fairly
small
amount
of
time.
conversely,
if
the
parties
collectively
believe
that
the
generic
--
that
the
brand
name
had
a
weak
case
and
the
generic
was
likely
to
prevail,
then
they
would
negotiate
for
an
earlier
date.
and
the
problem
with
the
reverse
payment
is
that
it
gives
the
generic
an
incentive
to
accept
something
other
than
competition
as
a
means
of
earning
money.
i
mean,
to
take
another--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--these
suits
--
these
types
of
payments
appear
to
be
essentially
unknown
in
other
lawsuits
and
other
patent
infringement
cases.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
congress
has
tried
to
reduce
the
incentives
for
these
payments
to
be
made.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
a
couple
things
i
would
say.
first,
i
don't
think
we're
--
we're
not
asking
you
to
overturn
established
antitrust
laws.
to
take
along
analogy,
for
example,
if
watson
instead
of
developing
a
generic
equivalent
to
androgel,
had
developed
an
entirely
new
drug
that
it
believed
would
be
better
than
androgel
for
the
same
conditions
and
if
solvay
had
paid
watson
not
to
seek
fda
approval
and
not
to
seek
to
market
the
drug,
i
think
everyone
would
agree
that
that
was
a
per
se
antitrust
violation,
even
though
watson's
ultimate
ability
to
market
the
new
drug
would
depend
on
fda
approval
that
might
or
might
not
be
granted.
and
so
when
we
say
it's
unlawful
to
buy
off
uncertain
competition,
it's
unlawful
to
buy
out
competition
even
when
the
competition
might
have
been
prevented
by
other
means,
we
are
just
enforcing
standard
antitrust
principles.
to
focus
on
the
distinction
between
hatch-waxman
and
other
patent
litigation,
professor
hovenkamp's
conclusion
is
that
the
reason
that
you
don't
see
payments
like
this
in
the
normal
patent
infringement
suit
is
that
in
the
typical
market
if
a
patentholder
were
known
to
have
paid
a
large
sum
of
money
to
a
competitor
who
had
been
making
a
challenge
to
the
patent,
if
other
competitors
knew
that
that
had
happened,
then
they
would
perceive
that
to
be
a
sign
that
the
patent
was
weak
and
that
they
would
leap
in.
but
he
says
hatch-waxman
makes
it
more
difficult
for
that
to
be
done,
because
hatch-waxman
gives
unique
incentives
to
the
first
paragraph
4
filer.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
a
180-day
period
of
exclusivity.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes,
and
the
way
it
works
is
that
the
exclusivity
period
is
not
good
in
and
of
itself
for
consumers.
that
is,
during
the
period
when
one
generic
is
on
the
market
and
the
others
are
not
yet
allowed
to
compete,
you
have
essentially
duopoly
conditions,
the
price
of
the
drug
drops
but
only
by
a
little
bit.
congress
granted
the
180-day
exclusivity
period
because
it
wanted
generics
to
have
ample
incentives
to
challenge
patents
that
were
perceived
to
be
weak.
and
if
the
first
filer
is
able
essentially
to
be
bought
off,
is
able
to
set
settle
for
something
other
than
early
entry
into
the
marketplace,
then
other
potential
competitors
face
barriers
to
entry
that
they
--
similarly
situated
competitors
wouldn't
face
in
other
industries.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
--
the
court
has
recognized
such
a
thing
as
the
quick
look
approach,
but
i
think
even
though
the
case
didn't
use
the
term
“
quick
look
”,
i
don't
believe
it
did,
ncaa
v.
regents
of
university
of
oklahoma
is
probably
the
best
example,
where
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
that's
the
--
that's
the
one
i'm
most
familiar
with.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'll
need
to
look
back
and
see
what--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
would
leave
courts
without
guidance
as
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--without
guidance
as
to
what
factors
would
be
appropriate--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
certainly
our
proposed
approach
accounts
for
that.
it
provides
--
it
provides
really
two
different
forms
of
rebuttal.
first
our
approach
says,
this
is
on
its
face
an
agreement
not
to
compete,
the
generic
has
agreed
to
stay
out
of
the
market
for
a
defined
period
of
time,
and
the
payment
gives
rise
to
an
inference
that
the
agree
--
that
the
delay
that
the
generic
has
agreed
to
is
longer
than
the
period
that
would
otherwise
reflect
its
best
assessment
of
its
likelihood
of
--
of
success
in
the
lawsuit.
but
then
we
say,
there
are
basically
two
different
types
of
ways
in
which
the
presumption
could
be
rebutted.
first,
the
parties
can
show
that
the
payment
was
not
in
consideration
for
delay,
that
there
was
some
other
commensurate
value
transferred,
and
the
payment
--
and
that
arrangement
would
have
been
entered
into
even
without
the
larger
settlement.
and
then
second,
we're
at
least
accepting
the
possibility
that
brand
names
and
generics
could
come
in
and
say,
even
though
our
payment
was
for
delay,
even
though
we
can't
identify
anything
else
that
the
payment
could
have
been
consideration
for,
it's
still,
quote,
“
competitive
”
under--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--let
me
say
a
couple
of
things
about
the
administrative
nightmare.
the
first
is
that
to
the
extent
that
these
inquiries
are
difficult,
they're
difficult
only
by
--
because
the
brand
names
and
the
generics
have
made
them
difficult
by
tacking
on
additional
transactions
to
their
settlement
proposal.
and
to
take
an
analogy,
there
are
government
ethics
rules
that
say
that
--
what
are
called
prohibited
sources.
basically,
people
who
have
business
before
the
department
can't
give
me
gifts
as
a
government
employee.
now,
obviously,
it
would
be
absurd
to
have
a
rule
that
said
a
prohibited
source
couldn't
give
me
a
rolex
watch,
but
could
sell
me
a
rolex
watch
for
a
dollar.
and
so
the
ethics
rules
treat
as
a
gift
an
exchange
for
value
in
which
fair
market
value
is
not
paid.
and
everybody
understands
that
once
you
go
down
that
route,
occasionally,
you
will
have
hard
cases
in
which
people
could
legitimately
agree,
was
this
a
legitimate
arm's
length
exchange
or
was
it
a
concealed
gift?
but
the
prospect
of
those
difficult
cases
doesn't
mean
that
we
get
rid
of
a
gift
ban
altogether.
and
certainly,
federal
employees
couldn't
bring
the
--
the
ethics
office
to
its
knees
by
engaging
in
such
a
proliferation
of
these
side
deals
that
the
ethics
office
decided
it's
not
worth
it.
the
second
thing
is
that
respondent's
approach
would
apply
even
when
there
are
no
hard
questions.
respondents
would
say
that
even
if
the
agreement
provides
for
delayed
generic
entry
until
the
date
the
patent
expires,
and
even
if
the
only
other
term
of
the
agreement
is
the
brand
name
pays
the
generic
a
lot
of
money,
that
that
would
be
a
legitimate
agreement,
because
the
restriction
would
apply
to
arguably
patented
drugs
and
it
wouldn't
extend
beyond
the
date
of
patent
expiration.
i
guess
the
--
the
other
thing
i
would
say
about
the
way
in
which
these
payments
can
facilitate
settlement
really
shows
their
anticompetitive
potential.
that
is,
suppose
the
parties
were
negotiating
for
a
compromise
date
of
entry,
but
they
couldn't
agree;
the
--
the
brand
name
said
beginning
of
2017
is
the
earliest
we'll
let
you
in
and
the
generic
said
beginning
of
2015
is
the
latest
date
that
we
would
accept.
now,
the
respondents
use
the
term
“
bridge
the
gap
”,
but
there's
obviously
no
way
that
a
payment
from
the
brand
name
to
the
generic
could
enable
the
parties
to
agree
on
an
entry
date
between
2015
and
2017.
the
brand
name
is
never
going
to
say,
well,
i
would
insist
on
holding
out
until
2017,
but
if
i'm
going
to
pay
you
a
whole
lot
of
money,
then
i'll
let
you
earlier
and
accept
a
--
a
diminution
of
your
profits.
the
brand
name
is
going
to
say,
if
i
pay
you
money,
i'm
going
to
insist
on
deferring
entry
even
later
than
the
2017
date
that
would
otherwise
be
my
preferred
compromise.
so
the
natural
effect
of
these
payments
is
not
to
facilitate
a
--
a
bridging
the
gap
in
the
sense
of
a
picking
of
a
point
between
the
dates
that
the
parties
would
otherwise
insist
on.
it
is
going
--
it
is
very
likely
to
cause
the
parties
to
agree
to
an
entry
date
that's
even
later
than
the
one
the
brand
name
would
otherwise
find
acceptable.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
not
--
not
price
fixing,
but
it's
--
it's
an
agreement
not
to
compete.
that
is,
the
parties
are
not
agreeing
as
to
the
prices
they
will
charge.
the
generic
is
agreeing
to
stay
off
the
market
first.
but
that
would
be
treated
as
per
se--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--now,
if
you
wanted
to
tweak
the
theory
in
that
way
and
to
say
that
in
cases
where
there
is
not
just
a
payment
and
an
agreement
on
the
date
of
market
entry,
but
there
is
additional
consideration
exchanged
beside,
if
you
wanted
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
would
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
this
was
not
a
fair
exchange
for
value,
that
--
that's
not
something
we
would
agree
with,
but
that
would
be
a
fairly
minor
tweak
to
our
theory.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
rule
--
i
mean,
it's
bad
for
reasons
both
of
administrability
and
it's
bad
conceptually.
the
reason
it's
bad
for
reasons
of
administrability
is
that
--
at
least
i
take
what
you
are
proposing
to
be
that
the
antitrust
court
would
consider
all
the
factors
that
might
bear
on
the
assessment
of
the
agreement,
that
those
would
include
presumably
a
strength
of
the
patent
claim,
the
subjective--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
not
atypical
--
i
mean
--
and
the
court
did
this
in
ncaa,
for
example,
where
it
said
that
the
agreement
it
was
looking
at,
which
dealt
with
the
allocation
of
--
of
--
allocation
of
rights
to
televised
football
games
--
was
essentially
a
limitation
on
output,
and
the
court
said
those
are
presumptively
unlawful.
long
experience
in
the
market
has
shown
that
they
are
suspect.
the
court
didn't
say
there
was
long
experience
in
the
market
for
television
rights
to
football.
it
just
said
output
limitations
have
been
established
as
disfavored.
nevertheless,
because
competitive
sports
by
nature
require
a
degree
of
cooperation
between
the
people
who
compete
against
each
other
--
to
establish
the
rules
of
the
game
and
so
forth
--
we
will
look
to
see
whether
the
parties
have
identified
--
whether
the
defendants
have
identified
anything
about
their
specific
industry
that
would
justify
our
decision
not
to
apply
the
usual
presumption,
and
it
concluded
that
there
was
nothing
there.
and
we're
really
asking
the
court
to
take
the
same
approach
here.
we're
saying
payments
not
to
compete
are
generally
disfavored.
the
parties
can
--
when
you
have
a
hatch-waxman
settlement
in
which
money
is
passing
from
the
brand
name
to
the
generic,
it's
an
unusual
settlement
to
begin
with,
because
there's
no
way
that
the
suit
could
have
culminated
in
the
generic
receiving
a
money
judgment.
and
therefore,
we'll
--
we'll
look
upon
this
with
suspicion,
be
we'll
give
the
parties
adequate
opportunities
to
--
to
rebut.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you.
mr.
weinberger
argued
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
settlement
of
this
sort
has
anticompetitive
effects,
we
would
have
to
know
how
the
lawsuit
would
have
turned
out,
but
it's
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
principle
of
antitrust
law
that
particular
conduct
can
be
legal
or
illegal,
depending
on
the
deliberative
process
that
led
up
to
it.
and
to
put
that
in
concrete
terms,
if
a
business
charges
a
particular
price
for
a
particular
product,
because
it's
made
the
assessment
that
this
will
maximize
profits
in
a
competitive
environment,
that
decision
is
almost
immune
from
antitrust
scrutiny.
but
if
the
business
charges
the
same
price
for
the
same
product
in
the
same
market
because
it's
agreed
with
its
competitor
that
it
will
charge
that
price,
that's
a
per
se
antitrust
violation.
so
it's
not
at
all
anomalous
to
say
that
this
type
of
agreement
can
be
deemed
anticompetitive,
even
though
the
same
result,
namely,
exclusion
of
the
generic
from
the
market
might
have
been
able
to
be
obtained
by
other
means.
the
second
thing
is,
mr.
weinberger
said
there
are
instances
in
which
second
and
successive
filers
will
attempt
to
challenge
the
brand
name
even
after
the
first
filer
has
been
bought
off.
i
think
we
--
we
disagree
that
it's
as
easy
as
he
would
say
it
is,
but
we'll
concede
it
happens
occasionally.
but
the
fact
that
particular
anticompetitive
conduct
doesn't
always
work
doesn't
make
it
lawful.
it
could
often
happen
that
two
firms
were
thinking
about
entering
into
a
price-fixing
agreement,
for
instance,
but
thought
to
themselves,
if
we
do
that,
there's
a
third
competitor
in
the
market
who
will
be
able
to
undersell
us,
and
this
would
make
our
agreement
unprofitable.
and
it
might
happen
sometimes
that
two
firms
try
to
proceed
with
a
price-fixing
conspiracy,
but
they're
thwarted
because
of
the
unexpected
competition
from
a
third
firm.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
first,
there
certainly
is
no
evidence
suggesting
that
it
has
happened
often,
although
there
is
evidence
that
it
has
happened.
but
if
the
brand
name
perceived
on
a
systemic
basis
that
the
likely
result
of
paying
off
one
competitor
was
that
another
competitor
would
step
in
and
couldn't
be
bought
off
would
litigate
the
suit
to
judgment,
there
would
be
no
incentive
to
make
the
reverse
payment
in
the
first
place.
that
is,
in
making
the
reverse
payment,
what
the
--
the
brand
name
is
attempting
to
purchase
is
protection
from
the
possibility
that
it
will
have
its
patent
invalidated,
and
it
will
suffer
a
large
competitive
advantage.
if
a
brand
name
thinks
in
a
particular
instance
there
is
somebody
else
who's
going
to
expose
it
to
--
me
to
that
risk,
the
--
the
payment
wouldn't
be
expected
to
be
made.
so
at
least--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
for
the
reasons
that
--
that
your
question
suggested,
that
there
is
the
180-day
exclusivity
period
and
leaving
aside
the
cases
in
which
that
is
waived,
subsequent
manufacturers
would
realize
not
only
that
they
wouldn't
get
that
period
of
heightened
profits
themselves,
but
they
would
have
to
wait
in
line
for
others,
and
they
might
focus
their
attention
on
other
patents
that
were
perceived
to
be
weak
as
to
which
they
could
hope
to
--
to
get
the
180-day
exclusivity
contract.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
know
it
is
the
great
majority,
i
don't
have
a
percentage
figure.
and
the
reason,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
was
that
during
the
180-day
exclusivity
period,
you
have
only
two
competitors.
basically,
a
biopoly
arrangement.
and
my
understanding
is
that
the
generics
would
usually
charge
around
80
to
85
percent
of
the
brand
name's
price
during
that
period.
and
after
there
is
full
competition,
the
price
would
drop
to
a
fraction
of
that.
the
next
thing
i
would
say
is
that
our
system
encourages
settlement,
but
not
to
the
nth
degree.
and
so,
for
instance,
if
you
had
two
--
two
firms
fighting
over
a
million
dollars
and
each
firm
decided
internally,
600,000
is
the
least
i
will
accept.
if
they
stuck
to
their
guns,
the
case
couldn't
be
settled.
now,
if
the
public
could
be
made
to
kick
in
an
additional
200,000,
then
each
of
the
firms
could
get
its
600,000
and
walk
away
content.
but
we
don't
pursue
the
policy
in
favor
of
settlement
to
that
degree.
but
that's
essentially
what's
happening
here.
the
--
the
way
these
payments
facilitate
settlement
is
by
inducing
the
generics
to
agree
to
a
later
entry
date
by
increasing
the
total
pool
of
profits
that
are
available
to
the
two
firms
combined
and
thereby
maximizing
the
likelihood
that
each
firm
will
find
its
own
share
of
the
profit
satisfactory.
and
the
last
thing
i
would
say
is
i
think
everyone
who
comes
to
this
issue
recognized
that
there
is
a
conundrum.
our
natural
instinct
is
to
compare
the
settlement
to
the
expected
outcome
of
litigation.
but
everyone
also
recognizes
that
it
just
isn't
feasible
to
try
the
patent
suit.
and,
therefore,
our
approach
focuses
on
whether
the
competitive
process
has
been
preserved.
