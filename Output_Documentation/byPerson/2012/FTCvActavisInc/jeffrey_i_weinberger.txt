mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
respond
to
a
question
that
was
asked
of
my
friend
by
justice
scalia
a
few
minutes
ago.
he
was
asked
if
there
were
any
cases
in
which
the
court
has
ever
found
a
restraint
outside
the
scope
of
the
patent
to
be
unlawful,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
that
--
all
of
the
cases
that
have
found
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
based
on
a
patent-based
restraint
do
so
because
the
object
of
the
agreement,
the
restraint
that's
being
achieved
in
the
agreement,
is
beyond
the
scope
that
could
be
legitimately
achieved
with
a
patent.
for
example,
it's
an
attempt
to
control
downstream
the
resale
prices
of
--
of
products
that
you
cannot
do
simply
by
exercising
your
patent.
or
it's
an
attempt
to
control
the
sale
of
unpatented
products
that
go
beyond
what
a
patent
can
protect.
every
--
every
case
in
which--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
no,
justice
sotomayor,
i'm
not
arguing
that.
but
--
but
i
do
want
to
say
that
i
think
our
patent
system
depends
upon
the
notion
that
you
don't
evaluate
from
the
perspective
of
the
antitrust
laws
a
patent
restraint
based
upon
whether
you
could
have
proved
in
a
litigation
that
that
patent
--
that
the
patent
was
infringed.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
i
think
you're
not
--
you're
not
accepting
infringement.
what
you're
doing
is
recognizing
there's
a
reasonable
basis
to
assert
the
patent,
a
bona
fide
reasonable
dispute,
and
the
parties
have
the
ability
to
settle
the
dispute.
just
as
if
the
party
--
if
someone
was
entering
into
a
license
agreement
with
--
with
someone
who
had
a
product
that
they
claimed
did
not
infringe
the
patent,
they
sat
down,
negotiated
a
license
and
resolved
it--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
but
justice
sotomayor,
many
other--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--many
license
--
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
and
that's
because
many
license
disputes
are
in
fact
resolved
by
the
--
the
alleged
infringer
exiting
the
market
for
a
period
of
time,
or
agreeing
to
stay
off
until
a
certain
time.
and
then
the
license--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--yes,
they
are,
because
--
because,
for
example,
it
could
be
a
license
agreement
where
the
infringer
agrees
to
stay
off
the
market
for
x
number
of
years,
and
when
it
comes
on
it
pays
a
certain
royalty.
now,
anybody
could
argue
that
that
royalty,
if
it
were
higher,
could
result
in
an
earlier
entry.
there's
always
an
argument
to
be
made
with
any
delayed
entry
situation
that
monopoly
profits
are
shared.
that's
just
--
just
inherent
in
the
nature
of
it.
and
if
you
take
the
ftc's
argument
to
its
full
force,
it
would
mean
that
any
situation
where
anyone
is
agreeing
to
a
delayed
entry,
and
there's
any
other
value
that's
being
exchanged
in
that
situation,
that
in
effect
in
economic
terms
is
a
payment
for
delayed
entry.
there's
no
difference.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
i
--
i've
obviously
given
a
lot
of
thought
to
whether
there
is
any
kind
of
an
intermediary
test
that
works,
and
i
don't
believe
there
is.
let
me
explain
why.
first,
you
can't
really
measure
whether
there
were
any
anticompetitive
effects
from
such
a
settlement
agreement
without
determining
what
would
have
happened
if
the
case
hadn't
settled
and
it
would
have
been
litigated.
and
if
the
patentee
had
won
the
litigation,
then
there
would
be
no
anticompetitive
effects.
that's
what
the
second
circuit
and
the
federal
circuit
concluded
in
applying
the
rule
of
reason
test,
and
saying
the
first
condition
of
such
a
test
has
not
been
met,
because
there's
no
demonstration
of
anticompetitive
effects.
and
the
cases
--
both
of
those
cases
are
very
good
illustrations
of
what
i'm
talking
about.
those
were
the
tamoxifen
and
cipro
cases,
where
the
parties
agreed
to
so-called
reverse
payment
settlements
that
ftc
would
say
are
basically
per
se
lawful.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
well,
you
really
don't
know
unless
you
can
assume
when
they
could
have
entered--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--well,
because
it
all
depends
on
what
would
have
happened
in
the
patent
litigation.
so
that
you
can't
really
tell
whether
there's
any
anticompetitive
effect.
i
should
also
say
with
respect
to
the
generic
losing,
there's
really
no
risk
to
the
generic
here,
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
you
see
these
settlements,
that
in
this
industry--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--they're
--
they're
lower
than
they
would
be
under
some
other
situation,
but
--
but
the
patent
gave
the
patentholder
the
legal
right
to
exclude.
so
unless
there's
a
reason,
there's
some
reason
to
believe
that
it
couldn't
reasonably
assert
that
patent,
it's
entitled
to
monopoly
profits
for
the
whole
duration
of
the
patent.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
certainly.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
--
in
any
given
situation--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--i
--
i
think
that
if
the
--
if
it's
a
single
situation
and
the
evidence
is
that
there's
a
reasonable
basis
to
assert
that
patent
and
in
truth,
the
patent
has,
which
you
say,
has
a
50/50
chance
of
prevailing,
then
i
think
that
there
could
be
a
settlement
like
that,
if
it's
in
good
faith.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
any
--
any
situation
in
which
there's
any
--
in
any
patent
dispute
in
which
there's
a
tradeoff,
like
the
examples
i
mentioned
before,
time
for
value,
could
--
that
argument
could
be
made.
and,
in
fact,
if
that
was
true,
if
it
was
true
that
the
natural
inference
and
the
motivations
of
the
people
were
simply
to
divide
these
profits
with
no
other
consideration,
then
what
you'd
expect
to
see
is
that
every
single
patent
dispute,
especially
in
hatch-waxman
would
result
in
a
settlement
that
just
pays
the
generic
until
the
end
of
the
patent,
because
after
all,
the
market
would
be--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--let
me
address
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
realistic
at
all,
because
--
and
let's
take
this
industry
specifically.
that
the
ability
to
challenge
a
patent
in
this
industry
is
lower
than
any
industry
that
i
can
think
of,
and
that's
because
a
generic
is
given
the
right
to
certify
against
the
patent
and
then
basically
challenge
the
patent
without
having
actually
developed
the
product,
gotten
a
marketing
force,
gotten
a
factory,
putting
the
product
on
sale
and
taking
the
risk
that
everyone
else
who
challenges
a
patent
has
to
take.
all
they
have
to
do
is
--
is
file
an
nda,
which
is
roughly
300,000
to
$1
million
for
these
size
drugs,
that's
not
a
lot,
and
certify
it.
and
the
ftc's
own
studies
have
shown
that
it
takes
a
very
small
chance
of
winning,
something
like
4
percent
for
a
drug
over
$130
billion
to
justify
a
generic
suing
a
brand
name
company.
and
what
--
so
what
happens
in
these
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--it's
hatch-waxman
cases.
it's
because
of--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
the
second
circuit
recognized
that,
but
then
they
said
further
--
upon
further
reflection,
further
consideration
of
this,
we
are
not
troubled
by
it.
one
of
the
reasons
they
were
not
troubled,
it's
what
i
was
trying
to
answer
justice
kagan
about,
is
because
the
reality
of
the
situation
is
with
so
many
potential
challengers
to
the
patent,
all
they
have
to
do
is
file
an
nda,
there
are
200
generic
companies
in
this
industry,
that
if
you
try
to
adopt
that
strategy
of
paying
the
profits
of
a
generic,
there's
going
to
be
a
long
line
of--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--that's
clearly
not
correct
either
by
logic
or
by
reference
to
actual
experience.
it's
true
that
the
first
filer
is
given
a
greater
incentive,
but
these
products
can
last
for
20
or
25
years.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
experience
doesn't
show
that,
because
if
you
look
at
hatch-waxman
litigation,
we've
cited
in
--
in
the
red
brief
and
it's
been
discussed
by
the
antitrust
economists
and
the
generic
pharmaceutical
association
in
their
amicus
brief,
that
many
of
these
hatch-waxman
cases
involve
multiple
filers.
you
have
five,
10,
as
many
as
16
companies
challenging
these
patents,
all
of
--
one
of
whom
are
not
the
first
filer.
so
there
--
there
must
be
an
incentive
for
them
to
do
this,
and
--
and
they
are.
so
i
think
experience
says
that
that
kind
of
extreme
view
of
incentives
is
not
really
true.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
yes,
it's
in
the
--
in
the
solvay
brief
and
other
briefs.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
it's
a
big
advantage--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--it's
a
big
advantage.
it's
an
incentive
for
the
first
six
months,
i
don't
debate
that,
but
after
that,
the
market
opens
up.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
well,
i
think
the
first
problem
with
it
is
that
it's
--
it's
very
unpredictable.
it's
really
hard
to
figure
out
how
that
all
gets
sorted
out,
and
the
parties
who
are
sitting
down
to
do
a
settlement
need,
i
feel,
much
clearer
guidance.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
that's
right.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
i
--
i
believe
that
the
only
thing
that
brought--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--i
agree
with
that,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
think
that
an
alternative
test
--
the
only
alternative
test
that
could
be
fashioned
that
would
--
that
would
make
sense
is
one
based
on
strength
of
the
patent.
but
there
are
so
many
reasons
that
that
is
an
undesirable
result
that
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
the
way
this
court
should
go.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
let's
say
--
i
wouldn't
concede
that
most
cases
settle
like
that.
but
let's
--
let's
accept
that
and
take
the
case
of
a
--
of
a
strong
patent
or
a
patent
with
a
long
term.
let's
say
it
has
--
you
evaluate
the
strength
of
the
patent
and
you
conclude
that
it
has
10
or
15
good
years
remaining.
now,
you
have
a
generic
who
is
--
or
many
generics
who
have
sued
with
no
risk
or
minimal
risk
in
hatch-waxman,
and
their
response
is,
why
would
i
--
why
would
i
drop
this
lawsuit
to
get
an
entry
date
in
2025
or
2028?
that
doesn't
meet
my
business
needs,
i
have
shareholders,
i
have
investors,
i
have
to
run
a
business,
and
i'm
going
to
keep
on
litigating
unless
you
give
me
something
of
value.
so
that's
what
these
agreements
are
about.
they're
saying,
well,
what
other
--
remember,
this
is
not
just
a
cash
payment.
there
are
all--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--well,
first
of
all--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--first
of
all,
parties
often
don't
agree
on
the
merits.
parties
tend
to
be
overconfident.
they
both
think
they
are
going
to
win.
so
it's
sometimes
very
hard
to
come
to
a
consensus
where
entry
date
is
the
only
bargaining
chip
available.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
i
don't
know
where
the
evidence
would
be
for
that.
i
don't
think--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--actually,
we
have
ten
years
of
experience
since
the
circuit
courts
first
began
applying
scope-of-the-patent
tests
to
these
settlements
since
2003.
so
we
have
a
pretty
good
window
as
to
what
would
happen.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
no,
i
think
they
have
been
actually
very
steady.
they
are
roughly
between
25
and
30
percent,
pretty
much
constant
and
you
don't
really
see
any
huge
blips
depending
on
what
a
particular
court
is
ruling.
if
the
ftc's
kind
of
the-sky-is-going-to-fall
approach
is
right,
that
everybody's
going
to
run
out
and
do
this,
you
would
have
thought
that
after
the
first
eleventh
circuit
ruling,
after
the
federal
circuit
ruling,
after
the
second
circuit
ruling,
after
second
eleventh
circuit
ruling,
that
there
would
be
huge
increases
in
this,
but
we
haven't
seen
that.
some
of
the
numbers
increased
last
year,
but
as
a
percentage
of
the
total
settlements
they
are
very
steady.
they
are
pretty
much
the
same.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
justice
ginsburg,
first
of
all,
every
settlement
agreement
involving
one
of
these
cases
must
be
filed
with
the
ftc.
they
have
hundreds
of
them.
and
they
haven't
pointed
to
a
single
example
where
that's
the
case.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
yes,
and
i
want
to
make
clear
that
i
don't
think
that
could
happen,
because
if
a
brand
name
company
adopted
that
as
a
strategy
to
protect
its
patent,
it
would
--
it
would
be
held
up.
it
would
be
held
up
by
the
many
generic
companies
that
could
easily
challenge
these
patents
without
actually
having
a
manufactured
product,
without
putting
it
on
sale,
etcetera.
so
i
think
that
the
antitrust
rule
should
not
be
fashioned
to
deal
with
a
case
on
the
extreme,
which
hasn't
been
shown
to
happen,
which
logically
from
an
economic
point
of
view
is
highly
unlikely
to
happen.
and
if
for
some
reason
that
starts
happening
empirically,
then
congress
--
and
it
is
a
loophole
in
hatch-waxman
that
is
causing
that,
and
there
is
really
no
evidence
that
that
extreme
example
has
happened
--
then
congress
can
deal
with
it,
just
as
it
dealt
with
the
exclusivity
provision.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
well,
i
don't
see
any
examples
of
that
cited
in
their
brief.
it's
a
theory,
it's
a
hypothetical
theory,
but
there
is
no
data.
we
have
had
years
of
experience
with
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
of
course.
i
think
that's
true
in
many
--
many
patent
litigations.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
there
is
that
hypothetical
risk.
what
i'm
--
i
am
trying
to
make
the
point
that
it's
not
--
with
the
number
of
challenges
you
have
here,
which
is
basically
unlimited,
that
if
you
put
a
sign
around
your
neck
that
says,
paying
off
all
generic
companies
their
profits,
whoever
wants
to
challenge
my
patent
come
do
it,
there
is
going
to
be
a
long
line
of
people,
of
companies,
doing
it.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
it
is
true
and
that's
why
it
doesn't
happen.
it's
--
it's
more
true
here
because
it's
much
easier
to
challenge
a
patent.
so
in
any
other
industry
a
potential
challenger
has
to
make
a
major
investment
in
a
product,
has
to
get
it
manufactured,
has
to
put
it
on
sale,
and
then
litigate.
and
if
they
lose,
they
are
going
to
be
liable
for
enormous
damages.
that's
not
the
case
under
hatch-waxman.
all
they
need
to
do
is
file
an
anda.
they
have
nothing
at
risk.
if
they
lose,
they
haven't
lost
any
damages.
they
just
walk
away.
so
there
is
an
enormous
difference
in
the
risks
between
hatch-waxman
and
other
cases
that
explains
the
particular
form
of
some
of
these
settlements
and
why
they
happen.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
justice
sotomayor,
i
think
the
economic
reality
cuts
the
other
way.
it
doesn't
cut
in
favor
of
making
a
rule
that
makes
these
more
difficult.
what
i'm
saying
is
that--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--justice
sotomayor,
i
don't
think
the
legislation--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
hatch-waxman
that
supports
the
idea
that
the
purpose
was
to
provide
for
generic
entry
prior
to
patent
expiration.
what
the
structure
is
designed
to
do
is
encourage
challenges--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--i
don't
think
there
is
anything
in
hatch-waxman
that
suggests
in
any
way
that
settlements
or
--
should
be
discouraged
or
that
cases
should
be
mandated
to
proceed
to
judgment
or
that
all
have
to
be
litigated.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
it's
encouraging
challenges
and
it
has
produced
many
challenges.
and
can
i
say
that
with
10
years
of
the
application
of
the
scope-of-the-patent
rule,
there
is
no
particular
problem
with
hatch-waxman.
it's
working
very
well.
the
amount
--
the
number
of
drugs
that
have
now
gone
generic
from
just
10
years
ago
to
today
has
increased
enormously.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
well,
i
actually
think
that
you
raise
a
point
that
the
generic
--
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs,
some
of
the
generic
parties
have
talked
about,
which
is
that
their
ability
to
challenge
these
cases
depends
on
their
not
having
to
litigate
every
one
of
them
to
conclusion.
and
that's
not
bad,
because
most
patent
cases
settle.
most
--
most
of
these
disputes
settle.
and
if
our
system
was
one
in
which
every
case
had
to
be
litigated
fully
to
judgment,
we
would
be
unable
to
cope
with
that.
so
--
so
what
i
think
the
statute
mandates
or
contemplates
is
that
generics
should
be
able
to
challenge,
and
should
have
strong
incentive
to
challenge,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
should
be
required
to
litigate
to
conclusion.
and
if
settlement
is
made
more
difficult
so
that
different
perceptions
or
different
business
objectives
can't
be
bridged
with
some
kind
of
a
business
settlement,
that
is
going
to
mean
that
fewer
generics
are
going
to
challenge
these
patents
and
that
is
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
hatch-waxman
act.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
this
particular
drug,
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
there
are
lots
of
studies
of
how
much
average
drugs
cost,
and
that
figure
is
over
a
billion
dollars.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
easily
a
billion
dollars.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
this
particular
drug--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--no,
because
we
are
on
a
12(b)(6)
motion
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
so
none
of
that
was
ever
developed,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--but
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
the
--
of
course,
any
given
drug
development
cost
doesn't
even
begin
to
tell
the
picture,
because
for
every
drug
that
succeeds,
there
are
at
least
10
that
fail,
and
all
the
costs
that
are
involved
in
the
drugs
that
fail
have
to
be
covered
with
the
one
drug
that
succeeds.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
not
completely.
first
of
all,
it
depends
on
the
--
the
agreement.
for
example,
in
this
case,
that
180-day
exclusivity
was
waived.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
this
was
the
exact
problem
that
congress
addressed
in
2003,
when
it
amended
hatch-waxman
and
changed
the
exclusivity
requirements.
so
the
way
the
law
now
reads
is
that
subsequent
generics,
subsequent
filers
can
trigger
that
180-day
exclusivity
by
continuing
to
litigate.
so,
if
the
first
filer
settles
and
these
other
folks
are
in
line
and
they're
litigating,
they
can
force
that
period
to
start
running
and
then
they
can
come
in
right
after.
so,
it
is
not
correct
that
you
can
tie
up
the
first
filer
in
settlement
and
prevent
everybody
else
from
entering.
and
even
before
that
amendment,
the
eleventh
circuit,
federal
circuit
in
the
second,
applying
the
scope
of
the
patent
rule
recognized
that
if
the
agreement
creates
a
bottleneck
to
other
filers
that
goes
beyond
what
the
statutory
exclusivity
provides,
where
they
agree
not
to
give
up
their
exclusivity
or
agree
to
retain
it,
then
that's
beyond
the
scope
of
the
patent,
because
you
can't
achieve
that
kind
of
a
restraint
simply
--
with
a
patent,
you
--
you're
using
the
agreement
to
expand
upon
your
patent
rights
to
block
other
filers.
so
i
think
that
problem's
been
addressed
by
congress.
and
if
somebody
feels
that
solution's
not
perfect
and
they
want
to
make
it
even
easier
for
subsequent
filers
to
come
in,
then
i
submit
that
congress
can
do
that.
that
they--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--the
change
that
was
made,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
--
there
were
a
number
of
changes,
but
the
one
that's
relevant
here
is
that
if
a
--
if
a
subsequent
filer
--
strike
that.
you
can
trigger
the
exclusivity
beginning
to
run
by
getting
the
judgment.
so,
in
the
past,
if
a
first
filer
settled
and
they
just
didn't
do
anything
--
may
i
finish
the--
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
--and
they
just
didn't
do
anything,
that
would
prevent
other
generics
from
coming
to
market.
but
now
anybody
else
who's
litigating
the
patent,
if
they
go
ahead
and
win
their
case,
then
that
--
that
triggers
the
first
filer's
rights
and
if
they
don't
exercise
that
--
those
rights
within
75
days,
they're
gone,
they're
forfeited.
so
that's
the
change.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
i.
weinberger
thank
you,
your
honor.
