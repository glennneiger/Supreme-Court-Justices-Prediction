justice

why
--
why
are
payments
not
to
compete
different
from,
let's
say,
dividing
a
market?
i
mean,
suppose
there's
a
lawsuit,
somebody
challenging
the
validity
of
the
patent,
and
the
patentee
agrees
to
allow
the
person
challenging
the
patent
to
have
exclusive
--
exclusive
rights
to
sell
in
a
particular
area.
does
that
violate
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
--
that
doesn't
impress
me.
what
else?
what's
your
second
point?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
in
order
to
make
money.
i
mean,
that's
--
that's
what
it
wants
is
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
instead
of
giving
them
a
license
to
compete
--
you
know,
we'll
short-circuit
the
whole
thing,
here's
the
money.
go
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
do
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
patentee
acting
within
the
scope
of
the
patent
has
nonetheless
been
held
liable
under
the
antitrust
laws--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
something
that
it's
done
acting
within
the
scope
of
the
patent?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
--
this
was
not
a
problem,
i
gather,
until
the
hatch-waxman
amendments?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
and
so
--
and
so
do
suits
against
this
kind
of
payment.
and
i
have
--
i
have
the
feeling
that
what
happened
is
that
hatch-waxman
made
a
mistake.
it
did
not
foresee
that
it
would
produce
this
kind
of
--
this
kind
of
payment.
and
in
order
to
rectify
the
mistake
the
ftc
comes
in
and
brings
in
a
new
interpretation
of
antitrust
law
that
did
not
exist
before,
just
to
make
up
for
the
mistake
that
hatch-waxman
made,
even
though
congress
has
tried
to
cover
its
tracks
in
later
amendments,
right,
which
--
which
deter
these,
these
--
these
payments?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
why
should
we
overturn
understood
antitrust
laws
just
to
--
just
to
patch
up
a
mistake
that
hatch-waxman
made?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
--
you
can't
possibly
figure
it
out,
can
you,
without
assessing
the
strength
of
the
patent?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
crucial
to
--
to
the
conclusion?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
say
you
can
consider
every
other
factor
other
than
the
strength
of
the
patent
is
--
is
to
leave
--
leave
out
the
--
the
elephant
in
the
room.
