mr.
stewart,
can
we
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
initial
question.
it's
rare
that
we
find
a
per
se
antitrust
violation.
most
situations
we
put
it
into
rule
of
reason.
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
this
is
price
fixing,
a
reverse
payment
like
price
fixing
so
that
it
has
to
fall
into
something
greater
than
the
rule
of
reason.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
why
is
the
rule
of
reason
so
bad?
as
an
--
and
that's
really
my
bottom
line,
because
you're
creating
all
--
i
think
that's
what
justice
breyer
was
saying.
i
mean,
for
--
for
example,
i
have
difficulty
understanding
why
the
mere
existence
of
a
reverse
payment
is
presumptively
gives
--
changes
the
burden
from
the
plaintiff.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
have
to
bear
the
burden
--
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
payment
for
services
or
the
value
given
was
too
high.
i
don't
know
why
it
has
to
shift
to
the
other
side.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
answer
the
more
fundamental
question:
why
is
the
rule
of
reason
so
bad?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
why
isn't
this
then?
meaning
there
is
no
presumption
of
infringement.
there's
no
presumption
that
the
item
that
someone
else
is
going
to
sell
necessarily
infringes.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
what
you're
arguing
is
that
in
fact
a
settlement
of
an
infringement
action
is
now
creating
that
presumption.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
don't
know,
but
i
don't
know
why
we
would
be
required
to
accept
that
there
has
or
would
be
infringement
by
the
product
that
has
voluntarily
decided
not
to
pursue
its
rights.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there,
you'd
know
that
they're
not
sharing
the
profits.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
meaning
there
you
know
that
a
--
a
product's
been
licensed
and
the
--
that's
normal.
the
infringer
is
now
paying
the
other
side
money
to
sell
that
product.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
a
reverse
payment
suggests
something
different,
that
they're
sharing
profits.
i
don't
know
what
else
you
can
conclude.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
not
many
for
reverse
payments.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
is
that
in
all
cases
or
just
hatch-waxman
cases?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
because
it
does
skew
the
dynamics
a
lot.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
you
know,
the
second
circuit
recognized,
even
though
it
accepted
your
scope
of
the
patent,
that
there
was
a
troubling
dynamic
in
what
you're
arguing,
which
is
that
the
less
sound
the
patent,
the
more
you're
going
to
hurt
consumers,
because
those
are
the
cases
where
the
payoff,
the
sharing
of
profits
is
the
greatest
inducement
for
the
patentholder.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
for
whom?
and
--
and
--
you
know,
the
government
is
basically
saying,
we
really
don't
want
reverse
payments,
period.
we
want
people
to
settle
this
the
way
they
should
settle
it,
which
is
on
the
strength
of
the
patent.
and
that
means
settling
it
simply
by
either
paying
a
royalty
for
use
or
settling
as
most
cases
do,
on
an
early
entry
alone,
so
there's
no
sharing
of
--
of
--
of
profits.
what's
so
bad
about
that?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
deprive
either
side
of
the
ability
to
finish
the
litigation
if
they
want
to.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
in
the
normal
course,
if
the
patent's
really
strong,
if
you
get
a
year
or
two
earlier
entry,
that
has
an
inherent
value,
and
that's
what
you'll
pay
for
is
what
the
government
is
saying.
that
will
be
the
determination
the
two
parties
will
make,
which
is
at
what
point
is
earlier
entry
worth
it--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--for
the
very
strong
patentholder.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
they
pointed
to
most
settlements
and
say
that
is
the
vast
majority.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
well,
we
do
know
that
these
reverse
payments,
except
for
recent
times
when
people
figured
out
they
were
so
valuable,
were
the
exception,
not
the
rule.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
have
been
increasing
in
number,
not
decreasing.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
see
that
as
an
argument
that
there
is
an
economic
reality
in
hatch-waxman
that
would
require
us
not
to
apply
any
rule
we
choose
or
accept
here
to
other
situations;
only
here.
that's
the
argument
that
you're
creating
for
me,
that
there's
a
different
economic
reality
here
that
requires
a
different
rule.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
oh,
but
it
does,
because
in
hatch-waxman
congress
decided
that
there
was
a
benefit
for
generics
entering
without
suffering
a
potential
loss
to
enter
the
market
more
quickly.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
and
any
settlement
in
these
cases
deprives
consumers
of
the
potential
of
having
the
benefit
of
an
earlier
entry.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
exactly,
and
what
you
are
doing
with
permitting
settlements
of
this
kind
is
not
permitting
the
process
to
go
to
conclusion.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
it's
encouraging
infringement
suits.
