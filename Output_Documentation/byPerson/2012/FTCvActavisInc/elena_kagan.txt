justice
elena
kagan
mr.
weinberger,
can
i
just
understand
what
you're
saying,
and
maybe
do
it
through
a
hypothetical.
justice
elena
kagan
suppose
you
had
a
--
a
lawsuit
and
the
generic
sends
the
brand
name
manufacturer
an
e-mail
and
the
e-mail
says,
we
have
this
lawsuit,
i
think
i
have
about
a
50
percent
chance
of
winning.
if
i
win,
i
take
your
--
your
monopoly
profits
down
from
100
million
to
$10
million.
wouldn't
it
be
a
good
thing
if
you
just
gave
me
25
million?
all
right?
and
then
the
brand
name
sends
an
e-mail
back,
says
--
you
know,
that
seems
like
a
pretty
good
idea,
so
i'll
give
you
25
million.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
your
argument
is,
i
mean,
that's
just
fine.
that's
hunky
dory.
justice
elena
kagan
is
that
fine?
justice
elena
kagan
even
though
--
but
what
if
it
isn't
in
good
faith?
it's
clear
what's
going
on
here
is
that
they're
splitting
monopoly
profits
and
the
person
who's
going
to
be
injured
are
all
the
consumers
out
there.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
mr.
weinberger,
i
think
if
we
give
you
the
rule
that
you're
suggesting
we
give
you,
that
is
going
to
be
the
outcome,
because
this
is
going
to
be
the
incentive
of
both
the
generic
and
the
brand
name
manufacturer
in
every
single
case
is
to
split
monopoly
profits
in
this
way
to
the
detriment
of
all
consumers.
justice
elena
kagan
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
true,
mr.
weinberger,
and
it's
because
of
something
that
justice
scalia
suggested,
that
there's
a
kind
of
glitch
in
hatch-waxman,
and
the
glitch
is
that
the
180
days
goes
to
the
first
filer.
and
once
the
180-day
first
filer
is
bought
off,
nobody
else
has
the
incentive
to
do
this.
justice
elena
kagan
but
the
--
the
huge
percentage
of
the
profits
is
done
in
the
exclusivity
period.
i
mean,
it's
true
that
it
can
go
on
for
a
long
time,
but
you're
making
dribs
and
drabs
of
money
for
a
long
time.
where
you're
really
making
your
money
is
in
the
180
days.
justice
elena
kagan
but
it's
just
an
economic--
justice
elena
kagan
--i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
justice
elena
kagan
could
i
just
make
sure
i
understand
the
way
the
180-day
period
worked?
the
first
filer
gets
it,
if
i
buy
off
--
if
i'm
a
brand
name
manufacturer
and
i
buy
off
the
first
filer
with
one
of
these
reverse
payments,
you're
suggesting
that
that's
not
going
to
do
me
much
good
because
they're
all
going
to
be
--
there's
going
to
be
a
long
line.
and
that
long
line
of
people,
it's
not
just
that
they
don't
get
the
180-day
period,
it's
like
even
if
one
of
those
people
wins,
the
person
whom
i've
paid
off
is
going
to
get
the
180-day
exclusivity
period;
isn't
that
right?
justice
elena
kagan
but
if
it's
not
waived
by
the
parties,
in
other
words,
it's
just
like
i
don't
get
it
so
my
incentives
go
down.
it's
that
my
competitor
gets
it.
so
why
in
the
world
am
i
standing
in
line
to
--
to
challenge
this
if
my
competitor
is
going
to
get
the
exclusive
period?
justice
elena
kagan
and
what's
your
understanding
of
why
there
would
not
be
a
long
line
in
some
cases
or
in
many
cases?
justice
elena
kagan
and
is
there
anything
to
show
what
i
think
justice
kennedy
asked
--
you
know,
how
much
of
one's
profits
comes
from
the
180-day
period
as
opposed
to
what
happens
after
that?
