justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
doesn't
mean
that
--
that's
rather
thin.
i
don't
know
how
--
i
don't
have
the
ability
to
assess
that,
the
significance
of
it,
empirically.
the
thing
i
wonder,
therefore,
you
said
it's
common
in
antitrust?
i'm
--
i'm
not
up
to
everything
in
the
field,
but
i
know
there's
an
existence
of
something
called
the
per
se
rule,
let's
price
fix
it.
i
know
there's
a
rule
of
reason,
and
i
know
there's
a
sort
of
vague
area
that
sometimes
in
some
cases
that
justice
souter
mentioned
in
california
dental,
there
is
something
slightly
in
between,
which
as
i
saw
those
cases,
they're
very
much
like
price
fixing
or
--
or
agreements
not
to
enter.
and
what
they
seem
to
say
is,
judge,
pay
attention
to
the
department
when
it
says
that
these
are
very
often
can
be
anticompetitive,
and
ask
the
defendant
why
he's
doing
it.
i
mean,
is
that
what
you
want
us
to
say?
it
didn't
seem
in
your
briefs
as
if
you
were.
if
you
were
asking
us
to
produce
some
kind
of
structure
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
pejorative,
but
it's
rigid
--
a
whole
set
of
complex
per
se
burden
of
proof
rules
that
i
have
never
seen
in
other
antitrust
cases,
i
--
my
question
is,
when
i
say
i've
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
in
terms
of
procedure,
i
want
you
to
refer
me
to
a
case
that
will
show,
oh,
no,
i'm
out
of
date.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
are
there
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
other?
are
you
familiar
with
any
other?
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
read
all
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
there
are
few
or
none,
then
i
would
say
why
isn't
the
government
satisfied
with
an
opinion
of
this
court
that
says,
yes,
there
can
be
serious
anticompetitive
effects;
yes,
sometimes
there
are
business
justifications;
so,
judge,
keep
that
in
mind.
ask
him
why
he
has
this
agreement;
ask
him
what
his
justification
is,
and
see
if
there's
a
less
restrictive
alternative.
in
other
words,
it's
up
to
the
district
court,
as
in
many
complex
cases,
to
structure
their
case
with
advice
from
the
attorneys.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
got
guidance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
same
thing
is
appropriate
as
is
appropriate
in
any
antitrust
case.
are
there
anticompetitive
effects?
i
have
32
briefs
here
that
explain
very
clearly
what
you
said
in
a
sentence.
it
may
be
that
they're
simply
dividing
the
monopoly
profit.
i
understand
that
--
you
know,
i
can
take
that
in
and
so
can
every
judge
in
the
country.
and
what's
complicated
about
that?
and
then
i
have
some
very
nice
dark
green
briefs
that
clearly
say,
four
instances,
maybe
five,
where
there
would
be
offsetting
justifications.
i
think
they
can
get
that,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
mention
at
least
two
others.
the
first
one
they
mention
is
because
the
person's
already
in
the
market
thinks
that
the
next
year
or
two
or
three
years
is
worth
$100
million
a
year,
and
the
person
who's
suing
thinks
it's
worth
30
million
a
year.
and
so
he
says,
hey,
i
have
a
great
idea,
i'll
give
him
the
30
million
and
keep
the
70.
and
--
and
that,
i
don't
see
why
that's
anticompetitive
if
that's
what's
going
on.
and
the
second
instance
they
bring
up
is
that
it's
very
hard
to
break
into
a
market.
so
for
the
new
generic
to
come
in,
he's
thinking,
giving
me
two
years
isn't
worth
much,
because
i'll
spend
a
lot
of
money,
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
do
it.
but
the
defendant
--
the
defendant
who
wants
this
patent
kept
intact
says,
i
will
not
only
let
--
i'll
let
you
in
a
year
earlier
and
i'll
give
you
enough
money
so
that
you
can
start
up
a
distribution
system.
the
second
seems
procompetitive;
the
first,
neutral.
the
problem
of
deciding
whether
other
matters
are
or
are
not
really
payments
for
something
else,
a
true
nightmare
when
you
start
talking
about
five
drugs
and
different
distribution
systems,
and
the
matter
of
whether
you're
paying
for
litigation
costs,
a
matter
of
great
debate
for
the
judge.
okay.
that's
the
arguments
that
they
make.
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i
mean,
professor
areeda,
who
is
at
least
in
my
mind
a
minor
deity
in
the
matter,
in
this
area,
if
not
major,
he
explains
it.
he
says
don't
try
for
more
precision
than
you
can
give.
the
quality
of
proof
required
should
vary
with
the
circumstances.
do
you
know
how
long
it
took
--
i
mean,
and
i
--
of
course,
i
--
i
know
a
little
bit
of
antitrust.
but
i
mean,
i
think
--
do
you
know
how
long
it
takes
to
take
in
your
basic
argument
that
these
sometimes
can
be
a
division
of
profit,
monopoly
profit?
it
takes
probably
3
minutes
or
less.
and
judges
can
do
that.
so
you
say
to
the
judge:
judge,
this
is
what's
relevant
here.
and
there's
a
rule
of
evidence:
don't
waste
the
jury's
time.
so
--
so
you
shape
the
case
as
--
and
this
is
what
goes
--
used
to
go
on
for
40
years.
you
shape
the
case
in
light
of
the
considerations
that
are
actually
relevant,
useful
and
provable
in
respect
to
that
case.
and
district
judges,
that's
their
job.
so
--
so
what
--
i'm
not
saying
you'd
lose
the
case.
they
didn't
side
with
the
eleventh
circuit.
they
said
there's
no
violation,
okay?
i've
got
your
point
on
that.
but
--
but
i'm
worried
about
creating
some
kind
of
administrative
monster.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
but
there,
it's
not
--
their
point
is
not
it's
per
se
unlawful.
what
they
want
is
they
want
to
cut
some
kind
of
line
between
a
per
se
rule
and
the
kitchen
sink.
and
if
you
look
at
the
brief
supporting
you,
it
is
the
kitchen
sink.
you
have
economists
attacking
the
patent
system
or
praising
it,
da,
da,
da,
and
here
and
there
and
the
other.
they
don't
want
the
kitchen
sink.
now,
suppose
i
don't
want
the
kitchen
sink,
but
i
have
a
hard
time
saying
what
the
per
se
rule
is.
so
what's
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
suppose--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
suppose
--
this
sounds
like
an
argument,
a
discussion
that
you
have
in
the
district
court,
so
--
so
why
--
what's
your
reaction
to
this:
say
a,
sometimes
these
settlements
can
be
very
anticompetitive,
dividing
monopoly
profit.
in
deciding
whether
anticompetitive
outweighs
business
practices
without
less
restrictive
alternatives,
judge,
you
may
take
that
into
account;
2,
do
not
take
into
account
the
strength
of
a
patent;
3,
do
not
try
to
relitigate
the
patent.
4,
there
are
several
possible
justifications,
ones
i
listed
before
out
of
the
briefs,
litigation
costs
--
the
other
products,
different
assessments
of
--
of
value.
5,
there
could
be,
in
fact,
no
anticompetitive
effect
here
because
of
what
you
just
said
now
in
response
to
justice
kennedy
and
justice
kagan,
but
there
could
be.
we
don't
know.
okay?
so,
start
with
where
we
were.
could
be
anticompetitive.
give
the
defense
a
chance
to
go
through
five,
1
through
5,
and
if
they
convince
you
there
is
a
6,
we're
not
saying
there
isn't,
but
we
can't
think
of
one
on
the
briefs,
let
them
have
the
6th,
too.
now,
judge,
weigh
and
decide.
that's
what
we
do.
so
we've
structured
it
somewhat
to
keep
the
kitchen
sink
out
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
given
to
us.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
does
it
help
you
to
say,
if
the
court
says
or
the
ftc
says
when
you
get
one
of
these
suits
you
can
settle
it
by
letting
them
in,
but
you
can't
pay
them
money,
that
that
will
help
to
stop
strike
suits.
it
costs
them
nothing
to
get
in.
they
have
to
really
want
to
enter
or
they
won't
bring
lawsuits.
so
why
does
that
hurt
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
a
pretty
complex
antitrust
patent
case
and
it's
about
what's
called
the
reverse
payment
settlement.
a
drug
company
that
has
government
approval
to
sell
its
drug
called
androgel
sues
for
patent
infringement
generic
drug
makers
who
want
government
approval
to
sell
their
chemically
similar
drugs
in
competition
with
androgel.
the
company
is
all
settled
and
the
terms
in
effect
the
generics
pharmacies
will
stay
out
of
the
market
for
a
certain
period
of
time
and
the
patent
owner,
androgel's
maker
in
return
pays
them
many
millions
of
dollars.
the
federal
trade
commission
sued
the
settling
party
claiming
that
this
reverse
payment,
it's
called
a
reverse
payment
because
normally,
if
you
sue
an
infringer,
you
would
expect
maybe
the
infringer
would
pay
something
to
the
guy
who's
suing
you,
but
this
versus
the
other
way,
it's
the
patent
holder,
you
can
skip
that.
in
any
case,
the
federal
trade
commission
sued
the
settling
parties
claiming
that
this
reverse
payment
settlement
agreement
violates
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
settlement
agreement
couldn't
violate
the
antitrust
laws
because
it
falls
within
the
scope
of
the
patent.
that
is
the
patent
allowed
the
maker
of
the
drug
to
monopolize
the
market
anyway
and
the
settlement
agreement
didn't
really
do
anymore
than
that.
now,
we
do
not
agree
with
the
circuit.
we
find
that
the
party's
contested
behavior
does
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
patent.
a
valid
patent
of
course
would've
permitted
the
patent
holder
to
keep
everybody
else
namely
the
generics
out
of
the
market,
but
an
invalid
patent
would
have
not
permitted
the
patent
holder
to
do
that.
and
here,
the
validity
of
the
patent
is
not
--
made
--
is
being
challenged.
you
don't
know.
it
could
be
the
one,
it
could
be
the
other.
so,
as
our
precedent
suggests
in
order
to
analyze
this
case
correctly
we
have
to
go
beyond
the
statement
it's
within
the
scope
of
the
patent
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
competing
aims
of
patent
law
and
antitrust
law
and
determine
here
which
predominate.
doing
that,
we
first
conclude
that
the
reverse
payments
settlements
at
least
sometimes
pose
a
risk
of
adverse
effects
on
competition.
they
threaten
to
allow
patent
holders
and
potential
competitors
to
split
and
thereby
maintain
super
competitive
patent
related
profits
even
where
the
patent
would
end
up
being
held
invalid
or
would
it
be
infringed
or
the
generic
to
enter
the
market.
suppose,
for
example,
the
patent
has
ten
years
to
run
and
earns
its
holder
$50
million
dollars
per
year
of
extra
profits
because
the
patent
gives
that
holder
an
exclusive
right
to
make
him
sell
the
drug,
a
finding
of
invalidity
or
entry
by
a
generic
might
reduce
that
500
million,
maybe
all
the
way
to
zero,
but
a
settlement
agreement
removes
that
threat
in
return
for
a
payment
of
say
$100
million,
keeps
out
of
the
marketplace
for
that
hundred
million,
the
patent
challenging
generic
and
the
consumer
pays
more
than
if
the
generic
have
not
received
the
$100
million
payment
and
had
consequently
continued
it's
efforts
to
enter
or
maybe
it's
settled
in
other
ways
and
it
ended
up
by
entering
thereby
producing
a
more
competitive
marketplace.
second
and
on
the
other
hand,
we
concede
that
a
reverse
payment
of
this
type
may
sometimes
prove
justified.
suppose
it
simply
reflects
savings
in
litigation
costs
or
the
fair
value
paid
for
other
services
that
the
generic
promises
to
perform,
but
then
there
are
other
times
the
reverse
payment
may
serve
no
such
purpose.
it
may
simply
lead
the
generic
to
agree
it
will
not
enter
the
market.
delayed
market
entry
considered
in
and
off
itself
alone
is
an
antitrust
law
and
typically,
not
justified
or
it
could
be.
third,
the
patent
holder
might
have
power
perhaps
conferred
by
the
patent
itself
to
charge
prices
above
the
competitive
level,
so
the
agreement
could
have
a
significant
anticompetitive
effect.
fourth,
the
court
should
be
able
to
administer
this
kind
of
antitrust
case
normally
without
too
much
difficulty.
suppose
the
payment
is
large
and
it
serves
no
legitimate
purpose,
at
that
point
a
court
may
well
be
able
to
assume
without
getting
into
the
complex
business
of
trying
to
relitigate
the
patent's
validity.
it
may
simply
assume
because
it
has
no
reason
to
think
the
contrary
that
the
patentee
is
worried
about
the
strength
of
the
patent,
maybe
it's
too
weak,
and
though
he
is
seeking
to
split
and
thereby
to
maintain
the
super
competitive
profits
in
order
to
avoid
that
new
competition.
and
finally,
the
patent
--
the
parties,
of
course,
remain
free
to
settle
their
patent
litigation
in
other
ways
that
do
not
pose
similar
risks
of
significant
unjustified
anticompetitive
harm,
say,
by
agreeing
that
the
generic
can
just
enter
earlier,
then
it
otherwise
would
seem
to
be
able
to
enter
under
the
patent.
so,
we
consequently
conclude
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
near
automatic
rule
of
antitrust
immunity
is
incorrect.
we
also
reject
the
ftc's
claim
that
reverse
payment
settlements
are
near
automatically
unlawful.
rather
we
conclude
that
the
ftc
should
apply
a
rule
of
reason
as
we
describe
it
and
it
may
proceed
with
the
case
on
that
basis.
we
discuss
these
matters
further
in
our
opinion.
the
chief
justice

filed

dissenting
opinion
in
