mr.
robert
t.
fishman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
friend
started
with
section
16.
i'd
like
to
start
very
briefly
with
our
reading
of
the
fee
provision
itself.
section
15(e)(1),
which
says,
"any
petition
filed
under
section
11
is
eligible
for
award
of
attorneys'
fees,
even
if
it's
denied,
provided
that
two
conditions
are
satisfied.
"
"it
has
to
be
filed
in
good
faith
and
with
a
reasonable
basis.
"
15(e)
itself
and
by
its
terms
says
nothing
about
compliance
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
filing
provisions
of
section
11,
which
are
section
11(a)(1)
similarly
say
nothing
about
compliance
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
our
position,
therefore,
is
the
most
direct
and
sensible
reading
of
15(e)(1)
is
you
can
get
an
award
of
fees
on
a
petition
that
has
been
denied
regardless
of
the
reason
why,
and
there
is
no
textual
basis
for
saying
that
that
provision
carves
out
an
exception
for
one
class
of
denied
cases,
those
denied
on
limitations
grounds.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
right.
and
if
i
understand
that
comment
correctly,
i
think
that's
right,
and
--
and
you
see
actually
many
special
master
decisions
that
ultimately
deny
a
petition
for
failure
typically
to
prove
causation;
and
when
they
turn
to
the
reasonable
basis
standard,
they
will
say
literally,
your
contact
--
your
client
contacted
you
two
days
before
the
statute
of
limitations
was
going
to
run.
you
ran
to
the
courthouse
and
filed.
you
had
a
basis,
we
believe,
for
filing
your
claim.
further
investigation,
examination
of
the
medical
--
medical
records
made
you
question
that
judgment,
and
you
abandoned
the
case.
and
--
and
there
can
be
fee
awards
in
--
in
that
scenario.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i
think
that
would
depend
--
if
--
if
you're
late,
you're
late.
i
think
the
--
the
judgment
your
hypothetical
would
call
on
the
attorney
to
make
is,
why
did
we
miss
it,
and
maybe
does
that
provide
grounds
for
equitable
tolling
or
do
we
have
a
reasonable
and
good
faith
argument
as
to
timeliness?
if
the
lawyer
says,
i
blew
it,
whether
by
a
day
or
a
month
or
a
year,
i
think
that
attorney's
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
time
showing
a
good
faith
reasonable
basis
for
filing
a
claim
that
i
think
in
your
hypothetical
would
be
by
the
attorney's
own
account,
clearly
time
barred
without
justification.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
that
is
what
we're
saying.
that's
also
what
the
federal
circuit
said.
i
think
the
word
“
claim
”
as
it's
used
in
the
statute
encompasses
the
entire
case,
causation,
evidence
that
you
actually
received
a
vaccine,
the
timeliness
of
your
petition,
damages,
the
--
everything
you
would
need
to
establish--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--there's
a
number
of
arguments
about
--
about
that
subject.
and
i
think
the
starting
point,
because
it
may
have
been
lost
a
little
bit
in
the
briefs,
is
the
government
does
not
cite
a
single
case
where
there
has
ever
even
been
a
hearing
held
on
a
fee
petition,
ever.
and
collectively
are--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
they
are
accumulated
--
the
system
that's
established
is
one
of
front-loading.
you
--
11(c)
requires
an
enormous
amount
of
medical
documentation
that
is
to
be
filed
with
the
petition
when
it's
filed.
if
they
are
incomplete,
you're
required
to
submit
an
affidavit
explaining
what's
missing
and
why.
the
very
first
thing
substantively
that
happens
with
these
things,
vaccine
act
rule
4(a)
says
within
30
days
of
filing
a
petition,
the
secretary
must
review
the
medical
records,
and
if
she
thinks
they
are
deficient,
she
has
to
immediately
notify
the
petitioner,
and
that
is
the
very
first
thing
that
is
hashed
out
in
these
cases,
complete
medical
records.
section
--
vaccine
act
rule
2(c)(2)
says
if
you're
not
going
to
rely
solely
on
medical
records
in
support
of
your
petition
--
medical
records
will
often
contain
evidence
of
causation.
if
the
records
themselves
don't
and
you're
going
to
go
outside
the
records,
vaccine
act
rule
2(c)
--
2(b)(2)
is
the
actual
rule,
says
you're
going
to
rely
on
observations
or
testimony
of
every
witness,
any
witness,
you
have
to
submit
a
detailed
affidavit
of
the
proposed
testimony
that
supports
every
allegation
in
the
petition.
so
the
answer
is:
a
lot
of
it's
there
right
at
the
front
end,
which
is
not
to
say
that
as
these
cases
get
litigated
and
the
areas
of
contention
get
refined,
additional
information
can
also
be
submitted,
but
it
is
front
loaded.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
sure.
and
that's
the
reason
why
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
routinely
these
cases
are
decided
--
fee
determinations
are
made
based
on
the
written
materials
without
a
hearing,
without
any
additional
evidence.
and
again
there
are
no
cases
--
we
are
not
aware
of
a
single
instance
going
to
the
inception
of
this
program
where
there
has
ever
been
an
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
yes,
the
law
is
pretty
clear
that
fees
are
available
for
time
incurred
on
seeking
fees.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i
think
that
might
well
be
within
a
special
master's
discretion
if
it
really
is
going
--
if
a
fee
determination
really
will
require
the
sort
of
parade
of
horribles
that
the
government
sees.
it's
not
our
case,
but
i
think
it
could
be
possible
and
--
and
within
their
discretion
in
a
subsequent
case.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
correct.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i
don't
know
--
the
--
no
court
and
the
parties
have
not
briefed
or
addressed
in
this
case
the
--
the
extent
to
which
the
“
may
”
discretion
can
be
exercised
in
a
procedural
way
that
justice
kagan's
hypothetical
proposes.
i'm
just
saying,
i
can't
stand
here
and
give
you
a
hard
and
fast
rule
that
says
that
will
never
be
appropriate.
maybe
if
that
case
comes
before
a
court
and
a
special
master
has
done
that,
the
argument
will
be
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
those
are
the
requirements
to
be
eligible
for
an
award
of
fees,
the
statutory
requirements
for
eligibility.
but
just
because
you
meet
good
faith
and
reasonable
basis
does
not
necessarily
mean
you
get
fees,
for
the
--
for
the
reasons
just
discussed.
it
is
discretionary.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i
think
it
might
be.
there
--
the
law
is
not
--
this
is
not
the
issue
in
our
case,
so
it's
--
it's
--
it's
difficult
to
know
the
precise
contours
of
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
a
case
where
nobody's
contended
that
the
discretion
couldn't
properly
be
exercised.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
the
--
i
will
take
the
second
part
first,
reasonableness
of
statute
of
limitations.
the
federal
circuit
has
already
ruled
that
we
were
reasonable
to
bring
this
case
in
terms
of
timeliness,
because
of
the
case
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed,
the
fact
that
we
actually
prevailed
on
the
timeliness
question
before
the
three-judge
panel.
so
the
federal
--
i
think
on
that
question
the
federal
circuit
has
resolved
it.
but
if
you
want
to
go
beyond
that,
i
think
you
would
look
at
our
briefs
and
the
laws
that
existed
and
the
analysis
of
the
various
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
and
said
--
and
say,
that
was
a
close
call,
you
actually
prevailed
for
a
couple
years
on
this
question.
that's
reasonable,
and
that's
good
faith.
as
to
the
merits,
it
is
all
the
material
that
accompanied
our
petition
which
is
principally
medical
records,
also
some
medical
studies
linking
the
hepatitis
b
vaccine
to
ms,
and
then
a
number
of
affidavits
that
were
filed
subsequently.
and
i
think
that
is
all
you
would
need
to
look
at,
and
--
that
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record.
because
the
government
has
introduced
no
evidence
in
this
case
at
any
stage
contesting
the
merits
of
our
underlying
claim.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
the
reason
is
you
have
to
remember
this
is
not
ordinary
civil
litigation;
it's
a
streamlined
front-loaded
process.
so
the
way
the
vaccine
act
works
is
you
file
a
petition
with
medical
records,
as
i
mentioned
before.
you
have
30
days
for
the
government
to
object
to
the
completeness
of
the
record.
the
very
next
thing
that
happens
under
the
rules,
and
it's
rule
4(c),
is
the
secretary
has
90
days
to
set
out
all
of
her
objections
to
the
case.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i
think
that
you
have
to
back
up
and
acknowledge,
as
a
starting
point,
that
there's
no
question
that
congress
intended
this
program
to
award
fees
on
petitions
that
have
been
denied.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
petitions
are
routinely
denied
on
procedural
grounds
where
there
has
been
no
examination
of
the
underlying
merits,
just
as
the
government
contends
is
the
case
with
statute
of
limitations.
we
disagree
with
that.
we
think
actually
to
resolve
a
statute
of
limitations
question,
a
special
master
is
going
to
have
a
more
complete
understanding
of
the
underlying
merits
of
a
case
than
in
many
other
procedural
settings.
so
we
know
that
congress
has
already
said,
sure,
it's
a
streamlined
process,
but
we're
not
going
to
pursue
that
objective
at
the
expense
of
compensating
attorneys
who
bring
good
faith
claims
but
lose.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
the
--
the
--
i
think
that
the
best
answer
to
that
question
is
to
look
at
the
federal
circuit
--
circuit's
en
banc
ruling
in
cloer
i.
we
actually
argued
--
we
didn't
argue
snowstorm.
what
our
argument
was
is
there
was
an
extraordinary
circumstance
that
prevented
us
from
filing
within
36
months
of
the
first
symptom.
and
that
circumstance
was
there
was
no
scientific
evidence
of
--
of
a
link
between
the
vaccine--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--i
think
that
would
be
a
case-by-case
determination
as
to
whether
the
particular
facts
relied
upon
supported
good
faith
and
a
reasonable
basis.
i
think
in
your
honor's
hypothetical,
you
would
be
--
a
lawyer
would
be
skating
on
thin
ice
there,
too,
because
the
federal
circuit
made
clear
in
cloer
i
that
fraud
and
duress
are
the
grounds
for
equitable
tolling.
so
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
bring
a
claim
that
you
know
is
late
and
your
only
excuse
is
a
snowstorm,
you
have
to
look
at
cloer
i
and
think,
i
don't
have
a
very
strong
or
maybe
any
equitable
tolling
argument.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
they
--
well,
they
fought
the
issue.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
sure.
that's
the
law.
they
fought
the
issue
below
and
lost,
and
in
fairness,
in
their
briefs
to
this
court,
they
say,
we
don't
agree
with
the
ruling
just
because
we
didn't
seek
this
court's
review
for
reasons
that
are
not
identified.
that
is
the
law.
that's
correct.
and
it
is
frankly
one
in
a
long
list
of
inconsistencies
with
their
conception
of
what
it
means
to
file
under
the
act.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
my
understanding
from
reading
the
case
law
is
it's
the
latter.
it's
not
snowstorms.
it
is
here
is
a
disease.
i
have
a
child
that
has
been
sick
her
whole
life.
when
is
the
first
symptom
of
this
disease?
she
coughed
40
months
ago.
she
had
a
--
some
other
symptom
42,
and
the
experts
often
battle
that
out,
and
--
and
oftentimes
the
special
master
said,
sorry,
it
was
the
cough
at
40
months
that
is
the
first
symptom
of
the
disease,
not
the
symptom
you've
pointed
to.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i
can't
imagine
how
it
would
even
really
put
much
of
a
dent
in
that
government
obligation.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i
--
i
don't.
i
know
that
there
are
not
a
huge
number
of
published
cases
by
special
--
unpublished
decisions
by
special
masters
on
the
statute
of
limitations
question.
i
tend
to
think
that
those
numbers
will
actually
go
down
moving
forward,
even
under
the
rule
we're
proposing,
because
of
the
law
on
when
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
is
so
much
clearer
now
than
it
was
in
2005
when
we
brought
this
case.
the
other
point,
of
course,
is
you're
always
going
to
have
to
show
good
faith
and
a
reasonable
basis.
so
the
government
seems
to
suggest
that
the
rule
we're
advocating
and
the
one
that
the
federal
circuit
adopted
is
going
to
result
in
a
flood
of
frivolous
litigation.
i
think
that's
just
not
supported
because
of
the
requirements
you'd
have
to
establish.
i
think
there's
also
no
reason
to
think
that
that
will
be
the
case
empirically,
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason;
the
--
the
program
for
25
years
has
authorized
the
payment
of
fees
to
losers.
it
has
paid
out
$2.4
billion
in
compensation
to
individuals
injured
by
vaccines
in
that
25
years
and
just
about
$160
million
in
fees
for
winners
and
losers.
it
is
just
over
6
percent.
and
one
would
think
that
if
this
unusual
system
of
paying
losers
really
encouraged
the
filing
of
frivolous
lawsuits
so
lawyers
could
be
paid,
you'd
think
the
number
would
be
substantially
higher
than
6
percent.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
it
is.
i
do
want
to
answer
a
couple
of
the
questions
that
were
presented
during
my
friend's
presentation.
the
--
i
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
secretary
no
longer
discharges
her
obligation
to
publish
in
the
federal
register,
but
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
our
petition
was
published.
and
her
obligation
to
publish
it
was
triggered
by
the
statute's
requirement
that
a
petition
has,
quote,
“
been
filed
under
section
11
”.
ours
--
ours,
in
fact,
was
published.
the
question
that
--
that
you
raised,
justice
kagan,
is
there
any
other
situation
where
this
reading
results
in
a
petition
that
has
been
filed.
the
answer
is
yes,
the
government
argues
that
a
petition
filed
under
section
11,
even
if
it's
untimely,
is
sufficient
to
commence
proceedings
and
confer
jurisdiction,
which
if
that's
true,
it
goes
to
your
question,
justice
sotomayor.
how
do
you
get
here
if
the
statute
--
if
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
jurisdictional?
how
do
you
get
from
one
place
to
the
next?
i
--
i
think
there's
not
a
good
answer
for
that.
another
question
that
has
arisen,
i
think,
justice
scalia,
your
comments
are
correct,
that
--
that
a
filing,
a
judgment
can
occur
at
any
time
in
a
case.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
remember
that
the
secretary
is
not
bound
to
defend
a
case
on
the
merits
and
then
contest
a
fee
award
for
the
same
reason.
so
there
are
cases
pending
before
the
special
masters
right
now
that
for
reasons
i
suspect
are
that
the
secretary
wanted
to
establish
a
precedent,
that
there
is
no
causation
between
vaccine
a
and
injury
x,
we
want
to
litigate
that
on
the
merits,
and
they
have
won.
but
it
wasn't
a
slam
dunk.
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence
and
a
lot
of
science
to
contradict
that,
which
was
rejected.
those
lawyers
now
come
before
the
special
master
and
seek
fees
in
those
cases,
and
the
secretary
is
arguing
no
fees
because
these
are
time-barred.
and
in
that
case,
you
are
going
to
have
a
judgment,
by
the
government's
account,
entered
on
the
merits
and
then
they're
going
to
come
back
and
defend
a
fee
award
saying,
there
is
no
judgment
because
there's
never
been
a
case
filed,
and
you
can't
get
fees.
and
it
is
just
a
fundamental
and
glaring
inconsistency
with
their
position.
i
want
to
address
a
couple
additional
points
on
the
shadow
trial
argument,
because
these
were
raised
in
the
government's
reply
brief.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--right.
i
mean,
i
think
that
--
yes,
and
i
think
that,
in
terms
of
authority,
power,
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--i
think
that
you
probably
could.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
i
think
you
probably
could,
but
i
think
that
the
problem
is
you
would
then
be,
in
essence,
adopting
a
procedural
rule
though
that
endorses
the
inconsistency
in
the
position.
a
petition
is
filed
for
some
purposes
but
not
for
others,
even
though
congress
only
referred
to
petitions
filed
in
--
in
the
generic
sense.
it
didn't
distinguish
between
the
time
at
which
it's
entered
or
the
basis
on
which
it's
entered.
and
it
could
have
easily
done
these
things.
the
--
the
government
is
proposing
this
legal
fiction.
well,
they
say,
sure,
i
mean,
it
can
be
tendered
and
accepted
and
you
can
litigate
it
for
years
and
there
can
be
all
sorts
of
rulings,
but
as
soon
as
the
special
master
enters
a
ruling
on
timeliness,
the
phrase
is
they're
bound
to,
quote,
“
refuse
to
recognize
”
that
it
has
ever
been
filed.
they
could
have
established
that
--
congress
could
have
established
that
legal
fiction.
it
could
have
said
no
petition
shall
be
deemed
to
be
filed
if
it
is
brought
after
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
or
congress
could
have
achieved
this
same
consequence
that
the
government
is
attributing
to
section
16
by
enacting
a
rule
like
this
court's
rule
13-2;
the
court
will
not
--
will
not
file
a
cert
petition
that
is
untimely.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
yeah,
a
couple
--
a
couple
quick
points.
we
cited
11
cases
in
the
discussion
of
our
--
in
our
discussion
of
shadow
trials
for
the
point
that
these
petition
--
petitions
are
denied
on
procedural
grounds
all
the
time,
and
special
masters
resolve
subsequent
fee
requests
routinely
and
without
a
hearing.
the
government--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--inadequate
records
is
one
reason.
sometimes
a
petitioner
dies
and
their
family
or
estate
does
not
want
to
pursue
this,
so
it's
abandoned.
there's
cases
where
there's
just
a
failure
to
prosecute,
it's
not
clear
why;
the
lawyers
lost
touch
with
a
client
or
i
don't
know
the
reason
why,
it's
just
a
failure
to
prosecute.
there
are
also
cases
where
somebody
is
arguing
for
causation,
but
as
their
case
is
going
through
the
system,
other
cases
are
being
decided
that
reject
their
view,
particularly
paradigm
cases.
and
the
petitioners
fold,
they
give
up,
but
the
lawyers,
having
fought
the
cases
for
years,
come
in
and
argue.
so
those
are
all,
incidentally,
examples
of
procedural
denials
that
are
reflected
in
the
11
cases
we
cited.
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
the
government
doesn't
say
which
of
those
cases
it's
referring
to
when
it
makes
the
claim
that
our
cases
reflect
circumstances
where
the
secretary
has
determined
the
program's
resources
would
be
best
conserved
by,
i
think
the
phrase
is
“
acquiescing
”
to
a
modest
request
for
fees.
they
don't
identify
what
cases
they're
talking
about,
but
in
10
of
the
11
cases
we
cited,
on
their
face,
fee
awards
were
contested.
and
they're
litigated.
and
you
read
the
opinions,
and
the
special
masters
are
resolving
the
challenges
that
the
secretary
made,
and
they
are
doing
it
without
a
hearing.
there
also
is
this
argument
about
--
i
think
we've
already
gone
over
the
fact
that
a
statute
of
limitations
determination
is
not
identical
to
a
causation
determination.
the
additional
argument
that
the
secretary
made
in
their
brief
is
that,
unlike
many
other
matters
that
must
be
supported
at
the
outset
--
the
key
question
in
most
of
these
cases,
causation,
you
don't
have
to
furnish
evidence
or
make
allegations
of
causation
--
is
not
correct.
under
section
11(c),
if
you're
bringing
a
non-table
case,
you
have
to
allege
cause
and
effect.
and
if
the
medical
records
don't
support
causation,
you
need
an
affidavit
from
an
expert.
so
that
is
front-loaded
as
well.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
there
are
not.
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
for
rates?
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
it
varies
region
by
region.
i
think
the
special
masters
look
to
see
what
the
rates
in
denver
are
as
opposed
to
the
rates
in
new
york
or
los
angeles--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--right.
i
think
it's
less.
and
it's
not--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--right.
and
it's
not
cja
rates--
mr.
robert
t.
fishman
--but
very
often,
it's
not
the
rates
that
attorneys
are
actually
paid.
it
ends
up
being
a
problem
--
as
an
aside
--
with
expert
witnesses
sometimes,
because
the
special
masters
don't
pay
what
experts
in
these
cases
want.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
relinquish
the
remainder
of
my
time.
