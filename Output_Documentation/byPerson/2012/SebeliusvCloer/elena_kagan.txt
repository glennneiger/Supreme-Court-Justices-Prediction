justice
elena
kagan
mr.
horwich,
could
you
say
a
little
bit
more
about
the
reporting
to
congress
provision,
because
that
presumably
does
not
happen
at
the
very
beginning,
but
happens
more
at
the
end
or
in
the
middle.
so
do
--
does
the
department
subtract
the
number
of
untimely
petitions
from
the
number
that
it
reports?
justice
elena
kagan
all
actions
filed,
using
“
filed
”
in
the
normal
sense.
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
horwich,
before
you
go
to
the
consequences
argument,
just
to
keep
on
with
the
text
a
little
bit,
is
this
understanding
that
you
have
of
what
it
means
to
be
filed,
does
it
have
any
consequences
other
than
with
respect
to
attorneys'
fees,
or
is
that
the
only
thing
that
--
that
depends
on
viewing
the
word
“
filed
”
in
this
way?
justice
elena
kagan
do
you
think
it
would
be
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
or
special
master
to
look
at
a
case
and
say,
for
whatever
strange
reason,
this
is
a
case
where
it's
going
to
require
some
lengthy
mini-trial
in
order
to
figure
out
fees
and
that's
a
bad
use
of
everybody's
time,
so
i'm
not
going
to
grant
attorneys'
fees
here?
in
other
words,
you
know,
this
is
a
“
may
”
provision;
would
it
be
a
sufficient
reason
that
this
is
just
going
to
take
too
long,
it's
too
involved,
so
i'm
going
to
deny
attorneys'
fees
in
this
case?
justice
elena
kagan
mr.
fishman,
this
may
be
a
hard
question
for
you
to
answer,
but
is
your
sense
of
why
it
is
that
petitions
are
untimely
filed
that
they
usually
have
to
do
with
things
like,
you
know,
snowstorms
and
lawyer
error,
or
that
they
usually
have
to
do
with
questions
about
the
manifestation
of
symptoms?
or
something
else,
if
something
else
is
--
just
the
range
of
cases
out
there,
what
are
we
talking
about?
why
are
these
cases
untimely
filed?
