mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
vaccine
act
does
not
provide
for
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
on
a
petition
that
is
denied
as
untimely.
that's
the
best
reading
of
the
act's
text,
it
fits
best
with
the
structure
and
purposes
of
the
act,
and
it's
the
result
that's
consistent
with
the
canons
of
construction
that
would
apply
to
an
award
of
attorneys'
fees
out
of
the
federal
treasury.
now,
the
--
the
textual
question
here
in
some
sense
begins
with
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
is
in
section
16
the
act,
and
which
provides
that
no
petition
may
be
filed
outside
the
applicable
time
period.
now,
that
provision,
like
most
limitations
provisions,
doesn't
itself
actually
say
what
the
consequences
of
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
provision
are.
and
in
some
sense,
just
as
in
the
--
the
civil
context,
it's
not
as
if
the
special
master,
upon
finding
the
limitations
provision
hasn't
been
complied
with,
can
go
back
in
time
and
prevent
the
petition
from
being
filed,
just
as
a
civil
court
can't
prevent
an
action
from
being
commenced,
or
a
suit
from
being
brought,
or
whatever
the
limitations
provision
proscribes.
so
the
question
really
is
going
forward,
what
--
what
consequences
should
there
be
once
the
adjudicator
decides
--
once
he
or
the
special
master
decides
--
that
the
limitations
period
has
not
been
complied
with.
and
textually
speaking,
it's
the
correspondence
between
the
limitations
provision,
which
says
that
no
petition
may
be
filed,
and
the
attorneys'
fee
provision,
which
depends
on
the
existence
of
a
petition
filed,
that
signals
that
congress
intended
the
consequences
of
untimeliness
to
be
visited
through
the
application
of
the
attorneys'
fees
provision--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
those
provisions
would
--
those
provisions
by
their
terms
apply
at
points
in
the
proceedings
where
we
would
entirely
conventionally
accept
the
--
the
claimant's
representation
that
the
petition
has
been
filed
in
accordance
with
the
time
limitation.
that's
generally
true,
certainly
in
the
civil
context,
that
we
accept
the
plaintiff's
allegation.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
with
respect
to
--
with
respect
to
reporting
to
--
to
congress,
that's
actually
an
obligation
from
the
court
of
federal
claims,
so
i
can't
necessarily
speak
on
their
behalf
of
what
they
--
what
they've
produced.
from
what
i've
seen,
it's
a
statistical
report.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
the
federal
--
with
respect
to
the
federal
register
provision,
i
should
first
say
that
it
has
very
recently
come
to
my
office's
attention
that
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
has
not
been
complying
with
that
provision
for
the
last
few
years,
and
they
are
taking
steps
to
bring
themselves
in--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
it
--
they
--
they
have
historically,
and
let
me
--
up
till
about
2009
--
and
again,
to
be
clear,
they're
taking
steps
to
rectify
that
situation.
but
with
respect
to
the
period
up
to
2009,
what
they
would
do
--
and
this
is
understandable
given
the
provision
that
says
it's
supposed
to
be
published
within
--
and
i
believe
it's
30
days,
that
they
--
the
petitions
that
are
received
or
that
were
received
at
the
department
get
logged
into
a
computer
database,
and
then
a
report
gets
printed
out,
and
they
would
cross-check
them
for
accuracy
against
the
petition
title
and
forward
them
to
the
office
of
the
federal
register.
not
--
it
doesn't
--
it
wouldn't
make
sense
in
a
provision
that's
supposed
to
be
applied
essentially
upon
the
filing
of
the
petition,
to
go
into
an
examination
of
the
timeliness
of
that
--
of
that
petition.
and
so
we
think
that
provision,
just
as
you
would
--
just
as
you
would
describe
in
a
civil
context,
you
would
certainly
say
that
an
action
that
ultimately
proves
to
be
held
untimely
would
nonetheless
commence
if
--
for
example,
if
you
imagine
a
statute
of
limitations
that
says
no
action
may
be
commenced,
you
wouldn't
say
the
action
hadn't
been
commenced
at
the
time
it
was
pending.
and
--
and
that's
not
the
argument
we're
relying
on
here.
what
--
rather,
what
we're
relying
on
is
the
fact
that
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
case,
which
is
where
the
attorneys'
fee
provision
is
evidently
supposed
to
apply--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--i
believe
the
--
the
reporting
provision
is
a
--
there's
a
report
that
the
special
master
is
to
make
to
the
court
of
federal
claims,
and
there's
a
report
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
is
to
deliver
and
--
and
those,
from
what
i
have
seen
--
again,
the
executive
branch
doesn't
prepare
those,
because
it's
the
special
masters
and
the
court
that
do,
but
the
reports
that
i
have
seen,
my
understanding
is
that
the
report
of
the
special
master
is
delivered
orally
to
the
judges,
and
so
i
don't
actually
know
what
the
contents
of
that
are,
and
the
report
that
--
and
the
report
that
the
court
of
federal
claims
sends
to
congress
is
a
statistical
report
of
all
--
actually,
of
all
actions
filed
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
but
it
sends
a
kind
of
an
omnibus
report
in
satisfaction
of--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--no,
no.
i
actually
mean
all
actions
filed
meaning
vaccine
act
actions
and
otherwise.
so
it
--
it
actually
doesn't
even
differentiate
the
vaccine
act--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
think
it
means--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
i
don't
think
it
means
--
i
don't
think
it
means
different
things
in
the
act
so
much
as
it
means
it
--
it
is
to
be
applied
with
the
understand
--
it
is
to
be
applied
as
a
fair
stand
at
the
time
the
provision
is
applied.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
let
me
--
let
me
focus
for
a
moment
then
on
the
attorneys'
fee
provision,
though,
in
terms
of
why
--
why
that
is
particularly
good
reason
to
think
that
petitions
--
a
petition
filed
is
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
what
ought
to
have
been
done.
and
that's
because
the
--
the
attorneys'
fee
provision
speaks
as
of
--
it
speaks
of
awards
of
fees
at
the
time
of
judgment.
and
so
at
that
time,
we
know
that
any
limitations
issue
should
have
been
resolved
by
that
point
in
the
case.
and
therefore,
it
is
--
it
is
an
entirely
natural
--
it's
entirely
natural
to
expect
that
the
limitations
provision
might
therefore
have
some
consequences
at
that
stage.
in
some
ways,
you
can
think
of
it
as
an
application
of
the
old
maxim
that
equity
regards
as
done
what
ought
to
have
been
done.
so
we're
saying
to
the
special
master,
well,
if
you've
gotten
to
the
point
at
the
end
of
the
case
where
there's
a
judgment,
and
you've
determined
that
this
petition
was
forbidden
from
being
filed,
in
the
sense
that
the
limitations
provision
forbids
it,
then
you
should
visit
the
consequences
there.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
if
it
sounds
like
a
jurisdictional
argument,
then
i
suppose
the
answer
would
be
for
this
court
to
say
that
it's
jurisdictional,
and
of
course,
if
that's
true,
then
our
position
--
our
position
would
prevail.
we
think
on
balance,
given
this
court's
precedence
most
recently
in
the
--
the
auburn
regional
medical
center
case,
that
these
--
that
this
court
did
not
interpret
congress's
time
limit
provisions
to
be
endowed
with
jurisdictional
significance.
it
doesn't
mean
that
it
doesn't
have
any
significance.
it
has
the
significance
of
an
ordinary
affirmative
defense,
just
as
it
has
the
significance
of
the
--
the
timeliness
provision
here
just
has
the
significance
of
an
ordinary
affirmative
defense
just
as--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
what
i
was
saying
--
what
i
was
saying
in
response
to
justice
sotomayor's
question
is
that
if
--
if
it
seems
that
that
argument
compels
you
to
believe
that
it's
jurisdictional,
then
the
court
should
reach
the
conclusion
that
it's
jurisdictional
rather
than--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--we
think
--
we
think
that
it
is
not.
we
think
that
it
is
not,
even
if
the
text
of
it
makes
it
sound
like
it
could
have
jurisdictional
significance,
we
think
on
balance,
this
court's
precedents
teach
that
time
--
that
time
limits
are
typically
claim
processing
rules,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
text
overcomes
that
view.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
it
seems
to
--
there
is
not
anything
in
the
compensation
provision
that
says
that
it's
an
affirmative
defense
any
more
than
--
in
any
way
that's
more
explicit
than
what
we're
relying
on
to
say
that
it's
an
affirmative
defense
to
attorneys'
fees.
it's
not
as
if
congress
said
in
another
section
there
shall
be
no
award
of
future
medical
expenses
when
the
statute
of
limitations
is
not
complied
with,
and
it
left
that
out
of
the
attorneys'
fees.
that's
not
how
the
statute
is
structured.
so
we're
in
a
situation
where
i
think
we
ordinarily
are
with
statutes
of
limitation,
in
trying
to
decide
what
the
consequences
of
noncompliance
are--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--it
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
appropriate
disposition
of
a
case
that
is
held
to
be
untimely
is
that
there
is
a
judgment
denying
compensation.
and
the
reasons
for
that
have
to
do
with
something
that's
not
really
briefed,
but
the
operation
of
the
appellate
provisions
of
the
act
become
confusing
if
you
treat
a
dismissal
as
something
different.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
we
think
--
we
agree
that
it's
a
judgment,
but
it
--
but
it
has
to
be
a
judgment
--
i'm
looking
here
at
page
26a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
--
refers
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
federal
claims
on
such
a
petition.
and
then
such
a
petition
refers
back
to
a
petition
filed--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--and
so
that's--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well
--
i
--
but
i
do
think
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--it's
still
a
judgment,
but
it
is
--
it
is
not
a
judgment
in
connection
with
a
petition
that
should
be
regarded
as
having
been
filed
timely--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--that
is
our
first
argument.
but
let
me
say,
it
is
also
--
the
--
the
situation
here
is
not
one
in
which
we
think
that
it's
incumbent
on
the
government
to
--
to
demonstrate
clearly
how
congress
wanted
to
withhold
attorneys'
fees.
the
canons
of
construction
here
all
caution
the
court
to
be
--
to
be
extremely
reluctant
to
extend
or
--
or
find
that
congress
is
willing
to
pays
attorneys'
fees
in
--
in
this
context.
and
that's
for
--
and
that's
for
several
reasons.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
it's
clear
that
there's
a
waiver,
but
it's--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
i
think
this
court's
decision
certainly
most
recently
in
the
cooper
case
from
a
term
or
two
ago
says
that
--
that
this
court
considers
not
only
the
existence
but
the
extent
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
to
be
controlled
by
--
by
canons
that
--
that
counsel
against
extending
--
extending
that
waiver.
but
that's
not
the
only
issue
here.
because
the
consequences
of
--
of
respondent's
rule
are
ones
that
--
that
are
entirely
out
of
place
both
with
fee
proceedings
in
general
and
with
this
compensation
program
in
particular.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think
viewing
the
word
“
filed
”
in
this
way
also
explains
mechanically
why
the
limitations
issue
becomes
an
affirmative
defense
on
the
merits
as
well,
because
section
13
says
compensation
has
to
be
awarded
on
a
record,
and
the
record
is
defined
as
the
record
on
a
petition
filed.
so
similarly,
if
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
case
or
you
get
to
the
point
of
limitations
determination,
the
court
says,
well,
there
shouldn't
--
there
shouldn't
be
--
there
should
not
have
been
a
petition
here,
and
so
regarding
--
regarding
is
done
what
should
have
been
done,
we'll
say
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
record
available
on
that
petition,
so
we
should
deny
compensation.
so
i
agree
it's
a
little
--
which
i
concede
is
--
is
not
how
we
ordinarily
think
about
statutes
of
limitation,
but
it
--
but
it
certainly
is
that
--
it
is
exactly
the
same
textual
logic
in
the--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--sure.
i'm
happy
to
step
through
it
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
sure.
so
section
13
of
the
act,
which
starts
on
page
19a
of
the
government's
brief
says
that
compensation
is
awarded
"if
the
special
master
report
finds
on
the
record.
"
various
matters.
but
then
it
goes
on,
and
this
is
on
page
21a
in
section
13(c)
to
define
the
record
as
the
--
as
the
record
established
on
a
petition
filed.
and
so
in
the
same
sense
that
if
the
special
master
determines
that
the
limitations
provision
says,
well,
there
shouldn't
have
been
a
petition
filed,
the
consequence
is
there
is
not
a
basis
for
attorneys'
fees.
they're
similarly
in
this
definitional
provision
not
a
basis
for
the
record
on
which
compensation
is
to
be
awarded
on
the
merits.
and
that
produces
the
result
that
we
would
expect,
which
is
that--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--what
i'm
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
the
limitation
--
when
it's
determined
that
the
limitations
provision
applies
and
should
have
prevented
the
filing
of
the
petition,
and
the
special
master
has
to
decide,
well,
what
are
the
consequences
of
that.
because,
again,
the
special
master
can't
go
back
and
actually
prevent
the
whole
thing
from
having
happened,
but
the
special
master
can
say,
well,
if
this
direct
--
if
this
directed
that
there
shouldn't
have
been
a
petition
filed,
then
one
of
the
consequences
is
there's
no
--
there's
no
record
on
which
we
should
be
able
to
decide
compensation.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
there's
several
reasons.
the
first
--
the
first
one
is
that
in
your
--
in
your
first
example
where
there's
been
a
determination
on
the
merits,
the
special
master
is
in
a
perfect
situation
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
on
the
merits.
and
this
is
how
--
this
is
how
the
program
has
worked
since
its
existence,
because
to
be
clear,
until
the
decision
below,
there
was
no
practice
of
awarding
attorneys'
fees
on
untimely
petitions
in
the
--
in
the
program.
and
so
what
you
would
get
would
be
situations
like
your
first
example,
justice
alito,
where
the
special
master
would
issue
a
--
a
written
decision
on
entitlement
and
these
are
--
these
are
10,
15,
20,
25
pages
long
in
my
experience,
dealing
in
considerable
detail
with
the
medical
evidence,
the
scientific
evidence,
the
expert
testimony,
the
review
of
literature,
the
different
theories
of
causation,
and
getting
to
the
end,
and
obviously,
if
a
decision
is
that
compensation
is
to
be
awarded,
then
attorneys'
fees
follow
as
a
matter
of
right,
but
if
compensation
is
denied,
the
special
master
can
and
typically
does
add
literally
as
an
afterthought
that
--
but
having
been
through
all
of
this
and
having
discussed
all
of
this,
i
think
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
what
was
being
argued
here.
now,
in
your
second
example
where
the
special
master
has
only
determined
this
essentially
diagnostic
question
of
when
was
the
first
symptom
of
this
particular
claimant's
particular
injury,
the
special
master
hasn't
looked
at
any
materials
about
whether
the
vaccine
can
cause
that
injury.
so
let
me
give
as
a
--
as
a
paradigm
example
maybe
the
--
what
we
give
in
our
brief
as
the
--
the
smith
case
which
had
to
do
with
the
claim
of
whether
certain
childhood
vaccines
caused
the
claimant's
type
1
diabetes.
and
the
special
master's
decision
focuses
on
the
question
of
whether
the
first
symptom
of
the
diabetes
was
a
blood
glucose
reading
that
sent
the
claimant
to
the
hospital,
and
then--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
the
question
under
the
attorneys'
fee
provision,
and
this
is
on
26(a)
of
the
government's
brief,
is
a
determination
that
the
petition
was
brought
in
good
faith
and
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
claim
for
which
the
petition
was
brought.
the
question
isn't
was
there
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
it
was
timely,
the
question
is
--
and
--
and
i
think
my
friend
agrees
with
me
on
this--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
what
--
what
we're
worried
about
here
is
--
is
not
the
fact
that
some
fees
may
be
paid.
what
--
what
we're
worried
about
here,
as
you
said,
are
the
shadow
trials,
and
--
and
to
an
extent
also
the
question
of
whether
additional
cases
would
be
attractive
to
the
program.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
but
--
but
--
but,
your
honor,
i
think
where
we're
coming
--
where
we're
coming
at
this
from
is
--
is
saying
what
did
congress
envision
here.
and
as
this
court
said
in
hensley
and
in
pierce,
congress
doesn't
want
attorneys'
fees
to
be
a
second
major
litigation.
so
it
seems
exceedingly
odd
to
think
it
would
have
set
up
a
scheme
in
which
the
case
would
end
on
the
merits
and
yet,
the
question
on
which
attorneys'
fees
are
to
be
decided
--
the
availability
of
attorneys'
fees
is
to
be
decided
is
going
to
require
some
further
proceedings
that
have
not--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
right.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
yes.
maybe
if
i
finish
giving
the
example
i
was
giving
in
response
to
the
--
the
second
part
of
justice
alito's
dichotomy
in
that
smith
case.
so,
the
timeliness
question
the
special
master
resolved
was,
okay,
was
it
the
blood
glucose
reading
that
was
within
the
limitations
period
that
was
the
first
symptom
or
was
it
the
excessive
thirst
and
frequent
urination
that
fell
outside
the
limitations
period.
now,
the
special
master,
having
resolved
that,
which
is
something
that
i
think
perhaps
even
some
of
us
in
the
room
could
recognize
that
one
of
those
was
the
symptom
--
was
likely
the
first
symptom
or
not,
the
special
master
then
has
to
decide,
was
there
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
claim
that
childhood
vaccines
caused
type
1
diabetes?
and
that's
simply
not
something
that
that
timeliness
determination
is
going
to
be
any
good
for
the
special
master
in
deciding.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
i
think
part
of
the
problem
is
that
we
would
be
asking
the
special
master
to
spend
the
special
master's
time
reviewing
that
material,
assuming
that
it's
even
in
the
petition,
which
is
not
always
the
case.
we'd
be
asking
the
special
master
to
spend
--
spend
her
time
evaluating
that
material
in
a
proceeding
that
can't
result
in
compensation
to
any
injured
person,
which
is,
of
course,
the
point
of
the
program,
instead
of
spending
her
time
on
--
on
other
petitions,
and
it's
that
diversion
of
resources
that's
so
concerning
to
us
and
we
think
would
have
been
so
peculiar
to
congress.
if
i
could
reserve
my--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
thank
you.
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
no,
we
don't.
and
actually,
that's
the
point
i
wanted
to
start
with
is
that
--
is
that
the
federal
circuit's
decision
below
puts
the
program
into
this
unchartered
territory,
where
we
don't
really
know
what
this
is
going
to
look
like.
the
cases
that
--
that
my
friend
cites
in
his
brief
are
ones
that
either
the
petition
is
so
facially
defective
that,
of
course,
fees
can't
be
awarded
on
it,
but
there's
no
reason
to
think
that's
going
to
be
the
typical
case.
and
then
there's
other
cases
where
the
application
of
the
reasonable
basis
standard
is
so
lax
as
to
essentially
just
turn
on
--
on
the
claimant's
personal
say-so,
that,
oh,
i
think
the
vaccine
caused
my
injury.
that's
like
--
that's
the
hamrick
case,
for
example;
it's
cited
in
there.
and
that
--
that
can't
be
the
standard
for
reasonable
basis.
and
--
and
so
i
think
the
court
needs
to
keep
in
mind
that,
for
example,
when
my
friend
says
there's
--
the
government
doesn't
cite
a
case
where
there's
been
any
shadow
trial,
the
reason
is
because
there
haven't
been
fees
available
on
untimely
petitions,
which
is
exactly
the
set-up
that
would
cause
you
to
have
a
shadow
trial.
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
well,
there
aren't
--
there
are
not
really
other
procedural
grounds.
there
may
be
situations
where
a
petition
is
voluntarily
withdrawn,
and
i
think
there
is
a
problem
there
about
there
not
actually
being
a
judgment
when
somebody
voluntarily
withdraws.
but
even
in
those,
the
special
masters
should
have,
in
our
view,
examined
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
basis.
i
don't
think
it's
right
to
say
that
an
attorney
can
come
in,
file
the
petition
and
then
the
claimant
decides,
well,
i
would
like
to
withdraw,
and
then
the
attorney
essentially
gets
paid
as
of
right.
so
our
--
it's
unsurprising
that
there's
no
examples
of
these
hearings.
it's
also
unsurprising
that
my
friend
says,
well,
there
--
for
the
petitions,
when
it
comes
time
to
determine
fees,
the
record
is
complete.
of
course
the
record
is
complete,
because
the
case
has
been
decided
on
the
merits.
and
that's
the
paradigm
situation
under
which
the
program
has
been
operated.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
entering
this
unchartered
territory,
where
--
where
the
program
has
not
been
before,
and
where
you
wouldn't
think
congress
would
want
to
send
it.
and
this
is
our
central
concern
with
this
case.
the
government's
concern
here
--
and
the
reason
we've
petitioned
for
certiorari
is
not
because
of
the
dollar
amount
involved
in
paying
these
claims.
the
concern
is
about
where
the
program's
resources
are
being
directed.
the
question
is
--
the
question
is
about
where
the
finite
number
of
special
masters,
the
finite
number
of
government
attorneys,
can
put
their
time
in
responding
to
these
petitions
for
--
to
deliver
the
compensation
to
the
very
few
but
very
deserving
people
who
congress
wanted
to
award
compensation
to.
and
our
concern
here
is--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
in
the
case
of--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
no.
in
the
case
where
the
claimant
dies,
the
statute
has
provisions
for
that,
and
you
can
obtain
compensation
in
that
situation.
so
there's
no
reason
an
attorney
can't
go
on
there--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--if
they
want
to
--
if
they
want
to
withdraw
the
petition,
i
guess
it
depends
on
exactly
the
circumstances
under
which--
mr.
benjamin
j.
horwich
--well,
my
view
--
my
view
is
the
view
that
i
think
we
would
take
under
any
fee
shifting
provision,
which
is
that
if
a
claimant
wants
to
withdraw
his
or
her
case,
i
don't
think
that
he
can
then
claim
the
benefit
of
the
attorneys'
fee
provision,
absent
some
circumstances
that
--
that
would
warrant
the
finding
of
reasonable
basis.
i
think
that
is
an
unexceptional
result.
thank
you.
