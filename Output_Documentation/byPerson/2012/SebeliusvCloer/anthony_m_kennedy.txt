but
is
--
is
the
upshot
of
your
argument
then
that
filing
means
different
things
under
different
provisions
of
the
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
that's
so,
it
tends
to
weaken
the
force
of
your
reliance
on
--
on
filing
in
the
statute
--
on
the
word
“
filing
”
in
the
statute
of
limitations
section.
justice
anthony
m.

well,
i
meant
--
i
meant
that
just
to
supplement
justice
kagan's
question.
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
it
off.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
shadow
trial
brings
up
the
answer
that
you
were
giving
to
the
second
part
of
justice
alito's
question,
which
you
never
got
to
finish.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
were
saying
--
you
were
giving
the
example,
suppose
this
were
a
question
of
timeliness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
when
did
the
fact
of
the
vaccine
first
--
or
the
symptoms
first
become
manifest,
and
you
were
--
and
you
said
that
this
should
not
be
tried
because
--
and
this
is
finishing
off
justice--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--justice
alito's
dichotomy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
very
fact
that
it's
streamlined
indicates
to
me
that
we
should
be
very
careful
to
enforce
the
policy
of
the
rule
which
is
to
deter
the
filing
of
stale
claims.
and
your
--
your
rule
certainly
undermines
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
does
seem
to
me,
i
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
ask
the
government
this
question,
that
the
equitable
tolling
argument
undercuts
the
government's
position
that
no
petition
may
be
filed,
as
being
an
absolute.
because
we
all
know,
i
take
it
the
government
concedes,
that
there
is
equitable
tolling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
there
can
be
equitable
tolling
in
some
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
were
going
to
address
the
shadow
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
procedural
grounds
because
the
affidavits
aren't
sufficient
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--are
there
regulations
or
rules
establishing
hourly
rates?
