chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
case
12-236,
sebelius
v.
cloer.
mr.
horwich.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
heard
you
right.
you
said
if
it
sounds
jurisdictional,
we
should
say
it
is,
and
you
win.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
your
conclusion
is
that
it
is
not
jurisdictional.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
fishman?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
if
--
if
you're
preparing
one
of
these
filings,
and
you're
all
set
to
go,
and
on
the
day
before
your
filing
you
say,
oh,
gosh,
it
doesn't
look
like
we're
going
to
be
on
time.
you
should
still
go
ahead
and
file,
because
you
might
be
able
to
apply
for
attorneys'
fees.
while
if
you
file
it
the
day
that
it's
due
and
you
find
out
the
day
after,
oh,
my
gosh,
we
weren't
on
time,
then
there's
no
question
that
you
could
apply
for
attorneys'
fees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
hypothetical
was
not
that
you
had
two
days
and
you
made
it
in
time,
but
that
before
the
--
the
time
--
after
the
time
expired
or
you
were
ready
to
file
on
time,
but
then
you
decided
on
further
research,
oh,
this
isn't
going
to
look
like
we're
going
to
comply.
we
thought
we
had
the
time,
but
we
don't.
you
should
still
go
ahead
and
file,
right,
so
that
you
might
be
able
to
get
the
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
a
tough
position,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
if
you
have
got
a
difficult
and
tough
and
complicated
case,
well,
you
get
no
fees;
but
if
you've
got
an
easy
one,
well,
then
you
get
fees.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
thought
you
were
--
i
thought
you
were
giving
us
that
argument
when
you
said
under
the
fees
all
you
need
is
reasonable
and
good
faith.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
so
is
one
reason
that
should
affect
the
exercise
of
discretion
is
that
you
didn't
comply
with
the
statute
of
limitations?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
is
the
--
what's
the
relationship
between
your
position
and
equitable
tolling?
i
mean,
your
case,
i
think,
is
unusual
in
that
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
confusion
about
when
the
statute
of
limitations
might
run;
that's
your
position.
i
would
think
a
lot
of
the
cases
where
the
attorney
doesn't
meet
the
limitations
deadline
will
involve
things
like,
you
know,
i
was
delayed
by
hurricane
sandy
or
--
or
whatever,
or
we
were
trying
to
file,
it
got
lost
in
the
mail.
are
those
things
that
--
i
mean,
should
that
be
considered
under
the
rubric
of
equitable
tolling,
or
under
--
under
your
idea
where
you
don't
have
to
file
on
time
anyway?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
i
would
assume
the
more
typical
case
is
when
you
miss
a
filing
deadline
is
because
the
lawyer,
whether
for
good
reasons
or
bad,
missed
the
filing
deadline.
and
i'm
just
curious
if
you
would
--
if
it's
not
sufficient
to
support
equitable
tolling,
whether
it
is,
therefore,
unreasonable
when
it
comes
to
attorneys'
fees?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
mr.
horwich,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
justice
sotomayor
has
our
opinion
this
morning
in
case
12-236,
sebelius
versus
cloer,
which
i
will
read
for
her
in
her
absence.
this
case
concerns
whether
attorney's
fees
maybe
awarded
on
an
untimely
petition
for
compensation
under
the
national
childhood
vaccine
injury
act,
what
we
call
the
ncvia.
if
the
petition
was
brought
in
good
faith
and
with
a
reasonable
basis,
the
ncvia
establishes
a
no-fault
compensation
program
for
those
injured
by
a
vaccine.
parties
who
seek
compensation
under
the
ncvia
must
file
a
petition
including
specified
medical
documentation
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
federal
claims.
this
petition
is
then
adjudicated
by
a
special
master
who
determines
among
other
things
whether
the
petition
was
filed
within
the
ncvia's
36-month
limitations
period
and
whether
compensation
should
be
paid
out.
while
attorneys
who
provide
services
in
connection
with
the
petition
may
not
charge
a
fee
for
their
work,
the
ncvia
provides
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
for
successful
petitions
and
for
those
unsuccessful
petitions
brought
in
good
faith
and
with
a
reasonable
basis.
in
1997,
after
receiving
her
third
hepatitis
b
vaccine,
respondent
melissa
cloer
began
to
experience
symptoms
that
eventually
lead
to
a
multiple
sclerosis
diagnosis
in
2003.
she
filed
a
claim
for
compensation
under
the
ncvia
in
2005
after
she
learned
of
a
link
between
hepatitis
b
vaccine
and
multiple
sclerosis.
the
special
master
assigned
to
her
petition
determined
that
it
was
untimely
for
appeal.
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
agreed
that
cloer's
petition
was
untimely.
cloer
then
moved
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees.
the
government
opposed
her
motion.
the
en
banc
federal
circuit
agreed
with
cloer
that
even
though
her
petition
was
untimely,
it
could
qualify
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
if
it
was
brought
in
good
faith
and
with
a
reasonable
basis.
we
granted
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
and
now
affirm.
the
ncvia's
fees
provision
ties
eligibility
for
an
award
for
attorney's
fees
to
a
proceeding
on
“a
petition
filed
under
section
300
aa-11
of
title
xlii
of
the
united
states
code.
and
for
its
part,
section
300
aa-11
requires
that
a
petition
be
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
commence
a
proceeding
for
compensation.
nothing
in
either
section
suggests
that
the
reason
for
the
subsequent
dismissal
of
a
petition,
such
as
untimeliness,
nullifies
the
initial
filing.
as
the
term
filed
is
commonly
understood,
an
application
is
filed
when
it
is
delivered
to
and
accepted
by
the
appropriate
court
officer
for
placement
into
the
official
record.
so,
once
an
ncvia
petition
is
delivered
and
accepted
by
the
clerk
of
the
court,
it
is
filed
for
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
eligible
for
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
even
if
untimely
so
long
as
it
was
brought
in
good
faith
and
with
a
reasonable
basis.
the
government's
contrary
argument
that
the
ncvia's
36-month
limitations
period
is
a
statutory
prerequisite
to
the
filing
of
a
petition
lacks
textual
support.
neither
section
§300aa-11
nor
the
fees
provision
references
this
limitations
provision.
and
in
order
to
adopt
the
government's
argument,
we
would
have
to
conclude
that
a
petition
filed
out
of
time
is
a
petition
that
was
never
filed
at
all.
such
a
result
is
contrary
to
the
common
understanding
of
the
term
filed
and
the
text
of
the
ncvia
itself.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
have
joined
the
opinion
as
to
all
but
part
ii-b.
