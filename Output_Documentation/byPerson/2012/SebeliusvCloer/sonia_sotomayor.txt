mr.
horwich--
justice
sonia
sotomayor
--that
sounds
like
a
jurisdictional
argument
to
me.
but
i
understand
the
government
to
be
conceding
that
this
statute
of
limitations
is
not
jurisdictional.
it's
just
a
claim
processing
item.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
totally
lost
that
answer.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
could
you
--
could
you
go
back
and
talk
to
me
again
about
what
you
mean
about
not
having
a
record?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i'm
totally
confused.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
record
shouldn't
be
filed
in
that
case
or
that
the
record
supports
the
conclusion
that
it
was
untimely?
or
neither?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
excuse
me.
could
you
--
could
you
--
there
seems
to
be
a
confusion
in
this
consequence
conversation.
you
seem
to
be
assuming
that
the
attorneys'
fee
award
on
good
faith
basis
has
to
do
with
the
ultimate
merits,
did
the
vaccine
cause
this
injury.
i
would
have
assumed
that
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
has
to
do
with
whether
the
petition
was
brought
in
good
faith;
i.e.,
was
there
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
the
petition
was
timely.
and
on
that
issue,
before
the
court
can
adjudicate
the
timeliness
question,
it
has
to
know
all
of
the
facts
that
made
the
petitioner
believe
it
was
timely.
and
so
i'm
a
little
bit
confused
as
to
what
additional
factfinding
the
court
has
to
do.
it
has
to
be
told
by
a
lawyer,
your
cases
say
because
reasonable
basis
has
to
be
in
fact
and
law.
the
law
says
first
symptom.
she
experienced
x,
y,
and
z,
and
we
thought
the
latter
was
the
starting
point
of
the
statute,
not
the
former.
what
more
does
the
special
master
need
to
know
to
adjudicate
whether
that's
in
good
faith,
that
belief
is
in
good
faith?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
now,
i
understand.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
how
do
you
answer
the
argument
about
a
shadow
trial?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
were
the
records
accumulated
and
when?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
how
were
the
records
accumulated
and
when?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
so
is
your
bottom
line
that
the
record
is
already
there
for
the
shadow
determination?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
they
are
arguing
that
they
don't
need
to,
and
why
should
be
--
why
should
they
be
put
to
the
burden
of
doing
that.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
any
idea
from
the
cases
what
the
ranges
are?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
for
rates.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
i
know
that
civil
rights
rates,
for
example,
are
far
below
market
rates
for
most
law
firms.
is
that
the
same
for
this,
or
is
it
market
rates
generally?
justice
sonia
sotomayor
market
rates
for
general
litigation.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
right.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
do
you
have
some
evidence
--
numbers
--
to
tell
us
how
complicated
the
fee
award
disputes
are
generally
--
putting
aside,
because
it
hasn't
until
recently
been
an
issue
for
cases
dismissed
--
but
for
other
cases,
particularly
those
dismissed
on
--
other
procedural
grounds.
justice
sonia
sotomayor
but
there
have
been
dismissals
on
other
procedural
grounds.
