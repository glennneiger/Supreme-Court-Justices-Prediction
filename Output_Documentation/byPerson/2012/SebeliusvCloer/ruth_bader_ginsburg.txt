there
are
other
--
there
are
other
provisions
that
refer
to
a
petition
filed.
for
example,
reporting
annually
to
congress,
publishing
a
notice
in
the
federal
register,
those
both
refer
to
any
petition
filed.
and
so
in
those
sections
at
least,
petition
filed
would
assume
petition
filed
after
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
don't
you
--
don't
you
put
in
the
federal
register
and
report
to
congress
petitions
that
had
been
filed
out
of
time?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
think
about
the
federal
register.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
they
don't
file
anything
in
the
federal
register.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
using
federal
rules
as
your
model,
and
federal
rules
list
statute
of
limitations
as
an
affirmative
defense.
ordinarily,
that's
what
it
is.
but
is
it
an
affirmative
--
well,
certainly
it's
an
affirmative
defense
to
any
award
of
compensation
under
the
vaccine
act.
but
what
makes
it
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
award
of
fees?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
there's
a
lot
of
information
just
in
11
--
what
is
it
--
(c),
tells
what
has
to
be
put
in
the
petition.
and
there's
--
couldn't
--
couldn't
a
special
master
make
the
determination
based
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
are
you
saying
that
the
good
faith
and
the
reasonableness
go
to
two
things:
one,
the
claim
on
the
merits,
and
also
the
timeliness.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
think
the
special
master
“
may
”
award
--
so
it
“
may
”
award
is
discretionary.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
--
let's
take
this
case.
what
would
you
put
in
to
show
that
you
have
been
reasonable,
in
good
faith
and
reasonable,
one,
as
to
the
claim;
and
two,
as
to
the
attorneys'
fees?
what
--
what
would
the
special
master
have
to
look
at
to
make
those
determinations
in
this
case?
