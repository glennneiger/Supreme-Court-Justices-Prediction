justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
now,
look,
still,
the
worst
thing,
the
obvious
question
--
i
mean,
as
a
textual
matter,
but
i
don't
know
how
you
reconcile
your
position
with
the
--
with
the
first
words
in
300aa-11,
which
is
talking
about
a
petition
starts
this
whole
proceeding
and
you
want
to
interpret
that
word
“
petition
”
meaning
a
timely
petition.
you
mean
an
untimely
petition
doesn't
start
the
proceeding?
i
mean,
that's
the
technical
linguistic
thing,
but
if
you
get
to
your
--
to
your
basic
worrying
you,
what
is
worrying
you
is
this
proceeding,
okay?
that's
what's
worrying
you,
i
think,
the
shadow
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
on
that,
justice
sotomayor
said,
you
only
get
into
this
problem
when
the
attorney
has
filed
this
timeliness
matter
with
a
good
reason
to
think
his
petition
is
timely,
otherwise
forget
it.
okay?
so
you
look
at
the
complaint.
you
see
a
complaint
there.
he
had
a
good
reason
for
thinking
it's
timely.
it
looks,
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
as
if
his
client
has
a
good
claim,
a
plausible
one.
now,
if
the
government
wants
to
say,
we
want
to
present
some
evidence,
let
them
do
it.
and
if
they
don't,
the
worst
that
happens
is
this
person
who
thought
she
had
a
good
claim,
and
who
was
reasonable
in
her
timeliness
will
get
some
attorneys'
fees
paid.
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
so
terrible?
why
is
that
putting
such
a
burden
on
the
government
that
they
have
to
go
through
hoops,
i
think,
to
try
to
get
these
words
in
the
statute,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
in
your
control,
the
shadow
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
have
a
shadow
trial
if
you
don't
want
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
view
here
it's
the
same.
no
attorneys'
fees
when
the
client
dies,
or
they
decide
to
withdraw
the
petition
when
it's
dismissed
early
on
for
a
procedural
ground,
when
the
record
is
inadequate,
et
cetera.
you
think
that
in
none
of
those
cases
congress
would
have
wanted
attorneys'
fees.
or
is
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
think
in
some
but
not
others?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
my
question
is
what
is
your
view?
it's
the
same
problem.
he's
listed,
you
heard,
he
listed
six
or
seven
different
instances
--
four
or
five
anyway;
he's
found
11
cases,
apparently.
and
so
what
is
your
view?
