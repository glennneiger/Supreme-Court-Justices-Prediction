justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
well,
as
to
the
consequences,
let
me
give
you
these
two
cases.
the
first
is
the
case
in
which
the
petition
is
timely
filed
and
--
as
you
see
it,
but
the
claimant
does
not
prevail
because
the
claimant
is
unable
to
prove
that
the
injury
was
caused
by
the
vaccine,
but
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
argument
and
the
argument
was
made
in
good
faith,
so
there
would
be
eligibility
for
attorneys'
fees.
the
second
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
question
about
when
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run.
and
one
of
the
points
at
which
it
can
begin
to
run
is
when
there
is
the
onset
of
significant
aggravation
of
an
injury,
which
seems
like
a
question
about
which
there
could
be
a
factual
dispute.
and
in
that
situation
as
well,
the
claimant
does
not
prevail
on
the
statute
of
limitations
argument,
but
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
thinking
that
the
petition
was
submitted
within
the
period
after
the
--
the
onset
of
this
significant
aggravation.
why
would
congress
want
to
draw
a
line
between
--
a
distinction
between
those
two
situations
for
the
purpose
of
attorneys'
fees?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
and
if
there
is
a
hearing,
would
the
claimant's
attorney
get
--
potentially
get
attorneys'
fees
for
the
representation
at
the
hearing
about
attorneys'
fees?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
this
may
be
a
question
that
the
government
is
in
a
better
position
to
answer,
but
do
--
do
you
have
any
sense
of
how
often
claims
are
rejected
on
the
ground
of
timeliness,
what
we're
dealing
with?
i
mean,
you
mentioned
in
a
footnote
that
the
fund
out
of
which
the
--
the
claims
and
the
attorneys'
fees
are
paid
has
a
positive
balance
of
$3.5
billion.
maybe
the
only
government
fund
that
has
a
positive
balance,
but--
[laughter]
is
this
going
to
bankrupt
the
--
the
system?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
do
you
know
how
many
cases
we
might
be
dealing
with?
justice
samuel
a.
alito,
jr.
who
pays
for
the
special
masters?
is
that
paid
out
of
the
fund?
