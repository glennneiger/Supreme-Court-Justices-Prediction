justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
one
of
--
one
of
your
--
your
argument
you
were
making
is
that
there
--
since
the
attorneys'
fees
provision
looks
to
the
end
of
the
case,
it
should
not
be
construed
to
apply
to
the
--
the
failure
to
meet
the
filing
deadline.
is
--
is
that
true?
i
mean,
the
statute
says
if
the
judgment
does
not
award
compensation
--
on
a
petition
filed
under
section
300aa-11
--
if
the
judgment
does
--
is
there
no
judgment
when
a
--
when
a
case
is
dismissed
for
failure
to
meet
the
statute
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
other
than
the
judgment.
okay.
so
then
--
then
your
argument
that
--
that
this
fee
provision
looks
to
the
end
of
the
case
simply
doesn't
fly.
it
looks
to
the
beginning
as
well,
if
indeed
dismissal
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
time
limit
is
a
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
that's
just
repeating
your
--
your
first
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
petition
means
--
means
a
petition
properly
filed;
but
i
don't
see
that
the
--
that
the
statutory
scheme,
the
provision
that's
at
issue
here,
the
provision
for
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
looks
to
the
end
of
the
case
and
not
to
the
beginning.
it
looks
to
the
judgment.
and
if
it's
a
judgment
that
dismisses
because
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
statute,
it's
still
a
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
first
argument.
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
congress
has
waived
sovereign
immunity.
it's
absolutely
clear
that
there's
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
once
we
find
that,
i
don't
think
we
nit-pick
the
following
language
to
unrealistically
narrow
it
as
much
as
possible.
i
mean,
the
initial
question
of
whether
congress
has
agreed
to
be
sued
is,
yes,
we
--
we
assume
it
hasn't
and
--
and
--
but
--
but
once
it's
clear
that
it
has
agreed
to
be
sued,
i
think
we
just
interpret
the
language
reasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
--
i
have
been
thinking
about
your
last
point.
couldn't
that
last
point
easily
be
remedied
by
--
by
simply
our
holding
that,
you
know,
you
--
you
can't
ride
both
horses;
that
if,
in
fact,
you've
litigated
it
through
to
a
--
to
a
merits
judgment
in
your
favor,
which
presumably
has
stare
decisis
effect,
you
then
cannot
come
back
and
say
the
suit
never
occurred
because
the
filing
was
too
late.
i
mean,
we
--
i
think
we're
able
to
hold
that,
don't
you
think?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
it's
a
terrible
--
it's
a
terrible,
outrageous
thing
for
the
government
to
do,
to
win
the
case
and
get
--
get
stare
decisis
effect,
and
then
to
say
you
can't
get
lawyers'
fees
because
there's
never
been
a
case,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
could
make
that
up,
couldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
