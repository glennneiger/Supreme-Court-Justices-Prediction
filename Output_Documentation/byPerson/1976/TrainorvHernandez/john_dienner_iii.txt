mr.
john
dienner
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
johnny
dienner
iii.
i
am
an
assistant
state’s
attorney
here
representing
the
defendants
below
morgan
finley,
the
circuit
court
clerk
and
richard
j.
elrod,
the
sheriff
of
cook
county.
mr.
bargiel,
also
with
me
here
from
the
attorney
general’s
office
and
will
be
speaking
for
defendants,
trainor
and
o’malley.
this
suit
originated
as
a
consequence
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aids
having
filed
an
action
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
wherein
the
plaintiff,
the
federal
plaintiff,
was
the
then
state
defendant
and
he
was
charged
with
having
fraudulently
concealed
certain
monies
which
he
and
his
wife
had
in
a
credit
union
from
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
when
they,
the
hernandezs,
applied
for
public
assistance.
the
amount
that
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
asserted
that
they
received
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
was
$3,720.00.
the
compliant
in
the
appendix
starting
at
page
15,
sets
forth
the
facts
of
this
cause
of
action
and
the
allegations
and
facts
and
support
thereof
may
be
found
starting
at
page
15.
mr.
hernandez
with
his
counsel
came
to
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
and
filed
his
appearance.
when
he
found
that
the
attachment
action
had
been
continued
for
a
period
of
time
pursuant
to
local
circuit
court
of
cook
county
practice,
they
immediately
came
and
filed
the
instant
federal
action
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
eastern
division.
their
jurisdiction
was
based
upon
42
u.s.c.
1983
and
they
sought
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
from
the
illinois
attachment
act.
a
three-judge-panel
was
convened.
the
defendants
filed,
all
defendants
filed
motions
to
dismiss
and
the
plaintiff
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
classes
were
certified
both
plaintiff
and
defendant
classes,
and
the
three-judge-panel
ultimately
declared
the
operative
sections
of
the
illinois
attachment
act
to
be
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
due
process
rights.
and
the
defendants,
whom
i
represent,
defendants
finley,
elrod,
the
sheriff
and
court
clerk
were
enjoined
from
issuing
and
attaching
pursuant
to
that
act.
a
motion
for
stay
was
denied,
notices
of
appeal
were
filed
with
jurisdictional
statement
raising
all
issues
as
to
all
defendants
was
likewise
filed.
the
case
was
docketed
and
here
we
shall
proceed.
initially,
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
propriety
of
the
class
that
was
certified
by
district
judge
kirkland.
my
defendants
allege
and
assert
that
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
plead
compliance
with
rule
23
a3
in
establishing
the
propriety
of
the
plaintiff
class.
there
are
allegations
in
that
regard
reflective
on
two
counts.
first
of
all,
while
there
is
a
conclusory
allegation
of
irreparable
injury
as
to
all
plaintiffs
none
has
asserted
factually
in
support
of
the
class
members.
there
is
no
facts
upon
which
the
district
court
could
conclude
that
the
class
members
excluding
mr.
hernandez
suffered
any
irreparable
injury.
and
the
second
defect
is
that,
some
potential
class
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
are
also
creditors.
in
other
words,
any
person,
corporation
or
business
entity
could
be
an
attaché
as
well
as
a
person
attempting
to
attach
a
debtors
property
and
they
therefore,
would
have
no
particular
interest
in
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
herein.
in
fact,
their
interest
would
be
quite
to
the
contrary.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
we
did
mention
in
our
briefs,
both
our
original
briefs
and
our
reply
brief,
the
defect
--
mr.
john
dienner
iii
i
don’t
believe
that
the
defect
of
the
class
was
mentioned
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
no,
mr.
justice
stevens.
there’s
a
consequence
i
believe
that
the
class
for
relief
was
erroneously
granted
and
because
the
entry
of
that
order
of
certifying
the
class
was
of
course,
interlocutory
order,
it
is
not
made
final
until
the
final
order
is
presently
before
this
court.
i’d
like
to
speak
briefly
as
to
the
issue
of
abstention
as
well.
this
being
of
particular
concern
to
my
clients.
my
clients
believe
that
the
federal
courts
are
undoubtedly
the
ultimate
guarantors
of
all
person’s
federal
rights.
they
do
however
assert
that
the
state
courts
are
the
primary
guarantors
and
this
must
be
so
for
obvious
reasons,
otherwise,
every
federal
issue
conceivably
could
be
raised
by
any
plaintiff
or
defendant
in
any
typical
state
action
tort,
contract
and
the
like,
would
have
to
first
come
to
the
federal
district
court,
be
decided
on
a
constitutional
issues
remanded
to
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
or
any
other
state
court
for
further
trial
on
the
issues.
now
this
of
course,
relegates
the
state
courts,
in
my
opinion,
to
the
role
of
perhaps
masters
in
chancery
to
the
federal
district
courts.
and
this
is
quite
antagonistic
to
our
obviously
alleged
violations
of
comity
and
federalism
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
illinois
supreme
court
within
the
last
month
decided
a
case,
it
was
tax
injunction
suit,
28
east
jackson
and
in
that
case
the
court
made
query
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
not
in
fact
becoming
masters
in
chancery
to
the
local
district
court
but
of
course,
made
that
observation
in
passing.
now,
the
two
exceptions
that
will
allow
a
court
to
override
the
basic
premises
of
comity
and
federalism
as
one
there
is
either
a
bad
faith
enforcement
of
state
laws
not
at
issue
here
and
never
alleged
or
when
the
statute
is
violative
of
expressed
constitutional
provisions
in
every
clause,
paragraph,
and
sentence.
now,
there
were
no
such
allegations
of
bad
faith
enforcement
and
of
course
the
judge,
the
three-judge-court
did
not
find
the
violation
on
every
clause,
sentence,
and
paragraph.
as
a
consequence,
the
district
court,
in
its
failure
to
properly
take
account
of
comity
and
federalism
as
raised
and
specified
more
accurately
in
the
huffman
and
younger
decisions.
the
consequences
of
that
action,
it
results
in
204
state
of
illinois
officials
being
enjoined
from
acting
pursuant
to
a
lawfully
enacted
state
statute.
a
102
of
those
state
officials
are
county
sheriffs,
each
of
whom
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
maintaining
peace.
we
submit
that
the
creditors
as
a
result
of
being
denied
the
opportunity
to
use
the
court
systems
and
the
attachment
act
what
we
resort
to
self-help
was
available
under
common
law
and
uniform
commercial
code
and
contract
provisions
also
that
may
permit
self-help.
thereby,
establishing
a
far
greater
risk
of
breaches
of
peace.
to
this
of
course,
the
sheriffs
have
a
particular
interests.
this
federal
action
by
our
local
district
court
was
made
prior
to
any
state
court
determinations
or
interpretations
of
the
law.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
defendant
classes
were
certified
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
sheriff
richard
j.
elrod
of
cook
county
was
a
class
representative
on
behalf
of
all
similarly
situated
sheriffs
throughout
the
state.
so,
all
102
of
the
sheriffs
of
cook
county
were
class
defendants.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
they
certainly
had
that
expectation.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
that
amounts
as
i
said
to
over
200
state
officials
who’ve
been
enjoined
as
a
result.
now,
this
leaves
creditors
with
a
lack
of
full
and
complete
remedies
and
of
course
this
court
in
the
other
prejudgment
garnishment
type
of
actions
it
was
recognized,
the
creditors
have
no
fewer
rights
certainly
than
debtors
and
the
balance
must
be
struck
between
the
two.
and
we
assert,
of
course,
that
that
balance
was
struck
in
the
situation
and
that
the
federal
district
court
and
their
action
was
totally
unwarranted
in
this
regard
and
has
unnecessarily
interfered
with
matters
of
special
state
concern.
as
to
issues
of
state
remedies
available
and
the
like
i
at
this
point,
if
it
please
the
court
will
defer
to
mr.
bargiel
who
will
speak
for
the
attorney
general’s
office.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
yes,
if
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
two
quick
points:
first
as
to
our
appeal,
as
representatives
of
the
defendant
classes,
defendant
finley
and
elrod.
we
filed
our
notice
of
appeal
that
is
the
manner
in
which
an
appeal
is
taken
pursuant
to
supreme
court
rule
10-1,
pursuant
to
10-4
all
parties
below
are
parties
before
this
court,
rule
15-3
related
cases
from
the
same
court
can
file
a
single
jurisdictional
statement.
in
this
case,
all
issues
as
to
all
defendants,
state
defendants,
county
defendants,
and
class
defendants
were
raised
in
the
single
jurisdictional
statement.
in
rule
46
of
the
supreme
court
also
permissive
course
join
appeals
where
as
parties
who
were
jointly
severably
interested,
may
join
in
an
appeal.
in
the
court
below,
we
filed
the
motion
to
adopt
all
pleadings
that
have
been
by
the
state
defendants
and
it
will
be
filed
by
the
state
defendants
as
i
point
out
all
issues
as
to
all
defendants
were
properly
preserved
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
we
designated
ourselves
as
appellants
in
the
designation
of
portions
of
the
record
and
also
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
we
filed
notice
of
appeal,
we
filed
briefs
and
we
filed
appearance
in
the
supreme
court.
we
assert
that
on
the
court’s
own
rules,
there
is
no
question
of
the
fact
that
the
representatives
of
the
class
and
the
class
themselves
are
before
this
court
and
have
properly
preserved
all
issues
raised
below.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
we
filed
a
brief.
we
entitled
it
and
designated
as
the
brief
of
appellees
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
appellants.
but
i
think
that
was
erroneous
caption
but
as
by
no
means
jurisdictional.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
we
are
appellants,
we
assert.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
we
would
indeed.
we
assert
that
we
are
unequivocally
appellants
in
this
position,
we’re
mislead
initially
by
an
interpretation
of
supreme
court
rule
10-4
as
requiring
that
result
further
thought
in
reflection
on
the
matter
convinces
us
otherwise.
one
other
thing
that
this
is
--
mr.
john
dienner
iii
ultimate
importance
in
this
case
under
the
civil
practice
act,
the
attachment
debtors
have
an
unequivocal
right
under
the
civil
practice
act
of
illinois
on
two
days
notice
to
motion
up,
a
motion
to
quash,
dismiss,
file
a
counter
claim
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
john
dienner
iii
under
rule
26,
adopting
the
civil
practice
act
into
the
attachment
act.
they
had
a
possibility
of
filing
motion
to
dismiss,
summary
judgment,
declaratory
relief,
third
party
action,
i
could
site
you
the
sections
if
your
honors
were
interested.
one
last
matter
and
that’s
the--you
recall
that
the
plaintiffs
are
in
form
of
purpose
before
this
court.
thereby,
rendering
nugatory
and
much
benefited
proceeding
with
the
attachment
action
in
the
state
court
when
they
in
fact
are
apparently
judgment
proof.
thereby,
giving
explanation
for
the
dismissal
of
that
case
once
we
were
enjoined
from
attaching
our
assets.
i
assert
that
they
had
various
remedies
under
the
civil
practice
act
and
under
the
illinois
supreme
court
rules.
on
two
days
notice
they
could
have
been
in
court
presenting
and
preserving
all
of
their
constitutional
issues.
thank
you,
your
honors.
