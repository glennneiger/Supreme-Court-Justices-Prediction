this
is
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
case
arose
when
an
agency
of
the
state
sued
to
recover
welfare
payments
that
allegedly
had
been
fraudulently
received.
and
in
connection
with
that
action,
the
property
of
the
defendants
was
attached.
it
was
--
it
was
attached.
the
defendants
then
sued
in
the
federal
court
claiming
the
attachment
act
was
unconstitutional
and
asking
for
an
injunction.
the
district
court,
a
three-judge
court
as
i
have
said
sustained
that
claim
and
also
rejected
the

the
state's
view
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
state
court
and
the
federal
claims
be
raised
in
the
action
pending
there.
we
reversed
and
for
the
reasons
we
have
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
for
the
court,
we
hold
that
the
district
court
should
have
dismissed
the
action
and
remitted
the
federal
plaintiffs
to
the
state
court.
