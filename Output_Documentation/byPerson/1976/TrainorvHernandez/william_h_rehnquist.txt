justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
the
sheriffs
of
every
county
in
illinois
and
district
division,
the
sheriff
of
cook
county
bound
by
this
decree
of
the
district
court
or
are
you
just
suggesting
they
will
probably
obey
it
as
a
precedent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don’t
you
get
some
suggestion
from
the
district
court’s
opinion
however,
and
isn’t
it
also
too
generally
of
this
state
distinctions
between
contract
attachments
and
tort
attachments
that
the
reason
for
requiring
a
hearing
in
a
tort
attachment
is
to
fix
the
probable
amount
of
recovery
based
on
a
contract
claim
like
you
really
don’t
have
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
they
have
taken
about
two
or
three
pages
to
analyze
decisions
of
this
court
to
make
up
their
mind.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
trainor
was
the
only
name
of
the
appellant
on
the
docket?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
if
a
unconstitutional
delay
is
possible
under
its
terms?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
answer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
having
some
difficulty
keeping
the
various
state
and
federal
forums
of
state.
in
response
to
question
justice
stewart
where
you
answered
that
something
was
disposed
off
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
which
piece
of
litigation
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
it
granted
your
injunction
on
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
resolved
all
disputed
facts
in
favor
of
the
appellants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
enjoin
the
sheriff
and
the
clerk
but
you
say,
you
never
shouldn’t
have
gotten
into
the
case
of
the
plaintiff,
in
effect
the
plaintiff
doesn’t
get
any
benefit
from
the
abstention
because
what
he
is
trying
to
utilize
is
a
state
court
procedure
that
your
longing
to
be
used
against
somebody
else.
