mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
paul
bargiel.
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
from
the
state
illinois
and
i
represent
the
appellants
trainor
and
hernandez
in
this
matter.
appellant
trainor
is
the
director
or
acting
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
and
defendant
o’malley.
i’m
sorry
appellant
o’malley
is
an
employee
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
and
he
was
at
the
behest
of
appellant’s
o’malley
and
trainor
that
the
writ
of
attachment
which
is
the
subject
of
this
appeal
was
sued
out
in
the
lower
court.
in
the
brief
time
allotted
to
me,
i
would
like
to
take
a
very
simple
and
straight-forward
position
on
behalf
of
my
clients.
we
suggest
to
contend
to
the
court
that
anytime
a
plaintiff
comes
into
a
federal
court
and
seeks
an
injunction
intervening
in
a
pending
state
court
proceeding,
where
the
state
is
bringing
the
action
in
a
state
court
and
where
the
state
is
doing
so
in
aid
of
a
valid
and
legitimate
state
purpose
that
the
federal
court
ought
to
refrain
from
issuing
such
an
injunction
in
the
absence
of
exceptional
circumstances.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
several
–
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
where
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
correct.
because
that
is
the
facts
that--those
are
the
facts
which
the
record
presents
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
not
that
they
just
happen
to
be
the
facts
in
this
case
but
where
the
state
is
bringing
the
cause
of
action
and
they’re
doing
so
in
support
of
a
valid
and
legitimate
state
purpose,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principles
which
underlying
comity
and
federalism
are
obviously
more
appropriate
than
where
the
plaintiff
in
a
lower
court
action,
a
private
citizen
bringing
an
action
against
another
private
citizen
and
i
think
that
is
a
first
statement
of
some
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
recent
times.
the
exceptional
circumstances
under
which
a
plaintiff
in
a
federal
district
court
can
ask
for
an
injunction,
this
court
has
indicated
that
as
being
demonstration
or
showing
that
there
are
some
sort
of
bad
faith
on
behalf
of
the
state
bringing
the
action,
i
suppose
one
example
of
bad
faith
is
a
demonstration
that
the
purpose
of
bringing
the
action
on
behalf
of
the
state
is
to
harass
the
individual
defendant.
there’s
been
no
allegation
in
the
plaintiff’s
complaint
seeking
injunctive
relief,
that
there
is
any
bad
faith
purpose
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
illinois,
that
it's
purpose
is
to
harass.
there
was
no
finding
by
the
three-judge
court
in
its
order
of
memorandum
opinion,
that
the
state
was
acting
in
bad
faith
and
that
its
purpose
was
to
harass.
and
in
fact,
no
such
showing
can
be
made
because
the
purpose
which
the
state
was
actuated
by
in
this
case
was
to
recover
welfare
funds
which
were
dispersed
to
the
federal
court
plaintiff
pursuant
to
a
request
for
funds
wherein
he
lied
and
secreted
certain
assets
which
he
had.
there
are
two
affidavits
in
the
record
in
the
appendix,
i
should
say,
i
think
which
demonstrate
reasonably
clearly
that
the
federal
court
plaintiff
here
was
in
fact
in
all
probability
or
the
reasonable
inferences
that
he
was
guilty
in
fact
of
welfare
fraud.
the
affidavits
appear
at
if
i’m
correct
page
15
and
17
of
the
record,
appendix,
i’m
sorry.
and
let's
see,
i
apologize
page
52
and
53
of
the
record.
on
in
page
52,
there’s
an
affidavit
of
an
employee
of
the
company
at
which
the
federal
court
plaintiff
had
his
credit
union,
wherein
he
says
that
the
federal
court
plaintiff,
mr.
hernandez,
here
has
accumulated
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
the
credit
union
and
he
has
an
account
which
has
been
open
from
january
3,
1972
and
they
had
a
balance
on
him
of
$1,193.00
on
november
30,
1974,
this
is
in
paragraph
3
of
the
affidavit
at
page
52.
there
is
an
affidavit
at
page
53
of
an
employee
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid
wherein
the
employee
of
the
department
indicates
that
mr.
hernandez
received
public
assistance
for
the
same
period
and
in
fact
set
on
his
application
that
he
was
unemployed
and
he
had
no
assets.
so,
it
appears
to
me
quite
clear
that
the
state
was
actuated
by
a
valid
and
legitimate
state
purpose
in
this
particular
case
and
that
in
which
is
that
of
combating
welfare
fraud.
the
other
circumstance,
exceptional
circumstance,
under
which
a
plaintiff
might
be
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
to
restrain
a
pending
state
court
proceeding
from
going
forward
is
as
mr.
dienner
pointed
out,
in
a
situation
where
the
plaintiff
can
show
that
the
statute
in
question
is
patently
and
flagrantly
violative
of
a
constitutional
prohibitions
in
every
clause,
sentence,
phrase,
and
against
whomever
it
may
possibly
be
applied
to,
i
would
suggests
that
there
are;
first,
that
the
statute
here
on
attachment
act
has
never
at
least,
it's
validity
has
never
been
construed
by
the
illinois
states
supreme
court
and
we
would
submit
to
this
court
that
there
are
saving
constructions
and
applications
which
would
result
in
its
validity.
and
one
suggests
that
the
application
of
the
statute
which
we
submit
would
result
in
a
finding
that
would
be
constitutional,
involves
on
page
29
of
the
appendix,
the
application
of
section
2
which
talks
about
an
affidavit
in
the
statement.
it
says,
“in
all
action
sounding
in
tort
where
the
underlying
obligations
sounds
in
tort
that
before
an
attachment
shall
issue
upon
the
affidavit
of
the
attachment
creditor,
that
the
attachment
creditor
has
to
appear
before
a
judge
and
it
says,
before--i’m
reading
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
it
says
“before
the
writ
of
attachment
shall
be
issued,
the
plaintiff
his
agent
or
attorney
shall
apply
to
the
judges
of
the
circuit
court
of
the
county
in
which
the
suit
is
to
be
brought
or
is
pending
and
be
examined
under
oath
by
such
judge
concerning
the
cause
of
action.
so,
it
is
clear
that
even
though
there
is
no
notice
before
the
attachment
takes
place
where
the
underlying
action
sounds
in
tort
that
the
judgment
creditor
would
have
to
or
attachments
creditor
would
have
to
appear
before
a
judge
and
be
examined
concerning
his
cause
of
action.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
in
this
particular
case,
no,
your
honor.
because
the
department
apparently
took
the
position
when
they
filed
it
--
they
did
not,
they
did
not
take
the
position
that
the
underlying
action
sounded
in
tort.
that
may
have
been
a
mistake
but
it
did
not--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
with
regard
to
the
question
of
abstention
that
is
at
the
very
least
one
easy
example
of
how
the
statute
might
be
constitutionally
applied.
i
am
not
saying
that
it's
limited
to
that.
but
for
that
purpose,
i
am
suggesting
it.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
frankly
don’t
get
that
impression.
i
know
that
the
three-judge
district
court
in
its
opinion
apparently
construed
that
provision
of
the
statute
as
limiting
it
to
a
determination
of
the
amount
of
damages
in
a
tort
action.
however,
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
itself
which
is
not
being
construed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
indicates
that
the
attachment
creditor
shall
appear
before
a
judge
and
be
examined
concerning
the
cause
of
action.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
your
honor
that
that
is
a
very
limiting
construction
which
was
indulged
by
the
federal
district
court
and
not
one
which
would
necessarily
be
indulged
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
or
at
least
the
courts
of
illinois
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
to
construe
that
section.
that
would
be
my
position
with
regard
to
that.
i
think
that
the
language
itself
is
broad
enough
to
incorporate
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
pardon?
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well
i
don’t
say
that
they
could.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no.
that
is
not
my
position
at
all.
again,
with
regard
to
this
one
particular
provision,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
this
is
an
implication
of
the
statute
which
will
result
in
the
finding
of
its
constitutionality.
what
i
think
is
with
regard
to
these
plaintiffs
and
the
facts
which
are
presented
here,
i
think
that
these
plaintiffs
had
an
opportunity.
and
i
must
say
too,
but
before
i
leave
that
point,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
federal
district
court
never
did
make
a
finding
that
the
statute
was
patently
and
flagrantly
violative
of
the
constitution
in
every
clause,
phrase
and
so
on.
and
while
they
make
with
some
reference
to
that
in
their
memorandum.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
they
said
it
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
it
appears
to
me
that
there
are
some
questions
to
whether
or
not--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
that’s
true
too.
i
believe
it
says
patently
and
flagrantly
violative
on
its
face.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
i
will
consider.
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
okay.
yes,
i
will
agree
to
that.
it
is
not
exactly
clear
to
me
which
standard
they
were
applying
at
that
particular
time.
i
would
like
to
if
i
may
in
a
very
minutes
that
i
have
left,
to
address
myself
to
that
fact
or
the
other
aspects
of
the
question
of
abstention
whenever
a
federal
court
plaintiff--whenever
a
plaintiff
comes
in
the
federal
court
and
requests
an
injunction
to
stop
a
state
court
proceeding,
the
second
prerequisite
and
i
submit
that
the
first
was
not
met
here.
that
there
was
no
demonstration
of
clear
and
immediate
irreparable
injury
as
required
by
this
court’s
decisions.
the
second
prerequisite
is
the
plaintiff
has
to
demonstrate
to
the
federal
court
that
he
has
no
opportunity
to
timely
raise
and
have
adjudicated
by
competence
state
tribunal
of
federal
questions
or
issues
which
were
presented.
and
our
position
here
today
is
that
the
plaintiffs
of
this
particular
case
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
all
these
questions
in
a
timely
fashion
before
a
competent
state
tribunal
and
conceivably
could’ve
had
direction
in
the
relief
that
they
are
requested
before
the
13
months
that
it
took
for
the
federal
district
court
to
enter
its
injunctions.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
would
certainly
take
the
position
that
they
had
a
remedy
available
to
them.
yes,
but
that's
at
a
very
basic
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
i--yes
sir.
i
think
that
is
true.
i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
oh,
i
--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
my
point
is
that
younger
and
huffman
versus
pursue
reflect
the
idea
that
in
my
reading
is
an
indispensable
prerequisite
to
obtaining
relief
in
a
federal
court
by
way
of
an
injunction
plan.
that
is
to
show
that
he
has
no
opportunity
to
raise
these
questions
in
having
timely
decided
in
the
state
court.
i'm
saying
yes,
he
has
an
adequate
remedy
but
i'm
also
saying
that
huffman
and
younger
reflect
that
kind
of
philosophy
and
i
think
preclude
this
kind
of
relief
here.
our
position
is
that
the
plaintiff
could
have
anytime
after
the
writ
of
attachment
was
issued
came
in
–
he
could
have
come
into
state
court,
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
writ.
he
could
have
contested
the
facts
upon
which
the
writ
was
issued.
he
could
have
tested
the
legal
sufficiency.
that
he
could’ve
raised
the
constitutional
objections
that
he
wanted
to
or
that
he
has
ultimately
raised
in
the
federal
court
including
this
motion,
they
stop
for
hearing
at
a
time
convenient
to
him
upon
proper
notice
to
the--in
this
case
illinois
department
of
public
aid.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
on
page
43
of
the
appendix,
section
26
of
the
illinois
attachment
act,
indicates
that
provisions
to
the
civil
practice
act
in
the--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
page
43,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
section
26,
i'm
sorry.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
it
talks
about
civil
practice
act
applications.
it
says,
“the
provisions
in
the
civil
practice
act
which
govern
a
trial
procedure
instead
of--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
it
says
including
the
provisions
for
appeal
in
all
existing
and
future
amendments
in
the
rules
now
and
hereafter
adapted
shall
apply
to
all
the
proceedings
here
under
except
as
otherwise
provided.
in
section
70
of
the
civil
practice
act--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
i'm
sorry
that
is
not
in
the
appendix.
i
happen
to
have
it
here.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
section
70
of
the
illinois
civil
practice
act.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
it
says,
the
section
70
motion,
is
a
motion
to
quash.
it
says,
any
party
or
i'm
sorry,
“a
party
intervening
to
move
to
set
aside
or
quash
any
execution
bond
or
other
proceeding
may
apply
to
the
court
or
to
a
judge
at
his
chamber
for
certificate,
that
there
is
probable
cause
for
staying
for
proceedings
until
the
order
of
the
court
on
the
motion
and
i
am
saying
that
he
could
have
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
writ
of
attachment
with
the
judge
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
contesting
the
legal
facts
upon
which
the
writ
was
issued.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
think
he
could
--
well,
no
i'm
saying
i
don’t
think
he
could’ve
raised
anything
in
that
writ,
that’s
my
position.
i
got
some
–
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
i
think--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
no,
i
don’t
have
an
illinois
case
to
site
to
you
now,
your
honor.
however,
in
garnishment
cases
which
offer
somewhat
the
same
procedure
the--under
somewhat
the
same
procedure,
our
office
has
been
served
with
writs
of
garnishment
for
state
employees
and
the
attorney
general
has
regularly
gone
into
state
courts
and
moved
to
quash
the
writs
of
garnishment
and--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
well,
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
initially
we
took--we
said
the
state
was
not
the
subject
to--
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
yeah,
i
think
that
that’s
such
a
matter
that
could
be
raised.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
i
do
not
have
a
case
to
site
to
you
now.
no.
mr.
paul
j.
bargiel
yes,
at
this
particular
point
that
that
is
true.
the
section
27
which
is
on
the
following
page
of
the
illinois
attachment
act
says
that
the
defendant
can
answer
traversing
effects
stated
in
the
affidavit
upon
which
the
attachment
is
issued
and
the
answer
has
to
be
verified.
it
says,
they
could
file
a
counter
claim.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plaintiff
can
file
because
the
civil
practice
act
applies
to
this
particular
procedure
that
the
plaintiff
can
file
any
motion
which
he
could
file
in
any
civil
proceeding
and
he
could
call
that
motion
up
for
a
hearing
on
proper
notice
to
the
other
parties.
in
this
particular
case,
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid.
and
i
think
that
he
could
raise
all
of
the
questions
which
he
has
raised
in
the
federal
district
court.
i
see
that
my
time
is
long
since
expired
and
if
there
are
no
questions.

oh,
i
see
the
white
light
was
on.
any
way
if
if
it
is
not
expired,
i
think,
i’ve
at
least
attempted
to
make
my
point
which
is
that
the
court,
the
federal
district
court,
in
this
case
should
have
abstained
because
there
was
no
showing
of
clear
and
immediate
irreparable
injury.
and
i
think
that
there
was
inadequate
remedy
in
this
state
court
available
to
the
plaintiff
for
adjudication
of
these
federal
claims.
thank
you.
