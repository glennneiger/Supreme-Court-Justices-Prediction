mr.
fred
l.
lieb
mr.
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
propriety
of
the
injunction
against
appellees
finley
and
elrod,
and
the
class
of
county
court
clerks
and
sheriffs
that
they
represent
has
not
properly
been
presented
to
this
court
for
review.
appellees
finley
and
elrod
did
not
file
any
jurisdictional
statement
raising
any
questions
for
review.
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
the
appellants
did
not
challenge
the
class
nor
did
it
challenge
the
propriety
of
the
injunction
against
defendant
classes
of
clerks
and
sheriffs.
it
merely
raised
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
injunction
against
the
appellees--the
appellants
proceeding
against
the
appellees
in
the
state
court.
appellees
submit
that
in
light
of
this
fact,
the
injunction
against
the
class
of
county
court
clerks
and
sheriffs
cannot
be
vacated
on
the
appeal
of
the
appellants
since
that
issue
has
not
been
properly
presented
to
this
court
for
review.
thus,
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
under
the
rules
of
this
court,
he
is
not
an
appellant.
in
fact,
their
brief
is
submitted
as
appellees
in
support
of
the
appellant’s
position.
they
did
not--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes.
but
i
believe
that
was
mistaken
of
--
it
says
jurisdictional
statement
for
appellants
trainor
and
o’malley
and
this
court
was
docketed
as
case
of
trainor
versus
hernandez.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
trainor
and
o’malley.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
10-1
states,
i
believe
it’s
10-1,
states
that
“all
parties
in
the
proceeding
below
shall
be
parties
in
this
supreme
court.”
however,
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
precisely.
however,
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
the
appellants
does
not
raise
the
propriety
of
the
injunction
against
the
appellees,
the
clerks
and
the
sheriffs
throughout
illinois.
therefore,
this
injunction
cannot
be
challenged
on
appeal
and
that
injunction
must
remain
in
full
force
and
effect
regardless
of
how
the
court
rules
on
the
appeal
of
the
appellants
trainor
and
o’malley.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
younger
and
huffman
under
those
cases,
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
of
each
case
and
there
may
also
be
particular
circumstances
regarding
each
party.
now
in
this
particular
case,
eventhough
i
submit
it,
it’s
not
really
before
the
court,
there
is
different
circumstances.
finley
and
elrod
were
not
parties
to
the
state
court
proceedings.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
they
are
representatives
of
the
class.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i
don’t
believe
that
the
court
could
even--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
we
asked
for
the
class
and
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
no,
your
honor.
we
like
it
very
much.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
your
honor,
the
class--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes,
appellees
finley
and
elrod.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
no.
as
appellees
only.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
the
appellants
are
trainor
and
o’malley
who
were
the
attachment
creditors
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
appellants
trainor
and
o’malley,
the
attachment
creditors.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right.
all
the
other
named
parties
and
the
class
parties.
in
light
of
this
fact
alone,
we
submit
that
either
the
appellant's
appeal
must
be
dismissed
or
the
judgment
affirms,
and
there’s
absolutely
no
effective
relief
that
the
court
can
give
the
appellants.
if
the
injunction
remains
in
effect,
no
creditors,
including
the
appellants
can
obtain
prejudgment
that
had
been
sought
in
illinois.
now,
the
appellants
have
emphasized
the
fact
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
we
are
here
because
the
appellants
filed
a
jurisdictional
statement
and
this
court
knows,
there's
probable
jurisdiction.
however,
i
submit
that
the
issues
raised
in
their
appeal
do
not
allow
the
court
to
vacate
the
injunction
against
appellees,
class
representatives
who
have
not
appealed.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
we
raised
that
point.
first
of
all,
we
raised
it
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
second,
we
raised
it
as
point
one
in
our
brief.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes,
we
initially
moved
to
dismiss
this
entire
appeal.
however,
the
court
had
noted
probable
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that
would
be
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
appellants--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
it
is
not
is--well,
there
are
two
places
where
that
would
be
found.
one
would
be
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
the
other
point
would
be
in
our
brief--argument
one
of
our
brief
at
page
15.
the
appellants
have
claimed
that
they
are
state
officials
and
that
they
were
carrying
out
specific
state
function
here
and
therefore
the
injunction
against
them
was
improper.
and
they
point
to
the
case
of
huffman
versus
pursue.
that
case
however
is
totally
an
opposite
to
the
present
case.
in
that
case,
state
officials
were
bringing
a
quasi-criminal
action
pursuant
to
a
specific
statute
which
gave
those
officials
the
exclusive
right
to
bring
that
action.
in
the
instant
case,
the
appellants
utilized
a
general
creditor’s
remedy
which
can
be
utilized
by
any
creditor
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
as
the
district
court
noted
it
was
mere
happen
stance,
the
creditor
in
this
case
happen
to
be
in
the
state.
furthermore,
the
district
court
did
not
enjoin
appellants
from
proceeding
against
appellees
in
the
state
court
on
their
claim
against
the
appellees.
in
spite
of
the
district
court’s
injunction
against
the
prejudgment
seizure
of
property
under
the
illinois
attachment
act.
the
appellants
were
always
free
to
proceed
against
the
appellees
in
the
state
court
on
their
money
claim.
however,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
appellants
voluntarily
chose
to
dismiss
those
proceedings.
they
state
those
proceedings
and
ultimately
dismissed
those
proceedings
although
nothing
in
the
federal
court
injunction
required
them
to
do
so.
thus,
any
claim
of
interference
with
their
attempts
to
sue
the
appellees
simply
cannot
be
taken
seriously.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
your
honor,
there’s
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i
believe,
it’s
their
burden.
they
are
the
appellants.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
i
believe
we
sustain
that
burden
in
the
district
court.
while
the
district
court
proceedings
were
pending,
the
appellant
stayed
those
state
court
proceedings.
once
the
federal
district
court
enjoined
the
attachment,
enjoined
the
appellees
from
proceeding
to
utilize
the
attachment
act
any
further.
the
appellants
dismissed
their
case
on
the
merits
against
the
appellees.
therefore,
any
claim
that
they
make
that
the
federal
district
court
interfered
with
their
attempts
to
sue
the
appellees
in
the
state
court
or
to
interfere
with
the
litigation
at
all
in
the
state
court
simply
doesn’t
have
any
merit
because
they
just
dismissed
that
suit
sue
sponte.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
however,
the
appellees
were
working.
they
could
certainly,
if
they
could
have
possibly
obtained
a
judgment
here
and
i
don’t
think
that
the
record
shows
that
they
could
have.
but
have
they
obtained
a
judgment,
they
could
have
utilized
a
whole
variety
of
post
judgment
procedures
to
execute
upon
their
judgment.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
there
are
number
of
reasons
mr.
justice
white
why
we
went
to
the
federal
court.
first
of
all,
we
were
raising
a
constitutional
claim
and
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes,
your
honor.
however,
this
was
a
federal
claim
under
1983
for
an
injunction
against
state
officials
charge
with
the
execution
of
the
act.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
not
in
a
timely
manner.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
first
of
all,
it
has
to
be
emphasized
that
whenever
the
issue
is
raised
in
the
state
court,
it’s
always
after
the
injury
has
occurred.
the
property
is
seized
without
as
we
allege
due
process
of
law.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
we
could
have
tried,
your
honor
but
there
is--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
there
is
no
expressed
provision
in
the
act.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
we
could’ve
attempted
to
do
so.
there
is
no
precedent
which
would
allow
us
to
have
done
that.
we
could
put
it--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
no,
there
is
a
number
of
ways.
one
is
putting
up
a
bond;
the
other
is
by
answering
the
affidavit
on
the
merits
that
is
denying
the
grounds.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right.
and
then
ultimately,
there
will
be
a
trial
in
that
issue.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
if
you
win
on
the
merits
of
the
attachments.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i'm
sorry.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right.
at
the
hearing
of
the
attachment.
if
the
creditor
files
an
affidavit,
they
act
provides
that
the
debtor
may
file
a
counter
affidavit.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
and
that
there
will
be
a
hearing
on
the
factual
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
an
attachment
was
justified.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
act
for
moving
for
any
other
type
of
hearing.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
we
could
have
filed
a
separate
suit
in
state
courts.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes.
i
think
we
could
have
filed
the
separate
suit
in
state
court.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
exactly.
however,
i
don’t--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
exactly.
however,
i
don’t
believe
that
younger
versus
harris
requires
an
exhaustion
of
all
state
remedies.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
the
law
in
illinois
is
unsettled
on
that.
and
the
question
is
to
whether
you
can
get
class,
plaintiff
class
and
the
defendant
class
relief.
we
might
have
gotten
an
injunction
in
this
instant
case.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
no.
the
answer
is
no.
the
answer
is
no,
your
honor
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right.
we
could
have
gone
into
state
court
in
a
separate
proceeding
and
file
the
1983
act.
appellees
submit
that
three
decisions
of
these
court
are
clear
authority
for
affirming
the
district
court’s
decision
to
proceed
to
the
merits
of
this
case.
those
decisions
are
lynch
versus
household
finance,
fuentes
versus
shevin,
and
gerstein
versus
pugh.
lynch
and
fuentes’
concerned
summary
credit
or
remedies
almost
identical
to
the
illinois
attachment
act
under
review.
that
the
lynch
case
concerned
prejudgment
garnishment
and
in
effect
this
case
is
a
garnishment,
since
the
property
was
held
in
the
hands
of
a
third
party.
and
i
might
add,
that
lynch
was
also
a
garnishment
of
a
credit
in
to
that
account.
in
lynch
and
in
fuentes,
the
court
found
the
proceeding
the
prejudgment
seizure
not
to
be
a
proceeding
in
state
court.
in
lynch,
the
court
considered
the
question
of
applicability
of
the
injunction
act
and
in
fuentes
the
court
directly
considered
the
question
as
to
whether
younger
was
a
part
to
this
proceeding.
and
i’d
like
to
quote
from
fuentes
because
i
believe
this
quote
is
directly—
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
in
fuentes,
there
would
have
been
an
eventual
hearing
on
the--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
the
difference
--
yes,
under
section
26,
we
could
have.
yes,
under
section
26
we
could
have.
however,
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
an
immediate
post
seizure
hearing.
it
says,
“you
can
answer
the
affidavit
by
filing
a
counter
affidavit
and
there
shall
be
a
trial
there
on.”
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
but
you
see
an
attachment
is
different
from
the
replevin
where
the
under
--
in
a
replevin
the
question
of
possession
of
pendente
lite
is
almost
identical
to
the
question
of
ultimate
right
to
possession.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
the
way
the
procedure
works
is
this.
the
writ
of
attachment
which
is
served
upon
the
debtor
indicates
at
the
bottom
that
hearings
on
attachment
will
be
disposed
on
the
return
date.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
after
the
date
of
the
writ.
in
this
instant
case,
we
did
appear
on
the
return
date
and
we
asked
for
a
hearing
and
we
were
denied
a
hearing
and
we
were
told
that
these
cases
are
routinely
heard
30
days
later.
so,
there
could
be
a
90-day
period
before
you
have
the
opportunity
for
that
hearing.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
the
delay
is
possible
under
the
statute.
there’s
no
right
to
move
for
an
earlier
hearing.
so,
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
since
there
was
possibility
for
a
delay
of
that
long
or
greater.
the
act
doesn’t
even
say
you
have
to
have
a
hearing
under
return
date.
the
act
just
says,
there
shall
be
a
trial
thereon.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
this
has
to
be
seen
in
terms
of
the
mitchell
decision
where
the
court
found
that
one
of
the
saving
aspects
of
the
louisiana
prejudgment
sequestration
statute,
was
that
there
was
an
expressed
provision
for
an
immediate
post
seizure
hearing.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
the
illinois
attachment
act
does
not
have
an
expression
for
its
provision
for
an
immediate
post
seizure.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
eventually,
as
in
fuentes.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
it
is
not
about
a
motion
to
quash
would
be
for
a
defect
in
the
writ.
if
it
wasn’t
properly
pleaded
under
the
act
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
and
the
creditor--the
creditor
can
amend
the
writ
and
continue
the
attachment.
the
hearing
is
provided
for
only
in
section
26
which
says,
“eventually,
you
are
entitled
to
a
trial
on
the
attachment
issue.”
it
doesn’t
say
when.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
it’s
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
and
i
would
add,
anytime
that
the
debtor
comes
in
and
asks
for
earlier
hearing,
the
creditor
could
have
got
to
that
on
the
grounds
that
he’s
not
prepared
and
he
would
ordinarily
have
the
right
at
that
later
hearing.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i
believe
that
was
december
3,
1974.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
we
get
--
first
of
all,
we
got
the
district
court
decision
a
year
later.
we’re
talking
now
about
an
appeal
to
this
court
which
has
taken
further
time.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
first
of
all,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
we
got
relief
in
the
district
court.
we
moved
for
a
temporary
retraining
order
and
that
was
not
decided
but
it
was
settled
so
that
we
did
get
half
of
the
funds.
the
due
process
issue
was
briefed
and
we
would’ve
gotten
the
decision
in
june
but
during
this
time,
the
huffman
decision
came
down
and
we
are
asked
to
re-brief
that
issue.
now,
that
is
only
something
that
would
happen
once
if
this
court
would
resolve
that
issue
in
our
favor,
that
issue
would
not
come
up
again.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i
think
that
would
be
rewriting
the
statute,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
that
has
to
be
read
in
pari
materia
with
the
return
date
provision.
that
the
return
date
can
be
set
anywhere
from
10
to
60
days.
and
the
common
understanding
of
the
return
date
is
when--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right.
and
i’d
like
to
add
too
on
this
point
that
these
procedural
protections
have
to
be
seen
working
together,
not
separately.
a
major
defect
in
this
case
as
we
have
pointed
out
is
the
lack
of
the
requirement
to
plead
facts
in
the
affidavit
which
would
support
the
grounds
for
the
attachment
and
the
requirement
of
having
to
be
up
here
before
a
judge
to
establish
with
these
factual
grounds
indeed.
so,
even
if
there
were
an
eventual
hearing,
even
if
the
right
to
a
move
for
a
hearing,
the
initial
seizure
does
not
have
adequate
safeguards
to
protect
the
debtor
from
a
constitutional
deprivation
of
his
property.
on
that
point
of
the
wrongful--possibility
of
a
wrongful
deprivation,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
a
point
raised
by
the
appellants
that
is
that
they
had
a
meritorious
claim
here
and
that
they
were
justified
in
the
attachment.
now,
it
is
not
the
role
of
this
court
to
determine
that
issue.
i
think
that
an
examination
of
what
really
happened
points
out
the
great
possibility
in
this
case
of
a
wrongful
attachment.
the
affidavit--the
papers
filed
by
the
appellants
in
the
federal
district
court--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
the
merits
of
the
state
court
plan.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
certainly,
and
we
were
well
prepared
to
litigate
that
in
the
state
courts
and
nothing
in
the
federal
district
court
injunction
prevented
any
of
the
parties
from
litigating
that
in
the
state
courts.
now,
the
affidavits
that
the
appellants
have
referred
to
actually
established
that
there
was
no
grounds
for
fraud.
unfortunately,
in
their
printing
of
the
appendix
the
affidavit
which
appears
on
page
52,
there
is
an
insert,
an
attachment,
regarding
how
much
money
was
in
the
account
at
the
time
the
alleged
fraud
took
place.
that
does
appear
in
the
record
at
item
5.
now,
their
affidavit
in
the
case
of
mr.
hernandez
applied
for
public
assistance,
march
24,
1972.
the
itemized
statement
of
his
account
indicates
that
on
that
date
he
had
$55.00
in
his
credit
union
account.
now
under
illinois
law,
fraud
cannot
be
alleged
in
a
conclusory
fashion,
except
in
the
illinois
attachment
act.
when
you
file
a
compliant
for
fraud,
you
have
to
allege
specific
factual
allegations.
you
have
to
allege
misrepresentation
of
a
specific
fact,
scienter
intent
to
deceive,
materiality
of
the
allegation,
reliance
and
damages.
if
the
attachment
creditor
had
been
required
to
allege
those
specific
facts
and
to
present
that
to
a
judge
or
any
other
officer
who
knows
what
the
law
is
in
illinois,
this
attachment
would
never
have
been
issued
because
a
person
who
applies
for
public
aid
can
have
more
than
$55.00
in
assets
at
the
time
he
applies.
so
that,
if
they
had
alleged
the
specific
allegation
that
he
said
he
didn’t
have
anything
and
he
really
has
$55.00.
they
couldn’t
allege
materiality
because
he
would
have
gotten
the
money
anyway.
the
record
also
shows
that
mrs.
hernandez
didn’t
even
have
a
credit
union
account
at
that
time
and
furthermore
that
she
wasn’t
the
person
who
applied
to
public
aid.
therefore,
she
made
no
misrepresentations.
so
therefore,
if
the
specific
facts
would
have
had
been
plead
in
the
state
court
to
a
judge
based
on
their
own
evidence
in
the
record
there
wouldn’t
have
been
an
attachment.
yet,
because
of
the
fact
that
you
cannot
get
an
attachment
by
filing
an
affidavit
with
conclusory
allegation
of
fraud
presented
to
a
court
clerk,
who
really
stamps
that
affidavit
and
sends
summarily
onto
the
sheriff,
they
were
able
to
deprive
these
persons
and
all
other
persons--and
all
other
creditors
are
able
to
deprive
all
of
the
persons
similarly
situated
of
their
property
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes,
your
honor.
it
is.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
the
statements
where
made
in
our
allegations
in
the
compliant
which
were
not
denied.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
there
was
no
testimony.
this
was
all
handled
on
affidavits
and
quash--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
no.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i
don’t
believe
there’s
any
dispute
as
to
that
fact.
i
believe
that
all
attorneys
who
practice
in
illinois--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
we
allege
that
in
our
compliant
that
it
was
not
denied.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
only
in
tort
cases
and
that’s
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes.
only
in
tort
cases
and
that’s
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
in
contract
cases
that’s
presented
to
a
court
clerk
in
--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i
believe
we’re
both
making
the
same
allegation
here.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
we
agree
on
this.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
summary
judgment.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that
is
correct
under
the
statutes.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
true.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
no,
we
haven’t.
first
of
all,
the
problem
is
with
the
state
and
in
order
to
sue
the
state,
you
would
have
to
go
onto
the
court
of
claims
and
it’s
a
very
difficult
procedure
with
no
right
of
appeal
and
the
initial
problem
we
confronted
was
the
constitutional
problem
for
the
appellees
and
the
members
of
the
class.
so
therefore,
we
try
to
get
that
resolved
first.
there
is
a
damage
claim
pending
in
the
federal
courts
right
now
under
this
1983
action.
and
that
will
be
reconsidered,
and
we
intend
to
pursue
that.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
right.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes,
sir.
the
federal
court
sued
this
case.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
cross
motion.
motion
to
dismiss
and
a
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
correct.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
now,
i’d
like
to
go
back
to
the
huffman
issue
and
point
out
that
gerstein
versus
pugh
case
i
believe,
disposes
off
this
issue
in
our
favor.
that
in
that
case,
unanimous
court
concluded
that
younger
versus
harris
was
not
a
bar
to
a
federal
injunction
against
pretrial
detention
of
arrestees
charged
by
a
prosecutor
on
information
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
i
would
like
to
quote
briefly
from
that
statute
because
it
bears
directly
on
this
case.
the
court
noted
the
injunction
was
not
directed
at
the
state
prosecution
as
such
but
only
at
the
legality
of
pretrial
detention
without
a
judicial
hearing
--
an
issue
that
could
not
be
raised
in
defense
of
the
criminal
prosecution.
the
order
to
hold
preliminary
hearings
could
not
prejudice
the
conduct
of
the
trial
on
the
merits.
in
this
case,
district
court
injunction
was
not
directed
at
the
state
court
proceedings
as
such.
that
is
at
the
merits
of
the
underlying
claim.
but
only
at
the
legality
of
pretrial
detention
of
the
property
which
had
been
carried
out
without
due
process
of
law.t
hat
issue
could
not
be
raised
as
a
defense
to
the
main
claim
of
the
creditor.
and
finally
and
most
importantly,
for
purposes
of
younger,
the
resolution
of
the
constitutional
issue
in
the
federal
court
did
not
prejudice
in
any
way,
the
litigation
of
the
conduct
of
the
merits
in
the
state
court.
i
believe
in
light
of
the
gerstein
case
and
the
fuentes
and
lynch
case
which
i
mentioned
previously
that
the
district
court’s
decision
to
proceed
to
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim
and
to
enjoin
the
county
officials
from
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
the
illinois
attachment
act
was
clearly
correct.
therefore,
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
yes.
parties
must
properly
appeal.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
against
them
but
not
against
the
other
parties.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i
believe
the
only
decision
the
court
could
reach
is
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
reached
the
question
of
the
injunction
against
the
appellants.
there
may
have
been
other
considerations
and
as
i
submit
there
were.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
i
believe
that
under
younger,
one
can
consider
the
various
circumstances
concerning
each
one
of
the
appellants
or
each
one
of
the
defendants
in
federal
court
and
since
the
sheriffs
and
clerks
were
not
parties
to
the
state
court
proceedings,
there
would
be
different
considerations
going
to
whether
or
not
the
injunction
against
them
was
proper.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
well,
i
believe
the
appellant
could’ve
rectified
that
problem
by
number
one,
appealing
a
class
so
that
it
would
have
been--
the
issue
would
have
been
limited
to
–
had
they
succeeded
in
overturning
the
class
then
the
sole
question
would
be
the
injunction
against
them
in
favor
of
this
particular
plaintiff.
and
i
believe
they
could
have
presented
to
this
court
the
precise
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
injunction
was
proper
against
the
appellants.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
absolutely
your
honor.
it’s
not
a
matter
that
needs
to
be
straightened
out
by
the
district
court.
it’s
a
matter
that
the
party
should
have
straightened
out
before
the
appeal.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
finley
and
elrod
filed
an
appearance
when
they
were
first
served.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
this
was
before
the
class
was
certified.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
right.
we
then
move
for
certification
of
the
classes.
the
appellants
trainor
and
o’malley
filed
a
memorandum
in
opposition
to
the
class
to
the
certification
of
the
plaintiff
class.
they
never
even
raised
the
question
of
the
defendant
class.
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
no,
this
is
a
23b-2
class.
so,
i
believe
under
the
federal
rules
there’s
no
necessity—
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
the
record
does
not
show
that.
however,
it
is
my
understanding
that
after
the
judgment
was
issued,
notices
were
sent
out
to
the
various
sheriffs
and
clerks
informing--
mr.
fred
l.
lieb
this
was
an
agreement
between
the
parties.
thank
you.
