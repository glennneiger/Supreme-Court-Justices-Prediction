unless
we
have
it,
what
do
you
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
we
here
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
you
raise
that
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
remember
that.
i
didn’t
remember
the
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
page
is
that
in
the
beginning.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
it's
85,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
have
filed
an
action
for
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
act
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
violation
of
united
states
constitution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
one
is
separate
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
like
one
in
the
federal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
question
was
you
couldn’t?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
theoretically,
you
could
have
gotten
full
relief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
anything
in
the
illinois
law
that
says
you
could
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
there
is
a
possibility
you
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
lieb,
before
you
get
too
far
in
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
litigate
that
in
the
state
courts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
record
that
this
was
done
ministerially
by
some
officials
in
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
knows
that?
i
mean,
who
testified
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
is
there
anything
else
in
the
record?
is
there
positive
testimony
by
a
live
witness?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
an
affidavit
that
says
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
are
you
making
the
statement
as
a
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
admitted
by
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
state
said
that
you
cleared
it
before
a
judge,
you
presented
in
affidavit.
is
that
not
what
the
state
is
arguing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
argue
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
do
you
say
that’s
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
would
we
believe,
you
or
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
you
had
objected
of
they
getting
the
remand
and
so
this
could
be
straightened
out.
he
would?
i
assume
you
objected.
