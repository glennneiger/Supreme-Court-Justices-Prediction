unknown
speaker
if
you
look
at
page
82
in
the
appendix
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
it
clearly
appears
that
the
three-judge
district
court
thought
it
was
at
least
ordering
the
sheriff
to
be
in
every
county
in
illinois.
unknown
speaker
every
court
could.
unknown
speaker
where
the
state
or
state
agent
is
the
plaintiff
in
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
and
the
like
here
proposed--
unknown
speaker
you
got
any
better
reason
for
remedy
to
do
that?
do
they
happen
to
be
the
facts
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
that
didn’t
happen
in
this
case,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
but
this
goes
with
your
argument
that
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
in
every
letter–
unknown
speaker
it
maybe
one
or
two
parts
of
their
testimony.
unknown
speaker
how
could
they
construe
it
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
how
could
they
construe
it
in
this
case?
this
section
doesn’t
sound
and
--
unknown
speaker
so,
the
federal
court
should
abstain
until
somebody
else
files
some
other
lawsuit
raising
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
this
procedure
is
very
seldom
used,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
said
it
was
patently
and
flagrantly
violative
of
the
constitution,
they
didn’t
find
that?
unknown
speaker
they
also
used
the
words
patently
and
flagrantly
on
page
b5
of
the
jurisdiction
statement.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
may
be
wrong
but
at
least
they
said
it,
that
is
all
i'm
saying.
unknown
speaker
so,
is
your
point
that
they’re
quite
apart
from
the
younger
against
harris
or
anything
else
just
is
a
matter
of
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
that
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
of
law?
that
you
--
unknown
speaker
it's
quite
apart
from
dual
jurisdictions
or
federalism
or
anything
else
like
the
chancery
should
not
ever
issue
an
injunction
under
ordinarily
equitable
principles,
if
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
of
law.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
you
what
you
are
saying
that
whether?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
a
citation
or
some
rule
or
--
unknown
speaker
--some
statutory
provision
that
contemplates
this
kind
of
motion?
unknown
speaker
43?
unknown
speaker
and
it’s
at
what
paragraph?
unknown
speaker
now,
where
do
we
go
from
there?
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
that?
unknown
speaker
that
all,
just
give
me
the
citations.
section
70.
unknown
speaker
and
what
does
that
--
what
does
that
permit
a
person
to
do?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
the
end
--
just
contesting
his
right
to
an
attachment
or
the
facts
underlying
the
basic--
unknown
speaker
could
you
think
of
cases
for
that?
unknown
speaker
in
cases,
we
got
some
illinois
cases
illustrating
a
fellow
whose
bank
accounts
has
been
attached
coming
in
and
putting
the
credits.
unknown
speaker
on
what
ground?
unknown
speaker
on
the
motion
like
that,
will
the
court
listen
to
an
argument
for
that
as
a
note?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
have
any
illinois
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
saying
that
elrod
was
not
himself
an
appellant.
you’re
just
saying
he
didn’t
preserve
this
issue,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
the
jurisdictional
statement
on
the
face
at
least
in
that
lists
elrod
as
an
appellant,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn’t
our
rule
10
cover
it?
i
maybe
wrong
with
the
number.
unknown
speaker
require
it.
unknown
speaker
but
it
also
permits
them
to
adopt
the
co-appellants’
position
and
i
thought
they’ve
done
that
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
we
say
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
in
the
case
brought
against
elrod?
nonetheless,
it's
injunctive
decree
as
to
other
people
who
were
just
named
as
a
class
of
defense
would
remand
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
suggesting
of
it,
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
what
was
their
class
--
were
they
members
of
a
class?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they
class
representatives
here?
unknown
speaker
well
and
so
if
it
were
held
that
the
court
should
have
abstained,
the
injunction
against
the
entire
class
would
be
set
aside.
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you’re
the
one
who
wanted
the
class,
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
then,
you
don’t
like
it
then?
unknown
speaker
well.
[laughter
attempt]
unknown
speaker
are
the
representatives
here
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
they
representatives
of
the
class
here,
as
appellants?
unknown
speaker
who
are
the
appellants?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
so
the
representatives
of
the
defendants
are
not
here
as
appellants.
who
appealed?
unknown
speaker
attachment
creditors.
everybody
else
is
an
appellee.
every
other
party
on
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
might
they
have
not
felt
that
in
the
absence
of
some
sort
of
garnishment
or
attachment,
the
judgment
would
just
be
worthless?
unknown
speaker
do
you
speculate
in
as
to
why
they
dismissed?
whose
burden
is
it
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
was
your
burden
to
make
up
the
claim
in
the
district
court
and
to
show
that
that
was
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they
dismissed
it
after
they
were
told
they
couldn’t
attach
in
connection,
didn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
gone
to
the
state
and
in
this
proceeding
in
the
very
preceding
that
was
pending,
could
you
have
presented
your
claim
in
a
timely
manner?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
what
i
want
to
know
how.
what
could
you
have
done
in
this
pending
state
action?
and
when?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
could
you
the
next
moment
--
could
you
the
moment
that
you
have
heard
about
it
gone
in
the
court
with
a
motion
and
challenged
not
only
the
grounds
for
the
attachment
but
ask
the
probable
cause
on
the
underlying
debt
be
established?
unknown
speaker
but,
is
there
a
procedure
available
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know—this
is
quite
what
i'm
asking
you.
could
you
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no
one
has
ever
been
attached,
has
ever
gone
into
court
trying
to
get
it
released.
it
is
only
way
you
can
release
it
by
putting
up
a
bond?
unknown
speaker
that
section
27.
unknown
speaker
will
i
know
but
that
doesn’t
release
the
attachment?
unknown
speaker
oh,
on
the
oath
at
the
end
of
the
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
attachment.
unknown
speaker
i
direct
your
attention
to
such.
both
spelled
out
on
the
top
of
page
44
of
the
appendix.
well,
suggested--
unknown
speaker
in
1983.
unknown
speaker
but
in
fuentes,
was
there
an
available
and
immediate
hearing
on
the
attachment?
unknown
speaker
eventual.
but
you
seem
to
indicate
to
them
under
these
proceedings,
you
could
have
gone
right
into
court
and
challenged
the
attachment
including
any
allegations
about
the
underlying
debt?
unknown
speaker
that
is
separate
though
from
the
trail
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
a
calendar
delay
are
you
talking
about
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
with
that
kind
of
mini
trial.
do
you
know
or
do
you
not
know
of?
unknown
speaker
that’s
from
10
to
60
days.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn’t
that
suggests
that
perhaps
the
class
of
sheriffs
of
a
102
counties
in
illinois
may
not
have
been
a
little
broad
because
you
wouldn’t
suggests
there’s
that
the
same
delay
and
everyone
of
the
101
guys
besides
cook
county,
wouldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
this
doesn’t
have
the
word
immediate,
it
is
not
a
provision
for
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
eventually,
it
doesn’t
say
eventually,
it
says
he
can
file
a
motion.
and
you’re
just
saying
it
might
be
later
but
it
might
be
sooner.
unknown
speaker
that’s
on
section
27.
unknown
speaker
section
27,
i'm
sorry.
doesn’t
the
statute,
at
least
the
district
court
said
that
the
statute
makes
it.
but
it’s
within
the
power
of
the
creditor
to
defer
the
hearing
for
at
least
60
days.
unknown
speaker
because
under
the
statute,
the
return
that
day,
he
must
make
no
less
than
10
and
no
more
than
60
days.
so,
the
hearing
is
not
going
to
be
before
return
day
and
he
could
defer
that--
unknown
speaker
--for
60
days.
unknown
speaker
on
what
date
did
you
begin
the
action
in
the
federal
district
court
approximately?
unknown
speaker
1974.
that
you
couldn’t
have
got
this
state
proceeding
move
along
before
the
lapse
of
two
years
and
now
two
months.
almost
two
months.
unknown
speaker
it’s
now
25
months
passed--
unknown
speaker
--since
you
could
have
sought
some
relief
within
60
days.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
if
the
district
court
had
abstained
in
this
case
not
necessarily
under
any
command
of
the
doctrine
of
younger
against
harris
but
it
just
abstained
to
allow
the
illinois
courts
to
construe
their
statute,
do
you
think
it's
quite
possible,
at
least
arguably
possible
that
the
illinois
courts
having
read
the
mitchell
against
grant
case
would
have
said
that
section
27
requires
a
prompt
hearing.
at
least
as
prompt
as
it
was
accorded
in
mitchell?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn’t—that’
not
contrary
to
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
that
hearing
cannot
be
before
the
return.
unknown
speaker
this
was
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
defendants
and
on
your
motion
for
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
the
motion
to
dismiss
admits
all
the
pleading,
well
pleaded
allegations
in
the
compliant.
unknown
speaker
before
you
sit
down
mr.
lieb,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
point
you
made
at
the
outset
of
your
argument.
in
this
case,
every
clerk
of
every
judicial
circuit
court
in
illinois
and
every
county
in
illinois
has
been
enjoined
ever
in
the
future
under
a
permanent
injunction.
from
ever
issuing
a
writ
of
attachment
under
this
law
and
every
sheriff
in
every
county
of
illinois
has
been
similarly
permanently
enjoined
from
ever
executing
any
such
writ.
it
is
your
point
as
i
get
that
that’s
why
it
is,
that’s
the
way
it’s
going
to
be
from
now
on
and
that
no
court
can
has--any
power
to
correct
that.
even
if
it’s
terribly
wrong,
the
judgment
of
some
court
or
another,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
i
said,
i
thought
it
was.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
no
appeal--notice
of
appeal
was
filed
here
but
it
was
never
followed
through
about.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
these
appellants
are
qualified
or
have
standing
the
raise
the
abstention
for
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know
but
the
court
can
only
can
and
can
it,
both
abstain
and
not
abstain?
and
what
if
it
were
held
that
courts
should
abstain,
as
these
appellants
say
it
should?
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
should
have
abstained
it
means
that
should
have
not
proceeded
as
judgment.
an
injunction,
yes.
kind
of
a
fight
for
getting
an
abstention.
it
should
not
have
considered
the
merits
of
your
lawsuit
if
it
should
have
abstained.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lieb,
did
any
defendant
ever
file
in
appearance
or
a
pleading
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
class
as
a
group?
they
all
purport
to
represent
the
defendant
class?
unknown
speaker
for
themselves
or
for
the
class?
unknown
speaker
before
it
was
certified.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
any
notice
having
gone
out
to
the
non-appearing
members
of
the
defendant
class
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
opt
in
or
out
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
there’s
none.
but
does
the
record
show
whether
the
members
of
the
class
who
were
not
individually
before
the
court
ever
received
the
actual
notice
of
any
of
the
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
pursuant
to
court
order
or
there
is
something
--
unknown
speaker
i
think,
they
should
have
the
appellee,
--
the
other
people
on
your
side
should
have
filed
the
brief
as
appellants.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
like
to
change
that
designation?
