mr.
levin
could
i
interrupt
because
i
want
to
interrupt
you,
supposing
instead
of
your
particular
client
you
had
a
person
who
had
been
married
prior
to
1968
and
applied
for
a
job
with
united
in
1967,
he
was
turned
down
because
she
was
married
and
then
she
is
employed
at
this
time.
so
that
she
didn’t
worked
for
the
1967
to
1968
because
of
the
no
marriage
rule,
would
she
have
the
same
claim
that
your
client
does,
the
seniority
for
that
period,
denial
of
employment
on
account
of
her
marriage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
honor,
if
that
she
complains
obvious
of
the
fact
that
she
was
treated
unlawfully,
then
you
are
not
really
seeking
seniority
for
the
period
subsequent
to
the
illegal
act;
you
are
seeking
seniority
for
the
time
when
they
treated
her
perfectly
lawfully.
in
other
words,
she
was
employed
up
till
1968.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
she
is
not
getting
credit
for
that
seniority
because
of
an
illegal
act
in
1968.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
why
wouldn’t
another
comparably
situated
qualified
stewardess
who
was
denied
employment
on
the
same
day,
but
as
a
new
employee
why
wouldn’t
she
be
entitled
to
make
the
same
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact
should
your
client
not
if
you
are
correct,
your
client
merely
get
relief
four
month,
four
years,
but
for
the
four
years
plus
whatever
additional
time
she
would
have
worked
but
for
the
unlawful…
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
employed
by
united
air
lines
as
a
flight
attendant
in
november
1966
through
february
1968.
he
was
rehired
in
february
of
1972.
assuming
as
she
alleges
that
her
separation
from
employment
in
1968
violated
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
employer
has
committed
a
second
violation
of
title
vii
by
refusing
to
credit
her
with
seniority
for
any
period
prior
to
february
of
1972
when
she
was
rehired.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
united
had
violated
the
act
because
its
seniority
system
perpetuated
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
for
reasons
stated
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
united's
seniority
system
is
neutral
in
operation.
we
then
reversed
the
contrary
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
