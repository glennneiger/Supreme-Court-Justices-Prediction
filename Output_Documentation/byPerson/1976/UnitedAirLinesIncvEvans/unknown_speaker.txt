mr.
bernstein,
has
united
ever
given
credit
to
another
situations
for
prior
service?
unknown
speaker
not
given
all
the
time.
unknown
speaker
and
say
those
are
only
are
the
only
other...
unknown
speaker
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
specifies
nothing.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on
with
that
let
me
see
if
i
have
got
this
last
point
clear.
you
say
there
was
no
burden
on
the
respondent
here
to
demonstrate
that
the
1968
termination
was
involuntary
by
showing
for
example
that
upon
her
marriage,
her
supervisor
came
and
said,
of
course
you
know,
you
got
to
resign
and
that
could
be
the
way
you
would
show
the
involuntary
in
this
way.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
burden,
did
you
know
that?
unknown
speaker
then
the
burden
is
clearly
on
her.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
analogy
use
in
machinists
case,
the
limitation
that
case
placed
on
the
notion
of
a
continuing
violation
when
you
have
the
statute
limitations?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
seniority,
if
your
opponents
are
right
about
the
seniority
violation,
then
their
argument
is
that
the
violation
is
a
continuing
one
and
it's
occurring
every
day.
unknown
speaker
well
i
am
not
sure
how
clear
my
question
was
you
say
you
derive
two
principles
from
the
machinists,
it
is
both
of
which
you
think
held
up
right.
unknown
speaker
are
you
testifying
here
today?
unknown
speaker
this
is
in
the
record,
let’s
not
hear
about
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
levin
you
mentioned
the
refusal,
rehire,
as
i
understand
that
the
no
marriage
rule
was
terminated
in
november
1968.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
your
client
was
not
employed
after
that
period
and
before
1972,
was
it
refusal
rehire
situation?
unknown
speaker
are
those
alleged
in
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
i
just
missed
them.
unknown
speaker
well
it
has
to
the
extent
of
18
months.
unknown
speaker
the
old
complaint
is
that
she
was
illegally
fired.
unknown
speaker
it
all
goes
back
to
that
and
yet
you
can’t
get
any
action
for
that
firing
in
any
court
any
place
in
the
world.
unknown
speaker
but
united
could
evaded
that
where
it
simply
by
not
rehiring.
unknown
speaker
well,
(inaudible)
relied
on
philips
doge
for
allowing
restitution
to
people
who
had
been
discriminated
against
and
philips
doge
rose
into
the
national
labor
relations
act,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
then
why
would
not
on
that
basis
then
back
pay
claims
be
entertainable?
unknown
speaker
well,
back
pay
claims
for
periods
beyond
the
six-month
period.
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
that,
but
you
apparently
say
that,
apparently
believe
that
it
took
a
special
provision
to
do
that.
your
claim
here
is
without
any
provision
like
that.
you
can
make
the
seniority
claim.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
would
not,
on
your
theory
you
would
not
need
any
special
provision
to
get
back
pay.
unknown
speaker
that
was
your
answer
the
last
time
and
i
know
is
your
answer
to
the
next
question
is
the
same
too
let
us
assume
that
it
is,
then
you
just
say
i
am
full,
i
have
not
got
any
places.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bernstein,
but
if
you
go
to
the
trial
in
this
case
and
suppose
the
respondent
could
show
that
another
employee
in
the
same
position
was
discharged
for
theft
and
three
years
later
it
was
found
out
that
employee
was
not
guilty
of
theft
and
was
rehired
and
automatically
given
full
seniority
rights,
that
would
put
a
damper
on
you,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
i
have
not
found
any
thing.
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
not
show
that
united
was
using
a
different
standard?
unknown
speaker
because
you
cannot
go
to
trial.
