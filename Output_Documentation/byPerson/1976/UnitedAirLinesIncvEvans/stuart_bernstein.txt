mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
alright
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965.
it’s
primarily
concern
is
the
regard
if
any
to
be
paid
to
a
prior
time-barred
discriminatory
act
and
the
application
of
a
current,
neutral,
nondiscriminatory
seniority
system.
united
air
lines
like
other
domestic
air
carriers
in
the
united
states
up
until
november
of
1968
maintained
a
policy
which
required
that
its
stewardesses,
now
called
flight
attendants,
be
and
remain
unmarried
and
that
in
november
1968,
they
entered
an
agreement
with
the
air
line
pilots
association,
the
collective
bargaining
agent
for
the
flight
attendants
abrogating
this
rule,
offering
reinstatements
to
those
who
have
been
terminated
and
who
have
protested
through
company
or
federal
or
state
agencies
to
effect
with
the
discharge.
reinstatement
was
offered
without
back
pay.
that
policy
was
ultimately
in
case
of
sprogis
v.
united
air
lines
in
the
seventh
circuit
to
be
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
in
violation
of
title
vii.
in
february
1968,
miss
evans
the
respondent
here
resigned
upon
marriage.
she
claims
that
it
was
involuntary
that
she
was
forced
to
resign
and
since
this
arises
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
is
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
at
the
time
of
her
discharge,
title
vii
provided
that
a
charge
claiming
a
violation
of
the
act
had
to
be
filed
with
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
within
90
days
of
the
event.
it's
conceded
that
miss
evans
did
not
file
such
a
charge
within
that
time
limit
and
in
fact
did
nothing
with
respect
to
that
for
a
period
of
four
years.
in
february
of
1972,
she
applied
to
united
air
lines
for
pre-employment
as
a
stewardess
and
in
fact
was
hired
as
a
new
employee
at
that
time.
she
was
sent
to
training
school
along
with
other
new
employees,
finished
the
training
a
month
later
and
in
march
1972
was
assigned
to
the
line
to
assume
the
duties
of
a
flight
attendant.
at
that
time
as
your
court
may
know
it
had
already
been
decided
that
the
limitation
of
their
position
to
members
of
the
female
sex
only
was
a
violation
and
the
job
had
been
opened
up
to
males
as
well
as
females.
she
worked
as
a
stewardess
as
a
flight
attendant
from
march
1972
upon
completion
of
training
till
february
1973
at
which
time
she
filed
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunities
commission
in
which
she
alleged
that
it
a
was
violation
of
the
act
for
united
to
have
refused
to
credit
her
with
seniority
for
her
earlier
employment
which
ended
in
the
1968,
when
they
designed
her
seniority
on
rehire
in
1972.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
only
it
has
done
so
your
honor
as
when
charges
have
been
filed
within
the
time
limits
that
is
they
have
done
a
number
of
instances
where
the
stewardesses
have
complained
within
appropriate
time
limits
about
their
termination
have
been
reinstated
with
full
seniority,
that
is
different
situation.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
pardon
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that’s
correct.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
the
contrary.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that’s
correct.
there
is
a
period
upon
after
termination
which
seniority
is
lost,
discharge
under
these
circumstances
it's
lost
immediately.
she
received
in
due
course
the
permission,
the
right
to
sue
letter
from
the
eeoc
and
suit
was
filed
in
september
1974.
the
united
answered
and
i
will
allude
to
this
later,
in
its
answer,
it
admitted
that
the
termination
had
been
by
resignation,
but
denied
the
allegation
that
had
been
involuntary.
it
also
added
as
affirmative
defense
at
the
time
issue
and
then
raised
that
by
motion
to
dismiss.
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
continuing
violation,
that
the
act
of
the
termination
assuming
to
be
discriminatory
was
completed
long
ago,
the
90-day
limit
had
run
on
that
and
that
it
was
not
continuing,
consistent
with
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts,
i
don’t
think
that
is
an
issue
here
as
to
whether
or
not
a
discharge
is
impleaded
that
not
continuing
and
held
that
what
she
was
really
trying
to
do
in
this
case
was
to
reassert
a
claim
which
had
been
time
bargaining
mainly
the
1968
termination
of
employment.
matter
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
interim
the
case
collins
v.
united
air
lines
have
been
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
a
similarly
situated
former
united
stewardess
who
applied
for
reinstatements
after
four
years
of
unemployment,
didn’t
stay
the
claim
against
the
company
because
there
was
continuing
violation,
held
there
was
no
obligation
to
rehire.
when
the
seventh
circuit
first
was
faced
with
evans
case
on
appeal,
it
determined
consistent
with
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action,
no
continuing
violation,
action
was
based
on
the
time
barred
act
and
saw
no
difference
between
the
situation
before
it
because
united
had
voluntarily
rehired
ms.
evans
than
the
situation
in
the
ninth
circuit
were
united
had
refused
to
reinstatement
mrs.
collins
and
so
the
result
should
be
same
in
the
event
and
dismissed
and
affirmed
the
dismissal
by
the
district
court.
it
noted
if
the
rule
should
be
otherwise,
employer
such
as
united
airlines
would
have
the
temptation
not
to
rehire
employees
who
otherwise
would
be
rehirable
because
you
get
into
this
upon
doing
so
and
the
situation
should
not
be
the
same.
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed
and
pending
the
determination
on
the
ruling
on
the
petition
this
court
issued
its
decision
of
franks
v.
bowman
transportation
company.
the
court
of
appeals
there
upon
granted
the
petition
and
on
rehearing
reversed
itself
without
reference
at
all
collins
for
the
problem
that
time
barred
first
event
and
says
that
under
franks
v.
bowman,
the
relief
requested
could
be
granted.
obliviously,
franks
v.
bowman
has
some
significance
to
our
position
here
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
that
briefly.
franks
did
not
involve
as
this
case
did,
the
question
of
a
time
barred
claim.
in
franks,
the
issue
was
whether
the
court
having
informed
that
there
was
a
discriminatory
act
within
the
time
limits
by
the
way,
that
a
permissible
form
of
relief
under
section
706(g)
of
the
civil
rights
act
was
to
accord
retroactive
seniority
and
in
that
instance
it
would
have
been
seniority
from
the
date
that
the
black
africans
who
have
been
discriminatorily
refused
employment
as
over
the
road
drivers
with
bowman
transport,
when
they
were
hired,
they
could
get
credit,
seniority
credit
back
to
the
time
of
first
application.
in
that
case,
the
charge
had
been
filed
in
february
of
1970.
the
record
in
this
case,
the
opinions
themselves
examine
your
opinion
and
the
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
clear
that
there
were
200,
it
was
a
class
action
incidentally,
there
were
206
africans
concerned
in
that
case,
all
who
had
applied
for
employment
after
january
1,
1970.
they
are
simply
could
not
have
been
a
time
limit
question
in
that
case;
none
was
ever
raised
in
this
court.
what
the
court
held
was
--
that
the
fact
that
the
703(h)
of
the
civil
rights
act
said
that
a
bona
fide
seniority
system
itself
could
not
be
the
basis
of
finding
of
a
violation,
did
not
preclude
the
granting
as
a
element
of
remedy
under
706(g)
the
remedial
section
to
the
act
retroactive
seniority,
but
that
would
not
stand
in
the
way.
so,
the
franks
v.
bowman
presupposed
the
proof
of
a
discriminatory
act
within
the
time
limit
and
concerned
itself
only
with
the
application
of
remedy.
the
fact
is
there
was
a
time
limit
problem
in
franks,
but
that
had
been
disposed
off
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
never
reached
this
court.
well,
the
courts
in
evans
too,
the
supreme
court
interpreted
that
to
me
that
the
fact
that
a
remedy
was
available,
a
retroactive
seniority
under
706(g)
made
united’s
refusal
or
failure
to
accord
seniority
for
the
prior
employment
an
offence
under
703(h).
now,
united
has
never
raised
703(h)
as
a
defense.
its
defense
simply
was
you
can’t
prove
a
claim
within
the
time
limits
provided
by
the
civil
rights
act.
we
never
get
to
the
question
of
the
remedy.
you
don’t
talk
about
remedy
until
you
have
proved
the
violation
and
none
have
been
proved.
well,
the
court
had
made
up
the
argument
for
us.
it
said
the
united’s
argument
appears
to
rest
substantial
on
703(h)
and
the
supreme
court
disposed
of
that
in
franks.
i
submit
to
you
your
honor
that
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
franks
and
evans
too
is
misleading
of
franks,
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
whatsoever.
in
fact,
the
naacp
which
has
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
support
of
respondent
concedes
that.
that
franks
was
not
a
case
involving
time
limits,
it
really
does
not
reach
the
issue.
we,
therefore,
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
in
error.
we
have
a
simple
situation
here.
when
act
occurred,
action
was
not
taken
within
the
prescribed
time.
that
act
is
gone.
though
it
was
a
pre-act
violation,
a
post
act
violation
on
which
such
statute
is
run
there
is
no
different
posture
than
a
pre-act
violation.
this
is
our
basic
position.
now,
there
is
one
other
line
of
cases
that
have
been
cited
by
counsel
for
respondents
to
support
the
position.
these
are
the
so
called
departmental
seniority
cases
typified
by
united
paper
workers
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
and
the
district
court
of
virginia
which
are
the
leading
cases
in
this
direction.
it
may
well
be
that
those
cases
will
stands
from
review.
after
your
honors
have
finish
consideration
of
the
time
case
and
east
texas
motor
freight
case
which
are
now
pending
before
you,
where
some
challenges
made
through
the
departmental
seniority
cases.
but
many
of
them,
the
departmental
seniority
cases
have
no
application
here
because
the
theory
there
is
that
a
freshly
neutral
seniority
system
is
in
fact
discriminatory
because
it
requires
that
seniority
be
exercised
on
the
basis
of
seniority
credits
which
employees
were
prohibited
from
gaining
because
of
prior
unlawful
practices.
so,
although
it
appears
at
that
the
black
employees
in
the
paper
makers
for
example
could
bid
into
lines
of
progression
formally
held
by
white
employees
and
whites
could
equally
did
it
for
black
positions,
yet
no
white
would
ever
been
in
black
position
because
they
were
the
lower
rated
positions,
lower
paying
positions
and
since
you
have
to
bid
it
on
the
basis
of
departmental
seniority
in
order
to
move
up
into
a
higher
paying
job
you
have
to
sacrifice
your
just
in
seniority.
i
think
that’s
an
entirely
different
question.
the
point
there
is
that
the
courts
have
found
that
that
seniority
system
is
at
that
time
a
discriminatory
act.
the
system
is
discriminatory.
now,
they
say,
there
are
some
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
their
position
is
viable,
but
however,
this
court
may
resolve
the
issues
before
in
the
over
the
road
cases
that
you
have
under
consideration
doesn’t
reach
the
point
here.
now,
one
way
to
bring
this
to
a
focus
to
show
that
inevitably
respondent
cannot
prevail
unless
reliance
is
placed
on
the
time-barred
1968
act,
its
look
the
way
this
matter
arose,
certainly
at
the
state
of
the
pleadings.
as
i
said,
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
pleadings
that
the
termination
was
involuntary
and
was
forced
by
united
airlines.
we
have
admitted
only
that
there
was
a
resignation.
it
would
not
be
an
illegal
act,
not
be
of
violation
to
act
of
any
time
and
had
an
employee
voluntarily
resigned
upon
being
married,
will
be
no
longer
have
the
rule
and
many
stewardesses
and
flight
attendants
still
do
resign
upon
getting
married.
the
percentage
is
not
the
same
but
it's
certainly
not
rare,
they
are
numbered
in
the
hundreds.
there
are
still
circumstances
in
which
marriage,
a
woman
who
withdraws
herself
from
the
job
market
upon
becoming
married.
so,
the
mere
fact
that
resignation
wouldn’t
be
sufficient.
if
this
were
to
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
for
trial,
since
it
stands
on
answer
denying
it,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
the
respondents
to
prove,
in
fact,
that
the
resignation
had
been
involuntarily.
in
other
words,
there
in
fact
had
been
a
violation
of
the
act
but
that
would
require
proof
of
a
1968
time-barred
claim
in
order
to
sustain
the
position
here.
now,
this
brings
us
around
to
machinists
v.
national
labor
relations
board,
the
decision
arising
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
there’s
court
seven
franks
case
itself,
analogy
to
that
statute
are
extremely
helpful
in
applying
the
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
right
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
situation
is
that
since
we
have
to
raise
this
as
a
motion
of
dismiss.
we
have
admitted
all
well
pleaded.
she
has
pleaded
that
it
was
involuntary
enforced
so
we
have
admitted
that
for
this
purpose.
our
position
is
it's
irrelevant.
whether
it
was
an
illegal
discriminatory
act
or
not
in
1968,
our
point
is
whatever
it
was
at
that’s
time-barred.
you
can’t
enter
into
that.
if
this
matter
should
be
tried
since
we
have
denied
it
in
our
answer
in
motion
to
dismiss,
it's
not
sufficient
try
to
win
or
if
we
lose
on
that.
she
has
to
go
back
and
prove
her
case
and
then
she
would
be
put
on
her
proof
as
to
the
nature
of
her
act
whether
it
was
voluntary
or
involuntary.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that’s
correct
sir,
but
the
point
is
not
the
burden
as
much
as
is
that,
that
must
be
proved
at
that
point
and
she
must
rely
then
on
a
1968
time
barred
act
in
order
to
assert
the
point
that
an
application
of
a
seniority
system
in
1972,
she
should
have
been
given
credit
for
that
service
which
ended
in
1968.
if
i,
may
i
would
like
to
allude
to
the
machinists
v
national
labor
relations
board
case.
that
was
in
1960
case
and
arose
under
10(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
is
the
analog
of
section
703(d)
of
the
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
in
that
it
provides
that
charges
be
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
within
six
months
of
the
alleged
unfair
unlawful
labor
practice
and
under
title
vii,
it's
the
unlawful
employment
practice,
again
now
a
six
month
of
period.
there
the
issue
was
what
effect
will
be
given
to
a
pre
10(b),
a
pre-six
month
incident
to
cast
light
on
an
event
occurring
within
the
10(b)
period.
in
that
case,
an
illegal
union
security
clause
has
been
entered
into
through
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
was
illegal
because
at
that
time
the
union
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
and
in
order
to
entered
into
it
union
security
clause,
the
union
must
be
the
majority
representative.
contract
was
entered
into
and
of
course,
since
there
was
a
union
security
clause,
employees
had
to
joined
the
union,
so
that
the
very
soon
the
union
had
a
majority
by
operation
of
the
clause.
more
than
six
months
after,
the
execution
of
the
contract,
but
within
the
period
of
it's
enforcement,
a
charge
was
brought
against
the
employer
and
union
alleging
that
this
was
an
unlawful
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
matter
came
before
this
court
and
it
was
held
that
since
the
contract
on
it's
face
was
completely
lawful,
legal
agreement
and
its
illegality
if
any
could
only
be
established
by
proof
of
what
had
happened
at
the
execution
of
the
contract
more
than
six
months
earlier,
that
such
evidence
was
not
admissible
to
prove
the
violation
within
the
limitations
period
and
the
national
relations
board
decision
holding
that
in
fact
such
evidence
could
be
adduced
was
reversed.
now,
we
submit
your
honor,
we
have
the
same
situation
here.
there
is
simply
no
way
that
a
respondent
can
make
out
it's
assertion
here
that
united
failed
to
credit
her
with
seniority,
earned
up
to
1968,
in
it's
present
application
of
it's
neutral,
nondiscriminatory
time
in
the
position
seniority
system
which
the
company
now
has,
unless
that
is
proved.
because
this
respondent
in
1972
was
no
different
position
than
a
new
employee
who
had
never
worked
for
the
company
or
an
employee
who
had
quit
clearly
on
the
voluntarily
basis
four
years
ago
or
an
employee
who
had
fired
for
cause
or
theft
and
then
been
rehired
four
years
later.
in
none
of
those
instances,
would
it
be
suggested
that
employee
was
entitled
or
any
of
these
employees
were
entitled
any
prior
seniority
and
the
only
distinction
you
can
make
among
those
groups
and
the
respondent
here
is
that
in
fact
that
she
worked
for
united
up
to
1968
and
was
terminated
under
this
no
marriage
policy,
a
claim
which
is
time
barred.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
sir,
i
think
it
goes
to
both
points.
the
case
that
the
court
did
discuss
the
concept
of
a
continuing
violation
in
that
case
and
it
said
that
if
in
fact
we
were
to
follow
the
theory
of
the
board,
the
labor
board
in
that
instance
the
violation
would
never
end.
as
here,
respondent
could
have
waited
20-30
years
and
come
in
and
said
well
back
in
1972,
he
gave
me
the
seniority
i
was
entitled
to,
and
therefore,
it's
a
continuing
violation.
it
went
to
that
point
as
well
as
to
the
point
as
when
did
the
initial
event
occurred
which
started
the
statute
to
run
and
they
held
that
was
the
execution
of
the
contract.
since,
that
time
there
was
no
present
defense.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
argument,
the
point
is
however
your
honor
is
about
the
seniority
violation
is
that
unless
you
rely
on
a
time
barred
claim.
the
1968
claim,
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
the
present
seniority
system.
in
fact,
the
system
is
not
the
attacked.
it
is
the
failure,
it's
put
in
terms
of
practice,
it
said
that
we
follow
a
practice
of
not
giving
her
credit
for
her
prior
employment
and
the
point
is
that
the
prior
employment
ended
four
years
earlier,
long
beyond
the
termination
of
the
statutory
period.
your
honor,
i
am
responding
to
your
question
i….
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
concept
of
the
continuing
violation
i
think
was
laid
to
rest
both
in
iue
v.
robbins
&
myers
earlier
this
term
and
in
johnson
v.
railway
express
where
time
limit
questions
were
raised,
one
under
1981
and
one
under
title
vii
and
the
court
made
clear
that
the
act
of
the
discharge
is
the
completed
act
and
the
time
limits
begins
to
run
from
that
date.
there
is
no
continuing
concept
in
there
and
i
submit
that
the
courts
of
appeal
are
uniform
on
that
the
eight
circuit
and
fourth
circuit,
even
the
seventh
circuit
agrees
with
that
and
evans
won,
which
was
two
to
one
decision,
even
in
dissent
judge
cumming
said
that
we
agree
that
there
was
no
obligation
to
rehire,
there
is
no
continuing
violation.
unless
respondent
can
show
that
somehow
he
can
assert
the
possession
that
he
can
sustain
his
position
without
reliance
on
a
time
barred
act.
that
seems
to
me
that
it’d
be
rather
a
clear
case,
i
apologize
for
saying
that,
the
clear
cases
don’t
get
up
here,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
its
crystal
clear,
if
the
time
limits
mean
anything
in
title
vii
that
it
must
foreclose
the
claim
here.
i
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
the
point
that
you
just
made
concerning
the
disincentive
to
hire
was
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
evans
one,
it
seems
to
concern
it
very
much,
although
it
completely
ignored
it
in
evans
two.
the
same
point
has
disturbed
the
district
court
in
california
last
year
in
the
case
in
which
it
attempted
to
reconcile,
collins
and
evans
and
expressed
some
concern
about
that
dichotomy
now
between
these
cases
that
it
was
perfectly
alright
not
to
rehire,
but
once
you
did,
you
ran
into
this
host
of
problems
that
have
been
raised
here.
that
was
kennan
v.
pan-am
cited
in
the
briefs.
i
wish
to
respond
very
briefly
to
some
of
the
points
made.
we
agree
there
can
be
a
continuing
violation,
no
question
about
that
and
we
agree
if
there
is
a
continuing
violation
that
the
statute
now
provides
as
a
result
of
the
1972
amendments,
that
there
can
be
a
two-year
period
of
back
pay,
but
that
two-year
period
is
a
limitation
of
liability,
not
a
statute
of
limitations
point.
up
to
that
point,
the
limitations
for
back
pay
was
drawn
from
the
various
state
laws
as
it
is
now
under
section
1981
of
the
earlier
civil
rights
act
and
it
was
to
make
uniform.
a
back
pay
period
that
the
1972
amendments
were
passed,
and
griggs
is
a
good
example
of
a
continuing
violation
where
the
employer
at
the
time
of
the
litigation
required
a
passage
of
a
one
electic
test
and
the
maintenance
of
the
high
school
diploma
in
order
to
progress
into
higher
paying
jobs.
that
was
going
on,
the
aborted
attempt
to
justify
that
and
this
court
said
that
it
had
a
dispirit
affect
now
and
therefore
was
now
a
discriminatory
even
though
facially
neutral
because
the
requirements
for
the
test
and
the
diploma
were
required
of
blacks
as
well
as
whites.
it
was
neutral
than
discriminate,
the
fact
is
that
the
blacks
could
more
readily
--
the
whites
could
more
readily
meet
the
requirement
than
the
blacks
and
was
therefore
held
to
be
now
a
discrimination
and
a
continuing
discrimination.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
there
is
no
contention
here.
there
never
has
been.
that
the
united
seniority
system
which
is
based
on
date
of
hire
is
discriminatory
in
any
way
with
respect
to
race,
sex
or
any
other
matter,
in
fact
i
think
that
has
been
completely
conceded
all
along.
united
seniority
system
has
not
been
challenged.
the
thesis
stated
in
respondent’s
brief
on
page
14
is
this.
by
relying
on
the
1968
termination,
as
creating
a
break
in
service
and
giving
affect
to
that
break
in
service
in
its
current
seniority
practice
with
respect
to
ms.
evans,
united
is
actively
enabling
that
prior
discrimination
to
reach
effectively
into
the
present.
it
says
we
are
treating
it
as
a
break
in
service.
yes
we
are,
we
concede.
that
is
exactly
what
it
was,
it
was
a
break
in
service
and
it
would
be
a
break
in
service
for
any
employee,
no
matter
how
that
break
occurred.
but
the
fact
that
we
do
not
give
credit
for
that
break
in
service
in
1972
does
not
create
a
present
discriminatory
act,
as
counsel
insists,
it
is
inevitable.
there
is
no
way
you
can
get
to
this
point
without
relying
on
a
time
barred
claim
and
united
is
sensitive
to
the
problems
of
the
civil
rights
movement
as
its
counsel
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
to
defend
ourselves
here.
we
concede
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
that
the
no
marriage
rule
was
a
violation,
up
until
1968
when
we
abandoned
it
and
we
concede
that
if
ms.
evans
had
filed
the
charge
within
90
days
of
her
termination.
she
should
have
been
back
working
long
ago
with
full
seniority
and…
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
am
sorry,
i
think
i
would
have
to
ask
you
to
qualify
the
question
a
bit.
if
you
assume
the
employee
was
discharged
for
theft
and
it
find
that
they
filed
a
timely
grievance.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
then
sir
united
would
have
had
no
obligation.
if
in
fact
they
did,
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
a
different
complaint
would
have
to
be
filed
and
if
counsel
can
bring
up
such
examples,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir,
yes
it
would,
but
i
submit
to
you,
that
is
not
this
case,
i
responded
to
justice
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
am
sorry,
in
this
case
i
cannot
go
to
trial.
let
us
suppose
this
your
honor,
let
us
suppose
we
had
a
system
in
which
for
all
employees
who
voluntarily
quit.
we
would
permit
them
to
return
four
years
later
and
give
them
full
seniority
credit
for
past
service,
but
we
would
not
do
the
same
thing
for
employees
who
had
been
terminated
because
of
the
“no
marriage”
rule.
i
think
you
can
make
out
a
different
case,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
you
would
say
then
our
present
practice,
our
present
seniority
system
is
discriminatory
because
it
grants
the
seniority
on
a
different
basis
to
employees
whose
only
differentiation
is
prior
discrimination.
i
would
concede
that
is
the
kind
of
case
that
is
typified
by
united
paper
makers.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
if
such
a
case
exists
i
suggest
the
counsel
bring
a
new
cause
of
action
against
us,
but
that
is
not
what
has
being
tried
here,
that
is
not
the
issue
at
all.
a
counsel
says
that
the
machinists
can
be
distinguished
because
of
the
historical
context
in
which
it
arose,
the
congeniality
for
collective
bargain
agreements,
the
desire
to
stabilize
labor
relations.
the
fact
is
that
in
that
case
this
court
cited
with
approval
an
nlrb
case
bowman
by
name,
the
citation
of
which
is
113
nlrb
731,
i
have
1975
in
my
notes,
but
i
am
sure
it
was,
must
have
been
1955
and
cited
with
approval
by
the
court
in
machinists
that
was
a
seniority
case.
there
an
employee
who
had
been
on
layoff,
on
return
from
layoff
was
given
less
seniority
than
he
was
entitled
to
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
some
conspiracy
between
the
union
and
the
company
because
he
had
occupied
the
supervisory
job
in
the
meantime.
so
he
was
in
a
lower
seniority
slot.
well,
six
months
after
he
came
back,
there
was
a
layoff
and
because
of
his
low
seniority,
relative
low
seniority
because
of
what
happened
when
he
came
on
board,
he
was
laid
off
earlier
than
he
would
have
otherwise
been
and
at
that
time
he
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
and
the
board
held
it
was
time
barred
because
the
event
that
caused
that
situation
occurred
when
they
failed
to
give
him
the
seniority
to
which
he
was
entitled
and
there
the
same
point
was
made
that
if
otherwise
this
can
go
on
for
ten,
20
30
years
indefinitely
and
you
simply
read
section
10
(b)
out
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
just
as
you
had
read
out
section
706
(e)
out
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
your
honor,
our
thesis
is
a
very
simple
one.
there
is
no
way
that
the
case
can
be
made
out
here
without
reliance
on
the
time
barred
event
and
the
statute
limitations
sort
to
of
be
mean
anything
then
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
in
district
courts
opinion,
reinstated.
thank
you
very
much.
