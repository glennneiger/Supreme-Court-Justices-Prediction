mr.
alan
m.
levin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
allen
m.
levin.
i
am
with
the
chicago
law
firm
of
dorfman,
dekoven,
cohen
&
laner
and
i
represent
the
respondent
carolyn
evans.
i
would
like
to
note
in
passing
before
proceeding
to
argument
that
in
the
first
place
we
have
not
yet
had
a
trial
in
this
case.
there
has
been
no
proof
taken
on
whether
or
not
united
applies
continuous
time
and
service
across
the
board.
i
personally
had
met
an
individual
flight
attendant
with
the
united
who
had
not
discriminated
against
by
the
no
marriage
rule,
who
did
quit,
who
was
rehired
and
was
given
past
service
credit.
now,
i
am
not
accusing
mr.
bernstein
of
lying
or
anything
like
that
i
am
only
suggesting….
mr.
alan
m.
levin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
oh
excuse
me
your
honor.
by
way
of
argument,
mrs.
evans’
case
can
be
summarized
in
a
nutshell
as
consisting
of
two
points.
first
that
her
charge
was
timely
because
it
was
filed
during
the
pendency
of
the
employment
practice
which
she
is
challenging,
namely
united’s
practice
with
respect
to
her
seniority,
whereby
they
deny
her
credit
for
any
time
worked
before
1972.
secondly,
that
united’s
practice
with
respect
to
her
seniority
is
illegal
because
it
gives
present
vitality
to
united’s
past,
open,
admitted,
across
the
board
pattern
and
practice
discrimination
of
which
carolyn
evans
is
an
identifiable
victim.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
not
one
of
time
limits.
at
every
stage
of
this
case
we
have
conceded
and
we
concede
again
that
if
carolyn
evans
was
solely
and
simply
attacking
the
1968
termination.
her
only
affective
avenue
of
relief
would
be
by
way
of
success
in
mcdonald
litigation
as
class
member
in
mcdonald.
she
is
not
seeking
the
back
pay
or
other
monetary
relief
for
the
period
1968
to
1972.
that’s
the
penalty
she
suffered
for
not
filing
her
charge
within
90
days
of
the
1968
termination.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
as
for
1968
to
1972
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
you
are
referring
to
collins
case,
i
assume
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
reinstatement
of
employment
or
of
seniority
your
honor?
mr.
alan
m.
levin
oh
that’s
a
different
case
i
believe
that
if….
mr.
alan
m.
levin
it
could
be
different
potentially.
if
it
could
be
shown
that
united’s
refusal
to
rehire
would
have
been
based
or
was
in
fact
based
upon
prior
discrimination,
in
other
words,
united
said
because
we
discriminated
against
you
in
the
past,
we
are
not
going
to
hire….
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well
i
think
they
would
different
case
then
and
i
think
that…
mr.
alan
m.
levin
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
as
the
matter
of
fact
for
four
years
until
she
was
rehired,
she
made
several
efforts
to
be
rehired
and
was
turned
down;
she
was
not
represented
by
the
counsel.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
yes,
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
the
way
you
have
posted
the
facts,
it
would
be
different
from
our
case
and
i
do
not
believe
the
client
could
be
(inaudible)
unless
the
continuing
pattern
could
be
shown.
in
the
facts
as
you
stated
them
i
do
not
see
a
continuing
pattern.
we
are
dealing
here
with
seniority
which
is
a
special
kind
of
an
animal,
a
special
kind
of
an
employment
animal.
it
is
based
upon
the
past.
it
necessarily
looks
to
the
past.
it
operates
in
the
present.
it
looks
to
the
future
as
well
and
operates
in
the
future.
we
are
talking
about
an
on
the
job
policy.
we
are
not
necessarily
stating
that
an
employer
has
an
obligation
to
rehire
a
past
discriminitree,
but
we
are
saying
that
an
employer
once
he
hires
somebody,
has
to
hire
has
to
treat
that
person
with
fairness
and
not
get
present
vitality
to
the
past
discrimination.
i
think
the
best
analogy
i
can
give
would
be
under
the
wage
and
hour
law.
if
an
employer
says
to
a
perspective
applicant,
i
am
not
going
to
hire
you
because
i
can
only
afford
to
pay
you
$19
an
hour
and
the
employee
says
well
that
is
40
cents
below
the
minimum
wage
and
runs
down
to
his
nearest
regional
office
of
the
us
department
of
labor
and
files
a
claim,
he
is
going
to
be
tell
the
employment
has
no
obligation
to
hire
him.
but
once
the
employer
hires
him,
suppose
the
employee
agrees
to
work
for
$19,
the
employer
says
fine,
he
hires
him
and
next
day
the
employee
can
go
down
to
the
us
department
of
labor
to
file
a
claim
and
the
employer
will
be
told
that
there
is
no
such
waiver
in
that
case,
that
once
you
hired
the
man,
you
have
the
obligation
to
pay
him
legal
minimum
wage.
we
have
an
analogous
claim
here.
once
united
rehired
carolyn
evans,
it
could
not
treat
her
like
a
stranger
because
she
was
in
fact
no
stranger.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
suspect
that
it
is
the
very
rare
employer
indeed
who
rehires
an
employ
who
was
previously
been
discharged
for
discriminatory
reasons,
unless
he
is
ordered
by
court
to
do
so.
carolyn
evans
was
not
hired
out
of
goodness
of
united’s
heart.
united
got
an
experienced,
mature
employee
who
is
better
than
the
average
crop
of
employees
coming
around.
presumably
that
is
the
reason
that
she
was
rehired.
secondly
it
is
possible
to
posit
a
case,
unlike
the
collins
case
where
the
employee
can
demonstrate
that
the
refusal
to
rehire
was
in
fact
based
upon
the
fact
that
employee
was
a
past
discriminatory,
that
is
not
the
collins
case
that
would
be
closer
to
our
case.
even
today
as
carolyn
evans
flies
for
united
airlines,
she
suffers
a
current
loss
of
benefits,
a
loss
of
wages,
a
loss
in
vacations;
she
suffers
a
loss
in
the
area
of
flight
assignment
selections,
right
to
retention
in
the
case
of
layoff
because
of
united’s
current
practice
with
respect
to
her
seniority.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
she
were
to
file
today,
it
would
be
our
contention
that
she
still
the
time-limit,
but
section
706(g)
of
the
act
places
a
two-year
limitation
on
back
pay
recovery.
so
that
in
the
terms
of
financial
recovery
whenever
she
were
to
file
the
claim,
she
would
be
limited
to
two
years
of
back
pay.
furthermore,
if
unlike
this
case,
where
united
has
not
once
claimed
that
it
has
been
prejudiced
by
the
times
delay,
united
argues
about
claims
in
the
future,
not
about
this
case,
but
if
in
the
future
an
employee
can
demonstrate
actual
prejudice
in
defense
on
the
merits
then
conceivably
the
court
can
apply
the
doctrine
of
latches.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
in
this
case
that
congress
has
not
barred
this
claim
with
the
time
limitations
at
706(e).
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well,
i
believe
this
would
be
similar
to
the
veteran’s
reemployment
cases
where
while
there
was
a
one-year
statutory
protection
period,
the
courts
have
traditionally
applied
the
doctrine
of
latches
to
bar
claims
which
are
deemed
to
be
stale
of
evidentiary
reasons
and
that
essentially
is
the
argument
which
is
being
made
by
the
company
in
this
case.
carolyn
evans
also
suffers
from
a
present
sexual
disparity
on
the
job.
she
is
perpetually
subordinated
to
where
she
would
have
been,
had
she
been
a
married
male
flight
attendant.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
to
the
extent
of
18
months
also
to
the
extent
of
four
years
1968
to
1972.
i
realize
that
on
equitable
grounds,
the
claim
for
the
18
months
actually
worked
is
more
compelling
than
the
four
years
that
were
not
worked.
on
the
other
hand
it
is
no
less
true
that
the
present
denial
with
seniority
does
in
fact
give
vitality
to
the
past
discrimination,
today
it
is
for
the
denial
on
the
four
years
as
well.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
i
am
not
aware
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
carolyn
evans
complains
of
a
current
sexual
disparity
and
a
recurrent
loss.
her
charge
was
timely
when
judged
by
these
standards
in
the
legislative
history
when
congress
considered
amendments
to
the
title
vii
in
1972.
specifically
congress
stated
that
it
was
accepting
the
judicially
created
doctrine
that
certain
violations
are
deemed
to
be
continuing
in
nature
that
a
charge
is
timely
when
filed
during
the
pendency
there
off
or
at
any
time
up
to
180
days
after
the
last
recurrence
of
the
practice.
in
addition,
you
have
to
couple
that
with
section
706(g)
act
which
limits
back
pay
relief
to
two
years,
which
would
have
significance
only
in
a
continuing
violation
case
and
to
refer
again
to
the
veteran’s
reemployment
cases
this
court
in
1949
in
the
oakley
case
and
the
hans
case
at
338
u.s.
278,
two
1949
decisions
recognized
on
the
escalator
theory
of
seniority
that
a
veteran
could
raise
a
claim
for
denial
of
seniority
credit
from
his
original
date
of
hire
even
after
the
one
year
statutory
protection
period
had
run.
there
is
no
time
limit
issue
in
this
case,
her
charge
was
timely.
united
has
never
disputed
the
fact
that
the
challenge
seniority
practice
is
a
current
one.
it's
never
disputed
that
the
seniority
practice
itself
is
a
continuing
one.
it's
never
really
disputed
the
preposition
that
if
the
seniority
practice
is
illegal
then
the
charge
was
timely.
united
had
never
alleged
prejudice
against
them
on
their
ability
to
defend
on
the
merits.
in
saying
that
the
only
violation
that
occurred
in
this
case
occurred
in
1968,
united
is
really
saying
that
the
statute
of
limitation
should
be
held
to
or
run
before
the
violation
was
even
committed.
the
violation
challenged
in
this
case
didn’t
even
begin
to
occur
until
after
carolyn
evans
was
rehired
in
1972.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
referring
to
this
specific
current
practice
which
she
is
challenging,
the
practice
with
respect
to
her
seniority.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that,
that
practice
is
illegal
because
it
gives
present
vitality
to
perpetuate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
against
her
in
1968.
now,
united
air
lines
is
openly
relying
on
that
past
act
of
discrimination,
an
open
admitted
policy
across
the
board,
pattern
or
practice
adjudicated
to
be
illegal
in
the
sprogis
case.
as
creating
and
break
in
service
to
deprive
carolyn
evans
of
benefits
and
seniority
today
and
then
they
tell
us
that
we
are
time
barred.
we
submit
that
it
is
a
basic
established
accepted
principle
of
the
title
vii
law,
it
has
been
for
at
least
last
nine
years,
from
this
court
for
six
years
that
united
can
not
be
permitted
to
perpetuate
the
effects
past
discrimination
through
it's
current
practice.
the
principle
we
rely
on
is
as
follows.
that
where
a
present
employment
practice
characteristically
is
a
seniority
practice
which
is
so,
characteristically
tied
to
the
past,
operates
in
the
present,
looks
to
the
future
where
such
a
practice
to
use
united’s
words
is
inextricably
tied
to
and
painted
by
past
discrimination
as
they
say
was
true
in
the
papermaker’s
case
and
where
that
present
practice
extends
and
perpetuates
the
past
discrimination
into
the
present
resulting
in
loss
and
disadvantage
to
the
identifiable
victim
of
that
past
discrimination
in
the
present
then
we
say
that
the
present
practice
is
illegal.
eoc
said
this
several
years
ago.
eight
courts
of
appeal
have
agreed
with
the
principle
in
the
seniority
area.
congress
recognized
the
principles
when
it
sighted
the
papermaker’s
case
with
approval
in
considering
amendments
to
title
vii
in
1972.
this
court
recognized
the
principle
that
present
facially
fair
employment
practices
that
perpetuate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
are
illegal
in
the
griggs
case,
in
1971.
we
submit
that,
that
principle
fits
the
evans
case
like
a
glove.
she
is
the
identifiable
victim
of
past
open
adjudicated
discrimination.
she
suffers
today
due
to
a
current
superficially
neutral
but
no
less
damaging
policy
which
gives
present
vitality
to
that
past
discrimination.
every
time
carolyn
evan
bids
on
a
flight
assignment,
every
time
she
takes
a
vacation,
every
time
she
gets
her
pay
check,
every
time
she
has
to
stand
at
an
airport
waiting
to
see
if
she
is
going
to
fly
on
standby...
mr.
alan
m.
levin
she
could
under
that
theory.
it
isn’t
necessary
for
the
court
to
hold
that
to
be
the
case
mr.
justice
stevens,
she
could.
well,
in
this
case
our
contention
includes
the
fact
that
the
carolyn
evan
has
actually
worked
for
united
air
lines
from
1966
to
1968
and
that…
and
that
she
earned
service
as
the
past
employee.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
yes
she
was
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well,
the
second
half
of
my
answer
was
going
to
be
that
i
believe
that
she
should
be
entitled
to
relief.
i
was
going
to
suggest
the
possible
distinction.
i
believe
she
should
get
relief
and
this
in
fact
the
ache(ph)
case,
which
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit,
the
new
york
city
police
won
the
case.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
exactly
mr.
justice
stevens
and
we
are
going
for
both
constructive
and
actual
seniority.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
that
she
has
been
legally
fired
and
that
through
its
present
action
united
gets
present
effect
to
that
past
discrimination.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
solely,
for
that
which
she
lost
because
of
1968
discrimination
that
is
true.
on
the
other
hand,
nobody
twisted
united
airlines’
arm
and
told
them
to
ignore
carolyn
evan’s
seniority
from
1966
to
1968.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
that
is
true.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
yes
i
am
and
i
will
do
so
now
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
machinists
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
this
one
on
three
grounds;
statutory
policy,
the
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history.
first
let
us
take
a
look
at
the
machinists
case.
it
was
decided
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
1960
around
the
time
of
steel
workers
trilogy
decided
by
this
court.
at
that
time,
as
mr.
justice
harlyn
expressly
stated
in
his
opinion,
i
refer
to
362
u.s.
428.
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
being
viewed
in
the
context
of
that
case
is
primarily
a
regulatory
statute.
the
chief
concern
in
that
opinion
was
institutional
stability
in
labor
relations.
by
contrast
in
the
evans’
case
title
vii
applies.
in
1964
and
1972
congress
reiterated
the
fact,
as
this
court
recognize
in
great
(inaudible)
that
the
purpose
of
title
vii
was
remedial,
(inaudible).
congress
recognized
that
it
would
be
upsetting
the
applecart.
institutional
stability
was
not
the
primer
concern.
secondly
the
statutory
language;
under
the
national…
mr.
alan
m.
levin
i
think
what
we
were
discussing
here
though
is
a
nlra
case
which
arose
at
a
time
in
1960
with
the
particular
interpretation
on
section
10(b)
of
the
act.
i
will
agree
that
there
are
appropriate
analogies
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
franks’
case,
but
the
analogy
does
not
apply
here.
the
second
distinction
that
i
would
make
is
on
the
statutory
language,
whereas
the
nlra
prohibits
complaints
issuing
based
upon
acts
occurring
prior
to
the
six-month
period.
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
does
not
use
those
terms.
title
vii
speaks
in
terms
of
challenging
a
practice
occurring
with
180
days,
the
challenged
practice,
but
more
importantly
the
legislative
history
is
really
to
key
difference.
as
mr.
justice
harlyn
stated
in
the
machinists
case
362
u.s.
426,
congress’
policy
was
to
let
sleeping,
collective,
bargaining
contracts
lie.
congress
specifically,
mr.
justice
harlyn
said,
specifically
adverted
to
the
problem
of
the
contracts
with
minority
unions,
had
previously
taken
pains
to
protect
minority
unions
against
belated
attack
and
had
enacted
10(b)
with
that
purpose
in
mind.
in
title
vii
by
contrast,
congress
has
accepted
the
continuing
violation
theory,
wrote
in
a
two-year
back
pay
limitation
rule,
has
implicitly
indicated
with
those
two
actions
that
there
are
cases
when
an
employer’s
past
actions
can
be
brought
in
to
assess
responsibility
to
assess
liability.
congress
was
explicitly
concerned
with
seniority
when
it
considered
amendments
for
the
1970,
for
the
title
vii
in
1972
and
congress
specifically
approved
the
paper
makers’
case.
we
believe
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
the
cases
that
congress
accepted
at
the
time
it
acted
prior
to
the
72
amendments
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
practices
which
in
present
operation
perpetuate
the
effects
of
the
past
the
discrimination.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
back
pay
claims
under
what
the
circumstances
your
honor?
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well,
congress
had
said
that
back
pay
claims
would
be
recognizable
beyond
the
six-month
period.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well,
we
are
not
seeking
back
pay
and
there
is
no
provision
in
706(g).
mr.
alan
m.
levin
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
no,
excuse
me
your
honor,
without
706(g)
as
our
contention
of
the
principle
which
still
be
valid,
but
the
706(g)
is
evidence
of
congress’
intention
when
it
was
considering
the
1972
amendments
in
title
vii.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
that
is
true.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
it
does
cut
both
ways
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
i
believe…
mr.
alan
m.
levin
no,
earlier
than
1972
mr.
justice
white.
we
do
seek
back
pay
for
the
seniority
differential
since
1972.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
point
that
was
being
discussed
just
before
the
luncheon
recess
that
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
reference
to
section
716
(g)
of
the
act
in
order
to
avoid
any
question
that
i
might
have
misstated
congress’
purpose.
it
is
true
that
the
legislative
history
demonstrates,
the
congress
that
the
two-year
limitation
was
essentially
intended
to
limit
back
pay
relief,
so
there
would
not
be
an
unlimited
period.
our
position
is
that
the
fact
that
there
still
is
a
two-year
limitation
period
as
opposed
to
a
six
month
filing
period
as
evidence
for
the
acceptance
of
the
theory
of
a
continuing
violation
and
the
impact
of
past
acts.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
are
we
talking
about
reinstatement
of
employment
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well,
our
position
would
be
that
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
the
employer’s
decision
not
to
rehire
the
person…
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well,
then
presumably
the
employer’s
reason
is
a
non-discriminatory
reason
and
we
would
hope
that
that
case
is
distinguishable
from
ours
on
that
basis.
i
would
also
like
to
return
to
a
point
which
was
made
by
mr.
bernstein
regarding
the
paper
makers’
case.
mr.
bernstein
indicated
that
under
paper
makers
there
was
a
present
discriminatory
seniority
policy.
i
believe
that
an
alternative
wording
or
an
alternative
interpretation
to
that
case
is
more
suitable
and
correct.
that
is
that
the
court
in
paper
makers
found
that
the
seniority
practices
and
issues
were
in
fact
facially
neutral
and
arrived
that
the
discriminatory
nature
thereof
only
by
reference
to
past
discrimination
which
was
incorporated
and
in
fact
in
that
case
plaintiffs
did
have
to
prove
the
existence
of
past
discrimination,
the
past
discrimination
that
was
in
hiring.
i
would
suggest
also
that
there
are
strong
policy
references
for
accepting
the
principle
advanced
by
ms.
evans
here.
if
this
court
reverses
the
evans
decision,
we
feel
that
it
maybe
well
nigh
impossible
in
the
future
to
attack
the
non-overt,
non-obvious,
subtle
but
pervasive
practices
in
employment
which
do
in
fact
extend
discrimination
into
the
present
be
it
in
a
departmental
seniority
system,
seniority
practices
and
employment
seniority
system,
a
promotional
system,
possibly
in
the
testing
area
as
well
because
the
only
really
effective
way
to
get
at
subtle
but
pervasive
discrimination
is
by
looking
at
the
roots
of
the
practice,
the
historical
background
of
the
practice,
how
did
it
originate,
what
affect
does
it
have.
if
we
cannot
look
at
that
then
i
submit
that
the
really
pervasive
form
of
discrimination
in
our
society
today
maybe
untouchable
because
the
days
of
the
overt
and
the
obvious
seems
to
be
passing.
seldom
if
ever
or
less
often
than
before
do
we
see
explicit
signs
of
discrimination.
no
jews
need
apply,
no
blacks
need
apply,
no
catholics
need
apply.
today
the
prevalent
form
of
discrimination
is
subtle
and
we
believe
that
the
way
to
get
at
it
is
with
the
principle
we
have
here
and
upholding
of
the
evans
decision,
far
from
opening
a
pandora’s
box
will
keep
open
a
necessary
avenue
of
relief
under
title
vii.
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well,
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
that
that
problem,
if
it
exists
is
in
fact
the
de
minimis
because
i
think
that
it
is…
mr.
alan
m.
levin
well,
what
i
am
suggesting
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
it
is
rare
for
an
employer
to
rehire
a
past
discriminatory.
i
am
also
suggesting
that
if
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
the
employer’s
action
is
in
fact
based
upon
past
discrimination,
but
he
does
not
rehire
because
the
person
is
a
past
discriminatory
that
that
would
be
closer
to
our
case
different
from
the
collins
case.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
thank
you.
