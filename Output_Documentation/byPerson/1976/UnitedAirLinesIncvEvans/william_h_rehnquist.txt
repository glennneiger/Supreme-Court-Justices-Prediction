justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levin,
well,
what
if
your
client
claimed
here
instead
of
being
under
the
employment
section
of
the
civil
rights
act
was
under
the
open
housing
section
and
she
is
asserted
that
she
had
been
discriminatory
denied
housing
in
1968
and
then
she
came
back
in
1978
and
asserted
she
had
been
discriminatory
denied
the
same
housing,
the
same
house
she
wanted
to
buy
in
1968,
she
again
tried
to
buy
in
1978
and
do
you
think
she
could
recessitate
any
part
of
her
1968
claim
by
making
a
claim
of
discrimination
in
respect
of
the
same
house
10
years
later?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
your
rule
were
adopted
by
the
court,
it
would
certainly
put
some
pressure
on
united
not
to
ever
rehire
anybody
who
might
have
had
a
claim
against
them
in
the
past
with,
would
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don’t
yet
to
a
doctrine
of
latches
or
you
have
congressionally
specified
statutes
of
limitations
though
that
is
congress
is
saying
that
the
claim
shall
not
be
filed
after
such
a
day.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
should
there
be
a
doctrine
of
latches
that
all,
if
congress,
if
it
not
time-barred
by
the
congressional
acts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
levin,
i
can’t
let
that
last
comment
go
without
observing
that
if
she
had
been
a
married
male
attendants,
she
wouldn’t
have
this
job
in
1968,
would
she
because
they
excluded
all
males
from
the
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
read
this
sprogis
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
merely
thought
you
see
it
that
without
it
you
would
not
have
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
i
suppose
it
is
706(g),
in
the
absence
of
that
you
might
be
able
to
get
back
pay
for
eight
or
ten
years
that
congress…
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
cut
off
a
right
that
would
otherwise…
