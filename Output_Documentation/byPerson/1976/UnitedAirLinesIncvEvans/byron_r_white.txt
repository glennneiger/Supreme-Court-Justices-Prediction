justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
concede
to
back
pay,
if
there
were
a
back
pay,
payment
would
be
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
reinstatement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
am
not
referring
to
anything,
i
am
just
asking
you
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
assume
that
she
has
not
been
hired
and
that
she
asked
for
reinstatement.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
any
different
than
a
back
pay
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
just
say
we
are
full
now;
we
haven’t
done
any
places
for
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
it’s
like
your
back
pay
claim
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
in
this
argument
if
i
understood
you
correctly,
you
conceded
that
you
will
not
have
a
back
pay
claim
on
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
about
the
reinstatement?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
talking
about
reinstatement
of
a
person
who
was
discriminatorily
discharged
and
asked
for
a
reinstatement
after
six
months.
