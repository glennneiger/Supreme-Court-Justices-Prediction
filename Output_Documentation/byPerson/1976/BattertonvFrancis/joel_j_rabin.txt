mr.
joel
j.
rabin
thank
you,
mister
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
litigation
began
only
six
years
ago
and
it
has
been
before
the
court
on
two
previous
occasions.
despite
its
complex
course
through
the
federal
judicial
system,
there
is
only
one
clear
cut
issue,
now
facing
the
court
this
time.
and,
that
is
whether
the
present
version
of
the
regulation
of
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare,
45
cfr,
233-100a1
is
valid
under
the
grant
of
rule
making
authority
containing
section
407a
of
the
social
security
act.
so,
what
we
are
arguing
today
is
an
administrative
law
case.
one
concerning
the
proper
scope
of
agency
rule
making.
by
its
petition
for
certiorari,
maryland
seeks
reversal
of
an
order
by
a
three-judge
district
court,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuits
denying
maryland’s
motion
to
vacate
an
injunction
previously
entered
by
the
district
court.
that
denial
was
based
on
holding
that
the
hw
regulation
was
invalid
under
section
407a.
before
stating
the
facts,
it
might
be
helpful
to
briefly
outline
the
statutory
framework.
the
afdc-uf
program,
unlike
the
regular
afdc
program,
authorizes
benefits
to
two
parent
households,
where
the
need
or
deprivation
of
the
children
in
the
family
arise
from
the
unemployment
of
the
father.
program
was
first
enacted
in
1961
as
the
unemployed
parent
program
and
covered
need
or
deprivation
arising
from
the
unemployment
of
either
parent.
in
its
original
form
section
407,
provided
for
coverage
of
children,
who
are
needy
as
a
result
of
the
unemployment
of
a
parent
“as
define
by
the
state.”
in
1968,
substantial
amendments
were
made
in
program
and
the
language
of
section
407
was
changed
from
unemployment
as
defined
by
the
state
to
“unemployment”
as
determined
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary.
after
passage
of
these
amendments,
hew
prescribed
the
predecessor
version
of
233-100a1,
which
mandated
an
hours
work
criterion
for
state
definitions
of
unemployment.
all
persons
who
work
less
than
30
hours
per
week.
the
regulation
also
permitted
coverage
per
persons
who
work
up
to
35
hours
per
week.
that
was
the
regulation
which
was
in
effect
when
this
litigation
began
in
1971.
the
claimants
in
this
case,
all
applied
for
maryland
afdc-uf
benefits,
after
applying
for
and
being
denied,
maryland
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
claimant
robert
francis,
a
laboratory
technician,
was
denied
unemployment
insurance
because
he
was
participating
in
a
strike
which
resulted
in
a
work
stoppage
at
his
plant.
claimant
edward
wright,
who
intervened
in
the
francis
case,
was
disqualified
because
he
was
fired
from
his
job
as
a
carpenter
for
excessive
absenteeism
in
the
maryland
unemployment
insurance
agency
determined
at
that
time,
the
constituted
gross
misconduct.
claimant
barry
bethea(ph),
who
files
a
separate
action,
which
was
consolidated
with
francis
case,
on
appeal
was
disqualified
from
unemployment
conversion,
when
it
was
determined
that
he
had
voluntarily
left
his
job
as
a
truck
driver
delivery
man
without
a
good
cause.
all
these
claimants
were
then
denied
afdc-uf
benefits
in
maryland
pursuing
to
maryland’s
social
service
regulation,
702091082,
which
provides
that
a
grant
may
not
be
paid
for
afdce
which
it
is
maryland
label
for
afdc-uf
“to
meet
need
due
to
being
disqualified
for
unemployment
insurance.”
the
three
judges
district
court
which
was
convened
in
the
francis
case
determined
in
its
first
decision
which
we
described
in
our
brief
as
francis
i,
that
this
maryland
regulation
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause,
as
claimants
had
alleged,
but
that
it
did
violate
the
predecessor
version
of
233-100a1.
in
a
courts’
view,
that
regulation
did
not
permits
states
to
consider
any
factors
other
than
hours
worked
in
determining
unemployment.
as
a
result,
the
district
courts
subsequently
enjoined
enforcement
of
the
maryland
regulation.
when
that
injunction
was
appealed
by
the
state
to
this
court,
the
solicitor
general
advised
the
court,
that
hew
had
always
interpreted
the
statue
and
its
own
regulation
to
permit
other
state
eligibility
factors
such
as
contained
in
the
maryland
rule.
however,
since
hew
had
decided
to
amend
its
regulation
to
expressly
permit
regulations
such
as
that
of
maryland,
the
solicitor
general
recommended
summary
affirmance,
and
this
court
took
that
action.
thereafter
hew
did
amend
the
regulation
as
the
solicitor
general
had
indicated
and
the
regulation
now
requires
that
states
pay
benefits
to
those
persons
who
work
less
than
100
hours
per
month
except
that
states
are
permitted
to
deny
benefits
to
persons
engaged
in
a
labor
dispute
or
engaged
in
conduct
resulting
or
which
would
result
in
disqualification
under
the
states
unemployment
compensation
laws.
after
that
regulation
was
amended
in
that
manner;
maryland
filed
a
motion
to
resolve
injunction
in
francis
i,
but
the
district
court
in
francis
ii
decision
held
that
the
maryland
regulation
was
still
invalid
on
the
ground
that
the
amended
hew
regulation
now
violated
section
407a.
the
decision
in
francis
ii
not
to
vacate
the
previously
entered
injunction
was
based
on
a
theory
that
section
407,
relates
to
unemployment
of
a
father.
and
a
father,
who
was
discharge
of
the
cause
is
unemployed,
and
hew
by
regulation
cannot
permit
states
to
deny
benefits
to
person
who
would
fall
within
this
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term.
with
regard
to
persons
out
of
work
as
a
result
of
a
labor
dispute,
the
district
court
held
the
amended
regulations
do
not
establish
any
standards
for
the
states.
it
did
not
prescribe
standards
as
the
statute
provided,
since
it
granted
discretion
to
the
states
to
deny
such
or
to
pay
such
benefits.
the
separate
district
court
decision
in
the
bethea
case,
adopted
the
same
reasoning
as
the
francis
ii
decision
did
with
regard
to
misconducts.
the
bethea
case
was
the
one
which
involved
persons
who
had
voluntarily
quitted
without
a
good
cause.
the
court
there
held
as
in
francis
ii,
with
regard
to
misconduct
that
such
persons
were
in
fact
unemployed
and
under
the
statute,
the
federal
agency
had
no
authority
to
deny
benefits
to
such
persons.
court
of
appeals
affirmed
those
two
district
court
decisions
in
a
per
curiam
decision
adopting
the
reasoning
and
conclusions
and
not
offering
any
rationale
of
its
own.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
state
believes
that
the
basic
issue
in
this
case,
is
of
the
scope
of
hew’s
ruling
authority.
we
contend
that
the
issue
is
not
whether
afdc-uf
benefit
should
be
paid
to
misconducts,
to
strikers,
or
the
persons
who
have
voluntarily
quit
there
jobs.
rather
the
question
is,
whether
the
statute
gives
hew
the
authority
to
allow
states
to
choose
to
pay
such
benefits.
our
position
stated
very
briefly,
is
that
statute
constitutes
a
very
broad
grant
of
legislative
type
of
rule
making
authority,
hew
and
that
the
regulation
constitutes
a
reasonable
exercise
of
that
authority.
there
obviously,
can
be
no
question
that
the
language
of
the
statute
expressly
grants
about
rule
making
authority.
we
believe
that
those
statutory
words
fall
within
the
label
that
the
professor
jaffe
and
davis
had
devised
namely,
legislative
type
of
rule
making.
other
commentators
refer
to
them
as
prescriptive
or
substantive
rules.
and
it
is
well
established,
that
such
rule
making
is
to
be
given
substantial
difference
by
the
courts.
as
this
court
stated
in
citizens
to
preserve
overton
park,
the
ultimate
standard
of
review
is
a
narrow
one.
the
court
is
not
empowered
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
agency.
thus,
the
hw
regulation,
we
contend
is
valid
and
should
be
upheld
if
it
is
reasonable
under
the
statute
even
if
the
court
favors
a
different
result.
claimants
and
the
district
court
avoided
the
issue
of
the
broad
scope
of
rule
making
authority
containing
section
407
in
two
ways.
first,
as
i
indicated,
they
argued
that
the
regulation
was
invalid
because
it
excluded
from
the
persons’
from
programs,
certain
persons’
who
fell
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
that
term.
we
would
respectfully
contend
that
that
reasoning
begs
the
question.
the
purpose
of
the
statutory
words
was
to
give
the
rule
making
authority
to
hew
and
for
hew
to
give
content
to
the
term
unemployment.
the
term
has
never
been
self
defining
in
the
statute.
it
was
not
self
defining
in
1961
and
it
is
not
self
defining
after
1968.
reliance
on
a
dictionary
meaning
cannot
answer
such
a
question
as
this
court
had
so
recognized
in
the
burns
v.
alcala
case
which
concerned
the
meaning
of
the
term
'dependent
child'.
while
the
district
court
and
the
claimants
choose
to
rely
on
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
term
'unemployment',
of
course,
they
choose
to
ignore
totally,
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
words
in
accordance
to
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary.
the
district
court
also
avoided
the
question
of
the
scope
of
rule
making
authority
contained
in
407
by
holding
with
regard
to
persons’
who
had
participated
in
a
labor
dispute,
that
the
section
mandated
a
uniform
national
definition
of
unemployment.
therefore,
the
district
court
reasoned
that
the
limited
grant
of
discretion
to
the
states
with
regard
to
such
persons’
disqualified
for
participation
in
labor
dispute
was
improper.
i
do
want
to
mention
at
this
point
that
maryland
agrees
with
the
point
raised
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
memorandum,
that
the
court
does
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
regulation
in
connection
with
persons’
participating
in
a
labor
dispute
because
in
maryland,
all
the
claimants
and
the
maryland
rule
only
operates
against
persons’
who
are
disqualified
for
unemployment
insurance.
it
so
happened
that
the
leading
name,
plaintiff
was
a
person
who
was
participating
in
a
strike
but
he
was
denied
benefits
because
under
the
maryland
rule,
he
was
disqualified
from
unemployment
insurance.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
we
think
it
is
not
the
test
for
term.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
hew
regulation
and
the
maryland
rule,
they
are
under
–
are
reasonable
under
that...
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
no,
we
think.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
and
we
would
not
contend
that
hew
could
not
look
at
the
dictionary
meaning
when
it
--
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
correct.
the
legislative
history
with
regard
to
section
407,
it
has
been
said
out
at
great
length
in
our
brief,
claimants
brief,
the
appendix
and
the
decisions
below
and
i
will
not
try
to
repeat
it.
it
is
true
that
there
are
phrases
in
the
committee
reports
that
talked
about
a
national
definition
of
unemployment.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
also
true
that
other
reports
talks
about
the
statute
as
authorizing
a
national
definition
or
in
sometimes
it
is
the
same
report
that
uses
the
phrase,
a
national
definition.
and
it
is
also
true
that
those
reports
at
some
points
used
the
actual
statutory
words
namely,
as
determined
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
hew.
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
the
congress
to
mandate
a
national
definition
with
regard
to
a
uniform
national
definition.
all
they
would
have
to
in
1968,
would
have
been
to
substitute
the
word
'secretary'
for
the
word
'state'
in
the
statute.
this
fact
was
recognized
by
the
district
court
in
its
francis
i
decision
but
and
that
decision
points
out
congress
chose
instead
to
use
new
words
which
did
not
mandatorily
require
the
secretary
to
require
each
state
to
adopt
the
same
of
the
word,
unemployment
but
instead
merely
authorize
the
secretary
to
prescribe
a
national
meaning
if
the
secretary
so
desires.
the
many
statements
as
to
the
intent
of
the
1968
change
must
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
actual
words
used
in
the
statute.
this
court
has
recognized,
the
most
persuasive
evidence
for
the
purpose
of
a
statute
is
the
words
by
which
the
legislature
chooses
to
give
expression
to
its
wishes.
we
think
that
when
one
considers
the
legislative
history
behind
the
1968
amendments
and
looks
at
the
words
of
the
statute
themselves,
it
is
clear
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
secretary
of
hew
was
free
to
allow
the
states
limited
discretion
to
vary
the
coverage
in
response
to
their
different
needs
and
policies.
thus,
under
the
broad
authority
granted
by
the
section,
the
federally
prescribed
standards
could
take
the
form
of
a
national
definition
but
they
could
also
grant
the
states
some
discretion
in
some
specific
areas
as
in
fact
the
regulation
has
done.
assuming
that
to
be
the
case,
hew's
regulations
still
must
meet
the
test
of
reasonableness
under
the
statute
or
the
courts
must
set
it
aside.
we
think,
it
is
clear
that
233-100a1
does
meet
that
test
in
connection
with
the
purposes
of
the
afdc-uf
program
as
set
out
a
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
when
the
program
was
first
adopted,
president
kennedy
indicated
that
it
was
intended
for
unemployed
workers
and
he
gave
the
example
of
a
person
who
had
exhausted
his
unemployment
compensation.
we
have
quoted
at
length
in
our
brief
from
the
statements
by
congressman
burns,
one
of
the
co-sponsors
of
the
original
legislation,
which
makes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
program
provide
benefits
to
persons
who
are
voluntarily
unemployed.
and
as
originally
adopted
in
1961
and
as
amended
in
1968,
congress
made
clear
that
the
program
was
intended
to
provide
assistance
to
persons
and
in
connection
with
employment
not
covered
by
the
existing
unemployment
compensation
program,
that
the
program
was
not
designed
to
substitute
for
that
already
existing
nationwide
program.
furthermore,
as
amended
the
program
is
very
similar
in
operation
on
unemployment
compensation
and
that
it
is
an
income
maintenance
program,
designed
to
assist
those
who
are
unemployed
not
as
result
of
their
own
conduct.
in
light
of
the
similarity
of
these
purposes,
namely
the
persons
who
are
involuntarily
unemployed,
we
think
it
is
clearly
not
unreasonable
to
attempt
by
regulation
or
to
permit
by
regulation,
a
state
to
harmonize
the
operation
of
these
two
income
maintenance
programs.
namely,
not
to
pay
benefits
under
one
scheme
for
conduct
which
results
in
a
disqualification
under
the
other.
we
note
that
the
district
court
in
dismissing
the
claimants
constitutional
claim,
recognized
this
harmonization
purpose
as
a
rational
basis
for
the
regulation.
the
court
upheld
the
argument
that
the
rationalization
of
these
two
programs
which
are
both
part
of
the
scheme
of
cooperative
federalism
described
by
this
court
in
the
king
case
established
by
the
social
security
act
was
a
proper
rational
basis
although
the
district
court
did
not
necessarily
agree
with
that
basis.
it
is
certainly
not
unreasonable
to
grant
states
limited
discretion
contained
in
233-100a1.
in
one
of
the
public
assistance
programs
created
by
the
social
security
act;
when
the
statute
permits
such
a
grant
of
limited
discretion.
now,
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
extend
assistance
to
a
group
of
needy
persons
and
this
is
true
of
all
the
public
assistance
programs.
by
making
partial
federal
reimbursement
available
to
those
states
which
need
certain
substitute
federal
requirements.
now,
unlike
the
other
public
assistance
programs,
24
states
have
not
joined
the
afdc-uf
program.
although,
as
indicated
in
our
brief,
three
states
have
joined
in
the
last
two
years
and
one
state
has
dropped
out
of
the
program.
as
shown
by
the
solicitor
general’s
memorandum,
a
significant
number
of
states,
nine,
if
you
count
and
include
maryland,
have
restrictions
--
actually
there
is
more
than
nine
because
the
solicitor
general
classified
eight
states
with
regard
to
cause
and
eight
states
with
regards
to
strikers,
so
the
total
number
of
states
who
might
be
interested
in
this
type
of
a
restriction
would
be
greater
than
nine.
it
is
difficult
for
maryland
to
see
how
the
prohibition
against
such
state
discretion
will
encourage
the
general
purpose
of
the
program,
of
the
statute
through
state
participation
in
this
program
which
is
designed
to
assist
needy,
laid-off
workers
and
unemployed
through
no
fault
of
their
own.
we
think
that
perhaps
the
best
proof,
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
grant
of
discretion
found
on
the
regulation
is
the
approach
taken
by
the
federal
government
itself
in
connection.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
you
are
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
that
it
does
not
use
that
phrase.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
the
statute,
but
it
does
not,
in
other
ways
may
clear
that
persons
who
through
their
own
conduct
are
not
active,
for
example,
not
actively
seeking
employment
are
not
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
well,
that
is
correct,
if
you
are
talking
about
the
medical
assistance,
in
addressing
this
--
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
right.
we
think,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
the
program
was
not
designed
to
assist
those
who
are
voluntarily
unemployed.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
correct.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
right.
and
we
do
not
content,
it
is
not
maryland's
position
that
the
states
that
have
chosen
not
to
adopt
the
restrictions
that
maryland
has
chosen
are
doing
something
illegal.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
but.mr.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
correct,
and
we
think
that,
when
you
look
at
total
statutory
framework,
there
is
a
requirement
for
job
registration.
there
is
a
denial
of
benefits
for
refusal
to
accept
a
suitable
job
offer.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
these
are
all
statutory
and
they
are
contained
in
section
407.
we
think
taking
those
requirements
with
the
legislative
history,
it
seems
clear
that
the
thrust
of
the
program
was
to
help
those
who
are
involuntarily
unemployed.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
24
states
had
not
participated
although,
a
few
have,
because
of
the
recent
economic
conditions
in
last
few
years,
three
have
joined
the
program.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
receive
no
assistance
of
this
type
at
all
and
it
is
our
contention
that
is
reasonable
for
the
secretary
of
hew
to
look
at
what
he
can
do
to
encourage
those
states
to
participate
in
the
program
in
prescribing
his
regulations
and
that
is
we
think,
in
fact,
supports
this
particular
regulation,
which
gives
states
the
choice.
it
is
does
not
mandate
to
make
the
payments
and
it
does
not
prohibit
that
they
make
the
payments.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
we
think
so.
we
think
that
this
court
made
clear
under
dublino
decision,
that
in
connection
with
the
welfare
cases,
the
welfare
programs,
the
courts
are
to
get
considerable
attitude
to
the
differing
state
interests,
so
that
the
programs
can
be
developed
in
a
flexible
manner
to
meet
the
needs
in
particular
states.
the
congress
is
clearly
aware
of
the
issue
of
coverage
of
strikers
in
this
particular
program.
that
is
shown
by
colloquia
between
congressman
mills
and
dominic,
which
is
cited
in
claimants
brief,
so
congress
knew,
when
this
program
was
originally
adopted
in
1961,
that
it
was
not
mandating
or
not
prohibiting,
in
fact
the
colloquia
goes
to
the
effect,
the
congressman
mills
indicates
that
if
states
chose,
they
could
make
the
payments
to
strikers.
we
think
that,
as
i
was
saying,
the
example
by
the
federal
government
in
connection
with
the
state
administered
unemployment
compensation
program,
we
think
is
a
good
example
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary’s
regulation.
congress
has
been
aware
for
years
and
the
federal
agencies
have
been
aware
for
years,
to
the
fact
that
a
few
states,
pay
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
strikers
and
many
states
do
not
pay
unemployment
compensation
to
strikers.
however,
with
regard
to
that
particular
program,
which
is
administered
by
the
states
and
it
is
financed
through
state
taxes,
congress
has
decided
to
leave
that
discretion
to
the
states.
we
think
that
that
approach
is
no
less
reasonable
when
taken
by
the
administrator
of
a
program
who
is
charged
with
broad
authority
to
implement
and
supervise
the
program.
no
less
reasonable
than
it
is,
when
it
is
taken
by
the
congress.
claimants
contend
that
the
hew
regulation
is
invalid
under
the
state
eligibility
decisions
by
this
court
in
recent
years
in
the
welfare
field,
including
the
most
recent
formulation
in
burns
v.
alcala;
the
1975
decision,
i
referred
to
previously
concerning
whether
unborn
children
are
necessarily
covered
under
the
afdc
program.
however,
contrary
to
their
contention,
it's
our
view
that
that
decision
really
supports
the
validity
of
the
hew
regulation.
in
burns,
the
court
stated
that
a
participating
state
may
not
deny
aid
to
persons
who
come
within
the
statute.
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
intent
that
the
congress
meant
the
coverage
to
be
optional.
well,
there
is
such
an
indication
in
this
case.
it
is
right
in
the
statute.
congress
provided
that
the
secretary
of
health
education
and
welfare
had
the
option
to
extend
or
restrict
the
coverage
of
the
statute
and
also
to
grant
a
limited
discretion
to
the
states.
we
think
that
even
more
appropriate
in
support
of
the
hew
regulation
is
the
reasoning
of
the
dublino
decision
to
which
i
referred
to
previously.
we
also
think
that
the
louis
v.
martin
case
which
upheld
hew
broad
rule
making
authority
with
regard
to
the
afdc
program
supports
this
case.
we
think
that
the
decision
by
this
court
recently
enabled
behind
which
upheld
the
regulation
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
also
supports
the
regulation.
that
decision
cautioned
the
courts
to
defer
to
the
informed
experience
and
the
judgment
of
responsible
administrative
agencies,
even
if
they
might
favor
a
different
result.
the
decision
below
interpret
the
statutory
language,
unemployment
as
determined
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary,
which
is
an
expressed
grant
of
very
broad
rule
making
authority,
to
mandate
coverage
for
persons’
disqualified
from
unemployment
compensation
because
they
were
fired
for
misconduct
or
because
they
voluntarily
quit
their
jobs.
and
also,
to
bar
any
grant
of
discretion
to
the
states
as
to
payment
to
the
strikers.
in
effect,
they
say
that
hew
has
no
broad
authority
with
regard
to
that
first
category.
and
with
regard
to
the
second
category,
hew
must
either
mandate
payments
on
a
nationwide
basis
or
prohibit
payments
on
a
national
basis.
we
respectfully
contend
that
that
is
not
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
or
of
the
legislature
history.
it
is
now
and
the
solicitor
general
have
demonstrated
the
regulations
which
hew
has
promulgated
under
the
statutory
words,
we
think
is
a
reasonable
regulation
in
the
maryland
regulation
which
authorizes
it
are
valid
and
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
thank
you.
mr.
joel
j.
rabin
just
a
few
remarks,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
although
solicitor
general
is
correct
that
the
maryland
rule
operate
on
the
basis
of
disqualification
of
unemployment
insurance,
it
is
also
true
that
the
reasoning
that
applies
to
that
part
of
the
regulation
would
probably
have
an
impact
as
to
the
validity
of
the
second
part
of
the
hew
regulation
and
the
disqualification,
namely
participation
in
labor
dispute,
and
in
fact,
if
the
court
upheld
the
hew
regulation,
that,
i
think
would
dispose
of
the
issue
entirely.
there
was
a
pending
regulation
by
hew,
which
in
light
of
the
lower
court’s
decision
proposed
mandating
payments
to
persons’
who
are
disqualified
for
unemployment
compensation,
except
those
persons’
who
were
participating
in
a
labor
dispute
but
the
secretary
chose
to
hold
up
action
on
that
regulation
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
i
do
want
to
indicate
my
agreement
with
major
trust
of
justice
rehnquist’s
question
and
point
out
that
in
the
legislative
history,
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
was
thinking
about
the
unemployment
compensation
scheme
because
in
fact,
president
kennedy
in
his
statement
proposing
the
program,
used
as
an
example,
a
person
who
had
exhausted
his
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
it
is
true
that
there
are
certain
differences
between
these
two
types
of
programs
but
it
is
also
true
that
programs
are
very
interrelated
and
there
is
substantial
overlap.
for
example,
there
is
a
substantial
work
experience
requirement
in
the
afdc-uf
program,
which
in
most
cases,
under
many
state
laws
would
make
the
person
eligible
for
unemployment
insurance.
it
is
also
true
that
in
many
states
including
maryland,
the
benefits
to
receive
unemployment
compensation
are
affected
by
the
number
of
children
in
your
family.
there
is
what
is
called
a
dependency
allowance,
so
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
say
that
the
programs
are
unrelated
or
that
they
are
totally
different.
there
are
both
income
maintenance
programs
designed
to
assist
persons’
who
had
a
substantial
connection
with
the
work
force
and
who
are
now
unemployed
and
it
is
our
contention
that
their
major
thrust
is
to
assist
those
person’s
who
are
unemployed
as
a
result
to
no
fault
of
their
own,
involuntarily
unemployed
as
the
java
(ph)
decision
itself
pointed
out.
therefore,
we
contend,
it
is
reasonable
to
permit
the
states
to
do
in
this
similar
program,
what
the
states
have
already
done
in
the
other
program,
namely,
had
decided
not
to
encourage
or
not
to
at
least
pay
benefits
to
certain
persons
for
conduct
which
they
considered
operates
contrary
to
the
basic
thrust
of
the
program.
i
also
want
to
mention,
and
i
think
that
the
word
of
art
is
a
good
phrase
that
is
used
by
my
colleague,
which
is
exactly
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
passed
the
statute.
that
was
why
they
gave
legislative
type
of
rule
making
authority
to
the
secretary.
in
fact,
the
rule
making
authority
given
to
the
secretary
in
section
407,
it
is
my
understanding,
is
much
broader
than
the
authority
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
define
employees.
but
the
opinions
of
this
court
made
clear
that
the
he
does
have
broad
authority
to
define
the
word
'employee'
in
that
scheme
and
we
think
that
with
a
much
more
direct
grant
of
authority
in
this
case,
the
agency
would
have
even
greater
authority
and
even
greater
difference
should
be
paid
to
his
judgment
unless,
it
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
regulation.
i
have
no
further
remarks
unless
there
are
any
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
