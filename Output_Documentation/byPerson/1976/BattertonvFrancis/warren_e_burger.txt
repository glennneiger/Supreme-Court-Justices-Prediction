chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1181
batterton
against
francis.
mr.
rabin,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
have
told
us
that
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
unemployment
is
basically,
irrelevant,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
dispositive.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
would
concede,
i
suppose
that
it
is
relevant,
if
it
is
said
that
in
looking
at
the
regulations,
you
have
to,
they
have
some
rational
relationship
to
the
word
unemployment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
defining
the
word
unemployment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
do
not
say
that
the
statutory
phrase
is
irrelevant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
all
depends
on
what
the
regulation
says.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
must
not
look
at
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
and
then
defining
by
regulation,
what
it
means
as
in
giving
a
precise
regulatory
definition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
other
forms
of
welfare
benefits
to
take
care
of
the
needy
children,
needy
people
besides
just
the
ones
we
are
talking
about
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
this
is
afdc-uf?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
designed
to
assist
children.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
understand
that
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
is
whether
this
regulation
is
permissible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
statutory
or?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
states
are
not
compelled
to
participate
in
this
program.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
then
no
states
the
families
and
the
children
of
those
families
in
these
circumstances
depend
upon
other.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
flexibility
to
permit
variations
from
state
to
state
were
contemplated
by
congress
to
take
into
account
different
forms
of
industry
and
occupation
among
other
things,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
brown
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
your
quarrel
with
the
mechanism
or
with
the
substance
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
state
of
maryland
had
enacted
its
eligibility
qualifications
in
precisely
the
same
terms
but
in
a
separate
statute
or
regulation.
i
am
trying
to
get
at
just
--
the
focus
of
your
objection
to
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
two
are
quite
similar.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
statute
in
question
was
enacted
to
give
the
secretary
authority
to
make
rules
relating
to
supplementing
state
unemployment
compensation
plans,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you
do
not
think
that
any
of
this
statutory
language
or
can
be
related
to
disqualifications
in
state
plans
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
legislation
had
in
mind
the
state
plan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
state
unemployment
compensation
plan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mention
those.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
as
you
are
aware
and
as
i
am
sure
your
opponents
are
aware,
that
typical
state
unemployment
compensation
plan
provides
four
or
five
disqualifications
and
that
serve
in
the
kind
of
labor
dispute
type
that
you
have
been
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
at
least
inferable
that
congress,
when
they
used
the
term
'unemployment'
was
using
it
in
the
term,
in
the
sense
that
unemployment
is
that
term
be
used
to
be
define
eligibility
for
state
unemployment
compensation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
is
possible
explanations.
it
is
not
that
enough
for
the
secretary
to
go
forward
on
and
promulgate
a
regulation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
did
they
authorize
the
secretary,
then
to
make
regulations
defining
the
term?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
that
in
an
absolute
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
congress
wanted
to
have
it;
absolutely
uniform
that
would
have
done
all
the
defining
itself
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
very
carefully
refrained
from
doing
that
and
explained
that
they
wanted
to
leave
the
states,
some
flexibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
not
we
hold
in
the
java
(ph)
case
that
it
is
a
partial
substitute
for
the
earnings
that
have
determined
in
--.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
are
limitations
even
on
the
unemployment
insurance,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
must
accept,
you
must
report
regularly.
you
must
accept
employment
if
it
meets
the
standards.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
rabin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-1181,
batterton
against
francis
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
