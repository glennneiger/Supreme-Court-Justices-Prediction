mr.
christopher
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
basically
involves
a
question,
whether
or
not,
the
secretary
of
hew
has
followed
the
power
that
he
was
given
by
congress
in
a
specific
statute
42
usc
section
607.
the
statute
reads
and
as
it
is
pertinent
to
this
case,
in
defining
who
can
get
this
certain
kind
of
welfare
benefit
for
families
who
do
have
children.
that
it
must
go
to
needy
children
whose
“father's
unemployment
as
determined
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary
and
so
forth
and
so
on
with
other
pre-conditions.”
so,
we
are
talking
about
unemployment
in
accordance
with
standards
prescribed
by
the
secretary.
the
secretary
in
attempting
to
define
unemployment
has
done
so
in
various
ways.
first
of
all,
the
secretary
has
defined
unemployment
in
terms
of
hours
worked,
which
we
have
no
quarrel
with
whatsoever.
that
is
the
most
common
sensible
way
in
which
to
define
whether
or
not
a
person
is
unemployed
or
not.
there
may
be
other
ways
and
maybe,
whether
or
not,
he
has
a
contractual
duty
or
right
with
respect
to
an
employer.
it
could
also
perhaps
be
defined
with
respect
to
the
rights
that
he
has,
seniority
rights
perhaps
to
an
old
job,
very
many
aspects
of
what
an
employee
might
have
to
expect
in
a
specific
case.
but
the
secretary
of
hew
has
not
defined
the
term
unemployment
in
that
way,
instead
the
secretary
has
basically
defined
the
term,
by
the
legal
consequences
of
the
way
in
which
a
person
lost
his
last
job.
so
in
addition,
to
defining
unemployment
in
terms
of
hours
worked,
the
secretary
also
allows
the
states
at
their
option
if
they
so
choose
the
definition
of
unemployment
which
turns
on
two
things:
one,
whether
or
not
that
person
is
eligible
for
unemployment
insurance
and
secondly,
whether
or
not
that
person
has
been
involved
in
a
labor
dispute.
it
is
our
contention,
your
honors,
that
the
latter
definitions
or
attempted
definitions
by
hew
are
null
and
void
as
all
the
judges
that
have
heard
this
case
thus
far,
have
found.
as
a
prelude,
i
would
like
to
say
that,
we
agree
with
the
state.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
that
part
of
the
hew
regulation
dealing
with
giving
the
states
the
power
to
disqualify
people
from
afdc-uf,
this
welfare
program
who
have
in
turn
been
disqualified
by
those
states
for
unemployment
insurance.
i
do
not
think,
the
solicitor
general
does
not
think
and
the
state
that
has
considered
it
does
not
think,
that
we
are
talking
about
that
part
of
the
hew’s
statute
dealing
with
striker
disqualification.
the
state
has
not
acted
on
that
basis.
it
merely
disqualifies
people
who
are
disqualified
in
turn
for
unemployment
insurance.
as
a
consequence,
i
cannot
see
how
this
case
or
controversy
before
this
court
on
that
second
part
of
the
hew’s
statute
dealing
with
striker
disqualification.
mr.
christopher
brown
i
am
not--.
mr.
christopher
brown
objection
to
the
definition
itself
or
my
objection
to
what
is
that
issue
on
this
case?
i
was
saying
that
the
mr.
christopher
brown
well,
i
do
not
think
that
issue
in
this
case
is
part
of
the
hew
regulation
dealing
with
strikers,
per
se.
labor
disputes
per
se.
i
think,
and
maryland
conceded
and
solicitor
general
states
that
--
what
is
that
issue
here
is
that
portion
of
the
regulation,
the
hew
regulation,
which
deals
with
disqualification
from
unemployment
benefits.
now,
it
so
happens
that
maryland
unlike
other
states,
few
other
states
in
(inaudible)
tends
to
also
disqualify
strikers
from
unemployment
insurance.
so,
in
that
sense
it
is
relevant
but
it
is
very
indirectly
irrelevant.
now,
the
case
seemingly
can
be
resolved
without
specifically
asking
the
question
of
whether
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
define
unemployment
in
terms
of
people
who
are
involved
in
labor
disputes,
who
are
not
involved
in
labor
disputes.
it
seems
to
be
two
separate
different
kinds
of
questions.
i
cannot
see
another
party
seem
to
come
up
with
a
way
to
see,
how
there
can
be
a
case
of
controversy
with
respect
to
the
labor
dispute
portion.
we
all
admit
to
there
is
with
respect
to
the
unemployment
insurance
disqualification,
of
course,
i
have
said
that
along.
our
major
controversy,
your
honors,
with
the
secretary’s
definition
allowing
states
to
disqualify
people,
if
they
in
turn
have
been
disqualified
from
employment
insurance
is
this.
the
statute
gives
the
secretary,
the
power
to
define
unemployment
not
the
way
in
which
you
lost
your
last
job.
a
person
can
be
unemployed
now,
for
various
different
reasons
that
brought
him
in
to
that
position.
unemployment
in
the
common
sensible
term
means,
your
status
right
now.
do
you
have
a
job?
do
not
you
have
a
job?
are
you
getting
money?
are
you
not
getting
money?
mr.
christopher
brown
your
honor,
i
remember
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
has
that
concept.
mr.
christopher
brown
state
welfare
plan
or
unemployment
insurance.
mr.
christopher
brown
the
act
did
have
in
mind,
the
state
unemployment
compensation
plans
to
very
large
extent.
mr.
christopher
brown
five
or
six
times
in
this
specific
section
of
the
act.
mr.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
christopher
brown
well,
that
is
possible
explanation.
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
legislative
history
that
i
have
found.
mr.
christopher
brown
i
do
to
think
so,
your
honor,
because
it
is
such
unusual
explanation.
unemployment
is
the
first
thing
that
pops
to
my
mind
in
trying
to
define
an
unemployed
person,
is
not
to
define
the
legal
consequences
that
he
may
be
suffering
from
another
benefit
program.
that
does
not
necessarily
--
let
us
take
this
case,
for
example,
a
person
who
is
allegedly
committed
misconduct
in
the
job
and
therefore
is
now
out
of
work.
the
secretary
in
essence
is
trying
to
make
that
person
who
has
no
employer,
who
has
no
money,
and
who
is
out
of
work,
somehow
not
be
unemployed.
seems
to
me,
the
secretary
is
standing
the
definition
on
his
head.
now,
you
can
do
that
in
certain
situations,
certain
acts,
for
instance,
the
nlra
which
has
been
talked
about
here.
it
defines
employee
in
ways
in
which
the
common
person
would
not
really
define
employee.
and
there
are
many
statutes
which
do
that
but
there
is
no
indications
whatsoever
in
this
case
that
the
congress
intended
the
secretary
to
come
up
with
a
term
of
art
kind
of
definition,
as
opposed
to
the
common
sensible
definition
of
what
an
unemployed
person
is.
and
indeed,
if
there
is
any
hint
to
be
had
from
how
the
congress
interrelated
this
program
into
the
unemployment
insurance
schemes
that
went
on
in
the
private
state,
in
each
state,
it
would
be
i
think,
that
it
did
not
intend
to
disqualify
this
sub
class
of
people.
otherwise,
they
would
have
said
so.
mr.
christopher
brown
it
is
my
guess,
your
honor
that
the
primary
motivation
was
the
legislative
history
shows,
for
example,
arizona
at
one
point
in
time
had
16
families
in
this
program,
neighboring
utah
or
colorado,
i
forgot
which,
had
1,200
or
1,600
something
like
that.
each
state
has
its
own
different
terms.
congress
wanted
to
unify
things.
legislative
history
is
replete
with
comment
about
a
national
uniform
standard
across
the
country.
mr.
christopher
brown
i
am
sure,
not
in
an
absolute
sense
but
in
a
much
better
sense
than
what
existed
at
that
point
of
time.
mr.
christopher
brown
that
would
have
one
way
of
accomplish
the
task.
my
guess
is
this.
mr.
christopher
brown
well,
not
that
they
wanted
to
leave
the
states
flexibility
but
they
wanted
to
leave
the
definition
of
unemployment
to
the
secretary,
who
would
be
in
better
position
to
define,
normally
we
would
think,
what
unemployment
actually
means
and
my
guess
is
that
they
would
want
the
secretary
to
define
in
terms
of
hours,
as
the
secretary
originally
did.
the
secretary
has
come
up
with
his
new
way
of
defining
unemployment
as
a
result
of
this
lawsuit.
this
is
the
way
to
go
around
this,
the
earlier
victory,
plaintiffs
had
in
this
lawsuit.
but
my
guess
would
be,
congress
said
“secretary,
you
pick
the
hour
number”
and
the
secretaries
had
two
different
–
originally
it
was
30
hours
a
week,
now
it
is
100
hours
a
month
which
is
the
cut
off
limit.
if
you
work
more
than
no
afdc,
you
are
not
unemployed.
congress
most
rationally
could
have
thought,
let
the
secretary
pick
the
hour
amount
or
perhaps
let
the
secretary
define
in
another
ways
in
terms
of
existing
contract
with
an
employer,
amount
of
money
to
person
earns
as
opposed
to
amount
of
hours
of
person
works.
there
are
many
other
ways
to
do
it.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
whatsoever,
that
congress
contemplates
the
secretary
doing
this.
if
anything,
a
congressman
mills
at
one
point
in
the
legislative
history
has
said
in
response
to
a
question
asked
on
the
floor
and
mills,
of
course
is
the
sort
of
the
father
of
this
legislation.
he
said
that
labor
--
that
strikers
could
be
given
afdc-uf
benefits.
if
the
states
so
desired,
this
was
back
in
the
days
when
the
states
had
full
definitional
ability
and
federal
government,
hew
did
not.
now,
i
think
in
all,
but
two
states,
strikers
are
ineligible
for
unemployment
insurance.
it
would
be
very
strange
if
congressman
mills
felt
that
unemployment
insurance
disqualificants
could
not
get
these
program
benefits,
that
he
would
say
something
like
that
about
strikers.
it
is
totally
inconsistent.
another
thing
which
was
very
inconsistent
with
here,
is
that
the
act
mentions
unemployment
insurance
five
or
six
different
times.
there
is
one
section
of
the
act
talks
about
how
it
interrelates
with
the
afdc
program
and
for
example,
if
you
are
receiving
unemployment
insurance,
you
could
not
get
this
program.
congress
has
recently
amended
that
act
to
slightly
change
glodgett
v.
philbrook
case,
a
couple
of
years
ago,
but
still
they
talk
about
unemployment
insurance,
time
and
time
again
in
the
statute,
but
they
do
not
say
what
the
state
is
trying
to
get
this
court
to
say,
namely,
that
congress
intended
to
those
who
cannot
get
unemployment
insurance,
a
fortiori
then
could
not
get
this
welfare
program.
mr.
christopher
brown
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
christopher
brown
whether
the
secretary
is
permitted
to
give
to
the
state
mr.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct;
i
see
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
points
in
that
direction.
another
thing
which
points
against
that
direction
is
this
very
significant
concern,
if
you
acquainted
yourself
with
legislative
history,
you
would
see
its
various
parts
--legislative
history
almost
says
nothing
in
this
case
but
one
thing
that
it
does
say
is
that
we
want
uniform
national
definitions
set
by
the
secretary.
we
want
the
secretary
to
say
what
you
can
do
states
and
what
you
cannot
do.
what
the
secretary
has
done
in
this
case
in
essence
to
say
that
if
you
want
to,
you
do
not
have
to
but
if
you
want
to,
you
can
disqualify
people
who
cannot
get
unemployment
insurance.
now,
each
state
has
its
own
different
system
of
unemployment
insurance.
this
book,
a
publication
by
the
us
department
of
labor
talks
about
all
the
differences
in
all
of
the
state
programs
on
unemployment
insurance.
if
the
state
is
correct
and
the
secretary
probably
can
allow
states
to
exclude
people
who
cannot
get
unemployment
insurance
compensation.
you
are
going
to
have
a
different
afdc-uf
program
in
every
single
state,
almost
by
definition.
we
think
that
would
be
the
case
because
each
state
has
different
unemployment
insurance
system.
and
then
also,
the
states
do
not
necessarily
have
to
disqualify
people
who
cannot
get
unemployment
insurance.
the
secretary
gives
them
the
option
of
doing
that
or
not
doing
that.
it
is
sort
of
confusing,
the
secretary
is
allowing
us
to
define
these
people
as
unemployed,
if
we
want
to
or
as
not
unemployed,
if
a
state,
for
instance,
does
not
want
to.
it
cannot
have
it
both
ways.
its
got
to
be
one
way,
its
got
to
be
the
other
way.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
problems.
if
the
secretary
would
not
be
in
as
much
danger
in
terms
of
invalidity
of
the
regulation,
if
he
had
said
it
has
to
be
this
,states
you
do
this,
you
do
this,
you
do
this,
and
you
do
this
and
that
is
what
you
have
to
do.
secretary
of
for
various
reasons,
i
think
tried
to
play
both
ways
and
a
person
in
this
category,
these
people
in
this
class,
they
are
unemployed
or
they
are
unemployed,
but
they
cannot
be
both
ways.
another
aspect
of
which,
i
think,
makes
it
very,
i
think
it
is
reasonable
to
assume,
that
the
kind
of
people
who
get
afdc-uf,
this
class
of
people
here,
are
in
many
ways
very
different
from
the
class
of
people
who
get
unemployment
insurance.
and
as
a
consequence,
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
congress
to
allow
the
children
of
these
parents
to
get
this
kind
of
benefit,
whereas
they
will
allow
the
states
to
disqualify
their
parents
from
getting
unemployment
insurance.
now,
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
programs,
they
are
very
much
interrelated,
but
this
welfare
program
primarily
is
for
children.
you
cannot
get
this
kind
of
welfare,
unless
you
have
a
child.
on
the
other
hand,
unemployment
insurance
is
for
parents.
it
is
fact
that
you
have
children,
do
not
have
children
really
makes
very
little
difference
as
to
what
kind
of
benefit
amount
you
can
get.
unemployment
insurance
is
for
parents,
afdc
is
for
children
basically.
unemployment
insurance
gives
money
based
upon
employers’
contributions,
welfare.
afdc
gives
it
based
upon
tax
revenues.
i
can
very
well
see,
a
rational
congress
saying
“if
this
man
committed
misconduct,
his
employer
should
not
have
to
pay
his
keep
on
employment
insurance,
for
13
weeks
or
26
weeks
or
whatever,
after
he
has
been
kicked
off
the
job.”
that
makes
sense.
welfare
program,
that
is
for
children,
incidentally,
also
welfare
programs
have
very
few
fault
concepts
in
them.
normally
speaking,
we
do
not
try
to
blame
the
child
for
something
his
father
did.
it
maybe,
that
the
fathers
in
this
case
are
bad
fathers,
because
they
did
not
handle
their
work
job
in
a
correct
fashion.
but
typically,
the
welfare
programs
in
this
country
and
the
federal
programs
specifically
have
not
been
concerned
with
fault
in
that
sense.
unemployment
insurance
programs
have
that
--
mr.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct.
mr.
christopher
brown
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
christopher
brown
that
is
true,
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
christopher
brown
in
essence,
that
is
what
it
is.
and
in
the
typical
case
somebody
gets
laid
off
their
job,
there
is
a
30
day
waiting
period
in
this
case
incidentally.
you
have
to
wait
30
days
before
you
can
apply
to
this
program
and
most
states
also
require
you
to
go
to
the
unemployment
line
first
to
get
unemployment
compensation.
once
you
have
gotten
that,
you
can
come
back
try
to
get
afdc,
if
you
are
eligible
for
it.
there
are
similar
programs
but
they
have
significant
differences.
mr.
christopher
brown
there
are
time
limitations.
mr.
christopher
brown
that
is
correct.
and
those
limitations
on
unemployment
insurance
are
the
same
in
this
program
also.
the
men
in
this
class
have
to
report
regularly,
have
to
take
jobs
if
they
are
offered
jobs,
and
have
to
in
essence,
be
willing
to
work.
it
is
a
little
bit
of
legislative
history
that
says
“this
is
not
for
the
involuntarily
unemployed.”
i
think,
the
brief
points
it
out
quite
clearly
that
in
essence
what
they
are
saying
is
“you
cannot
reject
a
job,
a
bona
fide
job
offer
and
still
stay
in
this
program.
if
you
reject
it,
there
is
a
30
day
disqualification
period.
so,
if
one
of
the
fathers
in
this
case,
mr.
francis,
the
striker,
for
example,
if
he
rejected
another
job
that
the
state
offered
him,
he
will
be
disqualified
from
receiving,
having
his
children
receive
these
benefits
for
30
days.
mr.
christopher
brown
but
not
after
that,
unless
he
rejects
another
one.
mr.
christopher
brown
unless,
he
does
it
again.
some
argument
was
made
in
essence
by,
i
think,
the
chamber
of
commerce
that
somebody
who
is
on
strike,
is
in
essence
rejecting
a
job.
well,
he
may
--
let
us,
even
assume
that
he
did
reject
a
job
but
there
is
a
30
day
waiting
period
anyway.
so
there
will
be
an
overlap
between
the
disqualification
period
and
30
day
wait.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further
to
suggest.
mr.
christopher
brown
thank
you.
