justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
case
concerns
the
cooperative
federal
state
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children,
unemployed
fathers
program.
under
section
407
of
the
social
security
act,
the
secretary
of
haw
is
delegated
the
power
to
prescribe
standards
for
determining
what
constitutes
unemployment
under
that
program.
in
line
with
the
statute,
the
secretary
issued
a
regulation,
authorizing
participating
states
within
their
discretion
to
exclude
from
the
definition
of
an
unemployed
father,
one
whose
unemployment
resolves
from
participation
in
a
labor
dispute
or
who
is
unemployed
by
reason
of
conduct
or
circumstances
which
result
in
disqualification
under
the
state's
unemployment
compensation
law.
the
present
litigation
is
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
families
who
were
denied
benefits
under
this
program
under
a
maryland
rule
because
the
father's
unemployment
resulted
from
a
discharged
for
a
misconduct
or
involvement
in
a
strike
or
from
having
voluntarily
quit
his
job.
the
courts
below
held
that
the
federal
regulation
was
invalid
as
exceeding
the
secretary's
statutory
authority.
we
reverse
and
we
hold
that
the
regulation
is
a
proper
exercise
of
the
secretary's
statutory
authority
and
that
it
is
reasonable
because
the
statute
expressly
delegated
to
the
secretary
the
power
to
prescribe
standards.
a
reviewing
court
is
not
free
to
set
aside
the
regulation
because
it
would
have
interpreted
the
statute
in
a
different
manner
only
if
the
secretary
exceeds
his
statutory
authority
or
if
the
regulation
is
arbitrary
or
capricious,
or
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law
may
the
regulation
be
struck
down.
here,
the
secretary
incorporated
a
widely
applied
standard
for
unemployment,
an
exclusion
of
those
who
are
out
of
work
is
a
result
of
their
own
conduct,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
goal
of
the
program
namely
to
aid
families
of
the
involuntarily
unemployed.
we
further
hold
that
this
power
to
provide
standard
gives
the
secretary
sufficient
flexibility
to
recognize
local
options
including
the
option
of
denying
unemployment
compensation
benefits
to
participate
--
to
participants
in
a
labor
dispute.
it
is
true
that
the
congressional
purpose
was
to
promote
greater
uniformity
in
the
application
of
the
program.
that
goal,
however,
can
still
be
met
without
imposing
identical
standards
on
each
state.
i'm
authorized
to
save
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens.
