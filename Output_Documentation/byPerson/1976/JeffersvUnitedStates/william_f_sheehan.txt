mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
we
have
made
several
arguments
and
the
alternative,
any
one
of
which
is
in
our
view
sufficient
standing
alone
to
warrant
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
in
the
early
part
of
our
brief
we
explained
why
we
believe
that
under
this
court’s
analysis
in
the
iannelli
decision,
a
conspiracy
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
of
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
those
arguments
which
are
essentially
matters
of
statutory
construction
are
laid
out
fully
in
our
brief
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
move
on
directly
to
some
of
our
arguments
which
are
perhaps
more
conceptually
difficult.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
in
concert
with,
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
have
urged
that
that
statute
does
not
use
the
language
conspiracy,
does
not
use
the
language
of
agreement,
congress
knew
in
creating
this
act
how
to
use
those
words,
it
did
so
in
section
846
and
it
did
so
in
section
849,
it
did
not
do
so
in
section
848.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
that’s
probably
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
know
of
no
case
that
squarely
face
that
issue,
there
are
decisions
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
have
upheld
convictions
of
defendants
on
both
section
846
conspiracies
and
section
848
continuing
criminal
enterprise
convictions
charges.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
he
did
indeed.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
they
are
unclear,
they
adopt
neither.
the
first
of
the
remaining
arguments
that
i
would
like
to
touch
on
in
our
brief
is
perhaps
the
narrowest
of
those
arguments
and
that
is
that
the
petitioner
having
insisted
that
the
charges
against
him
not
be
tried
in
one
case
cannot
now
complain
that
they
were
in
keeping
with
his
wishes
tried
in
two
trials.
if
the
court
agrees
with
opposition
in
this
regard
then
it
will
be
necessary
to
decide
whether
a
conspiracy
is
in
fact
a
lesser
included
offense
of
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
that’s
right
you
can
decide
this
issue
even
assuming
that
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
the
indictment
charging
petition
with
the
conspiracy
and
the
indictment
charging
him
with
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
were
returned
on
the
same
day
by
the
same
grand
jury.
the
government
then
moved
to
consolidate
those
two
indictments
for
trial
in
one
case.
petitioner
however
objected,
he
argued,
i
am
reading
from
the
page
15
of
the
appendix,
this
is
his
objection
to
the
government’s
motion
to
consolidate,
that
consolidation
of
these
indictments
would
be
improper
in
this
case
for
the
reason
is
that
neither
the
parties
nor
the
charges
are
the
same.
he
said
at
page
18
of
the
appendix
that
the
government
was
attempting
to
consolidate
a
conspiracy
of
ten
defendants
with
a
substantive
offense
of
only
one
defendant.
he
said
to
add
a
substantive
defense
to
the
conspiracy
charge
would
only
confuse
the
jury,
and
he
concluded
on
page
23
of
the
appendix
that
consolidation
would
be
wrong
since
there
is
neither
an
identity
of
defendants
nor
an
identity
of
charges
in
the
two
indictments.
his
arguments
of
course
prevailed,
the
district
court
denied
the
government’s
motion
and
ordered
that
the
indictment
to
be
tried
separately
as
they
were.
prior
to
trial
in
the
instant
case
the
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
completely
reversing
his
position
and
now
arguing
that
the
government
was
at
fault
for
not
joining
all
the
charges
against
him
in
one
case,
this
is
at
page
29
of
the
appendix.
petitioner
also
argued
that
once
the
district
court
had
exceeded
to
his
request
that
the
indictments
to
be
tried
in
two
trials,
then
the
government
was
obliged,
petitioner
said,
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
elect
which
indictment
it
would
bring
to
trial
against
him
and
to
forego
prosecution
on
the
other.
that
motion
of
course
was
not
granted.
in
his
reply
brief
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
petitioner
now
takes
he
had
a
third
position.
he
argues
that
his
objection
to
the
government’s
motion
to
consolidate
has
been
misinterpreted
all
this
time.
he
says
at
page
5
of
his
reply
brief
that
he
was
objecting
not
to
trial
of
both
charges
together
in
a
single
trial
but
to
the
presence
of
the
other
conspiracy
defendants
in
the
same
case
with
him.
the
suggestion
in
short
is
that
the
petitioner
actually
wanted
all
of
the
charges
brought
against
him
in
a
single
case
involving
him
alone.
the
record
slightly
refutes
this.
it
is
true
that
in
the
objection,
in
his
objection
to
the
government’s
motion
to
consolidate,
the
petitioner
said
that
he
feared
that
the
evidence
of
a
word
x
of
his
co-conspirators
which
would
be
admissible
against
him
in
the
conspiracy
case
would
carry
over
and
prejudice
him
in
the
jury’s
mind
on
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge.
but
the
remedy
said
petitioner,
was
to
try
the
charges
separately,
not
to
try
him
alone
free
of
all
the
other
defendants,
indeed
if
the
charges
had
been
tried
separately
that
very
same
evidence
would
have
been
admissible.
the
evidence
of
his
co-conspirators
of
word
x
whether
or
not
they
were
named
as
co-defendants
in
a
case
charging
him
with
both
conspiracy
and
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
furthermore
the
docket
entries
in
the
two
cases
show
that
petitioner
never
wanted
both
charges
tried
together.
the
indictments
were
returned
on
march
18,
trial
on
the
conspiracy
charge
was
set
first
for
may
20,
trial
on
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
was
set
for
june
24.
in
early
april
the
government
moved
to
consolidate,
on
april
29,
petitioner
filed
his
objections
to
that
motion
and
the
hearing
was
held
on
april
30,
that
hearing
was
inconclusive,
it
was
continued
over
to
may
7,
and
between
that
first
half
--
the
first
part
of
that
hearing
on
may
30,
and
the
second
on
may
7,
the
petitioner
moved
to
postpone
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
from
its
initial
date
of
june
24
over
to
august
12,
that
motion
was
granted,
that
was
not
we
submit
the
action
of
one
who
wanted
to
go
to
trial
on
both
charges
in
a
single
case.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
we
think
that
the
petitioner
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
does
a
defendant
who
secures
in
the
middle
of
his
trial,
a
mistrial
or
who
consents
to
a
mistrial.
indeed
we
think
the
petitioner
stands
roughly
in
the
same
posture
vis-à-vis
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
as
the
defendant
who
appeals
his
conviction
to
get
a
new
trial.
now,
the
reason
that
a
new
trial
is
permitted
now
withstanding
the
jeopardy
is
already
attached.
whenever
a
defendant
requests
a
mistrial
or
consents
to
one…
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no,
it
is
not
important
the
jeopardy
attached,
what
is
important
is
that
the
petitioner
retain
primary
control
over
the
course
to
be
followed.
that
is
the
reason
why
for
example
when
a
case
has
already
started
before
the
jury
and
the
defendant
requests
a
mistrial
he
can
be
tried
again.
this
court
has
explained
that
result
not
so
much
in
terms
of
waiver
which
the
court
has
held
that
traditional
waiver
concepts
are
not
particularly
relevant
under
double
jeopardy
analysis,
what
is
important
is
that,
the
defendant
in
this
case
the
petitioner
retains
primary
control
over
the
course
to
be
followed.
in
this
case
that
happened,
the
government
wanted
one
trial,
petitioner
wanted
two,
he
retained
primary
control.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
there
were
two
trials
that
were
scheduled,
one
for
may
and
one
for
june.
the
government
moved
to
consolidate
them;
the
petitioner
opposed
that
consolidation
that
is
pretty
close
to
saying
he
wanted
two
trials
that
seems
to
me.
he
wanted
the
status
quo
maintained,
that
was
two
trials.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
do
not
use
either
of
those
labels.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
i
think
that
the
established
legal
doctrine
that
permits
for
example,
a
retrial
after
defendant
requests
a
mistrial.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
this
court
has
declined
to
call
it
a
waiver
or
an
estoppel
although
the
concepts
are
quite
similar.
the
word
“waiver”
connotes
for
example
the
johnson
against
zerbst
standard
and
the
court
has
consistently
refused
to
adopt
that
standard
in
cases
involving
a
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
i
think
the
result
and
the
concept
is
essentially
the
same.
the
defendant
got
what
he
wanted.
for
him
now
to
say
that
he
is
immunized
from
prosecution
on
the
second
charge,
when
the
government
wanted
to
go
forward
with
both
charges
together
in
one
trial
perhaps
that
can
be
said
to
have
stopped
him
or
that
he
waived
in
any
event
his
control
over
the
proceedings
now
disables
him
from
claiming
protection
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
he
was
going
to
go
to
two
trials.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
he
pleaded
not
guilty
and
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
no
trials,
but
that
certainly
is
not
a
protection
granted
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
we
are
not
punishing
him;
we
are
trying
to
avoid
the
governments
being
punished
with
the
district
courts
granting
his
motion
to
try
these
cases
separately
when
the
government
wanted
to
try
them
together.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
if
we
had
not
moved
to
consolidate
would
he
be
in
the
same
position
he
is
in
now?
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
he
insisted
though
on
two
trials.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
the
government
could
have
returned
these
two
charges
against
the
petitioner
in
a
two
count
indictment
presumably
and
presumably
at
that
point,
the
petitioner
would
have
moved
to
sever
the
counts
and
presumably
the
district
court
would
have
been
persuaded
by
his
arguments.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no,
we
made
the
motion
for
one
trial,
we
tried
to
bring
these
two
counts,
these
charges
against
him
in
a
single
trial,
the
only
reason
they
have
resulted
in
two
trials
was
because
the
petitioner
insisted
that
they
take
place
in
two
trials.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
think
that
is
his
argument
that
is
his
argument.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
we
do
not
think
the
government
was
prohibited
from
going
to
trial
on
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise,
even
assuming
into
greater
offence.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
he
was
tried
for
the
conspiracy
first.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
the
government
thought
to
bring
those
cases,
tried
to
bring
them
jointed.
the
government
has
never
taken
the
position
that
they
are
lesser
and
greater
included
offences,
they
are
trying
to
bring
them
together.
now,
let
us
assume
they
are
greater
unless
they
are
offences
then
the
result
of
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
whenever
a
defendant
is
charged
with
an
offence
that
can
be
broken
down
on
a
lesser
included
offence
and
can
persuade
the
district
court
to
order
the
government
to
try
the
lesser
included
offence
separately
from
the
grader
and
the
lesser
included
offence
first
then
he
is
there
after
immunized
from
prosecution
on
the
greater
offence.
we
submit
that.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
do
not
know
why
he
would
have
--
i
do
not
why
speedy
trial
considerations
--
no
i
think
speedy
trial
considerations
would
militate
in
favor
of
both
charges
being
tried
in
the
single
trial
together
rather
than
separating
them.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
think
if
there
were
substantial
lapse
of
time
in
the
two
indictments
even
in
that
case
to
try
both
charges
together
would
bring
both
charges
to
trial
and
to
combination
at
the
soonest
moment
possible.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
the
record
does
not
show
that,
but
i
think
that
we
can
make
some
inferences
from
the
record.
the
conspiracy
trial
was
set
first
for
may
20th
and
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
for
june
24th.
on
may
7th
when
the
district
court
refused
to
grant
the
government’s
motion
to
consolidate,
but
that
time
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
have
been
pushed
off
to
august
12th.
now,
by
that
time
also
there
were
some
75
docket
entries
in
the
conspiracy
case
involving
ten
defendants,
involving
all
of
those
defendants.
substantial
pretrial
activity
had
already
taken
place
and
that
trial
was
always
scheduled
to
go
first
and
it
involved
ten
defendants
that
made
sense
for
it
to
go
first.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no,
and
in
fact
if
the
defendant
wanted
to
have
a
lesser
included
offence
and
a
greater
offence
tried
separately
in
most
cases
it
would
make
sense
to
try
the
lesser
first,
because
if
you
try
the
greater
first
that
would
by
definition
include
trial
of
the
lesser,
unless
the
jury
got
some
sort
of
special
instruction.
well,
i
was
saying
that
petitioner's
action
in
this
case,
puts
him
in
the
same
positions
as
one
who
request
the
mistrial
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
would
say
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
prohibit
successive
trials
as
long
as
the
defendant
was
never
twice
in
jeopardy
on
the
same
offence.
he
would
have
the
protection
of
the
due
process
clause
if
it
appeared
that
successive
prosecutions
by
the
government
were
for
no
good
reasons
out
to
harass
the
defendant
something
along
that
line.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
oh
yes.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
oh
well,
i
certainly
did
not
mean
it
to
be,
and
the
trial,
in
the
example
that
you
put,
at
the
trial
on
i
think
you
said
men
slaughter.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
it
would
be
in
these
circumstances
at
the
trial
for
men
slaughter
the
defendant
was
not
in
jeopardy
of
conviction
or
punishment
on
the
first
degree
murder
charge.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
right,
and
the
trial
in
the
first
degree
murder
charge,
the
defendant
could
not
be
allowed
to
be
placed
in
jeopardy
for
conviction
of
the
lesser
included
offense
of
men
slaughter
and
if
you
were
convicted
on
the
greater
any
punishment
that
he
had
received
on
the
lesser,
would
have
to
be
given
credit.
this
i
think
is
the
diaz
case.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
i
understand,
i
think
that
the
diaz
case
stands
for
the
broader
preposition
and
in
the
narrow
effects
in
which
it
was
decided.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
provided
that,
yes
it
could
be
tried
on
the
indictment
for
first
degree
murder.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
you
will
have
to
avoid
a
couple
of
punishment.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
give
him
any
credit
there.
i
do
say
that
the
due
process
clause
would
protect
the
defendant
against
vexatious
prosecution.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
probably
the
due
process
clause
would
prohibit
that
series
of
prosecution.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
not
so
long
as
he
has
never
twice
placed
in
jeopardy
on
the
same
offence.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no,
i
think
those
are
not
the
same
offences
under
the
blockburger
test,
i
think
that
prosecution
will
be
perfectly
permissible,
i
think
the
situation
you
just
hypothesized
does
not
involve
greater
and
lesser
included
offence.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that
is
correct
it
does
not,
it
is
---
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
it
is
a
formula
for
identifying
the
identity
of
offences.
well,
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
i
thought
that
the
diaz
case
stands
for
the
broad
proposition
than
i
have
just
advanced,
at
the
very
least
i
submit,
it
stands
for
the
narrower
preposition
that
prosecution
on
the
greater
offence
can
be
had
following
conviction
on
a
lesser
included
offence.
whenever
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
the
lesser
included
offence
the
government
for
good
reason,
was
not
able
to
charge
the
greater
offence.
thus
for
example,
if
the
greater
crime,
has
not
yet
actually
been
committed
when
the
lesser
is
tried
as
in
the
diaz
case
or
for
example
if
the
defendant
can
conceal
the
full
extend
of
his
crime
from
the
government
so
that
the
government
does
not
know
the
greater
offence
has
been
committed
when
the
lesser
is
tried
or
as
in
the
present
case,
if
the
government
is
prohibited
by
order
of
court
from
trying
both
cases
together,
then
we
submit
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
prosecution
for
the
greater
offence,
provided
of
course
that
there
was
a
conviction
on
the
lesser
included
offence
and
provided
that
any
punishment
that
he
has
suffered
from
the
lesser
offence
be
credited.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no
it
was
not,
but
since
the
government
do
not
believe
it
was
a
greater
offence
of
being
that
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no,
it
certainly
was
not,
the
defendant
had
argued
quite
strongly
different
cases.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no,
but
we
continue
to
believe
that
they
are
not
greater
or
lesser
included
offence.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
let
us
assume
that
we
knew
that
there
was
an
issue,
it
would
still
make
sense
to
try
the
less
and
first
i
submit
especially
since
the
lesser
offence
involved
ten
defendants.
but
there
was
no
issue
raised
about
which
trial
would
go
first.
the
conspiracy
was
always
set
to
go
first.
furthermore,
when
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
cases
that
could
not
be
consolidated,
it
had
already
ruled
against
us
and
the
cases
were
even
bore
such
a
close
resemblance
to
each
other
that
they
were
appropriate
for
consolidation.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
that
is
right
that
is
right.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that
is
correct.
opposition
i
think
fully
respects
the
policies
that
underlie
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
two
prosecutions
in
the
situation
such
as
i
have
just
described,
do
not
represent
judge
shopping
by
the
prosecution,
in
order
to
secure
sentence
that
the
government
seeks
--
that
appears
to
be
appropriate
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
government
alone,
nor
do
they
represent
an
effort
by
the
government
to
try
a
defendant
repeatedly
until
the
conviction
has
obtained,
contradicting
earlier
acquitals
and
perhaps
casting
doubt
on
the
integrity
of
earlier
trials.
it
is
true
that
the
defendant
may
live
in
a
continuing
state
of
anxiety
that
he
will
someday
be
tried
for
the
greater
offence,
but
if
the
defendant
is
concealed
the
full
extend
of
this
crime,
or
if
as
here
he
himself
requests
two
trials
that
anxiety
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
caused
by
any
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
government.
as
i
mentioned
earlier
our
position
does
not
leave
a
defendant
at
the
mercy
of
a
prosecutor
who
would
carve
up
in
offence
into
a
series
of
underlying
offences
and
bring
a
series
of
vexatious
prosecutions,
up
the
ladders
it
is
said.
the
due
process
clause
fully
protects
the
defendant
from
such
governmental
conduct
even
if
because
he
is
never
twice
put
in
jeopardy,
he
cannot
claim
protection
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
if
they
had
put
both
counts
in
the
same
indictment,
yes
i
think
he
could
have
moved
to
sabre
the
counts.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
i
think
i
would
presume
that
he
would
have,
i
presume
these
objections
to
going
to
trial
and
both
of
those
charges
together
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
so
we
would
come
out
the
same.
indeed,
for
example
suppose
the
district
court
had
granted
our
order
and
it
had
gone
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
petitioner
in
the
court
of
appeals
had
argued
that
that
notion
to
consolidate
had
been
improperly
granted
by
the
district
court
and
the
appellate
court
accepted
this
position
and
sent
it
back
for
a
new
trial,
a
separate
trial
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
i
think
the
defendant
would
be
hard
put
to
say
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
barred
that
trial.
i
think
he
is
in
the
same
position,
as
he
would
have
been
in
persuading
the
court
of
appeals
to
order
two
trials
as
he
is
today
having
persuaded
the
district
court
to
order
two
trials.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
he
said
that
he
feared
that
the
evidence
of
his
co-conspirators'
overt
acts
would
come
in
and
that
would
carry
over,
but
that
evidence
would
be
admissible.
if
he
was
tried
in
one
trial
on
both
the
conspiracy
and
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise,
the
evidence
of
his
co-conspirators'
overt
acts
would
be
admissible
against
him
on
the
conspiracy
charge,
even
if
they
were
not
named
as
co-defendants
that
requires
an
instruction
by
the
district
court
to
the
jury
that
they
should
not
consider
the
evidence
of
overt
acts
on
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge.
now,
the
petitioner
argues
that
our
position
is
foreclosed
by
this
court’s
decisions
in
waller
against
florida
and
robinson
against
neil.
those
cases
in
our
view,
do
not
hold
the
prosecution
for
greater
offence
is
always
barred
by
an
earlier
conviction
on
a
lesser
included
offence.
indeed
that
issue
was
not
raised
or
argued
in
those
cases.
they
involved
the
question
whether
a
municipality
and
the
state
with
dual
sovereigns
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
holding
that
they
were
not,
the
court
cannot
be
said
to
have
passed
upon
or
resolve
the
questions
presented
here.
if
those
questions
had
been
presented
and
passed,
if
those
questions
had
been
resolved
in
waller
or
in
robinson,
then
presumably
the
court
could
have
decided
blackledge
against
perry
on
double
jeopardy
grounds,
and
presumably
the
court
or
perhaps
the
court
would
not
have
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
case
to
be
argued
next
brown
against
ohio.
i
think
that
the
issue
was
an
open
one,
i
think
this
is
the
first
time
it
is
presented
to
the
court
and
i
would
repeat
enclosing
that
the
due
process
clause
is
available
to
prevent
the
prosecutor
from
carving
up
crimes
and
bringing
a
series
of
prosecutions
for
no
good
reason.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
however
applies
only
when
a
defendant
is
twice
put
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offence.
