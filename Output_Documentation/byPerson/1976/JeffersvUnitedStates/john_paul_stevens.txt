justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bower,
isn't
there
one
possible
exception
to
that,
a
government
suggests
that
the
five
or
more
persons
could
be
innocent
dukes
of
mr.
jeffers,
and
if
one
can
read
the
statutory
language
in
concert
with
is
including
innocent
employees,
innocent
dukes
then
your
argument
would
fail
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
mr.
bower
just
so,
you
would
agree
that
if
the
statute
were
read
as
an
innocent
dukes
statute
then
there
would
be
no
lesser
included
offense.
your
point
as
i
understand
it
is,
that
is
manifestly
unreasonable
reading
of
the
statute.
