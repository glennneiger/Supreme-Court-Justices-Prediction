mr.
stephen
c.
bower
mr.
chief
justice
and
please
the
court.
garland
jeffers
became
involved
in
dealing
in
narcotics
in
gary,
indiana
in
and
around
november
1971.
he
and
about
four-five
of
his
friends
who
were
all
around
his
age
that
is
around
21
years
of
age
met
and
began
a
pattern
of
drug-related
activities.
they
engaged
in
robberies
in
which
they
stole
drugs
from
other
dope
pushers
on
the
street.
they
extorted
money
from
other
drug
dealers
for
them
to
be
able
to
continue
an
operation
within
the
city
of
gary
and
they
themselves
engaged
in
distribution
of
heroine
and
cocaine.
jeffers
role
in
this
drug
operation
which
lasted
from
november
1971
through
the
time
of
the
indictment
on
march
18,
1974
was
admittedly
one
of
at
least
a
supervisor;
he
began
as
treasurer
and
after
a
certain
period
of
time
literally
became
the
head
of
the
drug
operation.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
i
think
he
took
it
your
honor.
mr.
jeffers
is
apparently
a
very
dynamic
and
forceful
individual,
and
has
efficient
number
of
friends
that
were
willing
to
assist
him
in
taking
over
this
where
there
has
this
position
in
occupation.
what
happened,
your
honor,
was
to
focus
to
the
court
that
all
of
the
activities
involved
in
the
case
presently
before
the
court
occurred
in
gary,
indiana
and
part
of
them
in
chicago.
there
was
one
family
drug
ring
in
gary.
it
went
over
a
period
of
two-and-a-half
years
and
at
one
time
or
another
there
were
over
50
different
individuals
actively
involved
in
the
operation.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
this
was
the
name
i
have
given
to
this
operation,
justice
rehnquist,
they
call
it,
the
family.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
it
doesn’t
to
me
your
honor;
it
was
nicknamed
by
the
press
as
the
family
and
basically
went
by
that
name.
the
reason
to
point
out
this
background
your
honor
is
to
emphasize
that
our
issue
today
has
to
do
with
jeffers’
multiple
prosecution
of
separate
drug
violations
under
the
federal
law.
the
evidence
presented
at
jeffers’
first
trial
which
was
for
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
heroin
and
cocaine
is
basically
the
same
evidence
presented
in
his
second
trial
which
is
on
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
i
point
this
out
to
the
court
at
the
beginning
so
that
there
is
no
confusion
that
we
are
not
talking
about
any
type
of
multiple
drug
conspiracies,
separate
drug
rings
or
any
confusion
concerning
what
evidence
was
presented
in
both
the
lower
court
cases.
the
government
has
never
contented
nor
could
they
in
fact
contend
that
the
evidence
used
at
the
first
trial
and
the
evidence
used
at
the
second
trial
wasn’t
from
the
same
witnesses
and
wasn’t
from
the
same
series
of
transactions.
alright,
a
resume
of
the
prosecutions
were
like
this.
on
march
18,
1974,
garland
jeffers
and
nine
others
were
indicted
in
hammon
criminal
74-56
with
conspiracy
to
distribute
heroin.
on
the
same
date
in
a
companion
indictment,
jeffers
by
himself
was
indicted
with
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
under
848.
alright,
upon
request
of
the
government
the
conspiracy
case
was
set
for
trial.
objections
were
filed
to
the
--
government
then
filed
a
motion
for
trial
together
of
the
conspiracy
case
and
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
objections
were
filed
by
the
attorney
representing
all
of
the
defendants
in
the
conspiracy
case
arguing
that
the
presence
of
jeffers
in
the
court
room
on
a
continued
criminal
enterprise
with
prejudice
that
the
other
various
defendants
in
the
conspiracy
and
the
jeffers
argued
that
the
presence
of
the
other
nine
defendants
in
the
conspiracy
would
jeopardize
his
right
to
a
free
trial.
the
trial
court
saw
fit
not
to
allow
consolidation
which
left
the
record
that
jeffers
had
pending
against
him
a
conspiracy
charge
and
pending
also
in
a
separate
indictment
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge.
the
government
then
went
to
trial
on
the
conspiracy
charge
and
convicted
jeffers
of
conspiracy
distribute
heroin
and
he
received
a
15-year
jail
sentence.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
yes.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
he
pushed
for
no
trial
together,
your
honor,
they
were
not
joined.
it
was
not
a
request
for
a
severance.
the
government
had
seen
fit
to
return
two
indictments
and
then
sought
to
try
them
together.
jeffers
and
others
opposed
the
trial
consolidation.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
i
think
it
would,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
this
situation
is
entirely
different
for
one
very
obvious
reason.
the
government
at
any
time
had
the
option
to
sever
jeffers
from
the
conspiracy
trial
and
try
him
later
on
the
conspiracy
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
trial
at
one
time.
that
is
the
big
distinction
here.
these
two
indictments
were
not
joined
and
the
request
was
for
the
government
to
join
the
two
of
them
together.
in
other
words,
the
first
trial
took
place,
the
government
still
had
an
option
before
trying
him
on
a
conspiracy
to
sever
him
from
the
conspiracy
and
attempt
to
try
him
together
later
on
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
well,
my
response
should
be
no,
and
is
no.
i
would
suggest
that
we
file
justice
powell’s
footnote
17
and
18
in
iannelli
and
instruct
the
jury
as
follows
that
they
should
not
consider
the
conspiracy
charge
against
jeffers
unless
they
find
him
not
guilty
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
and
should
only
consider
the
conspiracy
charge
if
they
find
him
not
guilty
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
alright,
the
jeffers
prior
to
the
second
trial
in
fact
raised
the
double
jeopardy
claim
by
a
motion
for
dismissal.
in
that
dismissal
he
alleged
that
the
evidence
to
be
used
against
him
would
be
the
same
and
asserted
prior
to
the
second
trial
that
conspiracy
was
lesser
included
offense
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
it
appears
to
me
to
the
court
that
the
first
big
crucial
step
that
must
be
taken
by
jeffers
in
order
to
substantiate
his
violation
of
double
jeopardy
rights
is
whether
or
not
conspiracy
to
distribute
heroin
is
a
lesser
included
offense
in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge.
jeffers
submit
and
argues
to
the
court
that
it
is.
the
standard
definition
of
a
conspiracy
briefly
stated,
simply
an
agreement
between
two
or
more
that
by
concerted
action
to
accomplish
a
criminal
purpose.
it
is
jeffers’
contention
that
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
under
section
848
means
that
a
person,
or
person
has
to
undertake
a
series
of
violation
of
federal
drug
law
and
that
they
have
to
be
undertaken
in
concert
with
five
or
more
people
with
whom
he
occupies
a
position
as
supervisor
or
manager
and
for
what
he
derives
substantial
income.
the
crucial
statutory
definition,
the
jeffers
contends
is
controlling
is
that
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
requires
that
the
series
of
drug
violations
to
be
taken
in
concert
with
five
or
more.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
in
concert
can
only
mean
that
there
has
been
an
agreement
in
design
and
plan
and
that
this
is
a
basic
definition
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
two
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
five
your
honor.
well,
five
or
six
right,
jeffers
himself
with
five
others.
the
government
has
taken
a
possession
that
iannelli
controls
this
case
and
the
fact
that
this
honorable
court
found
in
iannelli
that
the
gambling
offense
was
not
phrased
in
terms
of
the
conspiracy
statute
or
that
to
gambling
offense
did
not
require
an
agreement,
therefore
they
were
separate.
the
slight
difference
in
phraseology
as
appears
in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
should
not
be
controlling.
i
submit
your
honor
that
it
is
controlling.
the
reason
why
is
that
if
the
government’s
possession
is
correct,
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
find
that
the
phrase
in
concert
as
appears
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
must
be
interpreted
to
mean
not
in
concert.
it
is
jeffers’
possession
that
a
conspiracy
is
an
essential
basic
element
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise,
and
as
such
if
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge
is
proven
a
conspiracy
will
in
fact
be
proven.
therefore,
jeffers’
contends
that
if
he
is
tried
and
convicted
on
a
lesser
included
offense
of
conspiracy,
he
may
not
be
prosecuted
subsequently
on
a
greater
offense
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
to
the
first
and
to
the
second.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
yes
it
is.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
that
is
right.
it
is
lesser
included,
your
honor,
because
of
the
standard
definitions
concerning
a
lesser
include
to
the
effect
that
the
greater
offense
cannot
be
committed
without
in
fact
having
a
lesser
offense
committed.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
section
848
continuing
criminal
enterprise
section,
in
this
definition
when
it
says
a
series
of
drug
violations
must
be
undertaken
in
concert
with
five
or
more
of
necessity
requires…
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
justice
stevens
i
see
no
way
that
that
can
be
done
because
when
you
use
the
phrase
“in
concert”,
there
is
got
to
be
an
agreement
in
design
or
plan,
not
only
joint
action,
but
they
have
to
agree
as
to
the
in,
the
in
is
the
illegal
drug
distribution.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
yes
to
both
questions.
the
concept
of
in
concert,
perhaps
best
can
be
pointed
out
by
an
analogy,
in
that
if
you
call
the
boston
pops
orchestra
together
formed
to
play
in
concert
they
are
all
jointly
acting,
but
you
wouldn’t
expect
each
individual
musician
to
be
playing
a
different
song.
the
“in
concert”
requires
not
only
joined
action
but
an
agreement
as
to
the
in,
agreement
is
the
design
or
scheme.
the
argument
that
innocent
dukes
such
as
hired
messenger
boys
to
make
delivery,
they
are
not
part
of
any
conspiracy
or
drug
ring
at
all,
unless
they
are
aware
of
what
the
goals
are,
they
are
aware
that
they
are
delivering
heroin
then
they
are
part
of
the
agreement.
then
they
are
part
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise.
so
i
think
that
even
though
the
government
contends
that
jeffers
could
be
convicted
if
there
were
five
innocent
dukes,
i
would
say
that
this
could
not
be
under
the
meeting
of
the
statute.
it
requires
five
other
individuals
actively
participating
in
the
drug
operation,
and
in
fact
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
what
was
present
in
this
case.
there
were
no
innocent
dukes.
the
prosecutions
against
the
variety
of
the
family
members,
the
drug
ring
members
all
show
that
they
were
aware
and
participated
in.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
because
in
fact
a
conspiracy
could
be
committed
with
only
two
people
as
opposed
to
five,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
basically
that
was
not
election
of
congress
when
they
outlined.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
the
conspiracy
is
the
lesser
included,
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
is
the
greater
for
several
reasons,
one,
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
has
a
great
amount
of
additional
elements
that
required
to
be
proven
beside
the
conspiracy,
besides
the
in
concert
action
with
five
or
more,
they
got
to
show
he
was
a
supervisor,
they
got
to
show
he
receives
substantial
income.
i
would
point
out,
two,
that
supports
this
is
the
fact
that
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
carries
by
far
the
heavier
penalty.
on
first
offense
it
is
ten
years
to
life
non-suspendible.
on
the
conspiracy
charge,
if
it
is
conspiracy
to
distribute
it
is
up
to
the
same
as
a
substantive
offense
for
15
years.
so
it
seems
evident
that
congress
in
writing
848,
continuing
criminal
enterprise
statute
in
imposing
such
a
heavy
penalty,
penalty
intended
to
cover
the
evils
that
are
present
from
conspiratorial
behavior.
so,
not
only
do
the
penalties
but
the
language
of
the
statute
strongly
suggest
that
conspiracy
is
in
fact
included.
i
would
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
iannelli
and
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
court’s
treatment
in
the
iannelli
case
warns
jeffers’
double
jeopardy
claim
been
sustained,
and
iannelli,
justice
powell’s
opinion
in
footnote
17
and
18
discuss
concept
of
blockburger
and
the
concept
of
whether
or
not
in
the
iannelli
case
gambling
offense,
1955
gambling
offense
required
an
agreement
or
conspiracy
as
part
of
the
offense.
this
court
specifically
found
in
iannelli
that
the
gambling
offense
did
not
require
conspiracy.
jeffers
case
is
the
other
side
of
that.
in
jeffers
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
does
in
fact
require
conspiratorial
activity,
it
requires
action
in
concert.
therefore,
applying
iannelli
to
jeffers
it
is
logical
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
jeffers’
rights
of
double
jeopardy
have
been
violated
by
the
multiple
prosecution.
i
would
reserve…
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
government
takes
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
i
simply
comment
that
i
do
not
feel
that
that
is
the
current
status
of
the
law
before
this
court.
i
know
of
no
case
holding
in
which
they
have
allowed
conviction
of
the
lesser
followed
by
a
subsequent
prosecution
for
the
greater
except
in
those
rare
instances
such
as
diaz
in
which
there
was
a
conviction
for
some
type
of
assault,
the
victim
later
died
and
then
a
re-indictment
on
a
--
i
believe
a
manslaughter.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
well
jeffers’
contend
to
robinson
v.
neil
and
waller
v.
florida
impliedly
state
that
this
court
has
adopted
a
lesser
included
offense
rule.
this
court’s
action
in
both
those
cases
for
remaining
purposes
of
determination
of
whether
or
not
it
was
the
same
offense
impliedly
except
the
less
include
offense
rule
because
in
robinson
you
had
destruction
of
public
property
and
then
a
subsequent
theft
charge
and
waller
a
similar
situation.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
well
your
honor,
it
is
obvious
that
they
were
not
identical
by
title,
in
other
words,
the
same
exact
offense.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
no,
i
would
point
out
and
i
have
in
my
brief
that
link
that
robinson
v.
neil
are
remand
from
this
court.
i
did
discuss
to
that
link
and
basically
stated
that
the
lesser
included
offense
rule
should
control
the…
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
now
that
was
the
district
court,
your
honor…
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
no
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
yes,
if
it
is
not
clearly
been
held,
i
urge
the
court
to
do
so
in
this
instance.
it
seems
that
to
allow
stair-step
prosecution
from
the
lesser
to
the
greater
offense.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor,
it
is
double
prosecution.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
right,
only
a
multiple
prosecution…
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
oh,
certainly.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
well
i
don’t
know
if
you
could
stretch
edge
to
that
or
not,
it
would
depend.
quite
frankly
it
is
very
difficult
to
apply
that
case
because
you
would
not
know
for
sure
the
reason
for
not
guilty
especially
in
a
complex
conspiracy
trial,
you
would
have
no
idea.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
i
would
have
filed
the
same
motion,
your
honor,
double
jeopardy.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
yes,
i
really
doubt
it.
it
may
even
be
more
difficult,
because
you
would
not
be
able
to
identify,
if
you
try
to
apply
edge
to
it,
you
would
have
a
difficult
time
because
how
would
you
show
to
this
honorable
court
the
reason
for
the
not
guilty.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
mr.
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
direct
my
rebuttal
time
directly
to
the
allege
waiver
issue,
and
i
must
agree
with
justice
stevens
when
he
queried
the
government’s
representative
as
to
whether
or
not
this
in
fact
is
in
the
stopper
or
a
waiver
argument.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
i
would
call
it,
judge
your
honor
a
waiver
with
a
small
w,
i
do
not
think
there
has
been
a
name
for
it,
we
must
agree
with
mr.
sheehan
in
this
sense,
since
then
i
find
no
problems
with
the
retrial
after
a
granted
motion
for
mistrial
when
made
by
the
defendant,
and
quite
frankly
i
do
not
see
how
it
is
controlling
here,
and
the
reason
why
is
that
in
this
case
there
was
a
ten
defendant
conspiracy
indictment,
and
the
objections
to
the
consolidation
were
filed
one
by
all
of
the
defendants.
the
pleading
is
in
the
file,
is
in
the
appendix,
much
of
the
argument
in
there
is
by
the
other
remaining
defendants
and
not
wanting
to
be
tried
with
jeffers
on
the
continued
criminal
enterprise
trial.
jeffers
argument
also,
may
it
please
to
court
on
page
20
points
out
that
he
is
talking
about
a
steamroller
effect
upon
the
minds
of
the
jury,
the
sheer
aggregate
of
evidence
have
massed
by
the
government
and
provided
to
the
jury
would
create
an
inference
of
criminal
disposition,
based
upon
mere
association
with
other
defendants
with
whom
the
evidence
is
stronger.
so
what
we
have
is
a
standard
assertion
that
all
of
the
defendants
will
not
receive
a
fair
trial
by
this
prejudicial
joiner
or
this
trial
together.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
united
states
versus
simmons
holds
that
you
cannot
panelize
the
exercise
of
a
constituently
protected
right
by
requiring
an
order
to
exercise
that
you
must
waive
another
right.
the
government
would
ask
this
court
to
rule
that
when
jeffers,
including
the
other
nine
defendants
in
the
conspiracy,
when
jeffers
sought
to
prevent
the
trial
together,
which
is
a
sixth
amendment
right
to
have
a
fair
trial,
he
of
necessity
had
to
waive
fifth
amendment
rights
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
steven’s
comments
or
question
to
the
government,
is
this
a
waiver
of
constitutional
rights.
i
submit
that
for
the
court
to
rule
there
is
a
waiver,
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
double
jeopardy
rights
of
fifth
amendment
rights
and
that
the
record
is
simply
absent
in
showing
the
type
of
knowing
intelligent
and
voluntary
waiver
that
is
required
of
a
basic
fundamental
constitutional
right.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
the
continued
criminal
enterprise
required
more
proof
especially
concerning
income
your
honor,
but
the
conspiracy
evidence
was
identical,
as
a
matter
of
fact…
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
concerning
jeffers,
no
your
honor,
the
government
accords
with
a
multi-defendant
conspiracy
would
have
to
prove
tie
in
of
each
defendant
into
the
conspiracy
that
was
not
required
in
the
jeffers
case,
but
also
jeffers
had
to
be
tied
in.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
that
is
right,
and
here.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
right,
you
have
got
a
question
of
intent.
in
this
instance,
if
i
may
go
back
to
the
waiver,
we
do
not
know
why
the
trial
court
refused
to
grant
the
motion
for
trial
together
and
i
must
point
out
that
jeffers
did
not
object
or
did
not
take
a
stance
that
they
could
never
be
a
trial
together,
what
he
claimed
was
that
there
will
be
prejudicial
joinder
if
the
ten
defendant
conspiracy
was
tied
with
the
continued
criminal
enterprise.
now
when
the
trial
court
granted
his
objections,
the
government
was
in
this
position.
they
had
a
pending
conspiracy
charge
against
him
and
a
pending
continued
criminal
enterprise.
the
government
then
was
the
one
that
proceeded
the
trial
on
the
conspiracy
first.
jeffers
did
not
cause
demand
or
was
responsible
for
the
conspiracy
trial
being
tried
first.
the
government
had
a
very
simple
option.
they
could
have
moved
to
(inaudible)
jeffers
from
the
conspiracy
trial
and
tried
him
with
the
continued
criminal
enterprise
later.
what
i
am
submitting
to
the
court
is
that
jeffers
actions
in
seeking
a
fair
trial
free
of
prejudicial
joinder
in
no
way
can
be
interpreted
or
should
in
no
way
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
he
had
forever
waive
double
jeopardy
rights.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
most
assuredly,
and
i
would
suggest
that
justice
powell
in
iannelli
in
footnote
17
and
18
pointed
out
the
proper
procedure
and
i
reiterated
to
the
court
that
that
is
the
way
they
handle
it,
and
that
is
a
very
practical,
sensible
way
to
handle
it,
because
the
penalty
for
continued
criminal
enterprise
obviously
covers
the
evil
sought
to
be
prohibited
by
a
conspiracy.
i
would
submit
that
at
least
justice
burger
has
recognized
that
the
same
evidence
rule
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
import.
i
would
suggest
also
to
the
court
that
if
this
court
recognizes
the
same
evidence
rule,
it
must
have
necessity,
follow
along
with
a
lesser
included
offence
rule
because
by
the
definition
set
forth
in
blockburger,
applying
it
to
the
case
at
bar
the
conspiracy
was
proven,
both
in
the
conspiracy
case
in
the
continued
criminal
enterprise,
the
only
additional
elements
in
the
continued
criminal
enterprise
had
to
do
with
jeffers
position
as
manager
and
the
fact
he
receives
substantial
income.
so
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
first
trial
in
conviction
on
the
conspiracy
as
a
lesser
included
offence
or
continued
criminal
enterprise
should
under
the
rules
of
double
jeopardy,
bar
subsequent
prosecution
for
the
continued
criminal
enterprise.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
correct.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
i
site
this
because
it
has
traditionally
been
viewed
and
used
by
lower
courts
for
these
purposes.
mr.
stephen
c.
bower
no,
but
i
think
if
there
is
any
doubt,
i
urge
this
court
to
adopt
it,
to
make
it
clear
that
we
have
this
constitutional
protection,
the
double
jeopardy
and
that
the
way
we
apply
it
is
through
the
same
evidence
test.
for
years,
cases
have
been
coming
before
this
court
concerning
with
same
evidence
versus
same
transaction,
and
the
courts
repeatedly
held
that
the
same
transaction
rule
is
not
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
meant
to
cover.
if
it
is
not
the
same
evidence
rule,
i
would
submit
we
have
no
viable
double
jeopardy
provision.
so
i
would
urge
the
court
that
the
lesser
included
offence
rule
is
simply
an
extension
of
the
save
(ph)
evidence
rule
that
that
if
not
elevated
to
constitutional
standards
by
this
court,
should
be
elevated
to
such
standard.
thank
you.
