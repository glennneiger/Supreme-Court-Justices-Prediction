unknown
speaker
there
are
really
three
basic
issues
in
this
case,
aren’t
they?
first
of
all,
is
conspiracy
a
lesser
included
offense
of
this
new
statutory
offense?
secondly,
if
so,
does
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibit
the
prosecution
on
the
greater
offense
after
conviction
of
a
lesser
included
offense?
and
thirdly,
if
so,
was
that
waived
in
this
case
by
your
client’s
motion
insisting
upon
severance
of
the
trial.
those
are
the
three
basic
issues
aren’t
they?
you
are
not
directing
yourself
to
the
first
or
have
been.
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
is
to
the
issue
to
which
you
are
not
directing
yourself.
unknown
speaker
tell
me
again,
how
criminal
act
under
a
statute
that
requires
at
least
five
is
the
lesser
included
offense
in
the
number
one
which
requires
only
two.
i
know
you
have
gone
over
that
but
it
will
help
me
if
you
would
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
bower
which
is
the
lesser
included
offense
under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
the
government
in
its
brief
says
that
even
if
you
are
right
the
conspiracy
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
this
new
statutory
offense.
nonetheless,
the
law
is
not
all
that
clear
that
violates
a
double
jeopardy
clause
to
try
somebody
for
the
greater
offense
after
conviction
of
the
lesser
included
offense.
unknown
speaker
yes
and
you
have
not
i
do
not
think
corrected
yourself
very
much
to
that.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
from
this
court
in
which
it
has
been
prohibited
on
grounds
of
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
real
question.
unknown
speaker
we
did
not
say
to
see
if
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense,
we
said
to
see
if
it
was
the
same
offense.
unknown
speaker
neither
of
those
opinions
in
this
court
discussed
this
issue
precisely
it
did
not.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
you
call
it
a
rule
and
i
am
wondering
where
you
get
the
rule,
certainly
not
precisely
for
many
cases
in
this
court,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
and
the
diaz
case
kind
of
looks
the
other
way,
that
case
of
course
being
distinguishable
on
the
ground
you
mentioned.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
a
question
of
double
punishment
too
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
what
you
are
focusing
on
the
double
jeopardy.
unknown
speaker
you
think
you’d
have
an
easier
case
that
has
had
been
in
the
acquittal?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
court
has
held
that,
hasn’t
it?
has
the
court
held
that
if
it
had
been
an
acquittal
on
the
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
if
it
had
been
an
acquittal
in
the
conspiracy
case
and
then
later
a
prosecution
for
the
continuing
criminal
offense?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
an
easier
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
have
an
easier
case
right
now,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
and
statute
is
based
on
the
difference
between
the
words
“in
concert
with”
and
“in
agreement
with”.
if
the
statute
said
“in
agreement
with”
you
would
concede
you
are
wrong.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
that
you
know
of
that
construes
the
words
“in
concert
with”
is
not
meaning
“in
agreement
with”?
unknown
speaker
i
have
not
read
those
other
than
judge
records
opinion
in
this
case
because
he
did
so
on
the
theory
that
they
were
the
same.
unknown
speaker
do
those
others
adopt
your
statutory
theory
or
do
they
adopt
his
theory
or
are
they
unclear?
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
we
decided
it
is,
that
argument
still
be
valid,
one
can...
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheehan
just
help
me
a
little
bit
on
this
argument,
are
you
arguing
estoppel
or
waiver,
what
is
exactly
the
legal
significance
of
the
fact
that
he
opposed
the
motion
of
consolidation
and
delayed
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
making
that
argument
you
are
saying
then
jeopardy
for
this
offense
did
attach
at
the
other
trial.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
did
he
ever
say
he
wanted
two
trials
or
he
just
say,
he
didn’t
want
both
trials
on
the
first
occasion?
unknown
speaker
so
you
do
not
contend
that
there
is
either
a
waiver
or
an
estoppel?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
established
legal
doctrine
that
you
say
applies?
this
is
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
call
that
doctrine?
unknown
speaker
no
time
did
he
say
he
wanted
two
trials.
unknown
speaker
matter
of
fact
he
said
he
did
not
want
any
trial.
he
pleaded
not
guilty.
unknown
speaker
i
would
say
you
can
punish
him
for
asking
for
two
trials,
he
is
saying
that
i
do
not
want
to
be
tried
on
both
of
these
at
the
same
time.
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
originally
said
that
you
are
going
to
go
for
two
trials
and
you
had
not
made
the
motion
to
consolidate,
would
not
he
be
in
the
same
position
he
is
in
now?
unknown
speaker
he
said
it
was
his
action
and
i
think
probably
it
was
your
action
because
you
made
the
motion
to
consolidate,
that
is
all
i
am
saying.
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
record
as
we
have
it
is,
one,
two
indictments,
two,
dates
for
trial
and
one
on
each
indictment,
three,
your
motion
to
consolidate
and
his
opposition
to
the
motion
to
consolidate.
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
not
his
violation,
it
was
yours,
you
made
the
motion.
unknown
speaker
what
was
a
practical
consequence
of
the
two
trials
rather
than
the
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
finders
did
more
about
your
argument
perhaps
i
could
articulate
the
question
better.
is
the
result
of
all
of
this
that
the
government
had
to
go
to
trial
first
on
a
lesser
offence
and
when
it
got
a
guilt
verdict
on
that
it
was
prevented
from
trying
for
the
greater
offence.
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
in
effect
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
was
he
in
fact
tried
for
the
lesser
offence
first?
unknown
speaker
in
which
the
defendant
content
is
the
lesser
offence?
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
had
the
government
had
its
druthers
and
known
of
these
contentions
of
the
time,
they
would
have
tried
in
for
both
offences
jointly
or
else
would
have
tried
them
for
the
greater
offence
first.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
speedy
trial
act
might
give
the
defendant
in
a
particular
situation
some
ammunition
to
force
the
district
judge
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
unless
indictments
were
different
dates,
if
there
was
a
substantial
lapse
of
time
between
the
two
indictments
it
certainly
would
enter
into.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheehan
who
made
the
decision
as
to
what
after
was
decided
in
the
two
cases
would
not
be
consolidated,
who
decided
which
should
go
first?
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
request
that
the
greater
offence
assuming
that
the
other
side’s
characterization
did
that
trial
go
forward
first?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
how
far
does
your
position
go
on
this
trying
the
lesser
and
then
later
you
are
free
to
try
the
greater,
supposing
you
have
is
in
your
bank
robbery
statute,
it
is
a
series
of
four
to
five
series
each
one
a
little
bit
larger
and
the
one
in
the
preceding
subparagraph.
would
you
say
the
constitution
would
not
present
any
obstacle
to
a
series
of
say
five
or
six
trials,
you
would
get
what
you
can
the
first
time
then
you
come
back
and
try
for
a
little
more
at
the
second
time.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
were
an
indictment
for
manslaughter
in
the
trial
and
the
conviction
of
manslaughter,
you
go
to
federal
or
state
government
then
indicting
for
first
degree
murder
for
exactly
the
same
killing
for
that,
but
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
think
if
he
has
been,
i
think
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
prohibit
the
trial
of
a
defendant
on
a
greater
offence
after
he
has
been
convicted
on
a
lesser
included
offence
provided
that
at
neither
trial
is
he
twice
in
jeopardy
for
either
or
the
other
offences.
unknown
speaker
the
whole
issue
is
whether
or
not
he
is
twice
in
jeopardy.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
question
begging
answer.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
i
say
trial
and
conviction
of
men
slaughter
and
then
a
subsequent
indictment
trial
and
trial
of
murder
for
the
same
killing
is
that
permissible
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right,
because
he
was
only
charged
with
men
slaughter.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
in
--
i
am
not
talking
about
somebody
who,
the
trial
of
assault
and
the
person
subsequently
dies.
i
am
talking
about
a
homicide.
unknown
speaker
then
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
you
have
said
you
get
credit
for
the
time
you
served
on
the
lesser
offence.
unknown
speaker
the
men’s
charged
with
men
slaughter,
and
give
him
to
five
year,
then
he
charged
with
second
degree
murder
for
the
same
killing
and
he
gets
15
years,
but
he
gets
to
five
taken
off
for
the
15,
right
and
then
he
is
sentenced
to
die,
what
credit
does
he
get
there?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
man
robbed
the
federal
bank
and
he
is
charged
with
received
stolen
goods
and
then
he
is
charged
with
robbery,
then
he
is
charged
with
robbery
with
force
and
then
he
is
convicted
of
robbery
with
deadly
weapon.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
think
that
is
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
defendant
is
first
indicted
for
robbing
a
bank,
which
had
federal
insurance
under
the
appropriate
federal
statute
that
bank
being
located
in
hammond,
indiana
and
then
charged
with
transportation
of
the
proceeds
of
a
bank
robbery
across
state
lines
assuming
there
was
a
federal
statute
prohibiting
that.
do
you
think
that
act
punishment
after
trial
and
conviction
on
both
of
those
charges
even
though
they
involved
precisely
the
same
acts
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
blockburger
because
by
its
terms
does
not
refer
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
unknown
speaker
intuitive
congress.
unknown
speaker
but
i
know
the
government
is
prohibited
by
order
of
court
from
tying
both
together,
it
was
not
prohibited
by
order
of
court
from
trying
the
greater
offence
first.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
it
was
aware
there
was
a
possibility,
it
might
be
so
considered.
unknown
speaker
it
is
that
different
understanding
of
the
law
on
the
basis
of
the
defendant’s
argument.
unknown
speaker
oh
but
you
knew
there
was
an
issue
with
that
all
i
am
saying,
at
least
you
should
have
known
there
was
an
issue,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
respect
the
rule
and
your
favor
and
how
did
that
they
were
separate
offences.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
your
claim
now
that
it
rule
that
one
was
not
a
lesser
included
offence,
in
that
respect
did
it
rule
favorably
to
you.
unknown
speaker
you
see
in
here
maybe
i
missed
it,
the
government
could
have
indicted
in
one
indictment
with
two
count.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
for
some
reason
that
you
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
know
they
decided
to
do
in
two
indictments.
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
had
put
it
in
two
there
is
no
way,
you
could
have
challenged
that
unknown
speaker
he
could
have.
unknown
speaker
so
we
would
come
out
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
that
follows,
because
is
not
one
of
the
reasons
for
his
position
that
there
should
be
separate
trials
in
fact
that
there
were
a
lot
of
defendants
in
the
conspiracy
trial
with
respect
to
whom
prejudicial
evidence
will
be
introduced
who
are
not
defendants
in
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
guide.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
call
it;
what
would
you
call
it
when
defendant
moves
for
a
mistrial
after
he
has
been
closed
to
jeopardy
and
this
trial
is
granted
and
then
he
has
tried
again,
you
would
call
it
waiver
or
stopple
or
---
unknown
speaker
you
think
each
of
these
indictments
required
exactly
the
same
proof
or
was
there
some
proof
required
for
each
that
was
not
required
in
the
other.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
the
issue
whether
it
was
identical,
what
is
the
government
required
to
prove
or
something
as
to
each
indictment
and
that
was
not
required
to
prove
the
other,
and
not
whether
they
did
in
fact.
unknown
speaker
was
not
it
almost
a
definition
of
a
lesser
included
offence
that
the
lesser
included
offence
involves
the
same
proof
as
a
greater
included
offence,
but
that
the
greater
involved
the
proof
of
the
lesser
included
offence
plus
x
plus
something
more.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
it
means.
unknown
speaker
by
man
slaughter
and
first
to
be
murdered.
unknown
speaker
if
the
government
had
followed
the
option
that
you
just
suggested
could
it
have
properly
requested
a
lesser
included
offence
instruction
in
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
but
blockburger
was
not
rested
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
unknown
speaker
then
why
do
you
site
blockburger
for
the
proposition
that
you
just
said?
unknown
speaker
are
those
decisions
binding
on
us?
