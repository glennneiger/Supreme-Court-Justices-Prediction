justice
harry
a.
blackmun
with
the
chief
justices'
permission,
i
think
i'll
take
up
the
other
case
first.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no.
75-1805,
jeffers
against
the
united
states
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
and
i
take
it
up
first
because
it
is
related
in
a
way
to
brown
against
ohio
which
mr.
justice
powell
has
just
announced.
this
case
too
raises
a
double
jeopardy
issue
in
the
context
of
a
trial
for
a
lesser
offense
followed
by
a
trial
for
a
greater
offense.
brown,
mr.
justice
powell
has
stated
was
concerned
with
driving
an
automobile
without
the
owner's
possession
or
permission
and
then
auto
theft.
the
jeffers
case
instead
concerns
a
charge
of
conspiring
to
distribute
heroine
and
coke,
cocaine
and
the
conduct
of
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise
to
violate
the
drug
laws
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
jeffers'
activity
centered
in
gary
indiana,
and
it
appears
to
be
accepted
as
a
fact
that
he
was
the
head
of
a
highly
sophisticated
narcotics
distribution
network
in
that
city
from
1972
to
1974.
a
federal
grand
jury
returned
two
indictments
against
him,
one
charging
him
and
nine
others
with
conspiracy,
and
the
second
charging
him
with
criminal
enterprise
endeavor.
the
united
states
moved
to
consolidate
the
two
indictments
for
trial.
this
motion,
however,
was
opposed
by
jeffers
and
his
co-defendants
under
the
conspiracy
charge.
their
opposition
was
on
the
ground
that
neither
the
parties
nor
the
charges
were
the
same
and
that
much
of
the
evidence
on
the
conspiracy
case
would
be
inadmissible
against
jeffers
on
the
second
charge.
the
government's
motion
was
denied.
jeffers
and
six
of
his
co-defendants
were
then
tried
and
found
guilty
of
conspiracy.
he
received
a
maximum
sentence
of
15
years
and
a
fine.
jeffers
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
other
indictment
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
claiming
that
conspiracy
was
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
continuing
criminal
enterprise
charge,
and
this
motion
was
denied.
the
second
trial
went
on
and
again,
he
was
found
guilty,
and
this
time,
he
also
received
a
maximum
sentence
namely
life
imprisonment
and
a
$100,000.00
fine.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
holding
that
a
case
here
two
years
ago
in
yanelli
against
the
united
states
created
a
new
double
jeopardy
rule
applicable
only
to
complex
statutory
crimes.
we
disagree
with
that
analysis
by
the
court
of
appeals
but
generally
affirm
the
judgement
except
as
to
the
duplication
of
punishment
and
thus,
the
judgement
is
affirmed
in
part
and
vacated
in
part
and
the
case
is
remanded.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
which
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
four
of
us
withhold
that
jeffers'
action
in
opposing
the
government's
motion
to
consolidate
the
two
indictments
for
trial
served
to
deprive
him
of
any
right
he
might
have
had
against
consecutive
trials.
we
regard
this
as
an
exception
to
the
rule
established
today
in
brown
against
ohio
which
has
just
been
announced.
jeffers
could
have
been
tried
in
one
proceeding
but
he
chose
not
to
be
so
tried,
and
thus,
he
was
responsible
for
the
separate
prosecutions.
we
also
hold,
however,
that
to
the
extent
there
were
cumulative
penalties
under
the
two
statutes.
jeffers
is
entitled
to
have
the
fine
imposed
at
the
second
trial
reduced
to
the
maximum
specified
in
the
major
statute.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
separate
opinion.
he
concludes
that
the
yanelli
case
controls
this
one
and
thus,
he
concurs
in
the
judgement
with
respect
to
the
jeffers'
conviction.
mr.
justice
stevens,
who
was
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgement
to
the
extent
that
it
vacates
the
cumulative
finds
but
otherwise
dissents.
