mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
courts
would
recognize
that,
your
honor
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
undue
hardship
provision
provides.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
may
have
trouble
but
if
that
union
gives
him
trouble,
he
can
take
them
to
court
because
we
think
they
cannot
prevent
him
from
following
the
law.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
mr.
justice
marshall…
mr.
nathan
lewin
an
agreement
is
part
of
the
reasonable
sir,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
agreed
with
that,
but
we
think
the
union
speaks
here
of
rights
as
if
the
rights
grow
out
to
the
union
and
the
employees
against
the
whole
world,
an
employer
could
not
sell
the
brooklyn
bridge
in
his
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
then
have
his
employees
or
his
union
say,
we
have
rights
to
the
brooklyn
bridge
because
you
have
put
it
into
the
agreement.
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that
is
exactly
it
and
they
do
not
own
hardison’s
right
to
an
accommodation
under
the
federal
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
are
not
suggesting
they
ignore
it
but
the
agreement
with
the
union…
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
say
the
union
agreement
cannot
overwrite
the
statute
because
whatever
the
employer
can
assign
away
and
that
is
all
that
the
union
agreement
is.
mr.
nathan
lewin
absolutely,
and
we
submit
that
in
the
union
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
said
the
employer
may
not
hire
female
employees
would
not
be
a
defense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
to
that
extent,
mr.
hardison’s
right
is
limited,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
is
conditional
and
it
depends
on
an
evaluation
of
very
circumstance
and
we
argue
in
our
brief,
i
think,
extensively
and
we
submit
on
that
brief
that
it
is
proper
for
congress
in
order
to
implement
the
free
exercise
clause
against
private
parties
to
enact
the
statute
such
as
this,
to
protect
religion.
