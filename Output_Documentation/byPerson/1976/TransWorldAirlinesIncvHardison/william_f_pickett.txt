mr.
william
f.
pickett
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
deny
a
request
for
a
four
day
week,
the
statute
does
not
address,
yes
they
can.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
the
record
is
absent
as
to
that
because
this
was
the
first
time,
this
had
ever
came
up
mr.
justice
marshall
in
twa’s
history
at
the
kansas
city.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
how
they
discriminated
against
mr.
hardison,
my
client?
mr.
william
f.
pickett
well,
they
discriminated
against
him
in
a
number
of
ways.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
let
him
work
his
job,
that
he
was
assigned
to
drive
a
train
and
pick
up
parts
and
take
back
used
parts,
as
long
as
it
would
not
cause
him
to
do
his
job
for
twa
and
violate
his
sabbath,
which
he
had
sincere
beliefs
that
he
could
not
violate.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
any
other
employee
this
was
the
first
one.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
well,
the
atheist
likewise
is
statute.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
no
your
honor,
sincerely
atheism
is
also
encompassed
i
believe
in
the
young
decision,
which
does
in
fact
cover
persons
who
in
fact
have
no
religion.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
it
is
a
neutral
application
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
he
does
not
want
something
anyone
else
has.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
if
they
sought…
mr.
william
f.
pickett
those
persons
who
are
members
of
the
seniority
provisions,
who
in
fact
been
through
saturday
off,
those
persons
that
amorphous
group
that
the
union
says
with…
mr.
william
f.
pickett
he
had
saturday
off
for…
mr.
william
f.
pickett
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
no
he
did
not
surrender
that.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
he
did
not
surrender
it,
he
in
fact
by
way
of
application
of
his
going
to
building
number
two
found
that
he
was
in
less
seniority,
yes.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
yes
by
all
means.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
if
you
want
to
use
surrender
yes,
but…
mr.
william
f.
pickett
alright.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
by
all
means
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
and
still
met
the
burden
imposed
on
yet
by
the
statute,
yes.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
the
union
was
agreeable
to
four
days
off.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
no,
never
did
they
say
that.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
they
had
no
objection
to
mr.
hardison
working
four
days
however,
twa
did
have
the
objection.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
in
his
question,
the
union
relief
committee
was
available
in
this
instance
at
the
same
day
that
this
case
was
tried
there
was
mr.
libby
whose
wife
was
off
because
she
was
ill.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
he
did
not
know
of
the
union
relief
committee,
the
record
reflects
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
yes
but
that
was,
that
is
not
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
what
did
twa
do?
mr.
william
f.
pickett
he
did
not
file
a
grievance
after
the
discharge
hearing
in
which
the
union
told
him,
all
we
can
do
is
plead
for
leniency,
mr.
chief
justice
he
did
not
file
a
grievance,
no.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
although
we
do
not
have
to
reach
in
this
case,
yes
i
would
as
franks
echoes
that
also
with
the
footnote.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
am
saying
yes
they
must
because
the
law
directs
that
the
employer
must
make
a
reasonable
accommodation.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
absolutely
not.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
no,
it
is
not
because
they
did
not
disagree
with
twa.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
yes
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
just
two
questions.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
supervisor
covering
calling,
can
somebody
stay
afterwards.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
cannot
say
for
sure.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
could
not
say
that
might
occur
because
in
your
hypothetical
situation
early
in
your
questions
to
mr.
feldmiller,
if
in
fact
they
would
have
posted
the
job
then
nobody
might
have
bid
on
it
and
in
fact
he
could
have
be
able
to
work
within
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
there
would
have
been
no
cost
to
anyone.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
that
is
correct
because
it
was
not
open,
i
also
remember
him
responding
to
you
in
that
regard.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
it
was
an
emergency.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
yes,
it
is
an
emergency
from
my
client
mr.
justice
marshall
by
all
means.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
pardon.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
he
never
had
been
compelled
to
work.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
no
that
he
did
--
well
he
knew
the
sabbath
is
coming.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
yes,
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
going
to
be
compelled
by
where
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provision.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
would
imagine
he
most
certainly
could
he
did
not
know
too
much
and
he
followed
the
unions,
lead
as
to
what
they
suggested
regarding
leniency.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
absolutely.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
mr.
kussman.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
twa.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
that
was
not
an
affirmative
enough
statement
writing
a
letter
in
my
judgment
and
judge
webster.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
understand,
of
any
substance
they
did
nothing.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
yes,
they
would.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
here
in
washington,
and
it
would
be
a
private
employer
with
a
requisite
number
of
employees,
they
would
be
violating,
now,
section
703(j),
i
believe,
the
reasonable
accommodation
provisions.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
it
would
have
to
determine
upon
the
facts
of
each
case,
what
is
reasonable.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
think
the
federal
law’s
congressional
dictate
supersedes
their
sole
need
if
that
is
it
because
the
second
step
of
course
one
that
district
court
looks
at
is
whether
or
not
there
is
an
undue
hardship,
and
one
does
not
get
to
a
hardship
being
undue,
or
less
than
that
until
something
besides
a
letter
requesting
a
meeting
is
in
fact
participated
in.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
again,
they
are
not
covered
by
the
statute,
and
secondly
the
sincerity...
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
respectfully
disagreed;
there
was
a
benefit.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
thought
you
are
referring
to
the
religion,
of
course,
i
am
getting
a
benefit.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
this
is
basically
a
society
in
which
we
observe
the
sabbath
on
sunday
and
it
is
a
neutral
policy
that
congress
chose
to
in
fact
effect…
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
would
concur
with
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
for
religious
purposes,
if
in
fact
the
congress
--
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
depending
on
the
circumstances…
mr.
william
f.
pickett
if
twa
had
only
three
people
who
in
fact
could
have
done
this
particular
job
and
in
fact
would
have
shown
that
it
would
hamper
them
tremendously,
in
that
particular
aspect
i
would
say
they
would
not
have
had
to
accommodate
him
because
it
would
have
been
an
undue
hardship
and
in
fact
they
would
not
have
violated
the
law.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
there
is
a
reasonableness
test
which
one
has
to
be
determined
by
the
district
court
and
i
think
franks
versus
bowman
that
goes
at.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
no.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
taking
your
hypothetical
aftereffects
of
this
case,
no
i
would
not,
because
the
law
addresses
itself
to
the
purpose
of
employment
security
purging
interstate
commerce
with
those
things
that
are
impermissible
in,
in
fact,
protecting
employment
security,
and
the
benefit,
if
any,
which
is
incidental
to
the
person,
is
to
the
person,
not
to
any
religious
groups
and
he
cannot
be
credited
with
what
his
church
may
or
may
not
say
over
the
radio.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
pardon.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i,
at
that
point,
would
say
the
district
court
under
the
rule
52
in
determining
the
credibility
and
the
sincerity
of
the
individual
would
be
able
to
determine
that
factor,
which
would
of
course
kick
off
any
reasonable
accommodation
if
a
person
just
joined
for
six
months.
mr.
william
f.
pickett
i
appreciate
the
court's
time.
