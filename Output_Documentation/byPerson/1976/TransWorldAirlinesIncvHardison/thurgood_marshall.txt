justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
it
was
volunteer
situation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
somebody
voluntarily
gave
up
or
was
persuaded
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
happen
if,
two
men
one
saturday,
one
on
sunday
and
they
agree
that
anytime
comes
up
we
will
switch.
justice
thurgood
marshall
put
in
another
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
did
they
discriminate
against
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
uh-huh.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
did
hardison
asked
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
else
has
that
right
at
twa
other
than
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
about
the
atheist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
he
could
take
off
any
day,
he
wanted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
--
thank
you,
you
are
on
the
point
of
preference,
you
want
some…
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
it
be
neutral
when
he
says
i
want
something
nobody
else
has,
how
is
that
neutral?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he
wants
saturday
off,
does
anybody
else
have
saturday
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
anybody
else
in
this
record
have
saturday
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
anybody
in
his
category?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
had
seniority
preference
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
surrendered
that
voluntarily.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
surrendered
seniority?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
he
know
it,
before
he
went
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
he
surrendered
it,
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
word
do
you
like,
i
will
use
whatever
word
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
have
ignored
the
agreement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
employer
could
have
ignored
the
agreement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
the
union
be
doing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
union
agreeable
to
waive
--
were
the
union…
listen
to
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
union
agreed
that
twa
could
ignore
its
bargaining
agreement,
and
you
know
that…?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
heard
what
u
say.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
is
that
the
sabbath
comes
up
every
week
and
an
emergency
does
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
the
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
was
not
his
first
sabbath.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
his
first
sabbath
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
sabbaths
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
knew
it
was
coming.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
know
the
sabbath
is
coming?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
lewin
we
do
recognize
that
with
the
bargaining
agreement
the
employer
is
not
free
to
follow
the
law
and
ignore
the
agreement,
is
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
what
the
law
says
that
whatever
you
can
do
without
interfering
with
agreements
and
other
things,
you
must
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
you
think
that
the
agreement
is
a
part
of
the
reasonable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought...
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
twa
does
not
own
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
twa
does
not
own
the
brooklyn
bridge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
also
have
an
agreement
with
the
union
and
they
cannot
ignore
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
the
union
agreement
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
excuses
me,
mr.
ratner,
before
you
sit
down,
i
have
assumed
twa
has
got
a
computer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
have
it
in
employment
office.
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
they
have
in
the
computer
the
number
of
men
who
would
prefer
to
work
on
sundays,
rather
than
saturday,
the
number
who
would
prefer
to
work
on
saturdays
rather
than
sunday?
so
all
you
have
to
do
would
be
push
a
button
and
you
will
find
that
number.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
know
anything
about
computer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
a
computer
could
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
when
they
make
up
their
job
schedules,
would
not
it
be
rather
easy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
the
computer
had
the
seniority
in
that?
