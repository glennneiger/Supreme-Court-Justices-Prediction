mr.
feldmiller,
before
he
leave
that
meeting,
was
their
discussion
of
that
meeting
of
the
possible
swap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
explain
to
me
why
the
swap
was
not
feasible
and
the
reason
i
asked
that
question
is
apparently
it
must
have
been
assumed
when
the
company
indicated
willingness
to
consider
giving
him
his
special
holidays
that
they
probably
betrayed
why
could
never
have
been
swapped
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
the
work
there
--
i
think
judge
webster
said
there
are
about
200
people
who
could
have
done
the
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
it
prohibit
swaps?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
but
why
could
not
--
supposing
he
had
said,
i
have
got
a
friend
that
will
fill
in
for
me
and
then
the
answer
would
be
well,
he
cannot
unless
he
open
the
job
for
bidding,
why
could
not
that
have
been
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
in
the
company?
say,
somebody
comes
and
say,
we
got
to
go
to
the
dentist
next
friday,
can
i
trade
with
somebody,
is
there
anyway
to
handle
problem
like
that
people
just
never
switched
at
twa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
forecloses
the
swap?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
all
that
means
is,
to
find
a
candidate
for
a
swap,
before
it
can
be
effectuated,
you
have
got
to
say,
is
anybody
with
more
seniority
want
to
do
it.
why
does
that
prohibit
trying
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
it
have
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
stipulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
everything
that
the
parties
thought
the
court
needed
to
pass
on
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
nobody
had
filed
them
up
to
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
ratner
did
not
that
testimony
related
to
more
or
less
permanent
to
exchange
of
jobs
as
oppose
to
i
cannot
work
this
friday
as
there
is
somebody
i
can
trade
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
record
tell
us
how
they
are
going
to
solve
the
holiday
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
follow
up
with
one
other
question,
if
someone
senior
objected
to
that
then
it
would
be
to
swap
with
somebody
else
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
says,
well
i
get
the
toothache
and
has
to
got
to
the
dentist
it
is
got
to
be
an
emergency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
his
counsin
comes
in
from
out
of
town
that
is
once
in
a
long
time,
it
has
to
see
in
that
one
day
and
trade
with
somebody,
you
just
cannot
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
he
ask
the
union
relief
committee
to
do
anything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
pickett,
let
me
just
ask
one
more
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
the
company
or
the
union
or
both
could
have
accommodated
your
client
without
imposing
any
addition
cost
on
the
company
and
without
violating
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
or
was
one
of
those
two
things
essentially?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
you
mean
overtime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
essential
that
there
be
cost
assumed
such
as
overtime
supervisory
covering,
or
one
day
the
job
not
met
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
in
principles
it
is
quite
a
different
case
if
you
assume
that
and
if
you
assume
the
cost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
their
answer
to
that
as
i
understand
is
he
did
not
request
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
on
the
basis
of
what
he
did
is
it
correct
that
there
was
not
way
to
oblige
him
without
either
the
company
assuming
some
abnormal
cost
or
violating
the
agreement,
one
of
those
two?
