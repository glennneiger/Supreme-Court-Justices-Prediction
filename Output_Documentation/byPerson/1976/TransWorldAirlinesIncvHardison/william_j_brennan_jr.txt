brennan,
jr.
mr.
feldmiller
getting
back
again
to
the
factual
framework
of
this
case.
you
told
us
that
this
place
of
employment
operates
365
days
a
year
that
of
course
include
sundays.
as
we
both
know
most
people
observe
the
sabbath
on
sunday.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
provision
has
the
company
and
or
the
union
made,
if
any,
to
accommodate
the
religious
views
of
those
who
observed
the
sabbath
on
sunday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
record
show
anything
on
this
subject?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
accommodation
of
those
employees
who
observe
the
sabbath
on
sunday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
record
just
contains
nothing
on
this.
