mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
stevens’
question
concerning
why
the
least
jobs
could
not
have
been
put
up
for
bid.
they
could
not
have
been
put
up
for
bid
because
neither
party
to
the
potential
swap
asked
his
job
be
put
up
for
bid,
neither
was
willing
to
vacate
his
job.
hardison
testify
at
pages
83
and
84
of
the
appendix
that
he
knew
all
about
the
procedure,
it
was
probably
possible
for
him
to
get
into
that
midnight
shift
where
he
would
not
have
to
work
on
his
sabbath
by
bidding.
but
that
job
was
not
open
because
the
fellow
on
the
midnight
shift
had
not
indicated
any
willingness
whatever
to
leave
it,
in
fact,
hardison
said
he
had
no
idea
whether
the
fellow
be
even
willing
to
swap.
there
had
been
no
application
by
that
man
to
leave
his
job,
nor
had
there
been
one
by
hardison
and
that
is
what
triggers
the
bidding
is
the
job
vacancy,
the
record
is
clear
that
there
was
no
job
vacancy;
one
could
have
been
created,
had
either
one
of
these
two
employees
chosen
to
create
one
by
telling
the
company
they
want
to
leave
it,
neither
have
not
been.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
difference
is
between,(a)
i
cannot
work
this
friday
which
is
treated
as
an
emergency
situation
and
which
sometimes
has
worked
out
and
the
recurrent
or
permanent
situation
which
is
clear
must
be
handled
by
the
bidding
procedure.
there
is
testimony
that
occasionally
through
the
union
relief
committee
things
were
worked
out
but
there
is
no
testimony
that
at
any
of
those
situations,
the
seniority
rights
of
any
intervening
employee
would
have
impaired.
in
short,
even
a
swap,
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
could
not
have
been
accomplished
if
that
swap
had
been
over
the
objection
of
some
other
employee
would
have
preferred
to
work
that
shift.
now,
here
you
had
as
many
as
200
potential
applicants
for
this
job
and
it
was
obviously
impossible
for
a
continued
period,
here
it
was
a
minimal
of
three
weeks
and
basically
it
was
far
more
than
that
because
hardison
was
a
permanent
congruent
presumably
to
this
religion,
he
would
constantly
in
any
job
that
he
had
where
he
remained
a
senior
man,
come
into
the
situations
where
he
would
be
unwilling
to
perform
to
meet
the
job
requirements
of
that
job,
which
was
attendance
of
work
on
the
scheduled
work
day.
the
company
treated
it
until
as
far
as
the
record
shows
non-discriminatorily
treat,
as
completely
different
situation
on
one
day
swap,
the
holidays,
they
were
willing
to
do,
they
did.
nobody’s
seniority
rights
were
impaired.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
record
does
not
tell
us
how
they
were
going
to
solve
the
problem
except
that
they
did
solve
the
holiday
problem
well,
in
a
sense
it
tells
us.
it
tells
us
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
be
available
to
work
on
the
christian
holidays.
he
might
or
might
not
have
had
a
chance
to
do
or
been
obliged
to
come
in
and
work
those
holidays
depending
on
whether
the
people
senior
to
him
in
seniority
wanted
the
chance
to
work
those
holidays.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
am
sorry.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
they
were
persuaded
or
induced
by
extra
payments
to
come
in
and
work
on
a
holiday,
he
would
have
gotten
extra
pay
for
working
on
a
holiday.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no
that
cannot
be
done,
you
are
violating
the
seniority
rights
of
all
the
people
with
seniority
over
both
of
the
swap.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no
it
would
not
be.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no
the
fellow
who
has
got
toothache
and
has
to
go
to
the
dentist
is
probably
going
to
get
sick
leave.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor
the
one
day
temporary
situation
is
handled
intelligently,
sensibly,
regularly
in
this
planet
was
handled
for
hardison.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
a
three
week
period
of
time
is
more
than
the
company
properly
felt
could
be
treated
as
an
emergency
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
they
were
right.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
what
do
you
mean
requires,
obliteration
of
rights
under
a
collective
bargaining.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
right.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
is
a
total
and
definitive
answer
in
this
context
only
to
the
questions
that
i
understood
mr.
justice
stevens
to
be
asking,
which
was,
was
there
a
way
to
accommodate
this
man
by
swapping
shifts
which
would
not
have
violated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
which
my
answer
is
no.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
say
that
your
honor,
yes
that
is
why
our
position,
i
say
that
if
we
come
to
that,
if
the
court
has
to
come
to
that,
i
see
no
escape
from
holding
that
such
a
statute
violates
the
establishments
clause.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes
your
honor,
that
is
what
i
am
telling.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
is
standards
that
of
someone
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
the
union
is
there
to
see
to
it
that
the
seniority
rights
of
nobody
in
the
plant
are
taken
away
from
them
whether
they
complaint
about
it
or
not,
they
are
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
exercise
their
rights
under
that
agreement,
if
that
union
does
not
do
that,
it
is
not
performing
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
it
is
possible
to
read
the
statute,
this
statute
that
is
conflicting
with
the
whole
rest
of
title
vii
as
compelling
discrimination
on
the
face
of
retention
of
703(j)
which
says
you
shall
not
prefer
any
employees
because
of
their
among
other
things
religion,
you
shall
not
give
them
a
preference,
of
course
congress
could
have
left
that,
it
could
have
left
703
unchanged,
it
could
have
left
as
it
did
701(a)
unchanged
with
thoughts
only
about
discrimination.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
in
view
of
the
shortness
of
time
remaining,
i
am
going
to
have
to
rely
principally
on
my
reply
brief,
which
does
to
suppose
i
think
of
most
the
contention
that
your
honors
have
heard,
but
i
want
to
make
several
points.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes
sir.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
i
am
sure
it
has.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
answer
to
that
is
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
do
not
know
anything
about
whether
they
could
that;
i
do
know
that
they
probably
have
not
asked
anybody
about
what
their
preferences
are.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
a
computer
could
do
it,
presumably.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
it
would
be
impossible
without
violating
seniority.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
if
they
ran
the
posting
system,
the
job
bidding
system
by
computer,
they
would
run
it
by
computer,
it
might
be
another
way
out
of
it,
but
it
does
not
change
the
legal
problem
i
think
it
changed
the
practice
problem.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
with
two
exceptions,
the
company
could
have
held
employees
overtime
paid
them
overtime
that
would
not
have
bothered
this.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
it
would
have
destroyed
the
company,
i
mean
it
would
have
been
a
substantial
burden
on
them.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
sure.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
it
would
have
required
them
to
make
some
kind
of
arrangement
about
paying
somebody
else
to
cover
for
them
possibly,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
time
and
half,
yeah.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
i
am
saying
that
those
are
two
what
are
called
accommodations,
but
as
far
as
i
know
could
have
been
made
without
violating
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
those
involved
the
tax
on
the
company
and
it
is
my
submission
that
is
just…
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yeah,
that
is
right
and
that
is
what
really
worries
me,
that
is
why
i
am
here
of
course
that
is
why
i
am
here.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
prefer
not
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well
i
think
that
any
indication
that
he
would
like
to
be
accommodated
that
he
would
like
to
have
something
done
so
that
we
would
not
have
to
work
on
the
sabbath
is
enough
to
trigger
a
constitutionally
construed
obligation
under
this
statute
for
a
company
to
see
if
something
can
be
done
reasonably
to
accommodate
you.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
last
point
i
made
was
that
it
would
depend
in
part
on
the
intensity
of
the
belief
and
the
nature
of
the
practice
and
how
important
it
is
in
the
hierarchy
of
that
religion
and
how
important
in
the
hierarchy
of
that
individual’s
observance
of
it,
and
i
suggested
your
honor
that
is
a
very
reason
why
the
statute
can
not
conceivably
stand
because
that
is
the
worst
entanglement
that
ever
was
with
religion.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
i
appreciate
you
are
getting
me
off
the
spot.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
thank
you.
