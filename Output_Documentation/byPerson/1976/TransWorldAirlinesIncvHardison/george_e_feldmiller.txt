mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit,
involves
two
general
issues:
first,
the
extent
of
the
protection
under
the
establishment
clause
and
so
far
as
whether
a
person
can
in
effect
to
be
taxed
or
forced
to
expand
money
or
to
be
deprived
of
work
coverage
or
non-discriminatory
work
rules
so
that
another
may
practice
his
religion.
second,
the
proper
application
of
two
provisions
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act
in
the
context
of
rule
52(a)’s
fairly
erroneous
requirement.
the
first
provision
under
the
civil
rights
act
is
the
1972
congressional
amendment,
section
701(j)
and
its
forerunner
the
1967
eeoc
guideline
both
of
which
define
religion
and
require
an
employer
to
reasonably
accommodate
all
aspects
of
his
employee’s
religious
observance
and
practice,
as
well
as
beliefs
and
i
emphasize
all
beliefs,
unless
that
employer
can
demonstrate
an
undue
hardship.
the
second
provision
of
the
1964
civil
rights
act,
the
section
703(h)
and
that
declares
that
it
shall
not
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
for
an
employer
to
apply
different
terms
of
employment
pursuant
to
a
bona
fide
seniority
or
merit
system
provided
that
such
differences
are
not
the
result
of
an
intention
to
discriminate
and
incidentally
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
any
intention
to
discriminate.
after
a
full
blown
evidentiary
hearing
in
which
seven
witnesses
testified,
the
district
court
dismissed
mr.
hardison’s
religious
discrimination
claim
and
entered
its
findings
of
fact
that
twa
had
reasonably
accommodated
hardison
and
that
any
further
accommodation
would
have
constituted
an
undue
hardship.
judge
oliver
found
that
many
of
the
stipulated
facts
were
irrelevant
and
he
referenced
all
of
his
findings
to
the
transcript
testimony
of
the
live
witnesses
and
he
stated
that
he
was
impressed
with
the
men,
who
are
on
the
line
handling
the
problem.
the
eighth
circuit
disagreed
and
decreed
that
judge
oliver’s
findings
and
facts
were
clearly
erroneous.
now,
the
basic
facts
of
this
matter
can
be
succinctly
and
summarily
stated.
hardison
was
employed
at
twa’s
major
overhaul
base
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
that
base
operates
24
hours
a
day,
365
days
a
year.
at
the
time
he
was
employed
in
1967,
hardison
indicated
that
he
would
work
shifts
including
weekends.
upon
his
employment,
he
became
a
union
member
and
he
functioned
in
accordance
with
the
bona
fide
seniority
rights
that
governed
all
job
assignments
under
the
applicable
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
thereafter
in
the
spring
of
1968,
hardison
began
studying
the
religion
known
as
the
worldwide
church
of
god.
in
april,
he
wrote
his
supervisor,
mr.
everett
kussman,
and
he
stated
that
he
wanted
special
time
off
from
friday
sunset
to
saturday
sunset
because
he
sincerely
believed
that
that
was
the
sabbath
under
his
new
religion.
mr.
kussman
immediately
initiated
a
meeting
with
mr.
hardison
to
talk
about
this
matter.
kussman
agreed
to
excuse
time
off
for
seven
religious
holidays,
which
mr.
hardison
had,
none
of
which
were
the
same
as
the
contractual
holidays
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
kussman
also
agreed
to
the
union
seeking
swaps
or
days
off
and
in
an
attempt
to
find
another
job.
the
report
was
made
to
mr.
kussman
that
mr.
hardison’s
day-off
requirements
were
too
difficult
to
handle.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
yes,
with
the
same
employer.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
hardison
was
generally
able
to
avoid
saturday
work
from
april,
the
time
he
first
met
with
mr.
kussman,
through
march,
1969
or
up
to
march,
1969.
he
did
in
that
interim
worked
some
voluntary
overtime
work
on
his
sabbath.
now,
after
a
second
meeting
in
september,
1968
between
hardison,
kussman
and
the
union
steward,
hardison
was
still
able
to
avoid
the
saturday
work
and
he
was
fully
accommodated
in
his
religious
practices
because
mr.
kussman
had
been
able
to
agree
with
the
union
consent
that
he
could
have
his
seven
special
holidays
off.
however,
in
december
of
1968,
hardison
voluntarily
transferred
to
a
different
shift
in
a
different
building,
which
was
governed
by
different
seniority
requirements
and
seniority
list.
at
that
time
he
left
to
security
of
being
half
way
up
the
ladder
in
seniority
to
position
where
he
was
second
from
the
bottom.
when
he
made
this
transfer,
he
knew
that
he
could
expect
some
work
on
a
saturday
in
the
event
of
a
vacation
problem
or
the
employee
junior
to
him
might
be
ill
or
something
of
that
nature.
at
the
time,
well
he
had
no
saturday
work
up
to
march,
1969.
at
that
time
mr.
kussman,
the
twa
supervisor,
noticed
a
schedule
change
have
been
made
which
would
require
hardison
to
work
starting
saturdays
on
march
8th.
mr.
kussman
therefore
initiated
a
meeting
with
mr.
hardison;
and
brought
in
the
union
steward,
mr.
tinder,
to
see
what
roles
or
aspects
of
accommodation
could
be
made.
mr.
kussman
once
again
agreed
to
waive
the
seniority
obligations
upon
twa
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
the
union
steward
did
not
believe
that
that
could
be
done
and
refused
to
do
so.
mr.
hardison
offered
to
work
six
days
a
week
and
that
was
acceptable
to
twa
but
it
was
unacceptable
to
the
union
because
of
the
40-hour
work
rule
that
any
work
over
40
hours
was
subject
to
the
overtime
bidding
rights
of
all
other
employees.
the
aspect
of
whether
or
not
hardison
may
have
been
able
to
work
four
days
a
week,
may
well
have
been
discussed
at
this
meeting.
mr.
kussman
did
not
believe
that
he
could
allow
mr.
hardison
to
have
a
four
day
work
week.
because
he
needed
people
to
work
in
twa’s
continuous
operation
requirements,
he
was
the
only
person
scheduled
to
work
on
the
job
on
saturdays
after
march
8th.
this
was
a
job
that
had
to
be
filled
in
order
to
respond
to
any
emergencies
which
might
occur
at
the
overhaul
base.
mr.
hardison
was
not
satisfied
with
the
results
of
the
march
8,
1969
meeting
but
he
did
not
file
a
grievance
although
he
knew
he
could
do
so.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
yes,
there
was
a
discussion
of
general
swaps;
the
change
of
jobs,
perhaps
in
going
back
to
his
earlier
section.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
well,
the
basic
difference
between
the
holiday
situation,
the
seven
holiday
situations
and
the
swap
on
the
saturday
is
governed
by
the
realities,
i
think,
of
the
situation.
for
example,
twa
had
a
contractual
obligation
that
it
would
work
a
minimal
overtime
or
a
minimal
weekend
force
at
its
overhaul
base
on
the
weekends.
also,
the
people
with
the
high
seniority
just
preferred
not
to
work
on
saturdays.
so
we
had
a
very
limited
number
of
people
that
were
realistically
available
for
twa
at
this
time.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
there
may
have
been
more
than
200
people
who
could
have
done
the
work
but
none
of
those
people
were
available
within
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
did
not
provide
for
just
mere
a
swaps
between
employees.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
yes
sir,
every
time
mr.
justice
stevens,
there
is
an
opening
in
the
job
that
opening
had
to
be
subjected
to
the
bidding
rights
of
all
other
employees.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
twa
was
willing
to
do
that
and
the
union
was
willing
to
do
that
but
apparently
the
union
did
not
believe
that
the
bidding
would
have
been
available
or
would
have
rendered
hardison
any
relief.
there
were
no
jobs
available
within
the
seniority
framework
at
that
time.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
seniority
in
this
situation,
this
distinguishes
the
case
for
many
of
the
other
cases
that
have
been
decided,
under
the
terms
of
this
seniority
agreement….
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
that
would
be
the
provision
that
all
jobs,
all
shift
assignments
are
governed
by
the
seniority
rights
of
all
employees
that
would
appear…
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
well,
i
do
not
think,
i
do
not
think
that
that
was
not
tried
in
the
sense
that
twa
authorize
that
to
be
done;
it
is
the
union
steward
that
does
this.
the
union
steward
maintains
the
seniority
list
and
he
is
the
one
that
goes
through
the
list,
makes
the
context
to
fill
the
jobs.
our
hands
were
really
tied
in
going
out
to
the
employees;
if
we
did,
we
would
be
subject
to
the
union
understandably
saying
that
perhaps
you
are
out
there
trying
to
coerce
volunteers,
when
in
fact
we
would
not
be
doing
that.
it
could
lead
to
very
substantial
problems
with
the
union
relationship.
we
were
very
willing
for
that
to
be
done.
we
agreed
that
it
could
be
done
and
the
union
did
not
believe
that
it
was
proper
in
this
case
to
do.
i
do
not
know
their
exact
reasons.
mr.
ratner
might
be
able
to
explicate
further
on
those.
at
any
event
when
judge
oliver
saw
the
witnesses
and
when
he
rendered
his
decision,
he
took
into
account
the
fact
that
twa
had
to
consider
the
rights
of
other
employees.
the
problems
of
employee
morale
and
grievance
problems
and
problems
in
the
event
that
twa
went
further
without
union
consent,
he
also
took
into
account
that
all
religious
beliefs
it
would
be
burdensome
upon
the
employer
to
have
to
take
into
account
all
religious
beliefs
of
all
employees.
he
thought
that
seniority
was
an
important
right
and
that
under
section
703(h)
if
that
was
not
controlling
that
at
least
indicated
the
congressional
intent
to
protect
bona
fide
seniority
rights
and
in
fact
judge
oliver
found
that
it
was
coincidental
that
the
seniority
provision
in
this
case
acted
to
in
anyway
hamper
mr.
hardison’s
ability
to
work.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
yes
sir.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
the
people
who
had
observed
the
sabbath
on
sunday,
mr.
justice
brennan,
would
have
been
treated
exactly
like
mr.
hardison
was.
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
i
think
in
our
society
that
if
the
people
who
do
worship
on
sunday
wanted
off,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
company
like
twa
that
has
to
operate
24
hours
a
day
to
serve
the
public
and
fulfill
its
functions
to
continue
to
operate.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
no,
it
does
not
except...
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
except
the
fact
that
they
would
have
been
treated
exactly
the
same.
that
is
not
in
the
record,
but
they
would
have
been
treated
exactly
the
same
as
mr.
hardison.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
no.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
violated
rule
52(a)
and
try
the
matter
de
novo
and
we
think
that
this
is
an
important
consideration
in
this
case
because
the
court
of
appeals
really
misconstrued
the
record
we
believe
and
assuming
and
relegating
twa
the
role
of
a
paunches
pilot.
we
think
that
the
record
is
clear
that
mr.
kussman
did
his
very
best
as
an
individual
and
as
a
person
not
just
because
it
was
mandated
by
law
but
he
did
his
best
to
go
in
there
and
work
it
out
with
mr.
hardison,
at
the
same
time
protect
his
relationship
with
the
union
that
he
has
to
work
with
on
a
day
in,
day
out
basis.
we
also
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
some
serious
factual
mistakes
for
one
thing
it
said
it
reviewed
the
full
record.
in
fact,
it
did
not
do
that
because
the
full
record
was
no
filed
at
the
court
of
appeals.
the
full
record
now
is
on
file
at
this
court.
the
only
record
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
was
the
trial
appendix
and
while
that
is
a
full
appendix
and
relatively
full,
they
still
did
not
have
the
entire
record
to
review
in
purporting
to
reverse
judge
oliver’s
findings
as
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
yes,
did
not
have
all
of
the
evidence;
it
had
all
of
the
stipulations
many
of
which
judge
oliver
found
to
be
irrelevant
and
it
had
a
great
deal
of
the
testimony.
it
was
a
very
thorough…
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
there
were
some
things
according
to
the
federal
rules
that
were
not
placed
in
the
record
that
were
important
but...
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
they
did
not
call
upon
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
parties,
called
upon
the
district
court
to
apparently
send
off
the
rest
of
the
record.
we
were
under
the
impression
that
the
entire
record
were
submitted
and
we
are
so
informed
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
clerk,
but
when
i
got
the
record
for
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
called
me
and
said,
we
are
sorry
mr.
feldmiller,
we
made
an
earlier
mistake
and
we
did
not
have
the
entire
record.
mr.
george
e.
feldmiller
thank
you.
mr.
ratner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
