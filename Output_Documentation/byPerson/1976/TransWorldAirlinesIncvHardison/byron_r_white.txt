act

1964
involves
a
claim
by

employer,
trans
world
airlines,
did
not
make
the
efforts
required
by
the
statute
to
accommodate
his
religious
beliefs
and
practices,
so
that
he
cannot
only
work
for
twa
but
also
observe

sabbath.
the

held
that
twa
had
satisfied
the
statute.
the

the
eighth
circuit
held
otherwise
and
rule
that
twa
could
have
but
did
not
make
further
efforts
to
accommodate
hardison,
and
we
granted
certiorari.
and
we
now
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.

for
doing
so
are
stated
