unknown
speaker
to
find
another
job
with
the
same
employer?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
he
would
not
comply
with
the
rules.
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
think
mr.
ratner
that
the
statute
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
here,
permits
no
adjustment
whatever
of
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
but
your
response
to
the
questions
by
justice
stevens,
justice
marshall
has
been
primarily,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
were
just
now
way
to
do
this
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
as
if
that
were
a
total
and
definitive
answer
in
this
context.
unknown
speaker
you
say
then
the
congress
could
not
by
law
provide
that
and
an
a
employer
had
to
adjust
for
a
person
who
was
a
member
of
a
religion
which
prevented
him
from
working
on
saturday,
but
unless
it
also
require
such
adjustment
for
someone
whose
son
was
playing
football
or
basketball
and
could
not
work
on
saturday
for
the
same
day.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
finish
the
thought
and
then
i
will
leave
the
point.
unknown
speaker
well
it
cannot
be
done
if
it
conflicts
with
the
seniority
rights
of
someone.
unknown
speaker
if
someone
who
complaints
about
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
like
robinson-patman
act
conflicts
with
the
sherman
act,
we
have
that
both
in
the
antitrust
section
of
the
code,
they
both
been
enacted
by
congress
even
if
they
do
conflict.
unknown
speaker
would
you
suggest
that
if
all
an
employer
could
do
to
make
an
accommodation
would
be
to
breach
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
what
do
you
think
the
statute
would
require
that
and
would
take
precedence
over
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
employer
goes
to
the
union
to
workout
in
accommodation,
the
union
says
no
that
collective
bargaining
contract
requires
something
else.
unknown
speaker
now
you
do
not
think
that
was
the
case
here?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
union’s
position
is
that
it
is
the
case
here?
unknown
speaker
yes
he
had
mr.
justice
marshall.
unknown
speaker
could
he
have
challenged
these,
raised
these
problems
in
the
grievance
procedure
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
unknown
speaker
but
he
did
have
at
oral
even
seven
witnesses
orally.
unknown
speaker
you
did
say
twa
did
nothing,
who
was
the
man
that
wrote
the
letter
and
said,
you
come
in
and
let
us
talk
this
over?
unknown
speaker
he
works
for
whom?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
think
more
accurate
to
say
twa
did
not
do
enough
than
to
say
the
twa
did
nothing.
unknown
speaker
if
a
supermarket
chain
had
a
fixed
policy
of
not
hiring
any
sabbatarians
in
a
supermarket,
would
they
be
violating
some
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
well
let
us
take
it
one
more
step
then.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
they
try
to
have
some
adjustment
from
their
own
point
of
view
to
the
necessities
of
running
a
supermarket
store
on
saturday,
on
sunday,
which
they
all
do
now
i
understand
because
they
all
operate
on
saturday
and
sunday,
the
two
busiest
days
of
the
week.
unknown
speaker
the
purpose
of
the
supermarket
is
perfectly
obvious
that
they
want
to
have
enough
clerks
on
saturday
and
sunday,
who
take
care
of
the
overwhelming
number
of
shoppers,
who
do
their
shopping
on
saturday
and
sunday.
unknown
speaker
one
thing
we
think,
what
is
your
attitude,
what
is
the
employer
suppose
to
say
to
the
--
say
ten
people
come
in
and
say
we
do
not
want
to
work
on
saturday,
we
want
to
go
to
the
football
game
and
watch
our
children
play,
but
we
will
work
on
sunday
and
you
let
these
religious
practitioners
off
on
saturday,
now
let
us
off,
what
does
he
suppose
to
say
them?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
realize
that.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
it
is
a
benefit
if
they
can
get
off
on
saturday
and
see
their
children
play?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
not
that
a
benefit
there
i
mean
they
are
getting
off
on
saturday
to
practice
their
religion.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
there
are
some
people
that
the
employer
is
require
to
laid
off
on
saturday
and
other
people
that
he
is
not
required
to
laid
off
on
saturday.
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
not
any
circumstances
as
i
understand
your
position,
no
circumstances
at
all.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
it
costs
them
a
little
bit,
it
is
all
right,
but
if
it
costs
them
a
lot,
it
is
not
all
right.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
district
court
review
and
eeoc
review
and
court
of
appeals'
review
and
review
by
this
court
in
this
government
entanglement
with
religion
in
the
sense
that
it
was
used
in
law.
unknown
speaker
hypothetical,
let
us
assume
that
the
worldwide
church
of
god
--
and
this
is
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
church
membership,
where
i
substantially
augmented
by
the
popular
appeal
that
its
members
would
not
have
to
work
on
saturdays.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
even
if
membership
say
it
would
increase
by
significant
numbers,
a
million
people
who
have
responded
to
an
intensive
radio
campaign,
join
our
church,
you
will
not
have
to
work
on
saturday?
unknown
speaker
but
your
friend,
well
he
said
that
that
violate
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
for
the
shop
agreement
it
would
no
defense
in
right
to
work
stick
on
a
complaint
by
someone
who
choose
to
join
the
union,
even
though
the
whole
shop
agreement
if
it
is
signed
by
both
union
and
employee.
unknown
speaker
to
a
degree
they
are
contracted
away
by
the
very
clause
in
the
statute
relating
to
business
necessity
and
reasonableness,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
therefore,
it
follows
that
the
free
exercise
clause
in
your
position
is
not
an
absolute
guarantee;
it
is
a
conditional
guarantee.
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
they
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
ratner
i
ask
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
whether
the
collective
bargaining
contract
was
implicated
here
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what,
the
four
day
week
thing?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
double
time,
time
and
a
half?
unknown
speaker
but
otherwise
except
for
those
two
things
you
say
the…
unknown
speaker
the
position
on
the
other
side
must
worry
you
sufficiently
that
here
you
are,
i
mean
is
there
position
broader
than
that,
i
guess
their
position
is
that
even
if
it
did
trample
on
the
collective
bargaining
contract
that
is
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
mr.
ratner,
i
asked
this
only
because
of
something
in
your
brief,
do
you
think
that
this
court
in
general
electric
against
gilbert
cut
back
a
bit
on
duke
power
against
griggs?
page
17
unknown
speaker
mr.
ratner
let
me
ask
you
one
question
if
i
may?
unknown
speaker
would
the
reasonableness
of
the
company’s
reaction
depend
in
part
on
the
intensity
of
the
belief?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
because
he
agreed
to
the
cutting
back
provision.
