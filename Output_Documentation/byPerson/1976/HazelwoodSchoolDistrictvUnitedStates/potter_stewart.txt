justice
potter
stewart
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
litigation
began
in
1973
when
the
united
states
filed
suit
charging
the
hazelwood
school
district
in
suburban
st.
louis
county,
missouri
with
having
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
employment
of
its
teachers
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
amended.
the
district
court
found
that
hazelwood
had
not
engaged
in
such
discrimination.
an
important
part
of
the
district
court's
reasoning
was
based
on
its
view
that
the
small
number
of
negroes
employed
by
hazelwood
as
teachers
was
of
no
value
in
proving
that
hazelwood
had
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race
because
the
percentage
of
negro
pupils
in
the
school
district
was
equally
small.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
and
found
that
hazelwood
had
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
racial
discrimination.
this
finding
was
largely
based
on
statistical
evidence
introduced
by
the
government
showing
a
comparison
of
the
percentage
of
negroes
on
hazelwood's
teaching
staff
with
the
percentage
of
teachers
in
the
area
who
were
negroes
rather
than
with
the
percentage
of
negro
pupils
in
the
hazelwood
district.
the
relatively
small
percentage
of
negro
teachers
employed
by
hazelwood
when
coupled
with
the
government's
other
proof
led
the
court
of
appeals
to
direct
a
final
judgment
against
hazelwood.
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
district
court's
comparison
of
the
percentage
of
negro
teachers
to
the
percentage
of
negro
pupils
in
hazelwood
was
inappropriate
one.
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
in
undertaking
to
make
the
proper
statistical
comparisons
itself
instead
of
leaving
them
in
the
first
instance
for
evaluation
by
the
district
court.
statistical
comparisons
are
an
important
source
of
proof
in
title
vii
cases
but
statistical
data
ordinarily
require
careful
analysis
and
refinement
and
their
value
as
evidence
in
an
employment
discrimination
case
depends
upon
all
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
opinion
for
the
court
outlines
in
greater
detail
some
of
the
questions
arising
from
the
court
of
appeals
statistical
analysis.
questions
at
the
district
court
would
have
to
deal
with
on
remand.
only
after
those
questions
are
resolved,
will
there
be
an
adequate
foundation
for
determining
whether
the
hazelwood
school
district
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
racial
discrimination
in
employment
after
the
effective
date
of
the
federal
law
in
1972.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
have
each
filed
concurring
opinions
and
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
