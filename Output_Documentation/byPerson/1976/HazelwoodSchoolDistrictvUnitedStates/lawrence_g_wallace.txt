mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
find
ourselves
in
a
peculiar
position
here
of
not
believing
that
either
of
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
this
court
granted
is
really
presented
by
this
case,
unless
it
can
be
said
that
the
second
question
is
presented
in
a
very
limited
sense.
we
went
into
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
introduced
evidence
to
establish
a
four-pronged
showing
of
a
prima
facie
case
that
employment
discrimination
by
the
hazelwood
school
district
and
that
four-pronged
showing
as
we
presented
our
case,
is
very
well
summarized
by
mr.
justice
clark’s
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
statement
is
a
little
elliptical.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
elliptical
in
saying
in
violation
of
the
act
attached
to
that
whole
period
of
time.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
school
district
was
under
an
obligation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
not
to
discriminate
in
its
hiring
practices
during
that
entire
period
of
time
and
the
evidence
show
that
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
during
that
period,
the
portion
of
which
from
march
24th
1972
was
covered
by
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
this
kind
of
case,
probably
no
different
standard
substantively.
i
don’t
think
this
case
involves
any
substantive
extension
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
obligation.
i
think
that
the
impact
of
title
vii
in
this
case
is
a
procedural
impact
in
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
defendant
after
a
prima
facie
showing
of
discrimination
has
been
made,
of
purposeful
discrimination
which
is
what's
involved
in
this
case
as
we
understand
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
we
don’t
believe
that
a
pattern
or
practice
language
of
the
statute
is
limited
to
purposeful
discrimination,
but
this
case
is
concerned
only
with
purposeful
discrimination.
i
think
i
can
explain
this
by
briefly
discussing
these.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh,
no
i
think
that
it
would
still
be
open
for
such
a
finding
to
be
made
in
the
case,
if
you
are
not
satisfied.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
court
was
left
in
doubt
about
that,
but
i
don’t
see
any
room
for
doubt
about
that
and
then
beyond
that
there
is
the
question
of
whether
the
other
type
of
suit
would
be
applied
here,
but
i
don’t
see
any
basis
for
conceiving
of
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
here
as
being
based
on
the
rationale
of
griggs
that
unintentional
effects
from
the
application
of
standards
or
of
tests
have
to
be
justified
as
a
business
necessity
because
the
case
never
even
got
to
the
point
of
showing
what
standard
was
disqualifying
a
disproportionate
number
of
blacks
in
the
statistical
showing
to
even
raise
a
question
of
whether
that’s
a
justifiable
standard
to
have
that
effect.
the
case
as
it's
decided
here
on
the
face
of
it,
involves
a
conclusion
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
prima
facie
showing
has
been
made
here
that
no
explanation
other
than
raised
accounts
for
the
showing
of
a
disparate
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it
is
fundamentally
a
question
of
law.
of
course
it's
mixed
with
questions
of
fact,
but
it's
fundamentally
a
question
of
law
whether
we
made
a
prima
facie
showing
discrimination
that
stands
un-rebutted.
now,
let
me
just
anticipate
a
little
bit
the
analysis
that
i
was
intending
to
give
here
on
page
8
(b)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
of
the
four
prongs
of
the
showing
that
we
did
make
in
this
case.
the
first,
a
history
of
discriminatory
practice
is
prior
to
the
extension
of
title
vii,
to
state
in
local
governments
and
that
started
off
and
i
have
to
differ
with
opposing
counsel
on
that
point
with
a
de
jure
discriminatory
hiring
practice
that
was
in
effect
and
required
by
missouri
law
and
in
effect
in
the
hazelwood
district
prior
to
this
court’s
decision
in
brown
against
board
of
education.
it's
true
there
was
no
segregation
of
students
or
teachers
in
hazelwood,
but
missouri
law
required
every
school
district,
including
hazelwood
to
hire
only
white
teachers
to
teach
white
students
and
only
black
teachers
to
teach
black
students
and
they
had
nothing,
but
white
students
at
hazelwood.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
it
is.
it
is
part
of
the
background
here
to
the
period
in
which
the
statute
was
in
effect.
there
was
an
enormous
momentum
of
hiring
practices,
built
up
here,
a
system
that
was
based
on
the
hiring
of
only
white
teachers
by
white
supervisory
personnel
which
continued
up
to
1969,
there
was
never
a
black
teacher
hired.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
think
they
could
violate
the
statute
only
by
past
acts,
but
we
are
not
in
that
situation
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
explains
it
in
a
sense
and
if
the
statute
were
the
district’s
only
obligation,
sure,
but
they
knew
at
least
since
1954,
that
their
obligation
was
not
to
engage
in
racial
discrimination
in
hiring
and
had
such
a
policy
adopted
for
the
district
sometime
prior
to
1964,
yet
their
hiring
continued
to
be
exclusively
of
whites
until
1969
and
then
very
predominantly
of
whites,
every
year
right
up
to
statute
enactment
and
then
during
the
years
after
the
statute
enactment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
part
of
the
obligation
arises
out
of
the
situation
in
which
the
district
found
it
self
because
part
of
what
the
statute
is
aimed
at
is
the
perpetuation
of
past
discriminatory
practices
and
when
you
have
had
a
system
setup
so
that
all
of
your
feeder
teacher
institutions
which
you
have
been
recruiting
and
hiring
over
the
years
are
geared
to
providing
predominantly
white
faculty,
some
effort
has
to
be
made
to
change
that
pattern
of
hiring
into
a
non
discriminatory
pattern,
yes,
it
is
that
obligation
at
the
outset
of
the
statutory
(inaudible).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh,
not
to
equalize
or
employ
more
blacks
than
whites,
but
to
revise
the
hiring
practices
into
a
non
discriminatory
pattern
of
hiring,
so
that
if
we
came
forward
with
a
prima
facie
showing
of
discrimination
in
the
results
both
as
to
particular
individuals
and
in
the
overall
pattern
of
hiring,
the
state
could
show
that
it's
practices
are
not
discriminatory,
which
they
didn’t
(inaudible).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
maybe
not
in
itself
without
some
indication
which
this
record
shows
of
the
quantity
of
teachers
being
hired.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
rate
of
hire
of
what?
i
mean,
he
is
saying
the
rate
of
hire
of
applicants,
we
don’t
know
the
race
of
the
applicants
and
there
are
serious
problems
with
looking
only
at
the
applicants
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
applicant
group
may
well
be
distorted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
had
a
burden
of
presenting
a
prima
facie
case
and
we
presented
a
prima
facie
case
that
was
partly
statistical
in
nature,
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
statistics
that
opposing
counsel
is
talking
about.
our
statistical
showing
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
treatment
of
applicants
and
their
contention
is
based
on
an
interpolation
from
bits
and
pieces
of
the
record
that
were
not
designed
to
then
make
a
statistical
case
for
either
the
plaintiffs
or
the
defendants.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
we
went
way
beyond
two
or
three
months
after
the
act
was
passed,
went
back
and
forwards.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
all
part
of
the
background.
i
mean,
if
one
considers
some
of
that
excessive,
it
doesn’t
detract
from
what
we
have
shown
during
the
1972-73
and
the
1973-74
periods.
this
suit
was
brought
early
on
in
the
history
of
the
act’s
extension
to
state
local
governments
because
there
was
reason
to
move
in
this
particular
area
where
you
had
a
history
of
a
number
of
all
white
faculties
in
suburban
school
districts
and
this
being
the
largest
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
the
moment
it
was
passed
and
that
really
isn't
presented
here.
that’s
been
presented
hypothetically
in
questioning
that
the
suit
was
brought
some
time
after
that
and
the
evidence
had
to
do
with
their
hiring
practices,
everyone
of
the
16
individuals
that
court
of
appeals
found
had
been
discriminated
against
in
hiring,
those
occurrences
were
during
the
statutory
period,
not
during
the
pre-statutory
period
and
the
other
50,
the
others
of
the
50
some
odd
that
we
presented
evidence
with
respect
to,
all
occurring
during
the
statutory
period.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
would
depend
on
what
your
evidence
showed
and
part
of
the
point
of
having…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
not
just
equally
confident.
if
you
look
at
the
findings
that
are
involved
here,
there
are
a
number
of
instances
in
which
whites
who
had
been
on
academic
probation
and
had
other
basis.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
a
fact
presented
in
the
record
here
and
not
contradicted
by
anything
found
by
the
district
court
in
its
treatment
of
these
individuals.
the
district
court
simply
didn’t
make
us
detail
the
finding
with
respect
to
each
of
these
individuals,
but
as
you
notice
we
have
summarized
some
of
them
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
which
there
is
instance
after
instance
of
an
individual
who
was
black,
who
applied,
who
didn’t
get
the
job
and
then
persons
who
had
been
on
probation,
suspended
and
dismissed
from
college
and
academic
probation
had
very
low
grade
etcetera
who
were
white
who
were
hired
for
the
same
job
opportunities.
these
are
not
mild
instances.
on
the
face
of
it,
they
indicated
discrimination
and
part
of
what
opposing
counsel
has
been
contending
here,
what
the
petitioners
have
been
contending
is
that
their
practices
themselves
are
non
discriminatory
and
as
to
that
the
evidence
of
pre
act
discrimination
in
results
is
very
probative
because
they
are
following
the
same
practice
that’s
for
years
resulted
in
first
an
all
white
and
then
a
virtually
all
white
faculty,
at
a
time
when
they
were
under
a
fourteenth
amendment
obligation
not
to
discriminate
in
their
hiring
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
showing
would
certainly
not
be
a
prima
facie
statistical
showing
of
discrimination
against
blacks
hired.
it
might
be
individuals
who
were
discriminated
against,
it
might
be
evidence
of
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
hypothetically
it's
very
different
from
this
case,
yes
(inaudible)…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
might
very
well,
on
the
face
of
it
of
course.
you
would
have
to
know
something
more
about
the
case,
but
on
the
face
of
it
they
might
well
be
an
answer.
here
there
wasn’t
any
answer
authored,
any
of
the
prima
facie
case.
that
was
part
of
the
difficulty
here.
after
we
introduced
our
statistical
evidence,
historical
evidence,
the
evidence
with
the
standard
lists,
procedures
being
used
and
the
evidence
of
the
individual
instances
of
discrimination,
the
rebuttal
other
than
simple
cross
examination
of
our
witnesses
was
summarized
by
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
7b
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
quite
accurately
as
follows.
the
school
district
had
presented
one
witness
and
several
exhibits.
the
witness
testified
to
the
total
number
of
teachers
who
applied
and
were
hired
during
the
1971-72
and
1973-74
school
years
and
you
can
see
the
figures
there
at
the
bottom
of
page
7b
which
indicated
hiring
in
access
of
200
teachers
per
year
during
the
statutory
period
and
the
exhibits
consisted
of
the
policy
manual,
policy
books,
staff
handbook
and
historical
summary
of
the
formation
of
the
hazelwood
school
district
and
then
at
the
top
of
page
8b,
hazelwood
argued
that
no
discrimination
could
be
proved
because
equal
employment
opportunity
was
it's
official
policy
and
because
of
the
small
numbers
of
black
teachers
was
comparable
to
the
small
number
of
black
students
enrolled
in
hazelwood
schools
and
beyond
that
the
only
defense
offered
was
an
attempt
by
hazelwood
to
contend
that
it
was
following
a
policy
of
hiring
the
best
qualified
and
vast
majority
of
the
best
qualified
applicants
were
white
and
for
that
reason
there
was
a
very
small
number
of
blacks,
10
up
to
the
time
that
hazelwood
was
notified
that
our
investigation
was
underway
with
that
information
as
a
footnote
10
on
page
7
of
our
record,
for
that
reason
there
was
a
very
small
number
of
blacks
hired
and
because
that
was
the
defense,
our
evidence
focused
on
showing
who
was
hired
in
place
of
the
unsuccessful
black
applicants.
we
introduced
extensive
evidence
with
respect
to
which
of
these
people
hired
had
poor
academic
records,
been
on
academic
probation
and
that
sort
of
thing.
in
buttressing
our
statistical
case
and
the
rest
of
our
showing,
we
did
try
to
isolate
some
examples
of
the
individuals
who
were
discriminated
against,
but
we
know
we’re
purported
to
do
an
exhaustive
study
of
the
application
list
to
the
extent
they
were
even
available,
in
an
effort
to
ascertain
what
is
total
number
or
what
percentage
of
applicants
had
been
black
or
had
been
white.
in
fact,
the
united
states
expressly
at
the
beginning
of
its
case
on
trial
and
this
is
setout
in
full
as
explanation
of
our
introduction
of
any
of
this
material
on
page
11
of
the
brief
filed
in
our
support
by
the
naacp
legal
defense
fund
and
there
we
said
that
the
outset
of
the
case
in
view
of
the
district’s
action
severely
restricting
the
pool
of
available
qualified
black
applicants
and
its
practice
of
destroying
applications
filed
after
one
year,
it
is
not
been
possible
to
obtain
facts
on
all
or
probably
most
black
applicants
to
the
district
and
we
have
collected
in
our
brief
in
footnote
93
on
page
26th,
the
number
of
the
examples
of
black
applicants
whose
application
could
not
be
found
by
the
district,
even
though
they
were
during
the
period
when
supposedly
the
applications
had
not
yet
been
destroyed…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
individuals
testified
that
they…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
yes
or
were
deposed.
now,
as
this
statement
went
on
to
say,
however,
we
have
been
able
to
locate
and
identify
at
least
50
or
60
black
applicants
for
1972-1973
and
1973-1974,
who
the
evidence
will
show
applied
for
positions
for
which
there
were
vacancies
and
that
hazelwood
consistently
hired
white
applications,
either
less
or
no
better
qualified
for
the
vacancy.
now,
the
record
is
actually
very
sketchy
on
how
we
identify
these
50
or
60
because
no
defense
was
ever
made
that
black
applicants
were
being
treated
better
than
white
applicants.
the
whole
defense
was
the
other
way
around
that
the
whites
hired
were
better
qualified
than
the
blacks
and
that
is
why
so
few
blacks
were
being
hired.
it
was
not
part
of
our
statistical
showing
to
try
to
compare
how
the
applicant
pool
was
being
treated.
so
the
record
does
not
really
show
what
happened
here
in
any
detail,
but
all
that
did
happened
was
that
a
search
was
made
through
the
records
to
pull
out
some
examples
of
black
applicants
based
on
knowledge
of
predominantly
black
high
schools
or
colleges
that
they
might
have
attended
or
some
other
indication
on
the
face
of
the
application
whether
that
individual
is
black,
this
was
not
part
of
an
effort
to
build
a
statistical
case,
it
was
an
effort
to
identify
some
particular
victims
of
discrimination
for
that
part
of
our
prima
facie
showing
and
then
interview
those
people
and
the
course
of
those
interviews,
they
would
be
asked
you
know
of
anyone
else,
(voice
overlap)
the
applicants.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
statistical
case…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
part
one
of
the
four
parts
of
our
prima
facie
case.
that
is
comparison
with
the
other
employers
drawing
from
that
employment
area,
there
was
a
gross
statistical
disparity
in
the
number
of
--
in
the
percentage
of
black.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
there
had
been
findings
of
the
16…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
an
important
part
of
the
case
given
the
limited
period,
but
period
is
not
as
limited
as
your
hypothetical,
but
as
the
difference
have
greater
probative
value
than
they
would
under
your…
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
statistics
do
show
that
the
rate
of
hiring
is
in
itself
under
the
percentage
in
the
labor
market.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
showed
that
in
these
statistics.
they
show
when
284
were
being
hired
altogether
and
only
seven
or
nine
whatever
it
was
were
black
that
is
way
under
the
15%.
you
do
not
have
to
compare
it
only
with
the
total
workforce.
the
statistics
also
show
that
the
rate
of
hiring
in
itself
as
way
under
that
percentage.
so
it
is
all
part
of
the
prima
facie
showing
that
was
made
here.
the
point
is
that
the
other
attempt
to
interpolate
then
statistics
raises
evidentiary
questions
that
were
not
explored
below,
not
only
about
how
incomplete
those
statistics
were,
but
we
never
introduced
any
evidence
on
discriminatory
reputation
to
show
that
the
applicant
flow
to
hazelwood
was
being
distorted
because
there
was
never
any
reason
to
have
to
introduce
that.
the
defense
was
not
that
black
applicants
were
being
treated
better
than
white
applicants.
that
was
not
put
an
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
something
very
similar
to
what
the
court
was
referring
to
in
castaneda
against
partida
--
attempt
to
put
forward
a
new
array
of
a
different
statistical
case
that
is
based
on
untested
assumptions,
that
were
not
explored
below
because
the
whole
theory
of
the
defense
was
different
below
and
it
seems
to
us
this
an
attempt
to
rebut
our
prima
facie
showing
comes
to
light,
when
it
is
based
on
evidentiary
questions
and
the
evidence
is
not
there.
my
time
is
expired
as
there
are
answer
further
questions.
