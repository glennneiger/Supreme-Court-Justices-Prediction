mr.
william
h.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
charges
by
the
government
that
the
hazelwood
school
district
in
suburban
of
st.
louis
discriminated
against
black
applicants
for
teaching
positions
in
violation
of
the
civil
rights
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
1964.
after
a
trial,
the
district
court
found
the
charges
not
substantiated
and
granted
judgment
for
the
school
district.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
directed
the
order
entry
of
a
remedial
order.
in
this
court
two
questions
are
raised
on
review
of
the
court
of
appeals’
judgment.
one
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
could
legally
find
in
violation
of
title
vii
on
the
basis
of
a
comparison
of
the
proportion
of
black
members
of
hazelwood’s
faculty,
with
the
proportion
of
blacks
among
teachers
in
the
whole
st.
louis
area
when
evidence
was
available
in
the
record,
as
we
contend
to
show
that
hazelwood
did
not
discriminate
against
actual
black
applicants
for
jobs.
the
other
question
is
whether
given
the
findings
and
the
evidence
on
which
those
findings
rest,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
which
we
submit
lack
the
element
of
purpose,
there
is
any
constitutional
basis
or
the
application
of
title
vii
to
this
public
school
district.
since,
it
was
formed
about
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago,
the
hazelwood
school
district
has
grown….
mr.
william
h.
allen
we
have
no
constitutional
claim.
there
is
no
doubt
your
honor
that
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
regard
to
the
commerce
clause,
congress
can
enforce
the
equal
protection
clause,
yes.
the
hazelwood
district
in
25
years
has
grown
from
a
small
rural
collection
of
grammar
schools
to
rather
good
sized
suburban
school
system.
the
area
it
serves
is
a
populous
outlying
suburb
of
st.
louis,
a
predominantly
white
suburb.
there
were
no
black
residents
in
the
district
of
1954.
consequently
hazelwood
never
maintained
the
system
of
separate
schools
that
was
required
by
missouri
law
up
until
the
time
of
the
brown
against
board
of
education.
there
were
59
black
students
in
the
school
year
1967-68
and
nearly
600
out
of
25000
total
enrollments
in
the
school
year
1973-74.
hazelwood
hired
its
first
black
teacher
in
1969.
by
the
school
year
1973-74,
22
of
a
faculty
of
a
faculty
of
about
1200
were
blacks.
the
official
policy
of
the
district,
since
sometime
before
1964,
has
been
to
hire
the
most
competent,
the
best
qualified
teachers
without
regard
to
race,
color
or
other
extraneous
factors.
in
the
1960s,
hazelwood
had
to
engage
in
rather
extensive
recruiting
in
order
to
find
the
most
qualified,
most
competent
teachers
it
wanted.
at
that
time
the
demand
for
teachers
was
greater
than
the
supply.
today
recruiting
is
not
nearly
so
necessary.
hazelwood
indeed
is
deluged
with
applications
for
teaching
positions,
ten
or
a
dozen
for
every
vacancy.
these
applications
are
received
in
a
central
office,
hazelwood’s
personnel
office.
there,
in
that
central
office,
vacancies
are
made
known
by
the
school
principals
and
the
central
office
is
asked
to
refer
applicants
for
interviews
and
they
are
referred
for
interviews
without
any
real
evaluation
of
their
qualifications.
at
the
individual
schools,
when
the
interviews
are
conducted,
they
are
conducted
by
principals
and
in
some
cases
in
the
secondary
schools
by
department
heads.
they
seek
through
the
interviewing
process
to
find
the
best
qualified
or
most
competent
teachers.
title
vii
was
made
applicable
to
hazelwood
and
other
public
bodies
in
march
of
1972.
few
months
later,
in
october,
the
justice
department
gave
hazelwood
notice
that
it
was
considering
filing
a
title
vii
case
against
it.
the
suit
was
actually
filed
in
august
1973.
it
alleged
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
against
black
applicants
for
teaching
positions
in
violation
of
title
vii
and
in
addition
alleged
a
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment.
the
government
searched
through
hazelwood’s
files
of
applications,
employment
forms
and
the
like.
it
took
depositions
of
hazelwood’s
top
school
administrators,
principals,
superintendents,
personnel
officers
and
so
forth.
exhibits
that
were
consisted
of
copies
of
the
file
material
were
constructed
from
that
file
material
were
a
principal
part
of
the
government’s
case
at
trial,
the
depositions
came
in
at
trial
and
in
addition,
25
black
applicants
for
teaching
positions
testified
as
to
the
circumstances
of
their
applications.
the
government
set
out
to
prove
that
hazelwood
had
deliberately,
purposefully
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination
against
black
job
applicants
generally,
a
showing
of
a
few
isolated
cases
of
unfavorable
treatment
of
the
individuals,
black
applicants
for
teaching
positions
would
not
do
to
make
the
kind
of
case
that
the
government
set
out
to
make.
the
government
tried
to
show
that
hazelwood’s
hiring
procedures,
its
decentralized
system
of
interviewing
that
i
described,
disfavored
black
applicants
generally.
the
fact
was
the
hazelwood’s
files
showed
the
contrary
that
between
1971
and
1973,
17
black
applicants
were
hired
or
offered
jobs
and
52
were
identified
by
the
government
as
having
been
rejected
for
teaching
jobs.
it's
on
the
face
of
it;
that
is
a
much
greater
proportion
of
hires
than
they
were
for
applicants
generally
in
that
period.
so
the
government
adopted
as
the
centerpiece
of
it's
attempted
showing
of
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination,
a
comparison
of
the
racial
composition
of
the
hazelwood’s
faculty
in
1973-74,
approximately
2%
black
with
the
racial
composition
of
the
st.
louis
city
and
county
teachers.
in
other
words,
as
shown
by
the
census
of
the
1970,
15%
of
all
the
teachers
in
st.
louis
city
and
county
were
black.
in
addition,
the
government
noted
that
an
ad,
a
newspaper
advertisement
for
features
that
appeared
jackson,
mississippi
over
hazelwood’s
name
back
in
1962,
with
the
words
white
only
in
it,
the
same
ad
had
run
else
where
without
that
notation
at
the
same
time,
that
hazelwood
had
used
application
forms
up
until
1962-63,
some
of
which
carried
lines
for
racial
identification,
that
hazelwood
had
not
recruited
a
pre-dominantly
black
colleges
in
the
1960s
when
recruitment
was
a
part
of
it's
hiring
process.
in
addition,
the
government
also
cited
the
cases
of
the
52
unsuccessful
black
applicants
that
it
had
identified
and
said
that
they
had
been
rejected
in
the
favor
of
whites,
no
better
qualified.
hazelwood
argued
that
none
of
this
showed
discrimination,
district
court
agreed.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
found…
mr.
william
h.
allen
judge
harper,
your
honor.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
discrepancy
between
the
racial
composition
of
the
hazelwood’s
faculty
and
this
st.
louis
city
and
county
labor
market
taken
in
light
of
what
it
termed
unstructured
standard-less
hiring
procedures
with
vague
and
subjective
criteria
made
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
in
violation
of
title
vii.
mr.
william
h.
allen
court
of
appeals
recited
that
there
was
the
charge
of
a
violation
of
a
fourteenth
amendment
at
the
outset
of
this
opinion.
it
found
that
no
such
violation
in
the
course
of
its
opinion.
i
think
it
is
fair
mr.
rehnquist
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
a
violation
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
found
that
this
prima
facie
case
that
it
based
principally
on
the
statistics
of
a
violation
of
title
vii
was
buttressed
by
these
incidents
from
hazelwood’s
history
that
i
recited
and
its
analysis
of
the
government
showing
of
rejected
black
applicants.
on
that
analysis,
it
found
that
16
out
of
52
of
the
black
applicants
had
been
rejected
for
jobs
for
which
whites
no
better
qualified
had
later
been
hired
and
of
those
16,
only
2
had
gone
through
the
interview
process
which
was
a
only
part
of
whole
hiring
procedure
of
which
the
court
was
critical.
it
did
not
in
our
view,
this
has
become
a
matter
of
contention,
but
in
our
view
it
clearly,
the
court
did
not
find
purposeful
discrimination
and
as
i
have
said
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
it
did
not
find
a
violation
of
a
fourteenth
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
placing
its
reliance
on
the
workforce
labor
market
comparison.
my
argument
on
that
score
is
a
simple
one.
i
think,
despite
the
impression
that
might
be
gotten
from
the
rather
extensive
discussion
of
the
record
that
appears
in
the
briefs
here.
let
me
try
to
make
it
simple.
that
sort
of
comparison
of
racial
composition
of
an
employer’s
workforce
and
of
the
racial
composition
of
a
labor
market
is
in
some
circumstances
a
valid
test
for,
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
title
vii,
but
the
circumstances
simply
did
not
obtain
here.
for
one
thing,
the
circumstances
didn’t
obtain
because
of
the
problem
induced
or
the
labor
market
statistics
by
the
hiring
practices
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
schools;
that
city
of
st.
louis
schools
deliberately
tried
and
succeeded
in
maintaining
an
approximate
50/50
ratio
balance
between
blacks
and
whites.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
it
abuts
in
a
sense
your
honor.
the
city
of
st.
louis
as
i
understand
that
runs
north
along
the
ballast
of
mississippi
river
and
there
is
a
small
point
there
where
the
hazelwood
district
which
generally
lies
north
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
abuts
it,
but
in
no
realistic
sense
is
that
a
channel
of
trade
or
communication
between
the
two.
it
is
fairly
described
as
an
outlying
district.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
is
a
part
of
st.
louis
county,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
don’t
think
that
is
the
case,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
i
think
not
your
honor.
i
think
our
statistical
analysis
is
based
on
the
preposition
that
there
are
not
15%
of
teachers
in
the
workforce,
who
are
black
in
st.
louis
city
and
county,
who
are
available
for
hire
by
hazelwood.
the
government’s
position
as
i
understand
is
that
the
workforce
comparison
is
legitimate
because
absent
discrimination,
it
means
that
would
be
the
composition
of
the
employer’s
workforce
and
that
situation
is
simply
not
true
here
where
one
has
this
distorting
effect,
that
is
our
position
in
that
regard.
but
there
is
really
a
deeper
and
more
basic
flaw
in
the
use
of
the
workforce
labor
market
comparison
in
this
case.
at
its
best,
even
if
constructed
validly,
that
comparison
is
a
get
only.
for
a
true
comparison
of
how
an
employer
has
treated
black
applicants,
actual
black
applicants
for
job
on
the
one
hand
and
how
it
has
treated
applicants
generally
on
the
other
hand.
now,
the
government
does
not
deny
that.
i
don’t
think,
they
don’t
acknowledge
it,
but
they
don’t
deny
it.
it
seems
an
obvious
enough
point.
they
say
that
this
latter
evidence
was
not
available
in
the
record,
but
there
was
that
evidence
in
the
record.
evidence
as
to
the
number
of
applications
generally
and
number
of
hires
generally,
the
number
of
black
applicants
and
the
number
of
black
applicants
hired
and
that
evidence
as
i
have
indicated
showed
that
blacks
faired
at
least
as
well
as
whites
in
the
periods
1971-72,
1972-73,
and
1973-74.
mr.
william
h.
allen
52
unsuccessful
black
applicants.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
now
going
to
turn
to
because
that
is
the
government’s
principal
position
with
respect
to
the
applicant
flow
data
and
it's
important
to
understand,
there
were
six
black
members
of
the
hazelwood
faculty
at
the
beginning
of
the
1971-72
school
year.
at
least
16
were
hired
by
1973-74
because
there
were
22
on
the
faculty
in
1973-74.
mr.
william
h.
allen
in
october
1972
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
it
did
not.
in
fact
well,
i
suppose
it
could
your
honor.
the
fact
was
that
there
were
13,
according
to
the
district
court,
13
black
members
of
the
faculty
in
the
fall
of
1972,
presumably
before
the
notification
had
been
given
although
after
title
vii
was
made
applicable.
mr.
william
h.
allen
as
far
as
i
know
it
was
october
of
1972
your
honor.
the
record
doesn’t
show
any
earlier
date.
i
suppose
there
may
have
been
an
earlier
date,
i
don’t
know.
there
were
17
all
told
in
this
period
who
were
either
hired
or
offered
jobs.
in
that
same
period
the
government
as
i
have
said
identified
52
unsuccessful
black
applicants.
so
rate
of
success
was
about
25%
on
the
face
of
those
figures.
at
the
same
time,
there
were
7800
applications
generally,
of
whom
640
were
hired,
overall
rate
of
success
of
8%.
now,
in
addendum
a
to
our
reply
brief,
we
have
made
allowances
for
any
black
applicants
that
maybe
missing
from
among
those
that
the
government
identified.
mr.
william
h.
allen
this
data
as
i
understand,
have
to
be
gathered
specially
for
the
government,
in
other
words,
the
identification
were
made
specifically
for
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
don’t
know.
mr.
william
h.
allen
mr.
justice
marshall,
one
way
that
the
figures…
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
with
respect
to
applicants
yes
your
honor.
with
respect
to
successful
applicants
there
are
reports
formally
to
the
department
of
health
education
welfare,
now
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
that
asked
for
a
racial
breakdown
of
faculty
and
those
reports
are
in
the
record,
but
the
racial
identification
of
the
applications
was
made
in
part
by
the
school
district
as
i
understand
and
part
by
the
fbi
which
went
through
the
school
district’s
records.
the
record,
i
submit,
shows
that
there
are
no
significant
numbers
of
black
applicants
who
were
not
identified
by
the
fbi.
all
the
applications
for
1973
and
74
school
year,
and
the
1972-73
were
available
to
the
fbi
at
the
time
it
conducted
its
file
search,
some
from
1971-72.
hazelwood
school
principals
were
deposed,
their
depositions
were
taken.
they
were
all
about
the
blacks
they
had
interviewed.
the
analysis
of
their
testimony
and
deposition
is
in
the
addendum
b
to
our
reply
brief
and
indicates
that
at
most
a
very
few
black
applicants
who
were
interviewed
are
unaccounted
for
and
70%
on
the
basis
of
the
figures
that
are
known,
70%
of
the
black
applicants
who
were
interviewed
or
known
to
have
been
interviewed
or
identified
as
having
been
interviewed,
70%
of
them
were
hired
and
that
is
a
larger
percentage
than
obtained
for
applicants.
generally
although
that
precise
figure
is
not
of
record,
it
can't
be,
an
estimate
can
be
made
of
how
many
interviews
there
were
for
the
numbers
of
hires
and
the
proportion
would
be
much
less
without
it
generally.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
would
not
be
a
clearly
erroneous
type
of
finding.
i
think
this
is
a
question
of
law
as
to
the
showing
that
has
to
be
made
in
order
to
justify
a
holding
that
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
under
title
vii.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i
don’t
know
if
the
government
would
concede
that.
mr.
william
h.
allen
this
is
a
pattern
or
practice
type
of
case.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
we
believe
your
honor
that
in
the
deciding
the
case
principally
on
the
basis
of
the
workforce
labor
market
comparison,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
what
amounts
to
and
effects
case,
regardless
of
what
the
case
may
have
been
conceived
of
by
the
government
at
the
beginning,
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
itself
draw
the
further
inference
of
purpose
from
the
findings
it
made
and
we
submit
that
given
the
infirmity
of
the
statistical
showing,
given
the
reputation
of
it
in
the
applicant
flow
data
that
i
have
been
talking
about
that
no
such
finding
could
have
been
made.
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
the
court
of
appeals
found
16
cases
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
identifiable
discrimination.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
don’t
suggest,
there
is
no
significance,
let
me..
mr.
william
h.
allen
let
me
state
two
or
three
things
about
it.
first
the
government
in
opposing
certiorari
suggested
that
it
was
a
dispositive
significance,
said
that
the
judgment
could
be
affirmed
on
that
basis
solely.
they
abandoned
that
decision
in
argument
the
merits
and
no
longer
claimed
that.
that
is
a
preface
to
what
i
was
going
to
say
about.
the
fact
is
your
honor
that
the
16
cases
out
of
52
do
not
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
because
hazelwood
showed
that
the
hiring
procedures
that
the
applicants
were
subjected
to
were
operated
fairly
in
the
generality
of
cases.
mr.
william
h.
allen
they
have
resulted
in
16
cases…
mr.
william
h.
allen
what
they
resulted
in
your
honor
was
16
cases
in
which
the
mcdonnell
douglas
four
point
test
was
satisfied
and
i
suggest
that
even
in
a
case
where
the
rest
of
the
evidence
was
neutral
as
to
the
fairness
of
the
hiring
procedures
and
that’s
not
this
case,
in
this
case
there
is
positive
evidence
of
the
hiring
procedure
were
fair.
even
in
another
case,
the
satisfaction
in
mcdonnell
douglas
test
does
not
lead
necessarily
or
even
always
reasonably
to
a
finding
that
there
was
purposeful
discrimination
and
certainly
not
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discrimination.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i
think
you
happen
to
go
one
further
step
your
honor
and
to
find
that
these
16
cases,
two
of
whom
were
interviewed,
only
two
of
whom
were
interviewed,
the
others
were
all
that
happened
to
them
was
they
were
not
referred
for
interviews
according
to
this
mechanical
process
of
referrals
that
i
referred
to.
mr.
william
h.
allen
in
a
case
like
this
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
the
applicant
flow
data
that
were
in
the
record
showed
that
a
much
lower
proportion
of
black
applicants
were
being
hired
than
white
applicants,
i
wouldn’t
have
any
problem
with
even
inferring
purposeful
discrimination,
if
the
discrepancy
were
great
enough
in
that
case,
but
that
is
not
what
this
record
shows.
mr.
william
h.
allen
you
certainly
can
show
by
proper
statistics
one
can
make
a
case
from
which
purpose
can
it
be
inferred.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well,
i…
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
think
not
quite.
you
have
to
take
one
further
step
mr.
justice
brennan
and
that
is
to
find
that
the
cases
of
the
16
made
a
pattern
or
practice
by
themselves
of
discrimination.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
that
in
a
situation
of
this
sort
where
there
were
thousands
of
applications
each
year
for
teaching
positions,
it
is
not
all
blacks
are
going
to
be
hired,
just
as
not
all
whites
were
hired.
yes
your
honor?
mr.
william
h.
allen
yes,
thousands.
mr.
william
h.
allen
well
there
are
two
separate
points
your
honor,
i
did
not
really
get
to
the…
mr.
william
h.
allen
no,
i
think
your
honor
i
think
that
is
not
quite
what
my
argument
is.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
the
evidence
to
support
that
finding,
yeah,
we
have
argued
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
allen
cannot
constitutionally
be
applied
to
a
public…
mr.
william
h.
allen
i
have
not
argued
that
this
morning,
i
have
devoted
my
self
to
the
other
point
which
i
thought
would
be
better
elucidated
by
counsel’s
argument.
mr.
william
h.
allen
may
it
please
the
court,
in
its
brief,
in
the
time
dc
case,
here
this
term,
the
government
has
said
that
a
pattern
case
requires
more
than
isolated
rejections
of
qualified
individuals.
we
submit
that
that
is
why
the
government
has
not
argued,
that
the
cases
of
the
16
establish
its
prima
facie
case
here
and
if
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan’s
question,
i
say
that
we
acknowledged
that
the
test
of
mcdonald
douglas
was
met
in
the
case
of
those
applicants,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
so.
we
have
assumed
that
arguendo
in
some
points
in
arguing
the
case.
mr.
william
h.
allen
16
blacks
have
been
hired.
mr.
william
h.
allen
and
some
were
on
that
order
of…
mr.
william
h.
allen
since
the
act
was
passed
your
honor
and
that
is
a
function
of
the
relative
number
of
applications
because
if
one
picks
the
number
of
applications
and
compares
the
number
of
blacks
hired
and
the
number
of
the
non-blacks
hired,
the
blacks
at
their
better
and
i
earnestly
solicit
your
attention
to
pages
3
to
8
of
our
reply
brief
and
agenda
a
and
b
to
that
reply
brief
for
a
demonstration
of
the
mere
completeness
of
the
showing
of
the
number
of
the
black
applicants
in
the
period
in
question.
thank
you.
