brennan,
jr.
mr.
allen,
what
do
you
do
of
my
rights
that
you
say
earlier,
the
district
court
found
16…

j.

identifiable…
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
in
the
sense
that
no
more
qualified
rights
likes
were
hired?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
suggest
it
holds
significance
to
the
attachment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
it
dispositive
significance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
withstanding
which,
however
fairly
they
operated,
they
resulted
in
16
cases
of
identifiable
discrimination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn’t
strike
me
as
a
very
fairly
operated
procedure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
allen,
have
you
finished
your
answer
to
me?
