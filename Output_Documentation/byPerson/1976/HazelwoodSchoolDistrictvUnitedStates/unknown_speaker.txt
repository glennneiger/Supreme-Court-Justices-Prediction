unknown
speaker
but
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
purpose,
that
your
question
is
answered.
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
who
was
the
district
judge,
judge
harper.
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
let
me
get
my
geography
straight.
hazelwood
abuts
on
st.
louis
county?
unknown
speaker
is
it
part
of
st.
louis
county?
unknown
speaker
and
why
do
you
think
every
black
teacher
applicant
in
the
st.
louis
area
would
rather
go
to
st.
louis
than
to
hazelwood?
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
your
statistical
analysis
based
on
that
assumption?
unknown
speaker
the
record
identifies
52
black
applicants.
unknown
speaker
52
unsuccessful,
does
the
record
indicate
whether
or
not
some
of
the
other
unsuccessful
applicants
may
also
have
been
black?
unknown
speaker
when
was
it
that
you
found
that
the
federal
government
was
after
you?
unknown
speaker
could
that
account
for
the
additional…
unknown
speaker
now,
this
question
was
when
you
had
an
official
notification,
when
they
found
that
the
federal
government
was
moving
around?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
pattern
of
practice.
apart
of
that
there
are
two
basic
types
of
title
vii
violations,
are
there
not?
there
is
the
griggs
v.
duke
power
type
which
deals
only
with
effects,
the
(inaudible)
effect
and
then
there
is
this
type
in
which
there
has
to
be
a
proof
of
a
discriminatory
purpose,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
the
policy
of
practice
of
discrimination
which
has
to
be
proved
by
the
plaintiff,
but
after
the
plaintiff
proves
certain
things
then
it
perhaps
becomes
the
duty
of
the
respondent
or
the
defendant
to
rebut
the
prima
facie
case.
that
is
a
mcdonnell
and
this
is
the
latter
type
of
case.
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
a
duke
power
type
case
at
all.
unknown
speaker
if
we
were
to
agree,
i
guess,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
even
in
purpose,
and
purposeful?
unknown
speaker
even
if
purposeful?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
are
suggesting
that
there
must
be
a
margin
of
tolerance
for
mistakes?
unknown
speaker
out
of
thousands
of
applications
to
hazel
unknown
speaker
of
course
is
not
over,
i
think
that
even
if
we
agree
with
you
that
purposeful
discrimination
was
not
shown
or
not
found
by
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
you
have
argued
and
the
answer
is
no,
the
case
is
not
over
except
we
still
have
to
decide
that
purposeful
discrimination
is
necessary
in
order
to
sustain
this
title
vii
case?
unknown
speaker
well
what
do
you
say,
do
you
say
title
vii
is
unconstitutional,
unless
it
was
a
finding
of
purposeful…
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
don’t
find
purpose
in
this
case
then
the
title
vii,
you
say
that
title
vii…
unknown
speaker
yeah,
you
haven't
argued
that.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
mr.
wallace,
since
you
are
referring
to
justice
clark’s
opinion;
at
page
3
(b)
what
seems
to
me
a
rather
central
conclusion
of
that
opinion
that
the
top
of
page
3(b)
verses,
“we
have
concluded
that
from
it's
establishment
in
1949,
1950
until
at
least
march
1974,
hazelwood
is
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
discriminatorily
failing
and
refusing
to
hire
blacks
in
violation
of
the
act
and
that
the
united
states
and
certain
black
teaching
applicants
are
entitled
to
relief.
now,
it
my
understanding
that
the
act
is
applied
to
private
individuals
was
first
enacted
in
the
1964,
and
that
it
was
made
applicable
to
the
governmental
subdivisions
only
in
1972.
do
you
support
that
statement
in
the
opinion
as
a
correct
doctrine
of
law?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
elliptical
at
all?
unknown
speaker
different
standard
is
imposed
by
title
vii
and
is
imposed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
kind
of
case.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
and
agree
with
your
adversary
that
there
was
no
finding
in
purposeful
discrimination
in
this
case,
do
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
we
would
stop
and
remand
then,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact,
in
the
sense
of,
could
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
district
court,
you
said
there
was
no
prima
facie
showing,
we
think
there
is
one,
therefore,
we
think
your
finding
was
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
you
rely
on
that
i
take
in
part
to
support
a
constitutional
violation,
but
is
that
relevant
to
the
question
whether
it
is
a
statutory
violation?
unknown
speaker
on
may
1st
of
1972
or
some
date
around
that
period
what
did
the
board
have
to
do
to
avoid
being
in
violation
of
law
at
that
particular
moment,
say
they
didn’t
hire
anybody
for
a
couple
of
months,
would
they
have
violated
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
wondering
if
the
history
does
not
put
the
other
way
because
it
explains,
i
suppose,
why
there
was
a
disproportionate
number
of
whites
being
employed
at
the
time
the
statute
went
into
effect?
unknown
speaker
are
we
asked
to
decide
a
constitutional
question
here?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you
go
back
and
forth
and
your
brief
does
the
same
thing
between
a
constitutional
problem
and
a
statutory
problem
and
i
frankly
have
some
difficulty
keeping
the
two
separate.
unknown
speaker
i
think
the
statute
imposed
an
affirmative
obligation
to
employ
more
blacks
than
whites
during
the
period
in
order
to
equalize…
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
they
shot
from
the
point
because
i
think
it
relates
to
the
statistical
showing.
supposing
two
months
after
the
statute
went
into
effect,
you
brought
a
suit,
you
put
in
evidence
that
at
that
particular
moment
in
time
99%
of
the
teachers
were
white,
would
that
tend
to
prove
any
thing?
unknown
speaker
should
we
focus
on
the
hiring
rate.
your
opponent
seems
to
argue
that
we
should
look
at
the
rate
of
hire
and
then
on
a
rate
of
hire
the
proportions
are
about
equal.
unknown
speaker
whose
burden
was
it
to
identify
the
race
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
wondering
how
your
statistical
case
differs
from
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you,
that
the
two
or
three
months
after
the
act
was
passed,
there
was
evidence
that
99%
of
the
teachers
were
white,
did
you
show
anything
more
than
that
statistically?
unknown
speaker
before
1954.
unknown
speaker
and
this
means
as
though
you’re
submitting
that
the
hazelwood
school
district
or
some
other
school
district
curbed,
be
in
violation
of
the
act,
the
moment
it
was
passed?
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
been
32
people
hired
during
the
period
that
these
16
were
discriminated
against
you
say
32
hired,
there
had
been
16
whites
and
16
blacks
hired,
and
the
16
blacks
that
weren’t
hired
are
the
ones
that
were
discriminated
against
you
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
that
they
were
equally
competent,
though
they
were
at
least
as
competent
as
the
ones
who
were
hired
and
the
ones
who
were
hired
were
white
and
that’s
your
discriminatory
showing.
unknown
speaker
these
are
findings
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
a
fact.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
get
it
straight
what
your
position
is
and
i
am
following
up
with
on
you’re
colloquially
with
justice
stevens.
if
two
years
after
the
act
was
passed
and
your
suit
was
filed,
it
assumes
that
since
this
act
was
passed,
they
have
hired
twice
as
many
negro’s
as
whites,
and
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
would
not
be
an
adequate
answer
to
your.
unknown
speaker
let
us
just
say
that
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
the
90%
of
the
employees
were
white
as
a
result
of
fourteenth
amendment
type
discrimination
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act.
as
soon
as
the
act
is
passed,
the
company
starts
hiring
twice
as
many
blacks
as
whites.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
showing,
the
actual
hiring
would
be
an
answer
to…
unknown
speaker
how
could
you
know
that
these
were
black
applicants?
is
there
a
file…
unknown
speaker
at
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
you
said
that
was
not
part
of
your
statistical
case.
your
statistical
case
was
one
that
comparison
of
the
percentage
of
black
teachers
in
hazelwood
with
the
percentage
of
black
applicants,
for
potential
applicants
in
st.
louis
metropolitan,
what
else
did
it
consist
off?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
you
say
met
your
prima
facie
burden.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace
is
it
not
correct
that
if
we
put
to
one
side
for
the
moment
the
fourth
part
of
the
test,
the
16
specific
acts
of
discrimination,
each
of
the
other
three
parts
of
the
test
would
apply
equally
to
my
hypothetical
example,
two
months
after
the
act
was
in
affect,
when
99%
would
be
white,
you
would
have
then
proved
the
prima
facie
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
i
am
saying
you
put
that
to
one
side,
i
am
just
saying
your
case
really
depends
on
the
16,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
is
it
different
in
probative
value
if
you
have
precisely
the
same
kind
of
statistical
evidence
and
it
is
the
number
of
people
employed
as
compared
with
the
total
number
or
the
percentage
in
the
labor
market
and
there
is
a
perfectly
logical
explanation
which
maybe
unhappy
one
and
an
undesirable,
but
it
is
non-statutory
explanation
for
the
predominant
number
of
whites
in
labor…
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
that
keeps
raising
in
my
mind
is
who
had
the
burden
of
showing
the
makeup
of
the
hiring
rate
and
the
failure
to
hire
more
blacks
during
the
period
after
test…?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
are
you
finished?
is
not
that
true
that
some
500
since
the
act
passed,
some
500
whites
were
hired
and
16
negros.
unknown
speaker
and
500
whites.
unknown
speaker
since
the
act
was…
