mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
court.
this
case
arose
when
the
respondent
j.
w.
gamble
filed
an
action
under
42
u.
s.
c.
section
1983
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas,
alleging
an
adequate
medical
treatment
for
a
back
injury,
which
he
has
sustained
in
filing
suit
against
the
director
of
the
texas
department
of
corrections,
the
warden
of
his
unit,
the
medical
director
who
is
also
the
chief
medical
officer
of
the
prison
hospitals.
district
court
without
requiring
the
state
to
file
a
response,
without
asking
for
any
response
summarily
dismissed
the
claim
rather
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
subsequently
reversed
the
remand
of
the
case
with
instructions
to
reinstate
the
compliant,
appoint
counsel,
and
permit
amendment.
your
honor,
the
crux
of
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
district
courts
will
in
the
future
and
the
fifth
circuit
sit
as
medical
review
boards
to
review
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
by
doctors
in
correctional
institutions
or
whether
that
federal
courts
and
the
fifth
circuit
will
operate
within
the
confines
as
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
constitution
and
by
the
jurisdictional
part
of
section
1983
which
is
28
u.
s.
c.
1343.
in
looking
at
a
complaint
it
is
established
law
by
this
court
that
a
complaint
should
not
be
dismissed
summarily
unless
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
plaintiff
can
prove
no
facts
in
support
of
his
claim,
which
would
entitle
him
to
relief.
well,
in
the
area
of
prisoner
medical
care
there
are
only
two
places
in
the
constitution
where
a
claim
can
possibly
be
stated,
one
is
underneath
the
eighth
amendment
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause,
the
other
is
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process
clause;
a
section
relating
to
life.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
no
your
honor
that
is
in
respondent’s
brief.
i
failed
to
see
how
a
creation
of
administrative
procedures
will
be
helpful
in
terms
of
an
issue
whether
a
compliant,
states
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
no,
your
honor
i
do
not
except
for
one
instance,
and
that
is
that
at
the
time
when
this
complaint
was
filed
in
1973
the
grievance
procedure
which
was
subsequently
written
into
the
rules
and
regulations,
in
other
words
the
appeal
with
the
word
and
then
to
the
director
and
director
sending
someone
down
from
the
staff
to
investigate
the
complaint.
those
were
in
effect
fact
in
1973
and
have
been
for
quite
a
while.
there
were
merely
made
written
rules
and
regulations.
they
went
through
the
formal
procedure
of
passing
it
through
the
board.
i
do
not
see
how
and
when
question
comes
up
is
to
whether
the
claim
has
been
stated,
how
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
a
grievance
procedure
would
help
in
any
matter.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
both
the
grievance
procedure
and
that
inmate
legal
assistance
project
which
was
cited
in
respondent’s
brief
the
inmate
does
not
have
to
utilize
either
one.
he
can
go
directly
in
the
federal
court
and
file
a
complaint,
and
the
established
law
in
that
area
right
now
is
that
no
exhaustion
is
required
under
section
1983
the
latest
ruling
as
the
court
knows
being
mccray
v.
burrell
by
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
as
far
as
a
flood
of
litigation
in
the
federal
courts
is
concerned,
which
the
courts
have
experienced,
the
district
courts
over
the
last
five
or
six
years
i
think
it
would
help
tremendously.
minnesota
has
had
experience
with
it;
maryland
has
had
experience
with
it.
an
independent
grievance
type
procedure
has
helped
tremendously
in
reducing
the
burden
on
the
federal
courts
and
also
the
states.
but
as
an
alternative
your
honor,
the
state
of
texas
has
a
tort
claims
act,
which
inmates
are
presently
utilizing
to
sue
the
state,
it
is
article
6252-19,
and
in
addition
to
being
able
to
sue
the
state
itself
and
obtain
money
out
of
corpus
of
the
state,
the
inmate
has
the
regular
common
law
tort
remedy
to
sue
the
doctor
individually.
so
it
is
petitioner’s
position
that
the
respondent
in
fact
has
state
remedies
and
that
the
constitution
itself
and
the
federal
courts
should
not
under
the
eighth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
hear
ordinary
negligence
from
medical
malpractice
or
tort
claims.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
the
only
thing
the
tort
claims
act
does
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
it
establishes
liability
on
the
part
of
the
state
itself.
there
is
an
alternative;
you
can
either
try
to
take
the
money
out
of
the
doctor’s
pocket
under
the
tort
claims
act
or
take
it
out
of
the
state’s
corpus.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
yes
your
honor
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
mr.
justice
stevens,
apparently
the
complaint
was
never
sent
by
the
district
court
to
our
office.
the
first
time
that
we
ever
saw
anything
about
the
case
or
heard
anything
about
the
case
was
when
an
appeal
was
filed.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
your
honor
the
practice
in
the
texas
courts
is
to
refer
the
cases
to
magistrate
both
the
habeas
corpus
cases
and
the
1983
cases.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
for
screening.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
the
magistrate
would
recommend
either
to
deny
relief
to
file
or
to
grant
relief
to
file.
what
usually
occurs
is
that
the
magistrate
will
recommend
that
the
court
give
a
list
of
recommendations
and
conclusions
and
he
will
recommend
generally
--
i
have
never
seen
one
otherwise
--
that
the
petition
be
filed,
and
there
is
an
informal
preparers
question
in
almost
all
of
these
things
it
has
to
be
decided
one
way
or
the
other.
there
is
some
determination
made
as
to
whether
an
inmate
in
fact
happens
to
be
a
pauper
we
had
some
problems
with
that,
so
that
has
to
be
decided.
also
a
question
as
to
whether
counsel
should
be
appointed
in
the
case
even
though
there
is
no
federal
statute
which
provides
the
reimbursement.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
could
not
honestly
answer
that
question
across
the
board.
i
know
it
happened
in
this
case.
we
did
not
receive
anything.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
am
not
sure
your
honor;
i
could
really
not
answer
that,
i
just
know
--
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
no,
it
has
not.
i
wish
i
could
answer
the
question,
but
i
cannot,
we
receive
the
complaints
and
generally
in
both
habeas
corpus
cases
and
section
1983
cases
--
well
i
know
in
habeas
corpus
cases
you
get
the
recommendation.
you
are
served
before
the
magistrate
ever
gets
into
the
act.
in
the
northern
districts,
all
of
the
cases
i
have
ever
handled
you
go
ahead
and
receive
the
complaint
without
ever
hearing
anything
from
the
court
and
you
go
ahead
and
answer
it.
in
this
case,
i
do
not
know
what
happened
whether
it
got
to
elsewhere.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
my
co-counsel
just
passed
me
a
note
and
i
am
a
little
nervous
this
morning.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
understand,
but
my
mind
is
not
working
too
clearly;
hopefully
it
will
be
better
as
i
go
along.
but
in
1983
cases
the
defendant
has
to
be
served,
the
defendant
themselves,
and
the
way
we
operate
is
that
in
habeas
corpus
cases
we
will
--
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
this
is
a
1983
case,
right.
i
was
trying
to
make
a
distinction,
but
in
1983
cases
the
defendant
has
to
be
served
and
we
do
not
automatically
represent
the
defendants
who
were
sued.
in
other
words,
they
have
to
request
our
office
for
representation.
so,
the
defendant
has
to
request
director
--
but
even
the
director
has
to
request
his
representation
because
there
are
numerous
cases
where
they
will
retain
private
counsel
in
1983
cases,
the
number
of
defendants
that
we
represent
like
the
howard
and
charles
(ph).
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
do
not
need
to
know
whether
we
would
serve
with
the
complaint
or
not.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
mr.
justice
marshall
i
represent
the
petitioners,
the
director.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct.
i
have
no
complaint
about
that.
mr.
justice
stevens
was
inquiring
as
to
the
procedure
that
occurred
in
this
case,
and
i
just
frankly
do
not
know.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
no
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
yes,
your
honor
it
was.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
apparently,
there
was
no
need
to
represent
the
petitioners
in
the
district
court,
because
unless
the
district
court
summarily
dismiss
without
requiring
a
response.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
not
necessarily,
but
as
a
practical
matter
most
of
the
defendants
will
request
our
representation
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases.
there
are
some
who
retain
private
counsels,
but
even
if
the
state
has
been
required
to
--
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
mr.
estelle
is
sued
thousands
of
times.
he
is
the
name
defendant
in
habeas
corpus,
every
habeas
corpus
and
every
civil
rights
case
filed
in
the
institutions.
private
counsel
would,
and
no
case
mr.
justice
marshall
where
mr.
estelle
was
requested
anyone
other
than
our
office
to
represent
him.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
for
example,
the
highway
patrolmen
frequently
have
private
counsel.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
it
may
explain
it,
i
was
really
curious
about
it;
i
know
our
office
never
heard
of
the
case
until
it
was
on
appeal.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
we
did
not
know
about
the
case,
that
is
the
reason,
and
it
would
not
make
any
difference
as
far
as
substance
is
concerned
whether
the
state
were
required
to
file
a
response
or
not.
the
state
came
back
and
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
the
claim
went
out
with
the
same
result.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
true.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct.
the
petitioner’s
position
is
that
when
a
district
court
gets
a
complaint,
which
on
its
face
clearly
fails
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted,
it
has
the
power
to
dismiss
it
without
waiting
for
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct,
and
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
and
also
the
respondent’s
brief,
it
is
very
different
for
anyone
arguing
that
there
is
a
claim
stated
here
to
get
away
from
the
difference
of
opinion
in
a
disagreement
as
far
as
diagnosis
and
treatment
is
concerned.
the
petitioner’s
brief
outlines
the
general
rule
stated
by
eighth
circuit
courts
of
appeals
when
a
motion
dismiss
is
filed
or
when
a
claim
is
filed
and
the
court
looks
at
it
and
decides
to
go
ahead
and
dismiss
it
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
summary
dismissal
in
other
words.
that
particular
test
to
get
underneath
either
the
eighth
amendment
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
clause
or
fourteenth
amendment
is
number
one,
if
there
is
a
total
failure
or
refusal
to
provide
medical
care
that
presumably
would
be
an
eighth
amendment
violation
and
might
also
be
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
do
agree
with
that.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
think
that
would
state
a
claim.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
the
court
of
appeals
here
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
total
failure
to
treat.
i
have
read
that
opinion
several
times
and
just
could
not
understand
why
they
reversed
the
district
court
and
the
conclusion
they
come
to
is
total
failure
to
treat.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
would
agree
with
the
law
that
that
is
the
law,
but
if
the
application
of
the
law
that
the
facts
were
correct,
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
--
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
an
ordinary
malpractice.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
inadequate
medical
treatment
without
any
exceptional
circumstance
like
deliberate
indifference,
intentional
neglect.
federal
courts
--
i
understand
the
fifth
circuit’s
position
to
be
essentially
that
well
somebody
has
got
to
help
this
poor
guy.
in
the
first
place,
he
was
not
a
poor
guy
he
was
treated
by
at
least
two
doctors
on
at
least
eight
different
occasions.
they
responded
very
quickly.
the
day
he
was
injured,
he
worked
four
more
hours.
he
requested
a
hospital
pass.
they
gave
him
one
immediately.
they
did
not
make
him
work
any
longer.
he
went
to
the
hospital,
he
was
checked
for
a
hernia,
he
was
sent
to
his
cell.
an
hour
later,
he
felt
pain
again,
he
did
not
feel
good,
he
came
back,
they
let
him
go
back,
he
saw
a
doctor
that
very
day.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
your
honor,
in
this
class
action
lawsuit
by
a
number
of
prisoners,
which
we
have
pending.
we
have
two
to
three
of
them
in
which
the
justice
department
is
involved
to
extensive
discovery
that
would
be
relevant,
and
it
would
be
tried
at
the
district
court
level.
in
this
case,
we
failed
to
see
how
a
general
shortage
of
doctors
in
the
texas
department
of
correction
is
relevant
in
anyway
when
he
sees
two
doctors
on
a
number
of
occasions.
they
see
him
time
after
time,
they
give
a
prescription
--
dr.
astone
gives
a
prescription
as
if
the
first
day
after
he
is
injured.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
no
your
honor
that
was
in
the
appendix
submitted
by
respondent,
the
appendix,
a
brief
submitted
by
respondent
to
the
fifth
circuit.
it
was
a
citizens
advisory
report
to
a
committee.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
he
does.
he
not
only
went
to
see
dr.
gray,
he
saw
dr.
astone
five
different
times.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
it
is
in
his
compliant.
he
states
he
saw
dr.
astone.
the
interesting
thing
about
this
whole
complaint
is
that
there
was
never
any
time
when
there
was
any
substantial
weight
when
he
requested
medical
care.
he
saw
dr.
astone,
he
saw
doctor
the
very
day
he
was
injured.
he
saw
dr.
astone
on
the
next
day;
he
was
“examined”
by
dr.
astone.
he
stated
that
dr.
astone’s
medical
record
reflected
he
had
a
back
strain,
and
dr.
astone
prescribed
bed
rest
and
pain
pills
for
two
days.
three
days
later,
he
sees
dr.
astone
again.
dr.
astone
prescribes
bed
rest
and
pain
pills
for
seven
days.
seven
days
later
he
sees
dr.
astone
again.
that
sequence
of
the
time
between
visitations
and
the
time
for
prescriptions
continues
throughout
this
complaint.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
dr.
gray
i
know
the
people
who
worked
on
the
prison
reform
committee,
and
they
have
all
the
respect
in
the
world
for
dr.
gray.
he
is
the
medical
director
of
tdc;
he
is
the
chief
medical
officer
at
prison
(voice

pluymen
no,
sir,
captain
blunt
would
not
be
a
doctor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
in
general
way,
if
we
are
going
to
talk
about
--
here
is
the
reports
and
everything.
in
general,
the
medical
captains
are
people
who
come
out
of
the
army
and
were
medics
and
have
tried
and
they
are
utilized
by
tdc
on
--
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
claim
under
the
constitution
of
united
states
was
stated
with
the
kind
of
medical
care
that
this
person
alleges,
petitioners
just
failed
to
see
how
it
is
anyway
possible
to
conclude
that
the
claim
was
stated.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
our
position
is
that
if
there
were
300
doctors
in
tdc,
and
he
saw
none,
how
is
it
relevant
that
there
were
300
doctors
there.
they
alleged
that
there
were
two
or
three
fulltime
doctors.
now,
he
saw
two
and
he
did
not
just
see
them
once,
he
saw
them
on
numerous
occasions,
and
he
saw
them
practically,
immediately
after
he
complained.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
understand.
well,
in
petitioner’s
statement
of
facts
we
set
out
something,
in
respondent’s
statement
of
facts
some
other
parts
of
it
are
set
out,
neither
is
complete.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
it
is
in
the
complaint.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor,
it
is
completely
irrelevant.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
the
point,
eighth
court
of
civil
appeals
has
dealt
with.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
the
position.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
think
we
can
probably
have
it
typed
up
your
honor
verbatim.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
we
can
do
that.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
it
is
a
summary
and
an
interpretation.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
it
is
not
a
verbatim
transcript.
the
original
record
contains
the
complaint,
and
it
is
a
legal
sized
paper,
his
writing
as
fairly
big
although,
and
it
is
not
typewritten
and
so
it
is
hard
to
read.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
do
you
think
the
standard
for
reviewing
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
should
be
the
same
or
different
when
there
has
been
no
response,
no
motion,
no
nothing
by
the
state?
our
position
is
it
should
be
exactly
the
same.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
correct.
although
i
could
not
predict
like
your
honor
said
exactly
what
the
state
would
have
done,
if
i
had
to
handle
this
case
i
would
have
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
failure
to
state
a
claim.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
no
there
is
not
your
honor.
i
doubt
that
by
answering
the
state
could
somehow
salvage
the
complaint.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
is
true
your
honor.
the
court
would
consider
all
of
the
cases
decided
by
the
circuit
courts.
we
would
submit
that
on
the
facts
there
is
no
case
that
we
have
any
substantial
disagreement
with
as
far
as
granting
or
dismissing
a
complaint.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
i
understand
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
no
you
do
not.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
no,
you
have
not
your
honor.
i
was
just
citing
the
eighth
court
of
appeals
because
there
are
quite
a
number
of
judges
and
other
collective
wisdom
in
--
the
facts
that
those
cases
when
you
compare
them
with
the
facts
of
this
case
and
every
case
where
they
granted
relief
or
permitted
a
complaint
to
be
filed
over
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
facts
of
those
cases
were
completely
different.
they
were
a
total
completely
different
nature
than
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
and
the
court
says
it
at
one
point,
another
point
the
court
says
it
was
a
total
refusal
to
treatment
which
--
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
that
sounds
like.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
we
have
asserted
that
all
the
way
through
this
case,
we
asserted
in
the
brief
and
cite
numerous
cases
in
support
of
it.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
your
honor,
the
apparent
from
our
arguments
today
and
more
apparent
from
the
two
briefs
that
counsel
and
i
had
no
disagreement,
this
is
the
law
to
be
applied.
i
have
no
disagreement
with
the
deliberate
indifference
test,
and
the
court
should
decide
to
use
that
test
under
constitutional
standards.
the
only
disagreement
that
we
have
comes
to
the
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts.
the
deliberate
indifference,
particular
occurrences
cited
by
counsel
in
his
brief
are
taken
completely
out
of
context.
the
failure
of
the
building
department
to
issue
him
a
lower
bunk
for
one
week
during
a
course
of
medical
treatment
by
dr.
astone
four
weeks
are
failed
to
see
how
that
stands
out.
his
medical
prescription
for
30
days
given
by
dr.
gray
which
was
lost
for
four
and
then
given
to
him,
i
fail
to
see
how
that
alleges
any
constitutional
claim.
he
is
being
threatened
by
a
lieutenant
and
a
sergeant
60
days
after
he
was
injured,
and
he
was
asked
do
you
want
to
go
to
work,
he
said
no,
and
they
threatened
to
send
him
to
the
“farm”.
that
was
some
34
days
after
dr.
astone
had
ordered
him
to
do
light
work,
and
he
had
refused
to
do
it.
he
was
taken
before
a
disciplinary
committee
twice.
the
first
time
after
having
been
cured
for
by
dr.
astone
for
three
weeks
he
said
i
still
heard
dr.
astone
has
had
me
for
26
days
under
his
cure,
he
did
not
even
notice
my
high
blood
pressure.
the
disciplinary
committee
did
not
say
go
to
work
or
we
are
sending
you
to
solitary.
they
said
we
are
going
to
send
you
to
see
another
doctor.
the
very
next
day
he
saw
dr.
gray.
he
remained
under
dr.
gray’s
care
for
two
weeks
after
that.
it
was
not
until
86
days
or
40
days
after
that
first
disciplinary
committee
hearing;
86
days
after
the
injury
that
he
was
taken
before
disciplinary
committee
the
second
time
and
that
is
when
he
was
sent
to
solitary
for
refusing
to
work.
it
had
been
a
long
time;
he
had
been
doctor’s
care
twice.
doctor
already
ordered
him
to
do
light
work
months
before
he
had
refused
to
do
it
then,
they
finally
cracked
down
on
him,
and
sent
him
to
solitary.
so
there
is
really
no
deliberate
indifference
in
this
case
as
far
as
constitutional
standard
or
claim
is
concerned.
bishop
v.
stoneman
which
is
cited
by
counsel
as
the
best
evidence
or
the
best
example
of
deliberate
indifference.
the
allegations
contained
in
that
case
are
horrendous,
back
injury,
request
to
see
a
doctor
-
it
took
six
months,
people
vomiting
blood,
not
seeing
doctors
for
seven,
eight
days
after
that.
the
facts
are
just
--
it
is
not
only
difference
in
degree
in
that
case,
but
in
kind.
if
your
honors
were
serious
about
us
typing
up
verbatim
transcript
to
this
complaint
since
we
agree
on
the
law
your
honors
can
determine
for
yourselves.
the
application
of
all
the
facts,
there
is
no
sense
in
us
arguing
over.
mr.
bert
w.
pluymen
as
far
as
the
medical
record
is
concerned
should
the
court
call
up
the
medical
record
in
every
case.
our
office
will
submit
the
medical
record
generally
to
the
court
along
with
a
motion
dismissed
or
whatever
planning
for
the
benefit
of
the
court.
in
this
particular
case,
what
difference
does
it
make
in
terms
of
whether
he
stated
a
complaint
or
not?
upon
reading
the
complaint
he
named
the
analgesics,
robaxin,
febuverine,
sodium
salicylate,
the
ekg.
i
spent
two
days
in
a
county
medical
library
trying
to
figure
out
the
terminology
that
he
states
in
his
complaint.
he
obviously
copied
it.
we
do
not
even
have
to
assume
that
he
copied
it
out
on
his
own
medical
record,
but
taking
a
look
that
the
court
called
up
the
medical
record
what
difference
would
it
make.
