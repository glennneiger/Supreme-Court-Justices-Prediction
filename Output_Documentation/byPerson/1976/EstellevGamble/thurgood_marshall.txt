justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
have
to
complain.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
you
represent
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
do
not
have
a
complaint
that
the
petitioner
was
not
served;
the
petitioner
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
think
that
that
case
deals
with
attorney
that
represent
mr.
estelle?
the
one
i
have
seen
it
turns
out
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
this
appendix
page
10
and
11?
isn't
that
petitionerâ€™s,
i
mean
respondent,
isn't
that
his
writing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says,
he
went
to
dr.
ralph
gray,
medical
director
of
the
texas
department
of
correction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says
himself
that
he
had
medical
treatment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
in
his
complaint?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
this
a
medical
doctor?
we
do
not
know,
because
you
know
in
prisons
the
word
'doctor'
does
not
mean
a
medical
doctor.
it
means
that
callman
handing
out
pills,
they
call
him
doc.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
about
the
prison
(voice
overlap)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
captain
somebody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
a
doctor
is
a
captain?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
thought,
because
this
captain
is
a
guard.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
hedges
as
i
understand
you
that
every
time
a
prison
guard
denies
a
man
a
right
to
sick
call,
it
is
a
1983
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
perhaps
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
did
not
think
you
could.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
i
mean,
the
guy
every
morning
says
i
would
rather
have
sick
call
than
go
to
work,
he
never
would
go
to
work
or
he
would
have
365,
1983
a
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
think
this
complain
shows
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
start
over
with
a
very
great
difficulty
of
a
man
that
has
a
600
pound
bale
for
long
that
he
cannot
move.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
rather
impossible,
the
man
that
has
600
pound
weight
for
along
with
and
to
work
four
more
hours
before
he
gets
a
pay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
once
you
have
worked
the
lead
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
did
not
fail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
read
this
appendix,
the
magistrate
ruled
that
it
could
not
be
filed,
or
these
are
not
permitted
to
be
filed
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
says
i
permit
it
to
be
filed,
isn't
that
what
he
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
allowed
it
to
be
filed
in
forma
pauperis.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
not
what
i
asked.
is
this
that
allowed
it
to
be
filed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
get
back
to
what
we
raised
in
attorney
general,
was
mr.
estelle
served?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
complain
about
the
state
not
filing
something
while
they
did
not
know
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
case
arose
when
gamble,
a
prisoner
in
the
texas
department
of
correction
has
filed
a
civil
rights
action
under
42
u.s.
code
1983
against
the
prison
doctor,
the
prison
warden,
and
the
director
of
the
department
of
corrections.
he
claimed
that
he
was
subjected
to
cruelty
and
unusual
punishment
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
the
prison's
treatment
of
a
back
injury
he
sustained
during
prison
work.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
from
failure
to
state
the
cause
of
action
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
ordered
the
claim
reinstated.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
spelled
out
the
guidelines
for
such
complaints
and
we
hold
that
in
this
case
as
in
others,
the
eighth
amendment's
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
requires
a
prison
be
provided
with
medical
care
and
that
deliberative
deliverance
by
prison
personnel
to
a
prisoner
with
such
illness
or
injury
violates
the
eighth
amendment.
in
the
present
case
however,
we
find
no
such
indifference
by
one
of
the
petitioners,
the
doctor
dr.
gray.
and
according
to
his
complaint,
the
prisoner
in
this
case
saw
dr.
gray
and
other
medical
personnel
on
at
least
17
different
occasions
at
which
time
he
was
given
medicine
and
otherwise
treated
with
back
injury,
as
well
as
his
other
ailments.
accordingly,
the
complaint
against
the
doctor
was
properly
dismissed
by
the
district
court.
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
whether
gamble
was
--
has
stated
a
constitutional
claim
against
the
other
petitioners,
the
director
of
the
department
of
corrections
and
the
warden
of
the
prison,
these
were
not
separately
evaluated
by
the
court.
and
for
that
reason,
the
case
is
remanded
for
the
consideration
of
these
other
questions.
mr.
justice
blackmun
concurred
from
the
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
