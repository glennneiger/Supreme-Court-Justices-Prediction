justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
brief
i
believe
indicates
that
because
of
changes
in
creation
of
administrative
procedures
as
kind
of
a
problem
will
tend
to
go
away
in
the
future,
is
that
so?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
not
question
or
do
you
question
his
outline
of
the
administrative
procedures
that
have
now
been
established
to
deal
with
these
problems.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
decide
that
this
court
should
decide
that
administrative
remedies
have
to
be
exhausted
and
utilized
first,
to
what
extent
do
you
think
that
would
solve
this
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
that
physician’s
claim
of
privilege
in
this
sort
of
action
or
defense
be
any
different
by
virtue
of
that
he
was
employed
by
the
state
of
texas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
physician
would
be
liable
on
the
fact
then
that
liability
is
assumed
by
the
state
assembly
is
not
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
there
is
no
hint
in
the
federal
rules
as
civil
procedure
that
the
standard
is
any
different
when
the
state
has
responded
by
way
of
a
one
line
motion
to
dismiss
or
by
some
other
pleadings
when
the
question
of
sufficiency
of
a
claim
to
state
a
claim
is
the
complaint
to
state
a
claim
is
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
conceivably
if
the
state
answers,
and
then
there
is
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
rely
on
the
state’s
admissions
and
the
answer
is
well
as
on
the
plaintiff’s
complaint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
what
we
usually
take,
our
law
firm
take
a
consensus
the
courts
of
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
never
even
held
a
total
absence
of
medical
care
raises
the
constitutional
question,
have
we?
