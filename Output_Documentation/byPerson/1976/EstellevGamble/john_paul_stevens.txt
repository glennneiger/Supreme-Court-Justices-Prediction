justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general
while
you
are
interrupted,
would
you
help
me
on
the
procedure
here
that
complaint
was
filed
as
i
read
the
record
in
february
and
the
magistrate
made
a
recommendation
in
june,
and
then
the
district
judge
dismissed
the
complaint.
what
happened
between
february
and
june
as
to
why
the
state
did
not
file
a
motion
of
any
kind
or
an
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
practice
in
this
district
in
texas?
does
the
complaint
just
get
filed
or
is
it
somehow
or
other
screen
by
a
magistrate
for
leave
to
file
in
someway?
it
was
a
little
puzzling
to
me
at
that
time
to
figure
out
what
happened.
is
there
any
automatic
provision
in
the
rules
down
there
for
you
to
be
served
when
something
is
filed
against
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
what
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
supposing
they
find
no
merit
then
do
they
deny
lead
to
file
or
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
all
done
in
advance
of
any
service
or
notice
to
the
defendants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
not
a
sport.
i
mean
this
is
the
way
it
is
done
frequently
in
this
district,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
i
raised
that
this
practice
has
been
followed
in
the
seventh
circuit
was
challenged
at
one
time
just
wondering
if
it
was
challenged
in
that
district.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
magistrate
seems
to
correspond
it
with
the
prisoner
without
corresponding
with
the
defendants.
i
was
asking
if
you
had
any
other
information,
but
he
did
not
ask
the
defendants
if
they
wanted
to
file
a
medical
records
anything
like
that,
which
is,
it
seems
a
little
bit
unusual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
not
being
critical
i
am
just
trying
to
discover
what
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
was
the
1983
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
i
do
not
mean
to
labor
the
point,
but
you
assumed
that
mr.
estelle
was
served.
i
wonder
if
that
is
a
valid
assumption,
because
in
forma
pauperis
complaint
i
assume
the
marshall
would
not
go
out
with
the
summons
unless
he
got
his
fees,
and
the
recommendation
that
he
would
be
given
permission
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
by
the
magistrate
is
in
the
same
order
in
which
he
recommended
that
the
proceeding
be
dismissed,
which
may
explain
why
your
clients
never
heard
of
the
case
until
it
was
on
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
am
just
wondering
if
they
are
following
rule
4
thereof
automatically
issuing
summons
or
what
they
do,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
at
this
--
as
i
read
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
as
a
pleading
case,
and
here
we
are
arguing
the
substance
and
lot
of
facts
and
all
and
i
was
wondering
why
there
was
nothing
at
all
filed
by
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
that
maybe
significant,
but
the
answer
is
you
did
not
know
about
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would,
but
perhaps
you
would
have
filed
a
medical
record,
you
might
have
had
a
different
record
before
us
and
instead
of
just
having
prisoner
allegation
we
do
not
know
what
you
would
have
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
might
have
investigated
and
find
well
there
is
something
here.
we
do
not
have
any
way
of
knowing
what
you
would
have
done,
had
you
been
served
in
the
normal
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
general
i
ask
one
other
question.
we
first
are
dealing
with
the
fact,
but
under
conley
against
gibson
i
guess
it
tested
the
sufficiency
whether
under
any
state
of
facts
which
can
be
conceived,
there
might
be
a
valid
claim
proved
reverse
to
that
affect.
then
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
adopt
it
in
even
more
liberal
standard.
at
page
31,
they
say
that
a
situation
calls
for
even
greater
liberality
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
where
the
state
has
not
been
required
to
file
any
pleading
whatsoever
and
that
was
the
point
we
are
talking
about
earlier.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
disagree
with
the
analysis
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
point
as
well
as
on
the
test
what
section
1983
requires.
