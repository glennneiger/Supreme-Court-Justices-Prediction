mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
daniel
hedges,
counsel
for
the
respondent
j.
w.
gamble.
the
respondent
would
like
to
make
just
three
basic
points
before
the
court
today.
the
first
of
those
is
that
a
pro
se
petition
by
an
illiterate
prisoner
alleging
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
right
to
medical
care
should
never
be
dismissed
without
requiring
a
responsive
pleading
or
at
least
examining
the
relevant
medical
records.
second,
that
a
petition
which
sets
forth
a
pattern
of
conduct,
which
establishes
deliberate
indifference
by
prison
officials
to
the
rights
of
prisoners
to
adequate
medical
care
or
to
medical
care
at
all,
states
a
cause
of
action.
and
third,
during
from
the
procedural
point
to
the
substantive
point
that
the
complaint
itself,
under
whatever
standard,
the
court
chooses
to
apply
mr.
gamble’s
complaint
does
state
a
cause
of
action.
in
reference
to
the
question
by
mr.
justice
white
just
a
few
moments
ago
in
the
opening
pages
of
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
they
state,
we
find
the
complaint
sufficient
in
alleging
that
the
action
of
the
authorities
was
tantamount
to
a
refusal
of
medical
treatment.
later
on,
in
the
opinion
they
do
state
it
was
inadequate.
i
would
probably
find
myself
an
agreement
with
my
colleague
from
the
attorney
general’s
office
that
is
not
entirely
certain
just
which
of
the
standards
of
the
fifth
circuit
did
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
he
saw
doctors
your
honor,
but
we
would
certainly
say
that
we
can
argue
that
there
was
a
refusal
of
medical
care.
i
had
cited
the
court
to
an
example
from
the
fifth
circuit
case
robinson
versus
jordan
where
the
individual
was
complaining
of
severe
rectal
pain,
saw
doctors
on
several
occasions,
the
doctors
prescribed
suppositories
of
some
sort
to
treat
this
person’s
pain.
the
pain
persisted.
he
continued
to
complain,
they
would
not
do
x-rays,
they
would
not
do
further
tests,
and
they
would
not
change
the
prescription.
months
later,
the
person
finally
got
another
examination.
he
had
advanced
rectal
cancer,
and
have
a
colostomy
that
person
stated
a
claim.
i
would
say
that
if
a
diagnosis
is
conducted,
treatment
is
prescribed
in
accordance
with
that
diagnosis,
but
the
symptoms
persist.
there
is
certainly
a
medical
possibility
that
the
diagnosis
was
wrong,
in
refusal
to
conduct
to
subsequent
diagnosis,
and
if
necessary
change
the
treatment.
you
are
not
really
talking
about
just
disagreement
with
the
diagnosis;
you
are
talking
about
a
refusal
to
conduct
a
subsequent
diagnosis
in
the
phase
of
persisting
symptoms.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
i
think
if
they
are
--
if
it
is
clear
to
them
that
the
care
which
they
were
providing
was
having
no
affect
whatsoever
than
the
logical
conclusion
would
be
that
their
diagnosis
was
wrong,
but
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
that
was
a
1983
case.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
it
is
very
similar,
and
we
do
not
need
to
rely
on
that
in
this
case,
and
i
hate
to
spend
my
time
before
the
court
dealing
with
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
it
is
definitely
different
from
the
total
absence
of
medical
care.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
yes,
they
are.
we
feel
that
we
can
come
under
the
total
refusal
test
as
well
for
circumstance
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
certain
other
allegations
in
the
complaint,
in
which
on
certain
occasions,
overall
on
certain
occasions,
this
individual
suffered
from
the
deliberate
indifference
of
prison
authorities
to
his
medical
need.
this
is
the
standard
we
would
urge
before
the
court
today,
and
not
the
total
refusal
standard.
this
standard
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
explained
in
some
detail.
this
is
the
standard
we
would
set
forth
before
the
court
and
urge
if
that
an
allegation
of
deliberate
indifference
by
prison
authorities
to
the
medical
needs
of
a
prisoner
states
a
claim,
this
test
has
several
advantages,
one
of
them
being
you
are
not
looking
at
medical
care.
you
are
not
disagreeing
with
doctors,
you
are
looking
at
the
actions
of
the
prison
authorities,
and
i
have
cited
nine
examples
in
the
brief
for
the
prison
authorities
denied
adequate
medical
care
to
this
individual
on
administrative
basis.
i
would
like
to
just
bring
back
to
the
court
three
of
those,
which
we
have,
a
very
good
example
of
what
i
am
talking
about
here.
mr.
pluymen
pointed
out
this
individual
was
never
refused
the
opportunity
to
go
to
see
a
doctor
or
seek
some
sort
of
medical
personnel
when
he
was
in
pain,
this
is
incorrect.
on
february
7th
and
8th
1974,
when
he
was
in
solitary
confinement,
he
asked
to
go
on
sick
call.
he
was
refused
permission
to
go
on
sick
call
by
prison
guards
not
by
medical
authorities,
but
by
administrative
individuals
by
prison
guards.
the
law
enforcement
assistants
association,
branch
of
the
justice
department
has
stated
in
one
of
its
recent
reports
that
denial
to
access
to
sick
call
is
an
open
invitation
to
inmates
to
sue
the
institution
for
its
prima
facie
evidence
of
denial
of
medical
care.
he
also
had
a
prescription
from
one
of
the
doctors
that
he
did
see
that
he
received
a
lower
bunk,
the
man
had
lower
back
injury,
they
prescribed
a
lower
bunk;
he
never
got
one.
once
again,
an
administrative
decision
by
the
prison
authority
not
disagreeing
it
is
a
diagnosis,
not
disagreeing
that
it
is
the
treatment.
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
is
absolutely
correct,
we
were
discussing
diagnosis,
and
we
were
discussing
treatment
a
minute
ago,
we
are
not
now.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
not
every
time
he
does
it
your
honor
but
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
the
standard
stated
in
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
you
cannot
put
a
number
on
it
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
you
cannot
your
honor
but
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
standard
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
some
of
the
prisoners
apparently
come
pretty
close
to
filing
that
many
your
honor,
i
realize
and
that
is
a
problem,
but
the
second
circuit
in
the
1974
decision
bishop
versus
stoneman
examined
the
full
accumulation
of
instance.
what
the
district
court
has
done
there
is
look
at
each
individual
incident
alleged
to
know
this
incident
by
itself
is
not
enough
and
they
dismissed.
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
remanded,
i
think,
look
at
the
accumulation
of
the
incidence,
and
if
from
that
accumulation
of
incidents
you
determine
a
series
of
incidents,
which
constitute
a
pattern
of
conduct
demanding
to
deliberate
indifference
to
the
medical
needs
of
prisoners
then
you
have
a
claim.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
i
do
indeed
your
honor.
there
are
nine
separate
instances
where
this
individual
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
that
is
very
difficult
to
understand
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
i
think
what
happened
with
the
pound
that
bale
--
we
were
in
such
a
difficulty
here
your
honor;
it
is
hard
to
tell
just
what
happened.
it
is
hard
to
tell
a
600
pound
bale
fell
on
him
or
he
was
trying
to
pick
up
one
to
fail
and
strained
his
back.
your
honor,
it
is
impossible
to
tell.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
it
is
very
hard
to
understand.
it
is
also
impossible
to
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
if
that
is
what
he
was
trying
to
say
it
is
hard
to
understand
what
he
was
trying
to
say
your
honor
that
a
600
pound
bale
fell
on
him,
that
would
be
hard
to
believe.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
if
indeed
a
600
pound
bale
fell
on
him
that
would
be
hard
to
believe.
he
said
the
bale
fell
flat.
but
your
honor
i
think
we
are
getting
problem,
we
start
trying
to
delve
into
just
what
this
person
said
here.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
what
is
he
trying
to
say
rather
than
do
we
believe
him
or
do
we
not
believe
him.
it
is
unclear
from
this
petition
getting
back
to
man’s
complaint.
you
cannot
tell
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
a
diagnosis
here.
the
court
is
asking
was
it
there
diagnosis
of
lower
back
strain.
all
it
says
in
the
complaint
is
and
once
like
this
is
dr.
astone
record
show
plaintiff
had
lower
back
strain,
in
another
place
as
dr.
gray,
record
show
plaintiff
had
lower
back
strain.
in
the
same
hospital
two
different
doctors
do
not
have
their
own
records,
the
patient
has
the
records,
and
it
is
impossible
to
tell
from
the
complaint;
who
made
that
entry
in
the
record?
was
it
even
a
doctor
at
all,
or
was
it
one
of
these
inmate
nurses?
we
get
back
to
the
questions
that
the
court
asked
at
the
very
outset,
those
go
to
this
procedural
point.
without
the
medical
records
themselves,
without
ever
having
seen
the
medical
records
it
is
really
impossible
to
tell
just
what
did
happen
to
this
individual,
just
what
cure
was
received.
we
have
a
great
danger
when
we
allow
the
district
courts
to
dismiss
these
cases,
which
are
so
very
difficult
to
interpret
and
in
fact
difficult
to
believe
admittedly,
and
there
are
so
very
many
of
them,
but
when
we
allow
them
to
be
summarily
dismissed
without
a
response
and
pleading
and
without
any
discovery,
we
run
a
tremendous
risk
at
the
very
few
valid
cases
or
the
valid
cases
that
do
come
along
will
simply
be
thrown
out
with
the
invalid
ones
because
there
are
just
too
many
cases
to
consider
and
consider
carefully.
what
should
be
done
here
is
that
the
state
or
the
defendants
in
this
case
mr.
estelle,
mr.
gray
and
mr.
husbands
should
be
required
to
assist
to
the
court.
this
is
not
a
question
of
whether
federal
courts
will
sit
as
medical
review
boards.
the
question
in
this
case
before
the
court
is,
should
the
defendants
be
required
to
play
their
role
in
the
litigation
of
helping
the
courts
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
a
valid
claim,
and
the
tools
are
there
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures,
summary
judgment
with
affidavits
a
12(b)(6)
motion
with
the
medical
record
simply
attached.
none
of
this
was
done
in
this
case.
another
solution
which
is
there
which
was
discussed
earlier
is
the
administrative
grievance
procedures.
those
are
there
in
the
texas
courts
now.
in
the
federal
courts,
in
the
experimental
project
--
i
am
sorry
in
the
texas
department
of
corrections,
right.
those
administrative
procedures
are
now
available
in
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons,
35%
of
their
complaints
received
favorable
action.
those
are
complaints
which
never
had
to
go
to
court
because
they
received
favorable
action
in
the
prisons,
within
the
grievance
procedures
and
furthermore
those
which
do
go
for
these
grievance
procedures,
and
then
get
into
the
courts
are
going
to
have
documentation
attached;
they
are
going
to
have
a
record
attached.
it
is
not
going
to
be
like
the
case
here.
so
there
is
no
excuse
for
the
district
courts
dismissing
these
cases
without
requiring
some
sort
of
response
in
pleading
or
some
sort
of
discovery.
it
is
very
dangerous
in
a
few
good
cases,
a
few
valid
cases,
will
be
thrown
out
because
of
the
great
flood
of
litigation
and
furthermore
there
are
other
procedures
available.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
it
was
filed
and
an
immediate
dismissal
recommend
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
permission
to
file
in
forma
pauperis
be
granted.
the
clerk
be
required
to
file
the
petition.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
in
forma
pauperis,
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
i
do
not
know
under
any
provision
of
which
he
could
deny
the
permission
to
file
it
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
there
is
no
summons
or
vindication
whatsoever
of
service
in
the
record
your
honor
therefore
on
the
record
we
have
to
assume
he
was
not.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
the
blame
does
not
lie
with
the
state
there
your
honor,
the
blame
lies
with
the
district
court
and
the
magistrate
were
not
requiring
that
the
state
be
served
in
(inaudible)
and
wherever
the
blame
was
and
the
end
result
is
that
the
district
court
did
dismiss
a
petition
without
any
response
and
pleading
your
honor.
the
effect
on
my
client
is
the
same
whichever
place
it
started
out.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
he
could
do
it.
i
think
it
should
not
be
granted
your
honor
unless
--
all
he
would
have
to
do
is
to
attach
a
xerox
copy
of
the
medical
records
in
his
affidavits
from
the
doctor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
i
think
for
a
pro
se
petition
and
a
1983
action
such
as
the
one
here,
the
courts
should
not
dismiss
these
cases
without
at
least
looking
at
the
medical
records
and
requiring
some
response
and
pleading.
it
is
not
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
your
honor,
it
is
absolutely
correct
that
this
is
the
position
that
several
of
the
circuits
have
taken,
and
i
would
urge
before
this
court
that
it
is
a
very
sound
position
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
already
stated.
i
would
like
to
move
on
very
briefly
from
the
questions
of
procedure
to
the
questions
of
what
is
a
proper
standard
once
a
district
court
has
one
of
these
petitions
for
reviewing
it.
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
the
standard
which
i
have
already
touched
upon
that
deliberate
indifference
by
prison
officials
to
the
medical
needs
of
prisoners,
allegations
of
this
state
a
claim
under
1983,
before
that
test
it
is
really
essential
that
the
court
keep
in
mind
that
whatever
test
the
attorney
general's
office
advocate
and
they
advocate
this
exceptional
circumstances
test.
whatever
test
i
advocate,
the
improper
test
was
used
in
the
present
case,
and
that
was
the
so-called
prison
deference
rule
or
hands-off
doctrine.
this
is
at
the
district
court
level.
the
magistrate
used
this
test
and
this
is
one
which
you
simply
think
we
are
going
to
interfere
with
the
decision
of
prison
officials,
which
is
probably
inadequate
test
it
matters
with
administration
of
prisons,
it
matters
with
discipline,
but
the
circuits
uniformly
held
this
is
a
totally
inappropriate
test
when
you
are
talking
about
the
medical
needs
of
prisoners
the
constitutional
rights
of
prisoners.
the
proper
test
is
that
a
deliberate
indifference
and
i
have
already
dealt
with
the
case,
which
best
exemplifies,
bishop
versus
stoneman
which
the
court
looked
at
all
of
the
circumstances
involved.
as
the
second
circuit
says
that
based
on
this
accumulation
of
instance
we
see
a
pattern
of
conduct
here,
which
indicates
a
deliberate
indifference
to
the
needs
to
prisoners.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
whereas
you
might
not
have
to
in
one
case,
your
honor
you
might
have
it
the
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
well,
in
this
case
your
honor
i
would
urge
that
the
court
look
at
the
actions
of
the
non-medical
prison
personnel,
nine
separate
instances,
which
i
have
set
out
in
brief,
in
three
of
which
i
discussed
with
the
court
just
a
minute
ago
and
i
think
you
will
find
that
those
completely
aside
from
diagnosis
and
completely
aside
from
treatment.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
your
honor
i
think
i
discussed
that
somewhat
in
my
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
stewart
a
little
while
ago
that
you
have
the
situation
you
likely
did
in
robinson
versus
jordan
if
you
are
going
to
look
at
that,
of
course
one
of
the
initial
quetions
is
are
you
going
to
look
at
it
at
all.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
it
would
be
one
of
the
factors
you
would
look
at.
it
would
not
be
the
sole
factor,
and
probably
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
the
medical
treatment
would
be
or
denial
of
medical
treatment
would
be
one
aspect
of
this,
and
when
you
look
at
a
deliberate
indifference
standard
--
if
you
are
talking,
and
you
can
establish
deliberate
indifference
to
the
needs
of
all
of
the
prisoners
in
the
prison
system,
this
of
course
is
relevant
to
an
allegation
of
deliberate
indifference
to
the
needs
of
one
of
the
prisoners
in
the
prison
system,
and
the
fact
that
at
many
times
there
is
one
doctor
available
to
17,000
prisoners
is
relevant
to
the
care
afforded
or
the
interest
and
the
needs
in
the
situation
of
one
of
those
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
i
do
not
think,
i
think
that
would
be
going
be
going
too
far.
i
think
you
need
to
look
at
the
adequacy
of
his
treatment
certainly.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
it
would
certainly
be
more
relevant
in
the
class
action
your
honor,
but
it
would
not
be
totally
irrelevant
in
the
case
such
as
this,
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
on
this
point
that
in
their
brief
the
attorney
general’s
office
does
not
allege
if
there
was
any
real
prejudice
or
that
the
outcome
of
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit
was
in
anyway
influenced
substantially
by
their
reference
to
this
appendix.
therefore,
this
is
not
a
matter
that
the
court
should
even
really
consider
and
furthermore
it
was
clearly
a
proper
matter
for
judicial
notice
since
it
was
the
report
of
a
working
paper,
which
ended
up
being
a
report
from
a
legislative
committee.
so
it
was
perfectly
proper
for
them
to
consider
it,
it
was
relevant
to
the
medical
care.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
no,
i
have
not
your
honor.
i
have
concurred
with
the
attorney
general
on
that.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
well,
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
arguing
this
case
in
this
fashion.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
states,
that
does
not
state
a
claim.
as
the
attorney
general
has
pointed
out
there
are
other
remedies
available,
they
are
short
of
relying
on
your
constitutional
remedies,
you
simply
got
the
texas
tort
claims
act
available,
and
several
other
remedies.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
yes
sir
it
is
right.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
yes
it
is
your
honor
and
that
would
be
the
solution
from
your
negligence.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
more
than
mere
negligence,
but
grows
indifference
to
the
needs
that
this
individual,
just
an
insistence
on
completely
ignoring
him
on
several
occasions.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
if
there
is
a
pattern
of
such
conduct
against
such
an
individual,
yes
your
honor
that
is
exactly
what
we
would
argue.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
yes,
your
honor,
we
argue
that
the
delivered
indifference
against
this
individual
does
amount
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
yeah,
there
is
not.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
there
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
there
is
not.
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
standards,
what
we
are
dealing
with
--
i
have
talked
about
the
procedural
problems,
i
think
the
court
delved
into
them
very
closely,
at
the
very
outset
with
their
questions
of
the
attorney
general
of
this.
we
have
never
seen
the
medical
records.
we
do
not
really
know
what
happened
in
this
petition,
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
read
and
simply
in
profit
of
relying
these
individuals
to
try
to
make
these
pleads,
we
have
looked
at
the
standard
of
care.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
more
thing
that
is
in
the
complaint,
one
more
instance
of
this
deliberate
indifference,
i
cited
one,
i
would
just
like
to
cite
one
more
to
the
court,
and
i
think
it
will
convey
to
the
court
somewhat
better
than
the
denial
of
sick
call,
what
deliberate
indifference
really
is.
on
january
31st
gamble
went
before
the
unit
disciplinary
committee
because
he
refused
to
go
to
work.
one
of
the
people
who
testified
at
that
disciplinary
committee
meeting
was
the
captain
blunt
who
he
had
seen
on
so
many
occasions
at
the
infirmary.
now,
three
weeks
previous
to
this
captain
blunt
had
prescribed
for
gamble
hypertension
medication
and
pain
medication.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
gamble
was
still
receiving
his
medication.
he
was
in
a
physical
condition,
which
require
hypertension
medicine
and
back
medicine.
blunt
testified
at
this
unit
disciplinary
committee
hearing
that
this
man
is
in
first
class
medical
condition.
first
class
medical
condition
means
this
man
can
go
out
in
fields
and
go
back
to
work
on
the
600
pound
bales
of
cotton
or
whatever
heavy
labor
there
is.
immediately
following
that
he
was
put
in
solitary
confinement,
there
was
no
medical
examination
of
him
before
he
was
put
into
solitary
confinement.
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
deliberate
indifference
by
prison
officials
to
the
medical
needs
of
this
individual.
to
briefly
summarize
this
is
a
case
where
the
wrong
procedure
was
used.
there
was
on
response
in
pleading
required,
the
medical
records
have
never
been
seen,
and
all
that
might
be
required
here
is
to
take
a
look
at
these
medical
records.
furthermore,
very
simple
streamlined
procedures
are
available
both
through
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
through
these
administrative
grievance
procedures
which
mr.
chief
justice
burger
has
called
for
in
his
1973
speech
on
the
state
of
judiciary,
in
which
mr.
justice
powell
has
touched
upon
in
his
pro-tenure
(ph)
decision.
texas
now
has
them.
it
is
too
late
for
mr.
gamble
to
utilize
them,
but
they
are
available
now,
and
this
court
should
not
be
seeing
any
more
cases
coming
out
of
texas
like
them.
mr.
gamble
simply
asked
to
be
a
court
of
the
same
right
that
other
prisoners
in
texas
now
have.
second,
the
standard
of
care,
whatever
the
court
decides
with
the
proper
standard,
the
wrong
standard
was
applied
here,
and
that
was
just
this
hands-off
doctrine.
we
just
would
not
interfere
with
the
prison
officials’
decisions,
and
third
completely
aside
from
questions
of
diagnosis
and
treatment
mr.
gamble’s
complaint
does
state
a
cause
of
action
in
case
of
deliberate
indifference
to
his
medical
needs
by
the
prison
administrative
officials.

daniel
k.

doctrine
judge
duhé
(ph).
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
your
honor
we
cannot
tell
from
this
case
whether
judge
duhé
(ph)
really
even
reviewed
the
magistrate’s
decision
or
not
the
lawrence
versus
wainwright
case,
which
is
the
hands-off
doctrine
case
as
in
the
magistrate’s
decision.
no
indication
whatsoever
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
independent
review
of
the
magistrate
by
judge.
the
all
judge
duhé
(ph)
says
this
we
adopt
the
recommendations
of
the
magistrate.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
so
that
was
the
standard,
which
was
not
--
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
that
is
correct.
he
deals
with
care
afforded
to
prisoners
in
the
harris
county
jails
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
it
is
not
and
must
not
have
been
a
response
your
honor.
there
was
no
response,
and
with
mail
being
a
way
it
is
so
in
my
efforts
to
communicate
with
my
prisoner
i
do
not
know
whether
he
received
that
request
or
not,
but
i
do
not
believe
there
was
a
response.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
it
is
not
in
the
record,
which
i
received
when
i
was
appointed
by
the
fifth
circuit
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
no,
it
is
impossible
to
tell
from
the
records
your
honor
what
degree
of
review
there
was.
if
there
was
a
great
danger,
it
is
helpful
to
utilize
the
magistrates,
but
as
the
court
is
very
well
aware
of
the
enormous
volume
of
these
cases.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
k.
hedges
that
simply
requested
that
if
he
vacated,
it
is
also
pro
se.
