unknown
speaker
some
procedure
requiring
the
grant
by
a
megistrate
to
leave
to
file
a
1983
complaint?
unknown
speaker
alright.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
--
this
was
a
handwritten
one,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
that
had
to
be
served
on
these
petitioners.
unknown
speaker
but
what
you
are
telling
is
whether
or
not
your
office
gets
to
defend
the
petitions,
depends
on
you
are
being
requested
to
represent
the
defendants?
unknown
speaker
you
have
never
heard
of
this
case
until
it
was
an
appeal?
unknown
speaker
who
represented
the
petitioners
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
and
that
when
the
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
you
first
heard
of
it?
unknown
speaker
and
does
your
office
always
represent
defendants
in
cases
like
this
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
least?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you
are
suggesting
is
perhaps
that
other
defendants
then
estelle
like
the
board
of
regions
or
other
people
who
might
be
partied
to
1983
--
unknown
speaker
--
under
texas
law,
might
have
other
counsel.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
if
the
court
of
appeals
just
took
it
as
if
there
had
been
a
motion
to
dismiss
file,
all
the
allegations,
the
complaint
were
taken
as
true
and
they
nonetheless
held
that
that
stated
the
claim
for
relief.
unknown
speaker
so
you
disagree
with
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
law?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
unknown
speaker
it
has
a
total
failure
to
provide
any
treatment
in
the
prison.
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
would
be
a
1983
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
but
what
do
you
understand
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
said
here,
this
negligent
treatment
is
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
the
conclusion,
you
agree
with
it?
unknown
speaker
the
states
then
withdraw
the
line
between
total
failure
and
just
an
ordinary
malpractice?
unknown
speaker
or
negligence.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
attorney,
what
if
these
fifth
circuit’s
opinion
said
the
rule
in
this
circuit
is
that
you
stated
1983
cause
of
action
when
there
has
been
a
total
failure
to
treat,
you
do
not
state
one
when
you
allege
only
a
negligent
failure,
and
we
construe
this
complaint
to
allege
a
total
failure.
now,
would
you
petition
for
cert
on
that
ground?
unknown
speaker
mr.
pluymen,
i
hope
at
page
31,
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
read
this
as
reading
general
medical
services
afforded
by
the
state
in
these
prisons
are
publicly
known
to
be
woefully
inadequate.
unknown
speaker
and
that
fall
short
of
what
you
think
would
be
the
basis
for
a
constitutional
plan?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
what
you
are
just
telling
is,
is
that
in
the
complaint?
unknown
speaker
that
must
be
the
one
referred
to
i
gather
the
footnote
was
--
unknown
speaker
actually
that
has
been
reported
as
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
way
of
an
appendix.
unknown
speaker
the
complaint
says
that
he
saw
them
on
numerous
occasions.
i
find
that
the
cite
on
this
is
very
difficult
to
gauge
for
me
at
my
age
with
my
eyes.
has
anybody
ever
tried
to
translate
this
and
place
there
something
for
it?
unknown
speaker
the
material
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
by
appendix
there
was
a
pleading
is
that
citizens
advisory
committee
of
report
is
not
that
--
not
the
sequence
of
treatment
which
is
the
sequence
of
treatment
is
in
the
complaint.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
i
take
it
is
that
even
if
the
medical
care
in
texas
prisons
generally
is
inadequate,
that
is
only
complaints
filed
here,
there
is
no
showing,
no
allegation
of
the
court
can
act
upon.
unknown
speaker
well
i
thought
also,
it
is
your
claim
or
as
a
legal
matter
that
an
allegation
of
inadequate
care
was
insufficient
to
state
a
claim
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act.
then
allegation
of
either
inadequate
care
or
negligent
care
was
insufficient
to
state
a
federal
claim,
was
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general
anyway
did
you
and
your
respondent
can
get
us
a
translation
of
that
you
agree
on?
unknown
speaker
that
you
both
agree
is
that
what
was
served.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
at
least
you
have
page
3
or
7
of
your
petition,
it
really
summarizes
each
allegation,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
an
interpretation
and
not
just
--
unknown
speaker
so
it
reduces
this
the
way
we
get
it,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
not
your
position
at
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
standard
of
law
in
deciding
whether
there
was
a
cause
of
action
stated,
because
the
court
says
that
the
treatment
was
inadequate?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
totally
failed
to
provide
adequate
treatment,
now
that
is
an
adequacy
standard,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
standard
i
think
that
you
assert
as
wrong.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
allegation
to
the
complaint
is
true.
it
is
obvious
you
cannot
conclude
that
there
was
a
total
failure
to
provide
treatment.
he
saw
a
doctor
and
a
doctor
did
some
things
for
him.
now,
you
can
say,
they
did
either
the
wrong
things
or
it
was
inadequate,
but
he
had
medical
care
of
some
kind.
unknown
speaker
that
is
an
assertion
that
the
doctors
refused
to
provide
care
that
they
knew
should
be
provided.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
actually
a
malpractice
claim,
isn't
it?
and
the
other
case
you
told
us
about
that
was
a
malpractice
claim.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
boils
down
to
as
a
malpractice
claim,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
quite
different
from
a
claim
of
a
total
failure
or
refusal
to
give
any
medical
care
whatsoever
to
somebody
in
accidents.
unknown
speaker
okay,
and
the
two
claims
are
different
not
under
gray,
but
in
kind,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
on
the
basis
of
the
man’s
own
complaint
he
saw
not
one,
but
two
doctors
and
saw
them
more
than
once.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
arguing
for
then
is
the
exception
to
the
normal
provisions
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
where
a
defendant
can
simply
come
in
and
file
a
one
sentence
motion
to
dismiss
and
argue
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint.
you
say
that
a
defendant
in
a
1983
action
is
not
able
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
supposing
he
does
not
attach
anything,
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
do
not
require
you
attach
anything
in
the
way
of
the
evidence
to
a
motion
to
dismiss.
are
you
saying
that
there
is
a
special
exception
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
a
defendant
in
a
1983
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
all
these
cases,
it
would
be
essential
in
a
case
such
as
this
for
the
court
to
come
to
some
judgment
as
to
how
gross
or
how
deviant
the
performance,
the
medical
personnel
was.
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
one
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
course
of
treatment,
and
come
to
some
conclusion
as
to
whether
the
doctors
were
indifferent
or
whether
they
were
merely
negligent
or
whether
their
treatment
was
adequate.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understand
the
suggestion
that
at
least
they
stand
it
out
to
be
deliberate
indifference
of
the
prison
officials
that
when
if
ever
do
we
get
into
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
medical
treatment
under
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
suggestion
would
--
looking
at
the
adequacy
of
the
medical
treatment
be
required?
unknown
speaker
but
the
basic
standard
would
be
deliberate
indifference
of
prison
officials
to
the
medical
needs
of
the
inmate.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
how
adequate
his
particular
treatment
of
a
particular
inmate
may
be.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
relevant
only
in
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hedges,
talking
about
the
standard
that
you
would
have
a
supply,
in
your
brief
you
state
that
allegations
and
mere
negligence
by
prison
medical
personnel
or
disagreement
as
to
the
diagnosis
do
not
constitute
action
of
proclaims
under
the
civil
rights
act,
have
you
changed
your
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
if
this
complaint
alleged
nearly
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
doctors
you
would
not
be
--
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
texas
tort
claims
act.
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
available
to
inmates
of
countries.
unknown
speaker
you
are
relying
on
averments
of
negligence
against
nine
medical
personnel.
unknown
speaker
do
you
argue
that
that
rises
to
the
level
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
unknown
speaker
under
the
facts
i
have
read
in
this
complaint?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
only
possible
federal
constitutional
claim
in
these
cases;
there
is
no
procedural
due
process
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
other
possible
procedural
claim?
unknown
speaker
the
feel
is
there.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hedges
is
it
really
fair
that
judge
duhé
(ph)
has
said
that
he
applied
the
hands-off
in
prison
matters
approach,
because
i
was
on
an
impression,
he
was
residing
in
some
major
piece
of
litigation
involving
a
review,
all
the
medical
records
within
the
texas
system.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
correct
or
am
i
misinformed?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
if
i
am
correct
in
believing,
he
does
have
some
major
case
pending
or
he
decided
something
involving
that.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
magistrate’s
report
states
that
he
requested
that
then
plaintiff
to
clarify,
and
particularize
the
allegations
and
depravations.
the
magistrate
then
goes
on
to
say
that
his
response
was
negative,
he
did
not
do
that.
is
that
a
response
in
the
appendix.
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
we
must
assume
that
he
did.
the
magistrate
says
his
response
did
not
do
so.
they
have
been
lost
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
i
was
also
puzzled
by
the
last
comment
you
made.
judge
duhé
(ph)
signed
a
final
judgment,
and
he
says
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
the
magistrate’s
memorandum.
are
you
suggesting
he
did
not
look
at
the
memorandum?
unknown
speaker
we
run
the
great
danger
of
the
courts
abdicating
their
responsibilities
to
the
magistrates,
and
letting
the
magistrates
make
these
recommendations,
i
have
no
indication
whatsoever
if
that
occurred
in
this
case.
we
said
you
cannot
assume
that
the
district
judge
did
not
do
his
duty.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hedges
one
other
question,
there
is
the
--
did
docket
entry
make
reference
to
a
motion
to
vacate
the
district
judge’s
order,
i
could
not
find
that.
do
you
know
if
there
was
in
the
nature
of
the
a
motion
for
a
leave
to
amend
the
complaint
or
for
--
unknown
speaker
and
no
additional
backed
allegation?
unknown
speaker
no,
there
were
not.
