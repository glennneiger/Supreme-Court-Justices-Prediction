well,
first,
i
would
say
that
we
are
bound
by
the
equality
requirements
that
i
have
mentioned
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
and
that
if
we
made
an
exception
in
the
abortion
case
because
abortions
happen
to
be
cheaper
than
full-term
delivery
services,
that
we
would
be
violating
those
very
provisions
of
the
act.
we
must
have
a
consistent
program
and
consistency
in
this
case,
is
medical
necessity.
