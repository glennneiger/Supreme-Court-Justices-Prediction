justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
by
hypothesis
though
these
people
have
gone
to
some
doctor,
have
they
not,
who
would
perform
an
abortion
on
them?
i
mean,
they
have
not
gone
to
a
midwife?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
not
the
gist
of
their
complaint
that
they
can
find
a
doctor
who
would
perform
an
abortion,
but
that
pennsylvania
would
not
pay
for
it
under
the
circumstances
that
they
are
performing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
arguing
the
constitutional
question
or
the
statutory
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
do
you
look
to
these
particular
interests
in
arguing
the
statutory
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
not
have
to
start
from
the
other
end
though
and
show
why
the
1965
act
of
congress
prevents
pennsylvania
from
doing
this
unless
it
can
show
these
interests
you
are
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
statute,
you
mean
the
pennsylvanian
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
that
last
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
allowing
mr.
crosby,
for
what
you
mean
really,
is
requiring
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
we
have
a
live
case
here?
how
about
the
particular
plaintiff
that
filed
this
action
in
the
district
court?
would
they
meet
the
pennsylvania
requirements
or
would
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
i
take
it
that
the
state
was
justified
on
the
terms
that
now
argued
in
contesting
the
temporary
restraining
order.
it
may
have
not
done
it
on
those
grounds,
but
certainly
it
was
justified
if
policy
would
have
been
as
now
announced
would
have
been
infringed
by
the
temporary
restraining
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
not
arguing
that
the
state
is
required
to
reimburse
for
every
abortion
on
demand?
is
that
what
your
argument
comes
down
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
watkins,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
liveness
of
the
controversy.
the
stipulation
you
refer
to
certainly
shows
you
have
a
controversy
between
lawyers
on
both
sides.
i
still
have
a
reservation
in
my
mind
as
whether
you
have
this
controversy
between
the
clients.
did
you
try
this
case
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
a
plaintiff
who
wanted
to
obtain
an
abortion
funded
with
federal
and
state
funds
affirmatively
state
that
she
could
not
meet
one
of
the
qualifications?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
she
wanted
to
test
the
situation?
