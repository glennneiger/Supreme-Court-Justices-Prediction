mr.
judd
f.
crosby
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
has
today
before
it
in
title
xix,
what
the
second
circuit
has
otherwise
described
as
a
long
and
complicated
statute.
given
the
complexity
of
the
statute,
respondents
submit
that
the
statute
is
certainly
capable
of
various
judicial
approaches.
the
approach
which
respondents
presented
to
the
court
in
our
brief
attempts
to
take
an
account
the
traditional
roles
of
all
the
participants
necessary
for
the
delivery
of
medical
services
to
the
indigent,
that
is
the
state,
the
provider
of
services
and
the
recipient
of
the
services.
keeping
that
distinction
in
mind,
as
we
go
through
the
argument,
i
think,
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
distinction
between
state
attempts
to
eliminate
a
broad
condition
and
state
attempts
to
limit
a
physician?s
choice
of
alternative
treatments
for
a
given
condition
because
as
we
see
with
the
situation
of
pregnancy
and
the
alternative
treatments
for
that
condition
that
the
realm
of
the
physician?s
discretion
which
my
brother
at
the
bar,
mr.
watkins
suggested
he
was
not
trying
to
interfere
with,
is
in
fact
being
interfered
with.
what
respondents
have
done
is
looked
to
section
1396-aa-17
of
the
act
which
requires
mandates
upon
the
states
that
they
include
reasonable
standards
for
determining
the
extent
of
medical
assistance
and
that
those
standards
must
be
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
what
respondents
extrapolate
from
that
language
is
that
the
state
must
have
some
rational
reason
when
they
begin
to
eliminate
services
from
coverage
under
the
medicaid
program.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
my
clients,
of
course
your
honor,
the
11
respondents
have
already
received
their
abortions
pursuant
to
the
temporary
restraining
order
back
in
1973.
the
state
instituted
a
temporary
revised
policy
where
they
eliminated
the
distinctions
between
medically
necessary
and
other
abortions
and
that
is
in
effect
today.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
well
yes,
the
third
circuit's
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
yes
your
honor.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
think
we
do.
i
do
not
think
if
we
are
talking
about
the
mootness
issue
in
terms
of
the
hyde
amendment,
i
do
not
think,
given
the
fact
that
it
was
enjoined
and
is
still
enjoined,
that
it
is
still
the
state
policy,
the
old
state
policy,
but
for
the
temporary
revised
policy
that
we
would
be
functioning
under.
continuing
then,
what
respondents
assert
is
that
we
must
look
at
what
interests
the
state
might
suggest
are
being
furthered
by
their
restrictive
medicaid
abortion
policy
which
is
consistent
with
what
the
lower
court
did.
initially
we
have
looked
to
a
fiscal
interest
and
respondents
submit
as
the
lower
court
found
that
given
the
cost
of
prenatal,
obstetrical
and
post
partum
care
that
there
is
simply
no
fiscal
interest
being
furthered
by
the
state?s
restrictive
medicaid
abortion
policy.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
only
the
statutory
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
think
that
the
fiscal
interest,
for
example,
congress
was
concerned
about
the
state?s
concern
for
its
limited
financial
resources
to
distribute
limited
medicaid
resources
and
that
is
why
we
would
submit
that
the
state
could,
in
some
cases,
rely
on
the
saving
of
money
as
an
interest
to
eliminate
particular
services.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
think
your
honor,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
standard
for
inclusion
then
what
we
are
saying
is
what
the
attorney
for
the
state
said
in
his
argument
that
is
that
he
is
going
to
look
to
the
physician?s
discretion
to
the
extent
that
a
particular
service
is
within
the
legitimate
practice
of
medicine
within
the
state
then
it
is
included
because
of
the
emphasis
that
the
statute
puts
on
physician?s
discretion.
now,
that
works
for
the
best
interest
of
the
recipient.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
no
your
honor,
the
social
security
act.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
the
emphasis
that
the
statute
places
on
the
physician?s
discretion
is
found
in
several
places
as
we
have
analyzed
in
our
brief.
first,
we
look
to
the
simplicity
of
the
administration
and
the
best
interest
requirements,
specific
statutory
requirements
and
say
that
within
those
two
provisions
is
found
the
notion
that
the
recipient?s
best
interest
can
only
be
furthered
when
the
doctor
is
making
the
decision
as
to
alternative
treatments
for
a
given
condition.
that
to
the
extent
of
the
state
becomes
involved
in
those
medical
determinations
as
this
court
realized
in
doe
v.
bolton
that
the
best
interests
of
the
recipients
are
not
being
served.
we
had
also
pointed
to
the
precedent
of,
excuse
me
not
the
precedent,
but
the
lower
court
decisions
in
row
v
ferguson,
in
row
v
norton
indicating
that
the
statute
places
great
emphasis
on
physician?s
discretion
and
also
we
point
to
page
8
of
the
brief
for
the
state
where
they
agree
that
the
statute
places
great
emphasis
on
physicians.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
if
the
state
excluded
appendectomy
your
honor,
it
would
have
to
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
those
interests.
i
think
that
may
be
out
there
somewhere
in
the
future
case.
i
think
that
there
are
specific
provisions,
for
instance,
the
h.e.w.
regulations
which
prohibited
an
exclusion
based
on
diagnosis
type
of
illness
or
condition.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
yes
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
what
that
means
is
if
a
particular
service
is
within
the
legitimate
practice
of
medicine
that
standard
says
it
should
be
included.
now,
we
do
not
admit
that
everything?
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
1396-aa-17,
your
honor.
the
state
must
include
reasonable
standards
to
determine
the
extent
of
medical
assistance
which
are
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
the
act.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
yes
your
honor.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct
your
honor.
what
we
are
saying
basically
is
that
what
that
means
is
that
given
the
particular
service
is
within
a
legitimate
practice
of
medicine
then
the
state
is
going
to
have
to
show
some
specific
interest
that
is
being
furthered
by
their
exclusion
of
that
acceptable
practice
and
this
is
particularly
important
when
the
state
is
not
eliminating
broad
conditions
as
the
lower
court
recognized.
it
is
particularly
important
when
the
state
is
directly
interfering
with
choice
of
the
physician.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
yes
your
honor.
if
they
are
going
to
be
reimbursed,
they
would
have,
the
stipulation
in
the
affidavit
of
attorney
r.
stanton
and
waldwick
(ph),
i
believe
it
is
page
31
of
the
appendix.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
no
the
physicians
refused
to
perform
the
abortion
and
that
is
why
the
temporary
restraining
order
had
to
be
issued.
they
refused
because
the
services
were
not
going
to
be
reimbursed
by
the
state.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
the
stipulation.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
no,
your
honor,
specifically
1396-aa-17
does
not
address
the
question
of
medical
necessity.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
they
talk
about,
there
is
some
language
for
instance
in
the
purpose
clause,
the
initial
clause
talking
about?
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
it
refers
to,
if
i
could
recall
the
exact
language,
it
is
necessary
medical
care
in
defining
the
class
of
persons
who
would
be
eligible.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
yes
your
honor,
because
respondents
submit
that
that
language,
what
that
means.
for
instance,
on
the
appendectomy
example
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
used
that
if
the
state,
perhaps
the
better
example
would
be
the
one?
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct
your
honor.
what
we
say
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
what
we
submit
your
honor
is
that
the
state
could
look
to
considerations
of
medical
necessity
in
certain
cases,
especially
when
eliminating
broad
conditions.
normally,
when
they
are
doing
that,
it
is
going
to
be
accompanied
by
the
interest?
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
it
does
on
the
case
so
far
your
honor.
what
respondents
are
saying
is
that,
under
a
particular
issue
before
the
court
today,
the
state?s
overall
interest
in
terms
of
saving
money,
preserving
maternal
health
and
safety,
they
are
not
going
to
be
defeated
by
affirming
the
circuit
court?s
decision.
proceeding
to
the
second
interest,
which
is
i
just
mentioned,
was
maternal
health
and
safety,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
an
article
not
mentioned
in
respondent?s
brief
which
is
the
morbidity
and
mortality
report
of
h.e.w.,
volume
24,
number
3,
dated
january
18,
1975
simply
substantiating
the
notion
that
abortion
services
in
any
trimester
are
safer
in
terms
of
mortality
and
morbidity
than
child
birth
and
i
would
also
refer
the
court
a
statement
to
that
effect
in
the
affidavit
of
doctor
douglas
thomas
in
the
appendix
of
page
36-a.
the
final
potential?
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
in
a
situation
like
that
your
honor,
given
the
utilization
review,
we
would
submit,
no.
we
would
distinguish
that
situation
very
clearly
from
a
situation
where
a
woman
is
pregnant
and
as
the
question
of
mr.
justice
stevens
brought
out
and
mr.
watkins
agreed
that
when
a
woman
is
pregnant,
she
requires
medical
services
and
the
only
question
is
are
the
medical
services
going
to
be
resolved
in
termination
of
the
pregnancy
or
they
are
going
to
be
addressed
to
the
woman?s
condition,
a
childbirth?
so
again,
in
terms
of
that
medical
necessity
thing,
i
will
bring
out
quickly
this
time
that
we
are
talking
about
a
condition
that
does
require
medical
services
and
that
is
distinguishable,
i
think
from
your
situation.
clearly,
if
the
woman
is
not
pregnant
then
we
are
not
maintaining
to
the
state
would
have
to
reimburse
for
the
abortion
services.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
two
points
then
your
honor.
i
think,
it
is
very
important,
given
the
section
of
the
act
that
we
are
going
under
to
understand
that
what
we
submit
the
state
is
putting
up
a
smokescreen
almost
in
terms
of
the
language
and
medical
necessity
and
they
cannot
as
we
are
to
the
brief
that
medical
necessity
in
a
vacuum.
it
is
not
sufficient
under
the
act.
that
is
normally
medical
necessity
consideration
for
furthering
other
interests
such
as
fiscal
interest.
i
can,
very
quickly
at
this
time
perhaps
diverge
from
a
normal
pattern
here
and
get
back
and
take
a
quick
look
that
some
of
the
considerations
that
mr.
watkins
raised.
for
example,
he
talked
about
the
illegality
of
abortions
in
1965.
i
would
refer
the
court,
in
terms
of
legislative
history,
to
the
house
report
number
213,
the
89th
congress,
1965,
page
24.
now,
that
house
report
was
talking
about
title
xviii
medicare,
but
as
many
other
courts
have
recognized,
the
legislative
history
can
be
read
somewhat
correctively
and
there,
they
specifically
stated
that
in
terms
of
the
extent
of
services
that
they
intended
to
include
new
services
as
they
were
adopted
in
the
future,
indicating
the
breadth
of
what
congress
intended
in
1965.
i
would
also
refer
the
court
to
the
drug
example
of
the
lower
court.
when
they
were
talking
about
(inaudible)
new
drugs
became
marketable
that
they
could
not
read
the
statute
as
requiring
them
to
be
prohibited.
also,
i
would
suggest
that
in
1972,
not
1965,
when
congress
amended
the
social
security
act
to
include
family
planning
services
that
they
were
aware
at
that
time
the
h.e.w
considered
abortion
to
be
part
of
comprehensive
system
of
family
planning
services.
there
again,
when
they
were
specific
using
the
term
family
planning
services,
indication
of
their
intent
to
include
abortion
and
finally
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
southeast
underwriter?s
association
a
322
u.s.
533
where
the
court
realized
the
expansive
nature
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
saying
is
involved
here
in
terms
of
allowing
for
new
services
as
they
are
developed
in
the
future,
meaning
of
course,
whether
or
not
they
are
legally
developed
in
the
future
or
medically
developed
in
the
future
as
they
become
an
accepted
legitimate
professional
service.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct
your
honor.
what
mr.
watkins
raised
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
specific
language
in
title
xix,
respondents
would
submit
that,
as
we
have
pointed
out
before,
that
the
second
circuit
described
it
as
the
long
and
complicated
statute
and
they
did
not
really
have
mentioned
any
specific
service
and
there
is
no
reason
to
have
expected
them
to
specifically
refer
to
abortion
services.
however,
we
would
also
submit,
in
terms
of
the
specificity
argument,
that
again,
the
term
family
planning
services
when
it
was
added
to
the
act
in
1972,
it
is
narrow
enough
in
terms
of
what
the
congress
was
attempting
to
accomplish
through
family
planning
services,
that
is
to
permit
indigent
women
to
limit
and/or
space
their
children,
that
the
very
alternatives
available
to
the
doctor
to
meet
that
purpose,
for
the
woman,
the
alternatives
are
so
narrow,
that
congress
must
have
meant
for
the
states
to
include
all
those
alternatives.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
the
latter.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
no.
i
assume
that
the
doctor
is
making
that
determination
because
of
alternative
anesthetics
available.
what
we
are
saying
is
when
the
doctor
and
the
woman
are
faced
with
condition
of
pregnancy;
they
have
two
alternatives,
childbirth
services
or
abortion
services.
and
in
that
context,
neither
service
can
be
considered
more
or
less
necessary
than
the
other
service.
so
it
is
distinguishable
from
a
situation
where
a
doctor,
for
very
obvious
reasons,
might
say
something
that
is
not
medically
necessary.
and
we
do
admit
that
the
state
can
consider
notions
of
medical
necessity
again
such
as
the
example
we
used
in
our
brief
which
was
the
physical
examination.
they
could
say
physical
examinations;
the
state
will
determine
are
not
medically
necessary.
now,
some
doctors
may
disagree
with
that,
but
to
the
extent
that
they
say
that
and
use
that
to
exclude
that
service,
they
are
also
saying
that
the
money
that
we
are
going
to
save
by
not
providing
those
services
can
be
addressed
to
more
urgent
needs.
but
when
the
state
says
medical
necessity,
in
terms
of
the
issue
before
the
court
today,
there
is
no
moneysaving.
there
is
no
one
else
to
be
serving.
there
is
no
interest
to
be
furthered
when
they
say
medical
necessity
at
the
time
of
utilization
of
the
service.
turning
quickly
to
the
family
planning
services
argument,
again,
trying
to
be
brief,
focusing
in
on
the
h.e.w
regulations,
respondents
submit
that
the
regulation
contained
in
the
45-cfr-249-10-a-5
namely
that
h.e.w.
requires
that
the
services
provided
must
be
sufficient
in
amount,
scope
and
duration
to
reasonable
achieve
their
purpose.
and,
what
we
are
saying
here
as
i
indicated
before,
the
specific
congressional
purpose
of
the
family
planning
services
was
to
permit
the
indigent
woman
to
limit
or
space
her
children.
that
goal
is
so
narrow
that
if
you
eliminate
what
has
been
professionally
accepted
as
a
part
of
a
comprehensive
system
of
family
planning
services,
namely
contraceptive,
abortion,
sterilization
and
treatment
for
infertility,
that
the
state?s
discretion
becomes
much
more
narrow
and
in
fact,
they
cannot
restrict
the
services
of
any
of
those
four
major
components
of
a
comprehensive
system
of
family
planning
services.
secondly,
as
to
the
categorically
needy
individuals,
we
focus
on
the
h.e.w.
requirement
that
the
state
cannot
arbitrarily
deny
or
reduce
the
amount,
scope
or
duration
of
the
service
because
of
the
type
of
illness
or
condition.
what
we
submit
for
the
categorically
needy
women
that
to
the
extent
that
a
woman?s
previous
family
planning
services
did
not
work,
that
is
a
method
of
contraception
failed
and
she
is
now
pregnant,
she
is
totally
being
excluded
by
the
state?s
restrictive
policy
and
secondly,
for
those
women
who
never
sought
family
planning
services
until
they
became
pregnant,
she
too.
we
have
two
classes
of
individuals
who
are
totally
being
excluded
by
the
state?s
policy.
returning
quickly
to
the
medical
necessity
issue,
our
position
here
is
that,
again,
medical
necessity
in
a
vacuum
that
is
where
the
state
cannot
show
some
other
interest
that
is
going
to
be
furthered
is
not
permitted
under
the
act
because
the
act
requires
a
rational
connection
between
the
exclusion
and
the
furthering
of
some
legitimate
state
purpose.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
your
honor,
i
think
the
cosmetic
point
is
disposed
off
simply
by
saying
as
mr.
watkins
indicated
that
at
the
point
where
doctors,
it
is
not
a
doctor?s
decision.
in
other
words,
the
doctor
does
not
address
to
him
or
herself
to
a
twisted
nose.
nothing
else
is
going
to
happen.
the
person
will
continue
to
have
a
twisted
nose,
unlike
the
pregnancy
example,
where
the
state
has
admitted
in
their
argument
that
the
condition
of
pregnancy
requires
medical
services
and
that
there
is
no
reason,
especially
given
this
court?s
announcements
in..
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct.
yes
and
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
see
the
connection
to
the
extent
that
they
are
trying
to
use
that
example
to
limit
the
abortions
that
they
will
cover
under
the
medicaid
program
by
saying
that
it
has
to
be
necessary
at
the
time
of
utilization
and
this
is
why
i
referred
to
it
earlier
as
a
smokescreen
in
terms
of
the
requirement
of
medical
necessity.
the
state
has
no
legitimate
reason,
especially
given
the
court?s
position
in
row
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
to
assert
that
an
abortion
service
is
any
more
or
less
necessary
or
childbirth
services
is
any
more
or
less
necessary
than
the
other.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct
your
honor
and
that
this
statute
has
to
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
what
the
state
can
do
under
the
guides
of
medical
necessity
with
that
in
mind.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
depending
on
how
we
look
at
medical
necessity
your
honor,
what
we
are
saying
at
that
point
is
a
particular
service
that
is
an
alternative
treatment
for
a
condition,
that
at
that
point
when
the
state
begins
to
draw
the
guidelines
as
they
have,
that
they
are
impermissibly
interfering
with
that
physician?s
discretion.
now,
if
you
are
out
of
the
area
of
what
you
are
talking
about?
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
could
never
hear
that
before
today,
your
honor.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
would
point
out
that
many
of
the
things
that
we
heard
today,
i
was
hearing
for
the
first
time
in
terms
of
what
the
state?s
program
will
cover.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
the
state?s
program
was
as
all
encompassing
as
it
was
presented
to
the
court
today
that
i
would
see
no
reason
why
they
had
contested
the
temporary
restraining
order
in
the
first
instance.
clearly,
there
are
grave
restrictions.
they
did
not
admit
that
any
of
the
women,
any
of
the
respondents
were
entitled
to
an
abortion.
they
fought
reimbursement
for
the
abortion
in
every
single
case.
i
would
submit
in
terms
of
the
issue
of
necessity
as
it
relates
back
to
the
court?s
announcement
in
doe
v.
bolton
that
in
fact
under
that
analysis
the
only
abortion
services
that
could
be
classified
as
unnecessary
would
be
those
where
the
woman
was
not
pregnant
or
where
the
abortion
services
were
not
going
to
operate
to
the
best
interests
of
the
woman.
that
is
where
perhaps
she
did
not
consent
or
was
not
aware
about
what
was
going
on
in
terms
of
medical
services.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
do
not
believe
they
would
have
your
honor.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
keep
in
mind
that
under
the
medical
assistance
program,
no
one
is
guaranteed
services.
in
other
words,
the
state
does
not
ensure
that
i,
as
a
potential
recipient,
am
going
to
have
a
doctor.
they
cannot
ensure
that
the
doctor
or
doctors
in
my
community
are
even
going
to
participate.
so
we
are
not
in
that
sense
talking
about
abortion
on
demand.
the
final
point
is
that
respondents
are
still
talking
about
services
performed
by
physicians
to
the
extent
that?
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
so
called
elective
abortion,
your
honor.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
what
we
say
your
honor
is
that
under
the
statute
there
is
no
distinction
between
elective
abortion
and
any
other
abortion.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
except
in
the
two
ways
that
we
singled
out.
it
is
still
the
decision
for
the
patient
in
consultation
with
the
doctor?
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
could
conceive
your
honor
of
a
physician
where
the
patient
did
not
elect
to
have
the
abortion,
but
because
of
very
obvious
factors
to
the
doctor,
that
he
would
advise
the
patient
to
go
through
with
an
abortion
and
they
can
include
many,
many
factors
that
the
court
recognized.
it
could
be
four
years
into
the
future
that
the
existence
of
the
unwanted
child
is
just
going
to
totally
disrupt
the
woman?s
existence.
so
we
are
still
saying
that
it
is
a
joint
decision.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
legitimate
statutory
purposes
have
to
be
defined
in
context
of
the
constitution
to
the
extent
that
that
interest
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
to
the
same
degree
as
in
row
your
honor.
that
interest
could
be
asserted
after
the
point
of
viability.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
yes
that
would
be
our
position
your
honor
because
again,
the
interests
have
to
be
interpreted.
mr.
judd
f.
crosby
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
