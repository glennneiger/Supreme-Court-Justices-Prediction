justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
you
mean,
?it
was
never
litigated
in
earnest??
was
it
litigated
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
watkins,
are
you
tying
that
definition,
however,
into
what
was
said
here
in
doe
against
bolton?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
you
are
conceding
that
medical
necessity
under
the
pennsylvania
statute
means
what
was
spelled
out
here
in
doe
against
bolton?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
is
a
substantial
concession
in
your
part,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
does
fund
pregnancy
at
some
time,
does
not
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and,
is
it
not
a
pretty
good
argument
that
does
fund
conditions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
do
not
think
you
have
answered
my
observations.
go
ahead.
