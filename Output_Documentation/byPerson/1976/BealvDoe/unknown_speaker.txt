unknown
speaker
what
did
it
do
about
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
from
some
of
your
prior
remarks,
you
were
equating
at
almost
the
abortion
on
the
bound,
but
i
am
accepting
your
concession.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
want
no
misunderstanding
about
it.
unknown
speaker
possibly,
this
subjective,
psychological
or
emotional
problem
caused
by
the
expectant
mother
by
her
concern
about
the
increase
in
the
family
might
be
such
a
health
problem,
such
as
would
lead
the
physician
to
certify
that
an
abortion
was
medically
necessary,
you
would
concede
that?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
apart
from
the
certification
by
the
two
other
physicians,
what
physician
is
this?
is
this?
unknown
speaker
the
woman?s
choice?
unknown
speaker
could
not
this
lead
to
physician
shopping?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
until
the
medical
association
or
some
other
such
authority
might
step-in
on
that
kind
of
an
issue,
the
state
accepts
with
finality
the
medical
opinion?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
thought
that
in
the
state?s
view
there
would
be
a
substantial
number
of
cases
in
which
a
position
that
would
not
certify
medical
necessity,
but
nevertheless
there
would
be
an
abortion
and
the
woman
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
obtain
that
under
this
court?s
decision?
unknown
speaker
we
would
not
want
to
reargue
the?
unknown
speaker
the
constitutional
issue,
but
i
understood
you
to
mean
that
there
would
be
cases
that
a
woman
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
get
an
abortion
from
somebody,
but
she
could
not
get
a
certification
of
medical
necessity?
unknown
speaker
unless
there
is,
this
case
?
this
case?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
that
segment
referred
to
by
my
brother
white,
a
woman
who
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
an
abortion
performed,
but
who
no
reasonable
qualified
physician
could
certify
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
health?
unknown
speaker
unless
there
is
such
a
segment.
this
case?
unknown
speaker
general
watkins,
before
you
leave
that
point,
the
court
of
appeals
listed
five
things,
five
conditions
that
had
to
be
met,
one
of
five
conditions
before
an
abortion
would
be
performed.
it
seems
to
me
they
described
the
right
to
an
abortion
in
pennsylvania
is
narrower
than
you
describe
it.
are
you
describing
a
non-therapeutic
abortion
in
the
same
terms
that
the
court
of
appeals
found?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
does
that
made
clear
to
the
physicians
in
pennsylvania?
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
you
regard
that
as
somewhat
a
contradiction
in
terms?
unknown
speaker
related
to
health?
unknown
speaker
general
watkins,
in
pennsylvania
is
it
lawful
for
anyone,
except
the
doctor,
to
perform
an
abortion?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
a
consumer
service
that
just
anybody
can
perform?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
take
it
when
a
pregnant
person
goes
to
the
doctor,
sooner
or
later,
she
is
going
to
require
some
kind
of
service
by
that
doctor
or
some
other
doctor?
unknown
speaker
there
is
medical
treatment
that
is
necessary.
unknown
speaker
she
can
make
one
choice,
she
gets
reimbursed,
another
choice,
she
does
not?
unknown
speaker
not
when
she
makes
the
choice,
if
the
physician
makes
a
choice
for
an
acceptable
reason?
unknown
speaker
mr.
general,
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
it
just
crossed
my
mind.
supposing
during
child
birth,
a
doctor
determined
that
it
would
be
desirable
for
a
patient
having
a
particular
kind
of
anesthesia,
but
that
was
not
really
necessary.
she
could
get
to
deliver
the
child
without
that
particular
anesthesia,
but
it
is
more
expensive.
would
she
be
reimbursed
for
that?
unknown
speaker
is
it
necessary
for
it
be
reimbursement?
unknown
speaker
but
not
medically
necessary.
that
is
my
question.
unknown
speaker
as
a
practical
matter
it
would
be
paid
for,
but?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
he
said,
?i
advised
her
that
it
was
not
necessary,
but
she
insisted
upon
it
as
a
matter
of
choice?
then
you
would
not
pay
for
it?
unknown
speaker
very
well
mr.
watkins.
mr.
crosby.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cosby,
i
am
confused
about
one
preliminary
matter
and
i
should
have
asked
mr.
watkins
maybe.
do
we
have
today
funding
for
these
abortions
that
your
clients
want?
unknown
speaker
as
a
result
of
this
injunction
and
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
but
are
funds
available?
unknown
speaker
what
in
the
light
of
the
hyde
amendments
are
the
funds
available?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
we
have
a
live
controversy
here.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
state
excluded
appendectomy?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
precise
statutory
tests?
is
it
as
the
government?s
amicus
brief
says,
whether
or
not
the
state?s
program
establishes
reasonable
standards
for
determining
the
extent
of
medical
assistance
under
the
plan
which
are
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
title
xix?
is
that
the
positive
standard?
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
statutory
preliminary
lead
here,
at
least
we
have
a
statutory
question?
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
what
the
state
has
done
here
is
consistent
with
title
xix
and
it
is
such
an
inquiry,
it
is
quite
important,
i
think
to
find
out
what
statutory
language
we
are
talking
about
and
have
i
correctly
quoted
the
applicable
statutory
language?
unknown
speaker
right,
those
are
the
dispositive
words?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
that
doctors
would
have
performed
these
abortions
in
these
people
here?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
was
not
medically
required?
unknown
speaker
but
my
point
was
they
would
have
done
it
if
they
had
been
paid?
unknown
speaker
even
though,
medically,
it
was
not
required,
is
the
record
clear
on
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
crosby,
does
1396
indicate
that
the
statutory
objective
of
meeting
the
cause
of
necessary
medical
assistance?
unknown
speaker
i
did
not
ask
about
a-17,
i
asked
about
1396,
anywhere
in
1396?
unknown
speaker
saying
what
the
purpose
of
the?
unknown
speaker
alright,
what
would
that
say?
unknown
speaker
do
you
not
think
that
is
rather
relevant
statutory
language
as
to
what
the
social
security
act
is
trying
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
any
different
in
what
pennsylvania,
at
least
claims
that
its
program
provides
for?
unknown
speaker
the
state
has
not
excluded
appendectomy.
does
it
claim
that
it
is
excluded
things
for
abortions
that
are
not
medically
necessary?
unknown
speaker
and
the
department
that
administers
the
act
says
that
this
is
what
the
act
aims
at,
namely
just
necessary
medical
services
and
that
pennsylvania?s
program
is
consistent
with
the
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
anyway
that
language
is
in
the
act
and
it
is
relevant
and
does
bear
on
the
case?
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on,
let
me
return
to
the
appendectomy.
there
was
a
period
in
medical
factor
says
these
things
go
and
appendectomies
were
a
fad
and
doctors
were
doing
it,
surgeons
were
doing
it
in
preventive
way,
so
that
you
do
not
have
an
attack
of
appendicitis
while
you
are
out
on
a
hunting
trip
or
some
such
thing.
now,
suppose
you
have
an
appendectomy
which
is
performed
that
where
was
no
medically
indicated
acute
condition
or
necessity
for
it,
but
for
which
a
surgeon
could
be
found
to
perform
it.
do
you
think
pennsylvania
should
pay
for
an
elective
appendectomy
which
is
not
medically
indicated?
unknown
speaker
mr.
crosby
can
i
just
interrupt?
i
am
still
troubled
by
the
same
problem
i
think
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
concerned
about.
you
are
arguing
about
state
interests
that
are
not
necessarily
served
here.
you
argue
the
physical
interest
and
maternal
health
interest,
but
neither
of
those
is
an
argument
made
by
your
opponent.
we
would
basically
have
a
statutory
question
and
you
have
not
met
any
of
the
seven
points
he
makes.
i
assume
you
are
going
to
meet
those
rather
than
arguing
what
sounds
to
me
like
a
constitutional
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
mr.
crosby,
let
me
just,
perhaps
you
have
answered
in
your
brief,
but
i
am
just
trying
to
be
sure
i
understand.
is
it
your
position
that
an
abortion
on
demand
is
?necessary?
within
the
applicable
standard
or
that
the
state
may
not
impose
the
standard
of
necessity?
unknown
speaker
and
so
it
may
not
impose
the
standard.
then
in
my
example
about
anesthesia
where
the
patient
wants
a
more
expensive
anesthesia
than
the
doctor
could
in
good
conscience
say
it
was
necessary,
is
she
entitled
to
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
crosby,
are
you
going
to
enter
the
cosmetic
point
on
which
the
state
put
reliance
on?
unknown
speaker
those
are
medically
required
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
you
see
no
connection?
unknown
speaker
it
is
because
once
a
woman
is
pregnant
it
is
clear
that
the
services
of
the
physicians
are
going
to
be
medically
necessary,
either
by
reason
of
miscarriage
or
a
live
birth
or
an
abortion?
unknown
speaker
does
the
fact
that
the
medical
services
are
necessary
mean
that
any
particular
medical
service,
namely
an
abortion,
is
in
that
category?
unknown
speaker
how
do
they
interfere
with
the
physician?s
discretion
when
the
state
suggested
that
the
physician
informs
the
state
that
it
is
medically
necessary
for
the
protection
of
health
or
life,
that
the
state
does
not
challenge
that?
it
is
the
affirmative
policy
of
the
state
to
reimburse
for
those
services.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is
considered
state?s
program.
unknown
speaker
let
us
change
the
question
to
elective
abortion
then
and
perhaps,
that
is
a
little
less
loaded.
unknown
speaker
when
elective
abortions
are
used,
the
state
must
pay
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well
then
your
answer
to
my
question
must
be
affirmative,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
have
an
elective
abortion
unless
the
woman
elects.
that
is
what
sets
this
chain
of
events
in
motion,
is
it
not?
if
she
does
not
elect
there
are
no
problems.
unknown
speaker
mr.
crosby,
you
indicate
that
the
necessity
issue
should
be
decided
against
the
background
of
some
state
interest
according
to
necessity.
would
you
say
that
a
state?s
interest
in
saving
the
lives
of
the
unborn
fetus
is
totally
illegitimate?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
not
a
compelling
interest
under
the
rule
but
is
it
not
totally
illegitimate
interest
that
should
be
entirely
ignored?
unknown
speaker
for
that,
there
is
not
interest
whatsoever,
you
would
say?
did
you
have
to
take
that
position?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
do
and
that
would
be
your
position?
unknown
speaker
for
the
first
trimester
there
is
absolutely
no
state
interest
whatsoever
in
saving
the
life
of
the
unborn?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
watkins,
how
do
you
respond
to
his
argument
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
medical
necessity
requirement
is
fiscal
and
in
order
to
avoid
the
unnecessary
expenditure
of
funds
and
then
here
the
abortion
would
be
the
less
expensive
of
all
the
alternatives?
unknown
speaker
perhaps,
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
she
did
not
give
the
legal
questions
any
thought
one
way
or
the
other,
but
that
her
attorneys
did?
