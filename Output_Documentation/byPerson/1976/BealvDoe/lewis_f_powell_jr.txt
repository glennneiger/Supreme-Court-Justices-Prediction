justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
first
of
be
is
beal
against
doe.
the
issue
is
whether
title
19
of
the
social
security
act
requires
states
that
participate
in
medicaid
programs
define
the
cost
of
non-therapeutic
abortions.
the
federal
act
establishes
a
program
supported
by
state
and
federal
funds
under
which
states
may
provide
medical
assistance
to
needy
persons.
the
act
requires
states
to
fund
several
general
categories
of
medical
aid.
but
it
expressly
authorizes
the
states
to
determine
the
extent
of
care
pursuant
to
reasonable
standards
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
concluded
the
pennsylvania
regulation
which
denied
funding
for
non-therapeutic
abortions
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
act.
we
take
a
different
view.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
conclude
that
pennsylvania's
regulation
comports
fully
with
the
act's
objective
of
providing
assistance
for
necessary
medical
services.
we
conclude
further
that
the
exclusion
of
non-therapeutic
abortions
was
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
accordingly,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
his
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined,
mr.
justice
marshall
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
such
an
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
