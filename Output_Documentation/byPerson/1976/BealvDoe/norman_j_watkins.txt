mr.
norman
j.
watkins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1965,
congress
enacted
title
ix
of
the
social
security
act,
which
is
commonly
better
referred
to
as
medicaid.
the
general
purpose
of
that
statute
was
to
provide
necessary
medical
services
for
the
indigent,
near
indigent
as
maybe
determined
by
the
states.
it
was
an
optional
program
on
the
states.
the
primary
or
premium
medical
judgment
of
the
physician
was
of
course
the
primary
fact
to
determine
which
services
should
be
reimbursed
and
which
should
not.
it
was
left
up
to
the
states
whether
or
not
the
recipients
or
the
providers
would
be
reimbursed
for
their
services.
there
are
general
requirements
in
the
statute
that
require
equality
of
treatment
for
the
various
groups
that
are
covered
within
a
program
and
there
are
general
descriptions
of
the
types
of
services
that
are
required.
there
are
five
basic
categories
of
services
which
cover
such
things
as
inpatient
services,
outpatient
services,
skilled
nursing
services,
physician
services
and
the
like.
pennsylvania
opted
to
participate
in
this
program
and
accordingly
drew
up
a
plan,
a
medicaid
plan,
which
was
submitted
to
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
and
approved
by
that
department.
the
plan
again,
consistent
with
title
xix
places
primary
reliance
on
the
physician?s
judgment
as
to
which
services
in
the
covered
categories
would
be
necessary
and
required,
as
required
also
by
the
federal
statute.
pennsylvania
has
a
utilization
review
program
which
reviews
the
use
of
services
to
make
sure
that
unnecessary
services
are
not
being
dispensed
and
reimbursed
under
the
program.
as
part
of
the
program,
pennsylvania
covers
pregnancy
related
medical
services,
including
abortion.
however,
each
such
service
must
be
medically
necessary
at
the
time
of
its
utilization.
this
is
the
controversy.
this
is
where
the
controversy
arises
in
pennsylvania
and,
in
this
case.
pennsylvania?s
abortion
policy
basically
requires
that
at
the
time
abortion
service
is
rendered,
it
would
be
medically
necessary
in
the
judgment
of
the
physician,
that
is
that
the
condition
for
which
the
abortion
is
prescribed
threatens
the
health
or
the
life
of
the
mother.
there
is
also
a
two-doctor
concurrence
and
the
requirement
that
the
abortion
be
performed
in
j.c.a.h.
accredited
hospital.
those
two
requirements
were
never
litigated
in
earnest
in
this
case
and
it
is
quite
reasonable
with
respect
to
the
two-doctor
concurrence
because
that
i
am
told
in
practice
is
rather
a
rubber
stamp.
in
any
event?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
it
was
raised.
it
was
challenged
in
the
original
complaint
mr.
justice
blackmun.
however,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
discuss
these
issues
and
their
lack
of
compliance
with
respect
to
title
xix
or
the
constitution.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
all
pregnant
women
with
pregnancies
ranging,
i
believe,
from
seven
to
17
weeks
term.
by
their
own
admission,
at
least
some
of
the
plaintiffs
in
affidavits
filed
and
contained
in
the
joint
appendix,
some
of
the
women
sought
their
abortion
for
reasons
totally
unrelated
to
health.
in
fact,
the
stipulation
of
counsel
filed
in
this
case
so
states.
accordingly,
these
women
were
not
able
to
procure
the
required
certification
of
medical
necessity
from
the
attending
physician
or
two
other
physicians,
and
therefore,
they
were
unable
to
receive
the
abortion
because
they
were
indigent,
they
were
unable
to
provide
the
funds
to
procure
the
abortion
on
their
own.
thus,
this
lawsuit
was
filed
challenging
these
medicaid
regulations
on
both
statutory
basis
and
on
the
constitutional
basis.
this
record
held
that
pennsylvania?s
medical
necessity
requirements
applied
to
abortion
does
not
violate
title
xix,
but
rather
the
court
went
on
quite
properly
and
decided
that,
under
the
constitution,
in
its
view,
with
one
judge
dissenting,
the
regulation
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
on
bunk
affectively
reversed
that
holding
of
the
lower
court
and
found
that
pennsylvania?s
medicaid
regulations
as
applied
to
abortion
violate
title
xix
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
it
did
not
go
to
the
constitutional
question
under
this
court?s
teaching
in
higgins
vs.
levine.
there
are,
in
my
view,
at
least
seven
compelling
reasons
why
this
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
bunk
must
be
reversed.
first,
as
the
court
was
well
aware,
in
1965,
when
title
xix
was
inactive.
non-therapeutic
and
i
might
say
at
outset
that
i
am
using
the
terms,
non-therapeutic
medically
unnecessary
interchangeably,
i
do
not
see
any
distinction
between
the
two
nor
the
court
of
appeals,
nor?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
am
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely!
and,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
to
indicate
to
the
contrary.
in
fact?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
it
is
not
a
concession
at
all
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
1970
policy
of
the
pennsylvanian
medical
society
which
formed
the
basis
for
our
regulations,
in
fact
points
out
that
both
psychological
or
physical
health
reasons
certainly
should
be
taken
into
account
by
the
physician
in
determining
the
necessity
of
an
abortion
and
as
well,
i
might
say
the
physicians
in
pennsylvania,
like
every
other
state
are
certainly
bound
by
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
and
the
teachings
of
this
court.
pennsylvania
certainly
realizes
that
it
could
not
restrict
the
physician?s
judgment
to
any
narrower
scope
than
this
court
pronounced.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
let
me
make
perfectly
clear,
my
concession.
that
is
that
a
physician,
in
examining
a
patient,
may
take
psychological,
physical,
emotional,
familial
considerations
into
mind.
and,
in
the
light
of
those
considerations,
might
determine
if
those
factors
affect
the
health
of
the
mother
to
such
an
extent
as
he
would
deem
an
abortion
necessary.
i
think,
the
key
in
the
bolton
language
and
the
key
in
the
voice
language
is
the
fact
that
the
physician,
using
all
of
these
factors,
and
there
are
probably
more
that
he
should
use,
must
determine
if
the
woman?s
health,
that
is
her
physical
or
psychological
health,
is
jeopardized
by
the
condition
of
pregnancy.
that
is
not
to
say,
obviously,
as
i
believe
the
plan
is
to
assert
that
the
fact
that
the
family
is
going
to
increase
makes
an
abortion
medically
necessary.
if
that
were
the
case
and
if
that
is
what
this
court
meant
then
i
would
say
that,
what
we
are
really
saying
is
that
the
only
medically
unnecessary
abortion
is
when
the
woman
is
not
pregnant
and
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
was
reaching
that
resolve
in
voich
or
bolton.
certainly?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely.
again,
i
do
not
concede
these
concessions.
this
is
the
clear
policy
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
in
fact,
until
the
filing
of
the
respondent?s
brief
in
this
case,
the
use
of
the
term
health
in
pennsylvania
has
never
even
been
raised.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
pennsylvania
it
is
the
physician
that
determines
whether
or
not
an
abortion
is
medically
necessary.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
this
would
be
the
physician
of
the
woman?s
choice.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
very
possibly.
that
is
something
that
we
cannot
and
do
not
pretend
to
control.
if
some
physicians
have
a
very,
very
broad
view
of
medical
necessity,
that
is
their
judgment.
they
are
physicians.
they
are
licensed
to
practice
medicine.
as
long
as
it
is
legal
and
as
long
as
their
professional
organization
says
that
they
are
practicing
medicine
within
the
proper
realm,
it
is
not
for
the
common
welfare
of
pennsylvania.
it
is
not
for
welfare
bureaucrats
to
tell
a
physician
which
abortion
is
medically
necessary
and
which
abortion
is
not
and
that
is
not
the
portent
of
this
plan.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
this
is
a
trickier
question.
obviously
as
i
have
said
at
the
outset
there
is
a
utilization
review
program.
now,
if
a
certification
of
medical
necessity
came
in
and
from
the
face
of
it,
and
i
am
telling
you
now
what
the
department
tells
me,
although
again,
the
record
does
not
contain
this
because
it
was
never
challenged,
if
on
the
face
of
it,
it
is
apparent
say
that
physician
never
treated
this
individual
then
there
would
be
a
review,
but
if
there
is
nothing
irregular
on
the
face
of
it,
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
different
treatment
of
an
abortion
reimbursement
request
than
any
other
reimbursement
request.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
if
this
court
analyzes
the
constitutional
problem
on
the
basis
of
reasonableness
which,
i
think,
is
the
appropriate
standard
then
i
would
say
that
these
requirements
also
meet
constitutional
muster
because
they
are
entirely
reasonable
as
a
medical
services
program,
a
medical
services
program?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
constitutional
question?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
there
may
be
those
cases.
i
cannot?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no,
no
that
is?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
absolutely
correct.
in
fact,
that
is
the
situation
these
plaintiffs
were
in.
they
were
unable
to
obtain
that
certification
of
medical
necessity.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
believe
so.
in
other
words,
when
i
say
it
is
the
bottom
line
of
those
regulations
other
than
the
physical
deformity
provision.
the
bottom
line
is
whether
or
not
the
pregnancy
creates
a
condition
that
jeopardizes,
threatens
the
health
or
life
of
the
mother.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
and,
my
point
is
that
when
the
physician
examines
the
mother,
he
of
course
applies
these
course
teachings
in
voich
and
bolton
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
health
threatening
condition.
anything
to
the
contrary
would
clearly
violate
the
holdings
in
these
cases.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
i
assume
that
it
is
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
pennsylvania
medical
society,
which
i
assume
represents
a
good
segment
of
them,
issued
the
policy
statement
from
which
we
adopted
these
regulations
and
in
fact,
contained
in
the
brief,
in
the
section,
statutes
involved,
there
is
a
hypothetical
that
the
medical
society
used
to
point
out
that
psychological
and
emotional
as
well
as
physical
considerations
may
well
be
taken
into
account.
i
might
add
that
that
is?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
that
is
in
the
statutes
involved
in
section
of
my
brief.
i
think
it
was
in
fact
a
published
medical
society
physician.
returning
to
the
other
reasons
why
i
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals?
opinion
must
be
reversed
and
i
will
try
to
move
more
rapidly.
as
i
pointed
out
a
non-therapeutic
abortion
in
31
states,
at
least
in
1965
was
in
fact
illegal.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
that
congress
would
have
mandated
and
we
got
to
keep
that
in
mind
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
arguing
that
not
only
this
title
xix
allows
reimbursement
for
non-therapeutic
abortions,
but
in
fact
it
requires
it.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
conceive
that
congress
would
have
required
states
to
fund
a
procedure
that
was
in
fact
illegal
on
the
vast
majority
of
them.
secondly,
title
xix
itself
makes
no
mention
whatsoever
of
abortion.
couple
that
with
the
fact
that,
every
time
save
one,
every
time
that
congress
has
addressed
this
issue,
it
has
in
one
way
or
another
expressed
its
clear
displeasure
with
non-therapeutic
abortions.
the
save
one
is
the
possible
removal
of
the
prohibition
against
funding
of
abortions
as
a
family
planning
device,
but
there
has
never
been
an
affirmative
expression
or
approval
by
congress
of
non-therapeutic
abortions
or
funding
thereof.
next
and
fourth
i
believe
this
is,
every
other
circuit
court
that
i
am
aware
of
that
has
addressed
this
issue
has
gone
contrary
to
the
certain
circuit
on
this
point.
fifth,
pennsylvania?s
medical
necessity
requirement
and
i
have
already
eluted
to
this,
is
entirely
reasonable.
there
can
be
nothing
more
reasonable
in
my
view
than
in
a
medical
services
program
relying
on
the
judgment
of
the
physician
to
determine
which
services
are
reasonable,
which
services
are
necessary
and
which
services
are
not.
sixth,
the
lower
court?s
reasoning
which
basically
relies
on
two
points
is
faulty.
first,
the
court
held
that
the
medical
necessity
requirement
interferes
with
the
judgment
of
the
physician.
well,
we
have
discussed
this
already.
but
again,
i
will
reiterate
it.
so
there
is
no
confusion
about
pennsylvania?s
position.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
certainly
do.
the
lower
court?s
holding
in
fact,
i
found
a
little
bit
curious
in
the
sense
that
it
says
that
we
interfere
with
the
physician?s
choice
of
non-therapeutic
abortion.
to
me,
that
is
a
contradiction.
physicians,
exercising
their
medical
judgment,
do
not
choose
non-therapeutic
services.
the
exercise
of
medical
judgment
a
fortiori
to
me,
is
that
when
the
physician
determines
service
is
necessary
he
is
determining
that
it
is
necessary
for
medical
reasons.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely.
pennsylvania
does
not
pay
for
those
as
part
of
its
medicaid
program.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
nose
repair
let
us
say
for
purely
cosmetic
reasons
would
not
be
a
therapeutic
procedure.
it
would
be
a
medical
service.
this
is
no
question
that
the
physician
will
be
required
to
perform
it.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no
question
about
it
and
a
physician
probably
would
be
required
to
perform
it,
but
that
does
not
make
it
medically
necessary.
in
other
words,
when
the
physician
examines
this
individual,
his
diagnosis
would
not
be,
?you
need
to
repair
your
nose.?
the
physician,
in
that
instance
that
you
raise
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
really
a
technician.
he
is
performing
a
service
requested
by
the
patient.
the
motivational
factor
is
probably
the
key
in
this
case.
who
requests
the
service?
is
it
the
physician
that
requests
the
abortion?
if
it
is,
we
pay.
is
it
the
woman
that
requests
the
abortion?
if
it
is,
then
we
want
to
know
from
the
physician,
despite
this
request,
in
your
judgment,
is
this
procedure
necessary?
that
is
why
i
say
the
court?s
holding
in
the
first
instance
is
probably
a
contradiction
in
terms,
at
least
to
my
mind.
i
have
yet
been
unable
to
understand
the
distinction
between
non-therapeutic
and
medically
unnecessary.
secondly,
the
court
held
that
our
medical
necessity
requirement
violates
the
general
broad
equality
positions
of
title
xix.
now,
i
have
examined
that
reasoning
very
closely
and
all
that
can
be
set
forth
is
that
they
have
pointed
to
no
instance
in
pennsylvania
where
the
medical
necessity
requirement
is
not
applied
and
in
fact,
if
the
lower
court?s
opinion
is
to
stand,
what
will
be
created
is
a
situation
where
the
woman
who
requires
an
abortion
for
non-medical
reasons
will
be
treated
differently
than
all
other
medical
assistance
recipients
in
pennsylvania
because
she
will
be
entitled
to
reimbursement
for
a
procedure
non-medically
necessary
where
no
others
would.
the
final
reason
that
i
am
convinced
that
the
lower
court?s
opinion
must
be
reversed
is
the
fact
that
respondents
themselves
have
conceded
that
a
medical
necessity
requirement
is
in
fact
permissible
under
title
xix.
i
have
addressed
this
in
my
reply
brief.
unfortunately,
i
was
informed
this
morning
that
my
opposing
counsel
has
not
yet
received
it,
i
furnished
him
a
copy.
i
am
not
certain
what
the
problem
was
there,
the
service
was
made.
the
problem
with
this
position
of
the
respondents
is
first,
that
it
is
a
little
late.
they
have
never
questioned
the
use
of
the
term
health
in
pennsylvania
before.
there
has
been
no
discussion
of
it
in
either
of
the
opinions
below.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
and
we
have
discussed
this
quite
line,
pennsylvania,
as
early
as
1970,
recognized
that,
and
in
fact,
has
no
intention
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
that
physician?s
judgment.
we
just
want
to
make
sure.
we
want
to
ensure
that
that
step
is
not
omitted.
it
is
a
medical
services
program,
therefore,
we
want
the
physician
to
tell
us
that
these
services
are
required
not
the
woman.
now,
there
had
been
some
fairly
sophisticated
definitions
and
syllogisms
urged
upon
this
court
by
an
amicus
and
the
respondents.
one,
being
that
it
is
the
condition
of
pregnancy
that
determines
whether
a
service
is
medically
necessary.
i
would
submit
to
you
first
that
pennsylvania
does
not
fund
conditions.
it
funds
services
and
again,
it
is
the
physician.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no
question
about
it.
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no,
i
will
only
say
that
the
condition
of
pregnancy,
for
instance,
one
physician
may
treat
pregnancy
with
a
series
of
services
a,
b
and
c.
pennsylvania
pays
for
those.
another
physician
may
treat
pregnancy
with
services
d,
e
and
f.
we
pay
for
the
services.
the
physician
determines
what
the
condition
requires.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
argument
can
be
made
and
has
been
made.
i
do
not
see
the
tie-in
quite
frankly.
the
second
step
of
this
rationale
is
that
medical
necessity
must
be
defined
as
that
type
of
procedure,
that
procedure
which
is
a
safe
and
efficacious
response
to
the
problem.
first,
what
is
the
problem?
is
the
problem
medical
or
is
it
economic
or
social?
in
this
case,
these
plaintiffs
had
an
economic,
social,
educational
problem.
they
did
not
have
a
medical
problem.
that
is
the
first
problem
with
that
definition.
if
the
problem
is
medical,
again,
pennsylvania
pays.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well
no,
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
they
cannot
find
a
doctor
that
would
say
the
abortion
is
medically
necessary
to
preserve
or
to
stave
off
if
it
affected
their
health.
they
certainly
can
find
a
doctor
who
would
perform
the
abortion
just
as
i
could
certainly
find
a
doctor
to
perform
cosmetic
surgery
on
them.
the
distinction
is
that
one
is
a
consumer
service,
albeit
a
medical.
the
other,
is
a
medical
prescription
for
treatment.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
related
to
health?
that
is
what
pennsylvania
intends
to
fund
with
its
limited
medicaid
resources
and
if
this
court
would
reverse
the
lower
court
that
is
what
pennsylvania
will
be
permitted
to
fund.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is,
but
i
am
not
a
hundred
percent
certain
of
it.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct,
it
is
a
medical
service,
but
the
distinction
to
me
is
very
real
and
very
clear.
that
is,
if
i
go
to
a
physician
because
i
am
dissatisfied
with
my
appearance,
i
know
that
i
have
to
go
to
a
physician
because
i
cannot
get
that
service
anywhere
else.
so
it
is
a
medical
service,
no
question
about
that,
but
the
physician
is
not
telling
me
that
i
need
that
service
to
preserve
my
health.
i
am
telling
the
physician
i
want
it
because
my
social
life
had
an
in-pass.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
if
she
makes
one
choice,
she
does
not
get
reimbursed.
if
the
physician
makes
the
choice,
she
gets
reimbursed.
the
problem
is?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no,
well,
pennsylvania
does
not
place
a
premium
on
a
physician?s
choice
of
abortion
for
non-medical
reasons.
the
reason
to
me
is
entirely
reasonable.
physicians
are
trained
in
the
skill
of
diagnosing
medical
needs.
pennsylvania
places
a
premium
on
that.
pennsylvania
does
not
place
a
premium
on
the
physician?s
recommendations
of
how
to
provide
a
better
economic
or
social
environment
for
that
particular
family.
that
is
entirely
reasonable
in
my
view.
thus,
if
the
physician,
at
any
stage
in
the
pregnancy
says
abortion
is
necessary,
it
is
paid
for
or
any
other
service,
it
is
paid
for.
in
fact,
if
the
woman
came
in
and
demanded
delivery
services
before
the
physician
said
they
were
necessary,
they
would
not
be
paid
for
either.
is
the
question,
who
is
requesting
the
service,
who
determines
whether
it
is
necessary?
the
problem
with
the
lower
court?s
analysis
is
that
if
it
is
extrapolated,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
cap
it.
if
you
determine
that
it
is
a
condition
that
determines
medical
necessity,
you
really
have
taken
the
physician
out
of
it.
you
have
taken
the
physician
out
of
the
program
thus
pennsylvania
can
list
30
or
40
conditions
and
that
is
it,
any
service
that
any
physician
will
perform
for
that
condition,
be
it
an
accurate
dispensation
of
services
or
not,
pennsylvania
must
be
required
to
pay.
we
consider
that
error
and
we
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
opinion
of
the
third
circuit.
thank
you!
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
if
the
physician?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
we
give
the
physician
broad
discretion
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
brought
out
of
me
initially
in
this
argument.
if
the
physician
thinks
that
it
is
advisable
in
his
view.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
then,
it
would
not
be
paid
for.
as
a
practical
matter
there
would
be
no
way
of?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
probably
there
would
be
no
way
of
marshalling
it
because
the
physician
would
not
say
that
it
is
not
medically
necessary.
if
the
physician
came
out
and
said,
?i
applied
this
most
expensive
anesthesia
although
it
was
not
medically
necessary,?
it
would
not
be
reimbursed.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
absolutely.
that
is
correct.
thank
you!
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
three
points,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
the
reason
that
my
brother
opponent
is
hearing
a
lot
of
this
for
the
first
time
is
of
course
he
has
raised
a
lot
of
it
for
the
first
time
at
this
late
date.
i
might
point
out
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist?s
question
we
do
have
a
lot
of
controversy
because
the
plaintiffs
themselves
admitted
and
i
am
quoting
from
page
1
and
2
of
my
reply
brief.
?in
a
stipulation
filed
with
the
court,
continuance
of
the
pregnancy
did
not
threaten
the
health
or
life
of
the
mother,?
referring
to
some
of
the
plaintiffs
of
this
case.
so
there
is
no
question,
but
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
seeking
an
elective,
non-medically
necessary
abortion,
however
that
term
is
defined.
obviously,
these
stipulations
were
of
plaintiff?s
counsel.
there
can
be
no
question
at
this
point
that
we
have
a
live
controversy.
secondly,
counsel
asserts
that
family
planning
services
requirement
of
title
xix
is
broad
enough
to
cover
abortions.
it
may
well
be.
the
question
is
not
whether
it
is
broad
enough
to
cover
abortions,
the
question
is
does
it
mandate
abortions?
in
fact,
i
would
inform
the
court
that
h.e.w.
which
by
the
way
has
taken
a
position
supporting
the
commonwealth
through
the
solicitor
general,
in
this
case,
h.e.w.
will
not
reimburse
abortions
as
a
family
planning
device
logically
because
the
reimbursement
rate
is
quite
high.
it
is
90%
for
that
family
planning
device
and
it
is
substantially
lower
in
the
other
portion
of
the
act.
respondents
are
arguing
that
pregnancy
requires
medical
services
and
i
quote
my
opponent,
?and
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
the
pregnancy
is
going
to
be
terminated.?
that
is
not
the
only
question.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
services
are
sought
by
the
physician
or
sought
by
the
patient.
whether
or
not
they
are
elective
or
whether
or
not
they
are
medically
required.
if
they
are
the
latter,
we
pay.
if
they
are
the
former,
we
do
not
and
this
is
consistent
throughout
the
entire
program
with
the
exception
of
family
planning
which
is
by
definition
a
preventive
medical
care
program.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
the
point
is
that
a
pregnant
woman
going
to
a
physician
for
examination
of
pregnancy,
she
has
the
option,
clearly,
to
say,
?i
want
to
terminate
this
pregnancy.?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
or
go
through
the
childbirth,
but
the
physician?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
is
correct,
but
the
physician
under
pennsylvania?s
medicaid
program,
has
the
option
of
choosing
all
the
pregnancy
related
services
that
he
in
his
medical
judgment
determine,
are
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
that
woman?s
health.
in
this
case,
the
physicians
and
the
plaintiffs
by
their
own
admission
did
not
need
an
abortion
for
the
preservation
of
their
health.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
no,
i
did
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
however,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
filed
affidavits
of
their
own
in
which
they
at
least
in
and
i
pointed
out
in
my
footnote
of
my
main
brief,
at
least
two
of
them
affirmatively
stated
that
they
did
not
seek
abortions
for
health
reasons.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
i
can
only
assume
one
i
assume
it
was
true
and
two
i
assume
that?
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
she
wanted
to
test
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
fabric
of
her
contention.
but,
first
and
foremost,
i
certainly
hope
it
was
true.
mr.
norman
j.
watkins
that
i
could
not
say
your
honor.
all
we
could
do
is
deal
with
the
facts
as
they
are
put
before
us
and
here
the
facts
are
very
clear.
thank
you
very
much.
