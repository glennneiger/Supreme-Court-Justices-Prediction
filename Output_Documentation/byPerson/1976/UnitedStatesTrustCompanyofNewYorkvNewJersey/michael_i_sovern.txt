mr.
michael
i.
sovern
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
of
all
the
hundreds
of
cases
alleging
contract
impairment
that
have
come
before
this
court
in
two
centuries,
none
has
involved
public
ends
as
vital
as
those
sought
to
be
served
by
the
state
here
and
few
would
involve
contract
infringements
so
inconsequential.
in
the
second
slaughter
house
case,
the
court
found
offensive
smell
sufficiently
serious
to
bring
butchering
squarely
within
the
state's
police
power
and
the
justification
for
the
state's
repealing
a
statute
granting
an
exclusive
franchise
to
a
company
that
had
invested
large
sums
of
money
in
reliance
on
a
promise
that
the
exclusive
franchiser
would
be
good
for
25
years.
no
one
suggested
that
butchering
threatened
anybody’s
life
would
help.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
as
the
way
that
it
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
police
power
was
asserted.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
repeal
did
not
involve
their
losing
the
right
to
continue.
all
they
lost
was
the
right
to
do
it
exclusively.
so,
the
existence
of
the
police
power
justified
a
destruction
of
a
very
valuable
pushing
of
their
investment.
even
though
there
had
been
explicit
promise
that
was
be
to
be
good
for
25
years
and
the
justification
was
that
when
one
is
dealing
with
stench,
the
state
has
the
power
to
act
as
it
will.
here,
the
federal
environmental
protection
administrator
has
found
automobile
emissions
so
threatening
to
the
physical
well
being
of
the
citizens
of
new
jersey
that
he
has
ordered
them
to
drive
less.
he
has
insisted
that
parking
facilities
be
limited,
that
trucks
not
pick
up
or
deliver
on
weekday
mornings
from
six
to
11,
with
all
the
economic
dislocation
that
entails,
and
has
said
that
if
these
and
other
measures
don’t
work,
he
will
reduce
the
amount
of
gasoline
that
may
be
sold
in
the
state.
in
blaisdell,
as
this
court
knows
well
that
the
court
upheld
minnesota’s
mortgage
moratorium
act
because
of
the
economic
distress.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
the
covenant
does
two
things,
your
honor,
that
it
is
critical
to
correct.
one
is,
it
effectively
prevents
the
imposition
of
higher
tolls
on
the
users
of
the
port
authority’s
bridges
and
tunnels
between
new
york
and
new
jersey.
that
is
to
say
because
the
port
authorities’
revenues
and
reserves
are
so
large,
a
toll
rise
on
the
bridges
would
be
disapproved
as
not
just
unreasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
bridge
act
of
1906
which
means
that
the
disincentive
to
automobiles
crossing
from
new
jersey
to
new
york,
the
port
authority
owns
all
of
the
crossings
between
those
two
states
in
the
district.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
no,
your
honor.
there
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
there
are
many
other
methods
at
least
some
of
which
would
be
far
more
destructive
of
the
bondholders’
interest
without
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
ah.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
you
could
your
honor.
i
do
believe
mr.
milburn
would
be
here
maintaining
that
that
was
a
violation
of
covenants
with
bondholders.
i
do
believe
that
the
police
power
does
entitle
a
state
to
do
that.
this
is
far
less
intrusive
on
bondholder
rights.
the
bridges
are
among
the
port
authorities
biggest
money
makers.
i
believe
the
states
could
close
them.
i
believe
the
states
could
close
them
during
the
summers,
during
commuting
hours,
for
as
many
hours
as
they
wish,
that
bore
the
relationship
that
was
necessary
to
reduce
carbon
monoxide
and
hydrocarbon
poison.
the
bondholders
would
be
seriously
hurt
by
that.
they’ve
not
been
hurt
at
all
in
this
case.
that
point
is
important
to
focus
on,
so
that
the
states
here
have
sought
to
achieve
their
goals
in
the
ways
that
at
least
destructive
of
the
interest
that
aren’t
being
claimed
to
have
been
violated.
to
complete
my
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stevens,
not
only
does
the
covenant
prevent
that
particular
mode
of
responding
to
the
pollution
problem
it
also
prevents
what
all
students
of
this
subject
regard
as
the
most
rational
approach
and
that
is
to
say
to
use
charges
imposed
upon
other
drivers
to
support
mass
transit.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
the
difficulty,
your
honor
is
that
the
covenant
is
absolutely
categorical
and
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
unquestionably
not,
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
milburn
says,
the
only
person
from
whom
he
heard
how
difficulty
would
be
was
me.
the
chief
witness
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
trial
court
was
mr.
john
thompson.
at
page
192
of
the
appendix.
mr.
thompson
wrote
as
follows,
“in
my
opinion
and
approach
to
the
bondholders
for
modification
of
the
1962
restrictions
accompanied
by
a
moderate
increase
in
interest
rates
on
their
bonds
would
fail,
partly
because
it
would
be
unacceptable
and
partly
because
of
the
procedural
difficulties
--"
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
mr.
thompson
was
plaintiff’s
witness
called
to
discuss
this
question
among
others.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
oh,
he
said
he
was
presented
as
an
expert
on
the
bond
market,
the
rights
of
bondholders
and
the
behavior
of
the
investment
community.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
i'm
not
clear
your
honor.
his
basic
position
was
that
any
moderate
rise
in
the
interest
rate
for
bondholders
would
not
induce
them
to
come
out
and
go
through
the
procedures
required
to
consent
the
end
changes.
that
is
to
say,
there
is
a
very
elaborate
procedure
for
bondholder
change.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
i
think
not,
your
honor.
there
would
have
been
several
problems.
one
is
that
the
legislation
governing
tolls
on
bridges
is
federal,
that
is
to
say
the
bridge
act
of
1906
entrusts
now
to
the
federal
highway
administrator,
the
discretion,
judgment
really
to
determine
what
the
bridge
tolls
are
just
and
reasonable.
in
his
proceeding
and
it
has
been
confirmed
in
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals,
he
has
taken
into
account
the
use
to
which
tolls
are
put
and
has
declared
that
the
use
of
tolls
for
the
purpose
of
mass
transit
justifies
a
higher
toll
than
would
otherwise
be
permissible.
therefore,
the
simple
modification
of
the
new
jersey
legislation
to
raise
tolls
would
not
pass
federal
muster.
moreover
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
it
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
it
can
as
part
of
a
package,your
honor,
that’s
the
point.
the
covenant
blocks
a
coordinated
addressing
of
these
problems.
what
it
does
when
it’s
gone,
you
can
then
take
a
package,
it
says
you
charge
higher
toll,
creating
disincentive
to
those
polluting
automobiles.
you
take
those
increased
tolls,
you
support
mass
transit.
with
that
mass
transit
you
then
provide
the
alternative
to
those
auto
drivers
so
that
you’re
not
just
simply
preventing
them
from
travel.
and
it
is
that
coordinated
attack
on
the
problems
of
the
state
that
the
covenant
precludes.
now,
its
not
just
pollution
as
this
court
knows
very
well,
the
energy
problems
of
the
region
were
critical.
indeed,
the
gun
battles
that
attended
the
fuel
oil
allocations
in
ports
of
this
country
were
of
very
strong
resemblance
to
the
way
which
minnesota
farmers
greeted
the
foreclosing
sheriffs
and
judges,
and
the
economic
dislocation
that
the
federal
environmental
protection
administrators
told
us
this
state
must
there
if
it
is
to
become
to
apply
with
federal
law
is
very
much
like
the
kind
of
destruction
of
economic
affairs
that
reflected
in
minnesota.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
there's
no
question
about
that
your
honor
that
neither
legislature
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
the
different
--
yes,
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
the
difficulties
are
not
simply
those
of
political
choice
the
state
has
only
the
most
limited
kinds
of
controls
left
to
it
really
is
under
the
gun
of
those
environmental
orders.
and
when
the
environmental
protection
administrator
tells
the
state
of
new
jersey
that
it
must
sell
no
more
gasoline
than
it
did
in
1973,
i
do
not
know
where
politics
would
be.
i
would
guess
there
are
a
lot
more
new
jersey
voters
who
never
cross
the
hudson
and
that
closing
down
the
bridges
and
tunnels
may
begin
to
look
like
an
attractive
alternative.
as
this
court
said
in
el
paso,
when
you
get
to
the
subject
of
means,
that’s
exactly
the
kind
of
question
as
to
which
the
legislature
has
to
have
the
widest
possible
discretion.
for
this
court
to
put
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
condition
where
it
has
to
choose
whether
to
close
those
bridges
and
tunnels
or
let
the
local
business
close
up
for
certain
number
of
days,
is
i
respectfully
submit
that
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
let
me
say
two
things
about
that
mr.
justice
white.
first,
i
think
it
is
not
of
that
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
in
the
very
earliest
days,
the
bonds
were
a
single
project.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
but
they
failed
and
that’s
why
this
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
there
is
no
project
of
the
port
authority
for
which
it
would
have
been
possible
to
sell
bonds
if
it
were
not
supported
by
the
others.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
unless
the
states
guarantee.
but
it
is
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
i’m
afraid
to
say
it
wasn’t
feasible
and
it
is
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
no
question
that
the
bondholders
would’ve
been
happier
had
the
states
done
it
that
way.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
in
both
states,
it
would
require
public
referendum
and
you
would
have
problems
with
debt
limitation
clauses.
moreover,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
port
district
is
not
a
state
so
that
in
each
referendum,
the
citizens
voting
from
outside
the
port
district
would
be
being
asked
to
increase
their
taxes
in
order
to
pay
for
mass
transit
in
the
port
district
while
it
is
running
annual
revenues
that
grow
every
year
and
reserves
that
grow
every
year.
it
does
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
the
leverage
is
extraordinary
by
the
commitment
of
$12
million
in
increased
tolls.
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
so
far
been
promised
to
$157
million
by
the
department
of
transportation
for
the
path
plainfield
extension
and
it
has
received
permission
to
use
another
$70
million
for
federal
highway
funds.
now,
that
$12
million
is
already
entailed.
it
is
not
coming
from
bondholders,
it
is
coming
from
drivers.
the
returns
on
those
tolls,
as
mr.
milburn
indicated,
are
an
increase
of
$40
million
a
year.
so,
that
by
being
able
to
apply
those
tolls,
it
will
now
be
possible
the
dot
has
signed
off
on
that
grant,
provided
the
local
share
is
committed,
and
the
local
share
has
by
agreement
between
new
jersey
and
the
port
authority
been
divided
between
them.
if
the
port
authority
cannot
put
it
up
its
share
which
is
debt
service
of
$12
million
a
year,
the
project
will
fail.
the
irony
is
that
the
project
is
intended
to
serve
newark
airport.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
yes,
sir!
you
will
get
an
extension
of
the
path
railroad
from
newark
to
the
city
of
elizabeth,
new
jersey
and
newark
airport,
the
area
of
newark
airport.
the
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
as
soon
as
this
litigation
is
concluded.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
no!
it
will
begun.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
they
have
talked
about
two
to
four-year
construction
period.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
i
don’t
know
but
the
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
yes.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
but
it’s
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
will
not
pay
for
itself
but
the
port
authority
is
not
being
stuck
with
the
deficit.
they
are
in
this
to
the
tune
of
$12
million
a
year
and
they
have
already
received
far
more
than
that
from
the
toll
rise.
and
they
will
continue
to
receive
far
more
than
that
from
the
toll
rise.
mr.
milburn
talked
about
the
rising
deficits
of
the
path
railroad
in
every
year
in
which
those
deficits
went
up,
so
did
the
revenues
and
reserves
of
the
port
authority.
it
has
absorbed
every
nickel
of
those
reserves
--
of
those
deficits.
it
has
absorbed
every
nickel
of
the
cost
overruns
on
the
world
trade
center.
it
lived
with
the
fuel
crisis,
hurting
its
airport,
bridge,
and
tunnel
business.
and
every
year,
its
revenues
and
reserves
rose
and
it
passed
the
quarter
of
a
billion
dollar
mark
last
year
in
reserves
that
have
not
been
called
upon.
that
is
to
say,
there
is
approximately
$260
million
in
reserves
belonging
to
the
port
authority
that
are
not
going
to
have
to
be
look
to
for
support
of
anything
because
the
annual
revenues
of
the
port
authority
also
continue
to
grow
and
they
are
used
to
pay
these
deficits
with
enough
leftover,
so
that
each
year
the
reserves
grow
again.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
i
think
this
court's
cases
are
clear
on
the
point.
where
the
into
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
not
no.
not
exactly
like
this.
but
there
have
been
many
cases
that
make
it
clear
that
promises
whether
by
the
state
or
by
private
party
maybe
modified
depending
on
the
ends
to
be
served
and
on
the
degree
of
damage
done.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
it’s
not
enough
to
be
in
the
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
no,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
it
has
to
be
to
serve
a
matter
of
real
consequence,
now
where
that
line
is.
it
is
obvious
the
matter
of
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
not
like
this.
i
begun
by
saying
it
and
it
was
not
a
rhetorical
flourish
that
you
haven’t
had
a
case
as
important
as
this.
i
mean,
this
is
the
living
and
breathing
of
the
citizens
of
two
states,
the
economic
survival
of
their
institutions
in
the
face
of
an
energy
crisis.
these
are
consequences
that
are
greater
than
any
of
those,
any
previous
contract
cases
put
before
this
court.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
mr.
chief
justice,
the
evidence
in
this
case
indicates
that
it
does
not.
just
last
month,
the
port
authority
sold
$50
million
worth
of
bonds
at
7%
coupon.
with
this
case
pending
before
this
court,
the
state
having
repealed
the
covenant,
that
is
three-eighths
of
a
point
higher
then
the
35th
series
of
port
authority
bonds
sold
for,
with
the
covenant
in
effect
and
it
sold
at
a
time
when
every
bond
dealer
that
tries
to
sell
a
security
with
the
name
new
york
on
it,
finds
himself
with
a
drug.
so,
that
the
notion
that
these
record
supports
the
proposition
that
the
municipal
bond
market
will
be
destroyed
or
even
seriously
impaired
by
permitting
states
to
take
measures
that
meet
two
conditions.
one,
the
pursuit
of
an
important
public
purpose
and
two,
no
damage!
the
--
one
of
the
witnesses
for
the
plaintiff
below
was
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
murphy
and
he
is
an
officer
of
barr
brothers.
and
barr
brothers
is
--
he
was
offered
to
tell
us
about
the
bond
market
too
and
barr
brothers
has
announced
as
follows,
this
appears
at
pages
422
to
423
of
the
appendix,
“whether
or
not
the
port
authority
ever
gets
involve
in
mass
transit,
we
feel
it
continues
to
be
one
of
the
finest
revenue
credits
in
the
country,
amply
protected
by
the
basic
bond
resolution,
excellent
management,
and
some
highly
profitable
monopolistic
facilities
that
can
more
than
carry
a
reasonable
amount
of
mass
transit,”
particularly
with
the
recent
toll
increases
that
was
issued
after
the
trial
court
decision.
“there’s
no
risk
of
default,
nobody
has
claimed
any
risk
of
default.
the
revenues
are
safe,
the
reserves
are
safe.”
there
are
bondholder
protections
here
that
the
general
solicitor
of
the
port
authority
described
as
precluded
any
assumption
of
mass
transit
responsibilities
that
would
threaten
the
bondholders.
our
friends
profess
puzzlement
as
to
how
we
can
say
that
the
covenant
is
an
impediment
to
rational
planning
and
at
the
same
time
that
its
repeal
will
not
hurt
bondholders
by
freeing
up
resources.
the
answer
is
that
the
other
bondholder
protections
save
the
bondholders
from
any
project
that
could
really
threaten
their
security.
all
the
covenant
does
is
prevent
projects
that
are
threatening.
it
bans
categorical,
and
therefore,
it
prevents
even
a
project
that
wouldn’t
hurt.
there's
no
way
that
the
port
authority
can
pick
up
a
mass
transit
project
that
would
threaten
security
of
bondholders.
and
that
was
the
opinion
of
mr.
goldberg
in
1961
before
the
adoption
of
the
covenant
and
not
made
in
the
context
in
which
he
was
peddling
bonds.
that
was
a
talk
he
gave
to
port
authority
insiders
and
it
was
later
published
three
years
later
because
it
was
regarded
as
such
a
fine
statement
of
the
financial
status
of
the
port
authority.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
on
this
record,
if
that
were
the
only
change,
i
would
think
we
should
still
win
it.
the
reason
being
that
on
the
day
of
the
repeal
--
on
the
day
governor
burn
signed
repeal,
the
plaintiff
held
a
press
conference
and
savaged
these
bonds,
and
said
they
have
been
gravely
impaired.
the
story
was
reported
in
the
wall
street
journal,
in
new
york
times
and
every
jersey
newspaper
coming
out
weekly
or
daily.
now,
if
anything
is
calculated
to
obscure
the
probative
effect
of
the
market
reaction,
that
surely
is
the
plaintiff
is
the
largest
holder
of
these
bonds
and
to
say
that
they
had
been
severely
damaged
would
clearly
cause
some
drop
in
the
market
and
it
did.
the
bonds
did
go
down.
mr.
milburn
has
suggested
to
you
that
something
has
happened
to
the
mass
ports
--
the
bonds
of
the
massachusetts
port
authority
to
make
them
no
longer
comparable.
nothing
has
happen
to
those
bonds
except
that
that
original
shake
out,
attributable
we
think
to
the
united
states
trust
companies
damaging
these
bonds
improved
with
the
passage
of
the
time,
statements
like
barr
brothers,
the
renewal
of
the
of
the
same
a
rating
by
moody’s
and
standard
&
poor’s
that
they
had
always
given
it,
after
that
initial
savaging,
people
had
a
chance
take
a
look
into
and
do
an
evaluation
and
what
they
found
out
was
that
these
bonds
are
terrific.
moreover,
the
briefs
tell
you
that
there's
a
short-term
effect
to
that
recovery.
that
recovery
has
now
been
in
effect
for
two
years.
the
mass
ports
and
new
york
ports
last
week
were
selling
within
a
half
a
point
of
each
other.
so,
that
there's
no
damage
in
the
market,
there's
no
damage
in
the
light
of
moody’s
and
standards
&
poor’s
--
the
company
that
employs,
one
of
the
plaintiff’s
witnesses
says
it
is
terrific.
there's
nothing
to
fear,
go
out
and
buy
it.
there's
no
damage
and
all
those
opinions,
and
those
are
opinions
that
count
that
people
are
acting
on
not
testimony
and
litigation.
all
those
opinions
are
supported
by
the
documents
themselves
as
when
one
looks
at
those
bond
covenants.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
they
can’t
loose
more
at
this
time
and
than
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
that’s
absolutely
correct
your
honor,
but
lots
of
other
projects
are
and
these
enterprises
always
operated
in
number
of
deficit
facilities,
losing
substantial
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
that’s
not
true,
your
honor.
one
of
the
fascinating
things
is
their
peculiar
belief
that
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
the
reason
--
i
saw
a
recent
report
that
suggested
it
isn’t
doing
so
well
but
of
course
it
wasn’t
running
very
well
either.
everybody
agrees
that
the
path
is
a
very
well
run
railroad.
but
to
come
back
to
mr.
justice
stevens’
question
earlier
about
--
what
the
opinions
suggests
about
what
kinds
of
modifications
are
permissible?
the
modifications
that
have
typically
been
permitted
had
been
those
that
leave
the
basic
obligation
intact
and
that
where
a
state
deprives
the
bondholders’
principal
or
his
interest
that
then
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
legislation
may
well
be
struck
down,
though
even
their
given
sufficient
conditions
and
there
are
some
of
the
emergency
cases
committed,
there's
no
requirement
in
this
court’s
opinions
that
would
be
an
emergency.
viex,
el
paso,
gelfert,
slaughter
house
cases,
any
number
of
cases
that
have
upheld
state
repudiation
and
their
promises
in
the
absence
of
an
emergency.
but
where
the
repudiation
in
the
bond
context
involves
in
actual
taking
away
of
the
principal
or
interest,
then
it
seems
to
me
this
court
is
going
to
take
a
much
closer
look
--
it
should
take
a
much
closer
look
at
the
justification
and
come
to
the
case
where
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
ah.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
it
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
you
understand
why
it
is
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
if
there
is
a
material
change
in
the
risk,
it
is
at
that
point
of
the
court
must
look
to
the
justification
for
the
action
taken
and
are
the
ends
sufficiently
important.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
i
would
give
great
weight
to
the
assessments
of
the
security’s
rating
agencies,
standard
&
poor’s
and
moody’s,
barr
brothers
assessment,
and
i
believe
the
court
can
look
at
the
bond
covenants
themselves
and
see
that
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
except
that
it’s
very
important
to
remember
that
these
are
bonds
that
--
whose
temporary
diminish
in
market
value
even
in
the
early
part
of
the
days
following
the
appeal,
those
--
that
kind
of
loss
is
only
a
temporary
loss
in
liquidity
and
if
there's
anything
that
this
court
has
upheld
when
there
have
been
valid
justifications,
it’s
a
temporary
loss
in
the
liquidity.
that’s
blaisdell,
that’s
viex
and
others.
as
long
as
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
i
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
but
it
is
a
very
hypothetical
risk,
your
honor.
the
arrangement
between
the
court
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
oh,
that
it
is
possible.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
yes,
but
this
still
does
not
contemplate
the
port
authority
paying
operating
deficits.
the
arrangements
that
have
been
made
will
use
the
port
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
the
repealer
would,
but
the
state
legislation
and
the
implementing
administrative
actions
have
provided
that
the
port
authority
is
responsible
only
for
the
debt
service
unknowable
defined
figures
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
conceivably
yes,
your
honor.
although,
the
port
authority
has
on
many
occasions
made
its
own
promises
to
bondholders
without
spending
through.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well
again,
i
come
back
to
your
question
and
that
is,
“does
it
have
an
obligation
to
keep
them
when
nothing
is
at
risk
or
very
little
is
at
risk.
it
does
--
not
only
does
it
have
an
obligation
to
keep
them,
it
has
an
obligation
that
has
been
quite,
taken
quite
seriously
by
the
courts
of
both
new
york
and
new
jersey.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
they
can’t
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
that’s
right.
and
both
states
must
have
it
since
it’s
a
by
state
agency.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
no,
but
we
can
say
that
the
chances
of
success
are
very
dim
indeed.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
they
haven't
your
honor.
it
is
the
voters
that
will
have
to
choose
to
vote
to
support
projects
that
are
already
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
new
york
has
had
a
transportation
bond
issue
defeated
and
so
has
new
jersey.
the
difficulty
in
trying
it
now
is
of
course
that
the
pending
projects
will
be
scrapped
and
further
delay,
further
cost
escalation
and
again,
i
come
back
to
the
statement
in
el
paso
that
states
that
where
you
have
legitimate
public
ends,
the
choice
of
means
is
one
is
to
which
this
court
would
give
wide
latitude
to
the
legislatures.
the
judgment
whether
to
hold
referendum
on
support
for
the
addition
to
the
port
authority
facilities,
it
seems
to
me
as
one
at
the
outcome
of
which
is
almost
knowable.
it
is
hard
like
that
people
of
two
states
will
defeat
those
referendum,
knowing
as
cannot
be
denied,
it
hasn’t
been
denied,
but
the
port
authority’s
resources
are
ample
to
undertake
that
without
a
ripple.
i
mean,
the
port
authority
has
the
continuing
revenue
from
its
other
facilities
that
can
support
that
without
the
least
but
of
difficulty.
and
as
this
court
knows
that
is
not
true
of
the
ability
to
borrow
of
new
york
or
new
york
state
at
this
time.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
oh,
i
have
no
doubt
your
honor
that
they
don’t
like
it.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
i’ll
tell
you
the
fact
is
that
when
the
covenant
hasn’t
been
there,
they
have
bought
the
bonds.
that
is
to
say
the
last
series
to
be
sold
before
the
covenant
was
sold
in
january
1962.
the
previous
year,
the
new
york
state
legislature
had
directed
the
port
authority
to
take
over
the
hudson
and
the
manhattan.
that
was
the
fearful
take
over.
those
bonds
went
off
without
a
hitch
on
then
prevailing
interest
rates.
when
the
covenant
was
repealed
prospectively,
the
port
authority
--
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
what
i’m
suggesting
here,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
to
your
honor
is
that
the
perception
of
purchases
before
and
after
the,
before
adoption
of
the
covenant
and
after
repeal
was
that
they
needed
no
protection
from
such
a
risk.
the
port
authority’s
other
bondholder
protections
would
take
care
of
them
and
riding
in
to
draw
inference
that
that
kind
of
perception
of
the
risks
is
an
accurate
one
on
which
they
betting.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
bondholders
who
bought
during
the
period
of
the
covenant
would
have
bought
without
the
covenant.
what
we
do
know
is
those
who
bought
before
bought
without
and
then
those
who
bought
after
bought
without.
mr.
michael
i.
sovern
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
really
am
relying
very
heavily
on
the
plaintiff's
own
witnesses
and
on
plaintiff's
counsel
who
swore
that
95%
of
the
bondholders
identities
were
unknown
to
the
port
authority,
so
that
the
burden
there
really
was
assumed
to
be
that
the
one
that
couldn’t
be
met.
the
court
reaches
the
question
of
the
impermanent
contract
of
course
only
if
it
first
finds
that
there
was
a
contract
and
we
have
urged
two
grounds
for
maintaining
that
there
was
no
contract.
one,
the
voidability
of
an
amendment
of
an
interstate
compact
without
congressional
consent
and
the
other,
the
preemption
of
the
covenant
via
federal
enactments
whose
full
effectuation
--
it
impeded
naturally
if
the
court
is
moved
by
either
of
those
arguments.
it
could
quite
logically
take
then
instead
of
the
impairment
question.
courts
below
shows
to
address
the
impairment
question
and
not
the
compact
questions.
and
now,
to
come
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
covenant,
we
find
it
at
a
time
when
it’s
desired
to
discourage
auto
traffic
and
increase
mass
transit.
we
find
that
the
public
agency
responsible
for
coordinating
the
region’s
transportation
entrusted
by
the
states
with
the
highly
profitable
monopoly
of
bridges
and
tunnels
could
contribute
to
the
area’s
transportation
needs
only
because
of
the
covenant
by
further
support
of
the
internal
combustion
engine.
the
repeal
of
the
covenant
makes
it
possible
to
take
a
more
balanced
approach
to
those
needs
and
we’ve
talked
about
the
path
plainfield
project.
to
sum
up,
the
plaintiff
admits
at
page
66
of
the
its
brief
that,
if
it
can
be
said
in
the
case
at
bar
that
the
ends
to
the
accomplished
or
improvement
in
mass
transit,
decrease
in
air
pollution
and
conservation
of
energy,
it
must
be
granted
that
they
are
legitimate.
the
ends
are
legitimate,
repeals
serve
them,
no
damage
has
been
proved,
this
is
a
classic
case
of
proper
use
of
the
state’s
police
power.
thank
you,
your
honors.
