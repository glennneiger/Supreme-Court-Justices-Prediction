why
do
you
call
his
interest
an
unbargained
for
one?
justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
sovern,
supposing
that
immediately
after
the
repeal
of
the
covenant,
the
value
of
these
--
the
market
value
of
these
bonds
had
dropped
to
50%
of
what
they
had
been
immediately
before,
you
would
obviously
have
a
much
worse
case
than
you
do
now.
would
you
think
you
would
loose
it
or
do
you
think
you
might
still
be
able
to
win
it?
