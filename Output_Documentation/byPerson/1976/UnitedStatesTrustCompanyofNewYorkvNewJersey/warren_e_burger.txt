we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
trust
company
against
new
jersey
and
others.
mr.
milburn,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
page
16?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nothing
unique
about
that
in
public
enterprise?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
right
and
it
still
goes
on
and
will.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
something
like
the
minnesota
mortgage
moratorium?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
in
the
circumstances
which
will
enlarge
the
time
of
each
side
five
minutes,
so
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
take
that
into
account.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
want
to
save
--
how
much
do
you
want
to
save
for
rebuttal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
you
may
reserve
that
for
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sovern.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
have
any
express,
are
there
any
express
assurances
there
about
the
malodorous
factors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
just
so
that
it
was
an
incident
of
running
a
slaughter
house
in
those
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
i
know,
but
was
there
any
grant?
was
it
articulated
there
that
they
could
go
on
without
any
restraint
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
mr.
sovern
that
closing
the
bridges
down
and
doing
some
of
these
other
things
that
were
suggested
by
justice
stevens
were
politically
unpalatable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
voices
of
those
people
would
be
heard
more
widely
than
the
voices
of
the
bondholders
in
the
public
arena,
wouldn’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
going
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
capacity
of
the
governments
at
all
levels
to
borrow
money,
isn’t
it
also?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
milburn,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-1687,
united
states
trust
company
against
new
jersey
and
others
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.

justice
warren

burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
