mr.
milburn,
has
the
covenant
been
repealed
by
new
york
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whole
state,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
new
york
repeal
was
litigated
in
the
new
york
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
that’s
still
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
milburn
before
you
use
all
your
time,
be
sure
to
discuss
el
paso,
the
el
paso
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sovern,
how
does
the
repealer
of
the
1962
covenant
could
change
the
air
quality
in
new
jersey?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
only
method
of
limiting
the
number
vehicles
across
the
bridge
to
increase
the
fare?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
the
only
consequence
in
terms
of
air
quality,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
there
other
methods
of
--
just
if
you
concentrate
in
a
one
feature
limiting
the
amount
of
traffic
coming
across
the
bridge,
are
there
any
ways
that
that
could
be
done
without
tampering
at
all
with
the
new
york
port
authority,
with
the
bondholder
structure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
close
the
bridge
for
a
couple
of
hours
a
day?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
of
an
attempt
to
get
more
limited
change
in
the
terms
of
the
bond
in
venture
to
just
permit
that
change
without
repealing
the
entire
covenant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
have
a
procedure
for
getting
consent
to
changes,
isn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don’t
think
the
bondholders
would
have
consented
to
permission
to
increase
the
toll?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
that
change
--
?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
the
change
he
was
discussing,
one
that
would
permit
investment
in
the
mass
transit
or
merely
a
change
in
the
toll?
when
i
said
--
does
that
really
be
--
is
that
testimony
responsive
to
the
question
that
i
was
asking
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
the
reason
--
let
me
just
tie
it.
i
don’t
want
to
be
obtuse
and
i
may
not
be
following
you,
but
as
i
understand
their
argument,
they
say
the
objection
to
the
repealer
is
that
it
will
permit
the
port
authority
to
make
investments
in
mass
transits
which
are
deficit
operation,
you
lose
lots
of
money.
and
you
say,
“well,
we
want
to
do
that
because
we
want
to
raise
the
tolls
on
the
bridges”
and
i'm
asking
you,
you,
couldn’t
if
you
have
made
an
amendment
that
would’ve
permitted
you
to
raise
the
tolls
on
the
bridges,
without
also
permitting
you
to
go
under
mass
transit
facility
operation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
still
raising
cap
would
be
a
device
for
cutting
down
on
air
pollution
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
which
i
thought
you
were
saying
was
the
reason
for
this
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sovern,
if
i
might
interrupt
you.
do
you
think
that
the
section
10
of
article
1
of
the
federal
constitution
which
contains
the
constitutional
provision
we’re
talking
about
in
this
case,
imposes
any
restriction
at
all
on
the
power
of
the
port
authority
that
legislates
the
two
states
to
withdraw
from
any
commitment
when
it
sees
it,
would
it
be
advantageous
in
the
financial
sense
to
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
--
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
what
when
it
does
impose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
never
been
long
quite
like
this,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
assume
every
change
that
they
would
seek
to
make
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
state
and
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
enough,
so
they
can
make
any
change
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
paul
stevens
you’re
dealing
with
a
$100
million
or
a
$100
billion,
it’s
always
going
to
be
real
consequences,
isn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don’t
think
something
that
materially
changed
the
risk
would
be
within
that
definition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
risk
of
the
default?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
of
course
argue,
there's
no
material
change.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
assuming
that
we
felt
the
other
way
on
that
particular
problem,
would
it
be
within
the
constitutional
provision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
judge
where
there
is
material
change
in
the
risk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
that
really
boils
down
to
the
question
of
market
values
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
did
imply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
the
change
in
the
risk
here
is
not
an
immediate
risk.
it’s
rather
the
risk
that
after
the
several
years
that
it
required
to
build
the
extension
of
the
railroad,
you
finally
get
it
done
but
did
on
note
one
to
know,
but
then
you
start
losing
larger
sums
of
money
that
we’ve
anticipated
instead
of
being
a
$5
million
deficit,
it
is
a
$100
million
deficit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it’s
the
kind
of
risk
that
i
suppose
is
at
stake
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn’t
there
some
factual
basis
for
something
that
it
could
happen?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don’t
you
have
experience
with
this
one
railroad
that
you
taken
over
that
its
losses
were
much
greater
than
anticipated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
covenant
would
permit
you
to
do
so
and
the
repealer
would
permit
you
to
do
so,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
various
actions
could
be
change
if
things
get
a
little
worse
and
you
need
more
money
some
place
else,
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
want
the
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
obligation
to
keep
them
apparently?
