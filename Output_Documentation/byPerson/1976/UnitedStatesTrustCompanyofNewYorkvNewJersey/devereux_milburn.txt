mr.
devereux
milburn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
from
the
superior
court,
bergen
county,
new
jersey,
a
decision
by
judge
gilman,
appealed
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
affirmed
largely
on
the
opinion
of
judge
gilman.
we
filed
a
jurisdictional
statement
with
this
court,
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
and
here
we
are.
let
me
say
at
the
beginning
before
i
start
the
statement
of
facts.
we
have
a
stipulation
among
counsel
of
387
pages
plus
exhibits.
of
all
the
briefs,
at
least
half
are
devoted
to
facts
and
they
are
lengthy,
according
to
new
standards,
too
lengthy.
however,
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
review
the
facts.
i
would
then
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
emergency
as
it
applies
to
the
impairment
of
contracts.
i
would
then
like
to
discuss
the
reliance
of
bondholders
upon
the
1962
covenant
and
then
the
protection
afforded
to
bondholders
by
the
1962
covenant.
the
facts
very
briefly
are
that
the
subject
after
the
report
of
a
commission
in
1921
a
compact
was
entered
into
between
new
jersey
and
new
york
establishing
the
port
authority.
in
1922,
a
comprehensive
plan
was
adopted,
both
of
those
have
the
consent
of
congress.
in
the
comprehensive
plan,
i
think
without
question,
there
was
no
mention
of
passenger
traffic.
the
port
authority
was
conceived
to
handle
the
freight
problem
in
the
port
district.
things
went
along
quietly
until
about
1927
and
a
legislation
was
passed
requiring
the
port
authority
to
take
over
the
passenger
mass
transit
problem.
this
legislation
was
vetoed
by
governor
smith
and
i
might
add
that
governor
smith
was
an
architect
of
the
compact
and
of
the
comprehensive
plan
and
he
pointed
out
on
his
veto
message
that
the
moving
of
freight
was
a
primary,
the
soul
--
no,
i
won’t
say
the
soul,
but
the
primary
and
the
most
important
job
for
the
port
authority
and
the
one
for
which
they
were
created.
the
port
authority
thrives
although
the
mass
transit
problem
was
chronic.
in
1959,
there
was
a
legislative
finding
out
of
a
joint
assembly
committee
of
the
new
jersey
legislature.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
page
16
of
appellee’s
brief
and
page
seven
of
our
reply
brief.
page
seven
of
our
reply
brief
sets
out
this
finding
a
little
more
completely
shall
we
say
than
the
brief
of
appellee.
mr.
devereux
milburn
seven
of
our
reply
briefs.
16
of
appellee's
brief,
the
blue
one
and
7
of
our
brief.
it
says
that
no
doubt,
the
port
authority
could
undertake
an
activity
which
would
involve
a
deficit
even
a
pendent
one.
if
you’re
reading
the
appellee’s
brief,
that’s
where
it
stops
with
a
period.
but
i
would
like
to
just
continue
what’s
in
our
brief.
it
could
only
do
so
if
there
was
real
assurance
that
the
size
of
the
deficit
would
be
such
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
its
ability
to
absorb
it,
an
important
addition.
now,
nothing
came
of
that,
but
in
1959,
there
were
rumblings
about
the
h&m,
the
hudson
tubes.
the
rumblings
was
such
that
were
cause
by
the
fact
that
a
district
court
had
just
decided
that
the
hudson
tubes
could
continue
and
gave
them
enough
cash
for
two
years.
it
was
obvious
something
had
to
be
done
and
the
port
authority
was
looked
to
and
it
was
suggested
to
them.
now,
the
port
authority
was
not
unused
to
deficits.
ever
since
1931
and
the
general
reserve
fund,
the
port
authority
had
gone
on
a
pooling
paces.
it
took
its
revenues
and
it
took
its
deficits
and
then
mixed
them
all
together,
but
we
are
talking
about
deficits.
let
me
point
out
that,
for
instance
that
in
1962,
the
biggest
deficit
we’re
talking
about
was
$500,000.00
for
the
newark
airport.
now,
all
these
deficits
came
from
facilities
which
were
expected
to
make
money
and
most
of
them
didn't.
it
took
a
long
time
for
some
of
them,
but
they
all,
except
with
the
one
or
two
minor
exceptions
made
money
and
the
major
deficit
in
1962
was
$529,000.00.
so,
along
comes
the
h&m,
and
what
it
its
projective
deficit,
$5
million,
a
completely
different
bargain.
now,
$5
million
was
expected
to
level
out
at
$6,725,000.00
over
of
a
period
of
time.
there
are
two
fallacies.
it
didn’t
level
out
at
$6
million.
it
leveled
out,
well
to
take
1973,
at
$18
million
operating
deficit
plus
$7
or
more
million
debt
service
or
$25
to
$28
million.
now,
that
is
important
because
it
shows
how
wrong
people
can
be
when
they
project
deficits
and
as
you
will
see
that
becomes
very
important
later.
mr.
devereux
milburn
no
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
now,
with
this
deficit,
looking
the
investors
in
the
face,
a
new
deficit,
a
completely
different
concept
of
$5
million
to
$6
million,
we
are
told
with
that
austin
toven
went
out
and
beat
up
investment
consent.
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
beat
up
investment
consent
when
this
type
of
operation,
which
you’re
not
used
to
and
which
you
don’t
want
is
face-to-face
with
you.
now,
the
1962
covenant
isn’t
very
long,
but
what
it
provides
is
that
if
you
take
over
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
no
sir.
this
is
1961
when
he
was
beating
up
the
investor
consent
for
that
$6
million
deficit.
the
1962
covenant,
basically
what
it
said
was
you
take
h&m
and
you
don’t
have
to
take
anymore
railroad
deficits.
there
were
limitations,
but
we’ve
all
agree
that
the
cause
of
the
path
deficit
at
the
moment,
does
no
room
for
anymore
mass
transit
enterprises
because
they
are
all
deficit
and
we’ve
used
up
the
limitations
which
were
contained
in
the
covenant.
the
covenant
was
passed,
the
investments
were
made
and
things
were
quite
until
1971,
and
$1,200,000,000.00
worth
of
bonds
were
sold
during
that
period
with
the
covenant
in
effect.
in
1971,
there
was
a
hearing
on
our
same
old
favorite
subject
in
the
port
takeover,
mass
transit.
in
1972,
there
were
further
hearings
and
new
york
repealed
the
covenant
and
governor
rockefeller
signed
it.
this
was
too
much
for
new
jersey.
they
thought
that
it
was
an
unconstitutional
act
and
they
would
not
go
along.
in
1973,
we
had
more
hearings
and
finally,
what
happened
was,
there
was
a
prospective
repeal
of
the
covenant
because
it
was
thought
that
a
retroactive
appeal
would
be
unconstitutional.
included
in
that
legislation
was
the
original
path
triborough-kennedy
newark
link.
now,
in
1974,
the
covenant
was
repealed
without
any
further
legislative
hearing.
we
can
guess
why
it
was
repealed
and
we
can
guess
right
or
we
can
guess
wrong,
we
do
not
know
why
it
was
repealed.
we
do
know
this,
however,
built
into
the
covenant,
there
is
a
provision
for
changing
it,
from
modifying
it
and
that
provision
calls
for
the
consent
of
two-thirds
of
the
bondholders.
this
may
sound
like
a
difficult
proposition,
but
i
might
remind
the
court
that
it
was
done
in
the
triborough
bridge
authority
case
where
the
bondholders
can
set
them.
they
got
an
extra
quarter
of
a
point
and
they
put
out
something
like
$305
million
which
was
applied
to
mass
transit.
no
effort
was
made
to
contact
the
bondholders.
i
understand,
it
would
be
absolutely
impossible
to
contact
them,
but
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
understand
that
from
being
sovereign
and
from
nobody
else.
i
do
not
know
why
they
didn’t
try,
i
know
they
didn’t
try.
now,
we
have
heard,
we’ve
read
in
the
briefs,
a
great
deal
of
$40
million
which
is
going
to
be
realized
from
an
increase
in
the
fares
over
port
authority
facilities,
george
washington
bridge,
in
particular
they
were
doubled.
we
are
not
sure
they‘re
going
to
stay
double
because
of
the
bridge
act
of
1906
and
because
there
are
hearings,
and
because
there
is
certain
amount
of
litigation.
but
right
at
the
moment,
they
are
doubled,
and
it
is
anticipated
if
they
hold
they
would
give
out
$40
million.
we
are
told
by
appellees,
this
$40
million
would
go
to
mass
transit.
it
said
it
was
going
to
mass
transit
and
the
paraphernalia
went
along
with
the
toll
rate,
but
let
me
ask
you
this,
how
can
it
go
to
mass
transit?
it
belongs
to
the
bondholders
under
the
rate
schedule,
under
the
rate
agreement.
it
doesn’t
just
go
$40
million
to
mass
transit.
it
goes
into
the
path
and
what
does
that
mean?
it
means
that
between
1974
and
1975
the
surplus
of
the
port
authority
after
a
mandatory
provision
for
the
retirement
of
two
years
of
debt
service
amounted
to
$296,000.00.
where
did
the
$40
million
go?
it
went
to
increased
expenses
of
the
port
authority.
there
is
no
$40
million
that
we’re
talking
about.
that
goes
into
the
bondholders
path
and
what
came
out
was
$296,000.00.
if
there
is
an
overflow
from
or
flow
through
of
the
$40
million,
it
can
go
to
mass
transit,
but
the
flow
through
we’re
talking
about
is
$296,000.00
which
does
not
deal
much
with
mass
transit.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes.
it
had
to
be.
mr.
devereux
milburn
by
a
state
action,
yes,
sir.
they
did
it
both
in
the
--
i
believe
sir
in
1974
months
apart.
mr.
devereux
milburn
it
has
been
litigated.
mr.
devereux
milburn
there’s
been
a
complaint
and
an
answer,
and
a
lot
of
papers
prepared,
but
if
you
ask
me
why
we
haven’t
proceeded
immediately,
i'll
give
you
the
answer;
we
were
waiting
for
the
flushing
bank
case
to
come
down
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
the
argument
was
september
8th,
we
haven’t
had
the
decision
and
i
have
to
confess
i’m
surprised
we
haven’t
had
it,
but
depending
on
that
simply
using
that
in
our
papers
we
will
proceed
in
the
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
big
mack.
now,
the
new
york
notes
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
new
york
notes
it
were
extended
and
somebody
sued
and
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
--
it’s
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
mr.
devereux
milburn
the
effect
on
the
market
was
for
a
period
of
eight
months.
there
was
a
very
decided
drop
and
we
used
the
mass
ports
as
a
comparison
and
it
showed
a
decided-drop
for
eight
months
and
then
a
basic
return
and
leveling
off.
i
can
say
in
that
connection
that
prior
the
repeal
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
at
about
the
same
as
same
spread.
prior
the
repeal
the
port
authorities
in
new
york
were
of
much
finer
bond
than
mass
ports.
after
repeal,
they
have
never
been
a
finer
bond
than
mass
ports.
now
i
have
to
admit
that
when
we
pick
mass
ports,
we
pick
a
limit.
there
was
fine
for
that
short
period
after
appeal.
but
all
of
sudden
mass
ports
got
mixed
up
and
political
controversy
in
massachusetts
where
the
governor
tried
to
take
over
the
commissioners
and
make
their
term
co-terminus
with
his,
and
in
other
words,
it
became
a
political
football
and
that
affected
the
market.
the
banks
blew
a
fuse,
if
you
will,
and
just
to
complain
in
the
market,
their
market
reacted
accordingly,
so
we
picked
the
wrong
one.
we
could
not
predict
that,
but
during
before
that
and
during
the
eight-month
period,
there
was
a
decided-drop
in
the
secondary
market.
now,
we
admit
that
the
states
have
another
advocated
police
power.
we’ve
heard
that
time
and
time
again
and
we
admit
its
there
to
take
lotteries,
prohibition,
things
like
that
to
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
even
if
--
well,
in
this
--
may
i
say
this.
i
do
not
admit
that
there
has
ever
been
a
case
where
a
contract
in
a
form
of
a
statute
made
by
a
state
or
two
sovereign
states
with
its
creditors
made
to
induce
investment,
bargained
for
and
relied
upon
has
ever
been
reputed
and
sustained
in
the
courts.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
almost
did,
i
think
sir.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
may
have
misled
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
per
se
no.
i
think
that
that’s
--
it
is
possible
that
circumstances
could
exist
where
the
state
can
do
anything.
mr.
devereux
milburn
this
case
i
think
is
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
do
sir
and
if
a
--
would
you
like
to
discuss
el
paso?
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
wish
you
will
hear
bring
it
alive.
mr.
devereux
milburn
we’re
going
to
discuss
el
paso,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
devereux
milburn
[laughter]
no,
sir.
that’s
part
of
our
pool.[laughter]
that
takes
care
of
some
of
the
deficits
including
path.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
holland
tunnel
was
thrown
in
to
make
a
pool
work
because
at
that
time
everybody
is
going
busted
around
1931
and
1932
including
the
port
authority
and
the
pool
wasn’t
working
because
of
a
deficit
pool
and
the
state's
put
in
the
holland
tunnel
and
that
brought
it
up
over.
and
that’s
one
of
our
pride
and
joys
after
the
george
washington
bridge.
now,
what
justifies
the
use
of
the
police
power?
in
such
a
case
as
we
have
here,
if
it
can
be
justified
and
i
say,
that
blaisdell
and
its
progeny
established
that
it
must
be
an
emergency.
now,
blaisdell
had
a
real
emergency.
they
have
mobs
in
the
middle
west.
they
have
the
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
this
was
it,
sir.
yes,
that
was
the
statute
in
blaisdell
and
there
were
riots
and
there
were
mobs
and
something
had
to
be
done.
the
statute
was
passed
and
mr.
justice
hughes’
opinion
in
that
case
refers
again
and
again,
and
again
to
emergency.
he
also
refers
to
temporary.
now,
the
appellees
say
in
their
case
that
an
emergency
is
not
necessary.
no
case
that
i
can
find
has
ever
so
held,
gelfert
doesn’t
which
is
cited
by
appellees.
in
gelfert,
the
contract
was
not
covered
by
the
contract
clause
and
that
was
a
result
of
honeyman
against
jacobs.
but
then
they
tried
to
say
because
there
is
no
emergency
declared,
therefore,
the
police
power
doesn’t
work,
therefore,
you’re
covered
by
the
contract
clause
and
the
court
said
nothing
doing
it.
if
you
weren’t
covered
on
honeyman
and
jacobs
just
because
there's
no
emergency,
we’re
not
going
to
slip
you
in
under
that
coverage.
so,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
emergency
declared,
didn’t
help
gelfert
because
it
wasn’t
covered
by
the
contract
clause.
you
don’t
have
a
conflict
between
police
power
and
the
conflict
for
contract
clause
in
gelfert
and
the
other
case’s
name
i
have
difficulty
to
pronounce
it
but
i
call
it
viex
--
v-i-e-x.
there
was
an
emergency,
but
i
think
we’re
directing
--
the
attention
is
directed
in
that
case
against
the
word
temporary.
now,
mr.
justice
hughes
used
temporary
all
the
way
through
his
decision
in
blaisdell.
but
here
the
court
said,
“you
have
a
serious
crisis,
you
had
an
emergency,
you
passed
permanent
legislation.”
now,
let’s
take
a
look
at
it
and
they
took
a
look
at
it,
and
they
said
that
situation
still
exists.
you
still
got
withdrawals
from
your
savings
and
loans.
your
insurance
companies
will
all
be
controlled.
we’re
not
going
to
strike
down
that
because
it
isn’t
temporary.
we
are
going
to
permit
permanent
legislation
because
the
facts
that
gave
rise
to
the
emergency
are
still
there.
now,
why
did
do
appellees
claim
that
they
can
--
that
doesn’t
have
to
be
an
emergency.
in
my
opinion,
it's
because
they
got
a
very
poor
emergency
and
it
would
be
nice
if
you
could
say
they
did
not
have
to
have
one
because
they’ve
got
two
--
that
the
legislature
didn’t
consider
them
as
far
as
we
know.
maybe
they
did,
but
as
far
as
we
know,
as
far
as
there’s
any
legislative
history
that
legislature
did
not
talk
about
energy.
the
legislature
did
not
talk
about
the
environment
and
neither
did
governor
burn
and
neither
did
governor
wilson.
mr.
devereux
milburn
nothing.
mr.
devereux
milburn
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
mr.
justice
white,
it
was
completely
focused.
now,
they
might
have
been
thought.
mr.
devereux
milburn
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
devereux
milburn
but
i
don’t
what
would
made
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
no.
if
you’re
talking
about
energy
and
if
you’re
talking
about
environment,
if
you
say
that
there
was
an
energy
crisis,
we
admit
that.
we
ought
to
have,
to
get
gasoline,
sure
there
was
one,
but
they
didn’t
mention
it.
they
did
not
tie
their
legislation
to
the
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
they,
as
far
as
we
know,
the
object
was
to
put
the
port
authority
in
the
mass
transit.
mr.
devereux
milburn
and
the
mass
transit
is
going
to
--
someday
it's
going
to
have
an
effect
on
environment
and
it's
going
to
have
an
effect
on
energy.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
let’s
reverse
that.
put
mass
transit
on
the
port
authority
it
was
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
absolutely.
mr.
devereux
milburn
the
covenant
basis
had
no
more
error.
no
more
mass
transit
because
it
is
all
deficit
and
we
agree
with
you
and
i
could
put
it
in.
so,
that’s
what
the
covenant
said.
so,
that’s
a
stumbling
line.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
i
can
go
back
to
1921
if
you
like
and
come
all
the
way
through,
there’s
always
been
an
emergency
--
well,
why
is
that
word
because
i
don’t
think
it’s
apt,
it’s
--
it’s
chronic
situation.
emergency
to
me
is
a
house
on
fire.
mr.
devereux
milburn
precisely.
mr.
devereux
milburn
was
to
stop
it
and
--
and
to
get
the
investors
to
put
the
money
in
to
buy
h
&
m
which
is
mass
transit
and
it
is
a
beautiful
piece
of
mass
transit
they
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
comes
with
what?
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
you
call
it
an
emergency,
yes.
then
i
got
to
take
care
of
it
because
of
the
covenant.
no
matter
what
you
call
it,
the
covenant
is
there.
now,
we
say
because
of
the
lack
of
legislative
history
because
we
don’t
really
basically
know
what
emergency
was
--
what
the
emergency
was.
we
would
have
to
say
that
we
don’t
think
that
this
legislation
was
based
on
emergency
and
if
it
was
we
don’t
think
this
is
the
way
to
handle
the
situation.
if
you
come
around
the
corner
then
you
might
have
or
tend
to
see
a
house
on
fire,
what
you
are
going
to
do?
you’ll
put
it
out.
you’re
not
going
to
go
to
your
desk
and
draft
a
legislation
to
get
a
new
fire
department
which
is
going
to
come
into
existence
10
years
from
now
and
put
the
next
fire
out.
the
emergency
--
an
emergency
to
us
is
something
immediate
and
here
we
have
a
drop
in
a
bucket
even
when
it
works,
all
port
authority
could
do
is
to
drop
in
a
bucket
of
the
transit
problem
on
the
eastern
seaboard.
now,
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
if
you
say
that
that
is
the
interest
of
the
state
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
think
you
can
ask
how
important
the
interest
of
the
state
is
and
the
interest
of
the
state
in
mass
transit
is
extraordinarily
important.
i
might
add
here
and
we’ve
developed
it
in
our
brief
to
some
extent.
they
are
lots
of
other
ways
to
do
it
and
the
worst
way
in
our
opinion
that
you
can
possibly
do
it
is
to
break
your
word
to
the
creditors
that
you
induced
to
invest
in
the
bonds
of
port
authority
and
because
you
have
an
interest
in
mass
transit
and
god
knows
there
are
lots
of
other
ways
you
can
get
that
money
and
there
are
lots
of
other
ways
you
can
cut
down
on
automobiles.
i
merely
mention
world
war
ii,
they
cut
down
on
automobiles.
they
cut
down
on
the
use
of
gasoline.
if
you
got
an
emergency
you
can
handle
it,
but
you
do
not
handle
it
by
going
out
and
breaking
your
solemn
word
to
investors,
who
have
invested
$1,200,000,000.00
while
that
covenant
was
in
effect
on
reliance
on
the
states
that
they
were
not
going
to
repeal
it.
so
much
for
emergency
and
the
basis
for
the
state’s
action.
in
1962,
--
from
1962
and
1974,
the
covenant
was
an
integral
part
of
the
bondholders’
contract.
it
was
contained
in
every
official
statement.
mr.
devereux
milburn
i
was
going
to
ask
the
time
to
rebut
but
the
let
me
discuss
el
paso
and
may
be
i
--
mr.
devereux
milburn
thank
you.
mr.
devereux
milburn
thank
you
sir.
just
to
finish
reliance.
well,
i
won’t
finish
reliance,
i’ll
come
back
to
reliance
and
let
us
go
to
el
paso.
gentleman,
everyone
here
is
familiar
with
the
facts
of
that
case
and
decision
in
it.
i
have
established
here,
i
hope
that
the
covenant
induced
investors
to
put
their
money
into
the
port
authority.
there
was
no
inducement
in
el
paso.
el
paso,
the
people
that
were
hurt
by
el
paso
were
defaulters.
the
plaintiff
there
or
the
petitioner
was
a
rank
speculator.
he
had
in
that
statute
an
unbargained
for
benefit.
if
he
had
any
bona
fide
interest
in
the
piece
of
land
in
which
he
owned
that
interest,
he
had
five
years
after
the
passage
of
a
new
statute
within
which
to
come
up
with
the
money
to
stop
being
a
defaulter
and
to
own
the
land.
mr.
devereux
milburn
he
bought
the
land.
he
did
buy
one,
when
he
bought
the
land
the
statute
was
in
effect.
now,
in
our
case,
we
bargained
for
the
statute.
we
said
you’ll
--
we’ll
give
you
the
money,
but
you
do
this,
in
person
at
that
time
in
1962.
the
investment
community
talked
to
the
state
that
if
you
do
this,
we'll
do
that
and
the
h
&
m
will
run.
this
fellow
didn’t
have
any
bargain
with
the
statute
with
the
legislation
to
past
statute
and
that’s
an
important
difference.
now,
as
mr.
justice
white
said,
five
years
is
a
pretty
fair
deal
for
anybody,
any
defaulter
who
really
wants
its
land.
it
gave
him
five
years
to
come
up
with
the
money
and
he
could
keep
it.
this
statute
was
directly
against
the
defaulters,
the
speculators
who
were
in
there
and
it
was
a
case
to
correct
the
land
problem
in
the
state
of
texas.
now,
again
in
my
opinion,
this
court
never
dreamed
that
the
el
paso
case,
dealing
as
it
did
with
defaulters
and
speculators,
would
be
brought
out
and
used
as
binding
precedent
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
creditors
of
a
state
dealt
with
the
state
bargained
for
a
deal
with
the
state
and
then
it
was
repudiated,
abrogated
not
modified
but
abrogated
completely.
now
in
el
paso,
it
was
modified.
it
was
not
abrogated.
so,
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
can
say
that
i
agree
with
el
paso.
i
think
el
paso
is
right,
but
i
agree
with
our
position
in
this
case
and
i
think
we’re
right.
i
think
you
have
two
completely
different
contracts
and
two
completely
different
situations.
now,
excuse
me,
is
that
light
is
going
to
go
on
again
in
five
minutes
or
--
?
mr.
devereux
milburn
well,
i’d
like
to
save
what
i
have
left.
it
will
be
about
seven
minutes
i
guess.
that’s
about
right.
mr.
devereux
milburn
thank
you.
mr.
devereux
milburn
yes,
sir.
i
was
wrong
and
i
apologize.
i’ve
forgotten
mr.
thompson’s
statement
about
the
obtaining
bondholder’s
consent.
i
don’t
know
who
in
the
state
was
in
touch
with
mr.
thompson
so,
they
didn’t
try
it.
but
it
seems
to
me
they
should
have
tried
it.
it’s
built
right
into
the
statute
so
that’s
the
way
to
change
it
and
that’s
way
to
modify
it,
and
i
don’t
think
there's
any
excuse
for
not
trying
it
because
you
think
it
isn’t
going
to
work
particularly
and
when
it
did
work
not
to
long
before
that
with
the
triber
bridge
authority.
now,
increasing
tolls
i
thought
i’ve
covered
this
in
my
opening
statement,
$40
million,
$12
million
it
doesn’t
go
to
mass
transit.
it
goes
to
the
bondholders,
it
goes
into
the
path
and
if
doesn’t
go
into
the
path,
there
is
a
breach
of
the
covenant
with
bondholders.
and
there's
another
lawsuit
and
dave
simmons
is
quite
right
i
will
be
back,
if
that
happens.
now,
actually
there's
$296,000.00
increase
between
1974
and
1975.
now,
you’re
not
talking
about
$40
million,
you’re
talking
about
$12
million.
you’re
not
talking
about
the
$12
million
you
need
for
path
plainfield.
is
a
state
guarantee
impossible?
new
york
did
it
with
the
commuter
cause.
new
jersey
didn’t
but
new
york
did
and
they’re
still
there,
some
of
them.
now
also,
i
might
point
out
that
the
two
governors
have
prevented
between
them
one
through
to
one
another
a
fair
rise.
they
don’t
even
do
that.
they
don’t
even
pass
the
five
cents.
the
amtrak
is
running
at
a
dollar,
right
next
to
it.
two
parallel
tracks.
would
the
governors
give
them
a
fair
rise
than
dollar?
no.
they
won’t.
why
can’t
the
states
do
something
except
abrogate
our
contract?
that’s
what
i
would
like
to
know.
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
kind
of
question.
now,
mr.
justice
marshall
you
mentioned
a
new
deficit
in
filling
into
the
path.
we’ve
got
ability,
we
all
admit
that,
we’ve
got
one
running
about
$28
million.
it
was
supposed
to
run
six
it
is
running
28.
let’s
put
another
one
in
there
and
let's
say
that
the
commissioners
are
wrong
again,
a
wrong
by
a
factor
of
five
again.
let
say
we
got
another
$30
million
deficit
in
there
and
in
the
meantime
path
has
gone
up.
we’re
talking
about
a
$70
million
deficit.
let’s
have
a
little
depression.
let’s
have
our
airports
slack
off
a
little
bit
and
they
are
going
to
default
on
the
bonds.
that’s
why
we
don’t
want
a
tremendous
new
deficit
into
the
port
authority
and
you
can’t
stop
it
because
it
comes
in
as
a
baby
and
it
grows
into
a
giant.
now,
the
plaintiff’s
press
conference,
we
savage
the
bonds.
in
my
humble
opinion,
one
of
the
major
reasons
of
those
bonds
haven’t
gone
down
further
is
because
we
are
standing
here.
i
don’t
know
a
bondman
in
wall
street
that
doesn’t
think
that
this
is
an
outrage
and
we’re
going
to
win.
now
if
we
don’t,
let’s
see
what
happens
to
the
bonds.
now,
i
just
--
i
if
i
could
consider
mr.
murphy
for
a
moment,
mr.
murphy
made
a
statement
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
that
if
you
bought
a
car
and
you
had
a
12-month
warranty
and
all
of
a
sudden
became
six-month
warranty,
you
wouldn’t
buy
a
car
from
that
fellow
again.
so,
that’s
what's
happened
to
the
bond
market.
now,
barr
brothers
puts
out
their
ads.
but
what
is
there
business?
pushing
bonds.
who
owns
the
port
authority
bonds?
they
do.
they
got
to
sell
them.
they
just
can’t
leave
them
on
the
shelf.
i
put
no
credence
on
that
and
that’s
an
ad,
that’s
passing.
but
mr.
murphy
was
testifying
under
oath
and
i
do
put
some
credence
in
that.
now,
to
sum
up
let
me
say
this,
i
don’t
think
this
is
this
case,
is
a
case
--
it
can
be
decided
either
way.
it
has
been
decided
the
way
that
i
thought
it
was
impossible,
but
it
has
been
decided
that
way.
it
would
be
possible
to
decide
it
the
other
way.
i
don’t
think
this
is
a
fact
case.
i
don’t
think
this
is
lower
case.
i
think
that
this
is
a
moral
case.
i
think
the
state
have
repudiated
their
words.
i
think
this
case
in
its
present
posture
represents
a
leak
in
the
dike
of
state
integrity
and
i
think
that
this
court
can
stop
that
leak
before
it
becomes
an
avalanche.
thank
you.
