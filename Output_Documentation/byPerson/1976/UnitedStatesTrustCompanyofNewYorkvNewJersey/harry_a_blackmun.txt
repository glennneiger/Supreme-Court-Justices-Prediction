justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
it
is
one
of
those
infrequent
cases
that
centers
in
the
contract
clause
in
article
i
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
clause
provides
that,
"no
state
shall
pass
any
law
impairing
the
obligation
of
contracts."
in
1921,
new
jersey
and
new
york
with
the
consent
of
the
congress
as
the
constitution
requires,
entered
into
a
bistate
compact,
and
through
that
compact
of
55
years
ago,
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
was
established
and
given
enumerated
powers.
it
was
conceived
as
a
financially
independent
agency.
it
developed
and
came
to
operate
some
of
the
famous
bridges
in
the
new
york
area
as
well
as
the
hammond
tunnel
and
in
due
course
its
outstanding
bonds
purchased
by
private
investors
came
to
be
secured
by
a
pledge
of
the
authorities'
general
reserve
fund.
lurking
in
the
background,
however,
was
the
serious
problem
of
mass
transit
in
the
area.
suggestions
were
made
and
oppose
that
the
port
authority
operate
the
financially
troubled
transit
systems
between
new
jersey
and
new
york
city.
and
out
of
this,
he
merged
a
statutory
covenant
by
the
two
states
in
1962.
the
covenant
was
part
of
bistate
legislation
authorizing
the
port
authority
to
acquire
and
construct,
and
operate
the
world
trade
center
and
the
hudson
and
manhattan
railroad.
and
by
the
covenant,
the
two
states
agreed
with
each
other
and
with
the
holders
of
bonds
issued
by
the
port
authority,
that
so
long
as
any
of
those
bonds
remained
outstanding,
neither
the
states
nor
the
authority
would
apply
any
of
the
tolls
that
has
been
pledges
security
for
the
bonds
for
any
railroad
purposes
whatsoever
other
than
permitted
purposes
here
and
after
set
forth.
with
those
permitted
purposes
are
detailed
and
there's
no
need
to
describe
them
here,
but
all
these
served
as
a
practical
matter
to
freeze
the
bridge
and
tunnel
revenues
to
specific
purposes
other
than
the
provision
of
mass
passenger
transportation
in
the
metropolitan
area.
ten
years
later,
in
1972,
the
two
states
by
legislation
repeal
the
covenant
prospectively
so
that
it
no
longer
applied
to
authority
bonds
thereafter
issued.
and
then
finally,
in
1974,
proposals
for
the
retroactive
repeal
of
the
62
covenant
were
passed
by
the
legislature
of
each
state
and
signed
by
its
governor.
it
is
that
retroactive
repeal
that
is
under
constitutional
attack
in
this
case.
the
attack
is
mounted
by
a
trust
company
as
holder
and
as
trustee,
a
port
authority
bonds.
two
of
the
well-known
cases
that
concern
the
contract
clause
are
home
building
and
loan
association
against
blaisdell
decided
in
1934
concerning
the
minnesota
moratorium
and
mortgage
moratorium
law
enacted
during
the
depths
of
the
great
depression,
and
el
paso
against
simmons
decided
in
1965
concerning
the
1941
texas
statute
which
limited
to
a
five-year
period,
the
theretofore
almost
unlimited
reinstatement
rights
of
an
interest
defaulting
purchaser
of
land
from
the
state
of
texas.
and
each
of
those
cases
upheld
the
challenge
legislation
in
the
face
of
a
contract
clause
attack.
in
the
present
case,
the
new
jersey
trial
court
dismissed
the
trustee's
complaint.
it
held
that
the
statutory
repeal
was
a
reasonable
exercise
of
new
jersey's
police
power
and
was
not
prohibited
by
the
contract
clause,
and
this
was
affirmed
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
a
per
curiam
opinion.
we
reversed.
we
hold
that
the
retroactive
repeal
of
the
1962
covenant
totally
eliminated
an
important
security
provision
and
impaired
the
obligation
of
the
contract
the
two
states
have
made.
this
security
provision
was
purely
a
financial
obligation.
it
was
not
a
mere
compromise
of
the
states
reserved
powers
that
cannot
be
contracted
away.
an
impairment
of
contract
such
that
it
is
involved
in
this
case
can
be
upheld
only
if
it
is
both
reasonable
and
necessary
to
serve
an
important
public
purpose.
here,
the
impairment
was
neither
necessary
to
achieve
the
state's
plan
to
encourage
private
automobile
users
to
shift
to
public
transportation
nor
reasonable
in
the
light
of
change
circumstances.
total
repeal
was
not
essential
since
the
states'
plan
could
have
been
implemented
with
less
drastic
modification
of
a
covenant.
further,
without
modifying
the
covenant
at
all,
the
states
could
have
adopted
alternative
means
of
achieving
their
twin
goals
of
discouraging
automobile
use
in
improving
mass
transit.
the

justice,

the
opinion,
has

separate
concurring
statement.

justice

opinion
and

in
that
by
