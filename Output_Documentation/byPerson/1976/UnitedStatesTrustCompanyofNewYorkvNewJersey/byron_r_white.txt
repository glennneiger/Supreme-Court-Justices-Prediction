even
with
respect
to
its
own
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
have
a
few
more
facts
and
just
describe
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
not
what
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
--
you
wouldn’t
say
there’s
any
per
se
rule
against
a
state
exercising
its
police
powers
with
respect
to
its
own
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
think
of
this
case
is
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
distinguishable
from
any
cases
that
approve
the
modifications
such
as
el
paso?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
you’ve
gone
by
along
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
talk
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
must
have
--
this
wasn’t
just
a
focus
thing.
i
don’t
see
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
like
to
--
i
know
you
would
like
to
say
they’re
--
it
was
that
and
they
would
like
say
there
was
an
emergency.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
perhaps,
at
the
minimum
you
could
say
their
object
was
to
achieve
what
the
repeal
of
the
covenant
would
achieve,
which
was
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
covenant
that
they
could
--mass
transit
would
mean
more
deficits
and
the
covenant
would
prevent
more
deficits?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
was
there
an
emergency
about
mass
transit?
i
guess
you
would
say
there
isn’t
anymore
than
always
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it’s
precisely
the
object
of
the
covenant?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
covenant
said
this
is
one
emergency
that
we
won’t
take
care
of
on
the
port
authority,
that’s
what
the
covenant
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
call
mass
transit
as
an
emergency,
you
can
say
that
the
covenant
said
this
is
one
emergency
that
port
authority
won’t
take
care
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
that
you
don’t
--
suppose
you
just
don’t
go
at
it
by
labels
and
you
just
say
that
the
real
inquiry
is
the
significance
of
the
interest
of
the
state
in
achieving
what
they’re
trying
to
achieve
by
the
repeal
of
the
covenant?
justice
byron
r.
white
say
that
instead
of
calling
it
an
emergency
or
instead
of
asking
where
there
is
an
emergency,
shouldn’t
you
ask
how
important
the
interest
of
that
state
that
seem
to
justify
the
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
sovern,
couldn’t
the
states
have
provided
that
if
the
authority
was
to
go
in
mass
transit,
you
could
go
into
it
as
a
separate
operation
in
the
sense
that
its
other
revenues
and
its
other
assets
would
not
be
subject
to
a
lien
of
any
losses
in
mass
transit
and
couldn’t
the
state
have
otherwise
underwritten
those
losses,
rather
than
expose
the
bondholders
who
have
the
right
to
a
revenues
and
other
operations?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
it
historically,
didn’t
--
in
the
beginning
didn’t
they
used
to
--
in
the
port
authority
in
the
early
days
specialized
in
bonds.
i
mean,
the
bonds
would
just
reach
certain
projects?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
bonds.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
nevertheless,
if
the
state
had
wanted
to
commit
there
own
credit
than
that
of
the
port
authorities,
they
could
have
had
the
port
authority
to
go
into
mass
transit
as
a
separate,
single
venture.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
the
states
themselves
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i'm
asking
you.
wasn't
this
some
--
this
is
certainly
was
a
feasible
and
less
intrusive
way
of
going
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn’t
feasible,
but
it
was
less
intrusive
as
far
as
the
bondholders
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
--
if
it’s
such
a
little
risk,
why
doesn’t
the
state
use
--
the
state
as
guarantee
the
outstanding
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
meaning
they
can’t
deal
without
having
a
referendum,
i
guess?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can’t
say
its
impossible?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it’s
a
very
tiny
risk
if
you
say,
so
i
do
not
know
why
the
state
wouldn’t
shoulder
that
risk?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
can’t
save
as
much
of
an
emergency,
when
you
try
it,
can
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
referendum
among
the
bondholders
on
whether
the
covenants
would
be
--
should
be
repeal,
wouldn’t
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
don’t
like.
they
--
but
you
couldn’t
convince
them
that
it’s
just
a
tiny
risk?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
saying
if
--
you
just
say
that
they
can
still
sell
some
bonds
but
the
people
buying
bonds
now
are
taking
their
risks?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
bondholders
--
no
bondholders
didn’t
think
they
were
taking
any
risk?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you’re
saying,
that
you
wouldn’t
expect
this
old
bondholders
would
ever
do
agree
to
the
repeal
of
the
covenant?
