mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
a
rather
narrow
one
here,
with
very
little
history
or
caseload
to
really
draw
upon.
the
court
had
the
issue
before
it
somewhat
in
the
bass
case,
united
states
v.
bass,
but
not
precisely,
the
question
raised
here
which
is
an
extension
of
bass.
in
bass,
however,
the
court
reviewed
the
legislative
history,
as
much
as
there
is
of
it,
and
concluded
the
legislative
history
is
of
no
great
force
and
effect
in
this
case.
i
think
we
have
to
start
again
at
that
touchdown,
accepting
bass
what
it
stands
for,
although
it
was
four
members
of
the
court
who
went
as
far
as
i
would
ask
the
court
to
go
on
this
case,
and
five
who
went
as
far
as
the
interpretation
that
you
have
to
have
an
interstate
commerce
nexus
for
possession
whether
it
be
current
or
not
was
not
reached
by
the
fifth
member.
in
the
legislative
history,
we
only
have
really
the
comments
of
the
senator
who
proposed
this
amendment,
senator
long.
in
fact,
three
other
senators
spoke
on
legislative
debate:
senator
domenici,
senator
dodd,
and
senator
mcclellan,
each
of
those
three
expressed
reservations
as
the
amendment
itself.
senator
domenici
said
“perhaps
it
has
gone
too
far,
we
can
try
and
work
it
out
in
conference."
senator
dodd,
who
drafted
title
iv
in
the
section
922
corresponding
statute,
said
he
was
uneasy
about
it
but
that
they
would
study
it
senator
mcclellan
said
it
requires
further
thought.
he
said
he
would
try
to
understand
it,
but
he
agreed
with
senator
domenici
that
it
may
go
too
far.
it
is
hard
to
say
what
they
were
talking
about.
looking
at
senator
long,
it
is
very
clear
what
he
had
in
mind.
he
wanted
to
stop
felons,
and
i
will
deal
only
with
the
felon
section
of
the
statute
since
that
is
what
this
case
covered.
he
wanted
to
stop
felons
from
having
guns
where
they
can
engage
in
further
crime
having
previously
demonstrated
that
propensity.
justice
blackmun,
in
a
dissent
in
bass,
goes
to
that
language
in
very
plain
language.
but
the
majority
in
the
bass
case
points
out
that
all
through
there
is
interstate
commerce.
in
922,
they
are
requiring
interstate
commerce
in
both
the
receiving
and
transporting
sections,
g
and
h.
in
1202,
they
site
clearly
interstate
commerce.
the
court
pursuing
that
held
in
bass
that
there
had
to
be
an
interstate
commerce
nexus.
it
is
interesting
though
in
senator
long’s
comments
in
the
legislative
history.
he
says
you
could
own
but
not
possess
a
weapon.
then
in
discussing
the
possession
of
a
weapon,
he
goes
on
further
and
says
very
clearly
“you
should
not
possess
it.
he
does
not
want
criminals
to
have
guns.
but,
he
uses
interchangeably
a
number
of
times
the
words
“acquire”
with
“possess”
and
“taking”
with
“possess.”
he
says
this
amendment
does
not
seek
to
do
anything
about
who
owns
a
firearm.
he
was
concerned
with
the
complaints
about
title
iv,
the
dodd
bill,
at
that
time.
in
bass,
the
court
quotes
the
statements
of
congressman
pollack
has
very,
very
small
debate
in
the
house
of
representatives
on
it.
congressman
pollack
says
one
who
takes,
possess,
or
receives
a
firearm
across
state
lines
and
then
has
a
number
of
other
statements
sited
in
a
brief
for
the
respondent.
what
we
are
left
with
is
a
statute
with
literally
no
legislative
history.
only
the
comments
of
senator
long
which
are
contradictory
in
places,
although
his
intent
is
clear,
but
it
is
only
his
intent.
he
never,
however,
expresses
clearly
the
intent
whether
it
must
in
fact
be
that
interstate
nexus
required
in
the
bass
case.
so
the
court,
then,
has
to
look
where
to
go
with
the
matter.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
the
place
we
have
to
go
to
the
barrett
decision
of
this
court
in
1976
which
is
very
interesting
in
its
scope.
in
barrett,
it
is
a
922
case
and
it
does
go
to
a
case
concerning
receiving
a
firearm
that
has
traveled
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
blackmun
in
the
majority
opinion
in
barrett
points
out
that
you
must
look
to
the
specific
language
of
the
statute.
now
barrett
is
a
case
on
922
whether
is
a
good
deal
of
legislative
history
where
there
were
reports
from
the
congress,
there
were
extensive
debates
from
the
congress.
there
was
much
that
could
be
looked
at.
but,
barrett
was
quoting
justice
blackmun
as
couched
in
the
present-perfect
tense.
it
sited
a
gun
that
has
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
or
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
it’s
the
exact
language.
justice
blackmun,
looking
at
it
there,
writing
for
the
majority,
said
“you
must
look
at
exactly
what
they
meant
by
the
tense
itself.”
now
there
was
discussion
between
the
majority
and
dissenting
views
in
bass
as
to
where
comments
were
placed.
i
suggest
the
court
that
given
the
legislative
history
of
the
lack
of
it
in
the
bass
case,
you
can
draw
no
inferences
for
any
comments
or
lack
of
them.
but
in
barrett,
very
precisely,
the
court
says,
we
must
look
at
the
tense
used,
we
must
look
at
what
legislature
ended
up
saying.
that
is
particularly
pertinent
in
1202
with
no
legislative
history
to
draw
upon.
you
must
look
at
what
they
said
and
deal
with
what
they
said
or
take
upon
yourselves
the
tour
of
legislating.
they
pointed
out
in
the
barrett
case,
section
922(k),
justice
blackmun
points
it
out.
he
uses
the
words
“in
commerce”
and
that
is
the
same
language
that’s
used
in
section
1202,
the
section
before
the
court
now.
justice
blackmun
points
out
there
is
no
lenity
required
in
examining
section
922,
because
there
are
no
ambiguities
as
there
were
in
section
1202
as
pointed
out
in
bass.
he
further
points
out
there
was,
of
course,
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history,
but
points
out
interestingly
enough
that
the
legislative
history
pointed
in
section
922
similar
to
that
small
amount
of
history
on
section
1202
that
they
want
to
prevent
possession
by
criminals
of
handguns.
the
scope
of
who
has
them
is
different
between
the
two
statutes.
the
people
under
indictment
are
included
in
922
and
1202
has
to
be
people
convicted
of
a
felony
aside
from
other
classes
of
people.
but
what
is
clear
between
the
two
is
congress,
in
both,
had
an
interstate
commerce
requirement.
it
is
in
both
statutes
and
it
is
a
question
of
how
the
court
will
apply
that.
the
sole
question,
as
i
see
in
this
case,
is
what
is
the
degree
of
nexus?
can
it
be
current
or
must
it
be
current?
can
it
be
past
or
must
it
be
any
nexus?
you
approached
this
in
the
rewis
case.
now,
rewis
was
not
a
gun
case,
it
was
an
interstate
gambling
case
under
the
travel
act.
but
there,
you
approached
the
problem
of
what
is
the
degree
of
nexus
required?
how
much
interstate
commerce
must
there
be
or
what
degree
of
interstate
commerce
must
it
be
for
it
to
be
a
violation
of
law?
when
you
look
at
the
two
acts,
the
1202
act
is
very
precisely
in
current
and
present
tense.
“one
who
receives,
possesses,
or
transports
in
commerce,
or
affecting
commerce.”
it’s
nothing
past
in
it
as
opposed
to
922,
as
i
read
a
moment
ago.
“receive
any
firearm
or
ammunition
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.”
the
922
does
not
have
a
proscription
against
possession,
but
the
language
on
interstate
commerce
between
the
two
is
very
instructive.
i
suggest
to
the
court,
the
only
place
you
can
look
for
an
interpretation
of
1202
is
the
language
itself
and,
as
you
pointed
out
in
barrett,
you
must
look
clearly
at
the
tense
used
and
take
that
for
what
congress
meant
in
the
absence
of
anything
else.
in
the
bass
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
title
vii
was
not
carefully
molded
to
complement
title
iv.
in
fact,
title
vii
may
be
one
of
the
worst
examples
of
legislation
in
terms
of
careful
consideration
on
the
congress’s
behalf.
it
was
brought
to
the
floor
and
read,
a
week
later,
it
was
brought
to
the
floor
and
read
again.
during
the
first
week
only
comments
were
made
by
senator
long.
during
the
second
week,
senator
long
made
comments
again.
he
had
a
couple
of
questions
from
the
three
other
senators
and
then,
it
was
supposed
to
go
to
conference
but,
for
some
reason,
not
clear
in
the
congressional
record,
it
was
immediately
voted
off
and
passed.
in
bass,
the
majority
opinion
by
four
justices
goes
farther
than
just
saying
there
must
be
a
nexus.
it
suggests
there
is
a
difference
between
possession
and
receipt
offenses.
this
goes
on
to
state
very
clearly
that
more
is
required
for
possession
offense
and
this
has
been
treated
by
the
government
in
their
brief
as
pure
dictum.
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
pure
dictum
in
the
opinion
of
the
united
states,
supreme
court.
in
the
second
circuit,
the
bell
decision,
as
in
the
united
states
versus
bell,
which
came
down
late
1975,
they
treated
that.
they
followed
the
particular
position
we
ask
the
court
to
follow
in
this
case.
they
took
the
totally
opposite
view
of
the
fourth
circuit.
but
there,
they
sited
the
difference
between
what
they
call
obiter
dictum
and
judicial
dictum.
they
pointed
out
that
the
language
in
bass
was
not
just
judges
speculating
about
something
but
a
specific
problem.
it
was
a
problem
that
was
present
in
bass
while
not
directly
considered
by
the
court
in
the
opinion,
not
expressly
considered.
the
court
had
to
inherently
consider
because
the
court
dismisses
bass,
dismisses
the
indictment
eventually
saying
there
is
no
interstate
nexus
demonstrate
in
the
record.
the
court
recognizes,
inherently
in
there,
they
would
have
to
be
an
interstate
nexus
shown
to
reach
a
conviction.
the
question
of
whether
it
needs
to
be
current
or
past
nexus
would
be
inherent
in
that.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
did
not
go
that
far,
your
honor,
saying,
he
had
to
be
in
interstate
commerce
but
they
went
as
far
as
this
court
went
in
bass
or
that
the
majority
went
in
bass
that
it
had
to
be
a
current
nexus
of
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
that
the
person
himself
is
in
commerce
where
the
person
himself
is
engaged.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
may
not
be,
your
honor
and
if
the
person
is
in
an
interstate
facility,
not
actually
going
interstate
but
somehow
affecting
commerce.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
if
he
is
there,
your
honor,
and
conducting
an
act,
say,
a
robbery
of
an
interstate
facility,
the
possession
there
would
pertain
with
transporting
or
it
might
not.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir,
if
the
gun
itself
is
in
interstate
commerce,
there
is
a
clear
showing
perhaps
the
gun
was
passing
through
his
possession,
it
was
a
temporary
possession
of
a
gun
that
had
not
come
to
rest
out
of
interstate
commerce,
then
that
also
would
pertain.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
the
receipt
could
well
be
prior
to
the
time
of
his
conviction,
as
we
have
in
this
case,
the
scarborough
case,
but
there
could
be
a
contract
to
sell
the
gun
or
a
pledge
or
some
kind
of
adequate
legal
showing
to
move
the
gun
again
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
would
cover,
i
think
there
will
probably
be
a
whole
slew
of
things,
our
position…
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
if
the
government’s
construction
is
true.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
ever
previously,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
am
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
the
problem
there
is
the
same
thing,
i
have
a
difference
here
between
receipt
and
possession.
any
receipt,
even
interstate,
shows
a
further
movement
of
the
weapon.
any
receipt
will
show
that.
any
coming
into
possession,
after
the
conviction
of
felony
would
show
a
further
movement
of
the
weapon,
there
has
to
be
an
inherent
receipt
there.
so,
interstate
commerce
will
all
be
to
transfer
to
interstate
will
not
have
come
to
rest.
but
once
that
gun
comes
to
rest
in
the
possession
of
somebody,
in
this
case
it
was
under
a
man’s
bed
for
some
period
of
time.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
strongly
feel
that.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
i
believe
among
things
it
could
mean,
your
honor,
is
that
if
the
person
receives
the
gun
in
the
instance
that
you
gave
after
being
convicted
of
a
felony
and
the
government
cannot
make
a
case
on
receipt
because
they
cannot
show
where
receipt
was
for
instance.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
they
could
charge
the
possession.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no,
that
has
traveled
and
come
into
his
possession
after
the
time
of
his
felony
conviction.
that
would
be
one
of
the
reasons
possession
would
be
to
cover
that
particular
loophole.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
would
be
receipt,
your
honor,
but
the
government
may
have
difficulty
in
making
a
case
based
on
venue
problems.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
preceded
by
--
yes
sir,
but
not
necessarily
the
same
thing
--
one
circuit,
at
least
the
sixth
circuit,
held
it
was
identical
with
which
we
take
exception
of.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
i
assume
no
one
was
born
with
a
gun,
the
only
way
i
could
see
it
happening.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
at
that
moment,
he
is
guilty
of
the
offense
of
possession
within
interstate
commerce
nexus,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
my
position
would
be,
your
honor,
as
long
as
he
receives
that
gun
after
he
is
convicted
of
a
felony
and
the
gun
has
previously
traveled
in
interstate
commerce,
he
would
be
violating
the
statute.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
as
long
as
it
is
after
the
conviction
of
the
felony,
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
think
that
would
end
up
being
a
factual
determination
that
i
cannot
approach
at
this
time.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
if
the
gun
came
to
him
through
any
contact
with
interstate,
he
would
be
guilty.
if
the
gun
came
to
him
through
a
commercial
means,
i
assume
interstate
would
not
have
ended
and
he
would
be
guilty
of
possession
offense.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
that
is
correct,
i
do
not
take
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
as
long
as
it
still
moves
in
commerce,
whether
intrastate
or
interstate,
having
previously
moved
in
interstate,
the
view
i
have
taken
is
that
the
intrastate
is
a
continuation
or
extension
of
the
interstate
movement
regardless
of
time,
i
guess.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
believe
it
would
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
it
is
pointed
out
in
the
footnote
that
the
respondents
recognized
that
difficulty.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
it
has.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
for
possession,
you
would
have
to
prove,
as
we
take
the
position
in
this
case,
that
he
received
it
subsequent
to
the
time
of
his
conviction
of
a
felony.
the
possession
offense
would
then
occur
the
moment
that
he
received
it
or
continuously
there
after.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
the
government
is
very
hard
pressed
to
make
that
kind
of
proof,
no
question,
your
honor.
there
may
be
people
with
him
at
the
time.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no,
it
is
true
of
many
criminal
statutes,
your
honor,
is
that
difficulty
of
proof.
but
on
the
other
token,
there
is
this
question
of
lenity
and
a
strict
construction
of
criminal
statutes.
i
do
not
think
the
court
can
make
any
great
inferences
given
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
statute.
i
think
the
court
was
eminently
correct
in
the
part
3
of
the
bass
case
and
that,
that
is
the
position
the
court
has
to
follow
and
it
is
exactly
what
the
court
did
in
the
barrett
case.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
barrett
treated
as
dicta,
but
even
dicta
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
barrett
was
a
’76
case,
yes.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
sir,
922.
it
does
site
bass
for
some
propositions.
the
only
thing,
i
bring
to
the
court’s
attention
is
the
fact
that
the
courts
of
appeals,
in
variously
considering
the
bass
case,
have
some
of
them
taken
independent
views
and
support
of
the
bass
case.
the
bell
case
in
the
second
circuit
is
such
a
case.
walker
in
the
seventh
circuit
gives
some
support
to
it
also
--
in
fact,
in
the
walker
case,
in
a
footnote
there,
the
court
points
out
that
a
federal
prosecution
of
the
state
offenses
historically
must
be
expressly
authorized.
that
is
one
of
the
underlying
major
problems
in
the
case.
it
is
an
offense
that
many,
many
states
specifically
deal
with.
to
disregard
an
interstate
commerce
nexus
would
intrude
much
on
the
province
on
the
states.
as
the
courts
point
out,
several
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
the
walker
court,
the
bell
court,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
bass
and
barrett,
before
such
an
intrusion
is
made
by
the
federal
judiciary
and
the
federal
legislature,
there
should
be
a
very
specific
intent
expressed
by
the
federal
legislature
to
make
such
an
intrusion.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
very
briefly,
your
honor.
your
honor,
on
the
question
of
petitioner’s
construction
with
regard
to
a
weapon
that
has
not
yet
come
to
rest,
i
suggest
the
court,
it
is
only
the
way
you
can
harmonize
the
bass
and
barrett
decisions
with
any
present
position.
it
was
raised
in
and
the
reason
i
took
the
by
the
position
taken
by
then,
judge
stevens,
in
the
walker
case,
we
express
surprise
on
the
scope
of
receipt.
if
you
limit
the
interstate
commerce
nexus
to
a
present
nexus
on
possession,
he
says
there,
receipt
may
be
too
broad.
what
is
inherent,
i
think,
in
justice
marshall’s
opinion
in
bass
is
that
if
a
gun
is
still
moving,
once
having
started
interstate
commerce,
interstate
commerce
will
flow
until
the
gun
comes
to
rest.
so,
receipt
goes
farther
than
possession
does,
it
is
the
only
way
i
think
you
could
differentiate
the
two,
and
i
believe
we
did
that.
i
have
to
point
out
in
this
case,
my
client
was
convicted
of
four
weapons,
one
of
which
had
an
1880
date
of
interstate
commerce.
there
must
be
a
break,
it
was
a
de
minimis
interstate
commerce
contact
after
some
90
years.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
they
would
if
we
knew
the
jury
convicted
for
the
more
recent.
no
one
knows
what
the
jury
did,
they
had
four
weapons
before,
but
that
is
the
problem
with
the
stock
that
justice
powell
raised.
the
fact
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
that
that
weapon
had
been
given
to
his
father
to
sell
prior
to
the
time
of
this
conviction,
and
he
had
gotten
that
part
just
for
his
father.
but,
you
get
a
de
minimis
connection
because
if
someone
buys
bullets,
does
that
make
the
weapon
an
interstate
commerce
or
a
scope
or
a
side
or
cleaning
oil
or
what
have
you.
i
can
only
suggest
in
closing
that
in
bass,
justice
marshall
quotes
justice
homes
in
a
case,
in
which
he
cites
the
footnote
15,
that
when
people
go
out
to
buy
guns,
there’s
difference
of
people
going
out
to
commit
murder,
they
look
for
guidance
very
often
in
statute.
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
that
this
petitioner
looked
for
guidance.
he
spoke
to
the
police
and
he
spoke
to
council
about
the
ability
to
keep
those
guns
at
his
house.
he
was
advised
he
could
do
so.
it
is
precisely
what
justice
homes
suggested
that
people
will
look
for
guidance.
the
guidance
was
there
in
the
bass
case.
it
is
not
petitioner’s
construction
which
government
takes
issue,
it
is
the
construction
of
four
justices
of
this
court.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
that
might
be
a
harsh
moral,
your
honor,
because
conviction
of
a
felony
carries
within
a
number
of
proscriptions,
of
rights
of
citizenship,
and
if
we
give
full
credence
to
your
innocence
and
proven
guilty,
you
have
a
right
to
maintain
your
rights
of
citizenship
until
such
time
as
the
court
says
you
are
guilty.
thank
you,
your
honor.
