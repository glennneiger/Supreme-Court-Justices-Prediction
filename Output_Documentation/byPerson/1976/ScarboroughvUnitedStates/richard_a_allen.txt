mr.
richard
a.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
confess
that
for
mr.
hershkoff’s
comments
i
am
a
little
confused
myself
as
to
exactly
what
his
position
is
with
respect
to
the
elements
necessary
for
the
possession
offense.
i
assume
that
his
position
remains
from
what
appears
on
his
brief.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
clear,
your
honor.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
1202(a)
of
the
appendix
of
title
18
prohibits
a
convicted
felon
from
possessing
a
firearm
that
has
previously
traveled
in
interstate
commerce,
as
we
contend,
or
whether
it
only
prohibits
a
convicted
felon
from
possessing
a
firearm
when
that
firearm
is
moving
in
or
is
a
part
of
interstate
commerce,
as
i
understand
the
petitioner
to
contend.
that
issue
is
extremely
important
to
federal
law
enforcement
and
the
enforcement
of
the
comprehensive
gun
control
legislation
that
congress
enacted
in
1968
for
the
following
reasons.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
would
--
that
is
the
issue
here,
your
honor,
it
would
be
extremely
important,
it
would
create,
in
our
view.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
as
i
understand
his
position,
your
honor,
the
petitioner’s
construction
in
this
case
would,
in
our
view,
create
a
substantial
gap
in
the
federal
gun
control
legislation
that
was
enacted
in
1968.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
those
among
others,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
believe
his
construction
would
tend
at
least
as
a
practical
effect
to
exclude
a
large
category
of
other
individuals
that
congress
intended
to
cover.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
petitioner’s
construction
at
least
as
i
understand
it
from
his
brief,
i
am
not
entirely
clear.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
as
this
court
recognized
in
united
states
versus
bass,
the
principal
purpose
of
the
entire
gun
control
statute
that
was
enacted
in
1968
was
to
keep
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
convicted
felons
and
other
persons
of
congress
classified
as
potentially
dangerous
or
irresponsible.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
at
least
according
to
his
testimony,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
a
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
he
also
possessed
them
after
he
was
convicted
of
a
felony,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right,
but,
as
this
court
recognized
in
barrett,
the
principal
purpose
was
to
keep
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
convicted
felons
that
is
out
of
the
hands
of
felons
who
had
been
previously
convicted,
as
petitioner
was
in
this
case.
petitioner’s
construction
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
a
rule
of
reason
would
permit
a
construction
of
the
statute
which
gave
him
reasonable
time
to
relinquish
possession
without
being
automatically
in
violation
of
the
statute.
i
think
that
would
be
a
--
mr.
richard
a.
allen
and
before
he
was
sentenced.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
statute
would
be
subject,
certainly,
prosecutorial
discretion,
i
am
sure
that
the
government
would
never
prosecute
a
person
who
was
attempting
to
exercise
possession
so
that
he
could
relinquish
his
possession.
but
any
offense...
mr.
richard
a.
allen
what
kind
of
approach
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
in
some
circumstances,
i
am
sure
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
think
of
that.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
we
would
not
want
to
conceive
that,
we
would
contend
that
if
he
were
in
violation
--
all
i
am
addressing
is
the
technical
point
of
whether
at
the
instant,
he
became
a
convicted
felon,
he
would
be
in
violation
of
the
possession
offense.
i
suppose
it
is
a
technical
matter
that
maybe
true.
i
am
not
sure
that
that
would
militate
in
favor
of
the
construction
the
petitioner
contends
for,
particularly
in
view
of
the
considerations
that
militate
against
it.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
petitioner’s
construction
in
this
case
would
exclude
very
large
categories
of
the
very
persons
that
congress
wanted
to
dispossess
or
keep
firearms
away
from
to
have
those
very
firearms.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
section
922,
which
is
part
of
title
iv
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968
which
says,
as
court
construed
in
barrett,
only
prohibits
a
convicted
felon
from
receiving
a
firearm
that
has
previously
traveled
in
interstate
commerce,
and
only
then
if
he
receives
it
after
his
felony
conviction
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
would
have
to
concede,
your
honor,
that
they
would
be
encompassed
with
our
construction
of
the
word
“possesses.”
mr.
richard
a.
allen
not
all,
as
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
am
advised
that
most
states
have
such
statutes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
believe
that
congress,
as
the
legislative
history
indicates,
was
extremely
concerned
of
the
impact
of
convicted
felons
and
other
dangerous
people
possessing
firearms
on
a
number
of
federal
interests
including
interstate
commerce.
i
think
that
is
revealed
in
every
page
of
the
legislative
history.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
frankly,
i
doubt
if
the
connection
to
the
interstate
commerce
concerns
the
most.
i
suspect
that
what
concerns
the
most
was
the
assassination
of
major
political
figures
including
federal
officials.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
a
judgment
for
congress,
your
honor,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
they
...
mr.
richard
a.
allen
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
wanted
to
give
the
federal
prosecutors
and
the
federal
courts
power
to
take
over
such
prosecutions
of
possessions
by
convicted
felons,
as
in
their
discretion,
as
they
thought
appropriate.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
are
an
awful
lot,
your
honor.
i
inquired
of
that
just
yesterday
and
i
was
unable
to
get
any
precise
statistics,
but
i
do
know
that
there
are
a
good
number.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
true.
as
i
was
saying,
the
petitioner’s
construction
of
the
statute
would
necessarily
permit...
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
contended
that
in
the
bass
case
that
that
was
precisely
congress’
intention
and
that
a
proof
of
interstate
commerce
nexus
in
each
individual
case
was
unnecessary.
because
of
those
very
interests,
that
construction
was
rejected
not
unreasonably
by
this
court
in
view
of
the
expressed
statutory
language
making
reference
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
this
court
in
bass
would
have
held
that.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
if
congress
makes
findings
that
the
possession
of
firearms
has
a
substantial
effect
in
interstate
commerce
then
i
believe,
under
decisions
of
this
court,
that
congress
could
constitutionally
within
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
punish
the
possession
of
a
gun.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
not
using
the
interstate
commerce
in
the
statute?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
there
is
not
--
the
petitioner
does
not
contend
that
our
construction
would
lead
to
an
unconstitutional
result.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
strictly
a
question
of
statutory
construction
and
an
important
one,
because
not
only
would
petitioner’s
construction
permit
felons
who
had
received
their
firearms
before
their
felony
convictions
or
before
the
effect
of
the
date
of
the
statute
to
retain
possession
of
those
firearms,
it
would
also,
in
a
number
of
cases,
permit
felons
as
a
practical
matter
to
possess
firearms,
to
receive
firearms
after
their
felony
convictions
and
escape
prosecution.
let
me
give
you
the
following
example
which
occurs
not
infrequently
in
prosecution
cases.
for
instance,
suppose
a
fellow
committed
a
felony
and
was
convicted
for
a
felony
in
1970.
in
1975,
he
was
found
in
possession
of
a
firearm.
suppose,
further,
that
the
government
was
able
to
prove
quite
conclusively
that
that
firearm
was
manufactured
in
say,
connecticut
and
let
us
say
that
he
was
found
in
possession
in
virginia.
that
it
was
manufactured
in
connecticut,
was
shipped
to
maryland
in
1973,
and
was
sold
to
some
other
individual
who
subsequently
lost
it
or
it
was
stolen
from
him.
although
those
facts
would
demonstrate
conclusively
that
the
individual
had
received
the
firearm
after
his
felony
conviction
and
after
the
statute
and
therefore
was
clearly
in
violation
of
section
922
of
title
iv,
the
government
may
often
not
be
able
to
prove
where
he
received
that
weapon.
since
venue
is
a
fact
to
be
proved,
the
individual
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
that
case.
in
other
words,
petitioner’s
construction
would,
as
a
practical
matter,
permit
felons
to
retain
possession
of
firearms
whenever
they
manage
to
acquire
the
firearms
in
a
way
that
the
place
or
time
of
acquiring
them
escaped
detection.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
they
could,
your
honor.
if
the
state
authorities
had
a
statute
that
prohibited
that
conduct
and
if
the
state
authorities,
for
some
reason
or
other,
wanted
to
prosecute
him,
they
could
do
so.
but,
i
think
that
congress
in
this
case
perceived
that
this
statute
was
extremely
important.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
normally,
it
is,
your
honor
and
i
suppose
the
states
have
at
least
as
great
an
interest
in
this
kind
of
problem
as
the
federal
government
does.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
true
and
in
many
federal
statutes,
drug
control
statutes.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
right,
that
is
one
of
the
interests
that,
certainly
underlies
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
but,
i
believe
that
congress
did
not
want
to
have
to
demonstrate
in
each
case
that
a
dangerous
person
who
was
in
possession
of
a
firearm
was
actually
moving
across
the
state
line,
that,
it
seems
to
me,
as
a
wholly
unnecessary
matter
of
proof
and
certainly
one
that
is
not
required
by
the
constitution.
our
construction
of
the
scope
of
section
1202
is
based
primarily
on
three
considerations.
first
of
all,
the
language
of
the
statute.
second
of
all,
the
relationship
of
section
1202
with
the
entire
scheme
of
federal
gun
control
legislation.
third,
the
legislative
history
of
section
1202
which,
not
withstanding
mr.
hershkoff’s
contention,
we
submit
unmistakably
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
the
broadest
possible
scope
to
this
section.
section
1202,
by
its
terms,
prohibits
any
convicted
felon
and
other
class
of
certain
categories
of
dangerous
individuals
from
“punishes
anyone
who
receives,
possesses,
or
transports
in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce
any
firearm.”
the
phrase
“in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce”
is
admittedly
not
as
clear
as
the
statutory
language
in
section
922,
which
this
court
construed
in
united
states
versus
barrett,
which
makes
it
unlawful
for
convicted
felons
or
certain
other
persons
”to
receive
any
firearm
or
ammunition
which
has
been
shipped
or
transported
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.”
nevertheless,
to
the
extent
that
the
statutory
language
in
section
1202(a)
is
a
guide,
we
submit
that
it
points
clearly
to
our
construction.
first,
the
phrase
“affecting
commerce,”
which
mr.
hershkoff
had
largely
ignored
but
which
is
also
in
section
1202,
is
essentially
a
statutory
term
of
art.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
court
has
recognized
the
distinction
between
legislation
limited
to
activities
in
commerce
and
an
assertion
of
congress’s
full
commerce
power
so
as
to
cover
all
activity
substantially
affecting
interstate
commerce.
congress
has
used
the
phrase
“affect
commerce
or
affecting
commerce”
in
a
number
of
statutes
which
have
been
interpreted
to
reach
transactions
involving
products
after
they
have
come
to
rest
with
interstate.
the
civil
rights
act
is
one
example
that
is
particularly
instructive
to
this
case.
in
42
usc
section
2000(a)(c),
the
civil
rights
act
defines
“operations
affecting
commerce.”
to
include
establishments,
a
substantial
portion
of
whose
product
“has
moved
in
commerce.”
a
particular
significance
of
that
statute
for
this
case
lies
in
the
fact
that
senator
long,
the
sponsor
of
section
1202,
made
specific
reference
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
1202
to
the
civil
rights
act
and
this
court’s
decisions
upholding
the
power
of
congress,
in
senator
long’s
words,
“to
regulate
matters
affecting
commerce,
not
just
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
itself.”
furthermore,
if
congress
had
wanted
to
limit
the
offenses
set
forth
in
section
1202
to
conduct
contemporaneous
with
the
movement
in
interstate
commerce,
it
clearly
could
have
and
would
have
used
language
employed
elsewhere
in
both
the
gun
control
statute
and
other
federal
statutes
which
indicate
such
a
limitation.
for
example,
section
922(j)
of
title
iv
of
the
gun
control
act
makes
it
unlawful
knowingly
to
receive,
conceal,
or
sell
a
stolen
firearm
“which
is
moving
as,
which
is
a
part
of,
or
which
constitutes
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.”
the
language
in
section
1202,
we
submit
is
quite
more
broad.
it
relates
not
only
to
firearms
that
are
in
commerce,
but
those
that
are
affecting
commerce
as
well.
in
fact,
the
construe
of
section
1202(a),
as
petitioner
would
construe
it,
would
be
to
read
the
term
“affecting
commerce”
out
of
the
statute
all
together.
apart
from
the
statutory
language,
the
relationship
of
section
1202
to
the
entire
scheme
of
federal
gun
control
legislation
indicates
that
the
possession
offense
includes
possession
of
firearms
that
have
previously
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
and
is
not
limited
to
possession
of
firearms
contemporaneous
with
interstate
commerce
movement.
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
this
court
in
barrett
recognized
that
the
entire
structure
of
the
gun
control
act
demonstrates
that
congress
sought
broadly
to
keep
firearms
away
from
the
persons.
congress
classified
as
potentially
dangerous
and
irresponsible.
section
922(h)
of
title
iv
prohibits
convicted
felon
of
receiving
a
firearm
after
his
felony
conviction
or
and
an
after
the
date
of
the
statute.
as
this
court
indicated
in
united
states
v.
bass,
the
receipt
offense
in
section
1202
has
the
same
scope.
the
only
effect
of
adapting
petitioner’s
construction
to
this
statute
would
be
the
convicted
felons
would
continue
to
be
prohibited
under
section
922
from
acquiring
new
firearms
after
their
felony
conviction
but
would
permit
convicted
felons
to
keep
old
firearms
that
they
had
acquired
before
their
felony
conviction.
furthermore,
as
i
have
mentioned,
even
convicted
felons
who
received
firearms
after
their
felony
convictions
could
not
be
prosecuted
under
petitioner’s
construction,
if
there
was
no
way
of
proving
when
or
where
they
had
acquired
those
firearms.
not
only
would
that
create
an
enormous
loophole
in
the
scheme
of
the
federal
gun
control
statute,
but
there
is
no
conceivable
reason
why
congress
would
have
intended
such
a
result.
the
act
of
receiving
a
firearm
has
no
inherently
greater
connection
to
interstate
commerce
than
the
act
of
possessing
a
firearm.
a
convicted
felon
may
receive
a
firearm
long
after
that
firearm
has
come
to
rest
in
the
state
where
he
receives
it
and
he
would
still
be
guilty
under
petitioner’s
construction
of
violating
both
section
922
and
section
1202(a).
the
act
of
receiving
the
weapon
has
no
closer
nexus
to
interstate
commerce
than
the
act
of
possessing
the
weapon
which
necessarily
follows
immediately
after
the
receipt.
furthermore,
receipt
is
a
term
that
encompasses
conduct
that
goes
far
beyond
any
commercial
transaction.
you
can
receive
a
weapon
by
gift
or
by
stealing,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
commerce.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
or
just
by
temporary
possession,
that
is
true.
in
short,
there
is
no
basis
for
concluding
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
proof
required
to
show
a
nexus
between
the
firearm
and
interstate
commerce
for
purposes
of
the
receipt
offense
and
the
proof
that
was
necessary
for
the
possession
offense.
certainly,
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
language
of
the
statute
for
such
a
distinction,
since
the
phrase
“in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce”
modifies
both
the
offense
of
receiving
and
possession
in
the
statute.
perhaps
the
most
important
consideration
in
terms
of
the
statutory
scheme
is
that
petitioner’s
construction
would,
in
effect,
read
the
term
possession
completely
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
either
interpretation
requires
some
redundancy.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
the
function
of
the
court,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
strive
to
give
effect
as
fully
as
possible
to
all
of
the
terms
of
the
statute
in
light
of
the
statute’s
primary
purpose.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
well,
as
a
matter
of
that
arithmetic,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
but,
in
terms
of
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
which
is
to
keep
firearms
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people,
it
is
completely
inappropriate,
it
seems
to
me,
to
construe
the
more
inclusive
term
“possession”
largely
to
nullify
it
in
order
to
preserve
some
independent
force
to
the
less
inclusive
term
“receives.”
it
seems
to
me
that
that
approach
is
completely
inappropriate
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
yes?
mr.
richard
a.
allen
your
honor,
there
is
a
possible
significance
to
that
fact.
it
is
our
primary
contention
that
the
term
“in
commerce
or
affecting
commerce”
encompasses
a
possession
of
any
firearm
that
has
had
some
previous
movement
in
interstate
commerce.
were
that
contention
rejected
and
were
the
interpretation
adapted
that
there
must
be
some
contemporaneous
nexus
with
interstate
commerce.
it
would
not
be
entirely
unreasonable,
i
suppose,
to
conclude
that
his
purchase,
in
the
course
of
his
possession
of
replacement
parts
for
his
gun
in
interstate
commerce
would
be
a
contemporaneous
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
that,
of
course,
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
our
primary
position
which
is
broader.
mr.
richard
a.
allen
it
might,
your
honor,
it
might
well.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
--
but
i
would
emphasize,
that
in
our
view
there
is
just
simply
no
rational
basis
for
concluding
that
the
offense
of
possession
in
this
statute
does
not
include
possession
of
firearms
that
had
previously
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
more
than
anything
perhaps
demonstrates
that
congress
was
intending
to
prohibit
the
possession
of
firearms
by
felons
as
broadly
as
possible.
this
court
in
bass
concluded
not
unreasonably
that
that
history
was
not
so
clear
as
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
any
showing
in
each
case
of
any
nexus
whatsoever
between
a
firearm
and
interstate
commerce,
particularly
in
view
of
this
fact
that
the
statute
had
language
that
specifically
made
reference
to
interstate
commerce.
but
beyond
that,
since
these
firearms
here
have
been
proven
to
have
had
a
nexus
with
interstate
commerce,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
legislative
history
is
quite
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
prohibit
possession
as
broadly
as
possible.
indeed,
every
word
of
the
legislative
history
or
every
sentence
reflects
a
concern
with
possession,
not
simply
as
mr.
hershkoff
had
suggested
ownership
or
acquisition.
possession
was
obviously
what
congress
was
after.
in
summary,
your
honor,
petitioner’s
construction
is
completely
at
odds
with
the
language
of
section
1202.
the
purpose
of
section
1202
is
reflected
in
the
entire
statutory
scheme,
and
the
legislative
history
of
section
1202.
its
construction
would
create
an
enormous
loophole
in
the
statute
and
a
loophole
which
would
frustrate
congress’
primary
purpose
in
enacting
this
entire
gun
control
legislation.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors
and
no
further
questions.
