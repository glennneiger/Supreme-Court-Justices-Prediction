i
think.

mr.

chief

e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
allen.
mr.
hirschkop,
do
you
want
to
have
it
any
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
more
recent
ones
have
solved
that
problem
at
least
on
that
issue
for
this
case,
do
they
not?
the
more
recent
weapons.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
hirschkop,
perhaps
the
moral
to
be
drawn
from
this
dilemma
that
is
posed
is
that
when
a
man
is
indicted
for
a
felony,
he
perhaps
better
divest
himself
of
firearms
that
come
under
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
opinion

the
court
in
75-1344,
scarborough

the
united

company
