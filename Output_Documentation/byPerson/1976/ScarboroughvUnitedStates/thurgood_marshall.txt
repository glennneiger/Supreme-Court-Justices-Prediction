what
if

goes
out
to

picks
up
from

six
guns
rapped
up
in
baggage?
justice
thurgood

well,
suppose
it
was
delivered
to
him
outside
of
the
gate
of
the
airport?
justice

the
possession?
justice
thurgood

as
long
as

justice
thurgood

but
the
man
is
convicted
of
a
felony
in
march
2nd
and
he
gets
a
gun
which
traveled
in
interstate
commerce
13
years
ago.
is
he
guilty?
justice
thurgood

these
facts
in
my
hypothetical
are
agreed
upon
and
in
affidavit
form.

in

revolver
purchased

has
been
in

justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
not
proving
along
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
in
the
world
could
you
prove
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
stand
out
in
the
corner
and
sell
the
man,
a
gun.

in

case,
that

justice
thurgood

that
was
a
later
case,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood

you
have
get
rule
of
reason
in
criminal
cases,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
if
you
took
a
literal
construction
of
the
statute.
he
would
become
--
it
seems
to
me,
a
convicted
felon
at
the
moment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
not
think
the
interstate
commerce
which
is
incidental,
because
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
guns,
why
not
just
say
guns?
the
only
reason
that
interstate
commerce
commission
was
put
in
there
was
to
get
federal
jurisdiction,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
had
not
made
it,
we
would
not
have
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
the
federal
government
make
a
crime
of
the
possession
of
a
gun?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
not
using
interstate
commerce
in
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
of
course,
i
suppose
the
federal
government
could
tell
the
state
authorities
about
the
man
they
had
found.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
the
government
has
a
greater
interest
in
the
problem
of
possession
of
guns
within
the
cities
and
the
like
than
state
government
does?
i
mean,
just
in
terms
of
general
allocation
of
how
we
normally
answer
problems,
i
can
see
that
thereâ€™s
normally
the
kind
of
questions
that
states
address
before
the
federal
government
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
equally
true,
the
loan
sharking
case
that
we
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
a
criminal
is
running
across
state
lines,
then
that
is
where
it
all
goes
back
to.
the
federal
government
had
to
find
some
way
to
pick
him
up,
otherwise,
they
would
run
from
state
to
state
and
back
in
the
20s
and
30s,
would
they
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
believe,
it
is
in
some
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
by
just
temporary
possession.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
interpretations
would
read
the
terms
of
receipt
and
transportation
completely
out
of
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
petitioner
says
two
and
yours
says
only
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
scarborough
case
is
a
case
here
on
writ
of
certiorari,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
prosecution
of
a
convicted
felon
for
possessing
firearms
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
regarding
the
statutory
of
required
nexus
between
the
interstate
commerce
and
the
possession
of
the
weapon.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
government
met
its
burden
by
proving
a
connection
if
it
demonstrated
that
the
firearm
possessed
by
the
felon
had
previously
travelled
in
the
interstate
commerce.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
affirmed,
both
the
tax
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
evidenced
a
congressional
intent
to
outlaw
possession
broadly
and
to
require
no
more
than
the
minimal
nexus
that
the
possessed
firearms
have
travelled
at
some
time
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
