unknown
speaker
in
bell,
the
court
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
expressed
the
view
that
the
possession
had
to
be
by
a
person
who
contemporaneously
was
himself
traveling
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
understand
that
to
be,
what
do
are
you
contending
in
this
case
that
possession
in
commerce
means
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
1202(a)?
unknown
speaker
if
the
person
himself
is
in
commerce
and
possesses
a
firearm,
then
the
word
“transport”
is
redundant,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
if
he
were
in
an
airport
or
at
a
railroad
station?
unknown
speaker
what
else
do
you
contend,
is
that
all?
did
you
think
this
person
can
be
convicted
of
possession
under
this
statute
only
under
those
circumstances
as
you
just
described
where
the
possessor
is
then
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
what
sort
if
a
case
would
that
be?
that
would
be
a
receipt
case,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
possession
for
the
purpose
of
sending
it
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
they
are
constructive
ways?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
your
position
in
this
case,
is
that,
read
as
extremely
as
the
government
suggests
the
language
should
be
read
that
the
moment
he
was
convicted
of
another
felony,
the
moment
any
person
is
convicted
of
a
felony,
if
he
has
at
home
a
firearm,
he
is
automatically
then
and
there
guilty
of
the
offense
of
possession,
post-conviction.
unknown
speaker
yes,
if
the
firearm
was
ever
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
that
is
basically
what
the
government
says,
although
the
government
says,
as
a
matter
of
grace,
we
would
give
a
little
leeway
for
him
to
get
rid
of
the
gun.
but
how
about,
if
after
his
conviction,
he
possesses
a
gun
that
he
did
not
possess
before
or
at
the
time
of
his
conviction,
if
after
his
conviction,
he
comes
into
possession
of
a
gun
that
has
moved
in
interstate
commerce,
you
would
not
conceive
that
the
statute
covers
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
the
purpose
of
my
question
is
to
find
out
what
you
think
the
statute
does
mean.
you
have
told
us
what
you
think
it
does
not
mean.
it
does
not
apply
to
this
case
in
your
submission.
unknown
speaker
but
what
does
it
mean?
it
certainly
covers
a
person
in
possession
who
is
himself,
then,
traveling
in
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
also
covered
by
the
word
“transports.”
if
possession
has
some
kind
of
independent
meaning,
what
does
it
mean
in
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
where
and
when.
unknown
speaker
of
a
gun
that
has
ever
traveled
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
statute
would
cover
that?
unknown
speaker
possession
acquired
after
the
conviction.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
understand,
why
would
that
not
be
receipt?
unknown
speaker
because
they
could
not
prove
where
and
when
it
was
received?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
every
possession
is
presumably
preceded
by
receipt.
unknown
speaker
receipt,
inevitably,
precedes
possession,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
in
answer
to
my
brother
marshall’s
question,
you
do
not
contend
that
the
statute
means
that
the
interstate
commerce
has
to
occur
after
the
conviction
in
order
to
support
a
conviction
for
possession.
unknown
speaker
because
the
possession
has
to
occur
for
the
first
time
after
the
conviction.
unknown
speaker
in
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
the
gun
that
has
ever
moved
in
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
pause
again,
i
want
to
be
sure,
i
get
this
right.
your
point
is
that
first
possession
after
the
conviction
for
the
felony,
if
you
could
prove
that,
that
proves
the
possession
offense
if
you
get
the
previously
having
been
in
another
state?
unknown
speaker
but
then
why
is
that
any
easier
to
prove
than
the
receipt
offense?
because
if
then
you
prove
when
it
was
first
received,
could
you
not
presumably
prove
where
it
was
first
received?
unknown
speaker
i
see,
it
is
just
that
the
difference
between
proving
both
when
and
where,
and
proving
when.
unknown
speaker
under
a
different
statute?
unknown
speaker
certainly
it
is
clear
that
his
position
is
that
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
this
is
important
if
the
statute
did
not
cover
cases
like
this?
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
what
you
stated
is
a
much
broader
exclusion
than
your
colleague
here
seems
to.
unknown
speaker
namely
those
who
have
possession
prior
to
his
conviction
for
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
well
he
would
not
exclude
any
others,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
one
he
stated
here
earlier?
unknown
speaker
okay,
well,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
these
firearms
were
in
the
hands
of
the
petitioner
when
he
was
not
a
convicted
felon.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
proof
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
accept
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
he
possessed
these
firearms
before
he
had
been
convicted
of
anything.
unknown
speaker
that
is
continuous
possession.
unknown
speaker
maybe
we
are
engaging
in
or
could
engage
if
we
continue
the
colloquy
and
double
talk,
but
your
view
is
that
once
there
is
a
conviction
then
automatically,
he
is
guilty
of
this
federal
offense,
if
he
has,
in
his
house,
a
firearm.
unknown
speaker
now,
when
you
are
talking
about
statutory
language,
it
either
covers
or
does
not.
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
after
a
verdict
comes
in,
there
is
some
laps
of
time
before
an
accused
is
sentenced
and
he
certainly
has
at
least
that
grace
period
to
dispose
off
the
weapons,
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
and
report
was
final.
unknown
speaker
we
do
not
ordinarily
apply
that
kind
of
an
approach
to
the
construction
of
criminal
statutes,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
the
approach
that
the
governments
will
not
enforce
literally
the
terms
of
the
statute,
given
the
governments
position
on
what
the
statute
literally
means.
in
some
situations,
there
had
not
been
holdings
that,
until
a
criminal
conviction
is
final,
their
impact
does
not
fall
for
certain
statutory
purposes.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
not
want
to
conceive
this
until
the
man
spends
two
or
three
years
litigating
his
appeals
that
he
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
statute
if
he
had
some
firearms.
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen,
just
so
i
have
it
clear,
under
your
construction
of
the
statute,
the
words
“receipt”
and
“transport”
are
totally
redundant,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
my
second
question
is,
why
do
you
suppose
that
congress
wanted
federal
courts
to
try
all
these
cases
instead
of
state
courts,
because
these
are
all
offenses
that
are
matters
of
state
law,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
is
the
possession
by
a
felon
of
a
firearm
as
most
state
says?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
purpose
of
this
statue
is
to
take
care
of
those
few
states
that
do
not
have
such
or
that
they
were
not
doing
their
job?
why
should
federal
courts
do
all
this
work?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
do
you
think
the
connection
of
interstate
commerce
is
what
concerns
the
most?
unknown
speaker
should
there
be
some
requirement
of
a
substantial
connection
of
the
interstate
commerce
if
that
is
the
point
then?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
decide,
is
what
judgment
they
really
made
that
the
federal
court
should
take
over
all
these
possession
trials
or
did
they
just
wanted
the
federal
courts
to
takeover
possession
trials
where
there
was
some
substantial
interstate
connection.
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
of
federal
law
enforcement
in
terms
of
number
of
cases
is
devoted
to
this?
do
you
have
any
idea,
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
them
with
that
impression.
unknown
speaker
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
these
cases.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that
in
the
extortion
at
long
case.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right,
in
perez
and
it
held
in
wickert
v.
philburn,
and
i
believe
there
was
an
unbroken
line
of
cases
to
that
effect.
power
of
commerce
under
the
commerce
book
clause
is
extremely
broad.
unknown
speaker
there
is
no
power
challenge
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
strictly
of
statutory...
unknown
speaker
mr.
allen.
unknown
speaker
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
this
petitioner
did
order
some
parts
for
one
of
the
weapons
subsequent
to
his
conviction.
do
you
attach
any
significance
to
that?
unknown
speaker
that
might
even
satisfy
the
test
of
the
bell
case
you
suggested.
