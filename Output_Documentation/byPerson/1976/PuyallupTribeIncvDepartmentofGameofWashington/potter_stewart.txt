justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
the
citation
to
mattz
v.
arnett
necessarily
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
reservation
continues.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
that
is
the
page
citation.
justice
potter
stewart
the
problem,
mr.
farr,
a
problem
is,
or
may
be,
if
we
decide
a
question
which
is
a
single
limited
question
that
is
put
forward
in
the
petitioner’s
petition
for
certiorari;
i.e.,
does
the
state
have
power
to
regulate
on-the-reservation
fishing
by
indians
who
are
members
of
the
tribe
or
reservation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
would
be
nothing
more
than
--
however
we
decide
it,
it
would
be
nothing
more
than
an
advisory
opinion
if
there
is
no
reservation.
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
want
your
opinion.
if
there
is
no
reservation,
then
however
we
decide
that
question
is
an
advisory
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
a
separate
different
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
would
look
like
a
map
of
the
city
of
tacoma,
or
part
of
it,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
has
washington
acquired
jurisdiction
under
public
law
280?
justice
potter
stewart
so
your
footnote
9
on
page
27
is
inaccurate.
justice
potter
stewart
inaccurate
in
that
sense.
justice
potter
stewart
just
factually,
these
hatchery
fish
are
born
in
hatcheries.
when
are
they
put
into
the
stream,
into
the
river?
justice
potter
stewart
as
parr
or
smolt?
justice
potter
stewart
as
smolt.
and
then
they
spend
how
long
in
the
freshwater
before
they
go
out
to
sea?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
ready
to
move
downstream,
then.
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
are
smolt
when
they
are
put
in,
and
they
are
ready
to
take
off.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
are
out
in
the
pacific
for
how
long?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
they
are?
justice
potter
stewart
none
come
in
as
the
equivalent
of
grilse
or
yearlings?
justice
potter
stewart
they
do
not
come
back
as
yearlings,
though.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
were
they
planted,
upstream
on
the
puyallup?
justice
potter
stewart
upstream
from
the
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
they
are
smolt.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
there
fishing
for
them,
then,
though?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
on
their
way
upstream.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
just
about
a
seven-mile
stretch,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
remand
in
puyallup
ii.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
this
matter
of
hatchery
fish
before
the
court
at
all
in
view
of
the
question
presented
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
they
have
asked
this
court
to
hold
that
the
state
has
no
power.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
none
of
them
are,
because
maybe
there
is
not
a
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
so
that
is
what
you
are
really
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
to
their
descendants.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
perhaps
a
misapprehension
of
the
court
in
puyallup
i,
which
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
said
we
do
not
need
to
be
concerned
with
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
the
reservation,
because
this
case
involves
fishing
by
indians
off
the
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
did
the
court
say
something
along
those
lines
in
the
course
of
its
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
purpose,
since
i
have
already
interrupted
you,
of
the
first
large
section
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
in
this
case,
giving
its
view
of
how
the
treaty
ought
to
be
construed,
a
view
in
conflict
with
other
constructions
of
the
other
one?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
in
any
case,
under
its
construction
of
the
treaty,
no
net
fishing
would
be
permitted
at
all
by
indians.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
was
the
function
and
purpose
of
that
law,
an
interesting
part
of
the
supreme
court
washington’s
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
in
puyallup
i.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
did
construe
it
to
allow
net
fishing,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
puyallup
i
construe
the
treaty
to
allow
indians
to
fish
by
net?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
explained
now
your
understanding
of
why
the
supreme
court
of
washington
wrote
that
part
of
its
opinion.
are
you
trying
to
persuade
us
along
the
same
lines?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
de
minimis
almost
to
it.
you
do
not
have
many
indians,
and
a
sports
fisherman
gets
a
steelhead
every
two
or
three
days
at
hard
fishing,
on
the
average.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
on
here;
that
is
with
a
good
line.
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
riverfront
trust
property
do
you
suppose
there
is?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
the
river
actually
does
not
run
through
any
property?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
assume
the
reservation
is
not
in
existence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
are
you
reading
from
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
says
off-reservation.
