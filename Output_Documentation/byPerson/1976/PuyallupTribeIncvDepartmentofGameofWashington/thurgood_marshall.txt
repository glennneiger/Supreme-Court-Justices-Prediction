justice
thurgood
marshall
and
both
times
to
go
around?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
if
we
took
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
stipulation
show
how
many
people
own
the
fishery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
about
8
or
9,
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
a
counting
of
two,
how
many
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
will
show
me
where
the
reservation
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
we
need
to
know
where
the
reservation
is
in
order
to
find
out
where
the
river
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where?
what
part
of
the
river
is
through
the
reservation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aren’t
we
being
asked
to
pass
on
a
certain
part
of
the
river?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
we
do
not
know
where
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
going
to
argue
that
that
is
res
judicata,
too,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
going
to
argue
that
tha
tis
res
judicata,
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
seem
to
have
missed
it,
but
why
are
they
automatically
not
included
in
the
treaty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
you
stated
it
as
a
fact.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
the
point
is,
you
did
not
have
those
fish
when
the
treaty
was
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
answer
is,
suppose
you
get
a
brand-new
type
of
fish
coming
by.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
somebody
makes
a
fish
and
puts
him
in
the
river.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
treaty
is
limited
to
the
fish
that
ran
the
river
when
the
time
the
treaty
was
made.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
what
i
said:
once
you
exclude
one,
you
are
meant
to
include
the
others.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
this
thing
between
two
state
highways?
this
thing
is
river?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn’t
this
the
reservation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
much
is
that
is
within
the
limits
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
that
sounds
correct,
is
there
any
evidence
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understood
you
rightfully
to
say
you
can
use
whatever
you
have
to
support
the
judgment.
but
you
have
to
have
some
evidence,
don't
you?
