mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
rodgers,
i
represent
the
petitioner,
puyallup
tribe,
in
this
case.
this
litigation
returns
here
for
the
third
time
in
its
fourteen-year
history.
the
case
involves
a
fishery
for
steelhead
trout
in
the
puyallup
river,
puyallup
reservation,
state
of
washington.
it
has
been
in
the
courts
now
for
a
period
covering
some
four
generations
of
steelhead.
we
believe
that
is
long
enough,
and
we
submit
there
is
but
one
issue
left:
whether
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate
an
on-reservation
fishery.
now,
this
case
does
not
involve
salmon;
this
case
does
not
involve
the
department
of
fisheries;
this
case
most
assuredly
does
not
involve
whether
traffic
lights
will
be
honored
in
the
streets
of
tacoma.
i
will
attempt
to
put
the
issue
in
context,
first
by
outlining
briefly
the
history
of
this
litigation
and
then
identifying
the
three
propositions
that
we
believe
are
decisive.
the
action
was
commenced
in
the
pierce
county’s
superior
court
back
in
1963
against
the
tribe
and
39
named
individuals.
the
litigation
initially
resulted
in
injunction
restraining
individual
tribal
members
from
net
fishing
for
steelhead
in
the
puyallup
river.
the
first
time
the
case
was
here,
this
court,
viewing
the
case
as
an
off-reservation
case
and
therefore
within
article
iii
of
the
treaty
--
i
will
be
talking
about
the
treaty
for
the
next
several
minutes;
it
is
reprinted
in
appendix
in
1(a)
of
our
brief
--
the
first
time
the
case
was
here,
this
was
viewed
as
an
off-reservation
case,
and
the
court
held
that
state
strictures
on
indian
net
fishing
could
be
justified
only
upon
conservation
grounds.
on
remand
for
the
first
time,
we
learned
that
the
game
department
read
"conservation"
as
permitting
a
total
prohibition
against
an
indian
net
fishery
if
you
called
it
a
conservation
ban.
now,
that
position
eventually
resolves
in
the
case
coming
back
here.
this
court
held
in
puyallup
ii
that
allocating
all
of
the
harvestable
steelhead
in
the
watershed
to
the
sportsmen
could
not
be
reconciled
with
the
treaty
language
of
article
iii.
again,
the
case
was
viewed
solely
as
an
off-reservation
case.
now,
before
this
case
went
to
trial
for
the
third
time
in
june
of
1974,
two
federal
decisions
were
handed
down
in
cases
initiated
by
the
united
states
involving
fishing
rights
of
the
puyallup
tribe
and
other
tribes
in
the
area.
both
of
these
cases
were
filed
early
in
the
1970s;
the
first
in
1970,
the
second
in
1971.
now,
the
first
of
these
cases,
united
states
v.
washington,
involves
virtually
all
aspects
of
treaty
fishing
rights
of
the
tribes
in
the
western
washington
region:
conservation,
allocation,
tribal
self-regulation
and
so
on.
that
decision,
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
certiorari
denied
here,
is
now
being
implemented
with
the
assistance
of
millions
of
dollars
of
congressional
appropriations.
now,
phase
ii
of
that
litigation,
scheduled
for
trial
next
year,
involves
claims
by
the
tribes
backed
again
by
the
united
states
of
treaty
entitlement
to
hatchery
fish.
this
is
basically
now
the
litigation
involves
all
tribes,
all
species,
all
of
the
watersheds
in
the
case
area
and
also
claims
with
regard
to
environmental
damage.
now,
the
second
federal
case
preceding
trial
here
is
also
denominated
united
states
v.
washington
and
is
the
so-called
puyallup
reservation
case.
now,
that
case
was
initiated
by
united
states
in
1971
directly
in
response
to
footnote
1
of
this
court’s
decision
in
puyallup
i,
where
the
court
left
open
the
question
of
whether
the
reservation
had
been
terminated
or
extinguished.
that
case
was
litigated
on
a
complaint
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
tribe
had
exclusive
right
to
regulate
the
fishery
within
the
reservation.
it
was
litigated
on
a
60-page
pretrial
order
contending
a
stipulation
of
facts
detailing
the
entire
history
of
the
reservation.
now,
that
litigation
resulted
in
a
holding
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
again
with
certiorari
denied
here,
that
the
reservation
continues
to
exist
and
that
the
tribe
has
a
right
to
fish
free
from
state
interference
on
the
river
within
that
reservation.
now,
with
this
background,
we
went
to
trial
for
a
third
time.
and
we
submit
that
three
propositions
emerge
as
decisive
of
the
single
question
presented
in
the
petition
here:
proposition
1,
the
puyallup
reservation
continues
to
exist.
this
proposition,
litigated
in
the
ninth
circuit
only
a
month
before
trial
in
this
case,
was
conceded
by
counsel
for
the
state
throughout
the
trial,
found
as
fact
by
the
trial
court,
accepted
as
fact
by
the
state
supreme
court;
proposition
2,
we
are
dealing
with
an
on-reservation
fishery.
the
facts,
again
as
found
by
the
trial
court,
recognized
and
accepted
by
the
state
supreme
court,
is
that
substantially
all
of
the
tribe's
future
steelhead
fishery
will
occur
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
both
of
those
propositions
established
by
the
findings
below;
we
then
reach
proposition
3,
which
is
decisive
here.
that
proposition
is
found
in
article
ii
of
the
treaty.
article
ii
reserves
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
tribe
the
reservation
properties
there
depicted,
including,
of
course,
the
river,
which
is
directly
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
we
submit
that
article
ii
must
be
read
as
reserving
to
the
tribe
exclusive
power
and
control
to
regulate
its
own
members
on
reservation
fisheries.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
both
propositions
are
presented
here.
we
present
them
both
in
a
jurisdictional
sense
and
in
a
sense
with
regard
to
the
merits.
we
do
believe
that
the
argument
that
i
am
submitting
here,
namely,
a
pre-emption
argument,
is
basically
a
jurisdictional
argument;
that
is,
we
feel
that
article
ii
of
the
treaty
pre-empts
from
state
authorities
any
and
all
power
to
adjudicate
and
to
regulate
that
on-reservation
fishery.
so
we
read
that
as
being
jurisdictional
in
that
sense.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
your
honor,
that
would
be
the
case
except
there
are
qualifications
with
regard
to
individual
indians;
namely,
other
provisions
of
federal
law,
perhaps
the
indian
civil
rights
act,
but
basically
we
think
that
that
pre-emptive
argument
would
apply
to
the
individuals,
as
well.
we
have
here,
of
course,
the
second
issues
of
sovereign
immunity,
which
depends
in
part
upon
that
characterization.
now,
all
of
that
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
i
cannot,
your
honor,
except
that
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
the
findings
below
were
accepted,
namely,
that
the
ninth
circuit
reservation
decision
recognized
by
the
state
throughout
as
being
dispositive
on
the
status
of
the
reservation
was
accepted
by
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
question
earlier
addressed
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
has
been
waived
both
by
the
state
by
accepting
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
federal
courts.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
right
your
honor.
but
basically
we
feel
that
the
--
your
question
may
be
whether
it
is
a
matter
of
the
law
of
the
case
that
the
reservation
does
not
exist.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
well,
this
court
specifically
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
this
court,
however,
did
indicate
that
the
question
of
the
reservation
question
was
not
being
resolved.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
this
court
also
indicated
the
same
proposition
in
the
satiacom
case
five
years
later,
recognizing
the
unresolved
nature
of
that
proposition;
then
the
federal
court
litigation
ensued.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
believe
the
acceptance
of
that
litigation
by
state
authorities
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
well,
in
my
rebuttal
time,
i
will
address
that.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
the
reservation
boundary
does
reach
suburban
tacoma.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
of
course
the
fishery,
there
remains
in
the
reservation
lands
in
trust
status,
and
we
believe
that
that
characterization
would
apply,
as
well,
to
the
riverbed
in
the
case.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
question
of
res
judicata
is
fairly
within
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
we
believe
that
that
ought
to
be
read
as
fairly
embracing
the
issues
that
would
be
dispositive
and,
of
course,
in
our
petition
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
your
honor,
the
res
judicata
issue,
we
believe,
because
it
does
establish
the
reservation,
should
be
recognized
as
binding
and
controlling
in
this
case.
and
in
fact,
in
our
petition,
we
did
address
and
indeed
argue
res
judicata
in
the
body
of
the
petition.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
i
am
prepared
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
it
would
be
a
federal
question.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
because
the
res
judicata
effect
to
be
accorded
that
federal
judgment,
although
not
directly
covered
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute,
we
would
submit
presents
a
federal
question
under
principles
of
the
supremacy,
basically
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
and
that
does
not
address
that
proposition.
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
spell
it
out
in
the
brief,
but
we
believe
that
the
issue
is
a
federal
issue
for
the
reason
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
as
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief,
your
honor,
the
--
well,
we
do
not
have
case
authority
for
that
proposition.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
on
two
issues.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct.
on
two
issues,
we
believe
the
reservation
status,
and
that
we
believe
was
accepted
by
the
courts
below.
the
second
issue,
the
question
of
the
power
to
regulate
on
reservation,
we
believe
is
also
a
preclusive.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
we
cite
res
judicata
cases,
including,
in
fact,
one,
the
city
of
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct.
no,
we
do
cite
a
case
book
in
which
that
question
is
addressed.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
it
is
a
very
interesting
question,
because
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
does
not
address
it
directly.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
we
believe
that
it
could
well
be
argued
that
the
preclusive
effect
to
be
accorded
federal
judgments
in
light
of
the
supremacy
clause
ought
well
to
be
governed
by
federal
law.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
this
court
clearly
if
it
desired
could
go
on
to
decide
the
reservation
question.
i
submit
that
would
be
unacceptable
here
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
the
first
time
in
this
litigation
the
status
of
the
reservation
has
been
raised
has
been
in
the
state's
brief
here.
basically,
because
they
have
conceded,
we
have
not
addressed
the
existence
of
the
reservation.
we
have
not
addressed
the
host
of
material
that
is
relevant
to
that
disposition.
secondly,
if
indeed,
let
us
say,
the
court
were
inclined
to
remand
for
a
decision
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
would
be
my
next
point;
but
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
remand,
what
we
would
do
again
is
to
plead
res
judicata
of
the
federal
judgment,
and
you
would
then
have
the
entire
record
of
the
ninth
circuit
case
back
here
a
fourth
time,
and
the
issue
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
more
importantly,
however,
we
think
this
is
a
decisive
proposition.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
well,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
we
submit
that
is
not
the
law
of
the
case,
and
it
was
recognized
as
not
the
law
of
the
case
by
both
the
state
in
the
course
of
litigation
and
by
the
courts.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
let
me
say
also
that
the
decision
on
--
there
is
no
version
of
this
reservation,
however
narrowly
diminished,
that
would
change
the
result
of
this
case.
for
that
reason,
basically
the
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
the
only
version
that
could
change
the
result
of
this
case,
and
we
say
that
because
the
river,
part
of
the
original
reservation,
we
believe
to
be
trust
land;
and
therefore,
the
fishing
is
occurring
on
trust
land
within
that
river;
and
if
the
reservation
hypothetically
were
diminished
to
the
point
that
all
that
remained
were
the
tribe's
agency
tract,
then
even
on
that
supposition,
we
submit
there
is
total
authority
to
regulate
the
tribal
fishery.
now,
i
say
"total
authority".
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
state
has
that
power.
that
issue,
we
submit,
has
been
conceded
by
the
state
in
litigation
for
30
years.
there
is
no
question
here
about
the
federal
supervision
that
might
be
imposed
upon
the
tribe’s
regulation
of
this
fishery.
indeed,
the
congress
obviously
could
have
a
role
to
play
here.
we
concede
that
under
some
circumstances,
the
federal
district
court
might
exercise
jurisdiction
over
on-reservation
fisheries.
the
same
may
be
true
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
the
question
is
whether
the
state
can
exercise
its
power
and
authority
with
regard
to
an
on-reservation
fishery.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
simply
for
the
reason,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct.
a
termination
decision
here
would
support
the
judgment
below,
that
is
correct.
now,
the
reason
we
say,
of
course,
that
it
should
not
and
could
not
be
resolved
here
is
that
the
record
is
not
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
was
conceded.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
yes,
the
state
court
has
addressed
the
question.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
there
were
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
court
that
the
reservation
continues
to
exist,
that
seven
miles
of
the
stretch
of
the
river
is
within
that
reservation.
those
findings,
incidentally,
and
this
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
they
were
certainly
--
they
were
reviewed;
but
that
particular
finding,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
extent
of
the
reservation
is
accepted
by
implication,
but
i
think
necessarily
by
the
four-judge
concurring
opinion,
which
concludes
that
this
fishery,
substantially
all
of
it,
occurs
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
now,
that
is
accepted
by
the
four
judges
reviewing
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no
--
well,
i
would
say
they
are
not
entitled
for
the
reason
that
they
have
never
raised
it
before;
they
have
never
given
me
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
any
evidence
that
they
might
present;
they
have
never
led
me
to
believe
that
the
60-page
stipulation
of
fact,
which
is
in
the
federal
court
record,
is
to
be
contradicted
and
reconsidered
here.
i
would
think
that
if
that
reservation
issue
were
to
come
up,
the
necessary
disposition
would
be
a
remand.
and
as
i
have
indicated
to
earlier
questions
from
the
court,
it
is
perfectly
satisfactory
and
easy,
we
believe,
to
recognize
that
with
the
sole
exception
of
a
termination
decision,
which
we
do
not
think
would
conceivably
be
justified,
the
remand
would
result
in
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
the
initial
action,
although
i
am
shifting
ground
slightly,
the
initial
action
was
based
upon
the
supposition
that
we
were
dealing
with
off-reservation
fishery
and
that
we
were
suing
individual
tribes.
i
would
submit
when
it
become
clear
that
we
were
dealing
with
an
on-reservation
fishery,
well,
that
is
basically
the
status
of
the
litigation
in
puyallup
iii,
when
it
become
clear
we
were
dealing
with
an
on-reservation
fishery
first
and,
secondly,
when
it
became
clear
that
we
were
not
talking
about
a
lawsuit
against
individuals,
but
rather
a
suit
against
the
tribe,
on
two
grounds,
the
article
ii
ground
and
on
the
sovereign-immunity
ground
the
state
courts
are
without
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
the
tribe
has
always
been
in,
your
honor;
but
the
court
orders
do
not
go
in
the
earlier
litigation
to
the
tribe
in
any
particular.
the
judgment
and
the
order
in
this
case
basically
controls
all
aspects
of
tribal
fishing,
and
i
use
that
"all
aspects"
advisably.
the
orders
go
to
the
tribe.
they
involve
reporting,
allocation,
closures
--
essentially
all
there
is
to
do
with
regard
to
fishing
--
and
that
is
the
significant
difference
between
a
case
involving
individuals
and
a
case
involving
the
tribe
and
the
sovereign
status
of
the
tribe,
which,
of
course,
is
what
is
behind
the
sovereign-immunity
doctrine.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
the
60-page
stipulation
goes
into
considerable
detail
on
the
entire
history
of
the
reservation.
do
you
wish
me,
your
honor,
to
address
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
we
believe
the
--
well,
it
indicates
that
a
reservation-status
decision,
indeed
as
all
of
the
reservation-status
cases
of
this
court
have
indicated,
requires
a
close
look
at
the
history
of
the
reservation.
it
requires
a
close
look
at
all
of
the
legislation,
the
legislative
history
and
department
practices
and
so
on.
one
of
the
facts
in
that
stipulation
is
the
fact
that
ever
since
the
reorganization
act
in
1936,
both
the
department
of
interior
and
the
department
of
justice
have
considered
the
puyallup
reservation
to
be
extant.
and
we
submit,
more
importantly
--
well,
let
me
turn
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
the
record
of
this
case
indicates
the
numbers
of
tribal
fishermen
and
the
extent
of
support.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
in
puyallup,
i
do
not
recall
that
there
were
numbers
of
fishermen
addressed
there.
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
there
are
60
fishermen.
their
fishing
activities
support
up
to
150
members
of
the
tribe,
which
is
a
substantial
percentage
of
the
tribal
membership.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
20
full-time,
20
part-time,
20
occasional.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
direct
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
the
position
of
the
state
with
regard
to
the
reservation
question
is
as
follows
--
i
am
reading
from
pages
20
and
21
of
the
appendix
--
we
take
the
position
first
that
we
have
to
operate
on
the
premise
that
there
is
a
reservation
unless
the
united
states
supreme
court
ran
certiorari
on
that
question
and
reverses
the
same,
and
that
question
can
only
be
resolved
by
that
format;
and
the
failure
to
take
certiorari
or
taking
so
failure
to
overturn
the
ninth
circuit,
the
reservation
is
there
and
we
must
observe
it.
but
what
we
are
asking
first
--
i
am
reading
further
to
indicate
to
the
court
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
i
am
reading
from
the
appendix,
pages
20
and
21,
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor.
i
am
reading
further
with
regard
to
the
natural
hatchery
issue.
this
is
from
counsel’s
opening
statement
before
the
trial
court
in
puyallup
iii:
what
we
are
asking
first
by
this
court
is
to
determine
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
terms
of
the
treaty
right
between
natively
propagated
steelhead
and
those
which
are
hatchery-planted.
now,
that
concept,
since
we
only
have
jurisdiction
off-reservation,
is
only
material
to
the
on-reservation
fishery.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
excuse
me,
is
only
material
to
the
off-reservation
fishery.
here,
we
have
an
on-reservation
fishery.
the
natural
hatchery
question
is
not
presented.
the
entire
question
of
treaty
entitlement
to
hatchery
fish
is
presently
pending
before
judge
bolt.
my
proof
on
this
question,
and
if
i
did
bring
it
here
was
curtailed
repeatedly
by
exclusions
of
evidence
in
a
nonjury
trial
dealing
with
competition
between
natural
and
hatchery
fish,
environmental
damage.
for
example,
the
position
of
the
state
on
this
question
is
that
if
simply
the
run
were
destroyed,
the
natural
run
were
entirely
destroyed
and
replaced
by
a
hatchery
run,
then
basically
there
is
no
more
treaty
entitlement
to
that
fish.
secondly,
on
the
sovereign-immunity
question,
the
attorney
general
has
understated
the
issue
substantially.
basically
on
the
sovereign-immunity
issue,
if
this
court
affirms,
you
are
opening
up
litigation
against
a
tribe
to
allocate
and
apportion
its
natural
resources
in
state
courts
throughout
the
state
of
washington.
the
congress
has
never
permitted
such
a
lawsuit,
and
i
submit
that
if
there
is
an
affirmance
on
that
sovereign-immunity
proposition,
the
effects
would
be
devastating.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
absolutely
not.
again
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
i
believe,
the
sovereign-immunity
defense
would
apply
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
claim.
they
are
suing
the
tribe,
and
they
have
secured
orders
against
the
tribe.
the
so-called
petty
orders
include
directives
to
the
tribal
council
of
the
close
fisheries
under
threat
of
contempt.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
the
allocation
issue
is
as
follows:
basically,
there
is
an
off-reservation,
the
bolt
decision
indicates
a
50/50
allocation
question.
the
court
below
allocated
on
a
45/55
basis;
for
our
purposes,
that
is
insignificant.
there
is
a
further
question
whether
the
hatchery
fish
are
excluded.
presently,
under
federal
court
order
pending
adjudication
of
this
entire
question
in
phase
ii
of
united
states
against
washington,
the
state
is
enjoined
from
excluding
hatchery
fish
from
its
regulatory
activity
with
regard
to
all
runs,
including
the
puyallup
river.
now,
that
meant,
again
in
response
to
another
question,
that
there
indeed
is
a
possibility
of
federal/state
injunctions,
and
this
court
has
looked
with
a
lack
of
encouragement
to
that
activity,
and
we
have
had
alternatives
and
occasionally
have
gone
before
the
federal
court
to
seek
injunctive
relief.
but
on
this
question,
on
the
question
of
state
power
to
control
on-reservation,
we
have
come
up
through
direct
appeals.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
sovereign
immunity,
your
honor,
has
been
asserted
in
this
litigation
ever
since
the
case
began.
it
was
rejected
in
puyallup
i
on
the
premise
that
we
were
dealing
with
an
action
against
individuals
off-reservation.
that
premise
has
now
dissipated.
it
has
been
urged
throughout
here
and
was
decided
against
us
on
the
merits
by
the
washington
state
supreme
court.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
but
to
do
that,
your
honor,
as
the
concurring
opinion
below
indicates,
you
have
to
read
puyallup
ii
as
contradicting
150
years
of
indian
law.
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
and
we
believe
that
you
cannot
do
that.
in
conclusion
of
what
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
because
those
cases
based
upon
the
premises
established
--
and
indeed,
they
were
facts
--
and
those
cases
were
off-reservation
cases
involving
individual
indians
--
mr.
william
h.
rodgers,
jr.
except
the
reservation
now
exists,
and
the
orders
that
initially
run
against
individuals
now
run
against
the
tribe.
the
tribal
council,
the
tribal
governing
body,
its
legislative
body,
has
been
ordered
to
enact
closures,
to
enforce
closures.
the
case
has
been
transformed
into
an
off-reservation
individual
case
into
an
on-reservation
suit
against
the
tribe
itself.
and
i
would
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
history
of
this
litigation
has
been
determined
by
one
overriding
factor,
and
that
is
to
restrict
the
indian
fishery.
we
have
had
in
this
case
argued
at
various
times
that
the
tribe
is
defunct,
that
the
treaty
is
a
worthless
scrap
of
paper,
that
the
reservation
does
not
exist,
but
that
if
it
does
there
is
power
to
control
as
if
it
did
not.
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse.
we
urge
the
court
to
go
further
and
to
dismiss
on
the
ground,
we
fear,
that
the
slightest
ambiguity
in
its
disposition
will
result
in
additional
litigation.
thank
you.
