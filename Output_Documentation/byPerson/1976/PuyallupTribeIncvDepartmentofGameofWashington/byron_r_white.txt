justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rodgers,
you
said
proposition
1
allows
that
the
reservation
still
exists
and
has
not
been
terminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that,
you
say,
was
accepted
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
offhand
where
in
its
opinion
that
factual
proposition
is
accepted
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
in
the
first
puyallup
case,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
indicated
that
the
reservation
had
been
terminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
not
decided
by
this
court
in
the
first
puyallup.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
do
not
have
the
ninth
circuit
here.
this
comes
from
the
state
of
washington.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
ninth
circuit
was
in
a
different
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
litigation,
that
is,
as
it
began
many
years
ago
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
first
puyallup
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
the
court
held
--
and
you
correct
me
if
i
am
mistaken
--
that
the
reservation
had
been
terminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
holding
was
not
disturbed
by
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
said
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
individuals
fishing,
individual
indians
fishing
off-reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
different
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
rather
important.
you
said
proposition
1
was
that
the
reservation
has
not
been
terminated
and,
moreover,
that
that
has
been
accepted
in
this
case
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
i
am
interested
to
know
where
it
accepted
it.
on
the
other
hand,
i
do
not
want
to
tie
you
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
this
is
--
we
are
talking
about
suburban
tacoma,
aren’t
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
inside
the
city
limits,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
argument
is,
though,
that
the
state
of
washington
was
constitutionally
bound
by
a
decision
of
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
an
issue
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
no
cases.
you
have
no
support
for
that
proposition.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
are
not
citing
anything
that
says
that
a
state
is
constitutionally
bound
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
case
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
not
an
issue;
it
is
not
an
issue
that
was
raised
in
state
court
in
this
litigation,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
court
has
not
addressed
the
question
in
this
decision,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
those
findings
reviewed
in
the
appellate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
except
for
the
res
judicata
point,
you
would
say
the
state
is
entitled
to
--
because
they
responded
to
argue
the
reservation
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
third,
that
the
fishing
in
this
case
goes
on
on
the
reservation,
if
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
premise
of
puyallup
i
was
that
these
were
individual
indians
fishing
off
the
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
had
never
been
raised
in
the
state
court
or
never
decided
by
any
court?
then
is
the
respondent
free
to
raise
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
true
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
order
to
review
an
issue,
doesn't
it
have
to
have
been
decided
in
--
or
must
it
not
have
been
at
least
raised
at
some
point
in
the
state
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
was
not
decided
below,
the
respondent
may
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
federal
court
enjoin
the
state
officers
from
acting
inconsistently
with
judge
bolt’s
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
including
enjoining
them
from
further
litigation
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren’t
the
state
authorities
asserting
rights
contrary
to
what
judge
bolt
said
they
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
he
enjoin
them?
could
he
enjoin
them
from
further
litigation
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
they
come
back
to,
the
hatchery
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
hatchery
is
above
the
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
planted
them
up
--
i
see,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
long
enough
to
do
a
lot
of
fishing.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
talking
about
specific
fish,
surely.
you
must
be
now
talking
about
an
allocation,
a
fair
allocation,
essentially.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
their
descendents.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
a
decision
on
fishing
rights
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit
on
fishing
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
in
the
case
they
are
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
says
on
the
reservation,
the
state
cannot
limit
their
fishing,
judge
bolt.
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
bolt.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
united
states
gives
a
cite
at
page
--
job
cite
to
it
here
that
he
decided
that
on-reservation
fishing
is
not
subject
to
state
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
the
basis
of
the
45%
allocation
of
the
non-hatchery
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
basis
of
the
45%
allocation
of
the
non-hatchery
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
to
protect
the
indians
or
to
protect
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
may
also
be
a
limit
on
what
they
could
take.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
so
it
was
a
limit
on
what
they
could
take
by
a
net
commercial
fishery.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
also
an
allocation
that
they
could
take
at
least
that
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
state's
position
with
respect
to
the
reservation
question,
mr.
attorney
general,
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
raised
in
the
cite
below
or
whether
you
conceded
it
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
reach
issues
that
were
not
decided
by
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
did
not
present
that
issue
to
the
washington
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
was
neither
presented
nor
decided
by
the
washington
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
that
court
thought
it
was
doing
no
more
than
obeying
the
order
on
remand
of
this
court
in
puyallup
ii.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
instead
of
the
wide
precedent
that
you
have
indicated
that
affirmance
here
might
mean,
really,
this
is
just
limited
to
the
washington
supreme
court’s
carrying
out
what
this
court
told
it
to
do
on
remand
of
this
particular
and
precise
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
same
case
as
this
case.
