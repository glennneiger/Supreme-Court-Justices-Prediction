mr.
slade
gorton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
perhaps
should
address
myself
first
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
stewart
just
asked
of
my
co-counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
order
of
our
presentation
on
these
hatchery
fish
would
be
this:
first,
that
hatchery
fishery
are
not
subject
to
treaty
rights
at
all;
therefore,
public
law
280
does
not
save
the
reservation,
even
if
it
exists,
from
state
jurisdiction,
because
the
state
is
prohibited
jurisdiction
on
such
a
reservation
only
in
connection
with
treaty
fishing
rights.
if
these
are
not
treaty
fishing
rights,
they
are
not
protected
from
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
the
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
my
opponents
say
that
you
cannot
get
to
that
question;
that
you
should
not
decide
that
question
at
all.
we
feel
that
it
is
a
central
point
in
this
case.
it
has,
of
course,
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
three
members
of
this
court
in
puyallup
ii
had
that
as
a
part
of
their
concurring
opinion.
mr.
slade
gorton
exactly.
when
the
treaty
--
mr.
slade
gorton
if
that
is
a
natural
fish,
i
think
that
the
tribe
has
both
to
the
benefit
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
slade
gorton
if
the
state
creates
a
new
breed
of
fish,
that
would
have
exactly
the
same
rights
as
the
hatchery
steelhead
do.
the
treaty
itself
--
mr.
slade
gorton
the
treaty
is
limited
to
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
natural
fish.
mr.
slade
gorton
and
their
descendents.
moreover,
the
treaty
includes
language
that
implies
this,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
the
treaty
makes
it
a
specific
exemption
for
cultivated
shellfish,
which
was
something
which
was
done
artificially
in
1854,
and
it
excludes
from
the
treaty
the
only
type
of
marine
life
which
was
then
cultivated.
so
the
obvious
intention
of
the
treaty
would
be
to
treat
something
new
--
mr.
slade
gorton
if
there
was
something
else
to
include,
your
honor;
but
not
when
that
something
else
did
not
exist
until
1950,
100
years
after
the
treaty
was
written.
throughout
these
entire
proceedings,
the
state
has
sought
to
control
violations
of
conservation
laws
by
individual
fishermen,
and
that
is
exactly
the
way
this
court
characterized
this
case
in
puyallup
ii.
the
nature
of
the
case
has
not
changed
since
that
decision.
individual
defendants
were
involved
in
puyallup
ii
and
in
puyallup
iii,
once
named
in
the
caption
of
the
case.
it
was
also
in
puyallup
ii
and
shown
by
the
record
to
have
engaged
in
fishing
activities,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
present
in
court
here
today.
counsel
for
other
individual
members
of
the
tribe
who
were
involved
in
puyallup
ii
were
served
with
the
initial
petition
at
the
beginning
of
puyallup
iii,
but
failed
to
appear,
evidently
feeling
that
the
tribal
attorneys
and
the
united
states
would
defend
their
rights.
no
general
form
of
relief
was
cited
in
puyallup
iii
which
was
not
involved
in
puyallup
i.
we
simply
seek
a
definition
of
the
conservation
rights
which
the
state
has
with
respect
to
migratory
steelhead
and
the
means
by
which
the
state
may
enforce
those
rights.
the
petition
--
mr.
slade
gorton
enlarged
the
natural
run?
mr.
slade
gorton
i
would
not
make
that
contention.
mr.
slade
gorton
well,
it
is
a
question
of
where
the
funds
come
from
in
the
sense
that
these
funds
were
used
to
create
a
run,
which
is
an
addition.
it
is
shown
by
the
record
to
be
an
addition
to
the
maximum
natural
run.
if
these
were
simply
state
funds
to
improve
river
quality,
no,
we
would
not
--
mr.
slade
gorton
under
those
circumstances,
we
would
make
the
same
claim.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
not
critical
to
my
argument.
it
might
have
been
to
mr.
willner's.
mr.
slade
gorton
he
emphasizes
that,
because
he
represents
the
people
who
may
pay
those
fees.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
may.
we
have
asked
in
puyallup
iii
for
a
declaratory
judgment
stating
our
authority
to
enforce
reasonable
conservation
regulations
upon
individual
members
of
the
tribe.
now,
in
addition,
the
trial
court
did
grant
two
elements
of
limited
relief
against
the
tribe
itself,
and
this
seems
to
be
the
whole
basis
of
the
claim
that
you
must
dismiss
the
entire
litigation.
first,
it
required
the
tribe
to
file
a
list
of
the
names
of
authorized
tribal
fishermen,
hardly
an
onerous
task;
second,
that
it
supply
weekly
catch
figures
during
the
course
of
the
season.
it
is
really
only
on
the
basis
of
these
additional
elements
of
relief
that
the
tribe
seeks
dismissal
of
the
entire
action
on
sovereign-immunity
grounds,
claiming
that
this
is
destructive
of
tribal
self-government.
even
if
the
court
finds
that
this
rather
incidental
specific
ruling
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity,
it
is
certainly
not
precluded
from
dealing
with
the
merits
of
the
decision
which
it
directed
the
washington
supreme
court
to
make
and
from
affirming
the
enforcement
of
those
decisions
against
individual
tribal
members,
it
seems
to
us.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
is
clearly
the
former,
your
honor,
by
reason
of
the
argument
to
which
mr.
willner
referred
to,
that
this
same
counsel
are
now
making
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction,
either.
in
other
words,
in
direct
defiance
of
the
nine-judge
opinion
in
puyallup
ii,
it
is
the
essential
legal
claim
of
the
tribe
that
they
do
have
the
right
to
pursue
the
last
living
steelhead
into
their
nest
and
that
no
court,
state
or
federal,
has
any
right
to
interfere
with
that
activity.
so
the
answer
may
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
they
do
not
concede
that
the
united
states
could
bring
a
suit
against
them.
they
concede
only
that
the
congress
can
change
the
law;
but
their
position
today
is
that
you
cannot
control
their
fishery,
even
if
the
united
states
has
sued
them,
and
that
is
exactly
what
my
brother
counsel
here
was
reading.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
my
colleague
here
was
reading
from
that
brief,
i
am
sorry.
the
question
of
the
existence
and
extent
of
the
reservation
has
been
raised.
i
wish
to
preface
my
comments
on
that
subject
by
stating
that
it
has
been
the
consistent
position
of
this
court,
and
may
very
well
be
the
strongest
single
law
of
the
case
argument,
that
the
existence
or
nonexistence
or
extent
of
this
reservation
is
simply
irrelevant.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
that
your
decision
in
puyallup
i,
mr.
justice
stewart,
went
considerably
further
than
that.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
did
so,
but
it
also
said
something
else.
it
dealt
with
the
fact
that
the
washington
supreme
court
had
found
the
reservation
to
be
terminated
and
even
set
out
some
of
the
reasons
which
the
washington
supreme
court
utilized.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
you
did
not
need
to
get
to
that
question,
because
the
only
fishing
rights
which
the
puyallup
tribe
had
were
those
which
it
had
received
under
article
iii
of
the
treaty,
which
is
the
usual
and
accustomed
places
in
common
with
all
citizens
of
the
territory
language.
mr.
slade
gorton
and
therefore,
the
implication
was,
that
it
did
not
make
any
difference;
their
on-reservation
rights
and
their
off-reservation
rights
were
the
same.
now,
in
the
first
two
cases
which
this
court
considered
on
this
kind
of
treaty
--
remember,
there
are
a
dozen
or
so
treaties
of
washington
and
oregon
with
similar
language,
all
made
in
the
same
year
or
year-and-a-half
period
--
dealt
with
the
yakima
tribe
in
both
the
waynan’s
case
and
the
tuli
case.
the
treaty
in
those
cases
has
a
separate
and
explicit
exclusive
on-reservation
fishery
right
in
it,
which
the
puyallup
treaty
does
not
and
which
presumably
was
the
reason
that
mr.
justice
douglas,
writing
for
this
court
in
puyallup
i,
stated
that
only
article
iii
was
relevant.
now,
the
second
--
mr.
slade
gorton
you
effectively
have
three
allocation
formulas
that
are
involved
with
fisheries
on
the
puyallup
at
this
point.
you
have
judge
bolt’s,
which
has
been
described
here
by
the
solicitor's
office.
you
have
the
trial
court's
distribution,
45
%
to
this
relative
handful
of
indian
fishermen,
55
%
of
the
natural
run
to
the
other
citizens
of
the
state,
which
our
supreme
court
has
affirmed.
but
it
affirmed
that
with
a
troubled
mind.
it
felt
that
it
has
misled
this
court
in
puyallup
ii
in
indicating
that
there
was
any
apportionment
required
at
all.
you
found
in
puyallup
ii
that
an
apportionment
was
required,
because
a
non-indian
sports
fishery
entirely
pre-empted
the
run.
that
was
not
true
then,
and
it
is
clearly
not
true
in
the
record
now.
the
indians
have
the
right
to
a
sports
fishery.
they
have
a
slightly
better
right
than
non-indians,
because
they
need
not
buy
a
license
for
it.
and
in
fact,
they
engage
in
the
sports
fishery.
so
the
state
supreme
court
is
asking
you
in
addition
to
tell
whether
or
not
the
language,
the
right-to-fish
language
in
common
with
all
citizens
requires
an
apportionment
at
all
when
there
is
no
discrimination
and
when
the
access
to
and
the
rights
to
the
fish
are
the
same
for
the
indian
group
as
they
are
for
the
non-indian
group.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
was,
of
course,
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i
think
in
order
to
persuade
you
that
your
decision
in
puyallup
ii
was
incorrect,
because
you
did
not
have
the
facts
in
front
of
you.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
in
puyallup
i,
you
did
not
require
an
apportionment.
it
was
not
until
puyallup
ii
that
you
required
an
apportionment.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
sorry,
i
missed
your
question.
mr.
slade
gorton
puyallup
i
did
not
construe
the
treaty
in
that
respect
at
all
--
mr.
slade
gorton
--
because
the
state
supreme
court
in
puyallup
i
had
already
vacated
the
trial
court's
judgment
on
allocation;
and
so
you
had
no
allocation
in
front
of
you
in
puyallup
i,
and
you
quite
specifically
stated
that
you
were
not
going
to
attempt
in
puyallup
i
to
say
whether
an
allocation
was
required.
in
puyallup
ii,
you
did
so.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am,
and
there
is
a
considerable
section
of
our
brief
which
is
devoted
very
precisely
to
that
argument,
because
we
feel,
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
did,
that
our
record
was
incomplete
and
our
state
supreme
court
made
a
misstatement
in
its
decision
in
puyallup
ii,
which
led
you
to
feel
that
there
was
discrimination;
that
only
non-indians
could
engage
in
the
sports
fishery
and
that
therefore
an
allocation
or
apportionment
was
required.
that
is
simply
not
the
case,
and
this
record
shows
that
not
to
be
the
case.
they
do,
in
fact,
engage
with
others
in
a
sports
fishery.
the
next
that
i
was
going
to
before
your
series
of
questions
began
was
the
question
of
the
reservation
itself.
now,
the
question
of
the
reservation
itself
is
a
somewhat
more
narrow
one
than
you
have
been
led
to
believe
by
counsel
on
the
other
side
of
this
case.
even
if
--
we
do
not
concede
--
that
you
cannot
even
deal
with
the
termination
question
at
all
because
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
all
the
ninth
circuit
said
was
that
the
reservation
had
not
been
terminated.
inspite
of
the
statements
by
counsel
on
the
other
side,
there
was
no
fishing-rights
issue
in
that
case
whatsoever.
it
was
solely
on
whether
or
not
there
had
been
termination.
as
it
started,
there
was
an
alternate
claim
by
the
state
that
there
had
been
determination
or
diminishment.
the
district
court
ruled
that
there
had
been
determination
three
years
ago,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
said
there
had
not
been
determination
and
sent
it
back
to
the
federal
district
court
in
tacoma.
the
united
states
has
not
pursued
that
case
--
it
does
not
even
have
a
judgment
in
it
yet
--
but
it
certainly
has
not
pursued
any
attempt
to
say
what
is
included
within
the
reservation.
this
court,
in
puyallup
i,
effectively
said
what
is
included
in
the
reservation:
22
acres
of
a
cemetery.
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
about
where
the
reservation
is,
and
the
former
or
the
supposed
reservation
is
shown
in
a
map
which
is
at
the
back
of
our
brief.
the
lines
on
that
map
--
unfortunately
since
it
is
a
transcription
of
a
color
map,
there
is
some
difficulty
with
it
--
but
all
the
lines
that
it
has
lightly
cross-hatched
is
on
18,000
acres
which
was
originally
in
the
reservation
back
in
the
middle
of
the
19th
century.
the
heavier
lines
are
the
city
limits
of
the
city
of
tacoma,
the
city
of
fife
and
there
is
a
portion
of
the
city
of
puyallup
and
other
suburban
areas
within
that
supposed
reservation.
but
there
has
been
no
determination
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
river
is
in
the
reservation
or
that
anything
is
in
the
reservation.
mr.
slade
gorton
that
was
in
the
introduction
to
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
slade
gorton
but
it
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
oh,
i
see.
excuse
me,
i
am
sorry.
the
complaint
of
the
united
states
in
the
case
did
raise
that
issue.
mr.
slade
gorton
and
the
quotation
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
here
quotes
its
complaint
in
front
of
the
whole
--
mr.
slade
gorton
yes,
but
i
think
that
case,
their
claim
is
based
most
heavily
on
the
decision
by
judge
bolt
rather
than
this,
because
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
very,
very
short
decision
simply
stated
that
the
reservation
had
not
been
terminated.
it
did
not
go
into
the
extent
of
the
reservation;
it
did
not
discuss
--
mr.
slade
gorton
there
has
been
a
decision.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
the
ninth
circuit
in
another
case
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was.
there
has
been
in
the
case
in
the
appeal
from
the
decision
by
judge
bolt;
but
in
that
decision,
of
course,
judge
bolt
had
specifically
reserved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
hatchery
fish
were
within
the
treaty
rights.
judge
bolt
had
the
benefit
of
this
court's
decision
in
puyallup
ii
before
he
made
his
decision.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
sorry,
whose?
mr.
slade
gorton
oh,
okay.
the
bolt
cases
that
came
up
did
not
concern
itself
with
on-reservation
fisheries.
judge
bolt
has
concerned
himself
from
the
beginning
of
this
case
with
off-reservation
fisheries.
i
am
sure
that
he
did
make
that
remark
in
passing;
but
all
he
--
mr.
slade
gorton
i
believe
that
that
is
correct
that
he
made
such
a
decision,
though
that
was
not
a
matter
which
was
argued
before
him;
it
was
not
a
general
subject
of
that
set
of
proceedings.
nonetheless,
this
court,
before
he
made
that
decision,
remanded
this
case
to
the
state
courts
to
make
just
such
determinations,
which
it
has,
of
course,
gone
on
and
done.
judge
bolt,
incidentally,
if
you
read
his
entire
decision,
takes
the
puyallup
i
and
puyallup
ii
cases,
says
in
effect
that
you
were
wrong,
although
he
gives
lip
service
to
following
it
and
uses
a
totally
different
apportionment
formula
than
that
which
you
set
out
in
puyallup
ii.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
am
sorry?
mr.
slade
gorton
i
have
some
difficulty
in
answering
that
question
precisely.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
would
be
to
protect
the
indians,
because
it
would
give
them
a
considerably
larger
percentage
of
the
natural
run.
mr.
slade
gorton
no.
it
was
only
a
limit
on
what
they
could
take
in
a
net
commercial
fishery.
it
did
not
limit
--
mr.
slade
gorton
by
a
net
commercial
fishery.
and
the
judge
decided
that
also
--
mr.
slade
gorton
at
least
that
much,
because
they
could
then
go
on
and
take
whatever
they
could
get
in
a
sports
fishery
in
common
with
all
of
the
non-indian
sportsmen.
mr.
slade
gorton
some
of
them
get
better
than
others,
and
i
think
--
well,
there
may
not
be
a
record
on
this
--
i
suspect
that
these
professional
indian
fishermen
are
better
than
the
average
amateur
sportsman;
but
they
will
get
some.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not
think
it
is
de
minimis.
they
have
caught
some
fish
in
a
sports
fishery.
it
is
not
a
productive
use
of
one’s
time
from
the
point
of
view
of
hourly
pay,
however,
to
fish
for
steelhead
on
a
hook-and-line
basis.
mr.
slade
gorton
i
do
not
think
there
is
any.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
river
is
on
a
new
alignment
now
from
what
it
was
at
the
time
the
treaty
was
signed.
it
was
realigned
in
the
1920s
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
the
trust
properly
is
shown
in
the
record
--
mr.
slade
gorton
if
the
reservation
is
not
in
existence,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
indian
property
or
any
indian
trust
property
on
the
river
at
all.
the
22
acres
are
a
cemetery,
which
are
located
off
the
river.
mr.
slade
gorton
yes.
yes,
the
puyallup
river
runs
in
a
--
mr.
slade
gorton
that
is
one
of
the
questions,
your
honor.
that
is
what
was
the
original
reservation;
but
mr.
justice
white’s
question
to
me
was,
what
indian-owned
land
or
indian-trust
land
is
there
on
the
banks
of
the
river?
and
my
answer
to
that
question
was,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
none.
mr.
slade
gorton
22
acres,
according
to
puyallup
i,
and
i
think
they
bought
a
few
acres
since
the
time
of
that.
2½%of
the
people
who
will
live
within
those
exterior
borders
are
indians,
and
97½%
are
non-indians.
since
i
must,
in
connection
with
the
reservation
question,
of
course,
is
your
decision
two
weeks
ago
on
the
rosebud
case.
we
have
analyzed
the
question
of
the
existence
of
the
reservation
in
connection
with
the
decoteau
case,
which
came
out
after
the
ninth
circuit
case
on
this.
mr.
slade
gorton
the
question
was
raised
in
puyallup
i,
was
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court
in
puyallup
i.
the
other
federal
court
case
intervened
in
that.
we
lost
that
case.
the
trial
court
in
this
case
acknowledged
what
the
ninth
circuit
had
decided.
i
think
it
resisted;
it
did
not
believe
that
that
was
a
correct
decision.
but
both
the
trial
court
decision
and
the
state
supreme
court
decision
proceeded
as
if
the
ninth
circuit
decision
on
lack
of
termination
was
correct.
and
we
can
argue
that
case
here,
it
was
an
issue.
it
was
brought
up
at
both
points,
and
we
can
raise
that
issue
here
only
in
respect
that
we
have
the
right
to
raise
any
issue
which
is
in
the
record
which
would
tend
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
it
reaches
an
issue
which
was
decided
by
the
--
mr.
slade
gorton
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
slade
gorton
it
was
presented
--
i
think
that
it
was
presented
by
the
united
states
in
both
cases.
it
had
to
be.
they
could
not
have
come
up
with
any
answer.
they
would
not
have
known
what
had
happened
under
any
other
circumstances.
mr.
slade
gorton
there
was
not
any
evidence
on
it
later
than
puyallup
i;
but
this
is
all
the
same
case,
of
course,
as
puyallup
i.
essentially
--
mr.
slade
gorton
oh,
i
think
that
if
we
go
to
the
record
in
this
case,
there
is
evidence
on
it.
that
evidence
takes
place
back
in
puyallup
i
and
is
the
evidence
in
the
decisions
of
the
u.s.
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
we
feel
that
this
case
being
here
for
the
third
time
that
all
of
the
issues
involved
in
the
decision
of
the
court
are
properly
before
you
and
that
you
ought
to
decide
it.
thank
you
very
much.
