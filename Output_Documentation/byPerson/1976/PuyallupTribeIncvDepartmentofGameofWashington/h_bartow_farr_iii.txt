mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
is
appearing
this
afternoon
in
support
of
the
position
of
the
puyallup
tribe
in
this
case,
and
that
position
is
that
the
puyallup
tribe
and
their
tribal
members
have
the
right
to
fish
for
steelhead
trout
within
the
confines
of
their
reservation
free
from
state
interference.
now,
this
position
self-evidently
embraces
two
necessary
propositions:
first,
that
there
is
a
reservation
and,
secondly,
that
the
state
may
not
exercise
its
power
over
indian
fishing
activities
within
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
the
fishing
that
we
are
arguing
in
this
case
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct,
and
the
arguments
that
i
am
discussing
this
morning
do
not
deal
with
whatever
indian
fishing
may
occur
off
the
reservation.
i
am
simply
talking
about
fishing
that
occurs
on
the
reservation.
i
would
like
in
view
of
the
discussions
this
morning
to
move
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
the
existence
of
the
reservation
is
properly
an
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
state
has
argued
at
length
in
its
brief
on
the
merits
that
there
is
no
puyallup
reservation.
the
outset
we
know
that
the
state
did
not
argue
this
point
at
all
in
puyallup
iii.
in
fact,
as
the
appendix
clearly
shows,
the
state
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
they
did
not
argue
it,
either,
before
the
state
superior
court
or
in
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
in
this
case,
puyallup
iii.
the
appendix
on
page
20
and
21,
in
fact,
indicates
that
counsel
for
this
state,
for
the
department
of
game,
said
that
unless
this
court
overturned
the
decision
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
reservation
case
holding
that
there
was
a
reservation
that
it
would
accept
that
decision.
the
washington
superior
court
in
puyallup
iii
on
page
c-39
of
the
appendix,
the
petition
for
certiorari,
noted
that
this
court
had
denied
certiorari
in
the
ninth
circuit
case
and
stated
that
it
would
accept
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
there
was
a
continuing
puyallup
reservation.
now,
the
washington
supreme
court
was
a
little
bit
less
specific;
but
on
page
b(6)
and
b(7)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
washington
supreme
court
stated,
"it
has
also
been
contended
that
the
recently
established
continuing
existence
of
the
puyallup
indian
reservation
--
"
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
page
b(6).
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
b
as
in
buffalo,
b(6)
of
the
first
sort
of
aqua-colored
volume.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
this
is
the
washington
supreme
court
again.
it
says,
"it
has
also
been
contended
that
the
recently
established
continuing
existence
of
the
puyallup
indian
reservation"
with
a
citation
to
the
ninth
circuit
case
and
this
court's
denial
of
certiorari,
"precludes
any
state
jurisdiction
over
activities
occurring
within
the
reservation
boundaries."
now,
the
court
does
not
then
go
on
to
comment
on
the
continued
existence
of
the
reservation,
but
then
discusses
the
right
to
control
fishing
on
the
reservation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
disagree,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
this
context,
mattz
v.
arnett,
of
course,
was
a
question
of
termination
of
reservation
boundaries.
but
they
are
talking
about
mattz
v.
arnett
in
this
context
not
on
that
issue,
but
the
fact
that
the
court
remanded,
leaving
open
in
their
minds
the
question
of
whether
even
though
the
reservation
did
still
exist
in
that
case,
whether
the
state
had
some
regulatory
authority
within
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
yes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
it
was
an
issue
in
puyallup
i.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
by
this
court,
it
has
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
in
this
case,
it
has
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
we
believe
that
it
is
an
open
question,
but
we
also
believe
it
is
not
a
question
properly
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
in
the
morning’s
argument
the
principle,
which
of
course
we
recognize,
that
a
respondent
can
urge
in
support
of
a
judgment
below
any
ground
that
supports
it,
even
though
not
relied
on
by
the
court
of
law.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
our
understanding
of
the
rule,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
it
is
an
issue
that
must
have
been
in
the
record
of
the
case
below
and,
in
fact,
this
court
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
we
do
not
believe
it
is
in
the
record
in
puyallup
iii.
the
only
thing
that
is
in
the
record
in
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
within
reason,
i
suppose,
that
is
true.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
had
understood
that
the
court’s
rule
in
this
case
was
actually
its
own
rule,
regardless
of
whether
washington
permitted
it
to
be
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
our
position
is
that
it
has
to
be
appearing
in
the
record.
that
is
the
language
from
langnes
in
289,
it
has
to
be
a
matter
appearing
in
the
record
to
be
responded
to
in
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
the
court
may
ignore
it.
for
instance,
the
state
of
washington
could
have
argued
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
reservation,
and
the
state
courts
could
have
ignored
it,
and
we
would
believe
that
in
that
case
that
the
issue
would
be
properly
in
front
of
this
court;
or
the
state
courts
could
have
said,
"we
disagree".
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
if
there
is
no
reservation
in
this
particular
case,
that
is
possibly
correct;
however,
there
is
another
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
there
is
a
separate
question
as
to
whether,
in
fact,
the
riverbed
is
trust
land
over
which
the
state
has
no
jurisdiction,
either.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
it
is
a
different
question
in
some
respects;
but
the
same
principles
of
jurisdiction
would
probably
apply.
so
it
would
not
necessarily
mean
if
the
court
concluded
there
were
no
reservation
that
the
state
would
have
jurisdiction
to
regulate
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
to
show
you
where
the
reservation
is?
my
understanding
is
that
there
is
not
a
map
in
this
record.
the
reservation
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
part
of
the
reservation
is
within
the
city
of
tacoma,
and
i
might
just
digress
for
a
second
to
point
out
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
the
river
runs
through
the
reservation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
i
do
not
know
precisely;
but
there
is
a
finding
of
the
state
superior
court
that
a
seven-mile
stretch
of
the
river
is
within
the
reservation.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
you
were
being
asked
to
pass
on
a
seven-mile
stretch
of
the
river,
which
is
in
the
reservation,
according
to
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
other
than
that,
i
do
not
know
where
it
is,
that
is
correct.
but
i
do
believe
it
is
fairly
embraced
within
the
reservation
boundaries.
now,
there
was
also
considerable
discussion
this
morning
about
the
res
judicata
question,
and
i
would
like
to
address
that
just
for
a
moment.
this
is
a
confusing
case
procedurally,
because
we
have
litigation
in
the
state
courts
and
litigation
proceeding
at
the
same
time
in
the
federal
courts,
and
the
judgments
between
the
two
courts
are
not
necessarily
consistent.
in
fact,
they
have
tended
to
be
inconsistent
on
most
issues.
our
position
is
that
the
judgment
issued
by
judge
bolt,
which
did
not
concern
the
existence
of
the
reservation,
but
simply
discussed
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
on
reservation,
and
which
concluded
that
the
state
did
not
have
regulation,
as
in
fact
the
state
conceded
and
has
conceded
throughout
the
litigation
in
this
case
and,
in
fact,
conceded
before
this
court
numerous
times
in
the
oral
argument
in
puyallup
ii.
we
believe
that
judge
bolt’s
decision
is
binding
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
on
the
state
courts.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
our
authority
for
that
is
that
that
was
litigation
between
the
same
parties.
we
are
not
relying
on
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
we
think
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
does
implement
the
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
--
res
judicata.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
all
right,
that
is
true.
i
think
that
it
does
extend
more
broadly
than
that;
but
if
it
does
not
then
i
do
agree
that
the
question
of
res
judicata
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
matter
of
overriding
federal
law.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
decided
that
they
did
not
address
the
res
judicata
question,
i
would
think
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
state
officers
that
are
parties
to
judge
bolt’s
case,
i
believe
it
could.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
do
not
know.
i
would
think
not,
because
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
the
judgment
that
would
prevent
further
litigation
of
this
matter
in
the
state
courts.
i
think
that
the
order
enforcing
the
judgment,
any
injunction
enforcing
the
judgment,
would
not
necessarily
reach
to
adjudication
of
different
rights.
so
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
the
type
of
order
that
they
would
issue.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
well,
they
are
asserting
them
in
this
litigation.
my
understanding
is
that
they
are
not
in
dis-advance
of
judge
bolt’s
decision
or,
if
they
are,
that
that
is
being
worked
out
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
do
not
know.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
i
do
not
know
of
any,
mr.
chief
justice,
no.
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
discuss
a
point
which
exists
independently
in
this
case
regardless
of
our
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
argument,
and
that
is
simply
the
question
of
state
power
to
regulate
on-reservation
fishing.
we
do
believe
that
the
state
courts
and
the
department
of
game
in
this
case
found
that
power
principally
in
the
remand
from
this
court
in
puyallup
ii,
which
we
think
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
puyallup
ii,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
was
an
off-reservation
fishing
case,
and
we
see
nothing
in
the
remand
which
required
the
state
to
take
regulatory
authority
on
the
reservation
or,
in
fact,
authorized
them
to
do
so
if
they
would
not
otherwise
have
jurisdiction.
i
should
recede
very
slightly
from
a
point
made
in
our
brief.
on
page
27,
we
indicated
that
the
state
of
washington
did
not
exercise
general,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
the
puyallup
reservation.
that
statement
is
not
completely
accurate,
because
it
is
too
broad.
they
have
exercised
in
a
1963
statute
general,
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indian
reservations
within
the
state
with
an
exception
for
indian
trust
lands
and
allotments
and
also
with
a
specific
exclusion
for
matters
affecting
indian
treaty
rights.
now,
the
state
suggests
in
its
brief,
at
page
47
now,
that
somehow
this
may
give
them
power;
but
i
think
they
would
be
forced
to
concede
that
is
a
power
that
they
have
never
before
claimed
under
that
act
--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
yes,
this
is
public
law
280
we
are
talking
about
--
not
over
this
matter,
clearly
not
over
this
matter
in
our
opinion.
but
the
city
of
tacoma
is
not
being
run
by
the
indians.
it
can
be
run
by
the
state
of
washington
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
1963
act
implementing
public
law
280.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
it
is
too
broad.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr
iii
inaccurate
in
that
sense,
that
is
correct.
we
see
no
other
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction
for
the
state
to
exercise
over
on-reservation
activities.
we
believe
that
the
treaty
of
1854,
the
treaty
of
madison
creek,
quite
clearly
gives
the
indians
exclusive
rights
to
fish
within
their
indian
reservation,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
ever
been
challenged
before
by
the
state.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
state's
challenges
to
it
now
are
based
on
any
solid
authority.
we
think
that
the
fishing
rights
are
of
naturally
great
importance
to
the
indians.
they
are
now,
as
they
were
then.
we
do
not
believe
that
they
can
be
limited
by
the
state,
simply
because
the
state
want
additional
fish
for
its
sports
fishermen.
we
ask
the
court
to
so
rule.
thank
you
very
much.
