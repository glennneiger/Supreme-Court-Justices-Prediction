justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rodgers,
would
this
court
be
bound
by
that
res
judicata
holding?
i
mean,
on
the
question
of
the
reservation,
are
we
bound,
even
if
you
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
farr,
is
it
correct,
though,
that
the
issue
of
the
status
of
the
reservation
was
raised
in
earlier
stages
of
this
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
has
never
been
decided
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nor
by
any
other
court
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
it
is
not
an
open
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
had
one
question,
mr.
wilner.
after
a
hatchery
fish
is
caught
by
a
sports
fisherman,
he
treats
it
just
like
any
other
fish?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
no
regulation
in
terms
of
whether
it
is
hatchery
or
not
when
you
are
talking
about
your
own
people,
the
non-indians.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
meant
--
is
there
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
a
hatchery
fish
can
be
identified
after
it
is
caught.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
by
excluding
them
from
the
treaty,
you
are
really
excluding
a
percentage
of
the
total
run
rather
than
a
specific
number.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
purposes
once
they
are
in
the
river,
they
are
treated
as
fungible
fish;
i
mean,
they
are
all
alike
after
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
give
you
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
attorne
generla
gorton,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
hatchery
fish
that
justice
marshallâ€™s
question
prompts?
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
quite
independent
theories
which
might
justify
excluding
the
hatchery
fish.
one
is
that
they
were
not
there
at
the
time
of
the
treaty,
and
then
the
independent
reason
is
that
they
were
paid
for
by
the
license
fees.
would
you
contend
that
if
the
license-fee
money
had
been
used
to
improve
water
quality
in
some
way
which
enlarged
the
run,
that
a
portion
of
the
fish
would
not
be
covered
by
the
treaty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
enlarged
the
natural
run.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
not
the
question
of
where
the
funds
come
from;
it
is
a
question
it
is
fish
that
are
artificially
added,
and
it
does
not
really
matter
how
they
paid
for,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
they
are
simply
general-revenue
funds
that
were
used
to
subsidize
a
new
development
of
a
breed
of
fish
or
something
like
that?
you
would
still
say
they
were
excluded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
point
i
am
trying
to
identify
is,
it
is
not
critical
to
your
argument
that
there
are
license
fees
being
used.
the
critical
point
is,
it
is
a
brand-new
batch
of
fish.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rodgers,
at
what
point
in
the
litigation
did
you
first
assert
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
which
i
have
to
announce
is
an
old
friend.
it
is
before
the
court
for
the
third
time
after
more
than
15
years
of
litigation.
it
concerns
the
rights
of
the
puyallup
indians
of
the
state
of
washington
to
fish
with
nets
for
steelhead
trout
in
the
puyallup
river
and
the
degree
to
which
those
rights
are
subservient
to
conservation
regulation
by
the
washington
department
of
game.
the
fish
involved
are
steelhead
trout
and
anadromous
fish
which
spawn
upstream
from
the
original
reservation
traveled
down
the
puyallup
river
into
the
ocean
and
then
return
as
adults.
in
prior
cases,
we
held
that
the
department
of
game
could
regulate
this
fishing
in
the
interest
of
conservation.
we
also
held,
however,
that
the
state
could
not
totally
prohibit
the
indians
from
operating
a
commercial
net
fishery.
today,
we
review
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
affirming
with
a
slight
modification,
a
trial
court
order
which
directs
the
tribe
to
file
a
list
of
members
authorized
to
exercise
treaty
fishing
rights
and
to
report
to
the
washington
state
department
of
game
and
to
the
court
the
number
of
steelhead
caught
by
its
treaty
fisherman
each
week.
we
hold
that
at
least
under
the
particular
circumstances
and
facts
of
this
case,
the
indian
fishermen
are
subject
to
regulation
by
the
department
of
game
while
they
fish
on
their
reservation.
it
should
be
noted
that
of
the
18,000
acres
in
the
original
reservation,
all
the
22
acres
have
been
disposed
of
by
the
puyallup
indians
and
that
none
of
the
remaining
22
acres
abuts
on
the
puyallup
river.
we
also
hold,
however,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
order
of
the
washington
court
is
directed
at
the
tribe
as
oppose
to
individual
members
of
the
tribe,
it
is
invalid
as
infringing
on
the
tribe's
sovereign
immunity.
in
all
other
respects,
we
sustained
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
mr.
justice
blackmun
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
