unknown
speaker
i
would
think
if
res
judicata
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
it
would
be
the
holding
of
the
washington
supreme
court
that
the
reservation
had
been
terminated
that
would
be
res
judicata
in
this
case.
it
is
involving
the
same
parties
and
the
same
litigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
going
to
tell
us
after
lunch
where
and
how
the
washington
supreme
court
has
now
accepted
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
proposition
that
the
reservation
have
been
terminated.
unknown
speaker
unless
the
reservation
has
been
terminated.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rodgers,
can
i
ask
you
the
(inaudible)
point
of
it,
res
judicata
argument.
would
there
be
any
other
reason
or
would
there
be
any
barrier
to
the
state’s
raising
the
issue
of
the
existence
of
the
reservation
in
this
case
on
this?
unknown
speaker
it
would
support
their
judgment.
it
would
support
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
somewhere
there
were
20
full-time,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
puyallup
iii
is
just
another
stage
of
the
same
litigation.
unknown
speaker
before
you
proceed,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
presented
by
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case
is
a
question
that
exists
quite
apart
from
the
existence
of
any
treaty
or
the
meaning
of
any
treaty.
it
simply
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
state
of
washington,
or
any
state,
may
adjudicate
on-reservation
fishing
rights
of
an
indian
tribe.
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
go
through
the
reservation
--
unknown
speaker
--
unimpeded.
unknown
speaker
aren’t
they
also
an
issue
before
judge
bolt?
unknown
speaker
we
are
very
much
aware
of
that.
unknown
speaker
you
started
to
say
whom
you
are
representing.
