justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
had
thought
your
question
presented
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
that
the
state
court
simply
lack
jurisdiction
to
hail
the
tribal
court
before
it.
i
get
the
impression
from
hearing
your
last
proposition
that
you
are
talking
more
about
the
merits,
am
i
wrong?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
would
that
extend
to
individual
indians,
as
well
as
the
tribe,
if
it
depends
on
article
ii
of
the
treaty,
that
pre-emption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
making
any
claim
of
re-
--
you
did
not
present
any
question
of
res
judicata
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
did
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
explain
that?
look
at
your
question
presented
on
page
2
of
your
petition,
where
you
say
"whether
consistently
with
the
established
(inaudible)
of
tribal
immunity,
a
state
court
may
adjudicate
on-reservation
treaty
fishing
rights
of
an
indian
tribe
and
allocate
the
catch
among
tribal
and
non-tribal
fishermen".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
that,
that
it
ought
to
be
fairly
read
as
embracing
issues
that
ought
to
be
dispositive?
dispositive
of
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
right.
it
is
your
cohort
or
colleague
going
to
argue
the
res
judicata
point,
or
are
you
prepared
to
deal
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
res
judicata
in
this
case
would
just
be
a
matter
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
washington,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
care
to
articulate
that
all,
because
you
certainly
do
not
spell
it
out
in
your
brief
at
all.
you
are
not
relying
on
28
17
38,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
have
thought
if
congress
intended
to
have
that
provision,
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
would
have
addressed
it
directly,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rogers,
if
you
are
right
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court,
i
take
it
it
was
without
jurisdiction
when
the
action
was
originally
filed
in
’63?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
it
lose
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
tribe
just
brought
in
after
the
remand
from
this
court
in
puyallup
ii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
the
rule
necessarily
be
the
same
in
a
case
coming
here
from
the
state
court
as
in
a
case
coming
from
the
federal
court
as
to
whether
something
must
be
in
the
record?
might
not
washington
procedure
have
a
different
rule
than
federal
procedure
in
that
respect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
your
position
for
that
the
direct
authority
of
the
same
case
book
that
your
colleague
referred
to
this
morning?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
res
judicata,
unless
you
are
talking
about
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
or
about
28
u.s.c
1738,
res
judicata
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
it
is
up
to
the
state
of
washington
to
decide
how
much
credence
or
faith
it
wants
to
give
to
the
decisions
of
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says
once
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
says
nothing
about
federal
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
something
we
would
not
review
here
if
the
supreme
court
of
washington
decided
it
one
way
or
the
other.
it
is
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
united
states
brought
the
action
before
judge
bolt.
the
united
states
was
not
a
party
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
your
opponents
would
contend
that
the
state
court
is
not
free
to
interpret
the
treaty;
even
though
you
may
be
absolutely
right
as
to
your
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
that
the
state
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
decide
one
way
or
the
other
whether
it
is
hatchery
fish
or
excluded.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
have
been
some
inconsistencies
on
both
sides
ever
since
1963.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
have
not
been
here
long
enough
yet.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gorton,
do
you
understand
your
opponent’s
sovereign-immunity
contention
to
be
that
you
simply
cannot
bring
the
tribe
into
court,
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
washington,
for
whatever
purpose
or
more
like
an
nlrb
pre-emption
type
of
thing,
where
because
federal
law
such
as
the
treaty
of
madison
creek
is
involved,
a
state
court
cannot
pass
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
counsel
may
concede
that
the
united
states
could
bring
a
suit
against
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
me
and
my
colleagues,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rodgers,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
i
take
it
if
you
are
right
and
this
sovereign
immunity
should
have
been
recognized
far
earlier
than
now
that
both
of
our
decisions
in
puyallup
i
and
puyallup
ii
are
wiped
out,
because
if
the
supreme
court
of
washington
had
no
jurisdiction,
we
surely
had
no
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
the
same,
same
litigation.
how
and
where
do
the
facts
