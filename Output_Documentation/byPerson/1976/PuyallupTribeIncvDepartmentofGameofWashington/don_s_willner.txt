mr.
don
s.
willner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
argument,
i
will
take
20
minutes;
attorney
general
gorton
of
the
state
of
washington
will
take
25
minutes.
we
have
attempted
to
make
an
allocation
among
us
by
subject
matter
to
the
extent
we
can.
i
am
going
to
be
talking
about
conservation,
about
the
exclusion
of
hatchery
fish,
about
the
res
judicata
concerns;
mr.
gorton
will
be
talking
about
sovereign
immunity,
the
reservation,
which
has
been
considered
in
many
of
the
questions
here,
and
also
the
problem
of
allocation.
both
of
us
will
be
essentially
saying
to
the
court
that
what
the
supreme
court
of
washington
did
was
very
faithfully
carry
out
the
mandate
of
this
court;
that
this
court
in
puyallup
ii
sent
this
case
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and,
through
them,
to
the
trial
court
to
do
three
things:
first
of
all,
to
determine
whether
hatchery
fish,
which
are
paid
for
by
sports
fishermen,
are
excluded
from
the
treaty
and
from
a
treaty
fishery;
secondly,
to
determine
a
plan
for
implementation
and
a
plan
for
regulation;
and
third
of
all,
to
determine
a
fair
allocation
of
the
fish
between
the
sports
fishermen
and
the
treaty
indians,
which
in
your
words
in
puyallup
ii
accommodated
the
rights
of
the
indians
with
the
rights
of
the
other
people.
and
it
is
our
position
that
is
exactly
what
the
supreme
court
of
washington
did
through
an
extensive
trial,
through
the
decision
of
that
court,
and
we
are
here
seeking
affirmance.
now,
i
should
briefly
state
who
i
represent
before
i
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
if
you
look
at
that
question,
that
everything
that
we
want
to
discuss
with
this
court
flows
from
that
single
sentence.
that
sentence
talks
about
tribal
immunity.
we
were
supposed
to
talk
about
that,
and
that
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
the
state
was
regulating
the
rights
of
individuals.
it
talks
about
on-reservation
treaty
fishing
rights,
and
of
course
it
is
our
contention
that
if
the
hatchery
fish
were
excluded
from
the
treaty,
that
they
are
entitled
to
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
even
if
there
is
a
reservation
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
--
they
are
entitled
to
get
through
unimpeded,
just
like
if
they
were
domestic
cattle
straying
on
the
land
of
the
puyallups.
it
talks
about
indian
tribe,
and
that
again
talks
about
who
this
action
is
against.
it
talks
about
allocation;
that
again
deals
with
matters
we
want
to
talk
about.
so
essentially
what
i
am
saying
in
response
to
your
honorâ€™s
question
is,
in
our
effort
to
defend
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
everything
we
want
to
talk
about
is
raised
in
this
single
sentence
and
also,
may
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court,
that
we
would
very
much
like
to
get
these
matters
decided;
that
these
are
the
issues
that
the
supreme
court
decided,
these
are
the
issues
that
have
been
the
subject
of
an
incredible
amount
of
litigation
in
the
state
of
washington.
they
are
fairly
here
to
hear
on
the
record,
they
are
raised
in
the
questions
presented
and
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
your
honor,
they
are
at
issue
before
judge
bolt
in
what
i
would
respectfully
suggest
a
very
strange
way.
this
case
started
in
1963.
it
has
been
up
here
twice.
these
questions
have
been
in
this
case
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
yes,
sir.
thereafter,
judge
bolt
in
a
case
in
which
my
clients
are
not
parties
--
it
is
then
that
we
sought
intervention
that
we
are
denied
--
after
the
remand
of
this
case
in
puyallup
ii,
judge
bolt
had
gone
into
some,
but
not
to
all
of
these
questions.
when
i
say
"some,
but
not
all",
judge
bolt
in
that
decision
in
february
1974
said
that
he
would
initially
defer
to
the
state
court
on
this
question
of
this
exclusion
of
hatchery
fish
because
of
the
mandate
of
this
court.
and
then
after
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
our
favor,
federal
judge
bolt
in
a
case
in
which
we
were
not
a
party
issued
an
injunction
against
the
state
of
washington,
enjoining
them
during
the
pendency
of
his
case
from
distinguishing
hatchery
fish
and
said
that
he
would
not
give
res
judicata
effect
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
on
the
very
issue
before
some
summon
of
the
same
parties.
mr.
don
s.
willner
no,
your
honor.
the
united
states
defended
the
puyallup
tribe
throughout
the
later
part
of
this
litigation.
if
we
get
to
technical
res
judicata
areas,
we
contend
had
the
laboring
or;
but,
no,
they
were
not
parties.
the
united
states
represented
the
puyallup
tribe
in
this
case
in
the
trial
court
through
the
united
states
attorney;
but,
no,
they
were
not
parties.
i
think,
your
honor,
just
a
couple
of
things
i
do
want
to
say
preliminarily.
mr.
don
s.
willner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
don
s.
willner
yes,
forgive
me.
i
am
here,
your
honors,
for
the
sports
fishermen
of
washington.
i
represent
the
largest
sport-fishing
group
in
the
state.
there
are
150,000
sports
fishermen
in
the
state
of
washington.
their
interest
in
this
case
is
primarily
on
the
areas
i
am
going
to
discuss,
which
are
conservation
of
the
fishing
resource
and
the
exclusion
of
the
hatchery
fish
from
the
treaty
fishery.
now,
i
think
the
court
are
a
along
way
from
the
rivers
of
the
state
of
washington
and
from
the
anadromous
fishery.
i
think
the
court
understands
from
the
previous
cases
that
basically
steelhead
are
anadromous
fish;
that
many
of
them
are
propagated
in
hatcheries,
artificially
propagated
in
hatcheries,
something
that
was
unknown
at
the
time
of
the
treaty
of
1855;
that
on
this
river
--
and
this
is
something
that
has
been
developed
in
this
record,
which
was
sent
us
back
to
determine
--
on
this
river,
on
the
puyallup
river,
almost
the
entire
cost
of
the
hatchery
operation
is
paid
for
out
of
dedicated
funds
of
the
department
of
game,
earmarked
or
dedicated
funds;
and
the
finding
is
virtually
entirely
all
of
those
funds
for
the
steelhead
operation
came
from
the
sports
fishermen.
the
sports
fishermen
not
only
paid
for
these
hatchery
fish
with
their
license
fees
and
tags,
the
records
also
shows
that
we
have
gone
out
and
done
voluntary
work,
we
have
planted
fish,
we
have
enhanced
the
run,
we
have
worked
on
the
habitat,
we
have
done
many
things.
it
is
our
basic
intention,
the
reason
why
my
clients
have
sent
me
on
the
plane
to
come
back
to
washington,
d.c.,
is
to
essentially
respectfully
say
to
this
court
that
we
really
have
an
equitable
interest
in
these
hatchery
fish
along
the
lines
of
the
concurring
opinion
by
this
court
in
this
case
in
puyallup
ii,
which
has
now
been
amply
demonstrated
by
the
record
that
has
been
made
through
a
ten-day
trial.
and
this
was
one
of
the
bases
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington's
decision.
it
had
several
bases.
it
said,
first
of
all,
that
the
hatchery
fish
equitably
belong
to
those
who
paid
for
them
with
earmarked
funds.
secondly,
it
interpreted
the
treaty,
and
it
said
that
in
1855
that
no
one
could
have
contemplated
a
hatchery-fish
operation,
they
could
not
have
been
intended.
and
then
it
looked
at
a
particular
part
of
that
treaty,
where
the
treaty
talks
about
the
exclusion
from
the
treaty
fishery
of
shellfish
that
are
staked
or
cultivated
by
citizens.
and
the
supreme
court
of
washington
said,
"this
is
a
very
good
indication
that
if
anybody
had
known
about
hatchery
fish,
they
would
have
excluded
them,
because
they
excluded
another
form
of
marine
life
in
which
there
was
the
effort
and
industry
of
citizens
put
into
developing
the
resource".
so
the
first
point
that
i
really
want
to
make
to
this
court
is
that
the
concurring
opinion
of
this
court
in
puyallup
ii,
which
remembers
the
court
put
in
your
opinion
and
in
the
other
the
majority
did
not
disagree
with.
the
majority
said,
"this
may
be
the
issue
that
will
be
a
basis
for
the
remand".
so
we
went
back
and
we
tried
that
issue.
we
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trial
court,
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
that
hatchery
fish
are
identifiable.
we
proved
also
--
and
this
is
something
that
my
colleague
tells
me
was
not
made
as
clear
as
it
could
be
in
the
brief,
and
that
is
the
only
fish
that
we
claim
are
hatchery
fish
are
the
first
generation,
those
that
are
propagated
in
the
hatchery,
because
they
can
be
identified
by
dorsal-fin
damage;
that
all
the
progeny
of
the
hatchery
fish
are
counted
as
natural
run,
and
we
are
happy
to
have
them
counted
as
natural
run.
so
no
matter
what
you
do,
there
is
a
subsidy
that
the
sports
fishermen
are
doing
to
help
the
treaty
indian
fishery.
but
in
terms
of
the
first-generation
hatchery
fish,
which
are
put
in
that
river
due
to
our
money
and
our
industry
and
our
effort,
that
our
first
point
respectfully
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
should
be
affirmed
when
it
says
that
those
fish
are
excluded
from
the
treaty
fishery;
and
if
they
are
excluded
from
the
treaty
fishery,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reservation,
we
should
not
be
prevented
from
having
them.
and
i
gave
the
example
earlier,
and
i
will
say
it
again.
it
is
as
if
they
were
domestic
cattle
wandering
onto
a
reservation.
they
are
entitled
to
get
through
the
reservation
to
the
sports
fishermen
who
paid
for
them.
mr.
don
s.
willner
they
are
typically
put
into
the
stream,
your
honor,
after
one
year
of
life.
mr.
don
s.
willner
they
are
put
in
as
smolt.
mr.
don
s.
willner
very
slight
period
of
time.
the
findings
show
that
almost
instantly,
they
go
downstream.
mr.
don
s.
willner
yes,
and
this
is
very
important,
because
they
do
not
compete
for
food
supply
with
natural
run.
they
are
out
of
there.
mr.
don
s.
willner
they
are
ready
to
take
off.
mr.
don
s.
willner
three
or
four
years.
mr.
don
s.
willner
two
or
three
years.
mr.
don
s.
willner
no,
i
would
say
a
steelhead
life
is
four
or
five
years.
a
hatchery
fish
is
put
in
as
a
smolt
after
one
year.
a
natural
fish
is
ready
to
go
sea
after
two
years.
the
hatchery
fish
are
better-fed.
they
are
out
in
the
ocean
two
or
three
years,
then
they
come
back.
mr.
don
s.
willner
no.
mr.
don
s.
willner
the
hatchery
fish
come
back
to
the
place
where
they
were
planted,
interestingly
enough.
their
instinct
is
the
first
place
they
get
put
into
that
river,
that
is
where
they
come
back
to.
mr.
don
s.
willner
in
this
particular
situation,
your
honor,
no.
the
hatchery
was
on
chambers
creek,
which
was
not
even
on
the
puyallup
river.
they
were
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
they
are
planted
upstream
on
the
puyallup.
mr.
don
s.
willner
oh,
yes.
mr.
don
s.
willner
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
are
in
the
reservation
maybe
--
nobody
knows
exactly
--
a
week
or
ten
days
going
to
the
ocean.
they
are
in
the
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
no,
not
going
down.
mr.
don
s.
willner
and
on
the
way
back
they
are
in
the
reservation,
if
there
is
a
reservation,
a
very
short
period
of
time.
mr.
don
s.
willner
on
the
way
upstream.
mr.
don
s.
willner
if
there
is
a
reservation,
yes.
mr.
don
s.
willner
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
don
s.
willner
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
basic
answer
to
that
question
is
the
reason
why
the
state
supreme
court
has
jurisdiction
is,
this
court
told
it
to
answer
those
questions.
mr.
don
s.
willner
yes.
in
puyallup
ii,
you
said,
"answer
these
questions".
the
state
supreme
court
did,
and
we
won;
and
basically
what
they
want
is,
they
want
to
try
it
again
somewhere
else.
mr.
don
s.
willner
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
reason
why
we
think
it
is
presented
is
because
if
we
are
defining
their
treaty
fishing
right,
we
say
that
their
treaty
fishing
right
excludes
the
hatchery
fish,
and
they
have
asked
this
court
to
define
their
treaty
fishing
right.
even
if
you
are
defining
their
on-reservation
treaty
fishing
right
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
well,
they
are
asking
this
court
to
say
the
state
has
no
power
because
of
on-reservation
fishery.
mr.
don
s.
willner
now,
incidentally,
not
all
of
these
fish
are
on-reservation,
caught
on
reservation
by
the
tribe;
but
most
of
them.
but
going
on
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
right.
we
agree.
but
essentially
what
i
am
saying
is
if
they
say
that
these
--
that
what
we
are
only
concerned
here
with
is
what
they
can
do
on
the
reservation.
we
say
that
within
that
question
is
the
question
whether
we
are
entitled
to
these
hatchery
fish,
which
should
be
allowed
to
go
through
the
reservation,
and
that
they
are
not
included
in
their
fishery
even
if
it
is
a
reservation,
because
we
pay
for
them,
and
we
think
that
is
fairly
before
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
your
honor,
one
of
my
clients
claims
that
he
can
tell
the
appearance
of
a
natural
fish
and
a
hatchery
fishery
by
they
fight
on
the
line.
most
of
them
will
not
go
that
far.
but
what
is
in
this
record
is
that
the
hatchery
fish
can
be
identified
after
they
are
caught,
and
they
can
be
allocated
by
numbers,
because
after
all
what
the
treaty
indians
are
concerned
with,
it
is
a
commercial
fishery,
what
they
are
concerned
within,
and
you
can
make
a
fair
allocation
by
numbers.
mr.
don
s.
willner
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
just
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
don
s.
willner
he
certainly
does,
your
honor.
mr.
don
s.
willner
you
say
"regulation",
your
honor.
mr.
don
s.
willner
the
significance,
which
we
think
is
what
most
of
the
trial
is
about,
was,
it
is
a
way
of
making
a
fair
allocation;
that
if
it
can
be
determined,
as
the
trial
court
did
after
ten
days
of
trial,
that
the
hatchery
fish
are
identifiable,
you
can
therefore
determine
the
percentage
of
the
hatchery
run
to
the
percentage
of
the
natural
run.
you
can
therefore
make
an
allocation
which
is
in
accordance
with
the
treaty.
you
can
exclude
the
hatchery
fish
from
the
treaty
and
still
give
the
treaty
indians
a
fair
share
of
the
natural
run.
mr.
don
s.
willner
yes,
we
are,
certainly.
but
we
are
excluding
a
percentage
of
the
total
run
that
is
the
percentage
that
we
paid
for
by
paying
virtually
the
entire
cost
of
the
hatchery
program
into
the
game
fund,
and
then
that
paid
the
hatcheries.
mr.
don
s.
willner
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
things
i
do
want
to
say
to
the
court
on
my
time.
first
of
all,
on
this
question
of
just
a
few
things
that
counsel
said.
though
attorney
general
gorton
will
be
talking
more
about
the
question
of
the
contentions
of
the
puyallup
tribe,
counsel
for
the
puyallup
tribe
said
here
today
in
this
courtroom
this
morning
that
the
tribe
concedes
that
for
some
purposes,
the
federal
courts
may
regulate
the
reservation
fishery,
as
if
to
say
to
this
court
that
the
state
does
not
have
to,
we
concede
the
federal
courts
can
do
it.
but
unfortunately
for
its
position,
in
a
pending
case
before
the
ninth
circuit,
in
a
brief
written
nine
months
ago
which
has
not
yet
been
argued,
the
puyallup
tribe
through
the
same
counsel
that
is
just
addressed
you
has
written
a
brief
in
which
they
take
the
disposition
that
the
federal
courts
cannot
regulate
what
they
call
a
reservation
fishery.

of
counsel's
brief
in
this
case
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
don
s.
willner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
don
s.
willner
no,
your
honor,
i
am
arguing
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
its
position
here,
which
i
feel
should
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
court.
mr.
don
s.
willner
well,
your
honor,
none
on
ours
yet;
but
we
have
not
been
there
since
1963.
mr.
don
s.
willner
certainly,
i
agree.
mr.
don
s.
willner
well,
it
is
our
hope
that
this
court
in
this
case
will
kind
of
give
us
an
answer
that
is
going
to
make
sense
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
want
to
talk
briefly
about
a
couple
of
things
again
on
the
facts.
there
is
some
implication
--
again
in
the
brief
of
counsel
for
the
puyallup
tribe,
there
is
some
implication
that
there
is
a
heavy
commercial
fishery
on
these
steelhead
before
they
get
to
the
puyallup
river.
counsel
says,
for
example,
on
page
10
of
the
brief,
his
brief,
"steelhead
also
are
caught
in
washington
waters
incidental
to
the
commercial
catch
of
salmon".
well,
the
citation
he
gives
for
that
statement
deals
with
the
columbia
river,
not
with
puget
sound,
not
with
the
puyallup
river
which
goes
into
puget
sound.
it
deals
with
a
totally
different
water
system.
columbia
river
is
between
oregon
and
washington,
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
puget
sound.
in
puget
sound,
the
fact
is
that
it
is
illegal
under
washington
law
for
a
commercial
fisherman
to
land
a
steelhead.
counsel
goes
on
to
say
in
his
brief
on
pages
9
and
10,
"steelhead
destined
for
south
puget
sound
waters
of
the
puyallup
river
are
nonetheless
subject
to
a
heavy
commercial
fishery,
principally
foreign
fishing
on
the
high
seas".
he
gives
several
record
citations,
and
none
supports
it.
my
time
is
up.
