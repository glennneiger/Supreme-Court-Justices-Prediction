was
there
a
controlling
shareholder
of
christiana?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
theory
was
that
if
there
were
then
that
single
controlling
shareholder
of
christiana
would
become
the
controlling
shareholder
of
du
pont.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
and
yet,
that
might
be
expected,
at
least
in
some
circumstances,
to
command
a
premium,
in
answer
to
my
brother
white’s
--
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
value
accorded
at
all
to
the
--
no
control
premium
accorded
at
all
on
this
count.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
tax
on
inter-corporate
dividends
of
what,
7.2%?
unknown
speaker
and
a
potential
capital
gain
on
the
tax
--
unknown
speaker
on
the,
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
just
a
threat
hanging
there,
it
is
not
a
tax
that
is
imposed
but
--
unknown
speaker
until
there
is
recognition
of
the
gain.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
unknown
speaker
your
argument
has
focused
on
the
controller
relationship
between
christiana
and
du
pont.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
have
a
merger
situation
involving
no
control
element.
unknown
speaker
let
me
add
one
other
factor.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
a
du
pont
stockholder,
you
would
be
interested
in
the
fairness
of
the
merger,
as
long
as
that
came
about,
wouldn’t
you,
whether
that
resulted
from
control
or
bad
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
one
of
your
theories
at
least
is
that
it
was
an
error
for
the
sec
to
look
solely
at
the
net
asset
value.
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying,
without
regard
to
the
investment
company
situation
or
the
controller
situation,
just
an
ordinary
merger,
would
you
as
a
stockholder
object
if
your
company
accepted
or
entered
into
a
merger
on
the
basis
of
an
exchange
determined
solely
by
the
net
asset
value
of
the
other
company’s
shares?
unknown
speaker
ibm,
for
example,
everything
the
same
except
you
do
not
have
the
controller
relationship.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not.
unknown
speaker
you
would
think
it
a
fair
merger
under
those
circumstances?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
now
saying
it
would
be
unfair
even
if
there
were
no
holding
company
situation.
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
one
asking
that
question,
but
the
question
the
court
would
have
to
answer
if
a
stockholder
brought
a
suit
challenging
the
fairness
of
the
merger
is
whether
or
not
the
terms
were
fair,
not
whether
a
stockholder
should
ask
why
should
i
do
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
murtaugh,
this
transaction
has
not
been
submitted
to
the
shareholders
of
either
company,
that
will
follow
after
the
sec
job.
unknown
speaker
so
we
do
not
know
what
views
the
minority
shareholders
might
have.
