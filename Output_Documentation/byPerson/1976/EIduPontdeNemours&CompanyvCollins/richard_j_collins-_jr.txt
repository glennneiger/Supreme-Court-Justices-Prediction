mr.
richard
j.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
first
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
commission
should
have
given
significant
notice
to
both
the
market
value
and
the
net
asset
value
of
christiana.
repeatedly,
in
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
by
my
opponents,
the
question
is
presented
as
though
the
commission
should
have
made
a
choice
between
either
the
net
asset
value
or
the
market
value.
i
believe
that
the
question
is
a
choice
of
using
both
of
them
and
arriving
at
a
verdict.
i
go
back
to
my
letter
of
october
27th,
i
believe,
1972,
which
appears
at
the
end
of
the
appendix.
i
wrote
to
the
commission
in
answer
to
their
request
for
any
objections
to
the
transaction
and
i
said,
that
in
my
opinion,
after
considering
the
fact
that
christiana
had
consistently
sold
at
a
20-25%
discount,
that
i
believed
the
terms
should
be
done
on
a
10%
basis.
that
to
me
is
saying
that
both
the
net
asset
value
and
the
market
value
have
a
material
meaning.
now,
this
case
involves
both
economics
and
law,
and
i
believe
that
we
should
have
an
understanding
of
the
different
types
of
economic
systems
that
the
country
can
operate
under.
you
have
first
a
capitalist
system
which
is
laissez-faire
and
money
counts
exclusively
and
the
man
with
the
most
money
has
power
and
the
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
are
in
private
hands.
another
system
completely
opposed
to
that
would
be
a
socialist
system,
where
all
of
the
means
of
production
are
owned
by
the
state.
in
either
of
these
two
systems,
i
submit
that
this
case
would
not
have
arisen.
but
there
is
a
third
system
which
i
believe
prevails
today
in
this
country,
and
that
is
a
middle-of-the
road
system,
whereby
there
is
government
intervention
to
balance
the
powers
that
are
controlled
by
private
people,
and
that
generally
speaking,
the
government
intervention
that
has
taken
place
in
this
country
has
been
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
weak
as
opposed
to
the
strong.
you
have
the
anti-trust
laws.
you
have
the
public
utility
holding
company
laws
that
are
generally,
i
believe,
written
with
the
philosophy
of
putting
restraints
on
individual
powers.
now,
getting
down
to
this
specific
act
of
1940,
one
provision
of
the
investment
company
act
says
that
the
ownership
of
25%
or
more
of
the
voting
stock
is
presumed
to
be
controlled,
unless
the
commission
finds
to
the
contrary.
now,
i
submit
that
forgetting
about
the
act,
that
where
you
have
28%
owned
by
one
corporation
and
the
other
72%
of
the
voting
stocks
scattered
among
225,000
stockholders,
that
act
or
no
act
that
it
would
be
presumed
that
the
man
with
28%
of
the
votes
controls.
now,
the
second
part
of
the
act
says
that
if
there
is
a
transaction
between
the
man
in
control
and
his
controlled
corporation,
there
should
be
no
overreaching.
another
part
of
the
act
says
that
the
commissionâ€™s
findings
of
fact
shall
be
conclusive
if
supported
by
the
evidence.
there
is
a
general
law
i
believe
that
says
that
the
administrative
agency,
the
commission,
should
be
upheld
unless
it
has
an
erroneous
view
of
the
law
or
unless
its
findings
are
based
on
factual
findings,
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
and
i
believe
that
it
is
my
burden
to
show
either
that
the
commission
has
an
erroneous
view
of
the
law
or
else
that
its
findings
of
fact
are
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
now,
i
believe
--
first,
we
should
now
have
a
picture
of
christiana.
christiana
is
a
controlled
device,
it
is
a
controlled
device.
when
you
are
talking
about
the
positions
of
du
pont
and
christiana,
to
say
that
du
pont
is
in
the
strategic
position,
i
believe
is
somewhat
out
of
order.
i
would
say
that
the
person
on
top,
the
person
in
control,
as
between
the
two
parties,
the
person
on
top
is
in
the
strategic
position,
if
anyone
is
in
a
strategic
position.
now,
there
is
a
factual
finding
by
the
commission
at
page
a-49
of
the
appendix.
the
commission
says
that
christiana
stock
and
du
pont
stock
are
economically
equivalent.
i
challenge
that
finding.
i
say
that
the
commission
has
made
a
mistake,
because
it
has
not
realized
the
meaning
of
a
holding
company,
and
for
simplification
purposes,
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
this.
that
if
you
have
an
operating
company
with
say
100
shares
of
stock
outstanding,
scattered
among
20
people,
that
each
share
of
stock
is
a
share
of
stock
with
an
equal
value.
now,
the
minute
that
the
owners
of
28%
of
those
shares
get
together
and
exchange
their
shares
of
operating
stock
and
put
it
into
a
holding
company
and
issue
holding
company
stock
against
it,
they
have
owned
something
different.
they
have
created
a
different
animal.
let
us
say
that
one
man
with
15
shares
and
another
man
with
13
shares
get
together
and
they
say
we
are
going
to
have
a
holding
company.
the
man
with
the
15
shares
out
of
the
28
in
the
holding
company
immediately
has
control
of
28
shares.
he
has
a
different
stock.
he
has
something
that
is
not
economically
equivalent
to
what
he
had
the
day
before;
his
15
shares
of
the
operating
company.
now,
that
is
the
inherent
nature
of
a
holding
company.
the
sole
purpose
of
the
holding
company,
people
talk
about
it
as
dominating
the
operating
company,
but
first
and
foremost,
the
sole
purpose
of
that
holding
company
is
to
dominate
the
other
stockholders.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
i
was
saying
your
honor
that
the
ownership
of
stock
of
the
--
that
the
stock
itself
of
the
holding
company
is
different
than
the
stock
of
the
operating
company.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
now,
i
use
the
analogy
of
15
and
13.
if
you
broke
it
down
that
there
were
28
shareholders
of
the
holding
company,
i
say
that
15
of
those
28
have
control.
i
am
saying
that
one
share
of
christiana
is
inherently
different
than
one
share
of
du
pont.
it
has
the
potential
voting
power
that
is
greater
than
the
operating
company.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
richard
j.
collins
no,
but
the
commission
made
the
mistake
in
saying
that
they
are
the
same,
that
they
are
economically
the
same.
and
you
get
this
strange
situation,
strange
on
the
surface,
that
the
stock
of
christiana,
the
control
stock,
is
selling
at
a
discount.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
selling
at
a
discount
made
up
of
two
factors.
it
is
made
up
that
ordinarily,
without
any
taxes,
if
you
eliminate
the
tax
situation,
that
christiana
stock
would
be
worth
more
than
du
pont
stock
on
a
share
per
share
basis.
but
along
comes
congress,
not
the
minority
stockholders
of
du
pont,
but
along
comes
congress
and
says
here
are
certain
tax
laws,
and
those
tax
laws
knock
down
the
price
of
the
holding
company.
they
do
not
do
anything
for
the
stock
of
the
operating
company,
all
they
do
is
knock
down
the
price
of
the
holding
company.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
7.5%.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
and
an
unknown
tremendous
capital
gain.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
on
the
liquidation
--
mr.
richard
j.
collins
it
is
not
a
tax
that
is
imposed
--
mr.
richard
j.
collins
but
it
exists,
it
exists.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
i
would
say
your
honor
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
collins
then
your
honor
i
would
say
that
my
case
does
not
apply,
because
my
case,
your
honor,
is
predicated
on
the
fact
that
there
was
control,
and
that
by
using
the
control,
they
got
a
better
price
than
they
could
have
had
without
the
control.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
i
believe
that
you
cannot
judge
the
end
without
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
collins
yes,
and
you
are
--
mr.
richard
j.
collins
with
christiana
owning
some
ibm
shares?
mr.
richard
j.
collins
no,
i
probably
would
not.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
i
would
not.
mr.
richard
j.
collins
i
would
say
this
that
what
is
the
advantage
to
me
in
voting
for
the
merger
if
i
am
paying
net
asset
value?
mr.
richard
j.
collins
no,
i
cannot
say
that
it
would
be
unfair,
but
i
would
ask
the
question,
why
should
i
do
it?
mr.
richard
j.
collins
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
your
honor.
