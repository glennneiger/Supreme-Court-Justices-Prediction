mr.
ferber,
i
suppose
it
is
not
relevant,
but
how
long
has
christiana
been
in
existence?
was
it
formed
in
the
personal
holding
company
act
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
take
that
there
is
no
challenge
or
question
about
the
qualifications
of
tax-free
transaction
with
the
internal
revenue
code?
justice
john
paul
stevens
christiana’s
stock
was
not
really
involved
in
this
merger,
was
it,
except
insofar
as
determining
what
amount
of
du
pont
stock
after
the
merger
the
various
christiana’s
stockholders
would
receive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
owners
of
the
stock
will
receive
in
terms
of
du
pont
shares
after
the
merger.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gribbon,
would
you
tell
me
where
the
commission
said
--
that
i
was
under
the
impression
they
said
there
was
a
range
that
was
okay,
and
that
this
fell
within
the
range.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
carry
that
argument
to
the
point
at
which
if
there
had
been
overreaching
in
the
sense
that
christiana
had
a
benefit
that
was
so
large
there
was
some
detriment
to
du
pont,
that
the
commission
could
not
have
disapproved
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
impact
was
not
on
the
investment
company
shareholders?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
attach
any
independent
significance
to
the
word
overreaching
as
opposed
to
the
words
fair
and
reasonable?
in
other
words,
i
take
it
your
opponents
argue
that,
that
requires
something
in
equivalent
to
arm’s
length
bargaining.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
on
the
legal
question
then
is
that
as
long
as
there
is
no
detriment
to
either
side
it
would
be
fair
and
reasonable
within
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
you
assume,
as
the
commission
did
for
purposes
of
decision,
that
arm’s
length
bargaining
might
have
resulted
in
a
transaction
between
willing
parties,
it
would
have
been
somewhat
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
they
assumed
that
for
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gribbon,
before
you
sit
down,
could
you
answer
one
question
for
me?
i
noticed
in
the
appendix
the
report
of
professor
obsten
(ph)
and
a
series
of
questions
that
he
answered.
could
you
tell
me
who
drafted
those
questions
for
him?
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
order
indicates
that
there
was
a
five-day
period
in
which
you
could
respond
to
the
report.
did
you
so
respond?
