mr.
david
ferber
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
court
knows,
a
closed-end
investment
company,
like
a
mutual
fund,
which
is
an
open-end
investment
company,
consists
of
a
portfolio
of
securities
that
is
managed
in
the
interest
of
its
stockholders.
unlike
a
mutual
fund,
the
outstanding
stock
of
a
closed-end
investment
company
is
not
redeemable
at
the
instance
of
the
shareholder.
over
the
years,
the
stock
of
closed-end
companies
is
usually
traded
on
the
market
at
a
significant
difference
from
the
value
of
the
asset
portfolio,
usually
substantially
lower.
it
is
this
disparity
between
the
asset
value,
that
is,
the
market
value
of
the
portfolio
held
by
a
closed-end
investment
company,
in
this
case,
christiana
securities
company,
and
the
lower
value
in
the
market
of
its
own
stock,
the
christiana
stock,
that
gives
rise
to
the
difference
in
this
case
between
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
(sec)
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
case
involves
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission’s
determination
that
the
terms
of
a
proposed
merger
of
christiana
securities
company
and
e.i.
du
pont
de
nemours
&
co.
are
within
the
meaning
of
section
17(b)
of
the
investment
company
act
of
1940,
reasonable
and
fair,
and
do
not
involve
overreaching.
as
the
court
knows
du
pont
of
course
is
a
giant
industrial
company,
having
some
47
million
shareholders
and
its
stock
is
considered
to
as
a
prime
investment
quality.
christiana
is
a
closed-end
company
with
some
8,000
shareholders.
its
stock
is
traded
on
the
over-the-counter
market.
98%
of
its
assets
consist
of
du
pont
common
stock,
and
that
adds
up
to
some
28%
of
all
of
du
pont’s
stock
outstanding.
now,
the
merger
that
is
involved
here
essentially
provides
that
christiana
is
to
turn
over
all
its
assets,
consisting
almost
entirely
of
its
du
pont
stock
and
will
then
disappear.
du
pont
will
issue
its
common
stock
in
a
slightly
smaller
amount
than
the
amount
turned
in
by
christiana
to
christiana’s
shareholders.
mr.
david
ferber
yes,
it
was
formed
around
1915,
i
believe,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
du
pont
was
formed
about
the
same
time.
in
all,
there
are
13.4
roughly
shares
of
du
pont
stock
that
christiana
is
turning
into
du
pont
and
there
is
about
13.2
million
shares
that
du
pont
is
putting
back.
so
under
the
effect
of
the
transaction
is
really
a
liquidation
of
christiana
that
will
cost
its
shareholders
approximately
1.8%
of
its
assets.
now,
that
comes
to
less
than
2.5%
of
the
difference,
because
of
course
the
same
christiana
stockholders
will
become
du
pont
shareholders
and
that
accounts
for
the
difference
between
the
2.5%,
which
would
be
about
$55.6
million,
and
the
cost
of
the
merger
to
the
christiana
stockholders.
the
great
advantage
of
course
to
the,
or
one
of
the
advantages
to
the
christiana’s
stockholders
by
this
kind
of
a
merger
is
that
it
permits
the
elimination
of
christiana
without
the
heavy
tax
consequences
that
would
be
required
either
by
christiana
liquidating
by
distributing
its
du
pont
stock
to
its
christiana
shareholders,
or
by
somehow
selling
that
stock
and
distributing
the
money
to
the
shareholders.
the
advantage
--
mr.
david
ferber
as
i
understand
the
internal
revenue
people
have
approved
the
proposed
transactions.
what
it
will
do,
particularly
for
any
christiana
shareholders
which
would
want
to
sell
his
shares,
is
he
will
presumably
get
somewhere
between
20-25%
more
than
he
would
get
if
he
were
just
went
out
on
the
market
and
sold
his
christiana
stock,
because
that
has
been
20-25%
the
discount
over
the
past
few
years,
prior
to
the
announcement
of
this
merger.
the
amount
cumulatively
as
of
the
figures
in
1972,
on
which
the
record
was
based,
would
be
a
saving,
if
you
total
it
all
up
and
if
everyone
were
going
to
sell
their
stock,
which
of
course
is
not
going
to
occur,
of
some
$450
million
for
the
christiana
security
holders.
the
merger
is
subject
to
the
commission
approval
because
17(a)
of
the
act
provides
that
an
affiliate
of
an
investment
company,
which
du
pont
is
by
definition,
may
not
purchase
“any
security
or
other
property
from
such
investment
company”
unless
the
commission
finds
under
section
17(b)
of
the
act
that
the
“terms,
including
consideration
to
be
paid
or
received
are
reasonable
and
fair
and
do
not
involve
overreaching”.
the
commission
made
this
fairness
finding
on
the
ground
that
the
transaction
was
based
primarily,
almost
entirely,
upon
an
exchange
of
equivalents:
du
pont
stock
for
du
pont
stock.
using
the
market
value
of
the
christiana
stock
as
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
should
have
been
used
at
least
to
some
degree
would
of
course
deprive
the
christiana
shareholders
of
a
significant
portion
of
the
value
of
their
company’s
assets.
the
commission
also
specifically
found
that
the
du
pont
stockholders
would
be
in
no
way
injured.
they
would
be
benefited
in
fact
to
the
extent
that
each
share
would
represent
a
somewhat
greater
interest
in
du
pont,
there
being
188,500
fewer
du
pont
shares
outstanding
after
the
merger
than
before.
in
addition,
the
du
pont
company
would
get
some
$34
million
of
the
remaining
2%
of
christiana’s
assets.
the
commission
must
approve
any
application
under
section
17(b)
if
it
can
make
the
requisite
findings.
there
is
no
public
interest
consideration
that
is
spelled
into
the
statute
at
this
point,
but
the
commission
did
indicate
that
the
elimination
of
the
unnecessary
holding
company
was
sound
and
salutary,
pointing
to
the
provisions
of
section
11(b)
of
the
holding
company
act,
where
the
commission
of
course
has
been
instructed
to
get
rid
of,
and
has
over
the
years
done
so,
of
many
of
the
unnecessary
holding
companies
in
the
electric
and
gas
holding
company
systems.
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commission
erred
in
establishing
“a
rule
of
law
that
closed-end
investment
companies
should
be
presumably
worth
the
value
of
their
net
assets”.
the
court
of
appeals
held;
the
majority
of
two
judges,
that
fairness
required
the
commission
to
give
substantial
weight
to
the
market
price
of
christiana
stock.
it
stated
also
that
the
commission
had
to
find
“that
the
transaction
carries
the
earmarks
of
an
arm’s
length
bargain”.
so
in
effect
it
held,
the
commission
could
not
find
the
proposed
merger
fair
unless
du
pont
should
have
exerted
its
strategic
bargaining
position
to
extract
probably
as
much
as
several
hundred
million
dollars
worth
of
christiana’s
assets
as
consideration
for
du
pont
going
along.
i
propose
to
deal
in
the
rest
of
my
time
with
the
justification
of
the
commission’s
use
of
asset
value,
essentially
the
value
of
christiana’s
du
pont
holdings
and
the
court’s
error
in
holding,
first,
that
the
market
value
of
christiana’s
stock
was
to
be
given
substantial
weight,
and
second,
that
the
transactions
must
have
the
indicia
of
arm’s
length
bargaining
as
the
court
interpreted
that
term.
mr.
david
ferber
exactly,
the
stock
will
disappear
and
christiana
will
disappear.
the
stock
is,
in
effect,
merely
the
measure
of
what
each
of
the
--
in
other
words,
if
you
want
du
pont
shares,
you
get
so
much.
mr.
david
ferber
exactly,
your
honor.
so
that
the
christiana
people
are
being
permitted
to
own
directly
a
little
less
of
what
they
owned
indirectly
through
christiana.
i
was
about
to
say
that
mr.
gribbon
will
deal
with
suggestions
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
petitioners,
that
even
if
the
commission
would
otherwise
have
been
right,
it
could
not
approve
the
merger
because
there
was
an
insufficient
sharing
of
the
benefits,
and
because
the
alleged
detrimental
market
impact
the
merger
would
have
on
du
pont
stock.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
our
position
that
each
of
the
subjects
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with;
statutory
language,
legislative
history,
prior
commission
decisions,
and
practice
under
comparable
statutory
provisions,
that
the
commission
did
act
in
accordance
with
each
of
these.
the
use
of
the
net
asset
value,
the
value
of
christiana’s
portfolio,
is
certainly
in
accord
with
the
statutory
language.
the
words
reasonable,
fair,
not
involving
overreaching,
describing
the
terms,
including
the
consideration
to
be
paid
or
received,
describe
exactly
what
the
commission
found
to
be
an
exchange
of
equivalents;
du
pont
stock
for
du
pont
stock.
du
pont
is
not
buying,
as
the
court
of
appeals
indicated,
christiana
stock,
it
is
buying
du
pont
stocks
since
that
is
the
--
and
that
is
the
consideration
to
be
paid
within
the
statutory
language.
an
investment
company,
unlike
an
operating
company,
has
no
going
concern
value,
that
is,
a
full
investment
company.
there
are
some
that
are
so-called
hybrid
companies
that
might
have
some
business
operation
as
well
as
being
an
investment
company,
but
in
the
company
that
has
only
securities
which
have
a
market,
the
way
the
value
has
always
been
determined
by
the
commission
and
generally
in
most
instances
is,
you
measured
the
value
of
its
assets,
its
portfolio.
as
the
commission
noted,
it
said,
investment
companies
are,
as
a
general
rule,
media
for
long-term
investment.
that
makes
net
asset
value
the
touchstone
and
the
act
is
based
on
that
premise.
the
use
of
net
asset
value
also
is
in
accord
with
the
legislative
history.
the
commission
stated:
congress
chose
to
protect
closed-end
stockholders
against
dilution
of
intrinsic
value.
the
1939
study
of
the
commission
that
led
to
the
investment
company
act
showed
that
security
holders
were
often
in
need
of
protection
against
their
affiliates.
the
report
is
filled
with
numerous
examples
of
unscrupulous
managers,
who
are
entering
into
transactions
with
their
investment
company
and
diluting
the
net
asset
value.
that
many
shareholders
of
christiana
maybe
sophisticated,
unlike
perhaps
the
more
usual
situation
with
investment
companies,
does
not
mean
that
they
are
not
to
be
accorded
the
same
protections
that
congress
provided
for
all
shareholders
of
investment
companies,
and
section
17
was
the
means
congress
set
up
for
that
protection.
now,
the
court
cites
numerous
opinions
to
suggest
that
the
commission
has
not
always
found
that
net
asset
value
is
the
appropriate
test.
the
commission
has
always
said
that,
that
is
the
starting
point,
where
you
have
an
investment
company
that
does
consist,
like
christiana,
solely
of
securities.
most
of
the
other
cases
--
mr.
david
ferber
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
when
the
break
came,
i
was
just
about
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals,
we
think,
misread
the
commission’s
opinions
in
stating
that
the
commission
did
not
always
give
great
weight
to
the
net
asset
value,
that
is,
the
portfolio
value
test.
some
of
the
cases
which
the
court
of
appeals
cited
were
situations
where
the
investment
company
involved
was
what
i
described
before
as
a
hybrid
company;
a
company
that
had
enough
securities
for
investment
purposes
that
it
fell
within
the
act,
that
also
was
operating
a
business.
and
in
those
situations
the
business
would
of
course
be
valued,
as
businesses
normally
are,
in
accordance
with
its
income
and
expenses
and
so
forth.
the
other
types
of
cases,
and
there
were
several,
particularly
the
talley
case,
which
involved
the
talley-general
times
merger,
where
neither
of
the
company
was
an
investment
company,
because
section
17
is
broad
enough
to
catch
mergers
between
affiliates
of
an
investment
company.
you
have
that
situation
where
there
was
a
machinery
company
and
a
great
many
other
things
in
general
times,
which
was
a
watch
company
when
merging,
and
so
the
net
asset
value,
the
portfolio
value
of
the
stock
was
not
involved.
the
fourth
area
in
which
the
court
disagreed
with
the
commission
was
that
the
court
suggested
that
the
net
asset
value
test
of
the
commission
was
not
consistent
with
some
of
the
reorganization
statutes.
but
certainly
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
under
which
the
commission
for
many
years
in
the
1940s
and
1950s
particularly
was
conducting
reorganizations
of
electric
and
gas
utility
holding
companies.
in
those
cases,
one
thing
that
goes
through
all
the
cases
is
that
the
security
holder
is
to
receive
the
equitable
equivalent
of
what
he
is
giving
up,
and
of
course
that
seems
to
be
completely
consistent
here.
the
christiana
people
are
giving
up
du
pont
stock
and
they
are
getting
du
pont
stock.
similarly,
the
reorganizations
under
chapter
10
of
the
bankruptcy
act
have
that
same
test
of
equitable
equivalent.
one
of
the
cases
under
chapter
10,
the
central
states
electric
corporation
case,
is
very,
very
much
in
point.
central
states
at
that
time
had
as
its
two
principal
assets
two
closed-end
investment
companies.
in
the
advisory
report
of
the
commission,
they
went
into
this
question
of
how
should
they
be
valued;
according
to
what
the
stock
of
these
subsidiary
companies
were
selling
for
in
the
market,
or
according
to
what
their
holdings
were
selling
for.
it
made
a
difference
of
close
to
$4
million.
the
commission
determined
that
it
was
what
their
portfolio
securities
sold
for
in
working
out
the
value
of
this
company
for
reorganization
purposes.
the
district
court
accepted
the
commission’s
recommendation
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
affirmed,
quoting
much
of
the
language
of
the
commission’s
report.
it
said,
“the
proper
method
of
valuing
the
assets
of
an
investment
company
such
as
this
is
the
presently
realizable
market
values
of
the
securities
on
hand”.
it
was
referring
to
the
holdings
of
these
subsidiary
investment
companies,
almost
$4
million
more
than
the
market
value
of
their
own
stocks.
similarly
here
of
course
it
is
the
market
value
of
christiana’s
holdings
that
is
basic.
i
would
like
finally
to
refer
to
the
case
of
pepper
v.
litton,
which
our
opponents
in
the
court
below
cited
against
us,
which
is
sort
of
odd
since
that
is
one
of
the
cases
that
i
think
in
most
our
briefs
we
were
relying
on.
it
cited
from
mr.
justice
douglas’
language
about
arm’s
length
bargaining.
but
in
the
pepper
case,
a
person
who
owned
his
one-man
corporation
was
using
it
to
defraud
creditors,
and
in
fact
did
so
greatly
to
the
creditor’s
injury.
unlike
the
pepper
case,
as
we
have
seen
here,
no
one
has
been
injured
by
this
merger.
more
importantly,
the
pepper
case
was
a
protest
against
a
fiduciary
utilizing
what
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to
as
his
strategic
position
for
his
own
preferment.
section
17
treats
affiliates
of
an
investment
company
in
a
position
that
is
certainly
comparable
to
that
of
the
fiduciary
relationship,
to
the
investment
company.
so
here
we
have
the
respondents
claiming
that
there
should
have
been
arm’s
length
bargaining
so
that
they
can
in
effect
hold
up
christiana’s
shareholders
and
require
them
to
hand
over
something
approaching
$200
million
of
their
company’s
du
pont
stock.
as
the
commission
pointed
out,
a
principal
reason
why
section
17
of
the
investment
company
act
requires
us
to
pass
upon
the
fairness
of
transactions
such
as
this
is
to
prevent
persons
in
a
strategic
position
from
using
that
position
to
affect
transactions
for
other
than
fair
value.
surely,
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
the
commission
to
conclude
that
fairness
does
not
require
that
du
pont
use
its
strategic
position
to
deprive
christiana’s
shareholders
of
several
hundred
million
dollars
of
their
company’s
assets.
