take
it
we
should
judge
this
case
on
the
same
assumption
then
that
an
arm’s
length
bargaining
would
have
had
a
different
result,
we
should
judge
it
on

we
are
not
going
to
first
engage
in
any
independent
fact-finding
as
to
whether
or
not
arm’s
length
bargaining
would
have
produced
a
different
result.
justice

we
just
take
it
the
way
the
commission
judged
it,
even
if
it
would
have
--
it
was
--
this
is
fair
and
reasonable.

now,
the
price
was
related
to
the
actual
market
price
of
du
pont
shares?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
understand.
but
there
was
not
any
--
no
consideration
was
given
to
the
fact
that
this
block
of
du
pont
stock
had
any
potential
for
control?
justice

well,
did
the
sec
talk
about
that
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
make
any
finding
as
to
whether
there
was
a
potential
for
control?
justice
byron

white
but
in
arriving
at
their
judgment
of
value,
they
did
not
mention
this
fact?
