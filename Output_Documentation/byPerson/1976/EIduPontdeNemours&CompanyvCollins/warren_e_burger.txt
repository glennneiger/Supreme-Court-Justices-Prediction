chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
conceive
of
the
case
i
suppose
mr.
gribbon,
where
even
at
the
appellate
reviewing
level
you
could
make
a
determination,
perhaps
something
that
was
so
flagrant
that
on
its
face
it
would
be
unreasonable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
appellate
court
would
be
required
to
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
it
would
go
back
to
the
commission,
perhaps.
