mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
members
of
the
court
have
already
perceived,
this
case
presents
none
of
the
tantalizing
constitutional
issues
that
are
the
court’s
usual
fare.
indeed,
the
transaction
under
question
is
a
direct
response
to
the
vagaries
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
if
the
liquidation
of
christiana
could
be
accomplished
with
the
same
simplicity
and
lack
of
tax
consequences
that
attended
its
creation
60
years
ago,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
this
merger.
shares
of
du
pont
stock
that
pierre
du
pont
and
his
five
associates
contributed
to
christiana
would
simply
be
taken
out
of
the
vault,
broken
up
into
denominations
appropriate
to
be
distributed
to
their
successors
in
interest;
the
8,000
shareholders
of
christiana.
but,
the
taxes
consequences,
and
particularly
the
complexities
of
determining
christiana’s
accumulated
earnings
and
profits,
rule
out
a
simple
liquidation
of
its
assets.
paradoxically
however,
essentially
the
same
result
can
be
accomplished
through
a
merger
with
du
pont,
and
not
i
might
say
because
of
any
quirk
or
technicality
in
the
merger
law.
mergers
are
tax-free
because
they
involve
only
a
change
in
the
form
rather
than
in
the
substance
of
an
investment.
this
fits
that
and
has
been
ruled
to
be
a
tax-free
merger
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
now,
the
terms
of
the
merger
as
have
been
stated
call
for
du
pont
to
issue
about
13.2
million
shares
of
its
own
stock,
and
to
receive
in
turn
from
christiana
about
13.4
million
shares
and
miscellaneous
assets,
valued
at
about
$26
million
net.
now,
these
terms
reflect,
as
mr.
ferber
has
shown,
what
has
been
referred
to
as
net
asset
value,
that
is,
the
shares
of
du
pont
stock
which
represent
98%
of
christiana
are
valued
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
shares
of
du
pont
stock
which
du
pont
is
going
to
issue.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
respondents
contend
that
even
if,
as
mr.
ferber
has
shown,
the
commission
is
justified
in
saying
that
presumptively
net
asset
value
should
be
used
in
determining
the
terms
of
merger
between
an
investment
company
and
its
operating
affiliate,
but
nonetheless,
there
are
two
special
considerations
in
this
case
that
dictate
a
different
result.
now,
those
two
considerations
are:
first,
a
sharing
of
benefits
contention.
it
is
clear
from
the
terms
and
has
been
recognized
that
the
christiana
shareholders
will
receive
greater
benefits
than
the
du
pont
people.
the
second
reason
why
it
is
said
that
the
net
asset
value
should
not
control
is
an
apprehension
that
the
merger
will
cause
a
significant
adverse
market
impact
in
the
value
of
the
du
pont
stock.
these
are
the
two
contentions
i
propose
to
deal
with,
and
i
believe
that
an
understanding
of
a
little
of
the
background
of
this
transaction
maybe
helpful
in
viewing
those
two
contentions.
when
christiana
proposed
a
merger,
the
du
pont
management
considered
it
and
concluded
that
such
a
transaction
would
cause
no
detriment
to
du
pont
company
or
its
stockholders
and
would
bring
about
certain
significant
benefits.
now,
the
principal
benefit
that
the
management
saw
was
the
dispersion
of
the
block
of
du
pont’s
stock,
some
28%
of
du
pont,
presently
in
the
hands
of
christiana.
that
dispersion,
in
the
view
of
the
management,
would
remove
that
block
as
a
target
for
people,
unlike
christiana,
who
are
inexperienced
in
the
chemical
business
and
who
might
do
harm
or
threaten
to
do
harm
to
du
pont.
now,
i
recognize
that
the
commission
was
less
than
greatly
impressed
by
the
magnitude
of
that
benefit,
but
that
benefit
as
far
as
the
du
pont
management
was
concerned,
was
and
remains
the
basic
reason
for
this
transaction
from
du
pont’s
viewpoint.
the
commission
did
agree
completely
that
the
transaction
would
have
no
detriment
to
du
pont
or
its
shareholders,
and
the
court
of
appeals
took
no
exception
to
that.
both
the
commission
and
the
court
agreed
that
in
general
the
elimination
of
companies
such
as
christiana
was
in
the
public
interest
in
terms
of
corporate
democracy
and
elimination
of
proliferation
of
holding
companies.
now,
in
connection
with
the
merger,
both
christiana
and
du
pont
sought
outside
legal
and
financial
guidance
as
to
the
terms
upon
which
a
merger
would
be
appropriate.
both
of
them
were
advised
independently
that
the
established
practice
in
the
merger
of
investment
companies
into
their
operating
affiliates
was
that
the
terms
represent
net
asset
value
with
perhaps
a
discount
premium
of
modest
amount
depending
upon
individual
circumstances.
now,
an
exhibit
prepared
by
one
of
the
advisors,
which
appears
at
687
of
the
record,
collects
in
short
form
the
ten
most
comparable
transactions
that
had
occurred;
six
of
them
had
been
approved
by
the
commission,
and
four
of
them
had
not
been
approved
by
the
commission.
the
important
thing,
and
this
it
is
unchallenged,
that
this
is
an
accurate
statement
of
prior
practice
in
this
area.
every
one
of
those
transactions
was
done
at
net
asset
value.
now,
what
this
background
suggests,
indeed
shows
i
submit,
is
that
the
merger
terms
were
developed
with
the
assistance
of
outside
financial
and
legal
guidance
in
an
effort
by
both
sides
to
arrive
at
what
terms
would
first
reflect
established
financial
practice,
and
second,
reflect
the
decision
of
the
commission
under
section
17.
the
ultimate
authority
of
the
commission
to
find
out
whether
these
terms
were
fair,
reasonable,
or
reflected
overreaching
was
recognized
from
the
outset
of
the
negotiations.
there
was
never
any
attempt
to
put
anything
over
on
anybody.
now,
the
fact
that
these
merger
negotiations
were
carried
out
in
this
manner
may
not
necessarily
be
the
end
of
the
inquiry
and
i
do
not
suggest
it
is.
i
do
say
that
it
is
the
complete
answer
to
the
charge
that
respondents
make,
which
was
accepted
in
part
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
messrs.
mccoy
and
shapiro
on
the
du
pont
side
laid
down
and
played
dead
for
their
christiana
masters.
the
fact
is
that
the
terms
that
they
obtained
for
du
pont
turned
out
to
be
the
most
favorable
terms
for
du
pont
that
the
commission
would
have
approved.
the
commission
specifically
said
it
would
not
have
allowed
anything
to
be
significantly
better
than
the
terms
that
messrs.
mccoy
and
shapiro
got
for
du
pont
in
these
negotiations.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
benefits.
the
benefits
that
we
are
talking
about
here
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
said
that
it
was
at
the
upper
part
of
the
range,
that
something
lower
would
have
been
satisfactory,
but
nothing
significantly
higher.
it
is
at
the
very
end
of
its
opinion,
i
do
not
have
the
quote,
i
could
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
35,
on
the
top
of
page
36
in
the
appendix
on
petition.
these
benefits
are
of
two
kinds:
first,
the
7%
inter-corporate
dividend
tax
that
christiana
now
pays
as
a
corporation
is
obviously
going
to
be
eliminated
when
it
ceases
to
be
a
corporation.
in
addition,
the
market
value
of
the
du
pont
stock,
which
the
christiana
shareholders
receive,
will
be
higher
than
the
present
market
value
of
the
christiana
stock
which
they
hold.
the
reason
being
that
they
are
permitted
by
doing
through
a
merger
to
get
that
stock
in
their
hands
and
defer
the
taxes
that
would
be
payable
had
they
received
that
stock
through
a
liquidation
at
this
time.
so
we
have
a
combination
of
a
saving
of
the
7%
tax
and
a
deferral
of
the
tax
that
might
be
payable
were
this
done
through
a
liquidation
rather
than
through
a
merger.
the
commission
refused
to
direct
the
sharing
of
these
benefits,
essentially
for
the
same
reason
that
it
felt
that
the
investment
company
act
required
it
to
look
to
net
asset
value
in
these
transactions.
sharing
of
benefits
here
is
really
a
euphemism
for
dividing
what
belongs
to
christiana.
they
said,
the
commission,
the
objective
of
the
investment
company
act
was
to
protect
investment
company’s
shareholders
and
not
to
take
things
away
from
them,
and
therefore,
we
do
not
regard
it
as
fair
to
have
any
significant
division
of
the
property
values
of
the
christiana
shareholders.
in
substance,
the
shareholders
of
all
investment
companies,
when
they
come
to
dispose
of
their
assets
are
in
essence
wards
of
the
commission.
it
is
the
commission
that
makes
the
final
determination
as
to
the
terms
on
which
they
are
going
to
be
able
to
sell,
and
the
commission
had
very
much
in
mind
that
it
was
the
protection
of
investment
company
shareholders,
even
though
some
of
them
maybe
wealthy
and
even
though
they
may
carry
the
name
du
pont,
they
are
the
ones
that
are
protected
under
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
could
have
disapproved,
but
the
commission
went
out
of
its
way
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
the
commission
took
the
view,
and
i
think
quite
properly,
that
in
one
of
these
transactions,
to
look
out
for
the
shareholders
of
both
companies,
not
just
the
investment
company,
but
for
the
shareholders
of
the
affiliate
and
for
the
management
of
both
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
cannot
your
honor
attach
any
precise
significance
to
the
use
of
that,
i
think
it
is
fairly
common
drafting
of
legislation
to
use
a
lot
of
words,
and
i
think
this
just
may
have
occurred
to
somebody
as
being
a
stopgap.
it
is
hard
for
me
to
see
a
transaction
that
is
fair
and
reasonable,
but
is
set
aside
because
there
is
overreaching,
maybe,
i
should
think
they
are
substantial
equivalents.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes.
well,
to
put
it
the
other
way,
it
would
be
unfair
and
unreasonable
to
take
from
the
christiana
shareholders
any
significant
part
of
their
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
think
that
is
right.
if
in
fact,
as
the
commission
was
prepared
to
assume,
there
might
have
been
a
different
transaction,
and
this
is
highly
speculative
whether
there
would
have
been
different
terms
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
assumed
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
if
that
is
the
case
then
i
think
the
investment
company
act
creates
an
entirely
new
standard;
one
of
fair,
reasonable,
and
lack
of
overreaching.
now,
the
second
reason
why
the
commission
declined
to
engage
in
the
sharing
of
benefits
was
that
it
felt
that
it
should
not
use
its
powers
under
the
investment
company
act
in
effect
to
supplement
the
terms
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
say
it
might
have
had
a
different
result,
i
think
that
is
what
the
commission
was
saying.
i
think,
yes,
the
answer
is
that
if
you
can
conceive
that
an
arm’s
length
transaction
might
have
had
it,
then
the
question
is,
do
the
terms
of
section
17,
which
the
commission
found
to
be
fully
carried
out
here,
fall
by
the
wayside
because
somebody
thinks
that
an
arm’s
length
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
i
would
not
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
this
is
fair
and
reasonable
and
reflects
no
overreaching.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
in
that
event
i
should
think
you
would
be
reversing
the
commission’s
finding
that
there
was
no
overreaching.
i
find
difficulty
between
those
two
tests.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
would
be
justified
i
think
in
doing
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
go
back
to
it.
let
me
suggest
to
you
that
in
niagara
hudson,
this
court
said
that
the
judgment
of
the
commission
has
been
designated
by
congress
as
the
appropriate
guide
to
fairness
under
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
i
suggest
that
similarly
in
the
investment
company
act,
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
commission
as
the
appropriate
guide
to
fairness.
that
has
been
designated
by
the
congress
and
the
commission
has
made
that
determination.
but
in
urging
deference
to
the
commission’s
informed
judgment,
under
the
niagara
hudson
principle,
i
do
not
need
to
concede
in
the
slightest
that
any
genuine
doubt
has
been
raised
on
this
record
as
to
the
correctness
of
that
judgment.
consider
first
the
ten
similar
mergers
of
investment
companies,
all
that
could
be
found
by
anybody
involved
in
this
transaction,
and
every
single
one
of
them
was
done
on
the
same
principle.
now,
are
we
to
conclude
that
all
of
the
people
involved
in
those
transactions
and
all
of
the
members
of
the
commission
who
approved
them
from
time
to
time
were
either
misguided
or
venal,
as
the
respondents
charged
du
pont
and
christiana?
next,
three
experienced
investment
bankers,
each
independently
looked
at
these
terms
and
approved
them,
and
in
doing
so
they
put
their
integrity
and
their
reputations
on
the
line,
and
i
suggest
it
is
significant
that
in
the
five
years
that
this
transaction
has
been
in
gestation,
not
a
single
member
of
the
financial
community
has
come
forward
and
suggested
that
there
was
any
flaw
in
these
terms.
i
think
one
can
be
assured
that
a
transaction
of
this
size
has
had
considerable
scrutiny
throughout
the
financial
community.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
yes,
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
but
as
the
du
pont
shares
predominant
value
or
upper
value
floats
--
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
control
premium?
no,
du
pont
would
not.
there
was
some
discussion
by
the
christiana
negotiators
that
instead
of
a
discount
from
that
value,
they
were
entitled
to
a
premium,
and
du
pont
refused
to
do
anything
like
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
did
not
address
itself
to
that
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
they
said
there
was
under
their
act,
there
was
a
presumption
of
control
under
the
investment
company
act
with
an
ownership
of
more
than
25%.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
no,
your
honor.
now,
what
of
the
commission’s
unanimous
approval
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
15
months
of
deliberation,
i
ask
whether
there
is
any
rational
basis
for
believing
that
this
public,
non-partisan
body,
with
the
full
support
of
its
extensive
staff,
with
full
knowledge
of
christiana’s
long
relationship
with
du
pont,
failed
either
wittingly
or
unwittingly
to
balance
the
interest
of
the
225,000
public
du
pont
stockholders
against
the
interest
of
the
many
few
christiana
shareholders?
on
the
contrary,
there
is
every
reason
to
conclude
that
the
commission
gave
the
transaction
the
very
unbiased
scrutiny
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
intended
by
congress.
and
finally,
a
federal
district
court,
after
an
extended
evidentiary
hearing,
has
given
the
transaction
its
blessing.
what
then
is
there
on
the
other
side
that
suggests
doubt
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
commission’s
informed
judgment?
two
things:
first,
the
unsupported
claims
of
two
out
of
du
pont’s
225,000
stockholders,
with
no
particularly
relevant
experience,
that
du
pont
should
exact
a
heavy
price
for
cooperation
in
determination
of
christiana’s
existence;
and
second,
concurrence
in
that
view
by
two
members
of
the
reviewing
court
who
found
it
highly
significant
and
important
enough
to
observe
that
the
du
pont
family,
not
christiana,
but
the
du
pont
family,
had
for
many
years
retained
the
economic,
political,
and
social
advantages
that
a
company
control
of
one
of
america’s
largest
enterprises.
to
what
extent
that
entered
into
their
opinion
is
not
clear,
but
it
was
important
enough
that
they
made
specific
mention,
something
like
a
bill
of
retainer
(ph).
i
submit
that
weighed
against
these
two
considerations,
the
commission’s
informed
judgment
stands
clean
and
untarnished
and
is
wholly
acceptable.
i
should
now
like
to
turn
to
the
contention
of
the
respondent
murtaugh.
he
alone
asserts
as
a
reason
for
rejecting
the
merger
terms
or
indeed
for
prohibiting
the
merger,
an
apprehension
that
the
merger
will
have
a
serious
adverse
impact
on
the
market
value
of
du
pont
stock.
now,
the
commission
gave
this
contention
the
most
careful
consideration.
the
entire
evidentiary
hearing
in
substance
was
taken
up.
what
that
hearing
disclosed
was
that
the
murtaugh
contention
rests
upon
market
impact
concerns
that
were
expressed
with
respect
to
certain
plans
having
to
do
with
du
pont’s
divestiture
of
general
motors
stock
pursuant
to
the
order
of
this
court
in
the
early
1960s.
the
commission
correctly
found
that
this
merger
and
the
general
motors
divestiture
have
nothing
in
common.
there
were
two
essential
characteristics
of
the
general
motors
merger
that
gave
rise
to
the
apprehension
that
it
would
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
value
of
the
general
motors
stock:
the
first
of
these
were
that
substantial
sales
of
the
general
motors
stock
each
year,
over
a
period
of
ten
years,
were
ordered
by
the
court,
creating
a
very
substantial
overhang
for
a
ten-year
period.
the
second
essential
characteristic
was
that
there
was
bound
to
be
substantial
unorganized
selling
by
the
individual
shareholders
of
du
pont
who
would
be
receiving
the
general
motors
stock
as
a
dividend,
taxable
at
ordinary
income
tax
rates,
that
the
record
showed
would
average
at
about
60%.
it
was
thus
these
two
characteristics;
fore
selling
and
tax
selling,
which
did
give
rise
to
reasonable
apprehension
of
market
impact,
and
were
one
of
the
factors
that
led
to
legislation.
this
transaction
is
entirely
tax-free.
nobody
has
to
pay
any
taxes,
nobody
has
to
sell
any
stock
to
raise
any
money
to
pay
taxes,
and
there
is
no
required
selling
by
court
order
or
otherwise.
indeed,
the
record
shows
and
the
commission
found
that
there
are
strong
reasons
here
for
suggesting
that
holding
for
investment
rather
than
selling
will
be
the
course
followed
by
the
former
christiana
shareholders.
du
pont
is
an
issue
of
prime
investment.
they
have
been
holding
it
in
substance
for
many
years
and
they
have
no
occasion
to
consider
a
change
in
their
investment.
the
owners
of
about
70%
of
the
stock,
the
record
shows,
have
no
intention
of
selling.
over
half
of
the
christiana
stock
is,
for
all
practical
purposes,
locked
in
because
the
holders
have
either
no
basis
or
zero
basis
as
a
result
of
the
distribution
of
the
general
motors
stock,
that
locked-in
position
being
a
substantial
disincentive
to
any
kind
of
selling.
about
75%
of
the
christiana
stock
is
held
by
affiliates
of
du
pont
who
can
dispose
of
substantial
amounts
only
in
carefully
regulated
transactions.
now,
the
commission
went
on
to
say,
even
if
we
assume
with
murtaugh
that
there
will
be
some
substantial
selling,
we
nonetheless
feel
that
it
is
inappropriate
for
us
at
the
commission
to
attempt
to
predict
what
the
stock
market
behavior
is
going
to
be.
it
did
that
for
basically
two
reasons:
first,
the
merger
would
not
alter
du
pont’s
investment
quality
in
the
slightest,
and
no
effect
on
its
earnings,
on
its
assets,
or
on
its
prospects,
so
there
would
be
no
effect
there.
the
second
was
that
everybody
would
be
free
to
follow
his
own
personal
interests
because
there
would
be
no
uneconomic
factors
that
would
cause
either
buying
or
selling.
in
these
circumstances,
the
commission
concluded
that
it
should
not
attempt
to
speculate
on
stock
market
behavior
in
determining
the
fairness
of
this
transaction.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
the
record
discloses
only
that
the
court
drafted
those
questions.
mr.
daniel
m.
gribbon
we
did
so
respond.
i
think
the
commission
so
responded.
but
i
believe,
now
that
your
honor
has
raised
that,
that
the
eighth
circuit
going
to
professor
obsten
really
reflects
the
complexities
of
these
problems
and
the
reason
why
it
is
the
commission,
rather
than
either
the
reviewing
court
or
a
professor
of
business
history,
who
ought
to
be
passing
on
them.
professor
obsten
produced
for
the
court
what
is
really
a
whole
new
record.
it
is
in
here,
it
is
about
45
pages.
the
commission
never
saw
that.
and
it
is
not
the
lawyers
who
were
supposed
to
look
at
the
evidence,
it
is
the
commission
who
is
supposed
to
look
at
the
evidence.
to
some
extent,
and
we
will
never
know
how
much,
professor
obsten
and
the
data
he
produced
did
influence
the
two
members
of
that
court
to
substitute
their
views
for
that
of
the
commission.
