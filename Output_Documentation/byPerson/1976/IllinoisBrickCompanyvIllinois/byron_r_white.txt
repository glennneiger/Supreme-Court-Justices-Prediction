justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
illinois
brick
case,
the
plaintiffs
were
several
hundred
local
governmental
units
in
the
state
of
illinois.
they
brought
a
treble-damage
action
against
the
manufacturers
of
concrete
building
block.
they
alleged
that
the
contractors
had
conspired
illegally
to
inflate
the
price
of
the
block
and
that
they
had
passed
on
the
overcharge
to
the
plaintiffs
who
had
to
pay
more,
therefore,
for
the
buildings
and
other
structures
for
which
they
have
contracted.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
for
one
standing,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
in
doing
so
rejected
the
defendant's
claim
that
under
hanover
shoe
decision
decided
in
this
court
some
nine
or
10
years
ago
that
the
only
person
who's
injured
in
their
property
or
their
business
for
purposes
of
antitrust
laws
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
suit
were
the
direct
purchasers
namely
the
masonry
contractors
or
the
other
general
contractors
you
have
purchased
directly
from
the
--
from
the
manufacturers
of
the
block.
we
have
granted
certiorari
and
we
reversed.
we
think
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
and
the
contract
--
and
the
defendants
were
right
in
their
reading
of
--
of
hanover
shoe
and
their
understanding
that
--
and
in
the
understanding
of
the
--
of
the
contractors
that
under
that
case
only
direct
purchasers
are
persons
injured
in
their
business
or
their
property.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
have
joined
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
