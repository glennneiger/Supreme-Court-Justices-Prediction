mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
essentially
three
points
that
we
wish
to
make
this
morning.
first
is
that
the
constitution
does
not
define
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
capital
crime.
secondly,
we
submit
that
condemning
death
for
rape
under
any
and
all
circumstances
would
have
far-reaching
consequences
over
and
beyond
this
particular
case,
and
over
and
beyond
the
question
vis-à-vis
rape,
that
is,
capital
punishment
vis-à-vis
rape.
our
third
point
that
we
would
wish
to
stress
is
recidivism
and
violent
crime.
the
court
has
noted
that
the
wisdom
of
capital
punishment
is
generally
a
matter
for
the
legislative
forum.
we
submit
that
this
reflects
the
wisdom
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
that
the
legislative
judgment
is
bound
primarily
in
this
area
by
the
eighth
amendment.
now,
the
court
in
the
gregg
series
of
opinions
has
held
that
death
for
murder
is
not
unconstitutional
regardless
of
the
offense,
regardless
of
the
offender
and
regardless
of
the
procedure
involved.
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
fathom
how
a
constitutional
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
rape
and
murder.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
i
would
concede
that.
i
would
submit
--
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
on
the
basis
of
the
plurality
in
gregg
and
the
concurrences,
i
think
i
would
be
forced
to
concede.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
yes
i
would,
and
for
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
yes
and
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
have
in
effect
conceded
that
disproportionality
is
a
measure
of
constitutional
review
in
this
type
of
case.
the
point
that
i
wish
to
draw
in
terms
of
murder
and
rape
is
that
the
statutes
are
not
designed
to
execute
all
murderers.
for
the
same
reason,
the
statute
is
certainly
not
designed
to
execute
all
rapists.
the
point
is
that
some
rapes
can
be
viewed,
not
only
can
be
but
are
viewed,
by
society
just
as
serious
and
calling
for
severe
sanctions,
just
as
many
murders
are.
in
fact
some
rapes,
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
the
character
of
the
offender,
would
call
for
more
public
condonation
than
many
murders,
based
on
the
fact
that
many,
many
murders
occur
among
friends,
amongst
family
members
and
rape
of
course
seldom
involves
that
situation,
not
to
say
that
it
does
not
occur,
but
it
is
generally
a
situation
where
the
victim
is
a
stranger
to
the
offender.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
the
crime
of
rape
is
not
defined
in
terms
of
rape
and
aggravated
rape.
we
simply
have
one
definition.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
yes,
defined
as
--
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
there
is
not.
we
have
just
simple
rape
and
statutory
rape.
however,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
general
assembly
authorizes
death
as
a
permissible
penalty
for
rape
written
into
the
capital
punishment
statute,
is
in
effect
an
aggravating
element
and
that
we
have
to
read
both
together
and
to
that
extent,
although
we
do
not
have
degrees
of
rape,
just
in
terms
of
defining
the
crime
as
a
matter
of
practice
before
a
death
penalty
would
be
authorized
in
any
particular
rape
case.
it
would
be
in
the
nature
of
some
type
of
aggravated
crime.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
to
the
extent
that
the
jury
could
always
refuse
to
return
a
death
verdict,
that
may
well
be
true,
but
it
would
also
be
true
in
a
murder
case.
the
jury
is
always
free
to
ignore
the
instructions.
in
the
general
case,
the
aggravating
circumstances
would
be
charged
to
the
jury
and
they
would
pass
on
those.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
any
capital
--
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
however,
i
should
point
out
and
it
is
important
that
this
point
be
noted
and
that
is
the
mere
fact
that
a
particular
aggravating
circumstance
is
present
does
not
mean
that
that
death
sentence
will
be
affirmed.
in
other
words,
the
presence
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
a
mere
pre-requisite
to
even
considering
the
imposition
of
the
supreme
penalty,
and
not
--
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
the
circumstances,
the
aggravating
circumstances
themselves,
we
submit,
provide
the
standards.
now,
one
or
more
–
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
effect
define
the
standards.
they
are
the
standards,
in
other
words.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
the
aggravating
circumstances,
mr.
justice
marshall,
appear
in
our
code
at
section
27-2534.1.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
i
am
reading
from
our
code
annotated.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
yes,
that
is
at
page
8
of
the
petitioner’s
brief
and
particularly
it
is
on
page
9.
the
10
aggravating
circumstances
are
listed.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
in
this
particular
case,
the
aggravating
circumstances
were,
number
one:
the
prior
record
of
convictions
for
a
capital
felony
and
number
two,
the
petitioner
was
also
engaged
--
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
that
one
perhaps
has
been
the
occasion
for
more
litigation
and
argument
than
the
others.
that
is
not
present
in
this
case.
that
circumstance
was
not
charged
and
of
course
it
was
not
found.
numbers
one
and
two
were
charged
and
were
found.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
i
believe
there
was
a
charge
on
armed
robbery,
but
the
jury
did
not
find
that.
the
petitioner
has
submitted
that
this
case
would
not
have
or
that
is
a
decision
in
his
favor
would
not
have
much
impact
beyond
his
case,
we
disagree.
we
disagree
for
this
reason.
the
recourse
available
to
society,
if
society
determines
that
certain
non-homicidal
crimes
must
be
punished
and
deterred
and
that
terms
of
imprisonment
are
not
sufficient,
the
alternative
is
to
amend
the
constitution,
assuming
that
the
court
has
ruled
in
the
petitioner’s
favor.
and
that
would
be
because
we
submit
the
case
would
be
construed
as
having
consequences
beyond
just
a
crime
of
rape,
specifically
the
exception
noted
in
the
gregg
opinion
were
crimes
where
the
offender
has
not
taken
the
life
of
the
victim.
although
the
opinion
here
would
obviously
be
concerned
with
rape,
it
would
be
construed,
we
submit
much
more
broadly
and
that
constitutional
amendment
would
be
the
only
conceivable
recourse.
and
that
as
a
practical
matter
would
be
very
difficult
and
revision
in
light
of
future
experience
would
be
very
difficult.
now,
we
do
not
know
--
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
that
is
my
argument
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
i
have
two
categories
in
mind
and
that
is
in
effect
concerning
yourself,
that
is
society
concerning
itself
with
the
violent
recidivist,
regardless
of
the
nature
of
his
crime.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
not
necessarily.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
well,
it
is
hard
to
be
drawing
a
line
as
to
say
where
or
who
would
draw
the
line.
i
think
that
would
be
a
legislative
judgment,
but
i
would
look
for
the
recidivist
who
has
committed
prior
capital
crimes
such
as
we
have
in
our
statute.
if
he
has
killed,
if
he
has
maimed
and
continues
to
do
so,
then
society
needs
to
protect
itself
from
that
individual.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
i
am
not
responding
really
to
the
particular
crime
where
he
does
kill
the
victim.
certainly,
if
he
has
killed
before
and
he
attempts
to
kill
again,
if
he
commits
another
armed
robbery
or
has
killed
or
has
seriously
maimed
the
victim,
if
he
has
this
type
of
record
and
he
commits
another
armed
robbery,
it
should
be
permissible
to
deter
that
specific
individual
from
further
such
acts.
now,
in
terms
of
general
crimes
--
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
i
want
to
move
to
what
i
call
specific
deterrence
as
opposed
to
general
deterrence
or
incapacitation,
i
was
referring
to
incapacitation
in
terms
of
that
individual.
also
before
i
move
on
to
that
point,
other
crimes
that
may
come
to
the
forefront
in
the
years
to
come
or
perhaps
in
this
day
in
time
are
just
in
the
formative
stages
and
the
past
10
years
we
have
seen
aircraft
hijacking
become
somewhat
of
an
everyday
occurrence
in
the
newspapers.
fortunately,
it
has
been
curbed
in
recent
years
and
also
in
a
similar
vein,
hostage
taking
has
become
very
popular.
in
future
years,
terrorism
of
that
sort
may
continue
to
increase
and
when
we
have
hostages
taken,
if
we
have
injuries
to
those
hostages,
the
disruption
of
the
governmental
process
that
is
the
type
of
thing
that
we
cannot
be
sure
of.
and
of
course,
if
those
hostages
or
the
acts
engaged
in
result
in
death,
that
would
be
permissible
to
execute
them
there
if
they
are
prosecuted
for
murder.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
yes,
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
goes
to
the
integrity
of
your
democracy.
i
think
that
is
a
justification,
perhaps.
we
put
our
freedom
and
our
form
of
government
on
a
pedestal
and
although
that
is
historically
been
a
capital
crime,
i
have
not
given
much
thought
to
the
point
because
of
its
fortunate
rarity.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
to
my
knowledge,
treason
is
a
crime.
i
am
not
sure
if
we
have
a
separate
crime
of
espionage
and
in
my
lifetime
i
cannot
recall
anyone
being
tried
for
treason.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
in
response
to
that
your
honors,
as
i
understand
the
question,
what
impact
the
plurality
in
gregg
would
have
on
the
case
such
as
the
rosenberg
spy
trial?
did
i
understand
it
correctly,
your
honor?
as
i
have
read
the
plurality
in
gregg,
there
must
be
a
two-step
process.
first
is
the
crime
served
or
does
the
punishment
serve
any
legitimate
government
interest,
not
necessarily
that
this
would
be
the
best
punishment
and
number
two,
is
it
disproportionate
and
if
the
impact
is
to
say
that
capital
punishment
is
unconstitutional
if
a
life
is
not
taken,
it
reverts
us
to
a
contemporary
form
of
the
eye-for-an-eye,
for
instance.
we
submit
that
society
should
not
be
relegated
to
such
a
simplistic
formula
that
in
many
instances,
the
need
to
deter
such
crimes
that
would
go
to
the
very
foundation
of
your
government
would
be
the
sufficient
justification
to
promote
the
taking
of
a
life
when
none
has
in
fact
been
taken,
that
is
none
have
been
taken
directly.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
the
logic
behind
that
question
would
perhaps
be
sound
if
we
had
a
mandatory
system
where
the
offender
would
be
executed
just
for
committing
the
rape,
would
absolutely
be
executed.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
well,
in
the
mandatory
systems
that
woodson
in
effect,
threw
out,
that
point
would
have
more
validity.
in
the
discretionary
system,
i
do
not
feel
that
it
has
much
validity.
number
one,
our
statute
gives
the
rapist
the
incentive
not
to
harm.
if
he
does
murder,
the
likelihood
of
the
chances
that
he
will
receive
a
death
verdict
are
increased
tremendously
and
if
the
fear
of
capital
punishment
deters
in
the
sense
of
saving
victims’
lives,
we
submit
that
it
would
also
have
a
fall-down
effect.
in
other
words,
that
if
life
taking
is
deterred
that
the
tendency
to
harm
the
victim
would
also
be
deterred
somewhat,
such
as
the
armed
robber
who
goes
into
the
convenience
store
for
the
stick-up,
he
would
be
deterred
from
taking
a
gun
perhaps
into
the
store,
fearing
that
he
would
commit
murder
in
the
course
of
the
armed
robbery.
if
he
chooses
not
to
take
his
gun
into
the
store,
perhaps
he
will
not
even
commit
the
armed
robbery
at
all.
therefore,
in
our
system,
the
incentive
is
not
to
harm
your
rape
victim.
if
you
do,
that
still
does
not
mean
that
you
will
be
executed.
our
third
point
is
recidivism
and
violent
crime
and
i
have
touched
on
that
briefly
before
and
the
question
is
simply
what
is
society
to
do
with
the
incorrigible
recidivist
who
has
not
only
demonstrated
that
he
will
rape
again,
but
also
demonstrated
that
he
will
likely
kill
or
seriously
injure
those
whom
he
rapes.
now,
the
petitioner
has
stated
that
he
was
not
tried
under
a
recidivist
theory.
well,
we
disagree
with
that
completely.
first,
the
aggravating
circumstance
under
which
he
was
found
guilty
that
we
noted
before
is
the
prior
conviction
of
a
capital
felony
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
basis
for
such
an
aggravating
circumstance
or
that
the
theory
underlying
that
specific
aggravating
circumstance
is
specific
deterrence
that
is
to
deter,
to
preclude
that
particular
individual
from
committing
further
violent
crimes
to
incapacitate
that
particular
criminal
and
that
has
been
recognized
in
many
of
the
so-called
mandatory
statutes.
in
fact
in
texas,
it
is
required
that
it
be
determined
that
the
offender
will
likely
engage
in
further
serious
violent
crime.
that
was
the
basis
of
this
aggravating
circumstance.
it
was
relied
on
heavily
by
the
state
and
we
submit
that
was
the
primary
basis
upon
which
he
was
tried
as
a
recidivist.
when
we
look
at
the
specific
crimes
involved
here,
we
see
three
prior
rapes,
two
pertaining
to
the
same
victim.
one
victim
was
severely
injured.
the
other
victim
was
killed.
now,
the
particular
victim
in
this
case
was
not
harmed
over
and
beyond
the
rape
itself,
but
we
submit
that,
to
deter
those
who
demonstrate
their
recidivism
such
as
this
petitioner,
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
punishing
death
for
rape
should
not
hinge
on
the
fact
that
he
did
not
harm
his
most
recent
victim.
in
fact,
the
quickness
with
which
he
was
apprehended
perhaps
saved
this
victim
from
a
fate
similar
to
her
predecessors.
mr.
b.
dean
grindle,
jr.
our
parole
board
will
review
a
life
sentence
or
we
will
review
one
serving
a
life
sentence
after
seven
years
and
mr.
coker
would
be
sentenced
to
life,
if
his
death
sentence
is
vacated.
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
the
observation
that
mr.
justice
white
made
in
roberts
and
that
is
that
death
finally
forecloses
the
possibility
that
a
prisoner
will
commit
further
crimes,
whereas
life
imprisonment
does
not.
thank
you.
