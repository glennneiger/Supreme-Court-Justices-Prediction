have
any
study
been
made
of
what
happens
in
the
states
that
long
since
abolished
capital
punishment?
like
maine,
for
example,
what
did
they
do?
unknown
speaker
you
do
concede,
i
suppose,
general
grindle,
do
you
not,
that
dsproportionality
is
one
of
the
criteria,
one
of
the
ingredients
in
a
constitutional
determination
of
whether
a
punishment
is
cruel
or
unusual.
in
other
words,
you
would
concede,
i
suppose,
that
the
imposition
of
the
penalty
of
death
for
running
though
a
red
light
would
be
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
so
that
is
conceding
that
disproportionality
can
be
a
dispositive
ingredient
in
the
determination
of
what
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
would,
would
you
not?
you
would
concede,
would
you
not
that
the
death
penalty
for
stealing
ten
cents
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
anything
this
court
has
held,
would
you
not
as
a
constitutional
lawyer
concede
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
does
georgia
a
distinction
in
its
law
between
rape
and
aggravated
rape?
do
you
have
two
separate
statutes?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
that
is
in
the
brief,
is
this
the
only
rape
statute
in
georgia?
unknown
speaker
but
no
statutory
definition
of
aggravated
rape?
unknown
speaker
no,
they
are
for
any
offense.
unknown
speaker
numbers
1,
2
and
7
apply
to
rape.
unknown
speaker
in
that
connection,
i
asked
the
other
question
not
because
georgia
might
or
might
not
have
the
statute
relating
to
espionage
or
treason,
but
because
the
decision
in
this
case
would
certainly
bear
upon
federal
crimes
or
federal
treatment
of
those
crimes
and
justice
rehnquistâ€™s
question
is
similarly
directed.
unknown
speaker
if
the
death
penalty
is
not
imposed
on
this
man,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
he
will
be
eligible
for
a
statutory
release
arbitrarily
at
some
point?
