mr.
kendall,
before
you
proceed,
if
we
have
a
prison
inmate
who
has
been
convicted
of
aggravated
rape
and
sentenced
to
life,
a
mandatory
life
sentence
under
the
statute
that
forbids
parole
and
the
inmate
escapes
and
commits
another
aggravated
rape,
what
punishment
do
you
think
would
be
appropriate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
that
be
any
punishment
for
that
individual?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
same
way
it
was
protected
on
the
first
go-around.
i
say
it
would
be
protected
to
the
same
extent
that
it
had
been
protected
after
his
first
conviction
for
rape.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yet
he
escaped.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
am
not
talking
about
coker,
i
was
asking
your
view
as
to
whether
or
not
there
could
ever
be
a
situation
where
absent
any
other
punishment,
capital
punishment
would
be
appropriate
for
repetitive
crimes
of
rape.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
deterrents
would
exist
in
the
circumstances
i
described?
