e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
75-5444,
coker
v.
georgia.
mr.
kendall,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
there
are
some
extenuating
circumstances
here
on
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
mentioned
the
irreversibility
of
the
death
penalty
as
one
of
the
bases
for
its
infirmity,
constitutionally.
i
wonder
if
you
would
expand
a
little
on
that.
how
does
that
enter
in
this
case
in
any
different
way
from
in
any
other
capital
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
concepts
there
really,
have
you
not,
the
generality
applying
to
the
penalty
in
all
cases
and
its
application
to
the
particular
case?
now,
irreversibility
is
usually
advanced
to
us
as
an
argument
because
of
the
possibility
of
error
in
the
judgment
and
do
you
argue
that
in
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
mean
error
in
that
sense.
i
meant
i
was
directing
my
observation
about
error
to
the
argument
usually
advanced
here
that
the
death
penalty
is
obviously
irreversible
and
you
might
execute
the
wrong
person
that
is
a
person
is
not
guilty.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
kendall.

justice

georgia?
chief
justice

you
