georgia
also
authorizes
the
death
penalty,
you
have
already
told
us,
for
armed
robbery,
does
it
not?
justice

and
for
kidnapping,
does
it
not?
justice

so
in
non-homicide
cases,
the
death
penalty
can
be
imposed
for
five
different
offenses
under
georgia
law?
justice
potter
stewart
despite
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
surely
you
do
not
suggest
that
this
court’s
furman
decision
represents
a
community
consensus
that
would
be
the
same
as
if
those
17
states
had
themselves
repealed
the
statute,
so
you?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
in
time
do
you
give
them
to
react
under
your
standard
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
anybody
who
is
serving
a
life
sentence
without
a
hope
of
pardon
or
parole
who
escapes
can
with
practical
impunity
commit
any
offense,
including
whether
it
would
be
petty
larceny
or
jaywalking
or
shoplifting,
unless
you
decide
that
the
only
way
to
give
him
additional
punishment
is
to
put
him
to
death
for
jaywalking
or
shoplifting
or
petty
larceny.
justice
potter
stewart
does
this
not
leave
the
jury
at
large
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
any
rape,
depending
upon
their
own
reaction
to
the
evidence,
unguided
by
any
instructions
on
standards
of
the
kind
of
justice
that
probably
was
probing
at?
justice
potter
stewart
the
jury
has
to
find
at
least
one
or
more
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
in
order
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
georgia,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
rape
case
or
murder
case
or
any
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
this
case,
for
example,
an
aggravating
circumstance
would
be
a
previous
conviction
for
a
punitive
capital
felony.
so
that
would
be
an
aggravating
circumstance
even
if
the
rape
found
were
that
of
a
jilted
boyfriend
and
a
former
girlfriend,
people
who
were
not
strangers
but
who
knew
each
other.

of
the
petitioner’s
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
that
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
holding
that
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
to
sentence
somebody
to
death
for
the
commission
of
the
offense
of
rape
not
involving
a
homicide
would
have
broad
implications
because
it
would
be
understood
as
holding
that
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
for
any
non-homicidal
offense
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
what
other
non-homicidal
offenses
do
you
suggest
would
be
or
should
be
held
to
be
constitutionally
permissible
so
far
as
the
infliction
of
the
death
penalty
is
concerned?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
it
is
just
repeated
cases
of
assault
and
battery,
for
example?
justice

stewart
that
has
violence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
he
has
committed
murder
and
this
court
has
in
the
gregg
case
has
given
you
the
answer
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
would
certainly
deter
him.
generally,
deterrence
is
considered
with
a
somewhat
different
meaning
that
is
to
deter
others
because
of
the
example
you
make
of
him.
justice
potter
stewart
has
anybody
ever
been
sentenced
to
death
in
georgia
for
espionage
or
treason?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
legislative
policy,
the
legislative
policy
reflected
in
this
georgia
statute?
it
means
that
a
person
can
commit
murder
with
impunity
if
one
wants
to
put
it
that
way,
after
committing
a
rape,
an
assailant
could
think,
well
i
might
as
well
kill
the
victim
because
the
punishment
would
be
no
greater,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
not
mandatory
for
either,
is
it?
