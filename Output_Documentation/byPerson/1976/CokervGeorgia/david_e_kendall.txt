mr.
david
e.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
david
kendall
and
i
represent
petitioner
erlich
anthony
coker
who
has
been
condemned
by
the
state
of
georgia
to
be
electrocuted
for
the
crime
of
rape.
this
case
presents
for
review
a
question
explicitly
reserved
in
last
term’s
gregg
v.
georgia
decision:
whether
the
taking
of
a
criminal’s
life
is
a
proportionate
sanction
where
no
victim
has
been
deprived
of
life,
for
example,
when
capital
punishment
has
been
imposed
for
rape
that
does
not
result
in
the
death
of
any
human
being.
now,
on
september
2,
1974,
petitioner
coker
was
incarcerated
for
murder,
rape,
kidnapping
and
aggravated
assault
at
the
ware
correctional
institution
in
southern
georgia.
during
an
alcoholics
anonymous
meeting
he
was
attending
that
night,
a
group
of
prisoners
seized
two
guards
and
in
the
ensuing
disturbance,
petitioner
coker
escaped
through
the
roof
of
the
building
the
meeting
was
being
held
in.
at
about
11
pm
that
evening,
petitioner
appeared
at
the
home
of
allen
and
alita
carver
in
nearby
waycross,
georgia.
brandishing
a
board,
he
had
allan
carver
tied
up
in
the
bathroom
and
moved
the
carvers’
three-weeks
old
sleeping
baby
in
the
bassinette
into
the
bathroom
with
carver.
he
secured
a
kitchen
knife
with
a
four-inch
blade
and
took
$20.30
from
allan
carter’s
billfold
which
was
lying
on
a
dresser.
he
had
mrs.
carver
change
into
her
street
clothes
in
order
to
show
him
how
to
start
the
family
car.
after
she
had
undressed,
he
raped
her
and
then
clothed
himself
in
allan
carver’s
clothes.
during
the
rape,
the
knife
lay
on
a
nearby
dresser,
within
petitioner’s
reach.
he
told
allan
carver
that
he
was
taking
mrs.
carver
with
him
and
that
he
would
release
her
unharmed,
but
if
stopped
by
the
police,
he
would
kill
her.
after
they
left,
allan
carver
was
able
to
free
himself
and
call
the
police.
within
the
hour,
the
police
arrested
petitioner,
who
had
parked
with
mrs.
carver
on
a
dirt
road
to
evade
a
police
road
block.
mrs.
carver
was
released,
nervous,
shaken
but
physically
unharmed
apart
from
the
rape
itself.
a
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
petitioner
and
he
was
subsequently
indicted
for
rape,
armed
robbery,
kidnapping,
motor
vehicle
theft
and
escape.
a
special
plea
of
insanity
was
filed
which,
under
georgia
law,
sets
up
present
competence
to
be
tried
and
on
november
19th,
1974,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
finding
petitioner
competent.
now,
the
case
was
tried
on
all
five
counts
of
the
indictment
under
the
procedures
that
this
court
has
reviewed
in
gregg
v.
georgia.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
stage
of
the
trial,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
all
five
counts.
at
the
second
stage,
a
proceeding
was
then
held
to
determine
sentence
on
the
two
punitive
capital
counts
of
the
indictment,
the
rape
and
the
armed
robbery.
now,
at
this
point
the
state
introduced
evidence
of
petitioner’s
prior
capital
felony
convictions.
this
record
consisted
of
three
two-count
indictments
involving
crimes
against
two
victims.
with
one
philip
ecoles,
petitioner
had
been
convicted
in
the
clayton
county
superior
court
for
the
december
5th,
1971
murder
of
one
sue
ann
wick,
the
rape
and
murder
of
sue
ann
wick,
and
had
received
consecutive
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
and
twenty
years
imprisonment.
with
one
glen
harlen
stacey,
he
had
been
convicted
after
trial
in
the
richmond
county
superior
court
for
the
july
29,
1972
rape
and
kidnapping
of
one
susan
laureen
jones
and
for
these
crimes
he
received
consecutive
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
and
twenty
years
imprisonment.
finally,
petitioner
had
pleaded
guilty
in
the
tolliver
county
superior
court
to
another
july
29,
1972
rape
of
susan
laureen
jones
for
which
he
received
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
the
state
introduced
the
indictment
and
the
sentences
for
these
crimes
and
presented
witnesses
who
identified
petitioner
as
the
person
named
in
these
indictments
and
sentences,
but
details
of
these
prior
convictions
or
the
factual
circumstances
of
the
prior
convictions
were
not
adduced.
petitioner
presented
no
evidence.
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
as
to
the
rape
conviction,
it
could
find
two
aggravating
circumstances,
which
under
the
georgia
statute,
justify
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
the
court
instructed
that
the
jury
could
find
that
the
rape
was
committed
by
a
person
with
a
prior
capital
felony
conviction
and
it
instructed
that
the
jury
could
find
the
rape
committed
by
a
person
during
the
commission
of
another
capital
felony,
to
wit,
the
armed
robbery
of
$20.30
from
allan
carver.
now,
the
trial
court
did
not
define
particular
mitigating
circumstances
because
none
are
defined
in
the
statute,
but
it
did
instruct
that
in
litigation,
the
jury
could
recognize
anything
which
in
fairness
or
mercy
could
justify
extenuation
of
the
degree
of
punishment.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
the
evidence
of
petitioner’s
sanity,
insanity,
of
his
alcoholism
do
indeed
constitute
mitigating
circumstances.
those
have
been
presented
to
the
jury
at
the
first
stage
of
the
trial,
this
was
essentially
a
trifercated
trial.
there
was
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
sanity
which
preceded
the
trial
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
jury
found
both
aggravating
circumstances
to
exist
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
and
sentenced
petitioner
to
be
electrocuted
for
the
rape.
it
imposed
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
for
the
armed
robbery
conviction.
an
appeal
was
subsequently
taken
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
that
court,
with
one
justice
dissenting,
affirmed
petitioner’s
sentences
and
convictions.
a
certiorari
petition
was
subsequently
filed
in
this
court
and
on
october
4th
of
last
year,
the
court
granted
certiorari
limited
to
the
single
question
whether
the
death
penalty
may
be
constitutionally
exacted
for
a
rape
where
the
life
of
a
victim
is
not
taken.
while
the
court’s
decision
is
of
literally
vital
significance
to
erlich
coker,
it
will
not
have
much
of
an
impact
on
the
criminal
justice
system,
whichever
way
the
court
decides
this
case
because
the
death
penalty
for
non-homicide
crimes
has
been
almost
totally
repudiated
by
this
society,
in
fact.
of
the
345
people
who
are
now
on
death
row
in
this
country,
six
are
on
death
row
for
non-homicide
crimes
or
crimes
that
do
not
involve
the
death
of
the
victim.
georgia
is
the
only
american
state
and
virtually
the
only
jurisdiction
in
the
civilized
world
that
now
authorizes
the
death
penalty
for
the
rape
of
an
adult
woman.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
for
kidnapping,
when
the
victim
is
harmed
or
ransom
secured,
it
authorizes
the
death
penalty
for
six
capital
offenses
after
gregg.
it
also
authorizes
the
death
penalty
for
treason,
for
murder
and
for
aircraft
hijacking.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
four,
because
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
the
gregg
case
held
that
the
death
penalty
could
not
be
constitutionally
imposed
for
armed
robbery.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
despite
the
statute,
it
was
a
statutory
holding,
it
was
not
a
constitutional
holding.
indeed,
after
furman
v.
georgia,
the
states
enacted
16
non-homicide
death
penalties.
georgia
enacted
five
of
those.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
in
the
georgia
constitution,
but
that
clause
was
not
relied
on
in
the
gregg
case.
there
is
a
provision
for
review
of
a
sentence
that
is
disproportionate
or
excessive
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
held
that
a
death
penalty
for
armed
robbery
was
such
an
illegal
sentence.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
yes,
yes
it
was.
the
court
has
vacated
since
that
time
two
other
death
sentences
for
armed
robbery.
in
each
case
an
armed
robbery
death
sentence
has
been
imposed,
it
has
been
imposed
with
a
murder
death
sentence,
so
just
one
death
sentence
was
vacated
of
each
defendant.
even
in
georgia,
only
a
small
arbitrarily
selected
fraction
of
eligible
defendants
are
condemned
for
rape.
finally,
the
death
penalty
for
rape
comes
to
this
court
with
a
notorious
and
unsavory
reputation
for
racial
discrimination.
now,
petitioner
coker
is
white
and
the
court
did
not
grant
an
equal
protection
claim
in
this
case,
but
part
of
our
eighth
amendment
submission
on
behalf
of
petitioner
coker
is
that
the
origin
of
the
death
penalty
for
rape
and
such
continuing
acceptance
as
it
demonstrates
is
really
founded
in
invidious
racial
discrimination.
ninety
percent
of
the
people
executed
for
this
crime,
the
455
people
executed
for
this
crime
since
1930,
have
been
black.
in
georgia
itself
in
this
period,
58
blacks
have
been
executed
and
three
whites
have
been
executed.
now,
our
submission
on
behalf
of
petitioner
coker
is
essentially
two-fold.
first,
that
the
death
penalty
for
rape
constitutes
an
excessive
and
disproportionate
punishment
for
a
crime
where
the
life
of
the
victim
has
not
been
taken
when
judged
by
relevant
contemporary
standards
and
second,
quite
apart
from
this
first
claim,
that
the
present
pattern
of
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
for
rape
in
georgia
shows
the
same
arbitrariness,
infrequency
and
capriciousness
of
application
that
this
court
held
violated
the
eighth
amendment
in
furman
v.
georgia.
now,
that
punishment
should
somehow
be
proportioned
to
the
offense
was
first
recognized
by
this
court
in
weems
v.
united
states.
it
was
again
recognized
in
last
july’s
capital
punishment
decisions.
in
those
cases,
the
court
held
that
the
death
penalty
for
homicides
intentionally
committed
by
a
defendant
did
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment,
was
not
a
disproportionate
sanction,
but
the
court
reserved
the
constitutionality
of
a
death
penalty
where
the
life
of
the
victim
was
not
taken.
now,
certainly
rape
is
a
serious
offense
like
aggravated
assault,
maim,
child
torture,
aggravated
sodomy
or
attempted
murder.
the
question
here,
however,
is
whether
rape
will
be
punished
by
the
ultimate
penalty
that
the
criminal
justice
system
can
dispense.
in
woodson,
the
plurality
recognized
that
the
death
penalty
is
different
in
kind
from
a
sentence
of
imprisonment,
however
long.
it
said
that
death
is
qualitatively
different
from
imprisonment.
last
tuesday,
the
plurality
in
gardner
v.
florida
stated
that
the
death
penalty
is
different
from
imprisonment
in
both
severity
and
finality,
that
it
differs
dramatically
from
any
other
legitimate
state
action
and
the
question
posed
here
is
not
whether
rape
will
be
stringently
punished.
indeed,
georgia
authorizes
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment
for
rape.
the
question
is
really
whether
it
could
be
punished
by
the
unique
and
irreversible
punishment
of
death.
now
in
the
gregg
plurality
opinion,
the
court
stated
that
in
applying
the
proportionality
test,
the
court
would
not
look
to
subjective
standards,
but
would
instead
look
to
what
it
called
objective
indicia
of
contemporary
attitudes
towards
a
given
sanction.
it
recognized
three
of
these
objective
indicia:
legislative
enactments,
jury
verdicts
and
what
the
court
called
history
and
traditional
usage.
we
submit
by
the
unanimous
concurrence
of
these
indicators,
the
death
penalty
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
today.
now,
as
far
as
legislative
enactments
go,
as
i
have
mentioned,
georgia
code
annotated
26-2001
is
literally
unique
in
the
united
states.
no
other
american
jurisdiction
now
authorizes
the
death
penalty
for
the
rape
of
an
adult
woman.
in
1926,
there
were
20
united
states
jurisdictions
that
authorized
a
discretionary
death
penalty
for
the
rape
of
an
adult
woman.
even
before
this
court’s
decision
in
furman
v.
georgia,
there
was
a
trend
toward
abolition.
delaware
abolished
the
penalty
in
1958.
west
virginia
abolished
it
in
1965.
the
district
of
columbia
abolished
it
in
1970.
on
the
eve
of
furman,
therefore,
17
states
had
a
discretionary
death
penalty
for
the
rape
of
an
adult
woman.
the
11
states
of
the
confederacy,
four
border
states;
kentucky,
maryland,
missouri,
oklahoma,
plus
nevada
where
there
was
severe
bodily
injury
and
the
united
states.
now,
furman
wiped
these
statutes
off
the
books
because
all
were
discretionary.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
i
submit
that
the
court’s
furman
decision
does
reflect
the
desuetude
into
which
the
death
penalty
had
fallen
in
many
cases,
both
murder
and
rape.
we
really,
as
an
indicator
of
contemporary
standards,
rely
on
the
legislative
reaction
to
furman,
and
to
gregg
for
that
matter
because
when
the
legislatures
had
to
take
another
look
at
the
crime
of
rape,
only
six
states
enacted
any
kind
of
death
penalty
for
a
rape
offense
after
furman.
now,
three
of
these
states;
tennessee,
florida
and
mississippi
enacted
a
death
penalty
for
the
rape
of
a
child
under
12
or
in
the
case
of
florida,
under
11.
north
carolina
and
louisiana
enacted
a
very
narrow
death
penalty,
mandatory
death
penalty
for
the
rape
of
an
adult
woman
where
there
was
serious
bodily
injury
or
where
a
weapon
was
used.
only
georgia
enacted
a
death
penalty
that
would
punish
any
rape
of
an
adult
woman
with
death.
so
we
think
that
the
reaction
to
furman
does
manifest
that
legislative
repudiation
and
indeed,
there
is
a
further
reaction
because,
since
gregg,
this
court’s
decisions
in
roberts
and
woodson
had
the
effect
of
invalidating
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes.
so
that
invalidated
tennessee’s
death
penalty
statute,
louisiana’s,
north
carolina’s
and
mississippi’s.
now,
if
you
look
at
--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
i
think
probably
with
those
states,
it
is
too
short
to
be
sure,
but
we
do
know
that
for
example,
louisiana
has
enacted
within
a
month
of
this
court’s
roberts
decision,
enacted
a
death
penalty
for
homicide,
for
certain
kinds
of
homicide.
it
defeated
a
death
penalty
for
aggravated
rape.
so
i
think
that
louisiana,
we
can
check
off.
tennessee,
the
only
other
legislative
activity
that
i
am
aware
of
is
in
the
state
of
tennessee
where
a
death
penalty
for
homicide
has
cleared
the
judiciary
committees
of
both
houses
and
the
death
penalty
for
rape
bills
have
been
defeated
within
those
committees.
so
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
is
enough
time
since
gregg
to
fully
assess
it,
but
we
do
know
that
there
have
been
four
death
penalties
for
homicide
statutes
passed
since
gregg.
none
of
those
states
have
enacted
a
death
penalty
for
rape
and
there
are
three
other
states
which
we
note
in
our
reply
brief
where
both
houses
of
the
legislature
have
enacted
a
death
penalty
bill
for
homicide
and
those
are
awaiting
the
governor’s
signature
in
maryland,
new
jersey
and
virginia
and
the
houses
of
legislature
have
not
enacted
a
death
penalty
for
rape.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice,
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that
that
was
the
only
reason
for
its
unconstitutionality
in
this
case.
what
i
did
mean
to
suggest
was
that
it
was
a
reason
for
applying
an
exceptionally
high
standard
of
review
and
justification
and
i
think
the
death
penalty
is
different
in
one
respect
because
it
is
irreversible.
i
think
that
means
that
this
higher
standard
of
review
has
to
be
applied
to
the
justifications
advanced
by
the
state
and
also
to
the
consideration
whether
a
particular
death
penalty
for
a
non-homicide
offense
is
consonant
with
contemporary
values.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
yes,
we
do.
we
think
that
in
one
sense,
the
execution
of
petitioner
coker
or
ebrahart
or
hooks
or
anybody
else
on
death
row
for
rape,
would
be
error
not
in
the
sense
i
think
error
is
usually
meant,
but
in
the
sense
that
it
is
an
erroneous
execution
because
society
has
broadly
repudiated
it.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
there
are
certainly
other
collateral
claims
presented
in
this
case,
which
the
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
the
basis
of
that
would
be
pursued
in
collateral
proceedings
which
might
demonstrate
that
because
of
insanity
or
some
other
reason,
this
death
penalty
was
erroneous.
so
in
that
sense,
we
do
have
that
claim
of
factual
error
in
this
case.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
case
presented
here.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
imprisonment
would
be
an
appropriate
punishment
when
judged
by
what
society
does
to
essentially
all
other
people
who
are
convicted
of
that
crime.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
certainly,
he
would
have
the
stigma
of
another
rape
conviction.
society
would
be
protected
since
it
would
have
kept
him
incarcerated.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
yes,
mr.
justice
powell,
that
is
--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
that
is
correct.
of
course,
petitioner
coker
was
incarcerated
--
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
we
think
that
the
objective
indicators
that
the
court
pointed
to
in
gregg
would
indicate
that
society,
where
a
life
has
not
been
taken,
the
death
penalty
is
inappropriate
to
protect
a
value
other
than
life.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
i
think
that
the
deterrence
connotes
protection
from
society
it
seems
to
me
in
that
case.
i
think
that
certainly
if
there
is
a
life
without
parole
statute,
adding
a
sentence
would
not
in
and
of
itself
impose
more
punishment.
but
insofar
as
deterrence
is
a
question
that
relates
to
the
general
public,
i
think
the
usual
safeguards
that
can
be
applied
to
prevent
escapes
would
adequately
protect
the
public,
because
it
is
interesting
that
in
both
the
coker
and
the
coley
case,
which
are
two,
the
coley
case
is
very
similar
to
this
case
in
many
ways.
these
were
prisoners
who
escaped
from
a
correctional
facility
and
committed
rape.
neither
of
those
prisoners
was
incarcerated
in
a
maximum
security
facility.
the
state
of
georgia
can
take
more
steps
than
it
has
taken
in
these
cases
to
protect
society.
also,
the
state
of
georgia
can
enact,
as
it
has
not
yet
enacted,
some
longer
term
of
mandatory
imprisonment
for
repeated
crimes,
whatever
those
crimes
are.
in
georgia,
under
georgia
code
annotated
77-525,
a
prisoner
comes
up
for
parole
in
seven
years,
regardless
of
what
his
sentence
is.
now,
georgia
could
extend
that
time,
if
it
wished
to
do
so.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
this
case
was
really
not
tried
on
a
recidivism
theory.
the
jury
was
not
instructed
that
coker’s
repeated
crimes
could
justify
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
he
had
capital
felonies
other
than
rape.
the
georgia
supreme
court
did
not
review
it
on
a
recidivist
theory.
in
fact,
its
proportionality
review
consisted
entirely
in
the
statement
that
the
death
penalty
here
is
not
excessive
or
disproportionate.
as
we
point
out,
in
comparison
to
the
coley
case,
although
coley
was
an
armed
robbery
recidivist,
the
two
factual
circumstances
are
almost
identical.
in
fact
if
anything,
the
coley
case
is
a
little
more
aggravated
on
the
facts.
but
many
states
have
opposed
or
many
groups
have
opposed
life
without
parole
statutes
because
it
deprives
the
corrections
authority
of
all
control
over
inmates
who
hope
at
some
point
to
be
paroled.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
well,
the
only
study
i
know
of
is
a
study
by
professor
bailey
that
appears
in
the
1976
book,
capital
punishment
in
the
united
states,
he
did
a
regression
analysis
which
indicated
that
(a)
rape
rates
in
abolition
states
were
lower
than
in
retentionist
states
and
also
that
the
death
penalty,
its
execution
in
retentionist
states
bore
no
inverse
relation
to
the
rape
rates.
that
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
deterrent
effect
of
the
death
penalty,
but
bailey
also
i
think
in
fairness,
observed
that
the
death
penalty
was
simply
too
sporadically
imposed
to
really
run
a
good
regression
analysis.
it
is
very
seldom
imposed.
it
also
constituted
no
threat,
he
said,
to
the
white
rapist.
so,
he
did
no
really
say
that
his
study
was
at
all
conclusive,
but
the
data
is
so
bad
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
conclusory
study.
so
i
mentioned
that
petitioner
with
messrs,
hooks,
ebrahart,
shue,
hughs
and
boyer
are
the
members
of
an
exclusive,
but
hapless
fraternity.
they
are
the
only
people
now
on
death
row.
there
are
a
couple
of
ways
to
measure
their
uniqueness.
first
of
all,
the
uniform
crime
reports
indicate
that
about
1200
forcible
rapes
occur
every
year
in
georgia.
that
would
be
about
4800
rape
offenses
committed
under
the
new
statute.
the
other
thing,
as
we
point
in
our
brief
and
reply
brief,
is
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
reviewed
59
cases
in
which
life
or
less
has
been
imposed
as
a
punishment
for
a
crime.
not
all
rape
convictions
certainly
were
appealed
to
the
georgia
supreme
court,
but
we
do
know
that
at
least
59
non-capital
rapes
have
been
reviewed.
i
think
i
have
said
enough
to
indicate
what
our
furman
submission
is.
it
is
simply
that
without
reaching
the
question
whether
the
death
penalty
is
disproportionate
for
the
crime
of
rape,
the
pattern
of
imposition
here
is
precisely
that
observed
in
furman.
the
death
penalty
is
an
extraordinarily
rare
punishment
for
the
crime
of
rape.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
points.
the
need
to
protect
society
really
has
more
than
one
facet
and
i
commend
to
the
court’s
attention
the
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
by
a
number
of
women’s
rights
organizations.
they
make
the
point
that,
for
their
constituents,
the
death
penalty
for
rape
is
counter-productive.
it
discourages
prosecutions,
may
lead
to
jury
nullification
and
gives
the
criminal
in
a
state
where
homicide
is
punishable
by
death
an
incentive
to
kill
the
victim.
so
as
far
as
they
are
concerned,
i
do
not
think
anybody
can
tax
them
with
insensitivity
to
rape
victims,
the
death
penalty
for
rape
is
counter-productive.
now,
the
second
thing
that
i
would
like
to
say
is
about
the
use
of
the
death
penalty
for
other
crimes.
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
in
the
four
years
since
furman,
nobody
has
been
condemned
to
die
for
some
non-homicide
and
only
six
people
have
been
condemned
to
die
for
rape.
i
think
this
underlines
the
wisdom
of
the
court’s
traditional
(inaudible)
the
principles
in
not
confronting
this
case
until
it
has
to.
a
decision
in
the
rape
case
will
not
necessarily
decide
those
cases
and
those
cases
may
simply
be
moot
because
the
death
sentences
under
these
other
crimes
may
never
come
to
the
court.
as
far
as
the
racial
history
of
the
death
penalty
in
georgia
goes,
i
think
it
is
interesting
that
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
there
is
not
one
syllable
of
exculpation
of
the
history
of
the
death
penalty
for
rape
in
georgia.
we
have
set
forth
the
legislative
history.
it
appears
to
be
designed
after
the
civil
war
to
punish
black
defendants
who
commit
the
crime
of
rape
against
white
victims.
that
is
what
observers
have
concluded
and
that
is
what
statistics
seem
to
show.
so
this
penalty
does
not
come
to
this
court
with
a
even-handed
history
of
application.
i
have
mentioned
that
the
case
was
not
tried
on
a
recidivist
theory.
what
i
meant
by
that
was
that
the
jury
was
not
instructed
in
any
way
as
to
coker’s
future
dangerousness.
now,
we
have
attacked
this
statute
on
its
face,
but
we
also
feel
that
even
if
there
are
some
rapes
which
may
be
capitally
punished,
this
statute
does
not
draw
a
defensible
line.
it
may
be
that
there
is
some
kind
of
dangerousness
test
or
harm
to
the
victim
test.
this
case
was
not
tried
on
that.
it
also
was
not
tried
on
a
theory
of
what
a
petitioner
was
likely
to
do
in
the
future.
mr.
david
e.
kendall
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall
they
were,
but
they
were
charged
on
the
capital
felonies
of
armed
robbery,
murder
and
rape.
they
were
charged
on
the
petitioner’s
past
record,
but
insofar
as
he
constituted
a
threat
in
the
future,
there
was
nothing
like
the
texas
capital
punishment
statute’s
instruction
to
the
jury
to
consider
future
harm.
finally,
the
point
about
the
lex
stallones;
this
has
always
been
a
principle,
a
harsh
retributive
principle,
but
historically
it
has
been
used
to
limit
the
punishment
and
we
submit
that
part
of
the
reason
for
the
repudiation
of
the
death
penalty
may
be
simply
a
popular
perception
that,
where
life
is
not
taken,
life
should
not
be
forfeited.
thank
you
very
much.
