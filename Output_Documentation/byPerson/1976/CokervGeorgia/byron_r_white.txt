justice
byron
r.
white
in
gregg
against
georgia,
this
court
held
that
a
death
penalty
was
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
amendment
when
imposed
for
the
crime
of
murder.
the
question
on
this
case
concerns
the
death
penalty
for
rape.
ehrlich
anthony
coker
escaped
from
a
georgia
prison
while
serving
long
sentences
for
murder,
rape
and
kidnapping.
he
then
committed
additional
crimes,
among
them,
rape
and
armed
robbery.
he
was
convicted
of
both
of
those
crimes
and
sentenced
to
death
for
rape.
the
death
sentence
was
imposed
in
accordance
with
those
procedures
which
the
court
upheld
in
the
gregg
case,
and
only
after
a
finding
by
the
jury
that
the
rape
is
committed
in
--
with
aggravating
circumstances,
namely
that
coker
had
been
previously
convicted
of
a
capital
crime
and
that
the
rape
was
convicted
while
committing
still
another
capital
crime,
namely
armed
robbery.
coker's
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
that
court
rejecting
his
claim
that
the
death
penalty
was
unconstitutional.
we
reverse
that
judgment
in
so
far
as
it
imposes
the
death
penalty.
seven
justices
have
concluded
that
the
death
penalty
imposed
in
this
case
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
the
eighth
amendment.
there
is
no
single
opinion
for
the
court
supporting
that
judgment.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
which
is
joined
by
my
brothers,
stewart,
blackmun
and
stevens,
explaining
while
--
why
we
think
that
the
death
penalty
is
disproportionate
and
hence,
unconstitutionally
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
for
rape
under
any
circumstances.
justices
brennan
and
marshall
concurring
the
judgment
since
as
they
have
said
before
they
have
concluded
that
capital
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
any
circumstances
for
any
crime.
mr.
justice
powell
also
concurs
in
the
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
the
death
penalty
is
cruel
and
unusual
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
although
it
might
not
be
in
other
instances
of
rape.
mr.
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
joined.
