rehnquist
you
--
you
then
state,
what
do
you
mean,
the
three-mile
inward?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
suppose
that
after
the
tidelands
act,
the
submerged
lands
act,
congress
could
come
along
and
say,
“we're
--
we're
exercising
our
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
license
people
to
drill
for
oil
within
the
three-mile
limit?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
oil
stands
on
any
different
footing
than
shellfish
within
those
three-mile
limits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
shellfish
matter
doesn't
cover
all
fisheries?
do
you
think
the
submerged
lands
act
reach
fishery
--
fisheries
generally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
one
of
the
states
of
the
union
entitled
to
claim
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause?
is
there
a
holding
at
this
point
on
that
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
that
that
issue
isn't
raise
here,
is
it
the
p&i
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
your
lawyer
call
on
new
jersey
attorney
general
the
same
way
your
clients
or
your
opponents,
lawyers
called
under
virginia
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
loflin,
do
both
enrollment
and
licensing
come
up
under
the
same
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
1793
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
old
one
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no
one
is
contending
you
didn't
comply
with
the
federal
statute,
are
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
your
half
hour.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
loflin,
if
congress
had
passed
the
statute
authorizing
it,
do
you
think
you
could
be
licensed
by
a
federal
authority
to
drill
for
oil
within
the
three-mile
limits
of
virginia
without
virginia's
permission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
withstanding
the
submerged
lands
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
unless
there's
any
conflict
between
the
1953
submerged
lands
act
and
the
1793
act
you're
relying
on,
i
suppose
the
later
statute
would
take
precedence.
