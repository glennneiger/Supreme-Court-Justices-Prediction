justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
--
you
mean
the
statute
place
any
limitation
on
the
disposal
of
the
--
of
the
catch?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
sell
them
anywhere
they
want.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
--
well
then
--
as
--
as
suppose
--
as
suppose
that
--
that
the
united
states
have
--
would
have
power
to
--
to
control
this
matter
and
what
do
you
say
the
--
the
licensing
--
the
federal
license
entitled
these
vessels
to
do
if
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i'm
just
asking
you,
what
did
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
this
particular
license
--
this
particular
license
was
issued
under
statute
which
said
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
if
it's
a
licensed
--
is
--
is
this
a
correct
statement
or
the
correct
quote,
appellees'
vessels
have
been
enrolled
and
licensed
and
are
therefore,
“deemed
vessels
of
the
united
states,
entitled
to
the
privileges
of
vessels
employed
in
the
coasting
trade
or
fisheries.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
--
that
isn't
the
federal
license
for
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
let's
assume
we
disagree
with
you
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
is
--
would
you
--
would
you
say
that
--
would
you
sat
that
this
statute
on
its
phase
purports
to
give
a
license
to
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
talking
the
commerce
clause
so
now,
i'm
talking
about
what
does
statute
on
this
phase
purports
to
do?
does
it
purport
to
--
whether
--
whether
the
government
(voice
overlap)
to
do
it
or
not,
does
the
statute
purport
to
or
seem
to
give
a
right
to
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
natural
resources
in
the
--
in
the
seabed?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
granted
ownership
with
the
waters?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
moore
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
there
anything
on
the
record
to
indicate
that
virginia
does
reserve
the
menhaden
for
virginia
residence?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
does
that
a
--
a
canada
resident
after
he
gets
a
catch
ship
to
menhaden
to
new
york
or
some
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
any
different
if
it
were
reserving
the
privilege
of
being
an
architect,
say,
to
residence
or
privilege
to
the
mining
coal
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
purpose
then
is
not
to
preserve
the
menhaden
but
to
pre
--
preserve
the
laborer
and
the
employment
opportunities.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
a
state
provide
that
nobody
but
resident
show
--
pick
certain
agricultural
products?
sometimes
in
some
states
you
know,
they
have
workers
who
come
in
temporarily
and
do
the
picking
and
then
leave.
could
they
be
prohibited
from
--
well
could
they
be
limited
to
residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
of
course
the
domestication
long
preceded
the
foreign
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
--
i
take
it
on
your
position
if
foreign-controlled,
domestic-controlled
or
about
even
made
a
balance
--
the
balance,
they
transfer
of
the
few
shares
would
change
the
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
do
if
it
were
precisely
50%
foreign-controlled
and
50%
domestic?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
suppose
it's
75%
and
25%
and
under
the
statute,
the
75%
would
--
would
meet
it.
justice
byron
r.
white

the
name
used

in
new
jersey.
justice
byron

that's
the
name,
i
knew
it
was.
