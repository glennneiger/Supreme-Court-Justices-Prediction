mr.
moore,
i
want
to
be
sure
of
one
thing.
has
seacoast
never
fished
at
chesapeake
bay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
--
to
your
knowledge,
have
they
ever
complained
about
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
until
the
new
legislations
come
along
and
now
--
and
now
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
moore,
i
noticed
that
you
have
a
string
of
amicus
briefs
from
the
atlantic
coast
states
supporting
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
new
jersey
is
absent,
is
there
--
do
i
imply
anything
from
that
absence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
loflin,
can
i
interrupt
to
get
one
historical
matter
straight
in
my
mind?
as
i
understand
it,
the
nonresident
statute
has
been
on
the
book
for
some
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
one
of
the
two
statutes
that
prevents
you
from
fishing
both
in
chesapeake
bay
and
on
the
inland
--
on
the
--
in
the
within
three-mile
--
on
the
--
on
the
ocean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
resident
statute
has
no
application
to
waters
--
to
the
ocean
waters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
alright.
that
answers
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
language
of
the
statute
is,
the
waters
of
the
commonwealth
or
the
waters
under
its
joint
jurisdiction
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
included
the
ocean
waters
which
you
said
does
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
--
the
thing
that
is
puzzling
me
is
why
this
litigation
got
started
if
they
just
passed
a
new
citizenship
requirement
applied
only
that
wouldn't
have
affected
you
if
you're
--
but
you're
already
barred
because
you
did
--
you
couldn't
go
under
the
--
in
to
the
chesapeake
even
before
the
new
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
and
the
fact
that
the
non-citizen
--
the
citizenship
requirement
affects
the
marginal
waters
that's
why
you
were
suddenly
--
your
--
your
business
situation
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
wouldn't
have
been
out
of
the
entire
virginia
area
if
that
statute
applied
to
the
ocean
waters
but
it
doesn't.
i
understand
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
that
no
state
can
go
behind
that
and
make
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
of
your
ownership
once
you
have
the
flag.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
shouldn't
the
federal
statutes
referring
to
a
fishery
or
why
shouldn't
the
federal
license
be
understood
the
meaning
of
license
just
to
fish
outside
the
three-mile
limit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
gibbons
was
just
a
discrimination
against
commerce
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
why
--
why
don't
you
argue
then
that
the
united
states
could
--
could
under
his
license
permit
these
ships
to
go
into
chesapeake
bay
even
if
virginia
said,
“nobody
may
fish
with
--
or
menhaden
in
chesapeake
bay.”
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
want
to
press
gibbons
against
ogden.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
--
as
a
discrimination
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
moore,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
construction
over
the
residency
statute
section
60
applying
only
to
--
to
in
--
inland
waters
and
not
to
coastal
waters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
