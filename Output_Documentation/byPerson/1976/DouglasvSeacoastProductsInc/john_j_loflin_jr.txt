mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
appellee
and
its
subsidiaries
of
seacoast
products
and
the
two
other
subsidiary
corporations
which
as
the
court
may
know,
our
domestic
corporations
controlled
ultimately
by
a
corporation
of
the
united
kingdom
which
is
itself
publicly
held.
much
was
made
in
the
reply
brief
filed
here
that
because
control
of
seacoast
unquestionably
does
rest
in
the
hands
of
a
foreign
corporation
owned
by
foreigners
at
least
in
large
part
that
somehow
that
arrangement
alone
deprived
us
for
any
claim
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
i
think
the
claim
is
spurious
but
i
would
like
to
know
for
the
court
that
as
stated
in
our
brief,
hanson
trust
is
a
publicly
held
corporation
and
in
fact
some
u.s.
citizens
own
its
stock.
i
do
not
suggest
that
they
--
there
are
enough
few
u.s.
citizens
to
meet
the
test
just
outlined
by
my
friend
as
stated
in
the
virginia
statute.
i
am
not
here
contending
we
have
75%
in
the
hand
of
americans,
but
i
just
wanted
the
court
to
know
that
if
this
is
an
issue,
there
are
some
americans
who
have
invested
in
this
company
whose
rights
in
economic
benefits
would
be
affected
by
any
detriment
to
seacoast
and
in
turn
its
parent
company.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
think
not
--
i
think
not
one
bit,
your
honor.
i
think
under
the
basis
on
which
corporations
are
permitted
to
function
in
the
states
and
under
--
in
this
case,
under
certain
aspects
for
a
tightly
controlled
aspects
of
federal
law,
it
would
be
most
improper
and
baseless
to
say,
“well,
we
have
one
kind
of
corporation
which
has
certain
benefits
and
privileges
under
the
u.s.
constitution.
we
have
other
types
of
competing
corporations
engaged
in
the
same
line
of
business
following
all
the
same
laws
that
have
these
disabilities,
that
--
that
to
me
has
known
foundation
in
our
tradition
or
in
our
law.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
they
would
be
if,
your
honor
will
bear
in
mind
that
to
get
where
we
are,
we
had
to
undergo
the
scrutiny
of
the
federal
government
and
that
scrutiny
has
input
from
various
interested
bodies
of
the
government
including
state,
fisheries,
maritime,
noaa,
and
as
mr.
moore
pointed
out,
there
are
defense
concepts
that
are
built
into
these
licensing
and
enrollment
provision.
so,
whether
saudi
arabia
would
be
approved
or
not,
i
do
not
know,
but
if
it
were,
then
yes,
my
position
would
be
the
same.
i
would
like
to
outline
briefly
the
nature
of
the
fishery
that
we're
talking
about,
discuss
the
enrollment
and
licensing
provisions
which
are
critical
here,
the
effect
on
--
i
consider
our
foreign
policy
and
then
deal
in
some
detail
in
the
two
statutes.
we're
here
talking
about
competing
companies
engaged
in
the
menhaden
fishery.
they're
basically
three
companies
that
are
somewhat
similar
in
its
basic
setup
to
the
automobile
industry
in
this
country.
by
that
analogy
which
is
fairly
close,
our
principal
competitor,
zapata
haynie,
is
the
general
motors
of
the
menhaden
trade.
our
client
would
come
in
at
the
ford
level
and
standard
products
would
come
in
at
the
chrysler
level.
but
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
menhaden
fishery
really
is
run
by
these
three
large
corporations
and
we
compete
against
each
other
all
up
and
down
the
east
coast
and
in
the
gulf
coast
states.
with
--
with
that
background,
i
think
you
can
better
understand
the
motivation
that
really
was
operative
in
the
virginia
legislature
when
the
two
virginia-based
corporations
that
is
zapata
haynie
and
standard
products
saw
that
there
was
an
opportunity
because
of
a
change
in
ownership
of
my
client's
company
to
get
the
virginia
legislature
to
put
through
a
restrictive
statute.
zapata
haynie
in
particular
sponsored
that
statute
sent
its
lawyer
and
to
testify
about
it,
talked
about
the
threatened
--
the
russian
invasion
of
the
chesapeake
bay
and
in
that
context
under
emergency
conditions,
the
statute
is
saying,
“you
must
be
a
citizen
corporation
or
owned
by
citizens”
was
put
through.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
the
record
shows
that
seacoast
through
the
years
goes
back
to
1911
fishing
on
the
east
coast
and
in
virginia
waters,
at
one
time,
it
had
a
virginia
sub
--
subsidiary
which
qualified
as
a
resident
so
that
it
could
fish
in
the
chesapeake
bay.
i
can't
tell
you
the
exact
number
of
years.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it
was
back
some
time,
but
i
believe
within
the
last
15
years.
but
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
there
are
two
fisheries
we're
talking
about.
we
haven't
been
fishing
all
along
in
the
chesapeake.
we
have
been
fishing
all
along
--
along
the
east
coast,
that
is
the
--
the
ocean
waters
running
all
the
way
up
to
cape
cod
and
down
through
carolina
and
in
fact
in
the
gulf
states.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
if
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
perhaps
i
was
misunderstood.
as
to
the
chesapeake
only,
that
aspect
of
it
has
for
many,
many
years
i
think
since
the
latter
part
of
the
19th
century
been
restricted
to
virginia
residents
in
order
to
fish
in
the
chesapeake
and
we
did
fish
in
the
chesapeake
for
a
time.
we
had
to
set
up
a
virginia
resident
corporation
which
we
did
and
we
had
a
plan
in
virginia
at
one
time.
but
at
all
of
the
time
that
i
am
talking
about
which
goes
back
for
many,
many
years,
the
vessels
of
seacoast
wondered
as
the
menhaden
do
from
state
to
state
in
the
offshore
waters
but
within
the
three-mile
limit.
it
is
in
the
nature
of
menhaden
to
come
into
these
inshore
waters
in
the
spring
and
summer.
they
generally
come
into
the
more
southern
states
first
and
gradually
migrate
toward
the
north
up
toward
cape
cod.
it
is
their
characteristic
and
this
makes
some
--
makes
the
fishery
commercially
viable.
it
is
their
characteristic
to
school
up
in
massive
schools
only
in
this
summer
migratory
pass
and
only
in
inshore
waters.
practically
all
of
the
menhaden
that
is
captured
for
commercial
purposes
is
taken
in
closed
shore.
now,
that
takes
care
of
the
outlying
shore
--
shore
areas
but
they
are
important
interior
base
and
river
estuaries.
now
for
example,
we've
mentioned
the
chesapeake
but
the
delaware
river
is
important
so
as
long
island
sounds,
so
as
narragansett
bay
and
the
waters
around
cape
cod.
these
are
all
waters
where
the
menhaden
move
on
their
travels.
it
is
their
nature
to
spawn
in
the
open
ocean,
drift
in
towards
shore
when
there
are
very
tiny,
almost
little
particles
and
then
grow
in
the
estuarine
waters
of
virginia,
north
carolina,
delaware,
the
other
shore
states.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
up
to
about
14
to
15
inches.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
and
some
of
them
will
live
as
long
as
7
to
10
years
although
that's
a
bit
unusual.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
we've
added
no
real
limit
to
the
fact
--
to
the
contrary,
we
hope
they
thrive
to
prosper,
multiply
and
we'd
continue
to
have
a
fishery
to
work
on,
but
we
make
out
living
capturing
menhaden,
yes.
the
fishery
in
the
chesapeake
bay
tends
to
be
more
of
the
younger
fish
since
that
is
in
effect
a
nursery
and
the
record
shows
that
one
and
two-year-old
menhaden
are
characteristic
of
the
fish
caught
in
that
area.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that
would
be
about
right.
also,
it
should
be
noted
i
think
that
the
entire
fishery
depends
on
their
survival
of
a
certain
amount
of
this
fish
to
the
three-year
old
ranch
because
that's
when
the
females
spawn
for
the
first
time.
they
will
spawn
at
age
three
and
thereafter
but
not
until.
our
company
grew
up
as
a
domestic
company.
i
say
our
company
--
i
think
it's
been
noted
here
that
is
no
--
no
brief
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
for
example.
well
monmouth,
new
jersey,
port
monmouth,
new
jersey
is
our
headquarters
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
not
found
our
presence
there
objectionable
in
any
event
they
have
not
filed
a
brief
against
us
here.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
didn't.
in
any
event,
i
would
like
now
to
address
myself
just
--
just
to
note
on
the
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
the
smith
mill
company
was
one
of
the
names
used
in
new
jersey.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
was
known
by
that
name
in
virginia
one
time
also.
but
smith
mill
is
probably
the
name
that
--
probably
the
older
residence
of
the
port
monmouth
area
would
associate
with,
but
seacoast
is
the
parent
corporation
of
smith
mill
and
oceanic.
this
company
has
been
described
in
the
same
company
as
foreign
predators
somehow
ravaging
the
fishery
and
--
and
then
disappearing
to
go
ravage
some
other
fishery.
characteristics
attributed
to
us
seemed
rather
strange
and
i
think
totally
inappropriate.
we
have
exactly
the
same
interest
in
conserving
this
resource
as
our
competitors
do.
we
have
an
enormous
investment
in
american
documented
vessels.
we
have
shore
side
facilities
in
new
york,
new
jersey,
delaware,
texas,
louisiana
and
our
competitors
as
noted
in
the
brief
are
similarly
situated.
we
are
located
where
the
fish
are.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
we
all
know
that
this
business
which
is
basically
a
very
sound
business
will
be
absolutely
ruined
if
enough
of
the
fish
are
not
left
to
replenish
the
supply
and
keep
it
regular.
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
record
and
for
that
matter
in
the
briefs
characterized
the
menhaden
as
an
endangered
species.
we're
characterized
as
a
predator
company
simply
because
apparently,
we
are
now
owned
by
a
british
parent.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
the
resident
statute
strictly
speaking
just
applies
to
the
chesapeake
bay.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
the
other
statute,
the
alienage
or
citizenship
statute
applies
to
virginia
waters
wherever.
in
other
words,
the
ocean
and
the
chesapeake
bay,
but
the
residency
statute
which
goes
back
i
believe
the
1890s
just
applies
to
the
bay.
the
only
way
we
could
comply
with
that
statute
historically
was
to
set
up
a
resident
virginia
corporation
which
we
did
at
one
point.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
know.
there
is
a
further
definition
of
the
geographical
nature
referring
to
i
believe
cape
henry
and
some
other
fixture
that
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
--
further
delineates
the
area
in
question,
but
it
is
--
the
residency
statute
is
a
chesapeake
bay
statute,
the
other
statute
will
bar
us
entirely
from
any
waters
in
virginia.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
as
a
nonresident
corporation,
we
could
not
go
into
the
chesapeake.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
but
we
were
fishing
along
the
marginal
waters
of
the
coast.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it's
fair
to
say
that
that
triggered
this
because
that
meant
we
were
out
of
virginia
entirely.
without
a
resident
virginia
subsidiary,
we
were
already
out
of
the
chesapeake
bay
fishery
at
--
at
that
particular
point.
but
as
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
that's
right.
well,
the
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
as
far
as
our
thinking
on
the
matter
is
when
we
found
that
virginia
had,
in
our
view,
suddenly
adapted
emergency
legislation
which
only
applied
to
us.
we
thought
that
we
should
try
and
straighten
out
both
statutes
if
we
could,
and
so
we
sued
challenging
both
of
them.
the
record
shows,
for
example,
that
our
competitors
based
in
virginia
go
out
into
the
open
waters,
go
into
the
chesapeake
and
then
they
unload
their
catch
wherever
they
wish
including
neighboring
states
such
as
maryland
and
north
carolina.
we
think
we
should
have
similar
privileges.
we
should
come
down
from
new
jersey,
fish
the
coastal
waters
of
virginia
or
the
inland
waters,
by
that
i
mean
the
bay,
and
then
take
our
catch
back
to
our
processing
plant
in
port
monmouth,
new
jersey.
this
is
a
pattern
that
characterizes
the
industry.
the
--
the
menhaden
pay
very
little
attention
to
state
borders.
they
just
migrate
as
the
mood
takes
them
and
the
fisherman
want
to
be
where
the
fish
are
quite
obviously
and
you
can't
--
for
economic
reasons
have
a
plant
every
few
miles
up
and
down
the
coast.
it
--
it
involves
quite
a
bit
of
investment.
if
i
could
turn
for
just
a
moment
to
the
foreign
policy
point
here,
it
--
it
would
not
come
as
a
surprise
to
anyone
here
that
the
united
states
has
been
a
great
advocate
of
a
free
trade
historically,
we
like
to
be
free
to
make
american
investments
in
foreign
countries
and
the
quid
pro
quo
is
we
invite
foreign
countries
and
their
citizens
to
invest
in
the
united
states.
when
a
bill
at
the
federal
level
was
introduced,
that
would
have
had
the
same
effect
nationally
as
the
virginia
bill
has
in
its
state
which
would
have
in
effect
put
seacoast
entirely
out
of
business
in
the
menhaden
trade.
the
state
department
came
in,
the
treasury
department
came
in,
they
criticized
the
bill,
they
pointed
out
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
government's
position
on
--
on
free
movement
of
investment,
and
that
bill
died.
it
was
after
that
bill
died
that
our
competitor,
zapata
haynie
went
into
the
virgina
legislature
and
succeeded
in
richmond
where
they
had
failed
in
washington.
now,
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
there
was
a
hearing,
a
hearing
significant
i
--
i
submit
despite
the
kind
of
casual
brushing
of
it
away
in
our
--
upon
its
reply
brief.
there
was
a
hearing
under
the
auspices
of
the
federal
maritime
administration
conducted
actually
by
noaa,
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration.
the
factors
that
we
were
told
were
going
to
be
considered
as
a
condition
for
our
enrollment
and
licensing
in
the
menhaden
fishery.
included
such
matters
is
the
conservation
of
the
resource,
the
employment
of
u.s.
citizens,
the
effect
on
competition
and
other
social
and
economic
factors
in
united
states.
now,
there
was
a
hearing
and
our
competitors
came
in
and
tried
to
oppose
the
issuance
of
our
license.
noaa
heard
the
evidence.
they
satisfied
themselves.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
we
were
not
here
as
a
predator
about
to
wipe
out
a
valued
and
it
is
a
valued
u.s.
resource
and
run
away.
only
after
that
hearing,
were
we
enrolled?
now,
let's
just
pause
with
enrollment
for
a
moment.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
the
part
where
we
adjourned
for
lunch,
i
was
just
going
to
remark
briefly
on
the
subject
of
enrollment
and
licensing,
these
are
two
quite
different
concepts
and
i
wanted
to
highlight
them
briefly.
the
enrollment
process
is
the
process
by
which
a
determination
is
made
that
vessels
should
be
allowed
to
fly
the
american
flag
and
that
of
course
was
critical
here
upon
the
transfer
of
control
of
these
corporations
to
the
uk
corporation
and
some
trust.
it
was
necessary
to
go
into
this
enrollment
and
licensing
procedure.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes,
basically
the
same
thing.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
am
not
sure
that
they're
both
under
that
same
section.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
the
enrollment
aspect
as
distinguished
from
the
licensing
aspect
is
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
american
character
of
these
vessels.
now,
these
--
these
ships
are
going
to
be
plying
in
navigation
up
and
down
the
coast
and
they're
going
to
be
fishing
up
and
down
the
coast
and
then
anyone
of
the
number
of
states.
to
determine
the
american
character
of
the
vessels,
there
are
statutory
requirements
that
the
corporate
form
must
involve
a
domestic
corporation.
we
have
in
our
instance
the
delaware
corporation
for
an
example
or
new
york
corporation.
it
could
be
any
state
or
it
could
be
a
u.s.
corporation
but
it
must
be,
first
of
all,
a
domestic
corporation.
in
addition,
the
chief
executive
officer,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
corporation
must
be
american
citizen.
and
next,
as
to
the
vessels
themselves,
the
captain,
the
officers
and
the
crew
must
all
be
american
citizens.
now,
those
qualifications
must
be
met.
they
have
been
met
in
this
case
and
our
68
vessels
were
transferred
and
we're
permitted
to
be
enrolled
in
the
american
fishery.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
this
isn't
in
the
statute,
we
have
approximately
450,
500
employees
who
work
in
our
plants
and
95%
of
them
are
american
citizens
as
well.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
--
i
go
into
it
only
to
try
and
lay
a
foundation
for
claims,
i
will
later
make
as
to
the
consequences
that
flow
from
complying
with
the
statute.
i
would
like
simply
to
outline
the
steps
and
then
i
will
try
to
persuade
the
court,
show
the
court
what
consequences
flow
from
this
process.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
we're
into
the
enrollment
phrase
and
let's
say
it's
been
determined
that
we
are
permitted
to
fly
the
american
flag.
the
next
is
licensing.
and
this
is
critical
because
if
a
license
is
just
a
number
that
goes
on
bow
of
the
vessel
or
piece
of
paper
that
says
you
are
the
mary
jo,
that
would
not
be
enough.
we
have
gibbons
and
ogden
in
the
absolute
parallel
language
explaining
what
a
license
is.
it's
a
license
to
do
something,
not
just
tell
a
--
a
passing
ma
--
maritime
patrol
boat
who
you
are.
in
gibbons
and
ogden,
the
boat
was
licensed
to
ply
the
coastal
trade.
in
our
case,
we
are
licensed
to
engage
in
the
fisheries.
in
the
brief
submitted
amicus
by
the
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
no.
for
purposes
of
licensing,
you
have
opportunities
to
register
in
the
whale
fishery,
the
macro
fishery
or
the
cod
fishery
and
that's
all.
so,
you
--
you
--
for
this
purpose,
or
put
in
one
or
the
other
those
categories
and
simply
for
administrative
purposes,
the
menhaden
is
treated
as
part
of
the
macro
fishery,
but
i
think
biologically
as
far
as
i
know,
there
isn't
any
connection
or
if
so
not
a
close
one.
but
we
are
registered
in
the
--
in
the
macro
fishery
because
that's
the
statutory
format
and
not
being
whales
or
cod,
i
guess.
now,
what
do
the
license
do
in
the
--
in
the
brief
submitted
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
in
the
appendix
3a,
they
set
forth
the
license.
and
it
--
among
other
things
states
the
following.
license
is
hereby
granted
for
the
said
vessel
to
be
employed
in
carrying
on
the
macro
fishery
for
one
year
from
the
date
hereof
and
no
longer.
the
license
must
be
renewed
annually.
now,
we're
licensed
to
carry
on
the
macro
fishery
in
this
instance
the
fishing
for
menhaden
which
of
course
was
the
object
of
the
whole
thing.it
is
not
simply
to
identify
our
vessels
but
to
carry
on
that
fishery.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
if
congress
passed
a
statute
to
that
effect,
i
think
we
could.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well
i
assume
such
statute
would
be
in
conflict
with
that
or
might
be
in
conflict
with
it.
absent
a
new
statute,
i
think
the
point
of
that
law
was
triggered
by
some
problems
with
the
oil
arising
out
of
the
california
cases
and
evidently
it
was
--
while
it
was
--
i
won't
content
it
was
confined
to
oil.
certainly,
the
dispute
over
the
oil
rights
gave
rise
to
the
statute.
i
think
that's
historically
accurate.
but
what
congress
can
re-express
or
reallocate,
they
can
take
back.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
if
there
were
such
a
conflict,
yes.
and
let
me
address
myself
to
that
now.
we're
claiming
because
we
think
it's
unavoidable
that
the
license
we
obtained
through
the
process
i've
just
described
entitles
us
to
go
into
the
various
state
waters
and
fish.
it
may
also
entitle
us,
and
i
think
it
does
--
entitle
us
to
fish
in
offshore
waters
beyond
the
state
territorial
limits.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
as
to
that,
i
think
we
would
have
to
be
bound
by
that
as
well.
let
--
let
me
explain
what
i
mean
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it
--
it
is
a
right
subject
to
certain
police
controls
exerted
by
the
state
in
the
name
perhaps
of
conservation
or
health
or
what
have
you.
when
i
say
we
have
a
right
to
go
into
the
state
and
fish,
i
really
mean
we
have
the
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
unfairly
in
exercising
our
license.
i
am
not
claiming
here
that
by
giving
us
this
license,
the
federal
government
has
wiped
the
books
clean
of
every
coastal
states
fisheries
regulation.
that
is
not
our
position.
it's
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it's
--
it's
a
license
to
exercise
the
privileges
of
an
american
flag
vessel
which
means
you
have
the
right
to
be
treated
the
same
as
all
other
american
flag
vessels
and
that
includes
the
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
our
competitors
or
american
flag
vessels.
we
are
an
american
flag
vessel.
now,
if
the
state
of
virginia
decides
as
it
has,
for
example,
that
there
should
be
certain
close
seasons
on
menhaden
or
that
there
should
be
certain
tributaries
that
are
off
limits
for
fishing.
i
don't
claim
any
right
to
--
to
run
rough
shot
over
those
laws
far
from
it.
those
laws
don't
single
out
who
is
to
be
subject
to
them
and
who
is
not
to
be
subject
to
them.
we
are
here
faced
not
with
the
regulation
as
i
see
it.
we're
faced
with
an
absolute
bar.
virginia
is
saying
to
seacoast,
“you
can't
come
into
our
waters
because
you're
somehow
tainted
by
your
foreign
ownership.
we're
going
to
let
your
competitor's
fish.
we're
not
going
to
put
any
restrictions
on
how
much
fishing
they
do,
the
size
of
the
catch,
we're
not
going
to
require
them
to
land
their
fish
in
virginia,
but
we're
going
to
say
to
you,
“you
can't
come
in
here
and
fish
at
all.”
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
my
remarks
would
rest
to
how
much
fish
you
can
take.
there
are
close
seasons,
and
during
those
close
seasons,
the
virginia
boats
cannot
fish
and
we
could
not
fish.
there
are
without
question,
statutes
in
virginia
that
i
would
recognize
as
bona
fide
conservation
measures.
close
season
i
think
is
a
good
example
and
i
am
not
claiming
here
that
the
federal
government
has
preempted
that,
but
the
federal
government
has
done
to
restate
it,
is
giving
us
the
privilege
of
being
in
the
american
fleet
and
that
is
not
an
empty
gesture.
it
entitles
us
to
be
treated
legally
on
the
same
basis
as
all
other
members
of
the
american
fleet
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
menhaden.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
once
we
have
that,
the
state
cannot
make
an
independent
judgment
on
that
--
on
that
subject
because
the
--
the
superior
right
of
the
federal
government
is
clearly
at
stake,
particularly
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
once
you
have
the
federal
license.
the
question
of
our
foreign
ownership
was
displayed
to
the
federal
government.
the
question
of
the
impact
on
the
registration
of
these
vessels
in
the
american
fishery
was
gone
into
the
question
of
competition,
employment,
conservation.
those
questions
were
addressed
by
the
federal
government.
it
wasn't
an
empty
formality
that
we
went
through.
and
after
that
process,
i
say
those
questions
are
precluded
to
the
individual
states
otherwise,
you
go
through
all
this,
you
get
a
license
that
entitles
you
to
do
nothing.
it's
of
any
commercial
value.
as
a
practical
matter,
commercial
fishermen
do
not
fish
for
menhaden
to
any
extent
offshore
in
the
federal
waters.
the
fish
congregate
in
these
tight
schools
up
close
to
shore.
they're
in
state
waters
and
if
you
can't
fish
of
them
there,
you
really
can't
be
in
the
menhaden
business.
now,
in
--
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
advert
briefly
to
three
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
decisions
each
of
which
came
down
after
our
--
our
brief
was
written.
one
of
these
deals
with
commerce,
it's
the
boston
stock
exchange
case.
i'd
like
to
quote
briefly
from
that.
that
was
the
case
where
new
york,
my
state,
adapted
a
taxing
program
that
tended
to
favor
the
new
york
exchanges
as
against
the
regional
exchanges,
and
this
court
struck
down
that
statute
and
--
and
said
this,
“as
we
stated
at
the
offset,
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
clause
is
to
sure
--
to
assure
that
there
would
be
free
trade
among
the
several
states.
this
free
trade
purpose
is
not
confined
to
the
freedom
to
trade
with
only
one
state;
it
is
a
freedom
to
trade
with
any
state
to
engage
in
commerce
across
all
state
boundaries.
there
has
been
no
prior
occasion
expressly
to
address
the
question
whether
a
state
may
tax
in
a
manner
that
discriminates
between
two
types
of
interstate
transactions
in
order
to
pay
their
local
commercial
interests
over
out-of-state
business,
but
the
clear
import
of
our
commerce
clause
cases
is
at
such
discrimination
is
constitutionally
impermissible.”
we
have
here
in
this
virgina
bar,
it's
not
a
tax.
we
admit
that.
it's
much
more
fundamental
than
a
tax.
it's
a
complete
exclusion
and
it
was
done
i
think
without
any
doubt
to
favor
local
interest
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
the
--
the
statute
is
parallel
with
the
statute
giving
rights
to
navigation
and
all
of
that
was
explored
quite
extensively
in
gibbons
against
ogden
which
had
to
do
with
the
boat
that
was
going
from
elizabeth,
new
jersey
across
the
harbor
into
new
york.
these
were
up
into
state
waters.
the
statute
clearly
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well
it
was
much
more
involved
than
--
than
that.
it
--
it
put
into
juxtaposition
the
power
of
the
state
government
and
the
power
of
the
federal
government,
but
so
does
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
choose
not
to
press
my
argument
that
far
because
--
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
do
want
to
press
gibbons
against
ogden.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
it
is
a
form
of
discrimination.
the
--
a
man
who
had
what
he
thought
was
a
monopoly
on
the
coasting
trade
in
new
york
waters
was
trying
to
exclude
someone
who
had
a
federal
license.
he
was
enrolled
in
the
coasting
trade
under
the
same
statute
that
we're
claiming
our
rights
in
the
fishing
trade.
and
in
a
sense,
that's
a
strong
discrimination.
it
was
a
burden
and
it
seems
to
me,
it
sets
the
state
rights
of
new
york
or
that
new
york
thought
it
had
against
the
rights
of
the
federal
government.
now
in
closing,
we
have
the
two
equal
protection
cases
that
have
come
down
quite
recently,
lefkowitz
against
cdr
enterprises
on
january
10th
which
had
to
deal
with
the
exclusion
of
aliens
in
new
york
from
works
of
public
projects.
this
court
had
no
trouble
in
guaranteeing
aliens
the
right
to
work
on
public
projects
and
struck
that
on
equal
protection
grounds.
in
craig
against
boren
which
had
to
do
with
the
beer
regulation,
beer
drinking
regulations
in
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
i
think
--
i
take
some
comfort
from
each
of
them.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
and
i
--
i
feel
that
the
standards
they
have
established
are
applicable
respectively
with
the
equal
protection
approach
or
the
commerce
clause
to
our
situation.
i
bring
them
up
only
because
they
were
recent,
they're
nowhere
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
they're
very
helpful
and
sustaining
position.
mr.
john
j.
loflin,
jr.
thank
you
very
much!
