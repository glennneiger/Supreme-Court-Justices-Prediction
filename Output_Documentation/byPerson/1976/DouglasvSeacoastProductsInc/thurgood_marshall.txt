justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
loflin,
record
show
how
long
seacoast
has
been
fishing
in
chesapeake
bay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
way
back.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
you've
been
fishing
all
along
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
decided
to
go
against
--
that's
not
true.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
that
you'd
been
fishing
in
chesapeake
bay
continuously
over
a
long
period
of
years
and
then
when
the
corporation
changed,
suddenly
they
went
after
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that's
not
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
state
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
passed
the
law
that
there
shall
be
no
fishing
of
this
type
of
fish
in
the
chesapeake
bay
by
anybody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
--
it's
not
an
absolute
right.
it's
a
right
subject
to
others.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
are
your
requirements
on
fishing
and
how
many,
of
course,
virginia,
you
can
fish
anytime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
congress
could
take
care
of
that
by
saying
that
no
foreign
corporations
could
operate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
mean
your
dire
results
don't
have
to
happen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
not
same
way,
but
some
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
at
issue
is
the
validity
of
two
virginia
statutes
that
limit
the
rights
of
aliens
and
of
non-residence
of
the
commonwealth
to
engage
in
commercial
fishing
in
virginia's
territorial
waters.
under
an
act
pay
us
to
1975,
"alien
fishermen
may
not
catch
fish
anywhere
in
virginia
that
would
be
processed
for
industrial
use,"
an
older
law
permitting
non-residence
to
catch
such
fish
in
three-mile
wide
territorial
sea
of
the
virginia's
east
coast,
but
prohibits
them
from
fishing
in
the
waters
of
chesapeake
bay.
appellees
are
three
related
corporations
engaged
in
commercial
fishing
for
menhaden
fish.
that's
inedible
fish
used
for
commercial
purposes
only.
under
affidavits
of
the
virginia
statute,
the
appellees
are
considered
to
be
both
non-residence
and
aliens,
and
they
are
unable
to
pursue
their
business
in
virginia.
appellees
brought
this
suit
enjoined
and
forced
from
the
state
laws
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
repugnant
to
various
federal
laws
and
constitutional
provisions.
a
three-judge
district
court
granted
the
relief
and
the
state
official
responsible
for
enforcing
the
law
has
appealed
to
us.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
both
of
the
virginia
statutes
are
invalid
because
they
are
preempted
by
the
federal
licensing
and
enrolment
act.
under
this
federal,
law
dating
from
1793,
appellees
have
been
granted
federal
licenses
given
their
fishing
vessels
the
right
to
quote
"to
be
employed
and
carrying
on
the
mackerel
fishery,"
which
includes
the
right
to
fish
for
menhaden.
in
the
case
of
gibbons
against
ogden
decide
unimproved
few
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
a
license
issued
under
the
state'
statute
under
the
same
statute,
federal
statute
to
a
vessel
employed
in
the
coasting
trade,
preempted
a
state
law
prohibiting
such
use
of
the
vessel
in
state
waters.
because
we
conclude
that
appellees'
federal
fishery
licenses
have
the
same
preemptive
effect
as
the
coasting
license
in
gibbons,
the
conflicting
virginia
law
must
fall
under
the
supremacy
clause.
i
should
add,
however,
that
the
federal
right
granted
to
appellees
only
allows
them
to
fish
in
virginia
waters
on
the
same
terms
as
other
state
residence
does
come
for
suit
fishing
laws
that
operate,
even
handling
against
all
fishermen
such
as
seasonal
fishing
restrictions
and
limits
on
total
catch,
the
size
of
the
fish
taken
or
the
use
of
certain
fishing
gear
are
not
affected
by
our
decision.
states
can
thus
protect
their
marine
resources
from
destructive
overfishing.
all
that
they
may
not
do
is
reserve
them
exclusively
for
their
own
residence
or
citizens
while
excluding
other
fishermen
licensed
under
federal
law.
