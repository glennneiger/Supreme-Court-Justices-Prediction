mr.
james
e.
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
questions
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
two
virginia
statutes
under
which
the
state
of
virginia
licenses
corporations
for
the
taking
of
fish
in
its
territorial
waters.
the
statutes
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
beginning
at
page
114.
the
first
of
these
statutes
is
virginia
code
section
28.1-60.
i
refer
to
that
section
60
or
the
residency
law.
by
this
statute,
virginia
regulates
one
of
its
fisheries,
the
chesapeake
bay
and
menhaden
fishery.
so
this
statute
is
limited
to
one
fishery
and
one
body
of
water
in
inland
sea,
chesapeake
bay.
by
virtue
of
this
statute,
foreign
--
excuse
me
--
non-resident
corporations
are
ineligible
for
licenses
for
the
taking
of
menhaden
in
the
chesapeake
bay
fishery.
they
are
eligible
for
the
taking
of
menhaden
in
the
atlantic
coastal
waters
of
virginia
within
the
three-mile
territorial
sea.
the
appellees
in
this
case
seacoast
products,
incorporated
and
its
two
subsidiaries,
the
new
smith
mill
company
and
second,
the
oceanic
corporation.
our
corporation
is
located
and
having
their
principal
places
of
business
in
new
jersey
and
new
york
and
are
not
under
the
virginia
statute
resident
corporations.
they
are
therefore
do
not
have
licenses
for
the
chesapeake
bay
and
menhaden
fishery.
the
second
of
these
two
statutes
is
found
at
page
117
in
the
appendix,
this
is
titled
28.1
of
code
of
virginia
section
81.1.
for
ease
of
discussion,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
that
as
section
81.
by
the
statute,
virginia
provides
that
all
of
its
fisheries
that
foreign-controlled
corporations
shall
be
ineligible
for
licenses
for
any
of
virginia's
fisheries.
the
test
of
foreign
control
considers
various
factors
including
the
president
and
chief
executive
officer
or
other
chief
executive
officer
and
the
board
of
directors
chairman,
also
the
percentage
of
stockholding
by
united
states
citizens.
in
essence,
it
requires
that
the
control
in
the
corporation
through
stockholders
be
in
the
hands
of
united
states
citizens.
the
lower
court
upon
request
of
the
appellees
held
that
these
statutes
violated
certain
constitutional
provisions.
the
--
the
lower
court
held
first
of
all
that
the
--
the
bay
menhaden
residency
law
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
thereby
inform
--
restrained
further
enforcement
of
this
act.
the
lower
court
held
that
section
81
which
bars
foreign-controlled
corporations
from
taking
fish
in
virginia
was
preempted
by
force
of
a
federal
act,
the
bartlett
act.
this
statute
is
set
out
on
page
118
of
the
appendix.
i
first
turned
to
the
question
of
preemption
and
we
would
submit
of
course
that
the
lower
courts
holding
to
the
effect
that
section
81
by
foreign-controlled
corporations
in
virginia's
fisheries
is
not
preempted
either
by
the
bartlett
act
or
any
other
federal
enactment.
the
lower
court
held
of
course
that
the
bartlett
act,
16
u.s.c.,
section
108
preempted
virginia's
right
to
deny
licenses
to
foreign-controlled
corporations
within
these
territorial
waters
under
section
81.
but
the
bartlett
act,
it's
clear,
it
applies
only
to
united
states
vessels
--
excuse
me
--
applies
only
to
foreign
flag
vessels.
this
--
this
act
bars
foreign
flag
vessels
from
fishing
within
12
miles
of
united
states'
coast
under
current
law.
under
the
new
provisions
of
the
extended
u.s.
fishery
zone,
foreign
flag
vessels
will
be
barred
from
fishing
within
200
miles
of
the
united
states'
coast.
in
any
event
the
federal
act
clearly
applies
only
to
foreign
flag
vessels.
the
virginia
act
here
clearly
applies
to
united
states
flag,
domestic
fishing
vessels,
albeit
operated
by
foreign
controlled
corporations.
the
waters
affected
are
virginia's
waters
and
therefore
the
two
statutes
cannot
possibly,
as
a
practical
matter,
conflict.
the
united
states
in
this
brief
has
agreed
with
our
position
on
that
and
we
take
special
note
of
that
because
the
united
states,
of
course,
is
responsible
for
enforcement
of
the
bartlett
act.
they
find
no
preemptive
effect
or
intent
in
the
federal
bartlett
act.
mr.
james
e.
moore
for
purposes
of
the
documentation
laws
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
for
purposes
of
the
bartlett
act
that
the
united
states'
position
would
perhaps
be
that
they
are
u.s.
vessels,
the
ones
operated
by
seacoast
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
moore
for
purposes
of
virginia's
fishery's
regulation
which
we
contend
is
not
reached
by
the
documentation
laws.
they
are
in
effect
foreign
vessels
because
foreign
control
is
in
fact
in
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
moore
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
james
e.
moore
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
james
e.
moore
we
say
they
are
u.s.
flag
vessels
operated
by
foreign
controlled
corporations.
mr.
james
e.
moore
and
that
there
are
reasons
to
believe,
very
strong
reasons
that
foreign
controlled
corporation
can
operate
a
united
states
flag
vessel
and
deplete
fisheries
in
the
same
manner
that
the
foreign
flag
vessels
have
in
fact
depleted
our
fisheries
and
that
is
a
rationale
which
underlies
virginia's
view
of
the
foreign
control
being
the
decisive
factor
in
whether
or
not
they
should
be
allowed
entry
to
state
fisheries.
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
right.
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
the
documentation
laws
do
not
take
into
account
fisheries
preservation.
they
are
for
other
purposes
and
therefore
these
statutes
would
have
in
no
way
conflict
with
federal
law
but
in
fact
would
supplement,
provide
protection
to
virginia's
fisheries
which
is
not
provided
by
federal
laws
at
the
present
time.
we've
stated
that
we
think
the
bartlett
act
itself
has
no
preemptive
effect
and
further
the
seacoast
and
united
states
have
asserted
certain
theories
of
preemption
under
the
documentation
laws
and
as
i
have
just
stated,
our
position
is
that
the
documentation
laws
have
never
been
construed
by
this
court
to
affect
fishing
in
state
waters.
there's
this
--
a
series
of
cases
beginning
with
the
case
of
smith
versus
maryland,
an
1855
case,
followed
by
manchester
versus
massachusetts.
in
those
two
cases,
federal
vessel
licensees
claimed
that
their
--
their
federal
license
of
a
fishing
vessel
exempted
them
from
state
fisheries
laws
and
in
both
cases,
the
supreme
court
said
fishing
laws
of
the
states
are
not
affected,
limited
or
preempted
by
force
of
the
federal
documentation
of
a
vessel.
mr.
james
e.
moore
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
correct.
they
can
be
shipped
wherever
they
want,
processed
wherever
they
like.
it
relates
solely
to
the
taking
of
fish
in
state
waters
which
in
several
cases
including
alaska
versus
the
arctic
bay.
this
court
has
said
the
act
of
taking
fish
as
a
localized
activity,
not
involved
in
the
stream
or
flow
of
commerce.
that
position
clarifies
the
effect
of
the
federal
documentation
laws,
and
in
fact,
these
laws
passed
under
the
commerce
power
of
the
congress
cannot
reach
the
taking
of
fish
in
state
waters.
they
relate
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
the
federal
license
was
considered
in
huron
portland
cement
versus
detroit,
and
in
that
case,
it
was
said
that
the
federal
vessel
license
is
not
preemptive
of
state
fishery
--
state
abatement
of
air
pollution
laws,
the
manchester
and
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
--
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
james
e.
moore
which
said
that
a
certain
vessel
shall
be
licensed
for
the
fisheries.
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
language
from
46
u.s.c.
section
251.
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
--
that's
the
license
i
assert
gives
the
right
to
take
fish
in
state
waters
and
we
contend
of
course
that
it
does
not
give
the
right
to
take
fish
in
state
waters.
it's
a
statute
if
i
may
pass
upon
the
commerce
power
which
does
not
reach
the
taking
of
fish.
mr.
james
e.
moore
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
moore
no,
sir.
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
does.
it
is
never
been
viewed
by
this
court
as
--
as
doing
that
in
any
case.
it's
been
viewed
as
a
license
to
navigate
in
gibbons
versus
ogden,
but
the
distinction
between
navigation
and
fisheries
has
always
been
maintained.
the
language
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
it
could
in
the
coastal
zone
in
which
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
authority
over
fisheries
between
the
area
--
between
three
miles
and
200
miles
effective
march
1
or
three
to
12
miles
under
present
law.
yes,
it
could
very
well
because
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
fisheries
control
in
that
area.our
position
would
be
at
best.
there
is
a
concurrent
requirement
of
state
and
federal
licenses
and
that
federal
licenses
have
never
been
preempted
within
their
state
waters.
mr.
james
e.
moore
three
miles
inward,
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
moore
i
don't
think
they
could,
your
honor.
in
--
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
united
states
confirmed
the
states
ownership
of
all
mineral
resources,
fisheries,
shellfish
within
three
miles
of
the
united
states
coast
in
--
in
there
inland
waters.
mr.
james
e.
moore
we
don't
believe
it
does.
the
submerged
lands
act
treats
them
equally
and
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
yes,
sir.
yes,
we
do.
it
--
it
treats
specifically.
fish,
shellfish
of
all
types
with
no
distinction
being
made
regarding
the
mobility
or
migratory
and
nature
of
the
fish.
it
cedes
and
confirms
the
state's
ownership
of
all
these
mineral
resources
and
fisheries
within
three
miles
of
the
united
states
coast.
i'd
like
to
read
you
the
provision
from
the
submerged
lands
act
if
i
may.
this
is
found
at
43
united
states
code
section
1311(a).
it
set
forth
and
says,
“confirmation
and
establishment
of
title
and
ownership
of
lands
and
resources,
it
is
determined
and
cleared
to
be
in
the
public
interest
that
title
to
and
ownership
of
the
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
within
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
states,
and
the
natural
resources
within
such
lands
and
waters,
and
the
right
and
power
to
manage,
administer,
lease,
develop
and
use
the
said
lands
and
natural
resources
shall
be
in
the
states.”
mr.
james
e.
moore
and
they
treat
those
resources
equally.
mr.
james
e.
moore
and
the
waters,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
says
as
well.
mr.
james
e.
moore
i
believe
they
did.
in
fact,
that
was
the
question
in
natural
resources
that
it
find
in
the
act,
your
honor
just
say,
“natural
resources
is
a
subsection
(e)
of
1301
43
u.s.c.
1301(e)
says,
“natural
resources'
includes,
without
limiting
the
generality
thereof,
oil,
gas,
and
all
other
minerals
and
fish,
shrimp,
oysters,
clams,
crabs,
lobsters,
sponges
and
so
forth.”
so
there's
unquestioned
right
in
the
states
to
own,
manage
and
regulate
these
resources
including
fish,
shellfish
and
(inaudible)
mr.
james
e.
moore
they
have
never
fished
chesapeake
bay
in
the
past.
they
--
first
statute,
i
called
to
your
attention,
section
60
requires
residency
for
corporations
and
they
were
barred
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
not
until
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
moore
we
submit
then
that
submerged
lands
act
confirms
that
the
documentation
laws
do
not
confer
a
right
to
fish
and
reach
only
the
vessel
that
states
have
a
free
and
clear
right
to
license
their
fisheries
and
determine
who
shall
take
the
resources
within
their
boundaries.
an
alternative
theory
of
preemption
has
been
offered
that
the
fact
that
seacoast
vessels
which
they
purchased
from
an
american
controlled
corp
--
controlled
corporation.
the
fact
that
this
transfer
or
sail
was
approved
by
the
united
states
under
a
procedure
of
the
shipping
act
sections
9
and
37,
that
this
in
fact
preempts
the
right
of
virginia
under
section
81
to
bar
seacoast
as
a
foreign
controlled
corporation.
it's
clear
from
several
sources
that
these
acts,
the
--
the
shipping
act
sections
9
and
37
have
--
as
their
sole
purpose
control
of
the
sail
of
vessels
to
foreign
interest
for
the
purpose
of
national
defense
and
security,
counsel
for
the
maritime
administration
in
recent
hearings
looking
into
foreign
investment
in
american
fisheries
has
confirmed
this.
we
have
referred
to
it
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
11,
footnote
3.
in
that
case
--
in
that
instance,
he
indicated
that
the
sole
purpose
of
these
statutes
is
national
defense,
certainly
not
to
preempt
the
right
of
the
states
license
for
taking
a
fish
within
their
borders.
we
would
submit
therefore
that
no
federal
enactment
cited
by
seacoast
or
the
united
states
in
any
way
preempts
or
even
purports
to
preempt
the
right
of
the
states
to
license
fisheries.
that
be
the
case,
the
remaining
question
is
whether
or
not
the
two
statutes
under
consideration
here,
license
fishing
in
virginia's
waters
under
constitution
inconsistent
with
constitutional
principles,
and
we
submit
that
both
statutes
do.
the
first
statute,
section
81,
is
clearly
a
conservation
of
fisheries
statute.
the
depletion
of
the
united
states
fisheries
stocks
by
foreign
fishing
interest
is
well
documented.
the
findings
of
congress
in
passage
of
the
new
federal
act,
public
law
94265
known
as
the
fishery
conservation
and
management
act,
the
--
the
findings
of
congress
in
that
case
document
the
fact
that
foreign
fishing
interest,
because
of
their
self-interest
in
economic
gain
have
depleted
our
fisheries
in
nearly
every
instance
where
they
have
been
allowed
to
fish
either
outside
the
12-mile
limit
or
inside
the
12-mile
limit
under
permits
and
international
agreements.
in
those
cases,
they
have
violated
agreements
made
enforcement
impractical
and
in
fact,
this
is
the
factor
which
has
led
the
way
in
extending
the
united
states
fishery
zone
out
to
200
miles.
the
virginia
law
is
premised
upon
the
same
findings.
virginia
has
suffered
at
the
hands
of
foreign
fishing.
the
entire
river
herring
industry
in
virginia
was
destroyed
virtually
in
a
period
of
two
to
three
years
of
foreign
fishing,
scooping
up
the
fish
as
they
exited
virginia's
waters
to
spawn
and
depleting
entirely
the
stocks.
the
virginia
law
saw
the
advent
of
the
new
200-mile
law
and
recognized
that
there
would
be
a
great
attempt
by
foreign
fishing
interest
to
avoid
the
new
200-mile
federal
law
by
operating
united
states
flag
vessels.
the
federal
law
simply
provides
that
foreign
flag
vessels
may
not
enter
beyond
the
line
of
200
miles,
but
it
does
not
in
any
way
protect
the
states
from
foreign
fishing
interest
who
would
set
up
shell
corporations
in
any
of
the
states
including
virginia
and
thereby
be
eligible
under
federal
law
to
license
their
vessels
as
domestic
united
states
flag
vessels,
the
same
situation
that
pertains
with
seacoast
and
fish
with
impunity
in
virginia
waters.
the
evil
has
been
established
here
that
the
foreign
fishing
practices
do
deplete
fisheries,
and
in
fact,
virginia
laws
merely
supplements
federal
law
in
seeking
to
protect
its
waters
from
possible
dangers
and
in
fact
very
probable
dangers
of
an
influx
of
foreign
investment
in
u.s.
vessels
setting
up
shell
corporations
to
meet
any
residency
requirements
of
the
states
and
the
complete
and
other
destruction
of
our
fisheries.
seacoast
has
attempted
to
show
this
law
as
directed
at
them
alone
but
in
fact
this
law
applies
to
all
of
virginia's
fishing
industry,
all
fisheries
and
foreign-controlled
corporations
are
barred
from
all
fishing
in
virginia
not
simply
the
menhaden
industry
in
which
seacoast
has
in
fact
been
engaged.
and
furthermore,
seacoast
has
presented
no
real
competitive
factor
in
the
past
as
we've
outlined
in
our
brief.
thirty
six
--
pages
36
and
37
of
the
appendix
indicate
that
seacoast
has
done
little
or
no
fishing
in
recent
years
in
virginia
so
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
attach
the
motive
of
elimination
of
competition
to
the
statute.
it's
clearly
premised
upon
the
same
findings
and
conservation
purposes
as
the
federal
act
and
we
submit
that
in
that
light,
it
clearly
meets
the
constitutional
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
consistent
with
the
holdings
of
mcgowan
versus
maryland
and
a
series
of
other
cases.
turning
now
to
the
virginia
residency
law,
i
would
note
first
that
if
--
if
the
application
of
virginia's
foreign
controlled
corporation
law
barring
the
taking
of
fish
in
virginia
waters
by
foreign-controlled
corporations
section
81.
if
that
statute
is
upheld
in
this
case
as
applied
to
seacoast,
there
is
no
need
to
reach
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
second
statute
about
which
i'm
ready
to
speak.
section
60
would
bar
the
nonresident
corporations
in
virginia's
chesapeake
bay.
its
prescription
is
much
more
limited
in
effect.
this
statute
applies
to
an
industry
which
may
be
helpful
if
we
discuss
something
about
the
menhaden
industry
to
put
this
statute
in
perspective.
menhaden
entered
the
coastal
waters
of
the
united
states
in
the
early
spring
and
began
migrating
up
the
atlantic
coast
spawning
in
their
migration.
the
newly
spawned
fingerlings
entered
coastal
waters
primarily
the
chesapeake
bay
and
other
large
embayments
with
estuaries
which
lead
off
as
protective
nurseries
for
these
fish.
virginia's
residency
requirement
under
section
60
does
not
apply
to
the
three-mile
atlantic
coastal
menhaden
fishery,
and
therefore
there's
no
impediment
to
the
migration
of
menhaden.
furthermore,
the
virgina
season
on
the
taking
of
menhaden
in
the
chesapeake
bay
does
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
migration
of
mature
menhaden
out
of
the
bay
during
the
winter
months,
the
early
--
early
winter
months
and
the
late
fall.
when
the
fishing
is
done
in
virginia
in
the
bay
by
residents,
it
is
on
a
relatively
stabled
population
of
fish.
the
young
fish
are
those
that
populate
the
bay
and
is
a
rather
fragile
resource
because
they
are
two-year
old
and
less
fish,
the
manumbar
or
mataura
fish
migrate
up
and
down
the
coastal
waters
in
the
more
northern
section
before
returning
and
migrating
south
for
the
winter.
with
that
in
mind,
the
virginia
statute
is
limited
to
the
chesapeake
bay
and
inland
body
of
water
and
it
simply
provides
that
residents
only
in
terms
of
corporate
residency
may
take
these
fish.
we
submit
that
this
statute
is
consistent
with
the
holding
in
mccready
versus
virginia
by
this
court
holding
that
the
ownership
of
the
inland
waters
and
their
natural
resources
supports
the
right
of
the
state
to
reserve
those
resources
for
its
residence.
there
is
no
reason
as
a
practical
matter
to
apply
different
rule
in
this
case
with
regards
to
menhaden.
mr.
james
e.
moore
it
is
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
(inaudible)
mr.
james
e.
moore
yes,
he
may.
your
honor,
this
statute
reserves
only
the
privilege
of
taking
to
residence
and
we
submit
that
that
is
one
of
the
factors
which
clearly
indicates
that
it's
limited
statute
and
is
not
intended
to
in
any
way
infringement
commerce.
mr.
james
e.
moore
i
--
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
moore
there
is
a
very
unique
situation
with
regard
to
fisheries
as
a
natural
resource.
many
natural
resources,
in
fact
most
natural
resources,
in
order
to
take
them,
a
--
a
firm
must
in
fact
establish
some
commitment
and
connection
with
the
community,
establish
some
economic
benefit
for
the
community
in
terms
of
employment
to
the
mine
ore
or
take
clay
or
sand
or
gravel
requires
in
fact
some
employment
generated
from
the
local
community.
with
fisheries,
fisheries
can
be
subject
to
the
reaping
and
harvesting
by
other
state
vessels
with
out-of-state
crews,
with
virtually
no
return
for
the
resource
to
the
state
and
the
complete
depletion
in
fact
if
enough
non-residence
fishing
were
done
so
that
virginia
in
fact
economically
would
receive
no
benefit
from
a
resource
which
the
submerged
lands
act
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
your
honor,
this
statute,
we
feel
has
a
conservation
purpose
as
well.
and
if
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
reasons
for
that
indicating
that
it
matches
and
eases
enforcement
of
certain
clearly
conservation
or
in
the
statutes
namely
virginia's
net
size
regulation,
virginia's
food
fish
limitation.
there's
a
limitation
on
the
amount
of
food
fish
that
can
be
taken
in
any
menhaden
catch.
these
are
non-edible
industrial
fish
and
in
that
sense,
the
food
fish
limitation
and
the
net
size
regulation
are
much
more
easily
enforced
against
the
non
--
against
the
resident
who
lands
his
fish
in
virginia
and
the
nonresident
who
potentially
can
come
in,
take
the
fish
and
leave
virtually
unenforced.
the
--
the
peculiar
nature
of
fishery's
resources
however,
i
think
is
the
important
reason
why
residency
is
a
matter
of
fact
with
regard
to
many
industries
without
being
required
by
law
and
in
fact
fisheries
can
be
taken
without
any
return
to
the
community
which
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
case,
mccready
versus
virginia
say
the
states
own.
mr.
james
e.
moore
i
think
--
i
think
in
--in
some
sense,
the
same
argument
would
apply
if
in
fact
the
predominant
practice
of
nonresident
pickers
was
to
come
in,
pick
and
leave
without
in
fact
any
connection
or
economic
benefit
to
the
community.
but
in
fact,
we
would
submit
that
that
characteristic
is
uniquely
the
case
with
fisheries
more
than
many
other
industries.
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
moore
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
the
--
we
would
submit
as
a
final
thought
in
this
matter
that
to
the
extent
that
mccready
is
in
anyway
questioned
as
a
result
of
toomer.
that
toomer
case
was
a
privileges
and
immunities
case
that
the
appellants
and
appellees
here
are
not
in
any
way
--
cannot
in
any
way
be
viewed
as
citizens
protected
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
there
is
no
authority
interrogation
of
the
mccready
rule
which
is
that
the
resources
owned
by
state
maybe
reserved
particularly
fisheries
because
of
their
unique
nature
maybe
reserved
to
its
residents.
these
corporations
are
foreign-controlled
corporations
domesticated
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
in
fact
cannot
qualify
citizens.
the
benefits
therefore
of
the
toomer
holding
do
not
give
them
standing.
mr.
james
e.
moore
that's
true.
mr.
james
e.
moore
we
view
the
--
the
foreign
control
as
--
as
control
--
as
critical.
the
--
the
stockholders
of
course
dictate
policy
and
the
--
the
line
of
course
must
be
drawn
at
some
point,
but
we
think
that
the
virginia
statute
draws
that
--
that
line
at
a
reasonable
place.
in
fac,
the
factors
which
are
considered
in
determining
corporate
foreign
control
were
opted
from
a
federal
statute
which
applies
to
the
coasting
trade
and
the
licensing
of
vessels
for
that
purpose.
mr.
james
e.
moore
the
rule
under
the
virginia
statute
is
that
75%
of
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
that
meets
--
meets
the
test.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
moore
not
--
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
corporations
have
never
in
my
view,
under
any
holding
that
i
am
aware
of,
been
viewed
as
citizens
under
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
james
e.
moore
not
--
we
do
not.
mr.
james
e.
moore
we
do
not
think
so
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
moore
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder.
mr.
james
e.
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
point
we
would
like
to
address
is
the
apparent
reference
to
virginia
code
section
81
which
has
been
cast
in
the
light
as
if
it
were
a
statute
which
was
specifically
designed
to
exclude
one
competitor
from
competing
with
two
virginia
corporations.
that
fact
is
belied
by
the
fact
that
this
statue
applies
to
every
single
fishery
and
fishing
industry
in
virginia.
it
does
not
confine
itself
to
the
menhaden
fishery.
seacoast
is
involved
entirely
in
the
menhaden
fishery
and
had
it
been
designed
to
eliminate
seacoast
alone,
it
could
have
swept
much
less
broadly
and
achieve
the
same
purpose.
in
addition
the
entire
fishing
industry
supported
this
law
at
the
state
legislature
--
legislative
level,
not
simply
the
menhaden
fishers.
in
addition,
this
particular
statute
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
of
virginia
fishery.
mr.
james
e.
moore
no,
sir.
it
was
prompted
by
the
passage
of
a
federal
law
which
extended
the
two
--
the
federal
fishery
zone
to
200
miles.
the
testimony
in
recent
hearings
before
congress
referred
to
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
27
indicates
very
clearly
that
virginia's
fears
were
real.
the
new
law
at
the
federal
level
is
going
to
instigate
a
concerted
effort
by
foreign
fishing
interest
to
get
around
that
200-mile
limit
through
the
use
of
american
shell
corporations
and
united
states
flag
vessels.
mr.
james
e.
moore
the
new
statute
is
not
directed
to
seacoast,
it's
directed
at
this
national
problem
which
the
federal
level
protection
does
not
afford
complete
protection
for
the
states
nor
has
it
been
intended
to.
excuse
me.
mr.
james
e.
moore
it
could,
your
honor,
but
it
has
not.
mr.
james
e.
moore
if
the
federal
government
would
act
in
the
same
way
that
virginia
has
acted
to
protect
its
own
fisheries,
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
moore
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
e.
moore
they
did
in
that
case.
i
mean
the
shipping
act
does
to
the
coast
was
trade,
that's
correct
and
requires
75%
ownership
by
united
states
citizens.
mr.
james
e.
moore
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that's
correct.
a
reference
in
that
statute
to
joint
jurisdiction
or
jointly
control
waters
is
to
the
potomac
river
which
is
jointly
controlled
by
maryland
--
mr.
james
e.
moore
and
virginia.
and
it's
not
intended
to
go
out
into
the
three-mile
belt.
the
residency
requirement
applies
only
to
the
inland
waters
in
the
chesapeake
bay.
thank
you.
