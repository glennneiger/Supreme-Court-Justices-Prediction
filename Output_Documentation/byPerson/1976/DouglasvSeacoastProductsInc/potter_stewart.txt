do
you
think
virginia
and
united
states
have
the
same
view
as
to
whether
these
vessels
are
foreign
vessels
or
domestic
vessels?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
for
purposes
of
the
bartlett
act.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
united
states
looked
at
these
ships
as
foreign
vessels
same
as
virginia
does,
then
the
bartlett
act
would
apply.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
the
--
the
virginia
law
might
be
in
some
trouble
then?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
united
states
and
the
virginia
have
diametrically
opposing
views
as
to
whether
these
ships
are
foreign
vessels
or
not.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
say
they
are
foreign
vessels.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
they
never
get
very
big,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
really?
justice
potter
stewart
not
if
your
class
can
help
it,
they
will.
