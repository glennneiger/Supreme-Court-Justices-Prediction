justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
case
--
actually
its
four
cases
led
by
76-180
which
is
here
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
it
was
an
action
brought
by
individual
foster
parents
and
a
foster
parent's
organization
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
certain
new
york
state
and
new
york
city
officials
alleging
that
the
statutory
and
regulatory
procedures
for
removal
of
foster
children
from
foster
homes
violated
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses.
the
three-judge
district
court
held
that
indeed
the
state's
pre-removal
procedures
are
constitutionally
defective
and
that
before
a
foster
child
can
be
peremptorily
transferred
to
another
foster
home
or
indeed
even
back
to
its
natural
parents
is
entitled
to
an
administrative
hearing
at
which
all
concerned
parties
may
present
relevant
information.
but
we
don't
agree
and
we
reversed,
we
hold
that
the
challenge
procedures
under
new
york
law
are
constitutionally
adequate
even
where
at
to
be
assumed
that
the
appellees,
the
foster
parents
and
foster
parent's
organization
have
a
protected
liberty
interest
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined.
