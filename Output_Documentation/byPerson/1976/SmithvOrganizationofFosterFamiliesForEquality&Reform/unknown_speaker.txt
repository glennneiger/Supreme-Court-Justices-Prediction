unknown
speaker
your
clients
voluntarily
turned
over
their
children
for
temporary
foster
care?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
the
result
of
a
court
order...
unknown
speaker
because
the
children
were
delinquent
or
neglected
or...
unknown
speaker
or
illness
or
something?
unknown
speaker
so
this
was
voluntary
on
their
part
and
when
they
did
so,
what
was
the
understanding
as
to
their
conditions
under
which
the
children
would
return
to
them?
unknown
speaker
assured
by
statutory
law?
unknown
speaker
when
you
are
fit,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
i
don't
want
to
get
ahead
of
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
are
ready
to
--
unknown
speaker
the
foster-parent
relationship,
then,
isn’t
an
incipient
adoption
at
all
where
the
natural
parent
has
signed
off.
unknown
speaker
who
or
what
triggers
the
hearing
in
new
york
state
under
the
conditions
that
you
just
described
to
permanently
terminate
the
birth
parents?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
would
draw
the
state’s
attention
to
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
basically,
to
monitor
the
situation?
unknown
speaker
ms.
gans,
in
this
case
i
saw
he
has
been
there
four
years
or
more?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
did
that
happen?
unknown
speaker
no
habeas
corpus?
unknown
speaker
i
hear
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
standard,
was
the
standard
imposed?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
do
you
say
who
must
prevail
in
a
custody
proceeding,
the
parent?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
a
contest;
it
may
not
be.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
to
find
out
what?
unknown
speaker
i
know
to
provide
a
forum;
to
find
out
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
the
only
thing
the
district
court
might
want
the
hearing
to
provide
is,
as
you
say,
a
forum
where
the
agency
can
come
in
and
formally
say,
"yes,
we
do
not
think
there
is
anything
wrong
with
the
children
going
back
to
their
parents".
unknown
speaker
so
i
take
it,
then,
you
think
the
standard
really
would
be
at
the
hearing
what
are
the
best
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
one
question.
what
are
the
best
interests
of
the
child?
unknown
speaker
no,
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
district
court
say
that?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
they
did
not
provide
a
standard.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
the
foster
parent
has
the
burden,
then,
of
proving
unfitness
for
the
parent?
unknown
speaker
the
parent
hasn’t
got
any
burden.
unknown
speaker
if
the
foster
parent
has
the
burden,
why,
the
foster
parent
is
going
to
have
to
put
on
some
evidence,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
what
the
district
court
holding
says
is
even
though
the
foster
parent
has
presented
that
evidence
to
the
social
worker
and
the
social
worker
has
gone
through
the
investigate
and
found
nothing
to
it,
nonetheless
there
must
still
be
a
due-process
hearing.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
one
question,
please.
what
is
the
requirement
of
notice
to
the
foster
parent
before
the
child
is
returned
to
the
natural
parents?
what
does
the
state
require?
is
there
any
requirement
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
that
is
upon
ten
days'
notice,
however,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
statutory
notice.
unknown
speaker
but
the
statute
itself,
the
new
york
law,
does
provide,
as
i
understood
it
from
reading
these
briefs,
that
if
a
child
has
been
in
a
foster
home
for
18
months
or
longer.
the
foster
parents
are
given
an
opportunity
to
try
to
explain
why
the
child
should
not
leave
the
foster
home.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
in
the
interest
of
the
child’s
welfare
the
child
should
not
leave
the
foster
home.
unknown
speaker
sometimes
it
is
returned
to
natural
parents,
sometimes
it
is
transferred
to
another
foster
family
or
to
an
institution,
and
sometimes
it
is
a
transfer
for
purposes
of
adoption;
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
right
and
that
new
york
law
does
after
a
child
has
been
18
months
or
more
in
a
foster
family.
unknown
speaker
it
gives
some
rights
at
least
to
be
heard
or
be
heard
from
to
the
foster
parents,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
is
it
clear
in
new
york
as
to
whether
the
foster
parent
or
who
has
loco
parentis
over
the
child?
unknown
speaker
that
i
understand.
but
who
determines
what
the
child
shall
do,
like
who
does
what
a
parent
would
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
the
authorized
agency
take
care
of
the
day-by-day
care
of
the
child?
unknown
speaker
once
again,
who
is
in
the
parental
position
day
by
day
and,
since
you
pushed
me,
hour
by
hour?
it
is
the
foster
parent,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
delegated
from.
unknown
speaker
is
it
fundamentally
different
from
the
arrangement
made
when
people
take
their
children
and
put
them
in
a
summer
camp
for
three
months
except
that
is
a
longer
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask,
on
page
20
of
the
brief
of
the
new
york
city
appellants,
it
is
said
that
ssc
procedure
no.
5
is
this...
unknown
speaker
now,
it
says
that
under
this
procedure
instituted
in
1974,
a
foster
parent
may
request
a
full
trial-type
hearing
before
removal.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
thought
that's
what
this
case
was
all
about
and
it
goes
on
to
say
between
august
1974
and
june
1976,
only
26
foster
parents
requested
hearings.
unknown
speaker
now,
were
these
foster
parents
in
new
york
city
or
not?
unknown
speaker
did
they
have
the
right
or
didn’t
they
to
request
this
full
trial-type
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
were
they
granted
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the
district
court
order?
unknown
speaker
with
or
without
a
request.
unknown
speaker
the
state
of
new
york
is
well
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
any
foster
parent
who
has
this
kind
of
a
right
hasn’t
too
much
to
complain
about,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
that
is
new
york
city.
unknown
speaker
outside
of
new
york
city,
it's
the
ten-day
notice;
but
then
in
the
sit-down
sort
of
discussion
if
the
foster
parent
wants
to
talk
about
it.
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
foster
parent
wants
to
come
in
and
talk
about
it,
they
will
listen.
unknown
speaker
in
a
sense,
it's
sort
of
a
neglect
proceeding,
or
they
would
be
talking
about
the
neglect
of
the
parents?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
in
new
york
city,
this
right
to
a
hearing
begins
at
the
initiative
of
foster
parents
is
applicable
no
matter
how
long
the
child
has
been
in
the
foster
home,
or
does
that
have
to
have
been
18
months?
unknown
speaker
any
time
there
is
a
proposed
removal.
unknown
speaker
as
opposed
to
returning
to
the
natural
parents.
unknown
speaker
however
short
or
long
a
time
the
child
has
been
in
the
foster
home.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
just
from
one
foster
parent
to
another
foster
parent,
or
is
it
also
from
a
foster
parent
back
to
the
natural
parents?
unknown
speaker
how
about
or
for
adoption?
unknown
speaker
well,
whatever
you
or
i
might
think,
i
mean
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
no
one
wants
them?
unknown
speaker
tell
us
that
again.
unknown
speaker
tell
us
that
again,
will
you,
please?
unknown
speaker
but
the
ten-day
notice
and
the
sit-down
discussion
is
available.
unknown
speaker
that's
by
statute,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
supposing
that
over
a
span
of
several
years
it's
deemed
by
the
social
service
agency
neither
desirable
to
reunite
the
child
with
its
natural
parent
nor
to
place
it
for
its
adoption.
would
it
be
normal
in
that
situation
for
the
child
to
remain
with
only
one
foster
parent,
or
might
there
be
more
than
one
foster
parent
involved?
unknown
speaker
but
don’t
situations
arise
where
there
is
disharmony
between
a
particular
foster
child
and
a
particular
foster
parent
so
that
there
is
a
change
in
foster
placement,
even
though
there
is
no
adoption?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
a
practical
manner,
if
you
know,
is
that
because
the
foster
parents
find
this
child
is
a
problem
child
and
they
are
not
able
to
cope
for
it.
is
that
generally
the...?
unknown
speaker
what
percentage?
unknown
speaker
over
80.
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily
with
the
same
family.
unknown
speaker
ms.
lowry,
does
the
record
show
why
the
state
decided
in
a
typical
case
or
in
a
certain
percentage
of
cases
or
however
it
might
show
it
to
remove
a
foster
child
from
one
foster-care
setting
to
another?
unknown
speaker
does
the
new
york
have
a
policy
with
respect
to
adoptions
by
unmarried
people?
this
woman
is
a
widow,
you
say.
unknown
speaker
and
does
new
york
have
a
policy
about
allowing
individuals
to
adopt?
unknown
speaker
ms.
lowry,
i
have
a
problem.
maybe
you
can
help
me.
we
have
a
child
who
is
in
foster
family
a
who
is
about
to
be
transferred
to
foster
family
b.
how
can
you
represent
both
family
a
and
family
b,
who
are
both
foster
parents?
unknown
speaker
do
you
represent
both?
unknown
speaker
so,
you're
representing
a
and
b.
unknown
speaker
well,
yeah,
by
procedure;
but
who
is
going
to
draw
up
the
standards
or
the
rules?
is
that
going
to
be
a
federal
rule
that
the
court
should
impose?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
state
standard
has
already
been
enforced
in
these
cases.
the
agencies
have
decided
that
the
children
are
to
be
returned
to
the
home
with
respect
to
under
the
state
rules.
unknown
speaker
but
in
any
event,
in
any
of
these
situations,
by
the
time
that
they've
decided
the
child
is
to
be
returned,
the
state
standard
presumably
has
been
satisfied
in
the
eyes
of
the
agency.
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
is
all
the
federal
court
going
to
do
or
is
all
a
trial-type
hearing
going
to
do
is
to
make
sure
that
that
standard
has
been
applied.
is
that
all?
unknown
speaker
thus,
the
controlling
standard
is
going
to
remain
the
state
standard,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so
if
there
is
a
proposed
transfer
from
foster
home
a
to
foster
home
b,
the
procedure
which
you
contemplate
means
that
foster
home
a
would
be
represented
by
counsel,
foster
home
b
would
be
represented
by
a
different
counsel,
the
children
would
be
represented
by
a
third
counsel
and
the
state
by
a
fourth
counsel?
unknown
speaker
but
would
there
be
lawyers
at
these
hearings?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
is
the
hearing
the
district
court
ordered
any
different
than
the
one
the
state
conducts
now?
unknown
speaker
take
them
both.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
new
york
city
area?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
below,
as
i
understand
it,
held
that
the
foster
parents
themselves,
whom
you
represent,
did
not
have
a
constitutionally
protected
interest.
unknown
speaker
but
they
gave
it
purportedly
at
the
behest
of
the
children.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
based
upon
an
identification
of
a
deprivation
of
the
children’s
liberty,
because
as
we
all
know,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
even
invoked
until
or
unless
the
state
deprives
somebody
of
life,
liberty
or
property.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
as
to
the
primary
inquiry,
therefore
has
somebody
been
deprived
by
the
state
of
life,
liberty
or
property;
and
that
primary
inquiry
was
answered
here
by
the
three-judge
district
court,
yes,
the
children
have
been
deprived
of
liberty
by
the
state.
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
then
and
only
then
do
we
look
to
see
what
procedural,
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
due-process
clause
of
procedural
protection,
what
does
it
require
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
question
that
the
district
court
answered.
unknown
speaker
there
is
arguably
a
property
interest
that
has
been
deprived
of
the
foster
parents
here,
since
they
do
get
paid,
don't
they?
they
have
a
statutory
entitlement
to
be
paid
by
that
state
so
long
as
the
child
is
in
their
home,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
defeasible
as
a
matter
of
contract,
is
that
what
the...
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
contractually
defeasible
at
the
will
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
ms.
lowry;
when
the
children
were
put
in
the
foster
home,
there
was
no
hearing.
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
automatically
get
a
hearing,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
automatically;
i
mean,
without
consent
or
anything.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
put
it
another
way.
they
did
not
force
the
hearing
on
them,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
children
lost
that
liberty
then,
didn’t
they,
without
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
and
then,
when
they
get
on
to
a
foster
parent,
they
get
more
rights
than
they
had
when
they
were
with
their
biological
parents?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
the
same
to
me.
unknown
speaker
first,
they
took
them
away
from
their
own
parents
without
a
hearing
for
the
children.
the
children
did
not
get
a
hearing,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
far
as
the
children
were
concerned,
nobody
paid
anything
about
that
at
all
so
far
as
a
full-blown
hearing
was
concerned.
now,
you're
going
to
give
the
foster
parents
more
rights
than
the
biological
parents
had.
unknown
speaker
where
am
i
wrong
on
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
am
i
correct,
or
do
i
read
the
opinion
wrong?
under
this
opinion,
i
think
if
a
foster
parent
says,
"i
think
that
child
ought
to
be
transferred",
you
still
have
to
have
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
read
it
differently.
unknown
speaker
well,
we'll
read
it
again.
unknown
speaker
the
order
or
the
opinion?
unknown
speaker
is
the
opinion
all
that
clear
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
do
the
children
ever
get
in
on
these
hearings?
are
they
personally
present?
unknown
speaker
any
hearings.
any
of
these
hearings.
unknown
speaker
ms.
lowry,
what
about
the
hearings
ordered
by
the
district
court?
is
the
interest
of
the
child
to
be
represented
at
the
hearing
and,
if
so,
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
critical
if
the
child’s
liberty
interest
triggers
the
whole
process?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
have
a
child
three
or
four
years
old,
at
least
when
these
start,
you
would
have
to
appoint
an
adult
representative
in
every
case.
unknown
speaker
which
i
take
it
would
also
mean
that
no
one
could
waive
the
right
to
a
hearing
so
that
we
would
have
to
have
a
hearing
before
every
transfer.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
the
correct
decision
that
we
should
reach?
unknown
speaker
why
should
it
matter
if
the
foster
parent
requested
the
removal?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
though?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
must
locate
an
adult
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
child,
what
kind
of
delays
do
you
think
will
always
be
involved?
unknown
speaker
how
big
is
it?
unknown
speaker
a
thousand
transfers?
unknown
speaker
and
a
thousand
hearings
and
in
the
district
court’s
judgment,
a
thousand
hearings.
unknown
speaker
ms.
lowry,
your
argument,
which
i
gather
was
accepted
by
the
district
court,
was
that
the
foster-family
relationship
is
akin
in
its
protected
status
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
biological
family,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
not
that
it
was
identical,
but
that
that
was
the
basis
for
it.
unknown
speaker
now,
if
you
had
a
biological
family
where
the
father
and
mother
said,
"we're
tired
of
having
this
natural
kid
around,
we're
going
to
take
him
over
to
the
local
institution
and
dump
him
there".
would
you
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
that
dumping
was
to
occur
at
the
initiative
of
the
parents
eliminated
any
requirement
for
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
state
action;
the
due-process
clause
isn't
applicable.
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
recipient.
it
is
not
the
government
that's
dumping
the
child;
it
is
private
people.
the
due-process
clause
is
inapplicable.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
is
it
different
in
the
case
of
foster
parents?
why
if
they
initiate
the
"dumping"
may
be
unartful
word,
but
i
think
it
conveys
the
expression
--
should
there
be
no
hearing.
but
if
they
object
to
it,
there
is
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
isn't
asserting
any
claim
to
a
special
hearing
here.
it's
satisfied
with
what
it
had
before
your
lawsuit
was
brought.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
so
as
a
matter
of
policy;
but
getting
back
to
the
first
preliminary
inquiry,
in
any
procedural
due-process
case
must
be
an
effort
to
identify
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
deprivation
of
life,
liberty
or
property.
now,
here,
the
district
said
surely
there
was
no
deprivation
of
life
in
this
case,
so
set
that
aside.
the
district
court
found
no
deprivation
of
property.
the
district
court
did
find
a
deprivation
of
the
child’s
liberty,
the
foster
child’s
liberty.
how
would
you
identify
the
foster
child’s
liberty
that's
being
deprived
in
this
case,
in
other
words?
unknown
speaker
i
am
interested
in
the
description
of
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
no,
let's
talk
about
liberty,
because
let's
talk
about
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
talks
about.
unknown
speaker
life,
liberty
or
property.
unknown
speaker
and
we've
eliminated
two
of
them,
and
we're
left
with
liberty.
now,
what
liberty
of
the
child
is
being
taken
away?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn’t
talk
about
--
let's
try
to
answer
my
question
first,
and
then
you
can
explain
all
you
want.
unknown
speaker
has
that
ever
been
identified
as
a
liberty
before
in
any
other
case
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
the
child’s
liberty,
or
has
it
been
the
parents',
the
natural
parents'?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
armstrong
v.
manzo,
too;
but
that
involved
a
parent's
interest,
the
natural
parent’s
interest.
this
is
a
foster
child’s
liberty
interest,
and
i'm
interested
in
how
you
would
describe
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
has
this
court
ever
identified
any
such
liberty?
unknown
speaker
the
natural
parents,
yes.
unknown
speaker
that's
in
stanley
v.
illinois,
armstrong
v.
manzo
and,
i
'm
sure,
other
cases.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
if
they're
put
in
jail,
they
have
an
interest
in
not
being
put
in
jail
and
if
they're
a
child,
they
could
have
all
kinds
of
liberty
interests.
unknown
speaker
as
my
brother
stevens
suggested
in
a
question
a
few
moments
ago,
if
the
foster
child
does
have
this
liberty
interest
which
is
constitutionally
protected
by
the
procedural
due
process
accorded
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
why
isn’t
that
interest
protected
if
the
foster
parents
don't
want
him
in
the
home?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
still
the
same
liberty
interest
if
it
is
the
child’s
interest,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
why
on
earth
did
the
district
court
say
that
no
hearing
is
required
if
the
foster
parents
don't
want
him
in
the
home?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
think
it
did?
why
do
you
think
the
district
court
did
if
the
liberty
interest
was
the
kind
of
interest
you're
describing?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
liberty
interest,
i
guess
our
description
ought
to
be
narrowed
somewhat.
it's
an
interest
in
remaining
in
a
willing
foster
parent’s
home.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
think
is
defective
about
the
present
procedures
of
ten
days'
notice
and
then
a
sit-down
conference?
isn’t
there
an
opportunity
for
a
sit-down,
at
least
a
conversation
with
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
and
can
the
foster
parents
bring
any
information
they
have
there?
unknown
speaker
are
they
ever
told?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
that
under
state
law
that
when
a
parent
voluntarily
turns
over
his
child
to
the
state
to
place
in
a
foster
home?
do
you
agree
that
the
understanding
is
or
the
state
law
is
that
the
parent
has
the
right
to
have
the
child
back
upon
request?
unknown
speaker
by
the
way,
what
standard
do
you
think
the
agency
in
new
york
applies
now
when
after
a
year
there's
a
removal
from
a
foster
home
proposed
and
they
give
the
foster
parent
notice?
what
standard
do
you
think
the
agency
is
applying
in
deciding
to
remove
the
child
to
return
it
to
the
parent?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
applied,
do
you
find
it
in
the
statute
or
in
the
regulation?
where
do
you
find
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
far
as
the
standard
is
concerned,
that
is
all
right
with
you,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be;
but
you
would
not
suggest
that
the
standard
be
changed.
unknown
speaker
is
the
agency
decision
in
new
york
subject
to
any
kind
of
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
and
then
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
district
court
would
require
that
the
full
trial-type
hearing
prior
to
removal
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
unknown
speaker
ms.
lowry,
could
i
just
put
this
other
side
of
the
problem
to
you
for
a
moment?
supposing
the
agency
adopted
a
rule
that
in
a
single
foster-parent
situation
--
ms.
smith
was
a
53-year-old
widow.
a
single
parent
over
52
or
53
years
old
suffering
from
a
severe
illness
of
some
kind
such
as
arthritis
should
not
in
the
normal
case
retain
custody
of
the
child
such
as
this.
would
such
a
rule
be
arbitrary?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
were
adopted
as
agency
policy
and
you
impose
the
hearing,
who
shall
decide
whether
or
not
the
policy
should
apply
in
a
he
given
case?
it
is
going
to
be
an
employee
of
the
agency,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
who
is
this
independent
decision-maker?
that's
the
question
i
was
getting
at.
what
does
the
constitution
require
with
respect
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
shall
decide
whether
or
not
to
apply
the
policy?
unknown
speaker
but
where
does
the
constitution
require
that?
why
isn’t
it
perhaps
wiser
to
have
a
person
who
has
some
background
with
the
family
and
the
child
and
all
the
rest
making
the
decision?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
with
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
why
does
that
disqualify
a
person
otherwise
independent,
having
no
financial
interest,
no
interest
other
than
the
wellbeing
of
the
child?
unknown
speaker
ms.
lowry,
i
am
still
in
trouble.
is
this
person
a
person
outside
of
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
i'm
talking
about
the
one
you
want.
will
you
settle
for
that?
unknown
speaker
the
only
one
you
want
is
somebody
that
didn’t
handle
this
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
man
and
woman
at
the
conference
such
a
person?
unknown
speaker
at
the
conference
itself.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
settle
if
it
was
another
equivalent
person
--
for
example,
somebody
had
another
authorized
case,
but
didn't
have
this
one.
unknown
speaker
you'd
be
satisfied.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
want
to
overhaul
the
whole
social
services.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
these
arguments
go
to
what
kind
of
piece
of
legislation
the
state
of
new
york
ought
to
have
dealing
with
this
sensitive
subject.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i
can't
understand
is
that
they
are
going
to
--
unknown
speaker
who
are
you
representing,
the
interests
of
the
children
or
the
foster
parents?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
were
just
speaking
about
the
children’s
rights.
i
thought
your
friend
was
representing
their
interests
and
the
state's.
unknown
speaker
ms.
lowry,
could
i
ask
another
question?
the
foster
parents'
status
as
having
authority
to
receive
foster
children
is
something
that's
renewed
periodically,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
does
the
child
have
any
right
to
protest
the
withdrawal
of
a
license
of
a
foster
home?
unknown
speaker
this
could
happen,
could
it
not,
for
example,
if
they
might
adopt
a
rule
that
no
one
over
50
years
of
age
with
arthritis
can
be
a
foster
parent?
unknown
speaker
and
without
any
notice
or
a
hearing
to
a
child
who
might
be
affected
by
such
a
decision.
unknown
speaker
but
the
logic
of
the
district
court’s
opinion
would
seem
to
require
that
the
child
whose
liberty
was
going
to
be
deprived
by
the
laws
of
license
by
the
foster
family
would
be
the
party
interested
in
such
a
hearing.
unknown
speaker
constitutionally.
unknown
speaker
and
he
or
she
would
have
a
right
to
procedural
due
process
accorded
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
before
new
york
could
cancel
a
license
of
a
foster
parent...
unknown
speaker
his
or
her
foster
parent.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
appellees'
argument
that
there
is
no
liberty
interest
or
that
if
there
is
one
all
the
process
that
is
due
is
being
afforded?
unknown
speaker
does
this
case
only
involve
cases
where
the
natural
parent
wants
the
children
back?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
a
natural
parent
isn't
involved
and
it's
just
the
state
has
decided
to
change
the
custody?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
anybody
could
complain
at
all
if
new
york
decided,
well,
we've
been
giving
too
much
due
process
here.
we
are
going
to
discontinue
foster
care
at
the
discretion
of
the
agencies
without
any
hearing,
without
any
notice,
without
any
sit-down
discussion,
without
any
trial-type
hearing
at
all,
and
not
subject
to
any
judicial
review
whatsoever.
we're
just
going
to
transfer
the
children.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
said
let's
assume
new
york
decides
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
they
are
providing
it,
and
they
are
going
to
make,
say,
2,000
transfers
a
year
in
new
york
city
from
one
foster
family
to
another
and
without
any
hearing,
without
any
notice,
without
explaining
anything
at
all
and
without
any
judicial
review.
now,
you
would
say
they
could
do
that,
because
there
is
no
liberty
interest
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
that
state
could
without
any
notice
whatsoever
and
without
any
hearing
terminate
the
parents’
rights
once
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
is
because
why?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
child's
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
child
himself
would
have
an
interest
in
that
interest?
do
you
think
the
child
would
have
standing?
unknown
speaker
so
you
agree
that
the
child
certainly
has
a
liberty
interest
in
remaining
with
his
natural
family.
unknown
speaker
but
not
with
respect
to
remaining
with
any
foster
family.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
parents
are
dead,
and
the
state
has
custody
of
the
child.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
anyone
have
standing
--
would
anybody
have
any
kind
of
standing
whatsoever
or
any
interest
that
you
would
recognize
to
question
the
state's
decision
in
terminating
a
particular
foster
parent?
unknown
speaker
and
in
what
court?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
the
united
states
district
court.
