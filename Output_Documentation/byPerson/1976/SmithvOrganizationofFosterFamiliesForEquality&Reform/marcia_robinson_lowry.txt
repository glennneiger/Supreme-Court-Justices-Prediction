ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
foster
parents,
who
were
plaintiffs
below
and
who
are
appellees
today
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself
specifically
to
some
of
the
statements
that
have
been
made
by
the
appellant,
and
i
would
like
to
try
and
give
the
court
some
understanding
of
the
factual
context
in
which
the
district
court
decided
this
decision.
we
have
heard
about
the
natural
parents.
indeed,
natural-parent
relationships
have
always
been
accorded
primary
protection
by
this
court,
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
the
record
below
shows
that
80%
of
the
children
who
were
removed
from
foster
homes
in
new
york
state
after
living
in
the
foster
home
for
a
year
or
more
were
removed
for
a
placement
in
another
foster-care
setting;
that
is,
children
were
going
to
be
moved
either
to
another
foster
home,
or
they
were
going
to
be
moved
to
an
institution
of
some
sort.
they
were
not
going
back
to
their
biological
families.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
over
80%.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
your
honor;
13%
of
those
children
went
back
to
the
biological
family,
7%
went
into
adoption.
that's
what
is
going
on
the
foster-care
system,
and
that
is
the
system
with
which
the
new
york
district
court
was
dealing.
the
length
of
time
of
children
in
foster
care
in
new
york
state
has,
unfortunately,
increased.
at
the
time
that
the
district
court
reached
its
decision,
it
found
that
children
were
in
care
an
average
of
4½
years;
it
is
now
over
5
years.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
right,
your
honor;
that's
right.
the
only
statistics
with
regard
to
children
being
removed
from
foster
homes
in
which
they
have
lived
for
a
year
or
more
were
furnished
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
and
from
the
state
defendants
in
response
to
interrogatories.
those
are
the
only
statistics,
and
it
shows
that
most
of
these
children,
80%
of
these
children,
are
going
elsewhere
in
the
foster-care
system.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
show
that;
but
i
would
like
to
describe
to
the
court
the
situation
of
the
foster
family
that
initially
brought
this
lawsuit.
i
think
it
is
very
illustrative.
ms.
madeleine
smith
is
a
widow,
who
has
been
a
foster
family
with
a
new
york
city
agency
now
since
1970.
the
two
children
who
were
placed
with
her
were
two
and
four
years
old
when
they
were
in
placed
with
her
in
1970.
they
had
not
been
placed
as
the
result
of
court
adjudication
against
the
natural
parents.
the
natural
parents
had,
in
fact,
left
the
children
with
a
neighbor,
and
so
that
was
considered
a
voluntary
placement.
those
children
were
with
ms.
smith
for
four
years,
and
ms.
smith
repeatedly
expressed
her
desire
to
adopt
those
children.
she,
in
fact,
thought
they
were
free
for
adoption,
because
the
natural
parents
had
never
visited
those
children.
after
four
years,
the
agency
workers
changed,
as
is
the
case
usually
in
new
york
city;
typically,
the
record
shows,
three
or
four
or
five
workers
will
be
involved
in
one
foster-care
situation.
all
of
the
named
foster
parents
had
several
workers,
never
the
same
worker.
the
new
worker
came
on
the
case,
and
the
new
worker
decided
that
these
two
children
should
be
removed
from
ms.
smith’s
home,
because
ms.
smith
had
arthritis,
which
is
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
she
is
a
widow,
your
honor.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
policy
is
that
single
parents
can
adopt
in
new
york
city,
and
single-parent
adoptions
do
take
place,
even
with
unmarried
people.
ms.
smith
is,
as
you
know,
a
widow,
and
ms.
smith
has
been
trying
repeatedly
to
adopt
these
children.
ms.
smith
is
the
only
permanent
home
these
children
are
ever
going
to
have.
nevertheless,
an
agency
worker
decided
that
the
children
should
be
removed.
ms.
smith
had
no
kind
of
right
to
a
hearing,
nor
did
these
children.
these
children
faced
the
loss
of
the
only
family
they
had
ever
known.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
your
honor,
what
we
are
representing
in
this
case
is
that
there
should
be
a
hearing,
that
the
decision-making
process
should
be
constitutionally
adequate.
at
the
hearing
itself,
surely
counsel
for
foster
parent
a
could
not
represent
foster
family
b.
but
what
the
foster
parent
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
your
honor,
we
are
representing
the
foster
family’s
interest
in
a
constitutionally
adequate
decision-making
process.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
we
are
representing
the
principle
that
there
should
be
a
decision-making
process
that
is
constitutionally
adequate,
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
conflict
between
foster
family
a
and
foster
family
b.
surely,
foster
family
b
has
no
interest
in
having
the
child
that
is
coming
to
them
unnecessarily
traumatized
by
a
removal
from
a
home
that
is
a
valuable
home
to
that
child.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
conflicting
interest
there
at
all.
all
this
case
is
about
and
all
the
foster
parents
are
interested
in
is
that
the
child’s
interests
be
protected
in
the
decision-making
process
by
a
constitutionally
adequate
procedure.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
your
honor.
the
district
court
below
specifically
said
that
the
federal
court
was
only
setting
forth
the
need
for
a
procedure
at
which
state
standards
could
be
effectively
applied.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
your
honor.
excuse
me,
but
the
state
standard
varies.
when
a
child
is
going
to
go
back
to
a
natural
family,
there
is
one
standard,
which
the
federal
court
did
not
deal
with,
and
when
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
agency
thinks
it
has
applied
the
state
standard
presumably.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
federal
court
ordered
that
the
decision
be
made
with
all
of
the
information
before
it,
and
it
found
that
the
procedure
that
presently
exists
was
not
adequate.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that's
right,
your
honor.
there
was
absolutely
no
tampering
with
the
state
standard.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
your
honor.
what
the
district
court
ordered
was
simply
that
there
be
some
sort
of
a
hearing
held
so
that
all
information
that
was
relevant
could
be
presented
to
an
administrative
decision-maker.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
not
necessarily.
the
district
court
specifically
did
not
deal
with
that
and
said,
in
fact,
there
is
no
requirement
that
counsel
be
available
to
represent
these
parties.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
your
honor,
you
are
referring
to
the
new
york
city
procedure
or
the
conference
that
the
district
court
found
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
all
right.
with
regard
to
the
conference
that
the
district
court
found
unconstitutional,
the
problem
with
that
conference
was,
number
one,
the
decision-maker
had
been
involved
in
the
decision
to
begin
with.
number
two,
the
agency
as
in
the
case
of
new
york
city
that
had
made
the
decision
need
not
be
present.
number
three,
the
foster
parent
who
was
coming
in
to
contest
the
decision
did
not
necessarily
know
the
reason
for
removal.
the
record
shows
that
in
some
instances,
the
foster
parent
isn't
even
told,
because
the
agency
may
consider
it
wise
to
withhold
the
information;
and
number
two,
it's
undisputed
that
the
notice
that
the
foster
parent
receives
under
the
procedure
declared
unconstitutional
contained
no
information
whatsoever;
and
number
three,
the
foster
parents
had
no
right
to
present
any
kind
of
witnesses.
all
they
had
was
the
opportunity
to
come
in
and
explain
to
the
decision-maker
already
involved
in
the
decision
why
the
decision
was
wrong
without
knowing
the
basis
for
the
decision.
in
addition,
if
the
agency
had
based
the
decision
on
any
kind
of
documentary
information,
the
foster
parent
who
came
in
to
contest
that
had
no
right
to
know
what
that
was.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
new
york
city
procedure
is
a
substantial
improvement
over
that,
it
applies
only
to
new
york
city,
as
the
court
is
aware,
and
it
does
not
apply
to
the
return-of-home
situation.
the
court
below
found
that
the
new
york
city
procedure
was
inadequate,
because
it
was
dependent
upon
the
foster
parent
triggering
the
hearing
when
it
was
the
child’s
interests
that
the
court
was
concerned
with
protecting.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
they
reached
only
one
of
the
foster
parents’
claims.
they
found
that
the
foster
parents
had
no
constitutionally
protected
property
interest
in
the
foster-parent
relationship.
they
did
not
reach
the
foster
parents'
liberty,
interest
or
equal-protection
claims.
they
found
it
unnecessary,
because
they
gave
the
hearing
that
the
foster
parents
were
concerned
with
and,
in
fact,
the
foster
parents
got
the
relief
they
asked
for.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that's
correct,
it
was
based
solely
on
the
children’s
constitutional
right,
and
the
foster
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
indeed
the
basis.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
what
it
was
limited
to.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
correct,
the
district
court
rejected
that.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
the
district
court
rejected
that
and
found
that
there
was
no
expectation
of
the
continuation
of
the
relationship.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that’s
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
they
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
natural
parent
had
a
right
to
a
hearing.
the
natural
parent
either
consented
to
the
child
coming
into
the
foster
home
or
could
object,
and
there
was
a
full
hearing
available
in
the
family
court,
that's
right.
there
was
no
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
they
did
if
they
did
not
consent.
they
either
had
a
hearing
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
right.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
they
did
not.
they
consented,
they,
unlike
children
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
they
certainly
did.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
your
honor,
either
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
either
--
not
exactly.
not
exactly.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
i
will
explain
to
you
why
it
is
not.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
your
honor,
they
did
not
take
them
away
from
their
own
parents;
their
parents
either
gave
them
up
or,
if
there
was
a
hearing,
the
children
were
represented
at
the
hearing
by
counsel.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
your
honor,
we
are
only
going
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
where
you
were
wrong
is
that
if
the
state
has
an
obligation
not
to
agree
to
have
the
parents
give
up
the
children
unless
the
parent
has
a
reason
for
doing
that.
if
a
parent
comes
into
the
state
and
says,
"i
don't
like
my
child
today;
please
take
my
child",
the
state
will
not
take
that
child.
if
the
parent
wants
to
put
the
child
in
and
there
is
no
reason
for
it,
then
the
child
cannot
be
put
in.
on
the
other
hand,
so
the
parent
has
to
affirmatively
say,
"i
can't
deal
with
my
child",
and
the
state
has
to
look
and
see
that
the
parent,
in
fact,
cannot.
and
if
the
parent
then
agrees
to
put
the
child
in,
then
there
is
no
hearing;
however,
if
the
state
comes
to
the
parent
and
says,
"i
want
to
take
your
child",
and
the
parent
says,
"i'd
rather
you
didn't",
then
there
is
a
full-blown
hearing,
at
which
the
child
is
separately
represented
in
new
york
by
a
law
guardian,
who
may
say
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
your
honor.
the
order
specifically
exempts
that
situation.
the
order
applies
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
am
speaking
of
the
order.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
but
the
order
specifically
exempts
that
and
of
course
exempts
the
situation
in
which
some
court
has
ruled.
now,
i
wanted
to
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
in
which
hearings?
the
one
that...
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
children
are
generally
not
personally
present.
if
there
is
a
court
hearing
of
some
sort,
the
judge
may
often
question
the
child
in
chambers;
but
the
child
does
not
usually
actually
participate
as
a
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
district
court
contemplated
that
the
child's
interest
would
be
represented
and
that
the
child
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
must
say,
it's
not
exactly
clear
from
the
order.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
believe
that
it
is,
and
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
court
contemplated
that
either
the
child
would
participate
in
the
hearing
if
the
child
were
old
enough
or
that
an
adult
representative
would
be
appointed
to
represent
the
child’s
interests
at
the
hearing.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
right.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
think
that
it
is
the
correct
decision
under
the
circumstances
that
the
district
court
limited
in
its
order;
that
is,
i
think
that
there
should
be
hearing
when
the
child
has
been
in
for
a
year
or
more
and
is
going
anyplace,
and
the
foster
parent
has
not
requested
the
removal.
i
think
that
some
hearings
can
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
i
think
that
that
was
simply
a
practical
consideration.
i
think
that
if
a
foster
parent
feels
that
the
child
cannot
stay
with
the
foster
parent
any
longer,
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
try
and
impose
that.
but
on
the
other
hand
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
it's
hard
to
contemplate
a
situation
in
which
it
would
be
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
stay
with
people
that
had
asked
the
child
be
taken.
but
i
believe
your
concern
is
why
the
court
required
a
hearing
in
all
other
situations;
that
is,
the
foster
parent
may
be
silent,
and
it
may
be
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
stay
there.
and
so
the
district
court
in
those
situations
directed
that
a
hearing
be
held.
it
is
quite
obvious
that
at
some
of
these
hearings,
the
hearing
may
be
very,
very
brief
and
fairly
pro
forma
if
there
is
a
very
good
reason
for
the
hearing
and
for
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
think
that
the
district
court
directed
that
procedures
be
formulated,
and
i
think
the
procedures
can
easily
be
formulated
which
will
allow
this
to
go
forward
within
a
ten-day
time
period.
i
think
that
there
is
no
problem
with
that
and
i
think
also
the
court
should
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
despite
the
fact
we've
heard
about
thousands
and
thousands
of
hearings,
in
fact,
that
is
not
the
case.
the
record
shows
that
the
number
of
transfers
at
which
the
hearing
would
apply
is
not
as
great,
and
we
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
there
were
1500
transfers
from
1973
to
1974
of
those
children
who
had
been
in
a
foster
home
for
a
year
or
more.
the
city
estimates
that
approximately
one-third
of
those
transfers
are
at
the
foster
parents'
request;
therefore,
they
would
be
exempted.
so
what
we're
talking
about
at
this
is
a
thousand
hearings
a
year
and
i
think
in
addition
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
we
are
talking
about
a
thousand
transfers
that
have
not
been
at
the
foster
parents'
request.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
right,
your
honor.
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
do
not
know
exactly
how
many
of
these
transfers
would
take
place
if
there
were
some
sort
of
procedure
that
required
the
agencies
to
justify
the
hearing.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
it
was
akin
to
it.
the
district
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
i
wouldn't
necessarily
think
that,
your
honor.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
if
the
agency
that
is
taking
the
child
is
taking
the
child
to
place
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
then
that's
the
answer
to
the
question,
perhaps.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
think
that
that
is
simply
grounded
in
the
reality
of
the
fact
that
it
is
very
hard
to
--
first
of
all,
the
state
is
interfering
here,
the
state
is
sanctioning
the
removal,
and
this
child
is
in
the
custody
of
the
state.
this
child
remains
in
the
custody
of
the
state,
and
so
the
state
has
a
continuing
concern
in
this
child’s
life.
however,
if
the
facility,
the
home
that
the
state
has
provided
for
the
child,
no
longer
wants
to
take
care
of
the
child,
it
is
very
hard
to
imagine
that
the
state
can
require
that.
someone
asked
a
question
about
whether
or
not
this
was
the
same
as
putting
the
child
in
summer
camp
or
a
boarding
school.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
is
not,
and
i
do
not
think
that
analogy
can
be
made.
the
foster
family
is
the
best
substitute
that
there
is
for
a
natural-family
home.
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
it
is
best
for
a
child
to
remain
in
a
natural
family
where
the
relationship
is
a
viable
one
and
the
child
is
not
being
harmed.
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
these
are
children
who
have
been
out
for
a
year
or
more,
and
the
reason
that
the
state
has
put
the
child
in
the
foster
home
is
because
the
state
expects
not
just
that
the
child
is
going
to
be
housed
and
fed
and
not
left
to
roam
the
streets
at
night,
but
because
the
child
is
going
to
have
a
family
relationship.
and
in
fact,
the
foster
family
is
the
most
likely
family
to
adopt
a
child
if
a
child
later
is
adopted.
for
example,
ms.
smith
is
now
in
the
process
of
trying
to
adopt
the
foster
children
that
have
been
with
her
since
1970.
most
of
the
adoptions
in
new
york
state
of
foster
children
are
done
by
foster
families.
so
it
is
not
merely
a
custodial
relationship.
the
state
has,
therefore,
a
very
great
interest;
contrary
to
simply
disrupting
the
relationship
arbitrarily,
a
great
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
decision
to
remove
the
child
is
made
under
constitutionally
adequate
procedures
where
everyone,
including
the
child,
has
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
indeed
it
is,
your
honor.
indeed
it
is,
and
in
fact,
it
raises
as
support
for
its
position
meachum
v.
fano,
a
situation
in
which
the
right
of
the
state
to
transfer
a
person
from
one
prison
facility
to
another
was
upheld.
and
we
are
saying
that
there
is
a
conflict
here
between
the
interests
of
the
child
and
the
state’s
assertion,
because
we
believe
that
the
state
should
be
concerned
about
whether
these
decisions
are
being
made
with
all
of
the
information
available.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
all
right,
i
think
it
stems
from
several
sources,
and
i
will
tell
you
what
they
are.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
all
right.
the
child
is
being
condemned
to
suffer
grievous
loss
without
being
heard.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
alright,
the
fourteenth
amendment
talks
about
certain
areas
in
which
the
state
may
not
interfere
arbitrarily,
and
one
of
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that's
right,
and
we
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
we
are
talking
about
the
liberty
of
the
child
in
the
foster-family
relationship.
one
of
the
zones
of
privacy
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
held
to
protect
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
it
is
the
child’s
interest
in
the
family
relationship,
your
honor.
that's
a
liberty
interest.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
family
relationship
has
repeatedly
been
identified
as
a
liberty
interest.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
there
has
never
been
a
conflict
between
parent
and
child
before;
but
in
stanley
v.
illinois,
the
court
spoke
about
the
family
relationship,
both
from
the
standpoint
of
the
father
and
from
the
standpoint
of
the
child.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
there
has
not
been
a
case
in
which
this
has
specifically
been
held.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that,
but
the
child
has
a
liberty
interest
in
the
relationship,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
found
to
be
a
protected
relationship.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
this
court
has
identified
the
liberty
interest
in
family
relationships
from
the
standpoint,
as
you
say,
of
the
natural
family.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
natural
parents,
that's
right.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that's
right.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
court
would
limit
that
only
to
the
natural
parent
and
not
have
the
right
flow
two
ways.
children
have
been
held
to
have
liberty
interests
in
other
situations.
that
is
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
they
also
have
an
interest
in
not
being
arbitrarily
suspended
from
school,
both
based
on
their
property
interest
and
their
liberty
interest
and
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
fifth
circuit
just
a
month
ago
in
a
decision
yet
unreported
found
a
liberty
interest
both
from
simply
the
foster
parent
and
the
foster
child
in
an
analogous
situation,
citing
this
case.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
i
think
that
as
a
reasonable
matter
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
your
honor,
and
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
your
honor,
this
court
could,
of
course,
modify
the
decision
in
that
respect.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
district
court
did
it
after
submission
of
affidavits
by
the
city
defendants,
in
which
they
made
a
policy
argument
that
there
was
no
need
to
have
a
hearing
and
it
would
be
counterproductive
to
have
a
hearing
in
a
situation
in
which
foster
parents
were
requesting
the
removal
and
that,
in
fact,
it
might
be
destructive
to
a
child
to
require
the
child
to
stay
there
during
the
hearing
process
when
the
foster
family
had
affirmatively
asked
that
the
child
to
leave.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
district
court
exempting
that.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
right,
your
honor,
in
which
there
is
a
relationship
that
could
be
protected
there.
i'd
like
to
also
address
myself
to
another
question
that
you
raised
earlier,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
state
court
review
process
is
in
effect
when
a
child
is
being
removed
from
a
foster
home.
it
is
not.
the
state
court
review
process
is
a
review
of
status
which
takes
place
periodically.
ms.
smith
had
had
a
review
of
foster-care
status
with
regard
to
these
children
only
two
weeks
before
the
children
were
to
be
removed
from
her
home,
and
the
record
shows
that
the
agencies
do
not
require
the
court
to
order
that
the
children
be
removed
before
the
children
actually
are
removed.
the
foster-care
review
status
is
a
hearing
in
which
the
child
is
determined
to
remain
in
public
care,
in
foster
care
generally,
and
in
which
the
agency
is
free
then
to
move
the
child
anyplace,
as
they
were
preparing
to
do
in
ms.
smith’s
case
so
that
there
are
not
other
available
ways
in
which
the
liberty
interest
could
be
protected.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
there
is.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
they
can
bring
information;
but
they
don't
know
the
reason
that
the
child
is
going
to
be
removed,
so
they
are
somewhat
handicapped.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
they
may
or
they
may
not
be,
and
it
may
or
may
not
be
the
reason
for
which
the
child
is
going
to
be
removed;
the
record
is
very
clear
on
this.
they
don't
know
the
reason
for
the
child
being
moved
in
many
cases.
if
the
reason
for
the
child
being
removed
is
based
on
a
report
in
the
record,
they
do
not
have
access
for
that.
they
have
a
person
who
is
conducting
the
conference
who
has
already
presented
them.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
state
law
says
that,
that's
right;
but
there
are
certain
exceptions.
i
think
that
the
situations
vary
enormously.
the
gandy
children’s
mother
voluntarily
placed
these
children
with
the
state.
we
are
talking
about
situations
in
which
at
least
a
year
has
passed;
often,
much
more
time
has
passed.
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
law
says
that
the
natural
parents
have
an
absolute
right;
in
fact,
state
law
has
changed
since
this
decision
and
has
been
modified
somewhat.
so
now
a
hearing
that
might
be
directed
by
this
court
could
look
into
a
few
other
things,
depending
on
the
length
of
time
the
child
had
been
out.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
think
the
standard
varies.
i
think
that
the
standard
that
would
be
articulated
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
if
the
statute
says
that,
383(2)
says
that
an
agency
may
remove
a
child
from
a
foster
home
at
the
agency’s
discretion.
that's
the
standard
in
the
statute.
agencies
generally
operate
under
the
rubric
that
they
are
acting
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
but
the
agency
decision-making
process
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
certainly
is,
but
it
is
obviously
a
sufficiently
vague
and
subjective
standard
at
which
a
lot
of
subjective
information
is
relevant
so
that
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no.
no,
your
honor,
all
we
are
suggesting
is
that
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
an
adequate
procedure
to
determine
whether
the
standard
has
been
correctly
applied.
i
do
not
think
that
anyone
at
this
point
will
assert
that
the
standard
was
correctly
applied
with
regard
to
the
removal
of
eric
and
danielle
gandy
from
ms.
smith’s
home,
and
in
fact
the
agency
itself
changed
workers
and
reversed
itself.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
the
agency
decision
is
subject
to
the
conference
that
the
district
court
declared
unconstitutional,
and
then
the
child
may
be
removed.
after
the
child
is
removed,
there
is
a
full
administrative
fair
hearing
provided
by
section
400
of
the
social
services
law.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
and
then
that
is
subject
to
judicial
review,
perhaps
many,
many
months
and
years
down
the
road
after
the
child
has
been
subjected
to
an
incorrect
decision.
after
eric
and
danielle,
for
example,
could
have
been
out
of
ms.
smith’s
home
for
a
year-and-a-half
by
the
time
this
case
could
have
gotten
into
state
court
to
review
whether
or
not
ms.
smith
indeed
had
arthritis
that
made
her
incapable
of
caring
for
the
children.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
i
do
not
think
that
they
required
a
full
trial-type
hearing;
but
i
think
it
was
their
intention,
i
think
the
opinion
specifically
says,
that
they
contemplate
this
to
be
the
final
administrative
decision.
so
that
judicial
review
could
be
obtained
immediately,
and
if
any
stay
was
going
to
be
granted
that
of
course
would
be
up
to
the
court;
it
hardly
would
be
automatic.
but
i
think
that
they
were
trying
to
make
this
decision-making
process
as
speedy
as
possible
rather
than
allowing
the
present
procedure,
which
contemplates
a
conference
first,
the
removal
and
then
full-scale
review
after
the
harm
has
already
been
done,
so
that
in
a
sense
the
harm
is
really
irrevocable,
because
the
child
has
already
been
subjected
to
a
removal,
which
may
have
not
been
necessary
and
which
constitutional
standards
we
believe
could
require
and
make
much
more
adequate
in
terms
of
making
a
decision
for
these
children.
we
are
talking
about
children
who
are
being
separated
from
what
may
be
the
only
home
they
know.
we're
talking
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
think
it
would
not
be
subject
to
federal
court
jurisdiction.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
the
person
who
would
decide
whether
the
decision
was
arbitrary
would
be
a
public
official.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
the
constitution
requires
here
is
that
the
decision-maker
not
be
previously
involved
in
the
decision.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
i
think
--
first
of
all,
there
is
nothing
to
require
that
this
decision-maker
not
be
someone
with
some
background
in
social
services.
but
because
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
because
the
people
who
then
appear
before
the
decision-maker
who
want
to
present
the
information
to
the
decision-maker
are
burdened
by
the
fact
that
the
decision-maker
has
knowledge
of
a
great
deal
of
information
that
the
other
people
may
not
know
of
and
may
not
have
an
opportunity
to
refute.
if
the
social
services’
official
has
been
involved
in
the
decision,
as
the
record
shows
many
of
them
were,
then
they
may
have
access
to
a
great
deal
of
information
that,
in
fact,
is
not
accurate;
and
when
the
family
and
the
child’s
representative
or
the
child
comes
in
to
explain
why
the
decision
is
incorrect,
then
the
people
who
come
in
to
explain
that
will
not
know
about
what
information
the
decision-maker
has
in
his
or
her
head,
and
they
can't
refute
it.
that
is
why
it
is
important
the
decision-maker
make
a
decision
based
on
information
that's
presented
then
that
each
side
can
have
an
opportunity
to
refute.
this
doesn't
require
lawyers.
it
can
be
as
informal
as
people
sitting
down
and
talking.
but
the
decision
cannot
be
made
fairly
unless
all
parties
know
what
the
other
side
has
to
say
and
have
an
opportunity
to
say,
"this
fact
is
wrong,
but
this
fact
is
right"
or
"the
fact
is
half-right
and
half-wrong".
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
person
is
an
employee
of
the
social
service
district,
and
if
the
child
is
in
care
with
the
social
service
district
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
we
are
talking
about
the
same
kind
of
decision-maker
as
in
goldberg.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
we
want
someone
who
was
not
involved
in
this
particular
case
who
will
make
a
decision
based
on
the
information
presented
to
them
at
the
time
everybody
has
an
opportunity
to
hear
the
information.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
at
the
conference,
no.
the
person
at
the
conference,
the
record
shows,
usually
was
involved
in
the
decision-making
at
the
initial
stages.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that
is
right,
but
we
would
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
but
we
would
say
that
it
cannot
be
someone
from
the
private
agency;
it
has
to
be
a
public
official,
as
the
conference
now
requires.
these
are
private
agencies
that
are
publicly
funded
and
are
delegated
with
the
responsibility
of
taking
care
of
these
children.
it
is
a
public
function,
and
we
would
say
that
an
in-agency
conference
would
not
be
adequate;
but
a
social
service
agency
conference
just
as
was
contemplated
in
goldberg
v.
kelly
would
be
adequate.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
we
are
asking
only
for
the
same
kind
of
decision-maker
as
is
presently
provided
in
the
revised
city
procedure.
we
are
not
asking
for
a
different
kind
of
decision-maker.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
not.
the
district
court
said
that
the
exact
details
of
the
procedure
should
be
worked
out
by
new
york;
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
procedure
and
whether
or
not
it
should
satisfy
minimal
due
process
with
the
right
of
everyone
to
be
heard
i
believe
is
a
federal
issue
and
is
a
constitutional
issue.
and
i
believe
that
these
children
have
been
condemned
to
suffer
grievous
loss,
they
do
have
a
constitutionality
protected
interest
in
the
relationship,
in
this
family
relationship,
which
may
be
their
only
family
relationship
and
their
only
hope
for
permanence.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i
am
here
representing
the
interests
of
the
foster
family.
as
you
know,
your
honor,
i
represent
the
foster
parents.
they
have
an
interest
in
the
foster-family
relationship.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
it
is
our
position
that
we
represent
the
foster
children’s
rights
as
articulated
by
the
district
court.
ms.
buttenwieser,
as
you
know,
has
not
requested
such
relief;
the
foster
parents
have
requested
such
relief,
and
we
believe
we
have
standing
to
raise
the
children’s
interests
with
regard
to
this
right.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
hear
your
question.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
alright,
with
regard
to
the
most
common
situation,
80%
of
the
situations
in
which
the
child
is
being
removed
from
the
foster
home
and
to
be
transferred
someplace
else.
the
hearing
is
to
decide
whether
the
transfer
is
in
the
child’s
best
interests.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
new
york
says
that
children
can
be
removed
at
the
agency’s
discretion.
i
believe
that
new
york
also
takes
as
a
matter
of
legislative
policy
the
decisions
made
with
regard
to
children
should
be
made
in
their
best
interests.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
the
district
court
did
not
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
i'm
sorry.
the
district
court
did
not
deal
with
standards
at
all.
the
district
court
was
very
explicit,
the
questions
to
be
answered
at
the
hearing
about
what'
in
the
best
interests
of
the
children
are
a
matter
solely
of
state
policy.
there
is
not
federal
policy
that
is
imposed
by
the
district
court
decision.
the
district
court
says
that
the
hearing
is
only
to
adequately
effectuate
state
policy
and
that
it
is
constitutionally
required,
but
to
effectuate
state
policy
and
not
to
impose
any
kinds
of
federal
policy.
the
question
to
be
answered
when
the
child
is
going
to
be
returned
to
a
natural
parent
is
the
question
that
is
detailed
by
state
law,
it
is
a-state
law
standard
that
has
to
be
applied
then,
and
it
is
a
different
standard
than
when
the
child
is
going
to
go
to
another
foster
family;
but
it
is
determined
by
state
law.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
they
are
not
applied
in
a
constitutionally
adequate
manner,
and
the
decision
is
not
reviewed
in
any
kind
of
a
constitutionally
required
manner
until
after
the
child
is
out
of
the
home.
it
is
reviewed
after
the
child
is
out
of
the
home.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
it
is.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
child
does
not
under
new
york
law,
but
that
would
be
--
that
would
likely
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
the
state
could
do
that,
that's
right.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
well,
i
think
that
if
a
child
were
in
a
foster
home
and
there
was
such
a
relationship,
then
the
fact
that
the
license
was
going
to
be
withdrawn
would
be
an
issue
at
the
hearing;
and
i
believe
under
the
district
court
decision
that
would
require
a
hearing,
and
i
believe
even
under
the
existing
procedures.
there
is
presently
a
procedure
where
that
foster
parent
could
challenge
the
determination
of
withdrawal
of
the
license;
but
that
would
be
again
after
the
child
is
removed.
section
400,
i
believe,
contemplates
that;
but
that
again
is
after
the
harm
has
been
done,
the
unnecessary
harm.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes
and
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
and
i
believe
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
that's
right.
i
believe
that's
a
situation
covered
by
the
district
court’s
order,
because
in
that
case
the
reason
for
the
removal
would
be
the
cancellation
of
the
license,
and
then
there
would
be
a
hearing
at
which
it
could
be
determined
whether
it
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
then
to
be
removed
from
that
foster
home.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
not
at
all,
your
honor.
in
fact
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
we
would
want
that.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
we're
not
saying
nothing
can
be
done
without
a
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
yes,
as
long
as
it's
not
excessive.
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
does;
i
think
that
that
becomes
a
state-law
issue
whether
--
ms.
marcia
robinson
lowry
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
only
time
a
hearing
is
required
is
when
there
is
going
to
be
a
substantial
deprivation
to
the
children,
and
we
think
that
children
should
not
come
into
foster
care
unnecessarily.
we
think
that
the
best
thing
for
a
child
is
to
stay
with
the
natural
family
under
most
circumstances;
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
all
we're
saying
is
that
after
time
has
passed
and
after
a
child
has
been
in
the
relationship
for
a
year
or
more,
the
child
then
has
an
interest
in
the
relationship
and
has
an
interest
in
not
being
subjected
to
arbitrary
deprivation
of
that
relationship.
we're
not
talking
at
all
about
substantive
standards
when
we're
talking
about
the
natural
family.
thank
you,
your
honor.
