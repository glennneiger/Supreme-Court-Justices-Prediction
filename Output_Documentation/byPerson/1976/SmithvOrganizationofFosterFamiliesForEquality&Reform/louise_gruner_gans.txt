ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
appellant’s
natural
parents,
who
entrusted
their
children
to
new
york
social
services
officials
for
interim
foster
care
and
not
for
adoption.
the
overall
question
raised
by
the
order
of
the
three-judge
court
below
is
whether
the
federal
constitution
requires
new
york
state
to
provide
automatic
hearings
before
a
child
in
a
foster
home
may
return
to
its
own
home
or
be
transferred
to
another
foster
home
or
adoptive
home.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
due
process
to
the
child.
the
specific
question
raised
with
respect
to
natural
parents
is
whether
the
federal
constitution
permits
such
hearings
to
be
held
when
children
are
returning
home
to
them.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
that
is
correct.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
no,
it
was
not
the
result
of
a
court
order.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
no,
there
was
no
adjudication
of
neglect.
on
the
contrary,
new
york
has
neglect
proceedings.
the
purpose
of
this
kind
of
placement,
which
follows
a
separate
legal
track,
is
to
enable
parents
who
through
no
fault
of
their
own
are
unable
to
care
for
their
children
because
of
poverty
and
some
other
crisis.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
that
is
correct.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
the
essential
understanding
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
were
two.
they
were
willing
to
entrust
their
children
to
the
state;
they
needed
help.
they
were
assured
that
they
had
a
right
to
have
the
children
returned.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
by
statutory
law,
and
by
actual
representations
of
social
services'
officials.
now,
the
forms
they
sign
do
not
always
say
that,
and
since
this
action
has
commenced,
there
have
been
about
four
different
forms
the
parents
have
signed:
the
first
one,
which
says
nothing;
the
last
one,
which
is
in
special
procedure
no.
29
of
the
new
york
city
department
of
social
services,
says
you
have
a
right
to
have
your
child
returned.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
that
is
right.
well...
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
not
when
you
are
fit.
we
consider
you
legally
fit.
it
is
not
unfitness
to
be
ill
in
the
same
way
as
it
is
to
neglect
a
child.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
when
you
are
ready.
you
are
entitled
to
the
return
of
your
child,
and
we
can
unilaterally
return
the
child,
subject
to
our
power
as
the
state
of
new
york
always
to
take
into
court
if
we
think
you
would
be
abusive
or
neglectful.
so
that
is
the
basic
understanding.
there
are
additional
understandings:
the
parent
is
expected
to
visit
the
child.
again,
if
a
parent
is
temporarily
hospitalized,
she
can't;
but
when
she
is
able
to,
she
is
expected
to
visit
the
child,
and
she
is
expected
to
make
efforts
to
deal
with
whatever
condition
that
required
the
placement
so
that
the
child
can
come
home.
but
--
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
that
is
correct,
it
is
not
an
adoption.
it
is
only
if
the
parents’
rights
can
subsequently
be
terminated
in
a
proceeding
which
new
york
provides
for
termination
of
parental
rights.
for
example,
a
parent
places
a
child;
and
she
recovers,
never
comes
to
see
the
child,
new
york
after
a
certain
point
can
bring
a
proceeding
to
terminate
the
parent’s
parental
rights,
and
then
the
child
is
available
for
adoption.
but
it
is
not
anticipated
that
any
voluntary
foster-care
placement
with
the
foster
parent
is
an
adoptive
placement,
not
at
all.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
the
way
the
present
new
york
scheme
works,
basically
during
the
first
18
months
of
placement,
the
way
the
scheme
is
drawn,
the
relationship
of
parent
and
agency
involving
the
child
is
insulated
from
competing
claims
of
foster
parents.
during
this
period,
for
example,
if
the
parent
who
places
a
child
is
never
heard
from
again,
unless
the
parent
is
hospitalized
and
is
unable
to
come,
then
sometime
around
the
one-year
point,
the
state
could
file
this
proceeding,
and
it
is
up
to
the
state.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
well,
the
state
monitors
all
placements.
the
department
of
social
services
has
an
extensive
bureaucracy
of
social
workers
whose
responsibility
it
is
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
parent,
to
have
a
special
social
worker
for
the
child
and
to
have
someone
who
supervises
the
foster
home.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
to
monitor
the
situation,
correct
and
they
keep
agency
case
records,
both
as
a
matter
of
social
practice
and
as
a
matter
of
requirement
of
state
regulations.
so
they
must
document
at
all
times
what
they
are
doing
in
the
case.
but
during
the
first
18
months,
the
agency
can
see,
well,
is
this
mother
dealing
with
her
situation
and
by
the
18-month
point
or
sooner
--
the
earliest
point
is
6
months
--
if
the
parent
disappears,
has
never
been
heard
from
again,
they
can
bring
the
proceeding.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
that
is
correct.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
well,
i'm
tempted
to
say
that
is
a
good
question.
it
requires
this
explanation.
until
about
six
years
ago,
this
whole
system
was
an
administrative
system
without
any
kinds
of
legal
checks
for
the
parent,
for
the
child,
for
the
foster
parent.
so,
for
example,
if
a
parent
wanted
a
child
returned,
there
was
no
mechanism
which
would
ensure
that
the
child
was
returned.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
well,
if
the
parent
knew
about
it.
one
of
my
clients,
ms.
rodriguez,
was
a
person
who
placed
her
child,
wanted
her
child
three
months
later.
although
the
law
does
provide
habeas
corpus,
no
one
advised
her
that
it
exists.
so
she
just
kept
going
to
the
agency
and
saying,
"i
want
my
child"
and
i
tried
to
document
in
the
record
as
much
as
i
could
and
in
my
brief
how
that
could
cause
time
to
pass,
even
though
the
mother
wanted
the
child
and
even
though
the
mother
was
not
unfit.
so
that
was
one
problem.
the
other
problem
is,
the
agency
had
no
accountability
independently
aside
from
the
parent.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
foster-care
review,
which
was
enacted
in,
well,
roughly
1972
and
has
gone
through
a
series
of
transformations,
was
to
provide
an
accountability
mechanism
so
that
this
does
not
happen.
in
1975,
new
york
passed
a
social
services
law
section
384(a),
which
provides
when
a
parent
asks
for
a
child,
the
state
must
return
the
child
or
go
to
court,
and
there
has
to
be
an
immediate
hearing
showing
why
the
child
should
not
be
returned.
now,
what
we
have
in
the
foster-care
system
now
are
children
who
are
still,
you
might
say,
the
residue
of
the
old
system.
in
ms.
wallace’s
case,
those
children
who
were
in
placement
for
four
years
--
she
had
six
children
--
after
two
years
the
agency
returned
two
children
to
her
with
the
idea
that
if
she
managed
with
the
two,
in
a
while
the
others
would
come
home.
now,
this
is
not
an
unusual
approach
where
there
are
many
children
and
there
is
a
mother
who
has
gone
through
a
depression.
so
that's
the
explanation.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
for
a
parent
who
wants
her
children
and
asks
for
them
under
present
law
is
that
although
the
state
finds
nothing
wrong
with
the
parent,
if
the
child
has
been
in
foster
care
for
one
year,
not
four
years.
the
four-year
case
will
now
be
taken
care
under
a
foster-care
review
proceeding.
the
agency
cannot
return
the
child;
and
the
parents'
rights
is
conditioned
on
prevailing
in
an
enforced
custody
contest
with
the
foster
parent.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
no,
there
was
no
standard
imposed.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
well,
if
it
is
a
contest,
whatever
the
standard,
the
parent
has
to
prevail.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
well,
the
district
court
ordered
hearings
to
be
held
in
every
case.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
to
provide
a
forum.
what
the
district
court
said
--
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
well,
that
is
exactly
our
question,
to
find
out
what.
we
submit
that
if
there
is
information
which
a
foster
parent
has
which
would
suggest
that
a
child
that
is
about
to
be
returned
home
might
in
some
way
be
neglected
or
harmed
by
the
parent
that
there
are
existing
procedures
available
that
the
foster
parent
can
resort
to
or,
of
course,
that
the
social
services'
agency
can
resort
to.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
well,
that
hardly
seems
to
be
a
reason
for
a
hearing
in
which
the
foster
parent,
who
as...
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
the
hearing
--
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
no.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
if
the
case
is
of
a
child
in
a
foster
home
for
one
year,
then
the
standard
is,
is
the
parent
unfit.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
leaving
the
new
york
standard
in
place,
and
that
is
the
standard
in
one-year
cases,
as
interpreted
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
well,
the
district
court
said
it
was
not
creating
a
new
standard.
what
happened
is
that
when
the
foster
parents
brought
the
action,
they
challenged
the
removal
hearings,
and
they
also
challenged
the
standards.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
the
foster
parent
and
the
state,
yes.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
no
--
well,
the
parent
has
to
defend
a
right,
which
she
has,
because
under
state
law
she
is
legally
fit;
and
she
has
to
defend
her
right
without
there
being
an
accusation,
because
the
foster
parent
comes
--
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
our
point
is
this:
if
the
foster
parent
has
evidence,
then
article
10
of
the
family
court
act
provides
a
proceeding,
which
is
instantly
available
to
the
foster
parent
and
anyone
else,
to
protect
the
child
from
being
returned
to
a
neglectful
parent.
section
1031
of
the
new
york
family
code
act
specifically
provides
that
neglect
proceedings
are
applicable
with
respect
to
children
in
foster
care
who
may
be
returned
home
to
a
home
where
they
may
be
neglected.
so
there
is
that
forum.
in
addition,
if
the
foster
parent
has
information
about
possible
neglect
and
tells
that
to
the
social
worker,
new
york
child
protective
laws
mandate
an
immediate
24-hour
investigation,
and
a
social
worker
who
does
not
follow
up
on
the
information
is
subject
to
criminal
and
civil
liability.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
that
is
correct.
we
say
that
that
is
a
hearing
without
a
purpose,
a
fishing
expedition
against
the
parent
to
find
out
about
parents'
failings,
and
we
believe
that
to
require
every
parent
of
a
child
in
foster
care,
although
they
are
legally
fit,
if
they've
had
their
child
in
foster
care
for
one
year,
to
submit
to
that
kind
of
hearing
is
an
impermissible
burden
on
the
parent.
ms.
louise
gruner
gans
there
is
a
requirement
of
a
ten-day
notice
before
any
child
is
moved
out
of
a
foster
home.
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
a
question
--
well,
i
think
the
notice
requirement
applies
in
all
cases.
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
a
question
as
to
whether
any
of
the
subsequent
hearing
procedures
were
intended
to
apply
to
the
case
of
children
going
home,
as
opposed
to
situations
where
children
were
going
to
other
foster
places.
