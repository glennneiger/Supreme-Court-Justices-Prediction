ms.
maria
l.
marcus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
new
york
state,
but
i
am
representing
today
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
city
of
new
york
and
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
i
think
mr.
justice
white’s
questions
illustrate
the
drastic
overkill
in
the
decision
below,
in
which
we
have
in
the
year
1975
16
requests
for
hearings.
26
in
the
entire
period
that
this
hearing
procedure
of
new
york
city
has
been
in
operation
and
just
to
summarize
what
that
procedure
would
offer
to
anybody
who
wants
it
counsel,
cross-examination;
it's
a
full-dress
adversary
hearing.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
is
correct.
of
course,
the
vast
majority
of
foster
children
are
in
the
new
york
city
population.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
and
of
course
the
removal
is
not
--
the
ten-day
notice
simply
sets
the
date
of
the
removal;
it
is
not
by
any
means
the
parameters
of
the
process.
the
process
goes
on
over
a
period
of
months.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
is
correct
and
also,
of
course,
at
the
18-month
point,
new
york
state
has
a
statute
in
which
a
full
judicial
hearing
is
available
to
a
foster
parent
who
can
come
in
and
present
whatever
reasons
they
would
present
to
the
hearing
officers
that
are
now
being
asked
for
by
the
district
court
to
the
family
court.
and...
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
in
392,
they
can
present
a
variety
of
information;
if
they
have
information
of
neglect
or
abuse,
that
can
of
course
be
brought
forward.
they
can
also
bring
forward
any
other
reason
that
they
feel
that
the
child
should
remain
in
their
home.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
is
triggered
by
the
removal.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
18
months,
but
when
there
has
been
a
removal
or
there
will
be
a
removal.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
to
a
foster-family
placement,
as
opposed
to
the
natural
parents.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
right,
if
there
is
a
removal
contemplated
to
another
foster
placement,
that
foster
parent
can
request
the
full-dress
adversary
hearing
that
new
york
city
covers.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
it
does
not
include
the
return
to
the
natural
parent,
it
includes
any
other
foster
placement,
which
would
be
to
a
foster
parent
or
to
an
institution,
to
something
other
than
the
natural
parents.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
adoption,
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
in
the
case
where
the
child
would
be
adopted.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
it
is
not
available
in
the
case
the
child
is
being
moved
for
adoption.
it
is
for
another
foster
placement.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
now,
the
district
court
ordered
these
automatic
hearings
because
children
cannot
speak
for
themselves
and
because
the
court
assumed
that
the
foster
parent
would
not
speak
for
them
for
a
continuation
of
the
foster-care
relationship
in
asking
for
this
hearing.
this
assumption,
it
seems
to
me,
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
argument
of
appellees
that
after
a
year,
the
foster-care
relationship
is
the
equivalent
of
the
biological
relationship,
because
it
is
inconceivable
to
assume
that
a
biological
parent
is
going
to
allow
their
child
to
be
taken
away
and
not
bother
to
ask
for
a
hearing.
if
the
foster
parents
have
the
feeling
of
natural
parents
for
the
child
and
they
feel
it
should
remain
in
the
home,
they
will
request
a
hearing;
and
since
only
26
foster
parents
have
done
so
in
new
york
city
in
the
past
2½
years.
this
means
that
the
transfers
that
have
been
involved
have
not
involved
any
dispute
between
the
parties
and
as
this
court
held
last
month
in
codd
v.
velger,
due
process
doesn't
require
a
hearing
where
there
are
no
factual
disputes
to
be
resolved.
now,
what
is
another
result
of
the
decision
below,
in
addition
to
the
costly
hearings
and
the
hearings
which
nobody
really
wants?
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
nobody
except
those
few
that
have
requested
them.
by
the
way,
i
am
advised
here
that
the
hearings
are
available
if
the
move
is
to
an
adoptive
home;
so
i
stand
corrected
on
that
point.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
pardon?
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
am
advised
that
the
hearing
process
available
under
the
city
procedure
is
available
if
the
child
is
being
moved
to
an
adoptive
home.
the
only
exception
is
if
it
is
being
moved
to
its
natural
parent.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
is
required
regardless
of
where
the
child
is
going.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes.
now,
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
earlier
of
what
is
the
standard
going
to
be
in
these
hearings
which
are
going
to
come
up?
what
is
the
standard
now,
what
is
going
to
happen
under
the
district
court’s
mandate?
well,
we
have
to
first
emphasize
that
new
york
law
seeks
to
effectuate
the
reunion
of
the
child
with
the
natural
parent
or
adoption.
it
does
not
seek
to
maintain
the
child’s
relationship
to
a
foster
parent
who
is
taking
care
of
that
child
by
virtue
of
a
contract
and
providing
them
with
temporary
care
rather
than
an
adoptive
home.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
the
384(b),
which
is
a
new
statute
which
has
been
passed,
does
contemplate
the
situation
that
you
are
asking
about
it.
it
contemplates
that
there
be
no
limbo
of
this
type,
that
either
the
natural
parent
will
be
returned
the
child
or,
if
it
appears
that
the
natural
parent
is
not
going
to
be
fit
to
do
that,
that
the
parents'
rights
should
be
terminated
and
the
child
be
freed
for
adoption.
and
the
legislature
states
there
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
purpose
to
allow
this
extended
limbo
to
continue
to
occur.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
actually,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
of
the
removals
from
foster
homes,
one-third
are
at
the
request
of
the
foster
parent
themselves.
so
that
of
the
movements
within
foster
care,
one-third
of
them
are
attributable
to
the
foster
parent
and
the
foster
parent’s
request.
now
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
i
think
that
is
certainly
a
major
reason.
another
reason
would
be
that
i
think
some
foster
parents
are
suited,
for
example,
to
a
younger
child
who
is
more
sedentary.
when
the
child
becomes
more
physically
active
and
engaging
in
more
different
kinds
of
things,
a
foster
parent
finds
it
more
difficult
to
exercise
supervision.
now,
what
would
the
effect
of
the
district
court’s
decisions
be
that
there
are
going
to
now
be
automatic
hearings
in
virtually
every
case
where
a
child
has
been
in
a
foster
home
for
one
year
or
more?
obviously,
that
decision
would
require
a
stay
of
removal
during
the
period
where
the
hearing
is
scheduled,
takes
place
and
a
decision
is
rendered.
and
such
stays
would
probably
be
issued
during
the
course
of
appellate
reviews
that
are
available
under
the
new
york
civil
practice
law
and
rules.
and
what
happens
with
the
substantive
decisions
that
are
ultimately
rendered
in
these
administrative
hearings
and
the
review
and
in
the
judicial
hearings,
which
are
presently
available
under
new
york
law?
if
the
district
court’s
decision
is
affirmed
by
this
court,
new
york
judges
will
read
it
as
a
mandate
to
put
a
new
weight
in
the
scale,
the
child’s
liberty
interest
in
the
foster-care
relationship.
and
since
this
liberty
interest
would
be
of
constitutional
magnitude,
judges
would
ultimately
give
the
natural
parents'
claim
less
weight
than
it
presently
has,
even
where
such
parents
are
neither
neglectful
nor
abusive.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well
then,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time.
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
your
honor,
let
me
just
point
to
the
record
to
correct
a
few
errors
that
were
made
in
appellees'
argument.
so
far
as
the
statistics
are
concerned,
page
90(a)
of
the
appendix
contains
a
projection
based
on
'75
and
early
'76
figures,
which
state
that
as
to
new
york
city
there
would
4,200
removals
or
changes
of
status.
half
of
those
would
be
children
discharged
from
foster
care
so
that
we've
got
half
being
transferred
within,
half
being
discharged
out.
now,
in
figures
by
the
children’s
child
welfare
information
service,
which
is
a
computerized
service
that
keeps
records
on
this
for
the
agencies
and
for
the
city.
1975
figures
were
attached
to
interveners'
reply
brief,
and
that
showed
that
of
the
discharges
--
and
now,
we
are
talking
about
half
of
transfers,
half
are
within
the
system,
half
out
--
of
the
half
that
goes
out.
in
the
year
1975
of
the
group
of
children
in
foster
care
for
more
than
a
year,
48.1%
returned
to
the
natural
parents.
so
those
are
the
statistical
facts
as
shown
by
the
record.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
both,
your
honor,
there
can't
be
a
liberty
interest,
because
if
there
were
one
it
would
collide
head-on
with
the
one
already
declared
by
this
court
to
the
natural
family,
first
for
the
reason
that
i
stated
before,
that
the
standard
has
got
to
change.
if
we're
going
to
have
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
but
the
point
is
that
once
you
declare
a
liberty
interest
in
the
foster-care
relationship,
it
is
going
to
change
the...
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
state
cannot
guarantee
a
liberty
interest
in
a
relationship
out
of
which
one
party
can
walk
at
any
time.
the
natural
parents
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
that
would
abrogate
392,
of
course.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
that
decides
to
abrogate
existing
statutes.
i
think
new
york
is
not
under
any
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
any
foster-care
services.
this
is
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
i
would
say
that
although
as
a
matter
of
policy,
obviously
that
would
be
undesirable
and
would
not
be
done
under
new
york
law.
you
cannot
have
a
liberty
interest
in
a
relationship
in
which
one
party
has
no
obligation
whatever
to
remain
with
it.
imagine
what
would
happen
if
a
natural
parent
or
an
adoptive
parent
decided
to
walk
out
of
a
relationship.
they
would
be
jailed,
and
they
would
be
publicly
stigmatized.
there
is
a
great
difference
between
an
adoptive
and
natural
parent
and
the
foster
parent
here,
there
is
no
obligation.
ms.
goldberg
was
obligated
only
so
long
as
she
took
the
state’s
money.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
natural
parents’
rights?
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
because
this
court
has
declared
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
for
a
natural
family
to
be
together,
and
under
this
court's
decision
it
would
not
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
decisions
would
not
be
possible
to
abrogate
the
rights
of
a
natural
family.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
as
a
member
of
the
natural
family,
he
would
partake
of
that
interest;
but
that
does
not
occur
here.
and
i
might
add
as
to
the
second
part
of
your
question
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
yes,
this
court
has
so
declared
and
we
are
under
this
court’s
mandate.
now
insofar
as
--
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
foster
family
because
of
the
complete
difference
in
that
kind
of
relationship.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
the
state
always
has
custody
in
the
case
where
the
child
is
in
foster
care,
and
then
of
course
the
foster
parents
by
statute
have
a
mandatory
statutory
preference
to
become
the
adoptive
parents
in
that
situation
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
well,
i
want
to
correct
also
a
misconception
about
392,
which
came
up
in
appellees’
argument,
392
of
the
social
services
law.
the
foster
parent
can
ask
the
court
to
maintain
that
child
in
his
home.
it
does
operate
as
a
possible
pre-removal
judicial
hearing,
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
where
that
was
done.
it
does
not
have
to
wait
until
years
and
years
later.
this
is
a
pre-removal
judicial
hearing
which
is
available.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
and
that
is
in
the
family
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
ms.
maria
l.
marcus
no,
this
is
in
the
family
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
of
course
with
usual
appeals
and
eventually
to
this
court
if
there's
something
amiss.
now,
justice
stevens
brought
up
the
question
of
whether
the
decision
below
contemplated
the
child
having
some
role,
the
decision
below
didn't
say
so.
but
under
392,
this
judicial
proceeding
that
we
have
under
the
family
court
act,
the
child
is
there,
and
it's
presumed
that
he
will
be
because
there's
a
statutory
section
in
that,
392(6),
which
says
that
the
court
may
dispense
with
the
presence
of
the
child.
so
it
obviously
is
contemplated
that
the
child
will
be
there
and
will
be
heard
unless
the
court
feels
that
it's
not
necessary.
