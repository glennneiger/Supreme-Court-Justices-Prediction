ms.
lowry,
suppose
the
district
court
in
another
case
says
that
before
the
child
surrendered
by
its
own
parents
can
be
accepted
by
the
state,
there
must
be
a
hearing.
would
you
complain
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
want
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
nothing
can
be
done
concerning
the
child
without
a
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can
the
foster
parent
paddle
the
child
without
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
liberty
at
all,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
i
didn't
hear
it.
