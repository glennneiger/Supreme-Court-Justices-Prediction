justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
had
a
problem
common
on
many
counsel,
being
peppered
by
more
than
one
member
of
the
court
at
a
time.
what
is
the
issue
that
this
hearing
is
supposed
to
resolve?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
the
reason
that
that
is
because
new
york
says
that
is
what
the
issue
is?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
is
this
question
to
be
answered
at
the
hearing
one
that
has
its
direct
source
in
new
york
law,
or
is
it
superimposed
as
part
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
by
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
each
of
these
standards
is
now
applied
by
various
new
york
public
agencies,
but
just
not
in
the
same
manner
as
the
district
court
thinks
they
ought
to
be
applied.
