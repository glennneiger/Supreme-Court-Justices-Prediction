ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
attorney
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
the
children,
and
i
want
to
discuss
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
rights
of
the
children.
in
fact,
my
principle
objection
on
behalf
of
the
children
is
that
i
am
reluctant
to
see
any
more
adults
being
given
any
more
rights
from
which
they
have
to
be
disentangled
before
one
can
consider
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
this
case
was
to
start
--
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
we
do
not
attack
anybody’s
rights.
we
do
not
attack
the
rights
of
the
foster
parents,
the
natural
parents
or
anybody.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
no,
sir,
we
do
not
concede
that.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
but
i
didn't
assume
that
we
had
to
attack
it,
because
the
court
below
found
that
they
did
not
or
did
not
reach
that
question;
it
did
not
grant
them
constitutional
right.
and
when
i'm
talking
about
the
children,
i'm
not
talking
about
delinquent
children;
i'm
talking
about
all
of
the
children
who
come
into
care
of
the
state,
because
the
parents
are
not
able
to
take
care
of
them.
once
i
got
into
the
case,
i
examined
the
complaint
and
decided
that
on
behalf
of
the
children,
the
relief
that
was
being
requested
was
really
benefiting
the
foster
parents
and
not
the
children.
and
i
have
submitted
an
answer
in
which
i
have
stated
that
none
of
the
relief
requested
will
be
of
benefit
to
the
children,
and
i
have
asked
that
it
be
dismissed.
however,
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
as
a
result
a
case
or
a
controversy
has
already
been
briefed,
and
unless
the
court
wishes
an
answer,
i
do
not
propose
to
answer
that
question.
we
are
opposed
to
these
mandated
hearings
in
the
first
place,
because
we
do
not
see
the
advantage
to
anyone.
as
it
is,
a
foster
parent
has
a
right
to
ask
for
at
least
to
be
heard
--
not
a
hearing,
but
to
be
heard
--
if
it
wishes
to,
and
the
number
of
foster
parents
that
have
requested
to
be
heard
in
new
york
city
since
a
change
went
in
in
the
regulations
permitting
an
actual
hearing
has
been,
i
think,
six
or
seven
cases
or
at
most
ten
cases
in
one
year,
whereas
if
we
have
a
hearing
here
we
will
have
upwards
of
thousands
of
cases,
2,000
and
3,000,
cases,
because
that
is
the
number
of
children
who
either
return
home
or
go
to
another
facility
or
are
placed
for
adoption
out
of
the
foster
home,
because
a
number
of
foster
families
adopt
the
children
if
they
become
free
for
adoption,
and
that
is
desirable;
but
where
it
is
not
desirable
and
the
children
have
to
be
moved
into
an
adoptive
home.
you
take
the
little
boy
who
was
involved
as
a
plaintiff
in
this
proceeding,
rafael
serrano.
the
parents
claimed
that
they
had
a
right
to
consider
that
this
child
would
stay
with
them;
but
when
they
separated,
they
left
the
child.
the
child
is
now
back
in
an
institution,
because
they
did
not
keep
the
child.
there
was
no
counter-obligation
on
the
part
of
the
foster
family
to
keep
the
child.
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
these
proceedings,
which
have
been
provided
by
the
state
of
new
york
for
determining
whether
or
not
the
child
should
be
returned,
have
up
until
now
not
only
adequately,
as
far
as
anybody
can
see,
determined
when
a
child
should
go
back.
but
there
is
actually
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
are
unsatisfactory,
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
a
hearing
would
add
to
anything
that
would
be
helpful.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
opinion,
the
majority
of
the
court
writes,
"a
hearing
performs
the
salutary
function
of
providing
the
agency
with
an
organized
forum
in
which
to
gather
information".
i'm
afraid
one
does
not
gather
information
in
a
forum,
and
that
information
is
already
available
to
the
agency.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
yes,
very
definitely.
these
children
are
all
under
the
care
of
authorized
agencies,
either
the
city
commissioner,
county
commissioner
or
private
agencies.
in
new
york
city,
they
are
private
agencies.
they
are
by
statute
visited
regularly.
they
are
required
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
encourage
parental
visiting
so
that
the
children
can
be
returned
home,
and
they
are
required
at
very
short
intervals
to
report
to
the
city
or
state
as
to
what
they
have.
all
of
the
material
which
the
opinion
refers
to
as
the
function
of
gathering
information
has
already
been
gathered,
is
already
before
the
decision-maker
on
behalf
of
the
child.
and
the
only
time
that
hearings
have
been
required
in
the
past
is
where
the
foster
parent
has
decided
that
the
foster
parent
wants
to
keep
the
children.
i
feel
in
making
the
children
who
were
under
the
care
of
these
foster
parents
plaintiffs
in
this
proceeding
was
an
unreasonable
usurpation
of
the
rights
of
the
children.
the
children
were
under
the
care
of
public
departments.
by
contact
with
the
parents,
they
had
guardians.
they
did
not
require
next
friends,
and
they
certainly
did
not
require
next
friends
who
were
looking
to
the
joining
of
the
children
with
them
to
obtain
a
right
that
foster
parents
not
only
do
not
have
now,
but
by
contract
do
not
have
now.
the
contract
with
the
foster
parents
requires
them
to
return
the
children
at
any
time
that
the
agency
decides
that
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
be
returned.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
the
ten
days'
notice
is
the
official
notice,
they
can
have
no
less
than
ten
days.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
that
is
the
statutory
notice.
however,
when
children
are
to
be
returned
to
their
natural
parents
or
to
go
to
another
facility,
it
is
customary
--
i
cannot
say
that
it
occurs
in
every
case,
because
i
haven't
examined
every
case;
but
i
represent
a
number
of
social
agencies,
and
i
know
that
those
social
agencies,
at
least,
and
many,
many
others
work
with
the
children
and
with
the
foster
family
to
enable
the
child
to
move
from
that
foster
facility.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
evidence
on
the
procedures
for
removing
children
is
in
the
record.
it's
the
evidence
testified
to
by
ms.
creech
and
ms.
edwards,
both
of
them
executive
directors
of
agencies
with
children,
and
they
describe
a
procedure
whereby
the
child
is
facilitated
in
making
the
change.
if
you
have
a
hearing,
what
you
have
is
litigation;
you
have
the
child
the
subject
of
warring
parties,
and
then
at
the
time
of
the
decision
when
it
has
already
been
made,
you
then
have
a
far
more
precipitous
move
of
the
children.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
it
is
not
exactly
that.
this
is
called
a
foster-care
review
and
the
objective
of
that
review
is
the
child’s
welfare,
not
the
right
of
the
foster
parent
to
say
why
the
child
should
remain,
and
actually
the
emphasis.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
no,
why
in
the
interest
of
the
child’s
welfare
it
should
stay
in
the
foster
home,
because
it
is
presumed
that
the
welfare
of
the
child
will
require
its
return
home
if
there
is
a
home
to
return
to
or
be
placed
in
an
adoptive
home.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
yes,
but
the
actual
statute
is
called
foster-care
review
and
it
is
to
review
why
the
child
has
should
not
be
in
a
permanent
setting,
whether
it
is
his
own
home
or
an
adoptive
home
or
the
foster-family
adopt,
whichever
it
is.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
that
is
correct.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
it
does.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
the
commissioner
of
social
services.
the
parent
signs
a
document
giving
the
commissioner
of
social
services,
either
the
county
or
the
city
commissioner,
the
custody
of
the
child,
a
temporary
custody
to
be
returned
to
the
child
on
the
happening
of
an
event
or
within
on
demand.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
the
authorized
agency
that
is
in
care
of
the
child.
sometimes
it
is
--
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
the
authorized
agencies
all
have
staffs
of
trained
social
workers
who
visit
regularly
in
the
home,
in
the
school,
the
home
with
the
natural
parent.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
yes,
the
foster
parent
--
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
it
is
by
contract,
not
delegated.
the
foster
parent
enters
into
a
contract
with
the
commissioner
or
the
authorized
agency.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
in
all
fairness
to
the
foster-family
arrangement,
i
think
it
is
a
closer
arrangement
than
that;
but
it
is
very
much
like
that.
it
is
like
a
boarding
school
with
all
the
attributes
of
home.
it
is
a
contract
with
them,
a
contract
which
neither
binds
them
nor
binds
the
commissioner.
the
element
which
is
binding
is
the
best
interests
of
the
child.
now,
sometimes
people
do
make
mistakes
as
to
the
best
interests
of
the
child,
but
then
so
do
courts;
so
do
adversary
proceedings.
otherwise,
we
would
not
have
any
appellant
procedures
if
courts
never
made
a
mistake
and
there
are
procedures
whereby
if
it
is
in
the
child’s
best
interests
to
remain
in
the
foster
home,
the
foster
home
has
access
to
the
courts,
family
courts,
the
supreme
court
under
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
and
they
are
not
without
recourse
as
far
as
the
child.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
social
services
law.
i
do
not
know
what
number.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
that's
right.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
that's
right.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
these
foster
parents
were
in
new
york
city.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
they
requested
a
full
trial-type
hearing.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
yes,
they
were
granted
it.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
the
district
court
ordered
that
in
every
case
of
every
child
that
is
to
be
returned
to
their
natural
parent
or
to
another
facility,
there
must
be
a
hearing,
and
that
would
be
children
in
the
thousands,
sometimes
where
there
is
no
dispute.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
with
or
without
a
request.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
not
in
new
york
city.
this
is
not
true
in
the
rest
of
new
york
state.
ms.
helen
l.
buttenwieser
no,
and
i
represent
three
sizeable
child-care
agencies,
and
i
have
had
one
such
hearing
since
the
law
went
into
effect.
