justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clyburn,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
the
nature
of
the
conflict
between
the
united
states
and
the
two
defendants
within
the
three-mile
limit?
paragraph
2
of
the
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
counterclaim
contains
the
allegation
that
the
united
states,
through
discovery,
has
denied
the
states’
authority
to
control
fishing
by
foreign
vessels
and
their
crews
in
the
area
within
three-mile
sea
9.10
their
coastline.
justice
john
paul
stevens
two
questions,
is
there
anything
else
in
the
record
shedding
any
light
on
the
nature
of
the
conflict
between
the
states
and
the
government
within
the
three-mile
limit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
i
was
wondering
how
--
it
is
in
response
to
interrogatories
in
the
like
that
they
say
that
there
has
been
no
conflict
in
this
--
or
is
there
is
anything
the
record
indicate
there
is
any
conflict
in
the
sense
that
the
drill
vessels
are
arguing
with
one
another
about
who
can
make
arrests
or
is
there
any
actual
physical
conflict
of
any
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
are
right
about
that,
there
will
never
be
need
for
the
counterclaim,
will
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
clyburn,
let
me
just
ask
you
again,
i
am
little
puzzled
about
the
prejudice
to
the
state
of
texas.
if
you
win,
you
won’t
be
hurt
by
not
being
able
to
file
a
counterclaim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
is
up
to
the
government,
and
if
you
lose,
don’t
you
have
two
bites
of
the
apple
in
effect
with
regard
to
the
area
within
three
miles.
you
have
only
lost
in
the
area
of
3-9
you
still
have
all
your
arguments
for
within
the
three-mile
belt.
i
have
a
little
difficulty
seeing
the
prejudice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn’t
that
the
same
parole
14.29
that
is
existed
for
the
last
100
years...
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
possible
to
infer
that
you
may
have
raised
the
issue
by
asking
certain
questions
in
written
interrogatories
and
all?
