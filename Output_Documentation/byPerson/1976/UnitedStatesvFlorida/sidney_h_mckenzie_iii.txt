mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if,
in
fact,
the
sovereign
immunity
is,
as
the
federal
government
asserts,
absolute
but
for
statutory
waiver,
then
indeed
we
probably
do
like
the
right
to
assert
this
counterclaim.
if,
however,
as
we
submit
and
as
we
submitted
in
our
memoranda,
the
thekla
case,
decided
by
this
court,
does
open
the
door,
even
a
crack
to
counterclaims.
in
order
to
completely
determine
an
issue
where
the
federal
government
enters
into
litigation
and
where
there
is
no
danger
to
the
public
interest
then
this
is
the
most
appropriate
case
to
apply
that
doctrine
in
the
thekla.
in
that
case,
this
court
asserted
the
reasons
that
have
prevailed
against
creating
a
government
liability
in
tort
do
not
apply
to
a
case
like
this
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
reasons
are
strong
for
not
obstructing
the
application
of
natural
justice
against
the
government
by
technical
formulas,
when
justice
can
be
done
without
endangering
any
public
interest.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
i
am
reading
from
luckenbach
steamship
versus
the
norwegian
barque,
the
thekla.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
submit
what
the
shaw
case
did
was
simply
state
that
the
thekla
should
not
be
interpreted
as
throwing
the
gates
open
wide
to
counterclaims
against
the
federal
government,
and
i
do
not
think
it
does,
and
i
do
not
think
the
language
of
it
should
be
interpreted
as
doing
so.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
did
limit
it
to
the
--
it
distinguished
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
involved
a
liable
involving
vessels
but
in
distinguishing
on
that
factual
basis,
it
simply
said
that
the
case
does
not
throw
the
gates
open
to
counterclaims.
i
do
not
submit
that
it
does
throw
the
gates
open
to
counterclaims.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
well,
except
this
one
as
one
unique
circumstance,
your
honor,
and
it
is
unique.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
i
would
put
on
it
the
limits
of
a
counterclaim
which
one,
does
not
involve
the
expenditure
of
public
funds;
two,
does
not
involve
an
assertion
of
a
right
regarding
federal
property;
and
three,
does
not
interfere
with
public
administration.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
well
if
they
say,
it
involves...
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
but
that
is
not
what
they
said,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
what
if
they
did?
i
would
submit
that
it
still
would
not...
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
well,
unfortunately,
the
arguments
in
their
brief
and
their
arguments
and
the
statements
by
state
department
officials
run
somewhere
non-parallel
to
each
other.
in
their
briefs,
they
argued
that
really
the
reason
you
do
not
want
to
bother
with
this
is
because
if
somebody
comes
in
to
within
three
leagues
they
are
likely
to
be
stopped
by
the
federal
government
out
there
and
they
are
not
likely
to
come
within
three
miles
so
it
is
not
an
issue
that
we
should
be
bothered
with
at
this
time.
their
position
there
really
is
one
of
in
effect
saying
it
is
not
going
to
make
any
difference
in
foreign
affairs.
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
department
officials
who
responded
to
interrogatories
simply
said
that
it
is
their
understanding
that
the
federal
government
has
absolute
and
unilateral
control
over
foreign
nationals
fishing
in
florida
waters
or
any
other
waters.
i
would
submit
that
it
is
really
on
the
basis
of
in
part
federalism
that
we
have
come
before
this
court.
they
have
argued
in
their
argument
on
instituting
the
original
suit
that
within
the
three
mile
to
three-league
area
that
it
is
imperative
that
this
court
decide
the
issue
and
that
they
filed
their
complaint.
the
reason
being
that
if
we
arrest
a
foreign
national
in
that
three
league
to
three
mile
area,
that
it
may
cause
this
court
to
be
faced
with
a
situation
or
it
cause
the
federal
government
to
be
faced
with
a
case
where
we
have
embarrassed
the
federal
government
in
its
international
policy
by
arresting
a
foreign
national
that
they
do
not
feel
we
should
arrest.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
absolutely,
your
honor
and
that
is
exactly
our
point
in
bringing
this
counterclaim.
what
is
true
between
three
miles
and
three
leagues
is
just
as
true
between
the
coastline
and
three
miles.
if
we
can
impair...
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
well,
in
order
to
determine
whether
we
fall
within
what
we
feel
as
the
exception
to
the
absolute
prohibition
against
counterclaims
as
expressed
in
the
thekla
case.
i
think
you
have
to
address
the
merits
of
our
relief,
what
relief
we
are
seeking.
we
are
seeking
a
pure
declaratory
judgment.
we
are
not
seeking
--
if
the
declaratory
judgment
was
decided,
the
limitations
of
the
relief
would
be
--
if
there
were
any
limitation,
it
would
be
limitation
on
the
states,
not
limitations
on
the
federal
government.
we
recognize
that
federal
government
has
concurrent
power
to
exercise
police
power
within
this
area,
so
that
no
decision
will
be
made
limiting
the
federal
government’s
police
power,
no
monetary
decision
would
be
made
against
the
federal
government.
no
limitation
of
their
administrative
powers
would
be
asserted,
no
embarrassment
would
come
to
the
federal
government
as
in
some
other
cases.
this
is
a
peculiar,
unique
case
where
the
states
of
florida
and
texas
need
an
answer.
they
need
an
answer
to
an
issue
that,
in
basics,
it
was
raised
originally
by
the
federal
government.
that
is
the
basis
of
our
coming
in
to
court.
that
is
the
basis
of
our
seeking
this
litigation
where
we
would
be
placed
in
a
position
where
even
though
a
partial
addressing
of
the
issue
had
been
made,
where
we
would
not
be
able
to
properly
direct
our
people
as
to
what
to
do
or
not
to
do
and
they
have
indicated
to
me
that
they…
yes
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
well,
your
honor,
of
course
something
like
that
would
be
true
in
any
case
where
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
counterclaim
that
a
court
might
go
beyond
the
declaratory
relief
of
the
original
action
but
the
result
would
be
that
by
relying
on
happenstance
and
chance
in
that
way,
the
positions
of
the
parties
would
not
be
set
forth
for
the
benefit
of
the
master
or
for
the
benefit
of
this
court.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
well,
that
is
why
i
say
it
is
a
matter
of
happenstance.
of
course,
that
is
what
we
are
concerned
with.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
were
we
considering
filing
it?
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
not
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
our
people
were
asserting
their
rights
quite
unequivocally,
and
i
think
that
is
what
inspired
the
federal
government
to
bring
this
suit.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
if
they
would
--
yes
and
i
am
saying
if
the
issue
it
should
be…
mr.
sidney
h.
mckenzie
iii
and
that
is
exactly
the
language
of
the
thekla
where
they
said,
it
is
said
that
there
is
no
statute
by
which
the
government
accept
this
liability.
you
joined
in
the
suit
and
then
carried
with
the
acceptance
of
whatever
liability
the
courts
may
decide
to
be
reasonably
incident
to
that
act.
what
we
are
asking
is
that
if
the
court
decides
that
this
is
a
suit
that
should
be
brought,
if
the
issue
of
police
power
in
the
adjacent
coastal
waters
is
a
proper
issue
to
be
before
this
court,
then
it
makes
no
sense
to
decide
half
the
issue
that
it
is
appropriate
without
any
exposure
to
the
federal
government
for
the
master
and
this
court
to
decide
the
entire
issue,
that
it
is
appropriate
that
it
comes
within
all
doctrines
of
judicial
expediency,
one
of
point
which
was
raised
by
the
justice
department
in
earlier
case
today
that
multiple
litigation
is
something
that
they
36.22.
and
i
suggest
that
if
they
36.25
in
that
case,
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
uphold
it
in
this
case
your
honor.
thank
you.
