mr.
william
f.
sheehan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
have
in
mind
discussing
the
recent
legislation
that
my
opponent
referred
to,
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
postpone
that
discussion
until
a
more
appropriate
part
of
my
argument.
the
issue
that
is
now
before
the
court
is
quite
a
narrow
one.
the
issue
is
simply
should
the
court
grant
the
motion
of
the
defendant
states
for
leave
to
file
their
purposed
counterclaim?
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
the
states
have
taken
the
position
that
they
do
have
those
rights.
they
assert
that
their
authority
in
this
connection
to
either
at
least
in
part
from
the
1953
submerged
lands
act.
that
act,
of
course,
granted
to
the
states'
rights
on
the
natural
resources
within
the
territorial
sea,
granted
to
all
of
the
coastal
states
those
rights
in
the
territorial
sea
and
as
to
the
states
of
texas
and
florida,
it
granted
those
rights
out
to
a
distance
of
nine
miles
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
defendant
states
are,
therefore,
the
only
states
that
can
assert
a
claim
of
jurisdiction
over
foreign
vessels
beyond
the
territorial
sea
on
the
basis
of
proprietary
interests
granted
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
they
are
indeed
the
only
states
that
have
asserted
in
this
fashion
such
a
claim
and
they
are
accordingly
the
only
states
named
by
the
united
states
as
the
defendants
in
this
suit.
counterclaim
that
the
states
could
bring,
involves
rights
in
the
three-mile
territorial
sea.
those
rights
affect
the
concern
of
every
coastal
state.
we
have
objected
to
that
counterclaim
on
grounds
of
immunity.
our
argument
proceeds
in
four
steps:
first,
that
the
united
states
may
not
be
sued
without
its
consent;
second,
that
the
rule
applied
with
equal
force
when
the
plaintiff
is
a
state;
third,
that
the
united
states
has
not
consented
to
this
lawsuit
by
statute;
and
fourth,
that
it
has
not
consented
to
this
lawsuit
by
virtue
of
having
initiated
a
complaint.
the
first
proposition
needs,
we
think,
very
little
elaboration
as
the
court
stated
last
term
in
testan
and
it
has
long
been
established
of
course
that
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
is
immune
from
suit,
save,
if
it
consents
to
be
sued.
likewise,
the
second
proposition
is
established
beyond
doubting
our
view,
the
exemption
of
the
united
states
from
being
sued
without
its
consent
extends
to
a
suit
by
a
state.
i
think
the
last
time
this
court
had
occasion
to
state
that
rule
squarely
was
in
hawaii
against
gordon
in
373
united
states
reports.
our
third
proposition
is
that
the
united
states
by
statute
has
not
consented
to
this
suit
and
indeed
the
states
have
never
claimed
otherwise.
in
this
connection,
i
will
raise
the
legislation
enacted
last
october
by
congress
and
i
am
referring
to
the
waiver
of
immunity
that
congress
worked
as
an
amendment
to
the
administrative
procedure
act.
we
have
included
a
copy
of
the
amended
administrative
procedure
act
as
an
appendix
in
our
reply
brief
in
matthews
against
mr.
sanders.
that
waiver
of
immunity
has
no
affect
in
this
case,
which
is
not
a
suit
to
review
agency
action
brought
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
another
piece
of
legislation
that
is
not
referred
to
in
the
brief
is
the
act
last
year
by
congress,
the
fishery
conservation
and
management
act
of
1976.
by
that
act,
congress
extended
its
exclusive
fisheries
jurisdiction
to
a
limit
of
200
miles
from
the
coastline.
that
act
leaves
this
lawsuit
where
it
finds
it
in
section
306
of
the
act,
it
says
explicitly
that
nothing
contained
in
the
act
shall
have
any
impact
either
to
enlarge
or
to
diminish
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states
within
their
boundaries.
that,
of
course,
is
the
issue
posed
by
the
united
states
complaint,
what
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
within
their
boundaries
in
the
three
to
nine
mile
area.
there
is
a
provision
for
suit
in
the
act
extending
the
exclusive
fisheries
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
after
200
miles.
that
provision
for
suit
does
not
contemplate
suits
by
states
in
as
much
as
it
provides
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
cases
or
controversies
arising
under
the
act
in
the
district
court.
congress
could
not
have
contemplated
that
that
states
would
sue
under
that
provision
and
as
much
as
the
constitution
gives
this
court
original,
although
not
exclusive,
jurisdiction
over
actions
in
which
state
maybe
a
party.
that
provision
for
suit
also
is
of
no
aid
to
the
states
from
this
case
because
it
provides
only
for
suits
in
the
district
court
not
in
the
supreme
court,
and
finally
it
is
of
no
aid
to
the
states
because
it
does
not
take
effect
until
march
1,
1977.
thus,
the
united
states
has
not,
by
any
statute,
consented
to
be
sued
in
the
matter
that
the
states
seek
to
do
and
so
the
issue
becomes
whether
the
united
states
by
initiating
a
lawsuit
consents
to
be
sued.
it
clearly
has
not.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
yes,
indeed
i
have
two:
one
is
united
states
against
shaw
309
united
states
reports;
and
another
is
united
states
against
united
states
fidelity.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
309
u.s.
reports,
page
495,
and
the
second
is
united
states
against
united
states
fidelity
company,
309
united
states
reports,
506.
there
is
indeed
a
third
case,
nassau
smelting
works
against
united
states,
266
united
states
reports,
page
101.
i
will
read
from
that,
i
will
read
two
sentences
from
that
case.
“the
objection
to
a
suit
against
the
united
states
is
fundamental
whether
it
would
be
in
the
form
of
an
original
action
or
a
setoff
or
a
counterclaim.
jurisdiction
in
either
case
does
not
exist
unless
there
is
specific
congressional
authority
for
it.”
that
is
at
page
6
of
the
government’s
response
to
the
defendants
exception
to
the
report
of
the
special
master,
and
the
other
two
decisions
that
i
just
cited
mr.
justice,
the
shaw
case
and
the
fidelity
corporation
case
are
also
mentioned
in
our
brief.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
well,
i
do
think
the
23.35
mr.
justice.
i
will
add
only
one
statement.
there
is
one…
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
no,
the
special
master
can
decide
the
united
states
complaint
without
reaching
any
of
the
issues
posed
by
the
counterclaim
in
our
view.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
well,
to
the
degree
that
there
is
an
identity
of
issues
as
a
state
asserts
between
the
subject
matter
of
its
counterclaim
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
government’s
complaint
then
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
counterclaim.
that
is
what
you
are
driving
up,
mr.
justice?
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
well,
i
think
that
the
united
states
would
object
in
that.
no,
the
special
master
could
not
give
them
the
relief
that
they
are
asking
for
in
their
counterclaim.
they
are
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
in
their
counterclaim.
if
we
were
to
lose
our
complaints,
the
result
would
be
that
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
in
our
favor.
the
courts
could
not
or
the
special
master
could
not
in
that
case
award
a
declaratory
judgment
that
was
not
asked
for
by
the
state
anymore
than
he
could
award
any
affirmative
relief
on
behalf
of
the
state.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
and
if
we
lose…
mr.
william
f.
sheehan
i
think
it
would,
at
the
very
least,
be
very
strong
precedent
against
the
subject
when
sued
by
the
united
states.
yes,
that
is
certainly
true.
if
there
are
no
questions
that
is
all
i
have.
