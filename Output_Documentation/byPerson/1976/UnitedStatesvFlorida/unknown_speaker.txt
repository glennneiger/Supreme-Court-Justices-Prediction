unknown
speaker
was
there
anything
in
that
legislation
passed
last
october
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
that
you
know
that
congress
passed?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
you
are
not
relying
just
on
your
status
as
a
counter
claimant.
you
are
saying
that
the
other
states
who
might
be
implicated
along
the
lines
of
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
should
also
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
the
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
quote
from
the
government’s
brief
largely
based
on
our
opinion
last
year
on
the
testan
case,
where
we
pretty
much
took
the
same
position
that
there
maybe
a
more
enlightened
view
that
sovereign
immunity
be
abrogated
but
it
is
not
up
to
this
court
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
could
you,
perhaps
10.51
you
would
ask
the
other
side,
but
what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
united
states’
theory
with
respect
to
the
area
outside
the
three–mile
zone.
unknown
speaker
you
are
claiming
the
right
after
the
three
marine
leagues?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
their
position
is?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
is
a
different
--
if
they
deny
your
right
within
three
miles,
it
is
for
a
different
reason
than
outside.
unknown
speaker
i
am
wondering
if
the
grounds
urged
are
different.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
both
within
and
without
three
miles
their
idea
is
that
this
has
foreign
relations
implication?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
they
draw
a
difference
between
navigation
and
fishing?
unknown
speaker
do
you
as
in
terms
of
what
your
rights
are?
unknown
speaker
to
exclude
a
foreign
ship.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
the
position
of
every
single
other
coastal
state.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right,
that
14.23
along
with
every
other
coastal
state
except
for
texas
and
florida
or
in
the
gulf.
unknown
speaker
...for
every
coastal
state?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheehan,
i
wonder
if
you
could
lift
that
microphone
up
a
little
bit.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
case
involving
a
counterclaim
against
the
federal
government.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
case
involving
a
counterclaim
against
the
federal
government
and
sovereign
immunity.
unknown
speaker
309
and
what?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
do
not
think
23.29?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
possible
without
this
for
the
master
to
say
that
in
deciding
your
case,
he
now
decides
against
you
but
he
goes
a
little
step
further.
he
could
not
do
that.
i
mean
could
he
given
this
relief
without
them
asking
for?
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying
he
does
grant
24.12
the
counterclaim
asked
for
without
the
state
asking
for
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying
that
they
did
not
file
the
counterclaim
and
the
case
went
to
judge
and
the
special
master
ruled
against
you
and
gave
them
the
additional
leave
which
they
had
not
even
asked
for.
would
that
be
wrong?
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
sovereignty?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
lose
on
the
merits
of
the
claim
that
you
asserted
in
your
original
complaint
a
fortiori
the
merits
of
the
counterclaim
would
be
decided
against
you,
wouldn’t
it?
you
claimed
that
the
state
has
no
power
to
regulate
fisheries
between
the
three-mile
limit
and
the
three-league
limit
as
i
understand
it
is
that…
unknown
speaker
and...
unknown
speaker
if
the
master
says
and
this
court
ultimately
says,
sorry,
the
state
does
have
a
power
to
regulate
fisheries
between
the
three
miles
and
three
leagues
within
a
fortiori
would
have
power
to
regulate
fisheries
within
the
three
mile.
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
wasn’t
that
pretty
well
limited
to
admiralty
cases
by
the
shaw
case
that
was
decided
later?
unknown
speaker
except
this
one.
unknown
speaker
but
what
limit
would
you
put
on
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
29.12
united
states
says
that
interference
with
what
the
29.16.
unknown
speaker
an
interference
with
the
federal
control
29.22.
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
they
did?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
thought
of
--
what
do
you
understand
the
government’s
theory
is
with
respect
to
the
area
between
three
and
nine
marine
league?
unknown
speaker
well,
don’t
you
think
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
that
if
anyone
on
behalf
of
a
dozen
or
more
states
is
free
to
go
out
and
grappling
hooks
on
a
russian
fishing
boat,
or
panamanian
or
whatever
and
pull
them
into
the
shore
and
hold
the
crew
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
that
all
goes
to
the
merits
of
this
controversy.
we
are
not
here
involved
with
that,
are
we?
unknown
speaker
all
these
things
go
to
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
you
are
right
or
wrong
to
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
possible
that
the
master
and
presumably
this
court
may
accept
the
report,
would
rule
that
the
same
rule
of
law
applies
within
the
three-mile
limit
as
applies
between
the
three
miles
and
the
nine
miles
limit
and
if
he
does,
then
won't
you
get
your
answer
when
the
case
is
all
over?
unknown
speaker
the
other
thing
that
you
are
really
worried
about
is
if
the
court
rules
with
the
government
you
can't
file
a
new
suit
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
unknown
speaker
weren’t
you
considering
filing
the
suit
before
the
federal
government
did?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
and
found
out
you
could
not,
so
you
waited.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
possible,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
is
that
right
now
the
federal
government
withdraws
the
suit.
unknown
speaker
so,
would
your
counterclaim
be
ignored.
unknown
speaker
the
only
way
you
have
got
a
counterclaim
is
because
they
filed
a
suit.
