mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
lee
clyburn
and
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas.
however,
for
purposes
of
the
argument
today,
i
will
be
representing
the
views
of
both
the
states
of
texas
and
florida
since
there
are
no
divergence
or
independent
issues
as
to
those
two
defendant
states.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
defendants
in
this
original
proceeding
will
be
allowed
to
file
a
counterclaim
normally
against
the
united
states
of
america.
the
special
master
has
filed
a
report
recommending
that
the
counterclaim
not
be
filed
because
of
the
united
states
sovereign
immunity.
the
defendant
states
urged
this
court
to
refuse
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
mechanical,
uncritical
manner
advocated
by
the
united
states
and
to
grant
leave
to
file
this
counterclaim
so
that
full
justice
maybe
done
herein.
this
is
strictly
a
lawsuit
for
declaratory
relief.
it
was
originally
filed
by
the
united
states
against
the
states
of
florida
and
texas,
seeking
a
declaration
that
neither
defendant
had
any
right
to
control
fishing
by
foreign
vessels
or
their
crews
in
the
seas
more
than
three
miles
off
their
shores.
the
states
answered
and
opposed
the
united
states’
request
for
declaratory
relief.
the
states
each
assert
that
they
do
possess
the
right
to
enforce
their
laws
at
all
points
within
their
boundaries,
which
boundaries
in
the
case
of
each
of
these
two
states
extend
three
leagues
or
non-geographical
miles
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.
it
became
clear
as
discovery
progressed
in
this
lawsuit
that
the
united
states’
true
position
was
that
the
defendant
states
not
only
did
not
have
any
rights
to
enforce
their
laws
outside
of
three
miles,
but
indeed
that
the
defendant
states
of
florida
and
texas
had
no
rights
to
enforce
their
fisheries
laws
as
against
foreign
nationals
even
in
the
three
mile
zone
between
the
shore
and
three
miles
out
for
the
traditional
territorial
sea
of
the
united
states
have
been
locating.
and
are
to
clear
out
the
whole
question
of
the
respective
rights
of
the
parties
with
regards
to
this
important
issue
of
offshore
law
enforcement
rights.
the
defendants
have
filed
their
joint
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
counterclaim.
by
that
counterclaim,
the
states
seek
only
a
declaration
by
this
court
that
they
each
do
have
the
authority
to
enforce
their
fisheries
laws
as
against
foreign
vessels
and
their
crews
within
three
miles
from
their
shores.
united
states
opposes
the
filing
of
the
counterclaim
relying
primarily
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
united
states
sovereign
immunity
from
sue.
the
special
master
in
his
report
filed
with
this
court
finds
that
the
expeditious
and
orderly
procedures
in
this
lawsuit
would
dictate
the
allowance
of
the
filing
of
the
counterclaim,
but
the
special
master
felt
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
required
him
to
recommend
that
the
counterclaim
not
be
allowed
to
even
be
filed
because
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
defendant
states
fully
concur
with
the
special
master’s
findings
that
absent
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
counterclaim
should
be
allowed.
we
strongly
accept,
however,
to
the
recommendation
of
the
special
master
that
the
counterclaim
should
be
barred
by
operation
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
no
case
known
to
the
defendants
requires
acceptance
of
the
united
states’
position
on
this
matter.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
your
honor,
we
feel
not.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
solicitor
general
is
going
to
explicitly
bring
that
tort
decision
to
the
court's
--
that
statute
to
the
court’s
attention
for
whatever
bearing
it
might
have.
i,
myself,
do
not
feel
that
it
has
bearing
on
the
issue
today
or
further
the
counterclaim
should
be
allowed.
we
feel
that
only
an
absolutely
uncritical
adherence
to
the
most
technical
view
of
the
position
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
our
country
would
require
or
even
allow
the
result
urged
by
the
united
states.
on
the
other
hand,
the
filing
and
adjudication
of
the
counterclaim
would
allow
the
entire
disagreement
between
the
parties
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
lawsuit
and
that
full
justice
could
be
done
herein
to
all
parties
to
this
lawsuit
and
not
just
to
the
united
states.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
is
true
that
the
issue
that
we
raise
in
our
counterclaim
would
probably
be
of
interest
to
the
other
coastal
states
as
well
as
merely
to
our
two
states
or
defendants
in
this
lawsuit.
it
is,
however,
our
position
that
they
should
certainly
not
stand
in
the
way
of
the
filing
for
it.
the
issue,
is
of
very
great
importance
to
these
states
in
this
lawsuit,
and
it
seems
to
us
almost
incredible
that
united
states
would
say
that
it
should
not,
that
the
counterclaim
should
not
be
filed
merely
because
other
states’
legitimate
interest
would
be
called
into
question
by
the
counterclaim.
they
have
called
into
question
and
now
they
refuse
to
allow
the
issue
to
be
adjudicated.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
i
really
do
not
know
what
our
position
would
be
if
other
states
sought
to
intervene,
your
honor.
i
do
not,
what
i
am
saying
that
it
is
of
interest
to
us,
it
is
legitimately
raised
in
this
lawsuit
and
we
should
be
able
to
adjudicate
it
by
counterclaim.
if
other
states
sought
to
intervene,
the
court
would
have
to
deal
with
that
question;
united
states
would
have
to
respond
to
that
at
that
time.
the
united
states
in
its
brief
to
this
court
makes
the
following
statement
that
clearly
demonstrates
what
we
feel
is
the
arrogance
and
unyielding
nature
of
its
position,
and
i
quote
from
page
7
of
their
brief.
“in
sum,
defendants’
arguments
that
adjudication
of
their
counterclaim
is
imperative
less
justice
be
denied,
misses
the
point.”
now,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
for
reasons
best
known
to
the
government
they
fit
for
the
word
“justice”
in
that
page
from
their
brief.
be
that
as
it
may,
it
seems
to
defendants
that
in
this
court
inquiries
and
to
the
justice
and
fairness
of
a
given
result
never
miss
the
point.
to
the
contrary,
that
inquiry,
that
inquiry
as
to
what
is
fair
and
what
is
just,
should
always
be
exactly
the
point
and
it
is
on
that
point
that
united
states’
position
completely
fails.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
your
honor,
they
do
cite
the
court’s
opinion
immediately
after
the
quote
that
i
read.
it
is
the
states’
position,
however,
that
the
case
is
cited
and
all
of
the
cases
indeed
reported
and
relied
upon
for
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
where
cases
are
distinguishable
from
this
one
in
the
effect,
the
possible
effect
that
the
filing
of
either
the
suit
or
counterclaim
might
have
on
the
united
states.
in
this
lawsuit
our
position
that
the
counterclaim
would
have
no
adverse
effect
or
embarrassment
to
the
united
states
whatsoever.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
yes,
your
honor.
in
our
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
counterclaim,
we
set
out
and
we
quote
from
answers
to
interrogatories
and
from
deposition
testimony
for
in
the
united
states
does
deny
that
right,
it
is
their
response...
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
and
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no
both
as
to
the
belt
within
three
miles
and
as
to
the
area
outside
of
three
miles,
at
least,
as
far
as
the
state
of
texas
is
concerned.
i
would
point
out
that
the
state
of
texas,
has
filed
in
its
answer
an
allegation
that
no
justiceable
case
or
controversy
as
to
it
exist
and
it
is
for
precisely
the
reason
that
there
has
not
been
any
clashes
between
the
10.18
boats
of
the
lights,
between
the
state
of
texas
and
the
united
states
that
we
raise
that
point
in
defense
to
this
lawsuit.
so,
the
states’
position,
in
a
nutshell,
is
that
there
is
no
justiceable
case
or
controversy
as
to
texas
with
regards
to
the
united
states’
original
request
for
the
declaratory
relief.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
absolutely,
your
honor.
if
the
united
states’
case
is
dismissed,
we
will
not
be
in
the
position
or
care
to
pursue
our
counterclaim.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
well,
your
honor,
it
is
not
clear
in
my
mind,
to
be
honest
with
the
court,
but
it
is
my
understanding
there
has
to...
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
as
i
can
understand
their
position
is
linked
to
the
notion
that
the
territory
of
sea
of
united
states
has
traditionally
been
three
miles
and
that
action
beyond
that
could
have
implications
that
they
say
would
have
more
effect
on
them
than
our
actions
within
three
miles.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
think
i
might
have
not
been
plain
in
my
answer.
i
think
their
distinction
is
to
why
they
should…
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
not
really,
your
honor.
i
was
confused
in
my
earlier
response.
apparently,
they
do
not
think
there
is
any
difference
in
our
rights
within
three
miles
and
outside.
at
least,
that
is
what
they
said
repeatedly
in
the
discovery
that
i
have
alleged
that
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
i
understand
and
what
they
are
saying
to
us
is
that
although
we
feel
you
do
not
have
it
anywhere
just
for
reasons
best
known
to
us,
we
only
won't
let
you
litigate
with
this
right
now
in
the
area
outside
of
three,
between
three
and
nine,
and
that
is
what
we
do
not
think
is
fair.
an
examination
of
the
affects
of
the
filing
of
our
counterclaim...
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
fishing
is
the
only
issue
that
they
raised
in
their
lawsuit
or
that
we
mentioned
in
our
counterclaim.
i
think
that
the
traditional
law
of
the
sea
makes
distinctions
between
the
rights
of
fishing
and
the
rights
of
navigation.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
yes,
yes
your
honor.
for
example,
we
would
never
seek
to
prevent
innocent
passage.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
absolutely
not.
if
they
were
engaged
in
innocent
passage
and
no
one
is
ever
alleged,
we
have
13.04.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
if
we
prevail
on
the
merits
of
the
lawsuit?
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
probably
not,
probably
not
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
the
prejudice
your
honor,
it
would
come
in
and
we
feel
in
various
ways;
first
and
not
of
ultimate
importance
in
this
court
but
a
very
rare
one
to
the
states
would
be
that
it
would
subject
us
to
the
very
real
possibility
of
repeat
litigation
a
few
years
now
when
they
decide
to
sue
us
only
in
a
belt.
that
would
be
unfair.
but
more
fundamentally,
more
fundamentally,
were
we
to
lose
on
the
merits
of
their
original
complaint
and
be
denied
our
right
to
file
and
litigate
our
counterclaim,
we
would
be
in
the
position
of
not
knowing
of
whether
we
could
legitimately
enforce
our
rights
within
three
miles
and
we
would
be
in
the
position
of
doing
so
or
14.14
that
very
least
having
a
lawsuit
filed
against
by
the
united
states
when
they
chose
to
do
so.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
it
would
seem
so
and
our
rights...
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
we
do
not
think
so
your
honor
because
to
my
knowledge
the
recent
developments
in
this
lawsuit
when
the
first
time
the
united
states
just
come
right
out
and
told
us
we
do
not
think
you
have
any
rights
at
all
to
enforce
your
laws
against
foreign
nationals
anywhere
offshore.
that’s
14.48
me
and
i
thank
you
14.50
to
everyone
who
learned
of
that.
i
think
in
that
regard
it
would
be
a
different
situation.
the
filing
of
the
other
counterclaim
do
not
possibly
have
any
adverse
effect
upon
the
united
states.
now,
one
penny
of
monetary
judgment
is
sought
against
15.09
of
the
counterclaim.
we
do
not
seek
to
force
them
to
deal
in
any
particular
way
with
any
federal
property
to
deed
it
to
us
or
to
deed
it
to
anybody
else
or
to
refrain
from
doing
anything
they
want
to
with
any
other
property.
very
significantly,
we
do
not
seek
to
have
them
ousted
from
jurisdiction
to
enforce
fisheries
regulations
at
any
point,
anywhere
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
it
is
a
position
of
the
states
and
always
has
been.
the
states
and
the
federal
government
possess
concurrent
jurisdiction
within
the
entire
belt
to
enforce
their
laws
against
any
violators.
we
are
not
seeking
to
hurt
the
united
states.
i
have
already
told
you.
our
view
of
the
harm
and
prejudice
would
come
to
us
and
the
basic
unfairness
of
when
the
united
states
waive
the
banner
of
sovereign
immunity
without
even
attempting
to
give
us
or
this
court
or
anyone,
any
logical
reason
as
opposed
to
a
dogmatic
assertion
of
it
as
means
of
avoiding
litigation
of
the
full
subject
matter
that
they
have
brought
into
issue
by
filing
this
lawsuit.
mr.
lee
c.
clyburn
well,
your
honor,
we
--
16.26
interrogators
16.27
to
get
at
the
distinction
they
had
raised
in
their
lawsuit
by
suing
us
only
outside
of
three
or
asked
them
to
try
to
file
the
logical
basis
for
their
choice
of
suing
us
only
outside
of
three
rather
than
all
the
way
into
the
shore
and
it
is
in
response
that
they
said
you
do
not
have
any
rights.
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
outlined
we
urge
the
court
not
accept
the
united
states’
dogmatic
view
of
sovereign
immunity
and
to
allow
the
filing
of
this
counterclaim
so
that
the
full
issues
can
be
litigated
in
this
lawsuit.
