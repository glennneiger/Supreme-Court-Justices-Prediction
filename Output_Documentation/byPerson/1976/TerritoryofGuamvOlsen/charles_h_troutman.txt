mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
essence
of
this
case
is
the
ability
of
the
territory
of
guam
to
determine
for
itself
the
type
of
court
system
it
desires
for
its
own
local
cases.
the
specific
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
section
22
of
the
organic
act
of
guam,
which
is
48
united
states
code
1424,
permits
the
legislature
of
the
guam
to
create
an
appellate
division
or
rather
create
supreme
court
of
guam
and
transfer
from
the
appellate
division
of
the
district
court
to
the
supreme
court
of
guam
all
appeals
from
the
lower
courts
of
the
territory.
a
brief
history
of
this
litigation
i
believe
is
in
order.
first,
in
1974,
the
twelfth
guam
legislature
decided
that
it
was
time
to
have
the
local
court
system
in
its
opinion
anyhow
as
autonomous
as
the
rest
of
the
government
had
become.
in
1950
the
organic
act
created
a
civil
government
for
the
territory
of
guam
and
created,
at
that
time,
a
legislator
having
legislative
authority
of
raw
matters
of
local
interest.
a
governor
of
guam
is
also
created
who
is
an
appointed
official,
appointed
by
the
president,
answerable
to
the
interior
department,
and
section
22
of
the
organic
act
created
a
court
system
similar
too
but
significantly
different
from
that
in
the
other
territories,
probably
most
similar
to
that
of
the
old
years
on
the
territory.
then
there
were
certain
significant
amendments
in
1951
and
1958
which
i
shall
discuss
later,
and
then
in
1970
the
elective
governor
act
was
adopted
which
gave
guam
its
first
elected
governor,
elected
locally.
then,
in
1974,
the
legislature
of
guam
and
then
that
the
local
codes
of
guam
which
had
previously,
by
the
first
guam
legislature,
created
the
appellate
division
of
the
district
court.
it
amended
these
laws
to
provide
for
a
supreme
court
of
guam
and
a
superior
court
which
was
then
the
superior
court
being
the
court
of
local
jurisdiction.
as
soon
as
a
case
could
go
through
the
process
then
superior
court,
it
came
up
for
appeal
before
the
supreme
court,
this
was
the
agana
bay
versus
dullingham
(ph)
case,
and
as
soon
as
the
supreme
court
had
received
it
the
agana
bay
company
petitioned
to
the
district
court
of
guam
to
issue
a
writ
of
prohibition
declaring
that
the
supreme
court
of
guam
has
no
authority
to
hear
appeals
of
any
sort
of
lower
court
activity.
district
court
of
guam
then
granted
this
writ
which
was
there
upon
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
in
january
17th,
1976
the
ninth
circuit,
a
panel
three
judges
reversed
the
district
court
saying
that
the
supreme
court
under
the
organic
act
did
have
a
right
to
exist
and
hear
cases
on
appeal.
meanwhile
the
respondent
in
this
case
also
had
been
convicted
in
the
superior
court
of
various
crimes
burglary,
receiving
stolen
property,
and
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
he
had
appealed
both
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
district
court
on
the
generally
held
belief
at
that
time
that
no
one
knew
which
court
would
hear
the
appeal.
as
soon
as
the,
agana
bay
decision
came
down,
the
district
court
then
reversed
or
rather
denied
the
appeal
in
the
olsen
case
saying
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
this
denial
was
then
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
before
the
ninth
circuit
could
act
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
by
the
respondents
in
this
action
which
was
denied,
then
the
ninth
circuit
en
banc
without
further
brief
of
their
argument
reversed
the
opinion
in
the
agana
bay
declaring
that
the
supreme
court
of
guam
could
not
hear
and
have
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
appeals,
because
the
guam
legislature
have
no
power
to
create
one
under
the
organic
act.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
they
are
completely
separate,
your
honor
except
that
the
issue
involved
is
the
same.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
oh,
yes,
except
for
the
police
court
and
that
only
for
the
incumbent.
the
current
--
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
yes,
for
the
one
judge.
actually
they
were
not
to
the
bar
of
guam
your
honor,
because
the
composition
of
the
new
court,
the
supreme
court
of
guam
would
have
been
almost
identical
to
that
of
the
appellate
division
of
the
district
court.
in
that
the
chief
justice
was
the
only
justice
appointed
and
he
was
the
member
of
the
bar
and
had
to
be
member
of
the
bar
of
guam,
but
he
would
designate
two
other
associate
justices
from
among
a
group
which
would
include
the
district
judge
with
his
consent,
non
involved
judges
of
the
superior
court,
or
one
of
the
judges
of
the
high
court
of
the
trust
territory
with
their
consent.
it
is
the
same
way
that
the
appellate
division
does
not
constitute
it
under
the
organic
act
of
guam
section
22
(a)
the
second
paragraph.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
no,
your
honor,
there
are
no
article
iii
courts
applicable
to
guam
as
original
or
appellate
jurisdiction
on
the
island.
the
only
article
iii
court
that
is
involved
in
guam
cases
is
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
no,
your
honor.
that
is
a
legislative
court
created
by
the
organic
act
of
guam
in
1950.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
correct
because
the
supreme
court
did
not
exist.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
collateral
questions,
the
district
court
of
guam
your
honor
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
cases
which
arise
under
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
arising
under
--
and
of
course
the
income
tax,
but
other
issues,
yes.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
up
to
a
point
your
honor,
not
on
direct
appeal.
we
believe
--
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
well,
in
a
criminal
case
your
honor,
we
would
believe
that
it
could
be
brought
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
civil
case
that
presents
more
of
a
problem.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
correct.
at
the
time
the
guam
legislature
passed
the
act,
the
court
reorganization
act,
they
also
passed
the
resolution
requesting
congress
to
amend
the
organic
act
to
provide
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
it
does,
yes,
completely.
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
correct,
and
the
appeal
is
now
pending
--
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
no,
the
authority,
i
would
say
would
be
that
there
is
no
authority
to
create
this
court.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
correct.
that
is
what
i
mean,
but
the
original
decision
actually
in
agana
bay
said
that
there
was
no
authority
to
create
the
court.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
yes
your
honor
it
would
be
because
the
organic
act
states
that
the
-
to
begin
with
-
that
the
district
court
of
guam
shall
have
such
appellate
jurisdiction
as
the
legislature
of
guam
determines.
so,
that
if
the
legislature
of
guam
did
not
determined
any
jurisdiction
regardless
of
what
else
it
created,
if
it
did
not
act
to
determine
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
then
it
would
not
have
any.
this
is
sort
of
a
question
that
we
are
facing
with
many
cases
right
now
because
the
case
below
has
said
that
the
legislature
cannot
transfer
jurisdiction
from
the
appellant
division
to
a
supreme
court
yet,
but
the
legislature
has
done
this
repeal
any
authorization
of
jurisdiction
to
the
district
court
and
has
not
yet
acted
to
replace
it
with
anything.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
in
any
court,
that
is
unfortunately
the
case,
yes.
the
organic
act
of
guam
is
quite
different
from
the
act
of
the
virgin
islands
and
other
territories.
most
of
the
early
western
territories,
actually
expect
arizona,
provided
a
complete
court
system.
they
set
up
a
supreme
court,
district
courts,
probate
courts,
justice
of
the
peace
courts.
in
arizona,
however,
they
set
up
a
court
which
said
--
they
set
up
a
district
court
with
such
other
inferior
courts
as
the
legislature
may
or
may
not
determine.
in
the
virgin
islands
today,
the
legislature
of
the
virgin
islands
today
only
has
authority
to
create
inferior
courts
and
also
has
very
limited
authority
to
create
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
it
does
create.
but,
on
guam
the
congress
has
said
no
such
thing.
there
is
no
--
the
judicial
authority
of
guam
is
rested
in
not
only
the
district
court,
but
in
such
court
or
courts
as
the
legislature
may
create.
there
is
no
word
anywhere
in
the
judiciary
section
of
the
organic
act
which
would
act
to
mention
the
word
?inferior
court?
or
should
otherwise
limit
the
legislature
in
the
type
of
courts
that
it
would
create.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
on
the
guam
constitution
relatively
limited
i
believe
your
honor,
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is
that
it
applies
only
to
guam
constitution
which
has
not
yet
been
written
and
the
constitutional
convention
will
be
called,
for
later
this
year,
june
and
under
the
time
table
congress
would
not
receive
it
until
possibly
early
1978,
but
there
are
presently
approximately
40
cases
on
appeal
wherever
waiting
decision
on
this
case
in
the
courts
of
guam.
so
that
there
are
--
we
are
talking
now
about
existing
law
not
as
what
it
may
be
after
the
guam
constitution
has
come
about.
the
second
part
of
that
question,
your
honor,
from
the
history
of
the
1976
legislation
that
passed
would
indicate
the
reason
for
section
2
(b)
(7)
regarding
the
courts,
was
not
so
much
that
congress
is
trying
to
interpret
the
existing
organic
act
just
because
they
were
at
a
quandary
to
know
how
to
interpret
the
situation
in
light
of
this
continuing
litigation,
because
at
that
time,
and
the
time
that
was
inserted
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
en
banc
decision,
had
come
down
but
certiorari
had
not
yet
been
granted.
so,
they
assume
that
that
decision
was
final
and
acted
accordingly.
i
think
that
the
congressional
intent
if
you
can
find
any
in
the
original
organic
act
is
not
as
respondents
would
urge
that
guam
could
not
barred
completely
from
creating
this
type
of
court.
congress
originally
considered
two
versions
of
the
organic
act
two
or
three
in
which
they
created
in
these
proposals
various
forms
of
a
court
system
similar
to
a
state
court
system,
in
other
words
they
said
this
is
the
system
and
treated
it
more
as
a
constitution.
however,
they
rejected
all
of
these
versions
and
came
out
with
what
is
now
22
(a)
of
the
organic
act,
plus
other
parts
which
have
since
been
amended.
in
fact
later
in
1951
when
they
realized
how
much
appellate
jurisdiction
the
legislature
had
given
them,
they
were
forced
to
amend
the
judiciary
section
so
that
appeals
would
go
from
the
appellant
division
to
the
ninth
circuit
as
it
was
desired
at
that
time
to
the
simpler
reason
that
before
the
1951
amendment
there
is
a
limited
right
of
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
matters
and
felonies
and
in
excess
of
$3,000.
now,
everything
below
that
was
not
appealable
but
these
were
just
the
matters
that
were
being
appealed
to
the
appellant
division
of
the
district
court,
so
there
is
a
desire
that
they
were
not
embarrass
at
that
time.
then
in
1958
it
was
determined
that
with
the
increasing
amount
of
appeals
again
the
former
system
of
assigning
judges
to
the
district
court
was
still
found
workable
chiefly
because
of
the
distance
they
were
assigned
by
the
chief
justice
of
this
court,
and
also
they
came
from
article
iii
courts
of
the
united
states.
so,
it
was
amended
to
provide
the
designation
of
associate
judges
for
this
appellate
division
would
be
provided
by
the
presiding
judge
of
the
appellate
division
from
among
judges
able
to
sit
on
the
district
court,
namely
judges
who
had
been
designated
by
either
the
chief
justice
or
the
presiding,
the
chief
judge
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
also
from
judges
of
the
high
court
of
the
trust
territory
which
incidentally
has
no
judicial
jurisdiction
over
guam
whatsoever.
it
is
also
interesting
for
comparison
to
note
the
government
of
the
northern
mariana
has
recently
passed
also.
while
there
they
did
provide
for
the
proper
route
to
appeal
to
an
article
iii
court,
they
did
that
because
all
of
the
parties
were
then
knowledgeable
that,
were
then
quite
aware
that
the
northern
marianas
would
probably
eventually
be
creating
its
own
courts.
but
the
language
giving
jurisdiction
to
its
appellant
division
is
very
similar
to
that
found
in
the
organic
act
of
guam.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
it
is
on
page
5
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
no,
authorizing
the
appellant
division.
we
are
not
here
talking
about
the
authority
of
the
guam
to
create
lower
courts,
in
other
words
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
but
section
402
(c)
says
that
district
court
--
and
i
am
referring
to
the
northern
marianas
--
the
district
court
will
have
such
appellate
jurisdiction
as
the
constitutional
or
laws
of
the
northern
mariana
islands
may
provide.
then
they
go
on
to
save
when
it
sits
as
an
appellate
court,
the
district
court
will
consist
of
three
judges,
at
least
one
of
whom
will
be
a
judge
of
the
court
of
record
of
the
northern
mariana
island.
so,
the
first
sentence
of
this
is
very
similar
to
that
in
the
organic
act
of
guam
referring
to
appeals
where
it
says
in
section
22
(a)
talking
about
jurisdiction,
the
district
court
of
--
it
says,
it
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
and
all
other
causes
in
guam,
jurisdiction
over
which
has
not
been
transferred
by
the
legislature
to
other
courts
established
by
it,
and
shall
have
such
appellant
jurisdiction
as
a
legislature
may
determine.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
yes
your
honor,
i
am,
yes.
that
is
the
point
of
the
comparison.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
no,
i
would
not
your
honor
because
prior
to
that
statement
the
full
sentence
reads
that
district
court
of
guam
shall
have
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
and
all
causes
arising
under
the
constitution
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
regardless
of
the
sum
or
value
of
the
matter
in
controversy,
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
in
all
other
causes
in
guam,
jurisdiction
over
which
has
not
been
transferred.
so,
that
the
only
thing
that
can
be
transferred
as
other
causes
is
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
this,
your
honor
i
cannot
rightly
say
because
this
is
currently
in
litigation
at
the
present
time.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that?s
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
the
issue
i
believe
in
diversity
is
that
diversity
basically
is
not
a
cause
arising
under
the
law
of
guam.
that
is
one
argument.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
true.
actually
at
the
present
time
the
district
court
of
guam
as
assumed
that
it
does
have
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
correct
they
are
not.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
under
the
existing
law
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
well,
that
possibly
--
that
particular
question
has
not
been
addressed
in
the
court
reorganization
act
because
its
jurisdictional
statement
is
that,
jurisdiction
lies
in
the
superior
court
in
all
cases
arising
under
the
laws
of
guam.
so,
there
actually
is
a
gap
there
of
two
types
of
cases
which
go
to
the
district
court:
one
type
i
believe
probably
would
be
diversity
since
guam
has
no
provisions
itself
for
diversity
per
se,
and
also
cases
that
probably
arise
under,
say,
another
law
but
i
heard
on
guam,
litigation
is
going
on
one
of
those
at
the
present
time,
for
instance,
which
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
trust
territory
but
the
parties
are
found
in
guam
and
the
case
is
pursued
there.
we
would
further
argue
that
the
appeal
to
a
district
court
advanced
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
not
actually
a
matter
of
right
that
was
established
by
the
original
organic
act.
under
the
original
organic
act
there
was
no
right
to
appeal
to
the
district
courts
to
begin
with.
this
right
had
to
be
made
when
it
was
made
by
the
legislature
of
guam.
this
was
done
in
the
first
guam
legislature
by
a
really
a
clerk
--
separate
divisions
what
they
called
it
an
appellant
division
of
the
district
court,
but
that
was
a
creature
of
guam
and
not
of
the
organic
act.
our
argument
further
is
that
the
subsequent
amendments
do
not,
in
essence,
repeal
or
admit
that
right
of
guam
to
change
its
original
act
in
the
first
place.
in
other
words,
the
second
paragraph
of
section
22
of
the
organic
act,
where
it
starts
appeals
to
the
district
court
of
guam
shall
be
heard
and
determined
by
an
appellant
division
and
so
forth,
this
does
not
state
that
appeals
cannot
be
heard
any
place
else,
but
merely
provides
the
system
that
is
developed
that
should
be
heard
if
and
assuming
the
guam
legislature
continuously
appeals
to
the
appellant
division.
guam
has
progressed
far
in
its
ability
to
organic
act
of
guam
and
we
are
not
arguing
--
our
whole
argument
here
is
that
this
is
permitted
within
the
organic
act
as
it
presently
exists.
in
our
view
the
organic
act
of
guam
represents
maximum
flexibility
to
guam
in
determining
the
form
of
government
for
the
territory
in
a
much
greater
degree
than
it
has
been
provided
by
the
organic
acts
of
the
various
others
territories
and
possessions.
in
the
florida
case
i
cited
in
our
brief
is
the
american
ocean
insurance
versus
365
bales
of
cottons,
court
back
imply
there
was
territory
ruled
that
the
court,
that
congress
may
give
to
a
territory
either
the
jurisdictions
it
wants
to
in
a
court
system
or
permit
that
territory
to
give
either
what
is
normally
federal
jurisdiction
or
local
jurisdiction
to
a
court
of
its
choice.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
none
your
honor.
because
very
specifically
elsewhere
at
least
in
recent
history
it
spells
out
how
the
courts
are
to
operate.
in
the
virgin
islands
it
is
very
specific
that,
they
state
that
the
local
jurisdiction
may
not,
rather
it
may
create
only
inferior
courts
and
then
it
actually
provides
that
jurisdiction
of
the
rather
appeals
may
be
taken,
rather
shall
be
taken
from
the
lower
courts
created
by
the
jurisdiction
but
this
virgin
island
too
the
district
court
of
the
virgin
islands.
so,
that
this
is
specifically
stated
in
old
hawaii
when
it
was
a
territory,
the
congress
actually
created
the
supreme
court
and
permitted
inferior
courts
to
be
created
and
created
certain
intermediate
courts
also,
but
there
again
referring
to
inferior
courts
as
the
problems
of
the
hawaii
legislature.
in
puerto
rico
under
its
organic
act
days
not
under
the
commonwealth,
of
course,
there
was
a
court
system
created
again
by
the
organic
act
but
giving
inferior
powers
to
the
puerto
rican
legislature.
so
that
actually
we
are
arguing
with
the
guam
organic
act
is
different
from
that
of
other
jurisdictions
and
this
is
why
guam
claims
its
power.
if
we
were
operating
under,
let
us
say,
the
virgin
islands,
hawaii
or
arizona
organic
act,
there
is
no
question
that
guam
could
not
do
what
it
is
presently
doing.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
yes
i
would
--
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
that
is
correct
your
honor,
it
is.
it
is
either
specific
to
limit
of
that
or
in
some
of
the
older
ones
the
whole
set
up,
the
whole
court
system
is
established
by
congress
leaving
no
authority
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
actually
going
to
be
that
much
impact
at
the
moment.
i
think
the
reason
for
this
is
at
what
was
happened
is
covered
adequately
by
the
con-con
act
itself,
in
that
number
one
i
cannot
forecast
what
the
con-con
will
come
up
with.
i
really
have
no
idea
at
this
point.
i
presume
it
will
come
up
with
something
similar
but
this
is
not
--
i
have
no
way
of
telling.
the
history
of
that
section
2
(b)
(7)
indicates
that
the
matter
of
the
relationship
of
whatever
court
is
created
will
be
determined
probably
at
the
time
that
congress
has
approved
the
guam
constitution
and
be
part
of
the
joint
resolution.
this
was
the
intent
by
counselor
at
the
time
of
the
senate
amendment
to
that.
as
through
the
case
that
are
existing
now,
i
do
not
foresee
that
it
will
have
any
effect
whatsoever
in
as
much
as
these
cases,
take
the
criminal
cases,
were
already
in
the
appeal
route
under
existing
laws.
i
do
not
see
how
the
guam
con-con
act
will
be
able
to
reverse
or
change
what
is
presently
the
law?
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
at
the
present
--
under
the
existing
law
your
honor?
under
the
existing
law
the
review
is
to
the
appellant
division
of
the
district
court,
which,
being
a
part
for
the
district
court,
you
have
a
right
to
appeal
automatically
to
the
ninth
circuit
court.
this
is
how
this
case
came
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
in
the
criminal
case
such
as
this,
i
mention
a
review
would
be
by
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
no.
under
the
present
time,
your
honor,
there
would
be
no
direct
review.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
if
assuming
our
position.
mr.
charles
h.
troutman,
iii
your
honor,
there
is
actually
quite
a
bit
of
controversy
on
this
point.
as
the
chief
justice
appointed
a
committee
on
the
pacific
territories
which
held
hearings
in
guam
last
august.
it
seems
to
me
the
view
of
the
bar
of
guam
that
they
would
like
review
to
be,
to
the
ninth
circuit,
since
that
this
would
actually
provide
more
direct,
more
number
of
appeals,
since
the
chances
of
getting
a
review
to
this
court
are
much
less.
thank
you
your
honor.
