certainly
your
construction
does
not
fall
in
what
would
call
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
that
justice
stevens
is
asking
about,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
mean
as
to
the
part
of
section
22
(a)
on
page
2
of
the
petitioner?s
briefs
which
describes
the
original
jurisdiction
and
says
the
jurisdiction
up
of
the
district
court,
and
then
says
jurisdiction
and
appellate
jurisdiction
which
has
been
transferred
by
the
legislature
to
other
courts
or
courts
established
by
it,
and
shall
have
such
appellate
jurisdiction
as
the
legislature
may
it
determine.
now,
that
to
me
sounds
like
carte
blanche.
why
isn?t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not
read
the
statute
literally
and
if
one
does
read
it
literally
it
sounds
to
me
to
give
virtually
unlimited
authority
to
the
guam
legislature
in
this
particular
matter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
the
guam
legislature
determines
that
the
district
court
shall
not
have
appellate
jurisdiction.
