justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
trapp,
let
me
just
modify
the
question
a
little
bit,
then
supposing
that
the
question
is
whether
the
organic
act
would
prevent
the
guam
legislature
from
enacting
two
statutes.
in
the
first
statute,
they
say,
we
hereby
withdraw
all
appellate
jurisdiction
from
the
district
court,
and
that
goes
into
affect,
and
i
guess
they
have
the
power
to
do
that
under
the
organic
act
and
then
secondly,
a
year
later,
they
had
passed
the
statute
saying,
now
appeals
will
be
taken
to
the
newly
created
guam
supreme
court,
and
then
we
knocked
out
the
second
statute,
i
suppose
then
there
would
be
no
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
language
of
the
organic
act
that
would
prevent
the
guam
legislature
from
withdrawing
entirely
the
appellate
jurisdiction
of
the
existing
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
judge
kennedy
had
read
the
word
?determine?
as
i
understand
his
opinion
to
mean
that
there
is
at
least
some
category
of
patty
matters,
smaller
matters
as
to
which
there
need
be
no
appeal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
that
means
they
can
determine
that
there
will
be
minor
matters
as
to
which
should
be
no
appeal
but
they
could
not
determine
that
there
will
be
no
appeals
at
all.
