unknown
speaker
agana
bay
and
this
case
are
two
wholly
separate
cases,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
is
the
personnel
of
the
new
courts
established
in
guam
confined
to
persons
admitted
to
the
bar
of
guam.
in
other
words
if
judges
have
to
be
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
just
as
grandfather
clause.
unknown
speaker
when
the
second
paragraph
refers
then
to
three
judges
of
the
district
court
of
guam,
it
is
not
talking
about
three
federal
district
judges,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
so,
even
the
district
court
of
guam
is
not
an
article
iii
court.
unknown
speaker
and
its
decisions
are
appealable
to
the
ninth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
supreme
court
of
guam.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
federal
--
under
this
plan
you
would
support
there
would
be
--
there
were
many
questions
that
would
end
up
to
supreme
court
of
guam
subject
to
no
federal
review.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
the
arising
under
--
unknown
speaker
but
any
federal
defenses
would
never
be
subject
to
federal
review.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
a
federal
constitutional
defense
to
a
case
in
a
guam
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
civil
cases?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
submissions
--
it
is
not
appealable
to
any
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
but
until
that
has
done
there
would
be
no
appeal.
unknown
speaker
1983
applies
to
guam.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
assure.
i
gather
if
his
decision
blow
stands,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
supreme
court
of
guam.
unknown
speaker
is
this
because
the
statute
has
been
read
to
mean
that
there
was
no
authority
to
create
this
court,
or
that
there
was
no
authority
to
give
it
any
jurisdiction
to
appeals.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
or
no
authority
to
transfer
any
appellate
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
general
troutman,
following
up
on
justice
white?s
question,
under
your
view
of
the
organic
act,
what
is
have
been
possible
to
create
a
local
court
to
try
local
matters
and
have
no
appellate
review
whatsoever
of
that
court?s
decision?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
we
merely
hold
that
the
supreme
court
of
guam
is
not
properly
constituted
under
the
present
state
of
the
law,
there
would
be
a
trial
in
a
guam
court
with
no
review
of
the
federal
question
in
any
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
what
if
any
effect
on
this
case
does
that
1976
legislation,
congressional
legislation
have?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
your
brief?
i
think
it
is
in
you
brief?
unknown
speaker
the
language
authorizing
the
creation
of
other
courts
is
very
similar.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
right
that
you
say
is
similar
to,
it
will
have
such
appellant
jurisdiction
as
to
constitutional
laws
that
the
northern
mariana
islands
may
provide.
you
are
making
that
comparison.
unknown
speaker
general
troutman
may
i
ask
one
of
the
question
that
the
language
you
just
read,
the
transfer
of
original
jurisdiction
language,
that
is
broad
enough
to
cover
as
i
would
read
it
i
think
at
least,
transfer
of
cases
arising
under
federal
law,
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
do
to
diversity
of
the
cases?
unknown
speaker
yes
because
it
is
contradictory,
isn?t
it
about
diversity,
whether
it
would
be.
it
cannot
--
both
have
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
district
court
and
still
be
transferable
to
another
court?
unknown
speaker
you
can
retire
what
are
mutual.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
says
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
well
then
diversity
cases
are
not
transferable,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
somebody
even
though
another
court
system,
the
local
court
system
is
set
up,
the
suitor
have
the
choice
then.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
understand
why
diversity
case
is
not
transferable.
i
understand
your
answer
is
the
cases
are
rising
under
federal
law
but
there
is
nothing
in
here
about
diversity
cases
not
being
transferable.
unknown
speaker
what
other
choice
has
congress
given
to
the
jurisdiction
which
you
claim,
was
given
here
to
guam?
unknown
speaker
because
under
those
acts
the
authority
is
limited
to
creating
non-appellate
courts?
unknown
speaker
to
creating
so-called
inferior
courts.
unknown
speaker
well
i
have
interrupted
you,
may
i
ask,
you
do
not
need
to
answer
it
now,
but
i
wonder
if
you
are
going
to
address
to
yourself
to
the
impact
upon
this
case,
if
any,
of
the
newly
authorized
constitutional
convention
the
con-con
authorization
that
said,
do
not
forget
--
unknown
speaker
how
would
a
case
in
the
local
court
get
federal
review
at
any
direct
federal
review?
unknown
speaker
under
your
view
of
the
jurisdiction
how
would
one
get
to
the
direct
federal
review?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
direct
review?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
correct
then?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
if
you
are
correct.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
more
question
before
you
sit
down?
you
indicated
there
was
--
the
consideration
has
been
given
to
the
problem
of
providing
direct
review
from
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
guam.
is
that
--
also
that
review
would
be
in
the
ninth
circuit
or
in
this
court,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
which
will
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
guam?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
just
saying
that
when
the
congress
said,
it
shall
have
such
appellate
jurisdiction
as
the
legislature
may
determine,
they
were
saying,
it
will
have
some
appellate
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought
it
was.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words
it
is
not
the
grant
of
power
as
under
article
iii
of
the
federal
constitution
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
but,
there
is
some
dispute
over
what
is
the
scope
of
the
congressional
power
as
to
article
iii,
it
has
never
been
finally
resolved.
unknown
speaker
the
other
two
judges,
the
territorial
judges,
when
they
fit
in
the
slot?
what
slot
do
they
fit
in?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
within
ninth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
it
is
outside.
unknown
speaker
in
what
tribunal
this
rested
the
traditional
probate
jurisdiction,
such
as
we
have
in
the
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
sense
congress
has
not
let
go
the
federal
courts
either,
has
it
then?
unknown
speaker
not
even
for
a
day.
unknown
speaker
subject
to
monitoring
of
the
senate.
unknown
speaker
mr.
trapp,
i
just
wonder
should
we
--
if
we
were
to
make
a
presumptions
one
way
or
another
as
to
whether
guam
is
capable
of
self-government,
which
presumptions
should
we
make
that
it
is
or
that
it
is
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
way
the
appellate
division
of
the
district
court
works.
don?t
they
sit
in
the
panel
of
three
reviewing
the
decisions
of
one
of
the
three?
unknown
speaker
but
the
procedure
permits
that
to
happen
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
the
very
procedure
you
are
criticizing
in
other
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
that
if
congress
were
to
authorize
guam
to
have
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
of
guam
and
no
further
appeals
to
any
article
iii
court
or
did
i
misunderstand?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
reconcile
that
with
the
cases
which
you
have
cited
in
your
brief
on
page
35,
where
territorial
or
appeals
from
territorial
courts
in
the
western
state
54;01
to
this
court
were
limited
to
$2000
or
$3000
in
amount.
now,
if
your
controversy
was
not
more
than
$2000
and
you
are
appealing
from
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
you
could
not
get
to
an
article
iii
court.
unknown
speaker
does
that
suggest
that
congress
could
nullify
this
very
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
for
congress
to
decide
and
determined.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn?t
that
just
mean
that
no
matter
how
we
decide
this
case,
tomorrow
congress
can
change
that
decision,
whichever
way
we
go?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ferenz,
the
question
is
to
what
is
?status
quo?
here;
the
ninth
circuit
has
to
set
the
status
quo.
unknown
speaker
how
far
is
it
geographically
from
guam
to
the
west
coast
of
united
states?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
west
coast
of
the
united
states
is
guam.
unknown
speaker
well
this
is
the
ninth
circuit.
i
was
talking
about
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
about
6000
miles.
how
many
lawyers
are
there
in
guam?
unknown
speaker
and
the
total
population
again,
a
hundred??.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
i
think
they
would.
unknown
speaker
well,
perhaps
no
one
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
(inaudible)
here
read
it
before
they
enacted
this
statute.
