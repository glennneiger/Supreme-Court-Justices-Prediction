mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
welcome
the
opportunity
to
carry
on
the
discussion
that
we
previously
had
with
mr.
trapp.
when
the
question
was
first
raised
here
i
was
equally
shocked
as
mr.
trapp
that
there
would
be
no
right
of
appeal
in
guam
where
this
court
to
affirm
and
strike
down
the
supreme
court
of
guam,
and
i
quite
agree
with
mr.
trapp?s
views
on
the
subject
matter
of
that
very
point.
to
answer
mr.
justice
marshall
i
would
say
this
that
the
article
vi
section
3
provision
of
the
constitution,
which
grants
plenary
power
to
the
congress
to
control
the
territory
of
guam,
is
the
authority
that
this
court
needs.
i
suggest
and
it
has
never
been
before
this
court
or
any
other
court
so
far
as
i
know,
if
congress
were
to
expressly
grant
to
guam
the
right
to
contain
its
own
appeals
that
that
might
be
construed
as
an
invalid
delegation
by
congress
of
its
plenary
powers.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
no,
i
suggest
that
is
an
argument
that
could
be
scholarly
made.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
the
only
thing
that
i
can
answer
that
is
that
those
provisions
may
have
been
invalid
under
that
argument.
to
develop
the
argument
let
us
review
the
elective
governor
bill
of
the
guam.
before
the
elective
governor
bill,
the
governor
of
guam
was
appointed
by
the
president,
and
at
that
time
the
laws
of
guam
were
subject
to
annulment
by
congress
after
one
year
or
within
one
year
period.
now,
since
the
elective
governor
bill
has
been
in
effect
congress
has
expressly
said,
?we
reserve
the
right
to
annul
any
law
of
guam.
in
effect,
they
have
given
guam
something
but
they
have
taken
it
back.
so
when
we
are
talking
about
self
determination
for
guam,
we
are
really
not
talking
about
self
determination
in
the
true
political
sense.
guam
is
an
unincorporated
--
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
that
is
correct.
the
statement
is
very
clear
and
very
precise.
now,
guam
was
set
up
in
a
traditional
sense
of
three
equal
branches
of
government
and,
if
we
are
to
say
that
the
guam
judiciary
is
without
the
control
of
congress,
that
is,
congress
says,
?you
may
create
your
own
judiciary
and
we
have
no
control
over
it?.
but
we
have
recognized
that
we
have
to
control
the
laws
of
guam
on
the
executive
branch,
then
i
say
that
we
do
not
have
an
equal
division
of
our
branches
of
government.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
that
by
virtue
of
the
elective
governor
provision
they
have
determined
that
self-determination
for
guam
is
still
a
limited
concept.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
exactly,
and
i
intended
to
conclude
my
remarks
by
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
most
reasonable
thing
to
do
is
to
leave
matter
status
quo
that
is
as
the
ninth
circuit
determined
it.
we
will
have
a
court
system
that
has
proven
itself
over
the
past.
the
ninth
circuit
has
played
an
important
part
in
the
laws
of
guam
and
its
progress.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
but
by
status
quo
i
mean
before
the
court
reorganization
act
--
what
i
am
saying
is
that
if
the
court
were
to
affirm,
we
would
have
a
orderly
process
for
litigants
to
take
appeals
in
the
important
cases
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
congress
will
have
an
opportunity
as
it
stated
before
in
the
con-con
act
or
in
some
other
later
time
to
seriously
consider
the
basis
for
guam?s
judiciary
and
self
determination.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
well
it
is
about
9000
miles,
from
the
west
coast,
6000.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
it
is
about
6000
miles,
it
is
about
14
hours.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
about
55
or
50
lawyers,
private
practice
plus
government
attorneys.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
100,000
roughly.
but
bear
in
mind
that
the
ninth
circuit
sits
every
year
in
hawaii,
and
they
have
sat
once
in
guam,
and
we
understand
the
indications
are
they
will
go
back.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
well,
i
think,
in
conclusion,
i
can
not
add
anymore,
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
taken
a
proper
step
in
reviewing
the
matter
and
should
take
it
to
congress.
i
have
said
in
the
amicus
brief
that
i
feel
that
the
language
that
has
been
used
in
unfortunate.
it
really
has
not
clarified
anything
for
us.
i
agree
with
justice
rehnquist
when
i
first
read
the
statute,
when
my
brother
at
the
bar
first
took
his
attack
at
it,
i
was
wondering
why
he
was
taking
on
it.
it
just
seemed
to
me
to
be
so
self
evident,
but
if
you
reread
it
and
consider
it
with
the
legislative
material
that
we
have
at
the
beginning
of
guam?s
organic
history;
then
it
becomes
clear
to
me
that
we
do
not
have
a
mandate
from
congress
that
guam
can
do
what
it
wants.
mr.
walter
s.
ferenz
i
think
that
is
entirely
possible.
thank
you.
