mr.
trapp,
help
me
out,
what
is
this
appellate
division
of
the
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
just
say,
physically
what
is
the
appellate
division?
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
judge,
three
judges
or
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
of
these
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
i
take
your
word
against
people
of
guam
who
spoke
through
their
legislator
including
you,
right?
how
can
i
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prevents
it,
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
one
word
that
i
could
find.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
do
you
get
that
from?
they
have
given
broad
authorization,
the
language
of
my
brother
rehnquist
is
also
broad.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
specifically
in
the
constitution
gives
us
authority
to
tell
guam
that
they
cannot
do
it?
i
thought
the
constitution
gave
congress
that
right,
i
do
not
think
it
gave
us
the
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
there
is
any
doubt,
who
should
it
be
in
favor
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
speak
for
the
people
of
guam?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
legal
argument
do
you
give
us
that
says
he
is
wrong,
other
than
your
argument
that
they
will
go
well
within
