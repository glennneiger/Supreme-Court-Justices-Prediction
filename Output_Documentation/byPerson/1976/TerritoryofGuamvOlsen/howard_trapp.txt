mr.
howard
trapp
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
a
question,
the
answer
to
which
being
given,
i
was
shocked
to
hear
it
because
i
believe
his
question
was,
well
what
if
the
ninth
circuit?s
decisions,
upheld
under
supreme
court
of
guam,
remain
stricken
down
at
the
present
time,
be
any
right
of
appeal
in
guam
at
all,
and
i
believe
the
general
troutman?s
answer
was,
no.
i
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
definitely
is
yes.
because
it
is
a
common
canon
of
statutory
construction
that
if
a
statute
is
amended
and
if
for
some
reason
--
and
it
is
obvious
that
the
intent
is
not
to
do
away
with
remedy
that
was
given,
for
example,
such
a
case
as
this,
there
was
no
intension
to
do
these
appeals
all
together,
but
rather
to
direct
appeals
through
a
different
route
and
to
a
different
court
is
that
repealer,
and
the
substitute
law
were
declared
invalid
and
of
course
the
original
law
would
spring
back
into
being.
and
under
section
55
of
the
guam
court
reorganization
act,
it
says,
every
reference
in
law,
rule,
or
regulation
to
the
island
court
shall
be
read
in
mean
to
superior
court
of
guam.
it
means
we
would
still
have
the
old
law
with
the
change
which
would
not
be
invalid
if
changing
the
old
island
court
named
the
superior
court,
and
then
the
law
under
the
ninth
circuit?s
latest
decision
would
simply
read
that
you
can
take
appeals
from
the
superior
court
of
guam
to
the
appellant
division
of
the
district
court
of
guam.
mr.
howard
trapp
well,
in
the
first
place,
i
think
we
have
at
least
raising
--
it
has
had
a
possible
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
--
well,
we
have
the
first
impression
whether
congress
intended
to
do
appeals
to
an
article
iii
court
eventually
on
federal
questions
and
--
mr.
howard
trapp
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
language
of
the
organic
act
which
prevents
that
but
i
think
we
are
not
--
the
government
seems
to
take
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
there
is
no
such
language
but
i
think
that
they
are
not
talking
about
the
real
world,
they
are
not
talking
about
the
world
that
the
congress
expect
it
would
obtain
in
guam
and
that
is
the
say
that
real
world
invariably
appeals,
and
a
certain
number
of
instances
are
always
allowed
by
legislature.
mr.
howard
trapp
of
course
and
the
language
in
the
organic
act
does
not
say,
shall
provide
appeals
in
all
cases.
so,
?determine?
mean
of
course
to
make
a
rationale
decision
of
some
sort
to
make
distinctions
between
cases
those
that
may
be
appealed
and
those
that
may
not
be
appealed.
mr.
howard
trapp
i
am
not
saying
that
the
language
does
not
say
that
there
cannot
be
no
appeals
at
all;
i
am
simply
saying
i
cannot
believe
that
congress
ever
anticipated
that
situation
ever
happening.
mr.
howard
trapp
as
to
the
congress
not
contemplating
never
doing
away
with
all
appeals?
mr.
howard
trapp
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
are
you
asking
me
why
couldn?t
they
simply
do
or
not
ever
provide
for
appeals?
mr.
howard
trapp
oh,
i
must
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
that
if
we
analyze
that
language
carefully
in
the
first
place,
we
look
at
the
first
sense
which
says,
in
what
courts
the
judicial
authority
shall
reside,
but
it
does
not
say
what
courts
can
be
created.
i
mean
you
look
at
the
second
sentence.
in
the
second
sentence
it
says
that
original
jurisdiction
can
be
transferred,
appellate
jurisdiction
can
be
determined.
now,
i
think
we
have
to
think
of
this
in
a
chronological
and
rationale
way.
there
is
no
appellate
jurisdiction
unless,
first
there
is
some
original
jurisdiction
which
has
been
transferred.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plain
language,
if
we
apply
the
plain
language
rule
to
this
second
sentence,
then
what
congress
is
saying
is,
well
look,
we
are
going
to
have
a
district
court
of
guam
and
that
district
court
of
guam
is
going
to
have
all
jurisdictions
and
of
course,
there
will
be
appeals
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
to
an
article
iii
court
from
that
district
court
of
guam.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
guam
legislature
wants
to
setup
its
own
courts
of
original
jurisdiction.
alright,
they
can
do
that.
they
can
take
that
jurisdiction
which
is
in
the
district
court
of
guam
and
they
can
transfer
it.
well,
what
about
appeals
them?
well,
in
that
event
then
an
appellate
jurisdiction
for
the
district
court
can
be
determined
and
appeals
can
then
go
from
these
new
courts
of
original
jurisdiction,
but
these
cases
will
nevertheless
go
up
through
the
district
court
which
is
a
creature
of
statute,
the
congress
rather.
mr.
howard
trapp
yes,
but
i
do
not
think,
i
cannot
believe
that
the
congress
ever
dreamt
the
guam
legislature
would
simply
say,
well
we
are
going
to
create
courts
of
original
jurisdiction
but
we
will
never
have
appeals
from
any
of
the
more
important
types
of
cases.
mr.
howard
trapp
well,
we
have
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
guam
now
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
to
suggest
that
that
was
ever
contemplated
by
the
congress
or
that
congress
ever
gave
any
expressive
authority
to
indicate
to
the
guam
legislature
that
it
simply
wants
a
let
go
of
the
guam
judicial
system.
mr.
howard
trapp
that
the
district
court
would
have
some
appellate
jurisdiction.
that
is
all
they
were
saying.
mr.
howard
trapp
yes,
and
that
is
all
they
were
saying.
mr.
howard
trapp
not
at
all.
mr.
howard
trapp
that
is
right.
mr.
howard
trapp
well
mr.
justice
marshall
what
the
appellate
division
is,
is
this,
originally
the
organic
act,
as
we
have
just
discussed,
set
in
the
trans-provincial
jurisdiction
that
the
legislature
could
determine
what
appellate
jurisdiction
the
district
court
of
guam
would
have.
now,
the
legislature
--
mr.
howard
trapp
alright,
the
legislature
--
mr.
howard
trapp
it
is
three
judges.
in
the
way
it
happens
to
come
about
to
be
three
judges
is
that
a
year
after
the
organic
act
was
enacted,
the
guam
legislature
decided
to
determine
appellate
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
and
in
doing
that
it
passed
public
law
17
which
setup
an
appellate
division
within
the
district
court,
and
it
provided
that
there
would
be
three
judges,
not
just
the
judge
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
as
the
judge
of
the
territorial
district
court
of
guam,
but
two
other
judges
originally
to
be
designated
to
set
temporary
status
by
the
chief
justice
of
united
states.
now,
this
was
on
the
books
for
some
years
when
the
congress
apparently
decided
to
recognize
what
the
guam
legislature
has
done
and
enacted
an
amendment
to
the
organic
act
which,
i
submit
to
this
court,
shows
that
the
congress
only
intended
for
the
district
court
of
guam
to
have
appellate
jurisdiction,
because
if
the
guam
legislature
have
the
power
to
simply
create
appellate
courts
then
you
could
say
well
by
creating
the
appellate
division
they
have
created
the
appellate
court.
but
the
congress
felt
it
was
necessary
to
go
a
step
further
and
legitimize
what
they
had
done
with
further
legislation.
even
though,
what
they
had
done
was
formalizing
the
procedure
within
the
framework
of
the
appellate
jurisdiction
which
congress
had
expressly
given
to
the
guam
legislature
that
is
to
say
the
jurisdiction
to
determine
what
appellate
jurisdiction
that
the
court
have.
mr.
howard
trapp
no,
they
are
now
--
they
might
be
judges
out
of
the
high
court
of
the
trust
territory
of
the
pacific
islands,
they
might
be
united
states
district
court
judges
from
an
actual
united
states
district.
mr.
howard
trapp
within
the
ninth
circuit
or
it
conceivably
--
mr.
howard
trapp
conceivably
even
outside,
i
believe.
mr.
howard
trapp
the
superior
court
probates
domestic
relations
matters.
when
you
say
traditional,
now
everything
local
has
been
transferred,
but
for
many
years
the
probate
jurisdiction
was
called
the
island
court
of
guam
which
is
really
no
more
than
the
predecessor
of
the
superior
court
which
is
the
island
court
with
an
enlarged
scope
of
jurisdiction.
i
might
say
that
this
is
a
very
unusual
thing
that
general
troutman
is
attributing
to
the
congress
to
say
that
in
effect
to
guam
legislature
can
make
the
very
highest
tribunal
in
guam,
the
highest
appellate
court
that
is
to
say,
for
example,
the
guam
supreme
court,
the
play
thing
of
the
legislature.
i
think
it
would
be
very
unusual
to
have
a
system
of
government
where
the
legislature
could
simply,
at
any
moment,
abolish
the
guam
supreme
court,
change
its
jurisdiction,
respectively
fire
the
judges
and
have
all
new
judges
appointed
for
whatever
political
reason
they
might
think
fit.
and
guam
does
have
a
record
of,
the
guam
legislature
does
have
a
record
and
i
am
presently
a
senator
of
that
legislature
but
i
was
not
a
part
of
this
scheme
about
just
a
few
years
ago
whereby
they
would
switch
the
appointing
power
back
and
forth
between
the
governor
and
the
legislature
depending
upon
who
is
in
power
and
how
it
suited
them.
so,
if
the
guam
supreme
court
is
to
be
upheld,
i
think
that
i
can
pretty
well
guarantee
to
this
court
that
it
will,
very
definitely,
be
the
play
thing
of
the
legislature.
the
constitutional
convention
act
definitely
has
a
great
deal
of
effect
upon
this
present
case,
because
the
language
is
different
by
far
then
we
find
in
the
present
organic
act.
it
is
the
first
time
we
find
expressed
authority
to
establish
a
?system
of
local
courts?.
i
do
not
think
that
we
are
reading
too
much
into
that
language
?system
of
local
courts?
to
think
of
higher
and
lower
courts.
this
is
the
first
time
we
find
that
expressed
language.
congress
did
not
use
it
before.
if
congress
wished
to
delegate
to
the
guam
legislature
in
1950
an
authority
to
establish
a
system
of
local
courts,
one
might
think
that
they
would
have
said
so.
they
have
said
so
for
the
first
time
in
the
constitutional
convention
act.
also
we
can
see
that
congress
agrees
that
this
matter
is
certainly
not
put
to
rest.
congress
has
not
yet
let
go
the
local
judiciary,
and
this
is
definitely
evidenced
by
the
constitutional
convention
act
where
congress
says
that
sometime
in
the
future
that
congress
is
still
going
to
regulate
the
federal
and
local
relationship.
mr.
howard
trapp
no,
it
has
not.
but
it
has
suggested
that
right
now
that
congress
has
already
regulated
that
federal
and
local
relationship
by
simply
saying
to
guam
--
and
this
is
the
petitioner?s
position
--
saying
to
guam,
?well,
go
ahead,
setup
whatever
system
you
want?,
but
congress
says
that
that
relationship
still
has
to
be
regulated.
now,
in
the
agana
bay
case
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
majority
said
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
guam
is
incapable
of
establishing
and
operating
its
own
appellate
court.
well,
i
take
exception
to
that
if
i
may,
and
i
think
it
is
a
consideration.
general
troutman
has
said
that
a
judge
or
a
justice
of
the
--
rather
a
judge
of
the
superior
court
must
be
a
lawyer.
well,
if
that
is
so
it
must
be
in
legislation
that
has
come
about,
i
believe,
since
the
court
reorganization
act.
i
am
not
sure
that
that
is
so
if
he
has
a
authority
to
that.
if
i
would
stand
correct
that
was
not
my
understanding.
but
in
any
event
if
a
lawyer
is
appointed
to
the
supreme
court
of
guam
that
lawyer
need
only
have
been
admitted
to
practice
six
months
before
his
appointment.
mr.
howard
trapp
that
might
be
so,
but
when
the
congress
originally
considered
setting
up
the
supreme
court
of
guam
and
keeping
in
mind
that
the
appointing
power
to
this
court
is
vested
in
the
president
of
united
states
as
oppose
to
--
mr.
howard
trapp
the
advise
and
consent
of
the
senate,
yes.
that
in
guam
what
we
are
talking
about
is
allowing
the
guam
legislature,
sometimes
they
do
it
themselves
allowing
the
governors,
sometimes
he
does
it
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
guam
legislature
depending
what
the
legislature
wants
to
do
at
that
time
to
in
effect
bring
about
a
situation
where
justices
will
be
appointed
who
really
have
very
low
or
no
qualifications.
mr.
howard
trapp
i
think
we
should
make
the
presumptions
that
it
is
capable
of
self-government,
but
on
the
other
hand
we
have
the
situation
where
i
would
agree
100%
with
the
underlying
notion
of
the
petitioner?s
case
that
guam
should
be
entitled
for
self
determination,
self
determination
of
the
legislature
that
the
people
of
the
guam
elect
their
own
representatives
to
make
their
laws.
self-determinations,
the
executives,
let
us
elect
our
own
executive
officer,
after
all
we
have
to
live
with
them
from
day
to
day
and
he
has
very
broad
powers.
but
when
we
get
to
judiciary
and
who
is
actually
considered
about
the
judiciary,
the
people
of
guam.
i
suggest
not
the
people
of
guam
really
generally,
but
litigants,
people
who
find
themselves
before
the
courts.
i
suggest
that
really
what
we
need
is
not
self
determination
necessarily,
what
we
need
is
learning,
what
we
need
is
experience,
and
what
we
need
is
impartiality.
i
can
tell
you
from
my
experience
in
practicing
in
guam
for
16-and-a-half
years
that
if
we
have
a
system
where
the
chief
justice
sits
on
these
cases
and
shares
his
offices
and
office
space
with
the
trial
judges,
where
two
of
the
trial
judges
along
with
the
chief
justice
will
sit
in
judgment
on
their
peers
as
the
way
it
has
worked
so,
far,
where
you
have
a
very
small
and
tight-knit
community
of
a
hundred
and
some
are
thousands
you
are
not
going
to
get
partiality.
mr.
howard
trapp
it
does
work
that
way
sometimes
but
only
when
they
are
unable
to
get
a
united
states
district
court
judge,
almost
invariably
they
get
a
judge
from
the
trust
territory,
and
they
get
a
united
state
district
court
judge
from
hawaii
or
the
mainland.
mr.
howard
trapp
yes
it
does.
mr.
howard
trapp
well,
yes
it
does,
but
the
guam
supreme
court,
if
you
lack
impartiality
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
district
court,
you
still
get
another
bite
of
the
apple
and
that
is
to
say
you
get
off
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
howard
trapp
as
to
the
representations
i
am
making
to
the
court,
no.
it
is
not
because
--
mr.
howard
trapp
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary,
because
i
think
what
i
am
really
saying
is
really
none
of
us
is
here
today
to
decided
whether
the
guam
is
ready
for
this
step,
the
ultimate
question
of
this
case.
because
no
evidence
is
taken
at
the
trial
court
level
on
this
point,
the
only
question
of
course,
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
howard
trapp
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
mr.
howard
trapp
mr.
justice
marshall
the
problem
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
authorizes
it
and
it
is
a
uniform
rule
that
the
territorial
legislature
cannot
do
what
is
not
authorized
by
the
congress
because
only
what
the
congress
--
mr.
howard
trapp
well,
i
suggest
you
that
you
simply
say
that
the
guam
legislature
can
determine
what
appellate
jurisdiction
that
district
court
will
have
is
not
broad
authorization
to
go
off
and
create
other
courts.
i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
the
suggestion
by
the
congress
that
that
would
be
the
limit
of
the
power
that
the
legislature
would
have
to
create
an
appellate
situation.
mr.
howard
trapp
well,
what
we
are
here
today
to
do
is
to
try
to
decide
whether
congress
has
done
that
or
not.
the
constitution
tells
congress
that
it
has
plenary
powers
over
the
territories.
it
has
complete
control
of
the
territories
and
because
of
that
a
number
of
courts
have
held
that
the
territories
have
only
such
powers
as
expressly
delegated
by
the
congress
to
the
territories.
mr.
howard
trapp
oh,
it
should
definitely
be
in
favor
of
the
congress,
the
congress
retaining
its
powers
because
the
delegation
has
to
be
an
expressed
one.
mr.
howard
trapp
today
before
this
court
i
suppose
that
the
attorney
general
is
speaking
for
the
people
of
guam
but
--
mr.
howard
trapp
well,
the
legal
argument
i
gave
you
mr.
justice
marshall
is
the
argument
that
i
made
when
i
have
first
bought
this
up
in
agana
bay
case
without
getting
involved
with
these
other
questions
that
we
are
involving
today.
i
simply
asked
the
district
court
to
read
that
statute
and
it
is
the
statute
itself
that
is
the
basis
of
our
argument,
and
i
care
for
reading
of
it,
i
submit
it
to
you
it
does
not
give
the
guam
legislature
the
authority
to
transfer
that
jurisdiction
or
to
create
other
appellate
courts.
mr.
howard
trapp
i
think
that
is
right.
thanks.
