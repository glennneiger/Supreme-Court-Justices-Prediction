unknown
speaker
the
government
prevailed
on
that,
the
court
of
appeal
did
not.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
raise
it
if
you
want
it
below.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
petition
--
i
do
not
understand
why
your
petition
raised
them
when
you
want
it
below.
you
were
really
--
what
you
lost
on
was
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act,
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
and
now
you
argue
with
a
new
statute
so
that
disappears
in
the
case
too?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how
much
--
it
is
your
case.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
of
the
meaning
of
lost,
you
lost
anyway,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well
the
obvious
ground
on
which
you
lost
was
the
administrative
procedure
act.
you
won
that
205(g)
was
not
a
jurisdictional
predicate.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
secretary
were
to
grant
a
hearing
in
connection
with
the
application
to
reopen,
would
that
make
his
denial
of
reopening
reviewable
under
205
(g)?
unknown
speaker
if
the
court
agrees,
that
section
205(h)
precludes
this
action
that
will
end
the
case.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
there
be
a
bivens
suite
on
the
situation
mr.
justice
white
just...
unknown
speaker
it
depended
on
1331
jurisdiction
did
not
it,
bivens?
unknown
speaker
and
the
statue
here
precludes
1331
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
we
have
to
have
something
like
that
in
mind
in
deciding
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
mr.
kowalski
that
that
has
been
made
possible
among
other
reasons
precisely
because
some
of
the
recipients,
some
of
the
beneficiaries
would
be
in
the
posture
of
your
client
and
not
advised
by
counsel
on
a
relatively
minor
claim
and
unsophisticated
enough
to
move
promptly.
i
suppose
that
is
why
that
safety
valve
is
left
there
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
that
section
did
not
give
you
access
to
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kowalski,
the
second
sentence
of
section
205(h)
or
405(h)
of
the
statute
which
you
have
just
quoted,
no
finding
a
fact
or
decision
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
by
any
person
tribunal
or
governmental
agency
except
as
herein
provided.
now,
you
say
it
is
possible
to
read
that
as
except
in
the
manner
herein
provided,
how
does
one
read
it
that
way?
i
mean,
just
as
a
matter
of
analysis
of
those
words.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
do
it?
tell
me.
unknown
speaker
you
just
substitute
the
words
'in
the
manner'
for
'as
herein
provided'.
unknown
speaker
you
construed
the
word
“as”
to
mean
in
the
matter.
unknown
speaker
well,
further
than
that,
how
could
you
make
this
clearer,
what
language
could
you
use,
use
in
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
the
congress
meant
that
the
federal
courts
should
not
have
any
jurisdiction.
how
could
they
have
said
it
clearer?
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
interpretation
in
the
nature
of
an
exhaustion
under
the
procedures
under
405(g).
and
then
go
into
the
district
court
is
that
what
you
are
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
quite
clear
that
the
405(g)
sets
up
a
procedure,
step
by
step
within
an
administrative
procedure
and
you
come
to
the
bottom
line
when
the
secretary
finally
makes
a
decision.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
all
of
that
really
is
acquired
and
as
you
go
through
that
preliminary
procedure,
get
secretary’s
final
determination
and
then
go
in
to
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
say,
attempts
to
review
final
decisions
on
the
merits
by
any
route
other
than
that
provided
in
405(g),
and
the
route
requires
you
to
go
through
several
steps
of
an
first
procedure.
unknown
speaker
but
once
you
have
done,
your
argument
is
that
405(g)
permits
you
then
to
go
on
to
district
court,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
i
understand
then,
you
agree
with
the
holding
below,
that
you
can
not
get
in
under
1331
or
any
other.
the
only
way
you
can
get
in
is
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
unknown
speaker
that
was
held
against
you.
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
accepting
that
for
the
purpose
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
the
government
is
trying
to
make
it
an
issue
--
unknown
speaker
but
as
you
said,
that
is
a
dissent,
that
is
a
dissent.
unknown
speaker
are
you
accepting
the
holing
blow
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
that
you
can
not
get
in
under
1331?
unknown
speaker
and
that
if
you
can
get
in,
you
can
only
get
in
under
the
administrative
procedure.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kowalski,
i
realized
here
that
structured
argument
maybe
kind
of
disorganized
but
that
is
kind
of
par
for
the
courts
here,
and
not
as
a
result
of
your
own
careful
preparation
but
as
a
result
of
the
question.
your
405(g)
point,
i
take
it
would
be
that
the
only
thing
the
district
court
would
have
power
to
review,
the
refusal
to
reopen
is
a
final
decision,
and
all
the
secretary,
all
the
district
court
has
power
to
review
as
far
that
the
secretary
complied
with
the
reopening
provisions.
you
do
not
claim
that
you
would
be
able
to
go
back
and
re-litigate
the
merits
as
if
you
would
petition
for
review,
the
first
time.
unknown
speaker
and
under
your
hypothesis
that
the
secretary
would
repeal
his
regulations
permitting
reopening
administratively,
then
there
would
be
nothing
you
could
do
on
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
amendment
contributed
anything
to
resolve
anything?
