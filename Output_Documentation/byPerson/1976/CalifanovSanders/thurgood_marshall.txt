anyway,
it
does
not
arise
under
the
statute...
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kowalski
i
did
not
know
about
the
cappadora
case
or
in
the
other.
did
the
party
get
the
relief
he
wanted,
or
did
it
in
cappadora
they
found
jurisdiction
and
then
said
that
you
lose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
others
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
first
hearing,
and
you
wait
four-and-a-half
years,
to
file
for
the
second,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
appears
that
there
was
no
hearing
that
never
had
been
one,
there
is
no
record,
there's
no
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is,
can
you
go
to
the
federal
court
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
secretary
says,
you
had
much
as
you
were
entitled
to,
which
was
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
come
in
federal
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
come
in
to
the
federal
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it,
it
is
never.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
in
this
case
the
record
was
never
produced.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
was
it
before
the
secretary?
did
he
look
at
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
a
form
of
a
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
think
so.
