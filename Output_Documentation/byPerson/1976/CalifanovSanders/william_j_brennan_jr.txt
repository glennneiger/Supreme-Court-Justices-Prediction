that
would
be
true
mr.
rosenberg.
the
case,
for
example,
where
taking
a
way
of
hypothetical.
the
denial
of
reopening
was
squarely
stated
to
be
on
the
ground,
the
applicant
being
black,
that
you
are
a
black
and
that
is
why
we
reopen.
justice

and
review
in
the
federal
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
there
be
jurisdiction
under
your
submission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
statutory
predicate,
the
jurisdiction
would
be
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
carve
such
an
exception
in
that
kind
of
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
it
be
stretched
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you
could
not
stretch
to
cover,
what
would
the
applicant
do?
where
could
he
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
they
could
go
to
a
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
is
on
his
federal
constitutional
client.
you
could
not
in
the
federal
court,
perhaps
unless
you
can
stretch
205(g)
and
let
him
go.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
could
you
sue
the
officer
for
constitutional
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
he
has
been
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law
by
an
officer
of
the
united
states
government,
supposing
you
have
a
direct
action
on
to
the
constitution.
justice
william

in
the
califano
case,
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
neither
--
that
although
section
205
(g)
of
the
social
security
act
did
not
authorize
judicial
review
of
a
decision
of
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
not
to
reopen
a
previously
adjudicated
claim
for
social
security
benefits,
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedures
act
is
an
independent
draft
to
district
court's
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
review
that
decision.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
section
205
(g)
of
the
social
security
act
does
not
authorize
judicial
review
of
the
decision,
but
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
authorize
that
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
should
announce
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment,
an
opinion
in
which
chief
justice
burger
has
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
of
decision
of
the
case.
