mr.
maurice
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
refusal
by
the
secretary
of
hew
to
reopen
a
disability
claim.
the
disability
claim
was
presented
and
decided
some
seven
years
before,
and
the
secretary,
at
that
time,
made
a
decision
denying
the
claim.
the
history
of
the
case
falls
into
two
chapters:
the
first
chapter
was
in
the
period
january,
1964
to
june,
1966.
in
that
period,
the
respondent
made
a
claim
to
the
social
security
administration
for
disability
benefits,
it
received
initial
consideration
and
was
rejected;
it
received
reconsideration
and
was
rejected.
he
asked
for
a
hearing,
he
received
a
hearing,
evidence
was
submitted,
the
examiner
made
a
lengthy
decision
and
in
the
lengthy
decision
which
he
rendered,
the
hearing
examiner
now
an
administrative
law
judge,
by
title,
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
the
respondent
had
not
qualified
for
insured
status
up
to
the
point
when
he
had
submitted
his
claim.
his
insured
status
had
come
to
an
end
in
june
of
1962.
he
had
not
submitted
his
claim
until
1964
and
he
was
not
in
insured
status
at
the
time
he
contended
when
disability
struck.
the
hearing
examiner
further
found
that
he
was
not
disabled
at
all
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
at
the
time
when
he
was
within
insured
status.
the
respondent
then
appealed
to
the
appeals
council
in
the
administration.
the
appeals
council
affirmed
the
administrative
law
judge,
told
in
its
affirmance,
told
the
respondent
that
he
had
60
days
within
which
to
take
an
action
in
the
court
if
he
were
so
minded.
he
chose
not
to.
instead,
after
seven
years
he
brought
the
second
round
of
proceedings
before
the
social
security
administration.
these
embrace
the
period
march
1973
to
mid
1974.
in
that
period,
he
once
again
had
initial
consideration
of
the
claim
which
he
made.
he
received
reconsideration
of
that
client.
he
then
asked
for
a
hearing
before
an
administrative
law
judge,
the
alj
decided
that
he
had
not
presented
anything
warranting
a
reopening
of
his
claim,
which
was
based
upon
the
same
disability
benefits
period
as
the
earlier
round
had
been.
that
is
to
say,
the
respondent
showed
no
entitlement
subsequent
to
june
30,
1962.
accordingly,
on
the
basis
of
res
judicata
the
respondent
having
shown
nothing
new
in
the
second
round
proceeding,
the
administrative
law
judge
rejected
his
claim.
the
respondent
then
appealed
to
the
appeals
council,
and
the
appeals
council
affirmed
the
rejection
on
the
second
round.
this
is
the
reopening
round.
following
that
rejection,
the
respondent
moved
in
to
the
federal
courts,
now
for
the
first
time
advised
by
council.
in
the
federal
courts,
he
claimed
that
under
section
205(g)
of
the
social
security
act,
he
was
entitled
to
get
the
court
review
of
the
refusal
of
the
administrative
proceedings
of
the
secretary
to
reopen
his
claim.
the
district
judge
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana
dismissed
his
claim
on
the
ground
that
section
205(g)
of
the
social
security
act
is
not
a
proper
jurisdictional
footing
for
a
request
to
review
a
claim
to
reopen.
he
appealed,
the
seventh
circuit
dividing
decided
that
although
it
was
correct
that
section
205(g)
and
the
social
security
act
are
not
a
proper
jurisdictional
footing
for
reviewing
in
the
federal
courts
a
denied
reopening
claim
nevertheless
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
it
was
in
that
posture
of
the
case
that
this
court
granted
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari.
there
are
several
points
to
notice
about
this
brief
historical
narrative.
one
is
that
although
without
counsel
throughout
the
administrative
proceedings,
the
respondent
exercised
a
number
of
options
pursuing
vigorously
as
he
was
entitled
to
do
and
should
have
done,
the
opportunities
which
the
law
afforded
him
to
get
consideration,
reconsideration,
and
review
again
and
again.
he
came
back
to
the
administrative
process
after
a
lapse
of
more
than
seven
years.
the
administrative
process
has
rules
about
such
matters.
it
allows
a
rejected
claimant
to
come
back
within
a
year
on
virtually
no
new
showing,
and
ask
for
reopening.
within
four
years,
after
the
final
decision
denying
his
claim,
he
can
come
back,
and
if
he
shows
good
cause,
he
can
get
a
reopening.
good
cause
usually
goes
to
the
evidence,
new
material
evidence.
after
four
years,
he
may
still
go
back,
at
any
time,
the
regulations
say,
but
in
that
event,
he
is
limited
in
his
return
to
the
administrative
process
for
reopening.
he
is
limited
to
showing
that
there
was
error
of
a
clerical
sort
or
an
error
on
the
face
of
the
evidence.
it
was
the
latter,
sort
of,
evidence
which
the
respondent
in
this
case
set
up
as
the
error
involved,
but
the
record
does
not
say
and
we
do
not
know
to
this
date
what
the
nature
of
that
error
in
the
evidence
is.
the
government’s
case
here
is
simple,
in
two
points.
it
is
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
bestowed
on
the
federal
courts
by
the
social
security
act
to
review
a
reopening
denial
and
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
your
honor,
it
is
raised
very
strenuously
by
a
respondent
who
argues
that
here,
and
we
believe
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
yes.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
no,
your
honor
there
is
an
explanation,
intervening
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
we
lost
below.
we
have
managed
to
lose
on
whatever
ground.
the
explanation
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
yes
your
honor.
we
won
below
on
that
and
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
agreed
on
that.
however,
my
colleague
says
that
this
court
and
its
decisions
in
weinberger
v.
salfi
and
mathews
v.
eldridge
worked
to
change
in
the
necessary
interpretation
of
205
(g),
and
it
is
to
forestall,
or
if
i
may
use
the
term,
abort
any
wrong
turn
by
the
court
in
that
direction
that
i
raised
the
point
now
of
205
(g).
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
he
did
not
raise
it
by
cross
petition
mr.
chief
justice,
but
he
does
set
forth
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance
one
of
which
is
the
liberalization
of
section
205
(g)
by
the
interpretations
of
this
court
intervene.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
yes
i
concede
to
your
honor
that
the
respondent
can
raise
a
new
point
of
such
beyond
(ph)
appeal
to
defend
his
result.
first
is
to
the
social
security
act
and
specifically
section
205
of
the
act.
our
submission
is
that
it
precludes
jurisdiction
to
review
a
denial
of
reopening
of
a
disability
claim.
the
decision
not
to
reopen
does
not
come
within
the
carefully
drawn
language
of
section
205
(h)
of
the
statute,
and,
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
specific
language
of
section
205
(h)
since
so
much
trends
(ph)
upon
it,
in
this
first
argument.
on
page
2a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
section
205
(a)
appears
in
its
three
sentences.
it
is
to
the
second
and
third
sentence,
i
call
your
attention.
the
second
sentence
says,
“no
findings
of
fact
or
decision
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
by
any
person,
tribunal,
or
government
agency
except
as
herein
provided.”
the
third
sentence
says
that,
“no
action
against
the
united
states,
the
secretary,
or
any
officer
or
employee
thereon
shall
be
brought
under
section
41
of
title
28
to
recover
on
any
claim
arising
under
this
subchapter
title
ii
of
the
act.”
section
205
(h)
is
a
statute
that
precludes
jurisdiction.
it
talks
in
terms
of
non-reviewability
of
findings
and
decisions.
it
talks
in
terms
of
no
actions
being
brought.
so,
it
is
preclusive
with
the
narrow
exception
that
is
specified.
that
is,
the
herein
provided
the
exception,
and
that
herein
provided
exception
takes
us
a
page
ahead
to
section
205
(g)
which
this
court
has
said,
is
the
only
way
of
reviewing
a
decision
of
the
administrator
under
the
social
security
act.
section
205
(g)
in
its
relevant
phrase
says
that,
“any
individual
after
any
final
decision
of
the
secretary
made
after
a
hearing,
may
go
into
court
to
bring
an
action
in
the
district
court.
the
rest
of
this
section
deals
with
the
venue
of
the
action,
the
time
of
the
action
within
60
days
after
a
notice
of
the
decision,
the
record
which
will
be
before
the
district
court,
the
court's
powers
to
remedy
hereby
the
administrator,
the
scope
and
standards
of
review
that
the
court
will
follow.
that
is
an
integrated
plan
for
a
court
review
of
social
security
administrative
decisions
and
it
is
precisely
to
that
plan
and
that
channel
of
court
review
that
section
205,
by
its
preclusive
language,
points
the
court
in
this
case.
this
court
had
said
that
when
the
administrator
has
made
a
decision,
as
said
in
weinberger
v.
salfi,
whether
a
final
decision
or
not
a
decision,
when
the
administrator
or
secretary
has
made
a
decision,
then
205
(g)
gives
the
only
avenue
for
access
into
the
court.
if
the
court
please,
i
do
not
find
in
the
salfi
decision
or
in
the
eldridge
decision
any
indication
that
those
decisions
were
calculated
to
change
that
carefully
wrote
(ph)
statutory
plan,
which
is
very
well
balanced
and
which
brings
about
a
harmonious
relationship
so
far
as
the
law
should
require
between
the
court’s
power
to
review
and
the
administrator’s
power
to
decide
in
the
first
instance.
there
is
nothing
certainly
in
the
language
of
section
205
(g)
to
suggest
that
a
decision
such
as
is
before
the
court
in
this
case,
a
decision
not
to
reopen,
is
a
final
decision
made
after
a
hearing.
of
course,
it
is
made
after
a
hearing
in
some
chronological
and
temporal
sense.
but,
it
is
made
after
a
hearing
in
the
sense
that,
that
phrase
occurs
in
section
205
(g).
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
your
honor
i
believe
not.
i
believe
that
it
would
not
be
a
final
decision
after
a
hearing,
in
the
sense
in
which
a
final
decision
is
used
in
that
statute.
it
is
my
submission
that
the
final
decision
after
a
hearing
is
intended
to
deal
with
the
determination
of
the
core
and
hard
issues
in
the
case,
that
is,
a
final
decision
made
after
a
hearing
on
the
merits
when
the
merits
of
the
case
have
been
exposed
and
a
decision
finally
made
upon
them.
there
isn’t
any
liberalization
of
that
language,
if
that
is
the
term,
in
salfi
and
eldridge.
they
did
not
rewrite
section
205
(g)
which
would
be
necessary
to
do.
those
cases
dealt
with
extraordinary
circumstances
and
issues,
the
issues
had
to
deal
with
the
constitutionality
of
standards
or
procedures
under
the
social
security
act.
this
is
an
ordinary
case,
the
application
of
standards
by
the
administrator
to
facts.
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
case
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
suggest,
i
submit,
that
the
respondent
can
carry
an
open-end
statute
of
limitations,
moved
for
a
rehearing
or
reopening,
and
upon
getting
it,
whether
with
or
without
a
hearing,
have
a
brand
new
period
of
time
in
which
to
go
to
court.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
on
this,
justice
rehnquist,
my
contention
is
substantially
as
you
say,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
language,
a
final
decision
made
after
a
hearing,
does
refer
to
a
hearing
that
is
required
by
the
statutes.
the
hearing
on
reopening
is
not
a
hearing
that
is
required
by
the
statute.
that
is
the
hearing
and
that
is
the
matter
of
grace
(ph)
with
the
administrator.
if
the
administrator
or
if
the
secretary
chooses
to
give
a
hearing
at
that
time
that
should
not
prolong
the
opportunity
of
the
respondent
to
go
in
to
court.
otherwise,
the
whole
idea
of
a
60-day
limitation
on
entering
into
court
is
defeated.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
at
the
point
of
concluding
the
government’s
submission
with
regard
to
the
jurisdiction
and
review
provisions
of
section
205
of
a
social
security
act.
the
statute
is
cast
in
words
and
clothed
with
purpose
to
show
the
jurisdiction
for
court
review
of
the
secretary’s
actions
refusing
reopening
are
precluded,
unless
they
are
permitted.
section
205(g)
does
not
grant
jurisdiction,
but
section
205(h)
does
positively
bar
jurisdiction
by
reason
of
both
its
second
and
its
third
sentences.
the
second
sentence
alone
carries
the
argument.
it
says
no
finding
of
fact
or
decisions
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
by
any
tribunal
except
as
205(g)
provides
and
as
we
have
seen
205(g)
makes
no
provision
for
review
here.
that
preclusion
leaves
no
room
for
any
other
exceptions,
the
government
urges,
whether
the
exception
is
related
to
the
administrator
procedure
act
or
mandamus
or
any
other
outside
source
of
purported
jurisdiction.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
your
honor,
if
the
question
involved
the
intrusion
of
a
non-constitutional
standard
by
the
administrator,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
attack
would
be
upon
that
un-constitutional
standard.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
i
believe
that
review
would
be
sought
in
the
federal
court,
whether
it
would
be
granted
or
not.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
in
my
submission,
there
would
not
be
jurisdiction
unless
it
could
be
found
under
section
205(g)
as
it
was
in
weinberger
v.
salfi,
and
in
mathews
v.
eldridge,
by
viewing
the
constitutional
attack
upon
the
action
of
the
administrator
as
so
fundamentally
at
odds
with
constitutional
doctrine
that
an
implied
exception
would
be
carved
almost
stretched
out
of
205(g),
but
other...
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
it
would
have
to
be
section
205(g)
of
the
statute,
if
there
were...
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
your
honor,
the
case
is
a
very
difficult
one
for
me.
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
since
the
federal
district
courts
sit
to
hear
such
cases
as
congress
and
its
wisdom,
arrogates
to
them
jurisdictionally
that
in
the
absence
of
any
jurisdiction
investiture,
and
i
find
none
in
that
sort
of
case
unless
section
205(g)
were
stretched
to
cover
it.
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
well
i
have
not,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
have
not
tried
to
decide
that
case
in
my
own
mind.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
well,
i
believe
that
he
would
be
in
the
same
situation
that
those
applicants
were
veterans’
benefits,
find
themselves
in,
when
they
are
not
able
to
get
reveal
of
actions
by
the
veterans’
administration
in
connection
with
benefits
sought
under
that
system.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
i
assume,
your
honor,
that
if
a
state
court
allowed
jurisdiction
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
he...
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
that,
your
honor
is
where
i
come
out
on
that
difficult
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
your
honor,
the
question
is
under
what
statute
do
i
take
it,
mr.
justice
brennan
is
pressing
me
and...
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
i
believe
that
under
the
amendment
tl94-754
which
congress
enacted
on
october
21st,
1976
that
allows
for
review
of
any
agency
action
without
regard
to
jurisdictional
amount,
we
may
now
have
a
basis
under
that
statute
for
review
of
such
question
as
mr.
justice
brennan’s
hypothetical
poses.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
your
honor,
bivens
is
going
through
my
mind
but
it
is
not
finding
much
purchase.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
i
do
believe
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
it
does
--
here
with
respect
to
actions
brought
on
claims
under
the
social
security
act,
i
am
not
sure
that
in
the
case,
suppose
the
contention
would
be
that
there
was
a
claim
brought
under
the
statute.
it
might
be
that
--
so
i
believe
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
that
may
be
our
solution
that
there
is
not
a
claim
brought
under
the
statute,
that
it
is
therefore
not
precluded
by
section
1331
under
the
third
sentence
of
205(h).
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
we
do
not
have
any
such
question
here,
your
honor.
if
the
court
agrees
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
i
dare
say,
your
honor.
if
the
court
agrees
that
section
205(h)
is
absolutely
preclusive
of
this
action,
that
will
end
the
case.
it
will
not
need
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
section
10
of
the
apa
creates
jurisdiction
above
and
beyond
the
careful
and
complete
scheme,
which
is
embodied
in
section
205
of
the
social
security
act.
that
results
from
the
language
of
the
apa
as
well
as
from
the
preclusive
affect
of
section
205
itself.
the
apa
is
in
terms,
not
applicable
to
the
extent
that
a
statue
precludes
court
review
of
agency
action.
similarly,
it
is
in
its
own
terms,
not
applicable
because
the
decision
to
reopen
or
not
is
committed
to
the
agency’s
discretion
and
under
section
701(a)
of
the
apa,
that
is
the
matter
to
which
the
apa
is
not
applicable.
beyond
that,
and
even
if
we
cross
the
threshold
into
the
land
of
the
administrator
procedure
act,
there
is
no
bestowal
of
jurisdiction
in
that
statute.
the
administrative
procedure
act
not
an
understandably
regulates
procedures,
it
regulates
the
forms
and
standards
for
judicial
review.
it
prescribes
what
judges
may
do
with
cases
properly
before
them,
but
it
does
not
act
as
a
vehicle
to
bring
cases
into
the
courts
before
the
judges.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
cappadora
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
the
only
thing
precluded
by
subsection
(h)
was
what
was
permitted
by
(g).
that
turns
the
statute
on
its
head.
the
package
of
(g)
and
(h)
are
a
preclusive
package,
an
effort
to
canalize
review
of
the
administrators
on
the
secretary’s
action.
and
to
say
that
everything
is
permitted
to
go
into
court
that
is
not
absolutely
precluded
is
simply
to
turn
that
upside
down
and
to
reach
some
rather
curious
results.
for
example,
that
the
only
decision
of
the
secretaries
that
must
be
brought
into
court
within
60
days
and
according
to
prescribed
procedures
as
mr.
justice
brennan
was
mentioning,
are
those
that
reach
the
merits
of
the
claim
and
decided
after
a
hearing
as
a
final
decision.
but
every
other
interlocutory,
premature,
post
mature
or
whatever
sort
of
administrative
decision
that
can
be
made
then
has
open
and
time
jurisdiction,
no
rules
at
all
about
the
procedures
of
the
scheme
of
review.
congress
could
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
would
not
have
reached
the
point
where
a
60
day
limitation
builds
in...
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
in
the
absence
of
a
final
decision
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
it
does
appear
to
me,
your
honor
that
if
there
has
been
a
refusal
to
grant
a
hearing,
that
the
court
would
end
a
dismissal
in
effect
on
the
law
that
the
decision
made
at
that
stage
of
the
game,
would
be
deemed
to
be
one
made
after
a
waiver
by
the
secretary
of
an
acquirement
of
the
hearing,
as
it
was
done.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
will
get
us
pretty
close
to
the
salfi
and
eldridge
situations.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
your
honor
puts
the
case
in
which
something
approaching
the
constitutional
fundamental
defects
of
those
--
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
the
record
was
in
a
particular
form
handed
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
the
record
was
before
the
secretary
and
the
administrators,
the
question
was
whether
the
court
had
the
record
before
it,
and
there
is
in
the
papers
an
indication
that
a
form
of
the
record
was
produced
on
the
appeal
in
this
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
your
honor,
the
terminology
is
a
bit
abstruse
for
me
and
i
searched
for
the
exact
form
of
(inaudible)
in
the
record
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
locate
it.
mr.
maurice
rosenberg
it
is
in
the
record.
it
is
also
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
just
wanted
to
make
two
other
points.
first,
with
respect
to
whether
sa100
effects
any
change,
i
believe
the
important
point
to
notice
here
is
that
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
for
congress
to
enact
it
last
october,
an
amendment
to
section
1331,
if
the
apa
already
conferred
that
broad
jurisdiction
that
is
contended
for
here.
the
very
fact
that
congress
saw
fit
to
remove
the
amount
in
controversy
limitation
on
federal
jurisdiction
as
applied
to
agency
action,
and
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
is
the
clearest
evidence,
that
congress
thought
the
apa
did
not
confer
jurisdiction.
