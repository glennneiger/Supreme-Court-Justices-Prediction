mr.
william
a.
kowalski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
request
leave
to
file
reply
or
a
response
to
a
reply
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
secretary,
and
which
was
served
upon
me
since
arriving
in
washington,
two
days
ago.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
would
like
to
say
through
that
in
this
case,
let
it
be
clear
that,
i
do
not
represent
any
cause
or
any
class
other
that
the
initial
original
plaintiff,
mr.
sanders.
and
by
the
way,
his
first
name
is
mr.
so
that
his
correct
designation
is
mr.
mr.
sanders.
i
am
not
here
for
academic
exercise
and
as
i
said,
i
am
not
looking
to
establish
any
legal
precedent
for
any
reason.
i
am
here
only
to
represent
the
claim
of
mr.
sanders.
mr.
sanders,
not
because
any
constitutional
claim
is
raised
mr.
justice
brennan,
happens
to
be
a
black
man,
he
is
an
illiterate
black
man.
the
nature
of
his
claim
is
that
he
filed
a
disability
claim,
alleging
that
he
was
disabled
and
that
he
failed
however
to
prosecute
timely
his
appellate
rights
to
the
district
court.
several
years
elapsed,
four-and-a-half
i
believe,
when
he
again
went
to
the
social
security
because
he
was
still
unable
to
work
and
his
family
physician
confirmed
his
disability,
he
again
filed
an
application.
he
was
summarily
denied
and
it
was
at
this
point
that
he
retained
counsel,
that
counsel
being
myself.
after
the
final
decision
of
the
appeals,
counsel
was
rendered,
district
court
action
was
filed
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana,
and
the
cause
was
summarily
dismissed
for
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
this
court
knows
that
the
divided
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
would
like
because
it
is
central
to
the
respondents
arguments,
direct
the
courts
attention
in
addition
to
this
statutes
already
cited.
the
social
security
regulation
which
is
found
on
page
15
on
respondents
brief,
and
is
known
codified
as
20cfr404.957,
which
in
pertinent
part
states
that
an
initial
revised
or
reconsidered
determination
of
the
administration,
or
a
decision
or
revised
decision
of
a
hearing
examiner
or
of
the
appeals
counsel
which
is
otherwise
final,
maybe
reopened,
see
at
anytime,
when
such
determination
or
decision
is
unfavorable
to
the
party
thereto
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
error
on
the
face
of
the
evidence
on
which
such
determination
or
decision
was
based.
continuing,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
definition
of
error
on
the
face
of
the
evidence
or
as
some
courts
have
referred
to
it
as
manifest
error
on
the
face.
the
definition
is
also
found
at
page
15
of
the
respondents
brief,
and
it
is
to
be
found
also
in
the
social
security
claims
manual,
section
7015
and
it
reads
as
follows:
an
error
on
the
face
of
evidence
exists,
where
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
file
on
the
which
determination
or
decision
was
based,
and
any
evidence
or
record
anywhere
in
the
administration
at
a
time
such
determination
or
decision
was
made,
it
is
clear
that
the
determination
or
decision
was
incorrect.
now,
i
point
that
out
to
the
court
because
the
complaint
that
was
filed
by
mr.
sanders
alleged
error
on
the
face
of
the
evidence.
he
was
obviously
late
in
filing
his
claim,
more
than
60
days,
in
fact,
over
four
years
had
elapsed
from
the
time
of
the
initial
determination.
if
we
strip
this
case
to
the
bone,
what
we
have
is
this.
mr.
sanders,
who
had
contributed
to
the
social
security
fund
at
one
time
became
in
the
course
of
his
life,
disabled.
he
filed
a
claim
for
benefits,
it
was
summarily
denied.
he
did
not
timely
prosecute
his
appeal
but
he
was
later
advised
that
the
social
security
administration
affords
him
relief
to
have
his
case
reopened
at
anytime,
if
there
is
manifest
error
on
the
face
of
that
evidence.
the
question
then
becomes
--
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
would
presume,
your
honor,
any
basis
which
would
result
in
fairness
on
the
claimant.
the
social
security
claim
is
not
an
adversary
proceeding,
and
i
would
agree
with
your
honor,
that
that
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
many
purposes
of
that
section.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
in
and
of
itself,
that
is
correct.
there
are
four
aspects
of
the
argument
which
i
would
like
to
point
out
before
i
get
to
it.
one
is
as
counsel
has
stated,
whether
or
not
section
405(h)
that
is
the
u.s
code
section
405(h)
is
a
preclusion
of
any
manner
of
review,
except
as
that
specified
in
section
405(g)
of
the
act.
the
second
question
is,
can
section
405(g)
of
the
act
serve
as
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
to
review
reopening
petitions.
the
third
question
is
whether
the
administrative
procedure
act
can
be
regarded
as
the
basis
of
jurisdiction
in
reopening
petitions.
the
fourth
item
of
the
argument
refers
to
whether
or
not
the
entertainment
of
jurisdiction,
in
this
type
of
case
would
result
in
a
flood
of
re-litigation
of
stale
claims.
and
this
point
is
made
because
the
secretary
makes
much
of
it
in
his
brief
and
in
the
court
below
and
we
will
explain
in
the
course
of
the
argument
that
this
has
not
occurred
and
that
it
will
not
occur.
the
first
question
then
is
whether
or
not
section
405(h)
of
the
act
is
a
total
preclusion
of
any
review
other
than
that
specified
in
section
405(g)
of
the
act.
i
would
like
to
admit
at
the
very
outset
that
all
of
the
three
questions
that
are
raised
are
extremely
close
questions
and
that
very
candidly,
they
can
with
reason
be
interpreted
either
way.
i
refer
to
a
comment
that
mr.
justice
brennan
made
in
his
decent
in
salfi
that
is
the
case
of
weinberger
v.
salfi
decided
by
this
court
last
year,
where
he
says
discussing
that
the
very
problem
of
the
interpretation
of
405(h),
the
justice
says,
the
question
involves
complicated
questions
of
legislative
intent
and
statutory
provisions
42
usc
section
405(h)
which
has
baffled
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
for
years
in
this
and
other
contexts.
so
let
it
be
known
that
it
is
a
difficult
question.
the
problem
of
this
court
then
is
what
is
the
more
reasonable
construction
of
that
statute?
should
it
be
construed
as
a
total
preclusion
or
should
there
be
an
avenue
of
escape?
for
example,
justice
brennan
just
raised
by
his
question,
the
hypothetical
of
one
being
denied
any
benefits
because
he
was
say,
a
black
man.
would
section
405(h)
be
a
total
preclusion?
the
leading
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
which
i
think,
started
this
matter
of
petitions
to
reopen,
is
the
frequently
cited
case
of
cappadora
v.
celebrezze,
out
of
the
second
circuit
which
is
cited
at
--
i
am
reading
from
page
7
of
the
respondent's
brief,
where
the
court
recognized
this
problem
in
that
case
and
also
admitted
that
the
statute
could
be
construed
in
more
than
one
manner.
reading
from
the
opinion
of
the
court,
it
is
stated
although
it
could
be
argued
that
the
second
sentence
of
section
405(h)
of
the
social
security
act
is
a
statutory
preclusion
of
such
review,
the
more
reasonable
construction
is
that
this
simply
forbids
attempts
to
review
final
decisions
on
the
merits,
by
any
route
other
than
provided
in
section
405(g).
as
we
will
point
out
later
that
served
as
the
leading
case
for
many
others
circuits
which
are
followed
in
line.
but
to
point
to
the
very
language
of
the
second
sentence
of
405(h),
where
it
says,
"no
findings
of
fact
or
decisions
of
the
secretary
shall
be
reviewed
by
any
person
tribunal
or
governmental
agency
except
as
provided
herein
that
as
provided
herein
can
mean
in
the
manner
provided
herein.
as
opposed
to
stating
that
only
this
type
of
situation
is
amendable
to
judicial
review,
and
i
believe
that
is
the
way
the
court
in
cappadora
v.
celebrezze
interpreted
it.
as
i
stated
many
circuits
followed
the
lead
of
cappadora,
there
was
only
one
that
did
not.
that
was
the
case
of
stuckey
v.
weinberger
which
is
also
cited
at
page
7
of
respondent's
brief,
but
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
that
alone
maverick
decision,
five
of
the
justices
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
they
stated
as
follows,
and
i
am
reading
from
page
7
on
respondents
brief,
the
second
sentence
of
42
usc
section
405(h)
should
not
be
construed
to
preclude
judicial
review.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
well
by
the
very
plain
meaning.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
well
i
could,
--
in
all
due
deference,
your
honor,
i
could
read
it
that
way
where
it
says,
except
as
herein
provided
to
me
could
reasonably
be
meant,
except
in
the
manner
herein
provided.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor
is
that
--
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
it
can
reasonably
be
construed.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
well
it
depends
on
what
the
true
meaning
of
the
congress
was.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
have
asked
myself
that
question,
i
think
the
whole
405(h)
could
have
been
reworded
something
to
the
effect
that
there
shall
be
no
judicial
review
of
final
decision
on
the
merits,
under
this
statute
or
any
other
statute,
except
by
following
the
procedure
setout
in
405(g),
i
believe
that
would
do
it.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
am
not
certain
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
correct.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
believe
that
is
correct,
what
--
the
court
in
cappadora
and
the
many
cases
that
followed,
it
stated
that
in
their
–
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
that
is
correct
and
cappadora...
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
that
is
not
what
cappadora
said,
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
said
the
opposite.
i
will
get
to
that
later
in
the
argument.
cappadora,
as
well
as
the
court
below
in
the
seventh
circuit,
as
counsel
brought
out
to
the
court
stated
that
405(g)
was
not
the
jurisdictional
route
to
go
on
these
cases,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
invoked
as
the
correct
jurisdictional
base.
at
any
rate,
cappadora
and
the
cases
following
it,
held
that
405(h)
was
not
a
total
preclusion
and
jurisdiction
was
allowed
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
many
cases
that
followed
cappadora
set
forth
at
page
6
of
respondent's
brief
and
by
circuits,
they
constitute
the
first,
second,
third,
fifth,
sixth
and
seventh
circuits,
which
have
followed
cappadora.
as
i
will
discuss
later,
the
fourth
and
the
eighth
circuits
entertain
petitions
to
reopen
but
on
a
different
jurisdictional
basis.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
personally,
your
honor,
believe
you
can
get
in
under
1331.
but
that
is
not
the
holding
of
this
court.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
this
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
well
it
is
not
really
an
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor,
and
since
weinberger
v.
salfi
--
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
well,
i
would
agree
with,
your
honor,
in
the
decent,
may
not
help
my
cause
before
this
court,
it
was
observed
in
the
decent
in
which
you
wrote
in
weinberger
v.
salfi
in
which
justice
marshall
concurred
that
section
1331
can
serve
as
the
jurisdictional
basis
because
a
petition
to
reopen
is
not
a
claim
for
money.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
that
is
correct
but
you
asked
me
personally.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
prepared
to
abide
by
this
courts
holding
in
weinberger
v.
salfi.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
as
i
developed
further,
your
honor
and
the
reason
we
are
making
a
point
that
under
this
court’s
recent
decisions
in
weinberger
v.
salfi
and
eldridge
v.
mathews
that
section
205
and
405,
rather
of
the
code
can
be
stretched,
and
it
has
been
stretched
in
all
due
deference
to
this
court,
i
believe.
the
literal
requirements
of
a
final
decision
made
after
a
hearing,
have
been
construed
by
this
court,
in
a
liberal
manner,
so
that
i
am
prepared
to
argue
and
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
from
the
language
of
that
section,
may
very
well
be
and
in
my
opinion
is
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
under
section
405(g).
and
that
is
pointed
out
in
the
event,
this
court
may
not
see
fit
to
apply
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
again,
is
a
very
close
question
and
i
won’t
deny
it.
there
are
divided
authorities
as
to
whether
or
not
the
administrative
procedure
act
is
the
appropriate
basis
that
comes
later
in
the
argument.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
plaintiff
--
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
do
not
recall.
i
do
know
that
in
cappadora
they
said
that
there
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
in
cappadora,
the
jurisdictional
basis
was
whether
or
not
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
refusing
to
reopen
the
initial
determination.
the
court,
while
stating
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
review
that
question,
on
the
merits
they
found
that
there
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
record
will
show
that
the
record
of
the
secretary
was
never
produced
in
the
district
court.
and
the
court
of
appeals
points
it
out
in
its
very
decision
that
that
record
was
never
produced
until
the
case
was
up
by
the
day
of
oral
argument,
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
record
was
produced.
and
therefore,
the
district
court
not
only
failed
to
concerns
itself
with
the
record,
it
had
no
concern
in
obtaining
it
so
that
there
was
no
concern
of
the
record
in
the
district
court.
i
understand,
your
honor,
that
that
could
be
dispositive
of
the
question.
however,
in
this
particular
case,
we
never
got
as
far
as
the
merits.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
do
advance
a
theory
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
for
that
may
be
done.
and
if
i
can
skip
through
that,
i
would
say,
essentially,
what
you
say
is
correct
that
the
decision
to
be
reviewed
is
the
decision
not
to
reopen.
however,
at
page
18
of
the
respondent's
brief,
i
might
say
this
before
i
get
in
to
that,
that
i
advance
several
theories
of
how
section
405(g)
may
service
as
the
jurisdictional
base,
and
this
would
be
one
of
them.
it
is
to
be
noted
that
section
405(g)
states
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
60
days
or
within
such
further
time
as
the
secretary
may
allow.
and
when
that
provision
is
read
in
conjunction
with
the
reopening
regulation,
i
feel
that
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute
is
that
a
party
is
entitled
at
any
time
to
ask
for
reconsideration
or
rather
a
reopening
for
alleged
error
on
the
face
of
the
evidence.
that
the
205(g)
requirements
would
be
satisfied
because
there
had
been
a
hearing.
mr.
sanders
had
a
hearing
initially
and
when
he
goes
back
to
ask
for
a
review
of
the
decision
denying
the
reopening,
it
is
a
final
decision
under
section
405(g).
i
know
this
is
not
as
clear
as
it
might
be.
it
is
set
forth
in
the
brief
to
put
it
another
way.
because
section
405(g)
gives
the
secretary,
the
authority
to
extend
the
statute
of
limitations
and
since
the
secretary
has
extended
the
statute
of
limitations
in
cases
of
error
on
the
face
of
the
evidence,
i
say
basically,
it
is
possible
to
have
the
initial
determination
reviewed
but
only
not
on
the
merits
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
existence
of
error
on
the
face
of
the
evidence.
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
i
would
agree
with
that.
but
i
feel
this
that
the
regulation
is
in
effect,
it
was
promulgated,
and
i
believe
that
claimants
have
a
right
to
rely
on
its
continued
existence.
as
i
stated,
since
this
courts
decision
in
weinberger
v.
salfi
and
in
eldridge
v.
mathews,
the
section
405(g)
requirements
have
been
liberalized.
i
won’t
get
in
to
the
areas
prepared
to
get
in
to
the
waivable
and
non-waivable
which
is
referred
to
by
this
court
in
eldridge
but
basically,
what
seems
to
be
central
to
the
jurisdictional
facet
under
405(g)
is
in
the
language
of
the
weinberger
v.
salfi
that
a
claim
be
filed.
that
a
claim
for
benefits
be
filed
and
it
was
in
that
case
that
the
members
of
the
class
who
never
file
a
case
were
dismissed
out
because
they
had
never
filed
a
claim.
and
as
i
read
these
new
decisions,
other
elements
of
a
final
decision
after
a
hearing
can
be
waived,
they
can
be
dispensed
with
so
long
as
there
has
been
the
filing
of
a
claim
for
benefits.
and
i
would
direct
the
courts
attention
to
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
at
page
11,
for
the
theory
is
advanced
that
since
those
decisions
and
since
mr.
sander’s
second
application
constitutes
a
claim
for
benefits
under
section
405(b)
of
the
act
that
the
requirements
of
405(g)
have
been
satisfied
and
therefore
there
is
jurisdiction
under
405(g).
to
proceed,
finally
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
the
apa
is
a
jurisdictional
base.
again,
this
is
an
extremely
difficult
question,
a
question
upon
which
the
text
writers
have
agreed
and
disagreed.
but
i
would
say
this
that
--
mr.
william
a.
kowalski
not
a
thing,
your
honor,
not
in
my
estimation.
as
i
read
it
just
briefly
now,
if
anything,
i
would
say
would
be
supportive
of
the
fact
that
the
apa
is
available
in
this
type
case
because
the
amendments
specifically
refer
the
claims
against
governmental
officials
specifically.
i
would
point
out
too
that
the
apa
was
not
in
existence
on
the
social
security
act
was
enacted,
the
apa
was
enacted
in
1946
so
it
could
not
have
been
envisioned
in
1939
when
the
social
security
act
was
passed.
also,
that
by
excluding
section
1331,
in
section
405(h)
by
implication
other
sections
of
the
statute
are
not
excluded.
there
is
a
fancy
latin
name,
i
believe,
for
that
theory
which
escapes
me
right
now
but
by
implication,
the
apa
not
being
excluded
like
1331,
it
is
by
implication
included.
again
--
amicus
curiae
handled
this
part
of
the
brief
which
respondent
adopted
and
at
pages
41
and
42
the
many
cases
are
cited
where
the
courts
have
found
that
the
apa
is
a
jurisdictional
grant,
although
by
admission.
those
courts
did
not
thoroughly
analyze
that
specific
question,
and
there
were
three
cases
in
this
very
court
which
are
cited
in
the
brief.
united
states
supreme
court
cases
which
held
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
were
the
jurisdictional
basis
to
review
an
administrative
decision.
those
cases
likewise
are
cited
at
pages
41
and
42
of
the
amicus
curiae
brief,
i
say
about
them
other
time,
i
won’t
get
into
them.
but
the
very
plain
language
of
section
702
states,
again
in
effect,
there
shall
be
a
right
of
judicial
review
for
abuses
of
discretion
from
administrative
actions.
in
section
704
of
the
act,
the
effect
is
without
quoting
it
that
where
there
is
no
other
way
of
getting
into
court
for
an
abuse
of
an
administrative
discretion
than
the
apa
affords
an
opportunity
to
go
to
court.
final
comment,
as
i
said,
the
secretary
has
made
much
of
the
fact
that
if
petitions
to
reopen
are
allowed,
there
would
be
a
flood
of
re-litigation.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
fact.
you
can
only
re-litigate,
litigate,
a
petition
to
reopen
once.
once
the
district
court
passes
upon
that,
it
becomes
res
judicata,
it
can
not
be
litigated
again.
the
court
in
cappadora
versus
celebrezze,
very
wisely
made
the
observation
too,
that
quoting
from
the
case,
a
review
of
refuses
to
reopen
necessarily
limited
to
abuse
of
discretion
would
impose
a
relatively
spiked
burden
on
the
agency
and
the
courts.
thank
you.
