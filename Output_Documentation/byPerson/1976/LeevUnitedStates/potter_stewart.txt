justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bauer
is
there
anything
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
or
in
the
local
rules
of
this
district
court
or
northern
district
of
indiana
that
set
a
time
period
within
which
such
a
motion
could
be
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
at
any
stage.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
rule,
in
your
submission,
means
that
if
the
motion
is
made
and
granted
after
the
taking
of
any
evidence
and
there
is
an
automatic
double
jeopardy
defense
to
another
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
what
you
tell
me
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
permit
that
the
motion
to
be
made
at
anytime
before
or
after
jeopardy
attaches?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
motion
was
made
after
jeopardy
attaches
and
has
granted,
then
there
is
built-in
double
jeopardy
defense
to
any
future
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
if
denied
there
is
no
problem,
no
double
jeopardy
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
not
a
mistrial,
the
basis
of
this
motion
is
that
the
person
should
never
have
been
held
before
the
court
on
a
defective
indictment
such
as
this.
the
trial
should
never
begun
that
is
the
basis
of
the
motion.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
your
brother
on
the
other
side
would
say
that
the
difference
might
be
in
the
interest
that
has
been
emphasized
in
some
of
our
double
jeopardy
decisions.
the
interest
in
the
defendant
of
having
the
first
trial
effect,
reach
a
conclusion,
reach
a
verdict,
where
is
that
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
motion
has
been
filed
two
weeks
before
the
scheduled
date
of
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
had
not
been
acted
on
and
the
judge
did
the
same
things
he
did
here.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
are
not
really
relying
on
the
point
you
just
made?
justice
potter
stewart
you
want
to
win
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
for
matter
he
has
not
objected?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
i
understand,
excuse
me.
