mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
he
might
have
made
it
earlier,
your
honor
but
in
fact
as
the
record
indicates
he
was
the
second
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
and
he
was
appointed
only
seven
weeks
before
the
trial
and
it
clearly
could
have
been
made
earlier
but
it
might
not
have
been
reasonable
to
have
done
so
and
there
is
no
contention
that
the
objection
here
was
not
timely.
clearly,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provide
for
objection
at
any
time
during
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
your
honor,
i
think
there
were
two
responses
to
that
inquiry:
one,
in
certain
circumstances
the
time
may
be
so
late
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
judge
to
rule.
on
the
facts
of
this
case
however,
when
petitioner’s
counsel
made
the
objection,
the
petitioner’s
counsel
cited
a
single
indiana
state
case.
it
would
have
been
very,
very
easy
for
the
trial
judge
at
that
time
to
have
taken
a
two
minute
or
five
minute
recess,
looked
up
the
single
case;
the
rule
was
as
simple
as
it
can
be.
now,
that
is
only
known
by
hindsight
but
i
suggest
that
the
alternatives
available
at
that
time
would
have
been
to
look
up
that
single
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
your
honor.
this
was
a
bench
trial.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
what
had
happened
your
honor
was
that
the
case
had
been
called;
the
prosecution
had
made
its
opening
statement
which
lasted
all
of
about
45
seconds.
the
defendant’s
counsel
then
appeared
and
at
the
very
first
opportunity
on
that
morning
defense
counsel
did
raise
the
objection.
now,
as
i
suggested
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
it
is
not
clear
from
the
procedure
whether
he
could
have.
as
i
suggest
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
motion
was
made
before
evidence
commence.
therefore
under
the
tests
in
this
case,
it
was
at
a
stage
before
jeopardy
attached.
had
the
motion
been
acted
upon
at
that
time,
there
would
have
been
no
bar
whatsoever
to
correct
any
information
of
having
a
proper
trial,
so
that
the
defendant’s
motion
was
clearly
made
before
there
would
have
been
any
double
jeopardy
inquiry
implicated.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
the
court
in
the
serfass
case
says
that
in
a
jury
trial,
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
jury
is
in
paneled
and
that
in
a
non-jeopardy
case,
jeopardy
attaches
when
evidence
commences.
now,
the
testimony
had
not
yet
begun,
so
it
is
our
position
that
jeopardy
had
not
attached
at
that
time
and
it
seems
that
in
this
case,
defense
counsel
had
given
the
court
an
equally
important,
had
given
the
prosecution
an
opportunity
to
correct
that
mistake
which
was
of
the
prosecution’s
own
creation.
but
yet
the
prosecution
sat
there
and
did
absolutely
nothing.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
what
petitioner’s
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
it
is
true
your
honor
that
he
did
not
say
after
the
motion
was
denied
that
the
judge
should
indeed
take
a
recess.
i
respectfully
suggest
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
in
fact
your
honor,
although
it
is
not
excuse
that
the
trial
counsel.
in
fact
there
was
an
indication
in
the
record
that
the
trial
counsel
may
have
misunderstood
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court.
there
is
the
suggestion
that
when
all
the
evidence
was
concluded
that
petitioner’s
counsel
thought
that
the
motion
had
indeed
been
denied
and
not
taken
under
advisement.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
it
would
appear
so
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
said
your
honor;
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
would
excuse
what
petitioner’s
counsel
did.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no
question
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
think
that
the
objection
that
counsel
made
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
carries
with
it
implicitly
the
request
that
the
court
will
grant
a
recess
and
look
up
the
case.
defense
counsel
did
not
merely
say
the
information
is
deficient.
defense
counsel
cited
the
court
to
a
specific
indiana
case
directly
on
point
which
held
that
the
information
of
this
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
he
read
only
the
citation
to
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
it
would
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
second
response
to
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
think
the
other
response
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
that
there
is
no
way
for
him
to
lose,
yes
there
is
a
way
for
him
to
lose,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
case
like
this
the
court
could
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
the
government
had
a
number
of
alternatives.
one
is
that
the
government
could
have
joined
in
the
motion
of
the
defense
to
dismiss
the
information.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
a
second
alternative
would
have
been
to
make
a
motion
under
rule
7(e)
to
amend
the
information.
a
third
opportunity
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
the
government
clearly
under
its
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
7(e)
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
the
court
--
the
cases
in
this
court
may
clear
that
the
responsibility
for
having
a
proper
trial
lies
not
on
the
defendant
but
lies
with
the
prosecution
and
with
court.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
it
is
not
a
question
of
not
having
to
object
but
having
objected;
having
performed
its
responsibility
that
if
there
is
any
duty
the
duty
already
was
on
the
prosecution
to
trial
court.
the
defendant
fulfilled
his
responsibility
by
pointing
out
to
the
trial
court
and
pointing
out
to
the
prosecution
the
deficiency.
now,
there
were
as
i
said
three
alternatives.
one
would
have
been
to
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
think
the
argument
could
also
be
made,
but
the
citation
makes
it
even
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
the
mere
observation
like
that
i
think
might
be
insufficient
but
here
we
do
not
have
a
mere
observation.
here
we
have
a
formal
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
an
oral
motion
made
in
court.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
do
not
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is
true
that
the
prosecution
was
not
given
advance
notice
of
the
motion.
but
as
i
suggest
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question,
the
responsibility
for
having
a
proper
trial
is
not
solely
on
the
defendant.
indeed,
it
is
principally
on
the
prosecution
with
trial
court.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
simply
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
your
honor.
one
can
only
speculate
but
as
i
suggested
earlier
in
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question.
the
counsel
mr.
swanson
was
second
counsel
for
petitioner.
the
first
counsel
had
been
appointed
for
the
arraignment
stage
and
after
arraignment;
he
then
asked
to
withdraw
himself
when
he
became
associated
with
the
magistrate.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
it
certainly
should
not
be
the
last
thing
he
does
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
am
suggesting
that
may
have
happened.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
am
not
attempting
to
excuse
mr.
swanson’s
conduct.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
responsibility
for
having
a
proper
trial
was
not
solely
on
the
defendant.
indeed,
it
was
not
principally
on
the
defendant.
the
principal
responsibility
is
on
the
prosecution
in
the
trial
court.
i
would
ask
the
question,
not
why
was
mr.
swanson
late
in
his
motion?
i
think
the
more
appropriate
question
is,
why
did
the
government
drafted
efficient
information?
and
then
instead
of
asking,
why
did
mr.
swanson
wait
seven
weeks
to
notice
that
defect?
why
did
the
government
wait
four
months
and
not
even
noticed
it
on
the
morning
of
trial
when
the
very
defect
was
pointed
out?
the
prosecution
was
the
one
that
made
the
mistake;
the
prosecution
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
indeed,
he
would.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
there
certainly
is.
and
in
fact,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
mere
error
in
the
information
is
sufficient
to
foreclose
a
second
trial
in
the
situation
you
have
described.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
specifically
provide
that
the
motion
is
timely
at
any
stage.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
at
any
stage.
the
rule
says,
"it
may
be
being
noticed
at
any
time
during
the
proceedings
or
anytime
during
dependency
of
the
proceedings
by
the
court."
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
your
honor
that
is
not
our
submission.
our
submission
is
that
the
reason
that
double
jeopardy
forecloses
a
second
trial
in
this
situation
is
because
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
information
was
made
prior
to
the
attachment
of
jeopardy.
there
were
numerous
alternatives
available
to
the
trial
court
to
continuing
the
fashion
it
did,
numerous
alternatives
available
to
the
prosecution
to
continue
it.
yet
notwithstanding
those
alternatives,
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecution
allowed
the
trial
to
continue
not
only
into
the
jeopardy
stage,
but
through
the
entire
evidentiary
stage
to
the
very
moment
when
the
verdict
should
have
been
forthcoming
and
then
at
that
stage
attempted
to
subject
the
defendant
to
a
second
trial
by
not
rendering
a
verdict
and
dismissing
at
that
stage.
now,
in
response
to
your
honor’s
question,
a
different
situation
would
be
post
if
the
motion
were
made
at
some
time
and
the
court
acted
upon
it
promptly.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
no
your
honor,
i
think
not.
if
the
motion
is
made
mid-trial
and
acted
upon
at
that
time
granted
mid-trial,
then
we
have
the
situation
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
if
it
is
granted
at
that
time,
then
we
do
have
the
situation
to
which
the
respondent
refer,
the
dinitz
kind
of
situation
or
the
somerville
kind
of
situation,
in
which
one
can
explain
that
on
one
of
two
grounds.
either
that
the
defendant
had
indeed
requested
in
this
trial
himself,
and
the
trial
court
was
giving
the
defendant
no
more
than
he
ask
for.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
that
is
indeed
true
your
honor.
now,
the
court
has
made
clear
in
cases
all
the
way
back
to
1896
in
ball
that
if
a
person
is
tried
and
convicted
pursuant
to
a
defective
indictment,
that
that
person
and
the
indictment
has
been
challenged
on
appeal
that
that
person
can
indeed
be
retried
without
double
jeopardy’s
problems.
but
in
this
case,
what
we
have
is
the
situation
in
which
at
the
time
the
motion
was
made,
the
defendant
had
made
the
motion
prior
to
the
attachment
of
jeopardy.
there
were
a
whole
host
of
alternatives
available
to
the
trial
court
and
to
the
prosecution
to
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
your
honor,
there
is
a
stronger
case
for
a
dismissal
because
the
dismissal
as
we
suggest
in
the
jenkins
case
may
well
be
ambivalent
and
ambiguous.
it
may
be
arguably
a
dismissal
on
the
merits
if
it
is
even
though
mid-trial
that
would
preclude
a
retrial.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
here
it
was
clearly
not
a
dismissal
on
the
merits.
the
court
characterizes
it
as
a
dismissal,
but
in
our
view,
your
honor
whether
it
is
characterized
as
a
mistrial
or
characterized
as
a
dismissal,
the
result
in
this
case
must
be
the
same,
because
although
the
motion
was
made
prior
to
the
attachment
of
jeopardy,
the
court
erroneously
allowed
the
case
to
proceed
into
the
jeopardy
stage
all
the
way
up
to
the
would
be
verdict
stage
and
then
dismissed
or
declared
a
mistrial
without
giving
the
defendant
a
benefit
of
a
verdict.
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
enunciates
is
a
dual
policy.
it
enunciates
a
policy
against
repetitive
trials.
it
also
enunciates
a
policy
in
favor
of
once
the
trial
has
commenced
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
verdict
on
the
merits.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
indeed,
your
honor,
the
judge
made
that
observation
and
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
erase
that
from
the
record.
but
i
would
suggest
that
what
the
double
jeopardy
cases
provided
starting
with
wade
v.
hunter
is
that
one
of
the
valued
rights
that
a
defendant
has
is
the
right
to
get
a
verdict.
and
the
observation
in
this
case
no
matter
how
much
we
analogized
it
to
a
verdict
was
not
a
verdict.
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
that
a
trial
court
must
do
in
a
bench
trial
is
decide
on
guilt
or
innocence.
and
one
of
the
things
then
that
we
would
want
to
have
is
that
that
determination
be
a
deliberative,
reflective
one.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
think
if
there
had
been
a
formal
verdict
of
guilty
followed
by
a
dismissal
afterwards,
our
case
would
be
different.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
probably
--
although
i
am
not
willing
to
concede
it
--
but
might
probably
permit
a
retrial.
that
would
be
somewhere
between
the
ball
case
and
this
case.
that
situation
however
your
honor
might
implicate
due
process
considerations
nonetheless.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
yes.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
you
mean
the
ruling
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
yes,
they
could
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
there
could
be
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
the
reason
for
that
your
honor
was
because
in
your
--
the
situation
which
you
posit,
there
was
indeed
a
verdict
from
which
there
is
an
appeal.
and
no
matter
how
we
analogize
it,
the
judge’s
outburst
here
was
not
a
verdict.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
there
was
a
continuum
of
errors.
there
were
errors
at
the
beginning
of
trial.
well
i
should
even
start
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
i
would
not
your
honor,
although
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
what
the
trial
judge
should
have
done
was
at
least
declared
a
five
minute
recess
to
determine
whether
the
question
was
complicated.
now,
if
indeed
the
question
were
one
that
would
take
two
hours
or
two
days
research
in
view
of
the
untimeliness
of
the
motion,
it
might
be
appropriate
to
continue
the
trial
at
that
time,
might
be.
i
would
suggest
however
that
a
recess
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
difficult
question
that
recess
which
would
have
only
taken
five
minutes
would
certainly
not
be
inappropriate.
and
in
fact,
i
would
go
beyond
that
and
say
in
this
case
that
was
not
the
only
alternative
at
the
beginning
of
trial.
it
was
not
only
that
the
trial
judge
could
sua
sponte
have
asked
for
a
recess,
but
the
us
attorney
is
also
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
indiana
and
should
know
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
it
is
not
the
difficulty
of
the
motion
that
is
the
determinant
your
honor.
but
what
we
have
in
the
situation
was
a
motion
which
granted
with
hindsight
was
as
plain
as
could
be.
in
fact
judge
ashba
(ph)
said
if
the
lower
court
of
mine
had
drafted
something
like
that
i
would
send
him
back
for
refresher
course.
it
was
not
an
egregious
mistake.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
your
honor,
i
referred
to
that
earlier
and
i
must
respectively
suggest
that
i
do
not
know
the
answer.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
one
answer
may
be,
he
did
not
look
at
the
information
at
all
as
soon
as
he
did
look
at
the
information,
it
leapt
from
the
paper.
i
did
not
suggest
that
that
was
an
appropriate
form
of
pretrial
strategy
but
the
fact
that
it
was
obvious
and
the
fact
that
he
did
not
catch
it
earlier
are
not
necessarily
inconsistent.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
an
inappropriate
response.
in
addition
i
think
it
is
important
in
terms
of
timeliness;
it
is
important
to
focus
on
two
questions:
one,
whether
it
was
timely
for
the
purpose
of
raising
it
later;
and
second
one,
whether
it
was
timely
for
double
jeopardy
purposes?
i
have
suggested
your
honor
that
had
the
motion
only
been
made
after
conviction
and
appeal.
although
it
would
be
timely
at
that
stage,
that
would
certainly
not
bar
a
retrial.
but
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here.
here
we
have
a
motion
which
is
not
only
timely
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
provide.
it
is
also
timely
in
the
double
jeopardy
sense.
it
is
timely
because
it
was
made
before
jeopardy
attached
giving
both
prosecution
and
trial
court
a
number
of
alternatives
to
proceeding
in
a
fashion
in
which
double
jeopardy
would
attach.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
that
would
be
closer
to
the
somerville
case.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
that
is
right.
and
then
in
fact,
i
think
the
inquiry
would
have
to
be
at
that
stage
considering
the
reasonableness
of
the
alternatives
would
a
recess
be
appropriate?
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
if
indeed,
had
the
jury
been
impaneled
and
the
motion
was
only
made
at
that
time
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
impaneled
and
sworn,
jeopardy
attaches
onto
the
serfass
rule.
if
the
defendant
then
had
made
the
motion
only
then,
i
would
suggest
that
once
again
as
this
court
has
suggested
in
recent
cases,
what
the
trial
court
would
have
to
do
is
waive
the
alternatives.
it
may
be
at
that
time
since
the
jury
was
already
sitting
there
that
a
recess
would
be
inappropriate.
the
fact
as
in
this
case,
it
was
not
a
jury
case
and
the
important
thing
to
focus
on
is,
what
are
the
alternatives?
a
recess
would
have
been
so
simple.
why
did
the
trial
court
judge
not
just
say,
okay
a
single
case
has
been
cited
to
me,
let
me
take
five
minutes
to
look
it
up.
why
did
the
prosecution
just
sit
there
and
do
nothing.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
it
might
have
been
that
the
judge
thought
that
counsel
was
not
objecting
although
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
counsel
misunderstood
the
trial
court’s
ruling.
but
leaving
that
aside,
if
the
defense
counsel
had
been
deliberately
attempting
to
use
this
as
a
device
to
have
double
jeopardy
apply,
then
it
would
have
made
sense
for
him
not
to
make
the
motion,
until
evidence
commence.
then
it
would
have
been
a
double
jeopardy
situation.
what
defense
counsel
was
doing
was
making
the
motion
at
a
time
before
jeopardy
attach,
giving
the
trial
court
and
giving
the
prosecution
full
opportunity
to
save
themselves
from
an
error
completely
of
the
prosecution’s
making.
there
was
a
prosecution
that
drafted
that
faulty
information
not
the
defendant.
so
defense
counsel
gave
them
every
opportunity
to
rescue
themselves
not
only
pointed
out
the
defect,
but
cited
an
indiana
state
case
and
what
did
prosecution
do,
sat
there
and
did
nothing.
alternatives,
he
could
have
joined
in
the
motion
to
dismiss.
he
could
have
moved
to
amend.
he
could
have
suggested
a
recess.
the
cases
in
this
court
may
clear
that
the
duty
should
not
be
on
the
defendant
to
not
only
raise
it
but
continually
raise
it
and
protect
his
rights.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
okay,
they
could
have
argued
it
right
there.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
i
think
the
question
is
why
not
ask
the
government?
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
why
not
ask
the
government
that?
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
why
not
ask
the
judge
for
that?
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
since
i
was
not
in
that
courtroom
i
cannot
tell
you,
your
honor.
but
it
seems
to
me
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that
is
not
a
reasonable
requirement.
the
alternatives
were
so
clear.
the
duty
on
the
government
is
there
and
to
say
because
the
defendant
did
not
jump
up
and
say
your
honor,
i
want
to
stop.
now
remember
this
was
a
bench
trial.
the
judge
was
not
only
going
to
be
the
person
who
ruled
on
the
motion;
he
was
going
to
be
the
one
who
was
the
tryer
of
fact.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
well,
he
gains
then
the
possibility
that
that
case
is
the
only
case
that
the
defendant
has
to
sit
through.
one
of
the
things
that
double
jeopardy
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
in
my
view
of
the
law,
if
in
this
situation
the
judge
does
not
render
a
verdict,
then
no
second
trial
can
be
held.
one
of
the
protections
of
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
not
only
do
i
admit
it,
i
asked
why
did
not
the
government
do
it?
rule
70
makes
it
clear
that
they
could
have
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
do
not
admit
that
your
honor
because
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
suggest
that
the
judge
--
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
suggest
that
the
judge
had
an
outburst
of
frustration
because
the
judge
had
let
that
whole
trial
go
ahead,
and
the
judge
recognized,
finally
he
had
made
a
mistake.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
may
i
respond
to
that?
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
presupposition
which
the
government
proceeds
on
in
the
entire
brief
that
this
man
would
have
been
convicted.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
wade
v.
hunter
says
is
any
time
a
trial
commences,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
man
may
be
acquitted,
and
although
in
this
case
the
odds
are
99.75%
clear
that
he
would
not
have
been
acquitted.
the
judge's
outburst,
i
must
concede,
is
as
close
to
a
verdict
as
one
can
get.
it
was
not
a
verdict.
i
think
that
this
court
cannot
allow
the
outcome
of
these
cases
to
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
judge
does
give
some
kind
of
an
outburst
like
that
in
the
nature,
the
quality
of
that
outburst.
even
there
is
a
verdict
or
there
is
not.
if
there
is
not
a
verdict,
it
seems
to
me
then
one
has
the
right
to
assume
that
if
there
had
been
a
verdict,
that
verdict
might
have
been
one
of
acquittal
as
well
as
conviction.
and
having
that
one
of
acquittal
then
the
government’s
presupposition
is
wrong,
because
then
there
could
clearly
not
have
been
a
retrial.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
i
can
appreciate
the
difficulty
the
government
that
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
there
is
a
responsibility
that
are
not
only
for
knowing
the
federal
statutes
but
what
may
sometimes
be
difficult
state
statutes.
it
would
be
a
clearer
case
for
us
in
terms
of
the
default
of
the
prosecution
had
it
not
been
an
underlying
state
crime.
but
here,
we
are
not
talking
about
a
difficult
state
crime.
we
are
talking
about
the
simple
crime
of
theft
and
every
first
year
law
student
learns,
your
honor,
that
theft
includes
not
only
the
taking,
but
in
taking
with
the
intent
to
know.
the
prosecution
here,
the
members
of
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office,
are
members
of
the
bar
of
state
of
indiana,
and
it
seems
to
me
reasonable
in
this
case
to
assume
that
although
they
are
not
required
to
know
every
bit
of
indiana
statute,
they
can
know
what
the
indiana
theft
law
is.
that
is
not
putting
an
undue
burden.
and
if
the
prosecution,
if
the
u.s.
attorney’s
office,
drafts
a
faulty
indictment
or
faulty
information,
and
allows
that
to
continue
for
four
months,
if
that
trial
is
pointed
out
even
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
a
u.s.
attorney
knows
indiana
theft,
as
well
as
an
indiana
district
attorney.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
your
honor,
if
he
knew
it,
i
have
no
question
but
that
he
should
have.
mr.
joseph
p.
bauer
if
he
found
out
about
it
five
weeks
before
trial,
and
then
waited
to
the
day
of
trial,
i
suggest
that,
as
your
honor,
i
think
is
implying
that
that
is
inappropriate,
not
only
inappropriate
but
unbecoming
an
officer
of
the
court.
so
the
simple
answer
is,
if
that
happens,
yes
and
going
beyond
that;
if
he
knew
when
he
made
the
motion
that
failing
to
rule
out
only
at
that
time
would
raise
the
problem
we
are
discussing
this
morning,
again,
there
is
no
question,
but
that
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
he
should
have.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
the
record
is
there
as
to
whether
he
did.
i
have
not
spoken
to
him.
i
have
never
discussed
the
question
with
him
so
the
two
of
us
can
only
speculate
as
to
what
he
was
doing.
thank
you
very
much.
