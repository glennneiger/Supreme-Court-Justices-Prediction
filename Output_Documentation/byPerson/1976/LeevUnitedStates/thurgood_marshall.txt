justice
thurgood
marshall
and
petitionerâ€™s
counsel
did
absolutely
nothing,
he
did
not
object.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that
the
judge
could
have
gone
out
and
looked
at
the
case
right
quick,
he
did
not
suggest
that
to
the
judge,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
do
anything
but
filed
a
motion
which
he
can
now
use.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
not
object
at
all?
the
judge
says,
i
will
pass
on
when
i
get
time
to
look
at
that
and
counsel
remains
silent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
he
did
not
understand
what
the
judge
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
a
judge
raise
at
a
guy
who
will
understand
what
he
says
other
than
to
say
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
record
is
correct
that
the
judge
said
specifically,
i
will
pass
on
this
when
i
get
time
to
look
at
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
counsel
said
nothing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
i
say
he
acted
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
read
the
--
did
he
read
anything
from
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
did
not
he
read
it?
he
said
was
so
clear,
why
did
not
he
say
it?
the
bottom
line
and
opinion
says
quote
unquote
that
will
give
the
judge
a
little
something,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
one
response
is
that
under
york
(ph)
theory,
he
can
make
the
motion
and
then
there
is
no
way
for
him
to
lose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
could
the
government
have
done
at
that
stage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
the
government
could
have
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whose
case
is
this,
the
government
or
the
defense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
why
you
do
not
have
to
object.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
have
made
the
same
argument
if
he
had
not
cited
the
one
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
go
so
far
as
if
he
said
i
think
the
indictment
is
insufficient?
justice
thurgood
marshall
written?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
when
a
lawyer
defends
a
case
lastly,
he
does
not
read
the
information?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
an
excuse?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
nobody
raised
the
question,
and
then
he
was
convicted,
he
would
go
to
jail,
wouldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there
is
a
little
bit
responsibility
on
the
petitioner,
a
little
bit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
still
another
point;
you
said
he
was
not
then
guilty.
i
thought
the
judge
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bauer,
why
do
you
consistently
say
he
needed
a
recess?
there
was
no
jury.
they
did
not
need
a
recess.
they
could
have
argued
it
right
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
did
not
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
not
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
not
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
his
motion.
why
did
not
he
continue
to
argue
and
say,
"if
your
honor
please,
i
think
we
all
decide
this
now,
let
me
read
this
case
to
you."
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
admit
the
information
could
have
been
amended?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
they
had
been
amended,
then
your
man
would
be
in
jail?
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do
not
admit
what
the
judge
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
he
is
a
guilty
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
about
the
point,
that
it
could
have
been
amended?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
to
put
that
burden
on
him,
but
i
mean
if
it
had
been
amended
at
that
stage,
he
could
have
been
convicted,
because
of
the
possibility
that
he
is
convicted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
would
not
be
here
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
this
case,
the
only
thing
the
petitioner
did
was
to
file
a
motion
before
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
what
else
did
he
have
to
do
and
suppose
he
had
not
filed
a
motion
before
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
he
had
not
filed
a
motion
before
trial
and
the
judge
after
the
trial
had
dismissed
the
information
on
his
own?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why,
because
the
defendant
did
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
defedant
had
not
said
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
as
i
understand
the
usual
rule
for
the
defendant
waiving
is
double
jeopardy
point
that
he
did
some
on
his
own.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
did
not
do
anything
here
during
the
trial,
nothing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
could
--
he
have
stocked
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
say
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
you
just
found
me
guilty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
means
if
the
judge
says,
"i
am
going
to
dismiss
this
indictment."
he
says,
"oh
no,
you
have
to
find
me
guilty,
i
can
only
stand
for
that."
