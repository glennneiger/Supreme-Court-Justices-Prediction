justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
after
finding
it
guilty?
justice
byron

white
and
then
the
defendant
appeals,
and
then
he
appeals
the
denial
of
his
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
appeal
of
denial
of
his
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
at
that
time
he
is
in
the
ball
park.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
the
judge
had
entered
a
formal
conclusion
that
the
defendant
was
guilty.
but
then
granted
the
motion,
sort
of
an
arrest
of
judgment,
and
then
the
government
had
reindicted
them
just
like
they
did
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
what
is
the
difference
in
terms
of
the
double
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
indictment
has
been
dismissed,
and
the
government
reindicts
him,
wants
to
try
him
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
well,
i
know
you
do
not
think
there
is
no
problem
in
this
case
either
but
why
do
you
think
there
is
this
problem
in
the
latter
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
not
talking
about
an
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
my
example,
the
matter
the
court
operates
on
or
regresses
itself
to
after
verdict
is
something
that
the
defendant
instituted
before
evidence
had
been
taken.
and
he
never
renews
it,
never
pushes
it,
and
the
judges
delays
acting
on
it
until
after
the
verdict.
now
what
difference
is
that
case
--
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
not
saying
it
has
got
any,
but
i
do
not
see
the
difference
between
the
two
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
apply
this
rule
even
though
he
initially
had
not
asked
for
it
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
trial
judge
on
his
own
motion
for
some
reason
that
the
defendant
has
not
focused
on
dismisses
the
indictment
during
trial
and
the
defendant
does
not
object?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
think
that
is
contrary
to
jorn?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
jorn
is
just
unique?
