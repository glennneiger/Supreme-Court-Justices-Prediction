what
about
the
next
sentence,
“i
was
in
this
case
after
the
time
i
had
passed
for
such
a
motion
to
be
made.”
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
got
to
refer
to
that
too,
shouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
but
it
certainly
explains.
i
should
think
on
the
face
of
it,
why
it
is
he
did
not
make
it
until
he
did.
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
there
is
not,
he
may
have
been
wrong,
what
was
he
eight
months
at
the
bar
or
something
like
that?
