harry
a.
blackmun
first
of
all,
could
not
he
make
the
objection
before
the
opening
statement
on
the
part
of
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
what
is
your
position
that
jeopardy
have
not
attached?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bauer
let
me
ask
you
for
this
question.
this
case
comes
here
as
an
assimilative
crime
doesn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
any
different
if
it
had
been
a
routine
federal
offense
rather
than
a
state
offense
brought
into
federal
court
because
of
the
location
or
the
site
of
the
crime?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
suggesting
there
is
another
ground
for
there
being
no
double
jeopardy,
here
namely
he
is
being
tried
for
a
different
crime?
