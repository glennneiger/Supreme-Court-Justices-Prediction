justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
bauer,
may
i
ask
you
again,
how
can
one
be
sure
that
this
was
not
a
deliberate
bypass
when
counsel
for
defendant
made
no
objection
to
the
procedure
that
judge
followed.
the
judge
made
it
very
clear
you
needed
to
look
up
the
law.
counsel
was
present
and
he
remained
silent.
if
you
have
been
the
judge,
would
not
you
have
felt
that
you
had
the
questions
of
counsel
and
proceeding
with
the
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
a
child
of
stealing
two
wallets
from
the
blind
operator
of
a
newsstand
in
the
lobby
of
the
united
states
post
office.
during
his
first
trial,
the
district
court
granted
petitioner's
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
indictment
had
failed
to
specify
accurately
the
crime
charged.
petitioner
was
retried
and
convicted.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
the
petition
of
second
trial
violated
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
hold
that
it
did
not.
we
think
the
principles
explained
in
our
decision
in
the
last
term
in
the
united
states
against
dinitz
are
applicable.
as
the
dismissal
was
granted
at
petitioner's
request
without
judicial
or
prosecutorial
overreaching
and
on
--
and
on
the
ground
consistent
with
retrial,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bought
re-prosecution.
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
separate
concurring
opinions.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
