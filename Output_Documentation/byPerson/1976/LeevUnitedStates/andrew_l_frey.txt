mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
latest
in
the
line
of
cases
extending
back
to
united
states
v.
perez
in
1824.
it
involved
the
question
of
the
permissibility
of
retrying
a
defendant
whose
first
trial
terminated
prior
to
a
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
by
the
finder
of
fact.
it
is,
in
our
view,
perhaps
the
easiest
to
decide
of
all
of
those
cases,
because
it
is
governed
by
a
clear
and
simple
consideration
that
it
was
the
defendant
who
thought
the
pre-verdict
termination
and
he
got
what
he
requested.
and
before
turning
to
the
body
of
my
argument,
i
just
want
to
make
one
point
about
the
facts
just
to
be
clear.
at
two
places
in
petitioner’s
brief,
page
17
of
his
opening
brief
and
page
4
of
his
reply
brief,
he
says
that
the
defendant
objected
to
proceeding
with
the
trial.
now,
we
have
been
over
this
a
little
bit
this
morning.
i
cannot
find
in
the
appendix
anything
that
remotely
resembles
an
objection
to
proceeding
with
the
trial.
what
happened
was
he
came
in;
waited
until
the
trial
began
and
the
prosecutor
had
made
his
opening
statement.
he
then
raised
his
objection
and
the
court
upgraded
him
for
the
untimeliness
of
raising
it
and
explained
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
the
motion
at
that
time.
now
on
page
8
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
statement
which
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
and
i
just
wanted
to
say
what
we
think
it
means.
it
is
near
the
top.
mr.
swanson,
the
defense
counsel
says
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
page
8
of
the
appendix.
it
says,
“i
realized
this
is
probably
a
little
bit
out
of
order,
but
i
think
it
should
be
considered
by
the
court
at
this
time.”
now,
we
do
not
take
that
to
be
an
objection
to
proceeding
with
the
trial
when
the
judge
later
on
refused
to
grant
the
motion
at
this
time,
but
rather
an
apology
on
the
part
of
counsel
for
the
fact
that
he
was
so
late.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
wondered
about
that?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
not
think
that
it
has
any.
first
of
all,
i
cannot
find
in
the
rules,
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
about
that
earlier.
i
could
find
no
reference
in
the
local
rules.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
believe.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
rule
of
court
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
whatever
--
i
do
not
know
what
the
explanation
is
or
why
he
did
not
raise
it.
i
know
of
no
rule
that
would
have
prevented
him
from
raising
it
sooner
or
no
requirement
that
he
should
wait
until
the
trial
was
commenced
to
raise
it.
i
merely
want
to
be
sure
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
on
the
fact
that
he
did
not
object
the
proceeding
with
the
trial
once
the
judge
had
tentatively
denied
his
motion
subject
to
reconsideration
at
a
later
point
after
recess.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
now
it
could
be
made
in
the
form
of
a
motion
and
the
rest
of
judgment
in
effect.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
an
objection
to
proceeding
with
the
trial
in
a
sense
yes.
but
it
can
be
made
at
anytime.
we
do
not
dispute
that
he
could
make
it
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
under
the
rules,
the
question
is
whether
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
his
delay
of
making
the
motion
is
--
the
timing
of
his
motion
is
significant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
not
think
it
would
take
a
--
after
all,
as
i
will
get
to
when
i
get
into
the
body
of
my
argument,
to
us
the
critical
factor
in
these
cases
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
is
that
the
defendant
has
the
choice
whether
to
proceed
with
the
trial
or
whether
to
stop
the
trial.
now,
the
defendant
may
say,
your
honor
there
is
a
double
jeopardy
problem
in
this
case,
i
do
not
want
to
be
subjected
to
a
trial
on
a
faulty
information,
because
if
i
am
convicted
the
result
will
be
that
i
will
have
to
be
--
and
that
set
aside
as
i
know
it
must
be,
the
result
will
be
that
i
will
have
to
be
subjected
to
two
trials,
he
can
say
that.
on
the
other
hand
as
mr.
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
he
may
very
well
prefer
to
go
ahead
with
the
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
is
in
effect
what
the
judges
did
here.
he
tentatively
denied
the
motion
subject
to
reconsideration.
later
on
the
question
is
what
significance
is
to
be
attached
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
made
it
at
the
particular
point
that
he
did
make
it.
now,
we
start
our
argument
from
a
premise
that
is
unchallenged
by
petitioner
and
indeed
that
is
not
subject
to
serious
challenge
having
them
conclusively
settled
many
years
ago
in
the
ball
case.
if
a
defendant
is
placed
on
trial
on
a
defective
indictment
and
that
trial
leads
to
a
conviction,
they
subsequently
set
aside
because
of
the
defect
in
the
indictment,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
bar
a
second
trial.
now
this
is
so
despite
the
fact
that
the
second
trial
will
subject
the
defendant
to
continuing
embarrassment,
uncertainty,
anxiety,
and
insecurity,
will
renew
the
ordeal
that
the
trial
itself
may
represent,
and
will
subject
them
to
the
added
expense
that
further
defense
ordinarily
entails.
all
of
these
considerations
--
i
do
not
mean
to
minimize
them,
because
they
principally
underlie
the
strong
policy
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
against
multiple
trials
and
criminal
cases
--
have
been
placed
in
the
scales
by
this
court,
and
they
have
been
found
to
be
outweighed
by
the
even
stronger
societal
interest
and
fair
trials
ending
in
just
judgments.
now,
in
view
of
the
decision
in
ball,
it
seems
quite
clear
--
and
i
think
my
colleague
in
effect
conceded
it
--
that
had
the
court
erroneously
denied
petitioner’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
information,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
have
barred
a
retrial.
petitioner’s
argument
is
that
because
the
district
court
ruled
correctly
and
dismissed
the
information
in
this
case,
he
cannot
be
retried,
but
if
the
court
had
erred
and
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss,
he
could
have
been
retried
to
state
the
proposition.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
after
finding
it
guilty.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
or
an
arrest
of
judgment
has
granted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
there
is
no
difficulty
whatsoever
with
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
between
what?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
where
an
arrest
of
judgment
is
granted,
i
think
if
settled
in
effect
that
is
equivalent
to
what
happened
in
tateo
where
the
district
court
in
the
collateral
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
in
tateo
there
was
no
appeal,
there
was
a
collateral
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
set
aside
its
judgment
of
conviction
and
then
a
fresh
indictment
was
brought
or
the
defendant
was
brought
to
trial
again
on
the
charge
and
he
claimed
double
jeopardy.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
see
how
a
defendant
can
have
more
double
jeopardy
protection
mr.
justice
white.
in
these
situations,
after
all
in
the
case
in
ball
itself
i
believe
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
preceding
the
next
to
that
point
because
that
to
us
is
the
critical
factor
in
this
case
that
differentiates
and
if
it
is
differentiated
at
all
from
ball.
but
that
does
not
have
to
do
with
a
post
verdict
--
i
thought
that
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
for
the
difference
between
a
arrest
of
judgment
and
an
appeal
leading
to
reversal
of
the
conviction
and
if
that
was
his
question,
we
see
no
difference.
of
course,
if
it
comes
before
a
verdict
then
you
will
find
mid-trial
then
you
will
have
the
problem
what
this
case
presents.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
i
want
to
make
one
point
about
ball
because
my
colleague's
response
to
ball
was
to
say
that
--
and
my
colleagues
response
to
the
problem
that
if
his
motion
had
been
denied,
he
could
have
been
tried
again
after
reversal
on
appeal
or
a
motion
on
arrest
of
judgment
was
to
say
that
he
made
it
before
trial;
it
should
have
been
granted
before
trial.
but
of
course
that
is
true
in
ball
and
that
is
true
in
most
of
this
cases
that
the
motion
is
made
before
trial,
the
district
court
erroneously
denies
the
motion
as
he
initially
did
at
the
outset
of
this
trial.
the
trial
proceeds,
the
defendant
is
subjected
to
the
trial
and
after
the
trial
is
over
and
he
is
convicted,
the
conviction
is
set
aside
because
of
the
defect
in
the
information.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
i
agree
it
could
have
been
amended.
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
dispositive
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
and
as
i
will
point
out
shortly,
if
the
defendant
wanted
to
avoid
going
through
a
second
trial,
he
could
have
suggested
an
amendment,
and
then
he
would
have
had
only
one
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
makes
the
two
complaints,
and
i
think
there
are
answers
to
both
of
them,
which
i
do
hope
that
i
will
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
not
think
we
are
not
asking
you
to
reexamine
jenkins.
we
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
in
this
case
because
we
think
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that
this
was
not
a
finding
on
the
merits
by
the
trial
court
in
the
defendant’s
favor
which
is
what
jenkins
suggest
may
not
be
reviewable.
this
was
clearly
a
termination
based
on
the
defect
in
the
institution
of
the
proceedings
and
in
no
way
going
to
the
merits,
there
were
no
findings
of
any
kind.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
a
necessity
for
further
proceedings
whenever
a
trial
is
terminated
prior
to
verdict.
this
is
a
pre-verdict
termination
case
which
jenkins
was
not.
and
this
is
a
case
like
giori
(ph),
and
somerville,
and
jorn,
and
then
the
whole
line.
we
think
there
is
no
material
difference.
nwo,
to
come
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
point,
this
case
focuses
on
the
difference
if
any
between
ball
and
cases
in
which
there
is
one
added
element
that
is
if
the
trial
was
terminated
prior
to
a
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence.
now,
that
fact,
the
pre-verdict
termination,
implicates
only
one
interest
other
than
those
already
considered
in
ball
that
is
protected
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
that
interest
is
the
valued
right
of
the
defendant
as
this
court
has
described
it,
to
receive
a
verdict
from
the
fact
finder
at
the
first
trial.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
a
defendant
who
has
searched
his
value
right
by
objection
to
a
termination
of
the
trial,
you
can
have
his
objection
overwritten
only
upon
the
showing
that
the
trial
court
reasonably
viewed
the
termination
as
manifestly
necessary.
in
giori,
in
downum,
in
somerville,
the
defendants
asserted
their
desire
to
go
to
verdict
by
objecting
to
the
mid-trial
termination.
this
court
was
then
confronted
with
the
difficult
question
in
each
of
those
cases
whether
the
ends
of
public
justice
sufficiently
supported
the
decision
of
the
trial
judge
to
deny
the
defendant,
the
opportunity
to
submit
his
case
to
the
jury
of
that
trial
and
possibly
to
terminate
the
controversy
then
and
there
by
means
of
an
acquittal.
jorn
was
a
similar
case
because
in
effect
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
any
opportunity
to
register
its
objections
for
the
termination.
but
in
this
case,
petitioner
never
disclosed
the
slightest
interest
in
obtaining
a
formal
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
from
the
judge
at
the
first
trial
understandably
enough
in
our
view.
nor
when
he
made
his
belated
motion
for
dismissal
following
the
prosecutor’s
opening
statement
and
it
was
tentatively
denied
subject
to
later
reconsideration
that
petitioner
expressed
any
objection
to
proceeding
with
the
trial.
now
here
in
urging
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
barred
a
second
trial,
petitioner
expresses
two
grievances
that
he
says
justify
the
result
he
seeks:
the
first
arises
from
the
fact
that
although
the
challenge
to
the
information
came
after
commencement
of
the
trial,
jeopardy
had
not
yet
attached
thus
petitioner
argues.
he
was
forced
to
undergo
a
trial
that
was
doomed
from
the
start
because
of
the
defect
and
in
the
information.
in
his
view,
this
procedure
necessitated
his
undergoing
two
trials
when
the
first
of
this
was
avoidable.
this
argument
parenthetically
is
virtually
the
exact
opposite
of
the
argument
of
the
defendant
in
illinois
v.
somerville
who
insisted
that
his
first
trial
was
hardly
pointless
even
though
it
could
not
have
lead
to
a
valid
conviction
in
view
of
the
possibility
of
a
valid
and
binding
acquittal.
petitioner’s
second
complaint
is
that
having
been
forced
to
undergo
a
trial
on
the
defective
information,
he
was
then
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence.
there
are
two
fatal
flaws
in
his
argument:
the
first
is
that
the
situation
here
was
largely
his
fault,
because
of
the
tardiness
of
his
challenge
to
the
information
--
and
i
do
not
mean
tardiness
in
the
sense
of
non-compliance
with
rule
12,
but
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
in
the
sense
of
the
situation
that
was
created.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would
make
no
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
view
of
our
alternative
and
principal
argument,
it
would
make
no
difference.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
unless
the
court
rejects
our
principal
argument.
i
mean,
we
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
win
the
case
that
there
is
this
added
factor,
but
some
people
may.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
the
second
point
and
the
one
that
is
more
crucial
in
our
view
is
that
petitioner
never
objected
to
having
the
trial
go
forward
nor
do
its
termination
by
grant
of
his
dismissal
motion
prior
to
a
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence.
petitioner
seeks
to
excuse
his
silence
by
contending
that
the
burden
rest
on
the
court
or
the
prosecutor
to
prevent
the
evils
to
which
he
now
says,
“he
will
subject
it.”
this
position
might
have
merit
if
it
could
fairly
be
said
that
no
defendant
would
ever
wish
to
be
placed
on
trial
on
the
defective
indictment
or
that
trial
having
commenced.
every
defendant
would
wish
to
proceed
to
verdict.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
was
not
a
pre-verdict
termination
in
jenkins.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
not
think
this
fits,
that
is
the
judge
thought
that
he
was
completing
the
trial
and
that
he
was
making
a
finding
on
whether
mr.
jenkins
had
committed
the
offense
or
not.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
although
the
government
contended
in
jenkins
that,
that
finding
was
based
on
an
erroneous
view
of
the
law,
nevertheless,
he
did
something
which
was
quite
similar
to
what
the
judge
did
in
martin
linen,
and
that
is
he
determined
that
as
he
understood
the
law.
mr.
jenkins
had
not
committed
an
offense.
now
the
government
came
along
and
said
well,
it
does
not
matter
we
can
appeal
because
he
has
made
all
the
findings
of
fact
that
are
necessary
to
support
a
judgment
of
conviction,
and
the
court
said,
"no,
it
is
true
he
made
most
of
them,
but
there
is
one
missing
which
is
critical
to
the
case."
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
do
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
he
said
that
i
think
he
is
guilty
as
being
a
verdict.
so
that
i
think
that
is
atmosphere
(ph)
to
the
case,
but
in
effect
what
judge
ashba
(ph)
clearly
did
was
to
stop
the
trial
before
it
had
reach
its
completion
and
to
grant
a
dismissal
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
before
determination
had
been
made
whether
the
petitioner
had
robbed
a
news
dealer
or
not.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
sure.
i
do
not
know
that
judge
travia
could
have
done
what
he
did
in
the
middle
of
the
trial.
i
mean
if
he
had
stopped
the
trial
before
the
prosecution
had
completed
its
evidence
and
that
the
defedants
were
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
are
getting
into
labels
in
effect,
he
may
--
he
called
what
he
did
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment,
but
in
fact
what
he
did
was
not
to
determine
the
facial
validity
of
the
indictment
in
any
sense
but
to
determine
that
the
defendant
was
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
do
not
--
i
know
that
you
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
jenkins
and
i
know
that
there
may
be
some
advantages,
but
i
understand
that
court’s
decisions
and
i
think
it
was
stated
in
serfass
and
it
was
stated
in
jorn
and
it
has
been
stated
several
places
in
this
court’s
jurisprudence
that
it
is
not
the
label
that
is
attached,
but
the
functional
announces
of
what
it
is
that
the
judge
in
fact
did,
and
that
was
the
case
in
martin
linen
most
recently
earlier
this
month.
the
court’s
opinion
said
we
look
at
what
the
judge
did.
the
action
was
in
fact
an
acquittal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
our
feeling
is
that
in
the
case
where
the
court
makes
a
determination
on
the
merits
we
have
a
different
problem.
i
mean
i
would
like
to
reargue
jenkins
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
timely
this
morning.
i
think
there
is
a
material
distinction
between
the
case
in
which
the
judge
whatever
he
calls
it
makes
a
determination
that
the
defendant
is
not
guilty
of
the
offense.
and
the
case
in
which
prior
to
verdict,
he
determines
that
there
is
a
facial
defect
in
the
indictment.
now,
if
i
can
come
back
to
the
petitioner's
two
complaints.
i
would
venture
to
say
that
most
defendants
would
be
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
having
a
first
trial
that
could
result
in
a
valid
acquittal
but
not
a
valid
conviction.
and
at
which
they
would
be
given
a
complete
preview
of
the
prosecution’s
case.
of
course,
not
all
of
them
would
necessarily,
but
i
think
some
of
them
would.
moreover
it
seems
likely
that
many
defendants
and
petitioner’s
position
of
the
conclusion
of
trial
having
heard
the
judge’s
tentative
assessment
of
the
evidence
would
prefer
not
to
have
a
formal
finding
of
guilt
entered.
in
other
words,
many
defendants
would
consider
that
what
happened
at
petitioner’s
trial
gave
them
the
best
of
both
worlds.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
different
defendants
will
have
different
desires,
and
there
is
only
one
way
that
we
can
know
what
a
particular
defendant’s
desires
are
in
a
particular
situation
and
that
is
if
he
tells
us.
if
he
makes
no
objection,
it
can
reasonably
be
assumed
that
the
course
adapted
is
not
objectionable
to
him.
he
should
not
later
be
heard
to
say
that
he
retroactively
objects
to
the
course
that
was
pursued
when
such
an
objection
conveniently
immunizes
him
from
any
exposure
to
conviction
and
punishment
for
his
crime.
to
sum
up,
the
position
we
urge
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
a
second
trial
in
the
following
circumstances:
first,
when
the
first
trial
is
ended
in
a
valid
judgment
of
conviction;
second
one,
the
first
trial
is
resulted
in
an
acquittal
by
the
finder
of
fact;
third,
when
the
first
trial
has
been
terminated
prior
to
verdict
as
it
was
here
provided
the
defendant
has
objected
to
the
pre-verdict
termination
or
been
deprived
of
any
opportunity
to
object
and
the
termination
was
not
manifestly
necessary.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
instances
in
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
bar.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
that
would
require
an
objection
on
his
bar.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
fourth,
when
the
defendant
has
been
forced
to
seek
a
termination
of
the
first
trial
in
account
of
irreparable
judicial
or
prosecutorial
overreaching
design
to
obstruct
the
rendition
of
a
fair
verdict
of
that
trial.
in
other
cases
a
second
trial
generally
is
not
barred
by
the
clause
in
our
view
and
particularly
pertinent
here,
a
second
trial
would
not
be
barred
when
the
defendant
has
sought
or
agreed
to
a
pre-verdict
termination
rather
than
asserting
his
valued
right
to
receive
the
verdict
of
the
fact
finder
than
hearing
the
case.
this
general
approach
has,
we
submit,
several
substantial
virtues
and
few
of
any
drawbacks.
it
is
simple
to
administer
and
it
provides
a
clear
rule
of
decision
for
the
vast
majority
of
cases
or
pre-verdict
termination.
the
court
must
ask
the
question
which
will
dispose
of
most
of
these
cases,
did
the
defendant
object
to
the
termination?
if
he
did
not
object
to
the
termination,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
not
bar
retrial.
only
if
he
did
object
to
the
termination
must
the
court
go
on
to
the
more
difficult
question
of
whether
there
was
in
a
particular
circumstances
manifest
necessity.
now,
i
stress
upon
the
defendant’s
role
in
causing
or
accepting
the
pre-verdict
termination
of
this
first
trial
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
the
prosecutor
asked,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
follow
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
does
not
object,
we
would
apply
that
rule,
yes.
if
he
does
object
then
we
have
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
contrary
to
jorn
because
in
jorn,
there
were
two
factors
that
were
critical.
the
one
that
is
most
pertinent
here
is
that
judge
reeder
simply
stopped
the
trial
and
discharged
the
jury
before
anybody
had
a
chance
to
say
anything.
now,
in
those
circumstances
i
do
not
think
we
can
assume
that
the
defendant
(inaudible)
agreed,
wanted
the
trial
to
stop.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
fairly
unique.
fortunately,
judges
do
not
often
act
with
that
degree
of
abruptness.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
both
factors
are
pertinent.
he
could
have
protected
himself
if
he
made
the
motion
as
he
did
here
and
the
district
court
tentatively
denied
its
subject
to
reconsideration,
and
then
the
district
court
after
taking
of
the
evidence
in
the
recess
returns
and
says,
"i
am
sorry
to
see
that
this
information
is
lawfully
deficient
under
indiana
law
and
i
am
going
to
have
to
dismiss
it."
the
defendant
could
say,
"your
honor,
i
do
not
want
my
motion
acted
upon
at
this
time,
i
will
make
it
an
arrest
of
judgment
if
you
find
me
guilty.
i
want
a
finding
of
guilty
or
innocence.
i
have
been
through
this
trial
and
i
want
a
verdict
in
this
trial."
and
if
the
defendant
did
that
and
the
judge
said,
"well,
i
am
sorry,
i
cannot
be
bothered"
or
so
on
then
i
think
unlike
somerville
--
and
we
have
suggested
this
on
our
brief
--
there
would
not
be
manifest
necessity
for
the
termination,
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
bar
a
second
trial.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
somerville
is
that
in
somerville
it
happened
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
and
the
interest
of
public
justice
weighed
very
differently
because
the
witnesses,
the
jury
and
everybody
and
the
defendant
and
all
the
parties
were
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
lengthy
proceeding.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
not
what
he
did
that
we
think
is
significant,
but
what
he
did
not
do.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
could
file
his
motion
at
any
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
would
be
no
bar
to
retrial
on
those
circumstances
in
our
view.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
would
be
a
question
if
the
defendant
said
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
they
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
normally
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
what
we
rely
on
here
is
the
fact
that
he
did
nothing.
he
complains
now
that
he
did
not
get
a
verdict,
but
he
did
not
ask
for
a
verdict.
he
was
perfectly
pleased
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
and
he
certainly
accepted
the
judge’s
grant
of
his
motion
to
dismiss
the
information.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
as
i
have
said
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
contention
is
that
it
was
still
an
opening
question
whether
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
not
a
question
of
finding
him
guilty;
it
is
the
question
of
finding
him
either
guilty
or
not
guilty.
what
is
critical
in
these
cases
is
the
possibility
that
the
defendant
will
be
acquitted.
that
was
what
all
the
argument
back
and
forth
was
in
somerville
and
in
your
dissent
mr.
justice
marshall
and
in
mr.
justice
white’s
dissent,
the
stress
was
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
might
have
had
a
valid
acquittal
of
that
trial,
and
he
wanted
that
chance
to
have
that
and
that
was
taken
away
from
him.
well,
in
this
case,
he
might
have
had
a
valid
acquittal
and
he
asked
the
judge
to
rule
and
make
a
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
he
did
not;
he
did
not
want
it.
nothing
was
taken
away
from
him
in
terms
of
the
valued
right
which
is
at
the
core
in
our
view
of
the
proper
disposition
of
this
pre-verdict
termination
cases.
so,
for
those
reasons
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
