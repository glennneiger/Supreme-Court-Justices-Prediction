chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
76-5187,
lee
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
bauer,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
government
have
any
advance
notice
that
this
motion
would
be
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
prosecution
counsel
was
hardly
in
a
better
position
to
have
this
--
take
one
of
these
alternatives
that
you
have
suggested
and
of
course
have
to
decide
this
issue
suddenly
presented,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can
accept
that
without
any
difficulty,
but
you
are
suggesting
that
this
was
so
clear
that
everyone
should
have
been
able
to
react
right
away.
if
it
were
so
clear
then
why
in
seven
week’s
time
since
counsel
had
been
appointed
had
he
not
made
his
motion
before
trial
so
as
to
give
the
government
and
the
court
reasonable
opportunity
to
analyze
the
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
defendant’s
counsel
in
court
at
that
time
as
an
officer
of
the
court
as
he
is,
as
you
are,
had
an
obligation
to
suggest
to
the
court
the
possibility
that
delay
in
acting
on
that
while
he
proceeded
to
take
testimony
might
create
some
serious
problems
in
the
administration
of
justice?
i
think
had
he
recognized
the
full
double
jeopardy
implications
at
that
time
perhaps
he
might.
trial
counsel
was
a
young,
inexperienced
man,
had
been
admitted
to
the
bar
for
less
than
a
year,
again
that
does
not
excuse
him.
but
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
having
been
appointed
as
the
second
counsel
to
petitioner,
one
of
the
things
that
might
naturally
have
happened
upon
his
appointment
under
the
criminal
justice
act,
was
that
he
would
have
initially
commenced
doing
research
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
interview
defendant,
interview
potential
witnesses,
and
although
it
is
clearly
not
the
best
trial
strategy,
it
might
well
be
a
reasonable
thing
not
to
look
at
the
language,
the
text
of
the
information
immediately
perhaps
not
even
look
at
the
information
until
the
day
of
trial.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
is
the
best
strategy
but
i
am
suggesting
that
that
was
a
reasonable
course
in
the
circumstances
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
so
egregious,
why
did
it
take
defense
counsel
seven
weeks
before
he
noticed
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
perhaps
then
you
were
mistaken,
when
you
say
it
is
so
egregious.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
are
correct
in
your
position,
perhaps
the
criminal
rule
should
be
amended
to
provide
that
any
motion
not
made
at
least
to
three
days
before
trial
is
waived,
the
defect
is
waived.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
only
a
coincidence
that
this
was
a
bench
trial.
suppose
the
jury
had
been
impaneled
and
sworn
and
then
this
motion
had
been
made,
what
would
the
situation
be
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
simple
jeopardy
would
have
attached.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
would
a
recess
be
after
jeopardy
had
attached?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
should
have
said
impaneled
and
sworn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
that
i
am
clarified
with
this
point,
but
since
defense
counsel
was
a
member
of
the
bar
and
an
officer
of
the
court,
i
am
not
sure
what
your
answer
was
when
i
asked,
did
he
have
an
obligation
as
an
officer
of
the
court
to
alert
the
judge
to
the
consequences
that
you
now
argued
for
namely,
that
there
would
be
a
double
jeopardy
before
the
judge
went
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
mean
this
is
something
he
discovered
by
research
after
the
event
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
top
of
the
nine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
76-5187,
lee
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
