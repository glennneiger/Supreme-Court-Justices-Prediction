justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bauer,
would
your
case
be
different
if
judge
ashba
(ph)
had
made
findings
effect
of
guilt
and
then
dismiss
the
indictment
after
that?
or
have
waited
for
a
post
verdict
ruling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
us
take
to
double
jeopardy
for
the
moment.
if
you
say
that
there
could
have
been
a
retrial,
i
suppose
you
also
then
would
acknowledge
that
if
there
had
been
a
post
trial
dismissal
on
this
ground;
it
could
have
been
appealed
by
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
have
been
appealed
by
the
government
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
if
the
ruling
was
affirmed,
there
could
be
another
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
say
judge
ashba
(ph)
had
post-verdict,
had
dismissed
that
preceding.
the
government
had
appealed
saying
the
areas
are
not
that
clear
at
all.
we
think
that
the
indictment
was
sufficient
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
the
dismissal.
the
government
could
still
re-indict,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
could
be
another
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
even
though
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
second
trial
raising
all
the
fact
questions,
double
jeopardy
would
not
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
error
you
really
are
complaining
of
then
was
ground
the
fact
that
judge
ashba
(ph)
did
not
make
the
right
findings.
he
did
not
allow
closing
argument
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
rest
entirely
on
the
error
being
so
plain.
lots
of
times,
a
motion
like
this
can
raise
a
rather
complicated
question
that
the
judge
either
has
to
adjourn
the
trial
or
go
ahead
subject
to
ruling
later.
would
you
have
a
ruling
that
when
every
such
a
motion
is
made
as
trial
commences,
the
judge
has
an
absolute
duty
to
postpone
the
taking
of
evidence
that
they
can
rule
on
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
with
the
notion
that
the
constitution
of
double
jeopardy
issue
turns
on
the
time
and
the
difficulty
of
the
making
of
the
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is
easy
to
say
that
after
the
fact,
but
the
trial
judges
who
have
to
go
ahead
with
trials
you
know,
it
is
not
that
easy.
i
do
not
think
any
motion
is
that
easy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
one
reason
defense
counsel
might
not
have
pursued
it
too
vigorously
was
that
he
would
not
gain
very
much
if
he
would
be
gotten
any
indictment
amended
right
there
in
the
spot,
what
does
he
gain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
under
your
view
of
the
law,
that
is
true
anyway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
other
observation,
going
back
to
the
posture
of
defense
counsel
the
commencement
of
the
--
right
before
evidence
was
taken,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
he
did
gave
him
two
bites
of
the
apple,
because
he
just
sits
there
with
error
in
the
record
and
there
is
a
verdict
against
him,
he
knows
he
could
have
it
set
aside.
but
if
he
does
not
have
any
amendment
made,
he
just
lets
the
case
go
to
verdict,
he
wins.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey
isn't
his
argument
sort
of
in
the
alternative,
that
if
you
regard
the
motion
as
timely
and
it
is
before
jeopardy
is
attached
then
the
judge
had
a
duty
to
rule
on
it
then,
but
if
the
judge
decides
to
wait
until
the
trial
gets
started
then
he
has
a
right
to
a
verdict
by
the
first
trial
effect?
he
can
have
to
deal
with
the
two
things
separately.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
get
a
chance
to
make
it,
and
when
you
do
with
respect
to
the
second
branch
of
the
argument,
i
would
like
to
know
whether
the
government
is
at
all
asking
us
to
reexamine
the
jenkins
case,
because
that
seems
to
me
that
is
your
toughest
hurdle
is
the
language
of
the
under
jenkins.
i
think
jenkins
is
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
it
was
not
reviewable
in
jenkins
was
because
of
the
necessity
of
further
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
facts.
would
you
still
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
can
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
why
is
not
that
same
argument
applicable
to
jenkins
because
there
the
defendant
did
not
object
to
the
dismissal
or
discharge
at
the
time
the
judge
made
it
without
all
the
necessary
findings
had
been
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
the
issue
was
whether
it
was
because
the
court
held
as
i
read
the
courtâ€™s
opinion
that
the
reason
it
was
not
appealable
was
there
were
some
more
factual
determinations
necessary
and
why
is
not
that
just
exactly
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
not
that
like
what
judge
ashba
(ph)
did?
he
said,
"i
think
this
fellow
is
guilty
but
i
wanted
to
affirm
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
completion
in
what
sense?
i
mean
all
the
evidence
was
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
petitioner
is
guilty,
which
is
exactly
what
was
left
out
in
jenkins,
isn't
it,
the
factual
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey
can
i
ask
one
other
question?
the
fatal
defect
one
of
the
critical
point
is
the
defendant
did
not
object
to
the
pre-verdict
termination.
now,
in
stating
that,
are
you
emphasizing
the
fact
that
he
made
the
motion
or
are
you
emphasizing
the
fact
that
the
time
the
judge
rule,
after
all
the
evidence
was
in
he
did
not
in
effect
say
please
do
not
grant
my
motion?
