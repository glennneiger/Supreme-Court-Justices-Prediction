justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
joseph
bauer,
counsel
for
petitioner,
phillip
jerome
lee.
this
case
involves
issues
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
illinois
v.
somerville,
this
court
observed
that
virtually
all
double
jeopardy
cases
turn
on
the
particular
facts.
therefore,
i
would
like
to
begin
this
morning
with
a
brief
statement
of
the
facts,
because
that
is
essential
for
an
understanding
of
the
issues
presented
in
this
case.
in
december
1973,
a
theft
allegedly
occurred
in
the
united
states’
post
office.
a
few
weeks
later
in
1974,
a
federal
information
was
filed
charging
the
petitioner
with
that
theft.
petitioner
waived
his
right
to
trial
by
jury.
on
the
day
of
the
trial
and
prior
to
the
introduction
of
any
evidence,
counsel
for
petitioner
moved
to
dismiss
the
information
because
it
failed
to
allege
a
vital
portion
of
that
information,
that
is
that
theft
requires
that
the
act
be
committed
knowingly
and
with
an
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
use
of
the
property.
he
had
an
opportunity
to
make
such
a
motion
earlier
in
the
proceedings,
did
he
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
my
only
suggestion
is
that
an
attorney
who
makes
a
motion
that
late
in
the
game
may
well
find
a
trial
judge
unprepared
to
pass
on
it
at
the
particular
moment
that
he
makes
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
going
on?
wasn't
jury
selection
about
to
begin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
the
court
about
to
commence
the
hearing
of
testimony
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
purposes
of
your
argument
as
to
double
jeopardy,
do
you
draw
any
distinction
between
the
declarations
of
a
mistrial
on
the
dismissal
of
indictment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
here
and
clearly
it
was
not
a
dismissal
on
the
merits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
motion
to
dismiss
an
indictment
in
a
sense
always
an
objection
of
proceeding
with
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
motion
to
dismiss
an
indictment
before
the
trial
has
commenced.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
timing
of
his
motion
might
be
very
significant
and
yet
there
may
be
no
rule
that
requires
and
after
the
judge
says
i
will
pass
on
that
later
to
say
judge
i
want
you
to
pass
on
it
now.
it
would
take
a
fairly
bold
attorney
i
would
think
in
many
courts
to
suggest
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
defendant
never
has
it
within
his
own
power
to
stop
the
trial.
but
that
is
entirely
up
to
the
judge.
the
judge
can
just
say
i
will
reserve
ruling
on
all
that
stuff,
we
got
witnesses
waiting.
we
are
going
to
go
ahead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
an
arrest
of
judgment
should
be
tried
on
an
indictment
with
a
different
allegation,
would
you
not
just
the
same
way
you
would
be
on
an
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
jenkins
would
have
come
out
differently
if
judge
travia
had
done
what
he
did
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
rather
than
at
the
end?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
the
prosecution’s
evidence,
he
had
said
it
seems
to
me
from
the
second
circuit
cases
that
there
is
a
defense
on
the
merits
to
this
thing.
i
am
just
going
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
jenkins
and
wilson
are
both
written
in
terms
of
labels
and
in
terms
of
black
and
white
lines
rather
than
balancing
of
acuities,
it
seems
to
me,
and
there
is
an
advantage
and
a
disadvantage
to
doing
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
was
referring
to
jenkins
and
wilson.
