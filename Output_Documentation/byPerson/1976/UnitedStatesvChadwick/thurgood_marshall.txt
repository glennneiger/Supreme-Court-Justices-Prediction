baggage
accompanying
means
the
owners
of
the
baggage,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
checked
baggage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
got
that
from
reading
the
brief.
the
suitcases
were
not
checked
and
the
footlocker
was
by
the
owners
traveling
on
the
same
amtrak
train.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
was
not
a
question
of
sending
by
freight
a
container
from
one
point
to
another.
it
was
a
baggage
accompanying
the
travelers,
exactly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
after
the
loading
of
the
locker
into
the
trunk
of
the
car
did
the
officers
open
it
and
where?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
randolph,
you
keep
mentioning
they
opened
the
locker.
how
did
they
open
it,
did
they
break
those
locks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
some
information
at
some
point
in
the
record
that
they
picked
the
lock.
that
was
the
phrase
used.
in
other
words,
used
a
wire
or
a
screw
driver
or
something.
as
a
substitute
for
a
key.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
randolph,
how
can
it
be
readily
moved
if
it
was
in
the
fbi
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
was
the
fbi
office?
was
it
near
the
courthouse?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
the
courthouse.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
magistrate
in
the
courthouse?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
it
not
be
important
for
us
to
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
you
could
have
gotten
a
search
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
supports
the
original
seizure
of
the
footlocker.
there
was
an
automobile
and
that
the
seizure
of
the
footlocker
took
place
without
a
warrant
because
it
was
an
automobile
and
because
it
was
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
so
that
supports
the
seizure,
but
as
i
understand
that
the
issue
is
not
the
seizure
of
the
footlocker,
but
the
opening
and
the
search
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
brief
or
your
petition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
in
the
(inaudible),
obviously.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
not
quite
in
such
a
tautological
way,
i
guess?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
whether
or
not
we
require
them,
it
is
whether
or
not
the
constitution
requires
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
one
of
those
cases
was
the
material
in
the
fbi
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
in
their
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
concede,
do
you
not,
that
under
that
standard
that
you
had
just
quoted,
this
does
not
fall
within
any
of
the
exceptions
so
far
established?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
your
argument
that
this
case
is
governed
by
any
existing
exception
to
the
basic
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
say
that
this
opinion,
if
we
go
with
you,
applies
only
to
footlockers
and
does
not
apply
to
other
bags?
you
do
not
want
us
to
do
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
draper
case,
what
was
the
situation,
i
am
a
little
cloudy
on
that.
was
it
not
a
zippered
bag
like
a
briefcase
that
has
a
zipper
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
think
there
is
any
analogy
between
the
zippered
bag
in
draper
and
the
box
with
mr.
machado
sitting
on
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
too
heavy
to
move.
obviously,
they
moved
it,
maybe
too
heavy
to
move
for
one
ordinary
man?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
the
size
of
it
bear
on
the
right
to,
i
suppose
instead
of
lock
it
had
a
zipper
as
some
large
lockers
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
the
dog
had
identified
it,
they
concluded
there
was
probably
cause
as
the
courts
below
have
done
and
they
said,
“mr.
machado,
you
are
under
arrest,”
and
then
searched
it
right
then
and
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
they
could
search
it
at
the
depot,
but
not
after
they
got
back
to
the
fbi
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
would
not
argue
that
your
position
today,
if
sustained,
would
necessarily
overrule
a
case
authorizing
the
seizing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
they
not
have
picked
the
lock
at
the
depot
as
readily
as
they
could
at
the
fbi
office?
is
that
really
a
controlling
factor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
the
evidence
that
i
read
here
is
that
they
picked
it
with
means
other
than
the
key.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
difference
does
it
make
really
of
how
they
opened
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
robinson,
we
said
rather
clearly
that
whatever
the
reason
behind
the
allowance
of
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
the
government
did
not
have
to
show
in
every
individual
case
that
a
particular
reason
was
there,
that
it
was
lawful
just
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
was
incident
to
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
landburg,
your
real
problem,
is
it
not,
the
dog?
once
the
dog
scratched
that
trunk,
your
clients
were
gone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
should
have
said,
“i
wonder
whose
trunk
this
is.”
is
that
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
they
had
to
do
was
wait
until
the
next
morning
and
any
magistrate
in
the
world
on
the
basis
of
that
dog
would
have
granted
the
search
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
not
be
the
home
because
you
could
not
carry
the
home
into
the
fbi
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white
you
said
that
there
was
a
specific
court
of
appeals
case
i
believe.
justice
thurgood
marshall
relating
to
a
locked
briefcase,
would
you
identify
that
case
for
us
please?
