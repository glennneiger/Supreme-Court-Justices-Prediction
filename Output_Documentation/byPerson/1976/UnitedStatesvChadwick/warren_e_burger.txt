chief

warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-1721,
united
states
v.
chadwick.
mr.
randolph,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
it
was
transshipped,
that
is
it
came
from
somewhere
else
to
san
diego?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
san
diego
on
to
baltimore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
record
show
what
their
reaction
was
to
the
dogâ€™s
conduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
they
have
arrived?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
argument
of
your
friends
is
that
they
should
have
retained
possession
while
they
proceeded
to
go
and
get
a
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
your
friends
concede
that
if
the
footlocker
had
not
been
taken
while
the
respondents
were
sitting
on
it
around
the
time
when
the
dog
identified
it,
that
that
would
have
been
appropriate
without
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
got
some
impression
that
you
intermitted
that
they
concede
that.
they
said
that
is
when
it
should
have
been
seized,
that
was
perhaps
the
way
you
put
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
thought
that
this
footlocker
was
analogous
to
automobiles?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
certainly
this
court
has
not
upset
any
search
in
the
past
five
years
of
an
automobile
where
there
has
been
probable
cause,
has
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
footlocker
is
very
much
like
an
automobile,
it
does
not
have
any
motor
or
wheels?
in
other
words,
it
is
not
mobile?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
randolph,
mr.
weinberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
randolph,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have

judgment
and
opinion

the
court

announce

75-1721,

states

chadwick
and

reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
this
morning.

judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
