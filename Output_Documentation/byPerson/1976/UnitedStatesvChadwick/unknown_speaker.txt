unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
the
source
of
origin
of
the
shipment?
unknown
speaker
origin
or?
unknown
speaker
the
agents
were
still
sitting
on
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
counter
worded
issue
in
this
case
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
seize
the
footlocker?
unknown
speaker
i
wondered
if
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
if
that
is
counter
worded
issue.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
is
a
given
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
there
was
probable
cause
to
seize
the
footlocker.
unknown
speaker
that
is
my
understanding.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
issue
in
this
case
involves
the
opening
and
the
search
of
the
footlocker
and
not
the
seizure
of
the
footlocker,
am
i
correct?
unknown
speaker
the
footlocker
was
in
a
lawful
possession
or
custody
of
the
federal
agents
and
the
issue
involves
the
opening
and
search
of
it,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
for
a
long,
long
time,
plenty
of
time
to
get
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
is
it
important
that
the
locker
was
seized
incident
to
arrest,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
will
be
making
the
same
argument
i
take
it,
if
it
had
been
seized
in
somebody
else’s
possession.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
cases
that
you
know
of
or
what
is
the
established
rule
in
the
event
you
arrest
a
man
and
find
a
locked
small
box
in
his
pocket?
now,
you
can
search
him
incident
to
arrest,
i
think,
but
if
you
find
the
locked
box,
will
you
open
it?
are
there
some
cases
on
that?
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
sealed
envelope
in
his
pocket?
unknown
speaker
on
the
incident
to
arrest
theory?
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
in
his
possession
and
under
his
control?
unknown
speaker
in
his
pocket?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
know
any
cases
about
--
how
about
arresting
a
man
carrying
a
locked
briefcase?
how
about
that?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
a
sound
approach,
you
do
not
need
to
go
any
further
to
uphold
this
as
incident
to
arrest
search,
so
you,
simply
argue
on
the
basis
that
you
could
have
searched
it
when
you
arrested
them?
unknown
speaker
that
could
become
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy.
if
the
fbi
agents
opened
it
and
it
sustained,
presumably
the
next
people
have
no
expectation
of
privacy.
the
concept
of
privacy
must
mean
something
more
than
that?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
a
container
in
an
automobile,
this
one
is
out
and
in
the
custody
of
the
fbi?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
at
the
time
it
was
searched,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
randolph.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
as
great
with
respect
to
a
footlocker
as
it
might
be
with
respect
to,
say,
the
personal
suitcase
of
a
traveler?
unknown
speaker
if
your
case
would
be
different,
mr.
randolph,
if
the
footlocker
had
not
been
traveling
with
the
individual
who
was
arrested?
unknown
speaker
mr.
randolph,
i
just
want
to
get
one
thing
straight.
now,
you
cited
the
preston
case
and
mr.
justice
black’s
remarks
in
that
case.
does
preston
not
dispositively
against
you
on
the
question
whether
it
is
incident
to
an
arrest
because
they
have
invalidated
the
search?
unknown
speaker
well,
preston
certainly
does
not
help
you
though,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weinberg,
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
mr.
randolph.
you
say
the
reduced
expectations
of
privacy
are
not
present
after
cady
and
opperman.
well,
if
we
decide
this
case
against
you
and
the
next
case
against
your
counterpart,
presumably
there
will
be
reduced
expectations
of
privacy
in
footlockers.
that
is
kind
of
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy,
however
you
argue
it?
unknown
speaker
but
the
same
kind
of
argument
could
have
been
and
was
made
to
us
in
cady
and
opperman.
the
right
of
privacy,
protected
searches
of
automobiles
even
though
there
might
be
probable
cause,
if
you
did
not
have
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
fourth
amendment
were
appealed,
there
could
not
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
by
anybody
anywhere,
could
there?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent?
what
do
you
think
the
established
rule
is
in
the
lower
courts
or
maybe
here
otherwise
we
do
not
think
we
probably
settled
it,
about
closed
containers
in
the
possession
of
a
person
when
he
is
arrested?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
let
us
assume
there
is
no
question
about
immediate
control,
but
the
only
thing
is,
the
container
is
closed?
unknown
speaker
well,
here
the
briefcase
is
just
closed.
nobody
knows
whether
it
is
locked
or
not.
may
the
officer
look
in
the
briefcase
or
not,
is
there
some
established
rule
about
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know
what
you
would
argue,
but
what
about...
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
sealed
envelope?
are
there
some
cases
about
sealed
envelopes
found
on
somebody?
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
cases
on
it?
unknown
speaker
how
about
when
you
search
a
car
on
the
spot
when
there
has
been
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
some
seizable
material
in
the
car
and
you
open
a
locked
trunk
and
you
find
a
closed
container.
is
there
some
established
rule
about
that
closed
container?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
issue
we
have
here
is
rather
relevant
to
those
situations?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
if
the
rule
were
that
you
can
open
a
closed
container
found
in
the
possession
of
a
person
and
under
his
control
when
he
is
arrested,
if
the
rule
were
that
you
can
open
that,
would
that
govern
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
about
if
you
could
open
a
closed
container
found
in
a
trunk
of
a
car
and
the
car
was
otherwise
searchable,
would
that
cover
this
case?
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
truth
in
fact
to
it,
is
there
not?
in
coolidge,
search
of
an
automobile
was
upset
and
the
automobile
was
on
the
premises
of
the
owner.
subsequent
cases
have
sustained
not
really
distinguishable
searches
of
automobiles
where
they
were
in
public
ways.
someone
who
carries
a
sealed
envelop
on
a
3,000
mile
journey
is
probably
more
opt
to
have
things
happen
to
it
than
somebody
who
simply
leaves
it
in
a
drawer
at
home.
unknown
speaker
draper
holds
that,
does
it
not,
if
it
is
a
search
incident
to
arrest?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
the
government’s
theory
would
support
that
even
though
there
was
not
probably
cause
for
arrest?
unknown
speaker
mr.
weinberg,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
draper
case?
i
don
not
know
whether
you
have
conceded
or
not
that
that
holds
that,
incident
to
an
arrest,
it
was
appropriate
to
open
the
brown
zippered
bag.
the
actual
facts
of
that
case
were
that
the
heroin
was
in
the
man’s
left
hand
and
the
syringe
was
in
a
brown
zippered
bag
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
argument
about
whether
or
not
it
was
proper
to
open
the
brown
zippered
bag?
unknown
speaker
so
there
really
is
no
holding
on
the
point
that
is
before
us?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
footlocker
could
have
been
held
indefinitely
pending
the
attaining
of
a
warrant,
the
locker
having
been
seized,
pursuant
to
a
probable
cause?
unknown
speaker
you
had
no
problem
withholding
it
for
a
sufficient
period
of
time
to
obtain
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
the
question
really
addresses
whether
or
not
your
client
could
have
walked
away
with
the
footlocker,
under
your
submission
or
did
the
government
had
the
right
to
retain
the
footlocker?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
that
brings
you
back
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
comment,
does
it
not,
that
your
argument
really
would
not
really
help
your
client
very
much
in
this
case,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
the
only
misconduct
here
is
the
failure
of
the
government
to
have
obtained
a
warrant
and
you
concede
that
the
government
would
have
had
time
to
obtain
it
and
had
the
government
obtained
it
in
view
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
magistrate
certainly
would
have
issued
the
warrant.
unknown
speaker
assume
for
a
moment
that,
well,
you
need
not
assume
it,
the
fact
is
clear
that
upon
opening
this
locker
and
finding
that
the
substances
in
it
were
totally
innocent,
powdered
sugar,
talcum,
whatever.
these
gentlemen
could
have
been
on
their
way
within
an
hour
of
so,
could
they
not?
unknown
speaker
with
the
apologies
of
the
agents
and
perhaps
a
potential
case
against
them,
but
holding
it
until
they
could
find
a
magistrate
the
next
morning.
would
that
not
be
a
greater
intrusion
than
the
intrusion
of
opening
it
immediately?
unknown
speaker
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
the
contents
of
the
footlocker
were
marijuana,
heroin
or
a
small
tactical
atomic
bomb?
unknown
speaker
well,
mind
that
at
10:00
at
night
you
do
not
find
magistrates
or,
do
you
in
boston?
unknown
speaker
in
the
courthouse?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
cooper?
what
justified
the
search
of
the
automobile?
that
was
not
the
automobile
theory,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
based
on
the
idea
that
the
car
had
been
used.
they
had
probable
cause
where
either
car
had
been
used
to
transport
contraband?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
trunk
in
this
case
is
in
the
position
of
the
car
in
terms
of
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
forfeit
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know
and
then
i
am
just
asking
why
would
cooper
not
pick
up,
if
the
united
states
has
the
right
on
probable
cause
to
seize
the
footlocker
and
hold
it
pending
of
forfeiture
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
that
was
not
the
court’s
rationale
in
that
case,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
cooper.
unknown
speaker
so
the
copper,
opperman
approach
would
cover
anything,
not
just
cars,
it
would
cover
a
footlocker,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
are
holding
the
footlocker
pending
forfeiture
proceeding,
your
submission
is
nevertheless
that
you
may
not
search
it
without
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
prior
to
forfeiture,
pending
to
a
forfeiture
proceeding
you
still
say
that
the
government
needs
a
warrant
to
search
it?
unknown
speaker
so
again,
it
is
a
difference
between
the
car
and
footlocker?
unknown
speaker
if
this
footlocker
had
been
held,
mr.
weinberg
subject
to
a
forfeiture
proceeding
as
the
vehicle
or
container
of
contraband
would
it
be
necessary
to
open
it
before
the
forfeiture
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
why,
why
could
not
the
government
not
go
into
the
courts
and
simply
say
here,
we
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
contraband
in
here
and
then
and
there
could
not
the
judge
say
alright,
we
will
have
to
open
it
to
find
out.
now,
would
that
be
a
“judicial
warrant”?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
concede
that
the
court
could
say,
having
brought
it
into
the
courtroom
as
you
would
not
trouble
to
do
with
the
automobile,
alright,
now
we
will
now
have
the
marshall
of
the
court
open
it
up
and
have
someone
decide
whether
it
is
contraband?
unknown
speaker
on
what
subject?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
has
been
conceded
now
that
there
is
probable
cause
at
this
stage.
unknown
speaker
that
footlocker
then
is
in
the
courtroom
in
the
forfeiture
proceeding.
could
the
court
direct
it
to
be
opened
to
determine
whether
there
were
machine
guns
or
whatever
inside
of
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
lawful?
unknown
speaker
mr.
weinberg,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
if
there
were
a
provision
in
the
icc
that
permitted
the
carrier
to
open
materials
such
as
this
in
its
custody
for
inspection
at
its
discretion?
unknown
speaker
right,
i
am
talking
about
expectation
of
privacy.
unknown
speaker
unanimous
like
one
court
or
incident?
unknown
speaker
does
any
of
it
have
a
footlocker
in
these
cases?
unknown
speaker
did
they
do
that
on
the
automobile?
what
about
on
the
searching
closed
containers
in
possession
when
you
are
arrested,
is
that
strictly
on
the
incident
to
arrest
basis?
unknown
speaker
but
no
court,
i
take
it,
has
embraced
your
luggage
exception?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume,
do
you
know
of
any
court
that
has
embraced
this
notion
that
the
government
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
certain
briefcase
checked
in
a
hotel
has
got
contraband
in
it
and
the
checker
gives
the
government
the
briefcase?
there
they
have
it
and
let
us
assume
they
are
in
lawful
possession
of
it.
may
anybody
justify
opening
it
without
a
warrant?
do
you
know
any
cases
like
that?
unknown
speaker
how
about
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
theory?
the
government
would
like
to
be
able
to
search
any
effects
that
are
found
outside
the
home,
if
they
have
got
probable
cause
to
search
it?
unknown
speaker
yes
and
i
think
that
the
contrary
rule.
unknown
speaker
in
the
government’s
possession,
the
contrary
rule
that
respondents
urge
has
a
delusive
exactness
to
it.
it
sounds
very
precise,
just
notable
perceptions,
but
then
when
you
start
thinking
about
it,
he
makes
a
distinction
between
whether
the
footlocker
was
weighed
2
pounds
or
20
pounds,
or
even
if
mr.
machado
was
a
defensive
lineman
for
a
pro
football
team
and
had
it
under
his
arm
as
he
walked
out,
it
would
make
a
difference.
it
would
make
a
difference
if
the
car
were
pulling
away.
the
first
circuit
has
said
that
makes
a
difference,
if
the
car
were
pulling
away,
then
you
can
open
up
the
closed
container.
these
kinds
of
fine-line
distinctions,
we
think
do
a
couple
things.
one,
they
lead
to
a
lot
of
litigation.
second,
they
do
not
give
the
police
any
real
guidance
because
they
are
not
analytical.
i
cannot
see
the
line
between
those
events
and
i
think
the
court
would
have
difficulty
doing
so
as
well.
we
think
not
only
that,
but
finally,
maybe
this
is
the
most
important
thing,
they
take
away
the
importance
and
the
seriousness
of
the
warrant
requirement
because
they
burden
the
warrant
system
with
these
kinds
of
cases
and
i
think
that
may
not
help
to
instill
the
kind
of
responsibility
that
we
want
to
instill
in
magistrates,
when
they
are
dealing
with
very
serious
intrusions
where
the
court
has
held
a
warrant
is
required
in
the
home,
in
the
office,
and
private
communications.
for
that
reason,
we
urge
the
decision
of
the
court
to
be
reversed.
