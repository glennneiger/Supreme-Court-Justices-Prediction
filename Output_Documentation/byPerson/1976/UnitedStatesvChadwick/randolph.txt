mr.
randolph
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
a
search
warrant
is
required
before
federal
agents
may
open
a
locked
trunk
of
footlocker
that
they
properly
seized
and
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
it
contained
contraband.
the
district
court
suppressed
the
200
pounds
of
marijuana
found
inside
the
trunk.
on
the
government’s
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
with
one
judge
dissenting.
the
relevant
facts
are
these:
on
may
8
about
four
years
ago,
may
8,
1973,
amtrack
officials
told
federal
agents
in
san
diego
that
defendants,
machado
and
leary,
had
loaded
a
trunk
on
a
train
bound
for
boston.
they
believe
the
trunk
contained
marijuana
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
was
leaking
talcum
powder
which
is
often
used
to
cover
the
odor
of
marijuana.
the
trunk
had
an
unusual
weight
for
its
size
and
machado’s
description
tallied
with
a
profile
used
by
the
railroad
to
spot
drug
traffickers.
the
federal
agents
relayed
this
information
to
their
counterparts
in
boston.
i
should
describe
the
footlocker.
it
was
described
in
the
record
as
old
and
brown.
according
to
ms.
leary’s
suppression
motion,
it
was
2’11”
wide,
1’9”
high,
and
1’8”
deep.
mr.
randolph
it
was
san
diego.
mr.
randolph
it
was
shipped
from
san
diego
to
boston
on
an
amtrak
train.
the
latch
was
locked
and
there
was
a
padlock
on
it.
mr.
randolph
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
randolph
there
is
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
latch
was
locked.
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
there
were
two
suitcases
and
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
we
do
not
think
the
suitcases
are
relevant.
we
had
not
brought
an
issue
to
the
court
that
concerns
it.
mr.
randolph
the
footlocker
traveled
across
the
country
in
a
baggage
compartment.
the
machado
and
leary
traveled
across
the
country
in
the
passenger
compartment
on
the
same
train.
the
footlocker,
as
i
have
said,
was
locked.
it
had
a
padlock
over
it
and
the
latch
on
it
was
locked
as
well.
mr.
randolph
it
accompanied
the
travelers.
on
the
evening
of
may
10,
two
days
later,
the
train
arrived
at
boston
south
station.
federal
agents
were
there
to
greet
it.
within
the
next
15-20
minutes,
the
following
events
occurred.
it
was
8:50
p.m.
in
the
evening.
the
agent
saw
machado
and
leary
leave
the
train,
claim
the
trunk,
move
it
against
the
wall,
and
sit
down
on
it.
machado
left
to
make
a
telephone
call
and
returned.
the
agents
had
a
dog
with
them
trained
to
recognize
the
smell
of
controlled
substances.
the
dog
went
to
the
footlocker
and
started
scratching
on
it,
which
is
considered
an
alert
to
the
presence
of
such
substances.
mr.
randolph
well,
ms.
leary
and
mr.
machado
were
sitting
on
the
footlocker.
the
dog
approached
it
and
started
scratching.
mr.
randolph
what
the
record
does
show
is
that
a
car
pulled
up
outside
the
train
station
quite
quickly
thereafter.
in
the
car
was
mr.
chadwick,
he
opened
the
trunk
of
the
car.
he
went
into
the
train
station,
talked
very
quickly
with
mr.
machado
and
ms.
leary,
went
outside
and
proceeded
to
open
the
trunk
of
the
car.
with
the
help
of
a
porter
then,
ms.
leary
and
mr.
machado
accompanying
the
footlocker
took
it
outside
of
the
train
station
to
mr.
chadwick’s
waiting
car.
defendant
leary
sat
down
in
the
car
while
mr.
chadwick,
mr.
machado
and
the
porter
lifted
the
footlocker
into
the
car’s
trunk.
when
the
porter
left,
the
agents
moved
in.
all
three
defendants
were
arrested.
the
footlocker
was
seized
from
the
open
trunk
of
the
car.
it
is
now
9:10
p.m.
the
agents
testified
that
they
decided
not
to
open
the
footlocker
on
the
spot
for
a
number
of
reasons.
number
one,
it
was
dark
outside.
the
area
was
dimly
lit.
many
pedestrians
were
passing
by
and
there
was
heavy
automobile
traffic
on
the
street.
the
three
defendants
and
the
footlocker
were
taken
to
the
agents’
office
in
boston
about
five
minutes
away
from
the
train
station.
the
footlocker
was
still
leaking
talcum
powder.
at
the
office,
in
the
presence
of
the
three
defendants,
the
agents
opened
the
footlocker.
inside,
as
i
have
said
before,
they
found
200
pounds
of
marijuana.
according
to
ms.
leary’s
suppression
motion,
what
they
actually
found
were
85
packages
each
wrapped
in
blue
paper
and
sealed
with
a
piece
of
tape
and
those
85
packages
tallied
to
200
pounds
of
marijuana.
the
next
morning,
this
is
not
in
the
appendix
that
the
court
has,
the
next
morning
the
defendants,
all
three
of
them
were
arraigned
before
a
magistrate
on
a
complaint
and
an
affidavit
of
the
arresting
agent.
bail
was
set,
they
were
bound
over
and
later
there
was
an
indictment.
the
government
in
this
case,
wants
to
introduce
that
marijuana
and
indeed
the
footlocker
itself
into
evidence
at
defendants’
trial.
the
defendants
opposed
this.
they
opposed
the
introduction
of
the
marijuana
on
the
basis
that
the
agents
should
not
have
opened
the
footlocker
without
first
getting
a
search
warrant.
our
brief
advances
a
number
of
reasons
why
we
think
the
opening
of
the
footlocker
without
a
warrant
was
not
an
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
as
a
preliminary
matter,
i
ought
to
say
that
our
purpose
in
advancing
these
arguments
is
to
try
to
provide
a
coherent
analysis
to
guide
the
decision
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
court
will
notice
from
my
brief,
have
dealt
with
this
type
of
situation.
moveable
objects
found
outside
the
home
in
countless
cases,
the
results,
we
think
generally
support
the
government’s
position
in
this
case,
although
the
rationale
is
sometimes
difficult
to
discern,
i
might
point
out
that,
in
fact
respondents
in
their
brief
not
sited
a
single
lower
court
decision
in
their
favor.
mr.
randolph
the
loading
took
place
at
9:10
which
is
the
time
the
arrest
took
place.
the
footlocker
was
searched,
the
testimony
is,
shortly
after
9:30
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
randolph
after
they
have
arrived
at
the
office
of
the
federal
agents
in
boston,
five
minutes
away
form
the
train
station.
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
i
might
point
out
that
the
factual
patterns
in
all
these
cases
are
endless
of
course
and
to
make
our
position
clear,
in
this
case
alone,
for
example,
after
the
agents
had
probable
cause,
mr.
machado,
for
instance,
could
have
been
arrested
and
the
footlocker
seized
while
he
was
sitting
on
it
in
the
train
station
or
while
he
was
moving
it
out
to
the
car
or
while
mr.
chadwick’s
car
was
pulling
away
with
the
footlocker
in
the
trunk.
under
our
view
of
the
case,
the
search
without
a
warrant
in
all
these
situations
would
be
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
not
unreasonable
and
so
we
draw
on
distinction
between
this.
we
do
not
think
they
are
constitutional
distinctions
and
let
me
explain
why.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
strictly
a
search
and
seizure
case.
the
sequence
is
reversed.
it
is
a
seizure
and
search
situation.
like
the
cases
dealing
with
automobiles
and
unlike
the
cases
dealing
with
hounds
or
houses,
the
seizure
came
first
here.
we
think
it
was
a
lawful
seizure
and
we
do
not
think
there
could
be
any
doubt
whatever
that
the
agents
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
footlocker
was
loaded
with
contraband.
mr.
randolph
yes,
in
the
suppression
motion
filed
by
mr.
chadwick
and
joined
by
mr.
machado,
they
sought
not
only
to
suppress
the
contents
of
the
footlocker,
but
also
the
footlocker
itself.
mr.
randolph
well,
they
did
not
cross-petition
and
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
there
was
probable
cause.
mr.
randolph
it
is
a
given.
mr.
randolph
it
is
a
given
as
the
case
is
presented
to
court.
mr.
randolph
in
fact,
the
conclusion
of
the
probable
clause
to
seize
the
footlocker
obviously
was
the
very
reason
for,
for
example,
mr.
machado’s
arrest,
the
two
are
intertwined.
we
think,
it
is
clear
as
can
be,
that
the
agents
did
not
need
the
authority
of
warrant
to
take
that
footlocker
into
their
possession
and
the
reason
is
the
same
as
in
the
automobile
cases.
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
footlocker
was
evidence,
in
obvious
view
it
was
movable
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
its
movability.
the
footlocker
had
just
traversed
the
entire
continent,
you
will
recall
and
it
appears
that
it
still
has
not
reached
its
final
destination.
once
that
footlocker
was
in
the
agent’s
lawful
possession,
our
position
is
that
they
did
not
have
to
treat
it
like
a
child
treats
a
christmas
package
on
christmas
eve,
shake
it
and
everything,
but
they
could
not
open
it.
we
believe
they
could
open
it.
we
believe
they
could
open
it
on
the
spot
or
we
believe
that
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
open
it
back
at
the
station
house
or
at
the
office,
as
occurred
in
this
case.
it
is
at
this
point
in
the
events
that
the
respondents
in
this
case
invoked
the
warrant
requirement.
mr.
randolph
i
do
not
know
what
they
concede
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
randolph
i
am
sorry
if
i
mislead
the
court.
all
i
intended
to
state
was
that
under
the
government’s
position,
the
validity
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
seizure
and
search
of
the
footlocker
in
this
case
would
be
the
same
if
it
were
seized
at
the
time
after
probable
cause
while
the
defendants
were
siting
on
the
footlocker.
mr.
randolph
but
it
is
important
that
the
seizure
occurred
and
it
is
important
and
i
have
explained
precisely
what
lead
up
to
that.
mr.
randolph
it
was
in
the
lawful
possession
of
the
federal
agents,
not
just
simply
for
the
moment
or
for
the
time
being.
they
could
have
kept
that
footlocker,
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
footlocker
was
being
used
to
transport
contraband.
that
made
it
forfeit.
beyond
that,
it
was
evidence
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
they
knew
that
it
was
leaking
talcum
powder,
they
knew
that
dog
alerted
to
it.
it
was
not
a
temporary
seizure
of
that
footlocker,
they
could
have
kept
that
footlocker,
they
could
have
kept
it
at
least
through
trial.
mr.
randolph
yes.
we
do
not
believe
that
is
the
test.
we
believe
that
this
case,
if
this
were
a
search
of
a
home,
of
course
there
is
no
question,
a
warrant
would
be
required.
mr.
randolph
it
is
not
clear
on
the
record.
i
think
our
brief
or
at
least
our
petition
said
that
they
used
the
keys
seized
from
mr.
machado.
but,
actually,
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct
in
light
of
the
testimony.
the
testimony
was
that
the
keys
were
seized
after
the
footlocker
was
opened.
so
if
that
testimony
is
accurate
from
the
agent
that
testified,
then
it
is
not
clear
on
the
record
how
it
was
opened.
mr.
randolph
the
reason
we
think
that
this
is
not
to
be
treated
like
a
home
where
a
warrant
is
required
is
the
same
reason
that
i
might
say
mr.
justice
black
in
his
dictum
stated
for
the
court
in
the
preston
case.
he
said
that
common
sense
dictates
that
questions
involving
searches
of
motor
cars
or
other
things
readily
moved
cannot
be
treated
identical
to
questions
arising
out
of
searches
of
fix
structures
like
houses.
mr.
randolph
because
the
reason
for
the
search
it
could
not
be
readily
moved
once
it
was
resting
in
the
office
of
the
agents,
i
agree
just
like
the
automobile
in
chambers
could
not
be
readily
moved
once
the
police
had
possession
of
it,
the
automobile
in
texas
v.
white.
but
the
seizure
itself
bringing
it
into
their
lawful
possession
justified,
we
think,
the
search
as
well
because
once
an
automobile
has
been
properly
seized
under
the
fourth
amendment,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
court
has
ruled
that
it
can
be
searched.
the
search
of
it
is
not
unreasonable
if
the
police
had
probable
cause
and
there
are
other
cases
where
even
when
they
do
not,
when
they
are
taking
an
inventory
in
south
dakota
v.
opperman,
for
example
and
the
same
is
true
here.
mr.
randolph
five
minutes
away.
mr.
randolph
the
courthouse,
yes,
it
was
nearby.
mr.
randolph
i
have
not
idea
it
was
9:10
at
night.
there
was
a
magistrate
there
the
next
morning.
mr.
randolph
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
randolph
we
will
concede
that
a
search
warrant
would
have
and
should
have
been
theirs
for
the
asking.
but
we
think
that
the
reason
a
search
warrant
is
not
required
is
the
same
reason
a
search
warrant
was
not
required
in
the
automobile
cases.
there
is,
we
submit,
no
rational
distinction
between
the
footlocker
involved
in
this
case
and
the
glove
compartment
of
an
automobile
or
the
trunk
of
an
automobile
which
can
be
opened
without
a
warrant.
mr.
randolph
we
think
that
could
be
opened
back
at
the
agents’
office
for
the
same
reason
that
the
trunk
of
an
automobile
can
be
opened
back
in
the
police
impoundment
lot.
the
glove
compartment
as
in
cooper
v.
california
could
be
opened
back
at
the
police
station,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
on
page
38,
is
it?
no,
i
am
sorry.
we
have
a
list
of
cases.
yes,
38.
mr.
randolph
of
our
brief.
at
the
top
of
38,
texas
v.
white,
the
search
was
at
the
front
seat
console.
mr.
randolph
no,
absolutely
not
and
cady
v.
dombrowski
was
a
locked
trunk.
in
sher
v.
the
united
states
was
locked
trunk,
in
chambers
v.
maroney
it
was
a
glove
compartment
and
one
case
that
was
just
enlisted
here
is
cooper
v.
california,
that
was
a
glove
compartment
as
well.
we
see
no
rational
distinction
between
the
two,
but
we
do
see
a
distinction
between
what
happened
here
and
the
search
of,
for
example,
a
person’s
bedroom.
in
that
case,
you
would
be
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment
where
the
most
protection
is
reasonably
demanded.
here,
we
are
not
at
the
core
of
the
privacy
interest
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
are
on
the
periphery,
i
do
not
think
respondents
reasonably
dispute
that,
it
is
not
the
same
as
a
house.
the
court
has
said
that
and
it
said
it
in
preston.
mr.
randolph
that
is
one
of
our
arguments.
mr.
randolph
that
is
right.
we
would,
the
first
part
of
our
argument.
we
think
it
adds
to
the
reasonableness
to
the
fact
that
they
were
arrested.
mr.
randolph
i
do
not
know
about
locked.
is
robinson
the
case
where
there
was
probable
cause?
mr.
randolph
well,
there
was
a
case,
i
think
it
was
robinson,
where
they
found
a
crumpled
cigarette
pack
which
was
closed
and
the
court
upheld
the
opening
of
that.
i
think
it
contained
pills
or
narcotics.
mr.
randolph
yes,
i
believe.
mr.
randolph
because
it
was
in
his
possession,
yes.
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
well,
draper
is
a
case
that
involves
that
type
of
situation,
whether
it
was
a
locked
briefcase
or
not,
i
do
not
know,
it
was
a
brown
leather
bag
that
was
zippered
close
and
the
court
upheld
the
search
of
that.
i
think
it
was
incident
to
arrest.
there
is
another
case
that
we
have
not
cited.
the
court
has
cited
it
usually
for
the
proposition
that
involves
plain
view
doctrine.
in
fact,
when
you
look
at
the
record,
it
involves
something
different,
it
is
a
case
called
united
states
v.
lee
which
is
the
coast
guard
shined
a
light
on
a
boat
and
they
saw,
the
way
the
case
is
described,
illicit
alcoholic
beverages
and
grain
alcohol
on
the
boat.
it
has
always
been
a
question
to
me
how
they
possibly
can
see
it,
the
search
was
upheld,
the
seizure
was
upheld
because
the
alcohol
was
in
cans,
it
was
not
in
bottles
and
some
of
the
search
took
place
back
at
the
docks.
so
i
think
that
is
probably
another
example,
mr.
justice,
although
it
has
not
been
used
for
that
proposition.
mr.
randolph
if
they
would
argue
that,
we
have
to
go
no
further,
but
they
said
that
it
is
not
incident
to
an
arrest
because
it
was
not
in
the
immediate
control
of
the
people
that
were
arrested.
we
think
that
is
irrelevant.
we
think
that
that
rule
was
set
down
so
that
arrest
would
not
be
used
as
pretexts
for
general
searches,
which
was
the
case
under
the
rabinowitz
rule
and
it
was
overruled
in
chimel,
but
these
people
were
caught
red-handed,
so
to
speak.
if
you
talk
about
expectation
of
privacy,
could
anyone
reasonably
expect
that
the
contents
of
that
footlocker
would
not
be
revealed?
they
were
caught
red-handed.
they
were
taken
back
to
the
station
house.
did
they
reasonably
expect
that
that
footlocker
was
going
to
be
inviolate,
that
the
police
were
not
going
to
open?
mr.
randolph
yes,
i
think
it
does,
the
court
has
used
the
phrase
“the
expectation
of
privacy”
in
a
number
of
recent
cases,
i
believe.
mr.
randolph
would
a
reasonable
man
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
once
he
is
arrested?
i
do
not
know,
i
think
that
the
privacy
still
continues
and
i
think
the
only
point
we
have
to
sustain
is
that
he
has
no
more
expectation
or
the
privacy
interest
in
no
greater
than
it
is
in
an
automobile
or
in
a
trunk
of
an
automobile
or
in
the
glove
compartment
of
an
automobile.
i
noticed
that
the
dissenters
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
south
dakota
versus
opperman
points
out
that
personal
effects
and
papers
are
carried
from
time
to
time
in
the
glove
compartment
of
an
automobile
and
i
suppose
that
is
true
with
footlockers
as
well.
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
the
question,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
you
asked,
which
is
that,
well,
if
the
agents
could
have
gotten
a
warrant,
why
should
we
not
require
them
to
go
get
one?
mr.
randolph
we
think
the
constitution
does
not
require
it.
the
agents
could
have
gotten
a
warrant,
as
i
have
said
in
cooper
v.
california,
in
texas
v.
white
and
in
chambers
v.
maroney
or
even
in
regard
to
the
clothing
in
edwards,
yet
the
warrantless
searches
were
upheld
in
all
those
cases.
mr.
randolph
edwards
would
be
like
that,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
randolph
yes,
i
believe.
it
may
have
been
in
a
station
house
or
in
the
jail,
i
am
not
sure.
the
test
the
court
had
said
in
cooper
and
edwards,
in
south
dakota
v.
opperman
is
not
whether
it
was
reasonable
to
procure
a
warrant,
but
whether
the
search
was
reasonable.
that
is
of
course
we
think
what
the
fourth
amendment
in
fact
says.
the
court
has
also
said,
on
a
numerous
occasions
that
searches
without
a
warrant
are
per
se
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
subject
only
to
a
few
established
and
well-delineated
exceptions.
well,
of
course,
the
court
has
never
had
a
case
like
this
before
so
it
has
not
created
an
exception,
had
no
case.
mr.
randolph
so
far,
the
court
has
never
had
occasion
to
pass
on
this
issue
and
that
if
it
had
established
an
exception,
it
would
have
been
dictum
so,
we
agree.
mr.
randolph
if
it
were,
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
gone
the
other
way.
mr.
randolph
we
agree
it
is
analogous,
but
it
is
not
exactly
directly
a
statement.
although
the
court
has
said
in
south
dakota
v.
opperman,
for
example,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
have
quoted
an
opinion
by
a
judge
wisdom
that
talked
about
containers
such
as
automobiles
drawing
no
line
between
what
the
container
was.
there
are
indications
in
the
opinions
going
our
way,
we
think.
mr.
randolph
if
i
may,
may
i
quote
your
opinion
in
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire
which
said
“it
is
true
the
automobile
has
wheels
and
some
locomotive
power,
but
given
the
virtually
universal
availability
of
automobiles
in
our
society,
there
is
little
difference
between
driving
the
container
itself
away
and
driving
it
away
in
a
vehicle
brought
to
the
scene
for
the
purpose.”
we
think
there
is
no
relevant
difference.
mr.
randolph
but
it
just
traversed
the
entire
continent
and
it
was
on
its
way
for
another
destination.
it
was
like
a
car
stopping
at
the
traffic
light.
mr.
randolph
no
and
neither
were
the
cars
in
chambers
v.
maroney
or
texas
v.
white
and
cady
v.
dombrowski,
and
so
on.
mr.
randolph
yes?
mr.
randolph
i
would
think,
as
some
would
suggest,
that
if
i
have
personal
belongings
on
me,
i
would
be
carrying
them.
i
would
want
them
close
to
me.
when
i
go
on
a
plane,
those
personal
documents
accompany
me.
i
keep
them
close
to
me
and
there
is
a
curious
thing
about
that
because
if
it
had
been
the
case
here,
this
people
had
been
arrested
with
a
suitcase
or
a
briefcase.
it
would
have
been
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest,
it
could
have
been
opened
up.
i
think
the
courts
are
fairly
unanimous
on
that
and
they
would
not
have
even
needed
a
probable
cause
to
open
that
briefcase
up.
mr.
randolph
no,
i
would
not
like
you
to
do
that,
if
that
is
all
you
would
do.
mr.
randolph
the
fact
of
the
arrest,
we
think,
adds
to
our
argument.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
i
rely
upon
that,
that
even
without
the
addition
of
the
arrest
which
brings
the
people
quickly
before
a
magistrate,
they
were
brought
the
next
morning
which
diminishes,
we
think,
the
privacy
interest
and
so
on,
but
even
without
that,
the
seizure
would
have
been
proper,
once
the
item
is
lawfully
in
the
government’s
possession,
yes.
i
would
like
to
just
say
a
word.
mr.
randolph
but
the
reason
for
the
arrest
was
not
the
same
reason
as
the
reason
for
the
search
and
cooper
v.
california
which
came
down
later,
also
written
by
mr.
justice
black
is
precisely
the
type
of
situation
we
have
here.
the
reason
for
the
arrest
was
the
reason
for
the
search.
the
search
took
place
back
at
the
station
house
and
the
court
upheld
it.
mr.
randolph
i
think
the
common
sense
language
does.
mr.
randolph
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
raining
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
randolph
yes,
just
a
few
points.
mr.
justice
white,
in
response
to
your
question,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
the
courts
of
appeals
are
unanimous.
i
know
no
decision
going
the
other
way
that
when
a
person
is
arrested,
a
closed
container
on
his
person
can
be
opened.
you
would
ask
me
whether
this
court
had
dealt
with
that
and
i
gave
you
the
cases.
mr.
randolph
i
think
we
cited
a
number
of
the
cases
in
our
brief
like
us
v.
hanz
or
soriano
stands
for
that,
schleis
is
another
case,
and
zaicek.
mr.
randolph
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
second
circuit’s
decision
in
zaicek,
i
guess
it
is.
that
was
an
attaché
case.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
there
is
a
decision
of
the
first
circuit
where
this
case
comes
from
after
we
filed
our
brief
called
united
states
v.
mccambridge,
it
is
not
cited,
it
was
just
decided
late
march.
it
is
76-1147
and
that
court,
in
an
opinion
by
the
same
judge
that
wrote
this
opinion,
upheld
the
opening
of
a
closed
briefcase
in
the
trunk
of
an
automobile
that
was
properly
seized
and
i
think
that
points
up
a
fact.
mr.
randolph
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
it
is
on
a
variety
of
different
theories,
mr.
justice.
sometimes
it
is
not
very
articulated.
mr.
randolph
no,
i
think
the
courts
generally
do
embrace
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
court
that
i
know
that
does
not
speak
of
it
as
luggage
exception.
mr.
randolph
unless
you
want
to
restrict
me
to
hotels,
i
think
that
it
would
be
analogous
to
the
baggage
cart
on
a
train
that
has
not
pulled
away
where
they
could
seize
it.
mr.
randolph
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
case.
mr.
randolph
if
it
is
lawfully
in
their
possession?
mr.
randolph
probably
in
the
government’s
possession?
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
yes,
the
case
which
was
not
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
almost
exactly
like
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
took
place
in
san
diego
train
station
about
two
weeks
after
this
shipment
took
place,
except
for
one
difference.
the
baggage
was
on
the
baggage
car,
they
had
a
dog
walk
up,
smelled
it,
the
police
went
or
the
agents
went
and
seized
the
luggage.
they
got
the
luggage
before
the
train
pulled
away
rather
than
at
its
destination.
the
case
is
united
states
v.
johnstone,
497
fed
2nd
397,
the
ninth
circuit,
1974
and
the
case
is
indistinguishable
from
this
one
even
on
the
facts.
thank
you.
