mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
on
three
separate
occasions,
twice
at
the
district
court
and
once
at
the
circuit
court,
has
tried
to
persuade
the
courts
that
this
search
falls
within
the
established
standards,
the
presumptive
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
they
have
explicitly
conceded
today
that
it
does
not
and
it
has
asked
this
court
to
use
this
case
as
a
vehicle
to
make
major
incursions
into
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
there
is
a
coherent
standard
which
prevails
on
even
warrantless
searches
and
that
is
the
katz
standard,
the
expectation
of
privacy
standard
and
by
admitting
that
no
existing
exception
to
the
search
warrant,
justifies
this
search
as
the
law
now
stands.
there
are
tremendous
consequences
towards
an
individual’s
expectation
of
privacy.
here,
there
was
a
seizure
as
there
are
frequently
in
automobile
cases.
ipso
facto,
the
government
says
you
can
therefore
search.
well,
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendants
that
there
was
a
constitutional
distinction
of
great
importance
between
an
automobile
and
a
footlocker.
with
a
footlocker,
a
briefcase,
and
a
trunk,
and
all
kinds
of
other
containers
which,
unlike
a
car,
are
often
a
repository
for
private
property
which
unlike
a
car
are
not
constantly
the
subject
of
non-criminal
investigations
of
contact
with
the
police,
with
regulations,
with
inspection,
with
motor
vehicle
laws,
with
all
he
various
indicia
which
this
court
in
the
cady
case
and
in
the
opperman
case
have
said
reduces
one’s
expectation
of
privacy
in
an
automobile.
that
the
government
has
conceded
and
as
those
cases
state
that
the
mobility
of
a
vehicle,
like
the
arguable
mobility
of
a
trunk,
has
grounds
for
seizure,
it
is
grounds
for
immobilization
of
the
property,
but
the
court
has
stated
and
the
government
concedes
in
their
brief
on
page
35
that
mobility
in
and
of
itself
is
not
a
justification
for
a
search.
the
justification
for
the
search
following
the
seizure
in
the
automobile
cases
is
the
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
which
an
individual
has
in
a
vehicle,
particularly
following
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
cady
and
in
opperman.
those
justifications
for
the
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
in
automobile
are
not
present
in
the
case
with
the
footlocker
or
not
present
in
the
case
of
a
brief
case.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
but
it
is
true
that
if
this
court
did
in
fact
make
that
decision,
that
the
citizens
would,
from
here
on
and
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy.
the
real
question
is,
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
standards
of
the
fourth
amendment
justify
a
decision
which
in
fact
reduces
the
expectation
of
privacy
and
we
would
state
that
the
entire
body
of
jurisprudence
starting
with
ex
party
jackson,
through
katz,
the
us
v.
van
leeuwen,
does
not
justify
that
kind
of
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
if
i
was
arguing
those
cases,
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
but
henceforth
that
argument
cannot
be
made.
there
were
distinctions
why
this
court
found
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
automobile.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
those
distinctions
which
justify
the
automobile
cases
are
not
present
in
this
case
and
that
i
would
argue
that
this
court
should
not
establish
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
brief
case,
in
a
footlocker
trunk,
in
luggage.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct
and
the
fourth
amendment
at
its
very
basis,
up
until
this
time
creates
a
presumptive
warrant
requirement
in
the
cases
under
the
fourth
amendment,
particularly
the
ex
party
jackson
case,
the
van
leeuwen
case,
do
not
restrict
the
fourth
amendment
privacy
protections
of
the
warrant
clause
to
homes.
they
very
explicitly
state
that
sealed
packages,
mail,
letters
can
be
taken
out
of
the
home
wherever
they
maybe
found,
people
have
the
justification
of
privacy
and
the
right
to
the
protection
of
the
warrant
clause.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
to
the
extent
that
the
lower
courts
have
developed
any
coherent
philosophy
surrounding
their
holdings
in
these
cases,
they
have
been
generated
by
the
chimel
case
and
that
has
been
an
immediate
control
case.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
what
they
have
really
done
is
frozen
the
situation
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
and
asked
the
question,
could
the
arrested
defendant
put
their
hand
into
a
briefcase
or
into
a
suitcase
and
take
out
evidence
to
destroy
or
remove
or
could
they
take
out
a
gun
which
would?
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
i
would
argue
that
there
is
really
a
—
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
there
is
no
established
rule.
there
has
never
been
a
coherent
rule,
there
has
never
been
a
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
government
would
argue
that...
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
no,
i
do
not
think
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
there
is
no
established
rule.
that
is
some
of
the
issues
left
opened
in
various
decisions.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
it
is
relevant.
by
analogy
to
any
kind
of
container
where
there
is
indicia
of
privacy,
a
double
locked
footlocker
would
perhaps
contain
the
most
drastic
indicia
of
privacy.
it
is
the
least
accessible
to
an
arrested
defendant.
it
is
the
most
secure
even
if
it
was
in
a
trunk
of
a
vehicle.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
no,
it
would
not.
if
it
was
in
the
person’s
control,
there
was
at
least
accessibility
to
it
at
the
time
of
arrest.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
it
would
not
because
in
the
auto-search
reduction
of
expectation
of
privacy
could
be
used
as
the
basis
for
that
decision.
so,
there
are
distinctions.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
being
held
by
the
traveler
who
was
arrested
in
draper.
it
was
a
zippered
bag
and
it
was
not
locked
to
the
best
of
my
recollection.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
two
crucial
distinctions
are,
here
we
have
a
double
locked,
really
unportable
footlocker.
it
is
so
heavy
to
move
and
second
one
is...
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
right,
that
would
be
the
principal
distinction
as
a
distinction
of
degree.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
we
are
talking
here
specifically
of
when
mr.
machado
was
sitting
on
it
as
opposed
to
where
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
and
arrest?
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
firstly,
this
court
could
justify
that
search
without
necessarily
justifying
the
chadwick
search
because
of
the
location
of
the
search
and
because
of
the
double
locks.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
i
would
argue
they
could
not
search
it,
but
if
this
court
decided
otherwise,
it
does
not
govern
the
chadwick
situation.
i
would
suggest
that
under
the
chimel
situation,
you
really
do
need
an
infactability
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
when
the
positions
of
the
people
are
frozen
to
reach
in
and
get
either
evidence.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct
your
honor,
there
are
distinctions
both
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
the
fact
that
the
footlocker
trunk
was
not
being
held
and
the
fact
that
the
double
locks
made
it
impossible
under
any
conceivable
circumstances
to
have
the
contents
of
the
trunk
accessible.
what
the
government
has
asked
for
here...
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
double
lock
is
your
honor
and
back
at
the
fbi
and
the
dea
office,
they
already
had
the
key
which
had
been
seized
from
mr.
machado
and
used
that
key.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
my
recollection
is
that
that
was
the
suitcases,
but
i
maybe
mistaken.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
difference,
again,
is
that
the
freezing
effect
under
the
chimel
case
at
the
time
of
arrest,
could
a
person
go
into
the
container
with
any
kind
of
likelihood
at
all
and
comport
with
the
justifications
for
the
search
incidents
or
arrest
theory
which
now
are,
which
is
removal
and
destruction
of
evidence
or
the
protection
of
the
officer?
there
is
no
justification
under
chimel
as
now
stands
for
search
incident
to
arrest,
the
immediate
control
area
except
those
justifications.
it
is
not
a
search
aimed
necessarily
at
obtaining
evidence
for
the
government.
it
is
a
search
aimed
at
preserving
evidence
from
the
danger
of
an
arrested
person.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct,
but
when
speaking
in
terms
of
expanding
the
search
incident
to
arrest
theory,
i
think
it
is
important
to
go
back
to
the
original
justifications
for
the
exception.
robinson
was
really
decided
by
saying
we
do
not
want
police
officers
to
have
to
make
justifications,
every
time
when
someone
is
arrested,
they
protect
themselves
to
form
the
intent
as
to
why
they
are
searching.
but,
when
we
are
asking
to
make
a
major
expansion
of
the
chimel
doctrine
here
which
would
state
that
the
government,
when
there
is
an
arrest
and
has
probable
cause
of
contraband,
can
search
not
only
a
footlocker,
but
all
the
suitcases.
under
the
government
doctrine,
anything
that
they
have
probable
cause
contains
contraband
is
susceptible
to
search.
there
is
no
limitation
upon
that.
that
is
an
expansion
of
the
chimel
doctrine
in
a
very
dramatic
way,
it
is
an
expansion
which
is
overruled,
it
is
where
chimel
overruled
rabinowitz.
that
was
the
same
theory
that
this
court
recognized
before
chimel.
it
is
almost
trying
to
be
resurrected
by
the
government
in
this
case.
the
government
forms
a
distinction,
but
in
the
home
and
that
is
a
distinction
which
is
just
not
justified
either
by
history
or
by
the
expectation
of
privacy
cases
which
have
emanated
from
the
fourth
amendment.
the
distinction
that
you
have
a
greater
degree
of
privacy
in
an
envelope,
a
briefcase,
a
trunk
at
home
rather
than
outside
of
the
home
is
really
the
very
basis
of
the
government’s
theory.
that
is
a
basis
which
history
does
not
support
because
the
searches
which
history
was
directed
to
occurred
both
in
the
home
and
outside
the
home
and
it
is
also
a
theory
which
is
not
justified
by
the
mobile
society
we
now
live
in.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
they
are
more
likely
to
have
something
happen
to
it
but,
under
the
prevailing
standards
of
this
court
what
would
happen
to
it,
would
have
to
happen
to
it
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant.
in
the
home
situation
like
coolidge,
those
cases
held
the
coolidge
case,
the
jeffers
case,
the
taylor
case
that
you
have
to
immobilize
the
object
of
a
search,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
distinction
between
the
intrusions
of
a
seizure
of
an
immobilization,
of
standing
guard
at
the
door,
of
standing
guard
at
the
driveway
and
incurring
the
second
search,
the
greater
search
which
is
opening
up
the
seized
or
immobilized
container.
to
that
extent,
a
home
is
important,
a
home
is
indicia
of
privacy.
but
this
society,
both
in
its
history,
in
its
jurisprudence
and
most
importantly
in
the
policy
justifications
of
why
we
need
a
warrant
and
what
kind
of
society
we
live
in,
it
is
no
longer
a
society
of
homes,
it
is
a
mobile
society.
the
government’s
theory
is
if
a
police
officer
thought
they
had
probably
cause
of
something
in
a
lawyer’s
briefcase
or
a
judge’s
briefcase
as
they
left
their
office
or
left
their
courthouse
contained
evidence,
contraband
that
would
be
immutable
to
a
search
without
the
necessity
of
going
to
a
court.
that
is
the
basic
difference.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
draper
requires
the
arrest,
which
is
the
government’s
fallback
theory.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
yes,
under
their
request
for
a
luggage
exception
or
for
a
briefcase
exception
to
the
search
warrant.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
court
made
a
finding
of
no
probable
cause.
when
that
dog
scratched
the
trunk,
if
the
police...
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
if
the
police
comported
themselves
with
the
fourth
amendment
and
made
a
lawful
search.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct
your
honor.
however,
the
fact
that
they
did
not
do
it
is
of
the
highest
constitutional
significance
because
decisions
are
made
to
regulate
police
conduct
and
they
are
made
for
innocent
people,
as
well
as
people
that
are
likelier,
have
probability,
have
contraband
in
their
suitcase.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct,
it
is
a
factual
situation
which
has
been
relied
on
by
lower
courts.
what
i
am
stating
is
that
is
firstly
–
second
thing
is
that
this
case
is
different.
it
is
different
in
qualitative
ways
because
of
the
privacy
indicia
of
the
trunk
and
because
of
its
general
inconsistency
with
the
justifications
under
chimel
for
the
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
no
your
honor.
the
longest
period
of
time,
we
had
anything
other
than
an
automobile
held,
is
a
29
hours
that
a
12-pound
package
would
state
a
claim
on
the
outside
in
us
v.
van
leeuwen
was
held.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
excuse
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
government
had
the
right
to
retain
the
footlocker
for
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
there
has
never
been
a
case
which
really
says
it
is
30
hours
or
40
hours.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
government,
once
having
seized
the
footlocker
whether
the
pursuant
to
forfeiture
or
to
exigency,
then
had
an
obligation
to
get
judicial
permission
to
create
the
greater
intrusion
which
is
the
search
intrusion.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
argument
would
help
my
client
a
great
deal
in
this
case
because
if
the
conduct
of
the
government
was
improper
in
the
method
in
which
they
searched
and
seized,
in
particular
searched,
then
the
exclusionary
rule
permits
the
exclusion
of
evidence
and
that
is
the
deterrent
effect
that
it
regulates
police
conduct
and
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct,
that
is
true
in
almost
every
case.
in
the
katz
case,
there
was
clearly
gambling
information
being
transmitted
over
the
phones,
but
the
government
improperly
electronically
surveilled
the
conversation.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
rely
on
the
subjectively
known
by
the
possessor
of
a
trunk.
it
relies
on
certain
guidelines
and
standards,
which,
in
this
case
were
not
comported,
within
the
failure
to
comport,
within
the
results
of
the
exclusion
of
the
crucial
evidence.
whereas,
i
concede
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
a
search
warrant
would
have
been
issued
and
the
government
had
the
right
to
lawfully
hold
the
property.
that
just
goes
to
show
the
lack
of
necessity,
the
lack
or
exigency,
the
lack
of
emergency
of
not
obtaining
a
warrant,
not
obtaining
that
prior
judicial
approval
which
this
court
has
held
so
often
as
necessary
for
the
searching
of
private
goods.
once
again,
the
luggage
is
no
different
under
these
circumstances
than
a
home
search,
a
briefcase
search
and
any
of
the
other
searches
which
the
supreme
court
has
held
are
protected
by
the
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
what
the
consent
exception
is
for.
the
person
has
the
right
to
require
the
government
when
they
are
intruding
on
private
property,
except
in
very
limited
circumstances,
to
get
a
search
warrant.
they
can
consent
to
the
warrantless
opening,
that
is
one
of
the
exceptions,
these
individuals
did
not
consent.
they
implicitly
asserted
their
right
to
privacy
and
their
right
to
require
the
government
under
the
presumptive
warrant
standard
of
this
court
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
that
is
just
the
calculus
made
by
defendants
in
trouble.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
nor
would
it
have
mattered
whether
it
was
one
ounce
of
marijuana
or
broken
talcum
powder
bottle
or
199
pounds
of
diaries,
books
and
the
most
private
possessions.
that
footlocker
trunk
is
imbued
with
the
privacy
that
the
case
is
ex
party
jackson,
united
states
v.
van
leeuwen
and
katz,
given
in
this
society
at
this
point.
the
government’s
attempt
really
here
is
to
use
the
cases
of
vehicle
to
make
a
major
incursion
in
when
they
have
to
go
get
a
warrant
without,
as
all
other
exceptions,
the
least
bit
of
need.
that
was
only
a
minor
inconvenience
in
this
situation
to
get
a
search
warrant.
they
go
right
past
the
federal
courthouse
in
boston
on
the
way
to
the
dea
building.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
they
have
found
at
all
kinds
of
hours,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
hardworking
magistrates,
your
honor
and
they
are
available
by
telephone.
the
warrants
are
issued
at
all
hours
in
boston
and
again,
the
footlocker
could
have
been
held
until
the
next
morning
barring
consent
and
a
warrant
then
could
have
been
requested.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
it
was
the
caretaking
function
in
combination
with
the
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
in
automobile.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
car
was
seized
pursuant
to
a
state
forfeiture
statute,
it
had
been
held
for
at
least
a
week.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
it
is
only
in
terms
of
there
is
a
forfeiture
statute
governing
the
containers
of
contraband.
however,
that
statute
only
goes
for
seizure,
it
does
not
go
to
search
and
the
justification
for
the
search
in
cooper.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
because,
cooper
is
an
automobile
and
automobiles
have
a
less
of
an
expectation
of
privacy
than
luggage
and
footlocker.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
the
rationale
which
was
stated
in
opperman
was
that
it
was
a
caretaking
function.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
opperman
related
to
cooper
and
held
that
it
was
a
caretaking
function
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
police
were
allowed
to
go
into
the
car.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
because,
of
the
privacy
interest
in
the
footlocker
are
far
different
than
the
privacy
interest
in
the
car.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
if
it
is
being
held
prior
to
a
search,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct.
the
statute
permits
seizure.
the
next
step
is
a
search.
the
search
requires
a
warrant.
if
the
search
discloses
contraband,
then
you
would
not
need
a
second
warrant.
then,
it
could
be
held
pursuant
to
the
forfeiture
statute,
but
until
then
it
is
a
temporary
hold
on
the
seizure
powers
until
the
search
discloses
what
is
in
it.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct,
that
is
the
distinction
that
is
critical.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
yes
your
honor.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
it
goes
to
the
limits
of
the
seizure
power
which
have
not
yet
been
definitively
decided.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
if
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment,
the
judge
may
begin
to
pen
down
an
impartial
decision.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause
the
container
in
fact
contained
contraband.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
is
correct
your
honor.
at
this
stage
it
is
stipulated.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
that
would
be
lawful.
it
is
the
involvement,
again,
of
the
judiciary
and
not
merely
the
opinion
of
a
police
officer
and
his
involvement
in
an
investigation.
that
would
decide
when
the
search
occurred
because
we
are
conceding
the
seizure,
a
police
officer
because
of
the
exigencies
can
make
a
seizure,
but
because
of
the
lack
of
exigencies,
once
having
made
the
seizure,
judicial
permission
is
needed
for
the
search
which
is
the
greater
intrusion.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
once
again,
that
would
be
a
search
by
a
private
party
and
not
by
the
government.
mr.
martin
g.
weinberg
it
might
change
the
expectation
of
privacy
of
an
individual
regarding
what
the
common
carrier
can
do,
but
it
would
not
change
the
expectation
of
privacy
regarding
the
intent
by
the
government
to
find
evidence
of
a
crime.
thank
you.
