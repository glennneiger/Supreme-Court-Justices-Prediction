the

the
new
crime
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
a
due
process
revocation
proceeding.
early
during
the
service
of
the
intervening
sets,
two
questions
must
be
analyzed,
the
source
or
nature
of
the
interest
and
the
process,
which
is
due
if
there
is
an
interest.
as
the
fact
in
the
case
will
reveal,
such
a
hearing
in
this
case
will
determine
how
much
of
the
almost
six
years
due
on
the
petition
is
first
sentence
will
be
served
concurrently,
with
his
present
sentence
and
thus
will
effect
his
ultimate
release
date
from
custody
all
together.

while
he
was
on

while
he
was
on
