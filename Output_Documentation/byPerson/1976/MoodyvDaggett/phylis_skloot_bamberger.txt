ms.

your
honor,
under
this
scheme,
let
us
step
back
a
minute
and
say
that
he
is
in
fact
still
on
parole.
his
parole
has
not
been
revoked;
it
has
not
been
taken
away
from
him.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
your
honor,
the
scheme
of
the
rules
under
which
this
case
takes
place
of
the
parole
board
and
visions
that
there
is
indeed
a
good
likelihood
or
a
possibility
of
concurrency
and
in
fact
in
jones
against
johnson
decided
by
the
dc
circuit
in
--
notes
a
survey
taken
by
the
federal
parole
board,
which
would
indicate
that
one
in
three
of
such
parolees
do
in
fact
serve
their
sentence
concurrently
or
have
to
detain
and
revoked
all
together.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
your
honor,
under
the
rules
as
they
applied
in
this
case
and
those
rules
are
no
longer
in
effect
because
of
the
new
statute
and
the
new
rules.
the
board
would
review
a
file,
the
parole
board
file
and
we
know
that
the
file
consisted
of
the
pre-sentence
report,
the
case
agents
report,
the
information,
which
the
supervising
parole
officer
had
obtained
during
the
period
of
parole.
at
the
end
of
that
review
the
board
could
give
one
of
three
dispositions.
it
could
revoke;
it
could
remove
the
detainer
all
together.
in
that
situation,
the
parolee
would
get
full
concurrency
with
the
present
sentence
and
in
fact
he
would
be
restored
to
the
position
that
he
would
have
been
in,
had
the
warrant
never
been
issued
that
is,
he
would
get
street
time,
he
would
get
good
time
and
his
sentences
would
in
essence
be
running
at
the
same
time.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it
would
have,
yes;
it
would
have
lost
no
time
back
to
the
date
of
his
release
in
fact.
now,
the
other
--
the
second
disposition,
which
the
board
could
have
made,
is
to
revoke
parole.
now,
that
is
where
we
get
into
the
question
and
the
real
possibility
which
would
come
up
in
a
case
such
as
this,
from
the
moment
of
the
board's
decision
to
revoke
parole,
this
sentence
would
start
to
run,
would
commence
to
run
concurrently,
with
the
new
sentence.
in
other
words
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
stopped
the
time
on
the
first
sentence
from
running.
when
the
board
gives
its
review
and
makes
a
decision
to
execute
the
warrant
in
essence
to
revoke
parole,
from
that
moment
onto
the
board's
regulation,
the
time
commences
to
run
again
and
it
is
in
fact
running
concurrently,
with
the
new
term
and
so
he
is
actually
serving
the
two
sentences
at
the
same
time
and
his
release
date
on
the
first
sentence
will
obviously
be
shortened
because
he
is
serving
that
sentence.
now,
the
third
disposition,
the
one
which
took
place
here
is
to
have
the
file
review
and
to
do
nothing.
to
let
detect
the
warrant
and
the
detainer's
stand.
in
that
situation
it
is
automatic
under
the
board's
prior
rules
and
under
the
present
rule
that
the
first
sentence
will
be
served
consecutively
to
the
new
sentence
so,
that
when
he
is
released
from
the
second
sentence
and
returned
to
the
federal
institution
he
then
recommences
that
first
sentence
and
he
has
to
serve
it.
now,
he
maybe
released
on
parole
at
some
point
later
on
but,
he
still
either
in
custody
or
in
parole
custody.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
your
honor
that
get
to
the
question
of
retroactive
concurrency
in
other
words
at
the
time?.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
possible
under
the
boards
rule.
there
is
no
provision
either
under
the
old
rules
or
under
the
new
rules.
for
the
board
to
make
the
sentence
run
back
to
an
earlier
point
in
time.
if
the
board
does
not
give
its
hearing
at
an
earlier
date
during
the
service
of
the
intervening
sentence
it
looses
the
power
to
make
that
term
run
back
to
a
certain
date.
i
think
that
the
crux
of
the
matter
here
is
that,
he
or
at
least
one
of
them,
one
of
the
liberty
interest?..
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
board?.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
they
could
reparole
him
or
well
at
that
point
they
could
several
things.
they
could
remove
the
detainer
all
together
so,
that
he
would
get
full
concurrency.
now,
in
a
situation
where
a
parolee
has
committed
a
new
crime
that?.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
they
could
removed
the
detainer
and
the
one
and
the
detainer
altogether.
that
would
put
him
back
in
a
position
that
he
would
remain
at
the
date
of
his
first
release
he
would
get
fore
credit
for
all
that
time
from
the
date
of
his
release
to
the
date
of
board
decision,
which
may
in
fact.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
they
cannot
give
him
partial
retroactive
concurrency.
in
other
words,
if
a
man
is
released
from
parole
january
1
and
he
finish
and
he
violates
and
he
is
sentenced
to
a
new
sentence
and
he
serves
that
sentence
and
he
is
released
on
january
1
of
the
following
year.
at
that
point,
he
gets
a
parole
revocation
hearing.
the
parole
board
unless
it
totally
lists
the
detainer
cannot
make
his
term
run
again
from
the
first
january
1.
it
cannot
make
his
term
run
from
say
from
march
1
or
april
1.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it
can
lift
it
altogether.
but,
that
eliminate
from
the
board
its
third
option
which
is
to
let
the
sentence
run
concurrently
from
some
intermediate
point
during
the
intervening
sentence.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
not
if
it
revokes,
no.
now,
if
it
revokes
during
the
period
of
the
intervening
sentences
from
that
moment
say,
in
march
1
of
this
january
1
sentence.
the
first
term
will
continue
to
run
as
of
march
1
so
he
will
get
10
months
credit
on
his
on
old
sentence.
he
will
loose
the
first
two
months
of
credit
if
the
board
revokes
altogether
--
i
am
sorry
if
the
board
lifts
the
warrant
altogether
then
he
will
get
full
years.
what
the
board
cannot
do
at
the
end
of
the
intervening
sentence
is
to
make
the
term
run
concurrently
from
some
retroactively
to
some
intermediate
date.
it
could
give
him
the
full
term
but
not
at
partial
term
of
credit.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
by
then
he
lose
--
the
revocation
causes
him
to
lose
--
the
answer
to
that
is
not
the
same
thing
because
he
is
still
in
parole
custody
as
oppose
to
having
complete
freedom.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
but
there
cannot
be
any
doubt
about.
the
board
could
do
that
in
its
discretion
but
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
total
freedom
is
better
than
the
conditional
freedom
of
parole.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
you
mean
to
give
him
partial?
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
partial
retroactive,
it
could
but
they
there
is
still
another
problem.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that
is
right.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
oh
yes,
if
--
and
assuming
--
and
in
fact
there
are
several
states
that
do
that
it
is
interesting
that
two
of
the
amicus
(ph)
in
this
case
require
that
sentence
run
consecutively.
there
is
no
discretion
in
the
board
one
way
or
the
other,
the
sentence
is
must
run
consecutively.
in
that
case
there
is
no
deprivation
of
liberty
as
opposed
to
having
a
liberty
interest
and
yes
the
board
could
do
that
and..
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it
could
not
defeat
liberty
interest
but
it
could
make
the
denial
of
that
liberty
interest
not
in
a
essence
of
denial
it
could
make
it
harmless,
yes
that's
right.
except
that
there
is
a
another
sight
to
this
liberty
interest
and
that
is,
when
a
person
is
in
an
institution
with
a
parole
detainer
lodged
against
him,
the
board
is
in
effect
imposing
conditions
of
parole
it
has
modified
the
conditions
of
parole
because
of
the
affect
of
that
parole
detainer
upon
the
prison
conditions.
now
this
is
not
the
argument
that
was
rejected
in
meachum
and
montayne
although
we
do
present
that
argument
in
our
briefing,
we
believe
that
under
the
bureau
of
prisons
regulation
there
is
an
interest
in
the
conditions
that
a
prisoner
has
in
an
institution.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
oh
yes,
there
is
a
difference
and
in
fact
two
states
which
again
signs
the
amicus
brief,
direct
they
lodge
the
detainer
so
that
the
confining
prison
will
have
notice
that
there
is
another
preceding
pending
and
then
they
lift
the
detainer
with
a
notice
to
the
confining
institution
that
the
detainer
is
not
to
have
any
effect
on
the
conditions
of
confinement.
now
as
a
bureau
of
prisons
regulations
cited
in
our
brief
indicate
there
is
consideration
separately
of
the
facts,
of
the
new
crime
and
the
fact
of
the
detainer
being
present.
the
reason
is
two
fold,
number
one
the
bureau
prison
considers
in
making
it
is
classification
study
both
the
length
of
total
confinement.
now
where
there
is
a
detainer
pending
the
length
of
total
confinement
can
be
much
longer
because
he
may
have
to
serve
the
parole
sentence
and
the
parole
board
has
in
essence
notified
not
only
that
it
wants
to
take
this
man
back,
but
that
he
may
have
to
serve
a
very
long
sentence
or
some
sentence
at
the
end
of
the
intervening
sentence.
the
other
thing
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
considers
in
this
classification
study
is
whether
the
individual
can
sustain
himself
in
a
position
of
relatively
unsupervised
or
degree
of
supervision
that
he
is
required.
now
if
the
detainer
is
present
it
is
an
indication
to
the
bureau
of
prisons,
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
parolees
ability
to
structure
himself
without
constant
watching
and
that
also
goes
into
the
classification
study,
what
institution
he
will
be
in,
what
jobs
will
be
available
to
him
whether
he
will
be
on
minimum
or
maximum
custody
in
that
institution
so
that
yes
the
detainer
does
have
a
definite
and
separate
impact
aside
from
the
fact
of
the
new
crime
on
the
classification
now?
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes
and
that
are
what
the
government's
argument
but
the
answer
to
that
i
think..
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
i
think
the
answer
is
as
follows
because
the
decision
making
process
as
far
as
the
board
is
concerned
includes
much
more
than
just
the
institutional
conduct.
the
institutional
conduct
will
always
be
there
for
them
to
review
on
documents
that
are
presented
by
the
institution
periodical,
but
the
board
is
also
concerned
with
his
life
out
in
the
community
while
he
was
out
on
parole,
the
full
parole
board
file
which
includes
fbi
report,
correspondence
from
various
people
and
the
facts
of
the
new
crime
now...
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
your
honor
that
gets
right
to
the
question
of
the
nature
of
this
right
that
the
federal?
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
of
the
parolee's
right.
the
federal
parole
scheme
requires
a
two-stage
process
exactly
like
the
one
outlined
in
morrissey.
there
is
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
and
in
this
case
that
is
out
of
the
picture,
but
this
also
the
disposition
aspect
of
the
case.
the
board
has
an
obligation
to
make
a
disposition
it
is
not
required
to
make
any
particular
disposition,
it
is
not
required
to
revoke
and
this
gets
back
to
an
earlier
question
that
was
asked,
if
the
board
were
required
to
revoke
on
the
basis
of
a
new
conviction,
then
he
would
not
have
any
claim,
conviction
would
eliminate
his
interest
in
conditional
freedom
which
was
provided
by
the
grant
of
parole.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well
let
me
answer
that
by
saying
that
the
board
can
consider
an
early
hearing,
all
of
the
non-institutional
factors
related
to
medication.
now,
now,
yes,
get
to
you
--
if
they
make
the
decision
and
is
unfavorable
to
the
parolee,
during
the
term
of
his
institution,
the
board
has
the
right
to
reopen
based
on
information
it
receives
i
think
from
the
institution
so
that
it
can
reconsider
an
adverse
decision
to
the
parolee,
based
on
institutional
conduct.
now,
if
they
render
a
favorable
decision
to
the
parolee
and
he
is
granted
paroles,
so
he
can
serve
a
dual
status,
which
he
is
recognized
in
the
parole
scheme,
he
can
be
serving
the
second
sentence
and
on
parole
with
respect
to
the
first
sentence,
the
board
can
in
essence
revoke
the
parole
that
it
had
granted
him,
based
on
his
prison
conduct.
so,
the
board
is
not
left
without
a
remedy
either
looking
to
the
favorable
or
adverse
institutional
conduct.
now,
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not,
this
reconsideration
of
the
case
has
to
have
an
in
court
appearance
the
due
process
requirements
of
such
a
review
proceeding
is
not
before
the
court,
but
the
board
is
not
precluded
even
by
its
own
rules
it
never
has
been,
from
considering
institutional
conduct.
in
the
first
situation
under
the
rules
which
applied
at
the
time
this
case
came
up
it
did
by
an
annual
review
--
under
the
board's
present
statute,
they
can
always
reopen
and
always
reconsider
information
which
is
presented
to
them.
so,
i
think
that
the
argument
that
the
institutional
conduct
has
to
be
considered
is
correct,
but
it
does
not
go
far
enough.
because
what
we
have
to
do
is
we
have
to
freeze
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
would
come
up
with
respect
to
the
life
in
the
community
and
the
factors
of
the
new
crime.
now,
the
question
of
mitigation
of
course
goes
to
what
process
is
due
under
the
circumstance.
what
is
the
interest,
what
is
the
private
interest
of
the
parolee
in
presenting
his
mitigating
circumstances
and
i
think
that
that
is
where
that
factor
comes
up.
if
a
parolee
has
committed
a
new
crime,
the
board
can
consider
that
it
also
can
consider
its
full
record.
but
at
the
time
of
this
record
review,
the
parolee
is
not
allowed
to
be
present,
he
does
not
know,
what
is
in
the
parole,
what
file,
because
until
the
present
statute
and
the
possible
applicability
of
their
right
to
privacy
act
proficiency,
had
no
disclosure
of
the
file.
now,
we
do
not
know
what
the
file
indicates
in
this
case,
but
the
government
has
indicated
from
the
facts
it
has
presented
that
there
are
certain
mitigating
circumstances,
for
instance.
in
this
case,
the
judge
could
have
sentenced
the
defendants
up
to
life
imprisonment,
he
did
not,
he
gave
him
two
consecutive
terms
of
custody
--
i
am
sorry,
two
concurrent
terms
of
custody
of
only
up
to
ten
years.
although
he
is
discretion
to
impose
a
life
sentence,
was
presents
he
also
made
the
sentence
run
under
4208a2,
which
meant
that
the
parole
board
could
parole
him
on
the
second
crime
at
any
point
it
decides.
obviously
the
judge
believed
that
they
was
something
there
which
did
not
require
the
full
extent
of
his
sentencing
power.
now,
the
government
appendix
includes
a
document
from
the
parole
board
files,
and
it
is
interesting
because
that
document
in
itself
contains
information
which
is
not
confirmed,
which
we
do
not
know
is
error.
for
instance,
it
indicates,
that
he
murdered
his
wife,
in
fact
that
was
not
the
crime
that
he
was
convicted
of,
he
was
convicted
of
voluntary
man
slaughter
in
the
heat
of
passion.
now,
we
do
not
know
what
those
facts
are,
it's
not
reflected
in
the
record,
nor
in
the
documents
which
the
government
chooses
to
add
as
part
of
its
appendix.
it
reflects
that
there
was
a
conflict
as
to
his
family.
the
report
indicates
that
his
family
had
alcoholic
problems.
he
indicates
that
he
had
a
good
family
relationship.
now
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
to
provoke
parole,
where
the
parolee
will
live
is
obviously
an
important
consideration.
there
is
a
very
critical
dispute
of
fact
here,
which
should
have
been
resolved
that
is,
in
a
situation
where
the
parolee
could
present
his
mitigating
circumstances.
now
the
government
argues
that
they
were
no
mitigating
circumstances
presented
here.
i
think,
the
fact
is
due
impart,
number
one
to
the
possibility,
which
is
reflected
in
the
record
that
mr.
petitioner
did
not
know
that
he
could
submit
mitigating
circumstances.
he
was
never
told
that
and
the
documents
submitted
by
the
board
established
that
fact.
the
second
factor
of
course
is
the
same
as
in
goldberg
is
that
he
might
not
have
known
how
to
do
it
or
what
was
relevant
or
what
to
put
before
the
court
because
he
had
no
representation,
no
one
who
could
assist
him
in
that
and
then
as
another
matter
he
never
knew
the
basis
for
the
board's
decision
to
make
his
sentence
run
consecutively
because
they
never
told
him
what
factors
they
were
considering
and
the
reasons
for
their
decision
to
make
the
sentence
run
consecutively.
so,
the
absence
of
mitigating
circumstances
here,
should
not
be
held
against
the
petitioner
and
in
fact
the
record
as
presented
by
the
government
indicates
that
there
maybe
substantial
disputes
of
fact
and
the
board
should
have
known
both
sides
of
the
story
in
an
amply
presented
argument
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
now,
if
the
government
argues
that
its
total
discretion
to
revoke
the
parole
after
a
new
crime
eliminates
liberty
and
eliminates
the
parole
status
which
he
still
presently
enjoys
the
answer
ti
think
is
that
both
gagnant
and
morrissey
and
goldsmith
and
roth
dispute
that
argument.
they
lay
it
to
rest.
gagnant
and
morrissey
both
say
that
we
have
here
there
is
a
vested
interest
which
he
still
has
both
the
state
and
the
parolee
have
an
interest
in
accurate
fact
finding
and
in
informed
used
of
discretion.
the
citation
in
roth
to
goldsmith
indicates
that
the
board's
discretionary
power
must
be
construed
to
mean
an
exercise
of
discretion
after
investigation,
notice
hearing
an
opportunity
to
respond.
none
of
that
was
afforded
here.
now,
the
remedy
that
would
be
afforded
the
petitioner
in
this
instance
would
be
first
if
the
court
would
define
that
there
was
not
an
interest
and
we
are
also
to
find
that
is
protected
by
due
process.
the
first
remedy
would
be
to
remand
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
lost
any
mitigating
evidence
due
to
the
substantial
delay
between
1971
in
this
time
in
granting
the
time
of
hearing.
if
that
were
not
true,
if
he
had
not
lost
any
mitigating
evidence
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
parole
revocation
under
the
new
statute.
now
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
consider
the
new
statute,
if
we
were
to
find
that
the
old
proceedings
were
invalid
because
the
new
statute
affords
the
petitioner
certain
due
process
rights,
which
may
indeed
satisfy
morrissey
depending
upon
how
the
board
or
the
commission
now
chooses
to
enforce
its
new
rules.
first
it
provides
them
with
counsel,
second
it
may
provide
him
with
disclosure
of
the
full
file,
third
the
board
may
find
that
under
its
regulations
it
can
provide
notice
of
the
reasons
and
the
facts
underlying
its
decision
and
its
own
regulations
require
notice
of
the
underlying
charges
and
the
reason
and
arbitron
(ph)
procedures.
so
that
i
think,
if
we
find
that
the
old
procedures
were
invalid
that
the
new
ones
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
be
used
in
this
situation
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
provides
with
due
process.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
it
is
still
a
live
case
because
the
petitioner
here
is
not
eligible
for
hearing
under
the
new
rules
because
there
is
a
provision
in
the
statute,
which
says
that
any
valid
order
of
the
parole
board
shall
not
be
reopened
or
reconsidered
under
the
new
statute.
so
that
unless
the
old
procedures
are
deemed
invalid
which
we
believe
they
are
because
there
is
an
interest,
there
is
a
present
interest
as
roth
defines
it
and
the
old
procedures
did
not
adequately
protect
that
interest
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
proceeding
to
determine
whether
or
not
his
parole
should
be
revoked
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
should
get
concurrent
sentences
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
as
the
board
has
the
option
to
do,
to
leave
the
detainer
in
effect.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
that's
right,
the
only
thing
that
could
happen
is
that
the
board
could
periodically,
review
the
institutional
reports
and
perhaps
revise
its
decision
based
on
those
reports,
but
it
wouldn?t
reconsider
the
mitigating
factors
with
respect
to
his
life
on
parole,
with
respect
to
the
crime
and
other
factors
which
he
may
choose
to
introduce.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
the
government
refers
to
its
new
regulation
to
say,
that
they
can
give
partial
retroactive
concurrency.
i
think
the
government
misconstrues
the
words
of
the
regulation.
if
not
the
intent
it
relates
to
(inaudible)
under
the
statute,
a
parolee
who
violates
by
anything
but
a
new
conviction
or
a
new
crime
is
entitled
to
receive
credit
for
the
time
that
he
has
served
while
on
parole.
the
exception
is
for
a
parolee
who
violates
the
parole
by
the
commission
of
the
new
crime.
he
loses
his
(inaudible)
time
and
that
section
relates
directly
to
the
loss
of
(inaudible).
the
question
of
retroactive
concurrency,
partial
retroactive
concurrency
i
think
is
answered
by
4214
d
which
is
the
relief
provision
of
the
new
statute
which
applies
to
the
hearing
which
is
granted
at
the
end
of
the
intervening
sentence
and
it
lists
five
dispositions
which
the
board
might
make
at
a
hearing
granted
at
that
time
and
partial
retroactive
concurrency,
is
not
one
of
them.
the
board's
own
regulation
section
2.52
does
not
include
that
as
a
possible
remedy.
i
think
the
government
misconstrues
the
decision
in
zerbst.
in
zerbst
the
petitioners
were
requesting
that
the
parole
board
must
make
the
sentences
run
concurrently.
we
are
not
urging
that
they
must
do
so,
we
are
urging
that
they
--
in
the
situation
where
they
may
do
so,
there
must
be
a
due
process
proceeding,
because
the
board
must
--
because
that
is
a
liberty
interest
which
he
currently
possesses.
now,
i
think...
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
not
at
the
end
your
honor,
hearing
will
occur
at
the
end,
but
he
will
be
harmed
because
of
the
affect
of
the
detainer,
because
of
the
modification
of
the
parole
conditions,
which
results
from
the
detainer,
while
he
is
in
the
institution
and
from
the
loss
of
concurrency.
now,
getting
to
the
government's
interpretation..
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
well,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
total
withdrawal
of
the
detainer
and
the
warrant
at
the
end
of
the
intervening
sentence,
where
the
new
crime
is
serious
is
not
likely
to
occur.
but
what
is
more
likely
to
occur
is
the
possibility
of
concurrency
where
the
violated
does
not
get
everything
but
he
gets
something
and
the
inability
to
give
the
partial
retroactive
concurrency
deprives
the
parolee
of
that
intermediate
dispositional
aspect
which
the
commission
can
grant.
i
think
the
government
misconstrues
that
line
in
morrissey
and
gagnon
which,
morrissey
which
relies
on.
that
section
relates
to
those
jurisdictions
in
which
there
is
no
discretion
where
there
is
a
violation
of
parole
not
to
revoke,
in
other
words
as
in
tennessee,
where
the
sentences
must
be
served
concurrently
on
a
finding
of
violation,
that
sentence
in
morrissey
would
apply,
that
would
not
need
to
give
a
hearing
on
the
dispositional
aspect
of
the
case.
but
where
there
is
a
discretion,
morrissey
in
no
fewer
than
three
places
at
480,
484,
488
and
at
gagnon
in
411
and
790
say,
that
where
there
is
this
discretion,
the
hearing
must
be
given
and
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
in
gagnon,
the
violation
was
admitted
by
the
parolee.
he
said,
he
had
committed
the
burglary
and
so,
the
court
with
that
fact
still
viewed
the
dual
aspect
of
the
process
very
important.
ms.
phylis
skloot
bamberger
oh,
yes,
we
are
not
disputing
that
he
has
admitted
it,
but
we
are
saying
that
even
where
he
admits
it,
the
dispositional
phase
is
still
critical
and
the
government
attempts
to
distinguish
morrissey
and
gagnon,
saying
that
they
do
not
apply
where
the
parolee
has
admitted
the
violation.
they
are
hardly
distinguishable
if
that
fact
existed
in
those
very
cases.
the
government
asserts
here
that
we
urge
that
an
oral
hearing
is
required.
now,
it
is
all
position
that
the
old
board's
rule
which
did
not
provide
for
notice,
disclosure
of
the
file,
any
kind
of
representation
or
any
statement
of
the
facts
or
reasons
does
not
comport
with
morrissey.
if
the
court
finds
that
is
true,
then
the
parolee
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
hearing
at
the
present
time.
now,
under
the
new
rules,
he
would
be
entitled
to
more
than,
what
he
had
been
entitled
to
then
and
it
is
all
position
that
perhaps
in
some
situations,
an
oral
hearing
would
not
be
required,
but
that
this
is
not
a
decision
which
the
court
must
make
now.
