unknown
speaker
do
you
suggest
that
there
is
some
expectation,
a
basis
for
an
expectation
or
it
would
be
--
allowed
to
be
concurrent.
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
work
out
in
fact
mrs.
bamberger,
would
you
explain
that
to
us,
how
the
concurrency
comes
about?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
full
concurrency
that
means
that
the
time
that
he
would
be
serving
under
his
first
sentence
begins
to
run
again.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
could
--
at
that
later
step
beheld
to
have
served
a
concurrent
way.
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
possible?
unknown
speaker
the
court
couldn't
release
him?.
unknown
speaker
it
could
not
release
him.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
after
her
served
his
first
sentence.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
that
is
what
they
could
not
do?
unknown
speaker
but
it
can
lift
the
retainer.
unknown
speaker
let
me
see
if
i
follow
your
deal.
are
you
saying
that
the
board
may
not
board
in
and
credit
time
served?
unknown
speaker
but
mrs.
bamberger
may
it
not
do
this
substantially
the
equivalent
thing
by
deciding
to
the
parole
on
somewhat
earlier
than
they
otherwise
would
have
paroled
him.
unknown
speaker
correct
and
he
could
be
released
incarceration
in
earlier
date
than
he
otherwise
would.
unknown
speaker
could
the
problem,
this
problem
you
describe
be
cured
by
an
amendment
to
the
board
regulations
to
give
them
little
broader
discretion
at
that
point.
unknown
speaker
give
them
power
to
allow
partial?
unknown
speaker
well
then
before
you
get
on
the
other
one
let
me
clear
up
another
thing
that
troubled
me.
you
pointed
out
that
if
there
were
total
revocation
--
if
there
revocation
immediately
upon
conviction
of
the
state
crime
that
then
the
sentences
under
present
regulations
would
be
served
concurrently.
that's
the
benefit
of
your
client
laws.
unknown
speaker
but
we
should
decide
the
case
for
you
it
is
not
possible
the
board
would
adopt
new
regulation
which
would
change
that
and
make
it
the
normal
practice
to
make
the
sentence
be
consecutive
rather
than
concurrent.
unknown
speaker
so
that
your
liberty
claim
really
is
contingent
if
i
understand
you
correctly
and
the
present
form
of
the
board
regulations
the
board
could
revise
their
regulations
in
a
way
that
would
defeat
the
liberty
interest
which
you
assert.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
bamberger
on
that
point
would
you
help
me
because
it
is
a
kind
of
settled
point
but
is
there
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
conditions
of
confinement
between
having
a
detainer
lodged
against
a
man
or
any
alternative
having
no
detainer,
but
having
the
fact
noted
of
recorded
that
he
was
convicted
of
a
state
crime.
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
mrs.
bamberger
that
the
conduct
of
the
prisoner
in
prison
under
the
second
sentence
for
whatever
period
he
is
there
would
have
some
bearing
on
the
parole
board's
exercise
or
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
they
ought
to
then
and
require
him
to
serve
all
of
the
balance
of
his
first
sentence?
unknown
speaker
why
should
they
--
that
would
be
compelling
to
make
the
decision
before
they
know
what
his
conduct
is.
unknown
speaker
are
not
you
overlooking
the
fact
that
they
have
already
determined
that
he
has
committed
a
criminal
act
and
there
is
full
due
process,
a
judgment
of
a
court
that
he
has
violated
his
conditions
of
his
parole.
unknown
speaker
of
which
right?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
the
board's
position
might
be
that
we
don't
want
to
make
the
decision
on
whether
we
revoke
the
parole
until
we
see
how
he
conducts
himself
in
this
second
round
under
his
second
conviction,
that
is
if
during
that
second
period
his
conduct
is
such
that
he
has
denied
all
his
good
time
credits
if
he
engages
in
prison
riots
and
violence,
i
suppose
you
agree
that
the
parole
board
would
not
be
very
sympathetic
with
having
his
sentences
run
concurrently.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
this
still
a
live
case,
mrs.
bamberger,
if
new
rules
have
been
substituted
for
the
ones
that
you
are
litigating?
unknown
speaker
if
the
court
rules
against
him
then
he
would
not
have
the
advantage
of
the
new
rule,
if
the
court
rules
against
your
constitutional
convention
content,
he
could
not
go
back
and
say
well
now,
i
want
a
hearing
under
the
new
rules.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
easterbrook.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
can
i
just
ask
you
right
at
that
point,
is
it
your
view
that
morrissey
does
not
apply
to
any
case
in
which
the
parolee
admits
the
fact,
justifying
revocation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
esterbrook
i
do
not
have
the
morrissey
opinion
in
front
of
me,
but
i
have
a
recollection
of
there
being
discussion
of
the
double
need
for
fair
procedure,
one,
to
establish
the
fact
of
violation
and
another
on
the
dispositional
phase.
unknown
speaker
how
is
that
question
different
from
the
question
you
have
in
any
criminal
case
where
you
have
first
the
determination
of
guilt
where
clearly
there
must
be
due
process
applied
and
then
a
subsequent
discretionary
hearing
before
the
judges
to
what
sentence
you
will
be
imposed.
i
take
it
that
she
does
require
fair
procedure
at
sentence
hearing,
why
is
the
situation
different?
unknown
speaker
but,
are
you
saying,
putting
the
sixth
amendment
to
one
side
for
a
moment
--
are
you
saying
that
the
due
process
clause
has
no
application
to
a
sentencing
hearing
and
a
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
do
the
same
proceeding
(voice
overlap)
criminal
trial.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
underlying
theory
that
there
is
no,
he
has
no
--
this
is
not
going
to
have
any
depravation
of
his
liberty
as
a
result
of
his
sentencing
hearing,
how
do
you
analytically
pick
that
in?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
criminal
proceeding
that
is
gone
once
he
is
found
guilt?
unknown
speaker
he
has
an
insufficient
interest
in
whether
the
sentence
is
for
ten
days
or
for
life
to
justify
due
process.
unknown
speaker
what
about
it
could
get
probation?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
mean
either
he
has
his
liberty
or
not?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
a
judge
could
be
arbitrary
in
sentencing?
you
mean
a
judge
could
say
that
everybody
coming
here
with
red
hair,
i
give
ten
years
and
those
who
do
not
have
red
hair
i
will
probate.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
that
need
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
this
shows
that,
that
the
record
shows
you
never
gave
any
reason,
but
the
record
show
that
he
had
sentenced
40
people,
20
redheads
and
20
non
redheads
each
redhead
had
gotten
20
years
and
each
non
redhaed
had
been
paroled.
you
would
not
any
thing
wrong
with
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook,
but
there
is
a
big
differences
between
that
and
the
question
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
in
elrod
against
burns
they
allegedly
were
discharged
for
constitutionally
impermissible
reason,
namely
they
exercised
the
free
speech
right,
he
said
there
is
no
constitution
right
to
be
a
redhead.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
constitution
is
neutral
on
the
point,
it
is
completely
independent
of
any
constitutional
claim.
unknown
speaker
how
long
in
the
british
common
law
and
this
law
in
the
united
state
has
it
been
since
a
judge
asked
do
you
have
any
think
to
say
before
i
pay
a
sentence
on
you,
how
long
has
that
been
going
on.
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
that
been
growing
on
in
the
british
common
law?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
good
enough.
unknown
speaker
alright
just
waste
of
time.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
are
not
you
really
arguing
the
(inaudible)
law
that
you
have
to
argue
it,
to
sustain
the
government's
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
you
have
ten
minutes
that
i
would
suggest.
unknown
speaker
i
hate
to
interrupt
as
you
get
to
the
heart
of
your
argument
but
your
directed
my
attention
to
page
488,
and
you
just
used
the
term
that
the
opinion
suggested
that
the
hearing
would
be
useful,
but
as
i
read
the
sentence
the
parolee
must
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
to
show
if
can
that
he
did
not
violate
the
condition
or
if
he
did
that
the
circumstances
and
mitigation
suggest
that
the
violation
does
not
revocation.
they
must
language
applies
to
both
consideration.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
language
on
page
480
is
constituently
inaccurate?
unknown
speaker
but
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
you
refer
to
the
new
parole
act,
i
understood
it
was
your
opponent's
contention
that
the
new
parole
act
didn't
have
any
application
to
this
case
because
her
client
was
not
able
to
take
advantage
of
it,
if
the
old
procedures
were
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
so
when
you
have
refer
to
a
provision
of
the
new
parole
act
in
your
argument
you
are
referring
to
a
provision
that
would
have
some
applicability
in
your
view
to
the
petitioner.
unknown
speaker
well
it
could
allow
both
either
partial
or
total
concerns
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
could
allow
total
concerns
by
simply
a
decision
that
they
would
not
revoke
parole
at
all.
unknown
speaker
that
might
be
even
eliminate
the
seconds
hearing.
unknown
speaker
but
under
morrissey
which
will
no
longer
be
applicable
as
it
will
be
superseded
at
least
by
the
new
act,
when
this
occurs,
under
the
morrissey
the
first
preliminary
hearing
might
result
in
a
determination
not
to
have
a
second
hearing
at
all,
would
it
not.
unknown
speaker
hypothetically,
they
might
have
got
to
the
wrong
man
the
person
with
the
same
name
or
that
the
violation
of
parole
was
so
minimal
that
if
wasn't
significant.
unknown
speaker
mr.
easterbrook
may
i
just
raise
a
question,
you
may
answered
it
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
one
of
their
arguments
as
i
gathered
is
that
under
existing
rules
if
there
had
been
an
immediate
revocation
hearing
and
presumably
there
would
have
been
revocation,
then
the
sentences
would
have
been
required
to
run
concurrently
and
he
has
automatically
lost
that
benefit
by
the
delay.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
justice
steven
question
would
be
quite
that
whether
or
not
there
was
a
need
for,
but
whether
or
not
in
fact
that
is
what
happens.
unknown
speaker
i
answered
the
question
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have,
assuming
that
they
do
have
a
prompt
hearing
and
make
prompt
decision
to
revoke
then
your
opponent
says
that
the
rules
provide
that
in
that
eventuality
the
sentence
will
be
concurrent.
is
your
opponent
correct
or
not.
unknown
speaker
so,
revocation
will
begin
or
this
--
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
the
man
had
been
pardoned.
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
if
the
man
had
been
pardoned
and
that
nobody
notified
the
board,
that
would
have
been
a
mistake
then.
unknown
speaker
so
you
cannot
be
sure
that
no
way
they
are
mistaken.
unknown
speaker
thank
you
mr.
easterbrook.
mrs.
bamberger,
do
have
a
something
more.
unknown
speaker
you
have
five
minutes.
unknown
speaker
i
hope
that
due
process
hearing
occur
when,
as
and
if
the
parole
is
revoked.
unknown
speaker
perhaps
it
will
cleared,
perhaps
the
action
will
result
in
its
being
concurrent,
how
can
you
predict
that?
unknown
speaker
has
he
not
admitted
it
here?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
the
case
is
submitted.
