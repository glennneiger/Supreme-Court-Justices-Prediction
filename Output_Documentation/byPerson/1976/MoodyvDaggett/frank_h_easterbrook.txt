mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
claim
of
a
right
to
an
immediate
oral
parole
hearing
in
this
case
has
an
air
of
impossibility
to
it.
petitioner
is
not
now
suffering
imprisonment
on
account
of
his
parole
violations.
no
one
proposes
to
revoke
his
parole
now.
he
suffers
no
loss
of
freedom
now
because
of
the
possibility
of
revocation
a
year
from
now
when
his
sentences
for
murder
and
man
slaughter
will
come
to
an
end.
his
loss
is
caused
by
his
intervening
convictions
and
ten-year
sentence.
the
possibility
of
revocation
eventually
is
not
caused
by
the
detainer
lodged
against
him.
it
was
caused
by
the
intervening
convictions
upon
his
plea
of
guilty.
petitioner
has
had
a
full
hearing
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
and
the
murder
convictions
establish
a
full
foundation
for
the
eventual
revocation
of
parole,
if
that
is
what
the
parole
commission
decides
to
do.
in
the
sentencing
hearing
on
his
two
convictions,
he
had
both
the
opportunity
and
the
incentive
to
bring
forward
any
mitigating
evidence
he
might
have
that
might
induce
either
the
sentencing
judge
or
the
parole
commission
to
treat
him
leniently.
petitioner
has
met
with
a
social
worker
in
federal
prison
and
refused
even
to
discuss
with
a
social
worker
any
mitigating
conditions
or
circumstances.
he
told
the
social
worker
that
all
the
information
was
in
his
file.
that
statement
appears
at
page
26a
if
the
appendix
are
brief.
to
this
day,
petitioner
has
not
said
what
he
wants
to
say
in
an
immediate
oral
dispositional
hearing,
let
alone
what
he
wants
to
say
that
can
not
be
conveyed
equally
well
on
paper.
he
has
made
no
claim
that
would,
if
true,
induce
the
parole
commission
to
revoke
his
parole
and
to
let
the
revocation
run
concurrently.
i
would
evoke
my
argument
to
three
propositions.
first,
that
no
hearing
is
necessary
at
any
time
once
the
violations
of
the
conditions
of
parole
have
been
established
as
they
were
here
beyond
dispute.
second,
that
the
time
for
an
oral
hearing
if
one
is
required,
does
not
arrive
until
the
end
of
the
intervening
sentence
when
the
parole
commission
decides
to
revoke
a
petitioner's
parole.
third,
that
if
something
is
required
before
that
time,
the
parole
commission's
dispositional
review
procedure
provides
ample
safeguards
against
error.
the
due
process
clause
requires
a
hearing
concerning
the
revocation
of
petitioner's
parole
in
this
case;
only
if
petitioner
has
a
liberty
interest
or
a
property
interest
in
continuing
to
be
a
parolee.
we
think
that
there
is
no
liberty
of
property
interest
in
a
case
like
this
one.
petitioner
doubtless
has
an
interest
in
a
constitutional
sentence
held
in
common
with
his
other
men
in
being
free
from
imprisonment
until
by
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
confident
jurisdiction
it
has
been
decided
that
he
must
surrender
that
interest
for
a
period
of
years.
that
interest
was
extinguished
for
a
period
of
ten
years
by
his
1962
conviction
for
rape.
petitioner
served
a
little
more
than
four
years
of
that
before
being
released
on
parole
and
that
release
on
parole
restored
to
him
a
form
of
conditional
liberty,
parole,
created
by
statute,
the
terms
and
conditions
and
extent
of
which
were
defined
entirely
by
statute.
this
new
conditional
liberty
is
a
creature
of
statute
and
petitioner
has
no
more
of
it
than
the
statute
provides.
the
federal
statutes
and
regulations
provide
for
termination
of
this
conditional
liberty
if
the
parolee
commits
another
crime
that
happened
here.
once
that
happens,
every
fact
necessary
to
revoke
parole
has
been
established.
the
decision
whether
to
revoke
parole
in
response
to
those
facts
is
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
parole
commission.
let
me
make
it
clear
that
we
have
no
dispute
with
morrissey's
holding
that
a
grant
of
parole
sets
up
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
that
can
be
revoked
only
upon
provision
of
due
process.
what
this
means
though
is
that
before
revoking
parole,
the
responsible
officials
must
determine
by
a
procedure
comporting
with
the
due
process
clause,
that
the
conditions
of
the
parole
have
been
violated.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor
that
is
our
view,
it
is
our
view
in
some
that
once
the
facts
justifying
the
revocation
have
been
established,
those
facts,
forfeit
the
claim
of
entitlement
to
remain
free
and
once
that
claim
of
entitlement
can
no
longer
be
setup
against
the
parole
authorities,
there
is
no
remaining
liberty
or
property
interest.
petitioner
is
pleaded
guilty
to
second-degree
murder
and
to
voluntary
man
slaughter
two
violations
of
the
terms
of
his
parole.
no
more
is
required;
those
convictions
ended
his
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
retain
his
statutory
liberty
interest.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right
your
honor,
there
are
two
discussions
of
that
sort
in
morrissey,
one
discussion
appearing
at
page
490
of
the
morrissey
opinion,
says,
"if
it
is
determined
that
petitioners
admitted
violations
to
the
parole
board
and
if
those
violations
are
found
to
be
reasonable
grounds
for
revoking
parole
under
state
standards,
that
would
end
the
matter."
that
has
happened
here,
there
have
been
two
convictions
of
guilty,
it
is
clear
that
those
convictions
are
reasonable
grounds
for
revoking
parole,
when
we
think
that
ends
the
matter.
but
morrissey
went
on
the
say,
that
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
parole
hearing
and
this
is
at
page
488.
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
parole
board
should
exercise
discretion.
we
have
no
dispute
with
that
either,
the
relevant
federal
statutes,
both
at
the
time
of
the
consideration
of
petitioner's
case
and
now,
provide
for
two
hearings.
one
is
an
alternate
hearing
before
parole
is
revoked
and
one
is
the
dispositional
review
which
may
or
may
not
include
a
hearing
depending
upon
whether
the
parole
commission
believes
that
one
is
necessary.
so,
we
have
no
dispute
with
a
proposition
that
it
is
useful
to
have
a
hearing
to
determine
how
the
discretion
shall
be
exercised.
the
question
whether
the
constitution
requires
that
hearing
is
we
think
left
open
in
morrissey
because
in
morrissey
the
fact
of
violation
itself
was
disputed
and
the
question
whether
the
constitution
required
hearing
in
the
absence
of
such
a
dispute
was
not
before
the
court.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
there
is
one
way
in
which
it
is
different
and
one
way
in
which
it
is
the
same
your
honor,
the
way
in
which
it
is
different
is
that
that
is
part
of
the
criminal
process
and
it
is
directly
controlled
by
the
sixth
amendment.
this
court
held
in
(inaudible),
the
counsel
was
required
to
do
the
sentencing
hearing
basing
its
holding
entirely
on
the
sixth
amendment.
but
the
court
held
in
morrissey
and
gagnant
that
the
sixth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
parole
revocation
hearings
and
to
parole
proceedings.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
we
are
saying
that
the
due
process
clause
has
no
application
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
is
right
your
honor,
the
court
held
inspect
against
paterson,
a
case
that
cited
and
discussed
in
our
brief,
that
there
is
no
need
of
a
sentencing
hearing
conducted
by
state
authorities
to
allow
the
accused
to
be
heard
or
to
present
evidence.
it
is
our
view
that
that
is
the
same
here,
once
it
is
been
established,
beyond
doubt
that
there
has
been
a
violation
as
here.
there
is
no
need
to
allow
the
accused
to
be
present
or
to
present
evidence.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
analytical
theory
i
think
is
that
the
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
remain
free
the
liberty
interest.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
he
is
gone
once
he
is
found
guilty.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
his
interest
in
the
range
of
sentences
is
protected
by
the
statute
establishing
the
range
of
permissible
sentences
and
of
course
in
the
federal
system,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
arbitrary
procedure
in
the
federal
system.
the
congress
has
provided
for
procedures
that
go
in
our
view
well
beyond
what
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
a
federal
system,
yes
he
could
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
federal
system
allows
a
broad
range
of
alternatives
from
suspended
sentence
to
a
sentence
the
maximum
under
the
statute.
the
question
whether
that
is
provided
is
entirely
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge.
that
proposition
is
supported
by
the
druzinski
(ph)
in
418
u.s.
in
which
the
court
held
not
even
a
statement
of
reasons
is
required
for
what
the
judge
does
and
that
there
is
no
way
under
the
present
constitution
and
statutes
to
inquire
into
what
the
judge
has
done
unless
congress
provides
explicitly
that,
that
should
be
done.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
that
raises
a
question
of
a
different
sort,
that
is
the
question
of
the
reliance
on
an
impermissible
reason.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
our
view
if
there
is
no
reason,
then
the
judge
have
whole
discretion
and
the
parole
commission
has
whole
discussion,
let
me
setup
contrast
between
two
cases..
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
your
honor
we
would
and
we
would
find
some
thing
wrong
in
the
reliance
on
an
impermissible
and
irrelevant
reason,
but
the
question
whether
it
permissible
to
rely
on
irrelevant
or
impermissible
reason
is
different
from
the
question
whether
there
must
be
an
oral
hearing
to
determine
whether
such
consideration
have
added
the
process.
let
me
offer
as
an
example;
elrod
against
burns,
the
case
decided
last
spring
and
which
the
court
held
that
employees
who
held
their
positions
in
illinois,
at
discretion
of
their
employer.
no
statutory
safe
guards,
no
property
interest
in
there
employment,
could
not
be
discharged
for
reasons
based
on
their
political
believes.
that
was
use
of
an
improper
reason,
yet
at
the
same
time
the
employees
in
elrod
against
burns
were
in
the
same
position
as
the
employees
and
board
of
regents
against
roth,
they
could
be
discharged
for
any
reason,
without
they
need
for
a
hearing.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
might
be
suggested
your
honor,
that
you
have
very
little
choice
in
being
a
redhead
at
birth.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
think
the
point
is
the
same
your
honor,
though
that
a
claim
that
a
decision
has
been
made
for
impressible
reason
is
very
different
form
a
claim
that
a
decision
has
been
made
without
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
an
oral
hearing
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
a
hearing
in
every
case
in
order
to
minimize
or
avoid
the
possibility
of
reliance
on
an
improper
reason.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
in
some
states
the
right
of
allocution
is
not
now
allowed.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
in
the
federal
system
it
has
been
going
on
as
long
as
i
know.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
and
it
is
provided
by
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
i
am
about
to
turn
to
over
little
bit
less
ambitious
argument,
second
point
is
that
if
a
hearing
is
required,
it
is
not
required
now,
more
as
he
indicated
as
i
discussed
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens's
questions,
but
the
hearing
would
be
helpful
to
determine
whether
the
authority
should
exercise
discretion
to
revoke
parole.
in
the
federal
system
a
hearing
is
provided
at
the
end
of
the
intervening
sentences
murder?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
to
the
extend
them
must
clause
applies
the
both
consideration
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
on
page
490
of
the
same
opinion
indicating
that
if
it
were
established
there
would
have
been
a
violation?
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
is
inaccurate
in
light
of
language
on
page
490,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes,
that
is
our
position,
petitioner
is
not
now
subjected
to
imprisonment
as
a
parole
violator.
his
imprisonment
is
justified
by
the
ten-year
sentence
imposed
in
1971,
for
murder
and
manslaughter.
morrissey
held
and
this
time
a
quote
another
sentence
on
page
488
of
the
same
opinion,
that
the
right
time
for
the
hearing
was
"a
reasonable
time
after
the
parolee
is
taken
into
custody."
petitioner
has
not
yet
been
taken
into
custody
as
a
parole
violator.
so,
the
time
set
by
the
court
for
a
hearing
has
not
yet
arrived.
several
reasons
support
the
decision
of
congress
to
defer
hearings
until
the
expiration
of
the
intervening
sentence.
revocation
is
the
rule
and
earlier
hearings
will
be
useless
in
most
cases.
the
hearing
at
the
end
of
the
intervening
sentence
is
the
best
time
because
then,
the
parole
commission
has
available
to
it
all
of
the
information
about
the
parolee's
institutional
behavior
and
can
answer
the
question,
should
the
prisoner
now
be
released?
it
will
have
access
to
the
parolee's
prison
record
and
it
will
avoid
the
inconvenience
of
sending
teams
of
examiners
to
prisons
to
make
recommendations
that
will
in
every
case
or
almost
every
case
have
to
be
reconsidered
at
the
end
of
the
intervening
sentence.
a
hearing
could
be
required
years
before
the
ultimate
decision
on
revocation
only
if
the
detainer
affected
liberty
of
property
rights
in
some
way.
as
we
understand
that
this
is
the
core
of
petitioner's
argument.
petitioner
has
suggested
a
number
of
ways
in
which
that
might
happen.
the
detainer
might
affect
the
conditions
for
confinement
on
the
intervening
sentence,
the
delay
might
jeopardize
the
opportunity
for
concurrent
service
of
the
term
or
the
delay
might
permit
the
laws
of
mitigating
evidence.
we
submit
that
the
argument
about
affect
on
the
conditions
of
confinement
must
yield
to
this
court's
decision
in
meachum
against
fano,
which
held
it
when
prison
officials
have
descretioned
to
choose
the
place
and
conditions
of
confining,
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
particular
procedures
to
be
used
in
making
that
choice.
the
choice
itself
does
not
involve
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement.
in
the
federal
prison
system
it
is
true
as
petitioner
contends
that
the
officials
know
whether
there
has
been
a
detainer
and
in
many
cases
they
consider
whether
that
detainer
should
have
any
effect
on
their
decisions.
but,
the
fact
that
a
detainer
has
been
considered
is
known
from
the
fact
in
meachum
that
the
prison
officials
considered
whether
the
prisoners
there
had
committed
arson
or
had
been
alleged
to
commit
arson
or
might
commit
arson.
the
question
is
not
whether
particular
facts
have
been
considered
in
making
the
decision.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
duty
to
respond
to
those
facts
in
particular
ways
that
is
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
have
particular
conditions
of
confinement.
there
is
none
in
the
federal
prison
system.
petitioner
has
not
contended
that
there
is
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
liberty
or
property
interest
from
that
source.
second
source,
the
one
with
which
petitioner
opened
the
argument.
if
the
argument
that
opportunities
for
concurrent
revocation,
concurrent
service
of
the
revoked
term
will
be
lost.
we
submit
that
that
argument
is
simply
fallacious.
it
is
fallacious
as
matter
of
fact
and
it
doesn't
help
petitioner
even
if
it's
true.
first,
because
of
the
dispositional
review
that
is
now
provided,
the
warrant
can
be
dismissed
and
the
detainer
released
with
or
without
an
oral
hearing.
the
absence
of
an
oral
hearing
does
not
prevent
concurrent
service
of
the
term.
but
more
importantly,
after
the
intervening
sentence
has
expired,
the
commission
has
a
number
of
options
available
to
it,
each
of
which
will
achieve
in
practice,
the
equivalent
of
concurrent
service.
first,
the
commission
can
decide
simply
not
to
revoke
parole,
to
withdraw
the
warrant,
to
treat
it
as
if
it
that
never
existed,
that
achieves
concurrent
service
in
practice.
it
can
decide
to
revoke
and
grant
immediate
reparole
and
that
is
provided
by
section
4214
d5
of
the
parole
commission
act.
this
has
much
of
the
same
effect,
but
we
understand
that
petitioner's
objection
to
the
revocation
and
the
immediate
reparole
is
that
it
will
extend
the
length
of
the
time
as
a
parolee
and
that
there
are
some
ancillary
restrictions
during
that
extent
of
time.
the
parole
commission
has
a
statutory
device
to
deal
with
that.
section
4211
of
the
new
parole
commission
act
says
that
the
commission
can
on
its
own
motion
terminated
supervision
over
the
parolee
at
any
time
so
that
although
his
time
as
a
parolee
might
be
extended
by
a
revocation
and
immediate
reparole,
the
commission
has
the
discretion
under
4211
to
terminate
that
supervision
achieving
concurrency
or
partial
concurrency,
retroactively.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
the
new
act
both
applies
and
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
under
the
new
act,
it
is
not
possible
for
petitioner
to
seek
a
reopening
of
decisions
that
were
already
made
under
the
old
procedures.
but
the
question
whether
petitioner
will
be
released
on
parole
after
the
end
of
his
convictions
for
murder
and
manslaughter
will
be
decided
by
procedures
under
the
new
parole
act
and
that's
why
we
are
relying
on
the
provisions
of
the
new
parole
act
to
show
what
options
the
commission
will
have
that
is
disposal
when
a
year
from
now
petitioner
is
released
from
his
current
sentence
by
virtue
of
good
time.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
it
would
your
honor.
the
commission's
next
option
is
an
option
set
up
by
28cfr2.5c2
which
we
reprint
at
page
19(a)
to
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
it
says
that
the
commission
can
revoke
but
"may"
decide
to
forfeit
the
intervening
time
served
before
enduring
in
the
intervening
conviction.
commission
interprets
this
as
allowing
partial
concurrent
revocation
reiteratively
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
to
be
worried
about
petitioner's
argument
that
the
parole
commission
does
not
have
that
option
when
the
parole
commission
itself
believes
that
it
does
and
will
act
though
it
does.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
it
could.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
they
would
probably
have
a
second
hearing
to
determine
which
of
the
courses
they
would
follow
and
that
would
be
a
full
oral
adversarial
hearing.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
it
might,
if
it
were
to
determine,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that's
right
your
honor.
in
this
case
petitioner
would
be
on
much
sounded
ground
asking
for
an
immediate
oral
hearing,
if
petitioner
were
contending
that
he
was
not
the
person
who
was
convicted
of
murder
and
manslaughter
1971
in
arizona.
but
that
argument
has
never
been
made.
finally
petitioner
has
an
argument
that
mitigating
evidence
might
be
lost
in
interim
and
that
this
will
effect
the
commission's
ultimate
decision,
but
petitioner
has
never
contended
that
he
has
any
such
evidence.
his
habeas
corpus
pleading
on
the
district
court
in
this
case
contended
that
the
reason
for
requiring
and
prompt
hearing
was
to
have
the
opportunity
for
concurrent
service
of
the
revoked
sentence.
moreover
the
commission
has
rules
that
will
allow
him
to
have
an
oral
hearing,
if
he
were
to
make
persuasive
claim
that
he
has
mitigating
evidence,
that
it
might
effect
the
decision
and
that
it
might
be
lost,
but
petitioner
has
never
made
a
claim
of
that
sort
either
in
his
pleadings
or
at
any
later
stage
and
the
claim
that
evidence
might
dissipate
in
some
cases
is
we
submit
not
enough
to
require
in
oral
hearing
in
every
case.
even
in
cases
decided
under
the
speedy
trial
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
which
dissipation
of
the
evidence
and
in
which
the
possibility
of
prejudice
to
defense
is
oppressing
if
not
overriding
concern.
the
possibility
that
evidence
would
dissipate
is
not
sufficient.
dissipation
of
the
evidence
prejudiced
to
the
defense
is
a
matter
of
proof
at
very
minimum
it
is
a
matter
of
claim
and
its
not
sufficient
to
require
hearing
in
every
case
that
there
might
be
prejudice
in
some
cases,
if
that
happens
there
will
time
enough
to
correct
it
when
it
occurs.
finally
i
turn
to
petitioners
argument,
that
the
procedures
now
used
by
the
parole
commission
are
inadequate
to
guard
against
these
kinds
of
intervening
losses,
the
loss
of
possibility
of
concurrent
revocation,
the
loss
of
mitigating
evidence
doing
the
interim
and
so
on.
we
think
that
the
argument
has
little
to
recommend
it
,
commission
conducts
a
full
file
review
sets
an
oral
hearing,
wherever
it
appears
the
one
would
be
useful.
petitioner's
argument
those
quickly
boils
down
to
the
argument
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
in
every
case
even
when
it
does
not
seem
likely
to
serve
a
useful
purpose
in
a
particular
case.
we
start
in
this
regard
from
the
proposition
that
if
parolee
is
convicted
of
another
crime
while
on
parole
then
revocation
of
parole
to
begin
after
the
intervening
sentence
is
the
ordinary
disposition,
the
parole
commissions
rule
so
provide
and
that
is
rule
2.47c
which
we
reprinted
at
page
13(a)
of
our
brief.
what
the
commission
does
is
establish
a
file
review
and
essentially
require
the
parolee
to
bare
the
initial
burden
of
showing
that
he
should
receive
exceptional
treatment
and
that
an
oral
hearing
as
opposed
to
a
paper
file
review,
is
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
they
are
so.
we
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
that
comports
with
the
due
process
cause,
even
to
the
extent
something
is
required
in
the
interim.
the
interest
involved
for
parolee
are
slight
as
i
have
pointed
out
the
fact
of
incarceration
itself
is
not
a
state
because
that
was
determined
for
the
1971
murder
conviction.
the
parole
commission
has
ample
discretion
to
allow
concurrent
revocation,
retroactively
or
partial
concurrent
revocation
and
it
is
unlikely
for
someone
who
has
been
convicted
of
murder
will
show
that
he
is
entitled
to
exceptional
treatment,
but
putting
that
aside
its
clear
that
whatever
procedures
the
parole
commission
may
use
their
is
no
chance
of
an
erroneous
decision.
the
possibility
of
error
was
distinguished
by
the
conviction
for
murder.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
that
is
not
true.
that
question
was
raised
in
zerbst
against
kidwell,
the
decision
at
304
u.s.
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
an
identical
argument
was
made
in
this
court
unanimously
rejected
it.
after
a
prompt
intervening
hearing
there
is
no
need
for
concurrent
revocation.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
it
is
not
in
fact
what
happens.
my
understanding
and
we
have
been
informed
by
the
parole
commission
is
that
when
an
oral
depositional
hearing
is
held
during
intervening
conviction,
during
the
term
for
the
intervening
conviction
the
usual
disposition
is
to
make
no
deposition.
the
commission
takes
the
evidence
that
the
parolee
has
to
offer
and
makes
no
decision.
in
some
cases
it
makes
a
decision
to
lift
the
warrant
and
to
lift
the
detainer,
in
other
cases
it
makes
the
decision
to
revoke
concurrently
on
the
spot,
but
in
most
cases
it
makes
no
decision
at
all
and
the
court
that
has
discussed
this
problem
most
thoroughly,
the
court
of
appeals
in
jones
against
johnston
has
concluded
that
there
is
no
constitutional
or
statutory
obstacle
to
having
the
hearing
and
making
no
decision
and
we
believe
this
is
what
is
the
commission
would
continue
to
do.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
my
opponent
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
they
can
make
a
prompt
decision
to
revoke
and
at
the
same
time
make
the
decision
that
the
revocation
will
begin
after
the
conclusion
of
the
intervening
sentence.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
that
the
time
served
as
a
parole
violator
would
begin
after
the
intervening
sentence.
the
last
point
i
want
to
make
is
the
point
that
it
is
usually
thought
that
due
process
procedures
are
necessary
to
prevent
or
to
reduce
the
risk
of
erroneous
decision
making.
that
is
the
typology
this
court
setup
in
mathews
against
eldridge
but
in
a
case
like
this
we
think,
there
is
no
possibility
of
erroneous
decision
making,
an
exercise
of
discretion
maybe
unwise
and
maybe
uninformed,
and
not
be
erroneous.
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
excuse
me
your
honor.
if
this
man
--
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
yes
your
honor
it
might
have?..
mr.
frank
h.
easterbrook
your
honor,
there
is
no
way
that
the
possibility
of
error
can
be
excluded
on
supposition
of
that
sort.
but
as
the
court
said
in
mathews
against
eldridge,
the
possibility
that
kind
of
remote
possibility
of
error
in
a
few
cases
is
not
sufficient
to
call
for
hearings
in
every
case.
thank
you
very
much.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
