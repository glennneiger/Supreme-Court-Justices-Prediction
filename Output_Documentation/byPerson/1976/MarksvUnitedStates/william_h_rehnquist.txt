justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
solicitor
general
as
i
understand
the
state
of
the
law
on
this
particular
question
when
it
comes
here
from
the
sixth
circuit
the
government
had
this
case
and
another
court
of
appeals
decision
with
it,
several
other
courts
of
appeals
decisions
against
it.
don’t
you
think
the
solicitor
general
has
some
responsibility
under
the
adversary
system
when
there
is
a
plausible
argument
to
be
made
in
support
of
affirming
a
judgment
that
has
gone
in
favor
of
the
government
to
make
that
argument
rather
than
simply
adopt
what
he
thinks
is
the
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
you
saying
then
when
you
say
you
do
not
think
a
plausible
case
can
be
made
is
that
two
courts
of
appeals
presumably
consisting
of
judges
appointed
by
the
president
and
conformed
by
the
senate
have
reached
to
a
totally
implausible
result
that
the
government
is
unwilling
to
even
argue
in
favor
of
in
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
is
this
court
suppose
to
function
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
we
are
supposedly
the
beneficiaries
of
an
adversary
process
and
i
am
sure
we
would
look
with
great
skepticism.
mr.
smith
had
come
here
when
the
position
that
you
now
are
and
said
he
represented
his
clients
and
he
realized
he
had
a
couple
of
courts
of
appeals
cases
going
for
him
but
he
just
cuold
not
in
good
conscience
say
that
their
judgment
should
be
reversed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn’t
that
ultimately
the
reasonability
of
this
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
an
injustice
has
been
done
or
whether
or
not
a
particular
conviction
should
be
upheld
or
reversed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
we
best
served
by
an
adversary
presentation
in
making
that
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
might
have
been
a
good
idea
that
we
appointed
counsel
to
argue
in
your
state?
