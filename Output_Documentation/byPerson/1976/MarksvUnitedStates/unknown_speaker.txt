unknown
speaker
the
statute
has
always
remained
the
same,
hasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
repudiated
that
testimony
first
by
joining
the
chief
justice’s
opinion
in
miller
and
then
when
i
wrote
hamling.
unknown
speaker
that’s
not
binding
on
the
rest
of
us,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it’s
not
binding
on
him,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
what
are
you
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
but
justice
fortis
wasn’t
on
the
court
from
1966
all
the
way
till
1973,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
so
can
you
count
him
for
all
that
period
of
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
a
seven-man
majority?
unknown
speaker
well,
okay.
what
year
was
the
decision
in,
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
suggesting
that
it
subsisted
for
any
given
number
of
years
after
that.
unknown
speaker
now,
when
you
say
”should,”
are
you
telling
us
this
is
constitutionally
required?
unknown
speaker
what
provision
of
the
constitution
that
you
rely
on
to
say
that
it
must
be
viewed
by
the
appellate
court?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
your
clients
would
be
chilled
if
we
didn’t
look
at
these
movies.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
that
we
--
oh,
you
don’t
think
we
have
to
look
at
them.
unknown
speaker
why
was
it
necessary
for
the
court
of
appeals
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
granted
review.
now,
do
we
have
to
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn’t
a
legal
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
you
…
unknown
speaker
you
complain
about
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
look
at
it.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
don’t
look
at
it,
are
you
going
to
complain
about
us
not
looking
at
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
had
a
judge
on
the
court
of
appeals
who
was
blind
--
and
there
have
been
judges
in
state
and
federal
courts
who
were
blind
--
what
do
you
say
about
that?
can
that
vacuum
not
be
fulfilled
by
having
an
explicit
description
of
the
materials?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
some
of
the
jurors
were
from
outside
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky?
unknown
speaker
so
the
entire
jury
venire,
then,
was
drawn
from
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky?
unknown
speaker
which
is
not
part
of
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn’t
say
that;
i
said
the
entire
jury
venire
was
drawn
from
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
a
good
number
of
your
venire
came
from
metropolitan
cincinnati
on
the
kentucky
side.
unknown
speaker
well,
on
your
theory
on
jenkins,
that
if
a
person
lived
in
connecticut,
spent
three
days
a
week
there
as
so
many
of
them
do
and
spent
four
days
a
week
on
his
profession
or
business
in
new
york
city,
that
he
could
not
divorce
himself
from
the
off-broadway
standards,
off-broadway
show
standards.
is
that
the
general
idea?
unknown
speaker
i
could
understand
the
prosecution
making
that
argument.
i
am
a
little
…
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
quite
so
clear
about
your
making
it.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
argue
certainly
to
the
jury,
can’t
you,
that
covington
and
newport
are
part
of
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
and
that
the
people
who
lived
there
are
as
capable
of
contributing
to
the
standards
of
the
eastern
district
as
their
people
in
what
you
refer
to
as
appalachia.
unknown
speaker
we
will
resume
at
10:00
o’clock
in
the
morning,
counsel.
