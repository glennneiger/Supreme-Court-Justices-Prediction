justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
the
operators
of
a
movie
theater
in
newport
kentucky.
they
were
charged
with
transporting
obscene
materials
in
the
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
a
federal
statute.
the
alleged
violation
occurred
in
early
1973
before
our
decision
in
miller
against
california.
in
miller,
we
announced
new
standards
by
which
to
decide
whether
allegedly
obscene
materials
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
instructions
to
the
jury
in
this
case
were
based
on
miller
rather
than
prior
law.
since
the
conduct
had
issue
occurred
before
miller,
we
think
it
was
error
to
apply
the
miller
standards
retroactively.
we
would
not
influence
criminal
liability
if
a
conduct
not
punishable
under
the
earlier
standards.
we
therefore
reverse
the
convictions
and
remand
the
case.
mr.
justice
brennan
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined.
mr.
justice
stevens
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
