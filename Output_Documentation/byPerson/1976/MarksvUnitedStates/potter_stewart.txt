and
you
are

gather
from
reading
in
the
newspapers
in
some
more
cases
around

you
said

of
course
in
this
particular
case,
anybody
familiar
with
the
cincinnati
community
knows
that
newport,
kentucky
is
part
of
greater
cincinnati
and
that
is
the
community.

accepting
your
proposition
that
in
many
cases
it
would
be
difficult
and
lead
off
to
a
wild
goose
chase.
this
particular
case
it
really
is
not
for
anybody
familiar
with
the
greater
cincinnati
community.

the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
simply
is
not
a
community,

the
word
‘common’

justice

the
cincinnati
community
as
a
community
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
very
arguably
is
not
one,
it
is
the
residence
whether
its
borders
just
do
not,
by
a
sense
they
do
not
share
something
in
common
it
is
not
a
community.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
geographic
accident.
