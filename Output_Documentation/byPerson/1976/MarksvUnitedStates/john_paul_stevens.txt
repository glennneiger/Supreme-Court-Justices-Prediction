justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general
is
the
policy
of
confessing
error
when
you
find
there
is
no
intellectually
defensible
way
of
defending
the
result
below,
is
this
is
a
new
policy
that
the
solicitor
general’s
office
has
just
adopted
or
is
this
something
that’s
going
on
for
many,
many
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
know
whether
you
apply
a
different
standard
in
making
these
determinations
that
has
been
applied
in
the
past?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
consider
this
practice
of
your
office
different
from
the
practice
of
some
defense
counsel
from
time-to-time
of
filing
andrew’s
briefs?
is
it
not
true
that
defense
counsel
sometimes
feel
in
a
good
conscience
they
have
no
appealable
point
and
therefore
in
effect
it’s
so
acknowledged
to
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
professionally
is
there
any
difference
between
the
two
in
your
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
am
a
little
puzzled.
is
that
purpose
of
the
community
standard
to
draw
on
the
frame
of
reference
to
the
juror
normally
looks
to
such
as
the
district
from
which
the
venire
is
drawn
or
is
it
to
look
at
the
economic
market
in
which
the
challenged
film
is
exhibited,
which
would
be
the
more
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general
let
me
put
the
same
question
just
a
little
differently;
i
know
the
record
does
not
show
this
but
your
reference
to
the
antitrust
relevant-market
raised
a
question
in
my
mind.
supposing
the
evidence
here
included
a
market
study
which
show
that
everybody
who
attended
this
theater
was
a
resident
of
cincinnati;
would
you
then
say
that
the
kentucky
district
would
be
an
appropriate
prime
reference
to
judge
the
films?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
the
instruction
have
been
alright
under
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
you
are
saying
that
would
be
but
this
si
all
--
but
even
if
no
one
came
from
the
community
which
is
used
as
a
prime
reference,
you
would
say
that
will
still
comport
with...
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
one
who
is
out
of
films
that
are
challenged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
anybody
who
had
attended
the
theater
happened
to
become
across
the
river
from
cincinnati
on
the
night
that
they
received
just
to
take
an
extreme
example.
