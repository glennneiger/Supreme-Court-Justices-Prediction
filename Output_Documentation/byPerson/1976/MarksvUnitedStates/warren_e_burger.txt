chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
marks
against
the
united
states,
75-708.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
marks
against
united
states.
have
you
completed
your
presentation
mr.
smith,
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
at
your
position
mr.
solicitor
general
it
is
not
intended
to
tinge
upon
our
ultimate
authority
to
decide
the
cases,
the
way
you
decided.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
think
that
that
would
be
no
more
true
in
that
settings
and
it
would
be
to
say
that
arlington
is
part
of
the
metropolitan
washington
area.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
the
hypothesis,
one
that
could
not
be
supported
unless
you
had
someone
standing
outside
the
door
of
the
theaters
with
all
times
taking
senses
of
the
location
address
of
the
persons
entering
the
theater,
is
it
anything
that
can
be
determined
by
a
market
survey
the
way
we
determine
that
or
try
determine
it
in
antitrust
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general,
mr.
smith,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
statement
you
read
--
i
will
put
this
as
a
question
didn’t
deunt
that
statement
that
you
read
reflect
essentially
chief
justice
warren’s
expression
and
i
think
the
roth
and
memoirs’
case
that
there
can’t
realistically
be
any
such
thing
as
a
national
standard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
not
an
effort
to
define
a
standard
but
to
reflect
the
broad
general
proposition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-708,
marks
and
others
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
