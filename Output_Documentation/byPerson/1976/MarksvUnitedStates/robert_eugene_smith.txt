mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
that
arose
out
of
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
and
charged
charges
involved
the
obscenity
law,
conspiracy
to
violate
the
federal
obscenity
laws
1462
and
65.
the
conduct
occurred
beginning,
i
think,
a
period
back
in
1970
and
continued
theoretically
up
through
february
of
1973.
this
court,
in
june
of
1973,
enunciated
and
changed,
we
suggest,
what
was
the
prevailing
law
in
practice,
and
that
is
to
say,
the
standards
for
determining
obscenity
a
la
roth
memoirs.
and
the
counsel
herein
has
filed
in
its
petition
and
its
brief
the
argument
that
certainly
just
is
ex
post
facto
judicial
lawmaking,
the
change
that
occurred,
and
that
a
court
should
not
have
used
the
miller
test
for
conduct
which
occurred
prior
to
the
miller
test.
it
had
been,
we
suggest,
the
law
in
practice
and
generally
understood,
although
this
court
had
not
so
articulated
it,
that
there
were
three
elements.
this
is
what
mr.
justice
brennan
in
essence
set
forth
in
his
memoirs
decision.
in
fact,
even
at
one
point
when
justice
rehnquist,
who
was
appearing
before
a
house
committee
to
testify
regarding
the
views
on
some
obscenity
laws,
discussed
the
fact
that
there
seemed
to
be
the
obscenity
law
today
had
three
elements
to
it,
although
he
did
say
that
the
last
part
of
the
test
--
that
is
to
say,
the
”utterly
without
social
value”
test
--
had
only
been
joined
in
by
justices
brennan,
fortis
and
chief
justice
warren.
but
he
suggests
that
until
this
court
said
something
else
that
it
was
going
to
be
followed
by
the
lower
appellate
courts
and
the
lower
federal
courts
of
the
country,
and
in
fact
that
wasn’t
what
occurred.
i
think
in
the
solicitor
general’s
brief
and
response
and
the
seeming
suggestion
of
confession
of
error,
he
indicates
that
all
of
the
appellate
courts
that
had
occasion
to
consider
this
decision
did
so
in
light
of
the
roth
memoirs
test
and
thus
it
sort
of
had
become
the
law
in
practice.
the
sixth
circuit,
without
viewing
the
films
in
question,
found
that
the
particular
material
obscene,
they
said,
under
either
test.
and
of
course,
that
was
a
matter
to
which
judge
mccrate
dissented.
and
so
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
roth
memoirs
test
was
the
law
in
practice.
it
was
assumed
to
be
the
law
in
practice
--
by
defendants,
by
courts,
the
lower
appellate
courts,
state
courts,
federal
courts
all
across
the
country,
even
though
this
court
had
not
so
articulated
it
--
and
that
there
came
a
time
when
this
court
did
articulate
new
standards,
and
that
was,
of
course,
in
june
of
1973.
so
all
of
the
conduct
for
which
misters
marks
and
monet
and
the
associate
members
of
their
group
were
charged
occurred
prior
to
this
court’s
enunciation
of
the
new
test.
and
we
say
that
based
on
the
law,
the
bouie
versus
city
of
columbia
and
the
other
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
our
briefs,
that
obviously
this
is
an
expansion,
this
is
a
judicial
gloss,
this
is
a
change,
this
is
a
detriment
that
has
occurred
to
the
defendants
and,
thus,
they
should
not
be
held
accountable
and
chargeable
under
that
more
severe
test,
certainly
severe
as
to
the
defendants.
and
we
say
that
in
this
context,
the
court
erred
in
not
allowing
us
to
have
the
case
tried
under
the
roth
memoirs
standard
and,
thus,
erred
in
not
allowing
us
to
have
expert
witnesses
or
other
testimony
which
would
have
elucidated
evidence
in
light
of
the
roth
memoirs
standard.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
statute
has
remained
the
same,
in
fact,
that
is
correct.
the
statute
has
remained
the
same,
it
has
not
changed;
however,
as
you
had
occasioned,
sir,
when
you
testified
before
the
house
committee,
i
think
and
on
page
430
of
the
report
of
the
hearings
for
subcommittee
no.
3,
i
think
your
honor
opted
for
the
fact
it
was
better
to
have
a
general
definition
of
obscenity
than
to
have
a
more
restrictive
definition.
i
think
you
said,
“mr.
chairman,
i
think
we
have
the
same
reservations
as
mr.
holly
expressed.
the
extremely
detailed
definition
of
sexual
conduct,
sexual
excitement
and
sadomasochistic
abuse
seems
less
desirable
than
the
more
general
phraseology
found
in
the
administration
bill.”
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
but
i
am
saying
before
miller,
this
is,
of
course,
the
concept
that
we
all
had,
and
even
your
honor
at
that
time
was
expressing
the
concept
of
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
of
course
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
relying
on
the
fact
that
roth
memoirs
was,
in
fact,
the
test
and
that
this
was
a
judicial
gloss
that
changed
things.
well,
we
think,
your
honor,
we
take
in
essence
by
adding
up
figures,
we
think
we
can
come
up
to
seven
justices,
if
i
may.
first,
we
have
mr.
justice
brennan
and
joined
by
chief
justice
warren
and
fortis,
who
made
two
significant
modifications
in
the
previous
roth
standard
and
that
this,
in
essence,
became
a
law
in
practice
from
1966
to
1973,
because
justice
black,
douglas
and
justice
stewart
agreed
and
could
be
counted
upon
to
reach
the
same
result,
but
for
different
reasons.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no
sir,
he
was
not.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
but
when
we
took
justices
douglas
and
black,
who
say
that
there
are
no
laws,
justice
stewart
who
says
only
hard-core
and
justice
harlan
who
says
in
federal
cases
only
hard-core
is
applicable,
then
i
think
we
are
dealing
with
a
majority,
a
clear
majority.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
i
say
if
you
added
that
group,
i
think
that
at
the
time
of
the
decision
in
memoirs,
we
are
talking
about
…
adding
the
figures
up,
we
are
talking
about
approximately
seven
justices.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
1966.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
has
not
changed;
it
has
become
the
law
in
practice,
as
enunciated
by
every
federal
appellate
court
in
the
country
and
almost
every
state
appellate
court
in
the
country.
roth
memoirs
was
thought
to
be
the
law.
and
as
i
said,
your
honor,
even
with
the
department
of
justice
--
and
i
agree
that
it's
not
binding
and
any
solicitor
general’s
brief
on
the
matter
is
not
binding
--
certainly,
it
appeared
to
be
the
law
of
the
land
upon
which
defendants
would
rely
in
governing
their
conduct
so
as
not
to
offend
the
federal
criminal
laws.
and
we
say
that
what
occurred
certainly
was
in
connection
with
the
court’s
enunciation
of
the
standards
in
miller,
the
court
suggests
that
this
is
the
first
time
since
roth
the
court
majority
has
been
able
to
agree
upon
the
formulation
of
standards.
mr.
justice
burger
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
roth
memoirs
test
was,
at
least
for
the
state
of
california,
correctly
regarded
as
the
appropriate
test
at
the
time
the
conduct
was
committed.
and
so
we
again
say
that
defendants
have
the
right
to
rely
on
that
particular
factor;
and
because
of
the
change
in
law
in
miller,
which
occurred
after
the
conduct
involved
here,
we
certainly
think
that
our
clients
certainly
in
the
procedure
of
due
process
are
entitled
to
this
aspect
of
constitutional
protection.
our
second
argument
primarily
directs
itself
to
the
failure
of
the
appellate
court
to
review
the
movies
in
question.
in
this
instance,
two
of
the
judges
looked
at
the
affidavits
in
support
of
the
search
warrants
and
made
their
conclusion
that
this
was
hard-core
pornography.
unfortunately,
hard-core
pornography
is
not
a
talisman
that
says
that
anything
that
is
hard-core
pornography
is,
in
and
of
itself,
obscene.
else-wise,
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
for
this
court,
through
justice
burger’s
decision,
to
enunciate
three
definitive
aspects
of
what
is
to
be
used
to
define
material
that
can
be
condemned
as
obscene.
so
the
appellate
court
refused
to
look
at
the
film.
we
feel
that
they
should
have
looked
at
the
film.
it
is
the
responsibility,
it's
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
and
we
suggest
that
they
erred
in
avoiding
their
duty
to
look
at
the
film
and
that
they
should
be
required
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
suggest,
your
honor,
given
the
fact
that
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
as
enunciated
by
this
court,
we
do
feel
that
they
had
the
responsibility
to
look
at
the
material
and
determine
not
just
the
normal
question
of
whether
the
material
is
like
a
finding
of
fact
that
would
not
otherwise
be
reviewed,
a
jury
finding.
i
think
justice
clark
took
that
position
in
earlier
cases,
particularly,
in
the
memoirs
case;
but
it
was
never
joined
in
by
other
members
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
draw
our
strength,
if
we
may,
on
the
number
of
the
first
amendment
that
say
that
this
is
necessary
to
avoid
chilling
that
may
occur
in
a
particular
region
because
an
appellate
court
or
a
particular
jurisdiction
--
because
a
court
in
that
jurisdiction
may
be
more
conservative
perhaps,
more
narrow
in
its
point
of
view,
and
i
think
it’s
important,
at
least
within
the
region,
that
the
appellate
courts
be
required
to
assert
the
responsibility
to
examine.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
well,
it’s
not
just
our
clients
being
chilled,
and
i’m
not
suggesting
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
am
suggesting
that
there
would
be
a
chilling
effect
on
other
things,
not
just
my
clients,
your
honor.
i
am
arguing
for
a
broader
approach,
and
i
am
not
saying
that
you
all
should
look
at
them.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
didn’t
say
that
in
this
case
for
the
resolution
of
these
issues
that
it
was
necessary
for
this
court
to
look
at
these
films.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
because
this
is
a
discretionary
review
on
the
part
of
your
honor
and
your
honors
as
to
whether
or
not
you
decide
to
grant
a
review
in
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir,
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
for
the
resolution
of
the
arguments
in
this
case,
because
i
think
these
are
legal
arguments.
the
question
of
whether
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
we
weren’t
permitted,
the
court
refused
to
look
at
it.
we
argued
to
them,
we
said
you
must
review.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
did
not
look
at
it.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
i
am
not,
because
i
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
to
the
resolution
of
these
three
issues.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir,
but
an
explicit
description
of
the
materials
accompanied
by
the
soundtrack,
to
which
he
could
listen,
and
not,
we
suggest,
the
possible
prejudice
involving
an
fbi
agent
who
is
trying
to
get
a
search
warrant
and
who
may
not
discuss
the
potential
serious,
literary,
artistic
values
that
may
exist.
so
i
do
think,
yes,
in
a
different
kind
of
environment
with
a
neutral
--
it’s
like
a
translator
in
a
court,
your
honor.
if
someone
speaks
greek
and
he
is
coming
up
for
trial,
the
court
will
arrange
certainly,
if
possible,
if
a
witness
or
a
defendant
is
involved,
to
get
a
translator;
but
it’s
approved
by
the
court.
it’s
not
somebody
who
is
working
in
the
prosecutor’s
office
who
says,
“oh,
well,
i
can
come
and
do
it.”
so
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
there
are
probably
ways
that
that
can
be
accomplished;
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
through
the
affidavit
of
the
fbi
agent
in
this
particular
regard.
and
so
we
feel
that
the
it
becomes
necessary
and
there
is
certainly
a
conflict
in
the
circuit.
we
think
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
resolve
this
issue
that
at
least
at
the
appellate
level
we
should
get
a
complete
review
of
the
law
and
certainly
the
facts
as
are
required.
the
third
point
to
which
i
address
myself,
which
is
a
matter
that
is
in
controversy
between
the
solicitor
general
and
myself,
relates
to
the
consent
of
contemporary
community
standards.
the
court
over
and
over
again
in
its
charge
to
the
jury
suggested
or
said
that
the
jury
was
to
take
the
concept
to
community
standards
as
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
now,
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky,
the
jurors
are
not
all
drawn
from
the
eastern
district.
those
which
sit
in
covington
are
drawn
from
the
contiguous
counties
around
covington.
then
if
there
is
a
court
sitting
in
frankfort,
they’re
drawn
from
around
there,
and
if
it
is
sitting
in
gatlinburg,
kentucky
down
along
the
west
virginia
line,
they’re
drawn
from
there.
but
the
court
did
not
delineate
or
limit
it
to
the
area
from
which
the
jury
itself
came,
but
to
the
entire
eastern
district,
relying
in
their
concept
on
the
words
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
hamling
case.
we
opted
for
something
different.
we
opted
for
primarily
a
standard
that
would
encompass
the
contemporary
community
that
would
include
the
cincinnati
area.
we
suggested
that
through
the
voir
dire
process
that
at
least
half
of
the
jurors
worked
or
their
significant
others
or
spouses
worked
in
the
covington
area.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
i
said
all
of
jurors
were
from
the
area
contiguous
to
covington.
half
of
the
jurors
or
their
significant
others
or
spouses
worked
in
covington
and
cincinnati.
they
lived
in
the
residency
in
kentucky,
but
they
worked
in
cincinnati.
there
is
a
whole
social
intercourse
primarily
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
from
the
area
contiguous
to
covington.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it
is
part
of
it,
but
not
from
the
entire
eastern
district.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct.
and
as
i
said,
we
could
stand
on
the
courthouse
steps
in
covington
and
you
could
see
cincinnati
across
the
river.
the
newspapers
are
published
in
cincinnati.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that
is
correct,
but
the
judge
said
they
must
disregard,
in
essence,
by
only
using
the
eastern
district,
they
must
disregard
the
cincinnati
area,
and
we
felt
that
that
was
grossly
unfair
in
view
of
--
and
we
opt,
really,
more
than
anything
else
for
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
said
in
essence
in
jenkins,
and
that
is,
without
a
definition
of
a
geographical
standard,
but
just
using
community
in
the
general
sense,
which
i
think
was
one
of
import
of
the
holding
in
the
jenkins
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
sir,
i
think
it
is
not
from
this
standpoint,
if
i
may.
newport,
where
the
film
was
shown,
is
just
right
across
the
river
from
cincinnati.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
because
i
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
your
honor,
this
is
the
only
adult
theatre
in
the
whole
eastern
district
of
kentucky;
but
there
were
adult
theaters
and
there
were
adult
bookstores
in
cincinnati,
and
if
you
are
going
to
talk
about
the
level
of
tolerance
and
the
community
standard,
we
certainly
are
opting
to
have
the
larger
community,
that
is
to
say,
the
metropolitan
community,
included
to
make
it
meaningful.
and
that’s
why
i
would
have
preferred
certainly
had
the
judge
given
the
charge
of
the
contemporary
community
standards
without
defining
a
geographical
limit
so
that
we
could
have
argued
to
the
jury
about
what
is
the
community,
what
is
the
definition
of
the
community
and
made
it,
we
suggest,
more
meaningful.
but
when
the
judge
says
that
you
must
consider
the
standards
of
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
and
that’s
the
entire
district,
not
just
from
where
the
jury
is
drawn,
and
you
consider
that
most
of
eastern
district
is
appalachia,
we
are
not
dealing
with
anything
that
is
meaningful
in
terms
of
these
defendants
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
true;
but
we
also
opted,
as
i
said,
because
cincinnati
did
have,
that
is
sort
of
was
more
the
cultural
level,
the
cultural
center,
the
center
in
terms
of
entertainment
industry
and
such
like
that,
that
that
became
a
relevant
part
of
the
standard.
and
so
we
felt
that
it
was
extremely
important
that
the
jury
be
allowed
to
consider
that
of
which
they
knew,
whatever
they
knew
about
that
community
standard,
to
be
incorporated
in
part
of
the
whole
in
this
particular
regard.
so
for
that
reason,
we
moved
to
ask
that
the
community
be
enlarged.
now,
there
was
some
evidence
that
was
educed
by
some
of
the
experts
in
cross-examination
and
direct
examination
regarding
their
background
and
that
they
were
basing
their
opinions
in
part
upon
what
occurred
in
other
places;
but
the
jury
was
effectively
precluded
from
considering
that
by
virtue
of
the
court’s
instructions
regarding
the
eastern
district,
and
we
were
effectively
precluded
from
presenting
evidence
of
the
materials,
of
the
community
…
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
briefly
the
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
in
miller
v.
california
the
opinion
authored
by
the
chief
justice
talked
on
page
32
in
part,
it
is
neither
realistic
nor
constitutionally
sound
to
read
the
first
amendment
is
requiring
that
the
people
of
maine
or
mississippi
accept
public
depiction
of
conduct
found
tolerable
in
las
vegas
or
new
york
city
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say
people
in
different
states
vary
in
their
tastes
and
attitudes
and
this
diversity
is
not
to
be
strangled
by
the
absolutism
of
imposed
uniformity.
we
suggest
that
by
carving
out
an
artificial
district
and
saying
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
that
is
in
effect
what
courts
are
doing
and
we
suggest
ignoring
what
i
think
the
words
of
this
court
were
in
miller,
i
think
that
the
concept
of
jenkins
was
a
sound
one
that
is
to
say
talking
in
general
terms
to
the
community
that
where
their
social
intercourse
occurs,
where
the
people
feel
a
sense
of
belonging
to
the
community,
but
to
say
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
as
broad
as
it
is
geographically,
and
it
is
broad
as
it
is
an
attitude,
we
suggest
there
is
an
improper
uniform
standard
that
is
just
too
absolute
and
should
be
rejected
in
this
instance.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
think
that
it
does
but
it
is
your
word,
it
is
the
chief
justice
hear
words
suggesting
that
you
are
making
a
contrast
between
states
and
between
cities;
it
is
not
all
as
broad
as
all
states.
record
do
not
say
the
people
of
maine
or
mississippi
versus
las
vegas
and
new
york
state,
it
talked
about
states
versus
cities
and
we
think
that…
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
the
court
did
go
on
to
say
that
because
of
the
variation
the
people
should
not
be
strangled
by
the
imposition
of
an
absolute
standard
in
terms
of
--
i
read
it
to
mean
an
absolute
geographical
standard,
and
i
say
that
that
is
what
i
find
intolerable
here.
of
course,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
his
argument
or
his
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
hamling
case
did
allow
the
court
suggest
the
trial
judge
would
have
some
discretion
in
allowing
evidence
of
community
standards
in
communities
other
than
that
from
where
the
jury
is
sitting.
mr.
justice
stevens
asked
about
the
concept
of
the
community
standard
in
terms
of
a
market
research
program
where
you
find
out
that
everybody
came
from
another
community.
well,
there
are
cases
that
are
working
that
way
up
in
the
federal
system
where
the
films,
let
us
say,
is
delivered
from
california
to
memphis,
tennessee
and
it
has
never
been
shown
to
memphis,
tennessee,
it
was
not
designed
to
be
shown
in
memphis,
tennessee,
absolutely
no
evidence
that
it
had
anything
more
than
it
touch
that
area
from
the
standpoint
distribution,
now
what
community
do
we
put
there
and
the
concept
that
we
put
the
community
from
which
it
came,
the
community
where
it
was
intended
to
be
shown
and
if
you
are
going
to
put
geographical
limits,
you
are
going
to
have
these
problems
that
present
themselves.
so,
i
think
it
is
not
just
philosophical
in
answering
mr.
justice
stevens’
question,
there
are
cases
where
there
is
no
showing
that
the
film
has
ever
been
depict,
didn’t
exhibit
in
that
community,
none
whatsoever.
that
is
the
community
standard
that
has
been
employed.
and
so
with
that
i
averse.
thank
you!
