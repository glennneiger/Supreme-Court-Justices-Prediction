mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
become
apparent
by
now
the
government
has
confessed
here
on
two
of
the
three
issues
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that’s
it
is
clear,
we
require
to
do
so
and
i
will
explain
why,
briefly.
the
prosecution
here
took
place
of
course
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
miller
against
california,
but
it
was
for
conduct
that
it
occurred
prior
to
the
miller
decision.
that
was
in
a
time
when
the
governing
law
in
this
area
was
that
announced
in
roth
against
united
states
as
substantially
modified
by
memoirs
against
massachusetts.
in
a
word
petitioners
acted
at
the
time
when
the
law
required
that
their
materials,
their
film
would
be
shown
to
the
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value.
but
the
jury
was
charged
under
the
miller
standard
which
requires
that
the
work
taken
as
a
whole
lacks
serious
literary,
artistic,
political,
or
scientific
value.
but
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
standards
as
evident
that
was
recognized
in
the
miller
decision
itself
in
the
miller
opinion
itself
which
said
that
memoirs
represented
the
sharp
break
with
roth
and
that
was
recognized
again
in
hamling
against
united
states.
it
is
also
clear
that
miller
represented
a
swing
back
towards
the
real
understanding
of
the
roth
decision,
although
it
refined
the
roth
standards
greatly,
and
it
seems
clear
therefore
the
petitioners
who
tried
under
a
standard
that
gave
the
prosecution
less
of
a
burden,
considerable
less
of
a
burden
and
the
law
provided
at
the
time
they
acted.
it
has
been
suggested
to
the
test
annunciated
by
the
three
justices
in
memoirs,
it
never
became
the
law
because
it
never
commanded
the
adherence
of
the
majority
of
this
court.
therefore,
it
is
said
roth
remained
the
law
and
since
miller
is
like
roth
petitioners
just
got
the
jury
instruction
they
were
entitled
towards
something
close
to
it.
that
argument
i
must
say,
unhappily
seems
to
be
not
the
whole
twater.
if
the
memoirs
plurality
was
not
the
law
than
one
of
two
things
would
follow
and
i
think
either
it
is
inadmissible,
either
there
was
no
law
at
all
between
the
memoirs
and
miller
in
which
case
there
would
be
no
places
for
any
prosecution
of
conduct
occurring
during
those
eight
years
or
roth
remained
the
law
despite
the
fact
that
any
conviction
obtained
under
roth
would
be
reversed
because
three
justices
hearing
to
memoirs
and
two
justices
thought
that
no
obscenity
conviction
could
standup.
moreover,
in
redrup
against
new
york
and
the
cases
thereafter
up
to
miller
this
court
reviewed
allegedly
obscene
materials
on
the
basis
of
the
different
views
of
the
justices
and
reversed
it
over
30
cases.
so
it
is
plained
that
there
was
law
during
that
period
and
i
think
it
is
plained
therefore
that
it
consistent
effectively
of
the
plurality
opinion
in
memoirs.
moreover,
i
think
that
the
opinion
in
hamling
against
united
states
would
sustain
their
conviction
where
pre-miller
conduct
also
shows
that
roth
memoirs
was
the
law
during
the
period.
now
even
though
that
is
court
made
law,
it
is
effectively
read
into
the
statute
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
anyway
that
a
charge
of
the
change
that
occurred
in
miller
can
retroactively
be
applied
to
these
petitioners
that
would
deny
them
due
process
of
law.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
tried
to
distinguish
bouie
against
city
of
columbia
and
i
do
not
think
the
principle
of
these
two
cases
can
be
distinguished
because
here
miller
relaxed
the
constitutional
rules
which
had
previously
been
applied
and
that
has
the
effect
which
is
indistinguishable
from
reading
a
statute
to
cover
conduct
which
it
previously
did
not
cover,
and
for
that
reason,
the
government
face
a
petitioner
entitled
to
a
new
trial
with
a
properly
instructed
jury.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
indeed
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
we
have
considered
this
case,
this
principle
for
at
least
three
years
now
and
if
i
thought
there
were
a
plausible
case
to
be
made
for
applying
miller
standards
to
pre-miller
conduct
i
would
certainly
make
that
argument.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that
in
the
fact
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
those
courts
of
appeals
quite
unfortunately
from
my
point
of
view
because
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
argue
to
uphold
these
convictions
and
i
deplore
the
waste
of
resources
that
has
gone
in
this
prosecution
must
now
be
re-prosecuted
but
nothing
in
those
courts
of
appeals
mr.
justice
rehnquist
opinions
gave
me
any
--
i
thought
any
intellectually
defensible
way
to
defend
the
convictions
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
the
answer
can
only
be
that
the
government
feels
it
has
an
obligation
not
only
to
the
adversary
process
but
also
to
the
law
and
to
justice.
in
the
case
where
it
thinks
an
injustice
has
been
done
and
that
there
is
no
intellectually
defensible
way
of
supporting
the
conviction
i
think
the
government
must
say
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
indeed,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
trust
we
also
have
an
obligation
to
the
court
to
tell
it
when
we
think
there
is
no
adversary
case
that
can
be
made
that
has
been
done
many
times
by
the
solicitor
general’s
office
and
there
have
been
occasions
when
the
confession
of
error
has
been
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
certainly
not
so
intended
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
am
certain
it
will
not
have
an
effect.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
is
going
on
since
memory
of
man
runneth
not
to
the
contrary.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
i
apply
the
standard
that
most
of
the
solicitor
general
had
applied
but
some
deviated.
my
standard
is
that
if
the
government
has
a
respectable
position
i
will
defend
it
regardless
of
my
personal
views
of
the
matter.
my
personal
views
in
this
case
are
that
i
would
dearly
love
to
defend
this
conviction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
the
private
board
does
that
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
there
is
less,
if
i
may
say,
there
is
no
difference
in
the
professional
obligation,
i
think
the
government
obviously
has
slightly
less
pressure
than
some
members
that
private
board
may
feel,
but
i
think
there
is
no
difference
ultimately
in
the
obligation
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
recall
of
him
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
not
heard.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
am
aware
of
the
reaction
of
the
courts,
i
am
also
aware
of
the
reactions
from
united
states
attorneys,
i
have
been
made
aware
of
that.
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
me
i
have
an
obligation
to
do
this
and
unpleasant
maybe
for
me
and
for
the
court
and
the
us
attorney,
i
do
do
it.
three
years
ago,
i
decided
that
this
was
the
rule
of
law
and
communicated
that
fact.
unfortunately
that
decision
was
not
communicated
apparently
to
united
states
attorneys.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
might
have
been
mr.
justice
rehnquist
we
confessed
error
in
the
brief,
so
that
i
think
it
comes
as
no
surprise
at
all
that
we
would
take
disposition
here
this
morning.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
yes,
there
are
some
prosecutions
for
example
in
memphis
which
will
be
affected
by
this.
i
think
our
position
on
that
is
adequately
explained
by
what
i
have
said
and
adequately
explained
in
our
brief.
i
reiterate
that
were
there
an
argument
to
be
made
the
other
way,
in
my
opinion
i
would
gladly
make
it.
i
think
the
remaining
two
points
are
rather
simpler.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
required
as
a
statutory
matter.
i
don’t
think
the
constitutional
question
need
to
be
reached
but
it
was
required
as
a
statutory
matter
to
look
at
these
materials.
now
there
are
undoubtedly
cases
in
which
that
is
not
true
but
here
that
was
really
almost
no
descriptive
matter
in
the
record
about
the
nature
of
these
films
except
that
contained
in
the
affidavit
made
by
an
fbi
agent
in
obtaining
a
search
warrant
an
ex
parte
statement
not
subject
to
cross-examination,
not
required
to
put
the
matters
in
context
so
that
if
there
was
to
be
any
effective
appellate
review
in
this
case,
i
think
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
required
to
look
at
the
materials.
there
maybe
cases
in
which
there
is
stipulation,
there
maybe
cases
in
which
the
testimony
is
sufficient
without
viewing
the
materials,
but
in
this
case
neither
of
those
is
true.
28
u.
s.
c.
1291
provides
appeals
and
that
takes
up
all
issues
that
are
properly
preserved
and
i
don’t
see
how
that
could
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
record
here
except
by
viewing
the
films.
now
i
do
not
--
we
have
said
in
our
brief
that
normally
that
is
sufficient
and
there
is
no
need
for
this
court
to
review
such
materials
unless
they
specifically
take
the
case
up
in
order
to
do
so.
petitioners
--
and
i
am
relieved
i
may
say,
they
come
to
a
point
where
i
disagree
with
the
petitioners.
i
have
argued
that
the
federal
court’s
instruction
to
the
jury
to
assess
the
films
in
accordance
to
contemporary
standards
of
the
community
standards
generally
help
throughout
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
was
erroneous
because
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
to
apply
standards
of
the
cincinnati
metropolitan
area
from
which
where
some
of
them
live
and
some
of
them
worked.
i
should
say
that
their
argument
does
not
support
that
conclusion
because
the
cincinnati
metropolitan
area
certainly
is
no
more
relevant
in
any
sense
than
is
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
the
jurors
here
did
not
live
throughout
the
cincinnati
metropolitan
area
anymore
than
they
live
throughout
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
moreover,
they
withdrawn
from
a
pool
which
had
a
widespread
geographic
distribution
of
available
jurors.
if
the
panel
did
not
have
widespread
distribution,
petitioners
would
have
liked,
certainly
no
objection
was
made
to
that
at
the
time.
but
i
think
in
any
event,
i
don’t
think
our
objection
would
have
been
availing
nor
do
i
think
it
should
have
been.
the
issue
is
simply
not
one
of
constitutional
dimensions.
the
hamling
decision
indicates
that
normally
the
relevant
community
will
be
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
trial
took
place.
jenkins
against
georgia
referred
to
an
instruction
which
it
did
not
disapprove
of
which
mainly
referred
to
community
standards
without
defining
the
community.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
without
disapproval
i
said.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
many
referred
to
mr.
justice
stewart
without
disapproval.
i
think
these
cases
could
easily
be
made
absolutely
impossible
if
every
obscenity
conviction
involved,
prosecution
involved
a
search
for
the
single
relevant
community.
there
are
endless
numbers
possibly
relevant
communities,
suburb
cities,
countryside,
one
could
define
in
a
way
and
one
can
turn
these
into
a
search
for
the
definition
of
the
relevant
community
which
would
make
market
definition
and
an
antitrust
case
looks
simple.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
i
do
not
know
why
jurors
who
do
not
live
throughout
the
greater
cincinnati
community.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
throughout
the
cincinnati.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
in
the
metropolitan
area,
i
understand
that
but
i
was
--
equally
lives
in
houston
district
and
i
would
suppose
there
maybe
variations
in
community
standards
throughout
the
metropolitan
area
in
cincinnati
just
as
there
maybe
throughout
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
take
it
that
would
be
true
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
the
point
of
the
relevant
community
or
the
community
which
standard
in
the
constitutional
sense
is
that
the
main
function
of
requiring
a
reference
to
community
standards
is
to
give
the
jurors
some
standard
extrinsic
to
themselves
to
which
they
may
refer
to
attempt
and
so
far
as
the
law
can
by
instructions
in
any
jury
case
to
make
sure
that
the
peculiar
or
perhaps
idiosyncratic
sensibilities
of
individual
jurors
does
not
control
the
case,
but
that
the
juror
is
referred
to
a
wider
community
and
in
that
sense
i
think
that
function
which
is
the
main
function
i
think
of
that
standard
was
served
here
by
this
instruction,
as
well
as
it
could
have
been
by
choosing
another
possibly
relevant
community.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
economic
market
mr.
justice
stevens
i
am
not
--
i
think
the
primary
function
is
to
refer
the
juror
to
something
outside
his
own
sensibilities.
secondarily,
it
is
to
provide
him
with
the
community
with
which
he
is
more
or
less
familiar
and
to
have
that
community
surrounding
the
area
in
which
the
films
are
shown,
and
like
all
of
those
functions
were
served
here
by
this
instruction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
of
course
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice…
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
suppose
in
some
sense
mr.
justice
stewart
so
is
the
state
of
california.
a
geographic
accident
certainly
it
contains
within
itself
widely
disparate
kinds
of
communities
and
an
instruction
applying
california-wide
community
standards
has
been
upheld
by
this
court.
in
jenkins
against
georgia
a
reference
simply
to
community
standards
without
defining
which
community
would
buy.
hamling
of
course
suggests
that
normally
it
will
be
the
judicial
district
from
which
the
venire
comes
which
will
provide
the
community
standards.
i
have
no
desire
to
say
that
there
is
in
a
case
any
single
community
which
controls
and
i
think
indeed
would
impossible
if
that
were
the
rule.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
would
it
be
inappropriate?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
would
have
been
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
also
would
have
been
possible
to
use
the
cincinnati
metropolitan
area
as
a
community.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
do
not
know;
no
one
come…
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
you
mean
to
say
that
although
the
films
were
shown
in
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
take
a
more
extreme
example
i
suppose
ever
that
people
always
do,
that
is
a
big
question
that
seems
to
me
to
drive
us
to
the
element
question
of
what
the
obscenity
laws
are
designed
to
do?
i
think
one
answer
would
suggest
that
eastern
district
of
kentucky
was
not
the
proper
area
that
is
obscenity
laws
in
some
part
are
intended
to
control
the
effect
of
the
obscenity
upon
the
people
who
view
it.
but
there
is
a
second
function
of
the
obscenity
laws,
which
is
i
think
the
sense
of
outrage
and
moral
disapproval
in
a
sense
that
something
is
going
on
in
their
community
of
which
they
deeply
disapprove
even
if
none
of
them
actually
go
to
the
theater,
and
in
that
function
of
the
obscenity
laws
which
i
think
is
a
legitimate
one,
would
suggest
that
you
might
use
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
even
if
nobody
from
that
district
came
there.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
it
is
quite
right
it
could
not
as
a
practical
matter
be
done.
moreover,
i
would
doubt
very
much
that
nobody
from
further
out
in
the
eastern
district
ever
goes
to
these
films,
but
i
took
it
to
be
a
question
designed
to
probe
the
philosophical
underpinning
of
my
argument,
and
i
have
just
responded
with
such
philosophical
underpinning
as
i
can
muster.
i
have
no
further
statement
to
make
in
the
case.
