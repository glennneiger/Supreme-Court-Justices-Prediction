how
do
you
reconcile
your
answer
to
justice
blackmun’s
question
with
mathews
v.
lucas
that
we
decided
last
term?
unknown
speaker
but
it
differentiated
legitimate
from
illegitimate
children,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
burden
is
naked
exclusion
here,
is
there,
mr.
weill?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
something
--
what
if
the
parents
marry?
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
do
not
marry
and
he
acknowledges?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
talking
about
is
a
recent
federal
statute,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
that
requires
a
recipient.
unknown
speaker
i
am
saying,
this
is
if
a
husband
deserts
a
marriage
situation
that
husband
deserts,
there
is
now
an
obligation
to
seek
support,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
this
is.
unknown
speaker
oh
they
were
not,
but
i
mean
that
is
the
same
statute.
unknown
speaker
also,
federal
court
sees
to
it,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
these
parents
were
living
together,
weren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
“invidious
private
intent”?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
inaccurate,
but
i
think
you
used
the
word
“invidious”.
is
there
anything
wrong
if
a
father
in
fact
decides
to
make
that
choice
as
between
illegitimate
and
legitimate
offspring?
unknown
speaker
in
what
cases
did
we
use
the
word
“invidious”?
unknown
speaker
maybe
an
after-born
child
has
some
rights.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
do
not
know
why
the
karas
case
did
not
come
here.
that
was
a
much
larger
estate.
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
suggestion
that
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
appeal?
unknown
speaker
as
the
parties
here,
deta
is
the
illegitimate
child.
unknown
speaker
jessie
is
the
mother,
and
joseph
roosevelt
gordon
is
the
mother’s
father,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
father
of
the
decedent.
unknown
speaker
but
joseph
gordon
is
one,
a
member
of
the
class,
another
member
of
which
you
represent.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weill,
are
you
familiar
with
the
expression
“illegitimi
non
carborundum”?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
has
nay
application
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
your
opponent
argued
rather
forcefully
that
labine
is
not
as
strong
a
case
as
in
fact
as
this.
do
you
want
to
respond
to
that
at
all?
i
think
it’s
really
critical.
