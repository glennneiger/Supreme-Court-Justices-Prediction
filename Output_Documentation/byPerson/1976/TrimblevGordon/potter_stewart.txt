doesn’t
the
court
have
to
presume
that
the
legislation
enacted
by
a
state
legislature
represents
the
public
policy
of
that
state?
i
do
not
know
of
what
importance
it
is
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
the
law
of
illinois
is
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
people
of
illinois.
it
does
not
reflect
the
public
policy
espoused
by
the
majority
of
people
of
illinois.
as
i
say,
i
do
not
really
know
what
materiality
or
relevance
that
has,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
it
has
and
whenever
it
had
became
material,
then
the
court
would
have
to
presume
that
a
law
enacted
by
a
state
legislature
does
in
fact
represent
the
policy
views
of
the
people
of
that
state
until
a
law
is
amended.
justice
potter
stewart
it
just
does,
i
mean
that
is
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
people
want
is
what
their
legislatures
enact,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
first,
one
justification
you
gave
was
that
you
want
to
prevent
spurious
claims,
but
does
that
apply
when
there
is
a
judicial
determination
that
there
is
a
relationship
here?
that
is
one.
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
child.
how
does
your
idea
about
making
a
will
have
any
merit?
justice
potter
stewart
the
common
laws,
i
remember
having
learned
it
many
years
ago,
was
that
an
illegitimate
child
was
nobody’s
child.
he
did
not
inherit
from
the
mother
or
father,
nullius
filius.
and
so
to
the
extent
that
illinois
does
allow
intestate
inheritance
from
the
mother
has
ameliorated
the
harshness
of
the
common
law
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
point
that
your
brother
made
was
that
in
louisiana,
the
father
was
not
free
to
make
a
will
to
designate
the
illegitimate
as
a
beneficiary
without
doing
something
further,
and
in
illinois
by
contrast,
the
father
was
solely
free
simply
by
naming
him
as
a
legatee
in
the
will
to
make
her
one?
justice
potter
stewart
they
had
to
acknowledge
and
then
make
a
will.
they
could
not
make
a
will
and
name
the
illegitimate
children
legatee
unless
they
acknowledged.
justice
potter
stewart
in
illinois,
by
contrast,
they
are
free
to
do
so
with
or
without
acknowledgement.
i
think
that
is
the
point
he
made
and
you
would
agree
with
that?
