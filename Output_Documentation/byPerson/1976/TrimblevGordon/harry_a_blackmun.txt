mr.
weill,
was
there
any
impediment
to
deta’s
parents’
marrying?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
was
a
paternity
suit
here,
wasn’t
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
prompted
that?
was
that
a
friendly
suit
or
an
unfriendly
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
this
law
suit
get
down
to
that
as
a
litigation
between
the
child
and
the
other
blood
relatives
of
the
decedent,
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
what
question
it;
this
is
what
it
amounts
to,
isn’t
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it,
mr.
weill,
from
your
comment
just
now
you
concede
that
the
rationality
standard
applies?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
that
you
said
that
under
any
standard
of
rationality?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
that
concept
need
the
blessing
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
or
does
it
flow
from
the
actions
of
the
legislature
as
justice
stewart
has
suggested?
