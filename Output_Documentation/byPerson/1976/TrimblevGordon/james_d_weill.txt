mr.
james
d.
weill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
concerns
the
question
that
whether
the
illinois
intestate
succession
statute,
which
excludes
illegitimate
children
from
inheritance
from
their
fathers
but
grants
such
inheritance
rights
to
all
legitimate
children,
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
deta
mona
trimble
was
born
in
1970.
her
parents
were
not
married.
deta
and
her
parents
lived
together
and
she
was
supported
by
her
father
pursuant
to
an
illinois
paternity
adjudication
and
support
order.
in
1974,
when
deta
trimble
was
three-and-a-half
years
old,
her
father,
sherman
gordon,
died
at
the
age
of
28,
the
victim
of
a
homicide.
he
left
no
will
and
no
surviving
spouse.
deta
is
his
only
child.
under
the
illinois
probate
act,
legitimate
children
inherit
from
either
parent
in
intestacy,
and
the
illegitimate
child,
on
the
other
hand,
will
inherit
from
his
or
her
mother
but
is
not
the
heir
of
an
intestate
father.
pursuant
to
this
statute,
the
probate
court
entered
an
order
declaring
sherman
gordon’s
heirs
to
be
his
parents’
siblings
and
a
half-brother.
the
court
rejected
the
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
illinois
supreme
court
granted
leave
to
appeal
directly
to
the
trimbles
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
then
affirmed
the
probate
court
decision.
there
was
no
written
opinion
since
the
court
held
that
its
decision
four
months
earlier
in
the
case
of
in
re
estate
of
karas
was
dispositive.
in
addition,
the
fully
brief
in
their
own
case
the
trimbles
had
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief
in
the
karas
case.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
there
was
none
that
we
know
of.
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes,
there
was
a
paternity
adjudication.
mr.
james
d.
weill
at
some
point,
ms.
trimble
may
have
been
on
public
aid
and
it
would
have
been
a
public
aid
suit.
the
public
aid
department
is
required
under
federal
law
wherever
anybody
is
on
afdc
to
establish
paternity
and
bring
a
suit
for
support.
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
a
question
of
whether
a
state
which
gives
inheritance
rights
to
children
generally
can
exclude
illegitimate
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes,
that
is
correct.
this
court
has
ruled
in
recent
years
in
several
cases
that
legitimate
children
and
illegitimate
children
whose
paternity
has
been
established
are
to
be
considered
to
be
identically
situated.
the
statute
at
issue
here
discriminates
because
it
denies
to
illegitimate
children
the
state-created
inheritance
right
which
is
accorded
to
children
generally.
this
discrimination
is
unconstitutional
under
any
standard
of
review
since
it
does
not
bear
the
remotest
rationale
relationship
to
any
legitimate
state
interest.
there
have
been
four
suggestions
made
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
or
by
appellees
here
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
we
do
not
concede
that,
we
still
believe
that
strict
scrutiny
or
some
form
of
heightened
scrutiny
is
potentially
applicable.
we
believe
that
because
illegitimate
children
bear
all
or
most
of
the
traditional
indicia
of
suspectness,
they
have
been
historically
discriminated
against
their
discrete
and
insular
minority
that
some
kind
of
heightened
scrutiny
is
applicable.
mr.
james
d.
weill
we
said
under
any
standard
of
equal
protection
review,
the
statute
must
fall.
the
statute,
because
there
is
no
rationale
basis
whatsoever,
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
of
a
higher
level
of
scrutiny.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
the
lucas
case
did
not
concern
a
total
exclusion
of
illegitimate
children.
the
lucas
case
found
the
statute
to
be
very
“carefully
tuned”
to
the
needs
and
considerations
of
including
illegitimate
children.
it
is
not
a
total
exclusion
like
this
is.
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes,
only
marginally
and
only
when
there
was
no
significant
evidence
of
pre-existing
support
or
paternity
adjudication.
where
however
the
statute
just
blanketly
excludes
illegitimate
children,
we
believe
that
some
form
of
heightened
scrutiny
is
appropriate
and
lucas
does
not
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes,
to
the
degree
that
illegitimate
children
cannot
inherit
from
their
fathers
in
intestacy,
the
state
has
created
a
total
exclusion
of
them.
mr.
james
d.
weill
if
the
parents
marry
and
the
father
acknowledges
the
child,
then
the
child
is
legitimate.
mr.
james
d.
weill
if
he
acknowledges
the
child,
or
if
the
child’s
paternity
is
adjudicated,
the
child
remains
illegitimate
and
is
not
eligible
to
inherit
under
the
illinois
intestacy
law.
mr.
james
d.
weill
these
intestacy
statutes
and
the
exclusion
of
illegitimate
children
come
out
of
medieval
england.
at
that
time
in
a
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
correct,
but
the
origin
of
them
relates
to
an
essentially
land
based
society.
the
illinois
supreme
court
suggested
that
its
main
concern
was
the
proof
problem
here,
and
that
was
the
main
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
correct,
but
it
is
our
contention
that
the
state
cannot
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
correct.
the
mother’s
maternity
is
relatively
easy
to
establish.
but
the
state
here
has
ignored
all
concerns
of
whether
or
not
paternity
has
been
established
of
the
father
for
the
child.
the
illinois
supreme
court
while
talks
about
the
proof
problem,
it
is
hypothesizing
various
abstract
situations.
it
is
not
dealing
with
the
reality
of
this
situation
or
analogous
situations
where
paternity
has
been
adjudicated
by
its
own
court
system.
in
that
case,
there
is
no
more
doubt
about
paternity
than
there
is
for
any
other
child.
they
are
not
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
also
ignored
situations
where
the
child’s
paternity
has
been
acknowledged.
there
is
no
proof
problem
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
paternity.
so
our
contention
to
this
is
supported
by
all
of
this
court’s
decisions
on
the
illegitimacy
area,
including
the
lucas
decision
that
the
state
cannot
exclude
all
illegitimate
children
based
on
proof
problems,
that
the
state
has
to
create
some
form
of
nexus
between
what
it
considers
to
be
the
proof
problem
and
the
scope
and
quality
of
the
exclusion,
and
this
blanket
exclusion
does
not
do
that.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
i
do
not
really
know,
the
record
does
not
show
that.
it
was,
i
believe,
brought
by
the
public
aid
department.
the
father,
sherman
gordon,
did
admit
during
the
course
of
that
trial;
he
did
admit
his
paternity.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
that
would
not
establish
the
eligibility.
the
eligibility
--
ms.
trimble
and
the
child
would
already
have
been
receiving
afdc.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
there
would
have
been
no
incentive
for
collusion
at
the
trial
of
any
kind
about
can
it
be
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
right,
but
there
were
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
a
pre-existing
recipient.
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
no,
because
they
were
not
married.
there
is
an
additional
obligation
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
right.
the
statute,
in
addition
to
seeking
to
acquire
support
from
fathers
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
marriage,
also
seeks
to
establish
the
paternity
of
illegitimate
children
under
this
federal
mechanism.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
only
in
the
last
resort
to
collect
the
support,
but
it
is
essentially
a
state
court
proceeding.
it
uses
the
normal
state
paternity
proceeding
but
now
that
portion
of
the
state
court
is
75%
federally
funded.
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes,
they
were.
the
second
rationale
offered
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
the
so-called
presumed
intent
argument
to
claim
that
the
statutory
disposition
is
in
the
court
with
the
presumed
intent
of
most
decedents.
this
argument
fails
in
the
first
instance
because
the
intestacy
statute
is
a
state
action,
and
the
state
cannot
base
its
statutory
scheme
on
a
presumption
of
invidious
private
intent
nor
can
the
state
itself
invidiously
discriminate.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
the
state
is
assuming
here
that
fathers
of
illegitimate
children
want
to
exclude
their
illegitimate
children,
they
have
no
intent
to
grant
inheritance
rights
or
otherwise
have
any
dealings
with
their
illegitimate
children.
whereas
they
do,
the
state
makes
the
exact
opposite
assumption
for
legitimate
children.
in
cases
like
stanley,
this
court
has
found
that,
that
assumption
is
inaccurate
that
the
state
is
building
its
view
of
child-father
relationships
on
totally
outdated
stereotypes.
mr.
james
d.
weill
if
the
statute
included
illegitimate
children
and
the
father
wanted
to,
by
will,
disinherit
his
legitimate
children
or
his
illegitimate
children,
he
can
do
that
by
will.
the
state
cannot
do
that
for
him
and
the
state
cannot
itself
assume,
across
the
board
of
its
population,
an
intent
to
discriminate
against
illegitimate
children,
which
this
court
has
said
in
eight
cases,
is
invidious,
that
it
is
basically
invidious
and
irrational
in
the
first
instance
to
discriminate
against
illegitimate
children.
mr.
james
d.
weill
i
believe
i
am
not
sure,
but
the
line
of
eight
cases
striking
down
such
discrimination
certainly
establishes
that
the
illegitimacy
discrimination
will
be
closely
looked
at,
and
that
it
is
to
a
degree
suspicious
to
exclude
all
illegitimate
children
from
any
statutory
scheme.
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
correct.
that
father’s
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
it
is
not
always
within
the
power
of
the
father
to
marry.
he
may
be
already
married
or
the
mother
may
be
already
married.
he
could
conceivably
write
a
will
but
as
we
point
out
in
the
briefs
very,
very
few
americans
write
wills,
and
particularly
those
of
the
class
and
not
only
of
the
decedent
father
here
but
of,
to
a
large
degree,
the
fathers
of
illegitimate
children.
their
illegitimacy
tends
to
occur
in
lower
and
moderate
income
units
where
there
is
not
a
lot
of
property;
there
is
not
a
great
incentive
to
write
a
will.
not
writing
a
will
may
be
because
there
is
no
access
to
lawyers
or
whatever.
so
the
argument
that
he
could
have
written
a
will
in
this
case,
a
28
year
old
man
who
died
from
homicide,
does
not
in
the
end
justify
the
state’s
own
invidious
action
here.
the
state
cannot
discriminate
just
because
it
allows
some
people
to
opt
out
of
that
discrimination.
in
addition,
returning
with
the
presumed
intent
for
a
second,
there
is
a
poll
in
illinois
that
is
just
reported
in
mr.
krauss’s
(ph)
book
which
shows
that
this
just
does
not
reflect,
the
statute
does
not
reflect
the
desires
of
illinois
people,
including
any
particular
sub-group,
sex
or
race.
the
poll
has
broken
that.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
but
in
this
case
it
helps
to
explain
why
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
rely
on
the
presumed
intent
argument
itself.
the
illinois
supreme
court
never
mentioned
that
it
thought
the
statute
was
in
accord
with
the
desires
of
these
fathers.
all
the
illinois
supreme
court
mentioned
essentially
was
the
proof
problem
and
the
last
point,
which
is,
illinois
said
they
had
an
interest
in
promoting
legitimate
family
relationships.
so
to
that
degree,
the
poll
explains
why
that
was
not
reached.
on
the
legitimate
family
relationship
point,
this
court
has
said
in
several
cases
that
penalizing
illegitimate
children
for
the
sins
of
their
parents
is
neither
a
just
nor
an
effectual
way
to
accomplish
the
state’s
goals
of
encouraging
legitimacy
and
encouraging
marriage.
mr.
james
d.
weill
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
that
it
reflects
the
policy
here
protecting
the
strengthening
of
family
relations?
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
generally
correct,
i
was
only
making
the
point
here
because
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
not
in
this
instance
said
that
this
law
reflects
the
general
intent
of
the
people
of
illinois.
but
that
was
not
a
basis.
now
that
presumption
certainly
can
be
made
even
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
make
it.
but
again,
that
does
not,
i
go
back,
that
does
not
justify
the
state’s
invidiously
discriminatory
action.
mr.
james
d.
weill
it
does
flow
from
--
there
is
a
presumption
that
the
legislation
represents
what
the
people
want,
but
i
am
suggesting
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
correct,
but
we
are
talking
about
it
in
a
different
context
here,
in
an
abnormal
context
where
the
presumed
intent
argument
does
not
relate
to
what
the
people
as
a
whole
want.
it
is
an
argument
about
what
decedents
and
particularly
want
decedents
in
a
particular
group,
and
the
illinois
court
refused
to
find
or
did
not
find
that
that
was
happening
here.
it
is
not
an
presumption
as
to
the
general
population.
i
would
like
to
turn
very
briefly
to
the
labine
case
which
this
court
decided
a
few
years
ago,
it
is
our
position
that
labine
is
substantially
distinguishable
on
several
grounds.
the
first
case,
labine
is
significantly
inclusive
of
illegitimate
children
in
a
way
that
the
illinois
statute
is
not.
labine
has
a
mechanism
for
support
of
minor
illegitimate
children.
labine
let
illegitimate
children
inherit
before
the
state
has
cheated
to
the
state.
labine
also
involved
a
right
to
inherit
where
there
would
be
unilateral
acknowledgement
by
the
father
and
a
unilateral
expression
of
an
intent
to
legitimate.
in
addition,
labine
involved
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
no.
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes,
the
second
to
the
last
paragraph
of
the
majority
opinion
in
labine
discusses
the
louisiana
supreme
court
decision
in
the
miller
case
in
which
the
unilateral
acknowledgement
and
statement
of
an
intent
to
legitimate
in
that
acknowledgement
by
the
father
entitled
the
child
to
intestate
succession
rights.
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
right,
but
louisiana
had
a
mechanism
for
that.
illinois
has
created
no
mechanism.
illinois’s
mechanism
is
a
paternity
adjudication,
but
then
illinois
has
turned
around
and
ignored
that
in
its
intestacy
scheme.
mr.
james
d.
weill
they
provided
for
the
support
for
the
minor
child
from
the
intestate
estate
of
the
fathers,
from
the
heirs
of
the
father.
the
child
had
a
right
to
so-called
alimony
or
support
from
the
estate,
not
support
while
the
father
was
still
alive.
since
the
gomez
decision,
that
has
been
true
in
all
states.
mr.
james
d.
weill
that
is
right.
louisiana
had
a
very
unusual
scheme
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
so
distinguishable
in
a
variety
of
ways,
others
of
which
are
mentioned
in
the
brief.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
d.
weill
just
one
point,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
standing
issues
are
fully
treated
in
the
briefs
and
i
just
would
like
to
point
out
that
most
of
the
arguments
that
opposing
counsel
has
made
have
been
implicitly
or
explicitly
rejected
by
this
court’s
unanimous
decision
in
reed
v.
reed.
in
reed,
a
case
involving
the
estate
of
less
than
$1000
by
the
way,
this
court,
where
there
was
sex
discrimination
in
the
appointment
of
administrators
in
intestate
estates,
this
court
rejected
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
even
though
it
recognized
that
it
eased
the
probate
court’s
administrative
burden
or
judicial
burden,
and
even
though
most
of
those
sexually
discriminatory
appointments
could
have
been
altered
by
a
will
of
the
decedent.
the
reed
case
is
structured
very
much
the
way
this
case
is,
and
this
court
unanimously
rejected
the
same
structure
in
a
similar
context.
sex,
like
illegitimacy,
has
not
been
treated
as
a
suspect
class
by
a
majority
of
the
court,
but
also
there
is
many
of
the
same
traditional
indicia
and
we
just
call
that
to
the
court’s
attention.
thank
you.
mr.
james
d.
weill
yes.
mr.
james
d.
weill
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
james
d.
weill
well,
i
believe
that
this
case
is
clearly
stronger
than
labine
on
the
facts.
first,
there
was
an
adjudication
here
of
the
father’s
paternity
for
all
purposes
and
illinois
has
said
that
this
is
this
father’s
child
or
was
this
father’s
child.
now
the
illinois
supreme
court
turns
around
and
says,
but
there
are
proof
problems.
there
just
are
no
proof
problems
in
this
case
at
all.
it
is
stronger
than
labine
in
that
sense.
secondly,
the
labine
scheme,
as
i
mentioned,
was
inclusive
of
illegitimate
children.
this
court
has
consistently
struck
down
total
exclusions
of
illegitimate
children
from
any
statutory
scheme
in
the
last
eight
years.
the
two
partial
exceptions
have
been
labine
and
lucas.
in
both
of
those
cases,
there
were
substantial
benefits
to
the
class
of
illegitimate
children.
labine
may
not
have
been
as
carefully
tuned
as
lucas
was,
but
it
was
significantly
inclusive.
those
are
just
the
two
major
points
i
make.
mr.
james
d.
weill
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
father
in
labine
and
the
sub-class
of
fathers
in
labine
were
free
to
make
wills
because
there
were
acknowledgements
there.
mr.
james
d.
weill
right,
but
then
--
mr.
james
d.
weill
they
are
free
to
do
in
illinois
as
a
matter
of
fact,
yes.
thank
you.
