mr.
miles
n.
beermann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
has
held
that
illegitimates
are
a
suspect
class.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
proper
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
particular
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
is
not
the
scrutiny
test
that
counsel
would
ask
us
to
adhere
to,
or
even
a
higher
scrutiny,
but
the
reasonable
basis
test
and
whether
or
not
this
statute
bears
some
rational
relationship
to
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
i
think
in
one
of
the
questions,
counsel
was
asked
about
that
and
if
i
may,
i
think
that
the
state
purposes
that
this
statute
serves
are:
(1)
to
encourage
family
relationships;
(2)
to
regulate
property
of
decedents
who
die
intestate
--
property
that
is
located
within
the
borders
of
the
state;
(3)
the
stability
of
land
titles;
and
(4)
the
prompt
and
definitive
determination
of
the
valid
ownership
of
property
left
by
decedents.
also,
i
would
say
along
with
that
is
the
prompt
adjudication
of
probate
estates.
another
one
of
the
purposes
would
be
to
deter
spurious
claims,
which
i
will
get
into.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
no,
your
honors,
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
are
talking
about
$1500.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
my
client
--
i
only
get
one
client,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
mother
of
the
decedent,
so
that
she
would
be
the
blood
paternal
grandmother
of
the
little
girl.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
it
stills
set
up
a
mechanism
whereby
the
child
can
be
recognized.
insofar
as
labine,
as
counsel
alluded
to,
said
that
when
the
father
in
labine
acknowledged
the
child,
he
could
have
also
made
another
statement
along
with
that
acknowledgement,
allowing
the
child
to
inherit,
but
he
did
not
do
that.
in
this
case,
the
decedent
did
not
marry
the
mother
of
the
child
and
did
not
acknowledge
the
child.
now
technically,
the
child
was
acknowledged
for
him
in
the
paternity
proceedings
and
it
was
an
order
that
issued
from
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
deciding
that
he
was
the
father
and
ordering
him
to
pay
support
for
the
child.
getting
back
to
the
state
purposes,
they
were
recognized
as
being
valid
not
only
in
labine
but
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
weber
v.
aetna.
even
though
the
weber
decision
went
the
other
way
because
it
was
discrimination,
as
i
recall
it,
among
illegitimates.
it
is
clear
that
the
power
to
make
such
rules,
to
bear
that
relationship
to
the
state
purposes
should
be
left
to
the
state.
getting
to
the
statutory
will
theory,
i
believe
that
the
statutory
will
theory
is
a
viable
and
valid
theory.
i
think
that
the
laws
on
intestacy
are
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
determine
to
whom
the
decedent
would
want
his
property
distributed
if
he
were
to
die
unexpectedly
or
without
making
a
will.
now,
the
fact,
as
counsel
alludes
to
that
most
people
do
not
make
wills,
i
think
proves
that
people
are
satisfied
with
the
legislative
action
in
this
area.
for
example,
in
illinois,
if
there
is
no
will
and
there
is
a
surviving
spouse
and
no
children,
the
surviving
souse
i
believe
receives
everything.
if
there
are
children,
the
surviving
spouse
receives
one
third
and
the
children
receive
two
thirds.
in
this
particular
case,
the
decedent
by
making
a
will
could
have
left
everything
to
his
child.
now
in
illinois,
a
surviving
spouse
if
she
is
left
out
of
the
will
can
renounce
the
will.
the
children
have
no
right
to
renounce
the
will
and
there
is
no
right
in
a
child
in
illinois
to
inherit
from
its
father.
that
does
not
mean
whether
you
are
legitimate
or
illegitimate.
you
would
give
away
to
your
mother,
so
to
speak.
she
has
the
right
to
renounce
the
will
and
children
do
not
have
a
right
to
renounce
the
will.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
an
after-born
child
i
think,
if
i
recall
the
statute
correctly,
is
an
automatic
revocation
of
the
will,
your
honor,
and
the
after-born
child
takes
as
if
the
decedents
died
intestate.
so
if
the
decedent
had
cut
out
of
his
children
that
were
born
before
the
after-born
child,
the
after-born
could
take
as
if
there
was
no
will,
even
if
the
other
children
were
cut
out.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that,
justice
stevens.
you
are
100%
correct.
what
i
am
stating
is
that
the
children
in
illinois
have
no
inherent
right
to
inherit
from
their
father,
and
yes,
if
the
father
dies
intestate,
legitimate
children
would
inherit
two-thirds
or
all
of
his
estate
as
the
case
may
be.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
not
except
that
you
may
--
i
suppose
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind
when
they
added
the
added
criteria
or
the
added
condition
of
having
the
parents
to
marry
would
be
so
that
the
illegitimate
children
would
not
take
to
the
exclusion
of
legitimate
children.
i
think
one
of
the
main
problems
here
is
the
philosophical
problem
of
whether
or
not,
the
fact
that
a
child
has
been
decreed
to
be
the
child
of
the
decedent,
if
you
will,
means
that,
that
child
is
the
natural
object
of
the
decedent’s
bounty.
the
child
is
the
victim
of
an
illicit
relationship
and
i
think
that
overwriting
all
of
these
concerns
is
the
family
relationship.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
do
not
think
it
is
--
i
look
at
it
from
the
opposite
way.
i
think
that
by
stating
that
--
what
the
legislature
is
trying
to
do,
i
think,
and
what
the
public
policy
of
the
state
is,
is
to
foster
legitimate
family
relationships
and
not
to
foster
illicit
relationships
by
stating
that
if
you
die
intestate,
your
illegitimate
children
will
share
in
your
estate.
i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
answering
your
question,
but
the
--
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
any
answer.
the
point
is
that
the
father,
if
he
wanted
to,
could
make
a
will
and
leave
all
of
his
estate
to
any
of
his
children,
or
to
none
of
his
children,
as
the
case
may
be.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
really
think
it
does.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
mysterious
about
making
a
will.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
relationship
to
a
legitimate
state
purpose.
i
cannot
conceive
of
one.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
could
imagine
under
certain
circumstances
it
could
be
realistic.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
because
i
do
not
think
that
this
kind
of
a
statute
is
something
that
the
legislature
--
i
do
not
think
they
have
the
right
to
pass
the
statute.
i
think
that
statute
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional,
denial
of
equal
protection.
let
us
take
--
we
can
carry
the
hypothesis
a
little
further.
if
you
have
a
white
man
married
to
a
black
woman
then
if
he
one
that
die,
and
he
could
not
die
intestate
then
because
under
your
hypothetical
situation,
his
money
would
not
go
to
his
children
assuming
that
they
would
be
deemed
black.
so
that
he
would
ask
to
make
a
will
in
order
to
leave
the
money
to
his
children.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
do
not
think
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
think
that
is
the
answer
to
it.
i
think
that
there
has
been
no
decision
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
sorry,
your
honor,
i
won’t.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
what
would
make
the
statute
and
justice
stevens’
hypothetical
clearly
unconstitutional.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
at
the
least,
at
the
least,
and
then
i
do
not
think
that
there
could
be
any
rational
or
reasonable
purpose
of
the
state
in
passing
such
a
statute.
the
other
things
that
i
wanted
to
point
out,
and
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
have
alluded
to
some
of
them,
is
that
the
decedent
could
change
the
so-called
statutory
will
by
a
number
of
methods.
he
could
execute
a
written
will,
he
could
create
a
joint
tenancy,
he
could
designate
the
beneficiary
of
a
life
insurance
policy,
he
could
create
a
trust,
he
could
make
a
gift.
there
is
a
number
of
things
he
could
do
either
under
illinois
statute
or
by
law,
by
federal
law.
he
could
have
--
and
as
i
have
already
stated,
he
could
have
left
the
entire
estate
to
this
child
with
exclusion
of
everyone.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
theoretically,
he
had
all
those
options.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
it.
i
do
not
know
that
we
are
talking
in
a
limited
fashion
about
sherman
gordon,
the
decedent
in
this
case.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
in
reality,
your
honor,
i
would
say
you
are
probably
correct
that
sherman
gordon,
although
he
might
have
some
life
insurance.
he
might
have
had
a
life
insurance
policy
from
his
job,
and
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
he
might
have
had.
in
today’s
society
most
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well
i
think
he
could
have
gotten
it
at
a
number
of
places.
in
chicago
there
are
all
types
of
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well…
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
a
will
of
this
type
would
probably
cost
about
$25
to
$50.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor
though
that
we
can
set
up
a
standard
based
on
this
one
particular
man.
knowing
we
are
talking
about
this
one
particular
man,
i
know
that
your
question
alludes
to
him,
and
you
have
stated
quite
succinctly
to
me
that
you
are
talking
about
him.
but
if
we
start
going
on
a
case-to-case
method
of
who
is
the
man
in
this
case,
could
he
have
made
a
will,
and
if
counsel
was
right
and
all
of
those
people
were
in
that
position,
i
just
do
not
agree
with
that.
there
are
legal
poverty
offices
all
over
the
city
of
chicago.
counsel
is
a
member
of
one
of
them.
probably,
sherman
gordon
could
have
made
a
will
and
not
been
charged
any
fee
at
all
by
going
into
counsel’s
office.
so
that
i
think
that,
that
theory
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
1974,
i
believe.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
oh,
yes.
i
think
we
had
even
more
of
them
than
we
do
now,
your
honor.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
it
is
like
about
a
half
a
paragraph
of
a
will.
all
he
had
to
do
was
start
out
with
a
normal
opening
paragraph
and
state
that
he
leaves
everything
that
he
owns
to
his
daughter,
and
name
her,
and
have
three
witnesses
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it.
he
could
have
probably
gotten
that
on
half
a
page.
so,
maybe
$25
is
too
much.
one
of
the
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
am
perfect
agreeing
with
that.
that
is
the
whole
point,
i
am
sure
that
if
the
court
was
convinced
that
we
were
just
talking
about
this
one
case,
and
it
was
only
$1,500
involved,
and
that
whatever
the
court
did
in
this
case
did
not
transcend
these
particular
facts,
that
we
would
not
be
here
arguing
the
case.
another
recognized
purpose
of
the
statute
is
the
prevention
of
spurious
claims.
the
court
has
recognized
that
purpose
in
many
of
its
decisions,
most
notably
in
the
jimenez
case
decided
in
1974.
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
karas
case
alluded
to
the
grandfather
type
example
where
a
grandfather
dies
and
he
had
one
child,
a
son,
who
pre-deceased
him
by
let
us
say
15
or
20
years.
the
grandmother,
the
wife
of
the
present
decedent,
is
left
surviving
and
she
would
be
entitled
to
his
entire
estate
by
the
laws
of
intestacy.
now,
some
person
comes
along
claiming
to
be
the
illegitimate
child
of
the
son
who
has
been
dead
for
20
years
and
there
is
really
no
way
to
disprove
the
paternity.
on
the
other
hand,
the
child
of
course
has
a
tough
time
proving
it
but
it
puts
this
widow
of
the
grandfather
in
an
awfully
tough
position.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
it’s
not
only
that,
there
were
two
cases
there
your
honor,
and
they
both
stopped
there
at
the
illinois
supreme
court.
i
am
sorry
but
i
do
not
know
why
they
did
not
come
here.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
yes
your
honor.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
because
we
are
talking
about
the
narrow
issue
your
honor.
the
laws
of
intestacy
take
up
two
or
three
pages
in
the
illinois
statutes.
the
thing
that
we
are
talking
about
takes
up
about
two
sentences,
and
the
theory
being
that
if
you
accept
the
theory
of
a
statutory
will,
that
the
man
who
dies
intestate
is
presumed
to
know
the
law,
and
is
presumed
to
adopt
the
laws
of
intestacy
as
his
so-called
statutory
will,
then
he
knows
he
has
got
an
illegitimate
child
and
the
illegitimate
child
cannot
recover.
he
knows,
for
example,
as
sherman
gordon
can
be
presumed
to
know
in
this
case
that
if
he
had
a
mother
and
some
brothers
--
he
had
a
mother
and
father
and
some
brothers
and
sisters
as
i
recall
--
the
mother
and
father
and
brothers
and
sisters
would
share
equally.
now
he
further
knows
that
by
writing
a
will,
he
could
have
disinherited
all
of
those
people
and
left
his
entire
estate
to
the
little
girl.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
am
not
accepting
the
theory
that
the
state
law
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
yes,
sir.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
no,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
yes,
i
believe
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
the
situation
can
be
changed
by
a
will.
i
do
not
accept
the
fact
that
there
is
anything
to
correct.
that
is
my
point.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
for
one
thing,
the
fact
that
the
child
might
be
left
something,
from
the
child’s
standpoint
it
certainly
will
not
legitimate
the
child.
i
think
that
from
the
child’s
standpoint,
it
probably
does
not
help,
except
it
does
not
legitimate
him
by
becoming
an
heir
of
his
father,
and
by
the
same
token,
i
think
that
you
were
then
getting
into
the
realm
of
where
do
you
stop.
i
mean
do
you
then
pass
a
law
that
says
that
the
illegitimate
child
has
to
recover
because
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
society
does
not
treat
them
that
way
in
almost
every
respect.
unfortunately
that
is
the
case
and
i
think
that
the
illinois
legislature
has
recognized
that
and
i
think
that
the
illinois
legislature
has
announced
the
public
policy
of
the
state,
that
they
will
not
be
treated
the
same
because
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
do
not
think
it
is
exactly
that,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
is
because
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
no,
i
do
not
think
they
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
illegitimates.
i
think
they
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
parents,
and
that
the
parents
--
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
illinois,
acting
through
its
general
assembly,
wants
the
parents
to
not
be
involved
in
illicit
relationships,
and
so
that
they
do
everything
that
they
can.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
because
that
child
might
not
be,
or
the
legislature
presumes
that
the
people
of
the
state
do
not
intend
that
their
child
is
the
natural
object
of
the
intestate
or
the
intestate
man’s
bounty.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
i
do
not
think
that
is
exactly
right
because
there
are
(voice
overlap).
exactly,
and
which
he
was
in
this
case,
and
he
was
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
this
particular
consequence,
correct.
it
is
our
contention
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
that
has
been
on
the
books
for
many
years
in
illinois,
this
particular
rule.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
other
point
we
want
to
make
on
this
issue
is
that
it
is
our
contention
that
this
court’s
decision
in
labine
v.
vincent
controls,
and
it
especially
controls
because
in
this
case
and
under
the
facts
of
this
situation,
the
father
here
could
have
done
more
for
this
child
than
could
the
father
in
labine.
for
example
in
labine,
the
child
must
be
acknowledged
in
order
to
take
under
the
father’s
will.
that
is
one
thing
that
we
have
not
heard
yet.
you
just
could
not
make
a
will
in
labine
and
leave
your
estate
to
the
child
under
louisiana
law,
which
is
just
as
justice
marshall
points
out
is
entirely
different
from
the
other
49
states.
then
even
if
the
child
is
acknowledged
and
you
make
a
will
leaving
him
part
of
your
estate,
you
can
only
leave
him
either
one-fourth
or
one-third
of
the
estate,
and
that
is
if
there
are
no
surviving
legitimate
children
or
their
heirs.
while
in
illinois,
illinois
has
ameliorated
the
rule
as
you
point
out,
justice
stewart,
a
filius
nullius,
because
if
we
made
the
rule
he
could
leave
the
child
everything.
also,
apparently
in
louisiana,
acknowledgement
is
a
condition
precedent
to
the
child’s
right
to
claim
support
from
the
father.
that
is
not
true
on
illinois,
as
is
evident
in
this
case
because
when
a
paternity
suit
is
brought,
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
plead
guilty.
he
can
put
up
a
defense
and
if
the
court
finds
that
he
is
guilty,
then
he
never
has
to
acknowledge
the
fact
that
he
is
the
father.
he
is
adjudicated
the
father
and
he
is
made
to
support
the
child.
also
in
louisiana,
an
acknowledged
child
can
inherit
from
the
father
intestate
if
the
father
has
no
heirs
or
collateral
or
linear,
to
the
exclusion
only
of
the
state.
of
course
in
illinois,
an
illegitimate
can
never
inherit
intestate
from
the
father.
that
is
the
main
difference.
the
other
striking
point
is
that
in
louisiana,
legitimate
children
have
a
right
of
forced
heirship
in
their
father’s
estate,
whereas
in
illinois,
as
i
pointed
out,
legitimate
children
do
not
have
that
right.
so
that
it
is
our
contention
that
labine
would
control
even
more
in
this
case
than
it
did
on
the
facts
of
its
own
case.
i
would
like
to
allude
to
the
sex
discrimination
issue
although
counsel
has
not
talked
about
it.
we
have
serious
doubt
that
it
is
even
properly
before
the
court.
i
think
we
briefed
all
that.
i
just
would
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing
that
when
the
notice
of
appeal
was
originally
filed
in
this
case
--
and
i
am
sorry
that
this
is
not
in
my
brief,
but
i
hope
that
your
honors
will
indulge
me.
when
the
notice
of
appeal
was
originally
filed
in
this
case,
from
the
order
of
the
probate
court
of
county
declaring
the
heirship,
only
the
mother
was
named
as
an
appellant
in
only
a
representative
capacity.
she
was
named
as
jessie
trimble
as
the
mother
and
next
friend
of
the
child,
deta
mona
trimble.
so
that
we
do
not
believe
she
is
a
proper
appellant.
now
the
record
got
pretty
muddied
up
because
what
happened
after
that
was,
when
they
made
their
motion
under
illinois
supreme
court
rule
302(b)
for
a
direct
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court,
thus
bypassing
the
appellate
court,
you
do
that
in
matters
of
importance
that
require
proper
termination.
all
of
a
sudden,
she
became
an
appellant
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
nobody
objected
to
it
i
have
to
admit
that,
but
she
suddenly
became
an
appellant.
then
she
also
became
an
appellant
in
a
notice
of
appeal
to
this
court
and
in
her
brief
amicus
curiae
in
the
karas
case,
she
as
named
as
a
party.
but
the
fact
is
that
under
illinois
supreme
court
rule
301,
the
notice
of
appeal
is
a
jurisdictional
stock
and
i
do
not
think
that
anybody
can
waive
it
by
not
arguing
it
and
i
do
not
think
anybody
can
cure
it.
so
i
do
not
really
believe
that
she
is
a
proper
party
in
this
court.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
oh
no,
it
is
of
this
issue,
your
honor.
the
sex
discrimination
issue,
because
our
argument
is
that
in
the
sex
discrimination
issue,
it
cannot
really
apply,
not
into
the
merits
of
it,
it
cannot
really
apply
to
the
illegitimate
because
there
is
no
discrimination
based
on
the
sex
of
the
illegitimate.
male
illegitimates
and
female
illegitimates
are
treated
the
same
way.
but
their
argument
is
that
the
mother,
a
female
person,
is
being
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
her
sex
and
treated
differently
than
a
male
person,
because
the
female
person
have
to
--
she
does
have
the
--
their
theory
is
this:
that
she
does
not
have
the
assistance
of
the
fact
that
the
illegitimate
could
inherit
from
the
father
and
easing
her
burden
of
supporting
the
illegitimate.
we
do
not
agree
with
this
contention.
i
think
it
is
really
getting
far-fetched.
but
our
point
is
we
are
not
quite
sure
based
on
this
record,
although
we
did
brief
it
on
the
merits
that,
that
issue
really
is
before
the
court
because
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
would
say
you
are
correct
your
honor.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
no,
i
did
not
bypass,
they
bypassed.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
i
was
not
in
the
case
then
your
honor.
i
hate
to
give
you
that
answer
but
let
me
tell
you
what
happened.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
well,
that
is
my
point.
i
want
you
to
understand
something
because
you
just
talked
about
it
earlier.
because
of
the
size
of
the
estate,
nobody
was
defending
this
case
in
the
illinois
courts.
it
never
was
defended
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
there
was
oral
argument
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
it
was
a
unilateral
argument.
only
the
appellants
in
this
case
argued
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
they
had
a
very
short
argument
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
chief
justice
cut
short
their
argument
on
the
basis
that
the
case
was
controlled
by
the
karas
opinion.
i
did
not
get
into
the
case
until
it
came
to
this
court.
it
is
easy
for
me
to
say
now,
if
i
was
in
the
case,
i
would
have
raised
these
points.
the
point
is
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
that
is
correct.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
the
way
they
are
making
the
argument
--
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
they
are
making
the
argument
through
the
mouth
of
the
mother
and
not
her
father.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
that
is
right.
well,
if
the
child
has
the
standing
to
assert
the
claim,
then
of
course
it
could
be
asserted
because
i
make
no
claim
that
the
child
is
an
improper
party.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
no,
he
is
the
father
of
the
decedent.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
the
natural
father
of
the
decedent.
i
represent
that
the
decedent’s
mother,
ethel
may
king,
the
other
people,
the
father
and
the
brothers
and
sisters,
have
seen
fit
not
to
take
part
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
miles
n.
beermann
right,
that
is
correct.
so
that
without
belaboring
the
point,
we
still
do
not
believe
that
the
sex
discrimination
is
properly
before
the
court
and
we
also
state
that
there
is
a
necessary
distinction
here
that
was
alluded
to
before
in
the
other
argument
that
there
is
a
biological
difference
between
the
mothers
and
the
fathers.
and
as
counsel
stated,
maternity
is
almost
never
an
issue,
i
cannot
conceive
of
when
it
would
ever
be
an
issue
unless
you
had
a
kidnapping
of
a
child
out
of
the
hospital
nursery.
the
mother
is
always
present
when
the
child
is
born.
so
our
contention
is
that
the
mother
is
not
being
discriminated
against
and
the
child,
of
course,
is
not
being
discriminated
against
because
of
her
sex,
because
male
and
female
legitimates
are
treated
the
same.
thank
you
very
much.
