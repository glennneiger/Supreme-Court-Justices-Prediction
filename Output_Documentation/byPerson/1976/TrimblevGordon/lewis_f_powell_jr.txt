f.
powell,
jr.
the
next
case,
trimble
against
gordon,
75-5952,
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
validity
of
a
provision
of
the
illinois
probate
act,
which
allows
illegitimate
children
to
inherit
by
intestate
succession
from
their
mothers
but
not
from
their
fathers.
legitimate
children,
however,
may
inherit
from
both
their
mothers
and
fathers.
this
suite
was
instituted
by
a
mother
on
behalf
of
her
illegitimate
child.
the
father
had
supported
the
child,
openly
acknowledged
her
and
also,
have
been
found
to
her
father
in
a
paternity
order
issued
by
an
illinois
court.
he
had
not
had
a
marital
mother
or
legally
adapted
a
child.
he
died
without
a
will
and
this
suite
challenged
the
validity
on
equal
protection
grounds
of
the
statute
that
prevented
the
child
from
inheriting.
the
illinois
supreme
court
sustained
the
validity
of
the
statute,
relying
primarily
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
labine
against
vincent.
a
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
although,
we
recognize
the
relevance
of
labine,
we
think
its
rationale
has
been
substantially
undercut
by
more
recent
cases.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
have
filed
dissenting
statements.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
