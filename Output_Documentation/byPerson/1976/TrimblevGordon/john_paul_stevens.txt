just
doing
a
little
faster
mr.
weill.
the
third,
it
was
that
in
labine
they
allowed
inheritance
when
there
was
a
unilateral
expression
by
the
father.
that
was
inherited
if
there
was
a
will,
wasn’t
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
intestate
succession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
statement
of
intent
to
legitimate,
which
we
do
not
have
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see
--
and
the
first
distinction
you
gave
was
that
there
they
provided
for
support,
but
here
this
support
--
i
do
not
think
that
distinction
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
beermann,
we
are
not
really
talking
about
very
much
of
the
estate,
are
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
clients
concede
there
--
or
maybe
it
does
not
make
any
difference
anyway.
do
they
have
a
blood
relationship
to
this
little
girl?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
you
are
not
defending
the
illinois
statute
as
a
matter
of
policy
if
you
were
a
legislator,
when
it
says
that
the
paternity
suit
or
an
acknowledgement
is
not
enough,
there
has
to
be
marriage
in
addition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
quite
right
to
say
that
the
children
have
no
rights
because
if
there
is
no
will
at
all
and
the
parent
dies
intestate,
there
are
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
your
argument
about
the
problem
of
probate,
certainty
of
title
in
property,
ownership
and
all
the
rest,
how
does
that
apply
when
you
have
got
an
adjudication,
as
you
do
in
this
case,
of
paternity?
why
is
that
any
harder
to
establish
than
the
normal
legitimate
father?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
family
argument
has
always
puzzled
me
somewhat
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
by
saying
to
the
father,
if
you
have
illegitimate
children
they
cannot
share
in
your
estate.
that
is
less
of
a
deterrent
than
if
you
said
to
the
father,
if
you
have
an
illegitimate
child,
that
child
will
share
with
your
children.
why
does
one
deter
the
misconduct
more
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
rely
on
the
ability
to
make
the
will,
of
course
that
answers
everything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
guys
suppose
you
can
have
a
statute
that
said,
blacks
shall
not
inherit
from
whites
because
you
presume
whites
would
not
want
blacks
to
inherit
their
property,
and
always
make
a
will
to
leave
the
property
to
whomever
they
want
to.
i
mean
what
would
be
wrong
with
such
a
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
a
legitimate
purpose
would
be
that,
presumably,
if
people
had
to
take
a
poll,
most
people
would
assume
that
more
whites
would
want
their
property
to
go
to
people
of
the
same
race
than
the
people
of
another
race.
but
isn’t
that
a
realistic
assumption,
even
if
it
might
not
be
a
very
attractive
one?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
wouldn’t
be
--
what
would
be
wrong
with
that?
people
could
avoid
that
consequence
by
making
a
will
too.
how
is
that
different
from
saying
you
cut
out
the
illegitimate?
why
could
not
you
have
this
same
kind
of
statute
on
racial
grounds,
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
beermann,
the
claim,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
you
have
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
who
die
intestate.
all
of
them
could
have
made
a
will
but
you
have
a
large
portion
of
the
population
that
die
intestate.
and
that
the
children
of
those
intestate
decedents
are
of
two
kinds:
some
are
legitimate
and
some
are
illegitimate.
of
course
all
men
could
have
made
a
will
and
left
his
property
as
he
wanted
to.
but
looking
at
it
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
surviving
child,
what
is
the
justification
in
terms
of
the
child
for
treating
the
illegitimate
differently
from
the
illegitimate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
claim
is
that
they
should
be
treated
the
same
as
a
legitimate
child
is
treated.
there
is
no
claim
here
that
they
would
take
a
preference
to
a
widow
or
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
over
the
years
society
has
treated
illegitimates
as
a
less
desirable
class
of
people,
the
legislature
can
continue
to
do
so.
that
is
your
argument
as
i
see
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
less
worthy
group
of
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
they
say
to
the
father
is
that
if
you
are
involved
in
an
illicit
relationship,
you
do
not
have
to
worry
about
your
property
going
to
the
child
of
that
illicit
relationship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
you
say
to
the
father
you
can
do
this
and
you
do
not
have
to
worry
about
the
consequences.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
not
have
to
worry
about
this
particular
consequence
at
least.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
beermann
isn’t
your
point
--
let
me
see
if
i
state
it,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
to
the
extent
that
you
opponent
claims
a
gender-based
discrimination,
the
fact
that
she
cannot
inherit
from
her
father
but
she
might
have
been
able
to
inherit
from
her
mother.
she
may
not
make
the
argument
that
her
mother
could
make.
that
is
what
you
are
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
may
be
that
she
has
standing
to
make
the
argument
anyway,
but
you
are
just
saying
she
cannot
make
what
ever
argument
her
mother
could
make.
so
she
had
a
standing
question,
really.
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
cannot
argue
the
impact
of
the
statute
on
her
mother.
that
is
what
you
are
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
i
see.
you
are
saying
the
mother
is
not
a
party
in
her
own
right,
but
it
would
not
make
any
difference
if
we
thought
the
child
had
a
standing
to
assert
this
claim
anyway.
