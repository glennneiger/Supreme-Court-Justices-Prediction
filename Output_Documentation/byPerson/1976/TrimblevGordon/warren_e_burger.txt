we
will
hear
arguments
now
in
75-5952,
trimble
v.
gordon.
mr.
weill,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
there
is
no
rational
basis
whatever
for
this.
what
was
the
historical
basis
long
thought
to
be
the
justification?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
they
have
regarded
as
valid
somewhat
later
than
medieval
england,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
there
is
no
problem
with
proving
mother.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
does
not
open
itself
to
a
fraud,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
your
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
to
at
least
intimate
that
this
was
not
an
unfriendly
adversary
paternity
suit.
did
i
get
that
correctly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
was,
you
said,
to
establish
eligibility
for
a
particular
welfare?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
without
it,
was
there
a
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
i
did
misunderstand
you.
i
had
the
impression
from
your
response
that
it
was
related
to
some
degree
of
eligibility
for
benefits.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
always
within
the
power
of
the
father
to
remedy
that,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
accorded
by
marriage
or
by
a
will
or
by
a
gift?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
separate
basis
for
attack
on
the
statute
that
you
take
a
poll
and
what
the
legislature
has
enacted
does
not
reflect
the
will
of
the
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
beermann?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
another
element
was
introduced
in
the
hypothetical
question
as
i
understood
it,
the
legitimacy
is
not
suspect
but
a
racial
discriminatory
statute
would
be
quite
suspect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
clearly
suspect
at
this
contextual
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
a
$25
or
$50
will
would
not
be
a
burden
on
the
legal
aid,
if
they
are
willing
to
come
all
the
way
to
washington.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
this
case
should
be
resolved
whether
it
was
$1,500,
$15,000
or
a-million-and-a-half.
the
principles
are
the
same,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
is
jurisdictional,
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
you
were
in
the
case
or
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
weill?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
