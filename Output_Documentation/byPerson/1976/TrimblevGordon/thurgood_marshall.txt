justice

marshall
of
course,
basic
to
all
of
that
is
louisiana
is
based
on
the
pollyanna
code
and
the
rest
of
the
states
are
based
on
time
alone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
started
out
saying
that
illegitimate
children
were
not
a
suspect
class.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
the
answer
to
it
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
please
do
not
forget
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
talking
about
a
man
whose
net
worth
is
less
than
$1500
had
all
those
options?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
theoretically.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am.
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
are
talking
about
all
this
great
legal
advice
he
had
that
he
could
get.
i
wonder
where
could
he
get
it
from.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
reason
that
he
ever
thought
of
a
will?
a
man
with
$1500?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
do
you
charge
for
drawing
the
will
of
a
driver,
about
$1500?
justice
thurgood
marshall
really!
well,
how
many
do
you
get
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
why
not
be
realistic.
a
man
with
that
much
income,
about
to
get
his
head
blown
off.
i
mean
he
is
not
the
type
of
person
who
gets
in
all
these
legal
niceties.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
not
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
all
the
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
our
understanding
you
are
talking
about
the
intestate
law
of
illinois.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
purpose
is,
as
i
understand,
to
take
care
of
estates
where
there
is
no
will.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
is
it
that
defense
do
it
that
you
can
make
a
will
to
get
around
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
it
is
an
adequate
defense
to
any
unconstitutionality
of
the
state
law
the
fact
that
a
will
could
have
corrected
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
--
this
provision
can
be
corrected
by
a
will.
that
is
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
the
reason
that
it
is
constitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
it
constitutional
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
can
be
corrected
by
a
will.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
we
pass
on
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois?
is
that
not
the
best
court
to
pass
on
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
deliberately
bypassed
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
did
not
raise
it.
