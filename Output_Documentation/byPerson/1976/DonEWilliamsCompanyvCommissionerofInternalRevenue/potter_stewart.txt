justice
potter
stewart
was
this
an
interest-bearing
note
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
rate?
justice
potter
stewart
the
profit-sharing
plan
is
not
a
taxpayer
though,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there's
--
the
reason
that
you
explained
was
behind
the
enactment
of
267
is
was
--
it
does
not
exist
here.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
some
dispute
in
the
briefs,
i
gather,
as
to
what
the
uniform
commercial
code
provides
in
this
area.
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
the
illinois
version
of
the
code
provides
that
a
note
is
equivalent
to
a
check.
that's
your
submission,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
other
states
and
in
the
proposed
uniform
commercial
code,
it
is
not,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
wondered
if
you
agreed
as
to
what
the
state
of
the
law
was.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
that's
the
case,
what
differences
are
made
whether
or
not
you're
accrual
or
cash
basis
taxpayer?
justice
potter
stewart
the
check,
a
check
is
the
same
and
--
and
you
told
us
that
a
--
a
check
and
a
note
are
the
same.
justice
potter
stewart
has
delivered
the
note
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
i
understand
your
argument,
the
same
argument
--
basic
same
argument
could
be
made
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
a
cash
basis
taxpayer.
justice
potter
stewart
because
on
the
other
hand
you
--
you
do
not
claim
that
a
mere
accrual
is
sufficient,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
books
of
--
of
your
client.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
claim
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
normally,
that
would
be
sufficient
for
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer.
justice
potter
stewart
the
normal
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
you
concede
that
you
must
at
least
have
transferred
a
note.
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
should
that
be
if
you
are
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
let's
go
back
to
my
original
question.
couldn't
be
--
is
the
same
argument
applicable
in
full
force
to
a
cash
basis
taxpayer?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
did
not
say
the
argument
would
prevail
but
--
but
your
argument
didn't
prevail
in
the
court
of
appeals
either
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
accrual
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
certainly,
there
is
a
difference,
but
the
basic
difference
has
always
been
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
can
accrue
a
liability
or
accrue
--
or
on
the
other
side
of
ledger
income
on
his
books
and
that's
sufficient
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
or
without
payment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
here,
you
can
see
that
an
accrual
of
the
liability
to
the
fund
would
not
be
sufficient
to
give
you
a
deduction
as
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
i
understand
your
argument
that
there
must
be
a
note.
and
the
reason
there
must
be
a
note
as
you
can
see
there
must
be
payment.
you
said
a
note
is
equivalent
to
payment
and
that
would
be
equally
true
with
tax
basis
taxpayer
or
cash
basis
taxpayer,
i
should
think.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
basic
argument
is
that
actually
paid
as
i
understand
it,
anything
to
the
word
“paid”.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
like
a
sign
where
it
says
no
smoking
or
positively
no
smoking,
it
means
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
the
demand
interest-bearing
note
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
flowing
rate
of
interest.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
most
convenient
place
to
find
the
statute
in
these
cases,
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
appendix
to
your
brief,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
well-settled
and
certainly
well
understood
proposition
that
the
drawing
of
a
check
for
a
deductible
purpose
is
a
deduction
at
the
moment
the
check
is
delivered
or
mailed?
justice
potter
stewart
one
is
a
side
draft
and
the
others
are
note,
each
depends
upon
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
could
be
bad
checks,
just
--
there
could
be
bad
notes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yeah,
i
know
the
purpose
and
that
--
that
is
to
beg
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
side
draft,
that's
what
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
to
withdraw
any
to
a
bank,
to
pay
to
the
order
of
the
endorsement
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
always
have,
i
know.
but
sometimes
it's
not
all
that
easy
to
make
the
distinction.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
one
can
order
to
a
(inaudible)
and
--
and
a
notice
much
more
personal
and
--
and
direct.
justice
potter
stewart
that
you
have
a
demand
note
if
you
promised
to
pay
right
now.
justice
potter
stewart
--
anytime
after
the
expiration.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
eckert
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
doesn't
the
--
i
can't
find
it,
but
doesn't
the
statute
or
the
regulation
specifically
refer
to
money
or
property?
i
thought
remember
that
from
reading
in
this
the
brief,
but
i
can't
find
it
now.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
--
considerations
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
--
there's
a
1974
law
that
takes
care
of
those
concerns
in
there.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
congress
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wanted
to
deal
with
and
meet
those
concerns
and
directly
did
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
it
did
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
--
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
but
surely
your
argument
today
doesn't
--
isn't
limited
to
cases
in
which
it
may
depend
upon
the
identity
of
the
trustees,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
company
had
deliberated
instead
of
a
note
one
of
its
corporate
bonds?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
--
there's
a
bond
that's
publicly
traded.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
know
it's
more
like
a
note
in
indebtedness,
it's
not
equity.
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
--
does
the
new
law,
the
1974
law,
make
it
illegal
and
not
makes
it
illegal
for
two,
purport
to
make
payment
by
the
note
of
the
employer?
how
about
the
--
does
it
make
it
illegal
to
make
payment
in
anything
other
than
cash
or
what
does
it
do?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
borrowing
of
money
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
the
--
by
the
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
cover
the
corporate
bond,
wouldn't
it
or
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
the
purchaser
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
a
bond
would
be
the
lender
--
a
lender
to
the
company,
i
guess.

potter
stewart
