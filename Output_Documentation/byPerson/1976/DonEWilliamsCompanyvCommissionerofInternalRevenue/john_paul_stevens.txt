but
counsel,
the
note
wasn't
payable
on
demand,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
it
was
payable
in
the
--
at
a
future
date.
justice
john

stevens
(inaudible)
justice

maybe
the
cost
of
the
money
went
down.
justice
john
paul
stevens
anyway,
the
company
had
elected
to
pay.
justice

mr.
schrager,
let
me
just
follow
up
on
my
misapprehension
of
the
facts
before.
am
i
correct
in
believing
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
the
note
were
not
payable
on
demand
but
had
a
value
at
least
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
do
you
rely
it
all
on
these
--
on
the
facts
that
the
principle
beneficiaries
and
the
trustees
of
the
trust
were
the
same
--
basically
the
same
people
as
the
obligor
the
note?
