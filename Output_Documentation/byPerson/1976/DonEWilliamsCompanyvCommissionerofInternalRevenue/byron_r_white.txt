mr.
schrager,
before
you
sit
down,
could
i
follow
up
in
one
of
my
earlier
questions.
these
notes
were
actually
paid
in
about
10
or
11
months.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
would
they
pay
them?
why
they
--
why
wasn't
payment
deferred
for
10
years
if
the
pension
from
the
fund
was
better
off
interest
payments
than
by
investment?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
would
have
the
cash
at
the
time
it
delivered
the
notes,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
record
doesn't
show
that
anywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
this
--
that
--
payors
will
be
treated
as
cash
basis
taxpayers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
--
i
gather
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
anticipating
the
rest
of
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
of
the
regulation
specifically
refer
property,
don't
they
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
--
let's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
the
stock
--
let's
say
the
stock
was
in
at&t.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
jones
i
didn't
--
you
mean
your
argument
in
--
in
the
court
here
really
does
depend
on
what
the
value
of
the
note
is?
i
thought
your
argument
is
only
independent
of
whether
--
that
even
--
you
make
the
--
even
if
the
note
was
concededly
was
more
than
the
--
than
the
amount
of
the
contribution,
was
it
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
wouldn't
make
much
difference
what
the
security
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no,
i
wasn't
talking
about
the
issue
into
the
stock.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
either
of
the
stock
was
secured
by
--
two
to
one
by
government
bonds,
you
would
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
note,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
you
stipulated
it,
you
can
go
to
the
bank
and
get
100%
on
the
note.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
affiliate
has
paid,
the
company
still
has
the
use
of
the
money
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so
as
the
asset
in
it.
