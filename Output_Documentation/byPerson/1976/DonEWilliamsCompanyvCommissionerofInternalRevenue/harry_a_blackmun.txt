justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
schrager,
am
correct
in
my
impression
that
the
note
actually
was
paid
within
10
or
11
months
later?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
there
a
--
perhaps
you
will
cover
it
as
you
go
along.
was
there
a
business
reason
for
the
deferral
of
actual
payment
when
it
followed
so
closely
upon
the
issuance
of
the
note?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
that
on
the
commissioner's
computations
anyway,
the
deduction
was
allowed
for
the
year
in
which
payment
was
made.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
we
come
down
really
to
which
year
that
you
end
up
getting
your
deduction.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
did
they
in
fact
invest
in
what,
treasury
bills
or
something?
didn't
--
didn't
you
indicate
one
reason
was
because
of
better
return
on
other
investments?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
isn't
this
--
the
natural
state
of
affairs
in
the
overlapping
of
a
cash
basis
in
a
--
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
--
it
isn't
peculiar
to
this
pension
plan
kind
of
thing,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
could
be
another
tangible
property
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
schrager,
can
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
in
your
brief
at
page
13,
you
say
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
the
notes
equaled
the
amount
of
the
claim
deduction.
now,
did
you
mean
to
say
that
the
equal
--
that
the
term
“market
value”
denotes
equal
(inaudible)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
record
to
tell
us
whether
or
not
the
fair
market
value
of
the
notes
at
the
time
of
their
delivery
to
the
trust
equaled
the
amount
of
the
obligation,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
not
concerned
about
the
error
in
the
brief.
i'm
concerned
about
the
--
about
the
element
of
fact.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
record
--
there
really
is
no
support
in
the
record
for
what
i'm
assuming
to
be
much
should
be
your
ultimate
contention
that
you
--
you
paid
by
property
having
value
at
least
equal
to
the
obligation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
but
that
i
suppose
to
be
opposed
to
the
notion
that
you
could
avoid
the
whole
problem
by
giving
them
the
cash
and
then
letting
him
come
back
and
buy
a
note
from
you,
which
would
have
been
payment
and
then
a
reinvestment
of
the
--
of
the
paid
funds.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
say
that's
too
much
trouble?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
it
--
is
it
in
the
stipulation
that
the
value
of
the
security
is
in
excess
to
the
value
of
the
note?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
--
and
plus
interest.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then,
what
is
the
value
of
the
note
when
it's
backed
up
by
security
like
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what
--
what's
the
security
behind
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
it
were
a
payment
to
a
pension
fund.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
guarantor.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
couldn't
have
been
paid
in
the
note
of
someone
else?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
here,
we
have,
with
that
note,
collateral
that
could
have
been
seized
via
the
notes,
presumably
on
an
attempt
of
the
note.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
exceeded
--
that
exceed
the
face
value
of
the
note.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
taxpayer
would
owe
the
people
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jones,
is
there
any
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
the
pipeline
now
that
favors
the
government
on
this
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
the
tax
court
is
kind
of
hopeless
for
taxpayers
issue.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
position
would
be
precisely
the
same
that
these
were
complete
strangers.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
the
symmetry
isn't
there
because
the
plan
is
exempt?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case
coming
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
an
accrual
basis
corporate
taxpayer.
it
has
a
qualified
employees
profit
sharing
trust.
the
issue
is
whether
the
taxpayer
corporation
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
under
section
404
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
when
it
delivers
a
fully
secured
promissory
demand
note
to
the
trustees
of
that
trust.
the
statute
allows
a
deduction
for
contributions
paid
by
an
employer
to
such
a
trust,
and
the
question
therefore
is
whether
payment
was
made
by
the
taxpayer
when
it
delivered
its
note
rather
than
cash
or
other
property.
the
united
states
tax
court
consistently
has
held
that
the
deduction
is
not
allowable.
the
third
and
the
ninth,
and
tenth
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
held
the
other
way,
and
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
present
case
agreed
with
the
tax
court,
so
we
took
the
case
to
resolve
the
conflict.
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
with
the
tax
court
on
the
seventh
circuit
and
disagree
with
the
other
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
statutory
term
"paid"
demonstrates
that
regardless
of
the
method
of
accounting.
the
taxpayer
must
payout
cash
or
its
equivalent
in
order
to
qualify
for
the
deduction
under
section
404
(a).
mr.
justice
stevens
has
--
joins
the
opinion
but
has
filed
a
concurring
statement
and
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
powell.
