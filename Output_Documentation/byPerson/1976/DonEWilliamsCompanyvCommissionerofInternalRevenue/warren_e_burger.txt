arguments
first
this
morning
in

mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
do
--
do
you
think,
mr.
schrager,
on
your
comment
on
the
use
of
the
word
paid,
did
only
four
lines
parts.
if
contributions
are
paid
by
an
employer
and
then
four
lines
down,
there
is
a
reference
or
compensation
is
paid,
do
you
think
the
word
“paid”
means
the
same
thing
in
an
operative
sense
in
each
of
those
lines?
chief

paying
compensation.
chief

e.
burger
mr.
schrager,
what
would
you
get
for
in
your
local
community?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right,
that
day
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
several
days
later?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
trustees
--
the
--
the
holders
of
the
note
who
could
make
the
demand,
make
the
decision
to
demand
where
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
only
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
--
if
it
came
down
to
that,
the
three
trustees
could
have
both
the
fourth
trustee,
could
they
not
on
the
trust
and
the
demand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
theoretically
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three
holders
cannot
vote
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
schrager.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
notes
are
promised
to
pay
in
the
future.
the
check
is
a
direction
to
pay
on
the
presentation.
chief

warren
e.
burger
so,
if
it
came
after
the
taxable
year,
it
would
be
out
and
it'd
be
on
the
same
category
as
this
note
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
same
analysis,
in
light
of
some
of
your
prior
responses,
the
bond
of
a
third-party
could
constitute
to
the
transfer
of
property.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

the
time
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

case
is
submitted.

justice

and
opinion
