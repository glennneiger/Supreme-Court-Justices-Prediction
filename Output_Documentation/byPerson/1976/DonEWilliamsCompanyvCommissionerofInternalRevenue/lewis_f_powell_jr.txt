f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume
that
the
stock
of
this
company
was
listed,
so
that
you
had
the
market
value
read
it
as
attainable
and
that
instead
of
getting
a
promissory
note,
the
taxpayer
had
discharged
its
indebtedness
as
if
you
need
to
by
delivering
the
appropriate
number
of
shares
of
its
own
stock
from
it's
treasury,

would
that
have
been
the
payment?

think
it
would
or
would
not?
