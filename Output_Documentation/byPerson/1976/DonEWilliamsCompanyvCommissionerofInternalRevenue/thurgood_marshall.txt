mr.
jones,
i
thought
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
the
check
is
that
the
bank
is
ordered
to
pay
the
money
if
there's
anything
in
that
--
in
that
account.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
one
of
the
questions,
guarantors
on
the
note
they
make
any
debt?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
keep
arguing
about
the
investment,
the
fund
holding
the
money,
what
about
the
equivalent
of
the
check
for
a
year
without
cash.
would
that
will
be
all
right?
