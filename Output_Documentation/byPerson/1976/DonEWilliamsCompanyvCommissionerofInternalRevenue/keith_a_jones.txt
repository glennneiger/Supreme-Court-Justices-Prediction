mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
schrager
has
indicated,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
delivers
its
promissory
note
to
an
employees'
profit-sharing
trust
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
under
section
404
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
that
statutory
provision
allows
for
a
deduction
for
contributions
to
such
trust
a
year
end
in
which
such
contributions
are
paid.
that's
the
narrow
issue
in
this
case,
it's
whether
the
delivery
of
the
note
constitutes
payment.
consider
--
excuse
me,
consideration
of
this
issue
is
assisted
by
two
limiting
propositions
on
which
there
can
be
a
little
basis
for
disagreement.
the
first
of
this
is
the
normal
accrual
basis
rules
do
not
apply
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
a
payment
under
section
404.
and
the
second
is
that
under
cash
basis
method
of
accounting,
the
delivery
of
a
promissory
note
does
not
constitute
payment.
these
two
propositions
taken
together
do
not
completely
dispose
of
this
case,
but
they
do
considerably
narrow
the
range
of
permissible
debate.
i
will
therefore
briefly
explain
why
these
propositions
are
sound
and
interned
to
the
discussion
of
the
area
of
disagreement
that
remains.
the
first
proposition,
as
i
have
indicated,
is
that
normal
accrual
basis
rules
do
not
apply
in
determining
whether
a
contribution
has
been
paid
for
purposes
of
section
404.
the
statute
provides
and
i
quote,
“a
taxpayer
on
the
accrual
basis
shall
be
deemed
to
have
made
a
payment
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
of
accrual.
if
the
payment
is
not
made
--
excuse
me,
is
made
not
later
than
the
time
prescribed
by
law
for
filing
the
return
for
such
year.”
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
the
--
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
on
page
33
of
our
brief.
if
accrual
basis
rules
have
applied,
the
deduction
would
always
have
been
available
for
the
year
of
accrual.
no
provision
such
as
the
one
that
i
have
just
quoted
would
have
been
necessary.
the
congress
understood
that
such
provision
was
necessary
to
permit
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
to
take
a
deduction
for
the
year
of
accrual
if
payment
was
not
in
fact
made
during
that
year.
and
the
provision
applies,
it
should
be
noted,
only
with
respect
to
payments
made
shortly
after
the
end
of
the
year
in
the
two
and
a
half
month
grace
period.
thus,
it's
plain
that
congress
understood
and
intended
that
the
normal
accrual
basis
rules
do
not
apply.
the
second
proposition
is
that
the
issuance
and
delivery
of
a
promissory
note
by
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
would
not
constitute
payment.
this
court
so
held
in
eckert
against
burnet
and
helvering
against
price,
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
uniformly
followed
these
decisions.
the
rationale
of
eckert
and
price
is
straightforward.
a
cash
basis
method
of
accounting
focuses
upon
movement,
inflows
and
outflows
of
cash
for
its
equivalent.
and
the
giving
of
a
promissory
note
or
an
iou
does
not
affect
an
outflow
of
property,
an
outflow
of
cash
for
its
equivalent.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
basically
eckert
and
price
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
basically,
eckert
and
price
rejected
the
argument
that
checks
are
to
be
treated
or
the
notes
are
to
be
treated
as
equivalent
to
check.
the
--
the
reasoning
seems
to
me
is
that
as
a
practical
accommodation
to
the
everyday
business
realities
of
--
or
everyday
realities
of
business
life,
the
payment
of
a
check
is
considered
to
be
equivalent
to
the
payment
of
cash.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
has
long
been,
i
know
it
is.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
my
--
that's
my
first
step,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
--
a
check
is
an
order
to
a
payment.
it's
an
order
to
a
bank
to
make
immediate
payment
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
it's
an
order
directing
a
bank
to
make
immediate
payment.
a
note
is
not
like
that
at
all.
when
the
maker
issues
a
note,
the
maker
himself
or
itself
still
has
something
left
to
do
before
the
basic
obligation
is
going
to
be
satisfied.
the
maker
himself
must
pay
the
note.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
that's
true,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
if
there's
no
bank
--
if
there's
no
money
in
the
bank
account
and
the
check
bounces,
then
of
course,
the
check
does
not
constitute
payment.
it's
a
common
law
doctrine
known
as
constructive
payment
in
relation
to
bank
or
conditional
payment
in
relation
to
bank
under
which
the
check
was
taken
as
payment.
but
--
but
the
note
did
not
direct
payment
in
that
way.
the
note
is
just
a
mere
promise
that
the
maker
himself,
not
the
bank,
is
going
to
make
payment
in
the
future
and
i've
always
been
treated
by
this
court
and
the
lower
courts
as
different
implication
as
to
tax
payers.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it's
really
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
it
--
it's
really
a
practical
distinction
that
a
note
and
a
check
is
the
conventional
mode
of
affecting
payment.
a
note
is
not
and
the
courts
have
drawn
the
distinction,
really
on
a
practical
rather
than
on
a
theoretical
basis.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
mr.
cheif
justice.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
a
promise
that
the
maker
will
pay
not
a
direction
to
the
bank
to
pay.
the
maker
still
has
to
pay
it
by
check.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
the
maker
paid
the
note
by
check
which
indicates
that
there's
a
difference,
a
very
real
practical
difference
between
the
two
transactions.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
would
think
that
--
i'm
going
to
make
sure
i
understand
you.
there's
a
30-day
--
it's
a
30
day
draft,
a
draft
that's
payable
within
30
days
or
the
expiration
of
30
days.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
think
that
that
would
only
be
payment
at
the
time
of
the
expiration
of
the
30-day
period.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
you're
asking
me
about
a
hypothetical,
but
i
really
haven't
very
much
thought
to
it,
but
i
think
that's
the
answer
that
i
would
give.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
true
or
if
it
were
payment
by
a
cash
basis
taxpayer.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
really,
i
was
--
at
this
point
advancing
the
proposition
that
the
delivery
of
a
note
is
not
payment
by
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
under
any
circumstances,
whether
it's
the
pension,
trust
or
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
to
any
other
creditor.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
eckert
and
price,
helvering
against
price.
petitioner
has
argued
this
similarity
between
checks
and
notes.
and
also
in
its
brief,
it's
argued
that
the
delivery
of
a
note
should
be
treated
as
equivalent
to
the
payment
of
cash
followed
by
receipt
of
the
cash
back
and
exchange
for
the
note.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
eckert
and
price
foreclosed
this
argument
as
well.
in
those
cases,
this
court
treated
the
delivery
of
a
note
as
the
delivery
of
a
note
and
not
as
the
end
result
of
some
series
of
hypothetical
transactions
that
never
took
place.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
what
i
said
at
the
outset.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
i
said
it
at
the
outset
that
i'm
really
advancing
two
limiting
propositions.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
recently
observed
on
behalf
of
the
court
in
the
national
alfalfa
case
and
i
quote,
“while
a
taxpayer
is
free
to
organize
his
affairs
as
he
chooses.
nevertheless,
once
having
done
so,
he
must
accept
the
tax
consequences
of
his
choice
whether
contemplated
or
not,
and
may
not
enjoy
the
benefit
of
some
other
route
he
might
have
chosen
to
follow
but
did
not.”
because
of
the
multiplicity
and
the
imperfection
of
possible
analogies
between
different
transactions,
the
courts
have
long
followed
the
doctrines
stated
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
a
taxpayer
must
accept
the
adverse
tax
consequences
of
the
form
in
which
he
cash
his
transaction
and
that
the
courts
will
not
re-cash
that
transaction
to
mitigate
the
tax
liability
that
he
has
incurred.
the
transaction
here
was
the
mere
giving
of
a
note,
not
the
payment
of
cash
followed
by
a
loan,
and
should
be
treated
as
what
it
was
and
not
as
what
it
was
not.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
that
the
fact
that
the
net
worth
of
the
guarantors
exceeded
the
face
value
of
the
note
that
provided
adequate
security.
under
section
503
of
the
code,
if
the
note
had
not
been
adequately
secured,
it
might
have
been
a
prohibited
transaction
that
would
have
resulted
in
the
lost
of
taxes,
so
i
think
that's
the
only
effect
from
our
point
of
view.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
there
were
three
forms
of
security.
one
was
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
stock
in
the
bank
or
stock
in
the
company.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
one
was
the
interest
of
the
certain
of
the
officers
and
their
share
in
the
pension
trust.
but
the
third
security,
which
we
think
is
the
most
relevant,
was
the
personal
liability
of
the
wife
of
mr.
williams,
personal
life
of
mrs.
williams
and
her
net
worth
apparently
was
about
four
times
that
of
the
value
of
the
note.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
it
would
be
payment,
mr.
justice
powell.
the
reason
i
briefly
hesitate
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
it
would
constitute
payment
if
it
were
shares
of
a
publicly
traded
corporation.
the
reason
i
hesitate
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
actual
payment
of
property,
i
think
that's
right.
sorry,
the
reason
i
hesitate
is
that
if
the
corporation
had
given
a
note
that
was
secured
by
stock
in
a
corporation,
i
think
the
commissioner
would
take
the
position
that
that
is
not
constitute
adequate
security
because
if
the
corporation
goes
bankrupt
the
stock
is
not
security.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
if
--
if
it
actually
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
as
long
as
--
as
long
as
the
pension
trustee
has
to
look
to
the
assets
of
the
company,
if
the
company
goes
bankrupt,
the
stock
is
not
going
to
be
very
helpful
because
it
is
subordinate
even
to
the
unsecured
liability
of
a
creditor.
however,
if
the
taxpayer
corporation
actually
transfers
the
stock
to
the
pension
trust,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
property.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
that's
right.
from
our
point
of
view,
the
market
value
of
the
note
is
irrelevant
to
the
--
the
question
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
the
difference
is
that
the
actual
issue
into
the
stock
does
decrease
the
holdings
of
the
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i'm
sorry.
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
even
if
the
notes
--
even
if
the
note
was
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
security
is
--
is
irrelevant
to
the
determination
whether
there's
a
deductible
contribution.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
especially
in
circumstances
such
as
we
have
here.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
hasn't
given
up
anything,
(inaudible)
other
than
a
promise
to
give
up
something
in
the
future.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
that
would
be
paid
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
well,
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
never
been
an
issue
in
stock
that's
been
litigated,
but
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
the
regulation
does.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
now,
cash
or
it's
equivalent
property.
that's
correct.
there's
no
question
about
it
and
it
was
so
held
in
colorado
case
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
that's
true,
if
it
were
someone
else's
note
that
would
constitute
payment.
we're
just
focusing
here
on
the
question
of
the
taxpayers
now,
which
we
say,
it
does
not
give
up
anything,
any
property
of
the
taxpayer,
so
yes.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
although
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
--
that
collateral
would
have
not
come
out
of
the
taxpayer.
there's
no
reason
to
give
a
taxpayer
deduction
for
the
payment
of
collateral
of
some
third
party
sense.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we're
hypothesizing
a
situation
which
the
taxpayer
is
bankrupt,
i
suppose,
so
otherwise
the
--
the
requirement
for
collateral
probably
--
i
mean
the
collateral
would
probably
never
have
to
be
reached.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
we
do
think
that's
important
mr.
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
if
i
can
develop
our
affirmative
arguments
under
section
404,
the
relevance
to
that
will
become
clearer.
but
to
summarize
my
argument
up
to
this
point,
we
think
petitioner
finds
itself
between
(inaudible)
that
is
the
accrual
basis
method
of
accounting
is
not
available
under
section
404.
but
under
the
cash
basis
method
of
accounting,
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
deductions
and
claims.
now,
petitioner,
per
force,
must
argue
as
it
has
that
congress
intended
to
permit
accrual
basis
taxpayers
to
utilize
a
hybrid
or
intermediate
method
of
accounting
for
purposes
of
section
404,
and
our
position
to
the
contrary
is
that
congress
intended
to
place
all
taxpayers
on
the
same
footing
for
purposes
of
this
provision
that
cash
basis
rules
govern.
we
rely
from
the
legislative
history,
language
of
the
statute,
statutes
over
right
purpose
and
considerations
of
administrability.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
administrability.
a
legislative
history
in
the
statutory
language
admittedly
are
not
conclusive
but
they
are,
we
submit,
highly
suggestive.
a
witness
before
the
senate
finance
committee
testified
apparently
without
contradiction
that,
“the
law
has
been
drafted
in
such
a
way
that
all
corporations
are
put
on
a
cash
basis
on
the
payment
to
trust.”
the
senate
and
house
committee
reports
refer
to
a
requirement
of
actual
payment
which
is
a
cash
basis
concept,
but
the
statute
itself
refers
to
the
requirement
of
a
payment.
now,
the
construction
of
this
term
“payment,”
which
at
least
allude
to
cash
basis
rules,
must
be
informed
by
an
inquiry
into
the
underlying
legislative
objective.
in
enacting
section
404,
and
i
think
this
point
is
crucial,
congress
was
not
principally
concerned
with
providing
a
precise
measure
of
the
taxpayer's
economic
net
income.
section
404
predominately
reflects
non-tax
concerns
related
to
the
general
social
welfare.
congress
understood
that
millions
of
workers
depend
on
their
employer's
pension
plans
for
a
large
portion
of
their
retirement
income,
and
we
submit
that
congress
sought
to
ensure
the
financial
viability
of
those
plans
by
encouraging
employers
to
make
their
contributions
in
cash
for
it's
equivalent,
and
if
it
did
so
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
true
as
to
the
future,
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
have
about
116
cases
pending
for
the
past
and
we're
talking
about
what
interpretation
should
properly
be
given
to
the
statute
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
prior
cases.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
is
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
it
is
now
done
so
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
is
now
dow
so
more
fully.
but
erisa
does
constitute
an
amendment
to
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
to
my
knowledge,
this
case
has
not
been
decided
in
a
court
of
appeals
since
the
williams'
case,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
pending,
either
in
the
tax
court
or
an
administrative
stage.
but
so
far
as
i
know,
there's
been
no
subsequent
court
of
appeals
action.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
but
nevertheless
this
taxpayer
and
many
others
have
continued
to
go
there.
there
is
an
advantage
as
you
know.
in
other
words,
we
believe
that
congress'
purpose
in
requiring
a
payment
was
to
ensure
that
the
employees'
trust
would
secure
the
full
advantage
of
any
contribution
for
which
a
tax
benefit
in
a
form
of
a
deduction
was
made
available
to
the
employer.
a
petitioner
argues,
and
i
tell
you
this
is
part
of
the
essence
to
this
argument,
that
that
purpose
is
sufficiently
served
by
the
delivery
to
the
trust
of
a
note
having
value.
that
argument
and
this
is
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens
to
your
question,
that
argument
seems
to
us
overlooks
the
fact,
the
trust
and
the
employer
are
ordinarily
not
dealing
at
arms
length
in
situations
such
as
this.
often,
as
it's
true
here,
a
majority
of
the
trustees
are
also
officers
of
the
corporation
and
there
can
be
no
assurance
that
such
trustees
will
treat
the
note
in
its
hands,
a
salable
property,
as
far
more
likely
we
submit
that
they
will,
as
the
trustees
here
did,
hold
the
note
until
the
corporation
itself
is
willing
and
able
to
make
payment.
but
this
course
of
action
jeopardizes
the
interest
of
the
affected
employees
that
congress
sought
to
protect.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
that's
--
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
frequently
true
that
the
trust
which
after
all
is
established
by
the
corporation
will
have
trustees
that
are
also
officers
in
the
corporation.
indeed,
it
would
be
surprising
if
that
was
not
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
as
to
section
404,
that's
true,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
we
think
that
the
term
“payment”
would
have
to
have
the
same
meaning
in
all
the
situations
in
which
it
was
applied
under
section
404.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
a
difficult
question,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
speak
for
the
commissioner.
so
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
ruling
directly
on
point.
i
--
i
think
that
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
bond
is
--
is
more
properly
analogous
to
a
note
than
it
is
to
the
corporate
stock
and
it
would
not
be
treated
as
payment
for
the
purposes
of
section
404.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
to
avoid
problems
of
administrability,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
a
commissioner
would
probably
seek
to
avoid
a
case
by
case
determination
of
whether
a
particular
bond
was
more
like
a
note
or
more
like
a
share
of
stock.
but
--
as
i
say
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
mean
more
like
a
note
for
purposes
of
this
provision.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
analytically,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
treat
the
bond
as
a
note.
but
as
i
say,
i
--
i
cannot
speak
for
the
commissioner
because
i'm
unaware
of
any
ruling
to
that
effect
and
i'm
not
sure
what
decision
he
would
do.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
there's
no
question
about
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
a
taxpayer
holds
the
bond
of
a
third
party,
that's
property
in
his
hands
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
when
he
gives
it
over
to
the
trust,
he's
actually
giving
a
property.
we
think
that
congress'
purpose
in
this
provision
can
be
fully
served
only
by
requiring
an
actual
out
layer
transfer
of
cash
or
property
from
the
employer
to
the
trust,
but
when
the
employer
holds
the
property
in
the
form
of
a
note
of
the
third-person
and
transfers
it
over,
that
would
be
sufficient
in
our
view.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
again,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
only
reason
a
check
is
treated
as
equivalent
as
cash
are
practical
reasons,
theoretically.
i
mean
if
you
--
if
you
only
adhere
to
theories,
you
would
treat
it
a
check,
not
as
cash
but
like
a
note.
but
as
a
practical
matter
to
accommodate
what
actually
goes
on
in
the
marketplace,
the
commissioner
does
what
the
taxpayers
do
which
is
to
treat
a
check
as
cash
until
it's
approved
otherwise.
well,
finally
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
to
my
knowledge,
it
does
not.
i
--
i
think
that
they
only
prohibit
transactions
with
which
we're
concerned
here
is
the
loan
of
money
or
its
equivalent
from
the
trust
back
to
the
employer,
then
the
new
law
treats
the
payment
of
the
note
or
the
delivery
of
a
note
in
the
first
place
is
equivalent
to
loan.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
as
far
as
i
know,
nothing
prohibit
the
transfer
his
real
estate.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
has
a
purpose
--
the
purpose
is
to
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
protect
the
financial
viability
of
the
trust
and
that
purpose
is
best
served
by
making
its
investments
independent
of
the
employer.
self-employer
suffers
financial
that
whether
the
trust
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
will
nevertheless,
that's
right.
all
these
considerations,
we
submit,
point
toward
the
uniform
application
of
cash
basis
rules
under
section
404.
the
cash
basis
method
of
accounting
affords
a
fair,
objective,
easily
administrable
set
of
rules
to
further
the
underlined
statutory
purposes.
it
was
therefore
reasonable
for
the
commissioner
to
construe
the
statute
is
requiring
actual
payment,
cash
or
its
equivalent.
and
we
submit
that
this
longstanding
interpretation
by
the
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
statute
should
be
sustained.
now,
petitioner's
argument
for
a
different
treatment
for
special
treatment
for
accrual
basis
taxpayers,
rest
almost
exclusively
upon
an
analogy
to
section
267,
a
section
which
we
believe
is
not
relevant
here.
broadly
speaking,
that
provision
deals
with
transactions
between
related
taxpayers,
and
those
familiar
example
may
be
the
wage
expense
incurred
by
an
accrual
basis
corporation
tying
one
of
its
cash
basis
shareholders.
section
267
provides
that
the
corporation
is
entitled
to
a
deduction
on
account
of
the
wages
only
if
they
are
paid.
now,
early
in
the
history
of
the
predecessor
of
this
provision,
the
lower
federal
courts
in
these
circumstances
held
that
the
delivery
of
a
note
to
the
shareholder
constituted
payment
because
the
note
was
income
to
the
cash
basis
shareholder.
and
in
1953,
congress
amended
the
statute
to
ensure
that
deduction
--
that
the
deduction
would
be
available
only
if
the
income
was
in
fact
realized
by
the
cash
basis
recipient.
and
after
that
amendment,
the
commissioner
acquiesced
in
the
earlier
decisions,
but
in
doing
so,
explicitly
distinguished
between
section
267
and
section
404.
well,
this
history
does
not
support
the
petitioner's
construction
for
section
404.
the
meaning
of
the
term
“paid”
in
section
267
turns
on
the
specific
purpose
of
creating
symmetry
in
the
treatment
of
related
taxpayers
and
that
is
the
result
that
has
been
achieved.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
true,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
now,
the
petitioner,
in
his
reply
to
the
belief,
says,
“well,
section
267
and
404
really
are
similar
because
(b)(9)
of
267
applies
the
certain
charitable
organizations.
but
the
history
or
the
purpose
of
section
267(b)(9)
as
its
legislative
history
plainly
shows
is
to
prevent
the
deduction
of
losses
on
the
sale
of
property
to
a
charitable
organization
controlled
by
the
seller.
and
the
rationale
of
that
provision
is
that
since
the
seller
attains
effective
control
of
the
property,
he
should
not
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
a
loss
deduction.
but
that
consideration
lends
nothing,
sheds
no
light
on
the
meaning
of
the
term
“paid”
and
either
section
267
or
404.
my
final
point
is
that
the
proper
analogy
here
is
not
the
section
267
but
to
section
170,
which
allows
in
language
virtually
identical
to
that
of
section
404,
a
deduction
for
contributions
paid
to
charitable
organizations.
the
term
“paid”
is
used
in
section
170
as
it
is
in
section
404
to
ensure
that
the
tax
exempt
recipient
of
the
contribution
will
obtain
a
substantial
present
benefit,
not
just
the
promise
of
a
future
benefit
as
a
the
result
of
the
transaction
giving
rise
to
the
tax
deduction.
for
that
reason,
section
170
has
always
been
interpreted
as
requiring
more
than
the
giving
of
a
promissory
note.
the
same
result
for
the
same
reason
is
appropriate
here.
congress
intended
that
the
taxpayer
should
part
for
something
more
than
its
bear
promise
to
part
with
something
in
the
future
for
obtaining
the
benefit
of
a
deduction.
now,
petitioner
gave
only
its
promise,
not
as
property,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
denying
the
deduction
should
therefore
be
affirmed.
