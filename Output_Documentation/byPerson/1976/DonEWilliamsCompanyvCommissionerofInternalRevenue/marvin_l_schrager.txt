mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
marvin
l.
schrager
and
this
is
durward
j.
long,
co-counsel
for
the
don
e.
williams
company.
the
don
e.
williams
company
is
located
in
moline,
illinois
and
engages
in
the
sale
of
small
tools.
the
corporation
maintains
its
books
in
an
accrual
basis
method
of
accounting
and
also
has
an
employees'
profit-sharing
plan
for
the
benefit
of
its
company
employees.
the
company
has
a
fiscal
year
ending
april
30th,
and
according
to
the
accrual
method
of
accounting,
must
file
its
tax
return
on
or
before
july
15th
of
each
year.
for
the
years
april
30,
1967,
1968
and
1969
the
board
of
directors
of
the
corporation
before
the
end
of
the
year,
accrued
a
liability
for
the
employees'
profit-sharing
plan.
subsequent
to
the
end
of
the
corporation
fiscal
year,
but
prior
to
the
time
for
the
filing
of
the
tax
return,
the
company
transferred
to
the
trustees
of
the
profit-sharing
plan
a
secured
demand
interest-bearing
note
of
the
corporation
guaranteed
by
the
president,
vice-president,
and
treasurer
of
the
company.
it
was
--
has
been
stipulated
that
the
value
of
the
collateral
and
net
worth
of
one
of
the
guarantors
exceeded
the
value
of
the
note
which
was
the
amount
of
the
claim
deduction.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
i
think
the
note
was
paid
within
approximately,
as
you
say
it,
10
or
11
months
and
at
that
time,
there
were
several
reasons.
one
of
which
was
that
the
company
was
an
expanding
company
and
it's
in
capital
intense
and
needs
a
lot
of
inventory.
and
also,
they
felt
that
the
company
was
a
good
place
to
invest
the
money
and
pay
as
good
a
return
as
they
would
be
getting
and
investing
in
the
stocks
or
some
other
investment.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
that
is
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
right,
and
set
forth
in
our
factual
situation,
you
will
note
that
the
first
year
is
the
largest
denial
of
the
deduction
and
it
becomes
correspondingly
less
because
he
allowed
the
deduction
for
the
cash
that
was
paid
the
following
year.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
well,
the
corporation
paid
interests
to
the
profit-sharing
plan
and
they
felt
that
in
the
years
in
question,
this
would
be
as
good
return
as
they
would
get
by
investing
elsewhere.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
service,
upon
examination,
disallowed
the
claim
deduction
contending
that
the
transfer
of
the
note
in
satisfaction
of
the
accrued
liability
did
not
constitute
payment
under
section
404
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
after
the
denial,
the
petitioner
filed
a
case
in
the
tax
court
and
after
all
of
the
facts
were
stipulated
to
arguments
and
briefs
submitted,
the
tax
court
as
it
has
consistently
done,
reaffirmed
the
commissioner
and
denied
the
deduction.
an
appeal
was
then
taken
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
after
arguments,
the
court
of
appeals
held
for
the
commissioner,
but
by
doing
so,
they
declined
to
follow
decisions
of
the
third,
ninth
and
tenth
circuit
which
had
previously
held
that
the
transfer
of
a
note
by
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
did
constitute
payment
under
section
404
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
if
the
transfer
was
made
and
the
delivery
was
made
within
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
close
of
the
taxpayer's
fiscal
year.
this
created
a
split
in
the
circuits
and
we
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted
by
this
court
and
that's
the
basic
issue.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not,
as
i've
stated,
the
transfer
or
delivery
of
a
note
by
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
constitutes
payment
of
an
accrued
liability
to
a
profit-sharing
plan
if
made
within
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
close
of
the
taxpayer's
fiscal
year.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
an
interest-bearing
note.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
different
rates
that
corresponded
to
the
rates
that
were
being
charged
by
banks
in
our
local
community,
and
the
rates
would
differ
from
the
larger
money
senders.
they
don't
--
they
don't
fluctuate
quite
as
much.
in
dealing
with
the
issue,
i
believe
that
we
have
to
talk
about
three
sections
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
first,
section
162,
which
provides
for
the
deduction
of
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses
which
are
paid
or
incurred
by
the
taxpayer.
we
also
must
deal
with
section
267
which
--
which
refers
to
deductions
which
are
allowed
when
paid
and
section
267
deals
with
related
taxpayers.
we
also
are
dealing
with
section
404
which
deals
with
contributions
to
an
employee's
pension
or
profit-sharing
plan,
and
which
also
contains
the
language
that
the
deduction
is
allowed
when
paid.
the
reason
that
we
have
to
take
into
consideration
these
three
sections
is
that
were
not
for
the
express
establishment
of
these
sections,
the
deduction
would
have
been
allowable
under
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
we
maintain
that
contributions
to
an
employee's
pension
or
profit-sharing
plan
are
considered
as
additional
employee
compensation,
and
should
--
and
would
be
covered
under
162
were
it
not
for
section
404.
now,
prior
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
below,
20
years
of
case
law
have
treated
section
404
and
section
267
and
their
predecessors
which
23
(p)
is
the
predecessor
--
predecessor
to
section
404
and
section
24
(c)
is
the
predecessor
to
section
267.
and
case
law
has
treated
them
synonymously,
and
we
feel
that
this
is
important
in
following
the
evolution
of
the
point
where
we
are
today.
petitioner
maintains
that
first,
section
267
was
established
by
congress
and
then
section
404
was
established
by
congress
to
stop
tax
avoidance
and
to
close
a
tax
loophole
that
existed
under
the
internal
revenue
code
for
the
following
reason.
suppose
that
i
am
the
president
and
--
and
stockholder
of
a
close
corporation,
the
corporation
is
on
a
fiscal
year
and
on
an
accrual
basis
method
of
accounting.
i,
as
the
president,
would
be
on
a
cash
basis.
under
section
162,
the
corporation
could
have
accrued
a
liability
to
me,
say,
i
got
a
salary
and
a
bonus.
they
could
have
paid
me
the
salary
and
accrued
the
bonus
but
never
paid
it.
and
therefore,
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
deduction.
i,
as
a
cash
basis
taxpayer,
not
having
received
the
money,
would
not
have
to
report
that
on
my
income
tax
return
until
the
year
that
it
was
paid.
if
i
never
took
the
money
out
of
the
corporation,
i
would
never
have
to
show
it.
they
would
just
keep
it
as
an
accrued
liability
but
would
have
taken
the
deduction.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
it
is
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
it
was,
justice
blackmun,
until
such
time
that
section
267
was
established
at
which
time
they
stated
that
certain
related
taxpayers
if
you
accrued
it,
it
must
be
paid
within
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
end
of
the
year.
and
i
must
take
it
into
income
at
that
time,
if
you
were
an
independent
creditor
of
the
company
or
a
non-owner
employee,
they
could
have
accrued
the
--
accrued
the
liability
taken
the
deduction
but
you
would
not
have
to
report
it
until
received.
but
i
as
a
related
taxpayer,
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
must
show
an
income
within
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
end
of
the
year.
it
must
be
paid
within
that
time.
this
was
the
reason
that
267,
we
feel,
was
enacted
by
congress
to
close
that
tax
loophole
between
related
taxpayers.
subsequently,
we
feel
that
section
404
was
also
enacted
to
do
the
same
thing
with
employee
profit-sharing
plans.
we
feel
that
congress
felt
that
because
of
the
possible
closeness
and
relationship
between
the
owner
and
maybe
the
trustees
of
the
plan
that
they
felt
that
something
must
be
paid
within
two
and
a
half
months
that
you
must
transfer
something
of
value
must
be
transferred
and
delivered
to
the
trustees
of
the
profit-sharing
plan.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
it
is
not
a
taxpayer
because
of
the
grace
of
congress,
however
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
we
feel
it
is,
your
honor,
because
it's
quite
conceivable
that
i,
as
a
owner
of
a
corporation,
could
have
accrued
the
liability
to
the
employees'
profit-sharing
plan,
but
if
i
never
paid
it,
but
took
the
deduction
when
the
employees
went
to
retire,
there
maybe
nothing
in
there
but
just
an
accrual
on
the
books
of
the
corporation.
and
prior
to
the
enactment
of
erisa,
many
corporations,
small
corporations,
the
shareholder
was
the
sole
trustee
of
the
plan.
and
i
think
that
there
was
this
type
of
related
taxpayer
basis
between
the
owner
and
the
corporation
that
they
were
trying
to
stop
potential
misdealings
and
they
wanted
something
actually
delivered
to
the
trustees
of
the
plan,
so
that
an
employee
in
seeing
the
plan
could
know
that
something
was
there.
and
also,
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
corporate
--
the
trustees
of
the
plan
are
obligated
to
file
annual
reports
showing
the
assets
of
the
plan.
the
--
in
this
area,
there
has
been
much
litigation,
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
service
starting
with
section
267
and
following
through
with
section
404,
has
always
maintained
in
the
beginning
that
paid,
meant
paid
in
cash.
you
had
to
liquidate
the
obligation
in
cash.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
their
wording
was
cash
or
cash
value.
in
1943,
the
case
of
musselman
hub-brake
company
versus
commissioner
dealt
with
an
accrual
basis
corporation
owing
its
controlling
stockholder
a
debt
for
royalties
and
interests
which
were
accrued
on
--
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
notes
were
transferred
within
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
end
of
each
year.
the
corporation
took
a
deduction
and
the
commissioner
disallowed
it
stating
that
notes
paid
--
notes
did
not
constitute
payment
under
--
and
that
was
section
24
(c)
which
was
the
predecessor
to
section
267
in
that
case.
the
court
of
--
the
tax
court
affirmed
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
overturned
and
ruled
that
paid
included
the
transfer
of
a
note,
the
delivery
of
a
note,
that
a
note
constituted
payment
under
section
24
(c)
for
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer.
in
that
case,
they
talked
about
the
things
which
i
have
talked
about
today,
the
tax
avoidance
and
the
history
of
why
they
wanted
to
establish
this
section.
and
they
also,
in
addition
stated
that
if
were
not
for
24
(c),
this
would
have
been
deductible
under
24
(a).
in
holding
for
the
taxpayer,
musselman
hub-brake
company,
the
court
explicitly
rejected
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
service
position
that
accrual
basis
and
cash
basis
taxpayers
were
on
equal
footing
under
section
24
(c).
and
this
is
one
of
the
main
themes
of
our
argument
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
and
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer.
they
are
not
on
equal
footing
and
they
are
not
so
treated
by
the
internal
revenue
code.
and
in
the
musselman
case,
they
rejected
the
argument
and
refused
to
follow
the
cases
of
eckert
v.
burnet
and
helvering
versus
price
which
is
the
basis
for
the
commissioner's
argument
in
those
cases
and
also
in
the
case
before
you
today.
following
the
musselman
hub-brake
company
case,
the
court
in
anthony
p.
miller
versus
commissioner,
which
is
a
case
following
the
example
that
i
gave
to
you
before,
held
that
a
corporation
which
transferred
notes
to
its
president
within
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
of
the
corporation
constituted
payment
under
section
24
(c)
which
is
the
predecessor
to
section
267.
they
felt
that
the
delivery
of
the
note
completed
the
transaction
and
relationships
between
the
parties
changed
as
of
that
time.
they
also
felt
in
that
case
that
a
note
was
similar
to
a
check
and
they
again
rejected
the
eckert
and
the
price
line
of
cases.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes.
well,
i
don't
know
if
there
is
exactly
a
dispute
there,
your
honor
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
we're
dealing
here
--
first
of
all,
we
think
that
the
uniform
commercial
code
argument
is
--
is
very
miniscule.
i
think
we're
dealing
here
with
the
matter
of
federal
law
and
federal
practice
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
we
maintained
that
if
--
if
we're
going
to
get
into
the
uniform
commercial
code,
then
the
illinois
code
should
be
the
one
that's
applicable
and
they
defined
both
checks
and
negotiable
notes
as
negotiable
instruments,
and
that
they
both
suspend
the
underlying
debt
pro
tanto
until
the
time
of
payment.
finally,
after
the
musselman
and
the
miller
cases
in
revenue
ruling
55-608,
the
commissioner
acquiesced
to
the
decisions
and
the
line
of
reasoning
in
those
cases
and
they
state
where
a
solvent
taxpayer
on
the
accrual
basis
issued
its
notes
or
other
evidence
of
indebtedness
constituted
a
valid
deduction.
we
feel
that
at
that
point
in
time,
the
commissioner
in
that
also
acquiescing
in
the
section
404
line
of
cases
created
an
inconsistent
position
and
a
conflict
which
we
feel
was
wrong
and
untenable.
we
feel
that
if
it
constitutes
paid
under
section
267
to
have
consistency,
it
should
be
paid
under
section
404
(a),
and
a
taxpayer
should
know
what
he's
dealing
with
in
reading
the
language
of
the
code.
we
do
not
feel
that
and
we
also
feel
that
when
they
acquiescence
in
that
section
in
talking
about
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer,
that
they
can't
argue
that
accrual
basis
means
one
thing
under
267,
but
in
section
404,
accrual
and
cash
basis
are
identical.
we
don't
feel
that
that's
a
valid
argument.
after
decisions
and
the
acquiescence,
we
then
get
into
the
area
of
cases,
dealing
specifically
with
section
404.
the
first
case
to
come
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
really
a
consolidation
of
two
cases,
the
sachs
case
and
the
slaymaker
lock
company
case.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
corporation
transferred
to
the
trustees
demand
notes
of
the
corporation
in
satisfaction
of
its
accrued
liability
to
its
pension
trust.
the
tax
court,
after
hearing
arguments
by
both
parties,
disallowed
the
deduction
and
affirmed
the
commissioner's
ruling.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decisions
and
felt
that
transfer
of
the
note
did
constitute
payment
within
the
meaning
of
section
23
(p),
the
predecessor
to
section
404.
they
felt
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
i
--
i
think
you're
dealing
--
one
is
paying
it
in
the
plan,
the
other
paying
a
bonus
to
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
paying
compensation.
i
think
that
--
yes,
when
they're
talking
about
paying
compensation
to
somebody,
i
think
its
clear
that
if
i
give
an
employee
a
note
that
they
must
report
it
as
income
and
that's
paid.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
as
the
tax
--
the
tax
--
the
cash
basis
taxpayer,
if
you
are
the
payor,
you
are
not
allowed
a
deduction
under
the
code
until
you
pay
in
cash.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
we
have
not
dealt
with
--
and
there
have
been
no
cases
decided,
your
honor,
wherein
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
--
has
delivered
the
note
and
taken
a
claim
deduction
in
this
area
of
cases.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
well,
maybe
it
could.
we're
not
--
we're
not
making
that
argument,
your
honor
(voice
overlap)
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
a
mere
accrual
of
what?
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
a
mere
accrual
of
the
profit-sharing
contribution?
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
that
is
correct.
we
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
no,
we
feel
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
under
section
162
deduction,
yes,
it
would.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
we
concede,
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
well,
we
can
get
into
the
--
we
feel
that
the
word
“paid”
means
delivery
of
something.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
the
courts
in
eckert
v.
price
have
held,
of
course,
that
was
the
only
--
the
bad
debt
deduction
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
--
but
they
have
held
in
that
case,
no.
and
there
has
been
some
--
there
have
been
some
cash-basis
cases
i
think
mainly
in
the
--
in
the
gift
area
where
they
have
held
that
a
cash
basis
taxpayer.
no,
i
don't
know.
i
think
some
of
those
are
on
appeal
now,
but
to
date,
they
have
never
held
that
it
qualify
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
to
give
a
note
but
they
have
for
accrual
basis
(voice

mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
in
three
courts
of
appeals
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
--
it
did,
your
honor.
in
three
courts
of
appeals,
it
has
prevailed
and
also
we
feel
that
under
their
acquiescence
in
section
267,
the
commissioner
has
acknowledged
the
difference
between
cash
and
accrual
basis
taxpayers.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
correct.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
that
--
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yeah,
there
is
--
there
has
been
some
discussion
about
in
the
regulations
talking
about
the
word
or
was
in
the
congressional
report
prior
to
the
time
that
the
final
draft
of
the
section
came
out
talking
about
the
word
“actually
paid”.
and
the
commissioner
has
maintained
that
actually
means
paid
in
cash.
we
contend
that
if
the
word
“actually”
has
any
significant
meaning
at
all
that
it
means
that
you
actually
delivered
something
of
value.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
that's
correct.
if
you've
paid
it,
you
have
paid
it.
and
actually
paid
has
really
no
significance
to
that.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
your
honor,
that
was
a
misinterpretation.
i
thought
i
have
corrected
that,
and
it
was
brought
to
attention
by
counsel.
the
stipulation
was
that
the
value
of
the
collateral
and
the
net
worth
of
one
of
the
guarantors
exceeded
the
value
of
the
note.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
no.
that
was
an
error,
your
honor,
in
our
brief.
we
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
equal
to
the
obligation
and
it
was
in
one
of
the
--
and
this
has
been
decided
in
--
i
believe,
it
was
one
of
--
either
the
sachs
or
the
slaymaker
case
and
in
the
several
cases
that
followed
as
they
were
remanded
for
a
hearing
on
the
value
of
the
notes
in
those
cases
so
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
that
has
been
covered.
and
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
made
by
counsel
that
it
places
a
burden
on
the
commissioner
to
have
to
make
valuations,
we
contend
that
the
internal
revenue
service
is
making
valuations
everyday
on
corporate
stock
and
evaluations
of
gifts.
in
the
colorado
national
bank
case,
they
transferred
real
estate
and
they
found
a
way
to
value
that.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
well,
yes,
we
feel
that
--
that
they're
making
it
tougher
and
tougher
on
the
small
companies
to
do
this
and
i
think
after
they
--
they
want
to
get
into
philosophy
but
after
they
enacted
erisa
which
was
suppose
to
solve
all
the
problems.
well,
it
solved
many
of
them
because
a
lot
of
the
small
corporations
canceled
their
plans.
so,
instead
of
benefitting
the
people,
they
ended
up
hurting
them
again
because
they
weren't
going
to
--
they
didn't
want
all
of
the
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
i
believe
that
--
yes,
that
is
and
it's
also
contained
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes,
it's
all
--
they
paid
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
we
believe
that
it's
worth
the
base
amount
of
the
claim
deduction,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
oh,
100%
on
the
value
of
this
company's
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes.
well,
even.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
--
even
with
the
balance
sheet
--
you
know
that's
not
in
--
i
don't
want
to
get
off
on
the
things
that
aren't
in
the
record
but
even
on
the
balance
sheet
of
this
company
or
(voice
overlap).
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes,
it
was.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
it
was
paid
at
a
future
date,
justice
stevens,
but
it
was
a
demand
note.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
secure
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
three
officers
of
the
company
plus
a
bank.there
was
an
independent
trustee.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
only
one,
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
theoretically,
yes,
they
could.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
right,
it's
factual,
they
could.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes.
the
other
cases
that
supported
the
petitioner's
position
were
the
wasatch
chemical
company
case,
another
case
involving
a
profit-sharing
plan
in
which
notes
were
transferred
to
the
trustees
and
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
paid
or
payment
does
not
necessarily
mean
in
cash.
payment
was
made
when
the
note
was
delivered.
there
was
a
significant
change
in
legal
relationships
between
the
parties
and
their
real
question
and
issue
in
that
case
was
what
was
the
value
of
the
note
transferred,
was
it
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
claim
deduction.
they
felt
that
that
was
the
real
issue.
and
for
20
years
before
this
case
was
decided,
that
was
the
state
of
the
law,
and
we
felt
that
it
was
rightly
so
and
even
justice
quigley
in
his
dissenting
opinion
felt
that
taxpayers
had
a
right
to
rely
on
20
years
of
established
law.
my
time
is
running
out.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
talk
about
the
--
which
i
touched
down
is
erisa
and
since
the
enactment
of
erisa
and
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
the
case
doesn't
have
any
perspective
meaning
because
it
is
now
a
prohibited
transaction.
but
it
does
have
meaning
to
this
taxpayer
and
it
also
has
meaning
to
settle
the
conflict
between
the
circuits
as
it
now
stands.
we
feel
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
the
company
had
the
cash
and
paid
at
--
in
at
that
time,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes,
i
don't
know
exactly
--
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
pardon?
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
that
was
in
1967.
i
don't
know
the
reason
then,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
schrager
yes,
there
--
i
believe
one
of
the
cases,
i
think
it
was
the
wasatch
case
had
time
notes,
your
honor,
and
the
same
line
of
reasoning
followed
in
the
decision.
they
didn't
care
in
that
case
exactly
when
it
was
paid
as
long
as
it
had
value.
thank
you.
