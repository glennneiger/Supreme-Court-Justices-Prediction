unknown
speaker
maybe
i
misunderstood,
but
as
i
understood
my
brother
white's
question
it
was
directed,
or
at
least
my
question
is
directed
to
this
proposition.
why
is
the
fact
that
a
widow
or
a
widower
may
have
received
more
than
one
half
of
his
support
during
the
lifetime
of
his
spouse,
from
his
spouse
relevant
to
his
present
neediness?
unknown
speaker
it
is
really
equivalence,
isn't
it,
or
it
could
be
non-equivalence,
isn’t
that
the
case?
unknown
speaker
there
is
always
in
fact
a
discrimination
against
females.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
position.
unknown
speaker
how,
in
fact
you
should
use
this
court's
opinion
in
shevin
against
kahn
into
this
follow
through
you
are
having
with
my
brothers.
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
survive
a
constitutional
certainly
here.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
ginsburg
speaking
of
the
test
which
is
to
be
of
my
understanding
that
has
not
been
a
holding
or
a
decision
of
a
majority
of
the
full
court
that
says
in
so
many
words
that
sex
is
a
suspect
classification.
would
you
say
that
the
existing
precedents
from
this
court
requires
sex
to
be
scrutinized
more
or
less
carefully
than
a
classification
based
on
illegitimacy
such
as
the
one
in
mathews
against
lucas
last
term?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
question
is
which
is
the
strictest
scrutiny,
sex
or
illegitimacy
in
your
construction
of
our
case?
unknown
speaker
yeah
that
case
upheld
the
classification
largely
on
a
justification
of
administrative
convenience,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
classification
of
illegitimacy.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
ginsburg
let
me
come
back
to
kahn
and
shevin
again,
really
it
was
not
too
clear
on
whether
yourself
you
have
decided
that
case
strongly
or
what
is
your
view
is.
that
is
not
too
important
but
in
that
case
did
we
not
hold
that
the
state
had
enacted
there
the
special
benefit
for
women
which
was
not
given
to,
it
is
for
widows,
not
given
to
widowers
because
--
and
this
is
the
language
of
the
opinion
it
was
reasonably
designed
to
further
a
state
policy
of
questioning
the
financial
impact
of
spousal
loss
on
the
sex
for
which
that
loss
imposes
a
disproportionately
heavy
burden.
now,
isn't
there
something
of
that
same
undertone
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
make,
what
is
the
difference
whether
it
is
small
or
large
on
a
constitutional
basis?
unknown
speaker
i
think
such
a
small
benefit
might
be
more
invidious
as
a
sex
stereotype
than
a
large
benefit,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
congress
cannot
legislate
on
the
basis
of
the
assumption
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases,
the
man
is
the
primary,
is
the
dominant
bread
winner
in
the
society?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
fact
statistically?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
ginsburg
can
i
ask
--
would
you
find
objection
of
all
on
equal
protection
or
due
process
grounds
an
application
of
support
test
across
the
board
to
both
men
and
women?
unknown
speaker
that
is
another
--
that
is
a
different
question,
but
you
would
not
--
if
congress
said,
“our
overall
aim
is
to
provide
for
need
and
we
are
going
to
have
a
simple
rule
to
serve
that
and
namely
a
support
test
and
we
are
going
to
apply
to
both
men
and
women.”
you
would
not
find
that
objected?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
--
suppose
you
win
the
case
what
kind
of
a
judgment
should
the
court
enter?
just
the
declaration
that
the…
unknown
speaker
which
is
just
the
declaration
that
the
distinction
is
unconstitutional
on
equal
protection
grounds?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
any
reliable
figures
on
that
mrs.
ginsburg?
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
that
be
likely
a
fluctuating
group?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
that
is
why
they
have
revised
their
figures
downward
from
a
billion
dollars
to
four
hundred
and
some
million?
unknown
speaker
do
you
do
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
half
a
dozen
cases…
unknown
speaker
half
a
dozen
cases
have
been
decided
where
the
court
has
done
almost
precisely
what
you
are
suggesting
and
making
recommendations
about
legislature.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
what
do
you
think
your
primary
--
what
are
your
points
anyway,
earlier
in
your
argument
was
that,
merely
in
the
fact
that
they
are
paying
widows
something
you
are
not
paying
widowers,
did
not
prove
unconstitutionality.
you
just
said
accessed
over…
unknown
speaker
...overinclusiveness…
unknown
speaker
is
that
congress’
aim
as
to
pay
this
to
take
care
of
needy
people?
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
worth
30%
instead
of
2%?
would
you
say
that
degree
of
overinclusiveness
is
not
a
matter?
