john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones
i
am
also
a
little
rusty
on
the
case.
this
$440
million
figure
which
applies
to
the
small
narrow
class,
is
that
based
anything
on
the
record
or
is
that
something
you
have
developed
subsequently
just
in
the
briefs
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
not
be
correct
that
the
decision
not
to
require
a
support
test
in
the
converse
situation
is
just
justified
by
administrative
convenience?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
are
the
others?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
not
your
argument
suggest
that
there
is
not
necessarily
a
correlation
between
the
ability
to
pass
the
support
test
and
probable
need
at
the
time
of
the
applicant
applies
for
benefits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
have
thought
for
support
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
interrupt
you
just
to
be
sure
to
understand
your
position
in
response
to
justice
stewart,
is
it
your
view
that
there
is
no
discrimination
against
males?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
if
there
is
such
a
discrimination
is
it
to
be
tested
by
the
same
or
by
a
different
standard
from
discrimination
against
female?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
a
yes
or
a
no
answer?
i
just
do
not
understand
you
and
are
you
trying
to
avoid
the
question
or...
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
hear
a
case
this
morning
just
to
be
pre-involving
a
law
that
would
not
permit
males
to
make
certain
purchases
that
females
could
make.
it
was
attacked
as
a
discrimination
against
male.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is
whether
we
should
examine
that
law
under
a
same
or
a
different
standard
when
if
it
were
a
discrimination
against
the
other
sex?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
answer
always
depends
on
their
finding
some
discrimination
against
females,
you
seem
put
that
in
every
answer
to
this
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
there
were
one
you
would
say
it
should
be
tested
under
a
different
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
your
case
depends
then
on
our
analyzing
this
case
as
a
discrimination
against
female?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jones,
do
you
think
that
constitutionality
of
this
statute
turns
on
the
statistic
says
they
existed
in
1939,
1950
or
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
change
the
question
a
little
bit.
supposing
we
were
convinced
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
in
1950
and
that
conditions
have
totally
changed,
whenever
we
get
to
the
case,
would
we
be
bound
to
say
it
is
still
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
an
odd
role
which
you
are
recommending
to
this
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sorry
to
hear
that.
