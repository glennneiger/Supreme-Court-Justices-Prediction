mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
leon
goldfarb’s
case
concerns
a
differential
in
the
quality
of
social
insurance
accorded
men
and
women.
pursuant
to
the
federal
insurance
contributions
act,
payments
into
social
security's
old
age
and
survivors’
insurance
program
are
exacted
from
gainfully
employed
men
and
women
without
regard
to
the
sex
of
the
contributor,
whether
the
wage
earner
is
a
man
or
a
woman,
equal
earnings
require
equal
contributions.
in
contrast
to
the
gender
neutral
contribution
system
the
program
draws
a
sharp
line
between
the
sexes
amid
pay
outside.
benefits
to
a
spouse
available
under
a
male
wage
earner’s
account
are
not
equally
available
under
a
female
wage
earner’s
account.
the
court
below
ruled
that
this
separate
and
unequal
payout
system
discriminates
invidiously
against
the
wage
earning
woman
and
her
spouse.
that
decision
and
all
other,
five
other,
the
federal
court
judgments
on
the
same
point.
solidly
anchored
to
this
court’s
1973
judgment
in
frontiero
v.
richardson
and
1975
decision
in
weinberger
v.
wiesenfeld.
thus
the
issue
on
which
this
appeal
turns
is
cleanly
posed,
do
frontiero
and
wiesenfeld
impart
principled
cses
for
deciding
gender
discrimination
cases
formed
from
the
same
mould
or
all
the
frontiero
and
wiesenfeld
precedence
shallow
and
evanescent
as
the
secretary
would
have
it
today.
in
wiesenfeld
the
court
declared
unconstitutional,
the
social
security
act's
provision
of
a
mother’s
benefit,
but
no
father’s
benefit.
when
wiesenfeld
was
presented
to
this
court,
the
solicitor
general
described
the
gender
differential
varied
issue
as
very
closely
analogous
to
the
one
at
par,
and
in
frontiero
the
court
held
unconstitutional
a
military
fringe
benefit
arrangement
displaying
a
gender
line,
virtually
identical
to
the
one
at
par.
in
defending
the
frontiero
classification,
the
solicitor
general
noted
similar
distinctions
are
found
in
other
federal
laws.
he
supplied
as
a
sole
example,
42
u.
s.
c.
section
402
the
very
social
security
provision
now
before
the
court.
like
stephen
wiesenfeld
and
sharron
and
joseph
frontiero,
leon
goldfarb
challenged
an
employment
related
benefit
scheme
that
attributes
to
the
male
wage
earner,
status,
dignity
and
importance
not
attributed
to
the
female
wage
earner.
as
the
secretary
recites
the
old
age
and
survivors’
insurance
at
issue,
took
shape
in
two
stages:
first,
in
1939,
congress
ordered
that
the
male
workers’
social
security
account
should
attract
benefits
for
his
spouse
without
regard
to
husband’s
and
wife’s
respective
contributions
to
family
income.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
the
lines
what
he
has
like
virtually,
every
gender
discrimination
is
a
two
edged
sword.
it
works
both
ways.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
most
anti-female
discrimination
was
dressed
up
as
discrimination
favoring
the
woman.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
point
is
that
the
discriminatory
line
almost
inevitably
hurts
women.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
argument
would
be
the
same
because
i
do
not
know
of
any
purely
anti-male
discrimination.
in
the
end,
the
women
are
the
ones
who
end
up
hurting.
i
should
point
out
that
in
1950,
when
congress
authorized
these
benefits
under
the
female
workers
account,
the
dependency
test
that
was
attached
was
very
stringent
dependency
test.
it
was
not
a
question
of
whether
the
woman…
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
there
is
discrimination
against
males.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
response
to
that
mr.
justice
stevens
is
that
almost
every
discrimination
that
operates
against
males
operates
against
females
as
well.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
am
not
trying
to
avoid
the
question.
i
am
trying
to
clarify
the
position
that
i
do
not
know
of
any
line
that
does
not
work
as
a
two
edged
sword
as
we
heard
both...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
in
part
because
such
a
law
has
an
insidious
impact
against
females.
it
stands
then
docile
compliance
and
safe
to
be
trusted.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
answer
was
that
i
have
not
yet
come
across
the
statute.
it
does
not
have
that
effect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
there
were
such
a
statute,
i
would
reserve
judgment
on
what
the
standards
should
be.
in
any
case
i
have
not
come
across
such
a
statute
in
my…
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
my
case
depends
on
your
recognition
that
using
gender
as
a
classification
resorting
to
that
classification
is
highly
questionable
and
should
be
closely
reviewed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
as
far
as
i
have
seen.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
is
the
ultimate
effect
of
such
line
drawing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
kahn
against
shevin,
that
the
court
analyzes
that
classification
as
helpful
to
some
women
harmful
to
none.
if
you
accept
that
analysis
well
then
you
might
rationalize
that
as
a
compensatory
classification
that
could
survive
constitutional
review,
in
addition,
it
was
a
very
small
matter
involved
in
kahn
v.
shevin.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
classification
that
is
harmful
for
women.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
think
that
was
a
clear
indication
of
the
mathews
against
lucas
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sex
and
let
me
say
that
has
been
a
very
recent
development
because
as
we
know
at
the
time
these
lines
came
into
social
security
in
1939
and
1950
virtually,
anything
goes
within
the
state
of
equal
protection
law
with
respect
to
gender
classification.
but
anything
always
is
certainly
not
the
law
as
to
gender
classification
today.
equal
protection
principle
is
part
of
our
constitution,
intended
to
govern
american
society
as
it
evolves
overtime
and
inevitably,
keeping
pace
with
the
nation’s
progress
toward
maturity,
notions
of
what
constitutes
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
do
change
and
as
to
sex
discrimination,
they
have
changed.
thus
the
gender
line
in
question
here
is
no
more
secure
because
it
solidified
in
1950
than
it
would
be
if
a
program
had
taken
shape
in
1970.
the
court
has
not
yet
acknowledged
sex
as
a
suspect
criterion,
but
it
has
plainly
identified
the
vice
of
legislative
resort
to
gender
pigeonholing.
last
term,
in
mathews
v.
lucas
mr.
justice
blackmun
writing
for
the
court
referred
to
the
severity
and
pervasiveness
of
the
historic,
legal
and
political
discrimination
against
women,
discrimination
made
ever
so
easy
because
sex
like
race.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mathews
v.
lucas
did
not
involve
a
sex
classification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
the
process
of
so
doing
distinguished
sex
classifications
and
race
classifications,
both
of
which
present,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
said
an
obvious
badge.
yet
women’s
history
has
been
a
history
of
purposeful,
unequal
treatment.
women
have
been
subjected
to
unique
disabilities
based
on
stereotype
characteristics,
not
truly
indicative
of
their
abilities.
further
in
mathews
v.
lucas,
the
court
pointed
to
the
generalization
harmful
to
women
underlining
this
one
way
three
to
one
support
test.
the
woman
spouse
does
not
qualify
unless
the
woman
supplied
all
of
her
own
support
plus
half
of
his
at
the
75%
as
support
test,
at
issue
here,
it
is
not
enough
that
she
earns
51%
of
the
family’s
income,
but
the
court
pointed
out
in
mathews
v.
lucas
that
such
a
gender
specific
classification
reflects
the
familiar
over
broad
stereotypical
assumption
that
earnings
of
men
are
vital
to
the
family
and
earnings
of
women
are
not,
but
the
secretary
has
told
you
that
this
discrimination
in
the
old
age
and
survivors’
insurance
is
discrimination
helpful
to
women
discrimination
rationally
responsive
to
the
low
economic
status
of
many
wives
and
widows?
yes,
congress
did
attend
to
the
man’s
wife
in
1939
in
the
same
paternalistic
spirit
it
attended
to
his
children.
but
the
warranted
congressional
attention
to
wives
and
widows
is
expressed
in
his
scheme
that
heaps
further
disadvantage
on
the
gainfully
employed
woman.
a
law
that
benefits
a
woman
as
wife
or
widow
but
does
not
denigrate
woman
as
wager
and
that
might
be
rationalized
as
benign
and
the
gender
criteria
in
ranks
as
an
appropriate
means
to
a
legitimate
end.
but
the
section
402
differential
can
not
be
rationalized
as
favorable
to
some
women,
harmful
to
none.
the
wage
earning
woman
is
disfavored,
her
worked
is
devalued,
when
the
earnings
dollar
she
contributes
to
social
security
is
worth
lifetime
protection
for
her
family
than
the
earnings
dollar
of
an
identically
situated
male
worker.
in
sum,
the
line
congress
drew
with
section
402
does
not
ameliorate
gender
discrimination,
it
does
not
alter
conditions
that
relegate
women
to
an
inferior
place
in
political
and
economic
endeavor,
rather
the
gender
line
drawn
in
the
old
days
and
survivors’
insurance
program
reflects
and
reinforces
constraining
stereotypes.
the
differential
favors
and
rewards
men’s
employment
more
than
women’s.
it
casts
the
law's
weight
on
the
side
of
arrangements
in
which
man’s
work
comes
first,
woman’s
second,
together
with
other
incentives.
it
helps
steer
the
married
couple
in
one
direction
and
discourages
independent
choice
by
the
pair.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
critical
difference
is
that
in
kahn
that
small
tax
break
was
unlikely
to
reinforce
significantly.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question,
the
critical
issue
is
whether
the
distinction
reinforces
stereotype
characterizations
of
the
way
women
or
men
are
or
whether
such
align
influences
men
and
women’s...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
unlikely
to
affect
the
decisions
of
men
and
women
concerning
the
work
that
they
do
a,
$15
annual
tax
benefit
is
not
likely
to
have
such
an
impact
but
it
is
also
security
differential
if
it
is
a
question
of
which
one
will
be
the
dominant
bread
winner
and
if
it
is
a
question
of
thousands
of
dollars
that
can
sway
decisions
one
way
or
another,
$15
tax
break
is
not
likely
to
have
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
congress
can
use
a
gender
neutral
standard
but
it
cannot
simply
assume
that
the
men
are
the
bread
winners
and
that
the
women
are
the
dependents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
fact
statistically
as
to
this
three
to
one
dependency
test
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
millions
of
american
women
could
not
meet
such
a
test.
it
is
not
a
small
group
of
women
involved
here.
the
secretary
has
noted
that
the
median
average
computation
of
the
wife’s
family
income
is
27%,
when
she
works
fulltime
it
is
38%
but
even
27%
is
too
high
to
qualify
her
under
this
three
to
one
dependency
test.
so,
most
women
could
not
meet
that
test.
secretary’s
ultimate...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that
is
the
line
congress
chose
to
draw
there
would
be
no
problem
with
such
a
line.
the
question
whether
the
legislature
should
do
it…
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
would
not
be
a
constitutional
infirmity
with
that
line.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
secretary’s
position
here
is
that
--
although
this
is
not
clearly
stated
as
justification
for
discrimination,
it
is
cheaper
to
adhere
to
this
gender
criterion,
but
that
is
not
necessarily
true
nor
is
it
material
to
this
court’s
function.
it
should
be
underscored
that
the
remedial
issue
in
this
case
calls
for
tentative
adjudication,
not
final
resolution
by
this
court,
authority
and
responsibility
for
the
punitive
disposition
remain
with
congress.
striking
the
gender
criterion
leads
to
the
legislature,
the
full
range
of
gender
neutral
options,
congress
may
extend
benefits,
it
may
retract
them,
it
may
apply
across
the
board
that
have
support
test
or
a
less
blunt
limitation.
this
court’s
interim
disposition
should
be
guided
by
the
preference,
congress
has
consistently
indicated
when
a
gender
line
infects
a
benefit
program.
the
reshaping
has
taken
the
same
form
on
each
occasion,
removal
of
the
gender
based
differential
by
dropping
the
dependency
test.
that
is
the
course
unexceptionally
recommended
in
every
official
report
recently
made
regarding
gender
lines
in
social
security
including
the
reports
so
extensively
quoted
in
the
secretary’s
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
affirm
the
decision
below
which
held
the
one
way
dependency
test
unconstitutional,
the
consequence
of
that
was
that
leon
goldfarb
qualified
for
benefits
and
is
presently
receiving
them.
an
application
of
across
the
board
dependency
test,
though
open
to
congress
is
unlikely
in
view
of
the
very
drastic
program
change
that
approach
would
effect.
it
would
remove
from
the
beneficiary
category,
not
a
small
percentage
of
wives
and
widows
as
the
secretary
asserted.
but
based
on
that
27%
figure
clearly,
millions
of
wives
and
widows
would
fail
that
three
to
one
dependency
test.
nor
has
the
secretary
supplied
a
shred
of
evidence
in
this
case
as
to
dollars
saved
by
presuming
the
wife’s
dependence
as
--
there
was
a
reference
to
a
lower
court
hearing
in
maryland
in
the
jablon
case
in
which
the
government
counsel
did
tender
a
guess
that
the
administrative
expense
could
run
as
high
as
a
billion
dollars,
but
in
a
subsequent
hearing,
government
counsel
stated
if
there
was
no
factual
basis
whatever
for
that
figure
or
any
other
figure.
in
short
there
is
no
factual
basis
in
this
record,
nor
in
the
record
of
any
other
case
for
comparison
of
administrative
dollars
saved
as
against
benefit
dollars
paid
out
to
wives
and
widows
who
would
be
ineligible
under
the
three
to
one
dependency
test.
the
congress
never
attempted
to
determine
whether
any
saving
would
be
effected
by
assuming
men
independent
and
women
dependent.
it
appears
that
what
congress
did
have
in
mind
in
1939
and
1950
was
not
so
much
administrative
convenience
as
the
notion
that
husband
whatever
his
actual
earnings
ought
to
be
ranked
the
family’s
dominant
bread
winner.
further,
as
even
the
secretary’s
brief
reveals
albeit
sotto
voce,
most
of
the
husbands
and
widowers
who
would
qualify
where
this
three
to
one
support
test
eliminated
are
not
their
family’s
principal
bread
winners.
rather,
on
the
basis
of
the
secretary’s
projections,
the
majority
of
these
men
earned
less
than
their
wives,
the
life’s
partner
of
these
men,
are
women
whose
earnings
ranged
from
over
50%
to
just
under
75%
of
the
family
income.
finally,
as
to
that
cost
computation,
the
computation
introduced
for
the
first
time
in
the
secretary’s
brief
to
this
court.
it
is
a
one
eye
illusive
estimate
that
both
exaggerates
and
obscures.
it
does
not
offset
against
new
secondary
beneficiaries
with
ever
increasing
extent
to
which
wives
and
widows
are
removed
from
that
category
because
they
qualify
as
primary
beneficiaries.
entitled
to
maximum
benefits
under
their
own
accounts,
does
not
take
account
of
the
probability
of
continued
movement
towards
the
announced
congressional
goal
of
universal
social
security
primary
coverage
for
all
gainfully
employed
persons.
it
does
not
place
the
estimates
in
context,
the
total
sum
of
secretary
conjunctions
amount
to
just
about
two
thirds
of
1%
of
annual
social
security
receipts.
in
1975
those
receipts
exceeded
$66.7
billion.
as
significantly
it
appears
to
hypothesize
the
condition
that
does
not
correspond
to
reality.
the
projections
suppose
that
every
newly
eligible
man
would
retire
forthwith
as
early
as
age
60
or
62
and
take
full
advantage
of
his
eligibility,
left
out
of
the
calculation
is
the
social
security
act’s
vitally
important
retirement
test.
most
individuals
do
not
retire
at
ages
60
to
64.
many
potential
social
security
recipients
worked
well
past
the
age
of
65.
leon
goldfarb
for
example
retired
when
he
was
approaching
67.
all
potential
social
security
beneficiaries
under
age
72
are
subject
to
the
ex-retirement
