but
i
suppose
there
are
some
widowers
who
are
needy,
but
who
cannot
pass
the
support
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
what
is
considerable
as
a
support
test,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
support
test
in
the
first
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes
to
weed
out
the
needy
which
implies
that
there
are
some
that
are
not
needy
or
you
would
not
have
to
weed
anybody
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
additional
question
was,
aren't
there
some
widowers
who
are
needy
even
though
they
can
not
pass
the
support
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
man
involved
in
this
case
ever
indicated
that
he
was
needy?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
case
here
be
any
different
if
he
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
about
the
consequences
if
he
was
not
dependent
upon
her
at
the
time
of
her
death.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
need
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
weel,
to
that
extent,
it
is
an
administrative
convenience
argument,
i
suppose.
