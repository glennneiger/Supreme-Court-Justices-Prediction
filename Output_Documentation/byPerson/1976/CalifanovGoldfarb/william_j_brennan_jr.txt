under
the
social
security
act,
survivors
benefits
based
on
the
earnings
of
a
deceased
husband
covered
by
the
act
are
payable
to
his
widow
regardless
of
dependency.
but
such
benefits
on
the
basis
of
a
deceased
wife
covered
by
the
act,
are
payable
to
our
widower
only
if
he
was
receiving
at
least
half
of
his
support
from
her.
in
this
case,
a
three-judge
district
court
held
that
the
different
treatment
of
men
and
women
so
mandated
constituted
invidious
discrimination
against
female
wage
earners
by
affording
them
less
protection
for
their
surviving
spouses
than
is
provided
to
male
employees.
that
judgment
is
affirmed.
our
affirmance
is
supported
by
two
opinions.
i
had
filed
one
in
which
justices
white,
marshall
and
powell
have
joined,
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
other,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
