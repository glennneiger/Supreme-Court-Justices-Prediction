justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jones,
it
is
been
a
while
that
i
have
read
these
briefs
in
this
case,
they
might
write
in
understanding
that
the
basic
pia
test
is
applicable
alike
to
males
and
females.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
only
this
additional
test
that
differentiates...
justice
potter
stewart
...between
men
and
women.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
if
he
were
--
if
the
genders
were
reversed
she
would
get
this
windfall,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
anytime
if
somebody
does
not
like
a
provision
of
the
law
he
calls
it
a
loophole,
this
is
a
provision
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
is
the
question
in
this
case,
isnâ€™t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
bader
may
i
interrupt
for
a
moment.
you
heard
about
what
is
your
--
what
our
friend
mr.
jones
had
to
say
preliminarily
about
whether
or
not
this
is
anti-female
discrimination
or
anti-male
discrimination,
and
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
it
can
be
cast
either
way
you
cast
it
as
anti-female
discrimination,
anti-female
wage
earner
discrimination
that
could
be
equally
cast
as
anti-male
beneficiary
discrimination,
but
in
any
event,
do
you
think
there
is
any
constitutional
difference?
let
us
say
the
statute
wherever
it
says
widow,
it
said
widower
and
vice
versa,
let
us
just
turn
the
coin
around
and
say
the
statute
was
the
other
way,
would
it
make
any
constitutional
difference?
would
you
have
just
as
strong
or
and
no
more
strong
or
any
constitutional
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
because
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
have
when
they
have
seen
anti-female
discrimination
have
relied
for
their
constitutional
decisions
upon
the
history
of
anti-female
discrimination,
there
has
been
so
such
history
of
anti
male
discrimination.
i
guess
as
a
matter
of
historic
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that,
but
should
the
courts
through
help
of
those
advocates
such
of
you
as
a
view
i
have
been
able
to
see
through
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
my
question
is
if
this
were
purely
an
anti-male
discrimination
and
let
us
assume
it
were,
would
you
have
a
stronger
constitutional
argument
in
your
view?
