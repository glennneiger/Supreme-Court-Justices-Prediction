mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
the
issue
concerns
the
imposition
of
a
support
test
on
widowers,
but
not
widows
as
a
condition
on
eligibility
for
social
cecurity
survivors’
benefits.
the
appellee
is
a
retired
federal
employee
and
a
widower.
following
the
death
of
his
wife
he
applied
for
social
security
widower’s
benefits,
under
his
deceased
wife’s
earnings
account.
that
is
he
sought
to
tack
social
security
retirements
benefits,
social
security
survivors’
benefits
on
to
his
existing
civil
service
pension.
if
appellee
had
been
a
private
employee
rather
than
a
civil
servant,
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
tack
benefits
in
this
way
even
without
regards
of
the
support
test
he
challenges
here.
reason
for
this
is
that
both
widows
and
widowers
to
be
eligible
for
survivors’
benefits
must
pass
what
may
for
convenience
be
called
the
pia
test.
pia
refers
to
the
primary
insurance
amount,
which
is
the
maximum
monthly
old
age
benefit
to
which
a
veteran
is
entitled
under
his
or
her
own
earnings
account.
only
a
survivor
whose
pia
is
less
than
that
of
the
deceased
spouse
is
entitled
to
a
survivors’
benefits
and
it
is
undisputed
that
if
appellee’s
lifetime
earnings
have
been
covered
by
social
security,
he
could
not
have
passed
this
test.
the
pia
test
bars
a
widower
from
tacking
a
smaller
survivors’
benefit
on
to
an
existing
social
security
old
age
benefit.
the
theory
behind
this
rule
is
that
social
security
benefits
are
not
vested
rights,
but
are
payable
on
the
basis
of
probable
need.
if
a
widower
is
already
receiving
old
age
benefits
in
access
of
the
survivors’
benefits
to
which
he
would
otherwise
be
entitled,
he
probably
is
not
needy.
but
the
pia
test
standing
alone
is
insufficient,
inadequate
to
weed
out
non-needy
federal
pensioners,
such
as
appellee.
it
is
inadequate
to
weed
out
this
category
of
non-needy
widowers.
to
achieve
this
end
of
weeding
out
such
widowers,
congress
has
imposed
a
second
test,
the
support
test
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
under
this
test
a
widower
must
prove
that
he
was
receiving
more
than
one
half
of
his
support
from
his
wife
at
the
time
of
her
death,
disability
or
retirement.
the
practical
effect
of
the
support
test
is
suggested
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
in
short,
if
the
support
test
were
eliminated,
approximately
$447
million
annually
would
be
required
to
be
distributed
to
non-needy
widowers
and
out
of
this
from
$300
million
to
$350
million
would
be
required
to
be
distributed
to
non-needy
pensioners
such
as
appellee.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct,
it
is
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
support
test
does
not
apply
to
women.
a
widow
age
60
year
older
who
passes
the
pia
test
is
entitled
to
survivors’
benefits
without
regard
to
support.
thats
is
a
woman,
similarly
situated
to
appellee
that
is
a
retired
female
civil
servant
whose
husband’s
lifetime
employment
had
been
covered
by
social
security,
would
be
entitled
to
survivors’
benefits
and
this
loophole
in
the
social
security
law
does
not
appear
ever
to
have
received
explicit
congressional
attention.
and
it
is
upon
the
existence
of
this
loophole
that
creates
different
treatment
for
this
small
narrow
class
of
men
and
women
upon
which
appellee’s
case
largely
depends.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
is
not
in
the
record
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
methodology
underlying
the
estimate
is
spelled
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
merits.
the
amount
involved
was
not
for
an
issue
in
the
district
courts
as
far
as
i
understanded
it.
the
appellee
could
not
pass
the
support
test,
he
had
not
in
fact
been
dependent
upon
his
wife
and
for
that
reason
he
was
denied
widower's
benefits.
he
then
brought
this
suit
in
district
court
and
the
district
court
declared
the
support
test
as
to
widowers
unconstitutional.
relying
in
large
part
upon
this
court’s
opinions
in
wiesenfeld
that
is
weinberger
against
wiesenfeld
and
frontiero
against
richardson.
before
turning
to
a
discussion
of
those
two
cases
which
underpin
the
appellee’s
arguments
here,
i
would
like
to
make
some
general
observations
about
the
appellee’s
arguments
on
the
merits.
although
appellee
is
a
man
and
it
is
the
denial
of
benefits
to
himself
that
he
complains
of,
he
has
sought
to
portray
the
statutory
classification
as
discriminating
principally
against
women.
he
contends
that
the
real
discrimination
here
is
against
the
deceased
working
wives
whose
widowers
must
now
prove
support.
that
is
largely
against
the
deceased
working
wives
of
civil
servants.
of
course,
as
an
analytical
matter
the
discrimination
if
any,
bears
equally
upon
these
widowers
and
their
deceased
working
wives.
these
two
categories,
one
male
and
one
female,
necessarily
are
present
here
in
a
one
to
one
ratio.
that
suggests
that
this
case
does
not
involve
sex
discrimination
at
all,
but
rather
discrimination,
if
any,
against
certain
kinds
of
families
that
is
appellee’s
kind
of
family.
but
putting
that
aside
at
a
minimum,
all
other
things
being
equal,
the
choice
of
which
sex
to
characterize
is
the
disadvantage
class
here
would
appear
to
a
matter
of
purely
rhetorical
significance,
yet
all
other
things
are
not
equal.
there
is
no
legislative
motive
here
to
discriminate
against
women.
congress
plainly
designed
the
support
test,
simply
to
deny
benefits
to
non-needy
widowers,
such
as
appellee.
the
difference
in
treatment
is
aimed
at
men
not
at
women.
since
this
is
so
it
may
seem
all
the
more
puzzling,
why
the
appellee
has
worked
so
hard
to
characterize
the
support
test
as
discriminating
principally
against
women.
but
there
are
suspect
three
good
reasons
for
this
approach.
first,
appellee
is
attempting
to
obscure
the
fact
that
what
he
seeks
here
is
a
double
benefit
that
is
it
is
a
windfall
in
a
nature
of
social
security
survivors’
benefits
on
top
of
the
civil
service
pension.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
the
loophole.
widows
would
get
the
benefit.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
sometimes
they
call
it
unconstitutional.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
appellee
understandably
seeks
to
divert
the
court’s
attention
away
from
the
obvious
rationality
of
congress’
decision
to
deny
him
this
double
benefit.
in
that
purpose
i
would
like
to
frustrate
that
it
is
claimed
here
that
what
he
seeks
is
a
windfall.
it
is
true,
it
is
a
windfall
that
is
available
to
women
and
of
a
special
narrow
class,
but
that
does
not
mean
it
is
a
constitutional
matter.
it
should
also
be
made
available
to
him.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
the
second
reason
that
the
appellee
seeks
to
characterize
this
as
a
women’s
rights
case,
but
that
the
cause
of
women’s
is
now
a
fashionable
one
and
the
appellee
seeks
to
ride
on
its
skirt
tails,
but
it
is
the
responsibility
of
this
court
to
act
on
the
basis
of
what
reflects
a
proper
accommodation
of
the
respective
roles
of
congress
and
the
courts
and
not
to
act
on
the
basis
of
what
maybe
favored
by
the
shifting
tides
of
extra
judicial
legal
fashion.
but
the
third
reason
by
appellee
maybe
characterizing
this
as
a
women’s
rights
case
is
the
one
that
disturbs
me
the
most.
appellee
maybe
implicitly
suggesting,
that
the
rights
of
women
are
constitutionally
entitled
to
higher
protection
than
the
rights
of
men.
as
a
lawyer
and
as
a
member
of
the
class
that
would
thereby
be
disadvantaged
i
would
urge
this
court
to
reject
any
such
settled
suggestion.
women
constitute
a
majority
of
the
voting
age
population
in
this
country,
unlike
racial
minorities
for
example,
women
have
the
political
power,
if
they
choose
to
use
it
to
remedy
any
statutory
inequality
of
which
they
perceive
themselves
to
be
the
victims.
in
short,
women
are
not
a
discrete
insular
minority
that
requires
special
judicial
protection
against
an
indifferent
or
a
hostile
legislature.
this
is
not
to
say
that
women
have
not
been
subject
to
legal
and
social
discrimination
in
the
past.
that
history
of
discrimination
justifies
remedial
legislation
that
extends
to
women
certain
benefits
or
opportunities
that
may
not
be
made
available
on
the
same
basis
to
men.
this
court
so
held
in
kahn
against
shevin,
but
further
than
that,
the
courts
may
not
go.
men
and
women
are
entitled
to
the
same
stature
under
the
constitution.
the
ssame
constitutional
analysis
must
apply
whether
the
discrimination
of
which
appellee
complaints
is
directed
against
men
or
against
women.
with
these
preliminary
thoughts
in
mind,
i
would
now
turn
to
discussion
of
this
court’s
opinions
in
frontiero
and
wiesenfeld.
statutory
classification
at
issue
in
frontiero
was
conceitedly,
superficially
quite
similar
to
the
one
involved
here.
but
superficial
similarities
of
that
kind
are
largely
irrelevant
to
equal
protection
analysis.
at
the
heart
of
any
equal
protection
inquiry
is
whether
the
challenge
classification
is
rationally
related
to
a
permissible
and
a
substantial
legislative
objective.
in
frontiero
the
differential
treatment
accorded
men
and
women,
furthered
no
objective
other
than
mere
administrative
convenience.
the
government
so
conceited
and
this
court
so
held,
and
that
objective
the
court
held
was
insufficiently
substantial
that
justified
the
difference
in
treatment.
that
rationale
is
not
applicable
here.
the
statutory
classification
challenged
here
is
not
routed
in
mere
administrative
convenience.
instead,
as
i
will
show
momentarily,
the
classification
reflects
congress’
legitimate
efforts
rationally
to
allocate
source
that
scarce,
social
security’s
moneys
on
the
basis
of
the
probable
needs
of
competing
classes,
special
beneficiaries.
yes
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
is
justified
by
several
factors
and
administrative
convenience
is
one
of
them.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
is
not
rooted
in
the
administrative
convenience.
well,
the
rational
bases
or
the
social
welfare
considerations
on
which
the
government
relies
here
are
spelled
out
at
length
at
pages
15
to
36
of
our
main
brief.
but
i
can
summarize
them
here.
the
social
security
provisions
for
widows
and
widowers
have
a
separate
and
different
history.
in
1939,
congress
determined
to
pay
monthly
benefits
to
those
groups
of
survivors
whose
probable
need
was
the
greatest
and
it
identified
those
groups,
its
elderly
widows,
dependent
children
and
aged
dependent
parents
and
although
a
major
purpose
of
the
support
test,
excuse
me,
of
the
survivors’
benefits
was
to
replace
the
support
lost
by
a
dependant
upon
the
death
of
the
wage
earner.
congress
did
not
restrict
widow’s
benefits
to
those
women
who
were
in
fact
dependant
upon
their
husbands
and
the
reasons
for
this
mr.
justice
stevens
were
too
full.
first,
in
1939
and
for
many
years
thereafter,
very
few
aged
women
were
in
fact
economically
dependent
upon
their
husbands
and
to
impose
the
support
test,
would
have
placed
a
substantial
burden
upon
all
of
those
widows
and
upon
the
administrative
agency
as
well.
that
burden
would
have
been
incurred
to
weed
out
a
very
small
percentage
of
non-dependent
women.
the
appellee
here
conceits,
that
the
imposition
of
the
support
test
upon
widows
would
entail,
and
i
quote
from
pages
65
and
68
of
his
brief,
"an
exorbitant
administrative
burden,
a
potentially
monstrous
proportion".
that
is
the
appellee’s
language
that
is
not
our
language,
so
that
to
some
extent
mr.
justice
stevens,
you
are
correct
that
the
extension
of
benefits
to
women
does
have
some
basis
at
administrative
convenience,
but
at
the
same
time,
the
non-dependent
women
who
would
have
been
weeded
out
by
a
support
test,
are
very
likely
to
have
been
needy
in
any
event.
then
the
women
who
had
passed
the
support
test
that
is
the
women
who
receive
less
than
half
their
support
from
their
husbands
are
very
likely
to
have
been
either
deserted
or
to
have
been
living
in
other
circumstances
of
substantial
need.
very
few
aged
widows
were
truly
self
sufficient
and
it
was
both
reasonable
and
should
remain
for
congress
to
extend
widow's
benefits
to
these
women
without
regard
to
dependency.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
certainly
true
as
to
widows
and
it
was
truer
perhaps,
in
1939
than
it
is
today.
but
at
that
time
--
and
i
must
confess
that
these
statistics
are
very
rough,
but
at
that
time,
it
is
a
fair
inference
that
considerably
fewer
then
10%
of
all
women
would
have
passed
the
support
test
at
any
given
point
in
time.
not
only…
mr.
keith
a.
jones
would
have
thought
for
support
test,
that
is
correct.
they
would
have
been
non
dependent,
that
is
correct.
at
any
given
point
in
time,
at
any
point
during
their
employment
history.
as
to
women
age
55
and
older,
there
was
a
decrease
in
their
participation
in
the
job
market.
so
that,
it
would
be
considerably
less
than
10%
for
this
age
group,
but
not
only
that,
these
are
women
who
probably
did
not
work
over
the
full
course
of
their
working
lives,
who
may
have
worked
sporadically,
but
who
probably
did
not
build
up
substantial
social
earnings,
entitlements
or
other
retirement
benefits,
so
that
has
to
these
--
as
to
this
class
of
working
women,
it
is
a
fair
assumption
i
think
that
even
those
women
who
were
non
dependent
at
the
critical
point,
still
existed
in
circumstances
of
need.
now,
the
same
is
not
true
i
submit
generally
as
to
widowers.
a
program
of
widower’s
benefits
was
established
later
in
1950
and
at
that
time,
congress
reasonably
identifies
as
presumptively
needy
only
those
widowers
who
had
been
dependent
upon
their
wives
for
support.
with
few
exceptions,
non-dependent
men
either
had
substantial
social
security
entitlements
or
they
had
been
gainfully
employed
in
positions
outside
the
social
security
systems
like
the
appellee,
and
they
therefore,
fell
outside
the
category
of
probable
need.
the
support
test
served
to
weed
out
approximately
97%
of
all
widowers,
whereas
they
would
have
only
weeded
out
less
than
10%
of
widows,
and
if
the
support
test
had
not
been
imposed
from
75
to
90%
of
the
additional
moneys,
that
would
have
been
required
to
be
paid
out,
would
have
been
paid
to
non-needy
pensioners
such
as
the
appellee,
and
congress
rationally
chose
not
to
spend
its
scarce
social
security
moneys
in
that
manner.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
depends
upon
what
you
mean
by
needy
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
may…
mr.
keith
a.
jones
to
weed
out
the
non
needy
basically.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
--
well,
it
implies
that
some
are
not
--
excuse
me,
i
misunderstand
you,
implies
that
some
widowers
are
not
needy…
mr.
keith
a.
jones
again,
mr.
justice
white,
i
say
that
that
may
well
depend
upon
the
standard
of
neediness
that
you
use
in
a
welfare
system.
it
is
certainly
hypothetically
possible
that
there
are
some
men
who
were
self
supporting,
who
nevertheless
were
needy.
now,
there
are
of
course,
supplementary
programs
which
are
designed
to
alleviate
the
need
of
those
people
whose
need
has
not
been
entirely
met
by
the
social
security
action.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
he
has
not,
it
was
our
understanding
that…
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
would
certainly
be
more
attractive
on
facts
for
the
other
side.
but
as
a
statistical
matter
mr.
justice
white,
85%
roughly
of
the
benefits
that
we
are
talking
about,
go
to
civil
service
pensioners.
they
are
plainly
not
needy
and
of
the
other
percentages
where
we
can
not
say
with
certainty
that
no
needy
person
would
thereby
be
given
benefits,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
a
rare
member
of
the
so-called
disadvantaged
class
here
who
in
fact
is
needy.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
the
time
in
which
it
is
measured
is
not
during
the
lifetime,
that
is
the
time
of
the
death,
retirement
or
disability
of
spouse.
at
the
time
of
the
spouse’s
death,
why
is
that
fact
relevant
to
his
present
state
of
need?
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
he
was
dependent
upon
his
wife
at
that
point
and
if
he
is
a
retired
widower,
then
it
is
unlikely
that
he
has
extrinsic
sources
of
support
and
the
retirement,
excuse
me,
the
survivors’
benefit
serves
to
replace
the
support
he
has
in
fact
lost.
we
may
say
that
he
is
presumed
needy
by
virtual
impact.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
said
to
be
a
non-equivalence
except
in
those
rare
instances
of
perhaps
not
so
rare,
but
in
those
instances
where
the
woman
has
substantial
independent
wealth
which
the
man
will
inherit
upon
her
death.
but,
other
than,
in
those
situations,
if
he
was
in
fact
dependent
upon
her
at
the
time
of
her
death,
it
is
very
probable
that
he
has
lost
support,
support
which
the
congress
has
deemed,
he
needs
to
have
replaced.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
then
he
is
ineligible
for
benefits.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
he
were
not
dependent
upon
her
at
the
time
of
her
death,
then
he
has
lost
little
in
the
way
of
support
and
can
be
presumed
to
be
continuing
on
whatever
sources
of
support
that
he
had
in
the
past.
now,
it
is
true
that
this
is
not
a
means
test;
it
does
not
definitively
distinguish
between
those
persons
acutely
in
need
and
those
who
are
not.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
any
support
test,
any
dependency
test
is
only
roughly
equivalent
to
need,
for
example,
in
mathews
against
lucas,
last
term,
this
court
upheld
a
statute
which
imposed
upon
illegitimate
children
a
dependency
test
or
support
test,
even
though
a
similar
test
was
not
imposed
upon
legitimate
children.
the
criterion
was
considered
substantially,
rationally
related
to
a
need
to
distinguish
between
those
who
would
need
additional
support
and
those
who
did
not
and
this
statute
serves
exactly
the
same
purpose.
now,
it
is
true
that
we
have
here,
as
we
did
in
lucas,
a
problem
of
overinclusiveness.
the
statute
provides
benefits
to
certain
women,
federal,
retired,
civil
servants
and
certainly
other
women
that
are
not
made
available,
benefits
are
not
made
available
to
similar
situated
men.
but
mere
overinclusiveness,
without
more,
does
not
render
a
statute
unconstitutional.
well,
let
me
backtrack
for
a
moment
to
make
a
few
comments
about
the
wiesenfeld
opinion
on
which
appellee
and
the
court
below
had
partially
relied.
the
wiesenfeld
opinion
must
be
conceded
contains
language
that
have
taken
a
face
value,
but
requires
a
widower
support
test
to
be
struck
down.
the
court
stated
that
“the
constitution
forbids
gender
based
differentiation
that
results
in
the
efforts
of
female
workers
producing
less
protection
for
their
families
and
as
produced
by
the
efforts
of
men.”
but
that
statement
can
not
be
lifted
bodily
and
applied
out
of
context.
in
the
first
place,
the
statement
was
made
with
regard
to
a
statute
that
the
court
found
have
no
rational
basis.
the
court’s
rationale
in
wiesenfeld
was
that
the
statutory
bar
against
father’s
benefits
was
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
purpose
providing
children
deprived
with
one
parent
with
the
opportunity
for
the
personal
attention
of
the
other.
neither
that
rationale,
nor
any
similar
rationale,
is
available
here.
the
support
test
for
widowers
is
fully
consistent,
i
submit
with
the
underlined
legislative
purpose
of
restricting
benefits
to
those
groups
that
may
largely
be
presumed
to
be
non-need,
excuse
me,
to
be
needy.
but
secondly,
if
the
statement
in
wiesenfeld
were
detached
from
its
factual
context,
it
would
amount
to
a
per
se
constitutional
rule,
that
is
what
appellee
suggest
that
it
is.
but
the
due
process
clause
affords
no
basis
for
such
a
rule,
such
a
flat
declaration
of
what
congress
may
not
do
in
the
social
security
act
would,
i
submit,
constitute
a
radical
and
unwise
departure
from
historical
principles
of
equal
protection
that
would
allow
no
way
to
be
given
to
governmental
interest
that
might
be
served
by
a
particular
gender
based
classification.
this
court
has
always
given
way
to
such
interest
in
equal
protection
cases
in
the
past
and
it
should
do
so
here.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
beneficiaries
with
which
we
are
largely
concerned
here
are
retired
civil
servants
who
receive
government
pensions
and
that
this
court
should
not
likely
require
a
largely
irrational
distribution
of
benefits
that
the
appellee
seeks.
now,
the
appellee’s
arguments
here
largely
depend
on
changing
employment
statistics.
his
reliance
is
upon
the
fact
that
today
very
much
unlike
1939
and
1950,
there
is
a
substantial
proportion
of
non-dependent
women
in
the
job
market,
perhaps
aside
has
20%
at
this
point
or
roughly
in
that
area.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
justice
stevens,
if
you
believe
that
this
statute
was
constitutional
when
first
enacted
and
that
recent
social
history
has
largely
eroded
the
factual
basis
on
which
the
classification
originally
depended,
i
would
think
that
the
appropriate
remedy
would
not
be
to
determine
in
the
first
instance
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
do
not
think
that
this
court
should
sit
as
a
committee
of
revision
on
the
social
security
act
in
the
first
instance.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
believe
that
recent
social
history
has
undercut
the
foundation
of
the
act
in
this
respect,
you
should
advice
congress
of
the
fact
that
changing
events
have
cast
serious
doubt
upon
the
continued
viability
of
this
distinction.
but
you
should
give
to
congress
the
opportunity
to
sort
out
this
very
complicated
matter
which
--
no
matter
how
this
court
would
dispose
off
it
--
would
result
in
an
irrational
and
unfair
allocation
of
social
security
moneys.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
that
to
give
due
deference
to
congress
which
has
a
primary
responsibility
of
sorting
out
the
difficult
questions
of
the
proper
allocations
social
security
moneys,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
hold
at
this
point
that
the
statute
remains
constitutional
but
advice
congress
that
if
current
social
trends
continue,
the
factual
basis
for
that
final
constitutionality
would
have
been
completely
eroded,
but
give
to
congress
some
opportunity
to
sort
this
matter
out.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
that
opinion
to
the
effect
would
sufficiently
apprise
congress
of
--
to
solve
this
matter.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
is
not
unlike
the
role
you
played
in
the
federal
election
commission
case.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
that
in
the
matter
such
as
this
where
to
affirm
the
decision
below,
would
require
an
irrational
allocation
of
benefits,
that
it
just
makes
plain
good
sense
to
give
congress
the
primary
opportunity
to
take
care
of,
what
seem
to
be
an
unfair...
mr.
keith
a.
jones
constitutional.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
more
women
are
now
in
the
job
market
than
in
1939
does
not,
at
this
point,
standing
alone,
necessitate
our
finding
of
unconstitutionality.
i
do
not
think
we
have
yet
reached
that
point,
my
submission
is
that…
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
quite
right,
i
stand
by
it…
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
appellee’s
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
what
was
once
overinclusiveness
as
to
5
to
10%
of
the
women
is
now
overinclusiveness
as
to
perhaps
20
or
25%
of
women.
it
may
well
be
that
--
and
i
would
submit
to
the
contrary,
but
it
may
well
be
that
if
the
court
concludes
that
that
kind
of
broad
overinclusiveness
is
of
doubtful
constitutionality
that
might
apprise
congress
of
that
fact,
that
my
submission
would
be
that
mere
overinclusiveness
without
more
does
not
render
the
statute
unconstitutional.
that
the
statute
need
not
be
mathematically
precise
as
to
the
categories
of
beneficiaries…
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
it
is
a
matter
of
degree,
if
it
were
100%,
then
obviously,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
sustain.
where
30%
stands
in
relation
to
that
other
than
being
about
30%
toward
100%,
i
am
not
sure
i
am
prepared
to
say
at
this
moment.
thank
you.
