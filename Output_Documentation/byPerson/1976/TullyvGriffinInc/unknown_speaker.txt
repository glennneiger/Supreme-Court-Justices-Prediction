unknown
speaker
when
you
say
you
sought
to
have
that
tax
collected,
you
sent
one
of
your
auditors,
did
you
not,
to
the
store
in
arlington?
unknown
speaker
what
would
new
york
have
done,
if
the
appellee
here,
griffin
had
simply
told
the
auditor
in
effect,
get
lost
and
not
filed
the
lawsuit
that
he
did?
unknown
speaker
no,
what
i
am
going
to
say
is
would
you
have
brought
an
action
in
the
new
york
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
would
griffin
have
had
an
opportunity
in
the
new
york
proceeding
to
litigate
its
claim
that
this
was
an
unconstitutional
exercise
of
advising
authority?
unknown
speaker
what
would
if
it
would
be
some
sort
of
a
long
arm
service?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
situation
on
your
view
of
the
case,
if
sales
were
made
final
and
the
purchaser
had
to
arrange
for
the
transportation?
unknown
speaker
and
for
all
practical
purposes
you
couldn’t
really
tax
those
transactions
as
a
practical
matter?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
meant
by
the
practical
matter.
could
you
really
do
anything
as
practical
matter
with
respect
to
all
these
individual
purchasers?
unknown
speaker
unless
they
employed
united
parcel
service
to
make
most
of
the
deliveries,
that
is
if
all
of
the
purchasers
went
to
united
parcel,
you
might
be
able
to
track
them
down
that
way?
unknown
speaker
almost
impossible...
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
in
some
places
you
admit
you
do
not
want
that
money?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
want
the
money
to
rot
there
and
brought
it
back
himself.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
admitted
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it’s
not
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
it’s
not
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zolezzi
you
assess
the
deficiency
of
$298,000,
i
think
it
was,
is
it
your
understanding
that
that
was
based
just
on
those
items
delivered
by
the
plaintiff
trucks
or
was
that
on
all
sales
to
new
york
residents,
but
you
used
the
percentage
and
if
you
manage
to--?
unknown
speaker
but
the
question
is
that
were
you
trying
to
get
the
figure
on
those
delivered
in
the
plaintiff’s
trucks
or
on
those
goods
sold
to
new
york
residents?
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
very
substantial
deliveries,
if
your
figure
is
anywhere
near
correct?
unknown
speaker
we
are
able
to
do
that
in
the
vermont
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
couldn’t
you
have
entered
into
the
vermont
proceeding
here
as
your
hearing?
unknown
speaker
and
you'll
lost
that
motion?
unknown
speaker
and
i
am
asking
if
you
could
not
have
defended
your
case
when
you
lost
the
motion
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
lose
here
then
what
you
going
to
do?
unknown
speaker
and
one
other
question,
you
have
not
mentioned
or
have
not
cited
miller
against
maryland,
miller
brothers
against
maryland
in
your
brief
somewhere
in
your
argument,
would
you
comment
on
it?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
to
do
it
now
or
if
you
really
want
to?
unknown
speaker
would
the
constitutional
issue
be
raised?
unknown
speaker
in
the
administrative
and
the...
unknown
speaker
does
your
opposition
agree
with
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
cost
to
put
up
the
kind
of
bond
that
your
rule
requires,
your
statute
requires,
worth
$298,000
of
taxes.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
it
would
top
collateral
of
at
least
$300,000,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
probably
more?
unknown
speaker
that
is
pretty
heavy
burden,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
cut
it
in
half,
it
is
still
a
$150,000,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
griffin
may
have
to
submit
to
an
audit
if
you
told
this?
unknown
speaker
would
he
have
to
open
up
all
of
his
books
to
new
york?
unknown
speaker
and
he
is,
the
thing
he
has
complained
about
is
that,
he
does
want
you
to
see
his
books?
unknown
speaker
so
the
relief
you
will
give
him
is
to
make
him
show
the
books?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
why
he
filed
the
case,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
relief
he
seeks?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
in
new
york,
he
can
get
such
relief
of
not
being
required
to
show
his
books?
unknown
speaker
and
he
get
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
oppose
it?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
oppose
it
on
the
same
ground?
unknown
speaker
but
whether
your
oppose
it
or
not,
does
not
mean
whether
the
new
york
court
will
grant
it.
unknown
speaker
but
going
back
to
this
burden
again,
on
the
face
of
it,
it
is
a
$300,000
bond
or
if
we
cut
it
in
half,
the
$150,000
bond
on
a
relatively
small
business
in
order
to
achieve
the
opportunity
to
assert
either
the
validity
of
the
tax
on
non
constitutional
grounds
or
the
validity
of
the
tax
on
constitutional
grounds.
now,
in
that
point,
do
you
have
any
burden?
unknown
speaker
what
others
would
be
available?
unknown
speaker
pay
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
absolutely,
all
this
is
for
the
privilege
of
litigating
a
businessman’s
tax
liability
in
another
state?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
injunctive
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
the
proceeding
that
judge
kaufman
and
two
other
new
york
judges
found
was
not
adequate
remedy?
unknown
speaker
for
purpose
of
1341?
unknown
speaker
in
arguing
unless
you
get
over
1140,
i
am
not
sure
in
this
prohibition
that
your
statement
that
the
other
remedy
should
be
exclusive
and
that
should
be
no
declaratory
judgment?
unknown
speaker
1140.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
have
an
under
arm
an
end
run
around
that
statute?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
is
a
great
comfort
to
the
taxpayer?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
so
far
precisely
the
same
as
this
expect
for
the
word
occasional,
is
that
the
distinction
you
are
doing?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
got
a
(inaudible)
but
are
you
claiming
that
this
taxpayers
should
collect
a
sale
tax
or
use
tax
on
goods
that
are
sold
at
its
store
and
carried
away
by
the
customer
himself.
unknown
speaker
then
what’s
the
significance
of
these
advertisements?
unknown
speaker
it
is
perfectly
alright.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
right
to
advertise
in
new
york
and
say
here
is
how
to
get
our
store.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
then
as
long
as
the
customer
carries
it
away
with
them,
you
are
not
attempting
to
collect?
unknown
speaker
did
you
suggest
a
while
ago
that
in
this
declaratory
judgment
action
available
in
the
state
courts
that
the
tax
people
withhold
their
hands,
pending
the
completion
of
that
action
or
not?
unknown
speaker
in
case
you
identify,
i
suppose
you
can
get
a
no
really
a
flat
rule
in
new
york
that
you
could
not
get
in
terms
of
pending...
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
zolezzi,
what
if
in
mr.
justice
white’s
words
the
tax
commission
had
decided
not
to
“hold
its
hands,”
it
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
before
it
could
ever
get
a
judgment
even
in
new
york
against
griffin,
did
it
not?
i
mean,
just
sending
an
auditor
up
to
arlington
was
not
the
same
thing
as
getting
an
enforceable
judgment?
unknown
speaker
you
decided
to
seize
his
trucks?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zolezzi,
i
am
somewhat
confused
at
this
point.
as
i
understand
that
you
not
trying
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
plaintiffs,
but
rather
you
are
trying
to
collect
something
like
a
penalty
because
they
failed
to
collect
the
tax
from
their
customers.
unknown
speaker
on
the
sales
that
they
do
not
make
delivery,
in
other
words,
the
customer
comes
in
and
takes
the
merchandise
back
to
new
york,
who
owes
what
kind
of
a
tax
to
new
york
on
those
sales?
unknown
speaker
after
regardless
of
whether
not
griffin
does
any
business
in
the
state
of
new
york,
is
it
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
for
wholly,
wholly
apart
from
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the…
unknown
speaker
and
you
are
trying
to
collect
it
from
griffin
any
part
of
that?
unknown
speaker
all
you
are
saying
is
griffin
was
supposed
to
collect
itself?
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure
about
that?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
gross
do
you
collect
from
new
york
residents
who
go
out
to
arlington
or
everywhere
else
and
buy
goods
and
bring
it
in
the
new
york?
unknown
speaker
anything
at
all?
unknown
speaker
for
a
man
i
would
say
it
addresses
that
paramus
similar
to
new
jersey?
unknown
speaker
well
i
am
capable
(inaudible)
would
be
new
york
court.
unknown
speaker
but
if
consolidated
edison
buys
a
big
generator
for
a
location
somewhere
in
new
york
state
from
other
state,
the
tax
commission
tries
to
collect
the
used
tax
from
it,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
consolidated
would
probably
end
up
paying,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
if
it
is
relevant
to
this
case,
but
if
an
arrangement
is
made
for
griffin
to
have
a
standby
or
recommended
delivery
services,
as
you
indicated
before,
they
could
completely
avoid
new
york
tax?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
is
a
matter
of
vermont
law;
that
the
title
passed
in
vermont
and
goods
were
paid
for
before
the
delivery
was
made,
would
you
still
contend
that
you
would
impose
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
paying
attention
where
the
title
passes,
that
is
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
as
matter
of
state
law
in
vermont
it
took
--
the
title
passed
upon
payment
for
the
merchandise
and
then
you
could
i
suppose
where
you
kind
of,
the
parties
could
be
and
make
a
transaction
one
in
which
title
passed
at
the
time
that
goods
were
paid
for?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
disregard
that,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
will
irreparable
injury
though
is
not
a
test
under
1341,
is
it
not,
you
have
to
have
that
to
get
any
injunction?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
incidentally,
do
you
think
the
district
court’s
findings
and
conclusions
of
law
in
your
favor
on
the
applicability
of
1341
can
stand
side-by-side
with
judge
kaufman’s
opinion
in
the
ammex
case.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you,
how
would
you
distinguish
one
from
another?
unknown
speaker
but
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
not
to
the
speedy
and
adequate,
are
not
they.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
have
a
due
process
claim,
if
you
feel
there
is
a
constitutional
objection
to
new
york
procedure,
you
are
free
of
the
conclusion
of
the
new
york
court
proceeding
is
to
bring
that
claim
here,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
for
at
this
point?
is
it
your
understanding
that
new
york
is
seeking
to
collect
only
the
tax
due
on
goods
that
are
delivered
by
your
client
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
and
it
is
your
submission
i
think
that
there
would
be
eventually
that
new
york
is
constitutionally
forbidden
to
impose
a
sales
tax
at
the
point
of
delivery
and
make
the
delivered
or
collected?
unknown
speaker
you
think
it
has
to
be,
what
you
--
in
other
context
might
be
called
doing
business
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
would
you
not
concede
that
if
there
were
enough
trips
across
the
state
lines,
that
millions
of
people
cross
the
state
line
on
behalf
of
this
mom
&
pop
store
that
that
might
give
them
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
you
concede
that
how
is
the
state
of
new
york
ever
going
to
find
out
when
that
point
has
been
reached?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
are
litigating
with
you
now.
would
you
agree
that
if
they
asked
you
in
discovery
what
your
volume
of
deliveries
is,
you
would
have
to
tell
them
that?
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
tell
the
relevance
of
the
issue
without
having
some
idea
of
the
magnitude
of
the
transactions
within
new
york?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
have
to
disclose
that
in
the
federal
proceeding
anyway
what’s
the
irreparable
harm
about
submitting
to
an
audit?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
a
matter
of
the
burden
of
coming
through
a
lot
of
records?
unknown
speaker
that
there
is
no
privacy
at
interstate?
unknown
speaker
just
a
matter
of
responding
to
the
discovery
that
is
your
irreparable
injury
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you
are
just
reading
1341
virtually
out
of
the
books.
you
are
saying
that
any
time
a
federal
court
determines
that
the
imposition
of
tax
is
unconstitutional
substantively,
it
can
enjoin
the
enforcement?
unknown
speaker
or
even
when
there
is
a
claim
that
was
then
dismissed,
they
can
issue
an
injunction
depending
on
decision?
unknown
speaker
to
get
away
from
that
$218,000
because
that’s
all
over
rich
mom
and
pop,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
could
not
honor
your
mom
and
pop,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wickes,
suppose
you
were
located
in
troy
rather
an
arlington.
what
is
the
new
york
system?
do
you
have
to
file
an
annual
return
of
this
type
of
tax?
unknown
speaker
are
you
taking
the
position
that
under
no
circumstances
are
you
serving
to
new
york
tax
at
all?
unknown
speaker
not
on
these
deliveries
of
furniture
to
new
york...
unknown
speaker
well,
does
griffin
or
anybody
pay
vermont
sales
tax
along
what’s
delivered
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
in
vermont,
it
is
paid
by
the
vermont,
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
griffin
pays
neither
use
tax
nor
sales
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
griffin
setup
a
seal
where
neither
he
nor
the
purchaser
pays
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
of
now
the
people
in
albany
who
buy
the
property
in
vermont
and
is
delivered
in
the
griffin
trucks
in
albany,
nobody
pays
either
sales
tax
or
use
tax
on
that
delivered
furniture?
unknown
speaker
you
assume
that
they
pay
the
use
tax?
unknown
speaker
and
what
new
york
wants
is
double
tax,
is
that
he
say?
unknown
speaker
i
request
this
is
all
based
on
facts
on
new
york,
rest
of
the
people
complain.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wickes,
there
seems
to
be
a
difference
between
your
view
of
the
tax
and
your
opponent’s
view
at
the
tax.
he
told
me
that
the
tax
which
would
be
payable
on
the
merchandise
delivered
by
your
trucks
to
new
york
people
at
their
residence
is
would
be
a
sales
tax
and
you
are
saying
it
would
be,
the
only
tax
due
would
be
use
tax.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
issue
is
one
whether
it
is
a
matter
in
new
york
law
the
tax
payable
on
the
transactions
in
dispute
is
the
sales
tax
or
use
tax?
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
the
issue,
can
you
give
me
some
new
york
authorities
for
the
position
you
maintain?
unknown
speaker
the
seller
is
required
to
collect
the
tax
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
if
there
is
a
situation
where
the
seller
does
not
collect
the
tax,
there
is
a
use
tax,
it
is
in
fact
called
the
compensating
use
tax
is
to
make
up
for
this...
well,
if
they
get
to
the
if,
it
does
say
that
the
seller
must
collect
the
sales
tax
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
while
in
use
tax,
they
do
not
these
transactions
if
precisely
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
matter
of
new
york
law.
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
a
sales
tax
rather
than
a
use
tax.
unknown
speaker
so
you
were
mistaken
earlier,
that
you
said
it
was
a
use
tax.
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
what
they
are
trying
to
collect
is
a
sales
tax?
unknown
speaker
suppose
griffin
salesmen
brought
the
furniture
over
and
delivered
it
to
an
albany
home
and
said
this
is
worth
a
$125,
you
give
me
a
$125,
it
is
yours.
would
new
york
be
entitled
to
sales
tax?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
griffin
comes
over
and
says
mr.
jones,
i
want
to
make
a
sale
to
you,
i
want
to
sell
you
this
chair
for
$140
you
give
me
$140
and
it
is
yours.
new
york
is
entitled
to
sales
tax
from
griffin.
unknown
speaker
and
the
difference
is
what?
unknown
speaker
is
that
he
repaid
him
in
vermont?
unknown
speaker
though
that
they
receive?
unknown
speaker
if
the
property
and
everything
else
changes
hand
in
new
york,
i
think
new
york
has
an
interest.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
new
york
would
like
to
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
but
now
in
a
sense
that
is
where
ammex
and
the
district
court
here
conflict,
do
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
yet
he
and
the
other
two
judges
on
that
panel
were
new
york
judges
and
presumably
ex
new
york
practitioners
and
in
your
case
the
district
court
consisted
as
it
properly
should
have
about
three
vermont
practitioners
or
former
practitioners?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wickes,
first
national
city
bank
case
before
the
three-judge
court,
when
this
case
was
argued
and
decided?
unknown
speaker
the
first
national
city
bank
case
was
decided
late
in
1975
as
i
recall
and
as
you
suggest
it
is
very
clear
statement
that
the
word
exclusive
does
not
apply
where
you
have
constitutional
issues?
unknown
speaker
nevertheless
the
clear
statement
by
the
highest
court
of
new
york.
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
if
you
were
satisfied
that
declaratory
judgment
relief
followed
by
injunctive
relief
were
available
in
the
new
york
courts,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
you
would
present
that
issue
right
there,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
you
would
be
present
your
due
processes
you
right
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
may
lose
it,
but
you
would
certainly
present
it
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
you
think
that
they
would
say
that
you
done
a
good
general
appearance
and
you
are
now
under
the
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
but
whether
it
is
a
general
or
special
appearance
is
not
really
the
point.
the
point
is
when
whether
white
may
said
that
would
be
the
very
basis
of
your
complaint;
you
can
go
in
any
court
trying
that?
unknown
speaker
well
no,
have
there
been
any
instances
in
new
york
practice
where
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
has
issued
a
declaratory
judgment
holding
a
tax
not
applicable
and
the
state
tax
commission
is
nonetheless
gone
ahead
and
try
to
levy
it?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
are
distinguishing
between
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
and
as
i
understand
that
the
only
difference
between
those
remedies
is
that
one
if
that
the
defendant
violates
and
it
can
be
held
on
contempt
and
the
other
if
it
is
violated
he
cannot
be
held
on
contempt,
but
you
could
raise
every
issue
on
the
merits
in
the
declaratory
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
equally
true
if
you
lost
the
injunctive
action,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
distinguishing
between…?
unknown
speaker
that
maybe
so,
but
it
maybe
that
you
might
like
other
taxpayers
have
to
resort
to
your
administrative
remedies
if
you
want
to
have
the
amount
of
the
tax
reviewable
in
court.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
your
declaratory
judgment
action
and
you
are
afraid
about
what
is
happening
to
you
administratively
you
litigate
before
the
administrator
do?
unknown
speaker
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
showing
the
remedy
issue
that
explains
the
situation
so
far?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wickes,
may
we
come
back
a
minute
to
you
wanting
stop
the
clock
from
running.
suppose
a
three-judge
court
in
vermont
had
decided
the
constitutional
question
against
you,
would
you
have
gone
into
the
new
york
state
tax
commissioner
to
keep
the
clock
from
running
on
you
or
what
would
you
have
done
there?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
preliminary
injunction
had
not
been
issued
by
the
three-judge
court,
what
would
you
have
done?
unknown
speaker
could
you
have
gone
both
ways
simultaneously,
sought
injunction,
say
in
the
three-judge
court
and
peruse
administrative
remedies
in
new
york
just
to
protect
yourself
as
to
the
amount
of
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
if
you
could
have
done
it
in
vermont
because
you
have
done
it
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
very
substantial
dictum?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
negative
language?
unknown
speaker
what
issue;
i
thought
you
receded
from
what
i
thought
was
a
distinction
you
are
making
about
injunction
versus
declaratory
judgment.
is
your
point
that
even
though
you
could
get
a
declaratory
judgment
there
is
some
prospect
that
the
tax
commission
would
go
ahead
notwithstanding
the
state
court
saying
the
levy
was
unconstitutional
and
levy
on
the
property
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
reason
do
you
have
to
think
that
a
declaratory
judgment
and
it
will
not
come
up
on
the
motion
calendar
rather
than
on
a
trial
calendar?
what
reason
do
you
think
that
a
action
for
declaratory
judgment
will
not
be
heard
within
the
same
time
span
in
new
york
as
an
application
for
preliminary
injunction?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
either.
what
i
had
asked
you,
what
i
thought
was
an
ordinary
declaratory
judgment.
unknown
speaker
could
that
not
be
heard
by
a
new
york
court
within
the
same
time
span
as
an
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction?
