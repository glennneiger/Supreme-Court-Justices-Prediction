mr.
r.
paul
wickes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
section
1341
of
title
28
does
not
by
it
terms
require
a
dismissal
of
federal
court
complaint
that
involves
state
taxes.
rather
it
requires
the
district
court
to
make
inquiry
of
the
quality
of
the
remedies
that
are
available
to
the
particular
litigant
in
the
state
court
and
it
is
not
helpful
in
that
analysis
to
have
a
long
list
of
cases
which
uphold
the
efficacy
of
the
remedies
of
the
certain
state
without
testing
to
see
whether
they
are
relevant
to
the
particular
plaintiff
in
the
case
before
the
court.
the
appellants
assert
the
availability
of
two
remedies
for
griffin
in
this
case,
both
of
which
we
submit
do
not
pass
the
test
of
section
1341.
the
first
remedy
is
that
set
forth
by
the
statute
which
requires
as
a
first
step
that
all
of
the
books
and
records
of
griffin
incorporated
be
turned
over
to
the
taxing
authorities
of
the
state
new
york,
dating
back
to
1965
which
was
when
the
sales
tax
was
enacted.
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
the
united
states
steel
case
specifically
held
that
submitting
to
an
audit
by
a
taxing
authority
of
questionable
jurisdiction
constituted
the
irreparable
injury
and
if
that
audit
procedure
constituted
irreparable
injury
for
united
states
steel
company
and
the
other
corporations
that
were
involved
in
that
litigation
the
situation
is
certainly
much
worse
when
we
look
at
this
little
mom
and
pop
furniture
store
in
arlington,
vermont.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that’s
right.
i
think
in
the
district
court’s
analysis
in
the
united
states
steel
case
i
think
it
used
the
term
irreparable
injury
by
way
of
demonstrating
that
remedy
was
not
“plain,
speedy
and
efficient.”
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
but
i
certainly
reading
1341
literally,
you
would
have
to
make
out
all
the
ordinary
elements
of
an
injunction,
which
will
include
irreparable
injury
and
then
show
an
addition
that
it
was
no
“plain,
speedy
and
efficient.”
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
yes,
i
do.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
think
there
are
important
distinctions.
the
most
important
is
the
fact
that
the
appellate
tried
to
ignore
all
through
this
case
which
is
in
between
the
offices
of
the
new
york
state
tax
commission
and
griffin,
there
is
a
state
border
and
ammex
had
eight
sales
facilities
that
were
located
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
have
challenged
that
sales
tax
was
an
import-export
clause
challenging,
the
commerce
clause
challenging,
that
there
was
no
due
process
issue.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
think
it
goes.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
i
think
it
goes
to
the
quality
of
the
remedies
that’s
available
in
the
state
because
one
of
our
contentions
has
been
all
along
that
the
very
act
of
going
into
new
york
and
invoking
one
of
these
remedies,
may
constitute
a
submission
of
jurisdiction
in
new
york
which
is
the
basis
of
our
due
process
claim
and
if
that
is
correct,
by
the
act
could
going
in
and
raising
the
claim
in
new
york,
we
lose
it
and
ammex
clearly
did
not
have
this.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
that
is
right,
we
are.
there
is
another
difference
between
the
ammex
case
which
is
important
i
think
and
that
is
that
there
was
no
issue
in
that
case
of
about
whether
or
not
an
injunction
was
available
in
the
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
because
the
party
had
stipulated
that
there
would
be
no
collection
activities,
pending
completion
of
a
litigation
and
there
is
no
such
stipulation
here
and
judge
kaufman
thought
that
stipulation
was
important.
the
final
thing,
i
should
say
about
ammex
is
when
ammex
finally
got
into
the
supreme
court
in
new
york,
the
trial
court
in
new
york,
that
court
held
that
a
declaratory
judgment
remedy
was
improper
and
in
an
unreported
opinion,
this
published
in
the
new
york
law
journal
in
january,
the
court
said
we
are
not
going
to
decide
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
and
then
it
proceed
to
convert
it
into
an
article
78
proceeding
and
decided
in
ammex’s
favor
on
the
merits,
but
there
is
still
i
think
even
after
judge
kaufman’s
decision
in
ammex.
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference,
that
case
was
before
our
district
court
in
vermont.
that
was
argued
fully
in
the
district
court
and
i
think
the
district
court
deals
with
it
in
its
opinion.
the
second
objection
we
have
to
the
statutory
procedure
is
the
apparent
inability
of
the
tax
commission,
based
on
the
hospital
television
systems
case
to
hear
a
constitutional
challenge
to
its
authority.
apparently,
the
function
of
the
proceeding
in
the
tax
commission
is
simply
to
sit
and
check
the
arithmetic
of
the
tax
auditors.
now,
the
appellants
have
argued
that
we
can
go
in
and
present
evidence
on
the
constitutional
claim
before
the
tax
commission,
but
that
really
raised
a
question
of
what
is
going
on
here.
the
tax
commissioners
or
the
appellants
in
this
case,
they
have
argued
all
along
that
on
the
facts
of
the
cases
that
did
not
disclose,
we
are
liable
for
the
tax.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
yes.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
when
the
deliver
or
is
separated
by
state
law
and
has
the
limited
times
of
contact
across
that
state
law
and
that
are
presented
in
this
case.
we
think
that
expect
perhaps
for
the
map
in
the
newspaper,
this
case
on
its
fact
is
identical…
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
the
sales
tax
cases
of
this
court
have
set
up
a
pretty
clear
line
between
a
business,
on
the
one
hand
which
either
has
people
on
a
regular
basis
in
terms
of
salesmen
soliciting
orders
which
was
the
scripto
case
or
has
some
kind
of
property
or
facility
in
the
case
and
somebody
who
just
goes
in
and
out
on
a
temporary
basis
to
perform
a
delivery
the
way
that
they
did
miller’s,
there
is
a
firm
line
that
has
been
held
in
the
sales
tax
cases.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
think
that
at
some
point...
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
i
suppose
there
going
have
to
litigate
with
the
series
of
people
who
do
increasing
or
decreasing
number
of
trips.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
that
question
came
up
in
the
district
court
and
we
indicated
some
doubt
about
whether
we
would
agree
that
we
had
to
tell
them
that
because
i
do
not
think
under
miller
brothers
in
the
sales
tax
case
it
is
relevant,
but
the
relevance
of
the
issue
clearly
can
be
determined
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
can…
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
the
indication
in
the
district
court
is
that
that
is
how
they
decide
that
and
we
may
well
have
to
disclose
that
information.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
having
to
answer
in
interlocutory
that
asks
how
many
trips
you
do
into
new
york
or
even
how
many
dollars
of
business
you
do
in
new
york,
to
having
it
open
up
your
basement
where
your
records
are
kept
to
the
sales
tax
department
of
new
york.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
and
in
this
situation
it's
a
substantial
burden.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
not
a
very
important
matter.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well
no,
i
do
not
think
responding
to
discovery
would
constitute
the
irreparable
injury.
i
think
the
irreparable
injury
comes
about
when
by
asserting
a
tax
in
the
face
of
miller
brothers
or
in
a
situation
where
the
facts
are
as
close
to
miller
brothers
as
they
are,
the
auditors
can
require
us
to
turn
over
all
of
our
records.
i
think
that
is
the
injury.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
true.
i
think…
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
i
should
speak
about
the
preliminary
injunction
that
was
issued
in
this
case
for
a
minute
which
is
the
reason
we
were
here.
when
this
case
was
filed,
we
have
been
notified
that
an
auditor
was
going
to
come
and
we
filed
and
served
the
auditor
when
he
came
to
vermont.
in
the
initial
pleadings
in
this
case
there
was
no
request
for
preliminary
injunction.
we
requested
it
a
declaratory
judgment
and
a
permanent
injunction,
but
there
was
no
issue
about
preliminary
injunction.
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
after
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed,
after
the
state’s
memorandum
of
law
was
filed
in
connection
with
the
motion
to
dismiss,
came
this
assessment
for
$298,000
and
the
reason
we
then
asked
for
interlocutory
relief
was
that
on
the
expiration
of
90
days
from
the
issuance
of
that
assessment,
our
right
to
contest
the
amount
of
issue
was
forever
gone.
so
we
asked
for
the
interlocutory
injunction
just
to
stop
that
clock
for
money.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
it
is
a
quarterly
return
i
think
your
honor,
but
yes
it
is
a
self
reporting
mechanism
essentially.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
we
are
taking
a
position
that
under
the
present
circumstances
we’re
not
serving
to
the
new
york
sales
tax.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
right,
because
the
issue
is
not
whether
there
is
a
tax
due
on
that
transaction.
there
clearly
is
a
tax
due
on
that
transaction.
it
is
a
use
tax
that
the
new
york
purchaser
is
supposed
to
pay.
the
issue
is
whether
we
have
sufficient
contacts
in
new
york
that
new
york
can
constitutionally
require
us
to
put
on
their
tax
collectors
hat;
that
is
what
this
case
is
about,
not
whether
there
is
a
tax
due.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
there
is
no
sales
tax
paid
on
that
transaction.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
not
if
the
goods
are
delivered
into
new
york;
if
it
is
delivered
in
vermont
or
picked
up
in
new
york…
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
as
i
said,
griffin
--
the
store
never
pays
the
use
tax.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
not
under
the
statute.
under
the
statute,
the
purchaser
in
that
situation
is
required
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
do
not
--
there
is
not
anything
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
people
in
new
york
ignore
their
tax
statute
and
the
tax
is
due
on
that
transaction.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
assume
some
numbers.
even
i
assume
some
numbers
who
do
not.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
it
is
not,
it
is
not.
what
they
want
is
for
us
to
be
their
collectors
because
a
lot
of
their
people
apparently
they
think
do
not
pay
their
taxes.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
that
is
what
a
tax
assessment
was
based
on.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
exactly
the
dispute
here
on
the
merits.
that’s
the
dispute
because
if
the
sales
tax
we
have
to
collect
it
and
if
it
is
a
use
tax,
we
do
not
have
to
collect.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
that…
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
is,
you
see
that
the
way
the
new
york
sales
tax
works
is
that
on
every
transaction
where
the
sale
takes
place
in
new
york.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that’s
right.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
they
do,
if
new
york
can
kind
of
--
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
as
a
matter
of
new
york
state
law
there
is
no
question.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
right.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
i
am
sorry.
i
guess
i
am
not
being
clear.
it
is
a
sales
tax
that
we
view
is
the
case
because
it
is
a
use
tax
only
in
a
situation
where
for
one
reason
or
another
the
sales
tax
does
not
apply.
so
if
we
win
the
case
and
do
not
have
to
collect
the
sales
tax
then
what
new
york
collects
from
its
purchaser
is
use
tax.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
right.
that
is
what
they
are
trying
to
make
us
collect.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
new
york
would
be
entitled
to
the
use
tax.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
right.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
the
difference
is…
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
the
difference
under
miller
brothers
is
that
given
the
way
griffin
transacts
business.
it
does
not
have
enough
contact
in
new
york
to
allow
new
york
to
require
it
to
be
taxable,
to
fill
that
function.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
do
not
think
that
changes
the
situation.
i
do
not
think
the
question
where
the
money
changes
hand,
effects
the
situation.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
the
point
is
under
the
miller
brothers
and
the
bellas
hess
analysis
you
do
not
look
at
a
single
transaction
and
determine
what
tax
applies
in
that
transaction.
you
look
at
the
way
the
party
conducts
his
business
and
ask
the
question
of
whether
he
is
got
in
the
total
picture
of
enough
contact
in
that
state.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
yes
it
is,
yes
it
is.
now,
the
appellants
have
argued
that
we
got
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure
available
as
an
alternative
to
the
state’s
proceeding
and
they
cite
ten
cases
in
support
of
that
proposition.
on
careful
analysis
not
one
of
those
cases
can
safely
lead
us
to
conclude
that
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
will
be
available
on
this
case.
sections
1138
and
1140
of
the
new
york
state
sales
tax
law
are
extraordinarily
clear
in
saying
that
no
declaratory
judgment
challenge
is
available
for
any
kind
of
a
tax
litigation
whether
it
involves
constitutional
questions
or
not.
all,
but
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
appellants
in
support
of
their
declaratory
judgment
argument
were
decided
under
statutes
that
do
not
talk
about
forbidding
declaratory
judgment
challenges
in
constitutional
cases
and
the
courts
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
said
since
the
statute
does
not
forbid
it
for
constitutional
challenge,
you
can
use
a
declaratory
judgment
challenging
that
case.
two
of
the
cases
quoted,
including
the
one
that
is
decided
under
the
section
of
the
act
has
some
language
about
declaratory
judgment
actions,
but
on
the
facts
of
the
case
that
is
not
the
issue
involved.
there
is
the
hospital
television
system,
first
national
city
bank
case
and
three
of
the
cases
they
cited
in
support
of
this
declaratory
judgment
remedy,
while
the
court
talks
about
the
possibility
that
might
be
available
in
some
case,
in
fact
they
threw
the
plaintiff
back
and
sending
back
to
the
tax
commission.
it
is
impossible
to
read
the
declaratory
judgment
cases
in
new
york
and
find
a
rationale
that
can
lead
the
confidence
that
that
procedure
is
going
to
be
available
in
this
court.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
think
that
judge
kaufman’s
opinion
in
ammex
is
considerably
more
certain
about
the
availability
of
declaratory
judgment
than
it
should
have
been.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
right,
and
judge
oaks
is
one
of
them
who
sits
in
the
second
circuit
new
york
city,
but
that
is
right.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
do
not
remember
your
honor.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
right.
it
is
a
very
clear
statement,
but
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
decision
that
the
court
had
to
make
in
that
case.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
would
your
honor.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
because
of
the
fear
that
invoking
the
remedies
of
the
new
york
state
courts
may
cause
our
due
process
argument
which
is
an
argument
that
says
we
have
such
insubstantial
contacts
in
new
york
state
that
the
courts
of
that
state
do
not
have
jurisdiction
sufficient
to
support
a
judgment
on
the
taxpayers
and
i
think
we
will
not
walk
in
the
new
york
and
ask
them
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
we
may
will
cause
ourselves
some
problems
on
that.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
right
where?
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
yes.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
with
the
points,
i
think
we
cause
risk
to
that
issue
by
the
act
of
invoking
a
remedy,
it
is
the
problem.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
so
far
as
i
notice
there
is
no
special
appearance
proceeding
available
us.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
think
i
am
saying
that
i
think
there
is
a
risk
there,
a
risk
that
1341
does
not
require
us
to
take.
now,
another
problem
with
the
declaratory
injunction
proceeding
is
the
question
of
whether
an
injunction
is
available
if
the
tax
commission
decides
to
proceed,
if
when
we
begin
the
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
the
way
they
issue
their
assessment
here
after
we
went
into
the
federal
courts.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
our
problem
is
different
in
this
case.
our
problem
is
the
fact
that
when
that
assessment
is
issued
in
the
first
instance,
a
clock
starts
to
run
and
at
the
end
of
90
days
the
amount
of
the
assessment
is
fixed
and
forever
unchallengeable
and
if
we
go
in
and
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
new
york
and
they
start
that
clock
running
the
way
they
started
it
here
and
we
lose
our
declaratory
judgment
challenge
we
are
stuck
with
218
or
298
or
whatever
thousand
of
dollars.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
that
is
right.
the
risk
here
is
the
risk
of
what
happens
to
us
if
we
lose
the
declaratory
judgment
action,
that
is
it
is
eventually
determined
that
we
constitutionally
are
liable
for
the
tax
and
in
the
meantime
we
have
lost
the
ability
to
contest
the
amount
of
the
taxes
because
if
this
assessment
in
the
90-day
period.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
oh
yes.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
i
am
not.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
is
that
the
problem
with
the
asserted
remedy
in
new
york
is
that
if
the
tax
commission
starts
the
clock
running
there
is
not
anything
the
new
york
can
do
to
stop
the
clock.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
that
is
right,
but
the
point
is
that
if
we…
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
i
think
if
this
court
determines
that
these
remedies
in
new
york
are
"plain,
speedy
and
efficient"
then
that
is
the
situation
we
are
going
to
have.
if
it
determines
that
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
have
done
as
you
read
those
words
out
of
the
statute
because
the
statute
does
not
say
that
the
federal
courts
are
without
jurisdiction
whenever
there
is
any
remedy
available
in
the
statute,
it
clearly
imposes
some
test
about
the
quality
of
those
remedy.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
the
district
court
i
think
in
effect
treated
that
as
a
question
of
law.
there
was
no,
i
suppose
when
the
statute
is
written
it
is
our
burden
to
come
in
and
show
that
the
remedies
are
insufficient.
that
was
the
manner
in
which
this
thing
was
argued
out
in
the
district
court
though
it
seems
to
be
there
is
a
presumption
under
1341
and
under
the
cases
that
it
decided
under
it
that
just
in
terms
of
numbers
if
the
remedies
are
probably
adequate
and
it
is
up
to
us,
we
pleaded
in
the
complaint
that
1341
(inaudible)
because
the
remedies
were
not
adequate
and
i
think
the
burden
was
on
us
to
make
that
argument
in
the
district
court.
another
thing
i
think
is
important
to
say
that
in
order
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
it
is
not
necessary
to
make
any
expansion
of
the
categories
of
cases
that
are
permitted
to
be
heard
in
the
district
courts
under
1341.
in
spector
(inaudible)
and
in
the
township
of
hillsborough
case,
both
of
which
were
decided
in
the
1940’s,
this
court
held
that
in
situations
where
the
availability
of
appropriate
remedies
was
unclear,
it
was
proper
for
the
district
court
to
hear
the
case
and
in
the
couple
of
cases
that
were
decided
under
section
1342
which
is
the
companion
statute
to
1341
which
deals
with
administrative
raid
orders,
this
court
specifically
said
that
a
state
with
a
statute
that
denies
relief
when
that
statute
has
not
been
assertatively
over
turned
by
the
state
supreme
court
cannot
come
into
the
federal
court
and
speculate
that
it
may
not
be
followed
and
on
that
basis
try
to
get
the
case
dismissed
under
section
1341.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
if
our
compliant
had
been
dismissed?
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
well,
i
think
we
probably
would
have
to
go
into
new
york
with
all
the
risks
that
that
carries
and
try
to
stop
that
clock.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
am
not
sure
whether
we
could
have
done
or
not
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
if
any
reason
why
we
could
not,
it
turned
out
not
to
be
necessary
because
the
motion
for
the
preliminary
injunction
was
granted.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
in
the
new
york
state
courts.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no
because
i
think
the
new
york
law
that
prohibits
the
granting
of
injunctions
in
these
kinds
of
cases
is
so
clear.
there
is
not
one
case
that
suggested
that
statute
is
going
to
be.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
not
only
on
point
of
injunction
going
to
declaratory
judgment
there
is.
there
is
not
even
a
hint
of
dictum
about
injunctions,
not
in,
any
of
these
cases
there
is
not
even
a
suggestion
that
that
injunction
is
going
to
be
ignored.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
the
issue
has
not
been
raised
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
no,
no,
that
is
not
the
problem.
our
point
really
has
to
do
with
the
ability
of
the
new
york
courts
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction,
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
to
protect
our
right
eventually
if
we
have
to
contest
the
amount
of
the
taxes
that
are
due,
if
we
lose
on
the
merits.
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
declaratory
judgment
and
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
do
not
have
any
reason
to
think
that.
i
say
that
the
problem
is
that
a
preliminary
declaratory
judgment
is
not
going
to
tell
the
tax
commission
not
issue
this
assessment
they
way
they
did
in
this
case.
i
do
not
what
a
preliminary
declaratory
judgment
is.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
yeah.
mr.
r.
paul
wickes
i
doubt
that
we
could
fully
litigate
the
merits
of
the
case
in
the
same
time
as
you
can
heard
a
ordinary
preliminary
injunction
motion.
any
more
than
we
could
have
completed
this
litigation
in
the
district
court
faster
than
we
heard
the
preliminary
injunction
and
that
is
the
point
of
our
preliminary
injunction,
that
it
is
an
expedite
a
proceeding
and
we
do
not
have
to
make
a
full
determination,
we
talked
about
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
in
that
ultimate
results
and
that
is
what
unavailable
to
is
in
this
case
and
i
think
this
is
clearly
showed.
thank
you.
