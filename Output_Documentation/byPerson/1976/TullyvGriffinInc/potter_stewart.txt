justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
my
way
and
have
a
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
vermont.
the
question
is
whether
new
york
provides
a
plain
speedy
and
efficient
remedy
to
an
out
of
state
corporation
that
seeks
to
challenge
new
york's
assessment
of
sales
taxes
against
it.
a
three-judge
in
united
states
district
court
in
vermont
held
that
new
york
does
not
provide
such
a
remedy
and
accordingly,
it
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
the
collection
of
the
new
york
taxes.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
the
appellee,
griffin
incorporated
as
a
vermont
corporation
that
operates
a
furniture
store
in
arlington,
vermont,
six
miles
from
the
new
york-vermont
border,
it
advertises
on
radio
and
television
and
in
the
newspapers
that
serve
the
albany-schenectady-troy
area
of
new
york
and
it
makes
substantial
sales
t
its
place
of
business
to
customers
from
that
state
of
new
york.
it
regularly
delivers
furniture
to
the
new
york
buyers
in
its
own
trucks,
and
its
employees
also
enter
new
york
on
occasion
to
repair
furniture
it
has
sold.
the
new
york
department
of
taxation
and
finance
determined
that
griffin
was
"doing
business"
in
new
york
and
thus
was
required
to
collect
state
and
local
sales
taxes
from
its
new
york
customers.
the
department
sent
a
tax
examiner
to
vermont
to
audit
griffin's
records,
but
griffin
refused
its
consent.
instead
griffin
responded
by
filing
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
vermont,
alleging
generally
that
any
assessment,
levy,
or
collection
of
sales
taxes
against
it
would
violate
the
commerce
clause,
due
process,
clause
and
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
and
asking
for
injunctive
relief.
a
three-judge
court
was
subsequently
convened.
griffin
moved
in
the
federal
court
for
a
preliminary
injunction
to
prevent
steps
being
taken
to
collect
the
tax
and
to
stay
the
running
of
the
90-day
period
in
which
it
could
contest
the
amount
shown
in
the
notice
of
determination.
the
defendant,
new
york
tax
officials,
filed
a
cross-motion
to
dismiss
the
action
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
claiming
that
suit
was
barred
by
the
johnson
act.
the
johnson
act
provides
in
pertinent
part
as
follows.
"the
district
courts
shall
not
enjoin,
suspend
or
restrain
the
assessment,
levy
or
collection
of
any
tax
under
state
law
where
a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy
may
be
had
in
the
courts
of
such
state."
the
district
court
rejected
the
johnson
act
defense,
ruling
that
new
york
does
--
new
york
law
does
not
provide
griffin
"a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy."
for
the
reason
set
out
in
some
detail
and
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
have
concluded
that
the
district
court
was
mistaken
with
respect
to
the
adequacy
of
the
remedies
provided
by
the
law
of
new
york.
accordingly,
the
judgment
before
us
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
