mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justices,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
president
and
members
of
the
new
york
state
tax
commission
and
by
employees
of
the
new
york
state
department
of
taxation
and
finance.
it
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
in
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
with
the
district
of
vermont
which
denied
the
appellant’s
motion
to
dismiss
this
action
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
appellee
originally
had
come
before
the
district
court
in
order
to
enjoin
the
appellants
from
the
enforcement
and
the
execution
of
various
provisions
of
the
new
york
state
sales
tax
law.
since
they
sought
an
injunction,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
the
three-judge
court
decided
against
us.
that
is
why
we
are
here.
the
basic
facts
leading
up
to
the
action
are
that
the
appellee
is
a
vermont
corporation
with
its
place
of
business
in
arlington,
vermont
which
is
located
approximately
six
miles
from
the
new
york
border.
the
appellee
is
engaged
in
the
retail
sale
of
furniture
and
in
its
operations,
a
large
portion
of
the
sales
made
are
made
to
nonresidents
of
the
state
of
vermont
and
are
made
to
the
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york.
some
of
the
articles
in
the
store
purchased
by
new
york
residents
are
carried
away
by
the
residents.
other
articles
are
delivered
by
griffin
to
purchasers
in
new
york
by
use
of
griffin’s
own
trucks
by
their
own
employees.
these
employees
would
come
in
and
in
many
cases
setup
the
furniture
such
as
attaching
legs
to
tables
etcetera
and
they
will
also
send
repairmen
in
to
do
various
repairs
and
touch
up
work
on
the
furniture.
griffin
also
advertises
extensively
in
new
york
by
way
of
newspapers,
radio
and
tv
and
a
roadside
sign.
the
new
york
state
tax
commission,
based
on
the
activities
of
griffin
within
the
state,
were
of
the
opinion
that
there
was
minimal
contact
within
the
state
and
we
sought
to
have
griffin
collect
sales
tax
for
the
state
of
new
york
on
those
articles
which
are
delivered
into
the
state.
we
are
not
seeking
to
have
sales
tax
collected
on
any
articles
which
are
sold
to
new
york
residents
at
griffin
store
and
carried
away
by
the
resident
from
the
store.
we
are
only
after
the
tax
on
goods
delivered
into
new
york
state.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes
sir,
we
sent
one
of
our
auditors
to
the
store,
based
on
the
fact
that
we
felt
that
there
were
minimal
contacts
within
the
state.
when
we
arrived
at
the
store,
at
that
time,
we
were
represented
with
the
summons
and
complaint
in
federal
district
court.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
had
we
been
told
get
lost,
we
would
come
home
and
then
based
on
external
indices,
what
we
did
in
this
case
really,
we
went
to
the
vermont
tax
commission
and
we
obtained
figures
and
facts
relating
to
griffin
sales
and
those
sales
upon
which
it
had
not
paid
sales
tax
to
vermont.
we
took
a
percentage
of
that
and
applied
it
to
new
york,
basically
what
you
can
say
is
was
it
an
arbitrary
figure...
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes,
and
based
on
these
figures
that
we
obtained
from
vermont,
what
we
would
do,
is
come
back,
obtain
a
judgment
in
new
york,
and
then
under
the
provisions
of
article
25
of
the
new
york
state
tax
law,
we
would
have
gone
into
vermont
and
sought
to
enforce
our
new
york
claim
in
the
vermont
courts.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
when
we
went
into
seek
a
judgment
in
the
new
york
courts,
we
would
not
do
it
ex
parte.
we
would
have
to
serve
motion
papers
and
they
would
be
put
on
notice
that
such
an
action
was
pending
and
they
could
come
in
and
defend
thier
point.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
correct,
it
would
be
the
long
arm
service
under
section
302
of
our
civil
practice
law
and
rules
which
under
the
theory
of
doing
a
transaction
of
any
business
within
the
state
would
permit
us
to
have
jurisdiction
over
any
foreign
corporations.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
if
the
purchaser
arranged
for
the
transportation;
in
that
case
we
could
not
really
touch
griffin
because
griffin
would
be
out
of
state.
there
would
be
no
transactions
or
no
completion
of
the
sale
within
the
state
of
new
york
because
the
entire
operation
would
be
completed
in
vermont.
the
purchaser
would
have
his
own
vehicle
etcetera,
pick
up
the
goods
and
transport
them.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
as
a
practical
matter,
we
could
not
tax
griffin,
but
we
could
try
to
impose
the
use
tax
upon
the
purchaser
when
he
brings
them
in
for
use
within
state.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
practically
speaking,
the
answer
is,
no.
we
have
to
rely
upon
the
honesty
of
our
residents.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes
sir,
without
becoming
one
big
administrative
upon...
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
it
would
be
almost
possible.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
that
we
do
not
want
which
money?
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
oh,
no
we
are
not
saying
we
do
not
want
the
money.
we
are
saying;
we
are
not
trying
to
impose
upon
griffin
the
obligation
of
collecting
it.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes
we
admit
that
we
will
not
impose
griffin
when
the
purchaser
goes
to
vermont,
buys
the
article
and
takes
it
with
him
from
the
store.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
no,
that’s
not
in
this
case.
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
get
griffin
to
collect
the
sales
tax
for
those
goods
which
are
delivered
into
new
york
state
by
griffin’s
trucks,
by
griffin’s
employees.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
we
used
the
percentage.
what
we
had
done
was
as
i
mentioned
before,
going
to
the
vermont
tax
commission
and
obtained
an
amount
of
money
that
was
payable
in
sales
taxes
and
sales
taxes
that
were
not
paid
to
vermont.
we
took
griffin’s
sales
and
then
we
had
the
sales
upon
which
no
taxes
were
paid.
we
took
a
percentage
of
that
and
we
accessed
that
against
griffin.
this
was
done
under
section
1138
of
our
tax
law,
1138
(a).
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
we
are
trying
to
get
the
figure
on
the
goods
that
are
delivered
by
griffin
in
their
trucks
to
residents
of
new
york
in
new
york
state.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
we
are
of
the
opinion,
your
honor.
at
this
point
when
we
try
to
have
an
order,
they
would
not
permit
us
to
see
the
books
and
we
really
do
not
have
--
we
do
not
know
at
this
point
really
how
much
they
are
doing.
this
is
a
pure
estimate
and
this
is
one
reason
why
we
would
like
to
have
a
hearing,
so
that
we
could
determine,
if
they
are
liable,
if
they
have
minimum
contacts,
if
they
do
have
substantial
business
within
the
state.
if
they
do
have
substantial
business,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
they
should
render
and
collect
the
sales
tax
for
us.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
in
the
vermont
proceeding?
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes,
we
had
a
judgment
in
new
york
and
went
over
to
vermont.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
we
weren’t
in
the
vermont
proceeding.
we
were
in
the
federal
court
and
since
they
had
asked
for
injunction,
i
had
moved
in
federal
court
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
based
on
28
u.
s.
c.
1341
which
says
that
the
district
court
shall
not
enjoin,
suspend,
restrain
the
assessment,
levy
and
collection
of
taxes
in
state
law.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes
sir.
there
was
a
three-judge
court
that
sat
on
the
motion.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
it
is
possible,
but
we
preferred
to
come
in
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
because
we
feel
that
this
action
should
be
within
new
york
courts
because
we
feel
we
have...
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
if
we
lose
here,
i
imagine
we
are
just
going
to
have
to
go
into
federal
court
and
defend
our
action.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well
i
have…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
having
made
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
question
before
the
district
court
in
vermont
was
whether
the
state
of
new
york
can
provide
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedies.
unfortunately,
the
district
court
in
vermont
felt
that
the
state
of
new
york
cannot
provide
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedies
and
we
have
now
appealed
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
such
adequate
remedies
are
available.
griffin
would
have
two
remedies
available
to
it
in
the
state
of
new
york.
one
would
be
by
an
administrative
agency,
judicial
review
remedy.
now,
this
is
a
proceeding
under
article
78
of
our
civil
practice
law
and
rules.
the
second
method
or
relief
would
be
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
in
an
article
78?
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes
it
can.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
i
do
not
believe
he
does.
under
the
provisions
of
section
1138
of
the
new
york
state
tax
law,
it
specifically
provides
that
there
maybe
an
administrative
review
by
the
state
tax
commission
of
any
assessments,
determinations
of
the
state
department
of
taxation
and
finance.
if
the
state
tax
department,
state
tax
commission
has
this
review
the
appellee
would
come
before
the
commission,
present
all
those
facts
which
it
feels
which
supports
it
is
position.
the
state
tax
commission
then
would
review
the
evidence
as
it
was
presented
and
based
upon
that
evidence
it
would
render
a
determination.
if
the
determination
is
favorable
to
the
appellee,
it
would
conclude
the
entire
matter.
the
state
tax
commission
cannot
decide
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
the
appellee
is
claiming
as
being
unconstitutionally
applies
with,
but
it
can
decide
whether
a
statute
should
be
applied
to
a
particular
taxpayer
or
person
who
has
asked
for
a
hearing.
the
appellee
contends
an
article
78
proceeding
as
an
inadequate
remedy
because
in
order
to
review
the
decision
of
state
tax
commission,
he
would
have
to
commence
an
article
78
proceeding,
which
is
judicial
review
of
an
administrative
determination.
prior
to
bringing
an
article
78
proceeding,
they
would
either
have
to
pay
the
tax
or
post
the
bond
for
the
tax.
the
appellee
contends
that
this
would
render
it
not
a
speedy,
plain
or
an
efficient
remedy.
as
i
said
before,
the
appellee
is
pre
supposing
that
the
determination
of
state
tax
commission
would
be
adverse
to
it.
i
think
that
in
this
regard,
he
is
trying
to
make
the
state
tax
commission
a
rubber
stamp
of
the
department
of
taxation
and
finance,
it
is
not.
it
must
review
the
evidence
as
presented
and
its
decision
must
be
based
in
fact
upon
the
evidence
as
it
has
been
reviewed.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
your
honor,
i
honestly
do
not
know
what
a
bondsman
would
charge
percentage
to...
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
i
would
assume
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
once
again…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
once
again
we
are
at
a
position
where
while
the
tax
is
assessed
at
$298,000
that
is
a
high
estimate
by
the
department
of
taxation
and
finance.
if
we
had
an
audit
of
the
books
and
we
actually
saw
how
much
was
being
delivered
into
new
york
state
and
then
assess
our
particular
sales
tax
on
it,
that
amount,
that
dollar
amount
could
be
substantially
reduced,
that
that
$298,000
should
not
be
taken
as
a
figure
which
is
absolute
that
we
have
to
post
$298,000
bond.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
correct,
it
maybe
less
than
that,
we
do
not
know.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
if
he
went
before
a
hearing
before
the
tax
commission?
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
he
would
have
to
open
up
his
books
as
to
those
sales
which
are
delivered
into
new
york
state.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
we
are
not
going
to
give
him
the
reason,
make
him
show
his
books.
he
can
either
say…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
this
is
why
he
filed,
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
he
can
bring
an
action
for
the
declaratory
judgment
in
the
state
court’s
in
which
case
he
can
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
applicability
of
the
new
york
tax
statute
did
not
apply
to
him.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
he
can
get
an
injunction
under
section
6301
of
the
civil
practice
law
and
rules.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
that
is
a
policy
decision
of
the
state
tax
commission
that
i
cannot
make
at
this
point.
i
would
assume
that
we
would
put
up
nominal
opposition
to
it,
basically
because
we
would
like
to
get
griffin
into
court
to
find
out
how
much
he
owes
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
even
if
we
opposed
it,
the
likelihood
of
griffin
obtaining
an
adjunction
in
the
new
york
state
is
extremely
good
because
under
section
6301,
it
says
that
a
irreparable
harm
would
be
done
to
the
person
seeking
the
injunction,
the
courts
will
grant
an
injunction.
in
this
case,
with
a
$298,000
assessment
and
griffin
claiming
only
$250,000
in
the
assets,
i
am
sure
the
court
would
say,
if
we
do
not
grant
an
injunction
a
irreparable
harm
would
be
done
and
it
would.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
this
would
be
a
feature
of
the
article
78
procedure
approach.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
the
other
approach
would
be
available
to
him.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
if
he
paid
the
tax
and
came
into
court
and
his
position
was
sustained,
we
not
only
return
the
tax,
but
we
would
give
him
6%
interest
on
top
of
it.
we
do
not
take
tax.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
this
is
would
be
a
piece
of
the
article
78
approach.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
as
i
said
in
the
injunction
proceeding
which
would
be
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
as
is
provide
for
by
section
3001
of
our
civil
practice
law
and
rules.
the
appellee
could
come
into
the
courts
of
new
york,
apply
for
and
most
probably
obtain
an
injunction
because
a
irreparable
harm
would
be
done,
if
we
were
to
force
him
to
pay
more
than
his
total
assets.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
they
found
that
that
was
an
adequate
remedy.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes
in
the
ammex
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
under
1140.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
now,
under
the
provisions…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
it
is
not
an
end
run
around.
we
took
it
head
on
in
new
york.
under
the
declaratory
judgment
proceedings,
set
forth
by
section
3001
of
the
civil
practice
law
and
rules,
we
have
cases
in
new
york,
specifically
holding
that
eventhough
a
tax
statute
says
that
an
article
78
proceeding
shall
be
the
exclusive
remedy
to
be
followed.
if
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
or
the
applicability
of
the
statute
is
challenged,
you
do
not
have
to
follow
the
article
78
proceeding,
but
you
can
proceed
in
the
way
of
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
it
is
a
comfort
to
the
tax
department.
the
answer
is
yes
because
otherwise
what
will
happen
is
if
he
does
not
come
in
and
challenge
us,
eventually
what
will
happen
is
his
trucks
will
come
in
to
new
york
and
we
will
probably
confiscate
one
and
then
we
are
going
to
run
into
the
miller
situation,
is
probably
could
be
your
next
question,
we
are
the
opinion
that
miller
does
not
apply
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
miler
was
a
situation
where
the
state
of
maryland
was
trying
to
impose
the
collection
of
the
use
and
consumption
tax
of
the
state
of
maryland
upon
a
delaware
vendor.
under
that
case,
the
residents
of
maryland
would
go
into
delaware,
purchase
their
goods
and
they
would
bring
them
back
into
maryland
or
on
occasion
miller
would
have
its
trucks
deliver
the
goods
into
maryland
on
an
occasional
basis.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
there
is
substantial
business
interest
within
the
state.
we
feel
if
there
is
more
than
a
minimum
contact
that
miller
did
not
have
the
minimum
contact
as
such.
miller
did
its
advertising
strictly
in
its
delaware
papers.
the
advertising
happened
to
carry
over
into
maryland
and
maryland
residents
then
went
to
delaware
to
miller’s
store,
made
their
purchases
and
proceeded
from
there.
in
the
case
at
bar,
griffin
advertises
in
new
york
newspapers
which
are
published
solely
in
new
york.
in
its
advertisement
as
will
be
found
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
there
is
a
map
which
specifically
sets
forth
the
roads
to
be
taken
from
the
albany,
schenectady
and
cambridge
areas
of
new
york
to
griffin’s
store
in
vermont.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
no
sir,
no
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
we
say
that…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
it
is
perfectly
alright.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
right,
solicitation
itself
would
not
be
doing
business
within
the
state,
i
agree.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
we
are
not
attempting
to
collect
it.
however,
the
solicitation
within
the
state
coupled
with
the
delivery
by
griffin’s
employees
with
griffin’s
trucks
and
the
sending
of
griffin’s
repairmen
into
the
state
to
do
touch
up
work.
the
cumulative
effect
of
it
would
be
a
minimal
contact
of
doing
business
or
transacting
business
within
the
state.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
contract
itself
is
not
completed
until
the
goods
are
delivered
and
the
delivery
takes
place
in
the
state.
the
new
york
state
sales
tax
is
a
tax
which
is
placed
at
the
time
of
transfer
of
possession
or
title
and
as
this
court
held
in
the
berwind
white
case
back
in
1939
that
is
a
tax
which
can
be
upheld
because
the
tax
takes
place
at
transfer
of
possession
and/or
title.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
i
did
not
say
that
we
would
hold
our
hands
pending,
i
just
said
that
the
probability
of
success
on
griffin’s
part
was
greater
than
any
because
of
the
irreparable
harm
which
would
be
done
prior
to
the
hearing,
with
a
$298,000
tax
assessment
and
only
$250,000
in
assets.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
oh,
there
is
no
question.
there
is
no
flat
rule
saying
he
could
not
get
an
injunction.
he
could
get
an
injunction
and
probability
of
success
is
great.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
no,
we
would
send
the
auditor
to
arlington.
the
auditor
would
come
back
with
his
report.
based
upon
that,
we
would
commence
an
action
against
griffin
in
our
state
courts
for
the
enforcement
of
injunction.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
unless
we
decided
to
seize
his
trucks,
correct,
but
the
practicalities
of
that
are
few
and
far
between
because
we
just
do
not
have
the
manpower
to
sit
on
the
roads
from
vermont
to
new
york
waiting
for
griffin’s
trucks
to
come.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
no,
under
the
new
york
state
tax
law,
a
vendor
who
does
business
within
the
state
of
new
york
is
personally
liable
for
sales
tax.
the
sales
tax
is
collected
from
purchaser.
if
the
vendor
does
not
collect
the
sale
tax,
at
that
point
the
vendor
himself
would
become
liable
for
the
sales
tax
that
he
had
not
collected.
this
is…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
on
those
sales,
the
purchaser
himself,
upon
coming
back
would
owe
the
state
of
new
york
a
use
tax
for
use
within
the
state
of
new
york,
but
it
would
not…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
a
wholly
apart
from
that.
any
purchase
by
a
new
york
resident
out
of
state
and
brought
back
in,
the
purchaser
on
his
own
honesty
is
supposed
to
call
the
tax
department
and
say
i
owe
you
money.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
no,
we
are
not
trying
to
collect
that
at
all.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
no,
griffins
should
not
collect
that
tax.
this
is
where
we
differ
also
from
miller
because
maryland
when
tried
to
get
miller
to
collect
the
used
tax.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
i
am
pretty
sure
of
that
your
honor.
it
was
a
use
and
consumption
tax
that
maryland
was
trying
to
impose
in
miller.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
i
would
even
venture
a
guess,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
i
would
not
venture
a
guess.
i
honestly
do
not
know.
i
know
that
on
occasion…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
this
is
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
this
is
exactly
what
had
happened
in,
just
prior
to
this
griffin
case,
we
sent
people
out
and
they
had
road
blocks
for
the
truck
mileage
tax
as
an
incident
to
collection
of
the
truck
mileage
tax
by
new
york
state.
it
was
found
that
many
goods
were
been
shipped
into
the
state
of
new
york
and
no
sales
tax
was
being
collected.
the
sales
tax
in
new
york
is
the
tax
which
is
applicable
at
place
of
delivery.
so
even
within
the
new
york
stature
rates
vary.
you
can
buy
goods
in
new
york
city
which
has
an
8%
sales
tax,
order
them
shipped
to
schenectady
county
which
have
a
4%
sales
tax
and
you
only
have
to
pay
4%
sales
tax.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
buy
it
in
schenectady
county
to
ship
to
new
york,
you
pay
8%.
so
sales
tax
takes
place
on
delivery.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
we
try
to
collect
the
use
tax
from
consolidated
edison
and
not
from
the
vendor
who
sold
the
generator.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
correct.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
now,
if
griffin
arranged
for
either
mail
or
common
carrier
services
then
we
will
fall
directly
into
a
bellas
hess
type
of
situation
where
we
could
not
tax
them.
but
by
the
fact
that
they
are
using
their
own
trucks,
their
own
employees
and
they
are
sending
own
repairmen
into…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
yes
because
our
tax
takes
place
upon
delivery
and
if
they
can
obtain
a
credit
from
vermont
for
tax
that
they
pay
in
new
york,
fine,
but
as
far
as
new
york
is
concerned,
we
say
that
our...
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
i
believe
that
title
would
pass
upon
completion
of
delivery
and
the
completion
of
delivery
takes
place
in
new
york
state.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
well,
the
new
york
state
sales
tax…
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
the
state
sales
tax
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
berwind
white
case
is
the
tax
takes
place
upon
transfer
of
title
and/or
possession
and
possession
as
transferred
is
in
new
york
state
when
delivered
by
griffin
to
the
purchaser
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
thomas
p.
zolezzi
thank
you,
your
honors.
i
just
request
that
the
lower
court’s
decision
overturned
and
that
the
complaints
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
