justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
think
that
the
question
as
you
put
it,
you
could
mean
the
entire
act,
is
that
the
question,
or
is
it
legitimate
to
ask
whether
any
section
of
it
is
facially
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
do
have
to
reach
the
question
now
of
private
papers.
you
mentioned
only
public
papers
and
congressâ€™
power
over
public
papers.
now,
apparently
no
one
suggested
all
the
papers
that
have
been
seized
here
are
public
papers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let's
just
assume
that
as
this
court
read
this
statute,
the
statute
would
empower;
they
empower
the
regulator
to
withhold
papers
that
anyone
in
his
right
mind
would
say
are
private
papers.
would
you
suggest
that
then
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
to
that
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know
that
that
has
been
done
already.
that
has
been
done
already,
and
the
only
question
is,
is
there
some
adequate
procedure
to
sort
them
out
and
return
private
papers?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
now,
i
will
make
my
question
very
specific.
i
would
like
to
know
where
in
the
criteria
that
the
regulator
must
use
in
preparing
his
regulations,
where
in
those
criteria
is
any
assurance
given
that
purely
private
papers
will
be
returned
to
mr.
nixon?
and
even
more
precisely,
suppose
that
someone
like
a
regulator
claims
that
this
piece
of
paper,
even
though
purely
private,
is
of
general
historical
interest.
do
you
think
those
two
categories
are
mutually
exclusive?
