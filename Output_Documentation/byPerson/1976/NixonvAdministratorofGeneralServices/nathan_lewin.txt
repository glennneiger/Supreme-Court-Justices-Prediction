mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
in
the
time
available
to
me
to
speak
to
the
constitutional
standards
for
evaluating
the
statute
under
the
three
arguments
that
we
presented
in
our
brief,
because
we
think
the
standards
are
different
and
the
district
court
really
applied
a
balancing
test,
which
is
inappropriate
to
two
of
the
three
separate
arguments
that
are
made
in
our
brief.
but
just
momentarily
before
going
to
that
question,
and
i
think
in
some
way
it
does
relate
to
the
application
of
a
balancing
test
to
the
question
of
separation
of
powers,
i
believe
justices
white
and
rehnquist
did
raise
the
question
of
whether
this
statute
is
not
in
some
way
constitutionally
sufficient,
because
it
either
applies
only
retrospectively
to
one
president
or
because
it
might
by
its
application
really
be
read
to
give
president
nixon
an
opportunity
to
challenge
whenever
there
is
some
violation
of
presidential
confidentiality.
and
we
think
that
that
overlooks
the
basic
presumption
that
underlies
our
separation-of-powers
argument,
which
is
that
the
notion
of
separation
of
powers,
as
applied
to
statements
and
advice
given
to
a
president
in
confidence,
is
really
a
proposition
that
acts
in
futuro;
in
other
words,
only
if
a
presumption
of
confidentially
exists
do
existing
advisers
speak
frankly,
just
as
existing
law
clerks
will
speak
frankly
to
justices
of
this
court,
because
they
know
that
their
advice
is
given
in
confidence,
in
the
same
way,
the
near
possibility
that
a
statute
may
be
enacted
retrospectively
to
apply
to
president
ford
or
carter
or
the
possibility
that
a
president
may
be
put,
with
regard
to
every
individual
piece
of
paper
or
every
advice,
to
the
burden
of
litigating
it
at
some
future
time
and
asserting
his
presidential
privilege
is
sufficient
to
impede
the
free
flow
of
communication.
and
that
is
precisely
why
we
think
this
court
adapted
the
rule
of
presumption
of
confidentiality
and
stated
it
as
strongly
as
it
did
in
united
states
versus
nixon.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
that
the
present
justices'
law
clerks,
even
if
all
the
present
justices
said
there
was
no
problem,
i
think
the
justices
would
agree
that
the
present
law
clerks
and
their
own
relations
with
their
law
clerks
would
be
substantially
affected
by
the
existence,
and
indeed
by
the
judicial
imprimatur,
put
upon
such
as
statute.
it
would
mean
with
regard
to
your
own
law
clerks
that
after
you
left
the
court,
a
similar
statute
might
be
enacted;
and
even
though
you
might
think
today
that
it
does
not
concern
or
does
not
relate
to
the
way
you
operate
your
office,
the
successor
to
that
seat
might
differ
with
that
view.
and
consequently,
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
we
believe
that
no
present
occupant
of
a
position
such
as
the
presidency
or
such
as
an
article
iii
position,
on
this
court
or
on
any
federal
district
court
or
indeed
any
congressman
may
not
permanently
waive
those
elements
which
are
necessarily
incident
to
the
proper
functioning
of
that
office,
even
if
he
agrees
with
it
today,
and
that,
we
think,
is
the
basic
deficiency
in
the
argument
that
is
made
both
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
the
private
appellees
when
they
say
that
this
is
not
a
separation-of-powers
case.
indeed
it
is
in
every
sense,
because
the
issue
of
confidentiality
of
presidential
communications,
irrespective
of
what
the
president
incumbent
may
think
of
that
confidentiality,
is
a
question
which
is
decided
in
this
case
for
all
time
and
will
therefore
bind
future
presidents,
who
may
disagree
with
what
mr.
carter
believes
or
what
mr.
ford
believes,
if
indeed
mr.
ford
did
believe
that
it
made
no
difference.
we
submit
that
to
the
extent
that
there
was
really
any
indication
of
what
presidential
policy
was,
the
agreement,
which
is
in
the
record,
the
nixon-sampson
depository
agreement,
indicates
that
president
ford
believed
that
for
purposes
of
ongoing
government
business,
which
is
really,
i
think,
the
principle
thing
that
the
appellees
are
relying
on
in
this
case,
which
is
not
so
much
historical
interest,
although
that
is
talked
about
in
the
legislation;
but
in
the
briefs
before
this
court,
heavy
emphasis
is
placed
on
ongoing
government
business,
and
president
ford
was
entirely
satisfied
with
an
arrangement
between
himself
and
his
predecessor
under
which
he
would
be
given
access.
and
we
think
that
is
what
200
years
of
history
have
shown,
that
that
is
satisfied
by
arrangements
between
succeeding
presidents.
the
congress
had
before
it
no
record
of
extensive
disagreement
or
of
extensive
situations
which
presented
problems
with
regard
to
future
presidents
obtaining
records
that
their
predecessors
may
have
had,
and
indeed
the
appellees
have
only
plucked
out
of
an
entire
200-year
history
basically,
i
think,
one
two
or
at
most
three
instances
where
there
was
a
request
which
was
honored,
and
indeed
only
one
situation
where
there
was
a
lower-level
request
which
was
not
honored
as
between
successor
presidents,
and
that
was
not
by
the
president
in
office,
but
by
a
very
low-ranking
individual
who
would
made
a
call
to
john
eisenhower
and
asked
him
whether
he
might
have
a
paper
and
where
mr.
eisenhower
said,
“we
will
have
that
request
made
by
the
president
himself”,
the
request
was
never
made.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
privilege
is,
in
terms
of
policy
reasons,
i
think
it
is
even
greater.
i
have
only
analogized
it
in
terms
of
law
clerks,
because
with
this
court,
and
i
believe
with
every
individual
judge
who
sits,
the
analog,
i
would
think,
to
the
president,
who
is
at
very
top
of
the
executive
structure,
who
is
the
chief
executive,
are
the
subordinates
to
that
president;
and
consequently,
in
order
to
provide
the
closest
analogy,
i
tried
to
compare
it
to
those
who
worked
for
justices
of
the
court.
but
certainly
to
the
extent
that
there
are
internal
judicial
branch
discussions,
which
by
approving
this
kind
of
statute
this
court
would
be
saying
congress
might
very
well
reach
those
kinds
of
papers,
i
think
the
very
same
problem
exists,
and
indeed
that
very
report
which
mr.
miller
was
referring
to,
i
think,
was
suggesting
that
there
would
be
restraints
placed
on
the
ability
of
justices
to
destroy
papers,
which
the
leading
justices
in
the
history
of
this
court
down
to
very
modern
times
have
assumed
they
had
certainly
the
right
to
do
in
terms
of
internal
papers.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
totally
separate
problem.
we
are
not
here
today
arguing
anything,
really,
that
goes
to
what
ownership
rights
may
be
except
to
the
extent
that
they
bear
on
mr.
nixon’s
expectations
on
what
the
proper
constitutional
rule
is,
on
how
the
country
is
operated.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
and
if
i
could
just
in
the
very
few
minutes
i
have,
i
would
like
to
speak
on
that
bill-of-attainder
argument,
because
i
think
that
here,
too,
the
court
below
has
mistaken
the
proper
constitutional
standard.
congress
could
have
enacted
a
law
if
it
thought
on
the
basis
of
its
various
investigations
and
the
discussions
of
the
floor
of
the
senate
that
mr.
nixon
was
an
unreliable
custodian
of
documents,
it
could
have
enacted
a
law
that
said
any
unreliable
custodian
of
documents,
be
it
a
president,
vice
president
or
any
other
federal
officer,
may
have
those
documents
taken
away
from
him
if
it
is
shown
in
a
judicial
forum
that
he
is
an
unreliable
custodian;
and
there
could
be
temporary
retraining
orders,
preliminary
injunctions,
every
remedy
that
this
statute
provides.
what
does
this
statute
do
more
than
that
statute
does?
it
makes
congress
the
fact-finder,
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
has
said
in
a
series
of
cases,
culminating
with
united
states
versus
brown,
that
congress
may
not
be
the
fact-finder.
and
why
may
congress
not
be
the
fact
finder?
because
in
that
case,
the
party
against
whom
it
finds
the
facts
has
no
judicial
trial,
no
counsel
to
represent
him,
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
or
present
witnesses
in
his
defense.
the
entire
range
of
what
judicial
trial
is
all
about
is
obviated.
in
this
case,
congress
held
not
a
single
hearing
on
this
statute.
it
did
hold
hearings
on
a
predecessor
statute
looking
to
the
question
of
federal
officials'
records
generally,
but
not
on
this
statute.
there
was
no
opportunity
other
than
statements
made
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
just
assertions,
which
were
picked
up
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
to
the
notion
that
mr.
nixon
is
an
unreliable
custodian
for
historical
purposes.
and
we
submit
that
what
the
bill-of-attainder
clause
says
is
that
the
congress
may
not
make
that
ultimate
factual
finding,
and
here
it
has
done
it,
it
has
mentioned
richard
nixon
by
name.
congress
did
not
even
dare
do
anything
in
the
brown
case
and
this
court
has
mentioned
that
certainly
archie
brown
has
been
mentioned
by
name
as
someone
who
could
not
occupy
a
union
office;
that
would
be
a
bill
of
attainder.
and
here,
congress
has
said
richard
nixon
is
the
person
who
cannot
decide
which
papers
are
confidential
and
which
papers
are
not.
that
aspect
of
the
presidency
and
what
carries
on
with
it
after
the
president
leaves
office
is
taken
away
from
him.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
your
suggestion
was
that
there
was
an
effect
on
the
bill
of
attainder,
because
he
has
also
been
deprived
of
ownership
of
these
papers.
i
think
that
may
very
well
be
true.
in
addition
to
that,
he
has
been
deprived
of
custody,
of
access,
of
any
meaningful
opportunity
to
have
those
documents
in
the
way
that
former
presidents
have,
and
the
archie
brown
case
also
says
that
even
preventive
purposes,
even
entirely
preventive
purposes,
are
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
the
bill
of
attainder.
thank
you.
