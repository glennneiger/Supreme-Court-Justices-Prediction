mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
requires
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
presidential
recordings
and
material
preservation
act
that
provide
for
the
impoundment
and
classification
by
officials
of
the
executive
branch
of
certain
materials
generated
during
the
administration
of
the
former
president
and
left
by
him
temporarily
in
the
white
house
following
his
resignation
facially
offends
the
constitution.
we
emphasis
"facially",
because
the
act
became
effective
on
december
19,
1974,
and
this
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
other
relief
was
filed
december
20th,
before
any
action
was
taken
under
the
statute.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe
my
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
white,
is,
the
appellant
contends
that
the
act
is
invalid
in
many
respects;
but
our
response
is
that
there
is
a
severability
clause,
and
in
the
event
this
court
should
find
a
provision
of
it
invalid,
it
would
not
invalidate
the
entire
legislation.
appellant
contends
that
the
act
violates
the
principle
of
the
separation
of
powers,
the
prohibition
against
bills
of
attainder
and
his
right
to
privacy
and
liberty
of
political
expression
and
association.
the
government
submits
that
the
congress
acted
constitutionally
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
as
my
brother
has
pointed
out,
the
act
requires
the
administrator
of
general
services
to
take
possession
and
complete
control
of
the
materials
to
prevent
their
destruction
except
as
required
by
law;
to
make
them
available
for
use
in
any
judicial
proceeding
or
otherwise
subject
to
legal
process,
subject
to
any
rights,
defenses
or
privileges
that
any
one,
including
the
former
president,
might
raise.
the
act
also
requires
the
administrator
of
general
services
to
afford
former
president
richard
m.
nixon
access
at
all
times
consistent
with
the
act
and
to
afford
access
to
the
executive
branch,
and
i
stress
executive
branch,
for
lawful
government
use.
and
then,
of
course,
it
requires
the
issuance
of
regulations
to
prevent
loss
and
destruction
and
ultimately
to
submit
to
the
congress
regulations
relating
to
public
access,
and
i
stress
the
distinction
between
the
two
sets
of
regulations,
taking
into
account
seven
enumerated
factors
denominated
as
needs,
which
i
suggest
we
need
not
discuss
in
detail,
because
these
regulations
had
not
been
promulgated
at
the
time
of
the
attack
on
the
statute
was
made,
have
not
yet
taken
place,
because
they
require
congressional
acquiescence
to
become
effective,
and
that
acquiescence
in
the
two
efforts
that
were
attempted
was
not
forthcoming.
finally,
the
act
provides
for
the
appropriation
of
money
if
a
court
should
determine
that
a
provision
of
the
legislation
should
deprive
an
individual
of
private
property
without
just
compensation.
and
so
at
this
point
i
reiterate,
since
there
are
no
regulations
providing
for
public
access
and
only
regulations
for
safekeeping,
which
are
not
before
the
court,
as
my
brother
indicated,
and
are
not
part
of
the
record
here,
because
indeed
the
appellant
has
not
claimed
that
they
breach
any
rights
of
his.
we
suggest
respectfully
that
this
court
should
limit
its
inquiry
to
the
face
of
the
statute
and
should
not
be
concerned
with
the
many
hypothetical
horrors,
as
the
district
court
characterized
them,
that
appellant
suggests
might
occur
at
some
future
time.
we
suggest
the
proper
time
to
consider
these
hobgoblins
may
be
when
the
public-access
regulations
will
have
been
promulgated
and
will
have
become
effective,
and
there
will
have
been
decisions
with
respect
to
particular
materials.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe
if
the
congress
apprehended
some
great
harm
to
the
republic,
it
could
prevent
the
destruction
of
records
in
the
custody
of
any
public
officer.
now,
there
would
be
restrictions
on
its
power
to
do
it;
but
i
would
think
the
congress
would
have
that
power
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
public
records
by
any
public
custodian
thereof.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
congress,
if
the
court
please,
has
the
power
and
even
the
duty
to
protect
government
property,
and
that
is
a
specific
charge
that
the
congress
has
set.
and
i
think
the
congress,
if
it
apprehends
the
destruction
of
public
property,
has
the
responsibility
to
provide
for
it;
but
it
must
provide
for
means
adequate
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
branch
of
government
that
is
concerned,
to
protect
personal
rights,
executive
privilege,
judicial
rights,
judicial
privileges.
but
in
response
to
the
chief
justice’s
inquiry,
yes,
i
think
the
congress
has
the
power
to
protect
the
papers
from
destruction.
now,
what
it
can
do
with
it
after
that
is
quite
a
different
matter.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
would
make
any
difference,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
if
these
are
public
papers,
if
they
belong
to
the
government
or
if
the
government
has
a
substantial
interest
in
them,
and
there
was
apprehension
about
their
destruction
before
this
can
be
ascertained,
i
think
the
congress
has
that
power.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
submit
it
is
not.
i
think
if
the
government
has
a
sufficient
interest
in
them,
the
government
may
have
an
interest
that
would
require
it
to
copy
the
papers.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
papers
might
indicate
material
useful
in
the
salt
talks
that
have
just
been
recently
pursued.
they
might
have
information
that
would
be
necessary
in
matters
of
national
security
that
the
executive
branch
should
have
access
to,
and
if
these
papers
were
in
danger
of
destruction,
i
would
think
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
provide
for
their
protection
until
their
contents
could
be
made
available
to
the
appropriate
persons.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
i
have
to
at
this
time,
and
i
am
not
aware
that
the
congress
has
that
power;
but
i
just
do
not
think
i
have
to
reach
that
question
at
this
time,
and
i
do
not
think
this
act
does.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
concede,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
on
its
face,
if
it
instructed
or
authorized
the
impoundment
of
purely
private
papers,
i
would
not
be
here
to
defend
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
i
may
respond,
the
papers
were
comingled
by
the
former
president,
and
some
method
has
to
be
employed
to
determine
what
papers
are
private
and
what
papers
are
public
or
affected
with
such
a
public
interest
that
they
may
be
retained.
and
a
procedure
has
been
established
to
classify
it.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
that
it
may
be
difficult
to
separate
them;
but
if
the
court
please,
section
104
provides
as
the
seventh
of
the
enumerated
needs
on
page
4(a)
of
appellant’s
brief
one
finds
that,
that
the
regulations
shall
take
into
account
among
other
things
the
need
to
give
to
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
or
his
heirs
for
his
sole
custody
and
use
tape
recordings
and
other
materials
which
are
not
likely
to
be
related
to
the
need
described
in
the
foregoing
paragraphs,
and
so
there
is
no
intention.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
and
are
not
otherwise
of
general
historical
significance.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
may
i
refer
the
court
to
need
number
five,
the
need
to
protect
any
party's
opportunity
to
assert
any
legally
or
constitutionally
based
writer
privilege
which
would
prevent
or
otherwise
limit
access
to
such
recordings
and
materials.
and
i
submit
that
this
act
affords
richard
m.
nixon
the
opportunity
to
assert
the
contention
that
this
diary
of
his
is
personal
and
has
not
the
kind
of
general
historical
significance
that
will
permit
his
deprivation,
and
that
would
then
have
to
be
adjudicated
in
a
court;
and
ultimately,
this
court
will
answer
that
question.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
indeed,
i
do.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
must
concede
being
acquainted
with
some
historians
that
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
anything
that
might
not
be
of
historical
interest.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
indeed,
they
are.
but
this
legislation
recognizes
that
a
claim
of
privacy,
a
claim
of
privilege,
must
be
protected;
and
if
the
regulations
are
insufficient
to
do
that,
again,
a
court
will
have
an
opportunity
to
address
itself
to
a
particular
item,
such
as
a
diary,
before
it
can
be
turned
over.
and
for
that
reason,
we
suggest
that
the
attack
at
this
time
is
premature,
because
the
statute,
in
recognizing
the
right
of
privacy,
is
facially
adequate.
and
the
attack
that
was
made
the
day
after
it
became
effective
brought
to
this
court
a
marvelous
opportunity
to
speculate
about
what
might
happen;
but
the
regulations
have
not
even
been
promulgated
and
acquiesced
in
so
that
they
have
become
effective.
and
this
court
is
asked
to
speculate
about
any
number
of
horrors,
as
the
court
below
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
has,
and
it
has
been
done
for
the
purpose
of
safekeeping
and
preventing
destruction;
but
the
sorting
and
sifting
has
not
even
been
begun.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
believe
it
might
for
safekeeping,
but
it
would
have
to
set
up
reasons
for
doing
it
indicating
why
and
provisions
for
returning
to
him
everything
that
it
could
not
appropriately
take
from
him,
and
this
statute
purports
to
do
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reconsider
my
response.
i
am
not
certain
it
would
have
to.
i
am
not
certain
it
would
have
to
except
we
assumed
that
the
congress
acts
because
of
a
perceived
need
to
act.
now,
it
does
not
have
to
recite
in
the
statute,
if
this
is
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
inquiring,
why
it
so
acted.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
house
committee
report.
it's
house
of
representatives’
report
on
page
3,
where
we
find
two
significant
items.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
not
certain
that
this
specific
reference
is.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
i
just
might
be
permitted
to
read
the
line.
in
speaking
of
the
agreement,
which
former
president
nixon
enacted
with
mr.
sampson,
the
administrator
of
general
services,
which
agreement
was
abrogated
by
this
statute,
thus
the
agreement
gives
mr.
nixon
total
control
over
all
the
materials
and
records
of
his
administration.
it
allows
him
to
have
access
to
the
materials,
but
excludes
others
from
reviewing
these
records.
then
by
allowing
mr.
nixon
to
destroy
all
the
materials,
the
agreement
ignores
the
public
interest
in
preserving
them.
and
so
we
have
some
evidence
of
congressional
abrogation.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
unable
to
differentiate
it.
i
must
concede
that
it
follows
a
paragraph
that
provides
for
the
destruction
of
the
tapes
at
a
stated
date,
september
1,
'79,
or
his
death
at
a
sooner
date.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
except,
if
the
court
please,
it
permitted
him
sole
access
and
the
opportunity
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
committee
report
contains
this
characterization
of
the
agreement,
and
i
quote
again
from
page
3:
"this
agreement
would
permit
mr.
nixon
to
remove
and
destroy
any
of
these
documents
if
he
wishes
to
do
so,"
and
that
certainly
appears
to
evidence
concern,
apprehension,
that
it
might
indeed
have.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
coupled
with
historical
facts,
including
the
unexplained
erasure
of
eighteen-and-a-half
minutes
of
a
taped
recording,
it
would
appear
to
be
more
than
just
a
platter.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
not
aware
that
that
recital
appears
in
the
committee
report;
but
reference
is
made
to
it
in
both
briefs,
and
there
is
a
record
reference
to
it
that
i
am
not
able
to
furnish
at
this
time.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
there
are
similarities
and
differences,
if
the
court
please.
the
same
people
essentially
are
doing
the
screening
as
accomplished
it
under
the
presidential
libraries
legislation,
the
archival
section
of
the
general
services
administration,
and
indeed
this
act
provides
that
these
archivists,
who
are
professional
persons,
as
the
court
of
course
knows,
with
ethical
standards
to
which
to
adhere
and
so
forth,
will
also
screen
the
material
here,
and
i
submit
also
it
is
within
the
same
branch
of
government;
it
is
not
outside
the
executive
branch
of
government.
so
in
that
respect,
it
is
the
same.
the
difference
is,
under
the
presidential
libraries
act,
previous
presidents
have
been
permitted
to,
or
no
one
has
tried
to
stop
them,
have
indeed
established
conditions
concerning
access
to
their
papers
provided
for
periods
of
time
when
they
will
be
closed
to
everyone
and
provided
various
methods
for
access
and
release.
the
congress,
though,
over
the
years
has
passed
a
series
of
amendments
to
the
congressional
libraries
act
until
this
really
happens
to
be
the
last
one
in
line,
although
it
is
not
of
general
application.
but
if
the
court
please
…
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
is
a
statement
in
the
record,
and
i
regret,
mr.
justice
powell,
that
i
cannot
refer
to
it
specifically.
i
do
not
think
the
number
is
that
high;
but
it
could
be
when
one
considers
that
there
are
42
million
documents
and
800
hours
of
tape.
but
100
sounds
quite
high,
and
i
would
just
have
to
find
that
for
the
court
and
furnish
it
to
the
court.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
mr.
justice
powell,
i
have
heard
that
if
two
people
have
heard
it,
it
will
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
but
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers.
viewed
on
its
face,
as
we
suggest
the
statute
must
be
viewed,
instead
of
being
an
encroachment
on
powers
reserved
to
the
executive
branch,
the
act
entrusts
the
material
to
the
custody
of
the
administrator
of
general
services,
an
executive
official
appointed
by
the
president
and
responsible
to
him;
and
so
the
suggestion
that
there
would
be
any
compromise
of
the
integrity
of
the
executive
branch
appears
not
to
have
force,
because
the
person
who
will
supervise
the
archivists
who
will
do
the
classifications
is
responsible
to
the
president.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
may
i
refer
the
court
to
the
government’s
brief,
the
bottom
of
page
50
and
the
top
of
page
51,
where
there
is
a
reference
to
specific
house
determinations
of
a
specific
fear.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
government
does
not
suggest
that
there
must
be
such
a
finding.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
the
government
acknowledges
that
there
was
such
a
finding,
but
suggests
that
since
no
punishment
was
imposed
or
is
imposed
by
the
act
that
the
prohibition
against
a
bill
of
attainder
is
not
violated.
that
is
our
response
to
the
attainder
argument.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
indeed,
there
can
be.
indeed,
there
can
be;
but
that
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
certainly
do
not.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
well,
our
understanding
is
that
the
prohibition
against
a
bill
of
attainder
is
a
prohibition
against
something
more
traditionally
associated
with
punishment
than
injury
to
a
person’s
reputation.
in
fact,
we
would
submit
that
going
through
a
congressional
investigation
is
not
likely
to
assist
a
person
in
maintaining
a
good
reputation;
but
no
one
suggests,
i
think,
that
that
violates
the
attainder
prohibition.
if
the
court
please,
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
we
would
like
to
touch
on
one
or
two
other
matters.
we
submit
that
facially
the
act
does
not
invade
the
president’s
right
of
privacy
or
any
executive
privilege.
the
act
specifically
provides
that
these
are
concerns
with
which
the
general
services
administrator
is
to
be
aware
in
the
promulgation
of
his
regulations
and
his
determination
of
allowing
access,
public
or
private,
to
these
papers;
and
the
right
of
former
president
nixon
to
assert
these
privileges
is
given
to
him
by
the
statute,
and
we
submit
a
court,
perhaps
this
court,
will
have
to
determine
whether
an
asserted
right
exists
and
whether
it
must
yield
to
an
overriding
interest,
as
it
did
in
united
states
versus
nixon.
and
so
facially
the
act
protects
these
interests
about
which
my
brother
expressed
so
much
concern.
finally,
we
suggest
that
the
commingling
of
these
papers
was
the
act
of
the
former
president,
and
for
him
to
suggest
that
the
fourth
amendment
prevents
the
sifting
of
these
papers
to
determine
what
are
clearly
his
private
papers
and
what
are
papers
pertaining
to
matters
in
the
public
interest
to
which
the
executive
branch
should
have
access
is
something
of
his
doing
and
that
he
should
not
be
heard
to
complain
about
it.
the
fourth
amendment
bars
unreasonable
searches,
and
the
government
submits
that
the
imperatives
of
national
security
and
other
aspects
of
the
public
interest
make
such
an
inspection
eminently
reasonable.
professor
paul
frayne
wrote:
“history
is
a
way
of
mocking
those
specters
of
disaster
forecast
from
judicial
decisions.”
the
government
believes
that
so
long
as
the
courts
retain
their
resourcefulness
in
applying
precedents,
their
authority
to
reconsider
doctrines
in
the
light
of
the
lessons
of
experience
and
the
force
of
better
reasoning,
that
the
fears
of
irreparable
harm
which
we
have
heard
here
today
are
likely
to
prove
exaggerated.
we
submit
that
on
its
face
the
statute
is
constitutional,
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
there
is
a
power
--
i
cannot
give
you
the
exact
language
--
to
preserve
and
protect
public
property,
and
i
certainly
think
that
one,
and
i
think
the
necessary
and
proper
…
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
perhaps
for
some
purpose.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
the
concept
of
property
has
many
aspects.
perhaps
the
government
might
have
an
interest,
not
a
propriety
interest,
but
the
kind
of
interest
that
would
be
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
congress.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
some
of
these
papers
may
contain
information
furnished
to
the
negotiators
for
our
nation
in
the
salt
talks.
information
perhaps
concerning
the
number
of
nuclear
submarines
that
we
possess
capable
of
launching
subsurface
missiles,
these
are
matters
that
the
ongoing
administration,
whatever
it
is,
must
have
access
to
if
it
is
adequately
to
protect
our
security.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
no.
if
the
court
please,
the
answer
is,
no,
there
is
no
word
to
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
am
not
suggesting
that.
i
can
advise
the
court
that
i
am
aware
that
there
has
been
retrieval
of
certain
documents
of
the
type
generally
relating
to
national
security
from
these
papers
since
they
have
been
in
the
custody
of
the
administrator
of
the
general
services
administration;
and
with
42
million
commingled
documents,
some
method
of
retrieval
must
be
established
if
a
critical
document
is
to
be
found
within
a
time
within
which
it
can
be
useful
to
our
nation.
and
this
also
is
provided
for
by
the
act,
access,
and
contrary
to
what
my
brother
says,
to
members
of
any
department
or
agency
of
the
executive
branch
--
he
neglected
to
emphasize
that
--
and
there
has
been
that.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
do
not
have
that
figures
at
my
fingertips,
if
the
court
please;
more
that
i
think,
i
suspect.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
would,
because
the
statute
mandates
protecting
any
information
relating
to
the
nation’s
security
and
any
legal
or
constitutionally
based
rights
or
privileges,
so
i
would
expect
executive
privilege
to
be
protected
from
any
unauthorized
invasion.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
my
only
response
to
that
can
be
this.
the
previous
presidents
have
taken
their
papers
subject
to
no
restrictions
whatsoever,
which
means
that
an
ambassador
would
have
to
believe
that
anything
that
he
spoke
to
another
president
might
be
discovered
by
persons
not
even
under
the
restrictions
that
these
responsible
government
archivists
submit
to.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
life
of
president
john
f.
kennedy
terminated
in
office,
and
he
did
not
have
that
privilege.
his
estate,
his
executors,
were
the
ones
to
make
that
decision,
not
having
the
sensitivity
perhaps
about
some
of
these
matters
that
the
archivists
might.
so
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
accordingly,
sir.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
we
believe
it
is.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
would
think
that
is
a
personal
matter
that
should
be
returned
to
him
once
it
was
identified.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
i
know
of
no
problem.
whether
it
would
have
to
await
the
adoption
of
a
regulation
which
has
been
stymied
by
mr.
nixon’s
lawsuit,
which
has
been
delayed
for
three
years
--
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
one
of
the
dispositions
of
the
district
court
was
to
stay
the
effectiveness
of
regulations.
now,
i
think
it
held
up
principally
the
regulations
for
public
access;
the
other
regulations
are
not
part
of
this
record,
and
i
cannot
speak
to
the
court
with
any
knowledge
about
them.
mr.
wade
h.
mccree,
jr.
of
course,
as
the
court
knows,
two
sets
of
regulations
were
sent
to
the
congress
and
were
disapproved.
these
were
regulations
for
public
access
and
not
the
103
regulations.
and
the
103
regulations
are
to
assure
the
protection
of
the
tape
recordings
and
other
materials
and
to
prevent
access
by
unauthorized
persons
and
so
forth.
so
i
just
cannot
answer
that
except
to
say
that
certainly
the
private
diary
should
be
returned.
no
one
would
make
any
problem
about
that.
