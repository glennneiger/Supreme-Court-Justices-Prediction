unknown
speaker
well,
subject
to
the
regulations
which
the
administrators
shall
issue.
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
at
this
point,
you
are
just
factually
describing
the
effect
of
the
congressional
legislation,
right?
unknown
speaker
are
the
regulations
in
the
material
has
been
submitted
to
us,
mr.
miller?
unknown
speaker
insofar
as
that
is
a
separation-of-powers
argument,
mr.
miller,
the
act
applies
only
to
former
president
nixon.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
is
going
to
pass
an
act
that
is
generally
applicable
to
presidents
in
the
future,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
be
time
enough,
i
take
it,
to
confront
anything
congress
does
in
response
to
that
report
when
it
does
it.
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
not
any
impairment
of
any
presently
conducted
executive
function
by
the
act,
where
there
was
in
myers’
or
humphrey’s
executive.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
still
object
to
this
act
if
on
its
face
it
simply
says
--
and
maybe
this
one
does
--
that
anything
that
would
threaten
the
executive
privilege
or
anything
that
would
threaten
to
reveal
the
kinds
of
papers
that
might
inhibit
free
and
open
discussion
between
the
president
and
his
aides
will
be
destroyed
or
that
they
will
never
be
made
public?
unknown
speaker
not
the
records,
but
that
they
will
be
sorted
out.
surely
you
do
not
say
that
every
piece
of
paper
out
of
this
entire
straw
stack
of
papers
is
privileged.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume,
then,
you
could
divide
them
into
two
parts
and
without
any
idea
of
what
the
relative
volume
of
each
part
might
be;
but
assume
that
they
had
been
divided
into
two
parts,
and
one
part
is
privileged;
and
suppose
the
act
said
once
you
get
them
divided
into
two
parts
and
you
know
what
the
privileged
information
is,
that
will
not
be
made
public.
will
that
satisfy
you
or
not,
your
separation-of-powers
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
things
are
intermixed,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
review
them
and
divide
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
doesn't
it
go
to
your
separation-of-powers
argument
that
not
only
are
some
things
privileged,
but
only
the
president
should
decide
which
are,
or
the
former
president?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
anything
contemplated
under
this
act
necessarily
going
to
prevent
the
former
president
from
examining
these
papers
and
giving
his
opinion
as
to
which
are
privileged?
unknown
speaker
have
not
presidents
all
the
way
back
to
president
washington
declined
to
give
to
congress
as
distinguished
from
the
courts,
declined
to
give
to
congress
certain
papers
under
the
doctrine
of
executive
privilege?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
and
are
making
it
with
respect
to
a
subpoena
directed
to
our
conference
notes.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
suggest,
would
you,
that
this
stands
on
the
same
footing
as
if
congress
had
decided
to
take
five-and-a-half
years
of
your
papers,
you
being
a
private
citizen.
unknown
speaker
does
this
act
now
authorize
any
other
government
officials
who
wants
to
look
at
any
part
of
this
collection
of
papers
give
him
the
right
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
even
if
anyone
who
was
halfway
fair-minded
would
concede
that
this
is
a
purely
private
piece
of
paper,
he
may
see
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
mean?
how
can
something
purely
private
and
personal
be
of
lawful
government
use?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
statute
say
"subject
to
the
regulations"?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
does.
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
not
in
the
record
before
us.
unknown
speaker
well,
those
have
been
adopted,
and
those
are
not
the
ones
that
were
rejected
by
congress?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so
they
are
not
rejected,
so
they
must
be
in
the
federal
registry.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
regulations
permitting
access
by
the
government
officials,
do
they
have
restrictions
in
them?
unknown
speaker
does
mr.
nixon
or
his
representatives
get
notice
any
time
any
government
official
wants
to
look
at
any
part
of
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so
if
some
other
department
of
the
government
wanted
to
for
some
supposedly
lawful
purpose
examine
some
of
the
papers,
mr.
nixon
would
have
notice
of
it?
unknown
speaker
does
the
act
contain
any
penalties
for
disclosure
by
any
employee
of
the
many
employees
who
would
have
access
to
this?
unknown
speaker
ah,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
do
the
regulations
deal
with
the
question
of
impermissible
disclosure?
suppose
some
clerk
or
any
one
of
the
many
people
dealing
with
this
screening
process
makes
a
xerox
copy
and
sells
it
to
someone.
do
you
say
that
there
is
no
penalty
at
all
on
that?
unknown
speaker
but
no
criminal
penalty.
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
before
you
sit
down,
could
i
ask
one
question?
is
there
any
issue
presented
with
respect
to
the
materials
that
mr.
nixon
took
out
of
the
government
custody?
a
footnote
in
the
government's
brief
points
out
that
some
materials
are
in
his
custody,
and
i
would
think
section
101(b)(1)
may
read
on
those
materials.
is
there
any
issue
with
respect
to
that?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
really
wanted
to
ask.
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
enforce
101(b)(1)
yet.
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
why
there
has
been
no
effort
to
enforce
that
section?
unknown
speaker
but
the
analogy
here,
mr.
lewin,
is
a
former
justice
of
this
court
comes
in
and
objects
to
a
law
that
congress
has
passed,
and
all
the
present
justices
say,
"we
don't
see
any
problem
with
it".
unknown
speaker
i
am
a
little
puzzled
by
your
repeated
reference
to
the
judicial
area,
the
communications
between
law
clerks
and
justices
and
judges.
what
about
communications
as
among
the
justices
and
judges
themselves?
would
you
think
they
are
a
lesser
or
greater
privilege?
unknown
speaker
previous
presidents
have
received
substantial
tax
benefits
by
virtue
of
claimed
ownership,
have
they
not,
of
their
papers?
unknown
speaker
does
it
bear
on
your
bill-of-attainder
arguments?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
am
not
sure
this
bear
directly;
but
do
you
think
congress
can
enact
a
statute
impounding
the
papers
of
federal
judges
generally
or
judges
of
one
particular
category
or
level,
circuit
judges,
supreme
court
justices,
or
a
particular
supreme
court
or
other
judge
or
justice?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
a
proceeding
would
be
necessary
to
make
that
determination?
presumably,
your
response
indicates
there
would
first
be
a
finding
or
a
determination.
by
what
process
would
the
congress
make
that?
i
don't
assume
you
mean
it
would
be
just
to
see
nixon
and
the
legislative
branch.
unknown
speaker
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
sustain
your
proposition
for
us
to
find
that
the
government,
in
fact,
owns
the
papers
in
question?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
carry
that
over
to
papers
in
the
hands
of
a
private
individual,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
just
finish
the
provision.
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
suppose
mr.
nixon
has
prepared
a
diary
every
day
and
put
down
exactly
what
he
did,
and
let's
suppose
that
someone
thought
that
was
a
purely
personal
account.
now,
i
can
just
imagine
that
someone
might
think
it
nevertheless
is
of
general
historical
significance.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you
would
agree,
then,
that
104
must
be
construed
to
sooner
or
later
return
to
mr.
nixon
what
we
might
call
purely
private
papers.
unknown
speaker
can
you
imagine
any
diary,
thinking
of
mr.
truman’s
diary,
which
it
was
reported
was
a
result
of
being
dictated
every
evening
after
the
day’s
work,
can
you
conceive
of
any
such
material
that
would
not
be
of
general
historical
interest?
unknown
speaker
archivists
and
historians,
like
journalists,
think
that
everything
is
historical.
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
have
to
set
up
reasons
for
so
doing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
are
you
saying
you
have
emphasized
the
danger
of
destruction
as
an
important
justification,
as
i
understand
it,
for
this
kind
of
legislation.
are
we
to
assume
that
congress
has
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
there
was
a
danger
of
destruction
and
that
mr.
nixon
wan
as
unreliable
custodian;
and,
if
so,
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
the
bill
of
attainder?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
your
brief,
mr.
solicitor
general,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
excuse
me.
i
have
to
ask
for
a
citation
on
that.
unknown
speaker
did
that
reference
concern
the
problem
of
immediate
destruction,
or
was
that
talking
about
destruction
at
a
future
date?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
that
agreement
did
not
contemplate
the
immediate
destruction
of
any
of
these
materials.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
perhaps
--
sole
access;
but
you
are
saying
this
statute
may
be
justified
because
of
the
danger
of
destruction,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
agreement
prevented
the
very
danger
that
you
are
describing
for
a
limited
period
of
time
and
therefore
would
have
permitted
a
careful
deliberation
of
an
appropriate
statute
applying
to
all
presidents.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
a
statement
of
fact
that
would
apply
to
every
employee
of
the
united
states
government,
from
the
president
down
to
the
lowliest
doorkeeper,
that
it
affords
the
opportunity?
is
that
a
finding
of
apprehension?
unknown
speaker
did
congress
recite
that
factor?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
do
not
know
whether
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
biographical
writings
of
former
presidents
or
other
public
officials;
but
if
we
can,
it
is
quite
clear
from
what
mr.
lyndon
johnson
wrote
and
what
harry
truman
wrote
that
when
they
left
the
white
house,
they
had
with
their
own
resources,
plus
the
resources
furnished
by
acts
of
congress,
a
completely
private
screening
under
the
exclusive
control
of
the
former
president
of
all
the
papers
to
separate
the
personal
from
the
truly
public
or
even
some
of
the
historical
matters.
and
the
biographical
material
of
former
justices
of
this
court
indicates
that
is
generally
the
process
they
follow.
do
you
see
a
difference
exist
between
having
that
screening
process
under
the
sole
control
of
the
individual
and
the
process
provided
by
congress;
and,
if
so,
whether
there
are
any
constitutional
implications
in
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
before
you
move
on,
do
you
have
any
idea
approximately
as
to
how
many
archivists,
secretaries,
lawyers
and
other
staff
personnel
have
or
will
have
access
to
these
documents?
i
think
mr.
miller
mentioned
100
archivists.
would
it
be
100?
unknown
speaker
well,
depending
on
the
paper’s
case,
so
to
speak.
that
is
not
two,
but
it's
very
few.
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
return
for
a
moment
to
the
question?
i
did
not
really
follow
through
enough
on
it
about
the
question
of
danger
of
destruction.
i
suppose
there
is
always
a
possibility
of
destruction;
if
that
is
enough,
why,
then
that
would
justify
legislation
of
this
kind
with
respect
to
any
retiring
official.
but
we
to
take
it
that
the
view
the
government
is
that
the
house
committee
and
the
legislation
is
predicated
on
a
finding
that
there
was
some
abnormal
danger
of
destruction
that
does
not
always
exists
with
respect
to
any
retiring
official?
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
want
to
be
sure
you
get
the
full
import
of
my
question.
i
assume
you
could
find
support
for
the
view
that
there
is
such
a
finding.
what
i
wanted
to
know
is
what
the
government’s
position
is,
because
if
you
say
the
legislature
made
such
a
finding,
that
may
undermine
your
position
on
the
bill-of-attainder
point.
it
seems
to
me
you
must
take
a
position
one
way
or
the
other,
and
the
position
must
be
relevant
to
two
arguments
that
your
opponents
make.
i
am
just
curious
on
what
your
position
is.
unknown
speaker
no,
my
question
is,
does
the
government
suggest
there
was
such
a
finding?
unknown
speaker
can
there
be
a
violation
of
a
protected
interest
by
the
impact
of
such
a
finding
on
a
person’s
reputation?
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
take
the
view
that
this
finding
that
you
described
has
had
no
impact
on
this
man’s
reputation?
unknown
speaker
then
why
is
it
not
so?
unknown
speaker
general
mccree,
the
national
government
is,
of
course,
one
of
delegated
powers,
i
suppose.
which
delegated
power
was
congress
exercising,
do
you
think,
under
its
powers
under
article
i
when
it
passed
this
legislation?
unknown
speaker
would
the
power
to
preserve
government
property
depend
on
a
finding
by
this
court
that
it
was
government
property?
unknown
speaker
general
mccree,
you
mentioned
national
defense
as
one
of
the
justifications
for
the
act.
would
you
elaborate
on
that
a
bit?
unknown
speaker
is
there
one
word
in
the
record
anywhere
that
suggests
any
danger
that
a
former
president
of
united
states
would
destroy
a
record
related
to
national
defense?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
representing
to
this
court
that
there
was
any
danger
known
to
your
office,
also
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
known
to
the
congress,
that
documents
pertaining
to
national
defense
would
have
been
destroyed.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you.
how
many
agencies
and
departments
are
there
in
the
executive
branch,
mr.
solicitor
general?
unknown
speaker
i
suspect
you
are
right.
and
there
are
a
couple
of
million
people
in
the
executive
branch,
i
think.
but
put
that
aside
for
the
moment.
i
have
another
question
i
would
like
to
ask.
if
you
were
a
foreign
diplomat
and
this
act
is
sustained,
would
you
feel
as
free
to
divulge
state
secrets
to
the
president
of
united
states
as
you
would
have
felt
prior
to
the
enactment
to
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
there
will
be
at
least
several
hundred
people
reading
or
listening
to
what
the
ambassador
of
this
country
or
that
country
said
to
the
president
of
the
united
states.
do
you
really
think
that
that
invasion
would
be
kept
confidential?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
after
this
former
president
that
you
hypothesize
has
gone
through
the
process
of
selecting
and
segregating,
which
each
of
the
former
presidents,
according
to
his
own
account,
has
done.
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
result
of
this
legislation,
there
has
been
almost
a
three-year
delay
so
far
in
his
getting
possession
of
what
are
entirely
personal
property,
personally
confidential
documents
and
property.
the
delay
is
not
over
yet.
unknown
speaker
historical
interest
never
will
be
given.
unknown
speaker
could
you
give
us
a
capsule
summary
of
the
difference
between
what
you
have
just
referred
to
as
nixon’s
personal
records
which
will
be
returned
and
the
matter
which
will
not
be
returned?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
dictabelt
was
paid
for
out
of
house
white
appropriations.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure
about
that
concession,
because
this
is
certainly
is
of
historical
interest.
unknown
speaker
is
this
concession
shared
by
the
solicitor
general,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
about
the
fact
that
the
paper
belongs
to
the
government
and
so
forth
that
we
do
not
believe
that
makes
a
document
a
government
document;
but
beyond
that,
if
the
court
does
--
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
dictabelts
representing
his
daily
diary?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
problem
right
this
very
minute
of
picking
those
up
and
giving
them
back
to
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
has
that
stymied
the
issuance
of
regulations,
mr.
solicitor
general?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
not
have
prevented,
would
it,
mr.
solicitor
general,
for
the
development
of
regulations,
the
proposal
and
publication
of
all
the
regulations
that
were
contemplated,
would
it,
unless
they
have
already
done
that
and
contemplate
no
other
regulations?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
are
not
any
104
regulations,
though,
are
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
what
the
present
status
is
of
the
preparation
of
regulations
for
104?
unknown
speaker
would
you
suggest
that
the
act
becomes
more
suspect
the
longer
it
goes
on
without
any
provision
whatsoever
for
implementing,
sorting
out
and
return?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that
is
what
you
keep
saying.
but
every
now
and
then,
you
say
that
the
congress
has
disapproved
the
regulations.
so
apparently,
the
litigation
did
not
hold
up
the
preparation
of
the
regulations.
what
has
held
it
up,
if
the
congress
had
not
disapproved
them,
they
would
long
since
has
been
issued.
how
could
the
litigation
have
held
them
up?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
will
ask
you
again.
suppose
that
goes
on
for
ten
years.
does
the
act
become
more
suspect
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
nothing
in
section
103
to
authorize
the
return
of
the
private
diaries
to
mr.
nixon.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
the
scheme
of
the
statute
is
that
before
any
private
material
is
returned,
some
third
party
must
read
the
material
to
be
sure
it
is
private.
unknown
speaker
mr.
herzstein,
can
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
vast
quantity
of
material?
some
of
that
material
was
watergate-related,
i
suppose,
and
that
was
that
material
which
was
most
likely
to
be
destroyed,
i
suppose,
if
we
were
to
read
the
congressional
material.
is
there
any
evidence
of
a
danger
of
destruction
of
anything
other
than
watergate-related
material?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
such
evidence
respecting
anything
except
material
related
to
watergate?
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
know
it
is
a
small
fragment
that
is
personal?
unknown
speaker
well,
his
claim
of
executive
privilege,
by
which
i
take
it
you
mean
his
separation-of-powers
claim,
basically
is
not
premised
at
all
upon
the
fact
that
these
are
personal
papers,
but
almost
the
opposite:
that
they
are
presidential
official
papers.
unknown
speaker
no,
not
necessarily
founder,
but
at
least
it
would
impair
the
protection
of
separation
of
powers
as
found
in
our
constitution.
unknown
speaker
do
you
share
the
view
that
congress
could
constitutionally
provide
that
on
the
termination
of
office
of
any
federal
judge
or
a
justice
that
all
of
his
papers
then
located
in
any
public
building
or
under
his
control
relating
to
his
tenure
of
office
could
be
impounded
until
the
archivists
had
decided
which
were
the
personal
items
and
which
were
those
relating
to
the
decision-making
process?
unknown
speaker
so
are
you
suggesting
that
we
limit
ourselves
to
the
briefs
when
we
reach
a
decision
on
the
case
and
the
record?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
these
oral
arguments
are
useless?
unknown
speaker
not
necessarily.
unknown
speaker
the
tape
recording
is
not
necessarily
part
of
any
public
record.
unknown
speaker
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
you
were
not
denigrating
the
oral
arguments.
unknown
speaker
by
the
way,
how
does
anybody
know
how
many
there
are?
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
come
from?
whose
estimate
is
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
have
you
made
any
effort
to
get
the
personal
papers
back?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
was,
did
you
ask
specifically,
not
all
the
documents,
but
that
the
personal
documents
be
given
to
him?
unknown
speaker
this
was
not
under
this
act,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
during
this,
have
you
ever
asked
since
this
act
was
passed?
have
you
ever
asked
that
the
personal
property
be
returned?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
doesn't
that
cut
into
your
argument
by
saying
that
all
of
this
has
involved
personal
property?
unknown
speaker
all
of
the
documents.
unknown
speaker
but
did
you
ever
specifically
say
you
want
the
dictabelts
back?
did
you
ever
say
that?
unknown
speaker
did
you
ever
say,
"we
want
the
personal
documents,
then
we
will
litigate
the
others"?
unknown
speaker
your
complaint
alleged
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
will
go
look
at
it.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
would
be
inconsistent
in
a
way
for
you
to
ask
for
anything
less
than
all
of
them,
because
one
of
your
constitutional
complaints
is
that
you
do
not
want
government
agents,
dozens
or
maybe
a
hundred,
rummaging
through
these
things.
that
is
one
of
your
constitutional
challenges.
unknown
speaker
to
decide
what
is
personal
or
what
is
not.
unknown
speaker
that
is
precisely
why
you
asked
for
your
own
man
to
go
in
there
and
pick
them
out?
unknown
speaker
do
you
believe
the
court
would
have
given
them
that,
despite
this
act?.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
do
not
think
the
court
could
enjoin
that
part
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
not
until
the
sorting-out
process
has
been
completed.
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
i
think
mr.
herzstein
suggested
that
of
the
42
million
total,
there
are
about
200,000
or
less
that
would
qualify
as
personal
documents.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
you
think
there
are
more
than
200,000?
unknown
speaker
in
the
category
of
the
dictabelts
and
other
personal
letters
and
things?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
the
record
suggest?
unknown
speaker
and
recorded
those,
also?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
if
it
suggests
anything,
the
records
shows
as
to
how
many
would
fall
into
what
you
would
define
as
personal
as
against
what
otherwise
would
be
official?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
do
the
42
million
include,
as
brother
rehnquist
suggested
earlier
…
what
about
papers
or
whatever
they
may
constitute
at
san
clemente
or
in
florida?
do
these
42
million
items
include
any
of
those,
or
are
we
talking
only
about
white
house?
unknown
speaker
well,
has
that
been
done?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suggest
that
the
42
million
are
only
white
house-originated
documents,
then.
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
before
you
sit
down,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
the
same
question
i
asked
your
opponent.
do
you
construe
the
legislative
history
as
being
tantamount
to
a
finding
that
mr.
nixon
was
an
unreliable
custodian?
