mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
first
time
in
the
200-year
history
of
our
republic
that
congress
has
seen
fit
to
enact
legislation
seizing
the
papers,
five-and-a-half
years
of
the
administration
of
a
former
president
of
the
united
states.
the
core
of
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
involves
tapes,
some
5,000
hours
of
tapes,
which
contain
conversations
by
the
former
president
which
deal
with
a
broad
spectrum.
they
range
from
political
discussions
to
discussion
with
his
aides
as
to
what
steps
and
decisions
should
be
made
by
the
presidency.
it
also
deals
with
matters
highly
personal,
such
as
conversations
with
his
wife,
conversations
with
his
daughter
immediately
prior
to
her
marriage
and
also
conversations
with
his
counsel,
with
his
physician
and
with
his
clergymen.
one
problem
with
this
case
in
realizing
the
impact
and
the
effect
of
the
legislation
is
that
involved
is
42
million
documents
as
an
estimate;
but
really,
the
core
of
this
case
are
the
tapes,
which
were
seized
by
section
101
of
the
act
in
question,
and
the
balance
of
the
presidential
material.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
section
101(a),
which
seizes
the
tape
recordings,
has
no
qualifying
language
which
indicates
that
the
seizure
is
directed
solely
to
presidential
material
or
the
like.
there
is
a
wholesale
seizure
of
those
tapes.
section
101(b)
talks
in
terms
of
seizing
all
of
the
balance
of
the
presidential
materials.
these
materials
which
represent
the
actions,
both
personal
and
private,
of
the
former
president
over
a
five-and-a-half-year
period
are
currently
in
the
control
of
the
united
states.
when
mr.
nixon
left
the
white
house,
he
left
directions
that
these
materials
were
to
be
forwarded
to
him.
this
direction
was
countermanded
at
the
request
of
the
special
prosecutor,
and
subsequently
the
legislation
in
question
was
enacted.
and
i
emphasize
that
this
legislation,
which
was
enacted
and
which
seized
the
tapes,
which
seized
all
other
presidential
materials,
was
enacted
in
haste
and
was
enacted
without
a
congressional
hearing.
the
impact
of
this
statute
on
the
former
president,
and
indeed
on
the
presidency
itself,
is
very
clear.
first,
under
section
102(d)
of
the
act,
access
is
given
to
any
agency
or
department
of
the
united
states
to
have
access
to
the
tape
recordings,
to
have
access
to
any
of
the
presidential
materials
of
the
former
president
for
any
lawful
government
purpose.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
subject
to
the
regulations
which
have
been
enacted
and
have
been
enforced
since
january
of
1975,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
regulations
which
have
been
adapted
permit
and
confirm
that
the
agencies
or
departments
of
the
united
states
do
have
access
to
these
tapes
for
any
lawful
government
purpose.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
believe
that
they
are
in
the
appendix,
if
the
court
please.
if
not,
i
can
supply
the
court
with
the
citation.
regulations
are
part
105-63
of
title
41,
code
of
federal
regulations.
the
additional
impact
of
this
statue
is
very
clear.
first
of
all,
it
directs
and
it
has
been
accomplished
a
seizure
of
five-and-one-half
years
of
a
man’s
entire
material,
whether
they
deal
with
the
actions
as
president,
whether
they
deal
with
his
actions
as
political
leader
of
his
party
or
whether
they
deal
with
actions
as
a
father
and
as
a
husband.
these
records
have
been
seized,
and
they
have
stayed
seized
ever
since
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
nixon
has
not
had
access
to
these
records
except
as
he
has
sent
someone
3,000
miles
to
his
home
to
have
access
to
these
particular
records.
the
purpose,
if
the
court
please,
of
section
104
of
the
presidential
materials
act
is
that
these
documents
or
specified
portions
thereon
will
be
made
public.
that
is
what
congress
enacted,
that
is
what
congress
intended,
and
that
is
subject
only
to
the
adoption
of
regulations
by
the
administrator
of
general
services,
which
must
be
approved,
or
can
be
disapproved,
if
i
may
correct
myself,
by
one
house
of
the
congress.
those
regulations
are
not
in
effect,
one
of
the
reasons
being
that
they
have
been
proposed,
that
they
have
been
disapproved,
they
have
been
withdrawn.
and
if
the
court
please,
the
status
of
those
regulations
is
in
a
very
confused
state
at
the
moment;
but
the
ultimate
purpose,
in
addition
to
seizing
these
records,
was
that
those
certain
matters
in
those
records
would
be
extracted
by
the
united
states
and
be
made
public.
the
most
intrusive
part
of
the
statute
in
question
is
that
it
has
authorized
the
archivist
of
the
united
states,
some
hundreds
is
what
the
plans
are,
to
go
through
all
of
these
records
word
by
word,
all
of
the
tape
recordings,
whether
they
involve
conversations
with
his
wife,
with
his
daughter,
whether
they
involve
conversations
dealing
with
his
political
decisions,
whether
they
involve
decisions
dealing
with
foreign
affairs,
whether
they
involve
his
decisions
with
respect
to
domestic
matters.
it
is
a
wholesale
and
grand
search
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
that
is
the
immediate
impact
of
this
statute.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
vests
in
a
president
of
the
united
states
the
executive
power
of
the
united
states.
it
is
that
executive
power
which
this
act
impacts
directly,
because
it
permits
access
to,
review
of
and
ultimately
publication
of
matters
which
are
totally
privileged
and
presumptively
privileged
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
nixon.
without
the
confidentiality
that
a
president
of
the
united
states
has
and
expects
and
has
expected
for
over
200
years
until
this
legislation,
this
court
has
ruled
that
the
president
and
his
aides
cannot
receive
the
plain,
unvarnished
and
candid
advice
that
he
has
the
right
to
expect
to
receive
and
must
receive
for
the
proper
operation
of
the
presidency
of
the
united
states.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
know
of
no
reason
to
expect
that
to
happen
except
that
as
a
second
half
of
the
statute
in
question,
a
presidential
or
a
governmental
materials
commission
has
been
formed
and
is
about
to
render
a
report,
in
which
they
will
make
recommendations
as
to
whether
congress
should
enact
legislation
which
deals
with
the
records
and
materials
of
future
presidencies
and
also
with
the
third
branch,
the
judiciary.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
would
be
time
enough
as
to
the
impact
on
existing
presidencies;
but
this
act
has
an
impact
on
the
operation
of
the
presidency
already,
because
people
in
the
white
house,
whether
it
be
the
white
house
of
president
ford
or
president
carter,
recognized
that
it
is
possible
if
this
law
is
sustained
on
a
constitutional
basis
that
the
statute
will
be
enacted
which
will
deprive
them
of
their
private
papers
and
the
papers
of
their
presidency,
because
if
you
can
do
it
in
one
instance,
there
is
no
reason
why
you
cannot
do
it
in
another.
if
the
separation-of-powers
principle
permits
congress
to
enact
legislation
seizing
every
scrap
of
material
for
five-and-a
half
years
or
six
months
or
three
months,
as
the
case
is
now,
of
the
operations
of
a
president
of
the
united
states,
i
say
that
that
act
is
totally
unconstitutional.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
say
that
there
is.
the
act
does
not
apply
to
any
administrations
except
that
of
former
president
nixon.
i
say
that
the
principle
is
a
restraining
effect
on
successive
presidencies,
because
when
those
presidents
are
conferring
with
their
aides,
they
are
doing
so
with
the
understanding
that
possibly
all
of
those
deliberations
and
conversations
may
be
made
public
by
subsequent
legislative
acts.
so
i
say
there
is
an
immediate
impact.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
i
understand
your
question,
the
legislation
would
simply
say
that
the
records
would
never
be
made
public?
i
would
say
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
do
not,
absolutely
not;
a
substantial
portion.
the
question
of
these
records
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
would
satisfy
the
separation
of
powers
to
this
extent:
it
would
stop
the
intrusion
by
archivists
and
others
into
these
papers,
because
as
privileged,
they
could
not
be
reviewed
by
third
parties.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
somebody
has
to
review
them
or
divide
them,
that
is
one
of
the
very
issues
that
goes
to
the
basis
of
the
fourth
amendment
argument,
if
the
court
please.
but
let's
assume
arguendo
that
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
the
former
president
can
determine
which
are
privileged.
this
court
has
already
decided
it
would
determine
what
are
privileged
occasions
and
has
so
decided.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
nothing
will
prevent
the
former
president
from
doing
that.
he
is
given
a
right
of
access
from
3,000
miles
away,
if
he
desires
to
come
here
to
review
them.
the
thing
that
would
prevent
him
from
reviewing
and
determining
all
of
them
would
be
the
substantial
burden
involved,
because
it
does
represent
five-and-a-half
years
of
the
presidency
of
the
united
states.
but
if
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
past
in
terms
of
the
concept
of
separation
of
power,
the
deliberation
of
each
branch,
whether
it
be
the
judiciary,
whether
it
be
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
whether
it
be
the
presidency
of
the
united
states,
the
deliberations
of
each
branch
are
for
and
within
the
sole
domain
and
the
determinations
of
each
of
those
branches,
the
reason
being
stated
very
simply
that
if
one
branch
of
government
can
intervene
into
the
deliberative
process
of
the
other,
then
truly
there
has
been
an
interference
and
a
breach
of
the
concept
of
separation
of
power,
because
the
ultimate
decision
and
how
you
make
decisions
is
solely
within
the
discretion
and
the
determination
of
each
of
the
branches.
congress
cannot
pass
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
say
this.
if
the
documents
subpoenaed
were
documents
which
dealt
with
or
tape
recordings
which
revealed
the
decision-making
process,
the
conferences
that
were
had,
the
positions
put
forth
by
the
aide
to
the
president,
that
those
documents
are
presumptively
privileged.
and
in
fact,
you
may
recall
that
the
senate
of
the
united
states
or
a
committee
thereof
did,
in
fact,
attempt
to
subpoena
several
of
the
tape
recordings,
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
held
that
no
sufficient
showing
had
been
made
to
breach
the
presumptive
privilege.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
has,
if
the
court
please,
been
a
long
history
and
tradition.
the
first
instance
that
i
know
of
where
the
president
of
the
united
states
refused
to
grant
information
requested
by
the
congress
was
george
washington.
congress
strongly
requested
that
he
supply
information
as
to
what
his
presidential
instructions
were
to
the
advisors
that
were
in
the
process
of
negotiating
the
jay
treaty.
president
washington
refused
to
do
so.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
absolutely,
if
the
court
please,
absolutely.
the
deliberative
process
cannot
be
invaded
by
one
branch
by
either
of
the
other
two.
that
has
to
be
an
established
basis
of
the
entire
concept
of
the
separation
of
power,
because
if
you
can
invade
the
deliberative
process,
you
can
control
its
result.
the
reason
it
is
important,
particularly
in
terms
of
the
presidency,
it
is
very
difficult
to
understand
how
the
office
of
the
president
works.
it
is
not,
as
most
people
assume,
an
office
of
record.
all
of
the
presidential
final
decisions
upon
which
this
court
will
act,
upon
which
congressional
action
can
be
taken,
are
filed
in
various
departments.
treaties
are
filed
with
the
state
department.
pardons
are
filed
with
the
department
of
justice.
you
go
through
the
various
presidential
decisions,
and
those
become
a
part
of
the
permanent
files
of
the
various
department
of
government
which
is
involved
in
the
decisions.
the
presidential
office
is
not
an
office
of
record.
it
is
an
office
whereby
it
is
determined
how
a
decision
is
to
be
made,
and
then
those
decisions
are
forwarded
on.
a
second
broad
reason
or
attack
on
this
statute,
and
one
which
i
do
not
think
there
can
be
any
justifiable
defense
to,
and
that
is
that
this
congressional
action
is
as
clear
and
is
as
grand
and
as
wholesale
a
violation
of
the
protected
privacy
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states
as
can
be
envisioned.
to
enact
legislation,
as
congress
has
done,
which
directs
that
five-and-a-half
years
of
a
man’s
paper,
personal
and
private,
as
well
as
presidential,
be
seized
by
a
government
agent
or
government
agency;
that
those
records
be
made
available
forthwith
to
any
agency
or
department
of
the
federal
government;
that
they
be
made
available
immediately,
subject
to
any
rights
or
privileges,
which
may
be
raised
for
judicial
subpoena;
and
that
while
over
100
archivists,
accompanied
by
lawyers,
technicians
and
secretaries,
will
have
a
right
to
review
word
by
word
five-and-one-half
years
of
a
man’s
life
is
to
me
absolutely
clear,
as
clear
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
one
can
imagine.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
distinction
with
respect
to
mr.
nixon’s
personal
papers
does
not
exist.
his
personal
papers
are
as
personal
to
him
as
mine
are
to
me.
and
i
say
that
the
congress
does
not
have
a
right
to
enact
legislation
directing
the
head
of
gsa
to
take
five
years,
or
indeed
six
months,
of
my
personal
records,
and
they
had
no
such
right
with
respect
to
the
personal
records
of
the
former
president.
the
cases
of
this
court
which
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
under
section
102(d)
of
the
act,
any
agency
or
department
of
the
federal
government
has
the
right
to
immediate
access
to
any
parts
of
these
papers,
be
they
the
tape
recordings,
be
they
presidential
papers.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
only
caveat
is
that
the
intrusion
must
be
for
lawful
government
use.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
cannot
be,
if
the
court
please.
it
absolutely
cannot
be,
and
yet
this
is
what
the
statute
directs,
that
these
personal
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
well,
it
is
subject
to
the
regulations
to
be
enacted
by
section
103.
if
the
court
please,
those
regulations
have
been
adopted
and
were
adopted
in
january
of
1975.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
assumed
that
they
were,
but
perhaps
they
are
not.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
they
were
not,
no.
the
ones
rejected
by
congress
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
oh,
they
are,
absolutely.
the
regulations
rejected
by
congress
were
pursuant
to
section
104(a)
of
the
act,
which
required
that
the
administrator
adopt
regulations
to
make
public.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
they
have
has
sections
permitting
…
what
these
regulations
do
is,
they
track
the
exact
language
of
the
statute,
and
they
give
access
to
any
agency
or
department
of
the
united
states
to
have
access
to
these
records.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
under
the
regulations
in
the
federal
register
promulgated
pursuant
to
section
103,
any
archival
intrusion,
i.e.,
any
time
an
archivist
goes
in,
there
is
a
provision
that
the
counsel
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
--
in
this
instance,
president
carter
--
will
be
notified
and
given
the
right
to
review
what
happens,
and
notice
is
given
to
the
former
president.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
he
would
have
notice
under
section
103
of
the
regulations,
yes.
and
whether
he
would
be
given
notice
under
the
regulations
ultimately
to
be
adopted
under
section
104,
we
would
have
to
wait
for
those
regulations.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
none
whatsoever.
in
fact,
with
respect
to
archival
intrusion,
if
these
hundred
archivists
with
lawyers
and
what-have-you,
go
through
these
personal
tape
recordings
and
other
conversations
without
a
warrant,
making
a
cert,
they
have
an
obligation
to
turn
over
to
the
department
of
justice,
if
they
find
anything
that
might
warrant
further
investigations
on
the
way;
so
that
this
is,
in
truth,
an
absolute
truth,
a
cert
followed
by
a
seizure,
which
i
strongly
submit
is
totally
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
are
general
regulations
adopted
which
apply
to
members
and
employees
of
the
general
services
administration,
if
the
court
please,
and
those
regulations
generally
forbid
making
available
to
the
public.
there
are
also
standard
statutes
in
the
title
xviii,
which
prohibits
government
officers
from
making
available
certain
types
of
information.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
in
those
there
would
be,
but
not
on
the
gsa
regulations,
which
have
broad
applicability
here.
at
this
time,
if
the
court
please,
mr.
lewin
will
present
the
balance
today.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes;
in
fact,
there
has
been
no
issue
raised
yet,
because
the
administrator
of
gsa
has
not
undertaken
the
reasonable
efforts
required
of
him
by
section
102
to
reach
out
and
take
those
records.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
not
as
to
documents
in
mr.
nixon’s
possession;
but
if
they
are,
then
they
are
going
to
reach
the
dictabelt
and
his
oral
diaries
that
he
dictated
at
the
end
of
every
day,
most
of
which
are
also
a
part
of
the
tape
recordings
i
had
mentioned,
because
when
he
dictated
his
diary
at
the
end
of
the
day
as
to
what
transpired,
how
his
day
went,
his
most
personal
thoughts,
those,
too,
become
a
part
of
the
tape
recordings
that
i
mentioned
here,
as
well
as
being
on
the
dictabelt.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
has
been
no
record,
because
in
effect
there
has
been
a
stay
of
any
action
up
to
this
date.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
would
like
address
myself
to
try
to
clear
one
factor
up
before
we
go
any
further.
of
42
million
papers
which
may
be
involved
in
the
presidential
material
…
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
it
is
an
estimate,
if
the
court
please.
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
a
…
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
believe
probably
the
gsa
made
the
estimate,
if
the
court
please;
but
i
am
not
really,
really
certain
about
that.
but
my
point
is,
you
cannot
ignore
the
vast
substantial
quantity
of
personal
and
private
conversations
and
records
in
this
case,
because
overall
there
may
be
42
million
documents.
we
are
talking
about
five-and-one-half
years
of
a
man’s
private
life.
so
you
cannot
ignore
and
say
there
is
nothing
involved
so
far
as
the
person
is
concerned,
because
they
may
only
be
5%
or
10%
of
the
large
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
we
have
filed
a
lawsuit,
which
is
not
this
lawsuit,
before
judge
richey,
requesting
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
comply
with
the
obligation
that
it
entered
into
by
contract,
whereby
all
of
these
documents
would
be
shipped
to
a
government
installation
in
california
not
far
from
mr.
nixon’s
home;
that
they
would
be
placed
under
strict
safeguards
pursuant
to
the
contract;
that
there
would
be
two
keys
for
access
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
do
not
recall
if
that
was
specifically
covered,
but
i
do
recall
in
oral
argument
before
judge
richey
pointing
out
that
the
personal
documents
were
not
being
turned
over
and
pointing
out
how
unfair
this
was.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
have
never
specifically
asked
that
the
personal
property
be
returned,
but
i
have
asked
--
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
when
we
filed
a
complaint
in
this
case
on
december
20th,
the
day
after
the
act
went
into
effect,
we
challenged
the
constitutionality,
and
as
a
part
of
that
complaint
we
requested
that
the
documents
be
returned.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
it
would
include
the
property.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
do
not
recall
specifically
asking
for
the
dictabelts
back.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
as
a
part
of
the
return
of
the
documents,
all
of
the
documents,
yes,
specifically,
the
complaints
did
ask
for
the
return
of
the
personal
documents.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
believe
you
will
find
that
in
the
complaint
that
was
filed
december
20th.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is
precisely
right.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
reason
is
is
because
the
statute
prohibited
it.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no.
no,
it
cannot.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no.
and
furthermore,
if
the
court
please,
with
respect
to
the
tape
recordings
themselves,
we
have
to
remember
that
there
are
two
provisions
of
this
particular
statute:
101(a),
which
applies
directly
to
the
tape
recordings,
and
that
is
a
severable,
distinct
and
separate
section
from
section
101(b),
which
seizes
all
of
the
other
material.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
that
is
what
mr.
herzstein
said.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
i
think
there
are
more
than
200,000.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
record
shows
that
when
mr.
nixon
was
asked
during
his
deposition
how
many
documents
he
had
seen
in
the
course
of
his
function
as
president
of
the
united
states,
he
finally
estimated
approximately
200,000.
the
record
further
shows
…
but
that
has
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
tapes,
which
are
5,000
hours
of
conversation,
and
the
evidence
and
the
record
show
that
he
talked
to
his
wife
or
his
daughter
one
or
maybe
several
times
a
day.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
and
that
these
were
recorded;
that
he
had
discussions
with
his
lawyers,
with
his
friends;
he
discussed
political
matters
as
the
head
of
the
political
party.
all
of
these
political
personal
matters
are
on
these
tapes,
and
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
statute
that
these
tapes
are,
quote,
“presidential
material”.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
there
is
no
way
to
make
a
proper
estimate
of
the
number
of
papers
that
are
personal.
you
take
the
record,
which
shows
that
mr.
nixon
resided
in
the
white
house
for
five-and-a-half
years;
that
there
are
some
800
reels
of
tape
that
covered
not
only
the
oval
office,
the
eob
office,
but
also
the
telephone
in
the
residential
part
of
the
white
house.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
the
42
million,
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
include
those
or
not.
the
statute,
as
the
court
will
recall,
empowers
the
administrator
of
general
services
to
take
steps
to
retrieve
any
presidential
materials
which
are
not
at
the
white
house,
which
include
those
of
san
clemente.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
no,
it
has
not,
because
the
implementation
of
the
statute
was
in
effect
staved
when
we
filed
our
lawsuit.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
white
house,
and
frankly
maybe
20
million
of
those
are
government
publications,
anniversary
greetings,
birthday
greetings.
i
mean,
they
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
this
lawsuit.
but
we
are
talking
here
the
guts
of
this
lawsuit
are
the
tapes
and
the
presidential
discussions
and
decision-making
process
and
the
political
aspect
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
for
a
five-and-a-half-year
period.
i
mean,
this
42
million
papers
is
nothing,
is
make-believe.
it
has
no
bearing
on
this
case
whatsoever.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
man’s
life
for
five-and-a-half
years,
acting
as
president
of
the
united
states,
meeting
with
his
associates
and
his
subordinates,
obtaining
advice
from
them,
meeting
with
foreign
officials,
determining
the
conduct
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states,
talking
with
his
wife,
talking
with
his
daughter
the
day
before
she
was
married,
and
what
discussions
were
recorded.
but
these
are
the
sum
and
substance
of
what
we
talking
about.
it
is
not
42
million
documents.
that
is
a
figure
that
should
not
even
be
as
a
part
of
a
record
in
terms
of
what
the
gut
issues
of
this
case
are,
because
we
are
talking
about
a
gross
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
will
take
effect
forthwith,
because
the
section
102(b)
gives
access
to
agencies
or
departments
of
the
united
states;
they
can
review
these
records.
and
let
me
disabuse
the
court
if
i
may
of
one
thing,
and
that
is
the
commingling
argument.
those
records
were
commingled,
because
for
200
years
the
presidents
of
the
united
states
had
a
right
to
expect
the
right
to
control
in
the
privacy
of
their
papers.
mr.
herbert
j.
miller,
jr.
listening
to
the
argument
of
my
esteemed
opponent,
that
is
the
only
basis
upon
which
you
can
justify
the
legislation
that
there
was
such
a
finding
and
that
such
a
finding,
existing
as
it
does,
turns
this
act
into
a
bill
of
attainder.
that
is
our
argument.
