mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
you
know,
we
are
appearing
on
behalf
of
distinguished
national
organizations
of
historians,
political
scientists,
reporters
and
various
prominent
members
thereof,
also
a
separate
group
of
interveners,
the
committee
for
public
justice,
and
prominent
members
thereof,
and
a
separate
group
for
reporter
jack
anderson.
the
national
organizations
include
the
american
historical
association
and
the
american
political
science
association.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
thing
very
clear,
and
that
is
that
there
has
been
no
question
in
this
case
raised
by
any
of
the
interveners
or
the
government
concerning
mr.
nixon’s
entitlement
to
the
return
of
his
personal
materials.
this
includes
diaries;
it
includes
conversations
with
his
family;
any
personal
property
of
any
kind
not
involving
the
actual
transaction
of
government
business.
no
issue
of
this
sort
was
raised
in
the
previous
case
before
this
statute
was
adopted.
the
groups
i
represented
brought
suit
against
the
administrator
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
nixon-sampson
agreement.
in
the
very
initial
complaint
that
was
filed
in
that
case,
it
was
made
clear
that
all
parties
acknowledged
the
personal
records
should
go
back
to
mr.
nixon.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
may
i
address
first
the
question
of
delay.
i
think
that
has
been
very
regrettable
for
us,
also,
your
honor.
there
has
also
been
a
delay
in,
of
course,
getting
access
to
the
governmental
materials
that
might
otherwise
have
been
made
available
for
public
access
under
normal
circumstances;
for
instance,
if
these
were
treated
as
other
government
materials.
the
delay,
i
think,
has
been
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
other
litigation
was
well
along
and
actually
resulted
into
a
decision
by
judge
richey,
but
that
was
stayed
in
favor
of
the
litigation
concerning
this
statute.
so
it
is
simply
one
of
the
costs
of
litigation,
which
we
regret,
too.
but
there
is
just
no
question
about
the
return
of
personal
diaries,
dictabelts,
so
long
as
they
are
not
the
materials
involved
in
the
transaction
of
government
business.
now,
the
statute,
i
agree,
could
have
been
drafted
a
little
more
clearly;
but
we
think
there
are
several
points
which
make
it
quite
clear
that
his
personal
materials
are
to
be
returned
to
him.
one
is
the
fact
that
statute
refers
to
the
presidential
historical
materials
of
richard
nixon,
not
to
the
personal
or
private
materials.
the
second
is
that
as
judge
mccree
mentioned,
criterion
7
calls
for
a
return
of
materials
to
him.
and
if
you
read
those
two
in
conjunction
with
the
legislative
history,
there
are
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
in
committee
reports
indicating
the
expectation
that
nixon’s
personal
records
would
be
returned
to
him.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
well,
yes.
certainly
any
personal
letters
among
his
family
or
friends,
certainly
a
diary
made
at
the
end
of
the
day
as
it
were
after
the
event.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
that
is
right.
that
does
not
bother
us.
i
think
it
is
incidental
now
that
we
do
have
a
different
view
on
the
tapes,
which
actually
recorded
the
transaction
of
government
business
by
government
employees
on
government
time
and
so
on,
the
normal
tapes
that
we
have
all
heard
so
much
about.
the
dictabelts,
mr.
nixon
has
said,
are
his
personal
diary;
instead
of
writing
it
down,
in
other
words,
he
dictated
it
at
the
end
of
the
day.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
that
is
right,
it
is;
but
we
do
not
feel
it
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
we
have
acknowledged
that
from
the
start.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
may
i
say
also
on
that
point
that
we
do
not
understand
the
regulations
to
be
here
under
attack,
including
the
section
103
regulations.
mr.
nixon
has
not
made
any
audible
complaint
as
far
as
we
have
known
about
the
fact
that
those
regulations
should
have
been
redrafted.
he
had
an
opportunity,
i
think,
to
litigate
those,
has
had
an
opportunity
and
still
does
to
litigate
those
section
103
regulations.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
no,
no.
but
the
103
regulations
are
the
ones
which
pertain
to
mr.
nixon’s
continuing
access,
which
he
is
allowed
to
do
right
now.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
well,
it
is
a
very
long
story.
i
believe
they
have
been
submitted
to
congress
on
two
occasions,
and
certain
portions
were
objected
to
the
first
time.
they
came
back,
a
certain
smaller
portion
was
objected
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
frankly,
your
honor,
i
think
the
implementation
of
the
regulations
has
been
held
up
or
at
least
has
gone
slower
because
this
litigation
is
pending.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
all
i
meant
to
say
is
that
i
am
speculating
that
the
general
services
administrator
has
been
abiding
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
of
course
it
does,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
no
except
there
is
a
problem
of
sorting.
mr.
nixon
has
objected
to
the
administrator
going
through
and
sorting,
even,
anything,
and
the
courts
at
his
request
have
enjoined
any
archival
sorting
of
these
materials
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
that
is
right,
that
is
the
problem.
since
mr.
nixon
has
not
gone
in
and
said,
“look,
please
sort
out
my
dictabelts
and
my
personal
diaries
and
so
on
and
return
them
to
me.”
he
has
gone
in
and
said,
“no,
no
one
may
see
those
things,”
and
he
has
asked
the
court
to
enjoin
that
and
we
have
not
objected,
no
one
has
objected.
in
other
words,
there
has
been
a
freeze
on
things
at
mr.
nixon’s
request
pending
this
litigation.
now,
as
i
say,
there
is
not
really
a
dispute
about
the
fact
that
mr.
nixon
should
have
back
his
personal
papers.
the
fact
is,
the
dispute
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
personal
records
are
a
tiny
fragment
of
this
vast
archive,
which
includes
many
papers
of
great
public
importance,
importance
both
to
the
continuing
needs
of
the
government,
which
is
documented
in
the
record
quite
amply
and
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
and
the
needs
of
--
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
there
is
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
i
would
have
to
check
through
the
legislative
history
on
that
and
see.
i
think
there
certainly
is
evidence
of
a
lack
of
confidence
that
the
de
facto
practice
that
has
existed
in
the
case
of
past
presidents
perhaps
might
not
work
so
well
this
time.
i
think
that
appears
amply
--
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
there
has
been
a
need
for
access
to,
i
think,
some
25
boxes
of
the
material
since
mr.
nixon
left
office
for
national-security
purposes.
that
came
out
at
a
deposition
of
the
secretary
of
the
national
security
council.
in
other
words,
the
ford
administration
has
had
to
go
in
there
and
use
some
of
these
things.
now,
whether
they
would
have
been
able
to
do
it
as
well
or
as
readily
if
they
were
in
mr.
nixon’s
possession
is,
of
course,
hard
to
say.
there
is
also
evidence
in
the
record,
however,
of
difficulties
in
past
administrations
giving
access
to
national-security
material
of
prior
administrations.
and
i
think
this
is
quite
apart
from
watergate.
there
was
a
justification
for
congress
to
say,
“look,
the
presidency
is
important
nowadays.
it
generates
vast
amounts
of
material
which
the
president
never
sees
which
are
needed
for
the
government.
it
is
time
that
we
continue
this
evolution
that
has
been
going
on
since
the
days
of
hoover,
presidential
libraries
and
so
on.
it
is
time
we
continue
this
and
set
up
an
orderly
regime,
which
takes
these
materials
and
puts
them
into
government
custody.
we
think
that
there
is
no
problem
about
the
power
of
congress
to
do
that.
the
only
problem
in
this
case
is
caused
by
the
intermingling
that
occurred
with
some
of
mr.
nixon’s
records
during
his
administration.
and
the
problems
mr.
nixon
is
raising
concerning
executive
privilege
and
concerning
privacy
really
come
down
to
the
question
of
how
do
we
segregate
these
things,
protecting
the
interests
of
both
sides.
basically,
his
position
is,
because
a
small
fragment
of
my
materials
are
in
there,
i
should
be
able
to
take
the
whole
thing,
and
it
should
be
my
sole
judgment
what
is
personal
and
what
is
public.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
your
honor,
mr.
nixon
testified
that
out
of
the
42
million
in
his
deposition
in
this
case,
he
could
not
have
seen
possibly
more
200,000
during
his
administration,
and
of
course
most
of
those
200,000
that
he
saw
would
have
been
in
the
course
of
government
business;
so
that
that
means
only
a
small
fragment
of
that
would
be
personal.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
i
think
that
is
right,
basically
he
has
two
points.
as
to
the
privacy,
he
is
saying
they
are
personal;
as
to
the
executive
privilege,
he
is
saying,
“the
presidency
will
founder
unless
i
can
do
this.”
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
yes,
that
is
right.
i
think
that
basically
what
we
face
here
on
that
question,
separation
of
powers,
is
a
situation
in
which
the
incumbent
executive,
both
the
ford
administration
and
the
carter
administration,
are
satisfied
that
there
is
no
impairment
of
executive
powers.
congress
is
satisfied,
so
we
have
two
branches
of
the
government
entirely
satisfied
--
in
fact,
aiming
at
working
out
these
problems
of
continuity
of
government
in
a
certain
way.
mr.
nixon,
a
person
who
is
no
longer
in
the
government,
who
no
longer
is
subject
to
public
accountability,
is
seeking
the
assistance
of
this
court
to
intercede
with
the
executive
branch
and
tell
the
executive
branch
the
way
it
is
planning
on
handling
executive
branch
records
with
concurrence
of
congress
as
a
separation
of
powers.
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
to
do
what
mr.
nixon
is
requesting.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
we
believe,
your
honor
--
and
needless
to
say,
this
case
is
not
before
us,
but
we
have
given
attention
to
that;
we
addressed
it
in
our
brief
--
we
believe
that
there
is
quite
apart
from
the
segregation,
there
is
certainly
a
basis
for
distinguishing
judicial
records
from
executive
branch
records.
there
may
be
even
grave
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
say
that
the
unpublished
records
of
members
of
the
judicial
branch
are
subject
to
congressional
power.
the
reason
i
say
that,
without
meaning
to
show
any
lack
of
reverence
to
the
court
is
that
i
think,
frankly,
the
public
interest
in
having
access
to
the
unpublished
records
of
the
court
is
simply
not
nearly
as
great
as
that
relating
to
the
president.
the
president
is
part
of
a
political
process.
the
effectiveness
of
his
regime
and
the
legitimacy
of
what
he
does
depends
on
his
following
procedures
that
are
designed
to
maximize
public
information
about
what
he
is
doing.
the
court
is
insulated
from
the
political
process.
everything
the
court
does
is
on
the
public
record
already.
the
materials
that
it
can
use
in
reaching
its
decision
are
only
those
on
the
record,
and
the
decisions
it
reaches
are
on
the
record.
in
the
case
of
the
president,
because
he
is
a
part
of
a
political
process
and
because
of
his
vast
powers,
he
can
draw
on
any
information
he
wants.
it
is
not
on
the
public
record
when
he
uses
it,
and
many
of
the
decisions
he
makes
are
never
on
the
public
record.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
i
hope
that
is
not
a
contempt
of
court.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
well,
no.
this
is
part
of
the
public
record,
too,
i
assume.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
i
saw
some
recorders
here
this
morning.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
oh,
no;
but,
of
course,
the
public
is
attending.
mr.
robert
e.
herzstein
are
there
are
any
further
questions,
your
honor?
