justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case,
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
presents
the
question
of
facial
constitutionality
for
the
presidential
recordings
and
materials
preservation
act
of
1974.
that
act
directs
the
administrator
of
general
services
to
take
custody
of
some
42
million
presidential
papers
and
some
880
tape
recordings
of
the
appellant,
former
president
richard
m.
nixon
and
promulgate
regulations
that
first
provide
for
the
orderly
processing
and
screening
by
executive
branch
archivist
of
such
materials
and
returned
to
appellant
of
those
that
are
personal
and
private
in
nature,
and
second,
that
provide
the
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
public
access
may
eventually
be
had
to
those
materials
that
are
retained
subject
in
each
case
to
any
rights,
defenses
or
privileges
that
the
federal
government
or
any
person
including
appellant
may
invoke.
now,
it's
important
to
emphasize
the
timeframe
in
which
congress
enacted
this
act.
appellant
resigned
as
president
on
august
9,
1974,
two
weeks
after
the
house
judiciary
committee
had
voted
to
recommend
his
impeachment.
just
one
month
after
his
resignation
on
september
8,
1974,
today,
incidentally
that
president
ford
pardoned
the
appellant,
then
administrator
of
general
services,
arthur
f.
sampson
announced
that
he
had
signed
a
depository
agreement
with
appellant
providing
for
the
disposition
of
appellant's
presidential
papers
and
the
tape
recordings.
that
agreement
provided
for
the
deposited
materials
that
a
storage
faculty
near
appellant's
california
home,
access
to
which
was
limited
to
the
appellant
and
an
archivist
of
the
united
states.
appellant,
however,
reserves
the
right
to
withdraw
or
direct
the
destruction
of
any
of
the
materials
after
three
years
except
that
in
the
case
of
tape
recordings,
the
period
was
after
five
years.
but
the
agreement
further
provided
that
after
10
years
or
upon
appellant's
death,
whichever
first
occurred,
the
tapes
would
be
immediately
destroyed.
congress
passed
the
act
as
emergency
legislation
deemed
and
necessitated
by
the
extraordinary
events
that
led
to
the
resignation
and
pardon,
and
particularly
necessitated
by
the
possibility
of
the
destruction
of
the
tape
recordings
and
other
materials
pursuant
to
the
nixon-sampson
agreement.
the
bill,
which
became
this
law,
and
was
expressly
passed
to
abrogate
the
nixon-sampson
agreement,
was
introduced
by
13
senators
on
september
18,
only
10
days
after
the
pardon
and
the
announcement
of
the
agreement.
congress
passed
and
sent
the
bill
to
president
ford
on
december
9,
and
president
ford
signed
in
the
law
on
december
19.
the
very
next
day,
december
20th,
before
the
administrator
had
any
opportunity
to
prepare
the
regulations
required
for
administration
of
the
act,
regulations
incidentally
subject
to
veto
by
one
house
of
congress
insofar
as
they
governed
future
public
access
to
the
materials.
appellant
filed
this
suit
on
the
district
court,
challenging
the
act's
constitutionality
because
the
regulations
governing
public
access
were
not
yet
affected.
the
district
court
held
that
questions
going
to
the
possibility
of
future
public
release
under
regulations
yet
to
be
published
were
not
right
for
review.
accordingly,
the
district
court
rendered
review
to
appellant's
claims
as
they
were
pertinent
to
the
facial
validity
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
requiring
the
administrator
to
take
the
papers
and
tape
recordings
into
his
custody
for
screening
by
the
government
archivist.
we
too,
therefore,
similarly
limit
our
consideration
of
the
merits.
now,
the
constitutional
questions
to
be
decided
are
of
course
of
considerable
importance.
they
touch
the
relationship
between
two
of
the
three
coordinate
branches
of
the
national
government,
the
executive
and
the
legislative,
and
the
relationship
of
appellant
to
his
government
and
the
act
applies
in
terms
specifically
to
appellant
by
name.
thus,
the
questions
arise
in
a
context
unique
in
the
history
of
the
presidency
and
present
issues
that
the
court
has
had
no
occasion
heretofore
to
address.
there
are
other
laws
that
deal
more
generally
with
presidential
papers.
for
example,
the
public
documents
act
which
is
title
ii
of
this
very
same
law
contemplates
legislation
governing
the
papers
of
future
presidents.
it
establishes
the
national
study
commission
on
records
and
documents
of
federal
officials
to
study
and
recommend
appropriate
legislation
regarding
the
preservation
of
the
papers
of
future
presidents
indeed
of
all
federal
officials.
and
the
presidential
papers
of
all
former
presidents,
from
president
hoover
to
president
johnson
are
already
housed
and
functioning
presidential
libraries
subject
to
the
presidential
libraries
act.
in
the
context,
therefore,
the
focus
of
the
act
upon
appellant
alone
can
we
hold
to
be
fairly
and
rationally
understood.
for
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act,
only
appellant's
materials
demanded
immediate
congressional
attention.
in
short,
we
hold
that
appellant
constituted
a
legitimate
class
of
one,
thus,
providing
a
constitutional
basis
for
congress'
decision
to
proceed
with
this
batch
with
respect
to
his
materials
while
accepting
the
status
of
his
predecessor's
papers
and
ordering
the
further
consideration
of
generalized
standards
to
govern
the
papers
of
his
successors.
it's
in
this
light
that
appellant's
constitutional
claims
must
be
considered.
the
claims,
five
in
number
argue,
(1)
that
the
act
violates
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers
encroaching
upon
presidential
prerogative
to
control
internal
operations
of
the
office
of
the
president,
(2)
that
the
act
violates
the
presidential
privilege
of
confidentiality,
(3)
that
the
act
unconstitutionally
invades
appellant's
right
of
privacy,
(4)
that
the
act
significantly
interferes
with
or
chills,
appellant's
first
amendment
of
sociational
rights,
and
(5)
and
finally,
that
the
act
violates
the
bill
of
attainder
clause.
the
district
court
comprehensively
canvassed
all
these
claims
and
a
through
opinion
concluded
that
none
had
merit.
the
district
court,
therefore,
dismissed
the
complaint.
we
affirmed,
since
our
independent
examination
of
the
claims,
we
attest
also
to
the
conclusion
that
none
has
merit.
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
seven
parts,
each
joined
by
five
or
more
justices.
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
powell
have
filed
opinions
joining
various
but
not
always
the
same
parts
and
concurring
otherwise
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
stevens,
while
joining
the
court's
opinion
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
and
each
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
