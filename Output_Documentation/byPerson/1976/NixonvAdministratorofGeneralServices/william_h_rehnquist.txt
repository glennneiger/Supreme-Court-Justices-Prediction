justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suppose
you
had
a
congressional
committee
thinking
about
legislating
about
this
subject,
and
it
subpoenaed
some
of
these
papers.
do
you
think
those
objections
on
the
part
of
the
executive
branch,
even
assuming
it
was
an
incumbent
president,
would
just
be
uniformly
sustained?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
mccree,
do
you
think
this
case
would
stand
on
any
different
footing
if
a
congressional
statute
had
been
directed
at
presidential
papers
that
were
located
in
key
biscayne
rather
than
the
white
house,
where
presumably
the
government
did
not
own
the
building
they
were
located
in,
but
the
papers
might
be
of
the
same
general
caliber?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
seizure
has
taken
place,
for
want
of
a
better
…
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
take
it
from
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
that
congress
could
immediately
upon
the
retirement
of
chief
justice
warren
from
this
court
have
passed
a
statute
similar
sequestering
all
the
papers
that
he
had
in
this
building.
