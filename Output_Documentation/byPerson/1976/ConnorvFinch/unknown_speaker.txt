mr.
parker,
just
to
get
the
follow-up
on
justice
stewart’s
question,
avoid
dilution
as
compared
with
what?
unknown
speaker
would
you
tell
me
again
what
the
percentage
variations
were
in
the
october
8th
proposal?
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
you're
arguing
that
the
three-judge
court
plan
is
unconstitutional,
as
well
as
being
an
abuse
of
its
discretion
in
adopting
it.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
you
can
complain
about
that
only
because
of
the
accidental
residents.
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
did
not
--
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
were
evenly
dispersed
throughout
the
county,
you'll
have
a
tough
time
making
the
argument,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
and
what
cases
do
you
rely
on,
or
maybe
you
don't
rely
on
them.
what
cases
do
you
think
apply
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
representation
rather
than
just
the
voting?
you
think
gomillion
and
anything
besides
gomillion
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
i
understand
your
dilution
argument;
but
i'm
asking
you
where
it
came
from.
is
it
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
do
you
think,
chapman
v.
meier?
unknown
speaker
did
it
in
chapman?
was
it
expressly
under
the
fifteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
why
i'm
asking,
give
me
the
cases
that
talk
about
dilution
of
representation
as
a
fifteenth
amendment
violation.
unknown
speaker
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
didn't
mention
the
fifteenth,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
you
about
fifteenth
amendment
cases.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
--
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
--
unknown
speaker
i
know,
do
you
think
that
is
expressly
on
the
fifteenth,
too?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
i
am
talking
about
the
fifteenth
amendment
bill,
though.
did
it
say
under
the
fifteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
any
others?
unknown
speaker
before
you
leave
hinds
county,
are
you
supporting
the
department
of
justice
plan
as
to
hinds
county?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
one
merit
of
the
three-judge
court
plan
for
hinds
county
is
the
small
variance.
unknown
speaker
i
think
part
of
the
justice
plan
is
12%.
unknown
speaker
which
is
greater
than
the
three-judge
court’s
plan.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
two
percentage
points-plus.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
focus
again
for
me
why
you
suggest
with
some
emphasis
the
use
of
54%?
unknown
speaker
i
just
asked
the
question,
isn’t
the
answer
to
get
out
the
vote?
why
should
the
federal
courts
of
this
country
take
into
consideration
that
kind
of
a
feature
and
kick
it
up
to
54%
rather
than
50%?
unknown
speaker
can
you
say
the
same
thing,
make
the
same
argument
about
the
sexes?
i
think
there
are
patterns
between
the
masculine
and
feminine
sexes
and
who
votes
more,
and
yet...
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
before
you
sit
down,
there
seems
to
be
some
difference
in
the
variance
figures
employed
by
the
three-judge
court
and
in
those
that
you
propose
in
your
briefs
here.
on
which
are
we
to
rely?
unknown
speaker
normally,
that
is
something
for
the
district
court
and
not
for
us
to
work
out.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
support
the
private
parties'
claims
with
respect
to
the
house
districts
in
adams
county?
unknown
speaker
is
that
biloxi
down
there?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
those
are
called
beats,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what's
that
word
come
from?
unknown
speaker
b-e-a-t.
unknown
speaker
right,
the
red
light
will
go
on.
