mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
has
taken
no
position
in
either
the
district
court
or
in
this
court
with
respect
to
the
controversy
about
the
adequacy
of
the
district
court’s
plan
under
the
one
person-one
vote
criteria.
we
have,
however,
taken
a
position
with
respect
to
dilution
of
black
voting
strength
and
with
respect
to
the
need
for
additional
special
elections
besides
those
required
for
two
house
districts
by
the
district
court.
in
neither
of
those
instances,
however,
have
we
found
it
necessary
to
reach
any
constitutional
question,
nor
do
we
see
any
reason
why
this
court
should
do
so.
we've
been
taking
our
law
from
chapman
v.
meier,
which
distinguishes
very
sharply
between
what
is
constitutionally
permissible
if
adopted
by
a
state
legislature
pursuant
to
state
policy
and
the
proper
remedial
criteria
to
be
used
by
a
district
court
in
the
absence
of
an
acceptable
state
plan
in
formulating
relief.
and
as
a
matter
of
the
proper
exercise
of
a
court’s
discretion,
as
an
equitable
matter,
we
believe
that
there
were
errors
here
in
the
court’s
plan,
which
we
have
specified.
but
before
getting
to
those
errors,
i
should
point
out
that
much
of
the
court’s
plan
is
acceptable,
and
after
a
course
of
very
long
litigation,
substantial
progress
was
made
with
the
formulation
of
this
plan.
this
litigation
began
in
1965.
our
own
participation
is
much
more
recent;
we
intervened
in
june
of
1975
in
the
district
court.
but
even
so,
i
think
that
some
of
the
contentions
before
this
court
by
the
state
parties
have
lost
sight
of
what
has
already
been
decided.
the
case
has
been
in
this
court
on
four
previous
occasions,
and
a
great
deal
have
been
decided.
for
example,
a
question
has
been
raised
about
the
propriety
of
the
district
court’s
adopting
a
plan
involving
all
single-member
districts.
well,
the
decisions
in
connor
v.
johnson
in
402
u.s.
and
the
next
connor
case
in
404
u.s.
said
that
the
district
court
was
to
favor
single-member
districting
in
the
court-ordered
plan.
this
is
what
has
become
known
as
the
connor
rule,
and
it's
late
in
the
day
not
just
as
a
matter
of
--
this
is
already
decided;
it's
late
in
the
day
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
for
the
state
now
to
be
arguing
that
because
of
mississippi’s
longstanding
policy
in
favor
of
multi-member
districting.
the
connor
rule
should
not
be
applied
in
the
case
in
which
it
originated
and
in
which
this
court’s
instructions
to
the
district
court
were
quite
clear.
if
that
question
should
be
reconsidered
at
all,
it's
improper
to
ask
that
it
be
reconsidered
in
this
case,
in
which
it's
the
law
of
the
case.
and
the
district
court
therefore
quite
properly
favored
a
single-member
district
plan
and
in
working
that
out
adhered
to
the
extent
that
it
could
to
the
state’s
longstanding
policy
of
trying
to
maintain
the
boundary
lines
of
the
counties,
the
beats,
the
precincts,
and
largely
succeeded
in
doing
so,
though
we
think
that
those
aspects
of
the
decision
are
really
behind
us
in
this
case,
and
the
question
is
whether
despite
the
criteria
that
the
court
said
it
was
utilizing
in
adopting
its
final
plan,
the
plan
fell
short
in
achieving
those
criteria.
we
don't
really
attack
the
guidelines
individually.
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
any
one
of
them
in
particular
as
an
appropriate
guideline
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
formulating
its
final
plan.
we
do,
however,
attack
the
criteria
that
the
district
court
used
in
refusing
to
order
additional
special
elections,
so
that
our
stance
is
a
little
different
with
respect
to
the
two
issues
in
that
way.
we
think
that
those
were
inherently
erroneous
reasons
for
refusing
to
order
special
elections.
we
don't
think
the
guidelines
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
formulating
its
final
plan
were
individually
inherently
erroneous.
although
we
may
quarrel
with
the
weight
given
one
as
against
another,
the
main
shortcomings
there
were
errors
of
omission
as
we
see
it,
the
failure
to
adequately
remedy
the
longstanding
use
of
apportionment
as
a
method
of
diluting
minority
voting
strength.
and
the
failure
to
recognize
the
importance
in
the
case
of
voting-age
population
rather
than
just
general
population
statistics,
which
differ
considerably
in
the
state
of
mississippi
from
the
realistic
measure
of
voting
strength
that
it's
all
we
realistically
talk
about
in
assessing
whether
there
is
an
opportunity
for
all
elements
of
the
community
to
participate
meaningfully
in
the
electoral
process.
but
the
principle
of
chapman
v.
meier
specifies
that
it
applies
to
multi-member
districting
and
to
population
deviations,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
same
principle
almost
necessarily
must
also
apply
to
remedying
a
pattern
of
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength,
such
as
has
been
shown
in
this
case,
in
which
we've
detailed
in
the
record
and
in
a
lengthy
appendix
to
our
brief
and
we've
shown
the
extent
to
which
these
problems
persist.
now,
i
want
to
address
briefly
the
question
of
maximization
against
dilution
as
it's
involved
in
this
case.
in
mississippi,
the
black
voting-age
population
constitutes
31.4%
of
the
population,
and
i
am
sorry
we
never
drew
these
figures
together
in
the
brief
in
discussing
the
dilution
question.
we
have
compiled
them
just
in
the
course
of
preparing
this
argument.
under
the
court
plan,
in
the
senate,
where
there
are
52
districts,
there
would
be
only
4,
or
7.7%,
as
against
the
31.4%,
which
would
have
what
we
think
the
record
shows
is
the
minimum-needed
54%
of
black
voting-age
population
in
order
for
the
black
electorate
to
have
a
working
majority.
we
have
cited
the
references
in
the
record
that
show
that
all
of
the
estimates
of
what's
needed
for
an
effective
working
majority
are
54%
and
on
up.
but
even
if
you
look
at
50%
black
voting-age
population,
there
would
be
9
districts,
17.3%,
as
against
the
total
of
31.4%.
under
the
alternative
plans
which
were
before
the
court
which
we
have
pointed
to
in
our
brief,
and
most
of
the
difference
between
the
plaintiffs
and
ourselves
arise
from
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
attempted
and
we
don't
say
that
this
was
improper
at
all
to
project
their
figures
from
the
1970
census
to
approximate
the
1975
population
distributions,
whereas
in
our
participation
we
limited
ourselves
to
the
1970
census
figures,
which
the
district
court
indicated
that
it
planned
to
follow.
under
the
alternatives
that
we've
proposed
for
the
senate,
the
number
of
districts
with
54%
or
more
black
voting-age
population
would
be
increased
from
4
to
6,
or
from
7.7%
to
11.5%,
and
those
50%
or
more
would
be
increased
from
9
to
11,
or
17.3%
to
21.2%,
still
well
under
the
31.4%,
which
can
be
used
as
a
starting
point
to
see
whether
unnecessary
fragmentation
of
black
voting
strength
constitutes
a
dilution
that
should
be
avoided
by
a
court
of
equity
undertaking
to
remedy
a
longstanding
pattern
of
discriminatory
dilution
of
black
voting
strength.
and
the
same
thing
can
be
said
of
the
house
figures.
there's
a
122-membership
figure
for
the
house.
there,
under
the
court’s
plan,
17
of
those
districts,
or
13.9%,
would
have
54%
or
more
black
voting-age
population,
and
24
of
the
districts,
or
19.7%,
would
have
50%
or
more
black
voting-age
population.
under
the
alternatives
that
we
point
to,
those
figures
would
be
increased
from
17
to
22
for
the
54%
figure,
which
would
get
18%
black
voting-age
population,
18%
of
the
districts,
or
in
the
50%
black
voting-age
population,
the
increased
would
be
from
24
to
27
districts,
or
22.1%
of
the
total
122
districts,
in
each
case
still
well
under
the
31.4%
of
the
total
population
that
is
accounted
for
by
the
blacks
of
voting
age.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
testimony
in
the
record
and
we
have
summarized
it
in
footnote
46,
page
53
of
our
brief
--
indicates
in
one
instance
an
estimate
of
58%,
in
the
other
an
estimate
of
54%
to
65%
as
the
percentage
needed
in
order
for
black
voters
to
have
an
effective
voting
majority.
there
is
other
evidence
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
blacks
are
registered
in
lower
proportion
than
whites.
so
if
you're
using
voting-age
population
statistics,
they
don't
really
reflect
the
strength
at
the
polls.
there
is
testimony
that
whereas
very
few
whites
who
are
registered
consistently
fail
to
vote,
about
10
to
15%
of
the
blacks
who
are
registered
have
never
voted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
ideally,
that
is
the
answer;
but
the
testimony
indicates
and
there
are
no
findings
to
the
contrary;
there
are
just
no
specific
findings
on
this
at
all
by
the
district
court
that
the
difficulties
with
getting
out
the
vote
are
to
a
large
extent
a
result
of
the
prior
pattern
of
discrimination;
that
many
of
the
older
blacks
are
afraid
of
economic
reprisals
if
they
vote.
that
there
has
been
a
long
history
of
intimidation
and
fear.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
wouldn't
make
any
such
argument
without
basing
it
on
testimony
in
the
record
and
evidence.
i
don't
think
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
can
be
hypothesized.
we
are
really
addressing
ourselves
with
the
54%
figure
to
very
specific
evidence
developed
in
the
course
of
this
long
trial
and
there
is
the
additional
distinction
that
there
hasn't
been
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitutional
amendment
entitling
women
to
vote
sex
state-imposed
discrimination
that
might
result
in
intimidation
of
women.
at
any
rate,
we
are
confining
ourselves
in
this
case
to
what
this
record
has
shown.
but
even
if
we
go
down
to
the
lower
figure
of
50%,
as
i
indicated,
we
would
still
be
well
under
the
31.4%
figure
if
the
remedies
that
we
have
proposed
were
adopted.
now,
i
just
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
kind
of
dilution
we
are
concerned
with.
one
example,
which
i
think
is
fairly
graphic,
is
to
be
seen
on
page
55(a)
of
our
brief,
one
of
these
pullouts.
this
one
happens
to
involve
warren
county.
the
point
has
been
made
before
this
court
that
you
can
have
the
same
kind
of
dilution
as
a
result
of
splitting
up
a
multi-member
district
so
that
each
single-member
district
has
the
same
basic
percentages
as
would
be
true
of
the
multi-member
district,
and
the
figures
under
the
court’s
plan
for
warren
county
provide
almost
a
classic
example
of
that,
where
there
is
almost
uniformity
in
the
three
districts
here
in
the
house
in
the
percentage
of
blacks
in
each
district.
in
each
case
as
a
percentage
of
total
population,
it
is
between
40%
and
45%.
the
black
voting-age
population
is
more
uniform,
in
each
case
between
39%
and
41%
and
under
our
alternative
plan,
the
alternative
plan
that
was
before
the
court
which
we
mention
there,
one
of
those
districts
could
be
drawn
in
actually
a
more
compact
way,
as
shown
by
the
maps
on
the
preceding
pages.
so
as
to
have
a
56.6%
black
voting-age
population,
whereas
the
other
two
would
be
majority
white,
and
here
in
a
district
in
which
the
black
voting-age
population
is
close
to
40%
instead
of
having
three
majority-white
districts,
one
of
the
three
would
be
a
majority-black
district.
that
is
the
kind
of
deficiency
that
we
have
found
in
the
plan.
i
just
want
to
say
one
more
word
about
a
complaint
that
the
state
has
made
on
page
40
of
its
reply
brief
in
footnote
32
that
somehow
the
difficulty
here
has
been
the
failure
of
the
attorney
general
to
apply
the
criteria
of
this
court’s
decision
in
beer
to
the
state’s
legislatively
adopted
plan.
the
court
decided
in
421
u.s.
in
one
of
the
previous
decisions
in
this
case
that
that
legislative
plan
would
have
no
legal
effect
until
and
unless
cleared
pursuant
to
section
5.
the
plan
was
then
submitted
to
the
attorney
general,
who
interposed
an
objection
on
june
10th,
1975,
many
months
before
beer
was
decided
by
this
court
on
march
30th,
1976.
of
course,
since
this
court’s
decision
in
beer,
we
use
the
criteria
enunciated
by
this
court;
but
at
the
time
this
objection
was
interposed,
the
district
court’s
decision
in
beer
was
the
authoritative
determination
of
the
meaning
of
the
voting
rights
act.
there
has
been
no
submission
by
the
state
since
that
time,
and
there
is
no
section
5
issue
in
this
case.
there
was
nothing
before
the
district
court
under
section
5;
it
would
have
had
to
be
before
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
we
are
reserving
the
remainder
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we've
had
great
difficulty
in
determining
how
the
court’s
figures
were
calculated.
we
have
done
some
re-examining
of
our
own
figures
and
have
explained
in
the
course
of
our
briefs
some
modifications,
simple
ones,
that
can
be
made
in
our
proposals,
and
we,
in
appendix
d
of
our
brief,
recounted
in
detail
exactly
how
our
figures
were
compiled.
and
i
can't
verify
anything
but
our
own
figures.
i
feel
that
they're
reliable
as
we
re-examined
them.
if
they
had
been
put
to
a
test
in
a
hearing
in
the
district
court,
i
think
some
of
the
refinements
that
we've
made
would
have
been
made
in
the
course
of
the
district
court
proceedings.
that
is
all
i
can
say
about
the
figures.
we
feel
that
we
have
presented
reliable
figures
here,
we
don't
know
what
the
district
court's
are.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
understand
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
them;
but
we
see
nothing
wrong
with
their
claims.
we
see
nothing
wrong
with
their
projections
to
the
1975
figures,
which
are
all
based
on
undisputed
testimony
and
a
study
made
by
a
state
university.
nothing
has
been
introduced
to
the
case
to
controvert
any
of
their
contentions.
