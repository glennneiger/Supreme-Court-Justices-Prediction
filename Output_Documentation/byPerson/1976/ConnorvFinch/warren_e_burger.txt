mr.

chief

i'm
frank
to
say,
i
don't
remember
it.

may
proceed.
chief

e.

very
well,

mr.
leonard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
let
me
put
this
hypothetical
question
to
you,
it
may
or
may
not
be
too
relevant.
suppose
hypothetically
the
state
of
mississippi
and
i
am
addressing
this
to
your
friend,
mr.
leonard.
could
be
reapportioned,
the
lines
drawn
irrespective
of
counties,
so
that
in
every
voting
district
the
voting
strength
would
be
a
reflection
of
the
total
population,
that
is
37-63.
would
that
meet
all
constitutional
standards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
any,
any
plan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn’t
that
be
the
acme
of
perfection,
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
certainly
dilute
some
of
the
voting
strength,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
the
court
now
ordered
proportionally
representation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
lay
aside
proportional
representation,
which
is
not
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wouldn’t
be
adequate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
were
prepared
to
concede
that
that
was
the
acme
of
perfection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
are
the
courts
going
to
reach
the
subjective
attitudes
of
the
voters,
either
negro
or
white,
in
terms
of
how
they
should
vote?
how
does
any
decree
of
any
court
reach
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
