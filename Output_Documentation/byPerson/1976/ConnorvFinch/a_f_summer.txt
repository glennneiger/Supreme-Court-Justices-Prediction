mr.
a.
f.
summer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
appeal
here
is
from
the
1979
court-ordered
single-member
plan
for
mississippi
and
for
two
special
elections
ordered
under
that
plan.
i
will
present
our
appeal
in
regard
to
the
fractionalization
of
county
lines
and
special
elections;
mr.
leonard,
associate
counsel,
will
present
our
argument
in
response
to
the
racial-dilution
argument
that
has
just
been
given.
i
might
say,
however,
in
the
beginning
that
i
am
quite
surprised.
i
have
been
in
this
case
for
seven
years
to
find
the
plaintiffs'
attorney
say
this
morning
that
they
had
not
progressed
from
the
one
man-one
vote
to
a
guaranteed
black
district.
that
comes
as
quite
a
surprise
to
me,
because
i
believe
a
good
portion
of
this
time
has
been
spent
developing
that
progress
in
each
case.
i
also
was
surprised
to
hear
the
government’s
attorney
say
that
we
had
been
foreclosed
in
making
our
argument
against
a
single-member
plan
that
was
ordered
by
this
court
for
the
first
time
in
1976,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
case
has
been
here,
this
does
make
the
fifth
time
that
the
case
has
been
before
this
court.
but
unfortunately,
it
has
never
been
here
on
the
merits.
we
have
never
had
the
opportunity
to
orally
argue
the
case,
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
it
has
been
here
on
the
merits
itself
and
we're
delighted
that
that
time
has
finally
come,
because
in
the
instance
where
this
court
first
spoke
to
the
lower
court
in
regard
to
its
1975
plan
and
we
do
advocate
the
acceptance
by
this
court
of
the
1975
plan
as
drawn
by
the
court.
we
feel
that
that,
then,
has
never
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
any
court.
in
fact,
the
things
that
were
spoken
to
here
this
morning
were
set
out
specifically
by
the
trial
court
in
reaching
all
of
the
objections
they
made
there
and
when
this
court
first
spoke
to
the
lower
court,
it
was
in
regard
to
hinds
county.
hinds
county
is
the
largest
county
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
we
have
82
counties
in
mississippi.
we
only
have
one
metropolitan
district.
we
are
not
a
large
state,
in
that
we
have
cities
like
chicago
or
detroit.
jackson,
mississippi
is
the
capitol;
it
has
approximately
200,000
people.
it
is
within
hinds
county
and
so
as
a
result,
hinds
county
is
entitled
under
the
1970
census
to
12
legislators.
this
court
sent
word
back
to
the
lower
court
that
the
plaintiffs
have
shown
us
that
within
three
days,
they
could
prepare
four.
if
i'm
not
mistaken
either
two
or
four,
different
plans
for
hinds
county
to
be
single-member
districted.
therefore,
district
court,
you
should
be
able
to
do
so,
and
we
stay
your
order
until
june
the
14th
of
1975
until
you
prepare
a
single-member
plan
for
hinds
county
absent
insurmountable
difficulties.
well,
when
we
held
the
first
hearing
back
in
jackson,
plaintiffs'
counsel
frankly
admitted
that
the
plans
that
he
had
submitted
to
this
court
were
based
on
erroneous
information,
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
those
plans
working
it
all.
the
court
appointed
a
master
and
found
that
there
were
insurmountable
possibilities,
because
the
census
was
taken
by
enumeration
districts
and
not
by
the
governmental
districts,
that
is,
the
county
and
the
beat
lines.
so
as
a
result
of
that,
it
was
impossible
within
that
short
period
of
time,
and
the
lower
court
so
notified
this
court.
then
the
next
time
when
it
came
up,
i
think
this
court,
having
seen
it
some
several
times,
sent
it
back
to
the
lower
court
and
said,
look,
you
have
prepared
a
plan.
you
have
kept
jurisdiction
of
hinds,
harrison
and
jackson
county.
harrison
and
jackson
county
are
on
the
mississippi
gulf
coast
and
next
to
the
most
populous
counties
in
the
state.
mr.
a.
f.
summer
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
that's
in
harrison
county.
mr.
a.
f.
summer
jackson
is
just
to
the
east
of
that.
you
gentleman
said,
fix
hinds,
harrison
and
jackson
county.
in
the
meantime,
we're
going
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
we're
going
to
vacate
the
judgment
so
that
when
you
fix
harrison
and
hinds
and
jackson
county,
we
can
get
the
whole
case
before
us
up
here,
and
that
was
your
order
to
them;
and
then
you
admonished
them,
of
course
that
the
lower
court
had
said
it
would
be
ideal
to
single-member
district
hinds
county.
you
agreed
with
that
and
said
to
the
effect
what
it
was
now
known
as
the
connor
rule
that
single-member
districts
are
preferable
if
multi-member
districts
can't
be
articulated.
so
here
we
were
with
a
rule
that
began
to
go
all
around
the
country
that
specifically
as
it
applied
to
us,
this
court
had
spoken
to
hinds,
harrison
and
jackson
county.
they
said,
you
single-member
district
hinds,
harrison
and
jackson
county
and
send
us
the
whole
plan
back.
then
we
will
decide
on
the
constitutionality
or
unconstitutionality
of
that
plan.
eventually
that
was
done,
and
i
say
"eventually"
because
there
are
implications
here
that
there
were
people
dragging
their
feet.
throughout
this
entire
period
of
time,
the
legislature
has
been
acting
and
acting
and
acting.
every
time
this
court
came
down
with
a
case,
they
would
pass
another
reapportionment
plan
trying
to
conform
with
it,
preventing
the
lower
court
down
there
from
going
forward,
because
you
also
said
it's
better
for
the
legislature
to
do
it.
so
the
court
said
if
the
legislature's
going
to
do
it,
we
are
going
to
let
them
do
it
and
then
as
soon
as
they
got
to
the
district
court,
of
course,
then
the
constitutional
challenge
was
made,
and
the
plans
that
were
referred
to
by
the
plaintiffs'
attorneys
here
were
plans
that
violated
a
longstanding
state
policy,
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
mahan
and
chapman,
of
never
breaking
or
fractionalizing
a
county
line,
since
it
has
been
a
state
of
this
union.
when
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1870,
the
congressional
acts
that
called
the
mississippi
constitution
together
provided
that
two
to
six
members
be
represented
from
each
county
in
that
constitutional
convention.
that
was
even
before
we
became
a
state.
in
the
constitution
of
1870,
there
were
provisions
for
multi-member
districts
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
in
the
constitution
of
1832,
there
were
provisions
for
multi-member
districts.
in
1869,
right
after
the
civil
war,
when
the
carpetbaggers
and
the
scalawags,
they
are
so-called,
all
joined
hands,
and
they
kept
the
multi-member
districts;
they
made
no
effort
to
change
them
whatsoever,
i
am
speaking
to
the
dilution
aspect,
the
racial-dilution
aspect.
then
in
1890,
it
was
not
changed.
so
for
150
years,
there
has
never
been
a
person
elected
to
the
mississippi
legislature
by
the
breaking
of
a
county
line.
we
have
82
counties
each
county
is
divided
into
five
supervisory
districts.
those
supervisory
districts
--
mr.
a.
f.
summer
yes,
sir.
they
are
called
beats
and
a
super
--
mr.
a.
f.
summer
when
it
was
old,
it
used
to
be
the
old
police
jury,
and
i
guess
they
got
the
beats
from
that
police
beat,
and
they
just
continued
that
on.
mr.
a.
f.
summer
b-e-a-t-s,
beats,
sir.
actually,
officially
it's
a
supervisory
district;
but
the
words
are
anonymous,
and
it's
referred
to
as
beats.
a
supervisor
is
elected
from
each
beat,
which
is
well-defined.
as
he
was
pointing
out
here
on
this
map,
there
has
been
litigation
in
hinds
county
going
on
now
for
a
considerable
period
of
time,
and
it
is
up
for
a
re-hearing
and
back
in
the
5th
circuit
court
of
appeals
now
and
of
course,
mr.
leonard
will
address
what
the
judge
had
to
say
in
regard
to
the
dilution
question
in
that.
so
there
are
410
beats,
but
the
5
supervisors
in
each
county
is
the
governing
body.
we
have
a
chancellor
clerk,
circuit
clerk,
sheriff
and
so
forth.
now,
the
main
thing
about
that
is
that
they
are
autonomous,
they
are
elected
by
the
people
of
those
counties,
and
of
course
they
are
answerable
to
nobody.
but
the
big
difference
is
that
they
act
in
only
administrative
capacities.
they
have
no
power
to
tax;
they
have
no
power
to
set
a
judge’s
salary,
for
instance,
as
the
federal
judge’s
salaries
are
set
by
congress,
i
guess;
for
the
entire
united
states,
everybody
gets
the
same.
that
is
not
true
in
mississippi.
that
legislator
from
that
county,
if
he
wants
his
judge
a
raise,
has
got
to
come
and
get
that
judge
a
raise.
there
are
as
many
different
salaries
for
county
judges
in
mississippi
as
there
are
county
judges.
the
same
thing
is
true
for
the
county
attorneys.
in
fact,
even
whether
or
not
a
county
will
have
a
county
attorney
must
be
decided
by
the
legislature.
so
if
you
fractionalize
a
county,
you
destroy
the
very
fabric
of
which
the
government
of
mississippi
is
made
up,
and
this
is
why
we
object
so
strongly
to
a
single-member
plan.
we
are
not
against
single-member
plans,
and
certainly
we're
not
promoting
multi-member
plans.
we
are
simply
saying
that
as
this
courts
spoke
to
the
issue
in
mahan
and
as
it
spoke
to
the
issue
in
chapman
and
other
cases,
that
you
spoke
specifically
to
the
fact
that
longstanding
state
policies
qualify
to
create
variances
that
would
not
be
acceptable
in
any
other
standard.
in
fact,
the
court
in
swann
spoke
to
the
fact
that
there
were
about
30%
or
35%
and
even
indicated
by
stating
in
that
case
and
it
was
a
court-drawn
plan
that
the
results
may
have
been
different
if
the
state
policy
had
been
articulated
by
the
judge
that
drew
it.
and
in
this
case,
in
the
1975
plan,
the
district
court
articulated
very
clearly
and
very
outstandingly
the
necessity
for
this
longstanding
policy
in
mississippi.
i
see
it
is
12:00
o’clock
if..
mr.
a.
f.
summer
oh,
i'm
sorry.
but
they
did
articulate.
they
took
the
test
that
was
laid
down
in
the
chavis
case.
they
took
the
test
in
white
v.
regester
case,
and
they
specifically
spoke
to
each
one
of
those
tests
insofar
as
dilution
is
concerned.
but
then
going
to
the
county
government
qualifying
as
a
rational.
mr.
a.
f.
summer
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
a.
f.
summer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
speaking
to
the
importance
of
the
county
government
as
a
unit
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
i
had
already
enumerated
a
few
of
the
most
important
facts;
and
i
would
like
to
add
a
few
more
to
that,
because
the
counties
without
special
legislative
authority
cannot
issue
bonds
even
to
build
a
courthouse
or
to
provide
for
industrial
improvements
or
to
levy
taxes
for
those
things.
in
fact,
everything
they
do
must
be
authorized
by
the
legislature,
because
they
act,
as
i
say,
administratively.
and
of
course,
this
is
not
done
on
a
blanket
basis;
it
is
done
on
a
county-by-county
basis,
because
mississippi
has
a
local
and
private
section
in
its
constitution
very
similar
to
that
which
virginia
had
and
even
perhaps
more
stringent
that
the
court
alluded
to
in
the
mahan
case.
so
you
can
see
very
clearly
that
to
vulcanize
or
fractionalize
the
county
lines
would
change
the
whole
structure
of
government
in
mississippi,
a
structure
that
has
existed
since
before
its
statehood,
and
to
diminish
that
would
simply
make
vagrants
out
of
the
fractionalized
counties,
and
it
would
affect
the
system
of
justice.
it
could
affect
crime
prevention,
cause
electoral
problems,
cause
economic
problems,
and
it
would
affect
the
county’s
ability
to
aid
the
poor,
the
disadvantaged,
the
old,
the
sick,
through
the
various
county
programs
that
they
have
for
that,
because
each
of
those
have
to
be
approved
by
the
legislative
plan.
and
to
familiarize
the
court
with
the
'79
court
plan,
42
of
the
82
counties
have
been
broken
or
fractionalized,
and
at
least
44
of
these
supervisory
beats
have
been
fractionalized.
another
important
factor
to
point
out
there
is
that
the
precincts
that
the
people
of
mississippi
vote
in
are
contained
entirely
within
a
supervisory
district
or
a
beat,
and
if
you
change
a
supervisory
line
or
if
you
change
a
beat
line,
as
the
plans
that
the
plaintiffs
have
submitted
to
this
court
do
--
they
cross
beat
lines,
they
cross
the
voting
precinct
lines.
it
would
call
for
an
entire
re-registration,
and
i
think
all
of
us
would
agree
that
as
long
and
as
hard
and
as
difficult
as
it's
been
over
the
years
to
finally
get
the
black
population
of
mississippi
registered
--
and
in
mississippi
once
you're
registered,
you're
registered
for
life
unless
you
move
out
of
the
district.
so
you
don't
have
to
re-register
every
year,
you
stay
registered
for
life
and
a
change
in
this
system
if
you
had
to
change
all
of
that
could
cause
a
massive
re-registration
and
perhaps
a
dropping
from
the
roles
of
many
of
the
people
who
now
can
vote.
speaking
to
one
question
that
was
brought
up
by
the
plaintiff,
in
the
new
plan,
the
'79
plan
that
fractionalizes
the
county
lines,
in
the
mississippi
house
representatives,
there
are
30
districts
with
a
black
population
of
over
50%.
there
are
40
districts
with
a
black
population
from
36%
to
50%.
so
70
of
122
representatives
would
be
elected
from
a
36%,
which
is
basically
the
percentage
in
the
house;
70
of
those
representatives
would
be
elected
from
districts
with
36%
or
more,
and
in
the
senate
14
majority-black
population
over
15%
districts
and
12
districts
between
36%
and
50%,
which
makes
a
total
of
22
senators
who
could
be
elected.
and
as
one
of
you
said
in
an
opinion
--
i
believe
it
was
a
fifth
circuit
opinion,
though,
in
the
florida
case
that
said
if
you've
got
that
type
of
a
population,
you
are
going
to
be
receptive
to
it
if
you
expect
to
get
their
vote,
and
certainly
they
participated
very
strongly
in
the
'75
elections,
to
the
end
that
it
was
stated
that
the
black
vote
was
primarily
responsible
for
the
election
of
the
present
governor.
but,
again,
i'm
not
going
to
get
in
my
brother’s
argument.
i
would
like
to
address
as
my
last
point
the
fact
that
the
district
court
had
no
authority
to
order
the
two
elections
in
the
'79
plan.
before
a
district
plan
can
order
a
remedy,
it
must
find
a
constitutional
infirmity.
this
court
spoke
to
that
in
swann
v.
mecklenburg
when
it
said
that
there
had
to
be
a
constitutional
violation
before
the
great
equity
powers
of
the
federal
court
could
reach
it,
and
the
district
court
found
that
this
'75
plan
was,
in
fact,
constitutional,
and
it
has
never
been
found
unconstitutional
by
any
other
court.
and
even
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
the
district
court
was
required
to
formulate
single-member
districts
statewide
and
thus
affirm
the
'79
plan,
the
district
court
would
still
lack
the
authority
to
order
the
elections.
the
reason
being
that
the
plan
was
not
found
constitutional
and
that,
therefore,
all
of
the
legislators
who
were
elected
