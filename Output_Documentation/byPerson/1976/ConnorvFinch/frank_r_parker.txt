mr.
frank
r.
parker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
reapportionment
of
the
mississippi
legislature.
the
case
was
filed
on
october
19th,
1965
by
black
voters
in
mississippi.
it
is
here
for
the
fifth
time
following
a
final
hearing
directed
by
this
court
last
term
in
conner
v.
coleman.
in
that
case,
this
court
directed
the
district
court
to
hold
a
final
hearing
to
the
end
of
entering
a
permanent,
court-ordered
legislative
reapportionment
plan
to
be
applicable
in
the
1979
elections
and
also
ordering
any
necessary
special
elections
to
be
held
to
coincide
with
the
november
1976
presidential
elections,
or
at
the
earliest
practicable
date
thereafter.
in
november
of
1976,
the
district
court
entered
a
final
judgment,
which
was
amended
by
its
order
of
december
21st,
ordering
a
permanent,
court-ordered
legislative
reapportionment
plan
from
mississippi,
which
provides
single-member
districts
statewide.
no
special
elections
have
yet
been
held
under
that
plan
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
court.
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
the
district
court
complied
with
the
1971
injunction
and
the
1975
injunction
of
this
court
that
in
court-ordered
legislative
reapportionment
plans,
single-member
districts
are
to
be
preferred.
plaintiffs
contend
first
that
the
district
court’s
senate
plan
is
excessively
malapportioned.
secondly,
that
the
district
court’s
permanent
plan
unnecessarily
minimizes
and
cancels
out
black
voting
strength
in
the
senate
and
in
certain
districts
in
the
district
court’s
house
plan.
three,
that
the
district
court
erred
in
ordering
special
elections
in
only
two
house
districts
and
in
no
new
senate
districts.
and,
fourth,
that
the
district
court
erred
in
denying
plaintiffs
their
motion
for
an
award
of
reasonable
attorney’s
fees.
the
district
court,
in
deciding
the
case
and
in
entering
final
judgment,
employed
two
criteria
which
are
directly
relevant
here.
first
of
all,
the
district
court
held
in
its
opinion
reported
at
419
fed.
supp.
on
page
1076,
paragraph
4:
“there
shall
be
no
minimization
or
cancellation
of
black
voting
strength”.
that
was
the
criterion
employed
by
the
district
court,
and
as
far
as
we
can
understand
from
the
briefs
of
the
defendants,
that
criterion
is
not
questioned
on
appeal.
but
everyone
agrees
it
was
proper
for
the
district
court
to
promulgate
a
plan
in
which
there
is
no
minimization
or
cancellation
of
black
voting
strength.
and
fifth:
"population
variances
are
to
be
as
near
de
minimis
as
possible”,
and
that
criterion
is
not
the
question.
it
was
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
follow
these
criterion
in
implementing
its
single-member
districting
plan
which
plaintiffs
question
on
appeal.
the
senate
plan
is
excessively
malapportioned.
in
gaffney
v.
cummings
and
in
white
v.
regester,
1973
cases,
this
court
held
that
in
legislatively
inactive
reapportionment
plans,
a
plan
with
a
total
deviation
which
exceeds
10%,
is
prima
facie
unconstitutional
and
must
be
rationally
justified
by
legitimate
state
policies.
in
chapman
v.
meier,
the
court
held
that
in
court-ordered
legislative
reapportionment
plans
that
the
court
must
be
ordinarily
achieve
the
goal
of
population
equality
with
little
more
than
de
minimis
variation.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
this
is
applicable
in
chapman
v.
meier,
the
court
laid
down
standards
applicable
for
the
court-ordered
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
case
involves
both
issues.
the
case
involves
both
issues,
we
challenged
the
district
court’s
plan
on
both
grounds,
failure
to
conform
to
one
person
and
one
vote,
and
for
racial
dilution.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
we
believe
that
white
versus
regester
also
involved
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
i
believe
it
did,
your
honor,
because
it
involved
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
in
dallas
and
baylor
counties
in
texas.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
of
course,
the
court
has
failed
to
distinguish
between
equal
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
it
prohibits
racial
discrimination
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
it
prohibits
racial
discrimination
and
the
right
to
vote.
the
same
standards
very
often
apply
in
both
cases.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
correct.
that
has
to
do
with
malapportionment,
and
both
issues
are
involved.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
right.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
when
we
say
that
the
district
court’s
plan
is
excessively
malapportioned,
that
involves
the
reynolds
v.
sims
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
is
relates
to
population
disparities.
when
we
say
that
the
district
court’s
senate
and
house
plan
in
certain
districts
dilute
black
voting
strength,
we're
applying
both
the
racial-discrimination
prohibitions
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and,
more
specifically,
the
fifteenth
amendment’s
prohibitions
against
the
abridgement
of
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
that
is
not
our
contention.
we
do
not
at
all
contend
that
the
district
court
was
under
a
duty
to
maximize
black
voting
strength.
our
only
contention
is
that
the
district
court,
as
the
district
court
itself
recognized,
was
under
a
duty
to
avoid
dilution
of
black
voting
strength,
to
avoid
minimizing
or
canceling
out
black
voting
strength.
we
are
not
after
reverse
gerrymandering;
we
are
not
after
maximizing
black
voting
strength.
we
simply
say
that
the
district
court,
as
the
district
court
itself
recognized,
was
under
a
duty
to
avoid
dilution,
and
it
failed
to
do
so.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
avoid
dilution
in
terms
of
--
and
i'll
demonstrate
this
on
the
maps.
for
example,
claiborne
county
is
74%
black
and
has
black
county
elected
officials;
almost
all
the
county
officials
in
claiborne
county
are
black.
claiborne
county
was
combined
with
copiah
county
district
3
and
lincoln
county,
which
is
majority
white,
to
create
a
district-wide
white
majority
in
that
senate
district,
and
that
is
dilution;
when
a
substantial
black
population
concentration
is
combined
with
a
more
populous
white
population
concentration
to
create
a
district-wide
majority,
then
dilution
occurs.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
if
a
plan
can
be
drawn
which
meets
one
person-one
vote
requirements
and
also
does
not
fragment
or
disperse
a
heavy
black
population
concentration,
resulting
in
the
opportunity
of
black
voters
to
elect
legislators
of
their
choice,
then
that
alternative
should
be
selected,
all
other
things
being
equal,
if
it
meets
constitutional
requirements.
our
contention
is
that
the
district
court
in
promulgating
its
plan
failed
to
accept
the
alternatives
proposed
by
the
plaintiffs
and
by
the
plaintiff
intervener,
which
alleviated
or
cured
the
dilution
of
black
voting
strength
in
the
district
court’s
plan;
in
other
words,
there
were
alternatives
presented
to
the
district
court
which
did
not
dilute
black
voting
strength,
and
it's
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
select
these
alternatives
which
is
erroneous
and
which
we
question
on
appeal.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes,
there
are
districts.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes,
there
are.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
mississippi
legislature
has
been
all
white
until
1967
in
this
century.
there
are
now
four
blacks
in
the
house,
and
the
mississippi
senate
is
all
white.
no
claim
has
ever
been
made
in
mississippi
that
white
people
are
deprived
of
legislative
representation,
either
by
the
minimal
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
there's
no
claim
presented
to
this
court
that
it
deprives
white
people
of
legislative
representation.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
right.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
is
right,
they
are
not
discriminated
against,
because
legislative
representation
is
based
more
on
interest
groups
than
on
individuals.
at
most,
blacks
under
the
district
court’s
plan
could
elect
legislators
of
their
choice
in
possibly
24,
25
or
26
districts;
thus,
in
a
122-member
mississippi
house,
the
mississippi
house
of
representatives
will
be
still
predominantly
white.
the
senate
will
have
at
most
possibly
seven
or
eight
black
senators;
the
senate
will
be
predominantly
white.
so
there's
no
real
claim
of
discrimination
against
white
people
in
the
district
court's
plan.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
on
mississippi
is
36.8%
black.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
right,
that
is
correct.
now,
the
district
court’s
plan
has
a
total
deviation
from
population
equality
of
16.57%,
prima
facie
unconstitutional.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
we've
not
made
that
argument.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
we
don't
make
that
claim.
we
simply
say
that
district
court
was
under
an
obligation
to
avoid
dilution,
and
that's
all.
that's
as
far
as
our
claim
goes.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
that's
not
necessarily
true,
because
the
district
court
was
providing
a
remedy
here.
the
district
court
was
providing
a
remedy
for
the
failure
of
the
mississippi
legislature
to
adequately
apportion
itself,
number
one;
and
also,
number
two,
although
the
district
court
failed
to
recognize
it,
the
district
court
was
providing
a
remedy
for
the
extensive
past
history
of
racial
discrimination
affecting
the
right
to
vote
in
mississippi,
and
this
court
has
never
held
in
the
race
cases
that
when
a
district
court
is
fashioning
a
remedy,
it
must
be
a
color-blind
remedy.
certainly,
a
remedy
must
be
race-conscious;
otherwise,
the
remedy
might
have
the
same
effect
as
the
violation.
so,
for
example,
in
the
employment
cases
and
the
jury
cases
and
in
the
other
school
cases,
the
court
has
indicated
that
the
district
courts
may
take
race
into
account
in
formulating
a
remedy.
so
we
are
not
maximizing
black
--
our
claim
is
not
the
black
voting
strength
should
be
maximized.
this
is
a
false
issue.
it's
an
issue
raised
by
the
defendants
which
is
not
in
the
case.
our
claim
is
only
that
district
court
was
under
an
obligation
to
avoid
dilution
of
black
voting
strength,
and
they
failed
to
do
that.
the
alternative,
the
modified
henderson
plan
which
was
proposed
by
the
plaintiffs,
has
a
total
deviation
of
only
13.66%,
and
therefore
it's
not
a
plan
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
it
was
proposed
on
october
8,
1976
as
a
supplement
to
our
motion
in
the
district
court
to
alter
or
amend
its
judgment.
the
district
court
gave
no
reason
for
rejecting
the
modified
henderson
plan,
which
provides
greater
equality
of
population
among
the
districts,
over
its
own
plan,
which
provides
less
equality
of
population
among
the
districts.
the
plan
was
presented
to
the
district
court
on
october
8.
the
final
judgment
was
not
rendered
until
november
18.
the
district
court
failed
to
state
any
reason
for
preferring
its
own
plan
with
higher
variances
over
the
henderson
plan
with
lower
variances.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
district
court’s
plan
is
16.57;
the
plaintiffs'
alternative
the
modified
henderson
plan
was
13.66.
it
was
based
exclusively
on
county
boundaries,
supervisors'
districts
and
voting
precincts,
breaks
up
only
15
counties,
as
opposed
to
19
counties
in
the
district
court’s
plan.
the
district
court’s
plan
also
in
the
senate
unnecessarily
fragments
and
dilutes
black
voting
strength.
this
map
illustrates
the
11
instances
in
which
black-majority
counties,
which
are
colored
in
red,
are
combined
with
more
populous
white-majority
counties
to
create
districts
which
have
white
voting
majorities.
and
the
particular
illustration
of
this
is
claiborne
county,
which
is
combined
with
beat
3
of
copiah
county
and
more
populous
white-majority
lincoln
county,
to
put
claiborne
county,
which
is
74%
black
in
a
white-majority
district.
similarly,
jefferson
county,
which
is
just
to
the
south,
is
75%
black.
mayor
charles
evers
is
mayor
of
the
county
seat,
fayette,
it
is
combined
with
two
beats
in
adams
on
the
top
and
two
beats
in
adams
on
the
bottom
and
has
the
largest
deviation
of
any
of
the
district
court’s
districts,
minus
8.3%.
those
districts
are
not
compact.
the
plaintiffs'
alternative
plan
would
have
been
to
put
claiborne,
jefferson
and
copiah
in
a
single
compact
district,
not
break
any
county
lines,
result
in
a
black-majority
district
with
a
total
deviation
of
only
3.5%.
so,
thus,
plaintiffs'
alternative
would
have
alleviated
the
dilution
of
black
voting
strength,
would
have
cured
the
malapportionment,
would
have
provided
a
more
compact
district
and
would
not
have
broken
any
county
lines.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
we
believe
that
under
chapman
v.
meier,
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
is
more
limited
than
if
the
legislature
had
enacted
this
plan;
that
in
a
court-ordered
plan,
a
district
court
has
a
more
strict
and
more
rigid
responsibility
to
avoid
dilution
of
black
voting
strength,
and
the
standard
is
a
more
strict
one
than
under
a
legislatively
enacted
plan.
hinds
county,
the
district
court’s
senate
districts,
69%
of
the
black
population
of
hinds
county
is
concentrated
in
this
red-shaded
area,
which
looks
like
a
boot,
in
the
central
city
of
jackson,
which
is
the
state
capitol.
all
five
of
the
districts,
senatorial
districts
adopted
by
the
district
court
in
the
senatorial
plan,
cut
into
this
heavy
black
population
concentration,
slice
it
up,
disburse
it
among
all
five
districts.
this
is
a
copy
of
exhibit
p44,
which
is
in
the
kirksey
case,
in
which
the
district
court
has
taken
judicial
notice
and
which
is
in
the
record.
districts
2
and
5
have
slight
black
population
majorities;
but
measured
in
terms
of
voting-age
population,
all
five
districts
have
white
voting-age
population
majorities
under
1970
census
data.
so
black
people
in
hinds
county,
84,000
black
people
live
in
hinds
county,
it
has
a
greater
black
population
concentration
of
any
county
in
the
state.
hinds
county
is
39%
black.
those
84,000
black
people
living
in
hinds
county
are
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
elect
state
senators
of
their
choice
in
any
of
the
five
districts.
the
district
court’s
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
it's
residents
and
where
the
lines
are
drawn.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
we
make
the
argument,
because
they're
not.
the
lines
are
cut
through
them
and
break
up
and
disburse,
it's
an
apple-pie
plan;
it
just
slices
them
up
among
all
five
districts.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
we
say
that
white
v.
regester
indicates
standards
which
were
applicable
to
legislatively
enacted
plans,
and
that
provides
some
indication.
but
we
think
that
chapman
v.
meier,
the
principal
case,
chapman
v.
meier
said
that
multi-member
districts
in
court-ordered
plans
are
no
good,
among
other
reasons
because
of
the
charges
and
complaints
made
that
the
multi-member
districts
dilute
the
minority
voting
strategy.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
it
comes
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
abridgement
of
the
rights
of
voters.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
no,
chapman
was
under
the
fourteenth
amendment;
no
claim
of
racial
dilution
was
made.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
well,
reynolds
v.
sims,
the
goal
of
reynolds
v.
sims
was
fair
and
effective
representation.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
did
not
mention
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
white
v.
regester.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
we
think
that
was,
again,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
that
was
my
understanding
of
the
case,
yes,
your
honor.
it
specific
--
white
v.
regester
specifically
refers
to
a
legislative
reapportionment
plan
which
operates
to
deprive
minorities
of
the
opportunity
to
elect
the
legislators
of
their
choice.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
it
was
my
understanding
that
it
did.
it's
my
understanding
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
involved.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
we
cite
the
lower
court
case
of
taylor
v.
mckeithen.
taylor
v.
mckeithen
was
a
fifteenth
amendment
case
and
also
of
the
lower
court
decisions,
we
cite
robinson;
we
cite
moore
v.
the
flora
county
in
lower
court
cases.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
yes,
there
were
several
hinds
county
plans
that
were
placed
in
the
record.
our
preferred
plan
is
the
hinds
county
census-tracked
plan,
which
i
believe
was
exhibit
p14
in
the
trial-court
record,
which
was
based
exclusively
on
census
tracks
determined
by
the
bureau
of
the
census
in
hinds
county.
the
justice
department
also
put
forth
a
hinds
county
plan,
and
plaintiffs
put
forth
an
additional
hinds
county
plan
in
the
record;
so
there
are
several
hinds
county
plans
in
the
record.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
all
of
the
plans
in
the
record
have
very
small
variances.
the
hinds
county
census-tracked
plan
has
a
variance
--
mr.
frank
r.
parker
the
plan
which
was
favored
by
the
plaintiffs
only
has
a
total
variance
of
about
3.5%.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
it's
not
my
understanding
that
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
our
proposed
plan
and
the
three-judge
court's
plan.
mr.
frank
r.
parker
there
are
a
number
of
alternatives
which
could
avoid
dilution
of
black
voting
strength
and
still
conform
to
one
person-one
vote
requirements.
the
other
maps
relating
to
the
house
districts
are
contained
at
the
back
of
the
reply
brief,
and
i
would
simply
refer
the
court
to
those
maps
showing
dilution
of
black
voting
strength
in
the
house
districts
of
which
we
complain.
