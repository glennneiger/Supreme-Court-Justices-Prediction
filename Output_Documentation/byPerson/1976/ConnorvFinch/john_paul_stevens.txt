justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
leonard,
is
it
not
correct
that
they've
been
approved
only
with
respect
to
the
numerical
problem,
not
the
dilution
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
fifth
circuit
addressed
the
dilution
problem,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question,
so
that
i
can
find
the
answer
in
the
written
materials
that
are
quite
voluminous.
your
opponent
put
the
map
up
of
the
senatorial
districts
in
hinds
county
with
the
two
long
fingers
in
districts
32
and
33
going
into
the
town,
which
are
somewhat
reminiscent
of
gomillion
and
so
forth.
where
is
the
stateâ€™s
explanation
of
why
it
was
necessary
to
draw
those
rather
unusual
boundaries
found?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
anything
in
the
written
materials,
including
anything
the
district
court
said,
which
explains
why
the
lines
were
drawn
in
hinds
county
the
way
they
were?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
nothing
in
your
briefs
on
that
precise
point.
