justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
get
one
thing
clarified
in
one
of
your
responses.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
population
ratio
of
37
must
be
reflected?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
other
words,
you're
standing
on
your
response
to
justice
marshall,
i
think,
that
there
is
no
claim
on
your
part
of
a
constitutional
right
to
--
the
term
is
maximize
the
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
one
man’s
dilution
is
another
man’s
maximization,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
parker,
in
this
connection,
when
was
the
modified
henderson
plan
first
proposed
to
the
three-judge
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
leonard,
getting
to
the
present,
as
i
understand,
the
other
side
says
that
the
lines
have
been
drawn
in
the
last
few
years
have
effectively
diluted
the
vote
of
the
negro.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
not
past.
you're
talking
about
the
present.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
plan
is
he
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
heard
his
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
extensive
findings
that
negroes
are
not
denied
the
right
to
vote
means
nothing
to
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
of
course,
they
can
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
way
hinds
county
was
broken
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
recent;
that
is
not
ancient
history.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
leonard,
what
do
you
do
about
a
case
a
little
while
ago,
united
states
v.
classic,
said
that
although
the
man
wasn't
denied
the
right
to
participate,
his
vote
was
not
counted?
remember
that
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
said
it
had
to
be
a
meaningful
vote,
that
is
what
classic
said
and
that
was
about
30
years
ago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
have
how
many
people
in
the
legislature?
justice
thurgood
marshall
another
historical
reason,
too.
