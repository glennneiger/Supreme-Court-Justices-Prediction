justice
potter
stewart
and
why
is
this,
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
the
constitution
that
lays
down
standards.
justice
potter
stewart
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
equal
protection,
so
is
this
a
reynolds
against
sims-type
case,
or
is
it
a
gomillion
against
lightfoot-type
case?
is
this
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
only
been,
i
think,
one
case
in
this
court
involving
the
impact
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
on
the
electoral
franchise,
hasn’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
say
so?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
say
so?
did
the
opinion
say
so?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
reynolds
v.
sims
and
that
whole
lot
of
cases
has
nothing
to
do
with
racial
discrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
case
like
gomillion
against
lightfoot
has
everything
to
do
with
the
fifteenth
amendment...
justice
potter
stewart
except
for
mr.
justice
whitaker’s
concurrence.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
my
question
is,
which
amendments
of
the
constitution
are
at
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
contention
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
district
court
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
maximize
black
voting
strength?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
facts
speak
very
loudly,
i
understand
your
argument,
but
i'm
not
quite
sure
you've
answered
my
question
of
dilution
as
compared
with
what,
as
compared
with
the
racial
makeup
of
the
population?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
anything
less
than
the
proportion
that
the
population
itself
bears
is
at
least
suspect.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
district
court’s
plan,
are
there
now
districts
where
whites
are
the
minority?
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
there
any
such
districts
where
those
whites
under
the
former
plan
were
not
the
minority?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn’t
the
white
people
have
the
same
kind
of
a
claim
that
you're
asserting
on
behalf
of
negro
people?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
district
court’s
plan.
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
the
district
court’s
plan,
there
are
districts
where
whites
are
now
the
minority.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
same
voters
used
to
be
in
a
district
that
was
majority
white.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
population;
63-37,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
37,
63,
plus
a
fraction
of
1%
others.
justice
potter
stewart
finally,
i
have
for
announcement
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
in
no.
76-777,
connor
against
finch
and
three
related
cases.
the
question
in
this
litigation
concerns
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
legislative
reapportionment
plan
devised
by
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
for
mississippi's
senate
and
house
of
representatives.
in
no.
76-777
and
no.
76-935,
the
appellants
are
the
mississippi
voters
who
originally
brought
this
class
action
in
the
district
court
12
years
ago.
they
challenged
the
court's
entire
senate
plan
and
aspects
of
the
house
plan
as
failing
to
meet
the
basic
one
person,
one
vote
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
no.
76-934,
the
appellant
is
the
government
which
was
an
intervener
in
the
district
court.
these
appellants
joined
in
asserting
that
the
district
court's
plan
works
an
impermissible
dilution
of
negro
voting
strength
and
they
challenged
as
well
the
district
court's
decree
for
its
failure
to
order
special
elections
in
all
legislative
districts
where
new
or
significantly
stronger
negro
voting
majorities
were
created
by
the
district
court's
plan.
in
no.
76-933,
the
appellants
are
the
state
officers
who
were
named
as
defendants
in
the
district
court.
these
appellants
assert
that
the
district
court
should
have
accorded
greater
difference
to
mississippi's
historic
policy
of
respecting
county
boundaries
and
thus
should
have
established
multimember
legislative
districts
and
they
further
assert
that
the
court
barred
in
ordering
any
special
elections
at
all.
we
do
not
reach
all
the
complicated
issues
raised
by
the
various
appellants
because
we
have
concluded
that
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reapportionments
ordered
by
the
district
court,
failed
to
meet
the
most
elemental
requirement
of
the
equal
protection
clause
in
this
area.
that
legislative
districts
be
as
nearly
of
equal
population
as
is
practicable.
accordingly,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
twelve
years
have
passed
since
this
litigation
began,
but
there
are
still
no
constitutionally
and
permissible
apportionment
plan
for
the
mississippi
legislature.
it
is
therefore
imperative
for
the
district
court
in
drawing
up
a
new
plan
to
make
every
effort,
not
only
to
comply
with
established
constitutional
standards
but
also
to
allay
suspicions
and
avoid
the
creation
of
concerns
that
might
lead
to
new
constitutional
challenges.
in
view
of
the
serious
questions
raised
concerning
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
present
decrees
unusually
shaped
legislative
districts
in
areas
with
concentrations
of
negro
population,
the
district
court
on
remand
should
either
draw
a
legislative
districts
that
are
reasonably
contiguous
and
compact
so
as
to
put
to
rest
suspicions
that
negro
voting
strength
is
being
impermissibly
diluted
or
explain
precisely
why
in
a
particular
instance
that
goal
cannot
be
accomplished.
the
task
facing
the
district
court
on
remand
must
be
approached,
not
only
with
great
care
but
with
a
compelling
awareness
of
the
need
for
its
expeditious
accomplishment
so
that
the
citizens
of
mississippi
at
long
last
will
be
enabled
to
elect
a
legislature
that
properly
represents
them.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
opinion
he
has
joined
by
the
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
