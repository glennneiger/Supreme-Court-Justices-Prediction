that
issue
here,
that
fact,
is
just
relevant
to
the
dilution
argument,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
to
the
population-variance
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
are
you
addressing
all
these
arguments
together,
or
are
you
going
to
separate
them?
what
are
you
arguing,
just
dilution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
wondering
on
the
variance,
the
population-variance
issue,
what
is
your
submission
or
is
there
any
limit
to
the
population
variation
that
you
might
claim
to
be
justified
by
following
county
lines?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
state
submission
here
that
none
of
the
county
line
breaking
should
be
countenance
that
everywhere
the
district
court
broke
a
county
line,
that
should
be
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
what
is
it
arguing
in
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
does
the
cloth
run
out,
when
do
you
get
to
such
a
population
variation
that
you
have
to
break
a
county
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
make
a
submission
on
that,
or
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
not
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
then,
do
you
support
the
'75
plan
right
across
the
board
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
it's
a
fourteenth
amendment
case,
not
a
fifteenth?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
the
fifteenth
amendment
relied
on
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
plaintiffs?
