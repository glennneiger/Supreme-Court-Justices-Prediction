mr.
jerris
leonard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
jerris
leonard,
and
as
the
attorney
general
has
said,
i
will
address
the
question
of
the
relief
requested
by
the
plaintiffs
and
by
the
plaintiff
interveners
and
their
entitlement
thereto
and
also
the
question
of
racial
dilution,
which
was
alluded
to
in
the
questioning
this
morning.
i
would
frame
the
issue
raised
in
this
case
in
this
manner:
in
a
state
where
blacks
have
total
access
to
the
political
process,
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
65%
to
75%
of
the
voting-aged
blacks
are
registered
to
vote
against
a
national
average
of
only
55%,
and
where
60%
to
70%
of
those
blacks
who
are
eligible
to
vote
actually
do
vote,
as
compared
to
only
34%
on
a
nationwide
basis.
and
where
blacks
hold
over
200
local
offices,
hold
25
of
the
100
seats
on
the
democratic
state
executive
committee,
as
well
as
the
state’s
co-chairmanship
of
the
democratic
party
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
where
blacks
have
played
important
roles
in
both
the
republican
and
democratic
campaigns
for
governor
in
1975
and
are
credited
with
carrying
the
state
for
the
president
in
1976,
where
a
report
by
the
department
of
justice
fails
to
disclose
a
single
actionable
violation
of
black
voting
rights,
where
the
plaintiffs'
key
witnesses
and
their
important
evidence
fails
to
disclose
any
vestige
of
racial
discrimination
against
blacks
in
the
electoral
process
and
in
the
political
process
of
this
state,
and
where
a
reapportionment
plan
has
been
fashioned
by
a
federal
district
court
and
it
is
found
to
be
racially
nondiscriminatory.
based
on
those
facts,
the
issue,
i
believe,
is
whether
under
such
circumstances
a
federal
district
court,
in
fashioning
such
a
plan
of
reapportionment,
must
first
abandon
a
150-year
policy
of
non-fracturing
of
county
boundaries.
second,
abandon
a
150-year
policy
of
using
multi-member
districts;
and
finally,
affirmatively
racially
gerrymander
the
legislature
in
order
to
guarantee
or
attempt
to
guarantee
the
election
of
a
certain
percentage
of
blacks
to
that
legislature.
now,
that
is
what
i
believe
the
issue
is
that's
been
framed
in
this
case
over
its
long
history.
general
summer
has
addressed
the
question
of
the
state’s
policy
and
history
relative
to
the
multi-member
districts
and
their
use
and
the
non-fracturing
of
county
boundaries.
my
argument
will
be
confined
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
plaintiffs,
or
the
lack
thereof,
to
a
remedy
and
to
the
remedy
that
they
seek.
and
i
trust
that
the
solicitor
general
will
not
take
umbrage
if
i
take
the
position
that
i
think
the
constitution
is
definitely
involved
in
this
case
and
that
constitutional
standards
are
applicable
whether
the
plan
of
reapportionment
is
drafted
by
a
federal
court
or
whether
it's
drafted
by
the
legislature.
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
mississippi
is
one
of
the
six
co-equal
branches
of
government
of
our
federal
system,
and
its
reapportionment,
as
in
the
case
of
its
49
sister
states,
should
be
judged
by
constitutional
standards
and
not
by
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
to
direct
something
to
a
lower
federal
court.
so
i
think
without
question
the
constitution
is
involved,
and
i
think
it's
a
fourteenth
amendment
question,
justice
white,
and
not
a
fifteenth
amendment
question.
now,
the
plaintiffs'
argument
is
fashioned
around
the
scarlet-letter
philosophy.
having
sinned
in
the
past,
no
amount
of
reform,
no
matter
how
extensive
and
complete,
will
be
recognized
as
having
overcome
the
past,
and
the
citizens
of
the
state
must
forever
bear
the
stigma
of
that
past.
every
constitutional
question,
it
seems,
that
is
raised
by
every
action
taken
by
the
state
must
be
viewed
in
the
perspective
of
the
past
and
not
by
the
facts
as
they
exist
today,
if
we
accept
the
argument
of
the
plaintiffs.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
things
have
changed
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
it
is
not
the
tuskegee,
alabama
of
gomillion
v.
lightfoot,
nor
is
it
the
bexar
and
dallas
counties
of
white
v.
regester.
the
findings
with
respect
to
this
case
are
contained.
contrary
to
a
statement
made
by
our
opposition
earlier
today
that
there
are
few
findings,
there
are
extensive
findings
in
this
case
made
by
judge
coleman
at
396
federal
supplement.
now,
that
was
a
1975
decision;
but
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
except
for
some
of
the
new
re-workings
of
the
reapportionment
plans,
all
the
basic
evidence
was
in
the
case,
and
judge
coleman
made
extensive
findings
in
that
decision.
he
found
that
the
political
process
in
the
state
was
totally
and
completely
open
to
black
voters,
and
that
finding
is
really
not
seriously
disputed
by
the
plaintiffs.
in
a
companion
case
in
kirksey
v.
the
board
of
supervisors
of
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
that
fact
is
relevant
to
the
dilution
argument.
mr.
jerris
leonard
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
jerris
leonard
my
argument
relates
to
the
racial
dilution
and
the
affirmative
gerrymandering.
that's
the
thrust
of
it.
i
will
be
happy
to
answer
those
other
questions,
also;
but
that's
the
thrust
of
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
jerris
leonard
there
must
be,
let
me
point
out
one
small
exception.
mr.
jerris
leonard
no,
it
is
not,
justice
white.
mr.
jerris
leonard
our
point
is
that
if
there
is
to
be
any
fracturing
whatsoever,
it
should
be
de
minimis
and
only
when
the
cloth
runs
out;
and
that's
what
happened
in
the
'75
plan.
there
wasn't
any
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
well,
the
population
variation.
mr.
jerris
leonard
i
would
make
a
submission,
yes.
i
would
say
that
the
variation
in
this
case,
which
because
of
the
fact
that
none
of
the
figures
are
as
certain
as
they
should
be,
appears
to
be
about
20%.
mr.
jerris
leonard
and
i
would
say
that's
not
enough.and
it's
off
the
dilution
argument,
but
let
me
follow
up
and
say
why.
in
just
the
time
between
1970
and
1973,
the
population
of
hinds
county,
the
largest
county,
changed
by
18%.
that's
enough
for
one
house
member
alone,
just
in
three
years.
so
if
we
get
too
hung
up
on
the
figures
and
their
absoluteness,
we
delude
ourselves,
because
the
figures
are
changing;
the
population
changes
so
fast
in
almost
every
state.
i
would
submit
that
the
20%
variation,
which
is
the
approximate
variation
in
the
'75
plan,
is
not
an
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
yes,
we
do,
justice
white,
and
we
would
ask
this
court
and
i
will
in
my
closing
will
point
that
out.
we
support
the
'75
plan.
mr.
jerris
leonard
yes,
i
do.
mr.
jerris
leonard
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
jerris
leonard
i
believe
the
plaintiffs
so
stated
this
morning.
i
don't
see
how
this
question
is
a
fifteenth
amendment
question;
this
is
an
equal
protection
question.
it's
a
question
of
compelling
state
interest
or
having
certain
laws
relating
to
the
ways
in
which
a
legislature
is
reapportioned
in
order
to
avoid
the
other
process.
the
process
which
will
result
logically
from
the
plaintiffs'
argument
is
eventually
a
political
gerrymandering.
those
who
have
the
power,
whether
they
be
the
conservatives
or
the
liberals
in
the
legislature,
whatever
their
political
situation
may
be,
will
use
that
philosophy
in
the
1980s
and
beyond
to
exclude
others
with
whom
they
have
political
differences.
and
this
court
in
a
dissent,
justice
douglas
in
wright
v.
rockefeller,
justice
then
judge
stevens
in
cousins
v.
the
city
of
chicago
laid
out
in
those
dissents
all
of
those
dissents
all
of
the
horrors
that
come
about
from
that
process.
but
on
the
dilution
theory,
judge
nixon
in
a
companion
case
said
this:
“this
court
does
not
find
that
any
of
the
electoral
laws
presently
in
effect
in
hinds
county
or
this
state
operate
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
blacks
to
equally
participate
in
the
electoral
process”.
judge
coleman
in
the
decision
i
referred
to
said
this:
“we
have
no
difficulty
in
holding
that
at
the
present
day,
interference
with
the
right
of
black
citizens
to
cast
their
ballots
is
a
myth.”
now,
does
there
not
then
come
a
time
in
the
evolution
of
the
political
process
when
the
yoke
and
the
burden
of
the
past
is
lifted
from
state
government.
when
its
political
institutions,
to
the
extent
that
the
allegations
of
racial
discrimination
are
made,
must
be
established
based
on
present-day
conditions
and
with
credible
evidence
and
not
with
recitations
of
the
litanies
of
bygone
years.
judge
nixon
put
it
this
way
in
his
decision:
"there
is
a
point
in
time
when
past
instances
or
examples
of
racial
discrimination
become
remote,
a
time
when
a
past
history
becomes
a
remote
history".
that
time
has
arrived
for
hinds
county
and
on
behalf
of
the
state,
we
submit
that
it
has
also
arrived
for
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
jerris
leonard
that
is
right.
mr.
jerris
leonard
justice
marshall,
that's
not
the
finding
of
the
district
court
in
this
case.
mr.
jerris
leonard
i
do
not
know,
but
the
district
court
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
i
heard
him,
the
district
court
made
extensive
findings.
judge
coleman
made
extensive
findings.
mr.
jerris
leonard
justice
marshall,
i
can
only
tell
you
that
--
mr.
jerris
leonard
the
'75
court
plan
provides
for
14
senators
that
will
be
elected
from
populations
with
over
55%
black;
30
representatives
from
the
house,
a
total
of
76,
as
the
attorney
general
pointed
out.
mr.
jerris
leonard
that's
part
of
the
hinds
county
case,
which
has
been
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit
thus
far.
mr.
jerris
leonard
it
is
not
here.
mr.
jerris
leonard
you
mean,
is
it
involved
in
this
case?
mr.
jerris
leonard
yes,
because
it
was
incorporated
in
the
hinds
county
apportionment
was
incorporated
here.
mr.
jerris
leonard
justice
marshall,
what
i
am
trying
to
point
out
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
judge
nixon.
the
fifth
circuit
has
ordered
a
hearing
en
banc,
so
its
treatment
of
the
hinds
county
question
has
not
yet
been
disposed
of;
but
the
hinds
county
districts
that
are
in
this
case
now
in
the
'79
apportionment
plan
and
the
'75
have
been
approved
in
the
kirksey
decision.
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
jerris
leonard
no,
i
believe
judge
nixon
addressed
the
dilution
problem
in
the
kirksey
decision,
and
as
did
the
fifth
circuit
in
affirming.
mr.
jerris
leonard
it
addressed
the
racial-discrimination
problem,
whether
it
was
raised
in
the
terms
of
the
dilution,
the
point
is,
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
by
virtue
of
dilution
and
the
apportionment
of
the
county
was
raised.
mr.
jerris
leonard
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
that
the
explanation
is
that
because,
as
attorney
general
summer
pointed
out.
the
county
is
an
administrative
and
judicial
more
than
it
is
a
legislative
unit,
unlike
our
concept
of
county
boards
in
the
north,
where
county
boards
have
broad
home-rule
powers,
broad
legislative
functions.
such
is
not
the
case
in
mississippi.
the
county
supervisor
and
this
is
the
history
of
the
term
'beat'
had
a
beat
that
he
walked
apparently,
because
he
supervised
the
roads,
saw
to
it
that
the
roads
were
taken
care
of.
he
acts
more
like
an
alderman
in
a
city
taking
care
of
the
ministerial
municipal
functions
of
the
government,
as
opposed
to
acting
as
a
legislator.
now,
that
is
not
in
and
of
itself
justification,
as
this
court
has
taught;
but
it
is
one
of
the
factors
that
needs
to
be
considered
when
you
have
draw
an
apportionment
plan
for
that
kind
of
a
governmental
unit.
mr.
jerris
leonard
my
recollection,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
district
court
in
396
addressed
all
of
those
issues,
including
the
apportionment
of
hinds,
harrison
and
jackson
county,
and
why
it
made
the
choices
that
it
did.
mr.
jerris
leonard
i
think
that
there
is
not
on
that
precise
point.
we
believe
that
this
court
means
what
it
says
in
its
decisions
and
that
its
teachings
are
equally
applicable
to
mississippi
as
they
are
to
marion
county,
indiana,
to
the
state
of
texas,
to
washington
d.c.
and
to
arlington
heights,
illinois.
this
court
said
in
whitcomb
v.
chavis,
which
was
the
marion
county,
indiana
case,
that
the
challenger
must
carry
the
burden
of
proving
that
multi-member
districts
unconstitutionally
operate
to
dilute
or
cancel
the
voting
strength
of
racial
or
political
minorities.
there
is
no
such
proof
in
this
case.
this
court
said
further
that
such
schemes
or
devices
must
be
purposeful
in
order
to
further
racial
or
economic
discrimination.
there
is
no
such
proof
in
this
case
and
this
court
said
further
in
whitcomb
that
the
failure
to
win
elections
is
not
the
test,
but
rather
exclusion
from
the
elective
process
is
the
test
that
must
be
applied,
and
the
proof
in
this
case
gives
no
indication
that
blacks
are
excluded
from
the
process;
the
opposite
is
true
that
they
fully
participate.
mr.
jerris
leonard
well,
if
his
vote
wasn't
counted
because
the
election
officials
are
corrupt.
mr.
jerris
leonard
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
the
proof
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
blacks
not
only
participate,
but
they
are
a
political
power
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
jerris
leonard
they
have
4
members
of
a
122-member
house
this
time;
but
there
is
historical
reasons
for
that,
and
that
is
that
the
blacks
did
not
participate
in
the
party
elections
prior
to
1970.
mr.
jerris
leonard
yes,
this
court
said
in
white
v.
regester
that
there
must
be
a
showing
of
invidious
discrimination
that
excludes
minorities
from
the
political
process
by
a
practice
of
slating
of
candidates,
which
was
the
practice
in
texas,
so
that
they
were
unable
to
gain
access
to
the
party
primaries.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
primaries
are
open
primaries
any
candidate
can
run
in
either
primary
of
his
choice,
and
there
is
no
slating
of
candidates
as
was
countenanced
in
texas.
now,
this
court
also
said
in
white
that
multi-member
districts
are
not
per
se
unconstitutional.
in
the
1975
plan
that
is
before
this
court,
the
multi-member
districts
are
few
in
number,
they
are
small
in
the
number
of
members
in
each
multi-member
district,
and
they
are
compact
in
size.
this
court
reiterated
in
white
that
it
was
the
plaintiffs'
burden
to
prove
that
the
political
process
leading
to
nomination
and
election
was
not
open
to
all
groups
on
an
equal
basis.
this
court
said
just
last
year
in
washington
v.
davis
that
official
acts
are
not
unconstitutional
solely
because
of
a
racially
disproportionate
impact
without
showing
of
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose,
and
the
court
in
that
case
cited
wright
v.
rockefeller.
this
court
said
that
there
must
be
motivation
based
on
racial
consideration.
there
must
be
a
contrivance
to
segregate
on
the
basis
of
race.
only
where
the
totality
of
the
facts
disclosed
an
invidious
discriminatory
purpose
would
a
statute
otherwise
neutral
on
its
face
be
struck
down.
and
we
are
taught
in
arlington
heights
the
same
thing,
the
reference
in
that
case
to
gomillion
as
stark
discrimination.
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
the
situation
in
this
case
can
be
referred
or
compared
to
gomillion
and
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
stark.
now,
in
the
case
that
bar
the
plaintiffs
and
the
interveners
allege,
but
have
not
shown,
that
the
three-judge
federal
district
court’s
plans
were
either
'75
or
'79
are
racially
discriminatory
as
they
are
applied
to
black
citizens
in
mississippi.
we
are
not
here
defending
the
united
states
district
court.
we
have
appealed
from
its
decision;
however,
the
record
in
this
case
is
barren
of
any
proof
that
either
of
this
plans,
the
'75
or
the
'79
court-ordered
plan,
are
tainted
with
any
racial
motive
or
discriminatory
purpose.
i
opened
by
phrasing
the
issue;
let
me
close
it,
may
it
please
the
court,
by
seeking
this
as
relief:
that
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
all
citizens
enjoy
the
privilege
of
franchise
irrespective
of
their
race,
color
or
creed;
that
the
political
processes,
including
the
seeking
and
holding
of
elective
office,
are
open
to
all.
that
black
citizens
participate
in
that
process
in
the
party
of
their
choice
and
to
the
extent
that
their
desires
and
abilities
carry
them
in
that
process;
that
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
found
its
1975
plan
of
apportionment
of
the
state
legislature
to
be
constitutional,
to
be
in
conformity
with
150
years
of
official
history
of
that
state
in
the
use
of
multi-member
districts
and
in
keeping
county
boundaries
intact.
that
the
deviation
from
the
norm
of
the
two
houses
in
that
plan
is
within
constitutional
limits
and
governed
by
the
facts
in
this
case;
and
that
such
plan
shall
remain
in
full
force
and
effect
until
the
legislature
shall
reapportion
based
on
the
1980
census,
according
to
the
laws
and
constitution
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
the
united
states
of
america;
and
that
this
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
enter
its
final
order
in
conformity
with
such
opinion.
in
that
way,
may
it
please
the
court,
will
this
longstanding
litigation
be
drawn
to
a
close
and
thus
end
the
constitutional
inquiry.
mr.
jerris
leonard
if
a
court-ordered
plan
both.
mr.
jerris
leonard
both
conform
perform
to
one
person-one
vote
and
also
provide
a
proportional
representation.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
no.
mr.
jerris
leonard
yes,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
jerris
leonard
not
if
it
provided
proportional
representation
to
all
interest
groups.
mr.
jerris
leonard
no,
and
we
do
not
insist
upon
that
in
this
case.
mr.
jerris
leonard
you
mean
that
if
every
legislative
district
was
37%
black
and
63%
white?
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
the
hypothetical.
no,
that
wouldn't
be
adequate.
mr.
jerris
leonard
it
would
not
be
adequate.
in
mississippi,
there
is
a
history
of
racial
bloc
voting.
white
voters
refused
to
vote
for
black
candidates
or
candidates
favored
by
the
black
community.
in
that
hypothetical,
the
result
would
inevitably
be
an
all-white
mississippi
legislature.
we
have
gained
four
already
in
this
case.
please
don't
deprive
us
of
them.
mr.
jerris
leonard
not
if
every
legislative
district
was
37%
black,
no,
not
at
all.
that
would
deprive
blacks
of
the
opportunity
to
elect
legislators
of
their
choice.
mr.
jerris
leonard
that's
in
the
evidence
of
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
number
of
political
scientists
and
sociologists
testified
with
regard
to
voting
patterns
in
this
case.
let
me
rebut
several
arguments
made
by
the
defendants.
first
of
all,
they
rely
on
the
district
court’s
findings
at
396
fed.
supp.
1308.
unfortunately,
that
district-court
decision,
which
made
those
findings
upon
which
defendants
rely,
was
reversed
by
this
court
at
421
u.s.
and
this
court,
in
reversing
that
district
court
decision
upon
which
defendants
rely,
stated
specifically
the
district
court
accordingly
also
erred
in
deciding
the
constitutional
challenges
to
the
acts,
based
upon
claims
of
racial
discrimination.
so
in
reversing
396
fed.
supp.,
this
court
vacated
those
findings
by
the
district
court,
and
the
defendants
can't
rely
on
them
here
because
they've
been
reversed.
none
of
the
alternative
plans
relied
upon
by
the
plaintiffs
are
split
voting
precincts
or
are
based
on
supervisors'
districts.
all
of
the
alternatives
upon
which
plaintiffs
rely
are
based
either
on
county
lines,
supervisors'
districts
or
voting
precincts,
so
those
could
be
implemented
immediately
without
any
required
re-registration
of
the
voters.
now,
the
plan
upon
which
the
defendants
rely,
the
1975
plan,
is
totally
invalid
under
this
court’s
decisions
in
chapman
v.
meier
and
the
other
cases
upon
which
we
rely.
in
other
words,
in
order
for
the
court
to
accept
defendants'
proposal
to
re-institute
the
1975
plan,
the
court
have
to
overrule
east
carroll
parish
school
board
v.
marshall,
chapman
v.
meier,
mahan
v.
howell,
connor
v.
williams
and
connor
v.
johnson.
now,
the
defendants
made
a
big
argument
about
what
was
in
the
record
with
regard
to
county
government.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
with
regard
to
the
question
of
how
the
legislature
runs
county
government.
judge
coleman
was
a
former
governor
of
the
state.
a
member
of
the
legislature
would
not
have
ordered
this
plan
into
effect
if
it
had
been
unfeasible.
thank
you.
