unknown
speaker
the
board
of
education,
detroit
board
of
education
was
at
that
time
a
defendant
in
the
case,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
would
have
any
--
the
state
officials
would
have
any
standing
here
if
the
detroit
board
had
agreed
with
the
district
court’s
order,
and
the
district
court’s
order
it
sort
of
sought
to
impose
no
financial
burden
on
the
state
officials?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
in
the
absence
of
that
finding
is
critical,
that
the
findings
that
were
made
would
justify
transportation
remedy
and
no
other
is
bussing
the
only
permissible
remedy
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
response
to
my
question
that
that
is
the
only
permissible
remedy?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
to
be
pupil
reassignment.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
in
that
connection
i
want
to
be
sure.
i
take
it
you
are
arguing
basic
lack
of
power
in
the
court
or
are
you
arguing
the
existence
of
power
but
in
abuse
of
it
here.
unknown
speaker
is
the
similar
remedy
would
have
been
forbidden
in
brown
v.
board
of
education?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
court
observed
that
segregated
education
was
unequal?
unknown
speaker
well,
otherwise
how
do
you
go
about
finding
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
basis
for
any
remedy
at
all
for
any
constitutional
violation
at
all?
unknown
speaker
segregated?
unknown
speaker
what
is
wrong
with
that
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
brown
say
to
violation?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
include
a
ruling
that
segregated
education
is
unequal
or
not?
unknown
speaker
and
that
goes
for
this
case
to?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
about
a
remedy?
the
remedy,
inherently
unequal
education.
unknown
speaker
the
violation
is
furnishing
inherently
unequal
education.
unknown
speaker
by
segregating
school
children
on
the
basis
of
the
color
of
their
skins,
and
the
remedy
is
to
desegregate.
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute
mr.
attorney
general,
judge
roth
in
1972
did
find
uncontroverted
evidence
of
the
need
for
remedial
measures,
didn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
“uncontroverted
evidence
in
the
plan
filed
by
everybody,
that
certain
educational
components
including
in-service
training,
testing
evaluation
would
be
essential
to
any
plan.”
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
your
case
and
behalf
of
state
officials
somewhat
different
than
would
be
a
case
that
could
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
detroit
board
of
education,
if
they
objected
to
this
sort,
which
i
take
that
they
do
not?
but
if
they
did
object,
would
they
could
make
the
same
arguments
that
you
have
been
residing
that
it
goes
beyond
the
scope
of
the
violation
that
intrudes
too
deeply
into
the
authority
of
the
local
officials
that
type
of
argument.
but
i
have
thought
one
of
your
additional
arguments
on
behalf
of
your
state
officials
was
that
conceding
that
all
of
those
things
would
be
ruled
in
favor
of
the
court
of
appeals.
nonetheless,
the
eleventh
amendment
prevented
the
court
from
requiring
the
state
officials
as
opposed
to
the
detroit
officials
to
pay
for
it?
unknown
speaker
in
arvizu
you
were
talking
about
a
city
police
official.
unknown
speaker
the
chief
of
police
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
who
does
not
have
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
if
you
are
correct,
as
i
remember
the
findings,
there
was
a
finding
of
violation
by
the
state.
the
state
was
the
guilty
of
some
constitutional
violation.
is
there
any
remedy
at
all
that
could
be
ordered
against
the
state?
unknown
speaker
any
remedy
that
could
be
ordered
by
a
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
could
the
state
be
ordered
to
pay
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
buying
the
new
buses
in
the
transportation?
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
ordered
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
ordered
to
do
so
is
my
question?
unknown
speaker
could
it
be
ordered
to
do
so
consistently
with
your
theory
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
find
out
is
it
under
your
view
of
the
law
there
is
any
remedy
which
a
federal
court
could
order
against
the
state?
i
do
not
seem
to
find
any
in
your
answer,
you
say
you
have
done
some
things
voluntarily,
but
you
seem
to
dispute
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
grant
any
effective
remedy
against
the
state,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
it
including
compelling
the
state
to
contribute
to
the
cost
of
purchasing
new
buses?
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
to
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
i
do
not
understand?
you
do
concede
that
the
state
could
have
been
ordered
to
pay
the
buses?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
the
states
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
in
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
you
have
a
--
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
eleventh
amendment?
what
happens
to
your
eleventh
amendment
argument
if
you
are
going
to
concede,
the
state
could
have
been
ordered
to
pay
for
buses?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
it
is
my
question.
how
do
you
reconcile
your
eleventh
amendment
argument,
with
your
concession
that
you
could
be
ordered
to
pay
for
busing?
unknown
speaker
no,
how
can
you
be
ordered
in
face
of
your
eleventh
amendment
argument?
unknown
speaker
accepted
ten,
i
believe,
of
the
thirteenth
--
accepted
nine,
and
put
one
plan
of
its
own
into
the
situation.
and
in
effect,
in
a
remedy
we
are
asking
for
a
--
it’s
a
situation
where
there
is
a
remedy
being
directed
against
us
without
a
violation.
and
i
believe
that
it
follows
the
dictate
of
this
court
in
swann.
i
believe
the
federalism
argument
will
apply
and
i
also
believe
the
tenth
and
eleventh
amendment
would
also
apply.
because
of
our
state
constitution
in
effect
that
we
have
not
waived
nor
is
there
any
exception,
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
involved
here,
where
you
could
order
the
compulsion
of
payment
of
state
moneys
as
you
did
in
the
case
of
--
i
believe
it
was
not
griffin
but
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that
you
bypassed.
unknown
speaker
congress
--
unknown
speaker
by
appropriate
legislation,
it
is
congress
that
is
aiming
with
us?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
that
we
could
use
section
5?
unknown
speaker
you
are
a
party
to
the
litigation.
unknown
speaker
not
just
in
the
amicus
or
in
--
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
got
notice,
i
assume
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
say
what
you
want
to
say
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
on
the
remedy
question,
would
the
case
be
different
if
the
decree
instead
of
saying,
you
pay
50%
of
the
cost?
it
said
that
you
provide
the
books,
and
you
provide
the
teachers,
and
you
provide
the
testing
materials,
one
thing
that
asked
you
to
provide
a
lot
of
services
and
facilities
rather
than
just
plain
dollars.
would
that
present
a
different
issue?
unknown
speaker
well
there
is
a
--
there
was
a
finding
by
judge
roth
that
the
state
had
not
participated
in
the
situation
that
existed
the
violations.
that
was
not
challenged
in
the
original
milliken
v.
bradley,
and
i
think
the
opinion
said
that
that
finding
was
left
undisturbed,
if
i
recall
correctly.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a
finding
by
both
lower
courts
that
i
gather
is
not
challenged
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
the
state
had
participated
in
racial
discrimination
in
the
operation
of
the
schools,
that
is
what
the
finding
was.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
is
not
challenged.
unknown
speaker
and
you
do
not
challenge
that,
you
cannot
challenge
that?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn’t
that
the
violation,
segregation
of
pupils
based
upon
their
race
or
ethnic
background?
there
was
no
claim
was
there
of
inequality
other
than
that
of
inequality
among
the
various
schools,
was
there?
unknown
speaker
this
was
a
separate
but
equal
system
and
that
was
the
violation,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
was
that
ever
alleged
as
a
constitutional
violation?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
have
that
effect
on
black
children
or
not
on
white
children,
if
it
is
the
effect
of
segregation.
unknown
speaker
to
get
back
to
my
original
question,
my
mistaken
and
my
understanding
that
the
only
constitutional
violation
found
in
this
litigation
was
segregation
of
students
based
upon
their
color.
unknown
speaker
or
assignment
of
students
based
upon
their
color.
unknown
speaker
evolving
or
not
that
was
of
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
are
concerned
here
with
only
the
federal
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
they
were
also
found
to
be
violators.
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
that
in?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
some
questions
about
these
programs?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
that
there
are
four
of
them
before
us.
the
in-service
teacher
training,
counseling,
testing
and
remedial
reading.
how
long
has
detroit
had
all
four
of
those
components
in
its
school
system?
unknown
speaker
wait
just
a
minute.
do
you
know
any
major
school
system
in
the
united
states
that
does
not
have
them
or
any
school
system
that
has
not
had
them
for
quarter
of
a
century?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
you
see
any
finding
in
this
record
that
anyone
of
those
systems
was
enforced
in
a
discriminatory
way?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
and
i
am
in
favor
of
all
of
them.
but
my
question
is
what
constitutional
violation
was
found
with
respect
to
anyone
of
these
components?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
give
me
that
answer
if
i
ask
you
what
are
the
teaching
of
mathematics,
or
history,
or
civics,
or
any
other
subject
in
the
schools.
you
could
say
it
is
being
taught
inadequately,
the
segregation
was
the
cause,
could
you
not?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
why?
unknown
speaker
my
understanding
is
that
75%
of
the
pupils
are
black,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
79,
has
discrimination
occurred
with
respect
to
all
79%
of
the
pupils
of
the
detroit
school
system.
unknown
speaker
system-wide.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
composition
of
the
detroit
school
board?
you
have
five
members
of
system-wide,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
composition
of
that
board?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
have
regional
boards,
don’t
you,
eight
of
them.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
composition
of
eight
regional
boards?
unknown
speaker
how
many
are
eventually
all
white?
unknown
speaker
but
how
many
have
a
majority
of
white
members?
unknown
speaker
two
out
of
the
eight?
unknown
speaker
and
they
are
discriminating
against
themselves,
aren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
when
was
this
discrimination
in
these
four
component
programs?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
when
there
was
any
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this.
what
is
the
ratio
between
your
counselors
and
pupils?
how
many
pupils
per
counselor
in
the
detroit
school
system?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
compare
with
national
averages?
unknown
speaker
300-350
is
considered
the
best
relationship,
detroit
is
better
than
average.
unknown
speaker
may
i
say
this,
i
am
very
sympathetic
to
the
problem.
many
school
systems
in
the
united
states
are
inadequately
staffed.
i
know
people
in
this
business
who
think
they
ought
to
be
a
counselor
for
every
200
students.
suppose
the
district
judge
had
decided
that
that
ought
to
have
been
the
ratio,
and
instead
of
ordering
$11
million,
he
had
order
22.
you
will
be
here
supporting
that,
wouldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
just
a
second,
justice
powell.
we
have
taken
a
lot
of
your
time,
so
we
will
extend
your
time
five
minutes
and
the
same
on
the
other
side,
and
give
justice
powell
chance
to
pursue
his
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
roumell,
isn’t
the
real
dispute
here
not
between
the
school
board
and
the
district
court,
you
are
really
allying
with
the
district
court.
it
is
between
the
school
board
of
a
district
court
on
the
one
hand
and
the
state
on
the
other
not
over
the
nature
of
the
remedy
so
much
as
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
has
ordered
the
state
to
pay
unappropriated
funds
that
it
might
not
have
chosen
to
pay
to
detroit
for
it.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
money
--
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
an
order
to
pay
the
detroit
school
board
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
order
to
assist
it
in
implementing
this
program?
unknown
speaker
has
hew
not
furnished
some
expert
assistance
and
equipment
in
the
remedial
speech
area
and
remedial
reading
both,
in
some
of
these
cases
not
necessary.
unknown
speaker
as
a
remedy
for
unconstitutional
segregation?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
am
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
of
course
i
know
about
all
these
programs
of
remedial
reading
--
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
as
a
remedy
for
unconstitutional
segregation.
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
court
decrees
as
a
remedy
for
unconstitutional
segregation?
have
there
been
many
in
which
it
required
educational
components?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
cite
me
some
cases,
because
i
have
not
been
familiar
with
this
until
this
case?
unknown
speaker
are
we
want
to
reaffirm
here?
unknown
speaker
i
have
these
very
components
that
were
involved
here?
unknown
speaker
reaffirmed
in
swann.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
district
court
here
had
ordered
the
precised
educational
components
that
it
did,
but
declined
to
require
the
state
to
pay
any
money
towards
them?
would
the
school
board
and
the
individual
plaintiffs
have
still
supported
the
decree?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
say
that
the
adjuncts
were
not
enough
in
effect?
the
plaintiffs
would
have
continued
to
insist
as
you
earlier
mentioned,
that
the
adjunct
programs
were
not
the
essential
of
the
decree,
if
the
pupil
that
were
reassigned
by
itself
was
not
carried
out.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
may
i
interrupt
just
for
a
minute.
the
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
asking,
i
am
looking
at
the
appendix
that
is
filed
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
page
889(a).
this
appendix
states
that
the
financial
impact
of
these
orders,
they
are
the
orders
of
the
district
court
could
easily
destroy
the
educational
program
of
the
detroit
school
system.
the
financing
of
these
components
by
the
detroit
school
system,
would
only
mean
a
concomitant
elimination
of
existing
programs.
as
i
understand
that
that
came
from
a
brief
filed
by
the
board
of
detroit
education,
that
suggest
to
me
that
the
city
board
had
to
have
state
assistance.
if
you
hadn’t
had
state
assistance,
this
suggests
that
your
program
would
have
been
destroyed.
what
is
your
comment
about
that?
unknown
speaker
is
it
plaintiff,
the
school
board
or
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
is
the
quotation
as
i
understand
it
from
the
school
board
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
right,
oh,
yes.
well,
i
will
ask
you
this.
we
are
talking
about
it.
if
your
adversary
was
correct
in
saying
that
the
court
order
that
added
all
of
these
ingredients
into
the
educational
program
in
detroit
would
destroy
the
school
system
unless
the
state
came
to
the
relief.
do
you
think
the
district
court
has
that
power?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
do
not
think
the
system
would
have
been
destroyed?
unknown
speaker
the
power
to
destroy
the
school
system.
unknown
speaker
now,
does
that
require
funds
that
were
totally
beyond
the
means
of
either
the
city
or
state
to
provide?
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
talking
about
desegregation,
i
am
talking
about
the
determining
the
content
of
educational
program
of
a
school
system
that
is
supported
by
money
raised
from
taxpayers.

the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
ask
to
mr.
attorney
general,
i
noticed
that
the
government,
page

of
its
brief,
takes
issue
with
a
statement
of
yours
at
least
they
suggest
in
their
footnote
8,
that
you
err
in
asserting
that
the
charlotte-mecklenburg
decree
was
limited
to
student
assignments.
and
they
cite

mr.
fischer,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
related
to
my
brother
brennan
and
that
is,
in
the
swann
v.
charlotte
case,
was
the
state
of
north
carolina
ordered
to
pay
any
money
to
pay
for
those
facilities
so
far
as
you
know?
unknown
speaker
and
was
the
propriety
of
the
remedy
beyond
the
student
reassignment
an
issue
here
in
swann
v.
mecklenburg?
there
is
no
mention
--
there
was
no
mention
of
anything
--
unknown
speaker
or
any
of
that,
mr.
attorney
general.
unknown
speaker
this
sort
of
thing
is
not
noble,
isn’t
that?
the
sorts
of
tools
that
we
are
talking
about,
these
four
things
apparently
are
not
noble
in
desegregation.
