mr.
frank
j.
kelley
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
in
this
cause.
the
court
might
recall
that
i
was
here
some
three
years
ago
on
this
school
desegregation
case,
regarding
the
question
then
of
whether
the
lower
court
had
exceeded
their
authority
in
ordering
an
inter-district
remedy
in
the
absence
of
an
inter-district
violation.
in
reversing
this
court
at
that
time
held
that
the
constitutional
right
of
the
plaintiffs
was
to
attend
a
unitary
school
system
within
the
city
of
detroit,
and
remanded
the
case
for
formulation
of
a
decree
to
eliminate
the
segregation
that
existed
within
that
city.
following
the
remand
and
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
district
court,
the
plaintiffs
and
the
detroit
board
of
education
each
filed
a
desegregation
plan.
the
plaintiffs
plan
dealt
solely
with
pupil
reassignment.
it
contained
no
educational
components.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
the
plaintiffs
expert
testimony
in
the
remedy
stage,
their
expert
testified
that
the
plaintiffs
plan
would
in
fact
eliminate
the
segregation
plan
which
is
just
in
detroit.
on
the
other
hand,
the
detroit
board
of
educations
plan
in
addition
to
recommending
proposing
pupil
reassignment
for
the
first
time
included
cert.
13,
so-called
educational
components
at
a
projected
cost
of
$13
million
annually
to
its
plan,
and
that
the
detroit
board
in
addition
demanded
that
the
cost
of
these
expanded
educational
programs
be
paid
by
the
petitioners,
who
are
state
officials
in
the
state
of
michigan,
in
the
executive
branch
of
government
and
the
money
come
from
unappropriated
state
funds.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
probably
not
mr.
justice,
the
plaintiffs
at
the
time
that
the
detroit
board
of
education
made
this
recommendation
in
their
plan
responded
to
the
court
by
pointing
out,
the
plaintiffs
himself
pointing
out,
that
in
the
findings
there
were
no
violations
with
respect
to
educational
components.
now
yet
in
november
of
1975
the
court,
the
lower
court
then
entered
its
order
concerning
pupils
reassignment.
a
desegregation
plan
involving
some
27,000
students
in
105
schools
out
of
300
zone
schools
in
detroit.
this
desegregation
plan
was
peacefully
implemented
in
the
second
semester
of
january
1976.
we
submit
for
the
purpose
of
the
remedy
in
this
cause,
based
on
the
last
time
we
were
here
that
the
implementation
had
taken
place.
yet
on
may
11
of
that
year
1976,
the
district
court
entered
another
order
and
its
judgment
directed
that
there
be
ten
educational
components
to
be
put
into
effect
system-wide
in
september
of
1976,
and
each
year
thereafter
for
the
expanded
educational
components
of
reading,
guidance
counseling,
testing
and
in-service
training.
and
the
trial
court
ordered
the
state,
the
petitioners,
to
pay
half
of
the
excess
cost
of
implementing
the
systematic
expansion
of
existing
educational
components
from
unappropriated
funds
of
the
state
treasure.
now
pursuant
to
the
court’s
order,
the
detroit
board
disclosed
that
for
the
previous
years
1975,
1976
it
had
spent
$75
million
on
these
four
components.
it
also
pointed
out
that
the
expanded
order
of
the
court
as
to
these
four
components
would
cost
the
excess
of
$11.6
for
the
1976,
1977
school
year.
then
on
august
4,
1976,
the
court
of
appeals
in
cincinnati
affirmed
the
lower
court,
compelling
the
system-wide
expansion
of
existing
educational
programs
to
be
financed
with
additional
unappropriated
funds
from
the
state
treasury.
after
on
successfully
seeking
a
stay,
on
october
18,
1976
the
state
treasure
of
michigan,
issued
a
warrant
to
--
in
the
amount
of
$5.8
million
of
unappropriated
state
funds
in
the
state
treasury
and
paid
the
same
to
detroit
board
of
education.
now,
in
affirming
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
did
so
and
i
quote,
“without
prejudice
to
the
right
of
the
district
court
to
require
a
larger
proportion
of
payment
by
the
state
of
michigan,
if
found
to
be
required
by
future
developments”.
and
it
is
this
judicially
decreed
blank
check
to
be
filled
in
each
year
and
presented
for
payment
of
unauthorized
funds
upon
the
treasury
of
the
state
of
michigan
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
because
of
the
factor
that
there
was
no
adjudication
in
this
case
of
any
violation,
any
constitutional
violation,
with
regard
to
educational
programs
in
the
detroit
school
system
that
as
soon
as
the
lower
court
in
its
remedy
got
into
educational
components
it
was
beyond
its
jurisdiction
and
in
violation
of
the
principles
of
this
court
as
laid
down
in
swann
in
every
succeeding
case
thereafter,
including
the
last
time
i
was
here
when
the
court
at
there
exceeded
its
remedy.
the
detroit
board
does
not
need
a
federal
court
order
to
expand
education,
nor
the
only
reason
for
this
court
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
we
found
that
any
reasonable
type
of
pupil
reassignment
would
be
available,
because
the
violation
found
in
the
lower
court
mr.
justice,
had
to
do
with
pupil
reassignment
and
that
is
all
that
was
found,
there
was
no
violation
regarding
education
components
or
financing
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
any
reasonable
remedy
having
to
pupil
reassignment
would
not
necessarily
be
confined
to
bussing
in
my
judgment.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
believe
that
following
swann
when
there
was
no
finding
by
the
court
of
the
violation
having
anything
to
do
with
educational
components
but
in
these
desegregation
cases
it
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
the
court
in
this
case.
i
also
feel
that
in
this,
that
the
act
of
the
court
here
is
also
doing
violence
to
the
principle
of
federalism
as
laid
down
in
the
arvizu
case.
i
also
feel
that
it
is
doing
--
it
is
in-volitive
of
the
decisions
with
regard
to
the
tenth
and
eleventh
amendment
also
in
this
matter.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
well,
i
think
first
of
all,
let
me
answer
your
question,
the
first
part
is
that,
yes,
there
was
no
finding,
and
therefore,
it
is
beyond
the
remedy
part
of
the
court.
the
second
part,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
an
exception
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
where
the
court
could
come
in
and
compel
payment
of
money
from
a
state
treasury
for
some
inequity
found.
i
have
never
known
of
any
statute
or
any
congressional
act
that
lets
us
do
this
in
the
school
desegregation
case.
i
have
not
thought
ahead
to
the
principal
part
of
your
question
however,
because
i
have
been
concentrating
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
violation
here
and
the
trust
of
my
argument
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
believe
on
the
findings
of
brown
case
strictly
pupil
reassignment,
i
think
it
would
not
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
if
the
court
observed,
then
i
think
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
something
could
have
been
done,
but
it
is
not
true
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
any.
proofs
were
taken
in
this
matter,
in
the
detroit
case,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
this
matter
of
educational
components
and
finance.
the
court
did
not
become
convinced
by
that
evidence
and
there
were
no
findings.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
the
violation
in
this
case
was
that
the
detroit
board
was
found
guilty
of
unconstitutional
pupil
assignment.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
segregated
assignment.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
it
violates
brown.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
the
brown
said,
in
repudiating
plessy
v.
ferguson
and
that
line
of
cases
that
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
it
is
inherently
unequal
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
believe
so.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
believe
that
if
you
follow
the
rule
as
laid
down
in
brown
one
or
two
and
it
had
been
in
swann
and
then
in
this
case
that
the
scope
for
the
remedy
is
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
violation.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct,
and
i
believe
that
is
what
this
court
said
the
last
time
in
finding
a
violation
in
detroit
only
in
ordering
in
a
remand,
that
the
plaintiff’s
rights
in
this
case
were
to
a
unitary
school
system
within
the
confines
of
the
city
detroit
there
having
been
no
showing
on
the
record
of
any
finding
of
an
inter-district
violation
or
violation
of
any
district
outside
of
detroit,
and
now
we
are
back
here
again
on
a
remedy
where
there
has
been
no
showing
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
financing
of
the
detroit
school
system
or
any
violation
with
regard
to
educational
components
or
the
quality
of
education
within
the
school
system.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
it
is
not
in
the
orders
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
well,
i
can
only
say
to
you,
your
honor,
at
this
point
the
detroit
has
in
fact
unitary
school
system.
that
in
the
last
year
1975,
1976
we
spent
$75
million
on
those
four
components
that
the
judge
demascio
now
wants
expanded
in
a
remedy
phase,
so
that
we
are
committed
to
this
program,
it
is
part
of
a
unitary
school
system.
but
if
in
fact
the
record
as
we
see
it
did
not
show
that
there
had
been
any
constitutional
violation
of
plaintiff’s
rights
with
regard
to
accusation
and
finding
of
inequity
in
the
educational
components,
or
in
the
quality
of
the
education,
or
in
the
financing
of
the
school
system,
then
i
believe
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
court
now
in
the
remedy
stage
to
order
educational
components.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
we
feel
that
edelman
v.
jordan,
a
case
in
this
court
would
apply.
where
the
court
reiterated
the
rule
that
a
suit
by
private
parties
to
impose
a
liability
be
paid
from
a
state
treasury
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
now
our
constitution
in
michigan
provides
that
no
money
shall
be
paid
out
of
the
state
treasury
except
in
pursuant
of
appropriations
made
by
law.
the
people
of
michigan
have
reposed
the
appropriation
power
and
they
elected
--
alleged
representatives,
they
have
not
waived
the
eleventh
amendment
in
any
way
and
as
a
result
i
believe
we
do
have
the
protection,
i
think
we
also
have
the
protection
of
the
language
of
arvizu,
where
the
court
reaffirmed
the
principle
of
federalism
and
that
limits
the
injunctive
power
of
federal
courts
over
officials
in
the
executive
branch
of
state
level
of
governments.
this
was
a
matter
of
administering
educational
system
without
finding.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
right.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct,
that
is
actually
true
but
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
well,
the
state
has
already
paid
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
only
having
to
do
with
a
correction
of
the
remedy
with
pupil
reassignment,
and
any
part
of
the
state
could
play.
now
the
state
has
not
asked
to
submit
a
plan
or
the
state
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
the
state
board
did
pay
the
cost
of
200.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
it
did
so,
but
it
did
so
within
the
state
law.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
yes,
it
was
ordered
to
do
so,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
well,
as
it
turned
out,
the
payment
of
the
buses
in
this
case
was
done
within
the
state
constitution.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
believe
that
in
pupil
reassignment,
they
could
issue
any
order
that
was
reasonable
to
correct
the
federal
violation.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
would
agree
to
that.
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
as
far
as
the
tenth
amendment
is
concerned,
it
would
also
apply
here.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
it
can
be
ordered
because
in
this
particular
situation,
there
is
a
law
that
provides
for
the
state
to
participate
in
the
payment
of
buses,
it
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
state
constitution
or
the
state
law.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
it
did
not
waive
it,
but
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
the
practical
effect
we
paid
for
25%
of
these
buses,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
do
not
concede
that
the
state
has
waived
the
eleventh
amendment
in
the
abstract,
in
the
hypothetical
questions
posed
to
me
by
justice.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
we
could
pay
for
busing,
only
into
the
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
believe
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
have
to
be
argued
in
that
case,
and
that
the
state
would
have
to
be
defended
on
the
eleventh
amendment,
because
in
any
thing
that
we
have
done
in
this
case,
the
state
has
not
waived
its
eleventh
amendment.
so
what
is
misleading
about
this
case
is
that
we
were
able
to
buy
the
buses
within
state
law
and
under
the
state
constitution
by
future
appropriation
methods,
and
so
the
issue
has
never
been
drawn.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
it
was
the
detroit
board
of
education,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
was
not
in
the
plaintiffs
plan.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
the
congress’
law,
and
then
of
course
the
--
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
well,
the
court
reaffirmed
the
principle
in
arvizu
with
regard
to
courts,
even
though
that
was
local
officials.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
the
fitzpatrick
case,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
well,
there
is
no
statute
here
that
would
enable
the
lower
court
to
use
that
power.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
no,
i
am
sorry,
there
was
no
congressional
act
would
enable
the
lower
judge
to
make
an
exception.
and
the
case
i
have
referred
to
earlier
was,
where
there
was
a
section
5
exception
in
fitzpatrick
v.
bitzer,
where
having
to
do
with
employment
discrimination
and
there
was
authority
for
the
payment
of
state
funds
and
ordered
by
the
federal
courts.
but
we
do
not
have
that
present
in
this
case,
and
i
just
believe
that
despite
the
noble
purpose
the
lower
court
has
once
again
gone
into
a
remedy
situation
without
a
violation
having
been
found
in
the
record.
and
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
court
to
do
so,
and
i
think
it
not
only
fails
to
follow
the
principle
of
a
remedy
being
within
the
scope
of
the
violation,
but
it
also
violates
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
felt
that
we
would
be
bound
by
the
record,
there
was
no
opportunity
at
that
to
point
to
properly
put
forth.
i
do
not
believe
that
at
that
stage
the
court
was
authorized
to
make
a
finding,
because
i
do
not
believe
that
the
records
support
it
and
i
think
the
last
time
we
were
here,
we
included
this
matter.
the
judgment
had
been
entered
and
in
that
judgment
there
was
no
showing
in
the
record
of
a
violation.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
yes,
but
not,
only
to
the
extent
and
advisory
capacity
at
that
point
of
the
proceedings
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
we
had
the
same
standing
at
that
point
as
we
hindering
a
trial
of
the
matter.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
no,
no,
that
is
correct
we
are
a
party.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
but,
i
honestly
believe
that
at
that
point
in
the
proceedings
after
the
trial,
and
we
must
remember
that
the
late
judge
roth
was
the
original
trial
judge
in
this
matter.
we
are
faced
with
a
situation
where
a
succeeding
judge
came
into
the
matter
after
the
case
was
tried
and
the
record
was
developed.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
he
has
had
the
case
ever
since
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
is
true.
we
feel
that
this
case,
as
far
as
the
eleventh
amendment
is
concerned
it
does
follow
the
doctrines
laid
down
in
edelman
where
the
court
reiterated
the
rule
is
suit
by
private
parties
to
impose
liability
is
barred
and
even
though
the
state
has
not
named
to
party
in
this
case.
edelman
held
that
where
the
fact
is
they
compelling
your
money
from
the
state
treasury,
which
has
what
happened
here,
that
the
state
does
by
that
act
become
a
party
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
direct
compulsion
of
money
from
the
state
treasury,
it
is
not
some
ancillary
effect
or
some
perspective
injuncted
relief.
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
important
when
it
said
that
this
could
be
done
annually,
that
we
could
come
back
here
annually
and
take
unappropriated
funds
from
the
state
and
i
believe
that
we
would
have
a
repetition
on
eleventh
amendment
violations.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
do
not
think
so.
i
should
also
point
out
that
you
know,
this
is
not,
this
school
district
is
among
the
highest
20%
in
the
state
in
per
capita
expenditures.
this
year,
the
state
of
michigan
will
appropriate
under
proper
appropriations
from
its
state
treasury
to
the
city
of
detroit,
$192.5
million,
in
addition
to
any
local
taxation
or
federal
health
that
they
get.
they
are
among
--
they
hire
per
capita
school
districts
in
the
state.
we
have
not
been
parsimonious
with
them.
what
the
petitioners
on
the
state
object
to
is
the
ordering
of
unappropriated
funds
in
violation
of
our
constitution
from
the
state
treasury
in
the
absence
of
any
constitutional
violation,
that
is
what
we
are
here
for.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
do
not
believe
there
has
ever
been
a
finding
that
the
state
of
michigan
or
any
of
the
defendants
for
that
matter
have
been
involved
in
a
constitutional
violation
with
regard
to
educational
quality
or
with
regard
to
financing.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
with
regard
to
pupil
reassignment.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
no,
we
cannot
challenge
that,
your
honor.
we
are
only
challenging
the
remedy
that
is
being
used
here
beyond
of
the
nature
of
the
violation
and
in
violation
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
now
have
a
unitary
system
in
detroit
that
i
do
not
believe
anybody
can
question,
and
the
desegregation
and
the
implementation
for
the
elimination
that
the
desegregation
has
been
accomplished,
it
was
accomplished
in
january,
1976
and
there
was
no
complaint
from
anybody
on
that
score?
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
we
will
waive
any
rebuttal
and
thank
the
justices.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
well,
you
are
having
me
the
slightest
advantage.
we
believe
that
the
purpose
of
this
case
will
rely
on
our
brief.
mr.
frank
j.
kelley
i
know,
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
not
ordered
to
pay
any
money.
