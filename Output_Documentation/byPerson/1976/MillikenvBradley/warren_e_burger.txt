chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
here
on
76-447,
milliken
v.
bradley.
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
view
that
you
must
challenge
all
of
it
now,
the
open
and
the
blank
check
as
you
call
it,
or
if
you
did
not
prevail
now
do
you
consider
that
you
would
be
free
to
challenge
the
next
order
allocating
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
mr.
attorney
general,
that
the
district
court
may
be
finding,
an
explicit
finding
that
‘x’
number
of
children
in
the
schools,
all
of
this
based
on
expert
testimony
on
surveys
the
usual
way.
that
x
percentage
of
students
that
were
suffering
under
a
handicap
--
a
language
speech
handicap;
that
is
problems
of
gathered
life
and
gathered
speech.
and
that
to
bring
them
into
the
main
stream
with
their
peers
in
school
after
the
reassignment,
special
speech,
remedial
speech
programs
where
necessary.
there
is
no
such
finding
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
really
somewhat
like
justice
blackmun’s
question,
are
you
now
challenging
the
power
of
the
court
to
do
that,
or
are
you
challenging
here
that
no
such
--
no
findings
were
made
that
support
these
specific
educational
components
as
they
are
described.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
plan
is
it
that
includes
these
educational
components?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
accepted
by
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
court
approved
substantially
with
the
greater
part
of
the
proposed
plan,
nine
of
the
13
parts.
as
to
those
nine
parts,
isn’t
that
not
a
finding
of
the
district
court
of
the
need
of
those
components
in
the
total
educational
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
state
have
not
--
did
you
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
the
court’s
acceptance
approval
of
the
plan
to
the
extent
it
approved
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
it
go
to
judge
demascio
as
soon
as
it
came
back
on
the
remand
after
judge
roth’s
death?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
had
it
ever
since.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
attorney
general.
mr.
roumell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
roumell,
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
in
a
school
system,
which
as
in
detroit
is
79%
negro
or
washington,
d.c.
which
is
somewhat
similar.
the
need
for
the
counselors
is
higher
than
in
a
school
system
in
some
city
where
you
have
a
much
more
traditional
situation,
either
all
white.
is
there
a
greater
need
for
these
programs
when
you
have
79%
in
the
population?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
i
put
to
the
attorney
general.
i
have
put
to
him
the
question,
if
there
were
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
the
language
difficulties
of
these
negro
students
was
way
below
far,
it
is
both
in
speech
and
in
reading
and
the
finding
was
made
to
that
effect
specifically.
and
a
further
finding
that
it
was
necessary
to
engage
in
these
remedial
components
in
order
to
balance
that
out,
i
thought
he
said,
yes,
if
there
had
been
such
a
finding
that
would
be
s
different
case
from
the
one
here
and
then
i
put
to
him
the
question,
is
not
the
approval
by
the
district
courts
of
the
plan
submitted
by
the
board
of
education,
not
conceived
by
the
district
judge
but
by
the
board
of
education,
is
not
his
approval
the
equivalent
of
a
finding
on
that
score.
and
i
think
he
took
issue
there
and
said,
no,
he
did
not
think
that
was
specific
enough.
what
would
you
have
to
say
about
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
from
your
colleague
now
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jones,
referring
to
that
appendix
that
justice
powell
had
just
read
from.
that
is
attached
to
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit.
the
authorship
of
the
appendix
at
least
does
not
appear,
is
that
something
written
by
the
court
by
the
sixth
circuit
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
submitted
by
the
detroit
board
through
the
sixth
circuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
sixth
circuit
at
least
adopted
it
to
the
extent
of
attaching
it
as
an
appendix
to
it
--
is
it
the
text
is
an
appendix
to
the
opinion
or
is
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
there
when
the
opinion
came
down,
since
you
were
in
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh
yes,
they
make
a
reference
to
it.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
of
the
authorship
of
it,
because
it
seemed
to
be
hanging
in
somewhat
in
midair
in
this
form.
that
does
explain
at
the
top
of
180(a).
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
too
late
to
help
you
with
the
answer
to
that
question
that
was
put
to
you
but
once
i
was
asked
by
justice
black
this
similar
question,
i
said
sometimes
assistant
attorney
generals
argued
cases
but
they
do
not
always
prepare
all
of
the
papers
themselves.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

this
morning,

judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of

for
the
sixth

mr.
