mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
respondents,
ronald
bradley
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
before
sending
forth
the
reasons
for
urging
that
affirmants,
i
should
like
to
dispose
off
two
assertions
that
have
been
repeated
in
the
briefs
and
in
argument
here
by
the
state
petitioners.
first,
that
the
detroit
school
system
is
now
unitary
and
second,
that
the
respondents
have
been
in
our
oppose
to
educational
adjuncts
as
part
of
a
desegregation
plan.
let
me
first
observe
that
the
detroit
school
system
is
not
unitary.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
in
part
and
remanded
the
pupil
reassignment
portion
of
the
opinion,
in
so
far
as
it
left
untouched
three
regions
in
the
detroit
school
system
that
were
contained
over
100
schools
that
were
all
black.
sixth
circuit
said
that
this
situation
is
intolerable,
they
recognize
it
is
a
difficult
problem,
but
the
district
court
would
have
to
deal
with
this
problem,
it
could
not
leave
those
schools
with
these
100
black
schools
with
their
students
located
in
the
heart
of
the
section
of
detroit,
which
represented
the
very
essence
of
the
violation
to
go
untouched.
secondly,
it
totally
misrepresents
the
respondent’s
position
to
assert,
that
respondent’s
have
been
opposed
to
these
educational
adjuncts.
it
is
necessary
to
i
think
understand
the
dynamics
of
the
remand
proceedings
to
have
a
correct
understanding
as
to
what
took
place.
the
district
court
had
a
pre-occupation
with
the
cart
rather
than
the
horse.
there
was
undo
attention
we
felt
at
that
time
being
placed
upon
the
educational
adjuncts
and
ignoring
of
the
primary
element
of
a
remedy
which
was
the
desegregation.
these
are
adjuncts,
not
the
primary
element
of
relief
and
we
had
to
continue
to
refocus
the
court’s
attention
and
the
attention
of
all
the
parties
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
brown
violation
and
the
essential
remedy
had
to
be
pupil
reassignment,
elimination
of
the
discrimination
of
the
segregation.
and
secondly,
as
an
ancillary
matter
we
had
to
deal
with
curing
the
effects,
the
lingering
effects
of
that
primary
discrimination
in
the
primary
of
segregation.
the
state
petitioners
take
one
line
out
of
the
cross
examination
response
of
one
of
our
experts,
dr.
foster,
and
escalate
that
to
our
primary
position.
i
think
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
set
that
record
straight.
it
will
be
preposterous,
be
ludicrous,
absurd,
hypocritical,
and
a
reflection
of
the
continued
concern
we
have
had
for
the
evils
of
segregation
that
was
addressed
in
brown
for
the
respondents
to
be
challenging
the
inclusion
of
educational
components
in
a
desegregation
plan.
our
concern
was
in
saying
that
the
cart
followed
the
horse.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
this
is
not
unique
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
is
not
unique.
this
is
now
the
time,
in
fact
the
hew
as
a
part
of
its
desegregation
thrust
authorizes
and
puts
in
place
educational
components.
congress
through
its
legislative
enactments
has
recognized
its
notional
policy.
the
importance
of
including
educational
adjuncts
as
a
part
of
a
desegregation
plan
for
the
purpose
of
overcoming
the
intangible
and
the
enormous
effects
of
the
evils
of
segregation.
so
there
is
nothing
unique
about
this.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
not
necessary
but
when
call
upon,
they
have
done
it
when
applications
are
made,
hew
has
the
respondent.
there
are
a
number
of
--
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
not
as
a
primary
remedy.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
no,
no.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
merely
as
ancillary
assistance
to
--
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
no,
not
as
a
basic
remedy.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
well,
educational
components
are
generally
found
to
be
necessary.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
yes,
i
think
in
the
--
in
fact
in
the
state
of
michigan,
in
the
kalamazoo
case,
educational
components
were
made
apart
swann.
included
educational
components
as
a
part
of
the
remedy,
and
this
court
expressly
approved
it.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
that
is
correct
and
i
think
your
honor,
i
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
justice
department
by
the
solicitor
general
at
page
--
both
at
page
18
in
the
bottom
paragraph
in
which
the
government
recognizes
that
racial
discrimination
and
the
operation
of
schools
often
has
a
pervasive
effect
on
the
educational
process,
and
on
the
hearts
and
minds
of
students.
and
it
goes
on
in
note
that
the
remedial
decree
should
seek
to
alleviate
these
intangible
effects,
no
less
than
to
alleviate
the
assignment
of
students
to
race
the
identifiable
schools.
now
on
page
20
of
the
government
brief,
first
paragraph.
the
solicitor
general
puts
his
finger
on
the
number
of
problems
here,
the
problem
that
the
state
of
michigan
has
and
that
is
the
confusion,
which
it
has
between
goals
and
tools.
and
certainly
as
the
government
contends,
that
an
approach,
the
approach
they
suggest
would
unduly
constrict
the
flexibility
of
a
court
charged
with
creating
a
decree
that
will
eliminate
all
of
the
effects
of
the
racial
discrimination.
it
goes
on
to
note
that
congress
has
provided
in
20
u.s.c.
1703
that
no
state
may
deny
equal
educational
opportunity
by
failing
to
take
affirmative
steps
to
remove
the
vestiges
of
discrimination.
and
petitioners
would
deny
district
courts
the
tools
needed
to
achieve
that
goal.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
i
cannot
speak
for
the
school
board
and
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
the
plaintiffs
would
have,
as
we
did,
insist
upon
first
instance
the
desegregation
of
the
school.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
well,
the
plaintiffs
will
continue
to
insist
that
somebody,
some
agency
of
the
state
address
these
secondary
problems
that
are
part
of
the
bringing
about
the
creation
of
unitary
systems.
in
fact,
we
learn
as
we
grow,
and
one
of
the
lessons
that
has
been
learned
through
23
years
of
litigation
and
efforts
to
desegregate
school
systems
is
that
there
are
certain
problems
in
connection
with
creating
unitary
system
that
have
to
be
faced,
and
--
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
your
honor,
the
concern
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
no,
the
school
board
is
the
defendant.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
well,
i
am,
i
am
probably
the
one
to
comment
on
the
brief
of
my
adversary.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
well,
i
cannot
accept
the
premise.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
no,
i
do
not.
that
(inaudible)
us
quite
often,
and
i
would
not
accept
that
premise.
but
i
think
the
court
clearly
have
the
power.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
no,
not
the
power
to
destroy
the
school
system.
the
court
clearly
have
the
power
under
ex
parte
young
to
issue
an
injunction
to
require
agents,
an
agency
of
the
state
--
the
state
officials,
to
conform
their
future
behavior
and
future
conduct,
to
conform
and
comply
with
the
commands
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
well,
i
cannot
accept
that
assumption.
i
think
griffin
v.
prince
georgia’s
county
speaks
that
question.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
your
honor,
the
court
was
not
determining
the
program
of
the
detroit
school
system.
the
court
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
how
do
i
bring
about
a
conversion
of
an
unconstitutional
school
system
and
the
one
that
is
constitutional.
he
invited
the
parties
to
submit
plans.
plans
were
submitted
by
both
the
state,
by
the
detroit
board
and
the
plaintiffs.
the
state
participated
in
that
process
and
they
reached
the
conclusion,
and
the
court
adopted,
and
included
in
to
an
overall
plan
prepared
by
the
court,
what
in
his
judgment
based
upon
record
evidence
would
necessary
to
accomplish
the
legitimizing
of
that
unconstitutional
school
system.
and
that
is
what
we
are
concerned
with,
what
power
did
the
court
have
and
i
criticized
him
that
the
court
have
that
power.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
detroit
board
informed
us
mr.
chief
justice
about
that.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
i
cannot
explain
the
sixth
circuit,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
yes
it
was.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
very
well,
thank
you
mr.
justice.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
as
i
recall
reading
and
memorizing
that
matter
beyond
pupil
reassignment.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
well,
certainly
not,
michigan
has
pioneered
many
of
them
and
we
do
though
--
do
them
and
we
would
like
to
do
them,
but
we
would
like
to
do
them
within
our
constitution
and
within
the
framework
of
legislature
and
not
have
the
lower
court
sitting
in
a
position
of
a
super
school
board
when
it
is
beyond
the
violation.
thank
you.
mr.
nathaniel
r.
jones
well,
you
can
always
learn
them
i
thank
you.
