mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
about
our
remedy
for
a
state
imposed
condition
of
the
segregation
in
the
detroit
school
district
that
was
caused
by
two
separate
and
distinct
defendants.
the
detroit
board
and
the
state
of
michigan,
footnote
16,
milliken
i
verifies
this,
and
again
in
the
gautreaux
case
at
footnote
13,
this
court
reaffirmed
that
finding,
two
separate
and
distinct
defendants.
the
state
defendants
here
are
attempting
to
quest
this
court’s
statements
in
swann
and
milliken
that
the
nature
of
the
violation
determines
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
the
violation
here
is
segregation.
this
is
more
than
unlawful
pupil
assignment
that
scope
of
the
remedy
had
more
than
just
to
do
with
pupil
reassignment.
in
brown
i
--
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
in
this
respect.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
your
honor,
the
record
evidence
in
this
case
shows,
that
as
the
schools
in
detroit
evolved
one
black
school,
two
black
schools,
three
black
schools,
and
so
forth.
and
the
black
children
came
into
the
detroit
system
with
the
same
capabilities
and
with
the
same
potentiality
to
learn,
that
by
the
time
they
reach
the
eighth
grade
in
the
detroit
schools,
on
an
average
the
record
reveals
that
the
black
children
were
reading
that
sixth
grade
level
--
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
that
is
the
effect
of
segregation
in
detroit.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
because
your
honor,
one
of
the
major
reasons
for
this
reading
disability
is
unfortunately
teacher
perceptions,
toward
the
ability
of
their
student
to
learn
and
the
record
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
there
were
low
teacher
expectations
in
the
developing
black
schools
in
detroit.
it
was
an
unfortunate
result
proven
in
the
record
and
we
referred
the
court
to
our
supplemental
record
at
pages
1
to
23
where
we
lay
that
out
in
the
violation
states.
furthermore,
the
record
also
shows
your
honor,
that
in
testing
--
our
testing
proved
in
many
cases
to
be
culturally
bias
and
in
many
cases
unfortunately,
resulted
in
the
tracking
of
black
students.
again
i
referred
to
the
record
1
to
23
of
our
supplemental
record.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
the
effect.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
it
was
an
evolving
process
and
the
effect
of
this
--
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
that
was
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
and
the
state
constitutional
violation.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
well,
i
mean
the
state
defendants.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
what
we
are
saying
that
this
was
an
effect
of
that
violation
and
it
also
had
an
effect
as
violation
record
established
in
the
counseling.
it
institutionalized
the
concept
of
bias.
for
example,
in
a
majority
of
black
schools,
for
some
reason
in
our
aero-mechanic
school
where
we
were
training
children
to
go
into
the
aircraft
industry
we
had
an
80%
white
enrollment.
black
children
were
not
being
counseled
into
that
educational
opportunity.
so
one
of
the
purposes
of
equity
is
to
restore
the
children
where
they
would
have
been,
but
for
this
vidious
(ph)
segregation
in
detroit.
now
in
addition,
when
we
get
to
the
remedial
stage
of
the
hearings,
not
only
do
the
records
without
the
exception
confirm
what
i
have
just
said.
but
in
addition,
the
state
defendants
through
their
own
witnesses
and
unless
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
after
the
detroit
board
presented
their
plan,
the
state
was
asked
to
present
a
critique.
and
the
state
in
their
critique
said,
yes,
we
agree
to
overcome
the
obstacles
to
desegregation
in
detroit.
you
must
have
a
counseling
program
designed
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
segregation.
you
must
have
an
unbiased
testing
program
and
by
all
means
you
must
have
an
in-service
training
program.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
pages
18
to
24
of
the
brief
of
the
detroit
board
of
education,
where
we
cite
their
references
to
the
appendix
and
actually
quote
from
the
testimony
of
the
state
defendant’s
own
witness,
plus
our
witnesses,
plus
the
witnesses
of
the
plaintiff?
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
your
honor,
we
have
had
those
components
in
our
school
system
for
sometime
but
we
have
not
have
--
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
i
do
not,
but
the
components
we
are
speaking
--
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
your
honor,
two
things,
if
i
may
answer
the
question
in
two
parts.
the
components
we
are
speaking
about
here
are
not
the
routine
educational
programs
in
any
school
system.
these
are
restoration
overcoming
obstacle
programs.
they
are
designed
to
teach
counselor
for
example,
to
be
prepared
in
preventing
crises.
they
are
designed
to
open
up
to
rare
opportunity
to
the
black
children
that
have
been
deprived
of
them
in
detroit.
the
reading
program
is
designed
for
the
first
time
we
have
not
had
remedial
reading
at
the
high
school
level.
we
are
finding
children
who
went
through
our
system,
and
that
segregated
school
system,
not
being
able
to
read
at
the
high
school
level.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
the
constitutional
violation
was
a
violation
of
segregation
and
--
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
no,
i
could
not,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
because
the
second
prong,
not
only
the
question
of
restoring,
but
overcoming
the
obstacle.
when
you
bring
children
into
the
detroit
system,
into
a
desegregated
system,
dr.
foster
pointed
out
and
we
pointed
on
our
brief
in
the
testimony,
and
you
bring
children
into
a
classroom
that
have
all
different
levels
of
reading,
you
incur
difficult
teaching
problems.
and
eventually
the
children
who
have
been
discriminated
against,
who
have
been
the
victims
of
low
teacher
expectations
began
to
daydream
and
eventually
we
have
the
horrible-horrible
situation
in
detroit
of
black
dropout.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
79,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
it
was
system-wide.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
that
was
the
finding
of
judge
roth.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
no
sir,
we
have
13
members,
sir.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
at
the
present
time?
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
in
terms
of
race?
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
nine
black,
four
white.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
it
varies
from
region-to-region.
some
regions
are
virtually
all
black,
others
--
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
it
is
a
mixture,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
two,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
two
or
three.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
your
honor,
they
are
not
discriminating
at
the
present
time.
they
are
trying
to
correct
the
remedy.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
in
these
four
components,
your
honor
--
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
the
record
shows
that
at
the
time
this
lawsuit
would
begun
and
doing
the
course
of
the
law
school
there
was
desegregation,
this
evolving
process.
and
the
effect
--
the
effect
of
this
was
the
reading,
the
counseling,
the
problem
that
i
have
outlined
above
produced
by
the
evidence
on
this
record,
the
hard
evidence.
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
remedial
stages,
the
educators
with
all
the
exception
including
the
state’s
own
witness
says,
that
in
order
to
make
desegregation
work
in
detroit.
in
order
to
make
it
work
in
detroit,
we
have
federal
programs,
and
these
programs
are
not
spending
$75
million
for
existing
programs,
these
are
new
programs.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
practically
400.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
the
north
central
association
proposed
350.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
your
honor,
we
have
problems
in
detroit,
we
are
a
large
system.
we
have
large
dropouts
of
students.
we
have
tension
problem
caused
by
the
desegregation
and
that
we
are
trying
to
work
out.
we
cannot
explain
why
many
of
our
student,
we
have
the
counselors
into
these
system-wide
schools,
so
they
could
participate
in
desegregated
education.
part
of
our
tools,
our
entire
tools
in
the
educational
components
are
just
one
tool.
part
of
the
whole
tool,
there
is
a
whole
system
of
growing
children
of
both
races
into
the
various
schools,
and
we
have
the
counselor
so
their
parents
know
about
the
availability
of
these
opportunities.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
two
questions
if
i
may.
number
one,
he
did
not
decide
that
and
number
two,
the
state
of
michigan
had
every
opportunity
to
say
he
wasn’t
correct
in
what
he
was
ordering.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
privilege
the
joint
submission
to
the
court,
the
testing
program.
they
had
every
opportunity,
and
nowhere
in
their
record,
nowhere
in
this
record
had
they
challenge
that
these
programs
are
needed
to
restore,
to
overcome
the
obstacles.
we
are
putting
counselors
in
other
areas
in
the
detroit
system
so
that
particularly
in
our
middle
school,
so
that
our
children
can
gravitate
toward
these
city-wide
schools
and
the
magnet
schools
in
order
to
make
desegregation
plan
work.
it
is
a
detroit
situation,
it
is
a
way
segregation
evolved
in
detroit,
it
is
the
way
--
the
only
way
we
can
remedy
this
situation.
because
if
we
do
not,
if
we
do
not
utilize
these
tools
the
children
in
detroit
will
continue
that
have
the
lingering
badges
of
segregation
on
them.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
may
say
this.
i
am
only
familiar
with
the
record
in
the
detroit
situation,
and
i
believe
that
segregation
is
a
case-by-case
litigation.
and
i
believe
this
is
a
way
it
developed
in
detroit.
i
would
say
your
honor,
that
we
had
10%
black,
and
if
the
record
showed
that
because
of
desegregation
of
those
children,
that
it
would
necessary
to
give
them
remedial
program,
restoration
programs,
so
that
they
can
participate
in
the
desegregated
aspect
of
the
program,
then
we
would
have
to
have
it
in
that
system.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
your
honor
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
here
is
what
happened
here.
this
federal
judge,
like
any
other
judge
in
any
other
type
of
case
heard
the
evidence
and
you
had
the
board
of
education
coming
in
and
saying,
we
as
trained
educators
are
telling
you
that
we
cannot
desegregate
detroit
in
this
situation
unless
we
have
these
components.
we
have
the
state
defendants
coming
in
and
saying,
we
agree
on
three
of
them.
we
have
the
state
defendants
coming
in
and
saying,
we
are
submitting
a
joint
report
untested.
we
agree.
everybody
said
to
the
poor
little
judge.
here
it
is,
and
then
we
have
the
experts
from
the
plaintiffs.
two
men,
who
have
spent
their
lives,
their
professional
life
desegregating,
said,
yes,
your
honor
in
order
to
overcome
the
obstacle
the
desegregation.
you
must
have
these
educational
components.
now,
mr.
justice
powell,
this
is
what
happened.
this
did
not
come
from
the
minds
of
judge
demascio.
he
did
not
thought
of
us,
it
came
from
the
minds
of
every
person
that
was
in
that
courtroom,
every
report.
he
had
no
contrary
evidence.
it
had
no
difference
on
psychiatrist
in
an
accident
case
saying,
yes,
that
person
says,
a
trauma
as
a
result
of
this
accident,
and
there
must
be
a
remedy.
it
is
the
same
principle
that
happened
here
in
the
detroit
case.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
your
honor,
i
take
the
issue
with
the
question
of
quality
education.
i
called
it
restoration.
your
honor,
we
are
not
teaching
french
cooking,
home
economics
or
a
bible
as
a
literature,
we
are
restoring
children
and
we
are
trying
to
overcome
the
obstacles
to
segregation.
here
is
what
happened.
one
of
these
case
was
remanded.
the
detroit
board
utilizing
a
number
of
people
including
expert
from
the
university
of
michigan,
expert
from
michigan
state,
expert
from
wayne
state
university
developed
a
plan.
and
it
was
the
unanimous
view
of
the
detroit
board
that
they
should
present
to
the
district
court
as
part
of
the
plan
of
desegregation
as
another
tool
just
as
much
as
zoning
and
busing
as
another
tool
to
desegregate
detroit,
then
make
it
work
now.
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
the
detroit
board
did.
and
it
was
voted
on,
and
the
vote
was
unanimous.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
five
words,
your
honor.
it
was
the
finding,
and
may
i
respectfully
say
to
the
chief
justice,
and
the
court,
pages
18
to
34
of
our
brief
set
forth
those
specific
findingsaand
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
after
we
made
our
presentation
the
district
judge
said,
go
back.
work
with
this
sake
and
whittle
it
down
and
this
thing
has
been
refined,
it
gone
through
a
very
refined
position
with
the
state
participating
at
all
levels.
they
did
not
like
it,
they
could
have
filed
motions.
they
could
have
brought
it
to
the
attention
to
the
court.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
well,
the
district
court
did
not
order
the
state
to
pay
unappropriate
fund.
what
they
ordered
the
state
as
one
of
the
two
joint
wrongdoers.
they
were
wrongdoers.
to
put
in
these
programs
into
effect
and
they
did
not
give
a
blank
check.
the
only
order
that
is
before
this
court
is
the
order
to
do
that
and
the
representation
by
the
detroit
board
undisputed
by
the
state
defendants
that
it
would
cost
$11.6
million
and
the
state
was
asked
to
pay
less
than
$25
a
child.
now,
frankly
if
the
state
wanted
to
do
the
evaluation
of
the
test,
if
they
wanted
to
send
in
the
remedial
teachers,
if
they
wanted
to
send
in
the
counseling
help
that
we
needed,
and
put
on
the
in-service
training,
they
would
have
been
welcomed
to
do
it?
but
they
did
not
choose
to
that.
they
were
only
ordered
just
like
this
court
as
ordered
state
to
prepare
a
transcript
for
indigents
and
criminal
matters
that
is
all
they
were
ordered
to
do?
this
is
not
a
money
judgment,
and
there
are
wrongdoers.
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
absolutely
not.
nobody
would
order
to
pay
every
child
$200
because
of
these
violations?
mr.
george
t.
roumell,
jr.
well,
he
had
another
choice
they
could
have
just
put
the
program
in,
if
they
wanted
to,
but
i
do
not
call
that
as
a
money
judgment.
there
is
no
difference
in
ordering
a
state
to
provide
an
indigent
defendant,
a
transcript
or
a
legal
consult,
it’s
no
different.
you
have
to
meet
the
constitutional
remedy,
nobody,
nobody
as
you
serve
the
authority
of
the
state
or
the
detroit
board
in
running
an
educational
system.
all
the
district
court
said,
if
you
are
going
to
run
an
educational
system
run
at
constitution
and
the
$75
million
the
alleged
expansion
of
programs,
that
is
not
true.
we
are
not
expanding
the
existing
programs.
we
are
establishing
new
program
to
restore,
to
overcome
the
obstacle,
the
desegregation
in
detroit.
this
is
a
detroit
case.
