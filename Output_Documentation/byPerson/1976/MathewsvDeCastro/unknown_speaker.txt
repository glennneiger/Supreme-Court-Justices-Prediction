unknown
speaker
any
possibility
under
those
regulations
that
a
wife
could
collect
benefits
from
more
than
one
husband,
or
wife
or
a
former
wife?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
so
much
trouble
to
identify
needy
divorced
wives?
is
that
the
only
trouble
that
congress
is
avoiding
by
this
rule?
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
suggested
to
me
yet
any
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
needy
divorced
wife
and
the
needy
married
and
the
widow,
except
that
it
would
cost
some
money
and
maybe
it
would
cause
too
much.
i
am
not
saying
that
would
be
a
bad
reason.
but
is
there
any
other
reason
other
than
the
fact
that
it
would
just
cost
some
money
to
identify
the
needy
divorced
wives?
unknown
speaker
i
am
just
talking
about
a
needy
divorced
wife
and
you
agree
that
there
would
be
needy
divorced
wives.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
that
money
saving
basis,
i
am
not
saying
that
is
a
bad
reason
but
that
is
what
it
is
doing,
is
it
not?
it
is
saving
money
by
not
identifying
the
needy
wives.
unknown
speaker
maybe
another
way
to
put
that
would
be
either
they
are
able
of
having
a
single
pie
to
give
more
money
to
other
disabled
categories,
to
children,
to
wives,
as
distinguished
from
divorced
wives
by
drawing
that
line.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee,
before
you
sit
down,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
1965
is
the
first
time
when
any
divorced
wives
got
any
benefits
at
all?
unknown
speaker
yes,
a
divorced
wife
whose
wage
earner
was
still
living.
unknown
speaker
but
was
there
a
divorced
wife
benefit,
death
benefit
before
that
again?
unknown
speaker
mr.
brusman,
in
your
brief,
you
do
not
cite
mathews
against
lucas,
decided
last
june.
i
take
it,
do
you
feel
that
has
no,
no
bearing
on
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
your
opposition
thinks
otherwise
because
they
cited
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
brusman,
do
you
think
before
1950
when
there
was
a
scheme
of
benefits
for
wives
and
no
scheme
of
benefits
at
all
for
divorced
wives
was
the
scheme
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
does
that
not
assume
that
divorced
wives,
as
a
general
proposition
are
dependent
upon
their
husbands?
without
assumption,
don’t
you.
unknown
speaker
and
from
what
do
you
draw
that
to?
through
the
common
human
experience
or,
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
common
sense.
i
said
common
human
experience,
is
that
the
generality
of
experience?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
a
matter
of
which
we
could
take
judicial
notice
that
the
majority
of
women
who
get
divorced,
get
remarried?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know,
but
i
am
speaking
of
the
generality
of
experience,
now
you
are
making
a
general,
postulated,
a
general
proposition
that
divorced
wives
as
a
class
were
dependent
upon
their
husbands,
the
husband
from
whom
they
were
first
divorced.
unknown
speaker
and
who
was
not
remarried.
unknown
speaker
if
she
can
find
him.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
governments
figures
about
those
that
you
do
not
find?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
get
what
you
mean
by
dependants.
you
mean
a
wife
whose
husband
is
not
giving
her
any
alimony
at
all
is
dependent
on
it?
unknown
speaker
isn’t
she?
unknown
speaker
so,
she
automatically
that
just
by
getting
married
she
becomes
eligible.
unknown
speaker
if
she
marries
a
man
and
lives
with
him
20
years,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
she
is
divorced
or
not,
it
is
up
to
their—
unknown
speaker
that
the
divorced
wife
is
entitled
to
be
the
same
as
the
living
one,
as
the
un-divorced
wife.
unknown
speaker
so
once
she
has
the
child,
she
is
qualified
otherwise
she
loses.
unknown
speaker
mr.
brusman,
couldn't
you
ask
all
of
those
same
questions
with
respect
to
a
divorced
wife
with
children,
63
years
old,
but
only
been
married
19-and-a-half
years.
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
whole
variety
of
things
that
are
beyond
constitutional
that
we
hold
this
particular
category
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
but
would
you
agree
with
same
argument
applied
to
that
hypothetical
case,
wouldn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
agree
with
those
figures
or
what
if
think
we
cannot
ignore
them,
that
we
must
rely
on
them?
what
then?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
ask
you
again,
what
if
we,
do
you
think
the
facts
are
relevant?
do
you
think
the
question
is
relevant
as
to
the
proportion
of
divorced
wives
that
are
or
are
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
that
is
irrelevant
inquiry?
unknown
speaker
and
how
do
we
find
that
out,
what
the
answer
is?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
agree
with
the
secretary
as
to
what
the
percentage
is.
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
happened
to
agree
with
the
secretary
as
to
what
the
percentage
is?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
will
put
it
to
you.
what
if
we
decided,
what
if
we
thought
that
from
the
best
information
we
could
find
that
10%
of
them
were
dependent
no
more?
unknown
speaker
no,
10%
of
divorced
women
with
dependent
children
are
receiving
alimony
but
no
more.
unknown
speaker
assuming
that
the
fronteiro
figure
you
cited
from
the
footnote
of
fronteiro
is
valid,
what
inference
should
be
drawn
with
respect
then
to
people
who
are
no
longer,
women
who
are
no
longer
the
wives,
roughly
of
the
principal
social
security
accounts?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
if
i
could
make
it
any
clearer.
41%,
you
said
the
footnote
describes
as
being
employed,
not
dependent,
married
woman.
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
would
it
not
be
reasonable
for
congress
to
infer
from
that
that
they
were
not
dependent?
unknown
speaker
well
then
move
from
the
married
woman
to
the
divorced
women.
on
what
basis
would
you
assume
that
there
is
a
dependency
of
the
divorced
wives?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
that
assumption?
unknown
speaker
but
precisely
the
contrary
argument
about
involving
mothers
--dozens
of
times
here.
unknown
speaker
you
are
making
your
claim
note
today
not
as
of
1965
actually.
unknown
speaker
are
we
talking
about
benefits
now
for
a
dependent
child
or
a
divorced
wife
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
there
is
an
allowance
for
the
child.
unknown
speaker
mr.
brusman,
one
other
question.
is
it
that
your
client
could
qualify
if
she
were
a
wife
or
if
she
were
over
62,
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
even
though
she
retains
her
status
as
a
divorcer,
do
you
challenge
the
age
bracket
of
62?
unknown
speaker
what
would
be
the
needs
of
a
divorced
woman,
married
20
years
with
a
dependent
child
who
was
only
52
years
of
age?
would
that
not
be
substantially
the
same
as
the
woman
of
62?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
a
part
of
your
case,
is
it
not?
because
your
client
when
she
attains
62
will
get
these
things.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
mr.
lee,
that
if
we
have
to
conclude
erroneously,
i
am
sure
you
would
say,
that
the
divorced
wives
and
the
married
wives
with
dependent
children
in
terms
of
need
are
in
exactly
the
same
position,
you
would
be
making
your
present
argument.
unknown
speaker
so
that
your
figures
about
the
relative
need
of
these
two
groups,
you
do
not
think
are
necessary
for
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
just
sort
of
major
needs.
unknown
speaker
loss
of
earnings.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
substitute
for
earnings.
unknown
speaker
insurance
is
substitute
for
earnings.
not
measured
by
need
but
it
is
measured
by
law.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
figure
with
respect
to
alimony,
got
to
do
with
loss
of
earnings?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lee
another
example
and
just
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
in
this.
if
the
husband
should
remarry,
does
the
divorced
wife
stop
being
a
statutory
divorced
wife?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
