justice

this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
under
the
social
security
act,
a
married
woman
whose
husband
retires
or
becomes
disabled
is
granted
benefits
if
she
has
a
minor
or
dependent
child
in
her
care.
a
divorced
woman,
whose
former
husband
retires
and
becomes
disabled,
does
not
receive
such
benefits.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
difference
in
the
statutory
treatment
of
married
and
divorced
women
is
permissible
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
the
appellee,
helen
de
castro,
was
divorced
from
her
husband
in
1968
after
more
than
20
years
of
marriage.
she
cares
for
a
disabled
child
who
is
illegible
for
and
who
receives
child
insurance
benefits
under
the
act.
in
may
of
1971,
her
former
husband
applied
for
and
later
was
granted
old
age
insurance
benefits.
mrs.
de
castro
applied
for
wife
insurance
benefits
shortly
thereafter.
at
the
time
of
her
application,
she
was
56
years
old.
her
application
was
denied
by
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
because
no
wife's
benefits
are
payable
to
a
divorced
wife
under
62
even
if
she
has
a
dependent
child.
mrs.
de
castro
then
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
seeking
judicial
review
of
the
secretary's
decision.
her
complaint
alleged
that
this
provision
of
the
social
security
act
operates
to
arbitrarily
discriminate
against
divorced
wives
and
her
complaint
prayed
for
an
injunction
against
that
section's
application.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened.
the
court
considered
their
parties'
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
granted
the
relief
prayed
for
in
the
complaint,
holding
that
the
wife's
benefits
provision,
and
i'm
quoting,
"invidiously
discriminates
against
divorced
wives
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment."
we
have
concluded
that
the
district
court
was
mistaken
in
its
conclusion.
the
old
age
and
disability
insurance
aspects
of
the
social
security
system
do
not
purport
to
be
general
public
assistance
laws
that
simply
pay
money
to
those
who
needed
most.
that
was
not
the
predominant
purpose
of
these
benefit
provisions
when
they
were
enacted
or
when
they
were
amended,
rather,
the
primary
objective
was
to
provide
workers
and
their
families
with
basic
protection
against
hardships
created
by
the
laws
of
earnings
due
to
illness
or
old
age.
in
view
of
the
legislative
purpose,
the
congressional
judgment
was
hardly
an
irrational
one.
divorce
by
its
nature
works
a
drastic
change
in
the
economic
and
personal
relationship
between
a
husband
and
wife.
congress
could
have
rationally
assumed
that
divorced
husbands
and
wives
depend
less
on
each
other
for
financial
and
other
support
than
do
couples
who
stay
married.
the
problems
that
a
divorced
wife
may
encounter
when
her
former
husband
becomes
old
or
disabled
may
well
defer
in
kind
and
in
degree
from
those
that
a
woman
married
to
retired
or
disabled
husband
must
face.
in
short,
divorced
couples
typically
lives
separate
lives.
it
was
not
irrational
for
congress
to
recognize
this
basic
fact
in
deciding
to
defer
monthly
payments
to
divorced
wives
of
retired
or
disabled
wage
earners
until
they
reach
the
age
of
62.
in
any
event,
the
constitutional
question
is
not
whether
a
statutory
provision
precisely
filters
out
those
and
only
those
who
are
in
a
factual
position
which
generated
the
congressional
concern
reflected
in
the
statute.
for
the
reasons,
i
have
summarized,
spelled
out
in
greater
detail
in
the
court's
written
opinion.
we
conclude
that
the
statutory
classifications
involved
in
this
case
are
not
of
such
an
order
as
to
infringe
upon
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
accordingly,
the
judgement
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
marshall
concurs
only
in
the
court's
judgment.
