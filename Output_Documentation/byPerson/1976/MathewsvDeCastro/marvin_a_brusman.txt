mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
revolves
around
the
constitutionality
of
section
202(b)(1)(b)
of
the
social
security
act.
that
section
creates
two
classes
of
women.
the
first
class
is
composed
of
wives
under
age
62
with
dependent
children
in
their
care
to
whom
benefits
are
granted.
the
second
class
is
composed
of
wives
who
have
secured
divorces
after
at
least
20
years
of
marriage
who
are
also
under
age
62
and
who
also
have
dependent
children
of
the
marriage
in
their
care.
to
this
group
no
social
security
benefits
are
granted.
and
the
question
that
arises
is
whether
this
different
treatment
of
married
wives
and
divorced
wives
with
dependent
children
in
their
care
under
age
62
is
justified.
thus,
the
line
that
congress
has
drawn
between
married
wives
and
divorced
wives
with
entitled
children
bear
some
rationale
relationship
to
legitimate
legislative
purpose.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
becomes
very
important
for
this
court
to
determine
what
the
purpose
of
this
provision
of
section
202(b)(1)(b)
is.
i
submit
that
the
purpose
of
that
provision
is
to
facilitate
parental
care
for
dependent
children
by
enabling
mothers
to
remain
at
home
and
care
for
those
children.
i
think
this
purpose
is
clear
when
you
examine
section
202(b)(1)(b).
it
provides
first
of
all,
benefits
to
wives
and
divorced
wives
upon
attaining
age
62
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
have
children
in
their
care.
but
a
young
wife,
under
age
62
is
given
benefits
only
if
she
has
a
dependent
child
in
her
care.
the
young
wife
who
does
not
have
a
dependent
child
in
her
care
receives
no
benefits
until
she
attains
age
62.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
congress
were
concerned
solely
for
the
welfare
of
the
wife,
there
would
be
no
necessity
to
condition
her
eligibility
for
benefits
upon
the
presence
of
a
child
in
her
care.
evidently,
congress
was
concerned
not
with
the
welfare
of
the
wife
herself
but
for
the
child
that
she
bore
responsibility
for.
moreover,
if
you
look
at
the
provisions
that
terminate
the
benefits
that
are
paid
to
a
wife
with
a
child
in
her
care,
you
see
that
the
benefits
cease
when
the
benefits
that
are
paid
to
a
child
cease.
in
other
words,
the
wives
benefits
are
linked
to
the
child’s
benefits
and
are
paid
only
so
long
as
it
was
realistic
to
think
that
the
child
would
need
his
mother's
care.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
well,
the
standard
for
testing
the
constitutionality
of
congressional
legislation,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
classification
drawn
by
congress
has
to
bear
a
relationship
to
a
legitimate
legislative
purpose
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
identify
that
purpose
and
to
see
whether
the
classification
drawn
relates
to
it.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
not
really,
because
in
1939,
benefits
were
first
provided
for
wives
as
a
class
and
then
in
1950,
they
were
provided
to
wives
with
children
in
their
care
and
it
seems
that
the
history
is
the
problem
that
the
benefits
that
were
finally
accorded
to
divorced
wives
did
not
begin
until
1965.
i
think
the
purpose
of
providing
benefits
to
a
wife
with
a
child
in
her
care
was
enacted
or
thought
of,
back
in
1950
when
benefits
were
first
accorded
to
wives
with
children.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
well,
that
purpose
had
not
changed.
there
has
not
been
any
change
in
that
section
of
202(b)(1)(b).
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
do.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
apparently.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
no,
i
do
not
think
it
was.
but
once
congress
recognized
that
divorced
wives
have
the
same
need
for
benefits
and
perhaps
just
as
dependent
upon
their
former
husbands
as
the
wives
are
concerned,
once
they
make
that
recognition
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
provisions
such
as
we
have
here
are
unconstitutional.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
say
that
they
are
at
least
equally
dependent
upon
their
former
husbands
as
wives
are
on
their
husbands.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
would
draw
that
from
common
sense,
yes.
and
i—
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
it
seems
to
me
that
a
woman—
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
well,
one
of
the
conditions
for
eligibility
under
section
202(b)(1)(b)
is
that
she
not
be—
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
well,
based
on
my
experience,
it
is
not
really
a
divorced
wife
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
we
are
talking
about
a
divorced
wife
who
was
married
at
least
20
years
prior
to
her
divorce
and
who
has
children
of
that
marriage
in
her
care.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
and
who
was
not
remarried.
and
it
is
that
person
that
is
just
as
likely
to
be
dependent
upon
her
husband
as
the
wife.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
if
she
can
find
it,
but
that
was
one
of
the
problem.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
it
still
does
not
change
their
degree
of
dependence.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
well,
the
dependence
--
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
think
the
dependence
exists
if
she
cannot
find
the
husband,
she
has
to
find
some
other
source
of
income
to
survive.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
or
if
she
remarries,
she
becomes
ineligible
for
benefits
under
this
under
this
section?
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
had
followed
what
you
are
pointing
out.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
as
long
as
she
has
a
child
in
her
care.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
she
can
lose
it
if
she
remarries.
if
the
child
becomes
ineligible
for
benefits,
then
she
loses
it
as
well.
from
an
examination
of
the
structure
of
section
202(b)(1)(b)
of
the
social
security
act,
i
submit
respectfully
that
the
purpose
of
that
section
is
to
allow
a
mother
to
remain
at
home
and
care
for
her
child.
and
given
that
purpose,
the
question
then
becomes
what
justification
exists
for
excluding
divorced
wives
and
their
children
from
the
statutes
coverage?
why
should
a
divorced
wife,
who
was
married
at
least
20
years
prior
to
her
divorce
be
denied
benefits
in
preference
to
a
wife
who
has
not
been
divorced.
why
should
a
wife
who
has
separated
from
her
husband
be
granted
benefits
and
the
divorced
wife
not.
and
why
should
children
of
divorced
parents
not
have
the
same
opportunity
for
their
parent’s
fulltime
parent
attention
that
is
afforded
to
the
children
of
married
parents.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
its
true,
but
we
are
not—
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
but
the
question
in
this
case
isn’t
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
would
believe
so.
a
mother
is
afforded
the
opportunity
of
staying
home
with
her
child.
a
divorced
mother
must
forego
that
opportunity.
benefits
that
congress
thought
were
essential
for
the
proper
care
and
supervision
of
the
children
of
wage
earners
are
denied
simply
because
of
the
mother’s
marital
status.
and
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
mother
is
married,
separated
or
divorced,
i
submit
it
does
not
make
any
difference
and
that
is
why
this
exclusion
of
divorced
wives
from
the
statutes
coverage
is
irrational.
the
secretary
has
argued
that
there
is
a
rationale
basis
for
this
statute.
he
argues
first
of
all
that
wives
as
a
class
are
substantially
more
likely
to
be
dependent
upon
their
husbands
than
divorced
wives
and
are
thus
likely
to
suffer
a
loss
of
support
when
the
husband
becomes
disabled
or
retires.
the
basis
for
that
statement
are
two
surveys,
a
1925
survey
and
a
1975
survey,
that
he
cites
in
his
brief
and
the
citation
states
that
only
14%
of
divorced
women
receive
alimony.
it
is
important,
i
think
to
reflect
upon
what
we
are
not
told
by
those
statistics.
we
do
not
know
the
percentage
of
divorced
women
with
children
who
receive
alimony.
we
do
not
know
the
percentage
of
divorced
women
who
have
been
married
at
least
20
years
prior
to
their
divorce
and
who
have
children
in
their
care
who
receive
alimony.
we
do
not
know
the
percentage
of
divorced
women
who
perhaps
--
they
do
not
receive
support
in
the
form
of
alimony,
do
receive
in
the
form
of
child
support
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
will
be
a
much
higher
percentage
of
divorced
women
receiving
alimony
among
those
women
who
were
divorced
after
20
years
of
marriage
with
dependent
children
in
their
care
and
so
the
conclusion
that
the
secretary
draws
that
wives
are
more
dependent
than
divorced
wives
upon
the
wage
earner
really
has
no
foundation,
because
both
groups
are
going
to
be
equally
dependent.
i
have
no
figures
to
cite
to
you.
the
only
figures
the
secretary
has
are
two
from
a
1925
and
a
1975
survey.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
could
not
have
relied
on
those
figures
in
enacting
this
legislation.
a
1925
survey
was
many
years
prior
to
the
time
that
came
into
law,
1975
survey
occurred
after
this
had
already
been
passed.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
think
the
relevant
inquiry
is
the
percentage
of
divorced
wives
with
children
in
their
care
that
receive
the
alimony
as
opposed
to
--
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
yes.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
think
you
can
base,
you
can
make
some
assumptions
based
on
personal
experience.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
pardon
me?
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
again,
i
just
do
not
think
that
figure
is
the
relevant
inquiry.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
10%
of
what?
divorced
women?
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
and
if
the
same
percentage
of
married
wives
with
children
were
dependent
upon
their
husbands
then
i
think
the
statistics
would
be
relevant.
we
do
not
know
the
percentage
of
married
wives
with
children
that
are
dependent
upon
their
husbands,
in
fact
this
court,
in
the
fronteiro
decision
noted
on
a
footnote
that
41.5%
of
all
married
woman
were
employed.
and
you
commented
that
the
presumption
of
dependency
of
wives
upon
their
wage
earners
does
not
bear
any
relation
to
present
day
reality.
and
so,
it
seems
to
me,
you
just
cannot
presume
that
one
group
is
dependent
and
then
slight
statistics
show
that
another
group
is
to
--
either
have
to
make
presumptions
in
both
cases
or
have
statistics
in
both
case.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
whether
or
not
they
are
dependent,
we
do
not
know.
all
we
know
is
the
figure
of
the
percentage
that
is
employed.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
they
could
infer.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
again,
i
have
no
figures
to
cite
to
you.
but,
you
have
to
understand
that
we
deal
here
with
a
woman
divorced
after
20
years
of
marriage
who
has
a
dependent
child
in
her
care.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
is
the
child
in
her
care
that
is
going
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
is
employed
or
whether
not
she
is
dependent.
the
assumption
is
that
a
woman
with
a
child
or
children
in
her
care
is
going
to
be
at
home
taking
care
of
that
child.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
based
on
what
the
normal
role
of
the
wife
has
been
in
our
society
for
many
years,
although
it
is
changing
now.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
realize
that
but
this
legislation
was
drawn
at
a
time
when
the
wife
was
traditionally
the
parent
who
remained
at
home
and
took
care
of
the
child.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
that
is
true.
but
it
seems
to
me
go
back
and
look
at
what
the
purpose
was
in
giving
benefits
to
wives
with
children.
and
if
that
takes
aback
before
1965,
so
be
it.
the
problem
dealt
with
by
this
portion
of
the
statute
again,
i
submit
is
the
needs
of
dependent
children.
those
needs
exist
regardless
of
whether
the
child’s
mother
is
married,
separated
or
divorced.
the
need
of
children
of
divorced
parents
is
no
less
than
the
need
of
children
of
married
parents
and
the
need
in
each
case
is
the
same
and
should
be
satisfied
for
all,
by
affording
benefits.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
the
benefits
are
paid
to
the
wife
but
the
ultimate
beneficiary,
it
seems
to
me
is
the
child
that
she
is
taking
care
of.
they
are
paid
to
her
so
that
she
can
remain
at
home
and
give
that
child
the
care,
the
congress
apparently
felt
was
very
necessary.
and
having
recognized
a
need
among
young
and
disabled
children
for
their
--
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
there
is
and
there
is
an
allowance
for
the
child
if
the
mother
is
married,
there
is
no
distinction
as
far
as
that
is
concern.
having
recognized
a
need
among
young
and
disabled
children
for
maternal
care,
and
having
determined
to
fulfill
that
need
by
granting
benefits
to
wives
who
can
provide
that
care.
it
is
entirely
irrational
for
congress
then
to
exclude
divorced
wives
and
their
children
from
the
statute's
coverage.
the
divorce
of
the
mother
does
not
change
the
needs
for
benefits.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
if
she
were
wife,
she
would
be
eligible
for
benefits
now
and
upon
attaining
the
age
62,
she
also
becomes
eligible.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
no,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we
are
only
dealing
with
wives
with
children
in
their
care
and
divorced
wives
with
children
in
their
care
under
age
62.
the
social
security
act
is
designed
to
pay
benefits
in
accordance
with
the
probable
needs
of
its
beneficiaries.
to
sustain
this
legislation,
it
seems
to
me
this
court
has
to
conclude
the
needs
of
children
of
divorced
parents
are
less
than
the
needs
of
children
of
other
parents.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
i
think
the
needs
would
be
the
same.
mr.
marvin
a.
brusman
well,
she
will
be
getting
these
benefits.
the
relevant
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is,
under
age
62
wives
with
children
in
their
care
receive
benefits,
divorced
wives
in
the
same
situation
do
not
receive
any
benefits,
and
yet
the
needs
are
exactly
the
same
although,
i
do
not
have
any
statistics
to
give
the
court.
married
and
divorced
mothers
with
children
that
have
similar
needs
are
treated
differently
by
this
section
without
any
rationale
justification
and
absence
of
rational
justification
for
the
different
treatment,
i
submit
that
this
section
violates
the
equal
protection
guarantees
implicit
in
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
clause.
and
accordingly,
i
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
