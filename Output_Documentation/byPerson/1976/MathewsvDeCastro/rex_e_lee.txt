mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
in
separate
enactments,
over
the
period
from
1939-1958,
congress
has
gradually
expanded
the
social
security
entitlements
of
wage
earner’s
wives.
so
that
as
of
1958,
the
wife
of
a
wage
earner
with
an
entitled
child
in
her
care,
may
obtain
benefits
without
regard
or
age
when
the
wage
earner
becomes
entitled
to
primary
benefits
on
his
own
account.
also
overtime,
though
for
quite
different
reasons,
congress
has
expanded
and
it
is
extended
secondary
benefits
to
certain
categories
of
divorced
wives,
including
a
provision
that
is
involved
in
this
case
in
1965,
that
divorced
wives
defined
as
those
who
were
married
to
their
husbands
for
a
period
of
20
years
or
more
prior
to
the
divorce,
are
entitled
to
secondary
benefits
at
the
time
that
the
wage
earner
becomes
entitled
to
primary
benefits,
provided
that
they
have
reached
age
62.
so
that
prior
to
age
62
wives
but
not
divorced
wives,
are
entitled
to
receive
secondary
benefits
on
the
basis
of
entitled
children
in
their
care.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
not.
at
least,
should
that
be
fairly
all,
she
would
have
been
married
to
two
of
them
for
a
period
of
20
years.
as
i
read
the
legislative
history
that
was
the
purpose
of
that
20
year
requirement.
i
suppose
it
would
be
conceivably
possible
just
as
the
wives
being
plus
21
years,
results
of
the
possibilities
of
the
fertile
octogenarian,
but
that
would
be
rare.
the
appellee
in
this
case,
helen
de
castro
was
divorced
from
albert
de
castro
in
february
of
1968
after
more
than
20
years
of
marriage.
the
divorce
decree
did
not
award
her
alimony.
some
three
years
later,
after
her
ex-husband
became
eligible
for
primary
benefits,
mrs.
de
castro
applied
for
wives
benefits
on
mr.
de
castro’s
account.
she
was
then
56
years
old
and
had
in
her
care,
a
22
year
old
disabled
daughter.
the
daughter
was
entitled
to
and
continues
to
receive
child’s
insurance
benefits
because
of
mr.
de
castro’s
social
security
earnings
record.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
administrative
process,
the
secretary
determined
that
mrs.
de
castro
was
not
entitled
to
benefits,
she
there
upon
brought
suit,
contending
with
section
202(b)(1)(b)
of
the
act
unconstitutionally
discriminates
against
divorced
wives.
the
three-judge
court
ruled
in
her
favor
and
this
appeal
followed.
the
key
to
the
disposition
of
this
case
we
submit
is
contained
in
two
interrelated
considerations.
the
first
is
the
history
of
the
statutory
provisions
in
which
congress
over
a
period
of
some
three
decades
has
gradually
but
continually
expanded
the
secondary
insurance
benefits
available
to
wives
and
divorced
wives,
each
with
its
separate
rationale,
with
a
single
over
arching
rationale
in
the
case
of
wives
to
benefit
the
family,
but
with
the
subsidiary
rationale
applicable
to
most
of
the
individual
ones.
the
second
dispositive
consideration
is
the
constitutional
standard
which
congress
has
held
in
performing
its
policy
making
function
of
allocating
scarce
social
insurance
resources.
i
would
like
to
address
each
of
these
separately.
first,
the
history
of
the
relevant
statutory
provisions.
the
controlling
feature
of
the
legislative
history
is
that
the
secondary
benefits
to
which
wives
and
divorced
wives
are
entitled
did
not
result
from
a
single
legislative
enactment
but
rather
over
a
period
of
some
30
years,
congress
has
incrementally
expanded
these
benefits
with
the
history
of
each
edition,
clearly
disclosing
a
proper
objective
but
in
no
case
that
the
rationale
for
the
particular
enlargement
of
secondary
insurance
benefits
to
the
wife
equally
embraced,
the
class
of
divorced
wives
to
which
the
appellee
belongs.
when
originally
enacted
in
1935,
the
social
security
act
provided
only
primary
benefits
to
the
wage
earner
himself.
the
first
expansion
of
secondary
benefits
occurred
in
1939,
it
was
a
general
expansion
it
had
a
general
purpose.
that
purpose
was
very
clearly
set
forth
in
the
legislative
history
and
resided
by
this
court
as
dispositive
of
the
issue
in
weinberger
v.
weisenfeld
and
it
was
to
afford
more
adequate
protection
to
the
family
as
a
unit.
in
addition,
on
relevant
to
this
case,
the
1939
amendments
contained
the
first
instance
of
extension
of
benefits
on
an
account
of
an
entitled
child
in
the
care
of
either
a
wife
or
ex-wife.
it
was
a
narrow
extension,
it
was
made
only
to
widows
who
had
reached
either
age
65
or
had
an
entitled
child
in
their
care.
once
again,
there
was
a
precise
rationale
for
this
particular
extension
in
addition
to
the
general
family
protection
that
was
applicable
to
the
entire
package
of
1939
secondary
benefits.
again
this
was
quoted
in
the
weisenfeld
opinion
and
it
was
that
congress
wanted
to
give
the
child
deprived
of
one
parent,
in
this
case
through
death,
the
opportunity
for
the
person
with
detention
of
the
other.
from
1939-1950,
there
was
no
change
in
the
eligibility
provisions
for
wives
or
widows.
in
1950,
congress
extended
the
entitled
child
eligibility
to
the
wife
of
a
retired,
whereas
prior
to
that
time
it
had
only
been
diseased,
wage
earner.
the
rationale
was
not
the
same
as
it
was
in
1939
because
the
wife
unlike
the
widow
is
not
faced
with
the
choice
of
either
foregoing
income
or
leaving
the
child
unattended
all
together
because
her
husband
is
not
dead,
but
retirement
in
the
usual
case
means
income
reduction.
extension
of
this
benefit
reduced
the
lead
for
major
adjustments
in
the
family
patterns
and
the
normal
family
relations
coming
at
a
time
late
in
the
wage
earners
life.
eight
years
later,
in
1958,
benefits
were
extended
to
the
wife
of
a
disabled
wage
earner
with
an
entitled
child
in
her
care.
so
that
as
of
1958,
we
have
all
of
the
grounds
covered,
diseased,
disabled
or
retired.
once
again,
the
rationale
for
extension
to
the
disabled,
to
the
wife
of
a
disabled
wage
earner
with
an
entitled
child
in
her
care
was
tailored
to
the
particular
extension,
as
the
house
committee
report
observes
the
child
of
a
disabled
wage
earner
will
usually
be
younger
than
the
child
of
a
retired
wage
earner
with
correspondingly
greater
need
to
permit
the
mother
to
remain
at
home,
and
the
house
may
report
further
observes
that
a
person
receiving
disability
insurance
benefits,
frequently
has
high
medical
expenses
with
attendant
diminution
on
the
family
income.
each
of
these
extensions
of
secondary
benefits
to
wives
or
widows
on
account
of
entitled
children
in
their
care
was
bottomed
on
a
distinct
but
very
proper
rationale.
there
is
one
unifying
feature
to
the
three,
and
it
is
that
each
rationale
promoted
in
some
way
more
adequate
protection
to
the
family
as
a
unit.
neither
this
general
objective
of
affording
protection
to
the
family
as
a
unit,
nor
the
more
precisely
identified
objectives
of
the
1939,
1950
and
1958
amendments
has
any
relevance
to
divorced
wives.
in
the
normal
case,
divorce
works
a
fundamental
and
enduring
change
not
only
on
family
relationships
but
also
on
the
financial
dependents
of
one
divorced
spouse
on
the
other.
the
kinds
of
impact—
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well
i
assume
not
mr.
justice
white,
but
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
certainly
that
under
the
broad
discretion
that
this
court
has
afforded
to
congress
in
its
recent
decision
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
congress
could
have
taken
into
account.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
certainly
know
this
at
a
minimum
that
in
1939,
when
the
initial
extension
was
made
that
the
thing
that
congress
was
attempting
to
afford
more
adequate
protection
for
the
family
as
a
unit.
we
know
that
in
1958
they
had
family
internal
ongoing
family
relationships
in
mind,
because
of
the
observation
that
family
income
would
be
reduced
because
of
disability.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
best
figures
that
we
have
are
those
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
they
indicate
that
only
about
14%
of
divorced
wives
are
entitled
alimony
by
virtue
of
the
decree.
and
about
45%
of
those
14%
actually
receive
it
so
we
are
down
to
around
6.5%.
significance
of
that
fact
of
course
is
this.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
really
do
not
know.
there
is
nothing
in
reports,
so
to
indicate.
but
the
point
is,
what
you
really
come
down
to
then
is
the
question
of
how
much
leeway
do
we
give
to
congress
in
making
these
kinds
of
judgments.
you
do
have
the
problem
with
the
6.5%
of
the
over
inclusiveness
or
the
under
inclusiveness,
the
same
kind
of
problem
that
this
court
faced
in
salfi,
the
same
kind
of
problem
that
this
court
faced
just
six
months
ago
in
the
lucas
case,
in
dandridge
v.
williams,
the
court
said
that
congress
is
entitled
to
face
these
problems
one
at
a
time
and
manifestly,
when
you
have
a
program
that
is
designed
to
handle
the
problems
of
tens
of
millions
of
people
with
desperate
requirements
and
desperate
circumstances,
there
are
going
to
be
some
ragged
edges,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
observed
in
his
separate
opinion
cramer
v.
union
police
school
district.
that
kind
of
imperfection
is
part
of
the
inevitable
consequence
of
line
drawing.
you
always
have
some
instances
in
which
congress
does
not
and
indeed
cannot
exactly
tailor
its
program
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
anomaly
or
inequity.
and
if
there
is
any
message
that
comes
out
of
salfi
and
lucas,
and
dandridge
v.
williams,
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
rationale
basis
which
congress
could
have
taken
into
account
but
that
is
proper.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
the
problem
that
congress
is
avoiding
this
approach
mr.
justice
white
is
that,
congress’
bag
of
funds
is
limited.
and
it
can
solve
only
one
problem
at
a
time.
i
might
disagree,
in
fact,
by
the
time
you
take
into
account
the
number
of
variables
with
which
congress
has
to
deal,
divorce
status
as
opposed
to
non-divorce
status,
age,
dependency,
and
you
could
go
on
for
about
five
or
six.
and
then
you
consider
all
of
the
different
combinations
that
can
enter
in.
there
is
no
circumstance
in
which
someone
cannot
(inaudible)
what
congress
has
done
and
say
you
made
a
mistake.
but
you
should
have
allocated
more
money
in
this
instance
rather
than
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes
there
is.
if
you
concentrate
on
that
question
and
incidentally
that
is
the
question
that
the
lower
court
concentrated
on
and
i
think
that
was
the
root
error
of
the
lower
court
and
you
ask
only
the
question
“are
divorced
wives
more
needy
or
less
needy
than
wives?
then
i
think
you
might
make
a
fairly
good
case
with
the
proposition
that
divorced
wives
in
fact
are
as
needy
as
a
group.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
indeed
i
do.
but
that
does
not
render
the
statute
unconstitutional
because
probably
the
neediest
of
all
in
our
society
or
probably
not
divorced
wives,
nor
wives
but
probably
orphans
who
have
no
parents
at
all
to
take
care
of
them.
but
the
point
is
that
congress
so
long
as
it
acts
on
a
reasonable
basis.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
by
going
as
this
court
said
that
they
were
entitled
to
precede
one
step
at
a
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
and
there
are
at
least
three
differences.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you
mr.
justice
white.
there
are
at
least
three
differences
between
wives
in
this
context,
and
divorced
wives,
all
of
which
fall
within
the
broad
egis
or
protection
of
the
family
as
a
unit
and
some
of
which
very
specifically
were
identified
by
congress
as
constituting
part
of
its
basis
which
congress
could
rationally
take
into
account
in
making
the
decision
that
it
did
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
death,
retirement
or
disability
for
the
wage
earner
has
an
effect
on
the
family
income
in
the
usual
case.
in
the
usual
divorce
situation,
this
is
not
true.
in
6.5%
of
the
cases,
it
is
but
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
lucas
held
that
congress
may
make
distinctions
based
on
the
relative
livelihood
of
dependency.
in
that
case
it
was
legitimates
versus
illegitimates,
here
it
is
wives
dependency
versus
divorced
wives
dependency.
the
second
difference
is
that
there
is
a
living
benefit
to
the
wage
earner,
in
that
secondary
insurance
to
members
of
his
family
increases
the
family
income
and
does
so
at
the
time
that
there
is
a
reduction
in
the
overall
family
income.
and
finally,
the
payment
of
benefits
to
the
wife
minimizes
the
extent
to
which
the
family’s
normal
routine
must
be
disrupted
by
the
wage
earners
termination
of
his
employment,
which
was
the
precise
factor
that
congress
mentioned
at
the
time
that
it
enacted
the
1958
edition.
the
problems
of
divorced
wives
mr.
justice
white
are
not
to
be
denied
but
the
disadvantages
under
which
their
labor
are
created
by
the
fact
of
divorce
and
not
by
the
social
security
program.
the
aspects
of
impact
on
the
family
from
death,
retirement
or
disability
with
which
congress
was
attempting
to
deal
in
this
incremental
program
which
had
enacted
are
simply
lacking
in
the
divorce
context.
the
fact
that
her
ex-husband
has
reached
retirement
has
no
effect
on
the
extent
of
mrs.
de
castro’s
need.
therefore,
unlike
weisenfeld,
for
example,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
event
that
triggered
the
particular
benefit
to
one
class
but
not
another
is
an
event
that
is
accompanied
by
some
hardship
on
the
non-receiving
class.
the
final
observation
that
i
would
like
to
make
and
i
will
reserve
some
time
is
that
even
if
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
were
not
as
clear
as
it
is,
and
while
congress
did
not
cover
all
the
basis,
we
submit
the
reasons
that
we
just
discussed
and
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
that
under
the
consistent
rulings
of
this
court
un-clarity
as
to
whether
congress
has
chosen
a
proper
purpose
or
an
improper
purpose
works
to
the
benefit,
rather
than
to
the
detriment
of
the
statute,
because
under
the
consistent
rulings
of
this
court,
the
purpose
of
statutory
interpretation
is
to
save
and
not
to
destroy.
it
would,
we
submit,
be
a
gross
distortion
of
this
principle,
to
ascribe
to
congress,
a
purpose
that
it
did
not
have
but
that
would
raise
serious
constitutional
questions,
especially
when
both
congress
and
this
court
had
made
it
so
clear
that
the
focus
of
these
provisions
is
the
protection
of
the
family,
it
is
as
mr.
justice
powell
observed
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
weisenfeld,
social
security
is
designed
certainly
in
this
context,
for
the
protection
of
the
family.
that
was
the
over
riding
consideration
at
the
time
that
congress
first
got
in
to
the
business
of
extending
secondary
insurance,
social
insurance
benefits
in
1939,
it
has
been
the
single
over
arching
purpose
since
that
time
and
every
subsidiary
rationale
is
consistent
with
it.
the
one
item
that
remains
for
discussion
in
the
course
of
this
legislative
history
is
the
history
of
the
one
provision,
in
1965
that
extended
secondary
benefits
to
the
divorced
wife
whose
husband
or
who's
wage
earner,
ex-husband
is
not
diseased.
here
again,
the
legislative
history
is
very
precise
and
it
reveals
that
congress
intended
to
handle
or
to
take
care
of
one
problem,
and
one
problem
only.
it
might
be
said
or
one
of
the
purpose
might
have
been
generally
to
provide
for
needy
divorced
wives,
or
to
provide
for
the
children
of
needy
divorced
wives,
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
1965
amendment.
the
legislative
history
on
this
matter
is
very
precise
and
i
quote
“it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
marriage
to
end
in
divorce
after
many
years,
when
the
wife
is
too
old
to
build
up
a
social
security
earnings
record
even
if
she
can
find
a
job”.
very
narrow
problem
and
that
is
the
narrow
problem
which
congress
dealt,
and
that
is
one
of
the
two
reasons,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
the
20
year
requirement.
the
one
was
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
multiple
claimant
situation
and
the
other
was
to
take
care
of
the
situation
in
which
a
couple
are
married
for
many
years
and
at
the
conclusion
of
that
marriage,
the
wife
is
simply
too
old
even
if
she
could
find
a
job
to
get
back
into
the
market
and
build
up
a
social
security
earnings
record
on
her
own
account.
consequently
it
was
the
wife,
the
older
divorced
wife
who
was
the
focus
of
the
1965
amendment
and
not
the
child.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
in
1950,
it
was
extended
to
what
they
call
“mother’s
benefits”,
in
the
case
of
a
divorced
wife
whose
wage
earner,
ex-husband
was
dead
and
there
were
three
requirements,
one
was
that
she
have
an
entitled
child
in
her
care,
second
was
that
the
wage
earner
be
dead
and
the
third
was
that
she
show
a
certain
major
dependency.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
was.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
none.
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
if
i
may
just
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
with
regard
to
mathews
v.
lucas,
i
can
understand
the
appellee’s
reluctance
to
discuss
this
case
we
submit
that
it
is
dispositive
for
at
least
two
reasons.
one
is,
that
it
is
bare
whole
of
thing
amounts
to
nothing
less
in
the
proposition
that
congress
is
entitled
to
make
distinctions
based
upon
the
relative
likelihood
of
dependency.
in
that
case,
legitimacy
versus
illegitimacy,
in
this
case
wives
who
are
dependent
on
their
wage
earner
husbands
as
opposed
to
divorced
wives
or
whom
the
alimony
picture
is
rather
rebelling
as
it
has
been
set
forth
in
the
statistics.
the
second
significance
perhaps
goes
to
an
even
more
fundamental
point.
and
it
is
that
as
i
read
lucas,
it
contains
a
reaffirmation
of
the
principle
that
if
there
is
un-clarity
in
the
statute,
and
its
history
as
to
what
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is,
you
do
not
describe
to
it.
that
un-clarity
works
to
the
benefit
of
the
statute
and
not
to
his
detriment,
that
it
does
not
result
in
ascribing
to
the
statute,
a
purpose
will
declare
it
unconstitutional
and
specifically,
in
mathews
v.
lucas,
the
root
error
of
the
lower
court
was
the
same
root
error
in
this
court
and
that
is
that
that
court
concluded
that
that
act
was
not
intended
to
merely
replace
actual
support
of
the
child
lost
but
also
obligations
to
support
or
potential
support.
here
we
have
the
lower
court,
grounding
its
decision
on
an
error
that
with
all
due
respect
my
opponent
has
consistently
repeated
here
this
afternoon
and
that
is,
the
assumption
that
our
social
insurance
program
is
based
on
need.
and
it
simply
is
not
and
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
this
statute,
and
indeed
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
overall
program
of
social
insurance
that
the
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
exactly
right.
that
is
exactly
right!
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
no.
they
entered
into
the
rationality
of
what
congress
did
in
acting
in
the
interest
of
the
family.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
they
do
it
in
the
particular
context
of—
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
right.
and
that
impact
in
the
family
because
bear
in
mind
mr.
justice
white,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
program
of
social
insurance.
insurance,
it
is
a
substitute
for
insurance,
so
that
--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
right,
and
certainly—
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
right
and
certainly
one
of
the
things
that
congress
could
take
into
account
is
what
the
wage
earner,
the
kind
of
insurance
that
he
would
buy
if
he
were
rather
than
having
this
money
taken
out
of
his
pay
check
and
having
insurance
but
foring
the
kind
of
insurance
that
he
would
buy
for
himself.
and
certainly
he
would
provide
in
the
usual
case
for
his
family
rather
than
non
members
of
the
family.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
loss
depends
on
the
wage
earner.
and
a
different
basis
that
is
applicable
to
the
family
unit
because
of
the
loss
of
dependence
on
the
wage
earner,
which
does
not
exist
in
the
non-family
context,
and
that
brings
me
to
the
proposition
that
i
looked
to
very
only
tangentially
earlier,
and
the
point
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stevens
was
making,
and
that
is
that
here,
unlike
weisenfeld,
you
have
really
a
list
of
possible
interrelating
considerations
that
could
enter
in
the
congress’s
deliberations,
age,
widow
had
her
survivorship,
the
relationship
to
the
wage
earner,
dependency,
the
time
the
marriage
endured
and
whether
there
were
entitled
children
in
her
care.
every
one
of
those
is
a
variable,
and
if
you
make
your
determination
rest
solely
upon
need,
then
virtually
the
entire
statutory
scheme
has
to
fall
because
as
my
opponent
has
conceded
and
indeed
must
concede,
the
need
of
one
who
has
been
married
19
years
by
hypothesis
will
be
just
as
great
as
the
one
who
has
been
married
20
years
and
one
month.
the
need
of
mrs.
de
castro
does
not
increase
the
day
that
she
turns
62.
and
similarly,
again
the
relevance
to
mr.
justice
white
of
the
support
figures,
in
all
that
6
5%
of
the
case,
the
need
does
not
increase
when
the
husband
dies.
so
that
if
the
focus
is
just
on
number
one,
an
assumed
purpose,
and
number
two,
a
purpose
that
is
not
in
fact
the
purpose,
the
congress
had
in
mind,
then
the
attack
on
the
statute
will
reach
all
across
as
of
many-many
of
its
aspects.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
she
does
not,
she
does
not.
so
long
as
she
satisfies
the
20
year
requirement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
as
long
as
she
satisfy
the
20
year
requirement.
all
of
which
leads
to
the
proposition
that
the
only
legal
issue
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
is
the
same
legal
issue
that
the
court
first
considered
in
nebbia
v.
new
york,
that
it
has
thankfully
reaffirmed
in
williamson
v.
lee
optical,
in
salfi,
and
in
mathews
v.
lucas
that
in
the
area
of
allocation
of
scarce
social
insurance
resources
as
in
the
area
of
economic
regulation,
so
long
as
congress
cannot
be
clearly
identified
to
have
relied
to
an
improper
purpose
as
it
did
in
weisenfeld,
and
so
long
it
has
not
discriminated,
as
it
has
not
done
in
this
case,
then
those
policy
judgments
in
allocating
scarce
resources
for
social
insurance,
rest
within
the
sound
discretion
of
congress.
under
that
standard,
it
is
very
clear,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
must
be
reversed.
