mr.

are
ready.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brusman,
in
order
to
prevail
on
your
argument,
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
have
to
first
pick
out
a
purpose
that
to
identify
that
congress
was
shooting
at
and
then
in
effect
conclude
that
it
missed.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
identifying
the
purpose,
you
necessarily
have
to
take
the
position
that
congress
had
a
purpose
in
mind
but
some
of
them
misfired,
somewhere
between
adopting
that
purpose
and
getting
a
law
passed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
say
we
must
conclude
that
each
time
congress
amended
the
act,
it
had
the
same
purpose
in
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
brusman.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
lee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
mathews,
the

of
health,
education
and
welfare

de
castro

announced

justice
stewart.
