mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
federal
income
tax
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
claims
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
two
cases,
consumer
life
and
penn
security
are
from
the
court
of
claims
and
the
first
railroad
cases
from
the
fifth
circuit.
they
present
a
common
question
whether
these
taxpayer
insurance
companies
meet
the
definition
of
a
life
insurance
company
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
our
tax
system
provides
a
marked
preference
for
our
life
insurance
companies
insofar
that
it
grants
them
a
narrow
tax
base.
the
court
had
previously
considered
the
effect
of
that
narrow
tax
base
about
ten
years
ago
in
the
atlas
life
insurance
company
case.
now,
other
stock
insurance
companies
such
as
those
engaged
in
the
sale
of
non-life
insurance
such
as
cancelable
accident
and
health
or
casualty
insurance
are
taxable
at
annual
--
on
their
total
annual
net
income
as
any
other
corporation.
but
life
insurance
companies
have
this
preference.
so
it
is
today
a
decided
advantage
to
qualify
as
a
life
insurance
company.
but
like
most
taxpayers,
that
is
like
most
insurance
companies,
the
taxpayers
in
these
cases
do
not
deal
exclusively
and
either
life
or
non-life
insurance
but
in
a
combination
of
those
two
types
of
insurance.
so
congress,
since
1921
has
provided
a
mathematical
test
in
the
statute
designed
to
limit
the
preferential
life
insurance
company
tax
treatment
to
those
companies
whose
predominant
business
is
the
assumption
of
life
insurance
risks.
and
it
is
done
so
by
in
section
801
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
represents
essentially
the
same
statute
that
is
existed
for
some
55
years.
essentially
the
statute
provides
that
reserves
are
the
appropriate
measuring
rod
for
determining
whether
an
insurance
company
is
a
life
insurance
company.
the
statute
provides
a
fraction.
the
numerator
of
which
is
life
insurance
reserves
and
the
--
for
purposes
of
this
case,
and
the
denominator
of
which
is
total
reserves
and
in
order
to
be
a
life
insurance
company
to
qualify
for
this
preferential
treatment,
that
fraction
has
to
be
more
than
50%.
it’s
like
your
life
insurance
reserves
have
to
be
more
than
½
of
your
total
reserves.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
now
the
question
in
this
case,
in
these
cases
that
is,
focuses
on
the
quantity
of
the
denominator
in
fraction
that
is
total
reserves.
these
cases
present
the
question
as
to
whether
certain
cancelable
accident
and
health
insurance
reserves
which
are
reserves
on
what
is
indisputably
non
life
business
are
includable
in
these
taxpayers’
total
reserves.
it’s
also
undisputed
that
if
it
is
includable,
is
that
these
accident
and
health
insurance
reserves
are
included
as
we
submit,
these
taxpayers
fail
to
qualify
its
life
insurance
companies.
and
if
they
are
excluded
as
the
court
of
claims
held
and
it’s
the
taxpayers’
submit,
then
they
do
qualify.
now,
the
case
focuses
on
the
effect
of
two
different
types
of
transactions
which
are
presented
in
combination
in
all
three
cases.
for
purposes
of
convenience,
we
have
referred
in
our
briefs
to
these
transactions
as
treaty
one
and
treaty
two.
this
is
the
nomenclature
of
the
consumer
life
insurance
company
case
which
presents
both
of
those
types
of
reinsurance
transactions.
consumer,
as
i
said,
presents
both
kinds
of
transactions.
penn
security
presents
a
treaty
one
type
arrangement
and
the
first
railroad
case
presents
only
a
treaty
two
type
arrangement.
now,
we
submit
that
the
facts
demonstrate
with
abandoned
clarity
that
the
accident
and
health
insurance
business
was
attributable
to
the
taxpayers,
so
that
the
accident
and
health
insurance
reserves
are
includable
in
the
total
reserves
of
these
taxpayers,
so
that
their
denominator
is
increased
and
the
fraction
falls
below
50%.
so
the
end
result
as
of
our
submission
is
that
the
court
of
claims
was
incorrect
in
holding
that
these
companies
qualified
as
life
insurance
companies
and
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
taxpayer
in
that
case
did
not
qualify.
i
think
it
probably
would,
instead
of
stating
the
facts
of
each
case
theory
items,
since
they
are
essentially
similar,
it
probably
would
be
helpful
to
put
the
facts
before
the
court
in
terms
of
the
treaty
i
and
treaty
ii
generic
type
transaction,
because,
as
i
said,
the
arrangements
in
all
three
cases
are
essentially
the
same.
now,
the
treaty
i
type
transaction,
the
taxpayer
insurance
companies,
that
is
consumer
life
and
penn
security,
are
subsidiaries
of
corporations
engaged
in
the
consumer
loan
business.
this
accident
and
health
insurance
that
we’re
involved
with
here
is
credit
accident
and
health
insurance,
because
when
this
people
borrow
money
from
a
consumer
loan
business,
they
generally
are
encouraged
by
life
insurance
and
accident
and
health
insurance,
and
yet
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
that
was
resolved
in
the
alinco
case
that
that
is
life
insurance
and
we’re
not
disputing
the
correctness
of
that
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
when
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly;
that’s
what
is
involved
here.
when
the
borrower
--
you
know
let’s
say,
borrows
$1,000,
he
is
encouraged
to
purchase
a
life
insurance
contract
which
will
payoff
the
outstanding
loan
balance,
so
its
decreasing
term
in
life
insurance
in
the
event
he
should
die,
or
in
the
event
that
he
should
become
disabled,
the
insurance
is
designed
to
continue
to
pay
the
loan
payments
during
the
period
of
his
disability
and
it
is
a
single
premium
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
that
is
paid
in
advance.
now
in
most
states,
finance
companies
are
prohibited
to
issue
such
credit
life
insurance.
so,
prior
to
the
treaty
i
type
arrangements
in
these
cases,
the
consumer
finance
companies
essentially
acted
as
sales
agents
for
independent
insurance
companies
and
they
receive
the
commission,
which
is
a
substantial
condition
usually
in
the
neighborhood
of
that
50%.
now,
the
treaty
i
type
arrangements
were
organized
by
the
tax
--
by
the
consumer
life
--
the
consumer
finance
companies.
they
organize
these
taxpayer
insurance
companies
as
subsidiaries
in
order
to
command
a
larger
percentage
of
the
profits
from
this
credit
insurance
business.
but
as
the
consumer,
facts
in
consumer
life
insurance
indicate,
at
first
these
newly
formed
insurance
companies,
the
subsidiaries
and
in
the
case
of
consumer
life
it
was
the
consumer
life
company,
did
not
have
sufficient
capital
to
act
as
a
direct
insurer
on
the
state
law.
under
the
state
of
the,
you
know,
of
incorporation
of
the
consumer
finance
company.
so
what
it
did
was,
they
acted
as
reinsurers
rather
than
direct
insurers.
now
under
treaty
i,
the
way
the
transaction
worked
was
as
follows:
the
independent
insurance
company
issued
the
policies
to
the
borrower
and
collected
the
premiums
in
full
just
as
it
had
previously
done
before
the
taxpayer
insurance
company
was
organized.
and
the
taxpayer,
by
contract,
by
reinsurance
contract
which
in
the
parlance
of
the
industry
is
called
the
treaty,
agreed
to
reinsure
the
risk
and
agreed
to
reimburse
the
independent
insurer
for
all
losses,
and
i’m
quoting
“actually
paid
on
both
life
polices
and
health
and
accident
policies.”
so,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
consumer
life
that
is,
the
treaty
i
type
case,
there
really
is
no
dispute
between
the
parties
although
consumer
life
has
argued
to
the
contrary
but
there
really
is
no
dispute
that
under
the
treaty
i
type
arrangement
these
taxpayer
subsidiary
insurance
companies
assume
the
entire
insurance
risk
for
these
--
before
this
coverage,
because
they,
by
contract,
agreed
to
reimburse
the
independent
insurer
for
all
claims
paid.
penn
security
doesn’t
contend
to
the
contrary
and
in
consumer
life,
well,
they
do
contend,
they
do
dispute
this
assumption
of
risk.
the
court
of
claims
found
that
they
freely
conceded
that
they
assumed
the
risk
below,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
i
don’t
think
there
really
is
any
question
that
they
did
so
concede
and
that
day
have
assumed
the
risk
by
contract.
now
in
exchange
for
the
assumption
of
this
risk
under
the
treaty
i
reinsurance
arrangement,
the
taxpayer,
consumer
life
and
penn
security,
received
substantial
percentages
of
the
commissions.
much
more
substantial
than
they
had,
you
know,
when
they
were
just
--
when
the
taxpayers
didn’t
exist
and
the
finance
companies
were
dealing
with
independent
insurance
companies.
in
consumer,
the
percentage
was
90.5%
of
premiums
and
the
penn
security
it
was
98%
of
premiums.
under
the
treaty
i
arrangement,
the
independent
company,
as
i
said,
collected
the
premiums
in
full
and
it
also
paid
all
claims
under
the
policies
as
any
direct
insurer
would.
each
month,
the
independent
company
remitted
to
the
taxpayer
insurance
companies
their
full
share
of
the
life
insurance
premiums
that
had
been
paid
by
the
borrowers.
but
with
respect
to
the
accident
and
health
insurance
premiums,
the
independent
company
remitted
to
these
taxpayers
only
that
portion
of
the
premiums
that
was
readably
allocable
to
the
prior
month’s
coverage.
so,
for
example,
assume
a
$120
accident
and
health
single
premium
that
the
tax
--
that
the
borrower
pays,
that
would
mean
essentially
that
the
independent
company
would
hold
that
$120
until
the
end
of
january
and
then
on
february
1st
or
shortly
thereafter,
would
pay
over
$10
a
month
in
february
which
is
allocable.
january’s
coverage
and
so
forth,
in
march
would
pay
over
another
$10
which
was
allocable
to
february’s
coverage.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
essentially
that’s
our
submission
mr.
chief
justice
that
for
purposes
of
treaty
i
the
independent
that
insurer
was
really
nothing
more
than
a
commission
agent,
because
when
the
smoke
clear
it
was
all
--
it
only
held
its
9.5%
of
premiums
everything
--
it
paid
the
claims
out
of
this
fund
that
was
about
to
drop
down
and
was
--
and
essentially
that
the
taxpayers
agreed
by
contract
to
assume
the
risk
and
everything
that
was
left
over,
less
its
commission,
was
paid
over
back
to
the
taxpayer
--
to
these
taxpayer
insurance
companies.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
the
reason
i
don’t
think
so
is
because
i
think
that
the
statutory
term
as
i
will
develop
at
greater
length
in
a
few
minutes.
the
statutory
term
unearned
premiums
in
section
801
(c)
(2)
does
not,
as
the
court
of
claims
held
and
these
taxpayers
submit,
although,
i
must
say
they
submitted
with
varying
the
degrees
of
differences
among
themselves,
but
we
claim
that
the
term
unearned
premiums
refers
to
unearned
premium
reserves
and
not
premium
dollars,
and
that
the
said
--
and
that
the
literal
words
of
the
statute,
we
think,
support
our
submission
here
that
the
unearned
premium
reserves
are
attributable
to
these
taxpayer
insurance
companies
which
were
on
the
risk
of
this
insurance.
i
don’t
think
that
the
positions
in
the
two
cases
are
inconsistent
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
try
to
be
consistent
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
try
to
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
surely
would
be
--
we
would
be
consistent
within
a
single
term
of
this
court.
[laughter]
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely.
[laughter
attempt]
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
unearned
premium
dollars
are
in
the
different
place.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
--
i
think
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
i’ll
be
happy
to
go
into
at
a
greater
length
during
my
argument.
i
think
that
the
words
unearned
premiums
in
the
statute
necessarily
refer
to
unearned
premium
reserves,
they
can’t
refer
to
dollars.
it
just
doesn’t
make
any
sense
for
qualification
of
life
insurance
to
turn
on
where
particular
dollars
are
located
in
an
economy
like
ours
where
everything
is
put
in
terms
of
intangible
bank
claims,
you
know,
claims
on
time
deposit.
i
mean
the
physical
location
of
the
money
i
don’t
think
makes
any
different
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
so,
i
think
the
structure,
as
i
will
point
out
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
no,
i
am
not
asking
to
change
language
of
the
statute;
i
am
asking
you
to
be
construed
and
consistent
with
what
i
think
is
the
appropriate
way.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
no
and
i
think
that
the
correct
--
right.[laughter]
i’d
like
to
turn
out
to
a
description
of
treaty
ii
before
i
go
into
our
argument.
now,
under
treaty
ii,
the
roles
of
the
taxpayer,
insurance
companies,
and
the
independent
company
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
they
were
--
they
had
the
status
of
a
direct
insurer
in
that
sense.
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
they
were
not
involved
--
but
they
were
not
--
i
think
for
state
purposes,
you
know,
they
were
a
direct
insurer.
but
i
think
that
the
substance
of
the
arrangement
was
simply,
that
they
weren’t
ensuring
anything.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
--
i
think
that’s
right.
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that’s
right.
but
essentially,
i
would
suggest
that
if
the,
you
know,
to
use
the
analogy
i
used
a
few
moments
ago,
had
the
reinsurer
or
had
an
insurance
company
taken
unearned
(a&h)
accident
and
health
premiums,
and
put
them
in
a
time
deposit
in
a
bank
and
was
not
permitted
to
withdraw
them
except
that
stated
intervals.
i
don’t
think
anybody
would
say
that
the
bank
was
--
had
the
reserves
on
the
insurance
company.
i
mean,
essentially
and
i
think
that
the
function
of
this
insurance
company,
this
direct
insurer,
under
the
treaty
i
arrangement,
was
little
more
than
that,
though
the
functions
it
performed
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
was
performing;
i
suppose
it
was
performing
a
function
under
state
law
because
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
in
consumer
life,
georgia
had
minimum
capitalization
requirements
with
consumer
life
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
right.
but
i
think,
you
know
it’s
--
i
think
it’s
common
knowledge.
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
they
shopped
around
for
the
minimum
capitalization
state
which
is
arizona
and
they
set
up
this
reinsure,
and
i
think
would
prefer
as
a
practical
matter
the
reinsure
contracted
to
pay
--
to
bare
the
risk
and
it
did
bare
the
risk.
and
there
really
wasn’t
to
any
way
that
the
direct
insurer
was
going
to
loose
anything.
he
is
going
to
perform
these
functions
which
were
proceeding
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
right,
because
the
state
law
requirements
of
georgia
would
insist
that
a
company
issuing
insurance
in
georgia
have
a
minimum
capitalization
and
that
was
the
direct
insurer.
well
we
don’t
think
that
should
make
any
difference
for
purposes
of
qualification
for
tax
purposes
like
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that’s
probably
--
i
think
that’s
right.
now,
to
describe
briefly
what
happened
under
the
treaty
ii
arrangement,
the
roles
of
the
taxpayer
and
the
independent
company
were
purportedly
reversed.
so
the
taxpayer
becomes
the
direct
insurer
and
the
independent
company,
under
this
contract,
is
characterized
as
a
reinsurer.
but
under
in
the
consumer
life
case,
80%
of
the
accident
and
health
business
was
purportedly
reinsured
with
the
independent
company
and
then
first
railroad
it
was
60%
and
then
70%.
but
what
kind
of
reinsurance
really
was
this
arrangement?
the
way
it
worked
was
the
taxpayer
paid
these
quarterly
accidents
and
health
premiums
to
the
independent
insurer,
take
keeping
back
a
tentative
commission
of
50%.
the
independent
company
then
paid
a
quarterly
rebate
or
it
called
it
an
experience
refund,
and
that
rebate
was
equal
to
the
premiums
less
to
50%
attentive
commission
which
had
already
been
received,
less
a
3%
or
4%
commission,
well,
3%
in
consumer
life,
and
then
less
all
claims
paid.
and
if
the
sum
of
these
three
things
exceeded
the
losses
under
the
insurance
--
losses
to
the
payment
of
insurance
claims,
then
those
losses
will
be
carried
forward
and
the
independent
company
would
be
able
to
charge
it
against
the
next
quarters
experience
refund.
now
important
fact
in
the
consumer
case,
the
loss
experience
was
something
like
18%
of
premiums
paid,
so
there
really
was
no
way
that
the
independent
company
was
going
to
get
more
than
its
3%
commission
or
get
less
than
its
3%
commission.
in
fact
in
the
consumer
life
case,
the
trial
judge
found
in
the
court
of
claims
that
the
likelihood,
that
the
loss
experience
would
run
so
high
that
the
3%
insurer
commission
would
be
jeopardized
with
so
remote
as
to
be
negligible
and
that
the
parties
knew
this
to
be
the
fact.
the
source
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it’s
also
a
bookkeeping
function.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
well
they
need
it
--
why
did
they
need
them
at
all.
they
needed
them
because
in
--
what
happened
was
after
consumer
life
reached
the
maximum
capitalization,
it
needed
them
because
it
could
get,
earn
more
profits
essentially.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
they
could.
i
presume
they
could
have
done
that
but
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
theory
has
to
be
essentially
that
they
did
this
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
life
insurance
company,
because
if
they
issued
this
a&h
insurance
directly,
then
the
--
there
would
be
no
question,
nobody
would
be
here
arguing
that
the
reserves
were
not
attributable
to
these
taxpayers,
and
they
would
flunk
the
50%
test.
so
they
needed
them
essentially
to
say,
“well
look,
we
put
our
a&h
reserves
somewhere
else
and
we
don’t
have
them
anymore,
so
therefore
we
are
a
life
insurance
company.”
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
didn’t.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
did
not,
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right!
in
fact,
what
happened
was
in
the
treaty
i
arrangement
they
paid
the
life
insurance
premiums
to
the
taxpayers
right
away.
there
was
no
delay
timing
of
that
payment,
because
for
their
purposes
they
wanted
to
increase
their
life
insurance
reserves
to
qualify
under
the
fraction.
now,
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
not
quarrel
with
that
proposition,
but
i
think
that
a
transaction
has
to
have
some
independent
substance,
and
here,
where
you
have
a
situation
where
these
premiums
are
just
being
held
back
and
paid
on
a
monthly
dribble.
i
mean,
that
is
really
the
only
way
to
describe
it.
i
think
that
it
is
so
to
blink
its
reality
to
say
that
this
a&
h
business
was
not
the
taxpayers’
business,
because
they
were
on
the
risk;
they
got
all
the
profits
from
it.
there
was
no
way
that
the
other
company
could
loose
and
the
other
company
was
not
really
insuring
anything.
i
mean
it
was
performing
a
function
but
it
was
performing
a
function
in
the
one
case
to
qualify
under
state,
to
qualify
these
transactions
for
state
purpose
and
the
other
case
was
simply
bold
face
attempt
to
qualify
as
a
life
insurance
company
under
the
fraction,
under
the
statutory
fractional
formula.
now,
with
respect
to
the
treaty
ii
arrangement,
the
fifth
circuit
correctly
held
in
our
view
that
there
was
no
substance
to
this
agreement
as
reinsurance
that
was
essentially
the
other
company
was
simply
earning
a
commission
and
doing
a
small
set
of
tasks,
receiving
the
premiums,
paying
out
the
claims,
and
getting
no
more
than
3%
and
getting
no
less
than
3%.
we
don’t
think
--
we
agree
that
we
don’t
think
that’s
insurance.
now,
the
proposition
that
we
urge
in
these
cases
is
a
very
simple
one.
it
is
that
for
purposes
of
the
section
801
(a)
reserve
ratio
test,
insurance
reserves
must
follow
the
insurance
risk.
since
as
i
think
is
abundantly
clear
from
the
description
of
the
facts,
the
taxpayers
bore
this
accidents
and
health
insurance
risk
under
both
the
treaty
i
and
treaty
ii
type
arrangements.
the
accident
and
the
health
insurance
reserves
are
includable
and
they
are
total
reserves,
that
is
the
denominator
of
the
statutory
fraction,
and
they
do
not
qualify
as
life
insurance
companies.
now,
we
think
the
proposition
that
reserves
must
follow
the
risk
can
be
demonstrated
in
three
different
ways:
first
we
think
the
rule
comports
with
the
fundamental
characteristics
of
insurance
and
the
essential
nature
of
what
an
insurance
reserve
is;
second,
we
think
that
the
language
of
the
reserve
ratio
test
of
section
801
(a)
and
(c)
supports
our
submission
that
reserves
to
follow
the
risk;
and
finally,
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
reserved
ratio
test
as
stating,
which
dates
back
to
1921,
supports
our
submission
that
is
insurance
reserves
must
follow
the
insurance
risk.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
i
think
it’s
fairly
undisputed
and
this
court
so
recognized
it
for
about
40
years
ago
in
the
le
gierse
case
that
the
essence
of
insurance
is
risk
shifting
and
the
essential
characteristic
of
reinsurance
is
the
transfer
of
risk
from
one
company
to
another.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
then,
i
suppose
there
would
be,
you
know,
half
of
the
reserves
would
be
allocable
to
one
and
half
to
the
other.
but
in
this
case
the
risk
was
borne
completely
mr.
chief
justice
by
the
taxpayers.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
correct,
and
to
the
extent
that
they
bare
the
risk,
the
reserves
corresponding
to
that
risk
ought
to
be
included
in
their
total
reserves.
but
when
they
don’t
bare
any
risk
at
all,
as
we
submit
these
independent
companies
did
in
these
two
different
kinds
of
arrangements,
i
don’t
think
that
they
ought
to
have
those
reserves
chargeable
to
their
total
reserves.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
under
type
two,
the
way
it
seems
to
have
worked
although
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
that
the
independent
company
paid
the
claim.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
no
that’s
the
range
in
treaty
ii,
in
the
treaty
ii
arrangement,
the
independent
company
is
the
purported
reinsurer.
although,
we
would
say
it’s
not
really
a
reinsurer
at
all.
but
the
company
that
was
called
the
reinsurer
under
the
treaty
ii
type
arrangement,
that
is
the
non-taxpayer
would
pay
the
claims.
essentially,
what
would
happen
is,
you
know,
the
taxpayer
would
issue
the
policy
and
then
it
would
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
these
taxpayers
here
whose
qualification
is
at
issue,
it
would
issue
the
insurance
policy
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
and
then
it
would
pay
out
the
premiums
on
a
quarterly
basis
but
take
back
a
tentative
50%
commission,
and
then
the
independent
company
would
pay
out
all
the
claims
out
of
the
remainder.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
could
mr.
justice
powell
but
my
only
hesitance
to
adopt
that
nomenclatures
that
we
don’t
think
that
the
treaty
ii
arrangement
was
reinsurance.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay.
yes,
the
taxpayer
and
the
other
company.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
other
company
is
called
the
reinsurer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
okay,
the
reinsurer
paid
out
the
claims.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it’s
reimbursed
out
of
--
whether
essentially
is
it’s
reimbursed
out
of
the
claim,
out
the
reimbursed
it
itself.
how
is
it
reimbursed?
it’s
reimbursed
--
it
pays
these
claims
out
the
premium
dollars
it
has,
and
then
it
pays
back
to
the
taxpayer
what’s
left
over.
and
if
there
should
ever
be
any
excess
of
losses
over
money
left
over,
which
is
in
these
cases
almost
impossible
and
the
parties
apparently
knew
this
to
be
the
fact,
so
the
trial
court
and
court
of
claims
found,
then
the
taxpayer
would
pay
it
back
out
of
the
next
quarter’s
premium
dollars.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
but
essentially
you
know
there
is
no
way
that
the
independent
company
or
“the
reinsurer”
could
lose
under
it.
it
wasn’t
going
to
get
more
than
3%,
it
wasn’t
going
to
less
than
3%.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
know.
i
really
don’t
know,
but
i
would
suggest
that
that’s
simply
a
function
--
that
could
be
arranged
between
the
parties
in
a
way
that
--
you
know
it’s
just
another
bargaining
point.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that’s
right.
i
mean
it’s
not
reinsurance.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
when
i
use
the
word
sham
one
tends
to
think
that
you
know
that
it’s
no
substance
and
that
is
sort
of
a
tax
avoidance
motive,
which
i
think
is
the
case
here,
but
i
don’t
think
it
would
matter
whether
it
was
negotiated
at
arms
length,
because
when
you
examine
the
figures
and
what,
you
know,
this
elaborate
arrangement,
which
is
called
reinsurance
but
actually
when
you
strip
away
all
the
technical,
you
know,
all
the
contract
provisions,
you
know,
i
think
for
tax
purposes
this
was
not
reinsurance.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
earn
a
3%
commission.
you
know
for
doing
relatively
a
small
amount
of
work.
i
mean,
when
we
say
sham,
i
don’t
want
to
--
i
don’t
think
that
you
have
to
go
that
far
and
knockout
the
agreement
in
some
sort
of
a
sham.
i
think
that
essentially
when
we
are
talking
about
reinsurance
at
page
--
the
examiners
handbook
which
was
introduced
in
evidence
in
the
first
railroad
case
at
page
211
of
that
appendix,
it
defines
re-insist
--
the
essential
element
of
every
true
reinsurance
contract
is
the
undertaking
by
the
reinsurer
to
indemnify
the
ceding
insurer
not
only
in
form,
but
in
fact,
against
loss
or
liability
by
reason
of
the
original
insurance.
unless
the
so
called
reinsurance
contract
contains
this
essential
element,
no
credit
whatsoever
shall
be
allowed
etcetera,
etcetera.
well
you
know,
the
insurance
industry
wouldn’t
recognize
this
as
reinsurance
and
we
don’t
think
it
is
reinsurance.
insurance
is
taking
on
a
risk.
reinsurance
is
transferring
of
a
risk,
but
there
was
no
risk
transferred
in
the
treaty
two
type
arrangements.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
state
agency
recognized
it
but
the
state
--
we
don’t
think
that
really
matters
for
purposes
of
section
801
(c)
(2)
as
i
think
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief.
the
regulations
there
say
whatever
is
regarded,
whatever
might
be
the
case
on
the
local
law,
but
the
point
to
the
matter
is
that
the
state
agents
really
you
know,
approach
this
thing
from
an
entirely
different
point
of
view.
whether
you
believe
that
they
were
smart
people
or
not
smart
people,
their
essential
purpose
was
to
make
sure
that
some
company
was
solvent
and
that
the
policy
holder
was
not
going
to
lose.
they
weren't
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
that
is
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
only
case
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
also
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right
and
i
think
that
the
case
has
to
be
examined
in
terms
of
what
is
likely.
you
know,
we
are
talking
about
--
we’re
talking
about
claims
of
18
--
claims
experience
of
18%
or
22%.
i
don’t
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
yes,
i
think
that’s
right.
now
i
want
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
what
a
reserve
is,
simply
because
i
think
that’s
critical
to
what
this
case
is
all
about.
an
insurance
reserve
is
not
as
the
court
of
claims
i
think
held
and
as
one
of
the
taxpayers
here
argues
and
the
other
taxpayers
argue
in
the
sort
of
slight
variation,
is
not
anything
that
one
keeps
in
one's
pocket.
its
not
an
asset.
it’s
simply
a
projected
liability
for,
you
know,
a
kind
of
un-accrued
liability
for
what
an
event
that
might
occur
in
the
future
in
which
an
insurance
company
basically
has
to
bear
in
mind.
so
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
for
example,
i
think
you
know
the
way
to
look
at
this
case
is
to
say
you
know,
if
an
insurance
company
assumes
a
risk
and
it
has
to
know
the
reserves
for
this
and
let’s
say
if
it
buys
stock
at
a
$100.00
and
the
stock
goes
down
to
zero
and
it
has
made
a
bad
investment.
nobody
would
say
that
its
reserves
depleted.
it
still
has
a
reserve
of
a
$100.00.
it
just
doesn’t,
you
know
we’ll
have
to
use
other
assets
to
cover
that
reserve,
but
it
still
have
a
reserve.
the
reserve
is
keep
to
the
liability,
to
the
risk
an
insurance
company
assumes
under
a
policy.
and
you
know,
there
really
is
no
matching
principle
as
such.
we
are
talking
about
the
premium
dollars
have
to
follow
the
reserve.
essentially,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
when
the
liability
is
assumed
to
the
policy
holder
that
triggers
the
creation
of
the
reserve
and
the
fact
that
these
premium
dollars
happen
to
be
in
another
pocket
so
to
speak,
for
a
delayed
reaction
of
about
a
month
or
so,
shouldn’t
make
a
difference
in
this
case
because
its
not
really
physical
location
of
an
asset
because
a
reserve
is
not
anything
physical
that
you
can
sort
of
grab
onto.
the
insurance
company
doesn’t
segregate
assets
and
say
“you
know
these
are
all
reserve
funds.”
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
reserve
fund
as
such.
the
reserve
is
the
projected
liability.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
health
and
accident
insurance,
there
is
no
accepted
table
the
way
there
is
in
life
insurance
to
sort
measure
the
risk.
so,
as
a
result
the
insurance
parlance
is
to
the
effect
that
the
unearned
premiums
equal
the
reserve
mathematically.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
the
way
it
would
be
recorded
on
the
books,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
as
i
think
we’ve
point
that
in
our
brief
in
greater
detail,
that
the
unearned
premium
dollars
are
the
reserve.
the
reserve
is
--
represents
this
projected
liability
to
the
policy
holders.
the
doc
--
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
be
put
--
it’s
not
really
a
balance
sheet
asset
like
a
liability,
but
it
would
go
in
summary
of
operations,
but
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it
would
be
a
sort
of
an
unrestricted
i
suppose,
you
know,
in
that
sense,
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think
so.
the
assets
have
always
existed.
you
know,
you're
just
assuming
one
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company
doesn’t
have
anymore
assets.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
its
essentially
has
reduced
liability.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
at
the
beginning,
i
suppose
it
would
be
--
well,
it
would
be
put
in
as
an
asset
of
premiums
received,
i
suppose
and
then
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
let's
put
it
--
oh
i
see
your
point.
well,
i
think
that
standard
--
i
think
as
we
point
out
in
brief
the
standard
general
accounting
treatment
for
this
kind
of
transaction
is
that
it
is
an
asset.
you
know,
the
tax
referred
to
it
is
funds
held
by
ceding
insurer
or
reinsurers
so
to
speak,
so
it
is
an
asset.
i
don’t
really
think
there
has
to
be
this
matching.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
i
think
our
essential
point
here
is
that
the
--
and
i
want
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
is
that
the
unearned
premiums
in
this
phrase
under
the
statute
does
not
refer
to
the
physical
dollars
or
refers
to
the
reserve
and
the
reserve
has
to
be
attributable
to
the
company
that
assumes
the
risk
because
the
reserve
represents
this
projected
liability
and
since
i
think
it’s
plain
and
it
really
can’t
be
seriously
disputed
that
these
companies
will
--
these
taxpayer
companies
were
all
on
the
risk.
i
think
that
they
have
to
be
--
it’s
their
business
and
i
think
that
their
insurance
business
necessarily
has
to
be
put
in
the
denominator
of
total
reserves.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think
you
have
to
change
in
statute
mr.
justice.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute
it
talks
about
--
there
are
three
kinds
of
reserves.
one,
life
insurance
reserves;
two,
unearned
premiums
and
unpaid
losses
not
included
in
life
insurance
reserves;
and
three,
all
other
insurance
reserves
required
by
law.
the
first
thing
you
notice
is
that
one
and
three
are
plainly
reserves.
unpaid
losses
not
included
in
life
insurance
reserves
also
strikes
one
as
a
reserve,
as
in
fact
it
is
a
reserve.
and
unearned
premiums
the
insurance
text
all
refer
to
it
is
a
reserve.
i
mean,
it
is
a
short
hand
expression
for
a
reserve.
and
i
think
that
the
calculation
of
accident
and
health
insurance,
casualty
insurance
is
put
in
terms
of
unearned
premiums
and
it
is
either
unearned
premiums
or
unearned
premiums
reserves.
i
don’t
think
that
you
know
congress
have
to
add
that
word
reserve,
i
think
they
were
writing
a
statute
for
a
very
sophisticated
industry
that
knew
what
it
wanted
and
wanted
to
measure
this
--
you
know
make
this
qualification
on
the
basis
of
reserves
and
i
don’t
these
companies
make
it
because
its
--
they
bore
this
risk
under
this
casualty
insurance.
that
is
not
life
insurance
and
they
flunk
the
50%
test.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
possibly
could
be.
you
know
for
state
counting
for
purposes.
i
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh
no.
the
federal
–
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
would
never
put
the
reserve
in
both
places.
it
would
either
be
one
and
the
other,
and
we
say
as
with
the
taxpayers.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i
think
that
we
would
--
our
rule
that
the
reserves
follow
the
risk,
we
would
obviously,
possibly
lose
some
cases
under
this
rule.
i
mean,
we
are
not
--
we
would
not
inconsistently
put
reserves
in
a
place
that
where
risk
wasn’t
just
to
disqualify
a
company.
i
think
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
maybe
a
slight
risk
as
you
pointed
out
from
insolvency
and
so
forth
and
so
on
but,
you
know
that’s
a
negligible
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
don’t
require
attribution
of
the
reserve.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
that
might
be
you
know,
that
could
be
sort
or
a
--
there
is
a
type
of
reinsurance
known
as
excess
loss
reinsurance
and
which
probably
could
be
calculated.
there
might
be
a
small
fraction
of
the
reserve
left
with
the
other
side
for
that
with
the
independent
company
for
tax
purposes.
but
i
think
that
when
we
are
talking
about
what
happened
in
the
treaty
two
case,
it
really
the
risk
was
that
reachable
and
i
think
the
reserve
belongs
with
the
company
that
realistically
bore
the
risk
here,
the
taxpayers
and
they
have
to
include
that
in
their
total
reserves.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
we
think
at
both
cases
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right
and
we
think
in
both
cases,
first
railroad
and
consumer,
the
findings
of
fact,
you
know,
even
in
the
district
court
in
first
railroad
which
held
against
the
government
acknowledged
that
it
was
almost
remote
and
negligible
that
the
other
company
had
pour
any
risks.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
i
just
have
a
few
points
to
make
mr.
chief
justice.
counsel
for
penn
security,
mr.
jones
attempted
to
characterize
that
treaty
one
arrangement
as
one
in
which
the
company,
that
is
the
taxpayer,
assumed
the
risk
as
it
received
these
premiums
on
a
monthly
basis.
but
i
think
if
the
court
examines
the
agreement
which
is
set
forth
at
page
40
a
of
the
appendix,
article
2,
simple
contradicts
that
assertion.
it
says,
“the
liability
of
taxpayer
on
all
reinsurance
shall
begin
simultaneously
with
that
of
pilot
life,
that
is
the
other
company,
and
in
no
event
shall
the
reinsurance
of
taxpayer
be
in
force
and
binding
unless
the
policy
issued
by
pilot
life
is
enforced.”
i
think
it's
plain
that
the
very
--
that
the
port
of
this
agreement
was
that
at
the
very
beginning
once
the
policy
holder
has
paid
the
premium,
penn
security
and
consumer
life
in
the
treaty
one
arrangement
were
on
the
risk
and
if
they
were
on
the
risk.
they
have
to
project
that
liability
and
they
have
to
--
that
those
insurance
reserves
are
includable
in
its
total
reserves.
i
would
think
that
the
tax
law
and
the
insurance
law
is
not
that
primitive
that
it
cannot
recognize
that
these
contractual
assumptions
of
risk
in
exchange
for
a
receipt
of
premiums
which
are
going
to
drop
down
to
these
taxpayers
should
not
be
attributed
to
it
as
accident
and
health
insurance
business
are
to
be
includable
in
the
total
reserves,
the
denominator
of
the
statutory
fraction.
i
have
one
last
point
to
make
and
that
is
with
the
respect
to
business
purpose.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
this
morning
from
counsel
for
the
taxpayers
that
that
they
were
business
purposes
to
these
agreements,
and
that
they
were
very
sophisticated.
that
may
well
be
the
case,
but
there
was
no
insurance
purpose
to
these
treaty
two
arrangements.
the
risk
in
the
treaty
two
arrangement
stayed
with
the
taxpayers
and
the
treaty
one
arrangement
it
was
real
reinsurance
that
was
assumed
by
the
taxpayers.
that
to
us
means
that
it
was
insurance
business,
accident
health
insurance
which
has
to
be
attributed
to
the
taxpayers.
thank
you.
