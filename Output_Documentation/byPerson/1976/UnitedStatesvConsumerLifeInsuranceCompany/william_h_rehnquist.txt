mr.
smith,
i
think
you
argued
foster
lumber
here
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
a
few
weeks
ago,
don’t
you,
and
you
prevailed
by
a
narrowly
divided
vote
over
a
strong
dissent,
and
it
struck
there
that
the
government’s
position
was
that
we
read
the
statute
as
written
and
don’t
make
any
allowance
for
equities
or
substance
or
that
sort
of
thing.
now
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
government
is
kind
of
talking
out
of
the
other
side
of
its
mouth
that’s
saying
in
effect,
“well,
we
can’t
read
it
quite
the
way
it’s
written
we’ve
got
to
make
sure
that
substance
rather
than
form
prevails.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
legitimate
purpose
at
any
business
is
the
avoidance
of
taxes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
asking
us
to
make
two
changes
in
the
statute
that
one
we
had
the
word
reserve
to
the
word
premium
and
then
we
attribute
the
reserve
to
the
insurer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
additions
to
the
language
that
