justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
say
that
the
reinsuring
company
would
pay
the
claim?
i
think
you
did,
under
type
two.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
by
independent
do
you
mean
the
company
that
issued
the
policy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
taxpayer
is
the
company
that
qualifies
as
a
life
--
as
an
insurance
company?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
put
me
off
a
bit
when
you
say
independent.
couldn’t
we
speak
in
terms
of
the
insurer
and
the
reinsurer?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
are
not
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
other
company,
the
reinsurer?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
we
are
not
going
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
of
your
nomenclature.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
the
reinsurer
pays
or
declaim
inheres
that
reimbursed
by
the
insurance
company.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
in
that
situation,
the
reimbursement
would
be
delayed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
event
of
that
delay
would
interest
be
paid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
you
regard
the
whole
thing
as
a
sham
as
your
brief
states.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
but
is
it
also
a
sham
were
there
is
no
parent
subsidiary
relationship
and
this
is
a
contract
of
reinsurance
negotiated
at
arms
length?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it
is
a
sham,
what
would
be
the
business
reason
for
an
independent
reinsurer
to
enter
into
a
sham
arrangement
as
to
be
nice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
state
agency
do
recognize
the
agreement?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
case
of
health
and
accident
insurance,
do
you
also
have
a
reserve
for
the
unearned
premium
as
distinguished
from
the
reserve
representing
the
risk
on
premium?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
they
way
it’s
recorded
on
the
books?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
take
your
$120.00
example,
you
started
putting
a
$120.00
if
you
had
the
entire
right
to
the
premium
on
the
reserve
side
of
your
balance
sheet
as
a
liability.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
a
reserve
is
on
the
liability
side
of
a
balance
sheet.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
that
reserve
would
be
reduced
by
1/12?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
that
would
be
taken
into
income
at
that
point,
the
1/12
of
the
premium?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
it
would
be
income?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
on
which
the
taxpayer
would
pay
a
tax.
do
you
put
anything
on
the
balance
--
on
the
asset
side
of
the
balance
sheet
to
reflect
the
fact
that
you
have
earned
1/12
of
the
premium?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
put
a
claim
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
do
you
put
on
the
asset
side
of
the
balance
sheet
at
the
beginning,
a
$120.00?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
before
it
is
collected?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
carry
on
mr.
smith.
i
was
just
trying
to
visualize
balance
sheet
transactions
implicated
by
what
you
are
talking
about,
but
i
don’t
know
that
the
is
necessarily
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
smith,
i
do
want
to
ask
one
other
question
because
under
your
theory
the
unearned
premium
reserve
on
the
accident
and
health
business
remains
with
the
taxpayer
because
it
only
takes
the
risk
as
you
analyze
it.
whereas
the
unearned
premium
dollars
would
be
with
the
reinsurer
in
the
treaty
two
situation.
would
you
say
that
there
is
an
unearned
premium
reserve
matching
the
unearned
premium
dollars
in
the
reinsurer
as
well
as
in
the
taxpayer
or
just
a
reserve
in
two
places
at
once?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
first
of
this
involves
three
life
insurance
companies
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
federal
income
tax
burden
on
life
insurance
companies
is
considerably
lower
than
that
imposed
on
other
insurance
companies.
a
question
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
taxpayers,
three
insurance
companies,
that
write
both
life
and
non-life
insurance
qualify
for
this
preferential
treatment.
for
a
reason
set
forth
in
their
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
with
the
taxpayers
that
they
do
qualify.
the
judgments
in
75-1221
and
75-1285,
the
cases
hereon
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims
are
affirmed.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
75-1260
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
