mr.
james
r.
harper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
is
correct
in
appointing
out
that
the
government
provided
a
mathematical
test,
a
ratio,
but
i
believe
it
is
subject
to
criticism.
we
are
not
pointing
out
to
you
that
the
congress
has
also
passed
a
statutory
framework
for
the
analysis
of
these
problems.
not
only
has
the
congress
enacted
law,
but
the
treasury
itself
has
explained
many
of
the
terms.
without
proceeding
to
the
more
orderly
part
of
my
discussion,
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
it’s
quite
painful
to
me
that
the
government
would
come
in
and
tell
you
that
the
statute
said
unearned
premiums
and
meant
reserve.
because
i
point
out
to
you
in
section
801
(3)
(e)
the
treasury
itself
defined
unearned
premiums.
unearned
premiums
are
those
amounts
which
shall
cover
the
cost
of
carrying
the
insurance
risk.
i
feel
it
is
in
fact
a
liability.
i
don’t
see
how
it’s
going
to
cover
the
insurance
risk.
i
think
they
have
aborted
their
own
regulations
and
tried
to
ignore
them.
i
point
out
may
other
differences,
but
before
i
do
i’d
like
to
discuss
for
a
moment
“risks.”
it
was
appointed
out
by
mr.
justice
stevens
that
there
are
two
risks.
i’d
like
to
point
a
third.
there
is
a
distinct
third
risk
and
that
is
in
having
too
small,
an
insurance
base
to
adequately
determine
premiums.
for
example
in
our
case
here,
there
was
evidence
that
a
number
of
the
agents
had
loss
experiences
that
were
above
the
96%.
i
point
out
to
you
that
one
of
the
risks
is
that
you
do
not
have
a
broad
enough
base
to
have
a
determinable
premium.
and
let’s
talk
for
a
moment
about
premiums
and
may
i
distinguish
because
it
must
be
done,
may
i
distinguish
the
risks
of
a
life
insurance
and
the
risks
of
an
accident
and
health.
it
has
over
the
many
years
been
clear
that
the
life
of
a
group
of
people
was
predictable,
the
mortality
tables
would
so
advice
you,
not
as
to
one
individual
man
but
the
death
is
a
predictable
thing.
the
amount
of
a
reserve
for
life
insurance
becomes
an
obligation
because
each
day
that
inevitable
death
approaches.
the
risk
then
is
greater
as
time
passes
and
man
gets
older.
it
is
entirely
the
opposite
for
accident
and
health.
every
month
you
get
by,
i
think
we
are
all
happy
while
we
made
another
month
and
we
are
not
sick,
i’m
glad
i’m
not
like
old
george.
every
month
that’s
true
of
the
accident
and
health
insurance
business.
this
is
a
risk
not
predictable
upon
the
basis
of
actuarial
certainty.
a
risk
which
is
so
indeterminate
that
the
law
requires
that
the
entire
unearned
premium
be
set
aside
at
the
moment
of
sale,
when
you
sell
life
insurance
you
can
look
at
the
premium
you
got,
look
at
the
mortality
table,
and
you
have
earned
some
income
at
that
moment.
in
the
case
of
accident
and
health
it's
not
so.
mr.
james
r.
harper
no,
i
think
not
only
insofar
as
the
reasons
which
would
justify
the
undertaking.
for
example
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
it
is
all
term
insurance.
mr.
james
r.
harper
it
does
--
it
does
not
vary
with
the
age,
however
the
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
well,
it
plays
in
here
very
definitely
because
you
cannot
take
any
portion
of
this
accident
and
health
risk
insurance
into
income.
it
is
reserved
and
set
aside.
you
earn
money
when
you
sell
life
insurance.
there
is
no
money
earned
when
accident
and
health
insurance
is
sold.
mr.
james
r.
harper
it
is
earned
in
a
pro
rata
amount.
mr.
james
r.
harper
now,
i’d
like
to
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
oh,
i
think
they
are
just
--
i
think
this
are
different
names
for
the
same
as
i’ve
understood
it
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
this
is
just
the
reciprocal
one
or
the
other,
but
that
does
not
predict
the
risk
of
going
to
the
hospital
for
example
or
being
disabled,
but
i
must
point
out
another
reason.
actually
held,
i
think
was
actually
covered
briefly
ceding
statement,
but
let
me
point
out,
that
the
problem
of
state
authorities
is
to
be
sure
that
there
are
funds
there
to
pay
the
insured
when
he
is
entitled
indemnification.
we
then
find
that
there
is
a
clear
requirement
first
that
the
amount
be
actually
held.
that
means
that
there
must
be
a
funded
reserve.
there
are
two
types
of
reserves.
there
are
those
reserves
that
a
bondholder
might
insist
upon
merely
earmarking
a
portion
of
surplus.
but
if
that
bondholder
wants
to
be
certain
that
bonds
are
going
to
be
paid
at
the
appointed
time,
he
requires
that
funds
be
allocated
and
we
know
the
term
sinking
fund
and
i
say
that
that’s
what
they
wanted
here.
when
the
state
authorities
set
out
the
requirement
of
actually
held,
they
did
mean
that
it
was
a
funded
reserve
and
we
submit
that
premiums
were
the
funds.
now,
in
the
regulations
which
they
have
ignored
completely
there
is
the
very
interesting
requirement
of
section
1
805
(b).
reserves
required
by
the
law
means
those
reserves
which
are
reported
on
the
annual
statement.
this
annual
statement
goes
to
the
state
authority.
they
don’t
just
want
a
funded
reserve.
they
want
it
reported
to
the
state
as
to
what
the
reserve
is.
now,
there
are
some
differences
here
between
the
parties,
but
i'd
like
to
point
it
out
that
at
the
time
these
people
in
georgia
undertook
to
go
into
accident
and
health
insurance,
they
went
into
it
because
of
a
claimer
of
their
agents
to
have
a
single
policy,
a
single
insurance
company
that
would
cover
it.
they
also
undertook
it
with
what
we
described
as
minimum
capital,
but
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
minimum
capital
under
our
statute
was
$400,000.00.
by
the
time
they
undertook
the
accident
and
health
insurance
business,
the
insurance
reserves
or
what
we
know
as
the
surplus
funds
were
well
over
$400,000.00
and
by
this
agreement
we
brought
into
play
and
into
risk
reserves
that
we
are
well
over
$400,000.00
in
the
re-insuring
company.
it
was
real,
it
was
real
in
that
it
starts
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
we
had
some
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
our
company
originally
acted
as
a
reinsurance
business
for
life
insurance
at
one
point.
mr.
james
r.
harper
and
there
were
some
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
i
think
that’s
correct.
i
would
not
be
certain.
mr.
james
r.
harper
there
is
a
business
reason
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
--
in
that
we
need
a
broader
base.
although,
we
had
over
$400,000.00
in
reserves.
the
authorities
that
testified
and
the
college
professor
who
testified
recognized
that
the
ability
to
take
on
new
business
was
limited
to
those
who
had
policies,
prem
--
policy
premiums
that
no
more
than
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
it
did
broaden
the
base,
but
of
course
it
also
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
well
of
course,
the
life
business
is
a
little
more
profitable
among
other
things.
life,
credit
life
is
a
much
better
deal
than
accident
and
health.
and
i
think
that
probably
that
was
undertaken
for
business
reasons
to
make
more
money.
i
think,
it
is
also
undertaken
probably
because
of
tax
reasons.
i’d
like
to
point
out
though
that
we
took
in
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
well,
this
made
it
possible
to
broaden
or
to
sell
more
insurance
across
the
board,
very
definitely
and
it
was
very
critical
to
broaden
the
base
because
you
have
to
set
premiums
and
it
has
to
be
a
reliable
standard.
we
want
to
make
some
money,
but
the
big
thing
about
reinsurance
and
they
failed
to
note
this,
the
big
thing
about
reinsurance
is
that
it
tends
to
stabilized
results.
the
actuary
who
testified
in
our
case
testifies
that
the
basic
purpose
is
really
spread
the
fluctuation
of
a
companies
earnings
to
sort
of
level
out
their
claims
experience.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
a
transaction
that
would
have
been
undertaken
with
third
parties,
just
as
quickly
as
it
would
have
been
undertaken
by
people
with
enough
money
in
georgia
to
bear
the
reinsurance
risk.
now,
there
are
sound
reasons
for
it.
the
government
complains
that
there
was
a
carry
over
provision.
but
this
too
spreads
fluctuation
from
year
to
year.
it
tends
to
insulate
you
from
shock
losses,
from
catastrophic
amounts
which
could
wipe
you
out.
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
to
some
extent
this
risk,
test
must
depend
upon
hindsight.
it
is
easy
for
mr.
smith
to
say
there
is
not
much
risk
of
insolvency,
but
insurance
companies
do
go
insolvent.
this
very
company
here
after
it
went
into
accident
and
health
and
exhibit
23
will
show
it,
there
were
years
in
which
they
lost
money.
and
when
they
increased
their
sales
by
three-fold,
they
then
begin
to
realize
a
profit
on
accident
and
health.
they
had
to
go
into
accident
and
health
in
order
to
meet
the
claimer
of
their
agents.
i
think
i
must
develop
some
--
to
some
extent
the
business
purpose.
i’d
like
to
go
back
to
the
rules
of
this
court
and
particularly
to
the
helvering
against
gregory
in
which
we
quoted
all
the
time.
everybody
says
you
don’t
have
to
arrange
your
affairs
to
pay
the
most
tax.
mr.
justice
hand
went
on
to
say
that
the
underlying
presumption
is
plain.
that
the
act
was
undertaken
for
reasons
to
germane
to
the
business.
and
we
do
not
proceed
upon
any
business
purpose
here
that
was
not
to
germane
to
and
that
it
did
not
forward
the
insurance
business.
that
reinsurer
was
required
and
judge
ronnie
(ph)
said
the
reinsurer
is
required
to
commit
its
assets
to
reserve
status
for
reinsurance
purposes
and
to
pay
tax
on
the
reserve
for
tax
purposes.
they
bore
all
the
legal
consequences
of
the
required
reserves.
they
reported
the
reserves
as
required
by
law
and
there
was
no
exception
taken
to
it.
the
reinsurer
bore
none
of
these
risks.
the
statement
requirement
has
an
economic
impact
--
mr.
james
r.
harper
i’m
not
through,
but
i
quit.[laughter]
mr.
james
r.
harper
i’m
sure
he
does.[laughter]
