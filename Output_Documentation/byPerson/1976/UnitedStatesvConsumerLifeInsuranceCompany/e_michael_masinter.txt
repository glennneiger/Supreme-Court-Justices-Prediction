mr.
e.
michael
masinter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
counsel
for
respondent
consumer
life
insurance
company.
in
this
case,
the
government
seeks
to
reverse
the
holding
of
the
court
of
claims
and
asks
this
court
to
hold
that
certain
unearned
premium
reserves
relating
to
accident
and
health
insurance
should
be
attributed
or
imputed
may
actually
be
a
better
word,
to
respondent.
reserves
which
respondent
did
not
hold,
but
were
held
by
unrelated
insurance
company,
reserves
which
respondent
was
not
required
to
maintain
pursuant
to
state
law
or
state
regulatory
purposes,
reserves
which
respondent
was
not
required
to
maintain
pursuant
to
standard
accounting
and
actuarial
principles
applicable
to
this
industry.
now,
this
case
involves
both
the
treaty
one
and
the
treaty
two
situation.
in
the
treaty
one
situation,
american
bankers
life
insurance
company
was
the
unrelated
company
and
it
wrote
the
insurance
and
respondent
was
the
reinsurer.
in
the
treaty
two
situation,
respondent
was
the
insurer
and
the
unrelated
company
was
the
reinsurer.
the
facts
are
un-controverted
that
the
reserves
where
actually
held
by
american
bankers,
the
unrelated
company
and
that
american
bankers
earned
the
investment
income
on
these
reserves,
and
included
these
reserves
in
their
reports
for
state
reporting
purposes.
both
respondent
and
american
bankers
were
subject
to
regular
tri-annual
examinations
by
the
state
authorities
of
arizona,
georgia,
and
florida,
and
other
states.
and
during
the
years
at
issue,
none
of
these
state
insurance
commissions
required
either
respondent
or
american
bankers
to
change
their
method
of
reporting
of
these
reserves.
as
all
the
counsels
seem
to
agree,
the
central
issue
here
is
the
definition
of
reserves
as
set
forth
in
section
801
of
the
code
as
to
which
we
believe
there
are
two
overriding
principles.
firstly,
that
the
test
for
qualification
as
a
life
insurance
company
is
clearly
set
forth
in
the
code
as
the
reserve
ratio
test,
that
is
to
qualify
as
a
life
insurance
company.
a
company’s
life
insurance
reserves
must
comprise
more
than
50%
of
its
total
reserves.
and
secondly,
the
congressional
intent
is
clear
that
state
law
shall
control
in
matters
relating
to
the
substantive
definitions
of
insurance
companies.
nevertheless,
in
the
face
of
these
clear
principles,
the
government
seeks
attribution
of
these
reserves
on
a
very
novel
theory.
this
theory
is
that
reserves
follow
the
risk,
a
theory
which
we
would
submit
goes
beyond
the
clear
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
intent
of
congress
because
this
theory
maintains
that
the
legal
definition
of
reserves
is
who
bears
the
ultimate
insurance
risk.
the
term
reserves,
total
reserves,
and
reserves
required
by
law
are
all
used
in
the
statute.
but
the
statute
does
not
define
them
technically.
however,
the
cases
in
this
court
have
consistently
held
and
this
goes
back
to
the
maryland
casualty
case
that
these
terms
are
deemed
to
have
a
technical
meaning.
that
is
to
say,
a
meaning
consistent
with
that
used
by
the
state
law,
by
the
state
regulatory
authorities
and
a
meaning
consistent
with
the
common
and
prudent
business
practice
in
the
insurance
industry.
nonetheless,
the
government
argues
that
state
law
is
irrelevant
and
the
government
also
says
today
that
the
state
insurance
regulatory
authorities
don’t
care
about
these
reserves
as
they
are
before
the
court
in
the
cases
today.
we
would
suggest
that
the
state
regulatory
authorities
who
have
the
primary
responsibility
for
looking
for
the
safety
of
the
policy
holders,
and
therefore,
looking
for
the
solvents
for
the
safety
and
importance
of
the
solvency
of
these
companies
would
not
respond
very
favorably
to
the
government's
comments.
now
the
reserve
ratio
test
in
section
801
has
been
in
the
code
for
a
long
time.
it
was
originally
enacted
in
1921.
the
present
statutory
definition
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
revenue
act
of
1942
and
during
this
long
history,
never
has
there
been
one
suggestion
in
any
case
or
in
the
legislative
history
before
congress
that
the
test
should
be
reserves
follow
the
risk.
another
thing
that
is
important
is
that
the
cases
have
always
used
the
term
funds
held.
and
in
fact
the
treasury’s
own
regulations
require
that
funds
must
be
held.
in
the
present
case,
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
both
treaty
one
and
treaty
two
situation,
the
accident
and
health
reserves
covered
by
these
reinsurance
treaties
were
not
held
by
respondent
and
pursuant
to
the
terms
and
treaties
themselves
and
pursuant
to
the
requirements
of
state
law.
these
unearned
premiums
did
not
constitute
the
assets
of
respondent
on
its
balance
sheet,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
requirement
that
it
maintained
the
corresponding
reserve.
the
court
below
placed
very
heavy
in
emphasis
on
the
requirements
of
the
statutory
provisions
of
the
states
of
georgia
and
arizona.
in
recognition,
we
would
submit
of
the
clear
congressional
intent
that
state
law
must
apply
in
matters
relating
to
substantive
definitions
of
insurance
companies.
the
government’s
argument
in
this
case
today
ignores
the
requirements
of
the
state
law
as
interpreted
by
the
regulatory
authorities
of
both
georgia
and
arizona.
court
of
claims
stressed
the
generally
accepted
principles
that
where
a
statute
is
ambiguous
or
doubtful
and
in
the
absence
of
judicial
authority
to
the
contrary,
the
uniform
and
consistent
interpretation
of
that
statute
by
the
regulatory
body
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
administering
the
statute
is
entitled
to
great
weight.
this
principle
is
clearly
applicable
in
the
present
case
and
this
court
should
give
right
weight
to
the
fact
that
the
state
regulatory
authorities
of
both
arizona
and
georgia
made
no
change
in
the
reporting
of
the
reserves
of
respondent.
this
was
the
case
even
after
there
were
two
tri-annual
examinations
during
the
taxable
years
at
issue
and
this
was
the
case
when
special
attention
was
given
to
these
reinsurance
treaties
and
the
reserves
by
the
examiner
from
the
state
of
arizona.
and
even
after
these
two
examinations
and
their
special
attention
was
given,
no
change
was
made
in
the
reporting
of
the
reserves
by
respondent.
therefore,
we
would
submit
that
a
departure
from
such
a
time
honored
principle
as
we
have
referred
to
is
not
warranted
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
as
each
of
these
consolidated
cases
clearly
indicate,
we
are
swallowed
up
in
a
sea
of
complex
terms
and
equally
complex
contractual
arrangements
which
are
perplexing
to
lawyers
and
layman
alike.
the
depth
of
this
complexity
it
seems
to
me
demonstrates
even
more
clearly
that
congressional
wisdom
of
leaving
substantive
definitions
to
the
state
regulatory
authorities
who
have
a
vested
interest
in
regulating
the
industry
and
who
have
a
necessary
training
and
expertise
to
comprehend
these
complex
reinsurance
arrangements.
indeed
--
mr.
e.
michael
masinter
your
honor,
i
believe
under
the
terms
of
the
contract,
the
claim
would
have
--
actually
be
paid
by
the
direct
insurer
because
a
contract
provides
that
to
reinsurer
shall
reimburse
the
direct
insurer,
but
other
than
the
contract
i
don’t
think
there
is
any
specific
evidence
on
that
point.
i
would
have
to
go
further
and
explain
that
it
is
common
and
customary
in
this
industry
for
a
company
like
american
bankers
for
example
to
assist
in
maintaining
the
books
and
the
records
because
it
is
clear
that
they
do
have
staff
and
the
machinery
and
the
computers
and
that
type
of
thing
whereas
the
companies
like
consumer
did
not
have
the
inadequate
personnel
to
perform
the
record
keeping.
we
would
submit,
your
honor
that
these
complex
reinsurance
arrangements
are
the
results
of
highly
creative
people,
actuaries
and
businessman
alike.
and
that
ones
their
efforts
have
come
together
to
produce
a
complex
and
sophisticated
reinsurance
arrangements
such
as
we
have
in
these
cases
today
that
the
federal
income
tax
consequences
should
flow
from
the
regulatory
interpretation
of
these
arrangements
and
not
otherwise.
we
think
it
is
very
important
that
federal
income
tax
consequences
look
to
the
substantive
law
of
the
states.
this
is
clearly
the
most
efficient
and
effective
method
of
imposing
our
federal
income
tax
system
on
this
industry
and
would
permit
a
greater
certainty
in
the
planning
of
the
tax
and
financial
affairs
of
these
companies.
the
government
has
argued
on
brief
that
the
issues
and
the
cases
dealing
with
the
issue
of
substance
versus
form
should
be
applicable
in
this
case.
the
government
cannot
be
heard
to
say
that
these
issues
are
applicable
here.
these
treaties
cannot
be
disregarded
for
lack
of
economic
substance
or
business
purpose.
the
court
below
clearly
found
that
these
reinsurance
treaties
had
a
business
purpose,
but
moreover
and
more
importantly,
these
theory
should
have
no
application
to
the
reinsurance
transaction
in
this
case.
out
of
the
multitude
of
cases
that
had
dealt
with
the
question
of
substance
versus
form
before
this
court
and
other
lower
federal
courts.
one
very
clear
common
threat
or
common
principle
has
developed.
a
principle
conceived
by
judge
learned
hand
in
his
dissent
in
the
case
of
gilbert
versus
commissioner
and
which
was
followed
by
this
court
in
the
knetsch
case.
judge
hand’s
test
was,
if
the
taxpayer
enters
into
a
transaction
that
does
not
appreciably
affect
his
beneficial
interest
except
to
reduce
his
tax,
the
law
will
disregard
it.
stated
conversely,
this
test
would
recognize
business
transactions
for
tax
purposes
if
they
were
treated
consistently
for
material
non-tax
purposes.
furthermore,
we
would
submit
that
this
test
would
have
the
effect
of
recognizing
for
tax
purposes
transactions
between
unrelated
parties
dealing
in
arms
length
except
transactions
which
have
no
economic
purpose
apart
from
tax
savings,
as
clearly
was
the
situation
in
the
knetsch
case.
since
the
transactions
in
the
present
case
possessed
material
business
motives
apart
from
tax
deferment
motives,
the
appreciable
effect
test
as
applied
to
the
facts
in
this
case
would
compel
a
result
that
these
reinsurance
transactions
should
not
be
disregarded
for
lack
of
economic
substance
or
business
purpose.
in
this
case,
we
see
a
factual
situation
where
the
respondent
and
an
unrelated
insurance
company
carefully
arranged
their
business
relationship
in
a
sophisticated,
business
like
manner,
totally
in
compliance
with
state
law
and
state
regulatory
law
and
totally
in
compliance
with
the
income
tax
statute
when
it
was
permitted
to
qualify
as
a
life
insurance
company.
the
challenge
it
would
seem
to
me,
if
any
is
to
be
made
to
this
reinsurance
arrangement
which
is
so
common
in
the
credit
insurance
industry,
properly
lies
in
the
converse
where
statutory
provisions
maybe
studied
with
care
and
precision
and
where
statutes
maybe
written
to
apply
in
a
consistent
fashion
to
the
entire
industry,
a
result
that
we
would
submit
is
paramount
in
this
complex
area
of
a
law.
sophisticated
business
arrangements
that
had
been
in
effect
for
many
years
in
a
particular
industry
as
is
the
case
here,
should
not
be
overturned
on
the
basis
of
legal
theories
which
find
no
support
in
the
case
law
the
legislative
history
or
in
fact
among
the
regulatory
bodies
who
have
the
responsibility
for
regulating
the
industry
and
to
whom
the
federal
taxing
law
looks
for
substantive
guidance.
we
would
strongly
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims.
thank
you.
