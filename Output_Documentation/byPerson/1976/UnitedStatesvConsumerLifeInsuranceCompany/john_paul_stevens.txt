justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith
just
to
follow
up
on
what
justice
rehnquist
said.
you’d
read
the
words
unearned
premium
and
the
statute
is
saying
unearned
premium
reserve.
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
is
the
--
and
you
acknowledge
the
unearned
premiums
are
in
a
different
place
than
the
unearned
premium
reserve.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
say
unearned
premiums
doesn’t
mean
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
congress
omitted
a
word,
it’s
perfectly
clear
and
intended
to
include
where
concern
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
are,
to
a
certain
extent,
asking
as
to
change
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sort
of
an
equitable
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
let
me
just
cover
one
another
thing
with
you
before
you
get
into
treaty
ii.
in
response
to
the
chief
justice
you
said
that
the
insurance
company,
the
independent
insurance
company
was
in
the
nature
of
a
general
agent
performing
a
bookkeeping
function
but
it
isn’t
it
correct
that
it
hadn’t
--
had
they
been
merely
a
bookkeeper,
the
reinsure
couldn’t
have
qualified
for
this
insurance
coverage.
weren’t
they
wasn’t
that
essential
that
have
the
stat
of
the
capital
in
order
to
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they
not
have
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they
not,
by
qualifying
as
an
insurance
company,
provide
something
that
the
transaction
which
a
general
agent
or
a
bookkeeper
or
a
client
could
not
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that
were
not
true
they
wouldn’t
have
been
in
the
picture
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith
is
that
quite
fair
because,
didn’t
state
law
have
--
isn’t
the
purpose
of
the
state
law
to
be
sure
that
a
company
of
a
certain
capital
structure
is
able
to
assume
the
risks
that
all
the
policy
of
holders
rely
on
when
they
take
out
there
insurance.
and
isn’t
it
performing
a
function
in
the
whole
risk
taking
picture
that
is
essential
for
a
large
company
to
perform?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
purpose
of
a
minimum
capitalization
--
the
purpose
of
those
requirements
is
to
be
sure
there
is
a
company
there
with
efficient
substance
to
assume
these
risks.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
the
risk
in
a
way
which
would
not
have
satisfied
state
law
requirements
without
this
other
company
in
the
picture.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
only
purpose
of
my
questioning
was
to
test
the
importance
of
your
point
that
they
are
nothing
more
than
a
bookkeeper.
they
also
performed
an
essential
function
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
independent
company
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
let
me
just
interject
you,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
you
cover
it.
what
is
your
conception
of
the
independent
company
in
treaty
i
situation,
is
kind
of
a
bookkeeping
function?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
treaty
ii
what
is
your
conception
of
the
contribution
to
the
total
arrangement
which
the
independent
company
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
did
they
need
them
at
all,
if
you
are
correct.
that
there
really
is
a
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
if
there
were
no
reinsurance
arrangement
at
all?
why
wouldn’t
they
just
completely
cancel
the
reinsurance
arrangement
if
there
really
is
no
risk
that
they
after
reinsure
against?
why
would
they
make
more
money
by
just
taking
them
out
of
the
picture
completely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
must
have
a
theory
as
to
why
they
didn’t.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that
would
explain
why
they
would
reinsure
the
a&h,
but
why
would
they
reinsure
the
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
not
reinsure
the
life
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
qualify.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
that
very
point
mr.
smith.
supposing
in
the
treaty
two
situation,
the
taxpayer
became
insolvent
that
i
suppose
is
theoretically
possible
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--
you
say
as
the
practical
matter
its
unlikely
to
happen.
in
that
event
the
risk
would
fall
squarely
on
the
reinsurer,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn’t
there
a
second
case.
supposing
you
had
a
very
serious
epidemic
and
unpredictable
number
of
claims
accrued
that
were
far
above
what
anybody
anticipated.
is
it
not
possible
that
the
reinsurer
would
assume
that
risk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
are
two
risks
that
the
reinsurer
assumes
that
are
both
rarely
unlikely,
but
yet
our
risk
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
look
at
likelihoods
and
probabilities
rather
than
the
literal
language
of
the
contracts
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it’s
a
--
a
reserve
is
a
liability.
does
the
balance
sheet
require
that
there
be
an
off
setting
asset
for
that
liability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
this
to
be
a
liability
to
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
sit
down,
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
for
federal
tax
purposes
assuming
that
the
reinsurer
was
also
a
company
that
was
in
the
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
will
never
be
included
in
the
reinsurer's
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
was
of
difference
between
qualifying
as
a
life
company
and
for
the
reinsurer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
fact
that
you
say
the
risk
is
in
the
taxpayer
does
not
necessarily
negate
the
possibility
that
it’s
also
in
the
reinsurer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn’t
think
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
risk
were
just
a
little
more
probable
in
the
other
company.
there
is
a
legal
risk
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
they
also
have
the
premium
dollars.
would
that
ever
require
them
that
be
considered
also
having
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
issue
really
turns
on
a
kind
of
a
finding
of
fact
as
to
which
company
realistically
takes
the
greater
share
of
the
risk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
rather
than
the
terms
of
the
contract.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
harper
let
me
just
interrupt
because
there
is
something
running
through
my
mind
that
i’m
not
sure
i
understand.
you
have
a
treaty
two
situation,
is
that
correct?
and
you
re-insure,
your
client
is
a
direct
insurer
and
you
re-insure
the
a
&
h
business
but
not
the
life
business,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
with
the
respect
to
the
years
that
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
the
years
in
issue,
is
it
correct
that
you
re-insured
the
accident
and
health
business
and
not
the
life
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
business
reason
for
that
other
than
the
favorable
tax
consequences?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if,
so
what
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what
was
that
broadened
your
base,
the
reinsurance
of
the
a
&
h
business,
did
that
broaden
your
base?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn’t
it
broaden
it
even
more
to
re-insure
the
life
business
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words
on
the
a
&
h
business,
your
primary
motivation
was
to
broaden
the
base
at
the
sacrifice
of
some
profit?
in
the
life
business
you
are
more
interested
in
making
profit,
not
interested
in
broadening
your
base?
justice
john
paul
stevens
counsel
could
i
just
interrupt
on
one
question,
factual
question.
does
the
record
tell
us
in
the
treaty
two
situation,
who
does
the
administration,
who
at
the
basic
claim,
the
reinsurer
or
the
direct
insurer?
