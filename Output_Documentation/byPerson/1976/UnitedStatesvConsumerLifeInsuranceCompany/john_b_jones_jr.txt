mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
counsel
for
penn
security
in
number
1285
and
to
just
remind
the
court
our
case
presents
solely
a
treaty
one
situation
because
i
think
much
of
what
mr.
smith
has
just
said
has
no
barring
on
a
treaty
one
situation.
i’ll
be
followed
by
mr.
harper
for
the
first
railroad
and
he
will
be
representing
a
taxpayer
as
a
treaty
two
situation
and
mr.
masinter
will
conclude
and
his
case
includes
both
the
treaty
one
and
the
treaty
two
issues.
i’m
sure
the
court
is
aware
from
its
questions
that
what
the
statutory
test
says
and
that
penn
security
meets
the
statutory
test
in
terms
of
the
reserves
which
it
has
on
its
books
and
which
it
reports
to
state
authorities
and
which
they
have
approved.
and
i
think
it
is
also,
i
preferred
nothing
suggested
by
the
government
that
there
is
any
way
you
can
read
the
code
or
the
regulations
which
would
suggest
to
you
that
some
other
reserves
maybe
attributed.
rather
as
i
see
the
reserves
follow
the
risk
test
which
has
been
expounded
here
this
morning.
it’s
sort
of
a
touchstone
which
is
offered
by
the
government
to
better
carry
out
the
statutory
purpose
and
the
argument
is
really
whether
that
new
touchstone
test
can
be
reconciled
with
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that
is
correct
and
of
course
the
initial
insurer
is
also
not
related
to
the
reinsurer
in
our
case.
no
relationship
between
them
at
all,
it
is
an
outside
company.
we
feel
that
applying
this
test
to
penn
security
shows
that
it
is
a
very
unwise
clause
on
the
statute.
penn
security
which
meets
the
statutory
reserve
test
actually
reinsures
more
life
risk
than
accident
and
health
risks,
and
that
arises
because
they
never
sell
accident
and
health
without
life.
they
sometime
sell
life
without
accident
and
health.
in
terms
of
what
it
cost
them
to
carry
the
insurance,
we
have
findings
in
our
case
that
it
requires
company
in
order
to
meet
the
claims
under
the
policies,
it
will
cost
them
more
to
meet
their
life
claims
and
to
meet
their
accident
and
health
claims.
penn
security
has
no
interest
in
the
reserve
funds
which
are
held
by
this
independent
outside
insurer.
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
that
you
can
use
the
word
shifting
in
talking
about
the
reserves
applied
to
the
treaty
one
situation.
those
funds
come
in
from
the
policy
holders
to
the
direct
insurer
and
the
question
is
on
accident
and
health
insurance
when
they
come
over
to
the
direct
insurance
company.
and
in
fact
the
eccentricities
of
the
government
rule
shown
here
by
the
fact
that
we
do
qualify
for
1965
no
matter
what
this
court
says
here
and
indeed
we
have
some
arguments
in
our
brief
that
maybe
i’ll
get
to
which
shows
why
even
if
they
attribute
here.
we’d
still
qualify
as
a
life
insurance
company
and
we
don’t
think
15
years
after
the
event,
this
kind
of
game
should
be
played
with
somebody
who
is
in
clear
compliance
with
the
statute.
perhaps,
if
this
had
been
adopted
as
a
regulation
in
an
earlier
date
a
case
could
be
made
for
it.
now,
the
government
doesn’t
--
does
not
despite
the
use
of
the
word
sham,
does
not
have
any
element
of
sham
in
our
reinsurance
agreement.
this
is
an
outside
company
which
reinsures
and
indeed
they
say
sham
were
not
in
the
case,
we
don’t
get
the
income.
it’s
only
the
reinsurance
which
gets
income.
and
the
government
makes
much
of
the
point
that
under
this
reinsurance
agreement,
all
the
risk
shifts
to
penn
security.
but
that
i
suppose
is
always
true
and
at
least
--
excuse
me
strike
that,
but
the
normal
pattern
of
reinsurance
and
insurance
company
would
like
to
get
rid
of
all
its
risk
under
a
policy
and
it’s
quite
natural
that
if
it
reinsures
it
will
be
taken
off
the
policies
in
term.
it
does
not
want
to
have
the
residual
risk
of
the
catastrophe
which
was
mentioned
here
earlier
and
reinsurance
has
been
around
a
long
time.
these
arguments
which
the
government
now
proposes
would
throw
a
great
monkey
wrench
into
the
reinsurance
business
if
every
time
you
reinsure
a
100%
you
had
to
talk
about
shifting
the
reserve.
and
indeed,
we
submit
and
we
think
that
one
of
the
key
elements
that
tells
the
government
that
it’s
really
trying
to
make
new
law
here
as
this
revenue
ruling
7508
and
that’s
a
life
insurance
case
and
isn’t
directly
involved
here.
but
you’ll
see
there
that
where
the
direct
insurer
actually
paid
over
the
income
on
the
retained
funds
to
the
reinsurer
so
was
a
stronger
cases
sort
of
like
economy
finance
where
it
did
that,
they
still
did
not
require
attribution
of
the
reserves
there
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
there
is
a
regulation
which
would
give
them
license
to.
we
think
this
is
an
ad
hoc
argument
to
try
and
as
a
last
gasp
to
get
at
these
credit
life
insurance
companies.
the
terms
of
the
reinsurance
treaties
at
least
in
this
treaty
one
situation
on
arms
length
deal
between
the
reinsuring
company
and
the
direct
insurer.
and
the
direct
insurer
has
to
make
terms
that
will
make
--
will
let
him
keep
in
the
business
by
paying
the
right
amount
to
the
reinsurer
and
if
he
gets
too
greedy
then
they
will
go
somewhere
else
so
there
is
free
bargaining.
and
i
don’t
believe
that
it
can
be
suggested
any
reason
why
once
you
to
go
into
this
reinsurance
business
you
should
not
be
allowed
to
cast
it
in
terms
which
qualify
you
for
the
taxation
with
congress
has
specified
for
life
insurance
companies.
as
mr.
smith
stated
earlier
it
is
not
argued
here
that
somehow
credit
life
doesn’t
fit
within
the
1959
statute
and
that
is
settled
by
the
alinco
case
and
then
by
the
superior
life
case
in
the
lower
court.
now,
some
focus
is
made
and
rightly
so
on
the
manner
in
which
the
premiums
for
accident
and
health
are
paid.
they
are
done
on
the
–
on
as
unearned
basis
while
life
is
done
on
a
paid
over
directly,
but
this
is
a
term
reached
by
the
party
and
has
several
effects.
one
which
will
be
discussed
more
by
my
following
counsel
is
what
that
does
on
the
ability
of
the
insuring
companies
to
sell
more
insurance.
it
is
important
to
them
to
have
their
reserves
adjusted
as
it
is
always
been
the
case
on
the
handling
of
reinsurance.
there
is
a
tax
impact
and
that’s
what
brings
us
here.
but
between
the
parties,
this
is
perhaps
the
most
important
term
of
the
deal.
if
you
look
at
the
accident
and
health
insurance
and
you
can
work
this
out
on
pencil
and
paper,
if
you
have
a
&
h
policies
that
last
three
years
and
you
get
your
premium
in
advance
from
the
insureds
and
you
keep
that
money
and
you
only
have
to
pay
it
out
once
--
136
for
each
month,
you’ll
find
that
the
calculation
builds
up
a
fund
times
one-and-a-half
--
one-and-a-half
times
the
annual
premium
rate.
and
that
one-and-a-half
times
the
annual
premium
rate
is
--
belongs
to
the
direct
insurer.
he
can
invest
that
and
if
his
rate
of
investment
is
say
5%
you
will
see
that
5%
on
one-and-a-half
times
the
annual
rate
is
a
great
deal
more
than
the
2%
commission
which
appears
on
the
face
of
the
contract.
so,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
provision
for
retaining
the
reserves
on
accident
and
health
is
one
of
the
most
important
provisions
between
the
parties
and
has
tremendous
economic
substance
and
could
certainly
not
be
disregarded
under
any
standards
that
we
have
seen
in
the
past.
now,
our
position
is
that
this
reserve
follow
the
risk
has
no
authority
in
the
statute.
it's
to
be
contrasted
with
section
482
which
does
give
the
commissioner
license
to
do
that.
we
think
it
runs
to
the
extent
the
code
speaks
at
all
on
the
subject
of
attribution
reserves
that
goes
the
other
way
in
section
820.
now,
it’s
not
involved
here,
but
it
seems
a
little
odd
that
if
the
rule
were
as
the
government
claims
here
that
the
reserves
follow
the
risk
that
section
820
would
be
written
just
the
way
it
is.
and
we
find
that
the
government's
attempt
here
runs
afoul
of
four
regulations
requirements.
one,
that
the
premium
--
in
order
to
create
unearned
premium
reserve
the
premiums
must
be
paid
in
advance,
that
is
one
of
the
requirements.
the
second
is
that
it
must
actually
held.
the
third
is
it
has
to
do
--
there
are
two
aspects
to
it
of
being
required
by
the
state
law,
and
finally
whether
if
you
do
go
to
an
attribution
to
this,
you
really
want
to
use
the
gross
a
&
h
premium.
now
in
terms
of
paid
in
advance,
we
don’t
have
any
dispute
that
that
language
in
the
regulations
applies.
the
government
suggests
in
its
reply
brief
that
this
is
satisfied
as
to
penn
security
by
the
fact
that
the
insureds
paid
there
premiums
in
advance
to
the
direct
insurer.
well,
i
think
that’s
an
extraordinary
stretching
of
language.
those
premiums
which
were
paid
in
advance
had
no
relation
to
any
liability
of
penn
security.
its
liability
to
the
direct
insurer
arose
only
when
the
premiums
were
paid
monthly
by
the
direct
insurer
to
penn
security.
if
the
direct
insurer
did
not
pay
those
amounts,
there
would
be
no
liability
in
penn
security
and
if
you
are
looking
in
terms
of
the
regulations,
the
insurance
risk
which
is
referred
to
in
the
regulation
about
paid
in
advance
very
clearly
refers
to
the
reinsurance
risk
which
is
assumed
by
penn
security,
not
the
risk
which
the
direct
insurer
assumes.
now,
we
come
to
the
language
which
says
that
the
reserve
must
be
actually
held
and
that’s
discussed
quite
a
bit
in
the
brief.
the
government
says
reserves
are
sometimes
described
in
colloquial
manner
as
fund
set
aside,
but
that’s
not
the
appropriate
interpretation
and
we
heard
that
this
morning
that
they
should
be
treated
as
liabilities.
well,
we
agree
that
if
you
look
through
the
insurance
text
throughout
the
country
you
can
find
some
terms
which
speak
this
way.
but
we
think
that
the
very
use
of
the
words
actually
held
in
the
regulations
meant
that
the
--
in
drafting
the
terms
and
the
regulations,
it
was
not
suggested
that
anything
other
than
funds
actually
held
would
be
involved.
in
other
words,
they
adopted
what
have
been
described
as
a
colloquial
description
and
insisted
on
it.
if
additional
authority
is
needed,
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
look
at
revenue
ruling
67
180
which
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
irs
has
continued
to
apply
under
1959
act
all
those
early
cases
which
talk
about
funding
a
reserve,
maryland
casualty
being
one
of
the
leading
cases,
they
also
point
out
that
atlas
life
case
was
mentioned
here
earlier
this
morning.
atlas
life
makes
it
very
clear
that
they
are
talking
about
a
funding
of
a
reserve.
and
indeed
if
you
don’t
fund
the
reserve,
you
are
going
to
get
in
a
very
difficult
situation
where
you
create
a
liability
that
will
be
a
very
distorted
picture
of
the
company's
position
unless
some
assets
are
brought
in.
but
let’s
just
go
back
to
the
statutory
language,
even
if
we
concede
that
somehow
you
can
hold
a
liability
as
opposed
to
holding
an
asset
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation,
what
about
the
word
“actually”?
its
a
word
actually
means
anything.
it
must
mean
that
the
company
actually
holds
it,
not
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
can
come
along10
years
later
and
create
a
liability
that
you
didn’t
have.
so,
we
would
think
that
the
word
actually
even
if
he
is
right
about
what
it
means
reserves
are
funded
or
not,
the
word
actually
alone
is
enough
to
keep
the
government
from
proceeding
on
this
case.
there
two
aspects
to
being
required
by
state
law
and
one
of
them
arises
under
801
(c)
(2)
where
the
government
correctly
point
out,
you
can
read
the
statute
and
the
regulations
as
not
requiring
government
approval
under
(c)
2.
but
we
don’t
really
conclude
as
the
government
does
that
hear
alone,
among
all
the
rules
of
insurance
taxation
in
this
very
complicated
section
of
the
code,
in
this
one
place
congress
intended
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
have
a
free
hand
to
go
around
and
make
rules
which
improve
on
what
the
state
authorities
have
done
and
give
him
a
chance
to
make
a
better
tax
law
than
what
the
--
what
would
come
from
following
the
state
regulations.
that
is
just
too
contrary
to
the
rest
of
the
code
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
a
better
reading
is
to
say
that
the
difference
in
language
about
state
requirements
is
to
accommodate
the
decision
in
national
protective
insurance
company
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
there
the
taxpayer
held
the
brief
which
was
at
least
arguably
not
required
by
state
authorities
and
that
case
held
that
it
should
be
included
in
the
reserve
and
we
can
see
removing
the
requirement
that
it'd
be
required
by
state
law
in
order
to
say
if
in
fact
you
have
a
reserve,
you
are
going
to
have
to
include
it
in
the
computation,
whether
or
not
it’s
required
by
state
law.
but
it
is
a
far
cry
to
go
from
that
to
say
that
it
--
this
particular
language
choice
gives
the
commissioner
power
to
do
his
own
creating
of
reserves.
as
is
apparent
from
our
briefs,
and
it
has
been
discussed,
there
is
a
difference
between
gross
and
net
premiums.
accident
and
health
insurance
is
judged
on
the
basis
of
traditionally
in
the
industry
on
gross
premiums
and
that
includes
the
morbidity
risk
which
i
would
beg
to
differ
with
the
government
counsel
is
just
as
well
established
as
mortality
risk.
plus
expenses,
plus
profit
and
in
the
type
of
insurance
we
are
talking
about
here,
the
risk
of
carrying
the
insurance
is
only
1/3
and
if
you
are
going
to
attribute
the
risk,
if
that’s
what
the
government
is
really
after
then
i
think,
you
should
depart
from
the
statutory
adoption
of
the
industry
practice
and
only
attribute
that
port
of
the
risk
which
corresponds
to
the
mortality
risk
in
life
insurance.
because
then
as
we
have
demonstrated
here,
it
would
be
seen
to
this
company
as
a
life
insurance
company
by
that
method
as
well.
our
point
is
that
if
you
depart
from
the
statute
then
it
seems
to
me
you’re
not
bound
by
the
fact
that
states
for
many
purposes
require
using
gross
premium
and
one
particular
reason
which
would
apply
here
is
that
the
direct
insurer
has
the
obligation
to
refund
the
premiums
in
the
event
the
insurance
is
canceled.
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
for
maintaining
the
gross
reserve.
here,
in
our
case
penn
security
is
not
--
once
that
policy
is
canceled
penn
security
never
sees
it
and
the
refund
comes
from
the
direct
insurer.
so
there
would
be
a
very
strong
reason,
if
you
are
really
looking
for
improving
on
the
statutory
test
to
use
net
premiums
in
this
situation.
well,
just
let
me
conclude
and
remind
the
court
of
just
how
predominantly
this
company
is
an
insurance
company
because
of
the
fact
that
it
