this

life
insurance

the

the
way
that
you
described
that
the
initial
or
sometimes
you
referred
to
as
the
direct
insurer
is
essentially
like
a
general
agent
in
the
field
who
receives
the
commission
for
initiating
the
business
whereas
the
risk
taking
is
by
the
reinsure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
your
view
mr.
smith
on
a
contract
of
risk
sharing
where
hypothetically
half
of
the
risk
was
reinsured?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
the
initial
insurer,
concerning
which
i
inquired
before,
would
be
something
more
than
a
general
agent,
wouldn’t
he?

justice

holder
and

beneficiary
on
the
one
hand
and
the
reinsurer?

privily
is
between
the
initial
