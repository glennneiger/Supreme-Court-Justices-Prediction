mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
heldman
and
i
have
a
divided
argument
persuading
to
a
permission
of
the
court
and
i
will
speak
for
approximately
15
minutes
and
we
will
provide
the
court
with
a
brief
outline
of
the
case
and
will
devote
my
arguments
to
the
questions
of
federal
preemption
and
implied
private
rights.
mr.
heldman
will
argue
the
issues
involving
third-party
beneficiary
status,
whatever
time
remains
after
our
argument,
we
would
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
i
believe
that
it
was
raised
throughout
the
case
your
honor
in
terms
of
being
beneficiaries
of
the
safety
covenants
in
the
grant
agreements
and
being
able
to
sue
as
third-party
benefits
--
to
sue
for
breach
of
those
grant
agreements
as
third-party
beneficiaries.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
yes
sir,
i
am
speaking
of
an
implied
cort
versus
ash
type
of
claim
based
upon
breach
of
these
safety
covenants
in
the
grant
agreements.
the
safety
covenants
in
the
grant
agreements
are
also
statutorily
imposed
safety
covenants
under
the
federal
airport
act.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
if
we
wanted
to
possibly
split
hairs,
they
would
be
two
different
theories,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
i
believe
it
was
probably
in
the
fifth
circuit
your
honor,
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
turned
a
question
on
federal
law.
these
cases
may
it
please
the
court
arise
from
the
crash
of
lear
jet
airplane
at
the
dekalb-peachtree
airport
airport,
caused
by
ingestion
of
large
number
of
starlings
in
both
jet
engines.
the
starlings
had
been
attracted
to
the
airport
by
an
open
raw
garbage
dump
maintained
by
the
county
alongside
the
only
jet
runway
at
the
airport
and
this
garbage
dump
had
been
in
existence
for
sometime
and
as
the
record
reflects
was
an
attraction
to
literally
huge
flocks
of,
tens
of
thousands
of
starlings
to
the
jet
runway
area.
prior
to
the
crash
and
under
the
(inaudible)
of
the
federal
airport
act
and
related
regulations
of
the
county
and
the
faa,
had
in
and
into
a
series
of
six
grant
agreements,
where
about
the
county
had
received
federal
funds
for
airport
improvements,
including
construction
of
the
very
jet
runway
in
question
in
this
case.
these
grant
agreements
imposed
upon
the
county,
the
following
specifics
safety
covenants.
one;
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
airport
in
a
condition
‘safe
for
aeronautical
users,’
two;
restriction
of
airport
property
to
uses
compatible
with
normal
airport
operations
including
‘landing
and
takeoff
of
airplanes’,
three;
prohibition
of
any
activity
at
the
airport
that
would
interfere
with
its
use
for
airport
purposes
and
four
and
possibly…
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
airport
purposes,
excuse
me
your
honor
and
possibly
the
most
important
is
four;
mitigation
and
removal
of
existing
airport
hazards
and
airport
hazards
being
defined
by
federal
law,
as
anything
that
adversely
affects
safety
of
life.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
these
were
recitals
in
the
grant
agreements
between
the
faa
and
the
county
and
they
are
also
statutory
requirements
under
the
federal
airport
act.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
yes
sir,
they
come
into
the
contract
because
congress
required
them
to
be
there.
the
petitioners
based
their
claims
against
the
county
on
basically
four
theories;
negligent
operation
of
the
airport,
maintenance
of
a
nuisance,
maintenance
of
a
federally
prescribed
airport
hazard,
which
is
the
implied
private
claim,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
we
claim
we
have
and
breach
of
the
grant
agreement
safety
covenants.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
we
have
both
types
of
jurisdiction
here,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
have
complete
diversity
jurisdiction
and
if
we
have
federally
protected
rights
then
we
have
federal
questions
jurisdiction
also.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
the
issues
here
therefore
are
whether…
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
we
do
not
have
a
federal
question
type
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
yes
sir,
with
respect
to
our
argument
based
upon
federal
preemption,
we
wish
to
make
these
points.
a
federal
safety
regulation
of
aeronautical
interstate
commerce
extends
to
practically
all
phases
of
aviation
and
it
specifically
includes
federally
funded
airports.
the
primary
purpose
of
federal
regulation
of
aviation
including
the
safety
covenants
involved
here
is
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
interstate
aeronautical
travelers.
the
extensive
and
pervasive
federal
regulation
of
aeronautical
commerce
by
a
necessity
must
preempt
and
preclude
any
conflicting
local
laws
of
policies.
this
is
simply
a
logical
extension
of
this
court’s
rulings
in
northwest
airlines,
inc.
versus
minnesota,
and
city
of
burbank
versus
lockheed
air
terminal.
application
of
a
local
county
immunity
law,
to
shield
the
county
for
liability
for
breaches
of
safety
covenants
imposed
by
congress,
certainly
does
absolutely
nothing
pollster
or
enhance
the
federally
expressed
concerns
for
airport
safety.
to
the
contrary,
shielding
the
county
from
liability
can
serve
only
to
emasculate
and
burden
the
federally
expressed
concern
for
aeronautical
safety
and
for
safety
at
federally
funded
airports.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
a
lower
court
your
honor
has
held
that
the
state
would
have
sovereign
immunity,
in
a
different
factual
situation
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
aeronautical
commerce
and
the
extensive
federal
regulations
of
aeronautical
commerce
and
the
deep
concern
of
the
federal
government
with
safety
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
example
your
honor
i
have
just
cited.
however
a
lower
court
has
held
as
recited
briefs
that
sovereign
immunity
would
exist
under
the
limited
example,
your
honor
i
have
just
gave.
so
it
is
our
position
that
the
doctrine
of
federal
preemption
here
must
preempt
the
county’s
immunity
because
otherwise
the
safety
objectives
of
the
covenants
would
be
completely
forted.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
well,
no
sir
we
that
is
quite
not
correct
justice
stevens.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
no
sir,
the
district
court
ruled
against
us.
the
original
fifth
circuit
opinion
ruled
in
our
favor
and
it
was
only
really
until
we
got
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
to
the
en
banc
majority
opinion
that
the
question
of
federal
common
law
really
became
involved
in
the
case.
well,
the
parties
had
overlooked
it
or
whether
the
earlier
courts
had
overlooked
it
remains
to
be
same.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
our
position
that
georgia’s
law
of
third-party
beneficiaries
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
federal
law
should
be
under
cort
versus
ash
under
the
original
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
anyone
who
is
an
intended
beneficiary
of
a
safety
covenant
can
sue
for
breach
of
contract
and
that
such
principle
applies
to
counties.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
no
sir,
i
believe
the
georgia
law
has
been
stated
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
and
is
untouched
by
any
reversal
and
that
is
that
a
county
has
no
immunity
will
respect
the
claims
arising
from
contracts.
it
was
lawfully
authorized
to
me.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
yes,
sir.
but
judge
dyer
did
not
disagreed
with
judge
morgan’s
comments
that
a
georgia
county
can
be
sued
for
breach
of
any
contract,
that
was
lawfully
authorized
to
me.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
that
aspect
of
the
panel
decision
is
in
effect
because
it
is
in
part
i,
ii,
and
iv
of
the
panel
decision
that
was
adopted
by
the
en
banc
majority.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
turn
now
briefly
to
the
subject
of
our
equal
protection
argument
which
was
first
made
it
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
it
is
basically
an
argument
that
application
of
county
immunity
here
or
any
interpretation
of
the
county
immunity
statute
would
work
the
denial
of
equal
protection.
we
have
this
situation,
under
the
classification
scheme
urged
by
dekalb
county.
if
the
county
seat
of
dekalb
county,
the
city
of
decatur
had
operated
this
airport,
we
would
not
be
involved
here.
there
would
be
no
immunity
issue.
so,
the
result
of
the
classification
scheme
urged
by
the
county
is
simply
that
some
suits
against
some
local
governmental
entities
can
be
allowed
but
other
suits
against
it
practical
identical
local
government
entities
will
respect
to
identical
airports
or
disallowed.
we
believe
this
is
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
rights
of
interstate
aeronautical
travelers
and
which
serve
to
deny
them
equal
protection.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
respond
briefly
to
council’s
arguments,
that
the
county
has
immunity
of
the
contracts
claims.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
alright,
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
(inaudible)
your
friend’s
time.
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
thank
you.
on
page
a
22
(a)
of
our
petition
for
sir,
we
incorporated
the
decisions
in
the
courts
below
and
i
want
to
call
attention
to
this
court
to
the
facts
that
in
the
initial
panel
opinion
judge
morgan
of
the
fifth
circuit
said,
talking
about
the
southern
airways
versus
dekalb
county
case
involving
this
precise
airport,
the
court
rule
is
since
the
georgia
uniform
airport
law
expressly
authorizes
a
county
to
contract,
“the
logical
inference
of
that
statute
is
that
the
county
maybe
sued
for
breach
of
contract.
this
is
consistent
with
several
other
georgia
decisions
which
hold
that
statutory
authority
to
contract
is
necessarily
a
statutory
waiver
of
immunity
to
suit
for
breach.”
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
the
contract
in
this
case
was
a
contract
authorized
by
the
uniform
airport’s
law
which
is
same
type
of
contract
we
have
here
your
honor,
of
faa,
grant
agreement.
so
the
georgia
law
on
immunity
is
that,
“immunity
for
a
county
does
not
extend
to
suits
based
upon
contractual
obligations.”
and
as
mr.
bush
had
pointed
out…
mr.
j.
arthur
mozley
no,
sir
the
majority
in
the
footnote
simply
said,
“we
believe
that
under
georgia
law,
the
result
would
be
the
same
because
under
georgia
law,
these
petitioners
are
not
indented
beneficiaries.
it
was
question
of
whether
we
were
intended
beneficiaries
not
an
immunity
question.
thank
you.
