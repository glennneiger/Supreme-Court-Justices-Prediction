unknown
speaker
if
you
had
a
highway
negligently
built
but
with
a
federal
grant
of
money
and
joint
construction
project
of
the
state
and
federal
government,
will
the
state
in
these
circumstances
be
liable
in
charge
or
will
it
have
sovereign
immunity
for
the
negligence,
maintenance
or
construction
of
highways?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
take
then
your
position
includes
the
notion
that
the
federal
law
of
government’s
has
controversy
and
you
think
that
court
of
appeals
simply
made
a
mistake
in
saying
that
you
were
not
entitled
to
sue
under
federal
law
here.
unknown
speaker
that
is
exactly
the
opposite
position
for
what
you
took
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeal.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
won
in
the
district
court
on
georgia
law,
did
not
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
that
you
would
not
if
georgia,
would
you
concede
that
if
georgia
--
what
is
your
position
if
georgia
law
applies
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
which
law
governs,
i
suppose
we
would
be
remand
to
see
what
the
georgia
law
is.
unknown
speaker
so,
judge
morgan
took
one
position
kind
of
had
a
detailed
analysis,
judge
dyer
took
another
position
with
a
much
less
detailed
analysis
at
georgia
law.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
that
panel
decision
is
still
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
it
is
simply
your
third-party
beneficiary
theory,
is
not
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
would
not
raise
an
airport
without
federal
approval?
unknown
speaker
could
not
it
be
withdrawn,
could
not
it
have
been
withdrawn?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
your
argument
is
that
this
immunity
did
it,
federal
government
had
little
responsibility
to
that
too,
did
not
it?
unknown
speaker
well
let
us
assume
it,
is
not
the
--
assume,
it's
a
federal
question,
but
let
us
assume
that
the
georgia
law
is
that
the
county
is
immune
from
contract
claims.
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
that
georgia
law
is
that
the
county
is
immune
also
from
contract
claim.
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
but
let
us
assume
we
decided
on
the
one
hand
that
federal
law
governs
this
case.
well,
then
we
are
faced
with
the
problem
that…
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
immunity
of
the
county?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
this
is
not
a
11th
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
suit
still
pending?
unknown
speaker
and
you
sued
there
under
the
$10,000
limit
of
the…
unknown
speaker
federal
tort
claims
act.
unknown
speaker
no
that
was
your
--
did
you
make
any
assertions
in
the
district
court
or
lower
courts
as
what
the
controlling
law
was
in
that
action?
unknown
speaker
am
i
reading
the
wrong
compliant
on
as
large
the
joint
appendix
page
nine,
is
that
where
the
complaint
begins?
unknown
speaker
jurisdiction
is
based
on
1346(b).
is
that
it,
is
that
the
tort
claims
act?
unknown
speaker
any
reason
you
know
why
the
united
states
is
not
here?
unknown
speaker
but
the
breadth
of
the
potential
of
these
issues
is
such
that
i
wonder
that
the
united
states
is
not
in
front
of
the
court
giving
there
views
at
the
matter.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
are
asserting
that
a
liability
against
them,
your…
unknown
speaker
even
if
you
lost
here,
you
still
have
your
suit
against
the
unites
states.
unknown
speaker
would
it
include
the
failure
of
the
united
states
to
close
this
airport
down
as
a
hazardous
place
on
your
theory
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
heldman,
i
hate
to
ask
this
question,
but
is
there
a
case
still
pending
in
the
district
court
against
united
states
and
if
there
is,
was
there
a
ruled
order
entered
pursuant
to
rule
54
(b)
making
this
a
proper
appeal?
unknown
speaker
just
one
question,
you
mentioned
the
pardon
case,
do
you
consider
the
operation
of
railroad
in
pardon
as
a
complete
parallel
to
the
federal
regulation
of
all
airports?
unknown
speaker
but
these
cases
are
still
pending
against
some
other
parties…
unknown
speaker
54
(b)
has
anything
to
do
with
that?
unknown
speaker
and
did
the
district
court
say
there
was
not
any
reason
for
delay?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bush,
are
you
arguing
if
we
should
conclude
that
georgia
law
controls
that
we
should
decide
the
georgia
law
question
or
should
we
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
clear
that
the
majority
of
the
panel
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
disagreement
they
squarely
held
against
to
you.
unknown
speaker
that
maybe
the
third-party,
in
most
case
maybe
related
to
the
third-party
beneficiary
matter
but
is
that
the
same
question
as
immunity?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
thought
we
think
so
and
what
about
the
georgia
law
and
immunity
of
the
county?
unknown
speaker
the
fifth
circuit
does
not
seem
to
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
what
about
we
non-georgia
judges?
unknown
speaker
what
if
we
decided
that
federal
law
applies,
then
what
about
immunity?
unknown
speaker
state
sovereignty,
what
about
this
county
immunity?
that
is
not
state.
unknown
speaker
maybe,
but
still
a
state
is
not
in
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
but
the
county
immunity
is
certainly
in
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well
california
made
that
argument
in
moor
v.
alameda
county
too
and
we
rejected
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the
state
could
surely
just
decline
to
appropriate
the
money.
unknown
speaker
mccord
case
cited
in
your
agreement.
unknown
speaker
anybody
get
rid
of
that
nuisance
of
this
airport,
if
the
county
has
immune.
unknown
speaker
if
the
county
had
to
pay
a
few
million
dollars
in
damages
they
might
get
interest.
