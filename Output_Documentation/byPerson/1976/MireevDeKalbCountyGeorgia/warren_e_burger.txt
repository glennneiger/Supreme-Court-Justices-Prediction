we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
76-607,
miree
against
dekalb
county
and
the
three
consolidated
related
cases.
mr.
mozley
you
may
proceed,
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
implied
private
rights,
do
you
mean
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
airport
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
you
address
yourself
somewhere
in
your
argument
to
where
that
was
first
raised.
i
have
read
that
district
court
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
i
find
no
hint
in
either
of
them
that
that
was
ever
raised.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
simply
talking
then
when
you
say
implied
right
of
action,
you
mean
a
third-party
beneficiary
claim
not
an
implied
cort
versus
ash
type
of
claim.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
they
two
different
theories
of
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
if
you
have
time
to
say
when
you
first
raised
your
cort
versus
ash
claim.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
air
force?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
these
recitals
in
the
statute,
these
are
the
conditions
on
which
the
federal
government
makes
the
grant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
come
into
the
contract
because
they
are
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
federal
question
jurisdiction
is
linked
entirely
to
your
claim
of
an
implied
cause
of
action,
i
think
if
you
do
not
have
an
implied
cause
of
action
then
you
do
not
have
a
federal…
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
heldman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
talking
about
page
22
of
the
big
of
the
big
joint
appendix.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
page
21.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
airport
or
the
garbage
dump?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
in
terms
of
immunity
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
contract
claim,
do
you
have
to
rely
on
the
panel
decision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
not
that
georgia
statute
entitled
to
some
kind
of
credits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
have
just
said
some
kind
of
credit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
has
never
been
any
question
about
the
power
to
waive
the
immunity
and
many
states
have
indeed
waived…
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
said
the
united
states
also?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
was
on
the
old
concept
for
the
proprietary
aspect
of
the
railroad,
was
it
not
in
part.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
do
well
if
you
can
avoid
questions
by
a
statement
like
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
certainly
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mozley,
your
time
has
actually
expired
but
we
will
give
you
till
12
o’clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
contract
was
he
referring
to
do
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
en
banc
majority
and
a
footnote
disagree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rehnquist.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you,
mr.

rehnquist.
