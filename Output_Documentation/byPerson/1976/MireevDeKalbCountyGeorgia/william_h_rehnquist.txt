justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
the
district
court
then
refer
to
your
claim
as
a
diversity
suit
in
the
fifth
circuit
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do
not
doubt
it,
but
all
i
am
saying
is
the
district
court
opinion
refers
to
it
as
diversity
litigation,
the
fifth
circuit
refers
to
it
as
diversity
litigation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
would
still
remain
with
complete
diversity
of
jurisdiction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
theory
of
an
implied
cause
of
action,
the
federal
airport
act
certainly
might
develop
principles
that
could
involve
the
united
states
as
the
defendant,
could
not
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
legal
principles
involved
in
this
case
probably
will
not
be
regarded
by
scholars
as
being
of
the
first
magnitude.
the
facts
are
a
good
deal
more
interesting
than
the
facts
of
many
cases
which
this
court
decides.
dekalb
county,
georgia
is
located
in
the
suburban
atlanta
area
and
it
operated
the
dekalb
peachtree
airport.
it
also
operated
a
large
garbage
dump
located
adjacent
to
the
airport.
as
might
be
expected,
the
garbage
dump
attracted
a
number
of
birds.
in
1973,
a
learjet
crashed
shortly
after
takeoff
from
the
airport.
the
alleged
caused
of
the
crash
was
the
ingestion
into
the
craft's
engine
of
a
large
number
of
birds
swarming
from
the
dump.
as
might
be
imagined,
the
lawsuits
came
think
and
fast.
the
issue
which
has
finally
reached
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
whether
the
right
of
the
plaintiffs
in
these
various
lawsuits
to
sue
the
dekalb
county
as
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
a
contract
with
the
government
should
be
determined
under
georgia
law
or
under
what
is
called
federal
common
law.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
held
that
the
decision
should
be
under
federal
common
law.
we
reversed
that
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
although
the
contract
on
which
the
plaintiffs
are
claiming
as
third
party
beneficiaries
involves
the
federal
aviation
administration,
"no
rights
of
the
united
states
are
in
jeopardy
as
a
result
of
the
plaintiff's
third
party
beneficiary
claims
against
dekalb
county."
and
so,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
send
it
back
to
that
court
for
determination
of
plaintiff's
third
party
beneficiary
rights
under
georgia
law.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
