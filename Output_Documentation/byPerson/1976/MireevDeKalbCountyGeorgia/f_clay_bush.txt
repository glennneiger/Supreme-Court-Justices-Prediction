mr.
f.
clay
bush
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
dekalb
county
and
there
are
multitude
question
that
this
court
has
presented,
but
let
me
go
ahead
with
what
i’ve
prepared
as
and
it
will
probably
bring
in
some
of
the
question
which
you
all
have
raised
to
the
various
opposing
council.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
let
me
point
out
that
in
the
initial
panel
opinion,
as
raised
by
the
dissent
by
a
circuit
judge
dyer.
he
stated
in
a
footnote
that
if
georgia
law
applied
to
this
case,
it
would
change
the
result
and
that
footnote
along
with
the
dissenting
opinion
was
adopted,
by
eight
judges
of
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
we
are
here
before
this
court
today,
not
on
any
54
(b)
certification,
we
are
here
because
the
judgment
entered
for
dekalb
county.
an
appeal
was
taken
from
that
judgment
in
approximately
late
september,
1974.
two
opinions
were
entered
by
district
judge
william
c.
o’kelley,
the
first
one
in
june
of
74
and
in
that
first
one;
he
basically
stated
his
opinion
that
dekalb
county
was
immune
from
suit
if
the
diversity
law
applied.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
there
was
mr.
mozley
who
is
here
to
argue
about
on
behalf
of
fireman's
fund,
southeast
machinery
and
machinery
buyers,
the
various
defendants
and
plaintiffs
he
represents
in
dual
positions,
a
motion
for
reconsideration.
the
court
reconsidered
it,
entered
its
opinion
on
i
believe
september
25,
1974.
then
entered
judgment
for
dekalb
county
by
which
an
appeal
was
taken.
there
are
no
cross-claims
we
contend
pending
against
this
right
now,
the
suit
is
here
upon
a
proper
judgment
entered
on
behalf
of
dekalb
county
and
it
was
appealed…
mr.
f.
clay
bush
he
did
entered
pursuant
to
54
(b)
we
directed
the
clerk
to
enter
judgment
on
behalf
on
dekalb
county
and
judgment
was
entered
and
it
is
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
now,
if
i
may
proceed…
mr.
f.
clay
bush
i
believe
he
may
have
your
honor,
but
a
judgment
was
entered,
in
his
opposition.
it
was
not
meant
to
subsequently
to
delete
one
individual.
they
had
been
included
in
which
should
not
been.
if
this
court
should
consider
georgia
law,
we
would
direct
this
court’s
attention
to
particularly
the
decisions
that
have
occurred,
since
judge
william
c.
o’kelley
who
we
contend
had
his
pulse
upon
georgia
law
and
we
would
show
this
court
that
in
january
of
1975,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
azizi
and
in
shelly
had
before
the
situation
where
they
were
going
to
review
the
constitutional
immunity
doctrine
again.
there,
they
had
situations
and
occurrences
and
acts
that
have
occurred
before
the
constitutionalization
of
this
immunity
rule
and
here
they
said,
that
it
is
no
longer
open
to
abrogation
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
because
it
is
a
matter
that
has
been
a
part
the
constitution
of
georgia,
it
has
been
ratified
by
the
people,
it
has
been
passed
by
the
legislature
of
georgia,
has
been
examined
by
the
executive
branch,
the
state
government
of
georgia.
therefore,
it
is
no
longer
open
to
the
judicial
abrogation
by
georgia
court
or
by
a
construing
georgia
law.
now,
in
the
later
part
of
january
of
1975,
in
william
v.
georgia
power,
it
was
a
matter
involving
hancock
county
and
in
that
case
there
had
been
allegation
of
nuisance
and
allegation
of
third-party
intended
to
beneficiary,
to
an
agreement
between
georgia
power
and
hancock
county,
in
the
plaintiff
said
that
they
were
third-party
beneficiaries.
supreme
court
of
georgia
said,
“no,
immunity”
to
both
third-party
beneficiary
and
to
theories
of
nuisance.
in
october
of
75,
in
revels
versus
tift
county,
we
had
a
slip
and
fall,
a
simple
negligence
action
in
a
county
court
house
of
the
tift
county,
no
immunity.
in
march
of
1976,
now
this
was
after
the
panel
opinion,
where
we
strenuously
disagreed
with
what
judge
morgan
stated,
as
what
he
considered
to
be
the
law
of
georgia
on
third-party
beneficiary.
approximately
two
months
after
that
panel
opinion,
in
march
of
76
in
a
case
of
backus
versus
chilivis
,
there
was
a
situation
where
a
person
had
contacted
with
glynn
county
georgia,
which
is
down
near
brunswick
and
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
said,
“why
am
a
third-party
beneficiary
of
that
contract?”
supreme
court
said,
“no,
that
person
was
not
an
intended
beneficiary”
and
it
stated
that
no
citizen
is
a
third-party
beneficiary
of
the
government
contract.
then
more
recently,
in
february
of
this
year,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
a
state
department
of
the
state
government
of
georgia,
contracting
with
the
health
facilities
services
on
medicaid
payments,
they
promulgate
certain
regulations
wherein
they
say
that,
there
are
maximum
reimbursement
sealing
and
these
maximum
reimbursement
sealing
cause
them
some
money
and
plaintiff
sued
and
supreme
court
of
georgia
said,
“i
am
sorry,
we
have
immunity.
you’ve
sued
the
state
in
that
particular
instance,
the
state
has
not
agreed
to
pay
you
damages
or
waive
its
immunity
and
since
it
stands
before
us
with
immunity,
we
must
apply
it.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
i
do
not
really
seek
to
advice
the
court
on
which
position
it
should
take,
it
is
clear
to
me
your
honor
that
georgia
law,
if
it
is
applied
by
this
court
or
by
the
fifth
circuit,
we
would
clearly
hold
dekalb
county
immune
from
the
suit
and
as
well
as
the
third-party
beneficiary
arguments
would
find
that
the
county…
mr.
f.
clay
bush
there
was
some
disagreement
and
it
was…
mr.
f.
clay
bush
well,
they
squarely
held
on
the
theory
of
applying
two
cases
which
those
two
cases
were
subsequently
two
months
later
in
backus
versus
chilivis
distinguished.
they
applied
a
case
called
smith
v.
ledbetter
bros.
which
was
a
case
where
they
suit
a
person
who
had
done
some
roadway
construction
and
a
highway
traveler
as
a
suggestion
of
chief
justice
was
injured
and
they
sued
the
individual
who
had
actually
done
the
work
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
georgia
said,
“well
that
was
a
proper
theory
of
recovery.”
now,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
that
was
a
fairly
old
case,
and
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
march
of
76
said,
“that
case,
it
simply
does
not
apply
this
is
ensuing
people
who
have
contracted
with
the
government
or
the
government
itself.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
we
contend
it
is
two
fold
your
honor.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
we
contend
your
honor
that
we
are
still
immune
particularly
because
of
the
constitutionalization
of
immunity
rule
that
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it
is
now
a
situation
and
as
expressed
in
october
75
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
revels
versus
tift
county
that
was
a
specific
case
where
there
was
a
slip
and
fall
in
the
county
court
house
and
a
simple
negligence
action
against
tift
county
and
they
said,
“county
is
now
immune
from
suing
and
its
(inaudible).
mr.
f.
clay
bush
there
was
also
a
member
of
the
majority
opinion,
who
adopted
that
footnote
of
judge
dyer
that,
judge
haire
(ph)
was
also
a
georgia
judge.
so,
we
have
a
situation
where
one
georgia
judge
from
the
fifth
circuit
was
saying
one
thing
and
one
georgia
judge
was
saying
another.
but
i
will
state
to
you
your
honor,
that
a
panel
opinion…
mr.
f.
clay
bush
i
would
suggest
to
you
your
honor
that
the
panel
opinion
failed
to
their
cognizance
and
failed
to
realize
after
the
panel
opinion
and
when
the
time
of
the
en
banc
of
the
opinion
was
written
of
the
backus
versus
chilivis
decision,
i
would
as
simply
commend
that
to
your
honor’s
attention.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
we
have
contend
your
honor,
there
is
no
case
that
i
have
seen
from
this
court
that
deals
with
that
issue.
there
is
a
fifth
circuit
case
called
mccord
versus
dixie
aviation,
which
says
that
states
sovereignty
is
unimpaired
in
the
aviation
area.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
call
your
honor’s
attention
to
a
decision
of…
mr.
f.
clay
bush
well
your
honor
it
is
our
contention
that
it
is
not
only
a
state
statutory
immunity
but
it
is
a
state
constitutional
immunity…
mr.
f.
clay
bush
well,
it
was
our
position
in
the
brief
and
it
is
still
our
position…
mr.
f.
clay
bush
well,
we
are
not
suggesting
the
state
of
georgia
is
involved
in
this
case.
we
are
suggesting
that
multitude.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
well,
we
would
completely
agree
that
the
lincoln
county
v.
luning
is
positive
of
that
issue.
in
that
particular
case
and
i
reviewed
that
lincoln
county,
it
was
a
particular
county
in
nevada,
i
believe,
your
honor
and
that
was
a
county
that
was
apparently
drafted
as
a
municipality
as
in
georgia.
in
georgia
counties
are
considered
arms
of
the
state.
we
decided
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
decision
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
well,
it
is
my
position
also
as
well
that
these
are
situations
where
the
allegations
multiply
even
of
these
present
petitioners
is
into
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars,
as
far
as
damaged
suits
and
this
is
simply
a
situation
where
the
county
has
no
capability
and
we
would
have
no
capability
under
the
government
immune
to
pay
for
such
judgments
and
a
plead
would
have
to
be
made
to
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
to
pay
these
judgments
and
there
under
edelman
v.
jordan
in
your
honor’s
opinion,
we
may
commend
to
the
eleventh
amendment
because
the
state
maybe
called
upon
through
its
general
treasury
to
pay
for
these
particular
judgments.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
they
certainly
could
your
honor,
but
that
would
be
their
decision
in
our
regard
but
i
am
not
completely
agreeing
that
eleventh
amendment
is
not
applied.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
it
is,
your
honor.
you
have
it,
even
i
have
mine.
mine
is
red
color,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
i
do
not
agree
that
what
mr.
heldman
said
that,
the
suggestion
is
that
the
county
refused
to
doing
anything
about,
because
they
were
immune.
the
county
all
during
this
time
was
trying
to
find
the
place
to
put
its
county
garbage.
it
is
a
semi-urban
county
and
it’s
a
situation
where
no
one
in
the
county
wants
the
garbage
dumped
next
door
to
them.
it
is
a
situation
of
placement
disposal
of
garbage.
mr.
f.
clay
bush
it
certainly
might
your
honor.
it
is
already
been
alleviated.
let
me
point
out
to
the
court
as
to
the
federal
question
that’s
present.
this
court
through
justice
stewart
unanimously
held
in
a
case
that
i
by
my
own
mistake
have
not
directed
this
court’s
attention
to,
a
case
called
executive
jet
aviation
versus
city
of
cleveland.
that
is
409
us,
249
and
34
l.ed.
454.
that
case
also
was
a
bird
ingestion
case.
in
that
case,
there
was
charter
flight
arising
of
cleveland,
ohio
and
it
took
off
and
start
off
towards
lake
erie
and
ingested
some
goals
crashed
in
lake
erie.
a
suit
was
filed
ohio
federal
court.
not
alleging
diversity
because
there
was
no
diversity.
they
filed
to
base
upon
theory
of
admiralty
and
upon
the
theory
of
the
death
of
the
high
seas
act
for
obvious
reasons;
there
is
no
federal
wrongful
death
action,
explicit
in
any
of
the
aviation
statutes.
this
court
dealt
greatly
with
the
admiralty
questions
but
at
the
conclusion
of
dealing
with
the
admiralty
issues,
i
think
justice
stewart
for
unanimous
court
made
an
expression
that
is
completely
applicable
to
this
case
and
to
the
federal
issues
that
have
been
raised.
in
the
situation
before
us
which
is
only
fortuitously
and
incidentally
connected
to
navigable
waters
and
which
bears
no
relationship
to
traditional
maritime
activity.
the
ohio
courts
could
plainly
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
suit
and
could
plainly
apply
familiar
concepts
of
ohio
tort
law
without
any
effect
on
maritime
endeavors.
it
may
be
as
petitioners
argued,
that
aviation
tort
cases
should
be
governed
by
uniform
substantive
and
procedural
laws
and
it
such
action
should
be
heard
in
the
federal
courts
so
as
to
avoid
the
diversion
results
and
duplicities
litigation
in
multiparty
cases.
if
federal
uniformity
is
the
desired
goal
with
respect
to
claims
arising
from
aviation
accidents,
congress
is
free
under
the
commerce
clause
to
enact
legislation
applicable
to
all
such
accidents
whether
occurring
on
land
or
water
and
adapted
to
the
specific
circumstances
of
their
commerce.
i
cite
also
with
regards
to
that
a
bill
that
was
introduced
by
senator
tydings
in
1969.
i
have
cited
in
my
brief.
senator
tydings
suggested
in
his
bill
thought
that
there
should
be
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction,
a
federal
cause
of
action
and
a
federal
remedy
for
aviation
act.
the
case
though
had
substantial
testimony
in
hearings
was
never
reported
out
of
committee.
it
never
got
anywhere.
the
reason
is
because
there
is
a
body
of
state
law
to
apply
and
we
contend
that
this
state
law
protects
us
in
this
respect.
again,
the
suggestion
that
there
are
safety
requirements
that
these
safety
requirements
should
be
recognized
by
this
court
and
thus
create
a
private
cause
of
action.
congress
has
that
right.
congress
has
that
ability
and
congress
has
not
created
a
private
cause
of
action,
a
private
remedy.
private
remedy
for
wrongful
death,
which
is
unrecognized
and
we
contend
this
court
should
not
imply
such
a
remedy
from
a
sovereign
legislation
and
in
an
executive
jet
aviation
case,
they
refused
to,
in
a
bird
ingestion
case.
the
citation
of
the
city
of
englewood
case,
we
contend
this,
out
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
alleged
conflict
in
the
federal
circuits
between
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
circuit
that
city
of
englewood
case
is
an
eminent
domain
case.
they
recite
particular
facts.
there
was
no
injuries
involved,
no
wrongful
death,
nothing
such
as
that
and
they
also
distinguished
because
they
say
that
non
aeronautical
users
were
involved.
here
these
people
contend,
they
are
aeronautical
users.
so
they
recite
those
authority
cases
that
do
not
even
have
a
factual
basis
really.
are
there
any
other
question?
we
are
nearing
12
and
out.
but
i
am
concluded
with
my
argument;
if
the
court
has
any
other
questions.
thank
you,
your
honor
very
much.
