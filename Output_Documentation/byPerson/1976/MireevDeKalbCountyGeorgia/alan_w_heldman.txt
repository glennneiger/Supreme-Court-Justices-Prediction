mr.
alan
w.
heldman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
miree
petitioners,
there
are
three
minor
children
whose
father
and
mother
were
both
killed
as
passengers
on
this
airplane.
they
are
from
birmingham,
the
crash
took
place
near
atlanta.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
responding
if
i
may
to
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
yours
mr.
justice
white
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
federal
law
was
asserted
below
and
whether
the
notion
of
an
implied
federal
remedy
was
asserted
below
and
i
think
i
responded
to
this
on
the
first
page
or
so
of
our
reply
brief
but
most
specifically
i
can
refer
you
to
joint
appendix
at
page
21
which
is
part
of
our
complaint
and
i
am
assured
by
our
council
in
the
related
cases
that
there
was
similar
language
there.
at
page
21
in
the
record,
we
asserted
that
the
maintenance
of
the
garbage
dumped
at
the
airport
constituted
an
airport
hazard
is
defined
in
several
recited
sections,
at
section
1711
is
the
definition
of
airport
hazard
but
1718(3)
requires
the
aerial
approaches
will
be
protected
and
that
adjacent
land
use
should
not
be
incompatible.
we
think
that
is
more
than
adequate
assertion
of
federal
remedies
for...
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
your
honor,
it
has
no
relationship
to
the
third-party
beneficiary
argument
and
in
the
context
of
the
paragraphs
of
the
complaint,
it
is
unrelated.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
original
complaint
asserted
to
cover
the
waterfront;
we
argued
the
tort,
nuisance
contract,
pleaded
rather.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
page
21
your
honor.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
paragraph
28,
there
on.
and
those
section
references
are
to
the
specific
federal
statutory
requirements,
that
areal
approach
is
being
protected
and
that
adjacent
land
not
reused
incompatibly,
it
had
in
mind
various
sort
of
situation
that
we
have
here.
the
county
own
this
airport,
the
county
maintain
an
open
garbage
dump
literally
adjacent
to
the
runway
and
over
a
period
of
years,
they
were
told
by
the
faa
that
they
were
getting
reports
of
flocks
of
birds
interfering
with
aerial
navigation,
there
were
actual
reports
made
from
the
faa
that
the
county
of
birds
striking
airplane
yet
not
with
fatal
result
and
what
we
have
is
a
apathetic
response
not
to
say
a
hostile
response
from
the
county.
why?
simply,
because
the
county
deemed
itself
to
be
immune
and
there
was
no
adequate
sanction
to
make
them
take
notice
of
this
problem.
so,
it
is
not
positioned
that
the
immunity
here
calls
these
deaths.
immunity
created
an
apathetic
attitude
with
respect
to
ignoring
these
federal
safety
standards
and
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
but
if
this
county
had
to
recognize
an
absence
of
immunity,
this
would
not
have
happened.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
your
honor
the
faa…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
my
answer
has
to
be
i
do
not
know,
i
can
answer
you
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
marshall.
after
this
sad
crash
and
after
these
deaths,
the
faa
brought
a
law
suit
to
close
it
down
and…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
close
the
garbage
dump
down
and
having
up,
i
am
afraid
to
go
beyond
the
record
but
my
impression
is
that
that
was
vigorously
defended
and
ultimately
compromised,
also
if
i
may
continue
outside
the
record
i
think
the…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
the
federal
approval
for
say,
was
never
withdrawn,
there
were
threats
from…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
that
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
well,
we
have
sued
the
united
states
your
honor
and
we
do
feel
that
there
was
our
responsibility.
i
want
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
spectrum
here
of
a
reasonable
possible
result
with
area
applied
state
law
of
the
georgia
third-party
beneficiary
exception
to
its
general
immunity
doctrine
being
at
one
end
of
a
reasonable
spectrum
and
the
implication
of
a
federal
remedy,
under
cort
versus
ash
at
the
other
end
of
a
reasonable
spectrum
and
while
adopting
both
of
those
arguments,
i
think
it
might
be
more
useful
if
i
would
develop
myself
primarily
to
the
application
of
federal
common
law
to
some
or
all
of
these
issues.
the
irony
of
the
case
is
the
majority
of
the
panel
decision
below,
took
the
case
as
an
erie
case
construed
properly,
georgia
law
to
find
this
narrow
contract
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
county
immunity
and
granted
us
standing.
judge
dyer
(ph)
who
dissented
from
that
said
“no,
this
is
a
case
where
serious
federal
interests
are
involved.
this
is
the
united
states
as
a
part
of
the
contract,
united
states
is
a
defendant
in
the
lawsuit.
this
is
aviation
which
is
federally
preempted,
so
we
have
got
to
trial
those
case
on
the
federal
common
law.
then
he
went
on
and
found
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
the
old
restatement
of
contract
through
145
from
1932
would
give
us
the
less
liberal
and
a
result
that
we
kept
--
a
standard
we
can
not
meet
as
third-party
beneficiaries.
he
ignored
the
recent
cases
including
the
bossier
parish
case
which
you
mr.
chief
justice
set
on
the
panel
of
with
the
fifth
circuit
ten
or
so
years
ago
where
you
held
that
children
had
a
standing
to
assert
rights
as
third-party
beneficiaries
under
an
agreement
an
agreement
between
a
county
and
the
united
states
with
respect
to
access
to
schools
that
was
certainly
a
federal
common
law
decision.
the
city
of
englewood
case
from
the
ninth
circuit
is
an
airport
grant
agreement
case
which
held
that
only
the
city
of
englewood,
but
individual
citizens
there
as
the
class
could
sue
as
third-party
beneficiaries
to
enforce
the
aviation
grant
agreements.
so,
we
assert
that
very
clearly
federal
common
law
is
at
least
as
liberal
on
the
third-party
beneficiary
issue
as
this
georgia
law
and
i
think
this
is
ought
to
be
put
to
rest
by
the
fact
that
just
about
ten
years
ago,
the
restatement
draftsmen
offered
a
new
section
145
which
brings
doctrinal
third-party
beneficiary
concepts
in
line
with
reality
and
so
that
we
know
there
is
no
significance
difference
between
the
rights
of
third-party
beneficiaries
with
respect
to
contract
which
government
is
a
party
and
with
private.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
in
construction
of
george
law,
if
this
court
should
deem
that
this
is
a
area
case,
i
would
assert
that
the
panel’s
majority
decision
ought
to
control,
that’s
the
correct
interpretation…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
any
judge
in
the
court
below
took
that
decision.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
then
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
overpowering
urgency
for
the
court
and
not
to
consider
this
a
mere
area
case
because
i
think
that
would…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
if
federal
law
governs
this
case,
you
can
interpret
the
contract
to
which
the
united
states
was
a
party
and
which
involves
the
federally
preempted
area
of
commerce,
you
can
construe
it
by
federal
common
law
rules…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
that
is
not
a
constitutional
issue.
there
was
some
phrase
there
at
the
state
and
there
was
some
phrase
with
sovereign
immunity.
we
do
not
have
that.
this
is
lincoln
county
v.
luning
from
this
court
in
1896
or
1898.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
this
is
not
a
11th
amendment
case.
this
is
not
in
state
of
georgia,
it
is
a
county
and
the
only
immunity
is
the
immunity
asserted
by
a
georgia
statute.
now,
our
opponents
talk
about
this
was
constitutionalized
in
georgia’s
constitution.
that
was
after
the
bill
and
is
of
no
relevance.
this
case
we
have
here
merely
a
georgia
statute
which
says
that
a
county
will
be
immune
from
tort
and
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
require
this
court
in
a
federal
question
case.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
as
your
honor
suggesting
full
question,
credit
or…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
i
think
if
this
was
an
erie
case
certainly
so,
but
there
is
a
whole
lot
of
cases
starting
with
pardon
from
alabama
which
holds
that
even
the
state
itself,
which
on
the
face
of
it
has
the
11th
amendment
protection
waive
the
immunity
when
it
enters
a
federal
sphere
of
commerce
and
it
is
my
contention
that…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
pardon
in
that
line
of
case
as
mr.
chief
justice
were
implied
waive
first
not…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
that
is
exactly
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
there
are
many
cases,
the
recent
seventh
circuit
case
kohr
involving
an
air
crash
found
that
federal
common
law
ought
to
control
with
respect
to
the
various
substantive
issues.
they
are
the
issues
were
contribution
and
indemnity,
that
they
did
not
even
have
a
contract
as
we
do
here.
so
i
would
say
that
a
fortiori
here
where
we
are
interpreting
a
federal
contract
in
the
rights
of
parties
under
that
federal
contract,
that
federal
common
law
opt
to.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
yes,
your
honor...
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
they
are
defended,
the
united
states
is
defended
in
this
action
and
the…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
yes
sir.
the
united
states
also
may
cross
claims
against
a
case.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
we
resided
compliance
was
the
conditions
preceding
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
then
resided
the
appropriate
section
of
title
28
with
respect
there
too
and
i
think
generally,
being
incorporated
all
of
our
allegations.
the
original
complaint
was
lengthy
and
very
shortly
after
complaint
was
filed
a
very
lengthy
amendment
was
filed
which
is
in
the
right…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
that
is
our
complaint,
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
yeah,
this
your
honor,
i
might
say,
just
by
way
of
an
aside
that
the
question
came
up
just
during
briefing
as
to
whether
the
united
states
has
been
dismissed
from
the
action
and
the
i
would
not
elaborate
here,
but
i
think
it
is
very
clear
and
i
did
in
my
reply
brief
i
think
adequately
support
the
contention
that
the
claims
of
united
states
was
still
alive.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
the
united
states
is
determined
early
on
in
this
litigation
that
its
interest
would
not
be
affected
here
by
because
it
is
the
motion
to
dismiss
had
never
been
--
the
county’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
united
states’
have
cross
claims
had
never
been
ruled
upon,
i
understand
that
that
is
still
the
united
states.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
united
states
was
simply
relying
upon
the
fact
that
it
is
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
its
cross
claims
was
not
granted
and
that
is
a
matter
of
clear
law.
the
united
states
filed
a
memorandum
and
i
think
that
is
some
reference
to
those
cases
are
in
my
reply
brief
and
i
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
county
can
not
assert
sovereign
immunity
or
governmental
immunity
vis-a-vis
the
united
states.
so,
well
there
maybe
perhaps
some
confusion
in
the
record,
i
think
the
united
states
is
under
no
fear
that
its
claims
there
have
been
jeopardized.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
well
that
issue
is
not
forced
today.
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
united
states
filed
against
our
claims
and
not
before
your
honor
today.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
it
is
one
last
suit,
but
the
only
thing
that
is
before
you
today
is
the
county’s
motion
to
dismiss
the
various
petitioners’
original
complaints.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
is
something
that
has
not
come
up
and
i
am
not
sure
i
can
answer
that
adequately,
but
of
the
top
of
my
head
i
do
not
see
why,
we
have
an
adequate
remedy
against
the
united
states
on
the
tort
claims
act
here.
the
fault
of
the
united
states
would
be
with
respect
of
operation
of
the
power
and
the
failure
to
report
to
this
power
that
there
had
been
bird
sliding.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
it
could.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
your
honor
the
claims
against
the
united
states
are
still
pending,
the
claims
of
the
petitioners
against
dekalb
county
went
up
under
1292
(b)
and
on
that
i
certify
interlocutory
matter.
i
would
like
to
close
by
bringing
back
my
emphasis
to
the
middle
of
this
spectrum
away
from
an
implied
federal
remedy
on
the
one
hand
and
away
from
the
contract
concept
on
the
other
hand
into
the
notion
that
the
court
can
resolve
this
matter
by
applying
proper
principles
of
federal
common
law
here.
both
proper
principle
of
federal
common
law
with
respect
to
the
rights
of
third-party
beneficiaries
and
also
a
principle
that
federal
common
law
will
not
embrace
archaic
doctrine
of
immunity
for
a
party
which
contracts
with
the
united
states
in
a
preempted
area
of
commerce
specifically
aviation
where
the
whole
thrust
of
the
statutory
scheme
and
the
whole
thrust
of
the
contract
is
safety.
if
you
read
this
record,
you
will
see
that
it
is
not
a
philosophical
statement
to
say
that
immunity
caused
this
air
crash.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up,
thank
you.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
in
pardon
on
the
one
hand,
you
have
the
state
itself
deemed
to
have
waived
its
immunity
by
entering
the
area,
our
case
is
a
fortiori.
on
the
other
hand,
that
was
an
fela
question
in
pardon
and
i
think
that
that
phase
of
the
case
was
easier
than
the…
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
i
do
not
recall
that
it
went
on
a
proprietary
governmental
distinction
in
any
of
it's,
the
operation
of
the
airport.
mr.
alan
w.
heldman
i
believe
he
wrote
that
opinion
mr.
justice
brennan,
thanks.
