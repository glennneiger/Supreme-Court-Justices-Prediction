unknown
speaker
perhaps
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
that
it
was
illegal
for
a
pharmacist
to
sell
contraceptives
to
those
under
16.
unknown
speaker
pharmacists
may
not.
unknown
speaker
unless
prescribed
by
a
physician
--
unknown
speaker
pharmacists
may
not
sell
to
those
under
16
period.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
say
that,
that
license
--
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
how
available
they
are
to
people
under
16
who
go
to
clinics
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
and
you
did
not
offer
any
evidence
to
show
that
they
were
in
fact
available
through
the
doctors
or
clinics.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
said
they
are
available,
by
that
you
mean
there
is
no
statutory
objection?
unknown
speaker
maybe
doctors
don't
have
a
stock
of
contraceptives
in
their
office
or
their
clinics.
how
do
we
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
wanted
to
prove
that
they
are
available,
why
would
you
object
to
the
summary
judgment.
you
could
have
put
an
evidence
--
unknown
speaker
you
are
making
the
argument
that
they
are
available,
and
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
make
that
argument,
you
should
be
pointing
to
something
in
the
record
to
show
they
are.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
silverman,
the
only
statute
that
is
here
is
the
one
quoted
on
page
2
of
your
brief,
new
york
state
education
law,
section
6811
(8).
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
say
anything
about
physicians.
unknown
speaker
is
that
quoted
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
can
you
paraphrase
the
phrase
what
it
provides?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
distribution
must
be
directly
by
the
physician.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
silverman
would
it
violate
the
statute
for
a
parent
to
give
his
child
a
contraceptive?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
silverman,
let
me
follow
through
on
your
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
are
there
other
non
prescription
products
the
sale
of
which
under
new
york
statute
is
restricted
to
licensed
pharmacist?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
non
prescription
products
--
my
question
is
whether
you
know
of
any
other
such
product,
the
sale
of
which
is
restricted
to
licensed
pharmacists
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
do
you
justify
this
on
the
ground
that
a
licensed
pharmacist
has
some
particular
expertise
in
the
dispensation
of
these
products?
unknown
speaker
now,
this
is
not
anti-trust
case
anyway?
unknown
speaker
what
age
can
then
--
people
get
married
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
14
for
the
girl?
unknown
speaker
does
new
york
prohibit
they
have
a
statutory
rate
provision?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
age
of
concern?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
married
couple
--
unknown
speaker
the
wife
--
14
or
15
could
not
--
unknown
speaker
buy
any
of
these
things
except
from
a
physician.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
other
products
that
maybe
legally
sold
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
new
york
--
says
may
not
be
displayed
or
advertised?
unknown
speaker
under
new
york
law?
unknown
speaker
in
your
discussion
of
the
consideration
rather
than
the
standing
of
this
organization
commercially
to
raise
the
equal
protection
claim.
have
you
considered
our
opinion
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
in
boren
and
craig?
unknown
speaker
assume
there
are.
unknown
speaker
but,
in
boren
and
craig,
we
ended
up
with
a
commercialized
proceeding,
did
we
not?
unknown
speaker
that
she
had
standing
to
the
equal
protection
claim
of
males
18-21
who
want
to
buy
beer.
unknown
speaker
how
you
differ
this
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
speaking
--
i
am
addressing
the
equal
protection
claim
--
we
have
an
equal
protection
claim
asserted
by
the
same
commercial
dispenser
--
do
we
not?
unknown
speaker
certainly
the
standing
of
argument
would
not
depend
on
whether
it
is
equal
protection
of
privacy,
would
not
you
get
the
same
answers?
unknown
speaker
didn't
eisenstadt
permit
a
commercial
dispenser
to
raise
the
equal
protection
--
that
was
equal
protection
too,
was
not
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
also
contraceptives.
unknown
speaker
well,
definitely
we
permitted
someone
in
the
business
of
making
a
profit
to
assert
the
third
party
claims
in
the
craig
and
boren.
unknown
speaker
we
did
also
i
think
in
eisenstadt.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
that
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
we
did
what?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
controlled
our
decision?
unknown
speaker
initially
there
was
a
plaintiff
in
craig
--
initially
who
was
under
21
year
old
male.
unknown
speaker
no
such
person
has
ever
been
identified
in
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
he
is
42
years
old.
unknown
speaker
well,
whether
or
not
he
exists,
he
is
42
years
old.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
ask
at
the
very
moment?
unknown
speaker
but
mrs.
silverman,
in
your
questions
presented,
you
didn’t
raise
any
question
about
the
summary
judgment
procedure,
did
you?
in
your
jurisdictional
statement.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
limit
it’s
a
non
medical
products?
unknown
speaker
but
what
you
said
there,
there
was
right
to
obtain
non
medical
products.
is
that
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
how
possibly
was
that
a
permissible
issue
in
a
federal
district
court
which
was
properly
concerned
only
with
the
constitutionality
of
this
law?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
decision
was
that,
it
constitutionally
harmed
them,
that
it
invaded
and
violated
some
rights
or
freedoms
of
theirs
protected
or
guaranteed
by
the
constitution,
that
was
one
thing
but
finding
that
the
law
was
a
bad
law
that
did
more
harm
than
good
was
no
business
of
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
mr.
pollet,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
rely
on?
unknown
speaker
do
you
means
just
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
gross
or
you
have
some
provision
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
which
one?
they
are
all
restrictions
on
state
action.
unknown
speaker
which
ones,
its
a
due
process
clause
or
equal
protection,
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
apply
in
privacy
in
those
provisions.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
court
has
tied
it
to
the
due
process
clause?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
find
it?
unknown
speaker
you
find
it
where
the
court
finds
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
shouldn't
be
permitted
to
find
it
anywhere
else.
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words,
it
has
to
be
the
chief
justice's
question.
your
submission
would
be
that
is
not
constitutionally
permissible
for
new
york
to
discourage
teenagers
to
get
married
but
it
is
unconstitutional
for
new
york
to
discourage
teenagers
to
have
sexual
intercourse
without
getting
married,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
answer
this
question,
and
so
the
issue
were
before
you?
unknown
speaker
well
i
thought
your
brief
anyways
said
there
was
no
connection
between
sexual
activity
and
receipt
of
contraceptives
anyway.
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
you
just
asserted
them
a
right
to
obtain
contraceptives.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that's
what
is
at
issue
here,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
of
new
york
still
have
a
statute
that
makes
fornication
a
misdemeanor?
unknown
speaker
did
they
ever
have
one?
unknown
speaker
just
with
respect
to
the
issues
that
are
before
us,
do
you
contend
that
a
15-year-old
has
a
constitutional
rights
to
put
these
products
to
their
intended
use.
unknown
speaker
and
the
state's
ban
is
unconstitutional
under
what
you
just
said.
unknown
speaker
because
the
minor
has
the
constitutional
right
to
do
this
free
of
any
state
restriction
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
is
your
answer
the
same
with
that
regard
to
the
age
of
the
minor?
suppose
the
statute
said
14
than
rather
than
16.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
difference
in
craig
against
boren.
we
knew
that
at
least
with
one
person
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
who
complained
about
the
law
has
affected
him,
i.e.
a
young
man
between
18
and
21.
in
this
litigation,
nobody
has
been
identified
whose
constitutional
rights
are
directly
affected,
and
who
is
being
represented
by
these
third
party
vendors.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
indeed
in
statute
in
craig
against
boren
if
i
am
not
mistaken
operated
against
the
vendor.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
the
rights
of
the
young
man
that
were
involved
and
decided
in
the
case,
in
craig
against
boren.
unknown
speaker
presumably,
at
least
there
was
evidence
and
there
was
such
a
person.
here
as
the
counsel
for
the
state
says
there
is
no
such
person
has
been
identified.
unknown
speaker
john
dove(ph)42
years
old.
unknown
speaker
he
just
said,
he
was
sexually
active.
he
didn't
say
anything
about
the
children
in
complaint.
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
a
john
dove
minor
here
or
mary
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
none
of
them
were
represented
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
two
other
plaintiffs,
main
plaintiff's
corporation
is
based
in
north
carolina.
one
is
described
as
a
non-profit
corporation
and
the
other
one
is
profit
corporation?
unknown
speaker
to
what
extend
are
the
two
affiliated?
unknown
speaker
the
names
are
quite
similar.
to
what
extend
do
the
boards
overlap?
unknown
speaker
which
one
do
you
represent?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
how
did
you
assemble
this
rather
extraordinary
group
of
plaintiffs?
fiscal
minista
(ph)
profit
corporation,
non-profit
corporation,various
doctors,
40/43
years
old
john
doe,
sexually
active
but
with
three
children?
how
did
you
get
them
all
together?
unknown
speaker
your
client
assembled
them?
unknown
speaker
all
i
said
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
pro
tanto,
it
said
was.
that
was
my
brother
rehnquist's
point.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
applies
to
the
pharmacist
not
the
pharmacies.
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
do
the
figures
indicate
whether
the
number
of
pharmacists
also
is
shrinking
in
new
york
state.
unknown
speaker
may
be
at
fewer
locations
but
there
may
be
more
of
them
available
--
unknown
speaker
may
i
try
and
understand
your
theory
a
little
better.
is
it
your
view
that
it
is
wholly
impermissible
for
the
state
to
assert
as
an
interest
or
justification
for
a
statute
of
this
kind.
--
will
discourage
in
sexual
activity
among
minor
children?
unknown
speaker
it's
fully
impermissible.
even
if
that's
your
view
then
you
really
need
any
of
these
legislative
facets.
because
that's
the
purpose
and
the
state
relies
on
–
do
you
say
it's
per
se
bad.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
a
showing
that
the
legislature
thought
was
sufficient,
but
you
say,
we
should
disagree
with
the
legislative
finding
on
that.
unknown
speaker
you
have
alternative
positions.
one
is
it's
wholly
impermissible
to
rely
on
this
discouraging
sexual
activity
as
justification.
secondly,
that
at
most
that's
really
merely
a
rational
basis
and
not
a
compelling
basis.
those
are
your
two
arguments.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
if
we
adopt
your
rationale
as
you
have
just
expressed
it,
wouldn't
we
invalidate
every
statutory
writ
of
statue
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
the
punishment
for
a
rape
is
not
inconsequential,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
but
i
am
just
thinking
about
how
far
your
rationale
would
reach
namely
that
there
could
be
no
valid
regulation
of
sexual
activity
regardless
of
age.
