ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
appellants
appeal
from
an
order
of
a
three
judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
which
enjoined
the
operation
of
section
6811
(8)
of
the
new
york
state
education
law.
this
law
did
three
things
and
we
are
talking
here
only
in
the
context
of
non-prescription
contraceptives
as
opposed
to
prescription
contraceptives.
the
first
thing
this
law
did
was
to
limit
the
sale
of
contraceptives
by
licensed
pharmacists
only
in
the
context
of
those
16
years
and
older.
it
also
forbade
the
sale
by
pharmacists
to
children
under
16
and
the
statutory
scheme
provides
that
these
particular
individuals
have
to
attain
their
non-prescription
contraceptives
from
a
physician.
this
is
provided
by
section
6807
1(b)
of
the
education
law.
finally,
the
statutory
scheme
prescribed
the
advertisement
and
display
of
contraceptive
products.
before
turning
to
the
merits
of
appellees'
claims,
i
would
just
like
briefly
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
standing
of
the
different
appellees
to
maintain
this
lawsuit.
the
district
court
held
that
population
planning
associates
and
hagen
had
standing
to
raise
the
first
amendment
and
privacy
rights
of
users
of
non-prescription
contraceptives,
we
disagree.
as
per
plaintiff,
population
planning
associates
as
well
as
hagen,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
realistic
--
or
that
they
have
demonstrated
no
realistic
fear
of
prosecution
under
the
statute
that
is
currently
being
attacked.
as
we
have
pointed
out,
there
have
been
no
prosecutions
under
the
statute
of
new
york
state
since
1965.
we
feel
that
this
is
even
recognized
by
population
planning
associates
itself
since
--
although
they
received
two
letters
from
the
state
board
of
pharmacy
with
regards
to
the
advertisement
of
contraceptives.
they
waited
over
a
year
before
even
initiating
this
lawsuit
in
the
district
court.
although,
there
was
a
visit
to
their
premises
in
september,
1974
after
this
lawsuit
was
started.
this
visit
was
for
information
gathering
purposes
only,
and
is
not
sufficient
to
confer
standing
on
population
planning
associates.
as
for
the
reverent
hagen,
there
is
not
even
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
he
received
a
letter,
and
we
would
say
that
he
also
is
without
standing
and
without
standing
even
less
than
population
planning
associates
to
maintain
this
lawsuit.
even
if
appellees
had
demonstrated
a
realistic
fear
of
injury
under
the
statute,
we
also
feel
they
are
not
suitable
representatives
to
raise
the
privacy
rights
of
third
parties
which
is
what
they
are
both
attempting
to
do
in
this
lawsuit.
a
plaintiff
population
associates
is
a
commercial
firm
and
under
these
circumstances,
we
feel
they
are
not
a
proper
party
to
raise
the
privacy
rights
of
users
of
non-prescription
contraceptives
where
there
is
no
party
to
a
lawsuit
and
never
was
a
party
to
the
lawsuit
who
maintained
that
they
wanted
these
particular
products
sold
in
places
other
than
licensed
pharmacies.
with
respect,
plaintiff
population
planning
associates
raising
the
first
amendment
rights
of
others,
we
also
feel
they're
an
improper
party.
the
district
court
in
holding
that
they
had
standing
to
raise
the
first
amendment
rights
of
others,
relied
on
the
procunier
and
the
new
york
times
cases.
we
feel
that
neither
of
these
cases
support
that
position.
procunier
was
not
an
assertion
of
third
party
rights
case.
the
court
in
that
case
was
careful
to
state
that
we
do
not
deal
here
with
the
difficult
questions
of
the
so
called
right
to
hear
and
third
party
standing.
but
with
the
particular
means
of
communication
which
the
interest
of
both
parties
are
inextricably
mashed,
that's
in
procunier
at
page
409.
as
for
the
new
york
times
case,
we
would
submit
that
those
are
very
special
kinds
of
standing
cases
because
in
that
type
of
case,
a
third
party
is
not
permitted
to
raise
the
rights
of
those
who
would
receive
the
communication.
the
receivers
of
the
communication
not
knowing
about
the
communication
would
of
course
be
in
no
position
to
bring
the
lawsuit
themselves.
that
is
quite
different
from
the
case
here
where
there
is
a
statute
on
the
book,
and
those
who
would
benefit
from
appellees
argument
in
this
court,
would
be
in
a
position
to
attack
the
statute.
as
for
hagen,
he
does
not
allege
any
interference
with
his
receipt
of
information
regarding
contraceptives,
nor
does
he
allege
that
he
wishes
to
advertise
or
display
contraceptives
and
for
these
reasons,
we
would
also
feel
he
is
not
an
appropriate
party
to
raise
the
third
party
interest
--
to
raise
third
party
interest.
there
were
other
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
did
not
reach
the
question
of
their
standing.
we
would
submit
that
they
in
any
event
do
not
have
any
standing.
the
doctors
as
we
have
pointed
out
are
exempted
from
the
operation
of
section
6811
(a)
by
another
provision
of
the
education
law,
psilh,
no
threat
of
prosecution,
and
as
the
district
court
pointed
out,
their
exact
relationship
to
the
new
york
state
law
was
not
at
all
clear.
as
for
john
doe(ph),
he
was
never
identified
and
we
would
submit
that
an
analysis
of
the
complaint
would
indicate
that
his
claims
in
any
event
are
speculative.
turning
out
to
an
analysis
of
the
merits
of
the
claims
advanced
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
analyzed
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
from
a
right
of
privacy
standpoint.
they
held
that
the
right
of
private
â€“
that
access
to
contraceptive
products
was,
if
not
an
aspect
of
the
right
of
privacy
was
close
enough
for
them
to
consider
it
as
such.
and
they
therefore
found
that
the
state
could
not
regulate
in
this
area
unless
there
was
a
fundamental
reason
for
it
to
do
so.
it
is
our
position
however
that
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
district
court
applied
an
inappropriate
standard
to
the
new
york
state
statutory
scheme.
there
is
no
right
of
access
to
contraceptive
products
even
assuming
there
is
a
right
to
use
contraceptive
products
which
was
the
case
in
griswold
v.
connecticut.
new
york
in
providing,
that
only
licensed
pharmacist
or
physicians
where
children
under
16
are
concerned
may
distribute
contraceptives
has
merely
regulated
the
sources
from
which
individuals
may
obtain
contraceptives.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
i
thought
--
and
i
just
said
that,
new
york
in
providing
that
licensed
pharmacists
or
physicians
where
children
under
16
are
concerned,
that
is
true,
may
only
sell
contraceptive
--
only
physicians
may
distribute
contraceptives.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
that
is
correct.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
not
prescribed,
unless
obtained
from
a
physician,
we
are
talking
about
non-prescription
contraceptives.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
exactly.
they
would
have
to
obtain
non-prescription
contraceptives
from
a
clinic
where
a
physician
is
employed
or
works
or
from
a
physician
directly.
however,
there
are
no
individuals
in
new
york
state
that
are
denied
outright
the
ability
to
obtain
non-prescription
contraceptive
products.
thus,
the
statutory
scheme
under
attack
here
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
because
under
the
new
york
state
statutory
scheme,
adults
could
go
into
a
pharmacist
and
from
him,
they
could
purchase
non-prescription
contraceptives
and
a
child
under
the
age
of
16
could
go
to
a
clinic
or
to
a
physician
and
would
be
able
to
obtain
non-prescription
contraceptives.
so
there
was
no
category
of
individuals
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
does
not
have
some
means
of
obtaining
non-prescription
contraceptives.
and
for
this
reason
your
honor
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
no,
it
doesn't
your
honor.
this
was
decided
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
this
was
not
at
all
--
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
really
which
would
indicate
one
way
or
the
other.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well
your
honor,
we
said
that
they
were
available
through
doctors,
i
would
say
the
plaintiffs
offered
no
evidence
to
show
that
this
was
not
realistic
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
exactly.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well
your
honor,
we
don't
know
and
that
was
one
of
our
objections
to
the
granting
of
summary
judgment
by
the
district
court.
it
seemed
to
us
that
since
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well
your
honor,
we
did
object
summary
judgment,
but
it
seem
to
me
that
the
plaintiffs
were
the
ones
maintaining
this
lawsuit,
and
therefore
the
burden
was
on
them
in
attacking
the
state
statute
to
establish,
not
on
the
defendants,
that
they
were
unavailable,
and
therefore,
not
having
done
so,
we
feel
that
the
district
court
improperly
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
matter.
in
other
words,
i
do
not
see
the
burden
on
state.
to
me,
the
burden
was
on
the
plaintiffs
to
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
your
honor,
we
had
no
opportunity
if
we
were
permitted
to
go
to
trial
on
this
case,
we
would
have
been
able
or
would
have
at
that
time
proved
what
the
actual
practice
was
under
new
york
law.
however,
we
were
not
given
that
opportunity.
we
opposed
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
summary
judgment
was
granted.
we
feel
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
warrant
a
holding
by
the
district
court
that
they
were
unavailable,
since
there
are
clinics
maintained
by
one
of
the
amicus
in
these
courts,
and
i
understand
that
they
do
employ
physicians
and
therefore
a
children
could
go
to
these
clinics
as
well
as
their
own
physicians,
and
obtain
a
non-prescription
contraceptive
products.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yes
sir.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
your
honor,
there
is
another
provision
of
the
education
law
which
we
cited
in
that
same
article.
it
is
68
--
let
me
just
get
the
right
side,
section
6807
(1)
(b),
6807(1)
(b)
of
the
education
law.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
i
do
not
believe
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
is
i
believe
in
the
jurisdictional
state.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yeah.
it
says
that
nothing
in
this
article
shall
prohibit
a
physician
from
distributing
any
instruments
or
anything
that
he
feels
is
appropriate
in
the
course
of
his
practice.
that
is
an
instrument
and
whatever
other
words
are
used
--
identifying
another
section
of
education
law
as
items
that
would
obviously
include
non-prescription
contraceptives
and
i
might
say
that
the
state
board
of
pharmacy
has
always
interpreted
section
6811
(8)
to
exempt
physician
from
its
operations.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
that
is
true
your
honor.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
it
would
violate
the
terms
of
the
statute,
the
same
that
is
probably
as
much
as
a
parent
should
not
give
any
sort
of
a
drug
that
is
obtainable
by
a
prescription
to
a
minor.
how?
i
do
not
know,
if
that
is
a
realistic
kind
of
a
thing
to
consider
because
i
suppose
how
is
anybody
going
to
know
this
type
of
thing,
and
i
do
not
know
if
that
type
of
a
distribution
is
meaningful
under
the
statute,
but
i
think
by
its
terms,
it
probably
would.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yes,
i
would
agree
your
honor.
in
any
event,
since
as
we
have
just
been
discussing,
since
contraceptives
are
available
to
all
in
the
state
of
new
york,
we
would
say
that
the
claims
raised
here
by
the
appellees
do
not
reach
the
level
of
governmental
intrusion
into
matter,
so
affecting
the
decision
whether
to
bear
--
to
get
a
child,
and
therefore,
we
would
say
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
one
involving
the
right
to
use
contraceptive
products,
but
is
merely
a
state
statute
which
tends
to
regulate
the
sale
of
contraceptive
products,
and
does
not
establish
any
independent
constitutional
right.
i
believe
that
this
was
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
griswold
v.
connecticut
where
this
court
held
that
the
statutory
scheme,
an
issue
in
that
case
was
violative
of
the
constitution
because
it
forbade
the
use
of
contraceptives.
the
court
specifically
noted
at
page
485
that
the
statutory
scheme
did
not
simply
regulate
manufacture
or
sell,
which
is
the
case
with
this
particular
statute
of
course.
in
short,
then
we
would
simply
state
that
the
right
of
the
access
to
contraceptive
products
is
not
a
right
within
the
right
of
privacy,
is
not
a
right
within
the
constitution,
and
therefore,
the
district
court
in
invalidating
the
statutory
scheme
implied
an
inappropriate
and
unwarranted
constitutional
standard.
we
would
point
out
however,
that
even
if
they
were
right
in
applying
this
particular
standard,
that
the
reasons
for
the
statutory
scheme
are
such
that
the
regulation
is
permissible.
i
would
just
at
this
point
though
like
to
note
with
respect
to
the
claim
that
only
licensed
pharmacists
may
distribute
non-prescription
contraceptives
that
we
feel
that
this
is
an
argument
that
cannot
really
be
taken
seriously
by
this
court,
since
there
are
many
pharmacies
in
new
york
and
it
does
not
seem
to
the
appellants
that
this
really
raises
a
realistic
claim.
there
is
no
proof
in
the
record,
and
we
do
not
believe
it
could
seriously
be
shown
by
the
appellees
that
an
individual
in
new
york
state
could
not
obtain
non
prescription
contraceptives
if
they
did
not
want
to.
there
are
many,
many
pharmacies
in
new
york
and
to
us,
it
seems
a
highly
specious
argument
to
claim
that
there
was
not
a
supply
of
these
contraceptives
or
that
they
are
unavailable
to
particular
individuals
wishing
to
purchase
them.
in
any
event
we
would
submit
further
that
the
limitations
on
sale
which
permit
only
licensed
pharmacists
to
sell
non
prescription
contraceptives
is
eminently
reasonable.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
that
is
true
your
honor,
and
also
i
believe
under
federal
regulation.
we
would
say
that
the
reasons
for
the
statute
are
among
the
following
that
by
permitting
only
licensed
pharmacists
to
sell
non
prescription
contraceptives;
this
assures
that
only
persons
of
mature
years
will
be
involved
in
the
sale
of
such
products.
it
also
permits
an
area
of
expertise
in
the
types
of
products
to
be
developed
which
permits
purchasers
to
inquire
as
to
the
relative
qualities
of
the
different
products.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
non
prescription?
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
at
the
moment
your
honor,
i
cannot
think
of
any.
that
is
not
to
say
there
are
not
any.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
complete
range
of
--
but
i
would
think
that
if
one
needs
a
prescription,
then
one
would
have
to
obtain
it
from
a
licensed
pharmacist.
i
can
imagine
if
it
were
--
the
prescription
item
that
would
by
definition
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
i
do
not
know
of
any
your
honor,
as
i
say
that
does
not
mean
there
are
not
any,
but
i
at
the
moment
do
not
know
of
any,
no.
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
one
of
the
items
though
that
does
fall
in
that
category.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
we
justify
it
on
various
grounds
your
honor,
one
of
them
is
that
permitting
a
licensed
pharmacist
to
sell
these
products
does
permit
an
area
of
expertise
to
be
developed
at
least
whereby
he
would
have
some
idea
of
what
particular
product
might
be
best
suited
for
some
particular
individual.
and
with
his
training,
would
be
a
in
better
position
than
the
average
individual
to
answer
any
questions.
since
presumably
a
pharmacist
would
have
been
to
a
specialized
school
and
would
have
a
background
in
chemicals
etcetera.
we
feel
there
are
other
justifications
however
by
limiting
the
sale
by
licensed
pharmacist,
this
prohibits
anyone
or
prevents
rather
anyone
from
tampering
with
the
items
and
also,
if
the
statutory
scheme
which
forbids
display
of
contraceptives
and
limits
the
sale
by
minors
to
physicians
only,
since
the
state
board
of
pharmacy
employees
investigators,
these
provisions
are
capable
of
realistic
enforcement
if
contraceptives
result
anywhere,
of
course
there
would
be
no
way
really
to
enforce
these
particular
provisions.
the
appellees
raise
an
argument
in
this
court
which
they
mentioned
briefly
in
their
complaint,
but
didnâ€™t
pursue
thereafter
and
i
took
it
as
abandoned
--
that
the
fact
that
these
products
are
limited,
that
only
licensed
pharmacists
may
sell
these
products
keeps
the
prices
of
the
products
artificially
high.
we
would
submit
that
there
is
no
proof
in
the
record
of
that
particular
point,
but
even
if
there
were
that,
that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
a
reason
to
overturn
the
statutory
scheme.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
thatâ€™s
another
point
your
honor.
as
for
the
limitation
on
the
way,
minors
under
the
age
of
16
may
obtain
non
prescription
contraceptives,
we
would
also
submit
that
even
if
there
is
a
right
of
access
to
contraceptive
products,
that
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
is
again
constitutional
that
the
reason
the
legislature
has
advanced
for
this
particular
statutory
scheme
is
the
morality
of
the
youth
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
we
would
submit
that
the
morality
of
the
youth
of
the
state
of
new
york
wants
this
particular
legislation.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
various
studies
and
statical
analysis
which
we
feel
support
the
position
that
even
if
not
non
prescription
contraceptives
were
more
widely
available,
youngsters
13,
14,
12,
11
whatever
age
they
are
like
would
not
use
them.
however,
by
making
them
widely
available,
we
would
in
effect
be
sanctioning
sexual
activity
by
these
particular
groups
of
youngsters.
under
these
circumstances
we
feel
it
was
reasonable
for
the
state
legislature
to
determine
that
permitting
youngsters
to
obtain
these
products
from
a
physician
was
in
the
best
interest
of
these
youngsters
and
was
consistent
with
the
morality,
the
standards
of
morality
of
the
state.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
i
believe
16
and
14.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
i
believe
thatâ€™s
correct.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
i
believe
it
is
either
16
or
18,
i
am
not
absolutely
sure
--
17
excuse
me,
mr.
pollock(ph)
is
correcting
me.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
she
could
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
exactly
your
honor.
as
we
have
again
pointed
out
in
our
brief
just
to
go
a
little
further
with
this
point
that
family
planning
assumes
both
in
family
context
and
the
possibility
of
rational
planning
and
studies
with
respect
to
very
young
children
seem
to
point
out
that
youngsters
that
their
sex
is
often
episodic
and
unanticipated,
that
passion
tends
to
triumph
over
reason
and
that
therefore
even
assuming
that
these
products
were
available,
they
would
not
be
used.
my
discussion
up
to
this
point
has
been
in
the
context
of
the
right
of
privacy
which
is
really
the
advantage
point
from
which
the
district
court
analyzed
the
appellees
claims.
i
would
submit
though
that
even
from
a
standard
equal
protection
analysis,
that
the
constitutional
scheme
which
i
have
been
discussing
passes
constitutional
muster
assuming
there
were
proper
parties
to
this
lawsuit
to
raise
equal
protection
claims.
we
would
submit
that
for
the
same
reasons,
we
have
advanced
with
regard
to
the
right
of
privacy
that
again
the
equal
protection
standard
is
not
violated
by
the
statutory
scheme.
now,
the
final
part
of
the
district
court's
opinion
deals
with
the
statutory
prohibition
on
advertisement
and
display
of
contraceptive
products.
the
district
court
held
that
this
was
violative
of
the
first
amendment.
again,
we
disagree.
the
statutory
scheme
under
attack
here
applies
only
to
commercial
advertisements.
we
would
submit
that
even
if
commercial
advertisements
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment
that
the
state
may
regulate
nonetheless
a
commercial
advertisement
to
a
greater
extent
than
a
communication
which
merely
sets
forth
an
idea.
viewing
this
context,
we
would
state
that
it
was
proper
for
the
legislature
to
pass
this
particular
statute.
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
this
statute
was
motivated
by
the
belief
that
the
advertisement
and
display
of
contraceptive
products
would
again
lead
to
the
legitimization
of
sexual
activity
by
very
young
people
in
the
state
which
would
be
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
was
also
of
a
concern
by
the
legislature
that
the
sensibilities
of
adults
might
be
offended
if
the
advertisement
and
display
of
contraceptive
products
were
permitted.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
none
that
i
know
of
your
honor,
but
i
would
point
out
that
there
were
limitations
on
cigarettes
and
alcoholic
beverages,
and
those
of
course
may
legally
be
sold
in
the
state
and
there
are
limitations
of
course
on
the
way
for
those
particular
products.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
of
course
the
federal
law
and
i
do
not
know
if
new
york
has
the
identical
statute
or
a
regulation,
but
of
course
there
are
examples
of
other
governmental
regulation
of
products
that
are
legal,
but
on
the
other
hand
may
not
be
advertised.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yes,
i
have
your
honor.
i
have
right
here,
and
i
think
that,
that
case
is
somewhat
different
from
this
case
for
the
reason
that
there,
at
least
at
one
point,
there
was
a
male
who
was
between
the
ages
of
18
and
21
who
desired
to
purchase
the
beverages
under
consideration
in
that
case.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
that
you
have
the
sellers
or
the
vendors
of
these
products
raising
claims
for
people
who
are
not
parties,
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
wishes
to
have
these
products
advertised
or
wishes
them
sell
to
children
under
the
age
of
16.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
sense
in
this
particular
case
without
any
demonstration
ever
of
a
category
of
people
who
would
benefit
from
the
ruling
or
that
benefited
from
the
district
court's
ruling
that
this
case
is
quite
different
from
the
craig
case.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
if
there
are,
your
honor,
then
i
think
this
case
does
go
a
little
further
than
singleton
for
instance,
but
i
just
think
that,
that
is
a
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yes,
that
is
true.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
that
is
true
your
honor.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
first
of
all
they
have
the
equal
protection
claim,
here
you
have
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
i
think
we
do
your
honor.
i
am
not
quite
sure
the
plaintiffs
mentioned
it
tangentially
in
their
complaint
never
really
urged
it
thereafter
but
assuming
that
there
is,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
distinction
is
that
at
least
in
craig,
there
was
a
feeling
at
least
or
at
least
the
court
knew
that
there
was
at
least
somebody
who
at
some
point
in
time
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
i
think
that
would
depend
on
analysis
of
how
well
the
party
could
raise
the
particular
claim.
in
other
words,
if
there
was
no
difference
between
the
equal
protection,
the
position.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
that
was
an
equal
protection
claim.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yeah,
but
i
do
not
think
that
there
--
was
looking
really
to
sell
the
contraceptives.
i
viewed
him
more
as
a
genuine
advocate
and
some
with
an
interest
that
was
more
akin
to
those
that
would
benefit
or
at
least
that
they
alleged
would
benefit
from
the
ruling
must
hear,
you
have
somebody
really
just
looking
to
make
a
profit.
and
i
question
whether
someone
looking
to
make
a
profit
should
be
permitted
to
stand
in
the
same
position
as
those
who
they
claim
would
benefit.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
yes,
you
did
your
honor.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
as
i
said
and
i
think
eisenstadt
is
different.
i
donâ€™t
think
there
was
really
--
i
do
not
see
him
as
a
commercial
entity,
but
with
respect
to
craig,
i
would
say
that
the
difference
between
craig
and
this
case
is
one
that
the
standing
claim
was
never
really
raised
in
the
court
below
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
in
craig,
and
in
reading
craig,
i
have
a
sense
that
perhaps
that
when
some
have
to
the
court's
determination
as
to
whether
that
was
really
a
sincere
claim
raised
by
the
defendants
in
that
particular
case
but
again,
i
would
point
out
that
to
me
the
more
serious
problem.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
in
craig,
this
court
noted.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
you
note,
the
court
noted
that
initially
and
despite
having
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
appellees
never
raised
before
the
district
court
any
objection
to
witness
reliance
upon
the
claimed
unequal
treatment
to
18-20
year
old
males.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
no,
i
donâ€™t
your
honor;
i
merely
pointed
out
this
one
factor.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
exactly,
so
at
least
the
court
was
not
dealing
with
an
unrealistic
sort
of
a
claim.
here,
i
feel
that
there
is
--
at
this
juncture,
i
do
not
think
we
really
know
that
there
is
any
individual
in
the
state
of
new
york
who
is
particularly
anxious
to
have
non
prescription
contraceptives
advertised,
nor
do
i
know
if
there
are
any
youngsters
under
the
age
of
16
are
particularly
anxious
going
to
pharmacies.
i
mean,
the
point
is
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
which
would
warrant
that
particular
finding.
that
is
the
way
i
feel
craig.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
that
is
true,
other
than
john
doe(ph)
but
again
he
has
--
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
never
been
identified
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
john
doe(ph)
exists,
and
i
do
not
know
who
he
is.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
i
believe
he
has
two
children
your
honor.
in
any
event,
in
conclusion
then,
i
would
ask
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
granted
summary
judgment
to
the
plaintiffs
be
reversed
and
at
the
very
least
judgment,
be
entered
for
the
appellants.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
the
very
least
i
would
ask
that
the
judgment
be
reversed,
the
very
most
i
suppose,
but
the
very
least
i
would
asked
us
to
be
given
an
opportunity
or
at
least
the
plaintiff
should
be
required
to
prove
their
claims
and
we
should
have
a
proper
opportunity
to
refute
them.
what
the
district
court
did
i
think
was
just
take
a
bunch
of
citations
to
questionable
studies;
i
donâ€™t
know
who
did
the
studies
or
on
what
basis
they
did
the
studies,
it
reached
to
all
these
fabulous
conclusions.
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
problems
with
this
kind
of
case
that
courts
are
sitting
as
legislatures.
i
donâ€™t
think
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
is
appropriate
for
resolution
really
by
a
court
at
all.
but
at
least
if
the
court
is
going
to
undertake
the
test
than
i
think
that
the
defendant
should
be
given
a
proper
opportunity
to
hear
what
there
case
is
and
be
given
an
equal
opportunity.
ms.
arlene
r.
silverman
well,
if
i
didnâ€™t
in
absolute
terms
your
honor
i
thought
that
i
was
implied
in
my
reply
brief
as
well
as
throughout.
