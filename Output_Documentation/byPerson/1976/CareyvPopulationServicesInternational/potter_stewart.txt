well,
it
makes
it
--
the
statute
makes
it
illegal
for
anybody
to
give
or
sell
the
contraceptive
to
anybody
whether
it
be
parent
or
child
or
whatever
--unless
he
is
a
distributor,
seller
or
a
pharmacist
or
a
physician.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there
are
other
products
that
under
new
york
law
maybe
sold
only
by
licensed
pharmacists,
aren't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
constantino
that's
it's
constitutional
freedom
to
purchase
intoxicating
beverages.

against

justice

stewart
now
who
is
the
mother
and
who
is
the
child,
you
are
talking
about
the
teenager
as
the
child
or
the
mother?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
are
talking
in
that
context.
justice
potter
stewart
not
parent
and
teenager
who
wants
to
acquire
contraceptives.
justice
potter
stewart
or
you
are
talking
about
the
teenager
as
the
parent?
justice
potter
stewart
but
suppose
in
a
statutory
rape
case,
it's
only
the
man
in
the
absence
of
aid
or
abettor
who
can
be
prosecuted
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
anybody
under
16
would
not
be
prosecuted
for
statutory
rape
but
would
rather
be
dealt
within
juvenile
court,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
would
have
to
be
somebody
over
16
who
would
be
subject
to
this
criminal
sections
of
statutory
rape,
a
man
over
16.
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
his
claim
to
this
field
of
privacy
and
sexual
activity
be
even
stronger
than
someone
under
16
and
presumably
an
adult
has
a
stronger
claim
in
that
area
than
a
minor?
