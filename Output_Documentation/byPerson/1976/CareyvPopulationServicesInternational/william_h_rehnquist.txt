justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
three-judge
district
court
said
that
this
law
harmed
rather
than
helped
the
citizens
of
new
york.
is
that
the
kind
of
decision
that
three-judge
district
court
ordinarily
makes
in
a
constitutional
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
is
there
anything
wrong
with
the
statutory
rape
provision
n
constitutionally
in
your
view
that
presumably
prohibits
a
16
year
old
male
from
having
sexual
intercourse
with
a
15
year
old
female,
both
of
them
consent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
new
york
cannot
in
anyway
discourage
sexual
promiscuity
among
children
14,
15,
13
years
old
in
your
view.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
say
it
can't
do
it
by
making
it
a
criminal
offense
for
the
man
to
have
intercourse
with
a
woman
of
that
age.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
stanley
against
georgia,
the
court
held
that,
you
have
the
right
to
read
whatever
books
you
have
without
being
intruded
on
and
yet
in
the
miller
and
aredo
(ph)
cases,
a
year
or
two
later
they
held
that
you
didn't
have
any
right
to
obtain
those
materials.
so
at
least
those
two
cases
would
tend
to
cut
against
your
argument
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
use
them,
you
must
have
a
right
to
obtain
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
giving
a
privacy
case
here,
aren't
you?
