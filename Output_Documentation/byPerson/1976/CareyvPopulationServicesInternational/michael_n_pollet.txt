mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
blieve
it
requires
parental
consent.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
believe
that’s
accurate.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
it
is
the
appellees
view
and
it
was
the
conclusion
in
holding
of
the
three-judge
district
court
that
new
york’s
anti-contraceptive
law
conveys
an
established
personal
privacy
right,
namely
the
fundamental
right
of
individual
choice
and
freedom
from
state
interference
in
matters
of
family
planning
and
birth
control.
this
constitutional
privacy
right,
it
has
been
held
encompasses
not
only
the
abortion
decision
but
also
includes
the
right
to
obtain
non
medical
products
used
to
prevent
conception
and
right
to
convey
and
receive
information
about
such
products.
this
statute
which
impinges
upon
the
right
of
reproductive
freedom
is
as
judges
finley,
pierce
and
connor
of
the
three-judge
court
below
held
a
law
which
harms
rather
than
benefits
the
citizens
of
new
york
state.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
because
in
our
view
there
is
no
health
rationale
which
supports
the
state's
restriction
and
limitation
on
the
sale
of
non
medical
contraceptives.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no.
if
i
did,
i
misspoke
your
honor;
the
right
to
obtain
would
of
course
include
the
right
to
obtain
medical
as
well
as
non
medical
products.
we
make
no
contingent
here
that
the
imposition
of
requirements
of
prescriptions
for
drugs
and
compounds
which
require
such
restrictions
are
illegal,
this
case
is
limited
to
the
sale
and
distribution
of
non
medical
contraceptives.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
don’t
think
it
was
necessary
mr.
justice
rehnquist
for
the
court
to
make
that
finding
but
on
the
record
that
was
put
before
them
that
finding
was
well
justified.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
i
believe
the
constitutionality
requires
that
those
factors
be
brought
in
directly
if
not
peripherally.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well
i
think
the
federal
court
below
did
what
this
court
didn't
roe
v.
wade,
and
that
is
in
order
to
determine
the
fundamentality
of
the
right
asserted.
it
looked
if
the
harm
and
consequences
which
would
befall
the
citizens
if
that
activity
were
denied
to
them.
and
in
so
doing,
it
found
dire,
devastating,
and
tragic
consequences
which
would
result
from
the
limitations
and
denial
of
access
to
contraceptives.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
we
rely
primarily
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
right
of
privacy
derived
there
affirmed
from
the
fourteenth
amendments
concept
of
personal
liberty.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
the
restrictions
on
the
state
action
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
are
involved
on
different
levels
in
this
case.
we
also
rely
of
course
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
believe
that
those
rights
are
implicit
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
this
court
had
said
so.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
i
think
in
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
think
i
feel
the
same
way
the
court
does
in
roe
v.
wade
that
while
there's
a
slight
preference
for
fourteenth
amendment
that
has
also
been
held
by
this
court
in
griswold,
so
that
such
rights
also
derive
from
emanations
of
the
first,
third,
fourth
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
exactly.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
we
are
not
seeking
to
establish
new
law
or
breakthrough,
new
frontiers
on
this
case.
i
don't
believe
that
there's
a
valid
criticism
of
unstructured
substantive
due
process.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows
from
our
view.
our
view
is
based
upon
holdings
of
this
court,
holdings
of
this
court
in
griswold,
eisenstadt
v.
baird,
roe
v.
wade
and
those
lower
district
courts
which
have
interpreted
and
applied
those
three
decisions,
two
cases
involving
restrictions
upon
contraceptives.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
it's
just
that
the
first
issue
was
not
before
us
here.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
i
don't
believe
that
new
york
constitutionally
has
the
right
to
foster
a
moral
climate
or
to
regulate
morals
in
a
fashion
which
it
intends
to
do
in
this
statute.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
correct,
the
state
has
made
that
concession
throughout
all
the
proceedings
below
that
there
was
no
proof
and
there
nothing
has
been,
no
facts
have
been
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
there's
a
right
to
obtain
contraceptives.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
only
as
it
is
supported
by
proper
health
rationale,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
would
believe
that
if
a
regulation
is
necessary
to
achieve
a
compelling
state
interest
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
it
can't
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
we
can
not,
it
may
be
possible
that
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
do
say
that
the
state
can
regulate
it
if
it
can
demonstrate--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
there's
no
fornication
statute
in
new
york.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
believe
it
did
at
one
time.
it
was
repealed
several
years
ago.
there's
an
adultery
statute,
and
there's
also
a
statutory
rape
penal
for
this
act.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
would
in
my
view
be
unconstitutional,
that's
not
the
question
before
us
here.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
they
cannot
do
it,
as
it
is
done
here
by
potentially
punishing
them
with
the
threat
of
unwanted
birth
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
again,
that
is
not
the
question
before
us
but
it
is
my
view
and
that
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible.
that
would
also
be
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes,
we
do.
the
fundamental
privacy
right
of
access
to
contraceptives
is
even
more
important
for
minors
than
it
is
for
adults.
minors
have
been
shown
in
substantial
and
significant
numbers
to
engage
in
sexual
intercourse
despite
state's
ban
to
be
harmed
that
should
be
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
think
the
answer
would
be
the
same
regardless
of
the
age.
it
would
depend
on
the
onset
of
sexual
activity
with
the
minor.
as
long
as
they
are
minor
and
sexually
active,
i
believe
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
an
invasion,
and
intolerable
invasion
of
his
or
her
privacy
right
to
prohibit
or
limit
his
access
or
her
access
to
contraceptive
products.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
there's
no
minor
plaintiff
in
this
case,
and
if
you
like
to
return
and
discuss
these
standing
issues,
i
believe
the
question
of
standing
is
foreclosed
by
this
court's
december
20th
in
craig
v.
boren.
the
appellees
who
were
found
to
have
standing
by
the
three-judge
district
court,
or
population
planning
associates,
and
the
reverend
john
hagen.
they
are
vendors
and
advocates
of
the
sale
and
distribution
of
non
medical
contraceptive
products.
the
law
operates
correctly
against
them.
it
threatens
them
with
imprisonment
or
fine
for
taking
in
their
constitutionally
protected
activities.
if
they
abstain,
they
will
suffer
economic
loss.
we
believe
that
that
is
sufficient
under
craig
v.
boren
where
a
saloon
keeper
was
permitted
to
assert
third
party
constitutional
rights
to
sustain
the
three
judge
courts
upholding
of
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well
of
course
the
statute
in
this
case
prohibits
distribution
not
use.
it
doesn't
operate
against
the
intended
recipients
of
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
of
course,
he
was
a
proper
party
of
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
one
of
the
plaintiffs
whose
standing
was
not
considered
by
the
three
judge
district
court.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that's
correct,
and
he
also
asserted
that
he
was
the
father
of
two
minor
children
and
that
he
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well
that
is
a
basic
problem
in
privacy
of
litigation
in
this
area.
by
asserting
the
claim
there's
a
very
loss
of
privacy
which
one
seeks
to
protect.
there's
embarrassment
and
it's
for
those
reasons
that
the
court
has
relaxed
third
party
standing
in
its
past
privacy
cases.
in
many
of
the
cases,
in
eisenstadt,
and
indeed
even
in
griswold,
none
of
the
users
were
parties.
in
griswold
one
of
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
it's
because
the
least
challenger
is
the
vendor
and
the
distributor.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
believe
the
same
is
true
in
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
correct.
i
don't
believe
that
was
a
determinant
in
beholding
in
craig
v.
boren.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes,
the
plaintiff
population
planning
associates
which
was
found
to
have
standing
is
a
business
corporation
and
not
corporate
in
north
carolina
for
profit.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
direct
affiliation,
there
maybe
some
connection
in
that.
some
of
the
people
who
are
officers
and
warner
officers
in
another.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
am
not
directly
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
currently.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
we
represent
both
of
them.
i
believe
my
associate
just
informs
me
that
there
is
one
overlapping
member
on
the
boards
of--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
these
were
people
who
were
brought
to
us
by
our
clients
population
planning
associates
and
population
services
international.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes,
they
are.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
we
believe
and
urge
strenuously
that
access
to
contraceptives
is
encompassed
by
the
constitutional
privacy
right
and
a
series
of
decisions
commencing
with
the
griswold
case
in
1965,
this
court
has
made
a
plan
that
there
exists
a
fundamental
right
of
personal
privacy
which
prohibits
the
state
from
in
properly
intruding
into
a
citizen's
private
decision
whether
appropriate.
griswold
held
that
a
state
could
not
prohibit
use
of
contraceptives
by
a
married
couple.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes,
the
griswold
case
on
its
face
is
limited
in
that
fashion--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
the
court's
next
decision
in
this
area,
eisenstadt
v
baird
suggests
an
expansion--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
i
don't
believe
it
did
and
eisenstadt
v.
baird
though,
although
the
case
was
ultimately
decided
on
equal
protection
grounds,
the
court
held
that
the
right
of
privacy
existed
and
was
not
dependent
on
marital
status
but
also
applied
to
unmarried
persons.
in
roe
v.
wade
the
court
held
that
the
privacy
right
protected
a
woman's
decision
to
terminate
her
pregnancy
and
making
that
determination
of
whether
any
particular
personal
decision
is
included
within
the
privacy
right,
there
was
required
a
judicial
finding
that
the
right
asserted
was
fundamental
or
implicit
in
the
concept
declaratory.
in
roe,
inholding
that
the
abortion
decision
was
a
fundamental
personal
right
which
could
be
abridged
by
only
propelling
state
interest,
guidelines
were
established
which
in
lower
court's
view,
made
an
indisputable
that
access
to
contraceptives
also
was
fundamental
and
also
was
included
within
the
privacy
guarantee.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
new
york
has
such
a
statute
and
most
of
the
states
do
as
well.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
believe
it
is
18
your
honor.
no
serious
argument
has
ever
been
urged
that
the
intake
of
the
intoxicating
beverages
is
beneficial.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
constantino
decisions
mr.
chief
justice.
here
denying
access
to
contraceptives
demonstrably
results
in
harm
rather
than
benefits
to
the
citizens
of
new
york
and
particularly
to
the
minor
citizens
of
new
york.
the
saying
prima
face
by
denying
a
women
in
abortion
in
the
roe
case
is
found
here.
same
detrimental
consequences
to
mother
and
child
are
present
here
in
even
more
aggregated
fashion.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
unfortunately
the
effect
of
this
law
is
to
make
many
children
mothers.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
both
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
am
talking
about
as
the
teenager,
as
the
parent.
defendant
griswold,
individuals
have
a
right
to
use
contraceptives,
they
must
be
held
to
have
a
fundamental
right
to
obtain
them
otherwise
the
right
of
use
is
hollow
and
meaningless.
these
two
rights
are
inextricably
enmeshed
and
the
right
of
use
can
not
exist
unless
a
right
to
obtain
is
recognized.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
don't
believe
that,
that
would
be
constitutionally
mandated,
it
does
in
fact
exist
under
current
new
york
law
as
mandated
by
various
federal
programs
under
afdc
and
medicaid,
that
minors
who
were
sexually
active
and
as
per,
shall
be
provided
with
family
planning
services
including
contraceptives.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
oh,
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
those
cases
are
obscenity
cases
and
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
first
amendment
and
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well
that
case
was
severely
limited
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
believe
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
have
turned
what
was
first
amendment
case
into
a
very
limited
privacy
case.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that's
right
and
here
again
the
difference
being
that
no
argument
has
been
made
seriously
that
obscenity
is
beneficial
or
of
positive
use
to
the
recipient,
whereas
that
has
been
established
in
this
case.
if
i
may
turn
briefly
to
the
pharmacy
limitation,
in
contrast
to
what
learned
counsel
for
the
state
has
said,
the
number
of
pharmacies
that
exist
in
new
york
is
small
and
is
decreasing.
in
the
new
york
times
of
november
18,
it
was
stated
that
the
number
of
pharmacies
in
new
york
decreased
from
3380
in
1962
to
1832
in
1976
which
was
a
45%
decrease
and
in
that
same
article,
the
defendant
seeker
who
is
the
executive
secretary
of
the
new
york
state
board
of
pharmacy
was
corded
as
stating
that
new
york
state
has
lost
2500
drug
stores
in
the
last
20
years.
in
any
event
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes
but
there
is
no
proper
reason
why
these
products
should
be
limited
to
drug
stores.
there
is
no
health
reason
and
i
can
not
see
any
reason
why
the
our
state
could
permissibly
make
licensed
pharmacists
moral
guardians
of
new
york
citizens
and
it
is
to
demonstrate
that
the
restriction
is
very
real
restriction
but
the
number
of
drug
stores
is
small
but
those
that
are
open
or
not
accessible
always,
they
are
not
always
open
that
there
is
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
but
i
believe
a
pharmacist
availability
would
primarily
be
limited
to
pharmacies.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
but
the
end
result
for
new
york
citizens
is
the
same.
there
are
fewer
outlets
whereby
they
can
obtain
non
prescription
contraceptives
and
there
is
no
proper
health
reason
why
such
products
should
be
limited
to
sale
or
distribution
in
pharmacies.
they
are
prepackaged
and
there
is
no
need
for
the
state
to
insist
upon
quality
control.
the
state
has
failed
to
demonstrate
in
anyway
that
pharmacists
have
any
expertise
in
this
area.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
believe
i
said
mr
justice
marshall
that
if
they
could
demonstrate
a
compelling
state
interest,
it
could
be
regulated.
the
burden
is
not
upon
the
plaintiffs,
once
they
have
shown
that
fundamental
right
has
been
involved.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
if
they
could
demonstrate
that
there
was
a
proper
public
care
health
interest,
i
believe
they
could
or
if
as
they
have
failed
to
do
so
and
if
they
could
demonstrate
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
i
believe
that
the
limitation
would
be
a
public
health
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
products
which
affect
a
fundamental
constitutional
activity
would
have
to
be
supported
by
the
compelling
state
interest.
the
state
interest
in
regulating
morals,
if
it
exist
at
all
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
suffice.
the
state
has
of
course
not
made
any
such
narrow,
limited
findings
in
this
case.
the
statute
in
almost
all
respects
is
over
broad.
the
pharmacy
limitation
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
our
view.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
we
say
as
per
se
bad,
we
also
say
that
even
if
one
were
to
assume
arguendo
that
this
were
a
valid
purpose,
it
is
not
one
which
can
purport
the
statute
in
this
case
because
there
has
been
no
showing
that
the
statute
achieves
that
objective.
in
fact
the
showing
is
in
the
--
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
only
if
the
court
applies
the
most
lenient
and
critical
rational
basis
test,
could
it
rely
on
these
more,
supposed
legislative
end.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
not
necessarily.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
we
are
talking
here
about
a
different
issue,
the
ability
to
legislate
indirectly
rather
than
directly.
i
think
if
the
state
wants
to
--
if
again
assuming
arguendo
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
purpose
in
regulating
morality
that
it
could
do
so
only
in
a
fashion
which
does
not
punish
in
a
way
that
is
in
sense
akin
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
with
the
pregnancy,
abortion
or
venereal
disease
that
it
should
be
honest
and
open
in
it's
the
purpose,
and
legislate
directly.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
no,
it
is
not
inconsequential
but
that
again
is
a
different
case.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
well,
i
don't
think
that
our
rationale
carries
to
that
extent
or
that
far.
the
ability
to
legislate
directly
is
not
in
question
here.
what
is
in
question
here
is
the
effects
of
an
indirect
attempt
to
legislate
morality
and
to
pled
a
moral
(inaudible).
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
the
case
in
new
york.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
yes.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
n.
pollet
in
the
sense
that
the
state
may
have
narrow
area
which
can
impose
restrictions,
yes.
thank
you.
