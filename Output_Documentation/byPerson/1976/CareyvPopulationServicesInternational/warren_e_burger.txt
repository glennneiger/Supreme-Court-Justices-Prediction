mr.
pollet,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
before
you
get
started.
on
this
matter
of
age
of
marriage
in
new
york
state,
can
a
14
year
old
girl
get
married
without
the
consent
of
her
parents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and,
16
same
for
the
males
who
are
16?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
view
then
be
--
follow
up
almost
automatically
although
not
presented
in
this
case
that
the
new
york
statute
requiring
parental
consent
for
marriage
at
the
age
14,
16
is
equally
unconstitutional.
chief
justice
warren
e.

isn't
that
limiting
by
that
definition
that
you
have
suggested?
chief
justice
warren
e.

in
the
griswold
opinion
that
suggests
the
contrary
or
suggests
any
doubts
about
it?
chief

warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
talking
about
griswold
itself.
griswold
suggest
in
that
such
limitation,
did
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
power
of
the
state
of
new
york
or
of
any
state,
age
limit
on
the
acquisition
of
intoxicating
beverages
or
even
marginally
intoxicating
beverages
like
beer.

the
limit
in

18
or
21.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
the
constantino
case
suggest
that
or
if
it
suggests
if
the
right
is
to
be
deprived,
taking
away
there
must
be
some
due
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
a
fundamental
right
then
must
the
material
be
supplied
by
the
state
to
indigent
minors
under
age,
the
persons
under
age
16.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
this,
is
that
a
market
condition
kind
of
corner
grocery
stores
have
disappeared
in
the
face
of
super
markets,
that
was
similar
reduction
in
the
number
of
outlets
of
