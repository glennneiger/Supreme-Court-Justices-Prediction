mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
national
woodwork
as
mr.
come
said
this
court
canvas
at
least
the
beginning
of
this
problem
and
we
would
emphasize
that
it
did
not
reach
this
issue
not
because
it
was
forecasting
a
difference,
but
because
as
it
was
explicitly
stated
in
the
opinion,
the
union
did
not
take
a
cross
appeal
from,
did
not
file
a
cross
petition
from
the
portion
of
a
case
in
which
it
did
not
prevail,
and
therefore,
the
court
said
that
this
further
issue
was
not
before
them.
however,
we
do
not
believe
that
national
woodwork
is
immaterial
here.
the
court
did
not
simply
decide
a
case
on
its
facts,
as
five
court
of
appeals
recognized
thereafter,
it
stated
a
method
of
decision,
a
method
of
decision
for
determining
what
is
the
primary
dispute
is
stated
in
the
opinion
mr.
come
has
quoted
the
operative
language
and
its
whether
under
all
these
surrounding
circumstances,
the
union’s
objective
was
preservation
of
work
for
the
employees
and
this
is
my
addition
of
the
employer
who
signed
the
agreement
and
who
has
been
struck
and
now
going
back
to
the
court
or
whether
the
agreements
and
boycott
were
tactically
calculated
to
satisfy
union
objectives
elsewhere.
the
touchstone
is
whether
the
agreement
or
its
maintenance
is
addressed
to
the
labor
relations
of
the
contracting
employer,
these
are
his
only
employees.
that
would
not
attest
which
was
new,
but
as
the
opinion
demonstrates,
it
goes
all
away
back
to
the
basic
understanding,
beginning
with
duplex
verses
deering,
which
was
a
very
long
time
ago
and
during
all
the
intervening
time,
there
has
been
an
understanding
that
there
is
a
difference
between
primary
activity
and
secondary
boycott
and
that
the
essence
of
a
primary
activity
and
a
primary
strike
is
that
it
is
strike
by
employees
against
their
own
employer
in
defense
of
there
own
working
conditions.
we
quote...
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
justice
white,
in
national
woodwork,
the
court
left
open
the
question,
another
question
left
open
as
to
whether
a
primary
activity
is
only
the
defensive
traditional
work
or
that
it
includes
the
attempt
to
secure
additional
work.
our
position
would
be
that
the
essence
of
the
primary,
secondary
dichotomy
is
that
there
is
no
such
distinction.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
but
is
not
determinant
here
is
what
i
was
trying
to
say
because
here
there
is
a
square
finding
that
this
is
traditional
unit
work,
that
this
is
not
an
acquired
case
and
it
may
be
that
the
line
is
drawn
somewhere
and
that
we
are
correct
here
and
incorrect
in
our
further
assertion.
i
recognize
that
and
i
recognize
that
we
have
no
authority
supporting
the
position
i
was
arguing.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
tried,
our
view
is
that
at
a
certain
point
of
time
the
employer
and
his
employees
need
to
negotiate
a
collective
agreement.
at
that
point
there
is
no
agreement
by
hypothesis.
if
the
union
seeks
a
secondary
agreement,
it
is
violating
8(b)4(a)
and
8(e)
that
is
the
change
of
the
law….
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
affected
in
1959
so
it
can
only
seek
a
lawful
agreement
in
the
first
place
and
therefore
the
agreement
does
not
change
anything
here.
it
is
simply
evidence
that
that
was
the
union
was
seeking
to
preserve
its
traditional
work
and
it
is
also
relevant
secondarily,
i
would
say
because,
it
demonstrates,
what
is
to
us
a
very
strange
set
of
priorities
and
equities,
as
the
board
views
the
matter.
it
so
happens
that
here
the
contract
was
first
the
collective
agreement.
at
that
point
the
board
as
we
read
its
opinion,
it
expressly
recognizes
that
the
union
could
negotiate
a
contract
and
then
the
board
says
that
the
employer
subsequently
can
go
and
negotiate
a
contract
with
another
employer
turned
himself
from
a
primarily
into
a
neutral
and
neutralize
the
union’s
ability
to
enforce
the
agreement
by
it's
normal
method
of
the
strike
against
the
employer
with
whom
it
had
the
lawful
agreement.
now,
the
board
suggests
in
its
reply
brief
in
point
one
of
the
reply
brief
that
we
overstate
the
proposition,
we
overstate
the
test
of
what
is
primarily
activity
because
there
can
be
some
situations
in
which
the
employees
own
conditions
are
matters
which
they
cannot
validly
strike
(inaudible)
and
they
give
the
example,
suppose
the
employees
wish
to
have
a
clause
in
the
agreement
saying
that
they
do
not
have
to
work
on
a
job
where
other
employers
employ
non
union
men
or
suppose
that
they
negotiate,
asked
to
negotiate
an
agreement
saying
that
they
do
not
have
to
handle
goods
coming
from
a
struck
plant.
but
we
have
not
used
the
term
working
conditions
in
a
limitless
sense.
in
a
one
view
of
world
we
would
far
prefer
working
conditions
could
be
anything
that
affect
employees,
but
we
recognized
that
in
those
two
situations,
which
are
the
situations
of
the
denver
building
case
and
the
issue
covered
by
8(e),
congress
has
decided
that
while
you
could
reformulate
the
matter
to
say
that
the
immediate
employees,
who
do
not
want
to
work
on
the
same
job
site
with
non
union
people
are
having
their
working
conditions
affected,
it
is
only
in
the
most
remote
way
and
that
the
real
problem
is
the
problem
between
the
another
employer,
namely
whether
he
is
going
to
recognize
the
union
and
his
own
employees
and
is
only
a
derivative
affect.
here
the
question
of
whether
there
is
going
to
be
a
work
preservation
agreement
and
whether
these
pipe
fitters
and
steamfitters
are
going
to
do
the
work
they
have
done
for
years
is
an
immediate
and
direct
concern
to
them.
if
they
worked
fewer
hours,
if
they
have
less
work,
fewer
the
more
work
obviously.
their
wage
rates,
however
high
they
may
be
multiplied
by
fewer
hours.
they
are
directly
and
immediately
threatened
in
the
most
basic
ways
and
we
think
that
the
distinction
between
the
case
here
where
the
whole
pattern
of
the
act
sanctions,
the
unions
concerned
and
denominated
working
conditions,
these
employees
own
working
conditions
and
the
situation
where
the
employees
are
really
interested
in
the
working
conditions
and
the
employment
relationship
between
other
employers
is
plain.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
in
this
case.
hudik
was
dealing
with
the
union
on
behalf
of
the
people
he
normally
employed.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
these
are
the
kinds
of
calculations
that
both
the
employers
and
unions
and
their
members
have
to
make
all
the
time.
the
union
is
saying
“our
long
run
interest
is
preserving
this
traditional
work.”
the
employer’s
reply
argument
is
that
“i
will
not
be
able
to
bid
and
secure
as
much
work
as
i
otherwise
would.”
and
the
union
says
that
“we
are
prepared
for
that
test.
that
is
our
calculation
and
that
is
our
gamble.”
that
is
no
different
from
the
union
saying,
“we
want
to
work
for
$8
an
hour”
and
the
employer
saying,
“most
of
the
bids
come
out
in
a
way
which
means,
that
if
my
labor
costs
are
over
750,
i
cannot
secure
the
work.”
the
union
says,
“we
think
the
labor,
there
is
more
elasticity
in
the
bid
market
than
you
say.
we
think
that
we
can
organize
enough
of
the
workers
in
this
area,
so
that
we
can
maintain
our
labor
condition
and
we
insist
on
the
conditions
we
ask.”
the
whole
theory
of
the
act
is
that
a
matter
like
that
is
to
be
worked
out
between
the
employer
and
his
employees
and
they
are
represented
it
through
bargaining.
if
the
union
is
wrong
it
is
wrong,
but
that
does
not
mean
it
is
not
seeking
to
preserve
its
traditional
standards
or
in
the
wage
case
i
gave
to
get
the
wagers
that
the
employees
believe
are
worthwhile
for
their
work
and
to
denominate
that
as
turning
from
primary
to
secondary,
if
the
employer
accepts
a
bid
for
750
and
then
says,
“i
no
longer
can
pay
you
$8,
which
is
really
the
board’s
theory,
because
i
no
longer
have
control
over
the
matter,”
it
seems
to
us
to
be
a
perversion
of
the
whole
theory
of
the
act.
the
board’s
position,
as
mr.
come
has
indicated
is
that
an
employer,
who
cannot
give
the
employees
immediate
satisfaction
without
changing
an
agreement,
he
has
subsequently
reached
with
someone
else,
is
a
neutral.
it
seems
to
us
to
be
defective
on
many,
many
scores.
let
me
begin
with
one
which
has
already
been
explored
and
that
is
once
the
two
employers
have
reached
their
agreement.
who
is
the
primary,
and
there
are
two
possible
answers.
the
board
first
ventured
the
answer
in
the
western
monolithics
case,
which
mr.
come
mentioned,
which
is
a
ninth
circuit
case
which
eventually
became
a
ninth
circuit
case,
that
the
general
contractor
becomes
the
primary
because
he
has
the
right
of
control.
the
ninth
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
judge
eugene
wright
said
“no,
you
cannot
say
that
the
general
contractor
with
whom
the
union
has
no
contacts
does
not
bargain,
he
does
not
employ
any
of
their
members
is
the
primary
and
the
board
was
reversed.
as
mr.
come
indicates,
subsequently
in
the
board
case,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
no
one
is
the
primary,
that
whereas
at
the
time
the
agreement
was
negotiated,
the
union
would
have
had
the
right
of
enforcement.
once
their
employer
enters
into
an
agreement
with
somebody
else,
there
is
no
primary
and
we
think
that
that
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
whole
theory
of
the
act.
as
i
was
indicating
in
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
as
this
court
has
reiterated
time
and
again,
most
recently
in
the
machines
case,
preemption
case
last
year,
the
theory
of
the
act
is
to
center
a
labor
conflict
in
the
bargaining
unit
of
an
employer
and
his
employees
and
the
theory
of
the
act
is
that
so
long
is
it
dealing
with
lawful
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining,
what
the
wages
are,
what
work
the
employees
will
insist
on
doing.
that
is
a
matter
not
to
be
settled,
not
by
outside
parties,
but
by
a
test
of
economic
strength,
if
reason
is
either
side
sees
it
fails
and
to
say
that
employers
can
by
agreements
among
themselves,
change
the
situation
entirely
and
create
a
situation
where
even
though
the
union
does
not
enter
into
a
no
strike
clause
and
thereby
retains
its
right
to
enforce
its
agreement
by
its
normal
strike
weapon,
it
has
lost
that
strike
weapon,
it
has
nobody
against
whom
it
could
employ
economic
force
if
there
is
no
primary
dispute.
it
seems
to
us
to
be
flatly
and
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
genius
of
this
act.
i
would
like
in
conclusion,
because
i
think
my
time
is
up.
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
turn
to
a
discussion
of
two
cases
in
this
court
upon
which
the
board
places
reliance
and
which
we
think
they
misunderstand.
the
first
is
the
denver
building
case.
in
denver
building,
the
crux
of
the
dispute
was
the
fact
“a”
subcontractor
on
a
jobsite
was
employing
non-union
labor.
the
unions
who
are
concerned
about
that
did
not
go
to
the
subcontractor.
rather
they
went
to
the
general
contractor
and
told
him
that
they
wanted
the
subcontractor
off
the
job
or
convert
it
into
a
union
contractor
or
else
they
were
going
to
strike
and
the
board
found
that
that
was
a
violation
of
8(b)(4)(b).
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
plainness
of
denver
building
trades
is
that
the
–
who
has
the
ultimate
economic
control
is
not
determined.
it
is
plain
that
the
general
contractor
in
the
denver
case
had
the
right
of
control.
he
could
both
originally
as
you
were
pointing
out
mr.
justice
stewart,
have
given
the
contract
to
somebody
else
and
he
could
have
terminated
the
contractor.
he
could
have
told
the
subcontractor
that
he
had
to
operate
union
on
that
job,
at
least
or
maybe
over
all.
yet,
the
board
found
and
this
court
agreed
that
that
was
a
secondary
boycott.
we
do
not
understand
how
the
board
can
draw
any
conflict
from
the
proposition
that
a
union
which
has
its
real
dispute
with
a
sub
can
strike
the
general
when
right
here
what
the
union
is
trying
to
do
is
strike
the
sub
who
is
the
person
who
employs
the
employees
who
have
a
complaint
and
the
person
who
entered
into
the
collective
agreement
which
begins
the
matter
in
the
first
place.
the
second
case
in
this
court
that
the
board
mentions,
second
case
that
the
board
mentions
in
this
court
is
the
sand
door
case,
the
carpenter’s
case
in
357
u.s.
which
mr.
come
has
mentioned.
prior
to
1959
and
under
the
sand
door
rule,
there
were
agreements
that
the
parties
could
enter
into
which
were
lawful,
but
which
the
union
could
not
enforce
by
collective
economic
action,
even
against
the
employer
with
whom
they
had
entered
into
the
agreement.
the
theory
of
sand
door
with
which
we
agree
is
that
while
both
contracts
were
lawful
under
the
statute
as
it
stood
then,
they
could
not
turn
what
was
otherwise
a
secondary
boycott
into
primary
activity
and
we
do
not
argue
here
that
the
original
agreement
turn
what
would
otherwise
be
secondary
activity
into
primary
activity.
we
simply
say
that
the
original
agreement
was
a
traditional…
mr.
laurence
gold
i
am
sorry,
the
original
agreement
between
the
union
and
hudik,
containing
the
work
preservation.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
the
original
collective…
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
the
original
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
was
a
time
there,
it
was
an
agreement
on
a
primary
subject
and
that
the
enforcement
is
also
on
a
primary,
is
by
perforce
primary.
mr.
laurence
gold
yeah,
what
i
am
trying
to
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
original,
you
test
the
original
agreement
by
the
standard
stated
in
national
woodwork.
is
the
agreement
addressed
to
preserving
the
work
of
the
employees,
the
type
of
work
they
have
done
on
the
jobsite
and
the
answer
in
this
case
is,
yes,
just
as
it
was
in
the
national
woodwork
and
you
test
the
enforcement
of
the
agreement
by
the
same
standard
and
the
answer
again
is
yes,
because
what
the
employees
are
trying
to
do
is
to
assure
that
the
employer
continues
to
observe
that
agreement
which
they
feel
is
in
their
basic
long-term
interest,
that…
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
agreement
if
it
had
been
lived
up
to,
would
have
those
consequences
right
from
the
first
day,
it
is
inevitable
that
the
agreement
has
consequences.
once
hudik
enters
into
the
agreement,
if
he
is
in
good
faith,
he
has
a
limitation
on
the
terms
upon
which
he
can
do
business
with
third
persons.
he
either
is
going
to
limit
his
bids
to
situations
in
which
the
bid
is
one
he
can
accept
without
violating
his
agreement
or
is
not
and
that
is
one
of
the
plain
consequences
of
every
agreement,
whether
it
is
an
agreement
on
hours,
or
an
agreement
on
what
type
of
work
the
employees
demand
as
a
condition
of
doing
any
work,
and
that
is
one
of
its
intended
effects,
it
is
an
inescapable
effect.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
mr.
justice
white,
we
do
not…
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
this
kind
of
contract
is
lawful
in
the
construction
industry
and
out
of
the
construction
industry…
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
it
is
not
clear
whether
they
say
that
it…
mr.
laurence
gold
we
do
not
understand
after
1959,
how
we
could
enforce
it
in
a
301
action
if
the
board
prevails
here
because
what
congress
did
in
1959
was
say,
that
there
is
a
unity
between
what
the
type
of
agreement
you
can
enter
into
and
a
type
of
agreement
you
can
enforce
by
economic
pressure
and
since
there
is
such
a
unity,
what
we
think
is
happening
is
that
we
are
been
chopped
down
piece
by
piece.
first
we
are
told
that
we
cannot
enforce
it
because
it
would
be
a
violation
of
8(b)(4)(b),
then
the
next
step
will
be
that
since
it
is
a
violation
of
8(b)(4)(b)
to
enforce
it
insisting
on
enforcement
demonstrates
that
it
is
a
8(e)
violation.
mr.
laurence
gold
absolutely,
i
mean
that
is
what
we
are
saying,
i
just
want
to
make
one
thing
clear
because
i
do
not
want
to
take
advantage
of
a
question
which
i
believe
aides
my
cause
and
then
find
out
and
misunderstood
it.
we
are
not
saying
that
this
contract
is
legal
because
of
the
so
called
construction
industry
proviso
to
section
8(e).
we
are
saying
that
this
is
a
primary
clause.
it
would
be
lawful
in
the
construction
industry
or
in
any
other
industry…
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
no
it
is
just
that…
mr.
laurence
gold
my
understanding
is
that
the
construction
industry
proviso
does
not
cover
this
case
because…
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
because
our
understanding
is
that
it
relates
only
to
contracting
and
subcontracting
of
work
on
a
site
and
here
the
problem
is
in
part,
a
problem
of
what
work
is
to
be
done
offsite
and
what
work
is
to
be
done
onsite.
therefore,
our
source
of
validation
is
that
the
agreement,
the
desire
of
these
employees
to
preserve
their
traditional
work
is
a
primary
demand.
it
is
the
same
type
of
demand
a
group
of
factory
workers
could
make,
saying
we
do
not
want
you
to
contract
out
assembly
line
work
which
we
have
always
done
in
this
plant.
mr.
laurence
gold
absolutely
and
i
cannot
add
to
that
and
i
will
not
try.
i
want
to
point
out
although
it
is
a
secondary
aspect
of
our
argument
that
the
board
says
that
we
must
have
an
object,
a
secondary
object
in
this
case
because
the
employer
has
only
two
choices.
either
he
can
cease
doing,
the
employer
hudik,
either
he
can
cease
doing
business
with
austin
or
he
can
attempt
to
get
a
change
in
the
agreement
between
austin
and
himself
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
there
is
a
third
option.
if
somebody
breaches
an
agreement,
he
can
seek
to
pay
a
premium
or
some
other
compensation
for
the
breaching
dead
on
with
the
work
as
mr.
come
indicates
that
is
not
a
choice
that
any
contract
breaker
really
relishes,
but
to
say
that
it
does
not
exist
and
that
there
are
only
two
choices
seems
to
us
to
be
illogical
in
the
extreme.
finally,
i
do
want
to
note
–
i
do
want
to
take
up
a
point
that
the
board
makes
in
its
reply
brief
in
terms
of
the
so
called
secondary
object
conjoined
with
primary
object.
it
is
our
view
that
that
type
of
approach
destroys
the
primary
secondary
dichotomy.
let
me
give
two
examples
in
addition
to
the
example
here
to
show
that
this
is
not
a
sue
generous
situation.
suppose
that
the
employees
meet
and
discuss
the
matter
among
themselves
and
decide
that
they
do
not
want
to
work
weekends,
that
is
hardly
an
unrealistic
hypothetical
as
the
members
of
the
court
who
heard
the
jewel
tea
case.
well
remember,
thereafter
their
employer
enters
into
an
agreement
with
somebody
else
which
requires
him
to
have
three
shifts,
seven
days
a
week
in
order
to
complete
the
work.
as
we
understand
the
board’s
theory,
this
primary
agreement
becomes
unenforceable,
because
the
employer
has
given
away
his
right
of
control,
he
would
have
to
renegotiate
his
agreement
with
the
general
contractor
from
whom
he
accepted
this
bid,
knowing
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
agreement
he
had
made
with
the
union.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
hours,
whether
employee
who
work
8
to
4
and
whether
they
work
mondays…
mr.
laurence
gold
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
do
not
understand…
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
they
are
the
pieces
that
the
employees
refuse
to
work
at
all
unless
he
no
longer
requires
him
to
work
on
weekends
as
a
condition
of
their
continued
employment.
that
would
be
precisely
this
case.
in
other
words,
here
the
employer
says,
“you
do
this
work,
but
you
do
not
get
to
do
the
other
work
you
want.
in
the
case
i
am
positing”
the
employer
says,
“if
you
want
to
continue
to
work
for
me,
you
have
to
do
the
work
on
weekends.”
they
say,
“no,
we
do
not
want
to
work
on
weekends.”
he
says
“that
is
the
matter
outside
my
control
now,
i
have
agreed
with
the
general
contractor
to
run
three
shifts”
and
it
seems…
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not
think
that…
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
employer…
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
is,
i
do
not
know
if
you
are
referring
to…
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
in
the
hypothetical
example,
the
employees
will
not
do
the
work
that
the
third
party
tenders
under
the
agreement.
well,
let
me
just…
mr.
laurence
gold
oh,
that
is
right
and
part
of
the
agreement
between
the
employer,
in
other
words…
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
i
apologize;
obviously
i
do
not
want
to
give
examples
which
do
not
further
my
argument,
when
i
feel
the
argument
stand
on
its
merits.
it
is
just
that
the
board
says
that
this
situation
is
sue
generous.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is,
we
think
the
problem
is
the
same
whenever
employees
negotiate
an
agreement
with
their
own
employer
and
then
that
employer
enters
into
an
inconsistent
contract
with
the
third
person
say
you
can
not
enforce
your
collective
agreement
against
me
because
i
am
now
a
neutral.
mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you.
