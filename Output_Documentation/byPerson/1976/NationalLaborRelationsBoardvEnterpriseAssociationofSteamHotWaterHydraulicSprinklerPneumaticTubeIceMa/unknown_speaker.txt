unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
come,
assume
there
has
been
no
provision
in
the
contract
and
that
the
strike
otherwise
would
not
have
violated
the
contract,
the
result
would
have
been
the
same.
unknown
speaker
well,
actually
that
is
the
reason
we
expressed
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
but
this
court’s
decision
in
national
woodwork
upheld
the
determination
of
the
board.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
mr.
norton
j.
come,
there
was
another
alternative.
it
could
perhaps
negotiate
with
his
employees
in
payment
of
bonus,
to
installing
the
ducts.
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
violated
the
work
preservation
clause?
unknown
speaker
what
could
the
union
do
to
protect
its
own
contract?
unknown
speaker
protected
itself
in
the
negotiation
of
the
contract
by
having
a
provision
in
that
to
limit
the
preservation?
unknown
speaker
could
not
they
have
changed
the
preservation
clause
and
add
a
reference
so
that
there
would
be
provisos
in
there,
which
would
cover
their
situation…
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
employer,
could
have
protected
himself
by
putting
a
proviso
in
the
preservation
clause
which
said
except
where
we
get
this
like
we
have
got
now,
he
could
have
put
that
in
the
contract…
unknown
speaker
it
could,
in
the
board’s
view
in
this
case
could,
the
union
legitimately
have
applied
economic
pressure
to
austin?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
it
is
important
to
know
in
order
to
properly
decide
this
case,
assuming
that
you
have
a
legitimate
work
preservation
provision
with
collected
bargaining
agreement
which
i
believe
is
the
premise
and
the
assumption
on
which
we
are
proceeding
in
this
case
and
since
the
woodworking
case
held
that
economic
pressure
could
be
exerted
to
enforce
such
an
agreement,
it
is
important,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
although
the
board’s
position
is
to
whether
or
not
the
union
is
free
to
exert
economic
pressure
against
austin
because
if
not,
than
it
is
not
free
to
exert
economic
pressure
against
anybody
to
enforce
and
effectuate
the
work
preservation
agreement
that
woodworking
stands
off
as
it
holds,
it
can
be
enforced
by
economic
pressure.
unknown
speaker
you
think
austin
in
this
case
would
have
been
with
or
without
power
to
exceed?
unknown
speaker
only
by
renegotiation
of
his
contract
with
hudik,
is
it
not?
he
would
have
no
more,
no
less
power
that
you
tell
us
hudik
has,
each
would
involve
the
renegotiation
of
the
contract,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
i
am
telling
about
the
time
at
which
economic
pressure
was
applied
in
this
case.
my
question
was
could
it
have
legitimately
and
legally
under
the
labor
law
then
applied
against
austin
and
you
refuse
to
try
and
answer
that.
unknown
speaker
i
am
suggesting
only
that
it
seems
to
me
in
light
of
woodworking
which
certainly
stands
for
the
proposition
at
a
work
preservation
clause,
such
as
this
assuming
it
is
legitimate
one
and
that
is
the
assumption
here,
can
be
enforced
by
a
union,
by
the
application
of
economic
sanction.
it
is
important
i
would
say
that
in
this
case
to
know
whether
that
could
be
enforced
against
anybody,
the
economic
sanction
or
whether
in
a
case
like
this
whether
there
is
a
subcontract
that
woodworking
becomes
a
dead
letter.
unknown
speaker
it
is
seeking
to
effectuate
its
work
preservation
clause
that
it
is
negotiated
through
collective
bargaining
and
as
succeeding
and
getting
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
woodworkers
said
that
there
was
a
proper
and
legitimate
objective
and
if
the
answer
to
my
question
would
let
us
know
whether
in
the
context
of
this
case,
where
it
was
saying
that
it
cannot
enforce,
effectuate
that
against
anybody
or
simply
that
it
cannot
effectuate
it
against
hudik,
but
could
against
austin,
and
i
think
that’s
some
importance.
unknown
speaker
so
take
a
position
on
static,
right?
are
you
suggesting
that
austin
would
have
any
more
or
less
control
on
hudik?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
the
critical
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
not
the
critical
time.
i
am
talking
about
the
time
when
economic
pressure
was
actually
exerted,
because
hudik
before
he
negotiated
any
contract
would
have
been
equally
free
to
accede.
unknown
speaker
had
the
economic
pressure
had
been
applied
against
hudik
before
he
ever
entered
into
this
subcontract,
he
would
have
been
equally
free
to
accede
and
do
not
have
entered
into
that
subcontract.
unknown
speaker
if
when
the
pressure
was
applied
here,
the
principal
contractor
said,
oh,
go
ahead
and
use
what
calling
up
on
the
phone,
i
understand
you
are
having
trouble
with
the
labor,
just
go
ahead
and
use
whatever
doors
you
want,
this
case
would
have
come
out
differently.
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
been
within
his
power
to
accede.
unknown
speaker
but
your
search
point.
unknown
speaker
but
even
in
the
absence
of
any
work
preservation
clause
at
all,
the
result
should
come
out
your
way
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
the
sand
door.
unknown
speaker
mr.
laurence
gold
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
throws
any
light
on
the
question
of
whether
hudik
as
a
construction
industry
subcontractor
here
had
a
regular
permanent
cadre
of
workers
or
whether
he
might
have
just
gotten
workers
by
the
job
from
the
construction
home,
from
the
hiring
home?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
just
got
people
from
a
hiring
home
on
a
job
basis,
there
certainly
would
appear
to
be
something
to
the
board’s
contention
that
these
people
never
would
have
had
a
job
at
all
if
he
had
not
bid
on
this
contract.
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
the
original
agreement?
unknown
speaker
collective
bargaining
rates.
unknown
speaker
including
work
preservation,
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
to
that
is
no,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in
terms
of
validating
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
putting
it
a
little
different,
your
contention
if
the
contract
is
legal
is
because
you
understand
that
it
is
within
the
rationale
of
national
woodwork,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
agreement
would
not
be
covered
by
the
language
of
statute,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
let
us
have
the
language
of
8(b)(4)(b).
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
do
not
think
your
hypothetical
would
come
within
8(b)(4)(b).
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
the
language
of
8(b)(4)(b)
covers
the
hours
of
work
in
agreement
to
work
seven
days
a
week
at
all,
i
just
do
not
think
the
language
applies…
unknown
speaker
not
ceasing
to
do
business
with
another
employer.
unknown
speaker
the
basic
language,
i
think
the
basic
prohibition
in
8(b)(4)(b)
just
does
not
fit
that
example
as
i
read
it.
unknown
speaker
see
here
are
you
saying
you
cannot
do
work
on
these
other,
on
the
product
bought
on
the
third
party.
if
you
do
not
have
the
third
party
situation,
i
do
not
think
any
hypothetical
example.
unknown
speaker
they
will
do
it
for
five
days
and
not
for
seven.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
should,
i
am
sorry,
i
should
not…
