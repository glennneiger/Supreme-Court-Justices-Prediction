mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
sitting
on
banc
and
dividing
five
to
four,
denied
enforcement
of
the
board’s
order
against
responding
union.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
union
engages
in
an
unlawful
secondary
boycott
within
the
meaning
of
section
8(b)4(b)
of
the
national
labors
relations
act,
when
it
causes
the
employees
of
a
firm
of
which
the
union
has
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
containing
a
work
preservation
clause
to
handle
prefabricated
goods
that
their
employers
contract
with
the
general
contractor
obliges
the
employer
to
install.
this
was
a
question
which
was
mooted,
but
not
decided
in
national
woodwork,
a
1967
decision
of
this
court.
the
facts
are
briefly
these.
austin
the
engineer
and
general
contractor
for
construction
of
a
home
for
the
aged
in
brooklyn,
specified
the
use
of
climate
control
units,
manufactured
by
slant/fin
corporation.
under
these
specifications,
slant/fin
was
to
cut
thread
and
install
at
the
factory
the
internal
piping
on
the
units
which
carried
a
one-year
warranty
contingent
upon
factory
fabrication
of
the
internal
piping.
as
a
result
of
competitive
bidding,
austin
awarded
a
subcontract
for
the
heating,
ventilating
and
air
conditioning
work
on
the
home
to
hudik.
this
work
included
as
hudik
was
aware,
installation
of
the
slant/fin
units.
now
hudik,
the
subcontractor
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
respondent
union,
a
local
of
the
plumbers
and
steamfitters
union.
rule
ix
of
this
agreement
provided
among
other
things
that
radiators
branches,
convector
branches
and
coil
connections
shall
be
cut
and
threaded
by
hand
on
the
job.
shortly
after
the
slant/fin
units
which
had
been
purchased
by
austin
arrived
on
the
job
site,
the
union
business
agent
went
to
austin,
the
general
contractor
and
informed
him,
his
project
superintendent,
the
union’s
members
would
not
install
the
slant/fin
units
because
the
piping
inside
the
units
was
steamfitter’s
work
and
the
business
agent
then
went
to
hudik
and
told
him
essentially
the
same
thing,
adding
that
the
prefabrication
of
the
internal
piping
in
the
units
was
in
violation
of
rule
ix
of
the
collective
agreement.
as
a
result,
hudik’s
employees
refused
to
install
the
slant/fin
units,
where
upon
austin
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
board.
the
board
concluded
that
the
union’s
refusal
to
install
the
slant/fin
units
was
a
secondary
boycott
in
violation
of
section
8(b)4(b)
because
the
board
found
it,
while
the
refusal
of
hudik’s
employees
to
install
these
units
was
based
on
a
valid
work
preservation
clause
in
the
agreement
with
hudik
and
was
to
the
purpose
of
preservation
work
they
had
traditionally
performed,
hudik
was
incapable
of
assigning
this
work
to
his
employees,
and
therefore,
the
union
in
exerting
strike
pressure
on
hudik,
had
coupled
it's
work
preservation
objective
with
an
unlawful
secondary
objective
of
also
trying
to
change
austin’s
manner
of
doing
business
with
slant/fin.
now,
board
entered
an
appropriate
remedial
order
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
indicated
denied
enforcement
of
the
board’s
order,
the
court,
majority
of
the
court
finding
that
the
board’s
reliance
upon
hudik’s
lack
of
power
to
assign
the
work
was
inconsistent
with
the
principles
annunciated
by
this
court
in
national
woodwork.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
national
woodwork,
section
8(b)4(b)
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
it's
agents
to
exert
strike
pressure
against
an
employer
for
an
object,
of
forcing
any
person
to
cease
using
handling
or
otherwise
dealing
in
the
products
of
any
other
person
or
to
cease
doing
business
with
any
other
person.
a
proviso
states
that
this
provision
shall
not
be
construed
to
make
unlawful,
any
primary
strike
or
primary
pickets.
now,
as
this
court
recognized
shortly
after
the
47
amendments
which
added
the
secondary
boycott
provision
to
the
act
that
section
8(b)4(b)
must
be
interpreted
so
as
to
foster
the
dual
congressional
objective
of
preserving
the
right
of
labor
organizations
to
bring
pressure
on
offending
employers
and
primary
labor
disputes,
and
of
shielding
unoffending
employers
from
pressures
and
controversies
not
their
own.
now,
the
text
of
achieving
this
accommodation
is
a
very,
very
difficult
one.
for
the
distinction
between
legitimate
primary
and
illegal
secondary
activity
as
this
court
has
indicated
is
rarely
a
glaringly
price
line.
union
activity
is
secondary,
if
an
object
of
the
activity
is
to
force
cessation
of
a
change
in
business
relations
between
two
entities.
on
the
other
hand,
the
objectives
of
even
primary
activity
includes
the
desire
to
influence
others
to
withhold
their
patronage
from
the
employer
against
whom
the
pressure
is
exerted
and
some
union
activity,
which
i
submit
is
this
case,
who
have
both
a
primary
object
and
a
secondary
object
and
in
that
event
the
activity
is
unlawful
for
section
8(b)(4)
prescribes
activity,
if
an
object
is
secondary.
now,
let
me
illustrate
the
way
these
principles
were
applied
in
national
woodwork
and
try
to
point
out
the
difference
that
the
board
sees
between
the
situation
here
and
that
which
was
before
the
court
in
national
woodwork.
the
issue
in
national
woodwork
was
whether
a
union
that
engaged
in
a
lawful
secondary
boycott
by
refusing
to
permit
its
members
who
are
employed
by
frouge
a
general
contractor
to
install
prefabricated
doors.
finishing
doors
was
worked
and
frouge’s
employees
had
traditionally
performed
on
the
job
site
and
the
collective
agreement
had
a
work
preservation
clause
similar
to
one
here
which
provided
that
frouge’s
employees
would
not
be
required
to
handle
doors
if
it
has
been
finished
off
the
job
site.
the
employees
struck
when
frouge
nevertheless
ordered
the
pre-finished
doors,
although
he
was
not
required
to
do
so,
on
his
contract
with
the
project
owner.
the
court
stated
that
the
determination
whether
the
union’s
activity
was
primary
or
secondary
turned
on
whether
hope
from
the
court
under
all
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
union’s
object
was
preservation
of
work
for
frouge's
employees
or
whether
the
agreements
and
the
boycott
were
tactically
calculated
to
satisfy
union
objectives
elsewhere.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
think
that
the
contract
does
not
make
the
difference.
the
question
is
whether
the
activity
that
was
engaged
in
is
secondary
or
primary.
now,
applying
the
text
that
i
outlined
to
the
facts
in
national
woodwork,
the
court
found
that
the
contract
clause
was
a
valid
work
preservation
clause,
therefore,
no
violation
of
8(e)
and
that
the
facts
established
that
the
union’s
object
in
invoking
the
clause
against
frouge
was
solely
the
preservation
of
the
traditional
task
of
jobsite
carpenters.
frouge
had
the
option
of
prescribing
pre-finished
doors
or
not
prescribing
it,
it
elected
to
order
them
and
that
got
him
into
his
problem
with
the
union.
now,
the
facts
here
we
submit,
are
different
from
the
situation
in
national
woodwork
and
i
might
say
that
at
the
same
time
that
the
board
decided
national
woodwork,
in
that
very
case,
you
had
three
subcontractors
who
were
in
precisely
the
same
situation
that
hudik
was
in
here,
the
board
had
found
an
8(b)(4)(b)
violation
as
to
them,
the
court
of
appeals
had
sustained
that
finding,
but
the
union
did
not
bring
that
before
the
court
and
was
for
that
reason
that
that
issue
was
not
before
the
court
in
national
woodwork.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
upheld
the
determination
of
the
board
as
to
frouge
who
have
the
power
to
control
whether
or
not,
his
employees
were
to
pay
the
price
of
the
work
of
finishing
the
doors.
in
contrast,
the
frouge,
who
was
free
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
use
prefabricated
doors,
hudik
was
obligated
by
his
contract
with
austin
to
install
the
prefabricated
climate
control
units?
by
demanding
that
hudik’s
employees
perform
on
the
jobsite,
the
internal
piping
work
on
these
climate
control
units,
the
unit
was
seeking
work
that
hudik
never
possessed
and
did
not
have
a
right
to
obtain.
confronted
by
the
union’s
demands
of
the
work,
hudik
as
a
practical
matter
had
available
only
two
courses
of
action.
it
could
have
induced,
try
to
induce
austin
to
change
his
specifications
for
the
job
or
failing
that
to
terminate
his
contract
with
austin.
the
second
course,
like
a
refusal
to
bid
on
the
job
initially,
would
not
have
preserved
or
produced
work
for
hudik’s
employees,
indeed
it
would
have
be
a
loss
for
them,
the
rest
of
the
piping
work
that
they
had
on
this
job,
the
first
course
inducing…
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
court
of
appeals
mentions
that
alternative
your
honor.
on
this
record
there
was
no
suggestion
that
that
was
ever
contemplated
by
the
union.
on
this
record,
the
demand
was
solely
for
the
work.
now,
the
first
course
namely
inducing
austin
to
change
its
specification
would
have
produced
this
work
only
if
austin
were
willing
to
do
that,
so
that
in
these
circumstances,
you
find
that
whereas
the
union,
to
be
sure,
may
have
been
motivated
by
a
work
preservation
object.
it
could
not
have
obtained
that
object
without
changing
the
decision
of
austin
and
possibly
also
slant/fin
whereas
in
the
frouge
case,
frouge
could
have
granted
the
union’s
demand,
primarily
changing
its
own
decision,
discontinuing
ordering
pre-finished
doors.
now,
granted
that
the
line
between
whether
a
cessation
of
business
is
an
object
or
whether
it
is
just
an
incident
of
lawful
primary
activity,
granted
that
that
line
is
a
fine
one
and
it
is
difficult
in
some
cases
to
find
out
which
site
is
aligned,
it
falls
on,
we
submit
that
it
was
at
least
within
the
board’s
province
to
conclude
and
was
reasonable
in
so
concluding
that
given
a
situation
such
as
you
have
here
or
in
order
to
attain
the
union’s
work
preservation
objective,
the
employer
pressure,
even
though
he
was
the
employer
of
the
employees
involved
and
only
give
them
what
they
sought
by
changing
the
decisions
of
third
parties.
that
involves
too
much
of
a
impairment
of
the
rights
of
third
parties
to
be
regarded
as
purely
incidental
to
legitimate
primary
activity
and
for
that
reason
that
the
board
was
awarded
and
concluding
that
the
union’s
pressure
here
at
least
an
object
included
an
unlawful
secondary
one
describe
by
it
8(b)4.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
did
not
have
an
8(e)
charge
attacking
the
validity
of
the
work
preservation
clause.
it
assumed
that
the
work
preservation
clause
was
lawful
because
on
its
face
it
was
susceptible
of
being
applied
in
a
lawful
situation
and
as
i
indicated
in
my
answer
to
justice
white’s
conclusion,
it
was
not
crucial
to
the
board’s
decision
to
determine
whether
the
clause
was
lawful
or
unlawful
because
whether
the
clause
is
lawful
or
unlawful,
you
cannot
use
secondary
pressure
to
implement
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
first
of
all
you
have
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contract
was
meant
to
be
applied
to
a
situation
where
hudik
had
no
control
over
the
work.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
submit
that
it
could
have.
i
want
to
deal
with
two
situations.
in
the
first
place,
if
the
contract
was
not
intended,
prior
to
that
it
covers
finishing
piping
work
on
the
jobsite.
if
it
was
not
intended,
however,
to
apply
to
a
situation,
where
a
sub
did
not
have
control
over
the
work,
obviously
it
would
not,
an
action
would
not
lie
if
one
were
brought,
but
it
could
be
brought.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
and
whether
you
determine
the
legality
of
the
contract
from
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
entered
into
because
8(e)
makes
it
a
violation
to
enter
into
an
illegal
agreement
and
the
mere
fact
the
union
may
unilaterally
later
seek
to
apply
it
to
a
secondary
situation,
does
not
necessarily
make
the
contract
unlawful.
so
you
have
the
initial
question
as
to
whether
the
contract
was
intended
to
cover
a
situation
where
hudik
lost
control.assuming
that
it
did
then
we
get
into
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contract
would
be
said
nonetheless
be
safe
from
illegality
by
the
construction
industry
proviso
to
8(e)
which
privileges
certain
subcontracting
agreements
for
what
would
to
be
done
at
the
jobsite
in
the
building
construction
industry,
even
though
those
contracts
in
other
industries
may
violate
section
8(e),
but
even
those
contracts,
a
legislative
history
makes
clear
cannot
be
enforced
by
restricting
force
and
it
would
violate
8(b)(4),
a
law
suit,
and
the
only
way
that
you
could
enforce
the
contract.
so
if
i
can
sum
up
after
giving,
i
think
too
long
an
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
in
fact
it
is
to
be
determined
that
this
contract
was
intended
to
encompass
a
situation
where
hudik
lost
control
over
the
work,
the
union
maybe
able
to
get
damages
in
a
law
suit,
but
it
could
not
resort
to
economic
pressures
that
would
violate
8(b)(4),
that
is
not
a
question
that
was
before
the
board.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
whatever
it
had,
it
had
–
whether
it
had
negotiated
a
contract
that
would
have
provided
for
in
a
payment
of
damages
or
the
wages
that
would
be
lost
by…
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
even
if
they
did
your
honor,
i
submit
that
they
could
not
use
pressure
that
would
violate
section
8(b)(4)(b),
they
might
only
be
able
to…
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
could
have
put
that
in
the
contract,
but
i
submit
your
honor,
that
congress
nonetheless
as
intended
to
free
him
from
economic
pressure
to
enforce
that
commitment
on
the
same
theory
that
this
court
recognized
in
the
sand
door
case,
that
under
the
47
amendments,
the
inquiry
into
"hot
cargo"
clauses
was
not
illegalized,
but
nonetheless,
the
court
sustained
the
board’s
finding
that
while
congress
permitted
a
voluntary
entry
into
these
agreements
and
permitted
their
enforcements
for
law
suits,
it
drew
the
line
at
using
economic
pressure
to
enforce
them.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
has
not
answered
that
question
your
honor…
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
concluded
that
since
the
only
person
pressured
here
was
hudik,
that
question
was
not
before
that…
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
only
thing
that
woodworking
held
your
honor
as
i
read
it
is
that
you
can
exert
economic
pressure
to
enforce
a
work
preservation
clause
in
a
situation
where
the
employer
has
control
over
the
work.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
austin
would
have
been
with
power
in
the
sense
that
he
was
free
to
have
prescribed
the
other
doors…
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
was
going
back
to
the
original
point
in
time
in
which
he…
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
must
in
view
of
the
footnote
in
the
board’s
opinion
which
is
alluded
to
in
our
brief,
in
which
the,
if
i
may
just
hold
court’s
attention
to,
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
142
(a)
in
which
the
board
says
in
footnote
one,
in
view
of
our
finding
that
responder
(inaudible)
were
undertaken
for
a
secondary
object,
we
find
that
unnecessary
to
pass
upon
the
administrative
law,
judges
finding
that
austin
and
slant/fin
were
primary
employers.
hence
we
are
not
deciding
herein
whether
picketing
or
other
actions
brought
to
bear
directly
against
austin
and
slant/fin
would
constitute
lawful
primary
activity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
only
repeat
myself
when
i
say
that
i
do
not

woodworkers
as
deciding
that
there
is
a
right
to
bring
economic
pressure
to
enforce
a
work
preservation
clause
in
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here.
i
have
also
referred
in
my
brief
to
two
decisions
that
case
some
light
on
this
problem,
but
do
not
directly
answer
it.
there
is
a
case
of
western
monolithics
in
which
the
board
held
prior
to
its
decision
is
this
case,
that
pressure
against
a
general
contractor
would
be
permissible
in
this
type
of
the
situation
and
that
decision
was
the
denied
enforcement
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
subsequent
to
this
decision
is
a
case
called
summit
in
which
the
board
found
that
in
the
circumstances
there,
picketing
of
the
manufacturer
was
not
permissible,
but
in
that
situation
the
manufacturer’s
employees
were
represented
by
another
union
and
the
pressure
against
him
involved
the
violation
of
8(b)(4)(b)
in
that
they
were
seeking
to
enforce
the
reassignment
of
work
from
the
manufacturer’s
employees
to
the
union
employees.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
may
well
depend
upon,
what
it
is
that
the
union
is
seeking,
if
it
is
seeking
to
appeal
to
consumers
not
to
purchase
slant/fin
products,
because
that
diminishes
their
work
opportunities…
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
wish
i
had
a
better
answer
for
you…
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
at
the
time
that
the
specifications
were
drawn
up,
yes…
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
has
been
exactly
the
same
situation
that
frouge
would
have
been
in
national
woodwork.
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
that
would
not
have
given
his
men
any
work,
not
as
a
work
that
they
sought,
whereas
in
frouge’s
case
it
would
have
and
had
austin
prescribed
non-prefabricated
units;
it
would
have…
mr.
norton
j.
come
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
would
have
been
like
the
situation
of
frouge
in
the
national
woodwork.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
