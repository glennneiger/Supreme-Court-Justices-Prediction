justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose,
is
your
position
then
that
even
if
this
particular
subcontractor
had
always
used
prefabricated
doors
and
the
union
was
simply
striking
to
try
to
get
their
own
employee
to
quit
using
prefabricated
doors
and
have
them
constructed
by
them
at
the
jobsite,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
but
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
not
you
arguing
that
under
158(e),
where
a
contract
is
expressly
banned
or
accepted
it,
if
then
does
it
cover
a
situation
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
the
congress
expressly
permits
this
kind
of
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
does
not
suggest
that
this
agreement
in
this
case
is
illegal.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
it
is
not
enforceable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
â€“
could
you
enforce
it
in
a
301
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
think,
it
maybe
you
do
just
come
out
and
say
that
because
congress
has
expressed
approval
of
a
contract
like
this
and
because
it
is
expressed
provision
in
301,
in
301
actions
you
can
enforce
a
contract
that
this
provision,
this
construction
of
the
board
is
just
simply
contrary
to
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
want
to
win
more
than
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
us
just
assume
the
question
was,
does
the
construction
industry
proviso
cover
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
enterprise
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
it
involves
a
labor
dispute
arising
out
of
the
refusal
of
certain
unionized
steel
cutters
to
install
pre-fitted
and
pre-piped
air-conditioning
units
at
a
construction
site.
the
steam
fitters
claimed
that
the
--
that
the
use
of
these
of
air
conditioners
violated
a
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
work
stoppage
was
a
secondary
boycott
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
8(b)
--
4(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
national
labor
relations
board
held
that
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
court
of
appeal
disagreed
and
set
aside
the
order
because
we
agree
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
rather
than
the
court
of
appeals
will
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan
joined
by
mr.
justice
marshall
had
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
opinion
is
also
adjoined
in
substantial
part
by
mr.
justice
stewart
who
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
