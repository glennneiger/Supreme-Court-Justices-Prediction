ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
number
of
legal
and
factual
questions,
some
are
technical
or
complex.
the
petitioners
strenuously
argue
these
complicated
points
and
try
to
obscure
the
basic
nature
of
this
case
in
approaching
the
difficult
questions.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
i
didn't
know
this
is
possible,
your
honor.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
is
that
better?
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
thank
you.
in
approaching
these
difficult
questions
however,
i
would
urge
the
court,
not
to
lose
sight
of
two
simple
facts.
the
first
one
is
that
the
record
shows
that
east
texas
motor
freight
is
a
blatantly
discriminatory
employer
and
the
east
texas
motor
freight
is
joined
by
the
union
petitioners
in
seeking
to
perpetuate
the
effects
of
their
traditional
and
nationwide
commitment
to
employment
discrimination.
petitioner's
arguments
boil
down
to
a
salvo
of
complicated
legal
reasons
for
denying
through
their
mexican-american
and
black
employees
and
members,
what
this
court
said
in
albemarle
paper
company
and
franks
v.
bowman
was
due
them,
complete
relief,
from
petitioner's
employment
discrimination.
in
my
argument,
i
wish
to
focus
on
the
three
of
the
reasons
advanced
by
petitioners.
one,
that
this
was
not
a
proper
transaction.
second
that
we
did
not
prove
a
prima
facie
class
case,
and
third,
that
the
no-transfer
rule
and
seniority
system
of
petitioners
did
not
violate
the
law.
because
the
petitioners
have
understated
the
extent
of
employment,
discrimination
shown
on
the
record,
i
would
briefly
highlight
that
evidence.
east
texas
motor
freight
had
never
employed
a
mexican-american
or
a
black
road
driver
in
the
southern
conference
in
texas
until
mr.
rodriguez
filed
his
eeoc
charge
in
1970.
east
texas
stipulated
in
the
government
suit
that
as
late
as
june
1972,
the
company
had
no
black
road
drivers
anywhere,
and
only
eight,
mexican-american
road
drivers
among
its
approximately
180
road
driver
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
workforce.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
i'm
speaking
of
the
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
the
southern
conference,
yes.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
only
as
it
relates
to
the
states
of
texas,
we
saw
the
class
that
would
cover
the
employees
in
the
--
in
fact
we
saw
the
class
covering
applicants
and
employees
in
the
state
of
texas,
the
class
was
narrowed
by
the
fifth
circuit
to
city
driver,
black
and
mexican-american
city
drivers.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
i
think
the
statistic
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
i'm
sorry.
i
think
it's
--
the
statistic
is
very
relevant
because
we're
talking
about
the
same
company,
east
texas
motor
freight
and
its
employment
pattern
in
the
state
of
texas.
we're
are
also
talking
about
the
union
defendant,
so
we
have
here
two
union
defendants,
the
southern
conference
and
all
of
its
members
within
the
state
of
texas,
and
also,
the
local
union
which
our
three,
named
plaintiffs,
were
a
member
of.
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
of
the
eight
mexican-american
road
drivers
that
east
texas
motor
freight
had
in
1972,
it
had
itself,
hired
only
three
of
them,
the
rest
that
had
acquired
through
(inaudible)
the
terminal
by
terminal
statewide
and
southern
conference
employment
figures
make
it
crystal
clear
that
race
was
a
constant
and
pervasive
factor
in
staffing
etmf's
truck
driver
jobs.
in
el
paso,
for
example,
all
city
drivers
were
minorities
but
road
driver
jobs
were
reserved
for
whites.
in
forth
worth,
with
no
road
driver
domiciled,
all
35
city
drivers
were
anglo.
in
pecos,
with
no
city
drivers,
all
16
road
drivers
were
anglo
and
superimposed
on
these
statistics,
were
two
policies
which
operated
to
lock
in
all
of
the
minority
city
drivers
into
the
city
positions.
these
were,
of
course,
etmf's
no-transfer
rule,
which
prohibited
transfer
from
city
to
road
position
and
further
which
prohibited
transfer
between
terminals.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
yes,
there's
a
company
rule,
your
honor.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
they
did
not.
however,
their
role
came
in
through
the
collect
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
yes.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
but
the
--
my
other
point
is
that
the
other
one
is
the
petitioner's
seniority
system
under
the
union
contracts
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
that
is
precisely
the
thrust
of
our
complaint.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
because,
your
honor,
in
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
pardon
me?
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
yes,
i
understand
that.
however,
the
impact
of
that
facially
neutral
rule
is
on
minorities
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
because
whites
could
always
get
the
road
driver
jobs
at
other
terminals.
in
fact,
all
180
road
driver
jobs
were
held
by
white
males,
that
might
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
not
a
one
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
there
were
no
jobs
in
san
antonio.
however,
our
three,
named
plaintiffs
were
willing
to
move.
they
further
were
willing,
at
an
early
point,
to
give
up
their
seniority
to
move
but
the
system
operated
to
lock
them
into
the
city
driver
positions
in
san
antonio
terminal.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
it
locked
them
in
because
the
company
said,
“you
may
not
transfer
between
terminals.”
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
and
then
the
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
union
said.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
and
then
the
union
said,
“but
if
you
do
transfer,
you
may
not
carry
over
your
unit
seniority
which
you
have
earned
only
in
the
city
driver
unit.”
needless
to
say
that
would
be
a
substantial
--b
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
impediment.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
but
in
striking
down,
hopefully
that
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
yes,
and
that
rule
was
challenged
and
not
only
the
no-transfer
rule
but
the
subsequent
in
followup
impact
of
the
now-operative
collective
bargaining
agreement
if
there
is
a
successful
challenge
to
the
company's
no-transfer
rule.
there
is,
furthermore,
additional
proof
of
discrimination
in
this
record.
contrary
to
the
assertions
of
east
texas
motor
freight
that
it
applies
equally
and
especially
neutral
driving
standards,
etmf
has
often
treated
its
minority
and
anglo
employees
differently
by
not
requiring
all
anglo
drivers
to
meet
those
standards.
in
analyzing
the
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
is
an
anglo.
yes,
that's
how
we
define
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
probably
not.
that
would
be
another
minority.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
a
non-minority.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
yes.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
commonly
in
the
south
west,
one
does
use
the
term
anglo
which
is
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
even,
yes.
there
are
some
inaccuracies
that
have
built
up
over
the
years
but
we
all
recognize
each
other.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
in
analyzing
the
applications
of
52
road
drivers
who
were
either
employed
as
new
road
drivers
that
transferred
from
the
city
to
the
road
by
east
texas
motor
freight
between
1970
and
1972,
twelve
did
not
meet
a
stated
requirement
for
the
road
position
which
was
a
high
school
diploma
or
its
equivalency.
the
names
of
these
individuals
are
found
at
page
181
of
the
appendix.
further,
a
high
company
official
testified
that
east
texas
relies
very
heavily
on
referrals
by
incumbent
employees
as
the
source
of
applicants.
the
incumbents,
of
course,
are
anglo.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
we
did
not
get
into
in
this
record,
at
the
class
of
applicants
and
that's
why
the
fifth
circuit
said
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
no,
it's
about
the
inability
of
minority
city
road
--
city
drivers
existing
employees
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
to
transfer
and
carry
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
over
the
seniority.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
our
three,
named
plaintiffs.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
they
applied?
they
applied,
they
requested
--
they
applied
orally
since
1965
and
then
they
applied
in
writing
in
1970.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
that
is
all
that
we
have
in
the
record
in
terms
of
applications.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
no.
we
contend
that
in
facts
such
as
these.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
city
driver.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
contend
that
in
the
initial
stage
of
establishing
a
prima
facie
case,
establishing
a
class
action.
all
we
need
to
do
is
identify
certainly
in
this
pattern,
on
these
statistics
and
with
these
policies
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
yes,
my
idea
of
the
class
consists
of
--
of
employees,
mexican-american
and
black
employees
who
are
city
drivers.
we
leave
it
to
the
later
stage
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
the
remedy
stage
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
are
in
the
class.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
whether
they
qualify
for
relief,
of
course,
is
a
different
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
matter.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
that's
right,
but
certainly
all
of
them
who
wanted
to
transfer
were
affected
by
the
policies
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
which
we
attack
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
in
the
clause.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
approximately
200
city
drivers
in
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
no,
that
has
not
yet
been
established.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
we
haven't
yet
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
because
certainly
they
were
all
affected
by
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
the
policies.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
it's
hard
at
this
first
stage
proceeding,
your
honor,
to
identify
those
class
members
who
in
fact
wanted
to
transfer
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
the
common
grievance
here,
certainly,
was
the
--
the
system
involved
here.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
no-transfer
rule
and
the
statistics
which
showed
that
road
driving
jobs
were
for
anglo
males.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
and
the
no-transfer
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
as
i
have
said
to,
mr.
justice
marshall,
certainly
our
three,
named
plaintiffs
indicate
that
they
were
willing
to
move
at
the
--
at
an
early
stage
in
their
application.
they
were
willing
to
give
up
their
seniority,
but
it
would
be
very
difficult
in
this
factual
context
with
the
company
having
a
no-transfer
rule,
to
look
for
applications
because
of
the
no-transfer
rule.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
they
are
members
of
the
class.
there
are,
conceivably,
other
members
in
the
class
who
were
similarly
situated
and
in
fact
they
were
--
there
were
other
people
who
testified
at
trial.
the
subpoena
of
gomez,
for
example,
also
said
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
that
he
had
wanted
to
apply.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
they
--
in
that
they
--
they
were
properly
not
be
coming
forward
at
the
remedy
stage
where
we
will
be
attempting
to
identify
those
people
who
did
in
fact
want
to
transfer
to
these
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
these
jobs.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
the
answer
could
well
be
at
that
--
what
we
would
do
then
is
to
say
the
class
will
consist
of
people
who
in
fact
wanted
to
transfer.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
who
wanted
to
transfer
even
though
they
might
not
have
actually
applied
because
of
these
hurdles.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
who
wanted
and
or
now
want
to
transfer?
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
that's
our
class.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
as
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
the
same
standards
that
have
been
used
to
evaluate
the
qualifications
of
anglos
were
not
used
in
evaluating
the
qualifications
of
the
named
plaintiffs.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
i
think
the
record
is
not
complete,
could
not
--
is
not
complete
in
that
respect
but
certainly
it
does
show
that
the
same
standards
were
not
being
used
by
this
company
and
further
the
record
shows
that
the
company
had
stipulated
that
it
itself
had
never
even
considered
the
applications
of
these
individual
plaintiffs
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
meaning
of
that
stipulation
that
mr.
hotvedt
relies
on
to
say
that
we
gave
up,
the
class
action
on
the
eve
of
trial.
that
stipulation
went
to,
what
was
the
standard
to
be
used
by
the
court
to
determine
if
there
had
been
discrimination
against
the
individual
plaintiffs.
we
contended
that
the
discrimination
consisted
of
not
considering
their
applications.
further,
by
a
separate
stipulation,
the
company
stipulated,
it's
true
we
have
not
considered
their
applications.
the
record
which
the
company
then
came
in
with
was
a
record
which
they
compiled
after
the
charge,
these
eeoc
charges
had
been
filed
and
they
used
that
record
to
say,
now
we
--
you
know,
looking
it
over,
we
contend
they
are
not
qualified.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
i
--
we
contend
that
the
reason
was
certainly
the
no-transfer
rule
but
also
the
fact
that
road
driver
jobs
were
limited
to
anglo
males.
again,
in
remembering
what
was
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
in
over-the-road
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
jobs
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
precisely,
and
of
course
we
were
hired
here
at
plaintiffs
work
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
due
to
city
jobs
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
into
city
jobs.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
we
were
complaining
about
the
inability
to
go
into
the
road
jobs
and
again
understanding
what
was
in
this
record.
i
think
it's
important
to
see
what
sorts
of
responses
the
plaintiffs
were
getting
when
they
indicated
very
early
a
desire
for
the
more
lucrative
and
desirable
road
jobs
to
oral
request
for
transfers.
the
plaintiffs
received
noncommittal
responses
from
company
and
union
officials
that
they
would
look
into
it,
that
the
no-transfer
rule
precluded
such
a
transfer.
one
of
them
even
said
that
road
jobs
were
not
for
mexican-americans,
that
the
equipment
was
too
expensive
for
mexican-americans
to
be
driving
it.
when
the
plaintiff
perez
learned
from
east
texas
motor
freights
new
terminal
manager
that
there
were
road
openings
in
san
angelo,
he
sought
the
assistant
of
the
union
president
in
getting
that
job.
the
response
of
the
union
president
was
to
go
to
the
manager's
superior
and
ask
that
superior
to
tell
the
new
manger
to
quit
giving
out
this
type
of
information.
and
then
the
response
to
the
filing
of
the
eeoc
charges
was
to
invite
the
plaintiffs
to
file
written
applications
which
they
themselves
stipulated,
they
then
ignored
and
were
not
even
forwarded
to
the
dallas
office
which
does
the
main
hiring.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
yes,
it
does
and
at
least
one
them
testified
that
he
would
have
given
up
his
seniority.
another
one,
mr.
herrera,
testified
that
earlier,
yes,
he
would
given
up
his
seniority
but
now
that
he
was
older,
he
saw
that
as
far
more
of
an
impediment.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
no,
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
they
did
so
advise
company
officials
and
the
union
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
--
and
the
union
official
as
well.
since
the
filing
of
the
eeoc
charges
and
the
complaint
in
the
suit,
all
three,
named
plaintiffs
had
been
discharged
--
have
been
discharged.
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
mr.
rodriguez
had
worked
for
east
texas
motor
freight
six
years,
mr.
perez,
twelve,
mr.
herrera,
six.
again,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
this
was
a
proper
class
action
and
the
firth
circuit
so
held.
their
work,
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
allegations
in
the
complaint,
in
the
pretrial
order
in
the
colloquy
at
--
with
plaintiffs'
counsel
at
the
trial.
further,
the
nature
of
the
plaintiffs
claims
themselves,
bespeak
a
need
for
a
class
action
look
at
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
being
complained
about.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
the
initial
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
initially,
that
argues
that
but
the
record,
you
know,
doesn't
end
there.
there
is
in
the
record,
a
substantial
evidence
which
showed
how
these
systems
operate,
what
the
statistics
were?
what
the
experience
of
the
plaintiffs
were
in
trying
to
get
the
road
driver
jobs
et
cetera.
we
contend
that
that
was
sufficient
to
show
that
there
was
a
proper
class
action
which
did
comply
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
rule
23
(a)
and
23
(b)(2).
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
some
were
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
some
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
some
were
and
some
were
not
willing
to
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
of
the
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
of
the
individual
named
plaintiffs.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
that
is
right,
but
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
i
--
i
can't
remember.
i
think
it
was,
mr.
perez
who
had
said
that
he
would
be
willing
to
resign.
mr.
herrera
indicated
that
he
might
have
earlier,
but
now
he,
you
know
--
it
was
too
late
and
he
needed
the
seniority
that
he
had
as
a
city
driver
in
san
antonio.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
initially,
you
understand
they've
been
making
these
applications
orally
in
the
1960's
(voice
overlap)
and
inviting
that
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
the
application
as
i
recall
it
was
that
they
were
willing
to
resign
with
--
without
seniority.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
they
made
that
offer
but
the
company
said
to
them
that
they
still
couldn't
transfer
and
they
did
not
accept
their
application.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
company
took
these
letters
which
are
set
out
at
pages
324
through
326
of
the
appendix
and
basically
filed
them
away.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
i
think
we
have
both,
your
honor,
and
of
course
i
don't
--
i
think
we
have
both.
mr.
herrera
certainly
indicated
that
at
the
time
of
trial,
he
indicated
that
he
was
not
willing
to
give
up
his
seniority.
he
was
earlier,
but
not
at
the
time
of
trial.
so
that
certainly
he
raises
it
and
of
course
we
only
need
one
person
to
bring
a
class
action,
and
we
don't
have
to
have
that
person
prevail
necessarily
as,
your
honor
knows,
to
proceed
with
a
proper
class
action
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
i
think
we
have
that.
it
was
our
named
plaintiff,
mr.
herrara.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
your
honor,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
we
find
that
that
system
is
discriminatory,
and
we
contend
that
it
is,
and
in
fact,
the
fifth
circuit
so
held.
why
should
we
penalize
people,
who
many
years
ago,
when
they
were
first
trying
to
transfer
to
those
jobs,
weren't
able
to.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
of
course,
the
bottom
line
problem
here,
your
honor,
is
that
none
of
them
was
permitted
to
transfer
because
of
the
no-transfer
rule.
they
just,
basically,
let
them
file
these
applications
and
then
did
not
consider
them.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
i
think
it
also
is
worth
noting
that
the
letters
which
i've
described
to
you
is,
in
our
appendix,
were
written
by
the
company
for
the
plaintiffs
and
they
were
just
making
every
effort
they
possibly
could,
to
get
those
jobs
which
they
so
badly
wanted.
even
with
those
concessions,
the
company
refused
their
application.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
sir?
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
well,
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
certainly
had
before
it
an
adequate
record
on
which
it
made
its
findings.
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
remand,
of
course,
for
determination
of
--
of
the
size
of
the
class.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
as
i've
said
earlier,
your
honor,
that
stipulation
was
meant
to
define
what
was
the
standard
to
be
used
by
the
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
discrimination
against
the
named
plaintiffs.
in
other
words,
was
the
failure
to
consider
their
applications
discriminatory?
that
was
the
clear
thrust
of
the
stipulation.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
it
did
not
address
the
class
section
issue.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
it
--
i
think
the
--
the
other
possibility
for
that
would
be
that
at
that
time
they
were
proceeding
only
as
to
the
individual
plaintiffs.
however,
i
think
that
the
record
shows
that
in
fact,
it
was
tried
as
a
class
action.
as
you
know,
it's
quite
--
well,
it's
quite
common
to
proceed
in
a
bifurcated
proceeding
where
you
establish
the
class
first
--
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
true.
ms.
vilma
s.
martinez
thank
you.
