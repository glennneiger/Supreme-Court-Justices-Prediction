now,
did
--
did
san
antonio
have
road
drivers?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
nearest
terminal
that
had
over-the-road
drivers?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
claim
of
any
discrimination
in
their
original
hiring.
and,
well,
if
you're
right
that
these
were
--
if
they
were
hired
on
their
first
application,
they
couldn't
have
been.
justice
potter
stewart
703
(j)
in
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
reprinted
here
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
employees
you
represented
were
all
city
drivers
or
other
city
employees.
justice
potter
stewart
not
as
domicile
within
your
geographical
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
some
drive
through
it
and
the
--
the
local
to
which
they
belong
would
depend
upon
where
they're
domiciled.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
company
had
a
no-transfer
rule
on
every
terminal,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
i
want
to
be
sure
what
i
understand.
you,
too,
have
made
by
way
of
a
concession
when
you
began.
you
can
see
that
you
could
been
in
here,
the
so-called
rule
19
defendant
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
the
purpose
of
according
adequate
relief
to
the
plaintiffs.
justice
potter
stewart
and
assuming
employer
discrimination
where
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
will
be
found.
justice
potter
stewart
what
could
you
have
as
a
rule
19
defendant
then,
ordered
to
do
or
not
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
envision
its
rightful
place
relief
in
this
context?
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
ceratin
--
at
a
certain
date
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
a
certain
--
at
a
certain
time.
and
then
his
seniority
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
over-the-road
local
would
date
from
that
time.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
qualified.
there
was
a
vacancy
and
he
did
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
--
or
shows
that
he
absolutely
would
have
made
an
application
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
it
not
been
for
racial
discrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that's
a
company
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
the
union
had
no
part
of
that
rule
though?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
you're
going
to
do
the
other
two
points
now?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
not
one,
but
not
a
none
in
san
antonio.
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
were
no
jobs.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
is
that?
how
did
it
lock
them
in?
justice
potter
stewart
whatever,
that's
the
company,
not
the
union.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
collective
bargaining
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
ut
the
‘if'
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
‘if'
never
came
--
it
never
came
into
operation.
if
there
were
no
transfers
for
anybody
from
city
to
over-the-road
drivers,
then
the
seniority
provisions
never
had
any
effect.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
have
had
effect
only
if
there
had
been
transfers,
and
there
were
no
transfers
in
this
company,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
define
anglo?
as
--as
anybody
who's
not
a
spanish
surname
and
not
a
negro?
justice
potter
stewart
would
an
american-indian
be
an
anglo?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
it
by
a
process
of
exclusion
about
this.
then
what's
left
are
anglos?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
they
might
be
polish?
justice
potter
stewart
who
wanted
to
transfer?
justice
potter
stewart
generally
a
class
is
a
--
if
i
can
think
by
allowing
that
is
it
consist
of
people
who
have
--
who
have
a
grievance
of
some
kind.
and
people
who
never
wanted
to
transfer
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
weren't
qualified,
never
thought
of
it,
never
wanted
to,
would
have
no
grievance
whatsoever,
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
how
could
a
class
include
all
the
city
employees,
even
though
it
was
described
by
my
brother,
marshall?
justice
potter
stewart
how?
justice
potter
stewart
how?
if
they'd
never
have
any
idea
of
wanting
to
transfer,
how
possibly
were
they
affected
by
that
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
generally,
definition
of
a
class,
is
a
group
of
people
who
have
one
thing
in
common,
at
least,
and
that
is
that
they
have
a
common
grievance
of
some
kind?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
but
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
get
the
remedy,
you've
passed
liability
and
you
have
found
that
the
company
you
hope
to
--
will
have
proof
that
that
stated
a
company
has
violated
the
act
with
respect
to
every
single
member
of
the
class.
now,
that
--
that
isn't
--
that
won't
quite
be
true
will
it,
if
there
were
--
if
some
of
the
city
drivers
never
wanted
to
transfer
and
will
get
very
angry
if
somebody
suggested
if
they
would
--
if
would
transfer.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
--
now
we're
getting
the
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
--
so
--
so
let's
say
--
let's
ask
again,
what
is
the
class?
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
what
your
class
was.
now
--
now
have
you
changed,
just
--
just
the
city
drivers
who
want
to
transfer?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
the
class?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
sir.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
were
also
limited
to
original
hire
in
over-the-road
jobs,
weren't
they?
it's
to
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
given
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
no-transfer
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
hired
at
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
san
antonio.
justice
potter
stewart
to
city
jobs
that
the
only
jobs
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
ms.
martinez,
does
the
record
tell
us
whether
the
three,
named
plaintiffs
would
have
taken
over-the-road
jobs
if
--
and
--
and
given
up
their
seniority?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
should
refine
the
question
a
little
bit.
does
the
record
show
whether
the
named
plaintiffs
so
advised
the
company,
or
did
they
just
ask
for
a
transfer
with
both
seniority?
justice
potter
stewart
that
they're
willing
to
surrender
seniority
if
they
could
get
the
road
job?
justice
potter
stewart
ms.
martinez,
it
occurs
to
me
that
neither
of
the
two
issues
that
judge
wisdom
identifies
that
the
beginning
of
his
opinion
is
really
raised
by
these
plaintiffs
because
used
--
the
first
issue
was
to
challenge
the
requirement
that
they
resign
their
jobs
in
order
to
get
a
road
drive
job
and
you
say
that
they
indicated
they're
willing
to
that,
so
the
--
that
rule
wasn't
an
obstacle.
and
the
second
was
they
lose
--
lose
seniority
and
you
said,
they're
willing
to
do
that
too?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
these
people
don't
raise
the
issues
the
court
discusses?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
--
what's
wrong
with
that
--
what's
wrong
with
my
understanding
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
these
three.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
the
three,
named
plaintiffs?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
see.
so,
some
were
willing
that
to
--
to
resign
and
others
were
not,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
would
--
would
you
identify
them
so
--
so
i
know
which
they
were
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
thought
you
told
me
that
they
--
all
three
had
advised
the
company
that
they
were
willing
to
resign?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
to
the
question
that's
exactly,
what
was
the
application?
was
it,
i
want
to
transfer
with
seniority
or
i'm
willing
to
resign
and
take
the
new
job
if
they'll
give
it
to
me?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that's
their
case,
they
don't
raise
this
basic
issue
that
judge
wisdom
spends
so
much
time
talking
about?
it
--
maybe
i
missed
something
here.
i
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
it
seems
to
me
is,
you
have
a
--
the
simple
case
of
out
and
out
discrimination
against
three
people
rather
than
a
class
case
involving
the
validities
of
these
rules
if
i
understand
the
facts
here.
