mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
speak
for
east
texas
motor
freight,
which
was
charged
with
violating
the
civil
rights
act,
for
refusing
to
transfer
three
mexican-americans
from
city
driving
jobs
they
held
in
san
antonio
to
road
jobs
in
some
other
city.
plaintiffs
originally
sought
class
relief
as
well.
but
as
we
shall
discuss
later,
the
trial
and
record
really
developed
as
a
suit
by
three
individuals.
the
defendants
were
acquitted
securing
a
dismissal
after
trial
of
all
charges.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed,
deciding
that
it
could
determine
from
its
level
that
the
matter
warranted
class
treatment.
it
set
the
classes
and
remanded
for
remedies.
i
should
say
it
found
liability
to
them
as
well
and
remanded
for
remedies.
we
seek
reversal
of
that
fifth
circuit
decision,
restoration
of
the
district
court
judgment
or
at
least
a
remand
for
a
proper
class
determination
by
the
district
court.
in
the
event
the
district
court
should
certify
a
class
for
some
trial
on
liability,
we
seek
guidance
on
the
use
of
racial
statistics
as
an
evidentiary
device.
a
brief
statement
of
our
special
facts
is
in
order
because
of
the
regrettable
tendency
of
the
appellate
court
to
treat
all
title
vii
and
trucking
industry
cases
alike.
we
think
we
have
unique
facts
in
this
case,
which
we
should
like
to
tell,
not
only
to
secure
justice
for
ourselves,
but
also
to
put
some
rational
bounds
on
the
generalizations
that
have
come
to
dominate
title
vii
litigation.
the
company
is
a
common
carrier
with
many
terminals
stretching
across
the
country.
at
some
of
those
terminals,
it
has
both
city
drivers
and
road
drivers.
at
other
terminals,
it
only
has
city
jobs
available.
mr.
rodriguez,
mr.
herrera
and
mr.
perez
were
city
drivers
in
san
antonio
who
applied
for
transfer
to
a
road
job
in
1970.
when
their
applications
were
not
considered,
they
attacked
the
transfer
denial
as
a
violation,
arguing
that
the
company's
localized
hiring
practice
and
rule
against
city
to
road
transfer,
as
well
as
the
contract
seniority
system
were
facially
neutral
policies
that
locked
them
in
to
lesser
jobs.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
it
did
not,
your
honor.
there
is
evidence
that
upon
the
acquisition
of
a
predecessor
company
with
--
that
company
had
one
driver
domiciled
at
that
point
because
of
the
way
its
system
fit,
but
that
ceased
to
be
the
practice
and
that
was
unexceptional
in
this
record
as
far
as
all
parties
were
concerned.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
i
think
it
was
about
240
miles
away
elsewhere
in
texas.
but
i
--
i'm
at
a
loss
to
know
in
which
direction.
i
think
it
was
to
the
north
of
(inaudible).
the
key
fact
here
is
that
when
plaintiffs
originally
applied
for
jobs,
they
did
so
in
a
place
where
there
were
no
road
jobs.
they
asked
for
and
got
the
only
job
that
the
company
had
to
offer
in
san
antonio.
and
we
think
that
these
facts
distinguished
this
case,
from
franks
against
bowman
and
the
similar
seniority
cases
with
which
this
court
is
familiar.
plaintiffs
complained
of
civil
rights
violations
as
to
themselves
and
a
class
of
mexican-americans
and
blacks.
all
defendants
opposed
the
claim
for
class
relief
in
their
answers.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
and
not
only
that,
your
honor,
but
at
the
trial,
plaintiffs
stipulated
that
they
had
not
been
discriminated
against
when
they
were
hired
at
san
antonio.
plaintiffs
did
not
move
for
a
class
certification.
no
court-managed
pretrial
conference
occurred.
on
the
morning
of
the
trial,
the
parties
reached
case-narrowing
stipulations,
the
most
important
of
which
was,
and
i
quote,
“the
only
issue
presently
before
the
court
pertaining
to
the
company
is
whether
its
failure
to
consider
plaintiffs'
application
violated
title
vii
and
section
1981.
so,
the
trial
went
on.
the
ruling
rejecting
any
class
status
came
in
the
post-trial
findings.
during
trial,
a
colloquy
among
court
and
counsel
showed
opposition
to
and
doubt
about
whether
this
was
being
tried
as
a
class
action.
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
district
court's
findings
of
non-discrimination
as
to
the
named
plaintiffs
and
lack
of
personal
qualifications
were
reversed.
we
ask
for
restoration
of
judge
woods'
judgment,
to
be
sure.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
we
emphasize
the
second
point,
your
honor.
that
is,
the
--
and
--
and
it
is
precisely
the
first
point
of
argument
we
have
here.
the
fundamental
error
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
our
opinion
was
its
disbelief
that
the
plaintiffs
had
abandoned
or
waived
the
class
action
aspects
of
it.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
well,
your
honor,
it's
our
view
that
the
--
that
the
burden
for
moving
under
rule
23
to
clear
up
the
confusion
in
cases
of
this
kind,
should
very
well
be
placed
upon
plaintiffs
whose
responsibility
it
is
to
fulfill
the
internal
elements
of
the
rule
as
well.
we
point
out
that
in
this
record,
we
had
the
cumulative
development
of
no
movement
for
class
certification
by
the
plaintiff,
the
stipulation
i
have
referred
to
and
then
the
form
of
a
trial
which
concentrated
upon
the
individual
issues.
and
we
think
that
for
these
reasons,
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
judge
was
correct.
and
more
important
from
our
standpoint,
we
had
reason
to
rely
upon
it
being
tried
as
an
individual
action,
and
we
think
it
was
error
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
disbelieve
that
it
was
tried
as
an
individual
action.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
indeed.
even
if
--
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
they
didn't
--
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
we
did
not.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
even
the
plaintiffs,
when
they
approached
the
briefing
to
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
i
quote,
“the
class
action
question
has
never
been
considered
by
the
lower
court.”
when
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
the
determination
that
the
plaintiffs
had
not
abandoned
the
class
issue,
looking
at
the
state
of
confusion
in
the
colloquy
in
the
record
and
the
--
the
different
views
on
this
point,
the
wise
thing
to
do,
the
correct
thing
to
do
would
have
been
to
remand
for
a
fresh
determination
on
that
point.
in
fact,
for
the
first
determination
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
well,
is
that
--
for
the
reasons,
i
ask
--
answer
to
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
if
we
had
been
assaulted
frontally
--
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
--
with
a
--
with
a
pattern
and
practice
type
of
case
or
with
a
broad
class
type
of
case,
one
brings
to
bear
the
kind
of
statistical
and
--
and
expert
evidence,
it
goes
to
the
depth
and
breadth
of
one's
trial
preparation
and
--
and
the
extent
to
which
one
goes
in
handling
the
argument,
your
honor.
but
my
point
is
not
that
this
record
is
ready
to
demonstrate,
we
could
have
satisfied
such
a
case.
my
point
is,
we
deserve
the
fresh
chance
to
counter
such
an
approach.
we
--
one
of
the
points
that
the
fifth
circuit
made
in
--
in
saying
that
it's
of
little
mind
that
rule
23
is
being
decided
at
this
level
rather
than
at
the
district
court
level,
was
that,
one
should
take
a
liberal
approach
to
the
interpretation
of
title
vii
or
of
rule
23
in
title
vii
cases.
that
expression
about
liberality
in
the
interpretation
of
rule
23
is
all
right
as
far
as
it
goes.
but
i
think
it
arose,
at
first,
in
the
context
of
title
vii,
when
defendant
employers
in
the
early
1960s
or
mid
1960s
were
saying,
“no
classes
should
arise
in
title
vii
cases.”
and
so,
the
dictum
arose
that
--
that
these
are
inherent
class
cases
or
these
relief
is
inherently
class
relief.
but
that's
what
it
is,
a
generalization
or
a
dictum.
what
we're
faced
with
today
arising
from
at
least
this
court
of
appeals
is
the
notion
that
rule
23
in
title
vii
cases
contains
within
it
some
mandate
for
an
automatic
result
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
on
the
class
issue.
and
that's
the
extreme
we
call
into
question.
we
think
it
was
also
especially
erroneous
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
set
the
classes
at
its
level
rather
than
remanding
to
the
district
court.
in
the
light
of
what
it
then
knew
to
be
the
fact,
the
development
of
a
major
consent
decree
reached
following
a
707
action
brought
by
the
justice
department
against
our
client,
east
texas
motor
freight.
and
before
the
case
was
argued
in
the
fifth
circuit,
before
it
decided,
it
knew
that
massive
relief
had
been
granted,
monetary,
seniority,
alteration
of
qualification
rules,
et
cetera.
it
arrived
on
the
seen
at
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
a
position
to
look
at
the
issues
extant
in
the
rodriguez
case
and
offered
yet
another
reason
against
the
background
of
the
confusion
i
referred
to
earlier.
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
sent
it
back
to
where
it
belonged
for
the
proper
determination
of
a
class
issue
for
the
informed
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
developing
a
record
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
we
certainly
would,
but
it
would
much
depend
on
the
shape
of
the
class,
your
honor.
for
example,
the
consent
decree
has
overlapping
reaches
down
into
the
group
that
arises
in
san
antonio.
we
may
very
well
have
arguments
that
the
class
should
be
so
narrow
to
one
terminal
or
just
a
few
terminals
or
to
just
a
limited
number
of
persons
in
the
light
of
what
justice
was
secured
under
the
auspices
of
judge
sarah
hughes
in
--
in
dallas
when
we
reached
the
consent
decree.
we
would
further
find
that
in
its
application
internally
of
rule
23,
the
fifth
circuit
erred
by
its
somewhat
cavalier
approach
to
how
you
go
about
satisfying
the
internal
elements.
i
won't
dwell
on
that.
we
briefed
it
extensively.
we
would
simply
state
that
we
think
it
unfair
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that
there
is
no
serious
challenge
that
the
internal
elements
of
rule
23
(a)
have
been
satisfied.
that
hasn't
even
been
the
focus
yet.
we
think
that
plaintiffs,
even
in
a
title
vii
case,
should
be
put
to
the
test
of
those
rules
and
if
we
get
a
class
action
determination,
we're
prepared
to
challenge
commonality,
typicality.
indeed,
adequacy
of
representation
has
not
been
aired.
and
it's
interesting
that
we
have
here,
for
example,
the
implications
of
severe
questions
about
commonality
and
typicality
and
adequacy
of
representation
arising
from
within
facts
where
you
have
people
of
different
kinds
of
ethnic
discrimination
being
claimed
with
mexican-americans
borrowing
statistics
from
blacks
with
people
from
san
antonio
with
no
road
jobs
being
represented
by
counsel
with
aspirations
to
speak
for
people
at
domicile
terminals.
the
implications
of
need
for
such
an
airing
of
those
issues
are
pretty
clear,
we
think,
on
the
remand.
we
turn
now
to
the
proof
of
liability
issue.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
establishing
the
components
of
a
prima
facie
case
in
class
actions
under
title
vii
by
the
sweeping
assumption
that
statistical
differences
between
work
force
and
population,
standing
alone,
are
sufficient
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
preliminary
here,
we
would
note
the
government
position
which
arrives
in
recent
weeks
and
where
we
note
that
it
--
it
urges
a
remand
for
a
new
trial
on
the
issue
of
liability,
saying
that
the
fifth
circuit
erred
by
determining
liability
to
a
class
and
they
concede
that
this
could
have
been
premature
and
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
employer
with
no
fair
change
to
contest
liability
on
a
class
scale.
it's
a
welcome
concession.
we
think
it
carries
within
it
the
logical
implication
that
we
were
similarly
disadvantaged
on
the
class
issue,
but
we
--
we're
prepared
to
receive
at
any
terms.
as
the
proof
of
discrimination,
based
on
statistics
alone
are,
at
least,
sufficient
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
we
recognize
that
proof
of
discrimination
seldom
comes
in
quotable
form.
one
has
to
search
for
circumstantial
evidence,
expressions,
remarks,
conduct,
inconsistent
behavior
and
indeed
statistics.
but
what
we
are
seeing
now
is
the
statement
that
a
raw
numerical
disparity
over
a
broad
geographical
area
between
population
statistics
and
the
employer's
workforce
constitutes
that
element
of
proof
which
will
shift
the
burden,
from
the
plaintiff
to
the
defendant,
and
in
a
court,
such
as
the
fifth
circuit,
put
the
employer
in
a
hole
from
which
it
is
very
difficult
to
extricate
himself.
we
think
it
especially
ironic
that
this
reliance
on
such
undifferentiated
statistics
should
arise
under
a
statute
which
contains
the
congressional
caution
of
section
703
(j).
we're
not
suggesting
that
that
section
prohibits
the
use
of
statistics
at
all,
but
when
the
congress
goes
to
the
trouble
of
suggesting
that
one
should
not
create
special
favor
for
a
particular
ethnic
or
racial
type
because
of
a
statistical
imbalance,
one
thinks
then
that
the
development
of
evidentiary
rules
under
the
statute
should
very
well
take
place
in
a
careful
manner.
and
we
ask,
what
is
the
logical
reach
of
--
or
what
is
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
a
statistical
imbalance
on
a
broad
scale?
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
c.
hotvedt
in
the
joint
appendix,
your
honor,
on
the
penultimate
and
--
and
final
page.
the
--
we
have
this
case
arising
from
within
san
antonio,
texas
where
we
have
three
individual
plaintiffs,
mexican-americans,
who
would
borrow
for
purpose
of
burden-shifting
proof,
black
and
mexican-american
statistics
from
the
system
at
places
where
those
jobs
existed.
but
what
logical
inference
is
there,
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
earlier
stipulation
that
they
had
not
been
discriminated
against
the
time
of
hire,
that
these
people
suffered
hiring
discrimination.
we
say
not.
we
think
it's
time
for
the
development
within
the
plaintiffs'
case,
of
a
requirement
for
congruity
between
the
statistics
they
used,
and
the
available
labor
market
and
skills
and
ages
of
the
workers,
and
whether
these
people,
as
plaintiffs,
and
as
members
of
plaintiff
class
were
reasonably
within
the
zone
who
--
of
those
who
could
have
been
impacted
by
the
adverse
hiring
decision.

certainly,
not
on
this

is
there
any
basis
for
concluding
that
they

mr.
richard

hotvedt
about
240
miles
away,
your
honor.
and
i
would
point
out,
that
the
fifth
circuit
somehow
sensing,
in
the
latter
stages
of
its
opinion,
that
it
--
that
the
element
of
discrimination
in
hire
is
somehow
an
element
of
the
--
the
guidance
it's
secured
from
this
court
earlier,
tried
to
supply
that
on
a
bare
record
by
presuming

with
a
reference

there
is,

level,

might
