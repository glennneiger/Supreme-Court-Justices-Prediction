what
do
you
understand
to
be
the
predicate
for
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
the
union
violated
the
--
the
act
here?
justice
byron

but
nobody
has
ever
been
transferred
except
for
the
--
if
--
if
the
company
discriminates.
justice
byron

white
but
there's
no
special
--
that's
all
there
was
in
this
case
also.
that
there's
no
--
no
finding
that
the
seniority
system
itself
was
discriminatory.
justice

yes.

if
the
court
have
to
disagree
with
you
and
say,
“well,
that

there
isn't
such
a
type
of
proof
requirement,”

you
still
would
be
of

you
still
would
be
a
--
a
--
an
object
for
the
remedy,
and
you
would
still
have
to
comply
with
them?
justice
byron

with
or
without
a
finding
that
you
violated
the

justice

but
you
wouldn't
have
to
say
that
the

justice

--
you
wouldn't
say
you
would
--
that
without
a
violation
of
the

having
been
properly
found
that
you
could
be
liable
for
back
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
--
and
i
think,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
the
district
court
was
going
to
have
to
work
out
some
allocation
and
liability
for
back
pay
--
justice
byron

--
between
the
union
and
the
company?
justice
byron

knowing
your
concession
would
go
to
--
go
to
back
pay.
justice
byron

white
mr.
baab
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
if
the
--
what
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
a
--
on
the
class
action
matter
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
itself
designated
to
class?
and
i
--
i
take
it
from
your
brief,
that
you
--
you
think
that
before
a
class
could
be
designated
that
there
--
that
there
has
to
be
some
hearings.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
--
what
do
think
that
--
isn't
the
--
if
we
--
if
we
agreed
that
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
have
done
that,
do
we
stop
there
and
send
it
all
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
--
with
respect
to
these
three
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
ms.
martinez?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
the
three,
named
defendants
in
view
of
the
--
of
the
findings
of
named
plaintiffs,
i
should
have
said,
with
respect
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
as
to
their
absence
of
qualifications,
each
of
them
had
been
engaged
in
or
involved
in
a
number
of
accidents
involving
injuries
to
people.
is
it
still
the
opposition
that
they
had
demonstrated
the
qualification
for
over-the-road
jobs?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
show
that
people,
anglos
had
been
employed
after
having
been
engaged
in
as
many
as
three
acts,
almost
involving
seven
individuals?
