mr.
william
baab
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
point
out
as
the
court
may
be
aware,
there's
an
important
factual
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
one
that
preceded
it.
that
is,
the
employer's
absolute
no-transfer
rule
at
the
san
antonio
terminal
which
absolutely
prohibited
the
possibility
of
city
drivers
transferring
to
road
jobs
under
any
circumstances.
as
we
pointed
out
on
our
brief
herein,
accordingly,
where
there
can
be
no-transfer
--
transfer,
seniority
rules
which
operate
only
on
transfer,
in
fact
never
operate.
so
indeed
at
the
san
antonio
terminal,
they
had
no
causal
effect
and
are
not
an
active
consideration
in
regard
to
alleged
violation
of
title
vii.
mr.
william
baab
it
lifted
its
no-transfer
rule,
as
i
understand
it,
at
road
domicile
terminals
for
a
short
period
of
time
in
1972.
mr.
william
baab
i
would
like
--
although
it's
been
discussed
in
the
preceding
case,
again
briefly,
we
address
the
issue
of
union
liability
concerning
these
seniority
rules
which
are
the
same,
of
course,
as
there
was
any
time
you
could
see.
initially,
i'd
like
to
say
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
think,
is
correct,
in
his
questions
about
the
position
of
the
union
as
a
rule
19
defendant.
we
think
that
would
be
our
proper
position
in
these
cases.
that
is
so,
because
we
regard
our
seniority
systems
as
bonafide,
not
having
the
genesis
in
racial
discrimination
and
because
we
would
then
be
present
for
the
accordance
of
relief.
but
i
do
want
to
state
that
we
regard
this
court's
opinion
in
franks,
as
being
very
clear
that
in
as
much
as
our
systems
are
bonafide,
they
do
not
and
cannot
be
read
to
bar
rightful
place
relief
and
in
clarification
of
what
was
said
to
and
by
mr.
wells,
i'm
authorized
to
state
that
this
union
supported
at
the
time
of
this
trial
and
this
case
in
rodriguez
and
(inaudible)
before
that
in
sense,
a
proposition
of
rightful
place
relief
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
william
baab
well,
without
putting
it
precisely,
it
states
that
because
the
seniority
rules
do
not
automatically
grant
to
those
who
are
alleged
to
be
discriminatees,
full
carryover
seniority,
we
quote,
“locked
them
in”
and
that
under
the
quarles
line
of
cases
violates
title
vii.
mr.
william
baab
but
that
--
that
is
the
point.
that's
the
company's
discrimination.
if
that
happens
and
that's
what
ought
to
be
addressed.
the
question
of
the
seniority
rules
and
their
applicability
is
one
of
relief.
mr.
william
baab
and
there
could
be
none.
mr.
william
baab
everybody
admits
it's
neutral
both
in
its
origin
and
on
its
face.
really,
the
whole
lock-in
theory,
at
least,
as
it
applies
to
these
cases,
is
one
of
relief.
mr.
william
baab
yes.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
william
baab
adequate
relief
based
on,
they
found
employer
discrimination
in
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
baab
yes.
mr.
william
baab
yes.
mr.
william
baab
to
honor
the
court's
award,
like
the
place
relief
to
those
discriminating
against
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
baab
on
a
very
general
basis,
as
applied
to
this
case,
job
bidding
and
layoff
and
recall,
seniority
and
road
jobs,
that
the
discriminatee
would
have
had
but
for
discrimination
against
him.
now,
that
involves
consideration
of
various
elements
which
would
include
either
an
application
or
approving
reason
why
no
application
would
be
made.
mr.
william
baab
yes.
mr.
william
baab
yes.
mr.
william
baab
from
--
from
that
time.
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
--
mr.
william
baab
qualification
and
vacancy.
mr.
william
baab
that's
correct.
mr.
william
baab
yes.
mr.
william
baab
yes.
mr.
william
baab
yes,
we
would.
mr.
william
baab
yes.
and
we
are
bound
by
the
rightful
place
theory
--
mr.
william
baab
--
as
the
courts
made
it
final.
mr.
william
baab
exactly
not.
well,
even
if
--
even
if
one
were
found
concerning
hiring
or
a
transfer,
we
still
think
we're
not
liable.
mr.
william
baab
yes.
mr.
william
baab
they
did
say
that,
and
--
but
of
course,
that
was
based
on
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
baab
the
only
rightful
place,
seniority
relief,
which
is
our
real
purpose.
and
incidentally,
i
--
there's
been
some
discussion
about
what
unions
could
have
done
concerning
relief,
which
is
--
and
mr.
justice
marshall
had
addressed
that.
this
contract,
of
course,
awards
road
or
city
seniority
upon
entry
into
that
particular
bargaining
unit.
of
course,
the
contract
in
franks
awarded
seniority
only
upon
date
of
employment
for
the
individuals
involved.
that
contract
was
not
considered
to
bar
the
rightful
place
relief
that
this
court
gave.
in
fact,
quite
the
contrary,
so
with
ours.
if
but
for
discrimination,
this
individual
would
have
been
in
the
road
unit,
there's
nothing
in
our
contract
that
would
bar
or
undercut
the
award
of
rightful
place
seniority.
really,
again
it's
just
a
problem
of
relief,
you
know.
and
--
but
i
want
to
point
out
in
any,
if
i
may,
the
impossibility
of
the
union's
position
in
doing
what
respondents
here,
and
the
government
in
other
cases,
has
suggested
that
we
must,
that
is
without
proof,
without
determination
of
discrimination
unilaterally
award
to
minority
city
drivers,
full
carryover
seniority
and
road
jobs.
that
is
what
respondents
say,
they
want
here
as
relief.
this
case,
as
mr.
hotvedt,
pointed
out,
was
tried
primarily
on
an
--
on
an
individual
basis.
in
proof,
concerning
the
three,
named
individuals,
the
trial
court
found
they
had
not
properly
applied
for,
had
not
been
qualified
for
and
had
not
been
discriminatorily
denied
road
jobs.
there
was
no
other
evidence
offered
at
trial
as
to
any
other
individual,
number
one,
applying
for
or
even
wanting
a
road
job
as
to
any
other
individual
in
a
class
of
some
200
people,
the
class
they
wanted,
the
texas-wide
class
even
being
qualified
for
a
right
--
road
job
and
scant
evidence
as
to
vacancy.
this
court
recognized
the
mcdonald
versus
santa
fe
trail
that
indeed
the
union's
title
vii
obligation
extends
to
members
and
represent
employees
of
all
races
were
we
unilaterally
to
award
road
seniority
to
minority
city
people
under
those
circumstances,
rights,
would
absolutely
have
a
claim
of
reversed
discrimination
against
us.
we
have
to
wait
until
either
the
individuals
alleged
discrimination
and
seek
and
use
the
grievance
procedure
to
prove
it
to
get
the
rightful
place
that
way
or
go
to
court
or
if
we
can
have
a
factual
a
factual
situation,
whereas,
we
do
from
time
to
time
work
out
an
agreement
and
affect
the
award
that
way.
but
the
solicitor
general
himself
has
agreed
in
his
brief
in
the
jersey
central
case
that
to
prefer
any
minority
individual
simply
because
it
has
membership
in
a
class
rather
than
based
on
a
showing
of
individual
discrimination
would
be
to
affect
reversed
discrimination.
that's
what's
prohibited.
we
don't
want
to
affect
reversed
discrimination.
nevertheless,
we
strongly
adhere
to
the
proposition
of
rightful
place
relief.
thank
you.
mr.
william
baab
they
use
the
word
“clearly
erroneous”,
a
careful
reading
of
the
--
of
his
reasons
for
doing
so,
i
think,
indicate
that
can't
be
supported.
but
they
do
use
the
word
as
for
saying,
“the
finding
was
clearly
erroneous,”
but
they
really
find
that
there
was
--
well
the
employer
said,
“discrimination
in
the
air”,
that
there
appeared
to
be
a
pattern
in
practice
of
discrimination
although
not
against
any
single
identifiable
person
than
to
get
that
background
while
the
findings
against
the
individuals
must
have
been
erroneous,
so
go
back
and
see
if
they
were.
mr.
william
baab
yes,
sir?
mr.
william
baab
well,
i
guess
that's
mr.
hotvedt's
brief
action
--
it
--
it
didn't
brief
the
question,
but
(voice
overlap)
i
think
there
should
be.
mr.
william
baab
i
would
think
not
upon
this
record.
i
personally
think
the
case
was
tried
as
an
individual
action.
no
proof
was
offered
concerning
the
class,
except
that
there
was
a
group
of
200
minority
city
drivers.
they
were
shown
no
adverse
impact
on
interview
by
virtue
of
the
alleged
actions.
mr.
william
baab
reinstate
--
mr.
william
baab
that
would
be
my
opinion
--
mr.
william
baab
--
because
there's
no
basis
for
finding
then
that
the
trial
court's
findings
as
to
the
--
as
to
no
discrimination
was
clearly
erroneous
or
its
factual
findings
on
which
that
was
based.
mr.
william
baab
then
in
the
trial
court.
thank
you.
