chief

i
am
also
authorized
to
announce
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
in
number
75-718,
east
texas
motor
freight
system
incorporated
versus
rodriguez
and
others,
together
with
two
other
cases,
related
cases.
this
case,
like
the
previous
one,
involved
alleged
employment
discrimination
on
the
part
of
an
employer
and
unions
in
the
trucking
industry.
three
mexican-american
city
drivers
brought
this
lawsuit
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
claiming
that
the
employer
and
the
union's
no
transfer
rule
and
seniority
system
were
discriminatory.
the
district
court
held
against
them,
finding
that
the
company's
policies
were
neutrally
applied
and
proper
business
practices
and
that
the
plaintiffs
have
not
been
discriminated
against
in
any
way.
further,
it
is
found
that
because
of
their
poor
driving
records
and
for
other
reasons,
none
of
the
plaintiffs
could
satisfy
the
qualifications
for
a
line
driver
job.
although
the
plaintiffs
have
brought
their
complaint
as
a
class
action,
they
had
never
moved
for
certification
of
a
class
and
had
stipulated
that
the
trial
concerned
only
their
individual
claims.
for
these
and
other
reasons,
the
district
court
ruled
that
a
class
action
was
inappropriate.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
discounting
the
reasons
relied
upon
by
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
certified
a
class
and
imposed
class
wide
liability
on
the
employer
and
the
unions.
we
granted
the
defendant's
petitions
for
certiorari
and
a
written
opinion
filed
the
day
with
the
clerk,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
a
plaintiff
is
not
entitled
to
bring
a
class
action,
unless
he
as
himself
a
member
of
the
class
he
purports
to
represent.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
upon
abundant
evidence
that
the
plaintiffs
lack
the
qualifications
to
be
hired
as
line
drivers.
furthermore,
each
has
stipulated
that
he
had
not
been
discriminated
against
when
he
was
first
hired
by
the
employer.
these
facts
showed
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
class
members
and
therefore,
not
proper
class
representatives.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
court's
written
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
