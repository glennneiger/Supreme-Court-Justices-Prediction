mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
rodriguez
case,
the
individual
plaintiffs
named
not
only
their
employer,
east
texas,
as
the
defendant,
but
joined
the
southern
conference
of
teamsters
and
its
--
their
own
local
union
657,
which
is
located
in
san
antonio,
the
trial
court
held
that
local
657
had
not
violated
either
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
or
section
1981
with
respect
to
these
three
individual
members
of
that
local.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
as
to
the
union's
and
specifically
657
with
this
language,
that
their
role
in
establishing
separate
seniority
rosters
that
fail
to
make
allowance
for
minority
city
drivers
who
have
been
discriminatorily
relegated
to
city
driver
jobs.
i
understand
that
language
to
mean
that
local
657
has
been
held
by
the
fifth
circuit
to
have
violated
both,
section
1981
of
title
42,
and
title
vii,
for
failing
to
establish
some
type
contractual
right
to
transfer
with
what
is
commonly
called
“company
seniority”.
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
some
of
the
pertinent
facts,
that
i
believe,
are
relevant
to
the
position
of
local
657,
with
regard
to
remedying
or
doing
what
the
honorable
fifth
circuit
said
it
should
have
done.
mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
the
jurisdiction,
the
geographical
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
of
local
657
is
bounded
on
the
south
by
the
mexican
border.
it
runs
north
approximately
250
miles
to
austin,
texas
and
west
some
distance.
so,
i
would
say,
approximately
200
miles.
does
that
answer
your
honor's
question?
mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
as
mr.
hotvedt
pointed
out,
local
657
has
no
representation
jurisdiction
of
any
road
drivers
employed
by
east
texas
because
none
was
domiciled
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
particular
local
union.
so
the
answer
--
mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
correct.
and
another
very
important
fact
about
this
particular
local
union
is
that
it
is
and
always
has
been,
an
integrated
local
union.
mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
it
depends,
your
honor,
upon
where
they're
domiciled.
if
they
were
domiciled
in
san
angelo,
which
is
within
another
local
jurisdiction,
that
local
would.
dallas
local
which
had
some,
i
believe,
at
the
relevant
time,
will
be
represented
by
that
local
union
in
dallas.
but
there
were
--
mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
exactly,
your
honor.
local
657
put
into
evidence
to
this
record
a
statistical
summary
of
the
racial
breakdown
of
all
the
employees
of
east
texas
motor
freight
for
the
period
from
1952
to,
i
believe,
1971.
if
my
memory
serves
me
correct,
that
statistical
summary
showed
that
mexican-americans
and
negro
employees
where
in
the
majority
in
the
employment
of
east
texas
within
this
jurisdiction
from
the
period
1952
until
1972.
in
further
anticipation
of
what
we
thought
would
be
the
plaintiffs'
attempts
to
show
some
specific
conduct
by
local
657
amounting
to
violation
of
these
two
statutes,
we
also
compile
and
there
is
in
this
record,
a
statistical
breakdown
of
the
general
membership
of
local
657
which
reflects
that
since
1965,
the
majority
of
the
general
membership
have
been
mexican-americans
and
negroes.
a
third
statistical
summary
that
was
introduced
by
local
657
pertained
to
the
racial
composition
of
this
particular
bargaining
unit.
and
by
that,
i
mean,
the
bargaining
unit
consisting,
and
covered
by
--
by
not
--
national
master
freight
agreement
and
the
southern
conference
supplement.
that
statistical
summary
also
showed
that
since
1965,
the
majority
of
the
employees
within
the
jurisdiction,
representation
jurisdiction
of
local
657,
working
for
this
employer
were
also
mexican-americans
and
negroes,
certainly
negating
any
contention
that
would
end
the
jurisdiction
of
local
657,
there
was
any
hiring
discrimination
by
this
employer
with
which
this
local
defendant
could
have
participated.
now,
then,
the
--
in
the
briefs
before
the
court,
we'd
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
bargaining
procedures
which
were
followed
in
the
negotiation
of
the
national
master
freight
agreement
and
also
the
southern
conference
supplement
to
which
local
657
is
a
party
by
reason
of
having
given
powers
of
attorney
to
national
and
regional
negotiating
committees.
there
is
also
evidence
in
this
record
that
at
no
time
from
the
period
of
1952
to
the
date
of
the
trial
had
any
member
of
this
local
union
ever
complain
in
a
meeting
called
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
contractual
demands
to
the
employer
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
in
these
contracts.
there
is
also
evidence
in
this
record
that
at
no
time
since
1952
had
any
minority
member
of
this
union
in
the
proper
meetings
call
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
contractual
demands
ever
made
a
complaint
that
these
contracts
locked
them
in.
and
at
that
so-called
lock
in
was
racially
discriminatorily.
mr.
edward
w.
penshorn
no,
sir.
i'm
saying,
your
--
your
honor,
that
basically,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
my
position
is
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
must
prove
more.
they
must
prove
some
conduct
by
local
657
other
than
a
mere
existence
of
separate
contracts
of
road
or
city
drivers
to
hold
this
local
union
liable.
that
is
my
position.
does
--
does
that
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
i
think
that
there
is
also
a
stipulation
in
this
record
that
insofar
as
local
657
is
concerned,
that
no
white
city
driver
has
ever
transferred
from
a
city
driver's
job
within
the
jurisdiction
of
local
657,
to
a
road
driver's
job
and
carried
with
him
his
company's
seniority
for
any
purpose.
in
fact,
if
my
memory
serves
me
right,
i
don't
recall
there
being
any
evidence
of
a
city
driver
transferring
to
a
road
job.
the
court
has
long
ago,
recognized
that
national
bargaining
units
are
recommended
and
promoted
by
congress
by
reason
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
as
i
have
already
stated,
local
657
entered
into
this
contract
and
was
into
this
negotiating
unit
and
was
bound
by
its
decision
as
a
bargaining
unit.
thank
you,
your
honor.
