justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
if
i
may,
mr.
hotvedt,
about
the
class
action
aspect
of
the
case
in
the
district
court.
the
plaintiffs
did
in
their
complaint
ask
for
a
class
certification,
did
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
here,
not
only
that
there
should
have
been
no
class
certification
on
the
merits,
but
that
they
were
under
some
sort
of
obligation
to
file
a
separate
motion
during
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
the
--
those
are
two
separate
points,
i
would
think.
one
is,
after
you
requested
a
class
certification,
your
complaint
to
simply
omit
filing
a
motion
prior
to
trial
under
the
--
i
think
that
would
stand
on
quite
a
different
footing
than
if
in
a
stipulation
in
an
open
court,
you
say,
we
no
longer
seek
class
certification.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
absence
of
such
statements
in
a
union
meeting
would
be
dispositive
of
this
claim,
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baab,
do
you
--
do
you
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
to
find
that
it's
clearly
erroneous
the
district
court's
disposition
of
those
three
individual
cases
that
you
mentioned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
reason
that
company
didn't
consider
the
applications
because
of
its
no-transfer
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
that
--
that
goes,
ms.
martinez,
only
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
preserved
their
right
to
have
the
district
court
make
the
determination.
it
--
it
doesn't
go
further
and
say
that
the
district
court
should
have
determined
it
in
--
in
their
favor?
would
you
not
agree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
the
factors
you'd
just
mentioned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
also
subject
to
the
rule,
aren't
you,
that
no
person
can
represent
a
class
of
which
he's
not
a
member,
which
we
have
stated
in
our
opinions.
that
is,
that
the
named
plaintiff
has
to
have
all
the
characteristics
of
the
class
which
he
purports
to
represent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
but
should
there
have
been
a
division
on
the
classes
if
one
of
them
was
willingly
to
give
up
his
over-the
--
his
san
antonio
seniority
and
one
wasn't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
might
be
discriminatory
in
either
aspect
but
in
--
as
justice
stevens
points
out
there
are
--
three
are
some
difference,
i
think
in
the
question
that's
raised
by
someone
who
says,
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
be
employed
now,
i'm
a
city
driver
in
san
antonio
and
i'm
not
willing
to
give
up
anything
i've
got
and
then
second
man
who
says,
i
want
to
be
employed
now.
i'm
a
city
driver
in
san
antonio.
i'm
willing
to
give
up
all
prior
benefits
if
you'll
just
put
me
on
in
san
angelo.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
none
of
--
if
none
of
them
wished
to
give
up
anything
that
they
had,
you've
got
a
different
argument
as
to
the
merits
though,
than
if
someone
says,
i'll
give
up
everything
i
have
if
you'll
just
take
me
on
anew.
