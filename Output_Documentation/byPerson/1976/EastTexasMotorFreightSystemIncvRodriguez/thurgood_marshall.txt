justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
still
--
i
understood
the
original
statement
this
court
of
appeals
could
have
said,
that
we
will
remand
it
for
consideration.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
would
--
they
did
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
those
--
i
mean
you're
not
limited
to
that.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
said
that
it
is
old.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
penshorn,
can
you
first
give
the
jurisdiction
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
of
the
local?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
does
that
--
does
that
include
the
city
drivers
and
the
road
drivers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
means
that
whole
area.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
whole
area,
they
were
not
within
that
area.
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
other
point.
who
represents
the
line
draft
that's
in
that
same
geographic
area?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
that
on
this?
is
it
true
that
these
three,
named
parties
on
san
antonio
and
in
san
antonio,
it's
impossible
to
transfer
from
city
to
road?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now,
why
is
that
discriminatory
on
the
basis
of
race,
color
or
national
origin?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
there's
nobody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
says
nobody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
while
you're
on
there,
how
many
anglo
or
negroes'
applications
were
denied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
this
is
what
the
case
was
all
about,
that
people
had
applied
and
been
denied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
or
what
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
city
employee
applied
and
was
not
given
a
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
--
did
they
apply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
many
are
these?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
your
idea
of
the
class
would
be,
those
who
applied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
--
you
mean
that
your
class
applies
to
everybody,
who
happens
to
be
a
negro
or
a
mexican.
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
or
whether
they
wanted
to
or
were
qualified
to
or
had
any
idea
of
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
now
asking
you,
what
is
your
idea
of
who
the
class
consists
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
--
that's
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
of
them
are
in
the
class?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
in
the
class.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
whether
they
wanted
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
size
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
of
that
class?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
those
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that
just
didn't
want
to
leave
the
canal
in
san
antonio
or
didn't
want
to
leave
alamo?
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
martinez?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
say
to
this
suggestion
of
sending
it
back
to
the
trial
court
to
zero
in
and
focus
on
whether
or
not
this
is
a
proper
class
action
and
what
is
the
class?
what
do
you
say
to
that
suggestion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
say
to
that
stipulation
that
the
only
thing
before
the
court
is
these
three
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
did
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
use
the
word
“only”.
the
stipulation
used
the
word
“only”
and
i
think
that's
what
they're
relying
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it's
quite
common
to
make
a
motion
to
have
a
class
action
and
have
the
court
rule
on
it,
up
or
down.
