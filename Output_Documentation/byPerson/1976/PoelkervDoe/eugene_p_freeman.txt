mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
pleases
the
court.
the
nature
of
this
case
generally
involves
the
assertion
of
an
indigent
pregnant
woman
that
she
has
a
constitutional
right
to
require
municipality
to
provide
the
surgeon
and
all
hospital
facilities
to
carry
out
her
first
trimester
decision
to
be
aborted.
the
city
after
this
court’s
decision
in
doe
versus
bolton
did
not
recognize
a
constitutional
duty
that
provide
such
abortions,
but
continued
its
policy
against
the
establishment
of
an
abortion
service
in
its
hospitals.
st.
louis
has
two
general
hospitals
and
i
say
advisedly
the
last
time
i
left
st.
louis,
indeed
there
is
debate
going
on
right
now
whether
to
abandon
one
or
not,
and
they
are
physically
separated
from
the
other
department
or
governmental
buildings
and
that
through
the
years
it
has
reflected
culture
of
the
state
which
as
the
court
well
knows,
missouri
has
had
a
criminal
abortion
statute
and
that
was
infused
within
all
of
our
civil
governmental
structure,
including
the
hospitals
and
that
situation
obtained
up
till
the
time
of
this
court’s
rule
and
doe’s
decisions,
and
thereafter,
although
at
that
time
there
was
considerable
debate,
confusion
addressed
to
the
problem,
but
there
never
any
express
direct
changing
of
the
established
hospital
policy
against
abortion
and
what
i
refer
to
as
abortion
is
non-therapeutic
or
elective
abortion.
this
case
rolls
over
that
policy
in
the
hospital
and
later
changed
by
a
trial
tactic
which
shall
allude
to,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
an
indigent
lady
appeared
at
hospital
and
our
hospital
does
not
allow
practice
by
private
physicians.
in
other
words,
all
of
the
physicians
in
the
hospital
are
governmental
or
city
employees
and
are
selected
through
civil
service
procedure.
the
lady
appeared
at
the
hospital
and
went
to
the
gyn
clinic
and
then
was
referred
to
the
obstetrical
clinic
of
the
hospital.
she
was
told
that
she
was
pregnant
and
there
is
some
dispute
in
the
position
of
the
parties
as
to
whether
she
asked
for
a
non-therapeutic
or
elective
abortion
at
the
time
from
the
physicians
there.
now
the
physicians
at
the
hospital
at
the
gyn
and
ob
clinics
represent
a
dual
position.
many
years
ago
and
i
think
i
am
accurate
in
telling
the
court
that
it
was
probably
20
to
possibly
25
years
ago,
the
city
of
st.
louis
was
some
in
accreditation
trouble
and
the
universities
that
provide
medical
schools
in
st.
louis
came
to
the
aid
of
the
city
and
st.
louis
university
was
one
of
those,
washington
university
the
other,
and
entered
into
an
arrangement
where
the
physicians
of
the
staffs
in
the
medical
schools
would
staff
the
various
services
of
the
hospitals
and
that
was
done
with
respect
to
the
gyn
and
ob
and
in
this
case
there
is
a
vestige
of
that
by
st.
louis
university
which
is
jesuit
catholic
institution
in
city
hospital
number
1
as
distinguished
from
another
hospital
called
homer
g.
philips
hospital
which
is
city
hospital
number
2
which
was
staff
by
washington
university
which
is
a
non-sectarian
hospital.
through
the
passage
of
the
years,
the
homer
g.
philips
hospital,
the
number
2
encountered
the
difficulty
of
washington
university
with
its
increased
demands
upon
its
own
organic
hospital
facilities
to
the
extent
that
the
physicians
were
not
furnished
or
at
least
in
sufficient
amounts
by
washington
university
to
that
hospital
where
in
the
case
of
city
hospital
number
1,
st.
louis
university
did
maintain
the
ob
and
gyn
services
in
the
hospital
in
contention
in
this
case.
it
has
a
state
that
is
an
accident
of
history.
the
lady
was
refused
of
her
request
of
an
abortion
after
she
was
told
that
she
was
pregnant
by
several
medical
students
who
were
associated
with
st.
louis
university
undergoing
their
training
under
the
auspicious
or
ages
of
st.
louis
university
under
the
instruction
of
senior
physicians
who
headed
the
various
services
there,
including
these
two,
ob
and
gyn.
the
reasons
given
at
the
time
were
the
physicians’
personal
reluctance
or
personal
morality
or
ethical
positions
against
performing
abortions
on,
in
this
case
happened
to
be
principally
a
financial
indication,
the
lady
was
without
funds,
felt
she
could
not
do
with
her
husband
unemployed,
felt
she
could
not
support
another
child
and
in
this
case
the
physicians
there
felt
that
they
could
not
render
an
abortion
service
to
a
woman
because
of
that
type
of
indication
without
any
medical,
physiological
indication.
the
plaintiff
or
respondent
here
did
not
get
the
abortion,
went
to
a
private
institution
through,
i
believe
the
arrangement
later
counsel
in
the
case
and
she
was
aborted
on
august
27.
now,
five
days
before
that
she
had
filed
suit
in
the
district
court,
august
17
and
this
was
before
service
was
had
upon
one
of
the
defendants
here.
the
case
proceeded
and
in
fine
developing
each
of
the
facts
in
it,
but
attempting
to
allude
to
them
as
they
come
into
because
of
the
issues,
the
case
developed
three
principal
matters
with
two
subordinate
ones
to
one
of
them
and
that
is
abortion
on
demand
and
the
appellant
abuse
of
digression
through
unreasonably
overturning
the
district
court’s
findings
and
the
appellant
conviction
and
punishment
of
the
mayor,
one
of
the
petitioners
here
of
bad
faith
and
then
there
was
the
initial
question
of
judiciablity
or
the
standing
and
mootness
of
the
question
when
it
was
existent
in
this
district
court.
there
was
a
trial;
an
appeal
on
the
judiciable
controversy
question,
a
reversal
by
the
eight
circuit
with
remand.
there
was
a
trial
on
the
merits
with
the
reversal
by
the
eight
circuit
and
remand
and
then
ultimate
two
appeals
after
that
on
the
question
of
the
attorney’s
fees
in
the
case.
the
eight
circuit’s
reasoning
is
based
upon
its
finding
of
a
denial
of
equal
protection
is
based
upon
an
assumption
that
child
bearing
and
abortion
are
equivalent,
and
therefore,
to
assist
childbearing,
but
not
offer
abortion
is
unequal
treatment
without
legal
justification.
in
the
arguments
of
some
of
the
other
cases,
i
think
this
question
has
been
lightly
touched,
but
i
think
i
can
provide
a
service
to
this
court
by
respectfully
suggesting
a
different
analysis
or
an
enlarged
analysis.
i
think
i
could
suggest
to
the
court
to
contrast
the
universe
of
childbearing
with
abortion.
i
think
the
judicial
point
of
view
is
required
to
be
different
in
a
case
such
as
this
than
it
has
been
in
any
other
type
of
cases.
your
honor’s
attention
in
the
abortion
cases,
roe
and
doe
and
parenthood
versus
central
missouri
and
some
of
the
others
has
been
centered
towards
abortion.
this
case
involves
something
far
more
broader
than
abortion
and
i
think
by
respectfully
suggesting
these
things
to
your
honors
that
it
maybe
of
help
in
your
honor’s
analysis.
the
court
will
certainly
recall
that
childbearing
is
a
consummation
of
a
person.
it
is
a
value
of
infinite
worth,
an
event
of
incalculable
consequences,
generation
as
its
process
and
life
as
its
end.
abortion
is
just
the
opposite.
it
is
the
prevention
of
the
birth
of
the
person.
it
is
the
obliteration
of
the
possibility
of
a
person.
it
is
the
interference
with
life
and
death
or
nonexistence
as
its
end.
childbearing
is
a
natural
process.
the
attitude
of
the
community,
including
the
medical
science
and
it
is
associated
with
in
part
is
to
support
and
assist
childbearing,
not
to
cause
it,
this
natural
phenomena.
abortion
on
the
other
hand
is
an
interruption
and
deliberate
termination
of
this
natural
process
and
thwarts
it.
in
objective
logical
extension,
childbearing
is
essential
for
the
continuation
of
the
human
race,
the
family,
the
community,
the
state
and
the
nation.
abortion
is
in
an
objective
philosophical
sense,
genocidal.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
not
in
this
proceeding
your
honor,
but
i
am
trying
to
lay
the
basis
to
show
the
interest
of
the
state
in
childbearing
that
is
non-existent
in
abortion.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
abortion
is
genocidal,
only
its
acceptation
or
antithesis
childbearing
allows
for
survival
of
mankind.
resulting
from
this
essence
is
the
individual
relationships
to
childbearing
and
abortions
are
totally
different.
they
are
unique
in
themselves
and
foreign
to
each
other
and
hostile
in
some
respects.
in
childbearing,
a
woman’s
objective
is
a
live
healthy
infant.
the
fulfillment
of
her
womanhood
and
a
wife
accomplishes
her
physical
and
spiritual
function
in
the
marital
status.
the
father
and
the
husband
realizes
the
establishment
or
enlargement
of
his
family
and
realizes
an
important
aspect
of
his
manhood
and
a
progeny
of
his
family.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
those
considerations
underlie
the
propriety
and
persuasiveness
of
the
distinctions
that
the
constitution
ought
to
recognize
in
the
different
treatment
of
abortion
and
childbearing.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
i
believe
that.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
lately,
historically
accurate,
i
believe
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
think
the
fact
that
it
occurs
vitiates
or
denies
the
rationality
underlying
childbearing
with
respect
to
--
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
well,
i
think
you
force
me
to
the
logical
position
that
that
is
probably
right
that
they
could
refuse
abortion,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question,
there
is
another
facet
of
the
intellectual
investigation
that
is
required
and
that
is
here
you
have
not
only
the
interest
of
a
woman
in
one
disposition
or
the
other,
you
have
the
interest
of
a
child
and
these
certainly
must
be
constitutionally
recognized
and
it
is
dependent
upon
that
choice
of
the
woman.
the
state
is
certainly,
i
would
suggest,
entitled
to
recognize
these
interests
in
childbearing
where
they
are
non-existent
in
abortion.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
no
your
honor,
if
you
gather
that
from
my
brief
i
gave
the
court
a
wrong
impression.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
let
me
detail
a
little
bit
of
the
facts
and
explanation
in
answer
to
your
question.
in
the
political
campaign
for
the
mayoral
election
in
st.
louis,
this
question
emerged
and
both
the
existing
mayor
at
the
time
and
his
successor
who
is
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
both
stated
that
they
were
opposed
to
abortion
as
a
political
platform
in
their
election.
they
made
that
statement
publicly
and
broadly.
now,
in
the
merits
of
this
case,
the
evidence
showed
in
the
trial
that
the
physicians
of
the
city
hospitals
were
unaware
of
this
position
of
both,
the
previous
mayor
and
the
mayor
and
existent
at
the
time
of
the
trial
at
both
hospitals.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
physicians
at
hospital
number
2
knew
anything
about
that
city
hospital
policy
and
certainly
there
is
positive
expressed
evidence
by
physicians
themselves
that
they
knew
nothing
about
the
policy
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
well,
what
i
tried
to
fairly
answer
the
question
your
honor
was
no
insinuation
of
the
policy
by
direct
action
of
the
mayor
down
to
the
operative
level
in
either
of
the
hospitals,
but
there
certainly
was
an
adopted
position
by
the
mayor
which
was
known
to
the
chief
administrator
of
the
hospital,
but
nonetheless
unknown
to
the
operating
physicians.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
i
cannot
answer
that
your
honor.
there
were
no
abortions
performed
to
my
knowledge
in
hospital
number
2.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
none
that
i
know
of,
no
sir.
i
think
i
might
further
enlarge
on
that
answer
by
saying
city
hospital
number
2
is
largely
staffed
by
persons
of
spanish
or
portuguese
–
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
that
is
right
your
honor,
but
i
am
telling
about
the
physicians
there
now
in
the
relation
and
you
have
a
moslem
and
catholic
situation
at
the
city
hospital
number
2
that
you
do
not
have
that
influence,
but
on
the
other
hand
st.
louis
university
provides
the
physicians,
the
chief
of
staff
at
city
hospital
number
1.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
well,
i
can
certainly
answer
for
city
hospital
number
1.
i
am
trying
my
best
from
hearsay
and
so
forth
about
city
hospital
number
2
because
that
was
not
litigated
nor
did
we
investigated
in
the
trial
at,
city
hospital
number
2.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
yes
it
did,
but
as
i
stated
it
did
not
get
down
to
physicians
and
the
policy
itself
was
subject
to
the
interpretation,
as
the
mayor
testified
in
the
trial
that
is
an
ultimate
question
for
the
physician
to
determine
whether
the
woman’s
life
or
her
health
is
in
danger.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
that
is
right.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
that
is
clear.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
well,
its
administration
is
another
level
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
no,
i
meant
to
illustrate
what
i
am
--
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
that
is
right.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
well,
i
would
say
that
it
had
coincided
with
the
policy
of
the
hospital
in
this
case,
but
i
would
not
think
it
would
be
the
causative
factor
of
the
policy
of
the
hospital
because
the
city
recognizes
the
right
of
each
physician
to
make
up
his
own
mind
and
practice
medicine
according
to
his
own
lights,
at
least
to
the
extent
of
not
providing
abortions.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
no
your
honor,
there
was
not
up
till
the
time
of
trial.
now
to
be
fair
in
that
question,
i
understand,
since
the
eight
circuit
declared
that
city
had
the
right,
there
were
two
successive
physicians
who
had
volunteered
their
services
for
a
part
time
and
did
perform
a
limited
number
of
abortions,
but
they
left
the
staff
after
that
and
my
understanding
now
is
that
there
are
no
physicians
that
will
perform
abortions
and
that
it
is
contracted
out
to
a
private
facility.
this
court
has
recognized
a
limited
privacy
right
of
abortion
in
absence
of
state
power
in
the
abortion
context,
but
it
did
not
diminish
or
degrade
society’s
historical
role
in
childbearing,
nor
did
it
create
opposition
or
make
any
connection
between
childbearing
and
abortion.
the
woman,
the
court
thought
does
have
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
abortion,
but
the
woman’s
constitutional
does
not
have,
not
to
say
and
it
is
related
to
her
privacy
interest
and
admits
only
of
limited
right
in
abortion.
realization
of
her
interest,
this
privacy
right
in
abortion
occurs
in
a
medical
context
in
relation
to
her
life
or
her
health.
abortion
determination
is
essentially
a
medical
decision
made
by
a
physician
for
her
life
and
health
and
in
privacy.
but
in
childbearing,
the
opposite
is
the
case
where
woman
is
not
in
the
abortion
context
that
is
she
has
determined
to
bear
children,
whether
she
is
pregnant
at
the
time
or
not
or
antecedent
or
post
pregnancy,
she
is
in
a
totally
different
continuum
that
exists.
no
abortion
decision,
her
legal
considerations
arise
for
her
or
the
state.
the
putative
child’s
interest
emerges
and
it
would
seem
to
be
very
constitutionally
considerable
by
the
state.
the
interest
of
the
child
would
seem
to
emerge
as
a
fundamental
factor
where
the
woman
makes
her
election
to
enter
childbearing
or
childbirth.
there
is
a
perfect
harmony
that
emerges,
that
can
at
least
be
contemplated
between
the
various
interests.
the
mother,
she
is
interested
in
the
situation
with
respect
to
herself.
the
child
certainly,
the
putative
child,
the
father
as
a
husband
at
least
and
the
community,
state
and
nation
emerge
at
this
point.
all
of
these
legal
relations
are
perfectly
accommodated
to
one
another
and
without
friction
or
opposition
to
one
another.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
well,
there
can
be
situations
of
course
your
honor
would
postulate
it
where
maybe
the
father
of
the
child
has
no
desire
or
legal
relationship
to
the
child.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
well,
your
honor
if
i
understand
your
question
accurately,
i
would
say
that
my
statement
still
holds
true
because
once
the
woman
has
made
the
decision
not
to
be
aborted
that
she
has
elected
for
childbearing,
all
of
the
considerations
of
health
and
so
forth
are
abstracted
from
her
situation.
the
interest
now
lies
in
protecting
her
health
in
childbearing
and
the
child
that
she
is
bearing
and
everyone
associated
with
her
because
--
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
then,
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
illustrate
that
you
are
in
a
totally
different
context
or
continuum
where
the
woman
has
made
an
abortion
decision
in
consistent
with
this
court’s
teachings.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
your
honor,
i
may
not
be
apprehending
the
thrust
of
your
question,
but
as
i
see
it
and
what
i
am
trying
to
say
to
the
court,
that
where
the
woman
has
made
the
election
for
childbearing
whether
it
is
a
threat
to
her
health
or
not,
different
interests
emerge
that
are
compatible,
whereas
she
has
made
the
election
albeit
within
the
teachings
of
the
court,
the
medication
decision,
but
ultimately
she
is
not
going
to
be
operated
on
unless
she
consents
to
it.
in
that
sense,
that
ultimate
choice,
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
abortion
and
childbearing
and
these
other
interests
irresistibly
emerge
in
childbearing
that
do
not
emerge
in
abortion.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
an
accident
in
what
way
your
honor,
you
mean
that
--?
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
that
is
the
way
i
thought
you
mentioned.
the
woman
still
must
make
the
election.
she
still
must
determine
and
if
she
had
--
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
no.
your
honor
is
taking
me
in
to
the
context
of
another
situation.
i
was
trying
to
illustrate
not
the
--
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
she
does
not
get
an
abortion,
no.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
i
have
not
developed
my
argument
to
that
point,
but
i
believe
that
barriers
and
can
be
explained
in
terms
of
equal
protection.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
no,
it
does
not
your
honor,
it
goes
farther
than
that.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
no.
the
abortion
question
i
see
is
in
a
totally
different
universe
than
the
question
of
childbearing.
mr.
eugene
p.
freeman
yes
i
believe
so
your
honor.
as
a
commentary
on
the
situation
of
the
difference
between
abortion
and
childbearing,
the
time
continuum
of
the
several
interests
existent
in
childbearing
commences
and
continuous
since
before
conception
until
the
adulthood
of
the
child
which
certainly
is
not
the
case
in
the
question
of
abortion.
you
have
the
marriage,
family,
health
and
counseling
for
the
wife,
parental
care,
medical
and
social,
gyn
and
obstetrical
care,
birth,
post
birth,
pediatric,
postpartum,
and
medical
and
social
services,
educational
formation
of
the
child,
moral
trainings,
school,
formal
schooling
and
ultimately
citizenship.
they
would
all
revolve
and
are
intimately
connected
with
childbearing
that
are
abstracted
from
the
abortion
question.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
there
an
equivalency
exists
between
abortion
and
childbearing
and
this,
i
believe
results
from
an
erroneous
viewing
that
child
bearing
and
abortion
are
surgical
procedures.
they
both
admittedly
are
surgical
procedures,
but
that
does
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
of
their
general
equivalency.
factually
and
legally,
i
believe
that
such
view
is
too
limited
and
inaccurate.
legally,
this
court
has
said
that
the
nature
of
a
woman’s
constitutional
right
is
essentially
a
medical
decision
by
a
personal
physician
confined
to
matters
that
relate
to
her
life
or
health.
this
court
has
showed
concern
for
woman’s
life
and
health
by
insistence
that
her
welfare
be
determined
by
a
freely
acquired
totally
independent
professionally
medical
judgment.
it
did
not
say
--
