mr.
frank
susman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1973,
this
court
in
roe
versus
wade
and
doe
versus
bolton
recognized
with
the
entire
nation
the
constitutional
right
of
a
woman
to
terminate
her
pregnancy.
in
the
succeeding
four
years
since
that
decision
enormous
benefits
have
accrued
to
the
women
of
this
country
and
for
example,
the
rates
of
septic
abortion,
illegal
abortion,
infant
mortality
for
the
use
of
amniocentesis,
maternal
mortality
and
other
comparable
rates
have
all
dropped
precipitously
and
yet,
there
has
been
one
segment
of
the
female
population
of
this
country
which
has
not
benefited
or
been
allowed
to
share
in
these
advantages
that
have
come
to
pass,
and
that
of
course
if
the
indigent
female.
this
has
occurred
due
to
two
basic
reasons.
one
is
the
restriction
on
medicaid
payments
which
occupied
this
court’s
time
this
morning
and
part
of
this
afternoon
in
regard
to
the
cases
arising
in
jurisdiction
of
pennsylvania
and
connecticut
and
the
second
encumbrance
from
the
public
sector
has
been
the
foreclosure
of
public
hospitals.
to
date
less
than
25%
of
the
public
hospitals
in
this
country
offer
the
procedure
of
abortion
and
this
segment
of
society,
the
indigent
female
was
not
been
allowed
to
share
in
the
advantages
of
this
court’s
decision
in
1973,
contribute
in
large
part
--
mr.
frank
susman
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
public
hospitals
are
intended
to
include
only
those
basically
owned
by
the
government
and
operated
by
them.
they
do
not
include
those
which
we
sometimes
call
semi-private
or
semi-public.
they
do
not
include
sectarian—
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
public
hospitals.
this
segment
of
the
society
that
we
are
discussing,
the
indigent
female
is
the
largest
portion
of
that
group
which
contributes
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
frank
susman
no,
it
would
not,
because
the
reasons
that
have
foreclosed
the
public
hospitals
from
providing
abortions
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
they
will
be
reimbursed
by
medicaid
and
in
fact,
the
state
of
missouri
is
presently
under
court
order
to
do
so
as
a
regard
of
singleton
versus
wulff
--
mr.
frank
susman
if
it
were
require
to
offer
abortion
then
what
the
policy
of
the
hospital
(voice
overlap)
mr.
frank
susman
i
am
not
sure
because
i
do
not
know
how
the
city
would
respond.
they
might
decide
not
to
participate
in
the
program.
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
since
the
second
reversal
by
the
eight
circuit,
they
have
been
performing
abortions.
mr.
frank
susman
they
initially
started
by
performing
the
procedures
within
the
hospital
facilities
themselves,
but
only
within
city
1.
they
have
never
have
offered
abortions
in
city
2.
then
there
was
period
of
time
in
which
they
had
some
difficulties
whether
for
reasons
of
their
own
or
otherwise
i
will
not
into
and
the
record
that
does
not
support,
but
they
stopped.
they
had
some
reasons
procuring
physicians
and
during
that
period
of
time
they
contracted
out
with
a
private
non-profit
tax
exempt
facility
which
is
basically
a
clinic
doing
abortion
procedures
and
nothing
else.
that
also
came
to
an
end
and
as
we
stand
here
today
the
city
of
st.
louis
has
reinstituted
in
city
hospital
number
1
its
own
program
for
doing
abortion
procedures.
mr.
frank
susman
number
2
has
never
done
abortion
procedures
and
has
no
plans
to
do
so.
if
a
woman
shows
up
at
city
2
and
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
justice
that
that
basically
serves
the
black
area
of
the
city
of
st.
louis,
she
is
referred,
always
has
--
that
is
correct,
no
question
about
it.
she
is
referred
to
city
hospital
number
1
for
the
treatment.
mr.
frank
susman
no
we
do
not,
i
do
not
think
because
there
is
a
constitutional
obligation
of
the
city
to
its
public
hospitals
to
provide
abortions,
so
that
means
they
must
do
them
at
every
hospital
facility
assuming
there
is
not
some
great
inconvenience.
i
also
do
not
personally
believe
that
they
could
not
fulfill
this
constitutional
obligation
by
in
fact
contracting
out
with
a
private
facility.
i
do
not
think
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
onsite
procedures.
i
think
they
are
contracting
out
during
this
period
of
time
we
have
been
previously
discussing
was
in
fact
constitutional
and
did
comply
with
the
order
of
the
eight
circuit.
it
is
this
segment
of
society,
the
indigent
female
which
is
the
largest
group
and
has
contributed
greatly
to
the
fact
that
the
illegitimate
c
rate
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
is
presently
46%.
one
out
of
every
2
births
is
now
illegitimate
in
the
city.
the
poor
segment
of
society
has
always
utilized
the
city
hospitals
as
their
sole
source
of
receiving
medical
assistance
and
the
poor
have
neither
the
economic
means
nor
the
sophistication
to
seek
out
a
broad
range
of
medical
services
and
they
never
have.
the
public
hospital
stands
as
an
exclusive
provider
of
medical
services,
the
delivery
of
medicine,
physicians,
facilities
and
related
services
and
yet
as
this
case
demonstrates
clearly
and
as
the
record
shows,
these
public
hospitals
are
the
subject
of
political
vagaries.
they
have
become
involved
in
the
political
campaigns
for
mayor
and
for
lesser
opposition
at
the
city
of
st.
louis.
this
is
not
a
case
as
the
petitioner’s
attempt
to
des-state
it
as
a
case
of
that
every
woman
has
the
right
that
we
are
seeking
to
imply
that
every
woman
has
right
to
an
abortion
at
a
public
hospital.
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
an
obligation
of
the
state
to
furnish
the
exercise
of
any
fundamental
right
and
clearly
abortion
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
such
a
fundamental
right.
we
do
not
believe
for
example
that
there
would
be
a
constitutional
right,
a
requirement
for
the
public
hospitals
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
to
offer
maternity
care
is
merely
an
equal
protection
argument,
that
if
they
offer
maternity
care
then
they
also
must
offer
the
procedure
of
abortion.
mr.
frank
susman
in
large,
in
almost
exclusively,
yes
sir
it
is.
this
case
really
is
merely
a
plea
that
the
badge
of
indigency
not
be
used
as
some
type
of
financial
bludgeon
to
coerce
the
indigents
to
submit
to
the
religious
and
moral
philosophies
of
those
in
political
control
and
those
who
manipulate
the
medical
and
financial
dole,
that
--
mr.
frank
susman
those
indigent
women
eligible
for
care
at
the
city
hospitals
who
elect
and
wish
to
carry
the
pregnancy
as
the
term.
mr.
frank
susman
this
case
is
basically
the
class
of
indigents,
although
in
the
city
of
st.
--
mr.
frank
susman
i
do
not
believe
it
does
although
the
eight
circuit
saw
that
as
an
additional
equal
protection.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do
not
believe
they
are
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
requirement
of
indigency
really
affects
the
class.
the
eighth
circuit
found
--
mr.
frank
susman
that
is,
yes
sir
correct.
those
who
go
to
the
public
hospitals
for
treatment
of
any
type
and
who
can
afford
to
pay
our
bill
for
the
services
rendered.
mr.
frank
susman
well,
i
think
to
answer
that
we
first
have
to
identify
who
the
clients
are
and
i
would
say
that
the
clients
are
the
class
of
pregnant
women
who
desire
to
terminate
those
pregnancies
and
in
comparison
to
them
is
the
class
of
pregnant
women
who
desire
to
carry
those
pregnancies
to
term.
mr.
frank
susman
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
more
easily,
yes.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
they
have
that
extra
option.
mr.
frank
susman
because
i
think
there
is
still
the
equal
protection
denial
regardless
of
whether
or
not
they
are
indigent.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
there
is
clearly
an
extra
argument
for
the
indigents.
i
think
that
is
an
extra
argument
for
denial
and
a
separate
basis
of
denial
of
equal
protection,
but
i
think
any
woman
whether
indigent
or
prosperous
has
a
right
to
equal
treatment
at
the
city
hospital.
as
a
purest
legally
yes,
as
a
practical
matter
no.
mr.
frank
susman
no
your
honor.
mr.
frank
susman
i
am
asking
for
a
comparison
between
those
women
regardless
of
their
economic
means
will
have
right
to
treatment
at
the
city
hospital
who
are
pregnant
and
desire
to
terminate
as
opposed
to
those
women
who
regardless
of
means
have
a
right
to
treatment
at
city
hospital
and
who
desire
to
carry
to
term.
mr.
frank
susman
and
the
charter
and
operation
of
the
institution,
yes.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
that
is
always
been
the
practice
regardless
of
the
treatment.
mr.
frank
susman
provided
it
performs
simultaneously
the
full
range
of
maternity
services
and
many
public
hospitals,
although
not
in
the
city
of
st.
louis,
but
throughout
this
country,
there
are
many
public
hospitals
that
do
not
have
any
maternity
departments
whatsoever,
that
they
have
close
them
down
for
variety
of
reasons.
our
legal
theory
would
not
allow
us
to
bring
a
case
against
such
a
public
hospital
and
demand
that
they
offer
abortion
procedures
if
they
do
not
simultaneously
offer
the
treatment
of
maternity
and
delivery.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
yes,
i
believe
they
could.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
there
is
a
first
amendment
issue,
but
it
has
not
been
raised.
it
has
been
raised
in
many
previous
abortion
cases
and
no
court
to
date
to
my
knowledge
has
seen
fit
to
recognize
it,
but
always
choosing
other
alternative
grounds
and
for
that
reasons
it
was
not
in
our
history.
it
is
clearly
they
are
working.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
true,
but
i
had
not
raised
such
argument
your
honor.
mr.
frank
susman
the
only
religious
view
involved
here,
our
moral
view
is
that
of
the
petitioner
poelker
who
testified
at
trial
that
the
only
reason
for
the
imposition
of
the
policy
of
his
edict
that
there
will
be
no
abortions
performed
in
the
public
hospitals
in
the
city
of
st.
louis
was
that
in
his
personal
belief
abortion
is
murder.
he
further
testified
that
he
never
made
any
investigations
or
studies
or
whatsoever
as
to
whether
they
have
the
necessary
facilities,
whether
the
personnel
there
was
willing
to
do
it,
whether
they
can
offer
them,
what
the
effect
would
be
on
other
services
offered,
whether
there
is
any
possibility
of
contracting
out
with
a
private
facility
to
do
them,
he
never
made
any
investigations
or
study.
he
had
a
sole
reason
and
that
was
he
thought
it
was
murder
and
that
is
why
he
issued
the
edict.
and
contrary
to
the
statements
of
my
brother
counsel,
two
of
the
four
positions
were
examined
and
treated
and
talked
with
jen
doe
when
she
appeared
on
her
visits
to
the
city
hospital,
two
of
the
four
clearly
stated
to
her
that
the
hospital
policy
would
not
allow
it
to
be
done
there.
all
four
of
the
physicians
or
students
classing
them
together,
two
were
students;
two
were
actually
physicians
at
the
time,
all
four
testified
that
they
had
personal
moral
beliefs
against
providing
the
procedure.
one
of
the
doctors,
the
one
in
charge,
the
chief
resident
of
ob/gyn
would
even
refuse
to
give
to
jen
doe
a
statement
as
to
the
existence
of
her
pregnancy
so
she
could
take
the
statement
elsewhere
and
seek
relief.
he
would
not
even
give
her
such
a
statement.
he
said
that
was
his
policy
never
to
give
statement
of
pregnancy
to
any
woman
who
desired
an
abortion.
now,
all
of
these
persons
whether
students
or
physicians
are
associated
with
st.
louis
university,
but
the
trial
court
itself
stated
clearly
and
there
was
no
dispute
that
it
was
a
catholic
university,
but
the
trial
court
further
stated
that
no
one
associated
with
that
university
would
ever
perform
an
abortion.
and
in
fact,
it
was
introduced
in
the
evidence
and
it
appears
in
the
record
that
the
faculty
manual
at
st.
louis
prohibits
anybody
associated
with
the
university
of
doing
an
abortion
and
a
judge
would
so
testify
and
that
if
you
did
such
a
procedure
you
would
be
subject
to
loss
of
appointment,
contract
and
tenure
for
doing
so.
mr.
frank
susman
absolutely
not
and
i
would
be
the
first
to
come
here
and
defend
any
individual
physician’s
right,
nurses
or
orderlies
to
refuse
on
their
personal
religious
moral
grounds
to
participate
in
such
a
procedure
which
violates
their
religious
principles.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
there
has
to
be
and
the
word
reasonable
gets
tossed
around
so
much
with
lawyers
and
judges,
but
i
think
there
has
to
be
reasonable
efforts
to
procure
the
services
of
individuals
who
do
not
share
those
personally
held
--
mr.
frank
susman
alright,
then
you
are
weighing
in
the
balance,
in
my
opinion,
the
choice
of
compelling
a
physician
to
do
this
procedure
which
he
is
personally
opposed
to
for
religious
or
moral
reasons
as
against
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
compelling
the
woman
who
wants
the
abortion
to
travel
to
some
indeterminate
distance
to
procure
it
elsewhere
and
putting
those
two
in
the
balance
in
my
opinion
would
weigh
and
favor
the
physician
who
does
not
want
to
participate.
she
must
travel.
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
also
a
realistic
and
possibility,
but
i
would
again
point
out
here
that
ever
since
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeal
ruled
in
this
case,
the
city
has
been
furnishing
these
procedures,
has
been
able
to
find
physicians
because
they
got
them
from
washington
university
which
is
a
nonsectarian
institution.
and
that
washington
university
has
always
maintained
its
own
clinic
which
does
outpatient
terminations
to
pregnancy.
they
could
not
provide
the
physicians
before
because
st.
louis
university
was
contracted
to
provide
all
of
the
gyn
services.
obviously
you
are
playing
with
a
stacked
deck
or
you
were
in
the
past.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
the
mayor
is
entitled
to
his
personal
opinions.
he
does
not
have
to
participate
in
any
abortion
decision,
but
he
does
not
have
the
right
by
edict
to
forbid
the
performance
of
abortions
within
the
public
hospital
institutions.
mr.
frank
susman
this
was
not
a
factor
considered
by
the
administration.
mr.
frank
susman
the
physicians
because
--
mr.
frank
susman
that
is
correct
perhaps
i
did
not
understand
your
question.
mr.
frank
susman
because
i
can
draw
a
vast
distinction
between
the
opinion
of
the
doctor
who
must
participate
in
the
actual
procedure
and
performance
as
opposed
to
the
mayor
having
his
private
beliefs.
he
does
not
have
to
participate
in.
he
can
believe
anything
he
wants.
nobody
is
asking
him
to
participate
or
perform
one.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do
not
believe
that
is
a
legitimate
reason
or
rationale
with
the
government
or
the
city
of
st.
louis
in
this
case
to
justify
the
deprivation
of
women’s
constitutional
rights
to
an
abortion
as
stated
by
this
court
in
roe
and
doe.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
standard
is
clear
that
we
are
talking
about
a
compelling
a
state
interest
and
the
moral
beliefs
of
the
mayor
do
not
in
my
mind
constitute
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
frank
susman
it
was
admitted.
it
was
no
question
that
the
policy
existed.
mr.
frank
susman
no
it
was
not.
mr.
frank
susman
it
was
not
an
ordinance.
it
was
not
a
hospital
regulation.
mr.
frank
susman
no
sir.
mr.
frank
susman
it
is,
in
quotation
as
to
what
the
edict
was,
no,
that
is
not
in
the
record.
there
is
the
testimony
from
the
mayor
that
he
did
issue
such
an
order
to
his
codefendant
petitioner
dr.
wagner
who
is
commissioner
of
hospitals
who
testified
that
he
would
have
wanted
to
perform
the
procedures
and
thought
they
ought
to
be
performed
but
could
not
because
of
the
mayor
who
appointed
him
and
--
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
there
are
two
things.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
it
becomes
less
a
question
of
setting
aside
than
taking
the
top
chosen
by
the
eight
circuit
and
imposing
it
in
a
permitted
duty
upon
the
petitioners
to
allow
and
to
provide
the
necessary
facilities
and
personnel
and
resources
on
a
comparable
basis
as
they
are
provided
for
those
who
choose
maternity.
mr.
frank
susman
i
think
there
are
some
serious
questions
as
to
whether
the
edict
or
lack
of
a
better
word,
the
mayor
or
the
petitioner
poelker
in
this
case
really
had
much
legal
substance.
mr.
frank
susman
well,
two
of
the
students
have
graduated.
i
think
dr.
adman
--
mr.
frank
susman
ignoring
for
the
moment
the
legally
or
illegality
of
the
mayor’s
edict,
the
record
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
co-petitioner
dr.
wagner
relied
upon
it
in
not
providing
abortions
which
he
choose
to
do
were
it
not
for
the
edict.
so
number
one,
i
think
that
petitioner
wagner
could
be
directed
to
ignore
this
edict,
legal
or
illegal
and
be
allowed
to
proceed
to
offer
these
procedures,
that
physicians
be
obtained
as
they
have
been
since
november
of
1974,
several
months
after
the
eight
circuit
ruled
and
they
have
been
providing
these
procedures.
mr.
frank
susman
i
understand
that,
but
what
we
do
have
are
the
un-contra
worded
facts
that
abortions
have
never
been
performed
in
the
city
hospitals
of
st.
louis.
we
also
have
the
un-contra
worded
fact
that
there
were
two
things
that
prevented
these
abortions
from
being
provided
and
one
was
the
mayor’s
--
mr.
frank
susman
well,
the
edict
applied
to
both.
mr.
frank
susman
well,
there
were
no
evidence
as
to
the
practice
of
two
because
there
was
only
one
identifiable
named
plaintiff
and
she
only
went
to
city
hospital
number
1,
but
the
mayor’s
edict,
the
record
shows
applied
to
both
hospitals.
the
staffing
procedure
only
applies
to
city
hospital
number
1,
that
hospital
at
which
jen
doe
appeared
and
attempted
to
procure
the
medical
services
desired
by
her.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do
not
believe
they
are.
they
are
employees,
independent
contractors.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do
not
believe
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
frank
susman
state
actions
comes
not
in
the
individual
practices
of
both
physicians,
but
again
to
the
mayor’s
policy
in
number
2,
the
staffing
procedure
which
allows
them
to
be
staffed
in
such
a
manner
that
you
will
not
have
a
position
who
does
not
have
moral
principles
against
performing
abortions.
the
state
action
is
not
in
the
individuals
who
actually
comprise
the
staff,
but
the
policy
of
the
state
that
allows
it
to
be
staffed
in
such
in
a
fashion.
it
is
a
staffing
policy
that
was
attacked,
not
the
staff
per
se
and
that
policy
clearly
is
state
action.
again,
petitioner
poelker
never
offered
any
justification
nor
was
there
any
in
the
record
nor
has
counsel
indicated
any
in
argument
other
than
the
mayor’s
personal
beliefs
resulted
in
this
policy
that
presently
exists.
i
do
not
think
there
is
much
reason
to
devote
much
time
to
the
issue
of
standing
which
is
one
of
the
other
three
issues
in
this
case,
because
i
think
that
is
clearly
decided
under
the
prior
decisions
to
this
court.
i
would
briefly
mention
the
attorney’s
fee
issue.
although,
counsel
did
not
have
time
to
argue
with
it
orally,
i
would
suggest
all
of
the
arguments
included
in
their
brief
are
completely
undercut
and
obviated
by
the
recent
passage
of
public
law
94-559
allowing
for
attorney’s
fees
under
the
original
appellant
court
theory
a
private
attorney
general.
i
think
under
the
whole
lien
of
bradley
versus
richmond
school
district,
it
is
retroactive.
i
think
the
legislative
history
which
we
furnished
to
the
court
by
reference
in
a
letter
updating
our
brief
shows
that
it
was
intended
to
be
retroactive.
there
have
been
two
decisions
today,
one
by
the
northern
district
of
mississippi
on
december
14,
1976
and
one
by
united
states
court
of
appeals
of
the
eight
circuit
last
thursday,
on
january
6
both
holding
in
fact
that
this
public
law
is
in
fact
retroactive.
mr.
frank
susman
correct,
absolutely
prevailing
party
only.
mr.
frank
susman
and
the
appellant
court,
they
will
award
it
at
both
levels.
mr.
frank
susman
they
were
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
appellant
court
fees
were
awarded
first
and
then
it
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
awarding
the
counsel
fees.
so
chronologically,
the
appellant
fees
came
first.
all
of
these
fees
are
presently
now
in
the
registry
of
the
court
having
paid
in.
in
conclusion,
while
it
is
true
that
the
policies
of
the
petitioners
have
not
totally
foreclosed
abortions
for
women
of
low
and
marginal
incomes
in
the
city
of
st.
louis,
the
effect
upon
their
access
to
services
has
in
fact
been
devastating.
for
no
other
reasons
in
the
petitioner’s
hospital
policies,
they
have
been
denied
the
equal
protection
in
the
making
of
a
constitutionally
protected
choice.
they
have
suffered
in
fact
a
cruel
coercion
of
financial
support
to
choose
carrying
the
term,
although
against
their
desires
and
against
in
many
cases
their
best
interest
of
life
and
health.
to
ignore
the
economic
bait
forces
them
to
rely
upon
the
charity
and
beneficence
to
the
private
medical
sector
for
assistance,
a
degrading
alternative.
and
lastly,
we
would
note
that
to
deny
the
indigent
women
the
same
rights
of
access
to
control
over
their
own
reproduction
fosters
a
perpetuation
of
the
cycle
of
poverty
generation
after
generation
and
denies
them
an
opportunity
to
escape
and
to
rise
above
the
conditions
of
their
environments.
thank
you.
