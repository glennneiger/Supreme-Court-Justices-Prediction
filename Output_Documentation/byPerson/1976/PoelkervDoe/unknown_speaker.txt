unknown
speaker
mr.
freeman,
we
must
over
rule
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
is
interesting,
the
way
you
want
to
end
up.
unknown
speaker
a
lot
of
this
is
true
with
respect
to
the
whole
spectrum
here
whether
the
payment
is
made
by
the
state
or
whether
the
city
furnishes
the
service
or
whether
it
does
not,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
polity,
as
another
state
policy,
as
state
quite
apart
from
our
constitution,
but
simply
as
a
matter
polity
or
state
policy,
a
state
could
have
either
polity,
could
it
not
and
state
have
historically
had
both
policies.
states
have
historically
given
bounties
for
large
families
and
states
have
historic,
i
am
talking
about
states
in
the
world,
not
states
necessarily
in
the
united
states,
but
organized
government,
organized
society
has
decided
to
encourage
large
families
in
some
states
in
some
points
in
history
and
states
equally
have
hit
upon
a
policy
of
encouraging
small
families
and
there
are
states
today
that
are
doing
that,
india
and
others.
each
has
a
permissible
rational
state
policy.
states
have
historically
done
both,
have
they
not?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
public
policy.
unknown
speaker
either
as
rational
policy
from
the
point
of
view
of
state
policy
i
would
presume,
at
least
each
has
historically
been
followed
at
one
time
or
another
by
one
nation
or
another,
is
it
not
that
true?
unknown
speaker
suppose
mr.
freeman
there
were
no
hospitals
in
the
city
of
missouri
and
the
city
of
st.
louis,
except
those
maintained
those
maintained
by
public
authority,
so
there
was
monopoly.
would
you
suggest
that
all
of
those
hospitals
could
refuse
under
any
circumstances
to
have
abortions
performed?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
not
implicitly
recognize
the
right
to
be
treated
in
a
public
hospital
when
you
point
out
as
i
believe
you
do
in
your
brief
that
in
the
hospital
number
2,
there
are
no
barriers,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean
barriers
exist
in
both
hospitals?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
the
rule
was
not
as
strict
as
it
was
in
hospital
number
1?
unknown
speaker
none?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
hospital
20
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
then
is
it
fair
to
infer
from
what
you
said
that
neither
hospital
as
a
hospital
had
a
policy,
but
it
is
depended
upon
the
views
of
the
staff
and
in
both
hospitals
apparently
the
staff
had
views,
moral
or
religious
views
that
made
them
object
to
performing
non-therapeutic
abortion.
unknown
speaker
but
did
city
hospital
number
1
have
an
official
hospital
policy?
unknown
speaker
but
both
the
hospital
and
the
staff
in
hospital
number
1
presumably
had
a
practice
and
a
rule
that
they
followed
of
not
performing
non-therapeutic
abortions?
unknown
speaker
that
is
clear.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
hospital
apart
from
its
staff.
no
one,
but
the
doctors
can
perform
abortion,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
they
cannot
perform
abortion?
unknown
speaker
when
the
doctors
individually
decide,
it
is
an
individual
decision
of
the
physician
i
thought
you
told
us
earlier.
unknown
speaker
and
they
all
decide
the
same
way,
does
that
make
it
a
policy
of
the
hospital?
unknown
speaker
does
this
record
show
that
there
is
any
doctor
who
was
excluded
from
the
staffs
because
he
would
perform
abortions,
the
elective
abortion
so
called?
unknown
speaker
well
at
all
times,
mr.
freeman?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
digging
up
of
those
occasions
when
the
mother’s
health
is
in
danger
and
then
the
physician
and
the
patient
have
to
make
a
position
as
between
the
two
interests.
so
i
am
merely
asking
whether
at
all
times
what
you
are
saying
to
what
compatible
is
true?
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
is
the
other
way,
then
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
let
us
get
away
from
the
woman.
the
physician
has
advised
that
because
of
her
health,
her
life
will
be
endangered.
all
i
am
trying
to
point
out
is
and
contradistinction
your
general
statement
that
sometimes
the
interest
of
the
mother,
the
child,
the
father
are
not
always
compatible,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
how
about
where
it
was
an
accident?
unknown
speaker
you
know.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
she
goes
to
the
hospital
number
1
and
you
say
uh,
uh,
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
that
if
it
was
an
accident
and
she
goes
to
hospital
number
1
and
she
explains
this
accident,
she
does
not
get
an
abortion.
unknown
speaker
and
if
she
was
raped
the
same
would
be
true?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
see
a
thing
wrong
with
that.
unknown
speaker
does
your
argument
end
up
to
that,
is
that
where
you
go?
unknown
speaker
you
are
making
exceptions
though?
unknown
speaker
in
childbearing,
of
the
child
that
is
a
result
of
rape,
do
you
say
that
(inaudible)
is
interested
in
that?
unknown
speaker
public
hospitals,
you
mean
that
governmentally
operated
hospitals
that
serve
the
indigent
patients?
unknown
speaker
either
establishment
owned
and/or
operated
hospitals
that
serve
indigent
patients.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
25%
figure
is
for
public
hospitals
or
all
hospitals?
unknown
speaker
will
the
particular
problem
of
public
hospitals
go
away
if
the
social
security
act
for
medicaid
required
a
payment
for
abortion?
unknown
speaker
you
publicly
stated
that
if
the
state
is
going
to
participate
the
medicaid,
what
if
it
is
required
to
pay
for
abortion?
unknown
speaker
your
problem
will
go
away
or
not?
unknown
speaker
this
is
just
located
in
the
cities,
not
the
state,
i
suppose
by
a
state
statute.
the
state
legislature
decides
whether
to
participant
or
not.
unknown
speaker
or
the
city
corresponded
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
in
the
hospitals
or
by
contracting
them
out
to
–
unknown
speaker
what
about
number
2?
unknown
speaker
do
you
make
any
separate
complaint
of
the
fact
mr.
susman
that
abortion
even
under
the
eight
circuit
mandate
are
available
only
at
hospital
number
1
and
not
at
hospital
number
2?
unknown
speaker
so
your
whole
constitutional
argument
is
bottomed
on
equal
protection
promises
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
in
comparison
with
whom,
are
your
clients
being
denied
equal
protection?
unknown
speaker
that
is
just
a
comparison
between
indigent,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
the
evidence
of
class
of
indigent.
the
indigency
does
not
make
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
did
you
see
it
as
discrimination
as
between
two
classes
of
pregnant
indigent
woman,
do
you?
and
the
one
class
gets
medical
care
at
the
city
hospital
if
they
give
birth
or
if
they
have
a
miscarriage
and
the
other
class
of
pregnant
woman
does
not
get
care
at
the
city
hospital
if
they
want
to
have
an
abortion,
is
that
it?
are
those
the
two
classes?
unknown
speaker
they
are
all
the
indigent.
the
universe
is
indigent
women
or
they
would
not
be
at
the
public
hospital,
as
you
defined
it
earlier?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
who
are
your
classes?
i
(inaudible)
think
well,
in
compared
to
whom
are
your
clients
being
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
indigent
and
affluent?
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
are
affluent
they
can
go
anywhere
to
realize
their
desire
to
have
an
abortion
at
the
same
price
as
they
would
have
to
pay
at
the
public
hospital.
unknown
speaker
they
would
go
to
the
private
hospital,
certainly.
unknown
speaker
then
how
can
you
make
that
class
then?
how
can
you
put
them
in
your
class?
unknown
speaker
how
is
the
millionaire
person,
female
denied
any
protection
as
she
goes
to
private
hospital
in
switzerland
and
has
a
baby,
i
mean
an
abortion.
she
cannot
be
in
the
same
category,
can
she
would
be
indigent?
unknown
speaker
do
you
need
that
to
win?
unknown
speaker
what
comparison
do
you
want
us
to
make
now?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
right
to
treatment,
do
you
mean
right
to
treatment
under
the
practices
of
city
hospital?
unknown
speaker
and
the
practices,
i
mean,
at
first
you
can
pay
or
will
be
treated
that
they
will
collect
from.
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
city
of
st.
louis
as
a
governmental
entity
cannot
maintain
a
hospital
which
declines
to
perform
abortions?
unknown
speaker
mr.
susman
you
say
that
you
want
your
clients
to
be
freed
from
the
prejudices
and
moral
judgments
of
the
majority,
and
yet
if
we
sustain
your
argument
here,
if
that
majority
in
st.
louis
city
or
st.
louis
county,
whatever
feels
strongly
about
it,
they
can
simply
cut
off
the
rendering
of
any
sort
of
maternity
service.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
could
they
cut
out
this
furnishing
any
maternity
services
without
payment,
but
still
furnish
the
service
if
somebody
can
pay?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
first
amendment
issue
in
this
or
has
there
ever
been?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
not
raised,
we
perhaps
are
not
permitted
really
to
look
at
your
argument
about
the
religious
use
of
the
majority
of
the
community
and
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mentioned
them
passionately.
unknown
speaker
what
if
in
fact
in
a
small
town,
all
of
the
doctors
in
the
public
hospital
have
those
religious
beliefs?
do
you
think
the
constitution
compels
the
city
to
compel
them
to
perform
an
abortion?
unknown
speaker
then
where
would
you
end
up?
in
a
hypothetical
case
where
the
only
people
on
the
hospital
staff
and
the
only
competent
people
they
can
get
on
the
hospital
staff
have
those
religious
beliefs?
unknown
speaker
my
hypothesis
is
those
reasonable
efforts
have
been
made
and
they
cannot
find
anybody
competent
who
is
willing
to
work
in
that
hospital
as
doctors
on
the
staff
who
do
not
have
those
religious
beliefs?
unknown
speaker
or
the
town
had
constitutional
duty
to
subsidize
the
travel
of
the
woman,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
susman,
you
seem
to
me,
you
have
admitted
that
the
deck
was
stacked
by
the
physicians’
religious
and
moral
convictions
that
would
be
permissible,
but
when
you
look
at
the
mayor
and
the
supervisor’s
moral
convictions,
you
say
that
is
intolerable
even
to
consider
as
a
factor?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
is
a
complete
justification
for
the
doctor,
why
is
not
a
factor
that
might
be
considered
by
the
hospital
administration
at
least?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
the
whole
reason
for
was
their
religious
and
moral
opposition
to
abortions?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
thought
the
mayor,
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
i
thought
the
mayor
himself
was
opposed
on
moral
and
religious
grounds.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
if
that
is
illegitimate
consideration
for
a
doctor,
why
is
it
not
also
at
least
a
legitimate,
maybe
it
should
not
be
controlling,
but
at
least
the
legitimate
consideration
for
another
government
official?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
us
say
his
private
strongly
held
beliefs
that
he
has
publicized
and
on
the
basis
of
which
he
is
been
elected
to
office
to
run
the
hospitals
by
majority
of
the
people.
unknown
speaker
what
can
we
have
in
this
record
to
show
exactly?
is
there
anything
in
the
writing
about
this
policy?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
is
there
anything
in
writing,
written
down?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
in
ordinance.
it
was
not
in
the
regulation
of
the
hospital.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
written?
unknown
speaker
the
edict
you
say
that
the
mayor
issued,
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
get
is
that
what
do
we
set
aside
that
the
city
did?
unknown
speaker
we
set
aside
the
fact
that
two
employees
refuse
to
do
the
job,
four
employees,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
am
trying
to
find
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
talking
about.
so
if
that
has
no
substance,
what
do
we
do,
we
enjoin
these
four
people
from
doing
it
because
they
are
gone
by
now?
they
have
graduated
out.
unknown
speaker
normally
we
have
an
ordinance
that
we
declare
on
such
students.
do
we
have
a
statute
here
or
we
have
an
order
of
a
state
agency?
here
i
am
trying
to
find
out
what
was
done
by
the
state
that
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
one
hospital
was
doing.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
said
that
it
was
(inaudible)
it
was
not
really
the
case?
unknown
speaker
are
the
doctors
in
the
city
hospital
in
st.
louis
seek
offices
under
the
laws
of
missouri?
unknown
speaker
are
they
state
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
so
where
do
you
get
the
state
action?
unknown
speaker
if
you
win?
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
concerned
with
these
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
were
they
finally
awarded
in
both
levels?
