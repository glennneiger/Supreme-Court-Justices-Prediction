mr.
winn
newman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
goldstein
has
articulated
the
legal
theories
supporting
our
view
that
the
charge
was
filed
timely.
i
should
like
to
make
one
additional
comment
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
namely
the
date
on
which
the
violation
occurred
and
then
devote
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
the
equitable
considerations
in
respect
to
the
tolling
issue.
in
the
industrial
world,
it
is
well
understood
that
a
first-level
foreman’s
decision
is
hardly
the
last
word.
this
generally
results
or
may
result
in
request
from
the
union
for
a
review
of
that
decision
which
the
foreman’s
action
has
triggered
and
that
decision
is
then
as
you
know
reviewed
and
culminates
into
review
through
various
steps
of
the
grievance
procedure,
including
high-ranking
company
and
union
officials.
mr.
winn
newman
the
pay
stops,
in
a
case
of
a
discharge
and
in
most
cases,
immediately,
not
in
all
cases
and
it
did
stop
in
this
case
immediately.
however,
the
decision
is
not
an
appeal
kind
of
thing.
it
is
not
an
appeal
to
up
the
steps.
it
is
a
review
by
other
management
to
determine
whether
the
action
is
consistent
with
the
company
policy
or
the
union
contract
and
that,
i
submit,
is
the
way
in
which
it
was
looked
at
in
the
industrial
world.
mr.
winn
newman
the
grievance
was
filed
with
the
charge
of
unfair
action,
but
that
is
not
untypical
of
grievances
that
are
filed.
mr.
winn
newman
no,
the
language
used
in
the
grievance
did
not
allege
racial
discrimination.
however,
a
grievance
that
alleges
unfair
actions
does
include
any
unfair
action
as
held
by
arbitrators
in
legion
which
includes
race
discrimination,
sex
discrimination
or
any
disparate
treatment.
mr.
winn
newman
there
was
no
identification
of
it.
mr.
winn
newman
your
honor
i
suppose
it
might.
mr.
winn
newman
i
suppose
it
might
if
it
is
a
totally
different
grievance.
we
submit
that
in
this
case,
this
grievance
of
unfair
action
did
in
fact
cover
any
unfair
treatment
relating
to
her
discharge.
mr.
winn
newman
the
grievance
procedure
itself
is
not
in
the
record.
what
took
place
in
that
grievance
procedure
as
you
know
is
a
very
informal
process,
so
there
is
no
record
of
what
took
place,
but
the
company
too,
both
sides
have
the
burden
of
establishing
the
facts
on
the
way
up
through
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
winn
newman
the
employer
has
notice
of
what
the
union
is
alleging
in
the
grievance
procedure.
there
is
no
formal
record
that
we
have.
the
issue
came
up
in
the
grievance
procedure,
but
i
could
tell
you
that
it
is
in
the
record,
obviously
i
cannot
do
that.
mr.
winn
newman
but
i
can
say
that
if
this
issue
had
gone
before
an
arbitrator
with
a
charge
of
unfair
action,
an
arbitrator
would
fully
consider
any
unfair
action
including
race
discrimination.
mr.
winn
newman
he
would
consider
it
if
it
came
before
him
in
a
form
of
evidence.
mr.
winn
newman
sure,
that
is
right.
in
this
case,
unfair
charge
is
the
typical
way.
there
are
many
contracts
indeed
that
prohibit
a
grievance
from
being
filed
if
you
allege
race
or
sex
discrimination.
it
is
not
arbitral.
the
general
electric
contract
for
example,
provides
that
you
can
grieve
on
that
but
you
cannot
arbitrate
on
that,
with
the
result
that
our
union
typically
files
a
grievance
and
does
not
allege
race
or
sex
discrimination
because
as
soon
as
we
allege
that,
it
no
longer
becomes
arbitral.
nevertheless,
the
issue
goes
before
the
arbitrator
in
the
context
of
just
cause,
because
whether
you
view
this
as
race
discrimination
or
sex
discrimination,
you
come
out
to
the
same
place
if
the
treatment
is
disparate,
which
is
a
basic
fundamental
of
arbitration.
mr.
winn
newman
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
had
been
many
charges
of
discrimination
filed
under
title
vii
against
this
employer.
there
had
been
eeoc
determinations
against
this
employer.
there
had
been
a
heavily
blocked
plant.
it
can
be
assumed
in
such
cases,
i
think
that
anytime
you
have
discharge
of
black
employees,
this
is
liable
to
be
an
issue.
there
is
some
burden
on
the
employer
to
determine
whether
that
is
a
factor
as
well.
mr.
winn
newman
the
employer,
within
a
normal
course
of
things
gets
a
copy
of
that
determination,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
winn
newman
that
was
after,
of
course
the
grievance
had
been
dropped
and
that
determination
issued.
mr.
winn
newman
yes,
we
would
argue
that
she
can
file
that
claim,
but
she
is
not
required
to
do
so
at
that
time
because
although
some
action
has
been
taken
against
her
and
she
is
no
longer
on
the
payroll,
the
decision
is
still
under
review.
let
me
suggest,
in
this
regard,
that
if
the
employer
treated
this
as
a
final
decision
and
approached
the
subsequent
steps
of
a
grievance
procedure
with
that
in
mind
and
failed
to
approach
the
subsequent
steps
of
a
grievance
procedure
with
an
open
mind,
they
would
be
in
violation
of
section
8(a)(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
suggest
that
that
requires
to
the
extent
that
he
is
required
to
come
to
that
table
with
an
open
mind.
he
cannot
have
come
and
as
you
have
asked
about
earlier,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
sit
there.
he
has
to
come
there
with
an
open
mind
and
give
a
de
novo
review
of
whether
the
conduct
warranted
the
results
that
were
imposed,
whether
it
would
be
to
sustain
it,
reverse
it
or
compromise
it
and
these
grievance
meetings
are
hardly
perfunctory.
mitigating
circumstances
would
be
considered.
other
courts
have
held
as
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
grievance
does
not
occur
until
the
grievance
procedure
is
exhausted.
in
butler
versus
the
teamsters,
514
federal
2nd
442,
for
example,
the
eight
circuit’s
state
of
the
common
sense
indicates
that
there
is
no
accrual
until
all
facts
have
been
learned
including
those
obtained
during
the
grievance
procedure.
that
has
been
upheld
by
a
recent
district
court
in
ohio
and
i
would
like
just
briefly
to
touch
upon
tolling
and
comment
that
if
you
find
the
occurrence
took
place
on
october
25
rather
than
the
third
step
of
the
grievance
procedure,
there
is
substantial
equitable
grounds
to
toll
on
this
case
aside
from
to
be
in
a
court
with
a
federal
policy,
articulated
in
alexander
and
numerous
cases.
it
is
clear
that
non-discrimination
matters
are
going
to
have
to
be
handled
through
the
grievance
procedure.
the
success
rate
is
far
greater
in
arbitration.
they
are
more
than
six
times
as
great
as
before
eeoc
in
discharge
cases.
the
retention
rate
is
more
than
two
times
the
rate
of
people
restored
by
the
nlrb.
we
do
not
have
figures
for
usc.
mr.
winn
newman
in
terms
of
arbitral,
both
parties
have
the
burden
of
bringing
out
all
the
facts
and
discussing
them
with
an
open
mind
as
i
have
said
earlier
and
discussing
them
as
a
grievance
during
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
winn
newman
under
a
general
charge,
you
can
always
come
in
with
evidence
that
there
is
racial
discrimination.
mr.
winn
newman
we
submit
that
the
charge
of
unfair
includes
any
disparity.
mr.
winn
newman
i
think
we
have
met
that
burden
when
a
grievance
is
filed
which
alleges
unfair
treatment.
it
alleges
disparate
treatment
on
all
grounds
including
race.
mr.
winn
newman
no
not
always.
there
might
be
other
factors
involved.
mr.
winn
newman
well,
maybe
absenteeism
or
something
of
that
sort
when
you
have
lots
of
other
claims.
mr.
winn
newman
i
think
when
you
have
a
plan
with
this
kind
of
racial
breakdown
and
within
large
numbers
of
eeoc
charges
that
existed,
you
do
have
a
burden
on
an
employer
to
look
at
race
discrimination
where
he
has
agreed
to
do
so
in
his
affirmative
action
plan
and
conciliation
agreements.
mr.
winn
newman
it
will
not
always
be
disparate
treatment.
there
would
be
other
factors
mitigating
circumstances,
length
of
service
employee
should
get
another
chance
and
good
work
record,
and
so
forth,
but
as
distinguished
in
the
act
that
has
taken
place,
i
cannot
say
it
any
differently,
but
unfair
would
include
race
discrimination.
mr.
winn
newman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
move
that
fletcher
l.
hudson
of
the
state
of
tennessee
be
permitted
to
present
oral
argument
pro
hac
vice
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
respondents.
i
am
satisfied
he
possesses
the
necessary
qualifications.
mr.
winn
newman
yes,
chief
justice.
on
the
point
of
the
--
mr.
winn
newman
well,
we
think
it
is
an
important
issue,
but
in
terms
of
the
long
--
mr.
winn
newman
yes,
but
in
terms
of
the
long-run
effect,
we
think
that
in
interest
of
--
mr.
winn
newman
but
we
think
that
is
what
we
have
said
in
our
briefs.
we
thought
it
was
fully
briefed
there
that
the
180-day
provision
applies
in
this
case
and
that
the
grievance
clearly
is
timely
on
that
basis.
no
question
about
our
thinking
on
that
score.
mr.
winn
newman
no,
we
fully
support
it
in
that
sense
and
did.
i
would
like
to
point
out
though
that
the
complaint
does
allege
race
discrimination,
that
the
company
was
silent
in
its
response.
it
never
argued
that
on
the
argument
that
they
are
now
making.
it
did
not
argue
that
mrs.
guy
had
slept
on
her
rights.
it
did
not
argue
that
it
was
prejudiced
by
the
delay.
we
submit
that
since
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
defense,
that
the
burden
has
the
obligation
to
prove
all
those
elements
and
at
worst,
this
case
should
be
remanded
on
that
matter.
secondly,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
are
not,
in
any
way,
suggesting
here
that
the
employee
should
give
up
the
right
to
utilize
title
vii.
what
we
are
saying
is
that,
for
various
reasons
that
we
get
into
a
brief
and
would
not
be
able
to
get
into
here,
the
employee
maybe
hound
by
the
fact
that
a
grievance
is
pending
and
it
may
disrupt
the
informal
atmosphere
in
terms
of
settling
the
case.
there
would
be
people
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
lawyers
rather
than
trying
to
settle
a
grievance,
with
the
lawyers
taking
over
rather
than
the
industry
relations
people.
congress
clearly
did
not
intend
to
force
people
to
court
as
this
court
had
said
in
alexander
it
intended
to
encourage
people
to
stay
with
the
arbitration
process.
as
far
as
increasing
the
statute
of
limitations
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
us,
this
area
is
clear.
that
a
case
has
already
been
referred
to
and
there
is
minnesota
mining
chase
securities.
i
am
sorry,
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
