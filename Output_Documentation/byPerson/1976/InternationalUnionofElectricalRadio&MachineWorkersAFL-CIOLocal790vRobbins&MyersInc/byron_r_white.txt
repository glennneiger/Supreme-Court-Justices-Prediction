justice
byron
r.
white
was
your
first
approach
presented
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
argued
in
the
courts
below
that
termination
did
not
occur
until
the
grievance
procedure
was
concluded.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
my
knowledge
she
could
not
have
filed
the
charge
between
march
24
and
april
22
of
that
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
congress
was
without
power
to
allow
her
to
do
so,
without
constitutional
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
provision
of
the
constitution
or
what
inhibition
of
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hudson,
could
the
defendant
not
waive
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
a
non-waivable
defense,
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
remarkable.
