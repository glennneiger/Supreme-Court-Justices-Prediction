we
will
hear
arguments
next
in

international
union
against
robbins
and
myers,
and

and
myers.
mr.
goldstein,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
been
talking
so
far,
mr.
goldstein,
about
the
congressional
purposes.
what
are
we
to
decide
the
case
on,
the
congressional
purposes
or
the
language
of
the
statute?
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
a
charge
shall
be
filed
within
90
days
after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred.
that
is
not
ambiguous,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
recently,
when
congress
amended
that,
after
your
case
was
under
way
there
was
no
change
except
changing
it
from
90
days
to
180
days
and
the
language
is
repeated
“shall
be
filed,”
mandatory
language,
“within
180
days
after
the
alleged
unlawful
employment
practice
occurred.”
that
is
on
page
2
and
3
of
your
petition
for
cert.
how
much
emphasis
should
we
place
upon
the
purposes
when
the
language
is
clear,
if
it
is
clear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
not
say
that
though,
does
it?
it
says
90
days
after
the
practice
or
event
has
occurred
and
the
event
was
what,
the
discharge,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
as
justice
stevens’
question
suggested,
if
you
then
were
to
use
other
remedies,
it
might
be
a
long,
long
time
before
the
period
would
begin
to
run
on
your
theory,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
goldstein.

newman.

you
have
anything
further,
mr.
newman?

case
