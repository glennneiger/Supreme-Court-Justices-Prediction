unknown
speaker
did
the
personnel
director
have
taken
an
affirmative
action
at
that
time
or
did
he
just
sit?
unknown
speaker
at
what
time
does
the
pay
stop?
unknown
speaker
i
ask
this,
mr.
newman,
am
i
correct
in
my
understanding
that
on
the
grievance
was
first
filed
there
was
no
claim
at
all
of
racial
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
me
i
miss
understood?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
not
identification
of
it?
unknown
speaker
should
that
make
a
difference,
do
you
think?
in
other
words,
let
us
say
the
grievance
was
specifically
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
some
quite
different
and
unrelated
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
racial
or
sexual
or
age
discrimination
and
that
had
been
processed.
would
that
make
a
difference
in
your
argument?
would
that
not
detract
from
some
of
your
arguments
for
the
point
of
view
of
both
tolling
and
the
finality
of
the
grievance?
unknown
speaker
if
it
had
been
based
on
a
wholly
different
inquiry
than
the
one
that
has
to
be
undertaken
if
there
is
a
claim
of
racial
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
grievance
procedure,
was
there
focus
on
racial
discrimination
at
all?
unknown
speaker
it
would
really
be
unnoticed
if
there
is
no
focus
and
no
inquiry
into
racial
discrimination
whatsoever
during
this
grievance
procedure.
there
was
no
notice
to
the
company
of
any
such
claim.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is
not
in
the
record,
we
do
not
have
it.
unknown
speaker
he
probably
would
have
if
it
were
not
even
suggested
to
him
that
that
might
have
been
the
reason
for
the
discharge,
would
he?
unknown
speaker
yes,
if
it
came
before
him.
unknown
speaker
i
think
perhaps
you
understand
what
was
behind
my
question
in
any
event.
if
there
is
no
notice
to
the
employer
at
all
that
this
is
going
to
turn
ultimately
to
a
claim
under
section
7
then
perhaps
there
is
some
of
the
force
of
your
argument
to
disparity.
unknown
speaker
when
you
are
with
the
eeoc,
it
is
right
to
sue
latter
concluding
that
there
was
no
racial
discrimination.
was
the
employer
informed
of
that
circumstance?
unknown
speaker
so
the
employer
was
entitled
to
draw
some
inferences
at
that
time
as
to
status
of
the
matter,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
newman,
if
the
petitioner
was
discharged
on
october
25,
could
she
have
filed
a
claim
immediately
on
october
26
with
eeoc?
unknown
speaker
mr.
newman,
let
me
interrupt
because
i
am
troubled
by
the
same
points
that,
apparently,
justice
stewart
had
in
mind.
for
your
argument
really
to
be
sound,
should
you
not
also
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
grievance
procedure
and
the
arbitration
procedure
focused
on
the
charge
of
discrimination?
is
that
not
a
part
of
what
judge
tuttle
had
in
mind
in
culpepper
and
the
other
cases
in
appellate
court,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
i
have
not
reread
those
cases,
but
if
you
do
not
have
that,
does
your
argument
really
hold
water?
the
second
part
of
my
question,
just
to
have
it
all
out
is,
if
that
is
relevant,
who
should
have
the
burden
of
showing
whether
the
arbitration
did
involve
racial
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
saying
the
employer
should
have
the
burden
of
showing
under
a
general
charge
to
always
come
in
with
evidence
that
there
was
no
racial
motivation.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
but
the
question,
if
it
is
relevant
to
know
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
involved
racial
discrimination
who
should
the
judge
put
the
burden
on
to
explain
whether
or
not
that
was
part
of
the
arbitration
process?
here,
we
have
a
silent
record,
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
in
terms
of
that
view,
bring
it
out
before
the
arbitrary.
unknown
speaker
that
is
going
to
be
in
every
single
grievance
involving
a
firing,
is
it
not?
is
that
not
always
going
to
be
the
claim,
that
it
is
unfair?
unknown
speaker
i
cannot
think
of
any
because
that
is
such
a
broad
generic
covering
the
waterfront
term,
that
is
what
it
is
always
going
to
be,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
employee
and
the
grievers
are
never
going
to
say
he
was
fired
for
absenteeism.
he
is
going
to
say
“i
was
fired
unfairly.”
then
the
employer
is
going
to
respond,
well,
“the
fact
is,
you
were
fired
for
absenteeism.”
so,
is
that
not
always
going
to
be
generic
with
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
answer
to
justice
stewart’s
question?
unknown
speaker
or
to
justice
stevens,
because
i
do
not
think
you
have
answered
either
one
of
them.
is
that
not
always
going
to
be
a
claim
of
disparate
treatment?
unknown
speaker
clearly,
if
it
would
have
gone
to
arbitration,
that
would
have
been
an
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
hudson
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
filing
with
the
eeoc
to
try
and
seek
voluntary
adjustment
of
the
matter
without
resort
to
the
courts
and
if
that
is
correct,
is
it
not
consistent
with
that
purpose
also
to
exhaust
arbitration
first?
unknown
speaker
very
simply
stated,
the
purpose
is
to
try
and
forestall
litigation,
to
try
to
make
it
unnecessary
to
go
to
court,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
the
eeoc
has
no
power
other
than
to
try
and
get
the
parties
to
work
it
out,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hudson,
does
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
this
case
contain
any
provisions
with
respect
to
the
time
periods
or
with
respect
to
concluding
grievance
proceedings
or
the
filing
of
grievance
proceedings
or
they
going
to
arbitration,
is
there
a
schedule
of
limitation
period
within
that
bargaining
agreement
with
itself?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
time
limitation
on
filing
the
initial
grievance?
unknown
speaker
after
the
final
step,
arbitration
must
be
initiated
within
10
days.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hudson,
you
just
referred
to
the
180-day
provision.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
you
are
not
receding
from
your
position
that
the
amendment
does
not
apply
to
this
claim
as
filed.
unknown
speaker
is
it
true,
however,
that
when
the
amendment
was
effected,
she
still
could
have
filed
the
day
after
the
amendment
and
then
on
time,
and
you
would
have
no
defense
to
that
filing?
unknown
speaker
despite
the
language
of
the
amendment?
unknown
speaker
are
you
not
really
saying
that
none
of
the
amendment
applies
to
all
occurrences
that
took
place
after
the
amendment?
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
driven
to
the
position
that
her
charge
and
her
incident
were
completely
extinguished
and
even
if
she
had
not
filed
the
charge
and
even
though
it
was
within
180
days,
she
could
not
now
file
the
charge?
unknown
speaker
in
a
way,
you
can
waive
the
fifth
amendment,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
true
as
a
matter
of
statute,
but
what
authorities
do
you
rely
on
for
the
proposition
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
prevent
congress
from
accomplishing
this
if
they
chose
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
and
we
have
to
accept
all
those
propositions
to
agree
with
you.
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
sixth
circuit
refused
to
reach
this
question
on
the
ground
of
amicus.
i
gather
eeoc
is
amicus.
it
had
suggested
that
it
had
not
been
tendered
by
the
petitioners.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
said,
but
it
was
tendered
by
eeoc
as
amicus.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
support
that
allegation.
unknown
speaker
the
eeoc
would
not
have
taken
it.
that
is
a
lie,
is
it
not?
she
does
not
know
whether
they
would
or
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hudson,
let
me
get
back
in
my
question
in
response
to
this
other
ones.
suppose
the
occurrence
took
place
30
days
before
the
’72
amendment,
how
long
would
she
have
to
file,
60
or
120
days?
unknown
speaker
despite
the
interposition
of
the
’72
amendment.
unknown
speaker
the
limitation
is
a
condition
to
the
right
itself.
you
could
not
suggest
that
the
180
days
would
be
applicable,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
is
it
really
accurate
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
this
issue?
judge
white’s
opinion
says
that
there
is
a
new
issue
which
was
not
raised
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
district
court.
i
am
looking
at
pages
8a
and
9a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
then
he
goes
along
and
in
two
or
three
or
four
short
paragraphs
he
does
discuss
the
issue
and
dispose
of
it,
does
he
not?
unknown
speaker
that
does
deal
with
the
issue
and
dispose
of
it
on
the
merits.
do
you
give
it
the
same
reading
as
i
do?
unknown
speaker
he
ends
up
the
discussion
with
“the
subsequent
increase
of
time
to
file
a
charge
enacted
by
congress
could
not
revive
plaintiff’s
claim
which
have
previously
been
barred
and
extinguished.
that
seems
to
me,
a
fairly
unambiguous
conclusion.
it
does
not
say
“if
we
did
decide
the
issue,
we
would
decide
it
that
way.”
unknown
speaker
judge
edward’s
dissent
is
squarely
on
the
180
days,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
your
side
does
not
seem
to
address
the
180
days.
unknown
speaker
actually,
if
you
were
right
on
the
180
days,
we
would
not
have
to
reach
any
of
these.
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
win
your
lawsuits,
you
might
try
to
help
us
with
the
180
days.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
disagree
with
the
argument
made
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
united
states?
