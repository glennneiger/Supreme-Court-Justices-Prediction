justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case,
a
dortha
guy
was
filed
fired
by
her
employer
when
she
failed
to
returned
to
work
properly
following
a
sick
leave.
she
filed
a
grievance
alleging
that
the
company's
action
had
been
unfair
and
this
grievance
was
resolved
against
her.
she
then
filed
a
charge
of
racial
discrimination
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1974
with
the
eeoc.
a
statute
of
that
time
required
that
such
claims
be
filed
within
90
days
of
the
allegedly
discriminatory
act.
ms.
guy's
claim
was
filed
108
days
after
she
was
fired
although
less
than
90
days
after
company
rejected
her
grievance.
ms.
guy
then
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
tennessee.
that
court
dismissed
her
action.
she
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
that
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
finding
that
she
was
not
entitled
to
bring
this
suit.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
fact
that
ms.
guy
resorted
to
her
independent
right
to
file
a
grievance
with
the
company
did
not
extend
the
90-day
period
for
filing
a
claim
under
title
vii.
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion,
however,
that
the
subsequent
change
in
the
period
from
90
to
180
days
does
not
help
mrs.
guy.
we
find
that
the
language
of
the
statute
gives
her
the
benefit
of
the
180-day
period
since
she
did
filed
her
claim
with
the
eeoc
within
180
days
of
the
date
she
was
fired.
we
therefore,
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
stevens
have
file
a
separate
statement
in
which
they
agree
with
our
disposition
of
180-day
limitation
issue
but
would
not
address
the
other
issues
which
we
decide.
