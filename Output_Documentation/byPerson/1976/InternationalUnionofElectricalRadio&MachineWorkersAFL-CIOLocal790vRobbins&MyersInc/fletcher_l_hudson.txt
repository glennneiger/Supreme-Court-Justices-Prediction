mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
we
disagree
with
the
petitioners
here
as
to
the
issue
before
this
court.
we
submit
that
the
issues
here
are
not
as
complicated
and
complex
as
they
have
made
it
out
in
their
argument.
there
was
only
one
issue
decided
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
there
was
only
one
issue
that
was
briefed
on
the
merits
by
both
parties
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
there
was
only
one
issue
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
issue
was
simply
whether
or
not
the
filing
of
a
grievance
under
collective
bargaining
contract
operates
to
sustain
or
toll
the
time
for
filing
the
charge
with
the
eeoc.
we
contend
that
this
is
the
only
issue
that
is
properly
before
this
court.
now,
the
facts
as
have
been
noted
are
basically
undisputed
and
simple.
this
employee
was
discharged
on
october
25
and
she
did
not
file
a
charge
until
108
days
from
the
date
of
her
discharge.
now,
she
filed
a
grievance
or
had
a
grievance
filed
on
her
behalf
that
alleged
the
violation
of
the
contract
as
she
claimed
the
discharge
was
unfair.
the
union
decided
not
to
take
this
case
to
arbitration
and
nothing
happened
on
this
grievance
from
the
date
it
was
denied
by
the
employer.
nothing
happened
after
that
point
and
nothing
happened
until
the
employee
filed
a
charge
with
eeoc.
it
is
interesting
to
note
here
that
the
plaintiff,
when
she
filed
her
case
in
the
district
court,
alleged
two
claims.
she
alleged
a
claim
under
1866
civil
rights
act
and
she
alleged
a
claim
under
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
in
the
argument
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
claim
under
the
1866
civil
rights
act,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted,
the
plaintiff
defended
her
failure
to
file
her
lawsuit
within
the
one
year
state
statute
of
limitations
on
the
ground
that
the
time
of
her
filing
of
the
eeoc
charge
had
tolled
the
time
for
her
filing
this
lawsuit
under
1866.
in
the
argument
on
the
dismissal
or
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
title
vii
claim,
she
took
the
position
and
the
sole
position
that
the
filing
of
the
grievance
tolled
the
time
for
filing
the
charge
with
eeoc.
the
district
court
rejected
these
arguments
and
dismissed
both
of
these
claims.
the
plaintiff
appealed
the
claim
under
title
vii
and
as
i
noted
the
court
of
appeals
deciding
the
issue
of
tolling
and
relying
on
this
court’s
decision
in
alexander
and
in
johnson,
affirmed
the
dismissal
by
the
district
court.
the
petitioners
and
the
respondents
in
this
case
basically
agree
on
the
test
that
should
be
applied
by
this
court
in
deciding
this
issue.
and
the
test
is
whether
or
not
the
failure
to
apply
tolling
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
federal
policy
underlying
the
cause
of
action
under
consideration.
we
both
agree
that
this
is
the
basic
test
that
should
apply.
now,
what
we
disagree
on
here
are
two
things.
number
one,
what
is
this
federal
policy
and
number
two
would
it
be
inconsistent
with
this
federal
policy
to
refuse
to
apply
tolling?
this
court
in
alexander
and
in
johnson
had
several
things
to
say
about
this
federal
policy
that
we
contend
should
control
the
answer
to
the
first
question.
this
court
stated
that
the
underlying
policy
of
title
vii
was
to
provide
the
title
vii
remedies
as
parallel
and
overlapping
to
any
other
remedies
that
might
be
available.
the
court
also
stated
that
the
policy
underlying
title
vii
was
that
the
eeoc
and
the
court
should
have
the
preferred
role
in
resolving
claims
of
discrimination
and
not
arbitrators
and
grievance
procedures.
the
court
stated
that
the
procedures
of
title
vii
should
be
given
full
play
and
should
not
be
made
dependent
on
what
might
happen
in
a
grievance
or
arbitration
procedure.
the
court
also
noted
in
alexander
that
the
underlying
policy
of
title
vii
was
that
precise
jurisdictional
prerequisites
must
be
met
before
an
individual
will
be
able
to
assert
a
claim
under
title
vii.
and
one
of
these
prerequisites
is
the
timely
filing
of
a
charge
with
eeoc.
now,
we
can
see
nothing
inconsistent
with
these
policies
to
refuse
to
apply
tolling
in
this
case.
and
we
have
heard
nothing
from
the
petitioners
that
suggests
that
there
is
anything
inconsistent
with
these
policies
to
require
this
employee
to
file
her
charge
within
90
days.
the
basic
position
of
the
petitioner
seem
to
be
that
it
would
be
preferable
to
sustain
title
vii
remedies
and
the
remedies
under
title
vii
so
that
the
arbitration
and
grievance
procedure
will
be
given
a
chance
to
work.
they
basically
take
the
position
that
these
two
remedies
are
so
interrelated
and
dependent
that
what
happens
in
the
pursuit
of
one
remedy
will
necessarily
affect
what
happens
in
another.
these
same
arguments
were
made
to
this
court
in
alexander
and
in
johnson
and
were
rejected
by
this
court.
their
perusable
argument
is
that,
to
require
an
employee
to
file
a
grievance
or
to
file
an
eeoc
charge
while
a
grievance
is
pending
would
in
some
way
interfere
with
the
national
policy
that
encourages
the
settlement
of
labor
disputes,
the
grievance
and
arbitration.
now,
we
submit
that
this
has
not
been
shown
to
be
the
case
or
that
we
take
the
position
that
there
would
be
no
substantial
interference
with
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
to
require
an
employee
to
file
an
eeoc
charge
within
180
days
under
the
new
law.
in
any
event,
we
take
the
position
that
is
not
the
policy
underlying
the
national
labor
laws
that
they
should
be
considered
here
is
the
policies
underlying
title
vii
that
should
control
whether
or
not
tolling
should
apply.
the
petitioners
in
their
brief,
took
the
position
that
allowing
tolling
to
take
place
will
encourage
the
settlement
of
disputes
that
will
discourage
the
filing
of
charges
with
the
eeoc
and
would
cut
down
on
the
work
of
the
eeoc.
this
court
in
alexander
answered
this
argument
by
stating
that
congress
intended
for
the
commission
and
the
courts
to
handle
claims
of
discrimination
and
not
arbitrators.
contrary
to
this
argument,
congress
did
not
intend
to
discourage
charges
with
the
eeoc.
they
intended
to
encourage
charges
and
we
see
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
policies
underlying
title
vii
to
require
an
employee
to
file
a
charge
with
eeoc.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
we
do
not
feel
it
is
consistent
with
that
purpose
to
exhaust
arbitration
because
arbitration
and
grievance
procedures
are
basically
between
unions
and
companies.
often
times
the
unions
are
alleged
as
the
perpetrators
to
discrimination
with
the
company
and
they
were
in
this
case.
the
purposes
underlying
title
vii
and
the
filing
of
the
charge
are
to
have
the
commission’s
conciliation
procedures
to
take
effect.
and
the
fact
that
other
efforts
are
taking
place
--
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
i
do
not
necessarily
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
bring
into
play
the
procedures
under
title
vii,
to
try
to
bring
about
conciliation.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
is
correct,
but
we
feel
that
the
basic
argument
that
this
tolling
will
allow
for
the
settlement
of
disputes
is
not
an
argument
in
support
of
tolling
because
the
basic
purpose
of
title
vii
is
to
have
the
eeoc
and
the
courts
handle
these
cases
and
not
unions
and
employers
who
are
often
times
together
the
perpetrators
of
discrimination.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
there
is
a
time
limit
in
which
a
party
has
to
take
a
grievance
from
the
final
step
and
the
third
step
to
arbitration.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
i
think
it
is
10
days
in
this
case.
i
do
not
recall
it.
ten
to
fifteen
days.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
there
is
a
time
limit
on
filing
the
initial
grievance
of
five
days.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
the
request
for
arbitration
must
be
initiated
within
10
days.
many
times,
under
any
contract
and
under
this
contract,
there
is
no
time
limit
on
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
arbitrator
rendered
the
final
decision.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
particular
plant
we
have
one
grievance
go
to
arbitration
and
we
never
got
an
answer
from
the
arbitrator.
it
is
still
pending.
it
has
been
pending
for
about
five
years.
this
was
one
of
the
points
i
wish
to
make,
that
these
collective
bargaining
contracts
are
all
different.
their
negotiations
or
contracts
between
unions
and
companies
with
different
time
limits
for
taking
grievances
to
arbitrations,
taking
the
filing
of
the
grievances
and
what
has
to
be
alleged
and
the
procedures
in
having
these
grievances.
to
allow
tolling
will
cause
complicated
and
complex
issues
that
will
have
to
be
decided
by
the
eeoc
and
the
courts.
and
their
work
in
trying
to
decide
these
issues,
we
feel,
would
detract
from
their
principle
objective
of
trying
to
eliminate
racial
discrimination.
as
mr.
goldstein
stated,
this
grievance
procedure
involved
here
is
relatively
short.
in
most
grievance
procedures,
you
know
within
a
very
short
period
of
time
whether
or
not
this
grievance
procedure
will
bring
about
a
settlement
of
your
particular
claim.
we
contend
that
180
days
is
ample
time
for
an
employee
to
know
whether
or
not
their
grievance
will
bring
about
an
adjustment.
they
have
plenty
of
time
even
if
they
wanted
to
wait
until
after
the
grievance
procedure
to
file
a
claim
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
can
develop
procedures
of
deferrals,
such
as
the
procedures
developed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
will
minimize
the
meaning
of
the
problems
the
petitioners
contend
will
take
place
if
tolling
is
not
permitted
to
occur.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
yes.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
our
position
is
that
she
could
not
have
filed
after
the
amendments
pertained
effective.
on
march
24,
1972,
it
was
still
within
180
days
from
the
date
of
her
discharge,
but
we
contend
that
the
congress
has
no
power
to
give
her
the
right
to
file
a
charge
over
a
claim
that
has
been
extinguished
or
has
never
come
into
existence.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
the
language
of
the
amendment
applies
to
all
charges
filed
thereafter
and
all
pending
charges.
if
she
had
filed
a
charge
thereafter,
we
contend
that
that
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
congress
to
give
her
this
right
to
file
a
charge
if
it
occurred
more
than
90
days
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
amendment.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
is
correct.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
she
could
not
have
filed
a
charge.
that
is
our
first
position
on
that.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
without
constitutional
power.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
we
contend
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
due
process
of
law
that
this
is
a
situation
that
as
of
the
date
of
the
amendments,
march
24,
there
was
no
right
in
existence
and
no
liability
in
existence
as
of
that
date.
congress
cannot
legislate
rights
and
liabilities
based
on
conduct
that
occurred
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
this
amendment.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
we
feel
like
the
defendant
could
not
waive
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
yes.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
well,
we
would
contend
that
the
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
this
claim
because
no
charge
was
filed
and
the
filing
of
a
charge
is
a
prerequisite
to
the
very
existence
of
the
right
and
liability.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
we
rely
on
this
court’s
decision
in
the
danzer
case
that
was
cited
in
our
brief,
that
has
later
been
distinguished
in
other
situations
where
the
statute
of
limitations
goes
to
the
remedy
only
and
not
to
the
right.
but,
we
contend
that
the
danzer
decision
that
we
have
cited
stands
for
this
proposition.
and
we
also
contend
that
even
if
congress
did
have
the
power
to
legislate
these
rights,
they
did
not
legislate
the
rights
in
this
case
because
the
1972
amendments
do
not
apply
to
this
situation.
they
can
only
apply
if
this
charge
was
pending
and
this
charge
was
not
pending.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
approximately,
yes.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
is
correct.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
is
our
position
and
we
would
also
want
to
point
out
--
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
yes
and
you
also
have
to
decide
that
you
have
this
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
our
position
is
that
it
was
not
before
the
court
because
a
party
did
not
raise
the
issue.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
could
not
in
the
district
court.
it
was
not
before
the
district
court
for
decision.
it
was
not
briefed
on
the
merits
by
the
parties
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
would
also
point
out
that
this
employee,
when
she
filed
her
charge
on
february,
stated
that
the
most
recent
date
of
discrimination
was
january
29.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
there
has
nothing
ever
been
suggested
any
discrimination
occurred
on
that
dateif
she
had
not
misrepresented
this
fact—
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
well,
under
their
procedures,
we
have
to
assume
they
would
not.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
we
contend
that
she
would
have
90
days
to
file,
or
60
more
days.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
well,
this
argument,
i
am
not
frankly
solid
on
this.
i
cannot
really
answer
your
question
directly.
from
a
constitutional
stand
point,
maybe
that
she
could
file
180
days
later,
but
i
will
have
to
take
the
position
that
to
be
consistent
that
she
could
not
file
after
60
days.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
is
correct.
in
the
first
part
of
that
decision,
the
attempts
of
making
clear
that
there
was
only
one
issue
for
decision.
and
he
does
go
ahead
and
decided
the
issue
without
the
benefit
of
the
respondent’s
argument
on
the
merits
to
that
issue.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
they
discussed
the
issue.
i
do
not
feel
that
they
decided
the
issue.
i
do
not
feel
that
they
actually
decided
the
issue.
they
said,
in
effect,
that
“if
we
were
to
decide
this
issue
we
would
decide
such
and
such”
and
that
is
the
basis
of
their
decision.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
maybe
true,
your
honor,
it
is
really
unclear.
mr.
fletcher
l.
hudson
that
is
a
point
that,
i
think,
should
be
noted.judge
edward’s
dissent
states
that
they
should
not
decide
the
issue
but
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
and
let
the
district
court
decide
it.
in
effect,
that
is
his
dissent,
that
they
should
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court.
i
would
like
to
say,
concerning
the
argument
that
the
discharge
was
not
a
final
act
until
the
termination
of
the
grievance
procedure.
as
i
stated
earlier,
there
is
also
a
question
here
of
whether
of
not
this
issue
is
properly
before
the
court.
we
contend
that
this
issue
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
brief
to
this
court.
under
this
court’s
rules
and
policies,
it
should
not
be
considered
since
it
was
not
considered
by
the
courts
below.
but
in
any
event,
we
contend
that
a
discharge
of
an
employee
is
a
final
and
completed
act.
it
was
a
final
and
completed
act
in
this
particular
case.
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
done.
the
only
thing
left
to
be
done
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
company
would
change
its
mind.
now,
the
company
still
has
this
question.
they
can
still
change
their
mind,
but
that
does
not
make
the
discharge,
not
a
final
completed
act.
the
denial
of
the
grievance
was
also
a
final
act
and
completed.
it
was
a
separate
act.
the
employee
could
have
filed
eeoc
charge
over
the
denial
of
the
grievance.
the
employee
filed
a
charge
over
the
discharge
of
the
employee.
and
it
should
be
noted
also
that
plaintiff’s
complaint
in
the
district
court
alleged
that
this
discharge
occurred
on
october
25,
1971.
so
we
contend
that
this
argument
does
not
lend
any
assistance
to
the
petitioner’s
case
here.
in
conclusion,
we
contend
that
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
tolling
should
apply.
and
based
on
the
policies
of
this
court,
we
contend
it
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
policies
underlying
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
refuse
to
apply
tolling.
and
since
it
would
not
be
inconsistent,
we
contend
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
