justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
goldstein,
did
she
have
a
right
of
further
review
within
the
grievance
machinery?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
not
be
appropriate
to
postpone
the
complete
denial
of
her
contractual
rights
or
termination
of
her
contractual
rights
until
the
time
in
which
she
could
obtain
review
expired?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
your
position
or
is
it
whenever
they
--
i
do
not
see
how
to
differentiate
in
other
words
between
the
denial
after
the
third
stage
and
the
initial
discharge
because
under
your
theory
neither
of
those
was
the
expiration
of
the
contractual
relationship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
hudson,
i
gather
on
your
submission,
the
90
days
run
out
on
january
25?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
was
a
complaint
file
on
february
10?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say,
i
gather,
that
the
eeoc
could
not
accept
it
on
february
10
the
complaint
which,
in
fact,
eeoc
did
accept
that
you
say
had
no
authority
to,
and
therefore,
the
complaint
filed
on
february
10,
although
still
with
the
commission
on
march
24,
was
not
pending
for
the
purposes
of
the
â€˜72
to
amendments.
