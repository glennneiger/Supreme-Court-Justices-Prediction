mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
emphasize
the
importance
in
reversing
the
sixth
circuit
from
the
perspective
of
providing
fairness
to
the
victims
of
employment
discrimination
and
encouraging
effective
implementation
of
the
public
policy
of
achieving
equal
employment
opportunity.
mr.
newman
will
argue
from
the
perspective
of
encouraging
voluntary
compliance
and
incorporating
equal
employment
opportunity
into
the
law
of
the
shops.
this
case
arises
from
a
straight-forward
set
of
undisputed
facts.
mrs.
guy,
a
black
woman,
was
originally
hired
by
robbins
and
myers
on
november
1,
1968.
from
october
19
through
october
24,
1971,
mrs.
guy
was
absent
due
to
illness.
that
illness
was
excused
by
the
company.
on
october
25,
mrs.
guy
did
not
return
to
work.
she
was
immediately
discharged.
within
two
days,
she
caused
a
review
to
be
undertaken
of
her
discharge
by
filing
a
grievance,
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
between
the
union
and
the
company.
within
22
days,
on
november
18,
1971,
the
personnel
director
after
reviewing
the
decision
denied
her
grievance.
within
84
days
of
that
decision,
on
february
10,
1972,
mrs.
guy
filed
a
charge
with
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
that
charge
was
filed
108
days
after
the
initial
company
decision
to
discharge
mrs.
guy.
herein,
lays
the
case.
the
lower
courts
held
that
the
90-day
limitations
period
began
to
run
from
october
25,
1971,
the
date
of
the
initial
company
decision
to
discharge
mrs.
guy.
that
90-day
provision
was
amended
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972
to
180
days,
but
petitioners
here
raise
three
grounds
why
mrs.
guy’s
charge
should
be
treated
as
timely
filed.
the
first
one
is,
that
the
final
occurrence
of
the
unlawful
act
did
not
occur
until
november
18,
1971
when
the
personnel
director
of
the
company
last
acted
pursuant
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
company
and
mrs.
guy.
two,
the
petitioners
submit
that
the
filing
of
a
grievance
towards
the
running
of
the
period
of
limitations
during
the
resort
to
the
grievance
procedure
and
lastly,
the
petitioners
submit
that
the
180-day
period
provided
by
the
1972
amendment
applies
to
this
case.
the
first
ground
that
the
practice
had
not
occurred
until
november
18
when
the
personnel
director
of
the
company
affirmed
the
initial
decision
to
discharge
mrs.
guy
does
not
involve
any
analysis
of
legislative
history
or
any
review
of
this
court’s
seminal
decisions
in
johnson
v.
rea
and
alexander
v.
gardner-denver.
rather
the
issue
is
as
the
seventh
circuit
stated
in
moore
v.
sunbeam
corp.,
when
was
the
last
occurrence
of
the
unlawful
act?
we
submit
that
that
occurrence
was
when
the
personnel
director
last
acted
under
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
with
mrs.
guy.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
your
honor,
the
contract
is
set
out
i
think
in
37a
and
38a
of
the
appendix
which
requires
the
personnel
director
to
make
a
decision
within
10
days
of
the
submission
of
a
third-step
grievance
to
him.
when
the
company
initially
made
its
decision
to
discharge
mrs.
guy,
the
situation
was
analogous
to
an
anticipatory
contract
breach.
the
contract
between
mrs.
guy
and
the
company
was
not
thereby
terminated.
she
had
a
right
to
seek
review
of
the
decision
to
discharge
her
by
filing
a
grievance
and
proceeding
to
a
conference
with
her
general
foreman
and
the
personnel
director
of
the
company.
during
these
three
steps
of
intra
company
review,
the
company
had
sole
power
to
reverse
its
initial
decision,
reinstate
mrs.
guy
and
cure
the
breach
of
contract.
to
treat
the
denial
of
her
grievance
by
the
company
as
the
final
occurrence
which
triggers
the
running
of
the
limitations
period,
within
which
the
worker
must
file
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
or
courts
with
common
sense.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
she
had
the
right
to
proceed
to
arbitration.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
yes,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
could
be
that
the
period
here
have
been
told
until
november
28
since
the
union
had
10
days
to
indicate
whether
they
were
going
to
take
their
option
and
proceed
to
arbitration.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
i
think,
mr.
justice
stevens,
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
november
28
than
november
18
when
the
decision
was
made
not
to
proceed
to
arbitration,
but
it
was
unnecessary
to
reach
that
question
here.
when
the
agreement
for
which
you
bargained
provides
protection
against
discrimination
in
employment
and
also
provides
an
accessible
means
of
redress,
it
is
understandable
that
a
worker
like
mrs.
guy
who
was
also
a
union
steward
would
turn
first
to
her
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
support
of
her
fellow
workers
before
turning
to
the
government.
accordingly,
petitioner,
guy’s
charge
was
timely
filed
regardless
of
whether
congress
intended
that
the
limitation
period
could
be
affected
by
equitable
consideration
such
as
tolling.
however,
an
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
the
congressional
policies
effectuated
by
title
vii
and
this
court’s
opinion
in
alexander
v.
gardner-denver
company,
all
support
tolling
the
limitations
period
during
resort
to
the
grievance
procedure.
the
sixth
circuit’s
and
respondent’s
reliance
on
johnson
v.
rea
is
misplaced.
in
johnson,
this
court
held
that
federal
actions
undertaken
pursuant
to
section
1981
and
title
vii
were
independent,
separate
and
distinct
and
stated
that
the
filing
of
an
eeoc
charge
does
not
necessarily
toll
the
limitations
period
for
filing
a
1981
action.
the
court
in
comparing
the
remedies
available
under
1981
and
title
vii,
examined
each
and
said
that
each
has
its
advantages
and
each
has
its
disadvantages.
here,
however,
there
is
no
such
parity
of
judicial
enforceable
remedies.
the
grievance
procedure
is
conciliatory
and
pragmatic,
dear
does
this
court
have
said
to
the
law
of
the
shot,
not
the
law
of
the
land.
second,
in
johnson
the
court
looked
to
the
state
tolling
law.
here,
the
only
question
is
the
application
of
a
federal
limitations
period.
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
limitation
period
is
tolled
or
not
is
not
a
semantic
question.
it
is
not
a
determination
of
whether
the
period
is
procedural
or
substantive.
rather,
it
is
a
question
of
examining
what
it
the
intent
of
congress.
here,
congress
made
it
clear
in
several
ways,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
equal
employment
opportunity
act
that
the
limitations
periods
in
706
and
specifically
706(e)
were
to
be
interpreted
so
“as
to
give
persons
the
maximum
benefit
of
the
law.”
the
congress
specifically
approved
this
court’s
flexible
interpretations
of
the
limitations
period
for
deferral
to
state,
the
employment
agencies
in
love
v.
pullman
company
and
it
specifically
approved
other
equitable
considerations
such
as
the
notion
of
a
continuing
violation.
lastly,
the
court
in
johnson
stated
that
the
adoption
of
the
state
tolling
principles
was
not
inconsistent
in
that
case
with
federal
policies
since
the
court
pointed
out
little
was
at
stake
and
here,
there
is
much
at
stake.
the
accommodation
with
the
effective
utilization
of
the
system
for
an
industrial
self
government
to
achieve
equal
employment
opportunity,
the
grievance
machinery
is
not
an
alternative
judicial
remedy.
rather,
it
is
a
basic
component
of
industrial
self
government
and
a
prime
mechanism
by
which
fair
employment
practices
must
be
incorporated
into
american
industry
if
the
goal
of
equal
employment
opportunity
is
to
be
achieved.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
no,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
we
would
submit
that
that
language
speaks
to
the
amount
of
time
someone
would
have
to
file
a
charge
once
the
limitation
period
begins
to
run.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
under
our
first
theory,
we
would
say
that
the
last
occurrence
was
not
until
the
termination
of
the
review
procedure
of
the
initial
decision
to
discharge
which
occurred
on
november
18
when
the
personnel
director
of
the
company
denied
mrs.
guy’s
third-step
grievance.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
in
american
industry
is
generally
geared
to
a
very
short
period
of
time
approximately,
as
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
union,
90%
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
have
provisions
such
as
the
one
here
where
the
maximum
period
of
time
for
the
decision
to
go
to
arbitration
could
be
35
days.
also,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
in
our
reply
brief
we
pointed
to
the
statute
limitations
periods
that
were
discussed
in
the
burnett
case
and
also
in
the
midstate
case
which
were
as
mandatory
as
the
statute
in
this
case,
but
nevertheless,
the
court
said
that
those
mandatory
time
periods
did
not
preclude
the
application
of
equitable
considerations
to
a
decision
as
to
when
those
time
periods
would
begin
to
run.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
mr.
justice
white,
the
argument
which
basically
depends
upon
the
moore
v.
sunbeam
corp.
was
stated
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
pertinent
language
in
moore
v.
sunbeam
corp.
was
cited
to
the
sixth
circuit.
we
did
not
articulate
it
as
a
separate
argument
as
we
do.
mr.
barry
l.
goldstein
no,
mr.
justice
white,
we
did
not.
we
just
sited
the
pertinent
language
in
moore
v.
sunbeam
corp.
to
the
sixth
circuit.
while
mr.
newman
will
discuss
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
at
some
length,
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
contrary
to
respondent’s
argument,
why
the
court’s
opinion
in
alexander
requires
tolling.
in
alexander,
the
court
considered
the
conflict
or
rather
the
accommodation
of
two
paramount
federal
policies,
fair
employment
practices
and
industrial
self
government.
the
court
in
alexander,
by
its
ruling,
was
pointing
out
that
the
procedure
for
the
resort
to
the
law
of
the
shot
and
the
law
of
the
land
should
supplement
each
other.
repeatedly,
the
court
pointed
out
that
a
proper
grievance
arbitration
procedure
could
effectively
assist
in
implementing
title
vii
and
even
indicated
that
under
certain
circumstances
evidence
gathered
in
that
process
could
be
used
by
the
district
court.
in
conclusion,
this
court
has
delineated
at
some
length
the
law
enforcing
the
policy
of
equal
employment.
in
griggs
and
albemarle
paper
company,
unlawful
practices
were
defined.
in
albemarle
paper
company
in
franks
v.
bowman
transportation
company,
the
requirements
for
adequate
remedy
discussed.
in
this
case,
the
court
has
the
opportunity
by
reversing
the
sixth
circuit
to
encourage
the
full
implementation
of
these
decisions
into
the
law
of
the
shot
where
with
the
continued
spur
of
court
decisions
make
the
goal
of
equal
employment
opportunity
a
reality.
