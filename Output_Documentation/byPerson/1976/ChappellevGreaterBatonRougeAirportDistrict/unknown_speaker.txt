unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
a
priority
counsel
does
the
greater
baton
rouge
airport
district
exercise?
does
it
exercise
general
governmental
authority,
or
is
a
kind
of
specialized
district.
unknown
speaker
why
would
not
that
be
governed
by
those
scheuer
and
calero
cases
which
we
handed
down
about
three
or
four
years
ago,
which
is
i
noticed
neither
party’s
cites
in
their
briefs,
where
we
said
in
the
case
of
the
special
improvement
district,
you
have
the
one
man,
one
board
rule
and
the
property
requirements
did
not
apply.
unknown
speaker
well
these
were
in
that
sense
public
bodies,
but
i
think
they
were
described
as
kind
of
special
use
districts
rather
than
districts
having
general
governmental
powers.
unknown
speaker
well
we
have
held,
we
have
held
just
in
the
past
couple
of
years,
residency
requirements
for
running
for
office
of
five
and
ten
years
in
length,
how
would
you
distinguish
those,
if
every
citizen
has
a
right
to
be
considered
for
public
office?
unknown
speaker
well
i
am
talking
about
a
new
hampshire
law,
which
we
upheld
about
two
or
three
years
ago,
but
does
that
require
15-year
residency
requirement
before
you
could
run
for
governed.
now
that
certainly
is
not
based
--
that
is
not
kind
of
time
period
that
should
talking
about
eliminating
fraudulent
voting
and
that
is
just
a
long
term
attachment
of
the
state
that
was
required
and
we
upheld
it.
unknown
speaker
but,
it
does
not
have
the
same
motivation
or
at
least
something
in
common
with
the
residency
requirement
that
is
an
attachment
to
more
or
less
permanent
relationship
to
the
community.
unknown
speaker
now
he
question
is
whether
it
is
rational
for
the
state
of
louisiana
to
think
so?
whether
that’s
in
adequate
basis.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
is
special
qualifications
statutes
cannot
be
made,
can
they
to
reach
every
situation
when
there
is
a
line
drawing
process?
unknown
speaker
does
this
requirement
apply
any
other
public
office
in
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
is
there
legislative
history
why
they
attested
to
holding
this
office?
unknown
speaker
is
he
eligible
to
be
considered
now?
unknown
speaker
well
suppose
he
had
this
tougher
side
now,
there
will
be
a
vacancy,
could
he
be
considered
now?
unknown
speaker
well
i
suppose
he
had
not,
could
he
then
be
considered?
unknown
speaker
why
does
he
want
a
job,
is
it
a
compensatory
job
or
is
it….
unknown
speaker
i
asked
selfishly
because
i
have
one
time
served
in
an
airport
board
and
i
do
not
quite
understand
what
the
fuss
is
all
about.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
there
mr.
adcock,
what
governmental
bodies
under
louisiana
law
may
impose
taxes
to
fund
airport
bombs,
if
you
have
such
things.
any
of
these
organizations;
the
parish
council,
the
city
council,
the
airport
authority?
unknown
speaker
does
the
airport
authority
require
the
consent
of
any
other
governmental
body
before
it
may
assess
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
mr.
adcock,
what
do
you
with
the
language
that
is
against
use,
it
is
set
back
in
1943,
and
more
than
40
years
ago
this
court
determined
that
an
unlawful
denial
by
state
action
of
right
to
state
political
office
is
not
a
denial
of
a
right
of
properties
or
liberty.
unknown
speaker
it
cites
this
case,
with
the
proof.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
have
a
property,
right,
what
does
he
have?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
known
case
the
man
with
the
(inaudible)
because
he
was
a
negro,
and
this
court
said
that
was
not
enough.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
does
say
that
when
you
go
on
to
tax
rolls,
you
have
to
go
on
according
to
your
race.
unknown
speaker
it
must
act
affirmatively,
suppose
it
does
not
act
at
all,
what
happens
then?
unknown
speaker
mr.
keogh,
you
have
been
representing
the
commission
or?
unknown
speaker
since
the
1960,
were
you
doing
that
when
this
act
151.
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
us
the
reason
for
this
requirement?
unknown
speaker
well,
one
had
to
be
an
elector
as
well
as...
unknown
speaker
the
owner
of
assessed
property.
unknown
speaker
which
he
was,
the
qualified
elector
would,
why
was
not
that
enough,
i
am
curious?
unknown
speaker
they
could
be
--
is
there
is
a
personal
property
tax
in
this
area?
unknown
speaker
this
does
not
apply
to
an
automobile.
unknown
speaker
they
never
could
and
--
justice
marshall
quotes
also
goes
on
and
requires
that
that
fact
be
noted,
make
a
mention
there
on
the
assessment
rolls.
so
that
i
suppose
the
requirement
of
owning
property
assessed
in
that
parish
requires
that
the
written
records
disclose
the
race
of
that
person.
if
it
could
not
meet…
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
is
not
–
if
that
is
not
the
reason
and
of
course
you
said,
you
are
concerned
about
the
patrons
in
bus
station
but
they
are
not
going
to
be
there
for
six
months,
you
do
not
suppose.
what
do
you
suppose
this
does
over
and
above
the
elector
requirement.
what
does
it
add?
unknown
speaker
supposing,
we
had
an
example
--
a
young
flight
instructor
who
did
not
own
any
property,
lived
there
on
a
month
to
month
basis,
and
just
out
of
the
airport
or
something
like
that,
why
should
he
be
disqualified
as
opposed
to
someone
happens
to
own
an
automobile?
what
is
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
what
if
they
said,
having
property
assessed
of
a
value
over
$1000?
unknown
speaker
how
about
over
$500?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
nexus
is
you
want
to
be
sure
that
this
person
owns
at
least
$30
or
$40
worth
of
property.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
that
owning
$30
or
$40
worth
of
property
is
better
evidence
to
that
than
six
months
residence.
unknown
speaker
you
also
concede
that
there
must
be
some
reason
further
for
this
requirement
in
order
for
it
to
be
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
under
personal
property
tax
laws,
is
there
is
a
minimum
figure
that
is
tax
exempted?
what
point
in
value
you
start
got
paying
personal
property
tax?
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
an
exception
to
this
like
the
federal
income
tax?
unknown
speaker
whatever
that
is,
it
is
an
amount
over
that
so
it
better
be
less
than
$1000
or
you
concede
in
your
case…
unknown
speaker
did
you
not
suggest
to
me
that
if
it
is
a
$1000
or
more
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
we
really
do
not
know
the
dimensions
of
this
class
bceasue
we
do
not
know
here
the
exemption
starts.
unknown
speaker
it
would
still
be
assessed,
that
is
your
point.
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
way
you
distinguish
turner
purely
on
race?
unknown
speaker
how
else
do
you
distinguish
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
never
mind.
unknown
speaker
mr.
keogh,
may
i
try
again?
unknown
speaker
is
all
tangible
personal
property
assessed?
unknown
speaker
so,
that
one
sticker
furniture
you
mentioned
would
have
to
be
reported…
unknown
speaker
as
of
the
first
day
of
the
year
or.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
though
that
the
parish
council,
--
he
is
elected.
he
does
not
have
to
own
property
but
if
he
is
to
be
appointed
to
the
commission,
he
has
to
own
assessed
property.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
there
is
a
voluntary
system
or
your
friend
did
any
taxpayer
can
get
himself
on
the
assessment
rolls
without
much
difficulty,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
need
to
draw
them
to
statute
then.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
nobody
files
a
return.
unknown
speaker
do
you
get
anybody
on
the
board
then,
on
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
do
you
accept
your
opponent’s
distinctions
distinguishing
turner
as
he
did
on
the
three
prepositions?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
it
applies
or
has
no
relevance
here?
unknown
speaker
at
least
one
member
of
your
state,
supreme
court
felt
so,
didn't
it.
