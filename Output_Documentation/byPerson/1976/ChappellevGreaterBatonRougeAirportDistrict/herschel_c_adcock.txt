mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
herschel
adcock
and
i
represent
the
appellant
in
this
matter
e.
c.
chappelle,
jr.
this
is
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
on
the
constitutional
issue
in
that
a
louisianaa
statute
requires
the
ownership
of
property
assessed
within
a
parish
in
order
for
a
person
to
be
a
member
of
the
airport
commission.
for
period
of
five
years,
prior
to
the
time
the
appellant
resigned,
he
was
an
executive
director
and
secretary
of
the
greater
baton
rouge
airport
district.
mr.
chappelle
was
the
airport
for
all
intent
purposes.
he
ran
the
entire
show.
with
the
airport
commission
giving
him
technical
advise.
mr.
chappelle
then
resigned
his
position
as
the
director
of
the
airport
and
was
appointed
as
a
member
of
the
airport
commission.
shortly,
thereafter
prior
to
the
time
that
his
appointment
ran,
east
baton
rouge
parish
clerk
summarily
dismissed
mr.
chappelle
from
the
commission
after
receiving
a
legal
opinion
that
sends
mr.
chappelle
did
not
own
property
assessed
in
east
baton
rouge
parish
that
he
was
not
qualified
to
serve
as
a
commissioner
on
the
airport.
based
upon
this
notion
mr.
chappelle
then
filed
suit
in
district
court
in
baton
rouge.
alleging
number
one
that
he
did
meet
the
qualifications
that
he
did
own
property
that
had
been
assessed
in
east
baton
rouge
parish
and
it
was
proved
in
court
that
he
did
own
property
on
which
he
had
actually
paid
taxes,
but
the
court
held
the
sense
this
property
was
not
listed
on
the
assessment
rules
that
he
had
not
technically
met
the
requirements
to
be
a
member
of
the
airport
commission.
mr.
chappelle
likewise
the
alternative
that
the
court
determine
that
he
did
not
meet
these
qualifications
raised
the
issue
that
the
act
which
required
the
ownership
property
was
unconstitutional
and
violation
of
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
united
states
constitution.
on
march
4,
1975;
mr.
chappelle
was
formerly
denied
his
seat
from
airport
commission.
on
july
23,
1975
nineteenth
judicial
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
city
of
baton
rouge
stating
that
indeed
he
did
not
have
the
right
to
sit
on
the
airport
commission
because
he
did
not
have
property
assessed
in
east
baton
rouge
parish.
mr.
chappelle
then
went
to
the
next
procedure
he
asked
the
court
of
appeal,
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeal
sitting
in
baton
rouge
to
review
the
decision.
once
again,
he
urged
the
equal
protection
in
the
process
clauses
of
the
united
state
of
constitution.
once
again,
the
court
of
appeal
aligned
to
stay
up
with
the
district
court
stating
they
own
no
assessed
property
and
was
therefore
not
qualified
to
sit
as
a
member
of
the
airport
commission.
mr.
chappelle
had
no
direct
right
of
appeal
to
the
louisiana
state
supreme
court
but
asked
the
supreme
court
to
review
this
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
supreme
and
a
memorandum
decision
denied
the
writ
with
one
of
the
justices
stating
that
the
writ
should
be
granted
and
he
cited
the
case
on
which
we
principally
relied
turner
v.
fouche.
we
held
before
the
court,
we
believe
three
questions.
the
first
one
is
the
case
of
turner
v.
fouche,
does
it
mandate
that
this
statute
in
louisiana
that
requires
the
ownership
of
assessed
property,
does
it
mandates
this
statute
destruct
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
secondly,
the
court
should
determine
whether
or
not
this
act
is
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
in
that
the
requirement
of
the
ownership
of
assessed
property
has
no
reasonable
basis
as
to
the
qualifications
of
a
person
to
sit
on
the
airport
commission.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
it
is
a
specialized
commission
that
deals
with
the
day-to-day
affairs
of
the
airport
itself.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
this
body
is
a
public
body
that
sits
and
actually
approves
leases
and
deals
with
the
day-to-day
affairs
of
the
airport
it
is
a
public
appointed
body
they
serve
for
a
given
term.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
yes
sir.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
cases,
your
honor.
the
third
question
we
think
this
court
should
consider
is
whether
or
not
a
citizen
has
the
constitutional
right
or
fundamental
right
to
hold
an
appointed
position?
that
is
whether
he
should
have
the
right
to
be
consider
to
it
an
appointment
of
a
public
body
and
whether
or
not
the
ownership
of
property
should
come
into
he
picture
at
all.
it
is
our
position
that
at
this
court,
oppose
a
louisiana
statute
that
permits
the
state
to
stay
to
require
the
ownership
of
assessed
property.
this
will
just
open
the
door
for
additional
classifications
and
will
completely
undermine
the
protection
that
citizens
have
to
be
considered
and
appointments
to
public
offices.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
the
residency
requirements
can
be
argued
as
having
a
reasonable
basis
if
someone
--
if
you
do
not
have
a
residency
requirement
it
would
be
too
difficult
for
the
boarding
officials
to
keep
up
with
citizens.
you
could
have
someone
who
would
move
to
one
place
and
vote
and
to
different
areas
and
vote.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
okay,
the
to
lay
out
at
a
place
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
i
believe
is
a
rational
basis
to
determine
whether
someone
is
qualified
to
sit
in
a
public
position,
but
to
require
to
that
person
owns
property
assessed
any
parish
in
order
to
be
considered
for
a
public
office
is
in
violation
of
equal
protection
laws
of
the
time.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
i
do
not
believe
that
the
ownership
of
the
property
can
be
considered
as
inductive
of
someone
having
an
attachment
to
a
particular
area
because
--
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
yes.
well
the
state
of
louisiana
apparently
addressing
this
act
both
that
it
did
have
some
rational
basis,
it
is
our
position
that
it
does
not
that
the
ownership
of
property
does
not
make
one
better
qualified
to
sit
as
an
airport
commissioner,
especially
in
light
of
the
facts
that
we
have
before
the
court
here
today.
here
he
have
an
expert
in
the
field
of
aviation,
a
man
who
had
run
the
airport
for
five
years,
who
had
resided
in
the
area
for
great
length
of
time,
yet
he
was
denied
a
seat
on
the
airport
commission
because
he
did
not
--
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
no
sir,
i
was
given
that
as
an
example
of
how
this
statute
does
discriminate
against
persons
who
are
highly
qualified,
here
we
have
a
public
body
making
decisions
for
the
entire
public
of
parish
of
east
baton
rouge,
and
the
greater
baton
rouge
area.
these
are
citizens
throughout
the
parish
are
this
area
of
the
state
who
have
great
need
for
an
adequate
airport.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
not
to
my
knowledge
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
no
one
seems
to
be
able
to
tell
me.
i
have
examined
the
records,
when
this
deal
was
presented
to
the
legislature
in
1969
and
there
is
nothing
in
there
stating
why
they
had
a
requirement
of
the
ownership
property.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court,
and
of
the
parish
attorney
he
would
not
be
because
he
during
the
time,
that
he
was
dismissed,
and
the
time
this
case
actually
came
to
trial
and
the
tip
to
aviod
the
payment
of
tremendous
fees
and
cost
to
mr.
chappelle
he
did
go
and
buy
a
property.
the
court
ruled
that
that
was
allude
question
that
the
statute
required
the
ownership
of
property
at
the
time
he
was
appointed
because
he
did
not
owned
the
property.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
if
this
statute
is
remains
on
the
books
he
could
not
because
he
does
not
own
property,
he
has
since
dispossessed
himself
of
this
real
estate.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
yes
sir.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
it
is
not
a
compensatory
job.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
i
will
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
a
certain
extend
although
it
is
the
part
of
the
state
records.
mr.
chappelle
has
a
long
record
of
being
connected
with
aviations.
he
is
a
retired
air
force
colonel
he
has
served
in
numerous
capacities
with
airports
in
the
past.
there
is
a
political
struggle
between
the
mayor
and
the
another
politician
in
the
area
and
he
chose
the
wrong
friend,
apparently.
he
wanted
to
remain
in
the
field
of
aviation,
so
he
would
have
the
opportunity
to
attend
seminars
that
will
keep
him
abreast
of
the
changes
in
the
field
of
aviation.
that
was
his
principle
reason
for
warning.
we
believe
that
the
language
we
have
cited
on
our
brief
on
page
seven,
in
the
turner
v.
fouche
case
is
one
should
control
the
situation
and
i
will
quote
the
portion
of
it.
the
appellants
and
the
members
of
their
places
do
have
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
be
considered
for
a
public
service
without
the
burden
of
ambitiously
discriminatory
qualifications.
we
submit
that
this
is
ambitiously
discriminatory
qualification
that
is
a
qualification
that
you
must
meet
of
owning
the
property
assessed
and
bear
in
mind
that
the
lower
court
did
hold
that
mr.
chappelle
owned
the
property.
it
did
hold
a
property
as
determined
louisiana
means
either
real
or
personal
property,
they
held
that
he
own
property
located
in
east
baton
rouge
parish.
we
are
not
just
talking
about
land,
we
are
talking
about
the
property,
but
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
not
listed
on
the
assessment
row
was
the
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
in
which
to
uphold
the
lower
court.
we
further
submit
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
ownership
of
property
in
that
there
is
no
--
this
does
not
make
a
person
better
qualified
be
an
airport
commissioner
simply
to
have
his
property
listed
on
the
assessment
rolls,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
yes,
the
airport
authority,
the
city
council
can
impose
taxes,
and
of
course
the
state
legislatures.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
i
do
not
believe,
mr.
keogh,
the
parish
attorney
can
better
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
we
believe
that
the
line
of
cases,
turner
v.
fouche
and
the
other
caseâ€¦
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
with
the
proof.
we
believe
that
the
turner
v.
fouche,
what
we
are
sitting
on
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
compelling
state
interest
for
requiring
this
classification.
now,
a
person
does
not
have
a
fundamental
right
to
be
on
the
airport
commission,
but
he
has
the
fundamental
right
to
be
considered
for
this
position,
and
he
cannot
be
denied
this
right.
if
such
denial
runs
a
file
with
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
at
the
united
states
constitution,
this
we
submit
has
happened
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
turner
v.
fouche
case.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
he
has
a
--
it
is
a
fundamental
right,
rising
from
the
constitution,
not
to
be
discriminated
in
consideration
or
appointment
to
this
public
body.
if
there
was
a
compelling
state
interest
for
requiring
this
classification,
yes
perhaps.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
well,
we
believe
this
court
has
overruled
that
finding
in
the
snodden
case
in
many
areas,
and
we
further
submit
that
this
statute
--
no
sir,
we
submit
this
statute
could
have
justice
wale
said
he
must
be
a
white
citizen
owning
property
assessed.
it
would
have
been
a
little
easier.
i
do
not
believe
our
state
court
would
have
permitted
that
statute
to
stand
when
it
was
attacked
on
the
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
i
am
not
familiar
with
that.
i
am
not
going
to
say
it
does
not,
but
if
it
does,
i,
being
a
louisiana
citizen,
i
was
not
aware
of
it,
and
it
is
hard
for
me
to
accept
that.
finally,
and
as
i
have
said
at
the
outset,
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
for
the
upholding
of
this
statute
which
prohibits
any
person
from
being
considered
for
such
appointment.
consideration
is
the
key,
not
the
right
to
be
on
that
commission,
but
consideration
for,
because
we
have
here
a
person
that
i
think
all
parties
would
admit
is
qualified
to
serve
in
the
airport
commission,
had
he
not
been,
he
certainly
would
not
have
been
appointed.
but
we
have
a
person
who
was
stricken
by
the
parish
clerk
simply
because
he
did
not
own
property
assessed,
and
he
is
a
baton
rouge
page.
we
respectfully
request
this
court
to
strike
that
portion
of
louisiana
act
151
of
1969
as
to
be
unconstitutional,
thank
you.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
yes
sir,
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counselor
stated
at
the
outset
that
he
did
not
see
or
we
get
the
notion
of
the
fundamental
right.
i
want
you
to
once
again,
direct
you
to
page
seven
of
our
brief.
the
language
from
the
turner
v.
fouche
case.
the
court
specifically
held
that
the
state
may
not
deny
the
sum.
the
privilege
of
holding
public
office
that
extends
to
others
on
the
basis
of
distinctions
that
violate
federal
constitution
guarantees.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
public
body.
contrary
to
what
mr.
keogh
said,
if
it
was
just
sitting
there
what
is
the
purpose
of
having
it?
this
body
can
enter
into
the
leases
where
the
parishâ€™s
property
is
leased
to
persons.
the
rentacar
people,
the
other
airport
hangers,
are
all
leased
and
this
body
is
the
one
that
enters
into
those
leases.
it
can
spend
money.
it
can
authorize
the
expenditure
of
different
clients,
and
we
further
submit
that
this
requirement
is
one
that
has
found
its
way
in
a
statute
and
there
is
no
reasonable
basis,
for
instance,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
director
of
finance
or
the
parish
of
east
baton
rouge
own
property
assessed
in
louisiana,
east
baton
rouge.
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
director
of
the
airport
own
a
property
assessed
in
east
baton
rouge.
these
are
appointed
positions
and
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
parish
attorney
who
is
likewise
appointed
own
property
assessed
in
parish
of
east
baton
rouge.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
under
the
dictates
of
this
statute.
we
have
a
situation
here
where
mr.
chappelle
did
actually
own
properties
which
taxes
were
paid,
the
could
found
that
he
did
owned
a
property
and
that
he
paid
taxes
but
the
mere
fact
that
this
property
was
not
listed
on
the
assessment
rolls
was
the
means
they
used
to
disqualify
him
and
remove
him.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
mr.
justice
no
one
does
it.
this
is
a
statute
that
is
sitting
on
the
books
and
i
know
of
no
person.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
yes
sir,
maybe
there
should
be
a
requirement
of
something
that
is
enforced,
but
this
is
a
statute.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
no
sir.
no
one
files
the
return.
the
exemption
is
so
great
that
there
is
no
personal
property
tax
is
except
with
the..
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
the
real
property
must
be
on
the
taxing
rolls
and
i
truthfully
believe
that
this
is
what
the
legislature
meant.
however,
property
as
its
defined
in
the
louisiana
and
most
of
the
jurisdictions
has
--
it
is
either
personal
or
real
property.
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
no
sir.
i
truthfully
believe
--
mr.
herschel
c.
adcock
i
think
turner
applies
to
this
decision
as
it
is
