mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
joseph
keogh,
and
i
represent
the
appellees
in
this
matter.
i
spoke
to
the
clerk
earlier,
and
if
i
my
take
about
two
seconds
of
the
court’s
time,
i
want
him
to
verbally
amend
a
typograph,
we
are
on
page
seven
of
the
appellee’s
brief.
the
phrase
as
it
appears
is
not
the
way
that
it
was
intended
to
be
printed.
the
phrase
should
read.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
well,
the
second
paragraph
of
page
seven.
it
is
implicit
to
my
defense
before
the
court,
because
we
do
not
call
with
the
turner
case
in
the
way
it
reads.
it
read
the
turner
rule,
and
we
then
result
in
a
further
unwanted
intrusion
on
legislative
authority.
it
should
read,
and
further
result
in
and
unwarranted
intrusion,
because
we
do
not
feel
like
the
turner
case
was
an
unwarranted
intrusion
on
the
legislative
authority
of
the
state
of
georgia.
in
fact,
we
embrace
the
turner
v.
fouche
case,
and
we
embrace
all
of
the
decisions
that
stem
from
that
line
of
jurisprudence.
yet,
submit
to
this
honorable
court,
may
it
please
the
court
that
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
some
of
the
questions
already,
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
does
not
fall
within
the
ambit
of
equal
protection
as
said
forth
in
turner
v.
fouche.
the
essential
part
of
the
case
that
the
appellants,
i
truthfully
believe
have
misstated
unintentionally
of
course
is
that
this
was
a
fundamental
right,
and
all
of
our
research
indicates
that
there
are
a
lot
of
fundamental
rights
that
this
court
has
set
forth;
marriage,
appropriation,
vote,
equal
voting
power,
interstate
travel,
first
amendment
rights,
all
of
these
are
set
forth
in
page
eight
of
appellee’s
brief.
access
to
the
ballot
as
a
candidate
is
arguable,
whether
that
has
ever
been
clearly
annunciated
as
a
fundamental
right
or
not,
but
there
are
several
cases
interpreting
it;
bullet
v.
carter,
liben
v.
parish.
access
to
divorce
courts,
again
arguable
as
to
whether
that
is
a
fundamental
right.
criminal
courts,
counsel
and
transcript,
of
course,
privacy
of
some
types.
we
submit,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
that
this
is
not
a
fundamental
right
that
mr.
chappelle
had
to
serve
on
an
appointed
advisory
body,
the
question
was
asked
i
think
by
mr.
justice
marshall
perhaps
as
to
whether
or
not
this
board
of
commissioners
had
any
final
authorities.
the
question
was
referred
to
me
since
i
have
been
advising
these
people
for
nine
years,
they
do
not
have
any
final
authority.
the
act
which
we
reproduced
in
its
entirety
in
our
brief
sets
forth
the
fact
that
this
bodies
of
authority
is
essentially
of
a
recommendation
level,
they
recommend
to
the
parish
council
which
acts
as
the
airport
district.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
if
it
does
not
act
affirmatively,
it
has
a
meeting
every
month,
the
act
sets
forth
that
it
must
have
at
least
one
meeting
a
month,
and
it
transacts
as
transfer
of
funds,
that
it
transacts
day-to-day
business
of
the
director
that
he
brings
before
them,
pass
resolutions
and
so
forth.
now,
the
way
the
act
sets
up
this
commission,
it's
a
two
tier
process,
and
i
am
not
intentionally
borrowing
on
mr.
justice
marshall’s
language
two
tier
process
in
the
mergia
case,
the
mergia
case
used
that
concept,
but
it
is
a
two
tier
process.
this
commission
after
it
acts,
the
council
which
is
a
dual
sitting
body;
it
sits
as
a
parish
council,
which
is
a
single
member
districted
body
that
governs
the
entire
parish
and
the
city,
because
we
have
a
combine
form
of
government
in
baton
rouge.
it
recesses
as
a
parish
council,
and
then
reconstitutes
itself
with
the
same
membership
and
so
forth
as
the
governing
authority
of
the
airport
district.
so
all
the
decisions
that
are
made
by
--
resolutions,
--
this
is
all
found
in
the
act,
made
by
resolution
of
the
commissioner,
is
either
approved,
rescinded,
or
disapproved,
or
suspended
by
action
of
the
parish
council
sitting
as
the
airport
district.
so
consequently,
we
view
it
as
definitely
not
the
type
of
board
of
commissioners
that
one
is
entitled
to
serve
on
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
right.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
the
parish
and
the
city,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
i
certainly
was,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes,
i
can.
i
think
the
legislature
adopted
these
as
minimal
objective
criteria
as
opposed
to
subjective
criteria,
which
one
finds
in
cases
like
turner
v.
fouche,
and
one,
to
establish
some
nexus
with
the
parish.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
right,
two
qualifications
only;
you
had
to
be
a
qualified
elector
and…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
well,
the
legislature
in
its
wisdom
may
not
have
--
and
i
submit
to
you
in
all
candor,
may
not
have
been
as
wise
as
we
today
in
1969
about
trying
to
set
a
requirement
to
fulfill
the
state
purpose
of
connectivity
or
nexus
to
the
parish
to
show
an
interest
in
the
community
such
that
one
could
not
go
out
and
appoint
a
transient
at
the
greyhound
bus
station
for
example.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
those
are,
but
they
are
elected,
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
are
elected,
and
they
serve
a
legislative
purpose;
they
enact
laws,
ordinances,
and
they
serve
also
as
the
other
bodies
such
as…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
the
council
appoints
the
board
of
commissioners.
so
it
is
really
rather
confusing,
because
the
council
could
appoint
anyone
who
they
wish,
and
this
is
why
i
argue
in
the
brief,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court
that,
really
i
believe
the
legislature
looked
at
this
not
only
as
establishing
a
reasonable
criteria
to
hold
a
nexus
with
the
appointee
to
the
parish,
on
interest
of
the
community,
but
moreover,
and
more
of
a
subtle
reason,
but
more
realistic,
is
to
operate
as
a
restraint
on
an
unbridled
authority
of
the
council
to
make
an
appointment
of
anyone
whom
they
desired
that
has
a
--
well,
not
always,
it
might
be
someone
just
passing
through
town.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes
sir,
exactly.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
and
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
the
point
that
appeals
to
me…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
no
sir,
it
is,
it
really
is
not.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
it
is
very
minimal,
and
this
is
why
we
get
to
the
three
areas
that
mr.
justice
marshall
talked
about
in
the
mergia
case,
if
we
get
that
deeply
into
looking
at
this
type
of
job.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
no
sir,
it
has
the
taxing
authority
if
approved
by
the
council,
it
has
no
primary
authority.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
it
has
bonding
authority
if
the
council
approves
it.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
no
sir,
it
does
not
have
it,
no
sir.
you
see
the
way
as
i
try
to
explain…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
not
a
bit
mr.
justice
white,
in
fact,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
every
action
they
take,
at
the
very
next
council
meeting
appears
on
the
council
agenda
under
the
heading
of
airport
district
business,
and
this
body…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
well,
the
director
has
that
responsibility,
but
it
has
responsibility
for…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
setting
policy,
yes
sir.
and
if
the
council
objects
to
that
policy,
when
it
sits
at
the
airport
district,
it
of
course
has
the
power
under
the
act
of
1969,
151.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
and
the
council,
because
you
see,
the
commission
is
essentially
a
body
of
an
advisory
nature.
with
no
final
authority
whatsoever
to
even
run
the
airport,
if
the
council
as
the
district,
sitting
at
the
district
commission….
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
very
minimal,
i
am
not
sure.
i
think
it’s
6
months
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
it's
6
months
is
very
minimal
length
of
time
but
the
point...
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
now
this
is
the
fine
point
of
fact
that
i
can
speak
to
--
it
is
not
in
the
record
because
we
did
not
send
up
the
--
lets
perhaps
in
the
transcript
we
did
not
send
up
the
pleadings
because
we
thought
would
just
stick
to
the
constitutional
issues
but
it
is
possible
that
sales
tax
on
something
like,
of
course
automobile.
mr.
justice
blackmun
but
the
problem
here
is
that
state
law
requires
that
if
i
own
any
piece
of
movable
property,
and
this
is
not
restricted,
the
previous
court
decisions
in
the
courts
below
have
all
held
that
this
does
not
require
someone
to
own
real
estate
like
free
holders
in
the
turner
case,
or
any
type
of
property
can
be
real,
corporal,
in-corporal,
the
movable
or
immovable,
you
can
own
one
sticker
furniture
and
technically
the
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana
says
that
one
that
owns
furniture
must
put
their
name
on
the
assessment
roll.
it
is
the
voluntarily
act
of
assessment,
just
as
we
voluntarily
pay
our
income
tax.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes
sir,
you
can,
then
of
course
we
have
a
permission
that….
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
race,
opposite
race
--
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
no,
sir
i
did
not
know
that
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
is
something
new
to
me,
i
did
not
realize.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
i
can
not,
i
find
that
hard
to
believe,
our
legislature
some...
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
mr.
justice
marshall.
our
legislature,
some
two
years
ago
spent
the
considerable
amount
of
time
and
money
through
the
legislative
council
to
go
back
through
every
law
that
was
on
the
books
on
the
state
of
louisiana
and
purged
that
type
of
material
from
the
law.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
they
missed
this
one.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
we
are
not
prepared
to
respond
to
that
question?
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
well,
we
feel
in
defense
of
the
legislature
that
enacted
it,
that
the
objective
of
course,
as
an
objective
test
is
to
create
some
additional
nexus
to
the
parish
in
the
sense
of
one
owning
property
would
tend
to
be
more
interested
in
affairs
in
the
airport.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
this
is
what
i
said
earlier,
that
we
are
here
today
and
i
will
be
the
first
to
conceive
this
fact,
can
think
of
a
lot
better
reasons
to
have
put
in
the
law
but
still
these
are
not
wholly
irrelevant
and
i
think
to
test,
once
you
get
beyond
the
strict….
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
that’s
a
closed
classification.
now,
this
is
the
important
part
that
mr.
justice
white
brought
up,
and
that
is
that
this
gentleman
could
have
opened
his
classification
by
buying
that
single
sticker
furniture.
red
hair
is
a
closed
--
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
i
think
that
too
would
be
a
closed
classification
because
one
would
then
be
penalizing
the
people
that
too
poor
to
own
$1000
worth.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
it
becomes
the
question
of
degree?
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
they
intend
to
remain
in
the
parish
and
have
some
interest
in
the
commission.
we
have
submit…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
no
sir.
i
concede
it
again
as
i
have
before
that
we
can
today
come
up
with
a
lot
of
better
ways
but
the
rule
is…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes
and
i
think
that
reason
is
simply
that
the
legislature
thought
that
this
together
with
the
qualified
elector
classification
would
certainly
indicate
that
the
people
that
are
appointed
have
some
good
intention
to
remain
in
parish.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
i
can
not
tell
you.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
i
am
certain,
there
is.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
one
could
appoint,
if
you
like
federal
income
tax,
i
would
assume
that
if
report
your
income
and
then
you
report
your
property
and
then
you
take
off
the
deduction.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
sir,
i
said
that
might
be
a
closed
class
and
as
such
it
would
be
very
suspect.
you
goes
back
to
the
strict
scrutiny
test
and…
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
correct.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes,
it
would
still
be
assessed
and
would
be
assessed
in
the
point
is
that
whether
it
is
for
$5
or
$100,
it's
a
not
a
closed
classification.
the
gentleman
could
go
out
and
become
a
member
this
class
quite
readily,
there
is
no
inference
in
this
case,
for
an
example,
as
it
was
in
turner
of
an
invidious
racial
discrimination.
this
board
of
commissioners
is
composed
of
black
and
white
and
the
chairman
is
black,
so,
we
get
entirely
out
of
these
considerations
of
equal
protection
of
the
law,
but
we
really
get
into
a
consideration
of
cameral
legislature,
it
would
please
the
court,
cameral
legislator
set
something
as
a
qualification
that
is
not
wholly
unreasonable,
certainly
not
the
best.
this
is
what
i
am
trying
to
say
to
you
your
honor,
it
is
not
the
best.
we
can
think
of
a
lot
better
ones
today,
with
the
perspective
of
since
1969
but
is
it
wholly
irrelevant
and
i
think
that
what
it
is.
i
don’t
think
it
is
wholly.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
i
think
in
the
turner
case,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
court
your
honors
recognized
that
in
that
case
there
was
an
invidious
discrimination
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that,
i
am
trying
to
recall
exactly
the
language
was,
about
the
decision
you
believe
refer
to
and
i
underlined
those
words.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes,
of
course.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes
sir,
it
is
subject
to
assessment,
but
it
is
a
voluntarily
assessment,
one
is
required
to
report
it
to
the
assessor.
mr.
joseph
f.
keogh
yes
sir
there
is
a
reporting
period
and
i
think
it
is
the
first
day
of
the
year
and
of
course
if
they
do
not,
then
of
course,
the
commissioner
has
no
way
of
knowing
that
tax
assessor
--
your
honor,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
on
the
part
that
i
was
–
want
to
refer
you
to
–
using
your
turner
case.
your
honors
kept
pointing
out
that
you
were
not
prepared
to
hold
that
the
georgia
requirement
of
the
freeholder
being
the
only
person
that
can
serve
as
a
member
of
the
board
means
that
according
from
the
decision,
the
possibility
that
other
circumstances
might
prevent
themselves
and
with
your
property
qualification
for
office
holder,
office
holding
could
survive
constitutional
scrutiny.
that
plus
the
fact
that
in
turner,
there
was
a
requirement
that
one
be
an
of
owner
of
land,
immovable
real
estate.
that
is
what
the
word
freeholder
was
defined
as
in
the
decision,
and
moreover
in
turner,
the
body
that
was
being
constituted
was
more
of
what
we
have
called
a
political
body
making
political
decisions
namely
the
board
of
education.
this
board
of
education
was
a
far
different
instrumentality
than
the
board
of
commissioners
in
east
baton
rouge
parish.
it
had
final
authority,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
had
these
discretionary
powers.
it
was
in
fact
a
legislative
body.
this
is
something
we
do
have
in
the
instant
case.
those
are
the
three
basic
distinctions
that
i
have
made
to
show
that
this
is
not
of
the
same
category
as
the
turner
case.
and
in
conclusion,
we
just
have
to
submit,
may
it
please
the
court
that
in
this
particular
situation,
turner
is
not
applicable,
and
here
we
have
a
commission
which,
if
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
louisiana
cannot
set
these
not
wholly
unrealistic
basis,
wholly
irrelevant
then,
we
have
a
bunch
of
other
commissions
that
are
going
to
be
in
trouble
because
there
are
lot
of
these
types
of
requirements
that
are
made
to
service
on
zoning
bodies,
of
an
example
mr.
chief
justice.
zoning
bodies
and
many
others
and
we
submit
that
is
why
the
courts
below
should
be
sustained.
