who
was
the
judge,
mr.
…
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
rupp,
at
that
point,
do
you
feel
what
you
have
just
said
now
should
be
the
burden
of
the
defendant?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
isn’t
this
material
that
is
specifically
within
the
control
and
knowledge
and
awareness
of
the
government?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
you
see
is
the
defendant’s
burden.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
mr.
stewart
had
to
do
only
was
sum
of
the
guns
not
all
of
them.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
is
my
next
question,
does
your
position
depend
on
what
the
governments
investigation
uncovers
in
the
interim.
suppose
they
had
done
something
and
it
either
did
or
did
not
produce
something
additional,
your
position
different.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
gilden
in
the
government’s
brief,
they
make
a
second
argument
that
the
decision
on
that
delay
should
have
been
made
after
trial
rather
than
i
advance
of
trial.
did
they
ask
for
this
help
--
did
they
ask
the
court
to
postpone
the
decision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
you
think
about
their
suggestion
as
a
procedure?
