justice
thurgood
marshall
how
much
delay
does
there
have
to
be
before
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
dismissal
on
the
basis
of
actual
prejudice?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
other
words,
there
can
be
great
prejudice,
let’s
assume
an
alleged
bank
robbery
on
one
day
and
the
key
witness
for
the
defense,
whose
defense,
say,
is
an
alibi,
let's
say,
dies
the
day
after
the
robbery.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
terrible
prejudice,
and
that’s
caused
by
delay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
i
delay,
the
fact
the
indictment
wasn’t
brought
on
the
afternoon
of
the
robbery.
justice
thurgood
marshall
general
delays,
congress
has
set
statutes
to
limitations,
which
are
presumptively
the
period
during
which
an
indictment
need
be
returned;
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
much
delay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
reasonable
is
presumably
a
statute
of
limitations,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
certainly
does.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
you
think
that
when
he
did
that
more
than
once
or
twice,
that
the
prosecutors
have
said,
“there’s
something
going
on
around
here
we
have
been
looking
to,
because
that
doesn’t
happen
every
day”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
would
the
prosecutor
say,
“we’ve
got
to
take
another
look
at
this”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
they
did.
they
took
another
look!
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
he
start
calling?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
we
the
government
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
other
words,
any
reasonable
explanation
by
the
government,
let
see
if
i
get
this.
the
defendant
concedes
that
it
will
have
the
burden
of
showing
both
delay
and
the
prejudice
and
then
the
government
can
successfully
meet
that
merely
by
showing
some
reasonable
explanation
of
why
the
delay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose,
any
one
or
all
three
had
been
the
subject
of
some
government
testimony
to
district
court,
could
you
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
stood,
the
day
after
the
crime,
what
would
you
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
think
its
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
is
still
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
determines
how
much
evidence
is
available
for
prosecution
other
than
the
us
attorney?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
he
is
provocative
and
nobody
else’s?
justice
thurgood
marshall
weel,
if
he
wants
to
little
bit
more,
he
just
wants
one
more
witness.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
been
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
can’t
you
assume
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
do
not
assume
that
he
did
it
to
deliberately,
will
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
good
is
it
to
do
it,
to
hold
up
prosecution
deliberately?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
told
at
law
school
that
delay
was
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
because
he
would
always
rely
on
the
prosecutor's
witness
dying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
weren't
you
taught
that
in
law
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
again
mr.
gilden
what
good
is
the
statute
of
limitations.
rather
what
use
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
part
of
the
constitution
or
statute
tells
the
prosecuting
attorney,
that
he
must
file
his
--
get
his
indictment
within
a
certain
number
of
months?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
are
you
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
are
you
injured?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
guarantees
you
those
witnesses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
you
are
entitled
to
show
it
but
i
wonder
whether
you
entitle
to
win?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
merits
how
many
months
do
you
think
are
necessary?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
you
can
because
you
can
get
a
narcotics
indictment
in
about
16
minutes
and
you
can
get
involved
in
conspiracy
indictment
in
about
two
years,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
there
is
no
line
to
draw.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
not
it
true
that
he
did
in
this
case?
is
that
true
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn’t
that
to
answer
to
my
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
he
did
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say,
he
never
called
the
prosecutor
and
says,
“why
do
not
you
do
some
about
this
case?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
like
the
government.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
did
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
what
you
wanted
him
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
certainly
could
not
have
told
him
that
i
am
afraid
that
mr.
stewart
is
going
to
die.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
advantage
of
this
case
is
to
reconsider
the
circumstances
in
which
the
constitution
requires
that
an
indictment
be
dismissed
because
a
delay
between
the
commission
of
the
offense
and
the
initiation
of
the
prosecution.
the
court
of
appeals
haven't
responded
and
have
been
deprived
with
due
process
by
an
18-month
delay
whose
only
purpose
was
to
enable
the
government
to
discover
other
participants
in
the
crime
which
was
--
ultimately
was
charged.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
investigative
delay
is
not
fundamentally
unfair
to
criminal
defendants,
since
it
ensures
that
they
will
not
be
indicted
until
the
prosecutor
is
completely
satisfied
that
he
should
prosecute
and
he
will
be
able
properly
to
establish
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
