but
that
was
totally
different
in
what
respect
would
that
had
met
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
are
saying
is
if
they
had
proved
that
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
say
it
proved
that
much,
not
withstanding
the
prejudice
that
you
had
proved
nevertheless
you
would
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
is
no
question
of
the
government,
what
if
there
is
no
suggestion
of
any
deliberate
delay
to
hurt
you
and
no
negligence,
but
simply
a
desire
of
the
government
to
keep
it
under
coverage
and
under
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
let
us
assume
that
we
are
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
not
be
a
continuous
investigation
of
you
or
your
client,
it
would
simply
be
that
this
agent
was
in
place
and
he
might
be
making
other
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
that
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
think
that
as
long
as
your
prejudice
even
in
negligence,
even
in
attention
just
in
attention
and
negligence
would
--
that
you
do
not
even
need
to
show
that
i
think
you
just
show
the
delay
in
the
prejudice
and
then
the
government
must
explain
it.
