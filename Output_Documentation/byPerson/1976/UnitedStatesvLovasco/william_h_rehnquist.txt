william
h.
rehnquist
are
not
you
really
arguing
that
we
are
bound;
we
must
read
the
statute
of
limitations
as
congress
had
said,
the
action
maybe
brought
within
five
years.
but,
provided
that
it
must
be
brought
sooner,
must
the
government
shows
that
it
could
not
have
been
brought
sooner,
isn’t
that
really
what
you
are
arguing
on
the
modification
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn’t
the
statute
say
that
they
can
move
within
five
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
they
are
saying
is
that
congress
gave
them
five
years
of
inertia
in
statute
of
limitation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
a
civil
case,
where
the
government
is
given
a
period
to
bring
an
action
against
a
private
individual
by
a
statute
of
limitations
and
you
can
make
the
same
showing
in
a
civil
case,
does
the
due
process
clause
violated
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
due
process
clause
talks
about
deprivation
of
life,
liberty
or
property,
presumably
a
civil
defendant
could
be
deprived
of
property
just
as
surly
as
a
criminal
defendant
could
be
deprived
of
liberty
by
unwarranted
government
delay
that
was
still
within
the
limitations
period.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
rundamental
constitutional
rights
you
are
talking
about
other
than
the
right
to,
not
be
deprived
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn’t
the
speedy
trial
act
going
through
the
pressure
on
the
government
not
to
bring
its
indictments
until
it
is
sure
that
it
is
all
ready
to
go
to
trial.
well,
certainly
because
they
are
going
to
have
all
of
their
evidence,
i
think
that
is
what
they
want
to
do,
but
i
don’t…
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
gravity
of
the
offense
play
any
part
in
the
calculus
you
are
suggesting,
for
example,
typical
state
law
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
for
murder.
whereas
for
ordinary
theft
larceny
the
statute
the
maybe
three
years,
four
years.
would
you
say
that
the
government’s
time
could
be
longer
depending
on
the
seriousness
of
the
offense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
even
though
if
you
appeal
from
the
dismissal
before
verdict
and
the
court
of
appeals
besides
your
own,
then
you
may
not
be
able
to
prosecute
a
man
because
that
is
double
jeopardy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
a
double
jeopardy
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
that
has
prompted
my
question.
