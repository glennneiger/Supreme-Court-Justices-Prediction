mr.
louis
gilden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
do
want
to
clarify
a
few
statements
the
solicitor
has
made
which
i
don’t
think
are
not
borne
out
in
the
record.
judge
reagan
did
not
decide
this
case
under
rule
48,
justice
blackmun.
he
decided
it
merely
on
fifth
amendment,
the
essentials
as
set
forth
in
marion
that
there
was
pre-indictment
delay
and
subsequent
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
i
might
say
the
government
has
made
all
kinds
of
arguments
about
why
they
did
not
win
this
motion,
and
that’s
what
they
are
confronted
with
today.
and
justice
marshall,
when
i
talk
about
we
should
…
the
defendant
has
to
give
up
all
of
his
evidence
to
the
government
and
tell
the
government
what
his
case
is
going
to
be
is
sort
of
silly
and
nonsense,
it’s
contrary
to
law.
when
the
defendant
came
in
with
his
witnesses
to
the
trial
court
in
the
pretrial
motion,
he
presented
his
evidence
that
two
of
his
witnesses
had
died.
i
know
nothing
in
any
kind
of
law
in
this
country
that
says
that
a
defendant
has
to
signal
his
testimony
to
the
government
about
what
his
evidence
was
going
to
be.
the
government
at
no
time
asked
for
a
delay.
they
didn’t
ask
for
a
continuance
to
check
out
the
veracity
of
the
defendant’s
statement
to
the
court.
they
never
said,
“we
don’t
believe
these
two
witnesses
died
and,
therefore,
we
want
to
check
it
out
and
see
whether
or
not
they
would
support
your
statement,
they
would
exculpate
you
in
the
commission
of
this
crime
of
possession
of
stolen
mail
matter”.
i
might
say
the
government
runs
all
over
the
turf
here
with
respect
to
all
kinds
of
allegations,
because
they
said
nothing
in
the
pretrial
motion;
they
were
mute
on
why
they
failed
to
indict
this
man
within
17
months
and
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
they
have
some
obligation
to
the
--
let
me
say
this,
justice
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
let
me
say
this,
justice
--
mr.
louis
gilden
under
the
marion
case.
mr.
louis
gilden
the
pre-accusation
delay,
17,
18
months,
the
question
that
there
was
the
substance
of
material
actual
prejudice
that
this
court
has
stated
would
be
a
fifth
amendment
violation
in
marion.
i
might
say,
justice
rehnquist,
that
in
marion,
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
government
delaying
deliberately
to
get
a
tactical
advantage
over
the
defendant;
there
was
governmental
negligence.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
it
was
sent
back
by
this
court
to
see
whether
the
defendant
could
prove
actual
prejudice,
that’s
all.
mr.
louis
gilden
all
they
said
was,
we
understand
that
the
government
concedes
to
that.
that’s
all
this
court
said.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
we
didn’t
say
the
government
had
any
burden.
we
assume
the
burden
of
the
motion.
the
government
didn’t
do
anything.
i
mean,
the
government
talks
about
all
the
bad
things
that
are
going
to
happen
to
them
in
the
event
this
court
decides
that
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed,
that
this
is
going
to
interfere
with
their
investigation
of
crimes
and
society
and
defendant,
everybody
is
going
to
…
the
whole
administration
of
justice
is
going
to
collapse.
all
they
had
to
do,
justice
rehnquist,
is
come
in
and
say,
”we
moved
our
finger
from
a
to
“b.
they
didn’t
say
that.
well,
i
am
not
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
am
saying
that
my
reading
of
marion
is
certainly
different
to
than
the
solicitor’s
reading
of
marion,
and
maybe
i
read
marion
and
it
says
very
definitely,
”if
the
defendant
can
go
back
to
trial
and
can
at
the
trial
prove
actual
prejudice,
then
he
should
win
his
case
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment”.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
let
me
say
this,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
government
never
appealed
the
essential
finding
that
tom
stewart
would
have
testified
that
lovasco
did
not
know
the
guns
were
stolen
at
the
time
that
he
supplied
the
guns
to
lovasco.
now,
that
is
essential
testimony
under
18
u.s.c.
§
1708,
the
knowledge
of
stolen
-
that
i
know
these
guns
were
stolen,
that’s
the
essential
testimony,
it’s
the
bare
guts
of
a
defense
to
that
kind
of
a
case,
and
i
might
say
that
that
is
a
finding
of
the
eight
circuit.
the
government
has
not
appealed
that
material
prejudice
that
the
defendant
has
suffered
as
a
result
of
this
delay
to
this
court;
that’s
a
finding
this
court
has
to
accept.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
wouldn’t
want
to
set
up
any
standards
on
that,
justice.
mr.
louis
gilden
well
--
mr.
louis
gilden
certainly.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
that
would
be
an
extreme
situation.
i
might
say
that
--
you
know,
this
court
has
--
mr.
louis
gilden
but
this
court
in
marion
said
that
doesn’t
set
up
all
the
standards
with
respect
to
when
there
is
a
constitutional
right
involved
and
this
court
specifically
stated
that
when
the
fifth
amendment
due
process
question
is
involved
on
pre-accusation
delay
that
that’s
a
matter
that
can
be
asserted
and
the
courts
will
listen
to
it.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
am
not
going
to
say
how
much
delay,
but
i
believe
that
this
court
could
say
reasonable
delay
based
upon
--
mr.
louis
gilden
but
i
--
no,
i
don’t
think
so,
not
when
there
is
a
question
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
i
think
based
--
this
court
doesn’t
really
have
to
deal
with
the
amount
of
time,
and
i
might
say
that
in
dickey
and
--
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
in
the
dickey
and
in
marion
and
in
barker,
the
court
didn’t
set
out
any
limits
that
this
is
particularly
the
situation.
in
barker
v.
wingo,
justice
powell
didn’t
say
that
“we’re
going
to
say
that
all
these
things
have
to
be
proven
in
order
to
show
a
sixth
amendment
violation
of
the
constitution”.
it
says,
“these
are
the
things
we
should
consider,
and
the
trial
court
should
be
given
certain
latitude
to
make
these
decisions
based
upon
what
he
finds,
based
upon
the
facts
in
front
of
him”.
and
i
feel
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
where
lovasco
kept
calling
the
government,
justice
marshall,
and
saying
…
he
didn’t
say,
“i
want
to
be”
--
he
essentially
said,
“i
want
to
be
indicted.
do
something.
let
me
know
if
i
am
innocent
or
i
am
going
to
be
indicted”.
he
did
it.
so
even
though
criminals
or
defendants
are
not
called
upon
to
ask
that
question,
in
this
case
lovasco
kept
calling
the
inspector
and
saying,
“what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me?
i
gave
you
a
statement,
what
are
you
going
to
do.
i
am
concerned
about
what’s
going
to
happen
to
me”.
and
at
no
time
did
the
government
come
back
and
do
anything
about
it.
in
fact
--
mr.
louis
gilden
i
would
think
so.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
would
think
so.
they
didn’t
do
anything!
mr.
louis
gilden
17
months
later,
they
took
another
look
and
--
mr.
louis
gilden
he
called
immediately,
right
after
his
statement
to
the
government,
when
he
came
in
and
gave
him
the
full
statement
in
front
of
his
attorney.
and
i
might
say
that
he
kept
calling,
and
he
expressed
his
anxiety.
and
let
me
say
this.
when
the
government
talks
about
a
stipulation
made
with
the
defendant’s
attorney,
that
stipulation
was
that
we
had
no
further
evidence
in
this
matter.
the
only
time
we
secured
some
additional
evidence
was
after
the
grand
jury
had
returned
their
indictment
against
him.
mr.
louis
gilden
we
the
government,
that’s
right.
we
had
nothing
else.
we
hadn’t
done
anything,
and
they
stated
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
to
the
court
as
to
what
they
had
done
for
17
months.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
believe
it’s
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
louis
gilden
it
is,
but
let
me
say
that
this
court
has
definitely
stated
both
in
dickey
and
also
in
marion
that
when
a
constitutional
right
becomes
in
some
way
triggered
by
the
facts,
that
that’s
something
this
court
is
going
to
listen
to
and
decide
whether
or
not
this
person
should
be
protected
based
upon
these
intervening
constitutional
rights.
mr.
louis
gilden
thank
you.
mr.
louis
gilden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
continuing
my
argument
in
this
matter,
i
might
say
that
the
government
at
no
time
before
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
eighth
circuit
ever
contended
that
the
defendant
had
to
prove
the
governmental
misconduct,
the
tactical
advantage
secured
by
the
government
by
delaying
prosecution.
this
is
the
first
time
that
it
has
been
raised
and
that
is
in
this
court.
the
government
conceded
before
the
district
court
that
all
you
had
to
do
is
prove
the
prejudicial
delay
and
the
subsequent
result
in
material
prejudice
and
both
elements
were
proved
in
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
is
a
little
bit
unusual
to
come
at
this
late
date
and
say
the
eighth
circuit
was
an
error,
when
the
same
eighth
circuit
did
not
have
these
fundamentals
before
them
at
the
time
that
the
government
argued
its
case
and
presented
its
brief
to
the
eighth
circuit
when
they
said
all
marion
required
was
the
delay
was
unreasonable
and
is
subsequent
result
in
material
prejudice.
mr.
louis
gilden
that
was
our
burden
and
we
proved
that
burden
by
showing
the
17-month
delay,
by
proving
that
the
defendant
had
called
the
government
from
time
to
time
on
five
or
six
occasions
said,
what
is
going
on?
the
government
conceded
that
he
had
anxiety
about
1situation
and
then
the
result
in
prejudice
in
the
death
of,
well
might
say
that
there
were
two
witness
that
died.
however,
the
district
court
laid
its
fundamentals
of
material
prejudice
on
the
death
of
stewart
and
the
eight
circuit
affirmed
that
finding
that
there
was
material
prejudice
in
the
death
of
stewart.
so,
there
was
the
result
in
material
prejudice.
mr.
louis
gilden
that
is
correct,
but
that
was
never
isolated
as
to
where
--
the
government
never
isolated
or
of
course
the
government
did
not
know
which
ones
came
from
stewart
and
which
ones
came
from
finding
the
guns
in
the
car
at
the
terminal
of
railroad
mail
facility.
however,
the
court
concluded
that
the
very
essential
element
which
is
the
question,
did
lovasco
know
that
the
guns
were
stolen
would
be
something
that
would
be
deprived
of
him
by
a
trial
without
having
this
material
evidence
present
at
the
any
trial
by
the
death
of
the
witness?
and
the
court
concluded
that
–
what
is
really
essential
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
the
question
that,
the
government
did
not
do
anything
for
17
months.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
well
our
position
will
be
different.
i
think
that,
if
the
government
had
just
showed
that
they
were
trying
to
do
something
for
17
months,
my
position
would
be
totally
different
before
this
court
and
would
have
been
different,
i
think,
the
proceedings
refer
the
district
court
because…
mr.
louis
gilden
it
would
meet
the
standards
that
they
were
continuing
there
investigation
and
they
showed
nothing
about
the
continuous
nature
of
the
investigation.
mr.
louis
gilden
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
think
that
was
in
the
framework
with
the
statute
limitations
and
the
question
of
foreseeability,
i
do
not
think
that
the
defendant
can
hold
the
government
to
that
kind
of
strict
proof
and
hold
that
sort
of
confined
within
a
box
that
way.
i
think
that
is
not
what
i
asking
this
court
to...
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
that
was
never
developed.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
that
was
case
like
a
continuous
narcotics
investigation.
i
think
that
that
would
satisfy.
mr.
louis
gilden
well
but
they,
had
they
presented
that
evidence
that
will
satisfying
the
criteria.
mr.
louis
gilden
that
would
satisfy
the
criteria
as
well.
i
do
not
think
that
i
--
i
do
not
want
to
hamstring
the
government
in
terms
of…
mr.
louis
gilden
we
will
say
something.
mr.
louis
gilden
that
is
correct,
that
is
all
i
am
asking
for
before
this
court,
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
asking
for
any
principles
which
nail
the
government
into
a
justification
which
might
meet
the
merits
of
the
case
or
getting
into
substance
of
the
issues
of
the
case.
just
showing
some
consideration
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
completed
investigation
and
now
we
want
to
get
some
more
evidence.
i
might
say
that
this
court
should
see
the
protectuality
of
what
the
government
has
done
here.
in
the
district
court,
that
the
government
argued
and
there
was
never
any
proof
in
the
record
about
this.
the
government
argued
that
they
were
trying
to
get
evidence
that
the
son
was
implicated,
the
defendant’s
son
and
they
want
to
nail
him;
they
did
not
feel
the
defendant
was
guilty,
but
they
felt
the
son
was
the
guilty.
then
in
eighth
circuit,
they
changed
that
argument
and
they
said
that
“we
want
to
find
out,
who
stole
the
mail”.
then
the
government
comes
before
this
court,
in
abundance
both
of
those
arguments
and
says
to
this
court,
“we
wanted
to
continue
the
investigation
to
nail
the
defendant,
we
want
to
get
more
evidence
on
him.”
so
now
they
have
got
three
arguments
and
none
of
those
were
supported
by
the
record
in
the
district
court.
so,
i
wonder
with
all
these
voluntary…
mr.
louis
gilden
i
would
not
be
here;
i
would
have
lost
my
motion.
i
think
the
court
would
have
conceded
that
they
gave
some
reason
or
justification
for
the
delay
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
reason
or
justification
for
the
delay
and
i
would
not
be
before
this
court,
well
i
try
to
probably
appeal
the
issue,
but
i
am
sure
i
would
have
gotten
very
for
and
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
entitled
to
get
vary
far.
i
think
that
based
upon
the
record
below,
there
is
an
absence
of
any
reason
or
justification.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
i
just
say
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
that,
i
am
just
saying
that
if
the
government
just
showed
that
they
had
moved
their
little
finger
one
inch
that
would
be
sufficient
to
show
that
they
were
doing
something.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
know
but
if
they
are
interceding
constitutional
rights
that
affect
the
defendant
by
reason
of
the
government,
we
say
thus
government
stays
before
this
court
and
this
is
the
interesting
proposition.
they
have
the
right
to
inertia
and
what
troubles
me
so
much…
mr.
louis
gilden
they
maybe
entitled
to
inertia
but
i
think
if,
that
if
intervening
constitutional
rights
come
into
play
as
here,
with
the
death
of
materiel
witnesses
and
due
process
comes
in
the
picture,
i
do
not
think
they
have
their
right
anymore,
i
think
they
are
--
they
have
that
responsibility
to
foresee
that
within
the
framework
of
the
statute
limitations,
that
there
maybe
some
result
in
prejudice
that
better
do
something
about
getting
this
case
to
trial.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
do
not
think
the
due
process
--
i
think
you
would
have
question
of
latches
there,
i
think
that
is
what
you
would
have
theoried
there
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
think
this
court
is
much
more
concerned
about
fundamental
constitutional
rights
of
criminal
cases
than
they
are
in
civil
latches.
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
the
fundamental
right
is
the
right
to
a
fair
trial,
justice
rehnquist.
if
you
do
not
have
all
your
witnesses
at
trail
you
have
not
had
a
fair
trial,
and
how
can
you
go
to
trial
when
you
have
lost
your
evidence
and
the
government…
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
that
--
i
might
say
that
there
was
a
question
i
was
presented
yesterday
and
i
can
say
that
certain…
mr.
louis
gilden
what
sir?
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
it
may
well
be,
but
i
think
that
certainly
the
court,
the
district
court
does
not
or
can
deal
with
that
issue
justice
marshall
or
you
can
say
that
certainly
that
is
something
the
government
had
no
control
over.
but,
the
government
had
control
over
these
proceedings
and
what
is
so
interesting
is
that
really
bothers
me
so
much
is
the
government…
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
he
is
the
only
one…
mr.
louis
gilden
true,
but
let
me
say
this,
this
is
also…
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
he
did
not
say
that
to
the
district
court,
he
had
to…
mr.
louis
gilden
that
would
have
been
enough;
he
was
trying
to
find
somebody.
mr.
louis
gilden
oh,
i
can
assume…
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
let
me
say
this,
i
believe
it
was
done
deliberately
certainly,
i
believe
that
when…
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
courts
have
held
and
this
court…
mr.
louis
gilden
well
that
is
true
and…
mr.
louis
gilden
i
was
taught
the
same
thing
your
honor,
but
i
might
say
too
that
it
works
for
--
it
is
a
double
edge
sword,
it
can
work
against
defendant
as
well.
i
worked
against
him
here
and
i
think
that
certainly
delay
does
benefit
defendant,
but
i
think
that
there
are
two
things
that
to
have
be
considered
here.
the
court
has
supervised
jurisdiction
over
its
own
proceedings
and
let
me
say
this,
the
court,
when
it
feels
that
there
is
been
a
lack
of
prosecution
or
want
a
prosecution
that
has
the
right
to
dismiss
a
case
over
a
prosecution
and
i
might
say
that
there
are
many
cases
that
hold
that
as
well.
mr.
louis
gilden
that
bothers
me,
no,
i
think
that
would
be
enough
to
have
it
dismissed
the
reason
that
bothers
me...
mr.
louis
gilden
yeha,
i
think
so.
mr.
louis
gilden
true,
but
what
troubles
me
so
much
justice
brennan,
is
that
we
now
operate
at
the
gun
shot
of
the
prosecutor,
both
courts
and
the
defendants
now.
mr.
louis
gilden
that
is
what
troubles
me
so
much,
justice
rehnquist
talked
about
the
root
cause,
the
delay
in
running
this
assistant
attorney
general,
i
might
say
that
we
now
--
the
prosecutor
shoots
the
gun
and
now
the
courts
have
to
get
ready
for
trial
within
60
days
and
defendants
have
to
get
ready
for
trial
in
60
days.
now,
we
have
judicial
accountability
that
courts
do
and
defendants
and
what
the
government
wants
to
do,
is
remove
all
judicial
accountability
for
their
actions.
mr.
louis
gilden
no,
i
understand,
but
i
think
there
should
be
judicial
accountability
for
their
inaction
inertia,
i
mean
when
we
are
accountable,
courts
and
defendants,
we
have
to
jump
at
the
women
and
at
the
trigger
of
the
government.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
view
of
the
philosophy
of
the
speedy
trial
act
and
the
policy
statement
of
congress
and
passing
it,
then
we
still…
mr.
louis
gilden
well,
i
would
say
this
is
probably
true,
but
what
is
interesting
here
is
that
lovasco
kept
calling
the
government
saying
“what
you
going
to
do?”
this
was
not
a
man
who
sort
of
took
off
and
thought
that
the
whole
matter
was
going
to
wash
away
and
that
nothing
was
going
to
happen
to
him,
he
is
hoping
for
delay
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
he
wanted
the
resolution.
i
would
say
certainly
many
defendants,
people
that
are
a
guilty
do
not
want
a
too
broad
trial,
they
do
not
want
to
go
to
jail.
but
i
think
people
that
are
concerned
about
their
innocence
and
people
that
are
concerned
about
their
anxiety
systems
and
all
that
are
concerned
about
some
immediate
resolutions
for
their
problems.
mr.
louis
gilden
never
did,
so
this
is
merely
an
advisory
opinion
of
asking
this
court
rule
on,
they
never
asked
the
court
for
the
exercise
of
this
discretion
in
delaying
the
matter
until
the
close
of
the
jury
trial.
mr.
louis
gilden
well
i
think
that
is
a
bad
one,
i
feel
that
when
you
get
into
pre-acquisition
delay
and
you
raise
the
question
of
fifth
amendment
due
process,
how
can
you
go
to
trial
when
you
have
lost
very
material
evidence.
i
think
the
district
court
has
to
make
that
determination
before
we
go
to
trial.
if
you
have
lost
your
evidence
and
you
have
lost
somebody
who
can
prove
your
innocence
and
he
finds
that
there
is
violation
due
process,
it
seems
to
me
you
cannot
have
a
fair
trial.
i
go
though
all
that
charade
with
a
purpose
and
at
the
close
of
the
trial
have
the
court
rule
on
whether
or
not
you
had
a
fair
trial.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
saving
two
thing,
you
are
saving
the
government
certainly
money
for
the
trial,
you
are
saving
judicial
time
and
judicial
economy
time
with
crowded
dockets
and
you
are
certainly
saving
defendant
a
lot
of
counsel
fees
if
he
has
ability
to
pay
for
a
trial
or
case
that
might
take
two
three
four
days
or
a
week
depending
upon
the
circumstances.
mr.
louis
gilden
well
i
might
say
that
it
is
something
the
court
can
be
concerned
about
and
i
think
it
is
something
that
as
raised
before
i
would
say
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
a
factor
in
this
matter
had
the
government
said
anything
at
all.
the
government
had
come
through
with
any
evidence
it
was
able
to
show
that
it
is
justifying
its
delay.
mr.
louis
gilden
well
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution;
there
is
nothing
in
any
law
except
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
louis
gilden
what
sir?
mr.
louis
gilden
we
are
injured
by
the
death
of
two
witnesses.
mr.
louis
gilden
well
no
one
guarantees
it
but
it
is
my
burden
to
prove
under
marion
that
i
have
been
prejudiced,
and
i
say
that
we
assume
that
burden
and
satisfy
the
district
court
that
we
had
been
prejudiced,
and
certainly
that
under
marion
we
are
entitled
to
show
they
are
prejudice.
mr.
louis
gilden
well
i
--
the
district
court
felt
that
i
should
--
what?
mr.
louis
gilden
i
do
not
want
to
limit
that…
mr.
louis
gilden
that
is
true.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
think
that
the
district
court
can
analyze
the
type
of
case
it
can
analyze
whether
it
is
a
complex
conspiracy
case,
it
can
analyze
whether
it
is
simple
event
like
here,
did
he
steal
the
guns
or
did
not
he
steal
the
guns,
that
he
know
that
they
were
stolen
or
didn't
he,
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
simple
proposition.
mr.
louis
gilden
i
would
say
certainly
that
a
district
judge
would
certainly
or
a
state
judge
would
certainly
weigh
very
heavily
dismissal
of
indictment
based
upon
a
murder
alligation
and
i
say
that,
that
is
something
to
be
concerned
about
with
respect
to
the
exercise
or
discretion
by
the
district
judge
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
prejudicial
delay
in
material
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
i
say
that
no
one
can
setup
standards
as
to
this
crime
deserves,
this
amount
of
prejudicial
delay
and
this
one
has
had
some
another
standard
of
time
i
think
it
is
something
for
the
district
court
or
the
state
court
to
decide,
within
the
framework
of
what
is
the
delay,
what
was
the
reason
for
it
and
how
was
the
defendant
in
anyway
prejudiced
by
the
delay.
mr.
louis
gilden
oh!
i
think
that
we
can
get
through
trial
within
60
days;
we
are
not
behind
at
all.
mr.
louis
gilden
one
more
a
case
called
barcait
(ph)
it
was
48
months
delay
i
believe
and
it
went
to
the
eighth
circuit,
it
came
out
of
kansas
city
and
what
do
you
call
that
eastern
district
or
the
western.
mr.
louis
gilden
the
district
judge
in
kansas
city
dismissed
the
indictment
for
a
48
months
delay
and...
mr.
louis
gilden
in
the
public
court
i
think
it
was
judge
gibson
who
wrote
the
opinion.
so,
i
would
say
that
from
what
i
know
and
what
in
crusing
all
the
cases
it
is
very
unusual
certainly
for
a
district
judge
to
dismiss
a
case
based
on
prejudicial
delay
and
material
result
and
prejudice.
you
will
find
that
the
courts
are
not
receipted
to
that
kind
of
reception
to
that
kind
of
motion.
so
i
think
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
government
is
certainly
exercising
a
lot
of
concern
about
the
administration
of
justice,
but
i
do
not
think
the
administration
of
justice
is
going
to
be
in
anyway
affected
by
decision
of
this
court,
that
the
defendant
was
prejudice
from
the
government
did
nothing
to
explain
or
justify
its
delay.
