mr.
john
p.
rupp
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
after
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
had
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
three
counts
of
the
indictment.
unlike
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
decision
on
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
holding
that
respondent
had
satisfied
with
the
majority
characterized
as
the
two
basic
elements
essential
to
a
claim
of
impermissible
pre-accusation
delay,
unreasonableness
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
prejudice
to
his
ability
to
defend
against
the
charges.
because
we
believe
the
decision
in
this
case
to
be
incorrect
and
because
that
decision
conflicts
with
the
approach
taken
by
several
other
courts
of
appeals
on
two
reoccurring
issues
of
substantial
importance,
we
sought
further
review
by
this
court.
i
should
like
to
begin
this
afternoon
by
outlining
as
briefly
as
i
can
the
context
in
which
the
issues
presented
here
arose.
respondent
was
indicted
on
march
6th,
1975
on
three
counts
of
unlawful
possession
of
materials
stolen
from
the
mails
and
one
count
of
dealing
in
firearms
without
a
license.
the
indictment
referred
specifically
to
eight
handguns
that
respondent
allegedly
had
processed
and
sold
between
july
25th
and
august
31st,
1973.
six
days
after
his
indictment,
respondent
moved
under
rule
48
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
the
sixth
amendment
to
have
the
charges
against
him
dismissed.
he
alleged
in
that
motion
that
the
government
had
not
obtained
any
information
relating
to
the
charges
in
the
indictment
after
september
of
1973,
that
the
ensuing
delay
of
approximately
18
months
was
unreasonable,
that
that
delay
had
caused
him
to
experience
anxiety
and
concern.
he
did
not
claim
that
the
delay
had
impaired
his
ability
to
defend
against
the
charges.
the
parties
stipulated
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
held
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
a
postal
inspector
had
interviewed
respondent
in
september
of
1973
about
a
series
of
thefts
from
the
terminal
railroad
association
facility
in
st.
louis.
the
parties
also
stipulated
that
investigation
of
the
thefts
had
continued
thereafter,
but
that
the
government
had
discovered
only
one
witness
after
september
of
1973
who
might
have
bolstered
its
case.
respondent
attempted
to
support
his
claim
that
the
government
had
possessed
sufficient
evidence
as
of
september
of
1973
to
warrant
presenting
that
evidence
to
the
grand
jury
by
introducing
a
report
that
had
been
prepared
by
the
postal
inspector.
that
report
described
a
series
of
purchases
of
semiautomatic
handguns
from
two
men
in
august
and
september
of
1973,
all
of
which
had
been
stolen
after
mailing
from
the
terminal
railroad
association
in
st.
louis.
the
report
stated
that
the
agents
had
traced
the
weapons
to
a
man
named
joe
boaz
(ph)
and
that
boaz
had
admitted
that
he
had
obtained
the
weapons
from
respondent.
the
report
further
indicated
that
the
postal
inspector
had
interviewed
respondent
in
the
presence
of
respondent’s
attorney
on
september
26th,
1973.
respondent,
who
was
then
working
as
a
switchman
at
the
terminal
railroad
association
and
would
not
have
had
access
to
insured
mail
parcels
in
the
normal
course
of
his
duties,
admitted
to
the
postal
inspector
that
he
had
sold
boaz
four
or
five
weapons.
respondent
attempted
to
explain
his
possession
on
those
guns
by
claiming
that
he
had
found
them
in
a
sack
in
the
backseat
of
his
automobile
after
having
gone
to
the
terminal
railroad
association
to
visit
his
son,
who
worked
there
as
a
mail
handler.
the
report
noted
finally
that
although
respondent’s
son
had
cashed
four
or
five
of
the
checks
given
by
boaz
as
payment
for
the
guns,
the
postal
inspectors
had
no
direct
evidence
that
respondent’s
son
was
responsible
for
the
thefts.
respondent
testified
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
two
possible
witnesses
on
his
behalf
had
died
during
the
18-month
delay
referred
to
in
his
motion,
his
brother
and
a
man
named
tom
stewart.
according
to
respondent,
his
brother
had
died
approximately
one
year
before
the
hearing,
had
worked
at
the
same
place
of
business
as
boaz
and
had
been
present
when
he
had
made
arrangements
by
telephone
to
sell
the
guns
to
boaz.
respondent
claimed
that
stewart
was
his
source
for
two
or
three
of
the
guns
and
that
stewart
had
died
approximately
six
months
before
the
hearing;
again,
however,
respondent
stated
that
he
had
not
disclosed
--
or,
respondent
stated
for
the
first
time,
rather,
that
he
had
not
disclosed
stewart’s
involvement
earlier
because
of
fear
of
retaliation
from
stewart.
respondent’s
testimony
obviously
raised
a
number
of
questions.
for
example,
the
fact
that
respondent
had
told
the
postal
inspector
that
he
had
sold
boaz
only
the
guns
he
had
found
at
the
backseat
of
his
car
and
no
more
was
inconsistent
with
his
assertion
at
the
hearing
that
he
had
obtained
two
or
three
of
those
guns
from
stewart.
similarly,
fear
of
retaliation
from
stewart
could
hardly
have
accounted
for
respondent’s
failure
to
mention
at
the
time
he
filed
his
motion
to
dismiss
stewart’s
involvement,
since
according
to
respondent
stewart
had
been
dead
at
that
time
for
approximately
six
months;
and
furthermore,
at
no
time
during
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
did
respondent
indicate
what
exculpatory
testimony
his
brother
or
stewart
might
have
provided.
despite
these
problems,
the
district
court
dismissed
all
counts
of
the
indictment.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
judge
reagan.
the
court
based
its
dismissal
on
rule
48
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
finding
that
the
government
had
not
adequately
justified
the
18-month
delay
referred
to
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
respondent
had
been
prejudiced
by
the
death
of
tom
stewart,
whom
the
court
characterized
as
a
material
witness
on
his
behalf.
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
dismissal
of
the
possession
counts
and
reversed
dismissal
of
the
count
of
the
indictment
charging
respondent
with
having
dealt
in
firearms
without
a
license.
although
the
majority
credited
the
government’s
explanation
for
the
delay
as
stemming
from
an
effort
on
its
part
to
discover
persons
in
addition
to
respondent
who
may
have
been
responsible
for
the
thefts,
the
majority
nevertheless
concluded
that
the
government
had
not
sufficiently
justified
the
delay
and
then
that
delay
was,
therefore,
unreasonable.
the
court
also
accepted
the
district
court’s
finding
that
respondent
had
been
prejudiced
by
the
death
of
tom
stewart,
adding
without
any
basis
that
were
stewart’s
testimony
available,
it
would
have
supported
respondent’s
claim
that
he
did
not
know
that
the
guns
had
been
stolen
from
the
mails.
it
may
be
worth
mentioning,
since
respondent
has
raised
the
matter,
at
least
briefly,
that
there
is
no
impediment
to
this
court’s
reaching
the
issues
presented
in
the
petition.
it
is
true
that
the
thrust
of
the
government’s
opening
brief
on
appeal
was
not
directed
at
those
issues;
but
the
reason
for
that
was
that
the
district
court
had
based
its
decision
not
on
the
fifth
amendment,
but
on
rule
48
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
which
of
course
is
not
applicable
to
the
pre-accusatory
phase
of
criminal
proceedings.
perhaps
more
importantly,
as
the
opinions
in
this
case
made
clear,
the
panel
expressly
considered
the
issues
presented
to
this
court,
relying
ultimately
upon
a
view
of
the
due
process
clause
that
the
government
disputed
on
rehearing
in
that
court
and
disputes
before
this
court.
the
decision
in
this
case
imposes
upon
the
government,
via
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
a
duty
of
speedy
accusation
roughly
equivalent
to
--
in
some
respects,
more
stringent
than
--
the
speedy-trial
obligations
specifically
imposed
by
the
sixth
amendment.
the
standard
employed
here
for
measuring
the
permissibility
of
pre-accusation
delay
cannot
be
squared
with
this
court’s
decision
in
marion.
indeed,
it
renders
that
decision
largely
meaningless.
our
position
with
respect
to
cases
of
this
sort
remains
what
it
was
at
the
time
marion
was
decided:
that
is,
that
the
due
process
clause
is
not
violated
by
delay
in
the
institution
of
formal
criminal
proceedings
unless
that
delay
was
part
of
an
effort
on
the
government’s
part
to
prejudice
the
defense
or
perhaps,
alternatively,
was
engaged
in
by
the
government
in
reckless
disregard
of
known
risks
of
prejudice
to
the
defense
and
actually
caused
such
prejudice.
at
the
heart
of
the
decision
in
marion
was
this
court’s
conclusion
that
the
disabilities
suffered
by
potential
defendants
did
not,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
begin
to
compare
with
the
disabilities
suffered
by
those
who
are
actual
defendants.
the
potential
defendant
is
not
required
to
live
under
the
stigma
that
almost
inevitably
attends
formal
public
accusation.
the
differences
were
even
more
dramatic
in
the
case
of
defendants
who
are
incarcerated
prior
to
trial.
unlike
the
pre-accusatory
period,
furthermore,
delaying
formal
accusation
until
the
government
has
completed
its
investigation
may
benefit
the
defendant
and
society
in
a
variety
of
ways.
investigation
beyond
the
point
of
mere
probable
cause,
for
example,
may
result
in
the
discovery
of
evidence
exculpating
the
defendant,
thereby
avoiding
unwarranted
or
ill-considered
charges
of
criminal
conduct.
it
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
ameliorating
evidence
and
a
discretionary
decision
not
to
prosecute.
it
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
evidence
indicating
that
the
person
originally
under
suspicion
probably
also
committed
other
crimes
or
that
additional
persons
were
involved,
thus
facilitating
the
resolution
of
related
charges
against
all
in
a
single
proceeding.
it
is
often
made
possible
the
shortening
of
the
time
between
formal
accusation
and
trial.
these
interests
are
far
from
insubstantial.
they
cannot
be
ignored
in
assessing
the
scope
of
the
government’s
duty
under
the
due
process
clause.
it
is
an
exceedingly
serious
matter
to
immunize
from
trial
one
whom
the
government
has
reason
to
believe
is
guilty
of
criminal
conduct.
a
remedy
so
stringent
in
our
judgment
should
be
reserved
for
those
cases
of
affirmative
governmental
misconduct.
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
due
process
clause
is
never
violated
without
proof
of
affirmative
governmental
misconduct;
brady
and
agers
stand
to
the
contrary.
but
the
remedy
for
violation
of
the
government’s
duty
to
provide
the
defense
with
exculpatory
testimony
in
a
brady
or
agers
context
is
not
the
very
stringent
remedy
of
dismissing
all
charges,
immunizing
the
defendant
from
further
prosecution,
but
remanding
the
case
for
a
new
trial.
i
want
to
emphasize
here
as
clearly
as
i
can
that
so
long
as
formal
accusation
is
delayed
pending
further
investigation,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
delay
can
never
be
considered
unjustified,
should
never
be
held
to
constitute
a
breach
of
the
government’s
duties
to
a
particular
defendant.
as
mr.
justice
powell
pointed
out
in
watson,
“good
police
practice
often
requires
postponing
an
arrest,
even
after
probable
cause
has
been
established,
in
order
to
develop
further
evidence
to
prove
guilt
to
a
jury”;
hoffa
is
to
the
same
effect.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
stated
for
the
court
in
that
case:
“law
enforcement
officers
are
under
no
constitutional
duty
to
call
a
halt
to
a
criminal
investigation
the
moment
they
have
the
minimum
evidence
to
establish
probable
cause,
a
quantum
of
evidence,
which
may
fall
far
short
of
the
amount
necessary
to
establish
guilt
to
a
jury.”
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest,
however,
that
the
public
policies
making
delay
in
the
institution
of
formal
criminal
proceedings,
an
inevitable
and
desirable
part
of
the
criminal
process,
necessarily
eliminates
all
concern
with
the
expeditious
enforcement
of
the
criminal
laws.
there
may
be
times
--
hopefully,
they
will
be
rare
--
when
delay
in
formal
accusation
is
the
result
of
efforts
on
the
government’s
part
to
prejudice
the
defense
and
such
prejudice
occurs.
there
may
also
be
times
--
we
hope
equally
rare
--
when
the
government
engages
in
delay
in
reckless
disregard
of
known
risks
of
prejudice
to
the
defense
and
such
prejudice
occurs.
as
we
acknowledged
in
marion,
the
due
process
clause
is
available
to
remedy
abuses
of
those
sorts,
which
injures
society,
as
well
as
the
criminal
accused.
but
in
other
than
those
rare
cases,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
courts
to
consider
the
timeliness,
on
an
ad-hoc
basis,
of
criminal
charges
brought
within
the
applicable
statute
of
limitations.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
untied
states
v.
ewell:
“statutes
of
limitation
stand
as
the
primary
guarantee
against
the
bringing
of
overly
stale
criminal
charges.”
they
represent
a
legislative
balancing
of
society’s
interest
in
equitable
law
enforcement
and
the
interests
of
potential
defendants
in
being
freed
from
having
to
defend
themselves
against
charges
of
long-past
criminal
conduct.
to
be
sure,
statutes
of
limitation
were
never
intended
to
immunize
from
judicial
scrutiny
prosecutorial
misconduct,
however
unfair,
occurring
within
the
applicable
limitations’
period;
but
they
do
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
timing
of
decisions
to
prosecute
should
be
or
necessarily
are
affected
both
by
the
need
to
proceed
with
care
and
deliberateness
and
by
a
variety
of
institutional
factors;
the
need
to
assign
priorities,
for
example,
to
the
prosecution
of
some
cases
rather
than
others.
a
standard
for
measuring
the
permissibility
of
pre-accusation
delay,
such
as
that
employed
here,
would
involve
the
courts
in
the
same
process
in
which
congress
is
engaged
in
enacting
statutes
of
limitation.
more
importantly,
we
believe
the
courts
should
avoid
the
kind
of
ad-hoc
inquiry
into
the
permissibility
of
pre-accusation
delay
that
was
engaged
in
here
for
a
variety
of
eminently
practical
considerations.
first,
if
the
standard
in
this
case
were
to
be
used
widely,
courts
would
be
required
in
perhaps
the
majority
of
cases
to
attempt
to
determine
the
point
at
which
the
government
was
obligated
to
take
its
case
to
the
grand
jury.
whether
measured
against
the
standard
of
probable
cause
or
some
other
standard,
a
determination
of
that
sort
would
involve
nearly
insuperable
problems
of
proof.
second,
it
would
make
little
sense
if
the
duty
as
so
conceived
were
limited
to
government
prosecutors.
if
the
due
process
clause
is
construed
as
embodying
a
prompt
accusation
requirement,
that
duty
presumably
would
extend
to
government
investigators
generally.
we
believe
that
judicial
efforts
to
supervise
the
conduct
of
criminal
investigations
by
reviewing
them
at
the
behest
of
individual
defendants
would
have
very
serious
import
for
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
third,
a
prompt-accusation
requirement
would
necessitate
the
holding
of
lengthy
hearings,
trial
before
the
trial,
in
almost
every
case
before
the
required
determinations
could
be
made
with
any
assurance.
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
document
in
detail
the
course
of
the
investigation
leading
to
the
charges,
and
particularly
if
the
hearing
were
held
before
the
trial
of
the
general
issue,
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
provide
a
dress
rehearsal
of
his
case
in
an
effort
to
show
that
the
time
consumed
by
the
investigation
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
at
the
same
time,
the
courts
would
be
required
to
attempt
to
resolve
in
the
context
of
the
particular
case
a
variety
of
essentially
policy
disputes
that
transcend
the
individual
case,
whether
available
prosecutorial
resources
were
appropriately
devoted
to
the
prosecution
in
one
matter
rather
than
another,
whether
the
importance
of
continuing
an
agent
in
an
undercover
capacity
was
more
important
than
proceeding
with
the
prosecution
of
the
particular
defendant
whose
involvement
was
known.
it
is
no
answer
to
suggest
that
delay
for
any
of
these
reasons
is
avoidable
and
is
therefore
chargeable
to
the
government.
in
fact,
they
are
relevant
to
determining
under
the
due
process
clause
whether,
in
light
of
all
the
circumstances,
the
government
has
proceeded
consistently
with
shared
notions
of
fair
play
and
fundamental
decency.
we
thus
submit
that
the
courts
below
erred
in
dismissing
three
counts
of
the
indictment
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
pre-accusation
delay.
the
indictment
was
returned
within
20
months
of
the
offenses
charged,
well
within
the
applicable
five-year
statute
of
limitations.
respondent
neither
alleged
nor
sought
to
show
that
the
government
had
delayed
in
order
to
gain
an
impermissible
tactical
advantage.
neither
has
respondent
ever
suggested
that
the
government
proceeded
in
reckless
disregard
of
known
risks
of
prejudice
to
him.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
first
standard,
the
standard
that
we
specifically
suggested
in
marion,
the
prosecutorial-misconduct
standard,
is
to
some
extent
a
subjective
test,
and
the
evidence
that
would
be
needed
to
sustain
it,
at
least
to
some
extent,
would
be
within
the
hands
of
the
government,
although
the
united
states
attorneys
or
assistant
united
states
attorneys
responsible
for
delay
could
be,
and
i
assume
would
be,
called
to
the
stand
and
asked
to
explain
the
reasons
for
the
delay.
i
don’t
think
that
we
can
assume
that
government
counsel
would
not
answer
those
questions
candidly.
the
second
alternative,
or
perhaps
supplemental
standard,
is
a
good
deal
more
objective,
the
government
proceeding
with
known
risks
of
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
now,
that
standard
and
the
evidence
needed
to
sustain
a
case
under
that
standard
would
not
necessarily
be
within
the
exclusive
control
of
the
government.
if,
for
example,
a
defendant
had
communicated,
as
this
respondent
did
not,
that
evidence
in
his
possession
needed
for
any
defense
he
might
have
to
put
on
was
disappearing
and
the
government,
despite
that
knowledge,
proceeded
to
delay
or
continued
to
delay,
such
evidence
would
go
a
long
way
toward
making
out
a
case.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
i
have
not
discussed
it
with
others.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
i
certainly
am
prepared
to
go
back
to
the
justice
department
and
obtain
the
government’s
position.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
in
this
case,
government
counsel
entered
into
with
respondent
a
stipulation
which
encompassed
these
matters.
i
would
assume
that
in
many
cases,
such
factors
could
be
stipulated
to.
now,
the
governmental-misconduct
standard,
we
fully
anticipate
that
the
case
will
be
exceedingly
rare
in
which
government
counsel
has
affirmatively
engaged
in
the
kind
of
misconduct
we
think
alone
would
violate
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
perhaps
all
of
the
conduct
that
might
be
encompassed
under
the
governmental-misconduct
standard
would
be
also
be
encompassed
--
i
think
it
probably
would
be
encompassed
--
within
the
standard
of
proceeding
in
view
of
known
risks
of
prejudice
to
the
defense.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
elderly
gentleman
is
not
the
defendant,
but
a
witness
or
a
prospective
witness
in
the
case.
i
suppose
it
would,
and
the
reason
is
that
it
will
seldom
be
true
that
the
government
will
know
with
100%
assurance
that
the
anticipated
testimony
of
a
witness
is
going
to
be
false.
that
is
a
decision
to
be
made
by
the
jury,
and
if
the
government
is
98%
sure
that
someone
is
going
to
testify
falsely
and
it
will
be
difficult
to
overcome
that
testimony
and
it
proceeds
to
delay
with
the
full
intent
to
prosecute
at
some
later
time
when
that
witness
may
not
be
available,
i
think
that
that’s
the
kind
of
governmental
misconduct
the
standard
would
encompass.
but
i
also
think
that
it
would
be
encompassed
by
proceeding
the
risk
alternative
formulation;
that
is,
the
government
proceeding,
despite
its
knowledge
that
the
defendant
suffers
a
very
real
chance
of
being
prejudiced
by
any
delay.
now,
in
the
event
the
defendant’s
evidence
is,
in
fact,
in
a
process,
evidence
that
the
defendant
feels
is
needed
is
in
the
process
of
disappearing,
one
of
the
things
he
can
do,
of
course,
is
to
contact
the
united
states
attorney
and
inform
him
of
that
fact.
in
this
case,
respondent
could
hardly
have
claimed
that
the
government
proceeded
recklessly
with
respect
to
the
two
witnesses
he
testified
at
the
hearing
would
have
been
available
earlier.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
of
course,
not.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
a
conversation
of
that
sort
might
go
something
as
follows:
“i
am
innocent”
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
we
are
not
suggesting
for
the
moment
that
the
respondent
here
have
called
the
united
state
attorney
and
said,
”indict
me.”
what
respondent
might
have
done
is
to
say
that,
“i
am
innocent,
the
evidence
or
some
of
the
evidence
i
need
to
establish
my
innocence
may
not
be
available
at
some
point
in
the
future;
but
if
you
are
ever
going
to
indict
me,
indict
me
now”.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
to
defend
against
the
charges.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
he
is.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
of
course,
that’s
true.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
and
we
are
not
contending
for
that
for
the
moment.
the
government,
for
example,
may
learn
from
third
parties
wholly
unrelated
to
the
defense
that
there
was
some
risk
of
evidence
relevant
to
the
case
--
that
there
were
some
risk
that
evidence
relevant
to
the
case
is
about
to
be
lost.
if
the
government
nonetheless
proceeds
to
delay
and
it
could
proceed,
that
would
in
our
judgment
fall
under
the
tests
that
we’re
contending
for
here.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
presumably,
it
would
come
from
third
parties
associated
with
the
case.
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases,
those
people
will
be
as
accessible
to
the
defendant
as
they
will
be
to
the
government
and,
often,
more
accessible
to
the
defendant.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
again,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
a
defendant
put
pressure
on
the
government
to
indict
him.
what
the
defendant
might
do
is
suggest
that
evidence
relevant
to
his
defense
is
about
to
be
lost;
and
again,
that
evidence
can
come
from
third
parties
and
is
going
to
be
the
rare
case
in
which
the
government
engages
in
such
misconduct.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
and
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
couple
of
brief
comments
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gilden
suggest
that
if
the
government
had
done
anything
here
perhaps
this
case
should
not
be
here,
well
then
maybe
it
should
not
be
here
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
united
states
attorney
in
response
to
questions
indicated
that.
furthermore
as
to
additional
witnesses
received
that
to
the
date
of
september
26,
1973
that
is
true,
that
is
there
were
few
additional
witnesses
discovered,
but
not
as
to
the
investigation
itself.
the
eight
circuit
expressly
credited
that
representation
and
none
of
the
less
held
that
the
indictment
in
this
case
should
be
dismissed
finding
that
that
was
not
a
sufficient
justification
for
the
18
months
delay
that
occurred
here.
mr.
justice
stevens,
as
i
recall
yesterday
you
expressed
some
concern
about
having
government
counsel
testify
routinely
in
response
to
motion
such
as
respondents.
i
should
point
out
that
that
is
a
much
greater
problem
under
the
eighth
circuit's
formulation
than
under
what
we
believe
the
due
process
clause
means.
whenever
the
defendant,
under
the
eighth
circuit’s
formulation
has
been
able
to
make
a
facially
credible
allegation
of
prejudice,
the
eighth
circuit
would
have
the
government
come
in
an
attempt
to
formatively
to
justify
any
delay
that
occurred.
the
only
way
that
could
be
done
is
by
having
the
united
states
attorney
or
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
come
in,
attempt
the
document,
the
course
of
the
investigation
at
detail,
saying
who
was
doing
what
at
what
time
for
what
reasons.
government
counsel
might
also
have
to
take
the
stand
under
the
view
of
the
under
the
due
process
clause
as
we
believe
it
should
be
construed,
but
the
enquiry
would
be
much
more
limited.
government
counsel
already
takes
the
stand
in
a
number
of
contexts
for
example
the
one
that
most
readily
comes
to
mind,
are
motions
that
deal
with
some
aspect
to
pre-bargaining
negotiations.
with
respect
to
the
questions
that
you
asked
yesterday
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
government's
position
is
not
that
a
potential
defendant
has
an
obligation
to
ask
to
be
indicted,
he
may
of
course
do
nothing.
the
question
here
is
under
what
circumstances
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
come
into
court
and
say
guilty
or
not,
the
due
process
clause
prevents
the
government
from
trying
me.
now,
we
have
suggested
that
the
defendant
may
make
the
records
showing
in
any
of
several
ways
and
all
my
response
to
your
question
yesterday
was
intended
to
indicate
is
that,
if
a
defendant,
a
potential
defendant
had
indicated
that
if
the
government
delayed
in
reaching
a
decision
whether
to
prosecute,
he
might
be
prejudiced,
he
would
be
in
a
stronger
position
to
claim
immunity
from
prosecution.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
record
is
a
bit
unclear,
the
record
certainly
is
clear
that
mr.
lovasco
called
the
postal
inspector
on
several
occasions,
now
the
record
indicates…
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
he
had
no
time.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
i
think
the
record
is
precisely
the
contrary,
that
what
the
record
shows
is
that
mr.
lovasco
said
when
he
was
interviewed
that
he
had
--
the
only
guns
he
had
sold
or
guns
he
had
found
in
the
back
seat
of
his
car,
not
until
the
motion
on
the
hearing
to
dismiss,
did
he
mention
and
then
for
the
first
time,
that
there
were
two
additional
people,
stewart
and
his
brother
and
that
the
guns
in
fact
were
at
least
two
or
three
of
them
came
from
some
other
source.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
he
did
not
call
the
prosecutor,
he
called
the
postal
inspector,
i
think
it
is
a
same
difference…
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
he
did,
but
he
did
not
say
anything
that
we…
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
he
did
not.
what
he
did
is
to
say,
“i
assume,
i
am
anxious
about
this,”
what
he
did
not
do
is
give
the
government
any
cause
to
believe,
that
he
was
about
to
be
prejudiced,
his
ability
to
defend
himself
the
trial
would
be
prejudiced
when
any
delay
would
occur.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
he
could
not
have
said
that
because
he
had
said
earlier
that
he
had
found
all
of
the
guns
he
had
sold
to
boa
as
in
the
back
seat
of
his
car.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
incorrect
your
honor.
as
i
indicated
during
my
presentation
yesterday,
the
district
court
and
again,
i
can
only
refer
you
to
the
district
court’s
order.
the
district
court
based
its
dismissal
in
this
case
on
rule
48
of
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
to
some
extent
that
is
cued
the
proceedings
during
the
opening
round
of
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
issues
presented
here
though
were
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
when
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
decisions,
the
government
petitioned
for
rehearing,
arguing
both,
the
issues
that
we
present
here
precisely
as
we
present
them
here
and
arguing
that
the
district
court
should
have
delayed
reaching
a
decision
till
after
trial.
the
reason
that
was
not
done
earlier
is
that
the
motion
itself
was
especially
inadequate.
the
motion
does
not
contain
an
assertion
that
lovasco
would
have
been
prejudiced
to
trial.
it
only
claimed
the
anxiety
in
concern
and
an
unelaborated
assertion
of
prejudice.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
actually
it
could
come
at
either
point,
there
was
certainly
is…
mr.
john
p.
rupp
if
the
court
is
satisfied
after
having
heard
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
has
suffered
materiel
prejudice
in
once
to
avoid,
having
a
verdict
to
return
which
may
cause
some
prejudice,
i
think
that’s
appropriate.
our
real
concern
here
is
having
these
motions
disposed
off
and
particularly
the
prejudice
aspect
to
the
motion
disposed
off,
before
trial
of
the
general
issue,
before
the
court
has
a
real
opportunity
to
know
precisely
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
our
position
is
that
if
the
court
is
satisfied
before
the
verdict,
that
the
defendant
is
been
prejudiced;
we
fairly
can
appropriately
dismiss
the
indictment
at
that
point
and
not...
mr.
john
p.
rupp
acquit
it,
even
though
the
jury
might
acquit
it…
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
a
problem,
alright
i
am
sorry,
let
me
amend
that.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes
that
is
right
and
i
am
sorry.
that
would
present
a
problem,
if
the
court
would
rule
on…
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes
and
i
am
sorry.
our
position
then
would
be
that
he
should
wait
until
as
we
indicated
in
the
brief
after
the
verdict
is
returned
and
before
judgment
is
been
entered
on
the
brief.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
precisely
what
marion
seems
to
contemplate.
