justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
in
this
very
case,
prosecutor
had
command
us
attorney
to
come
in
and
to
testify.
well,
we
have
got
a
very
large
calendar
in
this
district;
we
just
do
not
have
enough
personnel,
enough
resources
to
put
everything
on
as
we
might
want
as
properly
as
you
might
want.
we
have
to
select
out
the
most
important
and
our
exercise
of
our
discretion,
prosecutorial
discretion,
this
case
sat
on
the
backgrounder
for
a
while,
will
that
be
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
think
you
would
still
prevail
it.
that
is
the
only
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
is
a
practical
matter,
is
not
that
true
in
many
districts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
a
speedy
trial
well,
might
have
a
bearing
out
allâ€¦
