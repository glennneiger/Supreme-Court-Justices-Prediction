chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
chief
justice
rehnquist:
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
1844,
united
states
against
lovasco.
mr.
rupp,
i
think
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah,
but
this
court
doesn’t
have
to
overturn
any
conviction
which
is
achieved
by
a
jury
on
a
charge
of
tactics
such
as
were
made
in
this
case
unless
it’s
satisfied
it’s
in
the
interests
of
justice
to
do
so,
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
case
in
this
court
that
says
it’s
a
responsibility
of
a
person
allegedly
about
to
be
charged
with
a
crime
to
get
in
touch
with
the
u.s.
attorney?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gilden.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
why
should
they
say
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
what
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
what
authority
did
the
man
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
precisely
what
language
in
marion
do
you
rely
on
for
them
to
have
any
duty
to
speak?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
indictment
was
not
dismissed
in
marion,
either,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
wasn’t
there
also
language
in
marion
that
talked
about
tactical
advantage
to
the
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
well,
unless
the
defendant
comes
in
on
his
motion,
and
presumably
he
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
motion
like
that,
and
makes
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
marion
requirements
are
there,
why
is
the
burden
on
the
government
to
go
forward
and
do
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
your
position
under
my
understanding
of
marion
is
correct
if
the
case
you
made
out
on
your
burden
of
proof
satisfied
all
the
elements
of
marion.
but
if
any
of
those
elements
were
left
in
dispute,
then
the
government
could
stand
mute
and
quite
conceivably
properly
win
the
motion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
the
proof
that
a
witness
had
died
without
proof
as
to
what
that
witness
would
testify
is
the
proof
of
actual
prejudice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
the
statute
of
limitations
on
this
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
you're
quite
a
bit
short
of
the
five
years
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
have
less
than
a
third
of
the
time
that
congress
has
said
is
the
reasonable
time
in
which
to
bring
it.
we
will
resume
there
at
10:00
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
arguments
in
united
states
against
lovasco.
mr.
gilden.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
the
justice
department
did
not
sponsor
the
speedy
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
that,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
records,
you
would
find
that
infinitely
more
cases
are
continued
and
postponed
at
the
request
of
defendants
by
a
ratio
of
3-4
to
1;
then
are
now
continued
and
postponed
with
the
request
of
the
prosecution
with
the
all
parts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gilden
are
behind
in
your
criminal
calendars
in
the
eastern
district?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
had
many
cases
like
this
out
there
or
emotions
of
this
kind
have
been
made.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
both.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
was
the
judge
on
that
one
do
you
remember.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rupp,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
75-1844,
united
states
against
lovasco
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
