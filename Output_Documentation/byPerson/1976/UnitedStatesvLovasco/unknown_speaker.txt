mr.
rupp,
may
i
follow
up
on
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question?
i
wonder
if
you
have
given
sufficient
consideration
to
your
answer
that
the
government
prosecutor
would
readily
take
the
stand
in
discovery
in
connection
with
such
a
pre-trial
motion.
is
that
a
considered
position
of
the
government
or
one
you
just
felt
was
an
appropriate
answer
to
a
question
you
might
not
have
thought
through?
unknown
speaker
because
that
would
be
a
rather
dramatic
departure
from
what
i
understand
the
normal
practice
of
prosecutors
to
be
if
they
are
asked
to
testify
about
their
investigation
of
charges
and
the
like.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
it’s
my
concern
about
the
undesirability
of
such
discovery
and
that
type
of
practice
that
makes
me
question
the
wisdom
of
the
test
that
the
government
advances
in
this
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
i
must
confess
that
although
the
words
sound
persuasive
when
you
give
them,
i
have
some
difficulty
thinking
of
concrete
examples
that
fit
your
test.
i
mean,
government
normally,
i
suppose,
wants
to
convict
people
it
believes
are
guilty
of
crimes,
and
what
is
the
kind
of
misconduct
that
might
justify
saying
that
--
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
a
witness,
one
of
the
witnesses,
is
an
elderly
man.
the
government
believes
he
is
going
to
testify
falsely
to
an
alibi,
falsely.
they
are
satisfied
the
crime
was
committed
as
alleged.
if
they
delayed
a
couple
of
months
because
they
thought
he
might
not
be
available
as
a
witness
when
he
was
going
be
a
false
witness,
would
that
justify
a
dismissal
of
indictment?
unknown
speaker
may
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
think
it’s
the
criminal’s
responsibility
to
insist
that
he
be
indicted?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it
you’re
talking
about?
you
said
he
should
get
in
touch
with
the
prosecutor.
unknown
speaker
i
can’t
find
anyplace
in
the
constitution
that
puts
a
burden
on
a
man
to
get
indicted.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn’t
need
to
establish
his
innocence;
he
is
innocent.
unknown
speaker
he
is
innocent
until
he
is
convicted.
unknown
speaker
and
he
is
certainly
innocent
until
he
is
indicted.
unknown
speaker
but,
i
don’t
…
unknown
speaker
and
how
would
the
defendant
find
out
that
the
government
had
that
information?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
understand
it
at
all,
why
this
responsibility
is
on
the
person
that’s
about
to
be
indicted
to
come
forward
and
say,
”you
know,
i
am
about
to
be
indicted,
and
i
wish
you’d
hurry
up”.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rupp
i
asked
to
you
that
argument
of
part
two
of
your
brief,
that
you
just
discussed
that
the
--
when
a
trial
judge
is
met
with
the
motion
of
this
kind
by
the
defendant,
that
he
should
differ
ruling
on
until
after
trial,
you
mean
after
verdict
or
in
case
of
all
the
evidence,
which
is
unclear
to
me?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
could
come
certainly
as
it
could
come
before
trial,
but
what
is
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
your
reasoning,
what
is
your
argument
before
or
after
verdict.
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
jury
might
acquit
it…
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
marion
seems
to
contemplate.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
