ms.
patricia
rosen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
suit
involves
the
constitutionality
of
section
6-206(a)(3)
of
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code.
this
section
authorizes
the
illinois
secretary
of
state
to
suspend
or
revoke
the
driver’s
license,
the
operator’s
license
of
any
motorist
without
a
preliminary
hearing
where
the
licensee’s
driving
record
indicates
that
he
has
been
repeatedly
convicted
of
violations
against
traffic
regulations
indicating
a
disrespect
for
the
traffic
laws
and
the
safety
of
others,
or
a
lack
of
ability
to
exercise
ordinary
and
reasonable
care.
briefly
stated
the
facts,
giving
rise
to
the
instant
suit
where
the
plaintiff’s
license
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
was
suspended
for
two
months
in
november
of
1969.
the
suspension
was
pursuant
to
section
6-206(a)(2)
of
the
code,
which
authorizes
the
secretary
of
state
to
suspend
a
motorist
license
when
he
has
been
convicted
of
three
traffic
violations,
three
moving
violations
within
any
12
month
period.
again
in
march
of
1970,
the
plaintiff’s
operator’s
license
was
suspended
for
a
period
of
two
months,
because
he
was
convicted
of
driving
while
his
license
was
suspended
under
the
previous
suspension.
subsequent
to
these
two
suspensions,
plaintiff
was
issued
three
traffic
citations
which
are
relevant
to
this
suit,
and
he
was
convicted
of
two
citations,
one
in
september
and
one
in
november.
on
march
27th
the
plaintiff
received
notification
from
the
secretary
of
state’s
office
that
a
further
conviction
would
result
in
the
loss
of
his
driving
privileges.
this
conviction
occurred
on
march
31st.
on
may
28th
notice
was
mailed
from
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state,
which
plaintiff
received
on
june
3rd.
this
notice
informed
the
plaintiff
that
his
operator’s
license
was
revoked,
the
revocation
to
become
effective
on
june
6th.
on
june
5th,
the
plaintiff
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
section
6-206(a)(3)
in
seeking
to
enjoin
the
secretary
of
state
from
revoking
his
license
pursuant
to
the
section.
plaintiff
asserted
that
section
6-206(a)(3)
violated
the
due
process
clause
because
it
did
not
afford
individuals
the
right
to
a
separate
hearing
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
order
of
revocation.
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
by
the
district
court,
which
was
conditioned
upon
the
fact,
the
plaintiff
should
apply
for
hardship
license
which
he
did
in
june
and
which
license
was
issued
to
him
in
july.
plaintiff’s
request
for
a
hearing
by
a
three-judge
panel
was
granted
on
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
section,
and
the
three-judge
court
entered
its
memorandum
opinion
in
order
on
january
20th
on
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
specifically
held
the
plaintiff’s
right
to
procedural
due
process
was
denied
by
the
practice
of
the
illinois,
secretary
of
state
under
this
section,
because
a
separate
hearing
on
the
issue
of
revocation
was
not
provided
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
order.
the
district
court
recognized
that
in
practice,
except
the
only
issue
which
was
taken
into
consideration
by
the
secretary
of
state’s
office
prior
to
revocation
was
the
accumulation
of
points
and
these
points
were
accumulated
by
a
particular
driver
through
his
being
convicted
of
specific
traffic
offences.
each
offence
being
designated
a
specified
number
of
points.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes
your
honor,
he
was
afforded
the
opportunity
for
full
judicial
hearing
on
each
one
of
the
underlying
convictions.
ms.
patricia
rosen
three,
the
last
suspension
would
have
been
for
three
traffic
violations.
so,
he
was
convicted
on
three
moving
violations.
ms.
patricia
rosen
no,
the
plaintiff’s
class
was
never
certified.
while
the
district
court
recognized
that
the
points
were
the
only
factors
which
the
secretary
took
into
consideration,
the
district
court
determined
that
because
this
particular
statutory
section
stated
that
the
motorist
must
lack
due
respect
for
the
traffic
laws
and
the
safety
of
other
motorist
upon
the
highway,
that
a
separate
hearing
to
determine
these
issues
would
be
required.
procedural
due
process
would
require
such
a
separate
hearing
prior
to
the
revocation
or
suspension
of
a
motorist
license.
we
assert
that
this
was
erroneous.
the
fact
underlying
each
of
the
convictions
which
any
motorist
would
receive
in
traffic
court
have
been
judicially
determined
in
a
hearing
which
provides
every
individual
motorist
with
all
of
the
safeguards
which
are
required
by
the
concept
of
due
process.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes
your
honor,
the
plaintiff,
in
the
instant
case
had
been
convicted
of
three
traffic
violations
within...
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes
your
honor,
i
do
know.
ms.
patricia
rosen
your
honor,
let
me
attempt
to
answer
your
first
question
and
then
i
will..
ms.
patricia
rosen
thank
you.
first
of
all,
your
honor
was
asking
for
what
precise
reason
the
man’s
license
was
revoked
under
this
particular
circumstance
and
i
would
like
to
address
that
question
first,
if
i
may.
the
revocation
which
took
place
under
section
6206(a)(3)
was
entered
because
the
languages
in
the
statuette
has
--
the
motorist
has
been
repeatedly
convicted
of
violations,
and
if
one
takes
a
look
at
the
rules
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
state’s
office,
the
rules
are
reprinted
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
one
will
see
that
rule
6206(a)(3)
specifically
states
that;
a
motorist
to
his
accumulated
sufficient
points
to
warrant
a
second
suspension
within
five
years
may
either
be
suspended
or
revoked
by
the
secretary
of
state,
based
upon
the
number
of
points
in
his
record.
a
person
who
has
been
suspended
thrice
within
a
ten
year
period
shall
be
revoked.
ms.
patricia
rosen
well
your
honor
that
is
the
second
point
that
was
raised
that
the
power
or
the
authority
which
is
exercised
by
the
secretary
of
state
under
these
sections,
the
6206
section
is
discretionary,
and
we
submit
that
that
it
is
true
that
the
secretary
has
however
made
a
determination
in
his
discretion,
and
initial
determination...
ms.
patricia
rosen
well,
your
honor..
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
correct.
however
we
submit
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
separate
independent
hearing
here.
the
reason
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
separate
independent
hearing
has
to
relate
back
to
the
fact
that
the
secretary
has
initially
in
his
discretion
promulgated
a
point
system,
and
this
point
system
is
comprehensive
and
it
takes
into
consideration
variable
factors.
it
does
not
simply
state
that
if
you
are
speeding
on
the
highway
for
example,
you
will
receive
50
points.
speeding
was
one
of
the
examples
which
the
plaintiff
points
up
in
his
brief,
and
he
says
there
are
many
factors...
ms.
patricia
rosen
but
he
does
say
that
your
honor
in
the
point
system
itself,
that
is
true,
he
does
not
specifically
--
the
statue
does
not
say
that
the
suspensions
or
revocations
under
the
section
are
mandatory
but
the
suspensions
or
revocations
are
governed
solely
by
the
points.
if
you
receive
110
points
you
will
be
revoked,
that
is
the
way
the
point
system
operates
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
rule
6204.
it
is
the
rule
which
specifically,
which
is
reprinted
in
our
reply
brief.
it
is
the
rule
which
specifically
discusses
what
the
point
system
is
intended
to
do,
and
this
rule
specifically
states,
it
is
reprinted
on
page
8
of
our
reply
brief.
that
the
secretary
of
state
shall
promulgate
a
point
system
as
a
standard
in
determining
whether
to
suspend
or
revoke
driving
privileges
and
to
determine
the
period
of
suspension
or
revocation.
he
does
not
say
that,
“i
will
suspend
this
motorist
with
75
points,
and
this
one
with
75
points,
i
will
let
go”.
he
suspends
or
revokes
based
upon
the
number
of
points
and
the
motorist
driving
record,
and
that
is
the
only
factor
which
he
takes
into
consideration.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes
your
honor
there
is.
ms.
patricia
rosen
not
until
after
he
is
suspended
or
revoked.
the
reason
for
this...
ms.
patricia
rosen
well
he
can
apply
for
hardship
license
your
honor,
and
also
there
are
special
rules
or
special
protections
for
individuals
who
operate
a
commercial
vehicle
or
who
drive
for
an
occupation.
ms.
patricia
rosen
he
was
informed
when
he
received
the
notice
of
revocation
that
he
had
a
right
to
request
to
hearing
under
section
2118,
that
is
standard.
if
you
request
such
a
hearing
and
he
has
a
license
to
operate
a
commercial
vehicle,
he
will
automatically
be
issued...
ms.
patricia
rosen
he
was
told
that
he
had
the
right
to
request
the
hearing,
he
chose
not
to
do
that.
ms.
patricia
rosen
i
do
not
really..
ms.
patricia
rosen
it
does
not
really
specify..
ms.
patricia
rosen
i
do
not
think
you
know
the
specific
amount
of
points,
i
believe
you
have
to
call...
ms.
patricia
rosen
well
it
is
governed
by
the
regulation
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
state’s
office,
and
i
think
that
what
the
common
or
what
the
ordinary
driver
or
motorist
is
aware
of
or
the
only
thing
which
he
would
actually,
is
common
knowledge,
is
that
if
you
receive
three
moving
violations
within
a
12-month
period,
you
receive..
ms.
patricia
rosen
it
is
governed
by
the
particular
number
of
points
which
you
have
accumulated
within
that.
ms.
patricia
rosen
you
would
have
to
go
and
check
the
records.
there
is
no...
ms.
patricia
rosen
either
call
or...
ms.
patricia
rosen
well
your
honor,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
what
the
secretary
has
attempted
to
do
in
his
discretion
is
the
same
thing,
he
would
do
if
he
brought
in
every
single
motorist
who
was
convicted
of
three
moving
violations
within
a
period
of
twelve
months.
if
he
would
look
at
the
nature
of
the
violation,
he
would
look
at
where
it
occurred,
he
would
look
at
whether
the
weather
conditions
where
clear
or
adverse.
ms.
patricia
rosen
he
does
not
do
it
now,
and
the
reason
he
does
not
do
it,
is
he
has
already
done
it
in
a
very
general
way
and
promulgated
the
point
system,
and
this
system
is
uniformly
applied.
what
he
would
have
to
do
if
he
did
not
have
the
point
system
is
call
the
motorist
in
and
say,
“what
was
the
weather
like
on
the
day,
this
occurrence
took
place,
were
you
in
a
school
zone
or
were
you
on
a
highway?
he
would
have
to
go
through
all
this
--
all
of
this
is
already
done,
he
has
done
it
and
he
has
published
a
list
of
regulations
and
in
that
list
of
regulations
he
says,
“if
you
are
speeding
1
to
10
miles
per
hour
over
the
limit
in
clear
conditions,
i
am
going
to
give
you
6
points
for
that.
ms.
patricia
rosen
no,
they
are
not
in
this
particular
record.
but,
unless
someone
is
asserting
that
one
of
those
regulations
is
such
a
blatant
abuse
of
the
secretary’s
discretion,
i
do
not
really
see
how
that
point
is
relevant.
he
is
doing
the
same
thing
on
a
general
basis
and
applying
it
to
everyone
that
he
would
do
on
an
individual
basis,
if
each
motorist
came
in
to
him
with
their
particular
problems
and
he
is
applying
it
uniformly.
it
was
initially
an
exercise
of
discretion
when
he
promulgated
the
standards.
but
unless
someone
asserts
that
the
standard
is
promulgated,
are
patently,
unreasonable
and
abuse
of
his
discretion,
i
think
that...
ms.
patricia
rosen
at
least
if
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulations
to
my
knowledge
was
not
an
issue
in
this
appeal
as
i
understood
it,
the
primary
issue
which
we
were
to
be
addressing
is
whether
the
secretary’s
discretionary
authority
--
ms.
patricia
rosen
well,
the
court
did
not
really
reach
that
question
because
they
decided
this
as
a
preliminary
matter
that
there
was
an
absolute
requirement
under
the
doctrine
of
procedural
due
process,
was
an
absolute
requirement
for
a
hearing
and
at
that
hearing,
the
district
court
did
not,
the
three-judge
court
did
not
at
anytime
to
my
knowledge,
rule
or
even
discusses
the
reasonableness
of
--
the
point
system
is
promulgated
by
the
secretary.
what
they
said
was
that
in
addition
to
the
point
system,
there
had
to
be
an
independent
hearing
on
the
issue
of
disrespect
for
the
traffic
laws
or
in
the
alternative,
reasonable
or
due
care.
and
what
we
are
asserting
is
if
you
accept
the
point
system
as
promulgated
as
an
exercise
of
discretion,
which
was
within
the
secretary’s
authority
and
that
question
was
not
disputed
by
the
district
court.
what
the
district
court
specifically
said
was
we
accept
that
this
is
the
way
--
and
that
is
on
page
(a)(6),
i
believe
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court.
in
the
second
sentence
appearing
on
that
page,
the
court
states,
“apparently
in
practice
the
accumulation
of
points
is
the
only
fact
which
is
considered
in
determining
whether
to
suspend
or
revoke.
but
neither
the
statute
nor
the
regulations
sanctions
the
disregard
of
the
conditions
of
lack
of
ability
to
use
due
care
or
disrespect
for
traffic
laws
in
the
safety
of
others.
so
long
at
least
as
illinois
law
makes
a
determination
of
the
existence
of
such
lack
of
ability
or
disregard
a
condition
to
revocation
or
suspension.
a
licensee
must
be
given
a
hearing
on
those
issues
before
his
license
can
be
suspended
or
revoked.
court
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
secretary
was
not
authorized
to
promulgate
the
point
system
or
that
the
system
has
promulgated
is
in
any
way
an
abuse
of
his
discretion.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
right
and
the
reason
which
they
give
for
that,
not
to
be
true
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
disrespect
for
the
traffic
laws
and
safety
of
others
and
i
submit
that
the
regulation
which
i
submitted
to
the
court
earlier,
6204
says
that
the
standard
to
be
used
by
the
secretary
determining
those
questions
is
the
point
system.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
well
under
section
2118,
the
individual
motorist
is
informed
at
the
time
he
is
revoked
or
suspended,
that
he
has
the
right
to
a
hearing
which
he
can
request
and
the
secretary,
in
which
the
secretary
must
set
a
date
with
for
the
hearing
within
20
days,
the
hearing
to
be
held
as
soon
as
practical.
and
this
is
a
full
adjudicatory
determination
at
which
a
court
reporter
is
present,
evidence
is
taken
down.
and
basically
what
the
motorist
has
an
opportunity
to
do
in
this
instance
is
that
even
though,
there
has
been
an
initial
determination
with
which
the
secretary
cannot
argue,
that
is
this
motorist
has
been
careless
enough
to
create
a
high
probability
of
risk
to
other
motorist
on
the
highway,
he
has
been
convicted
on
repeated
traffic
violations.
at
this
hearing
the
motorist
has
an
opportunity
to
bring
in
any
additional
mitigating
factors
which
were
not
presented
at
the
trial
on
the
initial
offence.
ms.
patricia
rosen
he
did
not
request
it
your
honor,
he
immediately
went
to
district
court
and
filed...
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
correct.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
we
submit
that
since
the
individual
motorist
under
such
circumstances
has
had
opportunities
for
full
hearings
on
each
of
the
underlying
convictions
that
the
principles
of
due
process
are
not
violated
by
allowing
those
convictions
to
stand
as
prima
facie
evidence
that
this
person
is
a
reckless
motorist.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
one
of
the
leading
cases
in
the
area
of
whether
a
hearing
is
required
prior
to
suspension
or
revocation
was
this
courts
decision
in
bell
v.
burson
and
this
was
cited
by
both
parties
and
i
would
like
to
point
out,
that
i
believe
that
our
situation
comes
within
the
requirements
of
that
bell
v.
burson.
in
bell
v.
burson,
this
court
struck
down
georgia’s
financial
responsibility
law
and
they
did
it
because
the
state
did
not
provide
any
type
of
pre-revocation
or
suspension
hearing.
but
in
doing
so,
the
court
did
not
say
that
georgia
had
to
completely
prove
the
issue
of
fault,
which
was
really
the
question.
all
the
court
required
was
that
the
state
holds
a
hearing
to
determine
a
reasonable
probability
of
fault
and
that
if
such
a
reasonable
probability
existed
they
would
be
justified
in
suspending
or
revoking
a
driver’s
license,
and
we
submit
that
certainly
an
individual
who
has
been
repeatedly
convicted
of
offences
against
the
regulation
and
movement
of
traffic
is/has
already
demonstrated
a
reasonable
possibility
or
even
probability
of
risk
to
other
motorist
on
the
highway.
once
this
has
been
accomplished,
of
course,
at
a
later
time,
the
state
has
a
strong
interest
in
removing
such
individuals
promptly
from
the
highways.
so
that
they
will
not
be
involved
in
other
traffic
incidents
which
might
result
in
death
or
personal
injury
or
property
damage
to
other
more
careful
motorist
on
the
highways.
of
course
due
process
would
require
a
post-suspension
hearing
and
that
requirement
is
unquestionably
satisfy
hear
by
section
2118.
we
submit
that
a
further
pre-suspension
or
pre-revocation
hearing
is
not
required,
because
the
individual
have
already
had
full
adjudicatory
hearings
on
traffic
violations
which
are
sufficient
to
demonstrate
a
high
probability
of
risk.
this
probability
of
risk
justifies
the
state
in
acting
summarily
to
remove
temporarily
at
least
these
people’s
licenses
until
full
hearing
can
be
had.
ms.
patricia
rosen
i
am
not
sure,
i
understand...
ms.
patricia
rosen
no,
that
is
correct.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
situation
is
very
analogous,
because
i
think
when
the
police
feel
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest
someone,
they
are
allowed
to
this
because
to
allow
this
individual
to
remain
on
the
streets,
creates
a
risk
to
the
rest
of
the
society.
and
similarly
in
this
case,
i
feel
that
once
an
individual
has
repeatedly
demonstrated
careless
driving
habits
which
have
caused
him
to
violate
traffic
ordinances
or
regulations
which
are
obliviously
enacted
for
the
safety
of
motorist
on
the
highways.
the
state
has
justified
it
that
time
in
taking
summary
action
to
remove
such
a
person
from
the
highways
before
he
does
serious
damage,
either
to
himself
or
to
other
individuals
on
the
highways.
ms.
patricia
rosen
your
honor,
he
would
have
to
do
precisely
what
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
did.
ms.
patricia
rosen
he
would
have
to
apply
to
the
secretary
of
state’s
office,
and
all
you
have
to
demonstrate
in
order
to
get
a
hardship
license
is
that,
it
is
causing
you,
you
need
your
car
to
get
to
and
from
work
would
be
sufficient
grounds
for
the
secretary.
ms.
patricia
rosen
right,
that
would
be
another
instance
in
which
you
would
be
able
to
drive
pending
the
outcome
of
the
administrative
hearing,
under
those
circumstances.
ms.
patricia
rosen
well
your
honor,
i
can
answer
you
specifically.
in
this
case,
i
believe
the
plaintiff
applied
on
june
10th
for
the
hardship
license
and
it
was
granted
on
july
25th.
there
is
a
hearing
involved
but
the
hearing
is
not
in
any
way
analogous
to
the
hearing
that
is
held
under
section
2118
with
extended
length
of
time
due
to
the
fact
that
testimony
and
evidences
taken
at
the
brief
hearing.
so,
i
would
say
anywhere
from
three
to
four
weeks
would
probably
be
adequate
time.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
if
an
individual
drives
for
a
living
--
oh
i
see
my
time
is
expired.
ms.
patricia
rosen
okay,
if
an
individual
drives
for
a
living
he
is
automatically,
if
he
requests
the
hearing,
he
is
given
a
license
to
drive
depending
the
outcome
of
their
hearing.
so,
there
are
special
protections
for
individuals
who
make
their
living
through
the
use
of
driving.
however,
those
particular
protections
were
not
involved
in
this
case,
because
the
plaintiff
here
did
not
request
a
hearing.
a
mention,
i
would
like
to
assert
that
we
believe
that
the
hearing
which
is
given
on
each
of
the
underlying
traffic
convictions
is
more
than
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
process
requirements
of
a
hearing
prior
to
suspension
or
revocation,
and
that
a
further
independent
hearing
by
the
secretary
of
state’s
office
should
not
be
required,
and
we
will
ask
the
decision
of
the
district
court
be
reversed.
thank
you.
ms.
patricia
rosen
just
a
point
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
reproduced
in
the
appellant?s
brief,
in
the
appendix
at
page
b(4)
is
a
section
which
counsel
was
discussing
with
the
court
about
revoking
the
license
of
a
commercial
driver.
and
in
fact,
this
--
ms.
patricia
rosen
b4,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
this
section
does
provide
that
in
order
to
revoke
the
license
of
a
commercial
driver
in
his
occupation,
he
must
have
been
convicted
of
five
moving
violations,
at
least
two
of
which
occurred
while
operating
a
commercial
vehicle
in
connection
with
his
regular
occupation.
however,
the
statute
goes
on
to
provide
further
that
he
must
either
submit
an
affidavit
in
writing
to
the
secretary
of
state,
informing
the
secretary
of
state,
the
number
of
offences
committed
while
driving
a
commercial
vehicle
in
connection
with
his
regular
occupation,
or
in
the
alternative,
he
must
request
a
hearing
under
section
2118.
if
he
does
neither
one
of
those
things,
the
statute
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
secretary
may
revoke
or
suspend
the
license
of
such
person
to
drive
any
vehicle,
if
he
does
neither
one
of
those
things.
now,
he
can
either
submit
an
affidavit
or
request
a
hearing,
and
the
plaintiff
in
the
yesterday
case
did
neither
one
of
those
things.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
correct.
the
secretary
of
state
will
send
such
a
driver
licensed
to
drive
a
commercial
vehicle
in
his
occupation
pending
the
outcome
of
the
administrative
hearing.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
correct.
ms.
patricia
rosen
the
same
effect.
ms.
patricia
rosen
he
certainly
--
or
request
a
hearing
and
he
did
neither
one
of
those
two
things.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
correct,
he
was
notified
by
letter
that
they
were
about
to
suspend
his
license
and
instead
of
submitting
an
affidavit
or
requesting
a
hearing
under
2118,
he
filed
an
action
in
district
court
seeking
an
injunction.
ms.
patricia
rosen
the
notice
of
revocation
on
the
back
does
say
you
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
under
section
2118,
but
he
did
not
request
that.
ms.
patricia
rosen
no,
there
is
no
such
evidence.
the
speeding
violations
were
--
ms.
patricia
rosen
right?
ms.
patricia
rosen
right,
that
is
correct.
as
to
the
revocation
which
counsel
was
talking
about,
the
license
was
revoked
not
because
--
it
was
because
of
the
three
speeding
tickets
but
that
was
the
basis
for
the
third
suspension,
and
because
he
was
suspended
three
times
?
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
correct,
since
the
secretary
of
state,
although
he
knows
that
the
driver
has
the
license,
that
is
a
license
to
drive
a
commercial
vehicle,
he
has
no
knowledge
as
to
how
many
--
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
absolutely
correct,
there
are
special
protections
for
individuals
who
drive
commercial
vehicles
as
an
occupation.
ms.
patricia
rosen
he
was
notified
that
his
license
was
to
be
revoked,
your
honor.
that
is
correct,
and
he
was
also
notified
--
ms.
patricia
rosen
i
do
not
understand
the
question
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
your
honor,
what
i
said
was
at
the
time
his
license
is
revoked,
not
before,
but
at
the
time
he
knows
his
license,
he
got
notification
first
of
all,
before
his
license
was
revoked
that
it
was
going
to
be
revoked
on
the
27th
of
march.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
they
note
that
on
march
27th,
he
was
notified
that
one
more
conviction
would
result
in
the
loss
of
his
driving
privileges,
and
on
march
31st
of
the
same
year
he
was
convicted.
so,
he
knew
prior
to
the
conviction
that
if
he
had
one
more
conviction,
he
was
going
to
lose
his
license.
he
could
have
at
that
time
contacted
the
secretary
of
state?s
office
and
said,
?i
have
a
pending
traffic
ticket.
i
am
afraid
i
am
going
to
lose
my
license,
what
should
i
do
if
i
am
convicted??
ms.
patricia
rosen
he
was
sent
a
letter
by
secretary
of
state
informing
him
that
one
further
conviction
would
result
in
the
loss
of
his
driving
privileges.
ms.
patricia
rosen
your
honor,
that
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
ms.
patricia
rosen
i
am
sure
it
is
your
honor,
but
i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
particular
page
in
the
record
at
which
the
letter
appears.
the
district
court
does
refer
to
it
in
their
statement
of
facts
on
page
a(2)
of
the
appellant?s
brief,
the
district
court
states
specifically
on
march
27th,
1975,
this
is
in
the
second
full
paragraph
near
the
bottom.
plaintiff
was
notified
by
letter
that
a
further
conviction
would
result
in
the
loss
of
his
driving
privileges.
the
third
citation
had
been
issued
to
this
plaintiff
on
february
12,
1975
and
his
subsequent
conviction
occurred
on
march
31,
1975.
so,
in
between
his
third
and
final
speeding
ticket
in
his
conviction,
he
was
notified
by
letter
from
the
secretary
of
state?s
office.
if
he
was
convicted
one
more
time,
he
would
--
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
thank
you.
