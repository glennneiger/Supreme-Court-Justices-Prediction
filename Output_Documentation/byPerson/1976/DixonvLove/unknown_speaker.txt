unknown
speaker
did
he
receive
some
kind
of
a
hearing
on
each
one
of
those
violations
or
did
he
have
the
opportunity?
unknown
speaker
how
many
were
there
again?
unknown
speaker
was
this
ever
certified
as
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
why
was
his
license
taken
by
the
secretary
of
state,
was
any
reason
given?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
reason,
or
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
says,
“he
can”
it
does
not
say,
“he
must”.
it
said,
“he
is
authorized
to”
he
is
not
“required
to”.
did
you
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
man
was
a
truck
driver
and
needed
his
license
to
live?
he
did
not
or
did
he?
unknown
speaker
in
your
own
way.
unknown
speaker
the
secretary
of
state
could
either
do
it
or
not
do
it.
unknown
speaker
any
hearing
of
any
kind?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
secretary
of
state.
without
any
hearing
by
the
secretary
of
state
or
any
assistant
of
his
or
anybody
connected
with
the
secretary
of
state,
this
man’s
license
was
revoked.
unknown
speaker
ms.
rosen,
he
does
not
say
that
if
you
do
this,
your
license
will
be
revoked,
he
does
not
say
that.
he
says,
“if
you
do
this,
i
might
do
it”.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anyway
for
the
licensed
driver
to
plead
for
mercy?
unknown
speaker
where?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about,
before
he
is
revoked.
this
truck
driver
is
pulled
out
of
business,
and
he
is
not
given
any
chance
to
go
and
say,
“look,
i
am
poor
truck
driver,
etcetera”.
unknown
speaker
but
did
you
tell
this
man
that?
unknown
speaker
was
he
told
that?
unknown
speaker
ms.
rosen,
how
many
points
had
this
man
accumulated?
unknown
speaker
the
record
does
not
tell
us?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
points
were
assigned
for
each
type
of
violation?
how
does
one
get,
how
many
points,
does
it
tell
us
that?
there
is
a
reference
on
page
c2
that
if
you
have
20
to
44
points,
suspension
up
to
two
months.
but
how
do
you
know
whether
you
have
got
10
points
or
50
points,
if
you
are
just
an
ordinary
driver
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
couple
of
offences,
do
you
know
what
your
points
are?
unknown
speaker
so
the
assignment
of
points
is
not
governed
by
statute
or
regulations
at
all,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
the
regulation
says,
“if
that
happens
you
may
be
suspended
as
follows;
20-44
points:
suspension
2
months,
45-74,
3
months
and
so
forth.
but
how
do
you
know
which
penalty
would
be
applied?
how
do
you
know
if,
maybe,
only
you
have
19
points?
unknown
speaker
but
how
many
points
do
you
know
how
many
points
you
began
with?
how
do
you
know
that
the
secretary
of
state
is
giving
you
the
same
number
of
points
that
somebody
else
is
getting
for
doing
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
go,
what
check,
whether
go
down
to
springfield
and
check
the
records
and
--
unknown
speaker
then
say,
“how
many
points
do
i
have,
and
am
i
getting
the
same
points
as
my
cousin
who
was
convicted
two
weeks
ago
for
(inaudible),
how
many
points
did
he
get,
you
have
to
check
that
way?”
how
do
you
find
out?
i
think
the
tack
on
the
statute
is
that
the
secretary’s
discretion
is
totally
without
any
control
and
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
what
that
control
is?
unknown
speaker
he
do
this
in
his
office,
would
he?
with
the
police
in
front
of
him,
and
that
is
what
he
have
before
him?
would
he
get
the
transcript
of
the
trial
or,
how
does
he
do
this
looking
at
the
weather
conditions..
unknown
speaker
those
regulations
are
not
in
the
record
or
are
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
precisely
what
the
plaintiff’s
complaint
asserted
with
judge
mcgarr
thought,
and
apparently
the
state
did
not
see
it
fit
to
put
something
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
otherwise.
judge
mcgarr
is
quite
familiar
with
your
law
as
you
know.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it,
the
complaint
says,
“the
statute
allows
to
secretary
of
state
total
discretion”
and
you
are
responding,
well
yes,
but
he
is
fined
specific
regulations.
but
my
suggestion
is
if
that
is
your
defense,
should
that
defense
had
been
made
in
the
district
court
where
the
nature
of
this
regulations
and
their
specificity
could
have
been
studied
by
the
court.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
court
says
that
the
suspension
is
not
automatic
based
on
the
number
of
points
accumulated.
unknown
speaker
you
spoke
of
the
hearing
that
he
could
have
requested
when
he
got
the
notice.
unknown
speaker
tell
us
a
little
about
that
hearing
would
have
been.
unknown
speaker
why
didn’t
he
get
that
hearing
in
this
situation?
unknown
speaker
but
this
is
a
post-suspension
hearing,
and
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
you
filed
for
a
hearing
before
the
suspension
takes
effect.
unknown
speaker
in
turn,
the
question
would
be
whether
due
process,
whether
it
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
standards
of
due
process
to
give
prima
facie
effect
to
three
moving
violations
for
the
purpose
of
suspension,
is
that
correct
statement?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
analogous
to
probable
cause
that
justifies
an
arrest
that
takes
place
without
a
hearing
before
the
arrest
is
consummated?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
have
a
hearing
before
you
arrest
a
person
do
you?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
these
three
violations
on
which
there
have
been
full
hearings,
taken
together
constitute
probable
cause
to
support
the
suspension
without
any
hearing
at
the
time
of
the
suspension?
unknown
speaker
what
can
he
do
to
get
this?
you
are
referred
to
some
sort
of
a
temporary
license,
hardship
license
i
think
was
the
term.
what
would
he
have
to
do
to
get
that
while
he
was
waiting
for
a
hearing
if
he
were
to
have
one?
unknown
speaker
tell
us
again
what
that
was.
unknown
speaker
or
if
you
were
a
taxi
cab
driver
that
you
made
your
living
that
way.
unknown
speaker
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
that
kind
of
matter
presented?
unknown
speaker
no,
that
is
your
warning
notice.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
little
more
specific
and
that
was
not
it.
did
it
not
have
something
in
it
about
three
moving
violations?
is
not
that
the
supporting
data?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
to
the
question
then
should
have
been
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
it
is
supported
by
repeated
convictions
not
just
some
vague
manifestation
of
disrespect.
unknown
speaker
but,
do
you
suggest
that's
not
the
three
moving
violations
and
convictions
therefore,
does
not
support
a
conclusion
of
disrespect
or...
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
have
you
interrupted
for
the
moment.
the
counsel
for
the
state
told
us
yesterday,
i
thought
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
this
that
upon
receipt
of
that
notice
of
determination
and
upon
the
termination,
there
is
a
provision
for
a
prompt
hearing
of
some
kind
on
a
hardship
basis.
can
you
clarify
that
a
little
bit
and
tell
us
about
that?
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
notice?
unknown
speaker
is
that
part
of
what
was
described
as
the
hardship?
do
you
get
a
temporary
hardship
license?
unknown
speaker
mr.
latturner,
is
this
point
system
set
out
in
any
written
regulation
that
the
secretaries
out
there
has
promulgated
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
where
does
that
appear?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
in
any
of
the...
unknown
speaker
there
were
some
references
yesterday
to
the
reply
brief,
but
i
--
unknown
speaker
at
what
stage
did
codd
against
velger
require
that?
unknown
speaker
that
is
under
the
regulation
scheme.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
in
the
statute,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
45
to
74
says,
suspension
of
the
three
months.
unknown
speaker
three
months.
unknown
speaker
mr.
latturner,
before
you
get
to
that,
you
say
the
number
of
points
that
your
client
had
was
71.
how
do
we
know
that
from
the
record?
unknown
speaker
you
have
just
given
us
your
computation
of
what
you
think
they
are.
unknown
speaker
looking
at
that
record
at
page
10,
is
that
a
list
of
eight
arrests
from
traffic
violations?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
significance
of
it
having
date
of
arrest?
unknown
speaker
he
was
given
the
ticket
and
not
arrested?
unknown
speaker
not
arrested?
unknown
speaker
by
the
parking
ticket?
unknown
speaker
why
would
they
have
date
of
arrest?
unknown
speaker
even
a
parking
ticket?
unknown
speaker
no,
is
a
parking
ticket
considered
an
arrest
in
illinois?
generally,
an
arrest
is
something
considerably
more
different
and
more
brave
than
a
citation
or
just
giving
of
a
ticket,
particularly,
a
parking
ticket.
unknown
speaker
all
of
these
are,
so
called
moving
violations?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
second?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
skipped
the
third
one.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
103
then,
the
very
first
one?
unknown
speaker
tail
light
and
two
improper
turns.
unknown
speaker
and
what
was
the
fourth
one?
unknown
speaker
triggered
this
action.
unknown
speaker
mr.
latturner,
to
stop
in
effect
that
final
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
would
you
rather
had
it
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
would
you
rather
had
it
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
was
one
with
a
collision
somewhere,
if
i
can
read
these
hieroglyphics,
it
maybe
not.
are
you
representing
there
is
no
collision
at
all
in
all
of
these?
unknown
speaker
but
he
had
at
least
within
six
months
three
speeding
tickets?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
not
a
hazard
in
your
estimation?
unknown
speaker
did
he
object
to
these
speeding
tickets
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
certainly
was
given
an
opportunity
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story
at
the
time
of
the
speeding
charges,
was
he
not?
unknown
speaker
now
his
side
of
the
story
would
have
been,
?yes,
i
was
speeding?
because
presumably
he
does
admit,
he
was
speeding
because
he
did
not
go
in
there
and
defend
or
he
was
convicted.
?yes,
i
was
speeding,
but
i
am
not
disrespectful
on
the
law.?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
matter
of
drawing
lines,
and
as
we
all
know
that
is
what
legislation
is
and
surely,
while
if
you
come
close
to
the
lines
on
every
side,
you
can
make,
i
am
sure,
pretty
extreme
difference.
there
certainly
is
a
qualitative
difference,
isn't
there
between
a
person
who
violates
the
speed
limit
three
times
over
a
six-year
period
as
contrasted
with
one
who
violates
the
speed
limit
three
times
over
a
six-months
period.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
based
--
two
chronological,
two
adjacent
days
and
then
three
in
the
ensuing
year.
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
that
it
was
a
mistake
under
illinois
law
to
revoke
his
license,
or
are
you
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
law?
currently,
under
your
submission
it
was
somewhat
improper
or
erroneous
application
of
the
illinois
law
in
this
case,
but
that
is
a
matter
of
illinois
law.
i
am
not
sure,
that
you
are
attacking
the
statute
as
a
matter
of
the
united
states
constitution.
unknown
speaker
and
did
he
do
that
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
no.
afterwards,
did
he
do
it?
unknown
speaker
and
after
he
showed,
he
was
commercial
driver
he
was
allowed
to
keep
his
license?
unknown
speaker
to
drive
his
commercial
--
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
submission
that
the
full
due
process
hearing
must
take
place?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
is
the
standard
do
you
think
the
state
must
satisfy
before
a
suspension?
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
way
a
state
could
say
that
on
the
undisputed
information
we
have,
probable
cause
to
revoke
has
been
established.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
then
that
the
state
need
to
establish
no
more
at
the
initial
revocation
than
the
possibility
or
the
probability
of
a
violation?
unknown
speaker
what
standards
must
they
satisfy?
under
bell
against
burson
and
related
cases
it
is
just
at
the
most
probable
cause,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
even
if
any
rational
person
would
conclude
that
there
is
probable
cause
for
suspension
based
on
a
series
of
undisputed
conviction.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
question
too,
mr.
latturner,
is
it
your
view
just
focusing
on
this
probable
cause
for
a
moment,
that
if
the
conclusion
of
law
is
that
the
license
should
be
revoked,
that
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law,
the
three
findings
of
fact
do
not
as
a
matter
of
law
establish
probable
cause
for
that
conclusion,
as
with
this
driver,
three
violations
would
not
justify
his
revocation.
unknown
speaker
so
that
on
the
undisputed
facts,
there
was
no
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
action
that
was
taken?
unknown
speaker
what
if
illinois
had
provided
that
upon
any
conviction
for
speeding?
there
is
a
mandatory
revocation
of
your
driver?s
license
for
30
days.
unknown
speaker
you
would
not
have
any
constitutionality
issue
to
that?
unknown
speaker
if
upon
conviction,
they
stamped
your
license
revoked
--
unknown
speaker
at
page
b4?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
requests
the
hearing,
the
license
is
not
revoked
meanwhile?
unknown
speaker
if
he
requests
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
if
he
submits
the
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
and
did
he
have
a
chance
to
submit
the
affidavit
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
because
he
had
a
notice
that
said,
?we
are
about
to
suspend
your
license??
unknown
speaker
of
course
the
notice
did
not
tell
him
what
he
could
do.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
any
evidence
in
this
case
whether
those
three
speeding
violations
occurred
while
he
was
driving
his
commercial
vehicle?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
you,
if
he
had
filed
an
affidavit
that
all
three,
where
while
driving
his
commercial
vehicle
and
he
would
have
to
get
this
temporary
license,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
because
it
takes
five
commercial
speeding
violations
--
unknown
speaker
i
gather
the
system
operates
then
as
if
whether
only
three
and
there
is
a
presumption,
unless
you
abuts
it
by
affidavit
that
all
occurred
while
he
was
driving
a
non-commercial
vehicle.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
i
take
it
that
in
so
far
as
the
commercial
aspect
of
this
case
is
concerned,
the
law
does
provide
at
least
an
informal
mechanism
by
which
the
driver
may
correct
any
misapprehension
of
the
secretary
prior
to
his
license
ever
being
revoked.
unknown
speaker
well
in
this
case,
all
he
got
was
this
revocation,
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
no.
just,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
other
than
this
revocation
slip?
is
there
anything
else
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
before
his
license
was
revoked,
he
was
given
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
but
he
was
not
sent
a
letter
by
the
secretary
of
state
telling
him
that.
unknown
speaker
and
that
letter
is
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
is
the
entire
record
filed
here?
