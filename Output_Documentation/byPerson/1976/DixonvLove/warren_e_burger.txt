i
want

the
nature
in
this
setting
of

of

are
they
not,
which
are
not
challenged
here?
chief

e.

all
correct.

not
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
state
saying
that
the

is
cancelled
under
the
point
system
pursuant
to
the

in

of
a
conclusion
of
law
from
the
admitted
undisputed
findings
of
fact
that
he
has
three
convictions
plus
some
other
violations.
