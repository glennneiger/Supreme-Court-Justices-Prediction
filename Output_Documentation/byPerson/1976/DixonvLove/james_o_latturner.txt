mr.
james
o.
latturner
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
order
to
fully
and
adequately
understand
the
secretary
of
state's
action
in
this
case.
it
is
necessary
for
a
full
consideration
of
the
entire
statutory
and
regulatory
scheme
set
up
by
the
state
of
illinois
and
under
which
the
secretary
of
state
acts.
illinois
provides
two
basic
statutory
sections
regarding
the
revocation
of
driver?s
licenses.
they
are
found
in
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code.
the
first
section
6-205
and
the
second
section
6-206.
the
secretary
acted
under
section
6-206
which
provides
for
the
discretionary
revocation
or
suspension
of
driver?s
licenses.
for
comparison,
i
would
first
like
to
consider
section
6-205.
section
6-205
is
clearly
headed
mandatory
revocation
of
driver?s
license
and
provides
that
the
secretary
of
state
shall
forthwith
revoke
a
driver?s
license
upon
receiving
the
report
of
the
conviction
of
various
traffic
crimes,
such
as
drunken
driving,
three
instances
of
reckless
driving
and
various
others.
not
only
is
his
action
mandatory,
but
at
the
end
of
the
traffic
court
proceeding
where
these
convictions
take
place,
the
licensee
must
surrender
his
driver?s
license
to
the
clerk
or
the
judge
of
that
court.
the
clerk
or
judge
in
turn
forwards
the
license
to
the
secretary
of
state
who
now
needs
only
to
stamp
it
revoked.
the
secretary
of
state
must
revoke
it.
he
has
no
discretion
to
take
any
other
action
on
that
license.
in
start
contrast
to
this
mandatory
revocation
provision,
we
have
section
6-206.
this
is
the
provision
which
the
secretary
of
state
acted
under
the
present
case.
this
is
clearly
headed
discretionary
authority
to
suspend
or
revoke
licenses.
it
gives
the
secretary
of
state,
the
authority
to
revoke
licenses
upon
the
happening
of
the
determination,
certain
events
have
happened.
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
love?s
license
was
revoked
as
stated
in
the
notice,
because
his
driving
record
indicated
a
disrespect
for
the
traffic
laws.
other
discretionary
revocations
under
section
6-206
even
include
non-feloniously
violating
any
provision
of
the
motor
vehicle
code.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
your
honor,
he
was
notified,
this
action
has
been
taken
as
a
result
of
your
having
been
repeatedly
convicted
of
offenses
against
laws
and
ordinances
regulating
the
movement
of
traffic
to
a
degree
which
indicates
disrespect
for
the
traffic
laws.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
but
they
have
to
make
the
determination
of
disrespect
and
again
the
comparison...
mr.
james
o.
latturner
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
under
the
statutory
scheme,
a
commercial
driver
is
allowed
to
fight
convictions
prior
to
the
time
his
commercial
license
is
revoked.
mr.
love
is
a
commercial
driver
which
the
secretary
of
state
well
knew
since
his
driver
classification
is
on
the
abstract
of
record.
in
this
case,
his
commercial
license
could
not
be
revoked,
yet
in
fact,
it
was
without
any
prior
hearing.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
there
is
no
provision
whatsoever
for
a
prompt
hearing.
you
can
apply
for
a
hardship
license.
you
also
can
apply
for
a
full
post
revocation
under
section
2-118
of
the
code.
the
hardship
procedure
is
a
part
of
the
2-118
proceeding.
you
have
to
apply
in
writing,
and
by
the
way,
i
should
add
first
on
the
notice
given
to
the
licensee
that
his
license
is
revoked.
in
big
letters
at
the
bottom
of
it
is
?your
license
must
be
surrendered
immediately.?
the
entire
notice
has
been
reproduced
in
the
form
that
it
is.
the
license
is
then
surrendered
in
effective
revocation
in
itself.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
notice
is
at
page
13
of
the
appendix.
the
licensee
may
then
file
a
written
request
for
a
hearing
under
section
2-118.
the
secretary
of
state
does
not
have
to
respond
to
that
request
for
20
days.
they
have
20
days
to
respond
to
it.
when
they
respond
to
it,
the
response
is
to
set
a
date
further
into
the
future.
beyond
the
20
days,
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
that.
it
is
supposed
to
be
within
a
reasonable
time.
after
the
hearing
is
set,
it
is
held,
there
is
then
the
time
for
decision.
during
this
entire
process,
the
license
is
revoked.
the
revocation
is
not
stayed
pending
on
this
hearing.
as
we
have
indicated
again
in
the
abstracts,
our
experiences
on
administrative
proceedings
before
the
secretary
of
state
regarding
driver?s
licenses,
the
process
from
the
time
of
the
request
to
the
time
of
decision
runs
anywhere
from
three?and-a-half
months
to
over
nine
months.
during
this
time,
the
license
is
revoked.
there
is
no
prompt
hearing,
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
done
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
revocation
to
save
the
license.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
the
hardship
license
is
a
part
of
the
2-118
hearing.
we
got
a
special
one
in
this
case,
because
after
filing
the
action,
the
revocation
was
stayed
pending
a
hearing
on
hardship
which
the
district
court
ordered
separate
and
apart
from
a
regular
2-118
hearing.
it
took
them
a
month-and-a-half
to
make
that
decision
from
june
10th
until
july
25th.
going
back
again
to
the
statutory
scheme
under
section
6-206,
as
i
have
indicated
is
purely
discretionary.
the
rules
which
the
secretary
of
state
has
promulgated
reinforced
this
opinion.
rule
6-206
clearly
states
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
take
action
or
he
may
decline
to
act
in
contrast
to
section
205,
where
he
must
act.
here
he
has
the
discretion,
even
if
grounds
exist
for
some
reason
not
to
act.
the
statute
section
6-206
further
provides
that
if
he
chooses
to
act,
even
if
a
penalty
of
revocation
is
authorized,
he
may
substitute
an
order
of
suspension
instead.
so
again,
rather
than
a
definite
penalty
that
must
be
imposed,
he
has
the
discretion
to
lower
it
if
he
wishes.
the
secretary
of
state
has
argued
that
despite
this
admitted
discretion,
they
avoid
all
discretionary
decisions
by
the
adoption
of
a
point
system,
but
the
point
system
also
must
be
viewed
in
accordance
with
statutory
and
regulatory
system
within
illinois.
the
point
system
is
provided
for
under
section
6-204
of
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code,
where
they
talk
about
traffic
violations
and
that
section
refers
to
findings
of
guilty
on
traffic
violations
as
evidence
relating
to
unfitness
to
safely
operate
a
motor
vehicle.
the
rule
which
the
secretary
of
state
has
promulgated
section
6-204
which
includes
the
point
system,
specifically
provides
that
he
shall
promulgate
a
point
system
as
a
standard
in
determining
whether
to
suspend
or
revoke
licenses
and
further
that
the
point
system
shall
act
as
a
standard
for
the
secretary
in
determining
whether
such
person
has
due
respect
for
the
traffic
laws.
thus,
we
find
that
the
point
system
is
not
conclusive.
it
is
merely
evidence,
it
is
merely
a
starting
point,
a
guide.
the
secretary
of
state
claims
that
is
the
only
thing
they
consider
that
is
true,
because
they
will
not
allow
the
licensee
to
make
any
presentation
of
other
evidence.
that
is
not
an
excuse.
that
is
actually
a
statement
of
the
problem.
what
we
need
when
the
secretary
of
state
is
considering
some
evidence,
the
traffic
record,
the
right
of
the
other
person
to
the
proceeding,
the
licensee
to
be
allowed
to
present
what
evidence
he
has
in
order
that
there
may
be
a
weighing
of
all
the
evidence.
there
is
no
possibility
whatsoever
for
the
licensee
to
make
any
presentation
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
action.
they
claim
that
after
the
traffic
--
that
there
was
a
prior
hearing
in
traffic
court.
again,
looking
at
the
statutory
scheme,
the
decision
that
is
made
in
traffic
court
under
section
6-206
is
not
conclusive.
remember,
the
decision
made
in
traffic
court
under
section
6-205,
a
separate
section
is
conclusive.
the
license
is
surrendered
in
the
traffic
court.
under
section
6-206,
however,
it
is
clearly
contemplated
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
other
decisions
to
make,
decisions
which
are
not
determined
by
the
traffic
court
judge.
first,
the
secretary
of
state
has
to
decide
whether
or
not
grounds
to
exist.
as
the
district
court
found,
he
has
to
make
an
affirmative
determination
that
in
fact
there
is
disrespect
for
the
law.
the
traffic
court
only
decides
single
convictions.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
they
put
that
into
the
section
6-205
scheme,
that
would
be
an
entirely
different
case
and
i
think
that
with
the
surrender
of
the
license
in
traffic
court
that
it
would
meet
due
process,
otherwise
lower
court
cases
that
the
secretary
act,
there
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
in
clerical
error.
we
are
not
challenging
6-205,
we
are
challenging
6-206.
they
are
very
different,
and
the
difference
points
up
for
due
process
problems.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
point
system
itself
is
set
forth
under
section
6-204
which
is
not
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
it
was
attached
to
the
secretary?s
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
trial
court
and
it
would
be
found
in
the
record
as
...
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
full
point
system
is
not
in
any
of
the
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
in
the
reply
brief,
they
set
forth
some
of
the
preliminary
regulations
that
it
is
to
be
used
as
a
standard
in
determining
non-fitness.
that
would,
i
am
not
sure
what
page
on
the
reply
brief
it
is
on.
it
would
be
in
there.
page
three
of
the
reply
brief.
it
does
not
have
the
full
point
system.
the
second
decision
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
to
make
under
section
6-206
is
whether
to
take
any
action
at
all
even
if
grounds
exist
and
thirdly
if
he
decides
to
take
actions,
what
particular
action
he
should
take.
this
court
has
recognized
as
recently
as
last
week
in
codd
v.
velger,
that
using
the
example
of
a
parole,
that
there
are
two
separate
considerations.
first,
whether
the
parolee
in
fact,
committed
the
violation
with
which
he
is
charged,
and
second,
if
he
did
commit
the
act
whether
under
the
circumstances
his
parole
should
be
revoked.
and
as
this
court
pointed
out,
even
if
it
is
admitted
that
he
did
the
act,
it
is
still
required
to
give
him
a
hearing
on
what
action
should
be
taken,
and
this
is
the
same
type
of
situation
that
we
have
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
in
the
case
at
bar,
mr.
love?s
driver?s
license
was
revoked.
it
is
the
harshest
penalty
that
could
be
imposed
by
the
secretary
of
state.
the
actions
of
mr.
love
which
triggered
the
secretary?s
revocation
were
minimal
within
the
statutory
scheme.
mr.
stevens
asked
yesterday,
how
many
points
he
had
accumulated.
for
all
of
these
traffic
violations
contained
on
mr.
love?s
record,
his
total
number
of
points
is
71.
under
the
statutory
scheme,
71
points
would
warrant
a
suspension
of
up
to
six
months.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
that
is
under
the
regulations.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
45
to
74
says,
suspension
of
the
three
months.
in
fact
his
last
three
violations
were
49
points,
he
had
22
points
from
prior
violations
for
the
total
of
71.
so,
if
they
are
using
a
points
as
a
guide
it
should
have
been
a
suspension
of
no
more
than
six
months,
here
we
have
a
revocation.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
three
months,
pardon
me.
justice
stevens
also
inquired
yesterday
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
possible
for
a
licensee
to
determine
the
number
of
points
that
has
been
charged
against
him
and
the
answer
to
that
is
also
known.
in
illinois,
you
can
write
the
secretary
of
state
and
for
a
$2.00
fee
you
can
get
your
abstract
of
record.
mr.
love?s
abstract
of
record
is
reproduced
at
page
10
of
the
appendix.
it
lists
all
of
the
violations,
it
lists
any
other
actions
that
have
been
taken,
it
lists
the
type
of
license,
etcetera.
it
does
not
list
the
number
of
points
that
have
been
charged
against
him.
in
order
to
figure
the
number
of
points,
you
have
to
acquire
their
entire
records
as
to
how
many
points
is
given
for
each
violation.
it
cannot
be
done
by
writing
the
secretary
of
state.
the
secretary
of
state
also
attempts
to
justify
summary
action
on
the
basis
of
an
emergency,
and
we
submit
that
an
emergency
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
you
do
not.
you
would
have
to
take
the
violations
indicated
upon
the
record
in
the
appendix
and
go
through
the
voluminous
regulations
which
are
attached
to
the
secretary?s
motion
to
dismiss
and
figure
it
out.
they
have
not
been
computed
within
the
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
an
emergency
situation
which
would
justify
the
suspension
of
due
process
rights
does
not
exist
in
the
case
at
bar.
as
this
court
has
previously
indicated,
in
order
to
have
an
emergency
justifying
such
summary
action,
it
must
be
justified
necessary
in
the
particular
instance.
the
only
emergency
claimed
by
the
secretary
in
this
action
is
to
remove
unsafe
drivers
from
the
highway.
that
does
not
apply
in
the
particular
instance
because
as
the
secretary
also
admits,
they
cannot
properly
revoke
mr.
love?s
commercial
license.
thus,
he
would
be
allowed
to
return
to
the
highway
for
the
major
part
of
his
driving
life.
that
is
because
section
c2,
subsection
c2
of
the
statute
in
question
here
allows
a
commercial
driver
five
violations
prior
to
suspension
or
revocation.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
lists
eight
tickets.
two
out
of
the
six
do
not
pertain
or
are
not
chargeable
against
suspension
or
revocation
of
a
license.
the
first
one..
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
means,
he
was
given
the
ticket,
for
example,
the
first...
mr.
james
o.
latturner
pardon.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
there
are
some
violations
which
apply
towards
potential
suspensions
or
revocations.
there
are
some
violations
that
do
not
apply
towards
suspensions
or
revocations.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
one
for
example
is
driving
without
a
tail
light
on.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
a
ticket
is
determined
to
be
in
arrest.
that
was
all
that
it
means.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
they
do
not
list
parking
tickets.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
answer
your
question
definitively.
it
is
a
practical
matter,
on
the
record,
they
do
not
include
parking
tickets.
they
do
include
all
other
tickets
whether
or
not
they
go
to
a
suspension.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
and
as
i
say,
the
first
one
is
for
driving
without
a
tail
light.
this
has
no
bearing
on
suspension
or
revocation.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
you
mean
the
six
that
he
was
charged
with?
mr.
james
o.
latturner
oh
well,
no
--
see,
the
first
one,
justice
brennan,
was
driving
without
a
tail
light.
for
the
purposes
of
the
suspension
or
the
revocation
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
does
not
count.
the
second
one,
i
think
is
improper
turn.
the
third
one,
i
believe,
is
another
improper
turn.
you
cannot
tell,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
section,
which
i
have
done
prior
to
this
and
i
am
now
relying
on
my
memory.
the
first
two
are
improper
turns,
i
think
one
is
a
left
hand.
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
the
other
one
is.
the
third
one,
if
you
are
looking
at
description
of
action,
the
104901
is
a
speeding
ticket.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
both
the
202
and
the
218
are
improper
turns.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
103
as
i
indicated
was
the
tail
light
was
out.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
right
and
then
speeding.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
fourth
one,
the
action
taken
there
is
the
initial
suspension
in
1970.
that
was
not
a
ticket
that
just
indicates
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
state.
the
fourth
item,
i
believe
is
determination
of
suspension,
which
again
appears
on
the
record
here.
the
fourth
item
is
driving
while
suspended
which
resulted
in
the
next
item
which
is
a
second
suspension.
the
following
item
is
determination
of
that
suspension.
again
under
description
of
action,
if
we
are
now
down
to
the
line
of
106-01-03,
the
following
three
are
speeding
tickets
and
those
are
the
three
that
triggered
this
action.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
last
item,
the
6-206
(a)(3)
is
the
notation
of
this
revocation
that
was
entered
in
the
case
at
par.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
i
have
never
understood.
the
only
emergency
that
the
secretary
of
state
has
alleged
in
the
case
at
bar
is
to
remove
unsafe
drivers
from
the
road.
it
does
not
apply
to
this
situation
because
they
cannot
remove
mr.
love
legally
from
the
road
for
driving
as
a
commercial
driver.
secondly,
they
never
charged
him
with
being
an
unsafe
driver.
they
charged
him
with
disrespect
for
the
laws,
under
a
statute
that
authorizes
them
to
charge
him
with
either
disrespect
for
the
laws
or
disrespect
for
the
safety
of
other
people
on
the
highway.
they
charged
him
only
with
disrespect
for
the
traffic
laws.
secondly,
mr.
james
o.
latturner
pardon.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
have
been
proper
to
charge
him
with
that.
as
you
notice
on
the
traffic
record,
there
are
no
accidents
listed
for
mr.
love.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
in
my
understanding
of
this
record,
there
is
no
collision
on
it.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
does
not
propose
an
emergency
situation
which
justifies
a
suspension
of
the
due
process
clause.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
state
of
illinois
cannot
remove
drivers
that
they
determine
to
be
disrespectful
or
unsafe
from
the
roads.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
they
cannot
do
that
until
after
they
have
given
the
licensee
the
opportunity
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story.
in
fact,
at
the
case
at
bar
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
am
not
sure
if
he
appeared
in
court.
we
did
not
contest
the
findings
of
guilty.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
as
to
the
speeding
charge
itself,
he
was
not
given
the
opportunity
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story
to
the
secretary
of
state
when
the
secretary
of
state
took
action.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
think
he
would
point
out
that
except
for
the
two
groupings
of
tickets
of
three
each
that
there
are
no
other
violations
which
would
lead
to
the
accumulation
of
points
on
his
record.
to
a
large
extent
this
entire
procedure
is
not
how
many
tickets
you
get,
but
how
you
group
them.
in
the
seven-year
period,
it
is
possible
for
another
driver
to
have
been
found
guilty
of
14
speeding
violations,
and
as
long
as
he
never
put
any
three
of
them
within
a
12-month
period,
his
license
would
never
be
revoked
or
suspended.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
well,
you
can
compare
this
in
many
ways.
if
you
have
three
tickets
in
365
days,
you
get
suspended.
if
you
have
four
tickets
in
368
days,
you
do
not
get
suspended.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
basic
purpose
for
the
hearing
with
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case
with
mr.
love
is
they
revoked
his
entire
license,
yet,
he
is
allowed
under
the
statute,
five
violations
before
his
commercial
license
is
revoked.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
right,
one
of
the
purposes
of
due
process
is
to
allow
licensees
such
as
in
the
case
at
bar
to
make
presentations
to
point
out
that
the
policy
is
being
improperly
applied
to
the
facts
at
this
case.
he
has
to
come
forward
with
the
fact
that
he
is
a
commercial
driver,
that
he
has
a
commercial
license.
it
requires
giving
him
the
opportunity
to
make
a
presentation.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
had
no
opportunity
to
prior
to
the
effective
date.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
they
gave
him
a
hardship
license.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
finally
they
gave
him
his
full
license
back
by
order
of
the
court
below.
we
would
also
have
argued
that
under
the
facts
that
if
we
would
have
had
a
prior
hearing
that
the
facts
of
this
case
would
not
justify
the
ultimate
penalty
here
of
revocation.
at
the
very
most
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
oh,
certainly
not,
no.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
at
a
minimum,
they
have
to
give
him
an
adequate
notice
which
apprises
concretely
of
what
he
has
been
charged
with
and
what
his
rights
are.
he
should
then
have
the
opportunity
to
make
an
oral
presentation
to
an
agent
of
the
secretary
of
state
which
could
be
on
an
informal
basis.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
under
the
illinois
statutory
scheme,
no.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
think
they
have
to
have
some
grounds
to
act
which
they
notify
him
of
but
they
have
to
give
him
the
opportunity
to
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
at
the
most,
they
could
notify
him
that
your
record
shows
so
many
tickets
and
give
him
the
right
to
make
any
type
of
presentation
that
he
wants
or
an
informal
hearing
and
act
after
that.
what
we
are
asking
for
is
the
opportunity
for
him
to
talk
through
an
agent
of
the
secretary
of
state
prior
to
the
effective
date.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
there
may
be
probable
cause
for
some
action.
there
is
the
right
to
determine
what
action
should
be
taken.
i
should
note
in
connection
with
that
numerous
states
have
developed
a
system
which
goes
a
little
bit
beyond
the
minimum
that
i
have
just
indicated
which
is
probably
the
most
practical
method
of
handling
that.
send
out
the
notice,
advise
them
of
the
rights,
what
the
basis
of
the
decision
is
and
if
they
request
the
hearing,
then
they
would
stay
the
effective
date
of
the
revocation
until
the
hearing
is
held.
the
state
can
schedule
it
as
quickly
or
as
they
wish.
on
a
practical
level,
i
think
that
would
be
the
most
appropriate
scheme,
but
we
are
not
asking
for
the
full
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
we
are
not
challenging
the
convictions.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
the
point
system
is
merely
evidence.
it
is
merely
a
start.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
he
must
make
the
determination
of
disrespect.
it
is
the
starting
point
for
it,
but
it
is
evidence
that
is
clear
from
the
entire
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
revocation
of
the
commercial
license.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
right.
if
at
all,
license
was
revoked,
that
is
why
we
need
some
type
of
prior
hearing
which
in
the
case
at
bar
could
be
an
informal
conference
to
make
this
known.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
he
would
have
had
five
convictions?
he
would
have
received
a
notice
similar
to
what
he
did.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
we
would
be
objecting.
we
would
have
asked
for
a
hearing
on
the
revocation.
our
preference
here
is
to
work
through
the
administrative
system.
that
is
what
we
are
here
today
for.
not
to
be
presenting
this
to
a
court,
but
to
have
the
opportunity
to
make
the
presentation
to
the
administrative
officer.
obviously,
some
cases
are
going
to
be
lost
before
the
administrative
agency,
but
others
will
be
won.
what
we
need
is
the
right
to
go
through
the
administrative
procedure.
we
do
not
have
that
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
action
here.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
section
6-205.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
we
are
not
contesting
the
constitutionality
of
that.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
and
the
driver?s
license,
a
judge
in
the
traffic
court,
that
is
what
they
do
in
section
6-205,
it
is
very
different
from
the
discretionary
procedure
here.
thank
you.
