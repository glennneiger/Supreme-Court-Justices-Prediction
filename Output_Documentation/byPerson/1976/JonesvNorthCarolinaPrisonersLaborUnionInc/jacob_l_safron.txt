mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
upon
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
eastern
district
of
north
carolina,
holding
that
the
north
carolina
department
of
correction,
under
its
then
announced
policies
could
not
prohibit
the
formation
and
operation
of
the
north
carolina
prisoners’
labor
union
within
the
facilities
of
the
north
carolina
department
of
correction.
the
three-judge
court,
paying
lip
service
to
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
pell
v.
procunier,
cites
pell,
and
then
immediately
proceeds
to
emasculate
the
decision
in
pell,
subvert
the
holding
of
this
court
in
pell,
and
require
the
north
carolina
department
or
correction
to
provide
resources
to
the
north
carolina
prisoners’
labor
union,
and
all
other
organizations
equally
and
neutrally
applied.
we
sought
a
stay
at
that
order.
the
district
court
denied
a
stay.
we
sought
a
stay
from
this
court,
and
a
stay
was
denied
from
this
court.
as
a
result
of
the
denial
of
stays,
it
became
necessary
for
the
department
of
correction
to
issue
regulations
pursuant
to
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court.
those
regulations
are
printed
in
the
respondent’s
brief,
i
believe
on
page
16.
however,
the
respondent
in
printing
these
regulations,
has
failed
to
provide
one
point.
the
purpose
of
these
rules
is
to
regulate
the
activities
of
organized
inmate
groups
not
sponsored
by
department
of
correction
in
compliance
with
the…
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
am
reading
right
now
from
our
regulations.
this
is
not
indicated
in
the
brief,
and
just
one
paragraph.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
the
purpose
of
these
rules
is
to
regulate
the
activities
of
organized
inmate
groups
not
sponsored
by
department
of
correction
in
compliance
with
the
order
issued
by
the
three-judge
panel
in
north
carolina
prisoners’
labor
union
v.
jones,
presently
being
reviewed
by
the
united
states
supreme
court.
the
department
of
correction
reserves
the
right
to
amend
these
rules,
if
that
court
modifies
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
in
this
case,
the
department
of
correction
sought
to
take
a
moderate
position.
the
three-judge
court
acknowledges
the
department
sought
to
take
a
moderate
position.
the
three-judge
court
recognizes
and
admits
that
the
correctional
officials
have
real
and
sincere
doubts
about
this
organization
and
fears
concerning
the
results
that
such
an
organization
might
bring.
yet,
the
three-judge
court
disregarded
those
fears.
now,
we
have
published
regulations.
other
organizations
have
gone
with
those
regulations
and
are
functioning.
the
prisoners’
labor
union
refused
to
comply.
they
filed
their
original
self-serving
declaration
when
they
first
formed
themselves,
which
was
insufficient.
when
we
said
it
was
insufficient,
they
sought
an
order
to
hold
the
correctional
officials
in
contempt.
there
was
as
a
result
an
extensive
plenary
hearing.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
post,
and
i
point
out.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
we
have
issued
these
regulations
because
we
could
not
get
a
stay.
the
court
at
the
contempt
hearing
found
that
the
petition
to
hold
the
defendants
in
contempt
was
sought
--
would
be
so
intend
to
harass
the
defendants,
the
correctional
officials,
and
that
we
had
done
everything
required
of
us.
the
prisoners’
labor
union
does
not
currently
exist,
although
under
the
rules,
if
they
would
properly
apply,
they
could
exist.
anything
that
they
say
concerning
any
benefits
that
the
correctional
system
has
derived
is
mere
puffing
on
their
part.
according
to
the
three-judge
court,
we
opened
the
doors.
we
sponsored
and
recognized
the
jaycees.
it
is
an
organization,
of
course,
with
national
roots
in
outside
society.
it
has
served,
and
has
been
determined
to
serve,
worthwhile
rehabilitative
goals
within
the
department
of
correction.
but
we
have
opened
the
door
and
the
three-judge
court
says
the
fourteenth
amendment
now
denies
us
the
opportunity
to
pick
and
choose
among
those
organizations
that
can
come
in.
we
have
sponsored
and
worked
with
the
alcoholics
anonymous,
obviously
an
organization
with
outside
organizations
which
serves
valid
rehabilitative
purposes.
at
our
youth
facility,
we
have
the
boy
scouts,
once
again
an
organization
that
serves
valid
rehabilitative
purposes
and
has
good,
solid
roots
in
society.
but
because
we
have
brought
in
the
aa,
because
we
have
brought
in
the
jaycees
and
the
boy
scouts,
now
the
three-judge
court
says
we
can
no
longer
pick
and
choose
among
those
organizations
which
utilize
our
resources,
which
utilize
our
time,
and
we
must
treat
them
all
alike.
if
we
let
someone
come
in
from
aa
or
the
boy
scouts
from
the
outside,
from
free
society,
or
the
jaycees,
we
must
let
someone
come
in
from
the
prisoners’
labor
union.
if
we
permit
the
jaycees
to
send
in
bundles
of
publications
for
distribution
to
their
members,
we
must
permit
the
prisoners’
labor
union
to
send
in
the
bundles.
i
would
submit
that
the
three-judge
court
has
not
properly
read
the
decision
of
this
court
in
ross
v.
moffitt.
there
are
obviously
limits
beyond
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
cannot
be
stretched
without
breaking,
and
in
this
case
i
submit
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
broken
asunder.
furthermore,
this
court
announced
quite
clearly
in
pell
v.
procunier,
the
basis
under
which
correctional
officials
can
pick
and
choose
among
various
goals,
and
recognize
the
valid
fears
of
correctional
officials.
in
this
case,
among
those
fears
are
concerted
action,
because
even
if
the
intent
of
this
union
is
peaceable,
i
submit
that
common
sense
leads
us
to
a
conclusion
that
if
their
peaceable
demands
are
not
met,
that
inmates,
prisoners
who
have
already
demonstrated
an
inability
to
live
within
the
law,
and
quite
often
resort
to
violence
as
a
means
of
determining
their
own
ends,
will
of
necessity
resort
to
violence.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
you
honor,
must
the
department
of
correction
await
a
catastrophic
incident?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
must
we
await
a
catastrophic
incident
before
there
is
a
factual
record
which
will
support
the
fears
and
concerns
of
correctional
officials?
must
men
be
killed
and
injured,
must
property
be
burned
before
our
fears
have
any
validity?
must
inmates
be
given
the
opportunity
to
use
our
facilities,
our
limited
resources?
must
they
be
allowed
to
coalesce
into
formal
organizations,
which
if
they
said,
we
are
going
to
strike
tomorrow
and
we
have
77
units
in
north
carolina,
there
will
be
no
way
of
the
state
to
respond?
we
saw
a
horrible
riot
occur
in
1968,
when
the
so-called
bulls
of
the
yard
had
a
very
profitable
hobby
shop
business
going,
where
some
of
them
were
making
so
much
money
that
the
internal
revenue
service
brought
suit
for
failure
to
pay
taxes.
and
when
our..
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
sir
and
when
that
occurred.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
sir,
when
a
new
administration
came
into
being,
and
that
administration
sought
to
emasculate
the
power
of
some
of
these
inmate
bulls.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
the
first
instance?
your
honor,
please,
i
do
not
really
believe
cooperation
is
needed.
the
inmate
peer
structure
is
such
that
cooperation
of
the
officials
is
not
required.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
at
some
point
officials
do
know
about
it,
and
in
our
situation.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
when
they
finally,
when
the
new
administration
came
into
being,
an
attempt
was
made
to
withdraw
the
power.
riots
occurred,
now,
we
are
quite
familiar
with
the
riots
which
occurred
at
walpole
as
a
result
of
the
introduction
there
of
the
national
prisoners
reform
association.
there
is
a
book
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
constant
fear,
in
which
an
inmate
tells
how
it
was
the
introduction
of
the
national
prisoners
reform
association
which
was
the
catalyst
for
the
violence
that
occurred
as
the
hardened,
long-term
inmates
sought
to
take
control
of
the
institution.
the
deposition
of
warden
mullen
of
rhode
island
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the
deposition
of
warden
mullen
is
a
horror
story
of
what
can
happen
in
an
institution.
when
he
arrived
there
was
not
a
window
left
in
that
entire
institution.
the
national
guard
and
the
state
police
were
called
out
and
for
five
to
six
months
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
run
that
institution
to
restore
law
and
order.
and
as
warden
mullen
tells,
when
you
have
various
diverse
groups
within
an
institution,
and
in
that
case
a
youth
commission
trying
to
break
away
from
the
leadership
of
the
reform
association,
the
older
hard-core
mafia
types.
all
of
a
sudden
the
members
of
the
youth
commission,
disbelieving
how
hard
and
violent
the
older
inmates
could
be,
in
one
instance
were
almost
wiped
out.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
affidavits
of
the
officials
--
i
am
just
illustrating,
your
honor
--
the
deposition
of
warden
mullen
is
a
part
of
this
record.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
describes
that
as
a
danger.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
time
is
running
quickly
and...
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
is
a
very.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
we
took
a
moderate
position.
now...
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
we
have
objected.
the
reason
we
are
before
this
court,
the
reason
we
are
in
the
district
court
is
because
the
regulations
were
promulgated,
which
prohibited
the
formation
and
operation
of
a
prisoners’
labor
union
within
the
walls
of
the
north
carolina
department
of
correction.
the
one
concession,
which
was
a
moderate
point,
because
we
were
concerned
about
first
amendment
rights,
is
that
the
north
carolina
prisoners’
labor
union
under
the
auspices
of
one
robby
perner,
had
an
office
in
the
city
of
durham,
and
we
did
not
say
inmates
could
not
join
the
prisoners’
labor
union,
we
have
no
regulation
saying
you
cannot
be
a
member
of
the
prisoners’
labor
union,
or
you
cannot
be
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan,
or
you
cannot
be
a
member
of
the
black
panthers.
we
had
no
objection
to
inmates
on
a
one-to-one
situation
writing
to
mr.
perner
at
his
outside
office,
and
being
members
of
this
outside
organization,
we
objected
to
the
formation,
creation,
and
implementation
of
concerted
action
within
the
facilities
of
the
department
of
correction,
the
utilization
of
state
resources,
and
time
and
facilities
and
manpower.
because
we
have
not
said
that
inmates
could...
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
district
court’s
ultimate
conclusion
is
we
must
let
them
in
or
else
stop
all
other
organizations.
to
control
this
group
we
would
have
to
throw
out
jaycees,
aa,
boy
scouts,
any
other
organization
which
the
department
of
correction
has
determined
serves
a
beneficial,
rehabilitative,
and
penological
need.
now,
we
have
not
tried
to
interfere
with
the
outside
organization.
our
interference,
your
honor,
is
with
a
concerted
organization
within
the
department
of
correction.
if
they
want
to
join
any
outside
organization,
if
they
are
to
receive
literature
from
that
outside
organization,
we
will
not
interfere.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
it
means
we
must
leave
a
man,
it
means
we
have
no
decision.
the
court
has
emasculated
the
authority
of
the
north
carolina
department
of
correction
to
pick
and
choose
among
those
organizations
which
will
come
in,
those
organizations
which
will
utilize
our
resources.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor,
we
have
no
power
to
choose.
your
honor,
please,
it
is
mr.
geller’s
turn
now
for
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor,
just
a
bit.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
our
memorandum
in
the
district
court,
this
is
what
we
have
said.
page
2
of
the
memorandum,
it
is
in
the
record,
apparently
the
plaintiff,
that
is
the
labor
union,
is
not
seeking
to
establish
a
national
labor
relations
or
type
of
labor
union
in
the
prison
system.
that
was
our
statement.
we
went
on
to
say
more
accurately,
what
they
want
to
form
is
an
organized
group
of
elected
representatives
of
inmates
within
the
prison
to
meet
together
and
to
take
their
proposals,
criticisms,
suggestions,
and
the
like
to
the
administration.
now,
that
is
what
we
have
said
in
there.
number
two,
we
never
have
--
let
me
phrase
it
this
way.
our
situation
vis-à-vis
the
union,
with
its
office
located
in
durham
is
that
inmates,
and
we
took
that
moderate
position,
could
join
this
outside
organization,
and
that
is
what
i
want
to
emphasize.
we
never
denied
their
right
to
join
this
outside
organization
as
we
have
never
denied
the
right
for
the
inmates
to
join
any
organization
of
their
choice,
we
could
not
do
it,
we
could
not
perform
lobotomies
on
them.
now,
these
are
copies
of
various
newsletters
which
they
published;
one
of
which
is
attached
to
the
complaint
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
that
tells
how
an
organizer
came
from
california
to
attempt
to
organize
the
north
carolina
department
of
correction.
i
submit
this
is
part
of
a
national
group.
every
one
of
their
newsletters
contains
the
same
authorization
for
representation
for
collective
bargaining.
the
one
that
is
in
the
record
contains
that,
the
ones
which
were
published
subsequently
contain
that.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
that
is
the
only.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
cannot
answer
that,
your
honor,
i
really
do
not
know.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
the
design
of
our
response
in
this
case
is
based
on
packett
v.
manson,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
for
connecticut.
that
was
our
basis
for
response,
and
we
followed
the
packer
holding
almost
verbatim.
i
would
submit
that
packett
is
an
excellent
discussion
of
the
applicable
law
in
this
case,
it
is
well
thought
out.
now,
the
three-judge
court
never
even
mentions
packett,
just
disregards
packett,
as
if
the
decision
does
not
exist.
now,
as
far
as
alternatives,
under
pell
v.
procunier,
in
north
carolina
these
prisoners
are
not
held
in
outer
darkness,
number
one,
they
may
write
to
anyone,
and
they
write
to
the
press
and
their
letters
appear
in
letters
to
the
editor.
they
may
write
to
anyone,
they
may
be
visited
by
the
press,
unlike
pell
v.
procunier.
the
press
can
come
in
and
interview
specific
inmates.
we
have
an
organized
inmate
grievance
commission
which
was
funded
this
year
$125,000,
it
exists.
according
to
their
records,
last
year
they
handled
4,755
complaints
from
the
inmates,
so
the
inmates
have
full
correspondence.
last
saturday,
the
secretary
of
corrections
spoke
before
the
north
carolina
civil
liberties
union
at
the
annual
convention.
there
are
alternatives.
that
was
the
situation
pell
spoke
to.
they
are
not
held
in
outer
darkness.
now,
i
would
submit
further,
under
pell,
the
big
man
theory
is
applicable.
the
organizers
of
this
union,
the
inmates
in
this
system,
as
revealed
in
footnote
no.
16,
are
inmates
who
have
had
a
history
of
violence
in
this
system.
two
are
murderers,
the
third
is
a
con
man
who
has
even
refused
his
own
identity,
and
we
had
to
prove
in
federal
court
that
he...
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor,
but
the
aa
unit
has
outside
representatives,
members
of
society
who
have
proven
their
worth
in
the
outside
community
and
have
come
in
to
lend
their
assistance
to
helping
the
inmates
become
rehabilitated
and
returned
to
society.
that
is
the
difference
here.
these
outside
individuals
are
out
to
serve
a
social
good.
now,
the
newsletters,
as
i
showed
the
court
copies,
are
published
in
durham
at
that
office.
the
organization,
if
it
exists,
does
not
exist
within
the
prison
system
today.
they
have
never
satisfied
our
regulations
and
the
federal
court
has
found
that
they
have
not
properly
attempted
to.
now,
if
they
say
it
exists
and
newsletters
have
been
printed,
yes,
in
durham,
and
they
have
come
in
and
as
i
have
said
previously,
and
as
their
newsletter
number
1,
attached
to
the
complaint
illustrates,
it
is
part
an
attempt
of
a
national
organization.
aand
i
would
submit,
and
all
the
cases
show,
that
there
has
in
fact
been
an
attempt
nationally
for
these
inmates
to
organize
together.
