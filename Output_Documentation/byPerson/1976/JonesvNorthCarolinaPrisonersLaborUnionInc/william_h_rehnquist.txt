justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
second
of
these
two
cases,
number
75-1874,
jones
versus
north
carolina
prisoners'
union,
the
appellants
who
are
north
carolina
correctional
officials
promulgated
regulations
which
barred
meetings
inside
the
prison
of
the
various
north
carolina
institutions
of
such
as
those
of
appellee
which
is
the
north
carolina
prisoners
union,
inc.,
in
which
prohibited
inmates
from
soliciting
other
inmates
to
join
the
union.
appellants
also
refused
to
deliver
bulk
mail
packages
of
union
publications
which
had
been
mailed
to
inmates
for
redistribution
to
other
inmates.
the
union
filed
this
action
challenging
these
regulations
in
the
united
states
district
of
the
--
in
north
carolina.
if
claimed
that
efforts
to
prevent
the
operation
of
the
prisoners'
union
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
it
and
its
members,
and
the
fact
that
the
jaycees
and
alcoholics
anonymous
were
granted
rights
denied
to
it,
deprived
it
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
a
three-judge
district
court
in
north
carolina
substantially
agreed
with
the
--
these
contentions
in
order
that
the
prisoners'
union
be
given
meeting
and
other
rights
accorded
to
other
inmate
organizations.
for
the
reason
set
forth
and
an
opinion
which
have
been
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
we
reversed
the
judgement
of
the
three-judge
district
court.
we
concluded
that
the
district
court
did
not
give
sufficient
deference
to
the
decisions
of
the
prison
administrators
and
to
the
peculiar
and
restrictive
circumstances
of
penal
confinement.
the
prison
officials
viewed
the
operation
of
a
functioning
prison
union
to
be
potentially
dangerous
and
they
have
not
been
shown
to
be
wrong
in
these
apprehensions.
we
do
not
view
the
speech,
union's
speech
and
associational
claims
or
its
equal
protection
claim
as
justifying
a
different
result.
these
rights
must
give
way
to
the
reasonable
considerations
of
penal
management
among
which
internal
security
considerations
necessarily
loom
large.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr
justice
brennan
has
joined.
