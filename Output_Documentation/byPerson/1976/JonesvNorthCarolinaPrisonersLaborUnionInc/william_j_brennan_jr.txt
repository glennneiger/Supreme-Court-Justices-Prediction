justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
said,
what
is
the
significance
of
paragraph
1
in
page
32;
whatever
right
of
association
of
any
prisoners
derived
from
the
first
amendment,
they
have
no
right
to
form
or
belong
to
a
labor
union
for
the
purpose
of
taking
concerted
actions
to
force
their
demands
upon
prison
administrators.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
have
been
saying
the
demand
here
is
that
they
want
in
a
concerted
fashion
to
assert
certain
rights
as
a
prison
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesnâ€™t
this
say
they
do
not
have
those
rights?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
it
says
--
i
thought
it
said
whatever
right
they
may
have,
if
any,
they
have
no
right
to
form
or
belong
to
a
labor
union
for
the
purpose
of
taking
concerted
action.
