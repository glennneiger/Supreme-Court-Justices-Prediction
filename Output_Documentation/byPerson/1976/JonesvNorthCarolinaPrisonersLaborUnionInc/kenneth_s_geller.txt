mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
safron
has
indicated,
the
district
court
in
this
case
has
held
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
required
by
the
first
amendment
to
allow
inmates
in
its
penal
institutions
to
solicit
other
inmates,
orally
or
in
writing,
for
the
purpose
of
encouraging
membership
in
the
north
carolina
prisoners’
labor
union.
it
has
also
permitted
to
inmates
to
receive
outside
correspondence
and
publications
advocating
prison
unionism.
in
addition,
the
court
below
has
ruled
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
the
state
to
accord
the
prisoners’
union
mass
mailing
and
meeting
privileges
within
its
correctional
institutions
to
the
same
extent
that
any
other
inmate
organization
enjoys
such
operating
privileges.
the
united
states
believes
that
this
decision
is
incorrect,
and
that
the
district
court
has
intruded
itself
into
an
area
that
should
properly
be
left
to
the
sound
discretion
of
correctional
officials.
we
believe
in
addition
that
if
the
lower
court’s
decision
is
upheld,
it
may
lead
to
serious
breaches
of
prison
security
and
may
impair
efforts
of
inmate
rehabilitation
as
well.
now,
legal
principles
that
govern
this
case
are
clear.
without
question,
the
anti-union
regulations
of
the
north
carolina
bureau
of
corrections,
like
those
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons,
restrict
to
some
extent
the
associational
liberties
of
prison
inmates.
but
this
court
has
emphasized
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
first
amendment
rights
are
not
absolute,
and
that
such
rights
must
be
considered
in
light
of
the
special
characteristics
of
the
environment
in
which
they
are
asserted.
in
a
prison
environment
the
controlling
standard
was
articulated
three
years
ago
in
pell
v.
procunier.
there
and
upholding
state
and
federal
regulations
that
erected
a
blanket
prohibition
against
face-to-face
interviews
of
prison
inmates
by
representatives
of
the
news
media.
the
court
stated
that
a
prison
inmate
only
retains
those
first
amendment
rights
that
are
not
inconsistent
with
his
status
as
a
prisoner,
or
with
the
legitimate
penological
considerations
of
the
correction
system.
challenges
the
prison
restrictions
that
are
asserted
to
inhibit
first
amendment
rights,
said
the
court,
must
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
the
legitimate
policies
and
goals
of
the
correction
system.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
for
the
first
part
of
the
opinion,
mr.
justice
stevens,
was
the
first
amendment
considerations.
the
second
part
of
the
opinion,
the
district
court
found
that
the
state
must
allow
the
north
carolina
prisoners’
labor
union
to
engage
in
meetings
within
the
prison,
in
mass
mailings,
and
in
allowing
outsiders
to
come
into
the
prison
to
the
same
extent
that
it
allows
any
other
inmate
organization
to
enjoy
those
facilities.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
believe
that
it
did,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
think
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
district
court
did
not
extend
the
first
amendment
principles.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
fourteenth
amendment,
that
is
correct,
but
i
assume
mr.
justice
stevens
was
talking
about
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
we
do,
certainly
--
but
this
court,
as
we
read
the
opinion,
did
not
extend
the
first
amendment
discussion
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
it
incorporates
the
first,
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
prisoners
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
receive
mass
mailings
or
to
allow
outsiders
to
come
in
to
talk
to
them.
but
it
held
that
they
had
that
right
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
same
extent
as
any
other
inmate
organization
within
north
carolina’s
prisons
is
allowed
to
enjoy
those
rights.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
now,
we
have
discussed
in
some
length
in
our
brief
the
serious
problems
that
may
reasonably
be
anticipated
in
the
area
of
prisoner
rehabilitation
if
inmate
unions
are
allowed
to
function
within
the
prison
system.
we
have
pointed
out,
and
i
believe
it
is
not
disputed,
that
efforts
to
change
the
value
system
of
individual
prisoners
or
to
achieve
inroads
in
the
prison
social
structure
would
be
severely
frustrated
if
correctional
officials
had
to
deal
with,
or
at
least
answer
to
an
inmate
group
with
pervasive
influence
throughout
the
prison.
but
i
would
like
to
limit
my
discussion
here
to
the
potential
impact
of
such
prisoner
groups
upon
an
even
more
important
correctional
goal;
one
that
this
court
in
pell
termed
central
to
all
other
institutional
considerations.
that
is
the
internal
security
of
the
prison
facilities
themselves.
it
cannot
be
emphasized
too
strongly
that
this
case
involves
a
claim
by
prison
inmates,
that
they
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
associate
with
other
inmates,
and
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
within
the
confines
of
the
prison.
prisons
are
unlike
any
other
institution
in
our
society.
they
are
closed
communities
of
proven
lawbreakers
under
the
constant
and
close
supervision
of
a
limited
staff.
for
obvious
reasons,
related
both
to
the
type
of
people
who
constitute
the
inmate
population,
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
inevitably
must
live.
the
atmosphere
in
prisons
is
frequently
tense
and
volatile,
having
no
counterpart
in
the
outside
world.
in
these
circumstances
we
believe,
the
presence
of
any
concerted
activity
among
inmates
is
a
cause
for
concern.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
means,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
the
district
court
acknowledged
that
if
at
some
future
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
states
that
if
any
time
in
the
future
they
begin
to
act
as
a
group
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
acts
that
the
state
may
legitimately
prohibit,
the
state
at
that
point
may
move
in.
but
we
believe
as
does
the
state..
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
under
the
district
court’s
opinion,
these
collection
of
inmates
would
be
allowed
to
engage
in
the
first
steps
that
we
believe
would
lead
inevitably
to
concerted
activity,
there
would
be
no...
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that
of
course
mr.
chief
justice
relates
to
the
equal
protection
analysis
of
the
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
the
opinion.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
incorporated
in
the
judgment
which
follows
in
appendix
b,
that
is
correct.
i
think
under
the
district
court’s
opinion,
these
inmates
have
to
be
allowed
to
solicit
other
inmates.
they
have
to
be
allowed
to
organize
and
coalesce
into
a
group,
and
they
have
to
be
allowed
to
engage
in
such
concerted
activities
as
other
inmate
groups
within
the
union,
no
matter
how
beneficial
the
other
inmate
groups’
purposes
are,
are
allowed
to
enjoy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
the
equal
protection
analysis.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
district
court
has
held
that
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct,
and
we
disagree
with
that.
we
think
that
there
are
obviously
differences
among
inmate
groups.
some
have
obvious
beneficial
purposes.
inmate
leaders
do
not
attempt
to
speak
for
other
inmates
in
certain
groups
such
as
alcoholics
anonymous.
in
fact,
the
overwhelming
weight
of
authority
among
correctional
officials
is
that
inmate
groups
should
not
be
allowed
to
function,
but
that
these
other
groups
with
obvious
beneficial
value
should
be
allowed
to
function.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
legitimate
reasons
we
believe
for
this
concern
on
the
part
of
correctional
officials.
one
is
that
inmates,
like
people
generally,
tend
to
behave
with
greater
emotion
and
fewer
inhibitions
when
acting
as
part
of
a
group.
moreover,
unlike
the
general
population,
prisoners
have
the
shared
characteristic,
as
mr.
safron
indicated,
of
having
on
one
or
more
occasions
resorted
to
seriously
illegal
means
to
achieve
their
goals.
a
union
with
a
formal
leadership
and
organizational
structure
would
always
have
the
potential
of
engineering
institution-wide
or
even
system-wide
outbreaks.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
they
could.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
do
not
think
it
is
important
what
they
call
their
group.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
the
warden
would
allow
it,
they
would
have
to
submit
a
charter
to
the
warden
explaining
what
the
goals
of
the
organization
are,
it
does
not
really
matter
what
they
call
themselves.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct,
it
would
be
monitored.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
obviously,
the
prison
authorities
would
move
in
at
that
point.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
because
if
it
is
called
alcoholics
anonymous.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
if
it
is
called
alcoholics.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
it
calls
itself
a
union.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
does
not
matter,
we
believe,
what
it
calls
itself.
it
depends
what
its
announced
goals
are.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
banned
because
it
is
an...
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
because
its
announced
goals
are
inimical
to
the
rehabilitation
of
inmates
and
to
the
valid
correctional
goals
of
institutional
security.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
as
i
have
explained,
we
think
that
an
organized
group
of
inmates
has
the
inherent
potential.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
it
is
not
the
organizing,
it
is
the
fact
that
they
have
coalesced
together
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
grievances.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
it
is
what
the
impact
is
of
what
they
plan
to
do.
alcoholics
anonymous...
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
plan
to
present
grievances,
as
we
understand
it,
although
there
has
been
some
fluctuation,
they
plan
to
present
grievances
to
prison
officials
about
conditions.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
on
an
individualized
basis
it
is
not
wrong
and
it
certainly
has
to
be
encouraged.
what
the
state
legitimately
fears
is
that
when
they
band
together
for
this
purpose,
they
will
always
have
the
express
or
the
implied
power
to
use
force
if
they
do
not
gain
what
they
believe
is
their
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
obviously,
there
is
a
limit
to
the
pervasive.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
question
is
we
believe
what
legitimate
steps
the
prison
officials
are
allowed
to
take
at
the
outset,
when
the
organization
has
announced
what
its
goals
are,
must
it
wait,
as
mr.
safron
has
said,
until
these
evils
actually
come
to
pass
before
it
may
take
the
first
steps?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
do
not
think
i
can
agree,
mr.
justice
stevens.
first
of
all,
this
union
has
never
operated
within
the
prison
system
in
north
carolina.
so
although
their
announced
goals
seem
laudable,
i
think
that
as
this
court
acknowledged
in
procunier
v.
martinez,
the
courts
must
defer
to
the
reasonably
anticipated
goals
of
the
correctional
officials
as
they
perceive
the
inmate
organization
to
operate
in
the
future.
but
secondly,
i
think
we
also
have
to
take
into
account
that
once
this
union
becomes
a
fixture
in
the
prison
system,
it
will
not
be
operated
by
these
responsible
outside
advocates
of
prison
reform,
it
will
be
operated
by
the
prisoners
themselves.
now,
all
these
goals..
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
the
appellees
do
not
deny
that
these
unions
will
be
operated
from
within
the
prison.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
certain
that
the
district
court..
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
think
that
the
findings
do
indicate
the
fact
that
this
union
is
made
up
primarily
of
prison
inmates,
and
that
it
is
governed
by
democratic
principles,
and
therefore,
i
would
assume
that
the
majority
vote
would
be
made
up
of
prisoners
rather
than
outsiders.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
district
court
did,
but
we
think
that
the
district
court
did
not
defer
substantially
to
the
expert
judgment
of
correctional
officials
who
should
be
able
to
look
at
these
goals.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
we
think
that
the
district
court’s
findings
are
in
clear
violation
of
what
this
court
said
in
pell
v.
procunier.
pell
v.
procunier
and
in
procunier
v.
martinez,
the
court
said
that
unless
the
fears
of
correctional
officials
are
grossly
exaggerated
on
the
record,
the
court
must
defer
to
them.
now,
we
do
not
think
that
the
court
did
that
here,
we
think
that
the
court
substituted
its
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
question
of
findings
and
fact,
we
think
it
is
a
question
of
what
legal
standard
the
district
court
should
bring
to
bear
on
the
facts
in
the
particular
case,
and
we
think
that
in
this
case
it
gave
absolutely
no
deference
to
the
legitimate
findings
and
anticipated
fears
of
the
correctional
officials.
and
after
all
it
is
the
correctional
officials
who
have
to
deal
with
any
outbreaks
if
they
should
occur.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
aspects
of
the
court’s
mandate,
but
the
court
also
said,
and
it
is
the
first
paragraph
on
page
32,
that
all
inmates
in
the
north
carolina
prison
system
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
solicit
and
invite
other
inmates
to
join
the
union.
that
is
not
dependent
upon
what
other
outside
organizations
are
allowed
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
am
not...
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
district
court
explicitly
stated
that
it
did
not
have
to
reach
that
question
because
of
what
it
perceived
to
be
certain
concessions
by
the
state,
but
the
state
today,
and
we
believe
they
are
correct,
disagrees
with
those
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
not
correct,
as
we
understand
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
believe
it
is
wrong.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
north
carolina,
we
think,
is
taking
a
very
sensible
position.
it
realizes
there
are
some
first
amendment
interests
on
the
part
of
prison
inmates,
so
what
it
allows
them
to
do
is
to
do
engage
in
outside
correspondence
with
union
members,
to
receive
correspondence
from
the
union,
and
consider
themselves
union
members,
because
that
does
not
raise
any
problems
within
the
union.
it
is
only
when
they
start
to
operate
within
the
prison
by
talking
to
other
inmates,
attempting
to
organize
other
inmates,
that
the
state
wants
to
step
in,
it
has
no
desire
to
limit
discussions
it
has
with
outsiders
about
union
activity.
