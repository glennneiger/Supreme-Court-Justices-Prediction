mr.
norman
b.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
represent
the
appellee
prisoners’
union
here.
the
union
is
a
prison
reform
and
mutual
self-help
organization,
it
is
not
a
labor
union
in
the
ordinary
sense.
the
union
does
not
claim
and
has
not
claimed
any
right
to
bargain,
strike,
or
take
any
concerted,
disruptive
action.
the
union’s
objectives
are
to
improve
prison
rehabilitation
programs,
to
establish
community-based
facilities,
such
as
halfway
houses,
to
secure
public
support
for
reform
legislation
and
administrative
measures,
to
litigate
prison
rights
issues,
to
act
by
democratic
processes
in
a
multiracial
organization.
the
union,
contrary
to
the
solicitor
general’s
statements,
has
existed
and
has
had
activities.
there
is
a
period
of
six
months
in
existence
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
regulation
in
question,
and
another
12
months
of
existence
subsequent
to
the
district
court’s
decision.
in
contrary
to
what
mr.
safron
says,
the
union
still
exists,
indeed,
these
letters
were
published
within
the
last
couple
of
months.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
is
part
of
the
record,
your
honor,
please.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
the
north
carolina
incorporation
laws
allow
incorporators
to
say
essentially
anything
they
want
to
in
their
papers,
and
there
is
no
effort
to
review
them
and
pass
upon
their
adequacy.
but
to
respond
directly
to
your
honor’s
question
in
article
pre
of
the
charter,
the
union
does
purport
to
say.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
is
not
in
the
printed
appendix,
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
simply
a
part
of
the
record
that
came
up
from
the
district
court.
i
have
an
extra
copy
and
i
would
be
happy
to
leave
it
with
the
court,
but
to
respond
to
the
question,
it
does
purport
to
claim
a
desire
to
act
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
does
not
claim
any
right
to
take
concerted
action
that
would
be
disruptive
of
the
prisons,
such
as...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
if
your
honor
please,
look
at
the
unionized
employees
of
the
federal
government,
they
have
no
right
to
strike
or
take
illegal
concerted
action
yet
virtually
every
agency
is
unionized.
i
think
you
can
have
all
different
varieties
of
unions.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
union
realizes
that,
that
purpose
is
illegal
under
north
carolina
law,
and...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
your
honor.
one
of
the
announced
purposes
of
the
union
is
to
secure
favorable
legislation.
in
one
reform,
one
legislative
reform
the
union
would
desire,
would
be
to
allow
prisoners
to
collectively
bargain
in
north
carolina.
i
must
say
not
a
very
hopeful
and
not
a
very
probable
purpose,
but
nonetheless,
that
would
be
the
way
they
would
go
about
it.
they
realize
currently
that
even
state
employees
are
precluded
from
collective
bargaining
in
north
carolina.
so
the
purpose
would
await
legislative
reform,
if
ever.
but
there
is
no
intent
to
proceed
unlawfully
and
to
violate
the
state’s
laws
in
that
regard,
nor
can
it
be
gleaned
from
any
of
the
papers
in
the
records,
or
from
any
of
the
evidence
offered
in
court.
the
union’s
activities
in
the
first
six
months
before
the
ban
came
into
effect
included
the
publication
of
newsletters,
the
recruitment
of
2,200
members;
roughly
one
out
of
every
six
or
seven
inmates
in
the
north
carolina
department
of
correction
became
a
member.
some
modest
alterations
of
correctional
procedure
were
claimed
by
the
union;
getting
hot
showers
at
one
unit,
additional
clothing
and
new
linen
in
another.
the
record
indicates,
without
any
rebutting
evidence,
that
the
union
defused
certain
racial
incidents
at
central
prison
and
brought
about
a
degree
of
racial
harmony
there.
that
the
personal
responsibility
of
the
members
was
enhanced
through
the
democratic
processes
of
the
union,
and
that
the
union
helped
to
build
self-reliance
among
its
members.
now,
since
the
district
court
judgment
on
may
12th,
1976,
another
12
months
of
existence,
i
do
not
feel
at
liberty
to
depart
from
the
record
and
discuss
what
has
happened,
except
to
say
that
the
union
does
exist,
and
it
does
publish
newsletters,
contrary
to
mr.
safron’s
assertions.
there
is
in
the
record
the
regulation
that
the
department
of
correction
adopted,
pursuant
to
the
district
court’s
opinion.
the
regulation
applies
neutrally
to
all
organizations
of
inmates
within
the
prisons.
it
imposes
what
we
concede
are
legitimate
and
constitutional
time,
place,
and
manner
of
restrictions,
such
as
a
maximum
of
25
people
attending
meetings
and
holding
meetings
only
if
adequate
supervision
is
available.
the
regulation
of
march
26th,
1975,
at
issue
here,
on
its
face
prohibits
solicitation
of
membership,
denies
the
use
of
departmental
property
to
the
union,
and
excludes
outside
organizers.
in
addition,
as
applied
from
the
record
we
learned
that
the
regulation
banned
the
bulk
mailing
of
newsletters
by
the
union.
also,
the
regulation
banned
the
circulation
of
any
written
material
that
could
be
deemed
a
channel
for
solicitation,
so
that
we
must
regard
any
discussion
of
benefits,
purposes,
or
even
existence
of
the
union
as
being
subject
to
that
ban.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
is
correct,
i
am
referring
to
the
march
26th,
1975
regulations
which
are
in
issue.
many
individual
newsletters
and
items
of
correspondence
were
interdicted
and
sent
back
to
their
senders
or
destroyed,
including
correspondence
from
persons
outside
the
correction
department,
in
direct
defiance
with
the
standards
in...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
your
honor
please,
i
feel
that,
that
has
an
element
of
misrepresentation
to
it,
because
they
are
not
capable
under
our
laws,
of
acting.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
should
think
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
department
of
correction
to
say
no,
you
may
solicit
memberships,
but
please
do
not
represent
that
you
are
a
collective
bargaining
agent,
because
you
are
not.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
union
did
that
and
they…
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it
did
that
in
its
newspaper
once
or
twice.
but
in
any
event
the
state’s
response
to
that
was
too
broad.
the
state
went
too
far.
the
state
did
not
say
do
not
misrepresent,
the
state
said
do
not
solicit
in
any
form
or
manner
and
we
submit,
as
the
district
court
properly
decided,
that
this
was
an
overbroad
stifling
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
it
would
be
in
defiance
of
the
first
amendment
to
prohibit
solicitation
by
the
prisoners
to
join
the
union.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
regulations,
if
your
honor
please,
did
not
say
that
outsiders
could
not
solicit.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
that
was
done
because...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
it
said
that
outside
organizers.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
is
true.
theoretically,
outside
organizers
can
solicit
by
mail,
but
in
practice,
and
as
the
record
shows,
many,
many
pieces
of
mail
coming
from
outside
organizers
were
interdicted
and
sent
back.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
do
not
think
the
response
is
interdiction,
your
honor,
i
think
the
response
is
a
statement
to
the
union
saying...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
think
this
court
did
the
right
thing
in
procunier
v.
martinez,
it
says
you
give
notice
and
you
give
an
opportunity
to
object
and
you
have
a
neutral
decision
maker
and
hopefully
some
reasons...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
you
withhold
it
and
give
notice
to
the
prisoner.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
i
am
going
to
write
to
the
free
world
correspondent
and
say
the
basis...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
and
i
am
going
to
do
it
pursuant
to
proper
procedures.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
would,
and
i
would
know
that...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
the
record
says
it
was
not,
the
record
says
it
just
either
disappeared
or
was
sent
back,
returned
to
sender,
addressee,
and
all
sorts
of
illogical.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
record
shows
that
it
was
opened.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
the
people
who
wrote
the
letters
filed
affidavits
with
the
district
court,
attaching
copies
of
the
letters,
saying
what
was
in
it
and
what
happened
to
the
letters.
there
was
no
effort
by
the
department
of
correction
to
follow
the
martinez
procedural
requirements
and
as
i
say,
the
response
of
the
department
of
correction
was
excessive.
they
outlawed
all
solicitation
instead
of
solicitation
that
might
have
been...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
oh
no,
i
think
we
would
insist
or
would
wish
to
insist
upon
prisoners
having
the
right
to
solicit
other
prisoners
to
join
the
organization.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
your
honor,
no,
we
think
that
the
first
amendment,
the
right
of
association
goes
broader
than
that.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
this
gets
into
the
equal
protection
analysis,
and
we
feel
that
we
should
be
permitted
to
have
outside
organizers,
only
to
the
same
extent
that
other
organizations
similarly
situated,
with
similar
goals
and
similar
characteristics,
are
permitted
to
do.
with
regard
to...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir,
and
when
challenged
under
the
constitution,
we
think
they
have
to
support
them
with
valid
reasons
and
some
evidence.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
think
there
are
some
freedom
of
association
principles
involved
here
that
could
not
be
easily
resolved
by
simply
excluding
everybody.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
your
honor
please,
as
i
understand
the
district
court’s
opinion,
the
solicitation
of
members
was
grounded
upon
right
of
association
principles,
drafted...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
by
prisoners,
to
prisoners.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
by
prisoners
to
prisoners.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
under
the
district
court’s
opinion
the
things
which
were
grounded
on
the
equal
protection
clause
were
meetings,
mass
mailing
of
literature
and
having
outside
people
come
in.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
paragraph
1,
if
your
honor
please,
the
first
clause
of
that
at
any
rate
is
a
first
amendment
right
of
association
of
judgment.
i
think
the
second
clause
of
paragraph
1
and
paragraphs
2
and
3
are
grounded
upon
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
is
not
very
well
written
and
i
think
if
i
may
amend.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
if
i
could
amend
my
response
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
i
think
i
would
say,
i
would
excise
the
words,
“and
all
other
persons”,
and
would
simply
use
the
words
“inmates
shall
be
permitted
to
solicit
and
invite”.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
then
i
would
add
a
footnote
in
saying
other
persons
could
do
so
only
by
correspondence.
in
other
words,
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
compel
correctional
departments
to
allow
outsiders
in
unless
there
is
some
equal
protection
leverage
present.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
i
would
be
in
trouble.
i
do
not
think
i
could
say
that
the
first
amendment
encompasses
a
bulk
mailing
privilege.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
i
would
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
there
too,
your
honor,
yes
sir,
because
i
do
not
think...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
i
think
the
state
has
found...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
district
court.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
we
feel
that
the
experience
has
been
so
good
from
the
jaycees
and
the
alcoholics
anonymous,
and
other
groups,
that
the
state
is
learning
to
handle
associational
interest
in
the
correctional
setting.
we
feel
that
it
will
suffer
no
more
from
what
our
union
proposes
to
do
than
it
has
from
what
these
other
organizations
have
done.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it
would
depend
on
what
kind
of
aims
and
purposes
and
what
kind
of
proposed
activities.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
have,
your
honor,
and
it
certainly
does
not.
many
of
the
things
it
includes
would
be
incompatible
i
think
with...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
the
state
has
already
answered
that
question
by
saying
that
in
these
new
regulations,
these
provisional
regulations,
assuming
that
the
lower
court...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
right,
i
think
the
state
has
already
dealt
with
it.
they
have
said
submit
us
your
constitution
and
bylaws,
a
detailed
statement
of
your
proposed
operations
and
how
your
finances
are
going
to
be
handled.
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
come
in
unless
you
do
certain
things.
well,
right
now
the
union
is
in
the
process
of
trying
to
satisfy
the
department
under
these
regulations.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
sure,
but
i
am
saying
that
is
a
rational
way
to
go
about
deciding
what
organization
do
you
like
to
come
in.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
surely,
i
think
that
is
where
proposed
operations
come
in.
i
think
we
have
a
duty
even
in
prison
to
give
free
association
and
free
speech.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
right.
well,
your
honor,
that
is
a
hypothetical
that
--
i
am
not
prepared...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
they
could...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
ku
klux
klan
could
be
kept
out
unless
it
did
an
awfully
good
job
of
cleaning
up
its
aims
and
purposes,
because
its
purposes
are
to
foment
racial
hatred
and
perpetuate
racial
hatred.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
readily
perceived
from
reading
the
constitution,
as
i
recall.
these
things
do
stand
out,
but
moreover,
the
klan
has
had
years
of
operating
history
in
which
--
no
one
needs
to
recount
that,
everyone
knows
it,
but
the
north
carolina
prisoners’
labor
union
is
a
new
organization.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
there
is
a
national
prisoners
reform
association
which
is
active
in
some
states.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it
would
depend
on
an
examination
of
their
bylaws
and
constitution
and
the
statement
of
their
purposes.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
then
of
course
you
have
an
operating
history
of
violence,
and
you
do
not
have
as
far
as
the
union
is
concerned
here.
the
only
history
you
have
is
a
good
one;
it
shows
the
union
is
doing
a
lot
of
good
things
and
the
state
is
trying
to
suppress
it.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
feel
the
state
had
a
burden
to
come
in
with
some
facts
to
show
that
this
union
had
the
probability
of
doing
some
harm.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
unless
you
have
a
past
operating
history
or
a
statement
of
proposals,
which
in
itself
indicates
improper
conduct,
you
have
to
assume
that
the
people
will
not
improperly
conduct
themselves
and
of
course
the
district
court
made
this
point
and
it
is
a
very
important
one.
the
district
court
said
the
minute
things
seemed
to
be
going
awry,
the
correctional
authorities
can
come
in
and
stop
it,
and
litigate
later.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
maybe
so,
as
long
as
there
are
people
who...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
they
demanded
collective
bargaining?
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
because
collective
bargaining
would
be
unlawful
under
the
state
law
that
would
be
a
permissible
response.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
the
prison
officials
did
say
that,
if
your
honor
please,
whether
they
must
or
not,
they
conceded
that
in
their
brief
in
district
court.
that
was
the
opening
paragraph
in
their
brief
in
district
court.
they
said,
we
agree
that
this
is
not
a
labor
organization,
it
is
a
prison
reform
association.
so
they
agree
and
we
agree.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
if
your
honor
please,
that
was
all
worked
out
in
district
court
by
agreement.
the
district
court
understood
it,
the
parties
understood
it,
i
do
not
think
they
can
be
permitted
to
shift
their
positions
here.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
the
plaintiffs
made
a
representation
that
they
were
not
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
or
classical.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
no,
i
mean
that
those
facts
were
agreed
upon
by
the
court
and
the
defendant’s
brief
starts
out
with
those
paragraphs.
it
is
in
the
record
and
i
have
cited
it
in
my
brief.
so
that
is
a
red
herring,
i
think.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
that
the
alcoholics
anonymous
and
the
jaycees
both
are
quite
analogous
to
the
union.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor,
there
are
a
number,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
says
how
many.
the
same
is
true
of
the
aa.
the
other
organizations
are
much
less
in
scope.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
would
suspect
so.
i
think
there
is
a
jaycee
unit
in
every
prison
unit,
and
there
are
77
of
those.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
jaycees,
i
am
not
sure
your
honor,
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
they
do
get
involved
in
lobbying,
but
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
guess
various
things
which
they
deem
to
be
in
the
interest
of
their
members,
much
the
same
as
the
chamber
of
commerce
would
or
the
nam.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
but
i
cannot,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry,
i
am
not
that
closely
acquainted
with
what
they
do.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
am
sure
they
have
taken
positions
on
alcoholic
rehabilitation
and
treatment
programs
and
questions
of
whether
the
alcoholics
or
drunk
should
be
punished
and
that
sort
of
thing.
in
other
words,
things
that
are
of
interest
to
their
association.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
think
it
is
sufficiently
analogous
to
invoke
equal
protection
principles.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
no,
your
honor,
i
do
no
think
that
the
jaycees...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
i
presume
there
was
a
lot
of
interest
by
the
working
people
of
this
country.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
do
think
the
boy
scouts
have
become
interested
in
a
lot
of
legislation
that
is
of
importance
to
them,
just
like
the
cr
club
does
or
like
any
other
interest
group.
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
jaycees
are
perhaps
broader
than
some
interest
groups,
but
the
relative
breadth
or
narrowness
of
the
interest
group
i
do
not
think
should
be
constitutionally
determinative
of
whether
they
are
accorded
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
there
is
quite
a
bit
in
the
record
about
that.
they
operate
canteens,
they
have
barbeques
and
they
wash
cars
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
prison
inmates.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
they
have
barbeques
and
chicken
fries,
and
they
wash
and
wax
cars
and
they
have..
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yeah,
that
kind
of
thing.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
sir?
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
they
invite
guests
and
family
members
in,
yes
sir,
and
sometimes
they...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
and
sometimes
if
they
are
honor
grade,
they
are
permitted
to
hold
them
out
in
shopping
centers
and
things
like
that.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes
sir,
and
the
money
is
in
turn
used
for
worthwhile
programs,
including
the
health
and
comfort
and
certain
welfare
of
the
inmates,
if
i
am
correctly
informed.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
some
seed
money,
and
there
was
a
grant
i
think
of
$1,000
from
the
afl-cio,
and
then
something
like
$14,000
from
a
national
prison
reform
association,
not
the
national
prison
reform
association,
but
a
charitable
organization
that
gives
such
grants,
i
forgot
the
precise
name.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
the
southern
coalition
for
jails
&
prisoners?
then
there
is
a
provision
for
dues
in
the
bylaws,
although
dues
thus
far
have
not
been
collected,
so
i
suppose...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
it
was
organized
in
the
fall
of
1974,
and
it
existed
six
months
before
the
regulations
in
question
were
adopted.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
that
is
correct,
does
not
go
beyond
the
state.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
it
was
organized
within
the
prison,
working
with
the
outside
interested
people.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
the
district
court
looked
at
what
it
had
done
and
determined
no
indication
of
any
wrongdoing
or
any
illegal
conduct
was
there,
and
of
course
we
rely
on...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
quite
a
bit.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
roughly
one
prisoner
in
seven
had
joined
the
union,
they
published
a
number
of
newsletters,
and
they
had
quite
a
few
activities.
so
i
would
say
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of...
mr.
norman
b.
smith
we
think
the
record
satisfactorily
establishes
that,
and
of
course
as
to
the
post-judgment
experience,
that
is
not
within
the
record,
but
we
are
satisfied
that
if
ever
that
should
be
examined,
there
would
be
no
indication
of
any
harm
to
any
valid
correctional
interest.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
that
is
a
tough
question,
if
your
honor
please.
but
surely
they
have
some
discretion
to
keep
themselves
from
being
literally
overrun
with
organizations.
i
do
not
conceive
that
that
is
likely
to
happen,
but
if
it
does
i
suppose
a
suitable
remedy
can
be
devised
for
it.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
initially
by
the
correction
administrators,
subject
to
court
review
if
it
is
judicially
challenged.
mr.
norman
b.
smith
well,
i
would
hope
that
would
not
be
necessary,
your
honor.
we
agree
that
a
lot
of
what
they
do
is
right,
like
their
new
regulation,
we
are
not
about
to
challenge,
we
think
it
is
right,
the
one
that
regulates
time,
place
and
manner.
but
we
certainly
cannot
conceive
that
putting
the
union
out
of
business
was
right.
thank
you,
sir.
