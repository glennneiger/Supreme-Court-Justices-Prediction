unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
this?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
reproduced
in
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
this
is
all
post.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
it
bear
on?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
district
court
said
it
would
be
time
enough
at
that
point
to
grant
you
relief
and
certainly
indicated
it
would
grant
relief
if
that
happened.
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
we
are
waiting
to
hear
you
argue.
unknown
speaker
this
was
in
your
own
institution?
unknown
speaker
could
that
have
been
done
without
the
cooperation
of
officials
within
the
institution?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
they
have
had
it
without
the
cooperation
of
the
officials?
unknown
speaker
in
the
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
a
man
build
up
that
kind
of
an
institution
within
a
prison
walls
without
the
officials
knowing
about
it?
unknown
speaker
they
did
know
about
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
could
i
ask
you
two
questions?
is
there
anything
in
the
district
court’s
findings
relating
to
the
problem
of
the
older
inmates?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
on
that
subject?
unknown
speaker
and
he
describes
that
as
a
danger?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
second
question,
because
i
have
two
questions.
do
you
dispute
the
right
of
the
prisoners
to
form
a
union?
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
in
point
one
of
your
brief,
but
the
district
court
said
you
did
not.
unknown
speaker
did
you
change
your
position
or
is
it
the
same?
unknown
speaker
but
did
it
include
an
objection
to
their
forming
a
union?
unknown
speaker
didn’t
the
district
court
agree
with
you
on
that?
it
said
that
they
have
no
right
to
form
or
belong
to
a
labor
union
for
the
purpose
of
taking
concerted
action,
to
force
their
demands
upon
present
administration.
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
disagreeing
with
respect
to
what
the
district
court
ruled
against
you
on.
unknown
speaker
but
attorney
general,
you
won
on
that
issue
in
the
district
court,
didn’t
you?
didn’t
he
rule
for
you
on
the
concerted
action
issue?
unknown
speaker
paragraph
1
on
page
30
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
i
do
not
understand
why
you
are
--
aren’t
you
satisfied
with
that
ruling?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
the
district
court
said
in
effect
you
had
to
treat
this
union
the
same
way
you
treated
the
jaycees?
unknown
speaker
now,
mr.
geller,
under
the
judgment,
not
the
opinion
as
a
whole,
but
under
the
judgment,
if
the
state
excluded
all
of
these
organizations,
they
would
be
in
compliance
--
they
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
court’s
mandate,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
it
is
somewhat
in
conflict
with
their
finding
that
there
was
no
right
to
join
a
union,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
three
or
four
pages
earlier.
unknown
speaker
was
it
not
correct
that
in
the
district
court
the
state
acknowledged
that
there
was
a
right
to
join
a
union?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
the
district
court
said,
the
state
acknowledged
in
this
regard
is
wrong
there,
too,
then?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
district
court
had
said
that
north
carolina
allowed
them
to
join
the
union,
not
that
north
carolina
acknowledged
the
constitutional
right
to
join
a
union.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
is
this
certificate
of
incorporation
of
the
union
in
the
papers
before
us?
unknown
speaker
does
it
authorize
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
that
is
certainly
is
a
declaration
of
intent,
is
it
not
on
the
part
of
the…?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
hardly
state
that,
if
you
had
that
in
mind,
in
your
articles
of
incorporation,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
did
you
hear
about
the
strikes
in
new
york,
in
san
francisco?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
also
about
the
deposition
of
the
union.
is
it
a
fact
as
stated
in
your
opponent’s
brief
that
after
this
suit
was
filed
the
union
newspaper
stated
that
the
prisoners
should
be
encouraged
to
organize
with
the
right
to
collectively
bargain
for
better
conditions?
unknown
speaker
now,
did
i
understand
you
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
to
say
that
there
was
no
purpose
for
the
union
to
bargain
collectively?
unknown
speaker
as
a
result
of
this
suit
you
have
changed
the
basic
objectives?
unknown
speaker
these
regulations
you
were
just
referring
to,
mr.
smith,
were
the
ones
that
were
challenged
in
the
district
court,
not
the
ones
that
were
issued
after
the
district
court
judgment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
union
should
be
able
to
solicit
authorizations
from
prisoners
for
the
union
to
act
as
collective
bargaining
representative?
unknown
speaker
so
if
they
are
not,
so
how
about
my
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
union
did
that,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
in
its
newspaper,
and
all
of
that,
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
you
have
the
same
reaction
to
forbidding
solicitation
by
prisoners
themselves?
unknown
speaker
just
as
well,
just
like
it
would
be,
you
assert
for
outsiders
to
solicit
either
by
mail
or
by
visitation.
unknown
speaker
exactly,
and
it
does
not
forbid
them
from
soliciting
for
membership
by
visitation,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
by
outsiders?
unknown
speaker
so
none
of
the
facilities
maybe
used
by
anybody
for
solicitation
purposes?
unknown
speaker
well,
some
of
them,
you
would
seem
to
agree,
could
not
probably
be
interdicted,
such
as
seeking
an
authorization
to
act
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
with
the
piece
of
mail
that
you
get,
do
you
send
it
on
to
the
prisoner?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that,
but
do
you
not
send
it
on
to
the
prisoner,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question.
unknown
speaker
alright,
you
give
notice
and
then
you
have
whatever
kind
of
procedure
you
want,
and
you
are
the
neutral
observer
and
you
are
going
to
decide
it.
you
look
at
it
and
you
see
it
is
a
solicitation
for
collective
bargaining
representation,
now
would
you
send
it
on
to
him
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
going
to
withhold
an
interdict
delivery
of
that
piece
of
mail.
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
interdict
it,
nevertheless.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
then
that
every
piece
of
mail
you
are
talking
about
was
not
validly
interdicted?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it
was
never
opened?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
what
was
in
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
know
what
was
in
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
want
more
than
permission
to
solicit
from
outside,
you
would
not
be
satisfied
with
the
decision
here
that
said,
well,
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
insofar
as
it
forbade
solicitation
on
the
premises.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
that
you
would
not
be
satisfied
with
just
permission
for
outside
solicitation?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
include,
do
i
understand,
having
outside
organizers
come
in
to
solicit.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
prison
administrators
should
make
their
own
value
judgments
on
the
purposes
and
the
qualifications
of
these
outside
groups
coming
in
to
carry
on
activity?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
agree
with,
i
think
mr.
geller
suggested
in
response
to
a
question
that
i
put
that
if
they
just
excluded
everybody,
then
that
would
be
a
compliance
with,
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
this
judgment.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn’t
the
district
court
cast
it
precisely
on
terms
that
the
so-called
union
must
have
the
same
rights
measured
by
the
same
dimensions
and
boundaries
as
these
other
public
organizations?
unknown
speaker
solicitation
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
by
outsiders?
unknown
speaker
to
prisoners,
and
i
am
speaking
now
of
the
outsiders.
suppose
they
exclude
everybody,
suppose
the
state
simply
says
this
is
too
much
of
a
problem,
we
are
going
to
stop
picking
and
choosing.
no
junior
chamber
of
commerce,
no
boy
scouts,
no
alcoholics
anonymous,
no
organization.
unknown
speaker
you
are
referring
to
paragraphs
1,
2
and
3
of
32
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
i
take
it,
which
is
that
last
part
of
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
but
the
second
clause
of
paragraph
1
of
the
opinion
is
hardly
compatible
with
the
first
clause,
is
it?
the
first
clause
says
inmates
and
all
other
persons,
and
then
after
the
semicolon,
provided
however
that
access
to
inmates
by
outsiders.
so
the
purpose
of
furthering
the
interest
of
the
union
may
be
denied.
unknown
speaker
that
is
putting
it
mildly,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
you
had
been
writing
this
opinion
instead
of
the
judges.
unknown
speaker
now,
in
number
2,
this
is
the
one
i
was
referring
to
specifically,
paragraph
2,
page
32,
from
the
opinion,
if
they
stop
all
mailing,
bulk
mailing
from
all
sources,
then
they
would
not
be
violating
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
do
not
allow
the
junior
chamber
and
the
others
to
hold
any
meetings,
then
they
can
stop
union
from
holding
meetings.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that
is
what
you
are
inviting
the
state
prison
authorities
to
do.
unknown
speaker
i
should
say
not
you,
i
should
say
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fourth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
the
district
court,
i
am
sorry.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
ku
klux
klan?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
have
not
read
its
constitution,
but
i
am
sure
it
reads
very
prettily.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
a
prison
administration
be
entitled
to
determine
that
in
advance
of
say
racial
difficulties
or
racial
violence
in
the
prison,
or
would
it
have
to
await
disorder
and
violence
before
it
moved
in?
unknown
speaker
which
as
i
understand
is
promulgated
under
the
coercion
of
this
court
decree
that
was
left
on
stay.
unknown
speaker
but
these
regulations
were
under
the
compulsion
of
this
court
decree?
unknown
speaker
how,
can
you
tell
necessarily
from
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
an
organization
what
it
--
can
you
not
rely
on
your
actual
knowledge?
a
lot
of
nations
in
the
world
have
very
fine
constitutions
but
they
are
also
dictatorships.
unknown
speaker
to
the
ku
klux
klan?
unknown
speaker
no,
that
is
a
real
question,
it
is
not
out
of
the
air.
unknown
speaker
the
ku
klux
klan
is
an
organization
which
has
members
in
various
places
in
the
united
states,
including
i
would
assume
the
state
of
north
carolina,
some
of
whom
maybe
in
prison.
unknown
speaker
i
am
sure
that
is
not
contained
in
its
constitution,
that
without
really
knowing,
but
i
would
be
morally
certain
that
it
does
not
say
in
its
constitution:
our
purpose
is
to
foment
racial
hatred.
unknown
speaker
is
it
part
of
a
national
organization?
unknown
speaker
because
there
is
something
in
the
record
about
a
similar
union
out
in
california.
unknown
speaker
under
this
decree,
under
this
mandate,
suppose
the
plo,
the
palestine
liberation
organization,
which
has
some
sort
of
de
facto
recognition
in
the
united
nations,
applied
to
come
in
on
the
same
basis
as
these
others.
they
could
not
be
excluded
any
more
than
the
klan
could
be
excluded,
could
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
sure
the
plo
has
its
bylaws,
they
do
not
openly
advocate
terrorism,
but
if
you
take
judicial
notice
that
they
practice
it.
unknown
speaker
all
these
hypothetical
questions
which
are
obviously
quite
far
from
the
present
situation,
suggests
that
the
district
court
maybe
did
not
give
the
deference
it
should
have
given
to
the
judgment
ordinarily
accorded
to
prison
administrators
as
required
by
pell
v.
procunier.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
show
that
the
union
will
engage
in
violence
anymore
than
you
could
show
that
the
plo
or
the
klan
would
engage
in
violence?
how
do
you
show
that
as
to
the
future,
just
on
the
basis
of
their
past
performance?
unknown
speaker
then
you
would
have
another
law
suit
in
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
they
had
acted
properly
then.
unknown
speaker
let
us
forget
the
violence
for
a
moment.
would
you
not
say
the
same
thing
had
happened
if
namely
the
authorities
could
close
down
a
union
if
it
made
some
demands
for
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
you
agree
that
is
illegal
and
that
is
not
proper
union
conduct.
now,
if
the
union
is
going
around
indicating
to
its
members
or
potential
members
that
that
is
its
purpose
and
its
function,
and
then
it
demands
collective
bargaining
to
improve
conditions
in
the
prison,
could
the
state
at
that
point
say,
you
have
just
demonstrated
that
you
are
engaging
in
illegal
conduct
and
we
want
you
out
of
here
now.
could
it
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
now
the
officials
at
this
stage
see
that
they
are
soliciting
authorizations
to
be
a
collective
bargaining
representative,
and
that
is
what
they
are
representing
they
are.
now,
why
must
the
prison
officials
say
oh,
this
is
a
big
joke,
they
know
it
is
illegal,
they
do
not
really
mean
it.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
is
not
what
i
hear
from
the
state.
unknown
speaker
whatever
they
said
then,
that
is
not
what
they
say
now,
and
it
also
is
not
what
the
union’s
papers
say.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
worked
out
in
the
district
court,
i
am
not
sure
i
follow
you.
unknown
speaker
you
do
not
mean
that
the
opinion
was
worked
out
jointly
by.
unknown
speaker
could
you
talk
about
the
people
protection
aspect
of
your
case
a
little
further?
unknown
speaker
which
one
of
these
organizations
that
are
permitted
to
exercise
certain
activities
within
the
prison
would
you
consider
most
closely
analogous
to
the
union?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
how
many
jaycees
there
are?
how
many
members
in
the
prisons?
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
as
many
as
2,000
of
each?
unknown
speaker
do
the
jaycee
chapters
or
organizations
in
north
carolina
support
the
four
legislative
bodies
or
otherwise
their
own
economic
interest?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
legislation
would
a
jaycee
organization
support
for
the
economic
interest
of
its
own
members,
as
diverse
as
membership
in
the
jaycees?
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
an
example?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
alcoholics
anonymous?
unknown
speaker
if
i
read
your
brief
correctly,
on
page
7,
you
list
among
the
goals
of
the
union
the
furtherance
of
economic
and
political
rights
of
prisoners.
unknown
speaker
you
really
think
that,
that
sort
of
goal
is
analogous
to
the
goals
of
jaycees,
which
ordinarily
stage
get
out
the
vote
movements
and
the
like,
really
analogous
to
what
the
union
has
in
mind?
unknown
speaker
have
any
legislative
bodies
in
the
united
states
ever
thought
the
jaycees
were
sufficiently
analogous
to
a
union
to
enact
jaycee
labor
legislation?
unknown
speaker
why
did
the
national
government
think
it
necessary
to
enact
the
nlra?
unknown
speaker
and
there
all
sorts
of
things
called
unfair
labor
practices
on
both
sides,
weren’t
they?
unknown
speaker
and
unions
are
in
the
business
to
promote
the
political
and
economic
activities,
interests
of
their
members
perfectly
properly,
i
am
not
critical
of
that.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
the
boy
scouts
are
analogous?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
what
the
activities
of
the
jaycees
are
with
respect
to
the
north
carolina
prisons?
unknown
speaker
outsiders
do
or
prison
inmates
do?
unknown
speaker
who
are
members?
they
operate
canteens
and..
unknown
speaker
social
and
occupational
activities?
unknown
speaker
in
the
prison?
unknown
speaker
are
these
activities
aimed
at
rehabilitating
the
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
these
barbeques
that
they
run,
do
people
come
in
to
them?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
large
group?
unknown
speaker
and
they
make
money
out
of
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
does
the
record
tell
us
how

now,
how
long
ago
has
the
organization
been
in

and
it
is
a
state
wide
organization
only?
unknown

evidence
of
any
activity,

with

all
these
continuing
problems.

the
contribution
of
the
afl-cio,

there
anything

the

about
a

be
denied
the
right
to
join
the
aa
unit?
