justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
may
i
interrupt
because
i
missed
something,
i
know
both
you
and
the
attorney
general
have
mentioned
that
there
was
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
found
by
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
correct?
i
did
not
find
that
in
the
opinion.
i
thought
the
opinion
was
on
the
first
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
read
it,
what
it
was
saying
was
that
they
have
a
first
amendment
right,
and
the
measure
of
the
right
should
be
the
same
as
is
given
to
these
other
organizations.
i
do
not
think
it
held,
or
did
it,
that
the
failure
to
treat
them
the
same
was
a
violation
to
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't,
you
think
that
is
critical
of
the
district
court’s
analysis,
the
equal
protection
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
if
you
rest
your
response
to
justice
marshall
on
the
goals
of
the
union
as
being
improper,
but
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
tending
to
show
that
the
inmates
intend
to
operate
the
union
to
hamper
and
interfere
with
the
proper
interest
of
government.
so
if
you
are
basing
it
on
goals,
it
seems
to
me
the
finding
forecloses
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
findings
to
that
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
findings
to
that
effect?
i
do
not
think
they
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
we
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
findings,
or
should
we
do
it
de
novo?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
respect
is
it
not
just
like
mr.
justice
marshall,
said
hey,
your
difference
as
i
understand
is
in
their
announced
goals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
district
court
found
the
announced
goals
were
harmless.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
are
asking
us
to
set
aside
the
district
court’s
findings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
maybe
entirely
right
but
that
is
an
argument
for
the
proposition
that
the
findings
are
erroneous,
that
is
what
you
are
arguing,
i
think.
