the
transportation
for
get
an
education
and

isn’t
it?
[voice
overlap]
household
expense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
deprived
from
household
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
why
do
you
draw
the
line
between
tuition
and
travel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
not
talking
about
household,
i’m
talking
about
schooling.
you
can
get
tuition
but
you
can’t
get
the
transportation
and
if
you
don’t
get
to
transportation,
you
can't
use
the
tuition,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
can’t
get
the
transportation,
if
you
can’t
get
to
the
school,
you
don’t
need
tuition.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you’ll
get
credit
for
tuition
providing
you
get
there,
but
you
can’t
get
credit
for
--
on
your
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
is
education
limited
by
household?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
on
household
income,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
normal
person
is
not
on
the
list,
pays
his
tuition
to
college.
you
don’t
put
that
in
your
household
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
the
secretary
but
i
mean
anybody
other
than
the
secretary
that
would
draw
line
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
the
government
said
“everybody
have
the
lowest
certain
income,
we
will
give
you
all
of
your
tuition,
all
of
your
books
and
everything
else,
provided
you
get
there
on
your
own.”
would
that
be
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
that’s
what
you
done?
that’s
what
you
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
get
there
on
your
own.
we
never
give
any
credit
for
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
their
actual
travel
expense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
their
actual
travel
expense,
is
that
in
the
writing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
she
got
$40.00
a
month
and
her
actual
travel
expenses
were
$20.00,
would
the
secretary
be
right
in
not
deducting
$20.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
the
difference
be
in
that
case
--
in
this
case
we
don’t
know
how
much
she
spent?
we
don’t
even
know
if
she
spent
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
you
get
that
information
from?
where
in
the
record
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
24?
justice
thurgood
marshall
say
one
stipulation,
it
doesn’t
do
that
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
days
in
a
week
that
she
goes
to
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
not
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
trying
to
find
out
what
is
in
the
record
that
we
can
use?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
can
we
accept
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can’t
come
here
with
a
record
that
you
pull
out
of
the
thin
air.
we
are
bound
by
the
record
in
this
case
because
i
understand
the
record,
this
case
doesn’t
show
whether
she
was
part
time
or
full
time.
it
doesn’t
show
when
she
went
to
school,
how
many
days
she
went
to
school,
how
far
she
went?
