mr.
robert
bartels
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
appellants
have
indicated,
the
district
court
did
decide
this
case
on
both
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
but
i
think
as
perhaps
both
of
us
have
agreed
that
this
court
need
not
reach
the
constitutional
issues,
and
i
would
therefore
like
to
focus
my
own
remarks
on
the
statutory
issues
in
the
case.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
statutory
and
constitutional
issues
are
interwoven,
although
i
think
they
stand
independently
of
one
another.
mr.
robert
bartels
well
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
have
been
an
interesting
issue.
this
court
has
in
the
past
i
believe
taken
appeals
from
the
three-judge
courts
in
which
the
grounds
where
purely
statutory
and
i
believe
there’s
been
some
dictum.
i
believe
in
hagens
versus
levine,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
permissible
if
it
where
decided
by
three-judges,
but
i
think
that
under
1253,
there
would
have
been
question
whether
this
was
a
case
that
had
to
be
decided
by
three-judges,
and
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i’m
not
aware
of
the
court’s
normal
practice.
i
believe
though
that
in
doe
v.
connecticut,
the
court
did
take
a
case
such
as
this.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
issues
were
addressed,
removes
that
particular
problem
in
this
case
which
i
think
probably
the
reason
the
district
court
did
that
was
more
or
less
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy
that
it
would
present
to
this
court
all
of
the
issues
for
disposition
of
the
case
so
that
if
the
court
disagree
with
it
on
these
statutory
issues,
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
second
remand
in
the
case.
i
think
mr.
urbanczyk
has
described
adequately
the
operation
of
the
food
stamp
program
and
the
importance
in
the
program
of
the
concept
that
income
--
appellee
hein’s
case
in
effect
illustrates
the
importance
of
income
because
her
training
allowance
was
included
in
income,
her
food
stamp
benefits
correspondingly
were
decreased.
now,
the
district
court’s
order
in
this
case
enjoined
the
appellants
from
including
in
income
for
food
stamp
purposes,
any
allowances
received
for
necessary
commuting
in
connection
with
individual
education
and
training
plans.
now,
this
decision
was
proper
on
two
separate
statutory
grounds.
first,
although
the
secretary
clearly
does
--
mr.
robert
bartels
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that,
although
they
would
appear
to
be
some
inequality
there,
the
real
inequality
is
in
the
title
20
program
that
the
one
neighbor
was
not
getting
the
assistance.
now,
the
difference
here
is
that
the
neighbors,
i
understand
that
has
$44.00
earned
income
as
opposed
to
--
mr.
robert
bartels
right.
all
of
her
income
is
earned
income.
now,
what
that
means
is
that
she
legitimately
has
the
choice
of
how
to
spend
that
money.
she
may
choose
to
spend
it
on
educational
commuting,
but
she
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
bartels
well
you
honor,
if
i
may
persist
with
that,
the
crucial
factor
here
is
the
choice
that
she
has
not
to
take
the
education.
if
she
were
to
choose
let’s
say
to
spend
that
$44.00
on
normal
household
expenses,
she
would
still
get
the
same
amount
of
income.
her
total
income
and
food
stamp
allowance
would
not
be
affected.
however,
if
a
person
in
ms.
hein’s
situation
decides
to
divert
the
$44.00
away
from
educational
expenses,
she
is
going
to
lose
it,
and
that
the
secretary
here
has
correctly
pointed
out
physically
--
mr.
robert
bartels
well
your
honor,
i
suppose
that
then
we’re
talking
about
was
the
$44.00
allowance
was
really
necessary
and
then,
it
wouldn’t
covered
by
the
district
court’s
order.
then
we’ve
got
the
administrators
of
the
individual
education
training
plans
who
happen
to
be
the
same
as
the
administrators
of
the
food
stamp
program
in
iowa.
in
the
rather
peculiar
position
of
sort
of
giving
away
this
$44.00
to
someone
who
doesn’t
need
it
and
your
honor
that
would
mean
that
they’re
expecting
that
that
money
would
be
divertable
to
normal
living
costs
that
are
covered
by
afdc,
and
that
would
be
indirect
contravention
of
42
u.s.c.
1397
c2h
which
says
that
the
benefits
under
title
20
may
not
be
used
for
the
same
sorts
of
things
that
are
covered
by
afdc.
mr.
robert
bartels
that’s
not
clear
at
all
from
the
record,
and
i
frankly
have
not
been
able
to
determine
whether
ms.
hein
was
on
a
full
time
or
part
time
plan,
but
i
think,
it’s
really
not
particularly
important
either
way
here
your
honor.
on
the
record
of
this
case
--
mr.
robert
bartels
well
you
honor,
i’m
not
sure
in
ms.
hein’s
case.
clearly,
that
would
--
mr.
robert
bartels
alright,
with
regard
to
the
general
program
your
honor,
we
have
to
talk
about
two
groups;
part
time
trainees
and
full
time
trainees.
part
time
trainees
receive
a
mileage
allowance
so
that
if
such
a
recipient
move
from
muscatine
to
davenport,
the
travel
allowance
would
go
down,
and
that
person
would
only
receive
of
that
amount
money
that
really
was
for
necessary
commuting.
now,
the
full
time
--
mr.
robert
bartels
it’s
called
a
participant
trainee
in
a
part
time
individual
education
training
program.
now
--
mr.
robert
bartels
okay,
now
a
somewhat
more
complex
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
absolutely
no
problem
with
the
district
court’s
rationale
or
order
with
regard
to
these
part
time
students.
now,
with
regard
to
the
full
time
students,
it
is
more
complex.
what
would
happen
here
is
that
--
i
think
the
order
is
not
perfectly
clear
what
would
happen
with
a
full
time
student
who
let’s
say
moved
to
davenport.
if
we
assume
that
not
all
of
the
$44.00
or
$60.00
a
month
was
needed
for
educational
travel
and
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
possibilities
under
the
order.
one
is
that
the
order
doesn’t
apply
at
all
because
the
allowance
is
not
for
necessary
travel
expenses.
mr.
robert
bartels
that’s
right
your
honor.
now,
i
think
that
it
could
be
interpret
--
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
that’s
right
your
honor.
but
the
--
mr.
robert
bartels
that’s
right
your
honor.
but
the
district
court’s
order
is
if
it
were
interpreted
in
that
way
would
allow
the
reduction
of
food
stamp
[voice
overlap]
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor.
it
[voice
overlap]
it
was
not
all,
it
was
never
presented
as
a
distinction
in
the
district
court,
and
that’s
i
think
perhaps
why
it
doesn’t
cover
very
clearly.
now,
i
think
that
under
the
district
court’s
rationale
and
under
a
fair
interpretation
what
ought
to
happen
here
is
that
there
should
be
a
determination
of
what
portion
of
the
$60.00
a
month
really
was
for
necessary
educational
commuting
expenses.
and,
that
portion
would
not
be
included
on
income.
now,
that
does
require
that
system
were
adopted,
that
one
require
--
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
it
would
be
that
at
all.
first
of
all,
one
could
adopt
exactly
the
same
system
that
the
appellant’s
have
already
adopted
with
regard
to
part
time
students,
namely
use
mileage
as
the
measure.
secondly
your
honor,
this
is
no
more
difficult
a
task
in
accounting
for
child
care
expenses
which
are
deducted
out
in
fact
under
the
administrative
regulations.
and
finally
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
believe
it’s
the
actual
charge
by
the
vendor
of
the
so
to
speak
of
the
child
care.
the
other
thing
that
frankly,
i
neglected
to
point
out
in
the
briefing
that
may
have
some
impact
on
this
administrative
convenience
argument
is
that
all
participants
in
individual
education
and
training
programs
in
iowa
are
afdc
recipients.
now,
with
regard
to
such
recipients,
federal
regulations
require
that
income
from
loans
and
grants
not
be
included
in
afdc
income
for
purposes
for
determining
eligibility
and
levels
of
benefits
to
the
extent
that
those
grants
are
not
usable
for
current
living
costs
and
that
is
essentially
the
identical
determination
of
necessity.
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
any
additional
burden
here.
i
might
add
your
honor
that
in
terms
of
the
state
of
iowa’s
purported
interest
here
in
this
administrative
convenience,
the
statute
under
which
this
program
is
authorized
in
iowa
itself
requires
that
in
determining
the
need
for
public
assistance
that
the
expenses
and
so
on
related
to
the
individual
education
training
programs
be
taken
into
account.
so
again,
iowa
itself
has
indicated
that
these
kind
of
consideration
ought
to
be
taken
into
account,
that’s
iowa
code
section
249
c.11.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
that
probably
was.
i
really
can’t
tell
it.
it
was
not
tailor
made
in
the
sense
that
there
was
clearly
a
maximum
amount.
it
could
not
have
been
tailor
made
above
$44.00.
mr.
robert
bartels
if
the
friend
were
in
a
full
time
training
program,
yes
your
honor,
the
friend
would
also
have
received
$44.00.
now,
again
really
the
record
does
not
reflect,
it
was
never
raised
as
a
question
and
the
materials
that
i
have
outside
the
record
are
sort
of
conflicting
on
whether
ms.
hein
was
regarded
as
a
full
time
or
a
part
time
student.
again,
insofar
as
some
portion
of
the
$44.00
might
not
be
necessary
for
the
transportation
of
the
friend,
and
i
think
under
the
district
court’s
order
as
fairly
interpreted,
only
that
portion
that
was
necessary
for
commuting
would
be
required
to
be
excludable
from
this
amount
of
income.
i
might
add
your
honor
that
this
is
essentially
the
same
kind
of
problem
that
this
court
faced
although
i
don't
recall
any
articulation
of
the
administrative
convenience
problem
in
shea
versus
vialpando.
again,
there
had
to
be
an
individualized
determination.
mr.
robert
bartels
pardon?
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
the
only
indication
of
it
is
that
the
allowance
was
for
necessary
commuting
and
that
she
did
the
commuting
and
from
that,
the
district
court
i
think
properly
found
that
all
the
money
had
been
spent.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
the
district
court's
order
rationale
that
it
would
be
proper
to
not
include
only
$20.00
worth
of
that.
now,
that
doesn’t
--
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
i
think
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
all
spent
and
that
was
a
proper
inference
from
the
material.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
it’s
in
the
stipulation
paragraph,
i
guess
the
easiest
way
is
at
paragraph
6
of
the
stipulation
which
is
on
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
robert
bartels
indicates
that
the
transportation
allowance
was
for
necessary
commuting
expenses
in
connection
with
the
individual
education
and
training
plan,
and
then
paragraph
12
of
the
same
stipulation
on
the
same
page
--
mr.
robert
bartels
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
what’s
happened
here
is
that
the
district
court
was
being
very
careful
to
make
a
narrow
--
a
very
narrow
order
that
didn’t
bind
in
the
usta
or
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
it
would
certainly
be
permissible
here
for
the
secretary
to
respond
to
this
holding
by
accounting
for
these
expenses.
in
order
words,
doing
exactly
what
was
required
in
shea
versus
vialpando,
but
the
district
court’s
order
does
not
require
the
secretary
to
go
quite
that
far
and
would
permit
some
administratively
more
convenient
system
than
that.
in
other
words,
assuming
that
the
--
for
example
that
the
allowance
was
necessary
on
the
basis
of
the
administrative
judgment
made
by
individual
education
training
plan
administrators.
and
of
course,
there
is
a
difference
in
this
case
because
we’re
talking
here
about
allowances
and
the
court’s
orders
clearly
restricted
to
that,
the
extent
of
the
allowance.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
if
it’s
a
matter
of
misjudgment,
i
don’t
think
that
they
really
have
any
legitimate
fear
for
contempt
and
they
are
certainly
still
the
opportunity
for
them
to
ask
for
clarification
of
the
order
and
one
that
requires,
or
this
court
could
clarify
the
order
and
then
order
be
amended.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
she
would
still
get
the
allowance.
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
basis
and
i
think
everybody
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
there
is
--
i
think,
there
maybe
a
small
loop
hole
there
in
the
allowance.
on
the
other
hand,
unless
one
is
an
awfully
good
hitch
hiker
or
has
a
friend,
there
are
going
to
be
those
kinds
of
expenses
associated
with
commuting
that
distance,
particularly
if
she
has
in
fact
the
full
time.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor
again,
--
mr.
robert
bartels
records
not
clear
on
that,
no.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
main
problem
at
this
point
that
the
court
ought
to
address
is
people
in
the
future
and
it
is
clear
that
however
karen
hein
was
treated
and
however
her
expenses,
actual
expenses
broke
down
that
we
do
have
left
in
this
case
two
basic
groups
of
people,
part
time
ietp
students
and
full
time
ietp
students.
and
with
regard
of
the
full
time
ones
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
but
what
they
would
get
the
allowance,
the
full
$60.00
a
month.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
we
don’t
know.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
she
can
certainly
represent
the
group
of
people
who
received
these
individual
education
and
training
allowances.
mr.
robert
bartels
well
your
honor,
it’s
really
just
a
matter
of
sort
of
the
administration
and
not
the
theory
of
the
fact.
mr.
robert
bartels
you
honor,
i
think
that
if
one
assumed
that
karen
hein
were
a
full
time
student
here,
which
seems
to
be
that
the
assumption
that
the
secretary
wants
to
make
and
which
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
accept,
then
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
the
stipulation
was
that
it
was
an
allowance
for
necessary
commuting
expenses,
and
the
district
court
regarded
that
as
sufficient
together
with
the
other
facts.
i
might
add
that
there
was
an
affidavit
that
was
totally
unopposed
from
ms.
hein
saying
that
this
was
reimbursement
for
necessary
commuting
expenses
and
i
think
certainly,
the
understanding
of
the
word
reimbursement
would
be
that
the
money
was
actually
expended,
and
i
think
the
district
court’s
findings
of
that
are
supported
perhaps
that
the
loophole
that
exist
and
the
stipulation
has
to
be
taken
care
off
by
the
additional
record
that’s
supplied
by
the
affidavit
which
is
on
--
begins
on
page
1b
of
the
appellee's
briefs.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
and
in
fact,
that’s
the
good
point
because
when
it
went
back
down
your
honor,
the
district
court
had
made
its
findings
of
fact
which
included
the
fact
that
this
was
for
necessary
commuting
expenses
and
that
in
fact,
the
money
was
spent.
there
was
no
effort
at
all
by
the
appellants
to
dispute
that.
there
was
never
any
dispute
about
those
findings
of
fact
in
the
district
court
despite
ample
opportunity
to
do
so,
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
robert
bartels
well
your
honor,
the
plaintiff
did.
nevertheless
your
honor,
i
think
one
with
district
court
makes
a
finding
that’s
supportable
by
the
affidavits
and
materials
in
the
record
that
if
you
disagree
with
that
the
time
to
do
it
is
at
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
robert
bartels
well
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
it
doesn’t,
your
honor.
although,
there
are
i
think
clear
indications
in
the
entire
structure
of
the
act
and
its
purpose
that
this
must
--
because
that’s
what
determines
benefits.
mr.
robert
bartels
2011
is
choose
the
purpose
and
i
think
also
quite
important
in
terms
of
showing
the
connection
that
congress
saw
between
income
and
food
purchasing
power,
section
2014
(a)
says
that
the
program
is
to
be
limited
to
those
households
whose
income
and
other
resources
are
found
to
be
limiting
factor
on
the
ability
to
purchase
--
mr.
robert
bartels
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
bartels
whether
the
secretary
has
exceeded
his
authority
or
has
exercised
in
terms
of
i
believe,
it
would
be
2013
(c)
your
honor,
whether
the
secretary
has
exercised
his
authority
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
food
stamp
act.
mr.
robert
bartels
there’s
no
question
that
the
secretary
has
very
broad
authority
in
that
they’re
sort
of
basic
purchase
price
levels
that
he
sets
for
particular
levels
of
income
and
so
on
is
almost
total
extent
within
the
secretary’s
authority.
but
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
it’s
not
directly
contrary
to
any
clear
definition
of
income.
it
is
contrary
though
i
think
to
the
clear
intent
of
the
act
that
income
because
it
--
the
terms
level
of
benefits
mustn’t
be
related
to
the
household’s
food
purchasing
power.
mr.
robert
bartels
well
your
honor,
the
language
of
the
statute
that
indicates
that
this
and
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
increase
food
purchasing
power
in
that
income
is
to
be
related
to
food
purchasing
power.
again,
i
think
2014
(a)
is
the
clear
--
mr.
robert
bartels
[voice
overlap]
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
i
believe
[voice
overlap]
i
believe
purchasing
power
is
used
in
2011,
but
you’re
right
that
for
the
most
part,
it
has
become
a
means
of
speaking
about
of
the
ability
of
a
household
to
purchase
food,
to
make
food
purchases.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
that
the
next
sentence
--
mr.
robert
bartels
that
is
one
of
the
issues,
your
honor.
the
other
problem
in
this
case
is
that
both
of
food
stamp
--
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
i
think
the
second
statutory
issue
has
to
do
with
2014
(c)
in
title
20.
2014
(c)
indicates
that
the
secretary
isn't
for
the
operation
of
the
food
stamp
act
and
should
not
act
as
a
disincentive
to
education.
now,
i
think
that
district
court
overstated
it
by
saying
that
there
was
to
be
an
encouragement.
mr.
robert
bartels
but
i
think
to
not
provide
disincentives
is
clearly
there
and
that’s
very
strongly
supported
by
title
20
which
funded
the
individual
education
and
training
program
and
the
allowances
involved.
the
purpose
--
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
it’s
not.
mr.
robert
bartels
that’s
right
your
honor,
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
2014
(c)
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
the
district
court
found
that
it
violated
food
stamp
act
because
of
the
disincentive
to
education.
but
i
think,
it
also
is
fair
to
say
that
the
secretary
of
agriculture
cannot
because
he
is
only
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
violate
title
20
of
the
social
security
act
or
defeat
the
purposes
of
congress
that
are
expressed
in
that
particular
title,
particularly
when
the
food
stamp
act
itself
indicates
a
congressional
intent
that
the
food
stamp
act
should
not
operate
to
be
a
disincentive
to
this
kind
of
education.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
that’s
a
reference
and
the
students
are
exempted
from
the
work
registration
requirement.
the
practical
effect
of
that
is
that
you
maybe
a
student
in
one
of
these
programs
and
still
receive
food
stamps.
otherwise,
you
would
not
be
able
to
do
that
unless
you
happened
to
be
particularly
unemployable.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
chance
that
you
would
actually
find
the
job
through
work
registration.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
in
title
20,
i
don’t
believe
so
and
certainly
iowa
is
perfectly
free
not
to
participate
in
at
all.
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
that
would
raise
a
question
if
there
is
this
training
program
and
there
is
not
sufficient
allowances
to
allow
say
an
afdc
recipient
to
participate,
that
might
raise
a
problem
under
title
20,
but
not
on
the
--
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
because
in
there’s
no
impact
on
food
purchasing
power
and
there’s
no
disincentive
to
education
from
the
food
stamp
act
that
then
becomes
disincentive
from
title
20
and
certainly
the
state
of
iowa
--
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
that
the
allowance
exceeds
the
needs,
that
maybe
taken
into
account
in
food
stamp
calculations
and
reduce
the
benefits
so
that
there
would
be
no
greater
disincentive
at
the
amounts
that
are
above
what’s
necessary
for
the
educational
travel.
it’s
only
up
to
the
point
to
which
it’s
necessary.
mr.
robert
bartels
it’s
the
stipulation
that
was
for
necessary
commuting
in
connection
with
the
individual
education
and
training
plan.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
that’s
the
way
the
district
court
has
read
the
stipulations
and
affidavits
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
bartels
for
necessary.
mr.
robert
bartels
well
your
honor,
i
think
if
we
are
talking
about
a
full
time
student,
one
couldn’t
even
say
that
it
was
for
necessary
commuting.
i
think
that
the
way
in
which
the
district
court
interpreted
that
in
combination
with
the
rest
of
the
stipulation
and
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted
in
this
case
was
that
the
grant
was
for
necessary
commuting
and
that
in
fact
it
was
all
spent
to
defray
those
expenses.
mr.
robert
bartels
that’s
correct
your
honor.
at
least
insofar
as
the
allowance
was
for
necessary
commuting.
what
the
secretary’s
policy
in
effect
as
your
honor
is
it
presumes
for
every
recipient
that
all
of
the
training
related
expense
allowance
is
unnecessary
for
travel
and
it’s
freely
available
for
food
and
living
cost.
that’s
just
an
irrational
policy
that
doesn’t
give
the
recipient
any
opportunity
to
challenge
or
rebut
that
particular
presumption.
thank
you.
