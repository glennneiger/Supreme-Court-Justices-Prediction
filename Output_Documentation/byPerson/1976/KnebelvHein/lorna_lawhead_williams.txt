ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
lorna
williams.
i’m
one
of
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
iowa
and
there
is
a
little
irony
in
this
particular
lawsuit
for
the
reason
that
the
very
people
that
iowa
would
like
to
help
under
this
modification
of
the
regulation
prevents
them
from
doing
so
because
they
are
trying
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
trainees
in
iowa’s
individual
program.
it
means
that
first,
they
are
not
unlimited
sources
to
go
upon,
but
iowa
is
proud
that
it
is
high
in
giving
adc
benefits,
8th
or
11th
depending
on
how
you
figure
it
from
the
top
on
adc.
iowa
has
this
individual
training
program
which
most
states
don’t
have.
it’s
had
the
program
since
1969.
it
can
continue
to
provide
this
kind
of
thing
for
the
people
in
iowa
or
anyone
who
comes
there
and
can
qualify
and
it
is
not
limited
to
a
bread
and
butter
course.
it
even
offers
a
bachelor
of
arts
degree
if
someone
is
in
need
and
eligible
to
do
that
kind
of
work.
the
particular
regulation
here
in
the
retroactive
aspect
is
particularly
harsh
on
iowa.
for
here,
iowa
all
these
years
has
been
passing
on
to
the
beneficiaries,
the
trainees,
the
amount
of
money
you’d
thought
it
would
take
in
administrative
time
and
cost.
they’ve
already
passed
the
saving
on
and
instead
of
making
a
day-by-day
calculation
of
how
much
did
each
food
stamp
and
individual
trainee
for
that
course
spend
for
commuting,
it
just
gave
them
across
the
board
allowance.
that’s
not
unlike
the
way
the
win
program
treats
the
people
there
also.
the
win
people
get
a
$30.00
a
month
allowance
unaccountable
no
restrictions
on
it,
plus
$1.00
for
lunch
a
day,
$1.00
for
travel
a
day
whether
it's
used
or
not,
so
that
it's
about
the
same
in
both
programs,
there’s
approximately
$60.00
or
$69.00
in
iowa
in
our
training
program
too,
$60.00
that's
available
to
this
people,
they
can
save
it
if
they
want
to.
they
can
move
to
the
location
of
their
school
if
they
want
to,
none
of
their
rights
or
benefits
will
be
taken
away
from
them.
they
can
--
perhaps
they
can
use
it
even
on
household
items
if
they
need
to.
maybe
they
move
to
the
college
campus
and
the
rent's
going
to
be
$10.00
a
month
more
just
because
they
move
to
davenport.
there
is
no
nothing
that
in
that
title
19,
or
excuse
me
title
20
program
which
is
where
iowa
gets
part
--
its
funds
for
its
individual
training
program
that
says
it
cannot
be
used
on
that
because
it’s
beyond
the
expectation
of
ordinary
household
item.
music
schools
are
included
in
that
thing
even.
the
win
program,
there
is
one
checking
that
is
required
of
our
people
who
administer
that
program
also.
they
must
check
at
the
school
to
see
if
someone
was
intent
--
in
attendance,
but
they
do
not
make
the
people
say
“oh,
i
skipped
lunch
today
and
used
the
dollar
for
something
else
or
i
hitch
to
ride
to
school
and
saved
the
dollar.”
they
have
the
right
to
that
if
they
want
to.
they
don’t
have
to
account
for
the
money
and
it
could
very
well
discourage
people
from
coming
into
the
food
stamp
program
if
they
had
to
account
for
of
how
much
money
they
are
going
to
get,
how
they
spend
it.
same
way,
it
could
hurt
our
trainees
if
they
had
to.
'we
don’t
require
of
them
and
yet
now,
except
this
law,
this
regulation
as
set
out
by
the
court,
the
modification
to
the
regulation
would
so
require
so
the
people
may
then
become
discouraged
and
not
want
to
come
into
either
program.
the
trainees
that
add
to
our
area
11
school
right
there
in
encony
came
to
our
state
house
and
complained
because
they
felt
as
though
they
have
been
singled
out
by
having
to
have
them
be
checked
at
the
schools
to
their
school
attendance,
days
in
attendance.
iowa
doesn’t
really
--
iowa
wants
to
help
the
people
and
not
hinder
them
and
it’s
not
uncommon
now
for
people
in
one
program
to
be
recipients
and
beneficiaries
in
another
welfare
program
and
one
should
not
curtail
the
activities
of
the
other.
the
federal
court
under
the
eleventh
amendment
really
shouldn’t
be
spending
iowa’s
money
that
way.
when
iowa
has
determined,
it
would
rather
give
it
to
the
beneficiaries
and
have
given
to
them.
and
now
to
be
called
back
and
spend,
we
figured
3,400
who
have
gone
through
our
program
since
complaint
has
been
filed
to
review
month
by
month,
every
single
food
stamp
calculation,
recalculate
it,
month
by
month.
it
would
take
one
person
your
honors
at
eight
hours
a
day
if
you
average
it,
once
you’ve
identify
him,
it
take
eight
--
between
10
and
13
years,
one
stamp
person.
if
we
have
to
go
back
now,
to
carry
out
the
court
order,
if
it
took
an
average
of
eight
to
identify
the
people,
locate
them,
have
them
go
from
their
records
or
recollections
because
food
stamp
the
law
says
you
have
to
verify
everything.
so,
it’s
the
--
they
placed
upon
the
state
of
iowa
an
almost
impossible
burden
to
say
nothing
of
the
amount
of
money
that
would
have
to
be
spent
on
step
time
to
do
it
at
the
expense
of
the
very
people
in
the
class
for
bringing
the
action
against
the
state
of
iowa.
i
notice,
you
asked
the
question
a
while
ago
as
to
why
the
court
went
ahead
and
gave
its
opinion
on
the
constitutional
questions
and
it’s
kind
of
interesting.
the
federal
government,
once
we
got
them
into
the
court,
took
over
in
the
trial
at
the
lower
court,
but
the
briefs
of
the
appellee
in
both
the
first
trial
before
it
was
remanded
and
in
this
trial
had
contained
the
constitutional
questions
and
it
could
well
be
that
the
--
it
could
well
be
that
court
wasn’t
quite
so
sure
that
about
why
it
should
have
put
it
on
the
statutory
basis.
it
to
me,
it
really
think
--
i
really
think
that
congress
in
no
way
intended
to
encourage
the
people
in
the
food
stamp
program
to
go
into
education
nor
to
intend
to
discourage.
we
just
said
you
just
don’t
have
to
come
to
work,
you
don’t
have
to
--
you
can
get
your
food
stamps
without
going
to
work
or
without
applying
or
trying
to
get
a
job
if
you
are
bona
fide
student
and
i
think
that’s
all
what
they
did.
i
think
there
was
indifference
to
the
iowa’s
program
which
most
states
don’t
have.
iowa’s
program
and
some
of
the
other
federal
programs;
there
were
14
in
iowa
within
the
last
few
years,
i
listed
them,
i
couldn’t
believe
it
had
been
14
training
programs
in
iowa.
but
anyhow,
i
think
it
was
indifference
to
those
training
programs,
all
of
which
give
unrestricted
allowance,
just
as
an
incentive
for
people
to
take
the
program,
that
the
secretary
while
included
them,
then
gave
across
the
broad
disallowance.
he
said,
we
don’t
--
we
just
take
off
10%,
some
of
you
don’t
spend
one
penny
of
it,
some
of
you
may
spend
all
of
it,
but
we'll
take
10,
just
10%
for
everyone
and
the
people
somehow
including
ms.
hein
was
able
to
manage
to
buy
her
total
food
stamps.
so,
maybe
she
had
to
buy
all
$12.00
a
month
for
her
schooling.
think
of
our
children
who
have
student
loans,
who
payback
the
whole
thing,
tuition
and
all.
i
mean
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
in
his
third
brief,
he
attaches
her
own
affidavit
where’s
that
--
all
through,
she’s
talking
about
she
had
to
buy
the
food
stamps
by
paying
$12.00
more.
she
paid
$56.00,
$58.00
more.
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
no,
your
honor.
this
is
what
i
point
out
in
my
reply
brief.
in
her
affidavit,
she
said
that
she
was
buying
the
stamps,
but
it
cost
her
more
money.
in
their
arguments
to
the
court
and
in
their
brief
here,
they
talk
about
it
just
cost
her
more
money.
but
where,
except
in
one
place
in
the
briefs
cited
the
attorney
stipulation
which
said
if
she
was
called
to
testify
and
he
attached
it
to
the
attorney
for
--ms.
hein
attached
it
to
his
brief
and
it
appears
at
page
26,
it
appears
--
the
affidavit
of
ms.
hein
appears
at
--
in
the
appellant’s
brief,
appellee’s
brief
at
page
affidavit
at
page
1b
and
there
she
says
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
at
page
1b
your
honor.
it
says
that
she
has
been
getting
$44.00
for
necessary
commuting.
she
says
that
she
--
and
she’s
been
paying
food
stamps
$58.00.
so,
she
was
able
to
go
ahead
and
pay
her
food
stamps.
now
in
the
stipulation,
she
--
signed
by
her
attorney,
it
says
that
if
she
had
been
called
to
testify
that
she
would
testify
that
she
had
to
buy
her
a
lot
of
food
stamps
coupons,
but
she
really
did.
she
was
able
somehow
to
make
do
with
what
she
had
in
order
to
get
the
amount
of
food
stamps
to
which
she
was
entitled.
she
got
a
full
allotment
and
i
see,
i’m
running
into
time
of
my
co-counsel.
and
if
there
--
ms.
lorna
lawhead
williams
but
your
honor,
i
want
to
save
my
little
time
for
rebuttal
for
both
of
us.
unless
there
other
questions.
