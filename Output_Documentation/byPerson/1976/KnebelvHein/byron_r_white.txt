justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
the
district
court
hadn’t
reached
the
constitutional
ground,
the
case
wouldn’t
be
here
at
all,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
will
be
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understand,
there
was
a
stipulation
in
this
case
says
that
$40.00
was
necessary
for
travel
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
district
court
accepted
that?
that
is
a
fact
in
the
case
that
the
$40.00
was
necessary
for
commuting
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
just
wanted
to
get
the
--
your
colleague's
view
of
the
stipulation
because
in
his
brief,
he
said
the
stipulation
was
that
the
--
it
was
stipulated
in
district
court
that
the
monthly
allowance
received
was
for
commuting
that
was
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
the
district
court
construed
the
stipulation
as
establishing
the
fact
that
the
expense
was
necessary
for
commuting?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
necessary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
wasn’t
the
court
find
it,
don’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
the
district
court
did
find
that
in
this
case
the
$40.00
was
necessary?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
accept
that
for
the
purpose
of
your
argument?
