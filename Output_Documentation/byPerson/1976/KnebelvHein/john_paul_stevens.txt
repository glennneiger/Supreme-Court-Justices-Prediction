justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
williams,
i
thought
your
opponent
said
that
she
was
not
able
to
buy
all
her
food
stamps
after
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn’t
she
say
that
she
couldn’t
afford
the
$12.00
and
therefore,
she
got
the
lesser
quota
of
food
stamps?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bartels,
before
you
get
into
the
explanation
of
it,
i’d
like
to
get
one
thing
sorted
out
in
my
own
mind.
your
client
received
$220.00
in
the
afdc,
$28.75
rent
allowance
and
$44.00
training
allowance,
so
$272.75
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
she
had
a
next
door
neighbor
who
worked
as
a
--
did
household
work
of
some
kind
and
earned
$272.75,
and
also
took
training
at
the
university
to
become
a
nurse
just
did
everything
else
exactly
the
same
except
her
income
was
from
private
sources
rather
than
public
sources.
under
the
district
court’s
order,
do
you
understand
that
there
would
be
a
differential
between
those
two
people
and
what
food
stamps
they
might
receive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
just
has
a
net
of
$272.75.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
she
decided
to
go
to
school
just
like
your
client
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
different
choices
does
she
have
having
made
that
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
she
has
able
to
hitch
hike
to
work?
justice
john
paul
stevens
[voice
overlap]
care
on
so
much
for
child
or
is
it
actual
money
spent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bartels,
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
would
prevent
iowa
from
terminating
the
$44.00
allowance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
and
that
of
course,
that
wouldn’t
raise
any
question
under
the
food
stamp
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what’s
you
are
saying
if
i
understand
you,
is
the
more
travel
allowance
she
gets,
the
greater
the
disincentive
because
it
reduces
the
food
stamp,
you
know,
a
percentage
of
that
is
taken
away
from
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
program
administered
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
cooperating
state
agencies
pursuant
to
the
food
stamp
act
of
1964,
certain
low
income
households
are
entitled
to
purchase
food
coupons
at
a
discount.
the
price
and
eligible
household
must
pay
for
foodstamps
as
determined
and
part
by
its
income
as
defined
in
applicable
federal
and
state
regulations.
under
those
regulations,
the
transportation
allowance
which
appellee
receives
from
the
state
of
iowa
and
uses
to
defray
the
cost
of
commuting
to
a
nurse’s
training
program
is
treated
as
income.
the
questions
presented
on
this
appeal
are
whether
those
regulations
are
authorized
by
the
statute,
and
if
so,
whether
they
are
constitutional.
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
southern
district
of
iowa
held
that
the
regulations
were
invalid.
for
reasons
stated
and
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
unanimously
reversed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
held
that
the
regulations
are
valid.
