justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
idea
mr.
urbanczyk
why
the
district
court,
after
having
found
on
the
statutory
grounds
that
the
regulation
wasn’t
authorized,
and
went
to
decide
the
constitutional
questions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bartels,
you
said
that
the
problems
here
are
no
different
than
shea
against
vialpando,
but
we
didn’t
have
the
difficulties
with
the
district
court
order
in
shea
v.
vialpando
that
have
we
have
here,
do
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
risk
of
contempt
that
the
governmental
parties
face
under
the
kind
of
order
the
district
court
entered
here
if
they
misjudge
on
some
of
the
things
the
district
court
talked
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
a
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
was
mrs.
hein
a
full
time
or
a
part
time
student?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
we
know
whether
she
can
represent
both
full
time
or
part
times
students
if
we
don’t
even
know
which
one
she
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
thought
part
time
should
be
treated
differently
from
full
time.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ordinarily,
a
district
court
doesn’t
set
to
decide
matters
on
pure
theory.
they’re
supposed
to
decide
cases
and
controversies
between
concrete
litigant.
