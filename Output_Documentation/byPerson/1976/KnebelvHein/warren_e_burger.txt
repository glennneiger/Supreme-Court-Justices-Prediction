chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
75-1261,
secretary
of
agriculture
against
hein
and
the
related
case.
mr.
urbanczyk,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
employer
of
an
individual
allowed
$50.00
a
month
to
any
employee
in
the
one
city
who
attended
extension
courses
of
the
university
25
miles
away,
and
that
was
the
standard
allowance
to
employees.
would
that
be
treated
by
the
internal
revenue
service
as
income
for
tax
purposes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
not
a
reasonable
analogy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
could
be
quite
different
from
an
automobile
allowance
of
10
cents
a
mile
or
flat
amount
for
the
purposes
for
carrying
on
the
daily
occupation
of
the
employee.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mrs.
williams?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
that
again?
what
page?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
happened
until
the
red
light
goes
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bartels?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[voice
overlap]
send
those
cases
back
to
the
protective
appeal
to
you
or
require
them
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
we
return
to
justice
marshall’s
question
to
you.
the
stipulation
on
page
24
states
that
she
was
allowed
this
amount
of
money
and
that
she
continued
going
to
the
classes,
it
doesn’t
give
any
hint
of
whether
she
actually
spent
it.
if
as
justice
marshall
suggested,
she
got
a
ride
everyday
from
her
classmates
or
a
teacher,
she’d
still
get
the
money
without
having
spending
it.
she’d
still
get
the
allowance,
wouldn’t
she?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
but
the
stipulation
doesn’t
quite
say
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
case
has
already
been
here
once
and
was
sent
back
to
the
same
three
judges
who
have
dealt
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
initiated
the
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
quite
back
way
though,
it
wasn’t
to
find
there
a
stipulation
that
it
was
necessary.
the
stipulation
is
that
it
was
granted
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
determination
of
necessity,
except
by
the
administrative
decision
to
grant
it
which
would
presuppose
that
someone
had
made
the
decision.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
order
to
sustain
your
position
and
the
district
court’s
position,
we
have
to
conclude
that
the
$44.00
that
it
was
either
violation
of
the
statute
or
violation
of
the
constitution
for
the
secretary
to
include
the
$44.00
as
one
of
the
financial
resources
of
this
recipient,
isn’t
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
urbanczyk,
you
have
anything
in
further?
you
have
just
two
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-1261,
knebel,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
against
hein
and
the
related
case
13-55
and
number
75-1267,
bayside
enterprises
against
the
labor
board
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stevens.
