justice

but
isn’t
true
or
have
i
misapprehended
the
situation
mr.
bartels
that
this
is
a
lump
some
monthly
payment
for
which
no
accounting
of
any
kind
need
be
made?
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
secretary
had
said
for
example
that
if
your
client
had
moved
to
the
campus
where
her
only
transportation
was
walking,
she
would
still
get
the
allowance,
you
disagree
with
that?

not

if

district

didn’t
make

did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that’ll
be
some
state
of
nightmare,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bartels,
what
precisely
is
the
statutory
issue?
the
statute
doesn’t
use
the
word
income,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says
well,
except
it
says
--
it
authorizes
the
secretary
to
prescribe
the
amounts
of
household
income
and
other
financial
resources,
including
those
liquid
and
none
liquid
assets
to
be
used
as
criteria
of
eligibility.
it’s
no
more
than
an
authorizing
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
statute
doesn’t
define
the
word
income
is
what
i
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
talking
about
it
as
preamble
or
the
celibacy
2011?
justice
potter
stewart
it
authorizes
the
secretary
then
in
rather
broad
authorizing
language
to
prescribe
the
amounts
of
household
income
and
other
financial
resources?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
precise
statutory
question
then
is
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
act
reports
to
give
him
very
broad
authority
to
--
i
won’t
read
it
again,
prescribe
the
amount
of
income,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
there
cannot
be
any
claim
here
that
the
administrative
definition
of
income
is
contrary
to
some
statutory
definition
of
income
because
the
later
doesn’t
exist
in
this
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
do
you
find
this
conflict?
what
language
of
the
statute
do
you
find
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
secretary’s
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
here
about
food
purchasing
power,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
in
concurrence
of
this
lawsuit,
but
there
is
nothing
and
either
the
statute
or
the
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
for
just
the
2011,
a
food
stamp
program
is
herein
authorized
which
will
permit
low
income
households
to
purchase
a
nutritionally
adequate
diet
through
normal
channels
of
trade.
is
that,
isn’t
it?
and
your
claim
is
that
the
secretary
who
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
2014
expressly
authorized
to
prescribe
these
standards
and
somehow
violated
the
statute.
that
is
your
claim,
that’s
the
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
second
one
is
the
constitutional
issue
which
the
court
has
already
talked
about?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
title
20
is
not
part
of
the
food
stamp
act
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
claim
here,
however,
is
that
the
secretary’s
regulation
violates
the
statute
under
or
is
in
conflict
with
the
statute
under
whose
authority
he
made
the
regulation?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
the
claim
that
violates
some
other
statute
that
did
authorize
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that’s
in
the
2014
(c)?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
the
food
stamp
act.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
class
as
i
understand
it
includes
recipients
of
both
kinds?
justice
potter
stewart
not
all.
