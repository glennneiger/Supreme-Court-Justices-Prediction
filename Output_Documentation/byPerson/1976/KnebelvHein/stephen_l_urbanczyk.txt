mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
appeals
are
taken
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
commissioner
for
the
iowa
state
department
of
social
services
and
an
order
of
the
three-judge
district
court
from
the
southern
district
of
iowa.
that
order
enjoins
on
constitutional
and
statutory
grounds,
parallel
state
and
federal
regulations,
that
have
bearing
upon
the
amount
of
benefits
appellees
may
receive
under
the
food
stamp
act.
we’ve
described
the
operation
of
the
food
stamp
program
in
our
opening
brief.
it
is
necessary
here
only
to
reiterate
that
benefits
are
provided
under
the
food
stamp
program
by
permitting
eligible
households
to
purchase
an
allotment
of
food
stamps
for
less
than
their
face
value
and
that
the
amount
of
the
discount
is
a
function
of
the
household’s
income.
congress
provided
explicitly
that
the
income
of
the
household
was
to
be
the
eligibility
criterion
for
participation
in
the
food
stamp
program,
as
well
as
the
standard
for
determining
what
amount
the
household
is
required
to
pay
for
an
allotment
of
food
stamps.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
household.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
yes,
when
you
[voice
overlap]
yes.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
right.
congress,
however,
left
to
the
secretary
the
task
of
defining
income.
income
is
not
defined
in
the
act.
the
secretary
has
to
find
income
in
regulations
that
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
opening
brief.
this
case
principally
concerns
the
reasonableness
of
one
of
those
regulations,
as
well
as
the
regulation
of
the
state
of
iowa
that
is
similar
since
the
states
are
required
to
conform
their
administration
of
the
food
stamp
program
in
conformity
with
the
secretary
standards.
now,
let
me
describe
the
secretary’s
regulations
briefly
and
explain
how
they
where
applied
to
the
appellee
class
in
this
case.
in
general,
the
secretary
has
provided
that
all
money’s
received
shall
be
included
in
income.
there
are
few
exceptions.
for
example,
for
items
of
income
that
are
none
recurring
or
extraordinary,
but
otherwise,
all
moneys
received
are
generally
included
to
income.
now,
included
within
the
secretary’s
definition
explicitly
are
payments
received
from
federal
assistance
programs
that
where
not
specifically
exempted
by
congress.
appellees
in
this
case
are
individuals
who
receive
such
assistance
in
the
form
of
an
allowance
that
the
state
of
iowa
provides
to
welfare
recipients
that
are
attending
a
work
and
training
program.
that
state
program
is
federally
funded
under
title
20
of
the
social
security
act.
now,
the
regulation
under
which,
the
appellees
receive
this
allowance
provides
for
a
sick
monthly
$60.00
flat
allowance
for
full
time
trainees
and
it
was
$44.00
to
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
instituted.
part
time
trainees
receive
a
somewhat
different
type
of
grant.
they
are
provided
a
travel
allowance
for
actual
expenses
computed
on
a
rate
per
mile
basis
up
to
a
maximum
allowable
amount
to
$45.00
a
month.
these
allowances
like
all
other
forms
of
government
assistance,
not
specifically
exempted
by
congress
were
included
in
the
secretary’s
regulatory
definition
of
income.
the
secretary’s
regulations
also
allowed
the
certain
expenses
are
allowable
as
deductions
from
income.
in
part
pertinent
here,
the
secretary
allows
an
itemized
deduction
for
tuition
and
other
mandatory
educational
fees
and
a
standardized
monthly
10%
deduction
of
all
travel
allowances
or
$30.00
whichever
is
less
to
cover
incidental
expenses.
but
the
secretary
expressly
has
disallowed
an
itemized
deduction
for
the
commutation
or
other
incidental
expenses
incurred
by
one
who
is
attending
school
or
attending
the
training
program.
now,
i
hasten
to
point
out
that
the
secretary
has
not
singled
out
students
or
trainees
or
special
treatment
in
this
regard.
no
individual,
be
a
student,
a
worker
or
whatever
is
allowed
an
itemized
deduction
for
transportation
costs.
indeed,
if
you’ll
take
a
glance
at
the
regulations,
i
think
you
will
conclude
that
ordinary
household
expenses
such
as
transportation
cost
generally
are
not
deductible
under
the
secretary’s
regulations.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
transportation
expenses,
whether
they
are
incurred
by
one
into
trying
to
attend
a
vocational
training
program,
i
think
under
the
secretary’s
regulations
are
not
treated
any
differently
from
transportation
expenses
incurred
by
other
households
in
the
pursuit
of
equally
important
endeavors
like
work
or
some
other.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
tuition
and
travel
i
think
is
a
form
of
expense
incurred
by
students
that
does
not
have
a
counterpart
in
the
ordinary
household
budget.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that’s
correct.
but
i
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
secretary
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
if
you
--
i’m
sorry.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that’s
correct.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that’s
right,
and
i
think
the
whole
point
of
allowing
the
tuition
though
is
that
it
is
a
form
of
expense
incurred
by
students.
it
doesn’t
have
a
counterpart
or
is
not
comparable
to
other
kinds
of
expenses
that
households
ordinarily
incur
such
as
transportation
cost
or
other
forms
of
commuting
to
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i’m
not
sure
mr.
justice
marshall
that
it
--
but
i
understand
what
you
are
getting
out.
i’m
not
sure
that
the
focus
here
is
on
household
expenses.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
it
is
on
household
income.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
it
would
be
included
under
the
secretary’s
regulation
as
income
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
i
think
that
it
does
accord
with
the
common
sense
understanding
of
the
term
income.
those
people
that
receive
a
scholarship
for
example
are
better
off
than
people
who
incur
tuition
expenses,
but
don’t
receive
any
scholarship.
i
think
a
scholarship
for
example,
his
income
in
every
meaningful
sense
of
that
term.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
certainly,
that
would
be
alright
and
the
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
i
don’t
think
so.
unless
there’s
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
when
you
say
credit,
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
i
think
is
that
the
secretary
has
a
uniform
and
general
approach
to
deductions
from
income
as
opposed
to
inclusions
from
income.
i
think
it’s
very
important
that
we
keep
those
two
regulatory
provisions
analytically
distinct
from
one
another.
the
appellees
in
this
case
received
--
all
received
the
training
allowance.
i
think
the
question
then
is
or
initially
is
regardless
of
how
its
spent
is
that
reasonably
included
within
the
income
of
these
recipients.
then,
we
must
confront
the
fact
or
the
reasonable
assumption
since
the
record
is
not
clear
that
the
appellees
spent
some
or
all
of
their
--
of
this
allowance
on
transportation.
and
then
the
question
is
whether
the
secretary
is
required
by
the
act
or
the
constitution
to
permit
an
itemized
deduction
for
such
transportation
costs.
i
think
the
issue
in
this
case
really
focuses
upon
the
second
of
those
two
questions.
as
i
mentioned
in
our
reply
--
as
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief,
i
think
there
is
now
little
or
no
dispute.
i
maybe
wrong
that
the
secretary’s
inclusion
of
this
allowance
was
reasonable.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
inclusion
of
the
allowance,
separate
and
apart
from
how
it
is
spent,
accords
with
the
common
understanding
of
income.
it
is
income
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
those
who
receive
the
allowance
are
better
off
by
its
amount
than
otherwise
similarly
situated
individuals
who
do
not
receive
the
allowance.
indeed,
the
district
court
focused
on
the
deduction
provision,
not
the
inclusion
provision,
and
it
was
the
state
and
federal
regulation
that
denied
a/or
disallowed
and
itemized
deduction
that
was
expressly
invalidated
by
the
court.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
i
don’t
have
a
exact
idea.
i
assume
that
as
the
parties
in
this
case
have
stated
that
the
issues
upon
which
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
issues
turn
are
very
similar
in
this
case.
they
are
interwoven
and
the
whole
concept
of
reasonableness
which
is
the
appropriate
inquiry
in
the
statutory
issue
also
bears
upon
the
constitutional
issue.
but,
i’m
not
exactly
sure
why
the
court
proceeded
on.
what
i
note
in
this
--
in
the
court’s
first
opinion,
the
opinion
that
was
vacated
by
this
court
in
the
first
instance
when
the
federal
regulation
was
amended
expressly
did
not
rely
upon
constitutional
grounds,
but
only
on
the
statutory
ground.
now,
this
lawsuit
as
i
said,
i
think
focuses
upon
the
allowance
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary’s
disallowance
of
an
itemized
deduction.
i
think
the
reasonableness
of
that
regulation
rests
upon
two
general
propositions.
one,
the
disallowance
of
ordinary
expenses
such
as
transportation
costs
is
fully
consistent
with
the
act
and
is
an
effective
and
efficient
method
of
administering
the
food
stamp
program.
the
second
proposition,
assuming
that
that
general
approach
to
transportation
cost
is
reasonable,
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
or
the
constitution
which
requires
the
secretary
to
treat
appellees'
training
costs,
any
differently
from
the
analogous
expenditures
and
other
households.
with
the
first
of
these
propositions,
i
think
we
can
start
with
the
act
itself.
as
i
mentioned,
congress
provided
explicitly
that
it
was
income
that
was
to
determine
the
amount
that
a
household
is
required
to
pay
for
food
stamps.
the
congress
provided
explicitly
that
the
amount
of
the
household
be
required
to
pay
is
a
reasonable
investment,
but
in
no
event
more
than
30%
of
household
income.
now,
that
left
70%
of
household
income
that
the
congress
anticipated
would
be
used
for
the
households
other
non-food
expenses.
and
thus
it
seems
plainly
consistent
as
a
general
matter
for
the
secretary
to
disallow
itemized
deductions
for
non-food
expenses.
i
know
by
the
way
that
the
food
stamp
program
in
this
regard
is
different
from
other
programs
such
as
afdc
for
example,
which
seems
to
be
based
on
actually
available
income.
it’s
not
actually
available
income
that
is
to
key
here
whereas
i
pointed
out
it’s
congress
anticipated
that
much
of
the
income
would
not
be
actually
available
for
food
or
would
be
not
considered
as
part
of
the
--
but
nonetheless
would
be
considered
in
the
secretary’s
determination
of
income.
i
think
an
income
standard
in
addition
to
being
consistent
with
the
act
is
also
an
effective
and
efficient
to
way
of
administering
the
food
stamp
program.
we
have
described
this
at
length
in
our
brief
and
i
use
the
terms
effective
and
efficient
purposely
here
because
those
are
the
exact
terms
that
congress
used
in
instructing
the
secretary
on
how
to
administer
the
food
stamp
program.
an
income
standard,
again
as
we
describe
in
our
brief
is
certainly
more
effective
and
efficient
than
a
standard
which
requires
the
secretary
to
determine
each
month
the
amount
of
food
or
the
amount
of
household
income
actually
available
for
food.
that
is
the
standard
which
requires
the
secretary
to
allow
a
deduction
for
all
expenses
that
reduced
food
purchasing
power
and
it
seems
to
be
the
approach
that
is
implicit
in
much
of
what
district
court
said
in
this
case.
transportation
costs
are
a
prime
candidate
for
disallowance
under
these
general
principles
that
i
have
talked
about.
transportation
costs
are
incurred
by
many
households
in
the
pursuit
of
a
wide
variety
of
endeavors.
at
the
same
time
such
costs
are
--
could
be
reasonably
expected
to
vary
widely
among
households
and
to
depend
to
a
large
extent
on
personal
consumption
choices.
for
these
reasons,
it
seems
especially
appropriate
that
the
--
for
the
secretary
to
simply
let
these
expenses
fall
where
they
lie
and
to
disallow
an
itemized
deduction
for
such
transportation
costs.
appellees
in
their
brief
did
not
appear
to
express
serious
disagreement
with
the
forgoing.
they
do
not
suggest
that
non-food
expenses
generally
or
even
commutation
costs
should
be
deducted
from
household
income.
instead,
the
principle
burden
of
appellees
brief
appears
to
be
that
their
transportation
cost
should
be
treated
differently.
but
as
i
stated
earlier,
i
think
the
second
proposition
under
which
the
reasonableness
of
the
secretary’s
regulation
rests
is
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
and
certainly
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
requires
the
secretary
to
treat
these
transportation
costs
indifferently.
certainly,
a
concept
of
food
purchasing
power
which
so
occupied
the
district
court
in
this
case
does
not
sustain
that
distinction.
appellee
karen
hein,
we
know
from
the
record
traveled
from
muscatine
to
davenport,
iowa
to
attend
a
training
program.
but
certainly,
there
was
nothing
in
the
concept
of
food
purchasing
power
which
required
that
she
--
those
expenses
be
treated
any
differently
than
similarly
situated
individual
who
travels
from
muscatine
to
davenport
because
the
only
job
available
to
them
is
there,
or
a
person
who
travels
from
muscatine
to
davenport
to
attend
a
training
program
without
the
aid
of
an
allowance.
the
district
court,
however,
found
that
the
--
a
subsidiary
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
encourage
education
and
as
an
alternative
ground
of
holding
--
it
held
that
the
regulation
was
invalid
to
that
subsidiary
purpose.
but
in
this
respect,
the
court
read
the
act
for
far
more
than
it
was
worth
in
this
regard.
the
regulation
--
the
provision
that
the
secretary
relies
upon
or
that
the
court
relied
upon
does
nothing
more
than
require
as
a
criterion
for
eligibility
that
able
bodied
individuals
be
either
employed,
be
ready
and
willing
to
find
employment,
to
be
a
mother
or
caretaker
of
children
or
be
a
student.
able
bodied
individuals
in
any
of
those
categories
are
equally
eligible
under
the
food
stamp
program
and
the
act
appears
to
be
neutral
with
respect
to
those
expenses.
there
thus
appears
to
be
nothing
in
that
provision
which
supports
a
favoring
of
transportation,
training
transportation
expenses
over
say
the
training
transportation
--
the
transportation
expenses
of
a
worker.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
they
have
to
give
a
legal
opinion
on
that
--
regarding
that
matters
since
it's
a
while
that
i
took
tax,
but
i
believe
i
would
be,
yes.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
the
secretary’s
definition
of
income
does
resemble
the
tax
code's
definition
of
income.
although,
there
are
some
exemptions
as
i
pointed
out
for
extraordinary
and
non-recurring
items
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
believe
that
is
correct.
yes,
that
would
be
a
specialized
kind
of
expense.
although
i
should
point
out
that
part
time
trainees
under
the
iowa
program
do
receive
an
allowance
designated
as
a
travel
allowance.
it’s
our
position
that,
again,
you
must
analyze
the
inclusion
of
that
allowance
and
the
allowance
for
and
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
deduction
from
that
allowance
as
analytically
separate
questions.
these
regulations
as
we
have
shown
i
think
or
as
we
have
tried
to
show
are
consistent
under
the
act
--
with
the
act
are
reasonable,
and
therefore,
should
be
sustained
under
the
food
stamp
act
as
well
as
the
due
process
clause.
we,
therefore,
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
points.
there
is
some
unclarity
in
the
record
in
this
case.
i
think
that’s
a
hazard
--
perhaps
a
hazard
of
stipulating
and
having
such
a
short
stipulation.
i
think
this
case
has
been
litigated
throughout,
however,
on
the
assumption
that
the
appellee
classes
are
recipients
of
both
a
full
time
allowance
and
a
part
time
allowance,
recipients
of
both
kinds
of
allowances,
and
the
secretary’s
position
with
respect
to
his
regulation
is
that
the
regulation
is
reasonable
with
respect
to
both
kinds
of
allowances.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
that
has
been
the
understanding
as
i
read
it.
with
regard
to
the
stipulation
about
necessary
expenses
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
have
dealt
with
that
in
our
reply
brief,
footnote
on
page
2.
i
do
believe
there
is
some
unclarity
in
the
stipulation
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
believe
the
district
court
read
that
stipulation
as
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
the
district
court
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
necessary.
the
district
court
found
that
appellee
hein
received
this
$44.00
and
all
$44.00
of
it
was
necessary
for
commuting.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
believe
that
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
stipulation.
there
was
no
other
facts
that
i’m
aware
off.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
well,
yes
we
do
accept
that.
however
i
wanted
to
point
it
out
that
the
appellee
class
may
not
be
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
all
the
individuals
--
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
i
believe
that
is
what
they
found
on
the
basis
of
rather
ambiguous
stipulation.
mr.
stephen
l.
urbanczyk
yes
of
course,
yes
we
do.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
would
like
to
point
out
simply
that
we
have
addressed
the
title
20
argument
in
our
reply
brief
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
be
reversed.
thank
you.
