chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-1263,
brewer
against
williams
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
this
unusual
case
today,
the
court
concedes
in
its
opinion
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
just
summarized
that
williams
was
not
threatened
or
coerced
and
that
he
acted
voluntarily
under
his
full
awareness
of
his
constitutional
rights
when
he
guided
the
police
to
the
place
where
he
had
buried
the
body
of
the
murdered
child.
in
the
face
of
this,
the
court
now
holds
that
because
williams
was
prompted
by
a
statement
of
the
detective
not
interrogation
in
the
traditional
sense,
but
a
statement
by
the
detective
that
pricked
his
conscience,
his
disclosure
of
how
and
where
he
buried
the
body
of
the
child
cannot
be
given
to
the
jury.
the
effect
of
this
is
to
fulfill
a
very
grisly
prophecy
made
by
justice
cardozo,
approximately
50
years
ago
that
someday,
some
court
might
carry
what
we
call
the
exclusionary
rule
to
the
absurd
extent
that
its
operative
effect
would
be
to
exclude
the
evidence
relating
to
the
body
of
a
murder
victim
and
--
but
that
would
be
done
because
of
the
means
by
which
it
was
found.
justice
cardozo
then,
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york,
said
this.
"the
criminal
is
to
go
free
because
the
constable
has
blundered.
a
room
is
searched
against
the
law,
and
the
body
of
a
murdered
man
is
found.
and
because
the
privacy
of
the
home
has
been
infringed,
the
murderer
goes
free."
now
here,
as
justice
stewart
has
indicated,
a
new
trial
is
to
be
granted,
but
the
evidence
of
how
the
police
found
the
body
guided
there
by
williams,
the
perpetrator
must
not
be
given
to
the
jury.
in
this
holding,
the
court
regresses
in
my
judgment
to
playing
the
grisly
game
of
hide
and
seek
and
once
more
exalting
the
sporting
theory
of
criminal
justice
which
has
been
fortunately
for
the
american
people
experiencing
some
decline
in
our
jurisprudence.
and
with
justices
white,
blackmun,
and
rehnquist,
i
categorically
reject
the
extraordinary
notion
that
the
police
in
this
case
were
guilty
of
unconstitutional
misconduct,
or
any
conduct
whatever
that
would
justify
the
bizarre
result
reached
by
the
court.
however,
i'd
like
to
focus
primarily,
since
mr.
justice
stewart
has
set
out
the
basic
facts.
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
irrationality
of
applying
the
increasingly
discredited
exclusionary
rule
to
this
particular
case,
this
kind
of
a
case.
in
his
opinion
--
in
his
separate
opinion
in
which
he
concurs
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
the
opinion
of
the
court,
and
the
exclusion
of
this
evidence
of
the
body,
mr.
justice
powell
intimates
that
he
agrees
that
there
is
little
sense
in
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
where
the
evidence
suppressed
is
typically
reliable
and
often
the
most
probative
information
bearing
on
the
guilt
or
the
innocence
of
the
defendant.
and
since
he
seems
to
concede
that
the
evidence
in
question
here
is
highly
reliable
and
probative,
his
joining
the
court's
opinion
can
be
explained
as
i
see
it
only
by
an
insistence
that
the
question
has
not
been
presented
in
the
briefs
and
arguments
submitted
to
us.
it
would
seem
to
me,
if
that
were
the
case,
we
should
set
the
case
for
reargument
or
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
that
aspect
of
the
case.
the
weird
result
reached
by
the
court
today,
and
to
me
there
is
nothing
less
than
that,
recalls
mr.
justice
black's
very
vigorous
dissent
in
kaufman
against
the
united
states
eight
years
ago.
thereto,
a
defendant
sought
release
after
his
conviction
had
been
affirmed
on
appeal
in
the
state
courts.
there,
as
in
this
case,
the
defendant's
guilt
of
the
criminal
act,
was
crystal
clear
and
was
not
called
into
question
by
the
constitutional
claims.
the
court
--
this
court
in
the
kaufman
case
eight
years
ago,
granted
relief
because
it
thought
reliable
evidence
had
been
unconstitutionally
obtained.
mr.
justice
black's
reaction,
foreshadowing
our
long
overdue
holding
of
last
year,
in
stone
against
powell,
written
by
mr.
justice
powell,
serves
as
a
fitting
conclusion
to
the
views
that
i
have
just
expressed.
and
here's
what
mr.
justice
black
had
to
say
on
that
day
in
1968:
“it
is
seemingly
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
to
gain
acceptance
for
the
proposition
that
punishment
of
the
guilty
is
desirable,
other
things
being
equal.
one
commentator,
who
attempted
in
vain
to
dissuade
this
court
from
today's
holding,
thought
it
necessary
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
strong
public
interest
in
convicting
the
guilty.”
indeed,
the
day
may
soon
come
when
the
ever
cautious
law
reviewers
will
actually
be
forced
to
offer
the
timid
and
uncertain
contention,
recently
suggested
satirically
that
crime
may
be
thought
socially
undesirable
and
its
control
thought
to
be
a
valid
governmental
objective
to
which
the
criminal
law
is
rationally
related.
continuing
justice
black's
dissent,
“i
cannot
agree,”
said
he
to
a
rule,
“however
technical
it
may
be
that
leads
to
these
results.
i
would
not
let
any
criminal
conviction
become
invulnerable
to
collateral
attack
where
there
is
left
remaining
the
probability
or
even
the
possibility
that
constitutional
commands
relating
to
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
have
been
violated.
in
such
situation,
society
has
failed
to
perform
its
obligation
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
committed
the
crime.
but
it
is
quite
a
different
thing,
quite
a
different
thing
to
permit
collateral
attack
on
a
state
court
conviction
after
a
trial
according
to
due
process
when
the
defendant
clearly
is,
by
the
proof
and
by
his
own
admissions,
guilty
of
the
crime
charged.
there
may
be
of
course,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
the
thornton
case,
some
special
circumstances
in
which
allowance
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
a
collateral
proceeding
would
be
justified
in
terms
of
the
relevant
and
applicable
constitutional
principles.
some
of
the
situations,
possibly
falling
in
this
category
have
been
enumerated
and
examined
by
others,
and
there
are
circumstances
alleged
here
that
might
lead
to
such
a
disposition
in
this
case,
but
the
court
does
not
rest
its
judgment
on
this
narrow
ground.
and
i
therefore,
this
is
justice
black
speaking,
“do
not
attempt
to
pass
upon
it”.
i
do
contend,
however,
that
the
court
below
was
correct
in
refusing
to
follow
the
broad
rule
that
this
court
is
announcing
today.
in
collateral
attacks
whether
by
habeas
corpus
or
by
section
2255
proceedings,
i
would
always
require
that
the
convicted
defendant
raise
some
kind
of
constitutional
claim
that
cast
a
shadow
of
doubt
on
his
guilt.
this
defendant
here
is
permitted
to
attack
his
conviction
collaterally,
although
he
conceded
at
the
trial
and
does
not
now
deny
that
he
had
robbed
the
bank
and
that
--
and
although
the
evidence
makes
absolutely
clear
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
at
the
time.
thus,
his
guilt
being
certain,
surely,
he
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
get
a
new
trial.
therefore,
justice
black
concluded,
“i
cannot
possibly
agree
with
the
court.”
here,
in
the
case
we've
decided
today,
williams,
in
legal
effect
admitted
the
commission
of
this
murder
by
his
plea
in
the
iowa
state
courts
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
the
jury
in
the
state
court
rejected
that
claim
and
found
him
guilty.
as
of
course
he
was
and
no
member
of
the
court
on
either
--
of
either
view
questions
that
fact
today.
but
because
the
detective
in
the
course
of
the
drive
from
davenport
to
des
moines
made
a
statement
which
pricked
his
conscience,
the
evidence
as
to
how
the
child's
body
was
found
must
be
forever
concealed
from
any
jury
that
may
hear
this
case
in
the
future
if
indeed
the
state
elects
to
proceed.
it
is
often
been
said
the
law
goes
by
trial
and
error
and
perhaps
that's
the
way
it
must
be.
but
in
the
view
of
four
us,
today's
case
is
one
of
those
errors.
appellee
by
the
close
vote
of
trial
before
us
saw
that
only
one
converse
is
needed
to
bring
the
rationality
into
this
area
of
the
law.
