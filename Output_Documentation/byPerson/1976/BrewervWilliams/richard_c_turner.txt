mr.
richard
c.
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court,
i
could
pass
up
to
the
court
some
official
iowa
highway
roadmaps,
which
might
eliminate
the
distances
and
i
have
extra
copies
here.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
when
i
found
out
we
had
only
a
half
hour
to
argue
this,
i
felt
like
the
poor
guy
that
sat
down
in
one
night
near
income
tax
time
to
do
his
income
tax
return
and
reading
the
instructions
that
it
will
only
take
the
average
tax
payer
a
half
hour
and
he
said
to
himself
oh!
my
gosh
it
will
take
me
longer
then
that
to
find
my
wife’s
social
security
number.
but
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very
important
of
course
and
i
think
perhaps
we
should
examine
them
further
and
mr.
winder
said
that
it
was
shortly
out
of
des
moines
that
he
made
this
christian
burial
statement.
it
was
actually,
i
think
he
must
have
spoken
very
shortly
after
leaving
davenport
or
entering
on
to
the
highway.
now,
the
highway
was
is,
even
the
defendant
testified
to
this,
it
was
sleeting,
it
was
cold,
and
the
predictions
for
that
night
were
for
snow
and
he
did
tell
this
man
to
induce
him
and
knowing
i
think
that
he
was
a
religious
man,
and
even
he
even
called
him,
in
the
suppression
hearing,
he
said
he
called
him
reverend.
he
did,
he
wanted
to
induce
the
man
to
tell
him
where
pamela
powers’
body
was
and
in
fact
he
did
not
really
know
that
was
in
mitchellville
area
and
he
did
not
for
that
matter
really
know
that
she
was
dead
for
a
fact.
there
was
anything
really
in
the
record
at
the
that
stage,
but
he
is
suspected
that
she
was
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
fair
characterization
to
say
that
he
really
lied,
but
he
told
him
right
then
and
i
said
i
do
not
want
to
discuss
it
further,
i
want
you
to
answer
me.
now,
as
they
rode
down
the
highway,
it
was
nearly
about
20
miles
from
davenport
to
grinnell.
i
can
exactly
show
on
these
maps.
it
is
on
the
interstate
80,
right
through
iowa
and
the
grinnell
was
a
turnoff
a
few
miles
and
when
they
reached
that
intersection
at
that
point,
mr.
williams
voluntarily
and
spontaneously
volunteered
that
did
you
find
her
shoes
and
they
said,
well,
they
said,
i,
he
knew,
the
officer
knew
that
they
had
found
the
little
girl’s
clothing,
but
he
did
not
know,
or
he
had
not
seen,
he
did
not
know
what
it
consisted
off
and
he
said
that
if
the
shoes
were
with
the
clothing
where
we
found
it.
well,
he
said
pull
in
here
and
he
indicated,
then
they
went
into
a
gas
station
and
they
looked
behind
the
gasoline
station
into
a
box
where
he
said
he
had
disposed
of
a
pair
of
brown
boots
and
they
did
not
find
them.
they
were
never
found.
they
drove
on
then,
continued
on
the
highway
after
having
a
cup
of
coffee
there,
i
think,
they
drove
on
and
a
few
miles
further
they
came
to
rest
stop
and
he
said,
did
you
find
the
blanket,
and
he
said
well,
it
was
with
the
clothes
we
found
it
and
he
said
well
pull
off
here,
i
disposed
the
blanket
in
the
different
place
than
i
put
the
cloths.
so
they
have
drove
in
there
and
they
looked
for
the
blanket,
that
the
blanket
had
been
found.
then
they
drove
on,
the
cloths
have
been
found,
they
drove
on
and
as
they
got
the
mitchellville
which
is
one
of
the
very
first
exits
outside
of
des
moines
and
i
think
this
led
to
officer
leaming’s
theory.
he
theorized
that
i
think
that
and
inferred
he
would,
the
murderer
would
want
to
dispose
the
body
as
quickly
as
possible,
and
that
he
would
turn
off
as
soon
as
he
could.
it
was
not
a
very
first
place
he
could
have
turned
off,
that
was
really
in
des
moines,
but
this
is
a
very
first
place
outside
of
des
moines.
as
they
approached
this
place,
he
said
turn
off
here,
i
will
show
you
where
the
body
is
and
they
did
turn
off
and
he
took
them
up
wrong
road
at
first,
he
was
a
mile
off
on
that,
but
after
a
couple
of
tries
they
went
and
located
the
body
right
where
he
said
it
would
be.
and
he
asked
the
officer
about
the
little
girl’s
face
and
some
things
like
that
that
are
in
the
record.
the
girl’s
body
was
clad
only
in
a
t-shirt,
otherwise
she
was
naked.
she
had
been
sexually
ravaged,
semen
was
found
in
her
vagina,
rectum
and
mouth
and
she
died
of
strangulation
according
to
the
reports.
now,
of
course
when
they
got
back
to
des
moines,
and
then
mr.
mcknight
was
quite
angry,
the
lawyer
was
waiting
there.
indeed
while
it
was
found
by
the
trial
court
in
the
suppression
hearing
by
judge
denaro
who
tried
this
case
as
the
judge
that
there
was
an
agreement.
i
submit
to
you
that
you
will
find
on
a
careful
examination
of
the
record
that
leaming,
neither
leaming
nor
nichols,
nor
any
other
officer
agreed
to
anything.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
i
should
think
not
your
honor.
if
assuming
that
there
was
an
agreement,
it
would
not,
to
me
be
enforceable,
it
would
violate
the
person’s
sense
of
fair
play.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
i
think
too
your
honor
that
you
would
not
treat
it
the
same
way
that
you
would
treat
an
agreement
between
defense
counsel
and
the
prosecuting
attorney.
i
think
those
kinds
of
agreements
should
be
honored,
but
assuming
that
leaming
agreed
which
we
do
not
and…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
your
honor,
perhaps
we
do.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
he
raised
that
in
a
previous
case
and
perhaps…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
he
did.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
your
honor,
i
know
the
rule
on
that
actually
i
think…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
no,
i
do
not
think
you
absolutely
need
to
accept.
the
record
is
complete
and
if
and
i
think
it
is
and
if
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
leaming
or
nichols
or
anyone
agreed
to
anything,
they
urged
this
conversation,
certainly
they
urged
this
one
sided.
now,
from
then
he
found
that
there
was
an
agreement.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
the
federal
district
court
did
so,
on
the
basis
that
it
was
bound
by
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
they
too
found
that
there
was
an
agreement,
i
believe.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
that
is
correct,
but
i
stand
here
--
that
is
true.
i
plead
with
the
court
to
consider
the
record
itself
on
this
point
and
i
think
that
section
2254
has
authority,
and
therefore,
this
court
to
do
that,
where
there
was
an
absence
of
this.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
your
honor,
officer
leaming
testified
and
he
was
un-contradicted
that
he
did
not
really
ask
any
questions.
he
made
this
christian
burial
statement
and
he
said
i
do
not
want
you
to
answer
me.
now
that
may
be
considered
to
be
that
is
going
to
be
your
question
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
that
constituted
interrogation
or
a
psychological
ploy.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
he
was
and
he
made
a
statement
for
that
purpose.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
it
was
not
interrogation
in
the
customary
sense
of
thinking
of
interrogation
has
been
questioning.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
he
had
not
asked
him
a
question.
he
simply
stated
the
fact.
he
said
i
want
you
to
observe
the
weather
conditions.
i
want
you
to
notice
that
its
snow,
that
it
is
sleeting,
the
roads
are
icy
and
so
on
and
he
said
i
think
that
the
even
if
the
snow
covers
her
body,
you
would
not
be
able
to
find
her
body
and
her
parents
deserve
did
a
christian
burial.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
it
is,
but
it
was
very
brief.
we
claim
there
was
no
agreement
not
to
do
it,
but
even
if
there
was,
he
was
not
bound
by
any
such
agreement,
really
as
an
officer
of
law;
he
is
a
police
officer
anyway.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
this
was
volunteered
two
hours
later.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
so
matter
of
ethics,
he
would
be
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
that
it
was…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
i
think
the
court’s
attach
it.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
perhaps,
because
yes…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
in
a
plea
bargain,
for
example
the
courts
have
held
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
bound
and
later
set
aside
his
agreement
and
i
think
yes,
but
not;
the
law
has
never
extended
to
a
police
officer
in
this
regard.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
i
have
not
conceded
there
was
an
agreement,
but
even
though
you
have
a
lawyer,
you
say
that
this
is
your
life
to
the
lawyer
even
a
trial,
the
court
has
held
that
in
the
faretta
case.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
i
think
he
did.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
as
he
drove
down,
as
he
approached
grinnell.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
in
the
first
place
he
called
mr.
mcknight.
he
invoked
his
right
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
no,
and
it
is
no
required
under
the
cases.
there
is
no
requirement
of
an
express
waiver.
i
think
the
brown…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
there
is
another
dispute
in
fact
is
to
whether
that
mr.
kelly
asked…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
it
is
disputed
your
honor.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
it
is
disputed
and
the
trial
judge
did
not
make
any
finding
on
that
point
of
lawyer.
the
trial
judge
did
not
find,
the
judge
denaro
did
not
find…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
you
mean
to
go
along,
to
ride
along
in
the
car.
there
are
had
not
been
any
agreement
that
he
ride
along
in
the
car.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
it
is
disputed
whether
he
was
asked
steven
to
ride
--
was
he
not
asked
to
right
along
in
the
car.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir.
well,
judge
hanson
placed
great
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
kelly
asked
to
ride
along
and
was
not
allowed
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
he
never
said,
expressly
said
that
i
waive.
he
merely
volunteered…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes,
i
think
it
is.
it
is
a
waiver
and
his
fifth
amendment
rights
as
well.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
when
he
directed
the
officers
to
go
to
look
for
the
shoes,
he
waived
his
right
to
counsel
while
going
to
look
for
the
shoes
and
he
did
the
same
thing
when
he
went
to
look
for
the
blanket
and
again
when
he
went
to
look
for
the
body.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
when
he
got
to
des
moines.
you
see
he
started
off.
he
knew
his
rights.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yeah,
perhaps,
he
knew
his
rights.
he
called
his
lawyer
to
start
with
and
he
also
sought
out
and
got
mr.
kelly
and
he
had
a
lawyer
in
fact,
but
he
did
not
talk
to
mr.
kelly
once
but
he
talked
to
him
twice
and
both
of
his
lawyers
warned
him,
do
not
talk
to
the
officers,
do
not
tell
them
anything.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that,
but
nevertheless
he
did,
and
i
say
that
he
had
that
right
and
he
did
not
have
to
stop
and
say,
now
there
is
something
i
want
you
gentlemen
to
know.
i
am
going
to
temporarily
waive
my
right
to
counsel,
that
is
absurd,
he
does
not
have
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes,
i
think
he
does,
and
in
fact,
i
think
the
cases
hold
that
no
express
statement
of
the
waiver
is
required
that
he
can
simply
waive
it
by
proceeding
and
without
his
counsel.
a
waiver
is
simply
a
knowledgeable
relinquishment
of
a
known
right.
that
has
been
held
by
this
court
and
that
is
what
he
did.
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
and
he
knew
that
right
and
he
waived
that
right.
well,
of
course
--
i
might
need
--
mr.
richard
c.
turner
i
think
he
waived
both
at
that
point,
because
he
had
already
had
a
lawyer.
he
waived
both
his
right
not
to
speak
and
his
right
to
counsel,
both
which
rights
he
knew,
no
question
about
it,
he
admitted
he
knew
them.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
in
escobedo
in
the
first
place,
i
think
there
were
no
warnings.
escobedo
was
asking
to
see
his
lawyer,
but
was
denied
to
right
to
see
his
lawyer.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
but
in
this
case
he…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
the
finding
was
that
he
had
said
that
he
would
wait
and
tell
them
the
whole
story
when
he
got
to
des
moines
and
talk
to
his
lawyer.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
i
think
i
can,
yes
because
in
the
escobedo
case
even
or
in
any
case,
the
lawyer
has
no
right
to
ride
along
or
to
get
into
the
jail
cell
or
anything.
the
client
has
right
at
appropriate
times
to
talk
to
his
lawyer,
but
that
does
not
mean
the
lawyer
has
to
live
within,
and
in
this
case
it
did
not
mean
when
he
said,
when
i
get
to
des
moines,
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story,
that
he
would
not
talk
in
absence
of
his
attorney.
that
is
what
judge
hanson,
the
federal
court
determined
that
he
meant
by
saying
that
he
would
not
talk
in
absence
of
his
attorney,
but
that
is
what
he
said,
he
said
when
i
get
to
des
moines,
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
yes
sir,
i
think
it
would.
in
the
stone
against
powell,
that
was
a
fourth
amendment
case
in
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
burger
noted
that
there
was
a
strong
circumstantial
probability
or
reliability
between
you
find
the
goods
or
the
body
or
something
in
a
search
and
here
there
is
a
strong
circumstantial
probability
or
reliability
in
his
statement,
in
the
honesty
and
the
truth
of
his
statement,
when
he
took
the
police
to
the
body
and
i
think
here
where
there
has
been
a
full
hearing
and
these
rights
have
been
adjudicated
by
the
trial
court,
that
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
are
at
least
in
the
equally
as
good
position
to
make
the
decision
as
would
be
judge
hanson
or
would
be
the
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
that
therefore,
the
stone
versus
powell
should
be
extended
here
and
that
this
case
should
be
denied
on
that
ground
alone,
but
then
of
course
we
ask
here
that
the
court
overturned
its
decisions
in
the
miranda
case
that
you
cannot
use
psychological
ploys
or
subtle
interrogation
or
cajolery.
we
think
that
the
historical
basis
of
the
miranda
case
and
the
area
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
not
that
type
of
conduct.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
no,
i
think
i
reply
brief
handles
that.
that
is
a
big
yoke
that
you
put
and
further
he
did
not
raise
that
in
the
challenging
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
or
resisting
it
anyway.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
we
contend
that
we
have
challenged
that
your
honor
throughout
our
argument
on
miranda
and…
mr.
richard
c.
turner
repeatedly
through
our
argument
we
say
that
his
statements
were
voluntary,
there
is
no
evidence.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
well,
your
honor
i
can
say
the
case
is
indicated
that
this
court
can
and
that
type
of
situation
where
these
questions
are
the
very
foundation
of
the
whole
matter
consider
those
things,
even
know
they
were
not
specifically
raised
and
we
have
cases
cited
in
our
brief
to
that
effect.
mr.
richard
c.
turner
not
at
the
moment,
but
i
think
we
have
fully
answered
it
on
three
different
aspects.
