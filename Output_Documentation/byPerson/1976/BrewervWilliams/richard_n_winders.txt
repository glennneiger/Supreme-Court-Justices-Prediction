mr.
richard
n.
winders
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
richard
winders.
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
iowa.
this
case
involves
the
kidnap
and
rape
and
murder
of
a
10-year-old
girl
in
des
moines,
iowa.
the
questions
that
will
be
presented,
concern
whether
or
not
the
respondent
williams
was
deprived
of
his
constitutional
rights
when
he
was
transported
by
police
officers
from
davenport,
iowa
to
des
moines,
iowa.
during
that
trip
williams
made
self
incriminating
statements
and
ultimately
led
the
police
to
the
body
of
the
little
girl.
williams
was
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
by
a
jury
verdict
in
polk
county,
iowa.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
a
five
to
four
decision.
williams
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
of
iowa,
that
petition
was
sustained
by
the
federal
district
court
judge
hanson.
we
appealed
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
in
two
to
one
decision,
justice
webster
dissenting;
judge
hanson’s
opinion
was
affirmed.
our
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied
although
three
justices
had
voted
to
hear
it.
in
1968,
on
the
day
before
christmas,
pamela
powers
accompanied
her
mother
to
the
ymca
in
des
moines
to
watch
her
brother
participate
in
a
wrestling
match.
they
arrived
about
noon.
pamela
got
some
candy
and
then
remembered
that
she
should
wash
her
hands
and
asked
her
mother,
if
she
should
go
to
the
washroom.
her
mother
gave
her
that
permission.
pamela
left,
she
never
returned
and
was
never
seen
alive
again.
the
respondent
williams
was
a
resident
of
the
ymca
and
about
1:00
or
1:30,
he
was
seen
hurrying
through
the
lobby
of
the
y
carrying
a
large
bundle
wrapped
in
a
blanket.
he
got
outside
and
asked
a
young
boy
if
the
boy
would
open
the
car
door
for
him.
the
boy
did,
williams
threw
the
bundle
inside
and
the
boy
testified
at
trial
there
were
two
skinny
white
legs
in
it.
ymca
personnel
tried
to
stop
williams,
but
he
pushed
them
aside
and
locked
doors
at
the
car
and
drove
away.
two
days
later
on
the
morning
of
the
26th
of
december,
henry
mcknight,
a
lawyer
in
des
moines
came
to
the
des
moines
police
station
and
advised
officers
there
that
mr.
williams
had
phoned
him
from
moline,
illinois
and
mr.
mcknight
said
that
he
advised
williams
to
surrender
in
davenport,
iowa
which
is
just
across
the
river.
williams
did
surrender
in
davenport
at
approximately
9
o’clock.
he
was
arrested
and
given
his
miranda
warnings
by
a
lieutenant
ackerman.
he
telephoned
mcknight
who
was
in
des
moines
police
station
and
mcknight’s
end
of
the
conversation
with
williams
was
overheard
by
chief
of
police
nichols
and
also
officer
claudius
leaming.
mcknight
told
williams
among
other
things
that
des
moines
police
officers
would
come
and
pick
him
up,
that
they
would
not
grill
him,
they
would
be
nice
to
him
and
they
let
no
harm
to
him
and
they
would
talk
it
over
in
des
moines.
they
further
told
williams
that
you
have
to
tell
the
police
where
the
body
is,
you
are
going
to
have
to
tell
them.
he
ended
this
conversation
by
saying,
well,
it
makes
no
difference.
you
come
back
to
des
moines,
tell
me,
i
will
tell
them,
i
am
going
to
tell
them
the
whole
story.
judge
zinato
(ph)
of
the
polk
county
district
court
in
a
suppression
hearing
found
that
from
that
conversation
that
there
was
an
agreement
existing
between
the
police
and
mr.
mcknight
that
no
questions
would
be
asked
of
williams
on
his
way
back
to
des
moines.
he
found
this
even
know
both
chief
of
police
nichols
and
officer
leaming
denied
the
existence
of
the
agreement.
leaming
and
officer
nelson
went
to
davenport
to
pick
up
williams.
they
arrived
around
noon.
in
the
meantime,
williams
had
been
taken
before
a
municipal
court
judge
arraigned
in
a
fugitive
warrant
and
for
the
second
time
given
the
miranda
warnings
by
the
judge.
he
was
also
granted
a
private
conversation
with
the
judge
in
chambers.
as
he
was
leaving,
he
noticed
individual
in
the
courtroom
and
asked
if
the
man
was
a
lawyer.
it
was
a
thomas
kelly
from
davenport
and
williams
was
allowed
to
talk
to
him
in
private
for
about
40
minutes.
leaming
first
saw
williams
at
approximately
1
o’clock
on
that
day.
he
for
the
third
and
last
time
gave
williams
the
miranda
warnings.
he
also
stated
to
williams,
now
i
want
you
to
understand
that
you
are
represented
by
mr.
kelly
here
in
davenport
and
by
mr.
mcknight
in
des
moines.
williams
acknowledged
that
he
understood
that.
leaming
further
stated
that
i
want
you
to
remember
what
i
have
told
you
here
because
we
will
be
visiting
on
the
way
back
to
des
moines.
they
left
about
2
o’clock.
leaming
testified
both
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
trial
that
shortly
after
they
left,
williams
started
asking
him
questions.
he
asked
about
the
police
procedures
whether
they
had
searched
for
fingerprints
in
his
room,
whether
they
had
searched
friends
of
his.
they
also
had
further
discussion
pertaining
to
religion,
church
groups
singing
in
that
type
of
thing.
leaming
testified
further
that
he
made
a
statement
to
williams
shortly
after
they
got
on
a
freeway
outside
of
des
moines.
he
stated
to
him,
i
want
you
to
observe
the
weather
conditions.
it
is
raining
and
freezing,
it
is
going
to
snow
tonight.
you
yourself
are
the
only
person
that
knows
where
this
little
girl’s
body
is,
and
you
have
only
been
there
once.
i
think
we
will
be
going
right
by
the
area
where
the
body
is.
i
feel
that
we
should
stop
and
locate
the
body
on
the
way
to
des
moines
rather
then
waiting
and
coming
back
because
you
may
not
be
able
to
find
it.
the
parents
of
this
little
girl
deserve
a
christian
burial
for
the
girl
that
was
snatched
away
from
them.
williams
asked
him
why
he
felt
they
would
be
going
by
the
area
and
leaming
replied
to
him,
i
know
it
is
in
mitchellville
area,
i
do
not
know
where,
but
i
know
it
is
there.
leaming
ended
this
conversation
by
telling
williams,
i
do
not
want
you
to
answer
me.
i
do
not
want
to
discuss
it
any
further.
just
think
about
it
as
riding
down
the
railroad.
williams
further
stated
to
leaming
and
according
to
leaming
that
also
for
the
first
time,
shortly
after
leaving
davenport
on
the
freeway
that
williams
told
him
when
i
get
to
des
moines
and
see
mr.
mcknight,
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
whole
story.
they
proceeded
on
interstate
and
shortly
before
they
got
to
grinnell
ascent,
william
spontaneously
volunteered
a
question
to
leaming,
where
did
you
find
the
little
girl’s
shoes.
mr.
richard
n.
winders
your
honor,
it
is
approximately
163
miles.
mr.
richard
n.
winders
grinnell
is
approximately
60
miles
from
des
moines,
so
it
would
be
roughly
a
110-120
miles.
mr.
richard
n.
winders
your
honor,
the
testimony
is
conflicting.
williams
or
leaming
stated
that
he
had
a
theory
if
the
body
was
in
the
mitchellville
area
and
williams
at
the
suppression
hearing
also
stated
that,
so
he
had
been
told
by
leaming
that
they
speculated
the
body
was
in
the
mitchellville
area.
so
it
was
not
exactly
a
lie.
it
was
more
of
a
theory.
mr.
richard
n.
winders
well,
he
did
not
absolutely
know.
no,
only
williams…
mr.
richard
n.
winders
well,
he
did
not
know
for
sure
absolutely.
it
was
his
theory
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
winders
well,
your
honor,
we
would
not
call
an
interrogation
but
we
do
concede
and
the
testimony
has
fairly
certain
that
leaming
wanted
to
find
and
locate
the
little
girl
before
they
got
to
des
moines
and
midnight,
he
stated
of
that.
mr.
richard
n.
winders
i
think
you
could
say
that
and
it
is
the
same
thing,
i
think,
your
honor.
after
they
searched
for
the
shoes…
mr.
richard
n.
winders
alright,
your
honor,
thank
you.
i
will
then
surrender
my
position
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
iowa,
mr.
richard
c.
turner.
thank
you.
