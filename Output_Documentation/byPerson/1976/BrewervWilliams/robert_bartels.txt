mr.
robert
bartels
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
briefs
in
this
case
indicate,
there
are
a
number
of
constitutional
problems
that
are
raised
by
the
record,
and
i
would
like
to
focus
on
what
is
the
central
and
most
serious
problem,
i
think
the
one
that
court
has
been
dealing
with
so
far
primarily,
and
that
is
the
deliberate
and
repeated
efforts
by
the
des
moines
police
officers
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
the
assistance
of
this
counsel
during
an
interrogation
about
the
crime,
the
very
crime
with
which
had
been
charged,
formally
charged.
now,
this
interrogation
took
place
as
mr.
turner
and
mr.
winders
have
indicated
on
the
automobile
trip
from
davenport
to
des
moines.
i
think
perhaps
i
ought
to
come
back
and
emphasize
certain
facts
that
existed
and
that
everyone
knew
before
the
automobile
trip
begin
and
before
the
interrogation
took
place.
first,
the
police
fairly
knew
that
the
defendant
had
retained
an
attorney,
mr.
mcknight
to
represent
him
with
regard
to
the
charges
he
was
facing
and
indeed
that
mr.
mcknight
had
himself
arranged
to
have
the
defendant
surrender
in
davenport.
secondly,
the
police
had
been
informed
through
counsel
that
the
defendant
did
not
wish
to
be
questioned
or
to
provide
any
information
during
the
return
trip
to
des
moines.
third…
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor
though
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances
in
which
the
defendant
could
clearly
state
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
about
that,
where
that
he
was
rejecting
his
attorney’s
advice
about
that,
but
there
is
nothing
even
remotely
resembling
that
in
this.
mr.
robert
bartels
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
guess
that
brings
me
to
the
agreement.
the
agreement
that
the
state
trial
court
and
judge
hanson
both
found
existed
between
the
defense
counsel,
mr.
mcknight
and
the
police
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
questioned
during
this
return
trip
to
des
moines.
now,
there
is
clearly
a
considerable
amount
of
support
in
the
record
for
the
trial
courts
findings,
particularly
on
pages
3
(a)
and
39
of
the
appendix,
the
testimony
of
chief
nichols,
effectually
concedes
that
there
was
an
agreement.
at
one
point,
on
page
39,
mr.
mcknight
says,
now
did
not
you
say
when
we
found
out
and
they
had
stopped
to
find
the
body
that
you
hoped
that
they
had
not
questioned
him
and
had
not
stopped
to
find
the
body
because
we
agreed
that
would
not
be
done,
and
chief
nichol
says,
i
may
have
said
that.
and
detective
leaming
denies
the
agreement,
but
there
your
honor
the
trial
court
specifically
expressed
doubts
about
detective
leaming’s
candor
with
regard
to
the
agreement.
i
think
it
is
important
here
to
remember
that
the
state
trial
court
got
to
see
the
demeanor,
both
of
the
witnesses
and
mr.
mcknight
was
in
a
peculiar
position.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor
i
do
not
think
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
really
made
any
finding
either
way
on
that,
really
relying
on
the
finding
of
the
state
trial
court,
which
i
guess
is
the
finding
really
that
is
referred
to
in
section
2254
(d),
that
is
the
finding
on
merits
of
a
factual
dispute
that
has
the
initial
presumption
of
correctness
under
2254
(d).
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
clearly
the
and
it
is
my
view
is
that
the
client
is
the
master
and
that
the
attorney
is
the
servant.
so,
here
your
honor,
the
defendant
has
retained
the
counsel
to
represent
him
and
to
assist
him
in
dealing
with
the
police.
now,
there
is
no
contention
here
that
there
was
a
commercial
contract.
there
is
no
issue
of
margin
but
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
not
perfectly
clear
what
the
judge
denaro
meant
by
an
agreement.
i
think
he
at
least
meant
a
mutual
understanding
between
the
parties
and
i
think
mutually
understood
that
the
other
party
was
essentially
agreeing
to
this,
that
there
would
be
no
questioning.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
he
could
have
done
that
your
honor,
but
he
clearly…
mr.
robert
bartels
hypothetically
your
honor,
what
could
have
happened
in
this
trip
is
that
the
defendant
could
have
said
mr.
leaming,
i
want
to
reject
everything
my
lawyer
has
done.
i
want
to
reject
that
agreement.
i
want
to
give
up
the
assistance
of
counsel.
i
want
to
talk
to
you
and
nothing
even
remotely
resembling
that
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
if
that
had
taken
place
before
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
christian
burial
speech
and
a
priest
then
i
think
there
still
would
be
no
problem
in
this
case,
except
perhaps
the
fact
that
mr.
kelly
was
denied
permission
to
go
long
in
the
squad
car
and
i
think
that
was
probably
proper
also
as
long
as
the
police
were
not
going
to
interrogate
while
mr.
kelly
was
not
in
the
police
car.
mr.
robert
bartels
i
assume
i
would
not
your
honor,
no.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
problem
with
that.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes,
your
honor,
the
most
important
piece
of
interrogation
here
is
the
christian
burial
speech
and
i
think
mr.
turner
has
conceded
really
that
it
was
an
obvious
attempt
to
induce
the
defendant
to
provide
this
information
and
it
is
also
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
i
guess
the
reason
he
succeeded.
the
information
that
was
requested
was
in
fact
given.
the
delay
which
the
attorney
general
tries
to
make
something
of
was
exactly
what
detective
leaming
asked
for.
there
was
no
information
given
before
the
christian
burial
speech
despite
all
the
other
conversation
that
is
referred
too.
no
information
given
after
the
defendant
returns
to
des
moines
and
sees
mr.
mcknight.
mr.
robert
bartels
i
know
for
one
thing
it
is
an
interrogation
and
beyond
being
interrogation,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
a
particularly
offensive
in
course
type
of
interrogation
because
obviously
the
references
the
christian
burial
were
designed
to
play
on
the
defendant’s
known
religious
background
and
this
history
no
long.
mr.
robert
bartels
wrong
with
playing
on
it?
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
what
detective
leaming
did
and
the
way
in
which
he
made
that
christian
burial
speech
was
psychologically
coerced
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
past
that
there
could
be
such
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
detective
leaming
was
trying
to
play
on
the
defendant’s
psychological
weakness
to
make
him
do
something
that
he
would
not
have
done
under
any
just
ordinary
question
and
answering
the
case
and
that
to
play
on
those
kinds
of
weaknesses
amounts
to
psychological
coercion.
if
there
is
anything
besides
physical
coercion
then
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
the
case.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
doubt
it,
and
i
think
there
are
might
have
been,
there
had
to
be
some
further
enquiry
then
by
the
trial
courts,
both
federal
and
state,
in
terms
of
whether
that
question
was
somehow
connected
to
the
christian
burial
speech,
but
i
think
on
this
record,
we
really
do
not
know
that
and
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
conceded
that
that
statement
alone
could
have
been
admissible.
that
is
not
what
we
were
talking
about
here.
we
are
talking
about
the
other
information
that
was
provided
as
result
of
the
christian
burial
speech
and
the
other
questioning
that
is
in
place.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
have
been
probably
admissible
as
barely
relevant
on
the
issue
of
whether…
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
it
were
not
incriminating,
it
would
be
relevant
so
my
answer
is
yes
because
i
think
it
might
be
regarded
that
somewhat
incriminating.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
someone
might
make
something
out
of
this
question
about
the
shoes.
on
the
other
hand
there
are
a
number
of
–
i
think
that
can
also
be
explained
as
a
curiosity
in
that
warning
to
know
what
evidence
has
been
found.
now,
admittedly,
your
honor,
it
could
be
relevant
and
it
would
be
something
that
the
prosecutor
could
use.
i
can
only
say
as
a
prosecutor
that
i
would
far
rather
have
the
fact
that
the
defendant
showed
the
location
of
the
body
and
knew
the
location
of
the
shoes.
mr.
robert
bartels
i
think
the
question
here
is
whether
the
admission
of
the
other
statements
about
the
location,
the
body
was
harmless
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
doubt
that.
one
thing
that
happened
that
tends
to
get
lost
in
the
attorney
general’s
description
is
that
is
that
there
was
questioning
about
that.
it
was
not
simply
a
conversation
and
a
statement.
after
the
initial
question
about
the
shoes,
detective
leaming
and
detective
nelson
who
is
the
other
individual
in
the
car
made
some
statements
about
how
they
did
not
know
whether
the
shoes
have
been
found
and
some
evidence
had
been
found,
but
they
did
know
exactly
what
and
then
they
said
did
you
put
the
shoes
with
the
other
stuff
and
he
said
no,
i
put
them
in
a
gas-station
and
then
they
asked,
what
kind
of
shoes
were
they,
were
they
go-go
boots
and
again
there
was
response.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
further
interrogation,
yes.
your
honor
in
addition
of
this
agreement
perhaps
i
clarify
some
more.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
in
essence,
not
because
of
the
$1000.
i
think
what
is
crucial
about
the
agreement
here,
your
honor,
is
that
mr.
mcknight
was
led,
misled
into
not
doing
other
things
he
could
have
done
to
further
protect
the
defendant’s
rights,
like,
ask
to
go
along
in
the
police
car,
like
inform
the
defendant
in
much
more
detail
about
his
rights
and
about
the
crucial
importance
in
terms
of
the
admissibility
of
evidence
at
trial
that
he
not
disclose
the
body,
the
location
of
the
body
directly
to
the
police
officers,
rather
than
through
counsel,
as
obviously
was
mr.
mcknight’s
intent.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor
let
me
clarify.
i
think
it
is
enforceable
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
that
if
any
interrogation
takes
place
during
that
time,
that
it
is
improper,
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
the
$1000
is
clearly
improper,
but
it
has
no
bearing
on
that.
mr.
robert
bartels
you
are
right,
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
defendant
has
the
right
of
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
one
of
the
kinds
of
assistance
that
counsel
can
give
is
to
make
agreements
of
this
sort
with
the
prosecutor
and
this
kind
of
agreement
is
likely
to
change
the
course
of
conduct
by
the
defense
counsel
in
terms
of
what
else
he
would
have
done
to
protect
those
rights
in
the
absence
of
these.
mr.
robert
bartels
i
think
that
is
true
characterization,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
he
was
told
it
was
impossible,
your
honor,
and…
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that.
i
am
not
quite
sure
why
in
these
circumstances…
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
we
are
not
against
saying
that
mr.
kelly
had
an
enforceable
right
to
be
in
the
car.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
i
think
the
point
of
it
your
honor
is
that
when
the
police
were
going
to
have
the
defendant
isolated
from
his
counsel
in
that
way
for
whatever
reasons,
that
they
were
then
required
not
to
question,
not
only
because
of
the
agreement
but
because
of
the
other
indications
that
the
defendant
should
not
be
questioned
or
provide
information
in
the
absence
of
his
attorney.
your
honor,
we
could
pretend
mr.
kelly
did
not
even
exist
in
the
case,
and
the
case
would
have
to
go
the
same
way,
it
is
simply
a
factor.
now,
any
of
these
factors
are,
i
guess,
i
have
neglected
to
talk
about,
although
the
attorney
general
has
several
statements
by
the
defendant
that
he
would
tell
the
whole
story
after
and
mr.
turner,
i
think
inadvertently
left
out
the
fact
after
he
saw
mr.
mcknight,
in
des
moines,
not
just
after
he
got
back
to
des
moines,
there
is
clearly
a
reference
to
counsel
on
those
statements
and
in
detective
leaming’s
on
testimony.
now,
any
of
the
facts
that
i
have
discussed
so
far,
taken
individually
would
have
constitutionally
precluded
detective
leaming
from
engaging
in
the
interrogation
that
took
place
here.
in
the
face
of
all
of
them,
he
did
engage
in
these
efforts
to
obtain
information
and
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
getting
it,
before
the
defendant
could
reach
mcknight;
he
concedes
that
was
his
purpose.
that
kind
of
purposeful
attempt
to
obtain
information,
given
all
his
background
about
the
agreement,
the
other
indications
that
there
should
be
no
questioning,
the
fact
that
defendant
had
counsel
with
regard
to
a
crime
with
which
he
had
been
charged.
that
purposeful
interrogation
in
light
of
all
those
facts
clearly
is
a
violation
of
the
defendant’s
right
to
counsel
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
and
that
is
quite
apart
for
any
considerations
of
miranda
versus
arizona
here.
even
if
the
case
did
not
exist,
we
would
still
have
the
same
result.
now,
at
the
same
time
it
is
true
that
miranda
provides
an
alternative
basis.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
eighth
circuit's
decision
also
rested
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
if
i
recall
it
correct.
mr.
robert
bartels
yes,
your
honor,
and
clearly
the
district
court’s
decision
rested
on
several
grounds.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
deal
with
the
voluntaryness
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor,
it
simply
affirmed
and
its
discussion
of
the
grounds
for
affirmance
did
not
include
any
discussion
of
voluntariness.
i
think
the
meaning
of
that
is
the
district
court’s
decision
on
that
stood
and
it
still
stands.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
eighth
circuit
was
faced
with
choice
of
several
equal
theories,
any
one
or
two
or
three
of
which
it
could
have
discussed
and
there
was
really
nothing
about
any
of
them
that
said
that
this
issue
or
that
issue
should
be
the
one
that
we
rely
on
primarily.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
might
primarily
on
the
sixth
amendment
and
miranda,
browns
and
i
gather,
they
simply
decided
that
it
was
not
really
necessary
to
also
make
the
alternative
finding
of
voluntary.
mr.
robert
bartels
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
in
the
dissent,
your
honor,
it
is
raised
and
then
challenged
at
that
point,
and
i
think
that
reflects
the
fact
that
it
was
litigated
and
considered.
now,
under
the
miranda
case,
i
am
going
to
touch
on
this
very
briefly,
there
is
also
clearly…
mr.
robert
bartels
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it…
mr.
robert
bartels
that
is
correct
your
honor.
everything
i
have
said,
i
think
about
the
facts
also
relates
to
the
miranda
claim,
but
clearly
there
is
the
violation
here
quite
apart
from
miranda
or
escobedo.
now,
under
miranda,
again,
there
is
alternative
ground
and
i
think,
in
fact,
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
under
miranda
probably
the
most
important
way
here
is
that
since
the
defendant
himself
and
through
counsel
indicated
rather
clearly
that
he
did
not
wish
to
make
any
statements
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
miranda
says,
interrogation
must
cease,
per
se
rule.
i
think
this
court’s
opinions
in
michigan
versus
mosley
clarified
that
and
reaffirmed
that
distinction
between
invocations
of
a
desire
to
have
a
lawyer
and
invocations
of
the
right
to
remain
silent.
so
that
there
is
no
question
here
about
some
time
passing
after
that
and
being
able
to
re-interrogate
after
a
certain
point
of
time,
even
under
the
right
to
remain
silent
rubric
as
i
read
(inaudible)
your
honor,
there
was
a
clear
length
of
time
during
which
the
right
to
remain
silent
had
been
invoked,
it
was
about
the
same
crime
and
that
the
mosley
analysis
on
that
point
also
would
not
apply
to
this
case,
but
the
counsel
point
is
still
much
clearer.
your
honor,
i
think
i
also
want
to
make
some
statements
about
waiver
here.
i
think
the
state’s
primary
defense
really
here
is
that
somehow
there
was
a
waiver
and
what
mr.
turner
has
a
relied
upon
here,
first
of
all
is
the
question,
did
you
find
the
shoes
and
secondly
the
fact
that
the
defendant
provided
information.
your
honor
neither
of
those
statements
in
anyway
can
be
said
to
be
an
indication
that
i
want
to
waive
my
lawyer.
there
is
not
even
an
inference
to
be
drawn
there
from
the
statement.
mr.
robert
bartels
that
is
right,
your
honor,
i
think
the
second
problem
with
the
state’s
view
here
is
supposedly
the
statements
come
after
the
defendants’
right
not
to
be
questioned
in
the
absence
of
his
lawyer
has
already
occurred,
and
surely
your
honor,
the
waiver
has
to
precede
the
violation
in
order
to
take
care
of
it.
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
it
stems
both
from
miranda
and
from
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
have
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
during
this
kind
of
critical
stage
after
a
charge
has
been
filed.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
bartels
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
i
thought
i
perhaps
should
address
a
question
that
was
raised
by
justice
blackmun
during
my
opponent’s
argument
that
is
your
applicability
of
the
stone
and
rice
cases
to
this
particular
case.
i
think
the
simplest
answer
to
the
question
is
that,
that
issue
has
never
been
raised
here.
it
was
never
raised
below.
it
was
not
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
was
not
addressed
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
on
the
merits
and
it
was
not
even
--
mr.
robert
bartels
your
honor,
i
think
the
issue
could
have
been
raised
as
it
was
by
the
litigant’s
stand
in
the
stone
case,
but
more
significantly,
i
think
your
honor,
that
even
in
the
reply
brief
that
was
filed
last
week,
there
is
simply
no
mention
at
this
issue
by
the
state.
mr.
robert
bartels
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
bartels
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
rationale
in
those
cases
was
carefully
limited
to
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
exclusionary
ruling.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
rather
different
purposes
behind
that
exclusionary
rule
and
for
example
the
protection
of
the
right
to
counsel
that
is
involved
in
this
case
for
the
court
to
apply
stone
and
rice
in
this
case
would
be
a
tremendous
expansion
of
the
stone
and
rice
doctrine
well
beyond
the
rationale.
i
think
that
the
court
offered
in
that
case,
which
basically
related
to
the
purely
deterrent
rationale
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
i
think
we
have
that
here,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
sixth
amendment
on
the
terms
of
the
case.
your
honor,
what
the
state
basically
asked
this
court
to
do
in
this
particular
case,
is
to
hold
that
law
enforcement
officers
may
do
virtually
anything,
short
a
physical
violence
or
threats,
physical
violence
to
obtain
information
from
persons
formally
charged
with
crime
during
interrogation
processes
and
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court’s
opinion
in
this
case
would
mean
among
other
things
that
the
police
would
be
completely
free
to
ignore
the
existence
of
counsel
in
a
criminal
case
and
indeed
to
go
further
than
that
and
to
evade
counsel
through
what
the
state
itself
has
termed
trickery
and
deceit.
your
honor,
that
result
would
be
contrary
to
the
precedents
of
this
court.
it
would
emasculate
the
fifth
and
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
in
this
kind
of
situation
and
it
would
also
make
it
virtually
impossible
for
defense
counsel
to
operate
in
a
sensible
way
in
dealing
with
clients
and
the
police
in
criminal
cases.
thank
you.
