unknown
speaker
mr.
winders,
how
far
is
it
from
davenport
to
des
moines?
unknown
speaker
i
am
sorry,
but
grinnell?
unknown
speaker
mr.
winders
is
it
correct
that
mr.
leaming
statement
that
he
knew
the
body
was
in
the
area,
whatever
it
was,
was
a
false
statement?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
incorrect
that
he
knew.
unknown
speaker
so
that
was
a
false
statement.
unknown
speaker
state’s
position
as
to
why
he
made
the
statement,
if
it
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
try
to
in
effect
interrogate
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
or
more
narrowly
would
it
be
correct
to
say
that
he
wanted
the
defendant
to
reveal
the
whereabouts
of
the
child?
unknown
speaker
the
seven
minutes
that
you
indicated
you
wish
has
been
consumed.
unknown
speaker
i
think
we
have
atlases
available
if
we
need
to
check
that
counsel.
unknown
speaker
is
that
sort
of
an
agreement
enforceable
as
if
it
were
a
contract
under
iowa
law?
unknown
speaker
but
it
could
raise
constitutional
overtones,
but
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
any
state
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
would
say,
you
treated
just
like
you
would
a
contract
to
buy
some
potatoes.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
had
to
expect
that
there
was
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
whatever
that
means
as
my
brother
rehnquist
said
it
might
not
be…
unknown
speaker
we
just
ask
you
this
question,
am
i
mistaken
in
believing
that
the
trail
judge
in
your
state
found
that
there
was
an
agreement?
unknown
speaker
on
habeas
corpus,
on
federal
habeas
corpus
this
was
submitted
by
stipulation
between
the
parties
on
the
trail
record
and
if
the
district
court
accepted
the
fact
if
there
was
an
agreement,
and
therefore,
that
we
have
to
accept
that
as
a
fact
in
this
case.
am
i
mistaken
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well
the
answer
is
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
and
so
did
the
federal
district
court,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
could
be
a
way
that
it
should
make
its
finding
on,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
how
did
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
treat
that
point?
unknown
speaker
so,
as
the
record
stands
now
everybody
agrees
there
was
an
agreement
but
you…
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general
if
we
are
bound
by
the
finding
that
there
was
an
agreement,
what
is
your
view
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
broken
by
the
questions
that
were
asked
by
officer
leaming?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
indicated
earlier
that
the
officer
was
anxious
by
the
questions
he
asked
to
lead
williams
into
stating
where
the
body
was
located,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
would
you
regard
that
as
interrogation?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
he
had
not
been
put
under
the
oath
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
not
implied
really
mr.
attorney
general
what
you
indicated
earlier
and
that
is
that
the
officer
wanted
to
elicit
information
for
williams.
unknown
speaker
whatever
techniques
he
used,
i
would
suppose
a
lawyer
would
consider
that
he
was
pursuing
interrogation.
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
concede…
unknown
speaker
do
not
you
concede
though
mr.
turner
if
it
had
been
a
prosecuting
attorney
who
made
assuming
it
was
an
agreement
that
he
would
be
bound?
i
think
you
conceded
that
earlier.
unknown
speaker
well
it
was
a
matter
of
ethics
as
so
as
police
officers
bound,
but
what
significance
do
we
attach
ethics
in
this.
unknown
speaker
let
me
rephrase
the
question.
would
it
make
any
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
case,
if
“a”
there
has
been
an
agreement,
undoubted
and
“b”
it
had
been
made
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
rather
than
a
police
officer.
unknown
speaker
that
your
position
depends
on
the
fact
that
it
is
a
police
officer
rather
than
prosecuting
attorney.
so
i
am
trying
to…
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
sense
of
having
a
lawyer?
if
you
cannot
have
a
lawyer
to
make
an
agreement
to
for
you
to
protect
you.
unknown
speaker
when
did
he
waive
his
right
to
the
lawyer?
you
got
a
waiver
and
everything
else,
did
he
waive
that
too.
unknown
speaker
when?
unknown
speaker
did
he
say
anything
about
lawyer
or
waive?
unknown
speaker
but
did
he
say
anything
about
waive?
unknown
speaker
is
the
man
going
for
one
lawyer
and
he
asked
the
lawyer
go
along
with
him,
he
is
on
his
way
to
another
lawyer
and
in
between
the
two
lawyers,
he
waives
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
not
assume
that
this
is
disputed?
unknown
speaker
it
is
disputed.
unknown
speaker
he
needs
too
because
he
found
that
there
had
been
in
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
he
said
he
could
not.
the
police
said
he
could
not.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
i
think
the
peer
was
knowing,
that
you
are
not
allowed
to
ride
in
a
police
car
with
a
prisoner.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
when
did
he
waive
his
lawyer,
he
was
still
on
this
(inaudible)
the
record
that
has
waived.
unknown
speaker
anything
he
said
that
anybody
can
interpret
that
waive…
unknown
speaker
did
you
find
her
shoes?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
he
say?
oh!
he
said
you
did
not
find
the
shoes;
that
is
a
waiver
of
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
absolutely
asked
for
a
cup
of
coffee
that
would
have
been
a
waiver.
unknown
speaker
and
when
did
it
get
it
low
as
that.
unknown
speaker
that
is
one
of
these
often
--
unknown
speaker
he
waives
that
by
talking,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
us.
he
waives
the
right
to
the
advice
of
counsel
by
what
he
says
on
the
on
the
subsequent
aspects
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
would
it
not
be
more
accurate
to
say
in
this
context
that
he
knew
he
had
a
right
not
to
speak,
not
to
speak
to
the
officers
about
anything
relating
to
the
crime
and
he
had
been
told
that
by
several
police
officers
and
several
lawyers
and
that
that
is
the
known
right
that
he
waives,
the
right
not
to
speak?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
escobedo
case
in
which
judge
hanson
relied
so
heavily?
why
would
not
your
argument
equally
apply
to
escobedo
going
and
talking
if
his
lawyer
was
unable
to?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
judge
hanson
found
happened
here
too.
unknown
speaker
is
the
distinction
that
you
disagree
with
the
finding
or,
let
me
ask
you
this
way.
assume
that
finding
number
11
is
correct
that
the
lawyer
in
des
moines
or
davenport
asked
to
ride
alone,
but
it
was
refused
permission.
unknown
speaker
let
me
make
sure
you
understand
my
question.
the
finding
that
i
am
referring
to
reads
as
follows.
before
detective
leaming
left
for
des
moines
with
the
petitioner,
mr.
kelly
asked
detective
leaming
that
he
be
permitted
to
ride
along
in
the
police
car
to
des
moines.
this
request
was
refused
by
detective
leaming.
now,
assuming
that
it
is
a
correct
finding
and
i
understand
you
do
not
accept
it
because
it
was
not
made
by
the
state
trial
judge,
assuming
that
is
a
correct
finding,
how
do
you
differentiate
the
escobedo
case
or
can
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
your
brief
of
course
was
filed
in
february.
the
four
hour
decision
in
stone
against
powell
came
down.
this
is
a
habeas
action
as
it
comes
here.
have
you
given
any
consideration
as
to
whether
the
underlying
philosophy
of
stone
against
powell
would
have
application
here?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
is
as
you
know
the
very
threshold
point
that
your
adversary
makes
is
that
there
was
a
finding
on
this
case
that
the
respondent
statement
was
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
matter
of
law
involuntary
and
that
that
finding
has
not
been
challenged
and
if
that
is
true
then
all
this
talk
of
miranda
and
escobedo
and
everything
else
is
wholly
irrelevant
because
that
would
decide
this
case
and
that
was
a
factual
finding,
that
was
affirmed
on
appeal
and
its
not
been
challenged
by
you
in
this
court.
now,
i
have
read
you
reply
brief,
but
frankly
you
got
anything
else
to
say
in
answer
of
that
basic
proposition
beyond
what
you
said
in
your
reply
brief.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is
you
who
petitioned
this
court
to
upset
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
and
if
that
judgment
rests
upon
a
claim,
rests
upon
a
foundation
that
you
have
not
challenged
then
it
should
be
affirmed
on
that
foundation.
unknown
speaker
well,
miranda
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
voluntariness
at
all,
in
fact
that
is
the
volunateriness
in
fact
in
everything
that
triggered
the
case
unknown
speaker
that
you
say
so,
but
there
is
been
a
finding
of
the
contrary
that
your
opponent
says
you
have
never
attacked.
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
nothing
to
say
beyond
what
you
said
in
your
reply
brief
to
that
on
this
question.
unknown
speaker
right,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
say
that
that
is
forever
irrevocable?
unknown
speaker
other
way
about
the
rights
of
the
defendant,
not
the
rights
of
the
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the
treatment
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
of
the
polk
county
district
courts
finding
on
that
point.
the
supreme
court
syllabus
paragraph
10
refers
to
it
as
an
alleged
agreement
and
i
suppose
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
state
to
challenge
of
the
finding
in
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
since
the
district
judge
ultimately
sustained
a
guilty
verdict,
but
you
do
not
contend,
do
you
that
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
upheld
the
finding
that
there
was
an
agreement.
unknown
speaker
presumption
of
correctness
and
the
existence
of
something
called
an
agreement
by
all
the
courts
and
by
the
parties.
in
the
relationship
between
attorney
and
client,
who
is
the
master
and
who
is
the
servant?
unknown
speaker
it
has
been
argued
to
some
extent
as
though
at
were.
now,
taking
it
for
what
has
been
called
an
agreement
or
understanding,
understanding
might
perhaps
be
a
better
term,
would
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
but
your
client
williams,
the
defendant
in
the
case,
you
have
agreed
is
the
master
or
the
principle.
he
can
change
agreements
made
by
his
agent,
can
he
not
by
saying
on
it,
now,
i
want
to
talk?
unknown
speaker
hypothetically
i
mean
--
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
he
had
said
instead
of
that,
without
anything
at
all
he
says
i
want
to
tell
you
where
the
body
is
because
i
killed,
the
only
thing
wrong
with
that
is…
unknown
speaker
had
they
ridden
120
miles
in
complete
silence
and
suddenly
the
defendant
had
said
that
he
may
misbelieve
me
that
i
were
to
tell
you.
i
know
where
the
body
is,
i
am
going
to
show
you,
i
killed
her,
and
you
would
not
be
here,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
then
what
you
emphasize
is
that
leaming,
what
he
had
to
say
all
along,
which
led
finally
to
the
defendant
saying
what
he
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
objection
that
you
see
to
the
christian
burial
speech?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
matter
with
that?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
presumably
there
is
a
privilege
against
compulsory
self
incrimination,
but
suddenly
the
law
does
not
frown
on
incrimination
that
comes
voluntarily.
if
a
man
confesses
a
crime,
we
assume,
you
do
not
hold
it
against
him.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
it
coerce
somebody?
unknown
speaker
given,
the
record
as
it
now
here
mr.
bartels,
if
the
only
evidence
introduced
against
your
client,
the
defendant
at
all
was
his
statement,
did
you
find
the
shoes,
that
is
assume
nothing
else
beyond
that,
would
you
say
that
should
have
bend
excluded
under
the
exclusionary
rule?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
it
would
not
be
incriminating
evidence
to
have
that
introduced?
unknown
speaker
incriminating…
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
that
a
situation
would
prevail
on
that,
that
he
would
not
take
the
stand.
you
suggest
there
is
a
prosecutor
who
could
not
make
a
great
of
capital
out
of
that
in
his
closing
arguments,
all
the
other
circumstances,
the
evidence
at
the
ymca,
the
man
was
seen
carrying
a
bundle
with
two
legs
of
small
children
and
the
feet
with
shoes
on.
unknown
speaker
that
is
conclusive,
that
is
conclusive.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
search
for
the
clothing
and
the
blanket?
would
that
be
--
do
you
think
that
would
have
been
admissible?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
all
of
that
would
necessarily
be
barred
along
with
the
body
of
the
victim?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
question
about
the
agreement
if
i
may
mr.
bartels
along
the
line
i
asked
the
attorney
general
about
your
theory.
supposing
that
i
am
defense
counsel
and
you
are
a
prosecuting
attorney
and
i
come
to
you
and
i
say
i
know
you
have
got
my
client
under
suspicion,
here
is
the
$1000,
you
promise
not
to
interrogate
him
for
the
next
ten
days.
now,
you
take
the
$1000
and
you
call
him
before
a
grand
jury
five
days
later,
do
you
think
that
is
an
enforceable
agreement?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
in
agreement
between
parties
like
this
is
enforceable;
this
is
it
or
a
contract?
unknown
speaker
then
what
you
are
saying
is
it
is
improper
because
it
is
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right,
not
because
of
iowa
contract
law?
unknown
speaker
but
then
the
agreement
itself
is
not
separately
enforceable
to
bar
the
evidence.
it
is
simply
a
factor
to
be
taken
in
consideration
to
see
whether
the
defendant’s
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bartels
you
keep
raising
the
point
about
not
let
him
in
the
car,
was
he
not
told
that
it
is
against
police
regulations,
it
was
impossible?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
true?
unknown
speaker
well,
any
police
regulations
you
read
will
tell
you
that
lawyers
cannot
ride
in
cars
with
their
client.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
i
thought
you
put
too
much
emphasis
on
it;
that
is
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
the
only
basis
the
eighth
circuit
rested
on
this,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
you
think
so.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
it
all,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
district
court’s
decision
on
that
had
stood
in
the
deal
with
the
eighth
circuit,
why
would
it
had
been
necessary
to
get
into
issues
like
miranda
and
the
right
of
counsel.
why
would
it
not
simply
have
affirmed
on
the
involuntariness
point?
unknown
speaker
if
we
should,
if
this
court
should
reject
the
miranda
and
the
sixth
amendment
grounds
and
be
unwilling
to
pass
upon
the
involuntariness
grounds,
i
suppose
that
the
case
should
be
sent
back
to
the
eighth
circuit,
so
that
it
could
consider
whatever
the
state
had
to
say
about
the
involuntariness
finding
being
clearly
erroneous.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
the
eighth
circuit,
the
voluntariness
issue
was
clearly
presented
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
was
litigated
there,
and
i
think
the
affirmance
of
the
lower
court
opinion
means
that
they,
the
lower
court’s
decision
was
affirmed.
unknown
speaker
there
is
not
sense
in
the
eight
circuit
is
opinion
that
it
was
first
a
voluntary.
unknown
speaker
except
in
the
dissent.
unknown
speaker
up
to
now
you
have
not
been
talking.
i
am
asking
this
question,
up
to
now
your
argument
has
not
relied
on
the
miranda
case
and…
unknown
speaker
it
is
rely
rather
on
the
massiah
and
escobedo
and
basically
on
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
unknown
speaker
well,
here
is
another
question,
the
question
of
waiving
the
right
to
remain
the
silent
on
this
very
crucial
subject.
i
think
it
is
a
different
question
from
waiving
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
right
stems
from
miranda
that
you
are
arguing
now,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
could
not
be,
because
stone
against
powell
had
come
down
in
a
long
while.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
say
about
stone
and
powell,
would
you
think
that
could
control
here?
unknown
speaker
tell
us
why.
