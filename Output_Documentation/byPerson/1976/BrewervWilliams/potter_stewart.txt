justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
virtue
of
the
grant
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
in
this
case
in
iowa
trial
jury
found
the
respondent,
robert
williams,
guilty
of
the
murder
of
a
10-year-old
girl.
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
affirmed
in
the
iowa
supreme
court
by
a
closely
divided
vote.
in
a
subsequent
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
a
federal
district
court
ruled
that
under
the
united
states
constitution,
williams
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial,
and
a
divided
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
agreed.
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
wrong.
the
district
court
held
that
williams,
after
he
had
been
arraigned
and
had
consulted
with
two
different
lawyers,
had
been
deprived
of
his
constitutionally-protected
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
during
the
course
of
a
160-mile
automobile
trip
from
davenport,
iowa
to
des
moines,
iowa
in
a
custody
of
two
police
officers.
the
court
further
found
that
williams
had
not
waived
the
protection
of
this
constitutional
guarantee.
accordingly,
the
district
court
held
that
incriminating
information
disclosed
by
williams
to
the
police
officers
during
the
automobile
ride
was
wrongly
admitted
in
evidence
against
williams
at
his
iowa
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
district
court
and
affirmed
its
judgment.
and
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail,
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
also
agree
and
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
although
we
do
not
likely
affirm
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
case,
so
clear
a
violation
of
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
as
here
occurred,
cannot
be
ignored.
the
pressures
on
state
executive
and
judicial
officers,
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law,
are
often
great,
and
especially
so,
when
the
crime
is
murder
and
the
victim,
a
child.
but
it
is
precisely
the
predictability
of
these
pressures
that
makes
imperative
a
resolute
loyalty
to
the
guarantees
that
the
constitution
extends
to
us
all.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
marshall,
mr.
justice
powell,
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
who,
along
with
mr.
justice
brennan,
have
joined
the
opinion
of
the
court,
have
also
each
filed
concurring
opinions.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wish
to
add
that
mr.
justice
white
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
and
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
