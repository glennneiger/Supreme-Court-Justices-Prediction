justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
in
the
briefs
here,
nobody
seems
to
have
identified
the
most
analogous
state
statute
or
argued
about
which
one
it
might
be.
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
in
california,
so
it
will
be
a
california
statute
if
your
second
argument
is
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
and
might
it
be
a
different
statute
if
it
is
one
for
money
back
pay
from
--
i
thought
it
might
be
if
it
were
only
for
an
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
only
if
in
injunction
there
will
be
no
statute
at
all,
but
the
state
doctrine
of
laches.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
no
identification
any
where
in
these
briefs
that
i
saw
of
what
the
most
analogous
state
statute
might
be.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
that,
what
is
that
statute
for
a
penalty
or
for
or
is
it
a
catch
all
statute
or…
justice
potter
stewart
each
was
one
year
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
then
it
was
a
pattern
of
practice
suit,
was
not
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
the
way
up
to
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
is
not
it.
all
the
way
forward
in
time
until
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
was
not
it
an
allegation
of
a
continuing
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
when
the
statute
began
to
run,
it
is
your
claim
that
it
ran
from
the
discharge
of
the
original
complaining
party.
justice
potter
stewart
but
arguably,
it
might
run
from
the
--
according
to
that
government’s
allegation
that
it
was
going
on
at
the
time
of
the
suit.
justice
potter
stewart
in
one
of
these
two
cases,
76-99,
i
am
authorized
to
announce
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court
in
this
case
being
occidental
life
insurance
company
against
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
a
case
which
is
hereon
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
in
1972,
congress
amended
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
so
as
to
empower
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
to
bring
suit
in
a
federal
district
court
against
a
private
employer
alleged
to
have
violated
the
act.
the
only
question
presented
by
this
case
is
what
time
limitation,
if
any,
is
imposed
on
the
eeoc's
power
to
bring
such
a
lawsuit
in
a
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
in
this
case
held
that
the
federal
statute
requires
that
an
enforcement
action
must
be
brought
within
180
days
after
the
filing
of
a
charge
with
the
eeoc.
alternatively,
the
court
held
that
the
action
was
subject
to
the
most
appropriate
state
limitation
statute
and
was
therefore
barred
by
the
one-tear
limitation
provision
of
a
section
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
federal
law
does
not
impose
a
180-day
limitation
upon
the
eeoc's
authority
to
sue
and
that
the
action
is
not
covered
by
any
state
statute
of
limitations.
we
granted
certiorari
to
considering
important
and
reoccurring
question
regarding
title
vii.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
and
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk,
we
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice.
