justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
he
lapsed
here?
it
would
have
been
barred
even
by
the
three
year
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
not
that
the
reverse
of
what
one
would
usually
think
the
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
the
government
usually
has
a
longer
period
of
limitations
or
governmental
agencies
has
a
longer
period
of
limitation
than
a
private
individual.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
why
does
not
that
govern
ms.
vaughn's
right
here
rather
the
charging
party
is
right
here,
is
that
that
she
did
not
receive
the
notice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
you
do
not
see
that
with
an
ordinary
statute
of
limitation,
if
the
statute
of
limitation
requires
the
owner
to
indict
somebody
and
within
four
years
or
bring
a
civil
action
in
four
years,
you
do
not
say
to
the
defendant
has
a
shared
responsibility,
we
both
have
to
get
this
case
to
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
are
not
obligated
conciliate,
the
way
the
eeoc
isâ€¦
