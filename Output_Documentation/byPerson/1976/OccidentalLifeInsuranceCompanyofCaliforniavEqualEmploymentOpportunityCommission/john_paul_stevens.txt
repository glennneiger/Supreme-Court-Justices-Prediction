mr.
vaughn,
may
i
ask
you
question
just
to
get
the
whole
thing
that
you
told.
no
right
to
sue
letter
was
issued
to
the
employee
in
this
case
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
was
leading
up
to
is,
does
she
now
have
a
right
to
sue
if
she
got
the
right
kind
of
letter
from
the
eeoc?
would
she
be
barred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
would
not
be
barred?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
the
question
little
differently.
if
instead
of
suing
itself,
the
eeoc
had
issued
the
appropriate
letter
to
her,
could
she
have
been
a
part
of
suit,
you
know
a
couple
of
years
had
gone
by?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
really
asking
i
suppose
is
because
you
do
not
rely
on
express
limitation
language,
but
rather
an
implied
limitation
and
the
statutory
schemes
seems
to
put
together,
as
you
argued
it.
but,
does
that
also
mean
that
there
is
a
total
--
it
really
is
a
statutory
pose
after
this
period
of
time
is
gone
by
and
the
employer
can
now
be
sure
there
is
no
litigation
coming.
is
there
a
correlation
between
the
private
right
to
sue
and
the
government
right
to
sue?
all
we
have
to
decide
is
that
we
donâ€™t
have
to
decide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
it
may
be
relevant
mr.
vaughn
is
that
if
you
are
arguing
an
implicit
limitation
rather
than
express
limitation,
at
least
we
must
have
a
pretty
clear
picture,
how
the
whole
statutory
scheme
puts
together,
that
is
why
it
was
troubling
me
and
i
think,
i
know
that
it
could
maybe
necessary
to
at
least
take
that
through
and
i
am
not
sure
what
the
answer
is.
