mr.
thomas
s.
martin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
1972
congress
authorized
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
to
enforce
title
vii
in
court
and
abandoned
dependence
upon
private
enforcement
that
was
universally
deemed
to
be
totally
ineffective.
section
706
which
is
the
focus
of
this
litigation
was
designed
to
put
the
government’s
enforcement
muscle
behind
title
vii.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
whether
congress
intended
that
that
enforcement
muscle
disappear
after
180
days,
after
the
filing
of
the
claim
or
in
the
alternative
terminate
according
to
the
very
mandates
of
state
statutes
of
limitations?
before
i
go
to
the
merits,
i
would
like
to
briefly
expand
upon
the
factual
context
in
which
this
delay
claim
arises.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
there
is
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
they
did
not
intent
to
have
a
short
state
statute
or
a
180
day
limitation.
i
think
to
put
it
very
briefly
and
i
will
get
back
to
it
at
further
lane.
congress
knew
when
it
imposed
upon
the
eeoc
the
requirement
to
investigate,
to
conciliate
and
to
resolve
as
many
of
these
problems
by
conciliation
as
it
could.
congress
knew
that
that
process
took
18
to
24
months
and
yet
congress
required
that
as
a
pre-requisite
before
you
bring
a
commission
suit
under….
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
congress
was
unhappy
with
that.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
correct,
it
has
unhappy
about
it,
but
it
did
not
cut
it
off.
i
could
go
just
a
bit
farther,
i
think
i
can
address
your
concern
as
i
develop
it.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
indicate
now
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
area.
first
let
me
talk
about
this
case,
then
what
the
commission
does
generally
in
response
of
your
question.
when
this
case
was
brought
at
the
san
francisco
office
of
the
eeoc
had
fewer
investigators
than
there
are
members
of
this
court.
it
had
a
1,000
discrimination
claims
before
it.
nevertheless
they
got
to
this
claim
within
six
months,
investigation
was
completed
within
a
year.
but,
then
four
months
later
conciliation
was
begun
with
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
conciliation
went
on
for
another
six
months
and
then
it
was
ended
and
then
at
petitioner’s
request
conciliation
was
begun
again
for
an
additional
five
months.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
conciliation
is
after
of
the
commission
has
found
out
what
the
facts
of
the
problem
are
and
the
scope
of
the
discrimination
which
just
occurs
in
the
particular
or
alleged
to
occur
in
the
particular
industry.
they
sit
down
with
the
individual
respondent
and
tend
to
work
out
an
agreement,
either
for
back
pay
possibly
or
for
an
end
to
the
particular
discriminatory
practice.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
72
amendments
and
64
act
really
was
to
try
to
resolve
as
many
as
these
claims
through
conciliation
as
possible
so
they
do
not
end
up
in
court.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
conciliation
could,
you
can
imagine
a
situation
where
you
have
the
company
like
at&t,
a
massive
company,
thousands
of
people
involved,
hundreds
of
job
categories,
wages,
transfer
rights,
unions
involved.
it
is
a
very
difficult
process
it
may
involve
difficult
legal
issues
and
everyone
wants
to
go
back
and
analyze
those
legal
issues.
so
as
long
as
conciliation
is
worthwhile,
the
commission
has
to
follow
it
out,
the
statute
says
it
can
only
bring
suit
when
conciliation
has
failed.
that
is
the
congressional
pre-requisite
to
suit,
the
commission
has
no
choice,
it
can't
end
the
business
on
the
179
day
and
sue
because
congress
has
required
to
resolve
these
matters
through
conciliation
were
possible,
that
is
what
is
it
is
about.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well
let
us
talk
about
results
i
think
it
is
and
get
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question.
5,000
claims
last
year
were
resolved
through
conciliation.
now,
there
were
over
40,000
discrimination
claims
resolved
last
year
by
eeoc
and
that
is
with
2,500
fulltime
employees,
5,000
resolved
through
conciliation,
the
percentage
of
claims
over
three
years
old
was
reduced
from
20%
to
5%.
so
my
point
i
guess
is
that
when
you
have
the
delay,
it
is
a
shared
responsibility,
it
is
not
just
the
eeoc,
it
arises
out
of
the
nature
of
the
work
that
conciliation
process,
the
magnitude
of
the
discrimination
problem
in
this
country
and
the
limitations
on
the
eeeoc
resources.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no,
but
i
do
say
that
if
the
situation
is
such
the
congress
has
required
a
conciliation,
and
conciliation
is
a
two
party
business
in
other
words
respondents
can,
can
encourage
you
to
continue
and
say
it
is
still
worthwhile
and
coalition
has
to
continue
it,
congress
must
have
setup
a
system
that
reflects
this
reality.
what
i
am
saying
is
if
you
look
at
the
scope
of
the
problem
and
the
resources
available,
you
get
some
reflection
of
what
congress
must
have
intended,
sure
justice
rehnquist
if
there
was
clear
statute
of
limitation,
there
would
be
no
defense
to
say
it
is
partly
the
respondent’s
fault
that
we
have
not
met
it.
but
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
there
is
no
clear
statute
of
interpretation
in
statute
of
limitations
and
one
should
not
be
implied.
i
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case
in
particular
to
the
language
of
section
706(f)(1)
which
reads,
i
think
it
is
important
what
the
language
says,
it
says,
if
within
180
days
from
the
filing
of
such
charge
the
commission
has
not
filed
a
civil
action.
the
commission
shall
so
notify
the
person
aggrieved.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
interpretation
of
that
language
from
our
point
of
view
is
that
it
imposes,
it
does
two
things,
it
sets
out
a
time
within
which
the
commission
can
conciliate
with
the
respondent
without
interference
from
private
sue,
private
party
can
not
sue
before
180
days
and
then
it
sets
its
time
after
which
the
private
party
can
demand
and
must
receive
from
the
commission
a
right
to
sue
letter.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
right
the
language
does
appear
to
do
that,
but
the
courts
that
have
interpreted
it,
courts
of
appeal
had
unanimously
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
could
not
possibly
meet
that
for
this
reason.
the
72
act
was
meant
to
setup
a
process
were
you
would
have
to
resolve
these
claims
through
conciliation
if
possible,
that
is
throughout
and
if
there
has
to
be
a
suit
it
ought
to
be
a
commission
suit
rather
than
a
private
suit.
now,
if
you
interpret
this
as
a
mechanical
limitation,
then
180
days
after
you
file
the
claim,
before
the
commission
has
even
probably
gotten
into
this
particular
claim,
the
private
party
is
going
to
have
to
sue
or
else
his
time
will
run
and
therefore
he
sues
without
either
the
thing
being
resolved
through
conciliation
or
without
knowing
that
the
commission
might
have
brought
suit,
if
he
had
waited.
so,
it
twists
around
the
whole
statute
and
fundamentally
upsets
or
frustrates
the
congressional
purpose.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
not
precisely
correct,
when
the
commission
has
decided
that
it
will,
it
cannot
conciliate
and
will
not
sue
itself,
in
other
words
to
fill
the
congressional
pre-requisites,
then
the
commission
must
notify
the
charging
party.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
with
or
without
request.
apart
from
that,
it
only
notifies
upon
request.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
am
so
much
disturbed
about
the
characterization,
if
it
takes
a
long
time
to
make
that
decision,
it
could
go
on
three
years,
it
could
go
on
for
four
years.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
correct
it
could
go
on.
now
let
us
--
i
think
it
worthwhile
to
talk
about,
how
the
courts
can
respond
to
that
problem
aside
form
the
statute
of
limitations
and
i
think
there
are
two
ways,
first
is
in
terms
of
the
remedy.
if
it
is
a
truly
stale
claim
an
injunctive
remedy
will
not
be
appropriate.
if
it
is
a
--
we
talked
about
back
pay
which
is
under
consideration
here,
in
albemarle
this
court
said,
prior
to
acquainting
file,
but
in
albemarle
this
court
said
that
if
a
cause
of
action
was
prosecuted
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
cause
prejudice
to
the
opposing
party,
back
pay
could
be
denied
altogether
and
in
eeoc
versus
general
electric
which
is
at
532
f.
2d
359,
the
fourth
circuit
said
that,
in
a
situation
where
a
commission
suit
has
expanded
the
claims
beyond
what
the
charging
party
originally
brought,
back
pay
could
be
limited,
not
denied
altogether
but
limited.
so
there
are
equitable
ways
in
terms
of
title
vii’s
remedy
to
deal
with
this
problem.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
not
think
they
are
justice
blackmun,
the
point
of
the
whole
72
amendments
is
that
he
does
not
have
to
bring
the
suit,
the
commission
brings
the
suit
and
so…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
am
not
arguing
that
it
is
better
from
--
that
this
court
should
think
it
is
better
or
that
i
think
it
is
better
i
am
arguing
that
congress
thought
it
is
better
and
the
reason
is
as
they
set
out
in
the
legislative
history,
that
the
cause
of
bringing
suit
from
their
point
of
view,
was
so
great
that
a
valid
title
vii
claims
--
let
me
quote
if
the
cost
involved
effectively
preclude
a
very
large
percentage
of
valid
title
vii
claims
from
ever
being
litigated.
that
is
a
quote
in
our
brief
at
26
and
what
the
congress’
saying
is
that
it
is
better
for
the
commission
to
bring
suit
because
private
parties
will
not
bring
suite,
they
do
not
have
the
money.
we
do
get
counsel
fees
and
you
had
counsel
fees
in
64
act
and
yet
congress
made
a
factual
determination
in
72
that
was
insufficient,
that
was
congress’
judgment
and
let
me
give
you
some
reasons
why
they
were
probably
right.
attorney’s
fees
first
of
all,
only
discretionary,
only
if
you
win,
it
is
only
at
the
end
of
a
process
which
may
take
years,
the
clause
to
that
title
vii
suit
are
not
just
attorney’s
fees,
they
are
expert
witnesses,
computer
time,
experts
on
management
testing,
investigators,
it
is
a
difficult
and
complex
process
to
bring
a
title
vii
suit
and
congress
says
“let
us
take
this
burden
off
the
private
parties
because
it
is
not
working
and
put
that
burden
on
the
government”
first
giving
them…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
excuse
me.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
they
wanted
to
give
as
the
report
of
the
conference
committee
suggests
rather
clearly,
congress
realize
that
the
process
may
take
18
or
24
months
and
therefore
they
said,
if
a
private
party
wants
to
get
out,
wants
to
escape
the
administrative
quagmire
as
the
house
report
says,
it
will
have
the
option
to
do
so.
they
gave
that
party
the
option
after
180
days.
any
charging
party
the
fourth
commission
after
180
days
can
just
come
to
the
commission
and
say,
i
want
to
get
out
of
this,
i
want
to
sue
myself.
but
to
a
great
bulk
of
them,
that
is
too
expensive
for
proposition
or
at
least
that
is
what
congress
determined
and
it
seems
that
the
statute
has
to
be
interpreted,
in
view
of
what
congress
intended,
but
what
their
view
of
the
problem
was.
well,
we
agree
with
those
who
are
not
at
this
point.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
in
two
fashions,
first
in
terms
of
the
remedy,
taking
either
no
injunction,
no
back
pay
or
limiting
back
pay.
another
possibility
which
was
done
by
the
fifth
circuit
is
the
use
of
the
apa,
5
u.s.c.
706.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
a
claim
that
is
prejudicial,
because
it
is
so
stale.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
yes,
under
5
u.s.c.
section
706,
the
courts
of
appeals
had
held
in
fifth
circuit
and
i
site
the
court
to
exchange
security
bank,
529
f.2d
1214,
these
are
cited
in
also
in
the
briefs
of
one
of
the
amicus
here,
the
texas
brief.
the
charging
party
can
come
in
show
to
the
court,
that
there
has
been
prejudice
to
him
from
the
destructs
of
evidence
as
a
result
of
delay
and
the
delay
is
not
--
is
a
result
of
eeoc
in
action
lethargy
or
the
desolating
the
suits
sit
around
and
the
court
can
stop
the
suit.
so,
there
is
the
result
that
similar
to
laches
that
can
be
achieved
under
the
apa.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
is
very
much
like
laches
except
it
is
under
the
apa.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
i
think,
again
i
reference
the
court
to
those
opinions
and
the
guidelines
laid
down
are
that
you
have
to
have
it
--
in
the
nature
of
laches
that
you
have
got
to
show
prejudice.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
it
is
a
difficult
case,
we
do
not
expect
that
there
will
be
that
many
cases.
let
me
talk
about
the
results
of
what
would
happen
if
we
fouled
the
petitioner’s
proposal.
180
days
statute
of
limitations
means
that
the
96,000
claims
that
are
going
to
be
filed
before
the
eeoc
this
year.
eeoc
could
get
the
very
few
of
them
if
any,
as
upon
a
backlog
situation,
but
thousands
of
pending
claims
first
of
all,
there
are
over
100,000
pending
claims,
it
would
that
all
be
out
in
the
courts.
the
new
claims
90,000
a
year
would
be
in
the
courts.
does
that
make
any
sense
especially
might
have
congress’
determination
of
these
things
ought
to
be
resolved
through
conciliation.
it
is
what
exactly
what
congress
was
trying
to
avoid
and
if
you
have
a
180
day
limitation,
there
is
no
other
result
possible.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
a
state
statute
of
limitations?
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
the
state
statute
of
limitations,
first
as
a
legal
matter,
the
rule
has
always
been
that
state
statutes
do
not
apply
to
the
federal
government
in
the
absence
of
some
intent…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
oh
yes,
but
the
tort
claims
act
claims
act
specifically
requires
the
application
state
law.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
okay,
on
the
policy
point,
it
gives
the
commission
somewhat
more
time,
but
we
have
to
understand
the
state
statute
of
limitations
may
run,
maybe
a
year
statute
of
limitation
for
example.
the
commission’s
cause
of
action
may
not
accrue
for
300
days
after
the
injury
has
occurred
and
what
sense
does
it
make
to
apply
a
state
statute
of
limitation
when
the
commission’s
cause
of
action
does
not
accrue
because
the
commission
can
not
sue,
until
the
claim
has
been
filed
which
in
some
cases
maybe
300
days
after
the
injury
occurred.
usually
it
is
180,
depends
upon
if
there
is
a
state
fdp
system.
secondly,
the
commission
has
to
investigate
and
conciliate
and
go
through
all
those
steps
and
until
it
finishes
that
process,
no
cause
of
action
accrues.
so,
you
have
a
state
time
limitation
running
and
yet
the
commission
can
not
sue.
there
can
hardly
be
a
sensible
result.
it
just
does
not
work
and
moreover
it
is
not
necessary.
if
there
is
a
prejudice,
a
real
prejudice
case
and
this
is
not,
petitioner
has
never
alleged
he
was
prejudiced,
he
obviously
shared
responsibility
for
the
delays
here,
but
if
there
was
one,
then
the
courts
could
take
care
of
that
on
ad
hoc
basis
through
the
apa
or
through
the
relief
provisions.
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
to
the
two
assumptions
that
petitioner
made
at
the
outset
that
somehow
the
congress
views
the
delayed
problem
is
resulting
from
eeoc
inaptitude
and
congress
decided,
well
let
us
put
a
stop
to
it
by
putting
in
this
180
day
provision.
there
is
two
reasons
why
that
is
got
to
be
wrong,
first
congress
views
the
delay
problem
is
resulting
from
the
scope
of
the
commission’s
task
and
not
from
eeoc
foot
dragging.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
12
of
the
house
report
92238
where
congress’
view
that
delay
arises
from
“the
burgeoning
workload
accompanied
by
insufficient
funds
and
a
shortage
of
staff”
and
the
senate
report,
19415
at
page
4,
describes
the
eeoc’s
effort
as
heroic
at
that
point.
does
that
sound
like
congress
wants
to
put
a
180
day
limitation
on
it,
just
does
not
make
sense,
secondly,
the
language
that
they
are
relying
upon,
the
notification
provision
could
not
have
been
response
to
the
delay
problem
because
that
language
was
in
the
64
act.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
and
then
congress
had
the
choice
to
eliminate
the
process
altogether
or
greatly
expand
the
staff
and
put
some
reasonable
time
limitations.
but
congress
did
neither…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
absolutely,
but
that
the
opposite
assumption
must
be,
that
congress
had
a
process
that
took
18
to
24
months
and
said,
well,
from
now
on,
it
is
going
to
take
180
days
and
that
is
it.
it
just
can
not
work
as
long
as
congress
wants
to
have
resolved
these
claims
through
conciliation
and
through
commission
suit
and
not
private
suit.
if
that
is
the
intent
and
i
think
if
you
read
the
legislative
reports
that
has
to
be
the
intent.
then
there
can
not
be
such
assured
stage
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
i
do
have
the
claims
on
the
successful
conciliation
that
the
5000
figure
i
gave
you
was
a
successful
conciliation
out
of
40,000
claims
filed.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
successful
and
in
terms
of
litigation,
i
do
not
have
those
figures,
but
once
again…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
oh,
absolutely
not…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
many
of
them
were
dismissed
for
lack
of
evidence…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
what
i
am
talking
about
is
that
the
private
party,
if
the
commission
is
cut
off
after
180
days,
the
private
party
has
no
alternative
but
to
go,
file
a
suit.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
congress
determined
that
they
were
valid
claims
not
been
taken
care
off
because
of
the
cost
were
too
great.
so,
you
are
either
are
going
to
have
the
valid
claims
being
not
taken
care
off
in
contravention
of
the
72
amendments
or
you
are
going
to
have
these
people
filing
suit.
it
is
one
or
the
other,
some
people
may
drop
out
altogether.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
to
litigate
them
all,
enormous
number,
i
do
not
have
any
study
to
respond
to
your
question…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
do
not
think,
we
simply
do
not
have
those
figures…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
a
large
percentage
are
found
to
be
lacking
in
evidence
and
are
not
enough
for
suit.
but
is
not
it
better
to
have
that
found
out
through
conciliation
process
or
commissions
than
people
at
the
court.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
litigation?
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no,
we
do
not
have
that,
we
do
not
have
that
figure.
if
i
can
come
up
with
that
figure,
i
will
submit
it
to
the
court
and
to
counsel.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think,
--
certainly
can
be
found
out
and
we
will
find
out
and
submit
it
to
the
court,
but
i
guess
what
we
are
suggesting
is,
congress….
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
no,
no,
eeoc
can
not
file
…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
we
can
not
file
them
because
we
have
not
filled
the
statutory
prerequisites.
we
have
not
affiliated
…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
it
would
not
take
the
pressure
off
because
the
statute
would
be
--
it
depends
when
a
statute
runs,
if
you
are
assuming
the
statute
runs
from
the
time
of
the
injury,
okay,
then
sometimes,
it’s
the
discrimination,
for
180
days
and
perhaps
300
days,
it
is
not
even
filed
with
the
commission
and
then
the
commission
still
has
to
investigate
and
conciliate
before
it
can
file
suit.
the
pressure
will
be
exactly
the
same
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
statute
runs
from
a
different
time.
let
me
know
the
fifth
circuit,
in
case
is
following
griffin
wheel,
they
tell
that
the
state
statute
is
told
during
the
commission
proceeding,
the
district
court
is
following
griffin
wheel,
and
in
that
situation,
i
refer
to
416
(f)
sub
1006,
the
only
district
court
case
following
griffin
wheel.
they
told
the
state
statute
while
the
commission
is
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
is
right,
he
said,
state
statute
applies.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
there
is
sometimes
delays
in
legal
profession,
i
will
agree
with
it.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
very
seldom
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
good
in
this
a
–
it
might
be
good
in
the
statute,
but
would
have
to
be
a
time
limit
that
is
consistent
with
the
workload
of
the
commission.
but
difficulty
of
the
problems
it
has
…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
and
the
process,
it
would
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
days
at
the
–
the
charge
maybe
differed
to
a
state
commission
and
they
might
never
get
it
until
300
days.
they
have
to
take
into
effect
that
you
have
to
conciliate
it
before
you
sue
and
you
take
into
effect
the
resources
they
have.
the
scope
of
the
discrimination
problem
in
this
country,
put
that
altogether
and
then
set
a
reasonable
statute
limitations,
that
might
be
good
for
congress
to
do.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
congress
did
not
do
it.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
yes,
justice.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
the
analogy
that
the
court
appeals
to
was
to
the
analog
deep
process,
in
which
the
court
said
the
no
state
statute
limitation
apply,
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
applies
there,
i
assume
not
in
trust
of
the
opinions.
congress,
i
think
the
way
they
were
coached
the
problem
is
that
congress
gave
the
commission,
a
special
role,
it
said
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
primary
enforcer
of
title
vi.
this
court
has
numerous
times
said
the
title
vi
is
the
greatest
importance
in
terms
of
policy.
so,
congress
had
determined
thirdly
that
it
is
a
factual
matter,
these
suits
would
not
be
brought
and
rights
would
not
be
vindicated
but
for
the
commission’s
suits
and
it
set
up
a
process
of
conciliation
and
then
litigation
where
necessary
and
if
litigation
is
necessary
that
the
commission
should
bring
it
and
then
these
limitations
was
frustrating.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
congress
would
expect
as
everyone
here
would
expect
the
courts
would
say
that
that
suit
is
barred,
that
particular
suit.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
by
–
as
i
suggest
that
the
apa
can
be
used
in
a
laches
type
concept,
the
bar
of
that
particular
suit.
what
i
am
suggesting
as
a
individual,
if
there
is
a
prejudice
claim,
the
courts
can
take
care
of
that.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
if
there
is
a
shelling
of
prejudice,
the
district
court
can
respond
by
limiting
backpay,
denying
backpay
altogether,
only
granting
injunction
or
not
granting
injunction
and
the
court’s
respond
to
the
particular
case,
but
if
we
propose
a
state
statute
limitations,
thousands
of
cases
which
congress
determine
ought
to
have
been
considered,
conciliated
and
possibly
suited
upon
by
the
commission
will
not
be…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
i
think
not,
there
is
been
no
showing
of
any,
there
is
been
no
claim
of
any.
if
petitioner
sits
down
and
asks
the
commission
to,
well,
let
us
continue
to
conciliate
a
bit
longer,
i
think
we
can
get
this
result,
then
the
commission
says,
yes,
we
will
conciliate
a
bit
longer
and
they
spend
another
six
months,
i
would
not
call
that
prejudice.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
this
case
does
in
response
to
the
question
raised
earlier,
raise
the
continuing
claim,
on
page
10
of
the
appendix,
there
is
reference
to
the
–
there
is
a
complaint
which
is
a
continuing
claim
of
title
vi
discriminations,
now,
this
case
would
go
on
because…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
that
would
be
a
possible
construction.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
and
then
the
commission
could
sue…
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
of
course
question
is
named
the
suit,
but
the
commission
does
not
want
the
private
parties
right
to
run
before
the
commission
has
decided
whether
or
not
it
will
sue.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
the
legislative
history
as
far
as
we
can
determine
it
the
other
way,
let
me
refer
you
justice
stevens
to
(inaudible)
mcdonalds,
517(f)(2)
130,
that
a
eighth
circuit
case,
which
analyses
this
particular
section
and
the
notice
provisions
and
notice
requirement,
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
in
that
regard,
but
legislature
history
simply
will
not
support
that
analysis.
mr.
thomas
s.
martin
well,
thank
you.
