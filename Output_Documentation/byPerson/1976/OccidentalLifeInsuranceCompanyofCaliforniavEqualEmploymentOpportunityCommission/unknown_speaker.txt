unknown
speaker
mr.
martin
is
there
one
other
alternative
that
congress
never
even
thought
about
the
limitations
question
and
government
action.
is
there
any
evidence
in
legislative
history
they
thought
about
this
problem?
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
pretty
effective
argument
to
the
fact
that
congress
was
not
very
happy
about
that.
unknown
speaker
but
then
they
did
not
quite
continue.
unknown
speaker
mr.
martin
do
you
have
any
knowledge
of
figures
as
to
how
many
cases
filed
with
the
commission
are
settled
by
conciliation
as
contrast
to
those
that
are
not?
unknown
speaker
what
is
conciliation?
unknown
speaker
conciliation
typically
could
go
on
for
six
months?
unknown
speaker
anything
other
than
joe
bonning(ph)?
unknown
speaker
may
i
stop
you
right
there
mr.
martin
and
ask
what
the
commission’s
view
is
as,
as
to
whether
that
imposes
any
time
limitation
within
which
the
commission
has
a
duty
to
notify
the
charging
party.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
says
the
commission
shall
so
notify,
is
that
seems
to
impose
a
duty
upon
the
commission
with
or
without
any
request?
unknown
speaker
well
in
other
words
as
i
understand
your
answer
and
this
reflects
to
the
earlier
question
by
my
brother
stevens,
your
position
is
first
of
all
that
there
is
no
time
limitation
within
which
the
notice
to
sue
must
be
given
and
secondly
that
there
is
no
duty
upon
the
commission
in
the
absence
of
a
request
to
ever
give
a
notice
to
sue,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
with
or
without
request?
unknown
speaker
in
that
that
decision
is
clearly
up
to
the
commission,
if
it
decides
that
it
is
going
to
take,
it
is
going
to
need
seven
years
and
it
does
not
have
to
notify
until
the
expiration
of
seven
years.
well
this
is
justice
stewart’s
question.
unknown
speaker
it
could
go
on
for
seven.
unknown
speaker
why
did
not
they
take
it
off,
completely?
unknown
speaker
why
did
not
they
take
it
off,
completely?
unknown
speaker
mr.
martin,
do
you
give
accompany
any
possibility
of
relief
from
a
stale
claim?
unknown
speaker
you
forgot
a
word,
i
said
stale
claim,
which
the
statute
of
limitations
would
just
wipe
out.
all
that
but
just
wipe
out….
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
way
at
all
that
a
company
could
come
in
and
have
the
case
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
like
laches?
unknown
speaker
but,
since
you
have
put
that
in
terms
of
the
broad
scope
of
the
equity
powers
of
the
district
judge,
are
not
you
opening
a
door
to
having
397
different
approaches
to
that
problem
by
397
different
district
judges.
the
court
of
appeals
can
not
really
lay
down
an
affective
set
of
guidelines.
unknown
speaker
guideline
that
does
not
guide
very
much.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
analogous
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
what
if
that
has
a
fall
back
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
we
manage
now
for
nearly,
for
over
20
years
to
function
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
using
much
more
illusive
standards
of
law,
state
law
than
a
statute
of
orientations.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
are
suggesting,
i
was
merely
responding,
to
your
suggestion
but
it
is
not
workable.
unknown
speaker
that
is
quite
possible,
is
not
that
congress
could
have
dropped
the
process
and
this
time
it
was
taking
too
long
without
in
anyway
reflecting
on
the
performance
of
the
individuals
who
are
doing.
maybe
the
government
just
did
not
have
enough
staff
in
the
agencies.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
suggest
that
congress
always
carefully
works
these
things
out,
they
have
enlarged
a
lot
of
causes
of
action
the
courts
without
creating
a
whole
lot
of
new
judgeships
too.
unknown
speaker
out
of
every
100,000
claims
that
are
filed
with
the
eeoc,
what
percentage
are
a;
conciliated
successfully
or
two;
litigation
is
filed?
unknown
speaker
5000
out
of
40?
unknown
speaker
but
you
certainly
did
not
file
a
suit
in
the
other
35,000?
unknown
speaker
even
though
there
was
no
time
limit...
unknown
speaker
but
even
though
there
was
no
time
limit
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
so,
when
we
are
talking
about
all
these
cases
being
filed
on
the
courts,
you
are
only
talking
about
the
cases
that
you
think
you
have
a
successful
--
a
pretty
good
chance
for
conciliating,
but
you
do
not
have
time
to
do
it.
so,
you
file
a
suit.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
does,
he
certainly
has
an
alternative,
he
can
access
his
chances
and
say,
i
have
got
a
lousy
chance
and
then
do
not
file
a
suit.
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
most
private
parties
can
not
afford
to
sue
anyway.
unknown
speaker
you
mentioned
100,000
cases
a
year,
new
case.
assuming
just
for
the
moment
that
there
were
that
many
meritorious
claims
which
is
a
large,
large
assumption.
how
many
hundreds
of
lawyers
would
it
take
to
process
those,
any
studies
or
any
estimates
on
that
at
all?
unknown
speaker
in
percentages,
how
many
cases
are
counted
to
be
lacking
in
merit
or
frivolous?
unknown
speaker
it
is
very
large
percentage
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in
volume
how
many
eeoc
cases
have
been
filed
by
eeoc?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
that
is
not
surprising
you,
in
terms
of
the
number
of
claims
filed,
i
should
think
you
would
know,
the
commission
would
know.
unknown
speaker
this
is
pertinent
to
the
argument
you
were
making,
that
180
days
is
the
limitation,
it
is
going
to
be
a
flat
more
on
eeoc
case.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see,
you
will
turn
them
over
to
the…
unknown
speaker
you
take
this
alternative
round,
the
analogous
statement
is
statute
of
limitations.
that
would
take
enormous
amount
of
this
pressure,
this
180
day
pressure
that
you
speak
of,
off
of
the
commission,
would
it
not
and
it
would
not
be
any
great
research
undertaking
to
have
someone
makeup
a
table
of
all
the
analogous
statutes
of
the
fifty
states
of
the
district
of
colombia,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
griffin
wheel
took
the
other
position
from
the…
unknown
speaker
and
the
process…
unknown
speaker
mr.
martin.
unknown
speaker
is
there
using
in
any
of
the
federal
commission
or
agency
that
is
authorized
to
bring
suits
against
private
citizens
without
any
statute
of
limitation
forever
infinity
action.
unknown
speaker
do
you
really
think
that
congress
would
allow
a
suit
15,
20
years
afterwards?
unknown
speaker
by
what?
unknown
speaker
prejudiced
in
the
sense
that
interest
runs
on
claims
for
backpay
and
on
the
uncertainty
as
to
whether
positions
can
or
can
not
be
filled
or
about
the
individuals,
there
is
always
prejudice.
unknown
speaker
has
there
been
prejudice
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what
is
left
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
martin,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this
statutory
language
shall
so
notify
the
person
agreed
and
so
forth,
the
mandatory
language.
is
it
possible
to
read
that
section
to
say
that
if
the
condition
is
preceding
that
namely
that
180
days
are
gone
by
and
there
is
been
no
conciliation
so
about
the
lapsed,
then
the
commission
has
a
mandatory
duty
to
notify
by
the
private
plaintiff
who
may
then
bring
suit
within
90
days,
but
that
does
not
put
any
limit
on
the
commissions
right
to
being
subsequent
suit.
that
be
a
possible
construction?
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
be
all
it
says…
unknown
speaker
but
the
commission
does
not
so
interpret
it
that
way,
they
do
not
think
they
have
any
amendatory
duty
at
all.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that
is
what
congress
ordered
that
to
do.
unknown
speaker
no
further
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
vaughn,
in
another
few
minutes.
unknown
speaker
how
big
a
staff,
if
you
would
know?
