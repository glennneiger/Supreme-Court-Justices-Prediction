mr.
vaughn
i
am
little
concerned
about
the
practical
results,
if
you
prevail
here,
then
i
suppose
assuming
their
sufficient
manpower,
the
eeoc
will
bring
a
lot
of
suits
near
the
end
of
the
180
day
period.
is
that
something
that
would
be
beneficial
to
employers,
is
it
something
they
really
would
want?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
my
suggestion
was
that
they
might
be
clogged
even
more,
if
you
prevailed
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
those
ways
it
is
pretty
tough
on
the
employee,
arenâ€™t
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
seem
to
argue
all
the
way
through
that
it
is
so
much
better
for
the
eeoc
to
bring
suit
rather
than
the
employee,
why?
