mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
below,
that
the
eeoc
has
infinity
within
which
to
sue
on
an
individual
charge
of
discrimination.
in
other
words
that
there
is
no
time
limitation
whatsoever
upon
that
agency,
a
position
advocated
by
the
eeoc
to
that
court,
the
ninth
circuit
so
held
in
the
context
of
a
suit,
alleging
wide
ranging
practices
and
acts
of
sex
discrimination
against
both
females
and
males.
a
suit
that
was
predicated
upon
a
single
charge
of
discrimination
filed
by
one
individual
female
protesting
her
discharge
which
she
claimed
to
be
discriminatory
and
that
discharge
occurred
some
three
years
and
four
months
prior
to
the
date
upon
which
the
eeoc
got
into
the
federal
district
court
with
its
complaint.
now
it
is
petitioner’s
position
that
infinity
is
not
and
can
not
be
the
only
parameter
on
the
eeoc’s
right
to
sue.
first
it
is
our
position
that
inherent
in
the
statute
itself
is
a
180
day
limitation
on
the
right
to
sue
granted
to
the
eeoc
by
that
statute
and
secondly,
it
is
our
position
that
if
in
fact
there
is
no
federal
limitation,
then
the
most
analogous
state
statute
of
limitation
governs
the
eeoc’s
right
to
bring
suit.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
that
is
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
i
do
not
believe…
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
there
would
be
a
distinction
under
california
law,
under
the
california
statute
between
a
suit
for
injunctive
relief
and
a
suit
for
back
pay.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
because
of
its
view
that
there
was
no
limitation
whatsoever
did
not
reach
the
issue,
the
district
court
held
that
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations
in
california
was
applicable
and
that
was
an
alternative
holding
in
the
court’s
granting
of
our
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
had
held
that
there
was
a
180
day
federal
limitation
in
title
vii
and
alternatively
that
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations
under
california
law
was
applicable.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
that
is
the
statute
for
wrongful
injury;
it
is
code
of
civil
procedure
section
343,
injury
caused
by
the
wrongful
act
of
another.
now
there
is
additionally
a
second
statute,
code
of
civil
procedure
section
3381
which
is
an
action
upon
a
liability
created
by
statute
other
than
for
a
penalty
or
a
forfeiture.
so,
it
has
been
our
position,
it
was
our
position
before
the
district
court,
it
was
our
position
before
the
court
of
appeals,
that
one
of
the
two
statutes
was
applicable
regardless
of
which
applied,
the
suit
was
barred.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
no,
i
am
sorry,
the
first
for
wrongful
injury
is
one
year,
the
second
statute
is
three
years.
now
the…
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
yes,
that
is
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
complaint
was
filed
over
three
years
and
four
months
from
the
date
upon
which
the
discriminatory
act
occurred
being
the
discharge
of
the
charging
party
tamar
edelson
on
or
about
october
1,
1970.
suit
was
filed
on
february
22,
1974.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
mr.
justice
stewart,
when
the
suit
was
brought,
yes,
it
was
--
i
do
not
know
whether
pattern
in
practices
is
quite
the
right
word,
it
was
not
an
attorney
general
suit
under
the
old
pattern
in
practice
provisions
of
the
64
act,
but
it
did
allege
wide
ranging,
acts
and
practices
of
discrimination
by
the
petitioner
against
both
female
employees
and
male
employees,
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
effective
date
of
the
civil
rights
act
in
1965.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
mr.
justice
stewart,
yes.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
that
is
correct.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
it
should
be
recognized
that
nowhere
in
the
pleadings
before
the
district
court,
did
the
eeoc
at
any
time
argue
that
there
was
a
continuing
violation.
furthermore,
that
argument
came
into
this
proceeding
for
the
first
time,
in
a
reply
brief
it
was
filed
to
the
court
of
appeals
through
the
ninth
circuit.
it
does
not
appear,
i
do
not
believe
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
agency
or
by
the
solicitor
general
with
this
court.
but
in
any
event,
it
was
raised
for
the
first
time
belatedly
on
appeal.
now,
with
respect
to
the
180
day
federal
limitation,
that
limitation
is
found
in
section
706
act
i
of
the
act,
when
it
is
read
in
the
context
of
the
legislative
history,
certain
portions
of
which
i
would
like
to
highlight
to
the
court.
senator
dominick
who
was
the
principal
spokesman
for
the
bill
that
ultimately
has
the
senate
referred
to
the
180
day
provision
as
“the
time
period
within
which
the
commission
may
file
a
civil
action”
and
senator
javits
referred
to
it
as
“the
allowable
time
for
the
commission
to
move
into
a
given
situation.”
now,
these
were
not
the
only
two
comments,
throughout
the
legislative
history
there
was
the
very
strong
expression
by
congress
that
the
18
months,
the
two
years
that
it
was
taking
the
eeoc
then
to
act
was
unfair
to
charging
parties
was
a
denial
to
them
of
justice,
justice
delayed
is
justice
denied.
a
phrase
seen
throughout
the
legislative
history
and
there
was
a
determination,
a
very
strong
conviction,
that
the
same
delay
and
in
action
by
the
agency
was
unfair
to
respondents
and
there
was
a
clear
congressional
determination
in
1972,
that
this
situation
had
to
changed
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
continuing.
now
the
eeoc
has
struggled
to
breath
some
meaning
into
this
language,
the
180
day
language
as
an
alternative
to
our
interpretation
and
thus
the
eeoc
has
argued
that
because
congress
was
aware
in
72
that
it
took
a
year
or
two
for
the
eeoc
to
dispose
those
charges
because
there
was
a
backlog
that
congress
couldn’t
possibly
have
intended.
the
180
day
provision
as
a
suit
limitation
and
then
according
to
the
eeoc
the
180
day
provision
is
simply
an
expression
of
a
private
filing
restriction
on
the
individual
victim
of
discrimination.
but
this
position
necessarily
flounders,
both
on
the
expression
of
congressional
intention,
but
also
on
logic.
for
this
position
of
the
eeoc
assumes,
first
of
all
that
congress
intended
to
build
a
system
in
1972
that
would
perpetuate,
that
would
build
into
the
system
forever
more
the
very
delays
that
if
abhorred
and
was
attempting
by
the
new
mechanism
to
eliminate
and
secondly
the
eeoc’s
position
assumes
that
congress
made
the
deliberate
choice
to
extend
the
period
during
which
a
victim
of
discrimination
could
not
sue
himself
or
herself
even
though
congress
knew
full
well
that
the
eeoc
during
that
period
would
not
or
could
not
do
anything
for
that
victim
of
discrimination.
in
others
words
congress
in
1972
took
the
former
30
to
60
day
restriction
on
an
individual
filing
suit
and
extended
it
to
180
days.
now
did
congress
extended
just
to
restrain
the
individual
from
being
able
to
pursue
his
own
rights,
if
it
knew
that
the
eeoc
couldn’t
or
wouldn’t
do
anything,
it
simply
doesn’t
make
sense.
it
is
an
anonymous
and
incongruous
intention
to
attribute
to
congress
and
clearly
at
odds
with
their
manifest
intention.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
no
formal
notification,
the
record
demonstrates
that
she
was
advised
that
she
could
bring
suit
and
she
requested
that
the
case
be
sent
to
san
francisco,
the
eeoc’s
regional
litigation
office
for
consideration
as
a
vehicle
for
a
litigation.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
if
a
right
to
sue
letter
now
was
issued,
well
i
would
say
certainly
not
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
she
would
be
barred,
that
she
would
not
have
a
right
to
sue
at
this
juncture.
the
fact
is
that
it
is
quite
academic
i
would
say
to
ms.
edelson,
the
record
will
reflect
that
she
was
reinstated
in
her
job
six
days
after
the
charge
was
filed
and
thereafter
she
voluntarily
terminated.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
question
you
are
asking
me
is
what
are
the
conditions
to
make
some
suit
by
a
private
individual
and
that
of
course
is
not
a
question
before
the
court
in
this
case.
i
think
the
statute
if
read
logically
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
would
indicate
that
the
agency
had
180
days
in
which
to
act
having
not
acted
a
notice
of
right
to
sue,
should
have
been
forwarded,
a
formal
notice
which
it
was
not
and
then
the
charging
party
would
have
an
additional
90
day
period
thereafter.
i
think
therefore
that
ms.
edelson
would
not
now
have
the
right
to
sue.
it
is
now
after
all,
almost
seven
years
from
the
date
of
her
discharge.
i
think
that
she
would
be
barred.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
well,
mr.
justice
stevens
i
think
i
suggested
at
the
outset,
i
do
not
think
you
have
to
decide,
the
question
is
not
before
you.
i
do
think
as
i
indicated
logically
that
would
track
the
180
day
provision
and
the
90
day
provision
but,
frankly
i
can
see
that
the
court
might
take
a
different
approach
to
an
individual
charging
party,
who
had
not
received
notice
of
his
or
her
right
to
sue,
who
had
been
mislead
by
the
eeoc.
while
your
decision
in
johnson
versus
railway
express
agency
in
which
you
indicated
how
little
was
at
stake
in
that
case
in
fact
that
the
individual
was
not
been
able
to
sue
because
of
there
were
continuing
violations,
new
charges
could
be
brought.
that
case
i
think
could
be
argued,
on
the
other
side
of
what
i
have
indicated,
that
is
that
the
right
to
sue
would
be
barred.
i
think
it
is
a
difficult,
much
more
difficult
question
but
i
think….
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
mr.
justice
stevens
i
am
not
sure
what
the
answer
is
either,
i
can
only
say
i
do
not
think
you
need
to
decide
it
in
this
case
and
i
can
see
arguments
being
made
on
both
sides,
i
think
it
is
logical
that
she
would
be
barred,
i
believe
that
johnson
versus
rea
would
tend
to
support
that
conclusion.
on
the
other
hand
i
can
see
the
court
taking
a
different
view
perhaps
with
respect
to
an
innocent
party
who
has
been
mislead
by
the
eeoc.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
go
that
far
again,
i
do
not
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
the
question,
under
what
circumstances
a
charging
party
could
bring
suit.
our
position
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
eeoc
was
prohibited
in
this
case
from
bringing
suit
three
years
and
four
months
after
the
discharge
in
question,
whether
it
was
prohibited
by
a
180
day
federal
statute
or
whether
it
was
prohibited
by
a
state
statute,
the
most
applicable
state
statute.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
this
perhaps
is
a
unique
case
because
the
foundation
for
what
is
usually
the
case
i
believe
and
normally
would
be
an
interpretation
of
congressional
intention,
here
congress
was
outraged,
outraged
by
the
delays
and
the
inaction,
that
this
agency
was
pursuing
in
the
enforcement
of
the
act
and
they
intended
--
i
think
it
is
clear
to
put
a
relatively
short
time
limitation
upon
the
right
to
sue
after
all
in
this
same
section,
section
706(f)(1)
there
is
a
provision
that
the
charging
party
after
receiving
a
notice
of
right
to
sue
will
have
90
days
within
which
to
sue,
a
lesser
time
in
fact
than
the
180
days.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
well
we
have
no
issue
mr.
justice
rehnquist
before
assessed
ms.
edelson‘s,
the
charging
party’s
right
to
do
anything.
she
did
not
receive
the
formal
notice
of
right
to
sue,
the
record
will
demonstrate
that
she
was
advised
informally
of
her
right
to
sue
and
she
declined
the
pursue
at
requesting
that
the
matter
be
considered
as
a
possible
litigation
vehicle
and
that
of
course
is
in
turn
what
ended
up
happening
when
the
eeoc
brought
suit
low
some
three
years
four
months
later.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
think
not
only
would
employers
want
that
i
think
that,
that
is
what
charging
parties
would
want,
i
think
that
is
what
private
counsel
for
plaintiffs
want.
part
of
the
great
problem
with
the
inaction
of
the
eeoc
is
that
quite
frankly
from
an
employer’s
point
of
view
he
can
take
a
charge,
he
can
sweep
it
under
the
rug
because
nobody
is
asking
him
or
requiring
him
to
make
any
sort
of
decision
whatsoever
and
under
the
rug
it
sits
and
it
languishes
and
he
is
never
required
to
make
a
judgment.
now
did
i
make
a
mistake?
did
i
violate
the
law
and
what
should
i
do
about
it?
and
these
cases
become
much
harder
to
settle
quite
frankly,
five
and
six
and
seven
years
down
the
road,
when
there
is
a
substantial
back
pay
liability
involved,
then
they
are
if
you
hit
them
right
upfront.
now,
obviously
charging
parties
would
be
benefited,
charging
parties
now
have
their
charges
languishing
before
the
eeoc,
action
is
not
taken,
the
eeoc
goes
out,
they
have
a
charge
filed
by
an
individual
alleged
discriminee,
let's
say
a
racial
charge
at
first
the
eeoc
does
not
do
anything
about
it
and
then
it
does
go
out
to
conduct
an
investigation,
but
then
it
starts
investigating,
whether
there
is
religious
discrimination
or
sex
discrimination,
whatever
else
in
addition
to
the
particular
charge
of
racial
discrimination
or
minority
status
discrimination.
in
the
meantime
the
charging
party
sits
and
all
the
while
the
eeoc
does
not
issue
the
180
day
notice,
that
that
charging
party
has
a
right
to
sue.
so
he
is
not
or
she
is
not
pursuing
individual
rights.
it
is
a
very
unfair
system
to
charging
parties,
it
is
a
very
unfair
system
to
respondents
to
employers
and
it
is
a
terrible
system
and
so
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned
because
the
courts
are
being
clogged
with
stale,
time
consuming
cases
going
back
years
and
years
and
years.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
i
think
that
is
a
good
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
i
think
it
is
not
the
case,
i
really
do
believe
that
a
lawyer
confronted
with
a
deadline,
we
are
going
to
settle
this
case
in
30
days,
or
we
the
eeoc
will
file
a
suit.
you
have
got
no
choices
as
a
lawyer
for
your
client,
but
to
turn
to
look
at
that
case
and
make
a
judgment.
i
think
if
the
eeoc
pursued
it
is
responsibilities,
that
there
would
be
more
effective
conciliation
and
there
would
be
faster
action,
more
cases
would
be
settled
and
i
do
not
believe
the
courts
would
be
clogged.
but
even
assuming
arguendo,
that
they
were,
certainly
it
would
be
better
that
we
would
be
clogging
them
with
new
cases
than
cases
that
are
four
and
five
and
six
years
old.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
most
important
practical
points
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
you
have
made
a
mistake,
that
is
something
you
are
going
to
face
up
to
earlier,
much
more
readily
than
you
are
five
and
six
and
seven
years
down
the
road
and
this
is
the
problem,
you
do
not
make
those
judgments
now
because
nobody
is
holding
your
feet
to
the
fire.
now,
by
analogy
talking
about
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
a
moment,
it
of
course
has
a
different
a
cease-and-desist
type
authority
and
that
authority
was
denied
to
the
eeoc.
but
let's
take
an
example
of
two
employees,
side
by
side
working
at
machines
in
a
factory,
one
employee,
a
white
employee
is
discharged
for
union
activity,
the
other
employee
a
minority
is
discharged
because
of
his
race
or
ethnic
origin.
what
happens?
the
union
organizer
goes
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
he
files
a
charge.
within
a
median
time
of
43
days
the
investigation
is
completed.
the
charge
having
been
investigated
the
board
finding
merit,
a
complaint
is
filed.
a
hearing
is
held
before
an
administrative
law
judge.
the
administrative
law
judge’s
decision
goes
to
the
nlrb
in
washington,
court
enforcement
proceedings
are
begun
and
eventually
a
court
of
appeals
does
enforce
the
order
of
the
board
for
reinstatement
and
back
pay.
that
is
two-and-a-half
years
according
to
the
legislative
history
in
connection
with
these
amendments,
two-and-a-half
years
from
the
date
of
the
charge,
with
the
nlrb
to
the
final
decision
of
the
court.
now
the
proponents
of
the
court
enforcement
system
said,
that
was
too
long,
we
do
not
think
that
victims
of
discrimination
should
wait
for
two-and-a-half
years
to
receive
a
remedy,
we
want
a
faster
a
system.
that
is
why
they
rejected
the
cease-and-desist
system.
i
would
like
to
if
i
may
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
the
present
system?
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
yes,
the
present
system,
the
government’s
position,
yes
mr.
chief
justice
the
potential
contingent
liability
is
again
be
absolutely
staggering
and
often
one’s
which
you
cannot
measure,
you
do
not
know
the
duration
or
the
extent
of
them.
thank
you.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
yes,
chief
justice,
just
really
three
or
four
points.
on
this
point
of
claim
of
prejudice,
the
assistant
solicitor
general
takes
the
position
that
there
is
no
prejudice
here
to
petitioner
that
we
have
never
claimed
prejudice.
the
nature
of
a
statute
of
limitations
defends
of
course
that
prejudice
is
assumed,
need
not
to
be
proven,
we
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
laches
in
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
for
this
simple
reason,
but
latches
is
virtually
impossible
to
prove
by
way
of
summary
judgment
because
it
is
factually
oriented
and
there
will
be
substantial
differences
with
respect
to
material
fact,
therefore
latches
has
never
been
a
part
of
this
case
at
any
time
from
the
beginning
but
i
think
there
is
no
obligation
upon
us
to
prove
prejudice
in
order
to
prevail
in
this
matter.
i
think
that
mr.
justice
marshall
in
a
very
real
sense
put
his
finger
right
on
it,
when
he
referred
to
the
propensity
of
lawyers
to
put
off
until
tomorrow.
what
they
could
do
and
should
do
today,
now
i
do
not
think
we
lawyers
are
the
only
ones
guilty
of
that,
parkinson’s
law,
i
believe
was
something
to
effect
that
work
expands
so
as
to
fill
the
time
available
for
its
completion.
if
one
is
not
given
a
deadline
to
comply
with,
one
is
going
to
put
off
that
project
until
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow.
that
is
exactly
what
is
happening
here,
the
solicitor
general
says
that
there
are
90,000
new
cases
every
year
and
we
the
eeoc,
would
not
be
able
to
do
anything
with
them,
so
we
will
have
that
march
them
right
in
the
court.
well,
they
are
assuming
the
negative,
they
are
assuming
they
will
not
or
can
not
do
anything,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they
can
do
something,
they
can
investigate
those
charges,
they
can
conciliate
those
charges,
they
can
make
judgments
about
which
ones
to
take
to
court
and
they
can
make
judgments
about
which
ones
maybe
taken
to
court
justice
well
by
the
individual
private
parties.
after
all,
the
national
labor
relations
board
with
a
influx
of
cases
roughly
half
of
that
90000
figure,
about
45000
a
year
has
a
median
time
from
charge
to
completion
of
investigation
of
43
days.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
i
think
their
staff
is
somewhat
smaller
than
that
of
the
eeoc,
but
i
can
not
give
any
reliable
figures,
one
reason
mr.
chief
justice,
that
they
have
a
median
time
of
43
days
is
because
they
have
a
time
limit
internally
imposed
upon
themselves
of
45
days.
mr.
dennis
h.
vaughn
they
are
not
--
they
do
not
have
a
statutory
mandated
obligation,
they
do
however
come
to
a
charge
party
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
they
say,
we
are
going
to
file
a
complaint.
two
days
from
now,
unless
you
reinstate
these
employees
and
give
a
back
pay,
well,
that
is
a
form
of
conciliation
you
decide
right
away
what
you
are
going
to
do,
and
you
have
two
days
in
which
to
do
it
and
if
you
dont
reinstate
with
that
day
in
terms
the
complaint.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
