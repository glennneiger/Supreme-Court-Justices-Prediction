mr.
stephen
skillman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
subject
matter
of
this
appeal
is
the
disposal
of
solid
waste
in
new
jersey
and
elsewhere.
government,
in
the
discharge
of
its
responsibilities
to
provide
for
the
health,
welfare,
and
safety
of
its
people,
makes
provision
for
the
disposal
of
waste,
either
by
performing
the
service
itself
or
by
supervising
and
regulating
private
contractors
who
perform
the
service.
the
case
thus,
involves
the
performance
of
a
necessary
public
service.
it
is
also
clear
though
the
state
and
its
people
pay
a
social
cost
for
providing
this
public
service.
at
the
present
time,
the
only
viable
method
of
solid
waste
disposal,
with
a
few
exceptions,
is
through
landfills.
this
means
that
landfills
are
necessary.
however,
they
are
at
best
a
necessary
evil.
in
new
jersey,
virtually
all
landfills
will
produce
a
caliche,
which
is
a
highly
noxious
and
polluted
liquid
that
pollutes
both
ground
and
surface
waters.
landfills
also
generate
methane
gas
such
as
used
for
cooking.
thus,
fires
at
landfills
may
occur
even
decades
after
a
landfill
has
been
closed
out.
therefore,
the
disposal
of
waste
is
like
crime.
if
we
could
wish
away
the
problem
or
legislate
away
the
problem,
we
would.
but,
we
cannot.
we
cannot
simply
say,
no
more
waste
in
new
jersey.
we
have
to
take
care
of
the
problem
somehow.
provision
is
made
by
the
state
for
the
disposal
of
waste.
it
allows
the
use
of
its
land
for
this
purpose,
even
though
substantial
and
serious
harm
is
caused
to
the
land
and
to
the
environment
from
this
particular
form
of
land
use.
the
question
presented
by
this
appeal
is
whether
when
a
state,
such
as
new
jersey
authorizes
this
use
of
its
land
it
must
also,
under
the
commerce
clause,
make
available
the
use
of
its
land
to
other
states
and
their
political
subdivisions
for
this
same
purpose.
i
think
it
should
be
made
clear
at
the
outset
because
the
point
was
perhaps
somewhat
blurred
in
the
presentation
of
the
appellant
that
the
new
jersey
statute
being
considered
in
this
case,
taken
in
tandem
with
the
implementing
regulations
adapted
pursuant
thereto,
prohibits
solely
the
entry
into
new
jersey
of
solid
waste
intended
for
disposal
in
sanitary
landfills.
i
would
direct
the
court’s
particular
attention
to
page
96a
of
the
appendix,
which
is
a
regulation
adapted
by
the
state
commissioner
of
environmental
protection
to
become
effective
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
which
excludes
from
the
purview
of
the
prohibition
upon
entry
into
new
jersey,
solid
waste
which
is
intended
for
any
productive
use.
it
excludes
garbage
to
be
fed
to
swines.
it
excludes
solid
waste
to
be
processed
into
secondary
materials.
it
would
exclude,
for
example,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
automobile
hulks
and
the
analogy
between
this
case
and
the
hughes
case
decided
by
the
court
last
term.
under
subsection
c,
automobiles
hulks
are
reprocessed
and
as
were
the
facts
in
the
hughes
case,
then
assuming
that
70%
of
the
material
in
the
car
is
reprocessed,
which
is
i
understand
is
a
matter
of
industry
practice
is
the
fact,
then
that
reprocessing
would
fall
within
exception
c.
it
also
should
be
noted
that
the
parties
involved
in
this
case,
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
the
sanitary
landfill
operators
are
the
appellants,
are
engaged
solely
in
disposal
in
landfills
so
that
any
mention
of
recycling
or
automobile
hulks
and
so
forth,
(a)
is
not
within
this
case,
not
within
the
facts
of
this
case,
not
within
the
method
of
business
operation
of
the
appellants
and
(b)
is
especially
excluded
from
the
ban
by
the
implementing
regulation
adapted
by
the
new
jersey
commissioner
of
environmental
protection.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
my
recollection
of
the
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
that
is
also
the
practice
in
new
jersey.
for
example,
i
understand
that
there
is
a
very
large
automobile
reprocessing
plant
in
jersey
city,
which
is
close
by
to
new
york
city.
that
facility
receives
automobile
hulks
not
only
from
the
state
of
new
jersey,
but
also
from
new
york
city
and
that
reprocessing
operation
does
not
fall
within
the
statutory
ban
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case.
this
statutory
ban
taken
in
tandem
with
the
implementing
regulations
has
to
do
solely
with
disposal
in
landfills
putting
garbage
into
the
ground
with
all
the
intended
environmental
problems.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
all
wastes
originating
within
the
state.
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state,
we
are
fast
running
out
of
landfill
capacity.
until
we
reach
the
point
of
running
out
of
landfill
capacity,
i
do
not
think
it
makes
too
much
difference
in
terms
of
what
it
costs,
for
example,
to
put
garbage
into
the
ground
whether
there
is
additional
garbage
coming
from
new
york
city
or
not.
the
rates
charged
by
a
landfill
are
regulated
by
the
state
public
utility
commission
on
a
public
utility
rate-based
rate
of
return,
and
so
forth.
where
the
additional
cost
comes
in
is
when
we
reach
the
point
and
then
not
too
distant
future
where
our
landfill
capacity,
particularly
in
that
part
of
the
state,
is
simply
exhausted.
it
means
that
the
municipalities
and
others
producing
solid
waste
in
other
parts
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
rates
that
are
charged
by
the
landfills
to
the
collectors
are
regulated
by
the
state
public
utility
commission
since
1970,
your
honor,
on
a
rate-based,
rate
of
return
same
as
any
other
public
utility.
so
that
the
only
way
that
the
additional
cost
would
come
in
is
when
we
reach
the
point
where
all
landfill
capacity
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
is
exhausted,
which
seem
to
be
a
real
genuine
likelihood
at
this
point.
then,
if
the
people
in
the
northern
part
of
the
state
have
to
transport
their
waste
to
the
further
extremes
of
the
state,
out
of
the
western
new
jersey,
sussex
county
or
in
southern
new
jersey,
burlington
county,
then
that
additional
distance
of
transportation
to
that
limited
extent
there
would
be
an
additional
cost
at
that
point.
mr.
stephen
skillman
as
a
practical
matter,
we
cannot
do
that
because
of
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
stephen
skillman
pennsylvania
is
keeping
out
philadelphia.
pennsylvania
has
very
restrictive
legislation.
they
do
not
recognize
landfills
as
being
public
utilities,
and
any
municipality
in
pennsylvania,
which
wants
to
keep
out
waste
originating
in
another
municipality
can
do
that.
apparently,
the
great
majority
of
municipalities
immediately
surrounding
philadelphia
have
done
just
that
and
that
is
what
has
caused
philadelphia
to
come
over
to
new
jersey
which
has,
since
1970,
legislation
which
prohibits
municipalities
from
having
these
kinds
of
restrictive
policy.
so
in
sense,
we
are
the
victim
of
our
own
forward
looking
legislation
within
the
state.
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
it
is
not
mentioned
anywhere
in
the
briefs
and
it
just
came
to
my
attention
on
monday
and
was
confirmed
today
that
the
president
signed
only
12
days
ago
a
new
statute
dealing
with
solid
waste,
which
i
think
for
the
first
time
substantially,
i
do
not
know
how
substantially,
but
i
think
substantially
federalizes
the
subject
matter
of
solid
waste.
that
statute
is
entitled
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
of
1976
and
it
is
public
law
94-580.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
we
still
have
this
case,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
only
comes
in
very
indirectly
in
the
sense
that
there
had
been
parenthetical
references
at
least
in
the
briefs
to
federal
statutes
that
remotely
bear
on
the
matter
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
let
me
just
briefly
summarize
what
i
think
the
statute
does
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
at
a
disadvantage
of
having
only
come
across
the,
having
the
statute
brought
to
my
attention
the
first
time
on
monday
and
having
read
through
it
once.
what
it
does
is
confer
a
substantial
power
on
the
federal
environmental
protection
administrator
to
set
guidelines
for
the
states
in
formulation
of
regional
plans
for
solid
waste
recovery
and/or
disposal
and
it
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
states
to
formulate
regional
plans.
those
plans
may,
after
appropriate
consultation
and
cooperation
and
so
forth
between
the
governors
involved,
have
interstate
components
to
them.
now,
the
teeth
in
the
legislation,
i
should
not
say
that
it
compels
the
states
to
do
anything
because
this
is
a
carrot
rather
than
a
stick
type
of
piece
of
legislation.
the
carrot
is
if
the
states
want
federal
money
for
purposes
of
resource
recovery
capital
projects
and
other
solid
waste
activities,
they
must
have
plans
which
conform
with
the
federal
guidelines,
but
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
on
a
first
reading,
i
do
not
see
the
stick
in
the
legislation.
i
think
it
is
strictly
voluntary
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
it
does
have
some
relevance.
mr.
stephen
skillman
certainly,
it
has
relevance
in
the
sense
that
we
have
sought
throughout
this
litigation
to
draw
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
what
the
commerce
clause
standing
alone
and
without
congressional
legislation,
automatically
prohibits
and
what
congress
can
do
under
the
commerce
clause
if
it
perceives
a
social
problem,
which
it
impacts
in
some
fashion
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
have
built
out
that
the
congress
could
enact
such
legislation.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
have
any
doubt.
i
also
am
very
reluctant
to
make
too
many
representations
as
to
what
this
new
legislation
provides
having
just
the
benefit,
having
read
through
it
once.
mr.
stephen
skillman
october
21
was
the
date
it
was
signed
by
the
president.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
take
very
sharp
issue
with
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
problem
is
that
the
old
problem
of
one
word
having
many
meanings,
depending
upon
what
the
context
is.
i
have
no
doubt
that
solid
waste
or
the
service
of
providing
for
disposal
of
solid
waste
is
interstate
commerce
to
support
congressional
action,
antitrust
laws
in
the
pennsylvania
refuse
case
that
they
have
cited,
however,
that
does
not
mean
that
it
is
commerce
in
the
sense
that
it
falls
within
the
zone
of
free
trade
protected
by
the
commerce
clause
even
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
case,
your
honor.
it
sounds
like
it
maybe
similar
to
the
pennsylvania
refuse
case
that
has
been
relied
upon.
mr.
stephen
skillman
in
drawing
the
distinction
between
what
commerce
means
in
the
context
of
authorizing
congressional
action
and
what
it
means
in
the
context
of
what
it
prohibits
the
states
from
doing
even
in
absent
of
congressional
action.
the
court
has
developed
a
doctrine
of
what
they
call
illegitimate
items
of
commerce.
these
are
items
such
as
diseased
animals.
other
items
that
are
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
would
think
that
it
would.
mr.
stephen
skillman
absolutely,
not.
i
think
that
there
must
be,
certainly
a
party
who
wishes
to
challenge
such
a
characterization
by
a
state
legislature
has
the
right
to
do
so.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
we
start
off
i
think
with
a
presumption
that
the
legislative
characterization
is
an
accurate
one.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
the
basic
presumption.
then,
it
is
a
matter
of
the
attacking
party
developing
a
record
to
show
that
the
factual
premises
of
the
legislation
are
not
valid
premises.
mr.
stephen
skillman
and
also
prohibit
any
meat
from
within
the
state?
mr.
stephen
skillman
perhaps.
i
think
it
is
a
very
difficult,
very
philosophical
question.
i
think
that
the
issues
in
that
case
would
be
much
more
than
simply
commerce
clause
issues.
mr.
stephen
skillman
certainly
people
who
wish
to
eat
meat
would
have
some
arguments
i
am
sure,
but
i
do
not
think
they
would
be
issues
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
stephen
skillman
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
if
anyone
were
in
the
position
to
show
us
that
those
four
exceptions
listed
in
the
regulation
are
not
exhausted
of
the
types
of
things
one
can
do
with
waste
that
are
legitimate
and
productive,
we
could
certainly,
at
that
point,
adapt
further
exceptions
to
the
ban,
first
the
object
of
the
statute
is
disposal
in
landfills
and
only
that.
i
can
see
that
if
other
showings
could
be
made
that
for
example
some
recycling
process
was
helping
us
get
rid
of
waste
and
was
producing
an
article
of
commerce,
but
at
the
same
time
was
blowing
off
tremendous
amounts
of
air
pollution,
we
might
have
an
argument
there
also.
but,
that
is
just
not
what
the
present
state
regulators
need.
mr.
stephen
skillman
excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
skillman
certainly
a
landfill
has
value.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
a
landfill
is
valuable
for
its
intended
purpose,
which
is
the
disposal
of
waste,
valuable
for
that
part.
mr.
stephen
skillman
in
some
instances,
that
all
depends
on
what
the
other
alternatives
are
and
what
you
plan
to
do
with
the
land.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
it
maybe
filled,
but
it
is
not
necessarily
filled
with
garbage.
if
you
want
to
construct
something
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
some
of
the
garbage,
yes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
most
of
what
we
are
talking
about
is
garbage.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
is
garbage.
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
land
owner
receives
a
payment,
in
this
case,
from
the
city
of
philadelphia.
they
have
entered
into
long-term
contracts.
mr.
stephen
skillman
for
‘x’
number
of
tons
per
day.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
does
as
a
practical
matter
because
of
the
fact
that
you
cannot
just
dump
garbage
in
a
swamp.
the
whole
area
of
landfill
is
very
tightly
regulated
as
to
location,
for
example,
swamps
get
horrible
water.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct,
so
that
there
is
no
question
but
there
is
a
financial
transaction,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
under
the
clayson
case
and
the
quarantine,
diseased
animal
quarantine
cases
that
the
mere
fact
that
you
find
somebody
selling
is
somebody
a
service
can
actually
disposal
waste
or
something
does
not
mean
that
you
have
“legitimate
commerce”
that
falls
within
the
free
market
principles
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
sport
stadium,
this
is
an
interesting
point
and
i
think
comes
up
as
to
what
the
uses
of
the
garbage
in
terms
of
land
reclamation.
when
you
want
to
build
something
as
heavy
as
a
stadium,
what
they
had
to
do
was
come
in
and
take
all
the
garbage
off
that
land
and
move
it
elsewhere,
because
if
they
try
to
build
that
sports
stadium
on
top
of
a
landfill,
it
would
have
been
sagging
and
swaying.
in
other
words,
garbage
is
not
good
for
land
reclamation
unless
you
are
talking
about
a
light
use
such
as
a
golf
course,
it
is
the
classic
use.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
smells
better.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
environmental
interest
is
that
any
landfill
within
the
state
of
new
jersey
brings
about
environmental
harm
causes
caliche
to
develop
methane
gas,
fires.
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
but
if
we
add
philadelphia
waste
to
trenton
waste,
we
have
more
of
that
harm.
in
other
words,
we
have
to
do
something
with
our
own
waste.
we
cannot
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
apparently
is
one
city
in
western
new
jersey,
which
has
at
times
in
the
past,
and
we
are
not
even
sure
of
the
present,
but
see
it
is,
but
apparently
as
time
has
passed
it
has
used
a
disposal
site
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
but
essentially,
new
jersey
takes
care
of
its
own
waste
disposal
problems.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question
because
the
restrictions
of
the
restrictions
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
are
quite
different
from
the
statute
that
we
are
defending
here.
the
pennsylvania
legislative
scheme
permits
local
municipalities
to
keep
out
all
solid
waste
originating
outside
of
the
boundaries
of
the
municipality
including
waste
originating
in
other
pennsylvania
municipalities.
mr.
stephen
skillman
excuse
me?
and
including
that
originating
in
other
states
and
what
a
ruling
of
this
court,
affirming
the
trial
court,
what
impact
that
would
have
upon
such
a
statutory
scheme,
i
think
i
would
have
to
really
think
--
(inaudible)
exact
rationale?
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
it
might
be
relevant.
i
would
just
say
that
it
is
a
different
statutory
scheme
and
that
the
arguments
might
be
different.
mr.
stephen
skillman
for
the
most
part,
no.
i
think
that
the
most
relevant
factor
in
the
cost
of
disposal
is
distance.
i
suppose
for
an
individual
municipality,
if
they
can
find
some
disposal
site
across
a
state
boundary
that
is
closer
than
the
one
that
they
could
find
within
their
own
state,
then
under
those
particular
circumstances,
there
might
be
a
lesser
cost
in
going
across
the
state
line,
but
as
an
overall
general
matter,
i
think
my
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
have
any
doubt,
your
honor,
but
the
type
of
position
that
is
being
urged
by
pennsylvania
applied
philadelphia
here
is
one
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
long
range
best
interest
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
in
the
sense
that
you
do
not
get
true
regional
planning
by
a
party
in
the
position
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
just
going
out
in
the
marketplace
and
trying
to
find
somebody
and
paying
enough
money.
if
there
are
problems
where
we
need
regional
planning,
they
really
have
to
come
in
one
of
two
ways,
either
by
cooperative
action
between
the
states
or
by
regional
planning
under
the
auspices
of
the
federal
government.
it
is,
in
that
sense
i
suppose
that
we
come
back
to
the
recently
enacted
federal
legislation,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
not
the
free
open
economy.
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here
are
intergovernmental
relations.
because
that
is
the
nature
of
the
problem,
if
philadelphia
has
a
problem
at
all,
it
is
a
problem
that
is
not
susceptible
to
resolution
under
the
commerce
clause’s
negative
implications.
it
is
a
problem
that
has
to
be
dealt
with
by
governments
between
the
two
states
through
mutual
consultation
and
agreement
or
if
that
proves
unavailing,
then
pursuant
to
the
enactment
of
appropriate
legislation
like
congress.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
right.
there
is
a
middleman,
a
collector
from
the
private
home
in
some
instances.
in
other
instances,
the
municipality
made
the
collection
work
directly
itself
and
takes
it
to
the
disposal.
mr.
stephen
skillman
excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
one
i
told
you
about
was
the
price
charged
by
the
landfill
site
to
the
collector,
but
there
is
also
regulation
of
the
price
charged
by
the
collector
to
the
people
whose
waste
he
collects.
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
whole
industry
is
regulated.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
also
regulated.
it
is
regulated
at
both
steps,
at
both
the
collection
rate
and
the
disposal
rate.
thank
you.
