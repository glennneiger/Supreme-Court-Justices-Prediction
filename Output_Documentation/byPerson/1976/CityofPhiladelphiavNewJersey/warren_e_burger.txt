we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-1150,
city
of
philadelphia
against
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
moore.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
his
view
what
was
the
commerce,
the
substance
or
the
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
hear
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wondered
where
you
thought
he
rested
in
his
wage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
if
the
state
when
i
personally
processes
of
inquiry,
the
usual
legislative
inquiry
determine
that
in
a
given
number
of
years,
all
of
their
available
space
for
the
disposal
of
solid
wastes
would
be
used
up
and
that
at
the
rate,
the
state
itself
produce
that
waste,
that
they
could
not
say
we
are
going
to
save
the
new
jersey
space
for
new
jersey
waste
and
no
other
state
may
deposit
waste
here.
what
is
what
you
are
telling
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
equate
the
export
and
the
import
as
being
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
that
you
are
right
on
the
commerce
point,
mr.
moore,
is
there
any
economic
benefit
that
is
conferred
on
this
special
group
in
new
jersey
as
a
result
of
what
you
claim
is
discrimination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
them
carry
it
out
to
sea,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
then
that
it
is
new
jersey
industrial
disposers
who
are
the
economic
beneficiaries
of
the
new
jersey
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
discrimination
is
between
new
jersey
disposers
and
disposers
from
other
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
former
being
able
to
use
new
jersey
fills
and
the
latter
not
being
able
to
use
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
frequently,
in
some
of
these
commerce
cases
like
the
madison
milk
case
of
public
health
glosses
put
on
the
statute,
when
you
get
behind
it,
you
see
exactly
the
local
producers
they
have
got
behind
the
legislature
and
the
common
council
to
enact
it.
is
there
any
suggestion
here
that
new
jersey
industrial
disposers
played
an
active
part
in
getting
this
thing
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
were
literally
true,
you
still
say
that
the
commerce
clause
control
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
does
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
prevail
by
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
out
of
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
skillman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
alexandria
scrap
case,
the
very
movement
of
the
hulks
was
to
take
them
off
the
road
and
deliver
them
to
a
compressing
plant
which
compressed
them
and
sold
them
for
scrap
steels,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
it
was
not
something
that
was
to
be
disposed
of
by
burying
it
or
burning
it
or
otherwise
getting
rid
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
minute
left
council,
if
you
have
something
you
can
tell
us
in
a
minute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
not
talking
about
the
economic
and
really
the
political
realities.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice
