unknown
speaker
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
that
case
distinguish
that
case,did
they
not
say
that
their
congress
affirmatively
exercised
his
power,
whereas,
here
you
are
relying
simply
on
the
negative
implications
of
the
constitutional
provision?
unknown
speaker
mr.
moore.
unknown
speaker
did
congress
passed
a
statute
prohibiting
the
states
from
enacting
this
kind
of
legislation?
unknown
speaker
could
they?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
mr.
moore,
let
me
come
back
this
way,
could
philadelphia
and
the
city
of
new
york
make
a
deal
with
your
people
to
accept
untreated
sewage
from
those
cities?
unknown
speaker
those
regulations,
you
say,
are
valid?
unknown
speaker
one
last
question
and
i
will
stop.
you
would
not
read
the
new
jersey
statute
as,
in
effect
being
a
state
regulation
of
land
use?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
certainly
on
the
21st
amendment,
a
state
could
exclude
from
its
boarders
entirely
any
or
various
kinds
of
alcoholic
beverages
even
though
they
are,
of
course,
items
of
commerce?
unknown
speaker
well
part
of
the
21st
amendment
that
a
state
exclude
the
importation
into
its
territory
of
slot
machines,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
how
free
is
the
state
to
declare
by
legislative
fiat
that
an
item
is
intrinsically
evil?
unknown
speaker
how
free
is
a
state
to
do
it?
you
would
agree
that
they
could
do
it
with
respect
to
slot
machines?
could
they
do
it
with
respective
onions
or
potatoes?
unknown
speaker
the
law
excluding
from
importation
has
to
be
linked
with
a
law
that
prohibits
the
existence
in
the
state
as
a
product
or
as
a
possession
of
its
own
citizens
of
the
same
item.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
suggested
by
my
brother
mike’s
question.
a
state
can
lawfully
exclude
from
importation
into
the
state
slot
machines
if
and
only
if
it
prohibits
its
own
citizens
from
possessing
or
manufacturing
or
operating
slot
machines.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
part
of
your
case
if
this
discriminates?
unknown
speaker
the
economic
beneficiaries
and
these
are
the
professional
landfill
people,
the
people
who
specialize
in
disposing
of
waste?
they
are
among
the
beneficiaries.
unknown
speaker
although
professionals
do
not
benefit,
do
they?
they
are
prevented
from
handling
as
much
business
as
they
want.
unknown
speaker
the
available
places
in
new
jersey
are
reserved
for
them.
unknown
speaker
basically
out
of
state
companies
cannot
take
advantage
of
the
new
jersey
landfill.
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
have
a
pennsylvania
company?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
if
it
is
the
new
jersey
landfill
company,
if
it
is
dealing
in
new
jersey
solid
waste,
can
it
use
a
new
jersey
landfill?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
have
a
pennsylvania
disposal
company
that
wants
to
come
over
and
contract
with
a
new
jersey
industrialist
to
dispose
of
waste
in
new
jersey.
the
pennsylvania
company
can
do
that,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
question
interacted
about
the
non-availability
of
this
land?
for
example,
if
the
only
places
that
could
have
a
landfill
would
be
serviced
by
new
jersey,
could
new
jersey
say,
well
that
is
it,
we
cannot
let
anybody
else
into
it
we
do
not
have
woes
in
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
moore,
is
there
any
question
about
the
finality
of
the
judgment
from
which
you
are
appealing?
because,
this
case
does
go
back
for
trial?
unknown
speaker
did
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
you
are.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
order,
you
are
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
was
that
your
order,
the
one
that
dismissed
all
the
other
counts?
unknown
speaker
did
you
thereby
agree
to
deny
this
court
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
did
you?
unknown
speaker
to
deny
this
court
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
one
that
has
to
go
back?
unknown
speaker
now
nothing
goes
back.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
do
with
the
importation
of
waste
whose
destiny
is
that.
unknown
speaker
would
all
new
jersey
produce
wastes?
these
disposers
may
use
landfills
in
new
jersey,
or
all
new
jersey-produced
wastes?
unknown
speaker
to
that
extent,
i
gather
the
new
jersey
produces
the
waste
benefit
by
this
statute,
do
they
not?
if
they
had
difficulty
because
of
the
part
of
these
being
imported
in
from
philadelphia
in
disposing
of
theirs
they
now
have
less
difficulties
it
is
only
their
waste
may
be
picked
up
by
new
jersey
disposers.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
only
theoretical?
unknown
speaker
are
the
rates
that
disposers
have
to
pay
to
the
producers
regulated?
unknown
speaker
unless
it
is
closely
have
taken
over
to
pennsylvania.
unknown
speaker
pennsylvania
is
keeping
you
out
too?
unknown
speaker
do
you
rely
at
all
in
the
federal
statute
in
answering
the
commerce
argument
or
in
any
other
federal
statutes
as
expressed
they
leaving
them
out
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
the
question
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
were
it
in
effect
when
all
this
happen,
would
it
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
as
my
brother
white
suggested
say
anything
about
what
states
may
do
with
these
wastes?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
negative
say
a
state
has
awfully
said,
we
do
not
want
any
of
your
money,
what
is
the
negative
implication
from
the
federal
statute
that
is
up
to
the
state?
unknown
speaker
is
the
negative
implication,
if
the
state
does
not
want
federal
money
that
congress
intends
to
leave
the
matter
entirely
up
to
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well
then
it
has
some
relevance
here,
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
real
relevance
on
the
interstate
commerce
--
unknown
speaker
certainly.
your
rather
answer
to
question
by
my
brother
blackmun,
during
the
course
of
his
argument,
to
the
effect
that
he
thought
that
congress
could
not
legitimately,
under
its
commerce
power,
enact
legislation
that
would
affirmatively
prohibit
the
states
from
doing
what
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
done
in
this
case.
but
conversely,
it
suggested
i
think
that
in
its
recent
legislation
congress
has,
under
its
commerce
power
enacted
legislation,
which
would
seem
to
permit
the
states
to
do
what
new
jersey
has
done.
certainly,
congress
could
explicitly
enact
that
kind
of
legislation
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
doubt?
unknown
speaker
there
is
an
acted
one
so
that
was
signed
by
the
president
12
days
ago?
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
issue,
since
i
have
already
interrupted
you
with
the
appellant’s
basic
question,
basic
question,
basic
proposition
that
the
liquid
and
solid
waste
is
an
article
of
commerce?
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
that
came
from
los
angeles,
the
meat
driver’s
case
involving
commerce
in
greece
that
was
discarded
by
restaurants
in
los
angeles?
it
was
governed
antitrust
case
brought
to
breakup
an
alleged
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
in
greece
discarded
by
restaurants.
unknown
speaker
assumed
in
that
case
that
item
was
now
commerce,
it
was
then
sent
overseas,
i
remember
after
having
been
reprocessed.
unknown
speaker
they
are
all
contraband,
i
suppose
would
fall
in
that
category?
unknown
speaker
see
as
a
state,
do
define
contraband
can
it
define
potatoes
as
contraband?
unknown
speaker
and
what
would
the
criteria
be
to
measure
the
state’s
power?
unknown
speaker
right,
it
is
the
basic
presumption
of
constitutionality,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
let
us
say
you
had
a
majority
of
a
state
legislature,
who
are
vegetarians
and
they
just
prohibited
the
importation
of
any
meat
into
the
state.
it
would
be
very
reasonable
for
the
party
of
the
majority
of
the
legislature,
they
declared
all
meat
contraband,
would
they
have
a
power
constitutionally
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
due
process
is
another
issue.
unknown
speaker
when
you
were
discussing
administrative
order
#40,
you
cited
us
to
appendix
96.
i
took
it
that
you
were
telling
the
court
that
all
legitimate
commerce
is
protected
by
the
exceptions
that
are
listed
here.
is
that
substantially
what
you
were
saying?
unknown
speaker
if
there
are
any
other,
that
has
any
value
like
the
hulk
of
an
automobile,
like
garbage
that
can
be
fed
or
used
for
certain
fertilizer
or
whatever,
then
it
is
not
covered.
there
is
no
prohibition
of
that
kind
of
interstate
commerce.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
landfill
has
no
value?
unknown
speaker
the
landfill
has
no
value?
unknown
speaker
with
everything
that
you
got
up
there
and
know
that
it
has
a
little
value?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
also
to
fill
in
land?
unknown
speaker
that
part
of
the
city
is
filled
with
land
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
half
the
state
of
florida.
unknown
speaker
this
is
garbage.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
some
of
it
at
least,
you
feed
it
to
pigs.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
kind
of
refuse?
unknown
speaker
is
it?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
mechanics
of
this?
who
pays
what
to
whom
and
why,
in
this
landfill?
does
the
land
owner
make
the
payment
or
does
he
receive
a
payment?
how
does
this
work?
unknown
speaker
for
permitting
philadelphia
to
dump
its
refuse
on
the
land.
unknown
speaker
rather
than
the
land
owner
who
owns
a
swamp
paying
the
dealer
and
refuse
to
phili’s
swamp
land.
unknown
speaker
so
the
payment
in
this
case
goes
from
the
person
who
wants
to
dispose,
in
this
case
philadelphia
who
wants
to
dispose
of
its
refuse.
it
pays
the
land
owner
for
the
privilege
of
dumping
its
refuse
on
the
land
owner’s
land.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
getting
at
upstate
new
jersey
when
you
were
dealing
between
this
garbage
for
swine,
do
you
remember
up
there
we
had
a
trouble
with
the
swine
and
now
we
got
rid
of
that
and
we
got
a
sports
stadium.
what
was
the
difference?
we
are
allowed
to
have
the
garbage
for
swine.
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
when
you
drive
by,
it
smells
bad.
unknown
speaker
mr.
schillman,
could
i
just
get
a
very
simple
point
that
is
straight
in
my
mind?
the
city
of
philadelphia
may
have
a
contract
with
a
large
land
owner
within
new
jersey
to
dump
tons
and
tons
of
waste
on
that
land.
the
statute
of
it
required
cancellation
of
that
contract.
but,
it
would
permit
the
owner
of
that
land
to
enter
into
an
identical
contract
the
next
day
with
the
city.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
environmental
interest
being
served
in?
unknown
speaker
is
that
not
the
same
environmental
harm
from
trenton
waste
as
there
is
from
philadelphia
waste?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
that
all
waste
which
originates
in
new
jersey
is
deposited
in
new
jersey?
is
there
any
possibility
of
cross
hauling?
unknown
speaker
if
we
should
agree
with
the
trial
court
and
not
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
and
hold
the
statute
unconstitutional,
would
that
also
invalidate
the
various
pennsylvania
restrictions
that
you
say
now
prohibit
the
new
jersey
cities
from
dumping
in
pennsylvania?
unknown
speaker
including
other
states?
unknown
speaker
in
so
far
is
it
excluded
out
state
material,
it
would
be
quite
relevant,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
price
of
these
various
contracts,
price
per
ton
that
is
deposited
or
distance
hauled,
would
be
different
if
there
was
complete
freedom
to
go
across
state
lines
and
dumping
as
opposed
to
every
state
having
its
own
restriction?
do
you
think
this
could
have
any
impact
on
the
market
price
for
this
combination
of
commodity
and
service?
do
we
have
a
marketization
problem?
unknown
speaker
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
in
the
long
run,
the
smallest
state
might
be
better
off
in
greater
flexibility
as
to
where
it
could
dispose
of
this
material,
whereas
i
know
you
mentioned
new
jersey
may
exhaust
its
own
landfill
eventually,
unlikely,
pennsylvania
would
do
so
as
rapidly.
i
am
just
wondering
of
your
position
is
in
the
best
interest
in
the
long
run
of
your
client.
unknown
speaker
i
gather,
mr.
schillman
that
the
producer
of
these
wastes
in
new
jersey
does
not
have
something
to
sell,
they
have
something
let
us
get
rid
of.
they
pay
somebody
to
haul
it
away
for
them.
unknown
speaker
it
is
that
chapel
has
the
arrangements
with
the
owner
of
the
land
in
which
the
stuff
is
dumped,
or
he
maybe
the
owner
of
the
land
himself,
i
do
not
know.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
price
that
you
told
us
is
regulated?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
price
that
you
told
us
earlier
is
regulated
by
a
utility
type
commission?
unknown
speaker
no
one
is
getting
rid
of
it
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
service
or
if
chapel
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
waste
that
costs
him
something,
that
cost
is
regulated
by
the
commission.
