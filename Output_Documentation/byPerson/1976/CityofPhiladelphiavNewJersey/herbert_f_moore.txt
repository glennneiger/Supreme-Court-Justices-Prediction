mr.
herbert
f.
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
herbert
f.
moore
and
the
appellants
that
we
represent
are
two
municipal
corporations.
the
name
of
the
city
is
philadelphia
and
glen
cove
long
island,
three
rather
large
solid
waste
disposers
located
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
and
one
very
large
solid
waste
collector,
also
operating
out
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
the
purpose
of
our
being
here,
of
course,
is
to
test
the
constitutionality
against
the
commerce
clause
of
a
statute
enacted
in
new
jersey,
which
is
entitled
an
act
to
prohibit
any
person
from
bringing
into
the
state
any
solid
and
liquid
waste,
which
originated
or
was
collected
outside
of
the
state.
i
feel
compelled
to
explain,
before
i
proceed
into
the
legal
arguments,
some
peculiarities
of
the
present
posture
of
the
case
that
lands
at
a
certain
uniqueness.
that
is
that
we
started
this
out
in
the
superior
court
law
division
in
new
jersey
with
the
complaint
that
had,
i
think
close
to
20
counts,
all
of
which
were
constitutional
questions.
but
in
the
interest
of
efficiency
and
i
am
keeping
a
court
clawed
under
reasonably
unclawed,
we
proceeded
through
the
summary
judgment
procedure
on
an
issue
which
did
not
contain
any
disputed
facts
of
material
significance.
it
was
on
that
basis
that
judge
schad
(ph)
ruled
in
our
favor
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
the
grounds
that
are
discriminated
against
interstate
commerce.
and,
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
appeal
was
taken
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
the
appellant
division.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
believe,
your
honor,
it
was
both
the
substance
and
the
service.
he
relied
somewhat
on
the
cases
in
the
third
circuit
which
was
the
united
states
versus
the
pennsylvania
refuse
haulers
association,
which
was
a
case
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act
in
which
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
service
and
the
disposal
should
be
looked
at
together
as
a
unit
and
they
clearly
were
an
item
of
interstate
commerce.
then
i
believe
he
also
considered
the
substance
itself
as
an
item
called
commerce
because,
as
we
know
there
are
many,
many
items
of
solid
waste
that
are
traded,
sold,
and
used.
recently,
this
court
decided
the
case
of
hughes
versus
alexandria
which
dealt
with
automobile
hulk.
this
court
clearly
accepted
the
fact
that
automobile
hulks
were
legitimate
items
of
commerce.
does
that
answer
your
question,
sir?
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
okay.
i
think
your
question
was,
did
the
lower
court
consider
this
to
be
--
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
he
decided
that
on
the
basis,
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
statute
in
new
jersey
discriminated
against
interstate
commerce,
and
that
was
it.
the
other
court
in
the
companion
case,
which
was
decided
by
justice
souter
and
who
is
now
on
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
he
decided
that
on
the
same
basis,
that
it
was
a
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce
and,
therefore
must
full.
that
is
a
little
different
case
and
of
course,
we
were
not
involved
in
that
case.
that
was
a
totally
different
factual
situation.
now,
i
feel
it
is
extremely
important
that
we
keep
in
the
forth
most
of
our
mind
the
statute
of
new
jersey,
fortunately,
it
is
a
very
short
statute.
i
do
not
intend
to
read
it,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
aspects
of
it.
the
first
section
of
the
statute
is
a
legislative
finding
in
which
the
legislature
determines
that
there
has
been
a
large
volume
of
solid
waste
that
has
to
be
disposed
of,
both
in
new
jersey
and
out
of
state.
that
it
presents
a
threat
to
the
environment
and
appropriate
landfill
sites
are
being
rapidly
diminished
and
that
the
treatment
and
disposal
of
waste
collected
out
of
the
state
creates
a
public
health
safety
and
welfare
nuisance.
also,
it
is
against
it
and
it
absolutely
prohibits
the
treatment
and
disposal
within
new
jersey
of
all
waste
generated
out
of
the
state.
we
have
in
the
fining
clause
an
absolute
prohibition.
now,
when
we
get
to
the
actual
statute
itself
for
the
legislative
determination,
very
interestingly,
it
starts
off
with
“no
person
shall
bring
into
this
state
any
solid
or
liquid
waste
which
originated
or
was
collected
outside
of
the
state
except
garbage
to
be
fed
to
swine,”
which,
of
course
is
a
solid
waste
as
we
all
know.
“until
a
commissioner
shall
determine
that
such
action,”
and
the
action
obviously
has
to
go
back
to
the
bringing
in.
that
is
what
the
statute
is
talking
about,
“can
be
permitted
without
endangering
the
public
health.”
now,
we
have
approached
this
with
the
understanding
that
this
statute
paints
with
a
very,
very
broad
brush.
this
statute
is
not
directed
against
any
particular
type
of
disposal.
incidentally,
disposal
in
new
jersey
includes
treatment
and
processing
and
storage
of
solid
or
liquid
waste.
this
statute
deals
with
prohibiting
the
entry
into
the
state
any
item
that
travels
into
a
moment,
legitimately,
in
commerce.
that
is
designated
to
solid
or
liquid
waste.
now,
the
first
question
of
course
and
when
any
statute
that
is
tested
against
the
commerce
clause
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
in
fact
commerce.
because,
if
it
is
not
commerce,
we
are
not
in
the
ball
game
at
all.
now,
in
this
particular
incidence,
solid
and
liquid
waste,
as
i
have
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question,
i
pointed
out
that
automobile
hulks
are
obviously
a
solid
waste,
traditionally
and
historically
all
the
byproducts
of
industry,
many
of
them
have
commercial
value.
you
have
your
scrap
metals,
your
scrap
glass,
and
demolition
material,
and
many,
many
other
items
that
are
used
by
various
people
in
various
concerns
that
are
processed
and
treated,
all
of
which
are
prohibited
by
the
statute.
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
pennsylvania
refuse,
which
was
went
to
the
third
circuit,
and
i
believe
the
certiorari
was
denied
that
case
dealt
specifically
with,
actually,
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
it
was
the
movement
of
solid
waste
collected
in
pennsylvania
into
new
jersey
to
be
disposed
of
in
new
jersey.
the
question
came
up
because
the
refuse
haulers
were
being
charged
with
criminal
conspiracy.
the
question
came
up
that
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act
to
prosecute
these
collectors
because
we
are
engaged
in
dealing
with
a
worthless
commodity,
a
worthless
item
and
therefore,
it
is
not
of
any
commercial
value,
it
is
not
commerce.
of
course,
as
we
all
realize
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
depends
upon
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
they
came
up
with
that
type
of
reasoning
which
we
do
not
agree
with.
i
do
not
quite
fully
understand
it
because,
if
it
is
not
commerce
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
anything
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act,
then
it
is
not
commerce
for
any
purpose.
if
it
is
commerce
for
under
that
act
and
at
least
it
is
recognized
as
an
item
in
commerce.
now,
i
think
where
the
confusion
developed
perhaps
is
that
there
is
a
general
body
of
law
and
understanding
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
police
powers
of
states
and
they
are
dealing
with
public
health
questions,
this
court
and
the
constitution
has
gone
to
a
great
length
to
support
police
power
actions
in
the
public
domain
and
as
long
as
certain
tests
and
standards
are
met,
but,
to
say
that
automobile
hulks,
for
example,
was
not
commerce
is
just
not
a
truism.
you
have
another
aspect
of
this
which
is
also
very
interesting
and
very
important
and
that
the
people
who
are
disposing
in
new
jersey
at
the
present
time
of
solid
and
liquid
waste,
some
or
all
of
it
coming
from
out
of
state
are
private
enterprise,
they
are
public
utilities
as
legislated
by
the
state
of
new
jersey.
the
collectors
and
the
disposers
are
public
utilities.
they
are
dealing
in
a
legitimate
enterprise
and
they
are
depending
for
the
source
of
their
material
to
keep
them
in
a
commercial
business
items
that
flow
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
you
said,
did
they
or
could
they?
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
absolutely.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
believe
it
absolutely
would,
sir.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
in
effect,
i
am,
your
honor,
because,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
its
handling
of
the
case,
classified
landfills
as
natural
resources.
they
did
that
on
three
separate
occasions
in
their
opinion.
when
we
look
at
the
oklahoma
gas
cases
and
the
pennsylvania-west
virginia
gas
cases
where
the
states
are
saying
we
are
going
to
run
out
of
this
natural
resource
and
our
people
are
not
going
to
have
(inaudible)
for
their
homes
and
the
other
purpose
of
natural
gases
put
to.
we
are
going
to
curtail
the
exportation
of
this
natural
resource
to
protect
ourselves.
this
court,
very
clearly,
upheld
that
that
was
an
imposition
upon
interstate
commerce
and
the
famous
the
law
(ph)
and
that
have
been
awfully
quoted
that
we
sink
or
swim
together
in
this
country
and
the
northeast
would
keep
this
timber
and
etcetera.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
think
it
is
because
of
what
is
happening
here.
yes,
i
think,
very
differently,
it
is.
for
example
if
rca,
which
is
a
manufacturer
in
new
jersey,
if
new
jersey
in
order
to
increase
its
labor
market
and
increase
employment
rather
said
that
rca
can
only
use
transistors
that
are
manufactured
in
new
jersey
and
nobody
else
can
come
in,
now
obviously
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
interference
of
the
interstate
commerce.
that
is
what
is
happening
here.
but,
if
we
have
to
keep
going
back
to
the
statute
and
this
statute
goes
way
beyond
landfills.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no.the
states
unquestionably
have
the
right
to
regulate
items
that
are
inherently
dangerous
to
them.
new
jersey
has
adapted,
in
this
instance,
the
dep
regulations,
which
are
among
the
strictest
in
the
united
states
just
to
avoid
a
public
health
hazards.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
very
valid
and
in
our
appendix,
we
quote
from
an
affidavit
of
mr.
darnay
who
was
one
of
the
head
administrators
of
the
dep
in
washington
and
he
recognizes
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
can
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
solid
waste
management
plan,
which
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
took
judicial
notice
of
in
its
opinion,
that
solid
waste
management
plan
which
was
adapted
by
the
dep
in
new
jersey
says
on
page
2,
“there
is
no
technological
reason
why
we
cannot
dispose
of
solid
waste
with
minimal
environmental
harm.”
on
page
78,
it
said,
“the
bureau
of
solid
waste
management
still
has
chapter
8
of
the
state
sanitary
code
with
which
to
regulate
and
assure
nuisance-free
operation
of
disposal
sites
in
conformance
with
good
practice
and
health
standards.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no,
sir.
the
regulations
have
overtones
of
that
because
the
regulations
require
a
keeping
of
data
as
to
how
these
landfills
have
been
used
up.
in
talking
about
landfills
and
to
get
back
to
commercial
whether
it
is
an
item
of
commerce,
any
landfill
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
have
been
connected
with,
and
i
have
been
representing
these
people,
this
industry
for
good
18
or
20
years,
involves
land
that
has
no
real
market
value
which
really
marginal
and
sub-marginal
land
and
as
being
reclaimed
by
landfill
operations.
you
can
just
look
around
and
i
assume
that
judicial
notice
of
the
sport
complex
in
new
jersey,
which
they
had
announced
was
built
on
a
landfill.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
very
definitely,
sir.
in
our
society
today,
solid
waste
well,
not
being
an
exciting
subject
to
conversation
is
a
very
essential
one.
no
industry
can
exist,
or
commercial
enterprise,
can
exist
without
creating
solid
waste.
it
has
to
be
disposed
of
some
way,
either
burning
it
or
burying
it
or
putting
it
in
the
air,
those
are
the
only
three
places
you
can
dispose
of
anything.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
you
are
right.
well,
that
is
the
ocean,
i
am
sorry.
i
have
left
one
item
out.
you
are
absolutely
right,
chief
justice.
it
is
to
a
distinct
economic
advantage
to
industry
not
to
have
to
haul
too
far
their
waste
to
dispose
it.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
they
are
economic
beneficiaries.
i
am
not
saying
they
are
the
exclusive
economic
beneficiaries
of
new
jersey,
but
they
certainly
are
the
economic
beneficiaries,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
very
high
percentage
of
all
solid
waste
is
not
the
waste
that
you
and
i
think
of
when
we
think
of
garbage,
which
we
associate
with
because
we
have
homes
and
we
see
what
is
put
out.
that
is
the
putrescible
type
of
waste,
but
that
is
the
waste
that
they
are
feeding
to
swine.
there
is
a
clear
economic
discrimination
practically
there,
i
suppose.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
that
is
right.
when
i
say
philadelphia,
i
am
obviously
not
confining
it
to
the
municipal
government
because
all
the
commercial
activities
in
philadelphia,
industrial
activities,
many
of
them
use
the
philadelphia
collection
system,
and
so
there
is
some
of
them
have
their
own
trucks.
the
question
is
it
is
very,
very
costly
to
move
refuse
and
if
you
have
to
move
it
more
than
20
miles,
the
cost
escalate
very,
very
dramatically.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
made
a
comment
in
trying
to
belittle
that
type
of
point
saying
that,
we
would
only
cost
the
yonkers
i
think
it
was,
$5/ton
to
go
to
the
krypton
landfill
site,
which
is
in
new
york
state
someplace.
but,
when
you
think
of
$5
a
ton
and
multiply
that
against
the
tonnage
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
very
large
sums
of
money.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no
unfortunately,
i
do
no
think,
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
do
not
think
they
knew
anything
about
it.
i
know
how
the
statute
originated.
it
did
not
originate
that
way,
it
was
a
political
situation.
new
jersey
shall
be
a
garden
state
and
not
a
garbage
state
became
a
political
cry
of
some
politicians.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
absolutely,
sir.
i
think
the
controls
for
these
reasons,
whether
that
it
is
commerce
and
an
item
in
commerce
and
it
fits
within
that
definition
so
that
we
can
apply
the
commerce
clause,
i
assume,
or
have
we
got
beyond
that
point?
i
think
we
have
gotten
beyond
that
point.
i
think
i
have
satisfied
everyone
that
it
is
an
item
in
commerce.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
that
does
not
finish
the
argument
at
all.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no
way.
absolutely
right.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes,
though
i
guess
that
one
case,
was
it
bowman
versus
the
railroad
where
they
stopped
it,
but
i
think
that
was
before
that
amendment.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes.
once
you
define
and
make
a
determination
that
the
item
is
intrinsically
evil,
which,
was
never
done
here.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
they
have
done
it
many
times.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
they
can
do
it,
but
it
can
always
be
contested
because
it
has
got
to
be
reasonable.
they
cannot
make
an
arbitrary
determination.
absolutely.
sure,
in
a
lot
of
the
states
that
is
why
we
have
been
having
these
cases
over
the
years,
have
made
those
kind
of
determinations
to
protect
their
milk
and
their
shrimp
and
the
antique
case
that
has
been
recently
decided
by
this
court
in
which
justice
brennan
wrote
the
opinion
on.
that
was
the
type
of
situation.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
do
not
quite
follow
your
question.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
you
are
getting
into
dealing
with
a
matter
evenhandedly,
i
think,
which
is
the
uron-type
case.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
my
part
of
the
case
is
very
clearly
discriminates.
yes,
i
have
not
got
to
develop
those
points
yet,
but
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
get
into
next.
next,
we
have
to
consider
the
tests
that
have
been
developed.
i
guess
pike
versus
bruce
church
and
madison
are
the
cases
where
it
is
best
synthesized
and
brought
together
and
the
test
i
should
not
say
very
simply
because
it
is
not
that,
but
the
test
says,
of
course,
that
when
a
statute
regulates
evenhandedly
to
effectuate
a
legitimate
local
purpose
and
the
effects
have
appointed
in
interstate
commerce
are
incidental
to
the
statute
will
be
upheld,
unless
the
burden
is
excessive.
if
that
goes
on
to,
that
quotes
you
are
on
and
the
sites
you
are
on
at
that
point
in
the
opinion,
that
goes
on
to
say
that
if
the
legitimate
local
purpose
is
found,
then
the
extent
of
the
burden
is
going
to
be
waived
and
then
after
that,
we
are
going
to
look
into
a
couple
of
items.
one
is,
is
there
a
reasonable
alternative
available
that
would
have
a
lesser
effect
upon
interstate
commerce.
then,
we
come
to
the
madison
doctrine
which,
frankly,
i
am
not
exactly
too
sure
in
my
mind
how
it
fits
into
this
because
that
doctrine
says,
unless
there
is
a
non-discriminatory
alternative
available,
i
take
the
position
that,
in
this
case
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
legislature
of
new
jersey
clearly
has
not
treated
in
an
evenhanded
fashion
an
item
of
commerce.
it
has
said
that
this
item
of
commerce
is
going
to
be
discriminated
against
because
of
its
source
of
origination,
for
example,
whether
it
be
pennsylvania,
new
york,
or
delaware.
in
other
words
if
people
in
delaware
want
to
ship
an
automobile
hulks
into
new
jersey,
they
cannot
do
it.
that
is
a
point
of
discrimination
of
an
item
legitimately
in
commerce
as
to
its
source.
then,
they
said
to
the
people
part
of
the
enterprise
in
new
jersey
that
are
recognized
as
public
utilities,
they
said
to
them,
you
can
only
get
the
material
to
use
in
your
business
from
new
jersey.
you
cannot
import
it
from
out
of
state.
that
is
what
like
what
they
are
saying.
as
the
affidavits
fulfill
two
of
these
appellants,
virtually
their
entire
business
depends
upon
the
disposal
of
solid
waste
from
philadelphia,
which
incidentally
is
not
putrescible
waste,
the
putrescible
waste
from
philadelphia
goes
under
the
exception
to
the
pig
farms.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
they
are
among
the
beneficiaries.
they
are
benefit
plus
extensively,
at
least
new
jersey
tries
to
say,
“we
want
to
save
the
landfill
spaces.”
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
might
misunderstood
the
question,
i
am
very
sorry.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
this
is
private
enterprise.
they
can
go
out
as
long
as
it
is
zoned
properly.
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
--
.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
well
these
are
kind
of
new
jersey
company
that
collects
out
of
state,
one
of
this
does.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
well,
that
is
true,
but
it
cannot
go
into
pennsylvania.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
absolutely.
it
is
not
directed
at
that.
it
is
directed
at
the
entry
of
an
item
in
commerce.
it
does
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
disposed
in
a
landfill.
it
cannot
be
put
into
an
incinerator.
the
state
has
admitted
there
is
no
qualitative
difference
between
refuse
in
pennsylvania
and
refuse
in
new
jersey,
no
qualitative
difference
whatsoever.
yet,
does
it
make
sense
to
say
that
you
cannot
bring
waste
from
pennsylvania
into
new
jersey
and
put
it
into
an
incinerator?
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no,
unfortunately,
this
case
did
not
come
up
with
a
record
because
it
came
up
in
the
summary
fashion
on
those
points.
those
questions
which
should
have
been
developed
if
it
went
back
to
a
lower
court,
why
would
be
developed
by
proper
testimony.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes.
well,
we
were
forced
into
the
situation
which
i
explained
in
our
brief.
the
way
it
happened,
we
argued
the
matter
on
this
summary
judgment
position.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
as
you
know
from
the
opinion,
created
a
record
for
itself
by
taking
judicial
notice
of
certain
things.
i
immediately,
when
the
opinion
came
out,
went
to
see
the
chief
justice
of
new
jersey
and
mr.
schillman
came
with
me
and
pointed
out
that
there
were
many
other
matters
in
this
complaint
that
had
not
been
dealt
with
and
frankly,
they
were
a
little
surprised,
to
be
honest
with
you.
so,
they
gave
us
additional
time
to
develop
memorandum
on
those
points.
then
i
think
it
was
three
weeks
and
we
both
did.
then,
they
came
out
with
three
different
orders
which
are
in
the
appendix.
the
orders
has
said
that
you
can
go
back
without
any
restraints
and
we
would
not
retain
jurisdiction,
but
you
can
go
back
to
the
lower
court
to
see
if
there
is
any
other
appropriate
relief
available.
well,
after
the
way
the
supreme
court
has
wrote
this
opinion,
there
is
no
lower
court
judge
who
is
going
to
be
able
to
do
much.
an
order
was
entered
dismissing
all
the
other
counts
under
those
circumstances
and
this
was
the
final
judgment.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
think
i
am
running
out
of
time.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
it
was
an
order
that
was
entered
into
by
consent
by
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
we
agreed
to
--
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
we
agreed
to
do
what,
sir?
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no,
because
we
dismissed
all
the
other
counts.
all
the
other
counts
have
been
dismissed.
the
only
count
left
was
the
one
that
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
decided
on
and
that
is
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
no,
nothing
has
to
go
back.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
well,
we
have
asked
for
alternate
relief
on
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
we
have
barred
ourselves
by
dismissing
all
the
other
counts.
the
only
count
that
we
are
here
on
is
the
interstate
commerce
clause
question.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
alright.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
yes,
just
a
moment.
i
think
new
jersey
is
being
shortsighted
as
the
question
raised
in
this
type
of
legislation
because
it
is
possible
that
north
jersey
is
running
out
of
landfill
space.
upper
new
york
state
is
far
closer
to
new
jersey
for
disposal
of
solid
waste,
north
jersey
that
is,
then
south
jersey,
the
problem
in
cost
involved
which
absolutely
would
be
economically
unthinkable
to
haul
waste
from
bergen
county
down
to
burlington
county
with
the
congestion
in
new
jersey.
whereas,
it
could
be
much
cheaper
to
go
into
new
york
state
and
there
is
no
problem
into
going
into
new
york
state.
there
is
no
new
york
statute
that
says
we
cannot
go
in.
mr.
herbert
f.
moore
well,
the
question
that
was
raised
here
and
i
just
want
to
clarify
that
it
is
a
great
advantage
and
this
type
of
statute
does
seriously
interfere
with
the
commercial
future
for
new
jersey.
thank
you.
