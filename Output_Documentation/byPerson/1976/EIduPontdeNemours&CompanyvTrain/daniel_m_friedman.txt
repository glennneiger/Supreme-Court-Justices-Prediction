mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
this
court
pointed
out
last
term
in
the
california
case,
in
the
1972
amendments,
congress
made
a
rather
sharp
change
in
the
methods
for
dealing
with
the
serious
problems
this
country
faces
in
connection
with
water
pollution.
previously,
the
method
for
dealing
with
this
had
been
focused
on
achieving
certain
qualities
of
the
water,
that
is,
looking
to
the
end
product,
the
water,
and
trying
to
reduce
the
level
of
pollutants
in
it.
in
1972
amendments,
congress
shifted
from
that
primary
emphasis
to
an
emphasis
on
achieving
strict
effluent
limitations,
restrictions
on
the
amount
of
pollution
discharged
into
the
water.
it
further
imposed
very
strict
time
schedules:
1977
for
the
first
level,
1983
for
the
second
level,
with
the
hope,
the
ultimate
objective
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
goals,
that
by
1985
pollution
of
this
country’s
water
would
be
terminated.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
these
amendments
shows
a
clear
congressional
intent
that
this
required
the
establishment
of
uniform
effluent
limitations
on
a
national
basis.
the
theory
that
petitioners
urge
before
this
court
that
all
the
administrator
is
to
do
is
to
promulgate
general
guidelines
which
will
specify
ranges
of
permissible
pollution
that
will
detail
particular
factors
that
the
issuance
of
permits
are
to
consider
in
issuing
permits,
we
think
would
seriously
jeopardize
and
fraud
the
entire
congressional
plan.
instead
of
there
being
uniform
effluent
limitations
on
a
national
basis,
what
you
would
have
would
be
the
establishment
of
effluent
limitations
in
each
of
approximately
40,000
to
50,000
proceedings
looking
to
the
issuance
of
particular
permits.
as
i
will
explain
later,
we
do
not
suggest
that
these
effluent
limitations
of
the
administrator
are
to
be
mechanically
cranked
into
the
permits.
the
permit
issuers
are
not
to
be
mere
scriveners,
as
petitioners
described,
and
i
will
explain
the
states
will
have
a
very
major
role
in
issuing
permits
under
the
administrator’s
theory.
but
if
the
petitioners
are
correct,
if
that
is
all
the
administrator
can
do,
it
seems
to
us
it
will
fraud
the
basic
congressional
objectives
of
achieving
these
pollution
limitations
and
hopefully
termination
of
pollution
by
the
stated
dates,
which
can
only
be
achieved
through
uniform
national
standards.
it
is
going
to
be
very
difficult,
almost
impossible,
to
have
uniform
national
standards
if
each
of
the
dozens
of
permit
issuers
has
a
wide
variety
in
passing
on
the
application
of
these
rather
generalized
guidelines
to
particular
permits.
we
think
the
administrator’s
interpretation
that
he
does
have
authority
under
section
301
to
promulgate
binding
effluent
limitations,
an
interpretation
which
i
point
out
has
been
adopted
by
six
of
the
seven
courts
of
appeals
that
have
considered
the
problem,
does
effectuate
the
congressional
purpose
to
achieve
these
effluent
limitations
speedily.
we
think
this
is
precisely
what
congress
intended.
we
shall
argue
that
this
is
confirmed
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
by
the
scheme
of
the
statute
and
by
the
legislative
history,
and
it
represents
the
administrative
interpretation
of
the
statute
by,
in
the
language
in
udall
v.
tolman
of
the
officials
charged
with
setting
the
machinery
in
motion,
of
making
the
parts
work
effectively
and
smoothly
while
they
are
yet
untried
and
new,
and
that
kind
of
an
interpretation
is
one
to
which
the
courts
traditionally
give
great
deference.
in
last
term
in
the
california
case,
the
court
recognized
the
appropriateness
of
such
deference
in
interpreting
this
highly
complex
and
technical
statute.
and
i
will
shortly
in
my
argument
come
and
answer
the
contention
that
the
administrator’s
interpretation
first
appeared
shortly
before
the
regulations
were
issued.
it
is
our
submission
that
he
has
taken
this
position
that
he
is
going
to
act
under
both
301
and
304
from
the
outset
of
the
effectiveness
of
this
statute.
now,
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
a
number
of
the
statutory
provisions
which
we
think
show
that
congress
intended
the
administrator
to
have
this
authority.
many
of
them
are
very
technical
and
not
particularly
suitable
for
oral
presentation,
they
involve
cross-references
back
and
forth;
but
there
are
three
or
four
that
i'd
like
to
refer
to,
which
we
think
clearly
recognize
the
authority
of
the
administrator
to
promulgate
these
binding
effluent
limitations.
the
source
for
this
is
the
administrator’s
general
authority
under
section
501(a)
to
prescribe
such
regulations
as
are
necessary
to
carry
out
the
administrator's
functions
under
this
act.
now,
the
first
provision
to
which
we
refer
is
section
301(e),
and
we
have
filed
with
the
court
the
paper
edition
of
the
statute.
it
is
unfortunately
terribly
long
and
terribly
complicated,
but
i
will
refer
to
the
particular
pages
of
this
pocket
pamphlet
in
dealing
with
them.
this
is
at
page
30
of
statute,
section
301(e).
now,
what
it
states
is,
effluent
limitations
established
pursuant
to
this
section
or
section
302,
which
deals
with
water-quality
control,
shall
be
applied
to
all
point
sources
of
discharge
of
pollutants
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
act.
now,
it
speaks
of
effluent
limitations
established
pursuant
to
this
section,
but
the
permits
are
not
issued
pursuant
to
this
section;
the
permits
are
issued
pursuant
to
section
402,
and
it
seems
to
us
this
recognizes
that
something
other
than
an
effluent
limitation
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
30
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
subsection
(e),
the
last
subparagraph.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this,
it
seems
to
us,
indicates
that
what
is
being
spoken
about
here
in
effluent
limitations
established
pursuant
to
this
section
is
something
other
than
effluent
limitations
established
in
permits.
the
same
thing
is
true,
we
think,
with
respect
to
subsection
(c),
which
is
two
paragraphs
above
subsection
(e),
which
authorizes
the
administrator
to
modify
the
requirements
of
subsection
(b),
which
deals
with
the
effluent
limitations,
in
the
case
of
any
application
for
a
permit
filed
after
july
1,
1977.
well,
if
the
only
way
that
the
effluent
limitations
are
to
be
established
is
through
the
permits,
there
was
obviously
no
need
to
give
the
administrator
the
authority
to
waive
any
limitation.
this
again,
it
seems
to
us,
clearly
contemplates
that
there
will
be
established
effluent
limitations
separate
and
apart
from
the
permits.
now,
mr.
barnard
has
suggested
in
dealing
with
the
provision
in
section
501(b)(1),
which
is
set
out
at
page
77
of
the
statute,
that
when
the
statute
says
there
may
be
review
had
of
the
action
of
the
administrator
(e)
in
approving
or
promulgating
any
effluent
limitation
or
other
limitation
under
section
301,
302,
etcetera,
all
that
refers
to
is
his
action
in
granting
an
exemption
under
301(c).
well,
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
us
the
language
is
much
broader
than
that,
and
there
is
nothing
in
anything
of
the
history
of
this
suggesting
such
a
limitation.
but
that
argument
ignores
the
very
next
subsection
of
this
paragraph,
which
also
provides
for
review
of
the
administrator’s
action
in
issuing
or
denying
any
permit
under
section
402,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
only
way
that
effluent
limitations
were
to
be
established
was
through
permits,
there
would
be
no
need
for
these
two
paragraphs,
because
if
they
are
only
to
be
established
through
permits,
if
the
administrator
approves
a
modification
or
variance
from
an
effluent
limitation
or
particular
permit,
that
would
be
reviewable,
we
think,
under
section
402.
now,
there
is
one
other
provision
which
mr.
barnard
has
not
referred
to,
which
is
section
505
at
page
73
of
the
statute
and
it
goes
over
to
74.
that
provision
permits
citizen
suits
against
any
person
alleged
to
be
in
violation
of
an
effluent
standard
or
limitation
under
this
act
and
under
that
provision,
there
is
a
separate
section.
subsection
(f)
on
page
74,
which
defines
for
purposes
of
citizen
suits
what
these
terms
mean;
and
it
defines
effluent
limitation
to
include,
under
subparagraph
2,
an
effluent
limitation
or
other
limitation
under
section
301
or
302,
and
then
under
subsection
6,
a
permit
or
condition
thereof
issued
under
section
402.
so
once
again,
a
clear
recognition
that
there
are
two
different
animals
we
are
talking
about:
one
is
an
effluent
limitation
established
under
301
or
302,
the
other
is
a
permit
which
by
definition
also
will
contain
an
effluent
limitation,
since
it
specifies
the
precise
limits
of
discharge.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
what
he
tries
to
do
is
to
take
these
very
general
phrases
and
very
broad
terms
in
the
act
and
attempt
to
cut
them
down
and
try
to
give
them
a
very
limited
reading;
but
we
think
fairly
read,
the
whole
statutory
scheme
is
a
recognition
--
these
various
provisions
and
there
are
others
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
--
a
recognition
that,
in
fact,
congress
intended
the
administrator
to
be
able
to
prescribe
effluent
limitations
that
are
binding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say,
well,
what
requires
a
permit,
we
start
with
301(a),
which
says
except
in
compliance
with
this
section
and
sections
302
and
402
of
this
act,
the
discharge
of
any
pollutant
by
any
person
shall
be
unlawful.
it
requires
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
without
a
permit?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
402
requires
that
you
have
a
permit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
let
me
step
back
a
minute,
if
i
may.
301(a)
requires
among
other
things
compliance
with
402.
it
states
that
you
have
to
comply
with
a
group
of
sections
including
402,
and
402
provides
for
permits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
because
the
general
standard
does
not
specify
and
apply
the
precise
amount
of
discharge
that
a
particular
plant
can
make
in
terms
of
the
general
limitations.
let
me,
if
i
may,
give
a
specific
example
of
this.
for
example,
in
the
chlorine
subcategory,
there
are
specific
limitations;
you
can
discharge
a
certain
amount
of
a
particular
pollutant
for
each
thousand
pounds
that
you
produce.
now,
that's
the
effluent
limitation
is
formulated.
sometimes
it
is
in
terms
so
much
a
day,
so
much
a
month
and
so
on.
the
job
of
the
permit
issuer
and
the
reason
for
the
permit
is
to
specify
exactly
how
much
this
particular
plant
can
discharge,
and
that
is
something
more
than
just
a
mechanical
job.
it
is
not
just
cranking
them
in.
it
requires
a
number
of
calculations.
for
example,
frequently
it
is
unclear
precisely
which
subcategory
a
plant
fits
into.
a
plant
may
have
very
complicated
processes,
and
it
is
necessary
for
the
permit
issuer
to
study
the
thing
and
find
out
where
it
is.
sometimes,
for
example,
you
may
have
a
situation
where
one
of
the
standards
depends
upon
the
process
employed
at
the
plant.
you
may
have
a
plant
that
says,
well,
our
process
seems
to
be
this;
but
it
is
really
something
different.
that
is
another
thing
that
has
to
be
done.
just
as
important
is,
the
permit
is
the
place
where
the
schedules
of
compliance
are
set
forth;
that
is,
a
permit
not
only
tells
them
how
much
they
can
discharge,
but
sets
forth
specific
dates
by
which
they
are
to
achieve
and
be
along
the
way
to
accomplishing
the
limitations
of
1977
and
1983.
that
is,
it
will
say
by
such-and-such
a
date
in
1979,
you
have
to
have
completed
this
step.
it
takes
it
all,
it
takes
them
right
along
the
way,
it
tells
them
what
they
have
to
do
in
order
to
achieve
the
effluent
limitations
by
the
stated
dates.
another
thing,
the
permit
will
provide
various
things
with
respect
to
reports
that
have
to
be
made
and
studies
that
have
to
be
made
by
the
plant.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
don't
come
out
of
thin
air,
because
the
administrator
himself
has
promulgated
a
set
of
rather
detailed
guidelines
that
have
to
be
followed
by
every
state
that
is
authorized
to
have
its
own
permit
programs.
so
a
number
of
these
things,
such
as
the
monitoring
and
the
reporting
requirements,
are
set
forth
in
his
own
guidelines
for
the
permit
program.
in
addition,
some
of
them
do
come
out
of
the
guidelines.
for
example,
in
the
hypothetical
case
i
suggested
to
you
in
which
the
question
is
which
particular
process
is
employed
and
therefore
into
which
subcategory
the
plant
fits,
one
way
for
determining
that
would
be
to
look
at
these
lengthy
guidelines,
this
huge,
thick
document
which
is
filled
with
a
mass
of
technical
detail,
and
see
on
the
basis
of
that
what
were
the
factors
that
led
the
administrator
to
conclude
that
there
was
this
category
and
there
was
that
category,
and
on
the
basis
of
those
factors,
the
permit
issuer
would
seek
to
fit
it
into
the
category
that
the
permit
issuer
thinks
most
closely
approximates
that
guidelines.
i
want
to
stress
again,
because
of
what
mr.
barnard
has
said,
that
the
states
have
a
major
role
to
play
in
the
administration
of
this
permit
program.
they
are
not
just
sitting
there
and
saying,
okay,
here
is
this
permit;
let's
add
it
up
and
put
it
in
the
computer
and
comes
out
with
numbers
and
write
it
down.
it
is
a
very
complicated
process
to
issue
these
permits
to
decide
precisely
what
the
limitations
are,
to
set
the
schedules
of
compliance,
to
determine
exactly
what
can
be
done
and
to
determine,
among
other
things,
whether
the
plan
that
this
particular
company
has
proposed,
the
treatment
processes
it
intends
to
use,
will
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
guidelines
and
of
the
standards.
will
this
really
hold
out
promise
of
accomplishing
what
the
company
is
required
to
do?
now,
a
point
has
been
made
that
section
301
is
written
in
the
passive
tense
rather
than
in
the
active
tense,
and
from
that
one
should
imply
that
no
effluent
limitations
are
required
to
be
promulgated.
i
think
it
was
employed
in
the
passive
tense,
because
that
section
is
setting
out
the
standards
to
be
achieved.
it
has
formulated
the
effluent
limitations
that
are
to
be
achieved
by
certain
dates,
and
it
just
seems
as
a
matter
of
grammatical
construction
that
is
an
effective
way
to
put
it;
it
was
announcing
the
congressional
policy:
these
limitations
are
to
be
achieved
by
this
date.
but
that
does
not
indicate
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
give
the
administrator
the
authority
to
take
whatever
steps
he
felt
were
necessary
to
accomplish
that
objective.
now,
there
is
another
thing
about
this
statute.
there
are
number
of
provisions
dealing
with
various
types
of
enforcement.
permitting
citizen
suits,
permitting
the
administrator
to
go
into
the
district
court,
they
all
speak
of
enforcement
of
the
various
statutory
provisions
dealing
with
effluent
limitations.
you
enforce
301,
302,
307,
306
and
402.
at
no
point
is
there
any
reference
to
enforcement
of
the
guidelines.
the
guidelines
under
their
own
analysis
are
not
enforceable,
and
it
seems
to
us
totally
inconsistent
with
the
whole
statutory
scheme
to
say
that
congress
intended
to
enable
the
enforcement
of
the
limitations
in
all
of
these
other
sections;
but
when
you
came
to
the
most
vital
thing
of
all,
the
large
number
of
existing
sources
that
were
polluting,
nothing
could
be
done
with
respect
to
those
particular
sources
unless
and
until
the
general
guidelines
had
been
made
effective
as
to
each
source
through
a
permit.
indeed,
there's
no
question
has
been
raised
here
and
it
is
conceded
that
the
administrator
may
adopt
binding
effluent
limitations
for
these
other
categories
--
for
new
sources,
for
toxic
pollutants,
for
water-quality
standards
--
and
it
just
seems
so
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
give
him
that
authority,
at
the
same
time
denying
him
the
authority
to
promulgate
the
effective
type
of
effluent
limitations
where
it
was
most
needed
in
dealing
with
the
new
sources.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
why.
that
section
515
is
set
out
at
page
79
of
the
statute,
and
all
of
that
515
requires
is
that
the
administrator
more
than
180
days
before
publishing
a
proposed
rule
is
to
give
the
committee
notice
that
he
is
proposing
to
do
so.
he
is
not
to
submit
to
the
committee
the
draft
of
the
regulation;
all
it
says
is
to
give
notice.
in
this
case
they
did
in
fact,
they
went
beyond
that
and
gave
the
committee
the
draft
of
the
regulation;
but
all
the
committee
is
supposed
to
do
is
to
get
notice
and
then
within
120
days,
that
is,
90
days
before
the
regulations
are
to
be
published,
the
committee
is
to
report
and
give
the
administrator
its
views
on
how
to
deal
with
this
problem.
now,
the
guidelines
basically
will
set
forth
the
technology,
the
methods
of
dealing
with
the
problem,
the
impact
of
the
various
proposed
methods
of
reducing
effluent
pollution
upon
the
industry,
and
at
that
point
it
seems
to
us
is
the
place
where
the
expert
advice
of
the
committee
comes
into
play.
the
committee
gives
the
administrator
the
benefits
of
its
expert
judgment
on
how
best
to
deal
with
this
problem.
well,
that
is
the
point
at
which
the
expert
advice
is
needed.
once
that
has
been
done,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
the
administrator
once
again
to
come
back
to
the
committee
and
say,
okay,
these
are
the
guidelines
we
are
proposing;
now,
we'd
like
to
get
your
expert
views
on
whether
or
not
under
these
standards
the
effluent
limitation
for
this
particular
thing
should
be
1
pound
of
pollution
per
thousand
pounds
or
1½
pounds.
it
seems
to
us
the
critical
thing
and
the
reason
for
this
is
to
give
this
expert
committee
the
input
at
the
time
the
administrator
was
studying
the
problems
posed
by
the
technology,
the
chemical,
the
engineering
technology,
all
of
which
is
reflected
in
this
vast
document.
this
thing
is
just
a
mass
of
technicalities.
i
frankly
read
it,
skimmed
it
is
more
accurate;
i
could
not
understand
it.
but
someone
in
the
chemical
industry,
i'm
sure,
knows
exactly
what
this
means,
and
this
is
the
type
of
material
we
think
that
congress
intended
that
the
administrator
to
have
in
which
he
should
have
the
benefits
of
the
views
of
the
expert
groups.
now,
let
me
just
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wish
it
were
that
lucid,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
admit,
of
course,
this
statute
is
not
as
clear
as
it
could
be.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
think
the
clear
intendment
of
this
statute
and
the
purpose
of
this
statute
require
the
conclusion
that
the
administrator
does
have
this
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
you
have
to
consider
all
of
it,
i
mean,
i
think
the
language
support
this,
the
legislative
history
supports
this,
the
administrative
construction
supports
this,
the
consequences
of
their
interpretation
as
against
the
effect
of
our
interpretation
on
the
basic
policies
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
by
this
statute.
i
mean,
i
wish
the
statute
was
so
clear
that
there
was
no
room
for
disagreement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
course,
i
agree.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
statutory
scheme
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
would
have
less
authority
certainly
than
under
the
other.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
precisely
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
would
be
impossible
to
administer
in
the
sense
of
accomplishing
the
objectives,
that
is
our
position.
if
you
couldn't
accomplish
the
objectives
of
getting
on
with
this
and
really
stopping
this
pollution
of
the
nation’s
waters,
if
it
was
left
to
all
of
the
permit
issuers
just
to
apply
this.
and
i
might
add,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
any
case
where
an
application
for
a
permit
is
sought,
a
hearing
can
be
requested.
there
haven't
been
that
many
hearings
yet,
probably
because
of
the
view
that
the
permit
issuer
had
limited
authority.
but
if
the
permit
issuers
have
considerable
free
range
to
decide
within
ranges
and
to
decide
how
they
are
going
to
apply
the
particular
factors
to
the
particular
plant,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
just
going
to
be
more
and
more
hearings.
there
are
going
to
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
assume
it
would
be
a
very
serious
problem
if
everyone
requested
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
is
contemplated
by
the
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
it
would
affect
this
case
and
of
course,
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
you
are
dealing
with
the
existing
regulations
at
this
point
and
let
me
just
mention
this.
one
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
will
govern
permits
when
they
come
up
for
renewal.
most
permits
are
five
years,
and
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
being
issued
now,
yes,
coming
up
now.
but
most
of
them
have
been
issued
now,
most
of
them
now
have
been
issued.
there
is
close
to
50,000
permits
that
have
been
issued,
and
most
of
them
will
start
coming
up
in
two
or
three
years;
and
of
course
when
the
new
permits
come
up
for
issuance
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
well,
the
administrator
is
considering
those
regulations;
and
if
and
when
whatever
changes
he
may
make
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
revision
under
this
industry,
which
is
the
inorganic
chemicals-manufacturing
industry.
but
if
and
when
there
are
substantial
changes
in
those
regulations,
that
of
course
is
something
that
can
be
challenged
at
that
point.
we
don't
know
what
is
going
to
come
out
of
this
procedure.
we
have
no
way
of
crossing
that.
but
i
just
want
to
add
that
part
of
the
statutory
plan
is
that
the
administrator
will
be
constantly
re-examining
these
matters
to
take
advantage
of
new
technology.
and
the
way
under
the
statute
once
you
get
a
permit,
the
permit
is
deemed
compliance
with
the
statutory
requirements
for
the
period
of
the
permit,
so
that
during
the
normal
five-year
period
of
the
permit
you
are
not
in
violation
of
the
statute,
even
though
the
standards
have
been
significantly
changed.
but
as
technology
evolves,
as
knowledge
becomes
greater,
as
new
processes
are
developed,
the
administrator
will
be
able
to
change
the
regulations
to
require
that
as
the
permits
come
up
for
renewal,
the
plants
will
be
compelled
and
forced
to
adopt
the
more
advanced
technologies.
now,
i
would
like
to
come
to
something
on
which
mr.
barnard
has
repeatedly
been
pressing,
which
is
that
this
position
that
the
administrator
has
taken
now
that
he
has
authority
under
section
301
is
a
brand-new
notion,
that
this
only
came
into
being
a
couple
of
months
before
the
regulations
were
adopted;
that,
in
fact,
at
the
earlier
stage
the
administrator
never
dreamt
that
he
was
going
to
act
under
301.
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
5
--
that's
the
sort
of
pinkish
document
--
there
is
a
quotation
of
two
paragraphs.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
5.
quotation
of
two
paragraphs
from
something
that
the
administrator
issued
at
the
end
of
october
1972.
this
was
two
weeks
after
the
statute
was
enacted
and
this
was
a
directive
request
put
out
to
various
industrial
and
consulting
firms,
saying
the
administrator
would
like
them
to
submit
proposals
as
to
what
kind
of
studies
they
could
make
to
help
him
determine
these
guidelines
and
limitations.
and
mr.
barnard
quotes
and
italicizes
two
sections
of
this
statute,
and
it's
set
forth
at
page
6026
of
something
called
the
administrative
record,
which
is
a
vast
mass
of
material
that
is
on
file
with
the
court,
but
is
not
included
in
the
various
appendices.
i'm
not
sure
if
i
could
carry
it
out
physically.
i
know
there
is
more
than
can
be
handled
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
am
afraid
so,
mr.
justice.
now,
he
doesn't
italicize
the
first
sentence
of
that
material,
and
it
is
quite
understandable
because
what
the
first
sentence
says
is
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
amendments
requires
the
environmental
protection
agency
to
establish
effluent
limitations,
which
must
be
achieved
by
point
sources
of
discharges.
and
then
it
goes
on
in
the
next
sentence
and
specifies
the
source
of
that
requirement,
section
301
of
the
act.
now,
after
the
two
paragraphs
that
mr.
barnard
quotes,
there's
some
more
paragraphs
to
this,
and
i'd
like
to
read
two
more
sentences
to
the
court
which
mr.
barnard
has
not
quoted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
am
afraid,
mr.
justice,
they
are
at
page
6,026.
it
is
the
same
page
as
quoted
here;
but
it
is
not
included
in
the
brief,
and
if
the
court
wishes,
i
will
be
happy
to
make
available
this
particular
page.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
what
it
says
in
the
third
paragraph
of
this
is,
in
addition
to
his
responsibilities
under
section
301
and
304
of
the
act,
the
administrator
is
required
by
section
306
to
announce
standards
for
new
sources.
so
again,
a
recognition
early
on
that
he
had
responsibilities
under
301
and
304.
and
then
it
goes
on
in
the
next
paragraph,
the
third
sentence
of
the
next
paragraph
states,
effluent
limitations
guidelines
under
section
301
and
304
of
the
act,
and
new
standards
of
performance
under
306,
will
be
developed
for
27
industrial
categories.
so
two
weeks
after
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
administrator
had
already
taken
the
position
that
he
was
going
to
act
under
section
301
and
304.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
i
think
it
does
show.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it
does
show,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
at
that
early
stage,
he
recognized
that
he
was
going
to
do
something
under
301.
now,
their
argument
is,
he
can't
do
anything
under
301;
all
he
can
do
is
issue
the
guidelines
under
304,
and
then
it
is
up
to
the
permit
issuers
to
issue
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
in
the
6,000
pages
didn't
come
in
two
weeks
after
the
act.
that
6,000
pages
are
the
record
in
this
proceeding.
this
is
the
order
in
which
it
was
set
up
in
the
record
by
two
weeks
after
the
act,
we
didn't
already
have
6,000
pages
of
records.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
no,
no.
now,
there
was
a
reference
to
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
in
october
1973,
and
it
was
stated
that
all
that
was
done
in
that
document
was
merely
to
summarize
the
statutory
provisions.
but
if
one
looks
at
this
document,
there
are
specific
references
that
the
administrator
was
proposing
to
adopt
rules
pursuant
to
section
301,
304
and
the
rest
of
them.
i'd
like
to
specifically
refer
the
court
to
pages
of
the
appendix
--
that's
the
brown,
thick
document
in
this
case
--
at
page
61
of
the
appendix,
it
says
notice
is
hereby
given
that
effluent
limitations
guidelines
will
be
promulgated
for,
and
then
it
lists
all
of
the
subcategories
in
the
inorganic
and
chemicals-manufacturing
industry,
and
it
says
pursuant
to
sections
301,
304,
307,
etcetera.
then,
similar
reflections
contained
at
page
84,
where
there
is
a
reference
to
technology
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
last
paragraph,
technology-based
standards
as
detailed
in
section
301,
304(b)
and
306;
and
finally,
the
proposed
rulemaking
in
october
1973,
approximately
six
or
seven
months
before
the
regulations
finally
became
effective
and
approximately
one
year
after
the
statute
became
effective,
set
out
specific
numerical
effluent
limitations
for
these
industries.
i'd
just
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
page
110
of
the
appendix,
where
specific
numerical
amounts
are
given
in
connection
with
the
chlorine
subcategory
of
the
chemicals
industry.
so
it's
not
just
that
at
an
early
stage
the
administrator
indicated
he
was
proposing
to
act
under
301,
but
that
he
actually
that
early,
a
year
after
the
act
was
passed,
proposed
specific
limitations
and
gave
everybody
in
the
industry
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
them.
the
record
contains
a
number
of
objections
by
industry,
including
the
chemical
industry,
to
these
proposals,
including
the
complaint
that
they
shouldn't
specify
precise
numerical
limitations;
that
it
should
be
put
in
terms
of
range;
that
they
should
promulgate
guidelines;
and
various
factors.
and
we
think
that
this
does
reflect
a
consistent
administrative
interpretation,
that
here
is
a
case
and
a
complicated
statute
where
the
administrator
was
charged
with
setting
the
thing
in
motion,
early
on
concluded
that
he
should
deal
with
this
problem
of
section
301
and
304.
under
the
statute,
the
administrator
was
directed
to
promulgate
the
guidelines
within
one
year.
now,
this
proved
to
be
an
impossible
task.
just
the
sheer
magnitude
of
it,
the
studies
that
had
to
be
made
of
all
of
these
industries,
he
could
not
do
it.
and
what
he
did
rather
than
promulgate
first
guidelines
and
then
effluent
limitations
was,
he
combined
the
two
steps
into
a
single
proceeding,
and
at
the
end
of
this
proceeding
he
issued
virtually
simultaneously
the
guidelines,
the
actual
limitations
for
existing
sources
and
for
new
sources,
and
this
seemed
to
us
a
preeminently
practical
method
of
handling
it.
there
has
been
no
unfairness
to
the
petitioners,
they
were
on
full
notice
early
on
what
was
going
to
happen.
there's
no
indication
that
if
he
had
followed
separate
procedures,
anything
would
have
been
different.
they
knew
exactly
what
he
was
proposing
to
do.
they
had
full
opportunity
to
comment
on
it
twice,
because
the
administrator
here
followed
a
rather
unusual
procedure:
he
first
published
a
proposed
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
and
let
them
comment
on
that,
and
after
they
had
gotten
comments
on
that
then
he
put
out
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
then
he
got
comments
on
that,
and
finally
he
adopted
the
rules.
i
mean,
it
is
really
giving
them
more
procedural
protection
than
they
required.
the
argument
is
made
that
these
regulations
are
defective
because
they
do
not
provide
ranges
and
they
do
not
specify
the
various
factors
that
the
permit
issuer
is
to
take
into
account
really
in
applying
the
ranges
to
the
particular
plant.
that,
of
course,
is
just
another
way
of
arguing,
i
think,
that
the
administrator
can't
promulgate
binding
effluent
limitations.
i
add
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
speaks
about
ranges
at
all.
the
two
references
in
the
committee
report
to
ranges,
we
think
that
the
ranges,
to
the
extent
they
are
acquired,
are
provided
by
the
act
of
dividing
the
industries
into
subcategories
on
the
basis
of
particular
processes,
particular
plants,
particular
types
of
equipment
used.
and
for
example,
mr.
barnard
was
complaining
that
one
of
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
is
age,
and
he
said
that
age
of
a
plant
cannot
be
put
into
the
formulation
of
the
regulations.
well,
in
at
least
one
industry,
they
have
broken
down
on
the
basis
of
age;
in
the
electric-power
industry,
one
subcategory
is
new
plants,
and
another
subcategory
is
old
plants,
a
recognition
that
there
are
different
problems
in
controlling
pollution
in
different
types
of
plants.
now,
the
specification
of
factors,
we
think
that
that
requires
is
that
the
administrator’s
guidelines
specify
the
factors
that
are
to
be
applied
under
the
effluent
limitations
--
that
is,
on
what
basis
is
the
administrator
going
to
set
the
precise
numbers
--
and
that
we
think
is
precisely
what
he
has
done
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference,
mr.
justice,
because
these
permits
are
only
for
five
years,
and
when
the
permits
start
expiring
in
the
next
two
or
three
years
and
when
the
question
then
comes
how
should
they
be
changed
to
reflect
the
improvements
in
technology,
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
open
a
hornets'
nest
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
basic,
that
under
our
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suppose
they
may
not
be
heard
now
except
to
the
extent
--
i
don't
know,
i
haven't
thought
about
this
--
that
whether
the
invalidation
of
effluent
limitations
would
do
something
to
the
permits
that
have
been
issued.
it
may
be
that
if
the
permits
were
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suspect
not;
but
i'm
sure
an
attack
would
be
mounted
on
the
permits,
and
there
are
also
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it
is
only
the
guidelines
--
well,
that
again
would
depend
if
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that
is
open
to
them.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
productive
of
some
rather
extensive
and
difficult
litigation
if
that
happened,
because
i'm
sure
they
would
contend
that
somehow
the
permits,
even
though
in
compliance
with
the
guidelines,
if
they
were
issued
not
in
compliance
with
the
guidelines,
but
in
compliance
with
the
effluent
limitations,
and
if
the
effluent
limitations
are
invalid.
i
think
they
would
then
argue
that...
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
have
no
power
to
get
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suppose
so,
well,
they
make
the
argument
that
if
they
prevail
that
you
should
not
send
it
back
to
the
district
court,
that
you
should
allow
to
stand
the
portions
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
have
invalidated
some
of
the
regulations.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
in
addition
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
argue
pendent
jurisdiction,
which
we
say
that
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case
if
that
should
be
the
outcome,
it
would
be
sort
of
futile
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court,
which
would
undoubtedly
follow
the
views
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
in
the
meantime,
of
the
22
regulations
that
are
involved
in
this
case,
11
of
them
have
been
reversed
on
various
grounds
and
sent
back
to
epa
for
further
study,
and
those
are
at
the
present
time
in
the
course
of
study.
but
apart
from
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right,
because
there
is
no
pendent
jurisdiction,
then
the
entire
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
be
wiped
out;
and
then
it
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
but
the
district
court,
undoubtedly
seeing
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
done
to
this
case,
would
probably,
i
suspect,
follow
the
dictates
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
would
just
be
a
kind
of
a
futile
thing
to
go
back
and
forth.
now,
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
the
only
issues
before
this
court
are
the
authority
of
the
administrator
to
establish
these
binding
effluent
limitations
and
the
validity,
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment,
the
subject
to
our
cross-petition
of
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
has
to
be
a
variance
procedure
for
new
sources.
that's
the
only
thing
we
have
challenged.
there
is
no
question
before
this
court
of
any
of
the
modifications
or
revisions
requested
in
the
substantive
terms
of
the
regulations
themselves;
it
is
just
the
question
of
the
authority
and
power
of
the
administrator.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
of
great
practical
importance,
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
this
case
is
moot
or
inappropriate
for
us.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
it
is
of
terrible
importance,
because
apart
from
the
question
of
what
is
happening
to
the
existing
permits
is
the
fact
that
you
are
going
to
have
all
these
renewals.
it
is
critical
when
these
renewals
come
up
to
know
whether
the
administrator
can
establish
binding
limitations
or
whether
on
each
renewal
the
whole
thing
is
to
be
opened
up.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
most
of
them
are,
and
a
number
of
them
were
issued.
originally
a
fair
number
were
issued
by
the
administrator
prior
to
the
time
that
state-permit
programs
were
approved.
now,
only
27
states
now
have
approved
permit
programs.
so
for
the
other
states,
the
regional
administrators
have
been
delegated
by
the
administrator
the
authority
to
issue
permits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is.
indeed,
it
is
rather
interesting,
we
have
a
large
stock
of
amicus-curiae
briefs
in
this
case.
the
american
iron
and
steel
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
top,
yes.
this
is
just
a
massive
amount
of
stuff
here.
the
american
iron
and
steel
institute
has
a
lengthy
argument
as
to
why
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction.
the
america
paper
institute
says
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
american
petroleum
institute
says
it
accepts
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
one
amicus
brief
supporting
us,
the
natural
resources
defense
council,
says
the
jurisdiction
is
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so
there
is
a
division
even
within
the
industry
itself
as
to
jurisdiction
and
of
course,
except
for
the
eighth
circuit,
every
other
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
it
and
not
the
district
courts
have
jurisdiction.
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
a
number
of
excerpts
from
the
legislative
history,
which
we
think
confirm
that
congress
intended
to
permit
the
administrator
to
adopt
these
regulations.
i
am
not
going
to
go
through
them
at
any
length.
let
me
just
quote
one
or
two.
the
conference
report
and
the
differences
between
the
house
and
the
senate
bill,
which
we
have
quoted
at
page
60
of
our
brief,
said
that
the
conferees
intend
that
the
administrator
or
the
state,
as
the
case
may
be,
will
make
the
determination
of
the
economic
impact
of
an
effluent
limitation
on
the
basis
of
classes
and
categories
of
point
sources,
as
distinguished
from
a
plant-by-plant
determination.
clearly,
we
think,
contemplating
an
effluent
limitation
to
be
established
for
a
class
or
category
of
source.
and
then
in
the
house
bill,
quoted
at
the
top
of
page
63,
the
house
report
says
that
all
permits
issued
under
this
program
shall
be
consistent
with
the
specific
requirements
of
the
bill,
including
effluent
limitations
or
other
limitations.
once
again,
a
clear
reorganization
that
effluent
limitations
are
something
other
than
and
separate
from
the
provisions
in
the
permits.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
question
presented
in
our
cross-petition,
which
is
the
requirement
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
for
new
sources,
there
has
to
be
a
variance
procedure.
the
statute
in
section
306(b)
directs
the
administrator
to
establish
by
regulations
federal
standards
of
performance
for
new
sources
within
each
industrial
category,
and
the
standard
of
that
is
the
best
available
demonstrated
technology.
and
it
said,
including
where
practicable
a
standard
permitting
no
discharge
of
pollutants;
that
is,
congress
hoped
that
when
you
dealt
with
new
sources
as
distinguishably
from
existent
sources,
the
administrator
would
be
able
to
find
that
was
sufficient
available
technology
to
permit
no
discharge
at
all.
it
is
illegal
after
these
standards
of
performance
have
been
promulgated
for
any
new
source
to
operate
in
violation
of
the
standards.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
yes.
it
is
remanded
to
and
the
administrator
is
directed
at
pages
262
and
263
of
the
record
to
come
forward
with
some
limited
escape
mechanism
for
new
sources.
it
is
not
just
the
general
statement
that
there
should
be;
it
said
there
should
be
and,
the
administrator,
you
are
directed
to
provide
it.
it
told
the
administrator
to
work
out
some
scheme
whereby
new
sources
can
have
an
escape
mechanism.
if
this
decision
stands
on
the
remand,
he
has
got
to
come
with
some
variance
procedure
for
new
sources.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
both
under
the
statute
301(c)
for
the
1983
sources
and
under
the
administrator’s
regulations
for
the
1977
sources,
there
is
a
variance
provision.
the
court
recognized
also
that
there
was
no
comparable
thing
for
new
sources;
but
nevertheless,
it
concluded
that
a
variance
procedure
should
also
be
presumptively
applicable
--
i'm
sorry,
that
the
new-source
standards,
like
the
existing-source
standards,
would
be
presumptively
applicable
and
that
there
should
be
some
various
variance
provision.
this
rather
significantly
is
something
the
court
of
appeals
did
on
its
own.
the
petitioners
did
not
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
do
this;
the
court
did
it
itself.
and
we
challenge
that,
because
we
do
not
think
that
congress
ever
intended
there
to
be
a
variance
provision
for
new
sources.
we
think
the
reason
is,
there
is
a
basic
difference
between
getting
existing
sources
into
compliance
and
new
sources.
when
you
deal
with
an
existing
source,
turning
and
improving
it,
bringing
it
up
to
standards,
can
be
a
very
complicated,
time-consuming
and
expensive
procedure.
there
are
all
sorts
of
a
host
of
problems.
the
administrator,
when
he
dealt
with
the
existing
sources,
promulgated
the
limitations
on
a
basis
of
a
particular
subcategory,
and
inevitably
in
that
process
he
could
not
take
account
of
particular
problems
that
were
unique
to
a
particular
plant,
and
therefore
it
would
be
fundamentally
unfair
to
require
a
particular
plant
with
unique
problems
to
observe
the
general
effluent
standards
and
limitations
that
are
applied
to
all
members
of
this
sub-industrial
category;
and
for
that
reason
the
administrator
concluded
that
there
should
be
a
variance.
this
is
also
reflected
in
the
statutory
provision
for
a
variance
on
the
1983
sources.
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
new
plant,
it
seems
to
us
you
have
a
very
different
situation
facing
you.
to
begin
with,
by
definition,
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
plant
making
any
changes.
secondly,
the
new
plant
when
it
is
being
built
has
much
greater
freedom
to
adopt
new
technologies.
it
does
not
having
to
take
its
existing
operation
and
change
it;
it
is
starting
fresh,
and
it
is
not
only
more
feasible
and
not
only
better
able
to
do
this,
but
usually
likely
to
be
a
lot
cheaper.
the
standard
that
congress
directed
to
be
set
for
new
standards,
new
sources,
is
the
best
available
demonstrated
control
technology.
there
is
no
reason
why
if
a
plant
is
being
constructed
from
scratch
it
can't
comply
with
that.
this
is
the
best
way
to
control
pollution.
you've
got
a
tremendous
problem
in
getting
existing
sources
to
comply
and
to
cut
down
on
their
discharges
to
accomplish
the
achievement
of
these
objectives;
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
plant
that
has
not
been
constructed
with
a
new
source,
the
best
way
to
avoid
any
growth
of
pollution
is
to
make
sure
that
the
new
source
complies
with
these
strict
standards.
indeed,
the
hope
was
in
congress
that
in
the
case
of
new
sources
the
standard
would
be
no
discharge
at
all.
and
we
think
that
what
congress
contemplated
in
section
306
was
that
for
a
new
source,
unless
it
could
comply
with
these
strict
effluent
limitations,
it
should
not
be
built
at
all;
that
is,
congress
adopted
a
different
approach
when
it
was
dealing
with
correcting
existing
sources
and
permitting
new
sources.
now,
306,
with
its
very
explicit
thing
that
no
new
source
shall
operate
except
in
compliance
with
these
standards
is
in
sharp
contrast
with
some
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
which
do
explicitly
permit,
but
not
require,
the
administrator
to
grant
waivers.
reference
has
already
been
made
to
section
301(c)
with
the
waiver
of
the
permit
requirements.
section
316(a)
permits
the
administrator
to
waive
the
requirements
of
both
section
301
and
306
for
a
particular
plant
for
a
single
aspect
of
pollution,
so-called
thermal
pollution,
the
discharge
of
heat
into
the
waters,
if
he
finds
that
compliance
with
the
thermal-pollution
standard
is
unnecessary
to
protect
wildlife.
and
finally,
we
refer
to
section
313
of
the
act.
that
is
the
provision
requiring
federal
facilities
to
comply
with
all
of
the
standards,
and
that
section
permits
the
president
to
grant
a
one-year
waiver
from
any
of
the
requirements
of
state
and
federal
pollution
standards
if
he
determines
that
it
is
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states
for
any
federal
facility
to
have
such
a
waiver
except
that
he
cannot
even
do
that
with
respect
to
either
new-source
standards
under
306
or
toxic
pollutants
under
307,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
congress
did
not
even
permit
the
president
to
waive
compliance
with
the
new-source
standards
for
federal
facilities
when
he
was
able
to
conclude
it
was
in
the
paramount
interest
of
the
united
states
to
do
so,
it
certainly
did
not
intend
to
permit
the
administrator
to
do
this
in
the
case
of
new
sources
merely
because
they
said
they
could
not
really
comply
or
it
would
be
very
laborious
and
very
difficult
for
them
to
comply
with
the
existing
standards.
the
legislative
history
confirms
this
interpretation,
we
think,
in
the
committee
report
of
the
house,
which
we
have
cited
at
page
15
of
our
brief.
the
committee
list
is
one
of
the
two
most
significant
factors
in
the
attainment
of
clean
water,
and
i
quote,
"the
need
to
preclude
the
construction
of
new
sources
which
use
less
than
the
best
available
control
technology
for
the
reduction
or
elimination
of
the
discharge
of
pollutants",
and
the
words
"to
preclude
the
construction
of
new
sources
with
less
than
the
best
available
control
technology"
is
the
precise
standard
written
into
section
306
for
new
sources.
now,
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
the
jurisdictional
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
specific
standards
were
written
by
the
administrator.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
under
301,
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
cannot
answer
that
question,
mr.
justice;
but
i
will
be
happy
to
get
the
answer
and
furnish
it
to
you
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
do
not
know,
i
will
have
to
get
that
information,
mr.
justice,
and
forward
it
to
you.
now,
on
the
jurisdictional
question,
as
i
understand
now,
there
is
no
disagreement
between
us
and
the
petitioners
that
if
the
administrator
has
the
authority
which
we
say
he
has
and
which
he's
consistently
said
he
has
under
301,
they
concede
as
they
have
to,
first,
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
effluent
limitations
and,
second,
they
also
apparently
now
agree
that
as
an
incident
to
review
of
the
effluent
limitations,
the
guidelines
also
may
be
reviewed,
that
there
was
some
uncertainty
at
an
earlier
stage
of
litigation
precisely
what
their
argument
is.
now
as
i
understand,
their
argument
is
only
that
if
it
be
held
that
the
administrator
does
not
have
authority
under
section
301,
then
the
guidelines
standing
alone
are
to
be
reviewed
in
the
district
courts,
and
they
take
the
further
position
that
if
the
administrator
does
not
have
the
authority
under
section
301,
but
if
a
suit
has
been
brought
in
the
court
of
appeals
challenging
the
existing
new-source
standards,
which
by
definition
are
reviewable
only
in
the
court
of
appeals,
then
the
guidelines
somehow
can
come
in
under
pendant
jurisdiction.
it
is
a
very
involved
question.
we
hope
the
court
does
not
have
to
face
it,
of
course,
if
the
court
agrees
that
they
do
not.
if
the
court
should
reject
our
submission
on
this,
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
along
the
lines
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
that
even
if
it
were
to
hold
that
the
administrator
has
no
authority
under
301,
nevertheless,
the
close
relationship
between
the
301
standards
and
the
304
guidelines
would
make
it
appropriate
that
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
should
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
guidelines.
