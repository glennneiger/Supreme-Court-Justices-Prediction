mr.
robert
c.
barnard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
consolidated
cases
present
basic
statutory
issues
as
to
the
form
and
content
of
regulations
under
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
of
1972
for
existing
sources,
that
is,
existing
plants,
and
for
new
sources,
that
is,
new
plant.
the
regulations
under
which
these
issues
arise
concern
the
inorganic
chemical-manufacturing
industry.
petitions
in
no.
978
and
1483
present
the
issue
whether
the
regulations
by
epa
for
existing
plants
shall
be
guidelines
for
effluent
limitations
as
section
304(b)
expressly
commands
or
whether
epa,
relying
on
authority
said
to
be
derived
by
implication
from
section
301,
can
override
the
provisions
of
section
304
and
issue
effluent
limitations,
which
shall
be
mechanically
cranked
into
every
permit,
regardless
of
the
circumstances
or
the
conditions
of
the
plant
in
the
category.
the
resolution
of
these
statutory
issues
provides
the
basis
for
the
determination
of
a
jurisdictional
issue
which
is
also
present
in
these
cases.
the
question
presented
on
the
cross-petition
in
no.
1705
relates
to
the
issue
whether
epa’s
regulations
should,
as
the
court
below
held,
provide
a
safety-valve
procedure,
in
the
court’s
words,
enabling
an
individual
plant
to
show
that
it
is
entitled
to
a
variance
from
a
single-number
standard
because
of
the
special
circumstances
of
that
particular
plant.
there
is
no
jurisdictional
issue
on
1705.
the
statute
expressly
provides
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
source
standards.
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
of
1972
made
radical
changes
in
the
manner
in
which
both
municipal
and
private
plant
effluents
are
controlled.
the
court
in
the
last
term
in
the
california
case
had
occasion
to
consider
this
act
in
detail;
i
shall
therefore
merely
thumbnail-sketch
the
statutory
plan.
section
301
of
the
act
prohibits
all
discharges
by
plants
except
as
the
discharge
is
authorized
and
covered
by
a
permit.
section
301
states,
quote,
“to
carry
out
the
objectives
of
the
act,
there
shall
be
achieved,
by
1977,
effluent
limitations
for
point
sources
requiring
the
installation
of
best
practicable
control
technology
currently
available.
for
1983,
effluent
limitations
requiring
application
of
best
available
technology
economically
achievable.
section
301
expressly
provides
that
these
requirements
are
to
be
defined
and
determined
pursuant
to
regulations
under
section
304(b)
of
the
act.
the
primary
means
of
achieving
and
enforcing
the
effluent
limitation
is
a
permit
procedure
under
section
402,
where
the
regulations
are
applied
to
individual
plants.
the
regulatory
scheme
for
new
sources
is
similar,
but
has
important
differences.
section
306
of
the
act
directs
epa
to
establish
standards
of
performance,
not
guidelines,
for
new
sources
which
meet
the
statutory
technological
requirement
of
best
available
demonstrated
control
technology.
these
standards
are
also
applied
to
individual
plants
in
the
course
of
a
permit
process.
i
will
address
first
these
issues
as
concerned
regulations
for
existing
plants
and
the
jurisdictional
issue
that
is
related,
i
will
then
turn
to
the
issues
as
they
relate
to
new
sources
on
the
cross-petition.
before
discussing
these
matters,
perhaps
i
should
explain
what
appears
to
be
the
procedural
complexity
that
is
apparent
in
these
cases.
the
complexity
arises,
because
in
february
1974,
about
a
year-and-a-half
after
the
statute
was
passed,
epa
first
announced
its
position
that
it
had
implied
authority
to
issue
regulations
under
section
301
establishing
limitations.
the
regulations
in
the
form
of
single-number
limitations
would
be
issued,
epa
said,
under
both
sections
301
and
304(b).
at
the
same
time,
epa
announced
that
since
these
regulations
were
to
be
issued
under
301,
the
exclusive
review
provisions
of
section
509(b)
would
be
applicable
and
the
90-day
period
within
which
petitions
must
be
filed
would
be
equally
applicable.
petitioners
disagree
with
epa’s
view
that
it
has
implied
authority
to
issue
limitations
which
override
or
disregard
the
express
commands
in
section
304(b)
of
the
act.
we
likewise
disagree
with
epa
on
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
review
under
section
509;
however,
because
of
epa’s
announced
position,
petitioners
filed
protective
petitions
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
same
time
as
the
petitions
for
review
of
the
new-source
standards
for
file.
petitioners
also
filed
a
complaint
in
the
western
district
of
virginia,
challenging
certainty
of
the
inorganic
regulations
that
are
here
before
the
court.
the
appeal
from
the
district
court
was
consolidated
with
the
petitions
for
review
in
the
court
below.
the
two
proceedings
on
alternate
jurisdictional
bases,
the
complaint
in
the
district
court
and
the
petitions
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
are
both
before
this
court.
consequently,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
or
procedural
issue
which
stands
in
the
way
of
this
court’s
resolving
the
statutory
question
and
the
related
jurisdictional
problem.
with
the
procedural
complexity
out
of
the
way,
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
statutory
issue.
in
du
pont
ii,
the
court
below
characterized
the
statute
as,
quote,
“vague,
uncertain
and
inconsistent”
and
described
the
court’s
objective
as
somehow
making
epa’s
position
workable;
with
the
statute,
the
court
was
workable.
we
suggest
that
if
the
court
had
focused
more
on
the
words
of
the
statute
and
less
on
the
quasi-legislative
function
of
trying
to
make
epa’s
position
somehow
workable
with
the
statute,
it
would
have
found
the
statutory
plan
relatively
straightforward
and
non-complex.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
believe
a
court
should
consider
workability
obviously;
but
the
court
should
look
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
not
to
see
whether
it
can
accommodate
something
and
make
it
workable
in
my
suggestion.
and
the
words
of
the
statute
are
not
designed
to
make
something
workable;
the
words
of
the
statute
are
the
command
which
the
court
and
epa
should
follow.
and
i
will
turn
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
which
i
believe
demonstrates
that
the
court's
practical
considerations
disregard
the
words
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
suppose
it
could
happen
that
the
statute
could
be
determined
to
be
unworkable,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
situation
here
at
all.
section
301,
as
i
have
said
earlier,
subsection
(a)
forbids
all
discharges
unless
they
are
permitted
under
the
law.
subsection
(b)
lays
the
foundations
for
the
regulations
for
all
existing
sources.
to
carry
out
the
objectives
of
the
act,
the
subsection
says,
there
shall
be
achieved
by
1977
effluent
limitations
requiring
1977-level
technology
and,
by
1983,
effluent
limitations
requiring
1983-level
technology.
it
is
significant
that
section
301
is
written
in
the
passive
voice,
"objectives
to
be
achieved".
the
only
reference
to
regulations
is
the
specific
reference
to
regulations
under
section
304(b).
the
technological
requirements
are
to
be
defined
and
determined,
quote,
“in
accordance
with
regulations
issued
by
the
administrator
under
section
304(b)”.
304(b),
to
which
301
refers,
contains
the
direct
statutory
command
that
within
one
year
the
administrator
shall
publish
regulations
providing
guidelines
for
effluent
limitations;
and
section
304(b)
contains
detailed
instructions
as
to
what
is
to
go
into
the
regulations.
it
provides
that
the
regulations
shall
do
two
things:
first,
subsection
1a
and
2a
provide
that
the
administrator
shall
identify
in
specific
terms
the
degree
of
reduction
in
pollution
that
can
be
achieved
or
is
attainable
by
the
application
of
1977-level
technology
in
one
case
and
1983
technology
in
the
other.
this
is
to
be
accomplished
for
classes
and
categories
of
point
sources.
second,
subsections
1b
and
2b
direct
how
the
regulations
are
to
be
applied
to
plants
within
the
classes
or
categories.
the
regulations
shall
specify
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
control
measures
applicable
to
point
sources
within
the
classes
or
categories.
the
statutory
command
is
even
more
concrete,
because
it
lists
the
factors
which
are
to
be
specified
in
the
regulations
and
to
be
taken
into
account
in
framing
permits
under
section
402.
epa
asserts
that
if
permit
officers
are
to
apply
the
factors
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
sir.
section
402(d)
refers
to
guidelines,
but
there
is
not
a
specific
cross-reference,
yes,
your
honor.
epa
says
that
if
the
permit
officers
are
to
apply
the
factors,
this
will
lead
to
wholesale
reconsideration
of
the
factors
in
the
permit
process.
we
believe
epa's
assertion
confuses
the
role
as
to
the
factors
and
epa’s
role
and
the
permit
officers'
role.
obviously,
epa
must
consider
the
factors
in
specifying
them
in
the
regulations.
the
permit
officer
uses
epa’s
explication
of
the
factors
as
the
basis
for
applying,
not
reconsidering,
the
factors.
the
congressional
intent
that
these
factors
to
be
specified
by
epa
would
be
used
by
a
permit
officer
in
the
permit
process
is
indicated
by
the
fact,
which
the
court
below
noted,
that
a
number
of
the
factors
such
as
age
of
the
plant
are
really
relevant
or
applicable
only
to
a
particular
plant.
one
of
the
clearest
confirmations
of
the
congressional
intent
that
this
was
the
pattern
to
be
followed
is
found
in
the
conference
report.
the
paragraph
quoted
in
page
55
of
our
brief
and
discussed
at
length
in
all
of
the
briefs.
the
report
referring
to
section
304(b)
records
the
congressional
intent
that
the
limitations
within
a
category
are
to
be
precise
in
order
that
the
limitations
will
be
as
uniform
as
possible.
epa
focused
sharply
on
the
word
"uniform"
and
disregards
the
explanation
in
the
report
that
uniformity
does
not
mean
identity.
to
the
contrary,
the
report
explains
what
congress
meant.
similar
point
sources,
congress
said,
with
similar
characteristics
would
be
subject
to
similar
limitations.
it
is
precisely
this
similar
treatment
which
section
304(b)
is
designed
to
accomplish.
when
the
factors
are
specified
in
the
regulations,
an
officer
will
be
able
to
select
in
the
permit
process
limitations
for
plants
which
have
similar
characteristics
with
the
result
that
they
will
be
treated
similarly.
this
is
true
uniformity.
section
301
of
the
act
says
the
objectives
to
be
achieved
are
effluent
limitations
requiring
1977-
or
'83-level
technology.
the
definition
of
"effluent
limitations"
is
instructive.
section
502-11
says
that
"effluent
limitations"
means
"a
restriction
on
discharges
from
point
sources
established
by
a
state
or
epa,
including
schedules
of
compliance".
a
state
clearly
cannot
establish
effluent
limitations
except
in
a
permit,
and
a
schedule
of
compliance
obviously
relates
to
an
individual
permit.
indeed,
it
was
epa’s
effort
to
change
the
definition
in
the
regulations,
subsection
11(i)
of
the
general
provisions.
by
deleting
the
references
to
restrictions
established
by
a
state
and
by
deleting
a
reference
to
the
schedules
of
compliance,
which
led
the
court
below
to
set
epa’s
definition
aside.
the
regulations
before
the
court
are
entitled,
quote,
“effluent
limitations
guidelines
for
the
inorganic
chemical-manufacturing
industry".
the
term
"effluent
limitations
guidelines"
is
not
a
statutory
term;
but
it
is
defined
in
epa’s
general
regulations,
subsection
(j).
subsection
(j)
provides,
quote,
“the
term
'effluent
limitations
guidelines'
means
any
effluent
limitations
guidelines
issued
by
the
administrator
pursuant
to
section
304(b)
of
the
act".
epa’s
brief
does
not
refer
to
this
definition,
nor
to
the
fact
that
the
general
provisions
nowhere
speak
of
regulations
under
section
301
of
the
act.
the
definition
in
the
general
provisions
is,
in
fact,
a
confirmation
of
the
announcement
that
epa
made
in
1983
in
what
it
called
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking,
and
it
referred
there
to
effluent
limitations
guidelines,
standards
of
performance
pursuant
to
304(b)
of
the
act
and
306
of
the
act.
the
announced
purpose
of
the
notice
was
to
facilitate
comment
on
rules
to
be
published
under
section
304(b)
and
section
306;
no
reference
to
regulations
under
section
301.
when
the
proposed
inorganic
regulations
were
published
in
october
1973,
the
preamble
expressly
stated
with
respect
to
existing
plans,
quote,
“the
regulations
propose
herein
set
forth
effluent
limitations
guidelines
pursuant
to
section
304(b)
of
the
act”;
again,
not
a
word
about
301
regulations.
when
the
final
inorganic
regulations
were
published
in
march
1974,
the
preamble
referred
back
to
the
proposed
regulations
for
the
statement
of
the
legal
bases.
epa
now
asserts
that
in
both
the
proposed
and
the
final
regulations,
it
gave
notice
that
the
regulations
were
issued
under
section
301.
section
301
was
paraphrased
in
both
the
notice
in
1973
and
in
the
preamble
to
the
proposed
regulations.
the
preamble
to
the
final
regulations
contains
the
statement
that
the
regulations
were
issued
pursuant
to
sections
301,
304,
306
and
307.
but
at
the
same
time,
it
refers
back
to
the
proposed
regulations
for
the
statement
of
legal
bases
for
the
regulations,
which
was
section
304(b).
the
final
regulations
also
incorporate
the
general
provisions,
which
define
effluent
limitations
guidelines
to
be
304(b)
regulations.
the
assertions
in
epa’s
brief
that
301
was
cited
as
the
authority,
i
think
will
not
withstand
examination
of
the
record.
at
most,
it
is
an
acknowledgment
by
epa
that
301
and
304
are
related,
because
301
directs
that
regulations
shall
be
issued
under
304,
and
304
directs
that
effluent
guideline
limitations
shall
be
issued.
we
suggest
that
the
specific
words
"effluent
limitations
guidelines"
as
they
are
defined
in
the
general
provisions
and
the
words
in
the
preamble
to
both
the
proposed
and
final
inorganic
regulations
confirm
epa’s
contemporaneous
interpretation
at
this
act
that
its
job
was
to
issue
regulations
in
conformity
with
section
304(b)'s
commands
and
that
that
is
what
it
said
it
intended
to
issue.
epa
has
now
virtually
abandoned
its
february
1974
contention
that
the
regulations
are
issued
under
both
301
and
304.
epa
now
says
that
regulations
should
be
issued
under
section
304(b).
it
acknowledges
that
no
such
regulations
have
been
issued,
and
i
believe
the
word
it
used
is
"formally".
it
now
asserts
that
it
has
complied
with
the
substance
of
section
304(b)
by
issuing
a
voluminous
development
document
and
economic
report,
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
that
in
just
a
moment.
epa
now
argues
that
it
has
authority
to
issue
single-number
limitations
by
regulations
to
be
cranked
into
a
permit
by
rote
and
that
this
authority
is
derived
by
implication
from
section
301.
it
asserts
an
administrative
convenience
as
the
basis
for
this
decision
and
a
fear
of
laxity
by
the
states.
we
suggest
that
epa
is
wrong
both
on
policy
and
on
legal
grounds
in
this
position.
on
policy
grounds,
congress
specifically
decided
that
the
major
responsibility
for
controlling
pollution
within
a
state
shall
fall
upon
the
state.
this
policy
is
confirmed
expressly
in
section
101
of
the
act.
section
402,
which
sets
up
the
permit
system,
provides
for
transfer
of
the
administration
of
the
permits
to
the
states
as
soon
as
they
satisfy
certain
conditions
of
the
statute,
and
26
states
i
believe
have
now
satisfied
those
conditions.
epa’s
decision
to
issue
single-number
limitations
because
of
some
fear
of
state
laxity
reduces
the
states
to
the
role
of
a
scrivener.
whatever
epa’s
fears
amount
to,
and
we
submit
that
they
are
baseless
because
of
the
statutory
provisions
for
review,
this
reduction
of
the
role
of
the
state
is
in
contravention
of
congress's
intention
that
the
state
shall
have
a
major
role
in
control
and
administration
of
pollution
regulations
within
their
states.
to
understand
how
epa's
power-by-implication
position
does
violence
to
the
statute,
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
a
little
bit
and
look
at
the
statutory
plan
again.
section
304,
as
i
said,
mandates
that
epa
shall
issue
regulations
for
effluent
guidelines,
which
shall
identify
by
categories
the
degree
of
reduction
attainable
by
application
of
1977
or
1983
technology
and
shall
specify
the
factors
applicable
in
determining
control
measures
for
particular
point
sources
within
the
classes
and
categories.
the
statute
lists
the
factors
to
be
specified;
these
include
age
of
facilities,
process
employed,
engineering
aspects
of
the
application
of
the
control
technology,
non-water-quality
considerations,
specifically
energy
requirements,
and
cost
benefit
for
1977
and
process
changes
for
1983.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
and
particularly
the
senate
report,
made
clear
that
what
congress
was
thinking
about
was
the
enormous
variety
of
existing
plants
and
that
they
wanted
guideline
regulations
that
would
contain
ranges
of
numbers
for
each
category
and
a
specification
to
guide
the
permit
authorities
in
selecting
the
appropriate
number
in
the
range.
in
our
brief,
we
have
used
the
word
"flexibility"
in
describing
regulations
which
comply
with
the
command
of
section
304(b).
"flexibility"
in
this
context
means
only
that
the
permit
will
be
tailored
to
the
particular
situation
of
that
particular
plant
in
light
of
the
factors.
it
does
not
mean
that
either
the
regulations
or
the
permit
officer
can
deviate
from
the
technological
requirement
in
section
301,
application
of
best
practical
control
technology
for
1977
and
best
available
for
1983.
"flexibility"
means
that
the
permit
officer
will
be
guided
by
the
regulations
in
selecting
the
control
technology
or
control
measures
for
a
particular
plant
which
meets
the
respective
1977
and
1983
requirement
rather
than
force-fit
a
single-number
limitation
on
a
plant
regardless
of
its
special
circumstances.
this
we
think
is
exactly
what
the
congress
meant
when
it
said
in
the
conference
report
similar
plants
with
similar
characteristics
shall
be
subject
to
similar
limitations.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
those
words
are
reasonably
clear,
your
honor.
number
1,
so
far
as
approving
is
concerned,
that
word
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
statute
that
as
originally
passed
required
epa
to
approve
each
state-issued
permit
before
it
became
valid.
the
approving
language
enabled
that
action
by
the
administrator
to
be
reviewed
in
the
federal
courts.
the
limitations
language
in
there
clearly
refers
in
our
view
to
section
301(c),
which
authorizes
the
administrator
to
deviate
from
the
requirements
of
1983
upon
a
specific
point
as
set
forth
in
section
301(c).
in
order
to
have
that
reviewed,
the
language
had
to
be
in
the
statute
dealing
with
limitations
under
section
301.
epa
assigns
no
meaning
to
the
word
"approving"
as
it
appears
in
that
section,
and
indeed
if
epa’s
construction
is
correct
it
refers
to
limitations
under
section
306,
then
the
limitations
words
in
subsection
(f)
are
actually
a
duplication
or
render
subsection
(a),
which
deals
with
new-source
matters,
without
purpose
or
without
effect.
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
that
provides
no
authority
for
the
kind
of
general
limitations
that
epa
has
issued
which
override
the
commands
the
section
304(b).
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
promulgating
effluent
limitation
under
section
301(c),
your
honor.
301
(c)
provides
that
the
administrator
may
vary
the
requirements
of
the
1983
level,
and
the
requirements
of
the
1983
level
are
set
out
in
subsection
(b),
which
directs
that
it
shall
be
determined
pursuant
to
regulations
under
section
304(b).
in
order
to
review
those
limitations,
the
statute
had
to
provide
for
this
kind
of
a
review.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
statute
requires
a
finding,
which
would
make
it
difficult
except
to
make
a
finding
in
terms
of
a
relatively
specific
plant;
but
it
is
conceivable
that
a
finding
could
be
made
for
more
than
one.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
it
talks
about
any
plant
and
it
requires
a
specific
showing
with
respect
to
that
plant,
both
technological
and
economic.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
say
that
with
respect
to
the
word
"promulgating";
with
respect
to
the
word
"approving",
i
suggested
that
it
has
a
broader
purpose
of
providing
for
review
in
the
federal
courts
of
actions
by
the
administrator
in
approving
permits
that
are
issued
by
the
states.
epa’s
position
in
reality
using
its
implied
authority
is
an
attempt
to
amend
the
statute
and
change
the
statutory
plan.
section
304(b)
says
that
the
factors
to
be
specified
are
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
control
measures
applicable
to
point
sources
within
the
classes.
epa
now
says
under
its
implied
authority,
it
may
issue
single-number
limitations
to
be
mechanically
put
into
permit
for
the
plant
and
that
it
can
disregard
the
statutory
command
in
section
304(b)
to
specify
the
factors
which
will
guide
the
permit
officers.
in
effect,
this
is
a
repeal
pro
tanto
of
section
304(b)
by
a
power
said
to
be
implied
in
section
301.
epa
places
great
reliance
on
section
301(c),
which
was
just
referred
to,
section
301(c)
authorizes
the
administrator
to
modify
the
requirements
of
subsection
(b)(2)(a),
which
is
the
1983
step,
on
a
factual
and
economic
showing.
but
the
section
speaks
of
requirements;
it
is
does
not
speak
of
limitations
to
be
issued
under
the
section
301.
the
requirements
specified
here
are
that
the
effluent
limitations
which
require
the
application
of
the
technology
as
determined
by
regulations
under
section
304.
that
is
what
the
section
is
speaking
of.
the
section
was
designed
to
permit
the
administrator
not
to
provide
variances,
but
actually
to
provide
a
deviation
from
the
1983
technological
standard.
without
that
authority,
he
could
not
have
provided
a
deviation
based
on
the
findings
that
the
statute
speaks
of.
section
301(d),
which
epa
does
not
mention
in
its
brief,
like
section
301(c),
also
contains
a
specific
cross-reference
to
the
procedure
standard
to
be
explicated
by
regulations
under
section
304(b).
section
301(d)
provides
for
review
every
five
years
of
any
limitation
required
under
paragraph
(b)(2);
that
is
the
1983
step.
the
procedure
for
the
review
of
the
limitations
is
carefully
identified.
the
revision
is
to
be
pursuant
to
the
procedure
set
out
in
paragraph
(b)(2).
this
cross-reference
is
to
the
procedure
set
out
in
paragraph
(b)(2),
which
is
regulations
under
section
304(b).
the
legislative
history
confirms
that
this
section
was
designed
to
deal
with
the
period
after
1983.
the
permits
normally
lasts
five
years;
they
need
to
be
renewed.
the
statute
provides
for
1977
and
1983
technological
requirements.
beyond
that,
we're
to
move
toward
no
discharge.
this
section
contemplates
that
as
the
permits
come
up
for
renewal
on
a
five-year
term,
they
will
be
renewed
subject
to
the
regulations
under
304(b)
which
are
then
in
effect.
in
short,
the
most
up-to-date
regulations
will
be
applicable
to
those
permits
as
they
are
reviewed.
epa
now
acknowledges
that
there
should
be
regulations
under
section
304(b).
it
asserts
that
the
lengthy
development
document
and
economic
report
comply
in
substance
with
the
mandate
of
section
304(b).
there
are
two
basic
objections
to
this.
304(b)
directs
that
regulations
providing
guidelines
for
effluent
limitations
shall
be
issued,
not
discursive
documents
that
have
no
legal
effect.
secondly,
these
documents
perform
none
of
the
functions
of
guideline
regulations,
because
they
provide
no
guidance
to
permit
officers.
epa
says
it
has
issued
limitations
which
must
be
cranked
into
the
permit,
there
is
no
guidance
to
the
officer
except
to
crank
them
into
the
permit.
epa
makes
four
additional,
and
i
suggest
non-consistent,
arguments
on
the
matter
of
the
form
and
content
of
the
regulations.
in
the
preamble,
epa
says
that
section
304(b)
provides
for
guidelines
to
implement
the
standards
of
section
301,
all
by
itself
an
interesting
term.
congress
thus
recognized,
epa
says,
that
“some
flexibility”
was
necessary
to
take
into
account
the
complexity
of
the
industrial
world.
to
achieve
that
flexibility,
epa
put
into
the
regulations
for
each
subcategory
a
standard
clause
authorizing
the
administrator
to
grant
a
modification
of
the
single-number
limitation
upon
a
showing
that
the
factors
applicable
to
a
particular
plant
are
fundamentally
different
from
those
considered
by
the
administrator.
this
provision,
epa
says,
provides
the
flexibility
which
the
statute
contemplated.
three
courts
have
disagreed:
the
court
below,
the
third
circuit
and
the
district
court
in
the
grant-processing
case.
the
second
circuit
held
that
without
some
variance
provision,
the
scheme
of
limitations
could
well
founder
on
the
rock
of
illegality;
but
it
postponed
the
decision
as
to
the
validity
of
the
particular
variance
clause
to
the
facts
of
a
particular
case.
we
suggest
that
this
narrow
variance
clause
should
not
be
debated
for
the
reason
that
it
is
surplusage.
moreover,
in
august
1974,
epa
announced
that
it
was
rethinking
the
variance
clause
and
asked
for
public
comment
on
the
variance
clause.
epa
has
not
revealed
the
result
of
that
re-examination.
epa
is
correct
in
our
view
that
the
congress
did
intend
some
flexibility;
indeed
it
went
further:
it
specifically
provided
for
the
flexibility.
if
epa
had
complied
with
section
304(b)
by
specifying
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
limitations
of
the
permit,
there
would
be
no
need
to
device
a
narrow
variance
clause.
the
stature
itself
determines
specific
terms,
the
flexibility
which
congress
said
was
permissible
in
that
section
304(b).
secondly,
epa
said
it
considered
the
factors
in
setting
up
the
subcategories
in
these
regulations
and
that
the
factors
justified
no
further
sub-categorization.
the
issue
is
not
further
sub-categorization,
but
whether
epa
can
ride
roughshod
over
the
command
in
section
304(b)
that
it
specify
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
control
measures
for
plants
within
a
category
or
class.
third,
epa
says
that
its
regulations
provided
ranges,
because
different
limitations
have
been
fixed
for
different
subcategories.
but
the
fact
that
there
are
different
numbers
for
different
categories
does
not
create
a
range
as
congress
contemplated,
as
the
third
circuit
correctly
pointed
out.
a
range
made
up
of
different
numbers
in
different
subcategories
is
no
guidance
to
a
permit
officer
in
determining
control
measures
for
a
plant
within
a
single
category.
a
limitation
applicable
to
a
plant
manufacturing
sodium
silicate
in
the
sodium-silicate
subcategory
is
not
relevant
in
any
way
in
determining
the
limitation
for
a
plant
manufacturing
titanium
dioxide
in
the
titanium-dioxide
subcategory.
fourth,
epa
also
takes
the
position
that
there
is
an
implicit
range
in
each
subcategory
from
the
specific
limitation
number
down
to
zero.
but
this
range
is,
as
the
third
circuit
again
we
think
correctly
held,
is
an
illusion.
no
factors
are
specified
to
enable
a
permit
officer
to
select
the
number
within
this,
"range".
more
basically,
the
record
does
not
provide
any
support
for
a
number
down
to
zero
when
the
number
epa
selected
based
on
the
record
is
a
number
above
zero.
finally,
epa
says
that
there
is
great
administrative
convenience
in
having
single-number
limitations,
it
is
easier
to
administer,
and
it
refers
to
the
use
of
the
word
"uniform"
in
the
conference
report.
whatever
the
administrative
convenience
is
concerned,
it
cannot
override
the
commands
of
section
304,
as
explained
in
the
conference
report
that
similar
plants
with
similar
characteristics
shall
be
subject
to
similar
limitations.
this
emphasis
by
congress
on
the
similarity
of
treatment
is
easily
understood.
when
congress
was
developing
the
1972
act,
epa
was
well
along
in
developing
the
so-called
permit
program
under
the
refuse
act.
congress
was
well-aware
of
the
fact
that
epa
had
prepared
what
are
called
guidance
documents.
these
guidance
documents
recognize
the
range
of
plants
in
the
industry
and
establish
ranges
of
parameters
by
subcategories.
some
of
the
guidance
documents
actually
refer
to
the
factors;
others,
the
inorganic's
guidance
document,
says
that
epa
will
provide
a
technical
briefing
so
that
the
permit
officers
will
understand
how
the
factors
are
to
be
applied
in
the
course
of
issuing
permits.
and
it
is
this
same
regulatory
pattern
which
we
believe
the
congress
had
in
its
mind
when
it
adopted
section
304(b)
providing
for
guidelines.
indeed,
the
regulatory
pattern
continued
after
the
act
was
passed.
to
assist
the
permit
officers
in
the
interval
before
new
regulations
were
issued,
epa
in
may
1973
directed
that
the
guidance
documents
would
be
used
by
the
officers
in
permits,
“until
effluent
guidelines
are
promulgated
under
section
304”.
this
reference
to
effluent
guidelines
under
304
and
the
character
of
the
guidance
documents
themselves
are
further
confirmation
of
the
contemporaneous
construction
epa
gave
to
this
statute.
now,
this
pattern
was
abruptly
changed
in
february
1974,
when
assistant
administrator
kirk's
memorandum
was
made
public,
the
memorandum
that
announced
the
new
theory
that
the
regulations
would
provide
limitations
in
reliance
on
implied
authority
under
section
301.
this
about-face
by
the
administration
in
the
midst
of
the
regulatory
process
demonstrates
that
there
has
been
no
consistent
administrative
interpretation
to
which
this
court
should
defer.
to
the
contrary,
such
about-face
means,
we
suggest,
the
current
administrative
position
provides
very
little
guidance
to
what
the
statute
means
and
how
it
should
be
interpreted.
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
act
which
confirm
that
epa’s
current
position
is
wrong
and
that
congress
intended
the
regulatory
structure
to
be
based
on
guidelines
under
section
304(b).
section
515
of
the
act
creates
a
distinguished
scientific
review
committee.
epa
was
directed
to
send
proposed
regulations
to
this
committee
for
review
in
advance
of
publication.
section
515
refers
specifically
to
regulations
under
section
304(b);
it
does
not
refer
to
regulations
under
section
301.
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
if
congress
had
intended
regulations
to
be
issued
under
section
301
which
override
the
provisions
of
section
304(b),
it
would
not
have
provided
for
their
review
by
the
advisory
committee.
all
of
the
other
measure
regulations
--
pretreatment
standards,
new-source
standards
--
are
mentioned
along
with
section
304(b);
but
there
is
no
reference
to
section
301
regulations
in
section
515.
epa
not
only
fails
to
mention
515
in
its
brief,
but
also
fails
to
discuss
the
advisory
committee’s
review
of
inorganic
regulations,
characterizing
them
as,
“unscientific”.
the
committee
said,
among
other
things,
the
regulations
fail
to
take
into
consideration
great
differences
in
individual
facilities;
also
that
the
epa
disregarded
the
instructions
in
section
304
as
to
the
cost
of
application
of
practicable
and
available
technology,
especially
for
small
plants
in
the
industry.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no,
sir,
the
statute
commands
it.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
statute
says
they
shall
be
submitted
to
the
committee.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that
is
correct.
the
court
below
came
a
long
way
toward
recognizing
the
statutory
plan
based
on
guidelines
issued
under
section
304(b).
guidelines
to
be
applied
in
the
permit
process;
however,
its
concern
with
what
it
called
practical
considerations
and
its
desire
to
find
what
it
thought
was
a
workable
interpretation
of
the
statute
led
to
a
compromise,
which
we
believe
does
comport
with
the
words
of
the
statute.
epa,
the
court
held,
can
combine
regulations
under
section
301
and
304
and
issue
limitations
by
regulation,
the
court
said;
but
the
court
was
not
willing,
as
epa
would
like,
to
read
section
304
out
of
act.
the
limitations,
the
court
concluded,
are
presumptively
applicable;
that
is,
the
regulations
are
to
be
applicable
unless
the
presumption
is
rebutted.
the
reference,
the
court
said,
to
section
304(b)
in
section
301
means
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
factors
set
out
in
section
304(b)
were
to
be
applied
by
the
permit
officer
in
determining
whether
the
presumptively
valid
regulations
shall
be
applied
to
a
particular
plant.
the
court
stopped
short
of
requiring,
as
the
third
circuit
did,
that
the
factors
be
set
out
in
the
regulations,
and
we
believe
this
is
what
section
304(b)
commands.
the
compromise
by
the
court
below
on
what
it
called
practical
grounds
moves
a
long
way
from
epa’s
rigid
interpretation
of
limitations
to
be
cranked
in
by
rote
to
permits,
but
it
falls
short
of
compliance
with
section
304(b),
and
in
our
view
epa
should
be
directed
to
comply
with
section
304(b).
this
brings
me
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
which
has
already
been
discussed,
at
least
in
response
to
questions
from
justice
stevens.
epa
places
great
emphasis
on
subsection
(e),
which
justice
stevens
referred
to
that
refers
to
review
of
the
administrator's
action
in
approving
or
promulgating
effluent
limitation
under
sections
301,
302
or
306.
i
have
indicated
that
i
think
the
approving
language
was
in
there
to
provide
for
review
in
federal
courts
of
action
by
the
administrator
in
reviewing
state-issued
permits,
and
the
promulgating
language
was
there
to
deal
with
the
situation
of
section
301(c),
where
the
administrator
is
authorized
to
grant
deviations
from
the
1983
requirement
on
a
specific
finding.
we
believe
it
is
clear
that
under
the
normal
course,
the
regulations
under
304(b)
would
be
reviewable
in
the
district
court.
the
statute
contemplates
that
they
be
issued
at
different
times
than
the
new-source
standards.
there
is
no
question
that
the
review
of
new-source
standards
is
in
the
court
of
appeals'
section;
subsection
(a)
of
509
(b)(1)
specifically
so
provides.
however,
we
believe
that
is
an
appropriate
case
for
this
court
to
conclude
the
court
of
appeals
had
pendent
jurisdiction
to
review
the
guideline
regulations
at
the
same
time
as
it
reviewed
the
new-source
standards.
as
it
turned
out,
they
were
issued
on
same
record
at
the
same
time,
and
the
issues
that
arise,
the
technical
issues,
are
substantially
the
same.
it
is
therefore
in
our
view
an
appropriate
case
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
court
below
has
pendent
jurisdiction
--
this
is
different
from
exclusive
jurisdiction
--
and
would
not
invoke
the
90-day
clause
as
a
penalty
on
those
who
in
reliance
on
the
statute
did
not
file
within
the
90
days.
i
now
turn
to
the
cross-petition
in
1705,
in
which
the
government
seeks
review
of
the
holding
by
the
court
below
that
epa
should
insert
in
the
new-source
standards
what
the
court
called
an
escape
valve,
which
would
enable
permit
officers
to
make
adjustments
in
the
requirements
of
the
single-number
standards
to
take
into
account
the
special
circumstances
of
a
particular
new
plant.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes
sir,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
second
class
or
the
second
clause,
which
refers
to
effluent
limitations
for
municipal
plants,
which
are
required
to
implement
new-source
standards,
you
can't
very
well
have
regulations
for
limitations
that
implement
new-source
standards.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
second
clause,
which
deals
with
municipal
plants,
directs
that
effluent
limitations
are
to
be
achieved
for
municipal
plants,
which
require
compliance
with
applicable
pretreatment
requirements.
since
pretreatment
requirements
are
to
be
standards
issued
under
another
section
of
the
statute,
it
makes
no
sense
to
speak
of
effluent
limitations
by
regulations
to
require
application
of
pretreatment
standards,
which
are
also
to
be
set
out
pursuant
to
another
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
since
it
is
in
the
passive
and
you
can
find,
it
seems
to
me,
the
congress
using
both
words
together
to
refer
to
the
program
to
be
implemented
under
section
304(b)
so
far
as
existing
plants
are
concerned
and
under
306
or
307
so
far
as
new-source
standards
or
pretreatment
standards
are
concerned.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
as
a
policy
matter,
it
should
not
be
implied,
because
the
congress
looked
at
the
variety
of
existing
plants
and
set
up
a
structure
that
was
designed
to
deal
with
that
variety
and
do
what
i
repeated
three
times
to
see
that
similar
plants
with
similar
characteristics
get
similar
limitations.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
to
have
single-number
limitations
that
override
that
plan,
we
think,
is
not
in
conformity
to
what
the
congress
had
in
mind.
now,
the
escape
valve
which
the
court
had
in
mind
below
is
not
like
section
301(c),
which
authorizes
a
deviation
from
the
1983
technological
requirement.
the
standard
for
new
sources
is
best
available
demonstrated
control
technology.
the
escape
valve
envisaged
by
the
court
below
would
merely
authorize
the
permit
officer
to
deviate
from
the
single-number
limitations
that
are
in
the
standards
so
long
as
he
selects
a
limitation
which
requires
application
of
best
available
technology
for
that
particular
source.
without
such
authority,
new
sources,
many
new
plants
will
not
be
built.
we
suggest,
as
the
court
below
is
correct,
that
epa
cannot
foresee
in
a
single-number
standard
all
of
the
circumstance
for
all
new
plants
and
provide
for
them
in
a
single
number.
the
escape
valve
is
necessary
to
make
new
plants
built.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
at
subsection
(a).
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
306.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
forget
307
for
briefing.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor,
it
may
well
be
that
if
i
had
my
own
druthers
or
my
own
preferences,
i
would
have
elected
that
the
review
be
in
the
court
of
appeals;
but
my
druthers
are
not
very
important,
and
the
congress
did
not
make
that
election.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
as
it
turns
out,
it
became
part
of
a
plan.
they
contemplated
that
those
regulations
would
be
issued
at
a
different
time
than
new-source
standards
and
under
different
circumstances.
they
gave
them
a
different
time
sequence
to
do
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
second
thing
that
should
be
borne
in
mind
is
that
the
new-source
standards
are
made
independently
enforceable;
the
guidelines
regulations
are
not.
it
is
not
suitable
that
regulations
that
contain
ranges
and
factors
should
be
independently
enforceable.
it
is
the
permit
that
contains
the
effluent
limitations
that
is
enforceable.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there
is
no
doubt
and
i
agree
completely
with
the
eighth
circuit
that
these
regulations
should
have
clout
and
they
do
have
clout.
epa
can
review;
it
not
only
controls
its
own
permit
officers,
but
it
can
review
state-issued
permits
to
be
sure
they
are
within
the
guidelines,
as
the
statute
contemplates.
to
return
to
the
escape
valve,
section
402(k)
of
the
act,
we
believe,
contemplates
that
such
adjustments
will
be
made,
because
it
says
that
compliance
with
the
permit
shall
be
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
section
306.
the
logic
of
that
subsection
is
that
escape-valve
adjustments
were
in
contemplation
by
the
congress.
but
even
if
section
402(k)
were
not
in
the
law,
the
cases
established
the
principle
that
an
agency
may
establish
general
principles
for
general
standards,
but
it
has
an
obligation
to
look
to
the
facts
in
a
particular
case
in
light
of
the
statutory
standard
and
objective.
this
is
really
almost
an
element
of
due
process.
general
provisions
can
be
fatally
arbitrary
without
some
kind
of,
“escape
valve”.
the
water
act
did
not
leave
this
to
interpretation.
it
specifically
provided
in
section
402(k)
for
such
an
escape
valve.
these
cases
present
a
rather
unusual
situation
for
the
court.
it
is
unusual
that
an
issue
of
statutory
construction
is
being
presented
to
this
court
at
a
time
when
epa
has
just
launched
a
major
review,
looking
to
re-issuance
of
1983-step
regulations
and
new-source
standards,
pretreatment
standards,
for
21
major
industry
categories,
including
inorganic
chemicals.
the
1977-step
permit
process
is
virtually
finished,
permits
were
issued.
the
question
now
turns
on
the
renewal
under
the
1983-step
regulations.
as
the
court’s
decision
will
come
at
a
time
when
the
regulations
are
in
their
inception
rather
than
at
the
conclusion
of
an
ongoing
process
that
is
now
underway
for
review
and
re-issuance
of
all
of
these
regulations.
epa’s
review
was
undertaken
pursuant
to
an
agreement
signed
in
june
of
this
year
with
the
natural
resources
defense
council
and
others
to
settle
four
lawsuits
filed
in
the
district
court
against
epa.
the
federal
register
for
november
24th,
1976
contains
a
reference
to
this
review.
it
contains
an
invitation
for
the
public
to
participate
in
what
epa
calls
the
development
of
major
epa
environmental
regulations
and
lists
on
several
pages
the
regulations
under
consideration.
on
page
51865,
it
lists
the
24
industry
categories
under
the
following
heading:
proposed
effluent
guidelines
are
now
being
revised
for
review
of
best
available
technology
--
that
is
1983
--
in
the
following
source
categories;
then
it
lists
the
21.
it
is
perhaps
a
little
more
than
interesting
that
out
of
the
litigation
context,
they
call
them
guidelines.
this
same
notice
refers
to
the
review
that
i
mentioned
earlier
undertaken
in
august
1974
of
the
variance
clause,
and
it
says:
proposed
variance
regulations:
regulations
establishing
procedures
for
obtaining
variances
from
best
practical-treatment
requirements
and
adopted
effluent
guidelines.
again,
it
is
interesting
that
they
call
them
guidelines.
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
reverse
the
decision
below
and
direct
epa
to
follow
the
requirements
of
section
304.
we
suggest
also
that
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
the
court
below
had
pendent
jurisdiction
to
review
the
regulations,
since
they
were
issued
on
the
same
record
at
the
same
time
as
the
new-source
standards
which
were
before
the
court.
we
think
it
is
appropriate
in
this
case
because
of
the
special
circumstances
of
the
case.
in
the
cross-petition
dealing
with
the
new-source
standards,
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
sir.
there
are
other
cases
argued
at
about
the
same
time,
but
the
eighth
circuit
was
the
first
one
announced,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor,
i
realize
it's
late;
may
i
take
just
a
minute
or
so?
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
hope
i
don't
need
to
take
it.
mr.
friedman
referred
to
a
quotation
from
a
request
for
an
application
by
a
contractor
that
was
quoted
in
part
in
our
brief.
i
will
confess
to
the
court
that
the
paragraphs
that
he
quoted,
we
eliminated
on
the
grounds
of
brevity;
but
we
ask
the
court
to
look
at
them,
and
we
suggest
the
court
also
look
at
the
contract
as
it
was
finally
issued.
there
is
a
notice
which
the
contract
required
the
contractor
to
put
into
his
report.
here
it
is
on
page
6424
of
the
record.
happily,
it
is
reprinted
in
the
final
document
in
the
form
of
a
notice
called
an
abstract
that
appears
in
the
front
of
the
development
document,
which
is
the
form
of
the
notice,
and
it
says
that
the
regulations
that
this
document
is
designed
to
assist
in
developing
effluent-limitation
guidelines
for
existing
point
sources
and
standards
of
performance
and
pretreatment
standards
for
new
sources
to
implement
sections
304,
306,
and
307
of
the
act.
there
is
no
reference
to
section
301.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
you
need
to.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
suggest
you
won't,
your
honor.
most
of
the
permits
that
have
been
issued
were
issued
before
regulations
were
issued.
they
were
issued
under
the
guidance
documents,
which
had
the
same
sort
of
general
form
as
the
304(b)
regulations.
the
hearings
are
provided
in
the
statute.
nothing
has
been
cluttered
up.
the
permits
have
been
got
out
in
due
course,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
they
won't
be
going
on,
and
exactly
the
same
procedure
has
happened
in
the
past.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
do
not
think
that
at
this
stage
of
the
game
we
are
dealing
with
a
challenge
to
existing
permits.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
it
is
conceivable,
although
since
the
permit
system
was
administered
under
a
program
that
resembles
304(b),
i
see
no
reason
you
should
anticipate
something
is
coming
that
did
not
come
in
the
past.
may
i
address
again,
i
believe
it
was
you,
mr.
justice,
who
said
that
the
remark
in
the
request
for
a
proposal
from
a
contractor
was
not
a
very
direct
statement
of
authority
under
301.
i
referred
to
the
notice,
which
they
had
directed
be
attached.
mr.
friedman
also
referred
to
the
notice
published
of
proposed
rulemaking
published
in
1973,
and
he
read
from
page
61
in
this
book.
if
you
move
to
page
62,
what
epa
said
is,
the
regulations
proposed
herein
set
forth
effluent
limitations
guidelines
pursuant
to
section
304(b)
for,
and
then
it
lists
all
the
categories;
not
a
word
about
section
301.
i
don't
want
you
to
look
at
6,000
pages,
your
honor.
but
we
urge
that
these
statements
be
examined,
because
we
think
the
contention
that
somehow
or
other
the
administrator
before
february
1974
claimed
this
power
by
implication
will
not
stand
an
examination
of
the
record.
now,
mr.
friedman
referred
to
section
301(e),
which
provides
that
effluent
limitations
established
pursuant
to
this
section,
section
302,
shall
be
applied
to
all
point
sources
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
act.
if
you
look
at
301(c)
and
(d),
which
have
the
cross-references
to
the
procedures
in
that
act,
this
section
seems
to
us
when
they
are
talking
about
pursuant
to
the
section,
the
section
itself
sets
up
the
procedure,
which
is
regulations
to
be
issued
under
304
to
carry
out
the
requirements
of
technology
as
they
are
set
out
in
section
301
of
the
act.
it
is
not
limited
to
just
301(c),
as
was
suggested
in
our
view.
this
is
the
procedure
which
was
in
contemplation.
this
is
not
an
authorization
section.
this
is
a
procedure
which
is
in
contemplation.
i
will
not
discuss
the
legislative
history.
it's
discussed
perhaps
too
much
in
the
briefs.
what
we
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
neither
the
legislative
history
nor
these
considerations
of
practicality
of
administration,
whatever
they
are,
can
overcome
the
clear
command
of
section
304(b).
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
my
understanding
is
that
the
permit
proceeding
has
gone
forward,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
know
of
one
hearing
that
is
pending
on
a
permit,
but
that
is
all
i
know
of.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes,
indeed,
they
do.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
i'm
not
that
is
within
the
eighth
circuit
area;
but
i
think
that
states
do
have
regulations
which
they
apply,
and
the
statute
specifically
contemplates
that
they
may
impose
restrictions
that
are
more
severe.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
well,
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
does
not
prevent
the
permit
officers
from
going
forward
and
issuing
permits.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no,
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
--
well,
the
eighth
circuit
has
not
yet
addressed
the
validity
of
the
regulations
for
the
existing
plants
in
the
wet
corn-milling
industry.
the
judge
stewart
in
the
grand
processing
case
did
address
the
validity
of
those
regulations
and
didn't
conclude
that
those
regulations
were
not
supported
by
the
record
and
did
not
comply
with
the
statute.
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
that
is
now
on
appeal.
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
the
process
of
permit
issuance
has
gone
forward
despite
this,
with
the
permit
officers
working
out
within
the
context
of
what
they
understand
to
be
the
technology
and
the
statutory
standard
what
are
the
required
limitations
to
be
put
into
a
permit.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
thank
you,
your
honor.
