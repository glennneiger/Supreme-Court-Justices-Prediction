justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnard,
the
statute
does
not
specifically
refer
to
section
402,
what
you
just
quoted,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
talks
about
effluent
limitations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnard,
could
i
interrupt
with
just
one
question?
as
i
understand
your
basic
theory,
it
is
that
304
authorizes
guidelines;
pursuant
to
the
guidelines,
permits
will
be
issued
under
section
402.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
there
is
no
authority
in
the
epa
to
issue
limitations
pursuant
to
301.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
language
of
509(e),
which
specifically
says
there
is
a
court
of
appeals
review
in
agency
action
approving
or
promulgating
any
effluent
limitation
or
other
limitation
under
section
301.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
have
addressed
yourself
to
the
word
"approving",
but
not
to
the
word
"promulgating".
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
read
301(c)
as
providing
for
general
deviations
or
specific
with
regard
to
specific
permits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
language
says
the
administrator
may
modify
the
requirements
of
subsection
(b)(2)(a)
of
this
section
with
respect
to
any
point
source
for
which
a
permanent
application
is
filed,
i
thought
it
kind
of
dealt
with
the
specific
rather
than
the
general.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
any
event,
it
is
301(c)
that
you
say
is
all
that
is
really
referred
to
in
the
words
"approving
or
promulgating
any
effluent
limitation
or
other
limitation
under
section
301".
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnard,
under
the
515
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
you
do
not
challenge
the
epaâ€™s
authority
to
issue
general
limitations
for
new
sources.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
advisory
committee
have
authority
to
review
the
regulations
relating
to
new
sources?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
the
new
source
ones
and
the
guidelines,
but
not
the
existing
source
ones.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnard,
may
i
ask
you
one
further
question
on
the
first
part
of
the
argument,
just
to
be
sure
i
have
it
in
mind?
your
view,
you
stressed
the
passive
language
in
301(b)
that
there
shall
be
achieved
effluent
limitations
by
such-and-such
a
date;
but
your
interpretation
of
the
words
"effluent
limitations"
in
301(b)(1)(a)
is
that
that's
the
aggregate
of
all
the
individual
permits
that
shall
be
issued,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sorry,
i
didn't
follow.
what
did
you
just
refer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
unless
it
was
intended
to
be
a
flexible
term,
incorporating
both
the
general
requirement
and
an
aggregate
of
specific
requirements.
i
mean,
one
could
read
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
heart
of
your
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
there
is
express
authority
in
304,
there
is
an
absence
of
express
authority
in
301,
and
we
should
not
imply
authority
from
the
somewhat
ambiguous
language
in
301.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
we
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnard,
let
me
just
ask
just
one
more,
because
i'd
rather
catch
while
you
are
here
before
i
lose
all
this.
the
review
provisions
authorize
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
new-source
standards.
justice
john
paul
stevens
subsection
(a)
under
the
--
anything
--
action
under
307.
justice
john
paul
stevens
306,
right,
and
also
307.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
both
general
in
nature
in
this
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
you
say
there
is
comparable
importance
to
the
general
guidelines
authorized
by
304.
there
is
no
direct
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
action
taken
under
304.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
when
you
attach
similar
importance
to
304
as
you
do
to
306,
how
do
you
explain
that
disparity
in
the
review
provisions,
if
this
thing
fits
together
so
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
was
a
mistake
by
the
congress
or
part
of
the
comprehensive
integrated
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
stressed
the
importance
of
the
guidelines
in
letting
the
permit-issuing
officer
know
what
to
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
of
some
significant
under
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
cases
arise
under
the
1972
amendments
to
the
federal
water
pollution
control
act
and
come
here
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioners
are
eight
chemical
companies
that
filed
actions
challenging
regulations
issued
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
which
said
uniform
limits
on
the
discharge
of
pollutants
by
categories
or
classes
of
plants.
petitioners
contend
that
the
epa
does
not
have
the
authority
to
issue
a
binding
regulation,
but
rather,
only
has
the
authority
to
issue
flexible
guidelines
for
use
in
considering
the
individual
characteristics
of
each
plant
when
a
permanent
is
issued
for
that
plant.
we
now
hold
that
the
epa
has
the
power
it
has
claimed.
because
of
the
way
the
statute
structures
judicial
review,
our
holding
has
the
effect
of
allowing
direct
review
of
these
epa
regulations
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
the
first
circuit
correctly
analyzed
these
issues
and
we
affirm
that
part
of
its
decision.
in
another
of
its
decision,
that
court
held
that
epa's
standard
for
plants
which
will
be
built
in
the
future,
must
contain
a
variance
provision.
we
hold
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
such
variances
for
new
plants
and
we
therefore,
unanimously
reverse
this
part
of
the
fourth
circuit's
decision.
mr
.justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
