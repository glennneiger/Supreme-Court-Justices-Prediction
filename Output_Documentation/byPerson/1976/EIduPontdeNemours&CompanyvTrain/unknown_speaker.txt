unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
suggest
that
workability
is
not
a
factor
that
a
court
takes
into
account
when
it
examines
a
statute?
unknown
speaker
would
you
carry
that
to
the
point
where
if
pursuing
that
course
would
determine
that
the
statute
was
unworkable?
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnard,
i've
forgotten.
did
you
argue
the
eighth
circuit
case?
unknown
speaker
and
you
were
disappointed
when
the
other
circuits
went
the
other
way,
aren't
you?
am
i
correct,
was
the
eighth
circuit
the
first
one
to
come
down?
unknown
speaker
were
you
in
the
third
circuit,
too,
personally
at
all?
unknown
speaker
you've
lost
me.
page
30,
where
on
page
30?
unknown
speaker
thank
you
very
much.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
wouldn't
mr.
barnard
say
that
the
reference
to
section
301
in
subsection
(f)
refers
to
301(c)
and
the
modification
which
is
in
the
specific
case,
or
would
not
that
fit?
unknown
speaker
if
you
look
at
the
statute
broadly
and
if
you're
right
that
there
can
be
a
general
regulation
or
general
effluent
limitation
for
existing
sources,
what
is
there
in
the
statute
that
requires
a
permit
for
existing
sources?
unknown
speaker
i
would
assume
that
there
is
a
general
limitation
and
that
the
discharge
is
not
violating
the
general
limitation.
if
you're
right,
say
301
has
specified
a
general
standard,
i
am
a
plant,
an
existing
plant.
i
discharge
in
accordance
with
the
general
limitation
without
a
permit.
what
makes
what
i
am
doing
unlawful?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
there
is
nothing
in
402
that
requires
a
permit;
402
merely
is
permission
to
grant
permits.
unknown
speaker
it
authorizes
permits.
but
why
would
you
need
a
permit
if
you
are
complying
with
the
general
standard?
that
is
my
question.
unknown
speaker
are
all
these
variables
in
the
permits
determined
by
reference
to
the
guidelines
promulgated
pursuant
to
section
304,
or
do
they
come
out
of
thin
air?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
doesn't
mr.
barnard's
argument
on
section
515,
the
water
quality
or
information
advisory
committee,
just
kind
of
counterbalances
what
you
said.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
you
argue
as
though
this
statute
were
just
as
lucid
as
any
piece
of
legislation
could
be
and
that
you
can
all
fit
it
together
if
you
really
just
study
it.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
there
are
some
inconsistencies?
unknown
speaker
i
take
you
don't
believe,
though,
that
we
just
haven't
an
open
choice
as
to
which
way
to
go.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
just
on
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
or
do
we
have
to
look
to
some
purpose
or
other?
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
you
must
agree
that
under
your
construction
of
the
statute,
permit
issuers
are
going
to
have
a
much
narrower
range
of
this
question.
unknown
speaker
and
much
less
room
to
tailor
permits
to
the
needs
or
necessities
of
individual
plants.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
answer
is,
yes,
it
is.
unknown
speaker
good
deal.
unknown
speaker
furthermore,
you
say
yet
that
is
not
only
true,
but
congress
intended
it.
unknown
speaker
but
if
everybody
asks
for
a
hearing,
i
suppose
the
capacity
of
epa
is
more
of
the
states'
is
finite
in
this
respect.
unknown
speaker
in
that
connection,
mr.
friedman,
are
you
going
to
comment
on
mr.
barnard’s
observation
about
what
is
presently
going
on
in
the
revision
of
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
rules
had
already
been
adopted.
suppose
that
process
had
been
through
by
the
time
this
case
reached
here.
what
would
it
affect
this
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
would
the
new
regulations
govern
permits
that
will
be
issued
now?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
said,
that
the
government
permits
that
are
being
issued
now.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
posture
of
the
industries
here?
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
new
regulation?
unknown
speaker
those
industries
before
us.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
industries?
what
about
du
pont
that
is
litigating
here?
unknown
speaker
what
page?
unknown
speaker
are
there
more
than
6,026
pages?
unknown
speaker
are
they
in
this
book?
unknown
speaker
but
that
so-called
administrative
record
has
been
lodged
for
the
four
years.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
that
is
hardly
an
unambiguous
statement
by
the
administrator
that
he
was
going
to
issue
self-enforcing
regulations
under
301,
is
it?
do
you
really
think
it's
that
clear?
unknown
speaker
it
does
use
the
term
"effluent
limitations
guidelines",
which
is...
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
what
was
going
on
here
two
weeks
after
the
enactment
of
the
act
that
resulted
in
the
compilation
of
a
6,000-or-so
page
administrative
record?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
maybe
the
administrator
had
taken
his
cue
from
congress.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
can
i
ask
a
fairly
basic
question
that's
running
through
my
mind?
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
other
side
is
right
and
that
the
action
taken
under
301
is
a
complete
nullity,
there
are
no
legally
enforceable
regulations
under
301;
that
the
action
taken
under
304
is
not
self-enforcing,
it
was
just
some
kind
of
a
general
guide
and
you've
done
that.
does
it
really
make
any
difference
if
everybody
already
has
a
permit
pursuant
to
402?
unknown
speaker
the
difference
would
be,
i
take
it,
that
when
the
renewal
time
comes
up,
instead
of
renewing
the
basic
set
of
rules
in
one
single
proceeding,
you'd
have
to
review
a
multitude
of
permit
applications.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
basic
thing
we
are
fighting
about,
right?
unknown
speaker
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
if
you're
right
and
they're
wrong,
how
are
they
hurt
right
as
of
now?
it
does
not
really
make
any
difference
today;
it
just
makes
a
difference
on
renewals.
unknown
speaker
why,
if
they're
in
accordance
with
the
guidelines
and
they've
been
issued
by
the
man
who
has
the
authority
to
sign
the
permit,
what
difference
does
it
make?
i
don't
see
how
the
validity
of
any
already-issued
permit
can
possibly
be
affected
by
this
proceeding.
now,
maybe
i
missed
something
very
obvious;
but
i
just
don't
quite
see
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
friedman,
i
suppose
there
could
be
a
range
of
permits
that
could
be
issued
and
each
one
of
them
consistent
with
the
guideline.
unknown
speaker
and
if
a
specific
factor
that
the
administrator
has
prescribed,
he
has
no
power
to
prescribe;
and
if
a
state
might
have
issued
a
permit,
a
completely
different
permit
that’s
still
consistent
with
the
guideline.
i
would
suppose
that
there
would
be
an
industry
that
would
rather
have
the
state
issue
a
new
permit
than
to
keep
the
old
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
see,
this
document
is
a
hybrid;
it
is
a
301/304
kind
of
document.
unknown
speaker
and
if
they're
right
in
saying
301
is
a
nullity,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
it
really
doesn't
cause
a
repeal.
it
doesn't
nullify
the
document
to
the
extent
that
has
authority
under
304,
and
they
have
no
power
in
this
proceeding
to
get
review
of
304.
unknown
speaker
insofar
as
it
is
sustained
under
304;
but
then
they
would
have
had
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
start
all
over,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
so
it
had
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
the
new-source
aspect
of
it,
and
then
they
argue
as
pendent
jurisdiction,
as
the
existing
--
unknown
speaker
if
we
did
not
accept
their
pendent
jurisdiction
action,
that
would
not
have
been
done,
then
that
is
why
they
need
the
pendent
jurisdiction,
in
order
to
preserve
their
victory
--
unknown
speaker
the
11
that
were
sent
back,
any
question
about
them
before
us
now?
unknown
speaker
but
in
view
of
the
very
disparate
views
of
the
various
courts
of
appeal,
surely
this
issue
does
have
continuing
practical
importance,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
continuing
and
for
current
and
continuing
practice
to
get
it
resolved.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
it's
become
important
just
by
reason
of
the
issuance
of
--
unknown
speaker
most
permits
are
five-year
permits?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
one
other
rather
general
question,
am
i
correct
in
my
recollection
that
with
respect
to
some
industries,
some
industries
take
the
position
that
the
government
takes
in
terms
of
which
court
should
review
these?
unknown
speaker
and
the
industry
is
divided,
but
the
government
position
has
been
rather
consistent.
unknown
speaker
on
top
of
those
things,
as
well?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
the
cross-petition.
is
it
possibly
premature,
in
other
words,
you
criticize
a
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
but
is
there
anything
in
its
order
that
really
will
be
affected
by
our
take-down
processes?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
could
i
just
ask
you
a
question,
then?
in
the
eighth
circuit
where
you
had
an
unfavorable
decision?
unknown
speaker
who
was
proscribing
the
specific
effluent
standards
in
those
states
in
the
eighth
circuit?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know;
but
didn't
the
eighth
circuit
decide
that
he
had
no
authority
under
301
to
write
this
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
permits
in
that
circuit?
is
that
decision
been
stayed
or
what,
or
have
the
permits
been
issued
by
state
authorities
specifying
their
own
effluent
standards
consistent
with
the
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
because
i
suppose
if
you
win,
those
permits,
there
is
some
cloud
on
them,
isn't
there?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
barnard,
you
don't
want
us
to
read
that
whole
6,000
pages,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
barnard,
just
supposing
you
summarize
your
opponent's
argument
this
way:
that
even
if
you're
right
about
what
congress
expected,
the
way
the
congress
expected
the
act
to
work,
and
they
thought
there
would
be
the
guidelines
first
and
then
so
forth
and
so
on.
nevertheless,
they
did
put
in
this
escape
hatch
that
epa
can
issue
general
regulations
as
it
sees
fit.
and
after
it
had
some
experience
with
the
statute,
it
found
that
the
individual
permit
procedures
was
going
to
be
just
too
darn
cumbersome
and
we
needed
some
general
regulations
and
that
kind
of
was
something
an
administrator
could
do.
if
we
don't
follow
that
approach,
we
are
going
to
have
an
awful
lot
of
review
proceedings
on
individual
permits.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
true,
then
is
it
not
also
true
that
the
documents
you
challenge
are
really
valid
as
304
promulgations,
and
all
the
permits
are
perfectly
all
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
we're
dealing
with
a
problem
that
may
cause
there
to
be
a
large
number
of
challenges
to
existing
permits
and
future
permits;
that
is,
i
suppose,
what
i
am
saying.
unknown
speaker
what
has
happened
in
the
states,
mr.
barnard,
where
they
are
governed
by
the
eighth
circuit
judgment?
have
states
been
issuing
the
permits
with
their
own
specific
standards?
unknown
speaker
and
has
there
been
a
great
rash
of
litigation
in
those?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
states
do
not
want
to
face
a
lot
of
problems
to
do
that,
i
suppose
they
must
have
some
sort
of
standards
of
their
own
within
the
guidelines.
unknown
speaker
so
that
they
treat
one
permit
like
another
one.
i
assume
they
do,
they
have
some
writing
and
some
regulations
setting
out
in
the
eighth
circuit
area
the
equivalent
of
what
the
administrator
has
himself
published?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
there
are
some
states
in
the
eighth
circuit
that
are
following
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
it
doesn't;
but
it
does
say
that
the
specifics
of
the
permits
don't
need
to
be
those
that
the
administrator
prescribed.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
let
me
just
make
one
little
point,
mr.
barnard.
is
it
not
true
that
the
effect
to
the
eighth
circuit
holding
was
to
invalidate
the
epa’s
action
insofar
as
it
relied
on
section
301.
unknown
speaker
but
not
to
touch
it
insofar
as
it
relied
in
304,
which
provided
the
guidelines
which
would
justify
further
issuance
of
permits.
