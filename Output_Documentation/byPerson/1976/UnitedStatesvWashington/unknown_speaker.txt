unknown
speaker
he
had
not
gotten
any
miranda
warnings
he
was
talking
to
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheehan,
your
point
is
that
this
is
not
compulsion
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
if
that’s
true,
i
would
suppose
it's
not
compulsion
if
he
testified
in
a
trial
in
open
court?
unknown
speaker
no,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
correct
me
if
i’m
wrong
i
am
just
trying
to
get
the
thread
of
the
argument.
you
say
this
is
--
this
situation
is
different
from
the
police
interrogation
in
a
police
station
where
the
man
is
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
compulsion.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say,
there
is
compulsion
in
the
police
station
but
does
not
compulsion
in
the
grand
jury
room
because
it’s
more
public.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
reason
is
valid,
would
it
not
also
follow
that
testimony
in
open
court
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
would
not
be
testimony
pursuant
--
would
not
be
a
compelled
testimony.
unknown
speaker
well
then
it
would
be
--
to
what
does
the
fifth
amendment
ever
apply
then?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
this
case
to
you.
supposing
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial
decided
to
waive
counsel
and
appeared
from
self
and
he
was
--
subpoena
was
served
on
him
or
he
was
called
to
the
witness
stand
and
a
question
was
asked
of
him,
would
he
be
compelled
to
answer
within
--
say
he
didn’t
know
about
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
would
that
be
compulsion?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
compulsion
is
the
failure
to
exercise
a
privilege?
unknown
speaker
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
in
my
hypothetical
case
there
would
be
no
compulsion
because
he
just
didn’t
realize
that
he
was
--
unknown
speaker
well
he
probably
would
give
one.
i
realize
--
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
position
there
will
be
no
duty
to
warn.
no
compulsion.
there
will
be
no
fifth
amendment
issues.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
really
mean
that
trial
judge
could
say
take
the
stand.
unknown
speaker
that’s
compulsion.
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
question
--
unknown
speaker
but
to
do
that
to
an
ordinary
witness.
an
ordinary
witness
not
a
defendant
must
take
the
stand.
unknown
speaker
and
it
isn’t
deemed
compulsion
of
the
fifth
amendment
purposes
unless
he
has
ordered
to
answer
over
a
claim
of
the
privilege.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
well
settled
that
whatever
the
logic
of
it
maybe
that
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment
even
if
called
the
defendant
himself
to
the
stand
if
the
calling
is
done
by
the
prosecution,
am
i
correct?
the
prosecution
can’t
say
to
the
defendant
now
you
take
the
witness
stand.
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
violation
of
the
constitution,
heaven
sakes.
unknown
speaker
long
at
a
date
set
the
constitutional
rule
of
the
comment
on
its
failure
to
testify,
which
came
about
only
about
10,
12
years
ago.
this
constitutional
rule
that
violates
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
prosecution
to
call
the
defendant
to
the
witness
stand.
for
centuries
old,
at
least
i
think.
unknown
speaker
that
was
long
established
as
long
as
--
i’m
not
quite
–
couple
of
centuries
old
but
when
i
was
at
law
school
i
was
well
established
and
the
proposition
that
violates
the
constitution
to
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
is
only
about
15
years
old.
unknown
speaker
if
you
conceded
that
it
violates
the
constitution
namely
the
fifth
amendment
to
call
the
defendant
the
witness
stand
you
must
necessarily
also
concede
that
that
is
a
form
of
compulsion
within
the
meaning
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
there
is
less
compulsion
in
the
grand
jury
context
than
in
the
open
court?
unknown
speaker
the
argument
before
ran
in
just
the
opposite
direction
that
the
greater
the
public
character,
the
lesser
the
degree
of
compulsion.
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
that
apply
the
bench
trial
as
well
as
the
jury
trial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheehan,
i
interrupted
you
and
i
really
didn’t
mean.
you
are
going
to
give
us
two
distinctions
between
the
miranda
custody
interrogation
in
the
grand
jury.
one
being
the
public
character
and
you
didn’t
get
to
the
second.
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
say
well
how
it
defined
a
potential
defendant?
unknown
speaker
except
the
only
way
the
miranda
rule
is
an
exclusionary
rule
and
the
only
time
that
it
arises
that
this
is
in
a
criminal
trial
and
the
interrogatee,
whatever
the
word
is
of
course
as
what
was
questioned
by
definition
by
hypothesis
is
now
a
criminal
defendant.
so
obviously,
he
was
a
potential
defendant
at
the
time
he
was
being
interrogated.
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
obliged
to
give
anybody
warnings.
you
know
the
rule
is
an
exclusionary
rule.
unknown
speaker
keeps
evidence
out
of
a
criminal
trial.
unknown
speaker
it
is
compulsion.
it’s
compulsion
to
appear.
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
refuses
to
answer
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
says
i
won’t
answer,
they
take
him
before
the
judge
and
judge
just
orders
him
to
answer.
he
never
claims
a
privilege.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
never
claims
a
privilege
at
any
point.
you
can’t
say
that
the
compulsion
doesn’t
arise
sometimes.
it's
compulsion
to
appear
and
testify,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
no
privilege
against
self
incrimination,
there
is
privilege
against
compulsory
self
incrimination.
unknown
speaker
let’s
just
suppose
he
never
claims
a
privilege.
never
claims
a
privilege
--
do
you
testify.
unknown
speaker
he
just
refuses
to
answer
and
the
judge
orders
him
to
answer.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
answers.
and
he
incriminates
himself.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
is
compelled
certainly.
unknown
speaker
well
l
know
but
he
has
never
claimed
a
privilege.
but
he
still
is
compelled
to
incriminate
himself.
now,
what
gets
the
government
have
to
look
in
that
case?
why
is
the
evidence
admissible?
with
respect
to
a
witness
in
an
ordinary
courtroom
it
is
because
he
didn’t
claim
the
privilege.
unknown
speaker
and
that
compulsion
only
arises,
prefers
to
this
amendment,
after
you
are
compelled
to
answer
after
you
have
claimed
the
privilege.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
waiving
the
privilege
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
saying
there
was
no
compulsion
at
all.
which
are
you
arguing?
unknown
speaker
maybe
i’m
not
--
let
me
give
you
another
case.
supposing
a
witness
who
is
not
even
a
defendant
at
all
responds
to
a
subpoena
gets
on
the
witness
stand,
they
say
where
were
you
on
such
and
such
a
night,
and
he
says
i
would
rather
not
tell
you.
he
was
a
friend,
i
don’t
want
to
identify
him
because
he
is
some
personal
reason
and
the
prosecutor
says
you
must
answer
your
under
subpoena
you
got
to
answer
the
question.
is
he
being
compelled
to
answer
or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
he
is
not
claiming
privilege
at
all.
no
self
incrimination,
he
just
does
not
want
to
testify,
he
does
not
like
to
talk
about
his
friends.
can
he
be
compelled
to
answer
those
questions?
unknown
speaker
with
no
doubt
into
the
judge.
cant
you
just
say
--
unknown
speaker
so
then,
the
compulsion
arises
without
any
reference
to
the
judge
or
any
reference
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
that
arises
solely
from
the
subpoena
and
getting
on
the
stand
--
unknown
speaker
obeying
the
law
and
answering
questions.
unknown
speaker
if
then
not
withstanding
his
miranda
warning,
he
lies,
he
can
be
prosecuted
under
that
statute.
unknown
speaker
what
additional
protection
would
it
give
him
to
tell
him
he
was
the
suspect?
being
a
suspect
doesn’t
entirely
commit
perjury.
and
on
the
other
hand
even
though
you’re
not
a
suspect
your
protection
against
compulsory
self
incrimination.
unknown
speaker
well
isn’t
that
the
fact
as
in
almost
every
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
was
the
subpoena
returnable
in
the
grand
jury
room
itself
or
that
you
have
to
go
to
an
assistant
us
attorney’s
office?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
square
the
--
with
your
view
the
situation
of
the
ordinary
witness
in
a
civil
or
criminal
case
where
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
simply
refuses
to
answer
a
question
the
judge
orders
him
to
answer
it.
he
never
claims
his
privilege
and
he
incriminates
himself
and
that
answer
is
offered
in
later
in
the
criminal
case
and
he
claims
that
it
was
coerced
from
that
it
was
compelled
and
his
objection
is
overruled.
unknown
speaker
let’s
talk
about
the
witness.
unknown
speaker
talk
about
him
now,
why
doesn’t
he
win
with
his
fifth
amendment
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
take
the
ordinary
civil
case
of
automobile
accident
and
he
is
called
as
a
witness
and
he
is
asked
a
question
and
he
says,
i
prefer
not
to
answer
it
and
the
judge
orders
him
to
answer
and
he
incriminates
himself.
unknown
speaker
and
because
the
answer
is
later
admissible
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
in
terms
of
the
fifth
amendment
what
is
the
explanation?
unknown
speaker
because
he
didn’t
want
to
answer
and
the
judge
told
him
to
answer
or
ordered
him
to
answer
and
the
result
was
he
incriminated
himself.
unknown
speaker
let’s
talk
about
the
witness
i
was
talking
about.
why
wasn’t
he
--why
isn’t
his
fifth
amendment
right
infringed
in
the
example
i
gave
you?
unknown
speaker
whether
anybody
could
sensibly
say
he
knew
of
his
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
prosecutor
in
this
case
did
not
know
personally
that
respondent
was
a
target
of
the
investigation
but
the
files
did
show
that
respondent
maybe
a
target.
what
would
your
view
be
as
to
the
requirement
of
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
exercise
due
care
to
know
what
the
government
might
know
through
the
fbi
or
perhaps
other
officials?
unknown
speaker
but
perhaps
not
always.
unknown
speaker
in
gardner
the
court
stated
the
general
rule
derived
from
monia
or
how
one
pronounces
that
decision
and
it
said
there
were
three
exceptions
to
it.
which
of
those
three
do
you
think
applies
to
this
case?
unknown
speaker
which
of
the
three
is
the
more
relevant?
you
go
ahead
and
answer
it
any
way
you
wish.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
the
government
has
a
man
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
they
say
“did
you
steal
his
property?”
they
should
stop
and
say
by
the
way
if
you
answer
that
question
the
wrong
way
you
maybe
in
trouble?
unknown
speaker
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case
the
prosecutor
misinformed
him
as
to
his
rights
didn’t
he?
told
him
he
had
rights,
in
fact
didn’t
have.
he
said
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent.
you’re
not
required
to
say
anything
to
us
in
this
grand
jury
at
anytime
or
to
answer
any
questions.
now,
that
just
was
incorrect
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
he
was
required
to
answer
any
questions.
unknown
speaker
so,
he
was
misinformed,
he
was
told
that
he
had
rights
that
in
fact
he
didn’t
not
possess.
unknown
speaker
but
if
this
family
told
that
he
had
absolute
right
not
to
answer
questions
or
fortiori,
he
certainly
had
a
right
not
to
answer
any
questions
it
would
incriminate,
didn’t
he?
he
was
over
warned,
he
was
over
advised.
he
was
told
he
had
rights
that
he
didn’t
have
but
certainly
those
rights
would
include
rights
that
he
did
have.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
advised
he
didn’t
have
to
answer
any
questions,
wasn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
and
while
that
was
incorrect
advice,
that
was
the
information
he
was
given.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
totally
--
didn’t
have
to
answer
any.
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
he
was
told
he
could.
he
had
right
not
to
answer
any
questions.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weisberg
in
your
view
is
the
grand
jury
proceeding
a
criminal
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that’s
your
view
and
if
you
say
he
is
tantamount
to
a
defendant
when
he
is
a
putative
defendant.
do
you
still
agree
with
justice
stewart
that
he
was
over
warned?
unknown
speaker
i
understood
your
theory
to
be
that
he
was
in
essence
the
same
as
the
defendant
because
the
government
had
already
made
up
its
made
to
proceed
against
him
and
therefore,
his
rights
before
the
grand
jury
would
tantamount
to
his
rights
in
open
court
which
were
--
which
would
be
the
right
to
answer
no
questions
at
all.
would
the
right
not
be
in
the
subpoenaed
--
not
to
be
subpoenaed.
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
got
a
waiver?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
before
having
questioned
they
ask
--
just
as
after
every
question
they
ask
to
witness
for
a
grand
jury.
this
witness,
the
prosecutor
said
“remember
you
don’t
need
to
answer
this
question
at
all
if
you
don’t
want
it”,
secondly
you
don’t
then
furthermore
you
don’t
need
to
answer
they
can
incriminate
you.
which
warning
would
you
rather
have?
unknown
speaker
yes.
which
probably
would
you
rather
have
not
to
answer
at
all
and
not
embarrass
your
wife,
your
friend,
your
neighbors
or
the
latter?
unknown
speaker
but
justice
stewart’s
point
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
were
in
the
witness
chair
and
they
--
and
then
prosecutor
gave
you
both
of
those.
both
of
those
suggestions.
now,
we
know
we
don't
need
to
answer
at
all.
now,
you
want
to
answer
and
you
say
yes.
how
about
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
agree
with
that,
i
agree
with
that
but
what
about
you?
what’s
the
argument
that
it
isn’t
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver?
unknown
speaker
mr.
sheehan
may
i
just
ask
one
question.
you
know
the
over
warning
part
of
the
warnings
were
given.
you
need
not
answer
any
questions
at
all.
i
take
it
that
government
does
not
as
a
matter
of
routine
give
all
witnesses
such
advise
does
it?
because
that
would
mean
nobody
ever
have
to
answer
any
questions
for
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
is
it
not
fair
inference
then
that
if
a
person
like
this
is
given
such
a
warning
the
government
must
have
had
some
notion
intending
to
indict
him.
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
any
reason
to
give
a
warning
this
broad
unless
the
person
were
likely
defended?
unknown
speaker
should
he
testify
for
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
was
he
was
asked
why?
