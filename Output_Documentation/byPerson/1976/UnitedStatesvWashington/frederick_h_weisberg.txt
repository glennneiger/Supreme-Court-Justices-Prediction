mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
i’m
frederick
weisberg,
i’m
counsel
for
gregory
v.
washington,
the
respondent
in
this
case.
i’d
like
to
begin
by
setting
out
what
respondent's
position
is
in
this
case
and
then
the
course
of
that
state
is
clearly
as
i
can
what
our
position
is
not.
and
then
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
what
i
understand
to
be
the
position
of
the
government
and
why
we
think
that
position
is
simply
unsupportable
under
this
court’s
prior
decisions.
our
position
in
this
case
is
simply
put
that
the
government
may
not
compel
an
individual
to
incriminate
himself
by
requiring
him
to
testify
under
subpoena
before
grand
jury
that
has
focused
on
him
as
a
target
for
indictment
and
then
after
he
testifies
and
he
is
indicted,
use
against
him
at
his
criminal
trial,
the
compelled
self
incriminatory
testimony
without
demonstrating
that
the
defendant
made
a
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
when
he
chose
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
the
factual
premises
of
that
position
in
this
case
are
the
following.
both
prosecutors
testified
below
in
this
case
in
effect
that
their
purpose
in
subpoenaing
mr.
washington
to
the
grand
jury
was
to
enable
the
grand
jury
to
determine
after
hearing
his
testimony
whether
or
not
he
should
be
indicted
for
the
offense
under
investigation.
what
they
gave
him
was
a
very
official
looking
piece
of
paper
that
commanded
him
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury.
it
was
signed
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
in
the
name
of
the
chief
judge
of
the
superior
court
commanding
him
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
and
answer
questions
in
connection
with
an
investigation
into
a
crime
of
which
he
was
suspect
of
having
committed.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
no
your
honor.
the
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
grand
jury
section
of
the
united
states
attorney’s
office
is
to
have
pre-signed
subpoenas,
a
stack
of
them.
and
as
happened
in
this
case,
when
mr.
washington
came
in
and
asked
for
his
his
van
back
and
the
prosecutor
decided
this
was
someone
he
had
put
before
the
grand
jury
because
he
himself
maybe
implicated
in
this
offense.
he
had
it
in
the
subpoena
and
it’s
pre-signed
by
the
clerk
court
in
the
name
of
the
chief
judge.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
other
jurisdictions.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
it
is
not
unusual
mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
i’m
mentioning
not
because
it’s
unusual
but
because
mr.
washington
coming
in
without
counsel
gets
a
piece
of
paper
signed
by
the
--
in
the
name
of
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
commanding
him
to
appear
and
answer
questions.
and
i
state
that
only
because
it’s
a
factual
predicate
for
a
position
that
there
was
compulsion
in
this
case.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
that’s
true.
that’s
absolutely
correct.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
in
the
grand
jury
room
your
honor.
our
position
very
simply
is
that
mr.
washington
as
the
government
concedes
in
this
case
and
as
per
the
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
answer
every
single
one
of
the
prosecutor's
questions
in
the
grand
jury
relating
to
the
motorcycle
found
in
his
van.
he
could
waive
that
rights.
we
readily
concede
but
this
record
does
not
support
a
finding
that
mr.
washington
voluntarily,
knowingly,
and
intelligently
waived
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
two
courts
below
had
so
found.
having
stated
what
our
position
is
that
i
want
to
be
quick
to
stay
what
our
position
is
now.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
not
whether
grand
jury
target
witnesses
are
entitled
to
miranda
warnings
or
as
the
government
would
prefer
to
put
it
are
entitled
to
certain
warnings
on
top
of
miranda
warnings.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
extend
the
prophylactic
rules
of
the
miranda
case.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
in
the
case
of
grand
jury
target
witnesses
to
manufacture
a
set
of
warnings.
the
failure
to
give
any
one
of
which
automatically
will
result
in
the
suppression
of
testimony.
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
recognize
as
it’s
recognized
in
our
view
throughout
the
history
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
that
when
the
privilege
applies
as
i
will
go
on
to
indicate
why
we
think
it
does
apply
in
this
case,
it
must
be
waived
and
the
waiver
must
satisfy
the
requirements
of
a
voluntary,
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
and
that
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
and
i
might
add
in
that
connection
that
what
the
court
below
held,
what
judge
nevenka
writing
for
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
not
mr.
washington’s
testimony
must
be
suppressed
because
the
government
failed
to
give
a
particular
warning
that
he
thought
was
required
by
some
sort
of
prophylactic
rule,
extension
of
the
miranda
rule.
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
as
they
stated
the
issue
at
the
outset
of
our
opinion
and
as
they
held,
mr.
washington
did
not
voluntarily,
knowingly
and
intelligently
waive
his
privilege
for
among
other
reasons.
the
fact
that
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
presumably
or
was
certainly
not
told
that
he
himself
was
the
target
of
the
investigation
when
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
the
way
we
answer
that
question
your
honor
is
simply
this.
it
is
essential
to
our
position
that
at
the
time
mr.
washington
was
subpoenaed
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
okay.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
under
certain
circumstances
it’s
conceivable
to
me
given
the
purposes
for
which
he
was
subpoenaed
and
the
government’s
knowledge
at
that
time
he
would
have
a
valid
subpoena.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
the
answer
to
that
question
your
honor
the
seeking
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
the
answer
to
that
question
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
is
in
the
gardner
opinion
written
by
this
court
last
term
and
we
relied
very
heavily
in
the
gardner
opinion.
in
our
view
ordinary
witnesses
are
different.
i
might
add
in
a
trial
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
the
explanation
is
that
when
the
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
the
difference
is
your
honor
that
when
the
government
is
seeking
to
avoid
the
burdens
of
the
adversary
system.
the
very
thing
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
by
subpoenaing
target
witnesses,
people
who
expect
to
be
indicted.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
because
with
respect
to
ordinary
witnesses
your
honor
with
respect
to
whom
the
government
has
no
purpose
to
indict.
that
the
cases
from
this
court
have
recognized
primarily
in
dictum
but
cordell
by
holding
that
the
burden
is
on
the
witness
to
appraise
the
government
that
they
are
encroaching
on
fifth
amendment
territory.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
we
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
in
the
case
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
we
think
that
the
decision
in
gardner
which
we
set
forth
at
great
length
in
our
brief
is
exactly
the
authority
for
that
your
honor.
when
you’re
dealing
with
someone
whom
the
government
knows
will
incriminate
himself
by
giving
answers
and
whom
it
compels,
in
this
case
under
subpoena
to
give
those
answers
then
the
ordinary
rule
requiring
a
witness
to
put
the
government
on
notice
makes
no
sense.
the
government
knows
it's
compelling
incrimination.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
we
think
this
case
could
be
decided
under
either
provision
your
honor
but
i
think
it’s
part
of
the
self-incrimination
process.
we
do
not
view
the
waiver
requirement
as
simple
a
prophylactic
view.
if
someone
--
as
prophylactic
rule,
if
someone
is
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
and
is
in
a
situation
where
the
government
knows
in
advance
that
the
answers
are
likely
to
incriminate
him
and
sets
out
to
get
those
answers
by
compelling
him
with
a
subpoena
to
give
them,
then
we
think
that
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
that
he
waived
his
privilege
before
he
answered.
we
don’t
think
this
is
a
due
process
case.
the
government
would
prefer
to
see
this
is
a
due
process
case
and
if
his
testimony
is
voluntary
in
traditional
terms
then
that
ends
the
inquiry
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned.
we
don’t
think
that’s
the
case
here.
now,
the
government
does
not
argue
that
mr.
washington
waived
his
privilege
in
the
face
of
two
holdings
by
both
courts
below.
the
government
argues
instead
that
he
was
not
compelled
to
incriminate
himself.
presumably
the
argument
is
that
he
had
eventhough
he
testified
under
subpoena
he
had
the
right
not
to
incriminate
himself
by
simply
saying
i
refused
to
answer
on
the
grounds
that
the
answer
to
that
question
may
incriminate
me.
i
should
point
out
here
that
in
many
cases
like
this
and
certainly
in
this
case,
we’re
dealing
with
a
witness
subpoenaed
to
the
grand
jury
without
counsel
unable
to
afford
counsel
who
probably
at
the
risk
of
being
lived,
does
not
even
know
what
the
word
incriminate
means,
and
the
government
claims
that
what
his
burden
is
to
understand
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
fifth
amendment
privileges
to
know
which
questions
to
assert
it
to,
which
questions
it
doesn’t
apply
to
and
to
assert
it
when
it
applies
and
we
simply
think
that
view
ignores
reality.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
must
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
well,
no.
simply
no,
he
knew
that
there
was
a
stolen
motorcycle
at
that
point
that
there
was
a
stolen
motorcycle
found
in
the
back
of
his
van.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
well,
he
knew
how
it
got
there.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
have
heard
it
so
many
times
in
my
practice.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
pardon
me?
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
don’t
know
whether
it
is
different
or
not
your
honor
that
he
was
not
indicted
for
perjury.
everybody
that
he
told
that
story
to
had
doubts
about
it,
but
he
never
wavered
one
fact
from
the
way
it
happened.
and
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
mr.
justice
powell
in
our
view
the
focus
on
what
he
was
told
or
what
he
was
not
told
is
the
wrong
focus.
he
needed
to
be
put
in
the
position
where
his
decision
to
testify
could
satisfy
a
court
as
a
voluntary,
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
a
criminal
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
whether
he
understood
that
the
body
that
he
was
appearing
for
might
indict
him
for
a
criminal
offense
and
he
might
be
prosecuted.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
yes,
your
honor.
there's
every
likelihood
that
mr.
washington
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
government
meant
when
they
said
it
could
be
used
against
him.
for
all
he
know,
he
would
have
testified
later
as
a
witness
and
what
he
said
was
going
to
be
used
to
try
to
twist
his
story
then.
he
was
given
a
subpoena
by
a
prosecutor
who
indicates
in
the
record
below
that
he
may
have
told
him
that
he
was
needed
as
a
witness
in
connection
with
the
ongoing
grand
jury
investigation.
for
all
mr.
washington
knew,
when
he
testified,
he
was
appearing
as
a
witness
in
connection
with
an
investigation
against
two
other
people
and
i
might
say
that
that’s
not
my
own
--
that
is
my
personal
view
but
it
is
not
just
my
personal
view.
both
judges,
both
courts
below,
judge
hand
on
superior
court
and
judge
nevenka
for
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
warning
was
indispensable
in
this
case
to
a
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
and
both
refused
to
find
waiver
in
this
record.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
to
be
some
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
it
is
compelling
potentially
self-incriminatory
testimony
before
our
analysis
is
activated.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
would
think
at
a
minimum
that’s
correct
and
as
a
practical
matter,
prosecutors
generally
know
at
least
the
outlines
of
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
it
maybe
that
they
don’t
always
in
such
a
case
if
the
government
can
make
a
claim
before
a
review
in
court
that
this
was
really
an
ordinary
witness
that
they
have
no
basis
for
thinking
that
this
person
would
--
that
they
were
not
trying
to
avoid
the
burdens
of
the
adversary
system
but
by
building
a
case
against
this
person
out
of
his
own
mouth.
then,
it
seems
to
me
our
analysis
might
not
apply.
but
i
heard
back
to
the
opinion
you
wrote
last
term
in
gardner,
your
honor,
that
seems
to
me
all
of
the
requirements
of
that
opinion
are
met
here.
the
government
knew
exactly
why
it
was
subpoenaing
gregory
washington.
it
was
subpoenaing
because
it
didn’t
believe
the
story
and
it
thought
the
grand
jury
might
not
believe
his
story
and
if
they
didn’t,
the
grand
jury
would
indict
them
and
they
could
prosecute
them
and
use
his
own
testimony
against
him.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
in
a
sense
your
honor
i
think
all
three
apply.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
it
seems
to
me,
starting
with
the
one
that
seems
least
like
this
case.
the
difference
between
gardner
situation
and
mr.
sullivan
situation
and
the
situation
of
marquette
and
grosso
is
that
the
government
when
it
asks,
when
it
compels
marquette
and
grosso
to
file
a
tax
return
required
only
of
gamblers
knows
that
when
it
gets
that
return
it
has
incriminating
evidence
of
gambling
which
can
then
turn
over
to
the
states
or
the
federal
government
for
prosecution
for
gambling
offenses.
like
the
defendants
in
marquette
and
grosso,
mr.
washington
was
subpoenaed
because
the
government
knew
what
his
story
was
likely
to
be
and
that
it
would
like
be
likely
to
make
him
a
criminal
defendant
if
he
told
it
to
the
grand
jury
and
they
just
believed
it.
like
the
situation
in
miranda,
although
we
don’t
rely
in
the
prophylactic
aspects
in
miranda.
aside
from
the
custody
aspect
of
miranda
which
i
hope
to
get
to
in
a
minute,
because
i
get
is
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
the
other
half
of
the
miranda
decision
is
the
focus
rationale
that
when
the
police
are
questioning
suspect,
non
suspects
in
the
fact
finding
process,
people
on
the
street
who
might
know
something
about
an
offense,
about
whom
they
have
no
reason
to
think
are
guilty
of
any
offense.
there’s
no
requirement
to
give
warnings,
there’s
no
requirement
to
get
a
waiver
and
if
those
persons
happen
to
incriminate
themselves
at
some
point,
there
would
be
a
burden
to
get
warnings
when
he
became
a
suspect
but
at
least
the
threshold
statements
would
not
be
excluded
under
the
miranda
rule.
so
to
hear,
if
mr.
washington
was
subpoenaed
solely
because
he
was
someone
who
had
seen
the
van
driver
away
with
the
motorcycle,
just
an
ordinary
witness
and
lo
and
behold,
when
he
got
in
there,
the
government
realize
for
the
first
time
that
this
person
maybe
implicated
in
the
offense.
we
think
any
incriminating
statements
made
much
like
the
ordinary
witness
at
trial
would
not
be
protected
by
our
analysis.
except
that
it
is
our
view
that
when
the
person
began
to
incriminate
himself
in
the
grand
jury
testifying
under
compulsion
of
subpoena,
the
proceedings
ought
to
stop
and
the
prosecutor
ought
to
then
say,
“you
are
getting
yourself
into
trouble
perhaps
you
ought
to
consult
with
a
lawyer.”
and
i’m
not
sure
what
the
third
is
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
no,
your
honor.
if
the
question
after
this
--
if
he
is
subpoenaed
because
he
is
suspected
of
having
stolen
the
property
as
was
true
here
then
the
government
has
to
do
that
before
they
even
get
him
in
the
grand
jury.
that’s
our
view.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
your
honor
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
he
has
to
required
to
answer
every
question.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
we
have
not
argued
in
this
case
because
it
is
not
necessary
to
our
position
that
a
putative
defendant
in
the
grand
jury
has
like
a
defendant
in
a
trial,
an
absolute
right
to
refuse
to
testify
if
he
is
in
fact
refuted
the
the
defendant.
that
simply
is
not
necessary
our
position
and
so
we
can
argue
that.
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
based
on
--
in
some
part
on
mr.
justice
rehnquist
opinion
in
michigan
versus
tucker,
the
language
and
the
opinion
that
just
like
the
defendant
at
trial,
his
right
to
remain
silent
at
trial
could
be
practically
nullified,
if
you
make
him
go
into
the
grand
jury
without
counsel
and
defend
for
himself
and
decide
which
questions
he
think
might
incriminate
him
and
which
ones
he
think
might
not.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
if
i
understand
your
honor’s
question.
that’s
why
i
responded
to
mr.
justice
powell
by
saying
focusing
on
what
he
was
told
or
what
he
was
not
told,
it
seems
to
me
is
the
wrong
focus.
two
courts
below
viewed
this
record,
viewed
this
defendant
and
heard
arguments
and
held
that
this
was
not
a
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
and
they
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
that’s
correct.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
the
only
thing,
i’m
quarreling
with
is
that
means
that
he
was
over
warned.
we
submit
he
was
not
withstanding
an
under
warned.
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
why
he
shouldn’t
answer
questions.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
that’s
correct.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
see.
that
if
he
had
refused
to
answer
the
questions
without
claiming
the
privilege.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
our
view
that
contempt
proceedings
would
have
begun
very
quickly
and
the
prosecutor
would
have
told
him
that
he
misspoke
himself
when
he
said
he
can
remain
silent.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
the
compulsion
your
honor,
we
submit
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
your
honor
the
subpoenas
he
gets
tells
--
commands
him
to
testify
and
give
answers.
he
is
then
told
by
a
prosecutor
he
doesn’t
have
to
get
answers
not
knowing
without
a
lawyer
why
that
advise
makes
any
sense
to
him.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
he
may
not
have
understood
why
it
made
any
difference
to
him.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
he
may
have
understood
that
he
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
he
may
well
have
understood
that
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
not
in
our
view.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
when
your
under
subpoena
as
to
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
when
you’re
under
subpoena
as
a
target
witness.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
our
view
is
that
the
compulsion
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
it’s
not
a
temporal
thing
your
honor.
our
view
is
the
compulsion
ends
when
the
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
can
be
found
and
two
courts
have
found
that
it
cannot
be
found
on
this
record.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
the
short
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
the
long
answer
is
that
since
counselman
versus
hitchcock.
this
court
has
consistently
held
in
probably
a
hundred
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
understand
your
question.
it
is
not
a
criminal
case
in
the
sense
that
a
criminal
trial
is
a
criminal
case.
the
grand
jury
proceeding
is
--
that’s
one
of
the
problems
in
this
case
is
that
we
think
that
the
analogy
to
the
criminal
defendant
is
a
very
strong
one.
this
guy
--
if
he
answers
the
questions
as
he
did,
he
will
be
a
criminal
defendant
the
next
day
as
soon
as
the
grand
jury
hands
up
its
indictment
and
is
doing
it
without
counsel.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
met
that
as
an
argument
by
analogy
your
honor
as
the
supporting
basis
for
a
holding
that
a
true
putative
defendant
before
the
grand
jury
would
have
a
right
to
silence.
we
do
not
make
that
argument
in
this
case
because
it
is
unnecessary
in
this
case.
you
only
have
the
right
not
to
answer
incriminating
questions.
like
an
ordinary
witness
except
that
unlike
an
ordinary
witness
when
he
subpoenaed
because
he
is
not
an
ordinary
witness
because
he
is
the
target
that
the
ordinary
duty
to
inform
the
government
that
they
are
subpoenaing
self
incriminatory
testimony
is
unnecessary
because
it
makes
no
sense.
they
already
know
their
subpoenaing
self
incriminating
testimony
and
what
takes
its
place
is
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
your
honor,
he
was
warned.
we
agree
with
that
much
of
the
plurality
opinion
in
mandujano
that
says
certain
of
the
miranda
warnings
are
inapplicable
in
the
grand
jury
context.
our
position
is
that
miranda
fashioned
warnings
so
that
people
would
understand
what
they
are
giving
up
when
they
answer
questions.
the
warnings
that
are
applicable
in
the
police
station
are
simply
inapplicable
in
the
grand
jury
and
what
he
needed
to
be
told
in
the
grand
jury
was
“by
the
way
mr.
washington,
this
body,
whose
questions
you
are
about
to
answer
is
going
to
indict
you,
if
you
answer
them
a
certain
way”
and
you
don’t
have
to
and
if
you
want
to
remain
silent
you
have
that
right
to
do
so
but
you
should
know
when
you
testify,
if
you
don’t
remain
silent,
you’re
targeted
for
indictment.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
agree.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
agree.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
we
agree.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
would
respond
to
that
question
mr.
justice
stewart
in
two
ways.
first,
the
difference
between
an
ordinary
witness
and
a
target
witness
is
that
if
the
government
has
no
idea
that
this
witness
is
in
any
jeopardy,
that
it's
not
compelling
self-incrimination
by
subpoenaing
him
then
the
cases
have
recognized
that
he
has
to
tell
the
government
that
it's
compelling
self-incrimination
that
subpoenaed
and
it
is
duty
to
testify
will
force
him
to
incriminate
himself.
that
we
take
out
to
the
gardner
opinion
but
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
we
think
he’s
compelled
by
the
subpoena
your
honor
to
answer
and
if
he
is
compelled,
and
if
he
is
in
the
category
of
suspects
recognized
in
gardner
as
not
being
required
to
put
the
government
on
notice
simply
because
the
governments
already
had
noticed
then
the
compulsion
of
the
subpoena
is
only
undone
by
a
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
and
we
think
that
that
requirement
is
not
merely
a
prophylactic
rule.
this
is
not
a
due
process
voluntary
in
this
case.
this
is
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
case
and
when
the
privilege
applies,
it’s
a
constitutional
right
that
has
to
be
given
up.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
we
have
--
again
in
this
case
not
defined
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
agree.
the
principle,
we
think
is
the
one
that
emerges
from
the
gardner
opinion.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
when
the
government
knows
that
the
answer
is
that
it
is
compelling
by
subpoena
may
incriminate
that
witness
in
the
sense
that
the
witness
is
a
potential
target
for
indictment
and
what
the
government
knew
in
this
case
is
that
the
grand
jury
will
be
to
believe
him
or
it
wouldn’t
believe.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
will
incriminate
him
not
in
the
sense
that
he
is
definitely
just
believe
and
definitely
going
to
be
indicted.
but
in
the
sense
that
if
he
is
disbelieved,
he
may
well
be
indicted.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
but
in
this
case
your
honor,
the
difference
is
that
the
government
knew
when
it
subpoenaed
him,
that
one
very
likely
possibility
is
that
the
grand
jury
would
just
disbelieve
him
and
indict
him
and
that’s
why
they
subpoenaed
him.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no
in
light
of
the
mandujano
opinion
but
that
maybe
affected.
i
have
only
one
minute
left
and
i
would
--
do
i
have
a
minute
left?
i
think,
i
have
one
minute
left
and
i
would
like
to
comment
very
briefly
and
what
the
government's
argument
really
comes
down
do.
what
it
seems
to
be
--
to
me
to
be
is
that
if
they
tell
these
witnesses
what
the
constitutional
rights
are,
some
of
them
are
going
to
exercise
those
rights
and
the
government
is
going
to
lose
some
testimony.
if
what
they
are
worried
about
is
losing
the
testimony
of
the
individual
in
a
prosecution
against
that
individual,
our
view
is
that
that's
exactly
what
the
fifth
amendment
protects.
if
what
they
are
worried
about
is
losing
the
testimony
of
that
individual
against
others
who
may
not
might
know
about
in
the
world
of
crime,
our
view
is
that
it
loses
nothing
by
giving
warnings
because
it
tells
the
witness
with
effective
warnings,
or
obtaining
as
we
would
say
it
a
valid
waiver.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
that’s
our
starting
point
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
i
agree
completely.
our
starting
point
is
that
not
the
constitution
requires
a
warning,
the
constitution
requires
a
waiver
and
whatever
warnings
are
given,
a
court
has
to
be
able
to
say
that
when
that
person
decides
to
testify
it
was
the
product
of
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
but
what
i
wanted
to
mention
briefly
is
the
immunity
provisions
which
answer
almost
all
of
the
government's
arguments
about
losing
testimony
against
other
people
involved
in
crime.
if
the
person
has
to
make
a
waiver
and
refuses
to
waive,
the
solution
is
simply.
i’m
sorry
you
can’t
refuse
to
waive,
here
is
an
immunity
statute
that
compels
you
to
testify
despite
your
unwillingness
to
waive
and
they
can
compel
that
testimony.
and
the
only
thing
that
can
do
is
use
that
testimony
against
the
individual
whom
they
have
compelled
under
the
grant
of
immunity.
they
can
still
prosecute
the
individual
under
the
ruling
in
castigar.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
not
at
all
your
honor.
they
can
obtain
a
voluntary
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
of
those
two?
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
if
i
were
a
suspect,
it
is
right
not
to
answer
anything
regardless
of
the
incrimination.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
but
two
courts
below
your
honor
has
said
that
that
in
this
case
he
didn’t
knowingly,
intelligently
waive
his
privilege
because
he
didn’t
know
that
--
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
it
seems
to
us
your
honor
that
unless
this
court
can
conclude
that
that
was
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
over
the
holdings
of
two
courts
below
that
the
holdings
of
the
two
courts
below--
the
court
below
ought
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
that
he
had
no
basis
of
knowing
why
he
shouldn’t
answer
those
questions.
why
shouldn't
he
answer
them,
he
was
in
no
jeopardy,
they
want
to
know
about
the
motorcycle
found
in
his
truck,
it
was
driven
by
two
other
people.
i’ll
tell
them
the
story.
because
they
are
not
interested
in
me.
mr.
frederick
h.
weisberg
thank
you
your
honor.
