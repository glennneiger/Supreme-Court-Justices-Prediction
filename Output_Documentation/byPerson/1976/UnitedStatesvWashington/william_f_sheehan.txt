mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia,
court
of
appeals.
that
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court
suppressing
for
use
in
evidence
in
respondent's
prosecution
for
grand
larceny
and
for
receipt
of
stolen
property,
the
testimony
that
respondent
had
given
earlier
before
grand
jury.
unlike
the
one
just
heard,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
prosecution
for
perjury
and
accordingly
it
poses
squarely
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
requires
the
government
to
warn
grand
jury
witnesses
of
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination
when
the
government
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
witness
maybe
indicted
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
that
is
sought.
i
will
state
some
of
the
facts
quickly
since
there
is
a
claim
that
the
government’s
conduct
in
this
case
violated
the
due
process
clause.
on
the
night
of
december
3,
1972,
an
officer
of
the
metropolitan
police
stop
the
van
type
automobile
after
watching
it
make
a
u-turn
and
in
the
back
of
the
van
found
a
motorcycle
that
had
recently
been
reported
stolen.
the
two
occupants
of
the
van
were
arrested
and
the
police
determined
that
the
van
belonged
to
the
respondent
and
they
notified
him
that
the
van
was
in
their
possession.
within
the
next
several
days
in
an
effort
to
retrieve
the
van,
the
respondent
went
both
to
the
police
station
and
to
the
united
states
attorney’s
office.
on
both
occasions
he
said
that
he
did
not
wish
to
press
charges
against
the
two
men
found
in
the
van
who
would
--
it
had
been
thought
might
have
stolen
the
van
in
addition
to
the
motorcycle.
he
said
they
were
his
friends
and
it
had
his
permission
to
use
the
van.
he
also
said
that
he
himself
had
been
driving
the
van
on
the
evening
in
question
and
he
explained
the
presence
of
--
earlier
on
the
evening
in
question
he
had
been
driving
the
van
and
he
explained
the
presence
of
the
motorcycle
in
the
van
in
a
manner
that
both
the
police
man
to
whom
he
spoke
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
to
whom
he
spoke
found
unpersuasive.
i
will
get
his
explanation
in
just
a
moment.
the
policeman
in
fact
told
the
respondent
that
he
did
not
believe
his
story
and
that
if
respondent
were
to
testify
to
it
in
court,
they
would
be
likely
to
get
him
into
trouble.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
gave
the
respondent
back
his
van
and
gave
the
respondent
also
a
subpoena
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
investigating
the
crime.
he
did
so
because
he
was
afraid
respondent
would
not
appear
voluntarily
either
because
the
respondent
would
not
want
to
testify
against
his
friends
or
because
he
was
himself
involved.
when
the
respondent
came
before
the
grand
jury
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
charge
not
the
same
one
who
had
given
him
the
subpoena
was
uncertain
whether
or
not
to
seek
an
indictment.
he
was
not
sure
what
respondent's
testimony
would
be
or
whether
it
would
be
believable
and
accordingly
he
decided
to
leave
the
matter
entirely
to
the
grand
jury
itself
after
they
had
heard
his
testimony
--
after
they
had
heard
the
testimony
of
the
respondent.
before
the
respondent
testified
he
was
given
full
miranda
warnings.
he
said
that
he
understood
them
that
he
wanted
to
answer
questions
regarding
this
after
the
motorcycle
and
that
he
did
not
want
the
services
of
a
lawyer.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
he
had
not
had
miranda
warnings
when
he
was
talking
to
the
assistant.
no.
he
then
gave
testimony
to
the
following
effect.
on
the
night
in
question
he
said
he
had
been
driving
the
van
and
he
had
stopped
to
help
a
stranger
whose
motorcycle
had
broken
down.
the
two
of
them
put
the
motorcycle
in
the
van,
he
said
and
drove
on
looking
for
help
and
the
van
itself
drove
down.
excuse
me
when
the
van
itself
broke
down.
he
then
left
the
stranger
with
the
motorcycle
and
van
he
said
and
walked
a
block
or
two
away
to
a
gasoline
station
where
he
telephoned
his
two
friends
to
come
help
him.
he
said
that
he
waited
at
the
gas
station
for
two
hours
and
his
friends
did
not
appear.
he
said
he
then
went
back
a
block
or
two
away
to
where
the
van
had
been
left
and
found
it
was
gone.
he
said
that
he
did
not
report
the
disappearance
of
the
van
because
he
said
he
assumed
that
his
friends
had
come
and
fixed
it
and
then
driven
it
away.
the
stranger
who
owned
the
motorcycle
he
said
was
never
heard
or
seen
again.
never
heard
from
or
seen
again.
following
his
testimony
in
due
course
the
grand
jury
indicted
him
along
with
the
other
two
men
for
grand
larceny
and
received
stolen
property.
the
superior
court
then
granted
the
respondent's
motion
to
suppress
his
testimony
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
obtained
in
violation
of
his
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
the
court
held
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
conducting
the
grand
jury
had
not
adequately
inquired
into
the
respondents
ability
to
understand
his
rights
and
in
addition
had
failed
to
warn
respondent
on
top
of
the
warnings
he
had
received
that
his
testimony
could
result
in
an
indictment
by
the
grand
jury.
in
affirming,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
principal
respect
in
which
the
full
miranda
warnings
which
respondent
had
received
were
deficient
was
that
he
had
not
--
was
in
that
he
had
not
been
told
that
he
was
a
potential
defendant.
the
upshot
of
the
decision
is
that
a
potential
defendant
is
entitled
in
the
court's
view
in
the
court
of
appeals
view
under
the
self-incrimination
clause
both
the
miranda
type
warnings
and
to
target
warnings.
it
seems
appropriate
to
begin
the
analysis
here
with
something
that
in
our
view
the
court
of
appeals
gave
too
little
attention
to.
the
words
of
the
constitutional
provision
themselves.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
this
court
in
miranda
against
arizona
found
that
the
procedures
surrounding
custody
interrogation
by
the
police
of
a
witness
of
a
suspect
were
inherently
coercive.
and
accordingly
it
held,
that
a
set
of
warnings
was
necessary
in
order
to
balance
things
out.
without
those
warnings
it
is
now
conclusively
presumed
that
any
testimony
statements
given
by
the
witness
were
compelled
against
the
suspects
will.
the
issue
for
decision
today
is
whether
questioning
it
in
front
of
a
grand
jury
is
also
inherently
coercive
that
warnings
are
required
before
any
testimony
given
by
a
witness
in
response
to
questions
by
the
government
maybe
considered
voluntary.
our
position
is
that
there
are
many
differences
between
the
questioning
of
a
suspect
by
the
police
in
custody
and
the
questioning
of
a
witness
in
regular
grand
jury
proceedings.
for
the
most
part,
we
think
that
these
differences
are
self
evident.
they
are
also
--
they
are
in
any
event
set
out
at
length
in
our
brief.
i
will
mention
only
two.
before
the
decision
in
miranda
the
interrogation
by
the
police
occurred
principally
in
private.
in
contrast,
the
questioning
of
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury
occurs
before
between
16
and
23
private
citizens
who
are
not
likely
to
be
in
our
view
so
compliant
to
the
prosecutor's
wishes
as
to
countenance
the
kind
of
abuses
that
were
cataloged
by
this
court
in
miranda.
second
question,
i
might
add
that
the
view
that
i
just
expressed
was
i
think
stated
also
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
groban
decision.
he
said
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
officers
of
the
state
seriously
to
abuse
or
deceive
a
witness
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury.
moreover,
the
questioning
in
front
of
a
grand
jury
is
undertaken
under
the
overall
supervision
of
a
district
court
judge
and
frequently
the
questioning
is
transcribed
and
reported
as
it
was
here.
in
short,
the
privacy
that
before
miranda
allowed
the
abuses
of
custody
interrogation
that
were
perceived
to
exist.
it
does
not
exist
in
the
grand
jury
setting
and
there
is
according
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
if
he
testified
as
a
witness
in
trial
in
open
court.
if
your
question
mr.
justice
well
the
government
has
an
obligation
to
warn
a
defendant
in
criminal
cases
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes
indeed.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes
indeed.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
for
that
reason
and
others.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes
it
does
indeed
follow.
that
is
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
to
testimony
that
is
compelled.
the
subpoena
does
not
compel
testimony.
the
subpoena
mr.
justice
stevens
compels
only
the
appearance
of
the
witness
and
once
the
witness
does
appear
in
response
to
lawful
process,
it
is
open
to
the
witness
then
to
claim
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
to
any
questions
that
he
fears
may
tend
to
incriminate
him.
he
would
be
compelled
in
this
situation
only
if
in
response
to
such
a
claim
the
district
court
perhaps
upon
the
grant
of
immunity
would
order
him
to
testify.
the
subpoena
itself
is
simply
legal
process.
there
is
no
constitutional
privilege
to
object
to
legal
process.
there
is
no
--
he
has
no
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
it
would
not
be
compulsion.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no.
the
compulsion
is
not
the
failure
to
exercise
the
privilege.
the
compulsion
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
compulsion
occurs
when
by
the
government’s
affirmative
conduct
did
overbears
the
witness's
will.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
not
unless
he
was
--
not
unless
he
was
instructed
by
the
government
that
he
was
compelled
to
answer
questions
or
that
he
was
compelled
to
take
the
stand.
i
suspected
probably
the
hypothetical
would
not
occur
i
suspect
in
a
case
like
that
the
district
court
in
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
the
district
court
probably
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no
i
think
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
oh,
no.
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
that
might
well
be
compulsion
sir.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
oh,
no.
no,
the
question
to
which
i
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that’s
correct.
indeed
if
the
district
court
just
ordered
the
witness
or
that
the
defendant
take
the
stand
without
more
that
would
not
be
compulsion.
it
would
have
to
be
an
order
to
answer
the
questions
that
were
put
to
him
that
would
be
compulsion.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that
is
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
it
would
also
be
a
violation
--
it
would
also
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute
making
the
defendant
competent
to
testify
on
his
own
behalf.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
constitution
in
large
measure
because
the
government
could
not
oblige
the
defendant
in
that
case
assert
his
privilege
in
front
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
the
situation
is
quite
different
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
setting
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well
it
--
i’m
not
certain
if
it
is
a
couple
of
centuries
old,
i’m
prepared
to
see
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well
i’m
prepared
to
concede
for
purposes
of
argument
here
that
it
is
indeed
settled
today
that
it
would
violate
the
constitution
for
the
defendant
--
for
the
government
to
call
the
defendant
to
the
stand
or
in
anyway
to
comment
upon
his
failure
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
even
if
it
is,
my
position
is
that
the
situation
in
the
grand
jury
is
entirely
different.
the
grand
jury
there
is
no
rule.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
the
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes
indeed.
the
grand
jury
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
think
the
issue
of
whether
the
defendant
can
be
called
to
the
stand
in
a
criminal
case
is
not
the
issue
post
here.
in
any
event,
the
grand
jury
is
entitled
it
would
seem
to
me
to
accord
whatever
weight
it
thought
it
wanted
to
a
witness's
refusal
to
make
statements
in
the
grand
jury
setting.
so,
i
think
that
in
contrast
to
the
situation
with
the
trial
jury
where
they
are
not
allowed
to
make
any
inference
whatsoever.
for
example,
if
the
witness
in
the
grand
jury
setting
decided
that
he
was
going
to
exercise
his
privilege
and
persuaded
the
prosecutor
they
are
not
to
call
on
in
front
of
the
grand
jury,
the
prosecutor
would
not
be
precluded
from
telling
the
grand
jury
and
for
example
in
response
to
an
inquiry
by
them
why
that
individual
would
not
come
to
testify
before
them
that
that
individual
is
going
to
assert
his
privilege
and
so
he
had
not
been
called.
but
the
touchdown
of
our
position
is
that
for
there
are
to
be
a
requirement
of
miranda
warnings
in
this
case,
this
court
has
got
to
find
that
the
setting
of
the
grand
jury
is
as
inherently
coercive
as
is
custodial
interrogation.
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
stated
in
brief,
we
find
that
there
is
no
reason
in
this
case
to
reject
the
traditional
test
for
determining
the
voluntariness
of
the
person’s
response.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well
they
were
both
turns
on
the
same
point.
the
first
was
that
it
was
public
because
it
was
in
front
of
between
16
to
23
citizens
and
the
second
was
it
did
have
the
protection
of
being
under
the
overall
supervision
of
the
district
court
and
also
there
was
the
added
safeguarded
transcripts
being
made
at
the
testimony
in
many
cases
as
it
was
here.
to
this
point
i’ve
been
talking
only
of
the
questioning
of
grand
jury
witnesses
in
general.
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that
all
grand
jury
witnesses
were
required
to
receive
warnings.
it
held
instead
that
only
potential
defendants
were
required
to
receive
warnings.
it
follows
then
that
the
court
must
believe
that
the
questioning
of
potential
defendants
somehow
more
coercive
than
the
questioning
of
ordinary
witnesses.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
it
did
not.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
under
either
of
the
tests
for
defining
a
potential
defendant
either
a
subjective
test
going
to
what
was
in
the
prosecutor's
mind
or
an
objective
test
going
to
what
was
in
the
prosecutors
files
would
be
the
likely
candidates
for
determining
who
is
a
potential
defendant.
we
failed
to
see
however
how
the
content
of
the
prosecutor's
mind
or
of
his
files
has
any
bearing
on
the
question
whether
the
setting
in
the
grand
jury
is
inherently
coercive.
certainly
in
the
miranda
situation
this
would
be
irrelevant.
i
take
it
the
police
would
not
be
heard
to
say
that
warnings
were
not
required
when
they
questioned
an
individual
in
custody
against
whom
they
had
no
intention
to
press
charges.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
he
may
not
have
been
a
potential
defendant
so
far
as
the
government
knew
though.
he
might
not
have
been
a
potential
defendant
so
far
as
the
police
new
when
they
questioned
him
but
the
police
would
nonetheless
be
obliged
to
give
him
warnings
in
the
miranda
situation.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes.
that’s
true.
you’re
not
obliged
to
give
warnings
if
you
don’t
give
warnings
and
statements
are
made,
they
may
not
be
used
because
they
are
deemed
involuntary.
well,
we
think
that
as
the
court
recognized
last
term
in
the
beckwith
case,
the
miranda
presumption
of
involuntariness
and
the
miranda
type
safeguards
should
apply
only
when
it
can
be
said
that
the
setting
of
the
questioning
is
indeed
inherently
coercive
and
that
in
our
view
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
government
thinks
or
knows
this
or
that
at
the
time
of
the
questioning.
my
opponent
does
not
appear
to
argue
that
questioning
before
grand
jury
is
necessarily
as
coercive
as
custodial
interrogation.
indeed,
at
page
three
of
respondent
--
at
page
23
of
respondents
brief
note
11,
it
is
said
that
the
matter
is
open
to
some
doubt,
it’s
a
matter
of
speculation,
he
says
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
not
as
inherently
coercive
as
custodial
interrogation.
the
argument
instead
appears
to
proceed
upon
the
assumption
that
as
was
discussed
earlier,
the
subpoena
itself
is
a
form
of
compulsion
of
--is
a
form
of
testimonial
compulsion.
if
that
were
the
case,
if
the
subpoena
without
more
amounted
to
compulsion
to
testify
in
contravention
of
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
then,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
many
immunity
statutes
and
also
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
construing
those
statutes
would
be
very
curious
indeed,
if
it
was
compulsion
simply
for
the
witness
to
walk
into
the
grand
jury
in
response
to
a
subpoena
commanding
his
appearance.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
it
is
indeed
a
compulsion
to
appear.
it
is
not
a
compulsion
to
give
testimonies
since
the
witness
after
he
appears
is
entitled
to
raise
his
privilege
at
any
point
that
he
thinks
a
question
if
answered
would
tend
to
incriminate
him.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
think
in
a
situation
like
that
under
the
cordell
case
it
might
be
too
late
for
him
to
claim
the
privilege
later
on
if
he
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
it's
compulsion
to
appear
and
testify
but
not
to
testify
as
to
matters
that
fall
within
your
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
there
is
a
privilege
against
compulsory
self
incrimination.
the
subpoenas
command
to
appear
and
testify
though
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
command
the
testimony,
as
to
compel
the
testimony
from
a
witness
that
the
witness
reasonably
believes
would
tend
to
incriminate.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
and
he
refuses
to
answer.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes
and
then
what?
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
and
incriminates
himself.
well
in
that
case
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well
certainly
if
the
judge
orders
him
to
answer
and
he
does.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
think
that
the
general
rule
is
because
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
think
in
that
case
it
--
the
general
rule
stated
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
monia
is
that
the
witness
has
to
claim
his
privilege
in
the
grand
jury
setting
or
else
it
is
going
to
be
lost
to
him.
i
think
then
his
failure
to
assert
the
privilege,
i
think
if
he
failed
in
the
face
of
the
district
court
order
or
in
the
face
of
the
questions
themselves
to
assert
the
privilege
under
the
general
rule
that
it
must
be
asserted
he
would
lose
a
privilege.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
don’t
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
well,
i
think
in
that
case
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
to
--
if
he
wanted
to
keep
his
testimony
out
of
a
subsequent
prosecution
to
say,
i
don’t
want
to
testify
because
it
would
violate
my
privilege.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
i
think
he
can
be.
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
there’s
no
question
about
it
he
is
not
being
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
oh
no
but
he
is
not
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no
but
the
compulsion
is
that
--
the
compulsion
takes
place
when
he
is
compelled
to
incriminate
himself
when
he
is
called
to
testify
and
he
says
“i
don’t
want
to
testify
because
i
don’t
want
to
get
my
friends
into
trouble.”
he
is
then
stating
in
open
court.
i’m
not
being
compelled
to
testify
in
violation
of
my
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
if
it
turns
out
later
that
in
fact
he
was
and
he
had
an
ulterior
reason,
it
seems
to
me
not
unfair
to
insist
that
he
stated
his
constitutional
reason
at
the
time
he
was
compelled
to
answer.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no.
he
cannot.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
that
is
my
understanding.
and
he
would
not
in
that
case
--
i
think
in
that
case
he
would
indeed
be
compelled
to
answer
if
--
because
the
only
reason
he
could
avoid
it
--
well,
i
think
in
that
case
he
would
be
ordered
to
answer
by
the
district
court
judge.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes,
i
think
that’s
right.
i
turn
now
to
the
question
whether
the
failure
whether
the
failure
by
the
government
to
give
a
target
warning
on
top
of
the
miranda
warnings
that
were
given
or
indeed
alone
automatically
results
in
the
coercion
of
the
witness.
certainly,
if
warnings
regarding
the
privilege
are
not
required,
it
seems
to
us
they
neither
are
target
warnings
because
the
witness
cannot
be
more
coerced
by
the
failure
to
receive
a
target
warning
than
he
is
by
the
failure
to
receive
warnings
regarding
the
privilege.
even
if
some
warnings
are
required
by
the
privilege,
it
does
not
follow
automatically
that
a
target
warning
is
required
in
addition.
if
warnings
of
the
privilege
are
required
to
be
given
to
a
potential
defendant
presumably
the
reason
will
be
that
they
are
necessary
to
overcome
an
inherently
coercive
atmosphere
in
the
grand
jury.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
we
think
that
such
warnings
would
not
by
themselves
be
enough
to
dispel
any
inherent
coerciveness
that
might
be
found
to
exist
in
the
grand
jury.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
haven’t
thought
about
that,
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
give
an
easy
answer
to
it.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
he
would
not
have
to
tell
him
he
was
the
suspect
as
well
in
those
--
in
that
case,
i
think
we
--
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
that’s
right.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
yes.
the
only
addition
help
it
seems
to
me
that
the
target
warning
gives.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
gives
no
help
that
warnings
of
the
privilege
don’t
know
already
give
to
protect
against
self
incrimination.
the
result
is
the
same
in
respect
of
target
warnings
under
the
due
process
clause.
we
think
that
as
i
suggested
in
the
argument
just
passed
that
there
is
little
to
be
gained
by
shifting
the
analysis
from
the
self-incrimination
clause
to
the
due
process
clause.
a
target
warning
seems
to
us
to
be
conceivably
helpful
to
the
witness
only
insofar
as
it
aids
in
the
decision
making
process
as
to
whether
or
not
to
invoke
the
privilege.
that
process
it
seems
to
us
is
afforded
all
the
protection
to
which
it
is
entitled
by
the
self-incrimination
clause
alone.
it
must
be
assumed
therefore
that
some
values
not
associated
with
the
privilege,
not
protected
by
the
privilege
are
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
in
the
context
of
a
case
such
as
this.
we
can
think
of
none.
in
most
cases,
the
witness
already
knows
in
addition
whether
or
not
he
is
a
potential
defendant.
indeed,
he
may
know
that
far
sooner
than
the
government
will
discover.
that
would
make
an
additional
putative
defendant
warning
doubly
unnecessary
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
in
any
event,
the
facts
of
this
case
certainly
do
not
show
a
due
process
violation.
before
questioning
the
respondent
in
this
case
the
grand
jury
--
in
front
of
the
grand
jury,
the
attorney
gave
him
full
miranda
warnings.
the
respondent
knew
what
crime
was
under
investigation.
the
respondent
knew
in
addition
that
his
connection
with
the
crime
was
known
to
the
authorities
by
virtue
of
his
own
statements
made
earlier
to
the
police
and
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
he
also
knew
that
the
explanation
of
his
involvement
was
not
then
believed
by
the
policeman
to
whom
he
first
told
it.
in
these
circumstances
the
prosecutor's
failure
to
give
him
a
target
warning
on
top
of
full
miranda
warnings,
seems
to
us
was
not
so
fundamentally
unfair
as
to
deprive
the
respondent
of
due
process.
indeed,
we
believe
it
was
not
unfair
at
all
and
i
will
reserve
what
ever
time
i
have
left
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
would
like
to
add
one
point
in
the
conclusion.
we
think
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
statements
were
voluntary.
voluntary
statements
are
admissible.
it
was
not
--
this
testimony
was
not
compelled
against
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
by
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
alone.
that
seems
to
me
be
the
first
question
the
court
has
to
decide,
is
whether
the
subpoena
to
appear
coerces
testimony
in
violation
of
the
privilege.
if
that
does
not
as
we
believe
it
does
not
then
the
court
must
decide
whether
or
not
this
situation
is
one
in
which
you
can
abandon
the
traditional
test
for
voluntariness.
was
the
witness's
will
overborne
by
some
sort
of
informal
coercive
practices
such
as
took
place
in
the
miranda
case.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
that’s
probably
right.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
oh,
i
think
that
there
is
no
--
no
i
don’t
think
it
is
fair.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
person
was
a
possible
defendant.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
gave
him
these
warnings
had
not
decided
in
his
own
mind
whether
he
would
request
an
indictment
from
the
grand
jury
in
respect
to
this--
in
respect
to
the
respondent
or
not.
i
mean,
he
was
certainly
aware
that
there
was
a
likelihood
50%
chance
as
far
as
he
knew,
maybe
more
that
an
indictment
would
follow.
following
this
respondent’s
testimony.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
think
that’s
entirely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don’t
think
that
this
--
i
don’t
think
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
this
case
focused
on
this
question
to
the
extent
that
we
are
today.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
i
believe
he
did.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
no.
mr.
william
f.
sheehan,
iii
thank
you.
