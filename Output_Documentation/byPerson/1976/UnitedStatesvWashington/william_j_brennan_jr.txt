justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sheehan
may
i
ask.
i
suppose
this
interrogation
is
not
a
grand
jury
interrogation.
an
fbi
agent
in
a
custodial
context.
i
gather
at
18
1001
makes
any
willfully
false
statement
in
that
context
even
though
he
has
had
miranda
warnings.
is
it
not
a
crime
punishable
by
$10,000.00
fine
and
not
more
than
five
years
imprisonment
under
18
usc
1001
isn’t
it?
the
way
it
leads
is,
in
any
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
department
or
agency
of
the
united
states
willfully
makes
any
false
statement
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$10,000.00
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
five
years
above,
that’s
what
the
statute
says.
now
in
that
context,
is
it
enough
to
give
miranda
warnings
or
to
have
also
to
give
him
target
warnings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
the
hypothesis
is
that
it's
a
custodial
interrogation
of
the
suspect
by
an
fbi
agent
who
gives
them
miranda
warnings.
does
he
also
have
to
tell
him
he
is
a
suspect?
