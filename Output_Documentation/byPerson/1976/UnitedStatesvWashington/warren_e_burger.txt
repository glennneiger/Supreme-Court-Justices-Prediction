chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
1106
united
states
against
gregory
washington.
mr.
sheehan
you
may
proceed
when
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
doesn’t
it
fall
under
the
cases
that
simply
say
that
there
can
be
no
reference
to
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
testify
and
that
would
be
one
way
of
calling
attention
to
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
the
advice
of
calling
in
the
first
type
of
the
hypothetical
calling
him
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
which
is
then
made
aware
of
his
failure
or
his
refusal
to
testify.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
short
answer
might
be
that
there
is
a
high
press
to
protecting
your
friends
in
that
setting.
you
might
either
be
in
contempt
of
court
or
find
your
self
charged
with
perjury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
sheehan.
mr.
weisberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
any
different
in
any
way
from
the
usual
subpoena
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wondered
why
you
thought
that
was
unusual.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
get
a
similar
piece
of
paper
if
you
were
called
in,
there
is
a
possible
witness
in
an
automobile
accident
case
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
description
of
his
colloquy
with
the
police
would
indicate
he
was
rather
in
his
rights,
innovative,
inventive
kind
of
a
fellow.
wouldn’t
you
think
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean,
he
didn’t
know
that
he
was
in
some
on
threshold
possibly
of
some
kind
of
trouble?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
someone
had
just
happened
to
place
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
point
that
justice
stewart
took
you
and
characterized
it
as
an
over
warning,
he
had
already
been
told
that
he
can
have
a
lawyer
outside
the
courtroom
to
help
him
or
haven’t
he?
and
then
that
continues,
you
have
also
have
a
right
to
stop
answering
at
any
time
until
you
talk
to
a
lawyer
which
again
is
an
over
warning.
he
didn’t
necessarily
have
that
right.
now,
the
prosecutor
went
on
and
said
do
you
want
to
answer
questions
in
reference
to
the
stolen
motorcycle
that
was
found
in
your
truck
and
he
said
“yes
sir”
and
do
you
want
a
lawyer
here
or
outside,
that’s
the
third
time
now
he’s
is
told
about
a
lawyer
and
do
you
want
a
lawyer
here
or
outside
the
grand
jury
room
“no,
i
don’t
think
so.
how
do
you
say
again
that
he
hasn’t
been
warned
about
his
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
isn't
whether
the
government
loses
something.
the
question
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
whether
it
is
a
good
idea
to
give
warnings.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
your
theory
then,
the
only
way
you
can
compel
testimony
before
a
grand
jury
is
to
grant
immunity
to
people.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
although
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
weisberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
sheehan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
it
equally
and
likely
that
this
warning,
over
warning,
was
something
inadvertent
mistake.
this
is
not
the
standard
warning
that’s
given
to
witnesses
if
they
have
a
standard
warning
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn’t
any
focus
on
the
over
warning?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
74-1106,
united
states
against
washington
for
a
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
cases
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
joining
him,
had
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
