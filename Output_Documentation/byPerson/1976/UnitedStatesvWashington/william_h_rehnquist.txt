justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
supposing
a
witness
is
asked
a
question
by
the
prosecutor
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
says
i
just
won't
answer
that.
perhaps
for
reasons
like
justice
stevens
suggested.
now
can
he
at
that
stage
be
prosecuted
for
content?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
do
you
have
--
do
you
have
to
go
before
the
--
do
you
have
to
go
before
the
judging
get
an
order
compelling
him
to
answer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
classical
definition
of
compelled
self-incrimination
is
one
who
was
ordered
to
answer
a
question
over
the
claim
of
privilege.
so,
when
you
talk
about
the
question
of
waiver
you
are
putting
the
cart
before
horse.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authority
do
you
have
from
this
court
for
your
proposition
that
in
this
type
of
situation
you
have
to
show
annoying
and
intelligent
waiver
rather
than
the
claim
of
privilege
of
being
an
element
in
the
compulsion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
of
a
due
process
not
a
fifth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
wouldn’t
have
to
give
any
reason
for
not
answering
under
the
text
of
the
prosecutors
warning.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that’s
a
question
that
says,
suppose
the
compulsion
--
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what’s
your
definition
of
a
target
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
quite
important,
it
would
adopt
the
principle
that
you
are
advocating,
prosecutors
would
have
to
know
who
were
target
defendants
and
who
weren’t.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
define
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
the
government
say
--
when
the
government
knows
that
the
answer
it's
compelling
from
the
witness
will
incriminate
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that’s
true
of
any
witness
before
a
grand
jury,
even
if
he
just
believe
he
maybe
indicted
probably
for
perjury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
i’m
a
prosecutor
and
i
know
that
a
potential
grand
jury
witnesses
have
to
lie
before
the
grand
jury.
do
i
have
to
warn
him
that
he
is
a
potential
perjury
defendant?
