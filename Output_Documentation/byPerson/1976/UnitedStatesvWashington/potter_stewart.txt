well,
now,
i
don’t
--
i
know
that's
the
argument
you
make
and
i
know
that’s
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
but
certainly
whether
or
not
you
are
targeted
in
an
investigation
doesn’t
either
elevate
or
depress
your
constitutional
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
testify
against
yourself.
that’s
true
whether
you
are
target
or
whether
you
are
not
a
target.
justice
potter
stewart
and
neither
true
or
nor
less
true
whether
or
not
you
are.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
or
not
--
whether
you
are
a
target
or
not
a
target
you
don’t
have
any
privilege
to
tell
a
lie
under
oath
which
of
course
is
not
involved
here.
justice
potter
stewart
so
why
--
what’s
the
point,
what’s
the
purpose
of
telling
somebody
is
a
target.
his
constitutional
right
is
no
greater
and
no
less
whether
he
is
a
target
or
isn’t
a
target.
