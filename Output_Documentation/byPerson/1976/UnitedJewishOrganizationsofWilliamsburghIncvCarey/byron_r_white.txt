justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
section
5
is
co-terminus
with
the
constitutional
command?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
every
violation
of
section
5
has
to
be
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
in
the
beer
case,
suppose
in
the
beer
case
in
order
to
not
to
diminish
the
black
representation,
in
that
case
it
was
necessary
as
a
statute
to
comply
with
section
5
to
take
specific,
draw
a
line
specifically
based
on
race,
and
yet
no
one
would
have
claimed
there
is
a
constitutional
violation.
are
you
suggesting
that
section
5,
in
those
applications,
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
were
saying
your
initial
argument
is
that
never
a
quota
is
permissible,
but
in
that
case,
in
the
beer
case
it
might
be
true
that
in
order
to
comply
with
section
5
you
would
have
to
draw
the
districts
based
on
racial
composition,
specifically
and
with
that
purpose
in
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
richmond
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
reason
is
that
the
statute
commands
it
and
as
construed
by
the
court
and
your
suggestion
is
as
construed
the
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
sometimes
if
you
do
not
reach
it
then
you
must
concede
that
sometimes
it
is
alright
and
sometimes
it
is
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
perhpas
say
that
there
you
saw
the
case,
let
us
say,
with
the
purpose
to
discriminate
against
in
order
to
disentitle
or
to
diminish
the
rights
of
the
whites,
but
wouldn’t
you
be
making
the
same
arguments
that
the
purpose
was
on
a
racial
basis
to
improve
the
situation
of
negroes
or…
justice
byron
r.
white
constitutionally
not
supposedly
expressed
purpose
of
legislature
was
to
increase
the
likelihood
of
negroes
who
are
getting
to
be
elected,
and
get
into
candidates.
so,
they
say
let
us
make
it
65%
nonwhite
or
let
us
assume
65%
black
in
as
many
districts
as
possible.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
be
making
same
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
both
of
legislature
districts
expressly
and
explicitly
for
the
purpose
of
maximizing
the
number
of
republican
districts
or
the
maximum
number
of
democratic
districts.
so,
in
order
to
as
they
said
approach
by
districting
as
near
as
possible
proportional
representation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
expressly
they
draw
the
lines
on
a…
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
submission
is
if
the
legislature
concludes
that
the
whites
and
blacks
or
whites
and
nonwhites
tend
to
vote
at
blocks
and
we
would
like
by
districting
to
come
as
near
as
possible
as
to
have
the
nonwhite
strength
in
the
community
reflected
in
the
legislature.
that
would
be
bad.
that
would
be
unconstitutional
because
they
express
the
intended
districts
on
the
basis
of
race.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lewin,
i
know
what
the
facts
are
on
the
case
and
isn’t
it
true
that
after
this
districting,
this
reapportionment
occurred,
the
white
community
in
general
have
not
been
disenfranchised
or
its
representation
had
been
diminished.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
overall
representation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
which
is
a
different
question
and
i
can
see
that
i
guess
is
the
one
i
really
intent.
was
the
white
representation
any
less
than
its
proportional
number
in
the
community?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
saying
that
after
this
reapportionment
the
representation
of
the
whites
had
a,
been
diminished
and
b,
been
diminished
below
their
proportional
number
in
the
community.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
your
position
but
somebody
else
might
think
it
is
important.
i
was
wondering
what
in
fact
the
fact
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
have
a
different
answer
to
that
question
if
the
white
community
had
been
disenfranchised
to
some
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
the
solicitor
general
that
in
effect,
the
attorney
general
can
take
a
particular
situation
and
draw
the
plan
and
tell
the
state
this
must
be
it,
or
none
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
does
not
need
to
take
it,
they
can
litigate.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
true
that
the
attorney
general
in
order
to
object
to
a
plan
such
as
he
objected
to
in
this
case,
would
have
to
make
his
own
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
black
racial
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
i
think
that
there
must
be
some
assumption
that
there
is
going
to
be
some
black
racial
voting
or
the
chances
of
discrimination
would
be
considerably
less.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
do
you
think
in
this
court
supports
that
statement
outside
the
area
of
remedy
for
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
not
holding
with…
justice
byron
r.
white
this
dictum
in
swann.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nothing
here
you
can
say
things
in
swann,
the
dictum
in
swann?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
about
beer?
justice
byron
r.
white
why,
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
suppose
beer
would
--
is
it
implied
from
beer,
infer
from
beer
that
if
the
plan
was
disadvantageous
to
the
black
community,
that
there
must
be
some
lines
--
the
lines
must
be
changed
even
there
was
not
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
a
challenge
to
a
new
york
reapportionment
in
so
far
as
that
statute
applied
to
kings
county.
the
challenge
was
and
is
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
state
impermissibly
used
racial
criteria
in
drawing
certain
district
lines
in
the
--
in
the
county.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
challenge
and
we
affirm
that
judgment
by
both
of
seven
to
one.
mr.
justice
marshall
takes
no
part
in
this
case
and
chief
justices
filed
the
dissenting
opinion.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
which
gives
two
essentially
independent
reasons
for
the
--
for
the
judgment.
neither
reason
commands
a
majority
to
the
court
but
there
are
five
justices
who
joined
one
or
the
--
joined
one
or
the
other.
the
first
reason
is
that
what
the
state
did
was
authorized
by
the
voting
rights
act.
the
second
reason
is
that
without
any
help
in
the
voting
rights
act,
what
new
york
did
violated
neither
the
fourteenth
nor
the
fifteenth
amendment.
in
the
first
reason,
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
stevens
joined
me.
and
in
the
second
reason,
mr.
justice
regnquist
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
any
event
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
--
an
opinion
concurring
the
judgment
and
he
is
joined
by
mr.
justice
powell.
as
i
say,
the
chief
justice
has
filed
the
same
opinion.
