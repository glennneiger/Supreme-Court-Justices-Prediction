mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
together
with
my
colleagues,
mr.
greenberg
and
schnapper,
i
represent
the
naacp
which
intervened
in
the
district
court
in
this
case
to
oppose
petitioners’
claim,
the
lines
adopted
by
the
new
york
legislature
in
1974
to
delineate
the
assembly
and
the
senate
districts
in
the
county
of
brooklyn
unconstitutionally
abridge
the
franchised
petitioners
and
other
white
residents
in
that
county.
in
the
short
time
available
to
me
i
will
attempt
to
advance
two
linked
propositions,
namely
that
the
1974
lines
are
constitutionally
proper
both
as
to
purpose
and
as
to
effect.
but
before
advancing
these
propositions
i
will
with
the
court’s
permission
try
to
address
a
few
preliminary
words
to
two
critical
aspects
of
this
case.
first
it
has
to
do
with
the
anomalous
nature
of
the
petitioners’
constitutional
claims.
the
second
goes
to
peculiar
procedural
posture
of
this
case,
the
case
which
comes
here,
if
the
court
please,
not
after
a
full
trial,
but
after
a
very
brief
hearing
on
petitioners’
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
i
submit
a
far
too
truncated
record
to
begin
to
sustain
petitioners’
extraordinary
claim
of
proof
that
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
have
collaborated
to
abridge
petitioners’
constitutional
rights.
now
in
saying
that
petitioners’
claim
is
anomalous
i
have
in
mind
two
aspects.
to
the
extent
that
petitioners
are
in
effect
asserting
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
have
their
hasidic
community
remains
forever
in
a
single
voting
district.
i
submit
that
they
are
arguing
for
a
preference
whether
it
would
be
denominated
an
ethnic
or
religious
or
indeed
a
political
preference
which
is
unknown
to
the
constitution.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
no
your
honor.
i
submit
that
on
whatever
basis
those
persons
have
come
together,
they
are
no
more
entitled
than
any
others
in
the
american
population
to
remain
a
discrete
voting
district.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
believe
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
i
was
just
about
to
go
on,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
the
proviso.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
i
have
heard
that
and
i
believe
that
is
the
alternative
claim.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
i
hope
that
is
the
basic
one
because
i
myself
mr.
justice
brennan
have
been
trying
fully
to
understand
where
mr.
lewin’s
claim
lies.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
there
have
been
enough
references
to
the
importance
and
integrity
of
the
community
as
such
to
lead
me
to
believe
that
we
at
least
ought
to
establish
that
that
could
not
be
the
basis
for
a
constitutional
claim
in
this
court.
unless
of
course
mr.
chief
justice,
action
were
taken
hostile
to
that
community
because
of
their
race
or
religion,
but
there
is
not
a
word
in
this
record
suggest
hostility
to
the
hasidian
as
such.
in
that
connection
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
as
mr.
lewin
already
has
to
mr.
justice
stevens’
very
instructive
opinion
in
the
cousins
case,
but
before
its
elevation
to
this
court,
the
opinion
in
466
f.
2d.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion
mr.
justice
stewart.
though
i
believe
you
will
find
that
as
the
case…
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
judge
fairchild
would
conclude
that
ultimately
he
and
judge
stevens
were
on
the
same
side.
now,
if
in
the
alternative
and
i
think
this
is
the
alternative
we
must
proceed
on,
mr.
lewin
is
claiming
that
the
discrimination
here
is
against
his
clients
as
whites,
then
i
must
submit
to
this
court
that
any
claim
that
brooklyn
is
a
county
in
which
whites
are
politically
disadvantaged
by
virtue
of
the
1974
districts
in
mind
is
with
all
respect
an
upfront
to
common
sense.
here
i
must
disagree
with
my
brother
lewin’s
understanding
of
the
statistics
we
tried
to
set
forth
apparently,
unsuccessfully
in
our
brief
supplemented
by
a
letter
from
my
colleague
mr.
schnapper
which
i
believe
is
now
come
to
the
court’s
attention.
whites
constitute
less
than
65%
of
brooklyn’s
population
but
they
are
the
majority
race
in
15
out
of
brooklyn’s
22
assembly
districts
and
seven
of
brooklyn’s
ten
senate
districts.
moreover,
and
this
goes
directly
to
mr.
lewin’s,
i
am
afraid,
misunderstanding
of
statistics
we
tried
to
set
forth.
white
legislatures
sit
in
17
of
the
22
assembly
districts
and
eight
of
ten
senate
seats.
they
did
this
as
a
result
of
the
1974
elections.
that
is
to
say
they
hold
all
white
majority
districts
and
additional
nonwhite
majority
districts.
17
out
of
22
assembly
districts
in
brooklyn,
eight
out
of
ten
senate
seats,
and
last
month’s
primaries
indicate
that
exactly
that
pattern
will
continue
in
general
as
a
result
of
the
general
election.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
your
honor
only
in
a
sense.
what
if
this
goes
to
is
that
the
effect
of
what
has
been
done
here
is
certainly
not
to
disadvantage,
politically
to
disadvantage
whites
in
the
county
of
brooklyn.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
am
in
agreement
if
your
honor
please
with
mr.
lewin
who
suggested
that
one
looks
at
bexar
county.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
one
looks
at
it
and
hopefully
one
learns
to
pronounce
it
correctly
your
honor.
here
sir
we
look
at
brooklyn
as
the
political
entity
which
is
subject
to
the
voting
rights
act.
and
looking
at
brooklyn
as
that
total
entity
in
which
petitioners’
base
their
constitutional
claim
as
disadvantaged
whites,
it
seems
to
me
almost
frivolous
to
assert
that
disadvantage
has
been
worked
on
the
white
community.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
because
your
honor
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
is
invoked
county
by
county.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
if
mr.
chief
justice,
we
were
to
look
at
the
state
of
new
york
as
a
whole,
i
have
not
been
that
ambitious
to
survey
the
entire
state
we
would,
i
submit,
get
a
formal
sweeping
demonstration
that
the
state
of
new
york
is,
like
brooklyn
itself,
safely
in
white
political
hands.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
but
you
will
have
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
the
new
york
legislature
attempting
to
redistrict
following
the
1970
census.
perhaps
it
bares
remembering
that
the
new
york
legislature
was
not
simply
attempting
as
mr.
lewin
seems
to
have
suggested
to
address
itself
to
that
particular
purpose
of
disenfranchising
his
clients.
it
was
required
under
the
new
york
constitution
to
redistrict
the
state
following
the
1970
census.
the
1972
lines
disapproved
to
address
to
that
purpose,
the
1974
lines
were
replaced
the
disapproved
1972
lines,
and
the
meeting
of
the
objections
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
particular
disadvantage
in
noncompliance
for
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
as
it
applied
to
brooklyn
was
simply
one
of
the
modest
purposes
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
but
that
was
a
purpose
which
was
addressed
to
the
county
of
brooklyn
as
such
because
it
was
that
county
which
i
submit
the
attorney
general
was
directing
new
york’s
attention
to
in
disapproving
the
1972
lines.
so,
i
do
not
think
we
can,
in
fairness,
reduce
for
the
purposes
of
enlarging
the
claim
of
mr.
lewin’s
white
clients
reduce
the
focus
of
this
case
beyond
the
general
confines
of
the
county
of
brooklyn
in
which
whites
and
the
memory
of
man
runneth
not
to
the
contrary
has
been
overwhelmingly
the
dominant
group,
all
for
countywide
officers,
four
president,
district
attorney,
two
city
councilmen
are
white,
five
of
brooklyn’s
six
congress
persons
are
white.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
it
is
my
feeling
mr.
justice
stevens
that
the
solicitor
general
has
persuasively
demonstrated
to
me
at
least
that
building
on
the
doctrine
of
gaffney
and
cummings,
new
york
would
be
entitled
to
undertake
in
furtherance
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
to
undertake,
to
create
the
possibility
of
effective
political
action,
by
no
means
a
guarantee
of
it,
and
i
think
certainly
this
was
not
accomplished
here
where
many
whites
were
elected
in
minority,
in
black,
porto
rican
majority
districts,
to
create
the
possibility
of
effective
political
action
for
groups
which
are
not
simply
the
democratic
or
republican
groups
identified
in
gaffney
and
cummings,
but
other
groupings
of
a
kinds
which
are
linked
politically
in
the
vary
way
suggested
in
your
opinion
mr.
justice
stevens
which
i
with
all
apologies
refer
to
again
even
though
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion.
so,
i
think
gaffney
and
cummings
would
independently
support
new
york’s
action,
had
new
york
acted
unprodded
by
the
voting
rights
act,
but
of
course
the
reality
of
this
case
is
that
new
york
moved
because
the
attorney
general
had
disapproved
the
1972
lines,
and
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
new
york’s
using
race
as
an
index
of
how
to
correct
the
imbalances
which
the
attorney
general
had
discerned
in
the
1972
lines,
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
new
york
not
only
was
entitled
but
indeed
obliged
to
look
to
race
to
make,
to
remedy
what
had
been
after
all
racial
abuses.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
justice
rehnquist
were
there
time
enough
i
would
be
glad
to
try
to
demonstrate
that
the
attorney
general
was
right,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
our
burden
or
any
of
respondent’s
burden
in
this
case.
the
determination
was
made
by
the
attorney
general.
it
was
reviewable,
and
the
state
of
new
york
sought
to
review
it
and
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
when
the
politically
entity
which
is
new
york
shows
not
to
do
so,
the
attorney
general’s
disposition
became
a
final
one,
not
i
think
to
be
collaterally
reviewed
here.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
it
does
not
in
my
view
raise
any
such
problems
mr.
justice
brennan.
assuming
i
were
sure
from
the
court’s
delphic
silence
what
a
diaphanous
type
problem
is.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
no,
if
the
court
please,
i
do
not,
and
specifically
if
i
may
say
the
fact
which
is
the
predicate
of
this
case
that
there
was
disapproval
by
the
attorney
general
under
the
voting
rights
act
puts
this
case
in
a
position
where
a
fortiori
the
state
of
new
york
was
not
merely
empowered
but
obliged
to
proceed
with
the
race
of
voting
districts
in
mind.
directly
as
to
diaphanous
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
a
preference
was
given
to
one
assertively
at
the
expense
of
another.
this
was
a
case
in
which
all
it
was
attempted
as
i
understand,
taking
mr.
lewin’s
case
at
its
strongest,
all
it
was
attempted
was
to
create
a
viable
opportunity
for
blacks
and
porto
ricans
to
organize
themselves
politically.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
that
certainly
would
bear
on
the
question
of
the
fact,
but
even
as
to
purpose,
the
validity
of
a
purpose
to
improve
the
possibility
of
minority
political
action.
the
constitutional
validity
of
such
a
purpose,
was
i
think
pretended
mr.
justice
white
not
merely
by
your
question
to
mr.
lewin,
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
voting
rights
act,
but
indeed
as
my
colleague
mr.
schnapper
has
pointed
out
to
me
exactly
what
was
illustrated
by
your
hypothetical
question
was
of
record
in
the
beer
case
decided
by
this
court
last
year.
mr.
schnapper
has
pointed
me
to
pages
341
to
2
of
the
record
in
the
beer
case,
in
which
it
turns
out
that
the
lines
which
this
court
felt
the
attorney
general
should
not
have
disapproved,
those
lines
were
in
part
constructed,
the
record
makes
it
absolutely
plain,
in
order
to
effect
some
deliberate
marginal
improvement
of
the
opportunity
of
black
voters
in
new
orleans
to
vote.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
and
without
any
constitutional
compulsion.
the
voting
rights
act,
your
honor,
i
agree,
goes
beyond
the
mandate
of
the
constitution
of
the
untied
states.
mr.
lewin’s
entire
case
with
respect
to
the
invidious
purpose
of
the
state
of
new
york
rests
not
on
proof
of
what
legislators
intended,
it
rests
on
testimony
of
what
one
staff
assistant
to
a
legislator
said,
and
indeed
the
allegations
or
mr.
lewin’s
complaint
do
not
directly
link
the
legislature
of
new
york,
except
vicariously
without
attributed.
and
again
i
repeat,
“the
entire
proof”
comes
up
on
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
and
surely
this
truncated
record
could
not
be
responsible
basis
for
this
court
making
a
deliberate
adjudication
of
a
case
which
purports
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
action
taken
by
the
sovereign
legislature
of
new
york
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
i
would
not
like
to
conduct
the
trial
portended
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
to
mr.
lewin,
in
which
legislators
of
new
york
are
called
to
the
witness
stand
to
testify
as
to
what
their
purpose
was
in
enacting
these
laws.
suffice
it
to
say
there
is
no
such
testimony
here,
and
it
has,
i
think,
in
this
court’s
unbroken
and
understandable
wish
ever
since
fletcher
versus
peck
to
avoid
inquiries
of
that
kind
and
yet
they
would
be
necessary
where
this
case
to
be
pursued.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
all
we
can
say
--
and
i
do
call
attention
to
the
details
of
mr.
lewin’s
complaint.
i
think
all
we
can
say
is
that
even
mr.
lewin
and
his
complaint
only
asserts
that
the
65%
quota
was
an
opinion
communicated
to
employees
of
the
joint
committee.
i
am
referring
to
paragraphs
22
through
24
of
mr.
lewin’s
complaint.
the
attribution
to
the
legislature
as
such
is
not
i
think
made
by
the
record
before
this
court.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
if
i
am
chary
of
trespassing
on
my
friend,
the
solicitor
general’s
time,
but
i
will
simply
take
closing
seconds
to
submit
that
this
is
a
case,
if
the
court
please,
which
cannot
be
decided
in
mr.
lewin’s
favor
on
this
foreshortened
record.
it
is
my
own
belief
that
if
the
court
sees
substantial
constitutional
claims
left,
which
i
do
not
see,
it
must
follow
the
path
of
remand.
for
our
part
we
think
the
complaint
was
properly
dismissed,
because
there
is
not
even
prima
facie
showing
of
invalid
purpose
or
invalid
effect.
this
would
be
true
if
new
york
had
been
acting
un-product
by
the
attorney
general.
it
is
true
a
fortiori
where
what
new
york
did
was
to
legislate
to
achieve
compliance
with
a
congressional
mandate
in
furtherance
of
congress
or
some
power,
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
in
conclusion
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
urge
that
in
this
bicentennial
year,
fidelity
to
the
declaration
of
the
constitution,
those
instruments
of
government
honored
in
this
court,
not
ceremonially
and
not
at
intervals
but
emphatically
and
everyday,
requires
affirmance
of
the
judges
below.
