justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lewin,
in
you
opening
statement
you
said
deliberately.
what
do
you
mean
by
way
of
intent
or
knowledge
or
that
sort
of
thing
by
the
use
of
that
adverb?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
we
adopt
your
principle,
then
i
suppose
in
all
future
cases
like
this
the
committee
chairman,
perhaps
the
legislators
themselves,
could
be
examined
on
depositions
as
to
what
their
primary
motive
was
when
they
voted
this
or
whey
they
sat
on
committee
and
decided
to
recommend
this.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
lay
down
a
principle,
as
you
say
in
this
case,
that
were
the
primary
factor
that
they
considered
was
what
you
have
outlined.
in
any
future
case,
on
the
basis
of
normal
rules
of
evidence,
you
are
going
to
open
up
to
prove
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiffs
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
or
that
was
the
primary
in
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
not
the
same
thing
to
say
that
irish,
and
hasidic
jews
and
so
forth
are
not
protected
as
a
minority
and
to
say
that
whites
as
a
minority
are
not
protected,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
the
new
york
legislature
had
been
proceeding
on
a
general
gaffney
against
cummings
approach
but
one
of
their
sub-hypotheses
was
that
blacks
and
porto
ricans
in
brooklyn
tend
to
vote
democratic,
and
therefore,
we
are
going
to
create
a
couple
of
democratic
districts
and
the
way
we
will
do
this
is
to
include
65%
of
blacks,
proto
ricans,
and
others.
would
there
be
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
pollak
then
there
is
the
constitutional
stature
of
the
claim
turn
on
the
racial
make
up
of
the
county.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
whites?
it
all
depends
on
what
statistics
you
use
i
suppose.
what
about
the
two
assembly
districts
in
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bexar
it
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
white
versus
regester
mr.
pollak,
the
question
was
at
large
districts
for
a
county,
well,
was
it
not
that
the
reason
why
the
analysis
was
confined
to
bexar
county,
here
you
don’t
have
districts
at
large.
you
have
single
member
districts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
entitled
to
rely
simply
on
the
attorney
general’s
finding
as
to
1972?
in
this
lawsuit,
are
you
required
to
make
some
showing
that
in
fact
what
he
found
was
justified
under
the
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
government’s
interest
in
the
merits
of
the
plaintiff’s
constitutional
claim
if
the
status
of
the
attorney
general
as
a
party
has
put
to
one
side?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
to
achieve
rough
proportionality,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
anything
that
was
done
by
new
york
in
response
to
the
attorney
general’s
recommendation
would
automatically
be
entitled
to
the
word
remedial
rather
than
invidious
or
discriminatory?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
have
to
do
a
fair
amount
of
employing,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
as
to
a
permanent
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
posture
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
simply
appeal
from
preliminary
injunction,
but
appeal
for
the
denial
of
a
permanent
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
alright.
