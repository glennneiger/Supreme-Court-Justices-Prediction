mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
constitutional
issue
presented
by
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
whether
a
legislative
apportionment
which
deliberately
limits
the
white
population
of
certain
assembly
and
senate
districts
for
new
york
state
to
not
more
than
35%
of
the
total
number
of
citizens
in
each
of
those
districts
is
consistent
with
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
a
majority
of
the
court
below,
two
judges,
said
that
our
argument
that
such
districting
is
unconstitutional
has
“intellectual
appeal
on
the
surface”,
and
even
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
says
that
our
contention
has
“considerable
superficial
appeal”.
each
then
proceeds
with
an
involved
effort
to
justify
what
was
done
here
by
the
new
york
legislature.
in
each
case,
we
submit
the
effort
simply
fails.
we
believe
that
the
instinctive
response
to
this
set
of
facts,
the
simple
reaction
that
such
a
districting
scheme
cannot
be
correct
and
cannot
be
constitutionally
valid
is
the
proper
result,
and
that
the
contrary
view
is
not
what
congress
contemplated
in
the
voting
rights
act
and
not
what
is
contemplated
by
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
by
the
use
of
that
adverb,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
mean
that
the
individuals
drawing
that
line
had
that
as
the
primary
and
dominant
criterion
in
their
mind.
they
said
not
the
result
of
what
we
have
done
is
by
happen
stands
or
because
it
is
one
of
many
factors
to
produce
a
not
more
than
35%
white
citizenry
in
that
district,
but
that
is
what
we
are
going
to
achieve,
that
is
what
we
intent
to
achieve.
districts
that
will
have
not
more
than
35%
whites
in
them,
and
that
is
what
i
mean
by
deliberate.
i
think
more
so
than
any
other
that
has
previously
been
before
this
court
where
allegations
of
racial
gerrymandering
have
been
made,
the
record
in
this
case
is
undisputed.
i
think
there
is
really
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
individual
responsible
for
drawing
the
lines
did
it
for
that
reason,
and
i
would
say,
almost
that
reason
only,
that
is
why
the
line
was
drawn.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
in
the
ordinary
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
a
lot
of
difficulty
in
determining
what
such
a
motive
is,
that
is
why
this
court
has
prevented
interrogations
or
investigations
of
legislative
motive,
because
there
is
a
variety
of
motives
that
combine
to
produce
a
particular
result,
and
there
is
really
no
way
to
knowing
what
a
legislature
has
done,
but
in
this
case,
there
is
just
no
question.
where,
in
the
unique
cases
as
this
one
is,
where
the
legislative
purpose
is
set
out
and
is
stated
in
the
legislative
record,
and
is
not
disputed,
we
believe
it
is
entirely
proper
for
the
court
to
say,
may
a
legislature
do
this,
is
it
permissible
for
a
legislature
to
act
in
that
way.
we
think
on
that
account
that
our
claim
is
really
quite
different
from
what
the
white
respondents
would
like
to
characterize
our
claim.
both
the
solicitor
general
and
the
naacp,
which
is
intervener
in
this
case
in
its
brief,
have
been
asserting
i
think
throughout
that
our
contention
is
that
legislators
may
not
take
account
in
some
way
that
legislators
of
course
do
in
the
real
world
of
what
the
racial
distribution
is
of
districts
which
result
from
apportionment.
we
are
not
saying
that
they
may
not
review
a
census
maturity
when
others
know
what
is
happening.
what
our
argument
is,
is
that
that
may
not
the
criterion,
the
principle
standard
and
guideline
that
they
are
using.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
absolutely
right
mr.
chief
justice.
in
this
case
there
are
no
subjective
factors;
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
must
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
courts
can
setup
a
threshold
which
you
have
to
meet
with
the
preliminary
showing
before
you
can
engage
in
such
an
investigation.
i
do
not
think
we
are
suggesting
that
it
would
be
open
for
any
plaintiff
and
come
in
and
say,
i
will
put
the
entire
legislature
on
the
stand
and
interrogate
them
as
to
their
motive.
in
this
case
we
have
i
think
from
the
legislative
report
itself
from
the
undisputed
history
of
how
this
apportionment
developed
the
necessary
inference
that
any
court
and
indeed
the
defendants
i
think
admitted
as
much
in
their
answer.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
think
it
would
mr.
chief
justice
and
we
would
accept
that
test
certainly
that
where
it
appears
on
the
face
of
the
reports
on
the
legislative
record
that
that
is
what
the
legislature
is
doing
then
it
is
impermissible.
and
then
maybe
the
burden
falls
on
the
other
side
which
was
represented
in
court.
i
mean
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
really
that
we
filed
this
suit
against
the
attorney
general.
we
are
here
being
challenged
in
this
court
over
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
is
a
party.
well,
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
suit
was
filed
against
the
attorney
general
was
precisely
to
afford
all
parties
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
explain
whether
there
was
any
justification
for
this
and
there
was
no
justification
for
this
apportionment
and
no
justification
for
what
preceded.
and
that
is
why
the
record
comes
to
this
court
in
its
present
state,
where
the
facts
are
undisputed
and
lead
invariably
to
that
one
conclusion.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
are
two
reasons
why
we
could
not
do
that:
one
is
that
unfortunately
the
state,
because
of
the
exigencies
of
time,
never
challenged.
they
never
took
it
to
court,
and
when
several
legislators
who
were
dissatisfied
with
what
the
attorney
general
had
done,
had
instituted
a
suit
in
the
district
court.
it
was
dismissed
for
the
lack
of
standing.
but
the
second
more
important
reason
really
is
that
we
did
not
know,
my
clients
did
not
know
what
the
product
was
going
to
be
of
the
attorney
general’s
decision.
it
was
not
until
the
new
york
state
assembly
sat
down
in
several
very
frenzy
days
in
may
and
determined
that
they
were
going
to
draw
the
line
in
these
legislative
districts
in
such
a
manner
that
this
community
will
split
in
half
between
two
districts
that
we
even
knew
what
had
happened.
that
we
even
knew
that
there
was
anything
to
complain
about.
we
would,
simply
along
with
all
other
citizens
of
new
york,
possibly
or
many
of
the
citizens
of
new
york
have
supported
the
72
reapportionment,
but
until
the
74
reapportionment
was
enacted
we
just
did
not
know
what
it
was
going
to
do
to
us.
let
me
just
briefly
then
describe
what
exactly
happened
with
these
apportionment
and
then
proceed
to
outline
the
relationship
between
the
74
apportionment
and
the
prior
attorney
general’s
decision
under
the
voting
rights
act,
relations
that
is
important
both
to
our
position
and
to
that
of
the
respondents.
the
page
173
of
the
appendix
in
this
court
appears,
a
large
map
of
the
borough
of
brooklyn
and
its
assembly
districts.
mr.
nathan
lewin
page
173
of
the
appendix.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
area
that
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
litigation
is
the
one
that
appears
at
the
upper
most,
the
northern
section
of
the
district’s
marked
57
and
56.
it
is
really
a
triangular
area
that
runs
just
above
the
united
states
navy
yard
and
is
divided
under
this
1970
reapportionment
by
the
heavy
black
line
that
divides
lines
57
and
56,
and
it
is
in
that
area,
that
triangle
where
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
reside.
now
when
that
map
is
compared
with
the
assembly
line
map
that
appears
at
page
197
of
the
record,
then
it
is
quite
plain
what
has
happened
by
reason
of
the
1974
apportionment.
page
197
of
the
record
contains
the
assembly
lines
as
they
appeared
under
the
1972
reapportionment.
the
entire
triangular
section
on
page
197
is
all
included
within
assembly
district
number
57,
so
that
under
the
1972
district
--
the
map
is
headed
borough
of
brooklyn
city
of
new
york
1971
and
it
is
marked
at
plaintiff's
exhibit
four
but
that
was
a
1972
reapportionment.
that
triangular
section
was
all
within
the
57th
assembly
district.
mr.
nathan
lewin
this
section
right
there
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
nathan
lewin
which
is
in
the
upper
northeast
corner
of
the
57th
assembly
district
under
the
1972
reapportionment,
and
up
here
it
splits
between
the
56th
and
57th
districts
under
the
1974
reapportionment.
i
will
not
refer
at
this
time
to
the
corresponding
senate
districts
which
appear
at
pages
174
and
198
of
the
record,
but
they
do
the
same
thing.
they
do
the
same
thing.
in
the
1972
reapportionment
that
triangular
section
was
all
in
the
17th
senate
district
and
in
the
1974
apportionment
it
was
divided
by
a
line
drawn
approximately
at
the
same
place
as
the
assembly
line
between
the
23rd
and
25th
assembly
districts,
senate
districts
i
am
sorry,
23rd
and
25th
senate
districts.
what
was
the
effect
of
that
drawing
of
lines
on
the
population
in
those
districts?
the
assembly
districts
under
the
1972
reapportionment
in
which
the
plaintiffs
had
found
themselves
was
38.5%
white,
in
other
words
61.5%
nonwhite
according
to
the
testimony
below.
the
plaintiffs
were
in
a
minority,
but
a
minority
that
was
greater
than
35%,
in
their
assembly
district
under
the
1972
apportionment.
in
order
to
achieve
compliance
with
what
the
department
of
justice
thought
was
an
inadequate
racial
distribution,
they
were
split
into
two
assembly
districts
in
one
of
which
the
white
population
was
under
12%,
11.9%,
and
in
the
other
one
of
the
which
it
was
exactly
35%,
precisely
in
order
to
meet,
and
the
testimony
here
in
the
record
by
the
man
who
drew
the
lines
was
that
he
went
block
by
block
until
he
achieved
precisely
65%
nonwhite
population,
and
that
is
why
both
assembly
districts
now
in
which
the
plaintiffs
find
themselves
are
35%
or
less
white.
they
were,
under
the
1972
apportionment
in
a
senate
district
that
was
approximately
65%
white
that
was
the
17th
senate
district.
they
are
now,
under
the
1974
apportionment,
in
two
districts
one
of
which
is
28.9%,
under
30%.
the
other
one
of
which
is
approximately
the
same
as
the
other,
the
earlier
17th
senate
district,
it
is
65%
white.
so,
they
are
now
in
two
senate
districts
one
of
which
with
a
very
small
white
population,
again
meeting
that
65:35
standard,
under
30%.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
record
certainly
contains
no
uncertainty.
the
mr.
scolaro
testified
that
he
had
several
meetings
with
representatives
of
the
department
of
justice.
he
testified
i
think
in
some
detail
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
the
nature
of
the
conversation.
he
said
we
have
talked
to
--
i
asked
them
what
percentage
is
needed,
and
they
said…
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
it
was,
and
i
said
it
is
70%
of
white,
this
is
at
page
105
of
the
appendix.
i
said,
how
much
higher
do
you
really
have
to
go,
and
his
point
was
--
one
of
these
districts
is
61.5%
nonwhite,
how
much
higher
do
you
have
to
go?
is
70%
alright?
they
did
not
say
yes
or
not,
but
they
indicated
it
is
more
inline
with
the
way
we
think
in
order
to
affect
the
possibility
of
a
minority
candidate
being
elected
within
that
district.
i
suggested
65%.
it
came
out
at
that
time
that
is
a
figure
used
by
naacp
in
numerous
briefs
and
other
documents.
so,
it
was
the
product
of
his
discussions.
at
other
portions
of
his
testimony,
he
indicated
that
it
was
entirely
as
a
result
of
those
discussions,
although
he
could
not
pinpoint
a
particular
conversation
that
he
came
away
with
the
65%
figure.
now,
the
department
of
justice,
again
i
have
to
emphasize,
was
present
at
this
hearing.
there
was
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
at
the
hearing.
united
states
department
of
justice
had
every
opportunity
to
put
on
attorneys
of
the
department
of
justice
civil
rights
division
if
they
made
no
such
suggestion
to
mr.
scolaro
and
to
refute
that
testimony.
mr.
scolaro
was,
by
no
means,
a
friendly
witness.
he
was
the
man
who
had
drawn
the
lines
for
the
new
york
state
assembly
district.
there
was
only
silence
from
the
department
of
justice,
and
now
in
the
appellate
stages,
both
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court,
everyone
is
pointing
the
finger
at
everyone
else.
the
department
of
justice
says,
well
no
the
state
people
did
it,
we
just
said
the
old
one
was
no
good,
and
the
state
people
are
saying,
well,
no
we
thought
the
old
reapportionment
was
fine,
it
was
only
those
people
of
department
of
justice,
and
then
the
plaintiffs
are
told,
well,
you
cannot
sue
the
attorney
general
and
you
do
not
have
any
claim
against
the
state
officials
either
to
remedy
this
dictated
quota
which
somebody
clearly
imposed
because
it
was
definitely
used
on
a
block-by-block
basis…
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
initial
agrument,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
yes
that
in
every
instance
racial
quotas
are
improper
in
reapportionment
cases.
it
would
be
appropriate
and
we
try
to
point
up
an
analogy
to
within
the
employment
situation.
it
would
be
appropriate,
we
think,
for
a
legislature
to
say,
we
are
drawing
up
a
districting
scheme
and
we
will
look
to
see
what
effect
that
districting
scheme
has
on
racial
distribution.
if
it
seems
to
have
as
an
employee
or
might
by
looking
at
his
workforce
say,
look
this
seems
to
work
a
diminution
of
what
should
be
minority
voting,
we
have
to
make
corrections.
i
think
in
those
circumstances
it
maybe
a
test,
it
maybe
looked
to,
it
maybe
considered.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
try
mr.
justice
brennan,
think
of
possibility
where
there
might
be
a
justification
and
i
am
hard-pressed
and
i
do
not
think
that
respondents
have
come
up
with
any
suggestion
of
a
justification
of
something
that
might
warrant
a
legislature
from
saying,
we
will
apply
a
quota
in
the
voting
area,
because
we
think…
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
your
honor
i
think…
mr.
nathan
lewin
probably
under
this
court’s
decision,
certainly
under
georgia
and
united
states
and
the
shift
of
the
burden
of
proof
that
has
authorized
under
it
--
section
5
goes
beyond
the
constitution
probably.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
do
not
think
we
are
suggesting,
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
reach
it
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
unusual
cases,
i
think
the
annexation
cases
or
another
set
of
situation
where
it
might
be
possible…
mr.
nathan
lewin
right,
richmond
and
the
city
of
petersburg
where
it
might
be
possible
to
think
of
a
reason,
an
unusual
situation
where…
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
do
not
think
we
have
to
reach
that
case
on
these
facts
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
the
general
rule
is
to
reapportionment
accepted…
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
certainly
a
very
heavy
burden
against
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
absolutely,
that
is
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
true.
we
think
in
this
case
the…
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
but
the
only
thing
that
complies…
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
the
argument,
but
the
only
that
compliance
with
section
5
required
was
that
new
york
enacts
a
statue,
which
it
could
sustain
if
not
through
the
attorney
general,
through
the
declaratory
judgment
action
in
a
federal
court.
the
attorney
general
made
no
finding
that
the
earlier
statue
and
this
is
our
second
argument,
that
the
attorney
general
made
nor
finding
that
the
earlier
statute
did
have
the
effect
of
discriminating
on
account
of
litigation.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
the
court
had
said,
yes
you
have
to
draw
it
on
the
basis
of
race
with
a
35%
quota,
yes
i
would.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
then
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
the
court
so
held
in
that
case,
yes
i
would
be
arguing
here
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
we
think
that
the
court
would
not
have
so
held.
if
beer
indicated
anything,
beer
indicated,
we
think,
that
the
decision
by
the
attorney
general
in
1972
was
erroneous.
it
was
erroneous
for
variety
of
reasons.
there
certainly
was
no
suggestion
in
the
attorney
general’s
letter
or
the
assistant
attorney
general’s
letter
of
april,
1974
with
regards
to
the
1972
apportionment
that
it
was
worse
than
any
prior
apportionment,
than
the
1966
apportionment
with
respect
to
race.
it
had
the
standards
that
is
now
been
made
clear
by
this
court
under
the
beer
case
applied.
at
that
time
the
assistant
attorney
general’s
findings
in
the
letter
would
have
been
totally
irrelevant.
they
just
do
not
relate
to
the
issue
that
this
court
has
now
said
section
5
applies
to.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
purpose.
well,
we
think
at
the
moment
your
honor
the
thing
has
skipped
my
mind.
if
i
could
look
at
it
over
the
lunch
recess,
i
will
recall
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
i
would
like
to
be
able
just
to
read
that
opinion
again
over
the
lunch
recess
if
i
could
reply
to
it
after
lunch.
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
view
is
that
they
certainly
could
not
that
if
that
were
true
then
the
argument
that
the
respondents
made
based
gaffney
and
cummings
would
be
somewhat
closer
to
this
case.
one
distinction
that
we
think
exists
between
this
case
and
this
court’s
opinion
in
gaffney
is
that
gaffney
was
a
determined
legislative
judgment
to
apportion
in
a
certain
manner.
this
court
said
it
will
not
strike
that
down.
now,
of
course
we
will
argue
that
gaffney
is
distinguishable
because
gaffney
was
apportionment
based
on
political
ideology
rather
than
race,
but
if
race
were
the
factor,
we
think
that
would
be
impermissible.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
that
your
honor’s
opinion
dissenting
in
the
cousin’s
case,
in
466
f.
2d.
we
think
does
demonstrate
precisely
that
that
is
impressible
not
only
with
regard
to
blacks,
but
with
regard
to
other
minorities,
with
regard
to
this
white
community
of
williamsburgh,
which
was
and
is
a
racial
minority
in
the
district
where
it
resides.
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
over
the
luncheon
recess
i
have
done
my
homework
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
read
washington
versus
davis
which
it
appears
to
me
does
affect
this
case
in
one
major
way,
and
in
another
subsidiary
way.
the
court
did
hold
of
course
in
washington
versus
davis
that
all
statistical
proof
goes
to
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
there
has
been
purposeful
discrimination
and
that
that
is
the
constitutional
text.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
decision
in
washington
and
davis
and
the
opinion
is
consistent
in
that
regard
with
our
position
that
it
is
really
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
consider
the
statistical
impact
of
any
particular
apportionment
if
the
record
is
as
clear
as
it
is
here
on
there
being
a
discriminatory
purpose.
in
fact,
at
the
end
of
the
court’s
opinion
in
the
city
of
richmond
case
as
well,
the
court
adverted
in
that
opinion
to
the
fact
that
even
perfectly
legal
results,
even
statistics
which
would
stand
analysis
if
examined
to
see
what
their
effect
would
be
on
racial
minorities.
it
would
be
impressible,
if
they
are
done
for
racially
discriminatory
purposes.
the
court
viewed
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
as
being
as
it
put
it,
a
gross
racial
slur
which
can
have
no
credentials
whatever,
and
in
that
regard
quoted
from
a
1918
opinion
that
“acts
generally
lawful
may
become
unlawful
when
done
to
accomplish
an
unlawful
end.”
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
is.
we
think,
although
it
was
done
for
benign
purposes,
it
was
a
diminution
of
the
effect
of
a
particular
racial
group
within
the…
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
am
saying
purpose
means
that
when
you
take
a
racial
minority
such
as
the
white
community,
overwhelmingly
jewish,
orthodox
jewish
in
williamsburgh
is
and
you
view
that
minority
in
that
neighborhood.
in
other
words,
i
think
judge
frank
(ph)
below
dissenting
pointed
out
that
one
cannot
look
at
an
entire
county
or
an
entire
city
and
say
well
now
what
is
the
racial
minority
there.
the
question
is
what
is
the
racial
minority
in
the
williamsburgh
section
of
brooklyn?
if,
in
fact,
in
order
to
diminish
the
voting
power
of
the
white
citizens
of
the
williamsburgh
section
of
brooklyn,
the
new
york
legislature
decided
that
it
was
not
going
to
give
them
more
than
35%
population
in
any
one
of
those
districts,
assembly
districts,
then
we
think
that
has
to
come
in.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
is
impressible.
we
have
joined
the
attorney
general
and
the
state
officials
and
we
say
you
cannot
do
that.
you
cannot
say
that
in
order
to
pass
muster
under
section
5
you
will
take
a
racial
minority,
in
this
case
it
is
a
white
racial
minority,
you
will
take
a
racial
minority
and
say
to
them
you
cannot
have
more
than
35%
in
those
districts.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
no.
again,
there
is
a
peculiar
way
that…
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
are
not
only
including
porto
ricans,
but
according
the
new
york
state
legislature
we
are
including
others.
in
other
words,
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
submission
of
the
naacp
and
i
think
that
is
what
is
really
most
disturbing
about
this
s
that
it
is
a
submission
which
argues
that
there
is
the
white
community
and
the
rest
of
the
world,
the
nonwhite
community.
to
anybody
as
judge
frank
(ph)
noted
who
is
familiar
with
new
york,
it
is
pure
fiction
to
speak
of
the
rest
of
that
community,
blacks
and
porto
ricans
as
merged
together
and
others
as
merged
together
in
the
nonwhite
community.
only
if
one
looks
at
it
as
means
of
reducing
the
possibility
of
electing
white
legislators,
the
interesting
thing
is
that
that
emerges
so
clearly
from
the
naacp
submission
to
the
department
of
justice
that
they
speak
over
and
over
again
about
the
white
encumbrance
and
the
need
to
allow
other
than
white
encumbrance
in
the
legislature
in
new
york.
this
was
not
a
measure
or
a
disapproval
based
on
taking
a
particular
racial
minority
such
as
blacks
or
groups
such
as
porto
ricans,
it
was
really
the
department
of
justice
saying
whites
are
simply
not
covered
by
the
fifteenth
amendment
or
by
the
voting
rights
act.
we
have
quoted
in
our
reply
brief
what
strikes
us
as
an
extraordinary
passage
out
of
the
department
of
justice’s
memorandum
justifying
its
approval
of
the
1974
lounge
in
which
they
say
in
the
clearest
language…
mr.
nathan
lewin
this
appears
at
page
12
of
our
reply
brief,
and
it
is
at
page
11
and
12,
it
is
on
page
293
of
the
appendix
in
which
the
department
of
justice
says
clearly
that
in
their
view
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
voting
rights
act
is
not
designed
to
protect
hasidic
jews,
persons
of
irish,
polish,
or
italian
decent,
none
of
those
are
within
the
special
protections
defined
by
the
congress
in
the
voting
rights
act
not
all
within
the
fifteenth
amendment.
that
the
entire
memorandum
focuses
on
the
fact
that
the
only
people
who
are
protected
by
the
voting
rights
act
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
are
blacks
and
porto
ricans.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
whites
as
a
minority
in
a
particular
area
may
happen
to
be
as
they
are
in
this
case
hasidic
jews
or
irish
or
italian.
it
is
true
the
irish
or
italian
as
an
entire
group
may
not
be
protected
but
the
white,
a
white
irish
community
in
a
particular
area
which
ends
up
being
a
minority
is
protected
just
as
white
and
registered,
the
mexican-americans
in
bexar
county.
i
think
this
court
focused
on
the
mexican-americans
in
that
country
not
mexican-americans
in
their
entirety
throughout
the
state,
but
those
that
were
in
the
particular
county
and
said,
as
to
those
they
had
been
denied
rights
protected
by
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
have
never
challenged
the
bona
fides
and
the
good
intentions
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
state
officials.
so,
we
are
granting
that
that…
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
is
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
you
cannot
separate
those.
mr.
nathan
lewin
of
course,
because
that
necessarily
follows,
you
cannot
separate
those
and
the
evils
of
that…
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
mr.
chief
justice
it
mostly
definitely
does
and
we
have
expanded
at
more
length
than
i
suppose
i
have
time
now
to
go
into
on
the
harms
we
think
it
does.
what
it
does
is
it
caters
to
the
notion
that
there
is
racial
polarization
in
voting.
again,
the
naacp…
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
encourages
them
to
move
into
that
area,
it
encourages
voting
on
the
basis
of
race
in
the
ballot
box.
it
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
anderson
and
martin
would
not
be
permitted
if
you
can
have
a
racial
designation
on
a
ballot
in
order
to
get
the
black
community
to
vote
for
black
candidates.
one
would
think
that
might
very
well
help
the
election
of
blacks
and
yet
this
court
has
said
the
state
may
not
make
that
an
element
in
the
electoral
process.
in
fact,
the
interesting
thing
is
the
statistics
that
emerge
from
the
naacp
brief,
they
are
not
in
the
record
because
this
happen
after
the
case
below,
but
the
naacp
has
in
its
brief
the
statistics
regarding
the
consequences
of
the
vote
in
1974,
and
it
says,
in
1974,
after
this
apportionment,
there
were
nonwhites
elected
in
the
three
senatorial
districts,
this
appears
at
pages
26
and
27
in
the
naacp
brief,
in
the
three
senatorial
districts
which
will
made
overwhelmingly
nonwhite
and
in
the
seven
assembly
districts,
all
of
which
were
made
overwhelmingly
nonwhite.
that
gave
blacks
really
a
43%
of
the
representation
of
kings
county
substantially
over
the
24%
black
population.
but
the
interesting
thing
is
that
according
to
the
footnote
that
happened
in
1974
but
it
did
not
happen
since.
in
other
words,
in
the
subsequent
election,
according
to
the
naacp
whites
now
represent
also
two
of
the
assembly
districts
that
are
overwhelmingly
black
and
two
of
the
senate
districts.
although
originally,
i
think
precisely
because
this
emphasis
was
placed
on
getting
black
or
nonwhite
districts
voters
were
being
encouraged
to
go
into
that
ballot
box
and
vote
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
that
is
we
think
squarely
contrary
to
what
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
designed
to
encourage.
they
are
designed
to
encourage
voting
on
the
basis
of
individual
merits
of
candidates
and
not
things
such
as
race,
and
that
distinguishes
gaffney
and
cummings
as
well.
gaffney
and
cummings
was
a
deliberate
apportionment
according
to
the
candidates,
democratic
and
republican
candidates.
whether
a
candidate
is
a
democrat
or
a
republican
appears
on
the
ballot.
the
state
encourages
voting
on
the
basis
of
political
affiliation.
that
is
part
of
our
political
process.
anderson
and
martin
had
said
you
cannot
put
on
the
ballot
the
race
of
a
candidate.
you
cannot
put
on
the
ballot
the
ethnic
identification
of
a
candidate.
obviously
those
are
things
which
would
be
encouraging
voters
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
criteria
which
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
were
designed
to
override,
and
yet
the
solicitor
general
and
the
state
and
the
interveners
here
are
arguing
that
a
racial
fairness
formula
is
perfectly
appropriate.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
it
would
be
a
valid
criterion.
we
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
criteria
that
are
always
applied
mr.
justice
stevens
by
people
who
draw
the
lines.
they
decide
where
are
the
communities,
what
have
been
traditional
boundaries?
that
kind
of
thing
has
been
used
in
the
past
and
we
think
is
a
permissible
criterion.
so,
we
think
our
legislature
could
use
that,
but
i
think
we
have
to…
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
they
should
preserve
existing
groups
irrespective
of
whether
the
voters
are
blacks.
i
think
the
neighborhood…
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
there
are
various
interests.
one
interest
one
can
think
of
is
simply
that
in
the
electoral
process
there
are
ways
that
candidates
having
reaching
voters
through
their
community
groups.
in
other
words,
a
candidate
goes
in
and
says,
well
now
i
will
speak,
it
maybe
in
a
synagogue,
it
maybe
in
a
hall
or
lodge
or
an
ethnic
center
of
some
kind
and
that
has
traditionally
done
by
candidates.
so,
it
makes
sense
from
a
totally
neutral
legislative
standpoint
to
say
we
would
like
to
preserve
that
so
that
the
candidates
can
get
their
message
through
to
the
voters.
even
they
do
not
vote
as
a
black
but
that
all
the
candidates
should
be
able
to
get
through
to
the
voters
through
these
various
(voice
overlap).
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
it
could,
but
we
are
not
arguing
that
it
must.
i
think
one
thing
that
would
impact…
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
it
may,
i
think
it
may
because
of
perfectly
neutral
reasons
that
have
to
do
simply
with
candidates
and
their
availability
or
accessibility
to
the
voters,
and
with
i
think
traditional
reapportionment
standards.
i
think
a
legislature
may
say
various
elements
and
criteria
enter
into
apportionment
and
this
court
noted
in
gaffney
that
it
is
not
a
mindless
process.
obviously,
legislators
and
those
who
make
determinations
make
these
judgments
on
the
basis
of
a
wide
variety
of
factors,
and
they
could
and
should
consider
communities
as
well
as
other
factors.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
this
court
has
sustained
in
gaffney
and
we
certainly
do
not
challenge.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
we
think
politics
is
part
of
the
political
process;
race
is
not
part
of
the
political
process.
race
is
an
impressible
standard
except
when
it
is
being
used
--
it
can
be
struck
down
when
it
is
being
used
to
reduce
the
voting
effectiveness
of
voters.
that
relates
to
anther
factor
which
is
that
everybody,
the
interveners
in
this
case,
and
i
think
the
majority
below,
kind
of
assume
that
there
is
a
necessarily
relation
between
the
voting
power
of
nonwhites
and
the
race
of
the
candidates
who
are
elected.
we
think
that
that
is
just
not
true
and
that
also
was
impressible
under
our
standards.
we
think
blacks
or
nonwhites
may
have
and
should
have
voting
power
but
that
does
not
mean
that
that
is
tested
by
saying
how
many
there
are
or...
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
would
be
there.
the
court,
the
majority
below
said
in
a
footnote
that
is
at
page
27a
of
our
petition,
footnote
20,
factfully
said
the
majority
in
the
sort
of
wistful
footnote,
more
and
more
we
are
coming
to
the
day
when
the
american
voters
vote
person
or
party
or
issue
and
not
color
or
race
or
sex,
until
that
idyllic
day
all
voters
do
this
however.
voting
rights
act
or
fifteenth
amendment
will
be
necessary
until
that
idyllic
day.
we
submit
that
the
way
to
get
to
that
idyllic
day
is
to
say
the
sate
may
not
encourage
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
the
legislature’s
objective
is
political,
we
think
that
is
permissible
under
gaffney
and
cummings,
even
though
they
may
use
racial
criteria
in
determining
how
the
political
affiliation
is
arrived
at.
now,
i
think
there
are
other,
i
mean
as
i
think
of
the
hypothesis
that
you
put
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
suppose
since
the
legislature
had
other
ways
of
determining
democratic
and
republican
affiliation
such
as
registration
statistics,
it
might
be
an
impermissible
way
of
getting
what
is
really
registration
statistics,
but
i
would
think
initially
if
the
legislature
is
saying
what
we
are
doing
is
looking
to
make
a
political
distribution
that
is
a
permissible
distribution.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
do
not
know
how…
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
think
from
the
statistics
that
i
see
in
naacp
brief
there
were
43%...
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
in
kings
country
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
think
it
was
43%
as
my
statistics
work
it
out
for
black
or…
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
the
total
number
of
blacks
was
24%
and
as
i
read
it
from
the
statistics,
it
appears
to
be
43%
black
representatives
from
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
is
the
conclusion
i
can
come
to
from
the
footnote
mr.
justice
white
but
that
is
not
what
our
case
turns
out.
we
do
not
say
that
it
depends
on
whether
that
is
shown
or
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
really
what
we
say
you
have
to
focus
on
is
not
what
the
total
was
in
the
community.
you
have
got
to
focus
on
this
community
in
williamsburgh.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
might
just
take
almost
just
one
three
points
i
think
that
came
up
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
course
of
the
respondents’
argument.
first
on,
rereading
the
naacp’s
brief
and
its
footnote,
i
have
to
apologize
to
the
court,
i
did
misunderstand
the
word
succeeding
election
that
appeared
in
that
brief,
and
read
it
to
assume
that
there
was
an
election
since,
which
of
course
i
should
have
realized
there
was
not.
in
fact,
therefore,
the
statement
i
made
to
the
court
about
the
election
of
black
candidates
was
in
error
and
is
not
what
the
naacp
brief
indicates,
and
i
would
just
like
to
withdraw
that.
but
i
think
those
statistics
do
indicate
that
if
the
overwhelmingly
nonwhite
district
had
in
fact
voted
the
way
the
naacp
suggested,
there
would
have
been
overwhelmingly
disproportionate,
i
believe,
black
representation.
let
me
make
just
a
brief
response
to
mr.
pollak’s
point
regarding
the
inadequacy
of
the
record.
we
made
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
below
and
our
statement
is
to
point
as
to
which
there
is
no
genuine
issue
appears
at
259
of
the
record.
the
state
respondents
did
not
put
any
of
those
questions
in
issue.
the
naacp
put
some
of
them
in
issue,
but
we
think
not
those
really
that
would
dispose
of
this
case.
we
believe
our
motion
to
summary
judgment
on
the
undisputed
facts
should
have
and
could
have
been
granted.
it
is
simply
not
true
that
this
record
in
its
present
posture
requires
any
remand
for
any
further
hearing
if
those
points
are
read
and
if
the
complaint
and
the
state
answer
which
appears
in
the
appendix
are
both
read.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
your
honor.
we
moved
on
the
basis
of
the
record
made
on
the
motion
of
preliminary
injunction.
we
moved
thereafter
for
summary
judgment.
there
was
a
response
to
it
filed
by
the
naacp,
none
to
my
recollection
filed
by
the
state.
the
court
denied
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
appealed.
we
asked
as
part
of
our
appeal
at
the
court
of
appeals
grant
our
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
record
is
in
posture
where
we
think
we
are
entitled
to
summary
judgment
based
on
the
undisputed
testimony.
at
that
hearing,
where
there
was
ample
notice,
it
was
not
a
hearing
that
was
called
without
notice,
i
think
there
were
several
days,
our
witnesses
had
testified,
they
called
no
witnesses.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
the
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
a
complaint.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
motion
for
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
was
granted.
finally,
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
very
much
overstated
our
position
by
saying
that
we
urge
that
the
voting
rights
act
be
overruled
and
that
race
be
ignored.
we
made
no
such
argument.
we
said
clearly
as
in
employment
cases,
it
is
proper
for
a
state
to
look
at
race
to
decide
what
its
apportionment
has
done.
it
is
not
proper
to
make
race
the
criterion
which
is
really,
and
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
record,
that
was
the
standard
that
was
used
here
by
the
new
york
legislature.
