i
suppose
when
read
this
record
really
as
that
what
was
done
that
was
done
only
because
otherwise
it
could
not
have
been
a
section
5
clearance
from
the
attorney
general.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
the
only
reason
for
it
is
being
done.
i
suppose
one
read
the
record
that
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
actually
it
was
the
other
way
around,
wasn't
it?
if
what
we
are
told
and
what
you
rather
said
earlier,
what
happened
was,
it
is
not
that
you
can
have
only
35%
whites
that
you
must
65%
blacks.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
of
course
you
have
got
the
blacks
here
that
we
are
including
among
blacks,
porto
ricans
only.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
page
this
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
you
do
that
mr.
lewin?
there
are
x
number
of
assemblymen,
x
number
of
senators
in
kings
county
that
is
all
the
brooklyn,
and
that
the
number
of
black
senators,
the
number
of
black
assemblymen
was
a
higher
percentage
than
the
total
number
of
blacks
in
the
county,
is
that
it?
