chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-104,
united
jewish
organization
against
carey.
i
think
you
may
proceed
now
whenever
you
are
ready
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here
you
don’t
have
to
call
on
any
subjective
factors,
that
is
what
you
are
saying,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
do
not
need
to
go
beyond
the
proposition
that
where
it
appears
on
the
face
of
the
legislative
record
that
this
was
the
purpose.
would
that
take
care
of
the
subjective
problem
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raises?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
couldn’t
you
have
intervened
in
the
action
by
the
state
against
the
attorney
general
when
the
state
was
challenging
the
attorney
general’s
rather
amorphous
reaction
to
its
districting
plan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
let
you
pursue
that
after
lunch,
mr.
lewin.
mr.
lewin
you
may
resume
your
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lewin
would
this
have
any
unfortunate
mark
tendency
to
cut
against
the
whole
efforts
to
have
an
integrated
society?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
does
more
than
that.
it
urges,
it
presses
people
to
move
into
blacks
where
they
have
other
chicanos
or
other
porto
ricans
or
other
negroes
or
any
other
minority
group
or
a
group
that
regards
itself
as
a
minority
group.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pollak.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
that
require
an
assumption
that
that
is
the
way
it
was
constructed
in
the
first
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
their
claim
is
that
you
cannot
cut
them
up
for
a
non
neutral
purpose.
that
is
their
claim.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
understand
that,
you
wish
it
were
this
claim
that
it
sounds
like
his
claim.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
why
would
they
single
out
just
one
county
if
you
are
going
at
it,
why
not
the
whole
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
county
by
county
but
as
components
of
what,
of
the
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
for
the
period
on
the
basis
of
this
record
without
calling
any
legislators,
that
that
was
the
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pollak
you
are
now
on
the
solicitor
general’s
time.
acquiescence
that’s
up
to
him.
we
see
no
signs
of
acquiescence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
was
districting
done
before
all
these
problems
rose,
let
us
say,
100
or
150
years
ago?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
what
guidelines,
geographical
largely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
certainly
shows
that
they
were
often
political.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
assume
that
state
of
new
york
was
preceding
on
this
erroneous
assumption
as
you
described
it,
what
does
that
do
to
the
case,
basic
issues
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
could
they
do
it
for
the
reason
that
this
assistant
staff
member
thought
it
was…
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
zuckerman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
to
further
mr.
lewin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-104,
united
jewish
organizations
williamsburg
against
kerry,
the
governor
of
new
york
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
