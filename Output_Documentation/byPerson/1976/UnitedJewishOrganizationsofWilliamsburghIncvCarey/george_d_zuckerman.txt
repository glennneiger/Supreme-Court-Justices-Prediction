mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
state
of
new
york
utilized
racial
statistics
enjoying
the
1974
redistricting
plan
that
is
challenged
by
petitioners,
but
it
is
also
clear
that
the
use
of
racial
consideration,
so
the
preparation
of
1974
plan
was
not
for
any
invidious
discriminatory
purpose,
but
was
designed
as
a
remedial
measure
to
overcome
the
objections
that
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
had
raised
in
refusing
to
approve
new
york’s
1972
reapportionment
statute
with
respect
to
new
york
and
kings
county.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
not
anything
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
any
fair
response
or
reasonable
in
terms
of
proportionality,
but
if
you
reach
gomillion
situation
then
i
think
it
could
be
fairly
attacked.
the
state
of
new
york
does
not
agree
with
the
april
1,
1974
determination
of
the
department
of
justice
which
we
rejected
new
york’s
1972
lines,
and
indeed
the
state
believes
that
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
beer
versus
the
united
states
clearly
indicates
that
that
determination
of
the
department
of
justice
was
based
on
an
erroneous
application
of
the
voting
rights
act.
however,
the
fact
remains
that
due
to
the
pressures
of
time
brought
on
by
the
imminence
of
the
1974
primary,
the
state
chose
not
to
challenge
the
justice
department’s
determination.
as
such
the
state
was
required
to
enact
new
legislation
immediately
to
satisfy
the
objections
of
the
department
of
justice.
now,
in
attempting
to
satisfy
these
objections,
it
maybe
remembered
that
the
department
of
justice
had
complained
that
the
1972
districts
contained
an
over
concentration
of
nonwhites
in
the
18th
senate
district
and
in
the
53rd
to
56th
assembly
districts.
so
to
overcome
these
objections
it
was
obviously
necessary
for
the
state
to
consider
the
racial
composition
of
individual
city
blocks
to
transfer
nonwhite
voters
from
these
allegedly
over
concentrated
districts
into
the
adjoining
districts
of
allegedly
under
concentrated
minority
voters.
while
racial
considerations
are
generally
constitutionally
suspect,
where
such
considerations
have
been
taken
in
support
of
the
remedial
measure
to
further
integration
as
was
done
in
this
case,
the
use
of
racial
consideration
has
been
sustained.
we
point
out
at
pages
19
and
20
of
our
brief,
many
of
the
cases
in
which
the
conscious
use
of
racial
considerations
by
public
officials
has
been
sustained
when
taken
through
further
integration
in
the
areas
of
education
and
employments
and
in
promoting
integrated
housing.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
in
swann
versus
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
right.
mr.
justice
white
i
would
say
in
candor
there
has
been
no
holding
of
this
what
i
am
aware
of…
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
possibly,
there
have
been
--
so
we
are
citing
in
our
brief
some
lower
federal
cases,
in
which
the
makowski(ph)
case
for
one
and…
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
i
would
specifically
answer
this
question
as
to
where
there
has
been
no
finding
of
past
discrimination.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
well,
in
beer
the
holding
that
was
in
beer
would
be
inapposite
to
such
a…
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
but
because
they
say
that
where
a
redistricting
plan
constitutes
an
improvement
over
the
prior
lines,
this
would
not
be
a
violation
of
voting
rights
act,
and
we
believe
under
the
facts
of
the
new
york
situation,
the
1972
lines
which
were
rejected
by
the
department
of
justice
were
definitely
an
improvement
over
the
prior
district
lines
that
had
been
drawn
in
1966.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
george
d.
zuckerman
yes,
in
those
circumstances.
we
further
submit
that
it
is
unrealistic
to
condemn
a
reapportionment
plan
solely
on
the
ground
that
it
employed
racial
considerations,
where
such
considerations
were
utilized
to
produce
a
racially
fair
result.
here,
we
believe
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
gaffney
versus
cummings
is
instructive
just
as
politically
mindless
redistricting
might
produce
a
gerrymanded
result,
we
believe
that
a
completely
colorblind
approach
to
redistricting
might
also
produce
an
unintended
discriminatory
result.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
have
included
maps
of
the
black
and
puerto
rican
population
in
kings
counties
and
it
will
be
noted
that
the
black
population
is
concentrated
in
the
interior
of
kings
county
and
to
a
lesser
extent
so
as
the
puerto
rican
population.
the
southern
half
of
kings
county
is
almost
completely
barren
of
blacks
and
puerto
ricans.
therefore,
it
would
be
possible
applying
a
colorblind
approach
to
draw
equal
districts
starting
at
the
peripheries
of
the
county
and
working
towards
the
center
which
would
produce
a
result
in
which
minorities
would
have
far
fewer
districts
than
there
are
population
would
have
appeared
to
entitle
them
too.
we
submit
that
in
attempt
to
prevent
this
unintended
discriminatory
effect
the
state
may
consider
racial
considerations.
now,
we
believe
the
basic
flaw
in
the
petitioners’
approach
is
that
they
can
point
to
no
injury
of
constitutional
dimension.
while
we
can
appreciate
their
desire
as
a
closely
knit
religious
group
to
be
confined
within
a
single
assembly
or
senate
district,
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
ethnic
or
religious
groups
to
be
included
within
an
electoral
district
that
is
favorable
to
the
injuries
of
their
group.
obviously
in
kings
county
with
all
the
many
multiethnic
and
racial
and
religious
groups
it
would
be
impossible
to
satisfy
all
their
demands
and
still
to
draw
districts
that
were
of
equal
population
to
satisfy
the
one
person,
one
vote
constitutional
requirement.
finally,
even
as
white
voters,
we
believe
they
have
failed
to
show
any
constitutional
injury.
since
whites
with
approximately
65%
of
the
population
in
kings
county
are
in
a
majority
in
68.6%
of
the
assembly
districts
and
70%
of
the
senate
districts.
