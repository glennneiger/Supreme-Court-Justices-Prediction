justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lewin
did
someone
certainly
misrecord
who
it
was
that
told
the
draughtsman
of
the
74
apportionment
that
they
should
have
65%
nonwhite.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
other
word,
the
choice
of
the
65,
the
suggestion
of
his
testimony
is
was
that
really
compelled
by
suggestions
from
the
justice
department.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lewin
do
you
think
the
quota
is
in
every
sense
mean
improper
in
reapportionment
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
what
you
just
said,
i
gather
you
are
suggesting
there
might
be
appropriate
justifications,
but
that
at
least
the
burden
would
be
upon
the
user
of
the
quota
to
justify
its
uses,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
that
mr.
lewin,
i
take
to
level
four
but
anyway.
if
we
do
not
agree
with
you
on
your…
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suggest
that
perhaps
in
some
cases
it
is
appropriate,
if
justified.
i
gather
you
are
(inaudible)
my
position
is
but
no
one
is,
neither
state
nor
the
attorney
general
has
attempted
to
justify
what
was
done
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
argument
is
at
least
made
that
we
did
this
to
try
to
comply
with
section
5.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn’t
that
the
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
new
york
had
litigated
and
the
effect
of
the
court
judgment
was
that
either
draw
these
districts
this
way
or
you
would
have
violated
section
5,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
here,
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
the
constitution
then
required
only
section
5.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
section
5
as
construed
in
the
play
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lewin,
do
you
think
the
last
term’s
decision
on
washington
and
davis
has
any
relevancy
to
the
issue
here,
purpose
and
the
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
just
interested
in
whether
you
think
it
has
any
relevance
to
the
issue
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
lewin
is
it
that
clear
in
this
case
that
what
was
done
was
a
purposeful
racial
slur?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
washington
and
davis
gave
us
if
that
principle
is
applicable
required
not
really
affect
but
also
purpose
to
deny.
are
you
spelling
purpose
out
of
affect
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
do,
i
thought
mr.
lewin
told
us
he
was
not
arguing
this
case
on
any
basis
that
this
is
a
civic
community
but
rather
that
this
was
a
discrimination
against
whites
as
whites.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alternative!
well,
i
thought
it
was
the
basic
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
new
york
legislature
did
accepting
your
submission
in
that
respect;
raise
any
diaphanous
types
of
problems?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
what
the
problem
is.
i
know
the
answer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general
i
wonder,
are
you
saying
to
us
that
constitutional
proportionality
so
long
as
that
is
legitimately
and
honestly
the
reason
for
doing
what
was
done
with
these
districts
in
brooklyn
is
appropriate,
but
if
what
was
done,
was
done
to
fence
out
the
white
community
then
it
would
be
inappropriate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
who
will
stand
for
the
purpose
of
giving
a
fair
representation
to
the
black
community,
even
though
it
has
the
effect
of
diluting
the
representation
of
the
white
community.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
accepting
all
that,
my
question
is,
does
this
record
really
tell
us
why
this
was
done?
