justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lewin,
i
ask
you
a
question
that
you
may
also
want
to
think
about
over
the
lunch
hour.
i
wonder
if
the
existence
of
section
5
has
anything
at
all
really
changes
the
issue
at
all.
the
question
i
have
asked
is,
supposing
the
new
york
legislature,
independently
of
section
5,
had
concluded
that
there
was
undue
concentration
of
voters
of
one
particular
race
in
an
area,
could
they
for
their
own,
just
to
correct
that
situation,
had
done
what
they
say
they
are
more
or
less
compelled
to
do
by
the
united
states
here,
and
would
that
be
a
different
case
than
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lewin,
would
it
be
a
valid
objection
to
a
reapportionment
scheme
for
a
legislator
to
be
concerned
that
a
new
line
would
split
the
clients
you
represented
into
two
different
grups?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
they
should
seek
to
preserve
existing
groups
that
presumably
voters
are
black
but
they
should
not
create
any
new
of
blacks,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
are
not
assumed
the
voters
are
blacks
what
is
the
interest
in
trying
to
preserve
them
cohesively?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
taking
it
one
step
further,
if
you
started
with
your
group
being
broken
in
the
two
districts,
could
the
legislature
permissibly
decide
for
the
reasons
you
have
just
stated
would
like
to
put
this
entire
group
in
one
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
this
made
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
what
do
you
think
the
issue
is?
the
constitutional
issues
in
the
case
would
be
any
different
if
there
had
been
no
voting
rights
problem
at
all,
but
these
decisions
had
all
been
made
independently
by
the
new
york
legislature
just
to
correct
what
it
conceived
to
be
an
improper
set
of
district
lines?
