mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
been
liking
in
the
brief
time
available
to
concentrate
upon
the
merits
of
petitioners’
claim
and
leave
the
question
of
attorney
general’s
position
as
a
party
in
this
case
to
our
brief.
i
think
the
question
of
the
claim
under
the
voting
rights
act
which
is
made
and
the
compliant
is
also
taking
care
of
the
brief,
has
not
been
pretty
clarified
that
there
is
no
claim
made
--
that
there
is
discrimination
against
the
hasidism
as
such.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
government’s
interest
become
then
mr.
justice
rehnquist
preserving
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
from
a
ruling
which
i
think
would
effectively
destroy
its
application
to
apportionment.
the
case
turns
upon
the
petitioners’
claim
as
members
of
the
white
race,
and
i
think
i
can
show
rather
quickly
that
analysis
demonstrates
that
they
have
no
valid
claim
of
unconstitutional
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
that.
for
purposes
of
clarity,
i
would
like
to
discuss
first
the
general
constitutional
issue,
and
second
i
will
examine
the
question
of
whether
the
attorney
general’s
involvement,
in
the
facts,
in
the
redistricting
process,
alters
that
conclusion
in
any
way.
our
petitioners’
central
contention
appears
to
be
that
redistricting
may
not
be
done,
so
as
to
produce
any
particular
racial
composition
in
the
voting
district,
and
i
think
acceptance
of
that
contention
would
have
two
results,
each
of
which
is
completely
foreclosed
by
constitutional
law.
the
first
would
be
the
effective
destruction
of
the
application
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
to
reapportionments.
the
second
which
seems
to
me
equally
bizarre,
would
be
that
districting
itself
would
be
made
unconstitutional,
unless
done
by
a
person
who
could
be
proved
to
have
no
idea
of
the
ethnic
or
racial
composition
of
the
community
it
was
dealing
with
or
preferably
done
by
a
computer
which
was
not
programmed
to
have
any
such
information.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
was
done
by
legislatures.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
the
guidelines
which
history
shows
were
racial,
political,
geographical,
reservation
of
communities,
all
the
shows…
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
is
true
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that
is
why
i
say
that
acceptance
of
their
argument
i
think
--
for
the
reason
i
say
is,
you
cannot
do
redistricting
without
having
racial
considerations
in
mind,
unless
you
are
willing
to
forget
about
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
it
is
impossible
to
be
sure
that
there
is
not
effect
of
abridging
anybody’s
voting
right
on
account
of
his
race,
of
a
racial
group
there
has
not
been
retrogression,
unless
the
persons
who
draw
the
district
lines
knows
the
impact,
they
are
having
upon
a
racial
group.
now,
there
has
been
great
play
here
upon
the
word
‘quotas’.
it
is
a
word
i
do
not
greatly
care
for
in
most
contexts,
but
it
must
be
said
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
implemented
by
the
voting
rights
act,
and
under
either
the
majority
or
the
minority
position
in
beer,
somebody
has
to
decide
whether
a
racial
group
has
been
dropped
below
a
certain
position
in
a
voting
district.
now,
mr.
lewin
can
call
it
a
quota
if
he
wants
to
and
get
whatever
emotional
connotations
that
are
in
that
word,
but
that
happens
to
be
the
result
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
it
worked
out
to
date.
thus,
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioners’
claim
is
necessarily
that
the
voting
rights
act
itself
is
unconstitutional
and
that
claim
has
been
decisively
rejected
by
this
court,
beginning
with
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
let
me
say
one
other
thing,
the
petitioners
i
think
have
confused
here.
the
1972
plan
devised
by
the
state
of
new
york
served
many
purposes.
the
redistricting,
as
it
always
does,
served
many
purposes.
it
was
revised
after
the
attorney
general
objected
in
one
area
to
its
racial
impact,
and
only
the
revision
had
a
racial
purpose
to
it,
but
other
purposes
were
continued
to
be
served
by
the
redistricting,
so
it
is
not
true
that
this
is
a
districting
which
is
entirely
racial
in
any
way.
if
we
are
going
to
litigate
every
modification
of
the
plan
made
under
by
legislature,
it
will
be
endless,
but
petitioners’
argument
is
worse
than
destroying
the
voting
rights
act,
i
think.
they
really
think
that
any
redistricting
of
new
york
by
its
legislature
would
be
unconstitutional,
for
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
politicians
are
aware
of
the
racial
and
ethnic
makeup
of
neighborhoods,
not
only
of
their
own
constituencies,
but
of
other
constituencies,
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
how
the
lines
are
drawn
is
going
to
affect
the
outcome
of
elections.
to
tell
a
politician
who
knows
that
that
he
must
not
think
about
it.
it
is
about
as
telling
a
lawyer
he
must
not
think
about
which
argument
he
is
likely
to
declare
on
the
court
when
he
has
a
case
to
try.
it
is
about
as
effective
of
telling
somebody
for
the
next
three
seconds
he
must
not
think
about
the
word
hippopotamus.
i
waited
three
seconds.
that
means,
the
petitioners’
constitutional
theory
cannot
be
carried
out
unless
the
function
of
redistricting
has
taken
away
from
legislatures
all
together,
and
can
sign
the
courts
or
the
computers,
which
is
not
what
the
constitution
requires.
the
gaffney
against
cummings
says,
the
apportionment
task
dealing
as
it
must,
with
fundamental
choices
about
the
nature
of
representation
is
primarily
a
political
and
legislative
process.
i
think
those
two
points,
the
petitioners’
arguments
requires
both
the
unconstitutionality,
the
voting
rights
act
as
applied
to
apportionment
and
the
unconstitutionality
of
districting
done
by
legislatures
are
enough
to
dispose
off
this
case,
but
i
want
to
deal
with
a
suggestion
made,
that
somehow
this
case
does
not
involve
such
a
result,
because
it
is
unique
and
it
is
unique
because
the
attorney
general
is
involved
in
the
case,
in
the
process.
that
factor
does
not
already
analysis
one
with.
i
will
put
petitioners’
basic
contention
on
this
court
as
strongly
as
i
can,
in
order
to
show
that
there
is
nothing
to
it.
the
argument
runs
that
the
attorney
general
disapproved
of
the
1972
plan
and
in
the
process
of
discussion
with
members
of
the
department
afterwards,
the
staff
assistant
from
new
york
got
the
idea,
he
was
not
told,
he
got
the
idea
indirectly
that
it
has
come
up
with
a
65%
minimum
proportion
of
nonwhites
in
order
to
get
the
approval.
now,
it
is
said
also
that
the
attorney
general’s
refusal
to
approve
the
1972
plan
was
subsequently
shown
to
be
wrong
by
this
court’s
beer
decision,
because
proportional
representation
is
not
required
for
the
act
and
the
state
was
thus
forced
into
a
position
of
redistricting
in
a
way
it
would
not
otherwise
have
chosen.
that
as
i
said,
requires
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
it
does
not
--
like
there
are
two
answers
to
that
argument.
the
first
and
less
important
perhaps,
is
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
and
did
not
compel
the
1974
plan.
he
did
not
require
it,
new
york
could
have
tried
to
convince
him
that
the
proper
test
was
whether
the
1972
plan
was
a
(inaudible)
or
retrogressive.
they
did
not
try
to
convince
of
that,
they
did
not
present
him
with
evidence
from
which
he
could
have
made
that
determination.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
whatsoever
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
this
case
has
to
be
analyzed
just
as
if
the
state
of
new
york
could
have
chosen
to
do
this
on
their
own,
and
this
for
that
reason
--
wait
a
minute,
let
me
read
my
second
reason.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
indeed,
i
am
willing
to
except
for
the
purposes
of
answering
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
and
answering
mr.
lewin’s
contentions,
i
am
willing
to
except
the
hypothesis
which
is
contrary
to
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
told
them
he
would
only
approve
a
65%
plan.
i
will
accept
that
for
purposes
of
argument,
i
think
it
makes
no
difference.
i
say
that
for
this
reason.
there
was
nothing
whatsoever
improper
about
the
attorney
general’s
involvement
in
this
process.
there
are
some
overtones
of
that
in
this
argument.
the
fact
is
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
permanently
shifted
federal
state
balance
in
this
particular
area,
and
the
voting
rights
act,
which
implements
fifteenth
amendment,
puts
the
attorney
general
into
the
redistricting
process,
when
a
covered
jurisdiction
comes
to
him
rather
than
going
to
court.
in
that
sense,
in
that
constitutional
sense,
the
attorney
general
is
as
much
a
part
of
this
process
with
a
different
role
to
play,
but
a
part
of
this
process
legitimately
as
he
is
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york,
as
he
is
the
governor
of
new
york
or
anybody
else
who
plays
a
part
in
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
but
i
suppose
you
come
to
the
same
conclusion
realistically
by
sitting
there
rejecting
plans
forever
until
they
come
to
the
one
he
wants,
but
he
does
not
do
that.
his
only
function
under
the
statute…
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
state
can
go
to
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
litigate,
they
do
not
have
to
come
to
the
attorney
general
at
all,
and
if
they
do
go
to
the
court,
a
prior
adverse
decision
by
the
attorney
general
is
entitled
to
no
legal
weight
in
that
proceeding.
but
the
fact
what
he
did
here,
was
his
legitimate
role
and
a
role
given
to
him
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
by
the
voting
rights
act.
so
that
what
petitioners
are
doing,
is
bringing
back
in
a
kind
of
sky’s
form,
the
federalism
objection
that
was
made
to
the
voting
rights
act
and
decisively
rejected
in
south
carolina
against
katzenbach.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
takes
the
position
mr.
justice
white
which
was
upheld
by
this
court
that
he
has
to
be
persuaded,
he
has
to
be
--
the
state
must
carry
the
burden
of
proof
with
him,
that
there
is
no
denial
or
abridgment
just
as
it
must
be
for
the
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
whether
there
is
black
racial
voting,
it
is
one
of
the
questions
that
he
addresses
himself
to
when
he
asked
them
to
tell
him
about
it.
of
course,
if
there
is
no
black
racial
voting
or
very
little,
the
problem
becomes
much
less.
but
the
other
part
of
this
matter
is;
it
is
suggested
that
the
attorney
general
made
a
mistake
when
he
refused
to
approve
the
1972
plan,
because
he
was
using
the
theory
that
the
minority
of
this
court
took
in
beer,
and
he
should
have
been
taking
the
position
that
the
majority
took.
of
course,
this
was
before
beer
was
decided
and
the
attorney
general
was
acting
in
the
light
of
the
lower
court’s
decision
to
appear.
but
the
attorney
general
must
often
decide
before
an
issue
is
clarified
by
law
and
is
no
different
than
if
new
york
had
gone
to
the
three-judge
court
and
got
an
erroneous
decision,
which
he
did
not
appeal
or
if
the
legislature
had
made
a
mistake
of
law
and
put
in
a
plan
that
did
not
have
to
under
the
voting
rights
act.
it
is
no
different
then
if
the
governor
with
a
mistaken
view
of
what
this
court
would
ultimately
say
about
the
voting
rights
act
had
kept
vetoing
legislation
by
the
legislature,
until
he
forced
them
to
the
1974
plan
or
some
analogous
plan.
so,
that
in
all
of
these
cases
the
issue
is
not
whether
somebody
who
is
legitimately
in
the
process
as
the
attorney
general
most
certainly
was,
may
have
made
a
miscalculation
about
the
future
course
of
the
law.
the
question
in
all
of
these
hypothesize
cases,
as
on
in
this
case
is,
whether
the
resulting
redistricting
violated
the
constitutional
right
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
must
be
analyzed
just
as
if
there
were
no
voting
rights
act
and
just
as
if
there
were
no
attorney
general.
that
means
it
comes
down
to
the
question
of
whether
a
state
or
local
government
can
take
race
into
account
and
choose
to
redistrict,
so
that
there
is
racial
proportional
representation
from
an
area.
that
maybe
a
good
idea
or
it
maybe
a
bad
idea,
but
i
think
that’s
a
legislative
question,
because
i
don’t
think
there
is
a
slightest
doubt
that
as
a
constitutional
matter,
a
state
can
do
that.
i
do
not
really
think
there
is
a
slightest
doubt
that
that
is
effectively
what
gaffney
against
cummings
has
held.
i
do
not
think
it
is
distinguishable.
i
was
quite
surprised.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
there
certainly
is
a
limit.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
was
speaking
mr.
justice
stewart
of
a
taking
race
into
account
in
order
to
achieve
a
rough
proportionality.
i
was
not
speaking
of
a
case
in
which
you
are
just
staking
a
race
and
fencing
it
out
as
it
was
true
in
gomillion
against
lightfoot.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
i
meant
to
talk
about
dealing
race
as
party
it
was
in
gaffney
against
cummings.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
a
state
i
think
could
say
that
because
race
is
a
political
issue
and
because
groups
in
its
area
do
vote
somewhere
along
racial
lines,
that
is
going
to
construct
districts,
which
are
otherwise
reasonably
compact
or
contagious
and
so
forth
as
these
districts
are
here,
which
give
a
chance
for
something
like
proportional
representation
of
the
group
in
the
legislature.
i
was
astounded
when
mr.
lewin
said
that
race
is
not
a
part
of
our
political
process.
race
has
been
‘the
political
issue’
in
this
nation
since
it
was
founded.
we
may
regret
that
that
is
a
political
reality,
but
it
is
a
reality,
that
is
what
the
fifteenth
amendment
--
what
civil
war
was
about,
fifteenth
amendment
is
about
what
the
constitution
was
in
part
about
and
it
is
a
subject
we
struggle
with
politically
today
and
i
think
the
suggestion
that
we
ignore
race
in
order
to
discourage
block
voting
is
really
suggestion
that
we
allow
the
dilution
of
minority
votes,
the
abridgement
of
minority
votes
so
that
they
will
not
be
encouraged
to
vote
together.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
if
what
was
done
was
done
with
the
intention
of
harming
the
white
community
politically
--
of
course
it
is
true
and…
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
i
think
the
white
community
mr.
justice
brennan
cannot
have
a
claim
to
more,
the
constitutional
claim
to
more
voting
representative
strength
than
it
has
voting
strength
in
the
population.
furthermore,
throughout
our
history
people
have
recognized
the
economic
interest,
ethnic
interest,
religious
interest,
all
kinds
of
interests
in
redistricting.
it
is
very
strange,
if
blacks
were
the
only
groups
that
could
be
recognized.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
tells
us
that
the
attorney
general
objected
because
he
thought
there
was
dilution.
it
tells
us
that
new
york
state
got
the
impression
that
they
ought
to
get
a
65%,
by
the
way
it’s
63%,
attorney
general
thought
unless
you
include
chinese,
and
apparently
that
is
as
much
as
we
know,
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
constitutional
claim
and
for
that
reason
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
