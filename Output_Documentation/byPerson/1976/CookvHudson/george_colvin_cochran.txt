mr.
george
colvin
cochran
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
10
minutes
please
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
my
name
is
george
cochran,
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
i
have
with
me,
mr.
john
b.
freese(ph)
an
attorney
from
ashland
mississippi
who
handled
the
case
to
the
northern
district
from
mississippi
in
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals.
primarily,
due
to
mr.
freese's
efforts
in
this
case,
you
know,
i
have
the
record
as
it
is
presented
in
the
court,
which
i
will
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
on
this
morning.
this
case
of
course
arises
out
of
calhoun
county
mississippi.
it
would
occur
in
calhoun
county
as
a
public
school
board
there
made
the
decision
not
to
re-hire
the
petitioners
in
this
case
for
the
sole
reason
that
they
sent
their
children
to
a
private
segregated
academy,
also
located
in
calhoun
county.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
the
petitioners
were
nothing
other
than
competent
and
respected
by
the
students,
fellow
faculty
members
and
the
administration.
specifically
the
only
reason
they
were
terminated
was
due
to
their
decision
to
exercise
what
this
court
is
deemed
to
be
a
fundamental
right
in
runyon
to
send
their
children
to
a
private
segregated
academy.
now,
there
are
significant
problems
with
the
case
as
it
now
comes
before
you.
one
problem,
i
think
is
a
policy
as
stipulated.
to
understand
what
happened
in
calhoun
county,
i
think
one
has
to
understand
the
policy
under
which
the
school
board
was
operating.
on
page
9
of
the
record,
there
is
a
stipulation
made
by
mr.
freese(ph)
in
cooperation
with
counsel
for
the
opposing
for
the
school
board.
that
this
policy
as
applied
was
limited
to
teachers
teaching
in
calhoun
county
and
living
within
the
county
and
if
they
met
these
two
pre-requisites
and
they
had
to
send
their
children
to
the
public
schools
of
that
county.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
is
what
i
am
getting
to
now.
the
policy
as
i
brought
to
the
court’s
attention
in
my
brief
on
the
merits
is
altered
from
what
i
had
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
have
cited
the
court
to
page
298
of
the
record,
which
is
the
answer,
filed
by
the
respondents
in
the
case
as
it
begins.
the
answers
filed
by
respondents
indicate
this
policy
has
two
problems.
the
first
is
if
you
are
living
in
the
county,
then,
and
teaching
in
the
public
schools,
then
you
must
send
your
children
to
the
public
schools
of
calhoun
county.
if
you
are
living
outside
the
county,
then
you
must
send
your
children
to
“public
schools”
not
necessary
the
schools
in
calhoun
county.
on
page
32
of
the
record
--
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
in
calhoun
county,
there
would
be
that
problem,
yes,
yes.
on
page
32
of
the
record,
counsel
for
respondent
refers
to
the
policy
as
stipulated
and
alters
it
somewhat.
this
time,
the
policy
is
described
to
me
that
if
you
teach
in
the
public
schools
of
calhoun
county
then
you
have
to
send
your
children
to
“public
schools.”
so,
we
have
a
difference
in
the
record
as
to
what
teachers
had
to
do
to
comply,
that
is
why
they
send
the
children
to
public
schools
of
calhoun
county
or
to
the
public
schools
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
this
is
kind
of
firmed
up
on
page
134
and
135,
the
final
records
in
the
record
to
it.
mr.
freese
is
examining
an
expert
witness
and
he
refers
to
the
policy
as
applying
to
teachers
having
to
send
their
children
to
the
public
schools
in
the
county.
there
is
an
objection
made
by
opposing
counsel
and
the
question
is
rephrased
in
the
context
of
sending
children
to
public
schools.
i
choose
to
say
that
the
policy
has
two
separate
facets
to
it.
one;
sending
your
children
to
public
schools
at
calhoun
county,
and
two,
sending
your
children
to
“public
schools”
and
this
dovetails
have
been
quite
nicely
with
what
you
have
in
the
record
with
respect
to
teachers
who
were
threatened
not
to
be
re-hired
because
they
sent
their
children
to
schools
that
might
not
have
been
public.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
the
court
of
appeals
adopted
judge
katie’s
finding
with
respect
to
policy
and
that
was
in
essence
that
if
you
taught
at
the
public
schools
of
calhoun
county,
you
have
to
send
your
children
to
the
public
schools
of
that
county.
but
it
does
not
match
with
the
record
because
we
have
the
innex
(ph)
who
were
black
teachers
in
hamlin,
a
white
teacher
sending
their
children
to
school
outside
of
calhoun
county
and
checks
are
made
as
to
whether
or
not
these
schools
are
public
or
private.
the
indication
is,
there
would
have
not
been
re-hired.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
on
page
509
of
tanker,
the
court
very
clearly
says
it
will
make
an
independent
review
of
the
record,
when
first
amendment
questions
are
an
issue
and
in
tanker,
you
did
make
an
independent
review,
it
all
goes
to
the
point
of
saying
the
district
court
said
that
we
would
not
review
it?
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
i
think
it
is
critical
in
deciding
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case.
and
it
is
part
of
constitutional
facts
as
to
—
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
i
am
pointing
to
with
this
fact
is
that,
in
order
to
understand
the
purpose
and
the
thrust
behind
what
the
public
school
board
in
calhoun
county
was
doing,
i
think
these
facts
are
critical
because
we
have
a
very
articulately
drawn
policy
and
you
have
to
focus
in
on
the
thing
to
understand
exactly
what
is
going
on
the
county.
that
is
the
only
point
i
am
trying
to
make
and
the
other
point
is
that
if
you
do
not
construe
the
policy
differently,
then
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
united
states
district
court
then
you
can
not
deal
with
these
other
teachers
whose
re-employment
was
threatened
because
they
sent
their
children
to,
let
us
say
schools
in
atlanta
or
jackson
mississippi.
that
is
the
only
point
i
am
trying
to
make.
i
really
do
not
think
it
is
critical
except
there
is
a
problem
with
the
record
on
the
basis
of
exactly,
how
this
is
policy
operated.
i
believe
that
if
you
look
at
the
record,
you
can
ascertain
that
fairly
that
the
policy
has
three
purposes.
the
purpose
has
been
dealt
with
by
the
courts
below,
of
course,
has
been
compliance
with
the
segregation
order
entered
by
judge
katie
in
1968.
taking
positive
and
affirmative
steps
to
implement
a
unitary
school
system.
i
will
talk
about
that
purpose
later
on.
i
think
there
are
also
two
other
purposes
that
are
clear
from
the
record.
one
is,
ensuring
dedication
by
public
school
teachers
to
the
public
schools
and
this
is
clearly
all
the
expert
testimony
in
this
case
indicates
that
one
of
the
primary
thrust
to
the
policy
was
to
ensure
the
loyalty
on
the
part
of
the
teachers.
the
theory
being,
if
you
do
not
send
your
children
to
the
public
schools
and
you
will
not
be
loyal
to
the
schools
in
what
you
are
teaching.
the
record
also
bares
out
that
this
aspect
of
the
policy,
that
is
ensuring
dedication
was
carried
out
in
fact,
by
the
persons
responsible
for
it.
mr.
hudson,
the
school
principal.
there
are
two
parts
of
the
record
in
which
indicate
or
highlight
instances
of
how
the
policy
was
implemented.
you
have
the
innex
(ph)
who
are
black
teachers
teaching
in
the
calhoun
city
school
system.
they
sent
their
children
to
a
school
in
atlanta
and
they
were
threatened
with
termination
until
it
was
found
that
these
were
indeed
public
schools.
same
thing
with
hamlin
who
sent
his
children
to
the
magnolia
school
for
the
deaf
and
again
his
–
being
plump
was
threat
at
that
time.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
mr.
chief
justice
that
would
be
if
the
mississippi
state
legislature
passed
a
statute
which
in
essence
decreed
that
public
schools
could
mandate
the
teachers
teaching
there
had
to
send
their
children
to
the
public
schools.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
must.
clearly,
there
would
be
first
amendment
problems
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters
and
a
serious
encroachment
on
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
for
the
teachers.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
but
still
the
difference
between
sporadic
and
policy
by
the
state
legislature,
still
you
have
first
amendment
problems
of
the
teachers
involved.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
you
mean
as
to
the
empirical
basis
--
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
if
it
is
ad
hoc
decision
rather
than
the
historical
data
gathering
which
you
had
at
michelle,
you
have
the
same
problems
because
you
are
imprinting
person’s
rights
without
a
serious
record
finding.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
the
mere
fact
that
the
teachers
are
exercising
their
fundamental
right
to
send
their
children
to
a
private
sector.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
you
can
read
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters
to
be
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
there
was
a
military
school
also
involved
in
pierce,
but
runyun
last
term
you
all
reaffirmed
in
no
uncertain
terms.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
yes,
the
court
reaffirmed.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
yes
sir,
a
military
school.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
i
believe
substantive
due
process
case
but
in
runyan,
you
utilized
that
case
to
bolster
the
finding
in
runyan
that
you
have
a
fundamental
right
to
send
your
child
to
a
private
school.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
the
court
dealt
at
length
with
whether
or
not
it
really
was
a
first
amendment
right
in
runyan.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
the
part
resting
on
first
amendment,
free
association,
part
on
pierce
v.
society
sisters.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
both
certainly
i
do.
the
point,
i
am
trying
to
make
is
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
whatsoever,
that
these
teachers
were
exercising
a
fundamental
constitutional
right,
no
matter
how
it
is
defined.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
as
you
know,
most
of
these
cases
have
been
tried
on
the
right
to
travel
theory
and
this
court
last
term,
reaffirmed
in
a
short
procurium
that
regulations
such
that
of
constitutional
but
did
not
point
up
to
any
fundamental
constitutional
right
as
being
encroached
by
these
regulations
that
require
you
to
live
in
the
area
where
you
teach
or
work.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
kelly
is
one
but
mccarthy.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
kelly
certainly
does
not
hurt
simply
because,
if
we
are
going
into
kelly,
then
herlink
(ph)
was
not
determined
to
be
a
fundamental
right
in
kelly.
if
you
are
going
into
mccarthy
v.
civil
service
commission,
the
short
opinion
last
term,
there
is
nothing
in
that
opinion
which
indicates
that
the
fundamental
right
was
involved,
--
that
to
be
counter
balanced
against
the
state's
interest
in
making
you
reside
where
you
live.
all
of
those
cases
are
distinct
on
the
basis
of
no
fundamental
rights
involved.
here,
we
do
have
a
fundamental
right
being
exercised
that
is
the
right
to
send
your
child
to
a
private
segregated
academy,
under
runyan
and
pierce.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
substantive
due
process
liberty,
sir.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
yes.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
we
would
be
certainly
glad
to
take
up
at
this
point
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
is
a
new
mississippi
statute
passed
after
the
united
states
district
court
opinion,
which
in
essence
says
that
school
boards
can
no
longer
require
public
school
teachers
to
send
their
children
to
the
public
schools.
under
the
united
states
district
court
opinion,
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
mr.
justice,
i
have
a
serious
doubts,
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
constitutional.
the
united
states
district
court
says
it
is
part
of
implementing
a
court
desegregation
decree,
that
positive
and
affirmative
should
e
taken
and
one
positive
and
affirmative
step
is
you
cannot
send
your
child
to
a
private
segregate
academy.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no
but
on
page
30,
if
you
look
at
page
39a,
in
a
petition
for
certiorari,
the
last
part
of
the
opinion
written
by
judge
katie(ph),
he
refers
to
what
school
board
has
done
as
part
of
its
affirmative
duty.
the
department
of
justice
takes
the
same
position
on
page
402
and
403
of
the
record,
you
have
a
letter
from
david
norman
of
the
department
of
justice
when
he
comments
on
this
policy
and
he
indicates
that
the
department
of
justice
position
is
that
this
is
part
of
the
duty
under
a
court
desegregation
decree
to
take
positive
and
affirmative
steps.
so
therefore,
if
it
is
part
of
a
court
decree,
vis-a-vis,
implementing
unitary
school
system
then
the
statute
is
going
to
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
teachers
who
sends
their
children
to
private
segregated
schools.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
he
did
not.
the
statute
was
passed
after
judge
katie
entered
his
decree
but
this
circuit,
of
course,
did
not
take
it
up
and
footnoted
away,
there
is
no
question,
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
the
statute
is
retroactive.
we
have
an
attorney
general’s
opinion
that
indicates
it
is
not
retroactive.
again,
my
contention
would
be
that
the
school
board
at
this
point
cannot
comply
with
that
statute
simply
because
it
is
under
fifth
circuit
order,
what
they
are
doing
is
constitutional.
so
you
have
a
conflict
between
constitutional
requirements
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
state
statute.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
that’s
the
problem.
in
reading
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
is
difficult
to
really
understand
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
saying
because
you
have
a
complete
split
between
judge
coleman(ph),
judge
ronie(ph)
and
judge
clark(ph),
but
the
opinion
written
by
judge
katie
are
clear
reading
of
this
opinion
would
indicate
that
as
part
of
the
affirmative
duty
to
implement
a
unitary
school
system,
this
type
of
decree
should
and
must
be
implemented.
that
is
the
way
i
read
judge
katie’s
opinion
and
he
is
adapting
it
as
his
own.
that
opinion
says
he
starts
off
his
opinion
talking
about
his
court
order
in
1968
to
integrate
the
schools
positive
and
affirmative
steps.
the
latter
parts
of
his
opinion,
he
is
approving
this
and
making
it
part
of
the
court
order.
i
still
would
say
that
the
state
statute
is
in
constitutional
jeopardy,
when
read
in
the
context
of
lower
court
opinions.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
it
is
in
footnote
5
of
my
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
the
new
statute
--
it
would
be
found
in
the
respondent’s
brief
on
the
merits.
it
is
located
on
page
19.
well,
first,
let
me
get
back.
this
school
board
in
calhoun
county,
one
part
of
the
thrust
of
the
policy
was
to
ensure
dedication
and
loyalty
on
the
part
of
the
teachers.
this
is
completely
divorced
from
compliance
with
court
decree
to
implement
a
unitary
schools
system.
another
factor,
which
is
clear
in
the
record
that
motivated
this
decision,
is
the
private
segregated
academy
itself.
you
get
testimony
on
the
records
such
as
that
from
john
bert,
a
superintendent,
where
he
is
speaking
to
the
policy
and
speaking
in
terms
of
we
do
not
need
a
private
segregated
school
in
calhoun
county.
in
another
portion
of
the
record,
you
have
malry(ph)
who
is
a
school
board
president,
on
218,
he
is
questioned
on
direct
examination
as
to
what
influenced
him
or
the
board
in
passing
this
policy
and
he
puts
in
the
record
newspaper
clippings,
showing
fundraising
activities
on
the
part
of
the
academy.
it
is
obvious
that
the
part
of
the
influence
and
part
of
the
thrust
behind
what
the
school
board
was
doing
was
to
curtail
competition
on
the
part
of
the
private
segregation
academy,
another
aspect
of
the
policy
that
has
serious
constitutional
problems
under
pierce
v.
society
sisters.
the
last
part
of
the
policy
which
the
lower
court
has
spoken
to
is
compliance
with
the
court
order
to
integrate
the
schools.
in
looking
at
this
aspect,
i
think
it
is
a
correct
thing
to
do
to
look
at
the
history
of
what
was
going
on
in
calhoun
county
at
the
time,
this
policy
was
passed
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
or
not,
this
policy
was
really
needed
in
order
to
implement
a
unitary
school
system
under
the
court
decree.
now,
malry(ph)
the
school
board
president
testified
that
the
policy
had
been
under
consideration
for
2
or
3
years,
which
would
mean
in
essence
that
the
school
boards
are
thinking
about
this
policy
immediately
after
it
was
put
on
the
court
order.
that
is
in
the
context
of
the
united
states
district
court
judge
had
not
gone
far
enough
in
his
order,
and
that
they
should
take
independent
steps
to
--
beyond
that
which
the
united
states
district
court
ordered.
there
are
2400
students
in
the
calhoun
county
system.
at
the
time
that
the
policy
was
passed,
only
eight
teachers
were
involved
sending
their
children
to
private
segregated
schools.
the
school
were
petitioners
were.
i
will
continue
on
rebuttal,
that
is
10
minutes,
thank
you.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
a
couple
of
points.
apparently,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
others
are
referring
to
sue
city
case,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
decision
below
should
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
opinion
by
court
that
the
writs
have
been
probably
granted.
there
is
a
quantum
difference
between
sue
city
and
this
case.
this
is
not
an
isolated
instance
that
will
not
re-occur
again.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
apparently,
the
amicus
brief
by
the
national
education
association
is
now
being
accepted.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
yes,
i
do
not
think
this
court
can
really
agree
with
the
amicus
presentation
that
because
of
runyan
that
there
will
not
be
private
segregated
schools.
that,
on
itself,
on
its
face
i
think
is
highly
improbable,
but...
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
certainly
there
is,
and
there
is
also
one
of
the
most
outstanding
united
states
district
court
justice
mccathew,
judge
katie,
who
is
now
utilized
his
judicial
power
to
approve
this
type
of
regulation
of
first
amendment.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
yes,
but
that
opinion
can
and
will
be
cited
for
the
basic
proposition
as
part
of
a
court
order
desegregating
a
school
is
permissible
to
utilizing
the
judicial
power
to
curtail
the
rights
of
teachers
within
public
schools,
to
send
their
children
to
private
segregated
schools
and
you
cannot
read
that
decision
any
other
way.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
not
permissible,
the
power
is
there...
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
yes.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
no,
i
would
contend
that
now
the
school
board
order
for
the
school
board
policy
is
now
a
part
of
united
states
district
courts
decree
to
implement
a
unitary
school
system
in
calhoun
county.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
then
let
us
look
at
it
the
other
way.
take
judge
katie’s
opinion,
take
the
fifth
circuit
opinion.
these
opinions
can
and
will
be
read
by
other
school
boards
and
by
the
united
states
district
courts
that
this
type
of
action
is
permissible,
these
of
the
unitary
school
system.
it
is
not
like
rice
v.
sioux
city
where
this
barrier
will
never
reoccur
again,
whether
or
not
the
state
could
discriminate
against
aliens.
that
was
isolated
instance.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
the
decision
below?
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
well,
i
wonder
how
many
states
have
followed
it
since
then.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
since
then?
you
mean
as
to...
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
i
have
not
briefed
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
case
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
on
my
brief
on
the
merits?
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
or
now?
well,
that
would
be
going
outside
but
i
can
tell
you
that
the
mesa
(ph)
school
system
and
we
have
receive
work
indirectly
through
just
talking
--
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
i
cannot
cite
you
any
other
school
boards
doing
it,
but
i
think
if
you
--
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
but
if
you
give
me
six
months,
i
think
i
would
be
able
to
cite
you
to
the
united
states
district
court
opinions
in
corporate
in
cook
v.
hudson
decree
curtailing
the
right
of
public
school
teachers.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not
asking,
that
district
court
stop
deciding
cases,
what
we
are
here
is
to
protect
the
first
merit
rights
of
public
school
teachers,
to
let
them
through
no
impediments
whatsoever
judicial
or
otherwise?
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
citing
adler,
in
the
united
public
workers
v.
mitchell.
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
reading
judge
colman’s
opinion
and
trying
to
ask
exactly
what
he
means
other
than
that
the
exercise
of
power
by
school
boards
is
subject
to
no
judicial
review
whatsoever.
he
starts
out
his
opinion
saying
no
substantial
federal
questions
raised,
and
quite
opposite
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
that
opinion.
and
i
also
have
quite
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
this
problem
of
whether
or
not
this
case
should
be
dismissed
as
improvident
grant,
in
light
of
rice
v.
sioux
city
and
i
think
this
case
has
nationwide
importance
of
that
nation
by
itself,
and
it
is
not
moved.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
judge
katie
on
page
39a,
the
petitioner
per
se,
the
reprint
of
his
case
specifically
limits
his
decision
to
public
school
teachers
sending
their
children
to
private
segregated
academy.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
in
what
way,
mr.
justice?
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
you
are
talking
about
parents
generally
can’t
send
their
children?
well,
no,
under
runyon,
you
have
a
clear
right
as
a
parent
to
send
your
child
to
a
private
segregated
school.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
no,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
introduction
part
of
runyon
where
you
reaffirmed
the
right
but
then
you
go
on
to
the
right
of
the
school
under
1981,
not
to
admit
qualified
blacks.
but
there
is
a
difference
between
the
1981
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
school
versus
the
right
of
a
parent
to
send
his
child
to
a
private
school
to
promote
racial
segregation.
and
these
two
rights
are
separate.
you
cannot
impute
the
school's
violation
of
the
law
with
the
parent's
exercise
their
right
to
send
their
children
there.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
not
with
the
close
reading
of
runyon
and
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters,
the
constitution
pressed
a
squared
there.
it
is
just
this
problem
with
the
teachers
in
public
schools,
and
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
this
again
that
this
reliance
on
rice
v.
sioux
city.
to
me
rice
is
not
all
applicable,
that
--
frank
quitters
(ph)
opinion
in
that
case,
limits
it
to
the
fact
that
it
will
not
reoccur
again,
it
is
no
importance
because
of
the
new
statute.
this
is
not
the
case
in
cook
v.
hudson,
it
is
an
important
issue,
large
articles
written
about
it
continually,
it
is
not
moved,
it
is
a
damage
suit
back
pay.
and
this
issue
is
going
to
come
back
sooner
or
later,
and
it
is
not
an
improvident
grant
case.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
the
entire
thrust
of
this
case
is
that
absent
--
the
standards
and
the
facts
that
you
find
in
tanker
and
pickering,
substantial
disturbance
alluring
a
professional
duty
to
work
within
the
institutional
environment,
the
man
can
not
be
fired.
and
that
is
what
we
are
working
with
in
this
case
here.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
yes,
in
cook
v.
hudson,
if
you
have
a
public
school
teacher
who
is
sending
his
child
to
a
private
segregated
academy
and
you
can
show
a
linkage
between
that
act
and
alluring
of
his
professional
competence
in
the
classroom,
that
is
--
this
act
of
sending
a
child
to
a
private
segregated
academy
has
influenced
the
black
students
in
such
a
way
that
he
is
no
longer
effective
teacher,
out
he
goes.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
i
think
the
facts
are
clear,
on
page
20
--
the
only
facts
in
this
record
as
to
disturbance
on
the
school,
on
201
you
get
references
that
you
would
hear
talk.
a
hard
to
pin
down,
on
page
217,
you
would
hear
a
parent
say
that
his
kids
said
such
and
such.
on
212,
this
is
malry(ph),
the
school
board
president
talking.
on
212,
it
says
you
would
hear
teachers
talk.
this
is
on
direct
examination,
the
only
evidence
is
you
would
hear
a
talk.
mr.
freese(ph)
on
cross-examination,
you
go
to
227
and
228,
he
is
talking
to
school
board
president,
ask
the
school
board
president
on
227,
do
you
know
anybody
in
the
county?
yes
i
do.
on
228
he
says,
“then
who
are
these
people
making
complaints?”
well,
he
is
still
not
sure
and
you
read
on
you
will
finally
get
the
simpson
kids.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
of
simpson
kids’
complaint,
on
229
asks,
“do
you
know
anybody
else
that
complained?”
no,
that
is
the
only
disturbance
in
the
county.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
there
is
no
fact
in
this
record,
which
meets
tanker
and
pickering
standards.
if
you
want
to
find
where
the
commotion
comes,
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
you
look
on
page
392
of
the
record.
mr.
george
colvin
cochran
yes,
it
certainly
does
and
under
tanker,
you
have
full
power
to
review.
if
you
look
on
392,
which
is
a
school
board
attorney’s
letter
to
justice
department,
he
says
in
there
that
we
have
told
the
teachers
that
they
would
be
terminated
for
sending
their
children
to
private
segregated
schools
and
we
have
caused
quite
a
commotion
in
the
county.
i
think
the
school
board
is
a
group
that
caused
the
commotion
in
the
county,
not
teachers
sending
their
children
to
private
segregated
schools.
it
is
clear
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
to
be
reversed
on
this
case
and
it
should
not
be
dismissed
as
improvident
grant.
this
is
not
rice
v.
sioux
city.
