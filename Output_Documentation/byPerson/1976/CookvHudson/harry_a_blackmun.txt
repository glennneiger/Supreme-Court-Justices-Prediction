justice
harry
a.
blackmun
somebody
could
live
just
outside
the
county
line
and
not
be
subject
to
the
policy.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
somewhere
when
you
discussed
the
new
mississippi
legislation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
district
court
did
not
require
this
school
to
impose
such
a
condition.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
but
judge
katie
did
not
have
that
question
before
at
my
rule.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
there
any
special
school
for
handicapped
children?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
there
had
been.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many
children
have
adopted
in
calhoun,
it
must
be
200.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
this
in
your
estimation,
did
it
or
did
it
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
functioning
of
the
public
schools?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
by
sheer
numbers?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
judge
katieâ€™s
view
sustain
a
statute
or
a
state
statute
saying
that
no
parent
may
send
his
child
to
a
segregated
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
see
any
difference
in
principle?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
between
applying
the
rule
to
just
teachers
or
to
parents
generally?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
was
in
the
holding
of
the
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
answer
is
that
judge
katie
would
not,
as
you
said
in
his
opinion,
he
would
not
have
sustained
a
law
applying
to
parents
generally?
