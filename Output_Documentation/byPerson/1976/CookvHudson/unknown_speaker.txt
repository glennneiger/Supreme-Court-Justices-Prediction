unknown
speaker
very
well,
your
children
might
not
even
be
eligible
to
got
to
schools.
unknown
speaker
is
your
position,
the
same
as
that
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
but
ordinarily
if
the
district
court
makes
a
finding
and
somehow
the
court
of
appeals
upholds
it,
we
do
not
review
that
kind
of
evidentiary
point.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
those
were
historical
facts
--
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is
the
difference
between
the
sporadic
decisions
by
local
school
boards
that
declared
policy
of
the
states
by
its
legislature.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference
in
degree.
unknown
speaker
since
in
the
mitchell
case,
the
court
held
certain
first
amendment
rights
of
public
employees
could
be
limited
and
that's
been
re-affirmed
here
at
that
time.
if
just
the
particular
governmental
agency,
the
head
of
the
agency
had
made
that
decision,
ad
hoc,
a
policy
of
his
own
agency,
do
you
think
there
might
have
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
where
did
you
get
the
first
amendment
problem
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
okay,
when
you
said
fundamental
right,
you've
said
first
amendment
right.
how
do
you
spell
out
of
the
first
amendment,
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
teachers
to
send
their
kids
to
a
private
school?
unknown
speaker
here
there
are
no
religious
over
there.
unknown
speaker
this
court
reaffirmed.
unknown
speaker
the
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters
involved
also
the
hills
school
i
think.
unknown
speaker
just
a
private,
non-sectarian
school?
well
do
you
think
pierce
rested
on
entirely
on
the
first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
certainly
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
it
say?
unknown
speaker
and
you
pushed
both
of
it.
unknown
speaker
in
what
way
is
this
case
different
than
a
school
board
regulation
that
you
have
to
live
within
the
school
district
if
you
going
to
teach.
certainly,
that
could
infringe
your
right
of
association
to,
if
you
want
to
associate
with
people
in
the
next
county.
unknown
speaker
you
are
speaking
now
of
the
policeman
and
fireman’s
cases?
unknown
speaker
those
who
help
you
or
it
hurts
you?
unknown
speaker
pierce
went
off
of
liberty
didn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
just
say
liberty,
use
the
word
liberty.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
believe
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
--
the
school
board
must
have
this
policy
only
that
it
could.
that's
not
about
that,
that's
not
the
real
conflict.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
text
of
the
new
statute,
i
cannot
--
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
any
exception
or
any
question
or
hardship
or
anything
lately?
unknown
speaker
let
me
suggest
an
activity
a
little
less
than
making
the
speech
that
justice
marshall
has
suggested.
suppose
the
public
school
teacher
served
on
the
board
of
directors
or
board
of
trustees
without
pay,
so
that
there
is
no
moonlighting
problem,
served
on
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
segregated
academy.
do
you
think
that
would
be
grounds
for
termination.
unknown
speaker
well
mr.
hickman,
let
us
try
to
put
this
thing
perhaps
on
a
little
broader
context.
supposing
that
during
the
height
of
the
vietnam
war,
somebody
on
the
south
east
asia
desk
in
the
state
department
makes
a
public
statement
saying,
he
thinks
that
the
government
policy
is
in
entirely
wrong
in
south
east
asia.
do
you
think
that
the
government
would
have
a
right
to
fire
him
from
that
position?
unknown
speaker
yes,
he
is
in
the
state
department.
he
is
working
on
the
implementation
of
the
government’s
policy
presumably.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hickman,
is
a
policy
involved
in
this
case
unique
to
calhoun
county
in
mississippi?
the
only
county
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
this
policy
caused
a
legislature
in
1974
in
mississippi
to
adapt
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
how
important
is
this
case
then,
generally?
unknown
speaker
i
said
that,
does
this
case
have
any
importance
then
beyond
the
individual
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
they
are
claiming
damages.
unknown
speaker
there
are
perhaps
other
counties
and
cities
in
the
state
of
mississippi
that
are
subject
to
desegregation
decrees.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hickman,
i
couldn’t
hear
the
justice’s
question.
was
it
directed
to
the
‘74
legislation?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
involved
repetition,
would
you
state
for
me
what
comment
you
have
upon
the
effect
of
the
new
legislation
on
this
case.
unknown
speaker
you
saying
that
because
of
the
passage
of
the
new
legislation,
this
case
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
an
argument?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
suggest
in
your
proposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
you
agree,
the
case
is
not
moved?
unknown
speaker
would
you
hire
those
teachers?
unknown
speaker
but
you
admit
it
is
moved?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
moved
--
as
damages.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
suppose
we
have
a
situation
in
a
neighborhood
schools,
we
do
not
have
that
anymore,
but
suppose
we
did
and
the
board
said
that
the
teacher
in
this
particular
school
must
live
within
the
district.
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
valid
restriction?
unknown
speaker
any
children
that
they
have
that
would
have
to
go
to
the
neighboring
school,
in
the
residence
--
unknown
speaker
well
isn't
it
because
of
the
juries,
because
of
the
statute
now
enacted
by
the
mississippi
legislature,
and
also
because
of
the
runyan
cases
decided
in
this
court,
if
i
may
say.
unknown
speaker
that
amicus
brief.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly,
in
mississippi
there
is
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
he
simply
said
it
was
permissible.
unknown
speaker
that
is
permissible.
unknown
speaker
now
the
mississippi
legislature
said,
it
is
impermissible?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
answer
and
it
is
not
a
constitutional..
unknown
speaker
you
really
have
to
stretch
to
say
that,
that
was
his
holding.
certainly,
my
brother
stewart’s
analysis
is
what
the
holding
of
the
case
was.
you
really
have
to
stretch
to
give
your
construction
to
it.
don't
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
know
this
court
should
make
to
stop
the
district
court
to
decide
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
judge
katie
incorporated
this
in
his
decree.
the
case
might
have
come
out
differently
in
the
fifth
circuit.
judge
colman’s
opinion
certainly
does
not
sound
in
terms
of;
that
this
was
necessary
and
desirable
for
the
court
to
do
it,
sounds
in
terms,
this
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
school
board
if
they
want
to
do
it,
fine,
if
they
do
not
want
to
do
it,
fine.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cochran,
i
wonder
if
you
would
respond
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
your
opponent
about
a
public
employee
working
on
the
far
eastern
desk
being
discharged
for
making
a
speech
against
the
policy.
unknown
speaker
would
you
concede
that
he
could
be
fired
if
there
had
been
evidence
that
children
were
distressed,
or
parents
were
distressed
about
the
inconsistency
between
his
job
as
a
teacher
in
this
very
case.
unknown
speaker
so
the
question
really
turns
largely
on
our
view
of
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
does
your
case
come
down
then
in
contending
that
the
two
lower
courts
were
wrong
in
construing
that
as
efficient
evidence
to
show
a
threat
to
carrying
out...
unknown
speaker
but,
does
your
claim
require
us
to
reexamine
the
facts,
that's
basically...
