mr.
will
a.
hickman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
that
the
calhoun
school
boards
were
under
desegregated
order,
and
pursuant
to
the
mandates
of
this
court
to
take
affirmative
actions,
to
do
what
they
felt
necessary
whatever
steps
to
be
necessary
to
accomplish,
elimination
of
segregation
root
and
branch,
this
board
adapted
a
policy.
the
policy
as
i
stated
an
8/9
that
prior
to
employment
or
re-employment
of
any
teacher,
the
children
of
that
teacher
living
in
calhoun
county
would
attend
the
public
school.
that
is
policy
that
was
stipulated
by
council
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
in
the
district
court.
you
should
keep
in
mind
that
this
was
an
unwritten
policy.
that
it
was
only
stipulated
after
some
discussions
between
the
members
of
the
board,
between
counsels
of
the
petitioners
and
it
was
determined
that
that
was
the
policy.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
the
policy
as
it
was
drafted
on
the
first,
and
as
the
district
court
recognized
applied
lately
to
all
school.
but,
as
the
district
court
found
and
from
the
elements
of
deuce
that
to
hearing,
there
were
no
schools
in
calhoun
county
other
than
this
one
racial
discriminatory,
all-white
private
academy,
which
incidentally
had
plaintiff
charter(ph)
for
organization
19
days
after
courts
desegregation
order.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
no
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
the
president
of
the
board
justified
that,
that
would
have
been
taken
of
that
time,
i
believe
it
is
his
words.
now,
in
all
canniness
the
superintendent
and
the
prospect
testified
that
it
was
a
blanket
policy.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
would
say
that
you
would
have
to
take
the
background
of
this
rule
of
county
school
board,
rule
of
the
superintendent
and
rule
of
principal
in
an
area
where
there
are
no
special
schools.
when
they
said,
it
applied
to
all
schools,
and
if
judge
katie
found
--
we
submit
that
we
are
talking
about
calhoun
academy.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
in
the
academy,
yes
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
it
did.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well
no,
i
would
not
say
the
numbers,
i
would
say
that
this
board
was
under
the
order
of
the
court
and
in
order
for
it
to
attain
the
support
that
it
had
to
have
in
this
community,
it
had
to
make
sure
that
the
teachers,
the
administration
did
support
their
action
in
carrying
out
the
district
court’s
order,
to
eliminate
all
of
these
influence
that
is
lingering
remnants
of
segregation
overruled
in
branch.
and
that
by
this
teacher
being
in
the
classroom
and
as
elements
of
deuce
the
trial
indicates,
that
i
am
standing
in
a
public
classroom,
i
am
paid
from
state
tax
money,
i
am
sending
my
child
to
a
private
school.
the
student
could
perceive
a
rejection
on
the
part
of
the
teacher
and
say,
“alright,
this
school
is
not
fair
enough.
my
child
is
not
going
to
this
school.
i
do
not
think
the
school
is
good
enough?”
mr.
will
a.
hickman
could
we
prohibit
the
teacher?
mr.
will
a.
hickman
justice
marshall,
the
presence
of
the
teacher
in
the
classroom
without
saying
anything.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
your
honor,
during
this
transition
period
and
while
on
the
court
order,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
yes.
i
would
say
that
during
the
transition
parents...
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
would
say
that
during
the
transition
period.
that
if
the
teacher
went
into
crusade,
and
took
action
contrary
to
this
court
order.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
would
not
think
just
one
speech.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well,
i
think
it
will
depend
on
the
effect
that
it
would
have.
i
think
that
depend
on
where
the
speech
was
made,
i
think
that
if
it
was
made
on
part
of
calhoun
county
where
a
lot
of
people
heard
it.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
your
honor,
during
the
transition
period
and
while
this
board
was
on
the
court
order,
if
that
speech
was
made
in
calhoun
county
mississippi
on
a
public
square,
i
would
say
that
the
board
would
have
the
right
to
curtail.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
that
is
correct.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
would
say
that
under
that
circumstance,
--
at
that
point
in
time,
maybe
temporary
and
i
make
this
point.
i
think
that
this
is
a
temporary
action.
we
do
not
contend,
your
honor
that
this
action
is
a
permanent
action.
it
may
well
be
that
in
another
area
in
the
same
school
where
the
teacher
could
apply
on
having
the
child
in
public
school,
it
would
have
the
same
effect,
during
this
transition
period.
this
is
a
problem
area
when
the
board
is
under
the
court
order
to
bring
about
the
de-segregation,
take
affirmative
step,
when
statements
are
such
—
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
say
temporarily,
very
temporarily
and
i
would,
i
say
this,
your
honor.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well,
i
want
to
quote
mathusa
case...
mr.
will
a.
hickman
called
mathusa,
komastus.
it
is
a
case
involving
during
japanese
interment.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
koramatsu,
yes
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well,
i
would
rely
on
the
scumville
(ph)
case,
yes.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well,
we
have
a
fifth
circuit
court
lee
county
v.
mccann
under
the
(inaudible)
case,
where
the
teachers
have
applied
for
their
jobs
in
order
to
obtain
the
ratio,
certain
teachers
were
not
able
to
get
their
job
back.
in
fact,
they
lost
their
jobs
because
of
compliant
with
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
would
think
that
in
this
transition
period
and
with
a
history
of
this
academy,
being
formed
within
the
19
days,
perhaps
the
court
desegregation
orders
that
where
the
teacher
on
the
board
of
directors
in
calhoun
county,
on
this
private
school
that
the
board
would
have
the
right
to
temporarily
curtail.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
think
that
--
was
this
person
employed
by
the
government?
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well,
i
would
think
that
they
had
right
to
curtail.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
yes
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
that
is
correct.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
will
a.
hickman
no
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
yes,
and
the
district
court
limited
of
course
to
policy,
and
fifth
circuit
to
judge
ronnie
to
limits
the
policy.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
yes
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well,
certainly
this
case
--
the
present
statute
prohibits
the
action
that
this
board
took.
i
would
think
that
perhaps
this
action
on
the
legislation
was
prompted
by
this
action
that
this
board
took
in
calhoun
county.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
would
think
that
that
has
merit.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
no
sir,
i
have
not.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
i
did
not,
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
we
felt
that
the
limiting
of
the
section
of
the
policy
by
judge
katie
and
as
stated
by
the
fifth
circuit
was
sufficient
for
the
reason
for
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision.
but,
after
submitting
our
briefs
and
going
into
that
area,
we
frankly
feel
that
those
have
merit.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
yes
sir.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
we
certainly
would
take
the
application.
in
fact,
the
record
does
not
show
that
these
teachers
have
made
their
application
and
made
no
application
to
be
in
the
field.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
yes,
it
would
be
moved,
in
effect
the
statute
was
a
draw
up
till
now,
until
the
determination
was
made.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
if
you
review
the
background,
you
will
find
that
the
comments
that
had
been
made
in
the
community
--
as
actually
brows
v.
browen.
brow
is
the
president
on
the
school
board
attending
this
school
at
this
particular
point
in
time.
that
reference
was
made
to
derogatory
statements
about
those
who
send
their
children
to
school
with
certain
individual
and
this
was
a
background
when
this
policy
was
adapted.
we
submit
that
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
find
the
fact
and
is
compared
by
the
firth
circuit.
it
would
be
a
proper
--
just
petition
on
this
case,
but
in
any
event,
we
do
find
that
there
is
basis
for
this
case
to
be
dismissed
for
the
reason
that
certiorari
be
an
improvident
grant.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well,
i
believe
that
the
courts
have
approved
the
employee
living
within
the
district
and
the
city
where
they
worked
and
on
that
basis,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
will
a.
hickman
well,
if
they
were
in
the
neighborhood
school,
yes,
they
would
be.
and
that
way,
i
do
not
think
that
would
apply
on
its
section,
so.
but
again,
i
think
it
is
in
this
particular
area,
that
point
in
time,
the
particular
facts
as
i
stated,
maybe
in
a
short
time
that
this
had
to
be
done.
what
we
do
not
contend
and
little
did
we
realize
that
when
this
action
was
taken
that
it
would
become
involved
to
this
extent.
that
is
a
temporary
action,
it
may
well
be
that
this
action
is
not
required,
had
the
statute
had
not
been
passed
which
of
course,
now
prohibits.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
feel
this
matter
should
be
affirmed.
