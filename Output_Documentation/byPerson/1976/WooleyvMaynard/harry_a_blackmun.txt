justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
johnson,
why
did
it
take
the
general
court
160
and
some
years
to
arrive
at
this
conclusion?
usually,
they’re
more
traditional
than
that
of
new
hampshire,
aren’t
they?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
johnson,
there
are
some
new
hampshire
plates
that
don’t
carry
the
motto,
aren’t
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
is
the
explanation
for
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
are
sets
(voice
overlap)
exhibit
eight
on
the
page
66
of
the
record.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
because
they
have
to
designate
commercial
or
tractor
or
junk
or
whatever
it
is
they
want?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
a
commercial
vehicle,
a
big
truck
van
might
go
to
california?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there’s
one
other
thing
that
i’m
little
confused
in
the
record
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it’s
inconsistent.
were
the
maynards
willing
or
unwilling
to
purchase
a
vanity
plate?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
they
did
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
wasn’t
anyone
privileged
to
do
that?
