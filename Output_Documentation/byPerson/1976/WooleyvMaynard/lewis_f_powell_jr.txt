devoted
your
argument
up
to
this
time
to
the
constitutional
issue.
are
you
going
to
address
the
younger-huffman

that
you
raise
in
your
brief?
justice

f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
kohn,
in
dyson,
there
was
an
attempt
in
the
prayer
as
i
recall
to
expunge
a
prior
conviction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
didn’t
seek
that
relief
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
kohn.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
attorney
general’s
brief
states
that
the
constitutional
issue
was
raised
at
the
initial
trial
and
was
resolved
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
statute
against
this
appellant,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it
were
correct,
would
you
be
out
in
court
here?
justice
lewis
f.
