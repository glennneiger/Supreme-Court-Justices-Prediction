mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
chief
of
police
of
lebanon,
new
hampshire,
the
director
of
the
new
hampshire
state
police
and
the
commissioner
of
the
new
hampshire
department
of
motor
vehicles,
all
three
of
whom
are
the
appellants
herein.
this
case
presents
to
this
court
two
general
issues.
the
first,
dealing
with
symbolic
speech.
the
issue
being
whether
consistent
with
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
the
state
of
new
hampshire
may
prohibit
by
criminal
sanction
the
knowing
obscuration
of
the
state
motto,
“live
free
or
die”
on
the
license
plates
of
registrants
of
motor
vehicles
in
new
hampshire.
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
appellees
herein
prior
to
the
utilization
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
federal
district
of
new
hampshire
were
obligated
or
should
have
exhausted
their
state
appellate
remedies.
in
1809,
general
john
stark
of
new
hampshire
wrote
a
letter
to
his
vermont
comrades
declining
for
reasons
of
health
to
attend
the
32nd
reunion
of
the
1777
battle
of
bennington,
vermont
in
which
general
stark
had
commanded
the
continental
troops
against
a
decisive
victory
against
the
british
and
germans.
at
the
conclusion
of
his
letter,
general
stark
wrote
to
his
comrades
a
proposed
toast
for
the
reunion.
the
proposed
toast
was
“live
free
or
die,
death
is
not
the
worst
of
evils.”
the
toast
obviously
was
reminiscent
of
the
words
of
patrick
henry
back
in
1775,
“but
as
for
me,
give
me
liberty,
or
give
me
death.”
168
years
after
the
battle
of
bennington,
vermont,
the
new
hampshire
general
court
or
legislature
adapted
the
words,
“life
free
or
die”
as
the
official
state
motto
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
168
years
after
those
words
were
said.
in
1969,
our
legislature
directed
the
director
of
the
division
of
motor
vehicles
to
place
on
all
passenger
vehicles
registered
in
new
hampshire
the
state
motto,
“live
free
or
die.”
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i’m
not
so
sure
justice
rehnquist.
those
environmental
purists
may
be
here
sitting
on
my
right
saying
that
since
new
hampshire
is
no
longer
pure,
we’re
evading
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i’m
not
sure
[laughter].
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
[laughter]
we
adapted
in
new
hampshire
a
state
song,
a
state
seal,
a
state
flower
and
a
state
tree
as
well
as
a
state
motto
in
accordance
with
the
format
of
most
states.
and
while
new
hampshire
was
one
of
the
original
signatories
of
the
decoration
of
independence,
i
don’t
know
the
reason
for
the
delay
in
the
adoption
of
these
state
symbols
but
i
think
that
they
were
adopted
at
a
simultaneous
period
of
time
with
the
adoption
by
other
states
of
state
symbols.
whether
our
conservative
nature
had
anything
to
do
with
it
or
not,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
does
have
some
bearing
because
by
the
legislatures
having
so
declared
this
to
be
the
official
state
motto,
the
legislature
has
in
effect
said
that
the
motto
is
of
importance
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
which
brings
me
to
the
interests
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
in
having
the
motto
on
its
license
plates.
the
motto
not
only
symbolizes
the
heritage
of
new
hampshire,
it
fosters
an
appreciation
of
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
we,
in
our
brief
questioned
the
sincerity
of
the
appellees
and
you
will
find
in
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
evidence
that
mr.
maynard,
while
he
purports
to
be
a
jehovah’s
witness
has
been
dis-fellowshipped
from
the
jehovah
’s
witnesses
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
jehovah’s
witnesses’
churches
had
at
one
time
one
or
more
criminal
prosecutions
against
him.
so,
(a)
we
question
mr.
maynard’s
sincerity
and
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
well,
the
matter
of
sincerity,
i
think
is
two-barreled.
the
first
is
the
question
which
a
moment
ago
was
placed
to
me,
we
have
some
doubts
as
to
his
sincerity.
but
even
accepting
his
sincerity,
we
then
get
to
the
next
issue
which
was
what
he
communicated.
a
particularized
statement
capable
of
being
understood
as
this
court
held
it
must
be
in
spence
versus
washington.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
there
is
evidence
both
ways.
the
state
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i
do
not
concede
the
matter
of
sincerity.
in
spence
versus
--
well
again,
i
think
the
two
questions
are
intertwined.
the
sincerity
of
mr.
maynard
at
the
time
he
undertook
this
act,
i
think
there
is
evidence
both
ways
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
undertaking
this
act
on
a
religious,
conscientious
basis
or
whether
it
was
a
mere
act
of
whimsy
or
bizarre
activity.
and
i
think
there’s
evidence
in
both
ways.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
no,
i
don’t
believe
and
i
don’t
want
to
make
this
particular
issue
greater
than
it
is
necessary
to
the
appellant’s
case.
while
we
question
the
sincerity
of
mr.
maynard,
i
would
submit
that
his
sincerity
is
not
going
to
resolve
the
issues
before
this
court.
and
while
i
say
that
there
is
evidence
both
ways,
assuming
arguendo
the
sincerity
of
mr.
maynard,
i
would
then
argue
that
his
conduct
is
not
in
fact
symbolic
speech.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
my
answer
to
that
is
no
and
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
the
first
is
that
your
hypothetical
is
a
more
poignant
message
in
my
mind
than
the
motto,
“live
free
or
die.”
secondly,
the
motto
“live
free
or
die”
and
its
requirement
that
it’d
be
placed
upon
motor
vehicle
license
plates
has
to
do
with
the
registration
of
motor
vehicles,
the
use
of
the
highways,
and
efficient
registration
system
of
motor
vehicles
and
other
recognizable
interests
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
which
i
think
are
more
important
than
those
that
i
could
enunciate
to
support
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
this
matter
was
raised
at
the
district
court
and
the
commissioner
of
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
testified
in
effect
that
it
would
raise
havoc
with
the
printing
of
the
motor
vehicle
registration
plates,
which
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
it
is.[laughter]
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
death
penalty
for
violation
of
our
statute
relative
to
the
obscuration
of
the
motor
vehicle
license
plates
were
to
be
the
death
penalty
perhaps
sincerity
of
persons
would
be
more
questionable.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
this
is
another
matter,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
this
is
not
a
burning
issue
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
this
is
one
of
the
basis
on
which
i
would
distinguish
this
case
from
the
flag
cases.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
has
remarked
this
past
summer,
i
believe,
at
the
commencement
address
at
one
of
our
national
universities
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i
believe
that
that
was
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
in
which
you
drew
the
distinction
between
the
strong
dissent
of
the
1960’s
and
the
world
peace
of
today.
this
is
not
a
burning
issue,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
new
hampshire.
prior
to
this
particular
case,
there
were
two
combined
cases
before
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
cited
in
the
state’s
brief,
the
state
versus
hoskin
and
eli
in
which
the
defendants
therein
had
taped
over
the
state
motto.
this
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
we
have
sufficient
work
in
new
hampshire
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
it
is
very
important,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
it’s
not
a
burning
issue
from
the
standpoint
that
when
one
goes
to
new
hampshire,
one
sees
the
motto
taped
over.
if
i
may
introduce
a
piece
of
evidence
not
before
the
court
in
my
travels
around
the
state
of
new
hampshire
since
this
case
first
was
instituted,
i
personally
have
yet
to
see
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire
a
license
plate
with
the
state
motto
either
cut
out
or
taped
over.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
well,
most
people
in
new
hampshire
don’t
either.
they
accept
it
as
the
fact
that
it
is
required
to
be
placed
on
their
license
plates
by
the
legislature
in
new
hampshire
which
is
one
of
the
fundamental
basis
upon
which
the
state,
the
appellants
herein
say
that
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
the
appellees
be
said
to
agree
with
the
state
motto
merely
because
it’s
required
to
be
placed
on
their
license
plates.
every
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
certainly.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
there
certainly
would
be
people
who
would
be
here
before
this
court
holding
that
it
was
controversial.
it’s
a
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
well,
i
think
then,
we
get
down
to
a
balancing
issue,
balancing
the
interest
of
the
state
versus
the
eccentric
feelings
of
a
very
small
minority.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
have
adopted
our
motto
and
i
don’t
believe
it
would
be
changed.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
our
motor
vehicle
registration
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
each
plate
has
its
own
numbers
and
each
plate
has
its
own
letters.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
in
a
sense
--
i
believe
that
it
does
because
the
letters
in
new
hampshire
stand
generally
for
our
nine
counties,
and
so
the
counties
do
have
significance.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
well
then,
that
is
what
is
called
in
new
hampshire
a
vanity
plate.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
and
that
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
unfortunately,
all
vanity
plates
in
new
hampshire
have
the
state
motto
on
it,
but
your
question
is,
could
we
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
well
then,
we
come
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
state
of
new
hampshire
is
obligated
to
do
so,
the
legislature
having
authorized
the
motto
to
appear
on
all
passenger
vehicles.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
the
state
has
conceded,
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
its
brief
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
can
undertake
a
workable
system
of
motor
vehicle
registration
without
having
the
motto
on
its
plates.
we
concede
that,
but
we
are
here
on
the
more
fundamental
constitutional
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
in
day
and
age,
in
the
1970’s,
the
state
motto
may
not
be
required
to
be
placed
on
motor
vehicle
license
plates.
on
the
front
of
this
particular
building
is
a
slogan,
is
a
motto
“equal
justice
under
law”
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
with
my
utmost
respect
that
the
work
of
this
court
may
go
on
without
that
motto
being
on
the
front
of
this
building.
in
the
same
way
as
i
concur
with
mr.
justice
marshall
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
may
undertake
a
workable
motor
vehicle
registration
system
without
having
the
motto
on
our
license
plates.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
closer
issue.
the
reason
being
that
i
would
submit
the
words
“live
free
or
die”
do
not
have
the
significant
meaning
that
the
words
“the
mormon
state”
has.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
that
is
correct
and
i
would
point
out
that
almost
every
state
in
the
union
has
mottos
or
slogans
on
its
license
plates
and
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
with
respect
to
the
first
portion
of
your
question,
no.
there
is
no
other
license
plate
professing
a
belief
in
death.
with
respect
to
the
second
aspect
of
your
question,
i
think
that
the
more
particularized
the
message
becomes
then
perhaps
the
more
weight
has
to
be
given
to
the
state
interests.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
[laughters]
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
well,
this
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
this
is
exactly
another
fundamental
case.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
well,
the
appellate
herein
is
a
printer
by
trade
and
one
of
the
arguments
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
herein
is
that
the
statute
under
which
he
is
being
prosecuted
does
not
penalize
him
for
any
disparagement
of
the
motto
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
other
than
a
physical
act
upon
a
license
plate
which
is
in
a
sense
still
a
property
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
there
is
nothing
in
our
statute
which
precludes
mr.
maynard
from
verbalizing
either
by
the
spoken
or
written
word
his
objections
and
dissent
to
the
state
motto.
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
to
prohibit
him
from
doing
anything
other
than
merely
taping
over
or
cutting
out
the
state
motto
on
our
license
plates.
and
with
respect
to
other
statements
on
license
plates,
i
could
run
through
the
variety
of
them
as
up
here
on
the
license
plates
of
various
states.
nebraska,
“the
cornhusker
state,”
does
everyone
seen
a
vehicle
from
nebraska
reasonably
believe
that
the
registrant
of
that
vehicle
necessarily
himself
believes
that
nebraska
is
a
cornhusker
state
or
that
everyone
in
nebraska
is
a
cornhusker?
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i
certainly
would
be
hesitant
having
driven
through
new
jersey
with
all
due
respect
to
new
jersey.
a
license
plate
hangs
out
at
the
end
of
the
vehicle
and
nobody
can
reasonably
say
that
this
is
an
affirmation
of
faith,
a
required
affirmation
of
belief
on
the
part
of
the
registrant
of
a
motor
vehicle.
it’s
different
than
a
flag
burning
case.
it’s
different
than
other
symbols
and
mottos.
it
doesn’t
have
the
emotional
charge
of
a
flag
or
even
the
emotional
charge
of
a
draft
card
and
the
appellants
herein
would
ask
this
court
to
draw
an
analogy
between
the
burning
of
a
draft
card
in
the
o’brien
case
and
the
destruction
of
a
duly
issued
motor
vehicle
registration
by
the
state
of
new
hampshire
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
there
are.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
by
supplementary
statement
in
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
there
are
general
rules,
motor
vehicle
regulations
relating
to
different
types
of
vehicles,
and
that
is
one
of
the
basic
reasons
why
some
plates
are
designated
commercial
or
some
plates
are
designated
tractor.
a
commercial
vehicle
or
an
agricultural
vehicle
for
instance
may
travel
only
15
miles
from
its
usual
place
of
resting.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
that
is
correct,
but
it’s
designated
as
commercial
and
has
to
pay
highway
usage
taxes
and
so
forth
which
a
passenger
vehicle
does
not.
in
other
words,
the
various
designations
are
in
response
to
various
motor
vehicle
laws
relative
to
those
particular
types
of
vehicles.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
thank
you,
mr.
justice
powell.
the
state
relies
primarily
on
younger
versus
harris
and
huffman
versus
pursue.
in
this
particular
case,
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
necessity
for
the
federal
district
court
having
become
involved.
the
appellee,
mr.
maynard,
in
each
of
the
three
cases
in
which
he
appeared
before
the
lowest
of
our
courts
in
new
hampshire,
had
the
alternative
of
having
an
appeal
by
trial
de
novo
before
jury
in
the
superior
court
of
asking
that
questions
of
law
be
transferred
to
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
and
he
undertook
none
of
those
available
remedies.
in
huffman
versus
pursue,
this
court
held
that
even
where
a
criminal
action
has
been
commenced
and
has
terminated,
federal
intervention
carries
with
it
all
those
disadvantages
that
it
would
if
a
criminal
proceeding
were
still
ongoing.
federal
intervention
in
this
particular
case,
for
example,
is
an
aspersion
upon
the
abilities
of
the
courts
of
new
hampshire
to
resolve
constitutional
issues
and
mr.
justice
brennan
in
may
before
the
new
jersey
bar
association
pointed
out
that
in
this
day
and
age,
the
state
courts
are
protecting
the
rights
of
citizens
to
even
a
greater
state
extent
than
the
federal
courts.
and
i
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
these
courts
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
are
just
as
capable
of
interpreting
the
federal
constitution
and
our
own
constitution
as
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
the
wife
has
never
been
prosecuted.
i
would
point
out
that
--
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
i
would
submit
that
under
doran
versus
salem
inn,
inc.,
and
under
ellis
versus
dyson
that
there
is
no
controversy
pending
and
that
the
parties
are
so
closely
related
that
they
should
be
treated
as
one
entity.
i
would
respectfully
request
that
my
remaining
minute
or
two
be
reserved.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
very
briefly
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices.
during
my
direct
remarks,
i
was
inquired
as
to
whether
the
state
of
new
hampshire
is
before
this
court
seriously.
we
are
here
seriously.
there
are
many
mottos
which
we
have
in
this
country
and
i
think
this
is
an
important
case.
“in
god
we
trust”
is
upon
our
coins
and
currency.
“e
pluribus
unum”
is
upon
our
coins
and
currency.
“equal
justice
under
law”
is
upon
the
edifice
in
which
we
appear
today.
i
think
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
preservation
of
certain
slogans
and
mottos.
next,
i
would
point
out
that
we
lawyers
are
required
to
be
members
of
bar
associations
in
many
states
and
yet
by
that
requirement,
it
is
not
implicit
that
we
agree
with
what
the
bar
association
in
each
state
says
or
stands
for.
when
we
place
postage
stamps
on
our
envelopes,
those
postage
stamps
contain
symbols
and
mottos.
“liberty
depends
on
freedom
of
the
press”
issued
november
13,
1975
by
the
united
states
government
and
i’m
not
sure
whether
every
member
of
the
judiciary
necessarily
would
believe
in
that
particular
motto.
and
certainly,
if
a
member
of
the
judiciary
were
to
place
a
stamp
bearing
that
motto,
“liberty
depends
on
freedom
of
the
press”
upon
a
letter,
no
one
reasonably
would
believe
that
he
necessarily
concurs
with
the
sentence.
mr.
robert
v.
johnson,
ii
but
if
your
secretary,
mr.
justice
marshall
placed
such
a
stamp
on
a
letter,
i
don’t
think
that
if
i
were
to
receive
the
letter,
i
would
necessarily
believe
that
you
believed
in
that
particular
motto
merely
because
it
was
upon
your
letter.
i
think
it’s
important
in
this
case
also
that
the
defendant
mutilated
the
license
plates.
he
cut
out
the
words.
and
i
think
finally,
it’s
important
that
there
was
no
particular
message
enunciated
by
the
conduct
of
the
appellees.
the
district
court
found
that
by
his
conduct,
he
expressed
a
particular
message,
a
message
which
indicated
his
objections.
i
would
submit
that
if
you
were
to
examine
the
plaintiff’s
exhibit
number
one
which
is
before
this
court,
the
particular
license
plate,
in
its
condition
and
ask
yourselves
what
message
was
conveyed
by
this
act
of
whimsy
that
you
would
find
no
message
conveyed.
and
for
these
reasons,
the
state
would
ask
you
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
thank
you.
