mr.
richard
s.
kohn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
the
younger
abstention
issue
first.
the
purpose
behind
the
younger
v.
harris
and
the
other
cases
that
the
court
has
decided,
expanding
younger,
has
been
to
permit
the
state
courts
to
try
cases
free
from
the
interference
of
the
federal
courts.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
interference
with
any
state
litigation.
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
in
federal
court,
there
were
no
pending
prosecutions.
this
was
not
a
collateral
attack
on
any
of
mr.
maynard’s
prior
convictions
and
it
was
not
an
attempt
to
use
the
federal
courts
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct,
your
honor
and
i
should
say
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
time
i
filed
the
federal
suit,
i
did
not
know
about
the
third
conviction
for
which
mr.
maynard
had
received
a
disposition
of
continued
first
sentence.
i
didn’t
find
out
about
that
and
so
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
sir.
but
at
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court,
the
state
stipulated
that
under
new
hampshire
practice,
that
is
a
final
disposition.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no,
only
we
asked
for
prospect
of
injunctive
relief.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
samuels
v.
mackell,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
samuels
v.
mackell,
your
honor,
was
a
case
where
the
federal
plaintiffs
were
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
at
the
same
time
that
there
was
an
ongoing
state
prosecution.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
and
the
court
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
did
address
the
question
of
standing
in
that
case.
but
in
boyle,
the
court
characterized
the
plaintiff’s
standing
as
a
search
through
the
statute
books
to
try
to
find
the
statute
to
attack,
if
i
remember
the
case
correctly.
in
this
case,
mr.
maynard
had
been
prosecuted.
at
the
time
i
filed
the
federal
action,
i
knew
at
least
two
times
that
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
not
going
to
alter
his
religious
beliefs
and
that
unless
we
filed
the
suit
and
got
an
injunction,
he
would
either
not
be
able
to
use
his
car
or
be
subject
to
more
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
maynard
was
in
a
situation
where
because
of
his
religious
beliefs,
he
was
going
to
be
subject
to
a
series
of
repeated
prosecutions
unless
the
court
intervened
and
stopped
it.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
i
did.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no,
your
honor.
dyson
in
effect
looked
backwards.
they
were
seeking
an
expungement
of
arrest
records.
they
asked
for
an
injunction
to
accomplish
that.
they
also
asked
for
declaratory
judgment
which
looked
to
the
future.
our
case
looked
only
to
the
future
and
that’s
the
distinction
between
ours
and
dyson
v.
ellis.
the
exhaustion
requirement
that
the
state
would
have
the
court
engraft
onto
1983
action
under
these
circumstances
in
effect
would
bring
the
exhaustion
requirement
that’s
presently
applied
in
habeas
corpus
actions
into
the
1983
area.
our
response
to
that
is
to
say
that
in
the
habeas
corpus
area,
it
makes
sense
to
require
a
litigant
to
exhaust
his
state
remedies
because
he’s
seeking
release
from
confinement
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
state
court
should
have
the
first
crack
at
resolving
any
constitutional
difficulties
along
the
way.
but
again,
that
is
not
the
situation
in
our
case.
we
are
no
way
attacking
or
impugning
the
ability
of
the
state
courts
to
resolve
these
issues
and
we
are
not
seeking
any
relief
with
respect
to
prior
convictions.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
your
honor,
i
did
not
represent
mr.
maynard
in
the
state
court
proceedings
since
he
had
a
lawyer.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
after
his
first
conviction
on
december
6,
the
sentence
was
suspended.
there
was
no
reason
to
appeal
that.
his
second
conviction
occurred
on
january
31
and
he
was
again
ordered
to
pay
a
fine.
the
judge
then
walked
out
of
the
courtroom.
mr.
maynard
explained
that
--
and
at
that
point,
the
judge
advised
mr.
maynard
that
he
had
a
right
to
appeal.
the
judge
then
left
the
courtroom.
mr.
maynard
explained
to
the
clerk
that
he
could
not
pay
the
fines
out
of
conscience.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
and
at
that
point,
the
judge
returned
and
sentenced
him
to
15
days
in
prison
and
he
was
immediately
taken
to
jail,
so
even
if
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
your
honor,
under
new
hampshire
law,
notice
of
an
appeal
to
the
superior
court
for
trial
de
novo
must
be
filed
at
the
time
sentence
is
declared.
there
is
a
provision
for
a
late
appeal
which
may
be
filed
within
three
days
after
sentence
is
declared,
and
there
is
a
further
provision
that
you
can
petition
the
superior
court
for
permission
within
30
days
after
sentence
is
declared.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
he
didn’t
have
a
lawyer
--
he
could’ve,
your
honor.
but
for
one
thing,
he
didn’t
have
a
lawyer
and
he
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
mr.
maynard
told
the
judge
that
he
wanted
to
represent
himself.
he
did
not
say
he
could
not
pay
for
a
lawyer.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
don’t
think
that’s
accurate
at
all,
your
honor.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
mr.
maynard
got
out
of
jail,
he
made
attempts
to
contact
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
i
think
up
until
that
point,
he
believed
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
he
had
made
attempts
to
contact
the
civil
liberty
union
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
think
that
i
would
agree
with,
your
honor,
that
once
i
was
retained,
we
chose
the
federal
courts
as
our
forum.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggest
that
mr.
maynard
with
his
ninth
grade
education
would’ve
known
how
to
take
an
appeal
up
through
the
new
hampshire
state
court.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
that
may
be
true.
the
statutes
are
on
the
books.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
the
statutes
that
were
on
the
books
that
there
was
an
appeal
mechanism.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
your
honor,
for
one
thing,
taking
his
appeal
up
through
the
state
courts
would
not
have
solved
mr.
maynard’s
problem.
his
problem
was
to
obtain
injunctive
relief
so
he
could
drive
his
automobile.
the
new
hampshire
system
of
appeals
is
a
two-tier
system
which
this
court
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
where
after
your
conviction
in
district
court,
you
can
appeal
for
trial
de
novo
in
superior
court.
from
the
superior
court,
then
you
can
go
to
the
state
supreme
court.
i’ve
never
heard
of
the
case
where
a
lower
court
in
a
criminal
prosecution
has
issued
an
injunction
against
the
state
to
prevent
them
from
enforcing
the
statute
which
is
at
issue.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
sir.
there
is.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
would’ve
been
after
a
substantial
period
of
time.
but
when
mr.
maynard
got
out
of
jail
on
february
28,
1975,
he
didn’t
use
his
car
until
the
federal
court
action
was
filed
and
he
would
not
have
used
his
car
until
the
constitutional
issue
was
resolved
in
some
court.
that
could’ve
been
a
matter
of
many
months.
and
there
is
testimony
in
the
transcript
on
our
motion
for
temporary
restraining
order
that
this
nonsense
affected
his
ability
to
earn
a
livelihood
and
that
was
the
critical
thing
for
mr.
maynard.(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
these
repeated
arrests
of
mr.
maynard
for
taping
over
his
license
plate.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
your
honor.
i’d
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
question
about
the
transfer.
there
is
a
transfer
procedure
in
new
hampshire
and
if
the
justice
of
the
district
court
so
permits,
you
can
transfer
a
case
direct
to
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
but
district
courts
in
new
hampshire
are
not
courts
of
record.
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
state
supreme
court
without
a
record
which
in
view
of
the
state’s
consistent
attacks
on
mr.
maynard’s
sincerity
in
the
federal
courts
i
think
would’ve
been
a
very
poor
mistake.
and
this
court
many
times,
has
stated
in
its
opinions
that
constitutional
issues
take
on
color
from
the
factual
surroundings
in
which
they
arise.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
believe
it’s
incorrect,
your
honor,
and
the
three-judge
court
said
that
it
was
incorrect.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
not
on
younger
principles,
your
honor.
i
think
then
the
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
res
judicata
which
is
what
i
think
the
state
is
really
arguing
in
this
case.
their
whole
younger
argument
is
really
addressed
at
this
res
judicata.
but
our
answer
to
that
is
that
it
was
waived.
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
are
affirmative
defenses
that
have
to
be
raised
by
the
state
and
they
did
not
do
so
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
the
rules
provide
that
--
first
of
all,
your
honor,
the
district
court
did
not
pass
on
them.
the
district
court
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
read
its
opinion
as
being
strictly
over
the
dictum
that
if
the
state
had
raised
that
argument,
they
would’ve
rejected
it,
but
i
think
that
the
burden
is
on
the
state
or
the
defending
party
to
raise
its
affirmative
defenses
in
conformity
to
the
federal
rules.
so
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
sir.
well,
not
in
my
position
but
i
would
ask
that
if
the
court
feels
that
you
want
that
the
issue
of
whether
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
apply
to
1983
actions,
then
you
direct
the
parties
to
brief
that
because
the
state
hasn’t
briefed
it
and
we
haven’t
responded
to
it
and
it’s
a
question
of
infinite
complexity
that
should
receive
full
briefing.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
res
judicata
wouldn’t
apply
in
any
event
and
they
did
waive
that.
they
did
raise
collaterals
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct.
they
did
raise
the
collateral
estoppel
argument
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court
when
we
began
the
case
and
judge
bownes
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
i
have
assumed
that
in
my
brief,
your
honor.
although,
i
know
that
some
courts
say
it
only
applies
to
issues
of
fact.
there
are
federal
courts
that
have
applied
it
to
questions
of
law.
but
in
any
event,
the
state
has
not
pursued
that
issue.
they
raised
that
before
judge
bownes.
he
decided
against
them.
they
did
not
raise
it
again
before
the
three-judge
court.
as
i
note
in
my
brief,
there’s
a
question
as
to
whether
judge
bownes
should
have
denied
that
particular
motion
the
way
he
did,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
state
abandoned
it
and
the
only
time
they’ve
mentioned
it
since
is
in
its
brief
and
not
as
jurisdictional
statement
that
was
filed
to
this
court.
and
i
would
again
ask
that
if
the
court
feels
that
that
issue
should
be
reached
in
this
case
that
we
should
be
able
to
brief
it.
there’s
an
additional
question
which
the
state
sort
of
combined
with
its
younger
argument,
but
which
we
feel
is
a
separate
question
and
that
goes
to
the
permanent
injunctive
relief
that
the
district
court
entered.
again,
this
is
an
issue
we
feel
the
state
has
waived
and
the
district
court
said
that
the
state
did
not
dispute
it,
that
the
federal
court
could
issue
an
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
arrest
and
prosecutions
and
that’s
what
they
did
in
this
case.
i
would
want
to
point
out
that
there
were
no
prosecutors
or
judges
as
defendants
in
this
case.
the
reason
we
asked
for
an
injunction
against
arrest
and
prosecution
is
in
new
hampshire,
frequently,
police
officers
initiate
prosecutions
in
district
court
and
the
injunction
that
the
court
issued
only
runs
to
those
individuals.
this
was
an
extremely
narrow
injunction.
it
was
nothing
like
the
injunction
that
was
issued
in
rickshaw
v.
good
which
involved
the
internal
workings
of
a
police
department.
all
this
injunction
directed
was
that
maynards
not
to
be
arrested
or
prosecuted
for
the
offense
of
taping
over
the
motto
on
their
license
plates.
the
state
has
briefed
another
issue
with
respect
to
mrs.
maynard
and
they’ve
argued
that
her
action
be
dismissed
based
on
some
language
in
doran
v.
salem
inn
that
she
and
her
husband
were
so
closely
intertwined
that
if
he
is
barred
by
younger
then
she
must
be.
the
common
law,
a
husband
and
wife
are
one
and
the
husband
was
the
one,
but
that
is
no
longer
the
case.
mrs.
maynard’s
action
was
not
a
subterfuge
to
circumvent
younger
considerations.
she
had
standing
on
her
own.
she
was
threatened
with
prosecution.
she
shares
her
husband’s
religious
beliefs
and
there’s
no
question
but
that
she
had
article
3
standing
and
we
would
argue
that
irrespective
of
whether
younger
governs
mr.
maynard’s
case,
mrs.
maynard
must
proceed
to
the
merits.
central
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
action
of
the
maynards
in
placing
reflective
tape
over
the
state
motto
on
their
license
plates
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
as
symbolic
expression
and
whether
the
state’s
interests
are
substantial
enough
to
override
that
expression.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
definitely
and
i
would
argue
that
there
is
a
third
separate
issue
which
involves
the
free
exercise
clause
because
mr.
maynard’s
belief
and
mrs.
maynard’s
belief
is
religiously-based.
and
i
would
see
those
as
three
separate
arguments.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
the
free
exercise
clause,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
because
mr.
maynard’s
beliefs
are
religiously-based
and
that
the
imposition
by
the
state
of
this
motto
upon
him
which
is
offensive
to
those
beliefs
violates
his
freedom
of
exercise.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that’s
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
i
think
that
would
fall
within
--
most
of
the
mottos
that
appear
on
state
license
plates.
if
a
state
wants
to
advertise
it
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no.
absolutely
not.
north
carolina
is
first
in
freedom
and
i
know
there
had
been
problems
with
respect
to
that.
but
nevertheless,
most
of
the
slogans
that
appear
on
license
plates
advertise
a
state
as
a
vacation
land
or
a
sportsman’s
paradise
or
it’s
a
tourist
attraction
or
something
that
is
neutral
and
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
think
that’s
right.
i
think
that
if
he
taped
over
the
gambling,
that
would
be
an
exercise
of
symbolic
expression
and
i
think
before
the
issue
of
the
environmentalist
came
up,
if
a
state
advertises
itself
as
a
“garden
state”
or
a
scenic
state
and
someone
is
deeply
offended
by
that,
i
think
that
is
symbolic
expression.
our
case
is
much
stronger
because
mr.
maynard’s
beliefs
are
religiously-based.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
is
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
seven
states;
north
dakota,
south
dakota,
vermont,
delaware,
puerto
rico
and
north
carolina
specifically
say
in
their
statutes
that
the
state
retains
title
to
a
license
plate
while
it’s
in
the
possession
of
the
individual.
in
new
hampshire
it
does
not.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no.
and
i
wouldn’t
want
to
suggest
that
if
someone
came
into
this
court
next
week
with
a
north
carolina
license
plate
that
the
case
should
turn
on
whether
the
state
asserts
title
or
not.
needless
that
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
there
are
at
least
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
statute
which
makes
that
a
crime
require
a
fraudulent
intent,
so
i
don’t
think
there
would
be
a
violation
of
law
at
least
under
the
present
statute
that
we’re
dealing.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
secondly,
if
someone
chose
to
really
object
to
the
motto
“in
god
we
trust”
and
put
tape
over
it,
the
way
mr.
maynard
does
to
his
license
plates,
i
do
not
think
that
he
could
be
criminally
punished
for
that.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
this
is
not
mutilation,
your
honor.
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
spence.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
think
it
might,
your
honor.
well,
i
know
it
would
be
mutilation
and
i
think
that
the
state
could
probably
make
that
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
in
the
beginning,
yes
your
honor.
he
has
to
tape
the
motto
over
and
neighborhood
children
would
cut
out
the
words
“or
dies,”
or
neighborhood
children
would
pull
the
tape
off.
so
eventually,
he
cut
out
the
words
“or
die”
and
then
put
the
tape
over
the
whole
thing.
but
when
we
filed
our
suit,
he
have
just
been
issued
a
new
plates
for
1975
and
we
have
never
suggested
that
he’d
be
able
to
cut
out
or
actually
physically
mutilate
the
license
plates.
that
is
not
an
issue.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
they
stated
that
they
were
willing
to
purchase
a
license
plate
that
did
not
contain
the
motto
“live
free
or
die.”
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
they
were
not
offered
that
opportunity
by
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
the
vanity
plates
in
new
hampshire
is
they’re
currently
printed
up
all
contain
the
motto
“live
free
or
die”
and
it
would’ve
required
removing
the
“die”
that
says
“live
free
or
die”
and
there
is
testimony
in
the
transcript
that
that
could
be
done
without
a
lot
of
difficulty
but
the
state
never
said
that
that
could
be
done.
as
matter
of
fact,
i
think
they
said
it
couldn’t
be
done.
i
believe
i’m
accurately
stating
the
state’s
position.
the
first
issue
under
the
symbolic
speech
question
is
whether
there
was
an
intent
to
convey
a
particularized
message
and
whether
that
message
is
likely
to
be
understood.
contrary
to
what
the
state
has
represented
here,
this
issue
of
“live
free
or
die”
on
the
license
plates
is
a
very
hot
issue
in
new
hampshire.
it
has
been
to
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
this
very
case
was
delayed
for
eight
months
while
the
legislature
considered
a
bill
that
would’ve
made
inclusion
of
the
state
motto
optional.
people
are
well
aware
in
new
hampshire
about
the
controversy
around
the
motto
and
there’s
testimony
in
the
record
on
page
29,
for
example,
by
mr.
maynard
that
people
would
stop
him
when
they
saw
the
tape
over
his
license
plate
and
that
would
give
him
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
them
about
his
beliefs.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
question
but
that
this
was
a
--
that
he
had
a
particularized
intent
and
the
people
would
understand
the
message.
the
state
interests
that
have
been
advanced
by
new
hampshire
prior
to
individualism,
history
and
tourism
as
the
district
court
held
are
not
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
expression.
for
the
obvious
reason
that
it’s
only
by
conveying
the
message
that
the
state
gets
the
point
across,
whatever
the
point
may
be.
orthodoxy
of
thought
can
be
fostered
not
only
by
penalizing
those
who
are
deviant
in
their
expressions,
but
also
by
granting
special
privilege
and
special
status
to
messages
that
meet
the
state’s
approval
and
this
is
very
much
like
the
schacht
case
where
there
was
a
statute
that
permitted
the
american
uniform
to
be
worn
in
theatrical
productions
that
glorified
or
appraised
the
military
but
not
otherwise
and
that
is
what
the
state
has
done
here.
they’ve
selected
a
message
which
they
want
to
project,
they
select
a
billboard
as
it
will
appear
on
all
non-commercial
license
plates
in
state
and
then
they
make
it
a
criminal
offense
to
cover
that
over.
so,
it’s
not
unrelated
to
the
suppression
of
expression
and
unless
the
state
can
come
up
with
some
compelling
need
or
unless
they
can
show
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
their
interest
cannot
be
served
otherwise
then
that
is
not
a
valid
justification.
the
other
interest
they
advanced
is
that
it
helps
their
system
of
motor
vehicle
registration,
but
the
motto
is
nonfunctional.
it
does
not
serve
any
purpose
on
the
license
plate
unlike
the
numbers
or
the
name
of
the
state
or
the
date.
and
it’s
our
position
that
the
state
lacks
the
power
to
require
its
citizens
to
bear
this
sort
of
motto.
and
as
the
chief
justice
was
asking
before,
i
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
uphold
this
sort
of
thing,
then
the
state
could
require
all
citizens
to
wear
a
pin
or
an
armband
or
they
could
require
you
to
have
a
plat
on
your
door
next
your
address
saying
“live
free
or
die.”
i’m
sorry.
do
you
have
a
question
your
honor?
and
beyond
that,
there’s
evidence
in
the
record
that,
at
least
with
regard
to
the
maynard’s
plate,
there’s
no
duplicate
plate
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
so
it
would
not
present
any
problem
of
identification.
this
is
not
an
o’brien
case
as
my
brother
counsel
said
before.
o’brien
involved
the
war
power,
one
of
the
most
pervasive
powers
that
you
could
imagine
under
our
system
of
government.
also,
o’brien
destroyed
and
mutilated
his
draft
card.
that
was
the
whole
point
of
the
exercise.
mr.
maynard
is
not
destroying
the
plate.
the
war
power
is
not
involved
here.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
your
honor,
i
just
think
that
the
interest
of
the
state
is
advanced
in
this
particular
case
come
no
where
near
the
war
power.
it
may
be
that
the
state
has
other
powers
under
its
police
power
or
powers
dealing
with
the
welfare
of
its
citizens
that
could
be
equatable
with
the
war
powers
compared
with
national
government,
but
certainly,
in
terms
of
the
interest
that
the
state
has
advanced
in
this
case,
there’s
no
comparison.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
[laughters]
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that
would
be
a
tough
one.
i
think
everyone
would
agree
with
that.[laughter]
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
you
do
reach
a
point.
i’m
sure
my
brother
counsel
would
argue
that
some
people
would
disagree
that
some
state
is
a
vacation
land
or
that
mississippi
is
the
hospitality
state.
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
that
if
someone
has
a
conscientious
opposition
to
this,
thinks
that
it
isn’t
true,
that
would
be
a
case
of
symbolic
expression
if
they
taped
it
over.
and
unless
the
state
can
show
some
overriding
need
for
that
motto,
then
there
can
be
no
criminal
penalties
that
attach.
and,
i
should
make
another
point
in
connection
with
that.
it’s
essential
to
understand
this
case
that
it
is
criminal
penalties
that
are
involved.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
[laughter
attempt]
i
suppose
it
does,
your
honor.
i
suppose
it
does.
it
does
involve
liberty
and
i
think
that
it
probably
would
be
protected
expression
if
someone
covered
it.
in
any
event,
i
would
argue
that
the
motto
in
this
particular
case
is
so
different
from
these
that
it
almost
stands
sui
generis.
“live
free
or
die”
or
“the
mormon
state”
or
“amnesty
now”
or
any
politically
loaded
message
that
is
bound
to
offend
sensibilities
cannot
withstand
a
first
amendment
attack.
with
respect
to
the
barnette
issue
which
mr.
justice
stewart
mentioned,
the
state’s
response
to
this
and
they
didn’t
actually
briefed
this,
but
they
relied
on
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court’s
decision
in
hoskin
was
that,
well,
everybody
knows
that
the
state
motto
is
required,
therefore,
it
can’t
offend
the
barnett
principle,
but
i
find
that
totally
un-understandable.
barnett
itself
could
have
been
explained
on
those
grounds.
everyone
knows
that
children
have
to
salute
the
flags,
so
it
doesn’t
matter.
well,
that’s
not
the
issue
in
these
cases.
the
issue
is
whether
it’s
an
affront
to
the
particular
individual’s
deeply
held
beliefs.
i
think
that
that
concludes
my
presentation
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
thank
you.
