justice
john
paul
stevens
general
johnson,
could
i
interrupt
before
you
get
to
the
state
interest?
do
you
challenge
the
district
court’s
finding
that
the
appellees’
motivation
was
based
on
a
fundamental
religious
belief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
challenge
that
it
is
clearly
erroneous
and
you
ask
us
to
set
this
aside
to
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
write
that
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
would
think
so.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you’d
disagree
and
there
is
evidence
which
you
point
out
that
may
cast
doubt
on
the
district
court’s
finding.
but,
is
there
not
some
evidence
in
the
record
which
would
require
us
to
accept
the
finding
as
not
being
clearly
erroneous?
didn’t
he
testify
that
it
was
a
religious
belief
and
so
forth
that’s
illegal
behind
the
district
court’s
findings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
concede
that,
don’t
we
have
to
accept
the
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was
burning
enough
for
you
to
appeal,
i
think,
wasn’t
it?(inaudible)
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
johnson,
just
to
give
you
a
question
somewhat
like
the
one
that
the
chief
justice
asked.
supposing
the
state
of
utah
adopted
a
motto,
“the
mormon
state”
and
then
tried
to
put
that
on
its
license
plates,
would
that
be
permissible?
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose,
if
one
was
a
christian
scientist
and
didn’t
believe
in
death,
it
might
have
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
other
states
that
have
mottos
that
profess
the
belief
in
death?
and
why
a
belief
in
death
any
different
from
a
belief
in
the
mormon
religion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i’m
a
little
puzzled
about
the
res
judicata
argument
because
i
don’t
understand
you
to
be
attacking
the
judgments
or
any
of
those
judgments
that
have
been
entering?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn’t
waive
it.
you’re
not
attacking
those
judgments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
collateral
estoppel
apply
to
issues
of
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mt.
kohn,
do
you
think
an
atheist
could
cross
out
the
words
or
tape
over
the
words
“in
god
we
trust”
on
an
american
currency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
constitutional
right
to
do
that
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let’s
assume
the
statute
is
revised.
justice
john
paul
stevens
(voice
overlap)
prosecutions,
didn’t
he
deface
the
plate?
