justice
thurgood
marshall
on
a
sincerity,
he
went
jailed,
didn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
--
usually,
non-sincere
people,
they
go
up
to
closing
of
the
door
but
they
usually
change,
don’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
a
different
question.(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
if
we
rule
in
favor
of
the
appellees,
then
everybody
would
take
it
over
and
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
everybody’s
in
favor
of
getting
rid
of
it,
you
ought
to
get
rid
of
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
understand
that
the
attorney
general’s
offer
doesn’t
have
anything
else
to
do
that’s
why
they
brought
it
up
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
important
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it’s
not
a
burning
issue?
justice
thurgood
marshall
since
you
speak
as
an
individual,
the
first
time
i
noticed
the
motto
was
after
this
case
was
filed.
i
have
never
paid
any
attention
to
it.
i
mean,
new
hampshire
license,
(inaudible)
new
hampshire,
but
i
didn’t
live
or
die
about
it.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
a
minute
ago,
you
said
that
it
would
be
very
troublesome
to
issue
license
plates
without
the
sign.
i
saw
a
license
plate
in
new
hampshire
a
week
ago
that
had
letters
“er”
on
it,
or
“ab”
or
something,
with
two
letters,
that
was
pretty
special,
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn’t
that
stand
special?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean,
they
go
from
1
to
9000,
that’s
a
machine
job,
but
the
letters
“er”
is
not
a
machine
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
no
computer
runs
on
er?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
didn't
have
any
numbers
behind
it,
it
just
had
letters.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
you
make
a
vanity
plate
for
this
man,
if
he’d
pay
for
it
and
leave
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
couldn’t
you
make
a
vanity
plate
without
the
motto?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i’m
saying
is
it
wouldn’t
be
any
harder
than
just
set
the
vanity
plates.
i’m
not
arguing
the
law
about
it.
i’m
arguing
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
if
you
do
it
like
we
do
it
in
virginia?
we
don’t
have
it
on
our
license
plates,
but
we
have
stickers
i
see
a
lot
of
people
paste
it
on
the
bumper
“virginia
is
for
lovers”.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
they
didn’t
put
it
on
the
license
plate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
buy
the
sticker
and
say
what
you
want.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
that
case,
the
appellee
here
wouldn’t
have
any
trouble,
would
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
why
didn’t
you
take
the
first
case
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
didn’t
maynard
take
it
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
did
not
intend
to
pay
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn’t
he
appeal
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
answer
is
they
could
have
gone
through
all
of
the
courts
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
because
he
couldn’t
afford
a
lawyer
with
two
automobiles?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
still
had
them
all
available
to
him
and
eventually,
when
he
decided
to
abandon
the
new
hampshire
courts,
he
found
a
lawyer
to
get
him
into
the
federal
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what’s
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
the
point
was
when
he
needed
a
lawyer,
he
got
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
couldn’t
see
how
we
could
take
all
of
these
into
effect.
what
i’m
merely
asking
you,
he
had
remedies
available
in
the
state
courts.
rather
than
to
use
those,
he
used
the
federal
court
and
i’m
not
asking
you
a
question.
i’m
telling
you
that’s
what
he
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
care
on
anything
about
you
being
retained.
i’m
talking
about
what
the
records
show.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
something
in
the
record
that
the
judge
did
advise
him
and
that
statutes
do
provide
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
had
available
to
him
a
direct
appeal
in
the
machinery
of
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
maybe?
is
it
or
not
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
judge
advised
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what
else
was
the
state
require
to
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
say
nonsense,
what
were
you
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
about
his
repeated
violation
of
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
could
be
nonsense
too,
couldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kohn,
then
you
don’t
agree
that
the
license
plates
belong
to
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assumed
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
statute
was
mutilated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’ll
put
cut
out
words
with
a
razor
blade
“in
god
we
trust,”
would
that
be
mutilation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
usually,
we
don’t
put
stamps
on
letter.[laughter]
