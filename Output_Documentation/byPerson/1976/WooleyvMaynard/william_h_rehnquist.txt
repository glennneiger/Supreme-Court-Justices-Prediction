if
you
had
kept
it
just
seen
at
new
hampshire,
you
would
have
avoided
this
litigation,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it’s
likely
that
either
the
hypotheticals
put
to
you
by
the
chief
justice
would
be
adopted
by
the
new
hampshire
legislature
of
the
state
motto
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
flags
and
the
flag
burning
cases
were
all
the
property
of
the
person
who
burned
them,
were
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
have
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
boyle
against
landry.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
said
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
surely,
the
new
hampshire
prosecutor
wouldn’t
continue
to
enforce
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
state
doesn’t
raise
them,
but
the
district
court
nonetheless
passes
on
it
as
the
district
court
did
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
have
read
its
opinion
to
pass
on
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
have
lots
of
cases
that
under
our
rules,
you
must
have
raised
a
point,
at
the
earliest
possible
point
in
state
proceedings,
but
nonetheless,
we’ve
also
held
that
if
a
state’s
supreme
court
passes
on
the
point
even
though
it
didn’t
have
to
then
the
issue
is
open
for
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
nevada
said
“gambler’s
paradise”
and
nevada
citizen
said,
“i
am
just
that
i’m
very
fundamentally
opposed
to
gambling.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
state
is
more
limited
on
the
exercise
of
its
residual
powers
than
congress
is
when
it’s
exercising
the
war
power
each
one
confronted
by
the
same
constitutional
guarantee?
