chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
75-1453,
wooley
against
maynard.
mr.
johnson,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
also
have
some
copyright
problems
with
the
words
of
patrick
henry
on
virginia
on
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
your
case
depend
upon
this
having
been
declared
the
motto
of
the
state
officially
by
the
legislature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
justice
marshall
suggested
in
one
of
his
questions,
do
people
ordinarily
go
along
and
spend
five
days
at
a
time
in
jail
just
to
pamper
a
whimsy?
that’s
some
evidence
of
a
sincere
belief,
however,
a
misguided
one
might
think
it
is
and
do
you
rest
on
the
fact
that
he
is
departed
from
a
particular
faith
that
as
a
dissident
as
undermining
his
sincerity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
state
of
new
hampshire
could
require
citizens
to
carry
signs,
picket
signs,
to
support
the
united
nations
in
a
sincere
belief
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
that
it
was
very
important
to
support
the
efforts
and
work
of
the
united
nations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
state
just
as
well
offer
its
citizens,
its
automobile
owners,
an
option,
but
if
they
did
not
want
that
motto
on
the
license,
they
could
be
omitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
speaking
all
alone
there.
i
didn’t
have
a
college
talking
about
my
decision?[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
the
legislature
had
required
them
to
take
a
choice
or
to
put
on
the
license
plate
on
van
or
bussing,
do
you
regard
that
as
somewhat
controversial,
wouldn’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
--
bussing
is
beautiful.
would
you
think
that
was
controversial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
difference
does
it
make
if
the
particular
person
finds
that
obnoxious
and
objectionable
or
whether
it’s
approved
by
a
majority
and
disapproved
by
only
a
small
minority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
jurisdictional
issue,
are
not
the
husband
and
the
wife
here
in
somewhat
different
positions?
the
husband
has
already
been
prosecuted
and
that
case
is
closed.
all
appeals
are
no
longer
available,
but
the
wife
has
never
been
prosecuted,
has
she?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
not
be
reasonable
for
her
to
assume
that
she
may
be
subject
to
the
same
kind
of
prosecution
as
her
husband?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
kohn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
state
compel
a
person
to
advertise
a
neutral
concept
that
did
not
offend
the
religion
clauses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
not
conceding
that
they’re
all
valid,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
still
wouldn’t
avoid
the
problem
under
the
power
of
the
state
to
compel
a
citizen
to
carry
picket
signs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
all
your
arguments
would
apply
with
equal
force
if
the
motto
on
a
license
plate
was
“don’t
litter”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
everyone
would
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
some
people
would
think
the
right
of
privacy
permits
any
person
to
throw
any
garbage
or
junk
anywhere
he
wants
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
the.
thank
you
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
johnson,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen.

case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
