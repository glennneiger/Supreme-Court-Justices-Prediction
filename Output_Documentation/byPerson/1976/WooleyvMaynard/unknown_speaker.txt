are
there
two
rather
separate
first
amendment
issues
here?
first,
the
one
that
you
summarized,
whether
or
not
this
was
affirmative
symbolic
expression
on
the
part
of
your
clients?
unknown
speaker
and
isn’t
the
second
issue,
whether
the
person
can
be
compelled
to
advertise
a
relief
in
which
she
does
not
believe.
unknown
speaker
are
they
not
rather
separable?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
third?
i
want
to
be
sure
about
it.
unknown
speaker
and
why?
