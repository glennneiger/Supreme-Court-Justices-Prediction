mrs.
cohen
before
you
sit
down
would
you
tell
me
because
i
am
little
lost
in
the
papers,
where
in
the
papers
your
understanding
of
the
correct
instruction
appears?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
reply
brief,
you
actually
set
out
an
instruction
you
think
it
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
ginsberg,
may
i
interrupt
for
a
moment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
should
that
affect
the
normal
rule
that
where
there
are
disputes
you
presume
the
jury
resolved
the
disputes
in
favor
of
the
bailing
side.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent’s
version
of
what
the
proper
instruction
would
have
been?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
which
is
a
stricter
standard,
foreseeability
or
recklessness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
specific
does
that
have
to
be
a
particular
truck
or
by
a
moving
vehicle
on
the
highway?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
any
argument
in
the
case
that
there
was
any
risk
of
death
other
than
by
vehicle?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
ginsberg,
can
i
ask
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
would
you
not
agree
that
we
must
accept
at
least
this
much
of
the
jury
verdict,
as
having
to
establish
that
the
defendant
had
the
requisite
intent
to
commit
the
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
recklessness,
it
requires
an
element
of
recklessness
as
tantamount
to
an
intent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
the
foreseeability?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
just
so
that
i
am
trying
to
understand
we
do
not
really
know
as
between
you
and
your
opponent
what
instruction
would
have
been
acceptable
to
both
of
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
do
we
know
in
the
papers
anywhere
what
precise
instruction
you
say
was
constitutional
error
for
the
judge
to
fail
to
give
on
his
own?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
if
in
giving
that
explanation
the
judge
had
made
a
comment
somewhat
comparable
to
the
last
clause,
the
one
here,
that
in
his
judgment
this
could
well
be
foreseeable
within
what
i
have
described
to
you
then
that
would
not
have
helped
you
very
much.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me
what
do
you
think
the
correct
instruction
would
have
been
right
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
ginsberg
let
me
just
follow
up
with
one
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
(inaudible),
and
you
do
not
think
it
is
conceivable
that
that
instruction
would
have
been
harmful
to
your
client’s
presentation
of
the
case,
because
is
not
that
rather
clear
that
it
was
foreseeable
that
a
truck
would
have
been
driving
down
this
highway
at
this
hour
of
the
night?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
put
it
somewhat
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
doesn't
that
same
point
go
to
whether
it
was
reckless
in
high
degree
of
death?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
you
are
assuming
that
there
had
to
be
a
truck
coming
on
at
the
very
moment
while
he
was
trying
to
run
across
the
road,
which
i
do
not
think
that
is
the...
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
not
agree
that
if
it
was
foreseeable,
the
thing
they
reasonably
expected
was
that
he
would
get
up
where
they
left
him
off,
and
walk
across
the
road
to
the
gas
station.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
it
is
cold,
if
he
just
has
to
walk
across
the
street
and
get
in
the
warm
gas
station?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
you
are
saying
that
it
is
conceivable
they
could
have
resolved
the
factual
issue
of
recklessness
one
way
and
the
factual
issue
of
foreseeability
another
way.
