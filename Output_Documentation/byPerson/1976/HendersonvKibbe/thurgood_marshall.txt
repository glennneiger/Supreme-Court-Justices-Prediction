justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
neither
raised
in
the
appellate
division
either?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
very
interested
in
the
awareness
of
a
drunken
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
see
several
people
walking
around
on
a
public
road
with
no
boots
and
pants
on,
is
that
normal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
contradiction
that
at
least
two
bars
interested
in
making
money
refused
to
serve
him
for
the
reason
that
he
was
drunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
consider
that
a
person
in
that
condition
is
“aware”.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
record
does
not
show
that;
it
said,
because
he
was
drunk.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
disputing
that
he
was
drunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
dispute
that
he
was
drunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
case
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
that
charge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
charge
in
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
seems
though
quite
a
few
of
us
are
interested
in
just
what
charge
--
i
understand
your
complaint
is
that
new
york,
under
its
law,
should
have
given
a
“charge”
and
we
have
got
everything
but
the
quote
and
end
quote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
the
end
of
burdens
run
all
the
way
up
to
the
appellate
division,
did
not
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
they
had
then
i
guess
this
point
never
would
have
gotten,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
if
we
had
left
it
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
he
never
would
have
released
it
to
the
respondent
to
the
respondent,
he
never
would
have
raised
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
though
he
was
drunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
record
shows
that
despite
what
you
said
the
expert
testified
that
is
that
to
indicate
a
high
degree
of
intoxication
25%.
