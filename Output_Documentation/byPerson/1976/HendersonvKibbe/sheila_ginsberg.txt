ms.
sheila
ginsberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
the
requirements
of
foreseeability
in
this
case
are
that
the
defendant
be
aware
of
the
risk
of
death
by
the
specific
agency
that
actually
inflicted
the
harm.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
it
was
a
narrow
roadway.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
your
honor
i
think
that
there
is
some
dispute
about
that.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
your
honor,
i
have
to
dispute
the
fact
that
stafford
did
not
have
his
pants
on.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
your
honor,
the
record
does
establish
that
but
the…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
it
depends
on
the
individual.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
but
the
record
also
shows
your
honor
that
the
medical
examiner...
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
excuse
me
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes,
your
honor,
i
will.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor
beyond
that…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
he
was
intoxicated,
yes.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
that
at
his
level
of
intoxication,
he
may
well
have
been
aware
and
the
defense
contended
he
was
of
this
avenue
of
safety.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
that
is
a
situation
in
which
the
jury
has
been
properly
and
adequately
instructed
on
the
elements
of
the
crime.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
certainly
that
foreseeability
is
one
of
the
essential
requirements
in
a
causation
instruction.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
foreseeability
is
a
much
stricter
standard.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
by
a
moving
vehicle
on
the
highway.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
exactly,
your
honor,
the
prosecution
contended
that
leaving
him
on
the
side
of
the
road
in
the
middle
of
the
winter,
exposed
him
to
the
risk
of
death
by
exposure.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
exactly,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
what
i
would
say
is
that
in
this
context
on
the
difficult
facts
of
this
case,
and
the
complex
in
intricate
problems
of
causation
presented
by
this
case.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
i
have
to
take
issue
with
that.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
they
did
affirm
the
conviction.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
a...
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
oh,
it
was
presented
to
the
state
courts
as
petitioner
conceived...
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes,
exactly
your
honor,
that
is
certainly
so.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
as
a
preliminary
matter
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
second
circuit
specifically
found
that
the
failure
to
object
in
this
case
was
an
inadvertent
failure
that
counsel
having
argued
as
he
did
prior
to
trial,
and
at
the
close
of
the
states
case
that
causation
had
not
been
established
to
you.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
your
honor,
i
was
not
of
course
trial
counsel
and
i
cannot
speak
from
personal
firsthand
knowledge,
but
i
would
say
that
it
was
just
inadvertence.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
what
i
would
have
to
say
in
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
in
fact
in
kibbe
itself
when
the
court
was
addressing
the
question
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
the
question
of
causation,
the
courts
specifically
held
that
it
was
critical
to
a
finding
of
causation
that
the
injury
to
stafford
be
foreseeable.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
your
honor,
not
in
this
proceeding,
we
do
not.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
this
particular
statute
under
new
york
law
does
not
as
the
second
circuit
noted
in
a
footnote,
required
intent.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
yes
but
as
i
pointed
out
recklessness
does
not
lead
to
standards
of…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
exactly.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
your
honor,
this
is
not
as
i
understand
is
the
charge
that
the
state
relies
on,
this
is
hypothetical
taken
from
lafave
&
scott
and
it
is
inapposite
to
the
fact
of
our
case.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no
it
does
not.
the
defense…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
we
did
not
draft
a
model
instruction,
but
it
was
our
position
that
the
instruction
had
to
include
within
it,
explanations
of
superseding
cause
independent
intervening
cause
in
that
regard...
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
you
may
not
find
if
i
can
phrase
it
in
the
negative
that
the
defendants
are
guilty
or
have
caused
stafford’s
death.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
for
what,
your
honor?
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
people
against
kane
cited
too
by
the
petitioners.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
i
do
not
know
that
the
kane
case
sets
forth
a
charge,
but
it
makes
clear
that
under
new
york
law
intervening
negligence.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
as
i
think
i
have
said
that
charge
must
include
directions
as
to
foreseeability
and
superseding
cause,
and
i
think
i
do
not
believe
that
anything
that
the
petitioners
have
said
here
this
morning
refutes
that.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
i
would
intend
or
have
to
conceive
that
a
request
would
have
been
helpful,
but
as
the
second
circuit
found
the
failure
to
request
was
inadvertent.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
again
i
cannot
speak
to
that,
but
i
would
point
out
as
it
is
been
pointed
out
to
me
the
appellate
division
did
consider
this
charge
on
the
merits.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
i
do
not
know
that
that
is
so.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
that
is
correct.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
as
i
know
that
your
honor
is
aware
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
the
second
circuit
found
and
we
assert
here
that
the
failure
to
explain
causation
precluded
the
jurors
from
finding
that
element
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
might
your
honor,
it
is
an
absolute
fact
or
a
certainty,
if
you
will,
uninstructed
it
was…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
but
the
instruction
given
or
the
example
given
by
the
prosecutor
was…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
judge's
failure
to
identify
causation
is
an
issue
or
to
specifically
direct
that
the
jury
find
causation,
communicated
to
the
jury
the
belief
that
causation
was
to
be
assumed.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
but
that
is
not
the
test,
and
that
is
tantamount
to
know
finding
of
causation
at
all.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
it
is
tantamount
on
these
facts
to
not
finding
causation
at
all
because…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
uninstructed
or
if
you
will
under
the
guidance
of
the
prosecutor,
the
jury...
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
with
the
caveat
that
that
is
not
what
happened
here,
that
the
judge
told
the
jurors
that
he
alone
would
instruct
on
the
law,
and
then
failed
to
tell
them
anything
about
causation.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
but
as
you
pointed
out
in
the
course
of
the
petitioner’s
argument
under
this
misconception
if
respondents
having
left
stafford
on
the
side
of
the
road
if
he
was
subsequently
hit
by
lightening
or
hit
by
a
crashing
plane
that
ironically
crossed
on
the
roadway
kibbe
would
be
guilty
of
murder.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
on
the
charge
that
was
given
in
this
case
i
would
say
yes.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
because
on
this
charge
the
jurors
could
not
have
found
causation
as
that…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
as
the
constitution
requires
that
each
element
of
the
crime
be
presented
to
the
jury
so
that
they
may
make
that
determination.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
the
simple
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
your
honor,
because
if
the
defense'
contentions
are
accepted,
all
that
stafford
had
to
do
when
he
was
let
out
of
the
car
was
to
quickly
cross
the
road
where
the
gas
station
was
there
to
offer
him
shelter.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor
as
i
said
earlier
recklessness
in
a
much
lesser
standard.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
recklessness
is
a
much
lesser
standard
because
it
requires
only...
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
recklessness
goes
to
several
of
the
fact
situations
or
fact
hypothesis
in
this
case,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
jury
might
well
have
found
recklessness
with
regard
to
the
weather
conditions
that
even...
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
that
may
well
be
your
honor,
but
that
was
a
question
of
fact
which
the
jury…
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
exactly.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
exactly,
and
it
was
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
determine.
