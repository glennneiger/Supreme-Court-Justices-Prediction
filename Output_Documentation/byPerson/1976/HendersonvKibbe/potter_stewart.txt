justice
potter
stewart
what
was
first
added
two
things.
i
did
not
understand
your
statement
of
facts.
what
advice
do
they
give
him?
justice
potter
stewart
what,
inside
his
clothing
or…
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
inside,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
the
gas
station
was,in
any
event,
on
the
other
side
of
the
road?
justice
potter
stewart
since
i
have
interrupted
you,
i
did
not
understand
you,
what
you
told
us
about
falling
into
a
snow
bank,
who
did
that?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
did
not
leave
the
road
very
far,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
into,
but
not
down
the
bank?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
has
anybody
observed?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this,
what
kind
of
a
road
was
this,
a
state
two-lane
road?
justice
potter
stewart
monroe
county?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
was
wondering
about
how
much
traffic
there
was
on?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
rush
hour
this
was
what
9
o’clock
at
night?
justice
potter
stewart
krall
was
not
a
party
to
this?
justice
potter
stewart
record
does
not
show?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
cohen,
was
there
any
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
immediate
cause
of
death
i.e.
the
being
struck
by
the
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
no
suggestion
that
he
died
from
poisoning
or
for
injuries
received
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
sole
immediate
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
nothing
very
new
about
that
idea.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
common
ground
between
you
and
your
adversary,
what
the
proper
instruction
would
have
been;
had
it
been
given?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
question
is,
is
it
clear
what
the
instruction
should
have
been;
had
it
been
given?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
not
in
your
view,
my
question
is,
is
it
clear;
is
new
york
clear
what
the
instruction
should
have
been
if
the
instruction
had
been
given?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
different
from
the
ordinary
concepts
of
approximate
cause
in
a
tort
case
in
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
is
not
negligence.
we
are
talking
about
approximate
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
have
to
find
that
what
they
did,
caused
his
death.
justice
potter
stewart
but
my
question
is,
is
cause
the
same,
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
the
same
as
concepts
of
approximate
cause
under
new
york
tort
law?
justice
potter
stewart
now
my
question
is
do
you
conceive
what
your
adversary
contents
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
fact
gave
an
erroneous
description
of
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
then
it
is
not
common
ground
as
to
what
the
instruction
should
have
been,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
relied
gadiel
(ph),
you
say,
yes
the
trial
judge
did
fail
to
give
any
instruction
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
'cause'
under
this
statute,
but
you
say
all
of
those
blanks
were
filled
in
by
argument
of
counsel,
and
among
other
things
the
prosecutor
argued
it
at
some
length,
but
your
adversary
says
but
he
gave
the
wrong
concept
of
cause,
he
gave
a
but-for.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
clear
about
your
answer
to
my
first
question
which
was,
is
it
clear
what
the
instruction
should
have
been
if
it
had
been
given?
and
if
it
is
clear
then
i
suppose
you
and
your
adversary
agree
on
what
it
would
have
been.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
is
not
clear,
i
suppose
you
to…
i
cannot
point
you
to
a
model
instruction
on
causation.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
but
here
there
was
no
instruction.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
new
york
courts
have
differed
with
you
on
that.
