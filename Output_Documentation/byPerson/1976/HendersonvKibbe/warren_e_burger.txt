chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
75-1906,
henderson
against
kibbe.
mrs.
cohen,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
get
this
in
setting
a
little
bit.
this
case
was
tried
in
the
new
york
state
courts
and
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
was
a
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
it
was
reviewed
by
the
appellate
division?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
affirmed
the
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
what
happened?
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
it
went
to
united
states
district
judge
on
habeas
corpus,
so
that
is
the
fourth
time
around.
and
he
said
the
trial
was
fair
and
there
was
no
problem
to
find
it
out
that
no
objection
had
been
made
at
the
trial
on
this
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
only
on
the
fifth
time
it
got
into
one
of
the
fifth
courts
of
the
judgment,
the
trial
court
was...
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
prosecutor
on
the
contrary
has
emphasized
to
the
great
extents,
the
conduct
in
leaving
the
man
out
on
the
road
and
accountability
that
he
would
be
exposed
to
great
danger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
up
to
1
oâ€™clock
mrs.
cohen.
mrs.
cohen
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
that
the
defense
carefully
and
studiously
avoided
the
request
for
instruction
on
causation
on
the
grounds
that
the
less
said
about
causation
the
better
it
would
be
for
the
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
your
sample
instruction
on
page
4
of
your
reply
brief
is
taken
verbatim
from
lafave
&
scott
or
have
you
adapted
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
not
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
it
is
not
foreseeable
that
some
automobiles
would
be
traveling
on
that
road?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
defendant
was
driving
a
car
there,
why
should
it
not
be
foreseeable
that
other
people
would
be
driving
there,
when
the
road
is
provided
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
perhaps
because
they
did
not
think
it
was
a
significant
issue
at
all
at
that
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
question
i
put
to
your
friend
or
the
state
that
any
additional,
any
clarification
that
was
subject
to
causation
was
carefully
avoided
by
the
defense,
because
the
less
said
about
causation
the
better
for
the
defense,
is
that
a
tactic
of
the
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
is
there
in
this
record
that
will
suggest
or
support
your
answer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
explanations
have
you
for
the
defense
not
requesting
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
having
discussed
the
subject
as
much
as
it
was
discussed
and
having
contemplated
it
enough
to
talk
about
it
in
extents
so
in
the
closing
arguments,
isn't
it
remarkable
to
suggest
that
that
is
an
inadvertent
oversight?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
this
bring
us
around
if
not
full
circle
or
close
to
the
staring
point
that
this
is
why
objections
are
called
for
in
the
trial
of
a
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
ms.
ginsberg.
