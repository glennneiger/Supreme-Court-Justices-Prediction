unknown
speaker
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
or
with
the
same
issue
being
here
or
any
other
if
the
gentleman
had
been
abandoned
with
his
clothes
on
at
the
same
spot,
and
he
had
managed
to
crawl
to
the
fueling
station,
and
then
he
was
murdered
inside
the
filling
station
by
some
friends?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
you
had
never
prosecuted
them,
but
assume
you
had,
would
this
kind
of
an
instruction
had
been
adequate
to
pose
the
question?
unknown
speaker
he
never
found
safety
apparently
as
soon
as
he
got
to
the
filling
station
he
was
killed
by
somebody
else.
now
is
that
--
of
course
he
never
would
have
been
out
there,
he
never
would
have
had
to
go
to
and
got
in
the
filling
station
except
for
the
fact
that
these
people
abandoned
him
there.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
what
the
instructions
said,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
they
said,
it
makes
him
cause
alright,
but
did
not
talk
about
foreseeability.
are
you
now
suggesting
that
perhaps
the
issue
really
was
foreseeability
or…
unknown
speaker
well
then
how
the
jury
know
that
the
issue
was
foreseeability?
unknown
speaker
then
the
judge
says
do
not
listen
to
them,
i
will
give
you
the
law.
unknown
speaker
the
issue
would
be
the
same
here
if
he
had
been
struck
by
lightening
on
wrong
side
of
the
road.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
the
instruction
that
was
given
to
them
would
not
distinguish
between
any
of
the
three
cases;
the
actual
case,
the
filling
station
case
or
the
lightening
case?
unknown
speaker
did
this
judge
give
the
usually
or
at
least
frequently
given
charge
that
you
are
to
evaluate
things
in
the
light
of
ordinary
human
experience?
unknown
speaker
on
the
other
hand…
unknown
speaker
would
you
defend
that
instruction
if
the
instruction
had
said
and
now
i
want
to
define
causation
for
you.
unknown
speaker
what
provision
of
constitution
would
that
offend?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
what
i
asked
you
which
is
--
is
it
an
constitutional
instruction?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
understand
your
opponents
do
or
the
court
below
do
held
that
the
constitutional
infirmity
was
in
the
instruction?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
what
is
in
some
constitutional
rationale
based
on
lack
of
fault
or
lack
of
intent
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
i
used
this
as…
unknown
speaker
mrs.
cohen,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
you
this,
but
i
did
not
hear
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
when
you
do
it,
maybe
he
was
drunk.
unknown
speaker
and
the
difference
is?
unknown
speaker
sure,
by
freezing
exposure
to
freezing.
unknown
speaker
well,
with
all
respect
to
you
and
to
my
colleagues
we
are
not
here
trying
the
innocence
or
guilt
of
this
person
or
trying
to
evaluate
the
merits
of
this
lawsuit,
but
simply
to
determine
whether
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
in
holding
that
it
was
a
constitutional
violation
for
the
trial
judge
not
to
specifically
instruct
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
‘cause’
under
the
new
york
statute.
unknown
speaker
certainly
there
can
be
no
serious
claim
that
the
jury
did
not
find
every
element
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
because
they
were
instructed
correctly
as
to
the
burden
of
proof
of
the
prosecution
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
they
were
given
this
statute
in
(inaudible)
which
uses
the
word
‘cause’
and
so
there
can
be
no
serious
question
of
what
the
jury
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
your
client
caused
this
person’s
death.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law,
you
are
mistaking,
aren't
you?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
matter
of
new
york
law.
unknown
speaker
they
affirmed
the
conviction,
did
not
they?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
have
either
presented
the
issue
to
the
state
courts
and
had
it
rejected
or
you
have
not
exhausted
your
state
remedy
yet.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
then
it
has
been
rejected
by
the
state
courts,
and
that
is
enough
to
let
you
in
the
federal
court,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
locate
in
the
constitution
this
requirement
to
give
a
foreseeability
instruction?
unknown
speaker
not
because
my
brother
stewart
said
the
jury
did
not
find
cause
in
finding
a
guilty,
that
he
must
have,
he
said
really
now
you
must
find
causation
and
the
jury
finds
him
guilty,
so
they
found
causation.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
you
would
still
be
with
us
on
the
same
ground,
and
i
am
sure
you
would.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
judge
said
you
must
find
causation,
and
they
found
causation.
unknown
speaker
it
was
instructed
in
my
example
on
causation,
and
so
was
this
jury
on
causation.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
jury
were
just
left
for
you
to
find
causation
the
way
i
guess
they
decided
what
causation
meant,
and
where
do
they
found
it.
unknown
speaker
the
jury
must
have
agreed
with
them,
they
at
least
found
but-for
cause.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
see
where
you
get
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
keep
saying
that,
but
i
am
not
sure
i
will
ever
believe
it,
now
also
you
said.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
see
that
--
let
us
assume
the
judge
had
been
instructed
on
but-for
cause
and
said
look
jury,
here
is
what
i
mean
by
cause,
it
means
but-for,
that
is
all
and
then
explain
what
but-for
was,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
if
they
had
not
left
him
by
the
road
he
probably
would
not
have
been
runover?
unknown
speaker
alright,
and
would
you
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
for
what
reason?
unknown
speaker
as
the
constitution
requires
causation
to
be
defined.
