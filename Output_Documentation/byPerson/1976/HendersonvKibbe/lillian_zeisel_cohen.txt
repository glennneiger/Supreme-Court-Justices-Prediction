ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
state
court
criminal
conviction
should
be
set
aside
as
fundamentally
unfair,
because
the
trial
judge
did
not
explain
the
issue
of
causation
to
the
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative
“on
the
limited
and
singular
facts
of
this
case”.
the
court
held
that
in
this
case
the
jury
may
not
have
been
aware
that
they
had
to
decide
the
issue
of
causation
and
alternatively
that
if
the
jury
was
aware
of
this
element
the
instruction
was
not
detailed
enough.
petitioner
believes
that
the
decision
below
is
erroneous.
first,
because
the
issue
of
causation
was
focused
for
the
jury
throughout
the
trial
by
the
prosecution
and
by
both
defense
lawyers.
second,
because
the
record
controverts
respondent’s
assumption
that
it
would
have
been
to
his
advantage
to
if
had
a
detailed
instruction
on
the
issue
of
causation,
and
third,
because
the
ultimate
question
that
was
decided
by
the
court
below
and
upon
which
its
decision
rests
to
wit
whether
the
jury
instruction
was
adequate
was
essentially
a
question
of
state
law
and
not
a
matter
for
habeas
corpus
review.
respondent
and
his
codefendant
were
convicted
of
the
crime
of
murder
in
the
second
degree
under
a
section
of
the
new
york
penal
law,
which
provides
that
a
person
is
guilty
of
murder
when
under
circumstances
evincing
a
depraved
indifference
to
human
life.
he
recklessly
engages
in
conduct
which
creates
a
grave
risk
of
death
to
another
person
and
thereby
causes
the
death
of
another
person.
a
defendant
is
reckless
under
new
york
law
when
he
is
aware
of
and
consciously
disregards
a
substantial
and
unjustifiable
risk
that
a
particular
result
will
occur.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
essentially
undisputed.
on
december
30,
1970
in
the
evening
respondent
kibbe
and
his
codefendant
roy
krall
met
a
man
named
george
stafford
in
a
bar
in
rochester,
new
york.
at
that
point,
stafford
had
already
been
refused
service
in
the
bar,
because
he
had
had
so
much
to
drink.
kibbe
and
krall
agreed
to
give
stafford
a
ride
home
when
stafford
indicated
that
he
was
afraid
to
drive
his
own
car.
the
defendants
later
admitted
that
they
had
already
formed
the
intent
to
take
the
money,
which
stafford
had
been
flashing
in
the
bar.
first
however,
the
three
men
went
to
two
more
bars,
one
of
which
refused
stafford
service
again.
kibbe
and
krall
then
drove
stafford
to
a
rural
area
outside
of
rochester.
they
took
his
money.
according
to
the
defendants,
stafford
lowered
his
trousers
and
took
off
his
boots
to
show
them
that
he
had
no
more
money.
stafford’s
girlfriend
testified
at
the
trial
however
that
in
fact
because
of
an
injury
to
his
leg
he
could
not
remove
his
right
boot.
however,
stafford’s
state
of
undress
is
accounted
for.
the
fact
is
that
he
was
left
essentially
undressed
at
the
side
of
a
two-lane
unlit
road,
which
was
banked
on
both
sides
by
snow.
the
record
establishes
that
it
was
four
degrees
outside.
stafford
was
not
wearing
his
jacket
or
his
boots.
these
were
handed
to
him
by
respondent
kibbe
with
the
advice
that
stafford
get
inside
so
that
he
not
freeze
to
death.
one
essential
fact
remains,
and
that
is
that
at
this
point
kibbe
and
krall
drove
off
leaving
stafford
on
the
side
of
the
road
having
fallen
into
a
snow
bank,
and
they
took
with
them
his
eyeglasses.
now
there
is
no
dispute.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
they
advised
him
to
get
inside
so
that
he
would
not
freeze
to
death.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
they
advised
him
to
get
inside
somewhere,
they
did
not…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
this
is
the
point.
it
is
undisputed
that
there
was
an
open
gas
station
in
the
area.
krall
in
the
statement
he
later
gave
to
the
police
said
that
they
left
stafford
75
feet
away
from
this
gas
station.
the
prosecution
introduced
physical
evidence
to
show
that
in
fact
stafford
had
been
left
a
quarter
mile
away
from
the
gas
station.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
that
is
the
critical
point.
and
not
only
was
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
but
kibbe
and
krall
both
acknowledged
that
they
knew
this.
so,
when
they
told
him
to
get
inside
some
place,
and
they
knew
that
the
gas
station
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
road,
they
realized
he
had
to
cross
the
road.
moreover,
krall
acknowledged,
at
least
krall
acknowledged
that
there
was
in
fact
at
that
time
on
the
road
traffic
going
in
both
directions.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
stafford,
when
he
left
the
car,
fell
into
a
snow
bank
of
which
i
think
is
some
indication
of
the
drunken
condition
in
which
he
was.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
apparently
he
could
not
leave
the
road
very
far,
because
it
was
snow
banks
on
both
sides
of
the
road.
he
apparently
fell
into
the
snow
that
is
on
the
side
of
the
road.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
not
at
all.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
there
is
no
intimation
of
that
in
the
record.
half
an
hour
later…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
i
gather
it
is
a
county
road.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
yes,
and
the
main
feature
from
our
standpoint
that
is
relevant
is,
that
it
was
a
two-lane
highway
and
that
there
was
no
artificial
lighting
over
here.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
there
is
testimony
on
traffic,
although
respondent
disputes
the
amount
of
traffic.
as
i
say,
krall
himself
admitted
that
there
were
cars
going
in
both
directions
at
the
time
that
they
abandoned
stafford.
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
which
took
place
a
half
an
hour
later
at
least
three
cars
converged
on
that
point.
and
as
we
point
out
in
the
reply
brief,
the
driver
of
the
car
which
ultimately
struck
stafford
indicated
that
passersby
as
they
came
along
after
the
accident
stopped
to
give
him
assistance,
so
that
there
may
not
have
been
heavy
rush
hour
traffic,
which
might
exist
in
a
major
city.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
this
was
09:30
in
the
evening,
so
that
it
may
not
have
been
a
rush
hour,
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
not
in
the
early
morning
hours
when
you
would
expect
there
would
be
very
little
traffic
on
the
road.
but
there
is
affirmative
evidence,
the
cars
were
passing
on
the
road
and
there
is
the
admission
by
krall
himself
that
there
were
cars
going
in
both
directions
when
they
did
abandon
him
at
the
side
of
the
road.
half
an
hour…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
apparently
he
filed
the
petition
jointly
when
this
first
begun,
but
i
do
not
know
that
he
apparently
withdrew.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
i
am
afraid,
but
he
did
not
pursue
it
to
the
second
circuit.
half
an
hour
later
after
he
was
abandoned,
stafford
was
struck
by
a
light
pickup
truck
going
10
miles
over
the
speed
limit.
the
accident
occurred
one
quarter
mile
away
from
the
gas
station.
stafford
at
the
time
of
the
accident
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
lane
on
the
same
side
of
the
highway
as
he
had
been
abandoned.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
yes.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
they
did.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
then
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
i
think
ultimately
what
is
critical
is
that
he
looked
at
the
alleged
error
in
this
case,
and
he
felt
that
it
was
not
a
substantial
violation
and
that
he
was
simply
being
called
upon
to
review
jury
instructions
that
that
was
not
the
province
of
habeas
corpus
review.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
must
set
aside,
and
i
might
add
with
one
dissent
that
it
was
not
unanimous
decision
by
the
second
circuit.
now,
from
the
beginning
of
this
trial
the
two
lawyers
representing
kibbe
and
krall
attempted
to
shift
the
responsibility
for
what
happened
to
the
driver
of
the
truck,
michael
blake.
they
did
this
in
several
ways.
first,
they
cross-examined
michael
blake
extensively
about
the
circumstances
under
which
he
struck
stafford.
they
cross-examined
the
medical
examiner
to
show
that
there
was
no
chance
that
death
was
caused
by
anything
except
the
impact
from
the
truck,
and
they
also
argued
this
in
summation,
and
they
argued
it
very
graphically,
and
i
think
very
emotionally.
krall’s
attorney
actually
said
to
the
jury
that
if
anyone
in
this
case
was
depraved,
and
if
anyone
in
this
case
caused
stafford’s
death,
it
was
michael
blake,
and
interestingly,
the
officials
had
taken
no
action
against
him
for
his
wrongdoing.
at
the
same
time
they
both
pointedly
disputed
the
forseeability
of
stafford’s
death.
how
they
argued?
could
kibbe
and
krall
have
foreseen
when
they
left
this
man
by
the
side
of
the
road
that
along
with
come
this
pickup
truck,
driving
10
miles
over
the
hour
and
that
the
driver
would
not
swerve
or
brake?
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
that
was
firmly
established.
the
injuries
refer
that…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
nothing
extraneous,
no.
it
was
clearly
established
that
it
was
the
impact
of
the
truck
and
that
was…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
the
sole
immediate
cause
of
death.
now,
in
short
as
the
court
below
itself
found
the
issue
of
causation
was
constantly
being
placed
before
the
jury
by
the
defense,
and
i
might
add
the
prosecutor
responded
in
kind
arguing
that
even
though
these
defendants
were
not
the
sole
cause
of
death,
even
though
they
were
not
the
immediate
cause
of
death,
nevertheless
they
were
responsible,
and
they
were
approximate
cause
of
death.
now,
not
withstanding,
the
fact
that
the
theory
of
the
defense
was
to
deny
that
kibbe
and
krall
had
caused
death.
neither
defense
lawyer
objected
when
the
trial
judge
did
not
define
the
element
of
causation
for
the
jury.
we
believe
there
are
two…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
they
did
not,
and
it
was
the
same
lawyer
at
least
representing
respondent
kibbe
who
represented
him
on
this
direct
appeal.
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
appellate
division
by
the
dissenting
judge,
and
it
was
answered
by
the
majority
there,
who
believed
that
he
was
not
deprived
of
the
fair
trial.
it
was
first
explicitly
raised
in
behalf
of
these
two
defendants
when
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals.
so
that
they
did
not
take
an
objection
at
the
time
of
the
charge
and
as
i
indicated
we
believe
there
are
two
possible
explanations
for
their
decision.
the
first
is
that
they
were
satisfied
that
the
issue
of
causation
had
been
focused
for
the
jury.
the
second
is
that
they
realized
that
under
new
york
law,
an
explicit
charge
on
causation
would
have
effectively
deprived
them
of
the
opportunity
of
arguing
to
the
jury
that
it
was
the
negligence
of
the
driver
that
was
to
blame,
and
in
that
way
attempting
to
sway
the
jury
away
from
the
responsibility
of
the
defendants.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
all
of
the
arguments
in
this
case
are
very
emotional
in
that
sense.
the
facts
are
really
very
dramatic.
they
are
very
unusual,
but
they
are
very
dramatic.
the
picture
of
this
very
helpless
man
in
the
state
of
undress
left
in
the
freezing
weather
on
the
wrong
side
of
road
without
his
glasses.
this
was
hammered
out
constantly,
and
that
was
hammered
up
by
the
prosecution
to
show
responsibility,
and
it
was
disputed
by
the
defense
who
said
it
simply
was
not
foreseeable.
with
respect
to
counsel’s
likely
satisfaction
that
the
issue
was
properly
before
the
jury,
i
point
to
the
statement
by
counsel
for
krall
who
even
before
the
charge
to
the
jury
said
in
summation,
“you
probably
have
the
accounts
well
in
mind
since
we
have
all
gone
over
it.”
now
at
that
point,
in
the
trial,
the
indictment
had
been
read
to
the
jury
by
kibbe’s
counsel
in
summation.
it
had
been
outlined
by
the
district
attorney
in
his
opening.
the
record
indicates
that
it
was
read
to
the
jury
during
the
voir
dire
as
each
new
panel
was
brought
in.
thereafter,
krall’s
attorney
proceeded
to
read
the
indictment
to
the
jury,
and
the
judge
at
the
beginning
of
his
charge
read
the
indictment
to
the
jury.
the
judge
also
read
the
provisions
of
the
statute
after
emphasizing
that
every
element
of
the
crime
had
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
ultimately
while
the
jury
was
deliberating
the
indictment
was
given
to
them
so
that
they
could
track
the
charges.
despite
these
repeated
statements
of
the
law
to
the
jury
and
despite
the
fact
the
causation
was
argued
so
graphically
to
the
jury
by
both
defense
counsels,
the
court
below
questioned
whether
the
jury
was
aware
that
it
had
to
decide
the
issue
of
causation.
this
conclusion
in
my
opinion
cannot
be
sustained
on
the
record
in
this
case,
and
we
believe
that
the
explanation
for
the
court's
speculation
that
the
jury
may
not
have
been
aware
of
this
issue,
which
was
the
focus
of
the
trial
was
it
is
failure
to
make
an
analysis
of
this
trial
as
mandated
by
this
court
in
cupp
against
naughten.
in
cupp,
this
court
specifically
reaffirmed
what
it
called
a
fundamental
principle
that
a
single
jury
instruction
may
not
be
evaluated
only
in
the
context
of
the
overall
charge,
but
in
the
context
of
the
entire
trial.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
the
court
used
the
words,
"fundamental
principle",
it
took
it
as
a
given,
and
in
doing
so
emphasized
the
relevance
of
the
witness’s
testimony
and
the
relevance
of
the
arguments
of
counsel.
in
the
instant
case,
and
so
far
as
this
court
below
acknowledged
these
factors,
they
did
it
in
a
footnote
considering
the
fact
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
alternate
holding
in
the
case,
and
they
discounted
them
in
much
the
same
way
that
they
discounted
the
relevance
of
reading
the
statute
and
reading
the
indictment
to
the
jury,
that
is,
they
lifted
each
of
these
factors
out
of
the
context
of
the
trial,
and
they
examined
them
one
by
one,
and
they
rejected
them,
instead
of
making
the
overall
evaluation,
which
cupp
requires
of
whether
or
not
the
trial
as
a
whole
was
fundamentally
fair.
now,
respondent
attempts
to
distinguish
cupp
on
the
grounds
that
the
alleged
error
there
was
corrected
within
the
confines
of
the
charge
itself,
and
there
was
no
recourse
to
the
other
events
of
the
trial.
to
me,
this
argument
highlights
the
real
distinction
between
cupp
and
this
case.
cupp
involved
a
challenge
to
an
affirmative
instruction
to
the
jury.
the
jury
was
told
there
that
it
should
find
that
the
prosecution’s
witnesses
had
told
the
truth
unless
the
presumption
of
truthfulness
was
overcome.
therefore
in
cupp
it
became
necessary
to
determine
whether
anything
in
the
remainder
of
the
charge
offset
the
impact
on
the
minds
of
the
jury
of
that
directive
by
the
trial
judge.
the
instein
(ph)
case
is
quite
different.
the
charge
to
the
jury
in
the
instein
(ph)
case
was
perfectly
adequate
as
far
as
it
went,
and
in
fact
the
court
below
characterized
much
of
the
charge
scrupulous.
we
believe
that
because
the
trial
judge
did
not
affirmatively
mislead
the
jury,
did
not
affirmatively
say
anything
to
them,
which
had
to
be
erased
from
their
minds.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess
i
was
addressing
respondent’s
contention
that
cupp
against
naughten
was
simply
a
case
involving
a
self-correcting
instruction.
petitioner
believes
that
this
argument
ignores
the
analysis
that
was
endorsed
by
the
court
in
cupp
without
i
might
add
denying
its
validity.
in
fact
because
cupp
involved
a
challenge
to
an
affirmative
instruction
to
the
jury
whereas
this
case
involves
an
omission,
resort
to
what
happened
during
the
remainder
of
the
trial
becomes
even
more
germane.
because
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
did
not
affirmatively
misadvised
the
jury
or
mislead
the
jury,
there
was
nothing
which
had
to
be
erased
from
the
minds
of
the
jurors
or
as
respondent
says,
neutralized.
there
was
no
infection
of
the
rest
of
the
trial.
the
rest
of
the
trial
was
perfectly
adequate.
therefore,
the
question
is
simply,
whether
the
record
as
a
whole
shows
that
the
gap
in
the
charge
was
effectively
filled
by
the
events
at
trial,
an
approach
which
is
consistent
not
only
with
cupp
but
which
is
consistent
with
the
approach
used
in
all
habeas
corpus
review.
in
addition
to
its
failure
to
properly
apply
cupp
the
circuit
court
in
its
evaluation
of
this
state
court
instruction
also
failed
to
credit
factors
upon
which
it
has
relied
in
its
own
cases
to
sustain
its
own
federal
convictions.
in
a
series
of
cases
of
which
the
best
example
is
united
states
against
papa,
in
533
f.2d.
the
court
below,
sustained
federal
narcotics
conspiracy
convictions
despite
the
failure
in
each
of
those
cases,
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
to
charge
the
element
of
knowledge
to
the
jury.
in
each
instance,
the
circuit
court
determined
that
the
jury
was
aware
of
the
missing
element,
because
the
district
judge
had
read
to
the
jury
both
the
statute
and
the
indictment.
in
papa
it
was
done
repeatedly
as
it
was
done
in
this
case.
it
is
clear
therefore
that
by
refusing
to
give
due
weight
to
the
same
factors
that
it
has
relied
upon
in
reviewing
its
own
convictions,
the
court
below
was
effectively
holding
this
state
court
trial
judge
to
a
higher
standard
than
it
has
held
its
own
district
judges.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
again
there
presupposes
--
there
are
certain
facts...
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
new
york
law,
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
determine,
has
no
standard
or
evaluation
of
contributory
negligence,
and
certainly
does
not
seem
to
follow
the
decision
cited
by
the
respondent,
the
north
carolina
decision
which
is
to
the
effect
that
if
the
victim
has
found
safety,
and
then
for
reasons
of
his
own,
abandons
it,
and
is
then
injured
or
killed,
that
is
not
foreseeable.
new
york
does
not
seem
to
have
a...
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
the
question
ultimately
would
have
been
the
same
question
it
is
in
this
case,
and
that
is
was
it
foreseeable
that
when
they
left
this
man
at
the
side
of
the
road
he
would
then
be
killed
for
example...
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
the
instructions
to
the
jury
in
this
case
said...
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
the
issue
was
foreseeability
throughout
the
trial.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
they
knew
that
the
issue
was
foreseeability,
because
it
was
argued
to
them
effectively
by
all
three
lawyers
in
this
case,
the
prosecution,
and
the
two
defense
lawyers.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
on
the
contrary
the
judge
said
to
them
very
explicitly,
so
long
as
you
find
the
basis
for
counsel’s
arguments
in
the
evidence
you
may
follow
counsel’s
arguments
in
reaching
your
conclusion,
and
i
do
not
believe
even
in
the
decisions
of
the
circuit
court
reviewing
its
own
convictions
it
has
concluded
that
a
single
statement
by
the
judge
that
i
am
the
source
of
the
law
effectively
wipes
out
the
impact
of
the
other
arguments
that
it
has.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
the
issue
would
have
been
foreseeability,
the
difference
would
have
been
that
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law,
i
would
suggest
that
that
would
have
been
an
intervening,
a
superseding
cause,
and
there
might
have
been
a
different
case
in
that
case.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
yes,
but
on
the
other
hand
we
are
simply
dealing
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
it
is
our
argument
in
this
case
that
had
there
been
an
explicit
instruction
to
the
jury
in
this
case
unforeseeability,
the
result
would
have
been
that
the
defense
would
not
have
had
available
to
it
the
negligence
that
was
involved
in
this
case,
in
argument
to
the
jury
that
the
defendants
were
not
responsible.
i
think
we
have
to
sort
of
focus
on
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
all
kinds
of
hypothetical
happenings,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
this
case
there
was
simply
a
negligent
driver
who
came
along
the
road.
under
new
york
law,
this
would
have
been
regarded
as
within
the
foreseeable
consequences
of
leaving
this
man
by
the
side
of
the
road
in
a
helpless
condition.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
he
had
certainly
instructed
them
on
the
need
to
prove
things
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
indicated
to
them
what
a
reasonable
doubt
might
be.
i
do
not
recall
that
he
specifically
said
that
you
may
rely
in
your
commonsense.
on
the
other
hand,
that
was
specifically
argued
to
the
jury
by
the
district
attorney.
as
a
matter
of
commonsense,
when
you
look
at
what
happened
in
this
case
it
must
be
self-evident
that
these
men
leaving
this
victim
by
the
side
of
the
road
in
his
condition
would
have
foreseen
as
reasonable
man
that
this
was
a
consequence
of
their
actions.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
your
honor,
until
our
reply
brief
there
was
never
any
discussion
of
what
new
york
law
was,
and
that
is
one
of
the
problems
that
we
have
with
the
opinion
below.
it
was
not
argued
to
the
circuit
court.
the
circuit
court
in
concluding
that
an
instruction
on
causation
might
have
been
helpful
never
had
recourse
to
new
york
law.
instead
it
discussed
the
various
decisions
from
other
jurisdictions
many
of
them
very
old.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
in
our
view
the
instruction
and
the…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
i
think
yes,
and
certainly
the
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
particular
case
reaffirms
that
the
instruction
in
this
case
would
have
been
that
now
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
not
the
sole
or
the
immediate
cause
if
it
was
foreseeable
that
their
conduct
would
have
resulted
in
the
death
by
vehicle
of
this
victim
then
you
may
convict
him,
you
may
convict
them.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
different
in
the
sense
of
the
standard.
it
is
still
a
reasonable
man
standard,
but
it
is
just
that
there
is
a
different
degree
of
negligence
that
is
required.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
in
this
case
these
defendants
were
held
to
recklessness.
the
charge
from
the
jury
was
that
you
had
to
find
that
these
men
were
aware
of
and
consciously
disregarded
a
substantial
risk.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
that
is
right.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
in
the
analysis,
i
would
say
yes,
but
in
terms
of
the
degree
of
culpability
required,
no.
in
kibbe...
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
not
at
all.
we
dispute
that
in
the
teply
brief.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
well,
no,
i
beg
to
differ
on
that
because
the
respondent
has
never
argued
this
case
in
terms
of
what
the
new
york
law
was.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
under
new
york
laws
we
point
out
in
the
reply
brief,
but-for
certainly
enters
into
the
consideration
in
this
case
and
in
every
case
where
causation
is
involved.
it
is
not
the
sole
element
that
maybe
considered,
and
it
was
not…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
did
in
this
case.
he
did
discuss
the
but-for
element
and
the
respondent
has
conceded
that
that
is
a
relevant
element,
but
he
did
do
it
in
the
context
of
an
argument,
which
was
essentially
a
foreseeability
argument.
in
other
words,
we
believe
that
respondent
essentially
lifted
that
but-for
statement
out
of
the
context
of
the
entire
trial,
not
simply
out
of
the
context
of
the
summation
of
district
attorney.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
i
can
only
point
you
to
the
new
york
decisions,
which
have
dealt
with
the
question
of
causation,
and
from
those
i
have
submitted
to
the
court
what
i
believe
a
correct
instruction
would
have
been.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
these
instructions
which
we
have
submitted
to
this
court
in
our
reply
brief
is
the
appropriate
instruction.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
there
was
no
instruction
in
this
case.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
there
was
none
asked
for,
and
interestingly
counsel
did
make
requests
to
the
court
for
certain
instructions
relating
to
this
particular
statute,
but
not
relating
to
the
element
of
causation.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
if
that
were
the
sole
instruction
on
causation
that
would
not
be
an
adequate
for
instruction.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
i
do
not
think
it
would
offend
any.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
i
do
not
say
that
what
happened
here
or
the
hypothetical
that
you
posed
to
me
raises
a
question
of
constitutional
law,
that
is
where
we
ultimately
take
issue
with
what
the
court
did
below,
because
in
essence
the
court
below...
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
the
court
below
seems
to
say
that
because
there
are
some
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
jury
was
aware
of
the
element
of
causation,
there
was
no
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
causation.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
however,
the
court
below
does
not
state
that
across
the
board,
they
certainly
do
not
cite
any
authority
to
support
what
is
essentially
a
pro
se
argument.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
i
do
not
understand
them
to
be
reaching
out
to
decide
a
broad
constitutional
principle
on
this
case.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
this
is
the
thrust
of
our
reply
brief,
because
although
the
law
in
new
york,
prior
to
the
kibbe
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
sparse.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
we
addressed
this
in
our
reply
brief.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
which
i
believe
they
would
have
been
entitled
to,
and
which
we
believe
would
have
precluded
the
defense
in
this
case
from
using
the
emotional
argument
to
the
jury
that
it
was
blake’s
fault,
and
that
he
was
the
one
who
was
responsible.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
the
discussion
of
lafave
&
scott
on
our
part
i
think
is
gratuitous
and
was
simply
engaged
in
for
purposes
of
showing
that…
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
no,
the
hypothetical
is
verbatim
from
lafave
&
scott.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
as
hornbook
law
they
regard
what
happened
in
this
case
as
wholly
foreseeable.
ms.
lillian
zeisel
cohen
yes,
he
was
convicted.
