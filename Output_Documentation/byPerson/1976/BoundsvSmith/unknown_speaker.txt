unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
you
might
point
out
that
judge
harmsworth
(ph)
who
has
sat
on
this
panel
did
he
not?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
member
of
the
judicial
conference
that
prepared
these
rules.
unknown
speaker
general
safron,
in
the
response
you
have
made
the
other
day
to
the
habeas
corpus
petition,
did
you
cite
any
cases?
unknown
speaker
the
one
you
said
you
responded
to
one
of
these
forms.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
one
you
responded
to
these,
did
you
sometimes
cite
cases?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
point
you
are
making
about
the
fact
that
the
initial
filing
does
not
require
any
citation
of
cases,
what
do
you
develop
from
that
point?
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
the
initial
filing?
unknown
speaker
and
most
litigation
involves
more
than
one
filing.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
johnson
v.
avery?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
to
refile
that?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
nothing
in
johnson
v.
avery
suggested
that
the
prisoners’
resources
have
to
be
equal
to
that
of
the
state.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
is
it
the
position
of
north
carolina
that
no
library
need
to
be
provided.
unknown
speaker
no
library
facilities
at
all,
no
access,
for
example,
to
the
slip
opinions
on
the
decisions
of
this
court,
if
that
is
right?
unknown
speaker
now
let
me
follow
that
up
just
a
bit.
you
emphasized
that
forms
and
i
understand
why
you
do
i
think
they
are
said
that
you
are
not
irrelevant,
but
is
it
not
possible
that
inmates
may
need
access
to
the
opinions
of
this
court,
for
example,
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
consider
filing
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
or
a
civil
rights
action.
unknown
speaker
consequences
where
it
is
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
get
back
to
your
basis.
are
you
taking
this
position
on
the
theory
that
the
law
library
would
be
useless?
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
of
north
carolina
make
an
application
for
an
leaa
grant
for
a
library?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
safron,
the
answer
that
you
suggested
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
back
to
my
question
that
you
did
file
an
leaa
grant?
unknown
speaker
did
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
that
application
state
that
a
prison
library
would
be
useful?
unknown
speaker
the
answer
is
yes?
unknown
speaker
or
it
does
get
to
your
statement
that
the
libraries
would
be
useless?
unknown
speaker
just
before
you
proceed
to
that
--
what
would
be
the
mechanics
that
he
is
getting
counsel
in
your
state
system?
he
files
rights
out
in
prison,
let
us
say,
without
the
help
of
any
professional
help
or
any
book
help,
and
he
files
a
collateral
complaint
or
some
kind
in
your
state
court.
it
is
denied.
now,
how
does
he
or
anybody
else
know
that
it
has
been
denied,
how
does
he
go
about
getting
counsel
to
appeal
that?
unknown
speaker
he
does
then
have
our
states
statutory
right
to
counsel
to
represent
him
at
the
original
hearing
on
the
collateral
attack,
doesn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
does
he
or
doesn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
in
that
merit,
if
the
petition
makes
out
a
plausible
case?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
court
finds
no
merit
and
therefore
does
not
appoint
counsel
and
further
therefore
denies
the
writ,
he
still
has
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
to
deal
with
that.
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
he
get
a
copy
of
the
order
of
denial?
unknown
speaker
right,
or
at
either
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
federal
court
may
have
to
go
step
two
if
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
its
state
policies,
said
we
are
going
to
provide
adequate
law
libraries
to
everybody
in
custody
in
our
prison
system,
and
then
proceeded
to
supply
adequate
law
libraries
to
only
one
institution
but
not
to
any
of
the
others,
then
the
prisoners
in
those
other
institutions
would
have
an
equal
protection
plan,
wouldn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
it
happens
at
the
county
a
way
out
in
the
woods,
where
the
inmate
does
not
have
a
library
and
the
judge
does
not
have
a
library
and
the
state’s
attorney
does
not
have
a
library.
unknown
speaker
no,
this
is
the
way
out.
unknown
speaker
so,
if
you
are
out
--
(inaudible)
asheville
out
there
and
you
come
all
the
way,
you
need
to
run.
unknown
speaker
who
is
they?
unknown
speaker
but,
not
the
convicts?
unknown
speaker
does
convict
call,
so?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
possibly
your
argument
suggest
that
the
solution
might
be
if
the
two
of
you
handle
this
whole
line
of
litigation
for
the
state,
perhaps
one
or
two
lawyers
to
handle
the
other
side
of
all
this
litigation
might
be
an
alternative
that
is
less
expensive
then
all
these
library
facilities.
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
case
right
here
which
says
that
in
texas
they
do
not
have
any
kinds
of
original
filing.
unknown
speaker
but,
we
have
the
case
pending
right
now
that
--
unknown
speaker
where
the
inmate
filed
the
case
and
if
the
judge
decides
it
has
got
merit
then
he
lets
the
government
know
about
the
state.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
distance,
don’t
we
have
a
geological
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
does
your
state
have
a
limit
on
the
number
inmates
to
be
confined
in
one
institution,
statutory
limitation?
unknown
speaker
and
did
you
say
77
different
institutions?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
total
number
of
prisoners
approximately?
unknown
speaker
are
prisoners
with
means
limited
to
the
use
of
the
official
library
or
may
they
buy
their
own
book?
unknown
speaker
well,
any
official
library.
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
will
ask
you,
does
the
prisoner
with
means
--
is
he
permitted
to
buy
law
books?
unknown
speaker
as
many
as
he
wants?
unknown
speaker
as
many
as
he
wants.
unknown
speaker
are
there
law
books
available
in
the
prisons?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
the
ones
that
prisoners
themselves
own?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
permit
counseling
between
inmates?
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
answer
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
enough
books
so
that
a
counseling
inmates
will
know
what
he
is
doing
and
--
unknown
speaker
one
of
them
describes
himself
as
legal
assistant.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
have
suggested
they
just
want
to
buy
their
books
worth.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that?
wasn’t
that
the
summary
affirmance?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
just
still
just
a
one
sense
affirmance,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
think
whatever
it
might
be
our
authority
to
re-examine
but
the
fourth
circuit
had
no
choice
under
hicks
and
miranda
but
to
follow.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
that
the
question
was
in
the
gilmore
case
there?
unknown
speaker
but
how
could
that
be
decided
simply
by
citation
johnson
v.
avery
which
is
all
that
gilmore
cites?
unknown
speaker
why
do
not
you
finish
the
question
that
was
presented.
unknown
speaker
let
me
read
this
from
the
jurisdictional
statement.
or
alternatively,
to
provide
inmates
with
professional
or
quasi-professional
legal
assistance?
unknown
speaker
or
wouldn’t
they
require
lawyers,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
there
are
reasonably
confident
fellow
prisoners
to
serve
the
inmates.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
may
have
them
on
their
own.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
is
not
showing
here
that
they
do
not
have
them,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
has
got
the
burden,
you
or
the
state?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
state
supplied
law
books.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
at
a
particular
prison
there
are
writ
writers
or
inmates
with
their
own
supply
of
law
books,
and
they
are
reasonably
confident,
would
you
say
the
state’s
duty
is
satisfied
or
not?
unknown
speaker
how
about
it,
how
about
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
but
my
question
was
if
there
is
a
writ
writer
there
with
his
own
law
books,
does
that
satisfy
the
state’s
duty?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
johnson
v.
avery
has
got
to
do
that
question?
unknown
speaker
doesn’t
that
suggest
those
other
writ
writers
might
satisfy
a
constitutional
requirement?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
go,
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
and
may
it
be
managed
by
less
or
full
number
of
judges
of
that
court?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
but
here
cert
has
granted
on
both
(inaudible)
or
anything
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well
okay.
is
it
or
is
it
not
obligated
to
furnish
him
a
qualified
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
is
it
or
is
it
not
obligated
to
furnish
him
a
trained
paralegal?
unknown
speaker
something
in
that
area,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
this
same
question
comes
up
before
judge
larkin
again
and
we
have
this
situation
i
have
hypothesized
to
you.
now,
what
is
going
to
be
your
answer
and
response
put
a
petition
in
the
court
or
your
answer
if
you
are
the
judge?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
constitutionally
required.
unknown
speaker
what
is
something?
not
a
lawyer
and
you
say
perhaps
not
a
trained
paralegal
here.
unknown
speaker
can
you
think
of
any?
unknown
speaker
pursuant
to
the
district
court’s
requirement,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
comment
on
your
opposition’s
suggestion
that,
that
creates
a
powerbase
for
the
inmate
paralegal?
unknown
speaker
but
the
statement
was
made
here
today.
unknown
speaker
just
to
be
sure,
and
i
want
to
nail
this
down
for
my
own
purpose,
you
are
not
attacking
in
any
way
the
constitutionality
of
the
plan
that
is
submitted?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
interrupt
there,
since
you
referred
to
that.
would
you
also
agree
that
the
library
facilities
would
perhaps
no
longer
be
constitutionally
required
if
there
were
no
alternative
programs
such
as
student
lawyers
of
some
kind
or
other
outside
the
prison
system?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this
also
while
i
have
interrupted
you.
in
the
younger
case,
as
i
remember
it,
there
was
the
california
system
did
allow
some
access
by
the
prisoners
to
the
state
law
library
as
to
a
challenges
that
has
not
been
adequate.
is
that
true
in
north
carolina
that
the
prisoners
have
any
access
to
the
state
law
library?
unknown
speaker
you
have
just
responded
that
this
alternative
we
are
provided
then
libraries
would
not
be
necessary.
what
if
someone
comes
in
and
points
out
that
in
faretta
v.
united
states,
i
think
it
was
the
court
held
that
every
individual
has
the
right
to
represent
himself
as
his
own
counsel,
and
we
have
such
a
person
in
the
prison
says
under
faretta,
“i
want
to
be
my
own
counsel.
therefore,
i
must
be
furnished
with
all
of
the
facilities
that
i
need,
even
though
i
am
the
only
one
out
of
the
2000
prisoners
here
who
wants
to
do
it
this
way.”
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
talking
about
is
that
if
faretta
gives
the
person
a
right
to
represent
himself
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
would
it
not
fall
a
matter
of
courts
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
represent
himself
in
anything
less
than
the
trial
of
a
contested
criminal
case.
unknown
speaker
then,
what
happens
to
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
they
are
addressing
themselves
to
question
of
policy
and
procedure
not
to
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
now,
as
far
back
as
ten
or
twelve
years
ago,
some
of
us
were
parties
to
a
program
that
advocated
and
carried
out
on
appellate
basis,
circuit
writing
lawyer,
not
law
students,
circuit
writing
lawyer
who
would
periodically
show
up
to
prison
to
help
prisoners.
that
is
--
you
would
not
regard
that
as
a
commitment
on
the
constitutional
issue,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
the
state’s
position
that
it
is
necessary
because
it
was
required
by
an
action
of
a
district
court.
that
it
not
what
they
said
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
yeah,
that
because
it
set
before.
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
a
filing
without
that
decision?
unknown
speaker
well,
don’t
we
have
to
consider
in
that
light,
an
application
to
the
leaa,
don’t
we?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
accept
the
fact
that
they
have
made
it
after
the
court’s
decision.
