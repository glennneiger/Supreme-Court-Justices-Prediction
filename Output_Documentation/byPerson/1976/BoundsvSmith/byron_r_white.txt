white
in
the
still
over
your
dissent.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
few
situations
where
the
relief
sought
is
obviously
frivolous,
like
we
have
had
complaints
filed
--
i
want
credit
for
a
time
spent
on
the
escape.
in
those
instances
the
petition
would
be
summarily
denied.
now
the
inmate
need
merely
give
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
the
entire
record
goes
up
to
the
fourth
circuit
where
a
three-judge
panel,
in
the
circuit
court
reviews
it,
and
the
circuit
court
judges
have
the
assistance
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
holding
in
the
district
court
at
least
california
as
it
provides
either
legal
research
facility
or
lawyer
or
lawsuits?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn’t
say
that
the
fellow
inmates
would
be
enough
to
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
provision
of
the
constitution
as
if
that
provides
the
right
to
law
libraries
for
prisoners?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
what
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
court’s
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
right
extend
to
the
right
of
inmates,
if
the
next
step,
every
inmate,
they
have
the
lawyer
to
interpret
the
cases
he
finds
in
the
laws
books
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
an
inmate
comes
in
the
court
and
says,
i
have
had
a
second
grade
education,
my
iq
is
85.
it
is
true
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
furnishes
a
lot
of
law
books
but
i
simply
an
incapable
of
reading
it.
i
am
being
denied
a
right
that
others
who
are
better
able
to
read
the
law
book
have.
so,
i
want
a
lawyer.
what
is
your
response
to
that
kind
of
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question,
does
the
constitution
require
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
furnish
a
lawyer
to
this
particular
person,
i
have
hypothesized
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
has
constitutionally
obligated
to
furnish
him
a
trained
paralegal?
