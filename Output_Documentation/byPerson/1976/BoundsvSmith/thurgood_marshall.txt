justice
thurgood
marshall
how
in
the
world
would
you
find
out
what
the
court
really
wants
to
do?
what
he
would
say,
i
am
going
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
he
would
say
i
am
going
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
my
question.
is
that
what
you
think
is
proper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
secondly,
is
that
helpful
to
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
they
become
effective
without
the
knowledge
of
the
fourth
circuit
counsel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
suppose
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
he
did
your
honor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
he
was
working
on
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
bet
i
have
seen
some
you
have
miscited
too,
if
i
look
to
all
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
understand
your
point.
your
point
is
that
it
will
not
help
them
to
have
the
library,
that
he
does
not
need
the
library.
now,
he
is
on
one
side
of
the
case
and
as
my
brother
stevens
said,
you
--
and
you
are
obviously
are
on
the
other
side
--
you
have
blank
number
of
assistance,
blank
number
of
paralegal,
blank
number
of
libraries
and
everything
and
that
is
an
equal
play,
and
it
is
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
case
avery,
despite
what
you
have,
i
think
avery
is
still
a
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
johnson
v.
avery
says
one
of
the
ways
of
doing
it
is
giving
him
some
help.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
said,
give
him
some
help.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
us
to
overrule
younger
and
gilmore,
donâ€™t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondents
who
are
inmates
of
the
north
carolina
state
prisons
brought
this
action
in
the
federal
district
court
against
the
petitioner
of
the
state
prison
administrators.
respondents
claim
their
rights
of
access
to
the
courts
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
required
the
state
to
assist
them
in
preparing
habeas
corpus
as
civil
rights
actions
by
making
available
a
source
of
legal
knowledge
such
as
law
books
or
independent
legal
advisors.
the
district
court,
following
a
per
curiam
decision
of
this
court
six
years
ago
agreed
and
ordered
the
state
to
establish
minimum
prison
law
libraries.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
for
reasons
explained
and
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
fundamental
right
of
access
to
the
courts
requires
prison
authorities
to
assist
inmates
in
preparation
in
filing
a
meaningful
legal
papers
provide
--
by
providing
with
adequate
law
books
or
adequate
assistant
from
persons
trained
in
the
law.
accordingly,
we
affirm
judgment
below.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
consent
--
a
concurring
statement.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
