mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
the
grant
of
a
petition
for
the
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
review
similar
claims
brought
by
various
north
carolina
prisoners
to
the
effect
that
by
not
providing
them
with
legal
research
facilities,
the
state
of
north
carolina
has
denied
their
access
to
the
courts.
the
district
court
in
its
original
opinion
tracked
the
language
of
the
three-judge
federal
court
in
california
and
gilmore
v.
lynch,
and
stated
that
the
volumes
available
would
provide
meagre
fare
for
a
lawyer
who
is
trained
in
his
profession
and
even
more
meagre
fare
for
an
inmate
who
has
no
legal
training
to
assist
him
in
discerning
how
to
file,
what
petitions,
and
what
to
include
in
them.
the
court
takes
notice
of
more
than
mere
facts
are
necessary
in
order
to
file
petition
for
relief
by
a
way
of
habeas
corpus,
for
example.
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
an
opinion
which
is
quite
simplistic
in
its
approach
stating
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
has
an
obligation
under
the
various
cases
to
provide
legal
research
facilities.
it
is
our
argument
and
we
submit
that
the
district
court
erred
and
at
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
erred
in
its
conclusions.
one,
that
extensive
legal
research
facilities
are
required,
and
number
two,
that
there
is
in
fact
a
constitutional
obligation
as
a
primary
obligation
to
provide
these
facilities.
now,
in
support
of
this
argument
i
would
first
like
to
point
out
that
this
court
has
promulgated
rules,
which
go
into
effect
just
about
any
day
now,
the
new
rules
governing
section
2254
cases.
these
rules
go
into
affect
pursuant
to
public
law
94-349,
30
days
after
the
recess
of
the
94th
congress.
now,
we
take
a
look
at
these
rules,
we
also
take
a
look
at
the
forms
in
those
rules
and
the
forms
currently
available
in
all
of
the
united
states
district
courts
to
file
habeas
corpus
proceedings
for
state
court
prisoners
in
the
district
courts.
i
have
here
a
typical
sample
which
i
am
sure
the
court
is
well
aware,
a
fill
in
the
blanks
form
available
from
any
united
states
district
court
clerk,
and
the
forms
are
quite
clear
that
just
set
forth
facts.
now
under
the
rules
which
go
into
effect
any
day
now,
the
rules
of
this
court,
utilizing
the
forms
provided
for
in
these
rules.
it
states
quite
clearly,
number
one,
in
the
instructions,
in
setting
forth
the
grounds,
supporting
facts
and
the
word
‘facts’
as
prepared
by
this
court
is
in
capital
letters,
supporting
facts
(tell
your
story
briefly
without
citing
cases
or
law).
now
these
are
the
forms
for
use
in
habeas
corpus
which
any
day
now
will
be
in
effect,
and
the
instructions
of
this
court
in
order
to
gain
access
to
the
united
states
district
courts
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
are
tell
your
story
briefly
without
citing
cases
or
law.
in
civil
rights
matters
there
are
the
recommendations
of
the
federal
judicial
conference.
these
recommendations
include
various
recommended
forms.
the
instructions
that
go
with
these
forms
state,
“you
will
note
that
you
are
required
to
give
a
fax.
this
complaint
should
not
contain
legal
arguments
or
citations.
these
forms
go
on
to
provide
statement
of
claim.
state
here
as
briefly
as
possible
the
facts
of
your
case,
describe
how
each
defendant
is
involved,
include
also
the
names
of
other
persons
involve
dates
and
places.
do
not
give
any
legal
arguments
or
cite
any
cases
or
statutes.”
in
the
prayer
for
relief
contained
in
this
printed
form
paragraph
five,
relief.
"state
briefly
exactly
what
you
want
the
court
to
do
for
you.
make
no
legal
arguments,
cite
no
cases
or
statutes.”
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
your
honor
this
is
a
civil
rights
matter.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
seen
civil
rights
cases
where
that
is
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please
it
depends
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please
now,
in
the
middle
district
of
north
carolina
these
forms,
recommended
by
the
judicial
conference,
have
in
fact
been
adopted
by
local
rule.
i,
out
here,
a
civil
rights
case
i
filed,
i
responded
to
last
week.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
these
rules
came
out
subsequent
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
these
forms
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
and
these
rules
are
prepare
subsequent
to
that
argument,
but
the
point
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
no
idea
what
he
was
working
on
your
honor.
but
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
this
one
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well
this
is
the
civil
rights
form.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes
we
do,
but
now
on
this
particular
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
what
i
mean
is
this
your
honor.
the
theory
is
that
the
inmate
requires
legal
research
facilities
in
order
to
have
access
to
the
courts,
and
my
thesis
is
this,
there
is
access
to
the
courts.
the
federal
judiciary
has
developed
forms
which
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
you
are
not
to
cite
cases,
you
are
not
give
legal
arguments
in
these
filings.
now
justice
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes,
but
the
theory
of
these
cases
up
to
this
point
has
been
that
the
inmate
has
been
denied
access
to
the
courts
because
they
have
not
had
legal
research
facilities,
and
there
is
that
thesis
with
which
we
do
not
agree,
because
as
we
take
mr.
justice
white’s
dissent
in
johnson
v.
avery
which
is
the
fountainhead
case
in
this
area.
he
made
it
clear
that
filing
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
a
simple
matter
because
once
it
is
filed
the
court
will
apply
the
law
to
the
facts,
and
that
is
what
happens
in
all
these
whether
vast
majority
of
the
prisoner
cases.
the
court
obviously
through
the
use
of
its
law
clerk,
these
legal
research
facilities,
the
courts
as
this
court
have
law
clerks
whom
they
carefully
interview
from
many,
many
clerks
who
are
legally
trained,
so
that
they
could
provide
a
meaningful
assistance
to
the
court.
i
questioned
what
type
of
meaningful
assistance
has
given
the
court,
the
federal
judiciary
or
the
state
judiciary
by
some
inmate
who
probably
has
a
sixth
grade
education
who
is
not
trained
in
the
law.
he
cannot
help
the
court.
i
have
some
cases
cited,
most
cases
which
were
cited
by
the
inmates
are
miscited
or
have
no
--
cannot
even
be
found.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
is
quite
possible
your
honor,
but
we
try
not
to.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
first
of
all
your
honor
i
mean
we
are
at
only
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
i
agree
that
johnson
v.
avery
is
the
law,
because
--
let
us
read
johnson
v.
avery
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
no,
johnson
v.
avery
says
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
johnson
v.
avery
sets
that
there
is
a
secondary
obligation,
and
the
secondary
obligation
is,
if
the
state
prohibits
mutual
legal
assistance
between
inmates
then
that
gives
rise
to
a
necessity
to
determine
alternatives.
johnson
v.
avery
is
clear.
the
law
library
is
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
sir.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
i
do.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no
your
honor,
not
at
all.
although
johnson
v.
avery
states
is
that
if
in
the
event
the
state,
the
department
of
corrections
in
a
particular
state
passes
a
regulation
prohibiting
mutual
legal
assistance,
then
in
that
event
alternatives
are
required.
now,
we
turn
to
one
of
the
last
definitive
statements
on
this
point
of
this
court,
the
case
of
ross
v.
moffitt
written
by
your
honor.
now,
in
ross
v.
moffitt,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
it
is
not
the
obligation
of
the
state
to
provide
that
legal
arsenal
which
is
available
to
the
private
citizen.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
that
if
the
library
would
be
provided
it
is
in
a
ministry
of
decision
of
the
state,
and
that
the
constitution
and
the
cases
of
this
court
do
not
require
the
state
to
provide
legal
research
facilities.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please,
number
one,
filing
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
a
simplest
thing
in
the
world.
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
in
his
dissent,
we
need
only
look
at
the
record.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh
yes
your
honor,
but
in
your
dissent
you
pointed
out
and
how
the
majority
agreed
that
filing
a
habeas
corpus
petition
is
a
simplest
thing.
no
facts,
no
lawyers
required
you
just
take
the
facts,
and
obviously
--
and
it
is
been
my
experience
and
as
your
honors
are
well
aware
--
when
these
petitions
come
in,
the
federal
judge
and
his
law
clerk
and
the
united
states
magistrate
reviews
these
things.
it
is
been
my
experience
that
of
course
--
let
us
see
what
happens.
in
that
particular
situation
it
is
reviewed
and
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
younger
case.
i
would
say
this
that
younger
was
improperly
decided
that
younger
should
be
overruled.
we
have
a
one
paragraph
per
curiam
and
it
cites
two
cases,
alabama
teachers
which
merely
goes
to
the
proposition
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court,
and
it
cites
johnson
v.
avery.
now,
johnson
v.
avery
merely
held
explicitly
that
the
state
has
no
such
obligation
unless
there
is
a
prohibition
of
mutual
legal
assistance.
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
as
the
court
readily
finds,
there
is
no
such
prohibition
against
mutual
legal
assistance.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
to
perhaps
a
small
handful
of
inmates
they
maybe
useful,
a
small
handful
of
inmates
who
perhaps
have
the
intelligence
to
utilize
these
facilities,
but
as
a
member
of
the
bar,
quite
frankly
i
almost
take
this
as
a
personal
insult.
i
went
through
the
college,
i
went
through
the
law
school,
i
took
the
bar
exam
in
order
to
be
trained
in
legal
research,
and
quite
often
as
this
case
itself
reveals,
there
are
attorneys
on
both
sides
and
courts
on
both
sides
which
disagree
on
what
the
law
actually
is
in
any
given
case.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
what
happened
there,
we
were
under
the
order
of
judge
larkin
(ph)
to
implement
this.
the
director
of
prisons
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
went
before
the
advisory
budget
commission
of
the
north
carolina
general
assembly
with
judge
larkin’s
order
in
hand,
and
the
advisory
budget
commission
of
the
state
in
preparing
the
budget
for
submission
found
or
said
that
they
would
not
appropriate
such
funds,
that
they
have
never
heard
of
any
thing
as
foolish
as
that,
that
they
had
other
needs
for
state
resources,
and
they
were
not
going
to
appropriate
money
for
prison
law
libraries
when
the
state
has
not
yet
found
it
able
financially
to
provide
any
such
facilities
to
the
judges
of
our
courts
of
the
state
or
our
district
attorneys.
it
would
in
fact
result
that
in
many
areas
the
judges
do
you
find
such
facilities
would
be
appearing
in
the
prisons.
now,
we
have
77
units
spread
across
our
state,
across
475
miles.
it
would
be
as
if
we
went
from
raleigh,
where
i
live,
to
new
york
city,
that
is
the
distance,
a
tremendous
distance.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
an
leaa
grant
was
prepared
because
the
general
assembly
refused
to
fund
any
money
and
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
would
not
condone
any
line
item
transfers.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please,
when
one
applies
for
a
grant
one
puffs
to
get
the
money
and
that
was
puffing
to
receive
an
leaa
grant
because
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
but
your
honor
please
that
still
does
not
get
to
the
basic
constitutional
question.
now,
we
have
not
provided
our
judiciary
with
such
resources,
we
are
not
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
unfortunately
that
grant
was
salesmanship.
it
was
seeking,
that
application
was
seeking
a
grant.
you
have
to
say
what
leaa
wants
to
hear
to
get
the
grant.
now,
the
facts
and
figures
are
interesting.
in
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
1973
some
46%
of
all
prisoner
civil
rights
cases
of
the
united
states
were
filed.
in
1974
the
figure
went
down,
in
75
20%
of
all
the
petitions
of
the
united
sates.
nationally
18%
of
all
cases
filed
in
the
united
states
district
courts
are
prisoner
petitions.
in
north
carolina
the
percentage
is
41%
of
all
petitions
filed,
are
filed
by
prisoners.
now,
the
state
of
north
carolina
this
year
has
appropriated
$5,700,000
for
aid
to
indigent
defendants.
we
have
complete
post
conviction
procedures.
as
in
the
federal
system
when
a
post
conviction
application
is
filed
the
judge
reviews
it,
if
there
is
any
merit
he
appoints
counsel,
if
he
finds
no
merit
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice,
as
we
were
stating
at
the
break,
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
we
have
developed
extensive
state
post
conviction
proceedings
and
also
have
extensive
rules
for
the
appointment
of
the
counsel
to
indigent
defendants.
as
in
the
federal
system
when
a
state
court
prisoner
files
a
petition
that
petition
is
reviewed
by
the
state
court
judge.
if
the
state
court
judge
finds
any
merit
in
the
petition
he
will
point
counsel
to
represent
the
petition
in
a
plenary
hearing.
if
he
finds
no
merit
in
the
petition,
he
obviously
dismisses
the
petition.
however,
in
the
state
court
system
unlike
the
federal
system
the
inmate
has
an
absolute
right
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
seek
certiorari
from
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
therefore,
he
has
counsel
to
prepare
his
petition
for
the
certiorari
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
where
it
is
reviewed
and
of
course
ruled
upon
that
court.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
our
brief
there
is
an
appendix.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
of
course
your
honor,
he
is
provided
with
the
copy
of
the
order
of
the
court
denying
his
petition,
and
under
north
carolina
general
statute
15222
which
provides
for
petitions
for
certiorari
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals,
and
north
carolina
general
statute
7a-451,
which
is
the
statute
providing
with
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigents,
all
he
merely
do
is
write
the
court,
request
the
appointment
of
counsel,
and
counsel
will
be
appointed
to
represent
him
on
a
petition
for
cert
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
of
course,
your
honor
at
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
the
court
finds
merit
and
holds
a
hearing,
he
has
a
right
to
counsel,
yes,
but
if
the
court
finds
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
a
plausible
case,
he
has
a
right
under
our
statute
7a-451
to
the
appointment
of
the
counsel,
and
the
court
appoints
counsel
to
represent
that
petitioner.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
has
an
absolute
right
of
appointment
of
counsel
to
assist
him,
to
prepare
the
petition
for
cert
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
he
writes
a
letter
to
the
court,
i
appeal,
appoint
the
lawyer
for
me.
and
so
actually
in
the
state
system
a
lawyer
is
appointed
whereas
in
the
federal
system
at
that
there
is
no
right
to
the
counsel.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
at
the
either
point.
i
would
like
to
point
out
the
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
merits,
we
have
reviewed
the
histories
of
these
various
inmates
who
are
the
plaintiffs
in
the
initial
case.
now,
the
various
cases
which
we
refer,
mr.
nakell
sent
a
young
attorney
who
spent
two
days
in
our
office
reviewing
all
of
these
files.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
read
that
appendix,
at
appendix
commencing
on
page
25.
it
reveals
how
the
state
has
appointed
counsel
time
and
time
again
at
these
post
convection
proceedings,
how
the
state
has
appointed
counsel
on
petition
for
review
on
certiorari,
how
these
inmates
have
had
their
day
in
court
time
and
time
and
time
again.
i
submit
that
every
view
of
this
reveals
that
they
have
not
been
denied
access,
they
have
not
been
denied
meaningful
access,
and
that
these
inmates
have
had
more
than
their
day
in
court.
i
would
further
submit
that
this
court
issue
clear
in
the
instructions
to
the
inferior
federal
courts
that
a
rereading
of
johnson
v.
avery
is
required,
that
the
fountainhead
case
here
states
that
the
alternatives
are
required
if
there
is
a
state
regulation
prohibiting
mutual
legal
assistance
between
inmates.
there
is
no
such
prohibition
in
north
carolina.
therefore,
the
requirement
of
johnson
v.
avery
does
not
come
into
play.
one
must
also
read
ross
v.
moffitt
in
conjunction
with
johnson
v.
avery.
the
state
is
not
required
to
provide
the
same
arsenal
to
prisoners,
the
same
legal
resources
as
a
private
citizen
may
obtain.
i
would
further
suggest
that
the
case
of
gilmore
v.
lynch
be
reread,
because
that
court
assumed
as
many
federal
courts
have
been
assuming
that
there
is
a
definite
obligation
to
provide
legal
facilities.
the
lower
courts
have
misread
johnson;
they
have
gone
to
step
two
without
ever
seeing
what
is
required
to
reach
step
two.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no
question
about
it
your
honor,
there
would
be
equal
protection
problem.
but
i
would
say
this
we
have
a
situation
with
77
units
in
our
state
covering
475
miles.
most
of
these
units
as
the
fourth
circuit
readily
acknowledges
are
small,
they
are
set
in
localities
throughout
the
state.
so,
we
can
have
work
release,
so,
we
can
have
study
release,
so
they
can
be
closed
to
their
families.
we
will
have
an
incredible
equal
protection
problem
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
with
these
small
units
spread
across
the
state.
it
is
been
our
intention
to
keep
the
inmates
close
to
home,
it
is
been
our
intention
to
let
them
be
where
they
could
get
work
release
jobs,
study
release
jobs.
a
situation
like
this
could
be
counterproductive
because
we
would
be
forced
due
to
the
sure
expense
of
providing
these
facilities
which
are
not
available
to
the
private
citizen
in
the
streets,
which
are
not
available
to
our
judges,
which
are
not
available
to
das.
quite
frankly,
our
law
library
is
the
library
at
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
we
in
the
attorney
general’s
office,
and
just
the
two
of
us
who
handle
this
multiplicity
of
cases.
we
do
not
have
our
own
law
library
facility;
we
use
the
supreme
court’s
library
at
the
sufferances
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
they
could
enter
an
order
any
day
saying
that
it
is
just
for
our
own
use.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
they
pick
up
the
phone
and
call
as
your
honor.
we
run
upstairs
to
the
fifth
floor
and
use
the
supreme
court’s
library.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean
if
you
want
to
--
that
is
exactly
what
happens.
they
pick
up
the
phone
and
they
call
us.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
i
mean
they
pick
up
a
phone
and
call.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
all
of
the
judges,
the
district
attorneys.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
the
convict
does
not
call,
but
i
am
saying,
we
do
not
have
these
facilities
for
our
judiciary.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
that
is
of
course,
up
to
the
general
assembly.
in
their
wisdom
they
make
these
decisions.
but
we
have
a
novak
v.
beto
problem
which
should
arise
as
in
texas
where
several
attorneys
were
appointed
and
then
the
court
found
that
those
attorneys
were
insufficient
and
finally
they
had
to
have
15
attorneys.
i
believe
that
was
the
number
in
texas,
because
the
federal
court
down
there
found
that
it
took
15
attorneys
to
provide
meaningful
access.
15
attorneys
compared
to
our
staff
is
an
incredible
number.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
i
know
they
are
15
lawyers.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
aspect
of
that.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
in
texas
there
are
15
lawyers
that
i
know,
and
i
also
know
that
in
texas
all
the
penal
institutions
are
within
ten
miles
of
one
another.
they
have
got
them
consolidated,
so
they
can
use
common
facilities
and
common
resources.
our
facilities
are
not
consolidated.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
state
facilities
your
honor
i
must
once
made
inquiry,
i
believe
they
are
all
in
the
panhandle
there
and
they
are
all
within
one
limited
distance.
so,
they
have
common
resources
as
far
as
hospitals
and
ministration
and
things
of
that
nature.
we
are
spread,
we
are
spread
across
the
map.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor
we
do
not,
and
at
this
point
in
time
quite
frankly
we
are
over
crowded
and
we
need
all
the
money
we
can
and
we
are
trying
to
get
all
the
money
we
can
new
institutions.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
up
to
time
there
were
77
and
since
then
we
have
opened
up
a
series
of
new
halfway
houses
for
women.
i
do
not
know
how
many
there
are,
but
we
have
77
main
institutions
or
we
have
several
main
institutions
in
a
series
of
subsidiaries
spread
across
475
miles.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
heard
the
last
figure
i
saw
unfortunately
was
like
13,350.
we
are
over
crowded;
we
need
money
for
new
facilities,
and
the
general
assembly
has
determined
that
all
resources
should
be
applied
to
other
needs
which
they
have
determined
to
be
more
pressing
than
providing
law
libraries
for
prisoners.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
what
official
library
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
sorry,
your
honor,
we
do
not
have
libraries
in
the
prisons.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
from
the
publisher.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
maybe
regulations
prohibiting
the
absolute
number
as
far
as
crowd
in
the
cell
is
concerned,
but
i
know
inmates
who
have
arrived
at
prison
with
like
three
cases
of
books
and
pleadings,
and
these
things
were
kept
stored
for
him.
there
is
a
limit
what
can
be
kept
in
the
cell
obviously
for
saftey
reasons
and
fire
reasons.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
as
a
practical
matter
there
are,
except
to
those
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well
those
are
available,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
that
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
we
do
not
prohibit
it
and
if
we
don’t
prohibit
it
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
some
of
these
counseling,
in
fact
your
honor
i
will
say
this,
there
is
an
association
north
carolina
writ
writers,
and
those
inmates,
particularly
the
inmates
here
who
file
the
suit.
they
are
prolific,
many
of
them
hold
themselves
out
as
professional
writ
writers
and
they
sign
the
pleadings.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor.
in
fact,
that
case
ultimately
came
here
bradford
v.
weinstein
case.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
exactly,
your
honor,
and
so
that
they
could
have
a
power
base
within
the
penal
system.
they
will
really
become
powerful
then
they
will
be
the
men
with
the
law
books
who
will
write
over
petitions.
thank
you,
your
honor.
