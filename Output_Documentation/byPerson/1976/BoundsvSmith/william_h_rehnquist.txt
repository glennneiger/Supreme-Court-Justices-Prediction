justice
william
h.
rehnquist
johnson
was
talking
about
a
prohibition
of
availability,
not
an
affirmative
making
available.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
order
to
get
any
benefit
from
johnson
v.
avery,
in
this
case,
donâ€™t
you
first
have
to
show
that
north
carolina
prohibits
the
availability
of
writ
writers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
made
that
showing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
so
not
get
any
backup
from
johnson
against
avery
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now
you
say
younger
against
gilmore
went
beyond
johnson
v.
avery.
yet,
it
is
a
one
sentence
affirmance
and
the
only
case
that
cites
on
the
merits
is
johnson
v.
avery.
