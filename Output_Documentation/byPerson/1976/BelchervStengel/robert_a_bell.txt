mr.
robert
a.
bell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
up
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
on
the
question
to
the
fact
that
an
off-duty
police
officer,
out
of
uniform,
is
required
by
police
department
regulation
to
carry
a
weapon
at
all
times,
establish
that
any
use
of
that
weapon
against
the
person
of
another,
even
though
the
officer
is
engaged
in
private
conduct,
at
the
time
to
be
an
action
‘under
color
of
law’
within
the
meeting
of
42
u.s.c
section
1983.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
i
can
deal
with
it
in
just
a
moment,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
officer
testified
that
he
was
a
uniformed
officer
on
foot
patrol
in
area
in
columbus,
ohio
that
is
known
as
one
of
the
most
difficult
areas
to
patrol.
the
facts
of
this
case
will
bear
out
that
he
was
off-duty
out
of
uniform
and
was
a
columbus
police
officer.
so,
had
he
been
on
overtime,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
he
would
have
been
in
uniform.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
common
thing
but
again
it
would
depend,
i
think
depending
upon
other
factors
and
that
this
officer
was
a
foot
officer
on
patrol.
normally,
they
would
not
be
assigned
to
plain
clothes
duty,
doing
overtime
and
i
am
not
to
say
that,
that’s
true
in
every
case.
on
march
1st
1971,
the
petitioner,
off-duty,
out
of
uniform,
and
was
a
member
of
the
columbus
police
department,
a
columbus
police
officer.
approximately
at
1:15
am
in
the
morning,
was
in
a
public
bar
known
as
jimmy's
cafe
in
columbus,
ohio
on
the
private,
social
activity.
an
altercation
developed
in
this
bar
between
respondents
and
other
persons
in
the
bar,
not
including
the
petitioner
at
this
time.
the
petitioner
then
became
involved
in
this
altercation
and
as
a
result
of
his
becoming
involved
in
this
altercation,
he
resorted
to
the
use
of
a
32
caliber
automatic
weapon.
firing
it
into
the
air
and
the
use
of
this
weapon
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
respondents,
decedents
know
and
injuries
to
the
respondent,
stengel.
the
respondents
then
filed
two
complaints
on
the
state
of
facts
briefly
stated.
filed
a
complaint
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
franklin
county,
ohio,
state
court
and
a
complaint
in
united
states
district
court
alleging
violation
of
14
or
42
u.s.c
1983.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
no
sir,
to
answer
your
question.
the
complaint…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
it’s
correct,
justice
stevens.
the
respondents
dismissed
their
complaints…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
municipality,
not
against
the
officers,
but
against
municipality.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
correct
and
in
the
federal
system
and
monroe
versus
pape,
the
city
of
columbus
is
not
a
person
under
1983.
now,
the
complaint
was
dismissed
in
the
state
court
by
respondents
and
he
proceeded
to
try
the
case
in
united
states
district
court
upon
the
complaint
they
filed
stating
and
joining
12
officers
along
with
the
respondent,
belcher.
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff’s
case
that
the
12
officers
were
dismissed
and
the
respondent
remained
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
under
1985,
title
42
conspiracies
to
one,
to
cover
up
the
acts
of
the
respondent
belcher
and
two,
to
deprive
the
respondents
of
the
constitutional
rights
under
42
u.s.c.
1985.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that
is
correct,
and
they
were
in
the
chain
of
command.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
well,
in
the
board
of
enquiry,
which
was
the
firearms
board,
which
meets
every
time
an
officer
uses
his
firearm,
was
initiated
automatically
under
the
regulations
of
the
columbus
police
department.
it
was
not
initiated
by
the
respondents.
the
complaint
alleged
facts
in
general
in
the
paragraphs
4
and
5,
making
general
allegations
and
as
we
say
conclusions
of
law
that
at
all
times,
defendants
acted
‘under
color
of
law’
and
in
line
of
duty.
but
in
alleging
the
facts
as
to
the
petitioner’s
conduct
in
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint.
the
allegations
accepted
is
true
and
thinking
in
their
best
like
for
the
plaintiff
can
only
leave
the
conclusion
that
the
petitioner
did
not
act
‘under
color
of
law’.
the
facts
alleged
in
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint,
if
i
may
briefly
refer
to
them.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes
your
honor
and
it’s
began
at
page
8,
volume
one
and
i
am
referring
to
page
10
of
the…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
correct.
volume
one,

mr.
robert
a.
bell
and
i
am
reading
at
the
bottom
where
notice
that
says,
paragraph
8,
i
am
reading
at
the
bottom
where
it
begins,
“raymond
l.
belcher,
who
was
out
of
uniform
and
in
no
way
identified
as
a
columbus
policeman
and
in
no
way
involved
in
the
minor
dispute
heretofore
describe

by
attacking
one
of
the
plaintiffs
at
the
scene
from
the
rear
by
grabbing
him
around
the
neck
from
the
rear.
said
intervention
by
said
raymond
l.
belcher
8.33
being
without
any
notification
or
attempt
to
notify
anybody
in
the
café
that
he
was
an
off-duty
columbus
policeman
and
without
any
attempt
by
said
raymond
l.
belcher
to
make
the
police
arrest,
or
a
citizen’s
arrest
of
any
kind
at
this
time.
the
facts
go
on
to
state,
casey
b.
stengel,
one
of
the
respondents,
before
the
court,
attempted
to
kick
the
chemical
mace
equipment,
which
raymond
l.
belcher
pulled
from
his
clothing
and
which
was
blinding
and
choking
the
people
involved
from
the
hand
of
the
said
raymond
l.
belcher.
whereupon,
still
without
any
warning,
identification,
or
attempt
to
make
an
arrest,
said
raymond
l.
belcher
pulled
a
gun
from
his
clothing,
which
gun
he
was
ordered
and
directed
to
carry
as
an
off-duty
columbus
policeman
and
that
time
he
shot
into
the
air
resulting
in
the
deaths
of
the
respondent
noel,
respondent
ruff
(ph)
and
injury
to
respondent
stengel.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that
was
the
testimony
of
raymond
l.
belcher.
he
was
testified
that
he
was
on
the
floor
on
his
back
being
stumped
and
at
that
time,
he
pulled
the
gun
out
from
under
his
back
and
shot
into
the
air
to
get
these
men
off
to
him.
the
shots
struck
and
caused
the
damage.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that
is
correct.
that
was
a
statement
made
at
the
close
by
the
defense
counsel
and
then
the
city
attorney,
who
prior
to
that
and
at
the
time
of
this
act,
was
the
saftey
director
and
issued
an
order
and
a
letter
to
mr.
belcher.
the
statement
was
made
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff’s
case
and
argument
for
a
directed
verdict
of
acquittal.
the
court
did
not
accept
that
statement
as
i
understand
it
as
a
stipulation
because
he
went
on
further
to
charge
the
jury
as
to
the
facts.
i
submit…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes,
he
did
and
i
respectfully
submit.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
mr.
justice
that
the
statement
at
the
including
argument
was
not
evidence
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
statement
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff’s
case
was
not
evidenced.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
the
police
enquiry
board
did
find
that
the
officer
has
justified
in
use
of
his
weapon…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
…in
the
line
of
duty.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
well,
i
was
not
at
the
trial
and
i
don’t
recall,
i
am
sure
it
was
put
in
by
the
defendant
or
i
mean,
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
could
have.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
his
theory
of
defense,
but
i
can’t
answer
you
as
to
the
defense
counsel
but
i
am
sure
that
the
plaintiff
would
put
that
into.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
the
statement
from
bonnie
lawman
was
the
only
statement
that
we
could
find
that
it
indicated.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
statements
by
bonnie
lawman
was,
as
far
as
we
were
concerned,
was
what
she
heard,
number
one,
and
we
know
from
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
that
he
did
not
identify
himself
or
attempt
to
act
‘under
color
of
law’
even
though
the
respondents
may
have
thought
he
was
or
even
questioned
him.
they
did
not
perceive
his
actions
from
as
i
see
--
read
the
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint
where
i
am
arguing
at
this
point
to
have
been
acting
‘under
color
of
law’.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
if
he
had
been
in
uniform
and
on-duty,
he
had
been
acting
under
code
of
law.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
because
he
would
have
to
14.12
the
authority,
he
would
have
the
14.14,
symbol
of
it.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that’s
what
i
was
going
to
lead
up
to.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
well,
because
if
excessive
force
is
used
‘under
color
of
law’
that
is
the
very
thing
that
1983
seeks
to
protect.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
the
taking
of
life,
the
fourteenth
amendment…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
well,
perhaps,
mr.
justice,
i
don’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
because
under
1983
if
there
is
an
abuse
of
authority
or
a
misuse
of
authority,
as
stated
in
the
traditional
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
before.
that
is
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
the
right
to
not
be
punished
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes,
but
in
the
traditional
case,
the
cases
before
this
court,
the
law
has
been
set
forth
that
the
misuse
of
power
possessed
by
virtue
of
state
law
and
made
possible
only
because
the
wrong
door
is
closed
with
the
authority
of
state
law,
is
action
taken
under
color
of
law,
state
law
16.49.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
alright,
therefore,
if
he
takes
action
under
color
of
law
and
misuse
that
authority
to,
let’s
say…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
i
realize
that,
i
realize
that,
but
i
am
trying
to
be
professionally
honest
with
the
court
as
i
can.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
it
is
our
position
and
he
would
not
in
that
case.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
there
is
no
difference
in
that
sense,
but
in
our
position
of
that
case
and
this
case,
as
you
stated
and
that
is
what
i
am
arguing.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
right,
in
the
latter
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
agree
that
the
victim
of
the
automobile
would
not
be
deprived
of
constitutional
right
and
would
not
be
in
action
under
1983.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
and
that
is
the
one
of
the
reason
of
our
argument,
that’s
one
of
the
purposes
of
our
argument
that
we
do
not
feel
that
1983
should
19.02
under
the
color
law
should
be
extended
to
include
these
private
acts
and
they
would
open
up…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
it
is
our
contention
that
the
district
court
hits
on
that
spirit
that
he
was
carrying
the
gun
only
in
his
charge
and
we
feel
that
overall
that
charge
is
not
objected,
to
which
i
will
get
to
later
in
argument,
we
feel
that
it
was
fundamental
error.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
it
could
be.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
i
would
turn
on
my
judgment,
it
would
turn
on
if
the
officer
arrested
the
person,
took
him
into
custody
and
then
proceeded
to
be
the
confession
out
of
him
or
to
in
someway…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
screws,
yes,
your
honor,
or
the…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that
is
correct
and
this
court
reversed
the
screws’
case
upon
the
charge
of
the
court,
calling
it
fundamental
error
because
the
court
did
not
charge
on
that
very
point,
justice
marshall,
and
that
was
a
criminal
case
under
18
u.s.c
section
242.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
to
further
answer
justice
rehnquist’s
question,
the
case
most
in
point
is
the
matter
of
williams
v.
the
u.s.
where
a
private
detective
in
state
of
florida
was
engaged
by
a
lumberyard
to
catch
petty
thieves
and
he
had
an
authorization
issued
from
the
state.
he
also
had
within
an
on-duty
police
officer
in
uniform.
he
would
catch
these
people,
take
them
to
a
pain
shed
and
plead
confessions
out
of
them,
literally,
beat
confessions
out
of
them
and
at
the
time
that
he
was
doing
it,
which
is
very
significant
i
suggest,
he
was
flashing
his
batch,
his
color
of
authority.
this
was
not
done
in
this
case.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
facts
in
this
complaint
indicate
private
conduct
in
that
it
lacks
the
jurisdictional
--
creates
a
jurisdictional
fault
in
the
district
court,
as
attempting
to
include
within
1983
those
matters
that
are
private
acts
that
we
have
just
discussed.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that
was
dismissed
by
respondents
and
they
elected
to…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes.
therefore,
the
only
fact
in
the
complaint
from
which
we
can
derive
official
conduct
of
the
court
police
is
the
use
of
the
weapon,
which
complaint
alleges
petitioner
carrying
pursuant
to
a
department
regulation
requiring
off-duty
officers
to
carry
a
weapon
at
all
reasonable
times,
under
a
theory
that
officers
are
on-duty
24
hours
per
day.
to
focus
upon
the
use
of
that
weapon
alone,
coupled
with
the
facts
stated
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
they
will
use
in
only
in
a
totally
private
manner.
we
feel
it
does
not
state
facts
upon
relief
can
be
granted
and
as
if
the
weapon
used
is
by
and
of
itself
determine
to
satisfy
the
under
color
of
law
requirement,
then
once
again,
the
traditionally
excluded
private
uses
that
we
have
already
discussed
with
the
court.
we
will
be
--
within
the
ambit
of
42
u.s.c.
1983.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
there
was
a
conflict
of
testimony
on
this
point.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
it
is
our
position
that
whether
he
sought
--
either
that
interpretation
or
if
he
became
an
aggressor
or
is
it
a
matter
of
self-defense,
it
doesn’t
matter,
because
he
did
not
attempt
to
act
under
color
of
law
as
it’s
been
defined
by
the
cases
in
this
court.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
the
evidence
was
that
he
was
sitting
in
the
booth
with
a
lady
friend
and
two
other
people.
the
altercation
that
the
fired
into
bar
among
respondents...
mr.
robert
a.
bell
third
parties.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
alright.
first,
the
testimony
was
that
he
said,
well,
i
am
going
to
arrest
three,
no
i
am
going
to
arrest
two
of
the
officers
that’s
part
of
it
in
the
evidence
and
then
he
said,
i
am
going
to
go
to
the
phone
and
call
on-duty
officers,
and
he
never
got…
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
the
matter
of
fact
that
he
sought
to
get
out
the
bar
to
get
to
a
phone,
was
not
an
act
under
color
of
law
that
would
bring
the
respondents
--
they
would
perceive
that
they
were
acting
under
the
color
of
law
and
that
they
were
going
to
be
arrested
or
that
the
petitioner
was
an
officer.
the
act
alone,
to
trying
to
get
out
of
the
bar
to
get
to
the
phone,
does
not
make
him
the
police
officer.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
i
think
he
would
have,
i
think
yes,
sir.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
also
it
could
be
private
activity
if
you
are
going
to
call
the
police
when
you
see
trouble.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
no.
your
honor,
he
was
not
going
to
make
any
arrest,
he
was
going
to
get
help.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
no,
he
stated,
i
was
going
to
arrest
them,
but
by
calling
on-duty
police
officers,
not
himself.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
no.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
i
agree
with
that
but
his
acts
were
not
act.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
he
was
acting,
i
think
your
honor,
more
like
a
policeman
off-duty
who
was
required
as
testified
by
the
chief
of
police
to
take
action.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
rather
that
action
was
to
go
and
call
other
policemen.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
no,
they
are
on-duty
eight
yours
a
day,
on
call
16
hours
a
day.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
no,
you
heard
me
correct.
that
was
the
theory
of
the
purpose
of
carrying
the
weapon
that
they
were
expected
to
be
on-duty,
but
in
fact,
they
were
really
on-duty
eight
hours
a
day,
on
call
16
hours
a
day.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
that
is
correct,
from
his
superiors.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
and
i
will
definitely
acts
of
the
defendant
or
petitioner
were
private
acts,
they
were
not
acts
under
color
of
law.
he
did
not
tend
to
exercise
his
authority
under
the
state,
except
to
go
and
try
and
get
to
the
phone
and
he
never
got
there.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes
sir,
he
could
very
well
and
then
violating
his
oath
as
officer.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
only
in
going
to
get
other
policemen
not
as
to
the
respondents.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes,
he
was...
mr.
robert
a.
bell
yes,
sir.
however,
it
was
not
an
act
as
to
the
respondents.
he
did
not
attempt
to
take
them
into
custody
or
arrest
them
or
in
the
traditional
cases
that
have
been
before
the
court.
may
i
reserve,
mr.
chief
justice,
remaining
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
have
please
the
court.
our
position
is
that
the
question
has
been
preserved
upon
the
motion
filed
in
the
district
court
under
rule
12
(b)
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
was
preserved
throughout
the
trial,
preserved
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
we
feel
that
it
is
still
alive
here
today
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
had
jurisdiction
under
1343.
the
other
remark
that
i
would
like
to
state
that
in
question
to
justice
marshall
as
to
the
petitioner
going
through
the
following,
it
is
our
position
that,
that
act
of
going
to
the
phone
could
have
been
an
act
of
an
individual
or
an
officer
or
person
with
any
sort
of
duty
or
not
as
a
private
individual
could
have
gone
to
the
phone
to
call
police
and
we
feel
that
there
is
something
more
must
take
place
to
bring
this
case
within
the
ambit
and
the
actions
of
this,
of
the
petitioner
within
the
ambit
of
1983.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
showing
his
batch,
telling
them
they
are
under
arrest,
advising
them
to
use
the
police
officer,
seizing
this
list,
the
actions
that
they
were
taking.
mr.
robert
a.
bell
as
far
as
i
know
i
did
but
i…
mr.
robert
a.
bell
i
understand
it,
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
