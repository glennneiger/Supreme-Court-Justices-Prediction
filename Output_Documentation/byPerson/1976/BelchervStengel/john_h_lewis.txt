mr.
john
h.
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
that
mr.
bell
says
is
this
before
the
court
is
not
before
the
court
in
any
reasonable
interpretation,
reasonable
and
accurate
interpretation
of
this
record.
perhaps,
some
of
the
argument
that
advanced
here
should
have
been
advanced
in
more
detail,
imposing
the
petition
through
writ
of
certiorari.
i
think
there
is
not
enough
before
the
court
in
this
record
to
establish
conclusively
that
the
question
that
petitioner
says
is
present
is
not
here
by
any
reasonable
accurate
interpretation
of
the
record.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
certainly,
certainly
to
come
back
to
the
under
the
theory
of
(inaudible)
monroe
v.
pape.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
the
deprivation
of
life
without
due
process
law
seems
to
me
that
the
we
have
…
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
think
that
would
bring
him
to
the
area
of
purely
a
tort?
mr.
john
h.
lewis
yes.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
in
the
situation
of
driving
the
automobile,
the
officer
wouldn’t
be
in
the
process
of
doing
anything
forcing
a
law
or…
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
in
the
tort
situation,
there
was
no
effort
to
enforce
the
law
in
the
driving.
so
that
wasn’t
the
situation
enforcing
a
law.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
officer
was
in
the
process
enforcing
the
law,
one
of
his
duties,
performing
one
of
his
duties.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
i
think
in
our
case,
we
have
intentional
act
we
have
the
under
the
civil
part,
the
civil
section
of
the
civil
rights
act,
the
person
is
presumed
to
do
what
he
--
the
reasonable
result
of
his
act.
here
we
have
a
man
shooting
a
gun,
close
ranged
to
the
vital
parts
of
the
body
of
two
people
that
were
killed;
one
fell
over
shot
of
other.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
no.
i
think
that’s
true,
i
think
the
color
of
law...
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
think
it’s
life
liberty
and
probably
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
i
have
some
trouble
of
words
as
that
situation
meets
the
color
of
law.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
if
you
are
assuming
he
is
acting
under
color
of
law
in
those
fires.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
i
don’t
believe,
i
don’t
know
that
the
case
isn’t
necessarily
going
that
far
that
the
definition
of
the
color
of
law.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
here
we
have
an
officer
that
the
evidence
taken
in
the
most
favorable
like
to
be
complainant
was
in
the
process
of
calling
a
disturbance.
he
entered
into
his
part
of
his
police
duties.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well
i
think
the
distinction
is
something
it
is
a
question
of
a
purely
accidental
occurrence
happened
in
good
phase
and
the
part
in
the
performance
of
duty
and
the
situation
that
we
have
here
shooting
three
people
at
close
range
and
it
is
all
done
and
submitted
to
the
jury
and
there
was
no
justification
and
intentional
is
excessive
force.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
yeah.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
i
think
in
both
instances
if
we
assume
we
are
under
color
of
law
it
is
a
question
of
the
excessive
force
used
under
the
circumstance.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
i
think
that
is
the
thrust
of
monroe
versus
pape
and
the
screws
case,
as
i
understand
that
there
was
an
excessive
force
used.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
do
not
believe
so,
i
think
the
sole
question
that
is
presented
here
is
was
belcher
acting
under
color
of
law
and
was
this
private
conduct
and
all
this
has
been
submitted
by
the
facts
and
the
detailed
facts
of
this
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
of
the
trial
court
was
carefully
instructed
the
jury
to
decide
the
cases
as
this
color
of
law.
the
defense
counsel
used
that
theory
through
out
the
case
including
the
final
argument.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well
it
is
big
argue
and
view
the
fact
that
they
did
not
except
to
the
jury
charges
although
they
are
seem
to
be
coming
in
the
backdoor
now
saying
that
there
is
something
no
matter
was
the
jury
charge
after
the
--
all
the
volume
of
evidence
about
color
of
law
and
its
confined
to
other
things
that
have
not
–
have
not
even
mentioned
yet.
there
is
overwhelming
amount
of
evidence
and
the
record
that
supports
the
color
of
law
theory
that
it
is
not
solely
the
gun
regulation
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
and
stated
that
if
i
could
come
back
to
the
initial
place
of
mr.
bell
started
his
argument.
he
is
again
like
he
has
done
throughout
some
of
the
briefs
and
like
it
is
happened
in
the
other
courts
they
have
taken
part
of
the
facts
here
and
isolated
them
and
not
like
completed
an
accurate
facts
including
their
further
allegation
this
first
complaint.
the
first
crime
related
to
color
of
law
that
you
did
not
read
to
you.
we
stated
that
there
were
other
paragraphs
here
that
were
not
even
mentioned.
now
the
posture
of
this
case
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
that
he
becomes
back
to
this.
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
there
was
a….
there
were
depositions
taken
before
the
court
ruled
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
depositions
taken
of
belcher,
of
course
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
we
had
no
way
of
getting
his
deposition.
at
that
time
mr.
belcher
admitted
used
in
the
deposition,
which
is
before
the
court
and
for
the
district
court
that
he
shot
the
two
men
and
that
he
chase
the
third
man
out
the
door
that
could
fade
or
apprehending.
he
used
the
words
that
indicated
more
than
we
knew
because
we
only
had
one
survivor
what
his
intention
was.
in
addition
to
that
belcher
admitted
at
that
time
that
he
deprived
and
he
had
received
industrial
compensation
for
some
minor
injuries
in
occurrence
of
that
at
the
posture,
the
case
and
before
the
court
had
ruled
on
the
motion
for
to
the
pleadings,
i
filed
the
motion
for
partial
summery
judgment.
on
the
issue
of
color
of
law,
that
settled
the
issue
of
color
of
law.
the
court…
there
was
a
dispute
of
facts
and
the
court,
i
think
properly
overruled
that
motion
at
that
stage
let
the
facts
give
out.
likewise,
we
overrule
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
and
the
inefficient
to
the
complaint
and
i
think
this
was
a
proper
ruling
throughout
the
entire
trial,
the
district
court
allow
the
jury
to
settle
the
disputed
facts
what
happed
and
as
mr.
justice
stevens
says
at
this
point,
the
evidence
has
to
be
considered
that
most
favorable
light
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
those
are
in
the
record.
there
is
a
conflict
of
what
the
officer
set
out
to
do
when
this
relatively
minor
obligation
occurred,
but
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
as
we
got
up
from
his
moves.
he
withdrew
a
mace,
there
was
again
chemical
mace
that
was
again
issued
by
the
city
of
columbus
and
that
he
started
tort
and
spray
these
people
that
were
had
the
altercation,
20
feet
away,
there
is
evidence
to
that
effect
that
was
something
was
issued
to
him
by
the
city
congress
he
did
intervened.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
not
necessarily
what
he
would
do,
he
could
have
used
better
judgment
in
notifying
in
who
he
was,
but
he
was…
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well
probably
not.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
yes.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
right,
right,
absolutely
his
act
and
he
continued
to
act
like
a
policeman.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
very
definitely.
he
use
the
phrase
in
there
he
did
not
want
him
to
get
away.
here
in
one
moment,
he
comes
with
the
story
is
varied
as
the
case
goes
on
it
is
changed
it
around
and
then
he
is
try
to
put
himself
in
some
defense,
but
he
says
here
i
am
defending
myself
on
the
floor,
yet
in
fear
of
my
life,
he
had
seconds
later
in
the
very
small
café
jumps
up,
he
chases
a
man
outside
the
bar
just
trying
to
get
away.
he
slugs
him
with
the
gun
outside.
now
that
certainly
was
not
the
defense
or
was
act
of
a
policeman
to
get
the
other
man,
the
third
man
from
getting
away.
these
are
the
things
that
are
in
the
record
before
the
occurrences
then
we
come
into
the,
what
we
put
in
the
record
afterwards.
the
application
for
compensation,
industrial
compensation
that
he
claims
that
he
is
in
line
of
duty.
we
have
the
finding
of
the
firearms
review
board,
the
statement
of
review
after
reviewed
all
the
investigated
facts
that
this
was
in
line
of
duty.
we
have
the
admissions
by
counsel.
counsel
tried
the
case
on
the
theory
and
tried
to
use
this
as
a
defense
that
he
was
causing
his
defense
with
the
good
works
of
a
police
officer
who
is
trying
to
call
a
disturbance.
we
have
these
arguments
to
the
jury
at
the
end
it
says,
this
is
what
the
officer
had
to
do.
now
after
all
that
evidence
it
is
a
waived
by
jury,
waived
by
court
of
appeals
and
found
to
be
overwhelming
evidence
they
are
back
here
saying,
“well,
we
want
another
shot,
we
want
to
withdraw
the
whole
theory
of
the
case
and
have
a
special
shot
that
we
are
not
under
color
of
law.
we
want
to
come
back
here.”
we
think
they
have
procedurally
waived
everything
that
there
is
--
by
inference
they
are
there
is
something
another
with
the
charged
report
was
not
quite
complete
in
there
for
something
this
kind,
but
yet
they
did
not
object
to
it.
there
was
no
objection
of
charge
throughout.
i
think
the
procedure
we
waived
everything
that
they
are
now
trying
to
bring
before
this
court
to
the
third
time.
they
have
been
cutting
the
facts
here,
leaving
out
the
complete
facts,
presenting
a
case
to
this
court
that
is
not
a
full
and
complete
record
and
that
was
the
reason
that
i
do
not
waive
the
question
that
they
are
trying
to
present
this
before
this
court.
i
think
we
are
still
talking
about
basically
what
perhaps
i
fail
to
adequately
cover
in
opposing
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
question
is
not
here.
now,
that
this
way
(inaudible)
we
were
acting
under
color
of
law,
that
is
all
this
before
the
court.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
that
lawsuit
as
i
recollected
and
i
do
not
remember
i
think
it
was
filed
sector
or
there
was
a
time…
mr.
john
h.
lewis
it
was
filed
after
this
suit
was
filed
here
and
was
filed
against
the
city
of
columbus,
as
i
recollect
that
suit.
it
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case,
but
there
was
a
period
of
time
involving,
i
believe,
they
can't
state
the
cases
where
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity
was
up
in
the
air
in
ohio.
there
was
an
court
of
appeals
decision
in
ohio
that
forcibly
and
very
dramatically
argued
against
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
and
it
was
at
the
part
of
the
case
to
keep
open
a
direct
crime
against
cities,
if
there
was
a
suit
pending
it
had
nothing
was
not
too
extensive
with
this,
who
is
not
in
the
election.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well
he
was
a
plaintiff.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
as
i
remember
that
case
and
it
is
a
long
time,
it
is
not
in
this
record,
as
i
remember
it
was
directed
to
the
city
congress
for
the
purpose
of
taking
advantage
of
the
possible
relaxation
of
the
doctrine
sovereign
immunity,
which
was
up
in
the
air
and
by
decision
of
the
northern
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
ohio.
judge
wrote
a
vary
opinion
that
has
not
been
accepted
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
that
was
what
their
case
was
about.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
yes,
yes
and
it
was
the
dismissed
as
the
law
became
clear
from
ruling
of
the
other
case
and
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
and…
mr.
john
h.
lewis
yes
and
if
i
have
known,
i
could
have
been
better
prepared.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well
i
think
the
court’s
question
comes
to
a
situation
where
you
might
have
purely
private
conduct
that
all
the
evidence
or
the
way
that
the
evidence
looks
the
other
way.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
am
afraid
in
that
situation
we
could
have
facts
if
we
could
argue
over
purely
private
conduct
and
we
would
be
in
the
question
that
they
say
before
the
court
but
those
--
there
is
a
handful
of
facts
that
the…
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
can
see
situations
and
i
suspect
that
is
one
of
them
and
where
there
would
not
be
color
of
law.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
i
think
in
that
situation
you
probably
do
not
have
the
color
of
law...
mr.
john
h.
lewis
yes
i
think
he
would
be.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
life
liberty
and
pursuit
of
help.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
yes.
well,
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
under
color
of
law
in
the
situations
or
district
court
cases
that
say
if
the
uniform
would
not
have
anything
to
do,
instead
of
do
not
think
is
under
color
of
law
in
that
situation
and
it
is
matter
here
that
the
color
of
law
is
a
controlling
thing
before
this
court.
now
that
is
all
before
this
court
as
i
understand
the
motion
it
was
the
sufficient
evidence
in
this
record
that
he
was
acting
under
color
of
law.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
and
i
think
the
record
is
completely
clear
and
any
fairful
interpretation
that
he
was
there
is
a…
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well,
that
is
my
understanding
and
i
have
it.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
detail.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
well
that
1983
claim
…
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
think
it
has
to
be
preserved
with
parties.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
no
i
did
not.
mr.
john
h.
lewis
i
have
indicated
that
they
see
the
case
and
it
was
probably
in
an
adequate
presentation
and
i
think
that,
that
the
things
that
probably
should
have
been
presented
in
the
30
days
over
here.
there
are
now
before
the
court.
i
think
that
--
although
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
request
that
forcibly
because
of
the
incompleteness
of
my
brief.
i
think
there
is
an
amicus
brief
here
that
suggests
that
one
disposition
as
the
whole
thing
that
was
improperly
granted
and
i
do
suggest...
mr.
john
h.
lewis
that
is
true
and
it
is
a
rare
case
that
i
understand
there
are
a
case
or
two
where
on
further,
as
the
court
develops
further
information
about
the
facts
that
there
is
a
determination
of
thing
it
was
improbably
granted,
those
things
to
became
apparent
to
the
court
that
were
not
apparent
to
the
court
when
the
writ
was
granted
and
you
said
that
this
position
that
i
have
suggested
but
i
have
not
suggested
as
forcefully
in
my
brief
is
perhaps
the
solicitor
general
did
because
i
felt
maybe
i
was
not
entitled
to.
i
should
have
presented
more
forcefully
in
my
opposition
of
the
motion
station
for
writ
of
certiorari,
but
i
