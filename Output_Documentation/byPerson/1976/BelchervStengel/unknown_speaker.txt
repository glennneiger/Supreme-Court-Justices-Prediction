unknown
speaker
sometime
at
your
own
convenience,
fit
it
in
wherever
you
wish,
i
would
like
to
have
you
explain
to
me
why
the
conduct
that’s
reflected
by
this
record
of
this
officer
is
any
different
from
what
it
have
been,
had
he
been
specifically
detailed
to
work
overtime
that
he
has
worked
beyond
his
ordinary
workday
or
workweek,
if
you
will
deal
with
that
problem
at
some
point?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
uniformed
officer
might
be
detailed
overtime
work
in
plain
clothes
that’s
not
uncommon
thing
to
do?
unknown
speaker
does
ohio
have
a
tort
claims
act
that
permits
suit
against
municipal
corporations
or
the
state?
unknown
speaker
that
is
still
sovereign
immunity
in
most
areas
in
ohio,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
specifically,
is
columbus
an
area
where
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
applies?
unknown
speaker
either
against
the
municipality
or
what
would
be
the
municipality?
unknown
speaker
against
municipality,
i
mean
the
municipality
would
be
exempt
from
liability
by
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
under
high
laws,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
theory
on
which
the
other
12
officers
were
originally
joined?
unknown
speaker
were
they
in
effect
belcher’s
superiors?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bell,
also
was
there
not
an
enquiry
by
the
police
court
of
enquiry?
unknown
speaker
is
that
initiated
by
the
respondent
or
how
did
that
come
about?
unknown
speaker
i
didn’t
see
complaint
in
the
appendix,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see
that
two
volumes…
unknown
speaker
i
see…
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
shot
into
to
the
air?
unknown
speaker
that
man
over
on
top
of
him?
unknown
speaker
has
there
been
some
change
in
position
by
both
you
and
your
adversary
in
this
case,
mr.
bell,
i
gathered
from
what
the
allegations
you
have
read
in
the
complaint
that
the
suggestion
that
the
police
officer
did
not
ever
assert
who
he
was
and
that
he
never
made
any
attempt
to
make
an
arrest.
10.34
the
further
the
plaintiff’s
cause
and
on
the
other
hand,
i
gather
from
other
material
on
the
record
that
10.42
whoever
defended
the
case
for
mr.
belcher
defended
it
on
the
basis
that
he
was
more
less
acting
in
the
line
of
duty.
unknown
speaker
using
this
clause
and
arguments
too?
unknown
speaker
and
you
really
emphasized
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bell,
there
was
evidence;
the
police
enquiry
board
found
precisely
the
same
thing
and
that
was
evidence,
wasn’t
that?
unknown
speaker
and
was
acting
in
the
line
of
duty.
unknown
speaker
and
was
that
evidence
put
into
the
record
by
the
plaintiff
for
the
defendant?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
supported
the
argument
defense
counsel
made
it
because
of
the
plaintiff’s
case
and
it
closed
the
entire
case
would
it?
wouldn’t
you
put
that
evidence
in?
unknown
speaker
certainly,
would
have
been
consistent
with
this
theory
of
defense
anyway.
unknown
speaker
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
with
that,
your
statement
in
the
closing
argument
by
the
city
of
(inaudible)
bonnie
lawman
related
for
you
a
conversation
that
she
heard
at
the
bar,
between
these
three
people
in
which
one
of
them
said,
“he
is
the
cop”,
is
that
accurate
statement?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
man
you
got
was
no
evidence.
this
mean
there
wasn’t
much?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view
of
the
federal
statute
and
this
complaint,
if
belcher
had
been
in
uniform
and
on-duty
at
that
time
and
place,
what
would
be
the
situation
under
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
was
that?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
all
that
with
the
plaintiff,
that
you
can
see
that
the
plaintiff
would
then
have
had
a
valid
action
under
the
civil
rights
statute?
unknown
speaker
or
would
you
only
have
a
valid
action
if
you
can
show
excessive
force
beyond
anything
necessary?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
why
would
he
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
--
does
1983
talk
about
the
deprivation
of
rights
secured
by
the
federal
constitution
or
law?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
a
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
no,
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
forbid
the
taking
of
life.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
is
pretty
basic
one
in
this
case.
it’s
one
that
wasn’t
even
discussed,
it
was
hardly
discussed
by
either
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
but
why
even
assuming
that
this
was
--
let’s
assume
that
this
policeman,
mr.
belcher,
was
in
uniform
and
on-duty,
and
let's
further
assume
that
everything
happened
the
way
it
did
happen,
why
were
the
victims
of
his
shooting
where
15.41
one
person
was
injured
very
seriously
and
two
were
killed
as
i
understand
it.
why
would
they
have
an
action
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
of
what
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
involves
the
judicial
system.
at
least,
it’s
always
been
thought
to.
we
have
a
case
that’s
going
to
be
argued
and
i
guess
later
today,
16.23
but
generally
traditionally
that
involved
the
judicial
system
and
the
penal
system,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
alright,
but
let’s
assume
this
is
all
taken
under
color
of
law,
i
have
assumed
that.
unknown
speaker
you
remember,
you
are
representing
mr.
belcher,
you
are
not
on
the
other
side?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
understand
that
but
i
really
don’t
--
let’s
assume
that
policeman
in
uniform,
on-duty
but
not
in
an
emergency;
he
is
just
driving
from
one
station
house
to
another,
drives
with
gross
and
one
negligence
and
strikes
and
kills
somebody,
does
he
has
deprived
that
victim
of
his
gross
and
improper
behavior
of
any
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what’s
a
difference
between
in
that
case
and
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
no,
because
in
each
case,
he
is
acting
under
color
of
law.
now,
your
present
case
i
know
that
you
argue
that
he
would
isn’t,
right,
but
i
am
assuming
that
he
is
in
both
cases,
both
in
the
bar
in
columbus,
ohio
and
hypothetically,
in
uniform
and
on-duty
and
also
on
the
street
in
columbus,
ohio
where
he
just
weaves
and
speeds
and
there
is
no
emergency
and
he
kills
somebody.
now,
why
an
either
case,
is
the
victim
deprived
of
any
right
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution
or
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
what
about
an
officer
in
uniform
approaches
a
bank
and
a
bank
robbery
is
going
and
he
engages
in
a
gunfight
with
the
bank
robbers,
but
inadvertently
shoots
and
kills
one
of
the
customers
or
one
of
the
employees
of
the
bank.
do
you
think
that’s
covered
by
1983?
unknown
speaker
within
the
theory
of
your
case
--
then
the
theory
of
your
case
might
more
appropriately
either
this
man
was,
in
fact,
on-duty
and
engaged
in
the
normal
functioning
of
the
police
under
the
special
instructions
to
carry
gun
at
all
times.
unknown
speaker
mr.
bell,
let
me
get
back
i
mean
if
you
answer
to
justice
stewart’s
question.
you
said
that
in
the
squad
car
incident
which
justice
stewart
hypothesized,
you
felt
that
was
not
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
right.
unknown
speaker
the
information
was
that
you
failed
in
the
bar
case
it
is
a
violation
of
constitutional
right?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
turn
on?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
like
screws?
unknown
speaker
what
screws
said
he
had
to
do
with
an
intent
and
expressed
intent
that
denied
any
right
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
but
the
constitutional
rights
20.54
of
a
state
is
precisely
the
same,
there
wasn’t
the
right
to…
unknown
speaker
the
constitutional
right
of
the
state
in
screws
is
precisely
the
same,
the
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
life
without
due
process
of
law.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
right,
you
started
i
think
at
the
outset
of
your
statement
of
the
case,
mr.
bell,
by
telling
us
that
a
companion
suit
had
been
filed
in
the
franklin
county
court
of
common
pleas.
unknown
speaker
then
what
happened
to
that
suit?
unknown
speaker
dismissed
by
the
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bell,
you
say
just
the
use
of
the
private
weapon,
but
does
the
record
tell
us
why
the
defendant
became
involved
in
the
incident?
his
motivation,
was
it
a
private
motivation
or
an
effort
to
maintain
the
peace?
unknown
speaker
if
we
take
these
evidence
most
favorably
to
the
verdict,
do
we
not
have
to
assume
that
he
thought
to
bright
about
peace
and
therefore
perform
his
duties
as
an
officer?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
theory
of
what
he
was
trying
to
do
when
he
got
involved?
unknown
speaker
between
the
plaintiffs
and
third
party?
unknown
speaker
and
why
did
he
get
involved?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
true
that
both
of
those
statements
are
inconsistent
with
the
purely
private
motivation
and
do
they
not
add
to
the
evidence
of
the
gun,
so
can
you
properly
say
there
is
nothing
with
the
gun
involved
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
that
act
alone
have
done
the
most
sensible
thing
to
do
if
he
had
been
in
uniform,
on-duty
to
call
for
some
backup
help?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
that’s
consistent
with
what
your
response
was
to
justice
stevens
which
adds
up
to
me
that
he
was
engaged
in
police
activity.
unknown
speaker
why
this
is,
25.53
to
arrest
him?
do
you
think
he
was
going
to
make
a
private
arrest?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
first
said
he
was
going
to
arrest
one
or
two
of
them.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
arrest
is
not
private,
that
word
26.15
does
not
private
word.
unknown
speaker
‘arrest’
is
not
a
private
word.
unknown
speaker
so,
he
was
acting
as
a
policeman?
well,
let's
put
it
this
way,
he
was
acting
as
a
policeman
in
plain
clothes?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
then
how
could
it
be
off-duty?
i
thought
you
said
he
was
on-duty
24
hours
a
day.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
said
the
reason
they
carry
the
gun
is
because
they
considered
to
be
on-duty
24
hours
a
day,
i
heard
you
wrong?
unknown
speaker
they
were
expected
to
be
on-duty
and
so
he
was
acting
as
a
police
officer,
out
of
uniform,
off
of
official
duty
but
assumed
to
be
on-duty?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
an
under
color
of
law.
unknown
speaker
if
he
had
said
that
the
things
seems
to
be
disturbed
and
do
nothing
about
it,
would
he
be
violating
his
oath
of
officer
as
policemen?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
can
he
was
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
did
all
the
trouble
come,
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
get
a
policemen?
unknown
speaker
which
was
a
policeman’s
act?
unknown
speaker
mr.
general
lewis.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
lewis,
if
this
man,
the
petitioner
here,
belcher
--
i
will
repeat
the
same
question,
i
put
your
friend,
had
been
on-duty
in
his
uniform
and
everything
else
had
occurred
just
as
this
record
shows
it,
would
you
have
an
action
under
1983?
unknown
speaker
well
that
involved
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
on
unreasonable
search
and
seizer
that
which
is
--
i
guess
which
everybody
is
fairly
protected
by
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments,
but
what
constitutional
provisions
are
involved
here,
what
constitutional
protection?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
be
true
then
the
hypothetical
case
of
the
grossly
negligent
policeman
driving
on-duty
not
on
an
emergency,
strikes
somebody
and
kills
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
subjected
to
a
tort
also,
they
are
both
tort?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
doesn’t
answer
the
question,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well
he
would
be
on-duty
and
on-duty
officer
going
from
one
station
and
also
to
another
and
that’s
assume
he
is
corroding
down
as
straight
at
90
miles
an
hour
and
strikes
and
kill
somebody,
that
person
clearly
has
the
a
tort
action
but
as
he
been
deprived
as
the
victim
being
deprived
of
any
rights
secured
to
him
by
the
federal
constitution
and
our
federal
law
and
if
so
--
right?
unknown
speaker
really
--
let's
assume
it
was
the
duty
of
my
hypothetical
policeman
to
go
from
one
station
house
to
another,
and
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
duty,
in
uniform,
in
a
police
car,
on-duty,
what’s
the
difference
between
the
two
cases?
unknown
speaker
the
constitution
doesn’t
say
anything
that
differentiates
an
injury
caused
by
somebody
at
close
range
with
a
pistol
as
contrasted
with
one
caused
by
occurring
in
automobile.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
making
that
sort
of
differentiation,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
let’s
conceive
that
you
are
correct
about
color
of
law,
about
that
he
is
acting
under
color
of
law.
now
then
my
question
goes
beyond
that
and
which
is
simply
what
rights
or
liberties
protected
by
federal
law
or
the
federal
constitution
were
denied
the
victim?
unknown
speaker
how
would
that
equally
be
true
in
case
of
the
grossly
negligent
driver,
if
you
are
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
am
assuming
the
policeman
is
acting
under
color
of
law,
in
both
cases
in
my
question.
unknown
speaker
the
policeman
in
uniform,
on-duty
going
from
one
station
house
to
another
is
acting
under
color
of
law,
--
we
are
clear
about
that,
could
we?
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
policeman
will
serves
the
bank
robbery,
seize
someone
fleeing
who
has
reasonable
cause
to
think
rob
the
bank,
shoots
at
the
person
and
kills
him
and
say
it
takes
place
in
ohio
and
ohio
says
that
its
justifiable
for
an
officer
in
that
position
to
shoot
a
fleeing
fellow.
if
it
turns
out
and
he
was
mistaken
as
to
that
person,
does
that
person
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
1983?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
different
from
your
case?
unknown
speaker
well
so
in
my
case,
certainly
no
one
could
be
more
in
the
performance
of
his
police
duties
than
in
uniform
having
just
witnessed
a
bank
robbery
and
trying
to
prevent
an
escaping
fellow,
someone
who
we
thought
was
an
escaping
fellow.
unknown
speaker
well,
my
hypothetical,
the
man
is
much
more
arguably
in
the
course
of
duty
then
than
in
your
case
is
that
not?
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
it
that
would
lead
you
to
say,
in
my
case
you
do
not
have
a
claim
under
the
1983,
but
in
yours
you
do?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
constitution
distinguished
on
the
basis
of
excessive
force?
unknown
speaker
screws
was
someone
in
custody
in
a
jail
and
beaten
to
death,
whether
or
not.
monroe
was
forth
amendment
violation,
so
you
never
had
to
go
to
just
the
procedural
of
guaranties
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lewis,
let
me
ask
you
two
questions
and
i
think
maybe
relevant
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
inquiry,
supposing
that
facts
that
shown
that
the
officer
said
to
the
deceiving
before
he
shot
in.
i
do
not
think
you
need
a
trial,
or
take
care
all
things
without
always
judicial
process.
we
will
get
things
done
in
a
hurry,
i
would
suppose
that
would
support
a
claim
amended
in
the
denied
due
process
of
law
and
i
think
that
you
would
agree
with
that,
would
you
not?
now,
the
second
question
i
would
like
to
ask
is,
does
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
raised
any
issues
whatsoever
with
respect
to
whether
it
has
to
be
negligence
deliberate
intent
such
as
i
raised
or
any
of
these
different
hypothetical
cases,
is
that
before
us
today?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
jury
instructions
before
us?
we
have
to
assume
that
jury
was
property
instructed
under
the
nature
of
the
violation
was?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lewis,
at
which
point
you
say
point
to
on
the
color
stated
forth,
that
are
in
the
record
of
course?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying
that
just
where
the
policeman
majority
were
on-duty
and
uniform?
unknown
speaker
well
if
he
had
a
uniform,
would
that
be
necessary?
unknown
speaker
would
not
it
be
sensible
to
use
of
the
mace
first
instead
of
the
automatic?
unknown
speaker
so
up
to
this
point
except
for
the
uniform,
he
is
acting
just
like
a
policeman?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
the
pursuit
of
the
third
man
was
also
acting
like
a
policeman?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
lewis,
why
did
you
dismiss
your
–
most
of
issues
filed
in
the
franklin
county
court
of
common
pleas?
unknown
speaker
it
was
filed
when?
unknown
speaker
mr.
stengel
was
not
a
defendant
in
that
suit
as
you
remember?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
mr.
belcher
was
not
a
defendant,
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
you
filed
that
case?
you
were
the
attorney?
unknown
speaker
well
it
would
be
matter
of
public
record?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lewis
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
case
is
here,
as
presented
by
the
petition,
does
your
position
depend
on
the
intent
of
the
officer
at
that
time
he
participated
in
this
fray?
i
put
that
for
another
question
too
that
may
sharpen
it
little
bit
suppose
instead
of
his
having
said
according
to
some
of
the
testimony
that
he
was
going
to
arrest
these
people
to
tend
his
girlfriend
and
said,
“this
look
like
a
good
fight.
i
think
i
will
get
into
it,”
and
it
moved
from
there
into
what
happened
would
you
have
case
there?
unknown
speaker
putting
hypothetical
case
to
you,
that
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
his
intention
beyond
the
statement
he
made
to
his
girlfriend,
“it
looks
like
a
great
fight.
i
think
i
will
get
into
it”.
he
did
and
ended
up
shooting
two
people
with
his
service
revolver
and
using
his
mace.
unknown
speaker
if
the
facts
have
been
and
not
stated
and
you
think
there
be
no
color
of
law?
unknown
speaker
let
us
assume
taking
mr.
justice
powell’s
hypothetical
assuming
that
this
policeman
is
in
uniform
and
on-duty
and
stopped
by
a
bar
to
see
how
one
of
constituencies
have
been
along
and
everything
else
happened,
as
did
happen
here
but
he
was
in
uniform
and
on-duty,
but
he
said
to
his
girlfriend
and
to
the
bartender,
“this
looks
like
a
good
fight,
i
think
i
will
get
into
it,”
and
then
with
the
results
describe
by
mr.
justice
powell,
which
is
the
same
results
here
two
people
killed
and
one
injured,
where
those
who
have
been
denied
any
constitutional
rights?
unknown
speaker
well
i
am
assuming
there
is
color
of
law…
i
am
assuming
he
is
in
uniform
and
on-duty.
unknown
speaker
what
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
constitution
does
not
guarantee
the
pursuit
of
happiness
that
is
in
the
declaration
of
independent
and
so
far
as
life
and
liberty
goes,
it
does
not
guarantee
those
either.
it
just
guaranties
that
nobody
should
be
deprived
of
them
without
due
process
of
law
by
a
state.
unknown
speaker
you
can
assume
it
under
this
question,
you
can
assume
that
he
is
acting
under
color
of
law
because
the
question
is,
whether
they
are
acting
under
color
of
law
or
not
that
is
the
question.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
reports.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
discussion
in
judge
white’s
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
what
federally
protected
right
was
invaded
here?
i
know
he
mentions
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
protection
clause
as
they
are
just
mentioned,
is
there
any
discussion?
unknown
speaker
was
that
brief
you
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
basis
for
your
claim
in…
well
what
was
the
jurisdictional
statute
that
you
relied
on
and
filing
your
claimant
the
federal
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well
1983
does
not
by
its
terms
comparing,
was
the
1343
the
section
it
says,
if
you
state
a
claim
under
1983
the
federal
courts
or
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
your
complaint
as
i
remember
it
jurisdictionally
relayed
on
both
the
section
1343
and
section
1331.
i
think
just
saw
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
lewis,
if
you
are
going
to
district
court
and
say,
my
claim
arises
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
because
it
is
under
1331
and
your
case
is
try
to
jury
and
so
forth
is
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
question
is
that
a
jurisdictional
question
so
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned?
is
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
it
can
be
raised
at
anytime,
or
is
that
the
thing
that
has
to
be
preserved
by
the
party?
unknown
speaker
because
federal
courts
are
not
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
they
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction
and
the
court
is
always
to
free
to
examine
its
own
jurisdiction
you
would
agree
with
those
propositions
would
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lewis,
you
are
making
a
fair
and
persuasive
argument
that
the
petition
states
a
question
that
is
quite
different
from
the
theory
on
which
the
case
was
represented
below,
did
you
file
more
than
one
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
that
is
a
briefing.
unknown
speaker
amicus
brief
was
not
filed
until
august
after
we
had
granted
the
petition,
we
did
not
have
very
much
in
liking
the…
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
about
two
minutes.
unknown
speaker
like
what?
unknown
speaker
and
the
act
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
know
what
i
mean,
i
cannot
assume
we
have
it?
i
have
a
great
difficulty
going
outside
the
record.
