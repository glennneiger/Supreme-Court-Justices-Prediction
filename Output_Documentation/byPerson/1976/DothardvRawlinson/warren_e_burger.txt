we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
dothard
against
mieth.
mr.
evans
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
ms.
horowitz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
court
could
not
take
judicial
notice
of
the
proposition
of
the
heights
and
weights
size
as
a
direct
relationship
defining
the
functions
of
the
prison’s
guards.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
court
can
do
it
too,
can’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn’t
that
traditional
and
usual
line
drawing
process
as
to
which
we
have
said
many,
many
times
that
any
such
line
invariably
excludes
some
that
might
well
be
included
and
includes
some
that
might
properly
be
excluded.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
griggs
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
kind
of
a
job
requirement.
what
if
they
had
said
100
pounds
and
4’8”
that
would
be
alright,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
am
thinking
of
the
regulation.
in
the
first
instance,
the
state
needs
no
proof.
it
is
subjective
decision
based
upon
general
experience,
and
suppose
they
say
4’8”
and
100
pounds,
would
you
have
any
quarrel
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
they
have
made
a
regulation,
no
proof
involved;
you
do
not
need
any
proof
to
make
a
regulation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about;
you
would
not
have
any
quarrel.
so,
the
issue
is
all
itself
drew
a
line
that
you
do
not
like
as
compared
to
the
line
that
you
would
find
acceptable.
they
have
drawn
the
wrong
line.
that
is
your
case,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
4’8”
and
100
pounds
this
would
be
just
as
arbitrary,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
us
pursue
your
other
proposition.
the
4’8”
and
100
pounds
would
not
exclude
all
the
women
that
you
have
been
concerned
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
brings
us
around
the
circle
again.
the
state
can
draw
a
line,
4’8”
and
100
pounds
would
be
a
tolerable
line,
but
5’2”
and
120
is
unacceptable
line
because
of
its
exclusionary
operative
effect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
undertake
to
show
how
many
inside
guards
in
contract
decisions
in
the
federal
system
work,
under
120
and
5
feet
2
or
4
whatever
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn’t
then
title
vii
quite
relevant
if
you
not
stand
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
evans,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
in
76-422,
dothard
against
rawlinson
will
also
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
