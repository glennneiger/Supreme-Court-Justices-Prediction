mr.
g.
daniel
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
danny
evans,
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
alabama,
counsel
for
the
appellants.
my
co-counsel
with
me
is
today
is
mr.
eric
bowen,
also
of
our
attorneys
general’s
office.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
basically
these:
this
case
presents
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
ruling
of
the
middle
district
of
alabama
striking
down
both
the
state
statute
and
an
administrative
regulation.
the
case
started
as
two
consolidated
class
actions,
both
challenging
different
areas
of
alabama
law
on
constitutional
grounds,
as
well
as
statutory
grounds
under
title
vii.
this
appeal
pertains
only
to
the
part
of
the
order
would
struck
down
a
height/weight
requirement
and
a
prison
regulation.
the
class
that
is
affected
by
this
order
challenged
a
5
foot
2,
120
pound,
minimum
height/weight
requirement
that
is
included
in
an
alabama
statute
for
law
enforcement
officers
included,
under
that
statute,
our
prison
guards.
the
action
also
challenged,
although
the
plaintiff
representative
was
not
an
employee,
an
administrative
regulation
of
the
alabama
board
of
correction
which
prevented
guards
of
opposite
sections
working
in
contact
position
within
penitentiaries
in
alabama
with
inmates
of
opposite
sections.
the
court
below
found
in
regard
to
the
statute
that
the
height/weight
minimums
on
the
basis
of
1960
statistical
survey
have
a
disproportional
impact
on
women,
and
in
that
regard
and
on
that
basis
solely
they
we
found
it
to
be
a
prima
facie
discriminatory
under
title
vii
and
enjoined
its
further
application.
in
regard
to
the
regulation
the
court
made
no
finding
of
the
prima
facie
showing
of
discrimination
but
merely
present
it
to
be
discriminatory
and
evidently,
explicitly
due
to
its
application
of
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
of
the
defense.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
no
sir
you
do
not.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
all,
your
honor,
just
exactly
that,
and
that
is
one
of
the
grievances
we
bring
to
this
court
is
that
the
court
look
to
merely
14-year
old
statistics
representing
women
between
the
ages
of
18
and
79
in
alabama.
now,
certainly
they
could
affect
judicial
knowledge
of
those
facts.
there
was
no
restriction
--
you
will
found
this
on
page
32
of
the
jurisdiction
statement
--
there
is
no
restriction
as
to
the
number
of
age
brackets
that
would
even
be
considered
for
the
job
or
the
number
of
the
people
which
worked
actually
in
the
labor
market
itself,
and
certainly
there
was
no
finding
as
to
the
applicants,
as
this
court
stated
it
should
be
in
albemarle.
now,
there
are
several
issues
before
the
court
by
this
appeal
but
due
to
the
time
limitations
i
intend
to
address
only
three.
from
notification
of
the
clerk
he
indicated
that
the
court
would
be
interested
in
hearing
a
jurisdictional
issue
on
the
providence
of
this
appeals
as
the
outset.
now,
certainly
the
court
knows
that
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
on
november
29
but
since
at
time
the
afl-cio
filed
an
amicus
brief
challenging
some
aspects
of
jurisdiction,
and
we
are
prepared
to
argue
that
today.
second
issue,
and
we
contend
should
be
addressed
by
the
court,
is
the
applicability
of
title
vii
to
the
states.
in
addition
to
that
issue
we
intend
to
argue
to
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
a
prison
guard
in
the
all
male
prison
or
all
female
prison
with
regard
to
the
opposite
sex.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
no
your
honor,
this
appeal
pertains
only
to
the
prison
guard
classification.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
the
two
issue
that
in
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
yes
your
honor.
returning
to
the
first
issue
of
jurisdiction
and
the
providence
of
this
appeal
tell
us
contend
a
course
that
the
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
properly
on
november
29th.
the
grievance
of
the
afl-cio
as
amicus
is
that
basically
since
title
vii
which
he
used
as
the
grounds
for
the
part
of
the
order
and
since
it
could
have
been
used
under
their
assumptions
or
the
entirety
of
the
order
then
the
case
should
not
properly
be
here
as
no
constitutional
finding
was
made
by
the
court
below.
at
the
outset
we
would
point
out
the
key
facts
of
the
case.
the
complaint
of
the
consolidated
class
action
challenged
alabama
statutes
and
regulations
on
statutory
and
constitutional
grounds.
every
statute
that
was
brought
in
was
challenged
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
three-judge
court
ordered
that
pertaining
to
the
highway
troopers
which
is
not
before
us
was
based
solely
on
constitutional
grounds,
was
a
complete
1983
action
having
nothing
to
do
with
title
vii.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
seems
to
be
indicated
rather
record,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
not,
that
is
not
there.
that
was
before
the
court
when
its
decision
to
convene
a
three-judge
panel,
was
made.
also
in
pertaining
to
this
appeal
the
regulation
which
was
enjoined
was
enjoined
on
both
title
vii
and
constitutional
grounds,
and
the
statute
which
was
enjoined
have
a
constitutional
allegation
to
it
and
we
feel
certain
that
the
court
made
that
allegation
from
these
facts.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
in
effect
your
honor,
that
is
their
argument
that
the
title
vii
allegation
makes
insubstantial
allegation
of
constitutionality.
now,
we
feel
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
we
feel
that
for
several
reasons
including
our
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
application
of
the
states
of
title
vii.
we
feel
that
is
inappropriate
logic
especially
dealing
with
the
providence
of
an
appeal
and
previous
cases
of
this
court
held
that
the
substantial
constitutional
questions
are
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
a
three-judge
court
should
be
convened.
furthermore
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
i
certainly
help
not
your
honor.
we
contend
that
it
was
not
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
well,
the
following
facts
i
believe
do.
the
merits
of
the
claim
were
reached
in
this
case
too,
and
in
fact
one
of
the
statutes
was
enjoined
explicitly
on
the
basis
of
constitutionality
as
well
as
a
statutory
question,
and
we
feel
it
would
be
improper
for
the
court
to
ignore
that
determination.
we
also
feel
that
that
would
be
improper
for
the
court
to
feel
that
a
title
vii
allegation
makes
insubstantial
allegation
of
denial
of
the
equal
protection.
this
court
recently
in
philbrook
versus
glodgett
found
that
even
if
a
court
is
properly
convened
and
reaches
the
merits
of
the
case,
even
if
the
final
ruling
is
based
totally
on
statutory
grounds
then
that
case
should
be
on
the
direct
appeal
to
this
court,
and
we
feel
that
it
is
properly
lie
here.
the
allegation
that
title
vii
makes
insubstantial,
the
constitutional
allegation,
we
feel
is
remiss
with
many
interpretations
of
the
three-judge
appeal.
hagens
v.
lavine
a
recent
case
by
this
court
indicated
that
that
would
be
the
most
judicial
efficienct
with
method
of
dealing
with
the
--
statutory
and
constitutional
claim
were
presented
for
the
single
judge
to
take
the
statutory
claim,
decide
it,
then
take
the
constitutional
claim
if
necessary
and
convene
a
three-judge
court.
now,
the
several
problems
we
see
with
that
type
of
method
--
but
at
outset
i
would
point
out
in
this
particular
case
dealing
with
equal
protection
and
dealing
with
a
title
vii
equal
employment
claim,
the
gravenment
of
the
complaint
in
each
is
identical.
the
method
of
proof
in
both
will
be
very
similar.
the
judicial
efficiency
therefore
in
that
regard
would
be
almost
nil
of
requiring
that
one
judge
to
determine
a
statutory
claim
and
then
possibly
changing
the
rate
of
an
appeal
for
one
party
and
then
reconvening
a
three-judge
panel.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
one
blatant
flaw
we
see
in
that
your
honor
is
that
if
the
plaintiff
does
prevail
on
the
statutory
claim
and
the
constitutional
claim
is
never
met
then
the
defendant,
if
it
should
appeal,
has
to
go
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
if
the
plaintiff
does
in
fact
fail
on
the
statutory
claim
the
court
finds
that
the
constitutional
questions
are
still
viable
convenes
a
three-judge
court
and
a
direct
appeal
allows
to
this
court.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
so,
about
adjoining
an
allegation
constitutionality
and
a
statutory
claim
the
plaintiff
is
assured
of
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
whereas
the
defendant
would
not
be,
and
we
feel
that
that
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
the
defendant
and
certainly
an
improvident
interpretation
of
section
1253.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
if
the
merits
are
met,
standing
is
proper
and
so
forth,
it
would
lie
here.
we
feel
however
though
that
that
are
constitutional
challenge
to
title
vii
and
its
application
to
the
state
is
a
significance
in
reaching
the
minutes
of
even
the
insubstantial,
substantial
argument
regarding
title
vii
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
no,
your
honor
it
was
not,
it
was
not
made
below
nor
was
it
included
specifically
in
our
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
for
the
simple
fact
that
a
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
we
feel
that
the
issue
should
be
decided
by
this
court
for
the
simple
fact
that
it
has
crucial
bearing
on
the
subject-matter
jurisdiction
of
this
case,
and
certainly
if
it
is
unconstitutional
as
we
contend
that
it
is
then
it
would
destroy
any
insubstantial
argument
of
the
constitutional
claim.
returning
to
that
allegation
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
well,
your
honor
in
philbrook
versus
glodgett
the
court
i
think
through
justice
rehnquist
specifically
stated
that
they
would
not
consider
locomotive
engineers
versus
chicago
rock
island,
where
it
was
specifically
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
yes
your
honor
and
we
contend
that
does
support
the
jurisdiction
here.
i
would
feel
that
that
does
support
the
jurisdiction
but
turning
to
the
constitutional
question
which
i
feel
is
properly
before
the
court.
it
is
basically
our
argument
that
the
1972
amendments
of
title
vii
pose
an
unconstitutional
abridgement
of
state’s
rights
under
the
tenth
amendment,
as
well
as
an
unwarranted
extension
of
the
congressional
power.
at
the
outset
title
vii
was
justified
on
the
commerce
clause
as
the
court,
i
am
certain
familiar
with.
in
1972
there
was
a
post
grip(ph)
application
including
all
state
activities
within
its
coverage.
there
was
no
definition
of
the
state
activities
in
such
commerce
even
in
the
most
incidental
fashion.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
your
honor,
we
raise
it
here
on
the
basis
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction
and
certainly
the
counterclaim
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
well,
certainly
if
title
vii
is
to
be
used
as
the
basis
for
declaring
unconstitutional
a
statute
and
a
regulation
of
the
state
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
or
declaring
volitive
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
if
it
is
to
be
used
as
that
basis,
certainly
its
constitutionality
must
be
established,
and
if
it
is
not
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
in
a
sentence.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
well,
you
certainly
challenge
the
subject-matter
of
jurisdiction
and
of
course
as
i
am
sure
you
are
aware
that
that
can
be
raised
at
in
point.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
it
our
contention
basically
your
honor
that
if
the
court
below
was
to
use
a
vehicle
of
title
vii
to
declare
unconstitutional
or
declare
volitive
a
state
statute
and
regulation
of
alabama.
it
would
be
without
subject-matter
jurisdiction
to
do
that
if
that
statutory
vehicle,
i.e.
title
vii
was
itself
on
that.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
yes
your
honor,
and
we
feel
that
those
claim,
on
the
basis
of
facts,
should
be
denied
too,
but
here
the
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional
specifically
on
the
basis
of
title
vii.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
yes
your
honor,
but
if
that
--
we
urge
that
if
that
is
to
be
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
title
vii
must
also
be
examined
to
find
out
that
the
court
had
subject-matter
jurisdiction
for
the
same
allegation.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
pertaining
to
the
constitutional
claim
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
we
feel
that
it
would
in
the
fact
that
the
court
would
be
without
jurisdiction,
even
entertain
those
allegations…
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
no
your
honor,
certainly
not.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
by
simple
fact
that
the
allegations
and
the
basis
of
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
were
based
on
that
statute.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
well,
your
honor,
i
will
certainly
proceed
with
other
arguments
in
that
case,
but
we
do
earnestly
contend
that
that
is
a
viable
issue
before
the
court
and
that
it
has
been
briefed
and
the
solicitor
general
has
been
notified
of
it.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
i
will
proceed
directly
there
your
honor.
now,
the
third
issue
which
i
intended
to
address
today
deals
with
the
providence
of
a
finding
of
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
for
contact
positions
within
penitentiaries
only
in
alabama.
at
outset
as
we
have
just
argued,
we
feel
that
title
vii
is
inapplicable.
however,
the
factual
considerations
that
would
uphold
it
under
equal
protection
analysis
and
under
title
vii,
we
feel
would
justify
as
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
the
court
below
found
it
volitive
of
both,
equal
protection
and
the
title
vii.
nevertheless
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
title
vii
is
applicable
and
should
also
find
as
the
court
below
evidently
assume
that
it
is
prima
facie
discriminatory,
we
feel
that
the
facts
below
justify
the
defense
with
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
we
do
not
urge
a
broad
reason
of
the
statute,
many
of
the
amicus
have
challenged
that,
we
do
not
urge
that
it
effaced
a
very
purpose
of
the
statute
and
we
do
not
challenge
the
good
intent
of
the
congress
in
this
regard.
but
if
the
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
is
to
be
given
anything
more
than
an
imaginary
existence,
certainly
the
facts
of
this
case
warranted.
the
facts
surrounding
the
regulation
are
these:
the
regulation
was
promulgated
by
the
board
of
corrections
of
alabama
only
after
the
solicited
advice
of
the
general
counsel
for
the
eeoc.
it
is
not
arbitrary,
it
does
not
just
leave,
get
up
to
the
open
discretion,
sets
forth
several
criteria
to
be
used
in
determining
whether
a
contact
position
within
a
penitentiary
should
be
subject
to
requiring
a
guard
of
alike
sex
with
inmates.
it
is
limited
only
to
contact
positions
and
limited
only
to
penitentiaries.
alabama
penitentiaries
are
unique
in
their
selves
as
i
am
sure
the
all
penitentiaries
within
each
state,
and
certainly
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
the
contact
position
in
alabama
your
honor,
within
the
brief
on
page
50
they
are
laid
out,
they
have
certain
five
criteria
that
deal
with
the
position
--
that
define
it
as
a
regulation
be
it
basically
whether
they
would
be
in
direct
contact
with
inmates
of
opposite
sex
without
anyone
else
around
and
requiring
invasions
of
privacy,
no
other
protection
so
forth
as
that.
now,
in
reference
to
the
justifiability
of
this
particular
regulation,
we
would
point
out
some
peculiarities
about
alabama
system.
the
penitentiaries
in
alabama
are
open
dormitories,
they
are
not
single
cell
occupied,
they
have
open
communal
toilets
to
allow
open
view
into
the
penitentiaries
by
patrolling
guards,
we
have
multiple
offenders
only
in
alabama
penitentiaries,
we
have
other
facilities
that
house
first
offenders
in
use.
20%
of
the
population
are
sex
offenders.
we
have
farming
operation
at,
at
least,
two
of
the
four
facilities
that
require
extensive
strip
searching
and
path
searching
and
guards
are
used
interchangeably
in
all
the
positions
in
the
prison
for
several
reasons
to
promote
their
familiarity
with
institutions
and
also
because
of
the
shortage
of
manpower.
now,
the
state
of
alabama
is
not
intending
any
type
of
discrimination
for
women
in
regard
to
its
use
in
females
or
males
in
contact
positions.
the
state
has
been
using
women
in
minimum
security
institutions
since
1974.
they
have
used
them
in
work-release
centers,
in
youth
facilities,
and
we
have
encountered
several
difficulties
in
those
facilities
but
nevertheless
the
overriding
considerations
of
equal
employment
opportunity,
we
have
used
them
in
those
facilities.
the
board
of
corrections,
it
is
our
contention,
in
promulgating
regulation
204
deals
with
real
contacts.
they
cannot
assume
that
inmates
within
the
state
of
alabama
penitentiaries
view
every
individual
where
equal
protections
lies.
they
are
dealing
with
the
stereotypes
that
are
perceived
by
the
inmates
within
alabama.
they
have
certain
goals
they
must
make
sure
the
institution
are
secured,
they
must
make
sure
have
control
of
it,
they
must
make
sure
that
the
inmates
are
safe
and
that
their
employees
are
safe,
and
these
require
realistic
appraisal
of
the
facts
before
them.
we
feel
that
the
record
below
of
dealing
with
the
commissioner
lott's
deposition
who
is
commissioner
of
our
board
of
corrections,
recognizing
the
sexual
stereotypes,
the
innate
attraction
of
multiple
offenders
who
have
been
long
incarcerated
to
a
female’s
presence
or
vice
versa
are
necessary
and
realistic
concerns,
and
that
these
certainly
justify
the
regulation.
the
evidence
that
was
proposed
to
the
contrary
below
does
little
we
feel
to
impeach
that
the
experts
that
were
testified,
starting
with
mr.
nelson.
mr.
nelson
is
the
director
of
a
minimum
security
institution
in
chicago,
and
that
institution
houses
persons
with
less
than
a
year
to
serve.
they
have
been
using
women
there
for
six
months.
it
is
the
single
cell
institutions.
they
toilets
are
not
communal,
they
are
divided
off
and
the
inmate
staff
ratio
was
considerably
less.
that
primarily
is
the
fact
of
the
type
of
institution
that
we
are
dealing
with.
now,
from
his
six
months
appraisal
he
said
they
have
been
good
that
we
reviews
that
but
he
admitted
that
the
federal
system
of
which
he
is
a
part
does
not
use
women
in
the
penitentiaries
in
contact
positions
and
for
obvious
reason
that
we
feel
are
adequately
proposed
today.
mr.
sarba
(ph)
the
other
expert
before
the
court
below
had
never
supervised
women
in
any
penitentiary,
although
he
had
been
warden
of
two.
he
had
never
known
of
any
such
situation
of
women
being
in
contact
positions
in
penitentiaries,
but
nevertheless
he
was
sure
that
they
would
be
very
capable
and
would
add
to
the
normalization
of
the
prison
system,
but
we
feel
that
this
is
simply
not
credible
evidence
to
impeach
the
correctly
promulgated
regulations
of
the
state.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
they
are
doing
regulation
204
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
regulation
--
mr.
g.
daniel

it
is
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel

that
is
correct
the
regulation
was
cut
down
--
mr.
g.
daniel

it
applies
to
prison
employees,
the
guards.
mr.
g.
daniel

well
your
honor
--
mr.

the
assignments
as
a

counselor
--
this
regulation
was
to
certify
correctional
counselor
--
mr.

daniel

initially
it
did
your
honor,
that
has
been
changed.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
the
trainee
register,
you
have
to
satisfy
the
height
and
weight
requirement.
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
it
deals
with
the
combination
of
sex,
that
is
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
exactly
your
honor.
we
feel
the
court
below
ignored
the
factual
differences
of
the
institution
and
the
experts
testified
about,
and
the
fact
that
alabama
uses
women
in
its
minimum
security
institutions
and
has
longer
than
any
institution
that
was
proposed
by
the
plaintiffs
should
not
found
as
an
inconsistent
position
which
recognizing
factual
differences
between
a
minimum
security
work
release
center
and
a
penitentiary
for
multiple
offenders.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
no,
your
honor,
and
i
did
not
handle
the
case
at
trail,
but
i
challenged
or
would
challenge
here
if
our
plaintiff
would
preserve
the
standing,
they
did
not
even
challenge
the
regulation
204.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
to
decide
their
standing
probably
not
your
honor,
because
the
person
is
not
an
employee.
i
would
not
think
would
have
standing
in
any
case.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
it,
that
is
it
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
then
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would.
if
it
please
the
court
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
a
few
things
to
state.
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
justice
marshall
that
the
prison
in
chicago
is
a
first
offender
institution,
it
is
multiple
offended,
that
what
i
stated,
i
believe
was
that
they
all
have
less
than
a
year
to
serve
and
it
is
single
cell
and
so
forth.
the
state
did
try
to
make
selective
work
responsibility.
that
was
a
whole
promulgation,
the
whole
reason
behind
regulation
204
is
to
assign
women
in
male
prisons
where
they
could
be
used
and
still
meet
the
needs
of
the
state
and
to
assign
males
in
the
women
prisons
where
they
could
be
used.
now,
we
use
them
in
the
youth
centers
and
in
the
work
release
centers.
as
our
youth
centers,
the
boys
or
first
offenders,
non
valid
inmates
have
got
less
than
ten
years
to
serve,
and
they
are
going
to
school
during
the
day.
at
the
work
release
centers,
all
the
inmates
are
gone
during
the
day
to
jobs.
there
is
certainly
no
patrolling
situation
like
here
in
the
penitentiaries.
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
prima
facie
showing
against
the
height
and
weight
statute.
the
only
thing
was
shown
in
this
case
was
some
census
figures
that
were
taken
in
1960
about
women
between
the
ages
of
18
and
79.
there
was
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
show
women
in
the
alabama
workforce,
they
were
eligible
for
employment
as
prison
guards,
no
attempt
whatsoever.
we
feel
that
the
court
could
have
taken
judicial
knowledge
of
this
and
this
is
certainly
not
sufficient
to
show
and
the
challenge
to
the
state
statute
is
being
prima
facie
discriminatory.
in
griggs
the
court
did
find
a
statistical
disparity
plus
a
past
practice
of
over
racial
discrimination
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
we
do
not
have
any
past
practice
here,
we
do
not
have
any
over
discrimination
in
the
past,
there
is
nothing
shown
by
some
census
figures,
and
we
certainly
contend
that
the
griggs
decision
is
limited
by
those
circumstances.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
1971
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
well,
your
honor
we
contend
that
they
are
not
that
widely
known
because
obviously
the
plaintiff
representative
in
this
case
had
a
masters
degree
in
criminals
psychology
proposed
to
have
some
law
enforcement
experience
and
had
no
idea
that
there
was
such
a
height
and
weight
minimum.
justice
marshall
questioned
earlier
about
the
widespread
use
of
these
things.
a
lawyer
view
article
which
we
cited
in
brief,
there
had
been
some
investigation
of
that
and
found
that
47
of
the
50
largest
police
forces
is
in
the
country
do
use
those,
and
we
are
unaware
of
any
state
troop
force
in
the
country
that
does
not
use
some
type
of
height/weight
requirement.
as
far
as
drawing
the
line
which
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
mentioned
earlier,
this
job
is
not
like
an
airline
job
where
you
can
tell
if
the
person
is
so
many
inches
long
then
he
can
reach
to
the
paddles
in
the
controls.
this
is
a
job
which
has
a
peculiar
function,
the
duties
are
unpredictable,
there
is
high
risk
involved
and
there
in
a
maximum
amount
of
state
responsibility
both
to
the
inmates
as
well
as
the
population
which
surrounds
the
prisons,
and
the
whole
of
the
state
is
such
a
rigid
standard
or
to
a
mathematical
certainty
to
have
to
say
that
a
person
5’2”,
120
pounds
can
always
do
the
job,
whereas
a
person
5’2”
115
pounds
can
never
do
the
job,
we
feel
that
is
certainly
unjustified
and
in
a
derogation
of
the
tenth
amendment.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
they
carry
knife
sticks,
or
if
they
are
sticks
--
mr.
g.
daniel
evans
that
is
all
your
honor,
and
of
course
they
are
minority.
my
time
is
expired.
thank
you.
