justice
potter
stewart
this
case
comes
to
us
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
the
appellee,
dianne
rawlinson
sought
employment
as
a
prison
guard
with
the
alabama
board
of
corrections
and
her
application
for
employment
and
that
job
was
rejected.
she
then
brought
this
class
suit
alleging
that
she
had
been
denied
employment
because
of
her
sex
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
amended.
the
board
of
corrections
follows
two
employment
policies
that
the
district
court
concluded
do
violate
title
vii.
by
statute,
alabama
requires
that
every
prison
guard
must
be
at
least
5’2”
tall
and
weigh
at
least
120
pounds.
the
district
court
found
that
the
statutory
criteria
disproportionately
exclude
women
from
employment
and
that
the
state
had
failed
to
offer
any
evidence
that
the
height
and
weight
standards
are
job-related.
secondly,
by
an
official
regulation,
the
state
has
established
a
policy
of
not
hiring
any
women
as
guards
in
so-called
contact
positions
in
all
male
maximum
security
penitentiaries,
whatever
the
height
or
weight
of
the
women
guards
might
be.
the
district
court
held
that
these
regulations
explicit
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
was
not
justified
under
the
bona-fide-occupational-qualification
exception
contained
in
title
vii.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirmed
the
district
court's
invalidation
of
the
height
and
weight
requirements
but
reversed
its
invalidation
of
the
official
regulation.
the
district
court
properly
relied
on
national
height
and
weight
statistics
showing
that
41%
of
the
female
population
and
less
than
1%
of
the
male
population
would
be
excluded
from
any
prison
guard
employment
under
alabama
statutory
height
and
weight
standards.
the
state
failed
to
rebut
this
prima
facie
case
by
demonstrating
either
deficiencies
in
the
statistical
data
or
that
the
height
and
weight
standards
are
job-related.
secondly,
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
titles
vii
bona-fide-occupational-qualification
exception
is
an
extremely
narrow
exception
to
the
acts
general
prohibition
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
however,
we
conclude
that
the
explicit
gender
discrimination
and
the
official
regulation
is
within
the
statutory
exception.
alabama's
all
male
maximum
security
prisons
are
so
violent
and
disorganized
that
sexual
attacks
on
women
guards
are
likely
both
to
occur
and
to
exacerbate
the
problem
of
maintaining
institutional
security.
in
these
circumstances,
we
conclude
that
being
male
is
a
bona
--
is
a
bona-fide-occupational-qualification
for
the
job
of
guard
in
a
contact
position
in
alabama's
all
male
maximum
security
penitentiaries.
