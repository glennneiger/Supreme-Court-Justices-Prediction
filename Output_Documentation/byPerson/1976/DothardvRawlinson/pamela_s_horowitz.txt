ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
pamela
horowitz
counsel
for
appellee
dianne
rawlinson.
as
the
court
has
requested
i
will
initially
address
the
jurisdictional
point
raised
by
one
of
the
amicus
briefs.
the
appellee’s
position
is
simply
that
under
its
prior
holding
in
locomotive
engineers
versus
chicago,
rock
island
&
pacific
railroad,
this
court
clearly
has
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
under
1253
and
as
recently
as
1975
in
philbrook
v.
glodgett,
this
court
refused
to
reconsider
the
engineers
doctrine,
and
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
reason
for
that
doctrine
to
be
reconsidered
now.
turning,
if
i
may
then,
to
the
merits
of
the
title
vii
issues
in
this
case.
there
are
two
title
vii
questions:
the
first
involves
the
validity
of
height
and
weight
requirements
for
employment
as
a
prison
guard
in
the
alabama
system.
the
second
involves
the
validity
of
an
administrative
regulation
which
in
effect
provides
that
only
like
sex
guards
shall
work
in
the
state’s
prison.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
and
she
represents
the
class
your
honor
which
was
certified
as
all
women
who
are
employed
might
be
employed
or
are
applicants
for
employment
with
the
board
of
corrections.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
no,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
the
individual
plaintiff
in
this
case
did
not
meet
the
weight
requirements.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
but
i
would
submit
that
she
clearly
has
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
as
i
said
it
to
you
that
was
how
the
court
certified
as
all
women
who
are
employed,
might
be
employed,
or
are
applicants
for
employment
with
the
board
of
corrections
for
the
job
of
prison
guard.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
true.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
they
are
members
of
the
class
for
purposes
of
challenging
regulation
204
because
they
are
clearly
affected
by
the
administrative
regulation
which
excludes
women
from
working
in
the
male
facilities.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes,
i
would
say
that
they
are
a
class
of
women
that
are
clearly
included
in
the
class
as
it
was
certified
by
the
district
court
and
that
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now,
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
height
and
weight
requirement,
it
is
appellee’s
position
as
a
facially
neutral
job
qualification.
the
height
and
weight
requirement
is
governed
by
this
court’s
decision
in
griggs
versus
duke
power
company
and
the
rationale
of
that
case
was
correctly
applied
by
the
district
court
in
a
case
sub
judice.
the
allocation
of
the
burden
under
griggs
and
cases
where
you
are
dealing
with
a
facially
neutral
job
qualification
is
that
plaintiff
bears
the
initial
burden
of
proving
a
prima
facie
case
by
showing
that
the
job
qualification
in
issue
has
a
substantial
disparity
impact
on
women.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
subsection
1
your
honor
is
relied
on
for
purposes
of
the
height
and
weight
requirement
and
subsection
2
for
purposes
of
the
regulation
204.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes,
i
agree
they
are.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
but
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
in
the
rationale
of
griggs
that
would
limit
it
to
cases
brought
under
subsection
2.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
pardon
me.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
correct.
i
think
that
the
import
of
griggs
is
that
title
vii
looks
to
the
consequences
of
employment
practices
and
not
to
the
motivation
until
that
griggs
becomes
the
appropriate
analysis
whenever
you
have
a
showing
that
a
facially
neutral
job
qualification
has
a
disparity
impact
on
a
protected
class.
that
in
this
case
plaintiff
made
that
showing,
since
mr.
chiswick(ph)
indicates
that
when
combine
the
height
and
weight
requirements
disqualifies
41%
of
the
women
as
opposed
to
less
than
1%
of
the
men.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
your
honor,
the
court
below
relied
on
the
statistics
which
are
national
statistics
of
women
18
to
79,
they
are
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
true
your
honor
and
i
would
conceive
that
there
is
nothing
in
statistical
evidence
presented
to
the
court
below
to
show
the
actual
effect
on
applicants
of
the
height
and
weight
requirement.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
it
is
not
easily
available
and
that
it
should
not
be
required
as
part
of
the
plaintiff’s
evidentiary
burden
under
title
vii.
because
the
height
and
weight
requirement,
i
would
submit
is
itself
defining
qualification
and
it
discriminate,
its
evil
is
not
only
in
the
fact
that
it
discriminates
against
anybody
who
applies
and
is
rejected
for
being
under
the
minimums,
but
it
discriminates
against
all
those
who
know
of
the
minimums
and
do
not
apply
because
they
do
not
need
them.
it
is
unlike
a
test
or
an
interview
or
those
kinds
of
job
qualifications
where
a
potential
applicant
can
not
know,
whether
or
not,
he
or
she
would
be
disqualified
until
he
or
she
actually
undertakes
the
test
or
the
interview.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
because
the
regulation
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
but
the
regulation
which
says
that
women
can
not
be
hired
applies
to
the
all
male
penitentiaries
in
the
state.
they
were
hiring
only
since
1954
–74,
excuse
me.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
with
respect
to
the
four
male
penitentiaries
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
is
also
interesting
to
point
out
that
regulation
204
was
promulgated
while
this
lawsuit
was
pending.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
not
when
it
showing
to
have
a
disparity
impact
on
a
protected
class
under
title
vii,
unless
they
show
it
to
be
job
related.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
think
that
they
can
have
it
--
nothing
in
the
court’s
decision
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
think
nothing
in
the
court’s
decision
prohibits
them
from
having
proportional
hire…
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
would
say
they
can
and
they
do.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
but
when
the
burden
shifted
in
this
case
to
the
state
to
prove
that
the
height
and
weight
requirements
were
job
related,
i
would
submit
that
the
court,
that
the
state
not
only
failed
to
carry
its
burden
of
showing
that
any
height
and
weight
requirements
were
related
to
the
efficient
performance
of
the
duties
of
a
prison
guard,
but
they
certainly
failed
to
prove
that
these
particular
height
and
weight
requirements
had
any
relation
to
the
duties
of
a
prison
guy.
they
admitted
that
there
was
no
meaningful
study
conducted
prior
to
the
application
of
the
particular
requirement
of
5’2”
and
120.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
think
that
that
is
permissible
and
that
that
is
basically
what
the
district
court
said
because
the
district
court
said
that
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that
the
conclusion
that
you
reach
is
the
same
because
as
the
district
court
put
it,
even
assuming
that
height
and
weight
do
have
some
relationship
to
strength
and
that
strength
is
a
facet
of
effective
job
performance
as
a
prison
guard.
there
is
absolutely
no
proof
that
anybody
below
the
arbitrarily
defined
level
of
5’2”
and
120
pounds
is
unable
to
perform.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
do
not
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
court
has
permitted
that
in
title
vii
cases.
in
griggs
this
court
said,
that
you
are
going
after
arbitrary
and
unnecessary
barriers
to
discrimination.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
depending
on
the
proof
that
they
offer.
the
burden
is
on
the
state
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
it
would
depend
on
what
kind
of
proof
that
they
have
been
used.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
would
not
have
any
quarrel
under
this
case.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
they
have
drawn
an
arbitrary
line
which
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
i
am
not
conceding
to
you
that
that
would
be
permissible;
i
am
only
saying
that
it
would
not
necessarily
be
precluded
by
the
court’s
decision
to
strike
down
5’2”,
120.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
then
you
never
reach
to
the
question.
if
you
can
not
show
the
disparity
impact
--
that
that
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff,
and
if
there
is
no
disparity
impact
on
a
protected
class,
then
there
is
no
discrimination.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes,
your
honor
the
record,
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
the
federal
prison
system
uses
no
height
and
weight
requirement.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
among
state
systems
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
my
understanding
from
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
california
that
california
does
not.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
i
would
concede
to
this
court
that
the
use
height
and
weight
minimums
are
quite
common
among
law
enforcement
agencies,
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
permissible
ground
for
upholding
them
under
title
vii.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
are
a
number
of
--
the
vast
majority
of
law
enforcement
agencies
do
use
minimum
height
and
weight
requirements,
and
there
is
at
the
present
time
i
believe
a
lot
of
pending
litigation
dealing
with
the
validity
of
such
minimums.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
not
in
the
entire
system,
no
your
honor
but
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor
because
we
did
not
rely
on
the
failure
of
the
other
systems
to
not
use
height
and
weight
requirements
in
proving
our
case
to
the
court
below
and
i
do
not
think,
and
that
is
not
necessary
to
an
affirmance
of
that
court’s
holding.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
right
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
right
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
rawlinson.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
no,
her
claim
--
she
was
suing
the
department
public
safety
for
a
trooper
position,
she
comes
under
the
constitutional
claim.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct
this
is
title
vii,
which
brings
us
to
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
no,
when
mieth
wanted
to
be
a
state
trooper,
rawlinson
wanted
be
a
correctional
officer.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
right,
the
department
of
public
safety
shows
not
to
appeal.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
dianne
rawlinson.
so,
the
name
of
the
candidate
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct.
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
other
title
vii
claim
in
the
case
that
is
whether
regulation
204
comes
within
the
bfoq
defense.
it
is
appellee’s
position
that
sets
it
clear
that
all
of
the
indicia
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
bfoq
defense
point
to
the
fact
that
it
is
an
exception
which
is
to
be
narrowly
constructed.
i
would
propose
to
this
court,
that
the
standard
which
should
be
formulated
to
determine
the
applicability
of
the
defense
is
whether
the
classification
seeks
a
permissible
objective
and
whether
it
is
necessary
to
be
achievement
of
that
objective.
congress
used
the
word
‘necessary’
in
the
defining
a
bfoq,
i.e.
that
which
is
reasonably
necessary
to
the
effective
operation
of
a
business
or
enterprise,
and
i
think
that
this
standard
is
the
appropriate
one
for
allowing
the
employer
to
come
within
the
exceptions
when
the
evidence
warrants
it
but
making
sure
that
the
exception
is
not
allowed
to
swallow
the
rule.
now,
applying
that
standard
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
correct
in
refusing
to
apply
the
bfoq
defense.
the
first
justification
advanced
by
the
state
in
support
of
regulation
204
was
that
women
would
be
unable
to
safely
and
efficiently
perform
the
duties
of
a
prison
guard.
now,
that
is
clearly
a
permissible
objective.
in
other
words
it
is
--
plaintiff
does
not
argue
that
it
is
not
permissible
for
the
state
of
alabama
to
want
to
have
a
safe
and
efficient
workforce
in
its
prisons.
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
regulation
204
is
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
that
objective.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
is
correct.
i
would
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
do
not
think
is
that
is
proved
that
i
would
concede
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
that
i
think
what
--
it
is
in
the
opinion
as
the
state
alleged
that
20%
of
the
offenders
are
sex
offenders,
but
i
wouldn’t
quiver
over
it
because
i
do
not
think
--
i
would
concede
that
some
are
and
i
do
not
think
it
makes
a
difference
to
the
determination.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
do
not
think
the
record
shows
the
percentage
but
it
is
clear
that
a
number
of
them
are,
if
not,
the
majority.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
but
i
would
submit
that
the
burden
with
on
the
states
to
offer
factual
objective
data
that
women
could
not
perform
in
this
kind
of
prison
setting
and
that
that
proof
is
simply
not
in
this
record.
there
is
a
reliance
on
sexual
stereotypes
which
is
clearly
not
permissible
under
title
vii
and
in
effort
to
come
within
the
bfoq
defense.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
there
were
allegations
to
that
effect
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
i
think
that
is
also
clear
from
the
testimony
that
the
prison
administrators
who
testified
in
this
case
have
agreed
that
women
will
innately
incapable
--
i
mean
the
commissioner
of
corrections
testified
that
women
are
sex
objects.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
well,
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
that
was
only
a
part
of
the
argument.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes,
it
was
a
part,
but
i
do
not
think
it
was
what
the
state
intended
to
rely
on.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes,
i
would
not
analogize
that
you
--
customer
preference
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
think
that
--
well
that
was
not
my
intention
if
that
was
how
it
was
read.
the
way
i
would
handle
customer
preferences
under
the
formulation
i
have
suggested
to
the
court
to
deal
with
the
bfoq
defense
if
that
being
whether
the
classification
seeks
a
permissible
objective,
that
if
the
defense
with
customer
preferences
that
is
not
a
permissible
objective
under
title
vii,
and
you
do
not
go
beyond
that
point.
but
i
am
not
attempting
to
analogize
prisoners,
the
customers
by
any
means.
i
think
that
that
comes
in,
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
justification
advanced
by
the
state
dealing
with
the
privacy
needs
of
the
prisoners.
but
if
i
may
just
summarize
again
the
evidence
presented
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
women
can
safely
and
efficiently
perform
the
jobs,
it
is
appellee’s
contention
that
the
state
did
not
offer
any
factual
data
to
establish
that
women
in
fact
cannot
perform
that
they
relied
in
no
small
measure
on
sexual
stereotypes
that
the
evidence
established
and
the
district
court
found
that
women
were
working
satisfactorily
in
contact
positions
in
the
non-penitentiaries,
that
this
district
court
was
unusually
familiar
with
conditions
in
the
alabama
penitentiaries,
because
judge
johnson,
one
of
the
members
of
the
three-judge
court
had
just
handed
down
a
ruling
dealing
with
conditions
in
these
prisons.
and
that
this
three-judge
court
unanimously
found
that
the
evidence
just
was
not
there
that
women
could
not
perform
and
that
that
requires
an
affirmance.
even
though
the
burden
was
clearly
on
the
defendants
to
prove
women
could
not
perform,
it
is
also
to
be
noted
that
the
plaintiff
introduced
expert
testimony
from
prison
administrators
that
women
were
performing
in
this
capacity
elsewhere
and
in
a
satisfactory
manner.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
no,
your
honor,
the
record
reflects
in
his
testimony
is
a
maximum
security
prison
and
he
has
sex
offenders
and
those
who
have
committed
violent
crimes
as
well
as
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
believe
that
that
his
testimony
reflects,
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
the
height
and
weight
requirements?
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
no,
your
honor.
the
justification
attempted
there
was
the
relationship
that
the
height
and
weight
minimum
is
there
to
strength,
but
there
was
no
assertion
of
bfoq
is
an
affirmative
defense.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
no
and
the
position
of
the
appellee
that
the
district
court
preceded
correctly,
because
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
facially
neutral
job
qualification,
griggs
is
the
standard,
when
you
are
dealing
with
gender
based
discrimination,
such
as
we
find
in
regulation
204,
then
the
bfoq
defense
is
the
standard.
if
it
is
not
pleaded,
since
it
is
the
burden
on
the
defendants
that
ends
the
case.
if
i
may
quickly
also
address
the
second
justification
advanced,
by
the
state
in
support
of
regulation
204,
which
was
the
privacy
needs
of
prisoners,
again
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
proper
question
to
be
asked
is
whether
regulation
204
is
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
the
state
of
objective.
again,
i
would
concede
it
is
permissible
that
there
are
privacy
needs,
which
the
prison
administrators
rightly
should
concern
themselves
with.
our
position,
however,
is
that
the
state
failed
to
prove
that
regulation
204
was
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
this
objective,
because
the
evidence
is
clear
that
the
sexual
aspects
of
the
job,
which
are
basically
strip
searches,
can
be
separated
from
the
non-sexual
aspects,
and
the
state
attempted
to
offer
no
reason
at
all
why
it
could
not
achieve
its
objective,
as
the
district
court
suggested,
that
is
by
selective
work
responsibilities
as
opposed
to
the
total
exclusion
of
women.
indeed
we
are
dealing
primarily
with
the
four
male
penitentiaries
and
the
evidence
reflected
that
in
two
of
these
facilities
no
systematic
strip
searches
are
conducted,
and
in
the
other
two,
less
than
25%
of
the
workforce
is
involved
in
systematic
care.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
there
is
one
women’s
prison
your
honor
which
you
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
there
are
not
any
male
guards
in
contact
positions,
there
are
males
in
non-contact
positions,
but
since
there
is
only
one
prison
it
employed
6%
of
the
workforce,
and
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
four
male
penitentiaries,
you
are
talking
about
77%
of
workforce.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
it
is
not
here
and
i
would
submit
that,
the
height
–-
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
--
that
facially
neutral
job
qualification
are
not
be
judged
by
the
bfoq
exception
that
the
defense
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
and
it
was
not
pleaded.
no,
it
was
not
asserted…
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
by
the
griggs
test,
job
relatedness.
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
since
we
are
talking
about
the
bfoq
defense
that
the
burden
was
on
the
state
to
show
that
there
were
other
sexual
aspects
of
the
job
that
could
not
be
separated,
and
in
the
non-penitentiaries
--
ms.
pamela
s.
horowitz
i
do
not
think
it
is
your
honor
when
the
facts
include
the
evidence
that
in
the
non-penitentiaries
alabama
is
employing
women
in
contact
positions
and
the
only
restriction
that
they
have
placed
on
the
women
is
that
they
do
not
conduct
strip
searches.
they
are
patrolling,
they
are
conducting
bathroom
inspections,
and
i
do
not
see
how
the
state
can
admits
on
the
one
hand
to
evidence
showing
that
women
do
that
work
in
non-penitentiaries,
and
then
come
back
and
somehow
say,
well,
they
can
not
do
it
in
penitentiaries.
so,
that
would
be
my
reason
for
saying
that
the
only
thing
this
court
need
to
concern
itself
with,
with
respect
to
the
privacy
issue,
is
the
systematic
strip
searches,
and
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
indicates
they
can
be
handled
as
the
district
court
ruled
they
should
be,
and
this
is
the
proper
standard
under
the
bfoq
defense.
thank
you.
