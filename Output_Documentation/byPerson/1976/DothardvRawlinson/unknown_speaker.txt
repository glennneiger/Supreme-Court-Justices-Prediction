unknown
speaker
now,
we
do
not
have
to
state
duplicacy.
unknown
speaker
only
the
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
do
these
statistics
that
you
are
taking
into
account,
the
eligible
females
and
eligible
males,
are
they
restricted
to
eligibles
in
the
sense
of
being
in
the
labor
market
or
just
to
women
in
general
and
men
in
general?
unknown
speaker
with
this
respect
to
what
kind
of
job
here?
what
job
is
at
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
nothing
with
the
highway
patrol.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
issue
there,
height
and
weight
or
--
unknown
speaker
are
they
both
here?
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
gather
that
plaintiff
here
could
not
have
brought
a
statutory
action
because
she
had
never
exhausted
first
before
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
so,
then
it
had
to
be
just
a
constitutional
case.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
not
all
of
it.
unknown
speaker
with
the
decision
with
respect
to
the
statute
was
purely
based
upon
title
vii,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
decision
with
respect
to
the
prison
guards
sexual
regulation
with
the
regulation
was
based
on
both.
unknown
speaker
in
the
afl
amicus
brief
is
that
a
fortiori
if
that
was
the
title
vii
case.
unknown
speaker
in
the
light
of
washington
against
davis
and
other
cases,
if
it
did
not
violate
title
vii
it
could
not
possibly
violate
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
and
that
makes
unnecessary.
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
think
anybody
including
any
amicuses
saying
that
the
invention
of
the
three-judge
court
was
inappropriate.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
does
not
go
to
the
question
really
of
jurisdiction
here.
unknown
speaker
well
the
point
is
if
the
plaintiff
prevails
upon
the
statutory
claim,
the
constitutional
claim
is
never
reached
and
the
three-judge
court
is
never
convened
under
the
preferable
procedure.
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
well
the
plaintiff
isn’t
assured
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
if
even
on
the
constitutional
claim
the
injunction
is
denied
on
some
basis
other
than
the
merits
of
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
so,
there
is
not
appeal
then
that
is
under
--
unknown
speaker
well,
was
that
constitution
challenge
to
title
vii?
i
guess
this
is
national
(inaudible).
was
that
made
below?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
see
how
that
handles
your
argument
that
there
is
still
appealability
here.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
is
an
issue
that
was
never
attended,
never
decided
below.
unknown
speaker
you
have
not
argued
philbrook
and
glodgett.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
isn’t
that
footnote
is
the
strongest
precedent
that
you
have?
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
you
at
least
have
that
counterclaim
in
the
district
court
in
order
to
raise
that
sort
of
a
constitutional
question
when
the
plaintiff
is
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
your
own
statute?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
spell
that
out?
you
say
you
raised
that
as
a
matter
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
no,
not
as
declaring
unconstitutional
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
sentence
you
to
say
as
a
defendant
in
the
district
court
and
you
never
did.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
subject-matter
jurisdiction,
i
do
not
get
your
jump
from
the
unconstitutional,
as
the
claim
of
unconstitutionality
of
title
vii
to
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
the
merits,
that
is
the
merits,
that
is
not
a
matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
they
still
have
alleged
the
claim
under
1331
and
1343
that
your
statute
and
regulations
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
based
on
what,
the
supremacy
clause?
unknown
speaker
if
i
may
say
so,
i
--
perhaps
i
am
touse
on
this,
but
it
seems
to
me
is
that
that
is
a
matter
of
defense,
for
you
to
assert
in
the
district
court,
the
claim
was
that
your
practice
has
violated
title
vii.
put
to
one
side
for
a
moment
the
claim
that
they
are
unconstitutional,
but
that
your
statute
and
regulations
violated
title
vii.
and
if
you
say
in
defense
of
that,
title
vii
is
unconstitutional,
that
is
for
you
to
say
in
defense
on
the
merits,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
--
and
then
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
decide
it,
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
to
this
title
vii
claim,
you
are
asking
the
district
court
to
hold
the
title
vii
as
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
you.
that
is
something
for
you
to
assert
in
defense
on
the
merits
of
the
claim
against
you.
there
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
court,
for
example,
without
jurisdiction
to
hold
something
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
got
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
all
statutes
of
congress
are
presumed
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
have
not
challenged
them
at
all
in
district
court,
i
would
not
spend
a
lot
of
time
arguing
a
point
like
that
up
here,
if
i
would.
unknown
speaker
mr.
evans
you
have
fifteen
minutes
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case
now.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
definition
of
the
contact
position?
unknown
speaker
the
whole
issue
on
the
merits
of
the
title
vii
issue,
whether
or
not
this
is
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
reasonably
necessary
to
the
normal
operation
of
the
particular
business
or
the
enterprises?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
entire
issue
on
the
merits
of
the…
unknown
speaker
and
of
the
title
vii
claim.
unknown
speaker
except
that
there
is
height
and
weight
thing
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
no,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
unknown
speaker
to
whom
does
the
regulation
apply?
unknown
speaker
or
it
applies
to
people
anybody
who
want
to
be
selected
off
of
the
register
has
to
satisfy.
unknown
speaker
well,
aren’t
these
assignments
made
from
the
training
register.
unknown
speaker
and
then
to
certify
them
they
come
up
to
trainee
register.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
do
you
get
on
the
trainee
register?
unknown
speaker
the
regulation
deals
very
frankly
with
sex,
with
gender,
if
you
will
unlike
the
height
and
weight
requirement
which
is
a
frankly
the
gender
based
distinctions.
unknown
speaker
distinguishes
between
females
and
males
as
such.
unknown
speaker
but
were
any
these
plaintiffs
in
this
case
on
the
register?
unknown
speaker
well
they
have
to
get
on
the
register
before
there
even
eligible
to
be
selected
for
counselor.
unknown
speaker
and
to
get
on
the
register
they
have
to
satisfy
height
and
weight
limitations.
unknown
speaker
which
are
not
sexually
oriented.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
everreach
the
title
vii
case
then
without
until
you
decide
whether
the
height/weight
issue
is
--
you
have
to
decide
that
first,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
the
argument
made
that
the
heights
weights
implicitly,
inherently
involve
a
sex
discrimination
because
the
generality
of
men
are
bigger
than
the
generality
of
women?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
were
to
uphold
the
height
and
weight
requirements,
wouldn’t
that
be
the
end
of
the
case
as
to
these
particular
plaintiffs,
because
if
they
could
not
have
met
the
height
and
weight
requirements
they
could
never
have
gotten
on
the
trainee
register
and
therefore
they
never
would
have
had
the
confront
the
sexually
described
classification.
unknown
speaker
at
place
it
would
be
holding
that
the
height/weight
requirements
are
appropriate
standards
for
prison
guards
--
unknown
speaker
--
without
respect
to
sex
(inaduible)
what
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested.
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
do
you
represent
a
single
individual
plaintiff,
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
who
are
under
certain
height
and
under
certain
weight?
is
at
the
end
of
class?
unknown
speaker
it
would
have
to
be,
wouldn’t
it?
otherwise
it
has
no
claim.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
the
class
you
represent
therefore,
i
would
suppose,
would
not
meet
either
the
weight
or
the
height
requirements,
one
or
the
other
or
else
they
would
be
a
class
without
a
grievance.
unknown
speaker
but
what
was
the
class
that
was
certified?
unknown
speaker
well,
many
such
women
would
not
be
affected
by
the
height
and
weight
statute.
unknown
speaker
then
how
could
they
be
members
of
the
class.
unknown
speaker
they
never
get
on
the
roll.
if,
as
my
brothers
have
pointed
out,
the
height
and
weight
requirement
is
valid
then
your
named
plaintiff
never
gets
on
the
role
and
is
never
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
regulation.
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
your
finding
about
the
women
is
that
women
who
are
six
feet
tall
and
150
pounds
cannot
qualify
for
the
inside
so-called
contract
positions.
that
is
really
a
subclass
isn’t,
it
of
your
general
class?
unknown
speaker
all
females
would
have
a
--
all
women
would
be
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
regulation.
unknown
speaker
ms.
horowitz,
before
you
go
on,
which
subsection
of
2000e-2
(a)
were
you
claiming
under
in
your
title
vii
claim?
section
1
about
fail
--
or
if
you
will
turn
to
61
of
the
appellant’s
brief,
that
you
are
probably
so
familiar
with
them,
you
do
not
have
to,
but
the
subsection
1
talks
about
failing
or
refusing
to
hire
and
subsection
2
talks
about
limiting
segregating
or
classifying.
unknown
speaker
they
are
cast
in
somewhat
different
language,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
subsection
2
more
resembles
the
language
with
the
section
that
was
involved
in
griggs
than
subsection
1.
unknown
speaker
you
prefer
to
the
rationale
over
holding.
unknown
speaker
i
say
you
are
referring
to
the
rationale
rather
than
the
holding.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
are
the
kinds
of
the
women,
the
women
who
were
looking
for
jobs
or
just
women
in
alabama
as
a
class?
unknown
speaker
all
women
between
18
and
79
are
not
in
the
job
market,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
why
was
not
that
evidence
presented,
it
is
certainly
available
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
ms.
horowitz,
what
worries
me
about
this
case
if
the
alabama
won’t
discriminate
against
women.
they
did
it,
they
said,
“no
woman
could
be
hired,”
so
what
could
is
the
weight
and
height
there?
unknown
speaker
why
would
they
waste
that?
they
have
already
said
they
can
not
have
a
woman.
unknown
speaker
that
is
worthy
when
it
combined
the
two.
i
mean
when
they
knew
--
as
i
understand
the
statute,
when
alabama
wanted
to
say,
we
would
not
hire
a
woman,
they
said,
“we
would
not
hire
woman.”
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean
they
knew
how
to
say
it,
they
knew
how
to
say
it.
unknown
speaker
don’t
you
think,
they
can
put
in
a
weight
and
a
height
restriction
of
some
sort?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
they
say
that
they
will
not
hire
anybody
weighting
more
than
400
pounds.
unknown
speaker
would
not
that
be
fine
--
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
but
they
also
say,
“we
will
not
hire
anybody
over
the
age
of
55.
with
approval
this
court
said
that
kind
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
this
court
said
so.
unknown
speaker
ms.
horowitz
,
can
you
give
me
name
of
any
police
force
or
prison
guard
system
in
the
country
that
does
not
have
a
weight
and
height
requirement?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
said
state,
i
thought
i
said
state.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
thinking
that,
i
was
just
wondering
how
many
police
systems
we
would
upset
if
we
go
along
with
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
just
want
to
know
--
unknown
speaker
ms.
horowitz,
i
am
correct,
am
i
not
that
both
the
height
and
weight
requirement.
that
was
struck
down
under
title
vii,
wasn’t
that?
unknown
speaker
then
the
other
issue
is
also
a
title
vii
issue
namely
bona
fide
occupational
qualification,
isn’t
that
so?
unknown
speaker
so,
the
only
issue
is
we
have
both
under
title
vii--
unknown
speaker
no
constitutional
issue
at
all.
unknown
speaker
who
was
that
wanted
to
be
the
prison
guard?
what
name
is?
unknown
speaker
rawlinson?
unknown
speaker
she
was
the
one
who
was
excluded
basically
because
of
height
and
weight
in
contract
and
she
is
the
one
who
was
perfect
at
the
procedural
steps.
unknown
speaker
mrs.
mieth
had
perfect
--
unknown
speaker
now,
her
claim
is
not
here.
unknown
speaker
but
she
also
applied,
and
may
be
this
where
i
am
confused,
she
wanted
to
be
either
a
state
trooper
or
a
correctional
officer,
was
that
is?
unknown
speaker
now,
this
has
to
be
addressed
in
the
context
of
this
type
of
penitentiary,
all
male
housing
only
multiple
offenders.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
20%
of
whom
are
there
for
sex
related
offenses.
unknown
speaker
well
i
thought
that
is
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
are,
if
this
record
shows
it,
in
these
institutions
were
crimes
of
violence?
unknown
speaker
that
is
true
with
most
state
prisons
in
our
country,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
wasn’t
the
reliance
rather
on
the
prisoner’s
sexual
stereotypes?
unknown
speaker
well
wasn’t
that
the
reliance
on
the
bfoq
defense
that
the
prisoners
would
have
this
image
about
female
custodians?
unknown
speaker
that
in
the
view
of
incarcerated
that
all
male
prisoners
where
all
of
them
guilty
of
multiple
offenses,
that
wasn’t
the
bfoq
defense
premised
upon
the
attitude
of
those
prisoners
toward
women
guards.
unknown
speaker
well,
was
it
a
part
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
rather
thought
it
did
in
its
argument,
and
then
of
course,
you
would
counter
with
the
cases
that
say
that
customer
stereotypes
could
not
relied
upon
this
steward(ph)
cases
and
so
on,
then
i
was
going
to
ask
you
if
this
isn’t
a
little
different
from
customer
as
this
is
a
nature
of
a
incarcerated
human
being.
unknown
speaker
you
did
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
we
have
the
amicus
brief
in
california
here
too.
unknown
speaker
was
there
bfoq
defense
asserted
to
the
statutory,
to
the
attack
on
the
statute
as
contrasted
with
the
regulation?
unknown
speaker
the
height
and
weight
requirements.
unknown
speaker
there
was
not?
unknown
speaker
are
there
women’s
prisons
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
are
those
all
female
guards?
unknown
speaker
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
suggest
that
the
height/weight
restriction
is
not
justifiable
by
as
a
bona
fide
work
qualification?
or
is
that
issue
here,
is
it
open
that
is
--
unknown
speaker
it
isn’t
even
open.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
defense
was
not
asserted
as
--
unknown
speaker
now,
what
are
they
to
be
justified
by?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
emphasized
the
searching
problem
that
is
only
one
element,
there
is
the
problem
of
patrolling
a
dormitory
type
of
institution
where
there
are
open
doors
and
people
moving
around
constantly.
that
is
a
far
more
important
factor
than
the
search
problem
that
you
emphasize.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
judicially
noticeable
when
you
heard
there
is
a
recitation
of
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
how
long
is
the
statute
been
in
the
books?
unknown
speaker
1971.
so,
for
at
least
six
years
until
now,
anybody
under
5’3”
in
height
and
120
pounds
in
weight
would
--
that
there
is
no
point
in
applying,
don’t
you
think?
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
i
assume
that
in
alabama
the
guards
inside
do
not
have
weapons.
unknown
speaker
the
only
thing
they
have
is
their
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
that
is
all?
