justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
administrative
finding
has
been
sustained
on
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
suppose
that
it
has
been
tried
out
before
the
administrative
agency
and
it
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
record,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it’s
sustained.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
would
say
that
the
government
wants
to
sue
you
for
occurrence
and
it’s
de
novo
in
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right,
but
you
don’t
have
a
right
to
jury
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn’t
think
you
would
have
any
right
to
enjoin
the
administrative
proceeding
pending
some
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what’s
your
position;
what’s
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
statute
sound
like
this
when
you
would
think
the
administrative
proceeding
should
abate
until
the
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn’t
say,
in
this
case,
you
would
have
any
right
to
enjoin
an
administrative
proceeding
until
there
is
a
jury
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suggest
there
is
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
connection
with
involuntary
proceeding
in
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
how
about
just
the
matter
of
declaring
a
person
bankrupt?
justice
byron
r.
white
[laughter]
i
said
involuntarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
no
i
am
talking
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
when
you
all
of
a
sudden
find
that
the
creditors
have
filed
the
petition,
have
you
declared
the
bankrupt,
and
you
say
i
demand
a
jury
trial
because
this
will
--
the
net
effect
of
this
would
be
to
transfer
all
my
property
to
the
trusty
immediately
upon
--
and
so
i
demand
the
jury
trial.
do
you
think
we
have
a
jury
trial
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
didn’t
sound
like
the
argument
you
were
thinking,
your
colleague
was
making
this
morning.
justice
byron
r.
white
what’s
your
understanding
of
the
law
in
a
criminal
case
where
the
only
authorized
penalty
is
a
fine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
unconstitutional,
what’s
the
constitutional
rule?
suppose
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that
the
only
penalty
for
this
crime
is
a
fine
and
you
can
fined
up
to
a
million
dollar.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
atlas
roofing
and
frank
irey
cases,
two
courts
of
appeals
decided
that
the
federal
occupational
safety
and
health
act
could
be
enforced
by
the
administrative
in
position
of
civil
crimes
subject
to
judicial
review,
but
at
no
stage
subject
to
the
intervention
of
a
jury.
we
affirm
that
those
judgments,
we
owe
to
that
to
the
seventh
amendment
which
generally
provides
for
jury
trials
and
civil
cases
are
not
applicable
to
statutory
enforcement
proceedings.
mr.
justice
blackmun
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
these
cases.
