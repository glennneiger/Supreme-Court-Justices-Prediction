mr.
mcneill
stokes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
these
cases
involves
whether
our
constitution
allows
the
federal
governments
to
issue
fines
against
its
citizens
without
the
right
to
jury
trial
of
their
peers.
we
submit
that
the
clear
command
of
the
seventh
amendment
of
united
states
constitution
expressly
forbids
it.
more
fundamentally
at
issue
is
also
the
very
bedrock
of
judicial
power
under
article
3
of
the
constitution.
these
cases
take
on
particular
importance
because
they
are
the
first
cases
to
come
before
this
court
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
of
1970
and
its
enforcement
structure
which
is
unique.
the
most
obvious
consequence
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act’s
enforcement
structure
is
the
united
states
government
seeks
fines
against
its
citizens
administratively
without
the
right
to
jury
trial
during
any
stage
in
the
proceedings.
under
this
most
unusual
enforcement
structure
of
penalties,
the
inspector
issues
citations
and
fines
turns
civil
penalties.
a
citizen’s
recourse
is
to
another
administrative
agency,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
review
commission,
which
is
still
part
of
the
executive
branch
of
government.
unlike
other
penalty
statutes,
there
is
only
limited
judicial
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
all
effect
which
are
determined
administratively
are
conclusive
if
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
we
submit
that
this
executive
agency,
the
delegation
of
power
to
this
agency,
violates
the
constitution
in
its
relationships
first
to
its
citizens
and
that
is
providing
a
right
to
jury
trial;
and
second
in
its
relationships
to
judicial
branch.
a
ruling
the
petition’s
favor
will
do
no
more
than
uphold
the
constitution
as
we
have
traditionally
and
historically
known
it.
we
submit
that
a
ruling
in
the
government’s
favor
will
effect
the
most
profound
redistribution
of
power
among
the
three
branches
of
government.
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
expand
on
constitutional
rights;
we
are
merely
asking
the
court
to
recognize
the
traditional
and
historical
right
recognized
by
our
forefathers
in
the
seventh
amendment
that
a
citizen
has
a
right
to
jury
trial
when
the
federal
government
seeks
a
fine
against
him
in
whatever
manner
and
whatever
form
it
takes.
we
ask
no
more
than
that
and
we
submit
that
constitution
will
tolerate
nothing
less.
now
under
osha,
the
executive
branch
of
government
has
been
vested
with
plenary
powers
to
determine
and
assess
fines
administratively
without
the
right
to
jury
trial
and
in
violation
of
the
seventh
amendment,
which
provides
that
a
citizen
has
a
right
to
jury
trial
and
suits
at
common
law
where
the
amount
of
controversy
exceeds
$20.
this
particular
provision
is
extremely
clear
and
the
history
is
extremely
clear
that
a
suit
at
common
law
totally
and
unequivocally
embraces
a
fine
sought
by
the
united
states
government.
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
seventh
amendment,
both
in
england
and
united
states,
a
citizen
would
have
been
afforded
a
right
to
jury
trial
when
the
government
sought
a
fine
against
him.
in
england
and
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
seventh
amendment
and
for
years
before,
a
fine
would
have
been
brought
on
the
judicial
side
of
court
of
exchequer
and
there
they
would
have
gotten
the
right
to
jury
trial
under
the
common
law
side.
as
we
have
briefed
in
our
brief,
all
the
states,
virtually
all
of
the
states
would
have
granted
jury
trial
for
fines
and
forfeitures
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
seventh
amendment.
the
history
of
this
act
or
the
history
of
this
amendment,
in
england,
was
preserved
in
america
under
the
seventh
amendment
in
1791.
only
in
america
did
england
ever
attempt
to
the
non-
citizens
jury
trial
and
that
was
under
the
america’s
trade
act
in
the
courts
of
vice-admiralty,
which
historians
tell
us
is
one
of
the
sparks
that
ignited
the
revolution
and
directly
led
to
that
provision
to
deliver
--
that
provision
in
the
declaration
of
independence
that
said
the
kind
george
has
denied
us
jury
trial
in
many
cases.
well,
when
hancock’s
ship,
the
sloop,
liberty
was
seized
in
boston
harbor
in
1767
along
with
its
cargo,
england
also
brought
a
case
against
him
for
an
in
personam
fine
of
triple
the
amount
of
the
goods.
well,
he
hired
a
young
lawyer
defending
him
in
those
days,
boston
lawyer,
john
adams,
and
adam’s
argument
is
just
as
valid
before
this
court
today
as
it
was
200
years
ago
when
he
said
the
legislative
authority
by
which
this
act
is
passed
is
grievous
enough,
but
the
way
it
is
enforced
with
these
executive
tribunals
makes
it
more
penal
than
any
of
the
statutes
around.
he
says
“my
client
is
not”
--
and
i
am
paraphrasing
a
little
bit,
he
says,
“my
client
is
not
tried
by
the
law
of
the
land
by
jury
trial
but
by
a
single
judge.”
and
he
says,
“no
matter
how
fair
that
judge
is,
it
makes
this
act
extremely
penal
and
my
client
has
lost
a
precious
right,
the
right
to
jury
trial.”
well,
in
1791,
this
right
was
embedded
in
the
constitution
for
all
americans
to
come
as
it
was
passed
and
codified
in
the
seventh
amendment.
in
response
to
a
call
in
one
of
the
foremost
price
against
the
constitution
was
originally
drafted
was
the
a
preservation
of
the
right
to
jury
trial.
it
is
now
in
great
jeopardy,
because
now
200
years
later,
the
federal
government
is
seeking
fines
against
its
citizens
and
exactly
tribunals
with
much
similar
procedures
as
those
courts
of
vice-admiralty.
but
more
fundamentally
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
the
very
bedrock
of
judicial
power.
the
third
circuit’s
opinion,
the
third
circuit
opinion
in
the
case
of
frank
irey
basically
held
that
the
united
states
government
can
vest,
congress
can
vest,
an
administrative
tribunal
with
enforcement
powers,
in
this
case
penalties,
and
thereby
eliminate
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial.
implicit
in
this
holding
is
that
congress
and
not
the
court
have
the
power
to
determine
when
and
if
a
provision
of
constitution
applies
merely
by
vesting
it
in
an
administrative
agency.
judge
gibbons
and
the
other
three
dissenters
in
that
case,
as
they
saw,
stoutly
pointed
out
that
if
congress
can
determine
by
legislative
fiat
when
and
if
a
provision
of
the
constitution
applies
and
thereby
define
the
meaning
of
the
words,
suits
at
common
law,
what
role
do
the
article
iii
courts
play.
he
also
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
an
absurd
speculum
if
the
only
branch
of
government,
bound
by
the
bill
of
rights,
would
be
the
article
iii
courts.
and
in
commenting
on
the
majority’s
holding
of
their
interpretation
of
jones
&
laughlin
versus
the
national
labor
relations
board,
he
pointed
out
that
if
that
case
is
interpreted
for
the
breadths
that
the
majority
gave
it,
then
undenounced
to
world
of
legal
scholarship,
that
case
affected
the
most
profound
and
enormous
redistribution
of
power
of
any
case
in
the
history
of
the
united
states.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
mr.
justice,
our
interpretation
of
jones
&
laughlin
merely
stands
for
this
doctrine
that
congress
can
vest
an
administrative
agency
with
traditional
acquirer
roles
that
is
the
seize
and
desist
power,
which
is
an
equitable
injunction
remedy
and
an
incidental
back
pay
remedy
which
is
a
classic
restitutionary
remedy.
but
beyond
that
they
cannot
vest
an
administrative
agency
with
powers
that
are
judicial
suits
at
common
law.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
if
the
back
pay
is
a
restitutionary
type
of
remedy,
i
would
say
that
would
be
permissible
in
that
case.
if
it
arose
in
a
situation
where
the
nlrb
add
a
seize
and
desist
power
coupled
with
back
pay.
but
in
osha,
you
are
dealing
with
a
naked
vengeance
penalty
where
the
government
is
putting
a
penalty
on
its
citizens
for
past
violation.
it
is
the
void
of
any
acquittal
consideration,
the
void
of
any
restitutionary
element
and
the
void
of
any
compensatory
element.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
we,
in
this
case,
we
are
not
trying
to
invalidate
any
abatement
powers
of
the
court.
we
are
merely
saying,
in
the
posture
of
these
cases,
they
arrives
in
a
posture
wherein
these
case,
they
are
monetary
penalties,
$5000
sought
against
irey
and
$600
sought
against
atlas
roofing
company.
we
submit
it
is
that
violation
that
offends
the
constitution,
the
collection
of
monetary
penalties,
which
are
not
at
all
incidental.
of
course,
they
could
not
be
acquittal
remedies
under
the
classic
doctrines
that
equity
will
not
enforce
a
penalty
and
will
not
enforce
criminal
sanctions,
particularly
the
penalty
provisions.
we
submit,
as
we’ve
briefed,
that
there
are
no
sense
ancillary
and
that,
in
this
case,
they
are
primary,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that’s
all
that’s
being
sought
in
these
cases.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir,
we
do
recognize
that
and
as
did
as
i
cited
professor
davis,
in
his
plea,
he
said,
they
can
involve
regulatory
orders
involving
millions
of
dollars,
but
they
cannot
asses
$20
in
a
penalty,
in
professor
davis’
plea
that
we
have
cited
to.
there
is
great
distinction,
because
if
these
cases
arise
on
$5,000,
but
the
same
principle
applies,
no
matter
how
it
is
if
it’s
in
excess
of
$20,
we
submit
to
the
court.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
it’s,
yes
sir.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
mr.
justice,
at
any
stage
either
under
the
normal
regulatory
penal
powers,
they
either
have
to
bring
the
penalties
originally
in
court
or
they
have
de
novo
review.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
in
this
case,
neither
is
provided,
as
a
matter
it’s
expressly
stated
that
it
will
not
be
provided,
but
--
and
it
even
has
conclusions
that
the
facts
of
the
commission
are
supported
on
substantial
evidence.
in
this
case,
it
is
not
provided
at
any
stage
and
this
is
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that’s
profound
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
before
a
court,
an
article
iii
court.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
and
a
jury
or
a
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
a
jury
--
it
doesn’t
stipulate,
of
course,
as
to
whether
the
local
preserver
would
be
an
article
iii
court,
we
would
submit
it.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
a
jury.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
there
is
a
limited
court
of
appeals
review
where
they
have
a
substantial
evidence
test.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
universal
camera,
but
in
universal
camera
there
was
no
fines
being
sought.
no,
of
course,
that
was
a
national
labor
relations
board
case.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
raw
penalty,
as
arises
in
this
particular
case,
$5,000
and
the
other
one,
$600.
in
support
of
its
position
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
there
is
a
similar
--
yes
sir
and
that
would
be
in
a
separate
proceeding.
there
is
a
similar
proceeding
to
that
under
this
act.
it
has
a
most
unusual
thing
in
which
a
decision
to
contest
can
in
fact
subject
you
to
cumulative
penalties
on
top
of
that
if
the
inspector
comes
back
and
says,
“i
don’t
think
you
contested
in
good
faith”,
or
if
he
says,
“you
didn’t
abate”,
then
it
can
attach
up
to
$1,000.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
well,
that
would
be
a
separate
proceedings.
you
see
that
is
backing
up
the
equitable
remedy.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
right,
yes
sir,
mr.
justice.
after
the
--
mr.
justice
stevens
that
would
be
very
similar
to
the
federal
trade
commission
enforcement
power,
where
they
have
to
go
to
court
for
the
failure
to
abate
or
the
failure
to
comply
with
its
orders.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
again,
they
are
seeking
a
monetary
penalty.
now
you
may
say
that
the
--
you
get
a
back
pay
award,
which
is
an
incidental
restitutionary
award,
and
that
the
penalty
is
still
money
but
it
is
compensatory
or
restoring
the
status
quo.
it
was
never
a
suit
at
common
law.
but
when
you
get
to
a
penalty
it
was
always
a
suit
at
common
law,
a
classic
suit
at
common
low,
which
we
have
submitted
in
our
briefs
and
we
noted
that
the
government
did
not
contest.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that
could
--
yes
sir;
that
could
be
that
it
is
not
and
that
depending
on
the
penalty,
it
would
be
in
a
nature
of
a
contempt
type
of
case.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
on
the
contempt
issue,
but
it’s
my
understanding
that
procedure
is
correct
that
you
do
not
have
a
jury
trial,
but
if
you
do
not
comply
with
the
order
of
the
commission,
you
then
face,
i
believe
it
is
up
to
a
$5,000
a
day
penalty,
which
is
brought
directly
in
court.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
in
the
district
court,
in
the
ftc
regulations;
it’s
my
understanding.
now
the
government,
in
particular
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
it
is
the
$5,000
fine
which
we
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
in
this
case,
there
was
no
contention
that
there
was
not
abatement
once
the
ditch
was
closed
up
immediately
and
it
was
never
an
issue
in
the
case,
in
the
frank
irey
case.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that
would
be
our
interpretation
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
support
of
his
position
the
government
cites
the
tax
and
immigration
cases,
where
the
doctrine
that
they
can
bypass
the
seventh
amendment.
but
in
these
tax
and
immigration
cases,
there
are
unique
areas
where
the
plenary
power,
congress
has
been
recognized
as
complete
and
exclusive.
this
power
has
traditionally
been
limited,
even
in
those
cases,
to
only
these
unique
areas.
now
the
government
urges
that
these
cases
be
expanded.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
under
the
--
traditionally
the
government
has
always
had,
the
legislative
part
of
government
executive
part
of
government,
albeit
all
governments,
have
had
the
power
to
control
its
boards
free
from
the
interference
of
courts.
also
in
taxation
cases,
they
have
always
had
this
power.
in
england,
at
the
time
of
passage
of
the
seventh
amendment,
a
revenue
case
would
have
been
brought
on
the
revenue
side
of
court
of
exchequer,
but
a
fine
and
penalty
case
would
have
been
brought
on
the
judicial
side
of
the
exchequer.
but
only,
in
these
cases
particularly,
the
courts,
as
they
have
stated
in
these
particular
unique
areas,
have
been
careful
to
say,
this
is
only
confined
to
these
unique
areas
similar
with
the
legislative
line
or
court
line
of
cases,
where
congress
has
plenary
powers
to
deal
with
the
district
of
columbia
and
other
territories
in
which
that
power
has
been
upheld,
because
the
congress
is
then
acting
as
a
state
with
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
state
and
federal.
but
the
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
there
would
be
de
novo
review
on
the
facts,
which
is
very
similar
to
the
other
statutes
with
which
we
are
familiar
with.
what
comes
to
mind
is
the
de
novo
review.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
not
on
the
penalty
cases.
it
would
be
very
similar
to
other
de
novo
review
as
(inaudible)
the
coal
mine
safety
act
as
we
interpret
coal
mine
safety
act
to
be.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
it
goes
on
the
record,
sir.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
it’s
sustained.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
if
you
do
not
give
de
novo
review
on
the
facts
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that’s
right,
you
have
no
right
to
jury
trial
and
there
is
nothing
left.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that
would
be
opposition,
of
course,
fines
could
be
determined
judicially
since
fines
are
traditionally
determined
judicially.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
it
would
be
the
fact
of
the
violation.
the
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yeah,
the
fact
of
violation.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
and
mr.
justice
stewart
these
are
within
the
traditional
realm
of
juries,
the
typical
facts.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
of
course,
in
this
congress
should
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
well,
in
our
original
brief
and
in
our
original
petition
for
certiorari,
which
was
not
granted
on
this
issue,
we
took
the
position
that
a
civil
penalty
is
noting
more
than
a
penal
fine,
and
certainly
to
a
corporation.
there
is
no
difference
any
$10,000
fine
to
a
corporation,
criminal
fine
than
a
$10,000
dollar
civil
penalty.
we
are
dealing
semantics,
but
the
effect
is
the
same.
we
would
--
i
would
say
this
is
fairly
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
we
would
say
that
that
would
be
up
to
congress
to
determine,
congress,
within
its
power,
could
say,
that
would
be
up
to
the
judge,
but
as
to
the
facts
the
seventh
amendment,
we
say,
is
quite
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that’s
right.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that
is
our
entire
position.
and
if
not
you
are
left
with
a
device
that
circumvents
the
seventh
amendment
in
a
nice
neat
little
package
that
says,
well,
initially
we
go
to
this
administrative
agency
and
then
we
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
somehow
the
right
to
jury
trial
just
evanescence.
and
if
it’s
going
to
be
done
in
this
statute,
then
i
submit,
and
we
have
briefed
in
our
papers
the
administrative
conference
of
united
states
in
its
recommendation
to
all
other
agencies
that
all
other
agencies
get
this
power.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that
is
precisely
our
point
mr
justice
marshall.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that
presupposes
that
the
jury
finds
us
guilty
and
we
have
a
right
to
a
jury
of
our
peers
and
the
interposing
of
a
jury
between
the
judiciary
albeit
in
this
case;
it’s
not
judges
would
like
tenure;
it’s
administrators.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
that
would
be
our
position
sir.
unlike
the
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
there
is
some
--
in
the
beacon
theatres,
a
dairy
queen
trilogy,
there
is
language
that
would
indicate
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
there
would
be
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
we
would
say
that
that
would
be
in
discretion
of
the
judge
handling
it,
but
in
this
case
we
would
say
that
the
abatement
would
go
on.
there
is
some
language
that
says
that
the
acquittal
side
is
in
state
until
the
judicial
side,
but
we
are
saying
if
congress
did
not
provide,
which
of
course
is
provided
in
here,
which
is
fatal
flaw.
we
are
saying
that
that
would
be,
the
whole
realm
would
be,
differed
until
after
the
administrative
action
is
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
correct
--
no,
we
would
say
the
administrative
proceeding
would
go
on
and
you
would
have
de
novo
review.
i
am
sorry;
i
interpret
it
wrong.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
i
would
not
think
that
that
would
be
right.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
mr
justice
stewart
there
is
no
provision
in
here
for
jury
trial.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
the
penalty
provision
should
be
held
unconstitutional
without
--
unless
and
until
a
jury
trial
is
provided
at
some
stage
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
by
congress.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
just
like
the
national
labor
relations
board
type
of
proceedings,
seize
and
desist
type
of
proceedings,
and
many
others.
now
then,
the
government
has
cited
cases,
such
as
katchen
v.
landy
which
arises
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
in
which
a
preference
can
be
determined
without
a
jury
trial,
but
there
a
litigant
has
to
voluntary
submit
hisself
to
that
jurisdiction,
similar
can
reasoning
is
on
the
sovereign
immunity
cases,
where
you
go
before
the
court
of
claims.
there
a
litigant
has
to
voluntarily
submit
to
that
jurisdiction.
we
say
that
these
have
no
force
and
effect.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir,
in
a
preference,
in
a
plenary
action
where
you
don’t
have
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
well,
there
you
go,
you
voluntarily
submit,
you
are
declaring
bankrupcy
or
involuntarily.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
involuntary
preference
where
you
are
seeking
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
you
don’t
have
a
jury
trial
for
that.
these
have
been
upheld,
as
i
understand
it,
because
of
the
acquittal
nature
of
an
accounting
of
the
race
in
bankruptcy;
it’s
acquittal
type
of
proceedings
sir.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir,
it’s
a
traditional
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
it
is,
yes
sir.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir.
we
would
like
to
reserve,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
we
have,
in
our
brief,
cited
the
people
versus
one
1941
chevrolet,
i
believe,
where
the
supreme
court
of
california
went
through
this
same
exercise
and
they
went
through
every
state
in
which
they
determined
that
a
suit
for
fine
and
forfeiture
would
have
been
an
action
that
common
law
trialed
by
a
jury.
i
believe
they
cite
some
eleven
states
in
the
actual
cases
in
which
that
occurred.
as
for
the
policy,
i
think
the
majority
said
it
best,
in
the
third
circuit
opinion,
and
footnote
11,
i
believe,
it
was,
when
the
said
they
couldn’t
understand
why
do
novo
review
was
not
provided,
because
it
is
that
the
de
novo
review
far
from
using
it;
it
is
the
availability
of
the
remedy,
and
there
they
analogize
to
a
local
fire
department
that
a
citizen
would
hope
he
would
never
have
to
use
it
but
he
takes
comfort
in
knowing
it’s
there.
now
we
have
cited
that
there
are
only
less
than
50
cases
a
year
hitting
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
limited
review.
it’s
a
mere
speculation
but
i
question
whether
there
would
be
a
title
wave
as
the
government
would
have
us
look
at
and
in
penalty,
in
de
novo
is,
albeit
there
is
only
1.2%,
as
we
also
cited
in
our
brief,
of
all
the
penalty
and
forfeiture
cases
with
all
the
statute
that
have
de
novo
review
now,
including
the
liquor
forfeiture
cases
under
the
19/75
statistics.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
mr.
justice
marshall
so
does
every
other
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir.
so
does
every
other
criminal
penalty
for
which
jury
trial
is
provided.
i
mean,
any
other
penalty
sir?
mr.
mcneill
stokes
of
$500
is
that
--
and
it’s
even
that
--
mr.
mcneill
stokes
we
would
take
the
position
of
that
as
unconstitutional;
that
is
certainly
more
than
a
petty
fine
which
is
my
understanding
of
the
case
as
has
been
defined
that
the
$500
range.
i
could
be
wrong
mr.
justice
white
on
that.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes
sir.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
it’s
in
our
reply
brief,
sir.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
mcneill
stokes
yes,
sir
i
am
sorry.
when
the
government
cites
that
this
would
collapse
the
penalty
structure
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
of
1970,
but
more
fundamentally
it
may
very
well
collapse
a
realistic
seventh
amendment
right
against
when
the
government
seeks
fines
against
its
citizens.
you
know
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
the
balancing
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
we
are
dealing
with
jury
trial.
when
all
is
said
and
done,
it
gets
down
to
this,
you
either
have
the
right
to
jury
trial
when
the
government
seeks
a
fine
against
you
or
you
don’t
have
one.
i
really
believe
that
this
case
is
going
to
stand
as
a
high
water
mark
beyond
which
the
executive
police
power,
government
cannot
go
without
providing
jury
trial
or
be
the
breach
of
interdict
that
creates
a
virtual
title
wave
of
similar
legislation.
we
submit
that
osha
is
the
breach
of
interdict.
we
would
hope
that
dict
would
be
applied
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much,
it’s
at
people;
it’s
page
7
in
our
brief.
