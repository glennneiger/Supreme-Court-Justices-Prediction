mr.

is
there
any
history
of
unions,

mr.
solicitor
general,
my
understanding
is
that
routine
inspections
are
routine;
they
are
regularly
conducted
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
on
a
very
extensive
basis.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
after
there
has
been
an
evidentiary
hearing
before
the
law
judge,
and
letâ€™s
assume,
employer
wishes
to
appeal
to
the
commission,
and
they
had
appealed
as
a
matter
of
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
he
then
appeals
from
the
decision
of
the
law
judge.
