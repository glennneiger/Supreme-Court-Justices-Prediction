justice
potter
stewart
at
what
stage
in
this
procedure,
do
you
think
jury
trial
attaches?
you
haven’t
really
told
us
about
the
procedure
and
as
you
say
it
is
normal,
and
i
wonder,
do
you
think
the
constitution
would
be
satisfied
if
it
provided
a
jury
trial
at
any
stage?
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
describe
a
little
bit?
justice
potter
stewart
before
a
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
submission
of
the
seventh
amendment
would
be
satisfied,
would
it,
if
the
jury
trial
were
provided
either
to
try
the
original
assessment
of
the
penalty
or
by
de
novo
review
later
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
the
seventh
amendment,
in
your
submission,
would
be
satisfied
in
either
event,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
a
court.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
court
of
appeals
review
now,
isn’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
following
up
my
brother
brennan’s
question,
the
issues
would
be
at
least
two
in
your
submission,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
and
that
assuming
there
was
a
finding,
there
was
a
violation
of
what
the
amount
of
the
penalty
should
be?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
normally
a
jury
assess
damages
and
normally
a
judge
imposes,
if
it’s
in
his
discretion,
to
impose
punishment,
which
would
it
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
the
fact
of
violation
not
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whether
or
not
the
monetary
award
was
--
not
what
a
monetary
award
should
be
or
the
penalty
should
be?
justice
potter
stewart
usually
the
jury
determines
the
amount
too,
except
when
it’s
a
criminal
punishment,
then,
where
there
is
some
exceptions
in
some
states,
in
most
of
the
states
i
think
the
judge
determines
what
the
sentence
shall
be.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
which
would
it
be
here
in
your
submission?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
court
finally
addresses
you
on
that
and
we
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
that
question.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event
on
this
question,
the
seventh
amendment
question,
would
it
be
open
to
the
jury
to
decide
how
much
the
penalty
should
be
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
that
much
you
think
is
triable
by
a
jury
under
the
seventh
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
your
claim
that
because
of
the
failure
to
provide
a
jury
trial
at
some
stage
of
the
proceeding
here,
this
legislation
is
simply
constitutionally
invalid
or
is
it
your
position
that
judicial
decisions
can
sooner
patch
it
up?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
other
words,
is
it
your
position
that
--
under
your
submission
should
the
court
hold
this
legislation
to
be
invalid
constitutionally
and
then
leave
it
to
congress
to
enact
some
new
law
providing,
at
some
stage,
the
gain
at
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
by
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
just
part
of
history,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
test
as
a
matter
of
--
is
a
historic
test,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
in
addition
to
the
penalties
that
mr.
stokes
was
talking
about,
that
is,
just
the
imposition
of
$2,000,
$3,500
whatever,
and
that’s
what
he
was
talking
about
that
that
requires
a
jury
trial,
as
i
understand
it.
but
then
in
addition
to
that
aren’t
there
sanctions
for
failure
of
the
employer
to
obey
an
abatement
order
which
would
be
much
more
than
in
the
nature
of
a
contempt
and
therefore
perhaps
not
triable
by
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
they
would
be
left
untouched.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
as
a
matter
of
practical
operation
and
administration
of
this
statute
nothing
really
happens
until,
in
most
cases
at
least,
until
an
employee
is
injured
or
killed;
that
seems
to
be
the
case
in
these
two
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
with
that
many
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
it
comes
out
of
informer
or
something,
but
generally,
these
are
not
--
are
these
just
routine,
and
are
there
any
just
routine
inspections?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
i
think
what
happened
in
both
of
these
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
you
know
mr.
solicitor
general,
has
the
government
ever
before
taken
the
position
even
argumentatively
that
the
seventh
amendment
does
not
apply
to
any
civil
action
in
which
the
united
states
is
one
of
the
parties?
justice
potter
stewart
somebody
got
a
very
bright
idea
over
in
your
office,
then
you
just
pursued
it.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
because
that’s
in
a
very
extreme
position
and
a
fascinating
one,
i
must
say
or
it’s
contrary
to
at
least
a
good
deal
of
dicta
in
this
court’s
decisions
and
another
court’s
decisions.
justice
potter
stewart
and
contrary
to
good
many
assumptions
that
we
have
made,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
know,
but
if
you
spent
about
half
of
your
brief
on
that
proposition,
then
it’s
an
extraordinary
one.
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
have
lost
full
of
paradoxes
and
the
fact
is
as
the
seventh
amendment
guarantees
a
jury
trial
in
civil
actions
and
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
guarantee
a
jury
trial
in
criminal
cases
and
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
at
least
implicitly
based
upon
historic
reasons,
do
not
provide
for
a
jury
trial
in
a
contempt
action.
now
the
court
has
subsequently
said
that
if
the
imprisonment
is
longer
than
six
month,
there
is
a
jury
trial
in
the
contempt
action,
but
generally
speaking
historically
there
never
was
a
jury
trial
in
action
for
contempt
of
court,
and
this
suggests
history.
justice
potter
stewart
not
logic
maybe
and
maybe
paradoxical
but
it’s
history.
as
also
it
evolves
the
specific
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
for
better
or
for
worse;
maybe
they
are
paradoxical,
maybe
inconsistent,
but
there
they
are.
justice
potter
stewart
the
test
is
whether
or
not
it’s
a
petty
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
stokes
you
call
our
attention
to
a
case
called
people
against
chevrolet
or
plymouth
or
something,
i
don’t
find
it
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
reply
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
