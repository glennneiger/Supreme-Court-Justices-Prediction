going
back
to
my
brother
marshall’s
question,
what
kind
of
trial
would
you
have
in
the
district
court?
what
would
be
the
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
res
judicata
at
all?

mr.
solicitor,
you
are
not
suggesting
if
the
abutment
of
provisions
are
not
valuable
in
the
enforcement.

j.
brennan,
jr.

can’t
think
it
--
but
i
don’t
see
it
cited
and

not
more
than
