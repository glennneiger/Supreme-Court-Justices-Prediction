william

rehnquist
what’s
your
interpretation
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
nlrb
in
that
case
had
ordered
only
back
pay?
would
you
say
they
would
have
had
to
go
to
the
court
and
be
tried
to
a
jury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
in
your
ftc
enforcement
proceedings,
they
go
the
court
of
appeals
and
if
you
disobey
an
order,
the
court
of
appeals,
enforcing
the
administrative
order,
you
are
subject
to
contempt
and
you
don’t
have
a
jury
trial
in
the
court
of
appeals,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
the
power
that
government,
under
the
commerce
clause,
so
much
less
than
its
power
under
tax
clause
or
under
the
immigration
clause,
if
there
is
an
immigration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
leave
the
abatement
and
all
the
other
kind
of
orders
perfectly
constitutional,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
public
right
analogy,
it
seems
to
me,
that
creates
a
rather
strange
hiatus,
because
you
have
a
--
when
the
government
proceeds
against
the
person
criminally,
they
clearly,
the
defendant
clearly
has
the
right
to
jury
trial
under
the
sixth
amendment.
when
a
private
individual
pursues
another
private
individual
for
damages
in
the
federal
courts,
you
can
see
that
the
seventh
amendment
guarantees
that
jury
trial,
and
yet,
you
are
having
this
kind
of
intermediate
classification,
no
jury
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
you
would
hate
to
see
the
law
developed
in
this
way
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
historical
provision
adopted
in
1791
and
it
is
not
a
broad
general
provision
at
all.
it
is
not
like
the
due
process
clause;
it’s
really
a
question
of
is
it
or
isn’t
it.
isn’t
it
rather
than
something
we
had
a
great
del
of
discretion
in
deciding
whether
it
should
or
should
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
in
response
of
justice
marshall’s
question
that
we
could
say
a
jury
trial
is
required
and
you
would
nonetheless
have
the
administrative
law
judge,
someone
of
an
ire.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
couldn’t
have
them
imposed
civil
penalty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
again
is
justifiable
on
a
quite
independent
grounds
that
frequently
when
you
are
counterclaim
sued,
you
can
be
treated
as
if
you
had
brought
the
suit
in
the
first
instance,
that
you
maybe
subject
to
many
rules
that
you
wouldn’t
be
subject
to
if
the
counterclaim
were
entirely
independent
of
the
original
suit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn’t
a
classical
action
for
damages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
can
treat
it
as
an
actual
reaffirmation
of
the
contract;
the
renegotiation
board
then.
