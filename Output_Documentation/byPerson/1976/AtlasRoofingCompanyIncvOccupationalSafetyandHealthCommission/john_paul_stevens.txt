justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stokes,
going
to
your
broad
position
that
you
can’t
commit
this
power
of
executives,
supposing,
there
were
that
two
stage
procedure,
where
there
was,
first,
the
determination
of
the
violation
and
an
order
to
comply;
and
then
a
refusal
to
comply
with
that
order.
could
the
executive
branch
then
impose
penalties
for
that
by
analogy
to
contempt
for
violation
of
an
injunction
without
a
jury
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that’s
not
directly
involved,
and
i
am
wondering
if
your
argument
would
cover
that
situation
as
well.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
contend
there
would
be
jury
trial
required
in
that
procedure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
wouldn’t
there
be,
why
wouldn’t
the
answer
to
the
jury
trial
requirement
be
that
that’s
analogous
to
an
equitable
proceeding
where
there
has
never
been
a
requirement
of
a
jury
trial
and
contempt
for
violation
of
the
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
violation
of
an
injunction,
the
suit
for
money
for
violating
an
injunction
would
not
be
a
classic
suit
at
common
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stokes
is
it
part
of
your
position
that
this
kind
of
proceeding
must
be
committed
to
an
article
iii
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
if
your
argument
is
valid,
i
think
it
would
follow,
would
it
not
that
federal
trade
commission
could
be
given
the
power
to
imposed
penalties
for
price
fixing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
of
$10
million.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
$10
million,
because
the
amount
is
irrelevant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
do
agree
that
your
argument
would
apply
with
equal
force
to
the
federal
trade
commission
imposing
a
penalty
for
price
fixing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general
it
only
be
impossible
that
the
extended
penalties
were
imposed
in
the
first
instances,
isn’t
that
true?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
article
applied
in
personam
of
judgements
as
well
as
(voice
overlap)
that
you
are
pointed
at.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
with
your
emphasis
on
history
i
wonder
because
it
was
really
not
discussed
in
the
briefs
and
i
am
not
sufficiently
familiar
to
know,
does
the
history
of
the
seventh
amendment
indicate
perhaps
that
one
of
the
concerns
of
that
amendment
was
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
states
and
one
reason
was
that
the
one
thing
the
drafters
of
the
amendment
were
concerned
with
was
the
problem
with
excessive
federal
power,
and
mightn’t
that
be
relevant
to
our
problem
here?
