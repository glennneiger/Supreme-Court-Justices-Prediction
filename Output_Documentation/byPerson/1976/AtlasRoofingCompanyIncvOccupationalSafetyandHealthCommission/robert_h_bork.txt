mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
apparent
the
acceptance
of
the
petitioner’s
contention
that
a
jury
trial
is
required
by
the
seventh
amendment
before
any
civil
penalty
maybe
proposed
under
the
act,
would
go
a
long
way
towards
collapsing
this
program.
this
should
be
remembered
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
act
that
covers
over
five
million
work
places
and
65
million
employees,
and
a
jury
trial
requirement
would
make
it
effectively
impossible
to
administer
osha
effectively
and
uniformly
as
cases
would
back
up,
jury
trial
cases
would
back
up
before
more
than
400
district
court
judges.
i
should
correct
one
statement.
this
tribunal,
we
are
dealing
with
here,
the
review
commission,
is
not
an
executive
branch
tribunal;
it
is
an
independent
agency.
now,
there
is
a
very
good
reason
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
are
valuable,
but
i
think
they
are
not
as
valuable
as
they
--
nearly
as
valuable
as
they
are
with
this
penalty
proceeding.
an
employer
--
now
with
1300
compliance
inspectors
and
5
million
workplaces
in
the
country,
it’s
quite
obvious
that
it
would
be
--
the
abatement
procedures
alone
would
not
be
terribly
effective
in
achieving
a
national
standard
of
health
and
safety
in
workplaces.
the
employer
has
no
incentive
whatsoever
to
comply
the
mentary
incentive,
no
private
incentives
to
comply
with
the
statute
under
these
regulations.
beforehand,
you
can
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
there
are
other
sanctions.
once
the
order
has
been
enforced
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
is
then
enforced
and
there
is
a
sanction
in
the
nature
of
contempt
just
as
there
is
in
a
federal
trade
commission
order.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
would
be
left
untouched
by
this
indeed
they
might
be
much
more
severe
than
any
penalty
provided
here.
my
point,
mr.
just
stewart,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
simply
is
that
the
existence
of
a
civil
penalty
gives
employers
an
incentive
to
comply
before
an
inspector
comes
around
and
finds
a
violation
and
issues
an
abatement
order.
absent
the
penalty,
the
act
would
be
much
less
effective,
because
the
only
way
--
nothing
happens
to
you
until
you
have
an
abatement
order
and
the
court
of
appeals
enforces,
and
then
you
comply,
so
that
the
--
so
the
penalty
feature
is
an
integral
part
of
this
statute
and
that’s
why
i
say
that
acceptance
of
petitioner’s
argument
would
go
a
long
way
towards
collapsing
this
program
as
an
effective
national
program.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
probably
is
the
case,
but
i
cannot
speak
with
authority
to
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
that
would
draw
the
attention
of
a
program
which
has
a
relatively
small
number
of
inspectors.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
there
are.
there
are
some
routine
inspections
but
obviously
where
there
has
been
an
injury;
it
is
like
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
both
of
these
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know,
but
i
assume
there
is
--
i
am
certain
that
they
are
--
i
do
not
have
an
example
at
my
command
but
i
am
certain
that
that
takes
place.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
are,
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
they
are.
yes
mr.
justice
powell.
i
was
suggesting
that,
you
would
get
to
a
employer
faster
if
there
has
been
a
serious
accident.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
as
i
understand
the
scheme
of
the
commission,
it
may
review
or
may
not,
but
then
the
employer
--
if
the
commission
does
not
review,
i
understand
the
employer
has
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s,
as
i
understand
it
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
of
there
is
another
case
like
that
the
turner
elkhorn
case
where
the
same
lack
of
a
challenge
to
a
scheme
of
this
sort
was
present.
i
do
not
think
the
court
addressed
it
directly,
and
therefore,
i
think
we
have
been
assuming
that
the
seventh
amendment
poses
no
bar
in
these
cases,
but
those
cases
don’t
directly
assess,
they
just
assumed
it.
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
is,
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
both
history,
i
think
there
is
a
square
conflict
between
the
petitioners
and
ourselves
about
what
history
shows.
and
there
is
also
a
long
line
of
decisions
in
this
court
which
we
think
squarely
governed
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it’s
entirely
true
that
a
number
of
regulatory
schemes
will
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
as
we
know,
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky
now
is
i
think
very
backed
up
with
penalty
cases.
acceptance
of
this
contention
in
a
society,
which
intends
to
regulate
the
environment
and
the
safety
and
health
and
other
matters,
would
really
i
think
pose
an
impossible
problem
for
the
courts
in
the
future.
if
regulation,
all
civil
penalties
had
to
move
through
jury
trials,
i
don’t
think
the
federal
jurisdiction
system
could
handle
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don’t
think
the
amount
of
the
penalty
is
the
crucial
factor.
i
think
the
crucial
factors
here
are
the
--
this
is
a
public
right
case
rather
than
a
private
right
case.
it’s
not
a
litigation
between
the
two
individuals
which
is,
somebody
has
attempted
to
move
into
an
administrative
agency.
you
can
do
some
of
that
i
think
under
the
constitution
but
there
maybe
limits
to
how
far
congress
can
go
there,
but
this
is
a
public
right
case.
secondly,
i
think
i
will
advance,
what
i
think
is
a
solid
although
perhaps
somewhat
noble
proposition,
but
i
think
it’s
solid
in
history
that
the
seventh
amendment
was
never
intended
to
apply
to
a
case
in
which
the
government
was
a
party.
and
thirdly,
i
think,
it
is
also
true
that
the
penalties
here
are
intertwined
with
equitable
remedies
and
in
itself,
there
is
a
great
discretion
over
the
size
of
the
penalty,
and
is
intertwined
with
the
abatement
action
and
supports
the
abatement
action.
so
i
think
that
under
the
jones
&
laughlin
case
or
under
the
katchen
case,
i
think
that
line
of
cases
too
support
this;
those
are
three
reasons
why
i
think
--
i
don’t
offer
any
of
those
propositions
that
is
that
it’s
a
public
right
case
where
the
government
is
a
party
and
that
it’s
intertwined
with
an
equitable
remedy.
perhaps,
those
three
propositions
do
not
completely
exhaust
the
field
of
the
seventh
amendment
and
explain
all
practices.
but
we
author
them
as
analytical
factors,
and
when
we
look
at,
you
might
think
they
are
the
major
analytical
factors
come
out
of
the
history
and
of
the
cases,
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
them,
you
discover
that
this
case
lies
right
at
the
core
of
the
kind
of
case
that
may
be
moved
by
congress
into
administrative
adjudication.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
quite
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
if
we
look
--
one
reason
that
is
historical
and
the
other
reason
is
a
policy
region.
we
are
flattening
in
conflict
petitions
on
the
history
and
we
would
refer
the
court
to
the
history
as
developed
in
the
article
by
frankfurter
in
corkan
(ph),
which
appears,
is
cited
at
page
81
of
our
brief,
and
many
other
places,
which
shows
that
historically,
in
this
country,
both
civil
and
criminal
penalties
were
administered
by
magistrates
and
by
non
jury
means,
before
the
revolution
and
after
the
revolution.
often
a
fine
is
up
to
500
pounds
which
was
quite
a
good
deal
of
money
in
that
time.
so,
historically
i
think
we
have
recognized
a
public
policy
area,
a
public
right
area
where
no
jury
trial
was
required
and
the
reason
for
that
historically
and
today,
i
think,
is
quite
plain,
and
that
reason
is
that
we
want
speed
of
administration,
we
want
informality,
we
want
expertise
in
the
tribunal,
which
we
have
develop
her
in
this
review
commission
and
we
want
uniformity
of
decisions,
when
we
are
administering
a
public
right
policy
across
the
nation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
penalties
for
--
federal
trade
commission
could
be
--
civil
penalty?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
i
think
amount
probably
is
relevant
mr.
justice
stevens,
at
least
i
have
never
seen
a
case
in
which
the
amount
was
thought
to
be
relevant.
for
example,
helvering
against
mithcell.
a
tax
assessment
and
then
an
additional
assessment
for
fraud
of
50%
which
amount
at
about
$365,000,
which
this
court
held
as
a
civil
penalty.
and
it
was
administratively
imposed
through
a
tribunal,
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
which
has
an
adjudicative
structure
just
like
the
osha
structure.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
would
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
so
far
as
i
know
that
position
mr.
justice
stewart
was
evolved
in
my
office
primarily
by
mr.
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
got
a
very
bright
idea
and
then
left
for
england
with
me
to
argue
the
basic.[laughter]
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
yes,
it
is
that
we
recognize
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
that
the
demonstration,
that
our
case
doest
not
rise
a
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it’s
extraordinary,
but
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
if
one
looks
at
the
way
the
set
of
the
memo
is
framed.
the
preceding
guarantees
of
jury
trials.
it
obviously
applied
to
private
litigation
in
the
states.
the
proposals
from
the
states
for
the
seventh
amendment
only
apply
to
the
private
litigation.
thomas
jefferson,
rely
heavily
upon
the
virginia
declaration
of
rights
which
is
confined
to
private
litigation.
thomas
jefferson
proposed,
as
we
noted
in
our
brief,
a
jury
trial
for
every
tax,
every
imbursement,
every
penalty
that
was
rejected.
i
think
the
history
is
fairly
clear;
i
think
it’s
unambiguous.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
chief
justice,
that’s
why
i
pointed
out
that
we
have
three
propositions,
all
of
which
point
in
the
direction
of
sustaining
these
judgements
below.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
i
would
hate
to
see
the
law
developed
in
a
way,
that
is,
there
must
be
a
jury
and
there
must
be
an
article
iii
judge,
because
i
think
with
the
regulation
that
exist
in
the
society
and
the
one
that
fairly
predict
will
come
to
exist
in
the
society,
that
would
be
a
terrible
blow
to
the
federal
judiciary.
it
would
make
it
impossible,
for
example,
for
alternative
types
of
tribunals
to
be
devised
to
deal
with
repetitive
factual
claims
of
relatively
simple
nature
and
i
don’t
think
that
federal
judiciary
could
handle
the
flow
of
litigation
that
regulation
would
then
generate.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
what
i
think
mr.
justice
stevens
that
that’s
going
to
be
a
fairly
useful
feature
because
--
unless
we
multiply
the
number
of
enforcement
personnel
enormously.
it
is
simply
impossible
to
deal
with
these
wide
ranging
factual
problems,
as
i
say
in
5
million
workplaces,
unless
there
is
some
incentive
to
comply
other
than
the
fact
that
an
agent
showed
up
and
issued
--
and
an
abatement
order
issued.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
quite
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
that;
i
was
replying
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
of
whether
if
a
jury
trial
provided,
it
would
have
to
be
provided
in
an
article
iii
form,
and
i
was
simply
saying
that
i
hope
the
law
would
not
develop
in
that
way
because
i
do
not
think
the
federal
judiciary
can
handle
it,
but
i
am
quite
agree
with
you
that
the
history
and
the
cases
controlled.
it
is
not
that
whole.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
hope
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
position
could
be
sustained
in
another
case
because
of
the
reason
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
that
isn’t
a
case
we
have
before
us
today.
i
think
it’s
rather
clear
in
terms
of
history
and
in
terms
of
the
prior
cases
that
no
jury
is
required
in
this
case.
now
the
petitioner’s
contentions,
i
must
say,
are
kind
of
like
a
loose
canon,
because
they
don’t
really
draw
out
the
implications
of
their
arguments,
and
the
acceptance
of
their
arguments
really
have
extraordinary
results.
for
example,
there
is,
in
their
brief,
a
contention
that
somehow
the
commerce
clause
is
not
a
very
plenary
power;
it’s
a
plenary
power
but
it’s
not
as
plenary
other
powers.
it’s
a
metaphysical
argument
that
i
will
follow
with
great
facility,
but
that
under
other
powers
congress
may
delegate
to
administrative
adjudication,
factual
determinations
just
like
this.
but
they
may
not
under
the
commerce
clause
because
a
commerce
clause
is
something
that’s
stronger
enough
to
do
it.
and
then
they
argue
that
if
it’s
something
that
could
be
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy
and
it’s
a
commerce
power,
not
only
do
you
need
a
jury,
but
you
need
an
article
iii
form,
which
i
think
is
quite
wrong.
and
i
should
point
out
that
not
only
is
it
quite
wrong,
but
everybody
have
been
overlooking
that
argument
for
all
these
years
because
if
it’s
true,
then
all
of
the
agencies
based
on
the
commerce
power
are
in
constitutional
have
been
for
years.
that
is,
you
could
not
have
the
icc,
the
sec,
the
ftc,
the
cab,
the
fcc
and
so
forth,
all
of
the
commerce
clause
agencies.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
it’s
there
argument,
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist
it
is
broader.
they
say
if
it’s
a
case
or
controversy,
then
you
can’t
take
it
out
of
an
article
iii
tribunal,
unless
you
are
using
a
power
other
than
the
commerce
clause.
now,
it’s
a
complicated
argument
and
one
does
not
follow
all
of
its
steps
but
nevertheless
that’s
where
it
comes
out,
which
means
jury
or
no.
all
of
these
factual
determinations
being
made
by
all
of
these
agencies
under
the
commerce
clause
are
being
unconstitutionally
made
if
they
look
like
a
case
or
controversy.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
marshall
that
maybe
their
point
or
maybe
that
they
have
two
points,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
at
one
point
in
their
reply
brief
beginning
about
page
33
i
think.
they
are
really
arguing
that
factual
determinations
of
a
case
in
controversy
nature
must
be
made
in
article
iii
tribunals
and
may
not
be
removed
under
the
commerce
clause
although
they
could
be
removed
for
reason
which
are
not
apparent
under
the
revenue
power
or
under
the
immigration
power
i
thought.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that’s
what,
they
have
loosed
upon
in
their
argument.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
white
but
i
think
it
is
in
the
brief
and
i
thought
i
had
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
argument
is
somewhat
diffused
and
i
think
they
have
implications
that
haven’t
been
analyzed
fully.
but
in
any
event,
on
the
history
point
i
must
--
there
is
no
time
to
argue
it
orally,
i
must
ask
that
the
court
refer
to
the
frankfurther
in
corkan
(ph)
article
which
establishes
i
think
beyond
the
doubt
that
civil
penalties,
much
larger
than
this
in
the
real
money
of
the
time,
were
regularly
and
routinely
administered
without
juries
in
colonial
times
and
after
the
revolution.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh
yes,
oh
yes,
they
were
--
i
understand
mr.
justice
stevens
but
the
fines
and
penalties
and
so
forth
being
administered
were
in
personam
and
they
were
regulatory.
regulating
hunting
and
fishing,
liquor,
and
a
variety
of
other
fields
of
endeavor.
so
i
think
the
history
is
quite
clear.
i
think
it’s
also
quite
clear
that
the
case
law
is
against
petitioners.
jones
&
laughlin,
of
course,
is
a
case
which
i
think
is
directly
on
point
here
because,
as
i
have
suggested,
the
money
penalty
here
is
as
intertwined
with
the
equitable
remedies
here
as
was
the
case
in
jones
&
laughlin.
so
that
the
rationale
of
jones
&
laughlin
directly
applies
here.
in
addition
jones
&
laughlin
suggest,
as
we
said
in,
southall
realty
and
curtis
against
loether
that
if
it’s
a
public
right
case,
an
administrative
agency
case,
you
still
don’t
need
a
jury
and
that’s
true
here
also
and
jones
&
laughlin,
of
course,
is
an
administrative
determination
made
by
a
tribunal
or
by
an
agency
set
up
under
the
commerce
clause.
so
it
is
not
at
all
one
of
these
other
powers
which
petitioners
find
so
much
more
powerful
than
they
find
the
commerce
clause.
helvering
against
mitchell,
i
would
quite
suggest,
is
directly
in
point
also
has
an
administrative
structure
and
a
procedures
for
fact
finding
which
is
almost
identical
to
that
here,
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
the
history
and
the
policy
and
the
case
law
all
suggest
affirmance
of
this
case.
petitioners
have
largely
ignored
that
their
reply
to
our
argument
about
american
legal
history
is
to
ignore
the
goldschmidt
report
and
to
ignore,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
to
ignore
frankfurter
in
corkan
(ph),
and
they
discuss
instead
of
american
legal
history,
the
practice
in
english
court
of
exchequer.
their
reply
to
our
policy
arguments,
i
think,
is
essentially
to
declare
that
practical
matters
are
unworthy
of
discussion
in
the
constitutional
context.
i
think
they
are
not.
in
their
argument
on
the
law,
insofar
as
it
proceeds
from
article
iii,
is
unique
and
would
have
devastating
results
for
administrative
agencies.
insofar
as
it
proceeds
by
distinguishing
the
cases,
i
suggest
that
the
distinction
has
not
been
made
that
this
case
is
identical
to
any
number
of
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that’s
a
case
mr.
justice
brennan,
which
his
case
my
memory
be,
but
that
was
the
case
that
came
up
in
argument,
the
muniz
against
hoffman
case,
which
was
the
question
of
criminal
contempt.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
think
about;
i
think
about
to
be
able
to
help
you
out
sir.[laughter].
well
it
says
here
to
the
last
name
is
hamlin
(ph),
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
hamlin
(ph)
(inaudible),
but
i
remember
we
discussed
that
in
the
muniz
against
hoffman
case.
and
that
raises
an
additional
point
i
think
that
ought
to
be
made.
there
would
be
ought
to
be
some
congruence
between
the
sixth
amendments
and
seventh.
it’s
quite
clear
here
that
if
congress
had
decided
to
be
really
tribonian
about
these
matters.
it
could
have
provided
for
six
month
imprisonment
and
no
jury
would
have
been
required.
muniz
against
hoffman
suggests
where
a
$10,000
contempt
sanction,
criminal
content
sanction
against
the
union,
was
upheld
is
not
requiring
a
jury
trial
under
the
constitution.
that
cases
suggests
that,
had
these
penalties,
$600
and
$
5,000
against
cooperations,
bill
accessed
criminally,
there
probably
would
not
have
been
in
the
jury
trial
and
it
surely
cannot
be
that
we
have
the
paradox
that
a
congress
precised
to
proceed
with
a
civil
action
rather
the
criminal
action,
thereby
finds
itself
hampered
and
the
greater
procedural
protections
are
required
because
it
decided
to
give
us
a
civil
action
instead
of
a
criminal
action.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
quite
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
my
point
mr.
justice
stewart
was
that
it
would
be
paradoxical
and
that
the
paradox
need
not
be
created.
it
need
not
be
created
not
because
of
the
sixth
amendment
but
need
not
be
created
because
of
the
history
of
the
seventh,
which
aside
from
our
argument
that
the
amendment
never
applies
when
the
government
is
a
party.
clearly,
i
think,
the
history
shows
that
where
public
right
is
concerned,
these
kinds
of
penalties
have
been
imposed
without
a
jury
trial
throughout
our
history,
and
my
primary
reliance
is
upon
history
and
up
on
the
decisions
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
stewart
rather
than
upon
an
inference
in
sixth
amendment.
i
don’t
believe
in
multiplying
paradoxes.
needlessly,
and
i
am
really
pointing
out
that
i
think
this
paradox
need
not
be
created.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
might
be;
there
is
no
discussion
anywhere,
so
far
as
i
am
aware
mr.
justice
stevens
there
is
no
discussion
in
the
drafting
or
the
framing
of
the
proposals
that
go
into
the
seventh
amendment,
nor
in
the
ratification
debates
of
the
seventh
amendment.
there
is
no
discussion
of
anybody’s
fear
of
the
government
as
litigant,
and
that
this
is,
in
any
way,
designed
to
confine,
to
cure
or
to
safeguard
that.
all
of
the
discussion
is
about
proposals
which
purport
to
save
the
jury
trial
in
suits
between
man
and
the
man
which
we
think
is
a
phrase
that
only
means
private
litigation,
or
in
suits
respecting
property.
now,
of
course,
the
suits
respecting
property
dropped
out;
it
was
never
proposed
by
madison
when
he
drafted
the
beginning
of
the
seventh
amendment.
so
that
this
idea
that
somehow
the
seventh
amendment
was
to
protect
the
citizen
against
the
federal
government
i
think
is
quite
wrong.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
debates
about
that
and
in
fact,
as
frankfurter
in
corkan
(ph)
pointed
out,
i
hate
to
keep
coming
back
to
that
article,
but
it
is
the
mind
of
information
of
this
subject.
the
column
is
--
pardon
me
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
column
is
worth,
entirely
used
to
government
litigation
in
which
fines
and
penalties
were
imposed
for
regulatory
purposes
without
a
jury,
because
they
wanted
the
speed
they
wanted
uniformity.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
are
indeed.
the
argument
is
made
mr.
chief
justice
that
those
were
not
suits
at
common
law,
because
the
government
has
sovereign
immunity.
i
am
not
entirely
persuaded
by
that
argument,
but,
for
example,
if
you
sue
the
government
in
the
court
of
claims
and
the
government
counterclaims
for
an
amount
much,
much
larger
than
your
original
claim,
nevertheless
no
jury
is
required,
and
that
counterclaim,
of
course,
has
nothing
to
do
with
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
would
probably
not
be
the
case
if
one
sued
in
equity
and
somebody
came
back
with
a
damage
action
and
the
first
party
wanted
a
trial
as
to
the
damage
action.
but,
in
any
event,
my
real
point
can
be
illustrated
in
another
way,
which
is,
for
example,
the
renegotiation
litigation.
it
comes
from
renegotiation
board
into
the
court
of
claims;
it’s
only
a
question
of
whether
the
government,
as
a
contract,
is
paying
too
much
or
not;
no
jury
trial.
i
don’t
know
that
that
kind
of
thing
can
be
explained.
we
have
got
lots
of
practices
of
that
sort.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
what
sense
that
is
not
a
classical
action
for
damages.
certainly
that
is
not
a
classical
action
for
damages
and
therefore
not
a
suit
at
common
law,
as
the
seventh
amendment
requires
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
then
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
these
penalties
here
are
also
not
actions
for
damages
and
are
not
suits
at
common
law.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
one
can,
i
suppose,
apply
that
term
to
it
but
the
fact
is
that
the
government
is
going
for
money
from
a
contractor
and
no
jury
is
required;
no
jury
is
required
in
the
government’s
counterclaim.
there
are
lots
of
these
things
which
i
think
are
best
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
government
is
a
party,
but
this
court
need
not
accept
that
principle
in
its
totality
to
decide
this
case,
because
i
think
all
of
the
three
principled
discussed
here
point
to
the
fact
that
this
case
is
at
the
core
of
congress’s
power
to
move
the
dispute
into
administrative
adjudication.
