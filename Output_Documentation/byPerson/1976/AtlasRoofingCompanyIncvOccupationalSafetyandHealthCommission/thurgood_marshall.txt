before
whom,
a
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
may
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
at
district
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
court
of
appeals
even
have
a
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
universal
camera.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
in
your
case
if
the
ruling
is
that
you
seize
and
desist
what
you
are
doing,
put
your
place
in
safe
order,
stop
killing
people,
and
incidentally
pay
$5,000
fine,
you
are
not
contesting
the
whole
first
part,
you
are
contesting
the
last
part.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
rest
is
okay
without
a
jury
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
old
traditional
case
where
you
get
an
injunction
and
damages,
you
say
that
in
the
second
part
you
have
that
with
jury
and
in
the
first
part
you
don’t.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr
stokes
you
keep
saying
being
realistic.
if
you
go
before
district
judge
and
the
district
judge,
without
a
jury,
puts
a
$5,000
fine
on
your
client;
that
would
be
bad,
right?
yet
if
you
go
before
a
jury
and
the
jury
says
that
she
should
be
fined
something
and
the
same
judge
is
your
$5,000
fine,
you
would
not
complaint,
something
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it’s
something
wrong,
you
still
get
$5,000.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
misunderstood.
i
was
trying
to
get
you
to
say
the
jury
set
the
amount
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
one
other
point,
if
we
have
to
have
a
jury
trial,
do
you
agree
that
it
has
to
be
an
article
iii
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
what
it
was
that
the
agencies
could
do
anything
that
an
equity
court
could
do.
what
couldn’t
do
what
a
lower
court
would
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
say,
they
say
that
and
that
closes
up
all
the
agencies,
and
say
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
the
government’s
position
to
be
that
the
possibility
of
a
fine
would
be
persuasive
to
augment
reading
the
act
and
following
it,
and
that
wouldn’t
be
true
if
the
only
penalty
would
be
if
he
violated
the
act
and
everything
in
the
world
went
wrong,
then
eventually
if
the
court
of
appeals
around
to
it,
he
would
be
put
on
an
order,
and
his,
the
government’s
position,
that
the
they
first
does
tend
to
make
the
employer
follow
the
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
to
that,
don’t
you?
