chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
75-746,
atlas
roofing
against
the
occupational
safety
and
health
commission
and
the
related
case
irey
against
the
commission.
mr.
stokes
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
limit
your
argument
to
cases
where
the
sanction
is
a
money
sanction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
recognize
that
the
administrative
regulatory
agencies
can
sometimes
decide
the
questions
involve
not
$5,000
but
millions
of
dollars
without
the
intervention
of
a
jury
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general,
in
national
independent
coal
operators
case
last
year
against
the
secretary
of
interior.
i
don’t
recall
whether
you
are
with
that
or
not,
but
there
was
no
question
raised
in
that
case
here
about
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
where
there
was
an
administrative
penalty,
only
the
question
of
whether
explicit
findings
were
required.
i
noticed
you
cite
that
case
but
your
friend
does
not.
how
do
you
think
that
varies
on
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
interrupt
you
once
more,
mr.
solicitor
general.
if
your
friend
prevails
here,
then
someone
in
future
can
certainly
raise
this
question
of
the
jury
trial
with
reference
to
the
coal
mining
safety
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
just
standing
the
opinion,
our
last
year’s
opinion,
it
has
no
reference
to
it,
because
obviously
the
parties
didn’t
raise
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assuming
that
your
position
is
correct
as
applied
to
the
limits
of
the
penalty
in
this
case
under
this
statute,
do
you
think
that
would
be
true
without
reference
with
the
amount
of
the
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
do
not
need
to
accept
your
broad
sweetening
argument
in
order
to
sustain
your
position,
do
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
we
--
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
these
matters
of
speed
and
convenience
underlying
the
decision
of
congress
when
they
passed
the
trucker
act
and
the
federal
tort
claims
act
to
have
no
juries
in
those
cases
which
are,
of
course,
are
strictly
civil
cases,
aren’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
stokes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
75-746,
atlas
roofing
against
occupational
safety
and
health
review
board
and
the
related
case
of
75-748,
along
with
an
unrelated
case
75-1753
santa
fe
industries
against
green
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
