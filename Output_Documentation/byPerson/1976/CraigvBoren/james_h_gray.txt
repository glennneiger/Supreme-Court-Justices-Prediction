mr.
james
h.
gray
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
james
gray
and
i
am
here
representing
the
state
of
oklahoma.
i
feel
that
the
state
can
summarize
this
position
rather
briefly.
the
trial
court
was
presented
with
a
attack
on
a
state
statute
which
as
counsel
for
the
appellants
has
indicated
limits
the
purchase
of
3.2
beer
by
weight
to
boys
until
they
are
21
and
girls
until
they
are
18.
counsel
for
the
appellants
presumes
to
know
the
exact
reasons
for
this
legislation,
i
will
make
no
assertion.
the
citation
and
authority
that
i
recall
was
a
newspaper
article
in
his
brief.
but
evidence
was
put
on
by
the
state,
statistical
in
nature
which
we
believe
shows
a
differences
in
this
limited
age
group
of
18
and
20-year-olds
involving
primarily
traffic,
involving
i
think
in
terms
of
the
state
interest
a
desire
to
reduce
and
to
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
your
honor,
i
am
not
able
to
say.
oklahoma
does
not
key
committee
records
legislative
history
as
does
congress
and
i
do
not
know.
mr.
james
h.
gray
we
have
nothing
in
the
form
of
legislative
documentation
of
committee
reports
etcetera,
etcetera.
the
state
is
offered
what
it
believes
to
be
a
very
reasonable
basis
for
the
law
and
for
which
the
legislature
undoubtedly
passed
it
but
we
cannot,
now
we
are
not
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
that
is
for
the
judgment,
your
honor
of
our
office
in
?
well
that
is
on
our
history.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
it
is.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
do
not
know.
mr.
gilbert
says
it
so.
i
am
unable
to
refute
his
statement
but
i
have
no
assurance
of
my
own
if
this
was
the
case.
i
think
oklahoma
was
traditional
in
its
treatment
of
the
age
of
majority
since
it
is
stated
within
1907
being
18
for
girls
and
21
for
boys.
it
is
significant
i
think
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
in
1972,
the
legislature
amended
this
statute
which
defined
minors
for
most
of
all
purposes
and
changed
it
to
18
for
boys
and
girls.
mr.
james
h.
gray
but
retained
it
for
this
statute
by
enacting
a
new
statute.
mr.
james
h.
gray
defining
minors
for
purposes
of
selling
3.2
beer.
this
is
why
i
think
that
is
there
intent
in
?72
which
is
critical
here
and
not
necessarily
the
intent
they
may
have
had
years
ago.
the
purpose
that
the
trial
court
found
is
one
of
which
we
have
asserted
which
we
think,
though
we
cannot
document
it
with
committee
reports
or
this
sort
of
material
which
would
be
the
best
of
course,
is
to
reduce
the
traffic,
reduce
death,
the
injury,
and
property
damages.
the
court
applied
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no,
i
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no
your
honor.
i
cannot
think
of
better
ones
for
purposes
of
sale
of
beer
other
than
traffic
for
you
distinguished
between
the
sexes.
i
could
think
of
reasons
that
was
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
certainly.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
do
not
think
the
legislature
was
concerned
with
that
aspect
evident
in
this
legislation
because
the
same
statute
also
eliminates
from
consideration
a
parent
who
may
wish
to
give
his
child
beer.
this
is
not
prohibited
specifically
by
the
statute.
and
indeed
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
well,
i
think
it
only
eliminates
the
non-driving
members
of
the
class
as
a
reason
for
the
legislation.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
am
sure
there
is.
mr.
james
h.
gray
well,
i
am
sure
there
are
many
who
drink
beer
who
do
not
drive
with
all
licenses.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no
sir.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
think
it
can
because
of
the
nature
of
the
establishments
that
sell
beer,
many
of
them
are
package
stores,
7/11,
convenience
stores,
grocery
stores,
where
you
--
in
our
society
today,
mostly
drive
to
get
to.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no
sir,
because
drinking
it
without
driving
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no
sir,
i
am
not
saying
it
did
not
think
it
but
i
am
saying
that
the
statute
and
i
would
have
to
be
a
candid
to
say
it
is
not
perfect.
it
is
true
that
does
not
solve
all
of
the
problems
even
if
our
offered
reasons
are
true.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
think
it
does
reduce
the
amount
of
traffic
involved
accidents
in
this
age
group
which
will
affect
the
general
population.
mr.
james
h.
gray
a
reduction,
no
sir.
the
figures
we
have
submitted
to
the
court
did
not
show
reductions
but
show
percentages
of
involvement.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no
sir.
on
the
contrary,
the
fbi
statistics
show
that
the
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
sir.
mr.
james
h.
gray
not
specifically
other
than
the
preference
for
beer
in
the
statistics
on
the
roadside
survey
exhibit
3,
i
would
recall.
mr.
james
h.
gray
the
statistics
do
not.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
sir,
this
has
been
submitted
by
the
appellants
and
i
think
it
is
simply
not
true.
counsel
relies
on
oklahoma
case
which
he
says
and
means
that
3.2%
alcohol
by
weight
in
beer
is
non-intoxicating
when
in
fact
it
is
intoxicating.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no
sir
i
am
not
sure;
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
it.
mr.
james
h.
gray
the
case
i
have
cited
in
our
brief
is
douglas
v.
state
and
it
went
into
an
effort
at
that
time
to
avoid
a
conviction
on
dui
charge
but
i
wanted
to
cross-examine
the
officer
about
what
kind
of
beverage
he
had
been
drinking.
the
effort
being
there
to
require
the
state
to
prove
that
3.2
beer
was
intoxicating
because
i
think
the
record
was
to
show
that
it
is
all
he
had
to
drink.
our
court
said
that
was
not
necessary,
it
was
not
an
error
because
our
penal
statutes,
the
act
to
the
fact
statute,
the
dui,
reckless
driving
so
forth
and
so
on
which
could
be
involved
in
alcohol
problem.
it
does
not
matter,
the
court
says.
what
kind
of
alcoholic
beverage
you
drink
as
long
as
you
are
intoxicated?
so,
i
do
not
think
this
premise
is
correct.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
believe
that
is
true.
when
you
consider
the
exact
amount
of
alcohol
intake,
the
average
male
with
myself
an
exception
being
larger
than
females
would
be
able
to
assimilate
more
alcohol
without
being
any
break
than
the
corresponding
females.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
yes
to
the
extent
that
it
would
at
least
be
a
concrete
physiological
difference
which
would
not
be
won
based
on
old
notions
and
stereotyping
and
so
forth.
but
i
think
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes,
if
it
is
not
based
on
a
ground
of
difference
which
has
no
relation
to
the
objective
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
well,
the
court
has
nothing
but
what
the
state
attorney
general?s
office
presented
as
evidence
is
its
best
judgment
on
the
legislative
purpose.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
sir,
i
have
to
be
candid
with
the
court.
sir,
i
have
nothing
to
offer
of
a
concrete
nature
as
to
the
actual
reasons.
the
legislature
chose
to
change
this
statute,
not
change
it
but
to
add
a
definition
to
this
statute.
oklahoma
just
does
not
keep
that
record
ordinarily
and
i
am
not
personally
aware
of
it.
by
the
same
token,
i
cannot
assume
that
mr.
gilbert?s
comment
was
necessarily
correct
and
that
sectarian
influence
was
the
real
reason.
i
am
not
aware
of
that
either.
mr.
james
h.
gray
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
i
put
mcgowan
in
the
brief.
we
had
tried
to
adapt
the
trial
court?s
determination
that
reed
v.
reed
was
the
test
and
i
do
not
disagree
with
that.
i
think
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
requiring
this
classification
to
be
subject
to
close
judicial
scrutiny
and
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does,
and
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases.
some
of
which
that
the
counsel
asked
that
this
court
reversed.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
sir.
we
have
stated
there
some
before
and
some
after,
we
have
stated
crowley
and
christensen
in
1890,
and
go
through
with
such
decisions
as
the
goesaert
decision
which
was
after
the
1948
law.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
your
honor,
the
reason
outside
of
those
earlier
cases
is
to
show
primarily
a
history
of
this
court
supporting,
under
the
tenth
amendment,
the
state?s
power
to
regulate
intoxicating
beverages.
this
power
is
crystallized
in
the
twenty-first
amendment.
each
of
those
cases
i
think
without
exception
that
i
have
cited
both
from
1890
and
through
goesaert
in
1948,
all
involved
and
an
attack
on
equal
protection
basis.
none
of
them
involved
a
sexual
classification
except
for
goesaert.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
your
honor,
and
we
have
cited
that
statement
in
our
brief.
i
do
not
know
quite
frankly
i
cannot
evaluate
that
now
in
light
of
reed
v.
reed
and
california
v.
larue.
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no,
it
did
not.
it
was
an
administrative
appointment
situation.
but
we
do
think
that
california
v.
larue
is
close
to
this
case.
it
did
not
involve
a
sexual
classification
but
in
its
own
way
i
think
it
was
a
more
difficult
decision
and
more
difficult
problem
than
the
case
of
boren.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
the
activity
sought
to
be
curtailed
by
california
was
to
prohibit
live
sexual
entertainment
in
those
establishments
which
it
licensed
to
sell
liquor
by
the
drink.
some
of
those
activities
were
i
think
admitted
by
this
court
to
or
would
have
been
ordinarily
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
in
our
case,
the
activity
which
is
being
restricted
that
is
the
ability
to
purchase
beer
is
not
we
think
and
we
have
cited
authorities,
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
certainly,
equal
protection
is
the
question
here.
we
are
not
minimizing
that
but
even
with
first
amendment
rights
at
stake,
the
court
are
feeling
california
v.
larue
still
recognized
the
presumption
in
favor
of
regulations
authorized
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no,
it
does
not
and
it
would
be
all
inclusive.
the
statute
would
be
all
inclusive.
mr.
james
h.
gray
we
do
rely
on
that,
your
honor.
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
you.
if
i
am
correct
in
assuming
that
importation
of
intoxicating
liquors
is
not
the
only
intoxicating
liquors
that
may
be
controlled
on
the
twenty-first
amendment.
then
that
authority
is
clear
that
equal
protection
attacks
as
cited
in
the
1890
case
and
through
goesaert
in
1948
have
all
rejected
equal
protection
attacks
against
regulations
whether
it
was
requiring
a
bond,
requiring
an
importer?s
license.
all
of
these
things
which
were
asserted
to
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
were
not
accepted
on
that
basis
because
of
the
broad
authority
whether
they
went
from
the
10th
or
through
the
twenty-first
in
deciding
in
my
opinion.
but
i
am
wondering
and
i
am
wondering
if
though
ostensively
in
my
class
favor,
the
strong
language
about
the
twenty-first
amendment
cannot
be
struck
down
by
the
fourteenth
and
so
i
wonder
if
it
is
that
strong.
i
wonder
if
reed
and
reed
and
even
california
v.
larue
would
still
allow
such
quite
a
strong
statement
today.
but
i
think
irregardless,
the
trial
court
in
our
case,
found
from
evidence
which
you
concede
it
was
not
open
and
shut,
not
altogether
without
some
objections.
yet
i
think,
if
we
consider
that
legislatures
in
terms
of
what
is
admissible
as
evidence,
what
the
court
could
have
considered?
i
do
not
think
legislators
are
bound
to
consider
only
evidence
which
would
be
admissible
in
the
court
in
reaching
decision
as
to
legislation.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes
sir.
we
think
this
is
a
minimum
result
based
on
the
decision
in
california
v.
larue,
it
may
be
the
twenty-first
amendment,
should
be
even
more
influenced
on
this
case.
mr.
james
h.
gray
your
honor
i
would
not
pertain
and
i
think
the
state
has
already
confessed
to
this
(inaudible).
mr.
james
h.
gray
no
sir.
and
i
do
not
believe
we
will
and
we
have
tried
to
say
and
i
think
we
have
to
say
it
again
before
this
court
that
we
would
not
think
that
this
evidence
would
justify
a
racial
discrimination
on
the
purchase
of
beer
or
alcoholic
beverages
of
any
kind.
but
we
do
not
think
we
are
in
the
inherent
suspect
there
yet
either.
we
do
not
think
this
court
has
told
us
that
yet
and
we
think
that
under
the
retest
that
we
have
met
the
burden
to
show
our
rational
relationship.
mr.
james
h.
gray
well,
i
think
unless
the
presumption
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
stronger
than
i
feel
it
is
that
if
the
court
rejects
the
evidence,
then
yes,
we
would
probably
lose.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
think
so.
i
cannot
personally
feel
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
save
it
all
together
if
it
did
not
pass
the
other
test.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
think
so.
yes
sir,
i
think
it
was
an
absolute
prohibition
and
i
do
not
know
--
i
cannot
recall
when
it
changed,
but
i
believe
that
is
right
especially
in
territorial
days.
i
think
this
was
so
--
but
that
was
federal
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
none
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
james
h.
gray
none
that
i
know
of.
i
do
not
know
what
federal
regulations
there
might
be
--
reservations
but
i
do
not
know
of
anything
about
that
stuff.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no
sir,
i
think
all
of
those
laws
had
a
way
of
bending
at
the
appropriate
time.
your
honor,
i
would
disclose
i
think
by
--
perhaps
referring
to
one
other
case,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
to
my
knowledge
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
this
issue
directly.
the
council
does
cite
basset
v.
basset
which
was
decided
after
1972
which
was
a
court
of
appeals
decision
of
oklahoma.
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
a
parent
could
sue
an
emancipated
minor
for
a
tort,
the
minor
being
between
18
and
21
and
thus
subject
to
the
old
statutes.
the
cause
of
action
having
a
reason
before
1972.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
without
having
to
change
the
legal
theory
that
this
kind
of
an
action
should
not
be
allowed
anymore
or
this
rule
should
not
bar
the
action
anymore.
chose
instead
to
declare
all
18-21-year-old
minority
distinctions
prior
1972
as
unconstitutional
in
latter
reed
v.
reed.
the
court
did
not
deal
with
this
statute.
the
court
did
not
deal
with
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
we
feel
the
court
went
much
beyond
what
was
at
stake
in
that
particular
case
in
reaching
that
conclusion.
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma?s
rules
governing
that
case
indicate
that
being
a
court
of
appeals
decision
not
specifically
approved
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
is
persuasive
to
the
oklahoma
courts
only
but
it
is
not
precedent.
and
we
think
the
approved
precedent
for
this
case
is
the
decision
below.
first
time
it
has
come
to
(inaudible).
mr.
james
h.
gray
no,
your
honor.
we
have
not
proposed
that
argument
and
we
have
presumed
perhaps
the
rules
that
the
sale
of
3.2
beer
to
the
restricted
minority
in
this
case
would
subject
that
seller
to
sanctions,
and
perhaps
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
am
not
sure
the
seller
can
step-in
the
shoes
of
the
minority.
i
would
have
to
say
that
we
have
considered
at
least
that
his
own
situation
was
sufficient
to
making
a
real
part
of
interest,
but
he
is
certainly
not
a
minor.
i
do
not
think
they
can
get
a
beer
a
license
until
they
are
21.
so
we
know
that
the
vendor
is
not
involved
in
this
statute.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes,
we
did.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no,
the
record
does
not
reflect
information.
i
know
that
in
oklahoma
at
least
until
you
are
25,
you
are
rated
pretty
heavily
in
terms
of
liability
insurance,
but
whether
or
not
they
distinguished
between
men
and
women,
i
do
not
know,
and
the
record
would
not
show.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
no,
because
that
would
not
have
made
an
alcohol
related
problem
at
all.
it
would
not
have
been
then
within
the
objective.
mr.
james
h.
gray
your
honor
we
did
not
feel
that
it
would
have
to
be
limited,
the
3.2
beer
or
itemize
this
3.2
beer
for
this
purpose
because
it
will
be
illegal
for
boys
or
girls,
either
one,
to
drink
an
alcoholic
beverage
in
excess
of
3.2
beer
until
they
are
21.
so
if
the
statistics
shows
that
there
is
an
alcohol
involvement
in
under
21
years
of
age
group,
then
it
is
illegal
purchase
automatically
for
boys.
it
might
have
been
for
girls.
if
it
was
hard
liquor
but
would
have
not
been
if
it
was
3.2
beer.
so
we
think
if
the
fact
that
there
is
alcohol
involvement
in
the
statistics,
some
of
them
is
sufficient,
not
that
it
has
to
be
related
to
just
the
one
beverage
3.2
beer.
the
hazard
is
the
same
and
they
are
both
(inaudible)
21.
mr.
james
h.
gray
except
for
the
roadside
surveys.
mr.
james
h.
gray
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
that
question.
and
i
would
like
to
try
to
answer
that
i
am
not
sure
--
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
yes,
i
am
afraid,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
gray
well,
with
the
minority
is
not
the
only
one.
these
boys
and
girls
in
this
restricted
class
of
course
are
only
part
of
that
restriction.
vendors
cannot
sell
it
to
them
either.
these
people,
we
can
expect
to
obey
the
law.
they
are
threatened
under
penalty
of
losing
their
license
if
they
do
not.
this
does
not
mean
the
law
is
perfect,
it
does
not
mean
that
these
boys
cannot
get
it
by
having
the
girlfriends
just
go
and
get
it.
this
counsel
quoted
out
it
is
not
a
perfect
solution.
we
do
not
think
it
is
unconstitutional.
