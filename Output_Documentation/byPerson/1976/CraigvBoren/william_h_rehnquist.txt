justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
stanton
v.
stanton
did
not
involve
intoxicating
beverages
or
the
twenty-first
amendment,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
you
say
?we?,
you
are
referring
to
your
client
who
is
the
tavern
keeper?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
no
potential
purchases
that
are
left
in
the
case,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn?t
that
he
technically
turned
21
or
i
take
it
i
mean
he
had
a
birthday?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
presume
he
no
longer
is
barred
by
oklahoma
law
from
buying
3.2%
beer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn?t
our
decision
in
sosna
say
in
that
case
you
bring
your
class
action
and
you
have
this
constantly
changing
spectrum
of
class
members?
and
if
the
one
that
is
the
name
plaintiff
no
longer
meets
the
standards,
someone
can
succeed
in
the
class
remain.
but
it
does
not
say
that
if
you
do
not
bring
a
class
action,
you
can
just
avoid
normal
mootness
doctrine.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
is
quite
a
different
point
though.
if
you
are
arguing
behalf
of
the
vendor
then
you
have
a
question
of
standing
that
if
that
does
not
support
your
argument
that
the
potential
purchaser
is
still
in
the
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
analytically
speaking,
can
we
really
give
your
vendor
client
any
relief?
if
we
decide
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination,
don?t
we
have
to
leave
it
up
to
the
state
of
oklahoma
to
decide
whether
all
minors
up
to
21
will
be
barred
or
all
minors
up
to
18
will
be
barred?
so
that
in
effect
to
your
client?s
position
may
be
worsened
if
you
win
the
laws.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
say,
?what
is
before
of
the
court??
what
is
before
the
court
is
your
complaint
that
it
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
to
treat,
say
women
can
buy
at
one
age
and
men
at
another?
now,
i
do
not
know
that
the
parties
are
free
under
our
decided
cases
to
say
you
may
only
decide
this
case
in
a
particular
way.
i
mean,
i
think
that
depends
on
the
trusted
argument.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
you
should
have
joined
them
as
indispensable
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
they
--
just
a
minute
--
even
though
the
legislature
had
statistics
that
may
have
shown
that
when
men
and
women
went
out
together,
men
were
more
often
drivers
than
women
were.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
there
were
statistics?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
that
means
that
the
law
of
that
justice
powell
was
talking
about
would
be
arguably
in
improvement
and
safety.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
court
ever
hold
that
discrimination
of
this
sort
is
of
the
same
class
as
discrimination
the
basis
of
race?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
asked
you
a
question,
has
it
ever
held?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
cronin
v.
adams
has
to
be
overruled
if
you
were
to
prevail
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
are
you
asking
that
it
would
be
overruled?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
one
of
justice
brandeis?
opinion
contains
a
statement,
doesn?t
it,
that
what
is
the
proper
classification
under
the
--
what
is
permitted
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
cannot
be
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
reed
v.
reed
did
not
involve
anything
to
do
with
the
alcoholic
beverage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes
sir.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
honor,
although
i
am
not
going
and
pretend
to
be
the
scholar
i
perhaps
should
be
in
the
history
of
the
interpretation
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
can
say
only
that
it
was
my
impression
that
it
was
not
that
strictly
limited
in
its
application
in
terms
of
regulatory
authority
over
those
kinds
of
beverages.
but
even
if
that
is
true,
surely
under
the
tenth
amendment,
the
police
powers
of
the
state,
that
the
state
has
the
authority
to
regulate
this
industry,
as
long
as
it
does
so
in
a
reasonable
manner.
this
is
always
a
standard
test.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes
sir,
and
it
refers
to
importing
or
in
