mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
directly
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
the
oklahoma
beer
law
which
says
that
females
may
buy
beer
at
18,
3.2%
beer
at
18,
but
males
must
wait
until
they
are
21
years
of
age.
this
is
an
age-sex
discrimination
for
persons
18,
19,
and
20
years
of
age.
the
law
is
broad
and
all
encompassing
in
its
suite.
it
says
that
all
females
even
those
that
are
the
most
drunk,
most
alcoholic,
most
immature,
and
most
irresponsible,
may
purchase
3.2%
beer
at
age
18
at
absolutely
unlimited
point.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor.
the
law
does
not
say
it
quite
the
words
that
all
males
18
to
21,
even
though
they
are
the
most
mature,
most
sober,
more
self-restrained
cannot
purchase
a
drop
of
it,
at
least
directly
until
they
are
21.
but
that
is
what
the
law
does.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
i
think
there
is
a
question
your
honor.
the
legislatures
concluded
that
beverages
in
concentrations
of
3.2%
alcohol
or
less
is
non-intoxicating.
in
fact,
not
only
the
legislature
or
popular
referendum
that
said
that
and
the
state?s
supreme
court
has
upheld
both
of
them.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
i
believe
the
relevance
comes
from
the
state?s
assertion
of
what
the
purpose
for
the
statute
it
is.
i
think
the
state
asserts
that
this
could
contribute
to
the
overall
drunkenness
problem
among
young
adults.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
your
honor
i
am
perhaps
exaggerating
the
point
there.
it
would
be
difficult;
i
would
hesitate
to
say
it
is
absolutely
impossible.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
very
well
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
alright,
now
the
real
legislative
purpose
for
this
discrimination,
we
do
not
know.
it
has
been
lost
in
the
mists
of
antiquity.
the
beer
law
that
we
challenge
today
was
originally
enacted
in
1890
by
the
first
territorial
legislature
as
part
of
a
generalized
civil
majority
statute
of
18
for
females
and
21
for
males
for
virtually
all
purposes
of
almost
exactly
the
same
type
of
statute
that
was
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court
last
year
in
stanton
v.
stanton.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor.
it
was
a
generalized
statute.
the
particular
issue
was
the
question
of
child
support
i
believe.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor
and
the
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
technically
he
turned
21
about
two
weeks
ago
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
that
is
correct
your
honor.
however,
i
believe,
under
some
of
your
abortion
cases
i
believe
that
the
mootness
would
not
be
a
bar
to
his
consideration
or
his
assertion
of
the
same
interest
which
has
been
asserting
throughout
the
litigation.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
the
reason
it
was
not
is
because
the
class
would
be
composed
of
all
males
18
to
21
in
oklahoma,
a
constantly
changing
class
and
the
cause
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
but
the
reason
was
that
because
it
is
a
limited
period
of
time
--
the
normal
flow
of
litigation
is
such
that
if
you
are
going
to
be
really
strict
about
the
mootness
point,
you
can
never
raise
the
question
and
the
protracted
litigation
of
this
court
is
further
example
of
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor,
and
this
case
is
now
into
its
fourth
year.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor,
defunis
was
more
or
less
individualized.
the
degree
to
which
that
person
was
claiming
reversed
discrimination
with
some
extent
depends
on
his
score
on
the
lsat,
the
favorite
class
score
in
the
lsat,
and
all
various
numbers
things,
but
in
this
case,
every
single
male,
18
to
21
would
have
identical
standard,
because
there
is
no
differentiation
under
the
standard
between
mature
young
man
and
immature
young
man.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor,
i
would
invite
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
actually
runs
against
the
vendor.
she
is
the
one
who
is
subject
to
penal
sanctions
and
administrative
sanctions
and
she
is
still
very
definitely
in
the
case.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
potential
purchaser
is
in
fact
21
but
i
believe
under
the
one
line
of
authority,
the
abortion
cases
that
there
is
no
real
problem.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
i
see
--
at
least
there
we
could
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor,
we
cannot
in
the
1983
action.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
alright,
so
we
are
asking
for
declaratory
relief,
we
can
still
ask
for
that
and
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor,
the
vendor
is
still
had
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor
it
is
not
really
so
much
the
vendee
who
needs
the
injunction,
it
is
the
vendor
who
is
trying
to
sell
because
the
vendee,
the
young
man,
he
can
drive
up
to
the
store
and
have
his
girlfriend
run
in
and
gets
the
beer.
that
is
legal.
what
is
needed
is
really
the
injunction
for
the
vendor
because
she
is
the
one
who
is
in
danger
of
losing
her
liquor
license
for
selling
the
stuff.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
in
a
technical
sense
like
women
who
had
actually
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
that
is
technical.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
it
would
mean
--
the
portion
of
the
statute
which
is
challenged
is
not
the
entire
discrimination.
it
is
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
purports
to
exclude
males
from
the
class
of
persons
18
to
21
from
purchasing
alcohol.
that
is
the
way
the
complaint
was
drafted
and
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
state
is
seemed
to
defend
the
action
throughout
this
four
years.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
the
only
thing
before
the
court
is
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
exclusion
of
the
males.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
it
would
be
like
the
doctors
to
some
extent
in
the
abortion
cases
or
the
vendor
of
contraceptive
articles
in
the
eisenstadt
v.
baird
case.
in
fact,
i
believe
in
your
recent
singleton
v.
wulff
case
last
year,
i
believe
went
into
this
standing
question
quite
to
some
extent.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
i
do
not
think
that
desire
of
privacy
(inaudible).
we
still
have
the
legal
problem.
if
the
vendor
sells
to
the
male
18
to
21
she
loses
her
license
and
she
is
subjected
to
possible
criminal
action.
i
think
that
standing
enough
right
there
certainly
under
the
eisenstadt
v.
baird,
the
contraceptive
cases.
that
is
where
the
penal
sanction
actually
runs.
and
of
anything,
i
think
mrs.
whitener
has
far
more
standing
even
if
we
did
have
a
class
section
of
young
men,
mrs.
whitener
would
really
be
the
party
on
this
case.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor.
there
is
no
sex
discrimination
of
the
vendor
could
vicariously
assert
in
that
case.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
alright.
your
honor
if
there
were
some
theory
of
law
supporting
an
argument
that
young
men
or
persons
down
to
17
should
buy
beer,
the
vendor
would
have
standing
to
assert
that
in
addition
to
the
17
year
olds.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor
that
i
do
not
--
let
me
say
the
first
thing,
if
the
legislature
wants
to
raise
the
age,
they
can
do
that
in
a
prospective
manner.
now,
in
judicial
action,
first
of
all,
the
way
the
complaint
disrupted
and
what
is
before
the
court
is
only
the
exclusion
of
the
males.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
alright,
let
me
explain
this.
first
of
all,
as
i
have
mentioned,
the
way
the
complaint
has
been
drafted.
second,
the
state
has
not
urged
this
alternative
argument
as
a
basis
for
supporting
the
denial
of
beer
to
young
men
18
to
21
and
i
happen
to
know
that
that
was
a
deliberate
decisions,
so
it
has
been
raised
by
either
side.
third
point,
this
is
due
process
question
which
was
not
touched
on
in
stanton
v.
stanton.
let
me
point
it
out,
if
the
legislature
wants
to
raise
the
age
or
take
away
a
vested
statutory
right,
the
legislature
does
not
have
to
give
notice.
but
if
the
court
wants
to
take
away
a
vested
statutory
right,
such
as
the
vested
statutory
right
of
females
18
to
21
to
purchase
beer,
it
cannot
be
done
in
a
judicial
action
without
giving
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard,
which
means
to
take
away
the
young
women?s
right
by
judicial
actions,
i
suppose
the
legislative
action,
you
have
to
turn
this
case
into
kind
of
a
third
party
cross-claim
class
action
and
serve
notice
on
all
females
18
to
21
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
argue
to
the
court,
why
that
should
not
be
done?
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
your
honor
if
we
would
have
the
money
to
have
a
class
action,
we
would
have
spent
it
on
getting
a
class
action
for
the
young
males.
but
that
is
why
the
state
incidentally
did
not
make
the
third
party
with
just
the
expense
of
impleading
an
entire
class.
now
that
is
why
to
resolve
an
inequality
by
taking
away
the
benefit
to
the
favorite
class,
i
submit
can
not
be
done
on
the
basis
of
judicial
action
without
impleading
the
favorite
class
to
come
in
and
be
heard
for
whatever
their
arguments
may
be
worth.
the
legislature
can
do
it
but
the
court
cannot.
furthermore,
in
stanton,
i
believe
there
was
a
question
of
remanding
to
the
state
courts.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
court.
there
is
no
state
court
to
remand
to.
as
i
believe,
there
is
some
general
rule
also
that
to
some
extent,
the
court
may
try
and
second
guess
a
legislature
since
18
seems
to
be
almost
the
universal
age
for
adulthood
now.
i
think
18
would
be
the
age.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
question
about
it.
the
legislature
has
gone
through
and
said
18
for
just
about
everything
in
oklahoma
except
despair
discrimination.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor,
kahn
was
a
question
i
believe
of
compensatory
discrimination
for
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
for
the
unfavored
sex.
i
think
it
is
clearly
inapplicable
in
this
case.
i
mean,
if
the
compensation
is
access
to
3.2%
beer,
the
only
way
that
could
be
compensation
for
anything
would
be
to
say
is
giving
young
women
an
opportunity
to
drown
their
sorrows
in
3.2%
beer
for
the
effects
of
past
discrimination
which
i
feel
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor
the
facts
which
the
legislature
took
judicial
notice
or
reacted
to
in
kahn
was
the
facts
that
the
past
discrimination.
it
was
not
really
based
upon
any
innate
difference
between
male
and
female,
and
there
is
no
base
as
in
this
record
to
say
that
the
legislature
even
remotely
thought
of
compensating
for
past
discrimination.
now,
the
difference
between
male
and
female
in
kahn
was
that
the
female
was
the
victim
of
discrimination
but
that
would
not
a
point
in
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
it
is
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
now,
as
i
was
saying,
the
statute
derived
in
its
origin
from
the
1890
legislature
and
there
are
many
theories
as
to
why
it
happened.
i
think
the
theory
that
there
was
maybe
a
legislative
intent
that
little
boys
were
little
devils
(ph)
and
little
girls
or
little
angels
it
is
as
good
as
anything
i
have
heard,
state
has
never
come
up
with
what
the
real
reason
was.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
minors
were
females
until
18
and
males
to
21.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
and
that
was
retained
in
oklahoma
until
1972.
now,
in
1972,
there
were
two
judicial
decisions
that
told
the
legislature,
this
could
not
survive.
one
was
this
court?s
decision
in
reed
v.
reed
and
the
other
was
a
tenth
circuit
decision
which
held
oklahoma?s
criminal
age-sex
discrimination
unconstitutional.
so
in
1972,
the
legislature
set
18
as
the
age
for
criminal
and
civil
majority
for
both
females
and
males
but
retained
it
for
this
one
purpose.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor,
nor
has
the
attorney
general
ever
told
us
why
there
is
no
real
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
i
can
make
a
statement
of
counsel
that
i
think
it
was
strictly
sectarian
impression.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
it
was
to
save
the
souls
of
young
men
18
to
21
from
exposure
to
cool
beer,
and
girls.
that
was
what
was
quoted
in
the
legislative
committee.
alright
now
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor,
but
that
does
get
us
into
the
next
question,
the
statistics
which
the
state
has
elected
to
rely
upon.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
it
is
a
kind
of
a
moot
question
because
we
know
what
the
real
reason
was.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
alright,
the
hypothetical
answer
would
be
if
they
are
concerned
about
safety
from
irresponsible
young
adults,
they
are
going
to
have
to
say
all
irresponsible
young
adults
regardless
of
race,
breed,
color,
sex,
and
whatever.
they
cannot
single
out
one
particular
group
of
teenagers
just
on
the
accident
of
their
birth
and
say,
we
are
going
to
say
that
these
people
are
just
congenitally
dangerous
and
deny
them
the
right
to
buy
non-intoxicating
beer.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
alright,
first
of
all,
there
were
not
any
statistics.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
alright,
your
honor,
the
mere
fact
that
there
are
more
men
on
the
road
does
not
mean
that
the
individual
male
is
any
more
dangerous.
now
may
be
since
there
are
more
men
on
the
road,
there
may
be
more
men
just
by
the
flaws,
natural
statistics
getting
involved
in
collisions
that
in
fact
would
be
almost
inevitable.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
individual
male
is
any
more
dangerous
just
because
he
is
a
member
of
a
class
or
has
been
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor,
i
would
say
anything
could
be
--
you
could
pass
a
law
saying,
?no
negro
will
drive
while
intoxicated.?
now
this
relates
to
the
public
thing
that
the
thing
is
you
cannot
discriminate
even
for
something
like
public
safety
on
the
basis
of
certain
criteria.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor,
this
court
has
come
very,
very
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no,
it
is
never
held
but
it
is
just
totally
to
be
treated
the
same
as
race
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor,
or
it
could
be
tactfully
ignored.
there
is
another
candidate
in
that
same
category.
i
would
submit
for
your
honors,
the
consideration
is
goesaert
v.
cleary.
i
feel
that
goesaert
is
to
sex
as
plessy
v.
ferguson
was
to
race
and
should
be
treated
accordingly.
in
fact,
as
i
read
the
goesaert
decision,
it
was
considerably
worst
than
plessy
in
the
race
because
plessy,
while
saying
that
the
un-favored
race
would
have
to
have
its
education
and
facilities
and
so
forth
separately,
plessy
never
went
so
far
to
say
the
un-favored
sex
could
be
denied
these
things
all
together.
but
goesaert
went
so
far
to
say
the
un-favored
sex
could
be
denied
these
things
all
together.
so
that
is
one
way
i
view
goesaert
is
being
considerably
worst
than
plessy
v.
ferguson.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
it
was
not
directly
overruled,
as
your
honor
knows.
it
was
quietly
put
to
rest.
as
an
example
of
the
mentality
of
the
age
which
gave
it
birth.
i
would
actually
ask
no
more
than
for
cronin
and
for
goesaert.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor.
well,
the
founding
fathers
we
might
say
really
did
not
do
away
with
slavery
either
but
we
do
not
look
it
that
way.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
i
cannot
remember
who
wrote
--
goesaert
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
mr.
bradley
or
justice
frankfurter?
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
no
your
honor.
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
such
laws
anymore.
i
think
they
derived
from
the
time
when
certain
indians
under
the
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
not
us
citizens
of
the
time,
the
so-called
wild
indians.
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
such
laws
that
stand
at
the
present
time.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
your
honor?
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
i
do
not
believe
it
is
a
complete
provision
for
intoxicants.
according
to
the
state
constitution
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
i
am
unfamiliar
with
that
your
honor.
now,
there
are
certain
restrictions
to
restricted
indians
that
they
have
to
do
with
conveyance
of
land
and
so
forth.
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
--
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
but
it
is
not
that
way
now.
that
was
back
in
territorial
days.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
all
right,
your
honor
we
have
some
statistics
in
this
case
and
this
is
what
the
court
claims
separate
this
case
from
everything
else.
i
have
examined
the
statistics
in
detail
in
my
proposition
too.
i
would
point
out
one
very
salient
thing
and
i
think
that
sets
the
tone
for
all
the
other
defects.
the
statistics
are
arrest
statistics.
they
are
not
conviction
statistics.
all
the
statistics
show
is
that
young
men
are
suspected
by
the
police
more
often
or
are
accused
by
the
police
more
often
for
alcohol
related
offenses
than
young
women.
that
is
it.
and
the
statistics
go
downhill
right
from
there.
i
do
not
have
time
for
detailed
discussion
of
them
but
we
do
have
this.
now,
i
have
another
thought
on
these
statistics.
when
you
look
at
the
non-arrest
rates,
the
sobriety
rates,
it
is
something
like
98%
of
the
males
and
99%
of
the
females,
plus
or
minus
1%
or
2%
differential.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
well,
i
think
the
law
presumes
that,
your
honor.
there
is
a
presumption
of
innocence
and
anyway,
if
it
is
the
state
statute
and
they
are
trying
to
defend
a
suspect
type
for
scrutinize
classification,
i
think
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
them
to
come
in
for
something
more
than
we
suspect
that
young
males
are
guilty
more
often
that
girls.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
not
for
proving
that
some
group
is
inherently
irresponsible
or
criminal
or
deleterious
and
something.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
i
believe
2%
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
is
irrational
in
a
sense
of
it.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
right,
yes
your
honor.
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
on
these
statistics.
all
we
have
got
and
what
i
called
the
sobriety,
i
take
the
liberty
of
calling
the
sobriety
ratio,
is
if
it
is
only
a
1%
or
2%
difference
that
is
the
way
you
juggle
the
statistics
depending
on
which
acts
you
have
got
deprived.
i
leave
the
court
with
a
thought
before
i
sit
down
for
rebuttal.
that
if
that
is
all
it
takes
to
get
around
the
equal
protection
clause.
let
us
forget
equal
protection.
there
will
always
be
a
couple
of
percentage
difference
between
any
two
groups
you
separate.
black
versus
white,
male
versus
female,
catholic
versus
protestant,
whichever
group
the
legislature
is
out
to
get
if
all
they
have
to
do
is
relying
on
statistics
like
what
happened
below,
then
i
think,
it
will
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
equal
protection.
furthermore,
just
to
run
into
my
rebuttal
time
just
a
moment.
a
discrimination
based
on
sex
is
like
race
because
it
is
an
accident
of
birth
which
cannot
be
changed
and
for
at
least
99%
of
human
activity.
it
has
absolutely
no
relationship
to
one?s
character,
ability,
confidence,
sobriety,
or
anything
else.
now,
if
race
is
going
to
be
treated
differently
from
sex,
it
can
only
be
because
in
sex,
there
are
some
organic
differences
which
for
limited
purposes
might
be
relevant,
and
we
have
no
analogy
between
the
races.
but
for
a
non-organic
discriminations
like
this
i
think
it
is
indistinguishable
for
race
and
i
ask
this
court,
although
it
is
not
necessary
to
this
case
because
the
statistics
really
would
not
pass
even
rational
relationship
muster,
to
maybe
clear
the
air
say
that
sex
discrimination
is
not
based
on
organic
differences
and
can?t
be
treated
the
same
as
racial
differences.
thank
you.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes,
very
brief.
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
this
question
of
standing
my
distinguished
co-counsels
offered
me
to
invite
your
attention
to
two
cases,
barrows
v.
jackson
in
346
u.s.
and
sullivan
v.
little
hunting
park
in
396
u.s.
that
a
white
owner
of
real
estate
wishing
to
sell
to
negroes
does
have
standing
to
assert
the
equal
protection
rights
of
negro
vendees.
and
i
think
that
is
relevant
to
the
question
here.
mr.
frederick
p.
gilbert
yes,
your
honor.
well,
precisely
here,
it
is
the
same
thing.
also
on
this
question
about
the
boys
being
able
to
get
their
liquors
somehow,
this
is
just
part
of
the
old
thing
in
oklahoma
that
dries
have
had
their
law
and
the
wets
have
had
their
liquor
kind
of
the
gentleman?s
agreement.
but
i
will
tell
you
who
really
is
the
loser
in
this
game
is
the
vendor
who
around
election
time
can
always
expect
to
be
rated
by
the
local
law.
that
goes
to
the
stanton.
now,
getting
intoxicated
on
3.2,
let
me
just
say
something
factually
from
my
own
experience.
3.2
is
so
diluted
that
the
normal
man
will
get
extremely
bloated
on
the
stuff
before
he
can
get
drunk.
it
is
possible
to
get
drunk
but
you
have
to
force
it
down.
it
is
difficult
to
get
drunk
on
3.2.
the
question
was
made
about
sex
in
the
larue
case.
that
is
a
different
kind
of
sex
and
what
we
have
got
involved
in
that
case.
that
sex
is
activity.
this
sex
is
a
biological
grouping.
if
this
court
would
have
pulled
the
rule
saying,
you
do
not
have
to
serve
or
you
cannot
serve
liquor
at
a
horse
race,
you
would
not
say
that
the
state
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
can
regulate
the
alcoholic
race
relationship
because
that
is
using
race
in
a
different
sense
than
the
normal
sense.
so
that
is
why
i
am
trying
to
explain
the
difference
between
sex
in
larue
and
sex
here.
it
is
the
same
word
that
they
mean
two
different
things.
these
statistics
--
i
want
to
mention
one
thing,
they
all
date
from
1973.
there
are
some
dates
from
1972
but
they
were
not
published
until
1973.
so
this
court
has
liberated
to
take
whatever
inference
it
wants
to
what
was
or
what
was
not
before
the
legislature
when
this
statute
was
passed.
okay,
i
just
have
one
other
thought,
i
leave
you
with
the
thought
that
sobriety
differential
of
1
or
2%
in
this
case
was
far
less
than
the
business
experience
differential
in
reed
v.
reed
or
the
dependent
differential
between
husbands
and
wives
and
frontiero
at
first
and
so
forth,
frontiero
v.
richardson.
we
are
really
dealing
with
something
almost
de
minimis
in
the
sobriety
ratio.
to
get
the
seeming
imbalance,
you
have
to
juggle
the
statistics
and
try
to
discuss
in
my
brief.
well,
i
do
not
have
time
for
parting
thought
i
thank
you
for
your
time.
