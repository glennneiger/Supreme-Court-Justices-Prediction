unknown
speaker
the
law
does
not
say
it
in
quite
those
words,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
i
gather
there
is
no
question
in
the
case
that
drinking
3.2%
beer
may
make
one
intoxicated.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
suggestion
that
women
can
get
drunk
in
3.2%
beer?
unknown
speaker
even
though
one,
can?t
get
drunk?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
some
of
us
do
remember
3.2%
there.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
say
that
this
is
not
a
class
action,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
then
why
is
it
not
a
class
action?
unknown
speaker
and
isn?t
that
true
the
class
in
the
abortion
cases?
it
was
only
a
nine
month
run
there.
unknown
speaker
well
you
have
three
years
here.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
avoid
the
precedent
of
the
defunis?
unknown
speaker
counsel,
if
you
prevail
here,
what
is
the
result
of
the
oklahoma
law?
does
it
mean
that
all
people
under
21
or
all
people
under
18th
are
forbidden?
unknown
speaker
are
you
positive
about
this?
unknown
speaker
you
might
win
a
(inaudible)
victory.
unknown
speaker
will
you
explain
a
little
bit
for
me
how
the
vendor
here
has
standing?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in
the
singleton
though
i
think
we
relied
somewhat
on
the
fact
that
the
patient
would
be
reluctant
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
here,
your
vendees
were
not
reluctant
at
all.
your
single
vendee
was
not
reluctant
at
all.
and
hence,
i
wonder
about
the
soundness
of
you
are
equating
the
relationship
between
the
bar
and
its
customer,
with
that,
between
the
doctor
and
his
patient.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
have
to
say
the
same
thing
about
persons
8
to
17.
unknown
speaker
she
is
injured
just
as
much
as
--
unknown
speaker
in
1890
i
guess,
the
prohibition
against
sell
to
minors
and
there
was
another
statute
that
defined
some
purposes
of
civil
part
--
unknown
speaker
--
tells
that
were
minors
onto
what?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
how
you
got
the
distinction
18
to
21
in
the
1890
or
something.
unknown
speaker
and
the
legislature
to
tell
us
why
they
would
think
--
unknown
speaker
didn?t
you
have
a
lot
of
religious
groups?
unknown
speaker
were
they
not
in
fact
questions
of
that
kind
in
the
oklahoma?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
why
it
was
distinguished.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
may
i
ask
this
question
before
you
go
on?
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
legislature
and
appropriate
committee
had
conducted
hearings
and
come
up
with
findings
that
legislation
of
this
character
was
required
in
the
public
interest
about
safety.
would
that
affect
your
position
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
if
it
was
perfectly
clear,
that
the
legislative
purpose
was
safety
on
the
highways
primarily,
would
that
change
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
am
not
suggesting
what
the
real
reason
was.
i
have
no
idea
what
it
was.
i
was
asking
you
a
hypothetical
question.
unknown
speaker
first
harlan
and
mr.
justice
holmes
was
participated
in
cronin
v.
adams
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
gather,
mr.
justice
bradley
wrote
--
unknown
speaker
justice
frankfurter.
unknown
speaker
mr.
frankfurter.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
that
if
there
are
any
state
laws
still
testing
that
to
prohibit
are
limit
to
the
sale
of
intoxicants
to
indians.
unknown
speaker
but
counsel,
for
that
argument
do
you
not
necessarily
assume
that
everyone
who
was
never
been
arrested
has
never
been
drunk?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position
that
a
legislature
may
never
rely
on
statistical
evidence
based
on
the
numbers
of
arrests?
unknown
speaker
what
percentage
was
the
total
18
to
21
male
population
as
represented
by
the
rest
of
the
statistics?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
that
at
the
very
least
it
is
over
inclusive?
98%
of
them
be
denied
3.2
beer
because
2%
might
--
unknown
speaker
over
inclusive.
unknown
speaker
was
it
running
legislative
hearing?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
is
it
your
submission
that
we
simply
have
no
evidence,
whatever?
why
the
legislature
of
oklahoma
retained
this
distinction?
in
this
law,
when
it
abolished
it
for
a
lot
of
purposes.
unknown
speaker
for
which
the
legislature
undoubtedly
passed
it.
where
do
you
get
the
basis
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
really
conjectures,
isn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
what
about
--
i
understand
that
it
was
considerable
pressure
by
sectarian
groups
of
that
time
upon
the
legislature
to
retain
this
distinction.
is
that
so
or
not?
unknown
speaker
am
i
correct
that
that
was
certainly
true
indeed
that
was
since
1890s,
isn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
a
general
statute
which
for
civil
and
criminal
purposes
made
this
distinction.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
all
erased,
wasn?t
it,
in
1971
or
?72
with
the
exception
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
retained
it
for
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
really
what
you
arguing
is
that
might
have
been
a
very
legitimate
reason.
unknown
speaker
but
you
cannot
say
that
that
was
indeed
the
reason
they
retained.
unknown
speaker
general
gray,
does
this
statute
prohibit
an
18-year-old
male
from
drinking
3.2
beer?
unknown
speaker
then,
how
can
it
be
related
to
the
objective
you
described?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
legislature
we
are
concerned
with
your
objective,
don?t
you
think
they
would
have
made
it
unlawful
for
an
18-year-old
to
drink
this
dangerous
product?
unknown
speaker
if
a
boy
and
a
girl
of
the
same
age
go
out
together,
the
girl
can
go
and
invite
her
and
they
can
drink
it
together?
unknown
speaker
but
the
legislature
just
did
not
think
of
that
eventually,
is
that
your
assumption?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
would
show
anything
at
all
about
3.2
beer?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
gathered,
the
premise
has
been
that
3.2
beer
is
not
intoxicating.
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
congress
found
that
it
was
in
fact
at
about
1933
or
1934
under
volstead
act.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
did?
unknown
speaker
some
of
us
were
around
when
the
volstead
act
came.
unknown
speaker
general
gray,
may
i
ask
one
other
thing
while
you
are
interrupted?
to
the
extent
that
the
evidence
does
shed
any
light
on
the
difference
if
any
and
in
fact
on
males
and
females
of
the
consumption
of
alcohol,
it
tends
to
indicate
that
males
because
they
are
larger
can
absorb
alcohol
better
than
females.
isn?t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
assuming
that
is
a
fact
just
for
the
purposes
of
my
hypothetical
question,
do
you
think
that
evidence
would
be
sufficient
to
support
the
opposite
discrimination
from
the
one
that
the
state
elected
to
have;
in
other
words
would
that
evidence
have
been
sufficient
to
provide
an
adequate
constitutional
basis
for
discriminating
against
females
but
in
favor
of
males.
unknown
speaker
but
your
theory
then
is
that
any
rational
basis
is
sufficient
to
sustain
this
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
but
how
do
we
know
what
the
objective
of
the
statute
was?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
it
is
related
to
what
the
litigant
says,
he
believes
is
a
reasonable
assumption
as
to
the
objective
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
you
have
cited
the
early
cases
decided
in
awake
of
the
adoption
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
those
opinions
written
by
this,
mr.
justice
brandeis
must
have
--
the
state
v.
young?s
market
(ph)
and
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
i
think
what
the
justice
stewart
was
talking
about
with
the
twenty-first
amendment
which
was
adapted
somewhere
in
the
30s.
so
a
case
in
1890
would
have
been
before
that
rather
than
after.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
does
the
record
show
whether
the
3.2
beer
in
this
case
was
imported
into
the
state
or
manufactured
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
the
second
clause
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
very
specific.
it
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
brandies
in
the
state
board
v.
young?s
market
co.
back
in
1936,
and
refers
to
importation
or
transportation
into
the
state.
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
be
a
very
--
it
might
be
a
dispositive
fact
in
this
case,
might
it
not,
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
unknown
speaker
the
specific
authority
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that
was
the
condition
upon
its
recommendation
by
the
congress
to
the
states
for
adoption.
it
is
a
great
deal
of
history
behind
it
and
you
have
a
specific
provision
in
the
second
clause
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
but,
ruled
on
the
police
file
as
?strengthened?
by
the
twenty-first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
this
is
used
to
strengthen,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
oklahoma
could
pass
laws
and
no
negro
can
have
a
drink
of
beer.
unknown
speaker
i
personally
hope
you
do
not
go
that
far?
unknown
speaker
then
where
could
you
go,
do
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
okay,
rejected,
it
is
said
it
is
not
sufficient
to
show
them,
it
meets
the
reasonableness
test,
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
did
oklahoma
ever
have
laws
prohibiting
or
limiting
the
sale
of
beer
or
other
beverages
to
indians?
unknown
speaker
no
special
laws
in
the
books
down
there.
unknown
speaker
in
oklahoma?
or
any
other
states
you
know
of?
unknown
speaker
to
the
state
law
as
it
could
not
apply
to
judges
on
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
could
it?
but
judge
befort
(ph)
was
the
chief
judge,
i
am
sure
it
did
not
apply
to
him.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
you
to
object
to
the
seller
of
beer
asserting
his
own
rights
in
this
case,
but
do
you
or
have
you
ever
in
this
case
argued
that
he
has
no
right
to
assert
the
rights
of
the
young
men
under
21?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
basis
for
the
claim
that
there
is
an
escalated
standard
in
this
case
is
that
it?s
a
sex
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
and
your
position
is
that
the
seller
may
make
that
sort
of
a
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
district
court,
you
had
to
defend
claims
by
both,
didn?t
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gray.
unknown
speaker
the
record
show
whether
or
not
there
is
any
distinction
made
in
the
insurance
rates
charged
for
public
liability
insurance,
young
women
as
against
young
men?
unknown
speaker
general
gray,
your
statistical
evidence,
i
believe
contending
substance
shows
that
there
are
more
male
drivers
than
females
in
this
age
bracket
and
be
that
they
do
more
drinking
than
the
females
do.
unknown
speaker
that
is
basically
which
boils
down
and
therefore
there
is
a
greater
hazard.
unknown
speaker
would
you
consider
it
is
sufficient
as
sustained
statute
if
you
had
merely
shown
that
males
are
more
frequently
drivers
than
females?
you
have
to
have
--
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
enough?
you
have
not
proven
that
it
is
a
3.2
beer
related
problem.
i
try
to
figure
out
just
exactly
what
your
syllogism
is.
unknown
speaker
to
me
that
the
statistics
relate
entirely
to
the
law
violators,
don?t
they?
unknown
speaker
you
are
assuming
that
these
law
violators
would
obey
this
law
but
not
those
other
ones,
that
is
what
your
statistics
relate
to.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
statistical
evidence
is
based
primarily
at
least
on
arrests.
you
are
presuming,
i
know
you
first
of
course
presumed
innocent
but
for
statistical
purposes
and
legislative
purposes,
you
are
assuming
those
are
people
who
have
in
fact
violated
the
law.
unknown
speaker
they
violated
laws
now
on
the
books.
but
you
are
presuming
they
will
all
obey
this
law
in
order
for
this
law
to
accomplish
its
objective.
unknown
speaker
kind
of
an
anomalies
method
of
proving
this
legislative
purpose.
